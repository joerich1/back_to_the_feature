ARCTIC BLUE
by Ross LaManna

FADE IN
1 EXT BOREAL FOREST - ALASKA - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Flying Not at the intangible height of a jet but at
spitting distance from the treetops Were in central
Alaska the Big Lonely just north of the Arctic Circle

A thick forest follows the contours of mountain foothills
like a deep-pile carpet Up at treeline the forest thins to
tundra a grassy scruff turning red and yellow with the
coming of autumn

On the horizon the hills rise to meet the Endicott
Mountains a great fortress wall of granite so sharp and
jagged that snow cannot stick to its face This is how all
North America once looked -- raw indomitable

Then abruptly coming into the SCENE is a colossal etching
across the landscape too deliberate to be of natural origin
Bisecting this country like a metallic ribbon -- or a scar
depending on your point of view -- is the 800-mile-long
Trans-Alaskan Pipeline

Even the immensity of the pipeline is rendered insignificant
by the vastness of the land It goes on and on and on

DISSOLVE TO

A lone MAN walks along the Haul Road a one-lane gravel
trail running parallel to the pipeline The weather turns
sour -- rough wind and stinging snow cut across the mans
path

DISSOLVE TO

The man is ERIC DESMOND twenty-four clean-shaven
determined Hes clearly out of place here dressed in a
business suit and a light camel-hair topcoat

Eric is trying to follow some footprints in the snow -- a
predators tracks those of a wolf or coyote But the

footprints ahead have faded covered by the snow and wind

DISSOLVE TO
The weather becomes more oppressive Heavy snow gale winds

and sub-zero temperatures make his progress tortuous Eric
strives stubbornly forward

DISSOLVE TO

Eric has gathered some branches He tries to make a fire
Moisture from his breath has frozen in the upturned collar
of his insufficient coat and his skin is split raw from the
cold

His hands are too numb to hold the matches After several
attempts at striking one he slumps down next to the pile of
wood exhausted and frustrated

DISSOLVE TO

The snow has covered the pile of branches Eric still sits
next to it partially covered in snow himself

ERIC

His face is a death mask eyes half-open and dull lips a
purplish blue bloodless skin crystallizing as it ices over
The wind HOWLS around him The snow sticks to his eyelashes
and hair without melting

DREAM
2 INT DARK BEDROOM - NIGHT

Eric bolts up in bed Next to him ANNE MARIE GAUVIN sits
up and hugs him All that can be seen of her in the dark is
a lovely silhouette and a cascade of dark hair After a
moment Eric kisses her He shakes off the dream and lies
back down

3 EXT HAUL ROAD AND PIPELINE - CLOSE - DAY

A metal sign peppered with shotgun holes is posted near a
pipeline support piling

PIPELINE UTILITY CORRIDOR
PRIVATE PROPERTY
NO TRESPASSING

NO HUNTING
NO TRAPPING
NO SHOOTING

WIDER

Eric walks quietly past the sign intent on something ahead
of him Although still somewhat boyish in appearance hes
confident and resolute in attitude His clothes have a
distinctly western feel Lucchese boots Levis 501s Mahan
cotton shirt His down parka is unzipped in the sunny
windless forty-degree afternoon

END

He pauses then brings to his shoulder a rifle with a
four-power scope mounted atop it He peers through the
scope

HIS POV - THROUGH SCOPE

He puts the crosshairs on the shoulder flank of a big
ivory-white timber wolf fifty yards away

BACK TO SCENE

Anne Marie stands beside Eric a Nikon with a telephoto lens
in her hand holding her breath in anticipation Shes
twenty-three pretty with soft features and piercing blue
eyes She wears Eddie Bauer womans gear like she was born
in it

Eric expertly fixes his aim and slowly squeezes the trigger
But instead of a loud retort there is only the dull POP of
a CO2-powered dart gun

NEW ANGLE

The tranquilizer dart finds its mark in the wolfs fleshy
shoulder The wolf takes off running but almost
immediately slows sits then lies down

Eric and Anne Marie hurry over to the wolf who is breathing
deeply Eric kneels next to him and strokes his thick fur

ERIC
What a beauty
(to Anne Marie)
Hand me the transmitter

Anne Marie passes to Eric a tiny weatherproof homing device
attached to a steel collar band Eric puts the collar
loosely around the wolfs neck and crimps it in place all
the while TALKING soothingly to the semi-conscious animal
Anne Marie smiles at Erics tenderness and snaps some
photos

With the collar in place and transmitter activated Eric
backs away while the wolf tries to rouse itself from its
narcosis

ERIC
(continuing)
Hes coming around fine

ANNE MARIE
Be right back I left my
camcorder in the car

3 FOLLOW ANNE MARIE

as she hurries back to their International Scout On the
door of the Scout is a stylized logo of an oil derrick
under which are the words

NORTHLAND PETROLEUM CORP
Anne Marie opens the hatchback and grabs a video camera
ANGLE ON ERIC AND THE WOLF

Eric smiles as the wolf wobbles tentatively to his feet and
trots unsteadily away Near the treeline the wolf turns
glances back at Eric and then disappears into the forest

NEW ANGLE

Anne Marie is taping the wolfs retreat Looking through
the viewfinder she crosses a gully between a pipeline

piling and a rock formation Eric turns toward her and a
glint of light in the debris at her feet catches his eye

ERIC
Anne Marie Stop

She glances down Something metal is half-buried in the
dead leaves and gravel

ERIC
(continuing)
Dont move

Eric runs over He pokes at the object with a stick With
a SNAP a steel leg trap chomps the stick in half Anne
Marie jumps back Eric brushes the dead leaves on the
ground behind her and she carefully backtracks out of the
gully

ERIC
(continuing)
Goddamn trappers

He angrily rips the trap out of the ground unearthing
several others attached to one another by a long chain

ERIC
(continuing)
Takes nerve laying traplines on
restricted land

Eric slips the scope off the dart rifle and climbs up the
pipeline on foot pegs to the top of an anchoring poINT

3 Using the scope as a telescope he scans up and down the
Haul Road

ANNE MARIE
What are you doing

ERIC
He still might be around I saw
fresh tire tracks coming in

HIS POV - THROUGH SCOPE

The road and the pipeline stretch toward either horizon
north and south In the distance a jeep is parked on the
Haul Road Near it a Man climbs down into another shallow
ravine

BACK TO SCENE
Eric hurries down the footpegs

ERIC
Man and a jeep about a mile and
a half down

He jumps into the Scout Anne Marie stuffs her cameras into
the hatchback As soon as she climbs in Eric tears out

4 INT SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
It races along the dusty gravel road at 60 MPH
5 EXT HAUL ROAD

Startled at the APPROACH of the Scout the Trapper uproots
his traps and runs out of the ravine He WHISTLES and
another Trapper appears nearby

6 INT TRAPPERS JEEP

They pile into their dilapidated all-terrain jeep Its
oddly well-equipped however Bolted to the dashboard is an
expensive tape player and a beat-up radio beacon receiver
with a round locating screen They zoom off

7 INT SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
Eric stomps on the gas The dust from the jeep obscures his

view but hes gaining on them anyway Anne Marie hangs on
and squints her eyes against the choking dust

8 INT TRAPPERS JEEP - (MOVING SHOT)

The driver is LEMALLE a tall ugly rawboned Canadian
His entire outfit is made of animal hide He has long red
hair and a reptilian face usually twisted into a sadistic
sneer While driving he scans along the pipeline

LEMALLE
Where the fuck did you drop
Corbett off

In the passenger seat MITCHELL chews tobacco and
looks grim Hes a squat flat-faced Okie with curly
matted hair and tired grey eyes Hes dressed in a brown
long coat and has a Colt 45 Peacemaker in a quick-draw
holster strapped to his leg Despite his intimidating air
confrontation is not his style

He spots a figure up ahead where the road crosses a muddy
creek

MITCHELL
Hes over there

9 EXT HAUL ROAD

Turning sharply the trappers jeep splashes through the
creek bed without slowing Bouncing it comes down hard
against the axle-deep bank at the creeks high water mark
LeMalle tries to back out but cant find traction in the
mud

Eric stops the Scout thirty yards behind them

10 INT SCOUT

Eric opens his door To Anne Marie

ERIC
Stay here

ANNE MARIE
Be careful -- therere two of
them

Eric reaches in the back seat and hands something to Anne
Marie

ERIC
If I unzip my parka stick this
out the window

11 EXT HAUL ROAD
Eric confidently approaches the jeep

Then a third trapper climbs from the creek Hes got a
line of traps slung around his neck and a world of
experience on his face Hes BEN CORBETT a life-long
huntsman somewhere past forty weathered beyond his years

He has a feral nose thick beard and dark smart hunters
eyes He wears a hooded cotton sweat shirt cotton
coveralls and vapor-barrier mountain boots On his belt is
a holster rig cradling a 44 magnum revolver

Eric slows down He didnt expect to face anyone as
formidable as Corbett

12 INT EXT JEEP

Emboldened by Corbetts presence LeMalle reaches into the
back seat and grabs his 65 by 55 Swedish military carbine

CORBETT
(to LeMalle)
No shooting Lets see whos so
interested in us

Corbett has an incongruously affable voice He throws his
traps into the jeep then strides closer toward Eric

MITCHELL

(to Corbett)
Aint worth it Ben

13 EXT HAUL ROAD - CREEK CROSSING - LONG SHOT

As Corbett comes closer Eric realizes this might notve
been a great idea Corbett squints his eyes and sniffs the
air as if by this he can gauge his opponents mettle

ERIC
You got two counts against you --
trapping out of season and
poaching on restricted land

CORBETT
Cant be much of a crime if all
they got minding the area is a
cocky kid

ERIC
I got your plate number asshole
Maybe you feel like spending a
few months in jail

Corbett just smiles

But LeMalle rankled sticks the carbine out the jeep
window

Seeing the rifle pointed at him Eric freezes then slowly
unzips his parka

LEMALLE
Ben Sure you dont want me to
drop the fucker

Corbett doesnt answer Then is eyes narrow and he looks
past Eric at the Scout

CORBETTS POV

The passenger in the Scout sticks what looks like another
rifle out the window

BACK TO SCENE

Eric quickly glances over his shoulder to make sure Anne
Maries backing him up

ERIC
You leave and dont come back
thats the end of it

After a long moment Corbett smiles again then turns away
from Eric He motions LeMalle to the front of the jeep

Frustrated LeMalle slams back the safety on the carbine and
throws it in the back seat

ANGLE ON TRAPPERS

Mitchell climbs into the jeep and starts the engine

LeMalle and Corbett rock the jeep back and forth in the rut
While pushing Corbett rips the sole of his boot on a sharp
piece of granite He cusses and pushes harder

14 EXT HAUL ROAD - CREEK CROSSING

Eric walks back to the Scout He feels the trappers eyes
on his back but forces himself not to hurry

The trappers free their vehicle Corbett gets in the
drivers seat and they take off

15 INT SCOUT

Anne Maries hands are shaking as she pulls the plastic

tranquilizer rifle back in the window

ANNE MARIE
(unnerved)
Great idea -- pointing a lousy
dart gun at some nut with a
high-powered hunting rifle

ERIC
Bastards took off though didnt
they

16 EXT BOREAL FOREST - LATER THAT DAY

The trappers have left the flatlands of the Haul Road area
Now their jeep climbs a pathway over the rolling foothills

17 INT TRAPPERS JEEP - (MOVING SHOT)

Corbett broods while driving Mitchell looks out the
window The silence makes LeMalle uncomfortable

LEMALLE
All this fuckin land and were
locked out Makes me puke

CORBETT
Jawing about it wont change it

LEMALLE
Three hundred seventy-five
million acres in this state Im
real tired of runnin into
people

MITCHELL
Then dont look to your left

18 EXT SPORTSMENS CAMP

A brand-new Land Rover is parked on an alluvial fan ina
bend in a small river Scattered about is an assortment of
expensive camping gear beer cans spent shells and other
garbage

Three toy-macho vacationing SPORTSMEN are guzzling beer and
BLASTING fish in the shallow river with 12-gauge shotguns
They look up and glower suspiciously as the jeep slows and
stops

19 INT TRAPPERS JEEP
LeMalle grabs his carbine

CORBETT
Leave it here

MITCHELL
Lets keep going Were only an
hour from Devils Cauldron

CORBETT
(pats Mitchells shoulder)
Relax I just want to ask them
how the hunting is

20 EXT SPORTSMENS CAMP

Corbett gets out of the jeep He regards the Sportsmen
their shotguns and their mess with ill-concealed contempt

The Sportsmen clutch their weapons and watch Corbett He
walks around the camp spotting a rubber-lined rucksack
stuffed with dead ermine After a long tense moment
Corbett smiles

CORBETT
Looks like youve had some luck
Wheres your guide

SPORTSMAN 1
Were on our own if its any of
your damn business

CORBETT
(re ermine)
You did real good

He crouches next to the dead animals and strokes the fur

LEMALLE
(to Corbett)
No swinging shit Theyre over
their goddamned limit

CORBETT
(to Sportsmen)
My friend is right Supposed to
have a licensed guide when youre
on this land too

SPORTSMAN 1
Hey we paid our fuckin permit
fees
LeMalle amuses himself by pissing in their campfire No one

notices that in the bg
parka exposing a

quiet Sportsman 3 unzips his

-45 Peacemaker in a belt holster

SPORTSMAN 2

I were you Id drive right on
outta here again Now

CORBETT

(calmly)

This was my roaming land ‘til
the government took it over
Only Innuit can hunt here now
and tourists like you

Corbett swings the rucksack of carcasses onto the hood of

the Land Rover
him

Pissed

Sportsmen 1 and 2 step closer to

CORBETT

(continuing)

According to tribal law hunters
passing through the land of
another tribe can only take game
to survive They can eat the
meat but have to surrender the
hides

LeMalle pulls a hunting knife and holds up one of the

ermine

LEMALLE

Want the meat

SPORTSMAN 1

Fuck you dirtball

Corbett chuckles and Mitchell spits

WIDER

LeMalle digs through the camping goodies in the back of the
Land Rover many still in their packages He helps himself
to some sandwiches and a 12-pack of beer

LEMALLE

I say shoot em bury ‘em with
their shiny new car

MITCHELL

(to LeMalle)

If youre gonna take something
take it and lets go

Corbett looks down to fasten the top of the rucksack

20 NEW ANGLE

Suddenly Sportsman 3 reaches inside his parka and pulls
the pistol He swings it toward LeMalle

LeMalle looks up when he hears the HAMMER cock
There is a deafeningly loud SHOT
Sportsman 3 falls down dead at LeMalles feet

Off to one side Corbett holds a huge smoking 44 magnum
six-shooter in his hand

Shotgun in hand Sportsman 1 gauges his chances of blasting
Corbett Nil When Corbett turns to him he lies the
weapon down Sportsman 2 rushes to his friend

Looking bleak Mitchell spits again Corbett crosses to
LeMalle and knocks from his hands the things he wanted to
steal Chastised LeMalle smolders After a moment

CORBETT

(to Sportsmen)

Put him in your truck Smell of
blood will attract the bears
(to trappers)

Lets go

As Corbett walks to the jeep hes too angry to notice that
hes stepped in a patch of mud under the Land Rover

Near the jeep LeMalle stops and pulls them into a huddle
LEMALLE

I dont believe in leavin
witnesses behind Ben

MITCHELL
It was self defense Leave it at
that

LEMALLE

You think those fucks will tell
it that way

CORBETT
(ending the argument)
Well get a head start before
they go crying to the law

Corbett turns and FIRES two rounds from his 44 into the
engine of the Land Rover The Sportsmen stare and sputter

20 CORBETT
(continuing to Sportsmen)
You can pack out of here -- two

three days hike along this river
at most Weather should hold
this early in the season

Corbett and Mitchell get in their jeep

LEMALLE

isnt yet satisfied He walks back over to the Sportsmen
kneeling beside their fallen friend and crouches right
beside them Intimidated Sportsman 2 looks away but
LeMalle grabs his chin and turns his face back toward him

LEMALLE
Think Im pretty You better
forget how we look cause next
time they wont keep me from
killing you This land aint
quite civilized you know

He unsheathes his buck knife BELOW FRAME he slices across
the forehead of the dead Sportsman peels back his scalp and
cuts it loose Indian-style The Sportsmen are stunned and
sickened

ANGLE ON TRAPPERS JEEP
Corbett looks at Mitchell and wearily shakes his head

MITCHELL
At least he scalped the dead one

21 EXT DEVILS CAULDRON - DUSK

Devils Cauldron Hot Springs is a cluster of twenty tiny
dwellings connected by an unpainted boardwalk The town
squats ugly and temporary-looking in a dirt clearing fifty
miles north of the Arctic Circle Thirty miles east of the
Pipeline its almost dead center of interior Alaska

At the edge of town is a gravel airstrip Mixed with the
prospector-era sod-roof cabins are a few prefabricated
houses The boon brought by men building the pipeline is

long gone Now only a few itinerant loggers natives and
bush dwellers remain to fight boredom each other and the
depression of the oncoming winter

Enough steam escapes from the hot springs to perpetually
blanket the valley with fog The spa is log-walled and
horseshoe- shaped with partitioned baths inside Facing it

are a mud-walled fire bath a wooden steam bath called a
Maqi six one-room cabins for let and an unused dance hall

LEO MEYERLING opens the tailgate of a Dodge truck with the
Northland Petroleum logo and District Supervisor on the
door Meyerling is short and bald with a completely
disreputable face He staples a poster on a wall It has a
picture of him on it and

LEO MEYERLING
for
State Legislature
VOTE FOR THE PEOPLES FRIEND

22 EXT KENAIS GENERAL STORE

Corbett and the other trappers drive past Meyerling and park
their jeep as the sun disappears behind the foothills

23 INT KENAIS GENERAL STORE

A handwritten public notice next to a schedule of church
meetings reads Live each day so you can look every damn
man in the eye and tell him to go to hell There is a post
office in the corner with some combination boxes and a
wicketless window

The trappers come in Corbett sits in a chair and pulls his
boots off One of his wool socks is wet He nods to the
man sitting in the other chair SAM WILDER Wilder is short
and tough with a full head of crewcut grey hair and
weather- ravaged face that makes him look older than his
sixty years

CORBETT
Hullo Sam Slow day

WILDER
(wary)
Benboys Yeah real slow and
Id like to keep it that way

CORBETT
(conciliatory)
Just passing through

A chubby Inupiat (interior Eskimo) wearing thick glasses
several heavy sweaters and battery-heated socks fusses
behind the counter Hes EARL KENAI owner of the hot
springs spa and the general store

LeMalle chews on a handful of bear jerky Kenai stares at
LeMalle until he begrudgingly pays for the jerky Corbett
pulls on some sneakers and hands his boots to Kenai

CORBETT
(continuing re boot)
Needs patching

KENAI
Twenty-five dollar

CORBETT
(smiles)
Sure have learned to worship the
white mans god

Kenai nods agreeably and holds his hand out Corbett pays
him Meyerling comes in and posts some fliers on the
corkboard

MEYERLING
I hope I can count on you
gentlemen to vote for The
Peoples Friend this November

CORBETT
Share some of that oil company
money in your pocket and you can

Meyerling smiles like a toad then slaps another poster on
the wall LeMalle throws his knife and it STICKS in the
poster between Meyerlings spread fingers Meyerling jumps
back and the trappers laugh Meyerling looks to Wilder for
support

WILDER
(to Meyerling)
One flier comes loose and I shoot
you for littering

MEYERLING
(exiting grudgeless)
Have your fun just remember
The Peoples Friend come election
day

WILDER

(shakes his head)

Oil Company candidate running on
that slogan makes about as much
sense as a rat fucking a
grapefruit

CORBETT
Hard to work up an interest in
politics way we live Youre
the first people weve seen in
two weeks

23 LEMALLE
(to Kenai)
How about a quart of Jack
Daniels

KENAI
How about it is right Back in
the primary this town was voted
dry

LEMALLE
(to Corbett)
Aw shit Lets go Leave a
note for Viking Bob tell him to
meet us in Cache

CORBETT
Relax One more day without
drink wont kill you Right
Sam

WILDER
Im living proof of that sad
fact

CORBETT
Can we buy the Marshal some
dinner

WILDER
No I better stay at my post

Even without the hootch riling
em up you know how
mean-spirited folks get when they
smell winter coming

24 EXT DEVILS CAULDRON VALLEY - LONG SHOT - NIGHT

An early STORM has blown in from the north bringing
whipping winds and freezing rain
25 INT RENTAL CABIN

Corbett peers out the tiny window

frowning LeMalle cleans

his carbine while eating beans and bacon Mitchell hunches
over a table Hes making a scrimshaw -- delicately
engraving using homemade tools on a palm-sized piece of
whale bone He rubs his eyes and looks up at Corbett

MITCHELL

So much for the walking weather
you predicted

CORBETT

Had no choice

(pointedly
Given the

I know Lea
all of them

at LeMalle)

situation

MITCHELL
st you didnt shoot

LEMALLE

Fuck you Mitchell Woulda been
my ass if Ben didnt waste that

prick

CORBETT

(after a beat)
Mitchell look it dont take
three of us to wait for Viking

Bob

Mitchell glances at LeMalle then at Corbett

(continuing)

CORBETT

Go ahead Take the jeep Ill
come to Cache with Bob when he

gets here

Okay by me

MITCHELL
Youre the one likes

these hot springs so much

CORBETT

Leave my traps Well tag up

couple days

26 EXT HAUL ROAD - THE TURTLE

- DAY

The winds have died down The rain has turned to a light

snow

A mobile arctic dwelling sits on a rise next to the Haul
Road Its a double-unit weathertight cocoon of fiberglass
and aluminum pulled by a diesel rig on oversized tires
The front module is 12 by 24 the rear 12 by 18

An extended-cab pickup pulls up and Sam Wilder gets out
The gravel-and-dirt Haul Road paralleling the pipeline for
400 miles is closed to the public An arriving vehicle
therefore is news The front door of the dwelling opens
Eric and Anne Marie come outside delighted to see Wilder

WILDER
I was making my rounds saw your
hangar wide open plane getting
rained on so I closed it up

ERIC
Thanks

ANNE MARIE
(to Wilder)
I bet you havent had lunch

WILDER
(smiles)
Bet youre right But I didnt
come by to wangle a meal --

ERIC
-- We appreciate the company
Anne Maries getting cabin fever
already

Anne Marie shoots a look at Eric but doesnt disagree --
this is obviously an issue with them Wilder looks with
amusement at the mobile dwelling

WILDER
Whatd you say they call these
spaceships
ERIC
Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD
ANNE MARIE

I call it the Turtle as in
carrying your home on your back

ERIC
Best thing is Meyerling has to
chase around to find us

ANNE MARIE
(laughs)
The little creep hates it that
Eric actually does what the
company hired him to do

WILDER
Watch it with Meyerling Mans
as mean and corrupt as they get
Cut his mothers throat if itd
get him a couple votes

26 Looking past Wilder Eric points out some smoke on the
horizon

ERIC
Hey Sam look over there Black
and white smoke

WILDER
Damn Likely thats an SOS
Have to pass on that lunch

ERIC
Well go with you

CUT TO
27 EXT SPORTSMENS CAMP - LATER THAT DAY

Everything seems peaceful enough The SOS fire (made from
burning green branches for white smoke and rubber for black
smoke) has burnt down to embers

Eric Anne Marie and Wilder pull up in Wilders pickup

The two Sportsmen sit in the front seat of the Land Rover
but they dont react to the arrival of the rescuers In the
back seat a reflective camping blanket covers a large mass

Something is amiss Eric shoots a look of trepidation at
Anne Marie as they get out of the pickup Wilder pulls the
door of the Land Rover open

A Sportsman slumps out onto the ground His eyes are open
and his tongue pokes out between his lips His skin is
blue-white (He looks in fact much like Erics nightmare)

Startled Eric steps back Anne Marie gasps with horror
Wilder unzips the Sportsmans light windbreaker and listens

for a heartbeat Nothing

WILDER
Stupid goddamn greenhorns

to death

They got wet in the rain
body temperature dropped got
drowsy probably didnt even know
what was happening

Eric stares at the dead Sportsmen

(continuing)

Question is why they sat here
when the storm moved in
their stuff while I sniff around

Wilder tries the ignition The starter TURNS OVER but the
He walks to the front
of the vehicle Noticing the bullet holes in the grille

engine makes a horrendous GRINDING
bends down for a closer look

NEW ANGLE

Eric opens the rear hatchback and digs through the plentiful
supplies Still in their packages are some matchbox-sized

ELT locating beacons

They had Emergency Locater
Transmitters

them

(opens one up
head)
Maybe because they didnt bring

batteries

CLOSE

Anne Marie opens the back door of the Land Rover
back the camping blanket and uncovers the third
Sportsman The torn red flesh on his head and his
bugged-out eyes are a hideous sight

Anne Marie SCREAMS and stumbles away

28 EXT SPORTSMENS CAMP - LAND ROVER

Eric runs over to her as she tries to catch her breath

ANNE MARIE
Its not even winter

but didnt use

shakes his

Wilder looks at the third Sportsman and angrily kicks the
side of the Land Rover

WILDER
Im too old for this shit

ERIC
Any idea who couldve done it

Sourly Wilder points to a patch of frozen mud under the
vehicle

WILDER
A certain sonofabitch bastard
-more-

WILDER (Contd)
wearing a damaged mountain boot
Left a footprint clear as an
autograph

Wilder examines the Sportsman finding the bullet hole in
his chest

WILDER
(continuing)
Even for Ben Corbett this is
nasty Mans got balls He was
sitting in Devils Cauldron when
I left calm as can be

ANNE MARIE
Thank God You can arrest him

WILDER
Not necessarily Corbetts awful
hardbitten these days

Wilder leans against the Land Rover feeling tired

WILDER
(continuing)
His old roaming areas all
private reserve now Normally
long as he stays civil in my
jurisdiction I let him be
(beat)
Wont be able to take him by my
lonesome though Nobody in
townll lift a finger on this

Eric looks hard at the dead Sportsmen

ERIC
(quietly)
Ill go into town with you

ANNE MARIE
Eric leave it alone Its not
your business

ERIC
(shakes his head)
No way can he get away with this
Ill be back by tonight

29 EXT DEVILS CAULDRON - AFTERNOON

The town is quiet

30 INT HOT SPRINGS SPA

Corbett soaks in one of the huge wooden tubs with a pudgy
Inupiat hooker DIXIE

He looks up as Eric comes into the spa Eric holds
Corbetts boots which have been repaired Eric pauses when
he sees Corbett There is a flash of recognition between
them

ERIC
Ben Corbett

CORBETT
Yep Afraid you have me at a
disadvantage

ERIC

Kenai at the general store asked
me to bring these Didnt expect
wed already met

CORBETT
No big deal We just got off on
the wrong foot Whats your
name

Eric glances down at Corbetts duffel bag which sits on the
floor next to Corbetts tub Corbetts magnum rests on top
of it well within reach Corbett notices Erics interest
in it He leans back and smiles

ERIC
Desmond

CORBETT
New to the country kid
ERIC

CORBETT

Putting his hand on Dixies shoulder Corbett stands
gets out of the tub His sinewy body resembling a

scarecrow made of steel cable is covered with scars

wraps a towel around his waist and crosses to Eric

CORBETT
(continuing)
Now why dont you get around
saying what you want

Corbett grabs his boots from Eric and finds himself facing a

revolver which Eric has been hiding inside one of t
boots

CORBETT
(continuing smiling)

You wouldnt shoot anyone

WILDER (OS)
But I would

NEW ANGLE

Wilder has come in the back way and stands behind Co

with a 12-gauge shotgun He kicks Corbetts magnum out of

reach

CORBETT
All this for laying traps on
private land

WILDER
You left a footprint at the
Sportsmens camp Only prett

31 EXT HOT SPRINGS SPA

Eric comes outside Earl Kenai overdressed for the weather
in gloves mukluks and a full-length sealskin coat stands

shivering by a woodshed near the hot springs hacksawing a
piece of meat from a frozen moose carcass

KENAI
Before white men came my people
lived in sod houses underground
and laid our dead on the tundra
Now we live above ground and bury
our dead and we havent been
warm since

Wilder comes out of the spa with his shotgun and Corbetts
duffel bag cradled in his arm Handcuffed Corbett walks in
front of him

Kenai looks down to avoid eye contact with Corbett as he
goes by Corbett stops next to Eric and smiles

CORBETT
Nice bluff the other day with the
tranquilizer gun out your jeep
window See you again maybe

ERIC
(unintimidated)
Yeah Maybe so

32 EXT DEVILS CAULDRON - FOLLOW WILDER

as he leads Corbett along the boardwalk to the other end of
town They approach a prefab house perched on skids under a
tall antenna tower Mounted above the shack a DC wind
charger turbine spins lazily in the faint breeze From
within the cabin comes an anomalous SOUND -- MTV Wilder
KNOCKS on the door

ARTHUR NEFF a pasty-white 45-year-old ex-Texan pulls the
door open His customary grin fades when he sees Corbett

33 INT NEFFS HOUSE
Wilder pushes Corbett inside past Neff

WILDER
I need to call Fairbanks

Neff just stares at Corbett

WILDER
(continuing)
Neff Dial it up State police

With a what can I do but oblige look to Corbett Neff
sits in front of the RCA Alascom radio telephone and dials

NEFF
(on phone)
Fairbanks Alascom Patch me
through to the State Police

After a moment he hands the receiver to Wilder Wilder
takes it keeping one eye and the shotgun on Corbett

WILDER
(on phone)

Angry Wilder slams the receiver down
34 INT WILDERS CABIN

In one room there is a wood-burning cookstove and an Ashley
heat stove a table a bunk and a small window Behind a
cloth partition is an eight by six holding cell The frame
of an iron-bar door is securely cemented to the log walls
Wilder comes in with Corbett and locks him in the cell

CORBETT
Mind if I get some stuff from my
kit

Wilder does mind He locks the duffel bag and Corbetts 44
in his desk drawer

CORBETT
(continuing)
Sam listen -- I shot to defend
my man Other guy drew first

WILDER
If that was all fine But
carving him up stranding the
others thats too fucking much
Is everything that walks crawls
flies or swims fair game to you

CORBETT
(softly)
Ill get loose before that plane
comes

WILDER

Dont try me Ill kill you if
it comes to it

The storm has passed A faint CHUGGING emanates from the
small orange generator trailer behind the Turtle Eric
pulls up and parks the Scout

37 INT THE TURTLE

Nylon storage netting along the ceiling holds Erics
research equipment and Anne Maries photographic supplies
In one corner of the Turtle are several of her black and
white prints All are of man-made objects whose presence is
juxtaposed with the natural surroundings

Relieved hes home in one piece Anne Marie meets Eric at
the door and kisses him Carrying a brown-paper-wrapped
package Eric follows her into the kitchen where shes
preparing dinner

ANNE MARIE
Did you catch Corbett

ERIC
Sure did He was one of the
trappers we rousted from the Haul
Road

ANNE MARIE
Was there any trouble

ERIC
He was sitting in a hot tub with
a hooker

ANNE MARIE

Going after killers isnt the
same as chasing poachers Eric

ERIC
(grins)

Perplexed she looks at the return address --
Bloomingdales Delighted she tears it open Inside is
pretty elegant dress Anne Marie kisses him

ANNE MARIE
Oh sweetheart Its beautiful

ERIC
You were looking at it in the

ANNE MARIE

ANNE MARIE

ERIC

ANNE MARIE
Look why get into this again

ERIC

ANNE MARIE
(sighs)

I love you

(kisses him)

So shut up and lets eat

38 EXT DEVILS CAULDRON - NIGHT

An old primer-grey station wagon rattles into town and
parks With an unlit cheroot stuck in his mouth VIKING
BOB CORBETT gets out and stretches Hes 38 six-foot-six
with sandy hair beard ruddy skin and his brothers dark
eyes

He looks around for some sign of life He spots Neff
tending one of the windmills and walks over to him

VIKING BOB
Im looking for some trappers
Ben Corbett Mitchell LeMalle
Seen em

NEFF
Yesterday Said they were going
to Cache They were thirsty but
we were voted dry

VIKING BOB
Shit

As Viking Bob walks back to his station wagon he notices
Kenai poking around in front of Wilders cabin

VIKING BOBS POV

Illuminated by a bare bulb is Wilders typical bush-country
front yard Piled are five cords of wood boxes tarps
stove parts saw horses 55-gallon drums dismantled snow
machines wash tubs tires etc

Bunching his collar around his neck Kenai shivers and sorts
through Corbetts traps

NEW ANGLE
Viking Bob ambles over to Kenai

VIKING BOB
These yours

KENAI
Gonna make an offer Man who
owns them wont need them where
hes going

39 INT WILDERS CABIN

Wilder peers out the window and sees Viking Bob then turns
to Corbett

WILDER
Back against the bars Now

Wilder handcuffs Corbetts hands to the cell door bars then
quickly wraps a piece of duct tape across Corbetts face
covering his mouth

Stuffing a 357 magnum in his belt Wilder coatless slips
outside

As soon as hes out the door Corbett cranes his neck and
painfully tries to pry the tape off his face with the corner
of the door hinge

40 EXT WILDERS CABIN

The look on Wilders face tells Kenai to shut up Viking
Bob realizes somethings up

WILDER
Your brother and the boys left me
some traps to sell for them
Theyre gone --

VIKING BOB
-- To Cache So I heard Ben
never said nothing to me about
selling his gear

41 INT WILDERS CABIN

Corbett gets the tape partially off his mouth He pries one

of his boots off and kicks it through a window

CORBETT
Bob They got me on a murder
charge
42 EXT WILDERS CABIN
Wilder pulls his 357 out
WILDER

Sorry Bob Ill have to keep
you here til I ship him south

Viking Bob responds by flinging a heavy trap at Wilder

punching him in the gut Wilder sprawls among the junk
dropping his revolver Kenai freezes not about to take

sides

then

Before Viking Bob can come at him again Wilder grabs for

his 357 Viking Bob jumps back and bolts for his car

He dives into his station wagon and starts it up As he

drives past Wilder POPS off a few rounds but Viking Bob

keeps going

NEW ANGLE

Kenai helps Wilder up Pissed Wilder shoves him against

the cabin

WILDER
(continuing)
You stupid greedy loudmouth
sonofabitch Hell have the
others here in a few hours You

KENAI
(shakes head)

Forget it Sam I never work for

43 INT THE TURTLE - NIGHT

Anne Marie sits on the floor editing one of her VIDEOTAPES

On the monitor it SHOWS footage of the traps under the

pipeline piling Eric comes out of the back module holding
two ELT pendants He glances over at the monitor and nods

approvingly

ANNE MARIE
I still cant believe Im being
financed by an oil company
Especially when they get a look
at these pictures Technology in
the wilderness not too pretty
(re ELTs)
Whats that

ERIC
I thought I should check our
emergency transmitters

Eric activates the ELTs They emit an SOS pattern of radio
waves -- three short three long and three short This is
visible as rhythmic INTERFERENCE on Anne Maries video
MONITOR

ERIC

(continuing)
Avalanche season is coming

ANNE MARIE
Winter Two straight months of
night -- we may never get out of

bed
(kisses him)
Which would suit me fine

ERIC
Prolonged darkness makes people
crazy

ANNE MARIE

Not me Im equipped

She turns on a small S-VHS video camera and snaps off the
room lights

ANNE MARIE
(continuing)
Allow me to give you a practical
demonstration of low-light
infrared photography

She does so by seductively undressing for the camera Shes
SEEN on the MONITOR illuminated by the light from the hot
stove Eric appreciates the show He crawls toward her

ANNE MARIE
(continuing)
High-tech in the wilderness
Gets me excited too

ERIC
Come here

Laughing he wrestles her to the rug

44 EXT HILLS ABOVE DEVILS CAULDRON - NIGHT

There is a full moon and a clear night sky Viking Bobs
station wagon is parked out of sight He sits inside

waiting

He hears an ENGINE starting in the distance Sitting up he
grabs some binoculars

HIS POV
Wilders extended cab truck pulls out heading west
45 EXT FOOTHILLS - NIGHT

In the bright moonlight two people are seen in Wilders
truck as it speeds along a dirt road

Viking Bob follows at a discreet distance headlights off

NEW ANGLE

Viking Bob turns and takes the literal high road -- a narrow
trail above the roadway that Wilders truck is on

He zooms ahead and gets in front of his quarry then drops
back down onto the road and waits in ambush

As Wilders truck approaches Viking Bob turns on his bright
lights and crouches behind his car door with a shotgun

Wilders truck screeches to a stop

CLOSER

Kenai gets out with his hands up

Viking Bob slowly approaches Wilders truck

VIKING BOB
Ben

No answer Viking Bob looks in the cab Kenais passenger
is Dixie the Inupiat hooker Viking Bob grabs Kenai and

pushes the barrel of the shotgun hard against his cheek

VIKING BOB
(continuing)
Wheres Ben Corbett

KENAI
I have no argument with you Bob
Wilder said I could keep his
truck if I drove it ten miles
away from town

VIKING BOB
Where did they go

KENAI
He didnt say but I would guess
the opposite way from here

Viking Bob shoves Kenai against the truck then punches him
for good measure Cussing he runs back to his station
wagon and drives off

CUT TO
46 INT THE TURTLE - REAR MODULE - NIGHT

Eric and Anne Marie are asleep Eric starts awake at the OS
sound of a high-pitched vehicle HORN and an approaching
ENGINE

47 EXT HAUL ROAD - THE TURTLE

Eric pulls the door open Wilder is untying Corbett from
the snowmobile

WILDER
I got an emergency on my hands

Corbett smiles at Eric as he walks inside
48 INT THE TURTLE

Eric Wilder and Corbett sit in the front module Anne
Marie nervous wearing a down robe serves coffee She
stares at Corbett trying to reconcile his quiet demeanor
with what she saw that afternoon Corbett smiles at Eric

WILDER
(to Eric)

You give us a ride in the
Cessna you got hangared at the
pumping station well be in
Fairbanks in a few hours

ERIC
Thats what we shouldve done in
the first place

WILDER
I couldve sat tight for the
transport til Bob came poking
around

CORBETT
(to Wilder re Anne Marie)
A lot to ask dragging him away
from such a good-looking girl --

ERIC
(irritated)
-- To take you to jail Itll be
my pleasure

WILDER
(to Eric)
You better get some sleep

CORBETT
Good idea Flying over mountains
can give you some nasty
surprises Go too low one of
the clouds might have a big rock
inside it

ERIC

(hard)

Ill get you there all right
Eric takes Anne Marie to the rear module leaving Wilder
with his prisoner

CUT TO

49 INT THE TURTLE - LATER THAT NIGHT

A bottle of Erics Scotch sits almost empty on the table
beside Wilder Wilder dozes in a chair facing Corbett

Corbett is awake He contorts his body to bring his
handcuff chain under his feet and get his hands in front of
him He eyes Wilders 357 Its in a lefty Sam Browne
holster No way to take it without waking Wilder

Corbett stands and inches toward the door As he pulls it
open the insulation makes enough NOISE to stir Wilder

Wilder gets up and pushes Corbett back into his chair
WILDER
Goddammit I dont need this
aggravation Ill shoot you
Ben Bank on it

CORBETT
I dont want to hurt you Sam

WILDER
Im not too old to knock the snot
out of you

CORBETT
Nothing personal

Wilders mind clears enough to realize that Corbetts hands
are in front of him He reaches for his 357 Corbett
butts into Wilders midsection with his head Amazingly
Wilder stays on his feet

Corbett hurries back to the door Wilder lunges
bull-determined to hold onto him Corbett smashes Wilder
across the face with his clenched hands Wilder goes down
hard hitting his head on the table and stays there
Corbett instinctively kneels to see if Wilder is still
breathing But then hearing MOVEMENT in the rear module
Corbett flees

50 INT THE TURTLE - REAR MODULE
Eric is pulling on his pants
51 INT THE TURTLE - FRONT MODULE
Eric rushes in The outside door is open and Wilder lies on
the floor His holster is empty Anne Marie comes in and
crosses to Wilder
Eric pulls a floor trap door open and digs through the
company-issue equipment coming up with a huge Remington
bolt-action bear rifle Unfamiliar with weapons Eric tears
open a box of shells and fumbles to load the rifle
52 EXT THE TURTLE
Corbett is trying to start Erics Scout
Eric fires a loud warning SHOT from the Turtle doorway
ERIC
You want to try that handgun

against this rifle go ahead

Corbett sits in the Scout for a long moment weighing his
odds He takes his hands off the steering wheel

Eric SHOOTS again this time SMASHING the side-view mirror
and window next to Corbetts head

Still handcuffed Corbett gets out of the Scout Holding
the 357 gingerly by the butt he puts it on the hood of the
Scout

CORBETT
Some day you might have to face
me without a gun

53 INT THE TURTLE

Eric leads Corbett in Anne Marie is cradling Wilders
head Shes crying Eric looks at Wilder There is blood
coming from his ear and hes fading fast

WILDER
(thickly)

Fetch him back

(Eric nods)

Dont let him walk

Eric nods again Wilder holds his gaze on Eric then simply
stops breathing

Eric is stunned Quietly Corbett sits down Clutching the
rifle Eric sits on the floor and glares at Corbett

CORBETT
(softly)
Does he have people

ERIC
(after a beat)
A daughter in Oregon

CORBETT
Send him down to her Theres
money in my duffel bag back at
his cabin

Corbetts benign attitude is chilling

ERIC
I better call in

He turns the shortwave radio on It SPARKS and burns out
The remainder of the liquor has been poured inside it

ERIC
(continuing)
Thought of everything huh

CORBETT
Surviving is what I know --

ERIC
-- Killing is what you know
(to Anne Marie)
Pack some food while I prep for
the flight
(off her look)
Im sure not gonna let him go

Covering Corbett with the rifle Eric handcuffs him to the
sturdy metal bracket of a wall unit

54 EXT CACHE ALASKA - (MOVING SHOT) - NIGHT
Viking Bob approaches in his station wagon on a narrow dirt

road The huge night sky all but smothers the weak light
from the town up ahead

Cache seems a mistake -- a jumble of unpainted buildings in
the middle of a big nothing twenty miles north of the
Arctic Circle Still its more animated than Devils
Cauldron There are a hundred permanent residents several
taverns and a three-store fly-in shopping center

Even though its the middle of the night people roam the
streets drinking and socializing With only a couple feet
of snow on the ground this is still summertime Under
storefront awnings drunken INDIANS sleep on the concrete

Viking Bob cruises the main drag looking for the other
trappers He spots their jeep in front of a
dangerous-looking saloon called the Bear Sign Inn

ANGLE WITH VIKING BOB

as he parks and gets out of his station wagon He hears a
familiar VOICE around the side of the building

LEMALLE (OS)
Cmon girl talk to me
negotiate with me

55 EXT CACHE - ALLEY
Drunk LeMalle stands in an alley with a bored acne-scarred

Oriental PROSTITUTE He weaves and leers his hand stuck
inside her blouse
VIKING BOB
LeMalle We got a problem
Wheres Mitchell

LEMALLE
Goddamn Viking Bob Mitchells
inside boring bastard

Grumbling Viking Bob separates LeMalle from the Prostitute
and drags him by the collar out of the alley

CUT TO
56 INT BEAR SIGN INN - NIGHT
Meyerlings campaign posters cover the walls Many have
been pulled down and muddied underfoot by the drunken crowd
In a booth covered with grafitti Mitchell squints and works
on his scrimshaw LeMalle somewhat sober eats a plate of
muktuk -- whale blubber Viking Bob pours him more coffee
MITCHELL
(to Viking Bob)
Ben never sent a signal
VIKING BOB
Musta never got a chance to

VIKING BOB (Contd)
activate Wilders aiming to
take him to Fairbanks we can
count on that much

MITCHELL
Meaning hell need a plane

VIKING BOB
Closest planes for hire are here
in Cache

MITCHELL
Hang on

(to LeMalle)

Remember that Cessna we saw at
the pumping station on the Haul
Road Belongs to the guy they
got patrolling the pipeline

LEMALLE
There you go Wilders always
chummy with the fuckin
Bambi-lovers

VIKING BOB
Its a long shot

MITCHELL
You got a better idea

57 EXT HAUL ROAD - THE TURTLE - DAWN
Wisps of light cut across the cold blue sky

Eric comes out of the Turtle leaving the front door ajar
He throws a knapsack of supplies into the back of the Scout

58 INT THE TURTLE

Corbetts right hand is still handcuffed to the wall unit
Terrified about being alone with Corbett Anne Marie
cautiously puts a cup of coffee in front of him

CORBETT
How long have you been up north

ANNE MARIE
(after a beat)
Six months

CORBETT
Cant be Too keen a sense of
this place in your pictures

ANNE MARIE
Six months this time I was born
in the Aleutians

CORBETT
Your people Alaskan

Anne Marie doesnt want to talk to a killer but Corbett is
so soft-spoken and charming that she answers despite
herself

ANNE MARIE
My dad was a Navy doctor

CORBETT
Knew you had no native blood

eyes give you away My wife had
blue eyes

Anne Marie shudders

around

ANNE MARIE

Sunday morning she marched into
a bar and announced she was

(off Anne Maries amazed
look)
My bid was eight thousand
dollars Beautiful girl

ANNE MARIE
How did she

CORBETT
I was gone in September laying
traplines She went to our cache
for some meat Got mauled by a
bear Tore open her skull
-more-

CORBETT (Contd)
Mightve lived if she got help
but the exposed part of her brain
froze

Smiling good-naturedly Corbett looks

spotting the package Anne Maries new dress came in

CORBETT
(continuing)

What about you -- why come back
Classy girl like you seems more
suited to the finer things

ANNE MARIE
Thats why I left moved to
Washington When I met Eric I
was doing day shoots -- products

and fashion mostly Pretty
dull Eric was teaching college
and then he got the job with
Northland Oil We wanted to stay
together so we talked them into
funding some wilderness
photography and here I am

As shes talking the Turtle ROCKS slightly She looks out
the tiny window

HER POV - THROUGH WINDOW

Eric is putting Wilders body inside an enclosed storage
compartment built flush into the side of the Turtle

BACK TO SCENE
Horrified Anne Marie turns away

CORBETT
You should know something

ANNE MARIE
I dont want to talk any more

CORBETT
Wasnt my intention to hurt
Wilder Im telling you the
truth I liked the man I only
meant to get loose to survive
Your cheechako boyfriend better
understand that
(beat)
Listen Ive got some money put
away --

58 ANNE MARIE
-- Dont ever think you can buy
Eric off Mr Corbett --

ERIC (OS)
-- Cheechako

Eric comes in none too thrilled about Anne Marie chatting
with Corbett

ANNE MARIE
(translating)
Outsider

He carefully stuffs Wilders magnum in his belt and ignores
Anne Maries disparaging look as he does

ERIC
(to Corbett)
Lets go

ANNE MARIE
Wait a second

59 INT THE TURTLE - REAR MODULE

Anne Marie leads Eric out of earshot from Corbett Eric
keeps a cautious eye on him

ANNE MARIE
Maybe you should drive him into
Devils Cauldron let them decide
what to do with him

ERIC
(reassuringly)
Fairbanks is a three-hour flight
Ill be back by dinnertime

Realizing hes determined she sighs and kisses him
ERIC
(continuing)

Be careful okay

ANNE MARIE
Thats my line

60 EXT HAUL ROAD and FELDSPAR CREEK - DAWN

Eric and Corbett drive toward the deserted pumping station
They cross over a prefabricated steel portal bridge spanning
a fast-running creek

61 INT SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)

The wind whips through the shot-out wing window Corbetts
handcuffs are lashed to the seat frame with sturdy nylon
rope

62 EXT PUMPING STATION

The pumping station consists of three corrugated steel
buildings The largest is an airplane hangar

Just beyond the hangar is a narrow blacktop landing strip
running parallel to the Haul Road

CUT TO
63 INT SCOUT - ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW - (MOVING SHOT)

Eric pulls up to the hangar Suddenly LeMalle steps out
from behind the building

64 EXT PUMPING STATION

LeMalle recognizes the International Scout He swings his
rifle up to stop it

Eric slams it in reverse and SCREECHES back around the
hangar

MITCHELL (OS)
Aim for the tires

LeMalle FIRES as the Scout rounds the corner He hits a
fender doing no damage Angry he runs after the vehicle

65 INT SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
Eric slams on the brakes and turns the Scout around
CORBETT
Let me out and keep going They
catch us theyll kill you
Eric doesnt need any convincing of that He tears out
66 EXT PUMPING STATION
Mitchell runs out in front of them and BLASTS the front of
the Scout with his 45 Peacemaker Steam HISSES out of the
radiator Eric floors it and races past Mitchell almost
hitting him

Mitchell and LeMalle SHOOT at the retreating vehicle One
of the Scouts back tires gets blown out

67 INT SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)

Eric slows shifts into four-wheel drive and continues
driving on the rim

68 EXT PUMPING STATION

Chewing an unlit cheroot Viking Bob pulls up next to
Mitchell and LeMalle in the trappers jeep They pile in

69 EXT HAUL ROAD

Eric backtracks as fast as possible in the crippled vehicle

70 INT TRAPPERS JEEP - THROUGH WINDSHIELD - (MOVING SHOT)

As the Scout heads for the Feldspar Creek bridge it
disappears from sight over a hill

71 EXT HAUL ROAD and FELDSPAR CREEK

Viking Bob zooms over Feldspar Creek They come over the
rise but the Scout still cant be seen ahead of them

REVERSE ANGLE

The Scout sits idling in a depression near the creek bed
below the Haul Road Above the trappers speed past without
noticing

After giving the trappers time to get around the next bend
Eric drives the Scout up the embankment and crosses back
over the bridge

72 INT SCOUT

Eric stops the vehicle He grabs a five-gallon gas can and
a piece of cloth from the back

73 EXT HAUL ROAD and FELDSPAR CREEK

The prefab bridge is the transportable type used by the Army
Corps of Engineers left over from the building of the
pipeline Eric stuffs the gas can between the abutment and
the honeycombed underside of the bridge He puts the rag
inside the spout of the can lights it with a match and runs
like hell back to the Scout

74 EXT HAUL ROAD

The trappers realize their quarry is missing Viking Bob
slams on the brakes and looks around

75 INT SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)
Eric speeds away

CORBETT
Theyll still catch us All
youre doing is pissing them off

76 EXT HAUL ROAD and FELDSPAR CREEK

The gasoline can EXPLODES tearing the bridge couplings away
from the concrete abutment

77 EXT HAUL ROAD
The trappers see the explosion behind them They turn
around and head toward it

78 EXT PUMPING STATION - HANGAR

Eric parks the Scout sideways to block the way to the
airstrip

With the magnum at the ready Eric cuts Corbetts handcuffs
loose from the seat and hurries him toward the hangar

The leeward side of the structure is a huge metal door on
rollers Eric unlocks it and rolls it back Inside is a
Cessna 182 dusted with snow and ice blown through the
cracks by crosswinds Eric brushes the windshield with his
sleeve

719 EXT HAUL ROAD and FELDSPAR CREEK

The trappers pull up and find the far side of the bridge
burning and disconnected from the creek bank

80 INT HANGAR - CESSNA

Eric helps Corbett into the cockpit then secures his
handcuffs to the frame of the seat with more nylon rope

81 EXT HAUL ROAD and FELDSPAR CREEK

Viking Bob assesses the damage to the bridge Loose from
the abutments it wobbles like a diving board Below the
water is too deep and fast-moving to be traversable

82 INT HANGAR - CESSNA

Eric tries to turn the ENGINE over The starter is sluggish
from cold and lack of use

83 EXT HAUL ROAD and FELDSPAR CREEK

Viking Bob looks at the others bursting with frustration
He climbs into the drivers seat

VIKING BOB
Get in We can jump it

They hop in He SCREECHES backwards to get a running start
REVS the engine pops the clutch and tears toward the
bridge

As they reach the midpoint of the bridge it begins to buckle
under them With a sickening WRENCHING the crossbar
supports crumple
The jeep flies through the still-burning gasoline becomes
airborne and SCRAPES to a rude stop on the edge of the
pavement on the other side the back wheels dangling in
space

LeMalle and Mitchell gingerly get out and push the ass end
of the jeep onto solid earth

84 INT HANGAR

Eric finally STARTS the plane and taxis out onto the landing
strip

85 EXT PUMPING STATION

The trappers drive up to where the Scout blocks their path
They pile out of their jeep and run toward the landing
strip

86 INT CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)

It picks up speed and takes off

ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW - (AERIAL SHOT)

Below the trappers watch the plane zoom over their heads
LeMalle points his carbine at it but Viking Bob pushes the
rifle down

87 INT CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)

Corbett scowls as he sees the trappers helpless below him

88 EXT PUMPING STATION

Viking Bob watches wide-eyed with fury Mitchell spits
LeMalle punches the wall Then he turns and repeatedly
BLASTS the Scout parked nearby with his carbine

89 INT CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)

Erics knapsack an emergency kit and several five-gallon
cans of aviation fuel are tucked behind the seats

ERIC
How the hell were they smart
enough to find us

CORBETT
Smart Sure Thats why Im
sitting in this plane and theyre
down there blowing me kisses

Eric retracts the landing gear and banks toward the
southwest Corbett notices that Eric seems a little unsure
of the controls

CORBETT
(continuing)
Been driving long

ERIC
I needed a pilots license to
take the job here so I got one
in six weeks

CORBETT
That makes the flight more
interesting

Eric ignores the jibe He stays at 2000 feet making the
landscape all the more immediate

Corbett stares out the window and broods He spots an open
snow-covered area where some dark blotches mar the
whiteness

CORBETT
(continuing)
See the blood Pack of wolves
took down a moose Greedy
gut-ripping sons of bitches Id
kill the last wolf on earth
right in front of the President
of the US Stinking cowardly
predator the wolf

ERIC
Sounds like professional
jealousy

CORBETT

Hunting and trapping was a damn
fine life

(beat)

Me and Mitchell Bob and LeMalle
we were teams Id always go
with Mitchell Good man
Mitchell Id let Bob worry
about goddamn LeMalle Wed hire
a plane in October On the way
to a dirt airstrip somewhere
wed drop supplies Wed land
tell the pilot to come back for
us a few days before Christmas

ANOTHER ANGLE - (AERIAL SHOT)

While talking in an even tone Corbett intently studies the
instrument panel and scans the landscape below

CORBETT
The idea was to get to the
supplies before the bears did
Along the route wed set our
traps Made our years living in
three months

Corbett spots a flat plateau farther in the mountains above
the tree line

CORBETT
(continuing)
Lot of times we didnt even have
a landing strip Wed set down
on a plateau like that one
there Yeah that ones easy
you could glide right in

Suddenly he turns in the seat and pins Eric against the
door with his left foot

The plane flies erratically With his right foot Corbett
kicks the fuel jettison lever on the instrument panel
jamming it on

90 EXT CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)

The lever used to empty the fuel tanks in case of
emergency does so with great expediency All the gas is
instantly discharged

91 INT CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
Corbett releases Eric and calmly sits back up in his seat

Eric rubs his neck incredulous Corbetts move was too
fast and too outrageous In a moment the engine SPUTTERS
to a stop Eric struggles to hold the stick steady and
glide the plane down to the plateau Corbett pointed out

CORBETT
Hope you got your moneys worth
on those lessons

92 EXT CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
Theres an even chance of hitting a mountain instead of the

plateau Eric pushes the Cessnas nose down The plateau
comes up fast
The plane drops lower and lower pitching and yawing in the
wind

It CRASH LANDS its metal underbelly SCREECHING as it hits
the jagged granite under the snow It stops suddenly
flipping tail over nose

93 INT CESSNA
It rests upside down in the snow The men are dazed

Behind Eric one of the extra fuel cans now hanging upside
down leaks gas In front of him the engine is ON FIRE

Eric undoes his seat belt and rights himself but his leg
gets caught in the tangled belt He pulls out a Swiss Army
knife and cuts the rope binding Corbetts handcuffs to the
seat Corbett pushes the passenger door open Panicking
Eric tries to pull loose of his seat belt painfully
wrenching his ankle

94 EXT CESSNA

Corbett rolls out into the snow With no time to grab his
supplies Eric clambers from the wreckage He and Corbett
crawlroll down the incline of the plateau away from the
plane

A moment later the leaking gas reaches the burning engine
and the Cessna EXPLODES

WIDER

Eric tries to stand He cries out and falls into the
powdery snow clutching at his ankle

Corbett realizes Eric is at a disadvantage But before he
can bolt Eric grabs for the 357 magnum under his coat He
lies on the snow gasping pointing the gun at Corbetts
midsection

ERIC
Stay put

CORBETT
You got the belly to look me in
the eye and pull the trigger

Eric cocks the guns hammer with his thumb
ERIC

Be no different than shooting a
rabid dog

The men face off for a tense moment

Corbett smiles and zips up his jacket dispelling the
tension Letting the hammer down Eric looks back at the

burning plane

ERIC
(continuing)
Next time you want to kill
yourself dont include me

CORBETT

I took the odds on getting down

Now

in one piece and I made it
were in my territory

ERIC
With light clothing and no
supplies this is nobodys
territory

CORBETT
You sound like the tourists
Know-it-alls who read about
survival in a magazine Fuck

you You wont make it off this

mountain

Corbett drops his facade of conviviality Eric is too angry
to be intimidated He takes the scarf from around his neck

and wraps his ankle with it
ERIC
Lets go
94 CORBETT
(re Erics ankle)

Im not gonna carry you out of

here

ERIC
Thats right Youre not

CORBETT
Look take these cuffs off
need to work together

ERIC
Forget it

We

Eric holds his wristwatch up points the hour hand at the
sun counts forward to noon and accordingly makes an
approximation of their direction

ERIC
(continuing)
Last time I checked the flight
plan we were forty miles
northeast of Devils Cauldron
Southwest is that way No sense
waiting for a goddamn taxi

Grimacing with pain he gets up Clutching the magnum he
shoves Corbett in front of him and starts walking Corbett
frowns -- its tough to trudge through the snow with his

arms cuffed tightly behind his back

Eric looks around and tries not to let his emotions register
on his face They wouldnt be farther from the rest of
humanity on another planet Smelling fear on Eric Corbett
enjoys the view And waits

95 EXT ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - LATER THAT DAY

The Endicott range is full of jagged peaks icy streams and
gnarled tundra valleys Squinting in the glare of the snow
Eric and Corbett trek through the grandiose Gates of the
Arctic area The smoldering plane wreckage is a hard-won
snow-covered mile behind them

Intricate patterns of fragmented rock strips of scruffy
tundra and bedrock outcrops produce lonely foreboding
mosaics upon the landscape The air is still The silence

is itself a disconcerting presence Ten miles ahead and two
thousand feet lower the forest begins But here on the
rock face of the mountains Eric and Corbett might as well
be in a desert

ERIC
Itll be interesting trying to
build a fire without any wood

CORBETT
Welcome to the environment Mr
Ecology Out here one mistake
is all you get

Determined and dour Eric pushes on

CORBETT
(continuing)
Why in hell you care enough about
me to die taking me in

ERIC
I dont plan on dying

Its all academic The sheer magnitude of the surroundings
makes them feel theyre the only people in the world

TO
96 EXT ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - DUSK

The sun drops behind the mountains A wind whips up
chilling the men through their clothing Eric tries not to
shiver He spies a small rock formation with a granite
elbow protruding from it making an enclosed triangle of
solid rock

ERIC
Well stop here dig out a snow
shelter

CORBETT

Snow shelter Okay You dig
Ill have a little sit-down

Corbett sits on his haunches and smiles while Eric digs near
the rocks Although he knows Corbett is testing his every
move Eric refuses to let his patronizing air get to him

CORBETT
(continuing)
Even in the drifts this snows
too powdery to make a shelter
When youre done jerking around
reach down the back of my coat

Eric approaches him suspiciously He puts his hand down
through Corbetts collar Something is stowed inside a
homemade flap in the lining of his coat Eric pulls out a

folded nylon tarp with twine threaded through corner
eyeholes He shakes the eight by eight orange tarp open

97 EXT NYLON SHELTER - EVENING
Eric and Corbett have stretched the tarp out tent-style next
to the granite rock formation making a minimal but

functional refuge from the cold night

98 INT NYLON SHELTER

DISSOLVE

CUT TO
The men huddle inside the tarp Eric keeps a wary eye on
Corbett -- at all times he treats him like a rattlesnake
Eric unwraps his ankle and rubs it Its swollen to the
size of a softball

CORBETT
Still quite a hike to Devils
Cauldron
(beat)

Days A long stretch to go
without sleep my friend You
can hide behind that pistol for
now but take your eyes off me
long enough to sneeze --

ERIC
-- Turn around

While poking the 357 in Corbetts ribs Eric one-handedly
unlocks Corbetts right manacle pulls his arm through the
granite elbow then locks it back up again Hes learning

99 EXT HAUL ROAD - DREAM - (AS IN SCENE 3)

Eric is hurrying along the pipeline in his business suit
following the predators paw prints in the snow He peers
ahead and his prey becomes visible But it isnt a wolf
its Corbett His hands and face are covered in blood

DREAM
100 EXT ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - DAWN

The sun peeks over the mountain tops drenching them with
light and color

101 INT NYLON SHELTER

The light hits Erics eyes He bolts awake from a fitful
sleep Corbett sits already awake looking like hed
uproot the rock to which hes chained if he could He waits
for an opportunity -- any opportunity -- with the patience
of a vulture

102 EXT ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - SMALL VALLEY - DAY

Eric and Corbett trudge up to the bank of a frozen stream
bisecting their path Its simple -- to continue they have

FADE TO
END
CUT TO
to cross it Corbett takes in the scenery in no particular
hurry Frustrated but making dead sure hes always got the
drop on Corbett Eric puts a tentative foot on the ice

CORBETT
Ice is too thin -- you can see
the water moving underneath

ERIC
Were not sitting here til
November Theres a cargo plane
coming to Devils Cauldron in
four days and Im putting you on
it

CORBETT

We get wet we freeze to death in
a couple hours

ERIC
Ive been on ice like this when I
was a kid skating Spread your
weight keep moving Go on

Corbett is not about to be outdone in the guts department by
someone with a Masters Degree

CORBETT
(gestures you first)
Be my guest

ERIC
(points 357)
Im right behind you

Frowning Corbett tentatively steps onto the ice and inches
across the fifteen feet to the other bank

NEW ANGLE
He turns and indeed Eric is right behind him

CORBETT
Wait til Im across

Eric doesnt want to be too far from his prisoner He keeps
coming The ice GROANS and HISSES under their weight

Corbett is three feet from solid ground He drops to his
knees then stomach and rolls like a log the rest of the

way

Eric splays out on the ice and crabwalks across The ice
makes an ominous CRACKING and water begins to seep through
air holes

Standing Corbett weighs his chances of bolting from Eric

Eric crawls doubletime He makes it onto solid ground just
as the ice under him breaks off in a big thin clear plate

CLOSER
Eric sits on some rocks Corbett glares it him

CORBETT
Most dangerous thing in the
world A regular Joe in over his
head You trying to prove how
tough you are for me or for

yourself

ERIC
It wasnt my idea to crash the
plane

CORBETT

Lets camp Theres grayling
under this ice Ill snare some
for dinner

ERIC
(standing)
Weve got another two hours of
daylight

CORBETT

Pushing it is flat wrong All
you prove is your ignorance about
breaking trail

Eric is not convinced Grumbling Corbett gets up and
takes the lead as they continue southward

103 INT THE TURTLE - DARKROOM - DAY

Trying to keep busy Anne Marie develops some prints in the
darkroom shes made from the front bathroom She glances at
her watch and sighs her mind on Erics overdue return

104 INT THE TURTLE - FRONT MODULE
Anne Marie comes out of the darkroom and hangs the prints up
to dry Outside (OS) a car HORN blares a couple of times

Grinning she runs to the door

105 EXT INT THE TURTLE
Meyerlings Dodge truck pulls up Anne Marie comes outside

Her smile wilts when she sees its not Eric As Meyerling
climbs the embankment to the Turtle he glances at Wilders
snowmobile parked alongside the Turtle

MEYERLING
Ive been trying to raise you on
the shortwave for two days

He pushes past Anne Marie and goes into the Turtle

ANNE MARIE
Have you talked to Eric

MEYERLING
I have not but I very much want
to What do you know about the
trouble in Devils Cauldron

ANNE MARIE
I was hoping you had some news --

MEYERLING
-- Get this straight Im the
District Supervisor Whatever
you do reflects on me It wasnt
my idea to bring you people up
here but Im stuck with you
You are absolutely not to involve
yourself in any local disputes
Whichever side you take you
alienate the other Mr Corbett
is quite well-known in this
region People admire him --

ANNE MARIE
-- Corbetts a killer

MEYERLING
I dont care if Ben Corbett makes
meatloaf out of nuns and babies
hes not your concern
Understood

Anne Marie just glares at him Meyerling examines the
damaged shortwave

MEYERLING
(continuing)
What happened here

ANNE MARIE
The radios on the fritz

MEYERLING
Whered you say Eric is

ANNE MARIE
Somewhere along the pipeline

MEYERLING
What about that hotheaded
marshal Sam Wilder I heard he
was in the middle of this mess

ANNE MARIE
Sam We havent seen him

MEYERLING
Really I thought maybe that was
his snowmobile outside

(beat)
By the way -- your truck also on
the fritz

ANNE MARIE
(blanching)
Why

MEYERLING

Its out by the pumping station
shot full of holes

Noting Anne Maries distressed reaction to this news he
crosses to the door

MEYERLING
(continuing)
Still nothing to tell me
(no reply)

Suit yourself

106 EXT ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - DAY

Eric limps further down from the mountains Corbett keeps
pace in front of him and his magnum As their altitude
decreases there is ever thicker vegetation

Their tracks in the snow stretch up behind them into the
distance The magnificence and grandeur of the surroundings
cannot be overstated Picture the most rustic overwhelming
wilderness imaginable and then make it ten times larger

NEW ANGLE - LATER
The mens way is once again interrupted this time by a
sheer granite drop The steep decline would be tough to
negotiate with mountaineering equipment and proper footwear
Corbett peers over the edge and shakes his head

CORBETT
Have to backtrack find another
way down

ERIC
Forget it It would take days

CORBETT
(assessing the drop)
Going to be a bit of a challenge
with handcuffs on

Eric realizes hes right After some deliberation Eric
cautiously approaches him With the 357 cocked and ready
he undoes one of the cuffs leaving them hanging from
Corbetts wrist He then unthreads the nylon twine from
Corbetts tarp

ANGLE - GRANITE SHEER

Eric and Corbett are tied belt to belt with the nylon
rope Corbett inches down first feet spread for maximum
footing gloveless hands grasping at anything

Eric mimics Corbetts moves and follows the same path
Unable to grasp the rocks effectively he stops and takes
his gloves off Continuing he winces -- the rock is cold
and sharp His hands are soon numb and bloody Even in the
dry below-freezing air Eric is sweating

He looks down and hangs on more tightly Sliding to level
ground two hundred feet below would pummel him to hamburger
Corbett pauses and rests his cheek against the rocks Eric
is right above him

Suddenly Corbetts foot slips His right hand
instinctively goes for a hold The dangling handcuffs snare
on a protuberance knocking him off balance

The fulcrum of Corbetts body leans out into the empty air
Eric moves down a little braces himself and extends his
leg giving Corbett something to grab Corbett takes hold
of Erics shoe and tries to teeter back against the rock
wall Adrenaline screams through Erics system

Corbett looks up at Eric A careless move will send them
both tumbling Eric clutches harder at the rocks and waits
for the worst

After a long moment Corbett regains his balance and lets go
of Erics foot He continues his descent Eric lets out
his breath and tries to swallow His mouth is as dry as the
granite

CUT TO
107 EXT TREELINE - LATER THAT DAY

Handcuffed again Corbett hikes in front of Eric along the
top of some foothills Now and again he glances behind
gauging Erics weariness waiting for a moments
carelessness Around them there is heavy vegetation now --
snow-covered sedge tussocks knee-deep muskeg and twisted
thickets that are treacherous and slow to tramp through
Above them ominous clouds and sharp cold winds are coming
down from the north

But below a mile ahead the edge of the forest is like the
hem of a great green garment stretching endlessly southward
The combination of altitude and latitude creates an
amazingly sharp topographical dividing line Within a few
thousand yards the landscape abruptly changes from scrub
brush to thick coniferous forest

CORBETT
Better get into those trees
before that squall blows down

Then Corbett pauses as a walloping sound ECHOES across the
foothills

Just ahead two enormous bull moose are fighting They ram
each other with six-foot-wide antlers

Corbett stares transfixed admiring
CORBETT
You talk about ecology -- there
it is

Eric turns surprised at Corbetts unabashed awe

Catching the mens smell the moose bound away and the spell
is broken

108 EXT MINING SETTLEMENT - EVENING

Viking Bob Mitchell and LeMalle head somberly back to

112 EXT INT NYLON SHELTER - NIGHT

Corbett and Eric sit under the nylon shelter The STORM
rages outside Eric empties his pockets of Eskimo potato
reindeer lichens bistsort sorrel and other plants for his
dinner

Corbett has fashioned a snare from his boot laces and a tree
branch and placed some crushed roots as aromatic bait next
to a small animal burrow outside the shelter A squirrel
sticks his nose out of the burrow to investigate

Corbett sits catlike ready to pounce Eric grimaces as
Corbett yanks on the snare and the squirrels SQUEALS (OS)
abruptly cease

113 INT NYLON SHELTER
Corbett pulls his dead dinner inside

CORBETT
I need your pocket knife
(Eric hesitates)
I have to eat too

After a beat Eric pulls open the small blade on his Swiss
Army knife and pushes it with his foot to Corbett Smiling
Corbett admires the fancy knife Then BELOW FRAME he
skins and guts his catch

CORBETT
(continuing)
Damn lucky this storm didnt blow
down when we were on those
baldheaded mountains It
continues we better stay put

ERIC
It could blow over tomorrow too

CORBETT
Im still figuring Youre either
real brave or real dumb

ERIC
I just want this over with

CORBETT
(laughs)
Where in hell Meyerling dig you
up

ERIC
You know Meyerling

CORBETT
Sure The Peoples Friend Kiss
your ass with precision if
theres a vote in it

Corbett eats the squirrel Eskimo-style Raw He uses the
knife like a native too holding the meat in his teeth
then expertly cutting off a mouthful with a quick slice
Eric stares disgusted Off his look

CORBETT
(continuing)
Always eat your meat raw when the
weathers cold Does you more
good long as the entrails look
clean

Corbett uses snow and the squirrels fur to wipe the blood
from his face then wipes the knife off and lays it open
next to his leg

ERIC
Ill hold onto that

With a wry smile Corbett pushes it back over to Eric
While Eric eats his dinner Corbett listens to the STORM and
watches him eat

CORBETT
Sure love to know where you fit
in up here

114 INT THE TURTLE - NIGHT

Anne Marie is frantic with worry She has the AMFM RADIO
on for company

This is Tundra Topics on
KFAR Remember as the nights
get longer be sure to stay ona
regular sleep schedule The
depression from the coming of
winter that doctors call
Seasonal Affective Disorder --
or ‘Arctic Blue to us lay folk
-- is preventable

Anne Marie tunes the radio to Pipeline of the North on
KIAK

RADIO (VO)
(continuing)
John Byers was hospitalized in
Fairbanks today for an infection

in an abscessed tooth Mr Byers
had a toothache and attempted to
remove the tooth himself with a
pair of pliers

Suddenly a BUMP rocks the Turtle Someone is outside
Startled Anne Marie turns the lights off and looks out the
window

No sign of a vehicle or a person As she pulls on her
parka she glances at the big rifle leaning against the
wall but doesnt touch it

115 EXT THE TURTLE

Her visitor whoever it is is behind the Turtle Anne
Marie cautiously rounds the corner and stops dead

NEW ANGLE

A foraging GRIZZLY sniffs around attracted by the smell of
fresh carrion -- Wilder Eight feet tall and eleven-hundred
pounds its used to having its way Right now its
hungry

With a casual swipe of its paw its massive claws puncture
the Turtles aluminum skin popping open the door of the

utility compartment The bear pokes its head inside and
Wilders body slumps out into the snow The bear pushes at
the corpse with its snout Salivating it prepares to dig
in

Anne Marie looks around wondering what the hell to do nEXT
Wilders snowmobile is a few yards behind her parked
against the side of the Turtle She inches toward it
Testily the bear looks up SNIFFING loudly

Keeping her eyes on the bear Anne Marie feels for the
snowmobile ignition keys Theyre not there She feels
around inside the saddlebags and finds three emergency road
flares

Anne Marie IGNITES the flares They illuminate the area
with an eerie reddish glow She YELLS at the bear wields
the flares like Excalibur and moves forward

The bear reluctant to leave so hearty a pre-hibernation
meal GROWLS and cocks its head back and forth to assess the
threat As Anne Marie inches ahead the bear stands on hind
legs to its full height to meet the challenge

Anne Marie tosses a flare toward the bear It grunts when

the flare hits it and shuffles backwards Anne Marie
throws another flare With a ROAR from hell the bear
charges Anne Marie falls back Still holding the last
flare shes forced into a crawl space under the Turtle

ANGLE - UNDER THE TURTLE

Anne Marie tries to squeeze out the other side but shes
pinned in by the unevenness of the hard ground The bear
swipes at her its huge paw inches away Anne Marie jabs at
the paw with the flare but that only makes the bear more
quarrelsome

She twists around looking for a defense Above her is the
cabling from the generator to the circuit box for the
Turtles electrical system She tugs at it but it wont
budge The bear SNIFFS at Anne Marie with its big wet
snout Anne Marie notices warning a sign on a control
valve

DANGER
BLACK WATER
UNTREATED SEWAGE

Grimacing she tries to turn the valve After much effort
it SNAPS and opens releasing a stream of fetid sewage

WIDER

The bear gets a muzzle full of the stuff HOWLING
unhappily it backs away GRUNTING and SNEEZING Greatly
offended its appetite gone it lopes into the forest

Anne Marie squirms out from under the Turtle and gagging
from the horrible smell pulls off her wet parka

CUT TO

116 EXT WOODS NEAR THE TURTLE - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT
Wearing one of Erics coats Anne Marie stands in the center
of three similarly-sized trees A FLARE supplies the light
The big Remington rifle leans against the tree closest to
her
She tosses one end of a hundred feet of nylon rope over a
sturdy tree branch twenty-five feet from the ground Then
she throws the other end over an opposing branch and
stretches the rope like a clothesline

She attaches a second length of rope perpendicular to the
first and throws it over a third tree branch midway between
the other two She kneels and ties something BELOW FRAME to
the cross-length rope

Pulling mightily on the perpendicular rope she hoists
something heavy to the level of the branches The flare
burns out plunging the area into darkness

Anne Marie wraps the rope around the tree trunk and
nervously tries to LIGHT another flare As she does the
forest seems closer sinister filled with lurking ogres
Seized with an instinctual fear she grabs the rifle and
runs back to the Turtle

FADE TO
117 EXT ENDICOTT FOOTHILLS - DAY

The storm has passed leaving a fresh covering of powdery
snow in drifts like sand dunes Eric and Corbett trek
toward Devils Cauldron through the ever-thickening forest
Corbett has made them snow goggles by cutting slits in
strips of tree bark worn like sunglasses Eric using a
tree branch as a walking stick still limps on his sore
ankle For the first time he keeps the magnum stuck in his
waistband

CORBETT
Theres a cabin maybe twenty
miles south of here

Too bad were heading west

CORBETT

Theres a snowmobile Inside a
day we could be on the Yukon I
got money there Remember that
five thousand Make it ten Be
smart Take it and walk away

ERIC
(bristling)
You dont get it do you

Corbett takes advantage of Erics poor peripheral vision
from the visor by kneeing Eric in the face Eric falls
backwards into the snow Corbett takes off like a
jackrabbit Eric spits out some blood shakes the stars out
of his eyes and yanks the 357 from under his coat

ERIC
(continuing)
Stop

Corbett bounds through the snow dodging trees and
snow-covered rocks

Eric squeezes off a SHOT and is startled by the recoil and
the blast He scrambles to his feet and SHOOTS again

Corbett zigzags and disappears from sight over a snowbank
NEW ANGLE - FOLLOW CORBETT

Corbett runs over a frozen stream invisible under a cover
of snow Suddenly the ice SHATTERS under him Corbett is
immersed in frigid waist-deep water He gasps from the
sudden temperature drop

ERIC
hobbles after him CUSSING bitterly to himself
CORBETT

crawls to solid ground Disoriented from the shock to his
system he rolls over to catch his breath

WIDER
Eric appears over a snowbank

Corbett tries to run but his frozen waterlogged legs feel
like pig iron Stumbling and panting he looks for a safe
place to cross the stream Eric easily catches up to him
Corbett sits in the snow shivering He looks up as Eric
trots over

Eric glares at Corbett and rubs the bruise on his cheek

CORBETT
Nothing personal Just wanted to
see what youd do

Noticing Corbetts sopping legs Eric becomes furious
CORBETT
(continuing)
Have to get these wet things off
ERIC
Youre not going to slow us down

Keep moving

117 CORBETT
Inside of three hours youd be
dragging my dead carcass

Fuming Eric helps Corbett up

118 EXT ENDICOTT FOOTHILLS - EVENING

The sun sinks below the horizon creating across the
mountains a spectacular show of color and shadows The wind
HOWLS

119 INT NYLON SHELTER

Eric stokes a fire at the mouth of the shelter Corbetts
pants and boots hang to dry from branches next to it He

huddles under the tarp covered by his coat drowsy and
listless

ERIC
Stay awake You want to go
hypothermic

CORBETT

If that means freeze my balls
off no thanks

(yawns)

Ill be okay

Eric examines him Corbetts skin is white and rigid his
lips are pale blue He scowls at Eric

CORBETT
(continuing)
Told you Im fine

ERIC
(holds up three fingers)
How many do you see

CORBETT
(irritable)
What Fuck off Save yourself

ERIC
You dont feel cold

CORBETT
Its a spring day

He starts to doze off The shivering hes been repressing
now racks his body Eric sits him up closer to the fire
and puts his own parka over Corbetts shoulders With his
foot Eric rolls some hot rocks bordering the fire closer to

Corbetts legs Eric rubs his arms and hands but it isnt
enough Eric loathes the specter of death even Corbetts
He shakes him trying to keep him awake

ERIC
Wake up goddammit Youve got
classic hypothermia --
crankiness fatigue cant feel
your coldness Worst thing you
can do is fade out

Corbett is headed someplace far away Sighing Eric turns
him so his back faces the fire He unbuttons Corbetts
shirt then unbuttons his own shirt and lies across Corbett
Eric gasps -- Corbett feels like a slab of ice Corbetts
teeth chatter Hes completely unconscious

ERIC
(continuing)
One more thing -- this doesnt
mean were going steady

Later Corbett rests fitfully It could go either way
Eric chews on some roots and pokes at the fire to keep it
lively

DISSOLVE TO

Its night Some color has returned to Corbetts skin

Eric turns as Corbett mumbles and clutches at the front of
his shirt His eyes open He tries to sit up but hes too
weak

ERIC

Below the only light on the endless expanse of dark earth
comes from the Turtle

refuels the generator Something catches her eye --

ANNE MARIES POV
In the distance headlight beams jostle along the Haul Road
BACK TO SCENE

Anne Marie caps the diesel fuel can and stows it away
ANNE MARIE
(grinning)
Its about time

She hurries back into the Turtle

121 INT THE TURTLE
Anne Marie brushes her hair and makes herself presentable
122 EXT THE TURTLE

The vehicle gets closer Its the trappers jeep It slows
and parks on the Haul Road next to the Turtle

123 INT THE TURTLE
Anne Marie peers out the window She gasps as she

recognizes the jeep Ducking from sight below the window
she grabs Erics coat and hurries into the rear module

124 EXT THE TURTLE

Mitchell stays in the jeep Viking Bob and LeMalle get out
and walk cautiously toward the Turtle

LeMalle stands midway between the jeep and the Turtle
cradling his carbine Viking Bob goes up the steps

125 INT THE TURTLE - REAR MODULE

Anne Marie remembers something she shouldve taken with her
the rifle Too late She hears Viking Bobs FOOTSTEPS (OS)
come up the wooden stairs outside

126 EXT THE TURTLE

Viking Bob knocks on the front door He peers through the
sheer curtain on the window into the front module

VIKING BOB
Hullo

He shrugs to the others then tries the door Its
unlocked

Mitchell gets out of the jeep spits and follows the others
in his hand close to the Colt Peacemaker strapped to his
leg

127 INT THE TURTLE

Anne Marie climbs out a window in the back She closes it
behind her just as Viking Bob pokes his head in the rear
module

The trappers snoop around noticing that the coffee pot is
still warm etc The emptiness is ominous LeMalle picks
up the big Remington bear rifle He opens the breech to

determine if its loaded and sniffs the barrel to see if

its recently been fired Viking Bob notices the damaged
radio

VIKING BOB
Somebody left in a big hurry
(to LeMalle)
Check outside

128 EXT THE TURTLE
LeMalle goes outside and shines his flashlight around
NEW ANGLE

In the back Anne Marie drags an evergreen tree branch
behind her to cover her tracks in the snow then climbs into
the utility compartment where Wilders body was stored

A moment later LeMalle comes around the corner He notices
bear tracks and scat from the prior nights visit

LEMALLE
(calls out to others)
Grizzly sign Looks fresh

Viking Bob and Mitchell converge with LeMalle They point
their flashlights around spotting footprints and marks
going off into the woods

129 EXT WOODS NEAR THE TURTLE

Tense and silent the trappers follow the marks A breeze
RUSTLES the needles of the evergreens around them They
stop at the point the footprints end A rhythmic CREAKING
above them makes LeMalle shine his light upward

NEW ANGLE

The light REVEALS Wilders feet swinging back and forth
above their heads His body is suspended in the manner of a
trail cache Viking Bob lets out a startled grunt He and
Mitchell shine their lights on Wilders face

MITCHELL
Its Sam Wilder

VIKING BOB
Musta wanted to keep him from the
bears If Ben killed him he
sure as hell wouldnt hang him up
like this

MITCHELL
Wheres the kid

LEMALLE
Who gives a husky fuck Wheres
Ben
The trappers look glumly at one another

130 INT UTILITY COMPARTMENT - THE TURTLE

Anne Marie jams herself behind a pile of her photo
equipment She stops as she hears the trappers boots (OS)
CRUNCH in the snow past her and go inside the Turtle

131 INT THE TURTLE

The trappers peel off their overcoats They look around at
the comfortable surroundings

MITCHELL
I should get me a job with an oil
company

He sits on the couch and lays his scrimshaw and engraving
tools out on the coffee table LeMalle helps himself in the
well-stocked larder
LEMALLE
I say we eat torch this fuckin

thing and move on

LeMalle digs through the cupboards and comes up with a fresh
bottle of Scotch

VIKING BOB
Go easy

LEMALLE
Cool out I aint about to get
blasted
CUT TO
132 EXT THE TURTLE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Flashlight in hand gloriously drunk LeMalle stumbles
outside He crosses to the jeep to grab a box of Twinkies
and as long as hes at it take a leak in a snowbank
Bleary-eyed he notices the damage to the utility
compartment inflicted by the bear

He walks to it stepping over the bear scat He marvels at
the size and depth of the clawmarks

LEMALLE
Big mother musta wanted something
real bad in here

LeMalle tries the door but its jammed shut He tucks his
flashlight under his arm and gives another tug This time
the door cracks open

CLOSER - HIS POV

He peers through the opening and shines his flashlight in
A pair of eyes stare back at him

WIDER

LeMalle jumps back startled and pulls out his knife He
tries the door again It WRENCHES open

Hes looking at his own face in one of Anne Maries
mirrored photo reflector boards

Letting his breath out LeMalle pokes around the equipment
in the compartment Ever larcenous he pulls a few items
out examines them and disinterested leaves them in the

snow Doing so he comes close to uncovering Anne Marie
who sits motionless and terrified in the back of the
compartment

Nothing in the compartment catches LeMalles fancy Leaving
the door hanging open he wanders away

133 INT UTILITY COMPARTMENT - THE TURTLE

After hes gone Anne Marie reaches over and closes the
door She can hear the trappers (OS) CONVERSATION inside

VIKING BOB (OS)
I know in my gut he was here
First light we try to get scent
of his trail

Sighing Anne Marie stuffs her hands inside her parka and
tries to get comfortable Its going to be a long night

FADE TO
134 EXT ENDICOTT FOOTHILLS - DAWN

Eric and Corbett wearily trudge through the woods Corbett
has the tarp wrapped around him for extra warmth As he
walks he sniffs at one of Erics Eskimo potato roots and

takes a tentative nibble

CORBETT

Used to see the natives eating

roots when I was a kid

ERIC

Nome I figure youd be a
whaler coming from there

CORBETT

Told thats what our old man was
Planned on going to sea me and

muskrat
(off Erics look
That was fine money

ERIC

Killing wildlife not good enough
anymore so you go on to bigger

and better things

CORBETT

You got a knack for seeing things
the way you want to see them

They walk in silence Corbett tightens the tarp against the

cold air and looks at Eric

CORBETT
(continuing)

Dont judge me Youre a joke

ERIC

He shoves Eric with his handcuffed hands

CORBETT
(continuing)
Tell me what I should do

Livid Eric backs away and knocks Corbetts hands away from
him

ERIC
Dont push me

CORBETT
Cowardly bastard Im in
handcuffs and I still scare the
piss out of you

Eric smashes his fist into Corbetts face Corbett reels
back more surprised than hurt Eric moves in furiously
throwing punches Corbett plows his clenched fists into
Erics midsection doubling him over Gasping Eric rams
his head into Corbett and they fall into the snow
Despite the handcuffs Corbett gets a few blows in They
wrestle fiercely and Eric ends up on top of Corbett Hes
about to throw another punch when Corbett looks up at him

CORBETT
(continuing)
First you save my ass now you
want to kill me Make up your
goddamn mind

134 Eric lowers his fist and climbs off of Corbett Corbett
gets up and they continue on their way in sullen silence

135 EXT DEVILS CAULDRON - DAY

Sunday morning Chimney smoke rises straight up in the
still morning air and mingles with the wisps of fog hanging
above the Devils Cauldron valley

A scratchy RECORDING of a HYMN (We Will Gather at the
River) plays through a PA system ECHOING forlornly off the
hills The PEOPLE of Devils Cauldron walk through the new
snow to the center of the settlement Some older Women
mostly head for the dance hall where the HYMN originates

136 INT DANCE HALL

The Women SING along with the HYMN They face a shelf
holding the PA a rusty TV and record player And in front
of the shelf an unmanned pulpit

139 EXT FOOTHILLS ABOVE DEVILS CAULDRON - DAY
Exhausted Corbett and Eric climb across the last set of
foothills before the Devils Cauldron valley The town
comes into view below them faintly the MUSIC carries from
below Corbett looks at Eric and breaks the silence

CORBETT
What makes you so sure my boys
wont be waiting for us

ERIC
They think youre in Fairbanks
If not they still wont find you
before the plane comes tomorrow

CORBETT
Dont bet on it

ERIC
I already have

CORBETT
You dont know how true that is

Eric sweeps the snow from between two rocks and sits down

ERIC
Well wait here until nightfall
No fire no tarp

Corbett sits next to him After a long moment

CORBETT
Didnt mean it you being a
coward Youre a lot of things

but chickenshit isnt one of
them

ERIC
Maybemaybe not Ill tell you
what scares me -- stumbling
through life like an ordinary
jerk Thats why I want to work
on the front lines where what I
do means something

Soon as I got here I realized my
job was bullshit Oil company

leave then I thought screw it
Tll outsmart them do the work
anyway

(beat)

Eric glances over as a look of utter desolation crosses
Corbetts face

140 EXT HAUL ROAD - THE TURTLE - DAY
The trappers file out the front door

VIKING BOB
My guess is hes loose and
heading for Chukfoktulik Hell

settlement without a lawman

LeMalle carries his booty with him Viking Bob looks at him
disapprovingly as he puts the big Remington rifle in the
jeep

LEMALLE
I aint gonna leave a seven-
hundred-dollar Remington behind

VIKING BOB
(exasperated)
What you gonna do with it Large
bores for shit on small game

LEMALLE
Not in the right hands it aint

To demonstrate he rapid-fires several SHOTS from the hip
taking the radio antenna off the roof of the Turtle
shattering panes of glass in an accurate succession and
blasting the door latch off the utility compartment

Pleased LeMalle slams back the bolt ejecting a spent
shell He glances curiously at the door of the utility
compartment and starts toward it

LEMALLE
(continuing)
Thought that door was open last
night

VIKING BOB

Quit fucking around Get in

LeMalle climbs into the back of the jeep With Viking Bob
driving they pull away

hurries on to more important business

143 INT UTILITY COMPARTMENT - THE TURTLE

As soon as the SOUND of the jeep fades away Anne Marie
clambers out of the utility compartment Haggard and numb
with cold she helplessly watches as the fire ravenously
devours the rear module Shielding her face from the
flames Anne Marie reaches under the accordion cover between
the modules With great effort she unbolts the coupling
bracket

144 INT DIESEL RIG - THE TURTLE

Anne Marie STARTS the engine SLAMS it into gear and

lurches the front module away from the burning rear module
She shuts the motor off and trying to hold back the tears
watches the rear module BURNING

Bone weary Eric and Corbett walk toward town staying on
the outskirts to avoid being seen They look at one another
-- this moment seemed impossible not very long ago No one
seems to notice as they limp into Wilders cabin

146 INT WILDERS CABIN

Its dark Eric locks Corbett up in the holding cell not
noticing that Corbett seems almost pleased to be there He
blocks the windows pumps up the pressure on the white gas
lantern and heads back outside again

The temperature dips as the winds shifts and blows down from
the north Another storm approaches The temperate days of
last week seem ages ago

Kenai Neff and other TOWNSMEN batten Devils Cauldron down
for the STORM Kenai is bundled up in the cold The men
tighten guy wires on the radio tower windmills and caches
bring firewood indoors close off unused rooms in the
general store and spa Then Neff and Kenai split off from
the others

149 INT HOT SPRINGS SPA

Via a catwalk Neff and Kenai climb up into the ceiling
struts above the partitioned cubicles in the spa to caulk a
roof leak with pitch Neff is sullen from his conversation
with Eric Kenai however is smiling at Neff

NEFF
Why the smirk

KENAI
Bet I could make some money
turning Ben Corbett in Maybe
more for lettin him loose
(off Neffs flustered look)
I was up in my cache Saw the
Northland man come talk to you

NEFF

from the cot in the cell

yours

ERIC

You broke the radio remember

CORBETT

Im sure shes fine Seemed like
a clever kid

Corbett sits up as Eric hands him a plate of beans

CORBETT
(continuing)

You were real resourceful out
there Got me thinking of this
perimeter man froze all his
fingers one winter So he hacked
the tips off and sharpened the
exposed bones Gets along better
than ever Yeah maybe I
underestimated you

ERIC
I liked you better frozen You
didnt talk so much

CORBETT
Youre damn lucky glimpsing this
country before its ruined gone
for good You saw wonders youd
only dreamed of That alone
makes you different than the
sorry bastards back where you
came from because you have
dreamt them

Corbett sees hes hit a nerve with Eric

CORBETT
(continuing)
Remember that demon in the gut
Sometimes its nothing more than
wondering if the so-called
civilized life has bred the balls
and brains out of you Thats
what you want out of this isnt
it

ERIC
All I want want is you in jail --

A KNOCK at the door interrupts Eric lowers the flame on
the gas lantern and peers out through a corner of the

cardboard in the front window Frowning he cracks the door

open and slips outside
151 EXT WILDERS CABIN
Its Neff and Kenai Neff looks guiltily at Eric

NEFF
(explaining)
He saw you and Corbett come in

KENAI
Dixies waiting at the infirmary
Shell put a splint on that
injured leg

Eric is skeptical of Kenais concern

NEFF
Dont let him fool you Real
reason hes here is to buy
Corbetts traps

Eric looks at Kenai then at Neff Neff nods that its

okay As extra precaution Eric handcuffs Corbetts right

wrist to the frame of the cot inside the cell

ERIC
(to Kenai)
Okay You can talk to him But

Ill keep the keys with me

Outside the wind HOWLS Eric enters and walks into the
hallway connecting the bath partitions A hand grabs his
arm Startled he turns around

Its Dixie wearing a threadbare flannel robe

DIXIE

Twenty-five dollar

Eric shakes his head -- typical Kenai He gives her three
tens She smiles and leads Eric toward the infirmary
Its actually a bath partition outfitted with an examining
table and a first-aid kit

153 INT WILDERS CABIN - NIGHT

Neff paces nervously Corbett smiles at him and Kenai

trouble The kids got the key
and besides he looks edgy enough
to use that magnum hes carrying

Relax Ill get loose in time

KENAI
Any traps you dont want Ill
pay cash money

CORBETT
Guess someone should use them
Open the bottom drawer in
Wilders desk My kits in
there Might as well unload
everything

Kenai tugs on the drawer Its locked Undaunted he
jimmies it open with a knife Neff groans Kenai goes to
throw Corbett the duffel bag but Neff grabs it He checks
for weapons pulling out a hunting knife Satisfied he
hands Corbett the bag through the bars

With his free hand Corbett digs through his belongings
clothing freeze-dried provisions jerky paperback books
He looks up and shrugs
154 INT HOT SPRINGS SPA - NIGHT

Erics ankle is in a resin cast His foot rests on a stool
While waiting for the cast to set he soaks in the bathtub a
hot towel draped over his face Above him on a wall

bracket a closed circuit TV plays a war-surplus PORNO FILM

The door CREAKS open and Dixie comes in She impassively
checks his cast -- which is interesting as shes now
wearing panties clog shoes and nothing else Eric takes
the towel off his face and sits up astonished

DIXIE
I wash your back for you You
will like it

Before Eric can protest the door OPENS again Its
Meyerling He snaps his fingers at Dixie to shoo her and
she scurries away

MEYERLING
I hate to interrupt playtime but

Over the sound of LeMalles exertions there begins an
insistent succession of BEEPS The Whore looks over

Pushing her off of him he blows the jeeps HORN three

You cant see past your lousy
little assignment sniffing
around the pipeline The few
voters there are in this district
look up to Corbett and Im not
about to alienate them

ERIC
I should release Corbett because
you want some votes

This miserable wilderness is a
state of the union Policys

Manhattan for beads With a
handful of votes you control the
greatest frontier since white men
stumbled onto the New World

Some day these peoplell wake up
and youll be the first one
theyll run out of here

Erics attention turns to a rhythmic INTERFERENCE on the TV
screen There are three short bursts followed by three
long bursts Something about it is very familiar
Scowling he sits up

Eric finds Corbetts 44 magnum He puts it and some
speedloaders full of 357 hollowpoints in his pockets

163 EXT INT DEVILS CAULDRON - MONTAGE
Eric hobbles across town to the hot springs under cover of
the early hour and heavy snowfall He paces out several
circuitous routes from the rental cabins to the airstrip at
the edge of town pausing now and again along the way

He hears a door SQUEAK open and someone COUGH nearby so he
stands motionless in the snow

Bundled in wool blankets Kenai trundles down to his
outhouse

After Kenai passes by Eric sneaks inside the spa He
climbs up into the catwalk

As Kenai goes back to his cabin he notices that the antique
bear traps on display in front of the general store are
missing Suddenly Eric grabs him and pulls him into the
spa doorway

Pretty clever If the trappers
got that signal beacon and get

figure youre waiting for an

place theyd expect you is on the

But we live here No one wants

Neff opens the door for Eric

ERIC

(angry)
You dont care enough about Sam
to --

NEFF
-- Sam Wilder was my cousin
Hes why I came to Alaska All
his letters saying what a
paradise it is But me ending up
dead wont do Sam a lick of good

166 EXT WILDERS CABIN

Anne Marie waits in front as Eric hobbles up She looks at
his bad ankle

ANNE MARIE
Youre hurt

ERIC
Nothing broken Cmon we have

to hurry

He leads her inside

167 INT WILDERS CABIN

Corbett is calmly reclining on the cot in the holding cell

CORBETT
Couldve told you no one would
help
Seeing Anne Marie he smiles
CORBETT

(continuing to Anne Marie)
Maybe you can talk sense into
your boyfriend

ERIC
Shut up

CORBETT
(to Anne Marie)

Either way you better clear out
I dont want anyone innocent
getting harmed

This comment has the intended effect on Anne Marie Angry
Eric throws Corbett a coat Corbett puts it on Reaching
through the bars Eric cuffs Corbetts hands together
ERIC
Were moving Lets go

As they exit Corbetts sardonic look makes Anne Marie
shiver

168 INT RENTAL CABIN

The ten-by-ten cabin is furnished with two sagging cots a
beat-up color TV set a cookstove and a half-drum heat
stove Built into the rear wall is a rustic dumb waiter
that once lowered perishables into the icy waters of a
now-dry stream

Eric checks his watch 615 AM He bolts the door and
blocks the windows opening one enough to let sound in from
outside He extinguishes the Benman lantern and douses the
fire in the heat stove so no smoke will emit from the
chimney Anne Marie slumps into the corner next to the dumb
waiter

ERIC
Youll catch a chill by that dumb
waiter shaft Sit on the cot
(hands her the 44)
Keep this pointed at him if I get
preoccupied

Anne Marie reluctantly takes the huge gun Trying to allay
her fears Eric sits and brushes the hair from her face
Corbett intently watches them Before he can say anything
Eric shoots him a cold look Corbett stays quiet

169 EXT INT DEVILS CAULDRON - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY

A pall hangs over the town People know to stay inside
Time crawls by

In his house Neff for once has his TV turned off He
tries to read and listens for sounds outside

In the spa water DRIPS somewhere All the stalls are
empty

In his sod house Kenai looks out his one tiny window at the
curtain of snow Dixie comes up behind him and puts her

hands on his shoulders He looks up at her glum

In Wilders empty cabin his belongings are scattered about
as if expecting his imminent return

In the rental cabin Eric checks his watch 1045 AM
170 EXT DEVILS CAULDRON - NEAR WILDERS CABIN - DAY

The sound of a MOTOR grows in volume then abruptly ceases
The trappers jeep APPEARS in the snowfall on the road into
town It coasts quietly in and stops behind the cover of a
woodpile across from Wilders cabin

The trappers get out of the jeep lLeMalle has Erics
Remington Mitchell has his Peacemaker and Viking Bob
carries LeMalles old carbine Mitchell spits Its so
cold outside that the spittle freezes and CRACKS before it
hits the ground

They fan out and approach Wilders cabin

ANGLE WITH TRAPPERS

The cabin comes more clearly into view as the trappers move
closer There is no sign of life Viking Bob gestures for
the others now positioned on either side of the cabin to
crouch down for cover

VIKING BOB
(calls out)
Ben Ben Corbett

No response Carbine held at his hip Viking Bob walks up
to the door and with a mighty kick BREAKS it in

REVERSE ANGLE - THROUGH WILDERS CABIN DOOR

Viking Bob points the carbine at an empty room He notices
however Corbetts duffel bag on the floor of the cell

171 EXT DEVILS CAULDRON

The trappers march through town like an advancing army
looking for some sign of Corbett LeMalle stops to dig
through his pockets for some food All he comes up with is
the stump of a candy bar Viking Bob looks at him
impatiently

VIKING BOB
Look we pull Bens ass out of
the fire Ill get you a whole
damn crate of Snickers bars

LEMALLE
(insulted)
Im right fuckin here with you

To prove his point LeMalle trots from dwelling to dwelling
looking through windows and letting himself in through any
unlocked door This proves fruitless so he lets out a
frustrated YELL Pointing the Remington skyward he lets
off a couple thunderous SHOTS that ECHO back off the
foothills

172 jINT RENTAL CABIN

Hearing the shots Eric pushes Anne Marie against the floor
Cautioning her to stay put he crawls to the window and
tries to see through the snowfall After a moment of
silence from outside not too far away

LEMALLE (OS)
Ben Speak out before I torch
every dump in town

Eric points the magnum at Corbett

ERIC
Answer and Ill shoot

CORBETT
You kill me you sign your death
warrant
(re Anne Marie)
And hers

173 EXT DEVILS CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI

Viking Bob and Mitchell come running over to LeMalle
LeMalle fires another couple SHOTS for emphasis

LEMALLE
(calls out)
You hear me Ben

VIKING BOB
(to LeMalle)
Ease off We do this my way

He and the others strain their ears for a clue

VIKING BOB
(continuing calls out)
Whoevers holding Ben Corbett
listen to me we just want to
know hes okay He is nobody
gets hurt

174 INT RENTAL CABIN

His mind racing Eric stares at Corbett Despite the
freezing temperature of the room hes sweating
CORBETT
They know Im here I dont say
something theyll plow this town
under You willing to accept
that responsibility

Setting his resolve Eric drags Corbett to the window He
pushes the barrel of the magnum against Corbetts cheek

ERIC
Say youre okay Tell them Ill
kill you if they rush us

Anne Marie bites her lip and tries to maintain a brave
front Despite the gun in his face Corbett remains calm

CORBETT
(shouts through window)
Bob

175 EXT DEVILS CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI

Hearing Corbetts voice the trappers spin around trying to
ascertain its direction

CORBETT (OS)
Relax I got a nervous man here

with a magnum up my nose

The trappers follow his VOICE toward the rental cabins

VIKING BOB
You in one piece

CORBETT (OS)
Im fine Look forward to seeing
you

VIKING BOB
Count on it

176 INT RENTAL CABIN

Eric pulls Corbett away from the window He shoots a look
at Anne Marie Theyre in a bind and she knows it

177 EXT DEVILS CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI
LeMalle grabs Viking Bobs arm
LEMALLE

(to Viking Bob)
Sweet-talk wont get shit
(calls out)

Choose it asswipe -- cut Corbett
loose or soon as you come
outside I put a fuckin bullet
through your eye

178 j§INT RENTAL CABIN

Eric glances at Corbett whose grim look certifies LeMalles
boast

CORBETT
Snows to their advantage kid
You cant see them but soon as
that plane comes theyll sure as
hell know where were going
Wise up Take me to the Yukon
Ill give you that money and
guarantee youll walk away

ERIC
Why offer a buyoff with your
gunmen waiting outside

CORBETT
The time has passed for men like
them and me I know it But
theyre still fighting for
survival like cornered animals
Thats why theyll kill you
-more-

CORBETT (Contd)
(smiles)
Be rude to let that happen after
you kept me from freezing back
there

Anne Marie tries to hide how tempted she is by Corbetts
offer

ANNE MARIE
(to Eric)
Hes right about the snow Were
blind
Eric sighs -- is she against him too From outside
VIKING BOB (0S)
Ben

The trappers are obviously much closer Eric signals to
Corbett not to answer
NEW ANGLE

Eric and Corbett face the window They dont notice as Anne
Marie quietly shimmies outside through the narrow dumb
waiter shaft to the back of the rental cabin Eric turns
gasping as he realizes shes gone Corbett smiles
sardonically

CORBETT
At least your girl had the sense
to jump ship Too bad shes the
only one small enough to fit
through that dumb waiter

179 EXT DEVILS CAULDRON - FOLLOW ANNE MARIE

Using the cover of the snowfall Anne Marie circles around
the outside edge of town toward Wilders cabin She takes
some of her photo gear from the snowmobile

180 EXT DEVILS CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI

Unaware of Anne Maries maneuver the trappers wait for a
response from Corbett None comes Viking Bob places a
calming hand on LeMalles shoulder

VIKING BOB
Just wait we dont know what
this guys up to Benll let us
know what to do

181 EXT DEVILS CAULDRON - ANTENNA TOWER

With a camera bag slung over her shoulder Anne Marie climbs
up the metal antenna tower behind Neffs house on the edge
of town She grits her teeth and fights back a wave of
vertigo The ground disappears from sight hidden by the
snow and fog

Fifty feet up she attaches her infrared video camera to the
tower crossbars and using a length of coaxial cable hooks
its RF output to the feedline of the community TV antenna
182 INT RENTAL CABIN

Eric looks at his watch 1055 AM

183 EXT DEVILS CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI

A CRACKING twig behind the cabins gets the trappers

attention Clutching his rifle LeMalle goes to
investigate
WITH LEMALLE

as he probes through the snow listening He reaches the
edge of the woods and finding nothing returns to the
others

NEW ANGLE

Anne Marie crouches behind a tree twenty feet behind
LeMalle After a moment she tiptoes back toward the rental
cabin

184 INT RENTAL CABIN

Eric and Corbett turn as Anne Maries camera bag suddenly
drops from the dumb waiter shaft Anne Marie wriggles back
inside Before Eric can say anything she puts her fingers
over his mouth She turns on the TV set and tunes it to
channel 3

ANGLE ON TV

A fuzzy IMAGE comes into view Its Devils Cauldron from
the vantage of Anne Maries infrared video camera The
falling snow shows up as a translucent yellow wash over the
scene Buildings are distinguishable as bluish silhouettes
Heat-producing objects -- warm walls chimney smoke etc --
are pink and red And there are three clearly-definable
human figures standing near the Maqi The trappers

BACK TO SCENE

Corbett is amazed Eric smiles at Anne Marie

ERIC
Your infrared camera

ANNE MARIE
(nods)
Technology in the wilderness
Only problem is talking to you on
your way to the landing strip

ERIC
Ive got an idea Well have to
work fast

He digs through Anne Maries bag of equipment and supplies
then stops and looks up Outside there is an OS SOUND that
is felt before it is HEARD The cargo PLANE approaches in
the distance

185 EXT DEVILS CAULDRON - NEAR MAQI

The trappers look at each other as the SOUND of the plane
grows louder

VIKING BOB
Theres what theyre waiting on

MITCHELL
(smiles tightly)
Theyll have to come right past
us

186 EXT RENTAL CABIN

Eric quietly pulls the door open Holding the pistol to
Corbetts head he pushes Corbett out in front of him

Anne Marie and Eric exchange a long look Fighting back
tears she reaches up and touches his face

ERIC
When you ran off I thought youd
keep going til you were back
home in Washington

ANNE MARIE
My home is here With you

He smiles Then he and Corbett are gone lost from sight in
the snowfall After a beat Anne Marie takes a deep breath
and slinks away in the other direction toward the dance
hall

ANGLE NEAR THE MAQI

The trappers wait twenty-five feet from Eric and Corbett
The DRONE of the plane grows louder

ERIC AND CORBETT

start toward the airstrip Corbett sees a patch of bare
dirt and SCUFFS his feet in it

ANGLE NEAR MAQI

The trappers turn to the SOUND heard under the RUMBLE of
the still-distant plane Converging they head in that
direction Suddenly Anne Maries VOICE booms through the
town

ANNE MARIE (0S)
(over PA)
Theyre moving toward you

WIDER

Eric SHOOTS a couple times then backtracks and pulls
Corbett behind one of the rental cabins

Ducking the bullets the trappers sprawl onto the ground
187 INT DANCE HALL

Anne Marie has turned on the rusty TV near the pulpit
While watching the infrared IMAGE of the action outside she
holds the microphone wired to the old PA

ANGLE - THE TRAPPERS
Viking Bob gestures to Mitchell and LeMalle to separate

ANNE MARIE (0S)
(over PA)
Theyre fanning out

Angry LeMalle BLASTS his rifle in direction of her VOICE

LEMALLE
(to Viking Bob)
Kenais PA -- but how the fuck
she seein us

VIKING BOB
Doesnt matter We know where
theyre going Cmon

Stalking anxious LeMalle follows Viking Bob

MITCHELL
splits off from them and looks for footprints in the snow
188 EXT ALLEY

Eric pushes Corbett through a narrow pass between two
buildings in the center of town He walks in Corbetts
footprints Almost through to the other side he suddenly
stops Pulling Corbett with him Eric walks backwards
still carefully placing each foot in an existing footprINT
Corbett cant help but smile

189 INT DANCE HALL

Watching the TV screen Anne Marie sees one of the red blips
change direction and head toward her
ANNE MARIE
(into mic)
One is moving back toward the
cabins

190 EXT DANCE HALL

Its LeMalle He crosses to Kenais generator With a
well-placed rifle SHOT to its innards he GRINDS it to a
halt

191 INT DANCE HALL

The TV PICTURE disappears as the power dies Anne Marie
keys the PA microphone its dead too

192 EXT ALLEY

Eric and Corbett emerge from between the buildings Eric
backtracks toward the hot springs spa now leaving an
obvious trail

193 EXT HOT SPRINGS SPA

Eric and Corbett go inside Eric pulls the door closed
behind them but leaves it ajar

194 INT KENAIS HOUSE

The DRONE of the approaching plane is ever louder Kenai
stands and pulls on a succession of sweaters Dixie looks
at him

DIXIE
Earl its crazy to go out there

KENAI
I hear someone in the spa

He straps on a holster under his sealskin coat
195 EXT DEVILS CAULDRON - AIRSTRIP - LONG SHOT

The big 4-prop plane is about to touch down on the far side
of the snow-covered airstrip

196 INT DANCE HALL
Anne Marie zips up her parka and cautiously goes outside

197 EXT HOT SPRINGS SPA
LeMalle follows the footprints to the door Eric left ajar
He peers inside

198 INT HOT SPRINGS SPA

Its tomb-quiet except for water DRIPPING and pipes
CREAKING LeMalle looks around The sound of a small DING
against metal above him gets his attention

He sees a fleeting shadow cut across the catwalk above him
He finds a metal ladder slings his rifle over his shoulder
and climbs up Hearing another SOUND on the far side of the
catwalk he hurries across holding onto the pipes for
balance

LeMalle is directly above the huge central pool He ducks
to go under a long piece of twine running from the ceiling
to a dark corner below Suddenly the twine snaps tight
pulling open a heavy trap door on the ceiling The door
swings down and knocks LeMalle off the catwalk With a
yelp he splashes into the water below

NEW ANGLE

Hidden in the shadows Eric drops the end of the twine and
rushes toward the front door with Corbett in tow

ERIC
(to Corbett)
Thatll keep him out of the cold
LEMALLE

climbs out of the central pool soaked He pulls his wet
jacket off and furiously throws it down

199 EXT HOT SPRINGS SPA

Eric leads Corbett around the back of the spa A GUNSHOT
rings out nearby and a BULLET hits the wall above Erics
head

MITCHELL

has seen their faint silhouettes through the snow He
purposely SHOOTS over their heads so he doesnt hit Corbett

ANGLE BEHIND HOT SPRINGS SPA

Eric and Corbett crouch down and double back They are
once again swallowed up by the snowfall

200 EXT ALLEY
Viking Bob follows their footprints in between the
buildings He continues to a point where they converge to
one set then stop He smiles at the naivete of Erics
ploy Looking at the boardwalk railing above he assumes
Eric and Corbett have swung over it onto the iced-over
boardwalk Pleased with his deduction Viking Bob continues
along the alley

SNAP Viking Bob lets out a horrible HOWL and falls on his
back in the snow Biting into his right calf is a huge
conibear leg trap In extreme pain he struggles to lever
it open with the barrel of his rifle

201 EXT KENAIS GENERAL STORE

Corbett shoots Eric a dangerous look as Viking Bobs CRIES
carry though the town

ERIC
Hell live

202 EXT ALLEY

Hearing Viking Bobs cries Mitchell backtracks and rushes
to Viking Bobs aid Between them they manage to yawn open
the jaws of the trap and free Viking Bobs leg Viking Bob
tries to walk but the leg wont support him -- the bone is
broken Bitterly frustrated he waves Mitchell on In
agony Viking Bob eases down in the snow He tears a strip
of lining from his coat and wraps his leg to stop the
bleeding

203 EXT HOT SPRINGS SPA

Anne Marie scurries by on her way to the airstrip
Suddenly the hot springs door bursts open and LeMalle
lunges at her Stripped of his wet clothes hes wrapped

in blankets and furs his feet protected by sacks lashed to
them His wet body and hair steams in the frigid air

Anne Marie lets out a startled cry and springs away from
him She falls hard on her back knocking her wind out
Scrambling for footing in the snow LeMalle drops his rifle
He comes at her again Anne Marie moves away and pulls the
-44 magnum out LeMalle stops and glares at her

ANNE MARIE
(gasping)
Dont make me shoot

She gets up keeping the magnum pointed shakily toward him
LeMalle glowers menacingly

ANNE MARIE
(continuing)
Were going to Sams cabin You
can stay in the jail until this
is over

LeMalle slowly crouches down for his rifle Anne Marie
wields the handgun at him but he doesnt stop

LEMALLE
Want to chance it with that
hog-leg You cant even hold it
up Better drop me first shot
bitch or Ill rip your fuckin
lungs out

Taunting sneering LeMalle stares her down Anne Marie is
paralyzed Feeling that hes won LeMalle wraps his bony
fingers around the stock of the Remington

Anne Marie closes her eyes and FIRES Pulling the rifle
close LeMalle tucks and rolls and jumps to his feet Anne
Marie FIRES again and AGAIN Shot LeMalle hobbles away
leaving a trail of blood in the snow Numb Anne Marie lets
her arm fall

204 EXT BOARDWALK NEAR WILDERS CABIN

Eric looks around at the sound of the shooting fearing the
worst He pulls Corbett off the boardwalk and they cut
across open ground toward the airstrip depot

205 INT HOT SPRINGS SPA

Kenai looks around at the messy RESULTS of LeMalles
ransacking for things to wear Kenai turns startled when
he hears footsteps Its Neff and Meyerling

KENAI
(disgusted)
Lookit this damn mess Where in

NEFF
(after a beat)
Dead Trappers killed him

KENAI
Aw Jesus Told you this was
trouble
(to Meyerling)
What about you big shot Do

something Whos side are you

MEYERLING
Hey I thought you people loved
Corbett and his wild men

KENAI
This shoot-em-up shit is bad for

MEYERLING
What about you Neff

NEFF
Well two of the trappers are
down already --

MEYERLING

(suddenly on the bandwagon)
-- One left three of us Lets
finish it

NEFF
What about Eric Desmond

MEYERLING
Ill handle him

206 EXT YARDS BEHIND AIRSTRIP DEPOT

Through the snow Eric can see the faint outline of the
plane on the runway He and Corbett hurry toward the back
of the airstrip depot

As they wend their way through the junk-filled yards Eric
catches a glimpse of movement around a corner REFLECTED in
a pane of glass leaning against a roll of tar paper

ERICS POV - REFLECTION

Peacemaker in hand Mitchell is behind the depot coming
right for them

WIDER
Eric takes out the homemade flashbomb He lights it tosses

it toward Mitchell and covers his eyes It EXPLODES with a
muffled pop and a bright flash of white light

Mitchell stumbles backwards and blinks his eyes The flash
has temporarily clouded his vision

Eric moves Corbett to another approach to the depot and
waits for Mitchell to move on

207 EXT REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT

Mitchell is about to do just that when a hand on his
shoulder stops him Its LeMalle oblivious to the profuse
bleeding from his right shoulder Mitchell blinks still
having trouble seeing LeMalle gestures for him to be quiet
and points in Eric and Corbetts direction

LEMALLE
(whispers)
Over there

He hoists his Remington
MITCHELL

(whispers)
Hold it You might hit Ben

LEMALLE
Bullshit I hit what Im aiming
at

MITCHELL

Let em come closer first

But LeMalle is too anxious He swings the rifle up
left-handed and SHOOTS

NEW ANGLE

The bullet just misses Eric He panics and wildly returns
FIRE with the 357

208 EXT REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT
Mitchell and LeMalle scatter under the hail of bullets

ANGLE ON ERIC AND CORBETT
as they HEAR LeMalles labored footsteps run past them
nearby Eric peers cautiously around the corner toward the

depot There is no further movement

Eric waits a moment then leads Corbett cautiously toward
the depot

209 EXT REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT

Reaching the rear wall they practically stumble over
something Its Mitchell lying on the ground near the
wall badly wounded by Erics barrage Eric gasps
Anguished Corbett kneels next to Mitchell Mitchell pulls
him closer

MITCHELL
Glad to see youre okay I told
LeMalle not to shoot
(tries to smile)
Had some fine seasons didnt
we

Mitchells grasp on Corbetts coat relaxes as he dies
Horrified Eric stares at the man he killed Noticing the
scrimshaw lying on the snow where it slipped from Mitchells
pocket Corbett picks it up

CORBETT
(to Eric)
Fifteen years on the trail with
this man I never saw him rise to
anger

Glaring at Eric Corbett dips his hand in Mitchells blood
and suddenly smears it across Erics mouth Repelled Eric
pulls back

CORBETT
(continuing bitterly)
Your first kill How does it
taste

Wiping his face sickened and desolate Eric has no reply

WIDER

Then from somewhere close by LeMalle FIRES at them Eric
stuffs the 357 in his belt and uses a brick to knock the
padlock off the back door of the depot He pushes Corbett
inside

210 §INT CARGO PLANE - COCKPIT

The pony-tailed ex-hippie PILOT shuts his engines off and
removes his Walkman headphones Hearing LeMalles
continuing GUNSHOTS the Pilot pulls his door closed and
turns on his two-way radio

PILOT
(into radio mic)
Circle this is BMY-955 I just
touched down in Devils Cauldron
Nobodys here to greet me like
usual and theres gunfire Im
getting scarce
With that he STARTS his engines up again
CUT TO ERIC IN DEPOT

who turns startled when he hears the ENGINES coughing to
life Os

211 j§INT CARGO PLANE - COCKPIT

The Pilot fiddles with his controls and prepares to take
off He looks up surprised as the passenger door suddenly
opens

WIDER
Anne Marie slides onto the seat

ANNE MARIE
You cant leave yet

PILOT
Its my responsibility to get
this aircraft out of here safely

Anne Marie points the 44 at him

PILOT
(continuing)
You got to be kidding

ANNE MARIE
Leave the engines idling Go
back and open the side door

Shaking his head and muttering the Pilot unfastens his seat
belt climbs between the two seats to the cargo compartment
and obliges the little lady with the big gun

212 jINT AIRSTRIP DEPOT

The depot as temporary-looking as the rest of Devils
Cauldron is a boxcar-shaped loading dock and warehouse with
a corrugated steel roof Boxes wood palettes and hand
dollies are piled haphazardly about

Eric and Corbett navigate through the piles of boxes
inching toward the front door -- the door leading to the
plane

Suddenly a string of overhead lights come on Eric goes
for the 357 then stops when he sees Meyerling Kenai and
Neff have come in the front door Kenai stomps his feet and
shivers Grandstanding for the others Meyerling steps

forward

MEYERLING
Nobody wants any more killings
we all agree to that correct
(no one argues)
Thats good Now Eric youre
gonna hand your prisoner over to
us

ERIC
Fuck you

MEYERLING
This isnt your concern Its
over here and now

CORBETT
(to Meyerling)
Sure when you put a bullet in my
back on the way out Easier for
all involved

MEYERLING
Not a bad idea Face it Ben
Theres no room in Alaska for you
any more

Meyerling pokes with his foot at a tipped-over rack of
Eskimo paraphernalia -- masks furs big skin drums fish-

and bear-spears

Meyerling moves toward

Eric looks at Neff

MEYERLING
(continuing)
Youre as antiquated as this
shit

Corbett but Eric stands in his way

ERIC
Keep back

CORBETT
Youre quite a piece of work
Meyerling The tide changes you
ride right along with it

ERIC
Neff you know better than
this

NEFF
Youre an outsider Mr Desmond
Step aside stay out of it

Kenai and Neff move in with Meyerling Eric stands his
ground and reaches for the 357 in his belt

NEW ANGLE

Suddenly LeMalle stumbles into the depot the blankets and
furs dragging at his feet His right side is bathed in
blood Half-frozen bled dry he looks ready to drop down
dead In his left hand impossibly he still clutches the
massive Remington

He hoists it to his hip and grits his teeth as he BOLTS a
round into the chamber with his injured right arm Bracing
himself he levels the rifle at Eric

Hearing the ACTION of the rifle Eric turns

Corbett reaches down grabs a rusty Eskimo spear in both his
handcuffed hands and hurls it

There is a deafening ROAR as LeMalles rifle discharges

LeMalle flies back from the recoil -- and from the spear
stuck clear through his chest

Some packing material above Erics head smolders ignited by
the muzzle blast

NEW ANGLE

There is a moment of silence Corbett looks at the other
weapons near him and then at Meyerling Threatened
Meyerling pulls out a 380 automatic Before Eric can do
anything Meyerling FIRES

The IMPACT of the bullet throws Corbett against some boxes

212 With a YELL Eric jumps Meyerling and rips the gun from his
grasp Enraged he pummels Meyerling with it until Kenai
and Neff pull them apart Eric wrenches away from them and
scrambles to his feet with Meyerlings gun in his hand

ERIC
(continuing)
Anybody moves and Ill shoot

Holding the 380 on them Eric crosses to Corbett Bleeding
from the abdomen hes trying to stand up

ERIC
(continuing)
Can you walk

CORBETT
Wounds a through-and-through

Missed my liver I think

ERIC
Lets get out of here

Cautiously backing away from the others Eric helps Corbett
get up and shuffle toward the OS SOUND of the cargo plane

How come you didnt let him shoot

CORBETT
(softly)

Like I said Id still be up on
that mountain frozen solid it
wasnt for you

ERIC
Well get you to a hospital soon
as we get to Fairbanks

CORBETT
So they can patch me up and put
me in a cage Forget it
Meyerlings right -- Ima
dinosaur Greedy bastards like
him its their turn with this
land Put me in the woods let
me live or die on my own

He painfully pulls himself into a sitting position
CORBETT

(continuing peers out
window)

Look down there tell me what any
of this matters Struggles of
men get swallowed by the bigness
Soon there wont be a trace of
our troubles or us

ERIC
Youre wrong Everything we do
leaves its mark You said it

yourself -- there are hundred-
year-old footprints in the
tundra

Too tired to argue Corbett leans back against the window
He takes Mitchells scrimshaw out of his pocket and looks at
it

something to the Pilot Grumbling the Pilot adjusts his
controls

steps down onto the snow-covered runway
