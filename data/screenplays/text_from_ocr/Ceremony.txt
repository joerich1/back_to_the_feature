OVER TITLE CARD

SAM (VO)
He would not take no for an answer

INT BROOKLYN PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY
CLOSE ON an illustrated manuscript of a children’s book

A rudimentary colored pencil drawing shows a young man in an
old-fashioned deep-sea diving suit grappling with an older
blonder more handsome merman holding a trident

SAM (0S)
Our young hero was unfazed as the
evil king raised his trident to
strike But the diver unsheathed
his spear gun and fired like a
madman driven by love and revenge
His harpoon struck the merman’s
heartor what was left of it
anywayand blood shot out like a
miniature geyser

A hand turns the page The next page shows the dead king
lying on the ocean floor a harpoon in his chest and blood
spraying the seaweed red A beautiful mermaid trapped inside
of a bubble looks on The diver reaches for her hand

SAM (0S) (CONTD)
With one last act of bravery the
diver had slain him The evil sea
king was no more The bubble
surrounding the princess burst as
our hero bent down on one knee “We
have to move fast” the young diver
said “His men are on their way
But first I’ve been meaning to ask
you something” and his hand held
out a small pearl

The page turns once again The drawing shows the diver on one
knee holding open a clam to reveal a shiny white pearl The
princess stares down at it flattered

SAM (OS) (CONT’D)
The princess smiled “Don’t
bother” she said “My bags are
already packed”

The hand turns to the last page which is a picture of the
diver and the princess riding away on a humpback whale A
cluster of pink coral spells out “THE END”
Pull back to reveal SAM DAVIS 23 sitting on a small stool
at the front of the room closing the book He has longish
hair parted to one side and the beginnings of a moustache He
wears a faded cardigan sweater and cheap corduroy trousers

Sam removes his tortoise shell glasses and tucks them in his
shirt pocket He looks up

SAM (CONTD)
Any questions

REVERSE SHOT of a handful of young children sitting with
their respective parents on small rocking chairs and floor
mats a look of confusion or indifference on most of their
faces

Some faint applause drifts from the back of the reading area
where MARSHALL SCHMIDT 24 stands alone leaning on a
bookshelf wearing an expensive red striped sweater and
slacks He has an innocent face and a bit too much pomade in
his hair

SAM (CONT’D)
Thank you very much
(beat)
Sohow did everyone feel about
the ending Would you say you found
the whole thing believable for the
most part

Silence A few of the parents lead their children away A
YOUNG BOY in overalls raises his hand

SAM (CONT’D)
Yes you in the overalls

YOUNG BOY
I liked the sea horses

Sam nods not really taking this into consideration

SAM
That’s nice Anyone else

YOUNG GIRL
Id like to be the mermaid

Sam raises an eyebrow

SAM
Rightbut what about the
relationships Who did everyone
gravitate to emotionally
(MORE)
SAM (CONTD)
Did you feel that the diver ending
up with the mermaid was too easy

Just then an older LIBRARY ATTENDANT in a rumpled tweed suit
leans INTO FRAME and taps Sam on the shoulder Sam looks up
at him

SAM (CONT’D)
Yes

The elderly man talks quietly in Sam’s ear

LIBRARY ATTENDANT
I’m sorry butwho are you What
are you doing here

SAM
I’m workshopping my story This is
a public library isn’t it

LIBRARY ATTENDANT
(hesitates)
Iyou can’t do that

CUT TO

We TRACK BACKWARDS with Sam as he walks briskly towards the
exit He holds a white canvas suitcase with brown leather
piping Marshall follows holding some books under his arm

SAM
I thought they responded well back
there don’t you

Marshall looks around A couple security guards are huddled
around the Library Attendant in the background who is now
pointing in Sam’s direction

MARSHALL
Yeah I thought it went great Are
we in a hurry or something

SAM
Not at all I’m just eager to get
this show on the road

We follow them OUTSIDE onto the front steps Sam notices the
books under Marshall’s arm

SAM (CONT’D)
What’s that you got there
MARSHALL
Just some things I’ve been meaning
to read but I never got around to
I remember you recommended this one
to me a long time ago

Sam looks at the book It’s an old hardcover copy of The
Catcher in the Rye

MARSHALL (CONTD)
You always said it was your
favorite

Sam looks at Marshall and squints furrowing his brow

SAM
Yeahwell Then I grew up

Sam continues to walk Marshall looks confused

IE STATION WAGON (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

Marshall drives Sam sits in the passenger seat He glances
back at Marshall’s three large suitcases nestled in the
backseat

SAM
That’s a lot of luggage for three
days Marshall

MARSHALL
Well I wasn’t exactly sure what to
be prepared for You weren’t very
specific over the phone

Sam sifts through Marshall’s luggage pulling out a pair of
flower-print swim trunks snorkel gear a crushed velvet
blazer some pomade Sam holds up a terrible-looking leather
jacket and give Marshall a look

MARSHALL (CONT’D)
I was thinking if there were girls
at our hotel I’d want to look
nice
(beat)
You think there’1l be girls there

SAM
Of course but that’s not what this
trip is about This is about you
and me getting some sun and
relaxing Catching up
(nudges Marshall)
(MORE )
SAM (CONTD)
And if there happen to be some
girls staying at our hotel then
well just deal with that when it
comes up

Marshall taps the steering wheel smiling

MARSHALL
Great That’s really great It’s
been such a long time you know

SAM
Since you’ve been with a woman

MARSHALL
No no Since you and I have done
something like this Together
(pause)
But yes to the first part as well

SAM
Are you kidding We had lunch not
that long ago

MARSHALL
To be honest Sam I don’t think
I’ve seen you for at least a year

SAM
A year Are you out of your head
I took you to lunch right after you

had your whole”accident” You
told me you were seeing that girl
Mary

MARSHALL

Who’s “Mary”

INT DINER - DAY
Sam and Marshall sit on opposite sides of a booth
MARSHALL
Anyway I think your moustache
looks great Very mature

Sam insecurely rubs his hands over his pathetic moustache

SAM
You really think so

A beat Sam sighs looking down at his untouched peanut
butter and jelly sandwich There is some awkward silence
SAM (CONT’D)
I’ve just been working so much
that’s why I’ve been so terrible at
calling you back It’s the new
book It has nothing to do with you
personally But you know that

MARSHALL
Well it was great seeing you in
action back there The characters
in this one were much more
developed than that other one you
sent me The one about the two
caterpillars--

SAM
That’s actually one of my worst
ones

MARSHALL
It’s great you’re able to write all
these stories and still have a real
job during the day

Sam smiles

SAM
That is my real job actually
(beat)
Let’s get the check

A WAITRESS walks past the table Sam waves his hand

SAM (CONT’D)
Marshall I need you to get this
one I left my wallet in the car

EXT GAS STATION - DAY

Marshall pumps gas into the beat up station wagon Sam leans
against the car tapping his foot incessantly wearing sun
glasses

MARSHALL
You know honestly I was ready to
dive into the job market myself I
sent a bunch of resumes took a
meeting and thenwell that
whole disaster happened and I moved
back in with my parents You know
the whole story

(MORE )
MARSHALL (CONTD)
I guess it was just the universe’s
way of telling me to slow down and
take my time you know It’s been
pretty impossible leaving the house
lately Until now at least

Sam looks at Marshall

SAM

Yeah God I can imagine that whole
thing being prettytraumatic

(beat)
But that’s why I organized this
trip We’ve got to get you out of
your apartment and back to your old
self

Sam pulls out a cigarette and lights it

MARSHALL
When did you start smoking

SAM
I don’t inhale

EXT NEW YORK COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

The beat up Mercedes makes its way around the winding country
roads The crashing grey sea on one side green fields on the
other

EXT DRIVEWAY - LATER

The car drives past a faded wooden gate down an unassuming
pebbled driveway It bumps up and down mercilessly on the
unpaved road until we get our first glimpse of

an OVERSIZED WHITE HOUSE with pale blue shutters It’s
surrounded by trees on both sides with a large beach and a
stunning view of the sea behind it The white paint is
starting to peel but large tangles of ivy do a fair job of
concealing it

As Marshall’s car pulls around the bend we see a slew of
parked cars resting on an unruly lawn of grass and reeds

Several GUESTS in tasteful attire remove luggage from their
respective trunks A handful of BUTLERS and MAIDS in uniform
aid them carrying luggage through the front door It all has
an air of European elegance about it
Marshall’s car pulls around the circular driveway and stops
the car in front of two enormous double doors

IE STATION WAGON - CONTINUOUS

Sam and Marshall are sitting quietly looking around at all
the activity outside the car Marshall looks confused Sam is
wearing sunglasses

MARSHALL
Is this our place

SAM
No Our place is just down the
road We must’ve taken a wrong
turn

Marshall watches the older guests walk past his window Sam
looks anxious peering through windows clearly searching for
someone

MARSHALL
Do you know these people or
something

Sam ignores him Marshall catches the eye of a BLONDE MAID
carrying the bags of an elderly couple She’s delicate-
looking with fragile blue eyes Her gaze locks with
Marshall’s They share a brief moment just before she enters
the house

Out of nowhere a BUTLER taps on the windshield He motions
for Sam to roll down his window

BUTLER
Can I help you gentleman Are you
guests of ours for the weekend

SAM
You know what I think we’re
alright thanks so much

Marshall innocently calls out from the drivers side

MARSHALL
We’re staying just down the road

Sam whips his head around at Marshall The Butler seems
impatient A moment Sam slowly rolls the window back up
IE STATION WAGON (MOVING) - LATER
The boys are back on the road Sam looks enraged

SAM
Unbelievable Who the fuck did that
guy think he was Looking down at
us like we were middle class or
something

MARSHALL
I’m pretty sure he was just doing
his job And we are middle class
Sort of--

SAM
Are you kidding me He assumed we
didn’t belong there just by looking
at us This piece of shit car
didn’t help us much either

MARSHALL
It’s the only car my dad would let
me have for the weekend

Sam squints as he looks out the window towards a small
parking lot on the side of the road in the distance

SAM’S POV
A MAN stumbles out of a beat up blue Fiat and hastily
crosses the highway entering a local country market
BACK TO SCENE
Sam snaps his fingers
SAM
Pull over Let’s get some snacks
EXT GENERAL STORE - DAY

Sam and Marshall stand in front the general store The place
is wooden and pale green and resembles a barn

SAM
You go get some supplies and
alcohol for the room I need to
make a quick phone call

MARSHALL
Who do you need to call

Sam removes a crisp 10 bill from his wallet and hands it to
Marshall

SAM
Here get anything you’d like

MARSHALL
I don’t think this is enough

Sam is already gone

MINUTES LATER

Sam stands inside a phone booth staring down at a small
POSTCARD the front of which is a movie still from The Wizard
of Oz

He picks up the phone and begins to dial then hangs it up

All of a sudden Sam starts to hyperventilate His eyes are
glassy and red He puts his hand on his chest

He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath pulling himself
together

CUT TO

INT GENERAL STORE - CONTINUOUS

Sam walks down the aisle suspiciously having regained his
composure Marshall fills a wicker basket with provisions
Sam looks through Marshall’s basket holding up some malt
liquor and salmon jerky questioningly

Sam swaps the bottles for some club soda and a handle of
Irish whiskey

SAM
If we’re going to act like men this
weekend we need to drink like men

Suddenly a LOUD CRASH from one aisle over Several bottles
of beer roll along the ground Sam turns to see the Man from
outside standing over the broken glass He’s in his late
twenties gangly with a lit cigarette in his mouth He wears
a blazer and suit pants rolled up to the knee His bare feet
leave a trail of sand everywhere he goes This is TEDDY

Sams eyes widen He springs into action and grabs the top
few cases from Teddy’s hands

SAM (CONTD)
Let me help you with that

TEDDY
(English accent)
Oh cheers mate You’re a real
prince

SAM
It’s my pleasure I’m Sam

TEDDY
I’m called Teddy This is Ian

Teddy looks around for his friend to no avail

TEDDY (CONT’D)
I guess he’s still in the car

A look of recognition darts across Sam’s face

SAM
That’s an interesting accent
Teddy Whereabouts are you from

Teddy looks at him oddly for a moment

TEDDY
England The Northern part
originally Just in for the
weekend So appreciate you all
having us

CUT TO

Marshall attempts to catch the eye of an attractive Red Head
at the cash register but she ignores him coldly pointing to
the cash register which shows a total of 4548 Marshall
looks down at Sam’s 10 bill

EXT GENERAL STORE - DAY

Marshall has both his hands filled with the boys’ supplies as
Sam trails behind him helping Teddy carry the cases of beer

TEDDY

There’s a whole group of us over
here for the weekend We all sort
of commandeer this darling little
inn up the road that belongs to my
future brother-in-law It’s a bit
of a tradition Been doing it for
years now

SAM
You know I think your inn shares a
beach with ours We stay just up
the road at this charming boutique
motel Very quiet Different sort
of scene I guess

Marshall looks over eagerly unloading their groceries into
the station wagon

MARSHALL
We haven’t been together in a
while

Sam gives Marshall a strange look then turns back to Teddy

SAM
He means together as friends We’re
both very interested in women
though I mean obviously

Teddy opens the back door of his Fiat and hops in

TEDDY
Wellappreciate the hand Samuel
Our camp just sort of runs wild so
feel free to skip over to our side
of the beach if you’re so inclined
It’s all very casual

Teddy takes a sip from a beer bottle

TEDDY (CONT’D)
We’ll have one or two of these

Sam laughs clearly trying too hard
SAM
Or seven or eight of them You

never know with us right

The Fiat peels out narrowly missing a passing car

INT LITTLE MOHICAN INN (RECEPTION AREA) - AFTERNOON

It’s a quaint little bed and breakfast filled with odd
Northeastern Indian-type art and bright green carpeting

Marshall waits patiently by the luggage petting a tabby cat
as Sam argues with a very OLD APACHE wearing a fake head
dress at reception

SAM
I need you to just run the card
again please

OLD APACHE
But sir--

SAM
Run the goddamn card chief

INT LITTLE MOHICAN INN (ROOM 7) - LATER

Much like the lobby the room is dressed in Native American
overtones but it’s quite livable and spacious Sam lies on
the bed anxious staring at the decorated walls admiring a
small medicine shield with a wolf in the middle of it
Marshall is unpacking toiletries in the bathroom

MARSHALL
The shower is broken I couldn’t
get all the cream rinse out of my
hair

SAM
I just can’t get over that Indian
I swear I put money on that card
yesterday I’11l pay you back for
both our shares as soon we get back
to the city

Marshall enters the bedroom and starts unpacking all of his
belongings neatly into wooden cabinets He hangs up his coats
and rolls a lint remover over all of them

MARSHALL
I’m just glad that’s over and I can
lay down for a minute I’m
exhausted

Sam hops to his feet quickly
SAM
Let’s go for a swim
EXT LITTLE MOHICAN INN (POOL AREA) - LATER
The pool area is completely empty save for Sam and Marshall

There are no women in sight The patio is on top of a small
rocky ledge that overlooks the white sand beaches below

Marshall sits in a rickety wooden pool chair reading his
library book his hair wet from the leaf-filled pool He’s
shirtless in flowered swim trunks

Sam is still fully dressed looking down at the beach through
a pair of old binoculars

MARSHALL
You know it’s funny I’m only on
page thirty-seven but so far it’s
really beautiful I read this book
and I feel like it’s about my life
or something Is that weird

SAMS POV - THROUGH THE BINOCULARS

Wooden tables and chairs are set up along the far end of the
beach A cocktail party is underway The well-dressed guests
from earlier now in pearls and jackets are all barefoot
drinking martinis in the sand Some wear fancy bathing suits
and stand by the shore There must be about seventy guests in
total not counting the large fleet of traditionally-dressed
staff members

Sam scans the crowd in search of something or somebody He
stops on a large cluster of people in a circle

BACK TO SCENE
HOLD ON Sam’s face

SAM
You want to know what I think I
think we need to get out of here
and have ourselves a drink

MARSHALL
Should I get the whiskey from the
room and make us some highballs

SAM
Well save that for later You
wanted to meet women on this trip
right

MARSHALL
Well there might still be girls
here they’re probably just in
their rooms napping or something

Sam puts the binoculars up to Marshalls face

SAM
No one else is here Marshall
There’s a great thing going on down
on the beach And we were
personally invited

MARSHALL
By who

SAM
By our new friend Teddy that’s
who Come on it’d be a little
adventure

Marshall puts the binoculars down

MARSHALL
You think I could just walk over
there in my swim trunks

SAM
Of course not You brought a real
suit though didn’t you

MARSHALL
Yeah You told me to bring one but
I still have to sticky roll it--

SAM
Well let’s get some use out of it

Sam snaps Marshall’s book shut and walks towards the room

EXT BEACH - LATER

Dusk is approaching and the sun is setting over the water
They are both wearing suits Sam’s is brown corduroy with
canvas patches over the elbows Marshall’s is navy with gold
buttons

MARSHALL
How do I know what to say to these
people

SAM

All you have to do is be yourself
Youre rich so you’ll have plenty
to talk to them about Don’t you
remember that time we snuck into
your Dad’s country club

Marshall nods

MARSHALL
I know it’s justI haven’t left
the apartment in a while And I
feel like I’ve gained weight

SAM
Let’s stay focused Marshall Our
goal right now is to find Teddy and
stick with him until we get
acclimated to our surroundings
just sort of peacock around a bit
show ourselves off Then when the
time is right we’ll unleash
ourselves on some of these older
women

MARSHALL
Sounds good

Suddenly Sam stops

SAM
One last thing Feel free to make
shit up about yourself like a job
or something like that

Sam continues on Marshall looks confused

EXT BEACH - LATER

Sam and Marshall jump out from behind some shrubs lining the
beach Sam dusts himself off Marshall looks at him oddly

MARSHALL
Why are we sneaking around like
this if we were invited

SAM
We’re not sneaking around We’re
being mysterious

Just then a waiter carrying a tray of tropical cocktails
with the little umbrellas sticking out walks by Sam grabs
the last two remaining glasses handing one to Marshall

The majority of the guests are far older than the boys in
their thirties and forties Behind them the large white
house from earlier looms in the last remnants of sunlight

In the distance we see Teddy a bit drunker than earlier
wearing a snorkel mask and flippers Other guests look at him
oddly

Sam and Marshall approach him hesitantly

SAM (CONT’D)
Hello Teddy

Teddy turns around He looks completely confused

SAM (CONTD)
Sam and Marshall

A moment of silence Teddy finally gives a smile of
recognition

TEDDY
Shall I show you boys around

MOMENTS LATER

Teddy leads the boys through the party towards the bar
Teddys sense of ownership over the place is clearly an
annoyance to most of the guests

TEDDY
I’m so pleased you boys made it
over to our side of the beach It’s
a bit stuffy over here as it is

SAM
We’re thrilled to be here

Sam’s eyes are wandering all over the party He appears to be
hiding behind Marshall

TEDDY
Well first thing let’s get you
some cocktails that don’t flag the
both of you as couple of
homosexuals

Teddy snaps his fingers Ian stands by the bar drinking from
a bottle

TEDDY (CONT’D)
Ian Prepare something a bit more
masculine for our young friends
here

Ian starts pouring drinks Teddy sticks a cigarette in his
mouth extending the pack towards Sam and Marshall Marshall
is about to decline when

SAM
We’ll just share one of these
thanks

Sam pops one in his mouth as Teddy lights it with some
matches Sam puffs then passes it to Marshall Marshall takes
a puff clearly not inhaling but trying to fit in

Teddy squints eyeing someone in a crowd

TEDDY
You see that girl over there in the
purple scarf She fucked my friend
in the ass with a strap on once
when we were all on ketamine
(beat)
I’1l be right back

And he’s gone leaving the boys alone Sam notices Marshall
watching the Blonde Maid from earlier clear a table

MARSHALL
She’s so beautiful In a sad kind
of way

SAM

Well everyone here is sad
Marshall That’s why we could
really clean up in a place like
this

(beat)
But personally I think you
shouldnt be focused on the maid at
a party like this

Marshall turns and sees a WOMAN WITH DARK GLASSES in a
sundress

MARSHALL
Okay what about that dark haired
one

SAM

She’s perfect She’d be lucky to
have sex with you

She starts to stare at Marshall laughing amongst her small
circle of friends

MARSHALL
I think she’s laughing at us

SAM
That’s what these people do It’s a
mating call We’re the young guys
here Don’t you understand what
kind of power that gives us

The boys stand silent for a moment absorbing the
concentration of wealth and decadence that surrounds them
All of a sudden a wave of discomfort and insecurity washes
over both of their faces

OLD MAN (0S)
No no I think it was a Noel Coward
play that they turned into a film

OTHER OLD PERSON (0S)
I’m afraid I don’t know that one

ANOTHER OLD PERSON (0S)
David Lean was the director I
believe it was called
Briefsomething or other

A proud but desperate look of recognition washes over Sam’s
face as he turns to find a well dressed OLD MAN engaging in
conversation with other rich people

SAM
(interjecting)
Brief Encounter

In one motion the small cluster of tweed and pearls turn to
face Sam and Marshall not expecting such a diatribe

OLD MAN
Excuse me

SAM
That’s the movie you were trying to
think of It was based on Cowards
play ‘Still Life’ from 1936 but
they didn’t make the movie til 45’

Again Sam is trying too hard and no one seems impressed

OLD WOMAN
Who are you

SAM
Oh I’m Sam Davis A published
author of children’s stories and
Marshall over here is an

Sam winks playfully at Marshall

MARSHALL
I don’t have a job actually

Sam looks at Marshall dumbfounded

SAM
(laughs)
He’s joking--

MARSHALL
I’ve been going through a rough
patch lately so I haven’t been
putting myself out there really
But when I doI think I’d like to
be an actor

But Sam’s not paying attention anymore Something in the
distance has caught his eye

AT THE OTHER END OF THE PARTY

We see a tall woman beautiful and befreckled ZOE mid
thirties sips a martini laughing with a group of friends
She’s beautiful with a liveliness that defies her age As
she turns towards Sam her smile shifts suddenly into one of
surprise and confusion She drops her martini glass in the
white sand

BACK TO SCENE

Marshall is still droning on Sam excuses himself totally
distracted

SAM
Excuse me for a moment

CUT TO

Sam and Zoe walk towards each other from opposite ends of the
beach Sam saunters with a false sense of confidence and ease
as opposed to Zoe who seems like she is speeding to
intercept him

ZOE
(whispering)
What the fuck are you doing here

Sam smiles
SAM

I can’t believe how beautiful you
look

ZOE
Answer the question Sam

SAM
What question
(off Zoe’s look)
Your brother invited me

ZOE
I told you not to come

Sam looks her up and down in awe She is slightly taller
then him

SAM
Wow Have you grown since last
spring You seem a bit taller

ZOE
(defiantly)
You don’t know my brother

SAM
Not true actually We met at the
market just up the road He told us
to come and have a drink so I
thought--

ZOE
I told you not to come here

SAM
Excuse me You keep saying that
but when did this happen And where
was I

ZOE
I sent you a postcard

Sam takes a moment Zoe seems deflated
SAM
Is this seriously my “hello” here
Come on I’ve traveled six hours to
see you

Zoes face softens She looks at Sam sweetly

ZOE
Your moustache looks ridiculous

Sam touches his face insecurely

SAM
Oh I forgot I even had it

Just then Teddy walks up handing Sam a large tropical
drink Zoe looks surprised

SAM (CONTD)
Thanks for the drink Teddy

Sam takes a sip winking at Zoe Teddy looks at Zoe
curiously then rubs her head messing up her hair

TEDDY
Sam this is my over-grown sister
Zoe Massive head she’s got hmm

SAM
Yeah you know oddly enough we
happen to know each other But
never until this moment have I ever
noticed just how massive this head
of hers really is

Zoe glares at Sam then Teddy

ZOE
(to Teddy)
Oh youve met Sam then have you
Teddy Sam Davis

As Zoe utters Sam’s name Teddy realizes something His face
changes

TEDDY

Mr Sam Davis

(beat)
Yes Right Sam and I’ve become
good friends now haven’t we

(awkward beat)
Well I’1l go find your friend
Marlon or whatever

Teddy stumbles away awkwardly Zoe looks to Sam

ZOE
You brought a friend

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF PARTY

Marshall continues to converse with the older guests
gesticulating wildly They look more than bored

BACK TO SCENE

SAM
I didn’t have much of a choice
Marshall drives And I had to see
you

Zoe can’t help but smile Sam puts his hand on Zoe’s face
but she swats it away quickly

ZOE
Are you insane You have to leave
immediately I sent that postcard
to warn you

SAM
Warn me About what

MALE VOICE (0S)
There she is

Suddenly a hand grabs Zoe’s shoulder The hand belongs to
WHIT COUTELL a tall lanky gentlemen in a tan suit and
tortoise shell glasses He has a clean-shaven face with a
close-cropped haircut atop his head He holds two champagne
glasses

WHIT
Hey sweetheart we’re just going to
have to snap a few pictures for the
photographer it should only take a
minute

Whit kisses Zoe on the cheek snapping her out of her
reverie Whit looks down at Sam confused

WHIT (CONTD)
Who’s this

Zoe struggles to answer Sam quickly reacts

SAM
(smiles)
Sam Sam Davis Pleased to finally
meet you Whit I’ve heard so much
about you

Zoe looks to Sam a bit surprised Whit doesn’t say anything
for a moment His face shifts to a warm smile of recognition

WHIT
Sam Yes of course

He extends his arms and hugs Sam tightly placing Sam’s head
snuggly in his armpit Whit lets out a sound as they embrace

WHIT (CONT’D)
Finally a chance to meet the
famous Sam Davis What a surprise
I was wondering when I was going to
finally be able to put a face to go
with the stories

Whit looks to Zoe

WHIT (CONTD)
I didn’t know you invited Sam

ZOE
Actually Sam isn’t staying long--

SAM
(interjecting)

Oh she didn’t invite me actually
It was just afluke You see my
best friend and I are staying down
the road We wanted to get away for
the weekend and our hotel happens
to share a beach with yours
soafter we ran into Teddy at the
market we thought we’d stroll over
say and hello

ZOE
It’s all just a lovely coincidence

WHIT
Well it certainly is isn’t it

Whit takes everything in for a moment sizing up Sam up

WHIT (CONT’D)

Jesus You have to forgive me Sam
but by the way Zoe speaks about
you I always sort of imagined
this strapping tallman You
know with all the “Sam sent me
this” and “Sam wrote me that”

(beat)
Anyway if you don’t mind me
saying you’re a lot shorter than I
imagined It’s funny isn’t it

Sam deflects the comment effortlessly He gives Zoe a look

SAM
Well Zoe’s been telling you tall
tales hasn’t she

Beat The joke doesn’t receive the reaction he intended

SAM (CONT’D)
Anyway I tend to grow on people

Whit laughs Sam joins in

WHIT
He is funny
(to Zoe)

You were right

Zoe looks sick she nods Just then a TAN COUPLE approaches
Whit and takes his attention

WHIT (CONT’D)
(ecstatic)
There he is Get over here
Welcome Welcome

Whit kisses both of them warmly

TAN MAN
Congratulations Whit Thanks for
having us You know I forgot to
mention earlier somebody slipped
me that piece about you in The New
Yorker--

While Whit and the Tan Couple engage Sam and Zoe lock
glances He smiles confidently

ZOE
(hushed)
You need to leave

SAM
(hushed)
Why are you whispering

In the background Whit continues

WHIT
Oh come on Hey do me a favor and
go grab a drink but stay close by I
want to talk to you about an idea I
just had Stay close

Whit signals the couple away and gives his attention back to
Sam He puts his arm around Zoe

WHIT (CONT’D)
Sorry for that Bruce is the head
of the “Little Foot” foundation
one of my favorite charities
anyway what was I saying Right
who are you here with Where are
you staying

SAM
My friend Marshall and I are
staying at the Little Mohican Inn
this neat little Native American
motel Great place to go and just
get away from it all

Sam points to far end of the beach where Marshall is still
struggling to entertain the older couple

SAM (CONTD)
That’s him over there Talking to
the oldest people I’ve ever seen

WHIT
Oh he’s gotten in good with my
parents has he

Whit waves his hands towards his parents and Marshall

WHIT (CONTD)
Over here gang

Marshall waves back confused A photographer in glasses taps
Whit on the shoulder

WHIT (CONT’D)
Well listen Sam We’ve got to
take some pictures but to be honest
it seems like a waste for you and
Marvin to stay in that Indian rat
trap all the way across the beach
when we’ve got this house to
ourselves

ZOE
Oh Whit I’m not sure we have the
space with everyone in from out of--

WHIT
No no I’m sure we can find an
extra room somewhere It’s rare that
we get the whole gang in the
countryside to celebrate such a
(looks fondly at Zoe)
Special occasion

Zoe opens her mouth to contest but Sam cuts her off

SAM
What exactly are we celebrating

Whit looks to Zoe confused

WHIT
Have you not told him the good
news

Sam appears totally oblivious He stares at Zoe confused
Zoe avoids Sam’s look unable to answer

SAM
No She hasn’t Zoe please Tell
me the good news

WHIT
Zoe and I are getting married on
Sunday

Several guests standing around clap politely and fawn over
the lovely couple Sam appears totally oblivious an odd
expression on his face He shifts his attention to Zoe

SAM
Really This Sunday

EXT BEACH - MOMENTS LATER
Sam storms towards Marshall a determined look on his face

Marshall is flirting with the attractive Lady in Dark
Glasses She’s very drunk Marshall lifts his hair pointing
to something on the top of his forehead As Sam nears
Marshall we can hear their the tail end of their
conversation

MARSHALL
-that’s where they got me
(points to other side)
And the restwell it’s alla
blur really

Before he can go further Sam pulls Marshall aside taking
him towards the sea

MARSHALL (CONTD)
How was I doing back there
SAM
I thought we made an agreement to
lie about ourselves

MARSHALL
Who were those people you were
talking to I thought I recognized
that man from a magazine--

SAM
Oddly enough those were some
friends of mine that happen to be
staying here for the weekend
(beat)
I’ve told you about my friend Zoe
haven’t I

Marshall shakes his head

SAM (CONTD)
Doesn’t matter Anyway I think we
should check out of the Mohican and
check in here

He points to the large white house bearing down on them

MARSHALL
Honestly

SAM
Yeah Honestly We were extended
the invitation and I think we ought
to take it

MARSHALL
But I sort of like the Mohican
It’s got a lot of character

SAM

Okay first of all people only say
that about things that are terrible
when they’re trying to be nice

(beat)
Second our room’s a shoebox
Marshall and it smells like
gunpowder Our accommodations here
would be twice as spacious and we’d
at least have a working shower and
some closet space

(pause)
Take a look around

Marshall does so The guests all talk amongst themselves
blatantly ignoring Sam and Marshall

SAM (CONTD)
Everyone wants to know who we are
Especially that one

Sam points to the Lady in Dark Glasses

MARSHALL
Her name is Esme

SAM
Of course it is And I’m sure that
sad maid is around here somewhere
Those are two real possibilities
We’re not going to get a deal like
that at the Mohican

Marshall still looks unsure

MARSHALL
I just feel like you and I wouldn’t
get to spend as much time together
if we stayed here This weekend is
supposed to be about you and me

SAM
And it still is We’re just going
to improvise a little okay

Sam eyes Zoe in the distance Whits arm tightly around her
whilst simultaneously shaking hands Zoe notices Sam’s gaze
turning for a moment a sad expression in her eyes Sam turns
back to Marshall

SAM (CONTD)
Are you with me or what

EXT HOUSE - DAY

Sam and Marshall drag their luggage up to the front of the
massive white house Marshall’s old Mercedes sticks out badly
amidst the nicer cars in the background

SAM
and remember don’t feel like
you have to explain everything to
everyone all the time It makes you
seem a little pathetic And you’re
not pathetic are you

MARSHALL
I’m not pathetic

SAM
No of course you’re not I’m just
saying let’s not be afraid to use
a little subtlety here and there

The boys now stand at the massive double doors looking
exhausted and a bit confused Sam knocks dramatically No
answer

Sam begins pulling on the door’s handles with a bizarre sense
of urgency

SAM (CONTD)
Why is this door locked

Just then the doors open revealing Teddy his arms crossed
a cigarette dangling from his lips Behind him we see the
FOYER of the house The decor is much like an old seaboard
hotel from the seventies with sanded wooden floors Lived in
but not worse for wear A large staircase in the middle of
the house goes up three floors

TEDDY
Hello friends

INT SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY

Teddy leads the boys down a narrow hallway lined with framed
pictures and movie posters

TEDDY
This whole weekend was as much of a
surprise to me as anyone

SAM
I can imagine The whole thing
feels pretty thrown together

TEDDY
Youre telling me I had to hop on
a plane directly from my work

SAM
What is it that you do Teddy

TEDDY
I like to build things

Teddy begins walking again Sam follows Marshall lags
behind He stops to examine some of the pictures on the wall

The photographs are stills from various documentary film
shoots

The focus of each is Whit performing various directing
duties On stage with Cuban musicians in a rundown Havana
music hall A picture of him laughing hysterically with
Werner Herzog in a rain forrest clearing Lunching with a
collection of Kentucky coal miners Playing chess with the
Dalai Lama in Tibet

TEDDY (OS) (CONT’D)
Well here we are

Teddy stops at the last door on the right and opens it
INT BOY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The door opens revealing a tiny cramped bedroom It looks
like it’s currently being used as some sort of storage room
The wallpaper is old and flowery and the tiny wrought iron
bed could barely fit one person A small gift basket rests
atop it

Sam walks in first with optimistic enthusiasm Marshall seems
a bit unsure Teddy follows holding some of Marshall’s
luggage There is barely enough room to set everything down

SAM
Ha This is perfect

TEDDY
I suppose it’s a bit cozy isn’t
it

SAM
That’s no problem for us

Sam wipes the sweat off his brow Just then an overweight
tabby cat scampers out from the bathroom and into the
hallway

MARSHALL
Who’s cat is that

TEDDY
Olivia belongs to my sister
(ignores)
More importantly it’s imperative I
take your shoes with me

MARSHALL
Pardon

TEDDY
No shoes this weekend Per my
sister’s request

(MORE )

TEDDY (CONTD)
They’1l stay in the laundry room
until after wedding

Sam takes off his shoes and hands them to Teddy Marshall is
a bit more reluctant

TEDDY (CONT’D)
Don’t fret Marshall I haven’t
worn shoes since we landed

Marshall looks down Teddys feet are filthy and bloody
Marshall gathers several pairs of leather shoes from his
suitcase and hands them hesitantly to Teddy

TEDDY (CONTD)
Youll have to excuse my sister’s
romantic view of reality But when
she makes a request we all have to
listen don’t we It’s her weekend
isn’t it

And Teddy is gone closing the door behind him Marshall
looks around uneasy Sam unbuttons his collar

MARSHALL
It’s so hot in here

Marshall tugs the cord of the ceiling fan but the string
just breaks off

INT BOY’S ROOM - LATER

Sam looks out the bay windows The sun has nearly set and
many of the barefoot weekenders are heading towards a large

dinner table being set nearby

Marshall enters from the bathroom a towel around his waist
and one around his head like a turban

MARSHALL
The cat shit in our bathtub And
there’s no hot water either
Marshall lays down on the tiny bed looking uncomfortable
SAM
Isn’t this bed great We can sleep
head to toe

MARSHALL
Did you know that I’m in therapy

Sam is caught off-guard

SAM
What Really
MARSHALL
Yeah I just thought you should
know that
A moment
SAM

Jesus Christ Marshall Next time
you tell someone something like
that you should wait for a more
opportune time or something You
know rather then justblurting
it out like that

(beat)
Is it working

MARSHALL
Yes and no

Sam looks at Marshall with genuine concern

SAM
Well I’m sorry to hear that

Marshall inspects the gift basket on the bed He sifts
through a few records a book of short stories and poems
some bubble bath marmalade and a Marx Brothers DVD A
little note attached plainly reads Thank you for being a
part of this Love Z

MARSHALL
You think everyone got one of these
gift baskets or just us

Sam stares at the note His face grows emotional

SAM
Well I should have my shower now

Sam picks up his toiletry bag and walks into the bathroom
closing the door The shower turns on shortly after

SAM (0S) (CONTD)
(screaming)
Ha This water’s exhilarating

Marshall begins digging through a leather handbag removing
the small manuscript from which Sam was reading earlier On
the cover page “The Affair of the Pearl Hunter” Underneath
this it says “words and pictures by Sam Davis”

Marshall notices Sam’s glasses sitting on the night stand He
tries them on At first he squints then opens his eyes wide
appearing to see completely clearly

MARSHALL
(calling out)
Hey Sam we have the same
prescription

No response Marshall flips through manuscript looking at
some of the pictures

He looks over to a shelf where there are two framed pictures
One of Whit standing on a cliff his scarf blowing in the
wind and one of Zoe holding her knees on a picnic blanket

Back to the book The mermaid and merman look eerily similar
to Zoe and Whit

MARSHALL (CONTD)
How did you meet Zoe again

SAM (0S)
What Can’t hear you Marshall
INT BATHROOM - LATER
Through the steam Sam stares in the mirror with shaving
cream all over his face
INT MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Whit lies napping spread out over white sheets in his king-
sized bed with an eye mask covering his face

In the background we hear another shower running

INT MASTER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Zoe has her head under the water her wet blonde hair forming
a curtain around her face Her eyes are open deep in
thought

INT FOYER - NIGHT

Marshall and Sam hurry down the grand staircase barefoot
They are dressed in suits looking sharp The house is empty

EXT GARDEN - NIGHT

An extremely long banquet table set up on the veranda filled
with the weekends guests illuminated by hundreds of Chinese
lanterns that hang from the trees

Sam and Marshall sit alongside Teddy at the foot of the
table the section clearly reserved for outsiders and third
uncles Marshall seems somewhat entertained Sam takes large
sips of his whiskey visibly anxious attempting to listen in
on various conversations around him

PARTY GUEST 4
The whole house looks absolutely
gorgeous You know he paid for all
this himself

PARTY GUEST 5
My impression was that the bride’s
family was supposed to take care of
all that

PARTY GUEST 6
Well we all know Whit I don’t
know much about her family To tell
you the truth I think it’s just
her and that brother

Sam looks away annoyed He stares at Zoe and Whit who sit at
the opposite end Zoe is in a green-flowered dress Whit has

her in a tight embrace They are chatting it up with another

well dressed couple

WHIT
You know when I first asked Zoe out
she laughed in my face

Zoe nudges him smiling

ZOE
I wouldn’t quite use the term
laughed But--

WHIT
My hand to God I hounded her For
at least a month Following her
everywhere dropping roses off at
her door step literally begging
her day and night to come to dinner
with me Keep in mind she had pink
hair during this period

Just then we hear the CLINKING of a glass signifying a
toast Everyone turns to find Teddy struggling to stand up
holding his glass in the air

TEDDY
Can everyone shut up please

Teddy continues to tap his glass with a butter knife
eventually shattering it all over himself

TEDDY (CONTD)
Ah I can see Whit brought out the
good crystal

(awkward pause)
Alright I’d just like to say
congratulations Congratulations to
my trouble making cunt of a sister
Zoewhom I love
deeplysocheers to her It’s
truly an oddity to see her finally
settling down Especially for you
knowWhit

Zoe laughs at Teddy affectionately from across the table
Marshall laughs too catching glimpses of Esme from across
the table who is sitting next to a HEAVY MAN with salt and
pepper hair in a tweed coat She steals glances at Marshall
He turns to Sam noticing his moustache is gone

MARSHALL
(whisper )
Did you shave off your moustache

Sam looks straight ahead

SAM

I look better without it
MARSHALL

You were so proud of it though
SAM

I’m listening to Teddy’s speech

Marshall
Sam downs another glass of whiskey

TEDDY
Id like to pay my respects to uh
Whit as well First because he
never fails to pick up the bill or
my airplane tickets And second
for taking care of Zoe

(MORE )

TEDDY (CONTD)
I know she’s not the easiest and
certainly ismercurial by nature

Whit smiles and laughs

TEDDY (CONTD)

It’s a lovely thing you two tying
the knot after all these years of
speculation We were all starting
to fear Whit might be a bithmm
hmmand my sis was some elaborate
beard or something I’m kidding
I’m sure he’s got a strong healthy
cock if Zoe’s stayed with him this
long

(long beat)
Right well anyway cheers
everyone

Some uncomfortable laughter from the table Whit looks less
than flattered but smiles nonetheless Zoe finds the whole
thing hysterical

Whit stands up quickly a glass of champagne in his hand

WHIT
Well thank you Teddy Your candor
is always very much appreciated I
love you too

Some laughter Teddy sits down muttering something under his
breath All eyes are on Whit but Sam hasn’t turned away from
Zoe She notices Sam staring and motions for him to look at
Whit

WHIT (CONTD)
I’m going to make this quick if
it’s alright with you I’m not one
for speeches but

Some polite chuckles from the crowd Marshall notices a small
film crew setting up in the corner Just then a LIGHT flips
on and shines on Whit

WHIT (CONT’D)
(confused)
Oh Should I start over
(beat)
I’m going to make this quick if
it’s alright with you I’m not one
for speeches but

MARSHALL
Are they filming this

SAM
Probably

WHIT

Id just like to thank all of you
for being here with us in one of my
favorite places in the world on a
very special weekend

(beat)
You know when you’ve spent your
last few months sleeping in a
thatched hut in the Congo you
really learn to appreciate things
like a decent shower and a good
cheeseburger

(pause for laughter)
You learn to appreciate being home
Around your family Around your
friends Around the people that are
the most dear to you

He looks down at Zoe A dramatic beat

WHIT (CONT’D)

Id be a lying if I didn’t say
that loving you has been the one
of greatest adventures of my life
which is saying quite a lot

(beat)
And believe me when I say that
forcing you to finally marry me has
been the greatest accomplishment
Besides the Oscar Just kidding I
love you Zoe

He bends down and kisses Zoe deeply then raises his glass

WHIT (CONT’D)
A toast to you all To my family
to my old friends

Everyone at the table raises a glass visibly moved

WHIT (CONTD)
»and to new ones

Whit smiles and directs his glass to Sam and Marshall at the
end of table Guests turn to face them Suddenly Sam stands
glass in hand interrupting Whit’s speech Whit seems caught
off guard Some murmurs from the crowd

SAM
Cheers Whit Cheers Zoe Uh it’s
quite a strange coincidence sharing
the beach with you this weekend
And I know I speak for Marshall and
myself when I say coincidence or
not it’s truly a pleasure to be
here for thisbeautiful pairing
of two souls about to embark on
along journey together Really
youre just a perfectly attractive
coupleso tan

Sam trails off Zoe looks concerned

SAM (CONTD)
Thanks so much for having us And
yes to new friends and old ones

Sam winks at Zoe Marshall and Zoe are looking at Sam like
he’s crazy Zoe mouths “What the fuck are you doing”

SAM (CONT’D)
Whit you’re a lucky man And
Zoe

Sam turns and stares at Zoe straight in the eye He holds her
gaze for a long moment

SAM (CONTD)
Whits a lucky man

The crowd gives him a surprisingly generous laugh Whit
smiles just a bit eyeing Sam and Zoe curiously

SAM (CONT’D)
Now if you’1ll just excuse me for a
moment
Sam backs away from the table and heads towards the woods
Marshall and Zoe look concerned People clap looking pleased
but a bit confused

RANDOM GUEST (0S)
Who the fuck was that
EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Sam is leaning against a tree throwing up violently
Finally he stops and just stands there panting

Marshall walks up behind him

MARSHALL
Are you feeling alright

Sam turns around surprised He wipes his mouth trying to
seem upbeat

SAM

Oh hi Marshall That’s sweet of
you to come and check up on me
Don’t worry I’m fine Just a bad
case of food poisoning I think

(laughs awkwardly)
Youd think with all the money this
guy’s worth they could serve some
decent food

Beat

MARSHALL

You didn’t touch any of your

dinner
SAM

What are you a detective
MARSHALL

Are you drunk You smell like

whiskey
An odd moment of silence

SAM
Actually that’s probably it I
drank on an empty stomach You have
any of that salmon jerky left in
your bag Ill just go up and
refuel and then I’1l1 be good as
new

Marshall takes the small package out of his breast pocket and
hands it to Sam He eats some

SAM (CONT’D)
There That’s better
(claps his hands)
Alright see you out there

Marshall doesn’t move
MARSHALL

Did you and Zoe everhave a thing
together

SAM
What does that mean What’s a
“thing” Marshall

MARSHALL
She just looks at you strangely all
the time And you start breathing
differently whenever she’s around--

SAM
No it’s not like that

Marshall gives Sam a look

SAM (CONTD)
Listen to me We made a deal to
enjoy ourselves and get you
acclimated to the real world

Sam puts his arm around Marshall Marshall seems skeptical

MARSHALL
No of course I agree I totally
agree but I was justflipping
through your story again andit’s
justthere’s a lot of
similarities--

SAM
Have you ever written anything
before Marshall

MARSHALL
Well once--

SAM
Right well let me tell you about
what writers do okay We like to
make up thingsamalgams okay
And what is an amalgam They’re
characters that are based on
several people and places and
things just sort of mixed together
into one thing Now Zoe up there I
find extremely interesting and
beautiful but she’s just part of a
bigger whole okay Part of that
mermaid you met So the female
character in that particular story
isn’t necessarily her It’s a
mixture of a lot of different
girls Sort of like scrambled eggs
in a way Are you still with me

MARSHALL
So Chloe the mermaid isn’t--

SAM
Chloe the mermaid is not Zoe the
person no Not even close Shes
just eggs Okay

A beat Marshall seems a bit skeptical

MARSHALL
Just eggs
(beat)
With an English accent

SAM
Exactly

Sam claps his hands They start walking back up the trail
towards the house

MARSHALL
(concerned)
I’m having a difficult time
articulating exactly what my fear
is but it’s really present right
now I mean I trust you--

SAM
Then loosen up alright
(beat)
How’s my breath

Sam breathes into Marshall’s face A beat

MARSHALL
You should brush your teeth

Longer beat

SAM
Thank you for always being so
honest

INT BOY’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Sam brushes his teeth staring at himself in the mirror He
spits out the remainder of toothpaste and continues to stare
for a long moment He looks like he could cry But he
doesn’t

INT MAIN HALLWAY - NIGHT

Faint music drifts through the house bouncing off of the
cracked walls The antique grand chandelier rattles softly
with the bass There is no one in sight Sam creeps down the
large staircase

SAM
Hello

No one responds VOICES coming from the LIVING ROOM
Sam pokes his head through the large double doors
SAM’S POV INSIDE THE LIVING ROOM

Whit is standing in the center of a large oak room an old
pull-down movie screen behind him There is a captive
audience in front of him sitting on antique sofas in fold-
up chairs and on the floor Bottles of wine blankets
cigarettes and food trays are strewn about

WHIT

Now I don’t normally do this but
I thought that while I had you all
together I could give you a sneak
peek at what I’ve been up to I
figured rather then returning all
those calls and emails explaining
my adventures I could just show
you And raise some awareness

(beat)
I’ve also left you some
questionnaires for you to fill out
afterwards Totally optional

Sam scans the crowd through the haze of cigarette smoke and
finds Zoe bundled up in a cashmere afghan on the floor
surrounded by friends Whit whirls his hand in the air

WHIT (CONTD)
Let’s roll the film

Whit sits in his leather armchair He whispers something into
Zoes ear

The lights go black and the projector begins running scenes
from his newest documentary about the Congo We see various
shots of Whit interviewing African guerillas Participating
in ceremonies Shots of Whit rushing women and children to
safety as a small village burns down

Whit watches satisfied and moved Zoe tries to seem
entertained like she hasn’t seen all this before She stands
and sneaks towards an exit at the opposite end of the room

Sam follows her with his eyes and disappears from the
doorway rushing to intercept her

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Zoe exits the living room when Sam appears from out of
nowhere grabbing her suddenly She jumps

ZOE
What the--

Before she can finish Sam pulls her into a nearby closet

INT CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

Sam and Zoe’s faces are within inches of each other The
cramped coat closet is filled with sailing equipment and
other nautical contraptions

ZOE
(whispering)
--fuck is the matter with you

Sam kisses her pulling the chain for the light bulb turning
it OFF We hear sounds of scuffling and resistance

Immediately the lights turn back ON Zoe’s hand is on the
chain She looks flustered

ZOE (CONT’D)
Have you completely lost your mind

Some orange life jackets tumble down from the top shelf Sam
throws them off him in a fit

SAM
Maybe

Sam kisses her again She is less resistant this time Sam
pulls the chain The room goes dark

Zoe turns it on again She keeps one hand on the chain and
slaps Sam in the face with the other He’s shocked

ZOE
This stays on

Sam calms down a bit holding his face

SAM
Okayokay
(beat)
I’ve never actually been slapped
before It kind of hurts

ZOE
I’m sorry I didn’t mean to do it so
hard
(pause)

Why did you shave off your pathetic
little moustache

SAM
(sadly)
Because you told me to

Zoe softens for a moment

A moment

Zoe huffs

ZOE
What are you still doing here Sam
I sent you that postcard to avoid
these types of dramatics

SAM
Well maybe sending postcards isn’t
the best way to alert people of
heart-shattering information in the
modern world

ZOE
I left you a message too

Sam thinks

SAM
My phone was shut off

Calming down

ZOE
What exactly is your objective
here

SAM

It would seem like I’m in the
process of winning you back

ZOE
May I reiterate that I’m getting
married in two days I’m engaged
Sam I’ve always been engaged

SAM
Yeah but I never thought you’d
actually go through with it When
did this all happen anyway

ZOE
I was just as shocked about it as
you were Whit thought it would be
a nice surprise to move the wedding
to this weekend while we had
everyone in one place Without
asking me

SAM
That’s some goddamn surprise isn’t
it
(beat)
Jesus I had this whole weekend
planned out All our time budgeted
so we could meet in the woods and--

ZOE
It’s not like it would’ve been so
easy for me to just sneak away even
if it was a holiday Sam His whole
family is here Surprise wedding or
not It was a stupid plan to begin
with

SAM
You can’t possibly think this guy’s
a real option for you He screens
his movie at his own rehearsal
dinner You’re going to be giving
birth to at child and he’1l be
showing the doctor footage of him
giving those Africans piggy back
rides

ZOE
For your information he was saving
those Africans from a burning
village

SAM
Yeah well only because they were
his film crew
(pause)
The man doesn’t have a single hair
on his chest

ZOE
You’re behaving like a child

SAM
So are you

Zoe sighs frustrated

ZOE
Look Sam Be reasonable here Why
not go home and save yourself the
torture Or if you do intend to
stay and make my life more
difficult at least introduce
yourself to one of the lovely young
girls here I’m sure they’re all
just as desperate as you to get
their rocks off

SAM
(wounded )
How could you say something like
that

ZOE
I meant it in the least offensive
way possible

Zoe looks down then walks out She is halfway out the door
when she turns

ZOE (CONT’D)
And stop standing on your fucking
toes Sam I like you how you are

Sam lowers himself to his proper height Zoe turns off the
light and closes the door behind her Sam stands in the
darkness for a moment gathering his thoughts

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Sam walks into the kitchen The room is huge covered in
exposed brick and several wood-burning ovens Some of the
younger people at the party are wearing costumes and
drinking Teddy Ian and Marshall are sitting at the
breakfast table with bowls of cereal and funny hats on

TEDDY
Look who it is Welcome back Sam
(beat)
You feeling alright

Sam suddenly infuses himself with energy

SAM
Yeah I feel great

IAN
How about a funny hat for our
friend Sam

Teddy places a chicken hat on Sam’s head

TEDDY
And how about a pill to go with
your chicken hat

Teddy extends a little plastic baggie filled with colored
pills

TEDDY (CONTD)
We convinced sweet Marshall to
indulge Thought it would quiet the
voices in his head for a bit

Marshall looks up at Sam eyes glazed

MARSHALL
My heart feels like it’s metal
SAM
Nice to see you loosening up a bit
(to Teddy)

What are these like muscle
relaxants or something

TEDDY
I’m not a fucking doctor mate

Sam looks out the kitchen windows

SAMS POV ON THE VERANDA
Whit and Zoe entertain a several guests drinking martinis
BACK TO SCENE

SAM
How many does it usually take

TEDDY
Maybe four orsix depending on
the nightand my agility

Marshall and Ian are engaged in a heated conversation nearby
A Monopoly board is set up in front of them

MARSHALL
No I’d be the thimble

IAN
You look more like a boot quite
honestly

Marshall laughs a little too loudly

SAM
(re Marshall)
Ill take one less than he had

Teddy hands Sam a single pill from the bag Sam swallows it

SAM (CONTD)
And how long till I feel the
effects

INT BALLROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Sam and Marshall are dancing uninhibited in the middle of the
party Marshall wears oversized sunglasses and Sam is still
wearing his chicken hat Both have lit cigarettes in their
mouths

MARSHALL
(yelling)
I feel like I can’t stop moving

Sam nods caught in the music but still swiveling his head
around the party which is a bit rowdier now

SAM
What’s the quickest possible way we
could get another cigarette into my
mouth

Marshall checks his pockets but they seem to be empty Sam
throws his cigarette down on the black and white tiled floor
and takes the lit cigarette out of Marshall’s mouth

People dance around Sam and Marshall drinking from champagne
bottles smoking and laughing A few of the bridesmaids don
cheap plastic tiaras The men wear sunglasses and hats A
couple drunkenly makes-out on top of the piano surrounded by
balloons Teddy is wrapped in Christmas lights setting off
firecrackers with Ian

Marshall notices Esme dancing with a group of friends
stealing glances in his direction

MARSHALL
I think she’s staring at me What
do I do

Sams eyes have drifted over to the
KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Where Zoe and Whit are gathered surrounded by friends Whit
is dancing unabashedly wearing Groucho Marx glasses and
holding light sticks It provokes uncomfortable laughter from
Zoe
Zoe turns towards the ballroom noticing Sam
BACK TO SCENE
Just then Esme dances up to Sam and Marshall
ESME
Ahoy Marshmallow Do you know how

to cha-cha

Esme wraps a scarf around Marshall’s neck and leads him away
They begin dancing closely

Sam can’t stop staring at Zoe and Whit Whit kisses her on
the nose lovingly while talking to some other people

Sam looks to his left noticing a mildly-attractive Irish
girl MARGARET sitting alone on a stool next to the bathroom
She wears a tiger-print leotard under her pea coat looking
around awkwardly clearly wanting someone to talk to her

CUT TO

Sam saunters up to Margaret playing it casual Margaret
looks up and smiles politely

SAM
Hi

MARGARET
Hello

A beat Sam takes out a bottle of whiskey from his coat

SAM
You want some

MARGARET
No thanks I’m alright

SAM
Maybe you misunderstood me I was
talking about the whiskey

Margaret smiles Sam pours a bit of whiskey in her glass

SAM (CONT’D)
Don’t you worry The farther down
this goes the more sexually
attractive I get

Margaret takes his drink

MARGARET
You sure about that

SAM
(smiling)
No Not really Cheers

They clink glasses

INT KITCHEN - LATER

Sam shows Margaret how to play quarters at the table both of
them far drunker than before She laughs at everything he
says We can barely hear anything being said over the music

Margaret concentrates bouncing the quarter and missing the
glass entirely She laughs hysterically

FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM

Zoe watches Sam and Margaret interact clearly bothered She
turns back to Whit and her friends forcing a smile

INT BALLROOM - LATER

A disco ball hangs duct-taped to the ceiling A few people
are passed out in chairs while some are slow dancing in the
middle of the room The couple is still making-out on top of
the piano

Marshall and Esme are leaning against the wall in mid-
conversation Esme looks bored out of her mind

MARSHALL

Honestly it’s crazy out there you
know One day you’re walking down
the street and some guy in a jump
suit asks you for the time Then
the next thing you know I’m laying
on a hospital bed in Lenox Hill
with blood all over my sport coat

(beat)
Have you never been pistol whipped
before

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM

Sam sits on a couch with Margaret talking quietly He
whispers something in her ear and she smiles looking around
She stands up grabbing his hand leading him towards the
French doors that open up to the backyard

Sam turns back towards the kitchen as we ramp into SLOW-MO

Zoe is watching them go She locks eyes with Sam for what
feels like a long moment

and then he disappears outside Zoe looks down then away
Marshall is still rambling to Esme

MARSHALL (CONTD)
Let’s just kiss Right now

Marshall moves in but Esme turns her head

MARSHALL (CONTD)
I was just kidding

The Heavy Man from earlier walks up and puts his hand on
Esme’s shoulder He pushes Marshall aside

Esme walks away Marshall just stands there uncomfortably

INT BOY’S ROOM - NIGHT

The boys are lying head-to-toe in the tiny bed Both are
sweating profusely their eyes tired and bloodshot They
stare up at the ceiling fan which is still motionless

Sam suddenly stands up on the bed spinning the fan
aggressively He lies back down watching as the fan spins a
few times then slows to a stop

MARSHALL
I just feel so sad
(beat)
Howd things go with your girl

SAM
With Margaret Not bad actually
We had sex Twice Back to back

MARSHALL
Twice Wow How was it You
knowon pills

SAM
Frankly I think we should just
forget about the pills from now on
(beat)
Howd things go with yours

A long moment of silence

MARSHALL
She has a husband
(sighs )
I think she used me

SAM
Well it’s her loss She’d be lucky
to have you

MARSHALL
Yeah I guess it could be worse

Sam stares up at the ceiling

SAM
Why do you think she’s with him
anyway

MARSHALL

I don’t know that much about her--

SAM
No I was talking about Zoe How
could she be with Whit

Marshall turns over on his side

MARSHALL
Oh I don’t know I’m sure it has
something do with her father My
therapist says lots of things can
be explained that way

SAM
Well her parents died when she was
young She’s practically an orphan
I’m sure that’s damaged her
judgement in some way

MARSHALL
She seems like the type of woman
that needs to feel taken care of
And Whit clearly does that I mean
look around
(beat)
(MORE )
Sam reaches for a stack of magazines on the night stand He

MARSHALL (CONTD)
He’s handsome too In a classical
sort of way

grabs a copy of American Documentarian and holds it up

The cover shows Whit wearing a red turtle neck pulled up to

his nose with his eyes opened wide An outline of the
continent of Africa is behind him The headline reads
COUTELL HEART OF DARKNESS” Sam points at the picture

SAM
You honestly find this manthis
man right here with the red
turtle neck up to his eyes
attractive

Marshall examines the picture seriously

MARSHALL
I do Yeah He seems really
concerned with topical issues as

well--

SAM
Well maybe you should just marry
him

MARSHALL

Now you just seem jealous

SAM
I had sex tonight Why should I be
jealous

A light KNOCK on the door

The
the
She

Sam

SAM (CONTD)
Hello

door creaks open Sam looks down to see Zoe crawling on
floor in a sleeping bag Olivia the cat by her side
peeks her head over the side of the bed A beat

ZOE
Hi

turns to Marshall

SAM
Do you still consider me your best
friend

MARSHALL
What

SAM
I need you to take a bath

MARSHALL
But there’s no hot water--

SAM
It’s the middle of summer

Sam half-pushes Marshall out of the bed He grabs the bubble
bath formula and shuffles into the bathroom shutting the
door behind him The water starts running

Zoe stands still in the sleeping bag She and Sam stare at
each other for a moment She hops over to a nearby record
player and puts on the 45’ that was in the boys’ gift basket
Sam notices her clutching some sheets of yellow lined
notebook paper and a pencil in one hand

ZOE
(re Marshall)
Is he going to be alright in there

SAM
Of course Marshall loves baths
(beat)
He’s my sidekick

ZOE
I heard he had a rough time with
Esme Apparently he told her some
dreadful story about being robbed
or something

SAM
Yeah sometimes Marshall doesn’t
know when to shut the fuck up

Zoe climbs into the bed

ZOE
I’m staying in my sleeping bag so
don’t try anything

SAM
You smell like whiskey Are you
drunk

ZOE
It looked like you and Margaret
were hitting it off quite nicely
Did it end well for you two

SAM
It did Twice actually

Zoe tries to play it cool

ZOE
Oh really And how was she

SAM
She wasvery responsive

ZOE
Well she’d better be She’s had
loads of practice
(pause)
She’s practically a whore

SAM
You know you sound awfully jealous
for a woman who’s about to get
married

A quiet moment Zoe looks up at the broken fan

ZOE SAM
I meant to have that thing You’re making a huge mistake
fixed--

ZOE
I’ve made plenty of mistakes Which
specific one are you referring to

SAM
Well you marrying Emperor Nero
down there for starters

ZOE
(sighs )
Must you make the few stolen
moments we do have so incredibly
exhausting It’s like I’m
constantly trapped inside a Bergman
film with you or something

Zoe notices Sam’s book sitting on the night stand She
admires the cover
ZOE (CONTD)
Is that your newest one Why
havent I read this

SAM
I’m still workshopping it I can
give you a synopsis though

ZOE
(smile)
Please do

Sam thinks a moment

SAM
It’s about a deep sea diver who’s
searching for pearls on the ocean
floor where he meets and falls in
love with this mermaid who is
previously engaged

ZOE
Is she an older mermaid

SAM

Significantly but anyway our
diver falls in love with this
mermaid who’s involved ina
fraudulent vapid relationship with
a megalomaniacal arguably gay
merman You knowcomplete
sociopath Anyway our hero has to
battle this merman for the
mermaid’s hand There’s a big fight
scene at the end Sea horses
octopi

(beat)
I’m not sure how it all ends yet

ZOE
You really think children will like
this story Sam

SAM
Probably not

ZOE
It sounds quite original though
Certainly a big step up from the
one about the two caterpillars

SAM
Thanks
Sam looks down noticing that Zoe is still clutching the
notebook paper

SAM (CONT’D)
What are you working on

ZOE
They’re supposed to be my vows but
they’re all blank Thought you
could help me with them

Zoe smiles up at him coyly Sam stares at her for a long
moment then sits up

SAM
Alright Where should we start

ZOE
That’s what I asked you

SAM
Well what exactly do you like
about him

Zoe thinks

ZOE
Let’s see
(beat)
He’s not afraid to be himself

SAM
I can see that What else

ZOE
Umhe makes me feel safe He’s
extremely successful and handsome

SAM
Okayyeah Keep going

ZOE
He’s verystrong-willed

SAM
Right Okay this is goodso
let’s write this down He’s not
afraid to be himself clearly I
mean nobody who dances like that
could possibly be self-conscious
Just completely uninhibited

ZOE
I can tell you’re not going to be
much help with this

SAM
No no no Let’s keep going

Sam holds up a copy of Cineast Monthly magazine Whit is on
the cover posing as Jesus on the cross The headline reads
SAVIOR OF AMERICAN FILM

SAM (CONTD)
I mean how could you not feel safe
and secure with a guy like this

Zoe sighs

SAM (CONTD)
And as far as being strong-willed
goesit’s great for you because
youll never have to make another
decision for yourself ever again
So you can sort of switch off for
the next fifty years or so

ZOE
Now youre just being an asshole

Silence They lay there silently and still Sam looks down

SAM
Your hands are getting old

ZOE
Oh shut up

Sam leans in and kisses Zoe This time she doesn’t resist

INT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Marshall sits in the bathtub covered in bubbles leaning his
ear to the door listening He leans back into the tub and
dips his head under the water slowly

INT BOY’S ROOM - MORNING

The sun shines through the closed green shutters Sam lies
asleep in the sleeping bag but he’s alone Sam’s eyes open

INT BOY’S BATHROOM - MORNING

Marshall is asleep in the bathtub Most of the bubbles have
evaporated

Sam sits fully dressed on the toilet pouring two shots of
Irish whiskey into paper cups

Marshall stirs and jolts forward realizing where he slept
then quickly inspects his hands which are pruney and
indented

MARSHALL
Have you been watching me sleep

Sam extends one of the cups to Marshall

SAM
We had a rough night didn’t we
How’s your head

Marshall sips from the cup

MARSHALL
Well I think the water absorbed
most of the toxins that were
running through my body so that’s
good
(beat)
What happened last night With Zoe

SAM
What about her

MARSHALL
I was listening through the door

Marshall stares at him

SAM
How much did you hear

MARSHALL
Almost everything

Sam sighs leaning back against the wall with guilty eyes

SAM
I’m not sure I’ve been completely
honest with you regarding the
wholeyou know Zoe of it all
(beat)
(MORE )

SAM (CONTD)
She and Iwe did have a thing
together but it wasn’t an
emotional thing It was just the
sort of thing that happened once
randomly and then kept happening

MARSHALL
That’s what I figured

SAM
I know you did I just want to make
it extremely clear to you that
although I did have previous
knowledge that Zoe would be here
this weekend I only found out
after I had made it my mission to
get you feeling good again And
that’s still what this is about I
just figured I could kill two birds
with one stone Reconnect with you
during the day then once you went
to bed I could come and meet Zoe
and mess around with her in the
woods or something But let me
perfectly clear I have no feelings
for her whatsoever

Marshall continues to stare at Sam skeptically

SAM (CONTD)
And I swear to you we never
would’ve come over to this goddamn
beach in the first place if I had
known there was going to be a
wedding

MARSHALL
So what are we still doing here

Sam takes a breath

SAM
I just need a few hours to
officially break things off with
Zoe and give her my blessing on all
this and by nightfall you and I
will be in our room together at the
Mohican playing cards

Marshall still seems a bit hesitant Sam stands up abruptly
snapping his fingers together

SAM (CONT’D)
Why don’t you grab yourself a quick
power nap I’ll have them whip you
up some eggs downstairs

Sam turns to leave

MARSHALL
Can’t we just get out of here now

He stops and turns around

SAM
(beat)
You still like the yolks cut out

Marshall nods sadly Sam walks out of the bathroom

INT KITCHEN - MORNING

Sam hurries through the kitchen A feast is being prepared
The room is overrun with caterers and cooks Stews are
stirred vegetables are cleaned fowl is plucked A Chef cuts
the head off of a small quail

Sam negotiates his way through the bustle and taps a cook
on the shoulder

SAM
Excuse me Which one of you is the
chef--

But something stops Sam He looks directly past the chef
towards the

THE BACKYARD

Workers are everywhere A massive tent is being erected
Tables and chairs are being set up Gardeners are working in
the rose garden An altar stands in the distance covered in
vines and flowers

The reality of the wedding hits Sam for the first time We
see a renewed sense of purpose in his face
EXT GARDEN - MORNING

A cluster of weekenders sit amongst a string of picnic
tables drinking tea and eating waffles

Sam comes around the side of the house and sees Zoe
surrounded by women at the far table laughing about
something

He heads to another table nearby where Teddy and Ian are
seated There are jars filled with markers paints and

construction paper set on the tables for arts and crafts
Teddy and Ian both seem quite involved in their projects

SAM
Morning boys

IAN
(squinting)
Is it morning already Christit
sneaks up on you doesn’t it

TEDDY
Greetings Samuel You get enough
sleep

SAM

Perfect amount You
Teddy doesn’t bother to look up

TEDDY
Not sure we ever went to bed
really
(re art project)
I’ve been working on this for some
time now

CLOSE ON

Teddys piece of construction paper where a detailed
representation of a penis has been created from dried pasta
and Elmer’s glue

TEDDY (OS) (CONT’D)
It’s a cock

AT THE OTHER TABLE

Zoe is having her hair braided by Esme and one of the other
girls at the party

ESME
How exactly did you meet this Sam

ZOE
Just casually I was in New York
for some reason

(MORE )

ZOE (CONTD)
We sort ofbumped into each other
randomly We became fast friends
Pen pals really

ESME
Have you shagged this one yet

Zoe puts down her tea cup about to spit

ZOE
Of course not Jesus

Margaret sits at the table with some corn flakes She wears
thick sun glasses looking hungover and miserable

ZOE (CONTD)
What about you Margaret You seem
to know him best of all hmm

There’s a childish glare of jealousy in Zoe’s eyes

MARGARET
Nothing happened Personally I
think he might be a bit of a poof
really

Esme rolls her eyes

ESME
Come on out with it You two
shagged last night didn’t you

MARGARET
Unless you call a “shag” me patting
his back while the poor boy weeps
about some other slag who broke his
heart then yes we shagged all
night long

The girls all laugh A realization across Zoe’s face
ZOE
He’s a complicated boy Emotional

Very intense

ESME
You certainly stare at him enough

Zoe snaps out of it and looks to the girls

ZOE
What I do not

SAM (0S)
I made you something

The girls turn to find Sam standing and smiling a few feet
away He’s holding a hand-made macaroni and sea shell
necklace with little tiles that spell out “Zoe”

SAM (CONT’D)
It’s a wedding present I thought
the sand dollars matched your eyes
pretty well

ESME
Look Zo it’s got your name on it

Some more laughter from the girls Sam drapes the necklace
around Zoe’s neck He looks into Zoe’s eyes holding her
stare for a long beat

WHIT (0OS)
Hello everyone

Whit pulls up to the picnic tables in a yellow dune buggy
He’s wearing a nautical striped shirt pale blue swim trunks
and a yellow rain slicker over it all A couple of ASSISTANTS
are scribbling notes on a yellow pad Whit signs a couple of
things says a few final words the sends them off

WHIT (CONTD)
Family Friends Sam
(looks to Zoe)
Wife-to-be

Teddy stumbles up holding a Bloody Mary and waving his
drawing of the cock for all to see

TEDDY
Ahoy WhitI made you a wedding
present

WHIT

That’s sweet of you Teddy

TEDDY
It’s your portrait See

Laughter from the crowd Whit joins in Teddy walks off

WHIT
Well thank you Teddy Glad to see
your putting those art lessons I’ve
paid for to good use

Whit receives the necessary laughter taking a seat next to
Zoe

WHIT (CONT’D)
(to Zoe)
Where were you last night The
King’s chamber was cold

ZOE
Oh Couldnt sleep Still needed to
do some work on my vows

WHIT
(smiles)
Well that shouldn’t be too hard

Whit kisses Zoe passionately It lasts for a long moment He
runs his hand through her hair noticing her new necklace

WHIT (CONT’D)
What’s this hideous thing doing
around your neck

ZOE
Sam made it for me It’s a wedding
present
Whit turns to Sam
WHIT

A jeweler and a writer My God
youre certainly a jack of all
trades aren’t you

SAM
(smiles)
Yours is in the mail I just ran
out of sea weed

Some more chuckles but Zoe laughs the hardest Whit looks at
her then Sam A beat

WHIT
You know Sam why don’t you take a
ride with me down the beach Looks
like Teddy used up all our
fireworks last night and we need
some more for the reception What
do you say

Whit gives Sam an odd smile Zoe looks at Sam worried

INT BOY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Marshall stumbles around the room packing things up He
picks up Sam’s crumpled blazer off the floor giving it a
good dusting The Wizard of Oz postcard falls out and floats
to the ground

Marshall stares at it for a long beat
CLOSE ON THE POSTCARD

In neat cursive it says “Dear Sam Please dont come Im
getting married Love 2

Marshall looks down at it confused

CUT TO

MOMENTS LATER

Marshall is rifling through Sam’s suitcase searching around
for something He tosses Sam’s clothes and crumpled pieces of
notebook paper all around the room He finds something

Marshall takes out a small matchbox He opens it revealing a
modest quartz ring Marshall’s eyes go wide

EXT BEACH (MOVING) - DAY

Sam and Whit are side-by-side in the buggy Whit wears
goggles staring straight ahead with a serious look on his
face The wind is blowing hard and loud Sam looks terrified

The buggy drives further and further down the beach away
from the guests and sun bathers

WHIT
(shouting over the wind)
You boy’s having an alright time I
hope

SAM
(shouting back)
Great time Whit I can’t thank you
enough for all your hospitality

WHIT
You know Zoe left one of your
stories lying around the house and
I finally had a chance to read it
It was the one about the two
caterpillars who share an umbrella

Sam has a troubled look on his face

SAM
Really Why would you do that

WHIT
Well you’ve seen what I do I
thought I should know a little
something about what you do
(beat)
Youre not half-bad I thought it
had a lot of character

SAM
You’re not exactly my target
audience and to be honest that’s
one of my worst ones

Whit slows the buggy just a bit so the wind is not as loud

WHIT
Are you as much of a romantic in
your real life as you are in your
work

SAM
I can only try to be

WHIT

I’ve always beenmore concerned
with the human condition you know
I’ve always considered myself a
realist But you can tell that from
my body of work

(beat)
But I admire that quality in your
writing Sam Despite the fact I’m
not much of a reader

Sam stares at Whit confused He then looks behind them where
all signs of civilization are receding in the distance

WHIT (CONTD)
All Zoe does is read All day and
all night She’1ll read anything you
put in front of her She loves it
That’s why she likes you

(beat)

I’m working so much of the time
it’s difficult for me to cater to
all of Zoe’sinterests

Whit smiles at Sam He casually presses harder on the pedal

WHIT (CONTD)
But that’s Zoe isn’t it She
decides she wants to learn tennis
She starts going to matches takes
lessons every day develops a
backhand literally sleeps with her
racket And then just like
thatit’s over Decides tennis is
a dull sport Not for her Last
summer it was dragonflies She was
obsessed with the things Took
classes studied them painted
them couldn’t learn enough about
them Then one daypoof No more
dragonflies

A moment of silence Sam seems oddly moved

SAM
I never knew she liked dragonflies

Whit looks over at Sam

WHIT
She doesn’t Sam Not anymore

Suddenly Whit skids the buggy to a stop on a secluded beach
with jagged rocks all around them The only sounds are that
of seagulls circling them above

WHIT (CONT’D)

Zoe left me once
(beat)

Did you know that

An awkward silence This is clearly the first Sam has heard
of this

SAM
(hesitates)
NoI didn’t

WHIT
Of course you didn’t Nobody does
She’s very good at keeping secrets

Sam is genuinely confused

SAM
Who was the guy

WHIT
Some songwriter Played tambourine
or something

(MORE)

WHIT (CONTD)
(beat)

She left some note on the kitchen
table Told me she was in love
That she was running away with him
to Egypt And that there she had
left a ham waiting for me in the
oven

SAM
Wow What did you do

WHIT
I let her leave What would you
have done If you were me

SAM
Id probably go after her I guess

Whit stares out to sea

WHIT
I guess I just don’t feel the need
to chase girls around the
schoolyard anymore

A long moment of silence Sam raises an eyebrow

SAM
Well she came back didn’t she

WHIT
Of course she did She always does

Whit smiles leans back Sam’s eyes look a bit sad as Whit’s
statement sinks in

SAM
Should we go get those fireworks

WHIT
Oh don’t worry about it I’ll send
someone else
(beat)
Tell me Sam Do you like sailing

EXT FRONT YARD - DAY

Marshall showered and fully dressed puts the last of their
luggage in the trunk of the station wagon He slams the hatch

shut

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Marshall approaches one of the COOKS a small graying man
slaving over a hot stove

MARSHALL
Excuse me have you seen the other
guy I came here with He was
supposed to leave some eggs for me

COOK
Sorry Breakfast is over

The Cook walks away Marshall looks around for Sam
MARSHALLS POV THE WINDOW

Weekend guests lay around on blankets playing acoustic
guitars drinking on the beach

BACK TO SCENE

As Marshall turns to head outside he bumps directly into the
Blonde Maid who drops a large bowl of fruit onto the floor

MARSHALL
Oh my God I’m so sorry

She immediately gets down on her knees and begins picking
everything up Marshall gets down on his knees to join her

MARSHALL (CONTD)
It’s my fault Please Let me help

They pick up the fruit together without saying a word

Marshall glances in her direction Her eyes are red like
she’s been crying She looks up at him noticing him staring
He wants to say something but all that comes out is

MARSHALL (CONTD)
What’s wrong with you

The Blonde Maid looks at him oddly then stands with the
fruit

EXT BEACH - DAY

Marshall walks down the beach looking very much alone
People talk in individual little groups scattered amongst the
shore Nobody notices Marshall as he scans the crowd
searching for Sam

In the distance Marshall sees Zoe flanked by wedding
planners pointing at flower arrangements set up in front of
her Zoe notices Marshall out of the corner of her eye She
smiles and waves Marshall waves back slightly annoyed

All of the sudden Marshall screams loudly collapsing onto
the sand amidst the tall beach grass

Zoe turns hearing Marshall’s scream She excuses herself from
the wedding planner and rushes over towards Marshall No one
else seems to notice

EXT BEACH - MINUTES LATER

Marshall sits on a beach chair his leg extended as Zoe
kneels in front of him using a flowered handkerchief to halt
the bleeding from Marshall’s foot

ZOE
Are you feeling light-headed You
passed out for a few moments

MARSHALL
No I think I’m okay Just seeing
my own blood brought back some bad
memories
(beat)
How does it look

ZOE
Not terrible I’m just embarrassed
What kind of a responsible person
leaves a martini glass in the sand
(beat)
I guess we’ve never officially met
by the way I’m Zoeofficially

She extends her hand noticing that it’s covered in blood

ZOE (CONTD)
This is all a bit morbid isn’t it

MARSHALL
It’s okay It’s all mine anyway

Zoe wipes her bloody hand off on her expensive dress then
extends her hand again They shake

MARSHALL (CONT’D)
Has Sam told you a lot about me

Zoe pauses for a moment

ZOE
He certainly has It’s nice to
finally put a face to the name

MARSHALL
(genuinely surprised)
Honestly

Zoe nods enthusiastically clearly lying

ZOE
Yes of course
(beat)
You probably think we’re all a bit
whacked hmm Drunks and
adulterers the whole lot of us

MARSHALL
It’s okay I don’t really think I
had much of a chance with your
friend anyway

Zoes head is somewhere else

ZOE
Youre very brave for accompanying
Sam this weekend I shudder to
think what he’s told you about me

MARSHALL
Were basically brothers soSam
tells me everything

ZOE
Fuck man I hope not

Marshall thinks for a moment connecting the dots

Zoe seems

Zoe sighs

MARSHALL
You know come to think of it he
never told me how you two met
actually

taken aback

ZOE
So he hasn’t told you everything

MARSHALL
Mostly everything I’m just a
little hazy on that first part

and begins to wrap the handkerchief around

Marshall’s foot
ZOE
WellI was with Whit in New York
while he was doing some press for
one of his filmsor maybe we were
visiting his family Anyway we’d
just had some massive fight and I
left the hotel completely
hysterical and it was pouring rain
Are you sure you’ve never heard
this before Knowing Sam he’s
probably recounted it a million
times over

Marshall nods his head Zoe looks down for a moment

ZOE (CONT’D)
Anyway Id left in such a state
that I had forgotten my umbrella
and I was waiting to cross the
street looking miserable like a
massive wet dog and a few feet
away from me was Sam He was trying
to use a copy of the Times as an
umbrella It wasn’t working though
obviously

Zoe smiles

ZOE (CONTD)
We must’ve been the only two people
in the whole city who didn’t have
umbrellas that day I could feel
him staring at me you know and we
held stares for a moment

Zoe trails off Marshall tries his best to conceal his
confusion

ZOE (CONTD)
I’m sure you can fill in the rest
We ended up spending the whole day
together feeling bad for
ourselves His book had just been
rejected by some publisher Sort of
a mutual acceptance of pity I
suppose We saw an old film at some
shit cinema and laughed We spent
the night at some ghastly hotel by
his place because he wouldn’t let
me see his apartment I went back
to England the next day

MARSHALL
And then what

ZOE
He started sending me letters and
his stories and I made the mistake
of writing him back And here we
are

(smiles)

Jesus I’m sorry I can’t shut up
There’s no way you want to hear
about this

Marshall looks stunned Marshall opens his mouth to speak but
barely anything comes out

MARSHALL
Oh noI do

ZOE

It feels good to talk about this
with someone that’s not my
therapist These are all Whits
friends mostly

(beat)
I suppose if I wasn’t constantly
surrounded by these people there’d
be nothing to stop me from hopping
on a boat and sailing away with
your little friend

Zoe’s eyes turn red People around them have begun to gather
their belongings and head over towards a dock in the
distance

ZOE (CONTD)
I adore himI reallyI do
(beat)
But I’m not a fucking mermaid you
know I’m too selfish

Marshall awkwardly puts his hand on Zoe’s attempting to
comfort her He sees how deeply affected she is

MARSHALL
You mean shellfish

Zoe looks at Marshall A beat She bursts out laughing
Marshall smiles sadly

ZOE
I’m sorry you were dragged into
this I sent Sam a postcard begging
him not to come He claims to not
have received it but I think we
both know him a little better than
that

MARSHALL
Yeahwe sure do

ZOE
He certainly has a flair for the
dramatic I can’t wait to see what
the ring looks like
Zoe laughs to herself Marshall looks confused

MARSHALL
Ohyou knew about that

Zoe stares at Marshall oddly

ZOE
Knew about what
MARSHALL
The ring
Zoes smile fades
ZOE

What ring
Marshall realizes he’s said too much

MARSHALL
Nothing Nevermind--

ZOE
What ring Marshall

MARSHALL
(fumbling)
Nothing A friendship ring Sam got
it for me I thought you knew--

Marshall is bright red He’s a terrible liar

ZOE
Oh God Sam
(covers her face)
So stupid

MARSHALL
Please don’t tell him I told you

ZOE
What

Just then they both see Whits buggy speeding towards them
Zoe wipes her eyes quickly as the buggy screeches to a halt
in front of Zoe and Marshall Whit climbs out oblivious

WHIT
Why is everyone so down over here
Weve got a race to win don’t we

Whit puts his arm around Zoe Zoe looks at Sam

WHIT (CONTD)
Are we ready to go

ZOE
All ready over here

WHIT
Well that’s good Just want to
make sure you’re still on my team
that’s all

Sam walks over to Marshall a bit dazed

MARSHALL
We all set to leave

SAM
Actually hold that thought We’ve
got one more thing to do and then
were getting the fuck out of here

MARSHALL
What are you talking about I
already packed up the car

WHIT (0OS)
Is Marshall ready

Marshall looks genuinely confused

MARSHALL
Head over where Where are we
heading What is he talking about
We had a deal

Whit puts his hands on Marshall’s shoulder

WHIT
Our annual boat race We take it
very seriously Sam told me he
thought you two could put up a good
fight I didn’t know you sailed in
college Marshall

Whit saunters off Marshall turns to Sam

SAM
Look I bet Whit 700 we would beat
him in this race If we walk we
lose the money
(off Marshall’s reaction)
They’re tiny sail boats How hard
could it be

Marshall stares at Sam in disbelief Sam hops onto the back
of the buggy offering Marshall a hand

SAM (CONTD)
Don’t look at me like that

WHIT (0S)
Come on We’re going to be late

Marshall ignores Sam’s hand slowly mounting the buggy
himself It speeds off towards the other end of the shore
Sam looks over at Marshall noticing the bandages

SAM
What happened to your foot

MARSHALL
I stepped on a martini glass

SAM
(beat)
Why would you do that

Marshall’s eyes are angry

EXT BAY — DAY

A group of petite sailboats each with different colored
sails make their way at a brisk pace around some orange
buoys The water is calm and clouds are beginning to settle
along the horizon

A gathering of people camped along the shore casually
cheering and clapping A boat with a YELLOW SAIL has taken a
lead

ON THE BOAT WITH THE YELLOW SAIL

Whit spins the wheel like a true sea captain Whit’s brother
works the sails Whits father sits on a chair in nautical
stripes They all wear orange life jackets

Whit has a huge smile on his face

WHIT
Tag the line

Whit’s brother runs to the sail and carries out his task

Behind them a small fleet of sail boats clip along except
for the boat with the PINK SAIL which is emerging out of the
group

ON THE BOAT WITH THE PINK SAIL

Sam spins the wheel feverishly clearly out of his element
His eyes are locked on Whits boat ahead

SAM
Tag the line Marshall Did you
hear what he just said up there

Marshall is tangled in a complex system of ropes with no idea
what to do He looks at Sam with spiteful eyes

Sam runs over to Marshall and grabs the ropes off him
offering some help

SAM (CONT’D)
If you want to win your money back
I’m going to need your help out
here so let’s work together

Sam runs back over to the wheel They are gaining a little
ground

SAM (CONTD)
Push forward

The wheel suddenly spins out of control Sam grabs hold of
it steering with all his might

Marshall pushes the sails forward but it’s clear his heart is
just not in it

SAM (CONT’D)
Marshall Where’s your head at
right now

Marshall stares at Sam He lets go A beat

MARSHALL
Youre a liar

SAM
Let’s try to stay focused here

MARSHALL
Youre in love with her You’re
obsessed with her and that’s why
were here You lied about the
postcard and you lied about wanting
to be a good friend

(beat)

And that hurts me

SAM
Things have changed since this
morning Whit just told me Zoe left
him okay She left him once and
she’s going to do it again He’s
practically running scared All we
have to do is win this race and
prove to him that we’re men and
then we can all go home together
All three of us

MARSHALL

This isn’t real for her You’re
just a vacation

(beat)
You came here to break up some sad
lady’s marriage and you took
advantage of me because no one else
would ever be a part of this And
because I have a car

Marshall folds his arms Sam’s eyes are wild and desperate
UP AHEAD Whits boat is nearing the finish line

SAM
Now is not the time for therapy
Marshall You’re the one that went
through my bag

MARSHALL
Just admit it that you used me
That you’re currently using me

SAM
If you’re not going to help me win
then you’re dead weight

ON THE SHORE

Zoe is watching the race through binoculars

ZOE’S POV THE BOAT WITH THE PINK SAIL

Sam and Marshall are now physically fighting Sam has
Marshall in a headlock

BACK TO SCENE

SAM
You’re making us lose

MARSHALL
I have glass in my foot because of
you

The weight of the boat shifts drastically to one side As the
mast swings Sam ducks to avoid a collision but Marshall
doesn’t see it in time The mast knocks him off the boat and
into the water

Marshall surfaces floundering about and spitting water out
of his mouth He waves to Sam

Sam throws Marshall an orange life preserver

SAM
I’11l send someone back for you We
can beat this rich faggot

MARSHALL
(screaming)
Turn the boat around Sam I have a
fear of deep water

But Sam’s boat keeps going leaving Marshall floating there
alone Marshall takes off his red tie waving it in the air

EXT SHORE - LATE AFTERNOON

Several fire pits have been dug out of the cold sand The
weekend guests are keeping warm around them

Whit is surrounded by friends celebrating his victory He
wears a first place sash with a paper crown on his head and
holds a large succulent roast on a silver platter offering
slices of meat to his guests In his other arm Zoe rests
snug in his grip

Sam sits on a log by a fire on the outskirts of the crowd
Marshall sits back turned on the farthest end of the log
attempting to get warm by the fire yet still shaking
uncontrollably Sam can’t stop staring at Whit and Zoe

SAM
Look at him parading his meat
around like aI don’t even know
I mean isn’t he embarrassed To be
that oblivious

Marshall glares at Sam He lifts the bandage off his foot
revealing his open bloody cut Sam doesn’t seem to notice

SAM (CONT’D)
By the way I’m a little short on
the money I bet Whit If you could
front it to me I’ll pay you back
as soon as we get to the city

Whit works his way closer to the boys doling out slices of
glistening ham as if it were gold People help themselves
bestowing their congratulations upon the victor Marshall
eyes the meat

MARSHALL
I want some of that meat

Whit nears them Sam finally notices Marshall’s demeanor

SAM
What Whose meat His meat
(beat)
You’re not touching that meat

MARSHALL
I need that meat I haven’t eaten
anything since we’ve been here

SAM
What about your eggs this morning

MARSHALL
You forgot to fucking order them

Sam’s eyes grow panicked

SAM
Look if you touch that man’s meat
you might as well be waving a white
flag in the air Do you understand
that

WHIT (0OS)
Care for some cured victory ham
boys

They look up to find Whit standing before them his meat
extended Zoe stands by his side with cold eyes refusing to
look at Sam

SAM
None for me Whit Thanks You
know factory farming

Sam stares at Marshall awaiting his response A long beat

MARSHALL
No I’m alright Still pretty full
from breakfast

Marshall looks at Sam but Sam is focused on making eye
contact with Zoe to no avail

WHIT
(chewing)
I salute your courage out there
boys You gave it your best shot
(beat)
There’s no shame in losing

Sam is about to speak when another guest intercepts Whit and
begins a conversation Soon enough he and Zoe are surrounded
by another gathering Sam turns to Marshall

SAM
Youre a good friend

Marshall looks at Sam for a moment then gets up and walks
away

Sam gets up and rushes over to Zoe who stays behind while
Whit enjoys some conversation Sam takes her arm Zoe turns
to him annoyed and cold

SAM (CONT’D)
Are you mad at me or something

ZOE
(hushed)
You lied to me
SAM
What is this Now you’re turning on
me
ZOE

You lied to me You got the
postcard and you came anyway And
you dragged poor Marshall along
with you
Zoe clearly wants to say more but stops herself

SAM
Of course I got the postcard You
knew that And I came anyway Which
makes me romantic

ZOE
Which makes you a selfish
delusional little boy You’d go to
all this trouble just to ruin my

life

SAM
Ruin your life I came here to save
you

Zoe looks at Sam for a long moment then walks away

EXT BEACH - CONTINUOUS

The sun is beginning set as Marshall walks towards the house
past the rickety wooden dock at the far end of the beach

Ian and a couple girls are splashing around in the water
completely naked except for snorkeling gear laughing and

acting fucked up Ian sees Marshall

IAN
Hey it’s the boot Hello boot
Join us We’re all swimming naked

Laughter from the girls

MARSHALL
Actually I was just looking for
Teddy because I need my shoes back
Have you seen him anywhere

Ian looks confused
IAN
Yeahhe was just here a second

ago Right over there

Ian points out towards deeper waters Marshall squints
searching for Teddy but there is no sign of him

MARSHALL
I don’t see him

Ian swims out a bit blowing water from his snorkel into the

girls’ faces

Marshall stands alone surveying the water Still no one He
walks up the dock

Then he sees something Out in the bay a flailing hand
briefly emerges then disappears back under the water

Marshall remains still for a moment His face turns pale He
looks around There is no one else in sight save for Ian and
the girls

He opens his mouth to yell something but nothing comes out
Then suddenly Marshall starts sprinting at full speed down
the long dock and dives into the water

He begins paddling his arms and legs furiously breathing
intensely and spitting salt water He’s swimming as fast as
he can but Teddy is nowhere to be found Marshall slows his
swim down listening intently

Then he sees him Teddys hair bobbing up and down like
blonde seaweed a few feet away

CUT TO

Marshall lifts Teddys unconscious head out of the water and
tries to put him on his back but he’s too heavy He manages
to elevate Teddy’s head just enough for him to breathe

He begins swimming with all his might dragging Teddy along
with him The shore seems miles away Marshall screams

ON THE SHORE

A group of weekend guests turn hearing Marshall’s cries
They begin talking amongst themselves worried Zoe emerges
from the house looking concerned

Suddenly she realizes what is happening She begins running
towards the water as fast as she can

ZOE
Call a medic

IN THE WATER

Marshall is nearing the sand practically hyperventilating
He reaches the shallow water but he can barely stand Zoe
rushes into the water to help carry Teddy They drag him onto
the sand and lay him down

MARSHALL
(shaking)
He’s not breathingso much

Marshall collapses Zoe kneels above her brother frantically

ZOE
Oh god don’t do thiscome on
Teddyplease

There is no response Someone starts giving him mouth-to-
mouth

Sam runs over from the other end of the beach confused He
sees Zoe and Marshall and rushes over to help

Zoe is pressing on Teddys chest People are starting to
gather around them

ZOE (CONTD)
(whispering)
--come on Teddycome on
Marshall is watching from the outside looking delirious

then with a final push on Teddys chest he COUGHS

The entire crowd breathes a huge sigh of relief Zoe squeezes
Teddy in her arms kissing his forehead

ZOE (CONT’D)
Fucking hell you scared the shit
out of me

Teddy sputters and coughs regaining consciousness He looks
around for a moment trying to process everything

TEDDY
Did I go under

PARTY GUEST 7 (0S)
He’s alright He gave us a scare
but he’s fine

PARTY GUEST 8 (0S)
Somebody get this man a drink

Zoe and a couple others help Teddy to his feet and lead him
back towards the house leaving Marshall by himself

Sam runs over to Marshall out of breath

SAM
What happened

Sam extends his hand to Marshall Marshall stands up by
himself and swats it away storming off towards the house

EXT FRONT YARD - MINUTES LATER

Sam and Marshall are in the middle of a heated argument Some
local paramedics pack up their things into an ambulance
nearby

SAM
No No You do not do this right
now This is my last chance with
this woman

MARSHALL
I’m going home

SAM
But we still have some time left

MARSHALL
These peoplethese are not good
people Sam They’re irresponsible
Theyre likebabies with money

SAM
Look I should have never left you
out there but I really thought we
had a shot at winning You would
have done the same if it were me

MARSHALL
You never had a shot Sam I can’t
stay and watch you do this to
yourself anymore You can come with
me or not But I’m not going to be
a supporting character in your
story anymore

SAM
Don’t try and use metaphors with
me okay I’m the writer here and
I’m willing to forgive you for
telling Zoe about the postcard if
you could just support me

Marshall seems completely stunned by Sam’s demeanor

MARSHALL
You want to know what the sickest
part of all this is You preyed
upon a broken man

SAM
What Who

MARSHALL
You forced me out of the house with
your fucked up plan which shows a
complete lack of consideration for
all the shit I’ve been through
lately

SAM
Please Marshall give it a rest I
think everyone is a little tired of
hearing about your perceived
misfortune I mean the way you
decide to divulge this information
to anyone who is willing to listen
is disgusting

MARSHALL
What’s that supposed to mean

SAM
It means someone pistol-whipped you
in the head Marshall I’m sorry
that it happened and it’s a shame
but it happens to someone new every
day We move on with our lives Do
you know how many people are
starving in Africa

MARSHALL
I was assaulted Sam A man came at
me from behind and took my money

SAM
Come on if it wasn’t the pistol
whipping it would be something
else Who does that money belong to
anyway This is just like the time
you checked into the hospital when
you thought you had avian flu and
it turned out to be a sinus thing

MARSHALL
I was under a lot of stress

SAM
From what Talking too much

A moment of silence Marshall has nothing to say

SAM (CONTD)
It’s always something Always
coming up with new reasons not to
get a job or move out Honestly
it’s pathetic

(MORE )

SAM (CONT’D)
I did you a favor Marshall Your
parents will thank me I got you on
an adventure And now we’re this
close to getting what we wanted and
youre willing to give it all away

Marshall stares at Sam almost in tears

MARSHALL
Do you really think these people
care about guys like us You’re not
a real possibility You have
nothing to offer her You’re just a
mistress You’re a little vacation
for her And this What the fuck is
this

Marshall reaches into his pocket and takes the matchbox he
found in Sam’s bag out and holds it in the air Sam’s eyes
look wild

SAM
Give that back Marshall

Marshall throws the matchbox at Sam

MARSHALL
You’re young and you’re poor And
honestly You’re a shitty a writer

Sam charges Marshall in a fit of rage He tries to tackle
Marshall They grapple for a moment but Marshall easily
breaks free and accidentally elbows Sam in the face Sam
falls to ground blood coming from his left nostril Marshall
looks down at Sam disappointed

MARSHALL (CONTD)
I used to look up to you

Marshall turns and walks off towards his car

Before he gets in he takes one last look at the house The
Blonde Maid is standing by the side entrance holding some
dirty laundry They hold eachother’s gazes for a moment then
Marshall gets in the car

Sam lies still watching the Mercedes drive away He stares
over at matchbox laying in the tall grass

LATER

Sam is still lying on the ground holding his nose Whit
leans over him staring down INTO FRAME

WHIT
(concerned)
What happened to your face Sam

SAM
I fell down the stairs

WHIT
You should have the paramedics take
a look at it if they’re still here
Your nose is crooked

SAM
I know It was like that before

WHIT
Hmm Okay Well anyway the men are
off to the woods It’s a family
tradition before a wedding We’re
all going to sleep under the stars
tonight

Sam looks to the side and sees several men in camping attire
along with the camera crew from earlier They all carry
overnight packs

SAM
What’s the camera crew doing there

WHIT
Oh They’re cutting together a
little something for the guests as
a party favor Make sure to leave
your address with someone
(beat)
See you at the wedding Sam

Sam smiles softly

SAM
Yeah you bet

Sam watches Whit and his group of men march into the woods
WHIT
Keep an eye on the women while
we’re away

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Teddy lies on the green sofa recovering sipping hot tea
surrounded by Ian and other familiar faces

The movie screen is pulled down and an old black and white
movie plays in the background

INT BALLROOM - NIGHT

Zoe and some girls wear their nightgowns playing a game of
charades by the fireplace

Esme acts out a part for the girls getting some laughs Zoe
watches with a cigarette dangling out of her mouth Her head
is someplace else

EXT BACKYARD - NIGHT

The wedding preparations are finally complete Everything is
perfectly in place

INT BOY’S ROOM - LATER

Sam lies in bed on his back examining the Wizard of Oz
postcard for a long moment Finally he rolls out of bed

INT HALLWAY - LATER
Sam is outside Zoe’s closed bedroom door in mid-speech

SAM

I’m pretty sure he doesn’t even
think you’re that funny which to
be honest is one of your best
qualities He admitted to me out
loud that he hates reading I know
You think I’m young and irrational
and I am but at least I appreciate
you for all your best qualities I
know I’ve made a lot of terrible
mistakes and probably alienated a
majority of the people that are
close to me but I did that because
of you and that’s love isn’t it

(beat)
If you could just give me a chance
At least where we could live
together in the same place for a
month and I could make some money
and buy you things and we could
develop hobbies together I could
see myself spending the rest of my
life with you I could be the
father of your children

Sam takes out the matchbox from earlier and opens it
revealing the ring

SAM (CONT’D)
I bought this for you because I had
this whole plan and I thought
things would were going to be a
certain way and now they’re not--

ZOE (0OS)
Sam who are you talking to

Sam turns and sees Zoe standing at the far end of the hall
holding a glass of water

ZOE (CONTD)
You look like shit

SAM
Well I got punched in the face
(beat)
How much of that did you hear

ZOE
Not enough
(beat)
Want to give me the abridged
version

Sam looks at Zoe sitting up on one knee and extending the
open matchbox towards her Zoe stares at the pathetic ring

ZOE (CONT’D)
(sighs )
Let’s go for a walk

EXT WOODS - DAWN

The sun is just beginning to peek out from behind the clouds
The sky is pale orange Zoe leads Sam along a dirt path into
the forest

ZOE
You think Marshall will be back for
the wedding I never had a chance
to thank him properly for saving
Teddy

SAM
I don’t think we’ll be seeing each
other for a while I don’t even
know how I’m supposed to get home

Zoe picks up a pink and yellow wild flower and begins picking
off petals one by one

ZOE
What did you and Whit talk about
earlier

SAM

He told me you used to like
dragonflies I never knew that

ZOE
You get anything else out of him

Sam hesitates He wants to say something but he doesn’t

SAM
Nope That’s about all we covered

They keep walking quietly taking in the scenery Zoe gets to
the last petal on the flower and rips it off Sam notices

SAM (CONTD)
Howd we do

ZOE

Not well

(beat)
I never saw myself as a woman in
this position Sam Really

(beat)
Oh Sam You’1ll love other women
Shorter women--

SAM
I like your height It’s my only
chance of being a father to an
athlete

Zoe laughs sadly Sam stops walking

SAM (CONTD)
Don’t marry him Zoe
(pause)
I mean it

ZOE
Oh Sam I do have a certain amount
of awe for your persistence

Sam walks up to her and stops He grabs her arms

SAM
Look at me You don’t want to marry
him okay You can’t We used to
laugh at this guy

ZOE
Sam I have to You don’t
understand
(beat)
I want to

SAM
You don’t want to Zoe Otherwise
you would’ve done it already

Zoes face is pained with emotion Sam remains very matter-of-
fact Their faces are close together

ZOE
I told you from the beginning I was
trouble Sam Just go home

SAM
I love you

ZOE
No you don’t

Sam kisses her hard A long passionate life-affirming kiss
Zoe pulls away looking at him for a moment

ZOE (CONTD)
Is this how your little story ends

Sam kisses her again pushing her up against a tree She
grabs his hair pulling it as they stumble to the ground

They hang on to each other rolling around in the leaves
They move quickly Sam puts his hands up Zoe’s dress

She unbuttons his corduroys He kisses Zoe’s neck Her ears
His eyes are closed Zoe’s are open He climbs on top of Zoe
her dress hiked up She digs her hand into the soil

CUT TO

A FEW MINUTES LATER

They lie together quiet and still Zoe puts Sam’s arm around
her waist then turns the other way She seems oddly
disconnected Sam lays his head on her shoulder very at
ease

SAM
It’s times like these I wish I
smoked cigarettes more
consistently

Zoe sits up She begins to button her dress Sam notices

SAM (CONTD)
What are you doing

ZOE
I’m late

SAM
Late for what

ZOE
(matter-of-fact)
My wedding Sam

Zoe gets up and heads barefoot through the woods Sam gets
up and follows after her Her face is more hardened then
weve ever seen it

SAM
What do you mean You’re not
actually going back there are you

ZOE
Sam Please Let it be

SAM
Youre still getting married After
what just happened

ZOE
Nothing happened Sam You got what
you came for A clumsy passionate
fuck in the woods
(beat)
I haven’t even written my vows yet

Zoe begins walking faster Sam catches up quickly

SAM
There’s a reason for that Zoe

ZOE
I’m begging you Don’t make this
harder then it already is

SAM
Why are you marrying him Give me
one good reason and I swear I’11
leave right now

ZOE
It’s not that easy

SAM
Well it should be

Zoe starts walking towards the house Sam stands there for a
moment then chases after her

SAM (CONTD)
Youre settling Zoe You’re
settling for a life of wealth and
mediocrity

Zoe ignores him

ZOE
Go home Sam

SAM
I’m going to ruin your wedding in
front of everyone

ZOE
Oh And how do you plan on doing
that

SAM

I’1l tell Whit about us I’11 tell
him everything

ZOE
(exasperated)
Whit knows Sam

Silence Sam looks confused

SAM
What

Zoe softens her voice She looks sad

ZOE
He knows He’s always known

SAM
I don’t understand How would he
know

ZOE
Because he’s not an idiot He’s
always known

A moment of silence Sam’s face turns angry A sad
realization coming to the surface

SAM
So is that all I am to you
Justdragonflies

ZOE
What is that supposed to mean

SAM
I know all about your tambourine
player Whit told me

ZOE
You have no idea what you’re
talking about Sam I loved him at
the time

They’re entering into the BACKYARD of the house Several
banquet tables have already been set The staff bustles back
and forth carrying trays drinks tablecloths

SAM
You love everyone Zoe That’s the
problem here You love everyone
without consequence And Whit let’s
you get away with it You really
want to be with someone who’s just
going to let you walk away

ZOE
How did you see this ending Sam
What are you proposing Did you
think I’d just waltz up to the
altar and announce that the
wedding’s been canceled because I’m
in love with a twenty-three year
old

Sam doesn’t have an answer

ZOE (CONT’D)
Quick Sam Tell me about this
amazing plan hmm What’s our move
Do I go pack up my suitcase jump
in your friend’s station wagon and
run away with you to your one-
bedroom apartment

(MORE )

ZOE (CONT’D)

I’m sure youll be able to provide
for me and the little ones with all
the money you’ve made from your
wildly successful children’s
stories

(beat)
Or better yet why don’t we hop on
a whale together and live under the
sea

Sam is at a loss for words

ZOE (CONT’D)
I can see you’ve really thought
this through

Silence for a long moment Sam runs his hand through his
hair looking down He looks like he’s about to cry

SAM
I think we could maybe make the
“whale plan” work

He smiles sadly

ZOE
Darling you’re a child

Zoe walks up and kisses Sam on the forehead brushing leaves
out of his hair

ZOE (CONT’D)
We were fucked the moment we forgot
our umbrellas

Zoe turns and walks towards the house For the first time
Sam doesn’t follow

CUT TO

EXT NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY (FLASHBACK)

It’s pouring rain A group of people are standing under
umbrellas at a busy street corner waiting for the light to
change

Sam a year or so younger standing there without an
umbrella He tries his best to protect himself with a
severely damaged news paper

He turns and notices a woman in an olive green raincoat
standing a few feet away at the front of the curb It’s Zoe

She looks like she could be crying but her face is so wet
it’s hard to tell She doesn’t have an umbrella either

She turns around feeling Sam’s eyes on her He smiles at
her She looks down After a beat he walks over to Zoe and
holds the news paper over her head shielding her from the
rain

INT BOY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Sam sits at the windowsill looking down at the staff
preparing for the party Several older guests sip cocktails
wearing formal attire still barefoot

Whit his band of brothers and the film crew parade in from
the woods They look dirty but refreshed Whit notices Sam
watching from above points and smiles A camera man angles up
and shoots him

EXT CAFE - DAY (FLASHBACK)
Sam and Zoe sit at a corner table in a quaint-but-crowded New
York cafe They are both still sopping wet talking over tea

Zoe pours some brandy from a flask into her porcelain cup

She slips off her engagement ring putting it in her pocket

INT MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Zoe is in her wedding dress surrounded by a large group of
over-excited women They mess with her hair adjust her
dress touch up her make-up Zoe seems distant She looks
beautiful and Esme sprinkles flower petals in her hair

The folded up pieces of blank notebook paper intended for
Zoes vows rest on a wicker chair in the foreground

EXT PARK - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Rain has drenched the meadows of Central Park turning the
place into a swamp Sam and Zoe walk alongside a fence She’s

self-consciously pouring her heart out to him

Sam puts his arm around her She looks at it questioningly
but leaves it where it is

INT MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

The ladies rush Zoe out of the master bedroom making their
way down the hall heading for the stairs at a brisk pace A
look of realization across Zoe’s face

ZOE
Shit I forgot my--

Esme pops out from the line of frantic women stuffing the
folded up pieces of paper into an envelope She hands it to
Zoe

ESME
Right here love

ZOE
No You don’t understand I never
finished them

ESME
You’11 think of something Come on

Esme ushers Zoe down the stairs

INT OLD MOVIE THEATRE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

We are behind Sam and Zoe as they sit and watch a 35mm print
of The Wizard of Oz in a near empty movie theatre

Sam scribbles a note on a ticket stub and passes it to Zoe
It takes her a moment to read Zoe rests her head on Sam’s
shoulder

EXT BACKYARD - DAY

The wedding ceremony is underway

An elderly Minister with salt-and-pepper hair walks down the
aisle holding a bible and wearing a flower on his lapel

Whit walks down the aisle with his mother at his arm He’s in
a custom tuxedo looking handsome

The bridesmaids follow in their beautiful lavender dresses
accompanied by Whits groomsmen Everyone looks happy

and as they reach the podium every head turns towards the
back of the aisle in anticipation

Zoe stands there holding Whits father’s arm in a spring
dress cut just above the knee Her feet still bare and dirty

She walks slowly taking her place beside Whit at the altar
Teddy is in the front row wearing dark glasses and smoking

MINISTER
We are gathered here today

Zoe stands facing the minister She can feel Sam’s eyes on
her She turns her head slightly looking in Sam’s direction

But he’s not there

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - LATER

Sam walks down the endless winding road lugging his suitcase
behind him with some difficulty He’s sweating profusely and
it seems like miles to the nearest highway

Suddenly Sam stops noticing a car in the distance heading
right towards him As it nears we see it’s Marshall in his
beat up Mercedes

Sam watches as the car drives right past him

EXT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Marshall pulls up onto the front lawn and hops out of the
car rushing into the house looking around frantically

THROUGH THE KITCHEN WINDOW

We see the Blonde Maid standing alone Suddenly Marshall
rushes INTO FRAME grabbing her attention He talks
animatedly for a few moments

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - CONTINUOUS

Sam is still standing on the side of the road Marshall’s car
is heading towards him from the other direction He drives
past Sam again

Then after a few moments the car screeches to a halt It
slowly reverses pulling up right beside Sam

Marshall stares straight ahead for a long beat saying
nothing Then the trunk pops open Sam puts his things in the
back and hops in the front seat

INT STATION WAGON - CONTINUOUS
Sam looks at Marshall curiously Marshall avoids his gaze

SAM
What just happened back there

MARSHALL
I asked that sad maid for her phone
number

Sam stares at Marshall in disbelief impressed

SAM
Wow Did she give it to you

Marshall exhales

MARSHALL
No

A quiet pause

SAM
I’m sorry for not calling you back
for a year I don’t think I’ve been
completely honest with myself
lately

An even longer moment of painful silence Finally
MARSHALL
Youve been a really bad friend to
me Sam

Sam nods thoughtfully

SAM
I deserve that

MARSHALL
Youve said some nasty things these
past few days Things that I’m not
even sure you can take back
Sam shakes his head

SAM
I know You’re right

Marshall finally looks at Sam

MARSHALL
Youve taken a lot of my money too

SAM
Marshall I know I know that
(genuinely)
And I’m sorry
(beat)
I think I’d like to start seeing
your therapist maybe
Marshall nods

MARSHALL
How’d things end with your girl

Sam stares out the window He half-smiles to himself
SAM
I ruined her wedding
EXT BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS
Zoe and Whit remain facing each other at the altar
MINISTER (0S)
Have you prepared your own vows
Zoe
Zoe looks back up at the Minister looking unsure
ZOE
(nervously)
Uh I haveyes
Whit looks at Zoe lovingly touching her face

Zoe looks down for a long moment fumbling with the folded up
pieces of blank notebook paper then opens them up slowly

Inside is the Wizard of Oz postcard She turns it over

EXT COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

The pale blue Mercedes speeds along down the empty highway

Zoe and Sam ride in silence on opposite sides of the lift
Some other hotel guests stand between them
