THE CROW 3 RESURRECTION

Written by
Steven E de Souza

Revised draft
April 19 1997

FADE IN
CAMERA flies over the twisted maze of a DARK PORT CITY

WOMANS VOICE
Theres a legend that when a body
dies a crow comes to escort its
soul to the next world

NEW ANGLE - FLYING CROW

WOMANS VOICE

(continuing)
If death has come through violence
or treachery and if the soul is
pure sometimes the crow can
return the soul to its body so
that Justice can be done even
from beyond the grave

The crow begins to descend

WOMANS VOICE

(continuing)
But the legend never answers one
question What happens when the
soul dies but the body doesnt

The crow lands on a PIER-SIDE PILING CAMERA WIDENS
EXT SAN FRANCISCO BAY - A PIER - DAY

A CARGO SHIP glides into a berth horn BLASTING a warning
CAMERA FEATURES two hard looking SAILORS who move to the
rail look down at -

THE PIER - A CAR

Where four MEN - TERRELL ACER BRUNO and MORGAN stand
expectant Theyre all too well dressed for this seedy
locale and its almost Third World clientele They
exchange a look with the sailors Terrell points to his
watch As they move toward where the gangway will be
lowered they pass a man whose cheap flashy clothing is
equally out of place in the thick of the hard working
pier crowd This is the aptly-named FINDER and in fact
he has just found Terrell and Co

Finder NODS across the dock to a scruffy looking homeless
COUPLE (a MAN and a WOMAN) carrying ratty fishing gear
They nod back

As Terrell and Co proceed down the pier they almost
collide with the homeless couple Their BUCKET spills
fish and scummy water all over Terrells shoes

HOMELESS MAN
S-sorry sir - didnt see you-

Terrells eyes flash fury We sense he is controlling his
temper when all he does is roughly smash the homeless
couple aside and lead the others toward the ship

THE HOMELESS COUPLE

share a smile As Finder passes by them the man slips him
a wad of bills then hits a hidden button speaks into a
tiny microphone

MAN (KATO)

This is Kato We made them Its
Terrell all right Acer and two
others are with him

AT A ROACH COACH - INTERCUT AS NEEDED

The man behind the counter GOMEZ speaks into his throat
mike Next to him sits another undercover cop ROSSI

GOMEZ
Can you maintain eye contact

KATO
Yes but it isnt necessary You
can smell them a mile away

A TOURIST IN A HAWAIIAN SHIRT - ALSO INTERCUT

at a dime-a-peek binocular stand hes watching this from
the end of the pier But he aint no tourist hes CAPTAIN
WYKOFF and hes their boss

WYKOFF
Very funny Kato but last I
checked you werent with the K-9
unit We just got a tip from
Interpol that Terrells moving out
of street drugs and into designer
stuff Working for Lucien Raynor

HOMELESS WOMAN (SARAH)
Lucien Raynor The number-one bio-
hack in the world That guy can
make molecules tap dance in a test
tube
KATO
Yeah The sixty people who died
in Holland from Raynors acid
arent dancing

ROSSI

(looking up)
Theyre going up on board Cmon
Gomez Time to ship up and shape
out

GOMEZ
Thats shape up and ship out

ROSSI
Stuff it Gomez The closest you
ever got to the navy was your
rubber ducky

The cops inside the Roach Coach check their pistols and
hidden mikes jump out begin to glide across the dock
Thats when

A LOAD OF CRATED GEESE

falls off a vehicle and SMASHES onto the ground The birds
begin squawking and honking all over the dock to the
frustration of the longshoremen and the amusement of the
crowd

WIDER

As people and vehicles scramble to avoid or capture the
birds the pier jams up The cops try and cut through the
suddenly chaotic scene

KATO AND SARAH

KATO

(into mike)
Come on you guys come on
theyre aboard-

ROSSI
Were coming were coming
somebodys dinner is in the way
Kato and Sarah look up at -

THE STEAMER

Terrell and the others are at the top of the gangway
Theyve been met by the two sailors and theyre about
to go inside the ship

BACK TO SCENE
KATO
Were gonna lose them Were
going aboard

Kato and Sarah run forward

WYKOFF
WYKOFF
(yells into his mike)
Damn it you two wait for backup
SARAH
We lose them inside that ship
well never see the hand-off
KATO

as he and Sarah run along the dock they see that theyll
never reach the distant gangway in time to catch up Then
Kato notices a CARGO NET full of supplies just now rising
from the pier He tugs Sarahs sleeve

KATO
Come on Express elevator

SARAH
Oh no - Youre a lunatic

But she follows him They both jump catch the webbing and
soar upwards

ON THE DOCK

Wykoff has run forward and caught up with the rest of his
team who have finally cut through the crowd

WYKOFF
Kato Im warning you - watch that
kung fu shit I want these perps
in one piece so they can testify

KATO AND SARAH - ON THE NET
Kato grins at Sarah speaks into his mike

KATO

(into his mike)
Aw gee Captain I was hoping to
try out my new move the Kung
Pow Brain drain

WYKOFFS VOICE
The Kung Pow Brain drain

KATO
Yeah Thats where you reach into
a guys eyeballs and pull out his
brain

WYKOFFS VOICE
Are you bullshitting me
(worried)
Youre bullshitting me arent you
SARAH
(to Kato)
Why do you always jerk him off

KATO
What else do you do with a dick

He looks down

TERRELL AND COMPANY

as they disappear into a hold
BACK TO SCENE

He and Sarah jump hit the deck rolling Head toward
the hold

ON THE PIER

Gomez and Rossi run up the gangway Wykoff stays on the
dock to cover their rear

IN THE HOLD

Dark echo-y with slivers of light coming through poorly
maintained vents Theres a constant CLANK as CRATES grind
their way up into daylight on a rolling bar conveyor belt
coming from below Terrell and his companions are being
handed several hermetically sealed BOXES by the two sailors
Suddenly Kato slides into view entering via a deck vent

KATO
San Francisco Police Freeze

WIDER
The men instantly turn FIRE
BACK TO SCENE

Their bullets rip up decking where Kato had been standing
He has literally moved in the blink of an eye

THE CONFUSED GUNMEN
blink where did he go A SHADOW clues them in too late

Whoosh Kato comes sailing in from above somersaulting
in mid-air to deliver HEAD KICKS to the two sailors as he
lands Theyre smashed aside unconscious before they hit
the deck

TERRELL AND HIS PARTNERS

AIM at Kato - hes a goner - then - BLAM BLAM Morgan is
CUT DOWN The others turn

AT THE DOOR

Sarah has fired the shot As Terrell and Acer return
SHOTS she ducks out of harms way

BACK TO SCENE

Kato grabs a crate from the conveyor belt holds it chest
high CHARGES the men firing at Sarah BULLETS splinter
the wood shred the crate - but it holds until hes on top
of them and he slams them with it Acer and Bruno fall but
Terrell breaks free grabbing two of the hermetic boxes
and running up a ladder

Kato starts to follow but a KICK from Bruno knocks him
off balance Bruno - twice as big as Kato - grabs the
next crate SMASHES it down

ON DECK - OUTSIDE THE HOLD

Sarah suddenly finds herself outflanked by Terrell and
Acer She has to retreat and they make a break for it

IN THE HOLD

Brunos big hands sweep aside wood and splinters But
Kato isnt under the box Bruno turns too late Kato
flies in at head height kicks Bruno into a wall Both
men land recover And then - with three quick blows
Kato kills Bruno the whole thing over in a ballet of
death as brief as a heartbeat Before Brunos body has
hit the floor Kato has crashed out the door into daylight

ON DECK

Rossi and Gomez come running aft from the gangway right
into Terrell and Acers view Theres a flurry of SHOTS
that send the crew panicking Terrell hits Gomez who falls

Sarah coming up from the rear is the first at Gomezs side

GOMEZ
Im okay go go

They start after the criminals Gomez trailing But Sarah
heads backwards face worried - until she sees

KATO

intact running forward Even fifty yards away his eyes
show the question Where are they
SARAH

relieved that Katos alright she signals Who the fuck
knows She points to where they were last seen forward
Suddenly a SOUND makes her whirl gun ready

NEW ANGLE

Its a WINCH spinning so quickly its smoking CAMERA
RAKES as Sarah looks around - SEES a big metal CONTAINER
dropping rapidly toward the dock She ducks aside as it
just misses both her and the ships railing

ON THE DOCK

People run screaming as the SHADOW gives them a moments
warning WHAM The container CRASHES onto the pier

ANOTHER ANGLE

with a ROAR a new CAR stickers still in place crashes
out of the container and roars down the pier Acer driving
Terrell beside him

SARAH

SARAH
Shit

Rossi and Gomez come alongside of her They all realize
that by the time they make their way forward to the
gangway the car will be long gone But they try anyway

SARAH
(continuing turning)
Kato Come on

They run for the gangway CAMERA ADJUSTS to tilt down and
show Wykoff futilely FIRING at the rapidly distancing
vehicle

KATO

Still further back he starts forward - then suddenly
stops The fleeing car is about to pass beneath him

He looks around Just below the rail here is one of the
ships thick mooring cables Kato takes a deep breath
and runs down the cable

THE OTHER COPS

see this move Theyre all amazed except for Sarah
who just grins

SARAH
Thats my partner
KATO - LONG SHOT
He makes it to the bottom before he loses his balance
At the last minute he dives for the dock landing on a

startled longshoremens pallet

Ignoring the cursing man Kato jumps to the top of the
fork-lift for a better view

HIS POV
The smugglers car is about to leave the pier
BACK TO SCENE
KATO
(showing badge)
Police emergency I need your

vehicle

And he tosses the guy out Jumping into the seat he guns
the fork-lift and chugs forward

THE DOCK

The fork-lift crashes through boxes crates and fruit
Hearing the horn people jump out of the way

WIDER

Hes not going to catch the car Even now it is going
through the gate

BACK TO SCENE

Kato hits the fork-lift control raising the forks to the
highest level He drives straight for the fence Just
before it hits he leaps from his seat up to the forks
When the fork-lift CRASHES into the fence Kato is jet
propelled over the top of it

OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE

Kato flies through the air like one of the X-men lands on

THE ROOF OF THE CAR

TERRELL
What was that

ACER
What was wha-

He doesnt finish what because Kato has leaned down
opened the door and tossed him out
Terrell starts to draw his pistol but Kato swings into
the car feet first Terrell falls onto the car floor
momentarily stunned Kato grabs the wheel Looks up
HIS POV

Hes about to crash through the guardrail above the
coast road

BACK TO SCENE
He hits the brakes Nothing happens He looks down
FLOORBOARD - HIS POV

Terrells body is covering the pedals His foot is on
his hand

BACK TO SCENE

Kato tries to keep one hand on the wheel while he uses
the other to haul the guy out of the way It aint easy

WIDER

At the last possible second Kato hits the brakes The
car burns rubber almost skids over the cliff

UP ANGLE
The front wheels go over the edge
AT THE CAR

Kato catches his breath gets out of the car starts to
relax and thats when an arm goes around his neck

NEW ANGLE

Its Terrell conscious again and rather pissed As he
tries to choke Kato Kato grabs his forearm flips him
over his head and onto the car roof

UP ANGLE - FROM BELOW

The car teeters and groans from the impact begins to
tilt over the cliff

SIDE ANGLE

to drag Kato onto the car roof

HIGH ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN

The tilting vehicle and Terrells unrelenting grip combine

The car teeters even more Terrell has to release Kato to
keep himself from falling Gasping for breath Kato also
hangs on Each man tries to improve his position but even
the slightest move sets the car rocking again Still Kato
inches his way closer to the rear seat slowly reaches for
the box below

INSIDE THE CAR

Kato leans over gets his hand close to the box - and
thats when something INSIDE the box squirms and HISSES

UP ABOVE

Startled Kato recoils - and gets a kick in the face from
Terrell who has slid down the car roof As Kato goes off
the roof he slides toward the edge -his weight tips the car-

TERRELL

DIVES FOR THE GROUND As the car ROLLS OVER with a groan
of metal the box slides along the car seat Terrell
snatches it and runs up to a startled driver who has
paused on the shoulder to watch this scene Terrell flings
the guy away jumps in his car and roars down the ramp

RESUME KATO

The car is still teetering downward Kato scrambles like
a spider over the hood and windshield but as he labors
up the car undercarriage groans and buckles Just when
we think hes going to make it the car goes over all the
way Kato falls just behind it

LOW ANGLE - SHOOTING UP

At the last second Kato grabs a handhold on a branch and
hangs five stories up

TERRELL - IN THE ESCAPING CAR

Comes roaring out of the last switchback below the cliff
nearly causing an accident with an oncoming car He looks
up - SLAMS the brakes on

WIDER

The car from above EXPLODES in front of him Terrell leans
out of the window looks up

KATO - SLO-MO

About to lose his grip and then with his remaining
strength he kicks his legs up like a gymnast gets one
ankle over the edge of the cliff As he does the violent

gesture makes something flip out of his pocket Its

A HOTEL KEY
we follow it as it falls and falls and falls -
-right into TERRELLS OUTSTRETCHED HAND
Terrell

has just enough time to look at it when he hears SIRENS
He looks ahead down the road SEES POLICE CARS racing
toward him

-
He hits the gas and escapes
UP ABOVE

Katos been running and fighting for twenty minutes Hes
battered bruised and on the verge of falling Hes one
hand hold away from safety - he lunges for a grip - and
MISSES

CLOSER

At the last second a HAND grabs his wrist - Sarahs hand
We WIDEN as she leans back to haul him up Wykoff appears
a second later and helps

Uniformed COPS appear behind them fan out and search the
area

SARAH
You all right

KATO
Yeah

(turning to Wykoff)
Whats the damage to the Unit

WYKOFF
The Units fine thanks to you
Gomez is wounded but its just
a scratch

SARAH
How the hell did this happen

KATO
Somebody talked thats how it
happened

SARAH
Somebody with a badge is picking
up drug money

KATO
It wasnt drugs That box they
delivered- It was alive

SARAH
Alive

WYKOFF
Well sort this out with our
Federal Friends Im gonna tear
them a new asshole

KATO
Youll have to wait in line

SARAH
Uh partner I think itll have
to wait Remember

She steps closer lowers her already husky voice

SARAH
(continuing)

Little soiree were both attending
(on his look)

Do wedding bells ring a bell

Kato laughs puts his arm around her

KATO
I gotta stop working the night
shift

IN AN ALLEY - ON THAT MYSTERIOUS BOX--DAY

swaying as Terrell walks with it TILT UP Terrell calms
himself as he walks slowly controls his breathing He
wipes blood from the corner of his mouth goes to a
prearranged spot SOUND from nearby He has his pistol
out before he realizes that its ACER Both he and his
clothes are beat up from their earlier collision with
the asphalt

ACER

VOICE
My property gentlemen Now

CAMERA RAKES as Terrell turns hands the box to the MAN
in the back seat the man Wykoff called Lucien Raynor

But forget the name Wykoff used this man has too many

passports for it to matter Well call him BYRON

He looks like your basic mad scientist - eccentric
clothes Tim Burton hairdo out of style glasses He
strokes the box coos to it

BYRON

going to take good care of daddy

fucking hereafter

PRING

(to the box)
There there youll be just fine

(in the same tone)

undone Im not happy Terrell
What will make it all better

TERRELL
Getting even
As Byron smiles he holds up the KEY he caught earlier
Its a HOTEL KEY

EXT BAY AREA HOTEL - DAY

Where Annes family reacts uncomfortably to all these

high jinks

RESUME SCENE

Kato pulls Anne close

KATO
-and Sarah -

(pause)
Most people only get one partner
in life Im lucky to have two

Suddenly with a ROAR a HELICOPTER

rises into view from behind the hill Everyone turns
The BACKWASH from the chopper disturbs their formal

clothing
KATO
Puzzled he PEERS into the craft -
IN THE CHOPPER - HIS POV

Beside the PILOT is Byron And behind him using the
seatback for a snipers rest is Terrell He is already
AIMING an ASSAULT RIFLE

BACK TO SCENE
Instinct takes over Kato turns shouts

KATO
GET DOWN --

SEQUENCE - SLO-MO

And no were not doing the cliche ballet of death here
because were not in slo-mo for the bullets that we know
are going to come but to observe the PEOPLE in the
instant before the shots ring out

KATO has from instinct addressed his warning to his
partner

SARAH who turns herself to signal the other officers
and then her eyes lock for a second on Katos before
she is drawing her pistol and knocking the nearest
GUESTS to the ground -

KATO turns looks at

ANNE who is standing like most looking at the noisy
intruder hanging in mid-air while

WYKOFF

is diving diving down to hug the earth behind the BAR
set up on the knoll -

ALL THE COPS

take down all the civilians they can gather in their
arms and then the ROAR and WIND of the helicopters
BLADES merge with the SOUND of KATOs heart as he RUNS
toward the lens and seems to by his own will break
out of slo-mo and into

REAL TIME - RESUME

The bullets from the aircraft rip into the ritual below
Bones and glass shatter equally White tableclothes
drench in the red of blood and wine Gomez a step ahead
of the bullets throws himself on a child Rossi charges
the lens FIRING Hes cut down like wheat
IN THE HELICOPTER

Terrell pans the gun barrel professional clinical

focused on the skill of weapon work Byron looks out

the window a lopsided grin on his face enjoying the
result

KATO

continues running forward pausing as he sees a bawling
CHILD crawl out from under Gomez body then racing
bullets literally as they dog his heels come perilously
along side and then pass him

KATO
Aaanne---

The bullets reach Anne a second after the CAMERA does
Kato is there in time to catch her before she hits the
ground

DOWN ANGLE

Shes as loose as a baby BLOOD wells with her pulse on
the breast of her wedding gown

ANNE
(with odd grace)
Kato I knew youd come
She jerks spasmodically
ANNE
(continuing quickly)
Our father who
Shes dead
Katos so stunned she slips from his hands to the ground
her gold chain running through his hands until the cross

is gone to join her

KATO
Nooooooooo

He screams to the heavens and as he does he sees his own
devil

THE HELICOPTER
is still there
KATO

whirls runs toward the helicopter Hes so crazed he
seems to think he can climb the sky And son of a bitch
if he doesnt He runs through the ruined party leaps
onto a table then to another then vaults to the bar
runs across the top LEAPS to the top of the outdoor
heater and before that teeters under his weight he has
grabbed the shaft of a flagpole and swung into a tree

IN THE HELICOPTER
Theyre all stunned

TERRELL
Jesus Christ--

THEIR POV

As Kato swings from tree to tree CRASHING into the
copters door He yanks the hot gun barrel pulls
Terrell forward so hard his head CRACKS the glass

WIDER

The sudden addition of weight makes the craft tilt
Kato drops down to the skids catches hold just in
time Immediately starts back up

IN THE HELICOPTER

Terrell is still dazed Terrified Byron sees Kato
creeping toward him He looks around sees Terrells
pistol in his waistband

Kato gets one foot on the skid

Byron draws the pistol points it Nothing happens
And suddenly the two men are in a competition of death
as Byron tries to figure out hammer slide and safety
while Kato climbs ever higher to kill him

Kato reaches for him Byron squeals in terror closes
his eyes and with all his fear SQUEEZES the trigger with
both hands

It goes off BLOOD splatters whats left of the cockpit
window

WIDE

Katos body tumbles downward from the hovering aircraft
He crashes through fifteen feet of evergreens and crumbles
at the trunk The helicopter leaps into the sky fleeing
Sarah is the first one to reach the body Wykoff a few
steps behind her In the background Annes mother SINGS
to her childs body Sarah takes Katos bleeding head into
her lap and SCREAMS

SMASH CUT

support Hes rushed to the roof elevator

THE SCENE - DIFFERENT ANGLE

PULL BACK and we SEE that were looking at the helipad
from a WINDOW elsewhere in the hospital Three PATIENTS
are watching JULIUS a soft featured wistful type who
could be any age from 20 to 40 OSWALD mid-40s
fidgety and FETTERMAN in his 60s with a no-nonsense
military bearing

FETTERMAN
Sloppy landing sloppy landing
I landed MacArthur much better

war were screwed

INT OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

TILT UP from Kato almost unrecognizable due to bandages
and tubing His head has just been shaved and is painted
with Betadyne The surgeon in charge is DR BATISH Shes

her age

DR BATISH
Patient is a 29 year old Asian
male a police officer in
exceptional physical condition
We have a close range firearm
entry wound above the right
occipital put with an entry
track through the frontal lobe
ending on the border of the
parietal

INTERN
Lets hope its on the border

dare take the bullet out

DR BATISH
(dryly)
Thank you Roger I appreciate

CUT TO

DR BATISH
(continuing)

Okay lets do it

She hits the trigger twice making a chain-saw like ROAR
that echoes around the room

NEW ANGLE

Batish saws through the top of Katos skull BLOOD mists
the air

The top of the skull is placed in a dish

UP ANGLE - THE DOCTORS

They gather around the open cranium Look inside Batish

depressed)
But Im afraid hes going to live

DISSOLVE TO
INT HOSPITAL - SUN ROOM - DAY

We PAN the area A RADIO is playing - a NEWS PROGRAM
that lets us know its now today And sitting ina
wheelchair in the path of one lonely sunbeam is Kato

His appearance is startling The bullet and the operation
have scarred him bizarrely but theres a perverse
savage beauty to the damage his face might almost be
considered arresting or mysterious like the Phantom of
the Operas

if only the expression werent so so blank

Kato doesnt move doesnt blink Some drool gathers in
the corner of his mouth Drips down onto his hospital
pajamas Nobody notices Nobody cares

WALDO an orderly comes over pushes the wheelchair

WALDO
Come on Kato Time for Group
Yeah I can tell youre excited
Howd you like that Raiders game
No shit I lost a bundle too

CUT TO
INT HOSPITAL - GROUP ROOM - DAY

Batish comes in hospital INTERNS trailing her Her
hairstyle and glasses have changed but not her energy
level or efficientcy She sits down in a circle of chairs

BATISH
Hello Welcome to the Processing
Group For those of you here for
the first time Id like to review
what we do here

This group provides social and
psychological therapy for people
who due to trauma or disease have
lost their ability to process
certain mental information This
rarely affects intelligence but
manifests itself in other ways
Sometimes with delusions or
paranoia sometimes in an
inability to grasp the passage
of time And sometimes in an
inability to retain information
and memory

(to the group)
Would someone like to start

JULIUS
I would Dr Batish I just want
to say how happy I am to be
joining the group Ive heard a
lot about it and I just know its
going to help me with my memory
problems

Long pause Everyone looks at him not very impressed
by his sincerity

BATISH

(gently)
Uh Julius Youve been in the
group for three years

JULIUS
I have

BATISH
Yes Look in your pocket

CLOSER

He reaches into his breast pocket is startled to find
something there A photograph

JULIUS
Where did this come from

BATISH
We took it last Christmas To
help you remember all our names

He looks at it It shows a Christmas party in this same
room Julius is posing under the tree with some of the
other patients

The NAMES of everyone have been posted under their
faces - a memory aid that obviously aint working

JULIUS
I dont remember it Are you sure

OSWALD
Dont trust her Its a fake
just like the moon landing
ANOTHER PATIENT
(jumping up to
Oswald)
The moon landing was not fake
I know because I was there

JULIUS

(startled)
Wait a minute somebody landed on
the moon

BATISH
Please lets not get sidetracked-

FETTERMAN
How can you all sit here shooting
the shit when the whole country is
facing a crisis President Eisenhower
is in critical condition

BATISH
Uh Fetterman Eisenhower is dead

FETTERMAN
Oh Jesus Christ then Nixons
President

Batish tries to force a smile and carry on But she

glances up and SEES

SARAH - THROUGH GLASS PARTITION

coming down the corridor She waves at Batish familiarly

BACK TO SCENE

IN THE CORRIDOR

BATISH
Excuse me Ill be back in a
minute

She looks through the glass at the group By now Oswald
is looking for hidden microphones under the seats

But Sarah is only looking at Kato

BATISH
No Not today

SARAH
And tomorrow

BATISH
Have I ever lied to you

SARAH
Not in two years And I still
keep coming back Next week

Batish squeezes her hand

BATISH

CUT TO
JULIUS - CLOSE

He has just discovered the photograph in his pocket
again As he puzzles over it we WIDEN to SEE the group
breaking up

BATISH

(in mid-speech)
-- thank you all for joining us
Its been stimulating as always
Until next time

She gets up leaves She pauses beside Kato touches his
wrist Then she walks over to Waldo speaks quietly He
nods

ANGLE ON WALDO

He comes over starts to wheel Kato down the hall We HOLD
on them as they leave and then CAMERA discovers CLARENCE

SHERMAN PhD His eyes narrow boring in on Kato Clarence
looks around spots Batish We STAY with him as he catches
up to her

CLARENCE

(waving a file)
Dr Batish Id like to talk to
you about that patient of yours
John Kato Why is he in your
Processing Group Thats for high
functioning mental patients of
normal intelligence Kato is a
complete catatonic

Batish breaks her quick stride turns to face Clarence

BATISH
Look Clarence we both know your
doctorate is in Hotel Management
so dont start diagnosing my patients
And for your information Kato is
not catatonic

She walks away Indignant he catches up again

CLARENCE
Not catatonic

He opens the file reads as they walk

CLARENCE

(continuing)
Severe damage to the parietal
lobe complete destruction of the
perceptive fibers As a result
patient cannot feel pain heat
cold or any physical sensations
If thats not catatonic Ima
moron

BATISH
Youre a moron Yes that is an
accurate description of the
physical damage to his brain But
everything else - memory speech
locomotion - those things are all
intact Thats why hes in the
group So he can start making human
connections again

Shes reached her goal the vending machines She opens
her purse

CLARENCE
Well doctor if hes capable of
walking talking and thinking
then why is he doing an imitation
of a Caesar Salad at the taxpayers
expense

Batish stops trapped She turns sighs

BATISH

(finally)

I dont know Ive tried every-
hing The only possibility is

hat at the time of physical injury

ct

ct
there was tremendous psychological
trauma as well Katos wife was
murdered right in his arms It may
be that the undamaged portion of
his mind just shut down to protect
itself from that memory

She takes out change goes to the candy machine

CLARENCE
Then how do you cure that

BATISH
You keep him in physical therapy
so his muscles dont atrophy and
you wait and hope that the world
will somehow push the button
Damn

Shes said this because the machine has eaten her quarter

CLARENCE
The button

She wiggles the knob then the little change door

BATISH
Yeah The button It might be a
piece of music the smell of a
familiar kitchen the voice of

a friend or the face of an enemy

Anything that punches hard enough
on the pain that locked up his
brain Struck the second time
sometimes the motor of the mind
starts up again

CLARENCE
(scornful)
Thats your theory

BATISH
Yes

She KICKS the vending machine Gets her candy bar
BATISH

(continuing exiting)
Sometimes it works

EXT HOSPITAL - DAY

Sarah comes out A CAR cruises slowly alongside her
A big good looking young galoot named TONY is driving
Hes not as good looking as he thinks he is

CUT TO
TONY
Hey doll Want to take a
moustache ride

SARAH

(weary)
Dont you have to start shaving
first

We TIGHTEN as she gets in The accouterments in the car
-and the CRACKLE of a police radio - make us realize its
an unmarked police car

SARAH
(continuing)
We on a call

TONY
Nah our luck Back to the
division for paperwork Hows
your friend

SARAH

TONY
Bullshit Guys at the station

SARAH
I dont want your opinion any more
than your come-ons okay

(unconvincingly)
Theres always hope Like Scarlet
said Tomorrows another day

(pause depressed)
Fiddle-de-fucking-dee

They drive away CAMERA PANS across the street Two
MEN -CUSTIS and STOKES - are in a parked car Custis
PHOTOGRAPHS the cops with a digital camera

INT BIODYNE PHARMACEUTICALS - DAY

WIDEN from a flush-mounted desk MONITOR The DIGITAL

PHOTOS we saw taken earlier are being DOWNLOADED Custis
and Stokes are seated here giving their report to a MAN
who sits back to the CAMERA looking at the city below

CUSTIS
She came today same as every week

CAMERA CIRCLES the room as Custis speaks Some other

CUT TO
MEN stand around the desk

We realize with a start that we recognize some of these
people Pring Acer And - Terrell But all have changed
Not like the slight changes of hairstyles and wardrobe on
Sarah and Batish here the changes are deliberate
Exaggerated

Its as if these people wanted to change as much as
possible but only on the outside

TERRELL
And the doctors Does she talk to
them About medicine Research
(with meaning)
Pharmaceuticals

CUSTIS
No And we checked

STOKES
Yeah I went in last week did my
vending machine repairman schmoozed
with the nurses Pay attention to
the ugly ones they talk up a storm
This gash is definitely not working
on a case All she does is visit
this patient

As Stokes fumbles through some notes Custis comes to
his rescue tweaking the equipment

CUSTIS
John Kato Used to be her partner
Former SFPD Police Detective
retired two years ago full metal
disability pension No immediate
family Only visitor is the
surveillance suspect

The last figure the CAMERA finds is leaning back ina
luxurious chair in the shadows But now it leans forward
into the light Its Byron Clean shaven now hair
marcelled back body Armani-ized Only the driven eyes
are the same

He looks up at Terrell

BYRON
So shes not interested in me
I thought I made more of an
impression

TERRELL
How could you Conrad Byron
didnt exist until two years ago
He taps Sarahs image on the video screen

TERRELL

(continuing)
And she can stop existing whenever
you say

Pring and Acer look up expectantly sensing action But
Byron rocks in his chair pensive

BYRON

No Shes been chasing smoke for
two years looking for a man who
doesnt exist anymore Killing her
would bring an investigation We
dont need to attract attention
not with a high profile drug ready
to hit the market

STOKES
That everything

BYRON
Not quite Were going over our
pharmacy inventory and there seem
to be some discrepancies Ether
Dimethylamine Oxalychloide

STOKES

(casual)
why would I know anything about
that

TERRELL

Because theyre key ingredients
for making crack cocaine ina
street laboratory Like the one
you set up on

(checking a note)
South Vincent

He looks cooly at Stokes who has the sense to fold his hand

STOKES
Okay Okay You got me Mr Byron
I thought maybe I could do a little
thing of my own but-- youre right
dont even say it how could it be
my own taste when I didnt even pop
for the materials One thing you
gotta know is I never touched the
stuff myself I dont smoke drink
nothing You can have everything
back The chemicals that are left
the money I made

BYRON
We have enough of both thank you
And now thanks to you we have
exposure I dont like exposure
Stokes Were on the verge of a
big government contract We cant
risk our reputation for pennies

STOKES
Your reputation Youre pushing
drugs for the government Im

pushing them on the street whats
the fucking difference

BYRON
Thats a profound philosophical
question Stokes Perhaps youll
help us answer it in the years to

come
STOKES
(seizing the life
jacket)
Y-you mean youre gonna let me
go
BYRON

I mean were always short on donor
organs for our tissue banks
Especially young healthy donors
who never smoke or drink

Stokes jumps up too late Already Terrell has drawn
and aimed a silencer equipped 40 caliber THUP THUP

Stokes shot in mid-wanna-escape leap arcs almost
gracefully to the floor then slides across the polished
marble

INTERCOM VOICE
Mr Byron Dr Fields called She
wants to see you in the lab right

away

BYRON
Tell her Im on my way Janice
Oh and Janice have Quinn and

Baker come in here I want my
office swept again for bugs

He stands closes the computer file on Sarah It WINKS OUT

BYRON

(continuing)
Have Mr Stokes dismantled Mr
Terrell Try not to damage too much
of the merchandise We get good
prices for all the parts
RECEPTION AREA

JANICE nods to two big men QUINN and BAKER They nod
knowingly go into the office as Byron comes out

BYRON
(aside)
Make sure you sweep under the rug

CAMERA follows Byron as he crosses the Penthouse floor

He passes ranks of the impressive hi-tech medical

machines his company supplies As he is about to hit the
elevator button the elevator opens and DR ANNABELLE
FIELDS storms out a large piece of CARDBOARD under her
arm Around 40 looking a decade younger because she gets
up at six to pound a punching bag so she can deal with all
the assholes in her life Right now her chief asshole is
Byron

BYRON

(continuing)
Dr Fields I was just on my way
down to see y--

FIELDS
What the hell is going on

She flips over the cardboard A mock up of an advertisement
it shows happy vacant-eyed workers on some public
infrastructure project The multi-racial cast and the color
coordinated hard hats have the slick appeal of a soft drink
ad Only the name -CIVICALM - and the illustration of a
PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE in a corner inset tells us this is an
ad for a drug and not gum or cigarettes

FIELDS

(continuing)
How can you plan a campaign for a
drug I havent even finished beta
testing -

BYRON
Doctor theres nothing wrong with
contingency planning If we wait
until all our ducks are in a row
before we plan we -

She puts her hand firmly on his back steers him into
the elevator

FIELDS
- could end up with some very dead
ducks Hit twelve

Byron hesitates not used to being addressed in this
manner But he complies The doors SHUT
AN ELEVATOR - LAB FLOOR - DAY
The elevator opens Fields and Byron exit walk through
a room full of LABORATORY ANIMALS in cages Theres
everything from rats to rabbits to dogs and chimps They
approach a pneumatic door Fields hits the control and it
whooshes open
OTHER SIDE
They walk into NOISE and STATIC
REVERSE ANGLE
Fields ASSISTANTS are using a powerful MMR CATSCAN
FIELDS
Jesus Raoul dont use that with-

out the warning light -

Already Fields PENS are rattling in her pockets
Byrons TIE TACK jerks away from his chest and -

CLOSE
CLANGS onto the side of the MMR
WIDER

As the assistants shut down the machine The tie tack
falls to the floor The mortified assistant scramble to
get it

ASSISTANT
I - Im sorry Mr Byron -

BYRON
(even)
No harm done

FIELDS
(to the assistants)
Get lost Now

They quickly exit through the pneumatic door Fields moves
further along to a computer workspace

FIELDS

(continuing)
Sorry about that Ace Take a
chair

BYRON

I dont like the tone of your voice

CUT TO
Im the head of this company

FIELDS
Okay take two chairs

She hits buttons on her keyboard A VIDEO WINDOW appears
on the computer screen Footage of a WHITE RAT in a CAGE

FIELDS

(continuing)
You see this Civicalm Normal dose
for a healthy adult rat

She hits the button Another cage another rat Then
another

FIELDS

(continuing)
Normal dose for an adult
Normal dose for an adult

BYRON
Seems fine

FIELDS
Try this

She hits another key Now we see one mouse after another
Staggering Twitching dying

FIELDS

(continuing)
Normal dose for an adult Normal
dose for an adult Ditto yadda
and yadda

BYRON
Obviously the dosage was wrong

FIELDS
No it wasnt

She stands

FIELDS

(continuing)
Theres just a variation in the
weight of adult rats of 20 to 30
grams Not very much but just
enough to make the normal dose
for one rat a fatal dose for
another

BYRON
I dont see your concern Theres
no problem with Civicalm Just
with the subjects
Byron stands

uses his

FIELDS
No problem If you extrapolate a
20 gram variation to humans youre
talking about four pounds People
gain and lose four pounds in a week
And people weigh from 90 pounds to
250 pounds theres no way we can
standardize the dosage

BYRON
Relax Doctor Its under control
Toleration variation is routine in
this industry -

FIELDS
Yes but people aint gonna
tolerate this variation theyre
gonna drop fucking dead Thats
taking sedation a little too far

Board of Directors meeting voice

BYRON
Doctor Fields The United States
Government has contracted us to
develop a reliable low cost
sedative without the psychological
side effects of previous hypnotics
My research says we have done this

FIELDS
Your research might as well be
printed on toilet paper cause
thats all its good for

She hits the computer A graph comes up then a DNA

footprint

other information

FIELDS
(continuing)
Look at these variations All
over the map And this serum you
incubated Civicalm in where
the hell did it come from
(peering closer to
screen)
Where is this original animal
subject thriving after five years

BYRON
The subject is thriving

FIELDS
he subject aint human thats for
sure not with this serum footprint
This isnt simian either looks

canine except for these mutated
genes

BYRON

(sharply)
Im not here to play 20 questions
not on my salary Nor on yours

FIELDS
You expect me to meet the FDA
people on Thursday

BYRON
Thats what Im paying you for
And between now and then I expect
you to run all of these tests again
And again

FIELDS
All right But it wont change one
fucking thing about this fucking
drug

BYRON
Youre predicting the results of
the tests before you run them the
second time Hardly scientific
method

He moves to the door turns

BYRON

(continuing)
I expect more professionalism on
Thursday

FIELDS
Ill try not to say fucking in
front of the FDA

He looks at her sharply goes out
INT ANIMAL LAB - DAY

Terrell and Acer are waiting near some of the cages
Byron joins them

TERRELL

Shes going to crack isnt she
(on Byrons look)

Let me take care of her

BYRON
Not yet Billions are at stake with
this government deal I need Fields
to sign off on the research or well
lose the contract After that if
shes a loose cannon shes a loose
cannon that goes overboard

He gets in the elevator leaves Terrell finishes up his
cigarette notices the CHIMP in the nearby cage With a
grin he flicks the butt into the cage The chimp eagerly
picks it up then HOWLS in pain when he burns his fingers

TERRELL
Stupid fuck You never learn

A BEAUTIFUL SUNSET

CAMERA ADJUSTS Were in the sunroom Kato sits by the
window head lolling eyes vacant Collar wet from his
own drool

A JANITOR mops the area Moves a table lamp a potted
plant and then Kato

None of them seem to mind
NEW ANGLE

As the janitor moves away Batish appears drained after a
long day She notices Kato turns toward Waldo whos moving
a BODY down the corridor

BATISH
Waldo can you get Kato back to
the ward

WALDO
(indicating his
gurney)
Right away Doc gotta hit the
freezer first

He goes into the elevator CAMERA HOLDS on this corridor
The janitor has mopped his way down to a fire door It
OPENS behind him We HEAR his muffled voice

JANITOR
You aint supposed to use this
door Go around to -

Thats all he says before he is battered and kicked into
silence by three JUNKIES They move as quietly as they
can down the corridor The LEADER sneaks a glance around
the corner

HIS POV

CAMERA PANS the empty corridors then moves to - the
PHARMACY closed at this hour

BACK TO SCENE
LEADER
Fucking candy store man Take
what we need sell the leftovers

2ND JUNKIE
What leftovers

Laughter ending in a hacking cough Theyre all sliding
into withdrawal They cross quickly toward the pharmacy
As they move one of them draws up short

3RD JUNKIE
Fuck were busted

CAMERA adjusts Hes pointing to Kato They freeze
until the leader looks at Kato more carefully He grins

LEADER
Busted

He steps closer - flicks his CIGARETTE into Katos face
No reaction even as the butt falls to Katos breast
and burns out scorching his pajamas

LEADER

(continuing)
Hes a fucking carrot dipshit
Now open sesame

The 3rd junkie takes out lockpicks With shaky hands he
starts to work on the door

LEADER

(continuing)
Come on come on you said youre
a pro -

3RD JUNKIE

I - I got the shakes Eddie -

BATISHS VOICE
What are you doing

NEW ANGLE

Batish has returned Even as she asks the question she
realizes the answer She spins darts toward a phone
Its halfway to her ear before the Junkie Leader has
charged forward yanked its wire out and pressed her
against the wall

JUNKIE LEADER
You got a key mama

BATISH
Get out of here Now Before its
too late

JUNKIE LEADER
Its already too late bitch

He grabs her roughly drags her to the pharmacy door

JUNKIE LEADER
(continuing)
Open it

BATISH
I dont have the key

He slaps her

BATISH
(continuing)
I said I -

He slaps her again

BATISH
(continuing)
- dont have the key

He looks at her as pissed that she isnt afraid as he is
that she isnt cooperating Suddenly he grabs the shoulders
of her lab coat and pulls them down pinioning her arms

He quickly pats her down

LEADER
No key huh No key
(realizing its true)
No fucking key -

2ND JUNKIE
Jesus Eddie we gotta get
something-

LEADER
Yeah were gonna get something
right now

He looks at Batish with a different expression Runs his
hands over her body again

LEADER

(continuing)
Youre pretty fine for an old lady
you know that

And in an instant he knocks her to the floor He kneels
over her but even though her arms are pinned her legs
arent She kicks him hard

LEADER
(continuing)
Bitch Hold her

KATO

Still sitting still drooling while the SOUND of the
violation continues ten feet away

BACK TO SCENE

The men take turns kissing her sloppily giggling Then
it gets serious The leader starts to rip open Batishs
clothes She fights him furiously punching biting
kicking Its all the others can do to hold her down
KATO

No change unless a longer trickle of saliva counts
BACK TO SCENE

The Leader takes out a knife Slits Batishs bra open

HOSPITAL WINDOWSILL - SAME TIME

The crow lands here It peers intently into the room
CAMERA TIGHTENS on it

KATO

Is it our imagination or was there a flicker of a
reaction in his eyes

CROW - AT THE WINDOW

It CAWS flutters away

BACK TO SCENE - LOW ANGLE

The Leader UNZIPS HIS FLY spreads Batishs legs Suddenly
the 2ND JUNKIE looks up - as TWO WHITE CLAD LEGS appear in
the foreground The 3rd Junkie notices them first We

follow him upwards as he stands

3RD JUNKIE
Hey Its the carrot

NEW ANGLE

They all turn Kato is standing there on unsteady feet
face still a blank cipher Behind him the wheelchair
finishes a graceful TURN from the momentum of Katos
rising

LEADER
Get rid of him

The 3rd Junkie snaps out a switchblade Swings it Suddenly
Katos arm is up to block the blow The 3rd Junkie blinks

HIS POV

The knife is in Katos arm TILT UP Expressionless
showing no pain Kato looks at the knife How did that
get there We almost hear long dormant mental gears
turning Knife Perpetrator Victim

BACK TO SCENE

The 3rd Junkie starts to giggle

3RD JUNKIE
And we thought we was stoned

WHAM A FIST ends his sentence
ON THE FLOOR

The other two junkies REACT as their friend SLAMS down
beside them nose shattered eyes blank

TEETH and BLOOD leak from his torn mouth

BACK TO SCENE

The two remaining junkies leap to their feet The 2nd junkie
charges - we HEAR the CRACK as Kato breaks his ARM then

his KNEE Kato spins KICKS -

THE SECOND JUNKIE

SLAMS into a water cooler which erupts around him the
water turning RED -

THE REMAINING JUNKIE
PUNCHES Kato in the face brutally twice
There is absolutely no reaction Its like hitting a wall

The Junkie has the presence of mind to block Katos return
punch -and then he HOWLS as Kato REACHES DOWN -

NEW ANGLE
As Kato grabs the guy by his by his well by something
we remember is exposed and convenient And - and even

though we cant see it clearly the hysterical SCREAM from
the junkie gets the idea across as Kato whirls SPINNING
HIM AROUND UNTIL HIS FEET ARE OFF THE GROUND Then Kato
LETS HIM GO

THE LAST JUNKIE

gets his wish He gets into the Pharmacy Theres a
sickening CRASH as he goes halfway through the wired
glass and dangles there four feet above the ground

NEW ANGLE

He MOANS and passes out bleeding from a dozen cuts

BACK TO SCENE

The sounds of combat and now RINGING ALARMS bring security
guards and Waldo running

SECURITY GUARD
(RE the scene)
Holy shit -

WALDO
Dr Batish

He helps her to her feet She pulls her labcoat closed
Already she has the presence of mind to take Waldos ID

card from his lapel and use its clip to secure her own
modesty

WALDO
(continuing)
Are you okay

BATISH
Im fine Im fine - in fact

She moves over to Kato who now slumps to his knees drained
She peers into his face takes out her little flashlight to
look in his eyes As she hoped he reacts

BATISH

Kato looks around at his surroundings

KATO

A chilling thought races through his mind Clumsily he
starts to run his hand over the scar on his head

KATO
(continuing)

Batish gingerly puts his hand down

BATISH
All memories

KATO

(mind working)

He settles into the chair again confused

KATO
Yesterday

She points over to where workers are repairing the pharmacy
glass He looks there just cant connect

Batish sees hes searching his scattered memories for
something just under the surface

Suddenly she spins and throws a punch at him pulling
short at the last moment

Without even blinking he catches it She winces in pain
He releases her

BATISH
See Your reflexes remember even

when you dont

Kato extends his arms looks at his hands like theyre

strangers and then looks at Batish like she isnt one
He looks at Waldo who smiles looks back at Batish

(reading from notes)
-and destroying hospital facilities
to the tune of twenty six hundred
dollars And we still havent heard
from the plumbers

BATISH
We do have insurance -

CLARENCE
-which will not cover us if we
continue to keep a dangerous
psychopath in a facility thats
not designed for that purpose

BATISH
Hes not dangerous -

CLARENCE
Really What about those two dead
men not to mention the one in

the Urology ward singing soprano

BATISH
They were criminals Kato was -
is- a policeman He did what his
instincts told him to do

CLARENCE
My instincts say we should ship
him to State

BATISH
Your instincts also told you to
buy Beta instead of VHS for the
childrens center

Batish goes past him into the night

CLARENCE

(at the door annoyed)
Damn it Batish If he cant feel
pain heat emotion how human can
he be God knows whats going on
in that mind of his

CUT TO
INT CORRIDORS - KATOS POV - NIGHT

UP ANGLE of the ceiling going past Seen through Katos
damaged perception the ceiling is weirdly wildly out
of proportion and dimension Its like the Caligari
set but with shadows that

--squirm
REVERSE DOWN ANGLE - KATO

Being pushed along by SOMEONE WE CANNOT SEE Suddenly we
turn into a doorway Whoever is pushing the wheelchair
moves away

INT ISHMAEL ROOM - KATOS POV - NIGHT

Strange angles and lighting make the furniture seem twisted
and warped yet somehow still warm

Someone SITS DOWN behind the giant desk His face is hidden
but his voice - though strange and bizarre -resonates with
power

VOICE
Sorry to drag you out ona
night like this Mr Kato

KATO
W-who are you

VOICE
You may call me Ishmael Oh
dont worry about your vision
You were given a mild sedative
when we brought you here

KATO
Here Where am I

Kato looks around the room
ROOM - KATOS POV

Seen through his eyes all the angles are off all the
furnishings out of scale Nonetheless the warped perception
doesnt disguise the fact that the room is full of
Americana flags busts of Lincoln an eagle inkwell

Its twisted yet comforting CAMERA pans to the backlit
Ishmael

ISHMAEL
Thats not important Mr Kato
Ive been looking at your file
You were an outstanding police
officer
KATO

And t-thats why you dragged me
here in the middle of the night
ISHMAEL

Exactly Our organization - like
the one you served with - is a
special strike team But not one
with such a limited vision as anti
smuggling We take a broader view
but with a sharper edge We answer
directly to the Oval Office We
have no bureaucracy No congressional
hearings We have only our nerve
and a handful of trusted Agents
And wed like you to become one of
them

Even in his condition Kato can see the absurdity

KATO
You cant be serious

ISHMAEL
Were deadly serious One of our
field agents forwarded your file
to us

(indicating folder)
Youre the perfect Agent Offically
listed in all the public records as
a helpless invalid

KATO
I am helpless

ISHMAEL
According to this police report
on my desk three would be rapists
have a very different opinion
And your medical records indicate
that your physical reflexes are
completely intact

KATO
My mind isnt My

ISHMAEL

(agreeing)
Yes your language skills have
been severely impaired Not a
problem Were not hiring you
for chit chat Were hiring you
to be an instrument of justice

KATO
Im still a long shot Thats not
enough reason

ISHMAEL
Mr Kato people in our line of
work are willing to lay down their
lives for something I wont say
its America because these days
well son these days America is
in bad shape Some people say shes
finished Damaged goods

(pause)
They say the same about you So
why not a damaged American to save
a damaged Nation It has a certain
sense of poetry

Does Ishmaels hand reach out strike a control Its
hard to tell in the dim light but from somewhere
PATRIOTIC MUSIC begins to quietly PLAY

KATO - NORMAL PHOTOGRAPHY

Somehow its making sense to him

KATO
There theres things I want to
do have to do

FAVORING ISHMAELS SHADOWED FACE

ISHMAEL
Yes exactly You want to do what
you were trained to do You want
to fight for justice and right
and destroy evil and greed

KATO
My my partner

ISHMAEL
Yes I will be your partner
Together we will remove the tumor
of ennui from the body politic of
America

KATO
My partner is Sarah I have to
see her tell her

ISHMAEL
Yes tell her youve joined our
crusade Right now she and those
like her are alone out there
struggling against overwhelming
odds - waiting for their Champion
Americas salvation You Kato -
you
FAVORING KATO
He stands full of energy for the first time

KATO
Sarah

ISHMAEL
Go to her Kato Protect her-

protect us all

The Patriotic MUSIC BUILDS Kato whirls runs out
of the room

INT CORRIDOR - LOW ANGLE

Kato steps into a shaft of light and A HUGE SHADOW
falls across him

REVERSE ANGLE
Its the crow fluttering like an avatar at the window
BACK TO SCENE

The giant shadowy wings seem to flap from Katos own
back He rises with them - LEAPS towards the glass

EXT HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Kato CRASHES through the window lands on the street
runs off into the night

THE CROW - ECU
atop a streetlight it CAWS triumphantly

CUT TO
EXT NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Finder is here trying to get laid Like our other
characters he has changed a bit but hes still desperately
hip

FINDER

(to a pretty girl)
Yessir You got your uptown Yuppies

LAUGHTER from the group

FINDER
Okay girl you want to pass on me
because I was up front with you
Fine Theres better than you

corner

LONG SHOT - AROUND THE CORNER

Finder finishes his tirade turns - and then REACTS as
Kato jumps in from an impossibly high perch landing
at his feet

FINDER
Hold that thought

KATO
Finder Youre Finder

FINDER
Hey nobodys laid that old name

FINDER
Oh I see youre one of those
sidewalk lawyers But if kinda

KATO
He moves closer

He stops

turns

seeing the scars

Sarah I want Sarah She is

struggling against evil and greed
(continuing)

Trying to get out of the darkness

and into the light She needs me

FINDER
Uh right

(sudden thought)

FINDER
(continuing)
Shit Its you Kato Man they

FINDER

(continuing)
-uh fine Sarah shes your old

around Kato)

ook)
I mean you gotta have the
Bread Dinero Money

Yeah

scanner in
her call

moola

KATO
You want money

From the way Katos lips form the word we realize it is
lost in the misfiled sections of his mind But wait
KATO
(continuing brow
furrowed)
Money

And then like a curtain lifting - well a bit anyway -

we see that the concept of money returns to his
consciousness and with that the realization that he doesnt
have any

KATO
(continuing
dismayed)
Money

FINDER
Right How much you got

Kato looks pensive lost Then he looks OS and smiles
With a karate SCREAM he LEAPS Finder jumps backwards
but the attack isnt aimed at him

NEW ANGLE

Kato flies through the air as far as humanly possible -
one leg extending with savage fury - and then CONNECTING
with

AN ATM

He hits it The machine is DEMOLISHED Money EXPLODES
everywhere

BACK TO SCENE
Kato LANDS from his impossible leap with a rolling RECOVERY
landing in front of Finder who is still reacting to the

SNOWSTORM of money around him

KATO
Is this enough

She shuts the computer puts it back in her shoulder case

SARAH

(continuing)
What do you mean no Do you
realize how big this -

But then she realizes that Tony is not shaking his head he
is twitching because (as we see now) he has been STUCK in
the BACK by a knife He falls over into Sarahs arms dead
At the same moment the BULLETS begin to ring out

SARAH

(continuing as she

draws to Fields)
Get down

NEW ANGLE

Fields doesnt need to be told twice She DIVES inside the
car cowers in the footwell Sarah lets poor Tonys body
absorb two BULLETS as she makes her way behind the open

recover his gun while Diggs covers him

Diggs runs forward rattled

something up above - something leaping from one side of
the alley above her to the other -

running AWAY from lens toward A WROUGHT IRON GATE Just
as Diggs glances over his shoulder (toward us) Kato drops
down behind the iron fence And - RIPS IT OUT OF THE
GROUND

REVERSE ANGLE

Diggs turns just in time to SEE this - raises his gun and-
SIDE ANGLE

Gets impaled on at least six of the metal spears at the
top of the fence The fence QUIVERS like an arrow in the

SARAH

(ignoring this)
Oh Kato you dont know how Ive

COP
(stunned)

Kato YANKS the wires They pull out the end of the Taser
and the battery overloads shocking the cop Another COP
JUMPS him from behind gets one handcuff on Katos wrist
Kato whirls FLINGS the guy overhead like a baseball The
handcuff chain SNAPS and the guy bounces down an escalator

But now the security guards and the hospital orderlies have
recovered and have joined the cops and suddenly theres
seven eight nine men swarming over Kato clubbing him
tackling him-

While still trying to hide her face she manages a little
wave

BATISH
This is a hospital not a hotel

Ishmael Hes wearing a walkman thats playing Sousa marches

KATO
(continuing)

Ishmael Then you were real
ISHMAEL

Something gleams in Ishmaels hand A scalpel

ISHMAEL

The SCALPEL saws through the long sleeves of the strait
jacket

Kato looks at Ishmael carefully

KATO
I think I think youre crazier

armed and dangerous and you are
authorized to use deadly force
Now we dont have a photograph

somewhere nearby is approaching Now he passes out
xeroxes of an artists sketch of Kato
SERGEANT
