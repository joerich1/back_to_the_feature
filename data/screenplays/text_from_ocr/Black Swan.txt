1 INT DARK STAGE - NIGHT 1
OPENING CREDITS
A SPOTLIGHT slices black space
In its beam a DANCER materializes She is fair-skinned
Beautiful and pure
The maiden twirls on pointe a smile on her face light as
air and carefree
She pauses her face grows worried Sensing someone
watching
Scared she peers into the darkness
She moves now looking growing more frantic
Then a SINISTER MAN emerges out of the darkness behind
her
She stumbles backwards frightened
She tries to escape twirling away but he pursues His
true
form is revealed the demon ROTHBART
He flings his open hand towards her casting the spell
She wants to scream but nothing comes out She looks at
her

body sensing something happening to her Something
terrifying

She spins panicking but its too late She disappears
beneath the beasts cape
SWAN

She

as

She emerges as the WHITE SWAN the iconic protagonist of
LAKE

CUT TO BLACK

2 INT NINAS BEDROOM - MORNING 2
In the darkness a pair of EYES They belong to NINA the
same dancer She lies awake in bed thinking about her
The room looks like it hasnt been redecorated since she
a teenager Stuffed animals Dolls Pink and frilly

The door opens throwing LIGHT on her face Nina looks
towards the door and smiles softly at whoever opened it

Nina sits up and hangs her BARE FEET off the side of the

Like all ballerinas shes beautiful and her feet are
atrocious Covered in corns broken blisters and bunions

arches them doing her first extensions of the day

3 INT LIVING ROOM - MORNING 3

The room is empty of furniture to leave space for dancing
large mirror covers the opposite wall entirely

Nina rubs her knees to get them warm and then begins her
morning exercises extending and contracting her feet and

legs in precise and rhythmic motions

The skin on her chest stretches tautly over her sternum
Defined vertebrae run up her back sinewy muscles contract

she moves Her slender neck leads into her hair contained
in a ballerinas bun

Nina looks serene as she moves completely in her element
She hears someone fussing about in the kitchen

NINA

(WHILE STRETCHING)
I had the most amazing dream last
night I was dancing the White
Swan
No answer

NINA (CONTD)
Different choreography like the
Bolshois It was the prologue
when Rothbart casts his spell

Still no answer

Nina continues to stretch

4 INT KITCHEN - MORNING 4

Nina sits at the table An older woman ERICA places a
POACHED EGG and a QUARTER-GRAPEFRUIT in front of her

ERICA
Youre in a good mood

NINA

ERICA
Off-season always makes you grumpy

NINA

(RE GRAPEFRUIT)
Look how pink So pretty

They giggle and Erica resumes packing Ninas shoulder bag
with extra clothing shoes snack filled tupperware duct
tape ribbon thread etc

NINA (CONTD)

ERICA

most dedicated dancer in the
company

Nina smiles comforted and begins taking her vitamins

way

Erica walks over with a SWEATSHIRT and holds it above her
Nina pulls it over her head and starts to push her arms
through the sleeves

ERICA (CONTD)
(NOTICING SOMETHING)
Whats that

NINA

ERICA
There

Erica points to her shoulder Nina feels and finds a small
SCRATCH MARK

She shrugs and shakes her head
Erica gives her a suspicious look but lets it go and
Nina finishes pulling down the sweatshirt

Erica hugs Nina into her chest and kisses the top of her
head

ERICA (CONTD)
Sweet girl

Erica releases her and Nina begins eating

5 INT SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY 5
Nina rides inside a crowded subway staring absentmindedly
her faint reflection in the trains window

Suddenly another train roars by on the opposite track
snapping her awake

In the next train car she sees the back of a BALLERINA
standing in the midst of the crowd Her head bops to music

playing through iPod earphones

Nina moves a strand of hair out of her eyes and at that
exact moment the girl in the next car moves in the same

Mirroring her
girl

They

bags

to

gossip

Unnerved Nina slowly lowers her arm So does the other
Although Nina cant quite see her face the girl seems
IDENTICAL from Ninas vantage point

The train jerks to a stop as it arrives at a station Nina
sees the girl head to the exit She cranes to see her face
but her views obscured

The doors slide shut and the train pulls out Nina watches

the platform whisk by keeping her eyes peeled but she
doesnt see the girl

7 EXT LINCOLN CENTER - DAY 7
Nina emerges from the subway station onto a city street

She arrives at the MAJESTIC-LOOKING THEATER where a few
other BALLERINAS likewise trickle towards the entrance

all look strangely similar slender carrying shoulder
wearing leggings and loose sweatshirts

She passes a ROW OF POSTERS featuring the companys prima
ballerina BETH MACINTYRE

Nina looks at them a little envious before continuing on

the STAGE DOOR

8 INT SOLOIST DRESSING ROOM - DAY 8
Crammed into a single dressing room Nina and the companys

SOLOISTS get ready for rehearsal Chatting sewing ribbon
onto shoes applying makeup putting band-aids on blisters

Nina removes a new pair of BALLET SHOES admires them for a
moment before cutting off the satin toe with scissors

In the background catty VERONICA and Russian GALINA

VERONICA
Cant believe shes back
GALINA
Of course she is

VERONICA
She cant take a hint Companys

SOLOIST 1

VERONICA

Irked Nina starts POUNDING the shoes against the floor to
down

The

soften the toe

Her eyes are drawn to a NEW GIRL standing in the doorway
Nina pauses to scrutinize her She wears vampy make-up hair
down Dark and sexy

NEW GIRL
Soloists

Wary the girls mumble mmm-hmms and nod

NEW GIRL (CONTD)

Great

She slinks past the suspicious group of girls and plops
at an open spot

NEW GIRL (CONTD)

Fucking got off the wrong stop and

had to hoof it from 79th

Nina exchanges glances with the other girls taken aback

The new girl notices the looks smirks to herself and

getting ready

9 INT LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 9

Nina wears a look of intense concentration as the entire
company warms up including the pubescent CORPS MEMBERS and

handful of MALE DANCERS

LEGS HANDS and FEET repeat the same movements all around
her led by a severe BALLET MISTRESS

BALLET MISTRESS

To the back fondu to the back
plie Fourth fourth and one and
fifth to the back

(to a corps member)

Like this Push it Why cant you
do this

Using the mirror Nina monitors her movements carefully

mistress surprises her
kisses

BALLET MISTRESS (CONTD)
It needs to be looser Relax Let
it flow

Flustered Nina nods and tries to follow her instruction

Suddenly the girls around Nina begin stripping off their
sweatshirts and insulated pants

Nina sees that the intense and brooding director of the
company THOMAS LEROY has entered the space He has the
unkept look of an artist Magnetic and intense

The ballerinas remove their warm-up gear to show off their
bodies

Leroy walks around the room judging his flock Smiles and
glances are thrown his way

He goes up to the ballet mistress takes her hand and

her on the cheek Even she manages a smile

He heads to the line of soloists studying them

LEROY
We all know the story virginal
girl pure and sweet trapped in
the body of a swan She desires
freedom but only true love can
break the spell

He taps a dancer on the shoulder she lights up He walks
then taps another A selection process of some kind

Nina looks nervous has an inkling of what it means

LEROY (CONTD)
Her wish is granted in the form of
a prince

He nears Nina She sneaks peeks at him eager and hopeful
He acknowledges her with a small nod and a smile

But he walks on without tapping her She deflates

LEROY (CONTD)
But before he can declare his love
her lustful twin the Black Swan
tricks and seduces him
He approaches the New Girl Nina watches threatened
But he doesnt tap her either

LEROY (CONTD)
Devastated the White Swan leaps
off a cliff killing herself But
in death finds freedom

He taps one more soloist and then CLAPS
The music stops and all the girls face him attentive

LEROY (CONTD)
Good morning company

They respond Good morning in nervous unsure voices

LEROY (CONTD)
We open our season with Swan Lake
Done to death I know But not like
this We strip it down Make it
visceral and real

He pauses for effect

LEROY (CONTD)
And a new production needs a new
Swan Queen A fresh face to present
to the world

Surprised the soloists glance at each other trying to
keep
their cool

LEROY (CONTD)
But which of you can embody both
swans The white and the black

Nina prepares for disappointment

LEROY (CONTD)
All the soloists I touched
Please go to your scheduled
rehearsals this afternoon

The girls are confused
LEROY (CONTD)

And the girls I didnt touch meet
me in studio B at five
ones

fury

out

down

Nina breathes realizing the girls he didnt tap are the

hes selected purposefully toying with them

10 INT BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY 10

Hidden inside a nook Nina has her eyes closed nervously
HUMMING the score to Swan Lake

She makes small motions with her feet and hands going
through the choreography in her mind Preparing for the
audition

A loud CRASHING sound snaps her out of it

She goes out into the hallway to investigate

The door to a PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM is halfway open Nina
cautiously approaches

Inside she can see someone moving around the room in a
trashing it

Suddenly the door swings open and BETH MACINTYRE bursts

She makes brief eye-contact with Nina
BETH
What

Nina just shakes her head
Beth scoffs as she slams the door behind her She clips

the hall in the opposite direction

Nina waits until shes gone then moves closer to the door
and peeks inside curious

She checks to make sure no ones around and quickly enters

11 INT PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - SAME 11

Large and comfortable Beths presence is everywhere
Photographs clothing and personal belongings scattered
across the space
how

flowers

Variation

be

Nina looks at herself in the mirror and smiles imagining
great it would be

Then she notices a LARGE VASE lying on the floor The
have been shredded water everywhere

She moves to the vanity counter and touches Beths
belongings in reverence The items are neatly laid out
ballet supplies jewelry and makeup

Her fingers brush a tube of LIPSTICK She picks it up

Nina slips the lipstick into her bag and exits the room

12 INT PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 12
In the middle of her audition Nina dances Odettes
from Act II of the ballet a frightened look on her face

Although her movement is incredibly precise theres a
definite vulnerability Exactly as the White Swan should

fear tinged with melancholy
Leroy waves his arm The music and Nina stop abruptly

He approaches her and when he gets close taps on her
sternum with two of his fingers

LEROY
So Nina would you like to be the
Swan Queen

NINA
If you want me to be

He leans in and talks softly so the other girls cant hear

LEROY
Well if I was just casting the
White Swan shed be yours

She cant help but smile flattered He pulls away from her

LEROY (CONTD)
But Im not
to

He turns to the PIANO PLAYER

LEROY (CONTD)
Maestro Odiles Coda

The piano player rifles through the song book

LEROY (CONTD)
Show me your Black Swan Nina

Nervous she glances over at Veronica and Galina who
anxiously await their turn

She takes a few breaths then looks towards the piano player
and nods

The music begins

Nina dances a few steps and then launches into the most
difficult and famous part of Swan Lake The Black Swans
Coda It consists of 32 consecutive fouettes (spins)

LEROY (CONTD)
Come on not so controlled

The music builds in intensity she pushes herself into the
next turn

LEROY (CONTD)
Seduce us Not just the Prince but
the court the audience the entire
world The fouettes are like a
spider spinning her web Come on
Attack it Attack it

Leroy runs his hand through his hair dismayed

A look of worry spreads across Ninas face Knows shes
blowing it

The door CLANGS open and throws Ninas focus completely She
stumbles several spins short of finishing

The New Girl obliviously marches into the room listening
an iPod
LEROY (CONTD)

(SARCASTIC)
Good of you to join us
The New Girl notices everyone staring and pulls out her
earphones to talk

NEW GIRL
Sorry

LEROY
Girls this is Lily Straight off
the plane from San Francisco Shes
filling Rebeccas old spot

LILY gives a small wave Nina eyes her with scorn as she
catches her breath

LEROY (CONTD)
Go on get warmed up

LILY
Im good

Lily starts stripping off her layers revealing her lithe
body On her back she has a TATTOO OF LILIES

NINA
Should I go again

LEROY
(distracted by Lily)
Ive seen enough Thank you Nina

She looks down getting his meaning
LEROY (CONTD)
Okay Veronica Your turn The

White Swans variation

Furious Nina marches out of the room

15 EXT STREET - NIGHT 15

Nina walks along a quiet side street She clutches her
jacket for warmth and comfort

Her CELL PHONE starts ringing She digs it out of her bag
checks the CALLER ID MOM She silences it and puts it

Up ahead she sees the sidewalk dead end at a construction
site and detour into an enclosed PASSAGEWAY beneath the
scaffolding

Nina slows a little scared but decides to push on

The passageway is dark The temporary lighting dim and
flickering

She walks quickly trying to get to the other side

She hears the sound of soft FOOTSTEPS approaching She
stops and the other FOOTSTEPS stop

She looks up and sees the faint outline of a SLENDER WOMAN
standing there almost ghostlike

Nina starts walking again keeping her head down and the
other woman continues as well

As they pass each other Nina glances at the womans face
discovers

The woman looks EXACTLY LIKE HER

But the moment passes as the woman continues walking

Nina stares after her perturbed

Her cell phone starts RINGING again piercing the silence

Nina continues out ignoring the phone

16 INT UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - NIGHT 16
Nina enters and locks the deadbolt and chain-lock behind

her
She turns and is startled to see Erica standing right
there
ERICA
How did it go
Nina looks at her confused Erica helps take off her coat
ERICA (CONTD)

the office An audition Cant

Nina sits up and retrieves a pair of point shoes from her
bag She considers them for a moment then starts to put

on

She stands takes a breath and does a single spin testing
the waters

She takes a breath and spins again then again then again
Each spin is punctuated by a jab of her foot into the
THWACK THWACK THWACK

She jabs her toe down hard

NINA
Ow

She winces in pain and automatically grabs her foot

ERICA (0S)
Everything alright

NINA
Im fine

Nina leans her back against the mirror and removes her
Her right big toenail has split oozing blood
Nina breathes through the pain and puts her shoe back on

She reassumes the position takes a couple breaths and
starts spinning again

Her toe jabs into the floor She winces a little with pain
but keeps pushing

Her face grows more determined focused 20 21 22

She starts to look powerful willing herself to succeed

At the end of the 32nd spin Nina jabs her foot down hard

slight smile of satisfaction

with PEROXIDE and dabs it on the split toenail Nina reacts
to the sting

completely lost

NINA

ERICA

wont convince him one way or the
other

Annoyed Nina lies down looking away from her mother

ERICA (CONTD)
Oh sweetheart I know its
disappointing When you start to
get older theres all this
ridiculous pressure God knows I

Erica squeezes some arnica gel into her palm and massages
into Ninas calves

ERICA (CONTD)
But its alright No matter what

Pas de Quatre again Thats such a
wonderful part Or maybe hell make
you a Big Swan Either way youll

NINA

Erica removes Ninas EARRINGS then opens a JEWELRY BOX
sitting on the night stand and drops them inside A TOY

Nina gets under the covers Erica tucks her in and sits down
on the edge of the bed

ERICA

stare

Insecure she looks like she wants to run out of the room

LEROY (CONTD)
All that discipline for what

NINA

He laughs

LEROY
Perfections not just about
control Its also about letting
go Surprising the audience
Surprising yourself Transcendence

He considers her for a moment

LEROY (CONTD)

NINA

Without warning he slowly plants a kiss on her mouth

It lasts for a moment but he suddenly jerks away

A sudden energy sweeps the room and she hears the sound of
scuffling feet and whispering Its up She just posted

The dancers start exiting into the hallway Veronica turns

NINA
Veronica

Veronica turns around Its hard but Nina decides to be a
good loser

NINA (CONTD)
Congratulations

see for herself

Knowing the outcome already Nina continues stretching in

deserted space resigned to her fate She finishes grabs
her belongings and walks out

She turns and sees Veronica her face flushed with anger
VERONICA (CONTD)
Your idea of a joke
NINA
(CONFUSED)
What
VERONICA
Fuck you
Veronica storms away
The group of girls stares at Nina making her very self-
conscious
Nina tentatively approaches the bulletin board to see what
Veronicas outburst was all about
First a few then more and more of the girls smile at her
They make room for her as she pushes through
She finally gets to the CASTING NOTICE finds Swan Queen
AND UNDERNEATH
NINA SAYERS
Stunned she turns around to face the mass of ballerinas

into a smile to mask her disappointment

crying
NINA (CONTD)

Nina hangs up and the tears really start flowing Shes
dreamt of this for so long its almost too much to bear

She wipes the tears off with the back of her hand and pulls
herself together She comes out of the stall

Horrified to discover WHORE written on the mirror in RED

Out of the corner of her eye one of the portraits seems to
shift Nina turns towards it but the paintings now
perfectly still

Unsettled Nina withdraws

29 INT APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT 29

Post-shower Ninas fuzzy reflection stares back in a steam
covered mirror

Nina takes her hand and wipes a streak across to see
more clearly

She looks nervous The enormity of whats in front of her
setting in

She turns side-to-side scrutinizing her body She lifts
arm and pinches the skin to check her weight

She notices a small cluster of RED BUMPS on her shoulder A
small RASH

She feels the bumps with her fingers bothered

She checks the same place on her other shoulder

Theres no rash just faint streaks of SCAR TISSUE
Nina slides the hamper in front of the door to block it

In the mirror now one of the bumps is scratched and
bleeding

Nina quickly wipes the blood off with her finger
The sound of the front door opening steals her attention

Nina exits the bathroom wearing a robe

In the kitchen she sees a CAKE with a lit SPARKLER sitting
on the table Her mother smiles anxiously

She opens her arms and Nina falls into a hug

She looks at the cake It has a ballerina sketched with
frosting Nina hides her disdain

NINA
Oh mom

ERICA
Its our favorite vanilla with
strawberry filling

Erica picks up a knife and slices into the cake

NINA
Just a little piece

Erica ignores her and starts cutting a very large piece

NINA (CONTD)
Thats way too much

ERICA
Its a celebration

NINA
My stomachs still in knots

ERICA

little isolated

DAVID (0S)
Hey there

Nina turns and sees DAVID the high-cheeked cocky dancer
playing Prince Siegfried

DAVID (CONTD)

David dances around the space miming a hunt with a cross-
bow
Nina enters stretches her body to illustrate her
transformation into human then sees David and acts

spooked

She dances away from him a scared look on her face
undulating her arms to resemble a birds flapping
David gives chase but Nina spins out of his grasp
disentangles from him
But he eventually snags her and they come very close
together
LEROY
Okay
The music stops Nina breaks out of character and looks at
Leroy anxious for his reaction
The Russian ballet mistress nods and smiles clearly
pleased

LEROY (CONTD)
Okay Nina Very good

Nina smiles relieved Leroy hops out of his chair and
approaches

LEROY (CONTD)
But I knew the White Swan wouldnt
be a problem The real work will be
your metamorphosis into the Black

in the crowd giving a sad smile to the surrounding guests

welcome another

identically dressed Little Swans glaring at her

Nina freaks jerking her body

Davids grip SLIPS and Nina SLAMS onto the stage

Its a horrific moment that feels like an eternity
Gritting her teeth Nina looks up around her sees the
of the other ballerinas Staring at her sadistically

Nina finds Lily glancing at David He snaps to and quickly
helps Nina up

And smashes her into the WALL LENGTH MIRROR shattering it
Shards fall everywhere

The Double flips Nina over and wails on her Punch after
punch

Nina does her best to block the onslaught

They scuffle knocking things over bumping into walls
The Double gets her hands around Ninas neck

Gasping for air Nina tries to pull the hands free but

too strong

Her hands frantically scramble along the surface of the
floor The fingers barely touch the edge of a MIRROR SHARD
but cant grasp it

The Double squeezes down

The blood vessels in Ninas eyes BURST again Her neck

to stretch unnaturally Strength surges through her body
she lunges

Finally grabbing the SHARD

And DRIVES it into the Doubles stomach

She stares at it for a long beat and realizes something

She touches her stomach and winces a little Pulls back her
hand Its coated with red liquid Blood

red spot The fabric is ripped at the center of the stain

She feels inside for confirmation
And discovers a stab wound in her own stomach

She notices a familiar face in the audience HER MOTHER

watches with a profound sadness tears streaking her

In the front of Ninas costume a dark circle has started
form Her blood fully seeping through

And Nina leaps

She slowly twists around in the air so that shes falling
backwards

She hears something Soft and muffled
The faint sound of applause

The sound of applause is now loud uproarious

A group of BALLERINAS surround the mattress clapping for
her each one dressed as a WHITE SWAN
