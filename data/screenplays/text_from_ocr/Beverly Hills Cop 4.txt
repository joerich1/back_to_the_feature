FADE IN

EXT ALLEY — DAY
BAM THWUP

A bullet buries deep into the back of an old shitty sofa
sending a puff of industrial stuffing out the other side

That puff is right near the face of RICO a bleeding Puerto
Rican guy hiding behind the sofa

RICO
(calls out)
I got nothin’ to say to you
fuckers

Pissed Rico sticks his gun over the couch and returns
fire

The CAMERA TRAVELS DOWN THE ALLEY passing three dead BODIES
near Rico’s couch blood still pooling on to the concrete

Down the alley Rico’s bullets PING off a dumpster Behind
the dumpster AXEL FOLEY crouches with his partner BILL
NESBITT

AXEL
(calls back)
You’re holed up behind a sofa
Rico How long you want to do
this

The dingy alley is crowded with old pallets and dumpsters
No way a car could get through it

The alley runs near the DETROIT RIVER which separates
Detroit and Windsor and the US from Canada It’s cold as
shit and ice floes make their way down the water

Even after all these years Foley still looks great The
edge to him that’s always been just below the surface is now
more pronounced

Nesbitt is a few years younger but looks like he knows his
way around a shit-hole neighborhood

They are loading bullets into the sleeves of their Glocks
while they talk
AXEL (CONTD)
(conversationally)
Hey Nesbitt your parents spank
you

NESBITT
Sure

AXEL
Mom or dad

NESBITT
I was a wait-until-your-father-gets-
home type of kid You

AXEL
Equal opportunity receiver

NESBITT
Belt or open hand

He keeps on feeding that sleeve with hollow points

AXEL
Whatever was within reach

BAM THWANG Another bullet bounces off Axel’s dumpster

AXEL (CONTD)
(yells at Rico)
You really wanna add cop killer to
your rap sheet Rico

RICO (0S)
Go to hell man

Axel just looks out over the river at the gray serene
skyline of Detroit From here the view isn’t all that bad

AXEL
Check out that view Nesbitt
Detroit at its best
(calls out)
Rico why you wanna come all the
way over here to Canada and leave
Rock City behind

RICO
You’re not allowed to follow me
here man It’s against the law

SIRENS can be heard in the distance
AXEL
(laughs)
Now you want laws Maybe you
should have thought about that
before you and your amigos eighty-
sixed the Darden brothers

RICO
Chinga tu hermana

AXEL
I don’t have a sister Nesbitt
here has a sister but she’s
married and gone a little soft

NESBITT
(calls out too)
She just had a baby You
definitely wouldn’t want to fuck
her

RICO
Fuck you then

FOLEY
Okay Rico You gotta get fuckin’
off the brain you know how this

is going to end Come out of
there and tell your story to a
judge

RICO

I trusted you

FOLEY
And you can trust we’re going to
get your ass back to Detroit

RICO
Fuck Detroit This is horseshit
You can’t extradite me

FOLEY
We’re not gonna extradite you
We’re gonna throw you in the back
of my partner’s rented Taurus and
drive you over the bridge

The CAMERA MOVES TO RICO who is breathing hard trying to
figure this out
RICO
(more to himself)
I knew you were police the way you
worked inside on me I should be
shot in my fuckin’ head

He gets uneasy because he doesn’t hear anything

RICO (CONT’D)
Foley

No response

RICO (CONT’D)
Foley you cop whore you there

Still no response

RICO (CONTD)
FOLEY

He peeks out from around the couch and his eyes go wide as
saucers The dumpster is rolling right at him Nesbitt
pushing it like a battering ram

Rico’s immediately on his feet fleeing toward the back of
the alley just as the dumpster SMASHES into the couch
sending stuffing flying

He gets to the end of the alley rounds the corner but
wasn’t expecting Foley to be there WHAM

Foley levels him with a pistol whip to the head smashing him
in the nose which cracks like an egg The six shooter
skitters down the sidewalk as Rico goes down in a heap

Parked nearby is a Ford Taurus rental Nesbitt presses a
button on the key ring and the trunk opens The street is
near the entrance to the AMBASSADOR BRIDGE connecting
Windsor to Detroit

They shove a groggy Rico into the trunk

WHAM Axel slams the trunk closed

Traffic rolls by the main street and Foley draws stares from
Canadians in their cars a black man tossing a Puerto Rican
into a trunk in Canada

One GUY rolls down his window

CANADIAN DRIVER
What you doing there eh
AXEL
Homeland Security

The SIRENS are getting closer
Just then Axel’s CELL PHONE rings

AXEL (CONTD)
Foley

INT LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - SAME

It’s early morning here and BILLY ROSEWOOD sits at a desk
downtown LA spread out in the morning light He’s at least
20 floors up He looks older grayer like the rampant
optimism we remember was driven out of him

BILLY
(whispered)
Axel Thank god It’s Rosewood

INTERCUT
AXEL

Billy How the hell are you man
Kinda early out there isn’t it

BILLY
Actually it’s late I’ve been up
all night chasing something down
and I need to talk to you

AXEL
You Up all night Thought you
had some cush gig that paid you not
to come to work

BILLY
They wish Youd be proud of me
Axel You should see how I got
these bastards on the run

AXEL
I’1l bet you do

Just then a trio of CANADIAN COP CARS SHRIEK around the
corner SIRENS BLARING bubble lights blazing kicking up
dirt and smoke in the street

Nesbitt’s eyes go wide as plates
NESBITT
Fucking Canuck’s Axel

We hear RICO’S MUFFLED CRIES from the trunk as he tries to
kick his way through to the back seat

AXEL
Hey uh Billy I gotta jump
man

BILLY

Axel wait

AXEL
I‘1l hit you back later I’m kind
of in the middle of something here

BILLY
Yeah but --

But Axel has already hung up

Billy hears something in the hallway and turns out his office
light He stands there completely quiet and sure enough
the creaking of the old floors of City Hall indicate that
someone is walking slowly toward his office

-but before we see who’s there were

BACK TO

WINDSOR

The cop cars bear down on the two Detroit cops like a swarm
of hornets as Axel dives into the Taurus and just gets the
engine cranked

AXEL
You sign up for insurance

NESBITT
I saw on Oprah it’s a rip-off

AXEL
(nodding)
Your credit card will probably
cover it

Rico’s still kicking from the trunk as Foley guns the engine
and manages to pull the Taurus out of there just as the cop
cars practically smash it off the road
He heads down a street flying past a sign with an arrow
pointing toward the border

FOUR MORE CANUCK POLICE CARS barrel out of nowhere cutting
them off

Foley throws the car into a slide and barely makes the turn
the original three cop cars still right on his ass

UP AHEAD

The border is at a standstill with long car lines backed up
for miles just to get on the bridge

ON THE ROAD

Jesus EVEN MORE CANADIAN POLICE CARS are blasting out from
everywhere like ants out of an anthill Foley just keeps
his head down and works the wheel like a madman

He somehow keeps in front of them rounds a corner coming
down a hill and spots the backed up traffic

FOLEY
Shit

With a final kick Rico smashes through the back seat from
the trunk

He’s met by Nesbitt’s waiting gun WHAM He’s knocked woozy
again

With no other choice Foley rockets the Taurus between the
cars waiting to go over the bridge smashing the sides of
most of them and popping side-view mirrors like balloons as
he continues up his newly-created lane

The cop cars follow through the new lane a few of the cops
hanging out the window and FIRING at the Taurus

FROM OVERHEAD

it looks like speedy beetles in a sea of dead ants making
their way toward the finish line Problem is the row
between the cars is getting narrower as they get closer to
the bridge With each WHAM it’s getting harder and harder
for the Taurus to fit through
ON THE ROAD

The cars are too tight now as FOLEY spots something ahead
He slams on the brakes and jumps out racing to a NURSING
HOME VAN next to him Hanging off the back is a WHEELCHAIR

Foley yanks the wheelchair off the back of the van while
Nesbitt realizes what he’s doing pops the trunk and
wrestles Rico into the awaiting chair

Foley and Nesbitt sprint toward the border outrunning the
still approaching cop cars

The border is close enough to see and the Canadian cops are
all forced to stop where Foley dead-ended the Taurus

Swarms of BP AGENTS rush at them from the border guns
drawn

BORDER PATROL AGENT
Stop right there

Foley and that wheelchair keep right on coming

AXEL
(digging for his badge)
Detroit Police

BORDER PATROL AGENT
Stop right there or I will drop
your ass into the river

FOLEY
I’m a cop goddammit

And with that he stops just over the line that separates
Canada from the lower forty-eight

Foley tries to catch his breath huddled over like an Olympic
sprinter who just finished the 100

From the wheelchair
RICO
(weakly)
I been kidnapped
Foley pops him with his gun to the nose again

FOLEY
Shut the fuck up
-which causes all the BP officers to level their weapons
at Foley Foley holds his gun up by the trigger guard still
breathing hard

FOLEY (CONTD)
Think you guys brought enough guns
the CAMERA MOVES UP WAY UP taking in the mess at the
border the smashed cars the hundreds of Border Patrol
officers surrounding this cop and we hear

-a driving hip-hop version of that familiar Axel Foley
theme kicks in

CUT TO
TITLE CARD

BEVERLY HILLS COP - 2009

EXT LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - MORNING

A pleasant morning in Los Angeles The CAMERA TRACKS OVER
from a sign that announces “Los Angeles City Hall” It makes
its way to the side of the building

---and something catches our eye the CAMERA FINDS IT
and

WHOOSH A body flies through an OPEN WINDOW 20 stories up
falling quickly through the morning air It lands with a
sick THUD on the sidewalk below chasing away pigeons

The shirt and suit look familiar like we just saw them
A WOMAN at a bus stop SCREAMS

CUT TO

EXT DETROIT STREETS - DAY
which is lost in the SOUND OF A CAR HONKING

Foley rides in a SQUAD CAR in the passenger seat while
Nesbitt drives and Rico sits cuffed in the back

Outside the car the serene image of Detroit from across the
river is shattered It’s a hard town with more businesses
closed than open Homeless men bangers and hookers hang on
the cold gray streets

Steam pours from the manholes and one wonders how it can be
this cold and still manage to be raining

One HOOKER waves at Axel who waves back

AXEL
Home sweet home Rico

RICO
Why don’t you go-the-hell back to
Beverly Hills Foley

NESBITT

(sarcastic)
Yeah man You went from the land
of milk and honeys to the land of
what the fuck am I doing here

(beat)
So what the fuck are you doing
here

AXEL
They decided they weren’t ready for
cops like me

NESBITT
Neither was Canada

Axel pulls out his phone and dials It just rings until
finally

BILLY
(recorded on the phone)
You’ve reached the voicemail of
William Rosewood Please leave a

message
AXEL

William
(he laughs)

Rosewood does your father know you
stole his name It’s Axel calling
you back Give me a shout when you
catch a minute

He clicks his phone off something not feeling right

INT DETROIT POLICE STATION - DAY

The station bustles with activity as Axel leads Rico through
the throng of cops criminals and visitors It’s a Zoo

Axel pushes Rico into the main bullpen area where a few
offices line one wall and the bulk of the desks are
haphazardly pushed together in the middle of the room

A TELEVISION in the corner of the room shows footage from the
“Shootout by the Shore” Axel stops at the TV to see
helicopter footage of himself and Nesbitt wheeling Rico
toward the border station

NESBITT
Look Rico youre on TV

DETECTIVE 1
You fucks back from vacation

DETECTIVE 2
Jesus Axel That’s a helluva mess
you fellas made over there

AXEL
We try to give Mulroney something
to bitch about

NESBITT
It’s good for his circulation

Another Detective stops by

DETECTIVE 2
Captain wants to see you Right
away

AXEL
(to Nesbitt)
What do you think A month’s pay

DETECTIVE 2
Even money on you losing your
shield

AXEL
Don’t do me any favors

He and Nesbitt head for the Captain’s office

DETECTIVE
Not you Nesbitt Just Axel

AXEL
Just me That’s fucking
discrimination

Nesbitt takes Rico as Axel heads off

NESBITT
I’ll tank him for you You might
be in there a while

INT CAPTAIN MULRONEY’S OFFICE - DAY

MULRONEY is a serious lifer From beat cop to Captain his
life has been nothing but serving as a Detroit cop

More footage runs in his office about the episode at the
border He rubs his temples as he watches it

There’s a KNOCK at his door and Foley sticks his head in

AXEL
Yo boss

Mulroney nods him in sadly Like Axel’s just too much to
bear

Axel spots the television where a REPORTER is going on about
a possible “international incident”

AXEL (CONTD)
International incident That place
is North Detroit

CAPTAIN MULRONEY
Axel close the door

AXEL

I seriously think we need to have a
talk with our Eskimo neighbors
about national

CAPTAIN MULRONEY
Axel

Foley tried but the time has come for him to take his
medicine

The Captain stands Axel shuts the door and braces for the
yelling but instead

CAPTAIN MULRONEY (CONT’D)
A guy named Taggart called for you
He wanted me to pass on some
information

Axel smiles surprised

AXEL
Taggart

CAPTAIN MULRONEY
Yeah He said your old partner
Billy Rosewood he died this
morning

This doesn’t quite register Axel’s confused

AXEL
I just talked to Rosewood We’re
playing phone tag is all

CAPTAIN MULRONEY
He uh jumped out of a window
early this morning I called the
LAPD personally and confirmed it

AXEL
Jumped out of a window

CAPTAIN MULRONEY
I’m really sorry

Axel sits down heavily

CAPTAIN MULRONEY (CONT’D)
Take some time Go to the funeral

AXEL
Shit This is fucking crazy

CAPTAIN MULRONEY
I’‘1l clean up everything here

AXEL
Yeah Yeah Thanks Captain

Moving like a ghost Axel stands and walks out of the office
stunned

CUT TO

INT AIRPLANE — DAY

Axel comes out of the bathroom slides by a FLIGHT ATTENDANT
in the aisle He sits in a coach seat

He looks around the cabin at the mostly sleeping passengers
Two BUSINESSMEN play gin obviously old friends Axel is
antsy his leg bobbing up and down

The flight attendant kneels down next to him

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Can I get you anything

Finally he notices her

AXEL
I’m sorry

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
I was just asking if you wanted
anything

AXEL
No thanks You can’t help with
what I need

She starts to leave

AXEL (CONTD)
How soon ‘til we land

She looks at her watch
FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Couple hours You want a pillow or

something

Axel just shakes his head and resumes waiting a lion ina
cage

CUT TO

EXT BEVERLY HILLS STREET - DAY

It’s a beautiful day on a bucolic street in the hills above
Beverly Hills The sun is out and the sky is blue One of
those MOBILE SPEED INDICATORS sits on the side of the street
A few Mercedes and BMW’s roll past 40 MPH 42 MPH

WHOOSH 122 MPH
A PAGANI ZONDA rockets past 600 horses of Italian fuck you

Inside is JOHNNY KAPS a 20-something Beverly Hills punk who
owns the streets without a care in the world

He downshifts and takes a turn onto Sunset engine screaming
from torque Then he punches the gas and the tires smoke
all this in front of a sitting Beverly Hills COP CRUISER

The COPS are stunned by the blur that just blew by and they
roll their “Energy Efficient Hybrid” onto the street after
the Pagani

Ahead Kaps has had to jam the brakes for a stoplight going
into West Hollywood The cops pull up behind him and flash
their lights

Kaps can’t believe it like someone hitting Sunset at 120 MPH
wouldn’t attract this kind of attention The two cops come
up on either side of his car

BEVERLY HILLS COP
Sir we’re going to need

-but before they can even get it out

JOHNNY KAPS
What the fuck guys

BEVERLY HILLS COP
Sir

JOHNNY KAPS
Whose fucking taxes do you think
pays for the shine on those shoes
huh

BEVERLY HILLS COP
(ever polite)
Sir please exit the car

JOHNNY KAPS
Go fuck yourself

Just then an LAPD CRUISER pulls up next to them and one of
the LAPD COPS leans out his window

LA COP
Everything okay Johnny

JOHNNY KAPS
Does everything look fucking okay

LA COP
(to the BH Cops)
You boys got a problem

BEVERLY HILLS COP
Only the speed this man was
traveling through Beverly Hills

LA COP
Look fellas we’re asking for a
little professional courtesy here
From one law enforcement officer to
another

The Beverly Hills guys want to stand up but they just don’t
have the balls Finally one of them nods an okay

LA COP (CONTD)
(to Kaps)
Have a good day Johnny

JOHNNY KAPS
Thanks fellas

Johnny revs the engine and is out of there leaving the
Beverly Hills cops choking on the smoke from his tires which
matches the SCREECH of

EXT LAX — DAY

a JET touching down on the runway

INT LAX BAGGAGE CLAIM - DAY

Axel comes down an escalator and eyes the chaos PEOPLE are
everywhere waiting for their luggage Axel just has a duffel
over his shoulder and makes his way over to a group of
CHAUFFEURS who are holding signs looking for their clients

Axel scans the row sees a couple of grey-haired DRIVERS
guys that look like they’ve been doing this a long time

Even though one has a sign reading “Washington” and the other
a sign reading “Tim Jones” he quickly dismisses them then
focuses in on one guy

-ELLIOT young just a skinny kid who looks like this is
his first day on the job He’s holding a sign that reads

“Beverly Hills Hotel” Scribbled beneath that is the name
“Rosenplatt” Axel moves in like a shark

AXEL
What’s up I’m Rosenplatt

ELLIOT THE CHAUFFEUR
(skeptical
Youre Mr Rosenplatt

AXEL
That’s right And I’m late

ELLIOT THE CHAUFFEUR
Late for what sir

AXEL
The best part of this damn town

Axel walks right past him and makes the driver chase after
him

CUT TO

EXT IN AND OUT BURGER - DAY

The black stretch limo can barely make the turn out of the
drive-through lane Through the open window Axel munches on
a double-double

He tosses a burger through the window to Elliot

AXEL
Eat up Elliot This one’s on me

ELLIOT THE CHAUFFEUR
Thanks Mr Rosenplatt

EXT BEVERLY HILLS STREETS - DAY
The LIMO rolls through the traffic of Robertson

BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE sit at the sidewalk cafes chatting making
shopping plans and comparing botox jobs

Axel looks out the window of the limo taking it all in
again slurping on his milkshake

On one corner a whacked out guy on skates dances to his own
beat

ELLIOT THE CHAUFFEUR
That crazy dancing skater guy been
around for years

AXEL
Been longer than that

Up ahead he notices a throng of PHOTOGRAPHERS hanging outside
the Ivy Just as the limo passes Axel sees a BLONDE STARLET
walk out of the store over-sized sunglasses on the
photographers fighting to get a shot

ELLIOT THE CHAUFFEUR
Everyone in this place looks 25
(beat)
No matter how old they are

Now it’s headed down Santa Monica and the limo passes the
familiar shield-shaped sign that announces “BEVERLY HILLS”
Axel gets a glimpse of the BEVERLY HILLS POLICE DEPARTMENT
Under these circumstances it’s bittersweet

Farther up the street the car enters a residential
neighborhood where MANSIONS fight a losing zoning battle to
the MCMANSIONS that are taking over

Axel eyes one particularly ugly Persian Palace shakes his
head

AXEL
Taste doesn’t come free with a
checkbook

The limo turns up the famous drive leading to the BEVERLY
HILLS HOTEL

AXEL (CONTD)
Some things never change

ELLIOT THE CHAUFFEUR
Lots of new trendy places opening
up these days It’s getting harder
and harder to keep the rooms
filled

AXEL
Is that right
EXT BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL ENTRANCE - DAY

The limo pulls up and a BELLMAN quickly opens the door for
Axel who climbs out

BELLMAN
Welcome to the Beverly Hills Hotel

AXEL
Thanks man

Just then MR BENJAMIN a black man and the obvious boss of
the drivers and bellmen runs up

MR BENJAMIN
(to the chauffeur)
Elliot Where the hell’s Mr
Rosenplatt His people just called
and said he’s still waiting at the
airport

AXEL
Hey man what’s your name

MR BENJAMIN
Henry Benjamin Head of
transportation and parking You
and I’ve got a problem

AXEL
Can you step over here for a
second

Benjamin does and Axel leans in close to him
conspiratorially

AXEL (CONTD)
Listen Henry I know I put you and
your man here in a spot and for
that I’m sorry I really am If I
were in a better mood Id pretend
to be a representative from Dubai
or some kind of an ambassador or
any of five hundred other grifts to
get past you and get me a nice
suite at your hotel

Benjamin eyes him suspiciously but there’s something winning
about Axel laying it all out

AXEL (CONTD)
But here’s the thing

He shows him his badge

AXEL (CONTD)
I’m a detective from Detroit
Yesterday morning a very good
friend of mine fell twenty stories
out of the top of LA City Hall

MR BENJAMIN
I saw that on the news

AXEL
Then you saw the police say it’s a
suicide

(MORE )

AXEL (CONTD)
But I don’t believe a lick of that
Someone tossed my friend out that
window and when I find that
someone he’s gonna wish his mama
never had him Because I’m gonna
fuck him up I’m as serious about
that as I’ve been about anything in
my life

Mr Benjamin can see he means it

AXEL (CONTD)
In the meantime I need a place to
set up camp

Slowly Mr Benjamin nods

INT BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY

The place is old school Beverly Hills Plaid pastel and
reeking of money Big chandeliers big flower arrangements
all just a little over the top

Axel looks around

A squirelly little Asian man simply known as Z is behind
the desk He’s dressed in something between a kimono and a
robe

AXEL
Excuse me Benjamin told me to
talk to you I’m in charge of
forward scouting for a certain
multi-hyphenate who’s going to be
here in a few days

Z
Who’s your client

AXEL
Look at me Who the hell you think
it is What’s your name

Z
Zeeeas in zebra

AXEL
Z Like the letter Okay great
Z My name’s Axel Foley I’m
gonna need the next three days to
check out the hotel your security
sample all the food

Z
This was not pre-arranged

AXEL
You think I got time to “pre-
arrange” every detail of my man
Diddy’s life You know what
Never mind How bout if we just
cancel and go stay at the
Peninsula They got no problem
with successful black men up over
there

Z and Axel stare daggers at one another Z blows out a deep
breath then turns to a BELLBOY

Z
Arrange a bungalow for Mr Foley

AXEL
Thanks Z Your understanding will
not go unnoticed

Z
Is there anything else we can do
for you

CUT TO

EXT CEMETERY - DAY

It’s a beautiful old place with huge trees green grass and
white stones reaching over the hills The hotel limo pulls
up Elliot at the wheel Axel exits and joins a massive crew
of COPS some in uniforms others in suits but all looking
very solemn

There’s an obvious separation between the BEVERLY HILLS COPS
and the LAPD who each have different dress uniforms

Axel watches the casket dropped into the ground He looks
over the crowd where one pudgy guy ETHAN GOODWIN early 20s
wears an ill-fitting Beverly Hills uniform and stands out
because he looks particularly distraught

DETECTIVE JOHN TAGGART meets Axel near the casket as the cops
start to disperse

TAGGART
(warmly )
Axel
AXEL
Taggart

The two men hug
Axel steps back and taps Taggart on the gut

AXEL (CONTD)
You having a baby

TAGGART
What can I say Had a knee
replaced last year Other than
that retirement’s been good to me
My wife and I moved up to Napa to
slow things down a little

AXEL
Nice Good for you Really

TAGGART
Billy’d love the fact you came all
the way out here to pay your

respects

AXEL
He called me you know Just
before

TAGGART

It’s not your fault Axel There
was nothing you or anyone could
have done

Taggart looks at the cops moving past them many of them
LAPD He’s obviously uncomfortable about something

AXEL
We both know Billy didn’t throw
himself out the window

TAGGART
Of course he didn’t But--

AXEL
But what

TAGGART
He had a tough job Axel The
police commission brought him over
to work on a joint task force to
oversee the cleaning up of the
LAPD

AXEL
Why’d they pick Billy

TAGGART
The Mayor wanted an outsider
Someone he could be sure wasn’t on
the take and would be honest about
what he found

Axel nods That’s Billy all right

TAGGART (CONTD)
There are a lot of guys who would
toss someone in that position out a
window Every low-life on the
street every dirty cop half the
supervisors and politicians in this
city

AXEL
So where do I start

TAGGART
I wish I could say Billy would
call me every Thursday but he
didn’t talk too much shop Said
I’d just worry and I should enjoy
myself

Axel looks at the service through narrow eyes

TAGGART (CONTD)
Axel anything you need I’m here
Just say the word I’d love to
take a shot at the guy who did
this

Just then an attractive reporter from the LA TIMES
STEPHANIE JAMES walks up to the two of them

STEPHANIE
Excuse me guys Stephanie James
I’m doing a write up in the Times
Either of you care to comment on
the Rosewood death

TAGGART
No We wouldn’t Leave us the
hell alone

STEPHANTE

I’m just doing my job here
Taggart

TAGGART
Your “job” is to air dirty laundry
no matter who it hurts

STEPHANIE
Maybe if you guys cleaned your
laundry a little more often you
wouldnt be afraid of me

Stephanie turns to Axel

STEPHANIE (CONTD)
Just give me a quote

AXEL
I‘1ll give you a quote I’m going
to kill the motherfucker who killed
Billy

STEPHANIE
(impressed)
Finally a little honesty in this
town

Stephanie smiles and walks off Axel eyeing her the whole
way

Taggart sees Goodwin walking by eyes on the ground

TAGGART
Goodwin Come meet Axel Foley

Goodwin stops His hair is longer than the other cops his
gut a little bigger from too many hours on couch in front of
an Xbox He certainly doesn’t fit in with the clean image of
the BHPD

Axel sticks out a hand

AXEL
How you doing

GOODWIN
I’ve been better Billy talks
talked about you all the time He
liked you A lot

AXEL
He was a good friend

Goodwin nods and walks off

TAGGART
Billy was like a father to the kid

AXEL
Damn good to see you Taggart
Wish it weren’t over this

TAGGART
If I were a few years younger I’d
be on the ground with you Axel I
swear

AXEL
I know old man You get back up
to wine country and leave the
ground to me I’1ll keep you posted
when I break this fucker open

AT THE LIMO

Foley walks to the car the funeral heavy on his mind He
hears a LAUGH near some other parked cars and spies some
MEMBERS of the LAPD near their cruisers looking anything but
sad Axel steps into the limo

ELLIOT THE CHAUFFEUR
Where to

The limo drives off leaving Axel alone

INT LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - ENTRYWAY - MORNING

When it’s Axel’s turn he pulls out his GUN and his BADGE
handing them to the COP working the table

AXEL

The cop looks over the badge then slides it down the table to
Axel but keeps the gun

AXEL
You forget something

The cop locks the gun in a box behind him

METAL DETECTOR COP
No firearms unless you’re LAPD

AXEL
I’m a cop

METAL DETECTOR COP

Pissed but unwavering Axel picks up his badge and walks to
the elevators

He checks out the building directory where a WORKMAN is
removing the “Billy Rosewood - Suite 2012” name from the
board

BUSINESSMAN
You going up

Axel scans the board and finds the office of the Police
Commissioner 25th floor

AXEL
Yeah Hit 25 for me there

Axel exits the elevator and walks through the glass doors
into the plush

I know it’s strange because he was
so much taller

Just then COMMISSIONER WAXMAN sticks his head out of the
office

COMMISSIONER WAXMAN
Karen do you have --

AXEL
Mr Commissioner I’d like to talk
to you about Billy Rosewood

COMMISSIONER WAXMAN
Are you a reporter

AXEL
You see a pen anywhere My names
Axel Foley

The Commissioner’s demeanor changes He obviously knows who
Axel is

COMMISSIONER WAXMAN
Right I have something to talk to
you about myself

Axel walks into the Commissioner’s

OFFICE

and plops down on the soft couch The office walls are
covered with LAPD commendations along with pictures of
celebrities

Before he can say anything Waxman spins a computer monitor
around to face Foley

COMMISSIONER WAXMAN
You’ve got a way with words
Detective Foley

Axel scans the screen it’s showing the LA TIMES website
Assistant Commissioner Death More Than Just a Suicide

The byline is Stephanie James

The commissioner puts on some glasses and gets his face close
to the screen reading more for effect than anything

COMMISSIONER WAXMAN (CONTD)
Let me read this for you
(reading)
Detroit PD Detective Axel Foley
has arrived in Los Angeles to
investigate the death of his old

friend Quote “I’m here to find

out the truth about what happened

to Billy Rosewood” End quote
AXEL

That’s the problem with insta-news
They don’t fact check What I
said was “I’m going to kill the
motherfucker who killed Billy”

COMMISSIONER WAXMAN
Mr Foley

AXEL
Detective Foley

COMMISSIONER WAXMAN
You’re not a detective here

AXEL
What are you doing about Billy

COMMISSIONER WAXMAN
We have security cameras on every
floor and he was alone when it
happened

AXEL
According to who

COMMISSIONER WAXMAN
According to me

AXEL
I want to see his office

Waxman folds his arms across his chest

COMMISSIONER WAXMAN
Not gonna happen

Axel stands up and moves over behind the Commissioner’s desk
looks out the window

AXEL
You and I both know he was tossed
out the fucking window What are
you covering up

Axel has his hands on the Commissioner’s credenza
where Waxman has various awards plaques his car keys cell
phone asecurity badge

COMMISSIONER WAXMAN

How fucking dare you I championed
the Mayor’s appointment of Rosewood
and was his biggest supporter He

had a tough job and was under a lot
of pressure You feel guilty about
that go back to Detroit and see a

goddamn shrink

AXEL
I have better ways to deal with my
emotions I promise

Axel’s eyes are level unblinking

Waxman sticks his head out of his office and says something
to his assistant then comes back in

COMMISSIONER WAXMAN
Then we’re going to have to assume
you’re going to interfere with LAPD
business

AXEL
Only if the LAPD stands in my way

Two LAPD cops show up in the door

COMMISSIONER WAXMAN
Mr Foley is visiting from Detroit
and has asked for a tour of the
station Would you officers make
sure he gets one Specifically
he’d like to see the tanks

LAPD 1
Yes sir

AXEL
You’re caging me

COMMISSIONER WAXMAN
This isn’t Beverly Hills
Detective You want to bully
someone you shouldn’t slap the
biggest kid on the playground

The two officers grab Foley and roughly throw some cuffs on
him Axel keeps his death stare right on the Commissioner
until he’s all the way out of the office

INT JAIL - DAY

Axel sits in the holding cell alone lost in his thoughts
He pulls his hand out of his pocket and we see that he palmed

the Commissioner’s SECURITY BADGE He turns it over in his
hands then puts it back in his pocket thinking and we

Goodwin pulls out of there

AXEL (CONTD)
You a rookie

GOODWIN
How can you tell

AXEL
You remind me of me

GOODWIN
Really

AXEL
No not really Maybe if you were
black poor and had a rap sheet
But you do remind me of Billy

We think that’s going to be it but Goodwin is fishing for
conversation

GOODWIN
You know Billy meant a lot to me
He was cool Really cool My
first day he took the time to buy
me a coffee and says this job is
all about changing people’s minds
That every day people see us and
think “cop shit don’t talk to
him run man get out of here”
You know

(MORE )
GOODWIN (CONTD)
But Billy told me to put a smile on
my face and help people any way I
can and then I’d see the change in
their faces

Axel smiles
AXEL

That sounds like Billy Take a

right here

GOODWIN
Yeah sorry

AXEL
Yeah look growing up on the
streets I figured something out
early The difference between
someone who can get shit done and
someone who can’t comes down to

GOODWIN

(excited)
Really Because I have that I
mean I’ve not given a fuck my

Taggart from the old days on the desk

Axel goes to the window that Billy flew out of and opens it
up He looks down and sees an awning below still smashed
from Billy’s body The faded chalk outline of Billy’s body
is still visible too

AXEL
(under his breath)
Billy Billy Billy

He moves into the center of the room thinking thinking He
looks at the bookshelves nothing of note

His eyes settle on the desk the drawer is partially open
just a quarter of an inch

Axel eyes it

He opens the drawer just normal files he flips through
one doesn’t see anything unusual He pushes the door shut
back to the quarter inch position looks at it again his
wheels turning

He stoops down and gets his arm into the drawer feeling
around feeling aroundNothing there He frowns

Axel stands and accesses the LAPD database on Billy’s
computer He types in Billy Rosewood The case officer’s
name is “Babcock”

Axel shuts it down and walks out

the interrogation and locks the door from the inside

BABCOCK

INTERROGATION ROOM

In the room Axel finds an El Salvadoran youth PLUTARCHO
tied to a metal chair face resembling a ripe plum The dude
can barely keep his eyes open

Axel sits down across from him as Babcock bangs on the door
from the outside Axel pulls out his CELL PHONE and takes a
quick picture of Plutarcho’s beat up face

Plutarcho has a FELIX THE CAT tattoo under his left ear
halfway up his neck

PLUTARCHO
What are you The good cop Cause

Goodwin

GOODWIN
Yeah Axel here

DEPUTY CHIEF LOWELL

AXEL
I needed to make a few stops first

Well welcome back

Lowell extends his hand and Axel shakes it

DEPUTY CHIEF LOWELL (CONT’D)
We’ve met before I was a rookie
when you were last here Turned
this department upside down

AXEL
I just helped clean up a mess

DEPUTY CHIEF LOWELL
Made as big a mess as you cleaned
up from what I remember

Axel shrugs

DEPUTY CHIEF LOWELL (CONT’D)
Apparently you haven’t changed very
much

DEPUTY CHIEF LOWELL (CONT’D)

The DETECTIVE is reading from the LA Times website

Detroit PD Detective Axel Foley
has arrived in Los Angeles to
investigate the death

AXEL
I’ve already read that I was
misquoted

Lowell takes off his glasses and sighs

DEPUTY CHIEF LOWELL
What are you doing Foley

AXEL
What any cop would do What you
should be doing

DEPUTY CHIEF LOWELL
Look I just want to be straight up
with you so you don’t get the wrong
idea Beverly Hills has changed a
lot since you were here Crime is
at a historic low for us You know
what the incoming calls are
Paparazzi are bothering a starlet
down at Cartier A neighbor wont
turn down his stereo A homeless
man wandered into Starbucks We’re
not the LAPD not the Detroit PD
Hell we’re not even the Santa
Monica PD things are calm
here

AXEL
If you were a rookie then you
must’ve been in Rosewood’s class

DEPUTY CHIEF LOWELL
(nods )
Billy and I worked together for 25
years

AXEL
So what are you doing about his
case

DEPUTY CHIEF LOWELL
It’s not our case Foley The
LAPD has made it clear theres
no evidence it was a murder and
it’s not our jurisdiction because
it did not happen in Beverly Hills

AXEL
(getting hot)
Who gives a shit where it happened
Someone killed one of your own

DEPUTY CHIEF LOWELL
There are strict jurisdictional
rules Detective Here we follow
the rules

AXEL
You’re not following the rules
you’re pussing out in the face of
the LAPD

DEPUTY CHIEF LOWELL
We’re hardly afraid of them
Detective But they do in fact
have us “surrounded”

AXEL
No disrespect Chief but that’s
bullshit

It’s all Lowell can do to keep his Beverly Hills cool

DEPUTY CHIEF LOWELL
Detective I gave you a get-out-of-
jail-free card because I know you
were tight with Billy But you
have worn out your welcome here

AXEL

Hey I get it You guys have
Paparazzi to follow

(beat)
--I’d just hope if I were thrown
face first out a goddamn window my
friends of twenty-five years
wouldn’t give a fuck about
jurisdiction

Axel doesn’t drop his eyes and he and Lowell just stare
each other unblinking Finally
DEPUTY CHIEF LOWELL
If you get arrested again youre
on your own

GOODWIN
Chief I

DEPUTY CHIEF LOWELL
Back to your desk Officer Goodwin
I’m sure the calls are piling up

With that he turns and walks away Goodwin looks
extremely uncomfortable Axel eyes him

GOODWIN
I should get back to my job

He starts to walk away

Not you too Goodwin

Right then Michelle hurries over with a file

MICHELLE

times Suspected gun trafficker

She turns and walks off
AXEL

How many times have you asked
Officer Clark out

GOODWIN
Asked her out You saw man she
works in facial recognition and
didn’t even remember my face

behind the counter a cute eighteen year old HISPANIC GIRL
and a humongous barrel of a BIG GUY standing in front of a
small door marked “Baflo” The girl makes tortillas

HISPANIC GIRL
Can I help you

Axel looks right at the Big Guy in front of the back door
AXEL
We’re here for the gats in the
back
The Big Guy eyes Axel

BIG GUY
You know the password

AXEL
The letter F the letter B and the
letter I motherfucker

The big guy gets a puzzled look on his face as he’s trying to
process this but before he can move

--all of a sudden the Hispanic Girl picks up a full coffee
pot and flings it at Axel

He’s able to deflect most of it but in the same motion fast
as lightning the Hispanic Girl slams a RED BUTTON on the
wall and screams

HISPANIC GIRL

Sshe doesn’t get much more than that out before Axel jumps
the counter and gets into it with the Big Guy

AXEL
(yelling as he’s fighting)
Get the girl Goodwin

Goodwin and the Hispanic Girl square off

GOODWIN
Hi My name’s Goodwin

HISPANIC GIRL
Chinga tu madre

She swings a knife at him He evades but is about to get in
trouble Axel notices turns and drops her with a right
cross Everything is happening so fast

The Big Guy has managed to get the back door open and is
trying to pull it closed from the other side but Axel wedges
his arm in there the same arm that got scalded by the
coffee

The pressure of the door is almost unbearable The Big Guy
turns and runs and

Axel and Goodwin head through the door that says “Bano The
bathroom door leads to a dirty little shitter with another
door that opens into

A TUNNEL

-lit by a few bare bulbs It’s creepy as shit in here but
Axel and Goodwin race on

GOODWIN
This isn’t all that cool Axel

AXEL
Just keep up with me Goodwin

At the end of the tunnel is a door that Axel pushes open to
reveal a

GUN DISTRIBUTION WAREHOUSE

-which is much bigger than they would have expected the
size of a football field with wall to wall WEAPONS and GUNS
It’s like a Home Depot except with crates of AK-47s ASSAULT
RIFLES and PISTOLS stacked everywhere

RED LIGHTS are flashing on the ceiling and an ALARM is
blaring as

-hundreds of LOCALS mostly Felix 22’s scramble around
piles of ammunition trying to get out of a warehouse door in
the back

Axel and Goodwin plow forward heading towards the back
door

when Axel leaps on to a crate and starts running down a
row of them so he can have a better vantage point as Goodwin
struggles to keep up below him

While he runs full out Axel spots someone rushing down a set

of stairs from an OFFICE toward the back

AXEL
That guy’s in charge

GOODWIN
Who

AXEL
Guy on the stairs

He keeps racing across crates while Goodwin sprints below
him

The guy on the stairs NANDO OJOS makes it down and heads
out the back as Axel leaps off the last crate and chases
after him Goodwin right behind

They sprint out

-into the night and spot Nando making a break for it on
foot heading down the alley and rounding a corner

Axel is in full stride now looking like a strong safety on a
full out blitz He catches up to Ojos and tackles him right
into a row of newspaper vending machines

Those machines are not a soft landing and the two of them go
down in a heap with Axel on top

Goodwin catches up to them as Axel turns Ojos over and we
immediately see how he got his nickname one of Nando’s
eyes lists upward while the other stays fixed on Axel

NANDO OJOS
What the fuck do you want

AXEL
Your boy Plutarcho said your place
served the best burritos in town

NANDO OJOS
You po-lice

AXEL
Naw I just need some guns

NANDO OJOS
Stupid motherfucker You caused a
lot of trouble here Why’d he send
you to the fucking barrio You
gotta go through the proper

channels
AXEL
Who
NANDO OJOS
You gotta talk to Johnny Kaps
man

Axel lifts Nando to his feet They start walking back toward
the alley accidentally-on-purpose ramming Nando into a light
pole with West Coast Chopper stickers plastered all over it

NANDO OJOS (CONT’D)
Fuck

Nando dabs at his now bleeding eyebrow

Goodwin spots THREE LAPD CRUISERS as they pull up to the
Burrito Stand

GOODWIN
Shit LAPD is here

NANDO OJOS
Ain’t nothin’ they prolly just
hungry

Axel sees BABCOCK step out of one of the cruisers the last
thing he needs is another run-in with him

Down the alley Axel sees Elliot’s LIMO rip around the
corner The Limo screeches to a stop in front of Goodwin and
Axel

NANDO OJOS (CONTD)
What the fuck

Axel and Goodwin hop in and the limo ROARS out of there

INSIDE THE LIMO

Goodwin is practically having a heart attack catching his
breath

GOODWIN
I need to start hitting the
elliptical machine goddamn
AXEL
(to Elliot)

How’d you find us

ELLIOT THE CHAUFFEUR
(calls out

I grew up in Oakland dudes You

The car heads out of East LA while

EXT BURRITO JOINT - SAME

Babcock heads into the Burrito Joint

INSIDE THE BURRITO JOINT

-and takes a look around his face surprisingly placid He
walks through the door in the back

INSIDE GUN WAREHOUSE
-and into the Warehouse
Nando approaches him from the exit in the back
NANDO OJOS
Fuck Babcock You shoulda been
here 10 minutes ago We just

had

BABCOCK
Closing you down Nando

BAM BAM BAM He rips three bullets into Nando’s chest
from a SILENCED GUN (not police issue for sure)

A few other LAPD cops walk in dragging a swollen and still
bleeding Plutarcho

BABCOCK (CONTD)
This is what happens when you talk

THWIP Another silenced shot and Plutarcho is dead
BABCOCK (CONTD)
(to his cops)
Everyone
In the WAREHOUSE Babcock leads his crew who are all
brandishing weapons The cops methodically walk through the
place shooting anyone they see

Officer Reeves saunters over

BABCOCK (CONTD)
Light it up

Reeves nods as another cop brings in a couple of GAS
CANNISTERS and starts pouring fuel everywhere
OUTSIDE

Babcock walks out to his squad car as the Burrito Stand and
the warehouse behind it erupt in flames

DISSOLVE TO

guard

AXEL

shrugs
CUT TO

SITTING AT A TABLE - LATER
Michelle looks great out of her police uniform

She sits across from Axel next to Goodwin they’re all in
mid-conversation Axel’s actually having a good time

pretty much for the first time since he found out the bad
news

Goodwins in the middle of a story

GOODWIN
(laughing)
-I look at Phillips and he’s
taking one step backward like he
wants to get stuck with anybody but
me but too late he’s my partner
So we climb in the car and were
supposed to not hit any cones and
then slide out and block this perp
(MORE )
GOODWIN (CONTD)
Phillips is riding shotgun and he’s
begging me not to fuck this up
just go slowly and not worry about
the time but don’t hit any cones

MICHELLE
Hahah That test was the worst

GOODWIN
I know So I’m driving along
going pretty slowly extra
careful

MICHELLE
And they swing the woman and the
baby out

GOODWIN
Yep they swing the cardboard cut-
out of the woman and the baby and
I’m trying not to hit the cones and
WHAM I plow over Beatrice and
little Timmy and the baby head
actually flies off and into the
passenger window right into
Phillips’s lap

Michelle is cracking up Axel even chuckles

AXEL
You beheaded little Timmy

GOODWIN

MICHELLE

time

GOODWIN

MICHELLE
Why do you think I work in facial
recog

GOODWIN
Hahahahah You too Hahahah

MICHELLE
At least you still get to drive a
car All I’m asking is for one
little bit of action

Just then the reporter Stephanie James approaches Axel
rises to greet her

AXEL
Everyone this is Stephanie James
with the LA Times

They nod at her as she slides in

AXEL (CONTD)
Reporters and detectives do the
same thing We both dig until we
get the answers we’re looking for

STEPHANIE
So what did you dig up Detective

AXEL
We just left a warehouse in the
barrio that was stacked to the
ceiling with guns

STEPHANIE
Guns

AXEL
The kind of guns that shouldn’t be
on the street

STEPHANTE
How does this relate to Rosewood

AXEL
Don’t know yet Have you heard
anything about high end weapons

STEPHANIE
Few weeks ago I was working on a
story A military vehicle loaded

with weapons was hijacked outside
of 29 Palms Marine Base

AXEL
Let me guess M9-Berettas and M870
12-gauge pumps right

STEPHANIE
That’s right But that’s not
all

AXEL

Chinese Type 56 rifles and RPGs
(off her surprised look)

We saw all those guns earlier

tonight

GOODWIN
Holy shit Axel how’d you pick
up all that

AXEL

Details man You want to be a
detective some day you gotta keep
your head on a swivel at all
times

STEPHANIE
Anyway the police report
disappeared and the LAPD’s lips are
sealed I tried to talk to the
Marines but they’re locked down
like it’s Fort Knox

Axel shakes his head like “damn”

STEPHANIE (CONTD)
Where’s this distribution center

AXEL
Can’t let you blow that lead yet

STEPHANIE

AXEL

MICHELLE

AXEL
Great Anything you got text to
Goodwin hereyou got his number

INT BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT
The limo pulls up and Axel jumps out
He heads inside the lobby where he is intercepted by Z

Z
Mr Foley I just received a call
from your employer’s publicist
wanting to set up a scout
Strangely they didn’t know who you
were

AXEL
That’s because Foley is my
undercover name It’s a music
business thing If I told everyone
my real name do you think I could
do my job

Z
I think you’re full of shit

Axel holds up a finger

AXEL
I’m gonna give you a chance to take
that back Z One chance

Z
I suggest you pack your bags Your
room will be cleaned in the
morning

Axel just hustles off

AXEL’S BUNGALOW

The place is like a luxury apartment right in the middle of
the hotel’s back garden

He gets dressed quickly swapping out his jacket for a
black T-shirt

-then he opens up his backpack and pulls out a pair of
GLOCKS Pops out the clips checks the sleeves then reloads
them and racks the chambers

He tucks both guns behind his back and then throws on a dark
jacket before heading out

EXT BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Axel waits patiently Goodwin swings up the drive He’s
dressed in black and driving a black Mercedes

Axel’s about to climb in when he spots Mr Benjamin over by
the valet booth talking to some of the bellboys

AXEL
Mr Benjamin I think I may have
overstayed my welcome here But I
wanted to say thanks

MR BENJAMIN
You found out who hurt your friend

Axel shakes his head

MR BENJAMIN (CONTD)
Then I guess thanks are premature

With that Mr Benjamin walks away

Axel watches after him and jumps in the Mercedes

EXT HIGHWAY 10 - DESERT - NIGHT

Goodwin drives up the highway

AXEL
Damn Goodwin This is some nice
wheels

GOODWIN

It’s my dad’s I swore I wasn’t
going to take anything from my
parents after I joined the force
but I did

(beat)
Hey Thanks for including
Michelle she’s a cool chick

AXEL
Hey manshe’s into youyou got
a lot to offer

GOODWIN
I don’t know about that

Axel looks sideways at him

GOODWIN (CONTD)
I mean I don’t give a fuck

AXEL
(shaking his head)
No Jesus you gotta give a
fuck about her you just can’t

GOODWIN
Axel I know I’m just messing
with you

Goodwin laughs

Right then they see a sign for 29 Palms and Goodwin throws
up his blinker

GOODWIN (CONT’D)
How are we supposed to get ona
Marine base Axel

AXEL
Where there are military bases
there are motels Find us the
shittiest one you can

EXT SEEDY MOTEL - NIGHT

Axel and Goodwin emerge from the Mercedes and head into
the

DINGY LOBBY

of a trashy hotel Goodwin looks reluctant to come into
contact with anything in the lobby Axel strolls up to the
one desk in the joint where a FAT MAN in a white shirt and
bow tie sits sipping on a cup of coffee

FAT MAN
Can I help you

AXEL
I’m looking for the Colonel

Goodwin can’t believe Axel’s brazenness The fat man just
blinks sleepily

FAT MAN
And who the hell are you

Foley holds up his badge

AXEL
I’m the goddamn secret service

The big guy gets a puzzled look on his face

-Axel pulls out a wad of cash and starts peeling off
hundreds

AXEL (contd) (CONTD)
That’s because I protect
presidents

FAT MAN
(re Goodwin)
Who’s he
AXEL

My accountant
Axel hands him a hundred dollar bill

FAT MAN
He’s with Tess 24B

EXT MOTEL - NIGHT

Foley and Goodwin stand outside Room 24B Axel listens to
the door then pounds on it with the palm of his hand

VOICE (0S)
Fuck off I’ve got 15 minutes

Axel pounds the door again This time a 60 year old marine
colonel comes to the door wearing black socks skivvies and
little else Behind him stands a 40-something prostitute
TESS She’s wearing a marine colonel’s shirt and hat and
little else

COLONEL
Can I help you

AXEL
Yeah You can stop fucking my
wife

The door slams in Axel’s face We hear the sounds of an
argument and a lamp overturned

Axel manages to force the door open He and Goodwin rush
into the cramped and garish fantasy suite A STROBE LIGHT
flashes and the bed vibrates as the Colonel scrambles out the
back door in his socks and skivvies

Foley stops and watches breathing hard Goodwin rushes up
behind him

GOODWIN
Aren’t we gonna

AXEL
Chase ‘em Hell no We just need
his uniform

Tess wearing only the colonel’s shirt seems to want an
explanation Axel pulls out his cash and she hands him the
shirt

CUT TO

EXT DONUT SHOP - NEAR MARINE BASE - NIGHT

Goodwins car is parked in the parking lot of a Winchell’s
donuts with a clear view of the front of the base

Surprisingly neither is wearing the Colonel’s uniform
just watching the front gate Goodwin is chomping on a
doughnut

GOODWIN
What’re we looking for Axel

AXEL
I’1l know it when I see it

Axel just keeps watching the front Mostly government sedans
or military vehicles turn into the gate

GOODWIN
You know everyone thinks it’s a
cliche that cops like doughnuts
but the truth is everyone likes
doughnuts

(MORE)

GOODWIN (CONTD)

I went a lot of years without being
a cop and I fucking loved
doughnuts The little circle is
fucking genius and I can’t figure
out why

Right then that Pagani Zonda we saw Johnny Kaps driving in
Beverly Hills rolls through the front gate followed by a big
Navigator

Axel perks up

AXEL
That look like it belongs here
Let’s go

MARINE BASE - FRONT GATE - NIGHT

Goodwin drives up to the window looking sheepish and Axel
leans across next to him

Axel flashes his badge

AXEL
Yo we’re with the police We
need to talk to someone here about
some shit

MARINE GUARD
What’s this concerning

AXEL
It’s concerning me talking to
someone with more fucking bling on
his uniform than you

The Marine guard looks pissed but backs into the security
booth and makes a call He emerges after a moment

MARINE GUARD
Roll into that lot over there and
do not get out of your car until an
officer comes to speak with you

AXEL
Thanks

They roll toward a

PARKING LOT

not far from where the Pagani is parked outside the
hangar

GOODWIN
Now what Cause kids from Beverly
Hills don’t do well at Guantanamo
Axel

Axel is looking out the front windshield at the Navigator

AXEL
Keep the headlights on

GOODWIN
Is that gunfire

Now they can hear it the familiar RRRRRRIIIIIIIIP of
machine gun fire

CUT TO

INT WEAPONS TEST FACILITY - NIGHT

Babcock stands impatiently as that Punk Kid we last saw
speeding in Beverly Hills is blasting away double-fisting a
pair of SOVIET PK MACHINE GUNS

There are racks of different types of assault rifles near
him along with a group of MILITARY PERSONNEL

Kaps fires the length of the hangar where SAND is piled high
taking the brunt of his shooting Even a dummy jeep is down
there and he’s practically sawing it in two

Kaps is going off like a fucking lunatic blasting away and
laughing maniacally

JOHNNY KAPS
(over the noise)
THIS IS LIKE HAVING THREE DICKS

RRRRRIIIIIIIIPPPPPPP

He tosses the gun at one of the Marines and grabs another
bigger RIFLE BOOM BOOM BOOM

The JEEP jumps like it’s been hit by a missile Johnny just
laughs a kid in a candy store Finally he lowers the
weapon tired

JOHNNY KAPS (CONTD)
Fuck fellas This is the shit

Babcock looks at his watch

BABCOCK
Time to go Johnny

Kaps smiles big grabs Babcock and the two talk as they walk
away

JOHNNY KAPS
Look I pulled out of the Cayman
banks and switched to a bank in
Jakarta that won’t double hit us on
the exchange rate I want you to
personally handle the transfer We
can’t have surplus falling off a
truck

BABCOCK
You accusing me of something

JOHNNY KAPS
These weapons are a new deal
Babcock I need THIS shipment to
get where it’s supposed to go

BACK TO

EXT MARINE PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Axel and Goodwin are still watching the car somber

Just then there is a TAP on Axel’s window Axel rolls it
down to find a MARINE MP OFFICER’S mug staring at him

MARINE MP
Step out of the vehicle please

They both do

MARINE MP (CONT’D)
Now what’s this concerning

AXEL
You guys got a laundromat around
here

MARINE MP

Excuse me

AXEL
Oh I thought maybe you needed to
clean up a dirty uniform

Axel reaches back into the car and pulls out the uniform
hands them to the MP who looks it over noticing the
Colonel’s insignia

AXEL (CONTD)
One of your senior officers
scampered out of a whorehouse
tonight

MARINE MP
Hmmm

AXEL
Now look I don’t want to turn this
into a jurisdiction thing
‘cause I know the military needs
all the pussy it can get with the
way shit’s going down in the
world but there was some
suspicious shit involving that
civilian car over there we
followed it to here

MARINE MP
That car

AXEL
Yeah right over there I need
to find out who’s driving it and
what the hell it’s doing on this
base

Just then Johnny Kaps walks out of the hangar flanked by a
few other thuggish looking men and head to the Pagani and
the Navigator one of the men we recognize as Reeves

They don’t see Axel and Goodwin (or do they) and climb into
the truck

AXEL (CONTD)
(quickly)
You know what We’re not gonna
press charges boys will be boys
God bless America

MARINE MP
Well thank you officer

AXEL
Detective Foley Later

Axel and Goodwin hustle back into the car and follow the
Navigator out leaving the Marine MP addled

OUTSIDE THE BASE - IN GOODWIN’S CAR

They tail the Pagani and Navigator which is a little out
in front of them

GOODWIN
Holy shit Axel I know that guy

The Pagani turns right but the Navigator turns left

AXEL
Stay with hot wheels

Goodwin does they follow behind discreetly

AXEL (CONTD)
What guy

GOODWIN
The kid driving ahead of us I
went to high school with him
Beverly Hills High his name is
Jonathan Kaplan

AXEL
Get the fuck outta here Johnny
Kaps is Jonathan Kaplan from
Beverly Hills

GOODWIN
Head on a swivel I went to his
bar mitzvah I mean I knew he
sold some good pot in high
school

WHAMMMMM The Navigator comes out of nowhere and SMASHES

into Goodwin’s Mercedes sending it rolling like a bowling
ball down a steep hill until it WALLOPS a brick wall and

then spins sideways on the pavement

Dazed Axel looks over at Goodwin who is equally shook up

AXEL
Goodwin you okay

GOODWIN
Yeah I think

And just as suddenly their two doors are thrown open

AXEL
What the fuck

and they are yanked out as BLACK BAGS are whipped over
their heads

FADE OUT

EXT GRIFFITH PARK - NIGHT

The bags are ripped from their heads and they find themselves
tied to metal folding chairs facing each other their heads
already bruised and bloody from the initial crash

They are in a forest way up toward the top of a hill This
is fucking odd Behind them looms the Griffith
Observatory the only light is from the parked nearby
Navigator

In front of Goodwin and Axel are three thugs RIENSTRA
POTTER and the one we’ve met Reeves

REEVES
You dumb fucks

Axel struggles against the chains but he’s wedged in tight

REEVES (CONTD)
You just gotta keep sniffing at the
cheese don’t’cha You know what
happens to rats who keep sniffin’
at the cheese They get their
necks snapped

AXEL
Shit not in Detroit In Detroit
the rats wear the fucking traps
around their necks like trophies

Reeves assesses him Then
REEVES
Fine you wanna rumble We’11

rumble

He moves over to the Navigator pops the trunk and pulls out
an IRON CHAIN

Several of the links have been filed down and twisted to
point outward like little spikes The shit looks like
it’s out of the Inquisition

Reeves carries it back over to the circle of light so
Goodwin and Axel can get an eyeful He twirls the chain a
bit like he’s getting used to the feel

RIENSTRA

Hold up Reeves Babcock wanted
us to bring ‘em here and wait for
‘im He needs to find out what
they know

REEVES

I’m just gonna tenderize the meat a
little bit

Rienstra and Potter look a little uncomfortable but Reeves
is undaunted

REEVES (CONTD)
(re Goodwin)

Now we could start with this bitch
here because we know he’s gonna
roll like a brand new tire

He’s twirling that chain

REEVES (CONTD)

But what would the sport be in
that You go out fishing you
don’t wanna catch a little perch
you want something that’s gonna tug
on the line put up a struggle
you want a big fuckin’ marlin
fightin’ ya all the way into the
boat

He smiles at Foley

REEVES (CONTD)

And that’s you Mary Lou

He moves toward Foley and all we get next is a series of
merciful images

merciful
is doing to

Instead we
Axel’s feet
starting to

because we sure don’t want to see what that chain
Axel

see Goodwin struggling against his bindings
tightening waiting for each blow sweat
form on Reeves brow

The two other cops can’t watch much more of this they head
toward the Navigator

Axel’s metal chair collapses underneath him and he’s left
there a lump on the ground

Reeves turns to Goodwin

REEVES (CONTD)
I guess the stories about Axel
Foley are true He’s way too
fucking tough for Beverly hills
(beat)
So how about you kid How long
can you go

Goodwins fear is apparent He’s in way too deep and this is
all too much

But he looks at Axel on the ground bleeding and fucked up
but still holding his dignity and then

GOODWIN
Ask your girlfriend

Reeves’ face snaps from a smile to a frown Now he’s
pissed

WHISTLE WHAM WHISTLE WHAM WHISTLE WHAM Over
and over again

But then rising up behind the behemoth is Axel his face a
mask of blood He’s fisting a sharp leg of the busted metal
chair gripping it like a prison yard shiv and

-WHAP He plunges it five inches deep into the side of
Reeves’ neck

Blood immediately starts to squirt free as Reeves stumbles
trying to breathe blood coming out in streaks and then he
falls leaving Axel and Goodwin to look at each other
They’ve both seen better days

GOODWIN (CONT’D)
Axel

Here come Rienstra and Potter from the Navigator eyes
wide they can’t believe what they just saw

Axel’s already rooting around in Reeves’s jacket he comes
up FIRING

BAM BAM BAM

-and Rienstra and Potter drop where they stand Axel
hurries to untie Goodwin

Goodwin finds his feet

AXEL
You took some hard-core shit
Goodwin I’m impressed

Right then they hear CARS approaching

AXEL (CONT’D)
Let’s move

and just as a trio of LAPD unmarked sedans ROAR around the
corner

Axel hops behind the wheel of the Navigator while Goodwin
falls into the passenger side He throws the SUV into gear
slams on the gas and rockets the car out in front of the
sedans

UP AHEAD

A flanking sedan tries to cut him off but he threads the
needle and makes a turn up the hill and out of the park onto
the pavement in front of Griffith Observatory

IN THE NAVIGATOR

Axel mashes the pedal and heads further up the Hollywood
Hills

He races the SUV up into the middle of these narrow pathways
tires screeching around corners the sedans right on his
heels

UP AHEAD

Another police sedan suddenly comes out of nowhere to cut the
Navigator off but Axel doesn’t hesitate just plows full on
into the side of him pushing pushing

until he pushes the sedan right off the street and it
starts toppling down the hill end over end like a football
until it smashes into some poor schmuck’s front door

GOODWIN
(watching)
Damn

IN THE HILLS
Axel keeps racing the Navigator making pinpoint turns like
the tires are velcroed to the road getting as much distance

between him and the sedans as possible

Axel looks at one particular house with big wooden beams
holding it out over the edge of the cliff

AXEL
No way I’d ever buy a house on
stilts

He steers the car around another turn and then has to play
chicken with a sedan trying to ram him

At the last moment he zigs and the sedan’s driver guesses
wrong and zags and

-the Navigator barely passes him like a matador working his

cape

DEEP IN THE HILLS

The Navigator keeps working the road still a couple of
sedans on his ass

Axel keeps looking out the driver’s window trying to judge
the slope of the cliff

AXEL
It’s really not that steep

GOODWIN
Oh you’re not thinking about

AXEL
I’m telling you it’s a nice grade

GOODWIN
Oh Jesus Christ

--and before he can get his prayer out Axel jerks down the
wheel and takes the Navigator off the road and down the
nearest hill

IN THE NAVIGATOR

He’s doing all he can to maintain some semblance of control
over the car as

ON THE HILL

-the car bounds down the incline like a skier flying out of
the starting gates

BEHIND THEM

Two of the sedans must be driven by lunatics cut from Foley’s
cloth because they turn off the road and pursue the chase
FROM THE AIR

It looks like three streaks cutting down the side of a
mountain heading for a row of MANSIONS

IN THE NAVIGATOR
Goodwin sees the million dollar homes coming up fast
GOODWIN
You see the houses right Tell me

you see the --

No time for an answer because

ROW OF MANSIONS

Axel fights the wheel to somehow force the Navigator to
take an angle where it will miss the houses and bounce
between them

AXEL
Hooo-ld on

He manages to barely split the gap and while one of the
chasing cars takes the same angle

the other misses and smashes into the side of one of the
mansions

It’s just them and one pursuing car

IN THE BACK YARD

The Navigator is completely out of control now as it bounces
past the mansions and into someone’s back yard where

-holy shit there’s a big Olympic sized swimming pool cut
into a deck on the side of the hill

Axel sets his jaw this is the end of the line but
somehow

-the Navigator just happens to take the right bounce and
misses the pool completely going over the top of it

Not so lucky for the pursuing undercover sedan though

it crashes nose-first smack-dab into the middle of the
pool which causes the deck to disintegrate pulling the
house on stilts with it and the whole sorry mess slides like
an avalanche down the hill

BELOW

There’s no controlling the Navigator now as it gets to the
bottom of the hill and flips over into a road-side ditch
where CITY WORKERS are in the middle of picking up weeds

They can’t believe what they’re watching

IN THE NAVIGATOR

The doors are smashed so Goodwin and Foley kick out the
shattered front windshield

AXEL
Can you move

GOODWIN
Don’t worry about me

They scurry out of the front of the car and

AT THE BOTTOM

-rush over to where the city truck is parked They quickly
climb inside

AXEL
Fellas Id watch my head if I were
you

The city workers turn and look up the hill to see a mass of
house and deck and pool tumbling down at them They scatter
as

IN THE CITY TRUCK

Axel pulls down the visor the keys drop into his hand he
throttles the engine and just like that they disappear
down the road just ahead of the sliding mass of house

WAY UP THE HILL

Babcock is in one of the sedans that didn’t try to make the
suicide run down the hill He watches sneering as far
below Goodwin and Axel make their get-away

CUT TO

EXT BHPD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

The city truck is parked next to a row of Hybrid BHPD
cruisers

INT BEVERLY HILLS POLICE DEPARTMENT - CORRIDOR - DAY

Goodwin and Axel walk down the corridor faces busted up
looking like stark contrasts to the clean surroundings of the

BHPD

They stop at Michelle’s door in facial recog She gets one
look at them

MICHELLE
Oh my God what happened to
you

AXEL

We’re fine But we need some
information quickly

MICHELLE
I’ve been digging on Johnny Kaps
but I

GOODWIN
Try Jonathan Kaplanused to live
off Benedict Canyon His dad was
my orthodontist Doctor Stu
Kaplan

MICHELLE
Okay okay let me run

Just then Deputy Chief Lowell comes rushing up four other
BHPD detectives right behind him

DEPUTY CHIEF LOWELL
What the hell have you two been
doing I’ve got an All Points
Bulletin saying

AXEL

uncovered LAPD in bed with a gun
runner named Johnny Kaps

GOODWIN
Jonathan Kaplan

AXEL
Jonathan Kaplan He buys cheap
weapons including a deal with the
Marines in 29 Palms and off-loads
them to gangbangers in East LA

Lowell’s eyes dart back and forth between these two

DEPUTY CHIEF LOWELL

I’m going to have to sit you down
with Commissioner Waxman

AXEL

He starts to walk off Lowell looks at Goodwin looking
for help but Goodwin just glares at him then turns and
hurries to catch up to Foley

DEPUTY CHIEF LOWELL
(calls out)

AXEL
(yells back over his
shoulder)

And with that he and Goodwin are out the door

INT BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - AXEL’S ROOM

Axel stands at a sink cleaning his wounds Goodwin sits on
the bed

GOODWIN

AXEL
Goodwin I been doing this job for
25 years This job and me
areintertwined One and the
same

GOODWIN
Like a marriage

AXEL

union”

Axel tucks in his shirt straps on his gun He turns to
Goodwin who looks like a junior version of Foley

AXEL (CONTD)
You ready to kick some ass

CUT TO

EXT JOHNNY KAPS’ MANSION - BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT

This enormous house is thumping as

INSIDE KAPS’ HOUSE

-dohnny Kaps is in the middle of hosting a party We get
the feeling this is an every night of the week affair

Gorgeous women mingle with young wanna-bes as a DJ spins
music blares and bartenders pour martinis

Kaps at a table in the middle of it TWIN BABES on either
side of him He’s wearing shades even though he’s indoors
and the sun hasn’t been out for hours

He looks like the cock of the walk a young punk gangster
born and bred in Beverly Hills

EXT JOHNNY KAPS’ MANSION - BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT

Goodwin and Axel roll up in Goodwin’s now smashed Mercedes
There’s a courtyard in the front of the house where a big
group of people are gathered smoking lounging around a fire
pit etc

A girl with a clipboard DAPHNE approaches

DAPHNE
Nice car Can I get your names

AXEL
I’m with Ethan Goodwin here I’m
his plus one

DAPHNE
(scanning)
I don’t

AXEL
Sure you do Goodwin and Jonathan
Kaplan went to high school
together

GOODWIN
Yeah I went to his bar mitzvah

DAPHNE
Jonathan Kaplan Who knew

The girl laughs at the thought when she looks up from her
list Axel and Goodwin have already disappeared into the
crowd

IN THE COURTYARD

Goodwin and Axel blend in as they both scan the scene
Goodwin turns back and watches some SECURITY GUARDS near the
drive Parked inconspicuously near the trees are some LAPD
CRUISERS

GOODWIN
He’s got LAPD running security

In fact they are the same cops who made Goodwin re-park
serving as protection at the party dressed in plainclothes

Goodwin sees Officer Spellman his parking nemesis
AXEL
We’re gonna need a path out Get
rid of these cops

GOODWIN
Gimme two minutes

Axel walks inside

INT KAPS’ MANSION - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

where the party is still hopping everyone looks so damn
young and vapid and pseudo-hip

Axel looks all over until his eyes settle on the prize
Johnny Kaps

He wanders over until he’s right in front of Kaps

AXEL
(shouts over the music)
Yo Where are your parents at I
need to speak with ‘em

Kaps looks at Axel he can’t believe this guy

JOHNNY KAPS
This is MY house

AXEL
Oh okay Well can you turn the
music down

JOHNNY KAPS
What

AXEL
Can you turn the music down I’m
your neighbor right behind you
there and this party’s a little
too loud

Axel waits

JOHNNY KAPS
(in disbelief)
You’re my neighbor

AXEL
That’s right Moved in with my
mom

Johnny just shrugs and signals to one of his BOYS to take
care of business

Before the guy gets even close to him BAM Axel launches
with a headbutt sending the guy straight down taking his
gun off him as he falls

THE MUSIC STOPS
like a flash there are three HOODS with guns at Axel

JOHNNY KAPS
Get rid of this motherfucker

AXEL
You sure about that

Everything slows down for a second

and Johnny looks down and sees that Axel has a gun pointed
right at his balls

AXEL (CONTD)
I get twitchy pretty easily
Someone shoots me my finger’s
liable to jerk like a catfish on a
line How about your boys back
the fuck off
Everyone goes wide eyed and nobody breathes

CUT TO

OUTSIDE

Goodwin comes down the steps where the off-duty cops all mill
around smoking cigarettes

OFFICER SPELLMAN
Can I help you

GOODWIN
You can’t park here

OFFICER SPELLMAN
Who the fuck do you think you are

Goodwin flashes his police badge

GOODWIN
We’‘re in Beverly Hills now bitch
Move the fucking car
Pissed off the cops slowly move towards their cars

BACK TO

INSIDE JOHNNY KAPS LIVING ROOM
Axel starts moving Kaps toward the door

AXEL
Walk

JOHNNY KAPS
Fuck that I’m not going
anywhere

BAM BAM BAM Axel shoot three times

That’s it the entire PARTY SPRINTS FOR THE DOOR
SCREAMING

Kaps looks down three holes in his wood floor

AXEL
(to Johnny)
Where’s your garage

CUT TO

EXT FRONT OF JOHNNY KAPS’S HOUSE - NIGHT
PEOPLE barrel out of the house SCREAMING THEIR LUNGS OUT

Spellman and the other cops turn around to take in the
madness They realize something is up and race back to the
house

Goodwin darts toward the house just in time to see Axel
rolling out of the side garage in a CONVERTIBLE ROLLS ROYCE
with Johnny Kaps half out the passenger side window
handcuffed to the outside door handle

He races over there and dives in the back of the car and
Axel rips up the road

All the LAPD cops can do is watch as the crowd from the party
starts pulling their cars out on to the street blocking them
from being able to follow

The CAMERA FINDS SPELLMAN who watches in disbelief
pissed

IN THE CAR

Axel’s driving while Goodwin’s in the back and Kaps is
hanging half out the window

AXEL
(to Goodwin)
You should see this fucker’s
garage More cars than Shaq

daddy

GOODWIN
Shaq hasn’t lived here for a while
Axel

JOHNNY KAPS
Where you taking me man

AXEL
Shut up

With that he steers into a parked RANGE ROVER scraping it
and almost ripping off Johnny’s arms

JOHNNY KAPS
Hey Not cool

AXEL
Really

He does it again this time into a parked MERCEDES SUV

JOHNNY KAPS
Fuck

CUT TO

INT BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - COURTYARD - NIGHT

Axel and Goodwin scramble toward Axel’s bungalow holding the
cuffed Johnny Kaps

From across the hotel Z spots them and his eyes narrow

INT AXEL’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT
Kaps is cuffed to a chair sneering at Axel

JOHNNY KAPS
You have no idea who you’re dealing
with

AXEL
Here’s what you need to know
Johnny You might be into guns
drugs hookers smut gambling and
all the other shit they don’t show

you bailed out and on a plane to
Switzerland before you spend a
night in jail Again I don’t give
a fuck What I do give a fuck
about is that you threw my friend
Rosewood out of a twentieth story
window

A light comes on in Kaps eyes

JOHNNY KAPS
I don’t know where you got your
information

Axel nods

AXEL
Johnny Johnny all of that
doesn’t matter It really doesn’t
What does matter is that in high
school Jonathan Kaplan you pissed
off one kid you shouldn’t have

JOHNNY KAPS

AXEL
Look at me I’m aman on fire but
my partner here he’s a goddamn

volcano

Axel looks at Goodwin like “take over man here’s your
shot”

GOODWIN

JOHNNY KAPS

GOODWIN
You’re goddamn right it was me

AXEL
Whoa wait

GOODWIN
No take it one thing I’ve
learned as a cop is you can make
your problems go away by burying
the motherfuckers in Griffith
Park

with his face all busted up

Goodwin backs away and points his gun starts to squeeze the

trigger

GOODWIN (CONTD)

Look in my eyes Jonathan you

end yours I’m going to kill
you and I’m going to get away
with it two dirty cops can get
away with anything

JOHNNY KAPS
Wait a minute Wait
(to Axel)
You can’t let him do this

gets right in Johnny Kaps face so
Goodwin looks psychotic

But Axel just points at his cell phone like he’s making a
call and can’t hear him

JOHNNY KAPS (CONTD)
Wait Listen to me You think I
did your friend I’m telling you
the truth I swear I had no
idea what Babcock was going to do
He told me he’d make the
investigation go away

GOODWIN
I don’t believe you

JOHNNY KAPS
He said he was going to make
ityou know”fly away” I
swear

Those are the magic words
Goodwin looks at Axel

GOODWIN
You got it

Axel flips the cell over shows that it also takes video
He tosses it to Goodwin who looks at the screen and
smiles

ON THE SCREEN

Kaps confessing “I had no idea what Babcock was going to
do”

Axel smiles

GOODWIN
Now we go to the station

AXEL
Phone it in
BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL ENTRANCE - VALET - NIGHT

Right then LAPD patrol cars and undercover sedans pour in
from both sides of the driveway led by Babcock

The CAMERA FINDS Mr BENJAMIN and ELLIOT checking out the
activity worried Z pops out of the lobby to greet the
approaching officers

Z
Thanks for coming officers he’s
in Bungalow 9

More and more cops keep showing up Z is surprised by the
severity of the response

Z (CONTD)
Oh my

Twenty yards away Elliot looks worried Mr Benjamin nods
at him

IN THE COURTYARD

Goodwin steps out of the bungalow to get a signal he
punches in the number for the BHPD

DISPATCHER
(on the phone)
Beverly Hills Police Department

GOODWIN
Ummm this is officer Goodwin

GOODWIN (CONTD)
Hey Michelle it’s me

Johnny Kaps
Some activity UP NEAR THE HOTEL LOBBY catches his eye

GOODWIN (CONTD)
Oh fuck

He hangs up quickly and

IN THE BUNGALOW

steps back in

GOODWIN
We gotta move Now

Axel doesn’t have to be told twice the two of them bounce
out of there leaving Kaps behind

IN THE COURTYARD
They spot the swarming police coming from the lobby

Axel realizes they can’t go that way They head around
toward the side

just as Babcock and his men reach Axel’s bungalow

IN THE BUNGALOW

Babcock throws open the door to find Johnny sitting there
still tied up

JOHNNY KAPS
(pissed)
Get me out of here

BABCOCK
Where’s Foley

JOHNNY KAPS
They took off

Babcock moves in on him menacingly

BABCOCK
What’d you tell him

JOHNNY KAPS
What’d’you mean ‘what’d I tell
him’ You’re the one whos
supposed to be running security and
youve got your thumb up your

Babcock suddenly SLAPS HIM VIOLENTLY knocking his face
sideways then puts a gun under his chin

BABCOCK
(menacing)

Listen son You want to play

Tony Montana let all your Beverly
Hills rich fag friends think you’re

(MORE )

BABCOCK (CONTD)
But you talk to me like I’m one of

of your skull and roll you down
Mulholland Believe that

Kaps swallows hard practically crying

JOHNNY KAPS
Okay

BABCOCK
I took care of East LA Jonathan
You’re the mouthpiece the
billboard but I’m the reason we’re
in business The second you start
to think otherwise is the second I
find a new mouthpiece

Johnny nods fighting off the waterworks

BABCOCK (CONTD)
Now what’d you tell him

Johnny Kaps can’t keep the tears in now
JOHNNY KAPS
They got me on video I told him
that you

BAM Babcock shoots Johnny from under the chin he flops
back in the chair

Just then Spellman and Geadelmann race in eyes wide when
they see the dead body

BABCOCK
We gotta get that fucking video

CUT TO

EXT BEVERLY HILLS STREET - SAME

A group of LAPD CRUISERS races past the BEVERLY HILLS SIGN
coming in to town The cavalry is coming

THE COURTYARD

Axel and Goodwin are cutting between bungalows heading for
the back

A couple of LAPD COPS including OFFICER TALBOTT spot
them

OFFICER TALBOTT
There

They OPEN FIRE

and a FULL ON SHOOT OUT begins in the courtyard of the
Beverly Hills Hotel

Bullets rip up the lawn outside the Bungalows as Axel
returns fire and he and Goodwin scamper from shelter to
shelter trying to stay out of the line of fire

Cops are swarming in from every direction And Babcock has
joined the hunt

GOODWIN
This way Axel

He sees an opening where the courtyard opens up to an
employee parking lot

BAM BAM Axel pops off a few more shots and the two of
them scramble for
THE BACK OF THE BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL

-where they fly out the door just as Elliot whips around
with that limo

They pile in and Elliot guns it out of there

INSIDE THE LIMO

ELLIOT THE CHAUFFEUR
This is getting to be old hat

AXEL
Did you get through to BHPD

GOODWIN
I spoke to Michelle

AXEL
Punch it Elliot Beverly Hills
Police station

ON THE ROAD

The limo roars out on to the street just as twin LAPD
CRUISERS whip right on its ass

Another CRUISER cuts off the limo so Elliot has to spin the
wheel and head UP the hill

IN THE LIMO

Axel rolls down his passenger window but it only goes down
about half-way He pulls out his Glock and smashes the
window out the rest of the way and then starts to crawl out
ON THE ROAD

The DRIVERS of the cruisers spot Axel coming out of the back
seat

One of the police sedans lurches forward the driver’s
going to try to knock Axel off the side of the limo

He ducks back inside right as the cruiser tries to smash
him
ON THE ROAD

Elliot works the wheel trying to keep the limo from plowing
into oncoming traffic

WHAM

ELLIOT THE CHAUFFEUR
AAWWWWWW

His door dented in breaking Elliot’s leg The car starts to
lose speed
IN THE BACK OF THE LIMO

GOODWIN
What is it

ELLIOT THE CHAUFFEUR
I broke my leg

He’s starting to pass out

Axel pops up through the Moonroof and begins to fire

AXEL
Goodwin Drive

Goodwin swallows hard and pulls Elliot aside and climbs
through the partition sliding behind the wheel

He narrows his eyes slams on the gas and

ON THE ROAD

He jerks the wheel steering into the cruiser that’s
alongside him

Axel fires at the trailing vehicle double-fisting his
Glocks and firing in two directions

BAM BAM BAM BAM

All while Goodwin is keeping them steady on a two-lane
blacktop

AXEL
Shit partner You got skills

The limo makes a hard left looking for a way back DOWN the
hill

BEHIND THEM

A barrage of bullets rips up the cruiser’s grill slicing
through it into the fuel line and then

BOOM The trailing cruiser flips up in the air the
explosion happening in the rear of the car so that the back
half flips over the front half and the car lands on its top
sliding to a stop like a gutted lion

Axel just narrows his eyes and turns his attention to the
other car
NEXT TO THEM

The other cruiser is relentless and the two cars keep coming
together breaking off and then coming together again

One of Axel’s guns runs out of bullets until it just click
click clicks

He unloads the clip and racks in another like an expert

NEXT TO THEM

The limo is no match for the power of the LAPD police
cruiser

WHAM The limo takes a shot WHAM And another

UP AHEAD

The road is narrowing as it heads back down toward the flats
Off to the right is nothing but a drop down the hill

Just then a NANNY holding a BABY steps out from a
driveway Goodwin sees it

GOODWIN
You gotta be fucking kidding

--and at the last second steers out of the way avoiding
the fate of his driving test

But no time to celebrate because the cruiser knocks the limo

on to the shoulder and pins it there

Goodwin practically has two tires hanging over the hill as he
tries to force the cab on the road

ON THE ROAD TOWARD THE BEND THAT LEADS TO THE FLATS
The limo keeps fighting the cruiser trying to make it off

the shoulder and away from the drop but every time the
cruiser backs off it just rams the limo again from the side

The bend is fast approaching and where Goodwin is he’s gonna
flip down the hill when they get to the turn

The cruiser moves off a little so it can ram the cab one
final time

and then Goodwin suddenly slams on the brakes

--and the police cruiser lurches past it intending to ram
it but only getting air as the two cars switch places

Goodwin throws the limo back into drive -- it never really
stopped anyway -- and now having the advantage

-he RAMS the LAPD cruiser just as he makes the turn to the

bend

-and the cruiser flips off the curb where it just catches
the edge of the shoulder

--and then plummets down the hill into the foliage

IN THE BACK OF THE LIMO
AXEL
Hahah You did it Goodwin
IN THE FLATS

The limo is about to turn into the Beverly Hills Police
Station

But right then

An LAPD SWAT van driven by Babcock swoops in and cuts them
off

The Limo swerves back onto Santa Monica Boulevard with the
van in pursuit The limo takes a hard turn onto the most
glamorous street in the world Rodeo Drive

The door to the van opens and we see Officer Spellman holding
a goddamn ROCKET LAUNCHER

FOOSH Before Goodwin can even react the rocket propelled
grenade hits the front of the limo just as it was turning on
to Santa Monica and

WHAMMM It knocks it on its side sending it sliding like
shrapnel down

RODEO DRIVE

where it comes to a rest toward the north end of the
street and lies there like a wounded elephant

Slowly Axel and Goodwin emerge from the windows looking
as bad as we’ve ever seen them Beat up shook up knocked
sideways they look like veterans from D-Day Axel examines
his bleeding hand

Unfortunately things get worse as ten LAPD CRUISERS pull up
from the South End of the street led by Babcock in that van
They’re like hunters on the blood trail of their prey

Axel looks over and lowers his eyesfuck he didn’t want
it to end like this

They sit in silence breathing heavily

GOODWIN
You really think Michelle and I
could’ve worked out or were you
just saying that

AXEL
She has nothing but love for you
(beat)
I’m sorry for bringing you into
this

GOODWIN
Fuck you It felt good to be a
cop

Axel puts his guns down tears a strip from his shirt wraps
his bleeding hand then tests his grip on the gun

GOODWIN (CONT’D)
Can you shoot

AXEL
Does Howdy Doody have wooden balls

Goodwin laughs

GOODWIN
I think he does

Goodwin sees the mass of LAPD cops surrounding them They
are outmanned worse than Texans at the Alamo

GOODWIN (CONTD)
Is anyone gonna know what we did
here today

AXEL
Doesn’t matter We’re doing this
for Billy They die before we die

Just then the LAPD unloads on the Limo Axel and Goodwin
scan the street The storefronts are being blasted to bits
along with any high-end cars still on the street at this
hour

The LAPD firepower is more military in nature and the
rockets being fired from Babcock’s van are doing some serious
damage

While valiant Axel and Goodwin just don’t have the
firepower

AXEL (CONTD)
We’ve got to take out that van

Axel looks around The street is a war zone

»except for one place The Rodeo Collection The most
expensive shopping center in the world

AXEL (CONTD)
The Collection Let’s go for the
underground parking lot

They burst out from behind the car weaving their way through
the wrecked cars and disappear into an

UNDERGROUND GARAGE

--where they race down the ramp to the VALET AREA Even
down here everything is first class couches near the
valet a coffee shop and a flower stand

Goodwin leads them through the lot to an unworking escalator

AXEL
What’s upstairs

GOODWIN
More shops It’s open air

AXEL
Go

Goodwin nods and takes off up the escalator Axel following
to

THE SECOND FLOOR

-which is open air Axel and Goodwin keep moving south
through the building until they’ve gone as far as they can
where the walkway ends at the door of “Beverly Hills Plastic

Surgery”

BAM BAM

Axel shoots the door open the ALARM now blaring and mixing
with the sounds of the battle going on the street

ON RODEO DRIVE

Babcock motions for Spellman and Crites to join him They
both have RPGs

BABCOCK
They’re trying to take the high
ground

They move quickly toward a fire escape between two of the
buildings

IN THE SURGERY CENTER

Goodwin moves through the DARK OFFICE to a back room with a
view over Rodeo Drive In the room he bumps into a FEMALE
MANNEQUIN which scares the shit out of him

GOODWIN
Shit

He realizes he’s in a room full of FEMALE TORSOS all
topless all different shapes and sizes

Axel sees this gets to the window which has the perfect high-
ground over the van With a heave he tosses a torso through
the window and levels his gun

ON THE ROOF

Babcock Crites and Spellman are loaded for bear with
military hardware and moving across the roof

The three men set up on the edge quickly unfolding their
launchers

BABCOCK
We take out Foley get the tape and
this all goes away

And RIGHT THEN
--rolling out from the SOUTH END OF THE STREET are the

entire force of the Beverly Hills Police Department led by
Deputy Chief Lowell and Michelle

They’re like ants coming out of a stepped-on anthill
swarming the street outnumbering the LAPD by 3 to l

ON THE ROOF

Axel and Goodwin see the BHPD arriving

AXEL
Well what do we got here
GOODWIN
Holy shit You know what this is
like
AXEL
What
GOODWIN

It’s like on the World Series of
Poker when it gets to that point
where the last two guys push all of
their chips into the middle of the
table and they’re standing up
behind their chairs pacing like
caged animals just waiting for the
last card to be dealt and all the
tension and all the money and
everything is waiting on that one
final flipthat’s what it’s like

Axel turns his head to measure Goodwin Goodwin is wired
excited on edgeand loving it Axel looks on proudly
Goodwin catches his look

GOODWIN (CONTD)

Why are you looking at me like I
just won the first grade spelling
bee

AXEL
Because you’re exactly what I
thought you were

GOODWIN
What the fuck does that mean

AXEL
You like making a difference I’ve
seen it Look at you now
Rosewood would be proud

ON RODEO
Lowell’s got a bullhorn

DEPUTY CHIEF LOWELL
(through the bullhorn)
Detective Babcock Men in the
Eastern Division You are under
arrest Drop your weapons Now

A strange silence overtakes Rodeo Drive Babcock stands
holds his hand to his mouth like a megaphone

BABCOCK
(yelling)
You put your guns down We are in
pursuit of a murder suspect We
will not stand down until we have
Axel Foley in custody

DEPUTY CHIEF LOWELL
You’re in Beverly Hills You have
no jurisdiction here Stand down

For a moment we think they might

On the street there is confusion amongst the LAPD A few of
LAPD officers lower their weapons when

SPELLMAN
Fuck that

WHOOSH Spellman unleashes a rocket down on to the street
where some of the Beverly Hills cops are blown away

BAM Crites takes a shot to the head and falls at Babcock’s
feet

Babcock immediately takes cover behind a bank of AIR
CONDITIONERS firing indiscriminately with their automatic MP-
5’s There are about 20 6-foot tall air conditioners all
bunched together here creating a maze of passages

ON RODEO DRIVE
Michelle is creeping up the street trying to get a shot at
the LA cops She makes it to a trash can but it doesn’t

provide much cover

The cop near the van with the rocket launcher sees her and
she’s a sitting duck where she is He levels his launcher

IN THE SURGERY CENTER
Goodwin sees Michelle is dead to rites and let’s loose
BAM BAM BAM

He kills the guy who was about to shoot Michelle The guy
falls and the rocket fires into Bijan’s ever-present yellow

Rolls Royce

Michelle looks up and sees that Goodwin saved her He points
at the van

She spins and starts emptying her gun on the Van’s grill
it catches on fire and then

BOOM The van goes up in a fireball

The explosion has decimated a good part of the LAPD on the
south end of the street

THE NORTH END OF THE STREET

Deputy Chief Lowell turns to his men and women

DEPUTY CHIEF LOWELL
Move in

They do and BHPD does themselves proud moving briskly and
professionally toward the burning van

ON THE ROOF
Babcock gets a glimpse of Foley standing behind one
BABCOCK
(calls out)

Foley Give me the video and we’1ll
work something out

AXEL
Fuck you Babcock I’m taking you
in

BABCOCK

That’s not the way it works here
You remember Rampart

Axel reloads

BABCOCK (CONTD)
I mean what cop fuck wants to pull
his pud on a hamburger and french
fries government salary when he
could be eating bone-in rib eyes in
Beverly Hills

Axel waits

AXEL
I happen to like a good burger and
fries

BABCOCK

This started with me and Kaplan
but there’s room for more We own
both sides of the fence

Axel checks his gun EMPTY

BABCOCK (CONTD)
This thing was gonna play out till
we were all fat and happy on a
beach sipping Sunny Delight But
your dipshit friend Billy Rosewood
had a misguided sense of integrity

Babcock nods for Spellman to head around the air conditioners
to get the drop on Foley

BABCOCK (CONTD)
I gave him a minute to get his mind
right maybe join us

AXEL
Wasn’t a chance of that

BABCOCK
That’s right Because Billy was a
lifetime sucker

Spellman keeps moving gets to the spot where Axel was hiding
but he’s not there

AXEL
A lifetime sucker That the best
you could come up with

Babcock looks into the darkness was that a moving shadow

He fires a burst from his automatic weapon destroying one of
the air conditioners

A low moan emits from somewhere in the darkness

BABCOCK
Didn’t hurt you did I Foley
(beat)
Foley

Babcock steps out from his hiding spot exposing himself
somewhat

WHAM

Foley slams into him tackling him toward the edge of the
building ramming Babcock’s back into the LOW RAIL separating
them from Rodeo Drive below

WALLOP WALLOP They’re going toe to toe here but Axel’s
fighting like a man possessed running on the greatest of
boosters revenge

WHAM WHAM This is a street fight Axel’s putting
everything he’s got in it Finally he throws a devastating
HAYMAKER that sends Babcock back into the low rail

Babcock just smiles a bloody smile

BABCOCK (CONTD)
You’re a dumb fuck just like
Rosewood

In a blaze he brings up his gun but Axel is faster
bending his arm up and just when we think this is a fight
over who is going to get the gun up

Axel gets low and charges like a linebacker at Babcock
Axel grabs Babcock’s legs lifts the much bigger man off the
ground and flips him over the edge

And the SHOT RESEMBLES THE SHOT OF ROSEWOOD FALLING

until SPLAT No more Babcock Axel looks down from the
rooftop

AXEL
Someone read him his rights

Axel has taken Babcock’s MP-5 from him He checks out the
damage below satisfied

Goodwin comes bounding over at the same time that Spellman
jumps out from behind an air conditioner his gun up

Axel turns seeing Goodwin seeing Spellman with his gun
up

AXEL (CONTD)
Goodwin

Axel fires at Spellman at the same time Goodwin does and the
two of them together pummel Spellman with gunfire before he
ever gets a shot off

And then it’s over Spellman falls back onto the black tar
roof dead

Axel and Goodwin both stand there bleeding their guns
smoking Goodwin looks himself over

GOODWIN
I’m alive

AXEL
I’ve never felt better

Then Goodwin sticks his finger in his ear rubbing it
GOODWIN
God DAMN that was loud

Axel and Goodwin emerge from the parking garage battered but

not broken to see the Beverly Hills PD cuffing the
remaining LA cops that are still alive

This street may never look the same Half the cars are on
fire the windows are blown out but it’s finally quiet

Just then what must be 50 LAPD cruisers race to the scene

There’s a moment of tension among Lowell and the Beverly
Hills cops but the first man out of a LAPD car is
Commissioner Waxman

He takes in the mass of destruction

COMMISSIONER WAXMAN
My god

Foley hands over the phone
AXEL

The video on there is proof that
Babcock killed Billy Rosewood

Waxman nods sadly

COMMISSIONER WAXMAN
I’m truly sorry Detective I had
no

AXEL
I’11l let you two sort out the
jurisdiction

Goodwin smiles big The two of them walk toward Michelle
who looks like she’s done ten rounds with Tyson and the
CAMERA PULLS UP taking in the fact that Rodeo Drive looks
like Baghdad after Shock and Awe UP UP UP until slowly
we

DISSOLVE TO

INT DAN TANA’S - NIGHT

Axel and Goodwin are bandaged up now sitting with Michelle
laughing

AXEL

MICHELLE

Goodwin and Axel look at each other

GOODWIN

him

DEPUTY CHIEF LOWELL
