Tracy is slammed against the shower wall She hits the floor
hard with Rebecca on top of her Water pelting them both

Rebecca clamps a hand over Tracys mouth and pins her

the wall The shower curtain covers her from the neck down
Tracy -- wide-eyed and terrified -- stares at Rebecca

REBECCA
So Sara thinks Im weird Let me

influence on her And I think that

if you tell anyone about what

it

Rebecca one hand still on Tracys mouth slides her other
hand beneath the shower curtain Tracys eyes widen further
Rebecca finds what shes looking for gets the grip she
needs and violently jerks her hand out of the curtain

A muffled scream from Tracy Tears stream down her face
Rebecca stands As Tracy sobs quietly on the shower floor

The bloody ring in her hand

at Rebecca as they order their drinks

from Saras face

chokehold
Sara backs Rebecca into the wall trying to loosen the
chokehold She slams her back against the wall And again

grip

rises
Rebecca knees her in her stomach knocking the wind out of
her As Sara gasps for breath

She raises the gun at the helpless Irene
But out of nowhere STEPHEN RUSHING UP FROM BEHIND knocks
her arm The gun fires wildly one bullet

EXT BUILDING LEDGE - NIGHT

Exploding through the window shattering it and startling
Sara who loses her balance and slips off the ledge She
grabs on by her fingertips her face hitting the brick wall

SARA

(CRYING)
Ohgodohgodohgod
The more she screams the more she loses her grip

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Rebecca fires another shot hitting a giant bedroom mirror
shattering its reflection of Rebeccas struggle with
Stephen

Rebecca slams her head into his lip knocking him backward
He keeps hold of her and they hit the floor the gun flying
out of Rebeccas hand

Stephen gets on top He lifts his arm high and balls his

before he puts it right in her face full throttle knocking
slumps

her out cold
He quickly takes the gun and puts it inside his belt as he
races for the window

He sees Sara dangling outside and reaches for her

EXT BUILDING LEDGE - SAME

arms Leaning halfway outside he starts to pull her up
Part of the way up he holds her against his chest and lets
her cry He smiles

STEPHEN
Okay Ive got you Everything is
gonna be okay
He pulls her halfway in the window
But a shadow rises behind him

IRENE

STEPHEN

A loud unpleasant sound THUD Irene screams

Then Stephen stiffens his body straightening in shock
Somethings wrong And now Sara stares in horror as
Blood runs down his face He looks into Saras eyes and
lets go of her

She falls but manages to hook onto the ledge as Stephen
disappears from the window frame Using the brick wall for
leverage she arduously lifts herself up into the window in
time to see

Stephen glassy-eyed backing away from the window He

to the floor revealing
Rebecca Shes a crazed mess hair and eyes wild
on

Rebecca drops the bloody fireplace poker and rushes to the
window She helps Sara in They tumble onto the floor
Sara tosses Rebecca to the side and rushes over to Stephen

SARA

out spins and levels it at Rebecca The gun shakes
violently in her hand
Rebecca stands and walks calmly towards Sara who is still

the floor

REBECCA

Sara pulls the trigger Click Rebecca stares in shock
Click Click Click Click Sara closes her eyes in
frustration She drops the gun
Tears stream down Rebeccas face She cant believe Sara
pulled that trigger But as if flipping a switch
Rebeccas sadness turns to rage She balls her fists her
knuckles white and
CHARGES at Sara full force slamming her against the wall
She tosses her like a ragdoll across the room where
Saras head slams the nightstand knocking the contents of
Rebeccas purse everywhere
Rebecca wipes the tears from her eyes It hurts her to hurt
Sara

REBECCA
Friends help each other They take
care of each other
Sara dazed and weak stares at Rebecca

SARA
Rebecca We were never friends
Thats the last straw Rebecca comes hard murder in her
eyes She grabs Sara around the throat pulls her up from
the floor and slams her against the wall
She starts choking the life out of her Saras face turns
red Redder
shock

Rebeccas

about

But suddenly Rebeccas grip loosens Her eyes stare in

Sara pulls Rebeccas hands off her neck with one hand The
utility knife is in her other hand stuck between

shoulder blades

Rebecca falls to the floor bringing Sara down with her She
wont let go of Sara As she gasps for air she sees
Saras tattoo visible beneath her torn shirt Sara self-
consciously notices her looking at it Rebecca reaches out
and grabs Saras hand

Sara lets go of her hand and removes the necklace from
around Rebeccas neck

Irene is trembling in the bed Too shocked to say anything
