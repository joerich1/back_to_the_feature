as a US infantryman in Vietnam - this he did as a counter to the vision of

PLATOON
FADE IN
A QUOTATION AGAINST A BLACK SCREEN
REJOICE O YOUNG MAN IN THY YOUTH

The sound now of a C-130 air cargo plane roaring over us and we
cut sharply to

EXT AIRSTRIP - BASE CAMP - VIETNAM - DAY

As the C-130 coasts to a stop the hatch rotating down on a hot
dusty lifeless airstrip somewhere in Vietnam Nothing seems to
live or move in the midday sun

TITLES RUN

A DOZEN NEW RECRUITS step off the plane unloading their duffel
bags looking around like only the new can look around their
hair regulation-clipped crisp new green fatigues fitting them
like cardboard

CHRIS TAYLOR is just another one of them - as he turns into a
tight close-up to look at a motorized cart pulling up alongside
Hes about 21 Newmeat His face unburned yet by the sun
is tense bewildered innocent eyes searching for the truth

They fall now on a heap of BODY BAGS in the back of the cart
Two soldiers begin loading them onto the plane Flies - hundreds
of flies - buzz around them the only cue to their contents

GARDNER
(next to Chris Southern accent)
That what I think it is

SOLDIER 1
(a look)
I guess so

An uncomfortable look between them

SARGENT
Okay lets go

As they move out Chris eyes moving with the body bags being
loaded onto the plane Moving over now to a motley HALF DOZEN
VETERANS bypassing them on their way to the plane They look
happy Very happy chatting it up

They pass the new boys - and they shake their heads their eyes
full of an almost mocking pity

VETERANS
Well Ill be dipped in shit - new meat Sorry bout
that boys - sin loi buddy you gonna love the

Nam man for-fucking-ever

Chris looking at them They pass except for the last man who
walks slower than the rest a slight limp His eyes fall on
Chris

eyre frightening eyes starved hollow sunken deep in his
ace black and dangerous The clammy pallor of malaria clings
o him as he looks at Chris through decayed black teeth Then

e sun flares out on him and hes past And Chris looks back
isturbed Its as if the man was not real For a moment there
s if he were a ghost

POdatHhH

Chris walking duffel bag on the shoulder looks up at the
lollipop sun burning a hole through the sky A rushing SOUND
now Of frightening intensity an effect combining the blast of
an airplane with the roar of a lion as we hard cut to

EXT JUNGLE - SOMEWHERE IN VIETNAM - DAY

The sun matches the intensity of the previous shot as we move
down into thick green jungle We hear the sound of MEN coming a
lot of men The thwack of a machete Brush being bulled We
wait They are getting close

The CREDITS continue to run

SUBTITLE reads December 1967 - Bravo Company 25th Infantry
Division - Somewhere near the Cambodian Border

A sweating white face comes into view CHRIS - cutting point
Machete in one hand whacking out a path for the platoon M-16 in
the other he looks like hes on the verge of heat exhaustion
Breathing too hard pacing himself all wrong bumping into
things tripping not quite falling he looks pathetic here in
the naturalness of the jungle An urban transplant slightly
neurotic and getting more so

His rucksack is coming apart as well about 70 badly packed
pounds banging noisily

Behind him BARNES now comes the Platoon Sergeant Then the RTO
his radio man humming lightly Others are behind the column
snaking back deep into the brush

We cut around some FACES of the Platoon - all to be seen later
Young faces hard and dirty after weeks in the field exhausted
yet alert fatigues filthy slept-in torn personalized hair
way past regulation length medals bandanas A jungle army

Boys

Chris glancing down at his raw bleeding blisters Transfers the
machete to his other slightly less blistered hand The kid
cuts on - struggling but trying on his last reserves of
strength smashing almost straight forward through brush not
even bothering to look ahead He smells something looks around
slows his pace eyes working around to the base of a tree

He moves past it

And as he does so the camera from his POV comes around on a dead
decomposing 10-day-old GOOK - eyes starting from its sockets
worms and flies feasting

Chris draws his breath in terrified Barnes suddenly appears
alongside his hard humorless eyes looking annoyed from the gook
to Chris

BARNES
What are you waiting for He aint gonna bite you
Move out

Chris looks at him with pent-up hatred and crashes on
EXT PLATOON PC - DAY - MOVING
At the COMPANY PC CAPTAIN HARRIS on the radio

HARRIS
Bravo Two Six Whats the delay up there move it
out on point Weve got a link up at Phase Line
Whiskey at One Eight Zero Zero over

EXT PLATOON PC - DAY - MOVING -- MORNING

At the PLATOON PC LIEUTENANT WOLFE sweats heavily as he speaks
in his radio He is also new to the field a dark little feisty
guy about 24 very hairy especially in the eyebrows an intense
get-ahead look

LIEUTENANT WOLFE
Two Bravo Two move it out Six says were jamming
‘em up back there Over

Barnes upfront turns to SAL his radio man under his breath

BARNES
Tell that dipshit to get fucked Get that other
freshmeat up here Gardner

As Barnes picks up his pace irritated now at this reprimand from
the CO - coming up on Chris who is soaked now from head to foot
in sweat dizzy feeling sick about to vomit

BARNES (CONTD)
What the hells the matter with you Taylor Youa

sorry ass motherfucker Fall back

He grabs Chriss machete out of his hand and bulls his way into
the foliage tearing it apart setting a new pace

Chris being bypassed by the column their eyes on him He is
swatting at the red ants that are all over his neck

GARDNER another new recruit fat hustling up to replace him

A big and black medic - DOC - comes over gentle eyes and manner
with him is Sergeant ELIAS concerned

DOC
You okay

CHRIS
Ants I got ants on my neck

(shaking them out)

DOC
(helping him)
Yeah black ants are killers you look sick man You
need a little salt

(reaching into his satchel)

Sergeant Elias a handsome graceful dark-haired Indian kid of
23 the squad sergeant is taking items out of Chris pack - air
mattress extra unnecessary clothing extra canteens grenades
gas mask books

ELIAS
(shaking his head amused)
Youre humping way too much troop dont need half
this shit Ill haul it for you but next time you
check it out with me okay

Chris nodding grateful panting

The men passing watching Chris sorry about this trying to
keep up face

BUNNY a young 18 year-old with an angels face is pissing in
the dead gooks face

KING passes glances at him

KING
Youre a sick mother Bunny

Bunny laughing about it

Chris standing there one moment fighting for his breath
suddenly passes out going over with his 70 pound rucksack
hitting the ground with a loud bang

ELIAS
(concerned)
Hold it up

On Chris - his eyes opening He seems all right

CHRIS
(trying to get up)
Im okay Im okay

Chris crumples backwards Elias helps him
EXT COMPANY PERIMETER 1 - DUSK

The COMPANY - about 100 men who seem insignificant amid the size
of the surrounding jungle - is digging into a perimeter of some
100-yard radius A RESUPPLY CHOPPER lifts off in a flurry of
blowing leaves Bare-chested soldiers chop down trees clear
fields of fire set out claymores fill sandbags chow down
Little fires snake up against the greying red horizon

EXT COMPANY PERIMETER 31 - DOCS POSITION - DUSK
We cut close on a pair of grungy feet - the staple of the

infantry - moving up to DOC the Medic bandaging them for FU

Back in the perimeter RODRIGUEZ sets his M-60 in the newly dug
foxhole SAL next to him is shaving in his helmet

EXT COMPANY PERIMETER 1 - KINGS POSITION - DUSK

KING looks like a king A lion of a black man but with a sleepy
gentle face not to be roused is painfully trying to scrawl a
letter home with the pencil held awkwardly mouthing the words
FRANCIS a young baby-faced black with long lashes and soft eyes
peeks over his shoulder shaking his head

FRANCIS
Shit King it aint d-e-r-e man its d-e-a-r and
Sara dont have no two rs in it fool Shame on

King shrugs a sleepy stoned voice

KING
Dont matter she knows what it means an she
dont read too good nohow

EXT COMPANY PERIMETER 1 - COMPANY PC - DUSK

Sgt Elias washes himself attentive to his body slender and
well-muscled and extremely handsome youth Of Indian blood
with long black hair generous smile wide facial bone structure
gypsy eyes and the cleanest white teeth he could be a young
Greek god He is given somewhat to panache a silver wristband
on his arm a bandana of black parachute silk hanging from his
neck his fatigues tightened down at the ankle he pulls his
pants down checking for crotch rot applying talcum powder to
the area his buttocks facing us

LERNER a white kid 19 from Florida stopping to admire the
frontal view

LERNER
Mumm any time sweetheart

ELIAS
Lerner youd choke to death on it

EXT COMPANY PERIMETER 1 - COMPANY PC - DUSK

At the COMPANY COMMAND POST a beehive of activity with its four
radios personnel some Vietnamese scouts milling around

CAPTAIN HARRIS is running down a field map with his THREE
LIEUTENANTS Harris a broad-shouldered fine-looking military
specimen with the requisite Southern accent and football coach
mannerism is directing his remark to 2nd Platoons LTWOLFE who
looks a little nervous
CAPTAIN HARRIS

Sky Six reports a fresh company of NVA moving across
from Cambodia to this blue line

(points to position)
We got a good chance to light em up tonight All
platoons will set squad-size ambushes before full
dark Lt Wolfe

(glances at him)
You bush in this area near that ol Buddhist temple
we passed on the hump in Lt Hawkins you take this
area in the rubber plantation

LIEUTENANT WOLFE
(eager)
No problem sir

EXT PLATOON PERIMETER 1 - CHRIS FOXHOLE - DUSK

Elsewhere Chris scrapes out a foxhole his shirt off bandana
around his head the work hot and heavy

TEX is out there setting the claymore as BIG HAROLD and JUNIOR
start breaking down their Cs

JUNIOR
(a whining high voice)
Hey Big Harold gimme your peaches for the fruitcake
man

BIG HAROLD
(laughs loudly)
Fuck you bitch

JUNIOR
Cmon man didnt I do you right that time I give you
the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit

BIG HAROLD

Tricky bitch reason you gimme dat turkey loaf is
nobody else can eat that shit cept me so dont start
your game playing with me Junior

Theyre both black Junior with huge goggle eyes and a face of
pimples and pockmarks his teeth yellowed and decayed some of
them missing Harold is about twice his size about 250 pounds
a baby huey concentrating real hard on preparing his stove to eat
with

JUNIOR
Youse a pig man I hope Manny get dat laundry gig
for you do

BIG HAROLD
De fool think hes gonna get it but he aint known
for his thinking

JUNIOR
Hes a fool alright but you a bigger fool Hey
whiteboy watcha waiting for - dat hole aint gonna
dig itself
Chris looks up continues working as Junior chuckles

JUNIOR (CONTD)
Hey Taylor you dont know it but I saved your ass
today I killed a shit-eating dog
(laughing)

BIG HAROLD
(getting up)
That reminds me I gotta take a shit

JUNIOR
You gonna wipe your ass dis time

BIG HAROLD
Yeah if you let me have your shirt

CHRIS

(VOICE OVER as he digs)
Somebody once wrote Hell is the impossibility of
Reason Thats what this place feels like I hate
it already and its only been a week Some goddamn
week grandma

(checking his raw blisters)
the hardest thing I think Ive ever done is to go
on point 3 times this week - I dont even know what
Im doing A gook could be standing 3 feet in front
of me and I wouldnt know it Im so tired We get
up at 5 am hump all day camp around 4 or 5 pm
dig foxhole eat then put out an all-night ambush or
a 3-man listening post in the jungle Its scary
cause nobody tells me how to do anything cause Im
new and nobody cares about the new guys they dont
even want to know your name The unwritten rule is a
new guys life isnt worth as much cause he hasnt
put his time in yet - and they say if youre gonna
get killed in the Nam its better to get it in the
first few weeks the logic being you dont suffer
that much I can believe that If youre lucky
you get to stay in the perimeter at night and then
you pull a 3-hour guard shift so maybe you sleep 3-4
hours a night but you dont really sleep I dont
think I can keep this up for a year grandma - I
think Ive made a big mistake coming here

As he speaks we cut around to various shots of the platoon
members on the perimeter - shaving eating cooking playing etc

EXT PLATOON PC - NIGHT

Towards the end of this voice over we cut to Sgt BARNES moving
towards the PLATOON PC A powerful face a quiet angry fixed
stare a thick trimmed moustache that helps conceal a network of
plastic surgery grafts and scars The distortion from the jaw up
the left side of his face to his forehead punctuated by a severe
indentation above the left eye where a bullet once penetrated his
skull

Walking with him is Sgt ONEILL as they join WOLFE Sgts ELIAS
and WARREN at the PLATOON PC where theyre huddled over maps
Warren is a black thin tall paranoid man with untrusting eyes
silent and bitter

BARNES
(to all almost pleased about it)
We got boo-coo movement 3rd Battalion just got hit
15 klicks north of here
(the MEN react with wary silence)

ONEILL
(eager to elaborate)
Yeah they had claymores strung up in the trees blew
a whole fucking platoon to pieces BAAD SHIT

Barnes inflects his next words at Wolfe who is worried

BARNES
Yeah they got two Lieutenants and a Captain

WOLFE
Jesus

Elias quiet Barnes studying the map

WOLFE (CONTD)
(to Barnes)
Who do you want on ambush Sergeant

Barnes doesnt bother acknowledging the question barely glancing
at the Lieutenant to him a necessary evil Everybody knows
whos really in charge of the Platoon Barnes flicks his gaze to
Elias

BARNES
Elias - you take your squad and Ill take Tex and
Francis from your squad
(to Warren)
We move out in two-zero mikes
(concluding)

ELIAS
I thought it was ONeills turn tonight

They all look at each other ONeill spits in the dust a
freckled short red head with a hard worried face a lifer 30
going on 60

ONEILL
Shit Morehouse and Sal are short Fu Shengs going
on RandR you dont want to send their asses out on an
ambush You got the fresh meat Elias

ELIAS
(to Barnes)
They dont know shit Barnes and chances are we gonna
run into something

ONEILL
So what am I going to do Get one of my guys zapped
so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his
beauty fucking sleep
ELIAS
Hey ONeill why dont you cool it you dont have to
be a prick everyday of your life you know

ONEILL
Fuck you Elias

BARNES
You get your men ready Elias

Concluding the debate no further argument Barnes rises The
meetings closed Lt Wolfe hasnt said a word looking as Elias
departs without a word

ONEILL
(watching him)
Fucking guys got 3 years in and he thinks hes
Cochise or something

His resentment directed partly at the way in which Elias carries
himself the natural sense of grace - and the dignity it bestows

CUT TO
EXT PLATOON PERIMETER 1 - SQUAD ASSEMBLY POINT - DUSK

Later On the very edge of the perimeter darkness coming down
fast the men in the ambush patrol rustle into their packs all
of them bitching

Tex carrying the M-60 looks up at the glowering sky

TEX
Shit looks like rain All night too Gonna grow
mushrooms in your bad-ass crotch Junior

JUNIOR
(under his breath)
Goddamn aint no justice round here you break your
ass for de white man gonna get our act together
do some rappin wid de brothers change things

CRAWFORD
Whats ONeill have a nose up the lieutenants ass
already how come we always get ambush

FRANCIS
Politics man politics We always getting fucked
around here

Chris is scared nervous with his last-minute equipment
adjustments his pack obviously overweight for a night mission as

he hauls it up

Gardner the other new boy is jovial in contrast his wallet
extended towards Chris

GARDNER
Hey Chris I show you a picture of Lucy Jean

CHRIS
(not to be bothered)
No

Gardner shows him his girl Shes real dog u-g-l-y and what
makes it worse is Gardners put the standard photo of Raquel
Welch alongside it tits and all But he misses the irony of it

GARDNER
(admiring)
Yeah shes the one all right thats Lucy Jean
Shes a-waiting for me

CHRIS
(nodding)
Yeah shes real pretty youre lucky

Gardner puts it away Elias appears alongside them checking
their packs out takes out Chriss poncho liner and other items
He carries a modified M-16 with a short barrel and a collapsible
stock

ELIAS
(to both boys)
Dont need this or this youre doing okay Just
stick close to Tex do what he does
(calling out to Tex)
Tex you got Junior and Taylor here on your position

Tex is a sour Texas Ranger type chews tobacco spits

TEX
Damn Lias this guns boss Put Taylor someplace
else

Chris feels the words like lashes on him

ELIAS

You got Taylor

(to Gardner)
Gardner you go with me

(to Chris and Gardner)

Case somethin happens to you you get separated or

lost dont yell out okay Sit tight Well get to
you

His eyes Chris watching them A smile in them Elias moves
off a quality to the man that Chris admires A natural sense of
leadership

BARNES
Okay lets move out

As he follows King on point out the perimeter A single file
EXT THE AMBUSH NIGHT (RAIN)

Night is coming down The tone of the jungle sounds has subtly
shifted - mellower more sinuous and certainly scarier

The file stops King an experienced point man listens

Chris - carrying Texs linked ammo - looks around tense Behind
him is Gardner trying to smile starts to whisper something
(Hey Taylor ) when hes abruptly shushed

The file moves on Gardners pack rattling a little too loud A
weird rush of cold wind now rattles the trees and the MONSOON
comes A hard slanting rain sudden tropic

EXT RUINS - JUNGLE - NIGHT (RAIN)

A piece of an old Buddhist temple under a sulky moonlight now in
a state of decay the jungle surging to engulf it

The Men are setting up quickly and relatively quietly in the
ruins - alongside a miniscule trail The rain is coming down
harder than ever

Chris and Tex setting out their claymore mines raveling back
their detonating cords to their position drenched In the far
distance an ILLUMINATION ROUND brightens the sky for a brief
moment Various ad lib curses and directions are lost in the
sound of the rain

EXT AMBUSH - BARNES POSITION - NIGHT (RAIN)

At the Ambush CP Ace whispers into his radio A soft hissing
sound

EXT AMBUSH - CHRISS POSITION - NIGHT (RAIN)
Later Close on Chris being shaken awake

TEX
Taylor youre on

CHRIS

(groggy)
Uh hunh

The rain continuing to pelt them Tex hands him an infrared
scope

TEX
(suspicious)
You sure you know how to work the claymore

CHRIS
(offended)

Sure

Tex curls up as best he can in his poncho to sleep

TEX
Okay dont catch no zzzs on me buddy or Ill
sling your motherfucking ass You hear me
CHRIS

(grits his teeth)
Yeah
(looking at his watch)

Hey Tex - youre ten minutes fast

TEX
Sin Loi
(tough luck closes his teeth)

Chris lets it go scans the jungle and trail with the scope The
POV is greasy and blurred He puts it aside

Suddenly a series of resonant SNORES crack through the jungle
Chris starts then sees its from JUNIOR lying out there
spread-eagled in the rain Chris prods him

CHRIS
Junior
JUNIOR
Unh Unh
CHRIS
Shaddup Youre snoring Shhh

Bending low into his eardrum Junior never wakes rolls over
with a growl Silence

CUT TO
EXT CHRIS POSITION - NIGHT (RAIN)

Later A pool of muddy water has formed in which a pair of
buttocks sit Move up to Chris still on duty looking at his
watch drawn drenched pathetic rainwater coursing down his
face

CHRIS (VO)
(continuing his letter)

» Course Mom and Dad didnt want me to come they
wanted me to be just like them - respectable hard-
working making 200 a week a little house a
family They drove me crazy with their goddamn
world grandma you know Mom I dont want to be a
white boy on Wall Street I dont want my whole life
to be predetermined by them

A large RIPPING SOUND as the wind blows down a big tree branch
onto the jungle floor He starts peering out Nothing He
looks at his watch again

CHRIS (VO) (CONTD)
I guess I have always been sheltered and special
I just want to be anonymous Like everybody else
Do my share for my country Live up to what Grandpa
did in the First War and Dad the Second I know this
is going to be the war of my generation Well here I
am - anonymous all right with guys nobody really
cares about - they come from the end of the line
most of ‘em small towns you never heard of -
Pulaski Tennessee Brandon Mississippi Pork Bend
Utah Wampum Pennsylvania Two years high schools
about it maybe if theyre lucky a job waiting for
em back in a factory but most of ‘em got nothing

theyre poor theyre the unwanted of our society
yet theyre fighting for our society and our freedom
and what we call America theyre the bottom of the
barrel - and they know it maybe thats why they call
themselves grunts cause a grunt can take it can
take anything Theyre the backbone of this country
grandma the best Ive ever seen the heart and soul
- Ive found it finally way down here in the mud -
maybe from down here I can start up again and be
something I can be proud of without having to fake
it maybe I can see something I dont yet see
learn something I dont yet know I miss you I
miss you very much tell Mom I miss her too - Chris

He moves towards Junior shakes him but Junior seems to be out
of this world

CHRIS (CONTD)
Wake up

Junior opens one dead eye

CHRIS (CONTD)
Its your shift man

Junior scowls swears looks around for his rifle in the mud

Chris crawls back to his position curling himself up in his
soaked poncho teeth chattering from the cold rain splattering
over him A long beat He sighs the sigh kicking off the next
image

EXT CHRIS POSITION - NIGHT

Chris jerks awake - very suddenly very frightened THE RAIN HAS
STOPPED The jungle sounds are loud Cicadas night animals
water dripping hypnotically from leaf to leaf And the whirr of
a million mosquitoes out after the rains chewing at Chris face
He looks around startled

Tex is asleep Junior is asleep What happened He looks at
his watch The mosquitoes are eating him alive He buries his
head in his green towel which he wears around his neck but he
cant see A beat He moves again miserable from the bites
Another beat Then suddenly the sounds of the jungle shift -
some of the animals dropping out A different tone A piece of
wood is stepped on a rustle of bush

Chris sees something lifts an edge of the towel to peek out

A shadow of a figure is frozen there in front of him about 15
yards It looks like a man But it doesnt move At all It
listens

Chris his heart in his mouth tries to peer through it Its a
bush It has to be No human being could stand that still His
heartbeats are up The moments take forever But deep down -
somewhere in his psyche - he knows who it is

The figure now shifts ever so slightly - and moves It IS a
human being Oh my God

Chris looks around Tex seems like a mile away Why doesnt
anyone fire He casts a desperate look at his rifle at his
grenades encrusted with mud but in spite of all his training he
is frozen with indecision and fear at the sight of his enemy

The figure seems to whisper something back then turns and comes
down the trail Now a second and third figure appear behind him
- all in helmets and packs All coming right past Chris

position Ten yards Nine

Chris is rigid with terror Stark eyes Pleading with Tex to
wake up but out of reach He is about to have an anxiety
attack his heartbeats so far up he is sure they will hear him

The first figure is now directly in front of Chris on the trail
looking left and right A rattle of his equipment a creak of
leather A smell The mans face now catches the moonlight and
his eyes come around on Chris

Oriental eyes Looking right at him Startled Chris staring
back hypnotized It all happens very fast The figure murmurs
something in Vietnamese A warning He swivels

A flash of muzzle fire A raking cough of automatic fire A
grenade explosion

Chris is hurled to the ground helmet bouncing off scattered
confused jarred All hell breaks loose around him with NOISE
and SHOUTS

Tex kissing the ground is yelling at him

TEX
THE CLAYMORE GET THOSE FUCKERS

Chris not knowing what hes doing is fumbling with the claymore
handles presses them INSERT They wont give He tries again
and again to the squeeze the life out of them Tex is screaming
at him

TEX (CONTD)
THE SAFETY TAKE THE SAFETY OFF YOU

Lunges over and grabs the handle from Chris Clicks the safeties
off and blows them

Three EXPLOSIONS rip out into the night - and one of the ENEMY is
caught in a brief instant looking like an X-ray his body lifted

and swirling in the air then enveloped in swirls of smoke

Chris trying to keep up grabs his M-16 lays out a stream of
fire The sound all around him is deafening

EXT GARDNERS POSITION - NIGHT

Gardner freaking out stands crouched confused tries to run
collapses

EXT ONEILLS POSITION - NIGHT

ONeill throws a grenade wild
EXT CHRIS POSITION - NIGHT
An explosion Chris hits the deck

Tex is now on the M-60 machine gun yelling at Junior who is
cringing on the ground

TEX
Feed me

He lays out red tracer bullets like laser beams then suddenly
reels back whiplashed screaming A grenade explosion rocks
them

TEX (CONTD)
AAAAAGHHH MY ARM MY ARM

His hand and wrist are gone his face in the dirt Junior is
fumbling around trying to stay down and help him at the same
time

JUNIOR
(grabbing Texs gun)
DOC GET UP HERE TEX IS HIT

Chris looking out to his front has no clue whats going on
Except the fire is slacking Relayed shouts of Medic Medic
Other SHOUTS

SHOUTS
HOLD IT UP HOLD IT UP

The firing has ceased A silence punctuated by occasional
shouts and fast moments has enveloped once more the cemetery
Doc crashes through the bush kneels over Tex who continues to
howl in deep pain

TEX
(freaked out)
MY ARM JESUS FUCKING CHRIST

DOC
Easy Tex easy boy

Trying to sound calm but his voice is on the edge examining the
mutilation with a pen flashlight he whips out his morphine ina
big hypodermic
VOICE
(next position)

Doc over here Gardners hit

DOC
Right there

As he slips the morphine into Texs arm

TEX
(muttering at Chris)

» godamn Godamn DUMB FUCKER DUMB FUCKER

Chris watching suddenly feels himself dizzy instinctively runs
his hands over the back of his neck Feels the warm blood there
A moan comes from his lips Junior looks at him

JUNIOR
Oh shit Doc hes hit too

CHRIS
(weakly)
Im hit

Barnes and Big Harold come hustling up

Doc finishes tourniqueting Tex cradles Chris onto the earth
his flashlight probing the wound Tex in background continues to
thrash and moan

Chris waits tensely for the verdict his eyes big with fear on
Doc who takes out his morphine

JUNIOR
(to Barnes pointing at Chris)
That dumb fuck didnt blow his claymore

Chris hearing this Barnes looks at him

DOC
(to Chris)
» its a scratch nothing to worry about

CHRIS
(suspicious)
Doc tell me the truth dont lie to me

The needle goes in Tex lets out this strange keening moan that
sets everyones teeth on edge

JUNIOR
(to Barnes)
He letem walk right up on us He was sleeping on

CHRIS

(leaving to Harold and Junior)
Self-preservations the first law of nature Gotta

letem go into shock

Texs moans are maddening and scary Barnes suddenly clamps his
hand over Texs mouth shutting him up and from way down deep in

his throat chokes out the words

BARNES
Shut up Shut up - and TAKE IT TAKE THE PAIN

Texs eyes roll wildly uncomprehending Doc and Big Harold
looking at Barnes wondering Tex is suddenly silent shocked
Barnes stands an icy glare goes Junior scrambles over to
Texs side Doc runs off

Big Harold cradles Chris his big black hands like a mother
reassuring him

BIG HAROLD

Chris looking up at him eyes blinking slowly dazed already by
the morphine Hes very scared

CHRIS

EXT GARDNERS POSITION - NIGHT

At one of the positions Doc is working feverishly to knock the

talking numb terrorized yet strangely detached accepting not
protesting or concerned any longer

Most of the ambush has assembled and is watching Chris moving in
to see Doc is mumbling to him low key

DOC
Choppers on the way Gardner hang in there you
gonna be okay

But Gardner seems unconcerned Things are going on in his head -
who knows what And in his eyes there are big tears rolling
Then a morphine smile A sort of goofy Gardner smile maybe
thinking about Lucy Jean who knows Hes dead

BARNES

Barnes registering it just keeps on walking
EXT BASE CAMP - DAY (WEEK LATER)

Chris is driven up in a jeep to his Company PC - marked Bravo
PC on a C-ration box Its midday on a hot lazy afternoon few
people out in the 102 degree sun

Chris Company is on the outskirts of the base camp their
barracks regulation wood canvas and fine mesh screening red
dust everywhere bunkers down on the perimeter reams of barbed
wire and concertina a sand-bagged MESS HALL and CHAPEL 81 mm
mortar pits observation towers recoilless rifles 50-caliber
machine guns

Chris gets out of the jeep stiff-necked a bandage around it
still in some pain The first man he intersects is KING

carrying crates of beer

KING

In Kings mild tone Chris tries to read his standing in the
platoon

CHRIS

EXT THE OUTHOUSE - DAY

A wooden cabin with some half-dozen seats built over half barrels

cut from empty oil drums A guy is in there pulling up his
pants

Chris King and Crawford a California blond with a handsome
honeyed look are sweating heavily as they roll the barrels out
from under the outhouse the smell of human waste strong A hot
midday emptiness nobody around except the flies

KING

CRAWFORD

KING

King has long sleepy eyelids and cats eyes a large pink tongue
and big white-edged cotton pickers nails - a lazy gentle
nature content with the world

CHRIS
Didnt make much sense Wasnt learning anything
(hesitates)
And why should just the poor kids go to the war - and
the college kids get away with it

King and Crawford share a smile

KING
What we got here a crusader

CRAWFORD
Sounds like it

They pause wipe the sweat off King lighting up a half-smoked
joint hitting a few puffs eyes shooting around making sure
hes not spotted passing it to Crawford

KING
Sheeit gotta be rich in the first place to think

fucked by the rich Always have always will

Noticing Chris is having trouble with his neck picking at his
bandage

King and Crawford chuckle go on rolling the cans

KING
Dats what they all say

CUT TO
EXT OUTHOUSE - LATER - DAY

King Crawford and Chris pour kerosene over the cans at a secure
distance from the outhouse

King lights it The cans pop and start crackling A line of
burning barrels Rings of dirty black smoke rise against a soft
blue sky

They watch stoned Chris turns to both of them

CHRIS
» you know that night we got hit I
(ashamed)

KING
Fuck it dont mean nothing no such thing here as a
coward done your best man next time ydo better

CRAWFORD
History man history

Chris surprised at their attitude The joint suddenly hits him
a look in his face eyes looking around different Over at King

CHRIS
(deadpans)

Crawford laughs
KING
(laughs)
Yo getting there Taylor You be cool now and Ill

introduce you ‘round to some of the heads

CHRIS
What are the heads

KING
(laughs walks away with Crawford)

Later

Chris alone breathes deep feeling the full effect

EXT BASE CAMP - NIGHT

A relief against the long harsh hot day We see lights on all
over the camp sounds of music laughter from the barracks

INT UNDERWORLD HUTCH - NIGHT

King leads Chris down to a specially constructed cellar-like
hutch dug deep into the ground on an isolated edge of the
battalion perimeter Ammo casing and canvas are piled over it
and sandbags surround it From the outside very little sound can
be heard as they go down through a trap door made of ammo crates
Past a lookout (Adams) pulling security hitting a joint but
alert King motions to him its cool

Inside is another world Chris looking around amazed Its like
a private cabaret for the heads who are there cooling out
Boxes of food from the States beers whiskey bottles crates
functioning as tables hammocks hanging from poles electric
fans tape decks paraphernalia

The boys are all dressed up in their Saturday night rags The
clothes are clean the headbands the medallions are out
anything distinctive and individualistic On the tape deck
Jefferson Airplanes Go Ask Alice

To Chris it is a new world And RHAH the resident head sitting
there in all his finery puffing a huge burning red bowl ina
three foot long Montagnard pipe seems to be the lord of final
judgment in this smoky underworld

Across his naked chest birds and snakes are tattooed Around his
neck a black skull and white ivory cross side by side On his
knuckles Love and Hate are tattooed In his eyes a dancing
Satanic fire A poor rural Southern white in his grizzled late
20s he could be a Biker King Giving Chris the once-over

RHAH
Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor

KING
(smiling)

This aint Taylor Taylor been shot This man Chris

been resurrected
Chris wondering what hes doing here His eyes roving over
LERNER CRAWFORD MANNY FLASH FRANCIS HOYT TUBBS DOC other
from the Platoon about 9 or 10 of them
Rhah eyes him back hands him the bowl

RHAH
You lame Taylor

CHRIS
What

RHAH
You lame or something

KING

(smiling)
» go ahead on smoke it man

Chris understands takes the bowl Hesitates Then smokes it
The contact fumes are almost enough to knock him out He starts
coughing Theyre all laughing

RHAH
Your shits in the wind troop Baaaaah

Lerner replies his tongue hanging out in parody

LERNER
And Baaaaaaa back on you

RHAH
(looking at Lerner with distaste)
If youre gonna do it man ‘least do it right

Building up to it his eyes shaking with conviction at the whole
insanity of the world he neighs with all the venom he can
muster

RHAH (CONTD)
Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

They all laugh and applaud King smoking from the pipe passing
it back to Chris who takes another hit doesnt cough this time
looking around wondering about these guys

LERNER
I didnt like it

RHAH
Bah youre a child Lerner Rhah dont waste time
on you

They go on ad-libbing with each other teasing Doc whos fairly
straight saying he wants to go to med school in the fall Be

what A gynecologist man What dat Francis suggests Dats a

pussy doctor man - hes gonna be Doctor Feelgood man Theyre
all cracking up finding every joke funny As Chris finishes his
hit on the pipe looks up across the smoke already dazed
surprised to see ELIAS suddenly there - leaning out of his sling
in a far corner of the hooch A Monkey is draped around his neck
with silver bracelets rings a necklace - like a sensual little
Egyptian whore Elias playing with it spaced out in a sleeveless
vest tiger pants Dancing eyes on Chris he swings out the
hammock comes over with the monkey

Meanwhile Manny has broken into a high falsetto snatch of blues
directed at Chris joined by Big Harold and Francis all of them
clicking their hands

MANNY and BIG HAROLD and DOC
Oooh Chris you look like you is high oh yeah he
looks like he is high Ooooh Chris you know you gonna
be that way all night oh yeah I think that you are
Yeah up now and up to par oh yeah

Elias pulls out a Remington 870 shotgun jacks it to the rear

points it at Chris

ELIAS
Put your mouth on that

Chris does so slowly a little worried Elias takes a hit and
blows it down the bore - shotgunning it into Chris lungs
Chris staggers back coughing Everybody laughs hey dude - you
done had your ass blown away etc

Elias smiles his big white-tooth smile

ELIAS (CONTD)
First time

CHRIS
Yeah

ELIAS
Then the worm has definitely turned for you man

Chris puzzled by this expression

ELIAS (CONTD)
(smiles)
Feel good

CHRIS
(a sense of euphoria now)
Yeah No pain in my neck now Feels good

ELIAS
Feelin goods good enough

As he sucks in a huge mass of smoke off the bowl His eyes
performing a funny little hop skip and jump as he holds it his
face turning red

The monkey jabbers and jumps around on his neck worried Elias
then blows the smoke out in its face the monkey hating it

The Group laughs

ELIAS (CONTD)
Hey Crutcher JI hear you got a Dear John from your
gal Told you she wasnt getting nuff from you

Lerner looks up stoned out of his mind wearing a ring in his
ear

LERNER

INT THE BARRACKS - NIGHT

In comparison to the darkness of the hooch a highly lit
atmosphere attracting bugs dusty gear lying around a
disordered hooch loud and finger-snapping COUNTRY WESTERN MUSIC
playing from a tape deck a well-known tune circa 1967

browed Italian kid from Boston

RODRIGUEZ the Mexican-American kid who is on his cot in

Religious objects comprise his few decorations

Wolfe winks at him continues on to the POKER GAME going on in
the center of the barracks the main action BARNES
SgtsONEILL and WARREN the quiet sullen black SANDERSON and
SAL play as ACE the tiny radio kid and MOREHOUSE look on all
of them drinking beer and bourbon chasers from a bottle

WOLFE
(to ONeill)
Hows it going Red
(using his nickname)

ONEILL
Shit cocksuckers got all the cards tonight

WOLFE
(to Barnes)
Looks like youre doing all right Sergeant

Barnes raking in the chips is the big winner a light bead of
sweat on his forehead and a somewhat glassy look to the eye the
only indication he is drunk - his shirt peeled off revealing a
muscular scarred body

BARNES
Yeah and I aint even cheating yet

SANDERSON
(the big blond kid)
Have some Kentucky windage Lieutenant
(passes him the bottle of bourbon)

Wolfe takes a nip

BARNES
Play Lieutenant

WOLFE
Nah I wouldnt want to get raped by you guys

ONEILL
What are you saving up to be Lieutenant - Jewish

Laughs Wolfe forces a smile glad to move on There is a
continual worried rodent air about him an anxiety a desire to

fill the vacuum in his leadership with a false masculinity

WOLFE
Catch you men later Enjoy yourselves

As he goes ONeill shakes his head after him
ONEILL

Sorry ass motherfucker aint he You think he gonna
make it Barnes

Barnes plays a card glances a minute movement of his head

ONEILL (CONTD)
Yeah thats what I figger Some dudes you jes look

Barnes looks - with some irony - at ONeill The Country Western
tune has reached a crescendo whine which now mixes into

INT UNDERWORLD HUTCH - NIGHT

Francis the baby-faced black and Manny green shades covering
his skinny face lead with a high blues falsetto

FRANCIS AND MANNY
(singing)
People say Im the life of the party cause I tella
joke or two Although I may be laughing loud and
hardy Deep inside Im blue

The Hutch looks now like a Turkish bath with minimum visibility
the smoke fumes dense They are all up dancing on their feet -
King Tubbs Big Harold Hoyt Lerner Crawford Flash Doc
Elias - a few light gestures with their hands above shoulder
level passing around the grass pipes while they shuffle fingers
clicking The song - Smokey Robinsons Tracks of My Tears -
accompanies them from a vintage tape deck

ALL
Since youve left me if youve seen me with
another girl seeming like Im having fun although she
may be cute shes just a substitute because youre
the permanent one

King and Big Harold wave Chris into the Circle and he starts
swaying with them feeling as if hes being accepted into a new
family

Rhah watches it all puffing away on his magic dragon pipe the
shadows dancing on the walls

It looks like a Saturday night dance party A yearning for
tenderness for femininity for a moment of peace in this nightmare
life Their eyes closed thinking of dance partners that cant

be here tonight Singing their souls out

ALL (CONTD)
So take a good look at my face Youll see the
smile looks out of place Look a little bit closer
Its easy to trace The tracks of my tears

EXT JUNGLE - NVA BUNKER COMPLEX - DAY

An overwhelming 103 degree heat Chris is once more on point a
little better now but obviously struggling with a thick
unyielding bamboo thicket that forces him forward in a caveman
crouch Napalm jelly is hanging from the trees in great canopies
of spider webs obliterating the sky

CHRIS (VO)
New Years Day 1968 Just another day Staying
alive Theres been a lot of movement neat the
Cambodian border regiments of NVA moving across A
lot of little firefights ambushes we drop a lot of
bombs then we walk through the napalm like ghosts in
a landscape

Chris working his way over twisted broken stumps branches On
the back of his flak jacket hes written If I die bury me
upside down so the whole world can kiss my ass

BARNES
Pssst

The signal for silence Chris freezes Barnes edging up to him

BARNES (CONTD)
(whispers)
Bunker

CHRIS
Where

Doesnt see it Following Barnes imperceptible movement of his
head

The bunker dug into the ground and camouflaged with brush is
staring right at him not more than 20 feet away Chris is a
dead man if

Barnes checking the terrain signals radioman Hoyt
Barnes edging up to the bunker eyes everywhere Chris
following The tension builds They come up to the edge of it

peer in Nothing

Barnes walks around it slips in from back Chris covers him
other guys coming up now making a small perimeter

Chris now starts to see things he didnt see Right in front of
his nose - there is a trench from this bunker to another and
another There is now in his view a complex of bunkers and
thatched hootches and lean-tos all blending into the forest A
ghost city

Elias and others fanning out now careful whispered
conversations in the wind

Chris moves past a rope with freshly washed laundry stretching

between two trees clothes stirring in the wind He looks up as
King points out a tree house then looks down as Lerner whispers
something and points - NVA rucksacks are laid out on the ground
in an orderly platoon-sized pattern

the cathedral dome of the jungle Bird calls

INT NVA TUNNEL - DAY

Elias climbs deeper and deeper into the hole a rope attached to
his waist leading out to the surface his flashlight now coming
around on a shaft-way demarcating a TUNNEL that seems to stretch
for at least 100 yards The light revealing cobwebs all along
it but tall enough for a small man

EXT CHRIS POSITION - DAY

Its quiet weird Chris takes his pants down squats He
thinks he hears something tenses

There is a soft rustling sound now And as he focuses on it he
realizes it is coming from very close to him Something light
and sinuous moving over the leaves He looks down

A bright yellow and orange-ringed krait viper is crawling right
between his two legs It stops senses another life standing
over it

Chris frozen with dread

The snake crawls on pulling its long long 15 foot body behind
it

On Chris eyes dilated slowly regaining his breath looking
around everywhere now

INT NVA TUNNEL - DAY

Elias moving down the tunnel fearless We expect something any
moment to come out and nail him but nothing does He stops His
flashlight revealing a kitchen and an NVA hospital set up A
hammock swings as if someone just deserted it In another
hammock is a dead man Elias advances cautiously

his clothes shredded he stares at Barnes dazed Both his arms
are gone and blood is gushing out like a water fountain He
crumbles - dead or dying

BARNES
Corpsman

He runs over to Sal gets a hold of his face in a vice-like grip
enraged tries to yell some sense into him

BARNES (CONTD)

INT NVA BUNKER - SANDERSON POSITION - DAY
Barnes is still there in the wrecked bunker squatting there
staring as if his mind has disconnected for a moment He reaches
up touches his scars The look on his face suggests he is
deeply wronged by this tragedy that he is taking it very
personally
EXT NVA BUNKER - MAIN POSITION - DAY

Chris watches him from outside the bunker awed

Barnes notices Chris watching him takes a breath stands

BARNES
You gonna sit there and play with yourself Taylor or

CHRIS (VO)
We had to get to the village before dark so we left
Elias with some men to keep looking and to wait for
the engineers But it was King who found him
about 1000 yards downriver not far from the village
- It was the end of the mystery

A moving shot approaching Manny Hes trussed with rope arms
behind his back Throat cut eyes startled open mouth shaped in
a scream of terror

Barnes the other men looking Chris Barnes says it for
everyone The motherfuckers

EXT VILLAGE - TRAIL - DAY
They come up out of the jungle onto the side of a CART TRAIL
where a tiny village overlooks the river The VILLAGE is poor a

series of thatched hutches made of C-ration cardboard and
aluminum beer can sidings faint whiffs of smoke coming from cook

fires Pigs and dogs wander about
An OLD VILLAGER watches them pass from his tillable plot smoking
a cigarette one leg wrapped around his hoe resting no
expression
CHRIS (VO)

the village which had stood for maybe a thousand

years didnt know we were coming that day If they

had they would have run Barnes was at the eye of

our rage - and through him our Captain Ahab - we
would set things right again That day we loved him

A pig loiters along the trail rooting
Bunny coming up on it with a smile

BUNNY
Hey pig pig - come here pig pig

The pig grunts Bunny leveling his shotgun fires point blank
A horrible squeal

Chris directly behind him looks disgusted
EXT VILLAGE - DAY
Tony suddenly points excited calls to Barnes

TONY
There goes one

Their POV - a young VILLAGER fleeing down the slope

Barnes doesnt hesitate nails him with a short volley of well-
placed shots

BARNES
(to Tony)
Check him out
He turns back into the village

EXT VILLAGE - DAY

Troops fanning out over the village some TWO DOZEN VILLAGERS
scattering to collect their children dogs barking

SGTSONEIL AND WARREN
Get em out Get em out

EXT VILLAGE TUNNEL - DAY

In another part of the village Barnes hovers over a hole leading
into some kind of tunnel

BARNES
Get out of there you fuckheads move Move

Fires a warning shot Three VILLAGERS climbing out of the spider

hole arms raised but not showing any emotion Barnes turning
to his radioman Hoyt and Big Harold accompanying

BARNES (CONTD)
(to Harold)
Putem in the pig pen
(to Hoyt)
Theres more down there Gimme your Willy Pete

Hoyt with reluctance in his eyes hands over a specially shaped
grenade

Barnes stands over the hole the grenade in hand
The three VILLAGERS who just came out of the hole yell from the
distance to others still in the tunnel pleading with them to

come out

BARNES (CONTD)
FIRE IN THE HOLE

Barnes throws the phosphorus in A muted EXPLOSION Then
sizzling acidic fumes Frying sounds A hideous scream from
somewhere deep in the hole
Hoyt watching is sickened Barnes businesslike
The Villagers in grief howl and tear at their faces
FU SHENG
(hustling up to Barnes)

Sarge we found some shit
Barnes going with him
EXT VILLAGE - OUTSIDE HUTCH - DAY

The sun is sitting there hot and high in the sky

Chris strangling in heat a demented look on his face staggers
into a hutch with Francis

INT HUTCH - VILLAGE - DAY

Threadbare poor a typical Buddhist shrine in the corner motes
f light crisscross through the poor matting and c-ration sides

fe

Chris edges over pries up a floorboard flips it over scared

Theres a tunnel inside A long dark dangerous hole

CHRIS

FRANCIS

CHRIS

Francis doesnt recognize him in his rage Bunny now coming in
followed by ONeill drawn by the shouting

EXT VILLAGE - WEAPONS CACHE - DAY

Barnes stares down at a WEAPONS CACHE buried cleverly underneath
the rice urns Ace Fu Sheng SgtWarren LtWolfe others are
digging it out Its in white plastic wrappings - a load of AK-
47s rockets grenades claymores carbines flares NVA
uniforms A real find

SGT WARREN
(to Barnes)
and over here theres enough rice to feed a whole
fuckin regiment

Barnes walking with him over to an undercover rice silo being dug
out by Tubbs and Junior Barnes looks it over

BARNES
(to Warren)
bring the honcho over here
(to Tubb and Junior)
Burn it

INT HUTCH - VILLAGE - DAY

An Old Woman and her Son a young man with one leg throw up
their hands climbing out of the hole with stupid confused looks
as Chris shaking with his own sort of confusion and rage cuffs
them hustling them out The Young Man uses a pair of crutches
for his blown-off limb hobbling like a mangy three-legged dog

BUNNY
Hey look at this Ma and Pa Kettle here Look at
them - greasy gook motherfuckers

CHRIS
Get up out of there You see I didnt wanna hurt
you Why didnt you come out when I said so hunh
Why WHY WHY DONT YOU LISTEN WHAT ARE YOU

SMILING AT HUNH FUCKING ASSHOLES

The couple hands raised muttering things in Vietnamese dont
understand a word shaking their heads stupidly and smiling that
impassive Oriental smile which sends Chris into a rage only he
can understand

His finger closes on the trigger of his 16

Francis the baby-faced black looks nervously sensing the
danger Bunny amused drawn in by Chris ONeill watches
passively from the lip of the hutch

The Young Man continues to grin not seeming to realize the
degree of danger hes in which is what Chris wants - a token
sign of acquiescence There is also the added element of showing
off his manhood in front of an audience now

BUNNY
Do em man do ‘em

Chris The trigger He pulls But he cant quite bring himself
to kill The bullets exploding in the dirt at the edges of the
young mans foot

CHRIS
(demonic)
DANCE YOU ONE-LEGGED MOTHERFUCKER DANCE

The Young Man hops up and down in a reflex fear of the sounds of
the bullets as they thud into the dirt Yet his eyes remain
fixed on Chris in wonderment

Chris firing out the magazine seems to expend his bloodlust
He ceases noticing - for the first time - the eyes of the Young
Man They arent stupid - nor fearful - but filled with
resignation and despair - a despair that Chris in disgust of
himself recognizes

Chris lowers the rifle silent

The Young Mans impassive face shines now with tears That sad
young look - as if death itself wouldve been a release Chris
turns his eyes away an awkward sense of shame

FRANCIS
(leaves)
Lets get out of here man

But Bunny takes up the slack moves forward on the young man

BUNNY
(to Chris)
You chickenshit man theyre laughing at you look at
them faces Thats the way a gook laughs

The Young Man nodding affable to Bunny and mumbling ingratiating
words in Vietnamese

BUNNY (CONTD)
Yeah sure you are youre real sorry aint you
Youre just crying out your hearts about Sandy and
Sal and Manny - theyre laughing at us Their family
is out there in the fucking bush blowing us away and
theyre laughing at us

ONEILL
(checking out the hutch)
Forget it will ya lets go

Chris standing there watching sensing something awful is going
to come and unable to do anything about it It comes - suddenly
and without warning Bunny is looking at ONeill the Vietnamese
couple are muttering something In one fluid move Bunny swivels
and with unbelievable savagery clubs the young one-legged man in
the side of the head with the butt of his 16

ONEILL (CONTD)
(stunned)

Hey what are you doing

BUNNY
Fucker

The young man is groaning on the floor of the hutch Bunny
smashes him - again and again

BUNNY (CONTD)
Thats for Sandy And this is for Sal And this is
for fucking Manny This is for me

Chris watches horrified Never in his life has he seen
something so horrifying as this And yet he does nothing He is
part of it

BUNNY (CONTD)
(stepping back examines whats left of the head amazed)
Wow You see his fucking head come apart Look at
that I never seen brains like dat before Jesus
fucking Christ

The Old Lady is shrieking hovering over the body of her son
Bunny studying her

BUNNY (CONTD)
Betcha the old bitch runs the whole show Probably
helped cut Mannys throat Probably cut my balls off
if she could
(to Chris)
Come on man lets do her

She cowers from him Chris steps back horrified As is
ONeill more puzzled than horrified

BUNNY (CONTD)
(hitting her again)
Lets zap all these motherfuckers Lets do the
whole village

He backs out of the hutch scared Evidently Bunny is
temporarily insane But he spots ONeill yells at him

BUNNY (CONTD)
GET BACK HERE YOU FUCKING COWARD ONEILL THIS IS
FOR SANDY THIS IS FOR SANDY MAN AND SAL AND
MANNY

As he clubs her to death

On Chris face blood and brain tissue flying up into it

EXT CENTRAL AREA - VILLAGE - DAY

A tiny knot of men are ringed around Barnes who is questioning a
sturdy-looking man who is the VILLAGE CHIEF He has been
stripped of his shirt scars all over his body scared He has

his ID papers out trembling showing them to Lerner who speaks
some pidgin Vietnamese

BARNES
Whered he get these wounds

Lerner translates the man talking back

LERNER
He says he was hit in a bombing raid

TONY
Hes a dink fosure

BARNES
Ask him what the weapons are doing here

LERNER
He says they had no choice The NVA killed the old
honcho when he said no He says the rice is theirs

BARNES
Bullshit who the hell was the dink we just nailed
on the riverbank

Chris and ONeill come up watch Others coming from different
places - sensing the narrowing drama But half the platoon is
still at work in the village We hear shouts grenade
explosions occasionally gunfire

LERNER
He says he doesnt know NVA havent been around
in a couple of months Maybe it was a scout or

The men around Barnes grumble

BARNES
Yeah sure it was What about all that fucking rice
and the weapons who they for
(looking at the Village Chief)
Cocksucker knows what Im saying dont you Pop
(a blank look)

ACE
Youre goddamn right he does

Lerner translating The Village Chiefs WIFE is now on the
scene a middle-aged woman with angry features yelling at Lerner
trying to answer for her husband a high-pitched barrage of
indignant words directed mostly at Barnes and interspersed with
the spitting of her betel nuts on the ground

The Village Chief trying to talk her down But things are
definitely getting out of control And the heat from the sun is
only aggravating the situation pounding down on the actors in
the drama their fatigues soaked in sweat and anger

LERNER
(finally)
He swears he doesnt know anything He hates the NVA
but they come when they want and

JUNIOR
Hes lying through his teeth

TONY
Waste the fucker then see who talks

BARNES
Whats the bitch saying

LERNER
(overwhelmed)
Shes going on I dont know - why are we shooting
the pigs theyre farmers they got to make a

living all that crap

The Woman is still ranting when Barnes turns to her quite
casually levels his M-16 and puts a bullet in her head She
goes down as if pole-axed

A stunned pause The Chief looking at his wife The Villagers
in background reacting

Wolfe looking Chris looking shocked Doc possibly the
straightest of them all very uncomfortable They are all
shocked in some way but do nothing against the power of Barnes
Barnes walks over to the pig pen with the other Villagers very
casually confronts them

BARNES
(to Lerner)
Tell him he talks or Im gonna waste more of ‘em

Lerner shaken up muttering to the Village Chief who is in shock
kneeling next to the body of his wife muttering in a high whine
of pain

BARNES (CONTD)
Go ahead Lerner ask him

A group of Villagers huddle to one side
Lerner shaken is yelling at all of them demanding an answer
LERNER
They dont know Sarge they dont know
(half believes it)
Barnes turns his attention on the other villagers his intentions
apparent Everybody feels them Theyre next Barnes is
unperturbed very much in command of the situation no rage no

emotions expressed

Chris has never seen such a thing in his life - but cant react
Cant stop it just watches it like hes not quite there

The same goes for Lieutenant Wolfe for all of them The very
outrageousness of Barns killing seems to quell all protest

ACE
(sensing the impending massacre)

Hey Sarge can we get in on this

Tony advances the hairy Italian kid from Boston

TONY
Lets go all the way lets go for it Lets do the
whole fucking village Come on Sarge
Chris eyes Rodriguez next to him is neutral but willing

Francis is hesitant

Fu Sheng and Junior are ready to go for it LtWolfe is
powerless frozen

SgtWarren stepping up The massacre is just about to break
The Villagers know it kneel in prayer mutter

Barnes suddenly grabs and drags a young 19 year-old Woman the
Village Chiefs daughter across the pen throws her down on her

knees in front of the stunned Village Chief Shes screaming

BARNES
This his daughter right

Lerner nods Barnes pulls his 45 puts it alongside her head
BARNES (CONTD)
(to Village Chief)

You lie You Vee Cee I caca ado Vee Cee

He chambers the 45 the Woman begging Barnes for her life
cradling his knees He sticks the gun down above her skull

Chris wanting to cry out to do something - but cant

A FIGURE suddenly flares out in the sun advancing on them It
is Elias

ELIAS
BARNES

Barnes looks around They all look around
Elias walks right up to him followed by his men - King Rhah
Crawford others from the rear party He looks around The

corpse of the Wife the Young Daughter sobbing

ELIAS (CONTD)
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING

BARNES
(pissed)

Stay out of this Elias This aint your show

ELIAS
YOU AINT A FIRING SQUAD YOU PIECE OF SHIT

The stock of his rifle swings up fast and hard smacking Barnes
full in the face breaking two teeth

Barnes staggers back hurt bleeding Elias is on him like a
leopard Battering him with his fists

They struggle in the dust two titans their faces equally
consumed with rage clawing spitting punching kicking
pounding each others skulls in the dirt A dust storm swirls
around them the men closing around like excited apes at a
blood-feast

Most of the men seem to be pulling for Barnes - Chris just
watching neutral

LIEUTENANT WOLFE
BREAK IT UP ELIAS BARNES

But they roll on smashing each others faces in Both quick
fast agile mean fighters SgtsONeill and Warren drag them
apart

BARNES
Youre dead youre fucking dead Elias

ELIAS

WOLFE

They compose themselves the Villagers looking on grieving over
their loss

WOLFE (CONTD)
Alright Six says torch this place Blow the weapons

ELIAS
(to Wolfe)

ELIAS
(spins him around)
You know what Im talking about

WOLFE
No I dont I dont know what the fuck youre

(goes)

Who wants to be reminded A silence of shame The Men moving
away Warren Ace Tony Rodriguez Barnes looking back once a

cold glare

The Village Chief is a broken-looking man huddled over his
wifes body

Elias stands there frustrated

Chris glances at him moves out

EXT SMALL VILLAGE - DAY

A zippo cigarette lighter with the engraved initials From Mai
lin to my Bunny Boy It sparks a thick flare as Bunny lights
the dry straw on the roof of the Hutch where he killed the Old

Woman and Young Boy

Their legs sticking out at the threshold The hooch burning
fast aided by the strong sun

Bunny watches with awe

Chris wanders through this wreckage in the sun like a dazed
visitor from another planet not believing it He sees
something goes towards it - knows what it is

EXT VILLAGE - EDGE OF WOODLINE - DAY

Hidden at the edge of the woodline King hands back a bowl of
grass to Rhah the chief head Theyre puffing away

KING

Sheeit beats burning hutches anyway

They meditatively look out at the Village - burning hutches
sending up spirals of smoke Shouts Shots Chaos

RHAH
Yeah - stoneds the way to be

EXT VILLAGE - DITCH - DAY

In a ditch running alongside the Village partially concealed by
foliage and anthills Tony Morehouse and the ubiquitous Bunny
have a 12-YEAR-OLD VIETNAMESE GIRL pinned to the ground gagged
and squirming naked They are fucking her to death Junior
looks on both curious and disgusted but doesnt take part

TONY
Take her up the ass

As they roll her over like excited dogs in heat
Chris coming up sees their heads dipping up and down on the
other side of the anthill knows what theyre doing He makes a

conscious decision to do something He runs over

CHRIS
LET HER GO YOU HEAR ME YOU ASSHOLE LET HER GO

He strides right into them shoves them off hard The girl is in
tears

TONY
What the fuck you want - shes a dink

CHRIS
NO - YOU STUPID FUCK DONT DONT YOU TOO
BUNNY MOREHOUSE OFF NO DONT DONT

He seems disconnected dazed by the sun like hes talking to
dogs - loud repetitive words coming out of an anger he can
barely control trying to restore some sanity to a world gone
totally nuts today Dont they understand Dont they have any
sense of a mind Any kind of decency

The Men looking at him as if hes the one whos gone nuts not
them Bunny looking at Morehouse looking at Tony looking at
Junior The irony is lost on them as Chris pushes through to
help the poor girl put her scanty clothes back on

CHRIS (CONTD)
(to the girl)
Its okay its okay

Elias appears behind Bunny and the others sees whats happened
He signals them to move out

ELIAS
Get outta here

The men grumble and slink off quietly Elias watching as

Chris helps her to her feet wounded in the intestines

she can

barely stand blood soaking in her nether regions Chris slings

her up as gently as he can and carries her
CHRIS
(as if to himself)
Its okay its okay
EXT VILLAGE - PIG PEN - DAY

their village in ruins homes burning livestock dead

absolutely no trace of outward emotion

Past this Bosch-like canvas Chris - carrying the girl - walks

dazed by the horrors of this long afternoon

EXT VILLAGE TRAIL - DAY

EXT PERIMETER 2 - JUNGLE - NIGHT

The stars are out in magnificent splendor A breeze rustling
through the trees

EXT PERIMETER 2 - CHRIS POSITION - NIGHT

Chris is turning in his sleep perturbed writhing The
whispering is more and more urgent Death is all around He
shoots up out of his poncho liner as if shot stunned Scared
Looks around All is quiet Men sleeping

Elias is huddled in his poncho on guard next to his foxhole
Chris joins him sitting wiping the sleep from his eyes

CHRIS
I cant sleep why dont you get some sack time

ELIAS
dont feel like it either

CHRIS
beautiful night

ELIAS
Yeah I love this place at night The stars
theres no right or wrong in them theyre just
there

CHRIS
Thats a nice way of putting it

Elias cuffs a joint keeping its glow hidden in the dark A
pause both of them meditative

CHRIS (CONTD)
Barnes got it in for you dont he

ELIAS
(philosophically)
Barnes believes in what hes doing

CHRIS
And you do you believe

ELIAS
In 65 - yeah Now
(pause
No What happened todays just the beginning Were
gonna lose this war

CHRIS
(surprised)
You really think so us

Elias eyes seem to go to some inner place his passion surging

ELIAS

» we been kicking other peoples asses so long I
guess its time we got our own kicked The only
decent thing I can see coming out of here are the
survivors - hundreds of thousands of guys like you
Taylor going back to every little town in the country
knowing something about what its like to take a life
and what that can do to a persons soul - twist it
like Barnes and Bunny and make em sick inside and if
you got any brains you gonna fight it the rest of
your life cause its cheap killing is cheap the
cheapest thing I know and when some drunk like
ONeill starts glorifying it youre gonna puke all
over him and when the politicians start selling you a
used war all over again you and your generation
gonna say go fuck yourself cause you know youve
seen it and when you know it deep down there

He plants his fist in Chris gut expelling his breath such is
the force of the blow - like a power passed between them

ELIAS (CONTD)

» you know it till you die thats why the
survivors remember Cause the dead dont let em
forget

His eyes blazing reliving the deaths in the village licking the
wounds for the platoon mourning the failure of its heroism
Chris looking at him a little awed by his intensity Elias
looks away embarrassed that he has sermonized looks back at the
stars

ELIAS (CONTD)
Oh shit Sometimes theres things in my head
man Grass does that to me fucks me all up like a
crazy Indian

CHRIS
Do you believe that stuff about knowing youre
gonna die

ELIAS

Yeah those are the guys that live I really dont
think Death gives a shit its like a giant garbage
can I think it takes whatever it can get you
never know where its gonna come from anyway so
why spin your wheels

He shrugs a certain bravado masking his own uncertainty

CHRIS
» You ever think about reincarnation all that
stuff

A lightning quick movement follows Elias hand passing over his
face like a mime a click of the fingers and he leans closer to
Chris A new expression on his face Devils eyes mocking
child danger in his soul excitement sex - the Elias that Chris
saw in the smoking session in base camp Chris smiles sucked
in almost laughs and then the face is gone again

ELIAS
Sure goes on all the time Maybe a piece of mes in
you now who knows But when you die - really die -
thats a big return ticket

(soft)
I like to think Im gonna come back as as wind or
fire - or a deer

(likes the image)
yeah a deer

He smiles at the thought Chris looks at him looks away A
shooting star falls suddenly and dryly through the cosmos Their
eyes

EXT JUNGLE - STREAM - DAY (RAIN)

leaden fatigued high Passes the roach down to a millimeter
back to Rhah who points to his face

Chris feels for finds the leech on the edge of his lip cursing

Lerner moves away from the clearing working up a slight incline

when the MACHINE GUN FIRE erupts out of the jungle spinning him
- throwing him into the dirt like discarded garbage

The men are down yelling

His eyes moving to SgtWarren lying alongside a tree - calmly
trying to stack his intestines back into his ruptured stomach
Another RPG comes in

Chris makes a conscious decision moves up - bit by bit
shielding himself with tree stumps ant hills laying out fire
trying to get closer to Lerner

Francis following his progress bug-eyed

Fu Sheng now comes up with his M-60 - Harold his loader belts of
ammo flapping against their bodies He fires from the hip
providing cover fire for Chris then pops down

EXT FORWARD POINT - JUNGLE - DAY (DRIZZLING RAIN)

Chris firing out another magazine crawls closer to Lerner
trying to ascertain if hes still alive

CHRIS
Lerner Lerner can you hear me man

Lerner groans A fresh burst of AK fire rakes the area Lerner
jerks spasmodically with the impact of the rounds

Chris spots the sniper In a hole in the ground Twenty-five

meters off Snapping the magazine out of his AK to reload A
live gook

Chris tears off a volley at him but the gook disappears in the
hole This is the moment Chris realizes it its now or never
if Chris intends to get the gook Hes got to make a move before
the man has reloaded his weapon

He pulls his grenade pops the pin He lets the spoon fly off
activating the grenade-timer as he humps to his feet and runs
for the gook hole concentrating concentrating That head is
going to pop up any second with a freshly-loaded weapon and tear
his head off

ris wont make it back to the hole The throw has to be
erfect He wont get another chance He heaves the frag drops
nd rolls away The throw is perfect the golden arc of flight
rom the outfield nailing the base runner It twists cleanly in
e hole The explosion muffled but deadly

tmhoda

Chris scrambles to his feet a look of almost total surprise on
his face He cant seem to believe he did it Pointing his M-16
before him he advances on the hole looking over the muzzle to
see the badly-mangled NVA man twisted at the bottom

Chris hurries over to Lerner Hes in bad shape hit in several
places vaguely conscious

evanescence of beige and green uniforms moving towards him very

scurrying They look like headless ghosts

Chris opens fire

Elsewhere Elias stands silently listens to the forest In the
distance the firefight can hardly be heard His helmet gone his
hair hanging free he is at his best now - alone He hears it
Somebody running through the jungle about 100 yards boots on
leaves coming towards him

He begins to move lateral to the sound His steps unheard
better at this than the enemy

THREE ENEMY FIGURES now appear crouched and moving very fast
with light equipment through the mist

at the men who are stunned to see him here

He steps down into the hutch his face now lit by candle light
A bottle of whiskey in his hand drunk ugly sweating but as
always with dignity possessive of his silence He feels their
fear in the silence enjoys it

contemptuously

Chris slams into Barnes rushing him off his feet Pounding his
face solid blows

KING AND OTHERS
Get that mother babe go Kick his ass kill that
cocksucker

But Barnes is too quick and very strong and takes the blows
getting outside Chris arm twisting and flipping him ina
wrestlers grip - throwing him hard onto his back on the dirt
floor

The expression of the Men watching slumps their hopes dashed

Barnes springs around on Chris straddles him one hand pushing
his face back hits him hard Once Twice

Chris grimaces groans helpless now A flick of sound

A knife whipped out of Barnes boot and pressing against Chris
throat Chris bleeding from the nose and mouth

Rhah suddenly spinning into action fast now realizing what
Barnes intends to do

Barnes eyes tremble in the candle light his scars ugly a spasm
clenching and locking his facial muscles Then suddenly he is
calm again very calm We sense a man of enormous self-control

Suddenly he flicks his knife across Chris leaving a mark below
his left eye

Chris gasps Looking up at Barnes rising off him The boots
alongside his face

buffalo straggling like ants to reconstruct

wires demoralized silent Eye exchanges but no words

Chris sits on the foxhole watching the ambush go out smoking a
joint by himself depressed King comes in with the claymore
wires attaching them to their detonators Their foxhole - as

are all of the Platoons - is positioned just inside the tree line
bordering the LZ so that they are quite isolated from the center
of the perimeter where they first landed

KING

bummer Ten days and a wakeup and Im still dealing
wid this shit - fuckin etcetera and ad infinitum man

and is now over They both sort of know theyll never see each
other again

CHRIS

Barnes walks off

EXT PERIMETER 3 - BATTALION LZ - DUSK

At the LZ King runs out gets on the last SUPPLY CHOPPER with
some other men It lifts off swirling dust the last rays of
daylight

Chris watches from a Battalion CP area waves back - the chopper
sound receding in the horizon the comparative silence of the
jungle now creeping up on the perimeter He turns and starts
back to his foxhole

A man is watching him Hes sitting on a sandbag face in
shadow It startles Chris something about him Something
different A deep West Virginia drawl

SMOKING MAN
Got a light

CHRIS
Uh sure

Goes over reluctantly flicks his lighter cupping it from the
wind The flame catches a sudden uneasy expression in Chris
face as he sees the Smoking Man

We come around and see what Chris sees in the light of the flame
A face that smiles at him like a deaths head a large ugly
blister on his mouth whiskered pale - but smiling A sick man
wouldnt smile like this but he is smiling too intimately as if
he knows Chris from way back But he doesnt Or does he
Perhaps it was the man Chris first saw at the airstrip when he
came in-country The same expression of evil of a man who has
seen too much and died but still lives

Chris feels an unnatural fear passing through him

The Man stands sucking on his cigarette stretches He is thin
and very tall towering over Chris

SMOKING MAN
later

He goes Chris watches him wondering The man never looks
back a leisurely confident stroll In that moment there is an
EXPLOSION from way out in the jungle about a quarter of a mile
Then another then small arms fire Chris looks knows

EXT PERIMETER 3 - RHAHS FOXHOLE - DUSK

On his foxhole Junior listening to the distant firing Bunny is
introspective - talking to Junior as if he were his best friend
although they have nothing in common

disembodied

At the Platoon CP Barnes stands legs akimbo watching the
jungle anticipating the coming fight as overhead we now hear the
155 SHELLS whistle from a 10-mile distance - passing above them -
then pounding down into the jungle in the near distance Barnes
turns glances at Wolfe smiles

At the Company CP Captain Harris is back on the radio

thunder in the Captains ear He looks at his RTO both of them
shocked

EXT NVA JUNGLE - NIGHTDUSK

In the Jungle itself the ENEMY is moving Flurries of movement
and sound blurred visuals Hands taping a piece of cloth to a
tree moving on - revealing a luminous arrow pointing left
Figures moving past it

Hands unraveling a thin wire waist-high backwards

Hands sliding along another wire We now see a moving helmet
with a luminous plaque on the back of it leading a file up the
wire To a Jump-off point about 50 yards outside the US
perimeter Figures crouch Whispers Movement A pen
flashlight on a drawing of the foxhole positions The NVA moving
out in several directions at once

EXT PERIMETER 3 - CHRIS FOXHOLE - NIGHT
On their foxhole Chris and Francis wait anxiously Overhead the
ARTILLERY keeps pounding into the ambush area Now SMALL ARMS
FIRE can be heard picking up at random spots along the perimeter
The battle like a tide is obviously moving closer to them
FRANCIS
Oh shit me I wish I was back in Memphis now oooh

Chris says nothing Suddenly off to their right about 80 yards
a BLUE FIZZLE of light erupts

right on the perimeter so stay tight in your holes
and dont leave em

FLARES now shoot up over the perimeter Reds greens yellows
squeaking as they float down on their parachute hinges throughout
the ensuing battle The perimeter is illuminated at spotty
intervals - sometimes arctic bright sometimes unexplainably dark
until new flares shoot up

Chris Francis Rhah all look up at the light and hug their
holes even tighter feeling naked in the light Flares cut both
ways

RHAH (CONTD)
theyre probing us they gonna go up and down
this line all night trying to get through Stay cool
» Ill be back

Runs out of the foxhole Chris suddenly reacting to a noise out
front gripping Francis and pointing to the sound

A BODY is thrashing towards them about twenty-five yards not

yet visible but a little awkward and lunging in its movement as
if desperate

Francis tense is about to pop his grenade when Chris grabs him
CHRIS
Hold it
(loud whisper)
WHO IS IT
But the body keeps coming lurching now falling

FRANCIS
Come on man

CHRIS
No

A POP - then a fizzle of BLUE LIGHT as the Figure hits their
trip flare - revealing itself to be large with no helmet and
gasping terrified of the trip flare

TERRIFIED SOLDIER
DONT SHOOT DONT SHOOT

CHRIS

Its the ambush
(calling out)
In here man Hurry

The SOLDIER now runs in like a fullback going down for the
tackle sprawling into the hole knocking Chris and Francis down
beneath him

He is sweating terrified a white boy with an unrecognizable
filthy face no rifle no helmet his fatigues torn all over

TERRIFIED SOLDIER
Water Water

Chris gives him his canteen his shoulder and neck hurting from
the collision The Soldier sucks down the canteen

CHRIS
There

SHAPES moving in the trees Chris blows his claymore handles
One explosion on top of the other out front Then return fire
Flashes from a muzzle rak-a-tak rak-a-tak rak-a-tak the
heavier sound of an AK-47

Chris opening up with his 16 Then being blown down by a grenade
explosion at the edge of the foxhole Then nothing A pause
Chris ears ringing slightly concussed

Suddenly from down the perimeter there is the sound of a faulty
LOUDSPEAKER crackling out from the jungle A pidgin English the
words mauled then a snatch of patriotic North Vietnamese music
played from a scratchy old record

Chris uneasy looking at Francis who looks terrified The SOUND
now of a whistle Two hoots then a sharp third Then yelling

Chris grabbing Francis arm pointing There is a VOICE directly
out to the front of them - muttering something in Vietnamese no
more than 20 yards away but unseen Its like hearing a casual
conversation from another room then the sounds of several bodies
moving in separate directions - encompassing the foxhole

CHRIS (CONTD)
(to Francis a whisper)
Out of the hole Fast

Chris crawls out stops looks back Francis wont leave hugs
the shelter

CHRIS (CONTD)
(a fierce whisper)

Goddamit Francis Move your fucking ass Now

THEY GONNA BLOW IT
Reaches in and yanks him with all his strength half out of the
hole Francis finally sparked now moves out Both of them
bellying it into the brush behind the hole
Not a moment too soon An RPG ROCKET whistling in

The FOXHOLE takes a direct hit caving in whirls of smoke
spinning off it

Chris and Francis look back covered with debris They hear
movement

SHADOWS are swarming towards the foxhole firing into it to
finish them off

Francis grabs Chris leg indicating they get out of there

Chris hesitates - a moment a decision made now in angry passion
- rises up and charges the NVA

SHADOWS scatter and tumble caught by his surprise close-range
fire

Chris moving forward into them blasting agile his instincts
finely tuned and totally insane in this moment of time
indifferent to his life He YELLS insanities pumping himself up
with the adrenaline of courage

CHRIS (CONTD)
DIE YOU MOTHERFUCKERS YAAAAAAAAA

Screams from the dark shadows they fall

Chris smashing a wounded SHADOW with the butt of his gun down
into the foxhole He jumps back into it reoccupying it
Blasting the dead gook

Opening fire out to the front driving the Shadows back
Francis watching this amazed After a moment of doubt he too

tears back out to join Chris in the foxhole unbelieving as he
jumps in with him

FRANCIS
(joining in the frenzy)
YAAAAAHHHH KILLLLL

Then stunned again to see Chris suddenly rise up out of the
foxhole and charging forward into the jungle He is now over the
edge

CHRIS
(charging off into the jungle)
DIE YOU MOTHERFUCKERS

EXT PERIMETER 3 - BUNNYS FOXHOLE - NIGHT

In his position Bunny is experiencing the same high as Chris
yells out at them

BUNNY
Come on MOTHERFUCKERS COME ON

Junior huddled in the hole with him speechless and terrified
looks at him with huge eyes The guy is nuts An incoming
grenade explosion shakes the hole

BUNNY (CONTD)
(laying out more fire)
Come on you can do better than that

JUNIOR
Fuck this shit I aint dyin in no white mans war

Ise didi-ing this motherfuckah

Junior freaks out throws his rifle down and hobbles out of the
hole on his damaged feet at an incredible speed

BUNNY
(yelling after him)
Get back here you gutless shit

A SHAPE suddenly out of nowhere looms up fast behind Bunny
running at him

Junior insane now with fear runs smack into a tree knocked
senseless and reeling to the ground

Bunny turning back too late The crazy drug-high Shape is
yelling something like

NVA SOLDIER

And jumps right into the hole blasting Bunny point-blank in the
chest

Bunny struggling to consciousness at the bottom of the hole
THUCK A boot in the gaping hole where his chest was Bunny
his eyes uncomprehending A muzzle is jammed into his mouth
breaking his teeth with an ugly sound Another yell from the NVA
trooper A flash of orange red light Bunnys face blown to
bits

Junior dizzy from the blow to his head looks up

A yellow flare somewhere out there and a SHADOW above him digging
a bayonet into his belly with a grunt A long oozing sigh of
belly gas

An explosion The Shadow with the bayonet staggering blind
without eyes holding his brains with his hands

Barnes throws open the empty LAAW rocket casing he has just fired
off and charges forward with a yell cutting down another NVA in
Bunnys old foxhole Jumping into the hole the bottom of which
is a liquid pit of guts blood ooze Another Enemy running in
on him A short burst of fire Barnes hit Firing into each
other Barnes dragging him down into the pit with him grappling
alongside the corpse of Bunny Barnes uses an entrenching tool
to finish him off

adjacent position Doc a quiet man up to now is treating a

jerks to a stop He is obviously dead but Doc goes on trying to

Ace putting out fire is hit The NVA are coming over his
sandbags A burst of fire Ace goes down

Doc has cracked up firing at anything indifferent to his
safety One of the NVA goes down The Doc is hit in the side
wounded struggles is hit again but keeps trying to fire Hes
hit a third time - in the jugular vein Nearby Wolfe is firing
madly at the oncoming NVA One goes down A second is wounded
yelling in pain Wolfe reloading his 16 popping up too late
One of them is coming over the sandbags He sees Wolfe Wolfe
sees him In the same moment

Wolfe hesitates frozen up The gook unloads his AK-47 a
magazine worth into Lieutenant Wolfe who crashes down sprawled
unnaturally on the jungle floor A spasm shakes his body Then
stops Dead

Boots run by

At his foxhole ONeill peeks up out of the hole Several NVA

are darting through the jungle 20 yards away coming towards him
talking loudly to each other He quickly slips back down in the

The NVA stop glance in the hole Something is muttered They
run out

ONeill opens his eyes breathes

EXT PERIMETER 3 - BARNES FOXHOLE - NIGHT

BARNES swings his mashed M-16 full into the FACE of an enemy
SOLDIER who screams and goes down Barnes chopping at him with
his club His helmet is gone his shirt ripped to shreds his

shoulder bleeding making his last stand against the hated Gooks

Nearby HUFFMEISTER is hit in the shoulder by a running FIGURE and
collapses into the bottom of the foxhole crying out in pain

The running FIGURE runs past right into the full force of BARNES
swinging rifle SMACK He crumples

INTERCUT

Chris bellies into the area see Barnes recognizes him amazed
An ENEMY fires taking Barnes high in the left thigh A patch of
skin blowing off Barnes rigidly goes down on his left knee like

a wounded horse Holds there staring into the Enemy waiting
for the coup de grace

A series of SHOUTS and the Enemy staggers dead as

Chris lays out a curtain of fire A GRENADE goes off near him
blowing off his helmet Dazed Chris rushes forward firing from
the hip - sucked into Barnes suicidal vacuum He cuts down an
Enemy as

Barnes given a new lease limps angrily forward and tackles a
wounded Enemy trying to crawl away terrified at the sight of
Barnes coming after him Barnes lets out a vivid scream

And beats the soldier mercilessly half the stock of his M-16
flying apart broken

Chris swivels alert on his knees A pause No more enemy
Turns to Barnes his back to Chris still beating at the dead

corpse

CHRIS
Barnes

Barnes swivels instinctively off the corpse and for a petrifying
moment Chris sees

A maddened scar of a face lips specked with foam The EYES -
refracted in a red-green flare overhead - the pupils distorted
into angry red points

For Chris it is no doubt the most frightening single image he has
seen in his life It will be in his nightmares forever The
essence of evil wrath obsession anger fear hatred
permanence - he is paralyzed

Barnes smashes him full across the face with the broken stock of
his M-16 Not even consciously for at this point his mind has
gone over the edge and the entire world is his enemy American
or Vietnamese it makes no difference as he strikes Chris harder
and harder

Chris struggles moans his teeth and nose cracked Barnes emits
another chilling yell an springs like a humpback up on his good
right leg the left bent - set to deliver the killing blow the
mangled rifle pulled to its highest arc

CHRIS (CONTD)
Noooocoo00

The PHANTOM FIGHTER JET comes now like a great white whale One
big beautiful monstrous beat of deafening sound Its silver and
white belly hurtling low over the tree line in one giant leap of
sound momentarily illuminated by a flare Then a monstrous ROAR
of anger

The bomb ripping Barnes off the body of Chris and spitting Chris
across the jungle floor - crashing into a tree some 30 yards
away

FADE OUT
EXT PERIMETER 3 - CHRIS JUNGLE - DAWN

FADE BACK IN Vague sunlight Blurry Chris fluttering his
eyes A sharp MOVEMENT in the bush His eyes fight their way
open

SOFT EYES are watching him from behind foliage A soft furry
head alert rigidly still

Chris fights his way up to his elbow in pain looking at the
eyes The head turns and in one fluid move bolts Gone Like
the wind A deer A big brown deer Or was it Chris will
never be quite sure But whatever it was it was surely a sign
of grace - the grace of Elias This he knows as he feels himself
for the first time alive

And in pain His left hand torn and bleeding shrapnel in his
side cuts on his face dried blood caking him Looking around
his garden of Eden A messy jungle floor Cordite fumes

Burned bush and trees Torn sandbags Dead NVA Bird songs
somewhere in the distance It is the very crack of dawn a pink-
red sun casting long oblique light patterns through the trees A
holy light

Chris pushes himself to his feet feels his weight and the pain
He walks In the near distance towards the LZ area theres the

sound of Armored Personnel carriers grinding men moving calling
out in Americanize But Chris is alone here

He fishes up an AK-47 from a dead NVA Checks it a weapon
Walks on

EXT PERIMETER 3 - BARNES FOXHOLE - DAY

Past scores of NVA bodies Past the Foxhole where Bunny lays
dead in the bottom faceless Looking over at Junior bayoneted
to the ground dead NVA everywhere around the hole some of
them still moving badly wounded

Chris looking around then noticing a movement a little further
out in the Jungle Then he sees who

The uniform is shredded the figure obviously hurt in several
places (thigh back neck hand) but not mortally so now
struggling to right itself dragging its face up from a belly-
down position Streaked with dirt and blood we see Barnes once
again re-emerging from the dead

Chris steps over to him a solemn look on his face Barnes looks
up begs

BARNES
Get me a Medic will ya Goon

Chris doesnt move Barnes looks at him again reading the
intention that has crossed Chris mind An expression of
surprise crosses his face then amazement almost shock

BARNES (CONTD)
Fuck you in hell

Chris shoots him Once Twice Three times Silence
Barnes is finally dead

Chris looking at the corpse numbed no exultation in his
expression Just cold satisfaction and little feeling left

Behind him the SOUND of a big machine moving He turns

A huge Nazi flag on an antenna looms up in the bush followed by
the great belly of a turreted dragon crunching down a tree for
its breakfast

A big tough GERMAN SHEPARD comes bounding at him sniffs followed
by a flak-jacketed MONSTER MAN - filthy and greasy unshaven
face earring in his left ear DEATH CORPS scrawled on his
shirtless flak jacket and a drawing of a deaths head he looks
like a cross between a pirate and a hells angel Behind him a
SECOND MONSTER MAN and the ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER grinding its
engine a human skull hanging from its turret

MONSTER MAN
(to Dog)
Bozo Get back here

His eyes passing on Chris like so much meat

MONSTER MAN (CONTD)
(to Chris)
Can you walk outta here

Chris nods The Soldier pointing to the LZ behind him as a sign
he should go that way The other Soldier already stripping the
NVA dead as the APC grinds on into the jungle reconnoitering

Chris walks out of the jungle head bowed nauseated mixed
feelings roiling him

EXT PERIMETER 3 - FRANCIS FOXHOLE - DAY

In another foxhole Francis waits the sounds of the approaching
APC cutting through He thinks about it a moment It must be
fast It must be a hard cold decision Now

He pulls out his K-bar and with one last anguished hesitation
drives it into his thigh muscle

Francis yells out and collapses in his hole
EXT PERIMETER 3 - ONEILLS FOXHOLE - DAY

In another foxhole ONeill unscratched but covered with dirt
waits tentatively as SOLDIERS arrive at his hole Theyre a
little awed by the sight of the tough-looking ONeill emerging
from his foxhole like SgtRock dozens of dead NVA littered
around him

APC SOLDIER 1
You alone Sarge

ONEILL
Fuck yeah They all left me bunch of fuckin
faggots

APC SOLDIER 2
Man you gonna get yoself a silver star

ONEILL
Fuck the silver star You got any booze

EXT PERIMETER 3 - RHAHS FOXHOLE - DAY

Rhah alive and well is poking around the NVA corpses with a
long gnarled walking stick looking like a crazy Johnny Appleseed
with his pants rolled up on his thin hairy ankles and wearing a
red bandana tied in a four-knot around his head

As one of the APC SOLDIERS carves an ear off a dead NVA Rhah
works his way through the torn bloody pocket of an NVA Troop in
full rigor mortis extracting what he thought was there - a
wrapped cellophane of heroin

Rhahs face glows with satisfaction as he tastes it then snorts
it With a certain satisfaction of triumph over the grim
circumstances

RHAH

(to the powder)
Yeah thats good shit

EXT PERIMETER 3 - LZ - DAY

CHRIS is hauled out on a litter Morphined his eyes watching it
all from somewhere deep in his brain Passing

Groups of SOLDIERS looking like bowery bums and moving like rats
through the smoke and garbage snooping for souvenirs with wheezy
tired eyes and grunts of greed

Passing a bulldozed PIT with heaps of NVA BODIES in them a
BULLDOZER pushing another set of bodies in like photos of a Nazi
death camp

Nearby two burly SOLDIERS lift a WOMAN NURSE and with a once-
through build for momentum toss the fresh body into the pit

Chris numb goes by

RADIO OPERATOR
(into radio exhausted)
- 37 US KIA 122 wounded and still counting
Estimate 500 Victor Charlie KIA 22 wounded and still
counting Over

2ND RADIO OPERATOR
Sir a television crews coming in with the General -

CAPTAIN HARRIS doesnt respond at this point he doesnt give a
shit standing apart from the radios looking numbly at the
remnants of his boys filtering by on litters

Chris intersects him now Harris eyes looking blankly then
nodding sickly trying to give him encouragement Just coming to
the edge of tears choking it back and turning back These are
his sons who are lost A good officer

Rodriguez wounded is lifted up in his litter and moved out to
the waiting MEDIVAC CHOPPER a huge red cross painted on a white

square

Doc goes by on another litter then Ace Adams Huffmeister etc

Then Francis is littered by bandages around his leg a big smile
on his face

FRANCIS
Hey Taylor you okay man

CHRIS
Yeah How ‘bout you

FRANCIS
Jes fine man jes fine Aint never felt better
Both of us two timers man were out
(gives him a slap as he goes by)
See you at the hospital man we gonna get high-high
yessir
(goes off)

The Medic points to the chopper

MEDIC
(to Chris)
Thats your ride man you ready

CHRIS
(tries a smile)
You bet

Chris starts towards it the Medic assisting him
EXT PERIMETER 3 - LZ - DAY

SgtONeill watches the loading process forlornly from the
distance Captain Harris intersects him

HARRIS
You got Second Platoon Sergeant

ONEILL
(reflexively)
Yes sir -

And as Harris moves away ONeill is left thinking Finally

there is a certain frustration to his actions he has taken such
great pains to stay alive that the tuition he pays is precisely
to stay in this Jungle Inevitably his time will come - one way
or another

His eyes now follow the MEDIVAC CHOPPER upwards whatever is left
of his shrunken soul yearning to go with it

EXTINT PERIMETER 3 LZ CHOPPER - DAY

As the Chopper rises off the battlefield Chris who is sitting
at the edge so that he has a full view out the open door waves
back at Rhah

EXT PERIMETER 3 - DAY
Rhah at the edge of the tree line vigorously shakes his walking
stick at him his other hand a fist waving them emitting his

cry

RHAH

Defiance Pride Dig me Im Rhah - and there isnt nobody like
me in the world

EXTINT PERIMETER 3 - LZ CHOPPER - DAY

The chopper - with its huge red cross painted on - now rising to
meet God Smashed on morphine Chris looking out at the waving
ants below

Now the trees the skyline and the chopper is moving fast over

the devastation The jungle forever locked in his memory Chris
looks back copious quiet tears flowing from his eyes

CHRIS (VO)
I think now looking back we did not fight the
enemy we fought ourselves - and the enemy was in us
The war is over for me now but it will always be
there - the rest of my days As I am sure Elias will
be - fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called
possession of my soul There are times since I
have felt like the child born of those two fathers
but be that as it may those of us who did make
it have an obligation to build again to teach to
others what we know and to try with whats left of
our lives to find a goodness and meaning to this life

The music surges now to its full strength as we replay bits of
film with each actors name listed - some with silly clowning

looks

others sober haunted Gardner Tex King Rhah Lerner

Sanderson Manny Big Harold - all the boys and then Barnes
staring quietly into the camera and lastly Elias - shirt off
bowl of grass in hand his big beautiful smile

End

FADE OUT
