Okay this is the work-in-progress FINDING NEMO film transcript
Why is it work-in-progress you might ask Well for one this
isnt a 100 accurate transcript some words might be missing
may not be right Second some lines may or may not have been
spoken by the right character There are instances in the film
where a line is spoken but the character isnt on screen which
makes things complicated But Id say this transcript is about
98-99 accurate Dialogue for each scene is seperated by a line
of equal signs ()

This transcript is open for corrections additions if you have
any What you CANT do however is to edit it and take credit
for it Although I do not own the movie or its screenplay this
transcript was made with no intention of copyright infringement
and the like Enjoy And remember Fish are friends not food
