INT PAULS APARTMENT BEDROOM - DAY

BLINDING WHITENESS
We hear a MAN GASPING softly Rhythmically
A LUMINOUS PALE SHAPE slowly forms out of the searing
whiteness Gradually we realize were moving across the
ALABASTER BODY of a WOMAN Her skin translucent

ON THE WOMANS FACE
Ethereal Her eyes closed Her face lifeless

her eyes open She looks straight at us with unseeing
pale blue eyes This is ANNA (late 20s)

We pull back PAUL (30s) makes love to Anna Their
movements perfunctory Passionless He turns to look at
her Realizes shes not there He suddenly stops

Rolls off her Sits on the edge of the bed

PAUL
Whats wrong

ANNA
Nothing
Anna leans down and picks up her RED SLIP from the floor

PAUL

(SIGHS WEARILY)
You used to enjoy it Now its
He shakes his head Frustrated Lights a cigarette

PAUL
-its like fucking a corpse
Paul immediately realizes hes gone too far Turns to
Anna

PAUL
Shit Im sorry That was-â€”
Anna gets out of bed Walks towards the bathroom Paul
puts his head in his hands

INT PAULS APARTMENT BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Through the fogged shower partition we see the blurred
ghostly figure of Anna Paul walks in

PAUL
Anna Im sorry That was a stupid
thing to say But you know sometimes
sometimes its like youre not here
anymore Like youre somewhere else

Anna doesnt reply

PAUL
Is this about us

ON ANNA
her head bowed as she lets the water wash over her

ANNA
ts not about us
PAUL (0C)
Then what is it
ANNA

PAUL (0C)
just want us to be happy
Anna doesnt move We sense the emptiness inside her
PAUL (0C)

Are you happy
She closes her eyes Forces herself to reply
ANNA
Im happy

A DROP OF BLOOD
falls into the water Then another drop

ON ANNA
her nose is bleeding She touches her lips Looks
impassively at the blood on her fingertips The SOUND OF
WATER carries into the next scene

FADE TO WHITE

A STREAM OF CRYSTAL BLUE WATER

A MANS HANDS penetrate the water Thin and elegant
Perfectly manicured Turning slowly as he washes them
meticulously He picks up a crisply folded white towel
Dries his hands carefully Snaps on white latex gloves

EXT CEMETERY - MORNING

A beautiful morning We move through a tranquil cemetery
Pastoral and idyllic Dappled light falls through old
trees onto statues of grieving angels

INTEXT ANNAS CAR - MORNING

Anna drives past the strip malls of a small suburban town
in a GREEN TOYOTA On the dashboard a KITSCHY BOBBLEHEAD
DOLL nods its head from side to side Anna pulls up toa
red light Glances across at the other cars We see the
vacant faces of COMMUTERS staring blankly into space

INT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Anna slips her phone back into her bag as she walks
through the deserted corridor Her high heels echo

loudly in the eerie quietness

Suddenly one of the fluorescent ceiling lights behind her
blows out with a loud WHUMPH Anna starts Turns

WHUMPH The next light dies Anna quickens her step

The lights go off one by one The darkness quickly
creeping up behind her Theres only one light still on
as she reaches the exit She looks up The light
flickers But then strangely stays on Bathing her in a
cold pool of light
Annas unsettled She turns and frantically pushes the
door It doesnt open She pushes hard with both hands
Nothing Its locked She turns back slowly The
darkness around her impenetrable Almost viscous She
reaches out

her hand DISAPPEARS into the thick blackness Anna
snatches her hand back Stares at it
Then we hear the sound of SLOW FOOTSTEPS Moving

deliberately towards her

ANNA
(NERVOUSLY)
Hello
Her voice echoes down the silent corridor She glimpses

something move in the blackness
ANNA
Is someone there

A BLACK SHAPE materializes inside the darkness Silent
Brooding Anna cant move Terrified Suddenly the
corridors flooded with a BLINDING WHITE LIGHT

tentatively pulls her hand away

freshly COIFFURED WOMAN politely holds the door for her

cradled against the white porcelain The lights harsh
and not particularly flattering She closes her eyes

raincoat above her head She stares at Paul for a moment
through the window marbled with rain

Spills some of his red wine on his shirt
CLOSE on the red stain It unfurls like a flower
Spreading out over the white material

INTEXT ANNAS CAR HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Anna peers through the blurred windshield as the wipers
battle with the TORRENTIAL DOWNPOUR A LARGE TRUCK plows
past menacingly on the rain-slicked highway

CuT TO BLACK

INT FUNERAL HOME ELIOTS ROOM - EARLY MORNING

Darkness A bright light comes on

CLOSE ON a MANS HANDS Turning slowly under a stream of
crystal blue water We pull back Eliot dries his hands
Opens a cabinet Takes out a pair of latex gloves

INT FUNERAL HOME PREP ROOM - EARLY MORNING

A large room Tall vaulted ceilings White tiles Soft
morning light seeps in from a small round window set high
on one wall The room is silent Still Like a chapel

In the semi-darkness we see a BODY on a porcelain slab
covered with a white sheet

We hear a key turn in a lock Then another lock The
rooms suddenly flooded with a harsh white light
Confused

Eliot steps inside the room He takes off his jacket
Carefully places it on a coat-hanger Puts on a pale
blue smock then snaps on the latex gloves His every
move meticulous Measured Like a ritual

Eliot walks over to the slab his surgery clogs softly
clacking against the tiled floor He looks at the slab
for a moment then slowly pulls the sheet away
revealing

ANNAS BODY Pale and lifeless An ugly gash above her
eyebrow Cracked violet lips A rip in her black dress
soaked with a dark stain Shes only wearing one shoe
Eliot gently takes off the watch from her stiff wrist
Places it inside a brown paper bag Eases off the shoe
Picks up a scalpel from a tray of instruments on a steel
trolley Delicately slices open her dress Peels it off
Hes about to cut the straps of her RED SLIP when
Anna OPENS HER EYES

She looks straight at us with unseeing pale blue eyes

Strangely Eliots not surprised He calmly steps back
Watches her carefully
Annas eyes slowly focus on Eliot Shes groggy

ANNA
Where am I
She talks with difficulty Her breathe labored
ELIOT

Youre in a funeral home

(BEAT)
Youre dead
Annas vacant eyes widen in shock She struggles to sit
up but she cant even raise her head Her body stiff
Rigid Eliot speaks to her calmly Soothingly

ELIOT
You had a car accident It was raining
You hit a truck loaded with metal pipes
She looks fearfully at the bloodied dress in Eliots hand

ANNA
Im not dead

ELIOT
You were pronounced dead eight hours ago

Your blood no longer circulates through
your body Your brain cells are slowly
dying Your bodys already decomposing

ANNA
Im not dead
Eliot looks at her sadly for a moment He places the
bloodied dress on the trolley Then picks up a document
Holds it up for her

ON DOCUMENT
Its Annas death certificate

ELIOT (0C)
This is your death certificate Cause of
death Massive internal trauma Time of
death 823PM

PREP ROOM

ELIOT
You were dead on arrival The attending
physician signed here
(points to document)

Â»at 945 last night I picked up your

body from the hospital morgue at 1210

this morning
Anna stares with horror at her death certificate then at
Eliot He looks away It pains him to see her so
distressed

ELIOT
Im sorry
Eliot picks up a sponge from the trolley Wets it

ANNA
Who are you
Eliot delicately washes Annas face She doesnt flinch
as he dabs the wound above her eye brow

ANNA
Dont touch me Why are you touching me

ELIOT
Im preparing your body You have to

look beautiful for your funeral

ANNA
Im not dead
Eliot sighs wearily As if hed had this conversation
many times before

ELIOT
You all say the same thing

(BEAT)
Im sorry Maybe you should rest now
Eliot peels off his latex gloves and heads for the door
As he hangs his pale blue smock on the peg he turns and
looks at Anna for a moment

ON ANNA
The lights go off 0S the door clicks shut as it locks
automatically behind Eliot

ANNA

(SOFTLY)
I cant be dead Its just a nightmare

INT FUNERAL HOME PREP ROOM - DAY

Anna lies rigidly on the slab Her head turned to one
side Staring blankly at the wall Her eyes glazed
Suddenly classical music fills the room Anna frowns
Disoriented She moves her head with difficulty
Nervously looks around

For a moment she doesnt know where she is Then she
sees Eliot by a CD player She watches with trepidation
as he approaches her

ANNA
Please dont hurt me
ELIOT
(SMILES)
How can I hurt you Youre already dead
ANNA
But Im not dead

ELIOT

Then why are you here
Anna doesnt know what to say She turns her head away
A tear falls down her cheek

ANNA
Please Just let me go I wont go to
the police I wont tell anyone
Eliot moves her head back Gently wipes away her tear

ELIOT

Youre still in denial You have to

trust me Im only here to help you
Eliot slides a wooden head-rest under her neck and studies
her wounds touching them delicately Thinking about how
to conceal them He turns to a tray of instruments
Picks up a needle Leans over Anna
The needle pierces her brow Sliding cleanly through her
skin She doesnt feel any pain as Eliot carefully sews
the wound Hes meticulous Clearly very good at his job
Eliot glances at his watch Picks up a SYRINGE and an
AMPOULE OF AMBER LIQUID Draws up the amber liquid
Annas alarmed She tries to pull back

ELIOT
Dont be scared

ANNA
What are you doing

ELIOT

This will relax your muscles Stop the
rigor mortis setting in so I can work on
your body
He INJECTS Anna in the neck Just then we hear a car
pull up on the gravel driveway outside

ELIOT
(TO HIMSELF)

Annas eyelids feel very heavy Slowly her eyes close
Eliot pulls the white sheet over her body

hand through the white sheet Then uncovers Annas face
The needles still embedded in her eyebrow

ELIOT
Ah Forgive me
Eliot quickly steps forward Pulls out the needle Cuts
the thread with a pair of large scissors

the slab Hard She feels no pain She does it again
Harder Still nothing

ANNA

washing his hands

ELIOT

ANNA
Thats none of your business
Eliot shrugs Dries his hands on a white towel
ANNA

You werent going to tell me Paul was

ELIOT
No

ANNA
Why not

ELIOT
Because it would only hurt you You have
to let go of the living Just like they

Just then something catches her attention

The light from the window glints off a pair of LARGE
SCISSORS on the steel trolley Anna stumbles to the
trolley Feeling her way through the semi-darkness
Grabs the scissors

Just then she notices a BODY covered with a white sheet
lying on a gurney in the corner She turns away
Scared But then almost against her will she
approaches the gurney As if drawn to the body She
slowly pulls the sheet away

The dead body of an OLD WOMAN Staring blindly at Anna
with cloudy opaque eyes Long greasy gray hair Shaken
Anna pushes herself against the wall

ANNA
Oh God Please I dont want to die

touches the car Pulls open the door Squeezes into

Turns it lower He glances at his watch Takes out his
keys from his jacket and moves over to the Prep Room door

carefully watches Eliot as he pulls on his pale blue
smock then walks over to a cabinet

BEHIND ANNAS BACK

Eliot opens a cabinet full of boxes of hair dye with
photographs of smiling women As he prepares the dye he
looks across at Anna Shes staring at something behind
him Eliot turns Sees the uncovered body of the Old
Woman on the gurney He quickly walks over Carefully
pulls the white sheet over the Old Woman

ANNA
Who is she

ELIOT
Mrs Whitehall
He mixes the dye in a bowl as he moves over to Anna

ELIOT
You shouldnt be afraid of her The dead
cant harm the dead
ANNA
(FORCEFULLY)

But Im not dead
Annas hand suddenly FLIES UP she slashes at Eliots
face with the SCISSORS
The sharp edge misses his cheek by inches Eliot drops
the bowl Stumbles back against the steel trolley
Instruments crash to the floor
Anna staggers to the door Her legs weak Her long lank
hair falling over her eyes She frantically wrenches at

hers

wavers

the door handle but its locked Eliot gets up Slowly
moves towards Anna She turns Raises the scissors

The sharp tip pushes into his skin

ELIOT
Go on

For a moment we think she might do it But then she
ELIOT

What are you waiting for
Annas confidence falters She slowly lowers her hand
The scissors fall onto the floor Anna looks down
defeated Her breath labored Suddenly she realizes

ANNA
Im breathing
(raises her head)
Look Im still alive
ELIOT
You think youre still alive because
youre still attached to life Its
normal Youre just imagining you still
have symptoms of life
Shes not listening Eliot takes a roll of paper towels
Kneels down picks up the bowl of dye and mops up the mess

ANNA
Maybe I was in some kind of coma The
doctors made a mistake Theyre always
making mistakes

ELIOT
You died Everyone dies

ANNA
How can I be dead if were talking
He stands up Sighs wearily
ELIOT

Were talking not because youre alive
But because I have a gift

(BEAT)
I can talk to those between life and death

ANNA
Why

ELIOT
To help them make the transition
Annas stunned For the first time we sense a seed of
doubt in her mind

ANNA
Is this what happens when you die

ELIOT
It depends on how you lived your life

ANNA
What do you mean
ELIOT
Not everyone needs my help Some let
go as soon as their body dies Others
dont let go until long after theyre
in the grave

ANNA
Am I a ghost Is that why Im here

ELIOT
Youre here so I can bury you
Annas silent Trying to make sense of what shes just
heard Eliot takes her arm Leads her to the slab

ELIOT
Come Weve wasted enough time already
She lies down submissively Suddenly very tired Eliot

leans over her to apply whats left of the dye
ANNA

(WHISPERS)
No Please I dont want--

ELIOT
Youre a corpse Your opinion doesnt
count anymore

ANNA
But I can breathe I must be alive
She weakly pushes him away Anger flashes across Eliots
face but just as quickly he controls it

ELIOT
You people You all think that if you
breathe shit piss youre alive
Anna doesnt know what to say

You clutch onto life as if your life was
worth clutching onto Was your life
worth clutching onto Anna
Anna turns her head away Clearly hes struck a chord

Look Shes accepted her death Her
life has been examined She has no more
regrets And now shes at peace She
used her time well You still have so

ANNA
I have nothing to learn

ELIOT

Eliot stands in the doorway He switches off the light
His body silhouetted by the light from the hallway

ELIOT

youll be enclosed in a coffin Then

buried in the ground No-one will hear

you then No-one will talk to you there
The door clicks shut behind him Anna doesnt move
Clearly unsettled by Eliots words After a moment she
looks at the Old Woman She moves over Hesitantly
pulls away the white sheet Stares at the Old Woman
curiously Then tentatively touches her cheek

ANNA
Are you cold

She takes the Old Womans hand Strokes her paper-thin

table an alarm clock reads 238AM He looks across at an
Anglepoise lamp in the corner of the room bent over an open
shoebox He gets up Walks towards the muted light

though its eyes are open Jacks about to reach into the
box Then changes his mind He looks at the lamp Switches
it off After a moment he switches it back on again

INT PAULS APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Paul stands motionless in the middle of the room Staring
blankly into space The room feels empty and depressing
He suddenly looks around Not quite sure why he came into
the room in the first place He moves over to a CD player
Mechanically switches it on Music fills the room He
turns the volume higher Then all the way up The musics
unbearably loud but Paul just stands there Numb

The musics strangely distorted now Almost silent

if we were inside Pauls head
INT FUNERAL HOME PREP ROOM - NIGHT

Anna lies on the slab Curled in a fetal position 0OS
we hear the UNNATURALLY LOUD metallic drip of a faulty
faucet Slow Rhythmical Anna opens her eyes Stares
at us Terrified Then she turns her head

The Old Woman sits on the other slab Slowly brushing
her tangled gray hair with a silver backed brush

Anna looks around anxiously The room is strangely
larger The perspective not quite right Certain
objects look absurdly small or abnormally large She
notices a TINY DOOR Half hidden by a steel trolley

he doors slightly ajar Annas surprised

he Old Woman shakes her head Staring blindly at Anna
with opaque eyes Anna ignores her Moves quickly to
the tiny door As she approaches the door seems to grow
to normal size

hen we realize its Anna who has shrunk The steel
trolley now towers high above her The massive
instruments on the trolley look like menacing insects
cast in surgical steel She opens the door Revealing a
solid wall of DARKNESS

FROM INSIDE THE DARKNESS

the small shape of Anna in the doorway The huge dark
space engulfs her The only light comes from the Prep
Room behind her

PREP ROOM
Anna reaches forward Her hand disappears into the thick
blackness She snatches her hand back Scared Then
Â»a CHILDS HAND darts out of the darkness Grabs Annas
wrist Pulling her in with surprising strength Anna
struggles to free herself But the hand drags her deeper
into the darkness The door slams shut behind her

INT DARKNESS
Anna stands in the black empty space

GIRLS VOICE (0S)
Im disappointed with you
An innocent looking YOUNG GIRL materializes out of
the blackness She looks like a young Anna

ANNA
Who are you

The Young Girl walks slowly towards Anna

GIRL
You promised me so many things

(AMUSED)
You dont recognize me
Anna shakes her head

GIRL
I am you Ive been waiting for you
You shouldnt have disappointed me
The Girl now looks strangely malevolent Anna steps back
terrified Turns But theres no door anymore

Shes confused She gets up awkwardly Looks around the

Anna stumbles over to the trolley Pushes it aside
Desperately searching for the tiny door She touches the

wall Theres nothing there Frustrated she turns to a
counter crowded with instruments She sweeps her arm
across the counter top in rage Sending everything
crashing to the floor

INT FUNERAL HOME VIEWING ROOM - DAY

The funerals over Eliot takes out a wilted bouquet of
flowers from a vase

In the bg Jack stands half-hidden in the doorway
Glancing around in fascination A flower in his hand

ELIOT
(to Jack without looking up)
Can I help you
Jack steps back timidly Eliot looks up Smiles

ELIOT
Then perhaps you can help me
(holds up the withered flowers)
Could you throw these away for me
Jack nods hesitantly Moves over and takes the flowers

ELIOT
Thank-you
Eliot turns and arranges fresh flowers in the vase

ON JACK
as he looks at the wilted flowers He crushes a petal
then sniffs his fingers

ELIOT (0C)
Theres no life left in them

ELIOT
They belong in the garbage
Jack turns to leave

ELIOT
Ah Miss Bryant No Her funerals not

JACK

(SHRUGS)
It was OK I guess
ELIOT

Oh I see

JACK

us in different ways

JACK

(CURIOUS NOW)
What do you mean
Eliot finished arranging the flowers He glances at his
watch Smiles at Jack

ELIOT
It was a pleasure talking to you Jack

Jacks intrigued He watches Eliot walk out of the room

INT FUNERAL HOME BASEMENT CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

As Eliot heads to the Prep Room we hear a MUFFLED CRASH
from inside Eliot quickly pulls out his keys Moves to
the door Just then Eliot hears a creaking sound behind
him He turns Jacks at the top of the stairs

Staring down curiously at the Prep Room door

Eliot observes him cautiously Did Jack hear the sound
as well Jack looks back at Eliot Smiles Then

without a word turns and heads back up the stairs

INT FUNERAL HOME PREP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Anna sits on the floor in the middle of the room
Hugging her legs to her chest Rocking to and fro

Surrounded by broken glass torn papers and instruments

Eliot enters the room Coldly surveys the destruction

ELIOT
(ANGRY)
Why did you do this
Anna ignores him Eliot strides over to her
ELIOT
WHY DID YOU DO THIS
Anna stares at him blankly
ANNA
Is this the afterlife Am I in heaven
Or am I in hell
Strangely Eliots not surprised He nods his head
anger gone now
ANNA

The door

(POINTS DISTRACTEDLY)

There was a door Just there

ELIOT

(GENTLY)
It wont be long now

I used to believe in God I thought Id
see him when I died Instead I saw you
Eliot softly strokes her hair Comforting her

ANNA

(WHISPERS)

His
Maybe you are God

ELIOT
Youll be at peace soon I promise
For a moment we see a deep sadness in Eliots eyes Hes
conflicted But then abruptly he pulls himself together
Moves away and starts clearing up Anna closes her eyes
Hugs her legs closer to her chest

ANNA
Paul
She lets out a DESPONDENT SIGH The SIGH carries into
the next scene

EXT CEMETERY - DAY

The tall trees stand motionless amongst the graves A
sudden GUST OF WIND bends the dense foliage Their
leaves ripple Languid and fluid like a wave RUSTLING
EERILY The sound almost malevolent

INT PAULS APARTMENT BEDROOM - DAY

Pauls red-rimmed eyes snap open He lies on his bed
fully clothed An empty bottle of bourbon on the bedside
table Behind him the curtains stir

The KITSCHY DOLLS head begins to slowly nod Turning
towards us We hear the eerie rustling sound again

Like a MURMURING WHISPER

ANNA (0S)

(WHISPERS)

Paul
Paul turns quickly Sees the open window Its only the
wind He shivers It suddenly got very cold He gets
up and closes the window The WHISPERING starts again
This time from the bathroom
Paul walks over to the bathroom door As he touches the
door handle the whispering STOPS Paul hesitates
The rooms strangely silent He slowly opens the door

INT PAULS APARTMENT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Nothing The bathrooms empty Paul looks around
nervously He catches the reflection of his pallid face

in the mirror Leans wearily against the washbasin

Water DRIPS from a leaky pipe The fluorescent bulb over
the mirror CRACKLES softly Paul turns on the taps
Splashes cold water on his face Hes about to reach for
a towel when he senses something He cocks his head
slightly A feeling

He turns and checks out the bathroom Nothing Paul
dries his face As he replaces the towel the sound of
dripping water ABRUPTLY STOPS Silence

Suddenly the SHOWER STARTS RUNNING

Pauls paralyzed with fear Steam wreathes the room ina
cloud of vapor He turns slowly towards the shower

PAULS POV
Anna stands in front of the shower with her back to him
She slips off her bathrobe and hangs it on a hook Then
her hand moves to her chest Theres a STRANGE WET
SUCKING sound
asS Anna rips out her heart and hangs it casually on
the hook next to her bathrobe

ON THE STILL BEATING HEART
dripping crimson blood onto the bone white tiles

BATHROOM
PAUL

(WHISPERS)

Anna
Anna turns slowly Her skins like alabaster Unnaturally
translucent A bloody gash where her heart used to be
The steam from the shower curls around her like a mist
She looks hauntingly beautiful Mesmerizing A line of
thick black fluid trickles from her nose Paul turns
away Horrified When he turns back a second later

As Vincents hand moves down her body he bumps against
the trolley Instruments CRASH to the floor He pulls
back the sheet just as Eliot enters the room

Eliot notices the sheet covering Annas body is slightly
askew He reaches over and straightens it Then looks
coldly at Vincent Theres an uncomfortable silence

door locking shut behind him Eliot stares at the door

ELIOT
I just told you That was your brother
(turns to Frank)
You had an accident Youre dead Why

Frank doesnt move His mouth still wired shut
ELIOT
No Its not a gift Its a curse

Eliot picks up a compact Roughly layers Franks cheeks
with thick rouge With every word he gets more agitated

ELIOT

I take care of each of you as if you were

my children I wash the shit from your

bodies I dress you I do everything to

make you look more beautiful than when

Eliots extremely irritated now He grabs a garish red
lipstick Smears Franks lips

ELIOT
You argue with me As if it were my fault
youre dead As if I was to blame
(slams down the lipstick)
What Youre not talking to me now You
dont want to

ON FRANKS FACE
The crudely drawn bright red lips Clown-like circles of
rouge Gaudy and macabre

ELIOT (0S)
You dont talk because you have nothing
to say And you have nothing to say

talk again

ELIOT
No Now I dont want to talk to you
anymore

Eliot looks at him for a moment
ELIOT
You cant help her anymore Believe me

INT POLICE STATION - DAY

An open plan office Paul weaves quickly through the
rows of desks He seems unbalanced Manic DETECTIVES
cautiously watch Paul approach Tom sitting at his desk
his head bent over paperwork

PAUL
I need you to issue a search warrant
Tom looks up Hes shocked by Pauls appearance
PAUL

(LOUDLY)

I need a fucking search warrant Now are

you going to help me or what
JEFF (20s) a Young Detective at a nearby desk stands
Tom nods to him Its under control

TOM
Paul Sit down
Paul hesitates for a second
TOM
(FIRMLY)
Sit Down
Paul sits Tom leans forward Hes not amused
TOM

Just what the hell do you think youre
doing I got a call from Eliot Deane
Are you out of your fucking mind

PAUL
Annas not dead Tom He wont let me see
her Hes keeping her there--

TOM
Anna was in a car accident Her car was
wrecked Paul Remember Its downstairs

PAUL
Shes not dead
Tom calmly gets up Moves to a filing cabinet Takes
out a file Hands it to Paul

TOM
Heres the Coroners report
Paul manically rifles through the file

PAUL
Look
(shows file to Tom)
The paramedics phoned it in They only
checked for eye dilation and pulse The
doctor signed the death certificate
without even seeing her body
TOM

(IRRITATED)
So Thats standard procedure

PAUL
There was no EEG Nothing He could
have drugged her to make it look like she

was dead
TOM
Drugged her Are you serious
Jeff looks up eagerly from his desk
JEFF

There are drugs like that chief
Hydronium Bromide Total paralysis
within seconds The heartbeat slows to
almost nothing

Tom shoots Jeff a look

PAUL

Paul turns hopefully Finally someone believes him
Vincent Merano stands by Jeffs desk

VINCENT

Paul hesitates We sense his uncertainty
PAUL
I think she called me
TOM
Called you
PAUL

(WEAKLY)
On the telephone
Jeff snickers Pauls beginning to realize how absurd
this all sounds

VINCENT
Collect or long distance
Jeff snorts with laughter

TOM
First you hit a fucking kid Then you
attack Deane And now youre telling me
your dead girlfriend called you What the
fucks going on Youre loosing it Paul
Merano and Jeff shake their heads looking at Paul as if
he were crazy Toms voice softens

TOM
I know you feel guilty but youve got to
pull yourself together

Paul slumps in the chair Rubs his face

PAUL
Maybe youre right But why wont he let

me see her
Tom signals to Merano and Jeff Merano walks back to his
desk Jeff turns back to his work
TOM
Look Paul The funerals tomorrow
Youll see her then Itll help It

EXT CEMETERY - LATE AFTERNOON

The suns low on the horizon Eliot whistles softly to
himself as he digs a grave Working meticulously Like
everything else he does Suddenly a SHADOW falls over
Eliot He calmly looks up The suns behind the figure
For a moment Eliot cant tell who it is

JACK
You said you could teach me
Eliot smiles Gestures to Jack to come inside the grave
Jack steps back The grave terrifies him

ELIOT
Its only a hole in the ground Im
digging it for--

JACK

Miss Bryant

ELIOT
Exactly For Anna She belongs here

JACK
Because shes dead

ELIOT
No Because theres no life left in her

Jack carefully considers Eliots words
ELIOT

Dont you see I have no choice Im
the only one who can see all these
corpses Wandering the earth
aimlessly All they do is piss and
shit Suffocating us with their
stench Doing nothing with their
lives Taking the air away from those
who actually want to live I have to
bury them all I have no choice

(BEAT)
Now theres two of us

Eliot holds up the shovel Jack looks at him for a
moment then reaches for the shovel

INT FUNERAL HOME PREP ROOM - EVENING

Anna watches Eliot brush an invisible speck off her
mothers black dress

ELIOT
You did well this morning

ANNA
This morning
She talks with difficulty now Her voice SLURRED and
HOARSE Her words muddled and rambling Her eyes even
more sunken Her skin even more pale

ELIOT
When Paul came You did the right thing
You let him go

ANNA
Hell be all right now Wont he
Eliot looks away Doesnt reply He drapes the dress
over his arm picks up a pair of shiny black shoes and
moves over to her

ANNA

(CONFUSED )
Why do I have to get dressed

ELIOT
Tomorrows your funeral
Eliot lifts Annas arms and puts them through the sleeves
of the dress Her bodys stiff and unyielding

ANNA
Already
ELIOT
I told you You only had three days
He delicately turns her onto her side Buttons up the

dress
ELIOT

I told you to use your time well
Anna frowns As if trying to remember something Eliot
gently lifts her legs Pulls on a pair of black tights

ANNA
I need to I have so many regrets I
have nothing but regrets

She looks up at him Suddenly realizing
ANNA
Thats why Im here isnt it To be
judged
Eliot picks up Annas shoes Slips them onto her stiff
feet
ELIOT
Youre here to understand your life So
you can finally be at peace
ANNA

I wanted a different life
Eliot picks up a nail-clipper Gently holds Annas hand
as he carefully cuts her long nails

ELIOT
Then why didnt you do anything about it

ANNA
No matter what I did everything just
stayed the same Id wake up Id
shower Sit in the same traffic
everyday on my way to work Go home
Go to sleep Then wake again
Eliot stops clipping her nails Irritated

ELIOT
What did you really want from life

ANNA
I just wanted to be happy

ELIOT
(DERISIVELY)
Happy You all say you wanted to be happy
What does it mean Anna To be happy

ANNA
I dont know Dont you understand
Thats the whole point I dont know

ELIOT
Yes you do Youre just too scared to
admit it to yourself
Anna turns away ashamed She knows hes right

ANNA
I dont want to talk about it anymore
just want this to be over

ELIOT
What did you want from life

ANNA
I dont fucking know

ELIOT
WHAT DID YOU WANT ANNA

ANNA

(SCREAMS BACK)

I WANTED LOVE OK
Annas stunned Shes finally admitted it

ANNA

(QUIETLY)
I wanted love

ELIOT
You had love Paul loved you

ANNA
No You dont understand I was scared
I wanted to love but I didnt know how

I was

(BEAT)
When I was a child my mother
Anna struggles to pull together her thoughts

ANNA
When I was a child I learnt that love
That when you love someone You get
hurt So I learned not to love That
way no one could ever hurt me again

She looks down at the slab Touches the cold marble
ANNA
I was always pushing Paul away He

thought I didnt love him

ELIOT
Did you

ANNA
He was the only one I ever loved But I
never told him that And then he stopped
loving me

Eliot stares at her intently Comes to a decision
ELIOT
What would you do if you had another
chance

Annas puzzled Eliot goes to the door and unlocks it
Moonlight floods in from upstairs Washing it with a cold
light Anna doesnt move

ELIOT
Well Isnt this what you wanted
Eliot holds out his hand Anna takes it hesitantly and

rises from the slab

Anna approaches her mothers house Paul opens the door
Hes not surprised to see her
Beatrice stands just behind him A black shawl over her

head and arms

INT MOTHERS HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT

In the candlelight we can see the house is full of OLD
WOMEN Their faces deeply lined Wearing identical
black shawls They stare at Anna whispering in
different rhythms Unintelligible words undulating like
an ANCIENT PRAYER

INT MOTHERS HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT

Paul and Beatrice lead Anna to the bed As she lies down
we realize the bed is full of BLACK SOIL Clouds of ugly
flies hang in the air BUZZING noisily

The Old Women surround Anna in a tight circle Leaning
over her Making her feel claustrophobic She can smell
their rotting breath as their prayers grow LOUDER
Through the chaos of words we begin to make out

OLD WOMEN
Spit it out
Anna doesnt understand Then she feels something in her
mouth Growing Gagging her The Women are SCREAMING

OLD WOMEN
Spit it out
Anna spits out white maggots She gags again
her eyes Shakes her head
ANNA

No

pushes the earth over it The box jerks We hear the
faint RUSTLING of the Chick inside

JACK

Eliot walks through the garden A pair of small secaters
in his hand He stops by a bed of violets Still

covered in morning dew He kneels and starts cutting the
delicate flowers

INT FUNERAL HOME PREP ROOM - DAWN

Anna lies on the slab in her burial dress Her eyes
closed

Eliot enters the room He doesnt lock the door behind

him Doesnt turn the lights on Doesnt change into

his mortician smock

He approaches the slab The violets in his hand Pulls

over a chair and sits next to Anna Places the violets

on the steel trolley beside her

He looks at her intently For the first time he seems

uncertain Vulnerable As if questioning himself

After a while he suddenly gets up and heads towards the
door Hes about to close the door behind him

ANNA (0C)
I dont even know your name

ON ANNA
Her eyes still closed

ON ELIOT
Eliot pauses Too confused to look back at her

entwining her fingers

ELIOT
You have to look beautiful for your
funeral
He picks up a SYRINGE and an ampoule of AMBER LIQUID
Fills the syringe

ON AMPOULE
We glimpse the label HYDRONIUM BROMIDE

This will relax your muscles Make your
skin radiant As if you were still

This is how theyll all remember you

ANNA
Can I see myself for the last time
Eliot smiles Picks up a mirror Hands it to Anna
ON MIRROR
Anna looks peaceful Beautiful Serene
ANNA

Is this the end

ELIOT (0C)
The last part is the most difficult
Youll have to face it alone But youll
be at peace soon
Anna nods SIGHS deeply her BREATH FOGS the mirror
She frowns Touches the SMALL CIRCLE OF CONDENSATION on
the glass Looks up at Eliot in shock

PREP ROOM
Eliot glances anxiously at the fogged mirror then at Anna

ANNA

You lied to me

ELIOT
Anna Weve been through this before
Youre just imagining--

ANNA
You lied to me
Eliot injects her in the side of the neck Anna tries to
raise her hand to push him away but shes too weak

ELIOT (0C)
Youre still clutching onto life Dont
give in to your fears Youre so close

Annas fading away Her hand drops limply to her side
ANNA
(WHISPERS)
Why did you lie to me
She stops struggling Stares blankly at us

Eliot looks at her for a moment Sadly Regretfully
He picks up a Polaroid camera The flash explodes ina

blinding white light He pulls out the Polaroid Peels
off the front and fans it in the air Then
ON ANNA

delicately closes Annas eyelids

ELIOT (0C)
Good bye Anna

Eliot gestures to Beatrice Diane wheels her to the casket
Beatrice looks at Anna for a moment then touches the
violets in Annas hands

DIANE
Violets They were her favorite flowers

touches her cheek again Finally accepting her death

Begins to screw down the lid

Suddenly the screwdriver slips Gashes his finger

INT FUNERAL HOME ELIOTS ROOM - SAME TIME

is the glimmer of life In some a despairing pleading
look In others passive resignation

curve ahead suddenly an SUV comes out of the corner
A bright white light sweeps through his car Pauls

something unnerving about the silence
Suddenly a CROW rises noisily into the air Paul starts
Then watches relieved as the crow disappears into the
dark sky He turns back to Anna shes not there

Paul looks round desperately Runs between the stone
crosses and statues of grieving angels searching for her

so much
A line of BLOOD trickles from his nose He touches his
lips Looks blankly at the blood on his fingertips A
drop of blood falls on Pauls white shirt It unfurls
like a flower Spreading out over the material

ANNA
I love you I always did
Anna hungrily kisses him He responds passionately
Suddenly we hear a SHARP METALLIC SOUND

PAUL

(ALARMED)
What was that
Anna responds as if it was nothing strange

ANNA
Its only the scissors
We see the growing anxiety in Pauls eyes Annas just
interested in his lips

PAUL
Scissors What scissors
ANNA
Scissors For your clothes Eliot just
put them on the table
Paul pulls back Terrified
ANNA

Youre safe now Were finally together

Slowly the room comes into focus

pulverized Your brain cells are slowly
dying Your bodys already decomposing
