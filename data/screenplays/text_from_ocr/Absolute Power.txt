1 INT WASHINGTON MUSEUM - DAY
The saddest eyes you ever saw

We are looking at an El Greco drawing It is a study for
one of his paintings

PULL BACK TO REVEAL --

A bunch of art students are doing sketches of the eyes
the elongated fingers the slender hands El Greco drew so
brilliantly

Most of the students are around 20 A couple of suburban
housewives are there too

And one older man
This is LUTHER WHITNEY Mid 60s very fit neatly

dressed At quick glance he seems as if he might be a
successful company executive

As we watch him draw we can tell he is capable of great
concentration And patient With eyes that miss
nothing He has pilots eyes

Well find out more about him as time goes on but this
is all you really have to know Luther Whitney is the

hero of this piece As we watch him draw --

Luthers sketchbook He is finishing his work on the
eyes and hes caught the sadness Its good stuff

Luther Its not good enough for him He looks at his

An enigmatic smile Now from that --

EXT REDS BAR - DAY

A nice working class part of town Nothing fancy here

but theres a pleasant feel The streets are clean
houses neat and well tended

Luther carrying his sketchbook walks along Its
afternoon now Up ahead is a local bar REDS

INT REDS BAR - DAY

the

Luther walks in Nothing fancy here Strictly working

class And relatively empty An overweight bald man

each other)

(as Luther hands
him a videotape)
Your life would be a whole lot
simpler if you could learn to

LUTHER
My only failing

As he turns --

EXT NEIGHBORHOOD - LUTHERS HOUSE - DAY

A street of small row houses Clean well tended

Luther walks toward one Later in the afternoon He
carries half a dozen small shopping bags from the
market the hardware store the drug store the cleaners

EXT LUTHERS HOUSE - DAY

A terra cotta planter to the right of the front door
Luther shifts his packages tilts the planter slightly
bends down pulls out a key inserts it in the front
door

INT LUTHERS HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

as he enters Neat tidy A Cuisinart a cheese slicer
lots of other nice equipment As he begins putting food
away --

INT LUTHERS HOUSE - DINING AREA - NIGHT

Evening now Table set for one A single candle
Beside the candle is Luthers sketch pad Now Luther
himself moves INTO VIEW carrying a tray He puts it
down

A gorgeous omelet is on a fine china plate parsley
sprinkled neatly on top An elegant green salad is on
another plate covered with thinly sliced parmesan
cheese An expensive water pitcher a lovely glass
Clearly a great deal of thought has gone into dinner

Luther lights the single candle We are now aware of a
photograph nearby The picture is old A pretty little

girl stands in the center smiling Her mother stands
alongside smiling too A man is with them looking at
them happily Its Luther When he was young

Luther studies the photo a moment Then he turns looks
out the window

POV SHOT - SLIVER OF MOON 8
is visible Lovely Peaceful
LUTHER 9

Now Luther opens the sketch pad quickly flips past the
hands and eyes and faces --

-- we are looking at something totally different a
mansion

HOLD ON Luthers drawing of the mansion
KEEP HOLDING

PULL BACK to reveal --

EXT SULLIVAN MANSION - NIGHT 10
In the moonlight -- it looks exactly like his drawing

But no drawing could convey the size of the place -- we
are looking at ten thousand square feet Wealth and
power

Were in rolling hill country The mansion is dark
Totally deserted Silence

Now a sound - TIRES ON GRAVEL A car comes rolling INTO
VIEW The motor of the car has been turned off The
lights of the car have been turned off The car slides
to a stop Again silence

HOLD ON mansion a couple of hundred yards away There

is a small field between the car and the estate Now --

EXT SULLIVAN MANSIONINT LUTHERS CAR - NIGHT 11
A man holds binoculars studying the place He wears

dark clothes tennis shoes He puts down the binoculars

begins to smear his face with black camouflage cream --

-- its Luther and hes been a professional thief his

entire life Hes a three-time loser but his last
sentence was so long ago and his’ skills are now so vast
so refined that it is unlikely he will ever get caught
again

EXT SULLIVAN MANSION - GROUNDS - NIGHT

The grounds as Luther glides through it He wears a
backpack

The night is cool

He stops All that separates him from the mansion now is
a stretch of gorgeous lawn Except for Luther it isnt
gorgeous -- its no-mans land

One final check of his surroundings -- then he sets off
in graceful motion long strides eating up the ground
He makes no sound at all

EXT SULLIVAN MANSION - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

Thick wood with reinforced steel

Luther stops by the door takes off his backpack opens
it He puts on plastic gloves that have a special layer

of padding at the fingertips and palms Now he takes a
key inserts it in the front door turns it and the

instant he pushes the door open -- ZOOM TO

INT SULLIVAN MANSION - FOYER - NIGHT 14
The infrared SECURITY DETECTOR -- it immediately starts
to BEEP and you can see the seconds being counted down
forty thirty-nine thirty --

CUT TO
LUTHER 15

-- in his hands now is an automatic screwdriver no more
than six inches long --

-- he sets to work on the security panel that is inside
in the foyer next to the front door

The screwdriver undoes the first screw the second --

CUT TO

SECURITY DETECTOR 16
Thirty-one thirty twenty --

CUT TO

SCREWDRIVER 17

Now the third and fourth screws are in hands and he lifts
the security panel away

The BEEPING sound is constant --
-- and getting louder
A tiny device no bigger than a pocket calculator It

has two wires protruding from it It is we are about to
find out a tiny computer Luther holds it like a baby

CUT TO
SECURITY DETECTOR 18
Eighteen seventeen --

CUT TO
LUTHER 19

probing with the wires into the heart of the security
panel

19
The BEEPING is LOUDER still

The security panel Luther is attempting delicate work

and its dark so it isnt easy but he continues to probe

with the wires and --

CUT TO

SECURITY DETECTOR 20
Eleven ten --

CUT TO

25A

LUTHER 21

and hes got it attached

COMPUTER 22

Now the face of the tiny computer is alive with numbers
-- they fly by much too fast for us to make them out
clearly

CUT TO
SECURITY DETECTOR 23
Four three two --

CUT TO
FACE OF TINY COMPUTER 24
as five numbers lock -- 7 -- 13 -- 19 -- 8 -- 11 --
The BEEPING sound dies

CUT TO
LUTHER 25
A glance across the foyer -- the lights of the security

detector go from red to a warm looking green
Safe

He allows himself to exhale Then hes busy again
unhooking the computer His fingers as always work
quickly precisely

INT SULLIVAN MANSION - FOYER - NIGHT

The foyer as Luther once again carrying his backpack
moves across it Behind him the front door is again

shut the security panel back on screws all in place

Its as if he hadnt been there at all

INT SULLIVAN MANSION - STAIRCASE - NIGHT 26
Luther walks quickly up -- and here we get a sense of the
vast size of the place -- it feels bigger inside than it

looked in the moonlight

A Van Gogh at the head of the stairs Luther moves past
it then stops goes back studies the painting Its a
late one when the madness had him and things were
sliding away Very sad

Luther looks at it admiringly for another moment --

-- then surprisingly he raises his hand and for just an
instant traces the lines of the painting in the air as
if trying to figure out how the magic was done as if
getting ready for his next museum session --

-- then almost grudgingly he moves on up toward the
third floor

INT SULLIVAN MANSION - THIRD-FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT 27

Heres a Hopper One of the great ones filled with an
overpowering sense of being alone --

-- Luther stares at it almost in awe whispers wow

moves on

INT SULLIVAN MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT 28
Luther walking down the third-floor corridor

The corridor walls No paintings here -- instead we see

a series of framed photographs The first is of a baby
girl the next one of the same child at three

We watch the child grow up in these photos At ten she
is already pretty At fifteen a stunner

ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev 51696 8
28

Not a classic beauty by any means she is turning into
if you will a latter-day Ann-Margret The kind of girl
you ached for in high school The perfect cheerleader

These are pictures we will come to know of Christy
Sullivan A high school graduation shot at eighteen a
shot in front of a Burger King at twenty

CLOSEUP - WEDDING PHOTOGRAPH

Christy looking just fabulous is 24 and smiling
happily We can only see her face and the wedding veil
here Now --

PULL BACK to reveal --

A glorious and expensive white wedding dress Christy
holds a bouquet of flowers Breathtaking

KEEP PULLING BACK

And now we can see the groom Walter Sullivan Walter
is smiling too one arm proudly around his lovely bride

Walter it might be noted is eighty years old
Luther staring at the photo shakes his head Now he

moves on

INT SULLIVAN MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 29

Luther opens the DOOR It SQUEAKS He goes inside
closes the door firmly Next he puts his backpack down
takes out a low-power non-glare work light sets it up
Now he looks around A huge room a gigantic canopied
bed

A nightstand alongside which contains a small silver
clock three Danielle Steel novels piled neatly one atop

the other several more photos of the happy couple --

-- and an antique silver-plated letter opener with a
thick leather handle

Luther He studies himself in front of a very large
full-length mirror across from the canopied bed

Now we realize something -- he isnt studying himself
hes studying the mirror itself

He turns goes to the sitting area where there are chairs
and a sofa and a large TV and VCR

29

Three remotes on a side table Luther carefully picks up
the middle one crosses the room with it points it at

)B(

the large mirror clicks once --
-- and the mirror swings silently open

A room is revealed All we can see of it so far is this
There is an armchair in the middle facing where the
mirror had been

Luther turns back toward the sitting area the remote
held in his hand

The side table Luther puts the remote down -- very
carefully In the exact position it had been Now he
takes a moment blows on his hands rubs them together

Then -- Luther takes a collapsible duffel bag out of his
backpack moves with the work light into the revealed
room --

INT SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - VAULT - NIGHT

Its a vault And its FULL Theres cash naturally
piles of the stuff Plus all kinds of other valuables
well get around to

Luthers a little stunned -- its more than he hoped for

He glances at the armchair -- there is a remote on it
that is identical to the one he replaced at the side
table

Now he opens his duffel all the way and sets to work
First the cash goes in -- all neatly bundled Large
denominations Lots of bundles Next are a series of
slender boxes --

The first box as Luther opens it

Jewelry

Into the duffel it goes

Luther emptying more jewelry boxes into the duffel
still more As he continues to do this --

INT SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

All is quiet High on a wall the security light beams a
friendly green

Now from somewhere a distant sound LAUGHTER Was
laughter Doesnt matter its gone

ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev 51696

And

it

INT SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT 32

Luther has moved deeper into it -- hes finished with the
jewelry Now hes examining piles of bonds

Into the duffel they go

He takes a breath glances around Perfect

Coins Antique ones They disappear into the duffel

Stamp books Gone into the swelling duffel

Luther as he hears now the DISTANT LAUGHTER Not so

perfect

INT MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 33
He moves quickly out of the vault takes a step toward

the door -- the GIGGLING is getting LOUDER closer Two

people A man and a woman

Luther stops mutters shit -- glances around -- No

place to hide Luther grabbing his backpack moves into

the vault turns off his work light and shuts the door

with the remote The DOOR CLICKS --

INT SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT 34
-- Luther is alone in the darkness

A burst of LAUGHTER now Growing nearer still

Luther moves into the back of the vault crouches down

doing his best to hide behind the armchair Trapped
Luther waits in silence trying not to breathe

Now he can hear a SQUEAK -- the BEDROOM DOOR has opened

HOLD

INT SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 35
Dark -- except for a slant of light from the hall outside

the open bedroom door

Two people are briefly visible as they enter a MAN anda
WOMAN The CLINK of GLASS Stifled LAUGHTER

The Woman closes the bedroom door

Darkness again

And now the LAUGHING sound increases GIGGLING really

INT SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT 36
Luther in the pitch-black vault The GIGGLING is MUTED
but it is there He is starting to perspire
INT SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 37

The woman flicks on the lights and as she does --

INT SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT 38

Luther as the burst of light hits him like a fist -- and
its over

Luther blinks confused looks around --
-- because it isnt over he hasnt been caught

The door to the vault is suddenly gone Luther is
staring straight into the goddamn bedroom

Because the door is a two way mirror Now its as if he
was watching the bedroom on a giant TV screen

Just a few feet away just outside the door

Where things are clearly starting to heat up

Luther moves to the armchair sits There is nothing to

do now but wait He settles in

INT SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 39
They are staring at each other

We have seen the woman already -- shes CHRISTY SULLIVAN
But the pictures in the corridor did not do her justice

This is a fabulous-looking twenty-five-year-old woman
Long golden hair a round face that sets off her deep
blue eyes a tanned curving body A bare-shouldered
black dress An expensive necklace

One more thing she is staggering drunk

The man is ALAN RICHMOND wealthy successful handsome
and fit Mid-forties He wears an elegantly-cut suit

Two additional points Richmond is clearly not the
husband in the wedding photo He is drunker than she
is

39
Richmond carries a vodka bottle and two tumblers He
fills them gives one to her
They touch glasses Down the hatch Tight laughter
He looks at her
She looks at him Theres a lot of sexual tension in the
air
But now he begins looking around checking things out
She spots this
CHRISTY
(drunk)

Its okay -- I told him I was

sick -- anyway hes gone --

relax
He nods then more at ease And he blows her a kiss
She catches it -- and now she starts to parade for him
Her body moving very slowly
He pours himself another shot chugs it watches Now --
INT SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT 40
Luther suddenly terrified and we find out why
INT SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 41
Christy fumbling with her necklace looks across the
room -—
What shes looking at the side table with the remote
that opens the vault
INT SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT 42

Luther frozen as Christy starts toward the table

INT SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 43

The table and the remote waiting there

INT SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT 44
Luther mouth dry

ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev 51696 13

INT SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 45

Richmond reaching out for her then as she passes him
he takes her by the hand --

-- and now they are dancing their bodies pressed
together They move slowly She hums He tries to get

fancy spin her with one arm --

-- no good Theyre too drunk for it starts to lose
balance separate

They giggle Smile at each other Now Christy manages

to unhook her necklace and as she starts to drop it in
the drawer of the nightstand --

INT SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT 46
Luther A genuine sigh of relief --

-- which suddenly dies --

INT SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 47

Christy as she spins toward the table again still with
the necklace in her hand

INT SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT 48

Luther and theres nothing he can do now but watch

INT SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 49

Richmond watching too emptying the vodka bottle into
his tumbler chugging it down and now

The table as Christy reaches out grabs a remote turns

INT SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT 50

)B(

Luther dead in the water because --

CHRISTYS

pointing the goddam thing at him --

-- and as she CLICKS it --

ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev 51696 14

INT SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT 52

Luther and for a moment hes like a goddam deer caught
in the headlights --

-- but now here comes another sigh of relief and we find
out why

INT SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 53

Suddenly theres ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING -- shes turned
the STEREO ON Christy starts humming replaces the
clicker drops the necklace in the drawer

Then they are into each others arms Their bodies
press Their bodies sway He moves a hand to her
breasts --

-- Christy breaks loose shakes a finger at him as if to
say naughty naughty --

-- then with one hand she pulls a zipper down The
dress falls off her body Her breasts spring free She
is wearing only her panties now and high heels And a
smile

She is stunning looking and she knows it and men have

always gone nuts over her and she knows that too And
Richmond cant resist her either goes to her bends her
back caresses her neck begins sucking her nipples

Christy moans

INT SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT 54
Luther in the chair embarrassed averting his eyes

But the MOANING from the other room GROWS LOUDER more
insistent

INT SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 55

Christy pulling away for a moment starting to work at

Richmonds tie shakes him out of his suit jacket

reaches for his belt loosens it She is working at his

shirt buttons now and their breathing is audible and ina
moment he is down to his boxer shorts and then her

panties are off her shoes kicked away and they are near

the vault mirror now As they approach it they stare at
themselves

INT SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT 56

Luther moving farther back in his chair as their faces
are just a couple of feet away --

ABSOLUTE POWER - Rev 51696 15
INT SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - CLOSEUP - CHRISTY - NIGHT 57
as Richmonds hands move across her wondrous body and she
is hot and drifting into drunken fantasy and her eyes

close and --

CLOSE ON RICHMOND

as his eyes are open --

-- the look on his drunken face is scary

INT SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT 58

Luther transfixed by that look transfixed and worried

INT SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - CHRISTY AND RICHMOND 59
IN CLOSEUP - NIGHT

looking at each other now and she is smiling happily and
looking at him and he is smiling happily and looking at

her and whatever was on his face just before has gone

INT SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT 60
Luther watching as they turn for the gigantic canopied

bed

INT SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 61
The bed as they stop alongside it and kiss -- its their

first And her arms go around his neck and she holds him
like that her eyes shut tight --

INT SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT 62

Luther -- watching because Richmonds eyes are not shut
they are wide open and they stare at the mirror and the
awful look from before is back only worse and then
without warning he grips her buttocks roughly --

-- and slaps her hard on the ass over and over and
Christy is shocked surprised pulls away Richmond
smiles at her sweetly

Christy Shaking her head

Richmond He continues to smile makes a courtly
gesture kissing her fingertips in apology

62

Christy She smiles in acknowledgement and they move
onto the bed She pushes him down and straddles him

Richmond from her POINT OF VIEW -- a wonderfully-
handsome man

Christy from his POINT OF VIEW A glorious vibrant
young woman She smiles touches her lips to a finger
reaches out touches the finger to his mouth

Its a sweet moment
They smile

Then he reaches up and without a word grabs her breasts
and squeezes and twists them brutally and Christy is
shocked and she tries to make him stop but he wont and
she cries out in pain but he still wont stop so she
slaps him in the face He slaps her back viciously
right in the mouth and now there is blood mixing with her
lipstick and she rolls off the bed onto the floor

Christy sits there stunned

CHRISTY
(slurred)
You fucking bastard

And on that --
Richmond standing now reaches down to help her up

Christy hesitates finally takes his hand and as soon as
she is on her feet --

Christy kicking him with all she has in the stomach

INT SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT 63

Luther silently applauding

INT SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 64
Richmond the air momentarily out of him falling

drunkenly to the floor stunned for just a moment and

clearly in pain but he is a big man and he is strong and

he grabs her ankle yanks and then both are laboring on

the floor and Christy kicks him again and again --

-- but he will not release her ankle Each kick only
inflames his drunken rage

64
RICHMOND
(very slurred --)

You little whore --
And now they both try and stand
Neither one does it gracefully neither one does it
quickly but Richmond gets there first and as soon as he

is on his feet he begins to strangle her

Christy gasping terrified she claws at his arms her
fingers scratching deeply --

-- but he will not let go
She twists and jerks her body --

-- no good -- he continues to tighten his grip on her
throat --

-- and spreads his legs for better balance

The bed table as Christy beyond desperation reaches
around for something anything -- her fingers finally
close on the letter opener and in one wild stroke she
slashes his right arm

Now he lets go And stares stunned at his bleeding
arm

Then he crunches her flush in the mouth a brutal blow

and blood pours from her nose and mouth and if she
werent so scared maybe it would have stopped her but
it doesnt -- because somehow she manages to maintain
balance --

-- and knees him all she has in the nuts

Its over -- Richmond falls to the floor helpless He
lies on his back holding his crotch

But it isnt over Christy blood pouring down her face

stands over him the letter opener still tight in her

hand

And in her eyes you can see it the homicidal rage --

-- and she drops to her knees beside him --

-- and Richmond can only lie there watching her --

-- and she gets a better grip on the letter opener --

-- and Richmond still only lies there watching her -- 64

-- and she raises the letter opener slowly very high
above her head the point aimed at his heart --

-- and Richmond screams one time --

-- and as Christy starts to kill him two well-dressed

men in business suits burst through the bedroom doorway

GUNS in their hands and they BLOW HER BRAINS OUT before

the opener reaches Richmonds heart

INT SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT 65

Luther in SLOW MOTION and this is what he does --

-- he reels back in the chair eyes wide jaw slack
mouth open --

-- this is a man who has seen everything but nothing has
prepared him for this --

-- his arms flop over the arms of the chair his body
loses strength he tries to look away cant --

-- and this is what he sees --

INT SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 66
Christy fighting for another instant of life --

-- no chance --

-- the two bullets have shattered her brain her eyes

roll up into her head the letter opener drops to the

rug she collapses like a rag doll --

-- and blood is everywhere

INT SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT 67
Luther Back in regular motion now Pale barely able

to breathe

INT SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 68

The two well-dressed men in business suits
BILL BURTON is the more formidable Mid-40s he looks
like a retired tight end No body fat Intimidating
But right now he is shaking and he cant stop it He
puts his gun away goes to Richmond

68

TIM COLLIN is closing in on 30 Handsome In wonderful
shape Burton is more physical Collin more lethal He
puts his gun away goes to Christy

Richmond is trying to sit He is as drunk as before but
now he is also close to shock He reaches over manages

to pick up the bloody letter opener

RICHMOND
Kill her

Collin by the body nods

BURTON
No choice in the matter

His words are efficient but clearly he has been rocked
Richmond staring stupidly at the letter opener He

drops it back to the floor tries to stand cant
Burton helps him back to the bed Which is when he

)B(

passes out cold
Burton and Collin look at each other now

BURTON

No choice in the matter

INT SULLIVAN VAULT - NIGHT

Luther staring at it all The shock is still there but

INT SULLIVAN MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER) 73
A clock on the side table beside the three clickers

There is the sound of a VACUUM -- its later now

The place is incredibly changed Christy is lying as

before -- except now she is fully dressed The bed has

been made with clean sheets There is a large black

garbage bag that Collin shoves the sheets in dumps in

Christys jewelry Burton is VACUUMING the rug

Richmond is visible still in terrible shape finishing
putting his clothes on in the open master bedroom

Everyone wears gloves
Everything that is incriminating is gone --

it in along with the sheets and the jewelry

RUSSELL

RICHMOND
Gloria -- I killed her --

Russell turning shocked as Richmond bears down --

-- she holds out her arms for him but he is staggering
and he collides hard with her spins against the wall

Thats nothing -- why do I bother
to have her strip and then put her
clothes back on

LAURA
There I can help you -- see
before you were a burglar you were
a dry cleaner and you still love
beautiful clothes

SETH
And I dress her because

didnt want her embarrassed when

BURTON

WALTER SULLIVAN

When I was 10 my father died -- he
was a miner and lung disease

and the first thing I did was
purchase that mine close it and
give every miner there fifty
thousand dollars to retire on

(beat staring at

You will come to Washington Mr
McCarty You will put one million
dollars expenses into the Swiss

Who is he

SETH
Luther Whitney --
(beat)
-- one of the great thieves of the
world

Seth The words pour out

SETH

Been going nuts with this thing
up all night and I remembered your
notion how it might be two
burglars and around dawn I
thought wait what if it wasnt
two burglars but what if it was
one guy trying to throw us off by
making it look like two

(faster)
Called a buddy at the Bureau --
they keep track of this stuff
internationally -- he says maybe
only a half a dozen guys alive
could have pulled off the Sullivan
job -- Im tracing all six --

(beat)
-- but Whitneys the only one
lives in Washington

Laura Looking at Seth now Starting to get excited

too

LAURA
Why havent I ever heard of him

SETH
Because he hasnt been arrested in
thirty years

LAURA
(indicating mug shot)
This his graduation picture from
Harvard

Seth enters the room casually taking it all in He
approaches the group ends up behind Luther who is intent
on getting the hands right

LUTHER

Boy you must be smart

SETH
(really taken aback
Sorry

LUTHER
Usually takes a week for you guys
to get to me
(turns smiles)
You look just like your picture

Seth Im Luther Whitney

He reaches out to shake a surprised Seths hand --

INT MUSEUM - COFFEE SHOP - DAY 168

They walk in go to the food line There is throughout
a bantering tone Not that it matters but these two in
a different world would like each other -- theyre both
in their own ways deeply moral men

LUTHER
So do you want my confession now
or after coffee

As Luther draws some coffee from an urn --

SETH
(doing the same)
Before I send you away for life I
should probably check out your

alibi

168
LUTHER

Watched the Bullets game with Red

Bransford Prison buddy of mine

-- runs a bar -- want to question

me about the game Im probably

lying

They each give the cashier some money and we see a quiet
table in the corner as they head for it

SETH
You been following the case

LUTHER
(nods vigorously)
I love true crime --

SETH
-- FBI feels only a few guys
could have handled something as
hard as the Sullivan job
(touches his notebook
Ive got a list here youre on
it

LUTHER

(nothing shows)
I wish it was true

(shakes his head)
Your robber actually went in the
front door but came out down a
rope in the dark in the middle of
the night

(as Seth nods

Luther sighs)
If only I could do stuff like that
-- Id be the star of my AARP
meetings

Luther and Seth as they sit Seth smiles looks at
Luther

SETH

(beat)
Luther Why was this so hard

Luther Now hes surprised He kind of smiles

LUTHER
You want me to help solve your
case 168

SETH
Just looking for insight How
would you -- scratch that -- how
would one go about it What kind
of person do you think I should be
looking for

LUTHER
(like a shot)
Older fella Like me

SETH
(now he smiles)
Because

LUTHER
Need patience The secret is just
research research research --
from everything Ive read

Seth This hasnt gone at all the way he thought -- and
hes starting to get fascinated

SETH
Research for what

LUTHER

Well from what I can tell on the
tube its not a small house

(as Seth nods)
There had to be an architect
right Youd be able to tell
which one from public records in
the library And once you know
the office you could break in and
find the plans and Xerox them get
them back before morning

SETH
Not just steal them

LUTHER

Seth -- breaking in isnt hard --
whats hard is breaking in so no
one knows youve been there Now
after the architect next youd
want the contractors office --
and the security companys office

(beat)
You know the skill involved
breaking the security of a
security company

(shakes his head)
I wonder how those guys do it

168 168

SETH
Why go to all that trouble

LUTHER
Papers said he kept the money in a
vault yes
(as Seth nods)
Well Im guessing there was
probably some secret way to open
it --

SETH
(casually)
-- clicker --

LUTHER
(fascinated)
-- explain --
SETH
-- gizmo -- looked like a VCR
remote --

LUTHER
(shaking his head)
-- amazing --
(beat)
-- must have been a lot of money
inside

SETH
(sipping casually
a pause)
Five million

And on those words --

Luther more than he thought a lot more -- but of course
nothing shows -- instead he breaks out laughing
SETH

Whys that funny

LUTHER
The way you said it -- as if you
were trying to surprise me

SETH
(smiles)
I was trying to surprise you

LUTHER
(smiles back)
There you go

168 168
Seth sips his coffee takes out his notebook opens it

SETH
Would the burglar use a disguise

LUTHER
Seth youve got to get with the
program you expect to catch this
guy -- most likely it is a guy am
I right Some kind of weird
loner

SETH
Maybe like you

LUTHER

(couldnt agree more)
Im the perfect prototype

(sipping away)
But you see any face often enough
youll start putting things
together Thats why these top
guys disguise themselves I read
a great article a couple of years
back -- damn I wish I could
remember where -- anyway it was
about these makeup experts some of
them use -- wigmakers people like
that

SETH
(flipping a page)
Go on about the wigmakers

LUTHER

(glancing at his watch)
Id love that but Im late as it
is -- got to get my pacemaker
checked

(he likes Seth)
-- all this excitement you
understand

SETH
(and he likes Luther)
A) You dont have a pacemaker and
B) Ill be back tomorrow
