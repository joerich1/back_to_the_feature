CuT TO
THE LOUD HARD CHOPPING OF A HELICOPTER PROPELLER
EXT PACIFIC OCEAN -- DAY

Blinding sunlight as the helicopter WHIPS by speeding above the
Pacific Ocean

INT HELICOPTER -- DAY
Norman 53 disheveled unshaven sits in the back He studies a

pamphlet in his hand AITRCRASH SURVIVAL HOW TO COPE The
PILOT in
the cockpit turns to him

PILOT
What kinda work you in Dr Johnson

Norman quickly stuffs the pamphlet into his dufflebag

NORMAN
Im in psychology Was Still am

The pilot glances back at him again

PILOT
Must be another Johnson then Been

NORMAN
Whos everyone

PILOT
Physicists mathematicians
geologists you name it
NORMAN
Geologists At a plane crash

PILOT
Strange isnt it In the middle of
the ocean no less

NORMAN
What the hell would a geologist be
doing at a plane crash

Norman looks out the window and sees a group of ships circling in
the
water

EXT SHIP DECK -- DAY

The helicopter descends down onto the helipad wind gusting
about A

young female OFFICER -- holding her hat to her head -- rushes to

greet Norman as he climbs out of the helicopter

She looks down crudely at his shotty nylon dufflebag

OFFICER
Any other bags Dr Johnson

NORMAN
Just that Careful its heavy

She lugs it over her shoulder no problem

OFFICER
No other equipment Scientific
instruments

NORMAN
No they didnt say --

OFFICER

Norman follows the officer away from the helipad

INT SHIP

She leads Norman down a flight of stairs
OFFICER

Captain Barnes wants to see you
right away sir
As they march down a hallway

NORMAN

EXT BARNES OFFICE
Norman stands in front of the door The doorplate reads PROJECT
COMMANDER -- CAPTAIN HAROLD BARNES Norman straightens his big-
knotted

tie Deep breath
INT BARNES OFFICE

As the door opens Barnes is putting down the phone rises from
his
desk as Norman steps inside

BARNES
Dr Norman Johnson Welcome aboard

They shake hands

NORMAN
Thank you Colonel

BARNES
Captain

NORMAN
Captain Right forgive me

Barnes looks at Norman sizing him up An akward silence

NORMAN
Well thanks for the opportuninty
here -- my wife appreciates it
BARNES

Dont thank me Dr Johnson You
werent my choice The Pentagon made

NORMAN
(smiling)
The Pentagon I didnt know I had
friends in Washington

Norman tries to laugh as Barnes ushers him to the door
BARNES
Come with me The teams already

waiting

NORMAN
What team

INT HALLWAY

Barnes leads Norman down the corridor lined with OFFICERS and
GUARDS

BARNES
What have you been told so far
NORMAN
The usual Plane crash Survivers
unknown Routine stuff really

BARNES
Anything else

NORMAN
Nothing else

A GUARD unlocks a large steel door

GUARD
Captain Barnes Dr Johnson

NORMAN
Hello

Norman looks at the guard as they proceed through the doorway
wondering how the guard knows his name

BARNES
You talk to any reporters Any
press

NORMAN

Press No I havent
The steel door shuts loudly behind them

BARNES
Good Securitys been our biggest
worry Now that youre here we can
shut this thing down tight

NORMAN
From what Whats with all the
security

BARNES
Well we dont have all the facts
yet

Another GUARD opens up another large steel door
INT TECH ROOM

Barnes leads Norman through the room crammed with video
monitors

screens and grids Officers talk into radios Technicians work
on
computers

BARNES
Were moving fast considering the
storm

NORMAN

Storm What storm

BARNES
A cyclones on its way in I
thought they would have told you on
the phone

NORMAN
They didnt tell me anything

Norman tries to keep pace

BARNES
Weve had divers working around the
clock Take a look at this

ANGLE ON a large VIDEO SCREEN -- shows a diver walking on the
ocean
floor holding a bright artificial flashlight

NORMAN
How deep is he

BARNES
A thousand feet

NORMAN
A thousand An airplane crashes into
a thousand feet of water -- I dont

want to sound pessimistic here but
I assume there are no survivors

BARNES
Survivors No I wouldnt think so

NORMAN
Then why am I here

BARNES
What

NORMAN
What do you need me for
ON THE VIDEO SCREEN -- the diver shines his light on a large
metallic
OBJECT

BARNES
What crashed wasnt an airplane Dr
Johnson Its a bit larger than
that

Barnes walks toward a TECHNICIAN sitting at a keyboard

BARNES
(to technician)
Bring up the grid would you

ANGLE ON THE MONITOR as an IMAGE OF THE CRAFT begins to form

NORMAN
What is it A military spacecraft
Like a shuttle or satellite

BARNES
Something like that
(beat)
That doesnt surprise you

NORMAN
Not really no Something of the
military crashes in the ocean -- it
explains why there was nothing on
the news why youve kept everything
a secret When did it crash

BARNES
As best we can estimate it crashed
four hundred years ago

A beat

NORMAN
Four hundred Youre kidding right

ANGLE ON THE MONITOR -- showing a grid depicting an image of the
craft
and a small layer of ROCK above it

BARNES
See this Coral Geologists measured
the coral growth on top of the craft
to be over five meters thick

NORMAN
INT

Geologists

BARNES
Coral grows at a rate of two anda
half centimeters a year --

NORMAN
-- Wait a second --

BARNES
-- dating the crash at least that
old

NORMAN
Hold on --

BARNES
Maybe older --

NORMAN
-- theres got to be some mistake
here -- a four hundred year old
military spacecraft Theres no such
thing our space program isnt even
forty years old

BARNES
Extraordinary isnt it

NORMAN
Its impossible

BARNES
Im afraid it is Dr Johnson
because its sitting on the bottom
of our ocean floor

STAIRWELL

Barnes and Norman shuffle down the stairs

BARNES
Off the record I dont mind telling
you this thing scares the shit out
of me

NORMAN
It doesnt make any sense

BARNES
We think it might Thats why we
brought you here Weve assembled
your team -- theyre waiting for us
now

NORMAN
What team

BARNES
The one you recommended In the ULF
report you wrote for the Bush
administration

NORMAN
ULF report Nobodys mentioned that
in years You mean someone actually
read it

As they head down a hallway Barnes pulls the ULF REPORT out from
under his arm hands it to Norman

Norman looks at it almost embarrassed to be holding it

BARNES
Your reports become our bible down
here Dr Johnson Weve been
carrying out each of your
recommendations -- one by one -- to
the smallest detail

NORMAN
But sir I dont understand This
report -- these recommendations

theyre for an encounter with extra-
terrestrial life

INT BRIEFING ROOM
ON A VIDEO SCREEN -- sonar video of the spacecraft

BETH (0S)
How big is this spacecraft

BARNES (0S)
Of what were able to measure
roughly twenty-six hundred feet

TED (0S)
A half a mile long

BARNES
The wing dimension alone is larger
that any aircraft weve seen
The team members sit around the conference table

TED FIELDING 41 geologist boyish and happy to be here BETH

apron

ARTHUR LEVINE 54 marine biologist pudgy and quiet HARRY
ADAMS 32

mathamatician African-American wire-glasses no bullshit

HARRY
How much damage

BARNES
To the craft None Not a scratch

HARRY
Right So youre saying it survived
a high speed impact with water
without a scratch

BARNES

Im not saying anything Harry Im
just stating the facts

(continuing)
The outer metal is made of a
titanium alloy built into an epoxy-
resin honeycomb The necessary
technology to bond this type of
metal has never been invented

TED
Never invented

ON NORMAN watching the team

BETH
In basic English what does all this
mean

BARNES

Basic English Theres no way this
spacecraft was constructed on our
planet

A LOUD MECHANICAL WHIRR

INT TESTING ROOM -- LATER

A large X-Ray APPARATUS moves to the side revealing Normans
FACE

ON BETH -- standing next to him
BETH
Five years No phone calls What am
I -- a leper

Norman sits up

NORMAN
Beth look can I trust you with a
little secret

BETH
love secrets

NORMAN
That ULF report everybodys patting
me on the back about

fq

BETH
ve read it twice Norman Its
brilliant

NORMAN
ts bullshit The reports a joke

BETH

(beat)
Thats quite a secret

fq

NORMAN
spent a week reading Sagan and
watching re-runs of the Twilight
Zone Seriously I was just trying
to pay the mortgage on my house -- I
had no idea --

ANGLE ON TWO NAVY CORPSMEN standing behind glass in the next
room
monitoring Beth and Norman

BETH
Do yourself a favor Norman Are you
listening Dont tell anyone what
you just told me

NORMAN
Cmon Beth -- that reports like
the blind leading the blind

BETH
Because when we get down there --
NORMAN
Wait -- down where

BETH
To the spacecraft To investigate

NORMAN
Underwater

BETH
What do you expect For them to
bring it up here

NORMAN
We cant go down there Were not
prepared That deep That takes
years of training Beth Were just
scientists Lab scietists We wear
ties and lab coats to work -- not
oxygen tanks

BETH

Well you must have realized the
chances an encounter like this would
happen here In the ocean

(off his look)
70 percent of the earths surface is
water Norman Thats first grade
geography

NORMAN
It never occurred to me

BETH
Well lets pray thats the only
mistake you made Have you said
anything to Barnes about this

NORMAN
The timing has never seemed quite
right

BETH
Just keep your mouth shut alright
This could mean everything to our
careers you know that Dont
jeopardize this

NORMAN
(nervous laughter)
What -- are you threatening me
EXT SHIP -- LATE AT NIGHT
THE SKY -- clouds looming on the horizon

ANGLE ON ARTHUR LEVINE leaning against the railing looking out

at
the water
ON NORMAN approaching him Arthur never looks at Norman he
just
stares out at the water
ARTHUR
I dont know you but Ill be honest
with you I dont like this I dont
like any of this Especially the
water
NORMAN
Seasick A marine biologist
ARTHUR
I dont belong here None of us
belong here Look at that
ANGLE ON THE WATER an ocean of seemingly endless choppy waves

INT DESCENT PLATFORM
A porthole hatch to the DESCENT SUB unlatches loudly A SUB-
OFFICER
help Norman lower himself through the hatch

INT DESCENT SUB

Norman steps down the ladder into the sub compartment Seated in
circle area Ted Beth Harry and Arthur Ahead of them
Captain

Barnes sits with the pilot in the subs cockpit separated by a
wall

of plexiglass

Norman takes a seat between Beth and Ted

BARNES (0S)
(through the intercom)
Our descent will take 13 minutes
Descending at a speed of 80 feet per
minute

Across from Norman Harry is WHISPERING something quietly into
Arthurs ear

BARNES (0S)
Pressure adjustments will cause the
sub to lurch at times but dont be
alarmed Its perfectly normal

Arthurs face drips with sweat as Harry continues to whisper
into his
ear

BARNES (0S)
The subs interior atmosphere will
experience moisture as we descend
and the temperature will drop
rapidly Just relax and remain
seated during the descent

Norman watches Arthur dripping with sweat

BARNES (0S)
We have clearing from the base

Red interior lights flicker on in the compartment and WE HEAR
the sub

make a HISSING sound The sub lurches and begins to lower in
the

water

NORMAN
Arthur

Harry has gotten to Arthur Arthur is on the verge of panic

NORMAN
Arthur You alright
ARTHUR
Open the hatch door please

Harry continues to whisper in his ear

ARTHUR
Captain open the hatch door please

please

BARNES (0S)
Calm down Dr Levine

ARTHUR
Let me out Captain Open the door

BARNES (0S)
Please Dr Levine

Arthur leaps violently out of his seat scrambles to the

plexiglass
wall
BARNES
(through the plexiglass)
Sit down Dr Levine Youre ina

military operation now --
Arthur bangs on the plexiglass wall with his fists

BARNES
Your civil rights have been
overridden

ARTHUR
Open it Captain

BARNES
Dr Levine please Return to your
seat

Arthur VOMITS violently heaving splattering the plexiglass
wall

ARTHUR
Open the fucking door

The sub LURCHES again coming to a stop The compartment is
totally

silent as they begin ascending to the surface

ON HARRY smiling a sly evil grin directed right at Norman
The sub lurches again and WE HEAR clanking metal The hatch
door
opens

And Arthur wiping the vomit from his mouth climbs up the ladder
and

out the hatch door

BARNES (0S)
Anybody else

Silence

The hatch door LOCKS loudly The sub lurches and begins
descending

TED
Pussy

BETH
Whats that -- mistake number two
Norman

NORMAN

He wasnt feeling well

TED
Hes a pussy

Harry is still staring at Norman

HARRY
How are you feeling Norman

down Thinks its a mistake

Norman looks over at Beth

HARRY
She told me what you said Norman

TED
What is it Harry

HARRY
Just one of Normans many secrets

ON NORMAN saying nothing

EXT OCEAN

WE SEE the sub descending into darker waters

EXT DH-8 HABITAT -- ARRIVING DOCK

The SUB descends into the AIRLOCK metal clanks against metal
Around

One moment for pressurizing

A SOFT WHIRR
ANGLE ON -- Barnes and the four remaining team members standing
in the

small claustrophobic pressurizing room Like sardines Nobody
says

anything A long beat

in front of them opens TEENY FLETCHER 30s a big-boned female
officer stands before them She wears a black plastic PAD a
talker around her neck

She hands each member their own talker Norman takes his
INT DH-8 HALLWAY

Fletcher leads Barnes and the team members down the hallway
Each of
them wears the talkers around their necks

BARNES
They pressurize us with helium

NORMAN
Whats wrong with oxygen

BARNES
Its a corrosive gas On earth it
makes a half-eaten apple turn brown
and puts the ugly iron rust on an
Oldsmobile At a pressure this low
oxygen becomes toxic Breathe it
down here and itll do to your dick
what it does to the Oldsmobile

TED
Important safety tip Thanks
Captain

Fletcher listens through her radio earpiece turns to Barnes

FLETCHER
Captain the divers have the airlock
mounted at the door The robot is
now in position to enter the
spacecraft

TED
Robot What robot

INT VIDEO FEED ROOM
CLOSE ON A MONITOR -- showing the robot in front of the curved
gray
metal of the spacecraft

BARNES
Edmunds bring up the robots camera
feed

JANE EDMUNDS 32 the unit archivist works the control panel
Another
MONITOR clicks on -- showing the robots POV of the door

TED
Captain you know I really
appreciate you hauling us a thousand
feet below sea level so we can watch
this historical event on television

BARNES
Nobody goes inside until we know
whats inside

ON THE MONITOR -- THE ROBOT CAMERA scans the spacecraft hull
stops on
a rectangular panel mounted to the left of the door

BARNES
Can you open that panel

EDMUNDS
Working on it now sir

ON THE MONITOR -- a robotic CLAW extends out to the panel
Trying to
pry the panel open

TED
Id like it noted in the report that
I think we should be doing this
ourselves Making a manned entry

The claw is clumsy and keeps banging into the metal

TED
Id also like it noted --

BARNES
Duly noted Ted Edmunds try using
suction
ON THE MONITOR -- another robotic arm extends out with a rubber

sucker It pushes against the panel but doesnt suck
EDMUNDS
Its not sucking sir

BARNES
Thank you I can see that Try
something else

EDMUNDS
We dont have anything else to try
Sir

BARNES
Well shit -- find something do
something make something up --

TED
What about a crowbar

Barnes straightens up looks at Ted

BARNES
What about a crowbar

TED
What if we go out there you know --
wedge a crowbar in the door and pry
the thing open

HARRY
Pry the thing open What are we --
neanderthals

BETH
All that banging and pounding I
dont know We should think about
making a good first impression

HARRY
For who The fish

BETH
For whoevers in that thing

BARNES
Or whatevers in that thing

ON THE MONITOR -- the spacecraft sitting there silently staring
back
at them

BARNES
Norman what do you think

Norman quiet in the corner perks up

NORMAN
Me Well -- I dont really I
mean you could you know you
could make a real solid case a
crowbar
All eyes on Norman
NORMAN

I dont know
A beat as they all stare at him

TED
Im secure enough with that

INT CHANGING ROOM

ANGLE ON A LOCKER door opening Inside is an elaborate JUMPSUIT

and
HELMET with the name JOHNSON stenciled above the faceplate
NORMAN
Are we all -- I mean is it
necessary for all of us to go out
there
The other team members take their suits out of their lockers
BARNES
Nothing to be nervous about These
suits are wired and electrically
heated Each equipped with an alarm
that triggers automatically if life-
support sustems go below optimum
Norman holds his jumpsuit out and away from him like its
something

nuclear

TED
Its just like swimming Norman
You know how to swim dont you

HARRY
Youre not afraid of the water are
you Norman
They all look over at him

BETH
(half smiling)
Isnt there a psychological term for
that Dr Johnson

NORMAN
(under his breath)
Yeah Drowning

INT AIRLOCK ROOM -- (A CYLINDER)

Dressed in jumpsuits and helmets -- Barnes jumps into a POOL of
ocean

water cut out from the floor leading to the ocean It looks
like a

tiny swimming pool Ted jumps in next Beth Harry and Norman
are

left

BETH
Youre next Norman

NORMAN
(nervous as hell)
No Go ahead Really Ladies first

BETH
Such a gentlemen when youre scared
shitless

She hops in Norman watches looks up at Harry next to him

HARRY

NORMAN
No why dont --

Harry nudges him forward

HARRY

Harry pushes him again Norman catches himself

NORMAN
Geez cmon alright Gimme a
minute Let me get my bearings --
Harry pushes him again

HARRY
Cmon Norman

NORMAN
Look would you --

And Harry just pushes him in Norman slips and falls
awkwardly into
the ocean depths

CUT TO

BLACK

Quiet Only THE SOUND OF NORMAN -- BREATHING

For a couple beats

Now NORMANS POV -- from inside his helmet -- a light SHINES
from

behind him -- casting his SHADOW onto the murky ocean floor

Normans head turns and hes BLINDED by a light -- its Harry
the

light SHINING from the top of Harrys helmet

WE HEAR Harrys voice static through Normans helmet

HARRY (0S)
The switch is on your waist

ON NORMAN -- his GLOVE -- fumbling at his waist

HIS HELMET LIGHT -- FLICKERS on

ON NORMAN -- slowly beginning to walk on the ocean floor

HIS FEET -- squashing gently lightly into the muddy ground

NORMANS POV -- can barely make out the others in front of him
their

helmet lights STROBING the dark water crossing each other like
searchlights on a foggy night

CLOSE ON NORMANS FACE -- eyes cold BREATHING Couple beats
And
HEARS
TED (0S)
Look at that thing

Normans eyes look up WE PULL BACK
LONG HIGH WIDE SHOT of the team -- their little helmet lights

tiny
and insignificant almost as

N FRONT OF THEM -- the SPACECRAFT Dwarfing them in size
looming
large majestic like nothing weve ever seen The enormous tail
fin
in the distance extends high out of the coral
n the huge MOUND OF CORAL covering the spacecraft WE SEE a
tunnel --
cut out like a cave -- lined with tiny dim lightbulbs

INT TUNNEL

About 60 feet deep Narrower than theyd like Norman descends

clumsily awkwardly -- pushing off the bulky iron handles
fastened to

the coral walls

THE LOUD HISSING OF AIR
INT SPACECRAFT AIRLOCK

CLOSE ON NORMANS FACE as he watches the water recede down past
his
faceplate

THE LOUD BANGING OF METAL

Ted has wedged a crowbar into the door and BANGS at it with a
sledgehammer

HARRY
Easy Ted were not mining gold

TED
Gimme some room here will you Back
off Gimme some space

They all back away cramming into the far corner of the airlock
as Ted
keeps swinging

BETH
Looks alot like an airplane door
beari

looks

doesnt it

Ted stops and looks at the door

TED
Alot like You know
before but I didnt

HARRY
Shutup Ted
Keep hammering

NORMAN
You want me to try

TED

Youre a 53 year old shrink

are you gonna do

BARNES
Give him the hammer

Norman takes the hammer

ngs

Rears back then stops

TED
What is it

Something has caught Normans eye

BARNES
What is it Norman

NORMAN
Take a look

Barnes comes toward him

Ted

Walks up to the wedge

The others follow

I noticed it

You didnt notice shit

what

Gets his

your back give out

He looks down at the wedge

Barnes bends down

closely down at the wedge in the door

BARNES
Its chipped

HARRY
Chipped The door

chipped

BARNES

How can it be

I dont know how it can be chipped

but its chipped
HARRY
I thought you said there wasnt any
damage done in the crash

BARNES
I did

HARRY
Then how can it be chipped

ON BETH -- she touches the door with her palms feels around

BETH
Theres heat coming the door

BARNES
Back away then

BETH
Wait a minute --

BARNES
I said back away

BETH
Would you wait a minute

THE DOOR STARTS TO RUMBLE

Barnes unstraps a GUN -- nearly the size of an uzzi -- from his
buckle

BARNES
Ted get her away from the door

TED
What are you going to do -- shoot
her
The RUMBLING louder
BARNES

Get her away
THE DOOR begins to slide open
Beth backs away
THE DOOR sliding is revealing COMPLETE BLACKNESS inside The
door

stops its open its quiet They all stand there looking at
BLACKNESS A long beat
INT SPACECRAFT

ON NORMAN -- cautiously stepping inside His helmet light SHINES
on the

others ahead of him walking along a 5 foot wide CATWALK
suspended

high in the air

Metallic BEAMS and RAFTERS criss-cross above them

Norman looks over the railing -- his light STROBES through 40
feet of

darkness dimly lighting the LOWER HULL a dense network of
STRUTS and

GIRDERS

TED
Look at this

BARNES
What is it

Ted SPOTLIGHTS the OUTER HULL

TED
Some sort of lead or something

BARNES
Radiation shield you think

TED
A foot and a half thick Thatd
withstand a helluva lot of
radiation

Beths light SHINES down onto the CATWALK WE SEE FOOTPRINTS
outlined
on the dusty floor

BETH
Hold on --

BARNES
What is it

BETH
Any of you get ahead of me -- walk
this far up

TED
No I dont think so
BETH
Well think Because theres
footprints here that arent mine

TED
Well theyre not mine

ON THE FOOTPRINTS -- large like the boots theyre wearing
BARNES
Calm down alright They gotta be

somebodys here Lets stay
together please

CUT TO

LONG SHOT -- seeing them suspended high in the air on the

catwalk

how

walking Their tiny streams of LIGHT moving about WE SEE just
ominous this spacecraft really is
BETH
Its empty Why would someone build a
ship like this

HARRY
Youd have to ask them

They approach a DOOR at the end of the catwalk

BARNES
Alright Beth do that thing you did
before

BETH

How about I just press the button
She presses a button near the door The door SLIDES open

BARNES
Or just press the button

Barnes holds out his gun and enters The others behind him

TED
Strange isnt it You know -- how
it would have a button

NORMAN
Earth doesnt have a patent on
buttons Ted

TED
Still make a note I recognized that

ON BARNES -- leading them through a small hall It seems to be
opening
up into some sort of room -- when Barnes stops Dead in his
tracks
TED

Whats wrong

BARNES
(serious)
What do you make of this

ON NORMAN -- as he steps around Barnes his light BRIGHTENING on
SIGN that reads Trash

TED
(softly)
What the hell

Very softly Harry begins to laugh

TED
English

HARRY
Thats right

Norman looks up and SEES more of the room as his light SHINES

throughout it TABLES COUCHES and CHAIRS -- made of leather
very

comfortable looking

They begin to slowly wander about

BETH
I dont get it

TED
It doesnt make any sense

HARRY
You dont think it does I think
its rather obvious

TED
Is it some sort of joke Like one of
those hoaxes

HARRY
A spacecraft half a mile long --
with 500 tonnes of coral on top of
it Someone went to a lot of
trouble Try again

TED
But its impossible

HARRY
Is it

Beth touches the table its metal but its soft and rubbery

TED
Why would this ship carry
instructions in English

HARRY
Think about it

TED
Unless this alien spacecraft was --
you know -- somehow presenting
itself to Americans in a way that
would make us feel comfortable

NORMAN
400 years ago Im sure Christopher
Columbus wouldve loved these
accomodations

BETH
Good theory Ted

TED
Well whats your theory

BETH
Im a woman I dont theorize I
only deal with facts

HARRY
All the facts you need are right in
front of you

TED
Gimme a minute here I think Ive
got it
ON NORMAN

HARRY
Do you

TED
If it is an alien spacecraft --

HARRY
Save your breath Its not an alien
spacecraft

BETH
Then what is it

HARRY
(beat)
ts an American spacecraft

TED

An American spacecraft Half a mile
long And buried 400 years Yeah
good theory Harry

HARRY
ts been obvious from the start
hasnt it Captain Thats why all
the secrecy why no one was told
about it

BARNES
We had considered it

TED
Considered what That its American
How would you think its American

HARRY
The chip in the door

-- glancing up at Harry

HARRY
We take a weeny little wedge bang
on it a couple of times and bust
off a chunk of the metal Yet any

spacecraft -- even at a low
velocity say 200 miles an hour --
crashes into the water -- its gonna

be like hitting concrete it would
crumple like paper But there isnt
a dent to be seen anywhere Not even
a scratch
TED
Meaning

HARRY
Meaning it didnt land in the water

TED
Please It must have flown here --

HARRY

What are you looking for

HARRY
A light switch A button opened that

of power

ON NORMAN -- as he sits down in one of the CHAIRS
BETH
Whats that noise

They LISTEN to a GIRGLING NOISE

NORMAN
Sounds a little like water --

SUDDENLY -- the chair Normans in -- wraps around him squeezing
him
inside padding sliding around his head his shoulders enveloping
him
-- sucking him inside
BETH

NORMAN
Get this thing off me
Beth bends down presses a button the CHAIR releases Norman
BETH
I think the chair thinks you want to
fly this thing

ON THE SCREEN -- as it expands in size widens around them

curving

like

WE SEE a galaxy of stars planets coming OFF THE SCREEN into the

illusion of depth

The IMAGE begins streaking outward TOWARD US moving rapidly

Our answer

NORMAN
To what

HARRY

The CLUSTER of stars grows brighter and brighter

closer
and closer brightening

as it comes

The FIELD twists and turns as the SCREEN and FIELD become

BLINDING as

BARNES (0S)
Yes Harry

HARRY (0S)
We know how this craft got here
Where its been

BARNES (0S)
So do we And it seems to have
picked up something on its travels

STILL ON NORMAN -- frightened

NORMAN
Picked up something What is it

BARNES (0S)
I dont know But its something
alien

INT CARGO BAY

ANGLE ON our six team members BOOTS in the distance

UP

CUT TO

AS WE PAN
in

and AROUND WE SEE a curved surface appear

swirling green and blue fluids Like mercury

a surface of slowly

Mesmerizing

AS WE COME AROUND the team stands looking at the SPHERE 30 feet

dlameter held by a GIANT CLAW gripping it from the top

They walk around it circling it looking up at it

HARRY

NORMAN

HARRY

This answers one of our questions

Which one Let me get the list out

This spacecraft was designed to pick
things up They see things they want
-- these claws go out and bring it
in They come across this This
sphere Find it interesting

curious They draw it inside to take

back home

NORMAN

But on the way home they miss their
turn go too far into the past

HARRY
Our present

BARNES

But what does it do This sphere

TED

Maybe its a message of some sort
you know See this red here

ANGLE ON THE SPHERE -- some dark red MARKINGS on its surface

TED
(continuing)
Looks like a design some
maybe Maybe it was sent

spacecraft with a message

HARRY
Look closely That isnt
Those are grooves

ON THE RED GROOVES -- engraved into

writing
to meet the

writing

the surface
HARRY
No They dont represent a message
They arent decorative at all They
have another purpose entirely

BARNES
What

HARRY
To conceal a small break in the
surface of the sphere

BARNES
A break for what

INT HABITAT -- HALLWAY

DOWN A LONG CORRIDOR -- WE SEE Barnes through a half-closed
door

pacing talking on the phone

BARNES
its definitely something alien
another civilization yes sir
Well we dont know yet but we
think weve found a door

INT VIDEO FEED ROOM

Edmunds Barnes and the team members (minus Ted) look at the
monitor

BARNES
So how do we get it open

HARRY
Ted seems to have some ideas

ON THE MONITOR -- Ted pushing on the SPHERE door Banging into
it with
his shoulder

NORMAN
Maybe we shouldnt

BARNES
What

NORMAN
If it is alien maybe we shouldnt
try to open it at all
HARRY
(nodding to Norman)
Man is man all he knows is man and
all he can think of is what he
knows The anthropomorphic problem
Good Norman

BARNES
The what

NORMAN
I mentioned it in my report Didnt
you read the report

HARRY
Everything ever written about extra-
terrestial life imagines that life
is essentially human If it doesnt
look human its a reptile or a big
insect or something having human
values human understanding

BARNES
So Whats the problem

HARRY
Its nonsense Theres enough
difference between our own species
to prove that

BETH
Take politics our views on
abortion the death penalty

HARRY
Cannibalism to be extreme And now
were talking about a new life form
Their values and ethics may be
incomprehensible

BARNES
Like Thou shall not kill

NORMAN
Or maybe it cant be killed

BARNES
You mean whats in that thing is
immortal

NORMAN
I dont know Thats the point
BARNES
Everything can be killed

BETH
Not everything Even on earth Take
yeasts

BARNES
Yeasts Thank you Beth but I dont
think were gonna open it up and
find a loaf of bread

HARRY
And were just talking about three-
dimensional creatures What if its
five or six or seven-dimensional So
dimensional that we couldnt even
see it to kill it

NORMAN
Good point I dont know what youre
talking about but good point

BARNES
Or it could contain some great
benefit to us some astonishing new
idea or technology to help mankind

HARRY
It could But the odds of it being
any use to us are against it

BARNES
You dont know that

HARRY
Lets say whoever made this thing is
a thousand years ahead of us just
like we are to say medieval
Europe Suppose you went back to
medieval Europe with a TV set There
wouldnt be any place to plug it in

BARNES
Just tell me worst case Worst case
of what we might find

BETH
It could breathe in air and exhale
cyanide gas
NORMAN
Disrupt our brain waves interfere
with our ability to think

HARRY
Produce radioactive waste and
disintegrate us into nothing

Norman is lying in his own bunk below Harry

NORMAN
Dont be so optomistic Harry

HARRY
Im completely serious There is
something very important missing
from that spacecraft You know what
that is

NORMAN
Not a clue

HARRY
A sign that the builders knew time
travel through a black hole was
possible

NORMAN
I dont follow you

HARRY
On that flight recorder they called
the black hole an Unknown Entry
Event They didnt know what a
black hole was Fifty years from
now men are going to build that
ship in a very tentative
experimental way with no knowledge
that time travel through a black
hole is possible

NORMAN
So what

Harry leans his head over his bunk

HARRY
So we know
(beat)
We know it went through a black
hole We saw it Norman -- when wed

get to the surface wed tell

someone about the black hole
wouldnt we Itd go in some report
like some big discovery So in fifty
years when they build that ship
theyd make precautions for a black
hole

(beat)

But they didnt The called it an
Unknown Entry Event

NORMAN
Meaning were never gonna get the
chance to tell anyone

HARRY
Meaning were never gonna get to the
surface alive to tell anyone

Norman gets out of his bed

NORMAN
I cant believe that Harry

HARRY
Gimme another explanation

NORMAN
I cant If I had a minute to think
maybe but I know youre wrong

HARRY
Am I
NORMAN
Look -- were under a lot of

pressure were tired youre not
thinking straight

HARRY
You mean you think Im cracking

NORMAN
No I didnt say that

HARRY
Then what Norman

Norman stops pacing a beat

When was this

NORMAN
81 I think She tried again five
years ago
(beat)
I thought you should know

BARNES
So you knew this when you wrote your
report

NORMAN
At the time I dont know I thought
putting her on the list -- it might
help her career -- catch her a
break

BARNES

You knowingly recommended a woman
with suicidal tendencies fora
government operation --

NORMAN
Wait a second --

BARNES
-- and then brought her down here --

NORMAN
-- I didnt know it would come to
this --

BARNES

-- without a cautionary word to
anyone

earlier I think hes right He
said When you got a guy who -- if
he wasnt here -- hed be standing
in the unemployment line you gotta
question if you got the right guy

HARRY
Its the same as before but the
spacings different now Its
definitely nonrandom See

Harry sitting at the monitor shows Ted Barnes Norman and
Edmunds a
PRINTOUT of the screan -- indicating a pattern

HARRY
Its a single sequence repeated over
and over

BARNES
Were all very proud of you Harry
but what the hell is it

TED
Maybe its a message

EDMUNDS
From what

TED
The sphere Maybe the sphere --

EDMUNDS
Were not hooked up to the sphere

HARRY
Well if its a discharge --

TED
Its not a discharge Right
Edmunds You said before right So
its gotta be a message

BARNES
From the sphere

TED
Whats inside the sphere

HARRY
If it is a message its probably a
substitution code Ill work on it

TED
Yeah Ill work on it too
BARNES
(to Ted flat)
You do that

INT BATHROOMSHOWER AREA

Ted nervous anxious -- with five or six printouts in his hand -
- has
Normans ear in front of the sink

TED
Hes manic Norman You know that
This reliance on Harry is misplaced
You hear me Totally misplaced Hes
overlooking things Obvious things

NORMAN
Like what

Ted hands him a printout

TED
Its not some fucking substitution
code its a direct visual
representation

NORMAN
You mean a picture

TED
Take a look I rearranged the
numbers Put em up to the light
(Norman does)
Go ahead Squint at it

NORMAN
I dont see anything

TED
Squint harder

NORMAN
Please Ted

TED

(hands him another
printout)
Try this one

NORMAN
This is like nursery school
ON NORMAN

TED
Dont you see it Its a picture of
the creature

NORMAN
The creature

TED
Inside the sphere Look thats the
vertical torso three legs two
arms Theres no head so Im
guessing the creatures head is
located within the torso itself you
know

-- Teds lost it

NORMAN
Well how about we wait and see what
Harry comes up with

TED
Sure why not Give him the trophy
That pretentious son of a bitch You
heard him Norman All that someone
went to a lot of trouble try again
bullshit And impotent Where does
he get off saying Im impotent Hes
a fucking self-righteous little
prick

CLOSE ON MONITOR -- spirals now

HARRY
I asked myself why would the
sphere be using a code If youre
trying to communicate why use a
code

TED
(to Norman)
See No code Whatd I say

HARRY
Codes are for hiding information So
its making a mistake Its making a

code without intending to I figured
its probably substituting numbers

for letters Then I began to wonder
what an alien intelligence would

CUT TO
make of our keyboard And since
were getting spirals I imagined
the keyboard as a spiral Sol
translated it

NORMAN
Thats brilliant

Ted grimaces at Norman

HARRY
spiralling out of the center you
see G is one B is two H is
three and so on when I got the
message

BARNES
Whats the message

HARRY
I have to tell you Its strange

BARNES
How do you mean strange

Harry picks up his yellow pad of paper and reads

HARRY
Hello How are you I am fine What
is your name My name is Jerry

BARNES

He translated it wrong My name is

intelligence Its smart Its

approaching us in a simple way Like
you would a dog Holding out your
hand letting it sniff get used to
you

BARNES

But sir I think its imperative I
think the messages the animals
weve seen what killed Edmunds the
reading you got earlier -- I think
theyre all related

TED
Jerry isnt hostile Norman He said
earlier -- we were his friends --

NORMAN
Of course he did Hes been isloated
for 400 years He wants someone to
talk to Look you put a human being
in isolation for four days they can
become neurotic sometimes
psychotic Were talking about 400
years here An alien that shows

emotional responses I think we need
to address him before he reacts
further

BARNES

You think he killed Edmunds

NORMAN
Yes I do Whatevers out there I
think is his response to us refusing
to talk to him earlier

BARNES
Bullshit Whats out there isnt
alien Its an animal

NORMAN

Maybe so But I think we need to ask
Jerry about it

No I think we should shut down the
communication lines inside the

NORMAN (0S)
Remember when we first spoke to
Jerry Barnes kept asking for
Jerrys real name But Harry never
would He didnt because he was
afraid the screen would say Harry
instead of Jerry We werent talking
to an alien intelligence when we
talked to Jerry we were talking to
Harry or a part of Harry

BETH (0S)
What do you mean a part of Harry

BACK IN -- CONTROL ROOM

NORMAN
When did the messages start The
animals outside start showing up
After Harry came out of the sphere

BETH
You think in the sphere --

NORMAN
He acquired some sort of power A
power to manifest things
BETH
But how

NORMAN
I dont know

BETH
How can the sphere do that

NORMAN
I dont know Beth Im not the
fucking alien that built the thing
But it can When Harry came out of
the sphere he mumbled something
about page 87 How he would never
read that far -- he was too scared
to Then you found the book
remember in your lab Then in the
cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about
a giant squid

BETH
Which I told Barnes was attacking --

NORMAN
Its his fear The squid Hes
manifesting his fears Making them
real

BETH
But why is he doing it

NORMAN
He must not realize he is Like the
Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping

then He mustve manifested his
dream

BETH
His dream You cant control your
dreams And you cant control your
fears can you

Bad joke Sorry Beth

NORMAN
The power allows us to manifest our
fears right What if we feared the
power to go away

You mean forget

NORMAN
It would erase all our knowledge of
it All of our power

BETH
Would it work

NORMAN
Yes And I think we already know it
will

BETH

Hows that

NORMAN
Down below Harry said we would all
have to die Since there was no
evidence on that spacecraft that
anybody knew time travel through a
black hole was possible -- and we
all knew -- then we would all have
to die before we could tell anyone

Death was the only logical

explanation But sitting here we
still know So how is that possible
