SUBTITLE FADES IN SAN FRANCISCO PRIDE MARCH

A beautiful clear day Market Street is absolutely rammed
full of spectators and revelers as the annual Pride March
slowly moves along

ALICE (30s sporting hot pants and a rainbow t-shirt)
stands on the sidewalk with BECKY (30’s wearing shorts and
a crop top)

ALICE
This is insane How the hell are we
supposed to spot Glenn’s group
amongst all these marchers

BECKY
Just relax will you Get your happy
face on and enjoy the day

Alice frowns at Becky Suddenly out of the corner of her
eye Alice spots something small scampering away behind
them She steps back from the edge of the street anda
stunned look crosses over her face as she spies the small
scamperer

ALICE
No way Becky

A puzzled Becky turns around and finds her friend pointing
aimlessly down the street

BECKY
Alice you get back here now

ALICE
Becky

Becky pissed off shoves some spectators out of the road
and joins her friend

ALICE (CONTD)
Look Danny De

BECKY
Danny De-Fucking-Vito

Becky grabs Alice’s hand and drags her friend down the
street in DANNY DEVITO’S direction

BECKY (CONTD )
Come on screw Glenn Imagine a
selfie with the guy from Junior
ALICE
Let’s fucking do it

The girls squeal exchange high fives and give chase after
the diminutive superstar

As they close in on their target the sound of their shoes
startle Danny DeVito up ahead and he turns and locks eyes
with the girls They stand there for a moment glee etched
across the girls’ faces fear on Danny’s

Suddenly Danny DeVito turns and legs it down an alleyway
The girls give chase

As they turn into the alleyway they find it’s a dead end
and Danny DeVito is trapped up ahead

BECKY
Mr DeVito We’re such huge

DANNY DEVITO
Right you caught me You just had
to fucking catch me didn’t you

ALICE
All we want is

DANNY DEVITO
My pot of gold yep I get it

ALICE (CONTD)
Pot of what

BECKY
We just want a quick selfie I
loved you in Junior it’s my
favorite film ever

DANNY DEVITO
Well that right there is bullshit
it’s no one’s favorite film Let’s
just go through the traditional
shit

The girls exchange puzzled looks Danny DeVito toddles over
to a wooden crate and takes a seat

DANNY DEVITO (CONTD )
You get three wishes not each
between you Now shoot
ALICE
We really just want a selfie with
the guy from Junior We watch it
every weekend for our post-party
chilldown session

DANNY DEVITO
No three wishes you sure

BECKY
What are you a genie

DANNY DEVITO
Did you see me jump out of a
fucking lamp No dipshit I’ma
bloody leprechaun

Danny DeVito eyeballs the confused girls angrily he turns
and spits on the ground in front of them

DANNY DEVITO (CONTD )
Right if you’re not taking my
wishes I guess we’re going after
the gold Come on let’s get this
over with

Danny DeVito jumps from the crate and heads back towards
Market street

ALICE
Where are you going

DANNY DEVITO
Where do leprechaun’s keep their
gold

The girls return two blank faces

DANNY DEVITO (CONTD )
At the end of the fucking rainbow

BECKY
Ah rainbow colors pride march

DANNY DEVITO
Youre obviously the smart one

Danny DeVito scampers away towards the main parade the
girls follow

END OF MONTAGE

EXT CORONA HEIGHTS PARK - DAY

As the Pride March tails off in the background Danny DeVito
leads the girls into an area of the park that’s covered in
bushes They wonder into a clearing where he stops at a
certain bush

DANNY DEVITO
Right here we go

BECKY
Here we go what

DANNY DEVITO
The gold My leprechaun gold it’s
buried under this bush

ALICE
Ah Id nearly forgotten that bit

DANNY DEVITO
Got a shovel

ALICE (CONTD )
Er
DANNY DEVITO
Well if you ain’t got a shovel
you ain’t gonna be digging up the
gold are you

BECKY
There was a hardware store a block
back we can run over there and get
one

ALICE
Good thinking But how are we going
to tell which bush it is when we
get back

DANNY DEVITO
Why don’t you take off one of your
bright red socks and tie it around
the bush

BECKY
Hang on I remember this tale We
tie it around the bush and by the
time we get back he’s gone and tied
a load of other socks around the
other bushes

DANNY DEVITO
You are the brainy one

Alice aims a frown in Danny’s direction

BECKY
I‘ll keep him here while you go to
the store

ALICE
Perfect Right no tricks little
guy you be nice

DANNY DEVITO
To be sure

Alice gives Becky a fist pump and the girls let out an
excited squeal Danny DeVito grimaces and parks his rear
end on the ground as Alice runs off to the shop
INT HARDWARE STORE - DAY

As a CHECKOUT BOY (20’s wearing a blue baseball cap and
store apron) runs the shovel through the scanner Alice runs
her mouth

ALICE
Seriously Danny De-fucking-Vito

CHECKOUT BOY
Very good miss

ALICE
He’s a lot smaller in real life
than you’d think but he’s so damn
cute and cuddly

CHECKOUT BOY
That’ll be 1299 please

Alice rakes around in her pocket and presents some notes
and the Checkout Boy returns her change

ALICE
Best day ever and now you’re part
of it too

CHECKOUT BOY
You think

ALICE
Damn straight

Alice leans across the counter and gives the startled young
man a peck on the cheek As she runs out of the store the
Checkout Boy offers a sheepish wave goodbye

EXT CORONA HEIGHTS PARK - DAY

Alice sprints up a hill towards where she left the Becky and
Danny As she gets to the top she finds the bushes but
Danny DeVito and Becky are nowhere to be seen

ALICE
(shouting)
Becky Danny

Nothing but silence

ALICE (CONTD )
Come on guys don’t play around
Suddenly the silence is broken by a muffled squeal coming
from an area beside a large tree Alice with trepidation
walks over to the tree

ALICE (CONTD )
Becky Seriously you’re starting
to freak me out where are you

As Alice nears the muffled noises she finds a freshly dug
hole She stops in her tracks Danny DeVito walks out from
behind the tree

DANNY DEVITO
Well we found a shovel

ALICE
Where’s Becky and what are you
doing off the leash

DANNY DEVITO
Why don’t you take a look down the
hole We had a little bit of fun
while you were away

Alice slowly walks to the side of the hole and finds Becky
tied up in Danny’s leash and with a red sock crammed into
her mouth

ALICE
Becky What the fuck did you do
you little creep

DANNY DEVITO
Woah woah woah You just paraded
me a proud Leprechaun around San
Francisco city centre for an
afternoon attached to a leash
What the fuck did you do

ALICE
You get her out of that hole now or
I swear to god

Alice raises the shovel up over Danny DeVito’s head

DANNY DEVITO
I wouldn’t do that if I were you

ALICE
That’s fucking it
Alice starts to bring the shovel down towards Danny
Suddenly there’s a rustle in the tree above and BANG
FRANKIE MUNIZ drops from a branch above and smashes a
shovel down on Alice’s head

Alice sways for a moment before losing consciousness and
collapsing into the open pit

DANNY DEVITO
I forgot to introduce you to my
other leprechaun friend Frankie

FRANKIE MUNIZ
Top of fucking the morning to you

Frankie and Danny walk to the edge of the hole and take a
look at Becky now wide eyed with fear and the unconscious
Alice collapsed on top of her

FRANKIE MUNIZ
Shall we get this over with

DANNY DEVITO
To be sure I’ve got a date with a
pint of Guinness down Johnny
Foleys

Danny grabs Alice’s shovel and joins Frankie beside the
pit With Becky’s muffled wails as their soundtrack they
look at each other exchange a nod and start to fill up the
hole

FADE OUT
