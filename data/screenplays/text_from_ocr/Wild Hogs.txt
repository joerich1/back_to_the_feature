We see DOUG MATTHEWS 40s sitting across the table
staring at his son Billy Doug is handsome in that
honest sincere way A guy you would call to help you
move a couch He watches Billy scoop up his hashbrowns
with a frosted pop-tart Billy catches his Dads look
and grins with his mouth full Doug smiles back then
looks down at his own plate He has scrambled egg whites
and sliced tomatoes His smile fades away

MATTHEWS Shes attractive with a patient smile

beautiful model (CLAUDIA) as well as some pictures of
his wedding day with her their exotic vacations and one
blownup glamour shot of Woody shirtless oiled and
holding a greasy wrench
WOODY (CONTD)

was the last time you sang a Bon Jovi
song

DOUG

KELLY
You used to sing Bon Jovi songs at the
top of your lungs Like you didnt care
who heard you or how dopey it sounded
Then one day you just stopped Thats

how its been with everything Romance
sense of humor the way you used to give
me that cocky little wink when you took

off your shirt Its all faded away

leaving just a shell of what you used to

be Why Why no more Bon Jovi songs
DOUG
I dont know Theres just a lot

weighing me down these days you know

KELLY
Like what You have a great career a

perfect family Money is fine The only

thing that could be weighing you down is

me Is it me Are you tired of me

DOUG

TIRED OF--
Doug stops himself as it dawns on him You can see the
horror of realization creep across his face He looks at
Kelly wide-eyed

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 27
DOUG (CONTD)

(REALIZING)

Dudley

DOUG

DISSOLVE TO
EXT STREET - THE NEXT WEEK

DOUG is riding his Harley which is loaded with gear
(sleeping bag spare gas tank saddle bags) He
approaches a freeway entrance ramp where WOODY and
DUDLEY and BOB are waiting on their bikes next to an
entrance ramp sign that reads US Highway 50 The guys
all tap fists then notice Dudley is grinning ear to ear

WOODY

(TO DUDLEY)
What Whats wrong with you

DUDLEY
I got a tat

BOB
A tattoo You got a tattoo

DUDLEY
Im a biker dude I got a tat
Dudley yanks his jacket down to his elbows and we see he
is wearing a sleeveless shirt underneath On his bicep
is a tattoo of the Macintosh Apple The guys nod trying
to look impressed

DOUG
Wow Thats

DUDLEY
Trademarked I know But what are they
going to do Its in my skin bitch
Dudley laughs and pulls on his jacket as Woody ties a
bandana skull-cap on his head The guys look at Woody

DOUG
Youre not wearing a helmet

WOODY
Nape I dont want anything between me
and the road man

DOUG
You will if your head falls on it

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 30
Woody shrugs and starts his bike

WOODY
Look the only rule on this trip is to
have no plan Were riding to San
Francisco and nothing else is planned
Just riding free

DOUG
Well if were going to make it in five
days well should probably get to
Illinois by tonight

BOB
Yeah the way I mapped it out - we should
be a hundred miles past St Louis by
sundown

WOODY
What No No plan Its the open road
Who knows where well be

DOUG
I do I have this little GPS system
Doug shows them a handheld GPS system Woody grabs it
and throws it into a storm drain

DOUG (CONTD)
Hey What the hell man That was
expensive
WOODY
I did it for the good of the trip Doug
You dont need GPS to discover America
We just need the wind our bikes and
freedom And if we have an emergency I
always have a cell phone--
Woody takes out a cellphone Doug grabs it and throws it
in the storm drain

DOUG
Hah Hows that feel
Woody gives Doug a long look then slowly smiles

WOODY
It felt good It felt damn good

(ANNOUNCES)
No cell phones

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 31
DOUG

(WORRIED)
What

BOB
Hes right Doug Wild Hogs
Bob takes his cellphone and throws it in the storm drain

DOUG

(TO BOB)
You just did that so Karen wouldnt call

BOB
Yup
Bob starts his bike

DOUG
So were not even going to talk about
this I mean shouldnt we at least--

DUDLEY
Yeeeeaaah Freedom

Dudley throws his cellphone but instead of going into
the storm drain it goes flying into traffic and smashes
against an oncoming pickup truck We hear the truck
screech to a stop after it passes them

DOUG

(QUICKLY)
Okay lets ride
The guys all hastily start their bikes and take off up
the freeway ramp We hear the truck driver screaming
profanities as they guiltily ride away

CUT TO
EXT HIGHWAY US 50 - LATER THAT DAY

MUSIC CUE BLUE OYSTER CULTs (DONT FEAR) THE REAPER
The four guys ride along the highway through the hills
of Indiana smiling and nodding to each other Its the
Easy Rider moment The camera ROTATES AROUND and PULLS
OVERHEAD Its beautiful country and the guys are in
heaven Dudley wears a clunky helmet from the eighties
as well as World War II motorcycle goggles

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 32

A family in a station wagon pulls up to next to them
Two kids press their faces against the windows looking
at the bikers in awe Bob looks over at the kids in his
mirrored sunglasses and gives them a badass nod The
kids are amazed Bob looks to Doug Doug grins They
love this Bob gives a signal to the other guys and guns
his engine The others nod gun their engines and speed
away from the station wagon The kids watch with their
mouths open

EXT HIGHWAY US 50 - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

The guys are cruising along as before but now we see the
sky has gotten very cloudy and overcast

SFX THUNDER CRACK
The guys look up at the sky apprehensively
EXT HIGHWAY US 50 - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Its now pouring rain The guys ride along in misery
getting soaked After a moment the station wagon from
before pulls back up to them The kids are still pressed
against the window staring at the drenched bikers Bob
looks over and tries to give them another cocky nod - but
now its just embarrassing

END MUSIC CUE
EXT ROADSIDE US-50 - THAT EVENING

The sun has gone down and the guys have found a deserted
area off the highway to set up camp DOUG WOODY and BOB
lounge by a fire - with a tent set up behind them Doug
is roasting marshmallows and Bob is straining to blow up
an air mattress

DOUG

(TO BOB)
Why didnt you just bring a sleeping bag
like us

BOB

This is more comfortable

(blows a breath into it)

I wish Karen would have let me buy the
foot pump though

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 33
Bob continues to inflate the mattress as Dudley
approaches with a knotted plastic grocery bag

DUDLEY
This is poop Dont eat it
Dudley sets the bag aside and has a seat by the fire

DOUG
Dudley Youre supposed to bury that

WOODY
Yes Go bury it
DUDLEY
Its in a plastic bag I cant put that
in the earth Ill find a trash bin
tomorrow
The guys shake their heads and look back into the fire
After a moment Doug smiles

DOUG
This is really nice you know Chilling
by the fire with your best friends Just
relaxing and enjoying--

WOODY

(TO DUDLEY)
Im sorry Dudley you have to get rid
of that bag or Im going to vomit in your
lap

DOUG
--each others company
Dudley grabs the bag and heads off

DUDLEY
Fine Ill just hang it on a tree

WOODY
(yells after him)
Dont hang it on a tree

DOUG
Yup These are the times well

After a minute Doug turns to Woody and Bob

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 34

DOUG (CONTD)

WOODY
Old Doug Youve lost your Dad

DOUG

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 35

Dudley comes up and sits back down

DUDLEY

WOODY

afraid theyll kill him in his sleep

DUDLEY

BOB

You know its not always so bad Like
when Karen sleeps she still crawls over
and pushes up against me Just snuggles
right up like she needs me I like that

(then sobering)

Then the sun comes up and turns her into
a raging she-demon

DOUG
Yeah I guess life just isnt as simple
as it was when we were in college Well
except for you Woody Youre still
living the fairy tale Swimsuit model
wife Big job at an investment firm
Youve got the good life
Woody doesnt respond He just stares vacantly into the
fire for a beat

WOODY

(FLATLY)
Yeah The good life Im a lucky man

DUDLEY
My life blows I dont have a family
Or a wife I have a cat that doesnt

Doug pulls a flaming marshmallow out of the fire

DOUG (CONTD)
All right who wants their marshmallow
well-done
The guys just look at it

DOUG (CONTD)
Yeah I left that one on too long
Doug flips the stick and the marshmallow goes flying
behind him The guys dont notice - but we see the
marshmallow land on the tent and continue to burn Bob
continues to huff on the air mattress He stops and
looks at it

BOB
(out of breath)
I think Im half way there

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 37

WOODY
In just one hour

DOUG

(TO BOB)
You sure you dont want us to spread out

Doug turns around and sees a foot-wide flame now burning
on the tent

DOUG (CONTD)
Shit The tent--
Doug and the guys jump up and hurry over to the tent

DOUG (CONTD)
Dudley get the water jug off my bike
Dudley hurries over to Dougs bike as Doug and Bob try to
smother the flame with sand

DOUG (CONTD)
It should be okay Its fire retardant
The guys try and extinguish the flame as Dudley comes
running with a jug He quickly takes off the cap Doug
notices him

DOUG (CONTD)
Dudley no Thats—
Its too late Dudley is already throwing it on the
fire The liquid hits the tent and it explodes into
flames The guys shield themselves

DOUG (CONTD)
Gas Thats the spare gas tank Dudley
Dudley doesnt know what to say The fire quickly
disentergrates the tent Doug Bob and Woody just watch
knowing theres nothing they can do After a moment
DUDLEY runs back up with the correct water jug and
empties it on what is now a flaming pile of ash It does
nothing

DUDLEY
We need more water

DOUG
That was all of it Dudley That was all
the water we had

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 38

DUDLEY
Oh
Dudley takes this in for a moment

DUDLEY (CONTD)
Is anybody else thirsty
The guys just look at him

DISSOLVE TO
EXT ROADSIDE US-50 -- THE NEXT MORNING

BOB DOUG WOODY and DUDLEY are all sleeping on Bobs air
mattress like four sardines Doug opens his eyes to see
a large figure standing at the foot of the air mattress
Its a stern-looking highway patrolman

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
You guys all right

DOUG
Yeah Yeah just on a road trip
HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
All right Just making sure

(BEAT)
Looks pretty comfortable actually
We see the highway patrolman has started rubbing his
thigh Doug quickly jumps up waking the others

DOUG
Okay well Thanks for stopping Have

The highway patrolman laughs

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN

(WINKS)
Fives a crowd

moment

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (CONTD)

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 39
DUDLEY

(OBLIVIOUS)

Dudley gets up and puts his arm around Doug We see hes
wearing a saggy pair of briefs and nothing else

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Well Have a good one
The patrolman walks off Dudley looks at Doug and grins

DUDLEY

DOUG
Please put your pants on
EXT HIGHWAY US 50 - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

The guys cruise through the rolling prairies of Missouri
Its another beautiful day They ride in formation

until Woodys bandana doo-rag blows off Woody goes back
to get it The other guys stop and wait for him to
return

EXT HIGHWAY US 50 - LATER

The guys are still riding - but now the heat of the
Missouri plains is taking its toll They look boiling
and have sweated through their clothes Bob takes a
drink of water from a bottle of water then pours the
water over his head He breathes a sigh of relief until
he hears an angry yell behind him He looks back and
sees Woody is now drenched from the water Bob smiles
sheepishly as Woody burns

EXT HIGHWAY US 50 - LATER THAT DAY

The guys ride through the forested Ozark uplands looking
even hotter than before Doug spots a waterfall pouring
into a crystal clear spring and points to it The guys
nod in agreement

BOB

The guys look up to see that Bob is naked He smiles and
cannonballs into the water

BOB (CONTD)

Doug smiles and throws his shorts on the shore Dudley
smiles takes off his briefs and holds them up

DUDLEY
I will Do what Doug does
Dudley throws the briefs to shore They all look at
Woody He rolls his eyes and takes off his boxers

WOODY
I will be naked with my gay friends and
if they look at my jock I will kill
them
Woody throws the boxers to shore The guys all look at
each other and smile Its a nice moment
Until a family approaches
Doug looks at the other guys wide-eyed as a family with
three young kids walks up with a picnic basket The
young kids run and jump into the water The Dad of the
family laughs and shakes his head

FAMILY DAD
Hope you guys dont mind a little
company The mini-van was getting a

LITTLE--
The Dad stops talking as he sees into the water He
realizes then looks at his kids concerned

DOUG
Um Well were just taking a dip I

UH--

WOODY
Theres a shallower spring up the path
The kids might like that even more

The Mom lays down a blanket and turns to the guys The
Dad is still staring not sure what to do

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 42
FAMILY MOM

(TO WOODY)
Oh no These little squirts like to
DIVE AND--
The Mom sees a glimmer of something through the water
and realizes She suddenly looks very uncomfortable

FAMILY MOM (CONTD)

(VERY TENSE)
Janey Kyle Holland Out of the water
Were going to find a new spot

JANEY
No Mama This place has little rocks

THAT--

FAMILY MOM
Get out of the damn water Now

with them down the path After a moment of awkward
silence Doug looks at the guys

DOUG
We should go

BOB
You think Theyre gone now

WOODY
Yeah we could stay another few--

VOICE (0C)

Whhheeeeew

The guys look to the other side of the spring to see the

EXT HIGHWAY US 50 - LATE THAT AFTERNOON

The guys are back on their bikes cruising along the
wheat fields of Kansas Theyre looking tired once
again but suddenly Doug smiles

On the horizon a bar comes into view Out front are
several rows of Harley Davidsons Doug points it out to
the guys and they all smile Its like an oasis

The pull into the parking lot and climb off their bikes
Bob immediately falls to the ground

BOB
Dammit Legs asleep
The guys go to help Bob up as Dudley gets off his bike
and falls to the ground

DUDLEY
Me too

DOUG
You guys have to shift every once in
awhile Blood has to circulate
A MOMENT LATER Dudley and Bob are up and wiggling their
sleeping limbs as Woody looks up at the bar

WOODY
Now this is the best part of any road
trip Seeing our brothers on wheels
Look at this place America
The guys look at it and nod It is a cool looking shack
of a bar Doug admires the row of motorcycles out front

DOUG
Look at these bikes Theyre all
classics

BOB

Oh man Check it out A 1951 Panhead
You know how rare this thing is
The guys all crowd around the bike

DOUG
Yeah but why didnt he customize it
You have a 51 panhead and you dont
chrome out the exhaust Or airbrush an
eagle on the gas tank What a waste
Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 44

WOODY
Probably no good custom stores out here
in hick-land Well leave em a catalog
The guys push open the door and step into the bar

INT BIKER BAR - CONTINUOUS

The bar is full of bikers but not the kind we saw
before These guys are greasy tattooed and menacing

We see their jackets say Hells Angels The bikers turn
and stare at WOODY DOUG BOB and DUDLEY

DOUG

(TO BIKERS)
Hows it going

BOB
Hells Angels huh You guys are legends
Im surprised weve never seen you in
Daytona
The bikers kind of chuckle to themselves The leader of
the gang JACK steps forward Hes in his late 40s -
and looks like he could break you into bite size pieces

JACK
Yeah how do we keep missing that
The bikers all laugh Doug and the guys join in though
they dont quite get whats so funny

JACK (CONTD)
So you re Wild Hogs huh Thats your

gang

DOUG
Well not a gang Just friends Friends

back for the exit
DUDLEY

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 45

DUDLEY (CONTD)
Were all successful professionals in

Dudley spins around and shows them the back of his
jacket

JACK
Wow Thats great Can I try that on

DUDLEY

Dudley whips his jacket off and hands it to Jack who
pulls it on his massive frame He shows it to the gang
who laugh again Dudley does too

DUDLEY (CONTD)
So whos 51 panhead is that Sweet

(IGNORING DOUG)

DUDLEY
Seriously Youre serious

DOUG

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 46

DUDLEY

DOUG
DUDLEY--

DUDLEY
Hey I dont care what you say I ride a
panhead now Im better than you

JACK
Come on Dud Lets go see how you look

Jack smiles and leads Dudley outside Doug Bob and
Woody share an uncertain look

WOODY
Anybody else got that pre-rape feeling

EXT BIKER BAR - CONTINUOUS

Everyone is standing out front Dudley starts to get on
the classic motorcycle Jack stops him

JACK
Oh no no Thats Oilcans ride My
51 panhead is right over there
Jack points to a pile of abandoned rusty motorcycles
Among it is the junked carcass of a 51 panhead next to
an old rusty sidecar Dudley looks confused

DUDLEY
That Thats a piece of junk

JACK
Yup Your piece of junk
Woody Doug and Bob look at each other This isnt good
Doug tries to laugh it off

DOUG
All right guys We get the joke Good

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 47

JACK
Oh its no joke You want to know the
joke Suburban assholes that buy leather
outfits and think theyre bikers And
its a joke Im damn sick of So Im
keeping your friends bike Im keeping
this jacket and you guys are going to
turn the hell around and go back to
wherever you came from because the next
hundred miles of this highway belongs to
the Hells Angels
The color drains from the Wild Hogs faces

DUDLEY
Like an adopt a highway thing

JACK
Like a Go home or were going to split
your skulls open thing
Bob makes an audible whimper Doug elbows him and tries
to look brave
DOUG
All right We respect that this is your
turf and were sorry for bothering you
But we cant head back without my
friends bike So clearly were going to
have to work something out here
Jack looks back at the Hells Angels and nods

JACK
Youre right Were going to have to
work something out

CUT TO
EXT HIGHWAY US 50 - LATER

We see DOUG BOB and WOODY riding away from the bar
looking very glum The camera PULLS OUT to reveal the
rusty sidecar is now attached to Woodys bike DUDLEY
sits in it looking miserable and cold (having lost his
jacket and now in his sleeveless shirt)

The guys get a good distance away from the bar and Woody
waves for them to stop They do and Woody looks back to
the bar

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 48

WOODY
All right Lets just give them a few
minutes to get back inside - then shoot
right past them

BOB
What Are you nuts

DOUG
The trips over Woody Lets just head
back home

WOODY
Were going to turn back after all these
miles Just because some fat bullys
pushed us around
DOUG BOB
Yes Yes
Woody shakes his head and looks at Dudley

DUDLEY
I go wherever you go

WOODY
Good See Dudleys got some balls

DUDLEY
No my sidecars just attached to your
bike Id prefer to turn back but I
could only roll so far

WOODY
I cant believe you guys What a bunch
of pussies The whole point of this trip
is to live man

DOUG
Thats the point Woody Our lives
arent on this highway Theyre back
home We have families jobs wives
or cats Were not going to piss off a
biker gang Were going back
Woody takes this in gritting his teeth in disappointment

DOUG (CONTD)
Come on Woody You dont want to take
this risk You have Claudia and your
job You have a great life back home

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 49

Woody looks up at him Something about this has sparked
something in Woodys eyes but he covers it up with a
calm smile

WOODY
Youre right I do But maybe I should
talk to those guys one more time I
mean Im an executive at an Investment
firm Ive made a career out of
convincing people and these are just
people You guys wait here
Woody starts up his bike Doug and Bob look at each
other and shrug Dudley hurries out of the sidecar

DUDLEY
Ill wait here too Youll get better
gas mileage
Dudley gets out and falls to the ground

DUDLEY (CONTD)
Legs asleep
Woody shakes his head and starts back to the bar

EXT BIKER BAR - SAME TIME

Woody rides up to the bar and looks back to make sure
hes out of Doug Bob and Dudleys sight He sees that
he is and kneels next to the line of Hells Angels
motorcycles He takes out an army knife and slices
through one of the motorcycles gas line Gas starts
leaking out onto the ground and Woody nods

WOODY

(TO HIMSELF)
Come after us now assholes
Woody goes along to each bike smiling with a weird
recklessness as he slices through each gas line

EXT HIGHWAY US 50 - A FEW MINUTES LATER

WOODY pulls up on his bike where DOUG BOB and DUDLEY
are waiting

WOODY
Theyre cool with it We can press on

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 50

BOB
Seriously

WOODY
Yup I tried to be polite I tried to
reason I told them Dudley was dying
DUDLEY
What

WOODY
Well technically were all dying
Dudley Just very slowly
Dudley looks concerned

DUDLEY
Oh my god youre right

(REALIZING)
Im slowly dying

WOODY
Anyway none of that worked So I laid
it out for them I said Hey go ahead
and assault us Because we might be not
be real bikers but we know real lawyers
And the moment you touch us is the moment
you get your ass sued Because this is
the real world - with real laws and real
consequences And they backed down
The guys are impressed

DOUG
You really said that

WOODY
Yup And I think theyll give us
Dudleys bike on the way back so lets
go Quick Before they change their
mind
Woody quickly starts his bike and rides on The guys
shrug impressed and follow him
After a moment we see them all speed by the bar

INT BIKER BAR - SAME TIME

Jack is playing darts with the other bikers He goes to
throw a dart and hears engines roar past the bar outside

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 51
He quickly turns which makes the dart he was throwing
fly off target and stick into the shoulder of one of the
bikers (OILCAN)

OILCAN
Ow Shit man
Jack listens as the engines pass the bar and fade away
Jack shakes his head enraged

JACK

his peck

OILCAN (CONTD)

The Hells Angels roar away from the bar on their
motorcycles They get to the end of the driveway and
the bikes sputter and choke to a stop

ANGLE ON JACK Hes on his hog with a cigarette
dangling out of his mouth He looks down in confusion at
the suddenly stalled bike

JACK

Suddenly the cigarette falls out of Jacks mouth and
onto the ground A puddle of gas from the sliced line
catches on fire

JACK (CONTD)

The flames quickly follow the line of leaked gas like a
fuse back towards the bar

Almost as quickly as the bikers can turn to look the
flame has reached the parking area and ignited all the
puddles of gas They all watch in horror as the fire
ravenously engulfs the old wooden porch of the bar then
the roof

creeps over his face

space Theres a police car in the parking spot next to
them and the town sheriff CHARLEY comes running
towards it from across the street

CHARLEY

entire diner that there are bikers there

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 57

sound is a single fork dropping onto a plate

BUD is pulsing with anger but he swallows it down

BUD

enters the diner with a cocky swagger and has a seat at
the bar

MURDOCK

Doug starts to answer but Woody looking nervous cuts
him off

WOODY
--Oh were just a group of friends No

to pass by so its all good
MURDOCK

Bob hammers the table and stands up - his face red with
long-suppressed rage

BOB

consequences You hear me
Bob swats Murdocks beer out of his hand It spills all
over him Murdock is too filled with rage to speak

BOB (CONTD)
Now get out of here And if that gang of
inbred assholes needs things explained to

Woody puts his face into his hands

BOB (CONTD)

Bob kicks the stool out from under Murdock He almost
falls but catches himself on a stool He glares at the
guys but hes outnumbered He grits his teeth and
storms out the door Woody winces to himself as he
watches Murdock go This isnt good
After a moment BUD comes running out from behind the

to them

DOUG
Well Woody is the one who really--

BOB

Bob punches a handicapped parking sign which rattles
against its post then falls to the ground Bob
immediately looks regretful

DOUG

BOB
(suddenly meek again)
Should I fix it Oh man I should

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 64

DOUG

WOODY
Cant you call a bigger town or something

CHARLEY
Yeah Ive done that a few times But
the gang is always gone by the time they

gear which does protect you from being
hit but not from being dragged Also
one of the Dooble brothers tried to throw
tear gas but the bottle exploded and

dart up out of the ash and jabs it into his shoulder

OILCAN (CONTD)
Oww Dammit

Timberlakes Rock Your body

PLUMP MAN

The man drops to his knees at the edge of stage and
reaches his hand out to the audience like the star of a
boy band However its clearly making the people on the
dance floor uncomfortable
Meanwhile Doug Bob Woody and Dudley walk through the
square and are instantly greeted patted on the back and
thanked by each townsperson they pass The word is out
that these guys are heroes Doug gives a can you

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 68

WOODY

DUDLEY

(TO WOODY)

Dudley walks off towards the beer tent Woody looks to
the other guys with a puzzled look

Doug and Woody wince
ANGLE ON DUDLEY at the beer tent He gets in line
and realizes hes behind MAGGIE She smiles at him

Dudley goes to respond then decides to just give an
emphatic nod Maggie smiles

EXT TOWN SQUARE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
DOUG BOB and WOODY are sitting at a picnic table
drinking beer out of plastic cups They lean back and
soak up the small town celebration around them Its a
great night

DOUG
It doesnt get any better than this huh
Bob notices Doug getting ready to chomp down on a piece
of garlic bread

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 70

BOB
Thats a lot of carbs
Doug stops mid-bite and puts the bread down

DOUG
Thanks Bob You saved me from all
that buttery garlicky flavor
WOODY

No he didnt
Woody takes the garlic bread and crams it in his mouth

WOODY (CONTD)

(MOUTH FULL)
I did

DOUG
I hope you choke on it
CHARLEY approaches with his two deputies EARL DOOBLE and
BUCK DOOBLE They are chubby thirty-year old twins -
identical in every way except for the fact that Buck is
missing an ear on the right side of his head which the
skin has scarred back over It doesnt look good

CHARLEY
Howdy guys Welcome to the block party
These are my deputies Earl and Buck
Dooble
Earl shakes the guys hands

EARL
Im Earl and hes Buck Just remember
the brother with the word ear in his
name has both on his head

(LAUGHS)
I can only say that because Im on his
right side Which as you can see is
blown off
Earl laughs again as BUCK extends his hand - oblivious

BUCK
Im Buck and this is Earl Good luck
telling us apart
Buck laughs and turns to Charley exposing his missing
ear to the guys They draw back a little

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 71

DOUG
Well its nice to meet you guys Youve

CHARLEY
Yeah we got everything here Good

(yells at crowd of people)
Hey Thomas Milborn
A bookish man with a tweed jacket turns around and looks

EARL (CONTD)

(ANNOUNCING)
Convicted child molester
Thomas Milborn nods glumly and pulls his hands out of his
pockets The guys look at each other uneasily
BOB
Well Still a nice town

WOODY
If youre not a kid

DOUG
Or Thomas Milborn

ANGLE ON DANCE FLOOR AREA

DUDLEY is on the dance floor with MAGGIE The middle
aged guy on stage is letting loose with a rendition of
Ushers Yeah Maggie and Dudley dance conservatively
for a moment but as the beat gets ahold of Dudley he
starts getting into it He starts spinning around at a
rapid pace then drops to his knees slaps the ground and
shakes his head to the music

Maggie watches curiously as Dudley pulls himself along
the ground by his elbows - then springs up to his feet
and starts a move that resembles a sprinkler Maggie
grins - actually amused by Dudleys rhythmic passion

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 72

ANGLE ON The Wild Hogs table The guys sit with
Charley Buck and Earl - watching Dudley with a curious
loo

CHARLEY
Looks like your friend and Maggie are
hitting it off

DOUG
Yeah I think he really likes that girl

CHARLEY
Well Maggies a great woman

EARL
Yup Big cans too Buck liked her but
you know Hes a deformed freak

Buck on Earls left stares out at Maggie and Dudley
deaf to the conversation

BUCK
I used to like that girl but then I
realized I can do better
The guys look at Buck

CHARLEY
So why are you guys taking this road
trip anyway

DOUG
Ahh just to escape for a bit

WOODY
Hey were not escaping anything man
Were on this trip to live

CHARLEY
I know what you mean Sometimes things
in life can bother you and sometimes
nothing in life can bother you Either
way youve got take a break from it
Happiness is somewhere between boredom
and stress
Doug is surprised at Charleys insight So is Woody

WOODY
Exactly Which is why we need to keep
riding until we figure out where that
happiness is You dont get old Doug
back by just staying put

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 73

CHARLEY
Old Doug

DOUG
Yeah Apparently Ive lost him I dont
sing Bon Jovi anymore

WOODY
You did lose him Doug You know why
Youre housebroken Youre too
comfortable Youve got to snap out of
it
Doug nods halfheartedly He knows woody might be right
CHARLEY

(TO DOUG)
Woodys got a point there Comfortable
can be a bad thing You have to wake up
and slap the bull once in a while

WOODY
Right Slap the bull
(then to Charley)
What

CHARLEY
Slapping the bull is kind of the local
test of manhood Its a way to prove you
arent controlled by fear Weve all
done it

EARL
Yup Even torn-open head here
He nods at Buck on his left

BUCK
You know I slapped the bull once
Woody smiles slyly Doug looks concerned

WOODY
Were slapping the bull

DOUG
I dont think we need to I mean we can
have our own test of manhood Lets see
how many ears of corn we can eat or
something Ill start
Doug grabs an ear of corn and takes a bite but Woody
just grins with that reckless look in his eyes

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 74
WOODY
We are slapping the bull

Doug knows its no use He nods defeated

Cut TO
EXT COW PASTURE - THAT EVENING

DOUG BOB WOODY CHARLEY BUCK and EARL approach a fence
surrounding a pasture Charley smiles

CHARLEY

Charley gestures to a lone bull grazing in the pasture
Hes a frighteningly large bull with enormous horns

WOODY

Woody nods

The guys look at him surprised and somewhat impressed
Woody takes a breath and climbs over the fence He
approaches the Bull very quietly and cautiously He gets
within three feet of it leans in and slaps the Bull hard
on the ass
The bull makes an annoyed sound and turns around but
Woody is already hightailing it back to the fence with
an exhilarated look on his face

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 75

WOODY (CONTD)
Whhhheeeeeeew

Woody and Bob look at each other then to the Bull -

WOODY
Doug wait

run
Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 76

DOUG
Wheeeeew Yeah
Doug runs across the field but the Bull - now fully
alert - swivels with magnificent agility and breaks into
an angry charge towards Doug
The guys all watch in horror as the Bull quickly gains on
Doug Doug sees the fear on the guys faces and looks
back over his shoulder His smile quickly turns to
terror

DOUG (CONTD)
Ahhhhhhhh
Its too late The Bull catches Doug and bucks him into
the air Doug flies ten feet and comes crashing down on
the muddy grass The Bull takes a few steps back and
starts lining up another charge at him

WOODY
Oh no you dont
Woody jumps over the fence and runs into the field

WOODY (CONTD)
Heeeeey Hey you Come get me Bull
The Bull notices Woody and starts to Charge him

WOODY (CONTD)

Run Doug Go

Doug climbs to his feet and sees the bull charging Woody
Woody realizes hes in trouble and starts to run again
The bull quickly catches him and rams him into the air
Woody lands hard with a grunt

The bull turns back to charge at Woody again and Bob
jumps over the fence

BOB
Hey Leave him alone You want some of
this Come get this
Bob sprints out into the field The bull snorts and
starts towards him The Bull closes on Bob quick but at
the last moment Bob dives of the way The bull goes
flying past him

BOB (CONTD)
Hah Missed me you fat bastard
Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 77

Doug and Woody look impressed as Bob helps them hurry
towards the fence Charley and Buck hold a gate open for
them as the Bull makes a turn and lines the group up but
theyve already made it to the gate They go through and
Charley shuts it behind them They lean back on the
fence trying to gather their bearings except Bob - who
is thrilled

BOB (CONTD)
Did you see me I dodged him I dodged
that stupid cow How cool am--
Suddenly the Bull charges into the fence which Bobs
butt is sticking through Bob goes flying and lands face
down in the dirt He scrambles back up furious

BOB (CONTD)
You son of a bitch You want to keep it
going You want to take cheap shots
Come on
Bob tries to climb back into the pasture but the guys
restrain him

BOB (CONTD)

(TO CHARLEY)
Give me your gun Give me the gun He
deserves it

(TO BULL)
Ill kill you
Doug and Woody hold on to Bob until he calms down Doug
and Woody start to laugh Bob cools off for another
moment then starts laughing as well

WOODY
No this is living

DOUG
We just slapped the bull
The group high fives each other in congratulations and
starts away Bruised muddy and laughing
ANGLE ON THE BULL He pushes on the gate that Charley
was holding open The gate swings open
ANGLE ON WOODY BOB and DOUG They walk with Charley
and the Dooble brothers laughing and carrying on

Bob does an impression of how he dodged it and goes for
some more high fives - but suddenly the bull charges
into frame and nails him As Bob goes flying we

CUT TO
EXT TOWN SQUARE BLOCK PARTY - LATER THAT NIGHT

The block party is winding down Dudley is sitting by
himself at a picnic table in post-Maggie bliss

DOUG WOODY and BOB approach dirty and beaten from the
bull - but carrying on happily

WOODY
Man did you see the look on Bobs face

Woody and Doug laugh Bob looks pissed

BOB

DOUG

(LAUGHING)

Doug and Woody laugh again Bob just steams They spot
DUDLEY and head over to him

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 79

DUDLEY

that ipod was just a well-designed whore
The guys smile Its been a good night for all of them

DOUG

fishing
The guys start walking towards the Main Street hotel

WOODY
Okay fine But after fishing - we hit
the open road and keep moving okay

DOUG
Open road baby

BOB

Wild Hogs ride

The guys continue with enthusiastic cheers as we hear the
off-screen rumble of engines Doug looks down the street
and sees THE HELLS ANGELS All forty of them are

riding into town - and the guys will be in their view any
second Woody is frozen with fear

DOUG
Are you kidding me Woody youre going
to have to talk to these guys again Get
them to leave this town alone--

WOODY
DOUG BOB and DUDLEY look confused Woody looks around
desperately for somewhere to hide - but the Hells Angels
are too close Theres no time Woody spots a port-o-
potty from the block party and starts corralling Doug
Bob and Dudley into it

WOODY (CONTD)
Go Go Go
Woody pushes his puzzled friends into the port-o-potty
then gets in with them and shuts the door just as the
Hells Angels cruise by them

INT PORT-O-POTTY - CONTINUOUS

All four guys are squished inside the port-o-potty like

DOUG
Woody What the hell is wrong with--

WOODY

EXT TOWN SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

The Hells Angels park their bikes We see all the
townspeople have stopped enjoying themselves and just
stand there scared Jack gets off his bike and looks

Woody guiltily avoids Dougs glare and watches the Hells
Angels through a vent in the port-o-potty
EXT TOWN SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

The townspeople arent saying a word Jack continues to
pace in front of the diner

JACK
Come on now You shouldnt be

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 81
INT PORT-O-POTTY - CONTINUOUS

Upon hearing this BOB DUDLEY and DOUG all look at
WOODY who shrugs sheepishly Bob is enraged

BOB
You son of a bitch
Bob lunges at Woody but the sudden shifting of weight is
too much for the port-o-potty

EXT TOWN SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

The port-o-potty tips over All the Hells Angels turn
and look as it crashes over on its side They continue
to stare at it curiously

INT PORT-O-POTTY - CONTINUOUS

The guys now on their side freeze as they see through
the vent that the Hells Angels are staring at them Its
a very tense moment as they wait to see if theyve been
discovered After a moment we hear a glup glup
glup And the guys smell something curious

BOB

(WHISPERING)
What is that

DUDLEY
(WHISPERING)
Its that blue port-o-potty juice Its
coming out of the can
The guys all cringe in disgust but know they cant move

EXT TOWN SQUARE - CONTINUOUS

Jack finally turns away from the pot-o-potty and smirks
JACK

(TO GANG)
Now thats a port-o-potty that aint
worth shit
The Hells Angels all laugh and turn back to the diner

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 82

JACK (CONTD)
All right then Nobody wants to tell me

your memory
Jack takes a garbage can and tosses it into the diner
window The crowd gasps as the Hells Angels laugh
CHARLEY steps out of the crowd

CHARLEY

bull Its up past the lake a ways
Jack smiles

JACK

Saddle up boys

reeeal soon Because I dont let any man
get away from me
The gang snickers Jack realizes
JACK (CONTD)

(TO GANG)
Shut the hell up I didnt-- You know
what I meant
Jack starts his bike and roars out of the town The
others follow him gunning their bikes and leaving skid
marks and smoke in their trail A kid yells at the Hells
Angels as they ride out of sight

KIDS
Go ahead and come back The Wild Hogs
arent afraid you The Wild Hogs arent
afraid of anything
Suddenly the door pops open on the port-o-potty and the
WILD HOGS topple out of it in a heap We see theyre
soaked in blue port-o-potty juice
They scramble to their feet and run towards the large
fountain in the middle of the town square

DOUGBOBWOODY DUDLEY

Ahhhh Im going to vomit Ecchhh

The townspeople watch in silence as the guys jump into
the fountain and try to rinse off

Bob puts his head under a water-spouting marble fish

BOB
It got in my hair Gross
The guys desperately try to rinse off the juice - then
drenched from head to toe turn their glare to Woody

DOUG

(TO WOODY)
You lied didnt you You stood there
and lied to us

BOB

WOODY

DOUG

DOUG

Why Its just a stupid vacation

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 84

WOODY

Doug and Bob go silent Woody looks away - trying to
collect himself After a moment he faces them

WOODY (CONTD)

Doug Bob and Dudley are stupefied Woody takes a deep

breath and continues
WOODY (CONTD)

Woody lowers his head The guys take this in for a
minute Woody looks at them waiting for their sympathy
Finally Doug speaks

DOUG
(realizing to Woody)
This trip is just you running from your
life Your miserable screwed up life

(GETTING ANGRIER)
And you knew you couldnt go back to it
so instead you screwed up our lives
too You asshole
Woodys puppy-dog face dissolves

WOODY
Fine I see how important I am to you
guys Thats just fine I just thought
being a Wild Hog meant something
Woody takes off his Wild Hogs jacket and throws it at
their feet He hops out of the fountain and storms off
down the street

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 85

DOUG
It doesnt mean anything Its just a
patch my wife made
Doug Bob and Dudley look at each other After a moment
they look over to the sidewalk and see
ALL THE TOWNSPEOPLE staring at them in disappointed
silence Slowly the townspeople turn and quietly head
back to their homes Doug Bob and Dudley lower their
heads in disgrace So much for being heroes

CHARLEY

Charley runs out the back door of the station EARL
shakes his head and looks at Doug

EARL
You know people have feelings Sure I

has the right to hurt Charley like that
He has both sides of his head
Earl storms off leaving BUCK who was standing on his

stands there looking at Doug and Dudley

Dudley looks to Doug curiously

making sure the Hells Angels are still sleeping then
starts walking towards a wooded park behind the town

EXT PARK - A MOMENT LATER

Doug walks through the park looking depressed He
passes through a small playground and has a seat ona
bench He watches all the children play and his eyes
fall on four young boys happily riding their bicycles
together They have cards in their spokes making engine
sounds as they ride around having a great time together
Doug smiles and watches them play together

FADE OUT MUSIC CUE

BUD
Well maybe its trying to and you just

DOUG

Bud smiles and looks out at the kids playing

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 90

BUD
Its the funny thing about life It has
to be an adventure to feel right But
when you become a husband and a Dad you
realize adventure is risk anda family
man has no place in his life for risk
Doug takes this in then realizes

DOUG
Youre right Thats why I stopped
singing Bon Jovi Life used to be a
risk That was old Doug And now its
gone Ive taken away all the risk

BUD
Yup And if you try to make livin too
safe then its not livin at all

DOUG

DOUG

Woody starts to get up but then looks at the water
around him and sits

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 92

DOUG
You would have stormed off right then

WOODY

(DEFLATED)

Doug nods and looks out at the water They sit there in
silence for another moment

WOODY (CONTD)

marriage and failed career Im just

Woody eyes water a little and he quickly turns away from
Doug They sit there for another moment

DOUG
Well whats the point of being in a
motorcycle gang if we cant ourselves in
a little trouble
Woody looks back at him Doug smiles a little bit

DOUG (CONTD)

Woody smiles a little as well

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 93

Doug looks around the canoe for a paddle

DOUG
Did you bring the paddles

WOODY
No I wasnt even going to take this
thing out but I didnt want you to think
I was just standing at the lake waiting
for you

DOUG
Why were you here

WOODY

Doug nods Bob walks up on the shore holding a
styrofoam cup

BOB

DOUG

Bob looks at the styrofoam cup and nods

BOB

WOODY

Woody smiles at Doug

DOUG

(TO BOB)

Bob nods and picks up a paddle He throws it toward the
canoe but it lands ten yards short and sinks

BOB
Shit Hold on

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 94
Bob grabs another paddle and throws it This time it
lands even shorter Bob looks around for another paddle

DOUG
Were those the only two paddles

BOB

down on the ground It breaks into a hundred pieces
Jack smiles at Dudley and puts his foot through whats
left of it The Hells Angels stifle laughter Dudley is
starting to look a little nervous

JACK

(TO DUDLEY)

Dudley starts for the door but several Hells Angels move

his chair

DOUG

new fire behind his eyes His suburban quietude has

transformed into something more

WOODY

DOUG

Were not calling the Highway patrol

Were not gathering ten thousand dollars

Were going over there and getting our

friend back

CHARLEY

I dont think thats the safest plan

DOUG

Its not But sometimes you have to do

the things that arent safe to create a

world that youre happy being in

Hells Angels dont want our ten thousand

These

dollars They want our dignity They

valiant
want us to be afraid of them just like

this town is And once they know were

afraid they can do whatever they want
Thats how these guys exist Thats how
they ride into this town and tear it to
pieces Because people want to keep
their lives safe so badly they give up
the best part about it
Doug takes his Wild Hogs jacket and pulls it on

DOUG (CONTD)
-The adventure
Doug looks at Woody and Bob Woody smiles and pulls on
his jacket

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 105

Doug smiles and taps fists with Bob and Woody

Cut TO

DOUG BOB and WOODY walk along main street shoulder to
shoulder They look to each other with a smile Even
though theyre walking into the mouth of the beast
theyre finally who they were in college again
Fearless They approach the diner and stand out on the
street like gunslingers in the Old West calling their
enemy out of the saloon

MUSIC CUE FADE OUT

The front door of the bar opens and the HELLS ANGELS
swagger out After a moment the gang parts and JACK
steps out in front of them
JACK
Well well The Wild Hogs Im glad
to see youre finally showing us a little
respect

DOUG
Wheres Dudley
Jack turns back and nods at one of the Hells Angels
They push DUDLEY forward We see he is now completely
cocooned in duct-tape - like a mummy There is only a
small slit for his mouth and eyes

DUDLEY
(muffled from tape)
Hey guyth
Doug shakes his head

DOUG
Just hold tight Dudley

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 106
Dudley tries to nod but cant He leans his torso back
and forth to signal yes

DOUG (CONTD)

(TO JACK)

Doug looks to Bob and Woody They nod encouragingly
Doug gathers his courage and turns back to Jack

DOUG

The Hells Angels start to laugh Jack turns back to them
and smiles Can you believe these guys Doug is
starting to lose his cool

DOUG (CONTD)
(yells to Jack)
Give us back our friend asshole
The Hells Angels are suddenly silent Jack turns back
and looks at Doug in disbelief - then rage Doug starts
to look a little worried

JACK

DOUG

Crowbars tire irons bats They start moving towards
Doug Woody and Bob Bob looks to Doug

DOUG

Woody turns around to see Hells Angles have now closed in
behind them blocking their escape Jack smiles

JACK

WOODY

The Hells Angels close to within a few feet of the Wild
Hogs and raise their weapons to strike

DOUG
Wait Wait a minute
The Hells Angels stop

DOUG (CONTD)

(TO JACK)

home Youll never see us again But
If I win you let Dudley go and you never
set foot in Lucas again This town is

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 108
Jack looks back to the Hells Angels who chuckle This
will be a quick fight

DOUG (CONTD)
Well You in or are you too much of a
bitch
The Hells Angels freeze Jack grits his teeth in rage
and turns back to Doug

JACK
All right Lets party tough guy

DOUG

Doug nods trying to look confidant but its quickly
fading away

DOUG (CONTD)

(UNSURE)
Great

CUT TO
EXT TOWN SQUARE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

DOUG and JACK are standing in their corners opposite
each other in the dirt parking lot Theyre surrounded
by a circle of Hells Angels rowdily waiting for the
fight to commence WOODY and BOB coach Doug in his
corner

WOODY
Just stay clear of the big punches
Youve got more stamina than this guy

DOUG
All right When do I hit back

WOODY
Um Just try and get him tired I
dont think punches will do much to him
Doug gives Woody a concerned look Woody shrugs Jack
steps into the circle and throws off his jacket

JACK

(CALLING OUT)
Time for your beating yuppie

DOUG
(TO BOB)
Tell my wife I won - then got hit by a

truck
Doug takes a deep breath and starts into the circle

DOUG (CONTD)

(TO JACK)
All right Lets do this--
Doug doesnt even finish his sentence as Jack lands a
punch on the side of his head Doug is stunned as Jack
sends his other fist crashing into Dougs forehead Doug
goes flying backwards and falls down in the dirt The
Hells Angels cheer Jack high fives them as Doug
struggles back to his feet and looks back at Woody and
Bob cradling his face

DOUG (CONTD)
Ow Dammit Jesus that hurt

(TO WOODY)
It really hurts Damn
Jack comes back over to Doug Jack throws another right
but this time Doug ducks still cradling his jaw

DOUG (CONTD)
Yes--
But Doug is instantly punched in the stomach by Jacks
other fist Doug winces as he doubles over in agony
Drool drips out of his mouth This isnt pretty
Jack takes him by the back of the shirt and lifts him
into the air The Hells Angels cheer as Jack tosses Doug
five yards into the dirt

JACK
Dont get tired yet The hurt is just
beginning
Doug tries to stand back up but its getting harder He
slyly grabs a handful of sand as he starts to stand

DOUG

Hah

Doug whips around and throws the sand towards Jacks
face However his aim is off The sand hits Jack in the
chest and falls away Jack looks at Doug and shakes his
head

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 110

DOUG (CONTD)

Damn

Jack punches Doug square in the face again Doug
crumples to the ground in pain Jack turns back to the
Hells Angels

JACK

Man this isnt even a workout

Jack laughs and puts his aviator sunglasses back on as
Doug quickly stands up and whips around at him

DOUG

Ahhh

Doug throws another handful of sand This time he aims
carefully but Jack now has sunglasses on The sand
bounces harmlessly off the lenses Doug cringes and
waits for the punch which comes like a freight train
into his stomach Doug doubles over again as Jack lines
up another punch

JACK
This ones gonna break bone

DOUG
Wait Wait--
Doug straightens up and looks curiously at Jacks mouth

DOUG (CONTD)
Your tooth-- Thats an acute periodontal
abscess

JACK
What

DOUG
look I really hate you but I dont want
to feel responsible for a death Ima
dentist I took an oath Same one as
doctors If the infection in that tooth
gets to the root - it could seep into
your nervous system Just let me look--
Doug slowly reaches towards Jacks mouth Jack doesnt
move
JACK
Youre a dentist

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 111

DOUG

and pushes him backwards Doug falls

the end

Jack instantly punches Woody in the face Woody falls
down next to Doug Doug turns his head to Woody
Theyre both bleeding from their noses and lips

DOUG

(TO WOODY)

JACK

Bob takes a deep breath and bends down an grabs a long
lead pipe He starts towards Jack

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 112

BOB
Alright Mother f--
Bob suddenly trips on the lead pipe and hits the ground
Doug shakes his head

DOUG
(TO BOB)
Just stay down
Bob nods
JACK

Well I guess thats all of you--
DUDLEY still covered in tape comes running into the
circle from the other side

DUDLEY

Ahhhhhhhhhhh

Dudley charges Jack but his limited mobility results not
in a tackle but in him leaning on Jack After a moment
Jack takes a step back and Dudley falls to the ground

DUDLEY (CONTD)
Ow
Jack cracks his knuckles and looks to OILCAN

JACK
Give me the crowbar
Oilcan nods and hands it to Jack Jack smiles at the
four fallen Wild Hogs

JACK (CONTD)
Guess you guys are wishing youd
listened now huh
Jack smiles as we hear
SFX SIREN
Jack and the Hells Angels look up the road
ANGLE ON DOWN STREET CHARLEY is riding his shiny
Harley Davidson police bike Behind him are BUCK and
EARL driving a police cruiser Behind the cruiser is a
large group of people carrying rakes hedge clippers
brooms Its all the citizens of Lucas
ANGLE ON Hells Angels Theyre stunned

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 113
CHARLEY pulls up to the group and gets off his
motorcycle

CHARLEY
All right Jack Thatll be enough of
that

JACK

Are you kidding And what makes you
think you can ride a motorcycle without
our permission

CHARLEY
Ill ride whatever I want from now on
Im the sheriff of Lucas and Im not
tolerating any more lawlessness
BOB helps DOUG WOODY and DUDLEY to their feet as Jack
takes a step towards Charley

CHARLEY (CONTD)
Id stop right there Jack
Earl and Buck get out of the cruiser with two shotguns
They cock the guns and walk to Charleys side Jack
looks concerned

JACK
What Youre going to shoot us

CHARLEY
No Not unless you want to do something
stupid like ignoring--
Buck grabs his missing ear as he starts to loose his
balance He tips over and falls As he hits the ground
the shotgun fires and hits OILCAN in the leg Oilcan
falls to the ground

OILCAN
Ahhhhhh He shot me I just got shot
Charley looks over at Buck then back to Jack

CHARLEY
Um Yeah I guess were going to shoot
you
The Hells Angels suddenly look nervous and back up a few
steps Charley steps towards Jack

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 114

CHARLEY (CONTD)
Were not going to live in fear of your
gang anymore Jack If the Wild Hogs can
stand up to you - so can everyone of us
The crowd of townspeople gathers behind Charley and nods

BUD

(FROM CROWD)
Thats right You mess up our town
well do the same to you
The crowd cheers as THOMAS MILBORN the guy Earl pointed
out as a child molester steps forward

THOMAS MILBORN
Yeah People like you are the scum of
the earth
The crowd is silent for a moment then hesitantly gives a
uncomfortable cheer Charley turns back to the Hells
Angels

CHARLEY
The point is from now on you need to
treat Lucas with kindness and respect
And when you do youll be treated the
same And if you dont
Charley looks over at OILCAN whos tending to the bullet
wound in his thigh

CHARLEY (CONTD)
Then I guess well keep shooting you
Got it
Jack looks at all the townspeople He knows hes beaten
He nods bitterly

CHARLEY (CONTD)
Good Now Id like you to untape our
friend Dudley
Jack signals to one of the Hells Angels He grabs
Dudleys tape and spins him around to untape him

DUDLEY
Ow Ow Ow ow Ow Ow
After a painful minute Dudley is untaped Charley looks
at Jacks jacket

Wild Hogs writers first draft 70605 115

CHARLEY
And I believe thats his jacket
Jack begrudgingly takes off Dudleys Wild Hogs jacket
and tosses it to him Dudley proudly puts it on

CHARLEY (CONTD)
And as I recall that 51 Panhead was
traded to Dudley
Jack looks over at the mint condition motorcycle and
shakes his head

JACK
No way He can have his Sportster back

CHARLEY
Uh uh A deals a deal Jack
Jack grits his teeth and throws a set of keys at Dudley
The crowd chatters in approval as Dudley gets on the 51
Panhead and starts the engine He revs it a few times
and Jack shoots Doug an infuriated glare

JACK

(TO DOUG)
Hope youre happy You suburban posers
are a disease You need to learn some
damn respect for real bikers
Doug smiles
DOUG
You still dont get it do you Jack

JACK
Get what

DOUG
We are the real bikers
As Doug says this Dudley kicks the Panhead into gear and
shoots forward - out of control He instantly crashes
into a steel light post Everyone in the crowd cringes

DUDLEY LOOKS
as the bike falls over in a crumpled heap
up from the ground

DUDLEY
Yeah Ill take the Sportster back I
guess
