hoe lying on the ground and begins to chop weeds it is
a vegetable garden and it is well tended

As he works he sings a few bars of a song to himself
A country Western song We dont hear enough of the song
to know if it is familiar or what kind of a singer he is

om ROSA LEE comes around the house and jcins him in the garden
She has a basket and begins to pick tomatoes and dig turnips
He stops singing as she approaches

They work along in silence for a beat and then she begins
singing a hymn to herselfCount Your Blessings She
has a pleasant voice After a few phrases he joins in
singing with her He has a stronger voice than hers but

we can still tell nothing of its quality They continue
singing as they work

They hear a car drive up The driver honks for service and

MAC
I just came across that old song
one day I wrote it I dont know
how many years ago I couldnt do
nothing with it then so I dont
know why I figured I could do any-
thing with it now Any way I
figured if I could I might get us
a few dollars ahead so you wouldnt
have to work so hard

ROSA LEE
I dont work ali that hard

MAC

Yes you do too

ROSA LEE
You work hard too

MAC
Any way I just thought Id try Harry
since he was an old friend of mine
He showed it to Dixie which I didn’t
really want him to do I really only

wanted his opinion Any way she said

ANGLE - ROSA LEE

it was no good and he agreed with her
(He cries) You know I dont give

a God damm about any of this no more
So what in the hell is wrong with me
I guess it’s just hearing about my
little girl being grown up and all and
being spoiled by Dixie
ANGLE - MAC
as he listens

ANGLE - ROSA LEE

ROSA LEE
Oh sure I know thats hard on
you not being able to see her (SHE
goes to MAC SHE takes his hand)

I love you you know and I would
hate for anything to ever come

between us but I swear if I ever
had to give up Sonny I dont know
what Id do

When his daddy died and people said
oh it’s too bad youre left with
this little boy to raise - too bad
for who I said - not for me I
consider it a prvilege to have this
plessed child to raise And I did
too

ANGLE - MAC AND ROSA LEE

And every night when I say my prayers
and I thank the good Lord for all

his many blessings and tender mercies
to me Sonny and you head the list

He sings part of the song
It is the song we have heard earlier The song is
personal yet direct and affecting in its simplicity
as the best of Country Western songs can be His manner
of singing the song also is direct and uncomplicated

and one senses whatever else he has a very personal style
