INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

A recently applied coat of grey-green paint gives the
kitchen walls an antiseptic luster Four large stainless
steel metal tables stand in the middle of the room The
north wall has three metal doors leading to two pantries
and a walk-in freezer The opposite (south) wall has two
large industrial stoves

GEORGE a mid-twenties white male with a stout frame and
amiable air stands at a cutting board He is wearing a
chefs shirt checkered pants and a baseball cap that
has a picture of a coyotes head He is cleaning a large
piece of meat

MAX a taller white male of the same age walks in from
the pantry He too wears the standard cooking attire and
his long hair is tied back in a ponytail With some
effort he lugs out a crate of cabbages

George stops dicing for a moment and looks at him

GEORGE
Well get to that tomorrow
put it back
(annoyed)

Any other pointless yet
strenuous activities youd
like me to perform Sir George

George doesnt respond He looks back down to his work
Max lugs the crate back

George inserts the knife underneath a large fatty deposit
and work the blade back and forth He hears the loud
THUD of Max dropping the crate in the pantry

GEORGE
Be careful with those

MAX (0S)
They were askin for it

George pulls the rope of gristle from the beef loosening
its edges up with his knife as he goes

Max re-enters the kitchen

MAX
If were gonna finish early
Id like to get a couple of
beers before our slot

George nods He quickens the pace moving the knife more
vigorously

MAX
(continuing)
Come on just leave it for the
morning

The knife slides back and forth
GEORGE
(looking at Max
still cutting)
Id like to season it tonight
George looks back down to his work
MAX
Who cares theyre not gonna
notice it anyways
George looks up again still slicing

GEORGE
I want to- SHIT

George SLAMS down his knife He grabs his left hand with
his right

MAX
How bad

George walks over to the sink Max grabs a towel

George lets go of his left hand He stares at it fora
moment unable to discern the cut

GEORGE
Not that bad

He gently squeezes his index finger Blood streams from
it in an opaque swatch

GEORGE
(continuing)
Shit

George turns the faucet on He puts his hand under the
running water

Max hands him the towel
INT GARAGESTUDIO — NIGHT

The room is a garage that has been turned into a low-rent
music studio

George sits on an amplifier blankly staring at an
ashtray His left index finger is heavily bandaged Max
paces about the room holding his bass guitar by the neck-
he does not look happy PHILLIP a long-haired blond
male mid twenties is asleep in a chair his guitar
leaning against his leg

ROBERT a bald white male in his forties adjusts a
microphone in front of a bass drum He walks over to a
control board and pulls a set of headphones over his ears

ROBERT
Max can you kick a test for
me

Max obviously annoyed with this request rests his bass
against the wall

He walks behind the drumkit and sits down He looks at
Robert

Robert nods Max kicks the bass pedal BOOM

ROBERT
(continuing)
A little louder please

BOOM

ROBERT
Not that loud

MAX
I’m not the fucking drummer
You may notice that I actually
bothered to show

ROBERT
(paying no attention)
Again

BOOM George lifts his cigarette out of the ashtray
BOOM The cigarette is three quarters ash BOOM

ROBERT
(continuing)
That’s enough thanks

Max stands and walks over to his bass
GEORGE
(still looking at his
cigarette)
How much more time do we have
left

ROBERT
Forty-five minutes

GEORGE
If we cut out now can you give
us a small break

ROBERT
When you book time here you
pay for time here your
recorded product is only
incidental

MAX
(sarcastically)
That didn’t sound rehearsed
Bet you never said that
before I bet you’re always-

GEORGE
Shut up Max Robbie when can
we book again

MAX
(sarcastically)
Are you giving up We can
still do this Well just
play everything double time
and slow it down by half in
the mix

ROBERT
Next Thursday after midnight
I can give you the same rate

GEORGE
Were not gonna have the money
that soon but I’11 call you

George clicks the power switch on his amplifier off The
button’s luminance flickers away

INT GARAGESTUDIO - LATER THAT NIGHT

Robert is eating a sandwich that has his undivided
attention George Max and Phillip stand in front of
the garage door holding their guitar cases Robert takes
another bite from his sandwich
Max BANGS loudly on the garage door Robert puts his
sandwich down He walks over to the door and takes out
a key inserting it in a makeshift security device
The mechanical noises of the garage door whir to life
The door opens slower than frozen molasses
PHILLIP
I’m going to Europe soon I
like Europe

Max looks over at George George stares straight ahead
Max turns back to face the rising garage door

The door has just barely risen to ankle level
EXT GARAGESTUDIO - SAME

The door slowly rises revealing their feet
Then their shins

Then their knees

INT GARAGESTUDIO — SAME

The door continues to climb

They both begin to laugh Phillip yawns

EXT GARAGESTUDIO - SAME
FADE TO BLACK
INT KITCHEN - DAY

George in standard cooking attire stands at the stove
sauteing meat and onions in a large pan

Similarly dressed Max and WILLIAM a younger Latin male
stand chopping vegetables on cutting boards atop two of
the large tables

William dices celery and puts the pieces in a bowl
George walks over to William and stands behind him

GEORGE
A little finer

William repositions his knife slightly and severs a small
piece of from a stalk of celery He lifts it up to show
George
WILLIAM

GEORGE
Si es bueno

George walks over to Max and looks over his shoulder
Max is chopping carrots

GEORGE
(continuing)

quart containers of that

MAX

George walks away from Max to return to the stove when a
series of ELECTRONIC BEEPS makes him pause

George looks over to the west wall Max stops cutting
and looks at George William continues working

The door on the east wall opens and RICKY a heavy white
male mid-twenties enters wearing street clothes and
carrying a canvas bag

RICKY

Max returns to work as does George Ricky stands still
the realization of his carelessness immobilizing him
momentarily William looks up at Ricky for a moment
Ricky couldn’t look more guilty

RICKY
(continuing)
I’m sorry guys

Ricky reaches into his bag and pulls out his kitchen
knife

WILLIAM
Jus’ had it sharpen

RICKY

Ricky walks towards the bathroom He grabs the door
handle and holds it for a moment He lets go and turns
around to face the kitchen

RICKY
(continuing)

last night

Ricky turns and enters the bathroom
INT KITCHEN - LATE
George Max William and Ricky are all silently working

Max fills the third quart container with diced carrots
He walks over to the sink to wash his hands He turns on
the water and puts his hands under the stream

MAX
Shit

Max jerks his hands violently away from the sink

MAX
(continuing)
I must do that five times a
day When are they gonna
switch these handles the right
way
GEORGE
I don’t know This place has
tons of little glitches like
that It’s probably not a
real high priority

MAX
How hard can it be to put the
handle that says C on the
cold side and the handle that
says H on the hot side
(beat)
Do they need a specialist

GEORGE
Quit your moaning

Ricky turns on the sink by the “H” handle He tests the
water first and then proceeds to wash his hands

GEORGE
(continuing)
William que tienes el pollo

he speaks their name)
George Max Ricky William

Gregory inhales over the metal bowl near him

Gregory looks at Max unamused

GEORGE
It’s a shredded chicken in a
creamed curry sauce

GREGORY

to do is give any of the
patients indigestion

Gregory looks inside the bowl a moment longer

the cooks at work

a code each number pressed sounding a loud ELECTRONIC
BEEP He tries the door handle but it does not open
He types the code again The door opens and he leaves

into large metal bowls

placing a tray of piled plates upon it The sound of a

metal bowl They walk carefully over to Ricky who stands
at the small metal table with the tray of plates

George Max and William rest their bowls upon the table
Ricky places a large ladle in each one A LOUD SCREAM
erupts from nowhere and is gone a moment later None of
the cooks seem surprised by the scream nor do any of them
react to it

A sliding vertical door with a metal handle rests on the
wall just above the table The four men wait patiently
while JB’s voice booms in from the other room

on the event JB swings out at something CRACK JB
falls out of George’s field of vision

A subdued REDHEADED INMATE in a chokehold is visible
through streaming gravy George looks at another INMATE
The inmate watches the fray silently

JB (0S)
George

GEORGE
Yeah

JB (0S)

I’m taking the rude fellow who
doesn’t like your cooking
someplace else for lunch

That OK

GEORGE
Much appreciated JB I wont
serve until you get back

George looks for JB through the rolling ichor of mash
meat and gravy but is unable to locate him

A MAN SUCKING HIS THUMB stares directly at George
George looks at him for a moment The man’s glare does
not waver in the least George a little uneasy looks
away

RICKY
Do you know why that guy threw
the tray

MAX

GEORGE
(pointing to the
window)

William miras

William walks over and tries to look through the oozing
sludge of food

The window is utterly opaque

WILLIAM
No estoy-

A hand wipes the food away from the other side THUMB
the man who was sucking his thumb is only inches from
the window He looks from George to William to Ricky to
Max His face is devoid of any readable emotion

George and William remain still and silent

Max BANGS his ladle on the window The noise startles
George William and Ricky THUMB does not respond but
continues his deadpan gaze at Max

JB (OS)
After we clean this up we’ll
proceed with lunch Hey what
do you think makes you so
special huh Back in line

With a lingering gaze THUMB departs from the cook’s line
of vision

INT KITCHEN - LATER
The cooks are dishing lunch THUNDER RUMBLES

Ricky places the plate upon a tray and slides it back
through

MAN (0S)

GEORGE

George points to the window Ricky slides the vertical
cover down

RICKY

INT PANTRY -— SAME
The pantry is long and narrow Jars and containers fill
the multi-tiered shelves George walks over to the
tomato sauce He pulls a large can off of the shelf and

rests it on the floor He pulls another And another
George reaches deeper but is taken by a pleasant surprise

George laughs
INT KITCHEN — SAME

William and Ricky are washing the large metal bowls and
ladles in the sink Max is opening a bag of chicken

GEORGE (0S)

George looks at Rickys pillow a moment longer before
dropping it to the ground He then pulls the string
attached to the light above The light switches off
George takes a seat on the ground He fluffs up Ricky’s
pillow He stretches his legs out In the silence
George hears rain patter on the roof

George slowly lies back

George quickly falls asleep DISTANT THUNDER RUMBLES
INT PHILLIP’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The room is wallpapered with assorted MAPS Upon a large
table rests several GLOBES Phillip is sitting on his
bed playing his guitar A GIRL sits on the floor with
her legs drawn up to her chin The HEAVILY DISTORTED

sound of power chords blast out from an amplifier as
Phillip plays

Phillip’s playing is angry and sharp The chords follow
each other in rapid succession with increasing fervor

Phillip’s right hand becomes a blur Phillip flies the
crescendo The amplifier BLASTS a distorted flurry of
notes

The lights cut out

Unamplified Phillip’s high speed strumming sounds like
acoustic Spanish guitar The girl giggles

Phillip stops playing and looks up at the lights
PHILLIP
This wouldn’t happen in
Singapore

then Max The sound of the rain outside grows louder

INT KITCHEN - SAME

George Ricky and Max enter the kitchen The kitchen is
dark William is standing on top of a stainless steel
table He is unscrewing a light bulb George sees JB
standing on the floor near William

William takes the bulb from the socket and hands it to
JB Bulb in hand JB walks over to the stove and turns on
one of the gas burners

In front of the gas flame JB examines the bulb Someone
in the cafeteria is CRYING LOUDLY William gets off of
the table and walks over to George

GEORGE
What’s he doing

WILLIAM
He’s looking to see-

JB

George walks over to JB followed by the others

JB
(to George)

you and Max to help me take
the inmates back to their
rooms now

MAX
Not a chance

JB
It won’t take very long for
things to get nasty out there-
the sooner they’ re separated
the better

MAX
It’s not my job to deal with
these people

JB
This has nothing to do with
your job it’s about getting
control of a dangerous
situation

JB (contd)
The sooner we lock them into
their rooms the sooner I can
get to my office and call the
police

WILLIAM
I help

JB
Fine Come on

JB George and William walk over to the cafeteria door
JB turns to face them

JB

(continuing)
When you chaperone them keep
them in a single file line
George you walk at the front
William you walk at the back

(to George)
As you go read out the names
written on the open doors
They’11 go into their rooms and

(to William)
you lock them in when you walk
past
William nods
JB

If you still have someone with
you at the end of the hall
tell him that you’re gonna
bring him back to me for
disciplining Don’t worry
though it won’t come to that
most of the troublemakers will
be in my group Here

JB hands George a ring with two keys

JB
(continuing)
The round one gets you out of
the kitchen the square one
opens the door to hall B

GEORGE
Okay

JB unlocks the door They all walk through Ricky looks
at Max

RICKY
Do you think it’s dangerous
themout there

Max doesn’t hear Ricky’s question he is lost in his own
self-doubt and apprehensions

MAX
Do I smell like chickenshit or
just feel that way

RICKY
I wouldn’t have gone man

Max looks at Ricky He sees that Ricky is equally
worried

INT CAFETERIA — SAME

The cafeteria has two rows with very long benches and
tables Ten people sit on or walk about the benches

JB
Everyone listen

Six inmates give JB their undivided attention
It is not clear whether the others are listening

NERVOUS MAN
Where did the lights go

JB
They’1l be back on soon but
first we are going to take you
back to your rooms

NERVOUS
But we didn’t eat yet Who’re
they

JB

These two gentlemen are from
the kitchen and they are going
to help me take you back to
your rooms They are fully
authorized to discipline
anyone who acts out of line

George and William try to stand strong but look rather
intimidated by the prospect of disciplining anyone

George notices THUMB staring directly at him from the
corner of the room George awkwardly shifts his glance

NERVOUS
Who authorized them you

BALD MAN
He can’t do that sort of
thing on the spot like that
They need training Those
guys touch me and I’1ll scream

JB
Be quiet I’1ll take you
myself

One of the inmates starts LAUGHING LOUDLY

JB
(continuing)
Everyone in hall B get ina
line by the exit quickly
George and William are going
to take you back to your rooms

One by one men walk over to the exit door George looks
to the corner of the room at THUMB

THUMB does not move to get in line George is a little
relieved A total of five men one of which is the
NERVOUS man get in line at the exit

George and William look at each other for a moment a
moment where they communicate their anxiety and then
stuff it away

George walks over to the front of the line William
holds up the rear George takes a key and inserts it in
the door

GEORGE
Lets go

George walks through the door followed by the five
inmates and William

INT CORRIDOR — SAME

The narrow corridor like the cafeteria is nearly pitch
black One by one the seven men file in The door shuts
behind William William stealthily checks the knob
behind him so that no one can hear It is locked

NERVOUS
It locks automatically

The men walk across the linoleum floor towards a door at
the far end A giant letter “B” is painted in Orange
upon the door

NERVOUS
(continuing)
Cook is this you first time
in the nuthouse not including
the kitchen

They continue to walk George does not know whether he
should answer the man or not

NERVOUS
(continuing)

GEORGE
Yes
NERVOUS

Do you like it

They reach the door George inserts the key and tries to
turn it It doesn’t turn

NERVOUS
(continuing)
Do you like it

The SHORT man standing behind Nervous pushes him forward
Nervous falls to the ground George sees this but
continues jiggling the key in the lock Short kicks
nervous in the face

William steps up from the back of the line and grabs
Short by his arms

WILLIAM
Yo tengo

William looks down at Nervous His face is smeared with
blood

WILLIAM
(continuing under
his breath)

Mierda

George stops fidgeting with the key for a moment and
looks at William -

GEORGE
El es mal

Short surges forwards and kicks Nervous in the face
again his foot making contact with a grim CRUNCH

William pulls him away from the line

George yanks the key out and rushes to William

Nervous passes out face down in a puddle of his own blood
George and William hold Short to the wall

GEORGE
(continuing)
Stop it Now What’s your
name

Short says nothing His outward appearance is serene and
he does not struggle George takes off his belt

MAN IN LINE
James Harper

George wraps the belt around the wrists and waist of the
small man tightening it as much as possible

Nervous regains consciousness in a fit of coughing He
spits out most of his front teeth onto the linoleum

Nervous brings his hand over to his mouth He reaches
inside to feel what’s left George and William look
away but cannot help grimacing as they listen to the man
SPIT and COUGH

GEORGE
(not looking at
Nervous)
Can you stand

NERVOUS
(weakly)
Yeah

George returns to the front of the line holding Short by
the belt William returns to the rear

George places the key in the lock He jiggles it around
for another moment The door does not open

MAN IN LINE
Did JB give you the wrong key

George’s twisting pays off the stubborn lock acquiesces
George looks at Short who remains as serene as before

George looks at Nervous who is holding his bleeding face
in both hands

George looks at William William nods for them to
proceed

The line exits the corridor

INT - HALL B - SAME

Hall B is a longer corridor twice the width of the
previous one There are twelve doors aligning the
hallway five of which are ajar

The line of seven proceeds

George reaches the first open door He looks to a sheet
attached to the door

GEORGE
Frank Castina

A man enters the room from the line William locks the
door as they walk by

George reads another name without stopping the line’s
forwards momentum

GEORGE
(continuing)
Isaac Kistler

The NERVOUS man files in his room William locks the
door behind him

George looks at the next sheet He looks at James

George pushes the man inside leaving the belt around
him George shuts and locks the door himself

George reads the next sheet

over

The Naked Man stands again

The man runs past George and William towards the
entrance He tries the doorhandle It is locked

NAKED MAN
(continuing)
No no no no noOPEN I

George and William slowly approach the Naked Man The
man slams repeatedly into the door while clutching the
knob

GEORGE
Get back to your room Now

The man faces George and William

He charges at them

Upon impact they all collapse to the ground

The Man struggles George lays across his torso The
Man ineffectually strikes George’s upper back with his
open hands William bear-hugs the man’s legs in an
effort to stop his wild kicking

NAKED MAN
Get off off off

The man bites George’s shoulder

GEORGE
Fuck

George knees the Naked Man hard in the stomach The man
coughs and unclenches his teeth from George’s shoulder

George punches the man in the jaw The man’s struggle
grows more desperate

William lets go of the man’s legs and springs off of the
winded man

William kicks the man in the head again this time
harder The man continues to struggle arms and legs
wildly flailing
William kicks the man in the head again He passes out
George and William drag the Naked Man into his room
George shuts the door
William locks the door
George unbuttons his double-breasted chef shirt He
tries to look at his shoulder where he was bitten but
cannot quite see the wound

GEORGE

(continuing)
Am I bleeding

William looks closely at his shoulder
WILLIAM
No but you gots the big red
mark
George pulls his shirt back on THUNDER RUMBLES
They walk to the hall exitentrance
WILLIAM
(continuing)

George unlocks the door
INT CORRIDOR — MOMENTS LATER

George and William stand at the end of the corridor while
George unlocks the door

INT CAFETERIA —- MOMENTS LATER
George and William enter the cafeteria

The door to the kitchen is wide open One of the benches
lies overturned through the open doorway

William taps George on the shoulder and points to the
open door

WILLIAM
(whispered)
Miras

GEORGE
(whispered)
Miro miro I see

They stand still listening for something for anything
that might let them know what the situation is

They hear pouring RAIN They hear distant THUNDER
RUMBLING

George shuts the cafeteriacorridor door through which he
and William just passed He locks the door

GEORGE
(continuing)
Where the hell is JB

WILLIAM
Yo no se Que tu crees

THUNDER RUMBLES

GEORGE
I want-

Something SLAMS into the cafeteria door that George just
locked

WILLIAM
Yo quiero el cuchillo mio

GEORGE
I wouldn’t mind having my
knife either

The doorknob RATTLES in place as someone on the other
side tries to wrest it open

George and William stare at the rattling knob as it
wobbles in place

The person lets go the knob hangs still George and
William hear the sound of FOOTSTEPS receding

George and William cautiously approach the kitchen
INT KITCHEN - SAME

George and William step over the mangled bench and walk
inside

Someone is standing on top of the stove He is urinating
into a large stock pot

The MAN while still urinating turns his head to face
George and William who remain still and silent

George sees that the Man is holding a CLEAVER in his free
hand The Man finishes urinating and zips up

GEORGE
Hello Carter

Carter steps off of the stove He ignites the flame
under the pot he just urinated into

Carter walks straight towards George and William

George and William start to walk deeper into the kitchen
and out of the Carter’s trajectory The THUMPING starts
up again

Carter lunges at George and William They both freeze
with shock Carter stops two steps later

CARTER
said without humor)
Let me know what you think of
my cooking chef
He walks out of the door

GEORGE
Let’s barricade that door

WILLIAM
No tienes los llaves

GEORGE
No no keys

They walk towards the door

Carter reappears in the doorway and flings his cleaver at
the cooks

Both George and William flinch and cover their faces with
their hands

The blade misses them and caroms with a loud CLANK off of
one of the stainless steel tables and onto the floor

Carter is gone from the door
George and William race forward
GEORGE

(continuing)
Tienes la puerta
49

William pushes the bench outside and slams the door

while George rolls a large metal table up against it
They turn the table over on its side William pulls

another table against the first

George walks over to the stove and turns off the burner
that is below the urine filled pot

THUMP THUMP
GEORGE
(continuing)
It might be Max right

WILLIAM
Maybe En the pantry

George opens up a drawer and pulls out his chef knife
William does the same They walk over to the pantry

George knocks loudly on the door

GEORGE
Max

MAX (0S)
(muffled)
Open the goddamn door George

George pulls the door open Max walks out

MAX
Fucking door fucking locked on

George doesn’t respond Max is about to gripe some more
but sees that George and William are upset

MAX
(continuing)
Ricky hyperventilated when
they broke in

WILLIAM

GEORGE
How is he

MAX
He’s still breathing
irregularly but breathing

GEORGE
Well that’s at least something

MAX
By the way I fucking quit

goddamn paychecks
(noticing something)
Where’s JB

George looks at William They both shrug

MAX
(continuing)
Did he call the cops Youd
better not shrug again

GEORGE
We don’t know where he is
He’s supposed to be here But
he’s not

MAX
Keen observation you scientist

GEORGE
I would really appreciate you
going easy on the sarcasm for
a moment

Something SLAMS into the kitchencafeteria window

The three cooks look to the window Blood runs down the
glass in streaks from one circular splatter mark

Max runs over to the window Sporadic YELLING and
LAUGHTER can be heard

MAX
Shit
(beat)
There are a bunch of guys out
there

George walks over to the window

MAX
(continuing)
They’re picking up another
bench

GEORGE
Shit

George and Max dive away from the window

The glass shatters A catapulted bench comes sailing
clean through

The bench slams against the opposite wall and ricochets
down

George runs over to the door
GEORGE
(continuing to Max
and William)
Help me

George grabs one of the metal tables that is blocking the
door and pushes it out of the way

GEORGE
(continuing)
Away away clear it away
An arm holding a plastic tray reaches through the window
The arm chips away the edges of glass left within the
pane

William and Max grab the other table and similarly
discard it

A FIGURE starts to climb through the window

George opens the door

They all run through

INT CAFETERIA SAME

George Max and William erupt from the kitchen into the
cafeteria George and William hold their knives close in
as they run

A group of PEOPLE standing by the shattered
kitchencafeteria window turn to look at the running
group

The cooks speedily exit the cafeteria through the open
corridor door

INT CORRIDOR - SAME

William mocks Max’s recent vomiting episode

MAX
(half joking)
Well then fuck you and your
forty sisters in bunk beds

William starts to laugh The tension is broken Max
lightly punches William on the shoulder letting him know
that their quibble is quashed George is relieved

GEORGE
Let’s get to a phone we
should assume that they got to
JB before he was able to call
the cops

MAX
Where’s the phone

GEORGE
There’s definitely one in JB’s
office There might be
another one someplace else
but I’m not sure

MAX
Might as well go for the one
you’re sure about

GEORGE
I know he locks his office
though He might still have
the keys on his keychain

MAX
It looks like the nuts already
got a set of keys

GEORGE
I think that’s a different set
though They might not have
noticed his keychain with his
home and office keys

WILLIAM
Let’s go

GEORGE
I don’t know that we should
all go

MAX
Well I don’t want to sit in

WILLIAM
I don’t either

INT HALL A - MOMENTS LATER
George Max and William enter the hallway
An ELDERLY MAN walks out of the room opposite them

They continue walking purposefully not giving the man
their attention He watches them intently

ELDERLY MAN
When are we gonna get to eat

George turns momentarily to answer the man

GEORGE
Pretty soon OK

ELDERLY MAN
How much time

MAX
Fifteen minutes

ELDERLY MAN
Okay

The Elderly man turns back to his room

The cooks walk through the entrance
INT CORRIDOR - SAME

A foot-wide smear of blood runs from where the body was
to the cafeteria entrance door

MAX
Why the fuck would they want

George looks at the cafeteria entrance door
MAX
(continuing)
I’m not going in there No

GEORGE

I know I’m just trying to

The three men walk towards the HALL B door
It is open They walk through

INT HALL B —- SAME

George Max and William enter the hall

All of the doors are open A MAN walks across the hall
from one room to another

The three intrepidly proceed along the course

The door at the end of the hall is ajar

GEORGE
JB’s office is at the end of
the hall behind this door
(beat)
But this is usually locked

MAX
So they have the keychain

George pushes the door open a few more inches He peers
around the edge

GEORGE
Someone’s in the office It
looks like one of the nurses
though

MAX
Go c’mon

GEORGE
(to William)
Hide that thing

William takes off his cooking apron and wraps the blade
George places his knife in his apron and wraps it as well

One by one they exit HALL B
INT SMALL CORRIDOR — SAME

The tiny dark corridor has barely room enough to fit the
three cooks The door to JB’s office is open Inside
a MAN walks by the open door allowing the cooks only a
brief glance

NURSE (0S)
just wanted to clarify a
couple of things You
misunderstood me
(beat)
That’s unfair

GEORGE
(whispered)
I don’t recognize him but he
is wearing a nurse’s uniform

MAX
Well it sounds like the
phone’s working at least I
imagine we can overpower him
if we have to Let’s go

GEORGE
Let me find out what’s up
You stand right outside the
door

George walks into the office
INT JB’S OFFICE — SAME

The NURSE sits at the desk talking on the telephone The
room has a tiny window through which the pouring rain and
moonlight are somewhat visible The room has no other
doors

NURSE
Listen babybabywhoa

George walks in The Nurse does not look up George
gently KNOCKS on the open door The Nurse looks up

NURSE
(continuing into the
phone)
Hold on
(to George)
You’re one of the cooks right

GEORGE
Have you called the police

NURSE
(into the phone)
I’1l1 call you back baby Bye
(hangs up the phone)
Now what were you saying

GEORGE
They killed JB It’s complete
chaos out there did you call
the cops

NURSE
I didn’t know about the murder
until just now how could I
have called the cops

GEORGE
About the power being out you
didn’t call them to come and
fix it

NURSE
Why would I call the police
about that

GEORGE
Cause we’re locked in an
asylum with the criminally
insane

The Nurse stands up out of his seat

NURSE
Don’t yell at me

GEORGE
Let me call

George notices that the Nurse is not wearing shoes The
Nurse’s pants are too short as well

The Nurse catches George looking at his feet
The Nurse yanks the cord from the phone
The nurse lifts the entire phone with his left hand

NURSE
I should kill you

GEORGE
Guys

The Nurse hurls the phone at George It SMACKS him
square in the face Max and William enter the room The
Nurse backs to the far wall

MAX
(staring directly at
the Nurse)
You OK George

George GRUNTS a not too believable affirmative William
looks at George George is bleeding from both nostrils
An airborne stapler catches Max right in the chest
Max runs at the Nurse
MAX
(continuing)

Cocksucker
The Nurse pushes a chair in Maxs path
William pulls out his knife

Max stumbles over the chair but is up in the same
instant

The Nurse reaches for something else to throw Max wraps
his hands around the Nurse’s neck

MAX
(continuing)
Fucker

The Nurse coughs and swings at Max catching him in the
ribs Unflinchingly Max slams the Nurse’s head into the
wall The Nurse kicks frantically stomps on Maxs foot
Max SLAMS the Nurses head into the wall again and again

A weak moan escapes the Nurse’s mouth before Max lets him
drop unconscious to the ground

Max spits on the fallen nurse and kicks him in the
stomach

Max’s shoulders rise and fall with each adrenalized
breath

MAX
(continuing)
Fucking nutcase

The Nurse lies completely still upon the floor

MAX
(continuing)
These guys should’ ve been
gassed and electrocuted Ail

friend’s mental state but doesn’t know what to say He
looks over at William William remains focused on the
hallway outside

red circle of blood has appeared at the center It grows
larger and larger as the unstaunchable bloodflow seeps
through the many layers of cloth

The door flies into George resoundingly smacking against
his head George passes out

INT KITCHEN - LATER

George is completely naked He is tied to an overturned
steel table His arms are tied behind his back his legs
are fettered by string and tape and his head is taped to
the table leg His face and body are glistening with
sweat

He spits blood and something more solid out of his mouth
onto the floor He tries to see what it is but cannot
quite get an angle on it

George looks straight ahead of him He is facing the
even George looks up All of the burners on the stove
are blazing on high

George looks to the left of him as far as his restraints
will allow him The floor is covered with strewn garbage

George sees JB’s headless body sitting propped up against
another table His body has been positioned Indian
sitting style The earlier mentioned animal skull (calf
or goat) rests in the headless man’s lap

George looks to his right Thumb stands two feet away
staring at him while sucking his thumb

GEORGE
You’re Harry Green

Thumb does not react nor respond The look on Thumb’s
face is more inquisitive than menacing Thumb pulls his
finger from his mouth

GEORGE
(continuing)
The cops will be here any
minute

Thumb kneels down and faces George eye to eye Thumb
stares at George’s mouth

GEORGE
(continuing)
They can try you again if-

Thumb brushes the index finger of his left hand along
George’s lips George winces

Thumb places his other hand on George’s forehead
pressing his skull even more firmly to the steel pole
George tries to shake him off but Thumb holds him
steadfast

Thumb takes his index finger and pushes George’s upper
lip up revealing his teeth and gums George tries to
bite him Thumb calmly mashes the palm of his hand into
George’s already broken nose Blood runs down his face
George grunts holding back his scream while tears well
up in his eyes

Thumb lifts George’s lip up again George does not
resist

Thumb runs his finger along George’s teeth Thumb stands
up George watches him walk away

George hears a dragging sound

A MAN walks in front of George holding a large chef’s
knife

GEORGE

to George’s leg

causing the knife to slice into him Pete lifts the
blade away

GEORGE

Pete brings the blade over to George’s leg He rests it
on his leg at an angle

PETE
Hold still

Pete glides the blade gently along George’s oiled leg

He pulls the blade away and wipe George’s hair off of it
He rests the blade back on George’s leg and continues to
shave him

GEORGE
Look at me you goddamn

Pete pauses for a moment but does not look up

GEORGE
(continuing)
Don’t do this

Pete wipes the hair off of the blade Pete looks to
George’s other leg He brings the blade to rest on
George’s thigh skin He continues shaving George with
methodical care The angled blade riding over George’s
skin-

GEORGE
(continuing)
Shit

Pete jerks the knife away from George’s leg He has
accidentally opened another wound on Georges shin

GEORGE
(continuing)
Why are you doing this

Pete doesn’t answer He raises the blade to George’s
right arm and begins to shave his forearm

GEORGE
(continuing)
What are they going to do to
me

Pete pauses again He starts to lift his head up to face
George but stops before their eyes meet George can see
that Pete is terrified Pete looks down

He finishes shaving George’s right arm and wipes the hair
from his blade George is trying to get inside of Pete’s
mind any way that he can

GEORGE
(continuing)
They murdered Max and Ricky
And JB They were always nice
to you And so was I

Pete trembles briefly and brings the steel away from
George Pete looks at George directly Pete’s eyes are
glassy with restrained tears

PETE

I’d kill you if I had the
courage

GEORGE
Just stall for time The cops

An instrument lands on the floor next to George’s feet
George looks at it for a long moment before he realizes
what it is It is a potato peeler

Pete reaches over George handing the knife to the unseen
Man THUNDER RUMBLES Pete picks up the peeler He
brings it to George’s left arm He rest it against
George’s skin George shuts his eyes and grits his teeth
with terrible anticipation

Pete slides the peeler down George’s arm gently and
slowly Pete then feels George arm

PETE
(to the Man)
It isn’t working

MAN (0S)
Stupid idiot You have to do

The Man walks into George’s view It is Martin one of
the inmates that he and William locked up earlier

GEORGE
Martin right Your name is

MARTIN
(to Pete)
Go ‘head Try it Petey

Pete presses the peeler hard to George’s skin

GEORGE
Pete DON’T

Pete slashes downwards with the peeler He peels a wide
red swatch down the length of George’s arm

George screams hysterically Pete averts his gaze from
the horribly suffering man before him

MARTIN

Pete brings the peeler back to George’s arm He gently
shaves George’s skin with short abrupt movements Hair
is coming off

INT KITCHEN — MOMENTS LATER

Pete pulls the peeler from Georges chest Three red
marks bleed on George’s chest At this point George is
too exhausted to yell

Pete stands up and walks away George looks around him
The fires burn high He bleeds from a dozen lacerations
He shines with blood oil and sweat

Pete returns holding a tin can in his hand and an opener
in the other He begins opening the can

George looks at Pete’s face Pete looks numbed by the
goings-on He finishes opening the can and discards the
top

Pete looks at George’s face He places the can on the
ground Pete gets up and walks away

George hears the sound of a FAUCET RUNNING
Pete returns holding a cooking apron dripping water

PETE
Here

Pete leans over to George and wipes his face He wipes
away the blood from under his nose He wipes the crusted
oil and tears from his cheeks He places the apron on
George’s forehead

George shuts his eyes and momentarily savors the the
simple pleasure of the cool cloth against his head

Pete tosses the towel away He picks up the can He
reaches in and withdraws a dark purplishred beet He
rests the can on the floor

Pete brings the beet to George’s lips He forcefully
rubs the beet back and forth staining George’s lips with
the beet’s deep hue Pete rubs the beet similarly on
George’s left cheek Then his right THUNDER RUMBLES
Pete puts the beet back in the can

Pete looks at George George looks back with the
clownish face of smeared crimson makeup

PETE
(continuing)
I’m sorry

George has nothing to say Pete leaves

George looks to his left JB is still seated Indian
style The animal’s head seems to stare at George from
the headless man’s lap

Two Men walk over to the oven containing Max One
reaches for the handle George shuts his eyes tight

MAN (0S)
He’s still alive

OTHER MAN (0S)
No he’s not

They walk away

GEORGE
(continuing)
Please

George hears a light BANG from the inside of the oven

George body shakes to cry but his eyes have dried out
He opens his mouth to yell but he can’t fill his lungs
with air

The door to the oven slowly begins to open George
thrashes about like a cold fish on hot coals THUNDER
RUMBLES

His wrists bleed but the cord does not loosen

The door to the oven thumps shuts Another feeble rap
comes from within George jerks and convulses

GEORGE
(continuing faintest
whisper)

Max

The tape around George’s head rips loose In his mad
thrashings George pounds his head into the steel leg that
he is tied to

George passes out

INT KITCHEN - LATER

George wakes up screaming Pete is kneeling in front of
him Pete pulls his arms away from George’s crotch

George sees that Pete is holding a pair of poultry shears
(scissors) in his hand

George does not look down between his legs- he shuts his
eyes and tries to scream to cry-

Weak sounds come to George’s mouth
MAN’S VOICE (0S)

Thumb Looks at George with a saddemed gaze He seems to
pity George

GEORGE
What What do you want

Thumb discards the container He stands up and walks
over to George

George no longer has the capacity to struggle though his
face still expresses fear

Thumb kneels down in front of George

Georges entire body begins to shake with terror

Thumb puts his hand on Georges face and caresses him
softly George holds his breath as pain and apprehension
war with his nerves

Thumb lies down next to George resting the back of his
head against Georges leg

George watches Thumb but does nothing

Thumb shuts his eyes George breathes in deeply

Thumb falls asleep

Everything is silent in the kitchen other than the slow
light breathing of Thumb and the louder labored
breathing of George

George stares at the fires blazing on the stovetops
Georges eyelids grow heavy with exhaustion

vomits all over himself HISSSSSS

George doesnt struggle nor does he call out to anyone

Thumb curled up at Georges side convulses several
times Thumb urinates on himself His grip on Georges
leg becomes tighter

Georges breathing becomes more and more forced often
cut off by gagging and coughing

WHAM George slams his head against the steel pole of
the table while his awkwardly bucking body twists into
obtuse angles

Thumb thrown clear of George puts his fingers into his
mouth and bites down HISSSSSS

WHAM George slams his head into the pole WHAM
George is SCREAMING

hair eyelashes and eyebrows

forward holding a large key in his hand

George takes the key
GEORGE
(continuing)

The Unknown Mans hair begins to grow out inches per
second

mass

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - LATE

George watches television

There is a KNOCK on the door

GEORGE
Yes

FEMALE VOICE (0S)
It’s me

George picks up the remote control and turns the
television off

GEORGE
Come in

The door opens Lynn stands apprehensively at the
doorway holding a bundle of flowers She looks at
George

George does not look at her but stares disinterestedly
at the window She bites her lip in an effort not to
gasp George continues to stare at the window

GEORGE
(continuing)
Let me know when you are
through being shocked

LYNN
You look better than I thought
you would

George looks at her Her lip trembles She bites down
harder

Lynn awkwardly walks towards the bed She kisses George
She then looks around the room nervously

LYNN
(continuing)
Where should I put these

Lynn raises the flowers

GEORGE
They’re nice Thank you
Uhthere

(indicating sink area)

Lynn walks over to the sink The moment her back is to
George she wipes tears from her eye

Lynn takes an empty water glass fills it partly and puts
the flowers inside Lynn turns back to George

GEORGE
(continuing)
How were the funerals last
week

LYNN
Terrible but everyone wished
you well

GEORGE
That’s nice

George looks at Lynn in a prying manner She seems very
defensive

LYNN
What

GEORGE
Say what’s on your mind

LYNN
You know what it is I wanted
to be here for you To help
you To hold you You
wouldn’t let me
(beat)
Why

GEORGE
Every night I wake up
sweatingcryingI-
I have this dreamthis
nightmare again and again

Lynn looks on with a pitying gaze but with nothing to
say

GEORGE

(continuing)
Ive never had nightmares
before- none that I could
remember anyways- but I have
the same nightmare over and
over again I dream that I
was able to save them

( finding it a little

hard to continue )
and when I wake up I
realize that I didntthat
I wasnt able to save them
Over and over again

(beat)
They die every time I wake up
Two times a night three times
night Sometimes more

LYNN
I want to help you through
this

GEORGE
I piss out of a plastic straw
I piss in my sleep- when I can
even get to sleep My life is
ruined Lynn Completely
ruined

(beat)

This is nothing anyone can
help me with

LYNN
You’re wrong George

GEORGE
Shut up Would you please
listen to me and just shut up

Lynn is taken aback by George’s edginess but does her
best not to fuel the fire

GEORGE
(continuing)
I think about it constantly
Everytime a light turns off
everytime a meal is put in
front of me everytime I think
about my two closest friends

LYNN
(through tears)
Oh my God George You’re not
thinking about
(hesitates)
«-about suicide are you

George thinks about the question put to him He is not
sure how to answer

GEORGE
No Lynn

LYNN
You need help it’1ll get
better

GEORGE
You say that because you
weren’t there and because you
don’t understand

(beat)

I feel like my thoughts have
cancer My life was ruined
Lynn

GEORGE (contd)
When I hear someone say “it’ll
get better” I want to laugh at
how stupid that sounds

Lynn is speechless

GEORGE
(continuing)
I know you care but you can’t
do anything

Lynn walks up to George and puts her hand to his face
She puts her trembling index finger on George’s lip

GEORGE
(continuing)
Stop it

Lynn jerks her hand away as if she had just touched a
hot iron

GEORGE
(continuing)
Please leave

Lynn walks away utterly shell-shocked She opens the
door and exits without looking back

George thinks about Lynn’s visit for a moment He feels
that it amounted to nothing

George pulls the plasma tube from his arm He walks over
to the door He shuts it He locks it

George picks up the remote control and points it at the
television He turns the television on He presses the
volume button The TV grows louder and louder and
louder

George grabs the end rail of his bed He tightly grips
the metalwork frame

He shakes back and forth He lowers his head into his
pillow

PHILLIP

In France

The garage door begins its slow climb
Phillip stares ahead at the door He grows a bit morose
INT GARAGESTUDIO —- LATER

The three musicians are rocking hard Distortion mounts
and reverberates in the studio Robert works the knobs

In mid jam the bassist and drummer look at Phillip
Phillip mouths the word three

Phillip mouths the word two

Phillip mouths the word one

Phillip and the bassist kick their distortion pedals
The electronic fuzz disappears

Unamplified the guitarist’s high speed strumming sounds
like acoustic Spanish guitar- like on the night of the
power failure

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

Lynn and the Doctor are in the room

They stare out of the open window down towards the
ground simultaneously shocked and dismayed
