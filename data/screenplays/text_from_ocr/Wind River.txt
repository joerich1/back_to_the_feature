WIND RIVER

Written by

Taylor Sheridan
OPEN ON
SNOW COVERS AN ENDLESS PLAIN ON A MOONLESS NIGHT

Clumps of sagebrush huddled together like angry gnomes are
the only evidence of life in this place

There is no movement

No sound

Until

The sound of FEET CRUSHING SNOW Moving toward us Fast
A GIRL RUNS PAST US -- SCREAMING

She’s in her late teens wearing a baby blue down-filled
coat White sweat pants She runs as though her life depends
on it Which it does

GIRL’S VOICE (VO)
There is a meadow in my perfect
world Where wind dances the
branches of a tree casting leopard
spots of light across the face of a
pond

ANGLE ON

BARE FEET slamming frozen earth Blood staining the snow with
every step

GIRL’S VOICE (VO)
The tree stands tall and grand and
alone shading the world beneath
it

WE RUN BESIDE HER

We take in her pretty face as she sobs heaves in air
stumbles and falls out of frame

GIRL’S VOICE (VO)
There will come a day when I rest
against its spine and look out over
a valley where the sun warms but
never burns

She rises blood drips into her eye from an unseen wound
Takes off again and somehow runs faster -- screams whipping
behind her like a cape
GIRL’S VOICE (VO)
I will watch leaves turn Green
then amber then crimson Then no
leaves at all

The faster she runs the farther the horizon moves from her
As if the earth is tilting to prevent this girl from reaching
her destination

GIRLS VOICE (VO)
But the tree will not die For in
this place winter never comes
It is here in the cradle of all I
hold dear I guard every memory of
you

She finds her stride Crying less Running harder Gaining
momentum Pulling away from us Getting down to the business
of surviving

GIRLS VOICE (V0)
And when I find myself frozen in
the mud of the real -- far from
your loving eyes I will return to
this place close mine and take
solace in the simple perfection of
knowing you

WE WATCH FROM A DISTANCE Her white pants match the snow her
black hair matches the night -- all we can see is a baby-blue
coat that floats above the plains like a wayward balloon
bouncing above a white desert

CUT TO

EXT HIGHWAY 789 -- CENTRAL WYOMING -- DAWN

Yellow lines whip beneath us The faded blacktop is a gray
blur as we chew road

To our left is an ocean of sage brush and dirty snow
sprawled out before the towering WIND RIVER MOUNTAIN RANGE

A PICK UP TRUCK makes its way down a deserted highway On the
door is an OFFICIAL SEAL and the letters USFWS

THE UNITED STATES FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE

INT PICK UP TRUCK -- CONTINUOUS

A MAN grips the steering wheel Sips coffee from a travel
mug He’s around 40 Sunken cheeks Mustache
Cowboy hat on his head Almost white when it was new --
sweat dirt and who knows what else have stained the hat
brown and robbed it of its shape

A fair description of the man as well

Through the windshield we see a dirt road that meets the
black top The truck slows turns onto it

EXT SAGEBRUSH PRAIRIE -- DAY

FIVE HUNDRED SHEEP wander through snow in a futile search for
something to eat

In the distance we see TWO COYOTES They duck behind the
sagebrush then reappear seventy-five yards closer only to
disappear again

Farther to the flock’s left THREE MORE COYOTES approach at a
trot They see no need for stealth -- these sheep have
nowhere to go

The sheep spot the killers approaching and huddle into a
tight circle -- with the rams forming an outer layer of
protection

If coyotes could laugh they would laugh at this

The two wary coyotes however make no attempt to approach
They raise their noses to the air -- sucking in the wind’s
secrets And just like that they disappear

The other three move eagerly toward their lunch

THUNDER SHAKES THE VERY EARTH

One of the coyotes is blown backwards cart-wheeling through
the snow

The other two stop

MORE THUNDER A second coyote is driven into the ground like
he’s been hit with a giant hammer

The last coyote turns and runs for the safety of anywhere but
here

WIDEN TO REVEAL --
The man dressed completely in white lays prone -- invisible

in the snow A rifle pressed to his shoulder He works the
bolt -- chambers another round
WE SEE THE LAST COYOTE THROUGH A RIFLE SCOPE

The cross-hairs find the back of the coyote’s head bouncing
in and out of view The scope begins to move with it The
rifle invades the silence again When the muzzle flash
disappears we see the coyote splayed out in the snow

In the distance the two coyotes wise enough to never trust
the scent of man crest a far rise and drop out of view

The sheep shriek in terror as they run around in a giant
panicked pointless circle

The man rises and walks toward the carnage he inflicted

The flock runs right toward the man who doesn’t stop
Doesn’t even look in their direction

The flock almost runs into him before dividing and passing
him on either side They rejoin and continue their silly
circle -- all instinct for survival bred out of them

EXT SAGEBRUSH PRAIRIE -- DAY

The man looks at the dead coyotes with no emotion He removes
a rope from a backpack Begins looping the rope around the
back feet of a coyote then moves to another and does the
same

All three are now tethered together and he begins the chore
of dragging them through the snow and red dirt

He drags them past the flock which stands idly by panting
like tired dogs

His dark eyes hold no joy No sorrow either This is not
sport This is his job This is CORY LAMBERT

CUT TO

INT PICK UP TRUCK -- DAY

Cory warms his free hand against the truck’s vent Grabs his
coffee Takes a sip The coffee’s cold Doesn’t matter -- not
his first cold cup of coffee He stares at the road If the
truck had a radio that worked he’d turn it on
EXT BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT FIELD OFFICE -- DAY

BLM OFFICER TIM WINTER late 30’s big coat bigger cowboy
hat stands beside USFWS ENFORCEMENT AGENT DALE BERTRAM
early 30s They stare at the coyotes in the bed of Corey’s
truck

TIM
Did you see Wyman’s sheep dogs near
the flock

CORY
Nope

TIM
Told me he had six dogs watching
over it

CORY
He don’t have six dogs anymore
Those coyotes moved on that flock
like they’ve been doing it all
month

TIM
Buggers are bad this year We’ll be
lucky if there’s a flock of sheep
standing come April

Tim looks to the STORM CLOUDS that loom over the WIND RIVER
MOUNTAIN RANGE like a reckoning

TIM (CONTD)
After this storm I want you up in
a chopper Those mutt’s will be
easy to spot with a coat of fresh
snow When can your boy fly Dale

DALE
We’1ll see what kind of wind follows
the storm Maybe Wednesday

He looks at Cory

DALE (CONT’D)
I got a call from BIA Police the
chief was asking for you A
mountain lion’s working through the
flocks east of Boulder Flats

Tim can’t help but laugh
TIM
You’d think folks would learn this
isn’t sheep country

They all laugh at that

DALE
Tore up a horse and some weanlings
too

CORY

That sounds like wolves

DALE
Chief says it’s a cat and they
ain’t had no luck getting it I
offered Kenny and his hounds but
they don’t want a white man running
around on the rez with a firearm

CORY
They don’t want a white man out
there period I’1l call him

TIM
I forget you’re part Indian

CORY
Well I’m Indian enough to do
favors but not enough to pull a
check

DALE
Be careful out there Half those
boys are tweaked out of their
minds

Cory doesn’t answer

TIM
Shit that junk’s everywhere now
I’m scared to let my daughter leave
the house

As soon as Tim says it he wishes he could have it back
Everyone looks to the ground To the mountains To the storm
hovering Anywhere but Cory who stares at the coyotes’
corpses in the bed of his truck Lifeless eyes stare back

CORY
I gotta go
DALE
Okay Drop those off at Fish and
Game

CORY
Yep

He climbs in his truck and starts it in one fluid motion He
pulls toward the road as the coming storm inches closer

INT CORY’S PICK UP -- LANDER WYOMING -- DAY

Cory drives through the town of Lander Feed stores fast
food and a Wall Mart pass by his window He turns on a side
street and pulls up to a small house Parks Gets out

EXT WILMA LAMBERT’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Cory walks up the driveway past a faded Silver Subaru
Reaches the door Rings the bell

The door opens and WILMA LAMBERT 38 full blood Shoshoni
gives Cory a terse smile

She was a beauty two kids and many heartaches ago but bad
food and cigarettes are winning the war against her looks
Still effort went into her hair and make-up was delicately
applied

WILMA
You got blood on your shirt

CORY
I was at work

She nods but doesn’t approve

WILMA
Who was the victim today

Cory knows her well enough to sense her moods and apparently
she’s in one right now

CORY
Looks like it’s gonna be me

She stares at him Her face goes from anger to pity to tired
in an instant She waves him in
WILMA
Want some coffee

He doesn’t but

CORY
Sure Thank you

He steps in removing his hat

INT WILMA LAMBERT’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

It is exactly what you would expect from a prefab home owned
by a woman with good taste and no money The place is
spotless Mismatched Lazy Boys and outdated furniture are
thoughtfully arranged

Wilma disappears into the kitchen leaving Cory alone in the
living room

He stares at the ground Fumbles with his hat Looks at the
ceiling fan Gives up and turns his gaze toward the
fireplace

Above the mantle is a 16x24 FRAMED YEARBOOK PHOTOGRAPH of a
TEENAGE GIRL She wears a basketball uniform Black hair
neatly braided into long pig-tails Big smile Bright eyes
His eyes

Sage bundles Sweetgrass braids and an eagle feather are
arranged around it It is a shrine

Wilma returns Hands him a mug He nods his appreciation

CORY
I gotta go to the Rez tomorrow
thought I’d take Casey by your
folks

She winces at the word ‘Rez’ then nods at the word ‘folks’

WILMA
Something killed a yearling in the
pasture behind their house

CORY
That’s why I’m going

WILMA
Probably one of those Littlefeather
demons They stole two of Daddy’s
calves last spring
CORY
Mountain lion wolf or demon
child they want me to find it

Beat

WILMA
Don’t let Casey out of your sight
on the Rez okay

CORY
I was gonna leave him with your
folks while I scouted Too cold to
drag him through the snow

WILMA
You know what I mean

Cory seems to make eye contact with her for the first time

CORY
Yeah I do And I won’t

Beat

Cory sips his coffee Then yells down the hall

CORY (CONTD)
CASEY

CASEY
DAD OKAY I’M COMING

Appearing in the hall and bumbling toward Cory is CASEY
LAMBERT 8 years old Olive skin and short black hair
covered by a weathered cowboy hat very similar to Cory’s
Though the skin and hair are darker this is clearly Cory’s
son

The boy labors toward his dad with suitcase sleeping bag
coat and BB gun in a noisy clumsy ball of energy

CORY
What did I tell you about pointing
that BB gun at people

Casey freezes Drops everything but the gun

CASEY
Sorry dad
CORY
Being careless won’t get you
anywhere faster

CASEY
No sir

CORY
Put the BB gun in the truck then
come back for the rest

CASEY
Yes sir

He begins running for the door

CORY
Don’t run with it

Slows to an urgent walk Pushes through the screen

WILMA
Ill be back Monday afternoon

CORY
Watch yourself on the road

WILMA
He doesn’t need to be missing
school to go chasing coyotes with
you

CORY
We’ll get all the chase out of our
system tomorrow You be careful

WILMA
This won’t be my first snow storm
in a car

Beat
Cory walks over to Casey’s things
WILMA (CONTD)

Let him Needs to learn to do
things for himself

Cory grabs his things anyway

CORY
I agree but I’ve stood here as
long as I care to Hope the
interview goes well in Jackson

door

LU
il

WILMA
Yep We’ll see

CORY
If anyone was born to make a living
talking on the phone

She takes the jab as one of affection which it was

CORY (CONT’D)
It’s a good school over there Good
town

She nods

WILMA
If I get the job we’re gonna have
to talk about his child support --
Jackson’s a lot more expensive

CORY
Get the job We’1l get the rest
figured You got my word

Whatever happened to these two they are unified in their
desire to find a better life for their son

He pushes the screen door open Looks back at her
CORY (CONT’D)
Take Togwotee Pass Don’t go
through Pinedale Storm’s coming
from the south
Wilma’s eyes go dark
WILMA
You couldn’t drag me through
Pinedale with a rope I’1l never
set foot in that town again

He nods without agreeing then pushes through the door

INT CORY’S PICK UP -- DAY
Casey looks at his father then at the coming storm

CASEY
She’s gonna be a bad one

Cory hides a smile at Casey’s attempt to speak like a man
Looks at his son -- a miniature if darker version of him
Looks at his hat -- beaten and filthy just like his

LZ

CORY
You just got that at Christmas

CASEY
It’s taken a beating just like a
hat should

CORY

Doing what You’ve only had the
thing two months

CASEY
I’m in the 4-H barn three times a
week
Cory draws in a breath to reprimand Looks at his boy -- so
desperate to please -- and swallows it Gives wisdom instead
CORY

Life dirties things plenty fast on
its own don’t need any help from
you

Casey stares at the floorboard Gives a submissive nod as the
excitement of a weekend with dad drains from him He looks
out the window as the outskirts of town fade into frozen
fields

Cory regrets saying anything at all

CORY (CONT’D)
Hey

Casey looks up
CORY (CONTD)

When we get home I’1ll help you

dust that hat up the right way

Okay
The tiniest of smiles crosses Casey’s face
Through the windshield we see storm clouds black as the
coming night push against the mountains that contain them

EXT CORY LAMBERT’S PLACE -- DUSK

Beside a small house is a corral Four horses huddle
together asses to the wind wishing like hell it was spring

Cory and Casey emerge from an old barn carrying hay Cory
flips a latch and swings the gate open snapping the horses
from their stupor

The horses head straight for Casey -- RIPPING HAY FROM HIS
BUNDLE

Cory tosses his hay bale in a trough then turns back to
Casey

CORY
Push their nose when they rub up on
you like that

Casey pushes one horse as another reaches over his head and
grabs more hay whipping Casey in the face when it does
knocking him down

Cory steps up and all the horses hurry toward the trough
like a high school fight breaking up when the principal
arrives

Cory looks at his son who has no hay left to hold He sits
on the ground -- face coat and hat covered in shredded
alfalfa and horse slobber

CORY (CONTD)
Told’ya I’d get that hat dirty

CASEY
They got the height advantage on me
is the deal

CORY
We can fix that

Cory smiles Most kids would’ve been terrified but Casey
stood his ground

Cory walks up behind Casey lifts him and sets him on a liver-
colored mare that is far too busy eating to care about the
boy now on her back

CORY (CONT’D)
Remember what I showed you

CASEY
But she’s eating

CORY
You want that horse to be yours
some day prove it Not to me to
her

Casey lets out a breath Grabs a handful of mane and pulls
back slightly The mare raises her head but doesn’t move

CORY (CONT’D)
Put those boots into the front of
her chest

He kicks into her She bolts up Casey grabs on tight

CORY (CONTD)
I didn’t say kick Ask her before
you tell her Just press your boots
into her chest Gentle

He does and the mare backs up

CORY (CONTD)
Ease up on the mane and give her a
little nudge in the ribs

He does The mare obeys and moves forward

CORY (CONT’D)
Wherever you look is where she
goes Take her to the gate

Casey stares at the gate with the focus of a surgeon

CORY (CONTD)
Get alongside and open it

Casey sends cues through his feet and negotiates the mare
parallel to the fence He reaches down to the latch

Casey wrestles with the latch his father flipped without
effort He struggles

CORY (CONTD)
Freezes up quick don’t it Give
it a good hit

Casey curls his fist and pounds the lever The gate swings
open Cory pulls Casey off and sets him on the ground facing
the mare

CORY (CONT’D)
Let her know you

Casey stands in front of her The mare inches closer
pressing her nostril to Casey’s nose inhaling his exhaled
breath

CORY (CONT’D)
Put a hand to her face Gentle
like a friend
1D

He does Then looks back at his father all smiles once
again

CASEY
That was pretty cowboy huh

CORY
No son That was Arapahoe

Cory closes the gate and they walk to the little house as the
mare hangs her head over the fence watching the boy --
forgetting the meal so important a moment ago

INT CORY’S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Cory and Casey sit on the couch Casey eats a sandwich and
stares at the TV Cory looks over A TOPO MAP as he speaks on
the phone

CORY
Yeah I’m looking at it There’s
drill rigs over there lions don’t
like the noise You sure it’s
something and not somebody
Alright I’11l check it out in the
morning If you got lions I’m
gonna have to bring Kenny’s hounds
in to run ‘em Name a Indian
with lion hounds and I’1l1 use him
Call you if I find anything

Cory hangs up Looks at his son lost in the television
Little mouth chewing little bites stopping for a little sip
of soda

Cory watches him Smiles Sits back quietly The smile
disappears Worry replaces it

Above the fireplace is the same photograph of a teenage girl
dressed to shoot hoops though much smaller Cory stares at
the photo then back to his son -- who is staring right at
him

Casey smiles then returns to the TV

Cory rubs his eyes Pinches the bridge of his nose Hard
Forcing emotion to retreat to wherever emotion comes from

CUT TO
io

INT CORY LAMBERT’S HOUSE -- CASEY’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

The door creaks open A shadow slinks in Sits on the edge of
the bed

A hand reaches out and rests gently on Casey’s chest

CORY
Hey

The sheets move a little

CORY (CONT’D)
Come on Wake up son We gotta go

Casey bolts upright

CASEY
I’M UP

The shadow rises walks to the door Turns on the light
CORY
I’m making breakfast Get dressed
We gotta feed the horses

Casey rubs furiously at his eyes and yawns

CASEY
Waiting on you

CORY
(Smiles)Yeah I can see that

Cory walks out as Casey rises shaking off the night

CUT TO

INT CORY’S PICK UP -- PRE-DAWN

Cory sips coffee As they drive down the highway PRONGHORN
ANTELOPE walk parallel to the road Following a path carved
into these plains before man sparked his first fire

INT CORY’S PICK UP -- DAWN
The sun has crested the horizon behind us Ahead of us -- the

Wind River mountains and the storm clouds that gather above
them
CASEY
How come the clouds just sit there
Why don’t they dump their snow and
get it over with

CORY
Mountains hold the clouds back with
the winds that blows between ‘em
Makes a sort of suction Sometimes
they can suck the storm right out
of the clouds Sometimes they just
make it worse cuz a big storm will
sit there and gather strength from
the winds that hold it back Our
ancestors believed the storms hold
the spirits of vengeance and the
mountains are our protector But
when enough evil lives in our
people the mountains free the
storm to punish the demons among
us

CASEY
That what you believe

Cory smiles

CORY
No

Beat

CORY (CONTD)
Sometimes

Up ahead we see a small log cabin with a barn even worse
off than Cory’s TWO HORSES run and kick at the dropping
pressure and the storm behind it Cory drives up and parks

The front door is already open An Indian man in his 70s
stands in long johns and boots with no regard for the sub-
zero temperature This is DAN CROWHEART Casey’s grandfather

CORY (CONT’D)
(Re the horses) Sense the storm

CROWHEART
Yep That’s my cue to stick ‘em in
the barn But with a lion about I
don’t want ‘em stuck in a open
stall They gonna have to make
their peace with the storm (Opening
his arms) Come here grandson
Ld

Casey is already doing that He runs to him and the old man
lifts him with a strength we didn’t credit him with having

CROWHEART (CONT’D)
You’re Grandma made fry bread You
have breakfast

CASEY
Just eggs

CROWHEART
Go get some then

Casey disappears inside Crowheart looks to Cory

CROWHEART (CONT’D)
Hau Munape

CORY
Yep

CROWHEART
Police chief called you to hunt the
lion eh

CORY
He called me to hunt something You
lost a steer

CROWHEART
I’1l show you where It’s a lion

He grabs a coat from a rack and steps outside They walk
behind the house past the horses and toward a large fenced
field completely covered in snow

CROWHEART (CONT’D)
How’s Wilma

CORY
Headed to a job interview in
Jackson Some hotel

CROWHEART
Jackson Hole Gonna go live with
the millionaires

CORY
What are you talking about
billionaires chased out the
millionaires years ago

Crowheart looks back as he walks and smiles
iv

CROWHEART
Save your money When the wolves
start eating their Golden
Retrievers that land’s gonna go
for pennies on the dollar

Cory laughs Crowheart stops THE SNOW IS STAINED RED Just
beyond is the body of a young steer Crowheart stands over it
and points to tracks in the hard snow

CROWHEART (CONTD)
Tell me what that is

Cory lowers himself to it Must admit --

CORY
That’s a lion

Cory follows the tracks Crowheart stays put watching
Fifty yards away Cory stops Looks back at Crowheart

CROWHEART
There’s two

He follows the tracks farther

CORY
Three She’s got both of last
year’s kits with her They chased
your steer around for a while I
bet

CROWHEART
That’s what the tracks say

Cory walks back toward him

CORY
She’s teaching them to hunt And
she’s teaching ‘em on livestock
(Shakes his head) She just got her
whole family killed

Cory looks toward the mountains From here they tower over
us like a canyon wall

CORY (CONT’D)
They’re tucked up there somewhere
I’1l go have a look You mind
watching Casey for a few hours

Crowheart smiles
CROWHEART
You never have to ask that

CORY
Got gas in your snowmobile

EXT WIND RIVER RESERVATION -- DAY

Cory drives a snowmobile over the frozen ground following
the tracks He is far from the cabin Far from anything The
mountains are so close you could almost reach out and touch
them To the left the prairie is broken with GAS DRILL AFTER
GAS DRILL all jutting eighty-feet into the air like giant
steel darts fired into the earth

Cory slows sees something he didn’t expect Stops the
snowmobile Looks down We do too

HUMAN FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW BAREFOOT FROZEN BLOOD STAINING
THE GROUND AROUND THEM

Cory steps off the snowmobile and places his hand against the
print -- knows instantly this person was not large

He checks his pistol and his rifle making sure both are
loaded removes the WHITE CAMO from his backpack Puts it on
Follows the tracks on foot

ANOTHER ANGLE --

From a distance he is invisible It is as though the snow
itself stood up and walked

WE WALK BEHIND HIM NOW

The mountains are a hundred yards from him Pine trees lord
over the snow The clouds cast a shadow that is visible just
fifty yards ahead

Cory studies the ground Takes two more steps then stops --

IN FRONT OF HIM IS A PERFECT IMPRINT OF THE GIRL As though
she laid down and made a bloody snow-angel

We see where she stood up and stumbled toward a small arroyo
just ahead

Cory slings the rifle over his shoulder slowly Silently
Pulls out his RUGER BLACKHAWK PISTOL

He hides the pistol under his coat and cocks the hammer --
no noise
Zi

He raises the pistol to eye level and moves forward Wherever
he looks -- the pistol points He crests the little arroyo
and stares down

At first he sees nothing Then -- A HAND REACHING FROM THE
SNOW

He looks around Nothing He looks at the ground No tracks
except those of the girl

He moves to the hand Gently brushes the snow away THE
RUNNING GIRL’S FACE STARES BACK Frozen in a constipated
moan Blood frozen to her face Blood mixed with the snow and
ice around her

Cory stares at her -- almost as frozen as she is

His breath leaves him -- but not from the sight of a dead
body He’s seen plenty in his day This is a body he knows

A snowflake falls Then another

Takes off his back pack pulls out a two-way radio Turns it
to channel 16 -- the emergency channel -- and speaks with a
hollow voice

CORY
I need emergency assistance
Repeat Emergency assistance
requested Come back

Static crackles then a voice filters through

DEPUTY (0S)
Fremont County Sheriffs office
What’s your emergency

CORY
I found a body on the Wind River
Indian Reservation west of Boulder
Flats I need Tribal Police to
respond to the following
location

We pull back and snow begins to fall We pull back farther
and Cory fades as the snow falls faster

A STRONG WIND pushes the snowflakes horizontal -- it is
snowing sideways

The storm breaks free from the mountains’ grasp with a
vengeful howl -- ready to punish this land and her people for
all the evil they’ve done
ZZ

EXT DAN CROWHEART’S CABIN -- DAY

Cory stands on the little porch with TRIBAL POLICE CHIEF BEN
SHOYO 50 kind round face and large heavy frame

They watch the storm throw snow at the earth like shrapnel

Barely visible to the left of the house are THREE TRIBAL
POLICE TRUCKS EMPTY FLAT-BED TRAILERS ATTACHED TO THE
BUMPERS AN AMBULANCE IS PARKED BESIDE THEM

Two snowmobiles sit in front of the house Ben lights a
smoke

CROWHEART
FBI’s taking a while eh

BEN
Roads bad out of Riverton I hate
to move her before they’ve had a
look but I’m not gonna try to pull
her out after dark We gotta get
this show on the road

Cory steps out into the snow Kicks at it with his boot

CORY
We’re losing the tracks

BEN
This ain’t letting up Not for a
while

CORY

Oughta let me follow ‘em while I
still can

BEN
Can’t have you out there without
the FBI’s okay Cory

Cory looks back to the men on the porch

CORY
You call her folks yet Ben

BEN
I want to get her to Lander first
It looks like Natalie but I don’t
want to call the wrong person Not
about this

Beat
Z5-

CORY
It’s Natalie

We look out from the porch and can barely make out -- A BLACK
SUV crawling through the snow on the main road

CORY (CONT’D)
There’s your Feds

INT BLACK SUV -- CONTINUOUS

FBI AGENT JANE BANNER 28 struggles to see through the snow
as her GPS directs her

GPS
In seventy-five feet turn right

JANE

GPS
Turn right Turn right

JANE
Where do you want me to turn

Dirty-blonde hair falls over a pretty face as she peers

closer to the windshield in an attempt to see where the hell
she’s supposed to go

EXT DAN CROWHEART’S CABIN -- PORCH -- DAY

Dan Ben and Cory look at the SUV -- barely visible through
the storm -- PULL TO A STOP on the highway

CROWHEART
What are these fools doing

CORY
Can’t see the road

Beat

BEN
We don’t have time for this

CORY
Ill go get ‘em

Cory walks to his snowmobile

INT JANE’S SUV -- CONT

She can barely make out the house a quarter-mile away and
the police vehicles -- white themselves -- are completely
invisible

Jane pulls a ROAD ATLAS out and studies it Looks back out
the window

Hears what sounds like the whine of a CHAIN SAW

Cory appears from the snow like a wraith pulls up beside
Janes window Knocks on it No idea a gun is now pointed at
him on the other side of the vehicle’s door

She cracks the window leery

CORY
You FBI

JANE
You Tribal Police

CORY
No But I’1l take you to them This
thing in four-wheel drive

JANE
Are you kidding

CORY
Alright follow me

Cory whips the snowmobile around spewing snow then drives
toward the house

GPS
In fifty feet --

Jane pounds the power button with her fist

JANE
Shut up

Jane puts the SUV in gear and follows The police vehicles
come into view as does Ben standing on the porch His
uniform is her first evidence this isn’t an ambush Cory has
already parked and is walking back to the protection of the
overhang

She slams the SUV in park and opens the vehicle door

EXT DAN CROWHEART’S CABIN -- CONT

She tosses a coat over a business suit as she stumbles toward
them in the shin-deep snow

JANE
I’m Jane Banner

BEN

JANE
Well Sorry to meet under these
circumstances (To Cory) You wanna

The men don’t move just exchange bewildered looks

Jane shivers hands jammed in her pockets A half-inch of
snow building on her shoulders and the top of her head

JANE (CONTD)
I don’t want to be rude but I’m
freezing my ass off here so

BEN
Yeah that’s gonna get a lot worse
if you go out there dressed like

JANE
I’m a big girl Thank you

Cory steps to her

CORY
Body’s a ten mile drive by

She looks away from his dark intense eyes Feels a little
silly as she shivers in place

JANE
I was in court in Riverton when I
got the call to come here This is
what I have --

BEN
You should have a winter-gear bag
in the back there --

JANE
This isn’t a government vehicle
it’s a rental I flew in from
Denver I’m just the closest agent
to the scene You don’t think I
can make it like this

She is already shivering to the point it’s affecting her
speech

CORY
Come inside We’ll get you fixed

up

He points toward the cabin Ben extends a hand to her as she
reaches the first step Crowheart has her elbow by the time

she’s on the porch It is clear none of these men think she

will live five minutes out here

She should be grateful She isn’t Pride makes her shake free
of the men cradling her like a wounded bird She walks into
the house

Ben looks at Cory shaking his head

BEN
See what they send us

INT CROWHEART’S CABIN -- BEDROOM -- A LITTLE LATER

The humiliation continues as ALICE CROWHEART 64 a hundred
pounds overweight and fierce eyes watches Jane pull a pair
of thermal underwear over her g-string

ALICE
Thermals can make underwear wedge
up your bottom but I guess yours
are already there

Jane’s smart enough to not respond
ALICE (CONTD)
Here these should fit You’re
skinny

JANE
Thanks

Alice hands her a pair of jeans They’re a little tight but
they’1l do She climbs into a pair of COVERALLS

Alice hands her a wool skull cap

ALICE
You got gloves

Beat

JANE
No

Alice shakes her head
ALICE
Goodness What were they thinking

sending you here

Aside from her cheeks virtually all of Jane is covered She
looks at herself in the mirror -- feels ridiculous

Alice looks too Covers her mouth with her hand Looks like
she may cry then turns back to the bed Starts folding the
rejects

JANE
Thank you

While looking down focused on her folding --
ALICE
You return them the minute you get
back They ain’t a gift

Alice turns and looks right at her

ALICE (CONT’D)
You hear me

JANE
Of course

Jane walks out to the living room -- all the men waiting for
her Notices Casey
Zd-e

JANE (CONTD)
Okay I’m Bundled Let’s go

Casey grabs his coat pulls it on
CROWHEART
Youre gonna stay with me young

buck

Casey looks up at his father Cory kneels down Looks into
his eyes as his hand gently cups the back of Casey’s neck

CORY
A couple more hours son I’m
sorry

CASEY

A couple This is our day

CORY
I promise

Casey seems to tighten and deflate at the same time as his
father rises and walks to the door

Ben looks outside

BEN
It ain’t letting up

Cory looks then turns back to Jane

CORY
It’s ten below outside You leave
that pride on the porch and hug me
like your prom date understood

Jane is so offended she almost falls backwards

JANE
I’m the highest ranking law
enforcement officer for three
hundred miles in any direction
Don’t ever tell me what to do
again

Steps closer to her

CORY
I don’t want to insult you just
making sure there’s only one girl
froze to death out there today

She turns from him and walks out into the storm
EXT SAGEBRUSH PRAIRIE -- DAY

Jane sits behind Cory on the snowmobile They race through
the white at 60 miles-per-hour

Jane presses her face into the back of this stranger -- her
hands tucked under his ass -- as she experiences cold ina
Manner unexplainable to those who haven’t endured it

Up ahead we see FOUR POLICE SNOWMOBILES and FOUR OFFICERS
huddling around a MOBILE PROPANE HEATER TWO EMT’S huddle
beside the body

Cory and Ben park Walk toward them Cory doesn’t wait for
Jane to start asking questions

CORY
I picked up her tracks about 300
meters to the south

Jane nods as she struggles to shake off the bone-breaking
cold

They walk past the officers to NATALIE HANSON’S BODY and an
EMT holding a HEAT GUN -- basically a very powerful hair
dryer -- that he waves along Natalie’s body where it meets
the ice that holds her

Jane kneels next to her

JANE
(Calls back to Ben)Got a positive
ID

BEN

Not positive no
Cory and three of the officers say in unison

EVERYONE
It’s Natalie Hanson

BEN
Haven’t found any identification
no one from the family has
identified the body but

JANE
Well call that positive for now
She live close

BEN
Fort Wakashie North a ways
JANE
What’s ‘a ways’

BEN
Thirty minute drive

JANE
Okay she didn’t run from home

Jane studies the gash Touches the body

JANE (CONTD)
She’s frozen solid

She looks back at Ben

JANE (CONTD)
No one reported her missing Her

parents
BEN
No
She takes that in
JANE

Makes the parents rather suspect

No one likes the sound of that but they all hold their
tongues

Jane notices dried blood that has soaked and frozen to the
crotch of her sweatpants Notices her bare feet

JANE (CONTD)
(Softly) Who did this to you
honey

As out of place as Jane is in the wild and this may very
well be her first murder scene -- she ignores the cold and
focuses Patient Observant She looks up at Ben

JANE (CONTD)
How experienced is your medical
examiner

The irony of this girl asking who’s experienced

BEN
He stays busy
JANE
Order a rape kit When he’s done
with his prelim I want her sent to
Cheyenne Make sure her belongings
go with her I need them tested
I’m listing this as a homicide

One of the officers can’t help but mumble --

OFFICER
Gee you think

Jane stands looks over the land -- covered in a foot
fresh powder With more falling

JANE
We’re not going to find the attack
site if it’s out in the open Not
till spring anyway

She turns to Cory

JANE (CONTD)
How well do you know this land

CORY
Like it’s my job Which it is

JANE
Anywhere she could have been
running from Anything close

CORY
Nearest homes are seven or eight
miles southeast

BEN
Sam Littlefeather’s house is out
there

CORY
Yep

BEN

Those boys are worth looking into

JANE
I’m no survivalist but that’s too
far to run in the snow -- she’s

dressed no better than I was and I
almost froze to death in your front
yard

of

Sl
SZ

CORY
You’re not from here

JANE
There’s no structures closer

CORY
Drill rigs maybe five miles from
here There’s trailers for the
workers But they shut it down in
the winter

JANE
So why would a teenage girl be out
here

BEN

Kids come out here on snowmobiles
Have a big party out here in the
snow

JANE
Not barefoot they don’t (To Cory)
What do you think

CORY
Only thing I can tell you about is
the tracks

JANE

That’s the only thing we’ve got

Cory looks at her for a moment walks a few feet begins
kicking snow -- making a little clearing

He kneels into the snow and very delicately begins using his
hands then leans over and blows the snow away

CORY
Look here

She leans over him NATALIE’S FOOT PRINT AND FROZEN BLOOD
NOW MIXED WITH SNOW is visible

CORY (CONT’D)
See how the toes twist out And the
front of the track is deeper than
the back -- almost no imprint of
the heel

JANE
Yeah
CORY
She was running

He stands Points to Natalie’s body thirty yards away

CORY (CONT’D)
She ran until she dropped There’s
a spot over here where she fell

Cory walks to the bloody snow angel

CORY (CONTD)

A pool of blood where her face hit
Gets down to twenty below out here
at night You breathe that cold air
deep in your lungs -- like when
youre running it’1ll freeze em
Lungs fill up with blood you start
coughing it up

He points to the impression of her face and the pool of
blood

CORY (CONT’D)
Wherever she came from she ran all
the way here Her lungs burst and
she curled up under that tree She
didn’t freeze to death She
drowned

Beat

JANE
How far could someone run barefoot
out here

He looks out over the mountains

CORY

I seen tourists freeze to death in
these mountains when it was barely
40 degrees I seen a fur trader
caught in his own trap drag
himself six miles to a forest
service cabin and radio for help
In the dead of winter There
ain’t no gauge for the will to
live Some have it Plenty don’t

I knew this girl She was a
fighter However far we think she
ran my guess is she ran farther

Cory looks east

S55

CORY (CONTD)
I got to get back to my son I
promised him a few hours

JANE
Would you be willing to help me I
mean I can’t Hell I couldn’t

find the way back to my car I
don’t know how to investigate this
without (She turns to Ben) Can I
borrow him for a few days

BEN
He don’t work for me (To Cory) You
got a lion to kill don’t forget

CORY
There’s three of ‘em And I didn’t

JANE
- What do you do for the Forest
Service
CORY

I’m a hunter

JANE
- A lion hunter

CORY
I hunt predators

She looks back at the police officers trying to free
Natalie’s corpse from a frozen land intent on keeping her

JANE
Good Come hunt one for me

WE PUSH IN CLOSER

Past the officers Past the heat gun We rest on her face --
watching as she slowly thaws Watching the ice that sealed
her eyes begin to melt and run down her cheeks like tears

Cory looks at her Says very softly --

CORY
Okay

INT JANE’S SUV -- NIGHT

SNOW pounds the windshield as the wipers work frantically to
remove it Snow swarms in the headlights like locust

Jane leans forward chin almost resting on the steering
wheel straining to see the road

GPS
In half a mile turn left on East
Main Street

The GPS may be right but there is no way to know -- Jane
can’t see ten feet in front of her

She slows down even more -- barely going 30 Turns on her
hazards

GPS (CONT’D)
In three hundred feet turn left on
East Main Street

She slows a little more but still sees nothing -- no road
Nothing

GPS (CONTD)
Turn left Turn left

She looks to the left then back to her right --
A TRUCK HORN BLARES

She slams on her brakes and begins sliding as a SEMI whips
by mere feet from her bumper

She slides to a stop in the middle of the intersection now
facing the direction of the Semi

She struggles to slow her beating heart as she watches the
brake lights of the truck that almost killed her

The TRUCK DRIVER gets out runs back to her She rolls her
window down

JANE
I’m sorry I can’t see anything

TRUCK DRIVER
IF YOU DON’T KNOW HOW TO DRIVE IN
THIS YOU SHOULDN’T BE ON THE ROAD

JANE
Who the hell knows how to drive in
this
TRUCK DRIVER
Pull up behind me and follow me
close Don’t slam your brakes Stay

in second gear -- and you pull your
ass into the first motel we come
to

JANE

That’s where I’m headed anyway

TRUCK DRIVER
Well I guess it’s your goddam lucky
day

He turns and runs through the storm back to his truck She
rolls up her window

JANE
(To no one) I’m really sorry we
never had blizzards in FUCKING
FLORIDA I’d like to see one of
you bastards in a hurricane

He begins slowly moving forward Mad as she is -- she obeys
and pulls up right behind him

EXT SILVER SPUR LODGE -- LANDER WYOMING -- NIGHT
The parking lot is completely empty and covered with snow

The truck driver points out his window at the motel -- wildly
gesturing for her to go there

Jane turns into the lot slamming the curb and spinning her
wheels in a furious attempt to reach the safety of the
covered entrance

She parks Draws in a deep breath opens the door and steps
into the fury of the storm

INT SILVER SPUR LODGE -- LANDER WYOMING -- NIGHT

leather couches and watercolors of mountains cowboys and

INT CORY LAMBERT’S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Cory sits at his dining room table A CENTERFIRE CARTRIDGE
RELOADER in front of him Beside him is a MARLIN GUIDE GUN --
a stainless steel lever-action rifle chambered in 45-70 It
is a rifle for stopping bears When they are running right at
you

On a small scale he weighs bullets choosing only those that
weigh exactly 540 grains He seats a rifle casing in the
reloader places a bullet in the machine’s teeth pulls a
lever

When he returns the lever upright he has a fully formed
bullet almost four inches long

CORY
She died from the cold

CASEY

Cory pushes back from the table Sets the rifle on the table
Pulls his son onto his lap

CASEY

CASEY
It’s a grizzly isn’t it

CORY
I don’t know what it is yet But

You wanna go back to bed

CASEY
No Can I sleep with you tonight

CORY

Casey nods as if that wasn’t an answer he had considered

CORY (CONT’D)
You wanna curl up on the sofa and
I’1l take you back with me when I’m
done

Okay

Casey slips off his dad’s lap crawls on the couch and
disappears under a blanket

Cory returns to his reloader and the chore of fashioning
death half an ounce at a time

EXT CORY LAMBERT’S HOUSE -- DAWN

We watch from across the road as Cory walks toward the barn
Casey running behind Sunlight bounces off the snow The
storm has passed Blue skies above

We watch them disappear into the barn Watch the horses press

against the gate unable to go another minute without their
breakfast

Casey opens the door Steps out

CORY
Good luck on that test

CASEY

Casey closes the door before Cory gets to say it back Casey
runs toward the school through a foot of snow

Cory watches the boy until he steps through the doors and
they close behind him Puts the truck in gear Cory’s face
hardens -- he is a hunter again

INT FREMONT COUNTY CORONER’S OFFICE -- NIGHT

Jane walks down a dim grey hallway Ben leans against the
wall sipping coffee

BEN
I see you found town okay
JANE
Barely Did the family identify
her
BEN
Yeah
JANE

They give you a reason for not
reporting her missing

BEN
Got a boyfriend she stayed with
some Didn’t think anything of it
She was eighteen Free to do
what she wanted

JANE
Gonna need to talk to the
boyfriend

BEN
We’ll get to that

Ben begins to push the exam room door open then stops

BEN (CONT’D)
You ever done this before

JANE
Observed an autopsy Come on No
- Is it that obvious

BEN
Anyone who tells you they get
easier is a goddam liar Let’s get
it over with

They push through the doors

INT EXAM ROOM -- CORONERS OFFICE -- CONT

On a steel table is Natalie Naked Chest sawed open like a
gutted deer Jane pretends like it doesn’t weaken her knees
Ben walks toward the body no attempt to hide his unease
toward this awful part of his job

A man dressed in scrubs runs a centrifuge along a far wall

BEN
Randy you’re on a clock I’ve got
about five minutes of this in me
so let’s go

DR RANDY WHITEHURST turns and walks to the body

DR WHITEHURST
I’ll be quick (Nods to Jane) Good
morning Randy Whitehurst I’m the
medical examiner

Jane wants to look anywhere but the body or the man that cut
her in half

JANE
Uh huh I’m Agent Banner

BEN
FBI --

JANE
Thank you yes I’m FBI

He studies her

DR WHITEHURST
This your first autopsy

How the fuck does everyone know that

DR WHITEHURST (CONT’D)
Hey gotta have a first

JANE
Yes it’s my first on an
investigation but I am trained
for this so everyone just Can
we get to it please

DR WHITEHURST
Yes ma’am As you see here she
suffered a deep laceration along
her brow line

He points at each act of violence Waits for nods from both
Jane and Ben before moving on

DR WHITEHURST (CONT’D)
Two separated ribs Frost bite in
both feet up through her ankles
frost bite on her nose and her left
hand -- the frost bite on her feet
is stage four you can tell by the
blueing here you see that

JANE
Yes

DR WHITEHURST
Vaginal wall is torn The damage on
multiple sides of the wall at
different depths indicates
penetration by different
individuals and the bite marks
along her neck and on the left
nipple have distinct measurements --

JANE
So there were two assailants

DR WHITEHURST
At least I swabbed her and sent
the samples by courier to Cheyenne
(MORE )
DR WHITEHURST (CONTD)
We should have DNA results in a
week or so but I will state in my
report sexual assault by multiple
offenders

Jane has found herself next to Natalie’s head can’t help but
gently stroke her hair as though reminding herself this
carcass had a soul

DR WHITEHURST (CONT’D)
Don’t touch her -- I haven’t combed
her hair for forensics yet

JANE
Sorry

BEN
What are you listing as the cause
of death

DR WHITEHURST
You’re not going to like it -- she
died from a pulmonary hemorrhage
When sub-zero air is drawn into
lungs it can cause the alveoli --
the tiny sacs in the lungs -- to
burst Fluid builds in the lungs
and if the air is cold enough
liquid in the lungs will
crystallize Ultimately the victim
either freezes from the inside out
or they drown in their own blood
That’s the cause of death in
this instance

Jane thinks Cory was right Then she realizes --

JANE
You’re not listing this as a
homicide

DR WHITEHURST
Can’t

JANE
But You have to factor in the
circumstances She was raped
Repeatedly Beaten And then --

DR WHITEHURST
Look circumstances is your field
not mine Let me show you come
here --
JANE
I don’t need it explained -- I need
to find whoever chased her to death
in this frozen hell and put them in
prison and not calling this a

She walks a lap around the room calming herself comes back
to where she started

JANE (CONTD)
Sorry

DR WHITEHURST
This is very prosecutable as a
murder -- clearly she wouldn’t have
been running through the snow if
she hadn’t been attacked but I
can’t list the cause of death as a
homicide

JANE
The only way I can get an FBI team
to the reservation is if it’s
listed as a homicide I’m not here
to solve this I’m here to obtain a
cause of death and have someone
sent here who can --

DR WHITEHURST
Look present the rape present the
assault and I’m sure --

JANE
Those aren’t federal crimes Those
crimes fall to the Bureau of Indian
Affairs and Sorry

DR WHITEHURST
You keep saying sorry but you keep
doing it

She looks at Ben eyes begging for an alternative

BEN
Hey I’m used to no help

JANE
You have six officers on your
entire force -- to cover an area

the size of Rhode Island No
offense but this will have to curl
up in your lap for you to solve it

He does take offense but also knows it’s true
4d

DR WHITEHURST
We all know it’s a murder Have a
US Attorney sign off on it I’m
happy to corroborate that I just
can’t put it on the death
certificate

She walks off shaking her head

JANE
Okay Thank you

She pushes through the double doors to the hall Ben walks
out after her She leans against the wall looking at the
ceiling

BEN
I appreciate your passion Not the
usual response from Feds But
Randy’s on our side --

She turns to him fierce

JANE
As soon as my supervisor sees this
he’s going to want me back in
Denver Not that I’m much help but
- I’m all you’re going to get We
have no time What’s that

INT HANSON HOME -- FORT WASHAKIE WYOMING -- DAY

We are inside a house that screams poverty Furniture is old
and broken to the point of barely being functional Faux-wood
siding of the manufactured home is fraying at the edges
Still extreme care has been given to make it into a home
Photos of Natalie and a handsome TEENAGE BOY are pasted on
every wall

We hear Ben’s voice as we look over the home

BEN (0S
So you never met him

MAN (058
No

BEN (0S

And she never talked about him

MAN (0S
Not to me

The man’s voice is soft deep almost soothing As we push in
on a photo of Natalie and the handsome young man who is
clearly her brother we hear --

JANE (0S)
Why would you let her stay with a
man you’ve never met A man whose
name you don’t even know I look
around see all these photos --

MARTIN (0S)
She was an adult

JANE
Barely
We see the man now -- Natalie’s father MARTIN HANSON 40s
every bit of 6’2” Long black hair pulled in a braided pony
tail Dark heavy face But those eyes -- a hawk’s eyes A

warrior’s eyes Which are burning into Jane He looks at Ben

MAN
Wyuksa psi wasichu

JANE
What does that mean

BEN
- It’s not good

She looks at the big man apologizing without backing down
JANE
I don’t mean to offend you I’m
trying to understand the dynamic
Mr Hanson I’m trying to help

MARTIN
Why is it whenever you people try
to help it starts with insults

He steps toward her furious eyes and all She resists the
temptation to draw her weapon

MARTIN (CONTD)
I don’t know why she wouldn’t tell

me But she was eighteen I chose
to trust her I chose wrong

He looks her over
JANE
How about your wife did your

daughter talk to her

MARTIN
Do you talk to your mother

Beat

JANE
It’s Annie Is she here

MARTIN
She’s in the bedroom

JANE
Id like to speak to her

His hawk eyes narrow He says almost like a dare --

MARTIN
Be my guest

JANE
Thank you (Points down the hall)
Bedroom this way

BEN
Jane

Ben shakes his head ‘no’

JANE
(To Martin) You don’t mind
Dl

MARTIN
Hey you don’t need my permission
You’re an adult Barely

Point made She walks down the hall Comes to a closed door
Knocks softly No answer She opens the door and sees --

ANNIE HANSON is 50 heavy and COVERED IN BLOOD She sits on
the edge of her bed sobbing mumbling and rocking back and
forth gripping a KITCHEN KNIFE Cuts run up and down her
arms She never notices the open door Jane doesn’t give her
a chance to -- she closes the door quickly

Jane stands a moment in the hall -- she is in no way prepared
to navigate this world and she knows it She dreads walking
to the living room and facing Martin but does it anyway

When she reaches the living room Martin stares hell at her
She has it coming

JANE
I’m sorry

There is a knock at the door Martin opens it It’s Cory

The two men stare at each other Don’t speak Martin’s lips
tighten Cory gives him a sad smile Martin’s tight lips
begin to quiver

Cory steps back onto the porch Martin follows him Cory
kicks the door and we glimpse Martin fold into Cory’s arms as
it closes shutting us out

Through the door we hear the man heaving enormous sobs that
seem to shake the house’s flimsy foundation

Ben and Jane stand perfectly still listening to pain echo
against the door like a storm

EXT HANSON HOME -- WIND RIVER WYOMING -- LATER

Cory and Martin sit on the porch looking out over the snow-
covered sagebrush

CORY
Id like to tell you it gets
easier but it doesn’t If there’s
a comfort -- you get used to the
pain if you let yourself I went
to a grief seminar in Casper Don’t
know why just It hurt so much
I was searching for anything that
could make it go away

(MORE)
DZ

CORY (CONTD)
That’s what I wanted this seminar
to do -- make it go away The
instructor come up to me after the
seminar was over sat beside me and
said “I got good news and bad
news Bad news is you’1l never be
the same You’1ll never be whole
Ever What was taken from you can’t
be replaced You’re daughter’s
gone Now the good news -- as
soon as you accept that as soon as
you let yourself suffer allow
yourself to grieve You’ll be
able to visit her in your mind and
remember all the joy she gave you
All the love she knew Right now
you don’t even have that do you”

Martin finds himself shaking his head ‘no’ even though the
question wasn’t directed at him

CORY (CONTD)
He said “that’s what not accepting
this will rob from you”

Cory looks at Martin

CORY (CONT’D)
If you shy from the pain of it
then you rob yourself of every
memory of her my friend Every
one From her first step to her
last smile You’1ll kill ‘em all

Cory puts his hand on Martin’s neck guides his eyes up to
him

CORY (CONTD)
Take the pain Take the pain
Martin It’s the only way to keep
her with you

Martin drops his head into his lap Cory resists the
temptation to do the same

The big man stands up pulls a cigarette from his pocket
lights it Walks out into the snow

MARTIN
I’m tired Cory I’m just so tired
of fighting this life
DS

CORY
What you do now you do for your
son

MARTIN

Drugs is his family now He’s
gone too Lives just down the damn
road but He’s gone

Martin takes a long drag

MARTIN (CONTD)
I expect they’1l find he’s involved
in this somehow

Beat

CORY
He stays with the Littlefeather
boys doesn’t he

MARTIN
Yep You’re driving this Fed
around so she don’t get lost that
it

CORY
That’s what they asked me to do
but that’s not what I’m doing

MARTIN
What are you doing

Martin looks back at Cory
CORY
I’m a hunter What do you think I’m

doing

Martin walks toward the porch bores his hawk eyes into his
old friend

MARTIN
If you find who did this (His
eyes burn into Cory) No matter who
it is You understand me

He does

CORY
Right where they stand

Martin nods Flicks his cigarette into the snow
D4

MARTIN

Then get off my porch and go do it

Cory stands and follows Martin as he heads back into his
crumbling house
INT CORY’S PICK UP -- DAY
Cory follows Jane’s SUV who follows Ben’s squad car They
move down an empty highway As they drive Cory looks over
sees two coyotes trotting through the snow to his left

Notices a flock of sheep on the horizon

The sheep form their silly circle as the coyotes move closer
at a dead run

Cory doesn’t slow down and doesn’t look back He’s not
hunting coyotes Not today

EXT SAM LITTLEFEATHER’S HOUSE -- DAY

The house is the very essence of dilapidation An old
burgundy MINIVAN that can’t possibly run sits beside a
lowered TOYOTA TERCEL in the driveway

HIP-HOP pulses the windows of the flimsy house

Cory Jane and Ben pull off the road Get out Cory looks

down -- sees snow-filled SNOWMOBILE TRACKS beside the
highway They disappear abruptly -- as though they levitated
Or were loaded onto a trailer

Cory begins walking through the snow to the back of the house
as Jane and Ben head to the front door

Ben draws his pistol

BEN
Natalie’s brother lives here with
Sam and Bart Littlefeather anda
real piece of work named Frank

Walker Hanson’s kid is bad -- but
the others are stone evil Watch
yourself

JANE

Should we maybe wait for some back-
up
DD

BEN
This ain’t the land of back-up
Jane This is the land of you’re on
your own

Jane shakes her head and nods at the same time Draws her
pistol

Ben pounds on the door They wait for an answer

EXT LITTLEFEATHER HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- CONT
CORY WALKS THROUGH THE SNOW He stares at the ground looking
for anything that tells a story Notices SNOWMOBILE TRACKS
almost completely filled in with fresh snow that run west
into the mountains disappearing into the black timber
He stares at the tracks Mumbles to himself

CORY

Who goes into the mountains just
before a storm

EXT SAM LITTLEFIELD’S HOUSE -- CONT

Jane and Ben still stand outside the door Ben knocks again
hard enough to knock the flimsy door through the frame

The music shuts off Feet move toward the door It opens

SAM LITTLEFEATHER is 20 tall and rail thin His shaved head
is covered in a RAIDER’S SKULL CAP His wild eyes fueled by
three day’s worth of meth

He nods and bounces in place

SAM
Yeah

BEN
Looking for Chip Hanson He around

Sam shakes his head for an eternity

SAM
Not here brah

JANE
Who are you

SAM
Who the fuck are you
JANE
I’m the FBI dickhead You Sam

He stares at her a moment

SAM
No
BEN
Are you high right now Sam -- how

many times have I arrested you
He stares his tweaked eyes at Ben A flicker of recognition

SAM
Chief wazzup Brah

BEN
Your brother here

SAM
He’s in prison Where you put him

BEN
No parole Look at that the
justice system at work

Sam’s wild eyes bore into Ben

SAM
Reminds me I’m supposed to give
you this from my PO Hold on
got it in here somewhere yeah here

it is --

He fishes a small canister of pepper spray from his coat
pocket and empties it into their faces

Ben and Jane fall back coughing and rubbing furiously at

their eyes The door closes Frantic footsteps and yelling
come from the house as Ben and Jane stumble into the snow
gasping for breath

EXT LITTLEFEATHER HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- CONT

Cory hears the shouting and coughing Ben yells a warning to
him then -- FOOTSTEPS moving through the house toward the
back door Cory runs toward it picking up a SNOW SHOVEL on
the way

He brings the shovel up plants his foot and swings like
hell as the back door opens -- a FAT TEENAGER DRESSED LIKE A
GANGSTER runs right into the meat of the shovel
He is blown back into the door frame and into CHIP HANSON
21 the boy from the photos on Martin Hanson’s wall Chip
falls over the fat one landing hard in the snow FACE FIRST
He rolls over and sees

FROM CHIP’S POV --

We are looking up at Cory -- AND HIS BOOT -- coming toward
us Fast Blocking the sun like an eclipse Slamming us back
into the snow

EXT LITTLEFEATHER HOUSE -- FRONT DOOR -- CONT

Jane forces herself to stand snot and tears running freely
down her face Ben is struggling to stand fighting the

liquid cayenne pepper wreaking havoc on his senses

He stumbles to the ground vomiting and cursing
simultaneously

Jane sneezes and spits mucus as she raises her pistol eye-
level and enters the house

INT LITTLEFEATHER HOUSE -- CONT

It is dark No electricity A small fire burns in an oil drum
in the living room -- smoke escaping through a hole in the
roof

WE RUN BEHIND HER LOOKING OVER HER SHOULDER

She stumbles sneezes and trips over the ocean of trash on
the floor Notices the open back door and Cory standing over
the two teens sprawled in the snow

She motions for him to stay there and moves deeper into the
house

She hears the sounds of shells being fed into a shotgun
hears a round pumped into the chamber

She stumbles through the ankle-high trash and falls against
the wall announcing her presence She strains to see through
her tears

A BLACK BLUR MOVES INTO THE HALLWAY

She fires round after round in its direction The muzzle
flash of her pistol blinds us -- the echo of the rounds beat

into our skull

RINGING IS ALL WE CAN HEAR
DS

She stumbles further down the hall Sees Sam crumpled on the
floor -- a shotgun beside him

A bullet has pierced his cheek another his neck Goose down
protrudes from holes in his coat Blood pumps from his neck
to the rhythm of his dying heart

He looks up at her -- face filled with surprise and hate He
tries to say something but no sound comes

THE RINGING FADES REPLACED WITH JANE’S LABORED BREATHING
She leans against the wall Hears Ben kicking through the
trash behind her She looks back down -- Sam is trying to
grab the shotgun -- piece of shit to the very last

She reaches down grabs the shotgun Steps away still
pointing her pistol at him

BEN
The other two’s outside with Cory
Let’s go

JANE
He’s alive Ben We need to call
EMS

BEN

EMS is an hour away Leave him

JANE
He’s not dead Ben

Ben walks up to Sam looks down Sam’s wild wired eyes stare
back He gulps for air once twice There is no third
time

BEN
Like I said Let’s go

They walk out of frame leaving us with Sam’s lifeless body
on the floor -- beer cans fast food containers and filthy
clothes scattered around him

EXT LITTLEFEATHER HOUSE -- BACKYARD -- CONT

When Jane and Ben step out they see two young men hog-tied
with bailing wire face down in the snow

Cory leans against a small tool shed holding his revolver

CORY
Skinny one’s Natalie’s brother
JANE
Who’s the other one

BEN
That’s Frank Walker (To Frank)
Won’t your daddy be proud

FRANK
My dad’s in prison asshole

BEN
I know I put him there Prison’1l
be good for you Frank Get you on
your dad’s exercise plan -- lifting
weights and selling hand jobs for
cigarettes Slim you right up
You’11 come out of there looking
like Johnny Depp I bet

JANE
Tell me what happened to your
sister Chip

CHIP
What What happened to her

BEN
Don’t play dumb

CHIP
About what What happened to her

Jane and Ben look at him Is he a criminal and a drug addict
Yes Is he a liar Sure Is he lying now -- not a chance

CHIP (CONTD)
What did those crackers do

No one speaks

BEN
What crackers Was she seeing a
white man Do you know him -- do

you know who he is

JANE
Do you know his name Chip

Beat

CHIP
You said was Why did you say
was (Chip looks up at Cory) What
happened Why did she say was
(MORE )
oU

CHIP (CONTD)
She just said was -- why did she
say was

Cory stands up walks over to him Kneels close Speaks
softly as he points toward the mountains

CORY
Because I found her raped and
killed right over there son
That’s why

Beat

CHIP
- WHAAATTTT

From across the frozen plains we look at Sam Littlefeather’s
house -- smoke rising through a hole in the roof Chip’s
screams carrying across the white desert -- or perhaps it’s
the wind howling

In this place they sound the same

EXT LITTLEFEATHER HOUSE -- LATER

Again -- an ambulance and police vehicles Officers mill
about out front Chip and Frank sit cuffed in the back of
separate cars

Cory is unloading his snowmobile off the trailer Jane is
pulling on coveralls emblazoned with the BIA POLICE SEAL

She walks up to Cory who straps a gun case into a rifle rack
on the front of his snowmobile Straps a HEAVY DUFFEL BAG AND
SNOWSHOES to the back

JANE
You go I’m going to get Chip to
Lander See if he’ll give me a name
for this boyfriend He’s who we
need to find

CORY
This is how we find him

JANE
No We go to where he works or
where he lives (Pointing to the
mountains) not out there

CORY
Okay where’s he live Where’s he
work What’s his name

(MORE)
ol

CORY (CONTD)
You think that piece of shit’s
gonna tell you You keep looking
for clues and missing all the
signs You see that

He points out over the snow

JANE
I don’t -- no I don’t see
anything

He shakes his head as he pulls a pair of binoculars from the
duffel

CORY
Look there

She takes the binoculars Looks through them

JANE
Where

He stands behind her wraps his arm around her and points
out over the snow

CORY
You see my arm through the binocs

JANE
That’s all I can see

CORY
When I move my hand look where it
was You see the tracks a sled
track filled with snow Look
for the shadow in it

JANE
I think so
CORY
Now look straight out -- at the

base of the mountains you’1ll see
it easy there

In the distance the slight indentation stands out The
tracks run straight from the house up into the pine trees
that cover the mountain

JANE
Yes I see it

She looks up at him
oZ

CORY
Natalie died over there -- seven
miles(He points north) Those
tracks lead to the mountain from
here -- that’s five miles

He points south to tall drill rigs jutting up from the
ground

CORY (CONTD)

There’s West-Central’s nearest
rigs Six miles Someone unloaded
sleds right here and drove way the
hell out there but there’s no
tracks coming back -- why is that
(Cory points at the house) Do those
assholes look like they’re up for a
trek ten miles into the snow In
what -- that minivan The answers
are out there

It’s hard to say whether she doesn’t buy what he’s saying or
just dreads going into the mountains She comes clean

JANE
Look I’ve never done this
before okay

He nods Appreciates the honesty

CORY
It’s all I’ve ever done

JANE
(Reluctantly) Okay Let’s go

Cory gets on fires it up Pulls a TWO-WAY RADIO from his
coveralls clips it to the front Jane climbs on and Cory
pulls around to the back of the house

TWO OFFICERS are lining the house with police tape Ben steps
from the house

CORY
What channel you running

BEN
Eleven

Cory tunes his radio to eleven
OS

BEN (CONTD)
I want to see you back here by

nightfall -- gives you three hours
at best

CORY
Ill radio if we come across
anything

He guns his sled and they shoot off over the snow

EXT WYOMING PLAINS -- LATER

WE ARE FLYING OVER THE SNOW -- ALARMINGLY FAST Again Jane
finds herself pasted to Cory’s back -- hiding from the snow
that pelts every exposed part of her

The forest looms over us We are climbing now Trees begin
whipping past us Cory doesn’t slow down

We are moving almost vertically up the mountain -- the engine
whines angrily as the snowmobile lurches uphill digging down
into the snow then firing out of it like a rocket

They reach a bench -- a level area that cuts into the
mountain

Cory stops Cuts the engine it is instantly silent

Jane dares to look up and is shocked to find the valley floor
a thousand feet below them

Cory steps off -- pulling the stainless steel rifle from its
case and levering a round into the chamber

He speaks softly aware they are both hunter and hunted out
here

CORY
The tracks move south from here

JANE
(Whispering) What are we doing

CORY
Gonna go it on foot for a bit

Not what she wanted to hear

Cory pulls the snowshoes free tosses a pair to her

CORY (CONT’D)
Step into ‘em then ratchet the
strap down till they’re good and
tight

She does His are already on by the time she’s strapped one
foot in She steps into the other

JANE
Now what

CORY
Follow me

They walk through the soft deep snow of the mountains

The snowmobile tracks cut west away from the valley into
even deeper timber They follow

Jane pants heavily -- she is in snow to her waist It is
grueling work to take even one step though you wouldn’t know
it from watching Cory who is pulling away from her

She labors forward looks up at a clump of Aspens and Pines
Looks back down unable to see her feet through the snow

When she looks up again the clump of trees silently comes to
life the trunks melting into one giant mass that is walking
toward the clearing

She freezes

IT IS A BULL MOOSE stepping through the snow making no
sound It stands almost eight feet tall and it is looking
right at her

She feels Cory step quietly beside her

JANE
(Whispers) What the fuck is that

CORY
(Quiet) Moose stay still He don’t
want any more trouble than you do

JANE
I don’t want ANY

CORY
Then you two have something in
common
oD

The enormous creature moves across the ‘road’ and the barely
visible tracks they follow It is twenty feet from them and
still makes no sound

It slinks into the trees across the road and is enveloped by
the forest -- disappearing as quickly as it appeared

Janes tries to gasp in a silent breath of much needed air
Cory can’t help but smile

JANE
Yeah yeah Come to Florida
sport We have alligators on our
golf courses

CORY
No thank you I’1l stick to the
world I know

Cory starts moving off Jane gathers her strength and
follows

CROWS can be heard cawing The trail opens to a clearing the
snow here is so deep there is no evidence of any tracks

But at the far end of the clearing A DOZEN CROWS gather
around a DEAD SOMETHING

Cory moves toward it trudging through the snow The crows
scream their frustration at having their dinner interrupted
As Cory and Jane get closer they relent and fly to nearby
branches

They stare at the dead animal -- flesh the color of a peeled
apple They are almost upon it before they realize it is a
man

JANE
Oh my God

Cory steps closer Looks at the body which is stripped
naked The crows have been busy as have the other animals
of the forest though his face has been mostly spared

He is young and white

JANE (CONTD)
Do you know him

CORY
No Bet I know who he is though

Cory nods Looks around No snowmobile tracks anywhere He
moves into the forest
bo

JANE
What are you doing

CORY
Stay here

Cory pushes into the timber Looks at the ground where snow
is unable to cover as quickly

He scans the harder snow Spots Something Moves to it
ANGLE ON

A SNOWMOBILE TRACK -- clear enough to see the tread pattern
Cory’s face registers surprise He follows the track a bit
The thicker timber opens up to another clearing and the track
disappears

He looks up at the sky -- the sun is fading Looks back at
Jane -- no chance she is up for or capable of continuing this
into the night He turns back

Jane looks relieved when he reappears from the forest

JANE
See anything

CORY
The tracks don’t lead from the
house They lead to it Someone
stripped this boy left him here
and drove down to Littlefeather’s
house loaded their sleds on a
trailer and headed down the
highway

Jane has no idea how Cory has put this together but
recognizes the truth of it She looks down Ashamed Has to
laugh

JANE
Are there tracks we can follow

CORY
For a bit They went high where the
snow’s deeper Where the tracks
would get covered

She looks at him

JANE
I need to get a team up here that
has experience with this area With
crimes like these This was
CORY
This was well thought out

She looks over at the man half-eaten and frozen in the snow

CUT TO

EXT LITTLEFEATHER HOUSE -- NIGHT

The number of police vehicles has grown FREMONT COUNTY
SHERIFF’S VEHICLES CAN BE SEEN NUMEROUS SNOWMOBILES LINED
UP PREPARING TO HEAD OUT

Cory speaks with Ben

CORY
We went on foot the last half mile
but we blazed a decent trail
through the snow I’1l run them
back up there if you need

BEN
I’ll talk to the sheriff he may
want you to

Jane walks up to them

BEN (CONTD)
The security team at West-Central’s
rig site has cameras around their
perimeter I’m gonna head over in
the morning maybe we’ll get lucky
and they caught something on film

JANE
Okay The two we have in custody
say anything

BEN
These aren’t the talking kind
Jane These kids -- they expect to

go to prison It’s a rite of
passage Hell I think they look
forward to it Three hots a cot
and free cable Beats being here
doing nuthing the way they see it

JANE
Let’s run their DNA against the
semen see what that tells us

Cory looks over at the police car where Chip still sits
0d

CORY
Can I talk to him

JANE
Cory anything they might tell you
would be inadmissable in court and
anything you told us would render
everything that resulted
inadmissable as well

CORY
What if I talked to him and didn’t
tell you what he said I just knew
it

Janes cell phone rings Answers

JANE
Agent Banner Yes sir yes we did

Jane steps away Cory looks at Ben

CORY
I’ve known him since he was three

Ben can’t say yes Doesn’t want to say no

BEN
I gotta canvas the house The back
doors are only locked from the
inside

Ben walks off Cory looks at the squad car Goes to it

INT BEN’S POLICE VEHICLE -- NIGHT

Chip sits shivering Looks exhausted Coming down maybe
Maybe just tired from crying Cory opens the door sits
beside him -- leaves one foot outside so he doesn’t lock
himself in the car

Chip looks at him assumes the hard stare of a criminal

CORY
Look at us

CHIP
Look at you I didn’t do shit

CORY
All you been doing is shit for
three years

Beat Chip softens

CHIP
It’s this place Look what it
makes you do What it takes from
us What it took from you

CORY
I’m not going to sit here and say
life’s been fair To either of us
This land is all we got left
Barely four thousand of us still
breathing --

CHIP
What are you -- a fucking quarter
Arapaho Only thing Indian about
you is your ex-wife and a daughter
you couldn’t protect Maybe if
youd played detective then --

Cory slams his head into the front divider before he can
finish the sentence

CORY
You gonna lecture me about
protecting our people Hmm While
you deal the shit that’s killing
‘em You know what you are --
youre just a ‘hang-around-the-
fort’ prairie nigger begging for
smallpox blankets you can sell to
your friends That’s what you sell
chief -- the smallpox of your
generation You had every chance to
get out if that’s what you wanted
Army College It was your choice
And look what you chose

Cory swings open the car door Gets out

CHIP
(Small) I met him Wanted to fight
his ass But he just took
everything I said Not like a
coward Like a man She loved
him He works security on a
drill site One of those guards
that’s where the smallpox comes
from

CORY
What’s the boyfriend’s name

oy
CHIP
Matt something

CORY
He the smallpox dealer too

CHIP
I doubt it I don’t know

CORY
Who does

Chip looks up at him

CHIP
Sam knew Why don’t you ask him

Cory looks at the criminal that used to be a boy he knew
well

CORY
Youll be talking to Sam long
before I do Chip Of that I’m
sure

CHIP
You think this is who I wanted to
be I just I get so mad I want
to fight the whole world You know
what that feels like

CORY
I do I decided to fight the
feeling instead Know why

Cory leans back into the car

CORY (CONT’D)
Because I knew the world would win

Cory closes the door Sees Ben and Jane talking They look at
him as he approaches

JANE
What did I tell you -- Did he say
anything -- never mind don’t tell

us What did he say
Cory’s eyes are steel

BEN
What
JL

CORY
You’re going out to the rigs
tomorrow morning

Cory looks at Jane as he leans into Ben Whispers --

CORY (CONTD)
Natalie’s boyfriend worked there

JANE
What Don’t tell me -- Fuck

BEN
Hmm This thing is solving
itself We’ll pick him up in the
morning and see what he’s got to
say

CORY
Were picking him up now From
three feet of snow --

BEN
Chip said that
CORY
I say that
Beat
BEN

But you don’t know it I want you
with us tomorrow

CORY
You don’t catch a wolf searching
where he might be

Cory looks out over the snowmobile tracks leading through the
snow Shadows fill their slight indentations and point
toward the mountains like an arrow

CORY (CONT’D)
You search where he’s been and
he’s been here

EXT WILMA LAMBERT’S HOUSE -- NIGHT
Cory stands at the door his breath frosting in front of him

Knocks softly Knows she’1ll never hear that tries a little
louder
Ze

A light comes on The door opens Wilma stands there in a
robe For an instant she seems worried about how she must
look then remembers issues far more grave surround them

CORY
Hi

WILMA
You okay

CORY

I been better

WILMA
Brings everything back doesn’t it
CORY
Yeah
She shakes her head
Silence
WILMA

You and Ben and this little FBI
girl formed your own posse to go
solve it all I hear

CORY
I’m just trying to help

WILMA
You won’t get the answers you’re
looking for No matter what you
find

CORY
This isn’t about Em --

WILMA
Don’t you say her name

Her venom brings out his

CORY
I didn’t kill her Wilma

WILMA
Yes you did We both did We
looked away We let our guard down
and this place snatched her from
us

(MORE )
WILMA (CONTD)
We have one chance left at this
and I for one will not rest a
second until he is grown and living
very far from here Where it’s
never cold and your baby doesn’t--

She fights it back Calms herself

Beat

WILMA (CONTD)
If doing this gives you some sort
of closure I’m happy for you
Closure for me will be Casey
married and happy with a family of
his own

CORY
Then what

WILMA
Good night Cory

She closes the door

EXT CORY LAMBERT’S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Janes SUV pulls up as Cory hauls hay into the corral

tosses it into the trough Walks toward Jane’s SUV

She rolls down her window

JANE
Matt Rayburn Did you know him

CORY
That the man in the snow

JANE
His fingerprints are in the
database -- he was enrolled at the

Police Academy in Rock Springs
Supposed to begin in April Worked
as a security officer for a drill
station out here

CORY
You wanna come in

JANE
Do you mind
CORY
Come on

He turns and walks to the house She shuts down the SUV and
follows

INT CORY LAMBERT’S HOUSE -- A MOMENT LATER

Jane looks around the living room Spots reloading equipment
on the dining room table The silver-colored rifle lays on a
towel placed over the coffee table -- stretched out like a
snake

Her hand goes to her sidearm checking that it’s still there

She sees numerous photos of Casey and the mini-shrine on the
mantle Looks at the girl’s picture

CORY (0S)
I got milk coffee and tap water

JANE
Tap water’s fine Thanks

She steps closer to the photo

CORY (0S)
That’s my daughter

She turns caught

CORY (CONT’D)
She passed on three years ago

She figured as much buts feigns surprise anyway

JANE
I’m sorry

CORY
You wanna ask how don’t you

JANE
I do But I won’t

Beat

CORY
I was working as an outfitter out
of Pinedale There was a big snow
and I found myself with a night
off so I grabbed a motel room and
told my wife to come up

(MORE)
1D-

CORY (CONTD)

Just her -- You get precious little
romance with two kids and a job
that keeps you in the mountains
half the year Emily was
sixteen Casey was five You could
trust her She was a good girl
We lived out on the Rez not far
from her parents Should’ve made
‘em stay with Wilma’s folks I
guess word got out that we were out
of town and some school friends
came over Then more came over

He looks up at Emily’s photo on the mantle

CORY (CONT’D)
Then some people came that weren’t
her friends Get together turned
into quite a party and then I
don’t know

He looks around like he might sit -- might need something to
lean on to continue Decides to tell it where he stands

CORY (CONT’D)
A lot I don’t want to know It
was Natalie that called us the next
day Told us Emily was missing
They were best friends so
Natalie was worried She had a
right to be

Cant go any further on his feet He sits on the couch Jane
doesn’t move an inch

CORY (CONTD)

You try to be so careful try to
plan for everything Emily was such
a good girl we just let our
guard down You’1ll have kids

some day and let me tell you

Jane you can’t blink For eighteen-
years Not once

Cory swallows the pain Looks up at his daughter on the
mantle Then to his feet

CORY (CONTD)
Some guy was moving his sheep near
Wind River He’s the one who found
her Twenty something miles from
our house How she got there What
happened -- I don’t know

(MORE)
CORY (CONT’D)
Couldnt find out much from the
autopsy cuz the (he sucks in a
pained breath) Coyotes had been at
her pretty good

He looks right at her

CORY (CONTD)
And I’ve been killing those sons of
bitches ever since

Jane tries to find something to say -- anything -- but
there’s nothing All she can think to utter is

JANE
Can you point me toward your --

CORY
Yeah right down the hall

She walks down the hall to the bathroom Closes herself in

Stares at herself in the mirror -- not a decade older than
Natalie was than Emily would be Splashes water on her face
Leans against the counter relishing a moment without
tension terror or heartache Steels herself and opens the
door

She walks out and notices a poem framed and hanging on the
wall She reads the heading -- A MEADOW IN MY PERFECT WORLD
She reads the poem
Cory walks up leans beside her
CORY (CONT’D)

She got accepted to a summer

program for creative writing at

Colorado State That’s what got her

in
Jane looks at him

JANE
She wrote this to you

And for the first time there is a crack in the steel

CORY
I don’t know who she wrote it to

Beat
He disappears into the living room She follows

CORY (CONTD)
I like to think it was me

before him

Beat

JANE
I don’t know what the Hanson boy
told you but I don’t want to
stumble into something like today
if I can help it If he told you
something I need to know

CORY
He told me one of those guards
sells ‘em meth Which one I don’t
know Also told me her boyfriend
worked security for West-Central

CORY (CONT’D)
You could’ve called for that

JANE
I wanted to know why you’re helping
me What your motivation was
(Gentle) Now I do

Cory smiles

CORY
Didn’t trust me

JANE
Didn’t trust how good you are at
it

She works her way to the door

JANE (CONTD)
Is it possible to not drive the
snowmobiles eighty-miles an hour
tomorrow

CORY
Sure if you don’t mind landing in
a ditch you could’ve sailed over

JANE
Great

Stands
18-6

She offers him a smile and leaves Cory returns to the task
of making rifle rounds Places one of the giant bullets on an
ELECTRONIC SCALE The reading says 544 GRAINS

He takes a FILE expertly shaves the bullet down Places it
back on the scale 540 GRAINS Perfect

He seats it in the machine pulls the lever driving the

bullet into the casing He holds up the round Studies it
This bullet has a home and Cory is close to finding it

EXT FREMONT COUNTY SHERIFF’S STATION -- MORNING

Cory pulls into the parking lot snowmobile in tow Two
TRIBAL POLICE VEHICLES are parked by Jane’s SUV and a
SHERIFF’S PICK UP TRUCK two SHERIFF’S DEPUTIES leaning
beside it ALL HOOKED TO TRAILERS CARRYING SNOWMOBILES

Jane Ben two BIA POLICE and two SHERIFF’S DEPUTIES -- CARL
and EVAN stand in a circle bouncing in place fighting off
the cold their breath rising from their mouths like smoke
Cory steps out Walks to them

BEN
It’s a cold one today

Cory barely notices

CORY
Below zero I bet

BEN
Six below (Points to the
mountains) Colder out there

Cory studies him

CORY
You’re shaking worse than her

Looking at Jane that’s debatable Evan walks up to Cory

EVAN
What are you doing here bud

CORY
In case you wander off I’m here to
track you down

Evan laughs
BEN
We heard from a reliable source one
of West-Central’s security officers
may be supplying meth on the Rez

CARL
The nervous one

They all chuckle
BEN
Eyes peeled is the point Everyone
ready

They move to their cars Jane looks at Cory

JANE
If you find anything radio us

CORY
I will You do the same

She offers him a smile It isn’t returned -- he is a hunter
today no room for anything else

Everyone moves to their vehicles as the sun crests the
mountains kissing the land that surrounds them

EXT HIGHWAY 789 -- DAY

The procession moves down the empty highway

WE MOVE ABOVE THEM -- PULLING AWAY The land is white in
every direction

WE PULL HIGHER UNTIL THE MOUNTAINS COME INTO VIEW THE CARS
MERE SPECS BELOW US

ANOTHER ANGLE --

Sitting low beside the highway frostbitten sagebrush blowing
in and out of view -- we hear the vehicles approaching
Rubber attacking road Whining Humming Louder Nothing ever
sounded less natural

The vehicles race past us in a blur snow swirling in their
wake
BU

EXT HIGHWAY -- CONT

Cory pulls over in front of Sam Littlefeather’s place now
surrounded in YELLOW POLICE TAPE He begins unstrapping his
snowmobile as the other vehicles push farther down the
highway

He puts on his white camo as the whine of rubber on frozen
road fades into the distance

EXT HIGHWAY 789 -- DAY

WE PULL OVER STOP EVERYONE GETS OUT

In the distance DRILL RIGS and TRAILERS can be seen Though
miles away they stand out like blisters in this white world

Snowmobiles are unloaded and mounted Engines scream as they
are started Ben fires his snowmobile looks back at Jane

BEN
Get on
She looks at him
JANE
Getting really tired of these
things
BEN

Oh come on You’re a Florida girl
right Just like those jet-skis
ain’t it

She climbs on behind him

BEN (CONT’D)
If there was an easier way to
travel snow we’d be doing it

JANE
Let’s get it over with (Looks at
her bare hands) Shit Forgot to
bring gloves You mind

He rises out of the seat She places her hands down and he
sits on them Smiles

BEN
See All sorts of perks to this
deal
Gl

JANE
- Yeah

She tries not to but can’t help smiling either

All six snowmobiles take off toward the rigs blowing smoke
and spitting snow

EXT -- WEST-CENTRAL DRILL STATION TWENTY-TWO -- DAY

A DOZEN DRILLS rise from the earth ENORMOUS GALVANIZED
PIPING undulates above and below the snow like a steel
serpent

TELEPHONE POLES have been sunk every thirty feet WIRES criss-
cross from them SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS are mounted to each

Four MOBILE HOMES are lined one after the other away from us

TWO GIANT CYLINDER TANKS sit to our left Beyond them is a
larger Mobile Structure -- all wires lead here

A MAN ON A SNOWMOBILE APPROACHES US As he gets closer we
can see he wears a NAVY PARKA WITH A BADGE ON THE RIGHT CHEST
POCKET

He stops His name is CURTIS 40’s burly but clean cut
professional and very friendly He has a large bruise on his
cheek

CURTIS
Good morning Can I help you
BEN
Matt Rayburn work here
CURTIS
Yeah do you know where he is
BEN
-- Bout to ask you the same
question
CURTIS

He had a fight with his girlfriend
a few days ago she ran off and he
went after her We haven’t seen him
since

JANE
When was that
CURTIS
Three days ago Heck we didn’t
know what to do -- waiting to hear

back from corporate about whether
to write up his termination papers
or call you guys

SECURITY OFFICER
Everything okay

CURTIS
They’re here about Matt --

SECURITY OFFICER
You find him -- is he okay

JANE
What happened to you guys

SECURITY OFFICER
What’s that

JANE
Pretty torn up

CURTIS
Hit a pine branch doing sixty and
see what happens to you

SECURITY OFFICER
We run the property line twice
daily Comes with the territory

BEN
You should try a face shield

CURTIS
Oh I requested helmets My
supervisor said “But snow’s soft
ain’t it” Corporate’s in Texas
what can I tell you

Everyone has a chuckle at that

EVAN
Matt bunked here on the property

CURTIS
Yep we all do

GL

Jane and Ben look at Curtis who seems genuinely concerned
Another snowmobile pulls up carrying another security
officer He steps up -- we can’t help but notice the
scratches that run down his face
BS

EVAN
Can we see where he stayed
Beat
CURTIS
Sure (Stepping off his snowmobile)
I’11 walk you up
Jane looks over the two security guards -- well dressed web

belts with pistols flashlights hand cuffs And beat to
shit

They seem professional and courteous She strains to pick out
the bad apple

TWO MORE SECURITY OFFICERS WALK UP THROUGH THE SNOW

She looks them over as well all of their faces torn and
bruised

The entire group begins moving off toward the trailers

EXT MOUNTAINS -- DAY

Cory works his snowmobile through terrain not meant for
machines -- he takes it almost vertically up the side of a
mountain We move past the area where Matt’s body was found
surrounded by POLICE TAPE He drives past looks for tracks
There are none

Continues east over white powder Judging from the snow he
is the first living thing to traverse this land since the
storm

Then he stops Looks down --

LION TRACKS

HE SHUTS DOWN THE ENGINE STEPS OFF

He pulls his silver-colored bear killer from its case and
follows the tracks around a bend

He walks across what looks to be an endless plain of white
surrounded by dark pines tasked with containing it

He comes to a rock outcropping that creates something rarely
viewed during winter in Wyoming -- an area with no snow

THE CARCASS OF A DEER almost completely devoured lays in
front of it He raises his rifle moves toward the shallow
cave
v4
He stops Listens Hears shallow breathing Cocks the hammer
steps closer

Stares at the black hole nature cut into the side of the
mountain Pulls a flashlight from his pocket points it
toward the cavern --

THREE SETS OF RED EYES STARE BACK

He lowers the light a bit -- A MOUNTAIN LION AND HER TWO CUBS
STARE BACK

CORY
This is the end of the road for
you
He presses his face to the stock Notices something

MUD SPRAYED ALONG THE CAVERN WALL

He steps closer rifle still at the ready Looks at the mud
spray then looks down

He walks toward the cavern The big cat curls her back as
Cory kneels down not ten feet from her We follow his eyes
to

A SNOWMOBILE TRACK CUT INTO THE MUD

He stands up looks out from the track and sees a slight
indentation in the snow leading down the mountain He
follows it

Cory walks to a clearing pulls his BINOCULARS to his face
THROUGH BINOCULARS WE SEE

Tracks barely visible leading down the mountain to the open
plains Toward a large DRILL RIG STATION He glasses the
station --

Jane Ben and the officers walking alongside the security
guards

CORY (CONT’D)
Oh no

Cory shakes his head -- knows what they don’t turns back
Finds himself in front of the lion hole Looks in and talks
loud

CORY (CONT’D)
Youre one lucky bitch it’s today I
find you
BD

The lion responds with a panicked hiss her kits huddled
beside her Cory turns and pushes down the hill through the
snow

EXT WEST-CENTRAL DRILL STATION -- CONT

Jane Ben and the officers trudge through the snow with
Curtis beside them

We notice that the other security officers have lagged back
and are now walking behind them

CURTIS
So did something happen Do you
know where he is

Jane studies him As genuine as he seems she doesn’t want to
play her cards not yet

JANE
That’s what we’re trying to find
out His girlfriend filed a missing
person’s report

CURTIS
How can that be I thought you guys
found her in a snowdrift right
before the storm

She turns to stone

JANE
Excuse me

CURTIS

I heard it go out over the radio
when you guys found her

Jane stares at him
JANE
I don’t remember her name being
used over the radio

Beat

CURTIS
Then maybe you weren’t listening --

EVAN (0S)
What the fuck are you doing

Jane turns to find Evan with his hand on his pistol
Bo

SECURITY OFFICER
What

EVAN
Why are you flanking me

SECURITY OFFICER
What are you talking about --

EVAN
Fuck do you think I’m talking about
-- you got us on three sides
dickhead

And so they do -- the security team has effectively
surrounded the police

SECURITY OFFICER
Get your hand off that weapon this
is private property --

Evan unsnaps his holster and pulls his pistol free

SECURITY OFFICER (CONT’D)
WHOA EASY MAN

Evan trains his weapon on the security guard as EVERYONES
hand goes to their weapon

SECURITY OFFICER (CONT’D)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING PUT IT DOWN

BEN
Evan

EVAN
Turn away from me and drop to your
knees

SECURITY OFFICER
Fuck you this is a BIA lease on
reservation land asshole -- you’re
breaking the law by being here --

JANE
Hey

CURTIS
This is leased land on a
reservation -- you have no

authority deputy--
EVAN
You think I don’t know what you’re
doing

Curtis steps back hand on his pistol One of the security
guards holds a MOSSBERG 590 SHOTGUN tucked to his shoulder
barrel inching up from the snow toward the officers

Emotion is overtaking reason

A security guard stands mere feet from a BIA officer both of
their hands gripping pistols

SECURITY OFFICER 2
FUCKING DO IT ASSHOLE PULL YOUR
WEAPON AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS --

BIA OFFICER
HOKA HEY WHITE BOY LET’S GO --

Jane locks eyes with Curtis who grips his pistol as well
Her hand moves to her waistband A SECURITY GUARD unsnaps
his holster

CURTIS
DEPUTY -- You have no authority
you are in violation of Federal
law lower your weapon --

EVAN
FUCK YOU YOU’RE PUTTING US INA
CROSSFIRE --
Ben the tribal officers -- hell all of them -- have their

hands on their weapons stepping back seeking a clear
shooting lane

Evan points his pistol wildly from one security guard to the
next -- the security guard with the shotgun points it at
Evan then calls to Curtis for guidance --

SECURITY OFFICER
What do I do

CURTIS
Hold your ground County Sheriffs
have no authority here tell him to
holster his weapon --

Jane realizes this misunderstanding is seconds from disaster
JANE

(Too small to be heard) I’ma
federal officer --
Be

The men scream and dance in place hands on their weapons --
it’s a mad ballet of aggression and confusion

BEN
OKAY EVERYBODY EASY --

Jane draws in a deep breath then explodes above the chaos

JANE
FBI THIS IS FEDERAL LAND AND I
AM THE AUTHORITY HERE RIGHT NOW
ALL OF YOU STAND DOWN

Everyone stands with their feet planted wide in the snow
hands on their weapons -- it’s minus twelve-degrees and they
are sweating through their coats

JANE (CONTD)
OKAY EVERYONE Slow down We’re
all working toward the same goal
- Everyone back down and move
your hands from your weapons
Slowly Look --

Jane demonstrates removing her hand from her pistol and
holding it up

Like molasses basing their speed off the speed of the man
across from them all hands move away from weapons

CURTIS
Keep these assholes in check We’re
just doing our job lady --

EVAN
When we show up your job’s over
asshole --
BEN
EVAN
CARL
Every one of you step to your left--
EVAN
No one behind us you understand
CURTIS
You got it (To his men) Guys step

my way

The security guards all move left even with the police
OY

CURTIS (CONTD)
Alright let’s all just take a deep
breath

Jane looks back at Evan still swinging his pistol between
targets

JANE
Evan Deputy Holster your
weapon

Evan looks at her amazed

EVAN
You didn’t see it

JANE
Right now or you’re under arrest
you understand me

Evan looks over the men as he lowers his pistol

EVAN
(Defeated)You didn’t see it

Jane looks over the officers The security detail Knows
someone must take control before they all kill each other
She turns on Curtis and makes an even bigger show of laying
into him

JANE
Make no mistake who’s running
things here I don’t give a shit
what billionaire owns this dump --
I am the biggest dog on the porch
and when I say jump you don’t ask
how high -- you just start fucking
hopping You got me

CURTIS
Yes ma’am

JANE

CURTIS
Okay

He starts walking The whole tense lot of them follow
Yue

EXT MOUNTAINS NEAR DRILL STATION TWENTY-TWO -- DAY

Cory has dropped down from the mountains Stops his
snowmobile Looks through binoculars at the camp Sees the
tension-filled mass ambling toward the last trailer in the
camp

Cory pulls his two-way radio from his coat

CORY
(Into the radio) Ben Ben you

copy
He’s a little more than a mile away He takes the rifle from

his shoulder and steps off the snowmobile Begins racing
toward the camp

EXT MATT’S TRAILER -- WEST-CENTRAL STATION -- CONT
Everyone stops before the trailer No one trusting anyone

CURTIS
This is his trailer

BEN

CURTIS
Yeah Me and Pete Mickens

Cory’s voice filters through Ben’s radio He steps away as he
speaks into it

JANE
Is Pete in there now

CURTIS
He’s sleeping He has night shift

Beat

Jane steps up on the aluminum steps that rise to the door
She knocks then steps down

INT MATT’S TRAILER -- WEST-CENTRAL STATION -- CONT

WE ARE IN THE TRAILER’S BATHROOM STEAM FROM THE SHOWER HAS
CLOUDED THE MIRROR

We hear knocking Push open the bathroom door We move
through the trailer through the kitchen and toward the
front door A HAND REACHES FOR THE DOOR LATCH TURNS IT
Yl

The hand pulls it open

WE ARE IN A FLASHBACK --

We look out and see standing outside the trailer NATALIE
HANSON DRESSED IN WHITE SWEAT PANTS AND A BABY-BLUE COAT

Her beautiful face smiles back at us
FROM HER POV WE SEE --
Matt Rayburn 26 handsome wearing only a towel

MATT
Can I help you

NATALIE
Yes I’m looking for my knight in
shining armor I believe this is
his trailer

He smiles
MATT
I’m a bit short on armor at the

moment

She snaps her feet out of a pair of SNOWSHOES climbs up the
stairs and wraps her arms around him

NATALIE
I don’t mind

MATT
I didn’t hear your carriage
outside

NATALIE

Yes well My carriage wanted to
catch the eight o’clock show in
Lander so she dropped me off at
the turn-out

He drops out of character for a moment

MATT
You walked that far in the snow

She leans into him

NATALIE
You’re worth it
Y2e

He kisses her Pulls her inside and slams the door closed

INT MATT’S TRAILER -- BEDROOM -- LATER

Matt traces his finger over her breasts She stares up at him
as if nothing else on earth exists

His hand slips out of frame She cranes her head back --
loves the way he touches her She closes her eyes

MATT
(Soft) No Look at me

She does He rolls on top of her She fights to keep her eyes
open as he enters her

NATALIE
Tell me how you’1l take me away
from here

He gently thrusts into her She moans
MATT
A little house a little porch
where we sit
He moves back then pushes gently into her again
MATT (CONTD)
I tell you about my day and you
tell me what I forgot to buy at the
store --

She laughs Which makes her contract which makes her moan

NATALIE
And you love me still

MATT
I do

WE PUSH IN CLOSER CLOSER

Their bodies become one -- he gently moves inside her and
the pleasure of it -- the love that drives it pushes a tear
from her eye We follow it down her cheek and watch it creep
behind her

INT MATT’S TRAILER -- BEDROOM -- LATER

Natalie rests her head on his chest They stare at the
ceiling
Beat

She looks

MATT
Two more months of this place
(He looks at her) four months at
the Academy

NATALIE
Then Cheyenne

MATT
Then Cheyenne

NATALIE
Six months is so long

MATT
It’ll go by in no time
at him
NATALIE
Time’s like everything else on the
Rez in winter Frozen It’ll be

an eternity

She lays her head against him

NATALIE (CONT’D)
Don’t forget me when you’re there
please

His hand finds her cheek

We hear the sound of SNOWMOBILES They pull close We

MATT
Natalie That’s silly

NATALIE
No That’s what happens once
people make it out of here They
don’t ever look back

Joe

hear

DRUNKEN LAUGHTER Lonely men violating the night with their

noise

Matt’s face clouds

MATT
Shit The vultures have returned
Put something on babe
Y4

She hears the sounds of drunken men outside the trailer She
stands naked and steps into her sweat pants Grabs her
coat Puts it over her naked torso

NATALIE
Where’s my shirt

We hear the TRAILER DOOR FLY OPEN

MATT
(Whispers) Just get back in bed
they’re gonna bust in here you
know it

She climbs back in bed They listen to the drunk men stumble
through the trailer laughing

VOICE
Smells like sex in here
We hear stumbling toward the canvas door -- fashioned like an
accordion -- that separates them from the rest of the
trailer
MATT
Guys Come on Leave us alone
okay

The accordion door is thrown open PETE MICKENS 30S
skinny dark eyes stares drunkenly at them Behind him we
see CURTIS

PETE
What’re you two doing

MATT
Come on

Pete stumbles in and sits on the edge of the bed Bloodshot
eyes Big smile Looks at Natalie

PETE
Hello there

NATALIE
Hi Pete

He looks at her form under the sheet
PETE
Wonder what you got on under those

sheets

The trailer door opens We hear more men enter
Yo

NATALIE
A fluffy down coat Not very sexy

PETE
Fluffy sounds good to me

Matt sits up Pete looks at his bare torso

MATT
Pete Come on Go to your room

PETE
You naked Matt What have you guys
been doing

MATT
Get out of here

PETE
Whooooo

Curtis laughs We see shadows move behind him TWO MORE MEN
PEER IN

SECURITY OFFICER
Well well well What have we
here

Natalie is starting to get nervous Matt is starting to get
pissed

PETE
Come on Let me have a little peak

He moves to lift the sheet and Matt slaps his hand Pete does
it again and Matt slaps it again

To Pete this is rapidly becoming a game He holds up his
hands gesturing surrender then yanks the sheet hard
pulling it down below Natalie’s waist

We see flashes of her skin

Matt reaches over and grabs at the sheet as Natalie rolls
away from Pete pulling the coat closed

Her ass hangs half-out of her sweats The gawking men see it
before Matt wins control of the sheet

The look on the men’s faces turns from humor to hunger in an
instant

NATALIE
STOP IT PLEASE
yo

PETE
Don’t bullshit me girl youre
sticking your little ass out like a
flag --

Matt’s fist slams into his chin knocking him backwards

MATT
Get the fuck out

Curtis laughs Pete doesn’t

CURTIS
Pete let’s go He doesn’t want to
share

PETE

Oh I can see that
We look into Pete’s cold eyes

PETE (CONTD)
But sharing is what friends do --

Pete launches himself over Natalie and punches Matt in the
face Doesn’t stop with one A fight breaks out on the bed --
right on top of Natalie -- who screams and struggles to get
free

Pete has the leverage punching furiously Natalie grabs Pete
by his hair and pulls back Hard

Curtis and the others cheer and laugh

Matt slams his fist into Pete’s jaw with such force he knocks
both Pete and Natalie off the bed

Natalie’s coat flies open -- exposing her breasts to the men
that loom over her

Matt rises and punches wild Rocks Curtis with a shot who
yells and hits back

It is quickly escalating to a point of no return

CURTIS
Hey

MATT
Why didn’t you stop him --

CURTIS
Pete’s just fucking around --
SECURITY OFFICER
Youre acting like a pussy over
this prairie nigger --

And that’s all the insult Natalie can take she punches and
scratches furiously at the security guard

NATALIE
FUCK YOU

Curtis shoves her back -- his hands touching bare skin Grabs
her breasts as she rakes him with her nails Pete still on
the ground reaches up and pulls her sweats to her ankles
yanking her to the ground

Matt kicks Pete in the jaw knocking him unconscious He
throws a punch over Natalie hitting Curtis in the face --
the other two security guards race in beating Matt with
their flashlights

They punch and kick and pound -- in a drunken feral orgy of
no reason

WE DROP DOWN TO NATALIE -- FEET STOMPING HER OVER HER ALL
AROUND HER AS SHE STRUGGLES TO STAND

We hear METAL MEETING BONE Matt falls down to our eye level
an enormous gash in his forehead Eyes look at her but no
recognition in them

Natalie screams tries to fight through this forest of men’s
legs-- she looks up and sees Curtis’s flashlight slamming
down toward her

The world goes dark

Like a SLOW STROBE images pulse through the black --

WE COME TO FOR A MOMENT look up See the ceiling of the
trailer

The world goes dark then pulses into --

PETE’S BONY ASS moves back and forth thrusting Tan legs on
either side of him spread wide

The world goes dark then pulses into --

CHEAP CARPET So close we can follow the weave of the
thread

The world goes dark then pulses into

NATALIE’S FACE PRESSED INTO THE CARPET
Jobe

Curtis’s face lowers into frame -- ecstasy etched across it
CURTIS IS RIPPED OUT OF FRAME

In a daze Natalie rolls over Looks up Matt blasts past us -
- slamming Curtis into the wall shaking the entire trailer
with the impact

MEN LEAP OVER US

Natalie crawls out of the room pulling her sweatpants up as
she goes

She crawls through the kitchen area -- chaos leaking from the
room behind her She finds her feet Uses them

She stumbles toward the door dizzy Struggles to zip her
coat -- looks back to the bedroom and the men that tear her
love apart She moves toward the trailer door reaches for
the handle

BACK TO PRESENT --

EXT MATT’S TRAILER -- WEST-CENTRAL STATION -- DAY

STEP AWAY FROM THE --

A SHOTGUN BLASTS through the door -- blowing Jane off the
steps

BEN FIRES HIS PISTOL AT THE DOOR AS HE RUNS TOWARD HER
yy

At once everyone pulls pistols and fires into each other --
from ten feet away

Pete swings the trailer door open pumping shells through the
shotgun -- spraying the police officers Ben fires rounds
into his chest knocking him back

Deputies fall security guards fall -- at ten feet apart no
one is spared

ANGLE ON --

Jane on her back -- desperate to draw a breath She emits an
airless moan then frantically attempts to suck in air
Buckshot has torn into her neck and face and blown her coat
and vest to shreds

Blood covers her neck like a bib
TIME SLOWS

So desperate to breathe her body convulses -- pulling her
upward like a sit-up then blasts her back into the snow --
forcing air into her lungs

She blinks Feels her senses returning Looks at Ben firing
rounds above her Shell casings rain down on her She watches
bullets SLAM INTO BEN’S BULLET PROOF VEST -- thrusting him
out of frame

She breathes in again -- sucking in strength-- and adrenaline
overtakes her

She turns on her side firing into a man’s legs He screams
and falls He looks directly at her and she sends a round
into his forehead rolling him over dead

-- A AR-15 ASSAULT RIFLE POPS OUT THE TRAILER’S KITCHEN
WINDOW spraying rounds on the police -- They rip through Ben
and pound Jane in her shoulder and through her vest

The rounds tear through the officers cutting them to the
ground The fight is over as quickly as it started

Men lay writhing on the ground Of the dozen men in the
fight only Curtis still stands

A SECURITY OFFICER pulls himself from the snow blood pulsing
from numerous wounds He looks over the bodies of the
officers Sees Evan whose legs have been tattered Evan
struggles to rise even though his legs were almost amputated
by the rounds that cut through him
The security guard stumbles toward Evan who raises his
pistol at the man who now stands over him

EVAN
Let’s go --

THEY BOTH FIRE sending round after round into each other

A bullet finds Evan’s head unplugging him

The security officer falls back then sits in the snow in a
bloody daze Right next to the man he just killed He places

a hand on Evan’s dead chest and pats him with an absent
affection

CURTIS
PETE
Jane looks up at the blue sky So tired She looks across
the snow -- it is painted red
She looks to her right -- Ben’s lifeless eyes stare back

Beyond him all the men she came with Dead
She hears movement Talking

CURTIS (OS) (CONT’D)
You okay

SECURITY OFFICER 2 (0S)
I’m hit

CURTIS (0S)
Who isn’t (Yells to the trailer)
Pete -- you good
ANGLE ON

PETE drawing in large gulps of air bullets have torn
through his shirt and flattened against his Kevlar vest

PETE
We’re good How many we got down

CURTIS (0OS)
Two that won’t get up

SECURITY OFFICER 2
No I’m getting up

But he makes no attempt to do so
1AVUL

Curtis walks to a BIA OFFICER who struggles to turn over
When he does it’s only to see Curtis fire a round into his
forehead

Curtis turns Sees Jane looking at him Starts walking toward
her She breathes heavy -- here it comes

She tries to raise her pistol His foot prevents her

CURTIS
My God the women out here are
spunky

He raises his pistol Something catches his eye He looks up
Sees something

He squints -- it appears the snow itself is standing to face
him

The muzzle flash from Cory’s rifle shoots five-feet out the
barrel

The bullet punches a hole in Curtis’s chest we can almost see
through Punches a hole through the trailer behind him
Curtis is thrown back into the trailer dead before he left
his feet

Jane rolls over and crawls underneath the trailer

The one security guard who still stands looks out over the
plains Sees nothing

SECURITY OFFICER
You see where that came from

PETE
(Shouting from the trailer) No

The security officer strains to see Looks to his friend
bleeding in the snow

SECURITY OFFICER
Can you stand up

SECURITY OFFICER 2
I don’t know

SECURITY OFFICER
Well you better figure it out cuz
we’re not done

The wounded man struggles to his feet Dizzy He looks out
over the plains Turns back and sees -- Cory standing fifty
yards from him
The security guard doesn’t even have the presence of mind to
raise his pistol just points his finger in Cory’s direction

Cory has fired and ejected the second round before the first
one hits the ground Both men are thrown backward into the
snow

The men in the trailer return fire but Cory is gone

INT MATT’S TRAILER -- WEST-CENTRAL STATION -- CONT

SECURITY OFFICER 3
(Drawing calming breaths) Okay

Cory’s bullet punches through the trailer through the sink
through the security guard and through the wall behind him
knocking a six inch hole that bleeds light into the room

The man is pulled backward in the bullet’s wake falling flat
on the floor

Pete drops to the floor crawls to the bedroom He climbs
over the bed and kicks out the window Climbs out

ANGLE ON
JANE Under the trailer

She empties her gun at Pete as he runs They punch into his
Kevlar Vest and knock him to the ground

He stands immediately and continues running
She rolls on her back shivers

Cory kneels down -- offers her a hand She takes it Pulls
her out
CORY
How bad are you hit

JANE

(Through chattering teeth) I don’t
know

Cory helps her to her feet

CORY

He lifts her up and carries her inside

INT MATT’S TRAILER -- WEST-CENTRAL STATION -- CONT

Cory sets her on a couch Heads to the bedroom returns with
the bedding Wraps it around her shoulders

CORY
I need to have a look

She nods and he unzips the coveralls runs his hand inside
Pulls it out looks at it -- no blood Runs his hand along
her sides her belly feels something warm

Looks at his hand -- blood but not an alarming amount

CORY (CONT’D)
I think a few rounds got through
but only in pieces You’re not
bleeding too bad

He looks at her neck this wound is more severe

CORY (CONTD)
This one ain’t great

He takes some of the sheet Presses it against the wound

CORY (CONT’D)
Hold that there

She does She looks at him

EXT WIND RIVER MOUNTAINS -- DAY

WE RUN THROUGH THE SNOW We stumble Breathe heavy Stand up
and continue

We hear the whine of an engine in the distance It echoes
through the trees -- no way to know where it comes from

WE LOOK AT PETE STANDING IN THE SNOW TREES ALL AROUND HIM

He turns in every direction trying to pinpoint the sound of
the machine echoing through the mountains

The sound stops The forest is silent Pete pulls a pistol
from its holster and continues marching through the frozen
forest

He freezes Hears something -- a gnawing sound He turns

A PORCUPINE IS CLIMBING A NAKED ASPEN TREE

It chews the bark Stops Looks at Pete -- like any animal
the porcupine can sense the hunted Can smell the fear The
porcupine’s button eyes show no sympathy -- better you than
me

When Pete turns he finds CORY STANDING IN FRONT OF HIM

Pete screams like a startled child The butt of Cory’s rifle
slams into Pete’s chin knocking him backward

EXT GANNET PEAK -- WIND RIVER MOUNTAINS -- DAY

The sun sits low in the Western sky We are well above the

treeline Ragged mountains cut the skyline in every
direction
LUD

Pete lays in the snow blindfolded Hands bound The
blindfold is ripped off His hands cut free

Cory stands over him

CORY
Know where you are

PETE
«e- No

Pete shivers in the snow his breath crystallizing the
instant it’s exhaled

CORY
That’s Gannet Peak Highest
mountain in Wyoming

We look around Deep in the land of nothing Only bitter
cold

CORY (CONTD)
On the hottest day in August
there’s a foot of snow Today

Cory looks at him

CORY (CONT’D)
It’s too cold to snow

PETE
Okay Okay Let’s just --
let’s talk for a minute

CORY
Alright

Pete’s teeth chatter -- he looks down at his feet -- NO
SHOES

PETE
Wha -- WHAT THE FUCK (Sobs) --
what the what --

CORY
I give you a minute and this is how
you spend it -- cussing and crying
PETE
Listen okay I’ve made

mistakes I’ve I’ve
Beat

Pete can barely speak he is shivering so hard

Cory nods

He nods

CORY
What What did you do I’m not a
policeman -- tell me the truth and
Ill give you a chance

PETE
Alright Just You know what
it’s like Stuck out in this frozen
hell -- nothing to do No nothing

No women no fun Just fucking
snow and silence

CORY
My people have been stuck in this
shit for a century Snow and
silence is the only thing that
hasn’t been taken from us You
took from us too didn’t you

PETE
I don’t -- how did I --

CORY
You have a little taste did you
Got lonely Got drunk

CORY (CONTD)
Then what did you get

CORY (CONTD)
If you did it be a man and say it
Say ‘I raped her’

PETE
I raped her

CORY
Now say ‘her boyfriend tried to
stop me and we beat him to death’

CORY (CONTD)
Nod won’t cut it Not today Say
it

PETE
We-we-we d-d- we beat him
CORY
Fair enough

Cory stands Grabs his rifle Slings it over his shoulder

CORY (CONTD)

Let’s go
PETE

Wha -- wha -- where
CORY

You get the same chance she got

PETE
What did she -- what did she get

CORY
Stand up big boy I’m a man of my
word If you can make it to the
highway you’re a free man

Pete stands up Looks around -- they are so deep in the
mountains so high up the valley isn’t even visible

PETE
Where -- where’s the highway

He looks at Cory eyes wide

CORY
You know how far it is from that
drill camp to where Natalie was
found -- almost six miles
Barefoot That’s a warrior (Looks
the freezing man over) I doubt
youll make it six hundred feet
Still we should make this fair

Cory walks up pulling a large hunting knife from its sheath
and slices Pete’s parka open down the middle

CORY (CONT’D)
There we go

PETE
I don’t understand What do you
want me to do

Cory steps close to him

CORY
I want you to run
1U5

Cory places the muzzle of his rifle beside Pete’s ear Pulls
the trigger

The gun is so loud we expect the mountain to collapse
Instead it is only Pete’s eardrum that erupts Pete screams
as blood funnels out of it He covers his ear and runs like
his life depends on it -- which it does

Cory pulls a ski mask over his face climbs on his snowmobile
and goes after him

Pete runs -- bare feet slamming into snow He screams looks
for a way down the steep mountain sees none Looks back
Cory is right behind him

He runs faster arms flinging wildly Suddenly half of him
disappears --

THE SNOW IS SO DEEP IT COVERS HIM TO HIS WAIST

Pete looks back at Cory who fires a round right over his
head He shrieks in terror and pushes further into the snow

He breathes harder deeper As he exhales a thin mist of
blood spews out

Cory slows down let’s Pete get distance gives him hope

WE WATCH PETE FADE INTO THE MOUNTAIN -- The man becoming a
speck in a world of white

Pete FUMBLES weak -- blood is frozen to the side of his
face

Cory stops Watches him Seconds ache by Sees him slow down
stumble then fall He doesn’t get up

ANGLE ON
Pete lays in the snow coughing -- gasping -- freezing from
the inside out He rolls on his back The sky is so close he

can almost reach out and touch it

He reaches his arm up stretching Stays like this No
breath No movement He is gone

Cory turns the snowmobile east and begins the long ride home

INT FREMONT COUNTY HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

Jane lays in a hospital bed IV tubes running to and from
her
She stares at the ceiling too tired to cry but knowing it’s
coming She feels a presence Looks to the door Cory stands
there

CORY
You made it

JANE
So did you

CORY
I bet this ain’t how they sell
those bulletproof vests in the
brochure is it

She chuckles and pain runs through her body

JANE
Don’t make me laugh

CORY
Shouldnt joke It saved your life

JANE
You saved my life

CORY
You’re a tough girl Jane You
saved your own life

JANE
Let’s be honest I just got lucky

He sits beside her

CORY
Luck don’t live out here Luck
lives in the city Whether someone
runs the stoplight whether your
bank’s the one that gets robbed
whether someone’s dialing their
cellphone when they come to a
crosswalk Luck is winning or
losing Out here you survive or
you surrender That’s determined by
your strength You spirit Wolves
don’t kill unlucky deer they kill
weak ones

He leans forward
CORY (CONT’D)

You fought for your life And now
you get to leave with it
He sits back Stretches his legs out gets comfortable She
realizes why he’s here -- and it wasn’t to make sure she’s
alright It’s to watch over her until she’s able to watch
over herself

He reaches into a stack of magazines grabs one Flips
through it

JANE
I know what you’re doing

But she doesn’t object

CORY
I’1ll read something to you “How
to know if he’s into you -- ten

signs Number one he looks you in
the eye when he speaks” You’re
supposed to do that anyway ain’t
you I don’t think that one’s
reliable

She can’t help but laugh can’t help but be moved by the
gesture But laughter brings pain and thoughts of the day
and all she saw All she endured Laughter turns to tears

She fights them at first but Cory’s hand finds hers
Squeezes unleashing all she’s fought to contain

She cries like it’s her first time to do so purging the
demons that ravage her mind and heart He is neither
uncomfortable nor surprised He knew she needed this

We watch her sob as he stretches over the hospital bed
caressing her battered hand

EXT BULL LAKE -- WIND RIVER INDIAN RESERVATION -- DAY

We look out over a frozen lake Dead center of it is a small
bright green ICE FISHING HUT A SNOWMOBILE parked beside it

We PUSH toward it

INT ICE FISHING HUT -- CONT

Cory and Casey sit on little stools holding fishing poles
Their lines disappears into a 12 inch hole cut into the ice

They stare at the hole

CORY
You want your sandwich
Lil

CASEY
No
Beat
CASEY (CONTD)
Can I have some of your coffee
CORY
No They say it’1l stunt your
growth
CASEY
What’s that mean
CORY
It’ll make you short
Beat
CASEY
I’m already short
CORY
Not as short as you’ll be if you
drink coffee
Beat
CASEY
Do you like ice fishing
CORY
Not really
Beat
CASEY
Me neither
CORY

Wanna do something else
Casey thinks about that
CASEY
Nah Don’t matter what we do so
long as we’re doing it you know
what I mean

Cory looks at him

CORY
I do
Liz

Casey smiles then looks down to the hole in the ice never
knowing what those words meant to his father But if he were
to look up and into his eyes -- as we do now -- he would
begin to understand

EXT BULL LAKE -- WIND RIVER INDIAN RESERVATION -- CONT

WE PULL AWAY FROM THE HUT

As we back away the white world dominates our view in every
direction

We RISE High above the lake watching the green hut shrink --
the only thing in this place that dares to defy the color of
winter

THE END
