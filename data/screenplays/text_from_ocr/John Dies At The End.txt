DAVID VO
Solving the following riddle will
reveal the awful secret behind the
universe assuming you do not go
utterly mad in the attempt If you
already happen to know the awful
secret behind the universe feel
free to fast-forward ahead

CU HANDS unwrap a shiny new wooden-handled HAND AX

DAVID VO (CONTD)
Let’s say you have an ax Just a
cheap one from Home Depot

EXT SNOW YARD - DAY 1

The camera pans across a snow covered yard as a brutal
winter wind whips through A strong arm is swinging the ax
chopping SOMETHING in the snow

DAVID VO
On one bitter winter day you use
said ax to behead a man Don’t
worry the man is already dead Or
maybe you should worry because
youre the one who shot him

A hand swings the axe while the other hand firmly grasps a
HEAD by the hair

DAVID VO (CONTD)
He had been a big twitchy guy with
veiny skin stretched over swollen
biceps a tattoo of a swastika
on

CU - A SWASTIKA tattoo on a blue swollen tongue poking out
of the dead mouth

DAVID VO (CONT’D)
Teeth filed into razor-sharp fangs
you know the type And you’re
chopping off his head because even
with eight bullet holes in him
youre pretty sure he’s about to
spring back to his feet and eat the
look of terror right off your face

The ax swings through one last time and on impact the wooden
handle snaps in a spray of splinters
DAVID VO (CONTD)
You now have a broken ax So after
a long night of looking for a place
to dump the man and his head you
take a trip into town with your ax
You go to the hardware store
explaining away the dark reddish
stains on the broken handle as
barbecue sauce

INT HARDWARE STORE - DAY 2

CU - DOLLAR BILLS go into a cash drawer and a brown BAG with
the end of an AX HANDLE sticking out is handed across the
counter

DAVID VO
The repaired ax sits undisturbed in
your house until the next spring
when on one rainy morning you
find in your kitchen

INT DAVE’S KITCHEN - DAY 3

cU - The newly-reconstituted ax sits in the corner of the
kitchen window - a driving rain lashes the window outside
Suddenly we swish pan to

A CREATURE that appears to be a foot-long SLUG with a BULGING
EGG SAC on its tail Its jaws bite a nearby FORK in half with
what seems like very little effort A hand grabs the ax
and

DAVID VO
You grab your trusty ax and chop
the thing into several pieces On
the last blow however

The ax strikes a METAL LEG of the overturned kitchen table
and chips out a NOTCH right in the middle of the blade

DAVID VO (CONTD)
Of course a chipped head means yet
another trip to the hardware store

INT HARDWARE STORE - DAY 4

We reprise the previous visit to the hardware store but
instead of an ax handle we are handed a shiny new AX HEAD

DAVID VO

As soon as you get home with your
newly-headed ax though

INT DAVE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY 5
BAM The front door blows open to reveal
The REANIMATED BODY OF THE DEAD GUY standing there

DAVID VO
You meet the reanimated body of the
guy you beheaded last year Only
he’s got a new head stitched on
with what looks like plastic weed
trimmer line and wears that unique
expression of “you’re the man who
killed me last winter” resentment
that one so rarely encounters in
everyday life So you brandish your
ax

The dead guy takes a long look at the weapon with his
squishy rotting eyes and in a gargly voice he screams

DEAD GUY
That’s the same ax that slayed me

DAVID VO
Is he right

CUT TO

EXT DAVE’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 6

DAVID WONG is fast asleep sprawled on the couch in his small
living room Dave is twenty-something Caucasian casually
dressed in “slacker-ware” with dark long hair Across from
him is a TELEVISION

THE TV SWITCHES ON by itself - static and white noise Dave
continues to sleep

On the TV an oddly-shaped FACE coalesces out of the static
A Michael Jackson face a face like a mask features that are
human but off Wide too-large eyes a nose not quite
centered Looking right out at Dave Watching him

Suddenly a CELL PHONE screeches Instantly the TV changes
channels and a DVD sales infomercial for “psychic” Dr Albert
Marconi appears on screen

Dave wakes oblivious to the TV He digs the phone from his
pocket glances at the number A little twinge of fear
crosses his face He disconnects the call without answering

The world is silent again save for the infomercial which
shows cosmic imagery with a “new-age” music soundtrack

Breakdown Services - Castina -— Partial Draft

We see an image of the dapper and handsome DR ALBERT MARCONI
with slicked back silver hair A deep-voiced narrator intones
solemnly

INFOMERCIAL NARRATOR
He’s a seeker of truth in an age
of fear Dr Albert Marconi
Unafraid of unseen forces swirling
around us

The phone rings again Dave closes his eyes and answers

DAVE
Hello

JOHN (0S)
Dave This is John Your pimp says
bring the crack shipment tonight
or he’ll be forced to stick you
Meet him where we buried the Korean
whore The one without the goatee

DAVE VO
That was John’s code It meant
“Bring your gear and come to my
lace as soon as you can it’s
important”

DAVE
John it’s three in the-

JOHN (0S)
-Oh and don’t forget tomorrow is
the day we kill the President

Click Dave realizes John is gone and closes his phone

DAVE VO
That last part was code for “Stop
and pick me up some cigarettes on
the way”

EXT DAVE’S SHED - NIGHT 7

Dave’s BLACK 1973 FORD BRONCO is parked next to a wooden SHED
beside his house Dave humps a duffle bag of GEAR and throws
it into the back of the Bronco

Dave moves back inside the shed and we can see in the dim
glow that it’s got a “Clubhouse of the Living Dead” vibe with
an array of strange oddball paraphernalia displayed a
STUFFED CAT with six legs two large MASON JARS containing a
hideous slug-like CREATURE and a huge yellow-striped SPIDER
and a rack of odd WEAPONRY including swords and crossbows
Dave finds what he is looking for a medieval-style TORCH and
some heavy RUBBER GLOVES

Breakdown Services - Castina -— Partial Draft
Dave tosses the stuff in the Bronco pulls a nickel-plated
9mm COLT from the gear bag and slides it into his pocket He
slams the door shut

EXT JOHN’S APARTMENT FRONT DOOR - NIGHT 8

JOHN 24 with a head of curly long hair like a deflated
Afro opens the door to his apartment and immediately
gestures toward a cute and frightened-looking YOUNG WOMAN
(Shelly) on his sofa

OHN
Dave this is Shelly She needs our
help

Shelly is 19 blank powder-blue eyes chestnut curls in a
ponytail She has a WHITE BANDAGE on her temple John steps
into his kitchen and returns to place a cup of coffee in her
hands

JOHN (CONT’D)
Shelly tell us your story

SHELLY
It’s my boyfriend He he won’t
leave me alone He’s been harassing
me for about a week My parents are
gone on vacation and I’m I’m
terrified to go home

She shakes her head apparently out of words

DAVE
Miss-
SHELLY
(barely audible)
Morris
DAVE

Ms Morris I strongly recommend a
women’s shelter They can help you
get a restraining order keep you
safe whatever There are three in
this city and I’1l be happy to
make the call-

SHELLY
-He my boyfriend I mean he’s
been dead for two months

Dave lets out a long sigh and sees John cast a little gleeful

glance his way as if to say “see how I deliver for you
Dave”

Breakdown Services - Castina -— Partial Draft
SHELLY (CONTD)
I-I didn’t know where else to go I
heard you know through a friend
of mine that you two handle um
unusual problems They say you’re
the best

DAVE
Whoever calls us “the best” has
pretty low standards

JOHN
Okay When he comes you can see
him

SHELLY
Yes I can hear him too And he
uh

She brushes the bandage on the side of her skull

DAVE
He hits you

SHELLY
Yes

DAVE

With his fist

SHELLY
Yes

John looks up from his coffee indignantly

JOHN
Man what a dick

Dave rolls his eyes and glares at John

JOHN (CONTD)
(turning professorial)
From our experience spiritual
beings that can manipulate objects
in the physical world are rare and
extremely powerful

DAVE
Look Miss I don’t want to-

JOHN
Dave I told her we would look into
it tonight I thought you and I
could head over there and show this
bastard what’s what

INT FORD BRONCO DRIVING - NIGHT 9

Shelly sits in the passenger seat as the Bronco races down a
dark road hugging herself looking blankly out the
windshield

SHELLY
So do you guys like do this a
lot

JOHN

Sometimes Been doing it for a
couple years now

SHELLY
How does somebody get into this

JOHN

There was an incident A series of
incidents I guess A dead guy
another dead guy Some drugs It’s
kind of a long story Now we can
see things Sometimes I have a
dead cat that follows me around
wondering why I never feed it Oh
and I had one hamburger that
started mooing when I ate it

(glances at Dave)
You remember that

Dave grunts says nothing

DAVE VO
It wasn’t mooing John It was
screaming

EXT SHELLY’S HOUSE - NIGHT 10

The Bronco stops in front of a simple two-story farmhouse
From the back of the Bronco Dave grabs the unlit torch and
tosses John a wide LEATHER STRAP which John slings over his
shoulder like a bandolero The strap carries a HOLSTER which
fits neatly across John’s chest containing a SAWED-OFF
SHOTGUN PISTOL

John steps up on the porch and pushes open the front door

INT SHELLY’S HOUSE - NIGHT 11

They step into the dark living room Shelly moves to flip on
a light but Dave stops her with a hand motion John hefts
the torch and touches his lighter to it A foot-tall FLAME
erupts from the head and they slowly creep through the dark
house by its flickering light

Breakdown Services - Castina -— Partial Draft

JOHN
Where do you see him mostly

SHELLY
(nervously)
The basement And once I saw him in
the bathroom His hand it uh
came up through the toilet while I-

DAVE
Okay Just show us the basement
door

SHELLY

It’s in the kitchen but I-guys I
don’t wanna go down there

JOHN
It’s cool stay here We’ll go down
and scope it out

John and Dave clomp down the stairs torchlight pooling down
the stairwell

INT SHELLY’S BASEMENT - NIGHT 12

It’s a nice modern basement Washer and dryer one of those
waist-deep floor freezers a hot water heater making a soft
ticking sound

They

JOHN
Well he’s not here

DAVE
Big surprise

stand around for a moment John uses the torch to light

a cigarette

JOHN
She seems like a nice girl doesn’t
she You know she reminds me of
Amber Amy’s friend When she came
to my door for a second I actually
thought it was her By the way I
wanna thank you for comin’ along
Dave sort of being my wingman on
this I’m not saying I’m going to
take advantage of her distress or
anything but

Dave ruefully shakes his head then stops He has tuned John
out Something is off here Dave turns to the large floor
FREEZER He moves over and opens the lid

Breakdown Services - Castina -— Partial Draft
DAVE
Oh geez

It is a TONGUE rubbery and purplish and
is longer animal-like twisted inside a
coated in frost And it isn’t alone the
with HUNKS OF FLESH some in clear bags
in pink-stained butcher paper

JOHN

not quite human It
Ziplock bag and
freezer is filled
some bigger chunks

Well I think it’s obvious Those
stories of UFO’s that go around
mutilating cows I think we just

solved it my friend

DAVE
(sighs )
It’s a deer you jackass Her

boyfriend hunts apparently That’s

what hunters do they keep the

meat

Dave nudges around and finds other painfully normal freezer
stuff underneath including a FROZEN TURKEY some SAUSAGES
Dave suddenly drops the lid turns and stares at John

DAVE (CONTD)
John did I hear you say you
thought she looked like Amber

JOHN
Yeah

DAVE

John Amber’s almost as tall as me
just under six feet Blonde hair

kind of top-heavy

JOHN
Yeah cute as hell I mean-

DAVE

And you think Shelly looks like
her The girl sitting upstairs

JOHN
Yeah

John turns to face Dave already getting

DAVE

John Shelly is short Short with

dark hair Blue eyes

Breakdown Services - Castina -— Partial Draft

JOHN
God Dammit I knew she was too good
to be true

They turn to the stairs and freeze Shelly is suddenly
there behind them sitting halfway up the stairs--looking
innocent playing the part wary eyes reflecting torchlight

DAVE
So ShellyJohn and I are having a
problem here We’re both seeing
completely different versions of
you

As Dave speaks his hand casually drifts toward the gun in
his pocket

DAVE (CONTD)

Now John has eyesight problems
because of his constant
masturbation but I don’t think-

HELLY BURSTS INTO SNAKES That’s right One second she’s a
irl then the next her body spills out of itself falling
nto a dark writhing puddle on the ground It’s a tangle of
ong black serpents rolling over each other and down the
teps Dave and John leap out of the way as the snakes
lither off into the darkness They get their bearings and
ave strides up the stairs toward the exit door -- reaches
or the knob

MONHAEE-QAMN

At that instant the DOORKNOB begins to melt and transform
turning pink and finally taking the shape of a FLACCID PENIS
It flops softly against the door as if a man was cramming it
through the knob hole from the other side Dave recoils and
looks back to John in horror

JOHN
That door cannot be opened

They stumble back down the stairs John jumping the last
five shoes smacking on the concrete The snakes flee from
the firelight and disappear under shelves and between
cardboard boxes

JOHN (CONT’D)
They love to play games don’t
they

DAVE
It’s all they have time for

John stops cold Dave looks at what he’s seeing

Breakdown Services - Castina -— Partial Draft

Meat Dozens of the wrapped and now partially-unwrapped hunks
from the freezer lay neatly on the floor in an almost
ceremonial fashion the objects arranged in the rough shape
of a man John moves the torch toward the head area where he
finds a FROZEN TURKEY still in the Butterball wrapper Under
it wedged between turkey and torso is the disembodied deer
tongue FLAPPING AROUND on its own accord

JOHN
Hmmmm That’s different

They both jump back as the turkey the tongue and a slab of
ribs LEVITATE OFF THE FLOOR Suddenly the man-shaped
arrangement of meat becomes animated raising up on two arms
made of game hens and country bacon planting two hands with
sausage link fingers on the floor The thing stands upright
It’s about seven feet tall its turkey head swiveling side
to side to survey the room the tongue swaying uselessly
below

Without warning it flings out a CHAIN OF LINK SAUSAGES from
its “arm” and the sausage cord cinches tight around Dave’s
neck John’s shotgun is out of his holster in a flash he
cocks both barrels and draws down on the meatstrosity

MEAT MONSTER
You disappoint me All those times
we have dueled In the desert In
the city You thought you had
vanquished me in Venice You’1l
never defeat me Marconi I have
sealed this house with my powers
You cannot escape

Dave chokes unable to breathe as John looks up at the thing
with incredulity

JOHN
Marconi As in Doctor Albert
Marconi The guy who hosts Magical
Mysteries on the Discovery Channel

John steps up combatively and glares at the thing

JOHN (CONTD)
You dumbass Marconi is fifty years
old He has white hair Dave and I
aren’t that old combined We’re not
your nemesis Your nemesis is
probably off giving some seminar
standing waist-deep in a pile of
his own money

The thing turns its turkey at John releasing Dave

Breakdown Services - Castina -— Partial Draft

JOHN (CONTD)
OK Tell ya what if we can get you
in touch with Marconi so you two
can work out your little
differences will you release us

MEAT MONSTER
You lie

DAVE
(catching his breath)

No we know him We’re in the same
business we have a direct line
Now we can’t get him down here
but surely a being as superhumanly
powerful as you can destroy him at
a distance right Here

The thing watches Dave fish out his cell phone and dial

INT CONVENTION HALL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 13

The camera follows behind a MYSTERIOUS MAN in a slick black
Armani suit and two hot FEMALE ASSISTANTS clad in black
leather as they stride down a backstage corridor A cell
phone beeps and one of the assistants answers it Behind the
assistant we can see into the dark convention hall Visible
inside is a LARGE SCREEN which illuminates a rapt AUDIENCE
On the screen a VIDEO begins to play It’s the same cosmic
imagery and “new-age” music from the infomercial we saw
earlier The deep-voiced narrator intones solemnly

INTRO VIDEO NARRATOR
He’s a seeker of truth in an age
of fear Unafraid of unseen forces
swirling around us Willing to face
down the legions of evil and
helping his fellow man to find a
path from darkness into the light
From sold out engagements in Rome
Tel Aviv Madison Square Garden and
Las Vegas

FEMALE ASSISTANT
Sir

She holds out the cell phone and the man takes it

Dave offers up the phone to Meaty

DAVE (CONTD)
Do we have a deal

The meat monster hesitates then finally nods its turkey up
and down Dave hands it the phone

MEAT MONSTER

So We meat again Marconi You

thought you had vanquished me but

T-
The beast SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUSTS into a ball of unholy blue
light With a shriek it leaves our world The lifeless cuts
of meat slap to the floor piece by piece the cell phone
clattering next to the pile John and Dave stare in silence

JOHN
Damn he’s good
INT CONVENTION HALL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 15
Dr Albert Marconi snaps the cell phone shut and hands it to
his assistant Concurrently inside the convention hall his
dramatic entrance music swells and as the audience bursts
into applause Marconi strides inside

EXT THEY CHINA FOOD - NIGHT 17

Breakdown Services - Castina -— Partial Draft

The camera glides down Main Street and moves in toward a
small storefront window in which a sign reads They China
Food

INT THEY CHINA FOOD RESTAURANT - EVENING 18

The camera zeros in on David Wong sitting alone at a window
booth of a small run-down Chinese restaurant

DAVE VO
My name is David Wong I once saw a
mans kidney grow tentacles tear
itself out of a ragged hole in his
back and go slapping across my
kitchen floor but thats another
story

David stares blankly out of the window occasionally glancing
across the street at the credit union CLOCK SIGN that flashes
532 PM Dave compares the time with his watch

In a doorway across the street Dave notices something A DARK
SHAPE emerges from an alcove It has the outline of a man
but is pitch black This is a Shadow Man Dave watches as the
thing floats up like a plume of smoke and slips soundlessly
off into the night

Dave starts to get up but sweating and overwhelmed by a
dizzy spell falls back into the booth He looks down at his
trembling hand

DAVE VO (CONTD)
More side effects Its always like
this when Im on the Sauce I dosed
six hours ago

Dave takes slow deep breaths trying to chill out He turns
to watch a small ASIAN WAITRESS deliver a PLATE of chicken-
fried rice to a bearded GUY on the other side of the room
Dave squints intently at the rice plate

DAVE VO (CONTD)
My count had 5829 grains of rice
on her plate The rice was grown in
Arkansas The guy who ran the John
Deere harvester was nicknamed
Cooter Im not a genius Im not
psychic either Just side effects
thats all

Dave gets the shakes again wills himself to stop and begins
unwrapping the napkin off the flatware set in front of him
Close on the FORK as Dave clutches it

Breakdown Services - Castina -— Partial Draft

DAVE VO (CONTD)
This fork was manufactured in
Pennsylvania six years ago on a
Thursday A guy once used it to
scrape a dog turd from his shoe

Dave drops the fork and takes a deep breath and closes his
eyes He opens them and jerks back in shock A MAN is now
sitting across from him in the booth

ARNIE
David Wong Did you doze off
there

DAVE

Hey uhyou’re Arnie right
He nods and shakes Dave’s hand

ARNIE
Sorry Im late

ARNIE BLONDESTONE is in is late forties uneven haircut and a
bad mustache He wears a shabby gray suit and tie with a fat
Windsor knot There is an awkward moment as Arnie stares at
Dave noticing the pale skin and beads of sweat on his
forehead

ARNIE (CONTD)
You dont look Asian Mr Wong

DAVE
Im not I was born right here Had
my last name changed Thought it
would make me harder to find You
know Wong is the most common
surname in the world

Arnie gets right to it and produces a little NOTEBOOK

ARNIE

DAVE
I was adopted Never knew my real
dad You could be my dad for all
I know Are you my dad

Arnie shifts in his seat

ARNIE
Eh I dont think so

addicted cannibal dabbled in
vampirism and necromancy Blew her

favors now and then but theres
always a catch with the Devil
Always a catch

Arnie looks up from his note-taking

ARNIE

bad because she wouldn’t let me
watch Space Ghost Are you pulling
my leg

DAVE
No This is what I do when Im
nervous She was bipolar thats
all Couldnt keep a house Isnt

You should use it

Arnie shoots Dave a practiced look of reporterly sincerity

ARNIE
I thought you wanted to get the
truth out your side of it If
not then why are we even here Mr
Wong

DAVE
Youre right Sorry

Arnie eyes Dave sizing him up He moves his gaze to the
other OBJECT on the table Dave rests his fingers on it It
is a small CANNISTER about the size and shape of a spool of
thread made of flat brushed metal

DAVE VO
I could blow your world away
Arnie If I show you what’s in
this container youd never sleep
another full night never feel at
one with the human race until the
day you died But were not ready
for that not yet

ARNIE

DAVE

ARNIE
You guys already got a little bit
of a following dont you I found
a couple of discussion boards on
the web devoted to you and your
friend yourhobby I guess So

spiritualists Exorcists
Something like that

The camera moves in on Dave’s eyes

DAVE VO
Okay enough farting around

DAVE
You have eighty-three cents in your
front pocket Arnie Three
quarters a nickel three pennies
The three pennies are dated 1983
1993 and 1999

Arnie grins the superior grin of the “Im the smartest man in
the room” skeptic then scoops his coins out of his pocket
He examines them confirms Dave is right Arnie gulps coughs
out a laugh

ARNIE
Well Ill be damned Thats a neat
trick Mr Wong

DAVE
If you flip the nickel ten times
youll get heads heads tails
heads tails tails tails heads
tails tails

ARNIE
Im not sure I wanna take the time
to-

DAVE

You were being chased through a
forest by your mother She was

knotted penises

Arnie croaks out a whisper

ARNIE

DAVE

The camera slowly moves into Dave’s face

DAVE VO
Bullshit What it gets is worse

Dave breathes deep and begins spinning his tale to Arnie who
grabs his pen and begins taking notes

DAVE
It started a couple years ago We
were just a year or two out of high
school Just kids So that friend

In the middle of a muddy field Dave stands watching the band

to say something like “Who would

the world”

EXT MUDDY FIELD BY PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT 20

Dave turns and wanders away As he passes a BEER KEG hanging
off the bed of a pickup truck Dave sees a friend FRED CHU
Fred is a little wiry young man with shoulder-length hair
and a goatee

DAVE
Hey Fred

Fred hands Dave a cup of beer Dave grabs it as Fred offers
up a toast

FRED

DAVE

A few yards behind them they can hear a GIRL(Amy) pleading
with an older TEENAGE BOY(Justin White) who wears a “Limp

AMY
Dammit Justin Please give it

JUSTIN

Back at the keg Dave brings the beer to his lips and THWACK
An object slams into his drink his cup is knocked out of his
hand and beer sprays everywhere Dave looks up to see Justin
and his TEENAGE FRIENDS laughing at him Dave flips Justin
the bird and then looks down at the truck bed and in the
center of a pool of beer lies a PROSTHETIC HAND soaked in
brew Dave gingerly picks up the plastic hand and examines
it

AMY
Could I have that back

Dave looks up to find Amy standing beside him face flushed
eyes brimming with tears She’s about 19 long reddish hair

DAVE
I bet this comes in handy

Dave gives the prosthesis back to the unsmiling Amy She

gulps and as inconspicuously as possible slides the
prosthetic over the stump on her left forearm

and drives away Alone Dave turns and walks over to where
his Bronco is parked

At the Bronco Dave is surprised to find a YELLOW LABRADOR
DOG sniffing at his door Dave looks back to the van but
it’s gone He shrugs unlocks the door and without an
invitation the dog leaps into the passenger seat

DAVE
Help yourself

Dave reaches over and grabs the dog’s tag which reads I’m

out a yelp of pain and yanks his hand back out of his pocket
He looks at his hand

CLOSE ON the palm of Dave’s hand etched into the skin is
the phrase YOU OWE ME ONE BEER

Dave sits there in the dark staring at his hand in horror
as Molly barks at his hand He suddenly jerks open the door
leans out and retches in the weeds Dave spits and opens his

It’s the CENTIPEDE

John again his expression telling him that he saw nothing

John points to the corner near the ceiling Very slowly
Dave turns and craning his neck follows John’s pointed
finger to the spot on the wall he so desperately needs Dave
to see Still nothing He turns back to John and now
revealed to us floating just above Dave’s head is

A HIDEOUS CREATURE that seems to be assembled from spare
parts It has a barbed tail like a scorpion seven dangling
legs each ending in a pink infantile hand Its lizard-like
head has a bank of a dozen mismatched eyes over a sharp
black beak

Dave does not see the creature

DAVE
John you can either come with me
to the hospital or I’m calling an
ambulance But what I’m not going
to do is-

Johns keys then pokes around some more and finds his jacket

pain Something has jabbed his finger

Close on finger as a DOT OF BLOOD wells to the surface of the

from the darkness behind Dave a very cold and very BONY
HAND reaches up and closes around his mouth Before Dave can
react SOMETHING long and cold and wet and twitching slides
across his neck and down his shirt Dave cranks the wheel and
claws at the hand

The Bronco skids across the road The thing on his neck
continues to writhe -- it’s the texture of a slug or a leech
but with a long tail Dave screams The Bronco blows through
an intersection blinking yellow lights he stomps on the
brake and it goes into a powerslide the rear of the truck
trading places with the front

VOICE (ROGER NORTH)

bite if you keep driving

Dave stomps the brake and the car skids to a stop He screams
and grabs at the monster on his chest Another hand reaches
around and snatches his wrist with a quick clean move

pistol The creature bites Dave gasps and his limbs stop in
protest A hand reaches up from the back seat and very slowly
takes the Smith from his hand

VOICE (ROGER NORTH) (CONTD)
Drive Just drive

The pain relents Dave gasps and eases his foot onto the
accelerator He tries to look down at the thing that has him
its tail sticking out of the neck of his shirt It has inch-
long STALKS all along its back each ending in what looks
like a SMALL BLACK EYE Several of the stalks tickle his chin
as it worms its way around the end of the creature resting
over his shoulder squirming gently back and forth on the
leather of his jacket

to you What’s happening tonight

Dave reaches up and adjusts the REARVIEW MIRROR to see in the
back seat He sees a MAN thin in his thirties brown hair
buggy eyes and a beak-like nose He speaks robotically with
difficulty He is wearing a white furry woman’s hat what
looks like a blue Wal-Mart vest with a little plastic toy
SHERIFFS BADGE tacked to the breast

with detached curiosity

from or who sent you

ROGER NORTH
I’m from right here so far as you

little My interest is only in you
and in your desperation not to
answer my question It is said out
of genuine concern for your
safety the very important role

The slug-creature on Dave’s chest begins pulsing gently
making gulping twitches Dave very slowly and non-
threateningly reaches out and adjusts the heat then casually
punches in the CIGARETTE LIGHTER In the rearview mirror he
sees North with a very grave expression staring out the
window as shadows and street lights flicker across his face

ROGER NORTH (CONT’D)
Fascinating

DAVE
What

Dave glances down at the lighter The slug on his chest
slowly curls its tail around coming to rest along his neck
and earlobe

ROGER NORTH
They harvest insects here do they
not For their honey Do the bees
know they make the honey for you
Or do they work tirelessly because
they think it is their own choice
Have you never noticed that after
hearing a new word for the first
time in your life you’ll hear it
again within twenty-four hours Do
you ever wonder why sometimes
youll see a single shoe lying
along the road

A single tear rolls down North’s cheek The lighter clicks

Dave yanks the lighter free the COILS ORANGE with heat Dave
slams on the brakes and racks the steering wheel He jams the
lighter onto the lump in his shirt where he estimates the
creature’s head will be

The truck spins and tilts up on two tires for a sickening
moment just as the slug thing shrieks and thrashes wildly
inside his shirt The truck falls back down on four wheels
with a thud

INT BRONCO STOPPED BY ROAD - NIGHT 35

A small yellow flame dances around a hole in Dave’s shirt
Dave grabs around for the slug thing and wrestles it free
Dave holds up the creature and sees its CIRCLE OF TINY TEETH
each curled and needle-sharp A thin straw-like APPENDAGE
emerges from the center about as long as a finger and whips
around flecking little droplets of blood Dave opens the
driver’s side door and flings the flopping thing out into the
middle of the street

Dave spins around in his seat and sees North pawing around
the floorboard for the gun Dave throws a wild punch at
North’s face misses Dave grabs the pistol off the floor
gets the drop on him and jams the barrel under North’s chin
They sit like that for a long moment both breathing out
puffs of steam

DAVE
Okay okay This thing I’ve got
pointed at you you know what it
does

Dave slowly takes the gun off North and crawls out the side
door and stands up into the wind He turns and looks around
the empty street and sees the squirming monster crawling to
the sidewalk Dave stalks over toward the creature lifts his
boot and stomps on it

Dave grunts random curses under his breath as he pounds the
thing again and again hammering with his boot heel The
SLUG EXPLODES in a spray of brown and red Dave keeps
stomping flecks of blood spraying with each impact until
the monster is a wet twisted stain

DAVE (CONTD)
“Things are in motion” huh

He kicks the shredded remains into a sewer grate nearby then
moves back toward the truck

The back door of the truck is open now and as he approaches
he sees that NORTH IS GONE Dave gets in slams the door and
reaches for the keys

Startled Dave practically jumps out of his skin and spins to
his left to find a BALD BLACK GUY in a suit standing at his
driver side of the car

DAVE
Uh yeah

The man flashes a BADGE

DETECTIVE

Detective Lawrence Appleton Please

INT POLICE STATION INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY 37

Dave is alone in the “interview” room at the Police Station
the one-way mirror is to his left In the reflection we see
Dave slumped in the chair disorganized black hair beard
stubble

The police detective steps in lays a thick MANILA FOLDER
loaded with photos on the table The detective sports a
goatee and shaved head A white COP follows him His white
partner has a crew cut with a mustache Almost a G Gordon
Liddy a cookie-cutter cop from central casting

DETECTIVE
I want to thank you for coming
down Mr Wong I bet it’s been
quite a night for you Been a long
night for me too as a matter of
fact

DAVE
Okay Where’s John

DETECTIVE
He’s fine He’s talking to another
officer just a few rooms from here

DAVE
John is talking Really

DETECTIVE

Don’t worry man Since you’re both
gonna tell the unvarnished truth
you don’t gotta worry about your
stories matching do you Just tell
me what you did last night

DAVE
Went to a party out by the lake I
came home just after midnight I
was asleep by two

DETECTIVE
You sure about that You sure you
didn’t go over to the One Ball Inn
down on Grand Avenue for a
nightcap Your buddies were all
there

DAVE VO
Well Officer I really only have
the one friend

DAVE

No I had work this morning I went
straight home

Breakdown Services - Castina -— Partial Draft

The camera moves in on Dave

DAVE VO
As I spoke a strange jittery
energy began to rise up in me
radiating from the chest out At
that moment things began to
clarify to become simple All of a
sudden I was startled to find I
could see the cop’s next question
coming before he spoke it word-for-
word “Have you heard the name”

DETECTIVE

Have you heard the name Nathan
Curry Guy your age parents own a
body shop here in town

DAVE
No

DAVE VO
How about Shelby Winder

DETECTIVE

How about Shelby Winder Heavy
girl senior at East Side High
Ring a bell

DAVE
No Sorry What happened

The camera moves into Dave’s darting beady eyes

DAVE VO

Everything was obvious now all the
walls of the maze turned to glass
I immediately knew two things this
list of people had all been at the
party last night and they were all
now dead or heading there Now how
do you know that How do you know
any of this Magic You know damn
well why That black shit John took
made blood contact with you Now
youre getting high partner On
the Soy Sauce It’s got you

DETECTIVE
We don’t know That’s why I got
four hours of overtime already
today At least nine people were at
the One Ball at closing time
twelve hours ago Three of them are
missing Your friend is here The
rest are dead

The detective pauses for effect

Breakdown Services - Castina -— Partial Draft

DETECTIVE (CONT’D)
Your friend is the only known
survivor of the “One Ball Nine” and
now don’t take offense at this but
he ain’t lookin’ too healthy right
about now Did he say anything this
morning

The white cop across the room puts his hands on his hips The
Detective keeps his gaze on Dave

DAVE
John called me last night talking
crazy Paranoia hallucinations
the whole “Monsters in his
apartment” bit Said he couldn’t
remember how he got where he was

like that
DETECTIVE

Did he say what he was on
DAVE

No
DETECTIVE

You know we can find out anyway
right We’re not interested in
booking a bunch of your raver
friends for poppin’ pills To
somebody like me the dead bodies
are what matters And if somebodys
sellin’ poison right now as we
talk-

DAVE
I’d tell you if I knew So what
that’s how everybody died
Overdose

The Detective says nothing and flips open the manila
envelope He fans out FOUR PHOTOGRAPHS One is a mug shot of
a young black guy Dreadlocks The others are a collage of
red He points to the mugshot

DETECTIVE
What about that guy You know him

DAVE

He was there Whatever John was on
this guy gave it to him John told
me

DETECTIVE

That’s Bruce Matthews Runs an
amateur unlicensed pharmaceuticals
operation on the corner of 30th and
Lexington

Dave nods toward the red photos The first picture is just
LUMPS on the floor on carpet a wet purplish black It
looks like somebody has tossed down a bucket of raw steaks
and chicken bones The next picture is a close-up of one
wall deep red splatters over half the surface area
occasional bits of meat stuck here and there

DAVE
And those

The detective points to the mug shot of the “Jamaican”

DETECTIVE
Before

He points to the red-drenched pictures

DETECTIVE (CONT’D)
After

Dave turns his eyes away suddenly sweating heavily as the
Detective stares him down

DAVE
What could even do that to a
person A bomb Some kind of-

DETECTIVE
Nothing you know how to do I’m
sure of that Maybe somethin’ not
uh not within our bounds of
familiarity What I need from you
is-

The door slams open and the detective’s words trail off as a
heavy-set COP rushes in and whispers in his ear The
Detective’s eyebrows shoot up and the two of them quickly
exit the room Outside the door we can hear a commotion
hurried SHOUTS and feet shuffling on floor tile

The Detective storms back into the room eyes wide

DETECTIVE (CONTD)
Your friend is dead

We hear a soundCLICK A voice recorder clicking off

INT THEY CHINA FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT 38

Arnie grumbles an apology fishes out a NEW BATTERY and goes
about changing it Dave glances over at Arnie’s discarded
notebook notices that he has abandoned his note-taking just
after the words “Three-Arm Sally”

ARNIE
--got your cell phone bill did it
list the call you got at Denny’s

DAVE
What I’m sorry

ARNIE
The call you got from your friend
at Denny’s when your friend was
sitting there next to you without a
phone Was that call on your cell
phone bill

DAVE
Not that kind of service plan

Arnie scratches his head knits a question with his eyebrows

ARNIE
So the black stuff this “Soy
Sauce” it’s a drug right

DAVE
Well I’1l get to that

ARNIE
And it makes you smarter When you
take it it lets you read minds and
all that

DAVE
Not really It heightens your
senses I think I don’t know When
youre on it it’s like overload
like if you hooked your car radio
up to one of those interplanetary
SETI antennas You get shit from
all over the place can see things
you shouldn’t be able to but I
don’t think it would help you do
your taxes

ARNIE
And you still got some of this
stuff

Arnie glances furtively down at the silver cannister

DAVE
I’m getting to that

ARNIE
You’re on it right now That’s how
you did the thing with the uh
with the coins and the dream and
all that earlier

DAVE
Yeah I took some today It
fading though

ARNIE
So the effects don’t last that
long

DAVE
The side effects don’t last that
long The effects will last the

rest of my life I think
Close on Dave

DAVE VO
Maybe longer

Arnie scratches his forehead

ARNIE
So the kids that died this is
that rave overdose right I
remember all that a couple years
ago seein’ it in the news They
thought they had gotten ahold of
some tainted Ecstasy or somethin’
like that So you were the guy
that--

DAVE
--something like that

ARNIE
And if I contact this Detective
Appleton he’1ll remember talking to
you

DAVE
Good luck finding him

Arnie scribbles some notes then pauses

DAVE (CONTD)
So What do you think

ARNIE
I think you’ve probably got a book
here if you flesh it out a little
DAVE
A book Meaning a work of fiction
Meaning it’s all bullshit

Arnie shrugs

Breakdown Services - Castina -— Partial Draft

ARNIE
A story is a story I’m just a
feature reporter so the fact that
you think it happened is my story
You know I don’t remember leaving
the house with any change in my
pocket You could have slipped
those coins to me

DAVE
Without you feeling it And the
thing with your dream Come on
Arnie

DAVE VO
Gotta love the skeptic mon

ARNIE
I think you’re trying to be one of
those mentalists like that Dr
Albert Marconi on TV

DAVE
Dr Marconi may be theatricalbut
believe me he’s not an act

ARNIE
Well I saw Marconi’s show in Vegas
and your story seems to be a lot of
the same kind of hocus pocus to me
And you know one time I saw this
other guy a sleight-of-hand artist
who aS part of his show would
call somebody out of the audience
and steal the glasses right off
their face No kidding He’d send
the poor sap back to their seat and
they’d be squinting around tryin’
to figure out why they couldn’t see
all of a sudden

Arnie looks Dave directly in the eye

ARNIE (CONTD)

There’s no magic Mr Wong Just
knowing tricks the other guy
doesn’t know about I can make
myself invisible just by standin’
behind ya

Dave stands up

DAVE
Come with me I wanna show you
somethin’

ARNIE

Where are we going

Breakdown Services - Castina -— Partial Draft

DAVE
Just out to my truck
Dave gets up and moves to the door They make their way out
to Dave’s Bronco in the parking lot
EXT THEY CHINA FOOD PARKING LOT - NIGHT 39

Dave approaches the rear and drops the tailgate revealing a

white sheet covering a LARGE BOX the size of one of those

plastic portable dog carriers

DAVE
What’s the weirdest thing
ever seen Arnie

youve

Arnie grins looking over the box Like a damn kid at

Christmas

ARNIE
Well one time I was down
basement and there’s just
light bulb and out of the
my eye you know it sort
like my shadow back there
movin’ without me It was
a second and like I said

in my

a bare
corner of
of looked
was

just for
it was

just one of those tricks of light
you get out the corner of your eye
But I tell ya I didn’t go back
down there until it was broad
daylight out

DAVE
I need you to get in that mindset
Arnie We’re out here in public
with lights on and the whole
world’s solid and lined up real
neat But down in that basement in
the dark alone you believed in
things Dark things I need you to
open yourself up like that Okay
Ready

Arnie nods and Dave throws back the sheet Long pause

DAVE (CONT’D)
Do you see it

ARNIE
No Or you know it’s an empty
cage

DAVE
Turn your head so you’re looking
at me

DAVE (CONTD)
You should see the box out the
corner of your eye just like the
shadow in the basement

ARNIE
Okay

Arnie’s grin is fading He is losing patience fast

DAVE
You ever go in the bathroom at
night Arnie and for a second you
glimpse something in the mirror
other than your reflection

ARNIE
Let’s go back inside okay Your
story was more interesting

Dave grabs Arnie by the lapels of his coat and gets in his
face

DAVE
Youre going to die Arnie Some
day you will face that moment And
at that moment either you will face
complete non-existence or you will
face something even stranger

Arnie’s face stiffens as Dave’s words sink in

DAVE (CONTD)

On an actual day in the future you
will be in the unimaginable Arnie
It is physically impossible to
avoid it Think about that right
now Set your mind on it

Silence for a few seconds Arnie nods a little takes a deep
breath

ARNIE
Okay

DAVE
Now without turning your head
look at the box

Arnie does and instantly recoils yelps stumbles and finally
falls on his ass

ARNIE
(gasps) —
Oh shit Shit What the shit is
that Sh-shit Shit

Dave throws the sheet back over the box closes up the
Bronco Arnie scrambles to his feet and quickly backs up
pointing at the Bronco

ARNIE (CONTD)
How did you do that And what the
fuck was that thing What the fuck

DAVE
There’s no name for it in this
world Pretty freaky isn’t it

ARNIE
You-you made me see something
Something out of my own head You
freaked me out so I would see
something

DAVE
No it’s really there I’m
surprised you saw it so easy You
must have an open mind Most people
don’t see it that fast unless
they’re stoned or drunk

Arnie keeps stepping back muttering

DAVE (CONTD)
I want to tell the rest of the
story Arnie I need to I need to
get it out But you need to take it
for what it is The truth Are you
ready to do that

Arnie looks at Dave with uncertainty then nods
ARNIE
Okay Until I figure it out for

DAVE
Eh that’ll have to do Come on

Arnie takes a deep breath as Dave leads him back toward the
restaurant (Breakdown Services - Casting - Partial Draft)

DAVE (CONTD)
Anyway so the cop comes in and
tells me John is dead
INT POLICE STATION INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY 40

Dave is out of his chair and halfway to the door

DAVE
“Wha-how”

Breakdown Services - Castina -— Partial Draft

The cop stops him cold with a stiff-arm to the chest

DETECTIVE
Now calm down He went into a
convulsion or somethin’ and his
pulse stopped but-now listen to me
here-we got ambulances they’1ll be
here in thirty seconds We got
Vinny doin’ CPR on him Vinny’s a
lifeguard in his off hours That
boy’s in the hands of people who
know what they’re doin’

Dave knocks the hand away from his chest The white cop drops
his arms and steps toward them The Detective’s lips peel
back slightly to reveal gritted teeth

DETECTIVE (CONTD)

Here’s what you’re gonna do son
youre gonna wait here Ill be
back in five minutes and you are
gonna start telling me the truth I
am gonna get to the bottom of this
case and if you obstruct me you
will live the rest of your days
wishing you had not

The Detective turns and exits the room Dave stands there
lost listening to the confusion of SHOUTS and controlled
panic outside The SIREN of an ambulance can be heard A tear
rolls down his cheek

Dave’s cell phone chirps Dave looks toward Officer Liddy

now standing placidly in the middle of the room blocking his
ath to the door He gestures toward his pocket as if to ask
if he minds The cop says nothing Dave answers the phone

DAVE
Yeah

JOHN
Dave This is John

DAVE
What Did you get out

JOHN
Yes and no Are you still at the
police station

DAVE
Um yeah I-everybody ran out of

Also is there any way you can

I can’t leave

Dave lowers his voice to a whisper

DAVE (CONT’D)
There’s a guy still in here with
me another cop

JOHN
No there’s not Check the mirror

Dave hangs there in utter confusion for a few seconds then
looks to his left In the mirror Dave is standing there
talking on his cell COMPLETELY ALONE Dave looks directly at
the cop then in the mirror back to the cop The cop
suddenly moves in his direction

DAVE
I don’t get it

JOHN
He’s not real Dave Not in the
uh traditional sense

DAVE

(backing up)
He’s coming toward me

Breakdown Services - Castina -— Partial Draft

JOHN
Just go Just walk out You’re
gonna start seeing things like this
from time to time It’s important
that you not freak out

The cop is just one step away now His mustache twitches as
if he is starting to grin underneath it

DAVE
So he uh can’t hurt me

JOHN
Oh I’m pretty sure he can

A hand darts out and clenches Dave’s face The cop’s fingers
dig into Dave’s cheeks squeezing He shoves Dave back and
slams him hard against the wall Dave claws at the cop’s arm
then hauls off and smacks him across the nose with his cell
phone

The cop keeps his grip on Dave and jerks him in close Face-
to-face Dave notices the COP’S MUSTACHE TWITCHES again as if
this amuses him greatly To Dave’s horror the mustache keeps
twitching and then one end of it begins to CURL UP AND PEEL
OFF Finally the MUSTACHE DETACHES completely leaving a
patch of PINK SHREDDED SKIN

The MUSTACHE THING flaps its halves like bat wings- flies
over and lands right on Dave’s face G Gordon Liddy’s
mustache bites Dave above the right eyebrow

Dave howls and slaps at the thing with his left hand then
with all his strength shoves a knee into the detective’s
guts just below the ribs

The mustache bat flitters over to Dave’s ear and clamps down
Dave yelps and slaps at it again The cop still has hold of
Dave by the neck so Dave lifts his knee and puts his boot on
the guy’s neck With all his strength Dave kicks down and
yanks at the same time when suddenly to his amazement

THE COP’S ARM TEARS OFF AT THE SHOULDER
The cop has a six-inch BLOODY HOLE on one shoulder now

The DETACHED ARM on its own suddenly WHIPS around Dave’s
neck and coils around it like a python No hint of bone in
there now The arm makes two muscular loops around until the
ragged stump hangs under his chin like a meat scarf

Dave thrashes around tries to pry the thing off The
armsnake is all muscle tensed and wiry slowly constricting
off his windpipe The mustache bat flits around Dave’s head
taking stinging little bites here and there

Relentlessly the cop stands up from the floor reaches for
Dave with his remaining arm Dave opens the door and flings
himself out of the room-

INT POLICE STATION HALLWAY - DAY 41

-and it is over The thick bundle of armsnake has vanished
from Dave’s neck as has the flying mustache

Dave stands up shakily sees four GUYS hustling down the hall
with an EMPTY STRETCHER Dave sticks his finger in his mouth
it comes out BLOODY His cell phone is still in his hand but
cracked with a busted mouthpiece from its tour as a nose
club

As people rush past him Dave gets it together and strolls
back through the police station finally walking right out
the front door

EXT SIDEWALK - DAY 42

Dave walks heart pounding A FAT MAN in a shiny business
suit strides by and time begins to DISTORT as Dave looks at
him

DAVE VO
I realized that this man would die
in just two weeks a heart attack
while trying to knock his cat out
of a tree with a broomstick

Time still distorted Dave watches a 1998 Trans-Am gleam past
in the street with two YOUNG MEN driving

DAVE VO (CONTD)
I could tell from the posture of
the driver that the car was stolen
and that its owner was dead The
fan belt would break in 26931
miles

Dave rubs his temple

DAVE
Man I gotta focus on one thing at
a time or my brain’s gonna melt and
run out of my ears like strawberry
jam

Dave takes a deep breath and time comes back to normal He is

startled as is cell phone rings He puts the broken thing to
his ear

Dave walks a dozen steps and sees a CART with a yellow and
orange UMBRELLA hanging over it The HOT DOG GUY is painfully
thin looks about a hundred and sixty years old

DAVE
Okay

JOHN
Buy a bratwurst from him

Dave steps up and buys a brat wrapped in a hot dog bun with a
sheet of wax paper for 315 Dave continues walking along
the sidewalk toward the park

DAVE
Okay I have the bratwurst
JOHN
Put it up to your head
Pause
DAVE
I’m going to have to ask you why

JOHN

I have to show you something

Dave shrugs glances around and trying to be as
inconspicuous as possible lays the sausage against his ear

JOHN
Dave Can you hear me

Johns voice comes clear as day through the tube of seasoned
meat Dave glances down at the cell phone and gets the point
The cell phone display is black the GLASS BUSTED out of it
A green circuit board is poking out of one side

DAVE
All right all right I’m hearing
you through some kind of psychic
vibration or whatever and not the

just told me that

JOHN
I can’t get you through the cell
any more You have to talk through
the bratwurst from now on Sorry

Dave rubs his eyes exhausted

JOHN (CONTD)
The only reason you can hear me is
because you got some of the Soy
Sauce into your system from the
syringe But it’s not very much and
it wont last long

DAVE
What is that stuff John The

JOHN
Listen You gotta get over to

cops there now but there will be
We have sort of a narrow window
here Take a cab to Wally’s and get

Dead The voice is gone the static is gone Up ahead one
TRAILER stands out YELLOW POLICE TAPE all around it

INT ROBERT MARLEY’S TRAILER - DAY 45

Dave is in the doorway as the trailer door swings open He
cautiously enters The blood and guts have been cleaned up
The carpet is still discolored and the walls are forever
stained a faded reddish-brown There is a sofa and a chair
pocked with cigarette burns Dave glances into the open
kitchenette then turns and walks to the other end He
reaches the bedroom and pushes open the door

It’s dark and empty All the windows are covered with foil
Against the wall is a TELEVISION and what looks like yard
compost with something like twigs sticking out Dave is
startled to see the TV click on

ONSCREEN - Staticand then a shot of the interior of the
empty trailer Dave looks closely at it Suddenly a FIGURE
appears walking into the trailer living room Dave looks
intently and suddenly realizes the figure is HIMSELF

Dave investigates the back of the TV looking for a tape or
DVD player He finds the power cord but it’s just hanging off
the ground - THE TV IS NOT PLUGGED IN

As Dave pokes around the back of the TV we can see the
screen go to static and the bizarre image of the “Static Man”
watching him appears Oblivious Dave notices that the back
panel of the TV has been removed and a strip of what looks
like RED SEAWEED leads out of it and into a large DEAD FISH
The gut of the fish has been slit open and bulging out of it
is a pink WET MASS Close to it is an AQUARIUM TANK filled
with a thick yellowish substance and at the bottom is a
wrinkled GRAYISH MASS that could be a human brain or possibly
a meatloaf It is all connected everything in the pile by
tendons and tissue It’s some kind of MEAT MACHINE

ON TV SCREEN 45A

As Dave looks back at the TV screen the image is back to a
shot of the living room again only now onscreen Dave is ina
conversation with another figure who SUDDENLY DRAWS A GUN AND
SHOOTS ONSCREEN DAVE Onscreen Dave slumps to the ground

Dave is stunned watching these events unfold when
suddenlyThump A faint sound from the other end of the
trailer Dave steps into the hall Nothing THUMP A heavy
sound violent Dave moves toward the kitchen He looks
around the counter floor and appliances Nothing Dead
silence

Dave gently reaches for a kitchen KNIFE on the butcher’s
block when- THUMP The refrigerator THUMP No The freezer
section at the top The little door up there rattles with the
sound like it was bumped- THUMP

With one last thump the freezer door flies open A round
frosty LUMP the size of a coffee can tumbles out of the
freezer falls to the floor and rolls to a stop in front of
Dave He suddenly bolts for the exit As Dave reaches for the
front door knob he glances out the window and sees

POV - OUT TRAILER WINDOW OF TRAILER PARK 45B

a SEDAN parked out there where none had been before
Plain white but too many antennas Cop car Somebody getting
out The Detective

Dave spins around searching for a back exit and sees a SLIM
DOOR leading out of the kitchen However it means stepping
over the possessed Jar which is now sitting on the linoleum
steaming faintly rocking back and forth Dave can now see
that the thing is a bundle of duct tape something wrapped in
frosty layer after layer of the stuff

A look back outside His cop friend is surveying the exterior
of the trailer Dave drops to the floor

Pock A hollow snapping sound from the freezer Jar The
thing hops an inch off the floor and so does Dave when he
hears the sound It does it again jumps higher Something
trying to punch its way out from inside- Snap Ka-chunk
POCK POCK POCK There is a bulge now on the side of the
container strands of duct tape fibers popping out in the
center Fear keeps Dave’s ass velcroed to the carpet The Jar
convulses and

FOONT The Jar erupts ejaculates gives birth in a cloud of
stringy tape bits A shotgun-hole blows out from the guts of
the can and a little blur of an object zips out and bounces
off the paneled wall above Dave This offspring falls to the
carpet bounces and lands next to his shoe A little shiny
METAL CANISTER the size of a pill bottle Not moving or
growling or glowing Just sitting Waiting

Dave looks at the little metal vial Dave raises his foot to
kick the vial away then reconsiders

DAVE VO
You know what’s in there right
Nope No idea You know Robert had
a stash of the shit and if he had
a stash he couldn’t just cram it
under his bed That black shit
moves It has a will an attitude
It bites And then I realized all
at once what I had come here for

little hit in my thigh I could
communicate with the dead with

then Just like that

Dave picks up the bottle it’s cold as an ice cube He finds
a seam and twists the top half off Out tumble two tiny COLD
PEBBLES Perfect and black in his palm like two coal-
flavored Tic-Tacs

DAVE VO (CONTD)

hand and then-SEES THEM MOVE wriggling in his hand like a
couple of fat black maggots Dave flings them to the carpet
He stumbles to his feet

- the things twist change grow tiny little black LIMBS Two
flat appendages grow out of one of them begin to twitch
move flap A blur now Wings The thing makes a terrible
insectile fluttering sound against the carpet Then the Tic-
Tac launches itself at Dave a faint dark streak Dave
doesn’t realize his mouth is hanging open until WHAP In
an instant the thing has shot into his mouth Dave coughs
hacks convulses and swallows

Dave opens his eyes looks desperately for the other one
Hard to spot on the dark carpet- There It buzzes it flies
So fast it vanishes from sight Dave clamps his lips shut
slaps his hand over his mouth for good measure The thing
lands on his left cheek and Dave swats it with his free hand
He suppresses a scream brings his hand away from his face
and finds it bloody

DAVE VO

OH SON OF A MOTHERFUCK THE FUCKING
SOY SAUCE IS DIGGING A FUCKING HOLE
INTO MY FUCKING FACE

Dave falls flat on the floor thrashing and rolling like a
seizure His face and shirt are wet and sticky with blood

I’1ll throw myself at the cop and
beg him to take me to the emergency

FLAME ON THE PRODUCTION FLOOR” with a cartoon explosion
underneath it Dave steps forward toward the man

POV we see that Dave is NOT THERE just a phantasm The man
shrugs and turns back to his monitor

INT ROBERT MARLEY’S TRAILER - DAY 48

And in a blink Dave is back in the trailer on the floor He
breathes a sigh of relief as

The cop steps through the door and stops cold at the sight of
Dave Dave climbs awkwardly to his feet with his hand on his
bloody face Dave notices the man holds two red plastic
GASOLINE CANS The Detective sets the gas cans at his feet
lights a cigarette and smokes in silence

DAVE
So I suppose you’re wondering why
I’m here

He shakes his head slightly

DETECTIVE
Same as everybody You’re trying to
figure out what in the name of
Elvis is going on Everybody ‘cept
me Me I don’t even wanna know no
more I bet you’re wondering what
I’m doing with these here gas cans

He studies Dave’s bleeding face then reaches into his pocket
and hands him a handkerchief Dave presses it to his cheek

DAVE
Thank you I uh fell On
adrill

The Detective picks up a gas can unscrews the cap and
starts splashing the orange liquid around the living room
Dave watches then takes a tentative step toward the door In
a blur the Detective whips his hand out of his jacket and
suddenly there is a REVOLVER aimed right at Dave’s face

DETECTIVE
You leavin’ already

Dave puts his hands up in surrender and the Detective nods
down toward the other gas can

Mr Wong High school kid

DAVE

He moves into the doorway and sees the BLOODY MESS and the
PINK PILE of what’s left of the Rastafarian Drug Dealer
Wailing on the floor on his hands and knees is Justin
White

DETECTIVE VO
I thought he was stabbed in the gut
or somethin’ but I looked closer
and there was something on him All
over Justin his arms and his face

Justin appears to be covered in THICK WHITE HAIRS all over
him like little twisted bits of fishing line

Justin is screaming in agony Justin’s got his hands on the
floor and the hairs are crawling up his fingers and wrists
and up under his sleeves

And this stuff whatever it is
it’s movin’ it’s alive On one
side of the room I got a guy
sprayed all over the walls like he
stepped on a land mine and then
there’s this I notice real fast
that this swarm is oozing out from
the pile of dead guy next to us

The Detective turns and bolts out of the trailer

The Detective runs out to his car and frantically grabs a CAN
OF PEPPER SPRAY and then races back toward the trailer

tracks Justin is standing there perfectly fine - no sign of
any infestation He’s checking his hair in the mirror

Back to present - Dave stares at the Detective
DAVE
But you’re still gonna burn this
place down

That’s right

DAVE
And you’re not gonna let me go

The Detective is silent for a moment

DETECTIVE
So you understand my mood You
understand why I’m out committin’
felonies today There are dark
things happenin’ and I got the real
lonely feeling like I’m the only
one who knows the only one who can
do anything about it

The Detective moves toward the door blocking Dave’s exit He
sets the gas can down almost empty now and gestures to it

DETECTIVE (CONTD)
Pick it up and toss it out the
door in the yard

Dave hesitates and the detective puts his gun on him again
Dave does as he is asked The Detective pulls out his lighter
and flips the igniter Standing there a little yellow flame
flickering in his hand he says

DETECTIVE (CONT’D)
You know everybody’s got a ghost
story a UFO or a bigfoot story

The Detective gazes into the lighter flame as he speaks as
if mesmerized With a soft double-click his thumb pulls back
the HAMMER of the gun

DETECTIVE (CONT’D)
Now what I think is that stuff is
both real and not real at the same
time I ain’t no Star Trek fan and
I don’t know about other dimensions
and all that But I am an old
school Catholic and I do believe in
Hell I believe it ain’t just
rapists and murderers down there I
believe its demons and worms and
vile things the grease trap of
the universe And the more I think
of it the more I think it’s not
some place ‘down there’ at all
that it’s here all around us We
just don’t perceive it Just like
how the country music radio station
is out there in the air even if
you ain’t tuned to it But I think
somehow through some chemistry or
magic or some voodoo that Jamaican
S0OB tuned into it into Hell
itself With that he opened the
door He became the door

Dave nods opens his mouth then closes it again

DETECTIVE (CONTD)
And me I intend to close it

The Detective raises his gun takes point blank aim at Dave
and SHOOTS

feet per second Dave steps out of time and can see

INT FACTORY - NIGHT 54

--- A shot of a production line as THOUSANDS OF 38
CARTRIDGES are fabricated The camera pans by a sign which
reads Worthington Munitions We focus on a SINGLE CARTRIDGE
as it moves down the fabrication line It passes the massive
red sign we saw before which reads “NO SMOKING OR OPEN FLAME
ON THE PRODUCTION FLOOR” with a cartoon explosion underneath
it 4

Suddenly we see the SAME MAN IN THE SAME BLUE UNIFORM at the
same factory from earlier As previously Dave calls to the
man

DAVE VO
Uh hey

As the man turns to look for “phantom” Daveour cartridge
passes into the machine that adds its pinch of gunpowder and
a HOUSEFLY crawls into the casing a split-second before the
lead bullet is rammed into it

and sealed

INT POLICE STATION ROOM - DAY 55

--- At the Police Station the Detective opens the new ammo
box and slides the defective shell into his revolver slaps
the cylinder shut

We cut back to the slow motion bullet as it streaks across
the room and punches hard into Dave’s sternum Still in slow
motion the impact knocks Dave backward - but the defective
bullet unable to penetrate his sternum ricochets off the
bone bounces off the wall and tumbles to the floor by Dave

Black And then a FLUMPH sound like a lit gas grill Dave’s
eyes blink open How much time has passed

Dave feels a wet bloody patch right in the middle of his
shirt winces with the pain Dave coughs and rolls over on
his side

He fingers the hole in is shirt and realizes there is no hole
in his sternum Dave raises his head and sees the COUCH IS A
BONFIRE the entire living room in flames

Dave looks over and sees the TV The “STATIC MAN” PEERS OUT
of the tube watching him

Dave bolts crawling on hands and knees The smoke is filling
up the room fast He scrambles down the hall The place is
like an oven a blast furnace He crawls into the kitchen
looks back and sees the fire racing toward him He lowers his
head to the linoleum a few inches of fresh air down there

A low sound Wailing From outside Getting louder A car
coming A dog barking Get back Get back Who said that A
thunderous terrible sound Glass shattering metal
screaming wood snapping The kitchen explodes around him

Dave is flung backward and finds himself looking at the grill
of a car his car Ford Bronco symbol inches from his face
The car reverses itself and wrenches free of the wreckage
that had been the kitchen wall There is now a rupture
frayed with tufts of insulation and shredded aluminum siding
Dave flings himself out of the hole falls onto the cool
grass outside

EXT ROBERT MARLEY’S TRAILER - DAY 57

Dave coughs and starts to pass out the trailer a roiling
fireball behind him Dave hears a DOG BARK

VOICE

That voice again from nowhere Dave struggles to his feet
sees his Bronco sitting about twenty feet away and to his
amazement at the wheel is Molly the Dog Dave stares at
this for a good moment He staggers to his feet and stumbles
to the car gets in

checking his extremities for injuries

in the living room blocking his path is Justin White Their
eyes meet and Justin smiles

Justin opens his mouth and emits a RUMBLING SOUND like
something boiling up from his lungs He closes it again
gathers himself and says brightly

BRAIN MATTER Justin is thrown backwards Dave’s finger
squeezing the trigger as fast as it can twitch gunshots
shattering the air Bursts of blood flick out from Justin’s
chest and thighs and gut shots landing and backing him
across the room He stumbles and falls against a wall but
never goes down The gun clicks dry but Dave squeezes the
trigger about twenty more times just to be sure Justin
rights himself looks down at his wounds sighs like a man
who has dropped his pie in his lap

His words are cut off when the empty gun Dave hurls at him
smacks off his cheek knocking him backwards once more

Dave then quickly pushes himself back to his feet Dave takes
another swing at him misses-Justin punches Dave again In
the crotch Dave falls backward catches himself on a kitchen
chair then picks it up and swings it Dave cracks the chair
over Justin’s shoulder Justin shrugs it off and in a blur
throws three more rabbit punches that each landed solidly on
Dave’s balls Dave goes down and stays down

Darkness barking and footsteps Dave comes to consciousness
to find Molly’s wet nose in his face

Sitting on one stack is a very pale and shaky Amy scratched

curled up on the floor beside her Sitting across a row of
green Heineken cases is Fred Chu

The truck pulls through the entrance to the weed-choked
parking lot surrounding the looming ABANDONED SHOPPING MALL
The place has been empty for a decade Trash is strewn
everywhere a couple rusted-out car hulks are there Windows
are boarded up on the deteriorating brick structure as are
the front doors

As the truck pulls up to a stop John whispers

JOHN
Okay it’s go time You’re gonna
have to throw the bottles hard
really rear back and wing the

They take positions in a circle by the door each holding a

high-proof cocktail John with his lighter lights all the

The door slowly grinds open A band of pale moonlight appears
at the floor as the door slides upward Surprisingly Justin
looks mostly normal skin pale under the moonlight blonde
hair rustling in the stiff breeze

Only now both of HIS EYEBALLS ARE PROTRUDING about six inches
from his skull The pupils at the end of their new white and
pink stalks twist horribly in their direction staring at the
foursome for a very long and terrible moment

They are so caught off guard by this image that it kills the
momentum all of them frozen jaws hanging open expecting
the person next to them to make the first move

Amy breaks the paralysis by weakly tossing a flaming bottle
at JustinShitload The Justin monster watches as it misses
and bounces harmlessly to the ground rolling to a stop The
wick flickers and goes out Shitload curls his twin optical
skull-erections down and looks at the sad bottle draining its
contents into the dirt

JUSTIN
Put that shit down leave the dog
and come with me fools

They stand there a moment then comply Justin seeming to
realize his eyes are dangling from his skull in a series of
sickening jerky neck movements sucks them back in

EXT MALL OF THE DEAD ENTRANCE - NIGHT 64

Justin leads them across the dusty lot to the main mall
entrance One of the front doors is ajar Propped next to the
door is a FEDEX BOX which almost certainly was a delivery
mistake Justin pushes in through the door indifferently
kicking the box inside as he passes

INT MALL OF THE DEAD - NIGHT 65

Justin leads them through the dark concourse boarded up and
broken out mall shops on either side The floor is a mess of
trash and pools of water from the collapsing ceiling above
Justin turns and stops at a BLANK WALL

John catches Dave’s eye and as they both stare hard at the
wall they can see an ILLUSORY IMAGE OF A LARGE DECORATIVE

You know she gives me a feeling I
enjoy in my pants But if you give

of your sorry asses your
desperation to put off death
leadin’ to the ultimate death of
everybody and everything Dude I
can’t believe you ain’t all
paralyzed by the pure naked horror
of this place

There’s silence as they all take this in

JOHN
Uh thank you

John’s eyes never move as he speaks and suddenly Dave can
see a look there a confidence Dave follows his gaze back
toward the front doors and sees what John is seeing Dave
quickly looks away again

Suddenly there is a burst of movement shuffling feet and
shouts John makes his move on his feet running and then
diving He skids on the floor and seizes the white FedEx box

Shitload is on him fast Bruce Lee-fast He delivers a kick
to John’s gut that actually knocks him back a couple of feet
and wrenches the box from his arms Shitload looks baffled
moves to throw the box aside but stops cold He looks at the
label then at John then at Dave then at the label again

JUSTIN
What’s in here

John says nothing Shitload stiffens his arm toward John in a
‘Heil Hitler’ motion This confuses them for a second-before
a SLIT APPEARS in Justin’s palm and something like a MOUTH
puckers there A thin stream of thick yellow ACID drips onto
the floor gathering in a small smoking puddle that quickly
eats through the tile floor with a soft hiss

JUSTIN (CONTD)
Tell me

Dave looks at the label on the box The package is addressed
to “Care of John” to this mall on Highway 59

DAVE FLASHES BACK seeing the receipt for this package back
in John’s apartment

JUSTIN (CONTD)
Tell me or I’1ll melt your face
yo What is it like a bomb

JOHN
Why don’t you open it and we’1l
both find out

JUSTIN
Take it outside

JOHN
Okay

John bends over to pick it up

JUSTIN
Stop Leave it where it is

JOHN
Okay

Justin tears open the box roots around inside with his hand
and then pulls out a sheet of wrinkled NOTEBOOK PAPER Justin
examines the big ink pen letters which read

“JOHN LOOK OUTSIDE BY THE TRASH CAN NEAR THE FRONT DOORS”
Justin turns to John

JUSTIN
What’s out there A weapon You
tryin’ to gank me

John doesn’t answer Justin tosses aside the note and strides
out the front doors Through the doors they can indeed see a
TRASH CAN out there Justin walks out to it looks down
kicks around at the base of it with his feet He stands there
for a moment hands on his hips when suddenly a THUNDEROUS
BOOM echoes through the mall-

Justin is blown clear off his feet out onto the sidewalk A
mechanical ka-chunk of a pump shotgun is heard and a second
shot sounds then a third

Seen through the doorway a figure hurls a BUCKET OF LIQUID
onto Justin’s still moving corpse Suddenly Justin’s body
erupts in a BALL OF FLAME

From the darkness in steps the Detective loading shells
into a pistol-grip RIOT GUN He looks right at Dave training
the gun on him

DETECTIVE
I guess there’s no gettin’ rid of

DAVE
No I don’t think so

As they scramble to their feet John leans over and picks up
his FedEx box A PACK OF CIGARETTES and a LIGHTER slide out
into his hand He plucks one cigarette out lights it

INT DETECTIVE’S SUV - NIGHT 66

Thirty seconds later they are all piled into an SUV The
Detective and Dave in front John Amy and Fred are in the
back

DAVE
Those things you saw take over
Justin-they’re looking for hosts
okay Now there was a drug that the
guy the one who exploded was-

DETECTIVE
Stuff is black right

DAVE
Oh You’re uh familiar with it

DETECTIVE
Sounds like you and I both got long
stories to tell So anybody that
takes this stuff is a potential
host for those flying worm things

DAVE
Actually I dunno

The Detective rubs his eyes and jams the key into the
ignition

DETECTIVE
I’ve been up 48 hours straight and
this case ain’t gettin’ any
clearer

The Detective starts up the car and accelerates through the
deserted mall parking lot

DAVE
Me too Adrenaline keeps me goin’

Breakdown Services - Castina -— Partial Draft

DETECTIVE
Yeah That and those loud
piercing voices in my head

DAVE
What kind of-

The cop’s EYES EXPLODE He shrieks as TWO SPRAYS OF BLOOD
fleck over the windshield Amy screams John and Fred bellow
“OH FUCK” simultaneously

LITTLE WHITE RODS POUR DOWN the cop’s face swirl around
inside the SUV He lets go of the steering wheel Dave grabs
for it

EXT MALL OF THE DEAD PARKING LOT - NIGHT 67

The SUV careens out of control and with a shriek of tearing
metal HITS A MALL PARKING LOT RAMP and FLIPS THROUGH THE
AIR In a hellacious crash the vehicle finally bangs to a
stop in the middle of the parking lot Silence

INT SUV - UPSIDE DOWN - NIGHT 68

Dave is hanging upside down by his seat belt He gets his
bearings and cranes his neck over and sees HUNKS OF MEAT
flying off what had been the Detective in juicy ragged pink
and yellow layers Out from the meaty shreds come rushing
masses of the TINY WHITE DEMON ROD THINGS swirling around
the interior of the truck like rice in a blender The swarm
makes a sound that’s a kind of shrill electricity of madness
screeches and howls

Dave is frantic patting around for the clasp to the seat
belt The Little white streaks are buzzing around his face
now past his ears skipping over his skin Glass shatters in
the back seat as the others fight their way out Dave runs
his hand over his forearm and a thousand of the rods scatter
off into the air Suddenly hands are grabbing Dave pulling
at the seat belt A hand comes into view and with a flick
there is suddenly a switchblade there cutting at the strap
John cuts Dave free and drags him out of the wreckage

EXT MALL OF THE DEAD PARKING LOT - NIGHT 69

Everybody is yelling panicking at the sight of the cloud of
white insects blowing around Dave like pillow feathers The

things now settle on Dave’s arm again and are landing on his
neck and face Dave brushes the things off swats at them in
the air

John comes running from the direction of the parked beer
truck carrying one of their home-made Molotov cocktails

EXT MALL OF THE DEAD PARKING LOT - NIGHT 69A

He cracks the bottle seizes Dave’s arm by the wrist and
douses his arm with it John then produces his lighter and
before Dave can react sets Dave’s arm on fire Dave howls
and John forces him down rolling his arm in the dust
patting out the flames

Dave sits up tries to focus his eyes tries to get to his

feet falls back down on his ass He sees Amy on her knees in
the dirt bruised and battered Molly is there licking Amy’s
face

Dave notices Fred off by himself thrashing around like he
is on fire The swarm has found him and the rush of the
things pours out of the wrecked SUV like a kicked hornet’s
nest They are pouring into Fred He is coughing choking
the rods gushing into his wide-open mouth In seconds it is
over and Fred collapses as if dead

John and Dave stare toward Fred in dull shock a silence
settling over the scene Only Amy moves She sprints toward
the upended SUV roots around in there and grabs something

Fred twitches then flops onto his back then clumsily gets
to his feet John and Dave flinch and scramble to their feet
Fred-if it is still Fred- looks confused for a moment then
brushes himself off

FRED
It’s okay guys I’m okay I’m
okay

Amy comes back from the truck holding the detective’s RIOT
SHOTGUN and pushes it into Dave’s hands

FRED (CONTD)
Whoa guys Guys we’re all shook
up here Okay

AMY
(whispers )
That’s not Fred Not anymore

FRED
Guys look I don’t know what you
think you saw but I’m still Fred in
here Ask me anything I’m me We
were all in that car when the cop
exploded Any of us could be
infected or whatever but we gotta
hang together We’re like the good
guys here Right

Dave looks down as if deferring to the shotgun Molly lets

out a low growl Dave closes his eyes lets out a long breath
and relaxes the gun

DAVE
Fred go out to the highway and
flag down a car

EXT MALL OF THE DEAD PARKING LOT - NIGHT 69B

Relieved Fred turns toward the highway Dave waits for about
five seconds then steps forward jerks up the shotgun and
blows Freds head off his shoulders John sprints up toward
Fred’s prone body begins dragging it

JOHN
Get him to the wreck These things
are starting to come out of him

Amy sprints to help him and together with Dave’s help they
drag Fred’s body back to the wreckage of the SUV and lay him
against the rear door A familiar FUZZY CLOUD is emerging
from the ragged stump that had been Fred Chu’s head

EXT MALL OF THE DEAD PARKING LOT - NIGHT 69C

Dave looks at it stunned until Amy rips the shotgun from
his hands turns and one-handed fires into the gas tank of
the SUV Fred Chu’s corpse goes up in a massive fireball of
flames sending the three friends flopping to the ground
They all stumble to their feet watching thousands of these
little particles swarm out of Fred burning like sparks over
a stirred campfire They back away from the fire in the
general direction of the mall

JOHN
Do you think that’s all of them
The worms whatever they are Do
you think we got all of ‘em
Because I got a feeling that if
just a few of them get away hell
if just one of them gets out and
gets into a body they’1l multiply
Lay eggs and do what they do

As they pass the beer truck John jumps onto the open
tailgate He grabs his GEAR BAG and begins rummaging through
it John pulls on a flannel shirt and a down vest

DAVE
John what’re you doing now

JOHN
I’m not gonna stand by while some
white fuzz from another dimension
invades our world and infects every
last man woman and child We’re
gonna go through that ghost door
and clean house

He tosses Dave an automatic PISTOL

DAVE
What Why

JOHN
Cause we’re the only ones who can
We were chosen By the Soy Sauce
You in

Dave sighs

DAVE
Yeah I guess so

John holds out a BASEBALL BAT from his duffle The head of

the bat is wrapped with glued-on PAGES FROM THE BIBLE Four
large NAILS form spikes on the end Dave slings it over his
shoulder

John pulls on a welder’s FACE MASK with a wicked skull
illustration on it flips it up He brandishes a cool
PAINTBALL RIFLE jacks in an AIR TANK which compresses with a
soft whoosh John displays a stickfeed TUBE filled with
PAINTBALLS

JOHN
Modified for spray or shoot Filled
my balls with gasoline and holy
water Dealer’s choice Come on

John jumps down from the truck and leads them toward the
mall

INT MALL OF THE DEAD - NIGHT 70
They move down the desolate dark corridor and arrive at the
mysterious wall The glimmering “ghost door” awaits them

John looks at Amy and nods

JOHN
Ghost Door

AMY
All I see is a wall

John digs into his bag and hands Amy an old pair of cardboard
3D GLASSES She puts them on and the door becomes visible

AMY (CONTD)
Oh Cool

John reaches for the ghost door knob and his hand passes
right through it

JOHN
Shit It’s a Ghost Knob

With her good hand Amy reaches for the door knob and like

John her hand passes right through

DAVE

the Ghost Knob

Doesnt make any sense Justin
Shitload whatever his name was
said he needed Amy to open it

A look of determination crosses Amy’

AMY
I know why he wanted me

Very deliberately she loosens her prosthetic hand and drops
it to the floor Amy takes a deep breath and then reaches out
with her stump toward the “ghost knob” As her stump nears
the knob an illusory PHANTOM HAND becomes visible She
flexes the phantom fingers grabs hold of the knob and turns

With a rumble a VERTICAL SLIT forms in the wall and then
tears open widening The wall MELTS and peels back like a

curtain until there is a door-sized
Beyond it is a tiny round room the
steps through the door Molly trots
Dave turns puts his hands on Amy’s

no exits From the darkness a

FIGURE steps out It is Roger North Dave draws the pistol

ROGER NORTH
I have a thousand questions to ask
but no time to ask them

DAVE
(to John)

This is the guy the one with the
slug in my truck last night

JOHN

Okay Slug Man Can you explain just
what the fuck this place is

Roger turns and looks at the black cylinder

ROGER NORTH
What do you think you’re looking at

there

JOHN

Youre gonna be looking at my fist
and then Dave’s dick if you don’t-

ROGER NORTH
-Take a moment and try to

understand what you’

re seeing

Imagine a garment woven from a

single thread

And imagine that same continuing
thread was used to weave another
garment similar to the first So
you have a thread that is
simultaneously part of two
garments but at some point the
thread stops being part of one
garment and becomes part of the
other

John waves his hand impatiently

JOHN
Who gives a shit

North gestures toward the column

ROGER NORTH
This is the thread The key to
ending this is through here

DAVE
You want us to go through what
exactly What’s in there Hell Is
that what happened this thing
opened up and a bunch of you
monstrous fuckers came crawling in
That’s why we’ve got so much weird
shit in this town

ROGER NORTH

The opening has always been here
you just needed the drug to see it
This is the reason sentient life
began on your world But no man has
been able to travel back through
this portal

DAVE
(screams )
Then what the fuck are you talking

about

ROGER NORTH

The only ones who can travel back
and forth are the Shadow Men

The ones who lived but have been
torn from their bodies through
death They are unrestricted by
matter and as such can exist in
one dimension and then the next
The column you see here is a
containment that was built but not
by men It’s up to you two to pass
through

You just said no one could-

There is a reason why you have
drawn so much interest Mr Wong

and resources than you can imagine
to developing an ability to pass
from one side to the next with no
success But now we realize that

DAVE

ROGER NORTH
I have enlisted an ally from your
world

North turns away and from the darkness appear THREE SHADOWY
FIGURES Striding forward is Dr Albert Marconi and his two
black-clad female assistants

DAVE
(scoffs)
You trusted this guy Hes just an
infomercial dude

JOHN
Dont be so hasty Dave Dr Marconi
brings a lot to the table Ive
listened to his discs The guy
knows his stuff

DR MARCONI
Thank you John The source of our
current manifestation is on the
other side of this portal The
entity is called Korrok

DAVE
And what does this Korrok look
like

DR MARCONI
No one in our current dimension can
possibly know that

DAVE
Great Thats specific

DR MARCONI

You’1l know him when you see him
Believe me He can’t be destroyed
by conventional means But I do
have a plan

Marconi takes a small BACKPACK from his assistant and neatly
slides out a small CHROME CYLINDER

DR MARCONI (CONTD)
They call it the “Tripper”

DAVE
And it came from where exactly

DR MARCONI
I have followers in the military
This is an experimental Cold War
weapon designed to take down a city
the size of Moscow Contained
inside this detonator is a block of
c-4 explosive surrounded by a
highly-potent military-grade
hallucinogenic Obviously it was
never used- but it should work If
you get the opportunity detonate
itlike this

Marconi demonstrates the detonating sequence of the device

DR MARCONI (CONTD)
It may not kill this Korrok But
it’ll certainly fuck up his shit
Severely

John takes the backpack

JOHN
I like the concept Doctor

Dave looks to John who nods with steely expression

DAVE
Fine How do we get in

ROGER NORTH
Just decide that you want to and
you will

Dave steps up to the cylinder reaches out a hand and touches
the surface It’s like cut black onyx The column is as solid
as stone but then suddenly Dave sees his fingers push into
it like it was made of warm wax His hand vanishes up to the
wrist and then elbow and then he disappears into blackness

EXT GREEN FIELDS - DAY 73

Dave falls into a beautiful field of tall grass He gathers
his senses and climbs to his feet to find himself in an
immense expanse of sunny greenery with low grassy foothills
in the distance John Molly and their gear bag tumble to a
stop beside him

A distance below a CROWD OF PEOPLE are moving uphill toward
their position

Breakdown Services - Castina -— Partial Draft

There are a hundred all wearing hoods and otherwise NAKED
except for large cod-pieces Dave notices that they are
holding up a large colorful BANNER on a pole John gets to
his feet and scans the hooded nakedness

DAVE
(points to hills)
Look It’s the valley our town is
built in but there’s no town

JOHN
(ogling the bare bodies)
Yeah we’re in an alternate
universe And this is “Eyes Wide
Shut” world

The crowd silently surrounds them Molly sniffs the air

From the crowd a LARGE MAN emerges no hood wearing a suit
black with wide pinstripes and a short red tie He spreads
his arms

LARGEMAN
Gentlemen Welcome

His face is human but off This is the face from Dave’s TV
The man wears some kind of latex mask with wig

LARGEMAN (CONT’D)
Come

The man gestures in a direction and the crowd clears a path
for them Largeman leads the way through the naked crowd
Dave and John can now see the large banner clearly It is a
CARTOONISH PAINTING of Dave depicted as a muscular warrior
Molly at his feet teeth bared with the flesh of some slain
enemy in her jaws John is shown bearing a fistful of flame
and with an enormously exaggerated crotch bulge

LARGEMAN (CONT’D)
A select few interested parties
were allowed to come and observe
your arrival Our style of dress
here is quite different so we
thought removing the garments would
lessen your discomfort

JOHN
Yes It’s a nice touch

They are led down the gauntlet of nudity to a grassy hill
They reach a DOOR cut into the side of the hill leading to
an underground building The door slides open and they are
led down a hall to a large round cathedral-type chamber
