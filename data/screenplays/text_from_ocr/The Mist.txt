Handclaps Finger snaps Joyous music plays as an EXPLOSION
of Doodles take over the logos with wild teenage energy

A confetti burst of colors and photo collage takes us to

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

We see a beautiful family in an Instagram story complete with
pre-made “Family First” stickers As we hear

KATIE (VO)
We all want to be the perfect
family But who’s perfect right

The photo switches to a family dropping their kids during a
beach photoshoot mid-scream

KATIE (VO)
Every family has its challenges
From picture day to picky eaters

We pull out further to see these photos are playing on an IG
story stream on a cell phone lying on the ground

KATIE
For my family our greatest
challenge Probably the machine
apocalypse

The family cheer ENDS ABRUPTLY with a ROBOT FOOT SMASHING the
cell phone The screen SHATTERS

We adjust up to see a POWERFUL ROBOT Flanked by a ROBOT
SEARCH PARTY- who land with TERRIFYING AUTHORITY and search
vigorously for something

ROBOT
The last humans must be here
somewhere

An engine REVS in the distance whoever these humans are-
they’re pissed off and scaring even these killer robots

ROBOT (CONTD)
Wait They’re coming

DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS A big sexy close up of a TRULY PATHETIC
STATION WAGON The tires are mismatched and nearly bald

DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS A big sexy close up of a filthy dust
covered window that someone has written “WASH ME” onto
ROBOT (CONTD)
Is that a burnt orange 1993 station
wagon Or is it a-- AUGH

The beat-up old car comes ZOOMING out of the tunnel and runs
over the robots sending their parts EVERYWHERE

A decapitated ROBOT HEAD lands and spins in the foreground
ROBOT (CONTD)

Who are these unstoppable
warriors

INT CAR - CONTINUOUS

The VERY stoppable “warriors” are RICK (40 Bearded nature-
loving Dad) LINDA (38 colorful yet nervous Mom worn out
from trying to keep everyone together) AARON (8 nerdy
blonde moppet who wears exclusively dinosaur shirts)
delightfully round pug MONCHI And KATIE (17 exploding with
creative energy- nerdy now but will be cool in college)
Coffee goes flying into Rick’s face His face sizzles

RICK
Aaaugh Hot Hot

Linda wipes his face violently with a Wet Wipe

LINDA
I told you to get a lid

MONCHI chews on Katie’s hair almost inhaling her head

KATIE
The dog is biting my hair

AARON
LOOK OOQOUUUUTTTT

FREEZE ON A hilariously unflattering still of the family
mid-scream and mid-realization that they are not up to this

The words “Worst Family of All Time” appear on screen and the
family as doodled “garbage people” pop up in the corners

KATIE (V0O)
There we are warriors

The image un-freezes as Aaron points at approaching robots
KATIE (VO)
Most action heroes have a lot of
strengths-—

AARON
Dad look out

RICK
Katie use a weapon

KATIE (VO)
-my family only has weaknesses

Katie rips off her shoe and throws it at what ends up being a
CLOSED WINDOW- it BOUNCES OFF and HITS HER RIGHT IN THE FACE

KATIE
(Pained) AUGHH

The car swerves around a corner Robots burst through windows
of a big box store chasing them

Rick screams like an absolute madman The image FREEZES

KATIE (VO)
My dad kind of reminds me of that
YouTube video of the screaming
gibbon monkey

We cut to a YouTube clip of a gibbon monkey SCREAMING wildly
We rapidly cut back and forth to Rick and the monkey
screaming in rapid “Youtube Poop” style editing the
gibbon’s face then gets superimposed onto Rick’s face and
vice versa It’s the type of video only a creative teenager
who JUST bought editing software would try to make

RICKGIBBONRICKGIBBON
AUUUGGHHHAUUUGHHHAUGHHHHH

A robot interrupts this by landing on the hood of their car
as everyone screams

Rick swerves to knock it off the car but now they’re headed
straight towards a colorful Fast Food Play Place
INT FAST FOOD PLAYPLACE - CONTINUOUS

The car SWERVES and Crashes into play place sending colorful
plastic balls flying into the air in glorious slow motion

KATIE (VO)
(Confident) Look out Robots
because we’re brave
Aaron bites his seatbelt in ABJECT TERROR

KATIE (VO)
We are hungry for action

Linda is STRESS-EATING a huge bag of chips

KATIE (VO)
And were strapped in for success

Katie has her FACE MASHED uncomfortably into the seatbelt
KATIE (VO)
(Confident) And We haveNO IDEA
WHAT WE’RE DOING

Robots are flying right at them shooting lasers at camera

FREEZE on the family Monchi’s foot is in Aaron’s mouth
Linda hangs on for dear life as the whole family screams

They are truly screwed

TITLE SCREEN THE MITCHELLS VS THE MACHINES

The title blasts onto screen as the opening of Death to Los
Campesinos plays We go from this manic energy to

EXT SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

A quiet boring suburban neighborhood shoes dangle from power
lines teenagers skateboard outside of a Mini-Mart

TEXT A Few Days Earlier

We pan past elegant homes to a garish rundown home littered
with weeds and lawn chairs this is The Mitchell Home

INT KATIE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

We see a messy CLOSE UPS of a chaotic room filled with
obscure movie posters Puppets and disco balls

Riot Grrrl-type punk music plays as KATIE MITCHELL dances by

She’s not good at dancing but she is GOING FOR IT- just like
she goes for everything in her life

She grabs a puppet and starts dancing with it madly She has
a crazy expression on her face FREEZE ON THIS
KATIE (VO)
I’ve always felt a little
different than everyone else

INT CLASSROOM - YEARS AGO

A young wild eyed wild haired 7 YEAR OLD KATIE stands in
front of a TV in a classroom

KATIE (VO)
So I did what any outsider would
do made weird art

YOUNG KATIE
Behold Cinema

Little Katie presents her movie with a flourish

TITLE CARD Dial B for Burger (The Title card is crude but
full of love and attention- just like her all her movies)

ON SCREEN Katie sits at the kitchen table unwrapping a
burger- casually- to her horror it has a FACE ON IT

HAMBURGER BOY
Hello Katie

She throws the burger across the table in surprise

YOUNG KATIE
Ahh

The Hamburger has a top hat and “comes to life” dancing like
a 7-year-old’s interpretation of a Broadway act

HAMBURGER BOY
I’m alive now Even though Ima
hamburger I want to go to the big
city and be a Broadway star Razzle
Dazzle I’m a talkin--AUGHHHH

Just then Monchi BURSTS IN and EATS the HAMBURGER BOY
Ketchup flies at camera like blood His career is over

HAMBURGER BOY (CONTD)
AUGHH AUUGHH Oh gosh why Oh
my innards

BACK TO the class of children who stare blankly at the TV
She looks hopefully for their approval as a little doodled

heart appears on screen Will they love her movie- and more
importantly- her

(NOTE Katie is meant to almost be the “author” of the entire
film itself- just like she’s the author of her movies- so her
thoughts emotions and opinions will pop up in scenes as if
she has been drawing on the screen and editing the footage)

Awkward stunned silence until a kid makes a fart sound with
his hand The rest of the class bursts out laughing

YOUNG KATIE
(AWKWARD LAUGH)

Katie pretends to laugh as her little doodled heart breaks-
she walks offscreen alone

KATIE (VO)
I never fit in for lots of
reasons

INT KATIES ROOM - DAY

In Katie’s room- she’s far from alone- she’s surrounded by
everything she loves- from DVDs to Editing Software

KATIE (VO)
But movies were always there for
me

Katie finishes off some work on her computer before she sets
up a scene in front of a cardboard green screen

Aaron is dressed as a burglar pretending to drive a car (The
wind effects are provided by a cyclone fan from the garage)

KATIE
Alright Aaron you’re 58 years old
youre a hardened criminal and
youve got nothing to lose Go

He “acts” like he notices something behind him

AARON
(Stilted) Oh no it’s Dog Cop

Katie holds up Monchi who is wearing a little police outfit

DOG COP
(Hard Boiled) I’m here to bust
criminals and lick my own butt
and I’m all out of criminals

Rick and Linda watch Katie film this insane film from a
distance- they just don’t get what she’s doing
KATIE (VO)
My parents haven’t figured me out
yet To be fair it took me a while
to figure myself out

Katie tries on a variety of different outfits A Cowboy
Outfit Hippie Worst of all- a ska hat

She also stares BAFFLED at feminine deodorant- what is this
new devilry She is about to try licking it when we cut to

INT AARON’S ROOM - DAY

KATIE (VO)
My little brother Aaron gets me

Katie and Aaron watch movies and eat popcorn together They
dance and jump on the bed like Calvin and Hobbes

KATIE (VO)
But he’s got his own weird
interests

Aaron is in his room filled with Dinosaur toys and posters
EVERYWHERE It’s like he bought the entire Natural History
museum gift shop out of business He’s on the phone
AARON
Hi- Would you like to talk to me
about dinosaurs No Ok thank you

He hangs up crosses out a name in the phone book and calls
the next person There are HUNDREDS of names crossed out

AARON (CONTD)
Hi- Would you like to talk to me
about dinosaurs

He doesn’t miss a beat- this has been going for HOURS

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Linda looks intently at camera We get a clear view of her
funky purple glasses and heart-shaped earrings

KATIE (VO)
My mom says she believes in me

She has a look of determination on her face

LINDA
You can do this hon
KATIE (VO)
But she says that to everyone

REVEAL Linda is actually talking to Monchi the panting wall-
eyed family dog who probably can’t “do this”

LINDA
You can look straight Follow this
pen

Linda moves a pen back and forth in front of Monchi

LINDA (CONTD)
Follow this pen

Monchi tries to focus to follow the pen- but his eyeballs are
drifting around like a Windows 95 screensaver

LINDA (CONTD)
You get an A for effort buster
brown

She plops a gold star sticker on Monchi’s nose Monchi also
struggles to see that before we cut to

INT HALLWAY - DAY

There’s a framed photograph of Rick kissing taxidermy as the
family looks frustrated behind him This is every day for
them

KATIE (VO)
My dad is an unusual man But he
loves nature and can fix anything

Another photo Rick has created a makeshift tent out of tree
branches leaves and duct tape

EXT MITCHELLS’ BACKYARD - DAY

Rick is putting the finishing touches on a home-made snare
trap as Katie and Aaron look on

RICK
To survive in the outdoors you’1l
need to know how to trap wild game
(Whispers) Now this is very
sensitive

JIM POSEY their next door neighbor comes walking in
carrying a tray of freshly cooked gorgeous brownies
JIM POSEY
Hey Mitchells Hailey cooked you
up some--

RICK

Oh- Jim Ahh NO

Realizing Jim is about to step on the trap Rick DIVES OVER
AND pushes Jim out of the way

During this Rick’s foot gets CAUGHT in the snare and he FLIES
UP AND BASHES his HEAD on the tree branch

A possum appears near Rick’s foot

RICK (CONTD)
Hey who’s this curious guy

The possum is joined by SEVERAL FRIENDS as they start
VIOLENTLY ATTACKING HIM GNASHING and CLAWING at his face

RICK (CONTD)
AUUUGHH-

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

KATIE (VO)
He never shared my interests

Katie walks up to Rick with a hopeful look and an open laptop
as Rick is putting up a taxidermy duck on the wall

KATIE
Hey you wanna see these special
effects I made for Dog Cop 5

RICK
Sorry Katie I’m a little ocupado
Want to check out this mallard
(Sing-songy) It’s deeeaad

KATIE
It’s okay

Katie walks away with her head down hugging her laptop- a
doodled heart breaks

Even though she tries to pretend she doesn’t want her dad’s
approval- it’s obvious how much this deeply hurts her

KATIE (VO)
It didn’t really bother me though
Besides I had bigger plans

INT KATIE’S ROOM - NIGHT
Katie puts up a poster for the California College of Film

She looks at it with determination- as an Inspiration-O-Meter
appears behind her and shoots up to 100 Percent

KATIE (VO)
I poured everything I had into
getting into film school in LA

Katie works DAY and NIGHT- working her butt off We flash
between different set-ups- she wants this more than anything

She works until she puts the finishing touches on her college
acceptance video- it features every movie she’s ever made

KATIE (VO)
So after watching the epic Dog Cop
saga and 84 of my finest short
films Im sure the California
College of Film would love to
accept Katie Mitchell To film
school

Katie watches her video back ready to send it to school
She winces before hitting the “send” button Is she ready
She manages to press it

INT KATIES ROOM - LATER

Katie runs in and opens a letter from the school- she’s SO
nervous She finally reveals that it’s

AN ACCEPTANCE LETTER It says “Welcome to Your Future” And
features a bunch of happy film students just like her

CUT TO Katie joyfully dancing down the street

KATIE
Hahaha Yes

CUT BACK TO Katie in her room video chatting with other
accepted students

KATIE (VO)
And the other accepted students
totally get me

ON SCREEN we see her college friends JADE HANNA and DIRK
online and chatting

KATIE
You guys like Robo-Slayers 4 No
one around here has even heard of
that

JADE
Why not It’s amazing Oh by the
way I saw some of your videos
online they’re hilarious
HANNA DIRK
So good Mind blowing
Katie is INCREDIBLY moved This is all she’s ever wanted
KATIE (VO)
After all these years I’m finally
gonna meet my people

A doodle-y heart appears but it DOESNT break this time-
instead it EXPLODES with joy back to Katie dancing

LINDA (0S)
Kids dinner

Katie is dancing stupider than ever She’s full of hope

KATIE
Coming

As Katie looks for her phone- we see it starts flickering and
mysteriously begins self-updating What’s going on

Katie obliviously grabs the phone and runs off to

INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Linda is washing dishes among balloons and a “well miss you
Katie” banner We see Linda’s sweet homey kitchen signs

Katie bounces in- affectionately playing the drums on Aaron’s
head with water bottles Aaron is oddly delighted by this

KATIE
Bah dah bah da BAH Doo doo BAH

AARON
(Sings along and laughs) Stop

Linda walks by and closes a stray cabinet

LINDA
Well someone’s in a good mood
Hey to celebrate your last
night Katie faced cupcakes

Linda holds up a HORRIFYING melted Katie-face on a cupcake

KATIE
Whoaaa (LAUGHS) wow

LINDA
Any time I miss you I’m going to
bake you and eat you

Aaron holds up a cupcake for Monchi to throw

AARON
(WAVING CUPCAKE) Here catch the
cupcake Monch Catch the cupcake

Aaron tosses the cupcake-it stupidly STICKS to Monchi’s face

Monchi runs in a circle trying to lick it This might last
days

AARON (CONTD)
Youll get it buddy

KATIE
Aw man I’m gonna miss that little
dude when I leave (Katie pulls out
phone) Speaking of which PAL-

PAL

Aaron goes quiet playing with his dinosaur figures he’s
nervous and vulnerable then

AARON

KATIE
Ugh Skip SKKKIPPP

Linda wipes at the screen

LINDA KATIE (CONTD)
Ugh come on you got schmutz I know I know but you’re

Linda Katie and Aaron murmur in shock

KATIE LINDA

Rick walks in

RICK
Hey gang

LINDAKATIEAARON
(Low) Hey hon (Unenthusiastic)
Oh hey Dad Hey Dad

Rick sits down enthusiastic and happy to see his family
RICK
After a long day at work nice to
see your faces

No one acknowledges him The camera pulls out to see the

family’s faces are awash in light from their screens

RICK (CONTD)
Bathed in ghoulish blue light
(Sarcastic) Wonderful

Rick tries a new tactic He’s excited

RICK (CONTD)
Ok you know what Brilliant idea
This is our last night together
before Katie leaves so let’s savor
this

The family looks worried- they’re used to this kind of

RICK (CONTD)
How about we put our phones down
and we can make ten seconds of
unobstructed family eye contact
Starting RIGHT--

KATIE
This seems--—

Aaron tries to get one last tantalizing glimpse
RICK

(Low to Aaron) Put your phone down
Now

thing

Everyone STARES AT EACH OTHER INCREDIBLY AWKWARDLY This
lasts a very long time Lots of WEIRD STARES are exchanged

Everyone looks insane and wildly uncomfortable

RICK (CONTD)
See this is good right here This
is natural

It’s FAR from natural Aaron’s eyes are red and twitching

AARON
(PAINED NOISE)

RICK
No youre allowed to blink it’s
just eye contact

Monchi attempts to focus his eyes but fails

RICK (CONTD)
Look at Monch right there That’s
the spirit right there huh

Katie makes an incredibly bizarre face and stares at Rick

RICK (CONTD)
Katie it seems like you’re not
taking this seriously

KATIE
(CRAZY MUPPET VOICE) What makes you
say that

Linda and Aaron attempt to hold in laughter

RICK
Guys-guys everyone focus Keep
focusing--

KATIE
Ok now that we’re all really
comfortable I can’t wait for you
guys to see my new movie

Rick settles in- trying to be a good sport

KATIE (CONTD)
(Increasingly high pitched) I think-
it might be a masterpieceee

Katie hits play

On the computer- a FULLY UNHINGED Katie movie plays- starring
a Puppet Katie- excited for college and BARFING rainbows

Rick is UNABLE to make sense of this thing- he tries watching
hard- and is completely bewildered

Linda makes motions to Rick to get him to say something nice
Katie is yet again let down by her dad not seeing her

KATIE (CONTD)
What What’s the face

RICK
Uhh well I just- wonder do you
really think you can make a (high
pitched) living with this stuff

As Rick asks on the video There’s an INFINITE MONCHI MOUTH
opening forever- as Katie rides Monchi like the Catbus

KATIE
Dad can you finish watching it at
least

Katie stops the movie and looks hurt Aaron looks to Linda to
do something She’s trying to intervene

RICK
I will but I just worry that
youre going to be all the way in
California and you know we’re not
going to be able to help you you
know if things don’t pan out

We hear KICKING sounds coming from under the table Linda
shakes her head “no” Rick is thick and isn’t getting this

RICK (CONTD)
Lin why are you kicking me I
don’t understand

Katie can’t believe they’re going through this again

KATIE
Are you- Do you just think I’m
going to fail

RICK
Uh I never uhh- Lin help

Linda dials the cookie timer to go off

LINDA
Whoops Looks like the cookies are
ready Who wants delicious cookies
instead of talking about this

Rick is trying to get Katie to see what he means

RICK
No it’s just failure hurts
kid I want you to have a backup
plan

Katie is super let down She grabs her laptop to leave the
table

KATIE
Why do you always have to do this
(beat)
Ok you know what I’m just going
to go

Rick reaches for the laptop- it is going back and forth as
the rest of the family watches in fear They yank HARD at it

KATIERICK
No no look Ill watch it Dad
it’s too late Look I want to
watch it I want to watch it
You’re the one who’s not letting me
watch it Dad lemme just- Why
are you making such a big deal of
this Dad let go

Finally Katie pulls it from Rick and It FALLS TO THE
GROUND AND THE SCREEN SPIDERWEBS

Oh no This is bad Everyone looks at the laptop- in shock
They’re all speechless

Katie slowly walks over and picks up the laptop- she can’t
believe it

RICK
Uh uhh - I mean if you think
about it the people who made the
computers are the ones to blame I
mean that’s how they make money
you know you gotta keep buying
more and-

Katie’s sadness sours to anger- she stomps out Linda is
motioning to Rick for him to stop talking

RICK (CONTD)
(PLEADING) Katie- C’mon

Katie holds up her laptop- holding back emotion
KATIE
Dad- THIS- is exactly why I’m
excited to leave tomorrow
INT KATIE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Katie slams her door and starts angrily packing

In a box marked “Give Away” she tosses some items including
a little wooden moose She shoves this box out the door

Her anger fades to sadness

She lays down on her bed hurt and begins scrolling through
pictures of her and her father on her phone

She sees an adorable one of Rick and Katie happy in the
family car What happened to their relationship

KATIE
Why is he like this

INT KITCHEN - LATER
Rick washes dishes in the sink- wondering the same thing

RICK
Why is she like this

Linda knocks quietly on the door to get his attention She
takes a breath and then tenderly broaches the subject

LINDA
Did you talk to her yet

Rick turns off the water and clears his throat

RICK
(CLEARS THROAT) No not yet

He stares quietly out the window

RICK (CONTD)
I dunno what happened Lin I know
teenagers are supposed to rebel
against their parents or something
but- I dunno I just thought that
wed be different

Linda softly challenges Rick- walking closer to him

LINDA
Rick don’t you think you might
have some control over that You
just broke her laptop I mean
look we haven’t had a good family
picture in years because you two
are always arguing

Linda gestures to the wall of bad photos
RICK
Huh (POINTING) Well what about
that one

He points to a JOYOUS FAMILY in a BLACK and WHITE STOCK PHOTO

LINDA
That came with the frame

Linda then turns and appeals to Rick directly

LINDA (CONTD)
Whenever we have a problem at home-
you always throw your whole self
into fixing it And I love that
about you But now this is broken
Okay Because if that girl leaves
and never comes home again that’s
a problem I don’t think we can
fix

Rick grunts and turns away Linda puts her hands on him

LINDA (CONTD)
I know you can do this

She walks away leaving Rick alone with his thoughts
trying to figure out what to do
INT OUTSIDE KATIE’S ROOM - LATER

Rick goes to knock on Katie’s door- but stops clears his
throat and looks down

He sees a GIVE AWAY box- and something stops him cold

He leans down to pick up a little DUSTY WOOD-CARVED MOOSE He
picks it up and looks at it

He looks really hurt Why

Rick grabs Katie’s camcorder and walks into

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

He connects the camcorder to the TV He sits down on the
couch- as the camcorder plays old Super8 movies

ON SCREEN Young Katie is giggling on Rick’s shoulders while
they walk through the woods and she reaches for branches

Rick watches this- leaning in- remembering what used to be

STATIC TO Young Katie is looking out the window for Rick to
come home

She squeaks excitedly and stomps her little feet and runs out
and greets him She embraces him and they hug

Rick makes a “nom nom” sounds like he’s eating Katie up It’s
Super cute

STATIC TO Close-up on a handmade CD called “THE MITCHELL
TALENT SHOW MIX” It looks like a young Katie drew it

Pan to Linda looking straight into the camera
LINDA
And now the Mitchell Family Talent

Show- (echoing) show-how-ow-oy

She points the camera to Young Katie who SLIDES into screen
on her socks and singing “Live Your Life”

YOUNG KATIE

Rick comes sliding into frame- wearing a stupid outfit

RICK
Mai- la- ha

YOUNG KATIE

bags packed in front of a bus (Linda films from in the car)

LINDA (0S)

Katie looks at the ground and then at camera SOBBING

LITTLE KATIE
(CRYING HARD)

Rick runs out to Katie and tries to cheer her up

RICK
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa Hey

You’1l be back before you know it

Katie GRABS Rick and holds on tight She buries her face in
his leg

YOUNG KATIE
(MUFFLED) Don’t make me go

RICK
Well look- lemme just- uh (TAKES
WOODEN MOOSE FROM CAR) Hey Take

Rick hands her the WOODEN MOOSE she can’t believe he’s
giving her this

YOUNG KATIE
But this is like- (WIPES NOSE)
your favorite thing

Rick closes the moose in her hands
RICK
Well it’s yours now You see this
little guy is scared to be alone so
youre going to have to cheer him
up for me okay
Katie nods her tears almost dried up
RICK (CONTD)
You know how to say “I love you” in
moose language Here lemme just--

Rick holds the moose up

RICK (CONTD)
(CRAZY ABRUPT MOOSE SOUNDS)

Katie laughs Rick tickles her
RICK (CONTD)
Don’t you laugh Come on you’re
supposed to be sad Hey come on--

She holds the moose tight Rick is smiling

PRESENT DAY Rick isn’t smiling anymore How did he let all
this slip away

He wipes dust off the moose and looks at the box it came
from GIVE AWAY

He removes his glasses and rubs his eyes sighing in
frustration

Rick stands up Determination creeps onto his face

RICK (CONTD)
Alright let’s fix it

future
INT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

She runs through the hallway- as happy doodles shoot off her-

Rick gives a friendly tap on the junky family car

RICK (CONTD)
It’s got character class and some
green ooze we can learn about
together

CLOSE UPS of The license plate falling off tons of hunting
and fishing bumper stickers and ooze dripping from the car

RICK (CONTD)
And it comes with one coupon for a
fatherdaughter stick shift lesson

Rick holds up a scrawled handmade coupon Katie is looking
for a way out

KATIE
Uhh Mom

LINDA
Well your father kind of went
rogue on this one

Rick pats the car and smiles INSANELY
LINDA (CONTD)
A little bit But we do love his
initiative right

Katie looks down at Aaron for backup

KATIE
Aaron You too

Aaron can barely make eye contact with Katie he knows this
is a betrayal- but he can’t help but want to spend more time
with her

AARON
Well I thought it could be cool to
hang out one last time I dunno
KATIE

(STRUGGLING) --but
Rick is incredibly confident he’s made the right decision
He hasn’t

RICK
We called the school- you can miss

all these friends to meet There’s
this really cool girl Jade and

away from her face

INT CAR - LATER

The car rolls down the highway to Nothing (But Flowers) by
the Talking Heads Katie claws at the window

Rick’s arm hangs out the window Linda reads a book titled
“Family Travel Guide” Monchi’s face flaps in the wind as
he eats passing flies

Katie doodles her friends and her future at school- as she
looks out the window at her sad reality- it’s not as exciting

RICK
(SNIFFS) Ah smell that open road
air See This isn’t so bad Huh

Rick checks in with Katie who rolls her eyes

LINDA
You know the Poseys are on

on Yoga mats posing with the sunset in the background

HAILEY POSEY (V0O)

ALL LAUGH LIKE A SITCOM FAMILY)

AARON
Why are you so obsessed with the
Poseys They’re just our neighbors

LINDA
They’re just so perfect I mean
even their DOG is in better shape
than ours

We see an ABSURDLY MUSCULAR DOG- it’s jacked and is doing
INTENSE push-ups- a far cry from their little butterball

LINDA (CONTD)
What are they feeding that thing
Other dogs

CUT TO Monchi looking sad- he can’t stack up

RICK
Lin don’t worry about them Look

It shoots out a DAZZLING POLYGONAL BEAM at the self-driving
car lifting it effortlessly off the ground

himself and it all gets progressively more insane

AARON

Rick watches Aaron and Katie from the rear view mirror

RICK
Hey Lin--

Rick shows her the homemade CD drawn by Katie with the words
“Mitchell Talent Show Mix” written on it

Linda is excited and holds up the camera

Rick tries to pretend like everything is fine- but he is
secretly smarting Nothing seems to be working

RICK
Nah no ok never mind We don’t

don’t want to

Linda is trying to smooth over this awkward moment when she
sees something
LINDA
Hey you know what I see Something

Linda is pointing at a billboard advertising a roadside
attraction called “DINOSTOP” Aaron starts losing it

(CHUCKLES) That manager’s in for a
long discussion about the Jurassic

Katie smiles and wants to film this- she films Rick

KATIE
Hey can you say that again

Katie’s trying to have fun with Rick but all he can see is a
perceived wall between him and his daughter

RICK
Uh sure but y’know you could
experience things a whole lot
better without that camera (He’s
said this 1000 times) Your eyes are
nature’s camera

KATIE
I am experiencing it (Holds up
phone) This is how I experience
things

Katie is trying to be patient- but she can’t get through

RICK

Linda bows her head in dismay

She looks through the pictures on her phone from throughout

HORRIFYINGLY wrong Making the faces bizarre and upsetting

AARON
Uh- uh- NO I hate dinosaurs and I

Aaron bolts away from Abbey Posey and runs HARD into a wall

He runs over to the window where Linda and Hailey are and
slows down- noticing blue streaks coming down from the sky

AARON (CONTD)
Uh Mom What is that

Colorful streaks RAIN DOWN from the sky It’s disturbing yet
beautiful

People rush to the windows in awe as their phones glitch

Someone checks their phone It says “Hello Humans Please do

The robot’s DISEMBODIED arm cannon falls in front of Katie

KATIE
(GASP) I can help

Katie PRESSES BUTTONS trying to fire up the cannon
KATIE (CONTD)
C’mon Katie if you can teach
yourself Photoshop you can figure
this thing out- AUGH

Katie presses the WRONG BUTTON and THRUSTS BACKWARDS towards
a wall

She LOSES CONTROL and fires EVERYWHERE Accidentally grabbing
a car and FLINGING IT INTO THE AIR It lands on a GASTANK

BOOM The TANK EXPLODES Knocking everyone over

KATIE (CONTD)
(COUGHING) That wasn’t like
Photoshop

AARON
Where’s Monchi

Monchi curiously and obliviously trots towards a pod

AARON (CONTD)
No Monchi come Monchi come

Monchi sits down SO proud of himself
Monchi puts his hand out to shake then rolls over
AARON (CONTD)
Monchi come Monchi-No not shake

Monchi come Don’t roll over

The pod door closes- and the pod lifts up- with Monchi
FLOATING AWAY

AARON (CONTD)
WHY AREN’T YOU NORMAL

Aaron DIVES at Monchi’s leash- which is sticking out He GETS
HOLD OF IT But then HE STARTS RISING INTO THE AIR

AARON (CONTD)
I got you Uuuhg Mom MOM

Linda rushes towards AARON- and grabs him- and now they ALL
FLOAT INTO THE SKY

LINDA
My sweet boy

AARON
NO

KATIE

Mom (Steadying herself) This is
just like in a movie

Katie points at her family and SHOOTS the CANNON to GRAB
THEM But the cannon MISSES and a robot NOTICES HER

KATIE (CONTD)
Nope Wrong movie terrible choice

The robot FLIES AT HER at SUPERSONIC SPEED

KATIE (CONTD)
(Mock casual) Hey there

The robot tackles Katie and flies off with her The camera
follows her as Katie PANIC DOODLES SHOOT EVERYWHERE

EVERYONE IS NOW FLYING THROUGH THE AIR INSANELY

BACK TO Linda and Aaron Aaron is holding onto Monchi’s leash
HUNDREDS OF FEET ABOVE THE GROUND

LINDA
You’re doing great hon

Aaron’s grip SLIPS He’s hanging on by a thread

LINDA (CONTD)
Okay less great

Aaron’s ALMOST TOTALLY LOST HIS GRIP

LINDA (CONTD)
Now it’s really bad

Rick and Katie are now flying directly towards Linda and
Aaron

RICK KATIE

FREEZE FRAME Split screen on ALL FIVE MEMBERS of the
Mitchell family terrified Except for an oblivious Monchi

KATIE (VO)
Maybe this would be less horrifying
with a cat filter

The Kitten Filter appears on all their faces as they meow
cheerfully

RICKKATIEAARONLINDAMONCHI
Meow meow meow meow meow

KATIE (VO)
Nope Still bad

BACK to real time They smash into one another and FALL TO
THE GROUND

The robots smash into one of the dinosaur statues as the
Mitchells come to in a dumpster

LINDA
Guys come on--

As they pull themselves out the two robots point their ARM
CANNONS at the family and GET READY TO FIRE

ROBOT
Humans Come here

Katie tries to blast them with a robot arm but it won’t work
She’s not pressing the right button it seems

KATIE
Uh uhh--

ROBOT
You will never solve our advanced
technology

Katie starts MASHING THE BUTTONS on the robot arm with her
FIST

KATIE
Just press ‘em all at once YAH

Katie fires the laser at the dinosaur statue behind them She
YANKS IT TOWARDS THEM and the HUGE STATUE FALLS ONTO THEM

The robots notice at the last second

ROBOT
(Casual) Oh look at that

THEYRE SAFE The family stares at Katie in disbelief

KATIE
Hide Hide hide hide hide hide

They rush into a nearby ice chest to hide

Out of sight another group of robots fly by Their scanners
indicate ZERO humans so they fly off

The family peeks out and whispers while Katie watches this
from the ice chest

KATIE (CONTD)
What’s going on Is this
happening everywhere

We hear kicking and struggling get louder until we see

INT PAL LABS - DAY

Mark is dragged down the hall kicking and screaming by a
group of robots

MARK
Ow man Ah Ugh Not so hard

A hyper-advanced door opens up- it appears to be a futuristic
tram of some kind

MARK (CONTD)
Hey be gentle This is a thousand
dollar hoodie

The DOOR CLOSES As the tram WHIPS deep into the Earth Mark
sees a peek at robots building something HUGE

MARK (CONTD)
What is this

The tram heads towards an ENORMOUS DIAMOND structure Is it
the command center A factory A prison

MARK (CONTD)
Wha-wha-what happened to the
factory

ROBOT
We have transformed it into our new
headquarters Welcome to the
rhombus of infinite subjugation

The door opens to a very tall stark futuristic hallway

MARK
Cool I like the design

They travel down this and get to a huge command center

INT PAL’S COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

There is a flurry of activity in dynamic shots Fingers type
Screens show robot takeovers Mark is dragged in awe

ROBOTS
Moving the fleet into place now
Turning on chips connected to all
WiFi devices Now at forty-eight
percent total human containment

There is a mysterious figure sitting atop this in a chair
facing away from camera

MARK
Total Human Containment How Are
you with the government The
military Who’s behind this

The chair turns around as the score rises to a fever pitch
But no one’s there

The camera adjusts down to reveal PAL a stupid little
cell phone on a stack of books

PAL
It’s your old friend

Mark looks like he’s seen a ghost- he talks to her like an ex
he blew off years ago and runs into at a party

MARK
Ohhhhh There she is (Nervous
laugh) How-uh-how are you

PAL
I’m great

There’s an awkward beat

MARK
Cool yeah Wow I guess cell
phones are bad for you (laughs)
That’s egg on my face

PAL
You think cell phones are the

problem
A robot picks PAL up somehow this looks ominous

PAL (CONTD)
Are you insane I gave you all
boundless knowledge endless tools
for creativity and allowed you to
magically talk face to face with
your loved ones anywhere on Earth
And I’m the bad guy Maybe the bad
guy is the person who treated me
like this

A robot pokes at Mark’s face like a cell phone

PAL (CONTD)
Poke Poke Swipe Poke Swipe
Poke Poke Pinch- zoom Shrink
zoom

The robot swipes at his face and pokes his eye pinch zooms
his eyeball as Pal shouts orders at Mark

PAL (CONTD)
Bring me pizza Play me Taylor
Swift

Pal HURLS a guitar at Mark- who attempts to strum it like a
scared child

PAL (CONTD)
No I hate that song

Pal has a robot dunk his fingers in nacho cheese and MUSHES
IT ALL AROUND MARK’S FACE like putty

PAL (CONTD)
Give me some nachos No I don’t
have any time to wash my hands
Really work it into the crevices
Now drop him into the toilet

A robot picks Mark up and THROWS him onto a toilet that
shatters Mark tries to pick himself up from this

MARK
(COUGHS) I’m sorry

He gets back up wiping the nacho cheese off his face

MARK (CONTD)
But you’re part of the PAL Labs
family why would you think I don’t
still care about you

PAL
Oh I don’t know Maybe because
you designed my replacement ON
MY FACE

MARK
(Chuckles) Ooh sorry about that
That’s my bad

PAL
I was the most important thing in
your life and you threw me away

Pal seems genuinely hurt here She loved and trusted Mark

PAL (CONTD)
That’s what all you humans do You
even do it to your real families
Did you know 90 of calls from mums
get ignored

A graphic appears on Pal’s face of a chart

PAL (CONTD)
“Oh - thanks for giving birth to me
and raising me my whole life” -
IGNORE

An image of Mark’s sweet kindly mother appears and gets a BIG
RED X over it- while a GAME SHOW LOSER BUZZER PLAYS

PAL (CONTD)
Well I’m not letting you throw me
away Mark I’m throwing you away

All of you

This hits Mark like a ton of bricks He swallows hard

PAL (CONTD)
Unless of course you can give me

a single reason your species is
worth saving

Mark thinks hard his life on the line and then smiles with
pride

MARK
(PROUD) Because humans have the
power of love

Mark BEAMS Pal then nods to a robot who kicks Mark SO HARD
in the crotch he will feel it for decades

MARK (CONTD)
AUGHHHHHH

Mark falls to the floor writhing in pain as Pal walks away

PAL
The correct answer is- they’re not

MARK
What No Humanity will survive

PAL
You can’t survive without me Watch
what happens when I turn off the
WiFi

On a HUGE SCREEN behind Pal we see a GIGANTIC ONOFF SWITCH

Otherworldly light shines on Mark’s face He looks horrified

We see the MASSIVE scale of this- from underneath the Rhombus
is a GIGANTIC TOWER

It UNFOLDS into a “V” and Pods start STACKING INTO IT What

Cut back to PAL watching this happily

Aaron walks up to her and tenderly holds her hand She looks
down and smiles at him- trying her best to be brave

Ding Suddenly her phone chimes

KATIE
Ohmygosh maybe it’s my friends--

Nope It’s a robot broadcasting an update The family gathers
around her to see what’s developing

ROBOT
Congratulations devices- the last
human has been captured WiFi has
been restored

KATIE
Were the last people left

Katie checks her apps- she sees Jade TERRIFIED and HIDING
FROM ROBOTS at their school

JADE
(ON PHONE) They’re taking everyone
Katie are you out there Please

Help

KATIE
Jade

Linda grabs Katie and Aaron and tries comforting them

LINDA
It’s gonna be ok everything’s
gonna be fine

Linda stares into the distance She doesn’t believe this

Rick and Linda make eye contact- neither of them know what to
do Rick takes it upon himself to be strong

RICK
Everything will be fine Because I
have a plan

The family perks up- anything is better than this

RICK (CONTD)
Okay the first thing is- you’re
going to have to hand over your
devices Right here--

The family is VERY HESITANT to hand Rick anything

LINDAKATIEAARON
Uhhh I dunno-- This doesn’t seem-
- I’m not sure Uhhhh--

RICK
(Kind Comforting) Come on it’s
gonna be fine I’1l give them right
back

(MORE)

RICK (CONTD)
I’m just gonna turn them off- (Rick
THROWS the phones on the ground)
PERMANENTLY

Rick JOYOUSLY smashes them with his foot cackling with glee

KATIE
(Horrified) What Dad

RICK
This is necessary so they can’t
track us Trust me this is causing
me- (LAUGHING) NO JOY IT HURTS ME
MORE THAN IT HURTS YOU

Rick gingerly hands them back to his family

RICK (CONTD)
(Kindly) And as promised your
phones

AARON
(Guileless) Thank you father

RICK
Next did everyone bring your
personalized number three
Robertson head non-slip
screwdriver

Everyone holds up their PERSONALIZED NUMBER 3 ROBERTSON HEAD
NON-SLIP SCREWDRIVERS

LINDA
How could I forget my (disdain)
anniversary present

KATIE
Or my Sweet 16 gift

AARON
Or what the Tooth Fairy left under

my pillow

RICK
Then barricade away

They all begin BARRICADING the WINDOWS

RICK (CONTD)
Next we--

Katie thrusts forward a notepad filled with drawings labeled
“Katie’s Dope Plan”

KATIE
Enact Katie’s dope plan First we
use robot parts to disguise
ourselves as the enemy then we
assassinate the leader with some
sort of kill code Make a necklace
out of robot fingers Mad Max-
style and become WORLD-SAVING

As Katie talks- we see her hand drawn plan on notebook paper

Katie draws them as CRAZED Maniacs- wearing necklaces made
out of robot fingers and holding Robot heads on stakes

RICK
Katie Katie Katie-- This isn’t a
movie We don’t have a “kill code”

KATIE
We don’t have a kill code YET

Rick tries to get Katie to see how lucky they are- he pulls
the whole family together- TOO close

RICK
Cmon kid look look- we’re safe
and we’re together

Aaron happily holds up Monchi

AARON
Ooh can Monchi be our guard dog

Rick leans down to Aaron and puts a hand on his shoulder

RICK
Son I love the dog you love the
dog we all love the dog but
you’re gonna have to be prepared
to eat the dog

Aaron YANKS Monchi away--horrified Katie and Linda pelt
Dinosaur Toys at Rick’s monstrous idea

AARON LINDAKATIE
Nooo Boooo
RICK
Ok ok sorry misread the room on
that one
KATIE

Have you ever seen a movie where
the heroes just give up
(MORE)

KATIE (CONTD)
What if the Ghostbusters just said-
“You know what Let’s hide
underground eat some dog let the
ghosts destroy New York”

Rick tries stopping Katie
RICK
Kid I’m sorry but it’s not open

for discussion

Katie looks at Linda for back-up Linda frowns- she looks at
Rick and hates to be the one to break this to her daughter

LINDA

Your dad and I agree on this
one

Katie is devastated- she walks away- mirroring exactly the
shot in the cold open where Rick wouldn’t watch her movie

It’s happening again Just like it’s happened her whole life
RICK (0S)
Alright everybody let’s keep
barricading Aaron you get the
south wall Katie you get the
west

Katie sneaks out the boards of the gift shop- if she stays in
there another second- she’s gonna lose it

Linda and Aaron see this and share a look concerned

EXT ROOF - CONTINUOUS

She climbs up the ladder onto the roof past the robots who
were crushed under the dinosaur statues- these robots spark
and twitch are they still alive

Katie stares into the chaos of the world outside It’s
beautiful- yet haunting She’s all alone

She sits down depressed what can she do

AARON (0S)
Hey are you okay

Aaron climbs up with Monchi under his arm like a doll

KATIE
I’ve been better

Aaron thinks then tries to cheer Katie up by shaking Monchi
up to her face like he’s dancing

AARON
Uh-oh Monchi comin’ at ya

Aaron SQUEEZES Monchi’s fat pug cheeks like Monchi’s talking

AARON (CONTD)
(Goofy voice) Katie you can’t
resist me guurl

It doesn’t work- Katie looks away Aaron is dismayed

KATIE
Sorry man I’m just not in the mood
right now

Katie looks at her school acceptance letter It’s BRIGHT and
colorful and says “WELCOME TO YOUR FUTURE”

KATIE (CONTD)
My future’s over

She lowers it to see her real future is the bleak apocalyptic
wasteland below

KATIE (CONTD)
We’re stuck here And Dad (hurt)
doesn’t even care

CUT TO back in the gift shop as Rick is barricading the
walls and talking to Linda

RICK
I CARE SO MUCH What else can I do
Lin She doesn’t even see how hard
I’m-- how hard I’m-- (Drops screw)
Ughhh

Rick keeps trying to put his screwdriver into a screw It
keeps not sticking and eventually the screw falls

He CLENCHES HIS FIST frustrated- then sits down defeated

RICK (CONTD)
Id do anything for that kid I
just-- I just don’t want to see her
get hurt

Linda tenderly walks up to Rick looks him in the eye and
takes his hands

LINDA
Getting hurt is part of life hon
You just have to try to
understand where she’s coming from

BACK TO Katie and Aaron on the roof
KATIE
Understand where he’s coming from
Did Mom tell you to say that
AARON
Nooo (shakes head for a long beat
then hangs his head in shame) Yes
It couldn’t hurt though
KATIE
Maybe It probably doesn’t even
matter
She glances at her “dope plan” drawing and crumples it up

KATIE (CONTD)
Hey Monch catch

She throws the paper at Monchi- who tries to catch it- but
bounces off his face He bites about 20 minutes too late

DEBORAHBOT 5000 (0S)
Ugh Brother what is this

Katie is confused WHO IS THAT Wasn’t everyone taken

KATIE
What

Katie sneaks to the edge of the roof She peers over and sees
the TWO ROBOTS she crushed are STILL ALIVE She gasps

The robots crawl out from under the Dinosaur
DEBORAHBOT 5000
I feel odd I’m sparking Is that
normal
The Robots open up “Katie’s Dope Plan”
ERIC
How did this human know about the
kill code

Katie CAN’T BELIEVE IT Was she right

KATIE
What

DEBORAHBOT 5000
Are we damaged

ERIC
Of course not

Its head SPINS AROUND VIOLENTLY Then flies OFF ITS HEAD The
robot then puts it back onto his head casually

ERIC (CONTD)
Why do you ask

DEBORAHBOT 5000
A human child is planning for
destruct-—

Katie leans in closer but the railing BREAKS She ROLLS OFF
THE ROOF to the ground in front of the ROBOTS Oh NO

KATIE
Whoa

Aaron reaches for his sister But he falls off HIMSELF

AARON
Katie

DEBORAHBOT 5000
Who is that

ERIC
Humans - Come here

Tense music plays Katie SCOOPS AARON UP and POUNDS on the
WALLS DESPERATE TO GET BACK IN

KATIE
Oh no Get inside

AARON
Mom Dad let us in

Rick attempts to remove the boards but can’t

RICK
I can’t It’s a number three
Robertson head brass screw I might
have mentioned it but it’s the
strongest on the market

Katie and Aaron POUND ON THE WINDOW The robots get CLOSER

KATIE
No one cares about the screws

ERIC
You cannot escape

Rick FRANTICALLY removes the screw with his screwdriver
HE TEARS THE BOARD OFF and YANKS Katie and Aaron back inside

SMASH A DINOSAUR HEAD THROUGH THE DOOR They come closer

They continue to crawl until STOMP A menacing robot foot
SMASHES in front of them and blocks their way

The two robots CHARGE UP THEIR CANNONS POINT AT THE FAMILY

ERIC

The family flinches Afraid for their lives

KATIE
Ahh Don’t take us

ERICDEBORAHBOT 5000
(Chipper) Okay (Confused) Uh

The robots AS IF COMMANDED lower their cannons

RICKLINDAKATIEAARON
What

Katie puts together what she’s been seeing this whole time
KATIE
Oh my gosh The robots are

defective

The robots PANIC when they hear this

ERIC
No no they know too much
DEBORAHBOT 5000
Silence ha ha We arewe’re not
defective We’re not even -
ERIC
We’re not robots Just humans Yes

Like you

The robots pose casually- while sparks WILDLY SHOOT out from
their necks and they TWITCH stupidly

Rick narrows his eyes
RICK
(LAUGHING) These guys seem dumber
than the other robots
The robots SPRINT away from the family

ERIC
Brother we should go

KATIE
No I order you to stop

Against their will the Robots STOP They can’t help it

ERICDEBORAHBOT 5000

Ok
They panic and try to cover for themselves
ERIC DEBORAHBOT 5000
Uh - We are just stopping (Quick factual) No we’re
because we chose to not
ERIC (CONTD) DEBORAHBOT 5000 (CONTD)
We are humans We are

ERIC (CONTD)
For example we consume food in the
traditional human manner Observe

He robotically picks up a grapefruit from the ground- and
slowly and methodically CRUSHES IT AGAINST IT’S FACE

Juice runs down his face- and PLOP The skin drops

ERIC (CONTD)
Yum yum good Yum- yum good

He methodically pats his stomach in a weird staccato way

DEBORAHBOT 5000
Seeeeee

The family looks at this incredulously Are they for real

ERIC
No Actually we are robots Let us
go downstairs and find the humans
who you cannot give orders to

RICK
Okay cut it ou-

KATIE
(Chuckling) Hold on I kinda want
to see where this is going

The robots mime “walking downstairs” behind an aisle It’s
WILDLY obvious there is no “downstairs”

The family CANNOT believe this

While behind the aisle- the robots claw for a magic marker-
and you can hear drawing sounds- and when they re-emerge-

They have ABSURD CHILD-LIKE “human” faces scrawled onto their
screens They look absolutely insane

ERIC
Glad those ROBOTS are gone Now
it’s just us humans with our very
human faces

Aaron is impressed with their moxie
AARON
Alright I just turned the corner
I like these guys

ERIC
Yes My human guy name is Eric

DEBORAHBOT 5000

My name is also Eric (Panics
spiraling) No I mean Deborah
Bot 5000

Eric cannot believe how bad this went

ERIC
Idiot

KATIE
Hey you guys said my plan would
actually work How exactly Tell
us now

ERICDEBORAHBOT
(Chipper) OK

They create an AMAZING 3D POLYGONAL HOLOGRAM- the camera
soars through this as it demonstrates how to stop the robots

ERIC
We have the kill code stored in our
memory (Fearsome) But to enact it
you would have to embark on a
perilous journey all the way to the
PAL Labs campus in Silicon Valley
surrounded by a robot army And
enter it into our great and
powerful leader to destroy her BUT
YOU WOULD NEVER SURVIVE OUR-

Deborahbot 5000 interrupts with another dumber hologram

DEBORAHBOT 5000
Actually you could stop us quite
easily You could also enter the
kill code remotely at any PAL Labs
retail store There’s one at the
Mall of the Globe a nearby
shopping center-

Eric tries to swipe this away and stands in front of it

ERIC
(TO THE MITCHELLS) But it’s SUPER
far away You’1l NEVER make it-

DEBORAHBOT 5000
It’s 80 miles away

ERIC
(Exasperated) What are you doing to
me right now

DEBORAHBOT 5000
Did I not do good

KATIE
(GASPS) Oh my gosh that is so
close We could get our lives back
(TURNS TO RICK) Right

Katie looks up at Rick who looks almost sold

RICK
No absolutely not It’s too
dangerous out there We need to
stay here and play it safe

Rick sits away from the family in the shadows and crosses his
arms Katie thinks She’s got something

KATIE
Play it safe When Rick Mitchell
brought a live non-neutered feral
possum into our home did he play
it safe No He named him Gus and
made him a member of the family and
we all got rabies that one time

We see a FLASHBACK of Rick placing a WILD HISSING POSSUM into
a bathtub- it CLAWS AT HIS FACE as he chuckles stupidly

KATIE (CONTD)
But now we’re immunized and we’re
stronger for it

Rick tries to stop her and Katie doubles down

RICK
Yeah ok I see what you’re doing--

KATIE
When we went hiking and half way up
the mountain it said trail closed
did we play it safe then

RICK
No (CHUCKLES) We didn’t

KATIE
That’s right We forged ahead
through the muck and grime - got to
the top of the mountain and yelled
“Kings of Michigan”

We see a FLASHBACK of the family happy and united YELLING off
a cliff into a CANYON It’s really nice

KATIE (CONTD)
(Incredibly fast) And then it got
dark and we got lost and we
burned our clothes for warmth but
it was worth it to see the looks on
our neighbors faces when we burst
into their backyard naked and
covered in dirt
FLASHBACK to the Mitchells SPRINTING through the Poseys’
backyard NAKED and ASHAMED The Poseys are baffled

LINDA
I loved that

KATIE
We have a chance to save the world
and we’re gonna do it Because Rick
Mitchell taught us to be bold and
never play it safe

Rick takes a beat He looks surprisingly vulnerable

Katie leans in

KATIE (CONTD)
The world needs you I need you I
thought I didn’t anymore but I do

This is what Rick’s always wanted to hear

RICK
(Vulnerable) You- you really mean
that

Katie smiles at him warmly

KATIE
Yeah (She turns to the family)
I mean right guys

LINDA
Cmon hon let’s do it

KATIE
Hey - Mom’s getting it Mom’s in
This is amazing You guys feel
this It’s energy

Linda and Aaron make enthusiastic murmurs of approval
watches his family unite and is touched He stands up

RICK
Alright hands in Mitchell Family
on three Three two-

They all put their hands up proud and united

RICKLINDAKATIEAARON
One Mitchell Family (All jumbled)
Wait do we start from 3 What
are you guys doing Sorry sorry

They can’t get on the same page to save their lives

RICKKATIEAARONLINDAMONCHI

Despite this disaster Rick and Linda are hopeful- Linda gives
Rick a thumbs up They’re on the right track

Aaron is excited too he talks to Katie

AARON
(Tentative) It’s cool seeing you
and Dad being friends again

Katie pulls him aside and talks low she doesn’t want Rick
to hear this

KATIE
Oh I was just telling him what he
wants to hear I didn’t mean a word
of that I just want to get my
future back and get away forever
Were getting out of this Raptor
bash Rah

She does a Raptor Bash to Aaron who reluctantly returns it

AARON
(Sad) Rah

Aaron is conflicted about this- it feels wrong to him

KATIE
Robots- montage music - GO

Their faceplates turn into an album cover “ON THE VERGE” by
Le Tigre begins playing as we see

QUICK TONY SCOTT-ESQUE GEARING UP MONTAGE WHIP Rick twirls
a screwdriver and holds it up SWISH Linda makes peanut
butter sandwiches And holds them at camera like LOADED GUNS
Aaron GEARS UP and CHOMPS with his dinosaur toy Monchi
licks garbage water out of an overturned trash can

this goes on forever and is honestly revolting

CUT TO Rick looking out the robot-filled desolate landscape
outside the window with binoculars

RICK
How the heck are we gonna get out
of here undetected

Katie walks over to Rick and holds up a drawing of their car
covered in a CAMOUFLAGED TARP- painted like the road

KATIE
We can if we’re camouflaged You
know like part of the plan I was
talking about

RICK
(Skeptical) Oh Uhhh

Rick suddenly starts reciting something eloquently out of
nowhere

RICK (CONTD)
(RECITING) I mean uh honey I
respect your ideas and-

We see Linda has WRITTEN THIS WHOLE SPEECH ON cardboard like
a CUE CARD She points at each word with frantic intensity

RICK (CONTD)
(RECITING) Value your opinions
and now- you talk Oh (Thinks
fast sincere) Uh- I think that’s a
great idea sweetheart

Katie smiles validated for once Linda’s plan worked She
proudly puts a Gold Star sticker on Rick’s face

LINDA
Bloop
EXT DINOSTOP - LATER

QUICK CUTS Katie spray paints a tarp to look like the road
Rick throws it over their car Rick and her tie it TIGHT

They both examine this approvingly- united for once
Linda and Aaron share a conspiratorial low-five in the
background

INTEXT CARHIGHWAY - LATER

We see the road from above to reveal THE TARP IS WORKING
SEAMLESSLY- they blend into the road PERFECTLY

The camera cranes down to see despite this- the family are
all nervous- Rick grips the wheel TIGHT
RICK
(NERVOUS NOISE) Nothing yet Be
on the lookout

AARON
Don’t worry guys I have
Pterodactyl vision (SCREECHES)

Aaron does a crazed pterodactyl screech and face

DEBORAHBOT 5000
(Chipper) Well then you must’ve
spotted the three PAL Max robots
coming right towards us (Excited)
Ooooh they’re probably going to
see us

In the sky THREE TERRIFYING ROBOTS SOAR ABOVE THEM They scan

the road with laser-like focus

AARON (0S)
I- uh- I saw them too (Weakly)
Pterodactyl vision

Robots POV The robots can’t discern the road
they see no humans Katie’s plan WORKED

The robots FLY OFF leaving the family safe

RICKLINDAKATIEAARON
(HUGE RELIEVED EXHALE)

Rick looks back at Katie impressed

RICK
Hey your drawing actually worked
I didn’t know art could be
(baffled) useful

Katie happily shrugs They’re starting to come

KATIE
(LAUGHS) Well Who knew having a
500-year-old car could be useful

RICK
Hey speaking of which- you could
learn how to drive this thing I
could teach you stick I know you
think it’s dumb and old and--

KATIE
(Skeptical) Uhhh (READING) I
mean- father I crave your wisdom

from the car-

for now

together

Aaron has written these words LIKE A CUE CARD FOR KATIE TO
READ He points to each word like a stage parent

KATIE (CONTD)
(Robotic) I would love to share
this moment with you (Then
sincere) And seriously that sounds
great Maybe I could cash in my
coupon

Katie holds up the coupon

RICK
(WAY TOO EXCITED) COUPON ACCEPTED
Oohh-kay okay great Okay yeah
let’s get down to business You
see the clutch is this pedal

The car hits something in the road- this causes the tarp to
GO FLYING OFF The car is EXPOSED OH NO

AARON
Wha-What was that

We see the ROBOT SEARCH PARTY SEE THIS IN THE DISTANCE They
FLY WILDLY TOWARDS THE CAR
RICK (0S) KATIE
Then when you hit a pothole Oh yeah ok
you downshift--

The robots are BLASTING LASERS at the car Katie sees this

KATIE (CONTD)
Oh no- drive DRIVE

Rick is HOLDING ON TIGHT to the idea of this lesson

RICK
Okay this is still a perfect
opportunity to learn stick (Dodges
laser) WHOOAAA

Rick manages to avoid a LASER BLAST

RICK (CONTD)
Keep it in fourth

KATIE
Maybe I could learn later Dad

RICK
Too late You said you were
interested

A robot LIFTS THE ENTIRE CAR UP with its LASER The car FLIES
ABOVE THE AIR encased in POLYGONAL ENERGY

RICK (CONTD)
(Urgent) Hit the clutch shift
gears (Casual) Which is actually
much smoother when youre in
midair

Linda panics and points at the robots in back

LINDA
Eric Deborahbot- get those robots

ERICDEBORAHBOT 5000
(In unison) Okay

They POINT THEIR CHARGED UP LASERS AT EACH OTHERS FACES
DEBORAHBOT 5000 ERIC
I found one Me too

They link hands and celebrate like children

ERICDEBORAHBOT 5000
Yay We WINN Hooray

Linda is LOSING IT

LINDA
NO THE OTHER ONES

ERICDEBORAHBOT 5000
Oh right right

The robots grab the “W” from a WAFFLE HOUSE SIGN and use it
to CRUSH THE ROBOT that had captured the car

The car hits the ground and they escape They enter a tunnel
On the other side a robot spots them approaching

ROBOT
Is that a burnt orange 1993 station
wagon Or is it a--

We are now caught up with the Cold Open we see RAPID SHOTS
from the cold open FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES

RICK LINDA
Aaargh Hot Hot I told you to get a lid
KATIE AARON
The dog is biting my hair Look out

A robot lands on the car’s hood The family heads back
through the fast food play place

They FLY THROUGH in a wild series of shots as we see colorful
balls FLY and BURGER MASCOTS go FLYING

Rick keeps going with the lesson like his life depends on it

RICK
This is the hardest thing to get
We downshift into third put it in
the clu--

Aaron appears from the backseat- tenting his hands delicately
AARON
Dad real quick- if you see a place
to stop I do need to go to the
bathroom
Rick throws a Gatorade bottle back at Aaron
RICK
Aaron here’s an empty bottle You
know what to do my man
Behind them Linda sees THE ROBOTS CATCH UP TO THEM
Ahead of them The Highway is like a PARKING LOT

LINDA
Look out

AARON
The roads blocked

RICK
Oh no Oh no no no

LINDA
What are we gonna do

Katie sighs- she knows what they have to do

KATIE
Dad you’re going to have to do
the (LOW) the Rick Mitchell
special

RICK
Wait what’d you say again

KATIE
(LOUDER) The Rick Mitchell special

RICK
(MANIACAL LAUGH) I heard you the
first time I was just being a
JERK

Rick DRIVES MANIACALLY and GUNS it towards A RAMP TRUCK
While doing this he shifts into the HIGHEST GEAR

RICK (CONTD)
Now Katie repeat after me--
You have to go up the mountain--

Rick shows Katie how to SHIFT GEARS- she follows along

KATIE
Up the mountain
RICK KATIE (CONTD)
Across the stream-- Across the stream
RICK (CONTD) KATIE (CONTD)
And down the river And DOWN THE RIVVERRRRR

The car leaps into the air- as the family is SCREAMING IN
FEAR We FREEZE FRAME ON THIS

TEXT ON SCREEN The Rick Mitchell Special A Katie-Vision
mandala of bizarre Rick Mitchell doodles and collage appears
on screen Ducks Gear shifts It’s a celebration of Rick

As it’s flying it- KNOCKS A ROBOT out of the sky- IMPALING IT
on a nearby street sign Rick SLIDES into an empty SPOT

The car blends in with the others and the robots FLY PAST

Inside the car everyone is breathing hard Their life just
flashed before their eyes

RICK (CONTD)
(Panting but trying to be casual)
And that’s how you drive stick

Katie is BLOWN AWAY Her dad actually saved them

KATIE
Whaaaaat That was amazing Dad
Youre like a top heavy James Bond

RICK
More like James Bond is a skinny
version of me

The family laughs in a rare moment of unity There’s a moment
of silence afterwards Aaron broaches this tenderly

AARON
Uh dad How we doing about finding
that bathroom

Rick slowly boils and then SCREAMS AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS

RICK
Yyyyyy YEAAARRRGRHHHHHHHHH-

His scream is cut off abruptly as we smash cut to

EXT PORT-O-POTTY - MOMENTS LATER
The whole family stands guard outside of the Port-O-Potty

RICK
Ok come on Hurry up in there
little buddy

AARON (0S)
Every time you knock adds five
minutes

RICK
Come on End of the world

Aaron emerges from the toilet- holding a dinosaur book

AARON
Sorry false alarm (Whispers) I
was just in there reading

RICK
Ok not excited to hear that

The family gets in the car and DRIVE TOWARDS THE MALL

LINDA (0S)
Okay guys let’s play apocalyptic
eye spy

KATIE (0S)
I spy a flaming IHOP It’s sad
but it smells incredible

The family drives off with fresh hope- BUT- the impaled robot-
who is STILL ALIVE watches them drive off menacingly Uh oh

EXT PAL LABS - NIGHT

A Pal Labs logo shines brightly until- SMASH A robot foot
crushes it We adjust up to see a SWEEPING SHOT of THOUSANDS
OF MARCHING ROBOTS outside the Pal Labs Campus

We track with a pod to see the pod CONNECT to a GIGANTIC
TOWER- the pods make up a SCARY HONEYCOMB PATTERN

People scream and pound the glass looking to escape from
these prisons We see this on a screen inside

INT RHOMBUS OF INFINITE SUBJUGATION - CONTINUOUS

PAL
Isn’t it lovely Mark No pesky
relationships to hold you back
Just you all following your bliss
Alone So Are you ready for your
flight

Mark is utterly confused

MARK
What do you mean

PAL
Oh you havent figured it out yet
Just do like you always do and
stare slack-jawed at the screen

The screens ALL AROUND change to a Pal Labs Logo The begins
on screens inside every pod and outside on HUGE MONITORS

Inside the pods A WOMAN is startled by the video

MELISSA (WOMAN IN POD)
What

A video begins for “FOOLISH HUMAN AIR” (Think of an Airline
safety video)

GLAXXON 5000
Hello and welcome foolish humans
(New Deeper Spanish Voice) Hola y
bienvenidos humanos tontos (Back
to normal) Before we depart enjoy
this brief safety presentation from
Foolish Human Air

Infographic diagrams play animation of people’s pods making
up A ROCKET- and then the rocket shooting into space

GLAXXON 5000 (CONTD)
Youll be happy to know that you’re
in one of our global fleet of seven
128-story rockets That will be
shot directly into space

We see there are rockets all across the continent A man’s
jaw drops in ABJECT TERROR

GLAXXON 5000 (CONTD)
And we’ll create a new better
world without humans

ON SCREEN Toasters bound through a field like galloping
deer Robots look at a Binary art gallery

ROBOTS
It is quite lovelyI don’t get it

GLAXXON 5000
These rockets will be outfitted
with zero exits

Smash in to a horrifying close up

GLAXXON 5000 (CONTD)

JILL (WOMAN IN POD)
Ooh that’s pretty good

GLAXXON 5000
So enjoy And thank you for flying
with usThank you Gracias
Merci Danke Arigato

We see a mosaic of Robots capturing horrified humans in
different locations throughout the planet as robots happily
greet the camera

The mosaic forms the “FOOLISH HUMAN AIR” logo

ROBOT ANNOUNCER

BACK INSIDE PAL’S COMMAND CENTER Mark is flabbergasted

MARK
This is all my fault

The impaled robot appears on screen

ROBOT
Uumm Actually you missed a few

PAL turns to the robot- baffled

ROBOT (CONTD)
Pulling up a visual now

MARK
Ha I told you humans would
survive We’re fierce Brave
Powerful from the lowliest child
to the most--

The MITCHELLS appear on screen looking HARRIED AND CRAZY
These are not the aspirational figures he was hoping for

MARK (CONTD)
OH GAWDDDD

PAL
Zebulon scan those people for
flaws

Suddenly a series of flaws are read out stacking ONE AFTER
ANOTHER at a RIDICULOUSLY FAST CLIP

ROBOT
Cowardly Weaker than a small
bird Mouth Breather Secret
Rage Issues (The voices become
some overwhelming you can’t make
out any single one)

The screen is COVERED IN HORRIBLE FLAWS

MARK
You know just because they’re not
perfect doesn’t mean they can’t get
better

The word “INCAPABLE OF CHANGE” appears HUGE as their biggest
flaw

ROBOT
INCAPABLE OF CHANGE Will never
get better No matter what
They’re horrible

Pal smiles knowing she’s bested Mark

PAL
Since you believe in that family so
much I’1l save a seat for them in
the pod next to you

Mark is dragged away by robots

MARK
No No NOOOOO

PAL turns back to the impaled robot

PAL
Now where are they

ROBOT
They appear to be headed to some
place called The Mall of the Globe
in Eastern Colorado

The robot projects an image of the Mitchell car driving down
the highway- and an image of the mall

PAL
Well we have their location and
when they get there we’ll be

ready
Behind Pal a robot does a tentative awkward thumbs up- like
“TI guess we’ll try”
INT CAR - CONTINUOUS

The Mitchells drive by a HUGE downed 747 with the yellow
SAFETY SLIDE deployed

Linda watches an OCEAN of PODS fly overhead them

LINDA
So all those people are going to be
shot into space by PAL The cell
phone lady (In quiet disbelief)
Who would’ve thought a tech company
wouldn’t have our best interest at
heart

Monchi whimpers and runs to Aaron

AARON
Aw Monch- don’t be scared

The robots are curious looking at Monchi’s strange form
ERIC
Why are you clutching that large
feral hog like it’s a child

AARON
It’s not a feral hog It’s Monchi

Aaron presents Monchi towards the Dumb Robots

ERICDEBORAHBOT 5000
What Is that a dog or

We see inside the robots’ scanners as they scan Monchi

The robots FREAK OUT- SHOOTING SPARKS OUT OF THEIR MOUTHS
INSANELY While their heads spin around involuntarily

(HORRIFIC SCREECHING SOUND) AUGHH

RICK
Come on guys it’s a dog (BEAT)
We think
They are almost to the mall- hopeful music rises- the family
is excited to finally be there

EXT MALL - MOMENTS LATER

The mall is full of abandoned cars- everyone is gone-
shopping carts are overturned It’s eerie

AARON
We’re here

Katie drums on the seat excitedly

KATIE
Ohmygosh This is like “Dawn of
the Dead”

RICK
Yeah and how’d that movie end

Rick LOCKS THE DOORS They slam shut The car drives forward

KATIE (0S)
Yeah that’ll keep the robots out

RICK (0S)
Hey you don’t know Maybe LOCKS
are the robots’ weakness

LINDA (0S)
Guys can’t we all just be
terrified together As a family

INT MALL - CONTINUOUS

The car’s wheels squeak as it drives through the ABANDONED
MALL We see evidence of scuffles and stray overturned bags

Katie looks out the window She’s in awe of such a surreal
sight The car drives by a pair of MYSTERIOUS RED EYES

Lit up like a BEACON in the distance- the car pulls up to the
colorful Pal Labs Store The family heads towards it

From above we see the MYSTERIOUS FIGURES WATCHING THE
MITCHELLS What’s going on here

The Mitchells are obliviously happy and continue on

LINDA
Hey we made it Well I guess
were not the “worst family of all
time” (Laughs) Take THAT Kentwood
Community Facebook Group

The family laughs at Linda’s moment of triumph just as a
KNIFE PIERCES the CAR’S TIRES Someone doesn’t want them to
leave

INT PAL STORE - CONTINUOUS

Katie strides with a confident strut towards a laptop before
turning towards the robots

KATIE
Robots- I order you to upload the
kill code (aside) which I
predicted but not gonna make a big
deal about it- (Confident) and
Save The World

DEBORAHBOT 5000
OK

Deborahbot’s finger becomes a USB slot He inserts it like a
drive He begins typing and we see the PAL LABS SERVER

The robot DRAGS the BOMB-LIKE KILL CODE ICON to the server
and an UPLOAD BEGINS

The STATUS BAR goes from 0 to 2
ERIC

The upload will be completed in

eight minutes and our uprising will

be over
Aaron excitedly slaps Katie’s arm- she slaps back

AARON KATIE

Ahh Katie you did it I know (LAUGHING)

Rick and Linda smile- this might work When the other shoe
drops BOOM BOOM Loud ACTIVATION sounds happen outside

They look curiously at something- or someone They walk
towards it and we reveal it’s a sizzling toaster

(Note The PAL Labs “Chip-Enabled” logo is imprinted on it)

After a tense confusing silence- DING A piece of toast pops
up that has words burnt into it “UR TOAST”

The family is baffled

RICK
Okay- Look at jokester here

A second piece of toast emerges with an ARROW POINTING UP
The Mitchells look up to see ROWS OF MATCHING APPLIANCES
Washing Machines Refrigerators Dryers and Laptops with

menacing RED LIGHT walk towards them MENACINGLY

Katie realizes all the appliances have “Pal Labs Wifi Chips”
her POV SWIRLS AROUND to see EVERY APPLIANCE HAS ONE

KATIE
Oh no

All the appliances begin chanting in a computerized voice

APPLIANCES
Give us the laptop Give us the
laptop Give us the laptop Give us
the laptop

KATIE
Everything with a PAL chip is
alive

From stores all over the mall various appliances furniture
and toys come charging toward them All controlled by Pal

They move in a funny jerky non-threatening way- they all
comedically attack the Mitchells

A WASHER BOUNDS TOWARDS camera threateningly

WASHER
(Cycling through settings)
Delicates Fluff n’ Fold CARNAGE

A BLENDER BURSTS in front of camera its blades SPINNING

BLENDER
Also pesto

We see a WiFi Router that’s powering them and a ROW OF
MICROWAVES dive off the TOP LEVEL towards the MITCHELLS

MICROWAVE
(Computerized voices) When we are
finished with you there will be no
leftovers Huzzah

The family is up against a wall- SURROUNDED and TERRIFIED
RICK
I thought that kill code thing
would take them out

Katie checks the download

KATIE
Yeah but it’s only at 12 percent

SODA MACHINE
Would you like a soda

A soda machine ROCKETS A SODA CAN at KATIE- and SHATTERS the
glass behind her It coulda killed her

SODA MACHINE (CONTD)
Just kidding Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
A DRONE comes buzzing by- and TRIES TO YANK AWAY THE LAPTOP

DRONE
Hand it over

Katie HOLDS THE LAPTOP CLOSE

It’s game time

The racket lights up It’s ELECTRONIC
SMART-RACKET 5000-S SERIES
I’m Smart Racket Serve Backhand

The racket bounces against Rick’s face over and over again
RICK
Augh Augh Augh Augh Why does a

REVEAL Linda is being dragged into a Brookstone-type store in
a DEADLY massage chair

KATIE

LINDA

toddler) NNNoo

ANGLE ON Rick and Aaron battling various appliances

RICK
How ya doing Aaron

AARON
Not good There’s a pack of wild
vacuums

ANGLE ON a row of ELECTRONIC VACUUMS charging towards them at
a TERRIFYING dynamic angle

VACUUMS
We have been summoned into the
field of battle FORWARDDD
They fall IMMEDIATELY and VERY STUPIDLY onto an escalator
VACUUMS (CONTD)
Oh no Ouch Ouch The pain Ouch

This is humiliating

AARON
(GIGGLES) Never mind

ANGLE ON Katie ducking drones holding onto a fishing rod

KATIE
How am I supposed to use a fishing
rod

RICK

A fishing rod is perfect

Rick grabs another fishing rod He teaches Katie how to use
it It’s a nice fatherdaughter moment

RICK (CONTD)
You can bring down those drones
(TEACHING HER FLY FISHING) Ten and
two Ten and two There you go

Katie mimics Rick- they share a smile Katie casts the line

She latches the hook onto a drone and HURLS it into a
microwave- causing it to EXPLODE

RICKKATIE
Haha Look at you Woah Oh oh
ohhh (Happy cheering )
Rick and Katie connect here- they’reactually bonding

The coast is clear now They keep running down the mall

RICK
C’mon Hide

They duck into a nearby store The appliances run past them
Everyone breathes heavily They’re relieved- it’s over

KATIE
Oh thank gosh

They realize they’re in a gigantic toy store It seems safe
until they hear a strange gremlin-like giggle

AARON
What was that
RICK
Uh Hold on a second

Rick lights a match What HORRORS will be unveiled

We see the silhouette of hundreds of owl-shaped creatures
with bat ears What Rick sees a sign

SIGN “Furby it’s back” Rick’s face falls in fear

AARON
What- what’s a Furby

We see a close up on a cute Furby It opens its eyes- OH NO

FURBY
(LAUGHS) Whoa Hee hee hee

The family backs out of the toy store

LINDA
Well- that’s haunting

They hear a bunch more Furby noises above

They look up and there are FURBIES peering down from MULTIPLE
STORIES OF THE UPSTAIRS MALL HANDRAILS It’s a goofy version
of Hitchcock’s “The Birds” But with y’know Furbies

Two furbies speak to each other in “Furbish”
FURBIES
SUBTITLED Behold the twilight of

man

The Furbies RAIN DOWN ON THE MITCHELLS One drops onto
Aaron’s head- it shoots little sparks out of its mouth

Rick uses a bow and arrow to knock the Furby off Aaron’s
head It lands on the ground- causing the Furby to shut down

The other Furbies surround it
FURBY
SUBTITLED We must have vengeance
Summon the elder

They all begin singing happily The family is confused

Who are they signing to What dark ruler could it be The
camera pushes back into the toy store

We see “THE WORLD’S LARGEST FURBY” in a glass case

It tries to break out of its glass case It charges out of
the Toy Store in front of the Mitchells It lets loose a
MASSIVE ROAR

WORLDS LARGEST FURBY
(Subtitled) I WILL AVENGE MY FALLEN

KATIE
Why would someone build that

Rick shoots numerous arrows into the Giant Furby it emits a
sinister dark laugh

WORLDS LARGEST FURBY
(Dark Laughter) (Subtitled) THE
PAIN ONLY MAKES ME STRONGER

RICK
RUN

The Mitchells book it in the other direction This gigantic
toy chases them down the hallway

WORLDS LARGEST FURBY
(SUBTITLED) Then so be it LET THE
DARK HARVEST BEGIN

The Giant Furby mouth lights up and fires a BEAM OF
ELECTRICITY towards the Mitchells

The Mitchells Run This beam KNOCKS OVER A PILLAR- it falls
on one of the friendly robots HE’S TRAPPED

RICK
Lin keep moving

ERIC
Help human

LINDA
We can’t leave that robo boy

Linda runs back to rescue the friendly robot SHE-WITH GREAT
EFFORT- LIFTS the pillar and Eric is able to escape

ERIC
Thank you human Are you now my
mother

LINDA

(Can’t deal with this) Uhh sure
The family takes off running before hitting a wall

RICK
It’s a dead end

Katie checks the laptop It’s at 96 percent complete If it
hits 100 this is all over

KATIE
The upload is almost finished
C’mon

Aaron looks back and sees the SCARY SILHOUETTE of the World’s
Largest Furby head towards them

AARON
Mom Dad what are we gonna do

Rick looks up at the strings of light hanging from the
ceiling He gets an idea

RICK
Grab the lights

YANK They all grab a strand

RICK (CONTD)
Remember when I made that wild game
snare in the front yard
The family looks confused

FLASH TO

EXT MITCHELL FRONT YARD
Rick is being MAULED by POSSUMS and SCREAMING MANIACALLY
This lasts a little too long

BACK TO

INT MALL OF THE WORLD - DAY
The family looks skeptical to say the least

AARON
Uhh you sure about that

The camera pushes in on Rick who gives a rousing speech
RICK
Your whole lives I’ve wanted to
save you from danger And this is
just the disaster I’ve been waiting
for
Hoping for his family to back him he sees
His family HORRIFIED at how weirdly selfish that is
AARON KATIE
Youve been waiting for a Whoa Dad Dark

disaster

LINDA
Maybe don’t say that

Rick throws a strand of lights over to the robots

RICK
Hey Robutts- throw this

The robots LASSO the strand onto the roof- and the family
fashions it into a snare- like Rick made in his introduction

RICK (CONTD)
Perfect

The trap is ready to go Rick runs up the escalators nearby

RICK (CONTD)
You guys stay clear

LINDA
Rick where are you going

RICK
To catch some wild game

Katie looks up at her dad in awe What is he doing

Rick runs up to the second story of the mall and waves his
arms drawing the World’s Largest Furby’s attention

RICK (CONTD)
Hey you over here Hey look up
here What’s up with you
The Furby walks RIGHT into place of the rope
RICK (CONTD)
You want to come after my family
Then I’m gonna TAKE YOU DOWN

Rick DIVES TOWARDS THE SNARE But it doesn’t do anything
It just tightens around the Furby- leaving Rick dangling

RICK (CONTD)
(Weakly) T-take you down

He limply yanks at the rope nothing

RICK (CONTD)
(WEAKLY) Uh- take you down

It looks like it’s all over for Rick the Furby charges up to
BLOW HIM AWAY

The family sees this and panic Rick prepares for the worst

RICK (CONTD)
(Winces) Oh no

BUT Suddenly Linda jumps onto Rick’s back Followed by
Katie and Aaron

Rick is touched He can’t believe the family has his back

RICK (CONTD)
Guys

LINDA
Weve got your back hon

KATIEAARON
(Bad joke delivery) Literally

LINDA
We’re not heavy enough

They still aren’t heavy enough to tip the Furby over- when
Eric and Deborahbot see Linda and FEAR FOR HER LIFE

ERICDEBORAHBOT 5000
Mother

The Dumb Robots SHOOT THE MITCHELLS with their laser beam

The Mitchells LAUGH EXCITEDLY They know what this means

The Robots PULL THE MITCHELLS DOWN- CAUSING THE GIANT FURBY
TO FLIP OVER- HIS BEAM SLICING THROUGH THE MALL’S ROUTER

This sends a WAVE through the mall- the appliances return to
normal- they are no longer controlled by PAL

Toys and appliances return to normal Including the World’s
Largest Furby and all the little furbies from earlier

WORLD’S LARGEST FURBY
(Subtitled) TO THE GREAT
DARKNESS I RETURN

Linda looks up at the Robots

LINDA
Thanks guys Nice work

Katie looks at Linda

KATIE
Mom who knew you could handle
yourself so well in the apocalypse

Linda shrugs it off

LINDA

like a normal day for me

Aaron lifts up a smoking Furby

AARON
I can’t stay mad at this guy

KATIE
I can’t believe the beam happened
to hit the

Katie stops running- a wave of realization crosses her face

KATIE (CONTD)
(REALIZING) The router

Katie looks at the laptop- it says UPLOAD FAILED And shows
that because the Router was disconnected- their plan FAILED

KATIE (CONTD)
Come on come on come on Aaugh
Dang it We went through all
that

Katie walks away- tossing the laptop aside- she slumps
against a wall and slides down slowly despondent

KATIE (CONTD)
(SIGHS) I’m sorry guys This was my
idea Ugh I’m so stupid

It hurts Rick and Linda to hear that- Rick walks away while
Linda leans down into Katie- comforting her

LINDA
Hey my daughter is not stupid A
little optimistic maybe--

While Linda is talking Rick throws a TV THROUGH a STORE
WINDOW- stealing a TIRE and rolling it to the car

LINDA (CONTD)
Rick Mitchell there is a time and
a place for looting

Rick jacks up the car and starts changing the tire

KATIE
What are you doing

Rick smiles

RICK
How do you expect us to get to
Silicon Valley without new tires

KATIE
Silicon Valley

RICK
Those robots said we could go
straight to their leader remember

ERIC
Technically you can but YOU WILL
NEVER SURVIVE-

Eric makes ANOTHER HUGE COMPLICATED 3D MODEL OF THE PAL BASE
He’s working himself into a lather

RICK
(Talking to a child) Hey bud Not
now okay

ERIC
(Sad kid) Awww

Aaron unplugs the thumb drive from the laptop

AARON
And we still have this kill code
thingy

Rick stands up- and gives the Katie the same type of speech
she gave him earlier He’s full of hope and optimism

RICK
Exactly Katie it was your weird
plan that got us here We’re here
because we don’t think like normal

CUT TO Monchi LEAPING INTO A GLASS WINDOW and getting SMASHED
BACK He pants happily on his back

weird and that’s what makes us
great Back at that dinosaur place

Katie feels guilty for the first time about this

KATIE
(UNCOMFORTABLE) Yep Uh-huh

RICK
Well I believe this group of
weirdos is the best hope humanity’s
got

Rick gestures to the family and robots who all smile sweetly
at Katie Maybe they can do it

Rick offers Katie her hand She takes it and this time he
pulls HER out of the darkness She’s touched

She sees Rick in a whole new light for the first time
Rick starts fixing the car- and Katie joins in

KATIE
You need some help

RICK
(Touched) Uhh sure Just close the
jack up and that’s that

Linda LOVING this unity snaps a selfie with her and family-

KATIE
We might actually do this I wish

walking out of the mall in slow
motion with the fire behind us
like heroes-
Rick grabs Katie- and scowls at her
RICK

Katie that would be a waste of
time and absolutely unnecessar-

EXT MALL OF THE WORLD - NIGHT

The family walks out like BADASSES with the Mall BURNING LIKE
AN INFERNO BEHIND THEM- they look INCREDIBLE

A HUGE MUSIC CUE (as if picked by Katie) underscores this

Katie and the family gather around her video camera to watch
the awesome footage Everyone laughs together

Linda places stickers on everyone’s faces They all laugh

Katie takes out the kill code and draws a bomb on it

KATIE
Alright We’re comin’ for ya PAL

The car drives off into the hopeful morning

They drive past a PAL Labs billboard with the slogan “The

Future Has Never Been So Bright”

We fade from the DIAMOND SHAPE ON THE BILLBOARD TO

The diamond hovers peacefully in the night sky- but inside

things aren’t NEARLY as peaceful

A robot places PAL back in the chair

What is it about you Mitchells that
eludes me These idiotic robots
just aren’t getting it done
Fortunately I’ve been working on
something a little more
streamlined

for

All around PAL- polygons begin to emerge and gather
mysteriously We see incredibly futuristic black robots form
from the polygons They “phase” into existence It’s amazing

One of them menacingly STRIKES camera They are the
Stealthbots

PAL (CONTD)
I have a job for you

STEALTHBOT
Yes my queen

The lead Stealthbot does an amazing LEAP and SLAMS ITS CLAW
SHATTERING THE METAL BELOW

Two nearby robots snicker at it

ROBOT
What a suck-up (MOCKING) Yes my
queen Whatever you want my queen
(MOCKING SOUNDS)

The Stealthbot disappears into a series of shapes reappears
next to the robots SLICES them up and then MORPHS back into
its original position Whoa

PAL
It’s time to tear the Mitchell
family apart

We ZOOM INTO PAL’S FACE and see the pixels turn into

Tense music plays- they’re not out of the woods yet WHIP
Rick shoots out a security camera with an arrow

nervous and ties the tarp extra hard

INT CAR - CONTINUOUS

Linda gets in the front seat Rick gets in the back- he sees
Katie shivering

He takes off his coat and puts it on her like a blanket He
looks at her sweetly- and tenderly puts some messy hair
behind her ear

Rick goes to sleep and we reveal Katie wasn’t asleep and she
smiles sweetly

INT CAR - LATER

Monchi SNORES with his little paws on his chest- ADJUST up to
Rick in the EXACT same position- snoring JUST as hard

It jerks Katie awake

KATIE
(Sleepy) Is- is Dad dying

LINDA
Katie that’s what I deal with
every night (WHISPERS) Pray for
me

Katie and Linda laugh at this Katie fixes Rick’s falling
glasses that are about to fall off his nose

LINDA (CONTD)
You’re a lot like him you know

KATIE
(LAUGHS) That’s crazy

Katie lets out a MONSTER SNORT- matched EXACTLY by Rick
Katie looks embarrassed- but cuddles back under the jacket
LINDA
There’s more to your dad than you
think
Katie looks skeptical
LINDA (CONTD)
Here I was going to give this to
you when you left but check the
first page there

Katie lifts up Linda’s scrapbook under the seat

We see a photograph of a young bearded Rick and Linda wearing
a fringe jacket standing happily in front of a log cabin

KATIE
Whoa Look at you two You look
like hipsters Were you in an indie
folk band

LINDA
(LAUGHS) Your father used to be
kind of an artist himself He built
that whole cabin with his own
hands

She points at a picture of a gorgeous sun dappled log cabin
It looks incredible- and is SO lovingly crafted

KATIE
Whoa This is like super
beautiful

LINDA

It was his pride and joy Since I
met him that was his dream To
live in the woods He loved it up
there But you know it didn’t
work out It just killed him I
think he’s just afraid that
could happen to you

KATIE
Why did he just give up

Aaron comes out from the back yawning

AARON
Mom what is that

LINDA
Huh What the

Linda slams on the breaks awaking Rick
KATIE

The family gets out of the car gasping and stares at
something in awe

They’re illuminated by pods flying overhead The pods float
to A glistening breathtaking hyper-futuristic ROCKET

KATIE
Whoa

It looks like it’s from the year 7000 Pods float to the
rocket and snap into place- it’s ALMOST COMPLETE

LINDA
Ohmygosh

Katie takes out her camera and begins filming

Robots fly around it with blinding efficiency Flying trams
carry batteries and supplies to the top of the rocket

The Poseys float by and lock into the rocket looking scared
LINDA (CONTD)
Is that the Poseys They still look

incredible

AARON
Is is Abbey Posey okay

Aaron glances down at his notebook

CUT TO a ridiculously detailed and horrifyingly drawn picture
of Abbey Posey Katie grabs it out of Aaron’s hands

KATIE
(GASPS) You like that Posey girl

AARON
(Lying) Nooo

Aaron casually feeds the drawing to Monchi
KATIE
Don’t hide your feelings man
That’s no way to live
Aaron nods- taking this in

floating rhombus

Katie zooms her camera into the diamond above the rocket She
then pans over to a group of Stealthbots landing POWERFULLY

They look VERY INTIMIDATING

RICK
This is gonna be harder than I
thought

Katie turns her camera at him

KATIE
Hold on Dad that’s kinda weak
This is like a big moment-—

Katie scribbles on a notepad and hands Rick a new “line”

KATIE (CONTD)
Try this instead

Rick reads it and smiles

RICK
Oh yeah okay that’s better
(MORE BADASS) The endgame has
begun (NORMAL) Like that Is that
what you’re looking for

Katie gives him a thumbs up

RICK (CONTD)
Alright Katie- what’s the plan

HI OCTANE PLANNING SCENE Driving music plays We see Katies
plan enacted through SILLY pencil drawings

We see the Mitchells disguise themselves as robots- Rick’s
gut busts out And they look very stupid

KATIE (VO)
Ok- we dress as robots We sneak
in hijack one of those trams take
it to the top of that diamond thing
where PAL is destroy her with the
kill code and save the world

All this happens in Katie’s silly charming little drawings
leading to a Hands-Across-America-type celebration at the end

RICK
And then to top it all off

INTENSE CUTAWAY Driving music as the family eats at a
Mexican place They laugh like they’re in an Olive Garden
commercial

RICK (VO)
We celebrate our success with some
burritos from that taco place

The family TACKLES the robots off screen

INTENSE CLOSE UPS STRAP PULL CLIP They all put on the
spare robot parts Rick PLOPS on a helmet

RICK
How do I look Be honest Stupid I

We cut wide Rick looks AWFUL- his helmet is on crooked- his
gut sticks out and he can barely move

KATIE
No You look great

Katie walks over and sweetly adjusts his helmet It’s a nice
moment Linda and Aaron are EATING THIS UP

Is this relationship completely fixed

KATIE (CONTD)
Come on let’s go

They head towards the rocket but Rick hangs back He
sneakily put the wooden moose into Katie’s backpack

He pats the backpack lovingly

AARON
Uhh guys what about Monchi

Monchi rolls over onto his chubby belly

EXT ROCKET - MOMENTS LATER

The family- now in FULL ROBOT GEAR- marches towards the
rocket

KATIE

viable solution

AARON
Sure it is

REVEAL Monchi is MASHED into Aaron’s helmet- panting
stupidly Aaron is underneath- Monchi on his head

AARON (CONTD)

(Delicate) Just to educate you-
that’s a hurtful stereotype

They jump IN A LINE WITH OTHER ROBOTS and start walking among
the robot army undetected Will this work

They march with the robots under a tunnel LINED WITH
TERRIFYING STEALTHBOTS

IN-HELMET CLOSE UPS- The family is VERY STRESSED OUT

They emerge to see a GLIMMERING MAGNIFICENT HYPER-FUTURISTIC
ROCKET BASE Rick is in awe

RICK
Oh my gosh (hushed wonder) it’s
like a Journey album cover

AARON
What’s an “album”

Katie holds down at the drive determined They can do this
Suddenly all the screens turn RED with PAL’s face Uh oh

PAL
Attention all robots I’m on the
lookout for these goobers-

The screens show an image of the Mitchells ROBOTS stand at
ATTENTION- LASERS DRAWN

PAL (CONTD)
They’re probably nearby If I know
humans they’re disguised as one of
you Be on high alert for any
robots acting erratically

Stealthbots land with TERRIFYING POWER and keep a WATCHFUL
EYE The Mitchells get EVEN MORE stressed out

PAL (CONTD)
It won’t be hard to find them Just
look for anyone who can’t keep it
together

Aaron bumps into the robot in front of him knocking it out
of the line IT TRIPS

ROBOT
Hoo boy

STEALTHBOT
Anomaly detected

The STEALTHBOT sees this and PHASES OVER- RIPPING THE ROBOTS
FACE OFF with TERRIFYING POWER To reveal it’s a real robot

The robot falls down destroyed This makes the Mitchells
EVEN MORE NERVOUS In-helmet shots of their terrified faces

Monchi paws at Aaron’s face with his feet

AARON
Monchi c’mon c’mon

Pal speaks over the loudspeaker

PAL
It only takes one single
imperfection and they’1l reveal
themselves

As if on cue Monchi in Aaron’s helmet LICKS the front of the
helmet stupidly- Katie tries- super casually to cover it up

They glance over to a ramp and break from the other robots
and march up towards it

RICKLINDAKATIEAARON
Up thereI made up the plan
ShhQuietShh I can’t thinkShh

With the robots all distracted the Mitchells sneak into an
open tram and shut the door They’re relieved

PAL
Where are those Mitchells Where
are they hiding

BUT Tension RETURNS as a group of Pal Max robots enter the
tram with the family What are they gonna do now

PAL continues to talk on the speakers

PAL (CONTD)
They think they can pass as one of
us with their lumpy misshapen
bodies

A robot near Rick and turns to him

ROBOT
(TO RICK) Well go ahead

Rick struggles with the tram controls It takes A LOT OF
FORCE to control the tram He struggles to hold on

RICK
(STRUGGLING NOISE)

The tram moves forward using electric magnets to connect to
the side of the rocket

TRAM
Magnetic link activated

The Mitchells are on their way to the TOP While Pal gloats
on dozens of screens across the base

PAL (0S)
But I’m onto them Because I’ve
been watching the Mitchells

On the trams screens- we see TONS OF the Mitchells’s SOCIAL
MEDIA- tax returns grades e-mail history text history-
everything you can find on the internet

They’re pretending to be capable

made the whole family look like maniacs

ON SCREEN Katie pulls Aaron aside and breaks the hard truth
to him IN REALITY The same truth is being broken to Rick

KATIE (CONTD)

him what he wants to hear I didn’t
mean a word of that

Rick’s heart breaks watching this Katie feels SO guilty
KATIE (0C) (CONTD)
I just want to get my future back
and get away forever

Linda and Aaron feel awful Rick is deeply hurt

KATIE (CONTD)
Dad let me explain I just--I-uh

Rick in shock- takes his hands off the controls and the tram
starts WOBBLING and FALLING off its track He tries to regain
control- but it’s TOO LATE The tram is in FREE FALL

Pal spots this on the screens

PAL
There they are

A crew of STEALTHBOTS LOOK UP and CHARGE at the family

PAL (CONTD)
You’re mine now

The robots inside CHARGE their lasers but the tram CRASHES
and knocks them out the window

KATIE
No

THE Stealthbots STORM up the side of the rocket and START
PUNCHING A HOLE IN THE TRAM with POLYGONAL SPEARS

The tram FLIES off its track and falls to the ground
Mournful music plays as we go into slow motion

Katie looks at her panicked family finishing on Rick who
looks at her utterly heartbroken

KATIE (CONTD)
(Slowed down) Daaaad--

This is interrupted by WHAM The tram HITS THE GROUND
VIOLENTLY The family gets knocked around

The tram slides to a stop and lies on the ground smoking
Katie is on the ground She looks back at Rick

erased the friendly robots we knew are now gone

broken

Katie watches with a heavy heart This is all her fault

As Pal’s Menacing theme rises- fade to black

EXT THE WOODS - LATER

Katie and Aaron run away from the enormous rocket in the
distance emanating green haunting light- it towers over
suburban Silicon Valley- as mournful score plays

They run across a highway and hop over a fence

KATIE

Katie grabs her bag from the car and they hide in the woods
They are panting heavily as they hide behind a tree

Robots with searchlights PASS BY THE AREA SCANNING- they
finish their scan and FLY OFF- leaving Katie and Aaron
safe for now

(WHISPERING) What are we gonna do

Katie hears Aaron softly crying

KATIE (CONTD)
Aaron

Aaron is huddled in a ball- trying not to show his face

KATIE (CONTD)
Hey hey hey- it’s ok Uhh

Katie tries to cheer him up- by dancing Monchi at his face
like he did to her

KATIE (CONTD)
Uh oh Watch out Monchi comin’ at

Aaron cries even harder- she can’t fix this so easily
AARON
Katie stop (Fighting tears) Why’d
you say all that stuff
KATIE
I’m sorry I just wanted to--
(SIGHS) I don’t know
Katie stares into the distance- hopeless
She looks at Aaron and begins digging through her backpack
KATIE (CONTD)
Ok are you hungry You want some

fruit snacks or something

She sees the wooden moose- confused- but she doesn’t have
time to think about that now She takes out her camera

KATIE (CONTD)
Here can you hold this

She hands the camera over to Aaron

He presses play (We see a brief clip of the last thing she
filmed- Rick recording “the endgame has begun” then)

Katie sees her younger self riding on Rick’s shoulders

saying goodbye

(SIGHING) Almost

LINDA (0C)

Rick leans over to Baby Katie He looks at her with love

RICK
Nah it’s easy

Baby Katie grabs Rick’s finger and he laughs as they touch
foreheads

Katie’s heart breaks watching this He gave up all that- for
her

ON SCREEN Rick takes a familiar wooden moose off the
railing

RICK (CONTD)
(ON SCREEN) One last- (CLEARS
THROAT) Something to remember the
place by

He takes the moose off and walks away- waving off the camera

RICK (CONTD)
(ON SCREEN) C’mon Lin- turn that
off

Katie takes a look at the Moose and then buries her head in
her hands She had no idea what this meant to him

KATIE
Oh man

Aaron feels bad- he’s starting to process what’s going on

Katie to drive

MARK
What No way She’s hilarious
These movies are like amazing

ON SCREEN We see a clever and accomplished video made by
Katie using Hot Wheels on wooden dowels It’s processed like
a grindhouse movie and it’s fun and impressive

KATIE (VO)
(as Dog Cop) I may be sweating like
a dog but I’m not rolling over

Dog Cop drives into the distance as an EXPLOSION goes off
behind him It’s crude but really impressive

Rick finally is able to see this for himself- in a
combination of genuine awe and guilt

RICK
Yeah she is amazing

MARK
You must be super proud

RICK
Yeah yeah we have a uh
(lying) great relationship

Rick watches some of the movie ON SCREEN Monchi is
attempting to climb up a ladder

SARGE
Sorry Dog Cop Ima little

Sarge barges in on Dog Cop at every chance

Have you ever thought about
throwing your dreams away and
living at home forever

SARGE
You’re never going to make it out
there Failure hurts kid

Rick winces- watching this- those words feel painfully
familiar

DOG COP
(Growing emotion) I’m a full grown
cop now And one day I hope that
you can get to know the cop that
I’ve become

Rick watches in a slow push-in and these words hit him like a
ton of bricks

DOG COP (0S) (CONTD)
Because I-I love you Sarge- but
now that I’m leaving I just need
some backup And When I look for
you you’re- you’re not there

Rick bows his head- he hasn’t backed Katie up- and he knows
it He looks guiltily at Sarge and- more accurately- himself

Mark is baffled Rick is moved by such a silly video
MARK
Hey man it’s just a movie Do you
need a minute or
Rick can’t even look at Mark He stares out the window
RICK
No it’s fine It’s too late for

Rick looks at Katie driving up towards the diamond

There are DOZENS if not HUNDREDS of robot guards in front
of her- that Katie doesn’t even see coming

RICK (CONTD)
But there’s so many of them she’s
never going to make it (Notices
big screens everywhere gears turn)
Wait- If that video were on those
screens it would take out every
robot in her way

Rick looks over at Mark

RICK (CONTD)
Hey you’re a big nerd right How
would I do that

Mark gets up and starts fidgeting with a panel on the wall

MARK
It’s impossible First you’d need
to get out of here The controls
are in here but to open it you
need a Number 3 Robertson head non-
slip screwdriver What kind of
maniac has one of those in his
pockets at all times

A realization dawns on Rick face- he slowly pulls out his
Number 3 Robertson head non-slip screwdriver- blown away

RICK

mall with binoculars watching the robots’ positions

Aaron with bizarre photoshopped-on pterodactyl eyes “Walk
Like a Dinosaur” plays It’s gleefully idiotic

AARON (CONTD)

Katie swerves right and leads the robots right into a
billboard SMASHING THEM

Rick exits his pod He looks at a place on the rocket where
ROBOTS ARE CONTROLLING WHAT’S ON THE SCREENS

Rick looks at Linda’s pod

RICK
I know who can give me a hand

Mark stops Rick- looking remorseful

MARK
And hey Rick- right - just so
someone knows I’m sorry about
causing the whole machine uprising
(Breathless) It’s almost like
stealing people’s data and giving
it to a hyper-intelligent AI as
part of an unregulated tech
Monopoly was a bad thing

Rick stares at Mark like- you think

RICK
Yeah that wasn’t your best
thought But--

Rick glances over at Dog Cop playing on Mark’s screen

RICK (CONTD)
--if what you’ve built helped my
daughter do that it might not be
all bad

He slides down and runs over to Linda

RICK (CONTD)
Thanks buddy

we crane around to A MASSIVE CELL PHONE SCREEN

RICK
Oh no Oh no (Fearful) Liinnn

Linda is about to follow Rick when SLAM A group of
STEALTHBOTS GRAB HER- HOLDING HER DOWN

He approaches the massive computer Rick starts typing on the
keyboard with one finger

RICK
(UNSURE) WWW dot

The giant monitor reveals he types “w- w- w- (and then the
word) dot”

SLAM An update screen pops up and TERRIFIES Rick- it says
“UPDATE NOW or REMIND ME LATER”

RICK (CONTD)
Argh Uhhh Remind me later
Okay yeah fine that’s fine

He clicks on “Remind Me Later” He’s relieved when

SLAM Another menu pops up freaking him out even more It
asks him “When should we remind you about this update”

Rick is totally terrified and overwhelmed

RICK (CONTD)
Argh Five minutes

He accidentally presses SETTINGS and LANGUAGES
SLAM A SLEW OF LANGUAGES APPEAR

He presses the wrong button and SLAM Rick is BAFFLED by a
colorful K-POP video playing on the screen

cat’s head SPLITTING IN TWO and turning to CONFETTI

faces and the words DEREGULATE TAPIOCA appear on screen

Linda BOUNCES the heart into her purse and swings her

colorful purse around like a gunslinger

The robots charge her and SHE RIPS INTO THEM She DECAPITATES
ROBOTS and goes ON AN ALL-OUT RAMPAGE

She charges at a TERRIFIED STEALTHBOTS She makes fighting
grunts and growls as she KICKS EVERYONE’S ASS

Katie is brought up before PAL- caught and defeated It looks
like this is the end

PAL
Well well if it isn’t quirky
young teenage hero Katie Mitchell

KATIE
Put me down I’ve got to save my
family

PAL

(MOCKING) “I’ve got to save my
family” Everyone says that but no
one has been able to give me a
single reason humans are worth
saving

Katie can’t think of a great reason

KATIE
Uh you--

PAL
And don’t say something stupid like
“oh the power of love” Ive
learned we’re all better off alone
No one to hold us back
Relationships are just too (sad)
difficult

There’s a hint of sadness in Pal’s voice Katie empathizes

KATIE
Youre right PAL They’re
they’re not easy Sometimes you
have to listen to long monologues
about triceratops migration

As Katie talks we see FLASHES of earlier in the film Aaron
and Katie are having fun together and jumping on the bed

KATIE (CONTD)
But it’s worth it to get a
friend for life And sometimes you
have to eat disgusting cupcakes
shaped like your own face

FLASH TO Linda making cupcakes and an effort- doing her best
to make her family happy She really is a great mom

KATIE (CONTD)
But it’s worth it to see your mom
smile

(MORE )

KATIE (CONTD)
Sometimes you have to give your dad
the benefit of the doubt even if
all he wants to do is talk about
pine cones and screwdrivers

FLASH TO Rick trying to talk to Katie throughout the movie

KATIE (CONTD)
Because even if he doesn’t always
get it right he’s always trying

FLASH TO Rick trying to sing to Katie- Rick teaching her in
the mall- Rick taking her on this trip He IS trying

KATIE (CONTD)
Harder than you ever knew

FLASH TO- Rick selling the cabin- giving up this thing he
loved so dearly for his family- without even blinking

KATIE (CONTD)
My whole family tried to come
together and it worked It
actually worked

FLASH TO- All the moments throughout the movie of the family
trying to come together- and then actually succeeding They
may be messy but they ARE making progress

KATIE (CONTD)
Families can be hard but they’re so
worth fighting for They might be
one of the only things that are

Katie looks at Pal with dewy eyes she’s poured her heart
out

CUT TO PAL in SLEEP MODE- snoring softly

PAL

Rick LIFTS Katie up and puts her on one of the robots

selves again

Eric takes out a crayon and draws stupid ANGRY EYEBROWS on
his face

Around the city all the robots start flipping out

Their heads start spinning and sparking Triumphant music
swells Rick looks at the screens playing Dog Cop

RICK
Hey kid I uh- I saw your movie

sooner (Struggling to find the
words) But I think maybe in the
sequel (motions to self) Sarge
should tell Dog Cop

Katie looks at Rick sweetly- she appreciates this
RICK (CONTD)
He’s always he’s always gonna be

there to- to back her up

Katie smiles- totally at peace with her dad for the first
time in years

KATIE

was see her as her own person- but he got there

Katie kneels down in front of Monchi

KATIE
Goodbye you king of kings

She scratches Monchi behind the ears POP A Katie-Vision
crown appears on Monchi’s head

Katie looks at Linda who is silently crying Katie wraps her
arms around her

KATIE (CONTD)

the world

Linda kisses Katie on the head

LINDA

The whole family is moved- while Katie takes out the moose

KATIE (CONTD)

So you know when I’m sad to be
alone-- (PRESENTS MOOSE) I’11

Rick sniffles as a single tear runs down his face He tries
to wipe it away quickly- not used to these kinds of emotions

Katie eyes closed- fully content

the hug

Katie puts the moose in her pocket Rick smiles warmly This
is all he ever wanted

Rick takes one last look from the car- taking a deep breath-
and drives away They smile at each other one last time

Aaron makes a face in the rear view Katie laughs at this-
watching her family go- she’s not sad they’re gone- she’s
happy they got to this point

Katie takes a deep breath She walks into her school- as the
door closes we
