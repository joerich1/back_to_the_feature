The father walks into the house and Vicky and Juan Antonio
follow him

JUAN ANTONIO
He refuses to speak any other
language and that’s an important
point with my father actually

VICKY
Oh really It is Why

JUAN ANTONIO
Because he’s a poet and he writes
the most beautiful sentences in the
Spanish language but he -- I don’t
know -- he doesn’t believe that a
poet should pollute his words by
any other tongue which is quite a--

VICKY
Right right No it makes sense I
understand ‘cause of the
translation and the things you
might lose I mean I I took some
Spanish Of course I have no flair
for languages I read it much
better than I speak it

JUAN ANTONIO

the point

JUAN ANTONIO (cont’d)

VICKY

Juan Antonio and Vicky sit down on the wall

VICKY (contd)

father publish his poems

JUAN ANTONIO
Well because he hates the world
and that’s his way of getting back
at them -- to create beautiful
works and thento deny them to
the public which I think it’s

VICKY
My God Well what makes him
soangry toward the human race

JUAN ANTONIO
Mm because after thousands of
years of civilizationthey still
