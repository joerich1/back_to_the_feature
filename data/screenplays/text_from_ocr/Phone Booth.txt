PHONE BOOTH
by

Larry Cohen

FADE IN
NEW YORK CITY - AERIAL VIEW OF DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - DAY
MULTIPLE STREET SCENES - DAY

The sidewalks crowded as usual A sea of humanity People
come and go -- always in a hurry Oblivious of one another

A TRAFFIC JAM -- A STREET being torn up by construction
workers A SANITATION TRUCK loading up refuse VENDORS
PEDDLING nuts and salted pretzels PANHANDLERS blocking a
passerby Intimidating Demanding Almost mocking
Were surrounded by the teeming life of the city as weve

come to expect it -- complete with a cacophony of sound
MULTIPLE CUTS -- Phone kiosks and phone booths on the East
Side and West Side -- uptown and down

One frustrated caller has lost his money in the slot and he
takes it out on the equipment -- smashing the receiver
violently against the coin box until the instrument splinters
into a dozen pieces

NARRATOR
There are 237911 pay telephones in
the five burroughs of the city of
New York Many of them are still
in working order

DOZENS OF QUICK CUTS --

NEW YORKERS on the phone in extreme close up We dont hear
the words Only the facial expressions inform us that these
are human beings under tremendous pressure Life in the city
is wearing them down

MULTIPLE SHOTS - JUST MOUTHS

Lips jabbering into receivers Cross-cut against one
another

NARRATOR
Despite increased usage of cellular
devices an estimated four anda
half million New Yorkers and two
million visitors still utilize pay
telephones on a regular basis At
thirty-five cents a pop for the
first three minutes

ANGLE ON CORNER IN MID-MANHATTAN - DAY

Theres a phone booth situated on the southeast side of the
street

NARRATOR

Youre looking at the telephone
booth at the corner of 45th Street
and 8th Avenue in the heart of the
Manhattan theatrical district It
has been scheduled to be removed
and replaced by a kiosk Its one
of the few remaining phone booths
left in the city

CAMERA MOVES IN on the irate caller in the booth -- a very
well-dressed gray-haired lady -- totally conservative in
appearance

WOMAN IN BOOTH

(into receiver)
You have lied to me for the last
time you lowlife prick bastard I
dont ever want to hear the sound
of your fucking voice again

(listens)
Yes well fuck you too

She slams down the receiver and exits The booth remains
vacant for a brief interval

NARRATOR
At least three hundred calls daily
originate from this booth The
coins are collected twice a day
This booth has been burglarized
forty-one times in the last six
months

Someone is approaching the booth fishing in his pocket for
coins This is STUART SHEPARD snappily dressed his hair
styled and his nails manicured Here is a man who clearly
takes excellent care of himself He sports a Donna Karen
suit and silk Armani tie

Hes about to step into the booth when hes accosted by a
middle-aged man in a soiled apron whos run out of a nearby
restaurant and has finally caught up with him

MARIO
Stu we got to talk

STU
Wish I could accommodate you
Mario but this is my busy time of
day

MARIO
How come you cross the street every
time you go past the restaurant

STU
Why dont I stop in later for some
lunch
MARIO
Theres no more drinks or free
meals until the restaurant starts
showing up in the columns like you
said

STU
Im doing my level best for you
people

MARIO
One lousy mention in the Post and
you expect to eat for six months

STU
I got the food critic from the
Village Voice all lined up to give
you a review

MARIO
Thats what you tell me last July
And he never shows

STU
I was allowing you time to expand
the menu Wallpaper the bathrooms
for God sakes You get only one
shot with these fucking critics and
I dont want you to blow a rare
opportunity

MARIO
You the one blowing it How long
you think you can fuck everybody

STU
Hold on right there Ive gota
very excellent reputation around
this town

MARIO
So how come you take two nice suits
of clothes from Harry and never get
his daughter on David Letterman

STU
Hell Im not an agent Ima
publicist

MARIO
Mister youre nothing
STU
Believe me Valeries on the
waiting list to audition Harrys
got no complaints He just let me
pick out this tie the other day

MARIO
That Harrys a damn fool

STU
Mario please let me make this up
to you How about I arrange for
the opening night party for this
new off-Broadway show Im handling
-- to be held at your place with
local TV coverage on nine and
eleven I mean I had it promised
to another client -- who actually
pays me money But it isnt firmed
up yet And I could throw it your
way Maybe

MARIO
What is involved

STU
Youd toss in the buffet for say
seventy or eighty The producers
would supply their own vino of
course Id deliver you a
truckload of celebrities And if
they like the food theyll all
come back naturally

MARIO
What celebrities

STU
You want Liza Minelli An Oscar
winner Or Douglas Fairbanks Jr

MARIO
Is he still alive

STU
I saw him last night going into the
Four Seasons Ill bring you over

a whole VIP list when we come by
for dinner

MARIO
How come everybody wants to eat but
nobody wants to pay

STU
You cant think small like that
Hey you still feature musicians
Fridays and Saturdays

MARIO
At least they work for their meals

STU
What about Harrys daughter as an
extra added attraction Shell
belt out five or six showtunes --
two sets a night -- and it wont
cost you a fucking nickel

MARIO
How come

STU
Star Showcase Let me handle
setting that up And when she
eventually goes on Letterman
shell announce Im currently
appearing over at Marios fine
supper club Right over CBS shell
say that Mario

MARIO
Youre full of shit You know
that All bullshit

STU

Thats just a vulgar word for PR

(placing an arm around

him)
Mario you cant hurt my feelings
Even when I was a kid and they
hurled certain invectives my way
it never bothered me Other kids
would fall apart if anybody called
them a fucking name Me I just
loved the attention Shit-for-
brains -- thats what the bigger
kids named me And I answered to
it Hey shit-for brains
reporting for duty Everybody
loved me for that I could take
abuse After a while I kind of
wore them down There was nothing
more they could say to me So they
stopped I kind of missed it

MARIO
Im sorry I even talked to you

STU

Ill bet your loving wife put you
up to this She saw me pass by and
she sent you out in the street
But I dont hold it against you
personally -- you still serve up
superior veal chop

(entering phone booth)
Now I got urgent business to
conduct Mario

He slides the booth closed in Marios face

The frustrated restaurateur glares at him through the glass
before giving up and walking off -- talking to himself as he
goes up the block

INSIDE THE BOOTH Stu inserts his thirty-five cents and
dials

STU
Hello Mavis sweet creature

MAVIS VOICE
Where have you been Do you think
I have nothing to do but wait
around for you to call

STU
Im only a few minutes late
loveliest individual on earth

MAVIS VOICE
Stu Im so lonely When can I see
you

STU
Good news in that arena Kelly
goes into rehearsal as of Monday
You know how dedicated she is By
the time she gets back from dancing
her ass off she goes right to
sleep Well have both our days
and certain nights Not to mention
when they take the show on the
road
MAVIS VOICE
How long is that for

STU
Four to five weeks -- minimum

MAVIS VOICE
Maybe I should quit my job so we
can be together full time

STU
I wouldnt do that

MAVIS VOICE
Sometimes I think if I have to give
one more fucking manicure

STU
Thats how you met me

MAVIS VOICE
never saw a worse set of nails
Bit right down to the quick

STU
m much better groomed since
youve been looking after me

MAVIS VOICE
m glad you admit it

sTU
Even Kelly remarked on it when I
first met her

MAVIS VOICE
She could care less how you look
Shes only interested in pushing
her own career Some wife youre
stuck with

STU
The marriage is not without its
compensations Do you imagine I
could afford that apartment on what
Im earning Not with everybody
cutting back on the publicity Not
to mention a million college
graduates coming into the
profession trying to cut me out
And one thing you cant expect from
your clients is loyalty They get
a couple of bad notices they dump

you Goodbye

MAVIS VOICE
Dont go

sTU

I wasnt saying goodbye to you I
was saying how the clients try to

give you the wave off without even

a months notice

A conservative businessman now stands outside the booth
waiting to use it He deliberately glances at his watch a
few times to demonstrate his impatience

who slides the booth open a crack

sTU
(yelling)
What Is your watch busted Its
twenty after eleven and Im gonna
be occupied indefinitely with my
transaction So get out of my
face

STU
Sorry honey There will be no
further interruption

MAVIS VOICE
Why must you always be calling me
from some booth

STU
On account of that phone records
are regularly subpoenaed in divorce
proceedings And I dont want some
entry showing up on my cellular
bill either She gets the mail
She looks these items over
Sometimes she even dials up a
strange number to see who it is

MAVIS VOICE
Then she suspects something

STU
Its only because her last husband
the choreographer ran around on

This bothers Stu

He closes the booth up again and turns his back to the
gentleman who gives up and departs
her She cant get that out of her
head Thats how she caught onto
him The phone bills

MAVIS VOICE
She hasnt developed much skill at
holding a man

STU
You know what a self-fulfilling
prophecy is She was so sure I was
going to find me a woman that she
finally drove me back to you I
thought Id feel all guilty about
it -- but I guess it hasnt kicked
in yet

(beat)
Still I wouldnt do anything to
hurt her Basically Kellys a
decent individual

MAVIS VOICE
What about hurting me Like last
time

STU
Hurt You were glad to be rid of
me

MAVIS VOICE
For a while I was til I took
stock of what was around Youre
the lesser of many evils

STU
Thats about the nicest thing you
ever said

MAVIS VOICE
Tll have it engraved

STU
Weve been up front with each other
from the beginning Lets keep it
that way How about a drink Say
seven oclock The Monkey Bar

MAVIS VOICE
Meet me in front I dont like
walking in there unescorted

sTU
Yeah youre great enough looking
to be mistaken for one of those
thousand dollar a night girls

MAVIS VOICE
It happens all the time lately

STU
And wear that short black number I
bought you from Bendels

MAVIS VOICE
Again I dont know if its me or
that dress you like

STU
Have a good day Make plenty of
tips And leave the whole evening
open She thinks Ive got Knicks
tickets

He hangs up Then whips a tiny cellular phone out of his
jacket pocket flips it open and dials Someone answers on
the first ring

COLUMNIST (VO)
Speak

STU
(into cellular)
Its your boy Stuart When was the
last time I called you for a favor

COLUMNIST (VO)
The column is already full

STU
I just need one line Anybody you

Marios Stromboli restaurant

COLUMNIST (VO)
Maybe you dont hear so good I
got no space for you

sTU
Whos asking any favors Im
offering reciprocal information

COLUMNIST (VO)
Since when were you ever a reliable
source
He hangs up

STU
Check it out Tony award-winning
producer Willie Beagle tossed his
wife back into rehab again

diving off the terrace at their
plush eighteen room residence at
the San Remo I got it from the
doorman

COLUMNIST (VO)

you bother to read my shit

STU
Louis my intentions were entirely
honorable

COLUMNIST (VO)
ll drop your item in sometime
next week If you promise not to
call me for a month

and tucks it away

Then he starts to vacate the booth

rings

on the other end of the line

Curious he picks up the receiver

VOICE
Dont even think about leaving that
booth

STU
What

VOICE
Stay exactly where you are and
listen carefully

STU
Ive got a heavy day mister

VOICE
You know better than to disobey me

STU
I dont know you at all

Stu looks pleased as he folds the cell phone

The phone rings And

Theres a voice

A DISTINCTIVE MALE VOICE
VOICE
Are you absolutely sure

STU
Who is this

VOICE
Someone whos watching you

STU
Get lost

VOICE
Love the gray suit That red and
black tie makes a nice combination

Stu is taken back by the accurate description of his apparel
He looks around nervously

STU
Where Where are you

VOICE
Closer than you think

STU
I dont see you

VOICE
There are any number of windows
Check them out

Indeed that street corner is surrounded by high rise
buildings and hotels

STU
Okay you had your little joke

VOICE
Im not sufficiently amused Not
yet We have more to talk about

Stu knows he should simply hang up but something tells him
not to Perhaps its the strange tone of the mans voice

STU
Do me a favor Call up somebody
else

VOICE

But its you Im interested in
You know how many people use that
booth every day

STU
Why dont you tell me

VOICE
Better than two-hundred people on
average

STU
Is that what you do Count them

VOICE
What else do I have to do Its
interesting watching people
Trying to guess who they are And
what theyre up to

STU
What are you -- a shut-in of some
kind

VOICE

You might say that I cant go
out I might be seen

STU
Somebodys looking for you

VOICE
Desperately
STU
The cops
VOICE
Not yet
STU
The ex-wife Whatd you do -- run

out on child support

VOICE
What kind of man do you think I am

STU
Frankly I could care less You

VOICE
Its not in your best interests to
hang up on me That would make me
angry

STU
Isnt that just too bad

VOICE
For you

STU
Theres ten million names in the
phonebook Pester somebody else

fq

VOICE
never talk to people I cant see
need to study their reactions

STU
Alright bullshit artist what am

VOICE

Scratching your forehead with your
left hand Now youre brushing
your hair back

STU
Okay okay you got me in your
scrutiny So what

VOICE
So lets talk

STU
Only I got nothing to say

VOICE
Oh you will Youll do a lot of
talking before this conversation is
over And itll only end when I
want it to

STU
Is that a fact Well if you watch
closely you will see me hang up

VOICE
I dont think you will

sTU
Why not

VOICE
I interest you

STU
Why should I be interested in some
creep who gets his jollies spying
on strangers in phone booths

VOICE
But youre not a stranger Stu

The sound of his own name sends a chill through him

STU
Who put you up to this

VOICE
You were my very own selection

STU
Why me in particular

VOICE
Because youre so afraid

STU
Ha Whatve I got to be afraid of

STU
Just about everything You have so
much to hide

STU
How do you figure that

VOICE
Why else would a man with a
perfectly good cellular bother to
make calls from a pay booth

STU
Thats my business

VOICE
Ive made it mine

STU
All of a sudden Im required to
give explanations to you

VOICE
In explicit detail
STU
What is this Some kind of candid
camera gag Or like that thing on
HBO where the cab driver is taping
what goes on in the back seat

VOICE
This is not showbusiness my
friend This is reality

STU
Your reality Not mine you
lowlife fuck

VOICE
Stu youll be made to suffer for
your attitude so lets dispense
with the vulgarities

STU
Now youre threatening me Fuck

VOICE
Youre only making it easier for me
to do you harm

STU
Oh yeah Right Can you see how
Im trembling

VOICE
You will be

STU

threatening calls in a goddam phone
booth When are you going to start

VOICE

Stu

STU
You dont know anything about me

VOICE
Infinitely more than you know about
me

sTU
Like what

VOICE
Like the number you dialed when you
first entered the booth

STU
How would you know that

VOICE
Im watching through a scope and I
could clearly read the buttons you
pushed I have another extension
here by the window Shall I dial
that same number back for you
Would that convince you

Stu nervously cranes his neck looking around at all the tall
buildings that surround the street corner

STUS POV

PANNING up at thousands of windows The Voice could be
coming from anywhere

BACK TO STU IN THE BOOTH

VOICE
Lets see whos on the other end of
the line

STU
Dont

VOICE
Too late

(beat)

Its already ringing Ill hold
the receiver up so you can listen
in

Stu can hear the beeping as the other line rings

Then Mavis voice can be heard answering Stu listens
helplessly

MAVIS VOICE
Hello

VOICE
Well hello
MAVIS VOICE
Who is this

VOICE
Someone whos really tight with
your boyfriend -- who just called

you from his favorite phone booth

MAVIS VOICE
You know Stu

VOICE

thinks How he lies

MAVIS VOICE

He doesnt feel like talking

STU
(shouts)

Mavis Im afraid Stu hasnt been
totally honest with you But then

MAVIS VOICE
Whats your name To whom am I
speaking

VOICE
Youve never heard of me Mavis
He doesnt want you to know I

nutcase Hang the fuck up

VOICE
She doesnt want to She wants to

MAVIS VOICE
Did his wife put you up to this
That bitch Kelly

VOICE
Oh yes the bitch wife Kelly My
very next call

STU
(yells)
He doesnt know my wife Dont
tell him anything else

Outside the booth a huge heavy-set black woman in a too
tight dress now appears with the clear desire to use the
phone Her name is FELICIA She taps on the glass

FELICIA
Could you hurry it along

Stu ignores her and Felicia glares at him through the glass
with hostility

Stu has no inclination to deal with anybody else Hes too
distracted by the madness happening over the telephone

sTU
Can you hear me Mavis Keep your
big mouth shut

VOICE
Is that any way to talk to a woman
you love
(beat)
Mavis is he always that abusive to
you

MAVIS VOICE
Youre getting me all upset I
dont know who you are or how you
know all this --

VOICE
I find out things -- from watching
people and listening to them

MAVIS VOICE
Just what is your relationship to
Stu Thats all I want to know

VOICE
Well what do you think

MAVIS VOICE
Answer me goddam it

VOICE
Well alright Stu and I are --
longtime companions A pair Two
of a kind Closer than close
Peas in a pod Spoons in a drawer

MAVIS VOICE

all lies

VOICE

Too late Stu She already
believes it

MAVIS VOICE
You can tell that scumbag never to
bother me again

VOICE
He wont care Hell still have
me

STU

Its not true I do care

From outside the booth theres a louder rapping on the
glass Felicia really wants in

FELICIA
Get done in there mister I got
me an important call

STU
Go away

FELICIA
Shit I will Finish up

She continues to rap on the glass as Stu tries to focus on
the two-way phone call

VOICE
Why dont you tell me what you
think of us

MAVIS VOICE
Youre both disgusting

VOICE

Thats what he said about you
Well if Stu didnt have the balls
to come out and tell you the truth
I felt it was my responsibility to
clear the air Goodbye now Mavis
Thanks for your time

(the phone clicks off we

hear only a dial tone)
Back to you again Stu

STU
You total asshole How could you
do that

VOICE
Speaking of females that woman
hovering outside the booth -- may

as well tell her that youll be on
the line forever

STU
Like hell I will

VOICE
Im ready for you to take out your
cellular and phone home And this
time Ill listen in

STU
Theres no chance of that

VOICE
Or should I call Kelly and make up
something totally outrageous You
must realize by now I have a vivid
imagination

STU
You dont know our phone number

VOICE
Are you absolutely sure I may
have been watching you on a regular
basis Keeping track of all the
numbers I see you dial

STU
And Im supposed to believe that

VOICE
Ive put a great deal of
preparation into this -- prior to
actually saying hello Now do you
want to dial 832-7165 -- or should

I

The sound of the actual number being spoken shocks him even
more than the earlier mention of his name

STU
What are you going to tell her

VOICE
Youll do the talking

STU
What am I supposed to say

VOICE
Try telling her the truth

STU
Look I dont want to hurt Kelly
Shes always there for me Its
just my nature to have a little
strange on the side It doesnt
mean shit

VOICE
But you still find it necessary

STU
Kind of like having a beautiful
home With everything you ever
dreamed of But you still need
that vacation now and then Some
nice hotel room with a great view
Maybe a pool Only you wouldnt
want to spend more than a few days
in any hotel Eventually you want
to go back to your home and all
your stuff Youre real glad to
check out

VOICE
Kelly is home and Mavis is a hotel
Im sure theyll both appreciate
that explanation

STU
Youre ruining my fucking life you
sonofabitch

VOICE

Didnt I warn you about calling me
names It makes me vindictive

STU
What else can you do to me

VOICE
We havent even begun

STU
Shes not home She went out

VOICE

Ill bet shes back Now hold the
cellular up where I can see it --
so I can be certain you dont
misdial on me

(pause)
A little higher and to your left

More violent rapping on the glass from the persistent black
lady outside

FELICIA
If you got you a cell phone how

block

FELICIA

She tries to pull open the sliding door to the booth but Stu
jams it shut right on her hand

FELICIA
You assaulted my person

STU

FELICIA
Youre hear alright Im coming

She stalks off obviously in search of assistance

VOICE

few minutes -- from a booth And I
said what would he be doing in any
phone booth

STU

KELLYS VOICE
You know exactly what I mean

STU
Youre not going to start that shit

KELLYS VOICE

Youre the one that sounds
frightened And of nobody

KELLYS VOICE
Hes not a nobody He knows about
us

STU
Youre not telling me all he said
What are you holding back

KELLYS VOICE
I cant discuss it on the phone
Just get over here

She hangs up

STU
(into pay phone)
Why did you do that to her She
never did you any harm

VOICE
How would you know Everybody does
harm to somebody And then they
try their best to forget it
STU
Maybe me -- but not her Whatever
Ive done theres no reason to
take it out on her

VOICE
Suppose thats the only way I can
get to you You claim you love
her

STU
Yeah I do

VOICE
You dont even love yourself

STU
But Kelly I would never hurt

VOICE
Still you have to uphold your
status as an honorary asshole

STU

Listen Ive treated all my women
decent I never laid a hand on any
of them even when provoked And I
always let them down easy

(beat)
Im not ready to let Kelly go
Maybe I never will be

VOICE
What if she dumps you first
Whats the odds shes already taken
up with somebody One day soon
youll come home and find her gone
along with the CD player and the
VCR

STU
Im not gonna let you mind-fuck me
all day Thats it This call is
ended

VOICE
Not until I say it is

STU
What happens if I hang up
VOICE
You dont really want to find out

STU
Im dying to hear this What the
fuck can you do about it -- up in

your fucking high window with your
goddam binoculars

VOICE
I never indicated I had binoculars
I said I had a highly magnified
telescopic image of you that
brought you up so close I could see
where you nicked yourself under the
chin shaving this morning

STU
Oh -- while youre at it have a
look up my ass

VOICE
I may very well do that Stu In
the meantime think about what kind
of device has a telescopic sight
mounted on it

STU
What You mean like a rifle

VOICE
A high-powered 30 calibre bolt
action Remington 700 with a carbon
one modification and a state of the
art Henzholdt tactical sniperscope
And youre in the cross hairs Stu

STU
Im supposed to believe that

VOICE
Theres only one way I can prove it
to you Hang up the receiver and
find out At this range the exit
wound ought to be about the size of
a small tangerine

STU
And youre just going to kill me
for no reason

VOICE
For plenty of reasons Because you
hung up For years I hated people
hanging up on me Ex-girlfriends
Women I didnt even know
Prospective employers

STU
I get hung up on all the time You
get used to it

VOICE
Or else you dont I worked for
months getting people to switch to
MCI -- being insulted at and being
hung up on hundreds of times a day
The ones that cursed me out for
invading their privacy never
bothered me as much as those that
clicked off without even bothering
to reply

STU
Then why didnt you go after one of
them

VOICE
Maybe you are one of them

STU
Hey I have worked in a boiler room
myself peddling Term Life I

Would never be rude to a fellow
salesperson

VOICE
Can you feel it on you now The
heat of it Im moving the strike
zone down to your stomach area
Now Im raising it up again
Directly above the chest cavity --
sliding up to the forehead just
above the left ear

STU
Shit -- I do feel it

VOICE
Tell me where Im going with it
now

STU
Across my forehead -- now back
where it was before

VOICE
Im amazed how you can do that
Youre amazingly accurate
(beat)
Now I know what youre thinking
If I drop down on the floor of the
booth and flatten myself out

STU
No Im not thinking that

VOICE
Oh yes you are Can I crawl out
using the booth as a shield Can I
crawl to that Chrysler illegally
parked only three or four feet
away The shattering glass may cut
me but itll only be superficial
Otherwise this lunatic will never
let me out alive

STU
No You will I know you will
If I just cooperate

VOICE
Where is it now Think and feel
for the warm spot

STU
Below the shoulder

VOICE
Which one

STU
The right shoulder

VOICE
Remarkable how were in tune
Youre doing far better than the
others

STU
What others What do you mean
(no reply)

You said others

VOICE
(finally)
Im sure you read about the Italian
tourist shot dead ten days ago at
the corner of Forty-fifth and
Eighth

STU
I saw it on the news

VOICE
And where are we now

STU
Oh God Forty-fifth and Eighth

VOICE
What else do you remember about
that killing

STU
I dont know

VOICE
Try

STU

He was gunned down And nobody was
caught And they didnt even
bother to take his wallet or his
watch or anything

VOICE
Now you know why It wasnt a
robbery

STU
What did he do

VOICE
He hung up -- so I disconnected him
permanently

STU
Please -- dont do it to me You

got no reason to do it to me

VOICE
Dont give me reason

STU
Im not looking to Tell me what
you want
VOICE
Tell me about your job

STU
Whats to tell Im in Public
Relations They used to call us
flacks Now were media
consultants

VOICE
What do you do exactly

STU
Plant items in the paper and on the
tube More important sometimes
keep stuff out

VOICE
Whatve you kept out

STU
One of my people got nailed for
indecent exposure I managed for

the cops to use his real name
instead of his stage name so nobody
picked up on it

VOICE
You saved the little deviates ass
didnt you

STU
Hes in major therapy now I swear
he is

VOICE
You must hang with some major
celebrities Journalists
newscasters -- those types
STU

Im real close with Larry King
And the Hard Copy people

VOICE
Could you get him down here Larry
King

STU
Why would he want to come here

VOICE
Because you asked him to

STU
He comes from Atlanta

VOICE
Well who could you get

STU
I dont know

VOICE
Wolf Blitzer

VOICE
Probably not

VOICE
Regis

STU

Definitely no chance

VOICE
Youd be offering them an exclusive
newsbreak Im talking about more
than one homicide

STU
How many

VOICE
I dont answer questions I ask
them

STU

I gotta have the facts They might
not believe me My record isnt
too good when it comes to hard
news

VOICE
Youre not considered a reliable
source

STU
On a divorce or separation maybe
Or whos gay or who isnt gay any
more I kind of specialize in that
kind of material I mean I could
probably get you Joe Franklin
VOICE
How about Cindy Adams

STU
I might have a shot Are you
familiar with Liz Smith

VOICE
Do you know her number

STU
Want I should call her How much
can I say

VOICE
Tell her youre in direct touch
with a killer whos willing to
speak honestly if she shows up here
alone and without notifying the
authorities

STU
She usually likes to have a
celebrity involved If you had an
actor or a sports figure held
prisoner instead of me thered be
better odds shes come

VOICE
Then lie Pick a celebrity and put
them in the booth

STU
Lets see Who does she like Who
couldnt be reached to deny it

VOICE
Im anxious to see you in action
Dont keep me waiting

Stu uses his cellular again

STU

(dialing)
Sometimes you only get her service

(into cellular)
Hi -- Stu Shepard Put me through
Ive got hard news for her I can
only talk to her directly But say
it regards -- Liza

VOICE
Liza That was imaginative

STU

(into cellular)
No I cant call back Ill have
to lay in on somebody else
Alright but I cant hang on long

(to pay phone)
Shes coming on

(to cellular)
Liz hello Sure Ill make it
brief Killing two weeks ago in
the theatre district Turn out a
sniper did the job Yeah a sniper
with a rifle Now hes got another
victim lined up Not just your
anonymous New Yorker but Liza
Now you cant call anybody or Ms
Minellis dead meat and so am I
Shes hostage in a phone booth
right in the snipers sights But
he says hell talk to you and let
her walk I know itll take balls
to do this but youre a fine and
courageous newspaper woman

Theres a click Silence

STU
Hello Hello
(to pay phone)
Either shes on her way over or she
doesnt believe me

VOICE
You werent particularly
convincing

STU

I didnt really believe in what I
was saying

VOICE
Because you dont really believe my
Remington is pointed at you

STU
I do

VOICE
Youre ninety percent sure
STU
At least ninety-five percent easy

VOICE
Let me erase all doubt

STU
No Dont shoot

VOICE
Control yourself Stu Glance down
at your chest What do you see

STU
Oh my God A dot A fucking red
dot

A tiny red dot now moves across Stus chest

VOICE
Like youve seen in the movies

STU
The laser dot Just before some
poor bastard always gets blown
away

VOICE
Usually a supporting player That
lovely but by now generic special
effect of the bullet piercing the
forehead

The tiny red laser dot dances around Stus chest and stomach
-- the jumps up and remains between his eyes

VOICE
This takes all the guesswork out of
it You know exactly where to
expect it before I even tighten my
finger on the trigger

STU
Dont tighten Dont even tickle
that fucking finger

VOICE
How about Geraldo Hes run his
ass off to get in on this

STU
Youre talking about the old
Geraldo Look I can try and reach
cable NBC Theyre hungry

VOICE
Im disappointed I wanted to go
first class

STU
They do a great job Theyll haul
a whole crew over to cover your
surrender live

VOICE
I never expressed interest in
giving myself up There are so
many other phone booths in the
city Im just getting warmed up

STU
Thats entirely up to you Your
choice Im just trying to set you
up with the proper communicator
(beat)
I suppose Liza wasnt strong
enough I shouldve said Madonna

VOICE
Now youre being creative

Outside the booth the angry black woman has returned
bringing with her a gaudily dressed pimp named LEON who looks
like he means business He slams his fist against the glass
nearly shattering it

LEON
Drag your baggy butt out of that
booth We got business to conduct
out of there

FELICIA
He been in there all day

STU
Im not through

LEON
Hang up that receiver or Ill make
you eat the fucking thing

STU
Fuck off or Ill call a cop
LEON
Do you see one around here What
you think Im gonna be doing while
youre waiting for a prowl car to
get assigned Im about to cut you
a second asshole if you dont
vacate those premises

STU
I cant

FELICIA
Hes got him a fucking cellular
Whats he need to be on our booth
for

STU
I cant explain it

LEON
Im not interested in your
explanations even if you had any

He withdraws a switchblade knife from his pocket but doesnt
open it -- yet

LEON
If I flick this I use it

STU
Ill make it worth your while to go
away How much do you want

LEON
Make me an offer

STU
Thirty dollars Its all Ive got
in cash Take it and go

LEON
Youre offering to rent my phone
booth For how long

STU
I dont know For as long as it
takes

LEON

Whats so special in there

sTU
Do you want the money

LEON
Is that a genuine Rolex youve got
on

STU
Come on man Thats my good
watch

LEON

Thats what its gonna take

STU
Then here Take the damn thing

LEON
And the thirty

STU
Take it all

The pimp pockets the watch and the money But doesnt go
away

LEON
Now Im satisfied But you still
got to deal with Felicia here I
believe you spoke harshly to her

STU
I apologize

LEON
And did her some injury

STU
An accident Im sorry about that
too

FELICIA
The man dont sound like he means
it

LEON
I agree

(to Stu)
Why dont you hang up a minute so
we can discuss this matter at
length

sTU
Its long distance I cant lose
the call -- I might not get them
back

LEON
Do I have to rip that fucking phone
out of there

STU
That wouldnt be a good idea
(into pay phone)
Would it

VOICE
Not at all

STU
I gave you everything Ive got

LEON
That pinky ring looks attractive
Felicia might like that

FELICIA
It might fit

STU
You want the ring youve got the
ring If I can get it off

LEON
I can get it off you

Leon reaches in and grabs Stus ring hand

STU
Let go of me Its coming loose
There
(he tosses it)
Okay Felicia with my deepest
apologies Goodbye now

LEON
Whats really going on in that
booth -- that escapes the naked
eye

STU

Nothing Talk Thats all

LEON
That your connection on the end of
the line Or are you dealing

STU
This has nothing to do with drugs

LEON
You gotta be high on something to
willingly divest yourself of your
valuables -- just to maintain
occupancy of a fucking phone booth
that the local bums piss in every
night

STU
I knew it smelled for some reason

LEON
You look like youre ready to piss
yourself

STU
Because I am

LEON
Maybe if the city provided decent
public toilets folks wouldnt
relieve themselves in the subway
stations and phone booths

STU
Ill take it up with the mayor

LEON
Next thing you know youre gonna
claim we mugged you -- took your

billfold and watch

STU
No you didnt It was a fair and
equitable deal You had
territorial rights to this booth
and I paid a license fee Fair is
fair Now leave me in peace

LEON

You sure youre alright
(to Felicia)
He dont look well

FELICIA
Kind of pale Even for a white
man
LEON
Jaundice they calls it Probably
advanced liver trouble
(to Stu)
If its cirrhosis you better find
yourself a twelve step program and
quick

STU
Thanks for your interest but Im in
perfect health

FELICIA
So how come his hand is shaking

LEON
The man is cracking up

FELICIA
Lookit the sweat pouring off the
sonofabitch Thats one sick
mother you started up with Leon

LEON
Me Youre the one that brought me
over and exposed me to all his
germs

STU
Im terminal okay Now can I
close the booth and continue my
conversation

LEON
Im worried now it might be
catching All that money out of
your sweaty pocket is probably
crawling with some rare and
incurable disease

STU
Fine Give it back

LEON
What goods that We done touched
it

STU
Well go wash your hands

LEON
Come on now Own up to what youre
carrying Is it some of that
sexually transmitted shit Cause
in that case we can relax

STU
Im sick of you Now get out of my
face

LEON

Here wes being solicitous as to
your health and you respond by
heaping abuse

FELICIA
Whip his arrogant ass

Leon reaches into the booth and grabs Stus jacket

STU
Touch me and Ill throw up on you

At the suggestion Leon lets go quickly

It looks like a stalemate Stu isnt vacating the booth and
Leon and his lady are reluctant to touch him further He
does indeed look sick

STU
(into pay phone)
You can see what Im up against
here

VOICE
Want me to get rid of him for you

STU
What do you have in mind

VOICE
Ill think of something

Suddenly the red dot reappears on the forehead of the pimp

Leon doesnt realize its there The hooker behind him has
no way of seeing it But to Stu theres no way to miss it
He reacts

STU
God -- no
(into pay phone)
Dont Its not necessary
VOICE
You asked for my help

STU
Ill handle it myself

VOICE
Youre not doing too well I can
settle it in a fraction of a
second Shall I demonstrate

STU
No
(to Leon)
For your own safety mister just
walk away

LEON
Now the man is turning
aggressive issuing threats upon
my person

STU

Youre making this happen

LEON
If you dont hang up and step out
Im about to topple this booth into
the gutter with you inside it

Reluctant to touch Stu again Leon assaults the booth itself
He begins shaking it violently -- trying to rip it from its
foundation And the rickety booth is not too sturdy It
starts rocking back and forth

Stu is thrown around inside it barely keeping his footing

STU
(into pay phone)
This isnt my fault
(shouts)
Stop that

But Leon continues rocking the booth It wont come loose --
so in frustration he punches in a side pane of glass

The glass shatters all around Stu who does his best to
shield himself from the slivers

STU
(into pay phone)
The guys insane

VOICE
Only one way to stop a mad dog
Give me permission

STU
I cant

VOICE
If he forces you out of that booth
Ive told you what to expect You
or him Stu

Leon is smashing other panes of glass now -- one after
another -- as Stu cowers inside
FELICIA

Dont cut yourself honey

A crowd of derelicts and street people are now gathering to
watch the out of control pimp take out his wrath on the booth
and its occupant

DERELICT
Looks like the fucker is comin
loose

STREET PERSON
Shove it out into the oncoming
traffic

DERELICT
Whatll you bet the bus could knock
that fifty feet

The booth is being decimated but Stu hangs onto the phone

STU
(into pay phone)
Hello Hello

VOICE

(with heavy static)
Youre breaking up Were about to
be cut off

STU
I cant help it

VOICE
That counts as a hang-up
STU
No It cant Thats not fair

VOICE
I can still make him stop Say the
word Can you hear me

STU
Yes

Stu sees the red dot reappear on Leons chest as he continues
to barrage the booth with punches and kicks

Then Leon recoils staggers a step backward He doesnt
realize hes been shot

Theres been no sound of gunfire Perhaps a silencer was
used -- or the downtown traffic drowned out the solitary
discharge

Leon looks confused at first His ladyfriend has no idea
hes wounded -- neither do the derelicts and street people
whove assembled on the corner

Even Stu isnt sure -- until the blood starts oozing from the
wound on the pimps chest -- staining his yellow vest

He isnt assaulting the booth anymore Hes trying to keep
his balance He slumps forward hanging onto the booth for
support -- only a few inches from Stus face The blood runs
down the side of the booth

STU
(into pay phone)
You did it
VOICE
You said yes
STU
I said Yes I can hear you Not
Yes -- kill the motherfucker
VOICE

Dont try to renege on it I was
following orders

STU
Youre twisting it all around I
didnt do this
Meanwhile Leon leans upright against the booth Then his
legs cave in and he begins to slide to his knees

Felicia runs up beside him She sees the blood

FELICIA
I warned you not to cut yourself
(to crowd)
Look at all that blood He mustve
hit an artery

She screams as Leon topples backwards onto the pavement Now
his chest wound is evident

FELICIA
Oh Jesus What is that Talk to
me What happened

The crowd tightens around the fallen body Street people who
are fascinated but not shocked

DERELICT
Gunshot

STREET PERSON
Yeah Sucking chest wound right
over the heart

FELICIA
Somebody call an ambulance

STREET PERSON
Call the meatwagon Hes fucked

up

FELICIA
You shut the fuck up

Her focus turns to Stu in the battered phone booth

FELICIA
Why did you do that to him

STU
I didnt

FELICIA
(to crowd)
You all saw it He shot my man
without no provocation

DERELICT
Yeah Pumped one right into him at
close range

STU
How could I I dont even have a
gun Look

STREET PERSON
Everybody get the fuck back They
shoot one -- then they shoot
everybody in sight Kill all the
fucking witnesses

The crowd disperses to doorways and around the corner -- out
of immediate range

STU
Come back Youve got to see --
Im not armed

Only Felicia remains leaning over the pimps body staring
helplessly

FELICIA
Hang up and dial 911 Geta
doctor

STU

I cant hang up Thats what this
is all about

FELICIA
Youre gonna stand there and let
him die

STU

(takes out cellular)
I can use this

(he dials)
Emergency Yes Theres been a
shooting at Forty-fifth and Eighth
-- on the corner A man is down
Whats the difference who I am I
dont want to be involved

FELICIA
(shouts)
Thats bullshit Hes the shooter
Youre talking to the shooter

Stu quickly disconnects the cellular
STU
That wasnt nice

FELICIA
Go ahead -- make a fucking run for
it I hope they gun you down --
like you did him

STU
Im not going anyplace Im
staying right here in this booth
(into pay phone)
Unless you give me permission

VOICE
Youre attracting a lot of
attention I suppose when the
police get there youll accuse me

STU
What do you expect me to say

VOICE
Thats up to you But any mention
of me will not be appreciated

STU
You mean

VOICE
You wont even get to finish your
sentence Oh look that little red
dot is dancing around all over you
again You saw how quickly it can
happen And how accurate I can be

STU
They cant blame me -- Im not
armed

VOICE

Whos going to believe that With
all those witnesses to the
contrary

STU
They can see with their own eyes

Not far away we hear the BLAST of POLICE SIRENS drawing
closer

VOICE
Remember to leave me out of it

STU
How can I

VOICE
Youll put the proper spin on it
Isnt that your specialty Feeding
the public a story that may not
have a shred of truth -- and making
it totally believable

STU
This isnt a story This is real
This is murder

VOICE
If youd only dealt with the man
reasonably shown him some respect
this might not have been necessary

STU
I gave him my money my watch

VOICE
But not your respect Which is
what he required of you

STU
He was a fucking thief

VOICE
And now hes a fucking dead thief
Do you feel better about that

STU
I dont feel a bit guilty This is
all your doing

VOICE
Now youre being disrespectful of
me You never learn Your job is
to deal with people -- but youre

not good at it

STU
Hey Im not taking any more
criticism from some lunatic sniper
who gets his kicks killing
strangers

VOICE
You keep insisting Im a stranger
Probably because you dont
recognize the voice But there are
cheap electronic devices available
that disguise the voice I might
not even be a man I might be one
of those many women youve almost
totally forgotten One who doesnt
forgive easily One who wants to
watch you squirm

STU
Youre a man I know youre a man
Women dont kill with telescopic
rifles They stab you

VOICE
You sound so sure of that But
youve never provoked any man as
much as have the women in your
life And so many of them Stu
(a beat)
Do you even remember their names

STU
Ive got no time to rehash my whole
life Oh my God The cops are
here

Police cars are pulling up on all sides of Eighth Avenue

Traffic has suddenly been shut down Prowl cars have now
blocked the streets

PRODUCTION NOTE Everything is seen from Stus perspective
without intercuts

Half a dozen cops now emerge and approach with drawn guns

FELICIA
(pointing)
Thats him -- in the booth Hes

got a gun

As she hurls accusations shes lugging Leons lifeless body
out into the gutter into the center of Eighth Avenue

Its a bright afternoon In the distance we hear the
maddening HONKING of uptown traffic that is now being
rerouted creating a huge bottleneck and raising the anger of
irate motorists and bus drivers whose horns provide their
simplest form of protest Its a discordant concert that
echoes the confusion and frustration which Stu now feels
As the cops surround the booth -- at a distance

SERGEANT
(into bullhorn)
Throw down your weapon and come out
with your hands raised

sTU
(into phone)
Theyre ordering me to come out

VOICE
I can see that Ignore them

STU
What if they open fire

VOICE
They probably wont Look across
on the east side of the street Do
you see the tourist with the home
video camera

STUS POV

A distant crowd gathering on the opposite west side corner
behind the police cars Some tourist is capturing the event
on video

BACK TO STU

STU
What about him

VOICE
Hes going to keep the police on
their best behavior So long as
you dont take what could be
interpreted as hostile action
youll be safe

STU
You call this safe Six cops with
guns pointed my way

VOICE
You want me to reduce them to three
-- or two

sTU
Absolutely no more shooting Now
is that clear

VOICE
You can always change your mind

SERGEANT
(with bullhorn)
You know the drill Hands clasped
behind the back of your neck --
moving slowly -- step out of the
booth If we see any sign of a
weapon we will respond

STU
(shouts)
You wont because there isnt any

SERGEANT
(bul lhorn)
I repeat Raise your hands

STU
I cant Im on a phone call

Now a black POLICE CAPTAIN arrives and takes full command of
the situation

CAPTAIN RAMEY
You have thirty seconds to comply

STU
I told you Im busy Come back
later

VOICE

Very good Stu

The cops take cover behind parked cars keeping Stu clearly
in their sights He has no place to hide Hes in the
battered phone booth in plain view from all sides

RAMEY
Youve been given an order

The Sergeant slides up beside the Captain to confer

PRODUCTION NOTE We remain in LONG SHOT of the cops -- always
from Stus POV But we can hear their voices and all that is
said as if they were in close up It has an odd unreal and
distancing effect
SERGEANT
Were dealing with a mental case
Hes looking for us to kill him

RAMEY
Well hes not getting his wish

In the center of the street an ambulance pulls up and a team
of medics jump out They rush to Leons body (Again we
hear their voices close even though visually they are far
off)

FELICIA
Tell me hes gonna be alright

MEDIC
Step aside Let us look at him

The medics push her aside -- then examine the victim Hes
DOA

MEDIC
Nothing we can do Dont touch the
body Theyll need it to mark the
crime scene

Far across the street the Captain confers with his
subordinates They are small figures on the screen but we
hear them sharply

SERGEANT
Same corner as two weeks ago

RAMEY
Maybe its more than a coincidence
Cover me I need to talk to him
SERGEANT

Youve got your vest on

RAMEY
What do you think

The Captain steps out of cover and boldly approaches the
phone booth He stops cautiously about fifteen feet away

RAMEY
Im not armed

STU
Neither am I
RAMEY
Yeah sure I need to know what
happened

STU
Cant talk about it

RAMEY
Sure you can My names Ramey
Captain Ed Ramey Whats yours

STU
Look I dont want to be friends

RAMEY
You look like you need a friend

VOICE
Tell him youve already got a
friend

STU
(yells)
Ive got a friend okay

RAMEY
Is that who youre talking to on
the phone

STU
None of your business

RAMEY
When somebody gets shot it becomes
my business Lets not have

anybody else killed I want to
hear your side of it

STU
Ive got no side of it

VOICE
Dont worry Stu Ive got him
fixed right in my sights I wont
let him hurt you

RAMEY
Has this happened to you before
The need to hurt someone To put a
bullet in them

sTU
You wont believe anything I say

RAMEY
Try me

STU
I couldnt shoot anybody Im not
armed

RAMEY

Youre right I dont believe you
Whats that bulge in your pants
pocket

STU
That Thats my cellular

RAMEY
A cellular Then what are you
doing in a phone booth making
calls

STU
Do you want to see it

RAMEY
Dont reach for it mister

STU
Then how can I show it to you

RAMEY
dont need to see it I know
whats there All these witnesses
saw you use it on him

From behind a parked car a HOMELESS PERSON calls out
STREET PERSON

(hollers)
Damn straight

Another DERELICT crouched in a doorway joins in

DERELICT
(shouts)
Yeah Shot him down like a dog

STU
Theyre all lying Nobody saw it
because it didnt happen
RAMEY
A man is dead but it didnt happen

STU
Not on account of me This is like
some bad dream

RAMEY
Youre walking through a bad dream
and you cant wake up Do you want
to wake up

sTU
Im trying

RAMEY
And in this dream you killed that
man He was bothering you so you
iced him

STU
No

RAMEY
Then who did

VOICE

Dont tell him Stu Or itll be
the last thing he ever hears His
blood will be on your hands

STU
(to Ramey)
I dont know
RAMEY

But you saw it happen

STU
Yes

RAMEY
You were the closest one to him
You mustve seen who did it

STU
No

RAMEY
Were trying to be honest with each
other arent we
STU
Not necessarily

VOICE
Im losing patience with this cop

STU
(into phone)
Im handling this

RAMEY
Who do you keep talking to on the
phone

STU

Nobody My psychiatrist

VOICE
Excellent Stu Youre getting
good at this

RAMEY
Whats this doctors name Its
important we know

STU
He says not to tell you Its
privileged information

VOICE
Damn good reply Now youre having
fun Admit it

STU
Whatever you say

VOICE
Playing it so close to the edge
Ill bet youve never felt so
alive Thats how I feel when I
look through the sight and select
somebody

The Captain begins advancing a few steps closer

RAMEY
I respect your right to privacy
Ive been to therapy myself The
department provides it I know
its not good form for a cop to be
admitting that but
VOICE
Tell him not to come any closer

STU
Stop right there Back up a few
steps Back where you were

RAMEY
If it makes you more comfortable

VOICE
Tell him to read you your rights

STU
I want you to read me my rights and
stop asking questions

RAMEY
Al least tell me your first name

STU
Its my right not to have any name

RAMEY
No gun and no name Youre a
highly underprivileged person

VOICE
Demand a lawyer

STU
And get me a lawyer too I wanta
lawyer brought down here to
negotiate my surrender

VOICE
Brilliant Stu Keep winging it

RAMEY
Itll be hard to find a lawyer
willing to risk his life But if
you hand over the gun

STU
How can I when you wont let me
take it out

RAMEY
Well take it out for you -- as
soon as you exit the booth with
your hands raised and
STU

(interrupts)
Now were back to that again Its
always Get out of the booth
You cant stay in the booth
Well I like it in the fucking
booth Its my whole world now
Its my booth and Im never coming
out

RAMEY
Were not about to force you
because there could be a
miscalculation and then wed never
find out why this happened

STU
Why is it so important to know
The guy is dead Isnt that
enough Knowing isnt going to
make him alive again So who gives
a fuck

RAMEY
Its what makes the job
interesting Finding out why
Something drove you to do this
You didnt go out today expecting
this to happen It was a nice day
You were out for a walk And then
suddenly it all changed

STU
All I wanted was to make a phone
call One lousy phone call for
thirty-five fucking cents

VOICE
Careful Stu Dont volunteer too
much

RAMEY
You got some bad news on that call

STU
The worst

RAMEY
Something that pushed you over the
edge

sTU
And Ive been falling ever since

RAMEY
Time to land

STU
When you hit bottom you die

RAMEY
Im your safety net

STU
If I tell you what you want to know
-- youll die too

Something about the implied threat sends a chill through
Captain Ramey

INSERT SHOT

The Captains head as seen through a telescopic sight
Ramey could be dead in an instant

PRODUCTION NOTE The only time we deviate from Stus
perspective is when we see the snipers POV through his
scope

ANGLE BACK ON STU IN THE BOOTH

the detective fifteen feet away

Ramey decides to back off momentarily

RAMEY
Ill go see about that lawyer

STU
Now thats a good idea

The Captain withdraws back across the street

VOICE
Hes lucky I had him centered in
my cross hairs I really had to

restrain myself
We hear the approach of a helicopter

Stu peers up ward as not one but two choppers appear above
the tall buildings
VOICE
Its not the police Its the
media Youre news Stuart

The helicopters circle above

VOICE
Youve never gotten this much press
for any of your clients Im

making you a famous person

STU
Theyre just hoping for coverage of
me dying in the gutter

VOICE
Their presence is putting the
police on their continued best

behavior

STU
Those cops are just looking for any
excuse

VOICE

Then dont give them one

Then as if on cue Stus cellular phone in his pocket starts
ringing

But he cant allows himself to reach for it To do so might
cause the police to believe he was trying to draw his gun

It rings quietly -- virtually inaudible outside the booth
Drowned out by the traffic horns the static from the police
radios and the newly introduced sound of television
helicopters circling over Eighth Avenue taking video coverage
of the event below

VOICE
Who could it be

STU
Kelly She was worried about me

Stu is afraid to reach in his pocket lest the cops think hes
going for a gun

VOICE
Maybe shes seen this on
television It must be on every
channel by now Breaking news
STU
She doesnt watch daytime TV

VOICE
One of the neighbors couldve
alerted her

The cell phone keeps ringing almost drowned out by the sound
of helicopters circling overhead

STU
Why are you saying this You want
me to reach in my pocket so you can
see them open fire

VOICE
Thats an unwarranted accusation
and very unbecoming in light of the
good advice Ive given in the past
Have I ever steered you wrong

STU
God -- how Id love to hear her
voice

VOICE

t might even be worth it Shes
insistent isnt she

The cellular wont stop ringing

STU
f she knows Im in trouble she
wont give up

VOICE

Probably glued to the TV by now

m watching coverage on two

stations now Channel surfing
(pause)

Well there you are on two and four

and five Not any decent angles on

you though stuck inside there

The cell phone continues beeping until the sound of it is
maddening Stu is still afraid to reach for it and provide
the cops with an excuse to open fire

VOICE
But if youd take one or two steps
outside and look up I think they
could get a clear picture of you

STU
You said Im not allowed to leave
the booth

Finally the cell phone stops ringing

VOICE
I might be willing to bend the
rules and let you enjoy your moment
of fame Set the phone down
without hanging up and take a
step or two outside Just fora
minute Then come straight back in
or Ill be forced to provide live
coverage that should rival the
historic Zapruder footage
(beat)
Nothing like an exploding head to
excite viewer interest

STU
No thanks Ill stay where I am

VOICE
It was only a suggestion Since
youre convinced Im going to plug
you anyway it cant matter much

STU
If you shoot me you give yourself
away

VOICE

Even without a muffler theyd
never hear the report with all this
noise Afterwards itd take them
a good ten minutes to realize you
werent plugged by some overzealous
officer Then theyll blame the
media for inciting a crackpot
vigilante to come down here and do
the SWAT teams job for them

STU
You expected them to come You had
this all worked out

VOICE
I write the scenario and you all
play your parts -- as directed
The damned cell phone starts beeping again Stu fights the
temptation to grab for it and hear Kellys voice for one last
time

STU
Poor Kelly What she must be going
through

VOICE

Why dont you tell her how you feel
about her

STU
Id never get the words out Not
with fifteen or twenty rounds in
me

VOICE
You cant be certain theyd fire
Theyd see it was only a phone

STU
They wouldnt wait to see

The cellular ringing continues jangling Stus nerves

STU
Why doesnt she hang up

Then Stu notices something in the crowd gathering far across
the street behind the police barricades Countless faces
rubbernecking probably hoping to see some display of
violence that would end with him face down dead on the
pavement

And in the midst of them -- one face familiar to him A
female quite pretty even in tears Its Kelly (We see
her only in LONG SHOT -- a distant figure in bright green

jacket that makes her stand out from the crowd)

STU
Its her Shes not calling me
Shes over there

VOICE
Is she

STU
The blonde girl in the green
jacket
VOICE
Cant miss her Very attractive
isnt she

STU
She mustve heard all the commotion
and come downstairs

The cellular is still ringing

STU
Its somebody else who knows my
cell number
(beat)
Its you

VOICE
You continue to impress

STU
Why is it so important that they
kill me

VOICE

Because thats how I win

STU
This time you wont If you want
me dead youll have to do it
yourself

VOICE
Either way I cant lose

STU
Its all a game to you -- because
youre incapable of feelings
Youre not even human

VOICE
I pride myself on that Whats so
great about being human Its the
lowest form of life on this planet
and Ive taken it upon myself to
thin the herd

STU
I quit Im not answering back any
more I wont hang up but Im not

playing

Theres silence now between them
VOICE
Stu Stu dont be that way
Youre taking the pleasure out of
it

Stu doesnt take the bait He remains absolutely silent
A stalemate has been reached
WE RACK FOCUS ACROSS THE STREET TO THE POLICE

clustered behind an emergency vehicle The Sergeant brings a
civilian to meet Captain Ramey of the SWAT unit The
newcomer wears coveralls stenciled ATandT (Although they
are very far away we hear their voices close up as they come
into sharper focus)

SERGEANT
This heres Helfand of New York
Telephone

HELFAND

Glad to help out

RAMEY
Have you got the number of that
booth

HELFAND
Sure do

RAMEY

Can you tap into that call

HELFAND
It can be done

SERGEANT
But not without a warrant You
could be violating this psychos
civil rights Especially if hes
on the line with his fucking
psychiatrist

RAMEY
Shit I dont want to blow this on
a technicality Tracing the call
isnt any violation is it

SERGEANT
As long as we dont listen in
We remain in LONG SHOT of the POLICE as they continue in
heated conversation

RAMEY
(to Helfand)
Okay weve got to know who hes
talking to and their current
location

HELFAND
That I can handle As long as they
keep the circuit open

RAMEY
I need the number and an address to
go with it

Helfand rushes off At the corner we can glimpse him
entering a phone company utility truck parked on Forty-Fifth
Street

RACK FOCUS BACK TO PHONE BOOTH

Stu remains tight lipped and silent refusing to give his
tormentor the conversation he so craves

VOICE
Stuart my friend Do you want to
see how close I can come without
actually hitting you

Stu resists pleading because he knows his silence is more
powerful

Theres no glass in the left side of the booth since the late
Leon smashed it all out

Nothing to shatter when the sniper squeezes off his shot
VOICE
May I call attention to the yellow

pages

The frayed yellow phonebook dangling from a chain under the
telephone shudders under the impact of a direct hit

Theres been no sound of a gunshot but the damage is there
to behold

Stu reaches for the phonebook
Theres a bullet hole straight through it Pieces of the 30
calibre slug have shattered into many tiny fragments and are
imbedded between the pages half-way through the thick
volume

Stu pries pieces out of the pages of the directory He looks
at them in the palm of his hand

VOICE
Hollow points are designed to break
up on impact It wouldve behaved
differently if it had pierced your
soft flesh The pieces wouldve
bounced around looking for a way
out Thats where the real damage
occurs -- finding an exit --
deflecting off all that bone

Stu wants to shout STOP but restrains himself Not
talking gives him some degree of power

VOICE
Still the silent treatment My
father used to dish that out when
he chose to punish me Not a word
spoken -- one time for over a
month Id try and goad him to
acknowledge I existed but he
stared right through me Youre
bringing back unhappy childhood
Stu Thats not wise

Stu still declines to answer His silence seems his only
weapon He tosses the bullet fragments out of the booth onto
the pavement

VOICE

Since youre ignoring me Ill
focus on someone else

(a beat)
There she is -- nice and sharp I
can see the two little punctures in
each earlobe and my God what kind
of a girl would have her nostril
pierced

Stu realizes the sniper now has Kelly in his sights

STU
No

VOICE
What was that Louder Stu We
must have a bad connection

STU
Leave her out of it

VOICE
I didnt expect her to show up
here But since she has -- Ill
improvise

STU
Dont Please dont Im sorry

Im talking to you again Ill
talk all you want

VOICE
Its a bad dye job The black
roots are growing in and it makes
her look cheap

STU
Ive screwed up her life enough
already Please dont hurt her

VOICE
I dont necessarily have to kill
her I could be persuaded to
settle for a reasonable mutilation
Which part of her displeases you
most If she turns a bit more in
profile Im accurate enough to
remove the tip of her unpleasantly
protruding nose Its just
cartilage Any decent cosmetic
surgeon will have her looking
better than ever

STUS POV - FOCUS SHIFTS TO KELLY

in the crowd Distant yet distinct amongst the curious
onlookers

JUMP CUT
CLOSER ON KELLY -- OBLIVIOUS TO HER DANGER
AS SEEN THROUGH CROSS HAIRS OF TELESCOPIC SIGHT

following her as she forces her way through the crowd toward
the police officers
Her face virtually fills the screen

PRODUCTION NOTE The only time we deviate from Stu and his
POV is when we see the snipers own POV through his

telescopic sight

VOICE

You can see her talking to the
police now Shes identifying
herself as your wife Theyre very
interested in who you are Theyre
taking her over to see the officer
in charge What was his name

SNIPERS POV

Through the cross hairs of the sniperscope

we can see Kelly

conversing with Captain Ramey Shes in a state of complete

agitation

ANGLE ON STU

half leaning out of the booth staring at his wife and the

cops in the distance

RACK FOCUS TO THEM --

and suddenly we can hear them clearly in spite of the

distance

KELLY

What do you mean psychiatrist

doesnt see any psychiatrist

RAMEY

Then whod your husband be talking

to

KELLY

There was some guy that called the
house this morning and said weird

stuff to me

RAMEY

Stu seems to be checking things out

with this person

KELLY

He hasnt got many friends -- I can

tell you that

RAMEY
Remain here please We may need
you later

KELLY
You wont hurt him

RAMEY
Well do our best not to

Kelly is left alone as the Captain returns to their command
center

Kelly is once again a solitary target She could be picked
off without attracting undue attention

VOICE
She wont even feel it when it
happens
BACK TO PHONE BOOTH
STU

Take me instead

VOICE
Dont distract me Nows the time
to be absolutely still I have to
hold my breath as I squeeze
gently --

STU
No Im hanging up Thats it

Stu hangs up the receiver He disconnects
RACK FOCUS TO LONG SHOT --

The police as they react We see a flurry of activity across
the street Voices become clear as focus shifts

RAMEY
Shit He hung up

SERGEANT
Maybe they already traced it
Anyhow it doesnt matter Looks
like hes coming out

RACK FOCUS BACK TO STU --

slowly stepping out of the booth His hands are raised
STU
(shouts)
Ive giving myself up Take me

SWAT OFFICER
(distant)
First the gun We want to see you
toss away your weapon

STU
Shit I cant

SWAT OFFICER
(distant)
Freeze where you are Turn around
and keep those hands clasped
(signals the others)
Take him

The SWAT OFFICERS in protective gear now step out of cover
and fan out as they approach the booth

TIGHTER ON STU

Hes just outside the booth -- expecting to feel the snipers
bullet go through him at any moment

Then the pay phone starts ringing

The sniper is calling back

RACK FOCUS AGAIN

to the police

All the cops react Particularly the Captain and the

Sergeant Their voices seem close up when they sharpen in
focus

SERGEANT
What is going on with these fucking
phone calls

RAMEY
(shouts)
Hold your fire Let him answer it

The SWAT team backs up but maintain their aim

SERGEANT
Are you nuts
RAMEY
Let them talk Hes not going
anywhere
(shouts)
Hes going back inside the booth

Indeed we see Stu re-enter the battered phone booth and pick
up the receiver

FOCUS RETURNS TO STU

STU
(into pay phone)
Yeah

A strange voice begins chattering away in Spanish Totally
unintelligible to Stu

STU
(into pay phone)
You got the wrong number Hang up

The voice probably a Puerto Rican gentleman rattles on in
Spanish

STU
Wrong number Wrong number

Then the voice on the phone suddenly alters the Hispanic
accent It is the now familiar tone of his tormentor

VOICE
Aw relax Stu Only yanking your
chain Now can we start over

STU

Those cops wont wait much longer

VOICE

What else can they do They cant
afford to just shoot you like I
can Not with so much media
coverage Not unless you make some
stupid aggressive move

(beat)
The ABC Mobile Unit just rolled up

Across the street Stu can see various TV units from local
stations setting up cameras on roofs of trucks

STU
Will you look at that I must be
going out over the network Bet
theyre pre-empting usual
programming

VOICE
And just think -- if you survive
this your trial will be televised
And you can try and make the world
believe I ever existed Id be
your only defense

STU
How are they gonna prove that I
killed anybody when theres no gun

VOICE
Theyll plant one The police
arent above that -- when theyre

desperate to convict

STU
No sir No gun and I walk

VOICE
Dont you think I took that into
account Am I a fool

STU
What do you mean

VOICE
Havent I considered every
eventuality I knew theyd come
and cordon off the block
(beat)
And that thered have to be a gun
someplace

STU
Where

VOICE
Its a small booth Stu Have you
checked every inch of it

STU
(looking up and down)
Its not on the floor

VOICE
Then whats left
Stu peers upward at the clouded plastic

dirty

STU
Up above

VOICE
Could be Why dont you reach up
there and lift the plastic sheet --
and feel around

STU
f they see me reach for something
they could open fire

VOICE
They could But you have to know
if its there Dont you

fq

STU
totally dont give a shit

VOICE
n a narrow space tucked just to
the left of the fluorescent bulb
You can almost see it outlined if
you look closely

now stained and

There are shadows of objects above in the shallows
area around the light fixture that automatically goes on when
the door to the phone booth is tightly closed

Stu opens and closes the door a few times
click on -- watching the shadows around the light

Could that be an accumulation of dirt

Or could something be stashed up there

STU
It doesnt matter I know about
ballistics The slug in that dead
guy came from your rifle not any
handgun

VOICE
You saw how hollow points splinter
on impact Theres nothing much
for ballistics to match to The
same make 30 calibre bullets are
in that handgun The prosecution
rests

STU
Theres no gun up there I dont

watching the light

dust or dead insects
see a damn thing

VOICE
Slide your finger up under the
plastic and youll feel the cold
metal surface There are four
rounds left in it Should you
decide to shoot your way out

STU
I could never shoot anybody

VOICE
You could shoot me Stu Youd do
that in a minute if you could

STU
And Id fucking love it

VOICE
Now youre speaking from the heart
Come on just lift the partition a
few inches and feel whats there
for you

STU
Im not getting my fingerprints on
your fucking weapon What about
powder residue How are they going
to explain that to a jury

VOICE
Do you think thatll matter with so
many eye witnesses
(beat)
Do it or should I re-focus my
attention on Kelly

STU
No

VOICE

You carefully distracted me from
her before and I let you get away
with it But if youre not going
to play fairly --

(a pause)
There she is again So close I
feel like I could touch her

STU
Get off her
VOICE
Then mind me when I speak

STU
Look Im reaching up with my left
hand Im pushing against the
partition Its giving Im
feeling around with my fingertips
Its filthy up there

TIGHT SHOT - STUS FINGERS

feel about inside the shallow space The shriveled remains

of dead flies -- a layer of dust -- and then a 30 handgun
STU
Im -- touching something
VOICE

One of the finest handguns
Remington makes Lightweight
efficient and highly accurate

STU
Im not picking it up

VOICE
Not right now But eventually

Stu lowers his hand still empty

STU
I wouldnt have a chance

VOICE
I never said you would

STU
Im not insane

VOICE
But youre getting there It
wouldnt take much

STU
That wont happen

VOICE
You could pull the gun down shove
it in your own mouth and jerk the
trigger Thats another option
STU
Why would I do that

VOICE
To please me And ensure that
nothing happens to Kelly I dont
necessarily have to deal with her
today in the midst of a crowd of
cops I can take her out any time
I like When she goes to pull down
her blinds at night or when she
walks the dog first thing in the
morning What is it -- a Jack
Russell

STU
Okay I know you can do it But
dont talk about that Please

VOICE
Id rather see you remembered as
he gallant gunman who tried to
hoot his way past an army of
olice -- than as a coward who
ucked the barrel Im doing your
R for you Creating a final image
hatll endure The outraged New
orker who was pushed too far
hen some lowlife street person
ries to invade his territory he
etaliated And when the forces of
he law closed in he was
defiant to the end

tahoe eK at vevod

STU
Like that nerdy sonofabitch who
blew those three wiseass kids away
on the subway

VOICE
Exactly Nobody minded that he was
a sicko He was living out a New
Yorkers pet fantasy Can you
remember that movie where Peter
Finch started screaming Im not
taking it anymore And everybody
picked up on it

STU
‘Im mad as hell and Im not taking
it anymore
VOICE
That was it Poor Finch got
himself an Oscar for that But he
was dead by then I mean he really
died Maybe playing that part took
too much out of him

STU
(softly to himself)
Im not taking it anymore ‘Im

not taking it anymore

VOICE
Thats the way Psyche yourself
up Everybody respects a man who
fights back even if he goes a
little berserk in the process

STU
Fighting back Thats what its
about

VOICE

Exactly We all understand the
poor schmuck that gets laid off and
comes back and shoots all his
bosses We all thought of doing
that But only he had the balls
The terminally ill husband who gets
his policy canceled and machine
guns the insurance company offices
Maybe somebody will finally get the
message You can fuck human beings
over only for so long before they
come back at you Im still
holding on Kelly and she looks very
concerned I could relieve all
that anguish in a fraction of a
second Shall I

Stu is hearing these words but thinking only of what the man
on the line has done to him His turn has come to fight
back He has an idea

If the sniper is focused on Kelly he cant be watching Stu

Turning his back to the police Stu slowly sinks to his
knees

STU
Im on my knees begging you
VOICE
Stand up Stu Youre embarrassing
yourself

TIGHT ANGLE --

Stu now down on his knees in the booth Hes curled up
almost into a fetal position

By doing so he hopes to hide the fact that hes reaching
into his pants pocket and pulling out his cellular phone

He half expects to hear a shot ring out either from the
sniper or the cops But nothing happens

VOICE
Stu -- I want you back on your feet
facing me So you can see what Im
going to do to her

Stu ignores the command Hes quickly dialing

Hes calling police emergency

SNIPERS POV

Stu seen through the cross hairs of the sniperscope

crouched doubled up at the foot of the booth But the cell
phone is hidden in front of him

VOICE
Be a man Stuart Dont let them
see you like this Youre an

embarrassment to me
WIDER SHOT - THE BOOTH
with Stu still kneeling

RACK FOCUS
to police across the street as their voices become clear --

SERGEANT
(listening to
transmission)
Officer on east side of the street
reports subject removed a dark
metallic object from his pocket
We better move

RAMEY
Hold all fire until you actually
identify a weapon Were doing
this on fucking TV

RACK FOCUS BACK TO -- STU IN THE BOOTH

crouched forward The pay phone receiver dangles just above
his head The cellular remains cupped in his hand

Stu never lifts the cell phone He keeps the palm of his
hand over the speaker of the phone to muffle any sound from
the other end

It rings and finally someone answers

EMERGENCY OPERATOR
(faint)
Police Is this an emergency
Hello Is someone on the line

But Stu addresses himself loudly to the pay phone which he
now grips in his other hand Hoping that his words will be
picked up by the emergency operator listening via the
cellular To help in this regard he reaches back and slides
the door to the booth tightly closed

He pretends to be talking to the sniper but his words are
meant for the 911 operator to hear

STU
(loud)
Youve made your point Whos
going to believe Ive got a sniper
with a telescopic sight holding me
in a fucking phone booth at 45th

and 8th

VOICE
It took you a while to believe it
yourself

STU

If youd put a bullet in that
Captain Ramey it wouldve been a
different story -- but you were too
wise to do that

VOICE
Why dont you do it for me Wave
the old captain back over and get
him nice and close and then use the
handgun on him

STU

(talking loud)
Why me You could pick off any of
those cops from your window up
there Like you did that pimp
And that tourist last week But
this time you want me to do your
killing for you

VOICE
And you will To save Kelly

EXTREME TIGHT SHOT - CELL PHONE

cupped in Stus hand and held low Can they hear him on the
other end

EMERGENCY OPERATOR
(muffled almost
inaudible)
Can you speak up sir What is
your name

Stu is concerned that the sniper might hear the voice of the
emergency operator He sets the cell phone down flat on the
floor of the booth facing upward He puts his foot over the
receiving end to muffle the incoming voice Then he stands
up

VOICE
Thats better Stu Now turn
around so I can see you

Stu talks close into the pay phone receiver now But keeps
his voice raised

STU
This booth Its my whole world --
shrunk down to four feet by three
feet Not much bigger than the
size of a coffin

VOICE
They can put handles on the booth
and bury you in it

STU
(loudly into pay phone)
When I saw you put that bullet into
that black dude I knew youd never
let me out of this phone booth
alive

VOICE
Youre wasting my time Reach up
and take the gun

STU
(peering upward
squinting)
Let me see you first What harm
can that do you Youre in one of
those windows Ive got to know
which one

VOICE
No need for that

STU
Being so far I could never
identify you I dont even want
to

VOICE
What is it then

STU
Dont worry that Id try to point
you out Youd shut me up with one
of your 30 calibre hollow points
before I could even raise a finger

VOICE
Why does it matter so much

STU
I want to see that you exist Like
God exists Its not enough to
believe You want to see him --
just once -- even at a distance
VOICE

And then youd take the gun down
And use it We have a deal on
that

STU
Show yourself to me and Ill take
the gun down I swear
Theres a pause as the sniper mulls it over

VOICE
I dont have to make deals And
youre irritating me by trying to
negotiate God doesnt have to
prove anything He just strikes
you down when he gets in the mood

STU
Stop I wont ask to see you
anymore

VOICE

Im glad thats settled But look
who else has showed up

STU
Who

VOICE
I guess she saw the coverage on TV
and just couldnt keep away

STU
What are you talking about

VOICE
The hotel just arrived Anda
very beautiful little hotel she is
Actually Id classify her as more
of a motel

STU
Mavis I dont see her

VOICE
Shes too far back behind the
police line But Ive got a fine
shot at her from up here

STU
You dont even know what she looks
like

VOICE

Youre in an enviable position now
Stu You get to choose between
them Tell me which one

STU
I cant
VOICE
Which will it be Kelly or Mavis
Or should I simply select one

INSERT SHOT - THE CELL PHONE

lying face up on the floor of the booth Is anybody
listening

BACK TO STU

Stu looks down at the cellular He has no way of knowing if
the police operator can hear any of his words

STU
I need time to think

VOICE
Youve got to be more in touch with
your feelings You said you love
Kelly

STU
do

VOICE
Then Im doing you a favor putting
you out of the way of temptation

fq

STU
t wasnt Mavis fault It was all
my fault
VOICE

Then take the third option Reach
above you and pick up the gun

STU
Youll leave them both alone

VOICE
There wont be much point in
harming them without you around to
impress

sTU
Ill do it

VOICE
Let me see you do it
STU
I need one minute One last
minute please Can you give me
that

VOICE
Dont tell me youre going to say
your prayers

STU
Something like that

WE RACK FOCUS AWAY TO LONG SHOT - THE POLICE
assembled on the opposite side of the street

RAMEY
They shouldve traced the fucking
call by now

SERGEANT
(listening on transmitter)
Theres something else coming in
A 911 operator says your name was
mentioned by somebody thats still
on the line Somebody talking
about a phone booth And a sniper

RAMEY
Patch me through Hello this is
Captain Edward Ramey What about
that call

EMERGENCY OPERATOR
The line is still open Its
originating from a booth at 45th
and 8th

RAMEY
Were there Can you play me back
your recording of the entire call

EMERGENCY OPERATOR
I cant replay the tape while its
still running

RAMEY
Then switch to another machine and
play back what youve got

EMERGENCY OPERATOR
Its awful faint Hes not talking
directly into the receiver

Ramey begins to listen We hear snatches of Stus call
picking up words which are at times incomprehensible

STUS VOICE
(faint)
‘Whos going to believe Ive got a
sniper with a telescopic sight
holding me in some fucking phone
booth

The uniformed TELEPHONE TECHNICIAN now joins Ramey and the
Sergeant

TELEPHONE TECHNICIAN
Got what you wanted The calls
coming from up the street The
Hotel Broadway

RAMEY
Have you got the room

TELEPHONE TECHNICIAN
Its not that easy Electronic
switchboard

RAMEY
(to Sergeant)
Move your SWAT units to the hotel
No wait Any movement will
alert the sniper If he sees any
of us withdraw he may panic

SERGEANT
Theres another SWAT unit on the
way

RAMEY
Intercept them Divert them to the
hotel

SERGEANT
Its done

RAMEY
Send them in from the Forty-third
Street side I dont want any

activity the sniper might catch
sight of Hes probably high up
and facing that booth Hes got to
continue to believe our full
attention is focused on the man
inside -- whoever the hell that
poor bastard is

(to emergency operator)
Hello 911 operator I missed some
of that Run it halfway back and
repeat it

STUS VOICE (REPLAY)
(faint)
Like you did that pimp And
that tourist last week But this
time you want me to do the killing

for you
RAMEY
(listening)
Jesus hes a dead man

BACK INSIDE PHONE BOOTH

VOICE
The police seem all excited about
something Stu

STU
Are they I wasnt looking

VOICE
I cant wait any longer Say amen
then reach up for the gun When
your hand comes down I want to see

it
STU
Im too afraid
VOICE
For once be brave Surprise
yourself
STU

Im shaking all over

VOICE
Guys in combat situations even shit
their pants But they follow
orders

STU
As soon as the cops see a gun
theyll open fire
VOICE
Then Id advise you to fire first

Stus arm goes up in a supreme act of willpower

His fingers run along the two clouded plastic sheets that
cover the roof of the booth It raises up easily at the
middle where two sheets join

TIGHT INSERT SHOT

The space between the roof of the booth and the sheets of

clouded plastic We see the fluorescent lighting fixture

covered with dust The solitary object -- a cruel-looking
weapon

Now Stus fingertips protrude into the small space He
touches the gun brushes back and forth feeling the
roughness of the grip

TIGHT SHOT - STUS FACE
as below he continues to hesitate -- its agony --

The sweat pours down his forehead and his eyes are squeezed
tightly shut He can already imagine the police bullets
tearing into him

A POLICE SNIPER IS MOVING INTO POSITION

POLICE SNIPER
(into transmitter)
Give me the word

RACK BACK TO STU - IN THE BOOTH

His arm still raised He hasnt brought it down with the gun
in it Not yet He holds the pay phone receiver jammed up
against his mouth

VOICE
Hard parts over Drop your arm
and point it like youd point your
finger and squeeze

STU
No You do it If you want me
dead then fucking murder me

VOICE
Why must I keep invoking some poor
girls name every time we come to
an impasse Im focused back on
Kelly again Youre obviously not
willing to trade your life for
hers

STU
I am Im doing it

He pulls the handgun down into full view Curiously the
police do not open fire

STU
There You see it They all see
it
He waves the gun so nobody can miss it

STU
Where are you Damn you

He drops the receiver and steps halfway out of the booth
Still the cops do not open fire
Then Stu starts shooting

Not at the police but at the high rise buildings across the
street

At the thousands of windows that look down upon him

He gets off two shots before a solitary rifle shot rings out
in response

RACK FOCUS TO THE POLICE SNIPER

He has fired

ANGLE ON STU

The remaining glass on the south side of the booth shatters
Stu tumbles forward sprawling out of the booth onto the
pavement

RACK FOCUS TO KELLY

She screams tries to break through but cops restrain her

INT PHONE BOOTH

ANGLE ON DANGLING RECEIVER
as it sways back and forth From it we hear the voice

VOICE
Thanks for such an interesting
afternoon

THEN THERE ARE OTHER SOUNDS EMANATING FROM THE DANGLING
SWAYING PHONE

A wooden door being battered open A few incomprehensible
shouts as a SWAT TEAM dashes in Stus stalling for time has
paid off

THE SOUND OF A BARRAGE OF GUNFIRE
THE SOUND OF A MUFFLED SCREAM

The police have broken in on Stus tormentor and there has
been a rapid exchange of shots

A HAND reaches into the booth and grabs the receiver
ANGLE WIDENS as Ramey places it to his ear

RAMEY
Hello This is Captain Ramey
Somebody talk to me

SWAT OFFICERS VOICE
Yeah We took him out Captain
Nobody else got hurt

RAMEY
Whats his condition

SWAT OFFICERS VOICE
Critical The sonofabitch took
two Probably wont survive the
ride

RAMEY
Get a statement from him Ill be
right over

He drops the receiver so that it dangles again

CAMERA FOLLOWS RAMEY to where Stu lies surrounded by cops and
medics Hes stunned but very much alive

MEDIC
Dont try to sit up
STU
What was that

RAMEY
(kneeling)
Rubber bullet

MEDIC
Youll have one hell of a nasty
welt Busted rib Maybe a
permanent scar there

STU
It couldnt hurt much more if you
really shot me

RAMEY
Somebody was going to and we
thought it may as well be us

STU
Did you get him

RAMEY
Sure as hell did Thanks to you

STU
Still alive

RAMEY
Barely

MEDIC

Well be giving him a hypo for the
pain Itll put him out fora
while

Kelly is now brought over by a female cop She drops to her
knees beside Stu and tries to embrace him The medics
restrain her

STU
Its okay Im not really shot

KELLY
I was so afraid I thought

STU
I thought so too But were going
to be alright Both of us
KELLY
Remember how you swore up and down
youd get me on TV Well you did
I already got interviewed on Fox
and Channel Eleven and they even
want me on AM America tomorrow
morning

STU
Bet you didnt think I could
deliver on that

MEDIC
Will you please let go of him
Miss

A gurney is wheeled over from a police ambulance The medic
is about to administer the hypo but Stu pushes him away

STU
No No hypo I want to see him
first

The medics are now ready to lift Stu onto the gurney and cart
him off But Stu struggles against them

RAMEY
Relax The guys dying

STU
Thats why Ive gotta talk to him
Please

RAMEY
Well see

MEDIC
(to Kelly)
You can ride with him in the
ambulance

The woman cop escorts Kelly to the waiting ambulance

Ramey meanwhile tries to resume contact with the SWAT team
inside the hotel

RAMEY
This is Ramey Over This is
Ramey Ten-Four

Theres nothing but static mixed up feedback and multiple
garbled voices on the other end of the line
RAMEY
Shit Get everybody off this
wavelength

He crosses back to the phone booth -- picks up the dangling
receiver

RAMEY
Hello Hello Pick up Yeah
its Ramey again Can you hold the
phone close enough so the perp can
listen

COPS VOICE
Hes not saying a word Captain

RAMEY
Hes not about to talk to us
Maybe to him

Ramey looks back to where the medics are still trying to lift
Stu onto the gurney

RAMEY
Forget that Stand him up
(to Stu)
Can you stand

STU
I can try

RAMEY
Help him over here

The medics support Stu and inch him back to the booth Its
painful but Stu ignores it

Ramey holds the phone up so Stu can both listen and speak

RAMEY
Here Speak up

STU
(into pay phone)
Its me Do you hear me Answer

VOICE
(wheezing)
Had to have the last word Stu
STU
I finally beat your ass Admit it

VOICE
But youll never forget me I gave
you the most thrilling day of your
life Say thanks

STU
Now youre gonna die you bastard

VOICE
I lost a lot of blood Dont you
want to donate some for me Then
wed really be part of each other

STU
Hang on I cant wait to see you
at the hospital So I can yank
your fucking air tube out

VOICE
Wish I could give you that
pleasure You deserve it
(coughing)
Only Im out of time

STU
Whats your name At least tell me
who you are

Theres more violent coughing then silence Then a cops
voice is heard

COPS VOICE
Hes gone

Stu stares at the receiver

RAMEY
Dont worry Well find out who he
is And why he picked you

STU
No You wont
(a beat)
What do you want to bet you wont

Stu reaches over and hangs up the receiver CLICK

sTU
Ill spend my whole life trying to
figure that out

Then he sinks into the arms of the medics who lower him onto
the waiting gurney

The hypo is finally administered It kicks in immediately
relieving the pain

Hes wheeled away from the booth to the waiting ambulance
Kelly is already inside waiting to accompany Stu to the
hospital

STUS POV - BEING WHEELED AWAY FROM THE EMPTY BOOTH
pulling away in LOW ANGLE

CAMERA SLIDES BACK inside the ambulance with Stu The doors
shut obliterating our view of the phone booth that was his
entire world until moments ago

sTU
(groggy)

Gotta sleep now No phone calls

Kelly smiles down at him as the image blurs Stu passes out
-- into a deep sleep he much deserves

A SIREN BLARES

CUT TO BLACK
