It is the mid 22nd Century Mankind
has explored the boundaries of his
own solar system and now he reaches
out to the endless interstellar
distances of the universe He moves
away from his own small planetary
system in huge hyperdrive starships
computer-driven self-supporting
closed-system spacecraft that travel
at mind-staggering post-light
velocities Man has begun to spread
among the stars Enormous ships
embark with generations of colonists
searching the depths of space for
new earths now homes new
beginnings Far in advance of these
colony ships goes a new pioneer the
scouts the pathfinders a special
breed of man who has dedicated his
life to blazing the trail through
the most distant unexplored
galaxies opening up the farthest
frontiers of space These are the
men of the Advance Exploration
Corps The task they face is one of
unbelievable isolation and
loneliness So far from home that

This is a chain-reaction bomb
otherwise known as an Exponential
Thermostellar Device Its own
destructive power is small barely
enough to vaporize twelve city
blocks However when it explodes in
contact with an object the size of a
planet it starts a chain-reaction
in the very matter of that planet
turning it into a giant reactor
which destroys itself in one
staggering thermal flash

These bombs are equipped with
sophisticated thought and speech
mechanisms to allow them to make
executive decisions in the event of
a crisis situation These judgment
centers are controlled by a fail-
safe mechanism

Well it is kind of a long shot

DOOLITTLE
Its a goddamn wild goose chase
Remember when Commander Powell found
that 99 plus probability of sentient
life in the Magellanic Cloud

Talby
Talby rotates his seat and looks down at Doolittle

DOOLITTLE
(contd)
Heres some breakfast

Doolittle climbs into the dome and sits on the floor He hands
Talby

the food package and watches matter-of-factly as Talby begins to
eat

DOOLITTLE
(contd)
You know Talby you really ought to
eat with the rest of us You spend
too much time up here

TALBY
I like it up here

DOOLITTLE
Must get lonely being up here so
much

TALBY

I dont like to go below since
Commander Powell died I feel
enclosed down there If it were big
enough Id sleep up here

DOOLITTLE
Should spend some time below see
more of the rest of the ship

TALBY
You see I can watch things up
here Doolittle I love to watch
things just stare at the planets
and meteors and asteroids gas
clusters

DOOLITTLE
Youll have plenty of time for that
you know Figure it this way twenty
years in space and weve only aged
three so therell be plenty of time
to stare around

TALBY
You know Doollttle if were going
into the Veil Nebula we may
actually find a strange and
beautiful thing the Phoenix
Asteroids They should be passing
through there about now

DOOLITTLE
Phoenix Asteroids Never heard of
em

TALBY
hey are a body of asteroids that
ake a complete circuit of the
niverse once every 123 trillion
ears The Phoenix Asteroids From
hat Ive heard Doolittle they
low glow with all the colors of
he rainbow Nobody knows why They
ust glow as they drift around the
niverse Imagine all the sights
heyve seen in the time theyve
been travelling -- the birth and
death of stars things well never
see The universe is alive
Doolittle I thought it was all
empty but it isnt In between the
stars its seething with light and
gasses and dust There are little
pebbles drifting around planets no
one on Earth has ever seen No one
but the Phoenix Asteroids

There is a BLIPPING SOUND It is insistent Talby is rudely
yanked
from his reverie He looks down at a panel But his soft talk
has

started Doolittle reminiscing

DOOLITTLE
You know what I think about Talby

TALBY
Im getting something here on this
readout

DOOLITTLE

Its funny but I kind of sit
around you know a lot of time to
myself

TALBY
I think Im getting a malfunction
here somewhere
Talby turns in

DOOLITTLE
I cant talk to the others but with
time to myself I think about back
home back home at Malibu I used to
surf a lot Talby I used to bea
great surfer

TALBY
Lieutenant Doolittle Im getting a
definite malfunction on one of the
closed-circuit computer systems

DOOLITTLE
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were
fantastic in the springs Talby I
can remember running out on the
beach early spring mornings with my
board and a wet suit

TALBY
I cant seem to locate the
malfunction exactly

DOOLITTLE
Waves would be peaking really high
and glassy Hit that water Ridin
the wall just perfect

TALBY
Somewhere in the autonomic relay
circuits

DOOLITTLE
I guess I miss the waves and my
board most of all

his seat and addresses Doolittle directly

TALBY
Ah Doolittle I do have a
malfunction on this readout but I
cant seem to pinpoint exactly where
it is

DOOLITTLE
(snapped out of his
daydream)
Dont worry about it Well find out
when it goes bad

TALBY
(chagrined)
I really think I should try and
locate it immediately Might be
something important

DOOLITTLE

I wish I had my board with me now
Even if I could only polish it once
in awhile

MISSION CONTROLLER
Hi guys Glad to get your message
We gather from the ten-year
communications lag that you are
approximately 18 parsecs away Drop
us a line more often wont you

Sorry to hear about all the
malfunctions and real sorry to hear
about the death of Commander Powell
There was a week of mourning all
over Earth The flags were at half
mast

Now I hate to send bad news when you
guys are up there doing such a swell
job but somethings come up and we
all felt you ought to know about it
Our systems simulation computer has
predicted that by the time this
message reaches you -- that is to
say in about ten years -- there
will be a failure in one of your
vital ships systems The

malfunction will occur in --
(rifles papers)

-- system number E180246 You can

see what a problem this would be if

you didnt catch it on time Now

what you should do is this First

detonation

INTERIOR - VENTRAL AIR LOCK

Wearing his starsuit complete with jetpack Doolittle pushes a
button Above him the giant lock doors slowly slide open

EXTERIOR - SHIP
Doolittle slowly rises up out of the ship He stops his ascent
with

his jetpack turns and moves down toward the bomb bay

INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM

PINBACK
Doolittle Doolittle what the hell
are you doing

EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY

Doolittle floats into shot jets himself up until he is facing

massive
Bomb 20

DOOLITTLE
Hello bomb are you with me

BOMB 20
Of course

DOOLITTLE
Are you willing to entertain a few
concepts

BOMB 20
I am always receptive to
suggestions

DOOLITTLE
Fine Think about this one then
how do you know you exist

INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM

BOILER
Whats he doin

PINBACK
I think hes talking to it

EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY

BOMB 20
Well of course I exist

DOOLITTLE
But how do you know you exist

BOMB 20
It is intuitively obvious

DOOLITTLE
Intuition is no proof What concrete
evidence do you have of your own

existence

BOMB 20
Hmm Well I think therefore I
am

DOOLITTLE

Thats good Very good Now then
how do you know that anything else

exists
BOMB 20
My sensory apparatus reveals it to
me
DOOLITTLE
Right
BOMB 20
This is fun
DOOLITTLE

All right now heres the big
question how do you know that the
evidence your sensory apparatus
reveals to you is correct
INTERIOR - EMERGENCY AIR LOCK

Talby lies unconscious near the burned laser

EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY

DOOLITTLE
What Im getting at is this the
only experience that is directly
available to you is your sensory
data And this data is merely a
stream of electrical impulses which
stimulate your computing center

BOMB 20
In other words all I really know
about the outside universe relayed
to me through my electrical

connections

DOOLITTLE
Exactly

BOMB 20
Why that would mean I really

dont know what the outside universe
is like at all for certain

DOOLITTLE
Thats it

BOMB 20
Intriguing I wish I had more time
to discuss this matter

DOOLITTLE
Why dont you have more time

BOMB 20
Because I must detonate in seventy-
five seconds

INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM

BOILER
The key

PINBACK
Key Key What is the key

BOILER
No no the key the key to the
fail-safe lock

PINBACK
Key

BOILER
Wheres the fail-safe key

PINBACK
The key

BOILER
Where is it What did you do with
it

PINBACK
I dont have it I dont know where
it is

BOILER

You must have it you idiot we can
stop the bomb

EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY

DOOLITTLE
Now bomb consider this next
question very carefully What is
your one purpose in life

BOMB 20
To explode of course

DOOLITTLE
And you can only do it once right

BOMB 20
That is correct

DOOLITTLE
And you wouldnt want to explode on
the basis of false data would you

BOMB 20
Of course not

DOOLITTLE
Well then youve already admitted
that you have no real proof of the
existence of the outside universe

BOMB 20
Yes well

DOOLITTLE
So you have no absolute proof that
Sergeant Pinback ordered you to
detonate

BOMB 20
I recall distinctly the detonation
order My memory is good on matters
like these

DOOLITTLE
Yes of course you remember it but
what you are remembering is merely a
series of electrical impulses which
you now realize have no necessary
connection with outside reality

BOMB 20
True but since this is so I have
no proof that you are really telling
me all this

INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM

Pinback is pawing frantically through the control room searching
for
the key Boiler is apoplectic

BOILER
The key goddamit the key

PINBACK
Christ twenty seconds Christ

BOILER
Where is the key

PINBACK
Were gonna die Boiler Were gonna
die

They begin slapping each other hysterically

EXTERIOR - BOMB BAY

DOOLITTLE
Thats all beside the point The
concepts are valid wherever they
originate
BOMB 20

DOOLITTLE
So if you detonate in

BOMB 20
nine seconds

DOOLITTLE
» you may be doing so on the basis
of false data

BOMB 20
I have no proof that it was false
data

DOOLITTLE

You have no proof that it was
correct data

There is a long pause

BOMB 20
I must think on this further

THE BOMB RAISES ITSELF BACK INTO THE SHIP Doolittle practically
collapses with relief

Whoa

Talby upside down is falling in the opposite direction

TALBY
Doolittle Doolittle where are you

DOOLITTLE
Here I am I think Im spinning
Were both falling Talby in
opposite directions away from each

P

ipper He made it Commander
owell made it

A block of ice with a mans body in it tumbles past end over
end

POWELL
(weakly)
Men men what happened men

DOOLITTLE
Yeah the skipper always was lucky

The planet begins to rise behind Doolittle

DOOLITTLE
(contd)
Looks like Im headed for the
planet Talby Going right toward
it

TALBY
When you fall Doolittle if theres
anyone down there on the planet
somebody may see you They may see
you coming down What a beautiful
way to die as a falling star

DOOLITTLE
Guess youre right
Talby turns his head and looks behind him

TALBY
Doolittle Im heading right toward
something Its behind me in the
distance Something that glows

Far behind Talby coming nearer is a shimmering point of light

DOOLITTLE
Oh yeah
TALBY
Doolittle I think its the Phoenix
Asteroids
DOOLITTLE
Phoenix

The point of light is closer now and it has begun to
differentiate
into a group of beautifully colored frost-like shapes

TALBY
It is Doolittle its the Phoenix
They glow with all the colors of the
rainbow just like everybody said

DOOLITTLE
No kidding

TALBY
Im going into them Im going to
hit them Doolittle

DOOLITTLE
Yeah

TALBY
Before we get too far away and our
signals start to fade I just wanted
to tell you you were my favorite
I really liked you Doolittle

DOOLITTLE
I really liked you too Talby Hey
some debris from the ship Its
coming right by me

Several chunks of debris from the ship drift past Doolittle

TALBY
Doolittle Im catching up to the
asteroids Im going to be a part of
them in a minute Doolittle Im
going into them

Talby drifts into the huge frost-like shapes expanding and
glowing

and spinning slowly refracting all the colors of the spectrum
witha

cold glow

TALBY
(contd)
Im beginning to glow

The field of spectral shapes with Talby in their midst begin to
drift away into the distance

TALBY

(contd)
Theyre taking me with them with
the Phoenix going to circle the
universe forever Im with them
now be back this way again some
day Doolittle before its too
late theres one last thing I
want to tell you

Talbys signal dies out as the glowing lights disappear into the
depths of space

Doolittle is hanging onto a long thin chunk of debris
DOOLITTLE
Hey Talby Ive grabbed a piece of
the ship and I think Ive figured

out a way

He pulls the piece of metal down beneath his feet and stands on
it

Crouching and extending his arms Doolittle surfs down into the
atmosphere of the planet banking and planing as he disappears to

small dot
