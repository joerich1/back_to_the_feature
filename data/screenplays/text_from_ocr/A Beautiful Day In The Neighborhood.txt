A BEAUTIFUL DAY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

Written by

“Can You Say Hero”
by Tom Junod
A MINIATURE RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

Colorful BALSAWOOD HOUSES and PLASTIC TREES pepper the
boulevards MODEL CARS wait for the passing toy TROLLEY

A familiar VIBRAPHONE chimes in
Up ahead a quaint YELLOW HOUSE comes into focus

We are in the opening credits of MISTER ROGERS’ NEIGHBORHOOD

INT MISTER ROGERS’ NEIGHBORHOOD HOME - CONTINUOUS

FRED ROGERS swings open the door beaming He sings directly
into the camera His movements are slow -- he’s not as young
as he once was

FRED (SINGING)
Its a beautiful day in this
neighborhood A beautiful day for a
neighbor Would you be mine Could
you be mine

At the closet Fred takes off his sport coat and hangs it up

FRED (SINGING) (CONTD)
Its a neighborly day in this
beauty wood A neighborly day for a
beauty Would you be mine Could
you be mine

He plucks a RED CARDIGAN off the hanger

FRED (SINGING) (CONTD)
Ive always wanted to have a
neighbor just like you

Fred points right into the camera You

FRED (SINGING) (CONTD)
Ive always wanted to live ina
neighborhood with you So lets
make the most of this beeeeautiful
day

He playfully zips up the sweater before sitting on the bench
FRED (SINGING) (CONTD)
Since were together we might as

well say

Repeating a ritual he has done for decades Fred slips off
his DRESS SHOE and tosses it to his other hand
He replaces it with the BLUE BOAT SHOE and ties it tight
before moving on to the next foot

FRED (SINGING) (CONTD)
Would you be mine could you be
mine Wont you be my neighbor
Wont you please wont you please
Please wont you be my neighbor

He smiles and settles in Then that soft warm voice

FRED (CONTD)
Hello neighbor So good to see you
again today

Fred pulls out a large WOODEN BOARD checkered with several
little patterned DOORS

FRED (CONTD)
Do you see the special thing that I
brought in to show you It’s called
a picture board because behind
each one of these little doors is a
picture of people Look who this
one is

Fred opens a door to reveal a soft-focus headshot of LADY
ABERLIN 40s

FRED (CONTD)
It’s Lady Aberlin Let’s see who’s
behind this door

He opens another -- this time it’s the KING FRIDAY puppet

FRED (CONTD)
It’s King Friday the thirteenth --
with his crown and mustache and
beard What’s behind here

Fred opens another door It’s MISTER MCFEELY 50s in a white
wig goatee and hat

FRED (CONTD)
It’s Mister McFeely He says
“speedy delivery” doesn’t he
(then )
Today I’d like you to meet a new
friend of mine named Lloyd Vogel

He opens the last door It’s LLOYD VOGEL 35 He’s got a FAT
BLOODY LIP
FRED (CONTD)
Someone has hurt my friend Lloyd
and not just on his face He is
having a hard time forgiving the
person who hurt him Do you know
what it means to forgive

Fred waits for you to answer

FRED (CONTD)
It is a decision we make to release
a person from the feelings of anger
we have at them It’s strange but
sometimes it’s hardest of all to
forgive someone we love

Fred smiles
FRED (CONTD)

Let’s go say hello to my new friend
Lloyd shall we

Fred heads toward the front door and waves for us to come
along --

The VIBRAPHONE chimes carry us out the window and into --

THE MINIATURE NEIGHBORHOOD

The same houses cars trees and trolley -- in reverse

We expand out to reveal much more than just Mister Rogers’
Neighborhood

Now we see all of --

MINIATURE PITTSBURGH

And we’re over the bridges and rivers past the Monongahela
Incline over the trees and mountains into --

MINIATURE NEW YORK CITY

We stop over NEW YORK CITY as the sun sets

The city lights flicker on and the sounds of life in
Manhattan bring us into --
MINIATURE PLAZA HOTEL

The historic art-deco masterpiece glows in the moonlight

EXT PLAZA HOTEL - NIGHT

INT PLAZA HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT

A lavish black-tie awards dinner celebrating the NATIONAL

The GLAMOROUS CROWD of journalists applaud as Lloyd gets up
from his seat and approaches the podium

ELLEN 50 his long-time editor looks on

LLOYD
Thank you It’s so wonderful to be
here tonight with my fellow
misfits We clean up good

Chuckles
Lloyd looks to the teleprompter then --

LLOYD (CONTD)
So why do we write for magazines
for a living Because doing
anything else doesn’t seem quite
like living at all We get a front
row seat to history We get to
expose the truth that others cannot
see And sometimes just sometimes
we get to change a broken world
with our words

APPLAUSE takes us to --

EXT LLOYD’S BUILDING - STREET - LATE NIGHT

Lloyd exits a cab in front of his building
INT LLOYD’S LOFT - THE NEXT MORNING

Sunlight fills the airy home Lloyd’s wife ANDREA 35 takes
a huge bite of a brioche

She’s in heaven

ANDREA
Mmmm

Lloyd places a handful of diapers on a pile of BABY CLOTHES
and GEAR He’s trying to pack GAVIN their four-month-old
sleeps in the rocker nearby

ANDREA (CONTD)
Thank you I needed this I ate a
block of cheese for dinner

Lloyd smiles then looks at the disorganized pile of clothes

LLOYD
So what are we forgetting

ANDREA
We definitely need more diapers

LLOYD
More than this We’re just going to
Jersey for one night

ANDREA
We go through at least twelve a
day

LLOYD

We do What are you feeding that
kid Wouldn’t it be easier to just
leave him with a sitter We could --

ANDREA
You know I’m not ready to leave him
with a stranger He’s too little

LLOYD
Yeah

ANDREA
Hey so your sister called last
night

LLOYD

Uh huh
ANDREA
She wanted to make sure youd
written your toast

LLOYD
Oh I’m all set I’m just gonna use
my speech from her first wedding
Or maybe from her second

ANDREA

Okay sure Just change the names

They share a smile She’s suddenly serious

ANDREA (CONTD)
And hey She wanted me to tell you
something

LLOYD
Okay

ANDREA
Your father is coming

Lloyd goes silent

ANDREA (CONTD)
I guess she reached out months ago
and didn’t think he would respond
but he called and he’s coming to
the wedding

LLOYD
Oh

ANDREA
You okay

Lloyd pulls it together

LLOYD
Yeah Fine
(then slightly jokey)
But I don’t think we should go

ANDREA
Lloyd

LLOYD
What Seriously -- why have a baby
if you can’t use him to get out
social engagements
ANDREA
That’s what Lorraine’s afraid of --
that you’1ll back out

LLOYD
I’m kidding I would never miss her
wedding I look forward to them
every year

Andrea laughs

ANDREA
Okay Well I think it’ll be nice
for Gavin to meet his grandfather

LLOYD
Sure

Lloyd is distracted

Andrea studies him worried

EXT STREET - DAY

A TAXI CAB idles Andrea bounces Gavin on the sidewalk

In the back of the car Lloyd tries to install a baby seat
Lloyd SHOVES the car seat HARD seeping stress

LLOYD
Dammit

ANDREA
(to Gavin)
Daddy’s just being funny
Lloyd gives the car seat a shake It’s completely unattached

LLOYD
It’s impossible

ANDREA
Here Take him Here

Andrea offers Gavin to Lloyd He takes the baby and Andrea
climbs into the back seat

Lloyd bounces Gavin looking off into space not connected

Andrea jams her knee into the seat and CLICKS it into place
ANDREA (CONTD)
There

LLOYD
Great

The vibraphone takes us to --

MINIATURE TRI-STATE AREA

The NEW YORK SKYLINE and the HUDSON RIVER

We dip down toward I-95 where the TAXI moves North toward

INT RADISSON RECEPTION HALL - DAY

A modest sparsely attended affair

TODD 35 the doughy and blue collar groom waits by the RENT-
A-REVEREND

Lloyd and Andrea sit near the back Gavin is asleep on Andrea
in a carrier

ANDREA
(re Todd)
He looks terrified
LLOYD
He should be He’s marrying
Lorraine

The music changes

The small crowd STANDS and TURNS to see LORRAINE VOGEL 35
in a slinky white dress

Escorting Lorraine is JERRY VOGEL 65 tan with pomade in his
hair and a flashy blazer

Jerry waves at Lloyd -- a big ratpack grin

ANDREA
Breathe

Lloyd quickly looks away

INT RADISSON BAR - LATER - NIGHT

Wedding music blasts

Lorraine and Todd approach Lloyd and Andrea at their table

ANDREA
(to Lorraine)
Oh my you look so beautiful

LLOYD
Absolutely

LORRAINE
I’m ten pounds short of my target
weight but whatever --

He notices Todd the groom

LLOYD
Hey I’m Lloyd The brother

TODD
I know man I guess I’m Todd you
know the husband

Todd swallows Lloyd in a bro-hug
Lorraine squeezes Gavin’s foot

LORRAINE
And look at you ya little peanut
(then )
I don’t think we’re having kids

Lloyd notices Jerry on the other side of the room He’s
talking to DOROTHY 55 wearing heavy make-up and a low-cut
dress

LLOYD
How’d that happen

LORRAINE
I invited him and he came

LLOYD
To walk you down the aisle Really

LORRAINE
He offered He missed the first
two I thought ‘why the hell not’

LLOYD
I can think of a few reasons

LORRAINE
He’s old and if he’s gonna make an
effort --

Jerry takes the mic at the stage Lloyd’s face falls

JERRY
Oh I guess it’s time we get this
started So in lieu of the typical
father of the bride speech I
thought I’d -- well I’d like to
sing a little ditty

The music starts

JERRY (CONTD)
This one is for my Lorraine -- and
for you too --

Jerry leans over to Dorothy searching for his name then --

JERRY (CONTD)
Todd

Jerry sings “Somethin’ Stupid” while Lorraine and Todd move
to the center to slow dance

Jerry croons doing his best Sinatra

JERRY (SINGING) (CONTD)
I know I stand in line until you
think you have the time
To spend an evening with me
And if we go some place to dance I
know that theres a chance you will
be leaving with me --

ANDREA
Admit it Now you regret eloping

LLOYD
Of course he’s drunk

ANDREA
He can sing

JERRY (SINGING)
Then afterwards we drop into a
quiet little place-
And have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all by
saying something stupid
Like “I love you”

Jerry looks at Lorraine

JERRY (SINGING) (CONTD)
I love you

Then he trains his eyes on Lloyd

JERRY (SINGING) (CONTD)
I love you

INT BAR - CONTINUOUS

Lloyd hides away in a corner with Andrea and Gavin Jerry
bounds up

JERRY
Here we are In the pearl of the
Garden State --

LLOYD
Hello Jerry

JERRY
Come on You don’t have to call me
Jerry Or call me Jerry I don’t

Jerry trains his grin on Andrea and Gavin

JERRY (CONTD)
And hello to you

ANDREA

JERRY
Andrea Of course What a unique
pleasure
(to Gavin)
Hello little fella

ANDREA

JERRY

Andrea smiles
A very long very awkward beat

JERRY (CONTD)
Let’s have a drink

LLOYD
JERRY
What is that A pop That stuff’1l
kill you

LLOYD
I’m giving my toast then we’re
leaving so --

Jerry turns to Andrea

JERRY
Doll -- could you give us a moment

LLOYD
She’s not a doll She’s a public
interest attorney

JERRY

ANDREA

Lloyd gives Andrea a hard look Andrea mouths “breathe”

JERRY

Lloyd nods Yep

JERRY (CONTD)

LLOYD
I’m happy

JERRY
Well she seems nice enough
(then )
But aren’t you kinda old to have a
baby --

LLOYD
I’m not that old

JERRY
You’re smart Your mom and I hardly
knew each other when she got
pregnant We were babies

LLOYD
Don’t talk about her

Jerry grabs Lloyd’s arm tightly Lloyd tenses at the
constraint
JERRY
You don’t know the whole story
Your mom didn’t exactly-

Lloyd pulls himself away and decks Jerry

LLOYD
DON’T TALK ABOUT MY MOM

Todd grabs Lloyd before he can lunge at Jerry again

TODD
Whoa whoa whoa

LLOYD
Let go of me

Lloyd shoves Todd hard He SLAMS into Lorraine spilling red
wine all over her dress

LORRAINE
Stop Stop it

In the commotion a GROOMSMAN comes out of nowhere and DECKS
Lloyd

Suddenly everyone is scrapping
Dorothy runs in

DOROTHY
What the hell

Jerry tries to break them up and gets pushed back knocking
him against the windows

Blood dumps out onto Lloyd’s chin
Everything stops
Lloyd looks around the room

Silence

Lloyd’s eyes land on Andrea in disbelief Gavin’s screaming

EXT RADISSON - FRONT - MINUTES LATER

Andrea and Lloyd are mid-argument Lloyd holds a bloody bar
towel to his mouth

LLOYD
I shoulda known this would happen

ANDREA
It wasn’t inevitable It wasn’t
like “oh when these two see each
other somebody’s going to get
punched”

LLOYD
You didn’t hear him

ANDREA
You were out of control

LLOYD
He was out of control

ANDREA
So you’re going to take no
responsibility for what happened
LLOYD
Of course I am I offered to pay
for Lorraine’s dry cleaning

Andrea stares at him in disbelief

The VIBRAPHONE floats in with the melody of “What Do You Do
With The Mad That You Feel” --

We FREEZE and PUSH IN on Lloyd’s face -- his broken nose
swollen eye and split lip

BACK TO

INT MISTER ROGERS’ NEIGHBORHOOD HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

We pull out on the photo of that same face

Fred sits beside the big Wooden Board with little patterned
doors

He stares at Lloyd’s photo
FRED
Have you ever felt like Lloyd does
So angry you want to hurt someone
else or yourself I know I have

Fred smiles

FRED (CONTD)

When I was a boy I was very chubby
The other kids would chase me and
call me names -- like “Fat Freddy”
It made me very sad and I would cry
to myself And other times it made
me very angry

(then )
There is always something to do
with the mad you feel

There’s a knock at the door

FRED (CONTD)
Did you hear that

Another knock

FRED (CONTD)
Oh Someone is at my door Let’s go
see who it is

Fred looks out the window

FRED (CONTD)
It’s Mr McFeely

He opens the door

MR MCFEELY
Speedy Delivery

Mr McFeely hands Fred the mail

MR MCFEELY (CONTD)
Look It’s a magazine

In the bundle -- an ESQUIRE MAGAZINE He picks it up leafs
through it

FRED
Oh thank you Magazines are always
filled with all sorts of
interesting information

MR MCFEELY
They sure are

FRED
My friend Lloyd works for a
magazine He’s a very wonderful
writer
MR MCFEELY
That reminds me I have a video I
found and I thought you and your
neighbor may like to see it

FRED
What is it

MR MCFEELY
It’s about how people make a
magazine It’s called “How People
Make a Magazine” I know a lot of
people like magazines so I thought
you might find this interesting

FRED
I think we would -- do you have
time to show it to us now

MR MCFEELY
Id be glad to see it again

FRED
Let’s look at it on Picture
Picture

Mr McFeely takes the video out of the sleeve

MR MCFEELY
Here’s the tape

Fred takes the tape and slides it in the wall by the
painting

FRED
Well watch it on Picture Picture
and see how people make a magazine

In the painting a large scale PRINTING FACILITY

We push INTO the frame --

INT PRINTING FACILITY - DAY

A TECHNICIAN globs yellow ink onto a roller

MR MCFEELY (VO)
Now this is the ink they use in the
printing press that prints the
magazines

FRED (VO)
Yellow ink It looks like mustard

A forklift moves a giant roll of paper
MR MCFEELY (VO)
And these are large rolls of blank
paper that will get loaded into the
machine
FRED (VO)
I wonder how many magazines they
can make out of one of those large
rolls
The PRINTING PRESS whirs to life

The belt spits out an image in blue then yellow then green
then red

MR MCFEELY (VO)
They print the magazines in giant
sheets One color at a time
The pages are sorted collated and stapled and then --
MR MCFEELY (VO)
This machine assembles the magazine
and glues it all together
The finished magazine flies out

The cover of ESQUIRE MAGAZINE

Now we’re in --

INT ESQUIRE MAGAZINE - DAY

Slick and bustling Magazine culture in its 90’s heyday

An EMPLOYEE weaves through cubicles distributing the new
issue to every desk

FRED (VO)
Oh now who’s this

MR MCFEELY (VO)

These are the people who decide
what will be in the magazine They
pick the pictures and design the
layout

FRED (VO)
Oh that’s an important job

MR MCFEELY (VO)
And these are the people who write
the words that go into a magazine

FRED (VO)
It is a lot of work to make a
magazine isn’t it

Lloyd enters the bullpen His lip is still swollen and his
black eye looks worse

He beelines for a corner office

INT ESQUIRE MAGAZINE - ELLEN’S OFFICE - DAY
Lloyd enters all smiles

From her desk Ellen sees Lloyd’s busted nose and raises her
eyebrows

LLOYD

puppets for a living
Ellen sighs done with him

ELLEN

INT ESQUIRE MAGAZINE - LLOYD’S CUBICLE - DAY

INT LLOYD’S BUILDING - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

into the eyes of each child
watching and speak to them as if
individually trying to be fully
present to their feelings and
needs

(MORE)

FRED (0C) (CONTD)
This is important when people of
any age speak to one another

The Loader snaps the slate

FIRST AD (CONTD)
And action

FRED

(to camera)

Do you know what this is It’s a
tent It’s something you can sleep
in when you are camping or just
when you’d like to sleep outdoors
Let’s set it up

Fred takes a couple poles and threads them through the nylon
with ease

As he threads the third pole the tent COLLAPSES
Lloyd smiles
Fred maintains his focus

FRED (CONTD)
Let’s see

He tries it again using his body weight to jam the pole into
the right place

The tent BUCKLES again Lloyd and Members of the Crew giggle
Margy and Bill look concerned

FRED (CONTD)
Mercy

Fred tries again
Same result
Fred’s sweaty and frustrated but smiling

FRED (CONTD)

I can’t -- I can’t do it It must
take two grown-ups to set up a
tent

The tent completely collapses

FIRST AD

That’s a CUT Let’s go again
FRED

Hold on please I’d like to watch

it
Fred moves to the monitors He watches while everyone waits

Margy comes over to Fred

MARGY
You know we can pre-set a tent for
you

FRED
No no this is fine I think we’re
good

Lloyds face says it all -- what the hell

FIRST AD
Okay that’s lunch everybody

INT FRED’S OFFICE - LATER - DAY

Small and cluttered with bamboo wallpaper No desk

The walls are filled with art and children’s drawings sent
from all over the world

Fred settles into his chair as Lloyd flips on his tape
recorder and takes out a notebook

LLOYD
The tent Why didn’t you let them
set it up for you

FRED
Children need to know that even
when adults plan things sometimes
they don’t turn out the way you’ve
hoped

LLOYD
Uh-huh

FRED
You’ve got to keep trying

Fred notices the ring on Lloyd’s finger

FRED (CONTD)
How long have you been married

LLOYD
Uh eight years

FRED
Oh that’s a wonderful
accomplishment Does your spouse
have a name

LLOYD
Andrea

FRED
Andrea I’d love to meet her one
day

LLOYD

I’m sure

(then )
Youve lived in Pittsburgh your
whole life

FRED
I grew up not too far from here in
a town called Latrobe but we’ve
lived here for quite some time and
weve raised our boys here

LLOYD
Do you think living here makes it
easier or more difficult to be a
celebrity

FRED
A celebrity Mercy

LLOYD
You don’t consider yourself famous

FRED
Fame is a four letter word and
like tape or zoom or face --

Lloyd blinks at Fred
FRED (CONTD)
What ultimately matters is what we
do with it

LLOYD
And what are you doing with it

FRED
Were trying to give children
positive ways to deal with their
feelings

Lloyd writes that down

LLOYD
This will be a piece for an issue
about heroes Do you consider
yourself a hero

FRED
I don’t think of myself as a hero
No not at all

LLOYD
What about “Mister Rogers” Is he a
hero

FRED

I don’t understand the question
LLOYD

There’s you Fred and there’s the

character you play Mister Rogers

Fred narrows his eyes studying Lloyd really taking him in

FRED

You said it was a play at the

plate That’s what happened to you

Lloyd forces a polite smile

FRED (CONTD)
What did happened to you Lloyd

Fred’s eyes are locked on Lloyd Lloyd hesitates then --

LLOYD
I got into a fight

FRED
Oh my Who did you get into a fight
with

LLOYD

It’s not important
Lloyd chuckles Fred doesn’t

LLOYD (CONTD)
Jerry
FRED
And who is Jerry

LLOYD
My father

FRED
Oh my

LLOYD

Id rather not talk about it

FRED
What were you and your father
fighting about

LLOYD
I’m here to interview you Mr
Rogers

FRED

Well that is what we’re doing
isn’t it

Lloyd and Fred stare at each other for an uncomfortable
moment

Margy knocks on the door frame

MARGY
Were ready for you in studio B
Fred

FRED

Okay Margy

LLOYD
I’m sorry I thought we had twenty
minutes
Fred gets up
FRED

May I take your picture Lloyd I

Fred takes out a camera and snaps his photo
FRED (CONTD)

It glides by Lady Aberlin who sprays a VINTAGE PERFUME
ATOMIZER around the castle and the leafy tree

She sniffs between sprays as she approaches Daniel’s Clock

DANIEL
Hello Lady Aberlin

LADY ABERLIN
Oh -- Hi Daniel

DANIEL
Are you making that funny smell

LADY ABERLIN
Uh you mean that skunk kinda
smell

Lloyd watches as --

Fred crouched under the scenery his hand reaching up into
the Daniel Striped Tiger Puppet

Fred strains to stay crouched He looks feeble
LADY ABERLIN (CONTD)
No I’m trying to help that smell

go away

DANIEL
By squirting another smell

LADY ABERLIN
That’s right A sweet smelling
smell Wanna smell

DANIEL
Okay

She sprays and Daniel takes a few sniffs

DANIEL (CONTD)
Hmm -- that does smell good

LADY ABERLIN
Where did the bad smell come from

DANIEL

That was Mister Skunk He got
scared and he just sprayed this
smell -- all over me

LADY ABERLIN
Oh no Did he say he was sorry

DANIEL
No and --

Fred’s voice cracks He teeters powering through his obvious
discomfort

DANIEL (CONTD)
-- that makes me so very MAD and I
don’t know what to do

Lady Aberlin takes Daniel’s little hand

LADY ABERLIN
Oh Daniel

The band starts in

LADY ABERLIN (SINGING) (CONTD)
What do you do with the mad that
you feel When you feel so mad you
could bite

Lloyd grits his teeth taking quick and shallow breaths

DANIEL (SINGING)
When the whole wide world seems oh
so wrong and nothing you do seems
very right
LADY ABERLIN (SINGING)
What do you do Do you punch a bag
Do you pound some clay or some
dough Do you round up friends for
a game of tag or see how fast you
go

Lloyd watches Fred sing as Daniel

DANIEL (SINGING)
I can stop when I want to Can stop
when I wish Can stop stop stop

ELL

more complex than I thought --

ELLEN

INT LLOYD’S LOFT - DAY

Lloyd sits on the floor close to the TV one hand on the VCR
A box of tapes is beside him

The volume is LOW

ON SCREEN THE ARSENIO HALL SHOW

ARSENIO HALL gives Fred late 60s one of his trademarked
leather jackets His house band plays the Neighborhood theme
song

Fred puts on the jacket -- and the audience chants WOOF-WOOF-
WOOF

ARSENIO HALL (ON SCREEN)
Now this gives new meaning to
“boys in the hoooood”

Fred laughs and claps along The audience is going nuts
Lloyd chuckles

ARSENIO HALL (ON SCREEN) (CONTD)
Well be back with Mister Rogers

Lloyd FAST FORWARDS until --

ARSENIO HALL (ON SCREEN) (CONTD)
Can we talk about kids just for a
minute kids today Um Ya know we
all grew up with you And uh I see
things going on out there kinda
worries me I wish uh more people
would watch Mister Rogers-

Andrea’s keys RATTLE and she comes in the front door -- Gavin
in a wrap on her chest groceries in both hands

ANDREA
Hey
LLOYD
Hey
Lloyd doesn’t budge
ANDREA

Howd it go

LLOYD
He’s just about the nicest person
I’ve ever met

ANDREA
When you say that it doesn’t sound
like a compliment

ARSENIO HALL (ON SCREEN)
There’s an attitude out there
there’s some things going on
there’s a lot of hopelessness What
do we need to do

FRED (ON SCREEN)

There are no simple answers of
course but if we could through
television programs as well as
every other imaginable program let
people know that each one of us is
precious

ARSENIO HALL (ON SCREEN)
It all starts in the home We can
never underrate how important that
is
MINIATURE LLOYD’S LOFT

The sun sets over Lloyd’s loft

INT LLOYD’S LOFT - LATE NIGHT

Lloyd stares at the TV Dark circles under his eyes

ON SCREEN LITTLE CONSUMERS

Old black and white footage A much younger Fred sits at his
piano giving an interview right to the camera

FRED (ON SCREEN)
I don’t think that anybody can grow
unless he really is accepted
exactly as he is Because if
somebody is always saying to a
child “uh you’re going to grow up
and you’re going to be fine” So
much of that in this country
anyway

Andrea brings Gavin to Lloyd
ANDREA
It’s your turn

LLOYD
Yup

She goes back to bed

FRED (ON SCREEN)
You know that a child is
appreciated for what he WILL be not
for what he is He WILL be a great
consumer someday And so the
quicker we can get them to grow up
and the quicker we can get them out
of the nest so that they will go
out and buy

Lloyd rocks Gavin

ON SCREEN SENATE CHAMBER 1969
Fred 40 sits behind a microphone at a hearing

NARRATOR (ON SCREEN) (VO)
In 1969 the US Senate considered a
bill that would cut funding for the
newly formed Corporation for Public
Broadcasting At stake was a grant
for nearly twenty million dollars

SENATOR PASTORE (ON SCREEN)
Will it make you happy if you read
it

FRED (ON SCREEN)
Id just like to talk about it if
its all right On our program we
deal with such things as -- as the
inner drama of childhood We dont
have to bop somebody over the head
to make drama on the screen We
deal with such things as getting a
haircut or the feelings about
brothers and sisters and the kind
of anger that arises in simple
family situations I think that
its much more dramatic that two
men could be working out their
feelings of anger -- much more
dramatic than showing something of
gunfire
SENATOR PASTORE (ON SCREEN)
Do you narrate it

FRED (ON SCREEN)
Im the host yes And I do all the
puppets and I write all the music
and I write all the scripts --

Lloyd bounces Gavin but he doesn’t look at him
absorbed in the TV

Gavin fusses

LLOYD
(to Gavin)
Shhh shh It’s okay little guy

FRED (ON SCREEN)
Could I tell you the words of one
of the songs which I feel is very
important

SENATOR PASTORE (ON SCREEN)
Yes

FRED (ON SCREEN)
It starts out “What do you do with
the mad that you feel” And that
first line came straight from a
child “When you feel so mad you
could bite When the whole wide
world seems oh so wrong and
nothing you do seems very right
What do you do Do you punch a bag
Do you pound some clay or some
dough Do you round up friends for
a game of tag or see how fast you
go Its great to be able to stop
when youve planned the thing
thats wrong And be able to do
something else instead -- and think
this song”

Fred is impassioned His voice clear and strong

FRED (ON SCREEN) (CONTD)
“TI can stop when I want to Can
stop when I wish Can stop stop
stop anytime And what a good
feeling to feel like this And know
that the feeling is really mine
Know that theres something deep
inside that helps us become what we
can

(MORE)
FRED (ON SCREEN) (CONTD)
For a girl can be someday a lady
and a boy can be someday a man”

All the attention turns to Senator Pastore

SENATOR PASTORE (ON SCREEN)
Well -- Im supposed to be a pretty
tough guy and this is the first
time Ive had goose bumps for the
last two days

The crowd laughs

FRED (ON SCREEN)
Well Im grateful not only for
your goose bumps but for your
interest in -- in our kind of
communication

SENATOR PASTORE (ON SCREEN)
I think its wonderful Its
wonderful Looks like you just
earned them their twenty million
dollars

The crowd applauds

Lloyd pauses the VCR capturing Fred smiling

ON SCREEN THE OPRAH WINFREY SHOW
OPRAH at her 1980s peak interviews Fred

OPRAH
What do you think is the biggest
mistake people make in raising
their children

FRED
Uh not to remember their own
childhood

OPRAH
Yeah

FRED
I think that the best thing that we
can do is to think about what it
was like for us and know what our
children are going through

CUT TO

OPRAH
But you know what it’s so hard
once you get to be a parent you
always say ‘I will never do this’
when your mother is doing it to
you or your father is doing it to
you you say I will never do this
to my child and then you get to
our age and you forget what it was
like to be this size You really do
forget

FRED
But those children can help re-
envoke what it was like And that’s
why when you’re a parent you have a
new chance to grow

OPRAH
You do Did you ever -- I can’t
imagine -- I know you are the

father of two boys but I can’t
imagine you ever having a problem
with your children You ever have
any

FRED
Well of course I’m a human being
just like everybody else
Lloyd stares down at Gavin who is now sound asleep --

rhythm -- and then suddenly the Woman is shaking Bill’s hand
as Fred moves on to the next person

LLOYD
Quite a skill

We stole Bill from the governor’s
office fourteen years ago Have you
got to know him yet

LLOYD
Love Bill Big fan

She puts out her hand

JOANNE (CONTD)

Oh nice to meet you
JOANNE
You as well dear

LLOYD
How does it feel to be married to
living saint

Joanne’s smile drops

JOANNE

I’m not fond of that term
LLOYD

Uh huh
JOANNE

If you think of him as a saint
then his way of being is
unattainable He works at it all

the time It’s a practice He’s not

a perfect person He has a temper
He chooses how he responds to that
anger

LLOYD
That must take a lot of effort

JOANNE

Well he does things every day that

help ground him He reads
scripture he swims laps He prays

for people by name Writes letters -
- hundreds of them He’s been doing

that since I met him
Fred walks up
FRED

Fred and Lloyd sit uncomfortably close together -- for Lloyd
Lloyd’s recorder is out and running

A suitcase rests at Fred’s feet
Fred smiles

LLOYD
Seems like all these people line up
to tell you their problems

FRED
Isn’t it wonderful Such bravery

LLOYD
Seems like that would be an
incredible burden on you

FRED
I’m grateful that you would say
that Lloyd I’m grateful for your
compassion

LLOYD
Is it a burden on you

Pause

LLOYD (CONTD)
Okay Let’s assume it is a burden
on you

FRED
There’s no normal life that’s free
from pain

LLOYD
How do you deal with it

FRED
Oh there are many things you can
do with your feelings that don’t
hurt yourself or anybody else

LLOYD
Yeah like what

FRED
Why you can pound a lump of clay
Or swim as fast as you can swim Or
play the lowest keys on the piano
all together
(then )
BOOM BOOM-BOOM

LLOYD
Do you ever talk to anyone about
the burden you carry

Fred pretends to slam the keys

FRED
BOOM

Lloyd blinks startled
The recorder runs with a faint electronic hiss
Fred looks up deliberate
FRED (CONTD)
Would you like to meet my friends
from The Neighborhood of Make
Believe
Fred opens the suitcase revealing several PUPPETS
LLOYD

They look like they’ve seen better
days

FRED
They’ve been with me quite a long
time

LLOYD

You ever think of swapping them out
or getting new ones

FRED
Didn’t you have any special friends
when you were very young Lloyd

LLOYD
Special friends

FRED
Maybe a special toy or a stuffed
animal you loved very much Even
when it got ratty and well-worn
you just loved it all the more

LLOYD
I don’t know I’m sure I did
FRED
Can you tell me about your special
friend
LLOYD
Uh -- I think I had a rabbit
FRED

Did your rabbit friend have a name

LLOYD
It was just rabbit --

A real memory rushes in dislodged from somewhere deep

LLOYD (CONTD)
It was Old Rabbit

Fred leans in

FRED
Who gave you Old Rabbit

Lloyd glares at Fred

LLOYD
My mom

FRED
She must love you very much
LLOYD
That she did She died when I was
young

FRED

I’m sure that if she saw you today
saw the person you have become
she’d be proud of you

LLOYD
I wanna get back to my questions

FRED
You wanted to meet my special
friends from the Neighborhood of
Make Believe

LLOYD
No I asked about the burden you
carry

FRED

Let’s see --

Fred scans his puppets one by one choosing his weapon
carefully First is the King Friday puppet

Fred does his voice deep and majestic

KING FRIDAY
I am King Friday the thirteenth
Lloyd Vogel the journalist I
presume

Lloyd stares blankly at the puppet
Fred picks up Daniel Striped Tiger

FRED

(in his own voice)
And here’s Daniel Striped Tiger
He’s often too shy to talk

(to Daniel)
But that’s all right Daniel

(to Lloyd)
Have you met Daniel

Fred moves closer to Lloyd sitting right next to him

LLOYD
No Not officially

Daniel turns to Lloyd

Fred speaks in Daniel’s high sweet voice

DANIEL
Id like to meet Old Rabbit
LLOYD
(to Fred)

I don’t want to talk about Old
Rabbit I gotta say

FRED
(to Daniel)
Maybe Lloyd doesn’t want to talk
right now Daniel And that’s okay

Daniel hangs his head

LLOYD
Can you put the puppet down

Fred obliges

FRED
What else would you like to
discuss Lloyd

LLOYD
You stopped making the show for
three years in the mid-seventies
Why did you quit

FRED
At the time I felt like the
program had covered the main facets
of childhood

LLOYD
And what brought you back Money
Boredom

FRED

My sons had grown into teenagers
And were struggling We all were I
realized there was still much more
to talk about

Lloyd leans in Finally something he can use
LLOYD

I can’t imagine it was easy to grow
up with you as a father

FRED

Until recently my eldest never
told people about me He’s very
private and that’s okay My
younger son -- he genuinely tested
me -- but eventually we found our
way I’m so proud of them both

(then )
But you’re right Lloyd -- it
couldn’t have been easy on them
Thank you Thank you for that
perspective

Lloyd sighs frustrated

LLOYD
You’re welcome

Fred waits patiently for the next question

Lloyd burns

FRED
Was that not the answer you were
looking for Being a parent doesn’t
mean being a perfect parent You
might be experiencing some of that
now with your son

Lloyd and Fred stare at each other for an uncomfortable

moment

FRED (CONTD)
And I’ve been thinking a great
deal about you and your father
Were you able to work through your
disagreement

LLOYD
This is ridiculous

Lloyd gets up

FRED
Where are you going Lloyd

LLOYD
We’re done Thanks It’s been a
real pleasure

Lloyd walks out

FRED
Mercy

LLOYD
(to Dorothy)
He left as soon as Mom got sick
Did you know that He couldn’t even
wait for her to die

JERRY
She really didn’t want me there

LLOYD
Because you were sleeping around
while she was dying

JERRY
I know It took me years to get
myself together Dorothy is why I’m
standing here She helped me grow
the hell up

Andrea’s eyes well Lloyd just stares then turns to Dorothy

LLOYD
You know what they tell you about
people dying They tell you it’s
peaceful They just slip away Mom
screamed as she went You know
that She screamed until she passed
out and then they came in and
revived her and she went right back

much of a conversation anymore
we knew we’d be here

Lloyd laughs

LLOYD

FRED

Lloyd is quiet
FRED (CONTD)
I’ve never met anyone like you in

my entire life

LLOYD
Broken people

FRED
I don’t think you are broken

A long beat

FRED (CONTD)

I know you are a man of conviction
a person who knows what is wrong
and what is right

(then )
Try to remember that your
relationship with your father also
helped to shape those parts He
helped you become who you are

Lloyd shifts uncomfortably
FRED (CONTD)
Would you do something with me
Lloyd A little exercise I like to
do sometimes

Lloyd glances around -- everyone’s staring and leaning in

Fred notices but rather than whisper he speaks a little
louder

FRED (CONTD)
Well take a minute and think about
all the people who loved us into
being

LLOYD
I can’t do that

FRED
They will come to you

Lloyd takes a deep breath

FRED (CONTD)
Just one minute of silence

Fred looks at his watch

FRED (CONTD)
Let’s begin

As the minute passes --
Lloyd sniffs
He sniffs again

We realize that the whole restaurant is quiet They’re all
doing it

And suddenly Fred is looking DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA and holds
his gaze effortlessly

Now Lloyds eyes are welling
His face contorts as the emotions build

For once finally Lloyd experiences a brief moment of
clarity

FRED (CONTD)
Thank you for doing that with me I
feel so much better

Lloyd smiles through his tears He knows what he has to do

So the way I left --

LLOYD
Yes I should’ve called you

ANDREA

You shouldn’t have left

(then )
The doctor came out looking for you
and I didn’t know what to tell her --
I didn’t know what to tell your dad
And of course I couldn’t get a cab
so I took a train At midnight The
way people were looking at me with
Gavin I was like ‘somebodys
calling child services’

Lloyd looks down
ANDREA (CONTD)
I know you’re trying to apologize
but that doesn’t mean it gets to be
easy

They both smile Andrea exhales

LLOYD
I realize now -- that I need to
deal with my -- feelings

On Andrea did he say feelings

LLOYD (CONTD)
When I’m scared -- which I was in
the hospital and have been for a
long time I guess -- I just get
really angry

ANDREA
Mmhmm

Lloyd fights for the words struggling

LLOYD
And -- I know it’s a way of saying
I can’t deal with this -- leave me

alone And that’s not what I want
Lloyd holds back tears

LLOYD (CONTD)
It’s the opposite of what I
actually want You and Gavin are --
I don’t want to push you away
Youre what I want

That’s a nice picture

TROLLEY (0C)
Toot toot

The Trolley passes by then stops and comes back

FRED
What’s that
TROLLEY
Toot Toot Toot
Fred chuckles -- Trolley is such a kidder
FRED

Oh I will thank you
The Trolley speeds away as the pianist noodles on the vibes
FRED (SINGING) (CONTD)
Its such a good feeling to know
youre alive Its such a happy
feeling

Fred takes off his blue boat shoes one at a time

FRED (SINGING) (CONTD)
Youre growing inside And when you
wake up ready to Say

He stands and unzips his Red Cardigan then moves to the
closet and opens the door

FRED (SINGING) (CONTD)
I think Ill make a snappy new
day

Fred snaps twice once with each hand

FRED (SINGING) (CONTD)
Its such a good feeling a very
good feeling the feeling you know
that Ill be back when the week is
new

He carefully hangs up the sweater then pulls his gray sport
coat off a hanger

FRED (SINGING) (CONTD)
And Ill have more ideas for you
And youll have things youll want
to talk about I will too
He grabs the board with windows on it from the bench

FRED (CONTD)
Be back next time

He waves and moves toward the front door

FRED (CONTD)
Bye bye

He goes smiling

FIRST AD
That’s a CUT

CREW
Cutting

We PULL BACK to reveal the set and the Crew who adjust
lights and reset the props

Fred walks over to the monitors and watches playback with
Margy

Fred nods approvingly -- then walks over to the PIANO

He sits down places his hands on the keys and begins to
play a light melody

MARGY
That’s a wrap We’re on location
tomorrow at Mister Wagner’s shoe
store Call time is eight AM ADs
have the call sheet

The band clears out

As the last of Crew exit the sound grows darker heavier
More emotional

The stage lights shut off leaving Fred -- alone -- in the
ghostly light

Fred finds the lowest keys and CRESCENDOS
Emotion pours out of him
BOOM BOOM BOOM

He strikes them one last time letting the sound fill the
space

BOOM
He sighs content

Then his fingers play across the keys morphing into
something brighter more hopeful --

The closing theme of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood
As Fred plays us off we --
POP TO BLACK

THE END
