EXT CEMETERY - DUSK

It is an ordinary dusk of normal quiet and shadow The
gray sky contains a soft glow from the recent sun so that
trees and long blades of grass seem to shimmer in the
gathering night There is a rasp of crickets and the
rustle of leaves in an occasional whispering breeze

Transitions are easy and gradual with relaxed studies of
earth grass and leafy branches on a high-mounded hill
Revelation of cemetery markers does nothing to disrupt the
peacefulness of our established mood when awareness comes
it is almost as though we have known where we were all
along We are in a typical rural cemetery conceivably
adjacent to a small church

Although the presence of a church is felt rather than
confirmed The stones range from small identifying slates
to monuments of careful designan occasional Franciscan
Crucifix or a carved image of a defending angel Over a
hundred years of death indicated in stones syllabic with
their year and the status of the families they represent

Over the other night sounds is added the gravel-rumble of a
slow-moving car A wider shot reveals the car and the
mounded cemetery as the car pulls into the gate and moves
down one of the cemetery roads the car passes in extreme
foreground and moves away from the camera In the breeze
of its passing the dead leaves that clutter the little
road swirl and move
Beyond the distant trees the last receding gray of dusk in
surrendering to the black The car continues When the car
stops we feel the absence of its soundsreplaced by the
crickets and the subtle wind Even as the car is still
rocking slightly form its stopping action we cut to a shot
through the driver window at the occupants of the car The
DRIVER is a young man in his mid-twenties and his
PASSENGER is a young woman his sister The man is in
shirtsleeves with a loosened tie His suit-coat is on the
clothing hook over the back seat The girl is wearing a
simple but attractive summer suit with the jacket removed
and folded on her lap She is fussing with her purse
while the man shuts off engine lights and leans back to
yawn and stretch his legs The girl closes a potato chip
bag brushes crumbs fluffs her hair typical feminine
gestures after a long ride The man stretches again

BARBARA
They ought to make the day the
time changes the first day of
summer Then two good things
would happen all at once

A little laugh from the man as he straightens his tie

BARBARA
I love the long days and the extra
sun

JOHN

A lot of good the extra daylight
does me i lost an hour’s sleep
And it’s dark already and we
still have a three-hour drive and
we won’t get back till after
midnight

Barbara reaches down to put her shoes on

BARBARA
If it really dragged you that
much you wouldn’t do it

JOHN
Are you kidding I certainly
don’t want to blow sunday on this
scene We’re gonna either have to
move mother to Parkville or move
the grave to pittsburgh
BARBARA
Oh you’re just being silly
Mother can’t make a drive like
this

John reaches to the back seat and produces a flowered
cross-shaped grave ornament In the center of the cross in
gold script on a red field is written “We Still Remember”

JOHN
Look twenty-five dollars “We
Still Remember” I don’t you
know it I don’t remember what

the guy looks like

BARBARA
Johnny it takes you five
minutes

JOHN
Three hours no six hours

six hours and five minutes

Barbara continues to primp and straighten her outfit John

hands her

the grave ornament and leans forward to struggle

into his suit jacket

She opens
keys from

JOHN

Mother wants to remember So we
have to drive four-hundred miles
to plant a cross on a grave as if
he’s staring up through the ground
to check out the decorations
(he points at the cross
inscription)

we have to remember and
she stays at home

BARBARA
Johnny we’re here all right

her door and turns to step out John takes the
the ignition and drops them into his pocket

JOHN
Hey hey Barb you know the
radio’s been on all this time

(Tighter Shot of Radio)
VOICE
Ladies and gentlemen please
forgive what hey you got
a signal Charlie

JOHN
It must have been the station

VOICE
do not be al

John clicks the radio off He gets out of the car and
walks around the front of it trotting to catch up with his
sister It is obvious that she didn’t hear him He
catches up to her and starts to repeat his discovery about
the radio

JOHN
Hey the radio is okay it’s
just

Barbara is more interested in finding the row containing
their father’s grave

BARBARA
You remember which row its in

JOHN
(Momentarily forgetting the
radio)
Huh Oh it’s over here I
think

They start in his suggested direction

JOHN
Did you hear the radio

BARBARA
(Looking ahead trying to
spot the grave)
Hmmm

JOHN
The radio’s fixed Must’ve been
the station not the radio

BARBARA
(Still searching intently
she tosses this Line away)
Good you won’t be as bitchy
driving home
Their jibes at each other are not really in anger but are
typical of brother-sister annoyance They walk through the
row of gravestones in the growing darkness

JOHN
(Making conversation with no
more Significance than a
comment about the weather)
Nobody around

BARBARA
Well it is late If you’d get up
a little earlier

JOHN
I already lost an hour’s sleep on
the time change

BARBARA
Oh sometimes I think you complain
just to hear yourself talk

JOHN
An hour earlier and it’d still be
light (He squints into the dusk)
It’s hard enough to find in the
light

BARBARA
There it is
(She points)

They move toward a grave with a standard rectangular

stone It is an unkept grave its outline cropped and
overgrown with grass and wilted flowers John takes the
flowered cross and stepping close to the headstone embeds
its wire-prong base into the earth as he rambles on

JOHN
Wonder what happened to the one
from last year Every year
twenty-five bucks for one of these
things and the one from last year
is gone

We hear Barbara’s voice The camera stays on John as he
builds up some dirt around the base of the ornament

BARBARA
The flowers die and the
caretaker or somebody takes them
away
JOHN
(Standing brushing himself
off)
Yeah a little spit and polish and
they can sell them again I
wonder how many times we’ve bought
the same

He doesn’t finish in standing he sees his sister with a
pair of rosary beads and he stops talking

She is praying silently looking down at the ground John
straightens his tie and buttons his jacket He steps
behind his sister puts his hands in his pockets and rocks
nervously on one foot She continues to pray John looks
around the cemetery

The stones are soft and white they seem very pale
There are a few moving shadows The sounds of the night
seem louder but this is only because they have stopped
talking The situation does not seem ominous John is
merely bored In the distance a huddled figure is walking
among the graves

JOHN
(Glancing at his watch)
C’mon Barb church was this
morning

The girl continues her prayers John lights a cigarette
idly exhales the first puff of smoke and looks around
again

The huddled figure still moves slowly among the graves
John turns to his sister and is about to say something but
sees her making the sign of the cross and dropping her
beads in her purse She turns from the grave and they both
start to walk slowly away

JOHN
(Slightly uncomfortable about
urging her to leave)
Well I mean prayin’s for
church

BARBARA
I haven’t seen you in church
lately
JOHN
Well grandpa told me I was damned
to hell (He says this lightly
looking ahead to a large tree He
smiles) You remember Right
here I jumped out at you from
behind that tree Grandpa got
all excited “You will be
damned ta hell”

Barbara smiles

JOHN
Right here I jumped out from
behind that tree at you

Barbara expresses annoyance

JOHN
You used to be so scared here

BARBARA
Johneee
(With forced irritation)

JOHN
(Laughing playfully)
Youre still afraid

BARBARA
Stop it I mean it
JOHN
(Mockingly)
They’re gonna get you
Barbara
BARBARA

Stop it You’re ignorant

JOHN
They’re coming for you
Barbara They’re gonna get
you (He leers at her as though

he is about to pounce)

BARBARA
(Becoming a little nervous)
Johnny stop
JOHN
(Mockingly ominous)
They’re coming out of their
graves after you they’re
coming to get you

With this John throws up his arms and his voice rises

The figure moving among the graves stops and stands for a
moment Barbara glances toward the figure and momentarily
her anxiety turns to embarrassment

BARBARA
(As we cut back to her)
Youre acting like an idiot

John speaks in a low tone now glancing at the figure as
they draw closer in their perpendicular paths John’s
remarks now are directed to Barbara as though he didn’t
want the old man to hear

JOHN
Here comes one of them now

BARBARA
(Walking faster)
He’1ll hear you

JOHN
Coming to get you

Barbara purses her lips in anger The couple is now only a
few yards from intersection their path with the old
figure

JOHN
(In a mocked-panic whisper)
I’m getting’ outa here

He bolts and runs up the path

BARBARA
John

Embarrassed she cuts herself short and continues to walk
more rapidly now Up the path beyond the intersection of
the man’s row John stops laughing and turns to look
back at his sister She is near the place where the paths
meet and so is the old man We cut close to her She is
looking down in embarrassed silence aware of her proximity
with the old man She feigns poise and as she makes the
intersection looks up nervously to deliver a socially
necessary smile to the old mourner
The old man lunges at the girl his hand grabs at her
hair A frightened gasp chokes her She is coughing The
man grips her arm and slashes at her clothing She flails
about choking trying to yell

JOHN
(Horrified)
Hey god

The man is all over Barbara unable to hold her in her
violent flailing His grabbing tears her jacket and
scratches her face He seems to be trying to bite her arm
John leaps at the man The three fall to the ground
Barbara kicking and beating with her purse John gets a
firm hold on the man and Barbara is able to wrench free
The man is thrashing wildly at all parts of John’s body
They struggle to their feet the figure thrashes beats

tears like an animal John clutches at him and they fall
in a heap In the darkness their form is as one thrashing
thing

Barbara screams wildly The two men make animal sounds
One figure gains the advantage and slams his fists down
against the other’s head Barbara is panic-stricken Her
screams turn to frenzied gasps as she finds a tree limb and
snatches it up But when she looks up she sees that one
has vanquished the other She stops in her tracks Night
sounds A close shot makes it clear that John is lying
limply on the ground with the other man hunched over his
form The man is doing something with the limp body still
ripping at it perhaps groping for money Barbara
cannot tell

BARBARA
Johnee

The old man freezes and looks up The girl raises her club
and rushes toward him He jumps into a half-standing
position like an animal hunched to spring Barbara stops
in her tracks The man is breathing heavily She starts
to back away The man holds very still She backs
further Faster total fear The man starts to move
slowly cat-like He steps over the body

Barbara drops the club and breaks into a dead run down the
path She screams The man moves after her but he is
considerably slower that she with seeming difficulty in
moving He appears almost crippled

In a flailing run Barbara reaches the car sobbing She
yanks open the door She can hear the man drawing nearer
She scrambles into the front seat and slams the door

shut No key The man draws nearer seeming to move
faster more desperate to reach the girl Barbara sobs

she clenches the steering wheel The driver’s window is
open she struggles to roll it up then pushes the lock
button The man is upon the car Barbara dives across the
seat to slam down the passenger-side lock button The man
rips at the door handles and pounds violently at the car
The girl starts screaming again The man Pounding
Clawing he grabs a stone from the road the
passenger window shatters into thousands of little cracks
Another pound sends the stone through the window and hands
grab through the opening to peel away the flakes of glass
in sections Barbara’s screams become more violent

She summons enough presence of mind to reach for the
emergency brake The man pounds and flails at the window
The car at the top of a long grade slowly starts to
drift The man struggles to hold it to rip out the
glass his arm breaks through his sleeve is ripped and
tattered the hand grabs at the inside of the door

the car moving faster the man struggles to cling he
is forced to trot after the car faster he losses
his footing grabs at the fender the bumper He falls
into the road the car gains momentum The man regains
his footing and starts after the car It is moving

faster Barbara is frozen in the driver’s seat clenching
the wheel The road ahead is black the speed is
frightening she pulls the light switch The
headlights dance beams of light among the trees The beams
reveal the grade in the road which is narrowing to one car
width and about two hundred feet ahead the downhill
grade ends and an uphill grade begins In desperation the
girl looks out the rear window Against the sky in the
light from the cemetery gate the man is still coming after
them In panic she looks about She is still in the
cemetery proper Rows of graves on both sides of the

road No lights from houses no signs of life The car
slows It’s momentum carries it some distance up the
upgrade Barbara glances backwards the man is moving
faster toward her she is terrified the car reaches a
full stop There is increased panic in her face as
she forgets herself and the car begins to drift

backward toward the man as he draws nearer The car
picks up momentum carrying her toward her pursuer
She grabs at the emergency brake and yanks it tight the
lurch of the car throwing her against the seat She
struggles with the door handle the button pops up the
man draws nearer she breaks from the car The man
keeps coming desperately trying to move faster

Barbara runs off the roadway and onto the turf of the
cemetery She falls kicks her shoes off gets up
and keeps running The man is still after her She reaches
a low stone wall which marks the end of the cemetery She
struggles over it and looks ahead for a moment to get her
bearings Across a main highway is a darkened gasoline

station and beyond it an old house She pants heavily
glancing up and down the highway but there is no sigh
of traffic The man is nearing the low cemetery wall She

breaks into a run across the highway

The gasoline station shows no signs of life It is old and
decrepit One light is out over the pumps The pump house
and surroundings are nearly lost in shadow Some fifty
yards away there is the old house She runs toward it

She presses against the side of the house in a darkened
corner trying to look up into the window Across the
highway she sees her pursuer struggle over the little
wall and in his clumsiness fall groveling on the ground
In panic she runs to the rear of the house and into the
shadows of a small back porch Her first impulse is to cry
out for help but she silences herself in favor of trying
to stay hidden She gasps trying to hold her breath
Silence night sounds and the sounds of the man’s
funning footsteps slowing to a trot then a walk the
footsteps stop

Barbara quickly glances about There is a rear window She
peers through it but inside everything is dark The
pursuing footsteps take up again She presses back against
the door of the house and her hand falls on the doorknob
She looks down at it grabs it with a turn and the door
opens She enters quickly as quietly as possible and
closes the door softly behind her bolting it and feeling
in the darkness for a key Her hand finds a skeleton key
and she turns it making a small rasp and click She leans
against the door listening and can still hear the distant
footfalls

Barbara finds that she is in the kitchen of the old house
She gropes through a door and into a large living room

no sign of life Her impulse is to cry for help but again
she stops herself for fear of being heard by the man
outside She darts back to the kitchen rummages through
drawers in a kitchen cabinet and finds the silverware
She chooses a large steak knife and grasping it tightly
goes to listen at the door again All is quiet She goes
back into the living room

Beyond it is an alcove that contains the front entrance to
the house She rushes to the front door and makes sure it
is locked Cautiously she pushes back a corner of the
curtain to see outside The view overlooks an expansive
lawn large shadowy pine trees and the service station
across the road

There is no sign of the attacker Suddenly there is noise
from outside the pounding and rattling of a door Barbara
drops the curtain edge and stiffens More sounds She
hurries to a side window Across the lawn the man is
pounding at the door to the garage She watches her eyes
wide with fear The man struggles with the door then
looks about and picks up something and smashes at it In
panic Barbara pulls away from the window

Across the room is a telephone She rushes to it and picks
up the receiver dial tone she frantically dials the
operator some Buzzes and clicks then

TELEPHONE OPERATOR RECORDING

(V0O)
I’m sorry our lines are
busy would you hold the line
please I’m sorry our lines
are
She quickly depresses the receiver buttons lets them up
and dials again long pause she can hear sounds from

the gas station

TELEPHONE OPERATOR (VO)
I’m sorry our lines
She depresses the buttons again dials 411 for
information another long pause then the rasp of a
busy signal The noises from the service station have
stopped She listens for a moment she shudders with
fear notices a telephone directory in a stand near the
phone Frantically her fingers search to pages for the
emergency numbers the police She dials shakily but
before she has dialed the last numbers the rapines of the
busy signal comes over the receiver She depresses the

buttons again footsteps she puts the phone down and
rushes to another window A figure is crossing the lawn
coming toward the house It is a different figure a

different man She runs to the door and peers out through
the curtains again The man still walks toward the house
A shadow darkens a strip of window at the left of the

door Its abruptness startles her She peels back a corner
of the curtain and sees the back of the first attacker not
ten feet away facing the man who is approaching The
attacker moves toward the new man Barbara freezes against
the door and glances down at her knife she looks back
out at the two men

They join each other under the dark hanging trees and
stand looking back toward the cemetery From inside the
house Barbara squints trying to see Finally the

attacker moves back across the road in the direction of
the cemetery The other man approaches the house seeks

the shadows of a tree and stops in an attitude of
stolid watching Barbara stares but can see little
She lunges toward the phone again dials the

operator the same recorded message She barely stops

herself from slamming down the receiver

Then suddenly a distant sound an approaching car She
scampers to the window and looks out The road seems
empty But after a moment a faint light appears bouncing
and rapidly approaching a car coming up the road
Barbara reaches for the doorknob edges the door open very
slightly The light spills dimly over the area There
under the great tree in the lawn is the silhouette of the
second man Barbara shudders she is afraid to make her
break for the approaching car

The figure appears to be sitting quite still it’s head

and shoulders slumped over it seems to be looking right
at the house The car speeds by Barbara just stares at
the figure She cannot run She closes the door and backs

into the shadows of the house

She turns to see all around her The large dreary rooms
are very quiet cast in shadow she spies a stairway
runs toward it still carrying the knife and starts up the
stairs The camera is level with her eye and picks up her
view of the stairs as she runs up panting and frantic
she climbs her hand grazing the banister still at her
eye level The camera starts to pick up the top of the
stairway the floor of the second landing A brief
glimpse of something on the floor there she continues
to climb the floor of the landing zoom in

toward camera the hand of A corpse

Barbara stops the corpse is almost skeletal with its
flesh ripped from it and it lies at the end of a trail of
blood Screaming in absolute horror Barbara almost falls
down the stairs She is gagging she breaks for the
door unlocks it and flings herself out into the night
completely unmindful of consequences she is bathed in
light two headlights are screeching toward camera

the sounds of a vehicle stopping Barbara covers her face
with her arms Someone rushes toward her

MAN
Are you one of ‘em

She stares frozen A man stands in front of her He is
large and crude in coveralls and tattered work shirt He
looks very strong and perhaps a little stupid Behind him
is and old battered pick-up truck which he has driven
right up onto the lawn of the house He holds a large
jack-handle in his hand and stands there panting Behind
him the man at the tree still stands

Barbara is still frozen

MAN
(The man shouts again)
Are you one of ‘em I seen ‘em to
look like you

The man at the tree moves forward Barbara screams and
steps back the truck driver spins to face the other
man The other man stops in his tracks The truck driver
backs protectively toward the girl while the other stands
just watching Finally the truck driver seizes Barbara’s
wrist and pulls her into the house slamming the door
behind them

Barbara falls back against a wall The truck driver locks
the door and throws the bolt He is breathing hard He
turns to look at the girl She brings the knife up ina
defensive gesture

TRUCKDRIVER
(Soothingly in a drawl
almost as he would address a
scared rabbit)

All right It’s awright
now
She stares widely at him He immediately concerns himself
with his surroundings He moves into the next room to
check the windows He tries a lamp it lights he turns it
off

Barbara weakly lowers the knife and falls to a sitting
position in a chair She watches the man intently he
calls to her from the other room

TRUCKDRIVER
Don’t you mind the creep
outside I can handle him
There’s probably gonna be lots
more of ‘em soon’s they fin’
out about us I’m outta
gas them pumps over there is
locked is there food
here Ill get us some
grub then we beat ‘em off an’

skedaddle
She just stares at him

TRUCKDRIVER
It ain’t no good no way Might’s
well have two tincans and a
string You live here

She remains silent looking toward the top of the stairs
The man follows her stare and starts toward the
stairs Halfway up he sees the corpse and stops

TRUCKDRIVER
Oh bejeses
(He stares for a moment then
slowly backs down the
stairs)

At the bottom of the stairs he just looks at the girl
shivering with shock in her chair Then he forces himself
back into action

TRUCKDRIVER

We gotta bust outta here git
to where there’s some folks
somebody with guns or
somethin

(He quickly moves toward the

kitchen )
Ill try to scare up some grub
He enters the kitchen and starts to rummage He flings open
the refrigerator and the cupboards Finding a stack of
large paper grocery bags he opens one and starts to fill
it with things from the refrigerator He hurls the stuff
into the bag He is interrupted by Barbara’s voice

BARBARA
(Weakly)
What’s happening

The man looks up at her

BARBARA
(Repeating)
What’s happening
(She shakes her head in
fright and bewilderment)

The truck driver looks at her She stands like a frightened
child in the kitchen doorway He is amazed at her
question A shattering crash startles them The man drops
the groceries and seizes his jack-handle He runs to the
front door and looks out through the curtained window
Another shattering sound The first attacker has joined
the second man at the old pick-up truck and with great
sticks the two are smashing out the headlights

TRUCKDRIVER
Two of ‘em

Once the lights are battered out the two men outside start
to beat at the body of the truck The truck driver spins
and lunges toward the girl

TRUCKDRIVER
How many how many
She backs further away the truck driver lunges again

this time in desperation to make her understand

TRUCKDRIVER
How many come on now ah
know you’re scared but ah can
handle them two bohoppers Now

how many more is out there

that truck’s our only chance to
git outta here How many
how many

He grabs her shoulders and she struggles against him
thrashing hysterical

BARBARA
I don’t know I don’t know
what’s happening I don’t

know what’s happening

She breaks into hysterical sobbing The truck driver spins
away from her and breaks for the door He looks out the
window for a moment The attackers still beat at the
truck wildly trying to tear it apart The truck driver
flings open the door and leaps off of the porch The two
men look up for the first time we see the faces of the
attackers they are dead things the flesh on their
faces is rotting and oozing their eyes bulge from deep
sockets their hair is long and their clothing rotten
and in tatters They are ghoulish beings staring up at
the truck driver he starts for them slowly with
building vengeance He moves steadily at first with
controlled power he speaks as he advances wielding
his jack-handle

TRUCKDRIVER
Come ‘n git it come on ‘n git
some o’ this jack-handle

He concentrates on his attack moving stolidly toward
the two creatures he breaks almost into a run But the
two rather than backing off move toward the man as
though drawn by some urge The man pounds into them
swinging and thrashing with arms and jack-handle They are
buffeted by his blows they seem weak compared to

him but his powerful blows don’t really stop them It

is like beating a rug He flings them back and they advance
again It is a violent brutal struggle But the big man
finally beats the two into the ground and for a great
while continues to pound a their limp forms He breaks
into almost sobbing with each of his blows He beats at
them and beats at them as the girl watches in shock from
the porch he thrashes and beats until she starts to
scream again Her screams pierce the night The man

stops Breathing heavily he stands enveloped in the
quiet of the night

The girl stands in the doorway the truck driver turns to
face her he is out of breath Suddenly a noise behind the
girl she spins and walking toward her from the
kitchen is another of the hideous creatures the truck
driver leaps toward the thing

TRUCKDRIVER
Lock that door
Barbara slams the door and locks it backing against it as
another equally brutal struggle ensues in the living room
The big man again beats the attacker down but another
appears at the kitchen door The truck driver leaps toward
it and with powerful jack-handle blows drives it out
beyond the door so that he can fall against it shutting
it He bolts it and stands leaning against the frame
trying to breathe

Long silence the truck driver just stares down at the
floor

TRUCKDRIVER
They know we’re in here now
there ain’t no use disputin’ that

Outside the house the fourth ghoul stands staring at the
back door Another slowly walks up behind it and
another At the front of the house three more stand near
the bodies of the first two

Pull off and follow focus from the front yard of the house
through the curtains at the front door to the face of the
girl as she spins to face the camera Her face twitches in
fright and her eyes are wide with a non-blinking stare

As she spins her eyes fall on the floor where the dead
humanoid lies The thing is askew on its back its right
arm extended toward the girl with fingers twisted as though
to grab

(Cut to MCU Camera is trucking in slowly)

There is a slight movement in the thing’s hand It

twitches the whole body twitches slightly The bent
broken neck has the being’s head twisted upward in an
open-mouthed glassy stare Barbara steps toward the

thing The fear in her face bears the beginnings of a sick
frown The hand twitches again The girl moves closer
drawn toward it staring down at it with overpowering
curiosity

The thing is something dead with the beginnings of decay
on its face and neck Barbara moves closer The thing
still twitches

She is staring right down into the thing’s eyes her
hands come up to her mouth the urge to be ill to
scream to run must all be foughtthe glassy stare from
bulging eyes right back up at her

(Camera shoots back and forth at her face and the staring
eyes of the dead thing zoom in on the thing it
seems as though the body is going to stand again it’s
face holds as much life as it did when it walked)

Suddenly with a rustling sound the thing moves (Cut
back) The big truck driver has a hold on the thing’s legs
and is dragging it across the floor

TRUCKDRIVER
Shut your eyes girl I’m
gittin’ this dead behopper outta

here

He is sweating His face shows anger and anguish as he
drags the body across the floor Barbara just stands her
hands still at her mouth watching The sounds of the
man’s breathing and his struggle fill the room With
the body he reaches the back door and lets the legs

fall

TRUCKDRIVER
You filthy

(He cuts himself short Cut-in for close-up)

The stark light on the big man’s face makes him shine in
his sweat His eyes are alert and afraid He turns
quickly to see through the small window-panes in the door

Outside lurking in shadow from the huge trees the three
beings watch and wait their arms dangling and eyes
bulging as they stare at the truck driver’s activities
With a swift move the big man unbolts the door flings it
open and bends toward the inert thing at his feet The
ghoulish things begin to move toward him With one great
heave the dead form is flopped outside the door It lies
across the threshold The things advance silently

TRUCKDRIVER
Filthy

Another great effort shoves the body almost clear From
inside the house the big man’s efforts cannot be clearly
seen by the girl because the doorframe is blocking her
view She moves into the kitchen The truck driver flops
the body down onto the edge of the porch The three
figures are close upon him are starting to reach out The
big man shudders He fumbles into the breast pocket of
this work shirt The things advance He produces a pack
of matches manages to strike one and touches the
burning tip to the clothing of the dead thing and with
almost a popping sound the clothing catches fire
The things in the yard stop in their tracks the fire
blazes slowly Shaking the truck driver touches the match
to other aspects of the thing’s clothing His fingers
burn and he snaps them throwing the match into the heaped
form He is breathing hard Standing he kicks the
burning thing off the edge of the porch watches it
roll down three small steps onto the grass where it lies
still the flames licking around it The three beings step
back slightly the big man clings to the banister around
the little porch his fists clench and his face is fiery
in the glow of the flames His voice quivers

TRUCKDRIVER
Ill git you ah’m gonna git you
All of you (His voice grows
stronger in his violence) All of
you

He stands defiantly on the little porch the flaming corpse
separating from the things that wait He spins

suddenly the girl stands inside the kitchen door His
face is a fury of sweat and quivering anger His eyes meet
the girl’s she steps slowly back into the room The

big man in great strides re-enters the kitchen and slams
the door bolting it again His breathing still loud is
even more rapid than before His eyes dart quickly about
the room in search of something

He rushes to the cabinets and throws them open begins
rummaging through them Standard kitchen utensils and
supplies He does not speak just frantically ransacks the
room

TRUCKDRIVER
See if you can find the light
switch

Barbara falls back against a wall and her hand gropes to a
switch The light from an overhead fixture comes on
providing dim illumination The big man continues to
clatter about frantically The light coming on makes the
girl blink She remains against the wall her hand still
touching the switch It is as though she dare not move
She watches silently

The man flings open drawers and spills contents onto the
shelving and onto the floor His hands fall to the
silverware drawer still open from when Barbara first
discovered it He pulls it out until it stoops itself with
a crash He roots through it pulls out a large knife and
sucking his breath in stuffs it under his belt Then he
reaches into the drawer again and produces another knife
Taking Barbara by surprise he strides toward her He
shoves the knife at her handle first but she falls back
slightly Her action stays his franticness breathing
heavily through his words he speaks to her

TRUCKDRIVER
- now you hang on to
this
She hesitates but she takes the knife She seems weak
almost apathetic as though she is losing control of

herself She stares at the weapon in her hand then her
eyes come up to meet the man’s intense face

TRUCKDRIVER
All right

He pulls away from her and continues to rummage but he
speaks periodically now between great breaths and between
the brief times when his interest is wrapped in something
he finds in his rummaging His search is not without
control it has a coordinated purpose it is selective
although frantic and desperate He looks for nails and
strips of wood or planks that he might nail around doors
and windows His actions are hurried and intent after
these defensive ends At first his search has his full
attention Gradually as he moves about and begins to come
up with several key items that he needs his efforts pace
down into a more deliberate flow he starts putting up
boards and tables against the vulnerable parts of the old
house

The mood relaxes in intensity becomes calmer more
analytical the barricading instills a feeling of
greater security And the knowledge of some security
begins to overtake the girl bringing her out of her shock
and passivity The scene proceeds as follows - the
girl looks at her knife recedes against the wall The
noise of the search is ever-present The man mutters
occasionally and spills his findings about the room At
first as new cabinets and drawers fail to turn up what he
is looking for he grows impatient and more violent

spools of thread buttons manicure implements shoe-shine
materials Another drawer immediately as the
drawer is flung open with a clatter the big man sees what
he needs he almost leaps into the drawer

TRUCKDRIVER
Tell me you ain’t the sweetest
thing

His big hand comes out of the drawer with an old pipe-
tobacco tin and in one gesture he spills its contents onto
a shelf nails and screws and washers and tacks spill
out onto the wooden shelf A few roll too far and clatter
onto the floor His fingers scoop them up He fumbles
through the little pile of things and selects the longest
nails In the batch and stuffs them into the breast
pocket of his work-shirt Even as he stuffs the nails into
his pocket he is already moving his eyes seeking for his
next need

TRUCKDRIVER
See if there’s any wood around the
fireplace out there

His hands explore the shelf surface The girl does not
respond immediately His impetus carries him toward
another shelf but in turning he notices the girl still
motionless

TRUCKDRIVER
Look You

(Angry at first he stops himself then speaks still
frantically but with less harshness)

TRUCKDRIVER (Contd )

You’re scared ah’m scared ah’m scared too
jist like you now (he composes himself even more)
we ain’t gonna be worth a plugged nickle if we don’t do
something’ ah’m gonna board up these doors and
windows but you gotta pitch in We gotta help
ourselves ‘cause there ain’t nobody around to help us
and we’re gonna be all right ok now I want you

to scamper out there and see if there’s any wood in that
fireplace

He stops still breathing hard The girl just looks at
him She starts to move very slowly away from the wall

TRUCKDRIVER
Ok

The girl is still for a long moment then nods her head
weakly

TRUCKDRIVER
Ok
The girl leaves the room and he continues his search She
moves quickly into the living-room area The darkness
stops her for and instant slowing her pace From the
kitchen come the clattering sounds of the man’s search
She looks ahead The white curtains on the windows seem to
glow and every shadow seems suspect Barbara shudders

(Shot of the foreboding room Closer shot on her face)

On a table is a bowl of large rounded flowers a breeze
causes them to stir in sync with a sound from the kitchen

The effect startles the girl she dives for a table lamp
clicks it on and dull illumination fills the room The
room is empty She starts slowly toward the fireplace
Near it is a stack of logwood and a few planks that might
be large enough to nail across the windows Still
clutching her knife she bends over the pile and gathers up
the planking She stands with her awkward load and the
foreboding room faces her again stopping her She bolts
and hurries toward the kitchen

Bursting through the door she finds the big man pounding
with his jack-handle at the hinges on a tall broom-closet
door One final swipe and a great yank frees the wooden
door and the man stands it against the wall next to the
broom-closet In the recesses of the closet the man spots
other useful items and pulls them out an ironing board
three center boards from a dining table and some old scrap
lumber

He motions for Barbara to follow as he grabs the closet
door and moves to the back door of the house which he had
previously bolted against the beings outside He slaps the
closet door up against the paned portion of the kitchen
door and finds that with this same piece he can cover the
kitchen window He leans against the piece of wood and
gropes in his pocket for nails The door starts to slip
slightly it does not completely cover the adjoining
window but it leaves slots of glass at the top and bottom
however it does cover the glass part of the entrance

door Barbara drops her burden and moves swiftly helping
the man by holding an end of the barrier in position The
truck-driver accepts her help automatically without
recognition and gives the barricade a cursory inspection
as he determines where to sink the nails Pulling several
nails from his pocket he places them and drives them in
with his jack-handle He drives two on his through the
door and molding until they grab then moves to her side
and drives two more When four are in he whacks at them
with the jack-handle until they are completely sunken then
begins to add more Now he starts to talk The first
decisive steps are taken Quite a lot of relief comes with
it Most of the house is still vulnerable but the
measures taken instill confidence While he talks though
he keeps working rapidly his pace as intense as ever

TRUCKDRIVER
There by god this ought to
hamp their crimper they ain’t
that strong there

Two more nails in position driven to the molding He
tests the barricading wood with two good yanks It holds

TRUCKDRIVER
They ain’t comin’ through that

He drives the last two nails in all the way

TRUCKDRIVER
Gotta figure out how much nails we
got

He sees the parts of the windows that remain uncovered

TRUCKDRIVER
I’11 leave that for now We’1l
fix the rest

He turns quickly from the barricade and looks around the
room No other doors or windows except the door that leads
to the living-room

TRUCKDRIVER
Well this place is fairly
secure
He examines planks and table extensions

TRUCKDRIVER
Now if we have to

The girl just stands and watches him

TRUCKDRIVER
If we have to we just run in
here and no draggin’ now or

fussin’ with your make-up or I
leave you out there We run in
here and board up this door

The door between the kitchen and living-room has been open
all the time The big man closes it tests it it shuts
tight He opens it again He quickly chooses several of
the lumber strips and stands them against the doorframe
He gropes in his pocket and notices that his supply of
nails is dwindling He checks the pile sprinkled from the
can He empties the can completely and fingers the
contents for all of the longest nails and tosses just
these back into the can He hands the can to the girl

TRUCKDRIVER
You take these

This time she reacts quickly and takes the little tobacco
tin from his big hand As she does so the man gathers as
much of the lumber as he can into his arms and starts out
of the room Barbara follows They are in the living-
room

TRUCKDRIVER
It ain’t gonna be too long they
be tryin’ to hammer their way in
here they’re afraid now

He drops his load of wood in the middle of the floor and
walks over to the largest front windows talking as he
moves His speech is rapid

TRUCKDRIVER
They’re scairt of fire too i
found that out

His eye measures the size of the big windows He looks all
around the room Finally his eyes fix on the large dining
table and he moves quickly toward it talking as he moves
resuming his train of thought

TRUCKDRIVER
There must’ve been fifty a
hundred of ‘em down in cambria
when the news broke

Barbara watches almost transfixed At his mention of the
number of the things her eyes reflect amazement and
frightened curiosity The man reaches the table walks
around it studying its size then hoists one end and turns
it onto its side Bracing it against himself he heaves on
one of the legs and tries to break it free With a great
ripping sound the table leg is torn off and the man drops
it onto the rug He continues talking punctuation his
remarks with vengeance on the table as he rips all the legs
off

TRUCKDRIVER
I seen this big gasoline truck
you know down beekman’s
beekman’s diner and I had
heard the radio I got a radio
in my truck

He wrenches at the second table leg it cracks loudly
but does not come free He moves to where his jack-handle
lies on the floor

TRUCKDRIVER
This cas’line truck come
screamin’ outta the diner lot onto

the road must be ten
fifteen of them things chasin’
it and it looks funny to me

but I don’t see the things runnin’
behind it right away

He picks up the jack-handle and hammers at the table leg
The second powerful swat frees the leg He moves on to the
third

TRUCKDRIVER

I just see this big truck and
it looks funny you know how slow
trucks’1l start and it’s
pullin’ out onto the road and
weavin’ then I see them
things and the truck’s movin’
so slow they’re catchin’ up

and grabbin’ jumpin’ on

Another table leg falls loose to the rug

TRUCKDRIVER
And that truck just cut right
‘cross the road through the
guard rail you know i’m
startin’ to throw on my brakes
and the truck smashes into this
big sign and into the pumps in the
esso station down there

hear this crash and that big
thing starts burnin’ and it’s
still movin’ right through
the pump stand and on into the
station and I’m stopped
stock still and I see them
things and they all startin’
to back off Some of em
runnin’ or at least it looks

like they’re runnin’ but they
move kinda like they’re

crippled but they keep backin
off and it’s like it’s
like they gotta get away from the
fires And the guy drivin’ the
truck can’t get out nohow he
got the cab of the truck plowed
halfway into the wall of the

station that thing’s fryin’
him in there and he’s

screamin’ screamin’ like
hell

Barbara’s eyes deepen and her face wrinkles in anxiety
The continuing nightmare grows more and more complex The
man swats the last leg from the table and the table-top
starts to drop He regains control of it and struggles
trying to move it into the next room Barbara
automatically moves to his assistance and they walk
together each burdened by the heavy table
TRUCKDRIVER
I don’t know what’s gonna happen
you know I mean I don’t
know what the whole place gonna
explode or fly to pieces
or what’s gonna happen I

start drivin’

for the gas

station and the cat in the
truck is screamin’ and

screamin’
he just stops

and after a while

The man sets down his end of the table and wipes beads of

sweat from his forehead
his previous exertion

His breathing is still heavy from

He wipes his hand on his shirt

His eyes are wide and angry it almost seems as though

he might weep

TRUCKDRIVER
And there’s them things
standin’ back ‘cross the
road standin’ lookin’
like lookin like like
they just come back from the grave
or somethin’ and they’re over
by the diner and there’s cars
and busses in the diner lot and
lots of windows is smashed and
it’s for sure them things done the
people in the diner in and
more is outside all over the
place just bidin’ their time for
a chance to move in so I start
my truck up and I barrel it right
at some of them things I’m
steamin’ down right on ‘em
(His face grows more intense
with the memory) and I get a
good look at ‘em I see
them for the first time in my
lights and then I
just run right down on
‘em I just grind down
down hard as I can andlI
knock a couple of ‘em about
fifty feet flailin’ into the
air and I just want to
smash them crush them
filthy things And they’re
just standin’ there They
ain’t runnin’ they ain’t
even tryin’ to get outta the
road some of em is even
reachin’ out as if they can
grab me But they’re just
standin’ there and the truck
is runnin’ them down
like they was bugs or
something’ they

Barbara is wide-eyed staring in disgust her hands still
clutched to the table-top She says nothing The man sees
her fear and stops himself

TRUCKDRIVER
I I’m

He refocuses his attention on the table-top and starts to
lift it again Barbara is practically motionless As he
tugs the table her hands fall away and she slowly pulls
them against herself He drags the table away from her
and she walks numbly behind having forgotten to assist
She just watches the man’s face

TRUCKDRIVER
I’m just I got kids
you know and I guess
they’11 do all right they can
take care of themselves but
they’re still only kids and
I’m bein’ away and all

and

Perspiring heavily he tugs the twists at the table-top
trying to fit it through the doorframe and into the living-
room

TRUCKDRIVER
I’m just gonna do what i can
and I’m gonna get back and
I’m gonna see my people and
things is gonna be all
right and I’m gonna get
back
He has started to almost babble he sees the girl

intently watching him and he stops He composes himself
with some effort and starts to speak a little more
slowly His voice is almost a monotone with enforced
calm but he does beneath his anger seem as confident as
could be expected of anyone under the circumstances

TRUCKDRIVER
Now you and me is gonna be all
right too we can head them
things off I mean you can
just just smash ‘em All you
got to do is just keep your head
and don’t be too afraid We move
faster than they can and they’re
awful weak and if you don’t
run and just keep swingin’
you can smash ‘em We’re smarter
‘n they are and we’re stronger
‘n they are We’re gonna stop
‘em okay

The girl stares

TRUCKDRIVER
All we got to do is just keep our
heads

They look at each other for a moment until the big man
turns and picks up the table again As he starts away with
it the girl speaks quietly and weakly
BARBARA
Who are they

The man stops in his tracks still supporting the heavy
table-top and looks with amazement at Barbara’s anxious
face Slowly it dawns on him that the girl has never
really been aware of the thing that has been happening
She had not heard the radio announcements the
bulletins she had been existing in a state of
uninformed shock

TRUCKDRIVER
(Incredulously)
You ain’t heard nothin

She stares blankly silently her eyes fastening in his
Her reply is her silence

TRUCKDRIVER
You mean you ain’t got no idea
about what’s goin’ on here

Barbara starts to nod her answer she begins to
tremble

BARBARA
I I

Her trembling increases she begins to shake violently and
suddenly she flings up her arms and flails them about
sobbing wildly she begins to walk in panic wildly and
aimlessly in circles about the room

BARBARA
no no no no
I I can’t what’s
happening what’s happening to
us why what’s
happening tell me
tell me

The man grabs her shakes her to bring her out of it and
her sobbing jerks to a halt but she remains staring
right through him her eyes seemingly focused beyond him
at some far distant point Her speech still nearly
hysterical becomes a little more coherent
BARBARA
We were in the cemetery
me and Johnnie my
brother Johnnie we brought
flowers for this
man came after me and
Johnnie he he
fought and now he
he’s

TRUCKDRIVER

All right all right
He tightens his grip She wrenches against him
BARBARA

Get your hands off me

She flings herself away from him beating him across the
chest taking him by surprise But in her momentum she
stumbles over an end table barely regains her balance and
stands facing the front door poised as if to run out

into the night

BARBARA
Weve go to help him got to
get Johnnie we’ve got to go
out and find him bring
him

She comes toward the man

pleading with tears the

desperate tears of a frightened child

BARBARA
Bring him here well be
safe we can help him

we

The man steps toward her

She backs away holding one hand

toward him defensively and the other toward her mouth

BARBARA

No no
got to we

please we’ve

He takes one deliberate stride for her

TRUCKDRIVER

Now now you
you’re safe here
take no chances

calm down
Now we can’t

BARBARA
We’ve go to get Johnnie
TRUCKDRIVER
Now come on now you
settle down you don’t know
what these things are It ain’t
like no sunday school out
there
BARBARA
Please pleeeese no
no no
She is sobbing violently her words become screams

She is verging toward complete hysteria The man struggles
to calm her she wrenches from him but his grip remains so
that her arms jerk her whole body in the act of wrenching
away She stares at the man their eyes meet in an instant
of calm but only an instant before she screams

she kicks him again and again as he struggles to pin her
arms at her sides and shove her against a wall At the
same time he does not want to hurt her With brute force
he shoves her backwards propelling her into a soft

chair but she is up again screaming and slapping at
his face He is forced to grab her again and practically
slam her into a corner He brings up one powerful fist and
punches the girl but her head recoils and the blow is
misplaced it does not put her out of commission But it
shocks her into dumb wounded silence He hits her again
squarely her eyes fall sorrowfully on his and she begins
to crumple she falls limp against him as he supports
her weight easing her into his arms Holding her he
looks dumbly about the room His eyes fall on the sofa

He does not carry but almost walks her to the sofa
permits her dead weight to fold onto it and eases her head
onto a cushion

Next to the couch is a cabinet-radio The man stabs at a
button clicking it on while the radio warms up he looks
around for the tin of nails finds it where Barbara had
dropped it takes nails and slides them into his pocket
The radio hisses and crackles with static He returns to
it and searches with the tuning dial At first just
static then it spins past what sounds like a voice
and he adjusts carefully trying to find the spot The
tuner finds a metallic monotone voice

The big man waves his hand in disgust at the repetition of
the radio and moves away as it continues it’s
announcement He resumes his efforts with the heavy wooden
tabletop This time he drags it to the living-room
window He leans it against the wall and pulls back the
curtain to peer outside There are now four figures
standing in the yard The voice of the distant radio
recording continues The figures stand very still their
arms dangling aspects of their silhouettes revealing
tattered clothing or shaggy hair They are cold dead
things Something in the distance suddenly startles the
truck-driver

From across the road a figure is moving toward the house
The man spins himself away from the door and rushes to the

fireplace He reaches for his matches In the little
stand near the couch where Barbara lies unconscious there
are old magazines The man grabs them rips pages loose

and crumples them into the fireplace He piles kindling
wood and larger logs then touches the paper with a lighted
match and a small fire takes hold

There is charcoal-light on the mantle He sprays the
glowing fire and it whooshes into a larger blaze almost
singeing the big man’s face as he works The larger logs
begin to burn He returns to the window The recorded
message repeats itself continuously The man hoists the
table-top to the window-sill and braces it there while he
places a nail in position He pounds with the jack-
handle driven by desperation another nail and
another With the table secure he checks it hastily and
leaps to another window where he can peer out between its
nailed-up boards

The new figure is just reaching the place where the others
stand silently The man rushes to the fire where the
biggest logs have now begun to blaze He seizes the
discarded table legs and saturates them with charcoal-
light then holds their largest ends into the fire until he
has two good flaming torches Then a torch in each hand
he moves toward the door again He nudges a big padded
armchair ahead of him to the door and taking both torches
in one hand pulls the curtain aside for another look at
the yard The figures still stand silently

With charcoal-light he drenches the padded armchair and
touches it with a torch It catches instantly and flames
lick and climb casting flickering light throughout the
house The heat on the man is severe but he has to fight
it He lunges for the door unbolting it and flinging it
wide open From the yard as the door bangs open the
flaming chair is visible It throws eerie irregular
illumination onto the lawn The waiting figures step back
slightly

The man shoves the chair through the doorway it slides
across the front porch It topples over the edge and the
flaming bulk tumbles down the steps onto the front lawn
In the rolling motion flames lick and fly and small
particles of the chair’s stuffing leap and glow in the
night wind The bonfire rages in the tall grass The
waiting figures back further away

Inside the house the front door bands shut and the man
fastens the bolt He hurries again to the window puts
more nails into the table-top fastening it securely then
surveys his surroundings seeking out possible
vulnerability

(The camera moves with him seeing the task that lies
ahead )
There is a side window in the living room a window in the
dining room at the other side of the house the front door
and the flanking glass panels He turns still inspecting
and his eyes reflect surprise The girl is sitting up on
the couch Her demeanor is startling

(As we cut to her)

Her face is bruised and she sits in silence staring at the
floor The radio drones on The fire plays on her face
and reflects in her eyes The man takes off his jacket and
moves toward her He fixes his jacket over her shoulders
and looks sympathetically into her face She just stares
at the floor The man feels dumb and helpless Forlornly
he moves to the pile of lumber chooses a table-board and
goes to the side window The radio voice continues

The truck-driver boards up the two side windows then moves
to the front door He gets an ironing board and places it
across the door horizontally It extends over the flanking
glass panels leaving cracks at the top and bottom but they
are to small for anything to get through He drives nails
through the board into the molding and tests the barricade
for strength Finding it sufficient he leaves it and goes
on to the next In the dining-room there are two closed
doors He tries one finds it locked examines it and
finds no latch It has been apparently locked with a
skeleton key The other door is locked and leads into a
den which contains several windows The man is
disappointed at the added vulnerability He thinks for a
moment then leaves the room shutting the door behind

him It is clear that he has decided to board up the door
rather than try to secure the bay windows

He checks his remaining lumber The supply is dwindling
but he selects the best piece for boarding the den door
He is about to start hammering when an idea strikes him
He opens the door again and enters the room There are
chairs a desk a bureau he steps to the desk and
starts to rummage through the drawers He pulls out paper
a stack of pencils and pens a compass a hundred little
odds and ends Another drawer A hundred more

things he leaves it open The bureau contains mostly
clothing he rips out the big drawers and hurls them
through the doorway and into the dining area One

drawer two their contents spilling onto the
floor he looks back at the bureau a final idea
hits him He shoves the great piece of furniture through
the door walking it through the tight opening until it
clears the doorway Then the desk which warrants another
struggle as the man attempts to secure all things of
possible value before he finally nails the door shut In
the closet there is a lot of old clothing the man finds a
good warm coat and jacket and flings them over his
shoulder High on the shelves are piles of old boxes
suitcases hatboxes and old umbrella He looks for an
instant debating their worth or the possible worth of
what they might contain At his feet he sees still more
clutter boxes umbrellas dust shoes and slippers He
picks up a pair of ladies’ flats and examines them
thinking of the barefoot girl out on the couch and tucks
them under his arm

As he pulls away something catches his eye within the
dark recess of the closet something shiny the sheen of a
finished piece of wood a familiar shape lying under a
pile of dirty clothing He reaches eagerly and his hand
finds what he had hoped a rifle He sets everything down
and rummages even more eagerly all over the floor of the
closet through shoe boxes under things items come flying
out of the closet A shoebox contains old letters and
postcards But in a cigar box clattering around with
pipe cleaners and cleaning fluid there is a maintenance
manual and a box of ammunition He flips open the box and
finds it half full He shoves manual and cartridges into
his pocket then decides to take the whole cigar box full
of material He tucks it under his arm gathers jackets
and shoes and leaves the room

In the dining room he drops the load of supplies on the
bureau and the sight of the girl in the living room stops
him short She is sitting as before not moving

TRUCKDRIVER
We’re all right now this
place is good and solid And I
found us a gun - a gun and some
bullets

He looks at Barbara from across the room She doesn’t seem
to take any note of his talking He turns to his work but
continues to speak

TRUCKDRIVER
So we got us a radio and
sooner or later somebody’11 come
and get us outta here we got
food in there (he starts to
board up the door to the den)
Oh and I got you some
shoes we’ll see in a minute
if they fit and some warm
clothes for you

He pounds at the nails The pounding and the repetition of
the radio message are the only sounds The last nail in
the check for sturdiness the big man turns toward the girl
again

RADIO ANNOUNCER (VO)
ernment to stay in your
homes Keep all doors and windows

Other than her upright position the girl shows no sign of
life Her wide eyes just stare through the floor at some
point beyond

RADIO ANNOUNCER (VO)
preferably boarded shut

TRUCKDRIVER
Well that’s us we’re doin’
all right

He can’t smile and with the girl not looking at him his
attempt is half-hearted He takes up the rifle the cigar-
box a coat and her shoes in one clumsy armful

(As he leaves the frame the camera lingers for an
instant The alcove in the dining area is cluttered with
things from the den the large pieces of furniture
obscuring the door that had been tried and found locked
The camera lingers long enough to make this door
significant)

The man kneels with his bundle in front of the girl then
drops the armful of materials at her feet He holds the
shoes that he found in the closet

TRUCKDRIVER
Now let’s see how big your
feet is

Looking up at her he is unable to cope with her

catatonia Her stillness makes him as gentle as he can be
but he converses with her still expecting her to reply and
react She does not

TRUCKDRIVER
Come on

He holds
lift her

one of the shoes near her foot
leg and slip into the shoe She
Finally the man takes one of her ankles and fumbles to put
the shoe on her foot It does not go on easily partly
because it is too small but mostly because of her
limpness but he gets it on sets her foot down and takes
up the other one He succeeds in getting the second shoe
on and leans back on his haunches looking up at her She
is staring at her feet

waiting for her to
is still

TRUCKDRIVER

Well that’s er that’s a

real cinderella story

No response The man reaches in
pocket but he has given Barbara

TRUCKDRIVER
Hey you know you

ain’t it

reflex for his jacket
his jacket

got my

cigarettes

He tries to smile again Still no reaction He reaches
toward her and his hand enters the pocket of the jacket he
has draped over her shoulders His action makes the girl
look directly at him and her stare makes him
uncomfortable

TRUCKDRIVER
You got my cigarettes

He tries a gentler tone as one would try to explain some
complex concept to a child He pulls the cigarettes from
the pocket and settles back from her again He fumbles for
a cigarette puts it in his mouth and lights it trying not
to look at the girl Her gaze is still fixed on his face

TRUCKDRIVER (CONTD)
(Inhaling the first puff of
smoke and blowing it through
his nose)
Ok now
to lie down you

maybe you ought

(MORE )
TRUCKDRIVER (CONTD)
(Fumbling with the cigarette
a thought occurs to him and
he tries it)
You smoke

He holds up the burning cigarette Her stare drops from
him back to the floor He takes another drag and blows the
smoke out quickly Another idea

TRUCKDRIVER

Maybe you oe
(He stops he is getting
nowhere he decides that his
time had better be spent in
securing the defenses of the
old house)

Okay

His okay is more definite than his other talk and he
scoops up the rifle and ammunition He examines the gun
dumps the shells onto the floor and methodically loads
them one at a time

TRUCKDRIVER
Now I don’t know if you’re
hearin’ me or not or if
youre out or somethin’ but
I’m goin’ upstairs now
okay now we’re safe down
here Ain’t nothin’ getting’ in
here at least not
easy I mean they might be

able to bust through that but
it’s gonna be some sweat and i
could hear ‘em and I think I

could keep ‘em out later on
I’m gonna fix things good so they
can’t get in no how but it’s

good for the time bein’
You’re okay here

He continues to load the rifle as he speaks his cigarette
dangling from his lip causing him to squint from the smoke
that curls around his eyes

TRUCKDRIVER
Now the upstairs is the only other
way somethin’ can get in here so
I’m gonna go up ‘n fix that

He snaps the clip after the last shell and is about to
stand when his glance falls on the girl again and he tries
to get through one last time

TRUCKDRIVER
Okay You gonna be all right

She remains silent The man stands tucks the rifle under
his arm grabs as much lumber as he can carry and starts
for the stairs the girl looks up at him and he is aware
of it but he keeps moving and her stare follows

TRUCKDRIVER
I’m gonna be right here You’re
all right now I’m right here
upstairs

He starts up the stairs At the top of the landing he is
confronted once again with the body that lies there torn
and defaced He sets down his supplies and the sight of
the corpse is repulsive and he tries not to look at it
The body is lying half across a blood-soaked throw-rug
a few feet away is another throw-rug with oriental
patterns and a fringe sewn around its edge The man grabs
the second rug and rips away one edge of the fringe Once
the initial tear is made the rest of the fringe peels away
easily He frees it and taking the rifle ties on end of
the fringe around the barrel and the other around the
narrow part of the stock This done he slings the rifle
over his shoulder Then he leans over the corpse and takes
hold of one end of the rug on which it lies and begins
dragging it across the floor

and

On the landing is a
doors He deposits
and throws open the
the other doors and
room He begins to

long corridor with several closed

the ugly load at one of the doorways
door Inside is a bedroom He tries
finds two more bedrooms one a child’s
remove furniture into the hallway his
plan is to afterwards board up the doors The noise of his
work fills the old house Downstairs Barbara still
sits dazed on the couch The fire flickers on her face
and the burning wood pops loudly now and again Objects in
the room are silhouetted and the atmosphere is stark

the man is able to read his

the air of a professional

forty-eight hours and is no
longer impressed with the
latest developments )

RADIO ANNOUNCER (VO)
Up to the minute reports inform us
that the siege first
documented in the midwestern
section of the country is indeed
spread across the nation and is
in fact world-wide Medical and
scientific advisors have been
summoned to the white house and
reporters on the scene in
Washington inform us that the

public the results of that
conference in an address to the
nation over your civil defense

(A long pause by the announcer the camera studies
Barbara’s face She is inert)

RADIO ANNOUNCER (VO)
The strange beings
that have appeared in most parts
of the nation seem to have
certain predictable patterns of

behavior in the few hours
following initial reports of
violence and death and

apparently deranged attacks on the
lives of people taken completely
off guard it has been established
that the alien beings are
human in many physical and
behavioral aspects Hypotheses as
to their origin and their aims
have to this point been so varied
and so diverse that we must only
report these factors to be
unknown teams of scientist and
physicians presently have the
corpses of several of the

RADIO ANNOUNCER (VO)
aggressors and these corpses are
being studied for clues that might
negate or confirm existing
theories the most
overwhelming fact is that
these beings are infiltrating
through urban and rural areas
throughout the nation in forces
of varying number and if they
have not as yet evidenced
themselves in your area
please take every available
precaution Attack may come at
any time in any place without
warning Repeating the important
facts from our previous reports

There is an aggressive

force army of
unexplained unidentified
humanoid beings that has
appeared In world-wide
proportions and these beings

are totally aggressive

irrational in their violence
civil defense efforts are

underway and investigations
as to the origin and purpose of
the aggressors are being
conducted All citizens are urged
to take utmost precautionary
measures to defend against

the insidious alien
force these beings are weak
in physical strength are

easily distinguishable from humans
by their deformed appearance

They are usually unarmed but
appear capable of handling
weapons They have appeared
not led and organized army not
with any apparent reason or

driven with the urges of
entranced or or
obsessed minds they appear
totally unthinking they can

I repeat they can be stopped by
immobilization that is by
blinding or dismembering they
are on the average weaker in
strength than an adult human but
their strength is in numbers in
surprise and in the sheer fact
that they are beyond our normal
realm of understanding They
appear to be irrational non-
communicative beings and they
are definitely to be considered
our enemies in what we must call a

At this Barbara bolts from the couch in wild screaming
hysteria She runs blindly toward the front door The
truck-driver appears at the top of the stairs Startled
un-slinging the gun he leaps down the stairs The girl is
clawing at the barricade trying to break out of the house
she is sobbing in wild desperation The man is almost upon
her but she writhes out his reach runs across the room
toward the maze of heaped-up furniture Suddenly from
within the maze strong hands grab her She screams in
terror The truck-driver rushes toward her and he is
startled by the sight of the other man who is trying to
contain the hysterical girl Behind him an older man
stands holding a length of pipe at his side They have
come through the door that the truck-driver had tried and
found locked The man holding Barbara is dressed in
coveralls he is probably a farmer he is big and powerful-
looking

TOM
(Still trying to calm the
girl)
It’s all right we’re from the
gas station we’re not

Barbara sags against him and sobs sporadically in shock
and semi-relief She is still nearly catatonic The older
man rushes to the radio The truck-driver just stares
dumbly as Tom calms the girl and leads her to a chair where
she sits very still numb with expended emotion The radio
voice continues with its information about the emergency
The older man Harry Tinsdale crouches close to the radio
still holding his length of pipe

HARRY
Listen

RADIO VOICE

periodic reports as
information reaches this newsroom
as well as survival information
and a listing of red cross rescue
points where pick-ups will be
made as often as possible with the
equipment and staff presently
available

The big truck-driver stands staring at the two new men He
exudes an air of resentment as though the strangers have
intruded on his private little fortress

TRUCKDRIVER
-Why Man I

TOM
Looks like you got things pretty
well locked in

TRUCKDRIVER
(Almost in an aggressive
tone)
Man I could’ve used some help
How long you guys been in there

HARRY
That’s the cellar It’s the
safest place

TRUCKDRIVER
Man you mean you didn’t hear the
racket we was makin’ up here

HARRY
How were we supposed to know what
was going on up here It could
have been those things for all we
know

TRUCKDRIVER
That girl was screamin’ Now you
know what a girl sounds like
Them things don’t make no noise
Anybody’s got to know there’s
somebody up here could use some
help

TOM
You can’t really tell what’s goin’
on from down there

HARRY
We thought we could hear screams
but that might have meant
Those things were in the house
after her

TRUCKDRIVER
And you wouldn’t come up ‘n help
TOM
(A little ashamed)
Well I if there was

more of us

HARRY
That racket sounded like the place
was being ripped apart How

were we supposed
TRUCKDRIVER
You just said it was hard to hear
down there Now you say it
sounded like the place was being
ripped apart You better get your
story straight mister

HARRY
All right Now you tell me I’m
not going to take those kind of
chances when we got a safe
place We luck into a safe
place and you’re tellin’ us to
risk our lives just because
somebody needs help

TRUCKDRIVER
Somethin’ like that yeah

TOM
(Not knowing whose side to
take)
All right why don’t we
settle

HARRY

(Ignoring everything but his

own line of thought)
Look mister (he shouts this
then calms his voice for the rest
of the line) all right we
came up okay We’re here Now I
suggest we all go back downstairs
before any of these things find
out we’re in here

TRUCKDRIVER
They can’t get in here

TOM
You got the whole place boarded
up

TRUCKDRIVER
(His attitude softer toward
Tom)
Most of it all but upstairs
It’s weak in places but it won’t
be hard to fix it up good

HARRY
You’re insane The cellars the
safest place in the house

TRUCKDRIVER
(Lashes out)
I’m tellin’ you they can’t get in
here

HARRY
And I’m tellin you those
things turned over our car We
were damned lucky to get away at
all Now you tell me they can’t
get
through a pile of wood

TOM
His wife and kid’s downstairs
The kid’s pretty badly tore up

This statement takes the truck-driver completely by

surprise His face softens he exhales a deep breath

Nobody says anything for a long moment Finally the
truck-driver swallows and makes his point again

TRUCKDRIVER
Well I I think we’re better
off up here

TOM
(Glancing about at the
barricades )
We could strengthen all these up
Mr Tinsdale

TRUCKDRIVER
Man with all us workin’ we could
fix this up so nothin’ can get in

here and we got food the
fire and we got the radio
HARRY

We can bring all those things
downstairs with us Man you’re
crazy you got a million windows up
here All these windows
you’re gonna make strong enough to
keep them out

TRUCKDRIVER
Them things ain’t got no strength
man I smashed three of ‘em pushed
another one out the door

HARRY
I’m telling you they turned our
car onto it’s roof

TRUCKDRIVER
Oh hell any good five men can do
that

HARRY
That’s my point only
there’s not going to be five
there’s not going to be ten
twenty thirty a hundred
Maybe you know Once they
know we’re in here the place’11l
be crawlin’ with ‘em

TRUCKDRIVER
Well if there’s that many there
gonna get us wherever we’re at

HARRY
Look in the cellar there’s only
one door all right Only one
that’s the only place we have to
protect And Tom and I fixed it
so it locks and boards from the
inside but all these doors and
windows Why we’d never
know where they were going to hit
us next

TRUCKDRIVER
You got a point Mr Tinsdale but
down in the cellar there’s no
place to run I mean if they
do get in there’s no back exit
We’d be done for

This stops Harry for an instant

TOM
We could get out of here if we had
to and we can see what’s
goin’ on outside Down there
there ain’t any windows If a
rescue party does come we’d never
know it windows

HARRY

But the cellar is the strongest
place

TRUCKDRIVER
The upstairs is just as much of a
trap as the cellar There’s

three rooms up there and they
have to be boarded up like this
stuff down here Then if they
do get in the windows they can’t
get past the doors and
they’re weak we can keep them
out I got this gun now and I
didn’t have it before and I still
beat three of them off now
we might have to try and get out
of here ourselves ‘cause there
ain’t no guarantee that anybody is
gonna send help Suppose them
things come in here We can’t
bust outta the cellar cause we
open that one door and they got

us

TOM
I don’t know I think he’s right
(he turns to the truck-driver) You
know how many’s out there

TRUCKDRIVER
I figure maybe six seven

HARRY
Look you two can do whatever you
like I’m going back down to the
cellar and you better decide
because I’m gonna board up that
door and I’m not gonna be crazy
enough to unlock it again no
matter what happens

TOM
Wait a minute Mr Tinsdale let’s
think about this for awhile

HARRY
Nope I’ve made my decision You
make yours And you can stew in
your own juice

TOM
(Flashing anger)
Now wait a minute dammit let’s

think about this awhile We
can make it into the cellar if we
have to and if we do decide
to stay down there we will need
some things from up here Now
let’s at least consider this
awhile

TRUCKDRIVER

Man if you box yourself into that
cellar and if there is a lot of
them things that get into the
house you had it At least up
here you can outrun the things

Tom is gone to one of the windows and is peering out
through an opening in the barricade

TOM
Yeah looks like six or
about eight

His hand goes to his temple and he rubs nervously his
demeanor a little shaken The truck-driver joins him at
the window

TRUCKDRIVER
That’s more than there was
there’s a bunch out the back
too (he pivots to check the
kitchen) unless they’re the
same ones that was back here

He bursts into the kitchen as the fringed rifle sling
snaps and the weapon starts to fall He twists to keep it
on his back and tries to grab it reaching behind His
attention on the gun he does not see the door as he moves
toward it He regains control of the gun and looks up and
stops cold Hands are reaching through the broken glass

behind the barricades graying rotting hands
scratching reaching trying to grab and through
aspects of the glass the inhuman faces behind the
hands The barrier is being strained no doubt about that

but it is holding well enough

The man smashes with the rifle butt against the ugly
extremities pounding once twice One of the
grabbing hands is driven back with a shattering of the
already broken glass it was reaching through The rifle
butt smashes one of the hands against the door molding
solidly but the hand unfeeling of pain continues to
claw after a hold The man slides his finger to the
trigger and turns the rifle smashing the barrel through
another of the little broken glass areas and two of the
gray hands seize the protruding metal A dead face appears
behind the hands ugly expressionless The man’s
face looks directly through the opening into the dead eyes
beyond the man struggling desperately to control the
weapon and the zombie thing outside trying to pull it away
by the barrel A brief instant when the muzzle points
directly at the hideous face BLAM the report
shatters the air the lifeless thing is thrown back
propelled by the blast its head torn partially away its
still outstretched hands falling back with the crumpling
body The other hands continue to clutch and grab Tom has
rushed into the kitchen and Harry is standing cautiously a
few feet from the doorway still in the dining area A
distant voice that of Harry’s wife suddenly begins to cry
out from the cellar

HELEN

Harry Harry

Harry Are you all right
HARRY

it’s all right Helen we’re

all right

Tom immediately rushes to the door The truck-driver is
pounding at a hand that is trying to work at the barricade
from the bottom The blows seem ineffectual as the hand
oblivious except for the physical jouncing about from
impact continues to grab Tom leaps against the door and
grabs the rotting wrist with both his hands and tries to
bend the wrist back in an effort to break it but it seems
limp and almost pliable Disgust sweeps over the young
man’s face He tries to scrape the cold thing against the
edge of the broken glass and the absence of blood is
immediately evident as the sharp edge rips into what looks
like rotting flesh

Another hand grabs at Tom’s wrist and tries to pull it
through the glass Tom yells and the truck-driver tries
to swing the barrel of the gun toward the thing struggling
with Tom but another hand clutches at him even as he is
trying to help the younger man A hand is clawing and
ripping his shirt but he focuses his attention on
aiming the gun Another loud blast and the hands Tom was
fighting jerk back and fall into darkness Foot against
the wall the big man forces himself away from the door out
of the grasp of the hand still clutching his shirt The
shirt tears away and the thing backs off still with the
fragment in its hand Badly shaken Tom just stares
through another opening in the door The truck-driver
takes careful aim and pulls the trigger again the blast
rips through the thing’s chest leaving s gaping hole in

its back but it remains on its feet backing slowly
away
TOM
Oh Good God

Panicked at the failure of the weapon the big man levels
off again another loud report This time the shell
rips through the things thigh just below the pelvis The
thing still backs away but as it tries to put weight on
its right leg it falls to a heap The two men just stare
in disbelief The thing is still moving away dragging
itself with its arms and pushing against the ground with
its remaining leg

TOM
Mother Of God What are these
things

The truck-driver wets his lips takes a deep breath and
holds it carefully sights down the barrel of the rifle
again He pulls the trigger The shell seems to blow open
the skull of the crawling form and it falls backwards

TRUCKDRIVER
Damn damn thing from
hell
(His voice trembles as he
lets out his held breath)

Outside the thing that has fallen limply without the use
of its eyes moves its arms in groping clutching motions
seemingly still trying to drag itself away

HELEN
(From the cellar)
Harry Harry
After a moment of silence the truck-driver turns from the
door

TRUCKDRIVER
We gotta fix these boards

He starts to move to gather supplies when Harry speaks

HARRY
Youre crazy those things are
gonna be at every door and window
in the place We’ve got to get
into the cellar

The big truck-driver turns to Harry with absolute fury in
his eyes His voice is deeper in his rage and more
commanding

TRUCKDRIVER
Go ahead into your damn cellar
Get outta here

The shouting stops Harry for an instant then his adamancy
returns He has decided that he will go into the cellar
without the others if need be and is now prepared to gather
his supplies

HARRY
I’m taking the girl with me

He moves toward the refrigerator in the kitchen but the
big man steps in front of him

TRUCKDRIVER
You keep your hands off of her
she’s stayin’ here with me

Harry is stopped again for a moment Then he moves toward
the refrigerator again

TRUCKDRIVER (CONTD)
And you don’t touch none of that
food

(MORE )

TRUCKDRIVER (CONTD)
(His grip is still on the
gun and though he doesn’t
point it at Harry we are
aware of the power it
implies)
Now if I stay up here I’m gonna be
fightin’ for what’s up here
And that food and that radio and
all this is what I’m fightin’
for And you are stone dead

wrong you’re just wrong you
understand Now if you’re
makin’ it to the cellar get your
ass movin’ go down these
stairs and get out of here
man and and don’t

mess with me no more

HARRY
(Turning toward Tom)
The man is crazy he’s
crazy We’ve got to have food
down there we havea
right

TRUCKDRIVER
This is your house
(He knows it isn’t)

HARRY
We’ve go a right to

TRUCKDRIVER
(Confronting Tom)
You goin’ down there with him

TOM
Well

TRUCKDRIVER
No beatin’ around the bush
you goin’ or ain’t you This is
your last chance

There is a long moment of silence Tom then turns to the
older man

TOM
Harry I think he’s right

HARRY
You’re crazy
TOM
I really think we’re better off up
here

HARRY

Youre crazy I got a kid down
there He can’t take all the
racket and those things reaching
through the glass We’1ll be lucky
if he lives as it is now

TRUCKDRIVER

(More impersonal than ever

before)
Okay Now you’re his father If
youre dumb enough to go die in
that trap it’s your business
But I ain’t dumb enough to go with
you it’s just bad luck for the
kid that his old man’s so

dumb Now get the hell down
the cellar you can be boss
down there and I’m boss up
here and you ain’t takin’

none of this food and you ain’t
takin’ nothin’

TOM
Harry we can get food to
you if you want to stay down
there and

HARRY

You bastards

HELEN
(From the cellar)
Harry Harry

Harry looks toward the cellar door looks back at the two

men

then quickly moves toward the door

HARRY
You know I won’t open the door
again I mean it

TOM
We can fix this up here With
your help we could

HARRY
Yeah well I think you’re
both nuts with my help

TRUCKDRIVER
(To Tom)
Let him go man his mind is made
up now let him go

Harry looks for a moment then lunges for the cellar door
opens it and slams it behind him sounds of his
footsteps going down the steps

TOM
(Rushes to the door)
Harry wed be better off up here

The truck-driver ties the broken fringe back onto the
rifle then begins to reload the gun replacing the spent
shells

TOM
(Shouting through the door)
Harry if we stick together man
we can fix it up real good
There are places we can run to up
here

We hear sounds of Harry boarding up the door The truck-
driver straps the gun to his shoulder again then turns and
moves toward the upstairs In passing his glance falls on
Barbara He steps backward off the stairs and looks at
her The radio has taken up again with the monotonous
recorded message

TOM
Harry we’d be better off if
all three of us was workin’
together
(Sounds of Harry’s
barricading)

TOM

Well let you have food when you
need it

(he glances warily at the

truck-driver half-expecting

reprisal for this)

and if we knock those things

might be chasin’ us and you can
let us in

Barricading sounds stop Footsteps can be heard as Harry
walks down the cellar steps Tom listens awhile then
retreats disappointed and worried about the lack of
Harry’s efforts in the defensive measures that must lie
ahead
The truck-driver is with Barbara stooping beside her
chair she stares into an unseeing void The big man
softens at seeing her

TRUCKDRIVER
Hey hey honey
He brushes her hair back from her eyes Tears well up and

it almost seems as though she might acknowledge his
tenderness but she does not The man feels very
sorrowful almost as he would feel for his child when it
was sick He massages his forehead and eyes tired from
fear and exertion of the past hours He bends to cover
the girl with a coat that he had brought from the den then
steps away and feeds the fire and stirs it to keep the
blaze good and warm the primary concern in this effort is
for the girl Behind him tom walks up truck-driver
senses his presence

TRUCKDRIVER
He’s wrong man

Tom is silent

TRUCKDRIVER
I ain’t boxin’ myself in down
there no how
(he finishes with the fire
and rises to go upstairs to
continue his work there)
We might be here several days

well get it fixed up he’l1l
come up He ain’t gonna stay
down there very long -- he’l1ll
wanta see what’s goin’ on or
maybe if we get a chance to “get
out he’1ll come up

He turns and goes up the

stairs

The cellar with its stark gray
walls and dusty clutter seems
cold and damp Cardboard cartons
tied with cord and a hanging grid
of pipe-work all look dirty in the
subdued light of bare light
bulbs The cartons take up must
of the space they vary in size
from grocery boxes with faded
brand names to large packing
crates that might have contained
furniture The washing machine
an old roller type sits off ina
corner of the cellar near a
makeshift shower stall

(MORE )

TRUCKDRIVER
Lines for drying clothes are
strung over the pipe-work so low
that Harry has to duck under them
as he walks from the stairs to the
other side of the confining
quarters There are stationary
tubs and an old metallic cabinet
against one of the walls Harry’s
wife Helen is at the faucet over
the tubs wetting a cloth with
cold water She looks up as Harry
enters but is more interested in
what she is doing at the moment
She wrings out the cloth and takes
it to where a young boy their
son lies motionlessly atop a
homemade worktable On a peg-
board above the table are hanging
tools and cables and built into
the table itself are drawers that
probably contain smaller tools
screws and bolts washers etc
The woman moves a little stiffly
in the coolness of the cellar
She is wearing a dress and
sweater while a warmer coat is
spread on the table under the boy
its sides flopped up and over him
covering his legs and chest The
woman bends over her son and wipes
his head with the cool cloth

Harry quietly walks up behind her She concentrates on
caring for the boy and pulls the coat more securely around
him

HELEN
(Not looking up)
He has a bad fever

HARRY
There’s two more people upstairs

HELEN
(Still primarily concerned
with the boy’s comfort)
Two
HARRY
Yeah
(a long pause then half-
defensively)
I wasn’t about to take any
unnecessary chances

Helen is silent

HARRY
How did we know what was going on
up there

Harry nervously reaches to his breast pocket for a
cigarette He produces an empty pack and seeing that it
is empty crumples it in his hand and pitches it to the
floor He steps over to the worktable where there is
another pack snatches it up and it too is empty With
the same crumpling action he discards this pack violently
this time the action spinning him into a position facing
his wife and boy She continues to quietly swab the boy’s
forehead Harry stares at them for a moment

HARRY
Does he seem to be all right

Helen is silent The boy is motionless He is sweating to
the point where beads of sweat are formed all over his
face Harry waits and seeing no answer forthcoming
changes the subject

HARRY
They’re all staying upstairs
Idiots We should stick
together it’s safest down
here

He goes to his wife’s purse and rummages through it’s
contents He pulls out a pack of cigarettes rips the pack
open and fumbles for a cigarette He lights it and drags
in the first puff deeply It makes him cough slightly

HARRY
They don’t stand a chance up
there they can’t hold those
things off forever There’s
too many ways they can get into
the house up there

Helen remains silent On the floor next to the workbench
is a small transistor radio Harry’s glance falls on it
and he stabs at it scoops it up and clicks it on

HARRY
They had a radio on upstairs
must’ve been civil defense or
I think it’s not just us this
thing is happening all over

The radio picks up nothing but static Harry plays with the
tuning dial listening anxiously but across the receiving
band the transistor Just hisses Harry holds the radio up
and turns it into various positions trying it for
reception spinning the tuner as he goes Still nothing
but hiss He walks around the room with still no results

HARRY
This damned thing

Still just static

Helen stops wiping the boy’s forehead and neatly folds the
cloth and drapes it over her son’s brow She gently
places her hand on the boy’s chest and looks over toward
her husband He moves impatiently around the cellar his
cigarette dangling from his lip waving the little radio
around in the air The radio just emits static at varying
levels

HELEN
Harry

He continues his fidgeting with the radio He goes near
the walls and stairs holding it high and still spinning
the dial

HELEN
Harry that thing can’t pick
up anything in this stinking

dungeon

Her rising tone of voice stops him he turns and looks at
her About to cry she brings her hands to her face She
bites her lip and just stares at the floor Looking at
her Harry lets his anger take hold of him but he cannot
think of words His face twitches his emotion searching
for some vehicle or expression until he pivots violently
and flings the radio across the room

HARRY

(Shouting)
I hate you right I hate the
kid I wanna see you die here
right In this stinking place my
god Helen do you realize what’s
happening Those things are all
over the place they’ll kill
us all I enjoy watching my kid
suffer like this I enjoy seeing
all this happen

Helen’s head jerks toward him She looks at him with what
is almost vengeance

HELEN
He needs help he needs a
doctor he’s he’s
gonna maybe die here We have
to get out of here Harry we
have to

HARRY
Oh yeah let’s just walk

out We can pack up right now and
get ready to go and i’ll just say
to those things Excuse me my
wife and kid are uncomfortable
here we’re going into town’
For god’s sake there’s maybe
twenty of those things out there
and there’s more every

minute

HELEN
There’s people upstairs We
should stick together you said
Are we fighting with them
Upstairs downstairs what’s
the difference
Maybe they can help us lLet’s get

out of here let’s go
upstairs let’s do

something let’s get out of
here

A pounding sound interrupts her They listen The sound
is coming from the door at the top of the stairs

TOM
HARRY
(From outside the door)
More pounding Harry just stares up at the door and does
not answer the call Tears well in Helen’s eyes More
pounding Helen looks at Harry When he does not respond
she gets up and goes for the stairs

HELEN
Yes yes Tom

Harry running after her grabs her shoulders from behind
and stops her

HELEN
Harry Harry it’s Tom
Ryan
TOM
(Through the door)
Harry we got food and some
medicine and things from up
here

Harry stares up at the door speechlessly

TOM
There’s gonna be a thing on the
radio in ten minutes
Harry a civil defense
thing to tell us what to do

HELEN
(Looking up at the door
shouts)
WERE COMING UP WE’LL BE UP INA
MINUTE

HARRY

Youre out of your mind Helen
All it takes is a minute
those things get in up there and
it’s too late to change your
mind Don’t you see that
Can’t you see that we’re safe as
long as we keep that door sealed

up

HELEN
I don’t give a damn I don’t
care Harry I don’t care
anymore I want to get out of
here go upstairs see if
someone will help us maybe

Karen will be okay
Her shouting stops and she takes control of herself She
steps toward Harry and speaks in a calmer tone almost
pleading

HELEN
Harry please for justa
minute we’ll go up and see
what’s up there We’1ll hear

the radio and maybe we can figure
some way to get out of here

maybe with all of us we can make
it Harry

Harry his adamancy weakening somewhat takes a cigarette
form his mouth exhaling the last puff and drops it to the
floor He rubs it out with his foot The smoke comes in
a long stream through his pursed lips

Startlingly Tom’s voice penetrates again

TOM
Harry Hey Harry Ben
found a television upstairs Come
on up we’ll see the civil

defense broadcast on tv

HELEN

(Soothingly to Harry her

tone in attempt to relieve

the
onus Harry must feel in going
against his original decision)
Come on let’s go up
there’1ll be something on tv that
tells us what to do you can tell
them I wanted to come up

HARRY
(Acquiescing but with stolid
misgivings his eyes fasten
on her he pronounces his
words with what is almost

menace )
All right this is your
decision we’ll go up but

don’t blame me if we all get
killed
Her eyes fall away from his and she leads as they go up
the stairs The cellar door swings open Helen and Harry
step into the hallway Faltering they peer through the
entranceway into the living-room Harry standing behind
his wife is hostile Partially due to anger with himself
because he has reneged on his decision about the cellar
Helen too is over-wrought due to the emotional effect of
the recent argument and to the fact that she is about to
meet strange people in an anxious circumstance

But only Tom and Barbara are in the living-room and
Barbara overcome with nervous exhaustion is sleeping
fitfully on the couch

TOM
We can see the broadcast I
think if the tv works I

have to go help ben

Helen has gone immediately to Barbara looks down at her
sympathetically brushes back her hair and pulls the
overcoat around her shoulders

HELEN
Poor thing she must have been
through a lot

Harry during these moments has been flitting anxiously
all over the house from door to window to kitchen to
living-room checking out the actual degree of
security and worrying about imminence of attack at any
second

TOM
(To Helen)
I think her brother was killed out
there

BEN
(Yelling somewhat peeved
from upstairs)
Tom hey Tom Are you gonna
give me a hand with this thing

Tom startles aware of his procrastination and bolts for
the upstairs to help Ben Harry pausing momentarily in
his anxiety comes over to where his wife is looking after
Barbara

HELEN
Her brother was killed

HARRY
This place is ridiculous there’s
a million weak spots up here

(We hear sounds from upstairs of Tom and Ben struggling
with the television set They are making their way down
the steps)

HELEN
I don’t care there’s people
up here why don’t you do
something to help somebody

Harry not really hearing her is staring once more into
the gloom outside

HARRY
I can’t see a damn thing out
there there could be fifty
million of those things I can’t
see a thing that’s how much good
these windows do us

The truck-driver who with Tom has reached the landing with
the heavy television set has heard the last part of
Harry’s remark He glowers even as he moves with his end
of the burden but says nothing as he and Tom gingerly
deposit the TV in the center of the room They hunt for an
outlet find it then slide and walk the set until the cord
is close enough to be plugged in Ben kneels behind the set
to plug in the cord

HARRY
Wake that girl up if there’s
going to be a thing on the tube
she might as well know where she
stands i don’t wand anybody’s
life on my hands

HELEN
Harry stop acting like a
child
BEN
(On his feet finished with
plugging in the set)
I don’t want to hear anymore from

you mister if you stay up here
you’1ll take your orders from
me and that includes leaving
that girl alone she needs
rest she’s just about out of
her head as it is now now

we’re just going to let her sleep
it off and nobody’s going to
touch her unless i say so

Ben stares Harry down for at least a moment to ascertain
that he is at least temporarily silenced then his hand
plunges immediately to the television set He snaps it on
the occupants of the room jockey for vantage points and
there are a baited few seconds of dead silence as they all
wait to see if the set will actually warm up All eyes are
on the tube A hiss begins increases in volume Ben
cranks the volume all the way A glowing band appears and
spreads filling the screen

HELEN
It’s on it’s on

There are murmurs of excitement and anticipation But the
tube only shows nothing No picture no sound Just the
glow and hiss of the tube Ben’s hand races the tuning
dial through the clicks of the various stations

HARRY
Play with the rabbit-ears we
should be able to get something

Ben fusses with horizontal and vertical with brightness
and contrast On one station he finally gets sound He
adjusts the volume the picture tumbles he plays with it
and finally brings it in Full-Screen is a commentator in
the middle of a news report

(The people in the room settle back to listen)

TV COMMENTATOR

assign little credibility to
the theory that this onslaught is
a product of mass hysteria
Authorities advise utmost caution
until the menace can be brought
under absolute control Eyewitness
accounts have been investigated
and documented

TV COMMENTATOR
Corpses of vanquished aggressors
are presently being examined by
medical pathologists but autopsy
efforts have been hampered by the
mutilated condition of these
corpses Security measures
instituted in metropolitan areas
include enforced curfews and
safety patrols by armed
personnel Citizens are urged to
remain in their homes Those who
ignore this warning expose
themselves to intense danger from
the aggressors themselves and
from armed citizenry whose
impulse may be to shoot first and
ask questions later

(During the telecast there are mixed feelings and
reactions but these responses are sporadic and
infrequent Predominant mood of all involved is to learn
as much as possible from the telecast)

TV COMMENTATOR
Rural or otherwise-isolated
dwellings have most frequently
been the objective of frenzied
concerted attack isolated
families are in extreme
danger Escape attempts should be
made in heavily-armed groups and
by motor vehicle if possible
appraise your situation carefully
before deciding upon an escape
tactic Fire is and effective
weapon these beings are highly
flammable Escape groups should
strike out for the nearest urban
community Manned defense outpost
have been established on major
arteries leading into all
communities
These outposts are equipped to
defend refugees and to offer
medical and surgical
assistance Police and vigilante
groups are in the process of
combing remote areas in search and
destroy missions against all
aggressors These patrols are
attempting to evacuate isolated
families

TV COMMENTATOR
But rescue efforts are proceeding
slowly due to the increased
danger of nightfall and the sheer
enormity of the task rescue for
those in isolated circumstances
is highly undependable you should
not wait for a rescue party unless
there is no possibility of
escape If you are few against
many you will almost certainly be
overcome The aggressors are
irrational and demented their
sole urge is the quest for human
flesh Sheriff Conan W
McClelland of the county
department of public protection
was interviewed minutes after he
and his vigilante patrol had
vanquished several of the
aggressors we bring you now the
results of that interview

(Fade and segue to video-tape interview)

Open on wide shot A night scene Dense woods Posted
guards maintain the periphery of a small clearing

Sporadic gunfire can be heard in the distance Some of the
men smoke some talk in groups The area is illumined by a
large bonfire Sheriff McClelland is the focal figure
MCU so that as he talks we catch glimpses of activity in
the background He is shouting commands supervising
defense measures and the burning of the bodies at the same
time trying to answer reporter’s questions We cut or zoom
closer McClelland is pacing around not straying too far
because a lavaliere microphone is hanging on a cord around
his neck The crackle of the bonfire the shouts and the
bustle of activity can be constantly heard behind his
commentary As he talks he frequently turns away his
primary concern being his efforts in dealing with the
aggressors and controlling his search party

MCCLELLAND
(Taking up with a previously-
asked question)
yeah well this is rough
country for an evening hike
(he smiles)
but things ain’t going too
badly the men are taking it
pretty well we killed nineteen
of ‘em today right around this
general area these last three we
found trying to claw their way
into an abandoned mine shed
nobody in there but these things
just pounding and clawing trying
to bust their way in

(MORE )

MCCLELLAND
it’s funny in a way must’ve
thought there was people in
there we heard the racket and

came and blasted them down

REPORTER
What’s your opinion then can we
defeat these things

MCCLELLAND
There ain’t no problem only
problem is whether we can get to
‘em before they kill off all these
people but me and my men can
handle ‘em okay we ain’t lost
nobody or suffered any
casualties all you gotta do is
shoot for the eyes you can tell
anybody out there all you
gotta do is draw a sharp bead and
shoot for the eyes or beat
‘em down ‘n lop their heads
off

REPORTER
Then I’d have a decent chance
even if I was surrounded by two or
three of them

MCCLELLAND
If you had yourself a club or
a good torch you could hold ‘em
off or burn ‘em to death they
catch fire like nothin’ go up
like wax paper but the best
thing is to shoot for the
eyes don’t wait for us to
rescue you ‘cause if they get
you too far outnumbered you’ve had
it We’re doin’ our best but
we only got so many men anda
whole lot of open country to
comb

REPORTER
But you think you can bring things
under control
MCCLELLAND
We got things in our favor now
It’s only a question of time We
ain’t for certain how many there
are of them things but we
know that when we find ‘em we’re
able to kill ‘em so it’s a matter
of time they’re weak but
there’s pretty many of ‘em
don’t wait for no rescue party
arm yourself to the teeth get
together in a group and try and
make it to a rescue station

that’s the best way but if
you’re alone you got to set stock
still and wait for help and

well try like hell to get there
before they do

(Scene fades segues back to live announcer)

MCCLELLAND
(Emphasizing his point even
as scene fades out)

tell ‘em to shoot for the
eyes that’1ll stop these
bojobbers

COMMENTATOR
You have heard Sheriff Conan W
McClelland for the county
department of public protection
this is your civil defense
emergency network with reports
every hour on the hour for the
duration of this emergency
Remain in your homes Keep all
doors and windows locked Do not
under any circ

(Ben reaches over and clicks off the television)

TOM
Why’d you click it off for

BEN
The man said they only come on
every hour we heard all we
need to know We gotta get out of
here
HELEN
he said the rescue stations have
doctors and medical supplies
If we could get there they could
help Karen

HARRY

(Scoffing)
How’re we gonna bust outta here
we got a sick kid two women
one of ‘em outta her head and
three men And there’s a million
of
them things outside

TOM
Willard should have a checkpoint
there about seventeen miles
from here

BEN

(Excited)

You from here you know this
area

TOM
Yeah I was workin’ in the
cemetery across the road I’m
the caretaker two of them
things attacked me and i
hightailed it over here found
everybody wiped out not too
long after these other people
fought their way in here I was

scared but I opened the basement
door and let them in

(Unbeknownst to everybody else Barbara has been sitting
up listening now she speaks startling them and gathering
their attention She has come down from her hysteria but
is very weak)

BARBARA
You work in the cemetery My
brother is over there

HELEN
You poor thing (Rushes to
Barbara comforting) My boy is
hurt too we have to get toa
rescue station the television
told us we have to try and
escape
HARRY
Well I think we ought to stick
right here and wait fora

rescue party He said if you’re
few against many you don’t have a
chance We can’t tramp
seventeen miles through those
things

BEN
We ain’t got to tramp My truck’s
right outside the door

This stops Harry There is a moment of silence

BEN
But i’m just about out of
gas There’s a pump near the

shed outside but it’s locked

TOM
(Becoming more enthused
seeing possibilities)
The key ought to be around
somewhere there’s a big key-
ring in the basement

HARRY
(Jumps up)
I’m gonna go look the keys
are labeled
(He bolts for the cellar)

BEN
Is there a fruit-cellar

HARRY
Yeah why

BEN
We’re gonna need lots of jars
We can make molotov cocktails
scare those things back then
fight our way to the pump and gas
up the truck

TOM
We’re gonna need kerosene
There’s a jug of that in the
basement too

HELEN
Barbara and ican help We can
rip up sheets and things

HARRY
(Clomps up from the cellar)
Here’s the key-ring The pump key
is marked with a piece of tape

BEN
Good that settles that
question but we should take a
crowbar anyway in case the

key doesn’t work The crowbar can
double as a weapon for whoever
goes with me But I don’t want to
get all the way out there and find
out the pump won’t open

TOM
I’ll go you and me can fight
our way to the pump The women
can stay in the cellar and take
care of the kid We should have
a stretcher bBarbara and
Helen can do that

BEN
Harry you’re gonna have to guard
the upstairs Once we inboard the
door those things can get in here
easy But me and tom have to get
in too after we get back here
with the truck You’ve got to
guard the door and unlock it for
us Then we’ll board it up as fast
as we can ‘cause those things are
gonna come fast on our heels
If we don’t get back well then
you’1ll be able to see from
upstairs and you can barricade
the door again and go to the
basement You can sit down
there and wait for a rescue party

HARRY
I want the gun then it’s the
best thing for me to use You’re
not going to have time to stop and
aim

BEN
(Adamantly)
I’m keeping this gun nobody
else lays a hand on it I found

it and it’s mine

HARRY
You don’t care what happens to
uS How do we know you and
Tom won’t just take the truck and
cut out

BEN

(Glowering with controlled

anger )
That’s the chance you have to
take If we cut out you’ll have
your goddamn basement Like
youve been crying about all
along

HELEN
We’re going to die here if we
don’t all work together

BARBARA
My brother’s out there maybe
we can get him and bring him
back He’s just wounded
he’1ll be okay

HELEN
(Understanding)
That’s okay honey we’ll be
all right maybe your brother

will be too

BEN
Let’s get busy we’ve got a lot
to do if we’re gonna bust out of
here

He is on his feet taking command We fade out of the
scene

fade into new scene completion of escape
preparations Tom is pouring kerosene into fruit jars
Helen is dipping twisted rag fuses in kerosene in the
bottom of a dish Barbara comes from the kitchen with more
jars drying them on the outside and putting them on the
table She and Helen begin working the kerosene soaked
fuses through holes which Tom has cut in the jar lids
Between them is a crude stretcher made of broomsticks and
torn sheets this presumable for the wounded girl Karen
The television is off but the radio drones lowly
repeating the recorded message The radio is on as a
monitor only that they may work and still keep up with
news that my affect their situation
BARBARA
I don’t know what to think about

my brother We have to get out
of here maybe we’ll find him
in Willard maybe he was able
to crawl to the car and get
away

HELEN
We have to think of ourselves
now it’s hard for you but
it’s all we can do my girl is
getting worse too I have to

get her to a doctor

HARRY
(Coming over checking the
stretcher making sure
the makeshift straps will hold)
Broomsticks and belt-buckles
and old sheets it seems to hold

okay I always hated the boy
scouts

TOM
It’ll be okay is there

anything open upstairs

HARRY
Some windows in the rooms ben is
unfastening the doors now

TOM
Well throw the cocktails from
upstairs just splash the
whole area with them That
should keep most of them away
while we make a break for the

truck

HELEN
Were ready here comes Ben
now

(Hears him coming down the
stairs)

Ben the gun strapped around his back is carrying a
crowbar and claw-hammer He walks around checking
preparations smiles at Barbara glad to see she’s a little
better

BEN
Things are ready up there Now me
and tom will un-board the front

door Harry you take the two
women upstairs Carry the molotov
cocktails with you Soon as

the door’s unbarred we can throw
those things all over the

place Make sure they catch
fire good then the women bust
down here and get in the cellar
don’t forget the stretcher

When we hear your footsteps on the
stairs me and tom’1ll be gone
It’1ll be up to you Harry

youve gotta watch this door

Got yourself a good length of
pipe

HARRY
I have a pitchfork

BEN

Good okay
Tom and Ben go over to the door The others gather fruit-
jars etc and sneak quietly to the un-boarded room
upstairs Tom and Ben are left alone Tom is soaking a
table-leg in kerosene ready to light it for use as a
torch They fall to work on the door the painstaking
work of quietly undoing the barricade They do not want to

give alarm to the lurking things outside With crowbar and
claw-hammer very carefully both men working on each
separate piece of lumber they undo the barricade Each
nail-creak is a menace They are alert to the constant
danger

They finish and watch posting themselves anxiously by the
door Shadowy figures lurk in the dark outside Tom and
Ben wait for the Molotov shower to begin

A cry is heard a window flies open the first fiery blaze
light in the yard More follow some aimed for the
creatures themselves One of two catch fire the others
start to back away the entire field is lit up

bombs shower from upstairs

HARRY
(Shouting from upstairs
slamming the door to the
room he was in)
That’s all Ben run for it
His voice echoes as Tom and Ben burst into the yard They
are armed with torches and with the gun They leap into
the truck Tom plunges a torch into the chest of an
attacker who immediately catches fire and goes down na
blaze clutching the torch

The truck starts up and careens in a u-turn for the old
shed Attackers fall away as it starts out Ben aims
fires several shots most miss as the truck jounces toward
the gas pump across the yard But one creature goes down
at the front of the gas pump near the old shed Tom and
Ben leap out Attackers are starting to make their way to
them from across the yard Tom fumbles with the key to the
locked pump Ben shoves him back hurriedly aims the gun
the gun fires blowing the lock to pieces Gas spurts
all over the place creatures advance gas still
spurting Tom crams the nozzle into the mouth of the gas
tank in the back of the truck Ben crouches and level off
with his weapon an approaching attacker goes down

but more are coming on Tom’s torch has inadvertently
set fire to the doused truck the flames begin to lick
and spread the attackers gather in force ever
closer Tom leaps into the flaming truck it skids and
lurches across the yard Ben shouts to no avail

the flaming truck speeds away driven by the panicked

Tom several of the things are upon Ben he
thrashes and pounds them with torch and gun ignoring
Tom he has to try and fight his way back to the

house

From inside the house the panicked and cowardly Harry has
seen only pieces of the action He has been darting back
and forth from door to window trying to see what has been
happening outside from his viewpoint the escape
attempt has met with total doom He has seen the truck
catch fire driven away by Tom Ben appears to be
overwhelmed

Harry runs again to the door He sees the truck
completely in flames speeding away from the house toward
a small rise Back to the kitchen window Ben is
about to be overcome things all around him

Harry does not see as Tom jumps from the burning truck to

be seized by attacking ghouls The truck continues
unmanned over the far rise and explodes violently
the noise and flame shattering the night Several

ghouls are at the front door trying to beat their way into
the house From inside Harry is in complete terror He
cannot hold out allis lost he panics and bolts
for the cellar

But Ben has slugged his way through the attackers on the
porch he is pounding for admission at the front door
He turns and with a powerful lunge kicks the last
attacker off the porch On the rebound he plows his
shoulder against the door It crashes open the lock
broken and Ben bursts through in time to catch Harry at
the cellar door but there is no time Ben frantically
turns to re-boarding the door His eyes meet Harry’s for
an instant then they both fall to work They board
up the door they are temporarily safe they turn
and look at each other sweat streaming from each

face Harry knows what is coming

Ben’s fist crashes against Harry’s face he is driven
back one punch following another until Ben corners him
clenching his lapels against the wall Ben’s words
spit out each work punctuated by an additional slam of
Harry against the wall

BEN
You rotten next
time you try something

like that I’11 kill you

Ben slams him one final time and he slides down the wall
crumples on the floor His face is swollen he is streaming
blood Ben is already at the cellar door

BEN
(Pounding)
Come on up it’s us its all
over Tom is dead

Fade out

The survivors are gathered in the living-room Barbara and
Helen are slumped on the sofa Overwhelming mood of
hopelessness and despair Harry sulks in a corner his
head slung back his face swollen he is holding an ice-
pack against his eye His good eye follows Ben who is
pacing about the room when Ben’s pacing takes him to the
kitchen or to some area out of Harry’s sight the good eye
nervously relaxes Ben’s movements make virtually the only
sound he is checking the defenses by force of old habit
rather than hope The rifle is slung on his back For a
long time we well on the scene on the absolute
dejectedness of the prisoners within the barricaded

house Ben paces from door to kitchen to window he
starts to go upstairs stops checks himself goes to the
door again he looks at his watch
BEN
Ten minutes to three there’1ll
be another broadcast in ten

minutes

Nobody says anything Ben pulls back the curtain his eyes
grow suddenly wide but he watches for a long moment

(We see his view of the outside)

There are many ghouls lurking in the shadows of the
hanging trees Some of the things are in the open much
nearer to the house than they dared come before Remains
of charred bodies are dimly apparent in various parts of
the lawn But Ben’s eyes are fastened on a more grisly
scene at the edge of the lawn in the moonlight several

ghouls are devouring what was once Tom They rip and
tear into aspects of his body ghoulish teeth

biting into Tom’s arms and hands Ben stares
fascinated and repulsed

With a convulsive movement his fingers release the curtain
he turns shaken and faces the others beads of
perspiration dripping from his forehead

BEN
Don’t don’t anyone of you
look out there You won’t like

what you see

Harry’s good eye fastens on Ben watches him satisfies and
contemptuous to see the big man weaken Ben moves for the
television clicks it on Barbara’s scream pierces the
room Ben leaps back from the television She is on
her feet screaming uncontrollably

BARBARA
Well never get out of here
none of us we’ll never get
out of her alive Johneee
Johneee oh oh
god mone of us none of
us help oh god
god

Before anyone can move to her she chokes up as suddenly as
she began and slumps sobbing violently to the couch

Her face buried in her hands Helen tries to soothe her
but great sobs come wracking from deep within she
grows gradually quiet the sobs diminish but she remains
slumped on the couch her face covered with her hands
Helen covers her with the overcoat but the action seems
futile Barbara makes no movement whatsoever

Ben allows himself to sink very slowly into a chair in
front of the TV Harry’s good eye goes from Barbara to
Ben His eye fastens on the gun which Ben lowers butt
first to the floor and leans across his legs Ben threads
his arm through the fringed sling and maintains his grip
on the fore-piece Harry watches

HELEN
(Getting up announces)
I’m going to the cellar to take
care of Karen
(She bends over places her
hand on Barbara)

Come on honey come and talk
to me it’1ll make you feel
better

But Barbara makes no response Helen turns and starts for
the cellar door she has to squeeze past Harry’s chair
Furtively his eye on Ben Harry touches her and pulls her
towards him She too watches Ben she knows something is
up Ben remains transfixed before the TV he is lost in
thought his mind drifts somewhere There is nothing
on the screen just a dull glow and low hiss over scanning
lines and static He has turned the set on too early

HARRY
(Whispering cautiously and
quickly to Helen)

I’ve got to get that gun we
can go to the cellar You have
to help me

He has let the ice-pack come away from his eye We see its
swollen blackened condition and the desperation n his
face Ben still gazes at the TV Worried about the
possibility that Ben might catch them in the act and not
really sympathizing with Harry Helen pulls away but she
leans her face to Harry’s and whispers quickly

HELEN
I’m not going to help you
haven’t you had enough he’d

kill us both

She goes to the cellar and on the way has to pass behind
Ben’s chair she hesitates her eyes fall on the gun the
sling is wound around Ben’s arm We study her face it is
not clear whether she would have taken it or not But she
makes no attempt She opens the door and goes down into
the cellar Harrys eye follows her as she leaves

As Helen reaches the bottom of the cellar stairs she looks
up and her face shows startlement a shaken smile

her daughter is sitting up propped on her elbows on the
workbench table

HELEN
Karen

She starts for her but stops there is something
strange her face turns slowly toward her we see
the ghoulish look in her eye She is DEAD She begins
to rise slowly terrifyingly her features grotesque

the coat that was her blanket begins to fall away her
eyes stare through Helen And beyond her slowly

agonizingly she raises herself from the table

Helen terrified begins to back away across the cellar
her hand falls on a knife her child creeps toward her
She moves a large packing crate trying to block her

path trying to stave the confrontation but she is
too late she springs It appears as though the knife
will be driven into her breast

But on the spring we cut to the upstairs where
simultaneously a scream pierces the room An assault has
begun the things are beginning to break into the house

They have gotten into the den and are hammering at the
barricaded door the walls are starting to come
apart

Ben is on his feet trying to reinforce the barricades
with hammer and crowbar he works furiously

BEN
Harry Harry give mea
hand over here

Harry comes over behind Ben and instead of helping rips
the gun from Ben’s back Holding the gun on Ben Harry
backs toward the cellar Ben turns around panicked the
things are breaking into the house

BEN
What are you up to man We’ve got
to keep those things out

HARRY
(Backing away)
Now we’ll see who’s going to shoot
who I’m going to the
cellar and you can rot up
here you crazy bastard

His hand goes behind him to the cellar door but at
that moment the ghoulish Karen leaps upon him with great
thud Karen is at Harry’s throat Ben is able to grab
the gun he levels off trying to hit the kid but
a sudden wrench of the two struggling bodies and Ben
misses Harry screams a great clot of blood
appears at his chest clutching the wound he begins to
go down he falls through the entranceway to the cellar
stairs he reels grabs the banister and begins to
descend We see his view as he falls

reeling head-first down the stairs Ben
meantime has flung the kid Karen with one heave
against the wall but things have broken into the
house Everywhere the barricades are coming apart

Barbara with the hysteria of revenge has flung herself
into the attack She smashes a chair against one of the

aggressors it goes down she smashes and smashes
it on the floor until there is nothing left of
the chair she comes up still swinging fighting with

Ben against the things that have come into the house

It is quite apparent that they cannot hold out The
attack rages they are overwhelmed Ben grabs
Barbara and pulls her after him toward the cellar she

is lashing and swinging beating at an attacker even as he
drags her away

Ben flings open the door to the cellar and Helen is at
his throat he brings the gun up between their
struggling bodies until the muzzle is against her throat
and squeezes the trigger she is blown halfway across
the room Ben and Barbara run down the stairs

But Harry is sprawled in a pool of blood on the

floor He is dead but beginning to rise Ben
pushed Barbara back she turns her head away Ben
raises the gun and we study this as three evenly-spaced
shots rip the room Ben is almost glad to kill

Harry he turns to Barbara breathing hard she
collapses against him and begins to sob

We hear faint pounding against the barricaded cellar door
But it is holding The creatures cannot get in

The screen is black There are the sounds of birds

fainter sounds of dogs human voices Fade up quickly
sunrise The morning after the siege The sky is
clear the rising sun is bright and warm there is

dew on the high grass of a meadow

Men with dogs and guns reworking their way up form the
woods that surround the meadow We do not see the posse at
first we merely hear their sounds shouts muffled
talk panting and straining of dogs against leashes

Sheriff McClelland’s posse A few men some with German
Shepherds on leashes finally come up out of the woods and
onto the edge of the sunlit dewy meadow The wet grass
has dampened the boots and trouser-legs of the men

McClelland is perhaps the third man up from the surrounding
thicket He is a heavy man mustached breathing hard
because of his weight and the difficult job of leading the
posse through the night He is armed with shotgun and
pistol and a belt of ammunition strung over his shoulder
He pauses looks back into the woods and mops perspiration
from his brow with a balled-up dirty handkerchief

MCCLELLAND
(Shouting back at the men
still working their way
toward the clearing)
Come on let’s step lively
now never can tell what we’1l
run into up here

He accosts a man just climbing out of the woods The man
wears an improvised sweat-band carries a rifle and side-
arm and has a walkie-talkie strapped on his back

MCCLELLAND
You keeping in touch with the
squad-cars George

GEORGE
(Breathing hard adjusting
the straps and burden across
his back)
Yeah they know where we are
They should be intercepting us at
the house

MCCLELLAND
Good these men is dog-
tired they can use some rest
and hot coffee (He looks

back to the men moving up from
behind He shouts) Let’s push
along now the squad cars’1l
be waiting with coffee and
sandwiches at the house

The men push on across the field Inside the house
Ben and Barbara have been dozing on chairs in the
basement Ben wakes abruptly thinking he has heard
something but he isn’t sure He sits up and listens
more closely from far off there is the sound of a
dog Ben listens for a long time but hears nothing
more

Outside the meadow has become the apron of a cemetery the
one Barbara and John had come to with the flowers for their
father The posse is advancing threading its way among
the grave-markers A man finds John’s skeletal remains near
the spot where he had fallen Down a dirt road and up a
short grade is Barbara’s car with the smashed window

MCCLELLAND
Looks like this guy’s car
poor fellow never hada

chance

The men pass through the cemetery and over the wall where
several squad cars are waiting on the road There are also
one or two motorcycle patrolmen One of the men dismounts
and hails McClelland

PATROLMAN
Hi Connie how’s things
goin’

McClelland advances and shakes hands stops awhile mops
his brow again The men begin to catch up and regroup
The posse fills the bend in the narrow road

MCCLELLAND
Sure glad to see you fellas
Charlie we been at it all
night but I don’t want to
break ‘til we get to the house
over there We might be
lollygaggin’ around whole somebody
needs our help we’1ll see first
then stop and get some
coffee

PATROLMAN
Anything you say
Connie wees
Inside the house Ben has sneaked up to the top of the
cellar stairs He listens there very intently not
wanting to open the door because creatures may still be in

the house This time for sure he hears gunshots and
mumbled sound of what must be the voices of approaching
men There is even what sounds like a car engine Ben

bolts excitedly down the stairs

Ben wakes the girl

BEN
Barbara Barb here
honey there’s men
outside I can hear them
they must be here to rescue
us
Outside we see the cause of the gunshots The posse is

flushing out ghouls from the pump-house and surrounding
area The squad cars have driven up The posse is
advancing across the lawn guardedly toward the partially-
destroyed old farmhouse The men crouch and sneak up

slowly keeping their eyes fastened on the house A loud
sudden noise stops them they watch stopped in their
tracks
MCCLELLAND
Shoot for the eyes boys like
I told you before always aim

right for the eyes

Inside ready to shoot or swing Ben has slammed open the
cellar door The force of his shoulder against the door
has carried him into the living-room Nothing

Only the ramshackle and destruction form the recent siege
He edges his way through the twisted wreckage and
overturned furniture toward the front door There is no
light in the place His hand finds what is left of the
curtain He pulls it back and starts to peer out

but a shot right out Ben reels driven back

a circle of blood on his forehead right between his

eyes

Barbara’s scream is heard from downstairs
simultaneously McClelland shouts his face flushed with
anger

MCCLELLAND
Damn it what’d you shoot for I

told you to be careful there
might be people in there

MAN WHO FIRED THE SHOT
Naw this place is demolished
there ain’t nobody in there

PATROLMAN
I’m sure I heard a girl’s
scream from the basement

maybe

Several men have advanced to kick in the front door They
step back and peer cautiously inside Their faces search
the room A patch of sunlight from the opened door
falls partially on Ben He is dead The men look down at
him but step past him toward the cellar They do not know
he was a man From the cellar they hear muffled sobs
McClelland enters and begins to inch his way down the
stairs

MCCLELLAND
Anybody down there
(He shouts)

He draws his pistol inches his way down the stairs At
the bottom he confronts Barbara sitting wide-eyed ina
chair McClelland raised his pistol aims it for her

head but something stops him a tear in her
eye he lowers the weapon
MCCLELLAND
It’s all right men come on
down it’s just a girl down
here

He goes to Barbara bends over her looks at her begins to
help her up

Closing scene with titles and credits Burning of bodies
in the yard of the old house Perhaps the burning of the
house itself In the background against scene of
McClelland draping his jacket around Barbara and bringing
coffee to her lips we see Ben’s body on a stretcher
carried by two men they lift it into the rear of a
station-wagon

MCCLELLAND
It’s too bad an accident
the only loss we had the whole

night
