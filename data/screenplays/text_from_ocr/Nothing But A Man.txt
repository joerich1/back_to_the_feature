Music from the pool hall fades and we pick up the strains of gospel
singing
from a nearby church

INT CHURCH

The choir is singing Precious Lord The women are spirited and
the

congregation in the small wooden building is alive to the music

Duff appears in the open doorway and stops to listen
When the song ends REVEREND DAWSON rises from his chair

Long tables laden with food are lit by strings of lightbulbs The
sound of a

gospel piano from inside the church

A smiling middle-aged woman has taken Duff in tow and leads him
over toa
young woman (JOSIE) who is serving food

WOMAN

him some of that good food Hes a fine young
man
(on her way)

Duff studies Josie with a smile She is clearly middle class While
she puts

food on a paper plate she glances at him - matching his ironic
detachment

with her own She hands him the plate

DUFF

BIRMINGHAM ALLEYWAY (Night)

From the interior of Duffs car we see Duff come out of Effie
Simms house

carrying James Lee through the rain He deposits the scared-looking
boy in the

front seat and gets in on the drivers side James Lee shrinks as
far away

from Duff as the seat allows

DUFF
(with a kindly grin)
That windows broke boy You stay over there
youre gonna get awful wet
INT MOVING CAR (Dawn)
The sun is coming up through the trees James Lee is asleep on the
front seat

DUFF AND JOSIES LIVING ROOM

Duff brings in the sleeping boy and puts him down on the sofa Then
he leaves

to get his belongings

Josie has woken up and comes in from the bedroom in her nightgown
She sees
James Lee and leans over him

JOSIE
(softly)
Hi

James Lee opens his eyes
Josie hears Duff enter and turns to him They come together and

hold each
other for a long moment

DUFF
Aint gonna be easy baby - but its gonna be
all right
Josie is weeping
DUFF

Baby I feel so free inside
