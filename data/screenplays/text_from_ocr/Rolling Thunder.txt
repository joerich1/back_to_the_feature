TWO QUOTES

PRE-CREDITS

Film opens with two FADE-IN FADE-OUT quotes white
letters against a black field

There is NO SOUND

FIRST QUOTE

In the first two years after repatriation
534 percent of the deaths of WWII ex-POWs
held in the Orient were attributed to violent
causes murder suicide in the act of crime
or on the highway This was a violent death
rate four times the normal expectancy

--From the report by the
Committee on Veterans Medical
Problems September 1954

SECOND QUOTE
Our returning prisoners—of-war are examples
of the high moral fiberwhich will help make
this a nationfree from crime

--Richard M Nixon Report on
Crime in America March 14 1972

A PAUSE and then FADING-IN against the black field
red letters reading

ROLLING THUNDER
A short SILENCE and the CREDIT SONG begins
CUT TO
CHARLIE COMES MARCHING HOME

CREDITS

CREDITS are played over shots of Viet Nam POWs disem-
barking at Travis Air Force Base

Even before we cut from the title card we hear the
sharply punctuated beginning of a Country and Western
song Go Hide John by Red Sovine

Go Hide John is an upbeat hard-driving song full of
violence and vengeance In the song Sovine a sixtiesh
redneck singer with a sandpaper voice belts out the anger
of a returning soldier When he sings But Im alive
his voice literally ripples with defiance

The credits are interspersed in a long emotional sequence
and hopefully well be able to play all of the lyrics of
Go Hide John (the song runs 245) In any event the
lyrics are worth listening to

GO HIDE JOHN

Thank you Operator

-(a beat)
Hello Marie Its me Im back
Go Hide John Im gonna get him
I swear Im gonna get him

I wrote you how I felt from Can Ranh Bay
He burned his card then stole your love

away
Now Im back on the sweet side of the
pond

And I thought Id call and tell you go
hide John

Hide him well and tell him Hell waits on
an airplane

I depart these California skies at dawn
You thought the War and all its fire would
kill me in the jungle

But Im alive its time to go hide John

Oh youll get your divorce I promise

you
But old John wont be in church to
say I do
GO HIDE JOHN”
(contd)

He helped you cash and drink up all
my bonds

And I thought Id e¢all and tell you
go hide John

Hide him well and tell him Hell waits
on an airplane

I depart these California skies at dawn
Upon my word the next big bird his
troubles comes to Houston

And I thought Id call and tell you

go hide John

I Love you Marie and I guess I still do
(a beat

But Im gonna get him I swear Im gonna

get him

Meanwhile we see the familiar scenes of returning POWs

A giant Air Force Starlighter taxis up to a 40-foot red
carpet A cluster of high-ranking AF anxiously stand by

A pushing crowd of wives children and relatives strains
for the first glimpse of the returning prisoners Some
are nervously talkative some are impatiently silent
all are nearing a frenzy of anticipation

Homemade SIGNS are sprinkled through the crowd They
read

WELCOME HOME WERE ALL PROUD OF YOU
BEAUTIFUL MEN
JESUS LOVES YOU

OUR HEROES

Finally the giant steel door slowly opens A CHEER
goes up A POW cautiously sticks his head out of the
plane The crowd as if through some secret signal
begins singing God Bless America in unison

The first POW walks down the ramp He is greeted en-
thusiastically by the AF representative LATER he
makes a short speech

Instead of peaking the scene instead becomes more lyric
and emotional In SLOWING MOTION and TRACKING SHOT we
see shots of
4

--An ecstatic POW wife breaks through the restraining
line of soldiers and rushes into the arms of her
awaiting husband

-Another sinks to her knees with tears of joy

-A POW being carried from the plane on a stretcher
pulls himself up and waves to the crowd

-Tearful strangers embrace

-A POW holds up a handmade sign reading

GOD BLESS AMERICA”

The returning POWs look gaunt worn but in good health
Then stepping off the plane appears LT COLONEL CHARLES
RANE our hero He instantly catches our eye Tough
individualistic unsmiling About 35-45 He makes
apologies to no man

Passing through the reception line he is enthusiastically
greeted by his wife JANET and twelve-year-old son MARK
Janet quickly introduces Mark and Rane since they do not
instantly recognize each other

CLIFF wearing a policemans uniform stands in the crowd
watching them closely

Among the tight uneasy faces of the returning prisoners
we also see the attractive young face of JOHNNY VOHDEN
a POW we will meet later

Vohden is likewise greeted by his family his wife
young son and daughter sister and brother-in-law

LATER Rane rides away in an AF car with Janet and Mark
CUT TO AERIAL SHOT of Corpus Christi Texas
END CREDITS

CUT TO
THE INTERVIEW

Charles Rane and AF Colonel WILLIAM MAXWELL are seated
behind microphones on a long interview table A banner
behind their heads reads

CORPUS CHRISTI WELCOMES HOME
LT COL CHARLES RANE

Name plates on the table identify Rane and Maxwell
Ranes skyblue uniform is draped with a multi-colored
assortment of medals and decorations More medals are
placed in an orderly row on the table before him

Col Maxwell acts only in an advisory capacity As Ranes
Air Force psychiatrist he is assigned to help talk
him down during this transition period

The CAMERA remains STATIC throughout the interview It
does not pan or zoom we do not see the reporters camera-
men or photographers

Charles Rane seems ill-at-ease throughout the interview
He tries to be cooperative but really isnt equipped to
handle these kind of intellectual questions yet He
seems to have lost the knack of normal conversation

The unmoving camera emphasizes his uneasiness Questions
jump out of nowhere anonymous TV cameras grind behind
banks of lights flashbulbs pop erratically

The tenor of the interview indicates that Rane has been
back home at least a couple weeks

REPORTER 1 (0S)
How the folks in Corpus been treating
you Colonel Rane

Rane has a delayed reaction It seems to take him a few
extra seconds to respond to anything

RANE
Good Yeah Good

after seven years in Hanoi

RANE
(pause)
Nice Real nice

inspiration to all the prisoners

No
(a beat)
Not really

REPORTER 4 (0S)
Navy Comdr Jack Abel told reporters
that you were strung upside down for
three days by the North Vietnamese

Col Maxwell interrupts

MAXWELL

‘There is an embarrassed silence

REPORTER 4 Well Is it true

RANE

REPORTER 5 (0S)

RANE

REPORTER 6 (0S)
What methods did they use to coerce
you
RANE
You know all the stuff youve
been reading about

REPORTER 7 (0S)
Was it true the prisoners were fed
the same food as the guards

RANE
No That was just another fiction

REPORTER 8 (0S8)
Do you blame the GIs who made anti-
war statements

Rane hesitates for a moment and looks at Col Maxwell

RANE
Well I dont know what to say
about that I only did what I
felt I must
(looks back at Maxwell)
But some other fellers hold a
grudge Ill tell you that

REPORTER 9 (05S)
Jane Fonda said recently that the
POWs lied when they said they had
been tortured because they were
obviously in good physical condition

RANE
(interrupting)
That bitc

Ranes eyes flash Maxwell immediately interrupts him

MAXWELL
(under his breath)
Charlie

Rane calms down

REPORTER 9 (0S)
Well what do you think of Ms Fondas
statement

RANE
(hack-coughing)
People like that only made our
mountain higher to climb Those
anti-war people They just hurt
We were in there longer cause of
them
REPORTER 10 (0S)
What do you think of President
Nixons policies

RANE
I support the President 100 He
brought us Peace With Honor I
love this country and nobody could
make me say different

REPORTER 11 (0S)
Getting back to your treatment under
the North Vietnamese Is it true
that before 1969 when the conditions
improved somewhat you were beaten
given electric shocks forced to
crawl through latrines filled with
excrement

RANE
(looks toward Maxwell)
Id rather not talk about it you
know When we talk too much about
it we either get angry or just cry

REPORTER 11 (0S)
But surely you men being such heroes

RANE
(interrupting)
You dont understand I never did
anything heroic I survived All
the heroes died

REPORTER 12 (0S)
Is it true you and your wife have
filed for divorce

MAXWELL
No it isnt true and I think that
question is entirely out of order

REPORTER 13 (0S)
The businessmen of Corpus Christi
we have been told have given you
a brand new Cadillac Plus you
have received a color TV and many
other gifts In addition the
government recently gave you a
124000 check for back pay for
hazardous duty What are you going
to do with all this money
RANE

(determined)
Well I aint gonna put it in no
bank thats for sure Thats all
that stands between me and seven
years of dead time Thats all I
got to show Im keeping it and
Im gonna spend it all on me

Col Maxwell stands up indicating the interview is over
He doesnt seem too pleased with the outcome but Rane
is relieved

CAMERA follows Maxwell and Rane as they work through the
crowd of reporters photographers and onlookers toward
the exit

Janet and Mark surrounded by AF personnel wait by the
exit

As Maxwell and Rane elbow through the crowd a statuesque
TEXAS GIRL wearing yellow slacks and stacks of blond hair
‘walks toward Charlie She keeps her physical assets up
front where everybody can see them

She brushes herself into Rane he looks back somewhat
startled Thrusting her breasts into his medals she
wraps her arms around him and says

TEXAS GIRL
Oh you men are so brave

Flashbulbs pop as photographers catch the scene Rane
smiles awkwardly and the Texas Girl disappears into the
crowd After she leaves Rane realizes she has put a
piece of paper into his hand He glances at it It
reads

Linda Forchet TR4-3265

He slips the paper into his pocket and greets his wife
and son at the doorway

cur TO

MEMORY WALL

Maxwells AF car pulls up in front of the Ranes small
isolated ranch-style farmhouse on the outskirts of
Corpus Christi

A bright red El Dorado Cadillac convertible (top down)
sits in the dirt driveway

Maxwell Janet Rane and Mark get out of the car Mark
and Rane lead the way as they walk up the sidewalk

RANE
Change your clothes and well throw
a football around okay

MARK
Sure

Rane and his son have little in common but blood In
seven years they have developed very different sensi-
bilities Mark wears his hair shoulder-length and
dreams of being Mick Jagger Charlie assumes all young
boys idolize baseball players and astronauts

They walk into INT LIVING ROOM Mark goes into his room
to change and Rane wanders out into the back yard The
press conference is still unreeling in his mind

Maxwell and Janet stand in the living room and talk

Behind Janet above the Scotchguard sofa is Janet and
Marks Memory Wall The Memory Wall consists of
chronological rows of pictures of Charles Rane taken
before and during his capture These pictures served
to keep his memory alive

The living room bears a womans touch frilly curtains
knick-knacks In one corner stands a new 25 TV stacked
with unopened presents addressed to Lt Col Rane”
Several POW reorientation pamphlets including a
Dictionary of Slang rest on the coffee table

Maxwell waits until Charlie is out of earshot

MAXWELL
How has he been Janet

JANET
Hes doing all right I think
He should get out more often
(MORE )
ll

JANET (CONTD)
When he doesnt have anything to
do he just sits all day Ive
seen him spend an hour making the
bed

MAXWELL
Thats not too unusual He has
to make the transition at his own

speed

(a beat)
How much longer will you be living
here

Janet is a handsome but somewhat bland woman All her
instincts are kind and generous but right now shes
trying to juggle two lives simultaneously

JANET
As long as he needs me A couple
more weeks a month if necessary
I just cant let him handle this
all alone

MAXWELL
How do Charlie and Cliff get along

JANET
Quite well actually cliff
thinks Charlies quite a hero

MAXWELL
He is
(a beat)
When will you and Cliff be getting
married

JANET
Sometime in the fall Im not
sure yet Theres no need to rush

MAXWELL

Well have to have a long talk about
this in a couple days Therell have
to be some sort of statement to the
press Everybodys interested in
Charlie

(excusing himself)
Ive got to run Ill just say
goodbye to Charlie

Maxwell gives Janet a polite kiss and walks out back

Maxwell walks across EXT BACKYARD toward the barn where
Charlie is standing Rane is poking around in the dirt
with his foot He turns as he hears Maxwell walking
toward him

RANE
Hey Bill

MAXWELL
Ive got to keep moving Rane
Dont forget the billboard thing
in the morning and we have a
meeting after that

RANE
I got it

MAXWELL
(touches his chest)
You still having the pain here

RANE
Comes and goes I see the Doc
regular

Maxwell nods Mark dressed in sneakers jeans and a
sweatshirt walks toward them with a football

MAXWELL
(to Mark)
Gonna throw some football Mark

MARK
It aint even football season

MAXWELL
You dont have to have seasons
for everything

MARK
Id rather be a surfer

RANE
(stepping back)
Throw it here Mark

MAXWELL
(excusing self)
See you later

Mark hurls the football awkwardly at his father Mark
isnt much of a Quarterback and the ball wobbles in
Ranes general direction -- but then Charlie isnt much
of an End either and he stabs at the football like a
man catching flies

After Maxwell exits Rane holding the football stands
and looks at his son not quite knowing what to do next

CUT TO

A GUEST FOR DINNER

SUPPERTIME that same day Janet Charlie Mark and
Cliff sit around the small kitchen table

Cliff Janets future husband is wearing his policemans
uniform He is about thirty and handsome in an average
sort of way His sharply starched blue uniform gives

him a sexiness he would not normally have

They pass around bowls of mashed potatoes peas and
roast beef For the moment each seems more interested
in eating than talking

On the wall behind Rane is a grease-spattered map of
Viet Nam with certain strategic locations circled with
a red Magic Marker

Finally Charlie breaks the silence

RANE
How is that new team they have
in Houston the Astros

CLIFF
(looking up)
I went to one of their games last
year -

MARK
They aint much good Baseballs
dumb anyway

CLIFF
(to Mark)
At least theyre better than those
Wahoos up in Dallas the Texas
Rangers Washington DCs rejects

Mark giggles there is an obvious rapport between he
and Cliff

JANET
Corpus aint part of Texas anyway

Janet is referring to a private joke between Cliff and
Mark who respond with short chuckles They dont mean
to cut Charlie out of their little jokes -- they just
dont know how to get him in

CLIFF
If they try to give us some of their
loser teams we should succede from
the state

JANET
Nothing succeeds like succession

They all giggle again

Theres a guest for dinner all right but it isnt cliff
- its Charlie Its as if he inadvertently walked in
on somebody elses family

RANE
They didnt even have that Astro
team when I was here before

CLIFF
Texas was the better for it too

Mark giggles again (everything Cliff says is funny to
him) and there is another awkward silence

RANE
(looking around)
I think Ill have a drink You
want a drink Cliff

CLIFF
(eating)
No not yet Charlie

Charlie reaches over to a nearby cabinet and pulls out a
quart of JandB Janet looks on disapprovingly as he pours
himself several fingers Taking a healthy swig he
feels the ripples of relaxation move through his body

RANE
I kinda like to see them Astros
play you know

CUT TO

MISS TAMMY AND THE EMPTY COFFIN

A large billboard somewhere in Corpus Christi reads

SEND A LETTER TO HANOI
RELEASE LT COL CHARLES RANE

Surrounded by local dignitaries and photographers Charles
Rane axe in hand stands at the base of the billboard

He poses awkwardly for the photographers before chopping
down the last leg of the billboard

A cluster of aging Veterans their uniforms dripping with
decorations beam with particular pride

The billboard falls and a CHEER goes up from the crowd

cUT TO INT COL MAXWELLS OFFICE Charles Rane sits
in a large padded chair talking with Col Maxwell It
is a psychiatrist-patient relationship a relationship
somewhat complicated by the fact however that they
are both wearing their uniforms

Rane rambles on speaking as if to no one but himself

RANE
You know Bill it took me three
days just to figure out how to tie
my damn shoes I feel like such an
ass

MAXWELL
Seven years is a long time Id
be happy if I knew which shoe
went where

RANE
Ah comeon Bill Dont be so
obvious

MAXWELL

Im supposed to be obvious Rane
So you can see it Because in the
end only you can help yourself

RANE
So what else is going to help me
Carting me around and praising me
for a bunch of crap I never did
I dont know if anything can help
RANE (CONTD)

Sometimes I cant sleep at night
and get up and feel I just gotta
tear something Like the Naval
Air Base -- wouldnt that be
something for your headlines Bill

(pause)
They owe me something you know
something more than money

MAXWELL
Why

RANE
You know

MAXWELL

A lot of people think the war
was immoral Do you think that
Charlie

RANE

(irritated)
Of course not But their money
dont solve everything either
Sometimes I think they sent back
an empty body and I wasnt in it
Just another coffin Im sick of
being a hero Im sick of being
all locked in

MAXWELL
Maybe its sex Maybe sex is the
way out

RANE
You said that before No it
aint sex Everythings sex
with you guys aint it

MAXWELL
Has the sex changed

RANE
No
MAXWELL
How is it

RANE
The same

MAXWELL

Thats not too unusual Sometimes
this can go on for six months or
more
RANE
Had a sex dream last night though
First in years Figurd youd like
to hear about it

MAXWELL
What was it about

RANE

For a while I had dreams about food
and medicine like before then I
stopped and I was afraid I was going
to have dreams about the torture and
all But last night I had a dream
and I was screwing Tammy Wynette on
a stairs She was leaning back
against the stairs wearing this
sort of fluffy yellow dress without
underpants I was wearing my
uniform with my pants half-way
down Miss Tammy sort of had her
dress hoisted above her waist She
had her hair stacked up in a sort
of curly-cue fashion and kept
going On ‘Ah u

(an embarrassed smile)
Does that mean anything Doc

MAXWELL
How did you know it was Miss Tammy

RANE

I came though Charlie Now that
means something dont it

(a beat)
I was always afraid Id dream I
wouldnt It was like Nam Id
dream I was going into combat and
Id get there and it was all over
Thats what it was like going to
Nam and not getting into combat
It was like getting in bed with a
beautiful woman and not being able
to come

MAXWELL
How did you know it was Miss Tammy

RANE
I just sorta knew I kept thinking
Wow this is gotta be Miss Tammy
Wynette She didnt even sing

MAXWELL
Do you like her singing

RANE
Oh yeah Shes my favoritist
singer I used to keep thinking
about that That Tammy or Loretta
Lynn would have a new song out
somewhere and I was too far away
to hear it I love that song
Apartment Number 9

MAXWELL
Did you tell Janet about the dream
RANE
No
MAXWELL
Why not
RANE
She wouldnt understand
MAXWELL
Why not
RANE

Shes a woman you know

cuT TO

PILLOW TALK

THAT NIGHT Rane stands in MARKS BEDROOM watching his
son sleep On the wall above Markts bed hangs a large
poster of Mick Jagger prancing a devils jig at Altamont
Charlie closes the door softly then exits

Rane walks into the MASTER BEDROOM Janet wearing a
sheer nightgown sits up in bed reading Coronet

Charlie strips down to his shorts and gets into bed
next to Janet The POW Dictionary of Slang rests
on the bedstand

Putting down her magazine Janet snuggles up to Charlie
Her nipples can be seen through the sheer blue fabric
of her nightgown

JANET
How was Dr Maxwell today

RANE
Fine I guess

She embraces him
JANET

You know I thought Id never have
you back in bed again

RANE
I never thought Id be back
JANET

RANE
Ill be all right
JANET
Its too bad it couldnt be
different
RANE
Its all right baby honest I

JANET

sometimes

She runs her hand up and down his leg underneath the
covers
JANET
(sexily)
You wanna try it huh

RANE
(hesitant )
Well I dont knowits just

JANET

RANE
Dr Maxwell says I shouldnt rush it

JANET
Oh

RANE

Janet renews her pseudo-sexual stimulation

JANET
But what about you Charlie It

RANE
If you can live with it I can live
without it
(weak smile)

Janets eyes fill up with pathos and sympathy

JANET
Oh Charlie Charlie

She embraces him

TIMECUT TO LATER THAT NIGHT The room is dark Char-
lie unable to sleep gets out of bed and begins dressing

CUT TO EXT DRIVE-IN THEATER Ranes big red Caddy
(top up) pulls into an outdoor theater The marquee
advertises DEEP THROAT-ADULTS ONLY

CUT TO Rane sits behind the wheel watching the film
The light from the screen is reflected on his face
MOANS and GROANS are heard OFF SCREEN He takes another
hit from his quart of JandB

Turning to his left Rane looks into the cars parked
nearby He sees DARK FORMS engaged in various stages
of necking and petting

Feeling someone staring at him he turns and looks to

his left there two cars away sits a YOUNG MAN hunched
in the front seat with a beer can in his hand The young
punks face is gaunt and drained of color He wears a
green plaid western shirt and Army jacket

Those who have read another script of mine titled
Taxi-Driver will recognize this young man His name

is Travis Bickle

Travis and Rane stare at each other for a moment two
fuses slowly burning down

cuUT TO

CLOTHES MAKE THE MAN

Charles Rane drives into Corpus Christi the next morning
in his long red Cadillac (top down) He is wearing a
red plaid work shirt

He parks the car and walks down the sidewalk toward
BRANNIGANS a fashionable mens clothing store

INSIDE Rane is greeted by BRANNIGAN the owner Bran-
nigan and his help are all nattily dressed Charlie looks
out of place in his comfortable flannel shirt and work
jeans and shoes

BRANNIGAN

Lt Colonel Rane Welcome Weve
all been waiting for you Colonel
Maxwell said you would be in
sometime this week

(pause)
We want you to feel right at home
and leave everything to us Dont
worry about a thing We will fix
you up so you look fantastic
Everythings on us its our
honor to be able to do this

Rane smiles politely and looks uncomfortable from side
to side

RANE
Well I appreciate this you know
I really do

Brannigan gestures for Charlie to follow

BRANNIGAN
Now just follow me I have just
the thing for you You will look
very nice in brown and we have the
latest styles I have just the suit
for you

Brannigan leads Rane toward a clothes rack

TIMECUT Rane fully dressed in a new suit shirt and
shoes stands before a tripartite mirror

Brannigan was right he does look fantastic He wears

a deep brown velvet suit a Cardin yellow-and-brown floral
patterned shirt and brown high-heeled shoes He is a
transformed man sexy debonair fresh out of the pages

of Gentlemens Quarterly
24

Charlie looks into the mirror recognizes that hes sup¥
posed to look sharp but jacked up on those goddamn
heels he just doesnt feel sharp

He starts to hack-cough but suppresses it

BRANNIGAN
This suit never looked better than
it does on you Lt Colonel Rane
(a beat 3
Try it out Walk around

Rane tests the fit of his new suit Unsteady on his two
inch heels Charlie walks with an uncertain gail

BRANNIGAN
(uncertain)
Do you like it How does it fit

Rane attempts to put Brannigan at ease

RANE
Oh it fits fine Real nice I
like it very much
(a beat)
And comfortable too

BRANNIGAN

Im so glad you like it

(a beat hesitant)
Ah Lt Colonel Rane would you mind
if we took a picture of you in your
new suit To hang in our window
Were very proud to have you as our
customer

Brannigan gestures to the rear of the store and young
man walks out with a camera and flash attachment

BRANNIGAN
Now Lt Colonel if youll just
sort of stand here in the middle
of the room
(gestures)

Rane walks to the center of the store feeling more like
a naked man in a bus terminal than a hero

BRANNIGAN
There thats fine
(to photographer)
All right Bob you stand over
there

Rane poses The photographer readies his camera

BRANNIGAN
You dont happen to have any medals
with you do you Lt Colonel It
would look sort of nice if we could
pin a medal or two on the front of
the suit A real touch of class

RANE
(apologetic)
No I dont I left them all at
home
BRANNIGAN

All right then wetll shoot it
like this

There is a CLICK and a bulb flashes in Charlies face

TIMECUT Rane steps out of the store and walks down the
sidewalk toward his Cadillac Wearing his new suit he
carries a box of his old clothes under one arm

He glances at his reflection in the store windows as
he passes He is not pleased with what he sees He
is still trying to get the knack of walking on high heels

Suddenly fed up with what he sees he stops and stares at
himself in a store window He tucks the box under his
left arm and walking toward the car pulls his floral
shirt right off his chest with his right hand At first
the shirt doesnt come He yanks and tugs and rips it
off in shreds

Walking more quickly toward his car Rane reaches down
and removes his shoes one by one tossing each one a
different direction as he goes He wears yellow-and-
brown argyle socks

He throws the box into the open back seat of the con-
vertible hops in starts the engine and squeals off

cur TO

WELCOME HERO

Rane brakes his Caddy into the dusty shoulder in front
of his house

He gets out of the car and walks toward the house in his
argyle stocking feet Under his brown velvet suitcoat
are the shredded remnants of a Cardin shirt and under
that a sleeveless undershirt

He notices a brown Ford station wagon (the kind with
fake wood on the side) in the driveway as he walks past
but pays it no mind Three of the license plate numbers
are RFD

Rane opens the door and walks into the house

As Rane steps into the LIVING ROOM he feels the presence
of someone behind him The steel blue barrel of a 38
revolver is raised to the back of his head

A raspy Mexican voice says firmly

MEXICAN VOICE
Welcome home hero Sit down

Rane walks slowly across the room and sits on the sofa
underneath the Memory Wall To his right is the new
color TV some of the presents atop it have been opened
Among the presents we notice some cologne and of all
things -- Barry Sadlers 1969 Green Berets album

Rane surveys the room A fortyish MEXICAN in a Robert
Hall suit stands before him with a 38 in his hand Two
young Texas thugs stand against the far wall They wear
cowboy boots faded jeans western shirts Stetsons and
shit-eating grins They also carry revolvers

The door to Marks bedroom is ajar Janet and Mark
frightened sit on the edge of the bed watching someone
out of Ranes view

MEXICAN
We hear you got some money hid
hero Wed like to have it

Rane says nothing

MEXICAN
You might as well talk up now
hero cause youre going to talk
sooner or later and I can guarantee
sooner is going to be a lot
preferable to later

Rane opens his mouth words come out He speaks in an
empty monotone

RANE
That money is all I got to show
for seven years I will never

give it up

MEXICAN
You will give it up gringo You
know that

CAMERA CLOSES IN on Rane he says nothing

The Mexican motions to the two thugs He speaks in a
tired professional tone of voice

MEXICAN
All right T-Bird bust heem

Pegale

T-BIRD the first Texan walks over to Rane and clips
him across the chin with the barrel of his gun Blood
appears on Charlies lower cheek T-Bird aims his re-
volver point blank at Ranes left eye

The SECOND TEXAN a hulking young man walks around the
other side of Rane and puts a knife to his throat A
drop of blood trickles down his neck

MEXICAN
Te duele hero
pauses)

Look I dont want to fool around
Im as patriotic as the next guy
but if you dont tell us where
that 124 Gs is hid you are going
to be dead very soon

Janets SOBS can be heard from the bedroom

CAMREA CLOSES IN on Rane again and all of a sudden we
realize how he survived seven years of torture

It is as if Charles Rane has removed his mind from his
body It doesnt matter what anybody does to his body
because he is no longer in it These men are torturing
an empty body

Ranes awkwardness and uneasiness are suddenly gone His
face is blank calm distant he is now in a world he
totally understands He is more experienced at being
tortured than his torturers are at torturing

He really doesnt have the choice whether to tell them
where the money is hidden or not He could not tell if
he wanted to He has lost his capacity to give in

As the Mexicans boots step toward Rane we notice they
are made from multi-colored suede patches

The Texans step aside as the Mexican pulls a gold butane
lighter from his pocket Igniting it the Mexican runs
the lighter up and down Charlies cheek Even though

he is not tied or held down Rane does not resist

MEXICAN
Come on hero comeon Where de
mangos hid hey

The Mexican pulls his lighter away from Ranes blistered
cheek

T-BIRD
Man that usually does it

SECOND TEXAN
Sheeit that old boy is a tough un
(chortles)

The Second Texan is obviously a low grade intelligence
The Mexican looks at hima moment

Thinking the Mexican pulls out a cigarette and lights

it with his lighter Suddenly -- angry and exasperated «
the Mexican chucks down his cigarette and lighter and
grabs Rane by his brown velvet lapels

MEXICAN
Cabron I can make this damn

Fexican talk

The Mexican hauls Charlie into the KITCHEN and the
Texans follow

Passing in front of the grease-spattered map of Viet Nam
the Mexican grabs Charlie by the left wrist and leads

him over to the sink He turns on the faucet then flips
the switch we hear the familiar grinding sound

Holding Charlies hand above the disposal the Mexican
yells

MEXICAN
Talk now hero

Rane says nothing

The Mexican thrusts Charlies hand into the disposal
We hear a hideous grinding sound Ranes face is
blitzed with pain

MEXICAN
Cabron gringo Me cago en la
eche de tu puta madre Maricon
Concha Bizocho

The Mexican pulls Ranes hand out of the disposal and
examines it (we do not see the hand)

T-BIRD
(with admiration)
Es un tio barbaro

MEXICAN
(to Rane)
Talk

Rane says nothing The Mexican rethrusts Charlies hand
into the disposal

This time the Mexican does not remove it so quickly We
here the GRINDING of flesh and bones as we watch Ranes
agonized stoic face His body cries out for him to
break down but he cannot

When the Mexican finally does remove Ranes hand and
switch off the disposal we see (although only fleetingly)
that the fingers have been ground aWwaye

The Mexican walks back toward the living room T-Bird
follows The Second Texan grabs a kitchen towel and
wraps up the bloody mess under Ranets left cuff

T-BIRD
I dont think wetre going to get
it jefe

MEXICAN
Maybe not But we got one more
chance

As they enter the LIVING ROOM the Mexican calls into
Marks bedroom

MEXICAN
Melio Traigame son esposo
The Second Texan brings Charlie back into the living room

and sets him down on the sofa Rane looks up at the
Mexican

MELIO a young Mexican hood wearing tight green pants
brings Janet in from the bedroom Janet tries to scream
when she sees Charlie but the only thing that comes from
her mouth is a pathetic croaking sound

The Mexican gestures and Melio forces Janet to her knees
in front of Charlie Melio puts his small 32 automatic
to her temples

MEXICAN
Mano in another time and place I
would be proud to know you because
you are so macho But now I
am going to have to kill your wife
if you do not tell me where that
money is hid right away You know
I am telling the truth Your wife
is very close to death

CAMERA CLOSES IN on Ranets face there is no emotion

CAMERA stays on Ranes face as we hear three voice tracks
simultaneously One voice is Janets another the Mexi
cans and the third - and dominant - is Charlies own
narrative VOICE OVER It is an excerpt from something

he has told Maxwell a reminiscence from Hanoi

JANET 0S RANE V0 MEXICAN 0OS
Tell them They would walk into my Do that hero
Charlie Oh cell two of them the one ‘Tell them
please please we called O11 Can Harry and You got 15
please tell Ap Chong his assistant seconds left
them Its They would say Today is Comeon talk
not worth it the day you die Lt Rane Ten seconds
Oh Charlie and put a gun to my head Talk Five
tell them and pull the trigger seconds

And the gun would be empty Talk hero
But you were always afraid

because sometimes they did

it to prisoners and the gun

wouldnt be emptyeee

All these voices abrupt HALT when we hear the sharp sound
of a 32 automatic discharging BAAM There is an
ABBREVIATED SCREAM a SILENCE and the THUD of a body
slumping to the floor

Ranets face is as calm and placid as the distant sea

We hear Marks SCREAMING VOICE and CAMERA CUTS to him
running from the bedroom

MARK
I know where the moneys hid I
know where Its in the barn
Out back Under the tools I
saw him hide it

Even this draws no emotion from Rane

MEXICAN
(softly)
Menos mal Show him where kid

Go one

The Second Texan leads Mark out back

TIMECUT The Mexican and his assistants look at the
money briefly as the Second Texan opens the sack on the
chair Rane sits unmoving Janets body at his feet
Mark in shock sits nearby Charlie looks over at his
money

T-BIRD
Vamos a guitaros de aqui

SECOND TEXAN
Yoah-ah Still the same plan

MEXICAN
You and T-Bird take the wagon and
well meet at Big Eds in Acuna

The Mexican stoops beside Janets body to pick up his
gold butane lighter

Melio packs up the money and starts out the front door
T-Bird gestures toward Mark and Rane

T-BIRD
What about them

MEXICAN
Well have to stop them of course
Theres no stopping now
(looks at Rane)
Yeah Kill the poor son of a bitch

T-Bird raises his revolver arms length and shoots Mark
in the head Turning half-circle he aims his revolver
and shoots Rane in the head

Charlie falls off the sofa and slumps to the floor

MEXICAN
(softly)

Chupate esa
SCREEN GOES TO BLACK

SEVERAL DAYS LATER The screen slowly comes into FOCUS
We see a NURSEs face

The Nurses eyes open with excitement She calls out

NURSE
Doctor Doctor Come quickly
Hes coming tol

There is the SOUND of FOOTSTEPS and the faces of two
DOCTORS come into view Behind them stands Col Maxwell
One doctor bends toward us

CUT to third person POV The doctors bend over Ranes
bed Col Maxwell watches them

Charlies head face and left hand are heavily bandaged
His eyes are blurry his face pale

Maxwell leans over to Charlie putting his hand on the
edge of the bed

MAXWELL
Charlie can you hear me Can you
hear me

The doctor looks sharply at Maxwell but Maxwells return
glance indicates he feels he must continue

MAXWELL
Can you hear me Charlie This is
very important Can you tell us
‘anything Who were they

With great effort Rane shakes his head no and sinks
back to the pillow

The screen goes OUT OF FOCUS and slowly to BLACK

MEMORY FAILS

FADE IN several days later Ranets HOSPITAL ROOM

Charlies bed has been cranked up a bit and he has his
eyes open

Around his bed stand Maxwell an FBI INVESTIGATOR and
the Nurse The walls of Charlies large private room
are lined with floral wreaths and bouquets One bears
the legend GET WELL SOON LT COL RANE

Col Maxwell bends toward Charlie while the Nurse looks
admiringly on

MAXWELL
(reassuring)
Youtre going to be all right
Charlie The doctors say
everythings going to be
all right

Rane smiles weakly
A newspaper on Ranes bedstand proclaims RANE TO RECOVER

MAXWELL

I guess I should have known all
along Nothing could ever stop
you

(pause)
I hate to go through this again
but we have to

(gesturing)
This is Special Investigator Tom
Festerhof from the FBI Hes here
to help us

Festerhof draws near the bed

FESTERHOF

If theres anything anything at
all you might remember No matter
how insignificant It might help
use Its been almost a week and the
trail is getting colder every day
We have so little to go on

(a beat no response)
The entire combined forces of the
United States Air Force the FBI
the Texas Rangers the Texas State
Police and the Corpus Christi Police

we need is a little more information
to swing into action
Rane draws himself up in his bed a little

Festerhof

RANE

thing I remember I was coming home

The Director has put top priority
on this case as has the President
himself We have instructions
to apprehend these murderers at
all costs Weve been instructed

Most Wanted list once we discover
who they are

MAXWELL
Youtve got to keep trying to
remember Something has to come

FESTERHOF
Do you remember the hand
(holds up left hand)

RANE

(growing impatient)
No I dont remember that either

(gestures toward

head)
I was in the car I walked toward
the house then I woke up here

MAXWELL
(reassuring)
All right Charlie its all right

RANE

SCREEN GOES TO BLACK

CUT TO

THIS TOO WILL PASS

FADE IN several days later Charlie is sitting up in
bed His facial bandages have been removed (burn scars
remain) and his head bandage is considerably smaller

On his lap rests a stack of old newspapers Rane is
going through them reading press accounts of the murders
and his recovery The latest paper shows a picture of
him sitting up in his bed smiling and waving

Cliff wearing his policemans uniform walks into the
room Rane looks up

RANE
(smiling)
Hey Cliff
CLIFF

How are you Charlie

Cliff grasps Ranes good hand with both hands and shakes
it firmly

RANE
Great Cliff Getting better
Rane points to the newspaper photo

RANE
Theyre making me quite a star

Cliff is a little surprised by Charlies up mood but
doesnt say anything For his part Cliff is very down
almost distraught

Cliff sees a steel artificial hand lying on the bedstand

CLIFF
I see they got you a new hand

RANE
(picks it up)
Yeah Pretty snazzy huh It
hurts a little to wear it at first
so Im just sort of getting used to
having it around

Charlie slips the artificial hand with its twin staine
less steel hooks onto his left hand to show Cliff how it
will look

CLIFF
Youtll get the knack of it all
right

Rane puts the artificial hand back on the bedstand

CLIFF
I got some good news for you
Charlie Some of the Corpus
businessmen are getting together
and want to partially reimburse
you for your losses you know
in the robbery

RANE
No No Thank them but tell
them I dont want no more charity
Janet had some life insurance and
I got that money coming and I can
get along on that I dont need
anything else

CLIFF
(morbid)
Well if thats the way you want
it

There is an awkward pause finally Cliff lets out a
deep sigh

CLIFF
Oh God Charlie life is lonely
without her

Cliff swallows his tears

CLIFF
She was some kind of woman wasnt
she Charlie I dontt know how
Im going to get along without
her

Cliff brushes back his tears and sniffs Charlie reaches
out and puts his hand on Cliffs shoulder Cliff sinks
his head into Charlies chest

CLIFF
(crying)
We gotta get them bastards We
gotta get ‘em Oh Janet

Rane comforts him
KO

RANE
Hang together Cliff Youtll be

THE VOICE OF EXPERIENCE

FADE IN Rane walks down the hospital corridor with
Col Maxwell Rane is wearing hospital pajamas and a
bathrobe -- and his new stainless steel hand

Several nurses watch adoringly as he passes

MAXWELL
You all ready to go home Charlie

RANE
Yep Im looking forward to getting
out of here tomorrow

MAXWELL
It may be kind of hectic

RANE
Dont worry I can handle it

Rane holds up his artificial hand opens the claws

RANE
Got a cigarette

MAXWELL
Youre really getting good with
that thing

Maxwell shakes out a cigarette and Charlie picks it up
with his artificial hand Rane places the cigarette in
his mouth and Maxwell lights it for him

RANE
Yep Just like a regular hand now
I can hold a newspaper put on a
shirt -- even tie my shoes

MAXWELL
Youve had plenty of time the last
couple weeks to think things over
Has anything come back to you
Even the slightest detail A
color a shape The police are
stymied They need something to
go on

RANE
No Bill Its all gone for good
The dizziness went away but the
memory never came back Ili
never remember anything I think
its better that way
MAXWELL
Yeah maybe it is
(a beat)
Honestly Charlie I think you
can cope with these things better
than I can

A RASPING SOUND
FADE IN Late that night It is about 2 am in the
dark hospital
The CAMERA slowly DOLLIES down the darkened corridor
In the distance we hear a RASPING SOUND krerww krerwwe
The silent TRACKING SHOT continues We pass stationary
hospital carts closed doors a night nurse silently
working
The RASPING SOUND grows louder Krerww kKrerww

We TRACK around a corner in the corridor and approach
the partially open door to Ranes room We track in

The RASPING SOUND is now louder KRErww KREerww
We TRACK across the room toward Ranes bed

A small night light shines about Charlies bed Rane
is sitting up working on something in his lap

We TRACK closer KRERWW KRERWW

The CAMERA CLOSES IN on Ranes work he is slowly sharp-
ening the hook of his artificial hand with a long metal
file With each long stroke the claws become sharper
CUT TO his face it is hard and determined

We suddenly realize Rane has never forgotten his night
of torture He knows what he must do

KRERWW KRERWW

D DAY

Approximately 830 am Charles Rane neatly dressed in
a conservative suit walks briskly down the hospital cor-
ridor with Col Maxwell There is considerable excitement
up and down the corridors Rane is being released

Several nurses and hospital personnel smile wave or shake
hands with the passing war hero Charlie is also smiling
nodding goodbye

Approaching the front door Rane and Maxwell brace them-
selves OUTSIDE they are greeted by a cluster of
pushing-shoving newsmen and photographers

MAXWELL
(calling out)
All right men You know the agreement
Only photographs No questions

Rane poses for photographers and the cameras click away
After a moment Maxwell thanks the newsmen and leads
Rane to an awaiting Air Force car

MAXWELL
(to photographers)
Tomorrow men

TIMECUT Rane and Maxwell ride in the back seat of the AF
car A serviceman acts as chauffeur Rane looks ahead
with concern

RANE
(to Maxwell)
Where are we going

MAXWELL
I thought youd want to stop at
the cemetery a moment

RANE
Well not just yet I want to
come home and rest first Just
for a little while

MAXWELL
You want me to stop over for a
while

RANE

No I want to be alone Im sick
of crowds Ill see you again
tomorrow
4S

MAXWELL
Well okay
(to driver)
Go to Lt Col Ranes home

TIMECUT The AF car pulls up in front of Ranes home and
Charlie gets out

Maxwell gets out to follow Rane but Rane waves him off
The AF chauffeur also gets out but Rane waves him back
also Charlie walks toward the front door

Maxwell and the chauffeur look at each other shrug and
get back into the car

Once inside the INT LIVING ROOM Rane peeks through the
front curtain to see if Maxwell has left yet After a
moment the AF car drives away

Rane turns and walks directly through the living room
The room has been straightened and cleaned there is a
new carpet but Rane doesnt even pause long enough to
notice

Entering his CELLARWORKSHOP Rane walks directly to his
gun rack He starts pulling guns out of the rack and
Placing them on a work table

It is an impressive collection 2 nickel-plated Colt
Commander 45 automatics a Smith and Wesson 357 Combat
Magnum a snub-nosed Colt Cobra 22 revolver a Winchester
12 gauge Super 6-shot pump shotgun 2 Browning B-SS 12
gauge Double Barrel shotguns plus clips and boxes and
boxes of ammunition

With his good hand Rane clamps the Winchester 6-shot
into his workbench vice and proceeds to saw off the
barrel The barrel CLANGS to the cement floor CU
lying on the floor the sawed-off barrel looks like the
leavings of a major amputation

Rane starts carrying his guns into the LIVING ROOM

TIMECUT soon they are all spread on the sofa

Going into his BEDROOM Charlie removes his suit coat
and shirt He removes his freshly pressed blue AF
uniform out of the closet on a hanger and places it on
the bed

Rane removes the medals from the uniform and places them
on the bed beside it
46

TIMECUT Rane wearing his uniform finishes loading the
last of his guns into the roomy trunk of the big red
Cadillac CU the guns lie in neat rows on an old
blanket Rane removes a 45 and closes the trunk Plac-
ing the 45 under the front seat he walks back toward
the house

In the KITCHEN Rane rummages about for some food but can
only find a package of stale OREOs He picks up the pack-
age and a quart of JandB and walks back toward the living
room

In the BEDROOM he removes a stack of twenty dollar bills
which had been hidden under the dresser There appears
to be about 500

When he slips the wad of bills into his pants pocket
Charlie feels something unusual there Fishing around
in his pocket he comes out with a piece of paper It
reads

Linda Forchet TR6-3265

He looks at the paper a moment and walks back toward the
living room As he passes the bed we notice the medals
are no longer lying on it

By the time he gets in the LIVING ROOM he has his mind
made up He sits down and dials the phone He waits
for the phone to ring It does and a girls pleasant
Texas VOICE comes on the other end

LINDA (0S)
Hello JK Vending Machines

Ranes long red Caddy (top down) pulls up beside the
EAT-RITE COFFEE SHOP He HONKS the horn and waves inside

Linda Forchet comes bundling out an overnight bag in her
hand She is wearing a short pleated purple skirt a
grab-me yellow pullover and mounds of enticingly
coiffured blonde hair

Linda is everything Tammy Wynette sings about ex
cheerleader ex-wife 9-to-5 community chest Shes
about 95 plastic but the 5 that aint gives her an
edge on just about everybody else

LINDA
Hello Lt Colonel Some car you
got

RANE

Welcome aboard Linda

Ranes Cadillac works its way through the late morning
traffic Ever since his accident Charlie Ranes
personality has taken a marked turn for the better He
seems more at ease genial confident That uncertainty
and unnamed fear are gone - or perhaps they have

simply been driven underground replaced by a deeper
motivation which allows him to appear calm on the surface

LINDA
I pretended I got sick I said
I had cramps Here you know
(hold lower abdomen)
Woman-type sick That always works

There is no immediate response from Rane so Linda picks
up the thin conversational thread again

LINDA
You dont give a person much time
(a beat)
Where we going again
RANE
Going to tcuna You ever been
there
LINDA

Thats a greaseball town right
Over the line

RANE
Yeah Down from Del Rio
LINDA
Whats there
RANE

Action Some guys I used to know

The car radio has been playing softly but Lindas ear
catches a song she likes

LINDA
Oh Tammy Wy-nette

Linda turns up the radio

Rane drives up the ramp to the expressway Putting his
hand on Lindas bare knee he says

RANE
Now watch this baby go

Charlie trounces on the accelerator in a great arrogant
burst of exhaust the huge red convertible fishtails
down the highway

The radio plays as they speed west
Just follow the stairway
To this lonely world of mine
Youll find me waiting here
In apartment number nine

MANLY ARROGANCE

Somewhere west of Carrizo Springs Rane pulls off Highway
83 and drives into an EAT GAS truckstop

A young Texan station attendant looks on with awe as Rane
wheels the Caddy next to one of the pumps

RANE
(getting out)
Fillerup Ethyl Supreme Oil
n water

Linda hops out and follows Charlie as he heads toward the
restaurant Her hair is pathetically windblown and she
gropes for the hairbrush in her purse as she walks

LINDA
Jesus Charlie we was going so
fast the words blown right outa
my mouth

They catch the stares of several truckers as they enter
the INT TRUCKSTOP Feeling their stares Rane cups
Lindas left ham in a display of manly arrogance Em-
barrassed Linda removes his hand from her ass

Rane slides into a vinyl booth and Linda plops down
across from him They appear on very amiable terms

Rane slides the menu toward him but doesnt look at it
Linda vainly tries to brush her windblown hair

LINDA
Gee I never thought youd remember
who I was

RANE
Oh I dont forget Linda

Linda a little embarrassed tries to excuse herself
for picking up Rane

LINDA
Golly Im just such a fool for
Army men Just show me anything
in a uniform and I get all wet
(laughs at herself)
I should be kept on a leash around
Army bases

RANE
You from Army people

LINDA
Yeah I was an Army brat Dad
was stationed at the Naval Air
Station in Beeville Then he
got promoted and we moved to
Corpus He always said I shoulda
stayed Army He was real upset
when I married Sam

RANE
Why
LINDA
‘Cause Sam was intellectual and
all
RANE
(Ainterrupting)

No why did you marry Sam

LINDA
Well he just knew everything
He was real smart not like me
Im about as bright as a night-
light Hed made a gob of money
in real estate and was handsome
The marriage wasnt his idea I
hit on him But then he started
getting into politics and dropped
me like a hot potater Hes an
aide to something or other now in
Austin I read his name once in
the paper Sometimes his mother
calls - she always liked me

RANE

LINDA

LINDA

The waitress walks over

Rane replies without ever taking his eyes off Linda
Linda smiles apologetically at the waitress

RANE
Two cheeseburgs fries and chocolate
malts

LINDA

The waitress takes the order and leaves Looking at the
jukebox selector in the booth Linda searches for a coin
in her purse Rane pulls out a quarter and gives it to

her

LINDA

Linda puts the quarter into the box

LINDA
Damn This is one of those new
machines they got now Only two
plays for a quarter Thats a

Linda pushes two selections and turns back to Charlie

LINDA

A young child about 8 walks by the booth and spots
Charlies shiny stainless steel hand He stops and
stares at it

His mother calls reprimandingly from a nearby booth

MOTHER

Rane replies to the mother

RANE

The little boy connects Ranes uniform with his artificial
hand

Rane reaches in his back pocket and pulls out one of his
medals He hands it to Billy

BILLY
Wow Kin I keep it
RANE

of them
BILLY

Gee thanks

Billy walks away admiring his new present
RANE

‘Bye Billy

Billy walks off

Rane looks back at Linda

coming down her cheeks He holds her hand

RANE

Tears are

Oh baby Come on Pull yourself
together Your malts coming

cUT TO
BAIT IN THE TRAP

The big red Cad hauls ass down US 277 100 mph maybe
more The SOUNDTRACK plays on

You better move your feet
If you don’t want to eat
A meal thats called Fist City

TIMECUT Rane and Linda pull into the Del Rio city
limits Population 10000

Crossing through the town they drive south toward the
border

Rane pulls off the road and drives into the lot of the
NO-TELL MOTEL It is about 400 pm

Linda straightening her hair -- now a hopeless task
watches Charlie as he checks in comes out with a key
and walks into a nearby room

Linda picks up her overnight bag and follows

INSIDE the MOTEL ROOM Rane walks into the bathroom and
washes his face and hands Linda sets her bag down and
flops onto the bed The walls of the room are pink

the tufted bedspread purple and a print of a bulifighter
decorates one wail

Linda watches Charlie soulfully “Her man strips to the
waist and washes his sinewy trunk with a damp washcloth
and redresses

Linda pulls up her thin yellow ribbed pullover just below
her breasts revealing a deliciously tanned band of skin
Kicking off her shoes she sensuously sets her heels
against the purple bedspread

Leaving the bathroom in a mess Charlie walks back into
the room and eyes Linda Rane hack-coughs he is not
well
Seeing the messy bathroom Linda says playfully
LINDA
Dont you ever clean up behind
yourself
RANE
Thats why God made Mexicans

Smiling apologetically Rane turns and walks toward the
door he has priorities higher than sex

Rane opens the door and walks outside Linda shocked
jumps up and runs after him

OUTSIDE she finds him resting against the Caddy waiting
for her

LINDA
Hey whatcha doing Dont you want
me to come along

RANE
Of course I do I was just
waiting for you

LINDA
Where are you going
RANE

LINDA

RANE

LINDA

RANE

LINDA

RANE

My God Ohno Not this You

RANE

LINDA

RANE

LINDA

RANE
(sincere )

LINDA

RANE
There are worse things
(pause)
Linda this means little to you
but it means everything to me
(a beat)
Will you come

LINDA
Well I aint got much choice
do I

CUT TO

THE INSIDE MAN

Charlie and Linda pass through Customs pay the 20¢ toll
and cross the border into Acuna

They pass through the business district of Acuna - a
pretty sorry-looking place - and head south The
peasants look up in wonder as the giant car passes

They pass through the proper business district of
Acuna and reach a large vacant weed-infested bottle-
strewn field Rane thumpety-thumps the Cadillac across
the field The field is kept unkempt to separate the
town proper from the Boys Town -- and with good reason

The Acuna Boys Town (because thats where the boys go)
is about the seediest of all the seedy border towns
stretching from Tijuana to Neuvo Laredo Most of the
other border towns halted their forward progress in
about 1935 Acuna however is suspended in 1890

Rows of tacky bars and brothels are banked up from the
gutted one-lane white dust streets There are few
electric lights and horses and carriages amble down the
narrow street The bars have names like El Lobo

“El Coyote El Caballo

Rane drives his big convertible down the middle of the
narrow street forcing the horses and carriages to the
side as he goes It is an arrogant breach of convention
Border lowlife look down at Rane and Linda from the

high curb embankments

Rane finds an opening between two buildings and pulls the
car into it He cuts the engine

Looking down the row of seedy bars his eyes light on a
painted sign reading La Mujer Negro He motions to it

RANE
Thats a good starting place Go
over there Ask for a guy named
Big Ed Say youve been sent to
see him

LINDA
Whatja mean go in there Thats
greaseballville in there No
decent person would go in there

RANE
Nothing can happen to you Its
broad daylight

LINDA
I was willing to do something
for you Charlie but not this
Lets go back This is painful
Humiliating

Rane starts to run out of patience Theres no way of
course hes going to go back Instead of getting angry
at Linda however he speaks with passion

RANE

Linda Ill make this short but
its important There is something
you have to understand These
things are not important Honest
All these external things like
pain humiliation sorrow pleasure
fame happiness love sex glory
emotions they are nice but they
are not important You can live
without them They exist on the
outside they are not real The
only thing real is the inside the
interior life and that has nothing
to do with the outside The life
that comes from within here

(holds heart)
ee» and here

(holds head)
« these are the real things
That is where you live Nothing
else matters Im telling you the
truth now You may have not heard
it before but its the truth
nonetheless Once you live inside
those things dont matter

(a beat)
Honest Linda believe me

It is a deranged speech -- but persuasive Linda is
nearly mesmerized

LINDA
Youre crazy Charlie As crazy
as a jaybird in the snow

RANE
Will you go
(a beat)
For me
LINDA

I dont suppose anything can
happen Poor Linda Here she
goes again

RANE
Will you

LINDA
Yes For you Charlie for you

She embraces him and they kiss She is still embracing
him as he reaches under the seat and pulls out his
nickel-plated 45 automatic He slips it into his shirt

RANE
All right lets go

CUT TO
64

TIO TACO

Thrusting all her WASP sexuality before her Linda struts
into the dingy bar The snuff queen comes home

Every eye turns to greet her There are several exclam
ations of Vaya Mujer (What a woman)

A young unattractive half-naked white girl is dancing
to the Spanish RandB jukebox A couple lackadaisical
Mexican hookers work the bar

Linda walks up to the FIRST BARTENDER

LINDA
Im looking for Big Ed I was
sent here for him Do you know
him

1ST BARTENDER

No entiendo No Ingles Que se
YO

A SECOND BARTENDER walks up

2ND BARTENDER
Big Ed Dont know nobody by that
name
(calling out)

Hay alguien que sabe Big Ed
No one answers Finally a DRUNKEN MEXICAN calls out

DRUNKEN MEXICAN
Big Ed

2ND BARTENDER
Si Big Ed

DRUNKEN MEXICAN
I know Big Ed Big Eds a friend
of mine

2ND BARTENDER
Well this lady is a friend of his

The Drunken Mexican walks over to Linda

DRUNKEN MEXICAN
I know Big Ed Follow me

He gestures for her to follow him to the back of the
bar She does

As they pass he sees a little local Acuna color three
drunken Mexicans sit in a booth with an old car battery
-on the table They take turns holding the live wires
attached to the battery each seeing who can hold on
the longest Each effort calls for more laughs and
more beers

The Drunken Mexican leads Linda into a small PRIVATE ROOM
at the rear of the bar

Its pretty clear by now that our Mexican friend isnt
going to tell Linda about Big Ed until she provides him
with certain obvious favors -- and even then its
doubtful Linda seems uncomfortable

DRUNKEN MEXICAN
Why do you want to see Big Ed
Hes my friend

LINDA
Im gonna be his girl I was
sent here

DRUNKEN MEXICAN
Good Big Ed likes beautiful

gringo girls

CUT Charles Rane strolls into the INT BAR looking for
Linda Unable to find her he seems upset His artie
ficial hand is artfully tucked into his pants pocket

He walks to the rear of the bar where he overhears the
voices of Linda and the Drunken Mexican

CUT INT PRIVATE ROOM

DRUNKEN MEXICAN
(cocky)
Im Big Eds friend He likes
people who do things for me
(a beat)
Do something for me and I will
tell you where to find him

LINDA
(uneasy)
What

DRUNKEN MEXICAN
You know this
(points to crotch)

LINDA
Big Ed wouldnt like that

DRUNKEN MEXICAN
Oh si he would very much
(a beat)
Besides you have no choice puta

LINDA
I can leave

DRUNKEN MEXICAN
You will not leave bitch

The Mexican puts his hand up to Lindas cheek

The door opens Charles Rane tall in his sky-blue
AF uniform walks in

The Mexican looks at his partially hidden hook

DRUNKEN MEXICAN
You look like you could use a hand
gringo
(laughs)

RANE
(to Linda)
You did real fine Linda Now
wait for me in the car

DRUNKEN MEXICAN
She goes nowhere Yankee

RANE
Go on Linda You did real good

Linda gets up and Charlie takes her seat The Drunken
Mexican gets up to follow her

RANE
No se para

The above is a Latin American pun meaning both Dont
stand up and Dont get an erection

The Mexican chuckles and sits down Rane sits down and
puts on a phony polite smile

RANE
Now spic youre going to tell
me where Big Ed is

DRUNKEN MEXICAN
I tell you nothing maricon

You tell now

DRUNKEN MEXICAN
Screw

The Drunken Mexican gets up from his chair dragging
his right hand across the table as he goes

Rane suddenly whips his sharpened left hook from under
neath the table and sinks it into the back of the Mex-
icans right hand locking it to the table top The
Mexican YELPS

With his right hand Charlie pulls the 45 from his
waist and aims it point blank at the Mexicans face

RANE
Now tio taco youre going to
tell me where Big Ed is or Im
going to spread your brains
against the wall

DRUNKEN MEXICAN
I dont know no Big Ed

Standing up Rane presses the 45 against the Mexicans
forehead forcing him to his knees

RANE
Dont mess with me taco-face
I could make a stone talk

DRUNKEN MEXICAN
(erying)
Dont know Dont know

RANE
Talk or die

Rane prepares to pull the trigger

DRUNKEN MEXICAN
Go to the El Lobo They know where
he is Ask Billy Sanchez the
bartender

RANE
Good

Rane removes the hook from the Mexicans hand and tucks
his 45 back into his shirt

The Mexican holding his bloody hand runs from the
room

Charlie wipes his bloody hook against his blue pants
and prepares to exit

Walking back into the INT BARROOM Rane sees the
patrons bartender and stripper staring at him in
silence Looking at the doorway he sees several Mexican
toughs waiting for him

Using his hook hand he pulls open his shirt to reveal
his shiny 45 There is a pause and the group breaks
up Rane strides through the bar and out the door

cuUT TO

JUST THE PRELIMINARY STUFF

Night is falling as Rane and Linda walk down the street
toward the El Lobo The streets having no electrical
lighting are dark and foreboding

As they approach the El Lobo Linda says

LINDA
Let me take care of this one my
way

RANE

Okay with me

The entrance to the El Lobo a classy () private
club-brothel can be seen at the end of a narrow alley

Rane pauses a moment letting Linda walk ahead of him

Several Mexicans check the guests as they enter the El
Lobo Linda simply struts through them Again vaya

mujer
INSIDE Linda walks up to the bar and sits down

The El Lobo is several notches up from the La Mujer
Negro -- or down depending on your viewpoint On stage
two naked teenage girls one white and one black close
dance with each other in front of a redneon-lighted
Spanish band And this is only the early show

The bar is dripping with hooker gangster and Texas
macho types Lindas up front sexuality fits right in

Linda calls the bartender over

LINDA
Is Billy Sanchez here

BARTENDER
Ahorita

The Bartender walks off and comes back with Billy
Sanchez an American

BILLY SANCHEZ
Yeah baby

LINDA
Im looking for Big Ed

BILLY SANCHEZ
Youre a real nice piece of
something honey babe

LINDA
Im Big Eds new gal I met him
up in Corpus He told me to meet
him here

BILLY SANCHEZ
Ah Eddie gets it all you know
Why cant I get some honey

Charlie Rane walks into the El Lobo surveying the scene
His eyes stop as they catch the dancing teenage couple

LINDA
You look pretty good to me Billy
S but Im already a day late for
Big Ed and if he dont find me
quick hes gonna get angry

Rane walks over to the bar and sits several patrons away
from Linda

BILLY SANCHEZ
Well he aint even here They

LINDA
Al1

BILLY SANCHEZ
Yeah the whole bunch

LINDA

BILLY SANCHEZ

BILLY SANCHEZ

BILLY SANCHEZ

LINDA

BILLY SANCHEZ
Hmm On Peacock Off Arroyo

LINDA

BILLY SANCHEZ
Why dont you stay and see the
show It gets pretty good later
This is just the preliminary stuff
Maybe thered be something youd
like here better than El Paso
Drinks on me

LINDA
(smiling)
Could be

Rane seems a little upset his disciple has learned her
lesson too well He walks over-to Linda and Billy He
threateningly raises his sharpened hook to Billys face
and says

RANE
El cigarillo

Sanchez replies

BILLY SANCHEZ
Sure

And gives him a cigarette Rane picks it up with his
hook and Billy lights it for him

All three turn and watch the show for a moment A PAT
NAKED MEXICAN man has stepped on stage and the two naked
teenage girls are bending down kissing his feet worke
ing up Microphone in hand the Fat Mexican sings as

he is being mock-seduced

His singing is sort of a south-of-theborder parody of
Screaming Jay Hawkins all yelps and chants

FAT MEXICAN
Yow ah Get it get it get

Cupe cupe cupe Eee-oww

The patrons cheer Rane watches closely

TIMECUT It is about 830 All is dark in the streets
of Acuna Boys Town
Rane and Linda get into the Cadillac Rane starts the
engine turns on the lights and pulls into the narrow
street
Proceeding slowly down the dark street Rane sees some
figures in the distance There is the glint of a gun
We see the partially-lit face of the Drunken Mexican
Rane says to Linda

RANE
Get down

Linda crouches behind the dashboard

Charlie raises the 45 fires two shots into the air and
trounces on the accelerator

Spitting white dust the giant car charges forward

A few shots harmlessly discharge at the Cadillac as it
speeds through the street

cuT TO

A PACK OF OREOS A QUART OF SCOTCH AND THOU

Rane and Linda pull into the motel gravel lot

Rane gets out of the car and walks into the motel room
Linda exhausted follows

INSIDE the MOTEL ROOM Linda drops her tired body into

an easy chair Charlie steps into the bathroom splashes
some cold water on his face and walks back into the bed-
room

He picks up Lindas overnight bag and proceeds toward
the door

LINDA
(astonished)
Where do you think youre going

RANE
El Paso

LINDA
Thats 450 miles Im pooped

RANE
You can sleep in the car

LINDA
In the car -- at 110 miles per hour

RANE

LINDA
(ironic)
The grand concession
(a beat)
What about food Im hungry

RANE
Theres food in the car

Linda stands up
LINDA

Sheeit Dont you ever sleep in
a bed

RANE
Well sleep when its all over
74

TIMECUT Ranes Cadillac (top up) cruises at high speed
through the night down Highway 90 A CandW station plays
softly on the radio

INT CAR Linda is all huddled up in a corner of the
back seat The half-opened pack of OREOs rests in her
lap She listlessly pulls out an OREO twists it in
half examines each half and munches on one of them

Charlie sits at the wheel tugging at the quart of JandB
as he drives

TIMECUT Later that night about 2 am Linda is
asleep in the back seat

Charlie takes another drink of JandB The bottle is half
empty Feeling sleepy he turns up the CAR RADIO

The vast desert countryside stretches into miles and
miles of dark nothingness Two lonely headlights flash
through the night

The radio plays Jeanne Pruit

Satin sheets to lie on
Satin pillows to cry on
Still Im not happy dont
you see
Big long Cadillac
Tailor-mades upon my back
Still I want you to set
- me free

Rane mumbles along with the song Big long Cadillac
I want you to set me free

The song FADES OUT but Rane keeps mumbling to himself
as if he wants to say something but cant verbalize it

There is a sudden explosion -- BLOWOUT - and the
Cadillac CAREENS madly to the right

Rane struggles frantically to maintain control of the
runaway car as it charges into the desert night

Linda bouncing about in the back seat SCREAMS In
the middle of this nightmare ride the car RADIO starts
up with a hillbilly song

The Caddy bounces across several low gullies and ridges
and Linda is tossed over the front seat into the dash-
board The open bottle of JandB smashes against the
dashboard beside her
75-

The Cadillac finally thumps to a rest hundreds of
yards from the highway The radio BLARES

Charlie turns down the incongruous radio and then re-
laxing his arms gives out a deep sigh He is shaking
with fear and exhilaration

Linda her face livid in the moonlight trembles out
of control She tries to speak but can only stammer
and cry

WEEPING she falls on Charlies shoulders

LINDA
Charlie Charlie

Charlie puts his trembling arms around her

RANE
Linda

They hold each other for a moment The radio plays
softly in the background

Their lips meet and they begin kissing passionately
Soon they are embracing petting

Ranes fear and adrenalin are transformed into sexual
current he becomes sexually aroused

Slipping his hand under Lindas pullover Charlie
begins to lift it up She helps him

Linda pulls her top over her head revealing her breasts
She leans back across the broad red leather of the Cad
illac front seat

On the verge of sex still shaking from her brush with
death Linda begins to talk uncontrollably It is as

if there had been a torrent of words and feelings damned
up by her brain and that dam had suddenly burst

LINDA
I dont know why I throwed myself
on you like that I was just sitting
there listening to all you went
through and I started getting excited
and I could hardly stand it I had
never done anything like that before
except once and that was at a rodeo
but normally I never would cause
Im not like that and I got so
embarrassed when they took the
pictures what am I doing here

Rane puts his hand on her mouth

RANE
Ssh

He removes his hand and slowly hoists himself on top
of her She lets out a SIGH -- and so does he

LINDA
Oh Charlie youre some kind of
man Some kind of man

FADE OUT
TT

SOLILOQUY
FADE IN

As the CAMERA slowly FADES IN we discover it is not the
next morning as we expected but LATER THAT NIGHT

CAMERA OPENS on clear Texas night sky Tens of thousands
of stars are aligned in numerous configurations and con
stellations

Moving slowly across the sky the CAMERA studies the
heavens So do we

As we study the moving patterns of stars we hear the
dry monotoned VOICE of Charles Rane remembering a past
experience

RANE (V0)
It was sometime in 1968 Spring
Those who came after 1969 will
never know what it was like then
The V had me stretched out face-up
over a chunk of concrete My hands
and feet were tied to the floor
the concrete was under my backbone
The blood had stopped flowing to
my head so long before I couldnt
remember how many days Id been
there My tongue and brain had
dried out like old cork Though
I wasnt a believer I asked God
to come and take me then I
figurd it was the least He could
do Then Charlie that night He
did He reached into my body and
took out my soul It came out
like a long sliver being slowly
pulled from my heart Nothing
had ever felt so good before
and after that it never hurt as
much again

LINDA (0S)
(interrupting)
Charlie

Rane who had been lying back against the front seat
staring at the heavens turns and looks at Linda cuddled
up beside hin

RANE
Yes

LINDA
Whatcha doing

RANE
Thinking

LINDA
Oh

She cuddles up beside him and goes back to sleep
FADE TO

MUTANT MUSEUM

DAWN BREAKS over the desert Far off the highway
Ranes dusty red Cadillac sits stranded amid the sand
and tumbleweeds

INT CAR Linda her pullover spread across her breasts
feels a JOLT and wakes up

She looks out the back window and sees Charlie jacking
up the car The trunk door is closed

Dressing quickly Linda gets out and walks around back

LINDA
‘Morning ugly

RANE
(smiles)
Same to you beautiful

She embraces his shoulders They exchange a short kiss

TIMECUT Rane pounds the hubcap on the new tire He
opens the trunk and hefts the old tire and jack into it
with his good hand

Linda stares in shock as she sees the row upon row of
guns carefully placed in the trunk Rane says nothing

TIMECUT The Cadillac (top down) speeds down US 90

TIMECUT Rane pulls into an ECONO-GAS station Linda
gets out and heads toward the Ladies Room Charlie
says something to the station attendant

Next to the Econo-Gas station stands FRED DOBBS MUTANT
MUSEUM It is a low ramshackle structure decorated with
hand-painted signs and pictures

The pictures painted against a red backdrop like a
carnival sideshow depict various animal mutants a
twoheaded calf Siamese twin sheep a one-eyed horse
and a five-legged dog Homemade sideshows of this sort
are not unusual in this part of Texas

Charlie meets Linda as she emerges from the Ladies Room
Throughout the last day Lindas immaculately conceived
Plastic snuff look has slowly been unraveling

Her hair hangs about her neck her pullover and skirt
are hopelessly wrinkled her makeup is faint and uneven
She grows more beautiful by the hour

Lindas demeanor indicates she wants to have a talk
with Rane They stand before Fred Dobbs colorful pan-

oply of mutants

LINDA

Ah Charlie Ive been thinking

About this trip and all

RANE
Yeah

LINDA

Dont you think its going a little
too far huh Shouldnt we be
going back to Corpus Theyre
bound to be wondering where you

RANE
I suppose they are

LINDA

Wont the doctors want to see you

RANE
I suppose they would
LINDA

I want to go back I should get

back Lets go

RANE
Okay
LINDA
(takes his arm)
Great

They start walking toward the car
Rane pulls out the wad of twenties

Reaching in his pocket
Pulling off several

hundred dollars he gives them to her

RANE

You can take a cab back with this

LINDA

No we were going to go back together

Rane nods his head silently No and holds out the money

for her

LINDA
It isnt right I shouldnt take
your money

RANE
Take it Linda I wont need it
where Im going

LINDA
Wont you come back with me

RANE
Its too late Im only pointed
in one direction now TI have no
choice

They look at each other and walk back toward the Cadillac
Rane hands Linda her overnight bag from the back seat and
pays the station attendant

They exchange a long kiss The station boy looks on

LINDA
I aint sorry I done this you know

Charlie looks pained He says nothing

LINDA
It was real though huh

RANE
Wasnt it

Rane climbs into the front seat and starts the engine
They glance at each other a moment each hoping the other
will relent Neither does

Rane slips the car into gear and pulls out of the station
Linda calls after him

LINDA
Charlie Charlie Wait for me

Charlie slams the Cadillac to a stop and backs to where
Linda is standing The station attendant stares in
amazement

Rane relieved smiles as Linda gets in He notices the
station attendant watching

RANE
Hey station boy Come here
82

The station boy walks over Rane digs a medal out of
his back pocket and gives it to the attendant

RANE
Here This is for you

The station boy examines the medal

STATION ATTENDANT
Wow A Purple Heart

RANE
(expansive )
Its a present from my lady friend
here

STATION ATTENDANT
(to Linda)
Thank you maam
Linda smiles and as she does
Rane tromps on the accelerator and the huge red Cadiliac
lurches forward in a burst of exhaust and spitting
gravel

A quarter mile down the highway one could still hear the
squealing tires

curt TO

FOREPLAY TO GUNPLAY

It is about 1100 am when Charlie and Linda drive their
Cadillac (top down) through the streets of El Paso

They both look worn and exhausted Charlies uniform
is soiled and wrinkled there are still bloodstains on
his left leg Linda is disheveled

They drive slowly through the bustling streets looking
about as if oddly surprised to find civilization still
exists

Rane spots a clean middle-class motel and pulls in

TIMECUT Charlie and Linda having checked in trudge
to thelr room Linda doesnt bother to bring her over
night bag

INSIDE the MOTEL ROOM Rane walks directly to the bath
room and begins freshening up He strips to the waist
Dampening a washcloth he begins to wash his upper torso
Lying on the king-size bed Linda watches Charlie silently

Looking into the mirror Rane runs his hand over his day-
old beard He turns back toward Linda

RANE
Did you bring your razor Linda
I forgot mine
She does not answer Charlie walks into the bedroom

RANE
Did you Bring a razor

Linda speaks softly but forcefully

LINDA
Where are you going Charlie

RANE

LINDA

Linda says nothing

LINDA

Charlie looks wistfully at his

84

Charlie sits on the bed and Linda runs her hand across
his tight stomach and chest

LINDA
You know you dont have to go at
all if you dont want to

He begins undressing her

RANE
How am I going to get any sleep
if you dont open the bed

Linda pulls off her top and opens the bed

LINDA
You always sleep with your shoes on

Charlie flops his feet on the bed

RANE
Only when Im too tired to take
them off

Charlie and Linda look at each other a moment

embrace

RANE
Oh darling

LINDA
I love you too Charlie

They

TIMECUT two hours later Linda naked sits up in
bed

Charlie dressed and shaved sits at the small writing
table In front of him is a spread-out map of El Paso
and three guns -- the two nickel-plated 45s and the
Browning Double Barrel

Rane inspects hefts and tests the guns He loads
them

Hearing Linda rustle in the bed he turns around and
smiles at her

LINDA
(pause)
I was serious about what I said
Charlie

RANE
What was that

LINDA
About not having to go You dont
have to you know

Rane says nothing He gathers up his map and guns

RANE
I know

Rane starts toward the door

RANE
If Im not back by morning get
out of town Catch a plane ride
the hound do what you need
Theres money in the drawer there
(gestures )

Linda looks at him a second then says playfully
LINDA
Roses are red
Violets are blue

A pies got a crust
And so do you

Charlie cant help but laugh He gives Linda an
abbreviated military salute

RANE
Catch you later

Charlie exits Close on Linda as her cheekbones drop

cur TO

STAKEOUT

Watching the street signs Rane pulls up to the corner of
Peacock and Arroyo and turns slowly down Peacock

It is an old wealthy section of town

Driving slowly down the street Rane examines the houses
on both sides of the street

In the rear of a large brick house Rane spots the brown
wood-paneled Ford station wagon The letters RFD
appear on the license plate

Rane parks his car at a safe distance and waits

After a while someone walks out onto the front porch
and walks back in T-Bird

Rane waits some more

He fishes around in the glove compartment comes out with
a brownbagged pint of JandB He pulls the paper back
unserews the cap and takes a hit

Then down the street comes a long white Lincoln Conti-
nental A large pair of steer horns is mounted on the
hood A young Mexican is driving In the back sits a
blg Texan dressed in a flashy lime green cowboy outfit
and next to him sits the Mexican in a new black suit
with a red tie

Rane slouches in the front seat and watches them pass
The Continental pulls up in front of the Wayne House
and HONKS its horn

After a moment several men come walking out of the
front door and step down the steps We recognize
T-Bird the Second Texan and Melio now wearing tight
orange pants

They all squeeze into the Continental We overhear a
few snatches of conversation

T-BIRD
Hot damndeddy We gonna have a
time Estupendo

SECOND TEXAN
Chiquita banana here I come
(chortiles)

The Mexican lights up a cigarette with his butane lighter

There is laughter as the Continental pulls away from
the curb

Rane turns his car around and follows them at a distance

Rane follows the Continental south through El Paso until
it reaches the Stanton Street Bridge Rane waits as the
Continental passes through customs after a perfunctory
look-through

Rane follows The BORDER GUARD waves him over

BORDER GUARD
Where you going soldier

RANE
Juarez

BORDER GUARD
How long will you be there

Rane tries to keep one eye on the vanishing Continental

RANE
A couple hours

BORDER GUARD
(handing him card)
This is a 24-hour entry permit

RANE
Thanks

Rane starts to pull away The Guard calls after him

BORDER GUARD
Hey wait

Rane stops the car The Border Guard walks up He looks
at Charlies artificial hand

BORDER GUARD
Arent you Charles Rane that POW

The Continental is completely gone from sight lost in
the maze of Mexican streets

(wary)
Yeah

BORDER GUARD
Youre real famous Ive been
reading all about you in the
paper

Rane shrugs

BORDER GUARD
Hey do you mind if I have my
picture taken with you My
wife talks about you all the
time

Charlie has now completely lost the trail of the Conti«
nental

RANE
(resigned)
Sure

The Border Guard goes back into the Customs Office and
re-emerges with a SECRETARY and a Brownie Starflex

The Border Guard poses beside the car as the Secretary
snaps the picture Just before the camera clicks Char-
lie lets out with his big beaming officious smile

BORDER GUARD
Hey thanks a lot

Rane reaches into his back pocket and pulls out another
medal He gives it to the Border Guard

RANE
Here this is a present

The Border Guard seems puzzled as he looks at the medal
Rane SQUEALS off

Rane now wanders through the side streets of Juarez He
has lost the trail The Continental is not to be found
anywhere

TIMECUT an hour later Rane driving down a side
street in the red light district sees the white Conti-
nental with the steer-horn hood ornament

He slows down and parks

One large stucco house seems to be the focus of all the
activity on the street Spanish MUSIC comes from within

He watches for a moment Melio walks out on the front
porch with a drink in his hand After a moment a
Mexican girl joins him and they sit on the old porch
sofa together They cuddle and share drinks from his
glass like a couple of high school sweethearts Very
touching

Rane looks down at the seat beside him There lying
against the red leather is a nickel-plated 45 automatic

TIMECUT Rane is still sitting in the front seat Melio
and the Mexican girl have gone in the house
Rane looks down at the 45 then up at the brothel

He thinks a moment tucks the gun under the front seat
starts up the engine and drives away

CUT TO

DREAMS OF BUNNIES

About 530 pm Rane pulls into the motel parking lot
The front seat of his Cadillac is stacked high with boxes
and packages

INSIDE the MCTEL ROOM Linda absentmindedly does her
fingernails on the bed as she waits Charlies return
She has let her hair down

She looks up anxiously as Charlie walks in Seeing him
she drops her fingernail file and rushes to his arms

LINDA
Charlie Youre all right
What happened

RANE
I didnt do it
LINDA
No
RANE

I changed my mind It wasnt
worth it I went to the store
instead

LINDA
Oh

RANE
It just hit me I was free and
didnt have to do anything So
I didnt
(a beat)
I bought you some things Let
me go get them

Charlie walks outside In a moment he returns piled
high with boxes and packages He sets them to the floor

LINDA
Wow Whats all that

RANE
(smiling)
Lotsa stuff I got a record player
One from Sears They said it was a
good one

Rane tries to rip open a cardboard box containing a
6995 portable stereo His hook is not too efficient
at this operation so Linda drops to her knees and helps
him

LINDA
Jesus Charlie you didnt have to
do this

RANE
I know

Linda tears open the box and starts hauling out the
stereo

LINDA
Wheres a plug

RANE
I also got you some clothes And
some records
(holds package)

TIMECUT Rane and Linda have placed the turntable on
the chair and sit on the floor beside it The two
speakers sit on the floor to their right and left

Linda has put on the clothes Charlie bought for her
The empty bags lie next to her old clothes on the bed
Its just like Christmas

Linda is wearing bellbottom blue jeans black leather
boots and a red turtleneck sweater Aphrodite step
aside

On the floor by the stereo are several opened record
albums Susan Rayes My Heart Has A Mind Of Its Own
Loretta Lynns “Here I Am Again Tanya Tuckers

Delta Dawn and others

MY HEART HAS A MIND OF ITS own

No matter what I do
No matter what I say
I just cant seem to turn
the other way
When Im with someone new
I always think of you
Guess my heart has a mind of its own

LINDA
What are we going to do now
Go back to Corpus

RANE
What do you want to do Well
do whatever you like
LINDA

Put as many miles between me and
Texas as I can Lets go up north
somewhere where its cold Where
theres Eskimos and snow and people
who never leave their houses

(a beat)
And where they make love like
bunnies all day

RANE
(smiles)
Sounds great to me

Linda embraces him

LINDA
Im glad I stuck it out with you
Charlie

RANE

As long as were in El Paso
theres someplace Id like to
go before we leave if its
all right with you

LINDA
Wheres that

RANE
Ive got an old friend that lives
here His name is Johnny Johnny
Vohden (Pronounced voh-dean) I
knew him a long time

LINDA
Yes

RANE

Yeah I knew him for quite a few
years In Hanoi

(a beat)
Im sure hed like some company
He was just a young kid But God
he was a tough one The best of
them all Now there was a real
man I could hear him groaning
at night He would hit the floor
groaning then three minutes later
he would be tapping out Morse
code relays on what had happened
that day and what he had seen TI
would have given my heart to have
helped him then

(a beat)
That was a man

CUT TO

REAL ARMY

INT Johnny Vohdens LIVING ROOM Evening

Nine people are crowded into the Vohdens lower middle-
class living room Charlie and Linda Johnny Vohden
and his wife BETTY-ANN his son JOHN JR aged 10 his
daughter SUZY aged 8 his aging FATHER his SISTER and
BROTHER-IN-LAW

Family photographs sit atop the piano a framed poster
of Yosemite Falls hangs above the worn green sofa A

color TV plays silently in the corner The pea-green

rug is worn through in two places beside the Woolworth
coffee table

With the exception of Charlie Johnny and Linda every-
one else in the room rates pretty low on the interest
scale The old man has one foot in the clouds the
other in the grave The kids are bored shitless and
the sister and brother-in-law chatter aimlessly

Johnny Vohden about 26 lean handsome (we saw him in
the credits) sits sandwiched on the sofa between his
wife and sister He once had soft babyish features

but they have grown prematurely hard and expressionless
He seems very uncomfortable no longer the man Charlie
had described

Johnny wears a Sixties tab-collar white shirt which seems
a size too big for him His hair is still cut short
He looks pathetically from side to side

Linda is wearing the new clothes Charlie bought for her
and Rane wears his freshly pressed and cleaned AF
uniform

Everyone is sipping from an unmatched set of coffee cups
A plate of sugar cookies sits atop a stack of POW pamph-
lets on the coffee table

SISTER
(to Suzy)
Suzy see if anyone else wants some
more cookies

Suzy gets up in perfunctory little girl fashion and
-offers the cookie plate around the crowded room There
are a few takers

SISTER
Col Rane John has said so much
about you You must be the most
famous person we know Youre 4
real hero Thats pretty rare
BROTHERIN-LAW
Yeah there aint many heroes anymore
Everything is buy cheap sell expensive

They wait for Rane to answer he says nothing

SISTER
Thats really some car you got
there Col Rane

Johnny starts a smile

JOHNNY
Yeah

Then swallows it

RANE
Its a little dirty just now

BROTHER-IN-LAW
What kind of engine you got in
there Charlie the 500 cc

RANE
Its a bug un

They all laugh

JOHN JR
The Eldorado is the last factory-
made American convertible All
the other companies stopped making
them Cadillac will probably stop
making ‘em too

BROTHERINLAW
(cutting in)
Those things cost a fortune

SISTER
Then the Japanese will start making
them Well have to start buying
our Cadillac convertibles from Japan
They do everything anyway

BROTHER-IN-LAW
Im just afraid one of them Japs
will get ahold of an atomic bomb
and take it into his basement and
figure out in two weeks how to
make one for 4994 Then every
kook in the country could buy one

Johns father mumbles something

FATHER
Mumble-mumble-mumblemumble

JOHNNY
Whats that Pop What did you say

SISTER
Speak louder Dad

He mumbles a little louder

FATHER
Mumble-mumble-mumble-mumble

JOHNNY
Theyre all made what Pop

SISTER
Niggers He says theyre all
made by niggers

JOHNNY
(confused)
What is the atomic bombs

SISTER
No the American cars stupid

JOHN JR
Thats just grandpaw He always
talks that way

BROTHER-IN-LAW
Yeah Well even white people dont
make things any good no more

BETTY ANN
Theres no more craftsmanship left
in this country I bought that
TV there
(continued )

She gestures at TV A Situation Comedy is playing

BETTY ANN

(continued )
e- from RCA because I wanted to
Buy American during the war and
all but it broke down three weeks
after I got it and when the RCA
man came to fix it he said all the
parts were made in Japan anyway
So next time Im going to buy one
straight from Japan

We see Johnnys face he is bored listless as uneasy
as Charlie was at the outset of the picture He is an
outsider in his own home

Charlies heart goes out to Johnny He remembers the man
he once was They look at each other a moment then
quickly turn away like children caught in the contempla
tion of a crime

The Sister Brother-in-law and Betty Ann for their part
are not knowingly obnoxious They love Johnny and think
they are doing the best thing for him by helping cheer
him up

SISTER
(to Linda)
How about you Linda do you have

a TV

Linda responds cautiously and politely She wishes to
say nothing which would embarrass Charlie

LINDA
Yes I got a Japanese one A
Sony Triniton

BETTY ANN
(to Johnny)
See Some people have some sense

SISTER
That was advertised at the Democratic
Convention wasnt it

BROTHER-IN-LAW

There is a short pause

BETTY ANN
(to Johnny)
You remember Sammy Visser dont

Cowboys He went to El Paso High

in high school

BROTHERINLAW

Johnny just shrugs

SISTER
(changing subject)
Well maybe we should get one of
those Sony Trinitons next time

BROTHERIN-LAW
Our old TV is still good

Charlie looks at Johnny he looks like hes going to puke

JOHN JR
I read someplace that the only
good things Americans still make
are can openers

BROTHER-IN-LAW
(to Betty Ann)
Hows the garage sale coming

Charlie looks at Johnny

BETTY ANN

BETTY ANN

Of course Suzy Suzys going to

she just had a bunch of junk

Chariie looks deeply into Johnnys blank face Deep
inside Johnnys head wheels are slowly turning

Rane politely cuts into the conversation

RANE
Hey Johnny

JOHNNY
Yeah Charlie

RA
(softly)
Come with me a minute Theres
something I want to ask you

JOHNNY
Sure

Charlie gets up and walks toward the bedroom Stepping
over some legs Johnny follows him

Johnnys sister whispers to Betty Ann as they exit

SISTER
(whispering )
They probably want to talk about
the war -

cUT TO JOHN JRS BEDROOM Rane and Johnny are stand-
ing next to the junior-sized bed

Plastic model B-52 F-100 and F-4 fighter planes hang on
threads from the ceiling Charlie and Johnny must look
through the planes to see each other

Rane puts his arm on Johnnys shoulder

RANE
Johnny

JOHNNY
(smiles)
Hiya Charlie

RANE

Rane puts both his hands on Johnnys shoulders and stares
at him compassionately

RANE
Johnny
(a beat)
It dont matter
(a beat)
Lets go Johnny Understand

Johnny looks back at him then slowly smiles

JOHNNY
Yeah Lets tear some ass

Johnny and Charlie walk out of John Jrs bedroom and
slip into the MASTER BEDROOM They hear the VOICES
from the living room as they move from one bedroom to
the other

Johnny closes the door to the MASTER BEDROOM and the
VOICES cease All is quiet

Johnny opens the closet and pulls out his freshly-pressed
sky-blue AF Lts uniform He places it carefully across
the bed He bends down to the floor of the closet
rummages through some boxes and comes up with his

service 45 automatic and a clip He places these on

the bed beside the uniform

TIMECUT Charlie and Johnny standing tall in their
uniforms walk out of the bedroom toward the LIVING ROOM
Johnny has the 45 tucked in his waistband

Betty Ann looks up in horror as she sees them coming

BETTY ANN
(her voice rising)
Where are you going John

JOHNNY

while Ill be back in a couple

Johnny walks toward the front door Betty Ann runs to
him and grabs him desperately

BETTY ANN
No Hes crazy Youve got to

Johnny grabs Betty Ann by the shoulders and shakes her
This not having any effect he slaps her

JOHNNY
Betty Ann

Betty Ann says nothing

Looking back into the living room Johnny waves goodbye
to his father

JOHNNY

Johnnys father returns the wave

CUT TO

FIRE BASE JUAREZ

NIGHT Charlie and Johnny dressed in their uniforms
and smiling broadly from the front seat of a red con-
vertible pass the border guards and cross over the
bridge into Juarez

Just a couple-a soldier boys on the town

Rane drives through the streets of Juarez He pulls
slowly down the road where the brothel is located

Rane cuts his lights and pulls to the side of the curb
Ahead they can see the big white Continental and its
steer-horn ornament

They sit and look a moment then Charlie turns to Johnny

RANE

Theyre all in there Three Mex
and three white One old white
two young Old Mex wears black
suit red tie patched suede boots
Old white named Big Ed looks like

(a beat)
Theyd recognize me so Im going
around back You dog it in and
case the place Lie low till you
hear a shot then come out shooting

TIMECUT Charlie and Johnny stand beside the open trunk

Charlie loads the two nickel-plated 45s and tucks them
into his belt He hefts and loads the Browning double
barrel

Johnny pulls an old AF duffle bag out of the trunk and
shoves some rags into it

Johnny pulls out the sawed-off six-shot Winchester loads
it and places it among the rags in the duffle bag He
pulls out his own 45 and places it in with the Winchester
He puts an extra clip in his pants pocket
104

Johnny zips the duffle bag and hefts it Charlie pulls
out the 357 Magnum and motions for Johnny to load it
for him

Johnny loads the Magnum revolver and Charlie tucks it
into his waistband behind his back

Adjusting himself Charlie closes the trunk

RANE
Ready Lieutenant

JOHNNY
Start the ball rollin Colonel

They slowly walk toward the lighted brothel

Approaching the brothel they split up Charlie crouch-
ing over sneaks around the rear of the building

Johnny swinging his duffle bag saunters down the side-
walk and walks up the steps to the brothel

He is greeted by the MADAM inside the door

MADAM
Hola soldado

JOHNNY
Howdy matam Whats happening
They told me this was a good place
for a soldier to have a good time

MADAM
You come to the right place
soldier-boy

They walk into the parlor An Old Mexican sits on the
sofa singing and playing La Golondrina on his guitar

JOHNNY
I want a nice pretty young lady
(forms outline with
hands)
Lindo Very lindo

MADAM

He does noticing a couple house thugs as he goes She
takes him into an ancillary room where two young girls
are sitting

MADAM

(to Johnny)
This is Candy Muy lindo

JOHNNY

MADAM

dollars half hour The best

English

JOHNNY

Johnny pulls out thirty dollars and gives it to the Madam
Candy stands looks at Johnny and says

CANDY
Va

Candy walks up the central bannister as Johnny duffle
bag in hand follows We have ample opportunity to study
the layout of the brothel

When he reaches the top of the stairs Johnny hears the
LOUD VOICES of several men We recognize one of the
voices T-Bird

Candy walks one way down the carpeted corridor while
Johnny intentionally walks the other way Candy calls
him back

CANDY
Hey gringo

Johnny peeks into one room and sees a pair of multi-
colored suede patches boots on the floor Love-making
sounds come from within the room

JOHNNY
(to Candy)
No rooms here

CANDY
This way
(gestures)

Johnny listens in on the next room he passes He hears
a card game in progress

MELIO
Paso

T-BIRD
Marca two dollars

SECOND TEXAN
Paso

Candy calls back to Johnny

CANDY
Coming

JOHNNY
Sure am

Johnny follows Candy down the hallway She enters a
small room and he follows

‘ INSIDE the ROOM Candy closes the door behind them
Johnny sits on the edge of the bed placing the duffle
bag at his feet

JOHNNY
Boy am I tired honey

CUT TO REAR OF BROTHEL A young MEXICANAMERICAN
stands guard by a rear stairway

Setting his shotgun down Rane walks over to the Mexican
Before the Mexican can reach for his small revolver
Charlie claps his hand

RANE
Listen amigo why dont you just
scram All hells gonna break
out inside there and you aint
gonna wanna be around

The Mexican-American seems confused

MEXICAN-AMERICAN
I guard here No one comes in

Rane puts his hand on the Mexican-Americans face as if
he were giving him a benediction

RANE
Itm not fooling son If you dont
leave youll be dead

Rane pushes his face away

The young Mexican-American does not take his advice
instead he reaches for his revolver Rane wrenches the
Mexican-Americans arm behind his back spins him around
and reaching around with his sharpened hook slices
open his throat

The Mexican-American gurgles a moment then falls over
Charlie walks back to pick up his shotgun

CUT TO CANDYS ROOM Johnny sits on the edge of the
bed his ears cocked waiting listening

Strains of La Golondrina can be heard in the background

CANDY
You just sit there

JOHNNY
I aint got much energy left
baby Youre going to have to
help me

With a sigh of resignation Candy walks over to the bed
and begins unbuttoning Johnnys AF shirt Johnnys ears
are perked listening for even the slightest sound

CUT TO EXT STAIRWAY Carrying the Browning shotgun
Rane stealthily walks up the rear stairs The two
nickel-plated 45s in his waistband glimmer in the
moonlight

Reaching the top of the stairs Charlie peeks into the
corridor It is empty He enters

Rane tiptoes down the carpeted corridor listening and
looking as he goes

CUT TO CANDYS ROOM Candy having removed Johnnys
shirt and undershirt unties his shoes and pulls them
off The socks follow

Listening closely Johnny hears Charlies footsteps coming
down the hall He is all ears now

As Candy reaches for Johnnys belt buckle his hand drops
down toward his duffle bag revealing the guns

Ranes FOOTSTEPS tiptoe down the hall

Candy loosens Johnnys belt She puts her hand in his
waistband

cU Johnnys hand slips into the duffle bag and clasps
the handle of the 45

CUT TO CORRIDOR Charlie looks through an ajar door
he sees the patched suede boots sitting on the floor

Hoisting the huge Browning B-SS waist level he poises
himself and slowly kicks the door open

The door slowly opens inside the Mexican lies rutting
with a whore

Rane waits for the Mexican to notice him

The Mexicants eyes look up and recognize Charlie Rane
says softly

RANE
Stand up amigo Die on your feet

The Mexican slowly gets up The whore crouches at the
rear of the bed in horror

MEXICAN
Ah Texican you are such a macho

Rane discharges both barrels of the Browning blowing
both the Mexican and his whore into the wallpaper

CUT CANDYS ROOM Johnny hears the blast grabs his
-45 out of the duffle bag and smashes Candy across the
face with it She reels against the far wall

JOHNNY
Bitch

Johnny reaches into the duffle bag with his other hand
and pulls out the sawed-off pump shotgun

Candy SCREAMS

Carrying a gun in each hand Johnny bursts out of Candys
room and Jumps into the CORRIDOR

He arrives in time to see Charlie chucking down the
Browning B-SS and pulling one of the nickel-plated 45s
from his waistband

Their eyes meet The brothel is filled with the sounds
of SCREAMING and PANIC No more La Golondrina

RANE
Johnny

JOHNNY
Charlie

Johnny tucks his 45 into his waist and they each move
toward a door

A door opens a drunken T-Bird is looking up from the
bottle-strewn card table in bewilderment Melio scrambles
for a gun The Second Texan holds a long knife

T-BIRD
Hot damn

SECOND TEXAN
Sheeit

Three successive blasts from Johnnys 12 gauge pump
shotgun send the poker players flying in every direction
We notice a bit of T-Bird here a bit of Melio (in
orange pants) there The bodies of a couple women join
-the melee

The Second Texan SCREAMING covered with blood and hold
ing his knife charges toward Johnny Another blast
from the Winchester sends him spinning backwards

Rane pushes open his door and finds there an innocent
American businessman cowering under the bed and a
frightened whore cowering atop it Rane is too keyed
up to stop now he plugs them both with the 045 first
the American then the whore

Rane steps back into the corridor next to Johnny There
is the SOUND of running feet from the end of the cor-
ridor Charlie turns and fires Candys bloody body
rolls down the carpet

There is a sharp RETORT from the opposite end of the
corridor Charlie grimaces Blood spreads from a
bullet wound in his side

Johnny wheels around and sees Big Ed standing behind
Charlie with a smoking 38 in his hand Big Ed is
wearing his unbuttoned lime green Western shirt with
the rhinestone wagon wheels on it Two blasts from
Johnnys shotgun send Big Ed bouncing on his butt
down the hall

Johnny throws down the shotgun and pulls his 45

One door remains unopened on the second floor Johnny
and Charlie approach it with their 45s drawn at arms
length

Two young half-naked Mexicans one of them Big Eds
chauffeur burst out of the room firing their revolvers

They are cut down in the crossfire of 45 Slugs Johnny
catches a surface wound in his right forearm

Johnny ducks down crossing in front of the opening at the
top of the stairs A bullet flies past his head as he
runs

He notices several Mexican thugs standing at the foot
of the stairs out of the corner of his eyes They have
drawn guns

There is no immediate danger Johnny and Charlie rest
a moment looking at each other across the bannister
opening

It is possible for them to retreat out the back stairs
but they do not

Charlie drops his 45 and pulls a freshly loaded one
from his waist His shirt is soaked with blood

Johnny discharges the spent clip from his 45 and inserts
a fresh one from his pocket

They look at each other a moment deciding what to do

Charlie yells to Johnny in Vietnamese

Chung ta di di

Johnny replies

JOHNNY
Death Da Nang Hanoil

They jump into the bannister opening and rapidly dis
charge their automatics down the stairs

A Mexican falls at the foot of the stairs Charlie
catches another bullet in the chest and falls down
the stairs

Johnny calls to him as he falls

JOHNNY
Charlie Charlie
ill

Johnny is hit in the upper shoulder with a 38 He is
stopped but for a second then comes back firing An-
other Mexican falls Only one remains

Blood flows down Johnnys right breast

Charlie yanks the 357 out of his back pulls himself
up on the bannister and blasts the remaining Mex across
the blood-spattered room

Simultaneously Charlie catches a slug in his throat
Trying to speak he gurgles blood and dies

Though Charlies killer is already dead Johnny plugs
him again And again

There are no more men at the foot of the stairs Only
bloody bodies scared whores and a discarded guitar

The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS up the stairs from Charlies dead
body to Johnny still standing at the top of the stairs
He stands bareback in bare feet his belt hanging loose
Blood covers his right breast and left forearm Con-
torted bodies lie on the floor behind him

There is a 45 in his hand He is SCREAMING at the top
of his lungs

His gun 1s empty but Johnny cannot stop firing it His
finger manickly pulls the trigger CLICK CLICK CLICK
CLICK CLICK CLICK

The image FREEZE FRAME SOUND abruptly HALTS

Johnny is caught mid-trigger pull his mouth frozen open
in a never-ending scream Keyed-up ready to go A
force in motion unable to stop Pure energy

The FREEZE FRAME HOLDS as we hear only the SOUND of
ROLLING THUNDER

THE END
