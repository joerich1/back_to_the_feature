EXT DESERT - DAY

From a distance we see a Humvee sitting alone in the middle
of a huge empty desert Just the Humvee nothing else for
miles We hear the sound of a man making machine gun-like
noises

CU - HUMVEE

There are three soldiers at the Humvee Second Lieutenant
JOHN EPPS who sweeps the horizon with a
pair of binoculars PFC WES HAMMOND who is behind the wheel
looking very bored and PFC MARK JAEGER who is at the
Humvees thirty caliber machine gun making the noises and
shooting at phantom troops When Jaeger talks its with all
the swagger of a B-movie hero

JAEGER
At-at-at-at-at At-at-at-at-at

EPPS
What are you doing

JAEGER
What does it look like Im doing Im
killing Iraqis At-at-at-at-at At-at-

WES
Could you stop please Youre giving me
a headache

JAEGER
A headache

WES
Yeah a headache My head hurts Youre
making me uncomfortable

JAEGER
Im making you uncomfortable Baking
away in a desert in the middle of nowhere
facing three-hundred-thousand screaming
Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles that
doesnt bother you But me making a
little noise is driving you out of your
skull

WES
Yes Yes Thats exactly it Yes

JAEGER
Okay

Jaeger goes right back to playing soldier

JAEGER (CONT)
At-at-at-at-at

EPPS
Knock it off

JAEGER
Dont get pissed at me just cause I
want to be ready when this war starts

EPPS
Ready for what What are you supposed to
be doing

JAEGER
I told you Im shooting Iraqis

EPPS
No youre not

Epps points in the opposite direction that Jaeger was
firing

EPPS (CONT)
The Iraqis are that way Those are our
troops youre shooting at

With his binoculars Epps looks in the direction Jaeger was
shooting

EPPS (CONT)
You know what I think you got
Schwarzkopf You did You got the
General right in the ass Now thats
good shooting

JAEGER
Blow me

EPPS
Another month in this desert and I might
just

WES
Think were going to do it Think were
going to war

EPPS
Not up to us Up to the Iraqis All
they have to do is get out of Kuwait

JAEGER
We ought to kick their asses anyway
Even if they do get out of Kuwait we
ought to kick their asses

WES
I dont think well go to war We
shouldnt even be here This isnt our
fight its a regional conflict It
should be decided regionally

JAEGER
People are suffering

WES
People were suffering in Afganistan and
we didnt do anything

EPPS

Thats cause the Afganis werent smart
enough to be sitting on top of oil
People suffering is one thing but when
the Yuppies arent going to have enough
gas for their BMWs its time to break out
the tanks Come on Pack up Weve got
a whole lot of nothing to patrol

As they pack up and get ready to roll on Jaeger says almost

to himself

JAEGER
We ought to kick their asses Either way
we ought to

EXT STREET BAZAAR - EVENING

The bazaar

their wares to each passerby

CUT TO

is loud and colorful a cacophony of Arabic fills
the air The bazaar is filled with vendors actively selling

literally shoving them in the
faces of prospective customers

Epps Wes and Jaeger walk along side by side looking almost
like the Three Musketeers except that Wes is droning on

WES
And its very important when you sit
down never to point the soles of your
shoes at anyone Its considered
offensive

EPPS
You know so much about the Middle East
you know where we can get something to
eat

JAEGER
When do you ever point the soles of your
feet at people

WES
Im saying dont do it accidently

JAEGER
Oh yeah Accidently

Jaeger lifts his leg and purposefully points the bottom of
his foot at a vendor

JAEGER (CONT)
Im sorry My foot accidently jumped up
in the air where you could see the bottom
of it I hate it when that happens

(Wes slaps Jaegers leg down)

WES
Come on Youre going to get us in
trouble

JAEGER
It was an accident You saw it was an
accident

WES

Im just trying to help you guys out It
doesnt hurt to know something about
Saudi Arabia

EPPS
Like learning Arabic Youre gonna learn
Arabic you might as well learn were we
can get something to eat around here

WES
I didnt learn Arabic because we were
getting shipped here You dont learn it
in a couple of weeks I studied it in
high school

JAEGER
Spanish wasnt hard enough

WES
I thought it would be good to know

JAGER
Yeah if you ever need to buy a rug

WES
Hey Jaeger Why dont you try this
Ashra Ka mahari dahra sahib

JAEGER
What does that mean

WES
Dont shoot me Im friendly You can
use that when you surrender

JAEGER
How do you say Come here baby Im
horny I can use that now

WES

Dont even try it You offend a woman
out here youre in serious trouble

EPPS
Dont worry about Jaeger He uses his
personality as a form of birth control

JAEGER
Blow me Have I said that to you guys
recently Blow me

As Epps and Wes walk on Jaeger notices something on a
VENDORS table It is a small square box - slightly larger
than a mans palm - fashioned of wood and metal It is not
particularly ornate but eye catching in its own way The
instant Jaeger picks it up and begins to look it over the
Vendor is giving him the hard sell in Arabic Jaeger holds
the box up to the vendor
JAEGER (CONT)
What is this

All he gets is more Arabic Jaeger calls over to Wes

JAEGER (CONT)
Hey Wes Wes

Wes comes back over to Jaeger

JAEGER (CONT)
What is this

WES
Now you need me

JAEGER
What is it You know so much about
Arabland tell me what it is

Wes looks over the box carefully

WES
Well based on my knowledge of the
region its culture and her people I
would have to say its a box

EPPS
Can you eat it If you cant eat it I
really dont care what it is

JAEGER
Ask him what it is

Wes says something to the vendor in Arabic The Vendor
answers back

WES
He says its a box

JAEGER
Yeah youre funny

WES
Its a puzzle box If you can figure out
how to open it theres supposed to be a
treasure inside

JAEGER
(Excited)
For real A treasure
EPPS
Oh man youre not going to fall for
that

JAEGER
There might be something in there

EPPS
Yeah the deed to the Brooklyn bridge

JAEGER
There might be

WES
And youre the guy whos going to open
it

JAEGER
I could

EPPS

You could turn on a light if someone put
your hand on the switch

Decisively without even haggling about price Jaeger whips
out some money and pays the vendor for the box

EPPS (CONT)
Well that showed me Now can we eat

The three men walk on Jaeger starting to work on the puzzle box
CUT TO
INT BARRACKS - NIGHT

Its filled with young soldiers messing around playing
cards listening to music whatever Jaeger lays on a bunk
holding the puzzle box probing it with his fingers trying
to find a way to make it open

Wes crosses over

WES
You get it yet

JAEGER
Naw nothing

WES
You will Youll get it
JAEGER
Ill show Epps Hell be sorry when I
get this thing open

WES
You really think theres a treasure
inside

JAEGER

I dont care if theres a lump of coal in
here I just want to be able to rub
Epps face in it when I crack this thing

Wes watches Jaeger work the box for a beat

WES
Jaeger

JAEGER
What

WES

You know the fifteenth is the deadline
for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait

JAEGER
Yeah So

WES
Thats in two days

JAEGER
Like I said so

WES
Theyre cancelling all leaves all
passes No more drills We stand at
full ready starting--

JAEGER
Whats your point Wes You have a
point

WES
Were going to war arent we If

theyre doing all that it must mean were
going to war

JAEGER
It doesnt mean anything

WES

Why would they do all that if we werent
Jaeger frustrated finally looks up from his box

JAEGER
Okay so were going to war Were
supposed to go to war Were soldiers
thats what we do The guns the tanks
the planes youre just now getting the
hint were in the war business

Jaeger goes back to his box Wes stands over him for a beat
longer then

WES
Jaeger
JAEGER
(For sure aggravated)
What
WES

You ever think about dying

JAEGER
Come on man I almost had this thing open

WES
You ever think about it You ever worry

JAEGER
The only thing I worry about is how much
Iraqi ass Im going to be able to kick
before this whole thing is over The
only people who Ive got anything to worry
about are the poor dumb camel jockeys
who dont know enough to get out of the
way when I come rolling at them an M-16
in each hand and a grenade between my
teeth Now if youll excuse me soldier
Id like to get back to my box Ive got
a treasure to find

Wes lingers over Jaeger for a few more beats then walks off as

Its like the opening scene all over again Jaeger is at the
machine gun Epps sweeps the horizon with his binoculars and
Wes is behind the wheel Only difference is that Wes watches
CNN footage of the air war on a Watchman

Jaeger gets down from the machine gun pulls out his puzzle
box and starts to work on it again

JAEGER
This is stupid Its going on a month

Air Force piss on those bastards They
can bomb them all they want Saddam aint
going anywhere without a ground assault
What the hell is the army waiting for

EPPS
Why you in such a hurry to get to
shooting

JAEGER
Ive got to have something to tell people
when I get home besides I protected a
stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for
nothing in the first place

WES
The longer the air force hits the Iraqis
the safer itII be for us when we have to
engage

JAEGER
You know what Wes If you get a note
from your mommy they might excuse you
from the war

EPPS
You all want to lay off God I hope

Startled Epps and Wes each pull their guns and spin in
Jaegers direction expecting to have to fire at something

EPPS
What What

JAEGER
I did it I got the box open
Jaeger has indeed opened the box We can see something
inside of it

EPPS
You almost got yourself shot thats
what you did

Wes excitedly goes over to Jaeger

WES
Whats inside

Jaeger pulls out a small tube sealed with wax

JAEGER
ItsitsI dont know what it is

WES
Its a container Break the seal

Jaeger hesitates a beat which heightens a bit of suspense
All three men cant help but be drawn closer to the container

EPPS
Go on man

Jaeger pokes his finger through the wax and pulls it off the
tube He sticks his finger back into the container and draws
out a rolled up piece of paper

WES
Paper

EPPS
Its a fortune box

Jaeger unrolls it

WES
Whats it say

EPPS
Help Im being held prisoner in a puzzle
box factory

We see the paper Lines are drawn on it large crude
figures Its hard to make out exactly what it all is
supposed to represent

JAEGER
Its a drawing or something Some kind
of art
Epps takes the paper from Jaeger and gives it a once over

EPPS
Looks like something a kid would do

Wes takes the paper and looks it over

WES
Its a map I think thats what it is

EPPS
There you go Jaeger Just find the
buried treasure and youre a
millionaire

Jaeger takes back the paper All excited like a kid on
Christmas

JAEGER
You think

EPPS
Yeah thats exactly what I think You
and the five thousand other suckers who
bought those boxes Lets get out of
here We got sand to protect

Epps and Wes load up and get ready to move out Jaeger just
keeps staring at the map eyes lit like candles

INT BARRACKS - LATER

Maps and photos cover Jaegers bunk the way autumn leaves
cover the ground He swings between studying the maps and
reading from a book titled A History Of The Ottoman Empire
Jaeger puts the book down then slides the drawing from the
puzzle box up next to one of the recon photos He looks at
the mosaic hes put together looks at it like it was having
a dialogue with him Dig it It is talking A voice only
Jaeger can hear Right now its just a little whisper but
the voice is getting louder

A crossing SOLDIER carrying a football calls to Jaeger

SOLDIER
Come on Jaeger Were playing ball

Jaeger fairly jumps as he comes out of his trance

JAEGER
No thats okay Im gonnaIm doing some

The soldier crosses off Jaeger goes back to staring at his

guys a walking atlas

Epps looks on in shock at the spectacle

EPPS
I think youve got some issues to deal
with Really when we get out of here
Im pretty sure its shrink time for you

JAEGER
Just listen to me Ive been doing some
reading In the Sixteenth century this
region was invaded by the Turks It
became part of the Ottoman empire When
the Turks rolled in they raped they
pillaged the usual stuff Anybody who
had anything wanted to hide it from these
bastards They buried their treasures
drew maps and hid the maps in puzzle
boxes I read about this man I read
about it

EPPS
(Sarcastic)
Wellllll if you read it it must be true
Was it in the Star or the Enquirer

JAEGER
Christ Wes tell him You know this
stuff

WES

The Turks invaded yeah I guess people
would have hidden what they had But
that doesnt mean what was in that box
is--

Jager holds up the puzzle box drawing to one of the maps

JAEGER
Looks at this Look at it The drawing
is a map of this area right here You
can see it The geography the
landmarks Its the same area

Epps grabs the map from Jaeger

EPPS
And you know what that area is Its
Iraq IRAQ Were doing a little thing
with them right now Desert Storm Maybe
youve read about it

JAEGER
What were doing is kicking ass For
Gods sake they got Iraqis surrendering
to news crews The war is over Weve
just got to keep shooting people cause
the army spent all this money and weve
got to put on a show for the taxpayers

WES
Youre not saying what I think youre
saying I cant believe youre even
thinking it

JAEGER
Its right here This region an-Nagaf
I got recon photos Therere no troops
there no fighting--

WES
You dont know where the Iraqis have
moved to And our forces havent even
engaged the Republican Guard yet we
dont know--

JAEGER
Its about a hundred miles from where we
are now How long do you think it would
take us to--

WES
Its not a hundred miles Its a hundred
miles through three different kinds of
terrain Pure desert mountains a
river If the map is even real

JAEGER
Its real Im telling you its real

WES
So you just want to cross into hostile
territory in the middle of a war ona
wild goose chase Its crazy Tell him
its crazy Epps

Epps thinks He doesnt say nuthin just thinks Its the
thinking that makes Wes nervous

WES (CONT)
Epps tell him

Epps gets a little more thinking in Wes sees which way this
is going

WES
Youre out of your minds you know that
Both of you You dont even know if
theres anything out there What the
hell are you thinking

EPPS
Im thinking about when this war is over
Why you figure Im here Cause I got
tired of being president of GM If a
brother doesnt play ball or deal drugs
there arent too many big money prospects
around and Im not particularly
interested in spending the rest of my
life fighting the oil companies wars
So I say if maybe theres something out
there what the hell thats what I say

Wes cant believe what hes hearing He pulls out the last
card he has to play

WES
Its desertion

Jaeger sweeps a hand across the great nothingness
JAEGER
Deserting what What the hell are we

Both Jaeger and Epps close on Wes for the hard sell
EPPS

JAEGER

Jaeger hands Epps a piece of electronic hardware no bigger
than a video box Its a navigational computer which can
pinpoint its location by satellite within meters
Basically the ultimate compass Epps compares the navicoms
readout with the map

EPPS
You know you sound just like a boy whos
never-—-

WES

Whats that

Jaeger and Epps look out the front windshield A plume of
sand rises up from the desert several hundred meters before
them So engrossed in their discussion previously they
hadnt even noticed until Wes pointed it out

Epps reaches over and kills the tape player A loud quiet
comes with it All three men just stare at the plume as it
drifts closer Finally

EPPS
Take the binoculars

JAEGER
Wh-what do you think--

EPPS
TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS

Jaeger scrambles up the binoculars and stares off into the
distance Epps and Wes waitthey wait

JAEGER
Iraqis

WES

WES
Oh Jesus

JAEGER

JAEGER

EPPS
We run theyll shoot us anyway If we
keep driving they might think we
friendlies Iraqis Or even if they know
were Americans they might get scared
think were part of a detachment and keep
on going

JAEGER
Theyre not going to--

EPPS
Its the only way We drive

Epps is right Jaeger and Wes know it They shut up and
ride Dig that tension Wes sweating Epps giving the wheel
a white knuckle grip Jaeger reaches down and readies his M-
16 When he chambers it it sounds like thunder cracking

The plume draws closer and closer until its not just a
plume but two dots Then its two jeep-like vehicles Next

we can even make out the passengers

That doesnt do much to relax our boys
Us the Iraqis were almost on top of each other now The
vehicles are going to pass within feet Epps throws in one
more thing

EPPS
Wave at them Dont look just wave

All three throw up some weak forced waves THE VEHICLES
PASS Look at that The Iraqis are waving back And thats
all theyre doing just waving

Our boys break out into cheers

JAEGER
Yeah Yeah

WES

Im going to toss

JAEGER
You see that Right by us They went
right by You had them Epps you called
it

EPPS
Figure they dont want to mess with us
anymore than we want to mess with them

JAEGER
Look at you not even breaking a sweat
Youre cool boy Youre cool

They all have a good laugh but Wes brings that to a crashing
halt Looking back at the Iraqis in a voice dead with fear

WES
They stopped

EPPS
Wha

WES
Oh Jesus theyve stopped

Epps and Jaeger look behind them

WES (CONT)
They stopped and theyve turned around

The two Iraqi vehicles have stopped theyve turned and now
theyre racing towards our boys Epps momentarily freezes
Jaeger helps him right out of it

JAEGER
Go go go

Epps punches it and the Hummer takes off The Iraqis are
right behind them

The vehicles all do same hard driving They twist and turn
like wild snakes over the loose sand hit dunes take
flight Its the open desert and our boys have nowhere to
hide

nside the Hummer its a rough rough ride Our boys are
thrown violently about the cabin For Epps controlling the
Hummer is about as easy as riding a wild horse

The Iraqis turn things up a notch and start sending gunfire
our way Bullets kick up around the Hummer like angry
little bees with a hell of a sting Epps yells at Jaeger

EPPS
Shoot them

Now its Jaeger whos freezes Epps returns the favor

EPPS (CONT)
Shoot em

Jaeger climbs back to the Humvees machine gun works the
action and starts firing Unlike before when he was playing
the real thing is much wilder The Humvee bounces around
like a cork in the ocean Taking aim is nearly impossible
The best Jaeger can do is squeeze off rounds in the Iraqis
general direction

All Wes can do is cover his head and stay down like a scared
little girl

JAEGER
Steady it out

EPPS
I steady it out they blow us out of the
sand

Its like a dog fight in the dirt The vehicles weave
cut One of the Iraqis starts to cut across Jaegers firing
line Jaeger swings the machine gun around hard and lets
loose A hail of bullets rips into the Iraqi vehicle just
above wheel level It kicks the vehicle up and back
whipping and twisting it horribly in the air time after time
then smashing it back into the ground

Jaeger is beside himself

JAEGER
I got him You see that I nailed him

As if in answer the remaining Iraqi vehicles gunner tears
off a salvo that eats up the space right around Jaeger Hes
not hit but it kicks him back down into the Humvee screaming
with fear

EPPS
Damn it

The boys are running out of options and Epps knows it

EPPS (CONT)
Wes take the wheel

No good Wes is too scared to move Epps reaches back and
literally pulls him up and over into the front

EPPS (CONT)
Take it

With little finesse Wes takes the wheel as Epps slides over
Epps takes up an M-16 with a grenade launcher He loads it
up and readies the weapon Crawling to the back he takes
aim

EPPS (CONT)
Keep it steady

Wes does his best to give a level ride but the Iraqi bullets
coming at them dont help much

Epps zeroes in on the target He takes aim and starts to
squeeze back on the trigger He almost has a shot off when
Wes hits a dune rocking the Hummer violently Epps loses the
target

EPPS (CONT)
Damn it I said keep it steady

Epps tries to take aim again Careful aim One shot is all
he gets The bullets keep coming but hes in no hurry
Waitingwaiting The Iraqis are only getting closer

WES
Shootshoot
Waiting

Closer

SHOOT

EPPS FIRES The grenade rips from the launcher riding a
trail of white smoke and slams into the Iraqis You know
the story Huge explosion car parts flying a hundred feet
into the air bodies whipping through space stuff Bob Dole
would hate But maybe he would like it They were just
Iraqis

Wes brings the Hummer to a halt A spastic scared relieved
laugh escapes him Jaeger checking himself for wounds and
Epps M-16 still in hand get out Epps makes his way to the
wreckage sweeping it with his rifle ready to blast any
survivors Yeah like somebodys walking away from that
bang

Wes finally makes his way over to the others who stand and
stare at the burning hulk of whatever it was

WES
I thought we were dead

JAEGER
Yeah well were not

WES
We got to get out of here

Nobody says anything This really scares Wes

WES (CONT)
We have to go back

JAEGER
Were not going anywhere Not til we
get what we came for

WES
(Incredulous)
We just about got killed You know what
happened We just about got killed and
you want to go on

EPPS
Jaeger go check out the Hummer for
damage
Jaeger starts to cross back to the Hummer Wes gives him
something to take with him

WES
Youre crazy you know that Youre
insane

Jaeger goes leaving Epps and Wes all by their lonesome Wes
turns to Epps

WES (CONT)
You know that right You know hes
sick

With a flip of his head Epps indicates the dead Iraqis

EPPS
They shouldnt have been here

WES
We shouldnt have been here Epps There
is a war going on

EPPS
This is miles from the battle lines
They were probably deserters

WES
Deserters would have run they wouldnt
have engaged

EPPS
They shouldnt have been out this way
thats all Im saying

Wes starts to get it It really doesnt matter what he has
to say

WES
Were not going back are we

Epps has got nothing to say to the truth He turns and
starts to walk to the Hummer

WES (CONT)
You bastard Youre trying to get us
killed

Like a whip Epps snaps around He grabs up Wes and pulls him
close
EPPS
Im trying to get us paid Im trying to
get us all paid As long as theres a
chance something is out there we go on
Theres not going to be anymore trouble
If there is we go back but there wont
be

Almost as an afterthought Epps realizes hes got Wes and
lets him go Gently he puts it

EPPS (CONT)
Youll feel different after we find the
treasure Money has away of making
people feel different

Nobodys got anytbing to say to that so they say nothing
Epps heads back to the Hummer A beat later Wes follows

Jaeger is already behind the wheel Epps rides shotgun this
time Once again Wes is in back To Jaeger Epps ask

EPPS
She okay

JAEGER
Yeah Yeah shes fine

EPPS
Lets go

Jaeger fires it up and pulls out As they head off we
FADE TO
BLACK

FADE TO
IE HUMVEE - LATER

The sun beats down violently as the Hummer rolls along
Epps Jaeger and Wes all ride along in an angry silence
Jaeger starts to smile He chuckles to himself Epps
looking for anything to break the tension smiles a bit
himself

EPPS
What

JAEGER
Im just thinking you know if the rest
of the boys knew what were doing I
mean if they knew what we were coming
back with

EPPS
You cant tell anybody about this

JAEGER
I know I know But Im saying if they
knew Were going to be millionaires
man Millionaires

Epps joins in cackling like a Hyena

EPPS
Itd make their heads explode

JAEGER
Millionaires man

He turns back to Wes
JAEGER (CONT
You know were going to be rich Admit

it You know Come on admit it

In spite of himself Wes gives a little smile

JAEGER (CONT)
Ahh there it is There it is You know
it
Singing to Levert
EPPS

Money money money moneyMONEY
Jaeger joins in

EPPS JAEGER
Money money money moneyMONEY

Epps starts to slow down

WES
What are you doing

EPPS
Low on gas Got to refill

A nervous look punches it way onto Jaegers face Epps
stops He and Wes jump out of the Hummer and go around back
to the reserve tanks

Jaeger stays in the vehicle looking all tense After a beat
Epps screams for him

EPPS (0C)
JaegerJAEGER

Time to face the music Jaeger hauls himself out of the
Hummer and goes around to Epps whos got a look on his face
like hes just had a spoonful of steaming shit He points
angrily at one of the reserve tanks

EPPS
Look at it LOOK AT IT Shot to hell
Its been leaking gas since the fire
fight I told you to check for damage

JAEGER
I know

EPPS
And you missed this How are you going
to miss something like this

JAEGER
I didnt miss it I figured if you knew
one of the reserves got hit youd want to
turn back

WES
So you just let us drive on knowing we
were losing fuel Knowing we were going
to run low in the middle of nowhere

JAEGER
l figuredI figured youd turn back

Wes gets a slow boil on

WES
You stupid son of a bitch

Wes lunges for Jaeger but doesnt have the speed or the
skills Jaeger counters and sinks a fist into Wes jaw

Wes goes down but he manages to take Jaeger to the sand with
him They start to scrape but its obvious Jaeger has got
the upper hand

Epps reaches down and yanks Jaeger off of Wes

EPPS
Get off him

Jaeger comes up to his feet Wes wipes some blood from his
lips He looks down at his bloodied hand then sneers at
Jaeger

EPPS (CONT)
You two fightings not going to get us
anything

WES
Him getting us stranded out here doesnt
do much good either

JAEGER
Were not stranded Weve got enough gas
in the other reserve to get us back

WES
Then lets go back while we still can

JAEGER
As soon as we hit the mountain we would
have had to go on foot anyway Were not
that far We can make it

EPPS
What do we do with the Humvee

JAEGER
We leave it

WES
What if someone takes it

Jaeger throws his arms wide to the empty desert

JAEGER
Who Whos going to take it We mark
the location with the navicom we can
come right back to this spot

Wes has had enough

WES
You two dont even know how crazy you
are You want to go on your sick little
treasure hunt then go ahead but mark me
absent

JAEGER
You have to go with us Wes
WES
Really What is that an order private

JAEGER
You have to go with us You cant walk
back

Jaeger dangles the keys to the Humvee from a finger

JAEGER CONT)
And you sure as hell arent going to
drive

Wes burns a hole through Jaegers head with his eyes Epps
steps to him

EPPS
Load what you can water tools weapons
Anything you think we might need

Wes burns on a bit more then turns and heads for the Hummer
Jaeger watches him go then smiles to himself

JAEGER
Whos he kidding He wants it as bad as
we do Were going to be fat Epps As
soon as we get back to Saudivillie you
and me are going to--

Epps gets up in Jaegers face The menace he projects is
very real

EPPS
Were going to keep going cause I want
some of whatevers out there But you
ever pull something like trying to get my
ass stranded out here again and Ill
kill you myself You got that

Jaeger just stands there his fear swelling

EPPS (CONT)
SAY IT

JAEGER
I got thatsir

Epps storms over towards the Hummer leaving Jaeger to be all
scared with himself

CUT TO
EXT DESERT - LATER

A long line of footprints works their way through the sand up
to Epps Jaeger and Wes Epps and Wes trek side by side

Jaeger is behind them having trouble keeping up Between
pants he gasps

JAEGER
Hey-hey Slow up You dont have to
go so fast

EPPS
Faster we get there faster we get back

JAEGER
Yeah I know Im with you

Jaeger struggles on just a bit more then

JAEGER (CONT)
Im gonnaIm just gonna stop for a
little water

EPPS
Dont drink up all of yours cause you
arent getting any of ours

JAEGER
Im just going to have a little sip
thats all Just a sip

Jaeger lets himself drop down into the sand He looks up
Epps and Wes are still walking

JAGER CONT)
Wait for me

EPPS
You can catch up

JAEGER
YeahIm right behind you

Wes looks back at Jaeger sitting on the ground sucking on his
water

WES
Thanks for straightening out Jaeger

Epps shrugs like hitting Jaeger wasnt much of anything
EPPS
Maybe we are crazy for doing this But
if we do it we do it right I just
needed to explain that in a way I
wouldnt have to do it again

WES
Not much chance of that Jaegers an
idiot

EPPS

Hes not so--

WES
Hes an idiot and hes not nearly as
hard as he thinks

EPPS

How tough you have to be to make the
army All youve got to do is shoot a
gun and stop a bullet

Again Epps looks behind him as Jaeger struggles to his feet
and stumbles after his two comrades

WES
Look at him We ought to just leave him
behind

Epps gives a little laugh like hes just heard a mildly
amusing punchline

WES (CONT)
Like he said People get lost in wars
all the time And out here Out here
there are eight million ways to die

All this talk starts to creep out Epps a little

EPPS
Okay so he was riding you Get over it

Wes smiles a little smile

WES
Im just talking

They walk on

Jaeger works to catch up muttering to himself as he goes
JAEGER
Cant even slow up for me Wasnt for me
they wouldnt even be here Im the one
that found the map Should have just
come by myself Shouldve Shouldnt
even cut them in Shouldnt

As Jaeger steps down be hears an audible clicking sound come
from under his boot He goes dead still Panic races up and
down his spine In almost a whisper be says

JAEGER
Epps

Again louder

JAEGER (CONT)
Epps

Like he couldnt be more annoyed Epps turns around

EPPS
What

JAEGER
Mine

Epps isnt sure of what hes heard

EPPS
What

JAEGER
Mine Land mine

Epps doesnt say anything he just keeps on staring Scared
angry they dont get it

JAEGER (CONT)
I stepped on a land mine

Epps and Wes look at each other then back to Jaeger Like
hes got no time to mess around

EPPS
You didnt step on any mine

JAEGER
I heard it click

EPPS
If you stepped on a mine youd be dead by
now Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines
anymore

JAEGER
I heard it

WES
Maybe its just a can or something

Jaeger loses it

JAEGER
JESUS CHRIST IM STANDING ON A MINE
SHUT UP AND GET OVER HERE

Just plain sick of all this Epps and Wes trudge back over to
Jaeger

EPPS
Paranoid thats your problem Youre
just paranoid Whyd the paranoid one
have to find the map

Epps pulls a knife from his belt He sinks to the ground and
probes the sand under Jaegers foot Nothingnothing

WE HEAR THE SOUND OF METAL AGAINST METAL Epps goes white
For a second he doesnt move Tension falls like a steel
curtain Slow careful Epps withdraws the blade and stands
Jaeger reads the expression on Epps face

JAEGER
Oh God Oh God

EPPS
Just be cool

JAEGER
Its a mine isnt it

EPPS
Just relax

JAEGER
Howm I gonna relax standing on a mine

EPPS
Were going to get off all right Well
get you off of there Justbe cool

Epps goes to Wes The two start to move away from Jaeger

JAEGER
Where you going

EPPS
Me and Wes are just going to talk

JAEGER
Why you got to move away to talk

EPPS
Were going to be right over here

JAEGER
Youre moving away because its going to
blow up isnt it Its going to blow
up

EPPS
I said be cool all right Now be cool

Epps and Wes move over and huddle

WES
What kind of mine

EPPS
I dont know and I wasnt about to mess
with it

WES

Should have blown already Delayed fuse
thats Vietnam stuff

EPPS

Maybe thats all the Iraqis could afford
okay Maybe they got it on discount
Maybe the fuse is messed up Or maybe
its going to go off in two seconds and
we wont have to worry about getting
Jaeger down off there all well have to
worry about is finding the pieces

Behind them pathetically Jaeger cries

JAEGER
Epps

WES
Doesnt matter Were not going to be
able to get him off it anyway

EPPS
Theres a way
JAEGER

Epps

WES
Cant do it Cant do it and keep him
alive

Epps eyes narrow He doesnt want to hear this kind of
talk

EPPS
I said nobody dies Nobody dies

JAEGER
Epps my leg is falling asleep

Epps thinks and thinks hard

EPPS
(To Wes)
Weve got rope

WES
For climbing

EPPS
Break it out

Epps crosses back over to Jaeger

JAEGER
My leg is falling asleep

EPPS
Its not falling asleep Youve only
been standing there for three minutes

JAEGER
Im the one who can feel my leg and its
falling asleep

EPPS
It falls asleep and you die so wake it
the hell up

Wes crosses over with climbing rope Very very gently Epps
wraps the middle of the rope around Jaegers waist leaving
several feet dangling off each end

JAEGER
Hows this going to work
EPPS
Me and Wes each going take an end of the

rope run our asses of and yank you off
the mine

JAEGER
Thats going to do it right Im going
to be okay

Not too convincingly

EPPS
Youre going to be fine

JAEGER
Youre not going to let me die are you
Dont let me die

Ignoring the question

EPPS
When we start running suck up your
breath Youre going to get the wind
knocked out of you

JAEGER
Dont let me die Epps I dont want to
die

Epps and Wes pick up separate ends of the rope and take up
positions behind Jaeger Epps waits a beat afraid of what
might happen but there is no choice He digs in ready to
take off running Wes whispers to him

WES
What if its a Valloro 69 Just going to
bounce right up out of the ground
explode in the air kill him and us

EPPS
You just go when I say go

WES
Should have at least gotten the map off
of him Blows up with him then we did
all this for nothing

Ignoring him

EPPS
Ready
Yeah
Epps takes a couple of deep breaths holds one

EPPS
Go

Wes and Epps are off the the races churning up sand as they
race away from Jaeger They scream like banshees as if to
draw strength

Jaeger does a little chant

JAEGER
Oh God Oh God

The rope goes taught Jaegers body jerks violently backward
as he gets the air punched out of him As his feet leave the
ground the mine detonates

CUT TO
POV - JAEGER
A fireball blossoms and eats up the air towards the camera
as THE CAMERA ITSELF RUSHES AWAY from the belching fire and
smoke

CUT TO
JAEGER
His feet just clear the outer edge of the fireball but still
get licked and burned by flames before he slams to the ground
several feet from the explosion

Epps runs to Jaeger Wes takes a casual stroll back over

JAEGER
Im all right Oh Jesus Im all right

All casual like Wes says

WES
The map okay

CUT TO

EXT DESERT - LATER
We see a set of three very odd tracks across the ground It
looks like something has been dragged through the sand THE
CAMERA FOLLOWS THE TRACKS TO EPPS WES AND JAEGER who crawl
on their bellies They thrust knifes into the sand before
them searching for mines We get the feeling theyve been at
this for awhile

WES
How long we going to keep this up

JAEGER
Until were out of the mine field is how
long

WES

Havent found a mine for half a mile or more

JAEGER
That dont mean nothing Iraqis could
have just spread them out like that make
us think were in the clear

WES
You want to crawl crawl

Wes stands and starts to walk Epps waits a beat and follows
suit Only Jaeger stays down

JAEGER
Youre going to blow yourselves up

EPPS
Wes is right If there were any more
mines we would have found them Hell
that one you stepped on was probably old
anyway left over from the war with Iran

JAEGER
You dont know that It could be a trick

EPPS
If we step on a mine well know it was
Let me see the maps

Jaeger stays down afraid to get up

EPPS (CONT)
Get up and give me the maps

After a beat Jaeger stands and hands over the map from the
puzzle box and a recon photo Epps compares the two then
takes out the navicom
EPPS (CONT)
Were on course Northeast twenty-eight
degrees When we hit the base of the
mountain well find a pass I can see it
on the recon photo Shouldnt be too
hard to traverse Thatll take us to the
top and

Epps points at a black dot on the puzzle box map with a
smaller white dot in the middle

EPPS
This Whatever it is

JAEGER
Its the treasure thats what it is

WES
It better be

Epps starts to pack away the map Real plain Jaeger says

JAEGER
The map

Epps stops like he almost not sure what Jaeger is talking
about Jaeger extends a hand

JAEGER (CONT)
The map

Epps gets it He hands the map back to Jaeger who tucks it
away Our boys walk on

EPPS
Youre not losing trust are you

JAEGER
Just figure its my map I ought to hang
on to it

WES

If all we wanted was the map out of you
we could have taken it while you were
standing on that mine pissing on
yourself

JAEGER
Probably wouldve too if Epps wasnt
around to stop you
EPPS
I didnt have to stop anything cause
nobody was going to do nothing Were in
this together understand

JAEGER
Yeah I understand Wes doesnt want to
come along in the first place but he
gets a third of the find Thats a sweet

deal

WES
Im getting tired of you riding me
Jaeger

JAEGER
Anytime you want to do something about it
just let--

Epps stops dead in his tracks

EPPS
Quiet

They all go quiet Epps cocks an ear to the air and listens
They all listen Wind but thats about it

JAEGER
I dont hear any--

EPPS
Shut up and listen

Again they listen Again they hear wind Then there it is
the sound Epps is looking for A pop like a big balloon
being burst just over the next rise

WES
Gunfire

Quick like that Jaeger grabs his M-16 down off his shoulder
and is about to ready it when Epps slaps down the muzzle

EPPS
Dont

JAEGER
Its a fire fight

EPPS
Single shots doesnt mean a fire fight
Thats not a battle going on
WES
What is it

Epps thinks Yeah what the hell is it
CuT TO
EXT DESERT - RISE

Epps Jaeger and Wes edge carefully up to the lip of the

rise on their bellies Theyre barely visible against the
sand Epps takes out a pair of binoculars and zeros in on
the ground below

CuT TO
POV - EPPS

THROUGH BINOCULAR LENSES we see a SHIITE CAMP A tent city
really There are several uniformed IRAQI SOLDIERS who are
roughing up the Shiite men

CuT TO
EPPS WES JAEGER

JAEGER
What is it

Epps hands the binoculars over to Jaeger Who looks down at
the scene on the ground

EPPS
Iraqis A bunch of them

JAEGER
What are they doing here

Jaeger hands the binoculars to Wes

EPPS
Well its Iraq Im not sure but Im
guessing that has something to do with
them being here

JAEGER
What are they doing in the middle of
nowhere

WES

Maybe theyre looking for gold
POV - WES

AGAIN WE SEE THROUGH THE BINOCULAR LENSES
soldiers is pushing around a Shiite
then casual as rain pulls out a gun and gives hima

about it

bullet gift wrapped straight to the brain

EPPS WES

JAEGER

JAEGER
Jesus What the hell did he do that for
Theyre Iraqis Why are Iraqis killing
raqis

WES
hose people down there are Shiites
Youve got Shiites in the south of Iraq
and Khurds in the North Neither of
themve got much love for Saddam
Pp

robably figured once the war started

EPPS

JAEGER

-

WES

JAEGER

EPPS
All right Lets get out of here

WES
The soldiers are going to kill those
people

JAEGER
So

is soldiers out to slap them around some

CUT TO

One of the Iraqi
having a good laugh

CUT TO
We have to do something

EPPS
Theres nothing we can do

WES
We can fight Thats what were here
for To fight the Iraqis To help the
Shiites and the Khurds

JAGER
I didnt sign up to help any Shiites
All we were supposed to do is get the
Iraqis out of Kuwait and if we arent
doing that then all bets are off

EPPS
We carrying any ordinance

WES
Some extra grenades A Claymore

Epps thinks then shakes his head

EPPS
Not enough Were out numbered and out
gunned Theyd cut us to shreds

JAEGER
So good bye Shiites Thanks for
playing We have some lovely parting
gifts for you as you go

WES
Were American soldiers We dont
abandon people

JAEGER
Funny you should say that while were out
looking for gold

WES
Youre the one wanted to kill Iraqis so
bad

JAEGER

Ive got a new agenda now its get rich
The only way the Iraqis figure into that
is not at all

EPPS
(To Wes)
I dont want to see people killed any
more than you But we try to help out we
die and all we do is die

WES
We cant just go off and--

EPPS
Theres nothing we can do We shouldnt
even be here in the first place

Theres a big loud quiet as our boys just hang there From
down below comes another balloon burst another gun shot

Epps lowers his head He wants to fight but its like he

said Theres nothing they can do Epps slides back away

from the rise then Jaeger and finally Wes disappears back
the way they came

CUT TO
EXT DESERTMOUNTAINS - LATER
Its the kind of red rock and mesas one would expect to find
in a desert not too steep or rough but it looks as though
they will definitely takes more than a little physical

exertion to navigate

Epps Wes and Jaeger approach a path at the mesas base
Jaeger takes out his maps and looks them over

JAEGER
This is it Were right on target

Epps takes a long gander up towards the top of the mesa

EPPS
All weve got to do is make it to the
top

WES

And find the treasure and get it and
get back to the Humvee and get the hell
out of Iraqi without getting our heads
blown off but thats about it

EPPS
Were not going to find anything standing
here Lets get to climbing

They ready their packs and weapons then start up the mesa
FADE TO

Our boys trekking along the pass They push onward and
upward

FADE TO

The pass has narrowed and become more treacherous The
rocks are loose and the footing unsure The going has slowed
considerably as each man must be extremely careful of their
steps

FADE TO

Our boys stop The pass has seemingly came to an end Fora
short ways the face of the mesa is almost sheer The three
soldiers take it in

EPPS
Not much of a pass

WES
Probably was a couple of hundred years
ago when whoever drew the map came
through here Worn down to nothing now

EPPS
Picks up again just on the other side

They all take a good look at what little there is to cross
on and how far down it is to the hard jagged rocks below

JAEGER
Think we can make it

WES
We make it or we go back empty handed

EPPS
Looks like we make it

Epps and Wes edge their way towards whats left of the pass
Jaeger just stands there staring down Way down

FADE TO

Epps Wes and Jaeger inch along the pass hugging the face of
the mesa Small rocks churn beneath their feet and tumble to
the ground below No man says a word theyre too busy
trying to keep alive and the air is filled with the sounds
of labored breathing
Each step so very careful Testing the pass for purchase
making sure the footing is solid They inch one foot
forward then slide over the next Their hands probe the
cliff face fingers crawling like spider legs looking for
something anything to take hold of

Sweat drips into Epps eye He blinks hard and fast trying to
clear his vision Right now he cant really afford
distractions

Slowly carefully inch by inch the little death dance goes
on

Jaeger steps He steps wrong The pass gives way under his
foot and begins to slide down Instinctively Wes rockets out
an arm grabbing Jaeger by the uniform At first Jaeger
smiles glad for the save But then he realizes something
Wes is literally holding his life in his hands All Wes has
to do is loosen his grip and

The color drains from Jaegers face Wes stares back blank
as a bowl of water

Eternity goes on for a second

Finally Wes yanks Jaeger back up against the mesas face
then slides on Jaeger just hangs where he is for a beat
clutching the rocks for dear life

FADE TO

Epps makes it to the far side of the broken pass He holds
out a hand to Wes and reels him in Together they both help
bring in Jaeger Wes looks back over the path theyve just
crossed

WES
The US Army Always an adventure

EPPS
Let me see the map

Jaeger hands the map to Epps who gives it a going over THEY
WALK AS THEY TALK

EPPS (CONT)
Should be easy going from here Stay on
the pass straight to the dot

WES
What do you figure it to be
EPPS
Got to be some kind of landmark
something distinctive

JAEGER
X marks the spot

EPPS
Something like that

JAEGER
But the white dot in the middle thats
got to mean something

EPPS
I hope it means something otherwise

WES
Otherwise whatever were looking for
could be anywhere

EPPS
Basically But the map has been pretty
precise so far I dont think itll be
too hard to--

Our boys step past a grouping of rocks They stop dead
Sitting before them in what looks like a small camp is FIVE
IRAQI SOLDIERS Time clicks by real slow for an instant
Its a delayed reaction like the beat it takes after you
pick up a hot pan before you realize that yeah it is
burning the flesh from your hand

EPPS (CONT)
Take cover

Our three soldiers turn and bolt back the way they came

They run like wild rabbits for a bit jumping over a rock
formation and hitting the deck using the rocks as cover

Like well-trained warriors they peel their weapons from their
shoulders lock and load and stand ready They wait a bit
taking several deep breaths like divers about to go under
Finally Epps gives the order

EPPS (CONT)
Lets hit ‘em
Simultaneously they spring up from behind the rocks and bear
down on the Iraqis with their M-16s ready to blow them to

kingdom come

One problem No Iraqis
For a beat our three dont move They hold position breath
coming hard like sprinters at the end of a race Theyre
eyes flint back and forth scanning for somethinganything
Theres nothing

EPPS (CONT)
Cover me

M-16 still at the ready Epps raises up taking a tactical
stance He inches forward sweeping his weapon back and
forth before him for any potential target There is none
The Iraqis have vanished Epps lowers the M-16 but does not
shoulder it

EPPS (CONT)
Clear

Wes and Jaeger come up from their cover and cross to Epps
They keep their weapons ready Eerily they all look around
as if trying to spot ghosts

WES
Whered they go

EPPS
I dont know Theres a lot of space up
here They could be just about--

WES
Weird they didnt chase us

JAEGER
Maybe theyre as scared of us as we are
of them

WES

Just seems weird they didnt chase us

EPPS
Whats weird is how they disappeared
Doesnt make sense Doesnt

There is a sound a steady swooshing that starts faint and
grows closer like a rolling thunder Our three start looking
around turning where they stand trying to find the source
of the sound as it rises to a near deafening pitch Theres
nothing They see nothing Still the sound races closer and
closer Epps Jaeger and Wes raise up their weapons in
preparation to defend themselves against this unseen beast

From below the edge of the mesa a HELICOPTER GUNSHIP -
probably a MIL MI-24 HIND-D ARMED ASSAULT HELICOPTER if you
want to be technical - raises up very dramatically into
sight It hangs in the air ominously before our soldiers

On board are the vanished Iraqis wearing nasty grins The
PILOT brings the gunship about and levels her massive machine
cannons at our boys

EPPS (CONT)
Scatter

Wes and Jaeger dont have to be told twice They bolt from
their spots and not an instant too soon The GUNNER lets
fly a barrage of shells that literally tear up the ground
where our boys were just standing We see what the chopters
weapons will do to rock We can imagine what they would do
to flesh

Epps Jaeger and Wes take cover behind some rocks The
gunship swings around picks up speed and bears down on them

More shells fired They punch into and through the rocks our
boys use for cover Again the three scatter and just in
time as the shells rip their way through the rock

Our three go sliding down an embankment crouching low
Their heads whip around looking for the gunship

JAEGER
Where is it Whered it go

EPPS
Stay low

JAEGER
Where the hell is it

EPPS
Just stay down

In answer to Jaegers question the gunship comes swooping up
behind them like a bird of prey Our three have all of about
a second to get running before the Iraqis send more shells
their way They kick up chunks of rock as they ping ping
ping around Epps Wes and Jaeger who make a wild evasive
run

Dig it Up ahead is a narrow passage through rock face
They race for it hurl themselves into it as the gunship
sends a special delivery of white-hot metal their way

Once inside the passage they have a bit of breathing space
Its too narrow for the gunship to get a good shot through
Our three press themselves up against the rock walls and suck
air

Beyond the opening to the passage the gunship swings back and
forth like a junkyard dog patrolling its kingdom

Jaegers worked up a real scare

JAEGER
What are we going to do What the hell
are we going to do

EPPS
Were not going to do anything

JAEGER
(Panicked)
Theyre going to kill us

EPPS
They cant shoot us in here

WES
And they cant fly around out there
forever

EPPS

So we wait

JAEGER
If they land--

EPPS
If they land we can take them If they
dont land then weve got nothing to
worry about

Wes watches the gunship as it seemingly settles in the air

It floats very steady as if Wes eyes key in on
something The gunships missile pods rotating slightly
coming in line Wes eyes go wide like someone just jammed

an electric cattle prod in his ass

WES
Missile

EPPS
Move

Epps Wes and Jaeger sprint for the opening at the far end of
the passage as a missile rockets from the gunships pod
With a wild whine it rides the wind like a deadly arrow
straight into the passage Slamming into the ground it
sprouts a terrific fireball that rides on a massive
explosion It races through the passage lifts our boys from
the ground and tosses them out into the open like they were
nothing more than discarded ragdolls

Jaeger takes cover and cowers He puts his panic into
overdrive

Wes pulls his rifle Grunting like an animal he sprays
bullets at the chopter but its like throwing snowballs at
an elephant The gunship turns on Wes and fires in his
direction It doesnt hit him but it sends him running

Epps has had enough of this shit He scrambles to load a
grenade in his launcher as the gunship comes about It races
for him cannons at the ready This one is going to be
close Epps locks and loads just as the chopter swings down
on him Epps fires but the gunship simply jukes up and away
from the grenade the way someone might step over a bug The
grenade impacts the rock face behind the chopter exploding
harmlessly The chopter returns the favor by reining down a
hail of shells that kicks Epps back FLIPPING HIM UP AND OVER
the edge of the plateau His M-16 goes flying smashing into
the ground far below Epps manages to grab hold of the
plateau lip with one hand It swings him around slamming
him hard against the cliff face He hangs there suspended by
his weakening grip far above the ground

JAEGER
Epps

Jaeger and Wes run to him grabbing him by his arm They
pull and pull hard until Epps can get some kind of purchase
and crawl his way back up to the plateau

At the same time the gunship lowers itself so that it hovers
above and beyond our three It rotates so that the bay doors
are facing Epps Wes and Jaeger Three Iraqis are inside
weapons trained on our targets One of them yells something
Wes translates

WES
They want us to surrender

The three share a nervous look Epps fairly growls

EPPS
Yeah Ill surrender

Jaeger and Wes watch as shielded by their bodies Epps palms
a grenade from his belt Wes and Jaeger dont quite smile
but they know now they at least have a chance As Epps
stands the other two turn to face the Iraqis They all fold
their hands behind their necks which for Epps hides the
renade from view Slowly they walk towards the gunship

ne of the Iraqis starts to yell something He lifts his
eapon and aims it at our boys With his thumb Epps yanks
he pin from the grenade and lets fly Its a perfect toss
anding in the chopters bay The Iraqis see the grenade
and they scramble for it One of them grabs it up and is
bout to throw it back out of the gunship

MrrEtzOoOUW

Too late

The grenade explodes in the Iraqis hand killing him
instantly It also touches off a fire ball that severely
damages the gunship It rocks lists spins wildly out of
control

EPPS (CONT)
Get down

Our three hug the ground as the chopters rotors go whipping
through the air like throwing knifes landing perilously among
them Worse still the gunship now a lame bird drops from
the sky towards Epps Jaeger and Wes All they can do is
cover their heads as if that would do any good against two
tons of crashing steel The chopter rushes downdown but
it just misses them It slams into the ground skipping over
the edge of the plateau to the rocks below

Our three pick themselves up They walk to the edge of the
plateau and look down on the crash

Jaeger scared painted all over his face sinks to his knees
and looks as if hes about to go into shock

JAEGER
Oh God

Wes looks down at Jaeger with a bit of a disdainful sneer
WES
Yeah Just keeps getting better and
better doesnt it
They stare for awhile then one by one move off Us We
FADE TO

BLACK

FADE TO
EXT DESERTMESA - LATER

Epps Wes and Jaeger trek to a large crevice that runs
straight down into the ground Jaeger takes out his maps and
photos Epps consults the navicom

WES
What do you think

JAEGER
Lines up with the map and the photos

EPPS
Were right where we should be

Epps tucks the navicom away on his belt and takes a look
around Not much to see

EPPS (CONT)
I sure dont see much place else around
here to hide anything

Wes pulls a lanternflashlight from his pack Going to his
belly he shines it down into the crevice

WES
Cant see anything

He tosses a rock into it We can hear it hit the ground below

WES (CONT)
Its got a bottom

JAEGER
Guess we know what the next stop is

EPPS
All right Lets break out some utility
shovels lanterns and a claymore in case
we have to do any blasting Me and
Jaegerll climb down and see what we can
see

WES
What am I supposed to do

EPPS
Got to have someone here in case we need
help making it back up Doesnt hurt to
have a look out either
JAEGER
Think there might be more Iraqis

EPPS
Right now I wouldnt be surprised if
Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The
Clowns

CUT TO

WE SEE A FEW QUICK SHOTS of Wes securing a line down into the
crevice Epps and Jaeger clipping on rapeling harnesses the
two men lowering themselves down into the great unknown

CUT TO
INT CREVICES - CONTINUOUS

The lantern punches a hole through the darkness as Epps uses
it like a machete to blaze a trial He sinks downdown
until finally they touch bottom He unclips himself from the
rope and Jaeger starts down

The space isnt that big like a small cave really Its
tight enough that the lantern pretty well lights up the whole
of it But its big enough that one wouldnt have any idea
where to start digging

Jaeger makes it to the bottom Wes yells down

WES
You down

JAEGER
Yeah were down

WES
What do you see

EPPS
Nothing

More to himself

EPPS (CONT)
A whole lot of nothing

JAEGER
So where do we start

Epps takes a look around then shrugs
EPPS
Wherever you want

Epps breaks out his utility shovel from his pack Jaeger
follows suit He looks around picks a spot and starts
digging

FADE TO
WES - LATER
He sits up top weapon in hand standing guard

FADE TO

EPPS AND JAEGER - LATER

They dig furiously at sperate ends of the cave They dig
with a determination to find something

FADE TO
WES - LATER

Still up top hes given up on standing guard Now he
stretches out on the ground sunning himself

FADE TO

EPPS AND JAEGER

Their shirts are off and theyre caked with sweat and dirt
They look like theyve been digging for quite some time

They certainly dont have the same enthusiasm they displayed
previously Now they just seem to dig by rote

FADE TO
WES - LATER

The sun has begun to sink noticeably Wes leans over the
crevice

WES
HeyHey Suns going down Epps
Jaeger Its getting dark up here
CUT TO

EPPS AND JAEGER - SIMULTANEOUS
Its obvious these guys have been digging for hours and come

up with nothing Epps keeps digging but just barely

Jaeger doesnt even bother anymore He just sits on the

ground sulking

WES (OC)
Epps

EPPS
I heard

WES
He rolls over and scoffs

WES
Theres nothing down there

EPPS AND JAEGER
Epps notices Jaeger just sitting there

EPPS
What are you doing

JAEGER
What does it look like Im doing

EPPS
It looks like youre not doing anything

JAEGER
Im not And Im not doing anything
because theres nothing down here

EPPS
Get up and dig

JAEGER
Weve been digging Weve been digging
for hours If there was anything here to

find we would have found it

EPPS
Get up off your ass and dig

Sounding defeated as all hell and very whiney

CUT TO

CUT TO
JAEGER
Whats the point Theres nothing here
The maps a fake Christ even I see
that now Were just wasting our time
We might as well give up and--

Epps spins Like a bolt of lightning hes on Jaeger
grabbing him up and pulling him close

EPPS
You listen to me The whole reason were
here is because of you and that map of
yours I didnt do all this for nothing
and Im not leaving with nothing If you
think for a second Im giving up just
cause youre too tired to turn over some
dirt then you dont know John Epps too
well do you So you dig and you keep
on digging til I say you dont have to
dig anymore

Epps pushes Jaeger back and he goes down to the ground hard
A fire burns inside him A fire that burns out of control
Before he even knows what hes doing Jaeger springs to his
feet shovel in hand bringing it down in a long arc for
Epps head

Epps bears him coming He deftly side steps the blow grabs
hold of Jaeger and forces him down They roll around
violently like wild dogs trading blows and trying to work the
other into a choke hold

CUT TO
WES
He can hear the sounds of the struggle and yells down
WES
What are you doing What the hell are
you doing down there
CUT TO

EPPS AND JAEGER

They fight on down and dirty Locked together they roll
around the ground each trying to get the upper hand They
smash into the lantern sending the cave into near darkness
At the same time Epps works himself on top of Jaeger He
lands a couple of solid punches takes a rock from the ground
and lifts it high ready to send it crashing into Jaegers
skull All Jaeger can do is steel himself for the deathblow

Something catches Epps eye A glint of light flashes across
his faces He stares at it at an opening a bare seem
really in the side of the cave wall where light seeps
through The rock slips from his hand Forgetting all about
Jaeger Epps goes to the opening Jaeger himself as if what
just happened hadnt really happened comes up along side

Epps

JAEGER
Must be a compartment

EPPS
I feel air Probably opens up outside
somewhere Thats where the light comes
from Couldnt see it with the lanternon

Jaeger says what they both must have guessed by now

JAEGER
The white dot light in the dark

Thats all Epps needs to hear He starts clawing at the
opening with his bare hands That gets him nothing

Grabbing up a shovel he starts to whack at it Jaeger gets
the lantern working again then picks up his shovel and joins
in They keep hitting and hitting picking up a rhythm like
a southern chain gang

JAEGER (CONT)
Maybe we should blast it loose with the
claymore

EPPS
Its giving

The rock gives way enough for Epps to pry it free Theres
just enough space for a man to reach his arm through For a
beat Epps and Jaeger just stare at the opening almost afraid
of what mayor may not be in there

With some trepidation Epps begins to move his hand towards
the opening Slowly it extends closercloser Just as
it moves beyond the opening vThere is a wild screeching
hiss as some small hairy thing leaps for Epps

Both Epps and Jaeger recoil Jaeger going nuts with fear

JAEGER
Jesus Christ
Jaeger grabs up his M-16 and takes aim atwhatever it is

EPPS
No dont shoot

Too late Jaeger squeezes off a few rounds A couple of
bullets hit the thing but the rest ricochet wildly about the
cave and around Epps and Jaeger All the two men can do is
duck and cover - squeezing themselves into tight fetal balls
- as the bullets scream back and forth like little chunks of
random death

Eventually the bullets lose speed and die off Jaeger and
Epps raise up off the ground They walk to the dead thing
that jumped from the opening

EPPS
Its just a mongoose

JAEGER
Is it dead

EPPS
Yeah Bwana you got it

CUT TO
WES
Yelling down

WES
What the hell are you doing

CuT TO
EPPS AND JAEGER

JAEGER
I think we found something

They go back to the opening Epps shines a light inside to
make sure there are no more surprises then reaches an arm
in Jaeger looks on with great anticipation licking his
lips like a hungry jackal as Epps twists his arm in the
opening Searchingsearching

Epps face freezes He goes perfectly still for a beat then
slowly draws his hand from the opening It clutches a wooden
box It is similar to Jaegers puzzle box but slightly
bigger The instant Epps sets the box on the ground Jaeger
smashes his shovel into it shattering the ancient wood From

the splinters pours a river of gold coins

Jaeger and Epps

are too stunned to do anything but look at it

WES
He leans over the crevice

WES
What is it Whatd you find

EPPS AND JAEGER
Incredulous himself

EPPS
Gold Its gold

Jaeger yells it at the top of his lungs

JAEGER
ITS GOLD

WES

CUT TO

CUT TO

CUT TO

His lips flutter a bit before they land on the word

WES
Gold

EPPS AND JAEGER

CUT TO

They scoop up handfuls of the coins and let them run through

their fingers

JAEGER

Its not like I figured Its cold And

its heavier than I imagined

EPPS

I wouldnt know I never imagined this
Not in my whole life did I ever imagine

this

JAEGER
You dont have to imagine it Not
anymore Now all youve got to think up
is what its going to buy you

Epps grabs up one coin and stands

EPPS
Wes

With all his strength Epps gives the coin an underhanded toss
straight up

CUT TO
WES

Wes catches the coin He turns it over in his fingers He
smiles and theres nothing pleasant about it

CUT TO
JAEGER AND EPPS
Epps yells up

EPPS
Wes thrown down a pack

A beat later an empty pack comes falling down Epps picks it
up and takes it over to Jaeger The two of them start
loading the coins into it

EPPS (CONT)
I dont think the line will take the
weight of a man and the coins
(Yelling up)
Wes Well send the gold up then me
and Jaeger1ll climb back

WES (0C)
Ready when you are

Epps is just about to attach the pack of gold to the line
when Jaeger grabs his arm

JAEGER
Wait

EPPS
What

Jaeger isnt sure how to say what hes thinking
EPPS (CONT)
What

JAEGER
We send the gold up whats to stop him
from taking off and leaving us down here

EPPS
Hes not going to leave us

JAEGER
Whats to stop him if he wanted to All
he has to do is cut the line

Good point What is to stop him

WES
You ready

EPPS
(To Jaeger)
All right Ill go up then you send up
the gold and--

JAEGER
Why do I have to stay down here

EPPS
Jesus Jaeger

JAEGER
I dont see how that plans any better

EPPS
Someones got to send the gold up It
cant get on the line by itself

JAGER
Whys it got to be me

A tense moment passes

WES
What are you doing You ready

Another moment then
EPPS

All right You go up Ill send up the
gold then follow
JAEGER
Yeah Yeah thatll work

Jaeger goes over to the line and hooks himself on Hes just
about ready to climb up when Epps stops him Serious as a
heart attack he says

EPPS
If youre even thinking about leaving me
down here you better think again

Jaeger stares at Epps for a beat then laughs himself a
little laugh He yells up

JAEGER
Wes Im coming up

Jaeger starts to climb as Wes helps out by pulling on the
rope

Epps watches him for a bit then looks at the pack of gold
and the rest of the equipment Suddenly he scurries about
gathering up all the things theyve brought down

Jaeger continues his climb disappearing up into the crevice
A few beats later the rope comes snaking back down from
above Epps brings over the pack of gold and attaches it to
the rope Yelling up

EPPS
Okay

The rope goes taught slowly drawing the pack up up into the
crevice finally to be swallowed from view

Epps waits for the rope to come back down He waits He
waits a beat more No rope

EPPS (CONT)
Wes Jaeger

He tries to keep the apprehension from his voice but it
creeps in anyway He tries it again

EPPS (CONT)
Jaeger

Still more nothing Whats that sound Its Epps breath
getting heavier and faster

EPPS (CONT)
Jaeger
Nothing Then something The rope snakes its way back down
Epps cant help but let go of a little laugh like a guy
whos just been given a scare by his own shadow Taking up
his own pack Epps hooks up then starts the climb to the top

CuT TO
JAEGER AND WES

They work the rope helping Epps up He gets to the lip of
the crevice and pulls himself over Hes breathing hard

and lets his pack slide to the ground Trying not to sound
too rattled

EPPS
What the hell took so long

JAEGER
Just had to get the pack unhooked from
the line It didnt seem that long

EPPS
Not when youre up here with the gold I
guess not

Throwing Epps own words back at him

WES
Not losing trust are you

Epps lets this go

EPPS
Itll be too dark to make our way back
now Lets bed down for the night and
head out at first light

WES
What about the gold

EPPS
What about it

WES
Maybe we should split it up now

EPPS
We started this together and were
staying together so theres no point in
splitting things up now
WES
What if we get separated Way I see it
if something happens I want to be
carrying my share

JAEGER
Wes might be right about that

EPPS
It stays as it is Were halfway home
now Lets not blow it by people getting
ideas

WES
Youre the one with all the ideas

EPPS
Youve had your say Wes Now leave it

WES
Maybe youve got ideas of your own for
the gold Maybe youve already got
things worked out

EPPS
Maybe do

WES
Maybe dont need your ideas Maybe I
can do better on my own

Epps sees trouble coming and deals with it the only way he
knows how Casually he turns from Wes as if hes about to
let things go Suddenly he spins back around throwing a
punch to Wes jaw that sends him to the ground

Wes puts a hand to his mouth It comes back stained red
Wes goes on the boil

WES (CONT)
You got no reason to do that

EPPS
I told you When I straighten someone
out they stay straightened This is how
it works Nobody touches the gold
Except when were on the move and
someones carrying it nobody so much as
opens the pack to get an eyeful of it
Agreed

Jaeger wastes no time jumping in
JAEGER
Yeah Sure That sounds like a plan to
me

Wes still on the ground fumes

WES
You got no reason to hit me Im getting
tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around

EPPS
Then get up and do something about it

Wes thinks about it but thats all he does Hes not ready
to cross that line yet

EPPS (CONT)
Then just lay there and bleed

Epps takes up his pack and moves off to bed down Jaeger
does the same Wes just lays on the groundand bleeds

FADE TO
BLACK

FADE TO
EXT MESA - EARLY MORNING

The first light of day barely begins to fight its way through
the dark Our boys sleep in a circle around the pack filled
with gold Surprisingly they seem to sleep pretty well but
then the last twenty-four hours has taken a lot out of them

There is a slight sound Rocks crunching underneath a foot
Someone stirs someone moves Its hard to tell who it is in
this bad light They creep towards the pack inching their
way closer and closer They reach out a hand just about to
grab the pack

Wes who obviously wasnt asleep at all lunges for the
person and takes them down hard Theres the ugly crunch of
body against stone as they hit the ground M-16 in hand Wes
straddles the intruder pressing the muzzle of the rifle
against his head

WES
Stay down Stay the hell down or I will
rip your stinking head off
Underneath him an IRAQI SOLDIER - who already looks very
badly injured bloody cut slightly burned - babbles back in
high pitched and frightened Arabic

This is enough to wake Jaeger and Epps

JAGER
What the hell

WES
I caught him I caught him trying to
steal the gold

EPPS
Get off him

WES
(Slightly crazed)
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep
only I wasnt sleeping Would have slit
our throats if I hadnt stopped him

EPPS
Get off him

Epps reaches down and physically pulls Wes from the soldier
who still rattles on

EPPS (CONT)
What happened

WES
I told you He tried to steal our gold
He tried to kill us

JAEGER
With what He doesnt have a weapon

WES
Hes a soldier He doesnt need a
weapon Hes got rocks Hes got bare

hands

The soldier goes on babbling Wes has had just about enough
of that He gives the soldier a kick to the ribs

WES (CONT)
Shut up

Epps gives Wes a hard push

EPPS
Stop it

WES
I told you dont push me around

Even now frightened but more calmly the soldier goes on

EPPS
Tell me what hes saying

Wes listens but with disdain He translates

WES
Says hes one of the soldiers that was in
the helicopter

JAEGER
He lived through that

The soldier goes on and so does Wes

WES
Says they were deserters they were
afraid to fight dont believe in Saddam
anyway They flew the gunship up here to
hide out When they saw us they figured
we were going to kill them so they shot
first

EPPS
Whyd he come in our camp

Wes asks him the question in Arabic and gets an answer

enough to give Wes a bit of a laugh

WES
Says he wanted food Liar He wanted
the gold

EPPS

Hows he going to want the gold He
couldnt even know we had it

WES
Hehe could have been watching us

JAEGER
Maybe we should give him some water

WES
All last night he could have been--

Its
JAEGER
I think he wants something to drink

WES
Im not wasting my water on him

Jaeger gets his water and gives some to the soldier

WES (CONT)
I dont care what he says he wanted our
gold Would have slit our throats if he
had the chance

EPPS
Doesnt matter Whatever he wanted he
didnt get it Weve got no need staying
around here Its light enough Lets
pack up and head out

Jaeger and Epps start to go for their gear Wes is still on
the Iraqi soldier

WES
What about him Wewe have to do
something

Epps gives an expression that screams What the hell are you
talking about

WES (CONT)
We cant just leave him Hell run back
to his outfit report our position

EPPS
You said he was a deserter

WES
Thats what he says He could be a spy
or something

EPPS
You dont know that

WES
You dont know he isnt

JAEGER
So well take him with us At least til
we get back to the Hummer

WES
Hed just slow us down and drink our
water And if we ran into any more
Iraqis you know hed sell us out

EPPS
We dont leave him we dont take him
with us What does that leave

By way of answering Wes lifts his M-16 and works the action

EPPS (CONT)
Youre out of your mind

WES
Hes an enemy soldier

EPPS
Im not going to let you kill him

WES
Were at war

The discussion starts to get real heated

EPPS
We are not at war You and I and Jaeger
are AWOL We have no authority--

WES
He tried to kill us If not just now
then in the helicopter Thats all the
authority I need

Jaeger goes somewhere near panic

JAEGER
We dont need to do this We got the
gold all right Lets just get out of
here

The Iraqi may not speak the language but hes got a pretty
good idea what they are arguing about He starts to plead
for his life

WES
Im not going to leave him be just so he
can stab us in the backs the minute we
turn around I have been through too
much to lose it all now just because the
two of you dont have the stomach to do
what has to be done

EPPS
ve got no stomach for murder

WES
ts a combat action

EPPS
ts murder and I wont be any part of
it

WES

fq

Then step aside

EPPS
No

WES
Get out of my way

The Iraqis begging goes into over drive Jaeger just about
loses it

JAEGER
For Christs sake we dont need this
Lets just go Lets justlets just
get out of here

Wes yells down at the Iraqi

WES
Shut up Shut the hell up

Wes moves menacingly for the Iraqi He thrusts his M-16
forward Epps grabs it and throws a punch Unlike before
with Jaeger this time Wes ducks the blow and swings the butt
of the M-16 back at Epps Its not much of a blow though
and Epps keeps on coming He barrels into Wes and takes him
down

As the two men tussle the Iraqi sees his chance to get away
He springs up knocking Jaeger to the side and bolts past
him

JAGER
Hes getting away

Epps turns and sees this Maybe hes not for killing this
guy but he certainly cant just let him get away He takes
off running after the Iraqi Jaeger a step behind

The Iraqi face flush with fear eyes filled with terror like
a hunted animal makes it to the rock face and starts to
climb to the plateau above He knows if he can make it he at
least has a chance of getting away It shows in the
desperation he climbs with

Epps and Jaeger are right behind him They claw at the
rocks but cant gain ground

The Iraqi gets closer and closer to the plateau to freedom
Our two soldiers scramble up right behind him

The Iraqi gets a hand on the lip of the plateau Hes just
about to pull himself up Hes just about to get away--

WE HEAR A SHORT BURST OF GUNFIRE Three large bloody holes
mushroom open in the Iraqis back

CUT TO
WES

He stands smoke curling from the muzzle of his M-16 like a
white snake having just send the Iraqi some bullets special
delivery

CUT TO
THE IRAQI

He arches stiffens then falls like a stone past Epps and
Jaeger to the ground below like a sack of potatoes

As the two climb down Wes goes to the body and stands over it
like the great white hunter standing over his kill All
business like he says

WES
I had to You saw how he ran Would
have given us away I had to

Theres a beat of quiet then

JAEGER
Maybe we ought toyou know bury him
Say some words over him

WES
You want to say some words

He sneers down at the body

WES (CONT)
Go to hell How are those words
Wes moves off A beat later Jaeger walks away Epps just
stands there looking at the body

EXT MESA - LATER

Wes Epps and Jaeger are making the trek back down

is shouldering the pack with the gold

Epps stops

CUT TO

Jaeger

Wes has got his M-16

and puts his pack down He takes out the navicom
and a recon photo

EPPS
We should head Northeast

JAEGER
Northeast Thats away from the Hummer
further into Iraqi

EPPS
Theres another pass on the photo We
can avoid that narrow one we had to cross
on the way up and it should get us back
down

JAEGER
It should or it will Least going back
the way we came we know what were up
against

EPPS
You think you can make that pass weighted
down when you almost fell the first time
youre wrong and youre not going to
take my share of the gold with you trying
it Were heading Northeast

Really calm cold and direct Wes says

WES
Youve got an awful lot of orders in you
Always giving orders

EPPS
I out rank you thats why

WES
In the service you do but were not
particularly in the service right now
Way I see it what were doing that
doesnt particularly give you the right
to toss orders around
Epps loads up his pack pretty much ignoring Wes

EPPS
We been down this road I told you how
it is Unless you feel like theres
something you want to do about it

WES
What if I do

Epps says nothing so Wes tries it again a little harder

WES (CONT)
What if I do

He works the action of his M-16

WES (CONT)
You talk loud and dont even have a big
stick to back it up with

Real casual Epps takes a grenade from his belt and flips the
pin loose He stands with the grenade in one hand and the
navicom in the other Real calm like he was talking about
the weather

EPPS
Something happens to me I let go of this
grenade I go and I take the navicom
with me And how do you suppose youre
going to find your way back to the Hummer
when you wont even know whats up or
down Its a big country and you could
be heading for the allies or wandering
right into Bhagdad Thats if you dont
die of thirst before you even get that
far How you like my stick now

Epps and Wes have a stare down Jaeger whos getting really
good at freaking out jumps in

JAEGER
Why dont you put the gun down all
right Wes You put the gun down and
Eppsll put the pin back in the grenade
Wont you Epps

The stare down goes on a beat longer Finally Wes lowers his
rifle He turns to Jaeger and vents what anger he can

WES
Im starting to think youre a real
bitch you know that

FADE TO
EXT DESERT - LATER

THE CAMERA PANS over the vast expanse of nothingness SMOKE
BEGINS TO DRIFT INTO FRAME THE CAMERA FINALLY LANDS ON THE
SHIITE ENCAMPMENT or at least whats left of it Tents are
torn down and burned goods scattered It looks like a ghost
town Epps Wes and Jaeger wander into it They look
around but see no signs of life

Wes grabs up some Shiite garments white robes and starts
to put them on

JAEGER
Youre going to burn up in those

WES
The white reflects the sun it keeps you
cooler Thats why they wear them

Jaeger looks to Epps who just shrugs Jaeger gets some robes
and puts them on Epps follows suit

JAEGER
Think the Iraqis killed them all

WES
Probably shot a few Scattered the rest
Murderers

EPPS
(Pointed)
Murder or a combat action Its hard to
tell them apart

They keep on moving passing straight through the camp Epps
marches ahead not wanting to even deal with the other two
men Wes talks after him Really he talks more to himself
and hes not sounding too lucid

WES

You saw how he ran didnt you First
chance he got he ran out Would have
gone straight to his CO told him all
about the gold What do you think would
have happened then huh Then what do
you think would have happened Two
thousand screaming Iraqis bearing down on
us You ought to thank me for killing
him Ill get a medal for it Watch and
see if I dont get a medal

Epps isnt even paying attention hes just walking on
Almost as if he senses something is wrong he stops in his
tracks He looks down at his feet and sees the most curious
thing SAND IS RUSHING AWAY FROM HIS FEET ALMOST AS IF ITS
GOING DOWN A DRAIN He looks at it with the same wonderment
that a dog watches television

EPPS
What the hell

Epps has got all of about two seconds to ponder this as a
moment later the Earth literally drops from beneath his feet
Hes standing on a sink hole that opens up swallowing him in
loose sand Immediately he sinks to waist level He slows
there but still goes down with rapidity He screams to
Jaeger and Wes

EPPS (CONT)
Help Help me

Jaeger drops the gold and runs to the edge of the hole Wes
doesnt move

EPPS (CONT)
Help me

Jaeger is paralyzed by indecision He doesnt want to let
Epps drown but if he gets too close he could easily get
sucked into He flirts back and forth between rescue and
safety

Sand continues to pour in on Epps

EPPS (CONT)
For Christs Sake Jaeger Help me
Help me

Jaeger cant fight himself any longer He lowers himself
halfway into the hole stretching spread eagle trying to keep
some kind of grip on the firmer ground and reaches for Epps

Their arms twist and strain for each others First their
fingers meet then they grab hands They work a grip down to
their wrist but thats all they can get Jaeger strains
like a field horse pulling Epps against the sand It may not
be enough as he begins to slip down himself Jaeger twists
his head and looks up at Wes Straining to say anything he
pleads
JAEGER
WesWes

His words fall on deaf ears Wes just takes a step closer to
the pack of gold coins

This only serves to energize Jaeger He digs deeper within
himself finding an untapped reserve of strength He grunts
and pulls the veins on his neck puffing like balloons

Epps finds same purchase He pulls swims his way up from
the sand A little at first but like hitting shallow water
hes able to lift himself up

Jager jerks him the rest of the way up to firm ground They
collapse chests heaving like pistons as they suck air

As Epps regains strength he pats himself down Suddenly he
goes back into a panic

EPPS
The navicom

Epps rolls back over and thrusts his hands down into the soft
sand frantically looking for the lost computer Jaeger joins
in They dig and scrape as best they can but daring to
venture only so far into the soft sand It doesnt matter
The navicom is lost

JAEGER
What are we going to do How are we
going to find our way back

EPPS
Well find our way

JAEGER
How

EPPS
Well find our way Well

Epps wants to say how but hes got no idea Wes grows a
smug smile

WES
No navicom A lot of good you are now
Epps

EPPS
Lot of good you were when I was sinking
in the sand

WES
Without that navicam looks to me like you
forfeit the right to be in charge

EPPS
And let me guess who is

Wes casually slides out his M-16

WES
Im the ones got the big stick

EPPS
Suppose I dont go for that

WES
Then I suppose itd be insurrection and
I suppose Id have to kill you
(Beat)
I suppose

EPPS
What about Jaeger

WES
Nothing about him unless hes got a
problem about me dealing with you

JAEGER
Yeah I got a problem with you killing Epps

Wes turns and glares at Jaeger who backs down

JAEGER (CONT
I mean in principle

WES
Sneering)
You know Jaeger you really are a bitch

Epps isnt wasting anymore time When Wes turns to glower at
Jaeger he lunges up for him Wes side steps Epps and lands
the but of his rifle into the side of Epps head It opens a
wound and sends Epps back down to the ground

Epps looks up right into the muzzle of West M-16 Full of
poison

WES (CONT)
You die
Wes is just about to squeeze back the trigger when a shot
rings out Wes body jerks like hes just been hit in the
back with a truck The way cut timber falls he slams to the
ground motionless

Epps and Jaeger stare at the body for a beat then snap their
heads in the direction of the shot

Up on a dune behind them are a group of SHIITES on
horseback One of them has a high powered rifle which he has
just used to drill Wes He fires another shot It pings to
the ground between Epps and Jaeger

Our two remaining men scramble Jaeger dives for the gold
and snatches it up from the ground as bullets zip around it
The two take off running as best they can in the sand They
run wildly erratically without looking back They run
until their bodies scream no more then keep going on
inertia Reaching a dune they tumble down the far side and
collapse in a heap at the bottom They take a moment to
catch what breath they can then

EPPS
We got to go back We got to go back for
Wes

JAEGER
Forget Wes

EPPS
We cant just leave him

JAEGER
Wes is dead

EPPS
What if hes not

JAEGER
Then he will be when those Iraqis get to
him He was going to kill you He was
one blink away from it Hes dead Epps
and Im sure as hell not getting my head
blow off over his carcass

They sit there trying to catch their breath As they doa
sound comes from the distance They freeze ears cocked
trying to figure out what it is

JAEGER (CONT)
Its a helicopter
Quickly desperately as the sound of the chopter draws
closer they scan the horizon looking for it Jaeger spots
it and thrusts a finger in its direction

JAGER (CONT)
There

Epps scrambles out his binoculars He targets the
helicopter Jaeger waits in high anticipation

JAEGER (CONT)
Ours or theirs

Epps cant make out for sure Jaeger asks again with growing
anxiety

JAEGER (CONT)
Ours or theirs

Epps takes a long hard stare

EPPS
Ours Its one of ours Weve got to
signal them let them know were down

here

The instant Jaeger hears this his face twists up like hes
thinking something and he doesnt like what it is hes
thinking Quietly almost to himself

JAEGER
No

EPPS
We need something A flare a signal
mirror

Again Jaeger says it this time including Epps too

JAEGER
No

EPPS
What do you mean no They can fly us home

JAEGER (CONT)
Theyll ask questions want to know why
we were out here

EPPS
Well lie
JAEGER
Theyll search the pack

Epps finds a mirror in one of his pockets

to signal the chopter

JAEGER (CONT)
Theyll find the gold

Epps turns sharply back to Jaeger

EPPS

Were lost you understand that

He stands ready

Weve

got no navicom and no means to finda
way back So right now I dont give a
damn about the gold because if we dont
get off this desert and out of Iraqi all
its going to be good for is buying us

tombstones

Epps is back around ready to signal the helicopter Hes
about to raise the mirror when he hears the sound of an M-16
action being worked Epps turns to face Jaeger

JAEGER

I cant do it Epps Not when were so
close I cant let you ruin everything

Epps just stares at Jaeger not frightened

calm

EPPS
First Wes now you

JAEGER

Im not like Wes Wes was crazy

EPPS
(Sarcastic)

but surprisingly

And you youve got it all together

JAEGER

I dont want it this way I wouldnt
kill you just to kill you but I cant

let you lose the gold for me
were so close

EPPS

Not when

That helicopter passes and the only

thing were close to is death
Jaeger is unfazed Very politely he says

JAEGER
Sit down Epps

Epps takes him up on the offer What choice does he have
THE CAMERA STAYS TIGHT ON THE TWO MEN They dont talk
They dont move They just sit as WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE
HELICOPTER GETTING CLOSER AND LOUDER IT REACHES A
CRESCENOO THEN BEGINS TO FADE UNTIL IT DISAPPEARS The
chopter is gone along with Epps and Jaegers best chance of
getting out of the desert alive

Jaeger lowers his rifle Very genuinely he says

JAEGER (CONT)
Im sorry about that Epps

EPPS
Is it all right if I stand up

Like he didnt know he was keeping Epps from something

JAEGER
Oh yeah Go ahead

Epps stands He looks around trying to figure things out
Not much to figure There still in the middle of a desert in
a hostile country same as they ever were

JAEGER (CONT)
Im glad I didnt have to kill you Im
glad it didnt come to that

EPPS
Yeah Well me too

JAEGER
I never killed anybody before I talk a
good game but Im not like that

EPPS
Sure

JAEGER
Really Im not Remember how I was
talking I wanted to blow away all those
Iraqis Thats all it was was talk I
was scared out of my mind to go to war
I still havent gotten over stepping on
that land mine
EPPS
You still got a map on you

JAEGER
What Yeah

Jaeger takes out the maps he has and hands them to Epps
Epps looks them over then looks over the terrain Without
any landmarks or navigating tools the maps might as well be
finger paintings

JAEGER (CONT)
Epps

EPPS
Yeah

JAEGER

I dont want to die

EPPS
Makes two of us

JAEGER
I know what I did just now was crazy but
you got to understand how much I want
that gold

EPPS
Its all right I dont like it but
its over now

JAEGER
I never had anything before Epps I
never was anybody Not the kind of
somebody you can be with a pocket full of
gold coins When I was in high school I
used to--

Fed up with Jaeger Epps turns on him hard

EPPS
Hey you know what Can I be honest with
you Right now Im not all that
interested in how youre messed up cause
you didnt get the bicycle you wanted for
your thirteenth birthday What Im
interested in is how I can keep from
getting dead And listening to sob
stories from some about how the
system wasnt good to him because he had
to work like everybody else instead of
being born a Kennedy doesnt do a damn
thing to help keep me alive So do me a
favor either shut up orjust shut up

Jaeger isnt sure what to say

JAEGER
Sorry

EPPS
Damn

Epps sits down in the sand all out of ideas Theres a long
quiet before Jaeger says

JAEGER
What do you think our chances are

EPPS
If we can find the Hummer or some
friendlies by sundown we might be okay
Weve got enough water for that But we
wont make another day otherwise

Again they sit for a beat

JAEGER
Wonder how the wars going

EPPS
Its got to be going better than this

Epps stands and has a last look around

EPPS CONT)
All right pick a direction

Jaeger just gives a surprised look

EPPS (CONT)
We cant just sit here Weve got to
start moving so pick

JAEGER
You sure you want me too

Epps nods Jaeger stands and takes a good look around He
considers things although there isnt much to consider
Finally he decisively points in a direction

JAEGER (CONT)
I pick that way
EPPS
Okay Then we go this way

Epps heads off in the opposite direction
FADE TO
EXT DESERT - LATER

Epps and Jaeger make the long march across the sand Theres
so much nothing out there its maddening

FADE TO
EXT DESERT - LATER

Epps drops down in the sand He lets his pack slide fram his
back then pulls his water and takes a healthy swig He puts
his pack back on and struggles to his feet As Jaeger
crosses he takes Epps by the shoulder and helps to pull him
up The two wade on

FADE TO
EXT DESERT - EVENING

Epps and Jaeger are trekking as they have been doing all day
They look worn out but they keep moving Jaeger is several
paces behind Epps

JAEGER
Getting cold

EPPS
Its a desert Thats what deserts do at
night they get cold

JAEGER
EppsEpps Im gonna stop for a
second

EPPS
No

JAEGER

Just let me rest for a second

EPPS
Weve got to keep moving while theres
still light
JAEGER
You know what Im going to do Im just
going to take a second I want to look
at the gold

EPPS
Dont you touch it

JAEGER
I just want to look at it Remind me of
what Im dying for

EPPS
The deal was no one touches it until we
get out of here

JAEGER
Yeah but we made that deal while Wes was

still alive Hes gone Time for a new
deal

Jaeger takes the pack from his back and starts to open it
Epps turns and races back to him grabbing him by the wrist
and forcing Jaeger to let go of the pack

EPPS
You listen to me If if we get out of
this I dont care what you do with your
share but until then youve only got one
thing to think about and thats staying
alive So you leave that gold alone or
you and I are going to have to have a
serious talk

Epps waits for a response from Jaeger but gets none

Jaegers eyes seem to be glazed and his stare fixed on a
point well beyond Epps He raises a hand points off into
the distance

JAEGER
Look

Epps turns and looks Off a ways is a light in the window of
what looks to be a shack-type building Epps stares at it as
if it were the holy Grail

JAEGER (CONT)
What do you figure it is

EPPS
Place all alone like that Must be a
boarder check point

JAEGER
Which boarder Saudi Kuwait Syria

EPPS
Couldnt be Syria We couldnt have gone
that far north Its got to be Saudi
Come on

Epps heads for the shack doing double time Jaeger puts the
pack back on and races to catch up

EPPS (CONT
Theyve got to have water Well get
same water some directions maybe they
even have a vehicle

JAEGER
Epps

EPPS
We can head back for our lines and they
dont even have to know about the gold

JAEGER
Epps What if theyre not Saudi

Epps stops dead now not more than one hundred meters from
the shack

JAEGER (CONT)
If its a checkpoint it could be Iraqi

Epps considers this

EPPS
Weve got no cboice Either way weve
got no choice

Epps and Jaeger keep on for the shack walking with
apprehension now instead of running Epps stops less than
fifty meters away

JAEGER
Well

EPPS
Well we should identify ourselves

JAEGER
Yeah I guess we should
Epps takes in a deep breath ready to yell to the shack
Instead he turns to Jaeger

EPPS
Even if they are Iraqis probably all
theyll do is take us prisoner for
awhile Got to figure were still
kicking their asses in the war They
dont want any trouble

JAEGER
Hell theyll probably just surrender to
us Probably

Again Epps takes a deep breath And again just as hes about
to cry out he turns to Jaeger

EPPS
Thats if the war is even still going on
Way things were shaping up its probably
long over

JAEGER
Probably

Epps takes a beat then sucks in a breath He yells for the
shack

EPPS
Hellooooo--

Before Epps can even finish getting the word out machine gun
fire erupts from the house and burns towards Epps and Jaeger
They dive for cover hugging the ground as bullets whistle
and ping through the space around them They are forced back
and down against a narrow stretch of rock but it offers
little protection and is chipped away by the hot lead Its
just a matter of moments before nothing stands before them
and death At the top of his lungs Jaeger starts yelling

JAEGER
Ashra Ka mahari dahra sahib Ashra Ka
mahari dahra sahib

Just as quickly as it began the shooting stops From the
shack we hear some chatter in Arabic then the door opens A
few MEN appear in the doorway They laugh and beckon for
Epps and Jaeger to join them

EPPS
What did you say
JAEGER
I dont know Something Wes had taught
me I think it means Dont shoot
Were your friends

EPPS
They must be Saudis Its a Saudi
checkpoint Oh sweet Jesus Come on
Come on

Epps hurriedly stumbles in the dark for the shack Jaeger is
just steps behind him

They enter the dimly lit shack to the good nature of the FOUR
men inside Epps and Jaeger see a fire in an open hearth and
go right to it to warm their bands as the four men go on
chattering behind them

JAGER
Oh man this is good What do you think
the chances are theyve got a whirlpool
in this place

As they rub their hands together Epps looks up He freezes
Hanging on the wall is a very handsome nicely framed
portrait of Saddam Hussein Epps nudges Jaeger who also
looks up He also freezes

JAEGER (CONT)
Oh God

EPPS
They must have thought we were Iraqi when
you yelled to them They couldnt tell
in the dark

JAEGER
What are we going to do

Epps thinks What are they going to do

EPPS
Slip out your M-16

JAEGER
And then what

EPPS
And then shoot them

JAEGER
II never killed anyone before I told
you that

EPPS
Well youre going to start with a bang
cause youve got four of them to take down

Behind Epps and Jaeger one of the Iraqis asks a question of
them in Arabic

JAEGER
Cant you--

EPPS
I dont have a weapon

Again the Iraqi asks the question We can tell by the tone
of his voice he expects an answer

EPPS (CONT)
Dont go bitch on me now You were going
to kill me Kill them

JAEGER
I just said I would I dont think I--

EPPS
Shoot them

The Iragis sense that something is wrong They move
menacingly for their weapons

EPPS (CONT)
Shoot them Jaeger SHOOT THEM

Jaeger whips around at the same time pulling his M-16 He
jerks back hard on the trigger spraying back and forth back
and forth

Dig it The Iraqis do a death dance in the strobe light of
the muzzle flashes They do the twist they do the jerk
then they all fall down

The bullets that miss do a nasty job of redecorating the
place shredding walls eating up wood

Jaeger keeps firing until his clip is empty He stands
huffing eyes glazed like hes a million miles away from what
he just did Epps steps up and takes the weapon from Jaeger
Thats like an alarm clock that brings Jaeger back to the
land of the living Jaeger takes one look around at all the
carnage then doubles over and gets to puking
Epps just watches this pathetic sight When Jaeger is all
done

EPPS (CONT)
Lets get some sleep

FADE TO
BLACK

FADE TO
INT SHACK - MORNING

The sun has just pushed itself well above the horizon as
Jaeger comes awake The second he does he sees a MAN - Arab
wearing white robes - peering through the window Jaeger
gives a start and the man disappears Jaeger quickly shakes
Epps awake

JAEGER
EppEpps Theres someone at the
window

This wakes Epps up quick

EPPS
An Iraqi

JAEGER
I dont know He didnt have a uniform
on Hehe had on white robes like the
guys who killed Wes

Epps does some quick figuring then staying low scrambles
across the floor to one of the dead Iraqis and grabs up his
weapon He grabs another one tosses it to Jaeger

Carefully still low Epps creeps over to the window Slowly
he raises up and looks out

JAGER (CONT)
See anything

EPPS
Nothing

Epps lowers himself back down and does some thinking

JAEGER
What do we do
EPPS
We cant stay here Even if that wasnt
an Iraqi soldier its only a matter of
time before some show up Get all the
water you can carry and well head out
on foot

JAEGER
To where

EPPS
Sun rises in the East We go the
opposite direction May not find
anything but at least well know were
heading towards Saudi Arabia

As Jaeger gathers up what water he can find creeps for
the door With the muzzle of his gun he pulls it open a
crack and peers out Still nothing Its like the man
vanished into thin air

Jaeger stocked up on water comes over with the gold and
Epps pack which Epps shoulders

EPPS (CONT)
Ready

Jaeger nods Epps opens the door and the two men carefully
snake their way out weapons at the ready It seems though
there is nothing to be ready for There is no one around

Suddenly the man appears from around the shack Epps and
Jaeger turn on him targeting with their assault weapons but
they do not fire The man just stands He doesnt say
anything he makes no threatening moves The three stay
still as statues for several beats until Epps jerks his head
indicating to Jaeger they should move on That they do
weapons still on the man until they are beyond his range

They walk on a little ways Jaeger spots something and
thrusts a finger in its direction

JAEGER
Look

Mounted on a horse riding on a dune that runs parallel to
them is ANOTHER ARAB MAN He makes no effort to draw nearer
to Epps and Jaeger but nor does he lose them

JAEGER (CONT)
What do we do

EPPS
We keep going thats what we do We
ignore them maybe they ignore us

As if to be contrary to Epps statement ANOTHER TWO ARABS ON
HORSE BACK appear up over a dune before them

JAEGER
Jesus How many of them are there

Epps doesnt know and he doesnt want to find out They
change direction heading away from the Arabs But again MORE
ARABS ride up over a dune Epps gets the feeling he and
Jaeger are about to be boxed in

EPPS
I dont like this Lets go

Epps breaks into a run Jaeger is only steps behind him

Like something out of an old John Ford western dozens of
mounted Arabs suddenly appear over a dune They ride fast
and hard for Epps and Jaeger like Apaches heading for a wagon
train They easily overtake our two momentarily swallowing
them amongst the thundering hoofs and ride on a bit as if
playing with them

Epps and Jaeger stop then bolt in the other direction The
Arabs ride back again past Epps and Jaeger swiping them to
the ground the horses kicking up a spray of lose sand over
them It looks like a cattle round up and our two are the
cattle

Epps and Jaeger get up to make another run of it and again
the Arabs bear down on them This time they mean business
They completely surround them cutting off all means of
escape The Arabs start screaming something back and forth
in Arabic We dont know what but it sounds unpleasant

Epps and Jaeger come skidding to a halt They turn in their
tracks digging in the scene It goes like this They are
completely outnumbered and out gunned by a mounted force
Doesnt get any simpler

Epps and Jaeger drop their weapons Their hands go in the
air

CUT TO

EXT SHIITE CAMP - LATER
The mounted Arabs lead Epps and Jaeger hands tied before
them and almost literally being towed by the horses into
their camp It is similar to the Shiite camps weve seen
before with several tent dwellings

As the party enters groups of Shiites come over to stare at
Epps and Jaeger They chatter amongst themselves but our
boys have no idea what theyre talking about and that just
makes things all the scarier

From our boys point of view this is all like an unending
nightmare Being dragged along through a desert not knowing
the language not knowing whats going to happen Their
world skews and slides as if they were on a tilt-a-whirl

Finally they reach a tent One of the Arabs tosses Epps and
Jaegers packs on the ground just before it Another cuts
them loose and SHOVES THEM INSIDE THE TENT then yells
something at them in Arabic He leaves and our two are
alone

JAEGER
What do you make of them

EPPS
Shiites I think

JAEGER
Is that good or bad

EPPS
I dont know They killed Wes

JAEGER
Why havent they killed us

EPPS
I dont know

JAEGER
Maybemaybe we can fight our way
out

EPPS
With what Against how many

JAEGER
We cant just sit here waiting to die

EPPS
You come up with a better plan let me
know

JAEGER
Maybemaybe if we traded them the gold
If we gave it to them they might let us
live they might not kill us

From OC we hear a voice

VOICE (OC)
I always knew you were a bitch

Epps and Jaegers hearts seize up and stop Its as if
theyve heard the voice of a ghost and they have ITS WES
He carries with him the pack of gold Epps can barely get
his name out

EPPS
-Wes

JAEGER
You were shot We were standing right
there you were shot

WES
In the flack jacket Still like getting
hit in the back with a baseball bat
Took the air right out of me but I was
just unconscious for awhile Course
you didnt stick around to find that out
You left me for dead

EPPS
We thought--

Like a guy who just took two steps over the edge

WES
YOU LEFT ME FOR DEAD

Ohhh shit Somebodys crazy Epps gets the feeling theres
not going to be much dialog going on here Wes gets real
calm again which is almost as scary as him acting nuts

WES (CONT)
When my Shiite friends saw that they had
shot an American they were very
apologetic Turns out weve been kicking
ass in this little war They figure
weve finally gotten Saddam off their
backs They brought me to their camp
cleaned me up fed me Im their new
best buddy America number one Joe

But theres something the Shiites cant
figure out They cant figure out why my
two buddies two fellow Americans left
me out in the desert They cant seem to
figure out what those same two guys were
doing in an Iraqi outpost Its almost
as if they were Iraqi spies or
something And Ive got to tell you they
hate anything thats got to do with the
Iraqis See how I mean

JAEGER
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint
Jesus Wes I killed the Iraqis in there

WES
You actually got around to killing
someone Im impressed I guess youre
only half a bitch

EPPS
Wes we thought you were dead and we
thought we were next Hanging around to
get killed wouldnt have done anyone any
good

WES
Sure and I guess it was just convenient
there was one less person to split the
gold with

EPPS
Wes--

WES
Look I know you guys are telling the
truth Its just the Shiites dont know
that I guess you could tell thembut
then you dont speak the language do you

Wes gets right up into Jaegers face

WES CONT)
Do you

Of course Wes knows they dont He allows himself a very
sweet shit eating grin

WES CONT)
Theyre going to kill you slow Ill see
to that
He steps away and starts to open the pack of gold

WES (CONT)
Thanks for taking care of this for me

EPPS
Tell me something Wes Are you crazy
greedy or just stupid Jaeger says
youre crazy

JAEGER
I didnt say that I never said--

EPPS
Me I say you dont have enough brains
to be stupid

For a second Wes is taken by surprise by the statement

but

he smiles at Epps boldness He sets down the pack of gold

and gets right up into Epps face

WES
You disappoint me Epps Always figured
you to be a man a real bright guy I
had respect for you

EPPS
That why you tried to put a bullet in my
head in the middle of the desert

WES
Thats just what things came to
Sometimes you cant help that It
doesnt change me respecting you And
now you let me down I expected more
from you you know I really did I
expected you to--

A KNIFE SLIDES UP INTO FRAME UNTIL THE THE TIP RESTS JUST

UNDER WES THROAT CHOKING OFF HIS WORDS
Now its Epps turn to go smug

EPPS
You expect this

Wes got nothing to say To Jaeger

EPPS (CONT)
Get the gold
Jaeger grabs up the pack

EPPS (CONT)

(To Wes)
Now lets try things another way Lets
try this You and me and Jaeger are

going to walk out of here Were going
to walk out all smiling and friendly so
your little Shiite buddies wont suspect
a thing Then were going to hop on some
horses and ride away and live happily
ever after Its all going to happen
just like that because if it doesnt
then Im going to gut you like a fat pig
You understand mesoldier

Wes says nothing

EPPS (CONT)
Ill take that as a yes

Epps gruffly spins Wes around and presses the knife up
against his back so that it is hidden

EPPS MARCHES WES OUTSIDE THE TENT stopping momentarily to
grab up his pack with his free hand To Jaeger he says

EPPS (CONT)
Get the water

Jaeger does as hes told
WES

Theyll kill you You wont make it ten
feet before they cut you down

EPPS
You dont know John Epps very well do
you

JAEGER

Can you ride a horse

EPPS
No but I figure nows a real good time
to start

They walk on through the camp towards some saddled horses
They pass a Shiite who says something to Wes in Arabic
Epps gives Wes a poke in the back with the knife

EPPS (CONT)
Dont say anything

The Shiite obviously expecting an answer says whatever it
was he said again

EPPS (CONT)
Just keep quiet

WES
I have to answer him

EPPS
So you can give us away

WES
If I dont answer hell know somethings
up

Epps gives this a lot of thought in a very short time

EPPS
You answer him but you answer him wrong
and youre going to be staring at your
insides while youre dying

Wes very calmly says something to the Shiite The Shiite
just stands there for a beat looking at the three men then
suddenly explodes in screams No way of knowing for sure
what hes saying but since hes going off like a Westec
alarm its a pretty good bet hes been tipped of

Epps rears back a fist and slams it into Wes face

EPPS (CONT)
Bastard

Epps and Jaeger take off running for the horses practically
leaping into the saddles as Shiites come pouring out of
their tents Forgetting himself Wes screams in English

WES
Stop them

Jaeger and Epps spur their horses and take off riding hard
Its amazing what you can do when a bunch of angry Shiites
are chasing you

Wes grabs an assault weapon from a near by Shiite and mounts
up with blood in his eyes He leads a charge of armed
mounted Shiites that looks like a posse going after some bad
men
Out front Epps and Jaeger pull up for a second

JAEGER
They coming

Epps takes a look behind him He cant hardly miss the
sandstorm Wes and the Shiites kick up as they ride for them

EPPS
Oh yeah Theyre coming

Epps points off to some foothills in the distance Its the
only thing close to cover for miles around

EPPS (CONT)
Ride for the hills Well try to lose
them

They take the reigns to their horses and get to riding

Behind them Wes yells to his riders and signals for them to
split up and try to cut off Epps and Jaeger

pps and Jaeger hit the hills They ride up for a bit then
top to spot Wes Wes and his crew are better riders and
ave closed the gap All the two can do now is try to lose
hem in the terrain

atau wh

Epps and Jaeger ride as best they can and somewhat
erratically to cover their trail They head up a ways then
cut across in a parallel direction Jaeger looks back but
sees no sign of Wes

JAEGER
We lost them

Just as the words leave Jaegers mouth a hail of bullets
explodes the ground before them Their horses rear up and
its all they can do to fight them Just ahead are the
Shiites who split off from Wes having circled around Epps
and Jaeger

The two yank their horses back and ride hard in the opposite
direction with the Shiites just behind They fire on Epps
and Jaeger the bullets pinging off the rocks all around them

Epps and Jaeger are little more than passengers on their
horses as they run wild like stampeding mustangs And good
for it too otherwise they might be dead by now They break
for a trail that leads further up the mountain but it

does little to shake loose their pursuers

As Epps and Jaeger level out they can see the trail below
them and Wes and his posse riding for them Our two start
back the way they came but the other Shiites crest the
hill

JAEGER (CONT)
Which way

Epps looks from side to side Either way is certain death
Then he looks off towards an embankment It is VERY steep
VERY treacherous

It would take an expert rider to make it down the embankment
safely All Epps knows is there arent any gun totting
Shiites in that direction

JAEGER (CONT)
Which way do we go

EPPS
We go this way

Fear gives way to desperation Both men whip their steeds
hard The beasts leap to the embankment and start the wild
ride down Both Epps and Jaeger have to lean back in their
saddles until theyre almost parallel to the ground just to
stay on their horses

Wes sees this and swears He signals to his men to cut back
the other way

Epps reaches the bottom of the embankment Jaeger is almost
there when he looses control of his horse Both rider and
animal go tumbling in an ugly fall

EPPS (CONT)
Jaeger

The horse gets up and bolts off before Jaeger can get to her

Just then Wes and his men make it back down the trail and
start riding hard for Jaeger

Epps pulls his horse around and takes off for his fallen
comrade As he rides in he leans to the side and low
Stretching out an arm Epps literally scoops Jaeger and
swings him up behind him A couple of rodeo performers
couldnt have done it better

Problem is with the extra weight they cant go very fast
Wes and his men close hard now The bullets fly fast and
furious swarming all around our boys
Epps whips the horse trying to get everything shes got to

give This is it They get away now or not at all Their
horse finds a little something extra She goes faster
faster

Suddenly Epps pulls up hard on the reins The horse rears
up she goes wild It takes everything Epps has to control
her But better that than if shed taken another stride
Theyve come to the edge of a very very sharp cliff Epps
may be a good rider for a novice but no way he could get
this beast to fly

Finally he calms the horse down but it doesnt matter Wes
and the Shiites ride up behind them cutting them off Wes
stands down from his horse

Epps and Jaeger with nowhere to go do the same

WES
The gold give it to me

Epps takes the pack from Jaeger but doesnt throw it to Wes

WES (CONT)
Give it to me

EPPS
If I give it to you will you let us go

Wes smiles and lies so badly he doesnt even bother trying to
fake it

WES
Sure Whatever you want For old time
sake

Epps has got no choice really He tosses the pack to Wes
feet who stoops to pick it up Wes starts to open the pack

WES (CONT)
Looks like at the end of the day we
finally find out whos better than who
dont we Epps Like I said I expected
more from you

EPPS
Its like I said you dont really know
lieutenant John Epps very well do you

Wes rips open the pack Hes got about one second to see
whats inside NO GOLD JUST A BOOBY TRAPPED CLAYMORE MINE
Epps grabs Jaeger and yanks to him to the ground

There is a horrific furry of sound and fire that easily
destroys Wes and a few of the Shiite standing next to him
The rest along with the horses scatter for dear life

Epps stays down until the coast is clear then gets up
Jaeger to say the least is stunned

EPPS (CONT)
Damn it We lost the horses

JAEGER
Thethe gold

EPPS
It wasnt the gold It was the claymore
mine The golds in my pack

JAEGER
When did you make the switch

EPPS
Its always been like that When you
left me down in the crevice to send the
gold up I figured Id bettertake
precautions I rigged it to blow if
anyone opened the pack Just in case
somebody thought they could do better on
their own

JAEGER
But

EPPS
We had a deal No one touches the gold
until were out of here No one breaks
the deal no one had anything to worry
about

JAEGER
What if it hadnt been Wes What ifI
mean accidently what if I had

EPPS
You shouldnt think about things like
that Itll just make you crazy

We hold on the two men on the smoking remains of Wes We
hold on them then
FADE TO
BLACK

FADE TO
EXT DESERTROAD - LATER

Epps and Jaeger come up to the road a small highway Its
eerie a road in the middle of the desert Quiet No cars
They just stand and stare at it for a beat

JAEGER
Well

EPPS
A cars got to come along sooner or
later When it does we jack it

JAEGER
How do we do that

EPPS
You lie in the middle of the road look
like youre hurt When the car stops I
run over to the driver and put a gun to
his head

JAEGER
Why do I have to lie in the road

EPPS
Somebody has to

JAEGER
Yeah but why me What if the car
doesnt stop

EPPS
Then Im a rich man

Epps sits by the side of the road waiting for a car The
only thing he gets is more quiet Jaeger sits next to him
After a couple of beats

JAEGER
Epps

EPPS
Yeah

JAEGER
They sita

I want you to know I dont know I
just think youre a hell of a guy

EPPS
Thanks

JAEGER
This whole time youve kept your head
You didnt go money simple like me and
Wes Youve just been trying to figure
how to get us out of here And youve
been fair too I mean even after
Iyou know

EPPS
Threatened to blow my brains out

JAEGER
Yeah Even after that You didnt take
it out on me except for maybe making me
lie in the middle of the road now But
Id say youve been very fair I just
think its a hell of a man who can keep
from going money simple

EPPS
Dont make so much out of it Only
reason I havent figured a way to get all

that money for myself is because Ive
been too busy figuring ways to stay
alive Believe me if I had a minute to
catch my breath I might have played
things the way you and Wes had Im no
better than anybody else Ive just been
busier
while more Still no car

JAEGER
Epps

EPPS
What

JAEGER

Im thinking about taking a trip

EPPS
Thought you were going to buy a car

JAEGER
Still am Theres more gold than I
thought and since theres only two of us
now Where should I go

EPPS
I dont know

JAEGER
Ive never been anywhere I wouldnt
know where to go Where would you go

EPPS
How the hell should I know

Another long beat Still no car

EPPS (CONT)
Australia

JAEGER
What

EPPS
Id go to Australia Lot of land not
many people I think after this Id like
to quit people for awhile And the girls
go crazy for brothers down there

JAEGER
Really

EPPS
Thats what I hear Dont matter Girls
go crazy everywhere for a man with gold

From the distance we hear the faint sound of a car motor It
draws closer and closer

Epps and Jaeger stand Knowing theyre so close to the end
of a long adventure they become very business like

JAEGER
Well this is it We get the car find
some Americans We find Americans well
be all right

EPPS
Well make up some kind of lie They
wont find the gold

Epps and Jaeger just stand staring at each other as the car
draws closer
JAEGER
Okay See you in a minute

Jaeger goes out and lays in the cars path Epps goes to
hide behind some rocks

The car keeps getting closer and closer
Jaeger yells over to Epps

JAEGER (CONT)
Epps I dont think hes slowing down

EPPS
Hell slow down

The car gets closer

JAEGER
Hes not slowing

EPPS
Hes going to slow down

The car gets closer

JAEGER
EppsEpps

The car barrels right for Jaeger Forget what Epps says
its not slowing down and Jaeger knows it

JAEGER (CONT)
Aw damn

At the last possible second Jaeger rolls out of the way The
car doesnt slow tearing across the stretch of road where
Jaeger lay but swerves to avoid him The DRIVER loses
control for a few seconds and is forced to skid to a halt

Epps runs to the car rips open the drivers door and
presses the muzzle of an assault weapon to his head

EPPS
You speak English DO YOU SPEAK
ENGLISH

DRIVER
(Frightened)
Y-yes

Jaeger runs over and jumps in the car Epps gets in behind
the driver keeping the gun pressed to his head

EPPS
Where were you going

DRIVER
Baghdad

EPPS
Whats in the other direction

DRIVER
This road it leads straight to Kuwait

EPPS
Turn the car around

DRIVER
Please I beg of you The American army
is there I am Iraqi They will kill
me

EPPS
Nobodys going to hurt you

Epps takes a gold coin from his back and gives it to the driver

EPPS (CONT)
You see that Gold You take us to the
Americans and well give you another
one Now drive

The driver turns around the car and starts back in the
direction he came

They drive on for awhile mostly in silence Epps and Jaeger
are too anxious to have this all over to say much and the
driver is too scared Finally the driver starts to talk

DRIVER
You are Americans yes

Neither Jaeger or Epps answer

DRIVER (CONT)

We didnt not all want this war do you
know We didnt not all want to invade
our brothers and sisters in Kuwait Now
your army crushes us So few days and
so many have died And many fear we will
all die Please tell this to your
people We did not want this war
Still Jaeger and Epps say nothing Outside the car the
traffic flowing in the opposite direction gradually gets
thicker and thicker

DRIVER (CONT)
I have a brother in our army When I
take you back will you look for him If
he is still alive will you look for him
and take care of him

This last bit gets to Epps

EPPS
Yeah Well look for him

Outside the traffic away from Kuwait has gotten so thick
everything is at a stand still There are Iraqi military
vehicles pulling out as well as a good many civilian cars
and trucks It clogs up both lanes and envelopes the car
Some people try to make their way on foot as it is now much
faster

JAEGER
Look at this

DRIVER
Iraqis They are fleeing from Kuwait
from your military

EPPS
See if you cant drive around this

The driver tries to work the car free of the congestion but
hes wedged in and not going anywhere

From out of the sky swoop down a flight of AMERICAN F-15E
FIGHTER JETS They swing down on the far end of the highway
engines roaring like angry lions For a second time stands
still Everyone on the road stops and looks up at the jets

Time starts again and with a deadly vengeance

The fighter pilots begin to strafe the highway Vehicles and
people civilian and military alike There is no
distinction only carnage

This is the infamous Al Jahra highway from Basrah to Kuwait

City that was strafed with deadly accuracy over and over on

the last day of the war by American forces It became known
as the Highway of Death
The huge shells rip a bloody path shredding cars and trucks
igniting explosions straight towards the car with Epps
Jaeger and the driver With barely seconds to go before they
are shot to pieces as well They dive from the car Epps
dragging the driver out and scramble for cover along the
side of the road

The planes turn back for another pass

JAEGER
What the hell are they doing Therere
civilians in there

Not even thinking about what hes doing Jaeger jumps up and
screams at the jets

JAEGER (CONT)
DONT SHOOT DONT SHOOT THEYRE
CIVILIANS

Epps jumps up and drags Jaeger back down to cover as the
shells fram the jets cut dangerously close to them

The jets bank and swoop for another run

Epps realizes there is something wrong He looks around
desperately but doesnt seeTHERE BACK IN THE CAR

EPPS
The gold

Epps runs for the car trying to beat the jets

JAEGER
No

Jaeger lunges for Epps but misses him Epps snakes his way
through the burning hulks towards their car He dodges
jukes and weaves among shells shrapnel and explosions that
go off all around him He just makes it to the car grabbing
up the gold as the fighters once again swing low and cut
loose

A wicked hail of shells reigns down It sets off a series of
violent explosions that knocks Jaeger off his feet It takes
him a beat to recover By then the fighters have done their
job and fly off

Jaeger stands He walks towards the road over the plaintive
wails of the barely living The car the gold Epps they
are essentially disintegrated
AS THE CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP WE SEE THAT IT ISNT JUST
THEIR CAR AND EPPS THAT ARE GONE There isnt much of
anything left on this road Just death destruction and
bloodshed

FADE TO
BLACK
FADE TO

INT MILITARY COURTROOM - MONTHS LATER

Jaeger is cleaned up in dress uniform and sitting at a
table before a MILITARY TRIBUNAL He looks very sullen as
if this whole adventure has robbed him of his soul

The members of the tribunal just look pissed

CHIEF JUSTICE
The members of this tribunal have reached
a verdict Based on the evidence
presented we find the defended guilty as
charged of desertion insurrection
insubordination and conduct unbecoming
Further the tribunal will recommend that
the defendant be sentenced to life
imprisonment and that from this day
forward he shall no longer walk as a free
man You should consider yourself quite
fortunate son There was a time when
lesser crimes would have found you before
a firing squad I dont know that a
person like you has much to say for
himself but it is your right say
something

Jager doesnt stand He doesnt look at the tribunal He
just begins to talk

JAEGER
Im sorry I guess Not for looking for
the gold or leaving my post You know
what its like to have gold raining out
of your hands Thatll give me enough to
think about the rest of my days in the
brig Im just sorry about Wes He was
all right It was the gold that made him
what he became If I hadnt found that
map if I hadnt talked them into going
searchingWes just might have made it
home after all I guess I feel
responsible for him

CHIEF JUSTICE
The way I view things youre responsible
for the lives of two men Private First
Class Wes Hanmond and Second Lieutenant
John Epps

JAEGER
Yeah well Ive been thinking about
that See there was an explosion and
everything but I never really aaw Epps
get killed And nobody ever found the
gold I guess they both could have been
burned to slag I guess But there were
a lot of bodies out on that road A
smart man could have found some
identification to use A smart man could
have made his way up to Syria or Turkey
A smart man could have gotten himself
right out of the Middle East A smart
man with enough gold Way I figure
right about now old Epps is sitting in a
bar in Sydney or Melboure or maybe
Brisbane telling stories to one of the
prettiest Aussies you ever saw

The members of the tribunal just scoff

CHIEF JUSTICE
I find it highly unlikely that anyone
could accomplish such a thing

JAEGER
Well Sir I guess you dont know Second

Lieutenant John Epps very well do you

Jaeger allows himself a slight smile as he leaves the
tribunal with this question

FADE TO

BLACK
