liquor bottle From the pocket of his fishing slicker he
withdraws an object

CLOSE ON his hand He holds a small silver medallion Round

hand It WHISTLES in the wind

Brush RUSTLES behind him Then a soft THUMPING Footsteps

Nothing A noise of the night He turns back to the water
Water CRASHES against pilings Wood CREAKS as the dock
contantly settles The man looks about egain this time
staggering to his feet when suddenly
FIREWORKS EXPLODE in the distance illuminating the sky
interrupting the night He looks up to the sky his face
reflecting the spray of color as

RAY
Well actually honey and you know how

The man goes over the side taking Helen with him Suddenly
Julie swipes at the mans bloody head with her flashlight
Direct and hard The man releases Helen who falls back into
Ray and Barry

Julie shines the flashlight down at the water to see the
mans torso slowly sink below the surface His arm
outstretched sticking up the last part of his body to
submerge

They all look down to see his hand disappear below the
waters surface holdingclutching in its grasp

THE MAN

Barry reels backwards nearly chokingair escapes from his
mouth Theyre face to face The mans eyes remain closed

blurry trail

Barry reaches for the tiara and pries it loose when
suddenly

Barry freaks roaring backwards Tiara in hand he bolts
upward to the surface when

HES YANKED BACK DOWN

Barry out of air kicks madly looking down to see his legs
caught upentangled in

One picture in particular leaps out at Julie Her with her
arms wrapped tight around an older man with a kind face Her
father Julie shuts her eves

Mrs James appears from the kitchen She holds an envelope
in her hand She lays it on the coffee table

MRS JAMES

Julie looks to the fragrance counter her eyes shocked to
find

- Helen the sales clerk standing behind the counter
adjusting a perfume display her hands moving quickly
nervously CLOSE ON her face Her once classic looks now
seem harsh and stark under her mask of heavy make-up

This is a different Helen Except for the hair Its as big
and luscious as ever It hangs so thick and full around her
face she appears to be hiding in it

ELSA
Frightening isnt it

Helen looks up and spots Julie and for the first time in
probably a long time smiles

HELEN
Julie Oh my God

Elsa takes off leaving Julie and Helen alone An awkward
moment as Julie moves closer Helens hands tremble

HELEN

Barry bolts moving around a fishboat that sits up on a dry
dock He slips through the pilings just missing being
RAMMED into the boat

Feet pounding Barry charges for the boardwalk trying
desperately to outrun the car as it speeds towards him He
crosses over to the boardwalk but the BMW doesn‘t flinch
It torpedoes towards him

Barry comes to a dead end Crab pots stacked in front of an
old billboard He looks about sizing up his options The
BMW hits the brakes reverses and spins the car around
sharply so that it faces Barry head on Barrys trapped
The car IDLES as if egging him on daring him to make a run
for it

Barry tries to make out whos driving But it’s too dark
all he can see is a SHAPE The car REVS Barry scared

everywhere His body unmoving

CLOSE ON Barrys face Terrified but somehow conscious A
piece of glass stuck in the cheek below his left eye He
squirms wiggles tries to free himself but its useless
His legs are trapped by the grill of the car

Barry near tears lifts himself up looking towards the car
He tries to get up but fails collapsing falling face down
onto the boardwalk

Julie looks around the less than modest kitchen Water drips
from leaky pipes Her eyes zero in on cracking wall paper

his head-his face young and sweethe picks a CHILD up
and places him on his shoulders for a better view Father
and son

Helen turns to the other Fisherman his face is also in
viewan older man graying She looks up and down the
street local Fisherman are everywhere

This calms her a bit realizing this is a normal sight in a
fishing town She takes a deep calming breath and exhales
but then sees

ANOTHER FISHERMAN

This one stands alone with the hood over his head He stands
right on the streets edgeas close as you can get to the
floats She passes by him waving smiling He pulls his
hand from his coat pocket to reveal a large shiny curved
object

Helen looks at it closely Its a fish hook Sharp and
deadly It disappears back in his coat pocket A very
deliberate move He was showing it to her Flaunting it

The float breezes right by him Helen sits rigid in her seat
scared to move She scans the crowd for Barrysees him

MISSY
He left a suicide note

Missy moves toward the shed to an old wooden box She opens
it sifts through it withdrawing a crumpled piece of paper

MISSY
I had to keep it hidden His insurance
policy wouldnt pay if it was a suicide
Dont guess it matters anymore The
moneys been spent

She hands the letter to Julie CLOSE ON the letter
Scrawled in very familiar writing are the words

I WILL NEVER FORGET LAST SUMMER

Julie inspects the letter carefully She has seen this
handwriting before

JULIE
This isnt a suicide note This is a
death threat
