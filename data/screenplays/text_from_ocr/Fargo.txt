FARGO

place
names

been

a screenplay by
Ethan Coen
and
Joel Coen
The following text fades in over black
This is a true story The events depicted in this film took
in Minnesota in 1987 At the request of the survivors the
have been changed Out of respect for the dead the rest has
told exactly as it occured
FLARE TO WHITE

FADE IN FROM WHITE

Slowly the white becomes a barely perceptible image white
particles wave over a white background A snowfall

A car bursts through the curtain of snow

The car is equipped with a hitch and is towing another car
a brand-new light brown Cutlass Ciera with the pink sales
sticker showing in its rear window

As the car roars past leaving snow swirling in their dirft
the title of the film fades in

FARGO

Green highway signs point the way to MOOREHEAD
MINNESOTAFARGO NORTH DAKOTA The roads for the two cities
diverge A sign says WELCOME TO NORTH DAKOTA and another
just after says NOW ENTERING FARGO ND POP 44412

The car pulls into a Rodeway Inn
HOTEL LOBBY

A man in his early forties balding and starting to paunch
goes to the reception desk The clerk is an older woman

CLERK
And how are you today sir

MAN

- Mr Anderson
The man prints Jerry Lundega onto a registration card
then hastily crosses out the last name and starts to print
Anderson

As she types into a computer

CLERK
Okay Mr Anderson and youre

us just the night then

ANDERSON

HOTEL ROOM
The man turns on the TV which shows the local evening news

NEWS ANCHOR

KATIE

It was supposed to be a project
funded by the city council it
was supposed to benefit those
Fargo-Moorehead children who

would otherwise not be able to
afford to attend a lakeshore
summer camp But nobody consulted
city controller Stu Jacobson

CHAIN RESTAURANT
Anderson sits alone at a table finishing dinner Muzak
plays A middle-aged waitress approaches holding a pot of

regular coffee in one hand and decaf in the other

WAITRESS

ANDERSON

The man looks at his watch
THROUGH A WINDSHIELD

We are pulling into the snowswept parking lot of a one-story
brick building Broken neon at the top of the building
identifies it as the Jolly Troll Tavern A troll also in
neon holds a champagne glass aloft

INSIDE

The bar is downscale even for this town Country music
plays on the jukebox

Two men are seated in a booth at the back One is short
slight youngish The other man is somewhat older and
dour The table in front of them is littered with empty
long-neck beer bottles The ashtray is full

Anderson approaches

CLOSE ON TELEVISION

A morning-show host in an apron stands behind a counter on a
kitchen set

HOST
So I seperate the - how the heck
do I get the egg out of the shell
without breaking it

Jean Lundegaard is curled up on the couch with a cup of
coffee watching the television

HOSTESS
You just prick a little hole in
the end and blow
Jean smiles as we hear laughter and applause from the studio
audience She hears something else - a faint scraping sound

- and looks up

HOST
Okay here goes nothing

The scraping sound persists Jean sets down her coffee cup
and rises

From the studio audience

AUDIENCE
Awoooo

KITCHEN

We track toward the back door A curtain is stretched tight
across its window

Jean pulls the curtain back Bright sunlight amplified by
snow floods in

A man in an orange ski mask looks up from the lock

Jean gasps drops the curtain rutns and runs into -

- a taller man also in a ski mask already in the house
We hear the crack of the back-door window being smashed
The tall man - Gaear Grimsrud - grabs Jeans wrist

She screams staring at her own imprisoned wrist then wraps
her gaping mouth around Grimsruds gloved thumb and bites
down hard

He drops her wrist As Carl enters she races up the
stairs

GRIMSRUD
Unguent

CARL
Huh

Grimsurd looks at his thumb

GRIMSRUD
I need unguent

UPSTAIRS BEDROOM

As the two men enter a door at the far side is slamming
shut A cord snakes in under the door

MASTER BATHROOM

Jean sobbing frantically pushes at buttons on the princess
phone

The phone pops out of her hands jangles across the tile
floor smashes against the door and then bounces away its
cord ripped free

With a groaning sound the door shifts in its frame

BEDROOM

Grimsrud has a crowbar jammed in between the bathroom door
and frame and is working it

BATHROOM

Jean crosses to a high window above the toilet and throws it
open Snow that had drifted against the window sifts
lightly in Jean steps up onto the toilet

The door creaks moving as one piece in its frame

Jean glances back as she steps up from the toilet seat to
the tank

The groaning of the door ends with the wood around its knob
splintering and the knob itself falling out onto the floor

The door swings open

Grimsrud and Carl enter

THEIR POV

Room empty window open

Carl strides to the window and hoists himself out

Grimsrud opens the medicine cabinet and delicately taps
aside various bottles and tubes seeking the proper unguent

He finds a salve but after a moment sets it down noticing
something in the mirror

The shower curtain is drawn around the tub
He steps toward it

As he reaches for the curtain it explodes outward animated
by thrashing limbs

Jean screaming tangled in the curtain rips it off its
rings and stumbles out into the bedroom Grimsrud follows

BEDROOM

Jean rushes toward the door cloaked by the shower curtain
but awkwardly trying to push it off

UPSTAIRS LANDING

Still thrashing Jean crashes against the upstairs railing
trips on the curtain and falls thumping crazily down the
stairs

Grimsrud trots down after her

A PLAQUE WADE GUSTAFSON INCORPORTATED

PARKING LOT

We are high and wide on the office buildings parking lot
Jerry emerges wrapped in a parka his arms sticking stiffly
out at his sides his breath vaporizing He goes to his
car opens its front door pulls out a red plastic scraper
and starts methodically scraping off the thin crust of ice
that has developed on his windshield

The scrape-scrape-scrape sound carries in the frigid air

Jerry goes into a frenzy banging the scraper against the
windshield and the hood of his car

The tantrum passes Jerry stands pantin staring at nothing
in particular

Scrape-scrape-scrape - he goes back to work on the
windshield

FRONT DOOR
A beat silent but for a key scraping at the lock

The door swings open and Jerry edges in looking about
holding a sack of groceries

JERRY
Hon
He shuts the door

JERRY
Got the growshries

He has already seen the shower curtain on the floor He
frowns pokes at it with his foot

JERRY
Hon

UPSTAIRS BATHROOM

Jerry walks in He sets the groceries down on the toilet
tank

He looks at the open window through which snow still sifts
in He shuts it

He picks up the small tube of uguent that sits on the sink
frowns at it puts it back in the medicine chest

He looks at the shower curtain rod holding empty rings
FOYER

Once again we are looking at the rumpled shower curtain
From another room

JERRY

Beat

LIVING ROOM

Jerry stands in wide shot hands on hips looking down at a
telephone

After a motionless beat he picks up the phone and punches in
a number

JERRY
Yah Wade Gustafson please

BLACK
Hold in black

A slow tilt down from night sky brings the head of a large
paper-mache figure into frame It is a flannel-shirt
woodsman carrying a double-edged ax over one shoulder As
we hear the rumble of an approaching car the continuing
tilt and boom down brings us down the woodsmans body to a
pedestal

A sweep of headlights illuminates a sign on the pedestal
WELCOME TO BRAINDERD - HOME OF PAUL BUNYAN

The headlights sweep off and a car hums past and on into the
background The two-lane highway is otherwise empty

INT CAR

Carl drives Grimsrud smokes and gazes out the window
From the back seat we hear whimpering

Grimsrud turns to look

Jean lies bound and curled on the back seat underneath a
tarpaulin

GRIMSRUD
Shut the fuck up or Ill throw
you back in the trunk you know

CARL
Geez Thats moren Ive heard
you say all week

Grimsrud stares at him then turns back to the window

At a loud WHOOP Carl starts and looks back out the rear
window Fifty yards behind a state trooper has turned on
his gumballs

Carl eases the car onto the shoulder

CARL
Ah shit the tags
Grimsrud looks at him

CARL
Its just the tags I never
put my tags on the car Dont
worry Ill take care of this

He looks into the back seat as the car bounces and slows on
the gravel shoulder

CARL
Lets keep still back there
lady or were gonna have to ya
know to shoot ya

Grimsrud stares at Carl

CARL
Hey Ill take care of this

Both cars have stopped Carl looks up at the rear-view
mirror

The trooper is stopped on the shoulder just behind them
writing in his citation book

Carl watches

We hear the troopers door open

The trooper walks up the shoulder one hand resting lightly
on top of his holster his breath steaming in the cold night
air

Carl opens his window as the trooper draws up

CARL
How can I help you officer

The trooper scans the inside of the car taking his time
Grimsrud smokes and gazes calmly out his window
Finally

TROOPER
This is a new car then sir

CARL
It certainly is officer Still
got that smell

TROOPER
Youre required to display
temporary tags either in the
plate area or taped inside the
back window

CARL
Certainly -

TROOPER
Can I see your license and
registration please

CARL
Certainly

He reaches for his wallet

CARL
I was gonna tape up the
temporary tag ya know to be
in full compliance but it uh
it uh must a slipped my
mind

He extends his wallet toward the trooper a folded fifty-
dollar bill protruding from it

CARL
So maybe the best thing
would be to take care of that
right here in Brainerd

TROOPER
Whats this sir

CARL
Thats my license and regis-
tration I wanna be in
compliance

He forces a laugh

CARL
I was just thinking I could
take care of it right here In
Brainerd

The policeman thoughtfully pats the fifty into the billfold
and hands the billfold back into the car
TROOPER
Put that back in your pocket
please
Carls nervous smile fades
TROOPER
And step out of the car
please sir
Grimsrud smiling thinly shakes his head
There is a whimpering sound
The policeman hesitates
Another sound

The policeman leans forward into the car listening

Grimsrud reaches across Carl grabs the trooper by the hair
and slams his head down onto the car door

The policeman grunts digs awkwardly for footing outside and
throws an arm for balance against the outside of the car

With his free hand Grimsrud pops the glove compartment He
brings a gun out and reaches across Carl and shoots - BANG -
into the back of the troopers head

Jean screams

GRIMSRUD
Shut up

He releases the policeman

The policemans head slides out the window and his body
flops back onto the street

Carl looks out at the cop in the road

CARL
(softly)
Whoa Whoa Daddy

Grimsrud takes the troopers hat off of Carls lap and sails
it out the open window

GRIMSRUD
Youll take care of it Boy you
are smooth smooth you know

CARL
Whoa Daddy

Jean for some reason screams again Then stops

GRIMSRUD
Clear him off the road

CARL
Yeah

He gets out

EXT ROAD

Carl leans down to hoist up the body
Headlights appear an oncoming car
INT CIERA

Grimsrud notices

EXT ROAD

The car approaches slowing

Carl with the troopers body hoisted halfway up is frozen
in the headlights

The car accelerates and roars past and away We just make
out the silhouettes of two occupants in front

INT CIERA

Grimsrud slides into the drivers seat He squeals into a U-
turn the drivers door slamming shut with his spin

Small red tail lights fishtail up ahead The pursued car
churns up fine snow

Grimsrud takes the cigarette from his mouth and stubs it in
his ashtray We hear the churning of the car wheels and the
pinging of snow clods and salt on the cars underside

In the back seat Jean starts screaming

Grimsrud is not gaining on the tail lights

He fights with the wheel as his car swims on the road face
The red tail lights ahead start to turn With a distant
crunching sound they disappear

The headlights now show only empty road starting to turn
Grimsrud frowns and slows

His headlights show the car up ahead off the road crumpled
around a telephone pole having failed to hold a turn

Grimsrud brakes
Jean slides off the back seat and thumps into the legwell

Grimsrud sweeps his gun off the front seat throws open his
door and gets out

EXT ROAD
The wrecked cars headlights shine off into a snowfield
abutting the highway A young man in a down parka is

limping across the snowfield away from the wrecked car

Grimsrud strides calmly out after the injured boy He
raises his gun and fires

With a poof of feathers a hole opens up in the boys back
and he pitches into the snow

Grimsrud walks up to the wreck and peers in its half-open
door

A young woman is trapped inside the twisted wreckage
injured

Snow swirls in the headlights of the wreck
Grimsrud raises his gun and fires
AN OIL PAINTING

A blue-winged teal in flight over a swampy marshland The
room in which it hangs is dark We hear off-screen snoring

We track off to reveal an easel upon which we see a half-
completed oil of a grey mallard

The continuing track reveals a couple in bed sleeping The
man fortyish pajama-clad is big and big-bellied His
mouth is agape He snores His arms are flung over a woman
in her thirties wearing a nightie mouth also open not
snoring

We hold for a long beat on their regular breathing and

with dealer plates is pulling into the drive

Grimsrud climbs out of the passenger seat as Carl climbs out
of the drivers Grimsrud opens the back door and with an
arm on her elbow helps Jean out She has her hands tied
behind her and a black hood over her head

With a cry she swings her elbow out of Grimsruds grasp and
lurches away across the front lawn Grimsrud moves to
retrieve her but Carl grinning lays a hand on his
shoulder

They both look out at the front lawn Grimsrud
expressionless Carl smiling

With muffled cries the hooded woman lurches across the
unbroken snow staggering this way and that stumbling on

the uneven terrain

She stops stands still her hooded head swaying
She lurches out in an arbitrary direction Going downhill
she reels staggers and falls face-first into the snow
weeping

ROAD

Carls car roars into frame violently swirling the snow
Its red tail lights fishtail away

FADE OUT
HOLD IN BLACK
HARD CUT TO BRIGHT - LOOKING THROUGH A WINDSHIELD

It is a starky sunny day We are cruising down a street of
humble lookalike houses

We pan right as we draw toward one house in particular In
its driveway a man in a hooded parka shovels snow He
notices the approaching car and gives its driver a wave

The driver is Gary the Brainderd police officer He gives
a finger-to-the-head salute and pulls over

OUTSIDE

Gary slams his door shut and the other man plants his shovel
in the snow

MAN
How ya doin

GARY
Mr Mohra

MAN
Yah

GARY

Officer Olson

MAN
Yah right-o

The two men caucus the driveway without shaking hands and
without standing particularly close They stand stiffly
arms down at their sides and breath streaming out of their
parka hoods Each has an awkward leaning-away posture head
drawn slightly back and chin tucked in to keep his face
from protruding into the cold

MAN
So Im tendin bar there at
Ecklund andand Swedlins last Tuesday
and this little guys drinkin

and he says So where can a guy
find some action - Im goin crazy

CLOSE ON CARL SHOWALTER
In his car now parked one hand holding the rag pressed to

his mangled jaw He is staring down at something in the
front seat next to him
His other hand holds open the briefcase It has money
inside - a lot of money

Carl unfreezes takes out one of the bank-wrapped wads and
looks at it

CARL
Mmmnphh

He paws through the money in the briefcase to get a feeling
for the amount

CARL
Jeshush Shrist Jeshush
fuchem Shrist

Excited he counts out a bundle of bills and tosses it onto
the back seat

He starts to take the rag away from his chin but the layer
pressed against his face sticks its loose weave bound to
his skin by clotted blood

He pulls very gently and winces as blood starts to flow
again

He carefully tears the rag in half so that only a bit of it
remains adhering to his jaw

EXT CAR

It is pulled over to the side of an untraveled road THe
door opens and Carl emerges with the briefcase

He slogs through the snow down a gulley and up the
embankment to a barbed-wire fence He kneels at one of the
fence posts and frantically digs into the snow with his bare
hands throws in the briefcase and covers it back up

He stands and tries to beat the circulation back into his
red frozen hands

He looks to the right

A regular line of identical fence posts stretches away
against unblemished white

He looks to the left

A regular line of identical fence posts stretches away
against unblemished white
He looks at the fence post in front of him

CARL
Mmmphh

He looks about the snowy vastness for a marker Finding
none he kicks the fence post a couple of times failing to
scar or tilt it then hurriedly plants a couple of sicks up
against the post

He bends down scoops up a handful of snow presses it
against his wounded jaw and lopes back to the idling car

onto a form Beneath the form is a piece of carbon paper
and beneath that another form copy which Jerry periodically
checks The carbon-copy form shows thick smudgy illegible

Jerry has the parka slung over one arm and the galoshes
pinched in his hand

JERRY
Aw what the Christ

He stamps out the door
Marge stares

After a long moment her stare breaks She glances idly
around the office

There is a framed picture facing away from her on the
desktop She turns it to face her It is Scotty holding
an accordion There is another picture of Jean

Marge looks at it looks around for some reason at the
ceiling

She looks at a trophy shelf on the wall behind her

She fiddles idly with a pencil She pulls a clipboard
toward her It holds a form from the General Motors Finance
Corporation

She looks idly around Her look abruptly locks

MARGE
Oh for Petes sake

Jerry is easing his car around the near corner of the
building

Marges voice is flat with dismay

MARGE
Oh for Petes sake

She grabs the phone and punches in a number

MARGE

GAEAR GRIMSRUD

He sits eating a Swansons TV dinner from a TV tray he has
set up in front of an easy chair

He watches the old black-and-white TV set whose image - it
might be a game show - is still heavily ghosting and
diffused by snow The audio crackles with interference
Despite the impenetrability of its image it holds
Grimsruds complete attention

At the sound of the front door opening Grimsrud looks up

Carl enters his face suppurating and raw

He reacts to Grimsruds wordless look with a grotesque
laugh

CARL

we see the cabin door opening Carl turns reacting to the

sound

Grimsrud is bounding out wearing mittens and a red hunters
cap but no overcoat He is holding an ax

Carl fumbles in his pocket for his gun
Grimsrud swings overhand burying the ax in Carls neck

ROAD EXTERIOR

Marge pulls her prowler over some distance past the cabin
She gets out zips up her khaki parka and pulls up its fur-
lined hood

For a moment she stands listening to the muffled roar of
the power tool Then with one curved arm half pressing
against half supporting her belly she takes slow gingerly
steps down the slope through the deep snow through the
trees angling toward the cabin and the source of the
grinding noise

She slogs from tree to tree letting each one support her
downhill-leaning weight for a moment before slogging to the
next

The roar grows louder Marge stands panting by one tree
her breath vaporizing out of her snorkel hood She squints
down toward the cabins back lot

A tall man with his back to us wearing a red plaid quilted
jacket and a hunting cap with earflaps is laboring over a
large power tool which his body blocks from view

Marge advances

The man is forcing downward something which engages the
roaring power tool and makes harsh spluttering noises

The man is Grimsrud his nose red and eyes watering from the
cold hatflaps pulled down over his ears His breath steams
as he sourly goes about his work both hands pressing down a
shod foot as it if were the shaft of a butter churn

The roar is very loud

Marge slogs down to the next tree panting looking

Grimsrud forces more of the leg into the machine which we
can now see sprays small wet chunks out the bottom

Marges eyes shift
A large dark form lies in the snow next to Grimsrud
Grimsrud works on eyes watering With a grunt he bends

down out of frame and then re-enters holding a thick log
He uses it to force the leg deeper into the machine
Marge is advancing She holds a gun extended toward
Grimsrud who is still turned away

Grimsrud rubs his nose with the back of his hand
Marge closes in grimacing

Grimsruds back strains as he puts his weight into the log
that pushes down into the machine

The dark shape in the snow next to his side is the rest of
Carl Showalters body

Marge has drawn to within twenty yards When she bellows it
sounds hollow and distant her voice all but eaten up by the
roar of the power tool
MARGE

Stop Police Turn around and

hands up
Startled Grimsrud scowls He turns to face her
He stares

Marge bellows again

MARGE
Hands up

Conscious of the noise she shows with a twist of her
shoulder the armpatch insignia

MARGE
Police

Grimsrud stares

With a quick twist he reaches back for the log hurls it at
Marge and then starts running away

Marge twists her body sideways shielding herself

No need - the heavy log travels perhaps ten yards and lands
in the snow several feet short of her

Grimsrud pants up the hill - slow going through the deep
snow

Behind him
MARGE
Halt

She fires in the air
She lowers the gun and carefully sighs

MARGE
Halt

She fires
Grimsrud still slogs up the hill - a miss
Marge sights again

MARGE
Halt

She fires again

Grimsrud pitches forward He mutters in Swedish as he
reaches down to clutch at his wounded leg

Marge walks toward him gun trained on him as her other hand
reaches under her parka and gropes around her waist

It comes out with a pair of handcuffs which she opens with
a snap of the wrist

MARGE
All right buddy On your
belly and your hands clasped
behind you

THE CRUISER

Marge drives Grimsrud sits in the back seat hands cuffed
behind him

For a long moment there he is quiet - only engine hum and
the periodic clomp of wheels on pavement seams - as Marge
grimly shakes her head

MARGE
So that was Mrs Lundegaard
in there

She glances up in the rear-view mirror

Grimsrud cheeks sunk eyes hollow looks sourly out at the
road
Marge shakes her head
At length

MARGE
I guess that was your

accomplice in the wood chipper

Grimsruds head bobs with bumps on the road

otherwise he is

motionless reactionless scowling and gazing out

MARGE

And those three people in

Brainerd

No response

Marge gazing forward seems to be talking to herself

MARGE

And for what For a little

bit of money
We hear distant sirens

MARGE

Theres more to life than money

you know

She glances up in the rear-view mirror

MARGE
Dont you know that

And

here ya are and its a beautiful

day

Grimsruds hollow eyes stare out

The sirens are getting louder Marge pulls over

MARGE
Well

She leans forward to the dash to give two short signalling

WHOOPS on her siren

She turns on her flashers

She leans back with a creak and jangle of utilities

She stares forward shakes her head

We hear the dull click
of her flashers

MARGE
I just dont unnerstand it

Outside it is snowing The sky the earth the road - all
white

A squad car gumballs spinning punches through the white
It approaches in slow motion

An ambulance punches through after it
Another squad car

FADE OUT

FADE IN
HIGH AND WIDE ON A SHABBY MOTEL

It stands next to a highway on a snowy windslept plain
One or two cars dot the parking lot along with an idling
police cruiser

MOTEL ROOM DOORWAY

We are looking over the shoulders of two uniformed policemen
who stand on either side of the door their hands resting
lightly on their holstered sidearms One of them raps at
the door

COP ONE
Mr Anderson

A title fades in OUTSIDE OF BISMARK NORTH DAKOTA
After a pause muffled through the door

VOICE
Who

COP ONE
Mr Anderson is this your burgundy
88 out here

VOICE
Just a sec

COP ONE
Could you open the door please
VOICE
Yah Yah just a sec

We hear a clatter from inside

VOICE
Just a sec

One of the policemen unholsters his gun and nods to someone
whose back enters - a superintendent holding a ring of keys
This man turns a key in the door and then stands away

The two policemen guns at the ready bang into the motel
room

The rough hand-held camera rushes in behind them as the two
men give the room a two-handed sweep with their guns

The room is empty
Cop one indicates the open bathroom door

COP ONE
Dale

The two men charge the bathroom belts jingling guns at the
ready jittery camera behind them rushing to keep pace

A man in boxer shorts is halfway out the bathroom window

The policemen holster their guns and charge the window and
drag Jerry Lundegaard back into the room

His flesh quivers as he thrashes and keens in short
piercing screams

The cops wrestle him to the floor but his palsied thrashing
continues The policemen struggle to restrain him

COP ONE
Call an ambulance

COP TWO
You got him okay

Cop One pinions Jerrys arms to the floor and Jerry bursts
into uncontrolled sobbing

COP ONE
Yah yah call an ambulance
Jerry sobs and screams
A BEDROOM
We are square on Norm who sits in bed watching television

After a long beat Marge enters frame in a nightie and
climbs into bed with some effort

MARGE
Oooph

Norm reaches for her hand as both watch the television
At length Norm speaks but keeps his eyes on the TV

NORM
They announced it

Marge looks at him

MARGE
They announced it

NORM
Yah

Marge looks at him waiting for more but Norms eyes stay
fixed on the television

MARGE
So

NORM
Three-cent stamp

MARGE
Your mallard

NORM
Yah

MARGE

Norm thats terrific
Norm tries to suppress a smile of pleasure

NORM
Its just the three cent

MARGE

NORM
Hautmans blue-winged teal got the
twenty-nine cent People dont
much use the three-cent

MARGE
Oh for Petes - a course they do

stamps

NORM

NORM

MARGE

Her eyes go back to the TV

MARGE

Norm murmurs

NORM

MARGE

Both of them are watching the TV as Norm reaches out to rest
a hand on top of her stomach

NORM

Marge absently rests her own hand on top of his

MARGE
Two more months

Hold fade out
