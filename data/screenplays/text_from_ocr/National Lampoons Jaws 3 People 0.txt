John appears from his hidey hole the Javelin on his
shoulder He fires it up

PLUNK The Javelin coughs out a massive heat-seeking warhead
thirty feet out it ROARS to life spewing out a sheet of
flame SCREAMING across the ravine at mach 3

NORTH JANE is transfixed With no option she drops off the
ledge into the freezing darkness

The next millisecond the rocket slams into the snow-face The
snow explodes with WITHERING FORCE throwing up a hundred
foot ball of flame and causing an avalanche

A CLOUD OF DUST swallows the screen Then BLACKNESS

A beat And John emerges coughing BY THE ROADSIDE Through
the haze we can see a THIRTY-CAR PILE-Up ON THE BRIDGE It
looks like a CAR GRAVEYARD

Moving across the highway John reaches the median where he
sees Jane a small figure emerging from the avalanche snow
pile down the road She heads into a tunnel John pursues

INT TUNNEL - NIGHT

Lit with the crackle and flash of downed electricity cables
John enters a service corridor off the main tunnel

John looks around No sign of the figure Then suddenly a
SHADOW drops down BEHIND him from above JANE’s eyes blaze
through the darkness as she attacks like a tiger

A graceful spin and John’s down from a reverse spinning
roundhouse He goes for a gun but she hooks his hand between
her ankles in mid-air FLIPPING him sending the gun flying

John tastes blood raises his fists They circle each other
Feints sudden moves Black belt vs Golden Gloves Testing
for weaknesses Ju jitsu kicks at ankles knees John throws
punch after punch getting closer She dodges but can’t stop
his onslaught She drops cracks both his shins with a half-
brick He gasps in pain and falls to his knees

Moving behind him she executes a neck hold drags him towards
a ragged steel pole sticking out of a discarded road sign

John is choking Jane pushes him towards the sharp metal
point inches from his eye John spots his gun five feet
away Reaches behind and grabs the crotch of Jane’s pants
Squeezes No effect What

He twists his shoulders and relaxes his arms They both fall
towards the spike but John angles himself missing it and
SLASHING THE BACK OF JANE’S SHOULDER She gasps in pain

Suddenly free John crawls towards his gun He spins and
aims Nothing He looks around the silent darkness Turns on
his head lamp something disappears back into the tunnel

He is met by the blinding light of a NIGHT SUN and the wind
and noise of A CHOPPER He just catches a glimpse of his
adversary on a ROPE LADDER swinging under the huey before the
CHOPPER opens fire with a minigun forcing him back into the
tunnel

THE CHOPPER WHEELS AND FLIES OFF UP THE RAVINE

EXT THE RAVINE - DAY

The Bald eagle soars in a blue sky

Light snow People clear the road with digging equipment
Eighty feet above John stands combing the ground with a
metal detector Suddenly we hear BEEP He stops dead Steps
backwards BEEP

John falls to his knees and starts digging with his hands
Soon he uncovers a corner of the laptop Jane dropped

JOHN
Oho what do we have here

He opens the laptop

JOHN (CONTD)
Come to Daddy
John taps a single key and a smiley face pops up PLEASE
ENTER PIN CODE His frown deepens when ten cartoon
fingers start counting down The smiley face changes to a
frowny face and on zero puts its fingers in its ears

The laptop explodes in a fireball which knocks John on his
back John looks up nervously at the snow above

compresses further They breath in Claustrophobia The
ceiling stops dead

John and Jane lay on their backs Side by side Their noses
touching the top of the bin Trapped

John tries to pull his gun CLANG His gun is in the OUTSIDE
HAND No room The other hand flicks out his punch dagger
Jane spots this grabs his hand and applies locking pressure
to John’s wrist He gasps in pain and drops the dagger which
she retrieves and flips around in her fingers

With no room to defend himself John thinks fast and PUSHES
his entire body against hers jamming her arms by her sides
against the walla Body to body

he aims BEHIND her And whispers

JOHN
Biggest on the block

BANG He shoots her CHRISTMAS TREE SPLITTING its trunk
TIMBERR It tips falling STRAIGHT AT JANE

She leaps away Onto a broken chair Exposed John FIRES
BLASTS the chair Jane falls Her gun SLIPS OUT OF HER HAND

As John rolls out Jane eyes move desperately She RIPS a
string of Christmas lights off the ground And SNAPS
Lashing Johns hand His gun flies across the room

John and Jane lunge in opposite directions Toward each
others guns John grabs Janes Jane grabs Johns And they
spin to see

A GUN IN THEIR EYE FACE OFF The Moment of Truth

Dust and debris waft around them Trigger fingers tighten
They circle each other Their eyes locked HAMMERS COCKED

And CRACK A frame falls On instinct they GLANCE And see
ragged photos and mementoes strewn everywhere Their life
stares out at them Their home They lock eyes again

Eyeball to eyeball Real raw point blank Something about
the way John looks at Jane is different emotional off

Time freezes The barrel shakes on his gun

John looks into his wifes eyes And he cannot pull the
trigger So he slowlylowershisbarrel

Jane blinks sweat out of her eyes Confused suspicious Her
eyes flit fast looking for tricks But what she sees is

Old photos Knick-knacks A lifetime of memories Young John
and Jane stare out at her She blinks hard STRUGGLING
Starting to crack And slowlyher trigger finger
LOOSENS CLICK Shedrops her gun

AND LUNGESINTOA KISS

John and Jane COLLIDE All of the tension and thrill of the
chase POUR into this kiss Their hands move fast Hungry
desperate They slide to the ground We TILT UP to finda
battered piece of mistletoe swaying in the breeze FADE OUT

Jesus Christ who are you I mean
do I even know your name
(a beat realizing)
Wait seriously do I know your
name Jane

She turns to him Doesn’t answer That’s a “no”

JANE
Hector Danz

She lights up A drag

JANE (CONTD)
His name’s Hector Danz He was an
accountant for the CIA Ran all the
books for freelance hitters They
were using independents like us
on domestic targets

Another drag John just stares at her

JANE (CONTD)
FBI was onto the operation They
got Hectors books convinced him
to testifyagainst the man who
runs our chapter Names Mr
Horner And hes got access to the
top fifty hitters in the United
States Who are all after us now

A beat John stares at Jane Dealing
JOHN

you were in there for like fifteen
seconds Howd you get all that

She puffs

JANE
I can be very convincing

He shakes his head Digesting Jane remains dark
JANE (CONTD)
John Hector and the books are 4

package deal Without the books
weve got nothing

John shrugs No problem

JOHN
So lets get the books

JANE
Great idea
(looking at John)
Except you blew them up at the
courthouse

John opens his mouth Nothing escapes A beat

JOHN
SoHectoris

JANE
Worthless

A hard beat Stinging

JOHN
So weve got nothing to trade

Jane takes a long drag Smoke rises

JANE
Except each other Theyre not
going to stop till one of us is
dead

An impossible beat Trapped With insurmountable odds John
searches for a solution Quiet resolved Finally

JOHN
Well then I guess we’ve gotta take
them out
Jane looks back at him
JANE
That’s your answer You want to
take out an army of assassins

JOHN
What

JANE
Its justit’s just so typical

JOHN
What does that mean

She looks at him

JANE
It means why don’t you stop and
think for a second

JOHN
I am thinking

JANE
No Youre attacking Youre always
attacking John

JOHN
Always

JANE
Always Its who you are

JOHN
How would you know
(a hanging beat)
Honey six days ago you thought I
was in fucking construction

Jane looks at him A penetrating glance

JANE
I’m not talking about your job Im
talking about you And you always
blow up what you cant fix

John roils emotional

JOHN
Where is this coming from

JANE
Where is this coming from How
about the fact that you fired a
ballistic missile at me You shot
up our wagon You tried to run me
over with a monster truck
(a beat real)
All you do is wreck things

JOHN
And you think youre so much
better Your neat little boxes
Everything tagged and filed What
happened to my car

JANE
You ran it into the river While
trying to attack me

JOHN
You slipped out of the house Not
me Thats you Always avoiding
things

JANE
John I didnt blow up the one
thing that could save us

JOHN
Jane It wasnt my idea to get
Hector

JANE

So this is my fault This is my
fault now

JOHN

(snapping)
No it’s my fault It’s all my
fault It’s my fault we met Its
my fault we moved in And it’s
definitely my fault we got married

Fuck Right away he wishes he could take the last sentence
back But it’s too late It’s out there Jane hardens

JANE
No John That was both our faults

A hard beat On the edge of the dark highway John stands
frustrated He wants to stop the bleeding

JOHN
Look Husbands and wives lie to
each other all the time It doesn’t
mean they don’t know each other

JANE
Doesnt it

A beat A challenge
JANE (CONTD)

So tell me one thing that’s true
One thing you really mean

ill

She needs something meaningful here John opens his mouth
But nothing comes out He doesn’t know what to say Jane
shakes her head disappointed

JANE (CONTD)
You were right I don’t know you
at all

She turns around A beat Miles away John searches Finds

JOHN
I’m sorry

Hold on John And we CUT TO-
INT ANONYMOUS ROOM
A phone rings A hand picks up

VOICE

JANE (ON PHONE)

VOICE
Your contract has been rescinded

JANE (ON PHONE)
I have a package for the Boss
Something he wants

VOICE
(a beat)
Where would you like to make
delivery
JANE
Somewhere public covered no clean
shots

VOICE (ON PHONE)
Name it

EXT MOTEL - PAYPHONE ON HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Jane hangs up No sign of John She looks at the horizon The
sun rises blood red A cold wind blows Jane drops her
cigarette and stomps it out Hard

And we CUT TO AN EPIC SWEEPING AERIAL SHOT OF

EXT IKEA SUPERSTORE -— DAY
See the Christmas shoppers Smell the new paint And enter-
INT IKEA SUPERSTORE DAY

John enters ALONE His eyes shift from customer to customer
Potential assassins everywhere That guy over there looking
at the bunkbeds The couple paying for garden furniture

John walks slow Wary Eyes shifting Hands running through
soft furnishings And then

VOICE (0S)
Mr Smith

John turns to face MR HORNER a very ordinary man carrying a
very ordinary basket of goods He smiles broadly Terrifying

JOHN
Mr Horner

His smile tightens realizing John knows his name Johns
eyes keep moving checking the customers sightlines

MR HORNER
Looking for your wife

A hanging beat

MR HORNER (CONTD)
She tell you shed take the back
route Meet you in the middle

John stays quiet He looks at Mr Horner That scary smile

MR HORNER (CONTD)
I don’t think she‘’ll be joining us
Except to pick up her payment

JOHN
What are you talking about

MR HORNER
We always knew she was the better
hitter Of course it took her a
little longer than usual to clean
the scene this time But at least
she finished what she started

John looks gutpunched His eyes scanning He sees the store
filled with suspicious moves bulges Quiet

JOHN
Looks like the gang’s all here
Mr Horner smiles nods good-naturedly

MR HORNER
You know I had a wife once

He trails off We can only imagine what happened to his wife
JOHN
How much How much did she get for
serving me up

Mr Horner pats a BAG in his basket

MR HORNER
Class one contract John

John shakes his head digesting Horner gives a cruel smile
MR HORNER (CONTD)
Dont tell me you thought this
would all have a happy ending
John looks up Intense Remembering Jane’s words

JOHN
Happy endingsare just stories

VOICE (0S)
That haven’t finished yet

And we seeJANE steps out from behind Mr Horner He turns
a little surprised to see her Johns eyes remain level
giving away no emotion nothing

JOHN
Perfect timing Jane

JANE
Perfect as always

Mr Horner keeps his eyes on Jane

MR HORNER
You here to collect early

He motions to the bag She takes it

JANE
Yes I am

She opens the bag checking the cash

MR HORNER
Any last words John

John keeps his eyes on Jane A flicker ofconnection

JOHN
In light of the seriousness of the
situation and since I may not have
the chance later I want you to
know I married you because I loved
you

Jane looks at John

JANE
Likewise I wanted what I wanted
and I lied I apologize

Mr Horner looks slightly confused His smile creases

JOHN
Me too Also youre the only girl
I ever loved Nobody made me feel
the way you did before all the
whatnot got in the way

JANE
Ditto Guy with the trolley

Okay now Mr Horner is seriously confused What the fuck is
going on He looks back and forth between John and Jane

(

JOHN

Got him Couple by the lamps
JANE

Check
JOHN

So You ready
AndJane steps BESIDE JOHN Facing Mr Horner together

JANE
Yeah I’m ready

Mr Horners smile finally fades Dead serious

MR HORNER
If this is some kind of plan it
can’t possibly work

JOHN
No it’s not a plan See we tried
to come up with a clever plan But
we couldnt agree on anything

JANE
We had a few ideas but they never
really gelled into anything

There is something different about their bickering now A
rhythm As if they are in on the same joke Their eyes keep
moving casing The customers slowly shift positions

JOHN
(buying time)
I thought maybe we should all meet
at the Wollman Memorial

MR HORNER
What are you talking about

JANE
The ice rink in Central Park From
all the movies

JOHN
But turns out Jane can’t skate
(to Jane)
Guy on the forklift

Jane sees the forklift She continues Eyes moving Riffing

JANE
Then John wanted to meet and stage
our deaths in front of the Statue
of Liberty
(to John)
Shooter on the shelves

JOHN
But Jane said you’d probably kill
us soon as we got there

JANE
And it is the ending of The Sting

Mr Horner loses patience

MR HORNER
SHUT UP

John and Jane look at Mr Horner He gathers himself

MR HORNER (CONTD)
Do you have any idea how many times
youre outnumbered here

JOHN
Well see we didn’t before But we
do now

MR HORNER

So you know for a fact you’re not
walking out of here alive

JOHN
That‘s more than possible Wouldnt
you say honey

JANE
More than possible I’d say
“likely”

FATHER
I don’t understand What on earth
made you think it would work

They look at each other Shrug

JOHN
This is us you know This is what
we do

The Truth They look back

JANE
Plus we have very very big balls

Without turning

JOHN
See you in the next life Jane

JANE
Likewise John

Jane pulls a gun and time turns to syrup John throws the bag
into the air covering Jane’s head She FIRES at the BAG 50
money explodes into the air buying them precious cover

A TELESCOPIC SIGHT SHOT is obscured by the cloud of bills
Mr Horner steps away disappearing down the aisle

A fully armed TEAM sit up in the KIDDIE FOAM BALL PIT where
they had been hiding They OPEN FIRE on Jane and John

Jane aims at a man drawing his gun and blows him backwards
off his feet The MAN ON THE TOILET get off one shot at them
before John takes him out John and Jane SMASH through the
paint cans into the massive shelving unit

They roll GRENADES across the floor spewing colored smoke
Another grenade spins further out As Killers swarm the area
the grenade goes off with a flash BANG A percussion
grenade It takes out the four nearest guys

John and Jane now inside the shelving unit crouch-run
behind the paint cans as shots rain in SPATTERING them with
multi-colored PAINTS They roll out into the opposite aisle

John skids across the floor on his back FIRING continuously
DROPPING two agents with rifles Jane covers the other angle
FIRING at multiple targets pouring into her end of the aisle

The aisles are working in their favor they only have two
directions to cover Back-to-back they BLAST their way
through a chipboard wardrobe into another shelving unit where
they fluidly reload under cover as they spin into the next
aisle Swapping directions they cover opposite angles

Agents pour into each end of the aisle but they have no
cover Jane and John work through them methodically spewing
hot lead raining brass casings More and more Agents appear

But Jane and John have found an unstoppable RHYTHM Like Fred
and Ginger

(

Covering each other reloading under shelves crossing into
aisle after aisle covering each other again and again

The Agents quickly realize they are at a disadvantage on this
terrain They hang back FIRING more carefully John and Jane
have to be more careful now more observant Reacting to the
smallest movements They burst out of the warehouse area and
into the SHOWROOM

EFerily John and Jane move through living room mock ups
kitchens stalking through studies and immaculate bedrooms
Like a MAZE they encounter Agents round corners firing at
John and Jane from hidden vantage points

Two Agents are dug into a BATHROOM laying down fire The
cover is more readily available here the ground broken John
and Janes progress is slowed in a mock-up of the ideal
suburban LIVING ROOM They continue to shoot it out

JANE (CONTD)
Ammo

JOHN
Low Can’t get stuck here We need
to reinforce

Two Agents incoming Jane gets low grabbing CHRISTMAS
LIGHTS off a pillar whipping out the lights SWEEPING the
Agents to their feet As they fall she snatches their guns
She tosses the reinforcements to John On the move

JANE
The other side of that wall
through soft furnishings and were
home free

John looks at his wife fucking impressed They jump up and
lay down a withering FIRE on the bathroom which gets blown
to bits One agent ICED the other dives into the BATHTUB

John and Jane run through the final few rooms and into SOFT
FURNISHINGS It seems quiet Too quiet Suddenly a SHOT hits
John in the leg and he goes down Jane drops with him

They hit the deck and start CRAWLING through acres of beds in
rows Jane pops up and takes out the shooter through a
venetian blind She looks to John You okay

John nods and they’re off crawling under beds popping up now
and again to look around

TWELVE AGENTS run inte the section They split up and stalk
through the beds

Suddenly John pops up and takes one out Just as they react
Jane pops up on the other side twenty feet away and drops
another They attempt to react to Jane but John pops up
twenty feet further on and HITS again It‘s impossible to
tell where John and Jane are The remaining agents hit the
deck adopting the Smiths technique and

A game of deadly hide-and-seek ensues in the WORLDS LARGEST
BEDROOM

More Agents spill into the room No one seems to be able to
locate where or when the Smiths will pop up next John and
Jane separate They shoot and fight their way toward the
door Taking guns off fallen enemies for ammo Their progress
seems inexorable A bloodbath

Then Silence Panting they both listen No sounds of
life They are the only two people left in the world

John and Jane siowly stand up and walk out John leans on
Jane for support As they pass Mr Horner without looking

JANE (CONTD)
Were the only game left in town

JOHN
You know where to find us

EXT IKEA - DAY

In glow motion John and Jane both streaked with blood and
colored paint walk out of IKEA weapons still drawn They
pass SHOPPERS cowering behind cars Kids cry People pray

A WOMAN runs out in front of them trying to get to her car
John lazily raises his gun but Jane touches his arm It’s OR
Shes real He lowers it A nuclear FAMILY are on their
faces behind their Range Rover

John and Jane get in their car and slowly drive away As they
head into the hills we hear the swell of SIRENS And

A convoy of CARS speeds toward IKEA We recognize the FBI
sedans And

INT IKEA SUPERSTORE - DAY
CRUNCH FBI AGENTS in flak-jackets swarm the store Guns out
Familiar faces They see the FORTY KILLERS layed out With

Christmas wreathes and blinking lights strewn everywhere the
bodies almost look likeChristmas presents

We hear BING CROSBY back on the radio A modern version in--
EXTINT CAR -— DAY

John and Jane drive away Jane at the wheel She reaches
over and puts her hand on Johns hand Blood mingling

DR WEXLER (VO)
So I’m pleased to see you back here
as a couple

INT DOCTOR WEXLER‘S OFFICE - DAY
John and Jane sit next to each other on the love seat

DR WEXLER

bad points

JANE

JOHN

gay weve brought a whole new level
of honesty to our relationship

JANE
We realized we were depriving each
other of whe we really were

JOHN

theresthere’s

JANE
room for us to grow to become
more like us rather than shrinking
into some idea of who we should be

DR WEXLER
You know a lot of couples Tf meet
the biggest block is trust

JANE
You know that is so true

DR WEXLER
