THE GONG SHOW

Chuck Barris is being sniffed in the crotch by a large dog
The audience howls with glee Suddenly the video image
explodes Slow motion sparks and shards of glass shoot

toward the camera We pull back to reveal were in a
darkened messy hotel room We pan across the walls past
taped-up yellowed newspaper clippings with headlines like
Gong Show a New Low in Television The Dumbing of
America and Chuck Barris is the Decline of Western
Civilization We come to rest on a naked middle-aged man
crouching in the shadows in the corner holding a gun This
is Chuck Barris The television continues to sputter spark
and smoke There is a knock at the door

BARRIS
(mumbly)
Fuck Shit Piss

Naked Barris still holding the gun seems panicked He
hesitates trying to determine his options Should he answer
the door Should he climb out onto the window ledge

Finally he creeps to the door and peeks out the peephole for
a long moment He unlocks the door opens it The sweaty
young man a bellhop stands there with his many bags

He tries to appear casual as takes in the sight a naked
Chuck Barris holding a gun an exploded smoking tv set in
the background

BARRIS (CONTD)
(weakly)
More stuff

BELLHOP

DH-10 directional fragmentation mine

BARRIS

hall then motions for the bellhop to enter The bellhop
places the bags on a table fishes in his pocket and pulls
out some bills

BARRIS (CONTD)

Suddenly Barris becomes agitated

BARRIS

(runs to the mirror)
Its the not sleeping Im not sleeping

Barris trails off There is a pause The bellhop attempts
to make conversation

BELLHOP
(re exploded tv)
Um another Gong Show rerun sir

The naked Barris approaches the bellhop drapes his arm over
the young mans shoulder and walks with him

BARRIS

(conspiratorially)
You know what Id do -- And dont tell
anybody -- Id rub Id rub Alpo brand
dog food on my dick so the dogs would
stick their noses into my dick
Guaranteed big laugh right That was my
trick my great contribution to the
world How wouldnt I degrade myself I
ask you

There is a silence

BARRIS (CONTD)
(screaming)
I ask you
BELLHOP
I I I dont know sir

Suddenly Barris punches himself in the head flops down on
the unmade bed The bellhop glances at Barriss bare ass
looks away

BELLHOP (CONTD)

the show every night you wouldnt have
to --

BARRIS
I always pay for the damn tvs dont I
(turning to face him)

BELLHOP
Its -- Yes you do sir and we
appreciate that -- Its just that

thereve been complaints from some of the
other guests and Mr Andrews the
assistant manager requested that I --

BARRIS
Still Complaints I specifically used
the silencer this time Specifically

BELLHOP
Well the people in 917 found a bullet
lodged in their wall And while we want
to accommodate you -- we certainly value
your patronage -- there is an issue of
customer safety

Barris lets this sink in

BARRIS

Yes of course

Barris finds his pants draped over a chair pulls out his
wallet holds some more money out to the bellhop

BARRIS (CONTD)
My apologies Buy -- 917 is it -- buy
them a magnum of your finest champagne
And and your finest spackle Oh and
get me a bag of plastic army men while

youre out I forgot to tell you before

The bellhop sighs takes the money

BELLHOP
Thank you for your understanding sir

The bellhop exists

BARRIS
(calling after)
And some black socks Seven black socks
you rascule

Barris locks the door dumps the contents of the bags onto
the floor fishes through the mess for a cigar puts the
cigar in his mouth studies himself in a full length mirror

BARRIS (CONTD)

Bellhop Johnson was clearly repulsed by
the sight of me And why not Im
wrinkled
(searches for simile then
proudly)

like a prune Covered in liver
spots
(searches for simile)

like an old guy My hair is falling
out in clumps leaving exposed patches of
white sickly scalp A flabby inner-tube
of fat hangs from my waist practically
obscuring my bedraggled prick -- dark and
shriveled and dead Still leaking urine
even though I left the toilet ages ago
My asshole itches Hemorrhoids abound
George Orwell said every man has the face
he deserves by fifty Does every man

have the asshole he deserves by fifty as
well Does every fifty year old asshole
have the asshole he deserves

EXT TERRACE - DAY

This feels real verite The actual Chuck Barris smoking a
cigar is being interviewed He stands outside his villa in
St Tropez older than the middle-aged Barris depicted in the
hotel room and talks to someone off-camera

ACTUAL BARRIS
It was 1981 I had holed myself up in
this New York hotel Parker Hotel
Terrified of everything Ashamed of my
life

INTERVIEWER (0C)
Ashamed What do you mean

Barris walks through a small vegetable garden as he talks
occasionally adjusting a stake or pulling out a weed

ACTUAL BARRIS
When youre young your potential is
infinite You might do anything really
You might be great You might be
Einstein You might be Goethe Then you
get to an age where what you might be
gives way to what you have been You
werent Einstein You werent anything
Thats a bad moment But I remembered
something Carlyle wrote there is no
life of a man faithfully recorded but
is a heroic poem of its sort rhymed or
unrhymed I realized my salvation might
be in recording my wasted life
unflinchingly Maybe it would serve as a
cautionary tale Maybe it would help me
understand why

Barris loses himself in the crowd He hurries past a guy who

recognizes and starts chanting
PARTY MAN 2
Chuckie Baby Chuckie Baby Chuckie
Baby

Barris turns and makes his way through the crowd to the door
EXT SUNSET BLVD - NIGHT

Barris makes his way down the crowded street People stare
turn their heads to gawk We hear over and over again Hey
isnt that Chuck Barris and Hey look The Gong Show
guy and Chuckie baby Chuckie baby Barris smiles wanly
and nods People shove paper and pen in his face and he
scribbles autographs without stopping Sweat forms on his
brow His polyester shirt is drenched

BARRIS (VO)
She was right What the hell had I done
with my life

Among the fans on the street Barris spots the fat bachelor
he killed in London He sports a bullet hole in his head
Barris does a double take

BARRIS (CONTD)
Wait youre that guy Youre dead
This is screwy

FAT BACHELOR
I only want to be loved

BARRIS
Thats all I fucking wanted

Barris hurries away from the fat bachelor He begins to spot
others converging on him the corpses of those he killed
bloody and disfigured Crazy angry-looking gonged Gong Show
contestants appear in the crowd with weapons KGB agents in
trench coats and sunglasses wield guns Day of the Dead
skeletons dance after him Barris breaks into a run
Suddenly confetti and balloons pour down on him out of the
LA night sky Barris dashes across the street almost
getting hit by a car He ducks down an alley to catch his
breath As he leans against the wall and heaves a middle-
aged woman appears somewhat backlit by the street light

MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
Mr Barris
BARRIS
No Im

MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
My name is Louise Wechsler and Im here
from Tulsa with my family and

BARRIS
Please Im not feeling well

MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
Just a moment of your time I love your
show And well I sort of have a
talent myself

BARRIS
You can stop by the office to audition
tomorrow

The woman continues to approach

MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
Well Im leaving tomorrow and I was just
wondering See I dance a little and I
was just wondering --

Theres no way out of this Barris sighs

BARRIS
Yeah all right Go ahead

Barris turns to face the woman whos very close now She
starts to dance around sort of ballet-like very badly
Barris watches She pirouettes arms above her head

BARRIS (CONTD)
Very nice

Something in her hand glints in the light Barris
reflexively grabs her arm Its an ice pick The two
wrestle for it The woman is extremely strong Barris jams
the palm of his hand up into the womans nose She staggers
back but doesnt drop the ice pick Barris leaps at her
The two roll on the ground The woman pins Barris She
straddles him and is about to stab him through the air
Barris reaches under her skirt and grabs her crotch The
middle-aged woman is a man He screams in a distinctly male
voice Barris takes the moment of distraction to grab the
ice pick and jam it up through the assailants chin and into
his brain The assailant slumps over

Barris pushes the body off himself kneels beside it and
pulls off the wig He gets up shaking and heaving He
looks at the body one more time kicks it in the head with
all his might

EXT TERRACE - DAY

ACTUAL BARRIS
That was it I just disappeared The
network had to put The Gong Show into
reruns It was 1981 I holed myself up
in this hotel in New York Parker Hotel

INT HOTEL ROOM - DAY
SUBTITLE NEW YORK CITY SPRING 1982

We see Barris from above shivering and naked in the corner
The manuscript pages are piled high next to the typewriter
Barris looks up at the camera with outstretched arms
appealing to the gods

BARRIS
Who Am I

There is a pounding on the wall from a neighbor

NEIGHBOR (0S)
Who cares Shut the fuck up

Theres a knock at the door Barris crawls toward it peeks
through the peephole

BARRIS
Fuck Shit Piss
Barris unlocks the door Simon Oliver stands there
OLIVER
Barris
BARRIS

Howd you know where I was

OLIVER
Chuck Chuck Chuck dont be an
orangutan We always know where you are
We always know what youre doing By the
by Id think twice before Id attempt to
get that tripe youre writing published
And theres a typo on page --

BARRIS
Look what do you want Oliver I dont
work for you anymore I have things
to

Barris trails off

OLIVER
Id like you to come back for one last
assignment Chuck

BARRIS
No Now get Good-bye

OLIVER
I think you might be interested when I
tell you its the mole who fingered your
friends Jim Byrd and Paul Picard and
Seigfried Keeler

BARRIS
Keeler committed suicide

OLIVER
Yes of course he did He threw himself
from a twentieth floor window after he
strangled himself to death with an
electrical cord

BARRIS
(beat)
Im not interested Oliver

OLIVER
As long as the moles alive you dont
have a chance in hell of remaining so
Besides killing is in your blood old
man You fit the profile
Barris lunges at Oliver pushes him against the wall

BARRIS
That fucking profile again Whats the
fuck is it What the fuck do you
bastards know about me that I dont

OLIVER
Indeed Where to begin First let go
of me
Barris lets go Oliver sits in a chair straightens his
shirt

OLIVER (CONTD)
Lets see Well you had a twin sister
stillborn strangled by your umbilical
cord Your first hit Chuck Your
mother always wanted a daughter She
blamed you for your sisters death And
so until your sister Phoebe was born
she raised you as a girl

BARRIS
Thats not true

OLIVER
Oh and your father the dentist Not
really your father Your biological
father was a man named Edmund James
Windsor A serial killer A fact your
mother didnt know when she had an affair
with him in 1930 If you want to look
him up he was also known as the
Tarrytown Troll because he had been
described by witnesses as short and ugly
Windsor died in the electrical chair at
Ossining in 1939 We believed your self-
loathing tendencies coupled with that
extra Y chromosome and whatever else you
inherited from your father would serve us
well

BARRIS
Youre lying
OLIVER
Im trying to think what more I can tell
you Im sure theres more But you have
me at a disadvantage here Barris I
dont have your files in front of me

BARRIS
Just leave me the hell alone

OLIVER
Your mother always loved the game shows
and you so wanted to please her We
never expected the game show business to
work out for you But that it did
turned out to be in our favor I guess
your need to be a good daughter drove you
more than we anticipated

Barris lunges at Oliver The two wrestle on the floor
Barris punches him repeatedly in the face

even despise myself with any insight

PATRICIA
Insane asylums are filled with people who
think theyre Jesus or Satan Very few
have delusions of being the guy down the
block who works at an insurance company
Wonder what that means

BARRIS

Yknow I wanted to be a writer once I
wanted to write something that someday
some lesser person would quote But I
never did Im the lesser person

that wasnt said by somebody else first
I am disposable I disposed of people
