INT POLICE CAR -- NIGHT

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

From the vantage point of a cruising police car observe
this mid-sized central Californian citys quiet downtown
Look over the few pedestrians and motorists still on the
streets Linger on some with suspicion

EXT RURAL OUTSKIRTS -- NIGHT

The city in the distance now Dark streets undeveloped
land Fog drapes the trees and construction equipment

INT POLICE CAR -- NIGHT
Peer out the windshield Objects emerge from the fog

A car turns on to the road weaves momentarily out of its
lane The driver corrects the error but too late as-

A COPS HAND flips a switch The siren WAILS

EXT RURAL OUTSKIRTS -- NIGHT

The car veers towards the shoulder But instead of pulling
over the wheels CUT sharply The car completes a wild u-
turn and ZIPS past the police cruiser

EXT STREET -- NIGHT

A long stretch of unoccupied show homes -- lit up furnished
and eerily empty The quietude is shattered by-

THE TWO CARS

Slice through the fog a WHOOSH of sound and color

AT THE END OF THE STREET

The car makes a sharp left the police cruiser follows-

Up a hill to a stop sign and the fleeing car STOPS

The cop SLAMS on the brakes-

Too late The cruiser BANGS into the back of the car which
fishtails on to the muddy shoulder The COP gets out CHARGES

the car with his gun aimed at the driver who wont look up-

COP
Hands where I can see them

The SECOND COP pounds on the side of the car with his gun-

SECOND COP
Hands Show me your hands
COP

Hands now

Finally casually the driver lifts his head RICKY is in

his early 20s Latino

The cop SWINGS the door open PRESSES

his gun to Rickys temple

COP (CONTD)
Hands on the dash

Theres an electronic CHIRP The cop YANKS Ricky from the
car and a cell phone SLIPS from his grasp

The second cop grabs it its blinking TEXT MESSAGE SENT

SECOND COP
You almost got yourself shot over a

cell phone

COP
You got any weapons or needles
anything Im gonna stick myself with

RICKY
I dont have anything like that

The cop pats him down hands his partner a wallet

SECOND COP
You dont have an id

Ricky sees reflected in his cars mirror headlights

approaching

RICKY
That aint a crime aint gotta have
your papers everywhere you go It
aint 1984 yet sir

COP
You gotta have a license to drive a
car you dumb shit

SECOND COP
Whats your name

RICKY

Come on man

who I am

look at me You know

(with a big grin)
Im Supermans son

SECOND COP
This cars stolen thats something
we can handle like gentlemen easy
(MORE )
SECOND COP (CONTD)
But the longer you bullshit me the
more Im gonna think theres something
else going on

The approaching headlights are joined by swirling red and
blue lights A BACKUP OFFICER arriving

RICKY
Its in the glove box

The backup car comes to a stop in the foggy distance As
the second cop searches the glove box-

COP
Rook got out here quick

SECOND COP
Youthful enthusiasm let him pay for
it he can drive the kid in

The second cop finds Rickys license emerges from the car-

SECOND COP (CONTD)
Get the cuffs on this guy

COP
You just said the rookiell-

SECOND COP
Get the damn cuffs on him

Before he can-
The backup cop approaching on foot his face concealed by
the night SNAPS his flashlight on Shines it right in the

cops eyes

COP
Shit rook knock it off

Rickys cell phone VIBRATES The second cop flips it open
reads the incoming text message ALREADY THERE

And the flashlight shuts off
THWACK -- something comes firing out of the black
The cop moves his leg into a headlights beam
COP (CONTD)
(stunned)

Rook shot me

Ricky slips out of the cops grasp and flees-
The flashlight comes back on darts around the night moves
over the cops assesses who is where-

Before it shuts off again The cop scrambles to get to the
other side of his car but the backup officer FIRES a series
of bullets into the night-

POP-POP-POP-

And the cops body DROPS into darkness and death with an
unceremonious THUMP

The second cop takes cover and SHOOTS He cant see a thing
Pitch black Its guesswork until-

The flashlight comes on again

Locked on a target the second cop fires repeatedly

Until he realizes that the flashlight is wedged between rocks
The shooter is behind him

He turns but the backup officer FIRES a bullet into the second
cops chest Extinguishes the flashlight with another

And then frantic SCURRYING two pairs of footsteps Ricky
racing back to his car and the shooter to his-

Doors SLAM engines REV and theres a WHOOP WHOOP from a
siren on the shooters car the sound of the police as the
two vehicles motor into the night

Davies eyes land hard on Elliot

ELLIOT (CONTD)

at the other reporters gawking at him

ELLIOT (CONTD)
But in fairness to me and thats a
big concern personally every word I
wrote about your boss is true

GARY
I dont care who my boss fucks

Gary drives away from the county building-

ELLIOT
I dont care either but I care that

paper over to the vomiting man

ELLIOT

at a display honoring the fallen officer Coover A detail
catches Elliots eye Coovers service was held at
Morningside Church

Elliot rounds the corner reattaching his pen to his shirt
and suddenly theres a RUSH of blue motion as a cop SHOVES
Elliot into the brick wall

ELLIOT
I figured youd be pissed

THOM
I am youre an idiot

THOM -- a cop clean-cut early twenties Elliots cousin --
bats the pen off of Elliots shirt

ELLIOT
Youre not doing the job right if

Or maybe you end up in jail ‘cause

that ever occur to you

ELLIOT
(retrieves his pen)
Nope

INT THOMS CAR -- DAY
Elliot in the passenger seat fidgets with the radio dial

ELLIOT
Hey did you know Franklin Coover

Thom leans over searches the presets As Elliot speaks
Thom turns the volume up gradually

ELLIOT (CONTD)
The cop who arrested me said Coover
died in the line Officially its a
suicide but his service was at
Morningside and they quite famously
dont accommodate suicides as you
might recall with Uncle Conrad

Elliot shuts the radio off

THOM
Im not talking to you about anything
work-related Im driving you to
your car and thats it Lesson slowly
learned

ELLIOT
Its obvious my quotes were from
higher-ups no one thinks youre the
source for that story

THOM
You managed to get a dig in there

Thom stops at a light

THOM (CONTD)
Ive been doing this four months
bottom of the totem pole here trying
to climb trying to make people proud
of me for once-

ELLIOT

THOM
And how do you show it You get me
drunk on piss rum and get me to tell
you that Im driving the chiefs
mistress around Next thing I know
its in the paper

Theres a honk from behind - its green Thom gives the
driver an apologetic wave accelerates

THOM (CONTD)
One guy slips up and says something
and you immediately think conspiracy
Cops think like that okay if youre
a cop its the job that kills you
its not like hes just some random
guy who shot himself

ELLIOT
So he shot himself

Thom flicks the radio back on

INT ELLIOTS APARTMENT -- DAY

Elliot types Franklin Coover into Google An article about
a police case Coover worked a wedding website a brief

She lights her cigarette and Elliot refuses one
ELLIOT
I keep my vices in rotation - if Im
drinking I dont smoke vice versa
She sits on the trunk of her car
MELISSA

So that means youre drunk right
now

ELLIOT
I meant in more general terms

She searches his eyes Abandons her flirtatious tone

MELISSA
You dont know why he did it You
came to ask me if I do

ELLIOT
I was going to take a while to get
there but yeah

MELISSA
It wasnt about me

ELLIOT
How do you know that

MELISSA
They told me it wasnt just to make
me feel good the CAST guys said it
was something about a case something
about drugs I thought youd know
the rest of it

ELLIOT

The acronym slipped my mind

MELISSA

want you to say anything about me

Elliot waits in his car slumped down out of view the
headlights off The police car pulls on to the street
Elliot gives it a second then goes in pursuit
LATER

Elliot follows as the cop car drives past the exit for the
police station

LATER
And rolls past the city limits heading away from the hills
Elliot remains a few car lengths behind He looks around --

its flat farmland a few dark houses-

ELLIOT
Where are you taking him

No people no cars until-

Elliot catches headlights-

IN THE REAR VIEW

The headlights approach fast insanely fast-

He maneuvers his car to the right as-

The second car ZIPS by-

CUTS sharply in front of Elliots car-

Elliot applies the brakes-

As the second car slows too Elliot sees the two men in the
back seat One looks back -- its Ricky Ricky taps the

shoulder of the other man This is-

AM

Shaved bald no facial hair at all eyebrows gone not a
whisker on the chin Black twenties but weathered An
enraged blankness about him furious and empty eyes

AM fixes his eyes on Elliot And raises a machine gun
into view

ELLIOT

Hits the brakes hard

EXT STREET -- NIGHT

Elliots car falls back

AM lowers his gun Turns back And in precise and
ritualistic gestures places a policemans cap on his head
The car transporting him accelerates

Elliot pulls his car to the side of the road

He checks the rear view there are no other cars

And then-

The muted RAT-A-TAT-TAT of a machine gun

DOWN THE ROAD

The second car pulls alongside the cop car-

The FLASH and ECHOING CRACKLE of gunfire-

Bullets spray the police cruisers exterior-

Elliot gets out of his car crouches down behind his open
door and watches as-

The cars SLOW and SPEED up weaving and jockeying for position
on the road-

A couple of measured aimed SHOTS from the police car-

A flurry of BULLETS from the second car-

And then it swerves around the cruiser and speeds off

The police car pulls to the side of the road

INT ELLIOTS CAR -- NIGHT

A few heart-pounding seconds as Elliot drives up to the police
car No ones seriously hurt Janice the driver was nicked

in the arm by a bullet Lees gun is pointed at Elliot

ELLIOT
Are you guys all right

Marvin sees Elliot sits up

MARVIN
Hey man Hey You gotta-

Janice steps down on the gas and the police car zooms off

Elliot waits surveys the area Rickys car is long gone
He watches the cop car go

ELLIOT
Shit
And pursues it
EXT NORTHRIDGE POLICE STATION -- NIGHT

A smaller station older a squat brick building with four
or five police cars parked in front One has a shattered
window Elliot pulls into the lot

INT NORTHRIDGE POLICE STATION -- NIGHT

Elliot enters Theres no one around He steps behind the
front desk and peers through a window into the station At
the far end of the hall he can see fragments of reflected
movement -- Marvins elbow a blue sleeve

Elliot loses sight of Marvin gets a different angle and
now he sees-

INTO A CONFERENCE ROOM

Seated alone handcuffed to a chair and wearing a prisoners
garb is a young black man with a prominent tattoo on his
neck This is PERCY

The door behind the desk swings open Davies emerges

With a light hand on Elliots shoulder Davies guides him
back to the other side of the desk

DAVIES
Everythings under control

ELLIOT
If everything were under control
youd be at home in bed with your
wife Sorry I didnt mean that

DAVIES
Theres no story here

ELLIOT
I know theres a story I was driving
right behind it
DAVIES
This ends well for you if you drive
home right now

ELLIOT
I saw two of your guys come under
fire I saw the guys who shot at
them I recognize that theres
animosity between us but Im only
doing my job right now Im not
even doing that Someones killing
cops Im here to help you

DAVIES
We dont need it

ELLIOT
I got a good look at them you dont
need this kind of information

Am ambulance pulls up out front - no lights no siren It
occurs to Elliot-

Two paramedics enter gear in hand

ELLIOT (CONTD)
You already know who youre looking
for They shot Coover too didnt
they and you kept a lid on that

sends them into the station

DAVIES
You do have a job to do a function

Davies unlocks the door

I respect it even though its caused

a considerable amount of pain for my

family of late Yours is an important

function but not a necessary one
You cant do your job if we fail at
ours you cant do anything if we
dont keep you safe

Elliot tries to steal another glance at Percy but Davies
obscures his view

DAVIES (CONTD)

You cant write about this It isnt

ready to be written about yet

Davies goes back to his desk Opens a drawer

stuff

tape pens a hammer

ELLIOT
If youre planning on breaking my
writing hand remember Im a lefty

DAVIES
Youre what Six-one six-two

sorts through

Davies finds what he was searching for -- a portable
breathalyzer Tosses it over to Elliot

DAVIES (CONTD)
Six-two call it two hundred and I
can smell the booze on your breath
from here Id say youre blowing a
12 maybe north of that

ELLIOT
Impressive carnival barking But
you cant compel me to do this

DAVIES
You drove yourself to the front door
of a police station and stumbled in
reeking of Jack Daniels I could
have you in cuffs right now

Elliot exhales into the device Returns it to Davies

ELLIOT

it turns ugly quickly The violence is eerily silent the
pummeling and shouting muffled by thick glass

into him keeping his body alive A woman in pink nurses

scrubs stands at the back smoking a cigarette and blowing

the smoke out the window Elliot watches the machines chug
and whir watches the boys chest rise and fall

ELLIOT
They gave you a settlement they
paid you not to talk

He notices Juans tattoos -- clearly gang-related One is
identical to a tattoo on Rickys arm

MARIA

let him go and they gave us money to
take care of him but its gone It
wouldve last twenty years without
the machines But theres no choice
Life is the only choice

streets and Davies is trying to
cover the whole thing up No
response

DONALD
I was imagining the headline
Something Happened

ELLIOT

Rodrigo is bewildered hes not doing anything And then
the officer deploys his taser

Two barbs PIERCE Rodrigos side 50000 volts of electricity
SIZZLE through the wires and enter his body The SHRIEK he
releases is awful blood-curdling and immediate without any
masculine filter a man shrieking like a wounded child

Rodrigo HITS the ground twitches violently The car door
opens as Bethany races to her boyfriends aid-

BETHANY
What are you doing to him

The other cop draws his taser Points it at Bethany

OTHER COP

who tases him again

RODRIGO

LEE (CONTD)
I dont want it to look like it wasnt
a fair fight

Lee takes out his baton

LEE (CONTD)
Get out of the car

ELLIOT

The cop drags Elliot out of the car tosses him down into
the street His head hits with a THUD

LEE

LEE

Suddenly Lee SWINGS his baton and SMASHES it down on Elliots
leg Elliot yells out in pain

radio CHIRPS and he hesitates listens

Its a radioed call for backup In the background of the
call Rodrigos moans and Bethanys screams are audible

EXT DOWNTOWN -- NIGHT
Thom gets out of his police car

Cautiously his gun drawn he enters the alley and approaches
the parked police car

Peers in the front and back -- no one

Gets around the car and continues down the alley to an

He rounds the corner cautiously and sees that-

TWO COPS have someone on the ground handcuffed Theyre in

A gun in his hand
Thom has no time to react

The cop FIRES a bullet into Thom

Bethany DIGS her fingernails into Pauls neck-

Paul SHOVES her away The other cop restrains her

BETHANY
You cant kill him You cant just

PAUL

A passing motorist slows Paul points his taser at the unseen
driver

PAUL
Police business

The car drives on Paul goes over to Bethany

As the other cop holds her Paul presses the taser against
Bethanys throat Slowly he SLIDES it down her body over
her breasts down to her pregnant belly

Rodrigo flails one arm desperately trying to trip up the
cop to prevent this but he cant reach-

BETHANY
Please dont please

Pauls finger TIGHTENS on the trigger

PAUL
Fuck you Both of you

Theres a BANG and-

A BULLET

Explodes the cops head
Bethany screams

As the other cop instinctually FIRES the weapon in his hand
But its a taser not a gun

The darts ZIP through the air its too great a distance
and they fall harmlessly at the feet of

AM

Wearing a loose-fitting policemans uniform and cap betraying
no expression his arm rigid his aim flawless he SHOOTS a
bullet into the second cops chest

The second cop fumbles his gun away But hes not dead

He leans his back against his car tries to push himself to
a standing position but he cant Tries to stop the blood
from cascading out of his wound He cant

AM picks up the cops gun

Gun in each hand he leans against the police cruiser and
SLIDES down into a sitting position a few feet away from the
cop AMs eyes study the asphalt

AM
Is it painful

The blood flows turns the cops uniform a darker blue

AM (CONTD)
Its been a long time

With a wave of his gun AM indicates the dead Paul The
cop looks over and when his head turns AM fires a bullet
at the street

The bullet ricochets up and PINGS harmlessly off of the
side of the car

Do you remember me

The cop tries to ease away but cant go far inches AM
adjusts his aim and fires a second bullet at the street It
takes a short hop and careens away

OTHER COP

AM lowers his eyes to the ground Finds a new angle with

He dies
AM sets the guns down on the road

Protecting them from him
Lee picks himself up Elliot tries to buy the cop some time
ELLIOT
This is to get revenge for what
happened at Central Because its
not going to make anything better
not in the jails on the streets
Killing cops is only going to mean
more cops

AM
Ill buy more bullets

AM catches Elliot stealing another look and pivots at the
same instant that he FIRES-

Where Lee used to be but hes gone The bullet pings off
of a guard rail

ON THE TELEVISIONS

Each offers the same violent series of images A montage of
real footage captured on video cameras and cell phones
documenting actual cases of police brutality

A cop applies a taser to a handcuffed non-resisting female
protester She screams out in pain

A cop repeatedly punches a handcuffed man in the face
Cops brutalize a sixty-year-old man

A dozen cops swarm a car drag three young men out onto the
street beat them punch them kick them

Frederick Williams a church deacon is restrained surrounded
by cops He pleads for his life Instead he is tased until
he ceases moving ceases breathing dies

And finally on a crowded street in Puerto Rico a cop
wrestles with a man The cop pulls his gun and fires several
bullets The man squirms in near-death agony The cop fires
a kill shot into the mans head

AM
We were born into this conflict our
parents grandparents it was the same
Nothing has changed Theyve been
putting fear into us for too long

the city

AM

If we have to before they kill us
Theyre moving down the list

ELLIOT
The list they have the gangster

AM
They dont have to kill all of us to
achieve what they want Kill the
names at the top cut off the head
of the snake and send the rest a
message Its not your city

ELLIOT
Its not hard to persuade me of a
conspiracy I know the departments
crooked under Davies I know things

its El Salvador in the 1980s

INT NORTHRIDGE STORAGE ROOM -- DAY
ON A TELEVISION
From the dashcam feed Paul tases Rodrigo again and again

DAVIES
Unacceptable

Davies stands beside the tv

He addresses twenty cops the remaining members of the CAST
unit Lee sits in the corner silent fidgeting with the
bandage covering the nasty wound on his ear (Notably absent
is Gary - hes not part of the unit)

DAVIES (CONTD)
Theres no excuse for this For
extending the situation We had him
idd there was no one else on the
road By now he should be dead

On the tape AM emerges from the night his gun firing-

DAVIES (CONTD)
If the suspect had been properly
handled none of this would have
happened But now it has Theyve
pushed us to the point where we cant
continue to simply cut at the margins
of the problem We need to confront
the threat directly

Davies goes over to the SWAT uniforms He lowers a
bulletproof vest and dons it

DAVIES (CONTD)
The media will expand coverage of
the shootings expose this new threat
the gangs united People will be
afraid

Davies removes his gun Hands it to Lee Davies counts his
steps silently as he strides to the other end of the room

DAVIES (CONTD)
Well be able to hit them hard now
and in the open

Davis stops turns back to face Lee

DAVIES (CONTD)
Put a bullet in my heart

LEE
What

DAVIES
I want you to shoot me shoot me in
the heart Shoot me in the heart

Lee drops to one knee Takes careful aim And SHOOTS

The bullet SMASHES into the center of the vest knocking
Davies back half a step at best Steadies himself

Things are so fucked up maybe Im
irrelevant my way of thinking I

things without thinking of the
consequences dumb instinct its

Panthers footage a civil uprising in Central America
Tiananmens Square people fighting back against the police

The last few gangsters file in now fully disguised as cops
Theres no standard issue firearm each gangster cop has
his own piece The mood is somber the moments before battle

AM
There are many neighborhoods in this
city this state this country where
the people are afraid of the police
Where they are more scared of the
police than they are of the gangsters
The police dont exist to protect
and serve the people any longer
They protect the rich and serve the
corporations They are enemies of
the people We pay the police we
pay them to exist And they repay
us by using the batons tasers and
bullets we bought against us They
kill us in the streets like wild
dogs They lock us in cages One
in one hundred locked up In the
jails and the streets weve given
them enough bodies Weve allowed
them to treat us like dogs too long
Our day has come Let them throw us
scraps let them reach down to pat
us on the head Because today we
will rise up We will snap our mighty
jaws and we will bite their throats

The CAST troops storm out of the buses like an occupying
military force

FROM THE STREET ABOVE

As the CAST cops prepare Davies and Lee (the only two CAST
cops in blue uniforms) survey the growing crowd below

DAVIES

shooters weve been looking for

Before Davies can reply the two cops are joined by ten

GARY

Sandra pauses just before she unlocks Marvins cell Turns
to Gary a hand lowering to her gun

SANDRA
Explain to me what this is again

EXT HILL -- DAY

A chartered bus arrives delivering more protesters They
make their way through AM and the other gangster cops
moving down the hill and towards the park A lot of curious
looks And then suddenly-

A commotion-

A handful of CAST officers have left the park to advance on
AM and his men-

AM draws his gun-
Other gangster cops do the same-
The cops duck behind their riot shields-

And they LAUNCH tear gas canisters the explosions muffled
by the cheering in the park below

The canisters ARC through the air and land EXPLODING at the
feet of the gangster cops and late-arriving protesters

Flashes of light noxious smoke fills the area-
And the line starts to break apart-

AM
Hold your ground

But theres a sense of panic in the area with the protesters
terrified unsure of what theyre caught up in-

A few tentative shots are exchanged but no one can see well
enough to aim through the haze-

And then-

The CAST cops their ears protected deploy the sonic crowd
control device the sound weapon

Theres a loud crackle and then the device emits an EAR-
PIERCING tone-

It provokes immediate screams of pain people drop to their
knees-

AM clutches his head the sound overwhelms him and he
runs to escape it-

EXT DOWNTOWN PARK -- DAY

Maggy hears something from above She still has her camera
Hiding behind her friends she points it up-

THROUGH MAGGYS LENS
AM charges down the hill

His troops follow

From this vantage point theres no sign of the CAST cops
the tear gas is just a vague haze theres no sense of what
precipitated this-

So it looks like the gangster cops guns drawn are storming
the park

OTHERS
In the crowd take notice
The panic spreads rapidly-
INT NORTHRIDGE HOLDING AREA -- DAY
Marvin remains in his cell Sandra is growing doubtful
ELLIOT
Nothings confused Everythings

Gary hesitates clearly confused

Elliot notices Sandra unholster her gun Theres no time to

Elliot LUNGES forward and PINS her arms to her body-

Ricky tries to snatch the gun but hes cuffed After a
brief struggle Elliot gets the gun away from Sandra

The cop smashes his shield into her knocks her to the ground
And then his head JERKS backwards

He falls a bullet in his neck

AM appears

He is relentless unleashing a storm of bullets that BOUNCE
off of the second cops shield and drive him backwards until
hes stumbling his shield dipping up and down-

Now AM waits for a good clean shot but-

The cop gets one first

Bang

AM looks down see that his right leg has been exploded
open Blood everywhere He screams a controlled clipped
scream Fires back Hes out of bullets

The cop takes aim for a second shot but the older woman
grabs his arm He cant shake her off and AM manages to
limp away back into the park moving against the tide he
gets quickly lost in the crush of people fleeing-

dropping the bullets

AMs trembling hand closes around a bullet

INT SAFE HOUSE -- DAY

Elliot plays the dvd on the large screen The tv begins
with nothing blackness then a hum and static and-

Images cut in and out of the static with significant time
jumps The audio is muddy the picture quality poor

The video camera is in the hands of a prison guard Hes
filming a prisoner on his back as hes led down a hall by
two other guards Coover and Lee

The officers stop at the Medical Unit-

The camera CUTS OUT and back-

As the prisoner has been strapped to a gurney held motionless
by thick black straps Catch a quick glimpse of the
prisoners bruised face Its AM

CUT OUT resume as-

A NEEDLE punctures AMs skin injecting him with morphine
The needle is in the hands of Dr Weems

A group of men observe the procedure The two guards a man
in a suit and Davies

CUT OUT and back as-

AM is unconscious Dr Weems removes a medical instrument
from a drawer It looks like an icepick

Weems goes over to AM He makes a small adjustment tilting
AMs head back

Weems instructs Coover to help Following the doctors lead-
Coover lifts AMs eyelid

Holds it open

Weems SLIDES the icepick into AMs tear duct

He TAPS the pick with a small hammer lightly

Once twice three times until theres a crack

Two more taps yield a fuller CRACK

The orbital bone breaks

Weems sets the hammer aside

He moves around to a position behind AMs head Takes the
ice pick and PUSHES it forward

A couple of inches into AMs brain

Weems JOSTLES the icepick back and forth

AM stirs slightly Weems steadies AMs head with one
hand while he jabs with the other severing the connections
to the frontal lobe SCRAPING away brain matter-

And-

ELLIOT

Cant watch any more He pauses it

Sees someone reflected in the tv standing behind him

Its the girl with the short red hair

She looks distraught horrified tears in her eyes Clearly
she was watching too

RED-HAIRED WOMAN
What were they doing What were
they doing to him

Elliot is visibly shaken by what he saw-
ELLIOT
They didnt beat them they

lobotomized them

RED-HATRED WOMAN
Whats that mean

Hes distracted by a lingering sense that shes familiar-

ELLIOT
They cut out part of the brain they
did them in mental hospitals fifty
years ago it was supposed to make
patients less violent pacify them
mostly it killed them

(scrutinizes her face)

How do I know you

RED-HAIRED WOMAN
Why would they do that Why did
they do that

She turns from Elliot looks out the open door

RED-HAIRED WOMAN (CONTD)
Why would you do that

Shes asking someone else And it dawns on Elliot - both
whos outside and who she is

ELLIOT
You dyed your hair Youre Mandy
Lynx Mandy Lynx from the Motel Six
But youre not his mistress youre
his mole
Davies enters He sees the image frozen on the tv

DAVIES
She was both actually

Davies fires a bullet into Mandys chest She hits the
ground He puts another bullet into her head

A window SHATTERS downstairs
Davies turns the gun on Elliot

DAVIES (CONTD)
Sit down

Elliot sits Footsteps on the stairs as Lee still wearing
his policemans blues ascends from the basement

LEE
Theres nobody down there

He sees Mandys body

LEE (CONTD)
Nobody anywhere

DAVIES
Check the grounds again

Lee exits Davies hits play on the dvd and it continues
jumping ahead to preparations for another procedure

DAVIES (CONTD)
It wasnt solely a deterrent to
show the others what we were capable
of They are mentally ill theyre
sick I thought I could help make
them functional

ELLIOT
You stuck icepicks into their eyes

DAVIES
Its science an accepted technique
tens of thousands were performed in
this country

ELLIOT
Fifty years ago the Dark Ages

On the tv the procedure goes awry When his skull is
cracked the inmate jolts awake

DAVIES
It was an attempt to solve a problem
The violence is born into them I
thought we could scrape some of it
out

The inmate fights the straps pinning him down the guards
step in to restrain him Weems readies another injection

DAVIES (CONTD)
The failure justifies our new method

The inmate ceases moving

DAVIES (CONTD)
Its a disease it spreads spreads
to our kids Their culture of
violence Its my duty to arrest
its progress

ELLIOT
Youre talking about people about
killing human beings

DAVIES
Its not the same theyre not the
same as us dont you see that
They kill each other over street
corners they dont even own all
they know how to do is kill each
other All were doing is
accelerating the natural order

Someone enters -- Davies glances up briefly sees the familiar
shade of blue and theres a habitual easing of the nerves

DAVIES (CONTD)
Anything

No response Davies looks again

Its not Lee

Its Ricky

He holds a gun unsteadily his arms wobbling

Davies lifts his gun and-

Ricky FIRES once

The bullet CLIPS Davies in the shoulder

He staggers back Doesnt fall Regains his balance
And SHOOTS a bullet into Elliot

Ricky immediately shoots back at Davies but he misses misses
again-

Davies takes cover behind the couch-
Ricky ducks behind the doorway
He looks over at Elliot whos fallen to the floor

A stunned look on Elliots face blood seeps from a wound in
his stomach

Bang Bang Bang
Three bullets ZIP by Rickys head and embed in the wall

Ricky doesnt even have time to aim he fires in the direction
of where the shots came from and-

Davies takes another bullet in the opposite shoulder This
time he groans loudly drops his gun falls to his knees

Ricky rushes over sticks his foot out and-

KICKS Davies down to the ground

PRESSES the trembling gun against the back of Davies head
Looks back at Elliot

He cant see his face but Elliot is still moving-

RICKY
What do I do

And then frantic footsteps someone CHARGES in-

DAVIES
Stay out

But its too late Lee doesnt hear the warning

Ricky SHOOTS

The first bullet hits Lee in the gut the second in the chest
Lee falls dead

Ricky freaks out

RICKY
Fuck man fuck What do I do

Ricky sees Davies try to get up and he kicks him back down

RIPS the handcuffs off of Davies belt WRENCHES the sheriffs
arms behind his back SNAPS the handcuffs on

DAVIES
Youre arresting me

Ricky scoops up Davies gun a gun in each hand now
In the distance faint SIRENS

Ricky steps away from Davies goes over to Elliot kneels
down to see his face-

RICKY
What do I do

But Elliots eyes are blank

Hes gone

The sirens draw closer

Ricky retreats to the doorway

Davies handcuffed and bleeding rolls himself over on to
his back He tilts his neck looks back scans the carnage

An upside-down view of Elliots body

DAVIES
Dont worry

When Davies eyes reach the doorway its empty

Ricky fled
Davies
Closer

And he

CUT TO

listens to the sirens
and closer
smiles

DAVIES (CONTD)
Somebody called the cops

BLACK
