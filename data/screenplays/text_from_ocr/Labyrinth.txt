LABYRINTH

by

Terry Jones
FADE IN ON

EXT SKY — DAY

A WHITE BIRD soaring The sky is a glorious explosion of blue and
mauve and lavender The setting sun washes the clouds with a
delicate pink tint The bird swoops and spirals and we are right
there with him Then suddenly below us an extraordinary sight
appears

EXT LABYRINTH — DAY

It is the labyrinth an enormous maze of incredible mandala like
intricacy From our magnificent vantage point WE ARE BARELY ABLE TO
MAKE OUT its details the twisting walls interrupted here and there
by lush forest the complex web of waterways the forbidding castle
at the core It is vast and magical frightening and compelling at
the same time We would love to linger perhaps fly lower and get a
better look at this wondrous place but the bird flies on

EXT GLADE — DAY

It is an idyllic setting warm and inviting The late afternoon sun
washes everything with a pink glow Between the water and a line of
lush fruit trees is a flower-strewn glade A FIGURE emerges from the
trees and walks toward the water It is a YOUNG WOMAN dressed in a
flowing white dress that swirls around her in the breeze The pink
light burnishes her hair and causes a gold circlet she wears on her
head to glow She is breathtaking a vision of innocence and grace
She stops to pick a flower and then turns suddenly as if she has
heard something

GIRL
Is it you

She takes a few hurried steps and then stops smiling shyly

GIRL
Your Highness

The Girl curtsies deeply and then looks up through lowered lashes
the shy smile still dancing on her lips And then WE PULL BACK TO
REVEAL a crown perched on a head of tight curls WE ARE LOOKING
THROUGH the crown at the girl as she rises slowly then looks boldly
at the PRINCE

GIRL
Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight
of you my lord For though my father the
Duke has promised you my hand I cannot
consent to be yours until the evil that
stalks our land from highest hill to deepest
dale is

Suddenly the Girl stops speaking a look of stunned confusion on her
face
GIRL
from highest hill to deepest dale
(her brow furrows in
concentration and then)
Damn

She burrows one hand into the deep sleeve of her gown and pulls out
a
rolled-up soft-cover book She rifles through the pages

The Prince is not a Prince at all but a SHEEPDOG wearing a tin foil
crown He thinks his work is over and its time to play and he
lunges happily towards the Girl who isnt a Prince ss or even a
duchess but 15-year-old SARAH

Sarah is knocked over by the playful Dog Beneath the gown which WE
CAN NOW SEE is homemade and not very grand at all WE SEE faded
jeans and running shoes

SARAH
Get off me you monster

The Dog grabs the book out of her hand and runs away with it hoping
to be chased Sarah doesnt follow she just sits up and pulls the
grass out of her tangled hair and sighs with frustration The Dog
comes back over to Sarah its tail wagging hopefully

SARAH
If you value your mangy life Merlin youll
hand it over

The Dog obediently drops the book

THE BOOK

On the cover it says MEANDERS QUEEN a play in three acts by
Robin Zakar Sarah reaches for it and we hear a clock tower begin to
chime

Sarah leaps to her feet

SARAH
Oh no Merlin Were really late Why does
everything have to happen to me

MERLIN prances around her happily his foil crown in his mouth

Sarah pulls it out of his mouth and throws it in a nearby trash

basket He rushes after it and peers into the basket wanting to
fetch

SARAH
Its all your fault you miserable mutt

She hikes up her dress and runs into the trees Merlin whimpers and
tags along behind her
EXT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TREES — DAY

Sarah comes bursting through the trees and runs down a hill toward
the street WE PULL BACK and WE CAN SEE an enormous steel mill on
the other side of the river And now WE NOTICE that the light isnt
pink any more but sort of dull and hazy and the idyllic glade is
barely a suburban park and this is just an ordinary day in a very
ordinary place

EXT AN OLD RAMBLING HOUSE — DUSK

Sarah runs up a path to an older rambling house She goes through
the front door Merlin hot on her heels and neither one of them
sees the beautiful snow-white bird that lands in a tree beside the
path

INT INSIDE THE ROUSE — EVENING

Sarah bursts through the front door and makes a beeline for the
stairs She almost makes it SARAHS MOTHER appears in the hallway

MOTHER
Sarah where have you been

Sarah abruptly stops and changes to an elegantly graceful ascension
of the stairs

SARAH
(in an affected voice)
I cant talk to you now Im in rehearsal

She continues grandly on and heads for her room

MOTHER
You were supposed to be home an hour ago to
baby-sit for Freddie Dont we at least
deserve an explanation

Sarah stops and leans over the railing She speaks with a
melodramatic solemnity

SARAH
As Meanders Queen Ive been meandering
Dither me not about explanations

With that she turns and heads for her room On the door is a sign
that says Admittance by Invitation Only SARAHS FATHER comes
into the hall

FATHER
Whats that all about

MOTHER
Its a part in a play
(raising her voice)
- but thats no reason to

Sarah turns in her doorway She calls down
SARAH
Chasten not your Queen Peasant

She dramatically sweeps into her room

INT SARAHS ROOM — NIGHT
Sarah slams the door and leans against it playing the scene

FATHER (VO)
Sarah thats no way to talk to your mother

SARAH
(mumbles to herself)
Shes not my mother

Sarah takes a deep breath and closes her eyes She can hear
footsteps and SOMEONE comes to the other side of the door

Sarah ignores her STEPMOTHER and kicks off her running shoes

With a practiced gesture Sarah removes her jeans while leaving her
gown in place

STEPMOTHER (VO)
Sarah when I tell you to be home at five I
expect you to be home at five

Sarah quickly shifts to her Stepmothers attitude — hands on hips
and silently mimes her words

SARAH
Yes Madame

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

STEPMOTHER
And dont Yes Madame me

FATHER
Is she all right

STEPMOTHER
(frustrated)
Of course shes all right I left the
Bernsteins number on the kitchen table
Freddie might be coming down with a cold so
call us if he seems even the least bit
uncomfortable

SARAH (VO)
(sighs)
Yes Mother

STEPMOTHER
Oh I give up

She hurries down the stairs
FATHER
Well see you later baby And remember

INT SARAHS ROOM — NIGHT
Sarah speaks along with him mimicking

SARAH and FATHER (VO)
Dont open the door to strangers

We hear him leave Sarah waits a beat and then turns and opens her
bedroom door

SARAH
And dont call me baby
(she slams the door shut
mimicking her parents)
Precious little Freddie might be coming down
with a cold

She sighs and looks around This is really her world her retreat
and she knows and controls every inch of it The shelves are filled
with an orderly array of childhood dolls and toys The books are
lined up neatly in the bookcase and if we could see them up close we
would see that they were placed in alphabetical order — and
according to the year they were acquired She walks over to her
dresser She checks herself out in the mirror above the chest of
drawers and adjusts the golden circlet which has been knocked askew
by her run She then stops for a moment and looks at the photographs
on the dresser One of her Father her Mother and herself as a
Little Girl Another picture of her Mother in a newspaper clipping
is taped to the mirror The headline says Linda Williams a Smash
in New Play A cover of a Playbill is also tacked on to the mirror
It says Best of Both Worlds starring Linda Williams Sarah then
reverently opens a music box — the kind with a twirling dancer
inside — and to the strains of an unbearably tinny version of
Greensleeves she begins to rehearse

SARAH
Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight
of you my Lord
Suddenly something stops her cold
SARAH
(yelling angrily)
Someone has been in my room
Through the mirror WE SEE what she sees an empty space on one of
the shelves She swirls around and rushes out the door
INT THE HALLWAY — NIGHT

Sarah bursts out of her room

SARAH
Wheres Lancelot
She stomps down the hallway
SARAH
Wheres my bear
INT NURSERY — NIGHT
Sarah enters Freddies room She searches the nursery

SARAH
Nobody listens to a thing I say

She opens a toy box and rifles through it
SARAH
How many times have I told them to stay out

of my room

She gets to the crib and looks down FREDDIE is wide awake gurgling
at Lancelot Sarahs tattered old teddy bear

SARAH
And you you can just give me back my bear

She yanks it out of the crib and leaves Freddie looks hurt and his
face starts to cloud up

INT SARAHS ROOM — NIGHT

Sarah is curled up on her bed cuddling her bear Merlin sits beside
her She looks at the dog

SARAH
Youre the only one who understands me

Merlin

He licks her face She gets up and holds the bear out in front of
her

SARAH
Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight
of you my lord

She is interrupted by Freddies cries

SARAH
Go to sleep Freddie

The cries get louder Sarah sighs and repeats her favorite litany

SARAH
Why does everything have to happen to me
INT NURSERY — NIGHT
Sarah enters and approaches the howling infant

SARAH
I dont need this

She pulls the blanket up over him and attempts to tuck him in

SARAH
There isnt that nice

But Freddie doesnt think so He pushes the blanket off and howls
even louder Sarah sees one of his toys on the floor and picks it up
and gives it to him She speaks through gritted teeth

SARAH
Want your nice toy

But Freddie doesnt He flings the toy across the room Sarah bends
over the crib and speaks softly

SARAH
You know Freddie I heard that the only
thing to do with a baby who wont stop crying
is to get some goblins to come over and teach
him a lesson

Freddie lowers his screams to a whimper but a loud whimper

SARAH
How would you like that kid A nasty evil
goblin

Freddie is quiet for a moment almost as if he is considering Then
he really howls Sarah sighs and picks him up She begins to pace
back and forth and starts to hum Freddie goes back to a mere
whimper

SARAH
Oh you like that do you

She begins to hum even louder and more melodically as she places the
baby back into the crib She then begins one of the moat macabre
lullabies you could ever imagine She sings of how scary the dark
is how the shadows on the wall like to eat you when youre small
and how a baby doesnt stand a chance when the Goblins start their
dance She throws herself into her performance adding to it a wild
dance that has her whirling around the room leaping into the air
making strange shadows on the wall Finally the dance ends when too
many crazed pirouettes result in her stumbling against Freddies
dresser She staggers a bit and then the lights blink as a crack of
thunder is heard followed by a flash of lightning

ANOTHER ANGLE

Little Freddie is wailing He hasnt understood a thing that Sarah
has sung but he can sense that something is wrong
SARAH
Ah cmon Freddie It was just a song

They are interrupted by the sound of the doorbell Sarah reacts with
a gasp of surprise Freddie for some inexplicable reason is
suddenly quiet

INT FOYER — NIGHT

Sarah approaches the front door with some trepidation She starts to
open it then realizes what she is doing She fastens the chain and
only then opens the door

EXT HOUSE — NIGHT
SARAHS POV

Through the door opening Sarah can see a very elegantly dressed
quite good-looking MAN of an indeterminate age He has a worldly
air or is it other-worldly Before he can speak a flash of
lightning illuminates his face He is a mesmerizing sight and Sarah
cant help but gawk

MAN
Excuse me is this the home of Sarah
Williams Sarah Williams the actress
Sarahs jaw drops
SARAH
Thats me
MAN

Allow me to introduce myself
(he holds out his hand)
Im Robin Zaker

Sarah squeals with delight

SARAH
You wrote the play

He smiles
SARAH
Just a second
INT FOYER — NIGHT
Sarahs hand hesitates over the chain for just a moment and then
she unfastens it and opens the door Zakar enters and extends his
hand
ZAKAR

It is an honour Miss Williams I understand
you make a delightful Queen Meander
SARAH
Well weve just started rehearsal but how
did you know

ZAKAR
I was passing through this part of the
country and heard that it was going to be
done here This is the first amateur
production of the play which of course is
delightful for me

SARAH
You know we were supposed to open tonight
but we got delayed The firemen had to use
the hall

ZAKAR
Yes I know thats why I wanted to stop by
to see you

They are interrupted by a particularly loud crash from upstairs And
then Freddie begins to howl

SARAH
Thats my brother

There is another crash and Sarah starts up the stairs

SARAH
Ill be right back

Zakar watches her run up the stairs He glances around and then
walks right to the liquor cabinet and takes out a bottle

INT NURSERY — NIGHT

Freddie in standing in his crib crying his eyes out Sarah rushes in
and sees that the storm has blown open the basement window and it is
crashing against the wall She rushes to close it Freddies screams
are piteous

SARAH
Oh Freddie

There is more thunder and then lightning flashes across the
darkened room

ZAKAR (VO)
Perhaps I can soothe him

Sarah gasps and whirls around Zakar is framed in the doorway He
has a drink in his hand Sarah holds the baby close

SARAH
You shouldnt be up here

ZAKAR
(smoothly )
I just wanted to help
Sarah rushes by him still clutching the baby

INT HALLWAY — NIGHT

Sarah comes out of the nursery and hurries down the stairs Zakar
follows Freddie is still crying

SARAH
Maybe youd better leave

She gets to the bottom of the stairs Freddie whimpers Zakar is
making her very nervous

SARAH
- I uh dont think I care to talk to you
about the play

He is right behind her almost too close

ZAKAR
Neither do I

Sarah is shocked and disturbed by this

SARAH
What

Zakar reaches over and smoothes Freddies hair

ZAKAR
Im more concerned about the baby of course

Sarah pulls Freddie out of his reach

SARAH
Freddies just fine

But he isnt Hes still crying Zakar reaches into his pocket and
pulls out a coin Be runs it over his fingers right in front of
Freddies face The baby stops crying

ZAKAR
There isnt that better

SARAH
(nervously)
Uh sure but you really have to leave

Zakar ignores her and heads into the living room

ZAKAR
Im not just a playwright as you can see
bring him in here and Ill do some other
tricks for him

SARAH
No Youve got to
But he is already in the living room She follows still holding the
baby

INT LIVING ROOM — NIGHT

Zakar is sitting on the sofa looking very comfortable Sarah stands
in the doorway not sure what to do Reluctantly she goes and sits
down across from him

ZAKAR
Now watch this Freddie

He reaches into his breast pocket and tugs on the handkerchief
there It comes out followed by many others all different colours
Sarah rolls her eyes This is not that exciting a trick Freddie
isnt impressed either In fact he starts to cry again

ZAKAR
So youre going to be like that are you
Freddie Well you know what that means

He leans across the table and Sarah pulls the baby closer

ZAKAR
Its time to call the goblins

SARAH
What

Sarah is surprised to hear this to say the least It echoes her
silly threat to Freddie earlier

ZAKAR
Yes Thats what we do with bad babies we
send for the goblins

And with that he reaches into yet another pocket and pulls out a
poorly made very silly-looking goblin hand puppet Sarah laughs
with relief Zakar his hand in the puppet talks in a high-pitched
unconvincing goblin voice

ZAKAR
You like goblins dontcha Freddie
(singsong)
But I bet your sister doesnt

Sarah rolls her eyes at this and then gasps Because for one very
strange moment the puppet keeps bouncing but both of Zakars hands
are visible And then the puppet seems to move away from the table
and disappear Freddie claps his hands with delight Sarah jumps out
of her chair

SARAH
Where is it

Zakar points to a large cabinet against the wall

ZAKAR
Its in there
SARAH
Impossible

ZAKAR
See for yourself

Sarah hesitates for a moment and then places Freddie carefully on
the rug She then marches over to the cabinet and throws open the
door

ANOTHER ANGLE

The puppet grinning wildly from inside the cabinet

ANOTHER ANGLE

Sarah gasps and involuntarily slams the door She whirls around to
face Zakar

SARAH
How did you do that

Zakar leans back into the sofa

ZAKAR
Magic

SARAH
Oh sure

She nods skeptically She cant see — but WE CAN DEFINITELY SEE —
the cabinet door slowly open behind her and out of it comes a tiny
fierce-looking GOBLIN This is not a puppet but a living creature
that moves quickly out of sight with an exaggerated tiptoe Sarah is
busy with another problem She doesnt see Freddie

SARAH
Wheres Freddie

Zakar shrugs In a panic Sarah begins to look around this room She
calls for Freddie and as she passes in front of the living room
doorway WE CAN SEE something scurry across the hallway Sarah stops
and listens

SARAH
Freddie

But it wasnt a baby she heard Behind her there is more scurrying
as CREATURES begin to appear from various parts of the room We hear
faint snickering She turns to Zakar terrified

SARAH
Where is he

Zakar points to the chair Sarah was sitting in She is behind the
chair and cant see anything But when she comes around in front of
it she sees Freddie comfortably ensconced in the cushions And hes
playing with the goblin puppet Sarah reaches over and grabs the
puppet out of his hands She flings it across the room and scoops up
the baby

SARAH
Who are you

Zakar throws back his head and laughs then suddenly leaps off the
sofa and lands very close to her

ZAKAR
Ive been known by many names but the one
I prefer is Jareth King of the Goblins

Sarah holds Freddie close and backs away

SARAH
I dont believe this

Amidst thunder and lightning Jareth flings his arms up into the air
and he is suddenly dressed in strange medieval garb a cloak
swirling around him And whats worse much much worse is that
suddenly GOBLINS are everywhere Popping out of drawers from under
chairs swinging off the chandeliers Sarah turns and runs out of
the room

INT FOYER — NIGHT

Its worse in here The Goblins are pouring down the stairs some
slide down the bannister Sarah tries running into another room but
is soon back followed by a DOZEN MORE She barely makes it to the
front door and struggles to open it with the baby in her arms The
Goblins pull her back and laugh wildly They fling her right into
Jareths arms He scoops Freddie up and whirls away from her Sarah
tries to grab the baby back but the Goblins get between them

SARAH
(hysterical)
Give him back you monster Give him back

Jareth only laughs and starts to swirl gracefully Freddie laughs
with delight and Sarah struggles to reach him With a superhuman
effort she pushes through the mass of creatures and grabs onto
Jareths fluttering cloak Its like being caught up in a whirlwind
of incredible force

SARAH
(screaming)
I wont let you take him

But its too late Sarahs feet leave the ground and she is pulled
with them and the whole mass of Goblins Jareth and Freddie swirl up
through where the ceiling would have been up into the blackness
Theres a QUICK MONTAGE OF SHOTS Jareths laughing face Sarah
desperate as her fingers are losing their grip Freddie whos
having a great time Goblins all gleeful then — Jareths garment
pulls out of Sarahs grip She falls OUT OF FRAME a silent scream
on her face
EXT LABYRINTH — DAY
A WIDE PEACEFUL SHOT

The sky is pink and the white bird swoops by us as WE TILT DOWN TO
SEE the exterior wall of the labyrinth It is a high masonry wall
that extends off in either direction Along the wall are various
ornamental bushes and there is a small figure of a dwarf his back
to us peeing into a tiny pond It looks for all the world like one
of those ornamental garden sculptures But it isnt This is HOGGLE
In a CLOSER SHOT which is quite discreet Hoggle finishes peeing
and goes over to a particularly lush shrub A few butterfly-like
creatures flower fairies flit around the bushes

HOGGLE
An hows me pride an joy

He leans forward to sniff one of the magnificent blossoms sighing
with pleasure as he does But before he can indulge he is stopped by
the whistling sound of a falling object Sarah falls from the sky
and lands right on his prize shrub Incensed he screams with fury

HOGGLE
What is this Look what you done You
murderer

Sarah struggles out of the broken shrub

SARAH
What are you saying you horrible little
man

HOGGLE

I aint horrible Im Hoggle And just look
Youve destroyed me prize blossoms

He realizes the extent of the damage to his prize specimen

HOGGLE
Ill get ya for it you big oaf

And he picks up a spray can and goes after Sarah But shes had
enough After the nightmarish kidnapping of Freddie and a drop from
the deepest space this guy is childs play She reaches out and
pulls the can from Hoggles hands She then grabs him by the shirt-
front and practically lifts him off the ground

SARAH
Oh no you dont If anyones getting anything
around here its me now where my
brother

HOGGLE

I aint sayin nothin til ye let me go
Sarah sighs and lets go

SARAH
Im sorry But this just hasnt been my day
Hoggle looks at his crushed shrub again

HOGGLE
Ye aint the only one

Sarah ignores him and stares at the massive wall behind them

SARAH
And I dont understand any of this

Hoggle shakes his head and sighs

HOGGLE
Now where have I heard that before

SARAH
What do you mean

HOGGLE

I mean everyone who comes here thinkin they
can make it through the labyrinth says
sumthin like

(mimicking Sarah ina

whiny high pitch)

I dont understand this whatever am I

doing here how will I ever get home

SARAH
What makes you think Im here to get through
a labyrinth

Hoggle shakes his head again

HOGGLE
Cant think of any reason why youd be
standin here in front o this gate if you
werent

Sarah doesnt understand what he is talking about but when she looks
up she cant believe her eyes

ANOTHER ANGLE

A huge gate where just a moment ago there nothing but smooth
endless wall Sarah gulps in disbelief Then the huge wooden doors
fly open and a terrified CREATURE runs out full speed screaming
for his life Right behind him come TWO MENACING GOBLINS riding on
strange BEASTS They are armed and dangerous looking They quickly
catch up with the creature and drag him screaming piteously back
through the gate Before the gates close Sarah can see MORE GOBLINS
what seems like hundreds of them Some are mounted most of them are
armed And beyond them a walled passageway seems to go on forever
Then the wooden doors slam shut

SARAH
Oh no Not more goblins
HOGGLE

Thats Jareths goblin army and that other
poor fool musta been caught meanderin where

he had no business

SARAH
What will they do to him

HOGGLE

I dont like to think about things like that

Sarah shudders

SARAH
I wonder if things can get any worse

Hoggle sighs knowingly

HOGGLE
Hes taken sumthin o yours aint he

Sarah is clearly surprised

HOGGLE
Jareth our high an mighty king

Sarah nods excited that someone has a grasp of the situation

HOGGLE

Bet hes gone and taken sumthin you love

SARAH
(shrugging)
Close Hes got my baby brother

Hoggle laughs derisively

HOGGLE
Baby snatchin Thats low

SARAH
So Ive just got to do something

HOGGLE
Like what

SARAH
Get Freddie back of course

HOGGLE
Then yad have ta make it through the

labyrinth ‘cause Jareths castle is at its

very center
Sarah looks at the gates and gulps

SARAH
Is it difficult

Hoggle snorts with derision
HOGGLE
Is me prize shrub crushed into oblivion

Sarah is reaching the breaking point

SARAH
Look Im sorry about your bush But its not
like I asked to have some weirdo come and
take my baby brother and then drop me out of
the sky

HOGGLE
Well I didnt ask for some overgrown flower
fairy to drop on me prized possession
neither

SARAH
Oh this is ridiculous

And she stalks off to the gate mumbling all the way

SARAH
(to herself)
standing here wasting time talking to
some weird guy who should be living under a
bridge

She is almost at the gate when she freezes with fear Through the
gate she can hear the cheers and jeers of the Goblins and what
might be the wailing of their poor captive Theres no way she wants
to risk facing that horrific crew Hoggle has come up behind her and
as she backs away from the gate she bumps into him She shrieks and
whirls around

HOGGLE
That aint the only way in ya know

Sarah is very relieved to hear this

SARAH
Its not

HOGGLE
Course it aint Theres many a route in
just only one way out

SARAH
Well show me one Ive got to find my
brother

Hoggle sighs impatiently Be fingers a belt that he wears rattling
it in an obvious manner It in hung with every kind of watch and
bracelet and ring you can imagine

HOGGLE
Information like that has a price

Sarah taken aback by the amount of loot hes acquired
SARAH
I could give you this

She takes the gold circlet off her head Hoggle isnt interested

HOGGLE

I had sumthin o this caliber in mind

He takes her hand and WE SEE that she is wearing a beautiful ruby
ring Sarah shakes her head vehemently

SARAH
No My mother gave me that

Hoggle eyes it greedily

HOGGLE
She could give ya another

SARAH
No she couldnt
(sadness crosses her face
suddenly)
She lives real far away

The sadness disappears just as suddenly She holds out the circlet

SARAH
This is all you get

He grabs the circlet and bites it

HOGGLE
Bah Its paste

Something catches Sarahs eye It is one of the tiny FLOWER FAIRIES
She leans over for a better look

SARAH
No its not its plastic

Hoggles eyes light up at that and he grunts with satisfaction as he
strings the circlet onto his belt Sarah reaches out her hand to the
Fairy

SARAH
What a beautiful little thing

Hoggle reaches for the spray can

HOGGLE
Let me at it

Sarah is enraged
SARAH

You murderer How can you kill such beautiful
creatures
Just then the Fairy gives Sarah a vicious bite She shakes it off
her hand and cries out in pain

SARAH
It bit me

Hoggle quickly sprays the offending Fairy and it falls to the earth
screaming all the way

HOGGLE
Of course it bit ya Theres nuthin more
vicious than a flower fairy Any fool knows
that

Sarah sucks on her wounded hand and tries not to cry

HOGGLE
(sighs)
But you dont know nuthin do ya

A tear trickles down Sarahs cheek Hoggle sighs

HOGGLE
I got a feelin Im gonna regret this
(he stalks off)
Come with me an Ill show ya a way in

Sarah hurries after him As they walk along the endless wall Hoggle
looks at the circlet and polishes it on his sleeve

HOGGLE
(thrilled)
Plastic

EXT LABYRINTH — DAY

Another part of the wall Hoggle pushes a bush aside and shows Sarah
a tiny door She looks at it dubiously

HOGGLE
Thisll take ya into the maze thats the
first part of the labyrinth

SARAH
The first part What comes after that

Hoggle gets down on his knees and starts to crawl through the door
HOGGLE
Then theres the Garden Maze then the

Forbidden Forest

SARAH
That sounds inviting

He is through the door He is still talking but Sarah cant hear
him She quickly tries to follow
SARAH
Wait Wait I cant hear you

INT LABYRINTH — DAY
Hoggle is through the door

HOGGLE
then comes the castle

Sarahs head appears

HOGGLE
thats surely where Jareths keepin the
babe

He looks down at Sarah she is through the door to her waist and
straining to get the rest of herself through Hoggle sighs and grabs
her hand With a groan he tugs on her and pulls her through the
doorway She lands flat on her face

HOGGLE
Ya dont seem ta be able ta do nuthin’
without my help do ya

He chuckles and Sarah gives him a look that could kill as she gets
up and dusts herself off She looks around and the environment seems
rather benign The brick walls are open to the sky here and there a
flower peeks through a crack

SARAH
Oh I think I can handle it In fact this
place doesnt seem so bad at all

And with that she jauntily heads down the nearest corridor

INT CORRIDOR 1 — DAY

Sarah turns a corner and comes face to face with a FACE It is huge
and grotesque and protrudes out of the wall

FACE 1
Go back Go back before its too late

Sarah screams and backs away from it moving further down the
corridor She backs into something and whirls around It is ANOTHER
FACE

FACE 2
Turn back while you still can

Sarah turns and runs back the way she came

SARAH
Hoggle
INT LABYRINTH — DAY

Hoggle is still standing by the door an amused smile on his face
Sarah comes rushing toward him

SARAH
Oh Im so glad youre still here They were
horrible

HOGGLE

You dont mean the False Alarms do ya

He shakes his head and goes off in the direction that Sarah just
came from

HOGGLE
If ya gonna let a little thing like them
scare ya Missy ya havent a hope o makin
it to the castle
Sarah quickly follows

SARAH
False alarms
INT CORRIDOR 1 — DAY

The corridor of faces Hoggle enters and the Faces start in on their
routine Sarah comes up behind him shuddering at the ghastly sight

FACE 1
This is the path of no return

FACE 2
Beware Beware

HOGGLE
Just ignore ‘em

SARAH
Are you sure

Hoggle sighs and turns to the NEXT FACE

FACE 3
Abandon all hope

HOGGLE
Oh shut up will ya

Sarah is wide-eyed at Hoggles defiance

FACE 3
But I was just getting to the best part

HOGGLE
All right But dont expect us to pay any
attention
FACE 3
(winks at Sarah)

Youre going to love this Abandon all hope
ye who enter here for this is the road to
destruction
HOGGLE
(bored)

Very nice
Sarah is dumbstruck Hoggle takes her hand and yanks her along

FACE 3
Come back any time I mean youre doomed
doomed

INT CORRIDOR 2 — DAY
Hoggle and Sarah continuing down a similar corridor

HOGGLE
Ya see things arent always what they appear
to be around here Missy

SARAH
(shrugging)
Whatever All Im interested in is getting my
brother back from that creep

She starts to look around for something

HOGGLE
I admire yer determination but it takes
moren that to beat Jareth

Sarah picks up a rock

SARAH
Well maybe Im beginning to get the hang of
this labyrinth business

She takes the rock and uses it to mark an X on the floor

SARAH
See now Ill know which way we came in case
I get lost

HOGGLE
(sighs)
Missy goin back the way ya came is par fer
the course around here what ya want to do is
go forward

SARAH
Look Hoggle Ive got to find Freddie and I
dont need you to discourage me
HOGGLE
And I dont need to be wastin me time goin
around in circles with you

SARAH
Thats fine with me
(she starts off)
I know youre only after my ring anyway

She turns a corner and Hoggle looks after her hurt and pity
crossing his face He takes a few steps in her direction and an
officious little creature a BRICKKEEPER emerges from the brickwork
of the floor takes out the cobblestone that Sarah marked and
replaces it with the marked side hidden It looks up at Hoggle

BRICKKEEPER
Some people got no respect for property

Hoggle sticks his tongue out at the creature just as it goes back
into its hole

EXT AERIAL SHOT — DAY

The white bird flies over the maze and WE SEE Sarah marching along
She thinks shes going forward but shes heading right for Hoggle
INT CORRIDOR 2 — DAY

Sarah emerges into the corridor and comes face to face with Hoggle

SARAH
But

She whirls around to look behind her then back at Hoggle again
SARAH
but you were just behind me Im sure of

it

Hoggle shakes his head as she runs by him and looks down at the
floor

SARAH
My mark It was right here

Hoggle comes up beside her
HOGGLE
I told ya Missy Things arent what they

appear to be around here

JARETH (VO)
Except when they are
ANOTHER ANGLE

Jareth in all his glory Sarah and Hoggle whirl around and both
gasp with surprise and fear

JARETH
We meet again Sarah

SARAH
Wheres Freddie What have you done with
him

She starts to rush toward Jareth but Hoggle holds her back

JARETH
Nothing yet

He walks toward them and they automatically step backwards He looks
down at Hoggle

JARETH
And what have we here Hoghead isnt it
Hoggle is humiliated
HOGGLE

Me names Hoggle

JARETH
Ah yes Now I remember
(he moves closer to
Hoggle)
Youre the greedy little coward who lives
outside the gate Shouldnt you be back there
minding your own business Hedgehog

He chucks Hoggle under the chin and is quite rough about it Hoggle
fumes silently Sarah doesnt like this

SARAH
Why why dont you pick on someone your own
size

He looks her up and down

JARETH
Whom did you have in mind

Sarah tries to brazen it out
SARAH
I dont have time for any games I want
Freddie and I want him now
Jareth throws back his head and laughs
JARETH

Ah Freddie An adorable little imp Im
really growing rather fond of him
SARAH
Where is he

JARETH
Hes in my castle and seems to be enjoying
himself immensely

He ambles toward them and they cant help themselves they both step
backwards

JARETH
In fact he likes being with goblins so much
Im considering turning him into one

Sarah thinks this is crazy

SARAH
You cant do that

JARETH
(grinning)

Oh yes I can

Sarah looks down at Hoggle and speaks under her breath

SARAH
Can he
Hoggle nods glumly
JARETH
But lets make it interesting I wont do it
for thirteen hours If you make it to the

castle before then you might be able to save
him If not well I think little Freddie

will mike an adorable goblin Prince dont
you

He laughs and holds up both hands and WE SEE that they are empty He
then closes them and when he opens them again there is a gold watch
in one hand He throws it to Sarah but Hoggle intercepts it and
eyes it greedily Annoyed Sarah snatches it out of his hand She
looks at it and sees that it has 13 hours marked on it When she
looks up again Jareth is gone

WORM (VO)
Well good riddance to bad rubbish

Sarah and Hoggle both jump and then look at where the voice is
coming from It is a little WORM poking its head out of a hole in
the brickwork

WORM
Thats what the missus always says she does
Why the last time she found that one around
here she sent him packing

SARAH
Jareth
WORM
She dont take to his kind of nonsense
thats for sure Now how about a nice cup of
tea The missus has a kettle on

Sarah looks down at Hoggle who shrugs She then looks up at the
worm and gives him a beaming smile

INT CORRIDOR 2 — DAY
Sarah and Hoggle are sitting on the floor

SARAH
Do you think Jareth will give Freddie back if
I make it on time

HOGGLE
Its hard to say Missy But if I were you
Id worry ‘bout first things first

SARAH
What do you mean

HOGGLE
I means ya got ta find the castle before ya
can go savin the babe and I mean ta see that
ya do

Sarah is thrilled and leans over and gives him a kiss on the cheek

SARAH
Oh Hoggle Thank you thank you so much

Hoggle gets all flustered and tries to act gruff

HOGGLE
Seems to me I could be gettin that ring from
ya after all if I plays me cards right

Sarah regards him affectionately

SARAH
I know you dont mean that Youre helping me
because youre really nice

HOGGLE
I aint nice I just likes the way ya stood
up ta him is all
(he is thoughtful for a
moment almost to himself)
Too bad moreve us havent had the guts to do
the same

The worm reappears
WORM

How about a biscuit The missus just took a
fresh batch out of the oven
SARAH
Thanks but we really dont have any time
Weve got to get to the castle

HOGGLE
Ya wouldnt happen to know a shortcut would
ya

WORM

Well you might try taking that first left
Sarah and Hoggle look down the corridor

SARAH
But there isnt any left turn

Just then a strange FIGURE seems to come through the left wall and
walks toward them He is dressed in long flowing robes and wears a
hat shaped like a bird

WORM
See theres a left turn right there where
that Wise One just came in

SARAH
A Wise One Maybe he knows the best way to
the castle

HOGGLE
I wouldnt bet on it

But Sarah is excited about the possibility of getting more help

SARAH
Excuse me Sir Could you tell us the best
way to get to the castle

WISE ONE
The best way to the castle hmmm Im glad
you asked that question

To Sarahs and Hoggles surprise the hat joins into the
conversation

HAT
Now youve done it gone and asked him a
question Well be here all day

WISE ONE
A castle or fortress or as it is sometimes
known a stronghold or citadel — or that
which has a turret and barbican but usually
not a portcullis

HAT
What did I tell you Theres no stopping him
now
WISE ONE
often there is a rampart or bulwark and
then a parapet — perchance an actual vallum
or counterscarp

HAT
Shut up down there

WISE ONE

- and for entrenchment a moat drawbridge
and sally-port

Sarah looks at Hoggle

SARAH
This was not one of my better ideas

HAT
Well I told you that didnt I But nobody
ever listens to me

He looks down at the still mumbling Wise One

HAT
Enough Nobody cares

The Wise One blinks and looks at Sarah and Hoggle

WISE ONE
Did one of you say something

Sarah thinks quickly

SARAH
Oh no We never talk to strangers

WISE ONE
Thats very wise An idea worth savoring

Hoggle nudges him

HOGGLE
Yeah but keep it under your hat

Hoggle thinks this is hilarious The hat doesnt

HAT
Ve-ry funny

The Wise One continues on his way

WISE ONE
The stranger hmm Im glad you brought that
up The stranger one not indigenous also
known as the alien or one from beyond the
sea

HAT
(hysterical)
I quit I cant take it anymore
And then they are gone passing through the righthand wall as if it
wasnt there Sarah watches after them stunned

SARAH
How did he do that

HOGGLE
And how can we make sure he doesnt come
back

Sarah gives him a look and turns to the worm

WORM
Just go over to that bit of wall there and
walk right through it The important thing is
to forget what you think you know It doesnt
apply around here

Sarah and Hoggle walk down to the part of the wall where the Wise
One entered Once there they can see that a section of the wall is
actually a passageway-width behind the rest of the wall Sarah yells
back to the worm

SARAH
Thank you And tell the missus were sorry we
missed her biscuits

And then they walk through the wall and are gone

INT CORRIDOR 3 — DAY

Sarah and Hoggle appear through the wall and Sarah laughs with
delight Hoggle wasnt as pleased with the experience and feels the
wall as if testing to see if it really happened Sarah sees that
they are in a corridor where the walls are crumbling and she climbs
up to the top of one and looks over

ANOTHER ANGLE
SARAHS POV — THE TURRETS OF THE CASTLE
SARAH
(excited)

I can see the castle It doesnt look far at

all
Hoggle is still feeling around the wall trying to figure out how
they got there Sarah jumps down and starts to run down the

corridor

SARAH
Come on Hoggle Lets go

Hoggle sees her retreating figure and hurries after her
INT CASTLE — DAY

Jareths great hall He stands by a window and looks out over the
labyrinth — from this vantage point he can see clear across it the
hovels that surround the castle walls the arid plain that leads to
the dense forest encircling that the complex maze He seems lost
in thought The white bird enters the window and lands on his
shoulder Behind him Freddie is having a grand time His slippery
crawl is too much for the Goblins that scurry about trying to mind
him Meanwhile a particularly stupid looking GOBLIN begins to
approach Jareth He saunters across the room and is stopped short by
a FEMALE GOBLIN She grabs hold of his shirt and hisses a warning

FEMALE GOBLIN
Remember Its bow and scrape bow and
scrape

The stupid Goblin nods and she lets him go He then continues his
approach to Jareth only this time he does a little bow and then
scrapes his foot across the floor then repeats the action
STUPID GOBLIN
(to himself)
Bow n scrape bow n scrape

Jareth turns and sees the Goblin

JARETH
Well what is it

The Goblin cant answer and do his bow-and-scrape at the same time
so continues his painfully slow approach

STUPID GOBLIN
- bow n scrape bow n scrape

Annoyed Jareth walks over to the Goblin and lifts him up by his
shirt front The Goblin is still bowing

JARETH
I said what is it

STUPID GOBLIN

Th the girl and Hoggle sire Th
theyre halfway th through th the
maze

Jareth drops the Goblin hard on the floor Freddie sees this and
laughs with delight Jareth walks over and scoops the baby up in his
arms He then carries him over to the window He calls over to an
ARMED GOBLIN by the door

JARETH
I think its time they had some company

ARMED GOBLIN
Yes Sir

He then salutes causing his visor to close on his face then
stumbles around looking for the door Jareth shakes his head
JARETH

Youll make a much better goblin than that

wont you Freddie
Freddies response is to clap his sticky babys hand on to Jareths
face Jareth pretending he doesnt mind carefully removes it He
then looks down to the courtyard below
EXT CASTLE — DAY
JARETHS POV

ARMED GOBLINS are pouring out of the castle

EXT CORRIDOR 4 — DAY

Sarah and Hoggle are striding down a corridor They are about to
come to a corner

SARAH
Are you sure Jareth can turn Freddie into a
goblin I mean thats really weird

They turn the corner and Hoggle stops short Sarah becomes alarmed

SARAH
What is it

Hoggle gestures for her to be quiet and then we can hear what he
hears — marching They look back the way they came

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAHS AND HOGGLES POV

A BATTALION OF ARMED Goblins marching right towards them

ANOTHER ANGLE

They look at each other then turn and run Hoggle tries to get
through the wall the way the worm showed them

HOGGLE
(quoting the worm)
Just forget what you think you know and

He smacks headlong into the wall He stops to rub his nose and Sarah
flies by him

SARAH
Come on
INT CASTLE — DAY

Freddie is now sitting on the lap of a GOBLIN happily bopping it on
the nose Jareth snaps his fingers and a group of sleepy MUSICIANS
in the corner stumble over themselves to pick up their instruments
They begin to play and Jareth looks out the window and begins a
song He sings about the labyrinth what it is — his domain and
what it is to others — a test a proving-ground not for the faint
of heart

INT MAZE MONTAGE — DAY

While Jareth sings Sarah and Hoggle try to escape from the Goblins
They get a lead on them for a while and come to another corridor
with crumbling walls They scamper up to get a look at their
position and see dust rising from several parts of the maze The
Goblins are everywhere

In another corridor they are stopped in their tracks by DOZENS OF
LITTLE FUZZY CREATURES who scurry towards them out of the way of the
oncoming Goblins They turn and run back the way they came and as
they do WALL CREATURES chatter nervously and then disappear into the
cracks between the bricks

In a corridor with very short walls they are able to see the tips of
spears on either side of them going in the opposite direction

They enter a corridor with several arches curving over it forming
small intermittent bridges Thinking they are safe they stop for a
breath and soon realize that a battalion is right behind them They
scurry up the walls and as the song comes to an end they each lie
across an arch hopefully out of sight of the Goblins below

INT ARCHED CORRIDOR — DAY

Sarah and Hoggle huddle above the corridor on their arches as TWO
GOBLINS bring up the rear

GOBLIN 1
I can kill better than you can

GOBLIN 2
But Im better at maiming Everybody says so

And they are gone Shaken Sarah and Hoggle slide down from their
hiding places

SARAH
Do you think theyre gone

HOGGLE
Sure they are Goblins aint known fer their
intelligence ya know They has as much
trouble findin their way through the maze as
you do

He folds his arms and leans against the wall
SARAH
Im not sure but I think you just called me
stupid

Suddenly Hoggle yells and disappears He has accidentally leaned on
another secret wall opening Sarah quickly follows

INT CORRIDOR 5 — DAY

Hoggle and Sarah are now in the long circular corridor that divides
the maze from the beginning of the second ring of the labyrinth —
the Garden Maze

HOGGLE
(excited)
I think I know where we are

SARAH
Thatll be a nice change

He ignores her and looks around excitedly

HOGGLE
This place is the end o the maze That means
were near the entrance ta the second ring o
the labyrinth

SARAH
The second ring Whats that

Hoggle starts down the corridor

HOGGLE

(happily)
The Garden Maze

SARAH
(gloomy )
Sounds like a great place whats it like

HOGGLE
Dont know I aint never made it this far
before

He is skipping happily down the corridor when Sarah hears something
It is a strange clanking sound

SARAH
(frightened)
Hoggle Whats that sound

Hoggle stops skipping and sighs
HOGGLE
Now dont go gettin all girly on me Missy

now that wes finally safe

SARAH
So you think were safe do you
HOGGLE
(annoyed)
Didnt I just say so

SARAH
Then tell me what you think of that

Sarah points behind them where the clanking noise is coming from It
is now much louder Hoggle comes over to her and takes a better
look He screams

ANOTHER ANGLE

THEIR POV — A SLASHING MACHINE

Is coming right towards them (A slashing wall is made up of rows of
furiously spinning knives and chopping cleavers and has brushes
along the bottom to clean up whatever it encounters in its path)
And there is no way around it because it completely fills the
corridor

ANOTHER ANGLE

Hoggle desperately tries to walk through the wall the way they came
in but it is to no avail He just keeps smashing his face Sarah

starts to run for it

SARAH
Come on

Hoggle follows every so often trying and failing to get through
the wall
ANOTHER ANGLE

Sarah who is far ahead of Hoggle comes to a door And hanging on a
hook next to it is a bunch of keys She looks back at Hoggle

SARAH
Hoggle hurry
ANOTHER ANGLE
SARAHS POV
Hoggle running toward her and making slow but steady progress
toward them both — the slashing machine
ANOTHER ANGLE

Sarah fumbles with the keys furiously trying key after key in the
door but to no avail She is terrified

SARAH
None of the keys work
Desperate she starts banging on the door Hoggle is just a few
yards away from her

HOGGLE
Why dont you just try it

He then tries once more to walk through the wall Sarah tries the
knob and sure enough it opens She is delighted What she doesnt
see is Hoggle suddenly disappearing through the floor

SARAH
Its open Hog

She turns around and he is gone And the slashing machine is just a
few yards away She screams and in her terror falls backwards
through the door It slams shut just as the slashing machine reaches
it WE CAN SEE that FOUR GOBLINS in sanitation workers uniforms have
been pushing the machine all along They grunt and strain cranking
the wheels that turn the knives and pushing all at the same time

INT PICTURE GALLERY — DAY

Sarah emerges into a large room The walls are covered with large
paintings in ornate gilt frames She is a bit stunned by the clone
call with the slashing machine as she approaches the first painting

SARAH
(to herself)
What in the world

She stops short in front of the first painting and cannot believe
her eyes It is a painting of the watch with 13 hours on it The
hour hand is on the 9 Sarah fumbles into her pocket and finds the
watch that Jareth gave her It also has the hour hand on the 9

SARAH
Only 9 hours left

The next picture is of a baby surrounded by gruesome Goblins On
closer inspection the baby is obviously Freddie She chokes back a
sob and runs over to the next one it is a picture of a rotunda with
staircases going off in all different directions on different planes
of gravity It is an Escher room and a closer look shows a GOBLIN
happily standing on the ceiling She shakes her head and goes by the
next painting and gasps involuntarily It is a compelling portrait
of Jareth and she moves even closer Then she shakes herself out of
it

ANOTHER ANGLE
THE PORTRAITS POV

Sarah wills herself away and moves on and we hear the sound of
Jareths breathing
ANOTHER ANGLE

Sarah is nervous and eagerly looks for a way out She rushes by
another painting giving it merely a glance But something makes her
go back for a better look It is of a lovely manicured hedge maze
In the distance WE CAN SEE the turrets of Jareths castle And in
the sky nearby flies a beautiful WHITE BIRD And then Sarah is
amazed by what she sees A closer look at the painting reveals that
the white bird is flying It moves over the hedges and WE SEE a
FIGURE waving

SARAH
Hoggle

Sarah disturbed backs away from the painting And then because it
really is as wonderful as it is scary she goes back for another
look and over her shoulder WE CAN SEE Hoggle waving and we hear his
tiny voice

HOGGLE
Missy Over here This is the way to the
castle

And Sarah strains to hear and leans toward the painting stretching
her hand out and touching the painting which makes it turn into a
shimmering wall that her hand goes right through And then she
disappears right through the painting

ANOTHER ANGLE — THE GALLERY

And Jareths portrait is now blank

EXT HEDGE MAZE — DAY
Sarah rushes up to Hoggle and throws her arms around him

SARAH
What happened to you I was afraid Id never
see you again

HOGGLE
Ya know that trick with the wall Damn if it
dont work with the floor as well

Sarah laughs and hugs him again

INT HEDGE MAZE — DAY

Sarah and Hoggle have been walking through the maze a long time
They are tired and bedraggled Sarah pulls the watch out of her
pocket and sighs

SARAH
An hours gone by and I dont think were
more than four feet from where we started
HOGGLE
Thats ‘cause ya wont do what I tells ya
Its clear as day we should be goin this
way

He turns a corner and walks smack into a hedge dead end He howls in
pain and Sarah sighs and follows him

ANOTHER ANGLE

Hoggle disentangling himself from the hedge

SARAH
Got any more suggestions

Before Hoggle can answer they are interrupted by a terrible gut-
wrenching scream It is positively unearthly Sarah whirls around

SARAH
It sounds like it came from over there

Hoggle points in the opposite direction

HOGGLE
Then lets go this way

Sarah frowns at him as the scream begins again

SARAH
Hoggle It sounds like someones being hurt

HOGGLE
Exactly why we should be headin in the
othermost direction

Sarah shakes her head in disgust and runs off as the screams become
more unbearable

ANOTHER ANGLE

Sarah running through the hedge maze Driven by the sound of the
screams she has an unconscious ability to find her way through
Hoggle trying to keep up with her keeps running into dead ends

ANOTHER ANGLE

Sarah emerging from the maze She is stopped in her tracks by what
she sees and quickly covers her mouth to prevent herself from
screaming Hoggle emerges a moment later barely pauses before he
heads right back into the maze
EXT CLEARING — DAY
SARAHS POV

FOUR GOBLINS are torturing a huge CREATURE (LUDO) that they have
hung by his ankle from a tree limb They have also taken pains to
bind the creature who it is obvious could take an most of them and
win in a fairer fight He is about nine feet tall powerfully built
and his screams of frustrated agony are truly unbearable The
Goblins have devised a unique method of harassing him They all
carry long sticks which have small fierce biting CREATURES on the
end of them The Goblins bat their sticks at Ludo who bellows and
tries to swat back Since he is tied the NIPPERS are free to bite
him whenever they get near

ANOTHER ANGLE
Sarah distraught peeking out from behind a hedge

SARAH
The poor thing

Hoggle peeks out from behind Sarah then quickly ducks back Sarah
looks for a way to stop the torture She picks up a rock and
carefully aims it at the nearest Goblin It hits his head and knocks
his helmet visor over his eyes Blinded the Goblin lurches around
swinging his nipper stick at the other three

BLINDED GOBLIN
Hey Who turned out the lights

The other goblins see a new target and poke their nipper sticks
towards him He takes off and runs blindly into the hedge maze The
other three chase him carrying the nipper sticks upright no that WE
CAN SEE their progress in the background

ANOTHER ANGLE

Sarah desperately tries to untie the huge knot that holds Ludo
suspended upside down She cant undo it and yells for Hoggle

SARAH
Get out here you coward

Hoggle appears from behind his hedge He hesitates then pulls a
dagger from his belt and joins Sarah He cuts through the rope in
one hack and Ludo falls to the ground with a thud

ANOTHER ANGLE
The nipper sticks start yammering away as they see Sarah and Hoggle

freeing Ludo over the top of the hedge The Goblin chase stops and
they head back to the clearing Hoggle dives for the bushes but a
determined Sarah stays and pulls off the ropes When Ludo is free
he picks up a huge log As the four Goblins come roaring back into
the clearing Ludo waves the log over his head The Goblin charge
immediately shifts into a Goblin retreat the nipper sticks yipping
in fear

ANOTHER ANGLE

Ludo puts down the log and sits his big shaggy head hanging down
He taken one hand and wipes away a tear

LUDO
Ludo hurt

Sarahs heart breaks This thing is the ultimate stuffed animal

SARAH
Is that your name Ludo

He nods and wipes away another tear

LUDO
Goblins mean to Ludo

SARAH
Oh I know They were terribly mean to you
(she moves closer and pats
his arm)
But its all right now

Ludo sniffs and then breaks into the most endearing big dumb smile
you have ever seen

LUDO
Friend
SARAH
Thats right Ludo Im your friend Im
Sarah
LUDO
Sarah friend

Hoggle has come out from hiding during this exchange He finds the
whole scene a bit nauseating And an unnecessary nuisance If
theres one thing he doesnt want its competition for Sarah

HOGGLE
I think Im about ta be sick

They ignore him and Ludo grins for all hes worth as Sarah beams up
at him Hoggle pulls her over to one side

HOGGLE
I hope yer not thinkin o lettin the beast
traipse along Missy Hell just slow us up
SARAH
Are you kidding Hell be a great help The
goblins are scared of him because hes so
fierce

Just then Ludo shyly offers Sarah a flower that he has just picked
for her She takes it and smiles at him

HOGGLE
(sarcastically)
I sees what ya mean

Sarah shrugs and gives Ludo a pat Hoggle sighs with frustration

HOGGLE
I just thinks we was doin fine on our own

SARAH
And we can do even better with Ludo
(turns to Ludo)
You want to help me save my baby brother
dont you Ludo

LUDO
Save baby Good

Sarah nods with satisfaction and strides into the hedge maze Ludo
right behind her Hoggle follows clearly unhappy
EXT FOREST GATE — DAY

Sarah Hoggle and Ludo come out of the hedge maze and see a wall
with two Sarah-sized doors in it

HOGGLE
This is it the entrance ta the Forbidden
Forest All we gotta do is pick a door

SARAH
What difference does it make Lets just go

Ludo quickly steps between Sarah and the doors

LUDO
One door good One door bad
HOGGLE
Well thats great news
(to Ludo)

Dont suppose ya know which is which

Sarah skirts around Ludo and goes up to the doors for a closer look
at them

LUDO
One door good One door
HOGGLE
All right ya walkin mountain Ya made ya
point

ANOTHER ANGLE

Sarah ignores the bickering behind her and examines the doors Each
one has a DOOR KNOCKER on it Both Knockers are carved into faces
except one has the ring going through its ears and the other has it
stuck in its mouth

The Knocker

Sarah jumps

Sarah turns

SARAH
(to herself)
I guess once you choose a door all you
have to do is knock
with the ring through its ears speaks

KNOCKER 1
Are you addressing me

back stunned

SARAH
You can talk

KNOCKER 1
What What Youll have to speak up

KNOCKER 2

SARAH

KNOCKER 2

Sarah shakes her head in amazement

ANOTHER ANGLE

The boys are still at it

HOGGLE
If yer so smart why not show us another way
inta the forest

LUDO
Ludo not know
HOGGLE
That figures dont it
(he turns his back on
Ludo fuming)
Why the Missy wants an overgrown hill o hair
fer a friend is beyond me

Ludo tries to make Hoggle feel better and pats him on the shoulder
Hoggle shakes his hand off with a growl

ANOTHER ANGLE
Sarah is excited

SARAH
I love it Talking doors
(to Knocker 1)
Are you the right door to the forest

KNOCKER 1
It doesnt do to ask me For some reason I
cant hear a thing
Sarah turns to Knocker 1
KNOCKER 1
No use asking him either All he does is
mumble

Knocker 2 gets very excited

KNOCKER 2
Thgt vrnf lcl

SARAH
I get it You cant talk with that ring in
your mouth
She removes the ring and looks at the face triumphantly
SARAH
Now tell me which one of you is the right

door to the forest

KNOCKER 2
Oh I am No question about it

SARAH
Great How do we get you to open up

KNOCKER 2
One merely has to knock

SARAH
Of course why didnt I think of that

She tries to get the ring back in its mouth
KNOCKER 2
Oh no you dont young lady Ive had just
about enough of that awful thing thank you
very much

SARAH
But how are we supposed to get through this
door if you wont let me knock on it

KNOCKER 2
Well I really couldnt say now could I

Sarah throws up her hands in disgust

KNOCKER 1
Oh do speak up both of you I cant hear a
thing

ANOTHER ANGLE
Hoggle and Ludo are still at it

HOGGLE
(conspiratorially)
Ya know even if she does get the door
open ya wont be able ta fit through Why
not make it easy on us all and take a hike

LUDO
Ludo Stay
Hoggle is disgusted
HOGGLE

Yer quite the speechifier aint ya

ANOTHER ANGLE
Sarah suddenly gives Knocker 2 an evil grin

SARAH
Are you sure there isnt anything I can do to
change your mind

KNOCKER 2
Absolutely not My lips are sealed

SARAH
Thats what I thought

The Knocker presses its lips firmly together Sarah deftly squeezes

its nose shut It sputters for air and finally has to open its mouth
before it suffocates Sarah shoves the ring in with a gleeful cry of
triumph She knocks and the door swings open

SARAH
Lets go
She goes through the door and Hoggle and Ludo race to follow They
both try to get through the door at the same time and get into such
a tangle that the door closes before they can straighten themselves
out

HOGGLE
Now youve done it

In a frenzy Hoggle starts banging on both doors
HOGGLE
Missy Missy wait
EXT FORBIDDEN FOREST — DAY
Sarah on the other side of the door Except on this side there is
no door just a long expanse of wall The forest is very dark and
as its name suggests very forbidding Sarah can hear Hoggle
calling but it is very faint
SARAH
(scared)
Hoggle

EXT FOREST GATE — DAY

Hoggle is beating on the doors with such a frenzy that the other
door swings open

HOGGLE
Im coming

He rushes through the door and disappears We can tell from his
voice that he is falling down a deep hole

HOGGLE
(echoed)

We hear a huge splash Then that door shuts and Ludo is all alone

LUDO
Sarah gone Hoggle gone

He is sad and confused A FIGURE emerges from the hedge maze and
begins to walk along the wall away from Ludo It is the Wise One
Ludo brightens and chases after them

LUDO
Wait

The Wise One stops and the hat looks Ludo up and down

HAT
This ought to be a good one

LUDO
Ludo need door
WISE ONE
You have need of a door do you Ah yes A
very useful thing the door also known as a
portal or threshold — and that which gives
access a gate or gangway

He continues walking and Ludo walks with him listening intently

WISE ONE
also an entrance or entry often
accompanied by a propylaeum

HAT
(sighs)
If only I had hands I could cover my ears
that is if I had ears

WISE ONE
not to be confused with a window or
fenestration

EXT FOREST — DAY
Sarah has waited long enough

SARAH
Hoggle Ludo where are you

She reaches into her pocket and looks at the watch The hour hand is
on the 7

SARAH
(whispers)
Oh Freddie
(she shoves the watch back
into her pocket)
Well you guys are going to have to catch up
with me ‘cause I cant wait

Then determined she strides off

INT HOLE — DAY

Hoggle is in a pool at the bottom of a deep hole in the ground
There is a ledge just above him and he splashes violently trying to
reach it

HOGGLE
Somebody help me I cant swim

EXT FOREST — DAY

Sarah is in a very thick creepy part of the woods She is clearly
lost She gets herself tangled in a thorn bush and struggles with
it to get herself free Finally she does and then frustrated sits
down on the ground
SARAH
Why does everything have to happen to me

But theres no time to think about that because she hears the sound
of a driving drum rhythm and then a wild-looking spindly leering
LITTLE CREATURE comes scampering through the trees and into the
clearing and then ANOTHER and ANOTHER and ANOTHER Sarah is
terrified as they approach her but then not so terrified because
the creatures arent doing anything except dancing wild loose-
limbed frenzied dancing Sarah laughs and cant help but be taken
in by the wild spectacle And then they begin to encircle her still
moving to the wild rhythm

SARAH
(laughing moving)
What are you

WILD THING 1
Were Wild Things baby Wild

WILD THING 2
Wild and free

WILD THING 3
Get down

And then more Wild Things appear and these produce instruments As
and turn the drum rhythm into a frenzied upbeat number

WILD THING 1
You call that wild I1l show you wild

And then he does an amazing thing to say the least He takes his
head off and rolls it along his arms from hand to hand like a
juggler then tosses it high in the air and deftly catches it on his
shoulders Sarah gasps and tries to get sway but another Wild Thing
pushes her back into the middle of the melee

WILD THING 2
Cut me some slack and move on back

And they do and moving to the pounding rhythm he takes his eyes
out of his head and waves them at Sarah He then tosses them on the
ground as if they were a pair of dice They land at Sarahs feet
looking straight up

WILD THING 2
Snake eyes

Sarah is fascinated and repelled And the beat gets hotter and the
frenzy more frenzied and she cant help getting a little wild
herself She begins to really dance

WILD THING 3
Thats it baby get wild and free But
youll never be as wild as me

And to prove it he takes his head off and begins to dribble it like
a basketball Wild Thing 1 leans over to Sarah and whispers
conspiratorily
WILD THING 1
I wouldnt call that really wild would you

SARAH
Well its uh sort of

WILD THING 1
Id call this wild

And he takes off his head puts it on the ground as if it were a
golf ball and then removes a leg and uses it as a golf club The
head goes flying right to Sarah Sarah catches the head then tries
to get it back to its body but the body dances into the middle of
all the other Wild Things and she cant find it So theres Sarah
running around like a chicken with two heads when suddenly the ears
start to flap and the head flies out of her hand A Wild Thing grabs
her hand and turns her around

WILD THING 2
That was wild baby
(he starts to dance)
Now how ‘bout gettin’ wild with me

But Sarah has had enough

SARAH
I think Ill sit this one out

WILD THING 1
Not with us you dont

WILD THING 2
‘Cause were wild

And then theyre all over her like a bunch of hyper puppies and
its really too much

SARAH
Enough Ive got to find the castle

WILD THING 2
Well why didnt you say so baby

WILD THING 3
Thats a wild idea

And then his head flies off and he has to quickly grab it and put it
back and meanwhile the others start pushing and pulling on Sarah and
propel her into the woods

WILD THING 1

They got some wild goings on at the castle
baby
INT HOLE — DAY

Hoggle is holding on to the ledge with his fingertips He doesnt
have the strength to hold on much longer and he looks down at the
water in mortal terror He begins to slip just as a door opens in
the sheer rock and Jareth enters accompanied by Goblins

JARETH
Well what have we here if it isnt little
Piggle

Hoggle screams and slips into the water He tries to struggle back
to the ledge but the Goblins push at him with poles laughing
maniacally

JARETH
Did the girl decide she doesnt need you now
that she has that beast

HOGGLE

(angry)
She wouldnt do nuthin like that

Jareth leans over the water laughing

JARETH
Dont you know she could never care for a
repulsive thing like you

Hoggle splashes and tries to stay afloat

HOGGLE
She does care Me n Sarah is friends

JARETH
Only until something better comes along
and Ive definitely got something better in
mind

HOGGLE
Dont you hurt her

Hoggle grabs on to the ledge and the gleeful Goblins push him back
down into the water

JARETH
What I do to her is my business and it is
inevitable

He grabs Hoggle by the shirt front and lifts him out of the water

JARETH
You can be with me or against me

HOGGLE
(terrified)
Wh what do I gotta do
JARETH
I doubt if she can make it to the castle in
time

He leans down and speaks directly into Hoggles face

JARETH
But just in case I want you to deliver her
to me

HOGGLE

Never Id rather die
Jareth sneers scornfully

JARETH
Then so you shall

He drops Hoggle back into the water The Goblins shriek with
delight Hoggle goes under and comes up sputtering

HOGGLE
Wait

Jareth was about to leave He turns back to Hoggle a look of
amusement on his face

HOGGLE
I gotta know what what youll do to her

He splashes pathetically in a desperate attempt to stay above water

JARETH
I will do what ever amuses me

He reaches into his cloak and brings out a perfect peach

JARETH
All you have to do is give her this

He tosses Hoggle the peach Hoggle catches it and immediately the
water starts to recede

JARETH
Youve made a very wise decision

He leaves followed by the Goblins

HOGGLE
I didnt decide nuthin

Hoggle stares forlornly at the peach and soon the water is gone and
he is sitting on cold damp ground
EXT FOREST — DAY

The Wild Things are leading Sarah on a rocky path She stumbles
along but they couldnt care less

SARAH
Are you sure this is the way to the castle

WILD THING 1
Oh did you say the castle

WILD THING 2
I thought she said hassle

WILD THING 3
I thought she said rassle

WILD THING 1
Rassle Thats a wild idea

He leaps on Sarah and she flings him off

SARAH
OK guys funs over

She starts to leave and they pull her back

WILD THING 2
Over Its just begun

And then the musicians are back and the dancing gets wilder than
ever The Wild Things totally surround Sarah and though they arent
hurting her they are definitely not letting her out What they do
is start throwing their heads at each other and switching them

WILD THINGS 1 2 and 3
Now this is really wild

ANOTHER ANGLE

A door opens in a nearby boulder and Ludo appears In the background
WE CAN SEE and hear the Wise One as he wanders off

WISE ONE
very often preceded by a porch or
portico also verandah and followed by a
vestibule otherwise known as an antechamber
or foyer

HAT
Why me

The door closes Ludo sees Sarah in the middle of this weirdness and
is just a bit confused Sarah sees him amidst the flying heads and
cries out in relief

SARAH
Ludo
LUDO
Sarah not want castle

SARAH
Are you kidding Get me out of here

Ludo approaches the Wild Things and grabs a head before it reaches
its target and calmly tosses it into the trees

WILD THING 3
Hey big fella Thats a little too wild

But theres no time to talk because Ludo calmly catches the other
heads and tosses them away The bodies go scurrying after their
heads followed by the Musicians Sarah is free

SARAH
Oh Ludo Im so glad youre here

She gives him a kiss and he beams

SARAH
Wheres Hoggle

LUDO
Hoggle in bad door

SARAH
Weve got to find him Do you think we can

Ludo is very confident He spent a lot of time with the Wise One

LUDO
Ludo knows doors

He ambles off with Sarah following
LUDO
Also portal or entrance
INT HOLE — DAY

Hoggle is more depressed than ever The peach is nowhere to be seen
Suddenly Ludos head appears above

LUDO
Hoggle all wet

Hoggle almost jumps out of his skin and then is totally outraged
HOGGLE
Aint that the clever observation ya feeble
excuse fer a thinkin creature

Sarah appears from behind Ludo

SARAH
Be nice Hoggle Or we wont get you out
Hoggles face lights up and all thoughts of anger are forgotten

HOGGLE
Missy

INT FOREST — DAY

Sarah Hoggle and Ludo march through thick overgrown forest They
do not know that they are being spied on by Jareths Goblins

INT CLEARING — DAY

The threesome emerge into a clearing and see that they have come to
a wide fissure that goes off in either direction as far as the eye
can see It is spanned by a rickety bridge held by two thick wooden
posts on either side of the gap Sarah eyes the bridge warily

SARAH
It doesnt look too strong but we dont have
much choice

Suddenly they are interrupted by a high-pitched but powerful voice

VOICE (VO)
Halt Halt or be slain forthwith

At first they dont see a thing and look around for the source of
the voice Then the imposing 18 inch high figure of DIDYMUS
resplendent in rakish hat and swashbuckling sword emerges from
behind one of the posts and stands in front of the bridge Ludo and
Sarah are dumbstruck Hoggle however is not at a loss for words

HOGGLE
Out of our way ya wretched little rodent

Didymus looks directly at Hoggle

DIDYMUS
You sir shall be the first to feel the
point of my sword

Hoggle snorts with derision and Sarah tries a more sensible
approach

SARAH
Please we really have to cross this bridge
Its a matter of life and death

Didymus shrugs elegantly

DIDYMUS
Under any other circumstances I would hasten
to oblige you fair damsel for your mission
sounds a worthy one

SARAH
Oh it is
DIDYMUS
But I am sworn Without my permission none
may pass

Sarah throws up her hands and Hoggle mumbles under his breath It
appears to be up to Ludo to break the deadlock He lifts Didymus up
into the air and moves him to one side They then start to walk
toward the bridge and Didymus chases them brandishing his sword

DIDYMUS
You dishonor me varlets En garde

To his chagrin they ignore him and keep walking

DIDYMUS
Rapscallions Duel or die

This gets their attention and they turn to look at him annoyed

HOGGLE
What is this weasel babblin about

It is too much for Didymus He flings himself at Hoggle with a
mighty war cry Hoggle tries to run for it but Didymus is right
behind him administering more than a few pinpricks in embarrassing
places Hoggle dives behind a bush and Didymus sniffs at his
cowardice He comes back and faces Ludo

DIDYMUS
It is you I want rogue of rogues You who
dealt me the gravest affront

And with that he jabs Ludo in the foot Ludo is stunned and
howling begins to hop on his good foot Didymus his head thrown
back for a triumphant yell goes after Ludo with his sword flashing
and there is nothing for Ludo to do but pick up a branch and defend
himself It is the most mismatched duel in the history of chivalrous
absurdity Didymus moving at an incredible speed parrying the mighty
swipes of Ludos branch with great skill — and no small amount of
difficulty And Ludo fending off the incessant pinpricks of the
little sword leaping about with surprising agility — and at a rate
that exhausts him totally Finally the two of them breathing
heavily lower their weapons And to everyones surprise Didymus
throws down his sword

DIDYMUS
I no longer wish to slay you for you are a
truly noble knight

Then Didymus strides up to him and craning his neck attempts to
look Ludo in the eyes

DIDYMUS
Destroy me if you will

Ludo quickly drops his branch in response The whole thing has upset
his gentle nature terribly Didymus then holds out a tiny paw
DIDYMUS
Never have I met my match in battle yet you
noble knight have fought me to a standstill

Ludo kneels and tentatively takes Didymus paw into his own huge
hand

DIDYMUS
Let us be brothers henceforth and fight for
the right as one

Sarah cheers and Hoggle unimpressed rubs his sore rear Ludo
smiles from ear to ear

LUDO
Ludo get brother

Then he and Didymus exchange the ritual kiss on each cheek which in
their case is not easily accomplished Sarah then turns practical

SARAH
Well now that thats settled lets get
going

She heads for the bridge but Didymus blocks her way

DIDYMUS
You forget my sacred vow my lady I cannot
let you pass

Sarah is incensed

SARAH
But you said Ludo was your brother How can
you refuse him

DIDYMUS
I have taken an oath I must defend it to the
death

Hoggle enraged turns on Ludo

HOGGLE
Some brother he turned out ta be

LUDO
Brother good

HOGGLE
Well if hes so good why wont he let us
get on with our business

Ludo scratches his head He has no idea Sarah sits down beside the
crestfallen Didymus

SARAH
OK lets handle this thing logically What
exactly have you sworn

Didymus brandishes his sword
DIDYMUS
I have sworn with my life-blood no one shall
pass this way without my permission

SARAH
Then may we have your permission

Didymus is stunned Hoggle and Ludo barely breathe Slowly Didymus
looks all around and then with a courage greater than any he has
ever had to call on before he says it

DIDYMUS
Yes

And the sky doesnt fall and the earth doesnt heave and
everything is exactly as it should be

SARAH
Thank you

Didymus breathes a sigh of relief and steps aside to let them pass
Ludo is the first one to go over and that is unfortunate Because
the rickety bridge collapses under his weight Sarah and Hoggle jump
back on the ground near Didymus just in time and poor Ludo swings
over the deep fissure hanging on to one of the ropes that held the
bridge With a mighty effort he hoists himself up on to the opposite
side and looks forlornly over at the others

SARAH
Oh no

Sarah crumples to the ground and stares miserably at the broken
bridge

HOGGLE
Now see what ya done ya mush-brained
mammoth

DIDYMUS

I Sir Didymus take responsibility for the
actions of my brother my lady Lash out at
me if you must

SARAH
Im not mad at Ludo Sir Didymus Im just
upset because time is running out and I have
to rescue my baby brother

Didymus is struck to the very roots of his chivalry

DIDYMUS
You mean to rescue a child

SARAH
The goblin king took him and Ive only
got

She takes out the watch The hour hand is on the 5
SARAH
five hours to get him back

Didymus yells across to Ludo

DIDYMUS
Is this your quest too my brother

LUDO
Save baby

Didymus is overwhelmed

DIDYMUS
Then I shall join you lady I am at your
service upon my sword

He bows low before Sarah and she smiles

SARAH
I happily accept your fealty Sir Didymus

Hoggle frowns with displeasure at this latest development

HOGGLE
This is all well an good Missy But we
still got one little problem

They all look across the fissure at Ludo

LUDO
Ludo friends

HOGGLE
Yes yes Were friends Very nice Whats
that got ta do with us gettin over there
without a bridge

LUDO
Rocks friends

HOGGLE
Were wastin our time Missy Lets you an
me go find another

He is interrupted by Ludo bellowing which is followed by a
sympathetic rumbling Suddenly rocks pile in from both directions
until there is a pile in the fissure high enough for them to walk
across

LUDO
Rocks friends

SARAH
(laughing)
They sure are Ludo

She skips happily across followed by a sullen Hoggle Didymus
whistles and is quickly joined by a tail-wagging SHEEPDOG Sarah
gasps he is the spitting image of her own Merlin
SARAH
Its

DIDYMUS
Ambrosius My noble steed

Sarah laughs and shrugs Nothing surprises her in the labyrinth

EXT FOREST — NIGHT

The edge of the forest From here you can see the castle in the
distance just across the dry cracked plain The sky is full of
stars Sarah Hoggle Ludo and Didymus are sitting around a fire

DIDYMUS
What will you do after we save the child my
lady

SARAH

Take him home of course That is if I can
figure out how

DIDYMUS
What is your kingdom like Do you have many
knights to defend your honor

SARAH
Not even one

DIDYMUS
It cannot be What bitter place is this that
does such dishonor to my lady

SARAH
Its a place where where nobody really
sees me
LUDO
Ludo see Sarah
SARAH
(laughs)

I know you do Ludo

(she turns to Didymus)
And thanks to you Sir Didymus I finally
have a knight

He bows graciously Hoggle who has been watching this scene feels
rejected and miserable He gets up and wanders away from the fire
After a moment Sarah follows him

SARAH
Dont you feel like resting

HOGGLE
I aint tired

SARAH
Me neither What I am is hungry
Hoggle winces but Sarah doesnt notice Sarah looks back at Ludo and
Didymus Ludo lies on his back snoring loudly Didymus dozes against
Ambrosius side

SARAH
Theyre both wonderful arent they

HOGGLE
Theyre alright

SARAH
Theyre more than that Theyre loyal and
strong and with their help Im going to

beat Jareth
Hoggle shakes his head sadly Sarah speaks as an afterthought

SARAH
And yours too of course

HOGGLE
I aint no fighter

She shrugs that off and wanders away to look out at the castle
Hoggle goes through agony for a moment and then makes a decision

HOGGLE
Missy if youre hungry

He holds out the peach that Jareth gave him the worlds most
delicious looking peach

SARAH
Oh great

She happily taken the peach and bites It takes everything Hoggle
has to not put his hands over his ears She takes another bite and
then stumbles

SARAH
(laughing)
Everythings dancing

She looks up at the sky exhilarated

SARAH
Even the stars are dancing

Hoggle turns and walks back to the fire Sarah stumbles about as she
gazes happily at the sky

INT CASTLE — NIGHT

Freddie is leading the Goblins on a merry chase He crawls around
the room pulling things off shelves A GOBLIN is on his hands and
knees in front of Jareth polishing his boots Jareth kicks the
Goblin and sends him flying across the room This makes Freddie
laugh and he pulls a book off the shelf and throws it It hits a
Goblin on the head Jareth scoops up Freddie and puts him in his
cradle He sits down next to him

JARETH
Little goblin-to-be I have something to
amuse you

He waves his hands in front of Freddie and suddenly beautiful
crystalline balls appear in them He runs them over his fingers like
so many coins their molten light so dazzling that Freddie kicks up
his legs with excitement And WE CAN SEE that at the end of his
pajamas are two wizened goblin feet Jareth laughs and flings the
balls into the air and they turn into bubbles beautiful
mesmerizing bubbles

JARETH
Soon little one Very very soon

And they both watch the bubbles as they fly out the window and over
the labyrinth coldly beautiful against the darkening sky

EXT FOREST — NIGHT

Sarahs hand opens slowly and the half-eaten peach falls to the
ground She stares out into the sky mesmerized The bubbles are
approaching dazzling dancing bubbles And then she hears music
haunting spell-casting music The bubbles come closer and WE CAN
SEE that each one contains a TWIRLING DANCER a Dancer just like the
one in Sarahs music box She gets up and follows them

ANOTHER ANGLE
Hoggle watching from the woods
HOGGLE
Damn you Jareth
(he turns and begins to
walk away)
And damn me too
ANOTHER ANGLE
A bubble with Sarah inside it floating through the sky She
appears enchanted and she begins to twirl just like the other
Dancers
EXT BALLROOM — NIGHT
A giant bubble with a magnificent ballroom inside it Tiny bubbles
rush to join it In one of them is Sarah

INT BALLROOM — NIGHT

The music changes and now Sarah is inside the ballroom It is a
magnificent spectacle with all the beauty and decadence of an 118th
Century Venetian ball Magnificently dressed Dancers swirl to the
music in an incredibly opulent setting But when you look closer you
sense decay just beneath the surface things are threadbare faded
The GUESTS wear masks that are elegant parodies of goblin faces
giving them all a slightly sinister look And there is something
very provocative about all of them the women have bare shoulders
and daring decolletage many of the men have their shirts open to
the waist Some of them lounge against the wall indolently and there
is the feeling that the party has been going on all night In this
setting Sarah is the picture of innocence Two women snickering
behind their fans as Sarah approaches and she is suddenly terribly
self-conscious How plain She feels amidst all this She looks into
one of the many mirrors that line the ballroom and sighs at her
image Then suddenly she sees something in the mirror that makes her
gasp

ANOTHER ANGLE

The mirror and in it the reflection of a resplendent Jareth dancing
with a particularly exotic-looking WOMAN Sarah whirls around
trying to get another glimpse of Jareth She is so intent on trying
to see him that she doesnt notice that she is being stared at
brazenly by a YOUNG MAN leaning against the wall He moves next to
her and whispers something into her ear She hurries away shocked
and the YOUNG MAN throws back his head and laughs And Jareth sees
the whole thing

ANOTHER ANGLE

Sarah is approached by a MIDDLE-AGED MAN who has a box hanging at
waist height from a ribbon around his neck It looks like Sarahs
music box She looks down at it with interest and he throws open the
cover But there is no dancer inside instead there is a stick
carved like a snake It shoots out at Sarah and she cries out and
backs away All the people around her laugh and she moves hurriedly
on Jareth who is dancing with an even more beautiful woman than
before watches Sarah

ANOTHER ANGLE

Sarah is looking for Jareth She spots him and sees him whisper
something to his partner who smiles knowingly from beneath her mask
and licks her lips Sarah blushes and turns away and finds herself
looking into another mirror But in the reflection Jareth isnt
with a partner He is standing alone the DANCERS a whirling blur
around him and he is looking straight at her Sarah whirling
around to face the crowd and she sees Jareth with yet a THIRD
BEAUTY And then she realizes that it is herself In a trance-like
state she moves through the crowd to get a better look
ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAHS POV

She is whirling in Jareths arms and she is the most beautiful
woman at the ball Jareth smiles down at her and the attraction

between them is palpable

JARETH
You look like a queen

Sarah looks up at him thrilled by his words

SARAH
I I feel like I dont know what I
feel
JARETH
(smiling)

Dont you

And he whirls her around dizzyingly so dizzyingly that she swoons
in his arms He catches her before she can fall very far tightening
his grip around her waist

SARAH
Are we are we in a bubble
JARETH
Yes we are A dream bubble where your

dreams can come true

ANOTHER ANGLE

Our Sarah is being jostled by the crowd She stumbles and almost
falls on top of a COUPLE on a bench The WOMAN is sprawled across
the lap of the MAN who wears a mask with a very phallic nose Sarah
backs away from them frightened

ANOTHER ANGLE

Jareth and Sarah dancing She is smiling up at him he has never
looked more handsome There is something more open about him as if
he too is caught up in the moment He nuzzles her hair with his
lips and whispers in her ear

JARETH
(whispering)
My Queen

Then he begins a song A song that tells Sarah he will give her
everything she wants even things she doesnt know she wants A song
that says forget it all all the restrictions all the
powerlessness Forget and stay in the dream
ANOTHER ANGLE

Our Sarah watches mesmerized But every time she tries to get
closer to Jareth and Sarah she in jostled by a lascivious ADMIRER
pushed out of the way by WOMEN laughingly being chased by MEN She
stumbles against a wall and a door opens Inside pillow feathers
are flying and she cant make out what the several people are doing
A WOMAN comes up to the doorway winks at Sarah and closes the
door

ANOTHER ANGLE
Jareth finishes the song and Sarah looks up at him smiling He
moves his face closer to hers and she closes her eyes His face
comes closer and closer
ANOTHER ANGLE
Our Sarah shrinks back from what she is seeing She turns and runs
pushing herself though the languid crowd right into the bubble
itself
EXT BALL — NIGHT
Sarah comes crashing through the bubble and the whole ballroom
crumbles In seconds it resembles nothing so much as a junkyard
EXT JUNK CITY — NIGHT
Sarah runs through the streets of a part-market part-junkyard
There are piles of rubble and junk everywhere and between them are
tents from which people hawk objects of all kinds Some of them
approach Sarah and she pushes them away sobbing
ANOTHER ANGLE
SARAHS POV — A RED TENT
And standing in front of it is an OLD WOMAN stooped over from the
objects piled high on her back She beckons to Sarah and pulls the
tent flap aside
JUNK WOMAN
‘Ere it is Dearie All the fings you want
all the fings you need

ANOTHER ANGLE

The flap opens wider and inside the tent WE CAN SEE Sarahs room
ANOTHER ANGLE

Sarah gasps at the sight and runs headlong into the tent She trips
over the threshold and lands face down on her bed

INT SARAHS ROOM — NIGHT

Sarah sits up on the bed and looks around the room She shakes her
head and laughs

SARAH
What a dream

She gets up and stretches then walks over to the mirror She smiles
at her reflection

SARAH
Yep youve got quite an imagination kid
Just what a great actress needs

She walks over to the bed and picks up Lancelot the bear

SARAH
How about a midnight snack Sir Lance

She goes over to the door and opens it

EXT JUNK CITY — NIGHT
SARAHS POV — THE MARKET JUNKYARD TEEMING WITH ACTIVITY
The JUNK WOMAN peers in
JUNK WOMAN
‘Avent you got everythin you need Dearie
INT SARAHS ROOM — NIGHT
Sarah screams and slams the door She buries her face in the bear

SARAH
It is just a dream

She takes a deep breath and goes to the door again She opens it
very slowly
EXT JUNK CITY — NIGHT
SARAHS POV — THE SAME TEEMING ACTIVITY
The Junk Woman peers in again
JUNK WOMAN
Best to stay in there where its safe

Dearie Dont know what might ‘appen to you

INT SARAHS ROOM — NIGHT
Sarah clams the door again and rushes over to the window A GROUP OF
REVELLERS peer in at her and laugh She quickly pulls the curtains

closed and walks back to the center of the room She stands
clutching the bear then looks up at her reflection in the mirror

ANOTHER ANGLE

Sarahs reflection Herself as a very old woman clutching a teddy
bear

OLD SARAH
Best to stay in here where its safe Dont
know what might happen to you out there
Sarah steps back from the mirror and suddenly the floor becomes a
sea of mud and all the objects in the room come falling down on her
As she tries to rise out of the muck more objects land on and around
her and pull her down
SARAH
Help Somebody help me
EXT JUNK CITY — NIGHT
Ludo and Didymus desperately searching for Sarah Didymus riding his
dog
INT TAVERN TENT — NIGHT

The Bartender holds out his hand greedily Hoggle pulls a treasure
off his belt and slams it on the bar The Bartender pours

EXT JUNK CITY — NIGHT

Didymus and Ludo approach the red tent They spy the Junk Woman

DIDYMUS
Did you see a noble maiden pass this way

JUNK WOMAN
A noble maiden eh What would she be doin
in a place like this

DIDYMUS
Shes on a rescue mission

The Junk Woman finds this hilarious
JUNK WOMAN
A rescue mission ha Youre in the wrong
place for sure The only fings we cares
about rescuin around ‘ere is our worldly
goods

She takes an oil lamp off her back and shines it on her sleeve for
emphasis

INT SARAHS ROOM — NIGHT

Sarah is drowning in a sea of junk She hears Didymus and cries out
hopefully

SARAH
Didymus in here Help me

The door opens and the Junk Woman peers inside

JUNK WOMAN
Dont worry Dearie I sent ‘im away

Sarah groans

JUNK WOMAN
Knew you wouldnt want to be leavin your
nice fings for no rescue mission

SARAH
Oh my god Freddie

JUNK WOMAN
Freddie Is that one of them dolls over

Sarah struggles for the door in the sea of junk

SARAH

No Hes my brother And Ive got to save

She continues pushing through the junk

JUNK WOMAN
No you dont Dearie You can stay right ‘ere
with all your pretty fings

Sarah knows what her choice has to be

SARAH
I know I can
(joyous )
But I dont want to

She lifts herself out of the junk with a mighty heave and stands in
the doorway She looks down at the Junk Woman triumphantly

SARAH
Now get out of my way
EXT JUNK CITY — NIGHT
Sarah runs out of the tent a look of triumph on her face

The Junk Woman pulls something off her own pile and holds it out to
Sarah

JUNK WOMAN
Wait Dearie Look at this

She holds out Sarahs music box opens it and the little Dancer
twirls inside

SARAH
(grinning)
Keep it

And she is off As Sarah goes the CAMERA LINGERS on the Junk Woman
And we begin to move around to her other side and even though we had
just seen her from all sides we now see something very very
different Where the other side of the woman should be WE SEE a
cross-section of her with Jareth inside His head is beneath the
pile of junk and his hand is inside her head making it laugh He is
the puppeteer operating the Junk Lady as indeed she has been
operated Jareth is mad

JARETH
Damn
EXT CASTLE GATE — NIGHT

Ludo and Didymus sit forlornly at the gate Sarah appears out of the
night

DIDYMUS
My lady
Ludo leaps to his feet
LUDO

Sarah rushes into his arms

DIDYMUS

Sarah pulls away from Ludo

SARAH

She leads them through the gates

EXT GOBLIN TOWN — NIGHT

Streets full of hovels encircle the castle This is where the
Goblins live As Sarah Ludo and Hoggle walk through the dark eerie
streets they are met by the slamming of shutters and the
extinguishing of lights

DIDYMUS
Methinks they are expecting us my lady

A CHILD GOBLIN peers at them from an open doorway A FEMALE GOBLIN
sees him and drags him inside and slams the door

SARAH
(grimly)
Methinks youre right
INT TAVERN — NIGHT
Hoggle is still at it He pulls his belt off his body and WE SEE
that the only treasure left is Sarahs plastic circlet He slowly
pulls it off and stares at it The Bartender approaches his eyes

lighting up at the eight of this treasure

BARTENDER
Another

Hoggle hesitates then hands the circlet over The Bartender bites
it and his face lights up with glee

BARTENDER
Plastic

He goes to get the drink and Hoggle puts his face down on the bar
and sobs
ANOTHER ANGLE

At the other end of the bar sits the Wise One The hat looks over at
Hoggle and shakes his head knowingly

HAT
Drinkin to forget eh buddy

Hoggle looks up
WISE ONE
To forget ah yes To suffer a mental lapse
to obliterate from ones consciousness to
suffer amnesia a blank or fugue to drink
the waters of Lethe

HOGGLE
(drunkenly)
Whats Lethe

WISE ONE
The waters of forgetfulness They remove from
our minds what is too painful to remember

Hoggle looks thoughtfully at the drink in his hand

WISE ONE
- but with the memory goes our wisdom or
knowledge that which brings us
understanding also enlightenment

But there is no one to continue benefitting from the Wise Ones
pearls Hoggle is gone

HAT

You can cool it down there hes gone
WISE ONE

The hat sighs and looks over at the Bartender who is still admiring
his plastic treasure

SARAH
Were going to make it

Didymus sniffs the air

DIDYMUS
I am less than sure

They are interrupted by a high-pitched shriek as a GOBLIN jumps on
Ludos back Then the courtyard is filled with Goblins what seems
like the whole army coming right at them Didymus fends off the
vanguard party with his sword and Ludo punches out the ones that get
by him Didymus unswords a GOBLIN and his weapon goes flying Sarah
picks it up and does some parrying of her own But there are too
many of them The threesome turn and run
INT CASTLE — NIGHT

Jareth stands by the window watching the battle The white bird
sits on his shoulder Jareth looks over at Freddie who stands
holding on to the side of the cradle Jareth smiles and turns back
to the melee below The bird flies out the window

EXT GOBLIN TOWN — NIGHT

Sarah Ludo and Didymus race down the streets The Goblins are in
hot pursuit

EXT STREET — NIGHT

They come careening around a corner and it seems that they have
escaped their pursuers The sound of the Goblins seems to be getting
farther away

SARAH
I think we lost them

They turn and see that unfortunately they have come full circle and
are right back in the courtyard Ludo climbs part way up a wall and
looks over the streets

DIDYMUS
What do you see my brother

Ludo gulps What he sees is the Goblin army coming down every street
right towards them

LUDO
Ludo see trouble

And then the trouble arrives and Sarah and Didymus are heavily into
swordplay Ludo tries clumsily to get down and is tormented by
Goblins who prick at him with their spears Sarah looks up and sees
his predicament She gets an idea

SARAH
Call the rocks Ludo Call the rocks

Ludo makes a heroic effort and gets to the top of the wall

He then throws his head back and bellows

EXT GOBLIN TOWN — NIGHT

An enormous rumbling is heard and soon the streets are filled with
boulders all careening towards Ludo They knock Goblins out of
their path like so many bowling pins

EXT COURTYARD — NIGHT

Sarah and Didymus fight bravely Ludo keeps bellowing and throwing
off the occasional Goblin that is stupid enough to jump on him Soon
the rocks reach the courtyard and form a barrier between the
threesome and their attackers Ludo reaches down and lifts Sarah and
Didymus on to the wall They jump and disappear into the castle
enclave

INT CASTLE — NIGHT

A door opens in a dark part of the castle Ludo Sarah and Didymus
enter They look around and quickly tip-toe down a dark corridor
They turn a corner and see some Goblins marching their way They
duck out of sight

EXT CASTLE — NIGHT

The main entrance to the castle TWO GOBLIN GUARDS stand outside the
large wooden doors The results of the threesomes escape can be
heard in the distance A FIGURE staggers out of the dark singing
drunkenly It is Hoggle

HOGGLE
» its so cold in the night with no gold
to keep me warm

He trips over his feet as he approaches the Guard

GUARD
Who goes there

Hoggle so cold oh so cold

GUARD 2
Dont worry about him Hes on Jareths
payroll now

Hoggle falls to the ground then picks himself up
HOGGLE

Thash right Jareth owes me sumthin an
Im here ta collect

They laugh at him then step aside and let him enter

INT CASTLE — NIGHT

A GROUP OF GOBLINS stand in a circle in a corridor They torment a
tiny fuzzy yapping CREATURE with their nipper sticks The creature
gets away from them and goes scurrying down the corridor The
Goblins laugh It turns a corner and starts yapping for all its
worth

ANOTHER ANGLE
Sarah Ludo and Didymus pressed against the wall trying to not be

noticed Unfortunately the little creature has no sympathy for their
plight It stands at their feet making a ruckus
SARAH
(whispering)
Shut up you little monster

Ludo bends down to pet it in the hopes of quieting it

LUDO
Nice thing

But the creature doesnt want a pet It sinks its teeth into Ludos
hand Ludo howls

DIDYMUS
I fear that this means trouble

The Goblins yell and start running down the corridor

SARAH
Run for it

They are off the creature and the Goblins at their heels

INT CORRIDOR — NIGHT

The three are running for all theyre worth Sarah pulls the watch
out of her pocket It is on the 12

SARAH
Only a half hour left Weve got to find
Freddie

ANOTHER ANGLE

Yet ANOTHER GROUP OF GOBLINS running right toward them They stop in
their tracks and start running in the opposite direction

INT INNER COURTYARD — NIGHT

The three come careening into the long narrow inner courtyard
Balconies look down on it from the floor above Opposite them is a
large ornate door They have a lead on the Goblins chasing them but
not for long

ANOTHER ANGLE

On one of the balconies a particularly repulsive little Goblin
laughs sadistically The three look up and see the Goblin with his
hands on a huge lever He pushes it down gleefully and the floor
opens up in front of the threesome It appears to be a bottomless
pit too wide to leap across Horrified they look behind them and
see the Goblins gaining on them And theyre throwing spears
Suddenly there is a triumphant yell from the balcony opposite the
repulsive Goblin and then a FIGURE leaps off it swinging on a rope

SARAH
Hoggle
It certainly is He wrestles with the hideous Goblin and in the
struggle it falls screaming into the pit Hoggle then grabs the
lever and it is not a second too soon The pursuing Goblins are
entering the courtyard

ANOTHER ANGLE

The floor closes and the three run to the door An enraged PURSUER
aims a spear at Hoggle He is hit Sarah screams as Ludo struggles
with the door It wont budge and he begins to smash his body
against it

ANOTHER ANGLE

A seemingly half-dead Hoggle staggers to his feet and throws his
body on the lever He appears to faint from the strain but the
weight of his body pushes the lever and the floor opens again

ANOTHER ANGLE

The enraged Goblins are stopped in their tracks by the yawning pit
They hurl spears at the threesome but it is to no avail Ludo
smashes down the door and they run in

INT JARETHS QUARTERS — NIGHT

Sarah Didymus and Ludo carrying Hoggle enter the room where we
have seen Jareth and Freddie They lock the door behind them No one
is there and Freddies cradle is rocking as if someone had removed
him only moments before Ludo places Hoggle down and Sarah looks
feverishly around the room She spots a door

SARAH
Thats the only way he could have gone

She runs to the door and Ludo and Didymus follow

SARAH
No I have to face him alone

DIDYMUS
But my lady

He is interrupted by the sound of Goblins in pursuit They start
trying to smash down the door Ludo runs to it and presses his body
against it Hoggle moans and Didymus and Sarah run to his side

HOGGLE
I dont expect ya to fergive me Missy
but
She puts her finger to his lips

SARAH
Forgive you for what Saving our lives
HOGGLE
But I betrayed ya I gave ya that damned
peach

SARAH
Ssh You did the only thing you could do

She looks down at his empty belt
SARAH

and I see you lost all your treasures in
the process

HOGGLE
I dont care if I never sees another treasure
again
SARAH
(smiles)

Here Just in case you change your mind

She slips off her mothers ring and presses it into Hoggles hand
He is overwhelmed and Sarah smiles at his pleasure

HOGGLE
And Jareth said ya could never love me

SARAH
Jareth doesnt know everything

She leaps to her feet and Hoggle moans

SARAH
Take care of him Didymus

DIDYMUS
Ill guard the valiant Hoggle with my life

The Goblins give the door a particularly loud smash and Ludo presses
against the door even harder

LUDO
Ludo too

She runs to the other door and stops to look back at them
SARAH
No maiden could have wished for nobler

knights

And she is gone

ESCHER ROTUNDA — NIGHT

Sarah enters an overwhelming room with many staircases balconies
and doorways at different heights and at all kinds of strange angles
that obviously have no relation to what we know as gravity Her
knees buckling from vertigo Then she gasps
ANOTHER ANGLE
Jareth is sitting on the wall with all the ease of a fly

JARETH
Ive been expecting you

Sarah stumbles and falls into the room ending up on the ceiling
She tries to adjust to being upside down

SARAH
Wheres Freddie

She has to look down and sideways to see Jareth and it is clearly
grueling

JARETH
Hes right there

And he points to one of the stairways that juts out at a right angle
from the wall Freddie is climbing up the stairs happily but from
Sarahs point of view it looks like he will fall when he gets to the
top

SARAH
(screaming)
Freddie No

Freddie gets to the top but doesnt fall instead he ends up
crawling up the wall Sarah sighs with relief and closes her eyes
This sends her reeling and she ends up in one of the archways She
tries to orient herself but there is no up no down no sideways
And the baby is about to crawl off a balcony Sarah screams and
Jareth laughs He begins a song that tells Sarah she never really
understood what was gain on Nothing is what it appears to be not
even things like up and down

ANOTHER ANGLE

Freddie in the most precarious-looking situation yet at the top of
a staircase He hesitates to crawl down and to lure him Jareth
creates a ball out of thin air and throws it to the baby Of course
it bounces up And all the while his song is taunting Sarah She
turns away from him and looks into the large mirror framed in the
archway She sees endless SarahS And while shes looking the first
reflection runs to the left the reflection behind that to the
right and so on all the way down the line And Sarahs still
standing there She falls backwards and ends up standing on the
floor watching Freddie chase his ball across the ceiling Jareth
dances on the wall now as he is about to finish his song And there
is Freddie on one of the balconies facing out of the rotunda If he
falls off that hell really fall Sarah runs up the opposite wall
and finds that there is sheer space between her and the baby The
only way to reach him is to jump She looks at Jareth who grins at
her then at Freddie who is teetering on the edge As Jareth comes
to the end of the song there is nothing to do but jump She looks at
Jareth and cant repress a grin of her own
SARAH
Like the man said “nothing is what it
appears to be

She jumps

INT JARETHS CHAMBERS — NIGHT

Sarah falls right on to a magnificent huge bed Opposite her Jareth
sits in a chair Freddie wrapped in a blanket is gurgling on his
lap Sarah reaches into her pocket and pulls out the watch It is a
few minutes before 13 Jareth stands up

JARETH
Theres still time

He gestures to a clock on the wall that shows the same time as her
watch He places Freddie into a cradle and comes over to the bed He
looks down at her

JARETH
Besides Im no longer interested in having a
little goblin prince Ive decided Id much
rather have a queen

He looks into her eyes for a moment Sarah doesnt look away
Instead she slowly eases herself off the bed and stands facing him

SARAH
(archly)
A queen Have you chosen anyone I know

She glides by him and walks to the window Jareth chuckles
appreciatively

JARETH
Youve come a long way little girl

Sarah looks out at the labyrinth

SARAH
I certainly have

She turns to face him

JARETH
Yes I can see it in your eyes
(he moves closer to her)
No one else has ever made it this far in the
labyrinth no one else has ever been
worthy

He takes her hand and brings it to his lips She smiles down at him

SARAH
Whats your offer
Jareth stands quickly and looks at her She certainly has come a
long way

JARETH
Why everything youll rule by my side

SARAH
Everything The chance to spend my life
surrounded by repulsive goblins the chance

to torment innocent creatures

JARETH
(shaking his head)
the chance to never have a care in the
world to never have to do anything that you
dont want to do

Sarah looks at him

SARAH
Anything else

JARETH
(smiling)
Why me Of course

Sarah surreptitiously eyes the clock There is about a minute left
She glides away from the window and tries to position herself closer
to Freddie

SARAH
And what if Im not interested

Jareth reacts with surprise for a moment then shakes his head

JARETH
Impossible I know you I know what you
want

SARAH

Well Ive got news for you Jareth
She makes a beeline for the cradle

SARAH
I dont want you

Shes almost at the cradle but Jareth grabs her arm and stops her

SARAH
(shocked enraged)
Why you miserable creep

Jareth has hold of her arms but she breaks away and hauls off and
punches him in the jaw Jareth steps back stunned Sarah scoops up
the screaming Freddie

SARAH
How could you do this to an innocent baby
Jareth stands rubbing his jaw snivelling stunned

JARETH
You hit me

Sarah Freddie in her arms goes right up to him

SARAH
And Id like to do more you you

She is furious and wants to hit him again badly Since she has the
baby in her arms she makes do with kicking him hard in the shin
Jareth howls and grabs his leg

SARAH
I wouldnt want you if you were the last
goblin on earth

The white bird flies through the window and lands on Sarahs
shoulder Jareth puts his hands on his ears

JARETH
Dont say that

But it is too late he starts shrinking

JARETH
Look at me
(whining)
How could you do this to me

Before Sarahs eyes Jareth turns into an undersized ineffective
snivelling little GOBLIN The features are those of a goblin but
still recognizably Jareth

INT CASTLE — NIGHT

Jareths quarters where Didymus tends Hoggle and Ludo still blocks
the door

JARETH (VO)
(whiney scream)
Why does everything have to happen to me

They look at each other and suddenly Ludo realizes that the Goblins
are no longer trying to break down the door The three start to
laugh

HOGGLE
(proudly)
She did it

They cheer
INT JARETHS CHAMBERS — NIGHT
Jareth the bratty little Goblin is throwing a tantrum

JARETH
Nobody ever cares about what I want

The walls and floor shake so from his pounding fists and feet that a
crack opens up right in front of Sarahs feet She looks at the
clock and the minute hand moves to the 13 She looks at Freddie
Theres nothing to do but jump into the void The clock begins to
strike

SARAH
OK Freddie Time to go bye-bye

She jumps

EXT SKY — NIGHT

Sarah and Freddie spinning through the dark starry sky The
striking of the clock continues

ANOTHER ANGLE

CLOSE ON SARAH AND FREDDIE

Sarah pulls him closer lovingly And they go on spinning

INT NURSERY — NIGHT

Sarah is lying face down on the floor She comes to slowly and tries
to sit up Groaning she rubs her head where it bumped on the corner
of the open drawer She tries to focus blinking her eyes

ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAHS POV

Her eyes slowly focus on Freddies crib When she can see she
gasps Freddies not there The side of the crib is down and the

baby is nowhere to be seen

SARAH
Freddie

She leaps to her feet woozily Still rubbing her head she staggers
out into the hallway
INT RAILWAY — NIGHT

Sarah looks down the hallway and suddenly her face breaks out into a
delighted grin
ANOTHER ANGLE

SARAHS POV

Little Freddie is crawling slowly but determinedly into Sarahs
room When he gets to her bed he uses all his strength to pull
himself up on to his feet by holding on to the bedspread Be then
holds his hand out trying to reach something

ANOTHER ANGLE

Sarah makes her way toward her room delight and wonder on her face

INT SARAHS ROOM — NIGHT
Sarah stands in the doorway looking down at Freddie
SARAH
(softly)
Thats quite a journey you took Freddie
Freddie looks up at her and makes a sound He continues straining
and WE SEE that what he is reaching for is Lancelot Sarahs bear
Sarah smiles and lifts Freddie up She sits on the bed Freddie on

her lap and hands him the bear

SARAH
Here Its yours

Freddie takes it happily
SARAH
(smiling)
You earned it
She kisses his head and rocks him gently Then she gazes out the
window at the stars

EXT HOUSE — NIGHT

The light shines from Sarahs window The white bird flutters down
from the starry sky It perches in the tree beside the path

THE END
