DIBBUK BOX

Mandate PicturesGhost House Pictures
DARKNESS
A lush void endless oblivion

Then words mournful and afraid seep from the blackness the
voice of a young girl we’ll soon know by the name of APRIL

APRIL (VO)
If only my brother knew

The darkness forms into something else something tangible

INT COTTAGELIVING ROOM - NIGHT
INSERT TITLE “BELSZEWO POLAND 1942”

The COTTAGE WALLS close in on us Shadows stretch across
rotten wooden floorboards Insects scurry through sparsely
filled cabinets

APRIL (VO)
- where it came from

A YOUNG COUPLE is frantically stuffing their meager
belongings into three tattered suitcases The look on their
faces tells us that SOMETHING TERRIBLE is coming or even
more likely is already in the house

An infant WAILS shrilly in the background but its cries are
ignored

We move past the frantic couple and into a DARK BEDROOM just
beyond them

INT DARK BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

The bedroom is almost pitch black and yet we can make out
a bed in the corner where the silhouette of a SLEEPING
FIGURE lies underneath a threadbare cotton blanket

The figure WHEEZES as it sleeps its body rising and falling
with each gasp All we can discern of it in the darkness are
glimpses of yellowed and withered flesh corrupted limbs

APRIL (0S)
If only he knew what it really
was

The figure AWAKENS shifting beneath the blankets revealing
a sagging female face folds that hang loose like kneaded
clay BLIND EYES wracked by GLAUCOMA peer out from the dark
a discolored tongue writhes over dry lips
We drift over the old woman and towards an object on the
bedside table

THE DIBBUK BOX

Its merely a wooden box simple and elegant theres a small
and narrow drawer at the bottom and two doors with brass
handles Despite its normal appearance it does hold a
certain quiet malevolence

Crawling in the shadow of the box are a thin procession of
ants their glistening black bodies cross the wooden table
and make their way towards the crack between its doors

APRIL (0S) (CONT’D)
he never would have bought it

We’re then SWEPT INTO back into the darkness and out of
existence entirely

INT BEDROOM - MORNING
SUPERIMPOSE TITLE COLUMBIA MISSOURI SEPTEMBER 18 2003

An alarm clock SCREAMS out bringing us into the present
and into the life of APRIL MCREADY the same young woman we
just heard speaking

For now she’s just a shape beneath the covers a shape
that doesn’t really want to move

For all the posters and typical teenage girl paraphernalia
plastered on the walls the place has a temporary quality to
it as if its resident doesn’t really consider it a “home”

The sound of an ARGUMENT spills from somewhere else in the
small apartment The voice’s are middle-aged and bear the
familiar antagonism of a married couple the topic at hand is
obviously financial

April’s hand WHIPS OUT knocking the alarm clock off the
bedside table and to the floor Her blanket falls away
revealing an intensely pretty girl with raven-black hair Her
features are delicate but theres an edge to her a hardness
to her eyes

April stares at a FAMILY PHOTOGRAPH by her bed it shows a
much younger April catching her posing family by surprise
with a high-powered super-soaker

April turns away from the photo affected for some reason
INT KITCHEN - MORNING

April steps into the kitchen wearing a black hooded
sweatshirt and a backpack covered in hand-sewn metalpunk
band patches The married couple bickering in the tiny space
don’t look anything like April’s parents in the picture

Shes adopted

April ignores the argument at hand digs through the
cupboard Doesn’t look like there’s much to eat

INT APARTMENTLIVING ROOM - MORNING

TOBE a wan looking twelve year old boy sits on a tattered
old flower print couch and quietly watches a cartoon He’s
dressed in slightly too-large hand me downs a pair of
reading glasses rest on his thin nose His parent’s argument
can be heard faintly in the background

April sits down beside him

APRIL
Just quit it Tobe

TOBE
Quit what

APRIL
Smiling all the time it’s
annoying

TOBE
(in on joke)
Okay

April playfully knuckles his shoulder

APRIL
Youre the grimmest looking twelve-
year old I know dude

TOBE
I just don’t want to go to school
today it’s like two degrees
outside

April stands up

APRIL
Be right back
Tobe nods glumly April rushes out of the room when she
returns she’s holding a really stylish and cozy looking
snowboarding jacket

APRIL (CONT’D)
Here try this on

Tobe takes the jacket amazed He stands up trying it on for
size

TOBE
This is for me I’ve always wanted
one of these
(whispered)
Did you steal it or something

APRIL
No of course not it was on sale

She adjusts his collar

APRIL (CONTD)
Just try not to break too many
girl’s hearts today
(appraising)
Look at this charmer

Tobe zips it up grinning in spite of himself

INT CLASSIC BLACK FORD MUSTANG - MORNING

Blistering metal cranks from the speakers accompanied by the
palm-against-dash drumming of ROB a muscular bad boy
with tattoo’s crowning his neck and a ragged bomber jacket

April’s staring out the window at the passing apartment
complexes each of them uniformly grey and drab

ROB
I knew kissing that promoter’s ass
would pay off eventually even if
we did have to be the resident band
for his lame-ass club every Monday

APRIL
You’re excited huh

Rob grins at her

ROB
We could sell like a million t-
shirts on this tour Mastodon pulls
a huge crowd
The car comes to a stop at the curb in front of a modest HIGH
SCHOOL campus

April passes Rob a handful of bills he in turn

reaches into his jacket and gives April several plastic
bags each of them rolled tight packed with green marijuana
buds

APRIL
(sniffing bags)
Youre going to need some thicker
bags every time I’m in English
class my teacher scrunches up his
nose and gives everybody this
really confused nostalgic look

April slides them into her jacket pocket

ROB
Be careful out there Trevor
Watkins got busted for selling last
week

April darts forward kissing her boyfriend

APRIL
No worries if I get caught I’1l
just say you put me up to it

ROB
I don’t like the sound of that

APRIL
(affecting innocence)
“Im just a sweet little girl
officer it was all my
boyfriends idea”

ROB
Get out of here

Smirking April backs out of the car

APRIL
Later

April gives her boyfriend a little wave before losing herself
in the herds of high school kids rushing to their respective
classes
INT COLLEGE CLASSROOM - EVENING

A stark black and white image is projected onto a pull-down
white screen a stricken CHILD lies in bed while an oddly
shaped SILHOUETTE looms over him

We hear a voice from a young man we will soon know as PETER
MCREADY

PETER (0S)
Some believe that the Dybbuk is a
being or entity that has escaped
from Gehenna a Hebrew term very
loosely translated from “hell”

There’s a tight CLICKING sound and the image changes we’re
now treated to a horrific illustration of a haggard man
sitting in a rickety wooden chair in a dark empty room

His face twists in anguish as an UNSEEN FIGURE wraps a
WRINKLED ARM around his chest from behind the chair its
elongated fingers grace the man’s face

PETER (0S) (CONTD)
Many Jewish scholars disagree
claiming that the Dybbuk is less of
a damned soul and more of a tragic
figure A lost wandering spirit
(a beat)

Ultimately though most of them
seem to agree that even if their
possession of a human host isn’t a
consciously malicious act

Peter moves halfway into the beam of the projection
highlighting one side of his face and letting the rest of
his features fall off into darkness

PETER (CONT’D)
the consequences for those
unfortunate enough to be possessed
are no less dire

He’s good looking albeit with the typical college kid
physique too much coffee and top ramen

The projection shuts off and the over-head florescent lights
flicker to life illuminating the large COLLEGE CLASS ROOM

Thunderous applause ERUPTS
Peter smiles modestly at his reception then steps aside as

his beaming instructor DR SCHLESSINGER (60s) takes his
place
DR SCHLESSINGER
Thank you for that presentation Mr
Mcready
(checking watch)

Well that’s it for today I hope
the rest of you are all well on
your way to choosing your thesis
subjects

The students rise from their seats in succession and head
towards the exits

Dr Schlessinger regards Peter as he gathers his things
DR SCHLESSINGER (CONT’D)
So do think you’1l get your

hands on it

PETER
I’1l find out tonight

Dr Schlessinger smiles playfully

DR SCHLESSINGER

You’re not worried at all Even
a little

(a beat)
What if there’s something to the
story

Peter’s eyes darken slightly they seem to harbor the kind
of wisdom only gained through suffering

PETER
You know as well as I do that it’s
just a box It’s going to sit on my
desk and hold down paper while I
finish my thesis

He grins again snapping out of the momentary funk
PETER (CONT’D)
Ill be careful though
INT HOUSEPETERS ROOM - NIGHT

Peter sits at a desk and types away Indie rock with female
vocals gathers around him soothing and smooth

The music matches the room a cozy and smart abode Towering
bookshelves brace the walls all filled with rows and rows of
tomes covering the various facets of Cultural Anthropology
with an emphasis on Folklore and Mythology Next to Peters
computer rests an old fashioned type-writer

Peter sits at his desk and stares at an EBAY entry for “THE
DIBBUK BOX” an allegedly haunted wine cabinet

Its the same object we saw earlier Oddly enough seeing it
on a computer screen robs it of some of its mystery

Peter’s screen-name MCREADYONE is listed as the current
highest bidder There are only FIVE MINUTES left in the
auction

Edgy with anticipation Peter drags his cursor over the
picture of the Dibbuk Box and the images doors SWING OPEN
with a hollow wooden CLICK

Beneath the item are a series of USER COMMENTS They range
from misspelled and incoherent to lucid and genuinely
creeped out

CARINE1253 “So what a woodeen box”

DARKCLOWN “Is there a ghost inside”

MARTINCROWES “I wouldn’t buy it the last owner sounds out
of his mind

MRBARETT “There are some things that you just shouldn’t mess
with why invite trouble”

JUNGLPRINCESS “I think it’s neat I want it It would be
cool to really be haunted”

MARCSHELHORSE “Don’t buy this”

Peter shakes his head not taking any of it seriously this
is obviously just a lark

He keeps his finger poised by the RAISE BID button ready to
vanquish any challenger

INT REFINISHING STOREBASEMENT - NIGHT

Sanding and polishing equipment hang from hooks over a
workbench in the dim basement Silhouetted limbs of discarded
chairs and tables jut out from the darkness like the splayed
out bodies of over-turned insects

Tacked onto a wall in a disturbing montage are a series of
crude drawings They depict some vaguely familiar imagery a
sleeping figure lying in bed withered flesh an obscured
face

It’s directly from what we saw in the cottage in Poland

A computer monitor gleams brightly in the gloom casting pale
light on KIRK an emaciated man with a vaguely rotting
look to his skin He’s hunched over the keyboard and just
staring oddly at the screen On the monitor is the same EBAY
page that Peter was looking at

The DIBBUK BOX rests beside him its face turned away from
us

Kirk coughs raggedly then starts picking away at the skin on
his fore-arm its covered in deep gauges that have recently
grown infected

From somewhere behind him there’s a faint shuffling sound as
if a broken limb was being DRAGGED across the concrete floor

Kirk twists around and peers into the darkness
Silence now Whatever was moving towards him has gone still

KIRK
Hello

The unseen THING in the basement begins to WHISPER in a soft
strangled voice

Kirk shivers in the darkness rising from his chair
defensively The whisper then stops abruptly leaving him
alone in the silent basement
KIRK (CONTD)
(feeble)
Please just please stop

INT HOUSEPETERS ROOM - NIGHT

Peter stares at the screen his eyes are glazing over from
the effort

1 minute until end of auction
Suddenly another highest-bidder screen-name replaces his

Peter FREAKS starts rapidly raising his bet

PETER
C’mon

The seconds are counting down it’s dangerously close and
Peter’s bid comes in at the last moment making him the
highest bidder

Peter grins victoriously

PETER (CONTD)
Nice

EXT CITY STREETS - MORNING
SUPERIMPOSE TITLE SEPTEMBER 19 2003

Early morning grey skies seep a light rain that gives the
asphalt a gleaming reflective quality

Kirk wearing a tattered old hooded black jacket lurches
across the sidewalk Hugged tightly to his chest is a package
bound in construction paper practically mummified with duct
tape Its the exact same size as the Dibbuk Box

He pushes past a TEENAGER who curses at him under his
breath then he steps off the sidewalk and onto the black
asphalt

Cars RUSH PAST kicking up splashes of water from the many
puddles but Kirk doesnt pay attention to any of them He’s
completely focused on the modest POST OFFICE on the other
side of the street

A MUSTANG roars past him HONKING LOUDLY just a foot away
from creaming him Kirk pauses in the street for a moment
then continues his odd staggering walk to the other side

INT POST OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The CLERK an elderly man with glasses quietly watches Kirk
as he struggles to find the correct change to pay for
shipping

Kirk then clutches his chest and begins to cough

His sleeve falls back to his elbow revealing the mottled

skin on his arm The Clerk notices the ravaged flesh and
unnerved averts his eyes

EXT POST OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

A relieved looking Kirk steps out of the post office The
building’s glass windows reflect the busy street -- but
Kirks body obscures his own reflection

Suddenly a soft WHISPERING drifts through the air the same
exact sound we heard back in the basement

The sounds of traffic and the rest of the world die
completely leaving nothing but Kirks heartbeat and the odd
feminine whispering

Kirk slowly turns around to face the glass windows the
source of the noise

He gasps at what he sees stumbling backwards instead of
Kirk reflected in the glass is a HAGGARD HUNCHED OVER
FIGURE

Its back faces towards us -- the prominent ridges of the
spine strain through the thin fabric of its rags What we see
of its skin is withered and racked by age

Kirk continues stumbling backwards shaking his head
actually sobbing

Theres a loud CRACKING sound as the figure twists towards
us threatening to expose its face

Kirk closes his eyes shielding himself

When he pulls his hand away the figure is gone leaving only
his own reflection

Kirk shakes his head relieved

IN A DARK BLUR OF MOVEMENT KIRK DISAPPEARS AS A LARGE SUV
SLAMS INTO HIM

The SUV drags Kirks broken and twisted body beneath it as it
goes skidding into the other lane and in the way of oncoming
traffic

A Honda Civic SMASHES into its side PINNING it against two
parked cars

Bystanders scream panicked

A dark red pool spreads out from beneath the SUV then a
bloody arm reaches out and CLAWS at the black asphalt
splitting the nails off its fingers

The clutching hand goes limp

INT HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

A meaty hand reaches out and grabs a plastic bag filled taut
with sticky green marijuana from a second hand this one
slender and feminine

The feminine hand belongs to April who’s looking over her
shoulder on edge The man taking the weed is JOEY a heavily
freckled and paunchy stoner He sniffs the bag

APRIL
Cmon Joey hurry up

Her every breath is visible in the brisk fall air
Joey shakes the bag slightly then reseals it

JOEY
Smells pretty dank

April nods as if to say of course dummy
Joey digs into his pockets

JOEY (CONTD)
Alright twenty-five right

APRIL
Just like the last fifteen times

Joey makes an odd face and steps away from her -- looking
away to some unseen point as if waiting for something to
happen

APRIL (CONTD)
Whats wrong

In the reflection of a car beside Joey two CAMPUS POLICE
OFFICER’S maneuver towards April from behind

April spots them then rushes forward KNEEING JOEY in the
groin and pushes past him entering the labyrinth of parked
cars encircling the high school

JOEY
(pained)
Hey
April yells back at him

APRIL
Narc

The two police officers rapidly brush past Joey on either
side as he moans and cradles his groin

EXT HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

OFFICER JENNINGS tall with an authoritative air moves
between the cars scanning the place for April OFFICER

STEWART female and squat with harsh features trails

behind

OFFICER STEWART
Whered she go Girl shot out like
a rocket then vanished

Officer Jennings leans down crouching low and peers beneath
a parked VAN

He frowns then rises up again -- revealing a frightened
April hiding beneath the VW BUG right behind him

The police officers feet walk right past her and out of
view

OFFICER JENNINGS (0S)
Weve already notified her foster
parents They know the drill

OFFICER STEWART (0S)
Not the first time eh

OFFICER JENNINGS (0S)
Nope Well just stop by there in
an hour -- see if shes

His words trail off as the two police officers walk further
and further away

April frowns waiting a moment then crawls on the asphalt in
the opposite direction ducking behind another car then
rising up into view as she bumps up against an SUV

BOOP BOOP

The vehicles alarm cries out causing a startled April to
high-tail it away from the protesting vehicle and ultimately
out of the parking lot

INT BUS - AFTERNOON

April’s huddled in the back of the bus panicked adrenaline
up She pulls out her cell dials a number

APRIL
Hey Rob I need to stay at your
place tonight
(a beat)
I just got chased by the campus
cops okay I can’t go back home
they called my foster parents

INT BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Rob’s sitting cross-legged in bed smoking a joint while
watching an old black and white horror film His wallpaper is
a disorienting patch-work of scraps of concert flyers

ROB
April you know Id do anything for
you but if you come to my house

you will be leading the cops to a
MUCH LARGER amount of weed

(a beat)
Here just find a place to crash
out for a couple days Then you
could come on tour with us when we
take off

(another beat)
It’s gonna be fine in a month from
now this will all have probably
blown over

INT BUS - AFTERNOON
April sighs considering

ROB (ON PHONE)
Do you have a place that you can go
for just three days

APRIL
(hesitant)
Yeah I think so

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Peters house is a messy but charming college kid dump The
walls are sloppily painted with deep blues and reds and
covered in framed pop art A classic track from THE SPECIALS
plays in the background

Sitting at a dining table and digging into a meal of THAI
FOOD is Peter and his two roommates BECKY a together
looking woman with pale skin and a Betty Page style
haircut and CHRISTOPHER a handsome guy with scruffy
hair and a devilish look in his eyes that betrays how many
drinks hes had during the course of the meal

CHRISTOPHER
You spent three hundred and fifty
bucks

PETER

It’s research
Christopher waves the thought away

CHRISTOPHER
Highway robbery

Two black and white cats creep out from the hallway and take
their places by Beckys chair They curl around the wood
purring hungrily

BECKY
Christopher you probably spend
twice that much a month on
alcohol

Becky reaches down and kneads the scruff of the closer cats
neck

BECKY (CONTD)
Youre in no place to judge

The other cat curls against Beckys other leg and makes a
jealous mrroowwwing sound

BECKY (CONTD)

I know I know I love you too
Vincent

(she smiles at Peter)
Besides I think its a neat idea
for a thesis purchase a real live
“haunted” item and just see
what happens Document it

PETER
Thank you Becky -- but nothing IS
going to happen which is sort of
the point of my thesis

CHRISTOPHER
College just baffles me
sometimes

KNOCK KNOCK

BECKY
Sort of late isnt it

Peter stands up leaving the table and heads towards the
front door He opens it up revealing a very tired looking
April standing on the doorstep

PETER
April

Peter’s instantly on guard his sister’s unexpected arrival
never bodes well April’s looking cagey as well awkward and
at a loss for words

APRIL
Hey

PETER
Is something wrong are you okay

APRIL
Yeah I’m alright

PETER
Here c’mon inside Becky cooked
some dinner

April steps into the house Upon seeing her Christopher
smiles raising a toast to her in salute Becky however looks
more skeptical

CHRISTOPHER
What’s up slick
(a beat)
Haven’t seen you around for a
while a year or something

APRIL
I know how’ve you been

CHRISTOPHER
In debt failing my classes and in
a series of devastating short lived
relationships
(a beat)
Can’t complain

April grins

APRIL
Sounds like fun

EXT LIVING ROOM - LATER

April and Peter sit beside each-other on the couch and play
an old Nintendo one-on-one fighting game Peter’s character
goes sailing to the other side of the screen after a
particularly devastating attack

PETER
(still playing)
So what did you do Blow up a car
Murder somebody Tell me

APRIL
No

PETER
You’re not in trouble Cause if I
recall correctly that’s usually
when you drop by

APRIL
I sort of wanted to take a break
from Karen and Greg they’re at
each-other’s throats recently

PETER
How long of a break

APRIL
Actually I was thinking about
getting legally emancipated

Peter turns away from the screen surprised

April’s character punches his character’s face in and the
figure drops to the floor in a puddle of digital blood Peter
turns back to the screen frowning sets down his controller

PETER
Karen and Greg are trying really
hard April It’s probably just
stressful for them right now She
lost her job he’s holding down
two

She instantly relents shaking her head

APRIL
I was just kidding

PETER
Id hope so And you on your own
No offense but that would be
disastrous

The remark stings her but she hides it well

APRIL

Peter you got a good thing going
here There’s room food I don’t
have to hear people argue all the
time

(a beat)
Is it totally insane that I’d just
want to hang out with my brother in
a nice place for just a couple
days

Peter’s skeptical but despite his concerns he’d never turn
his sister away

PETER
No not insane You’re always
welcome to crash out
(a beat)
Just try not to destroy anything
while you’re here okay

It’s obvious that there’s a tension between them something
unresolved In many ways the low-key banter is a mutual
shield

APRIL
Ill try
(a beat)
Want to play again

PETER
(sleepy )
Have to pass On average I’m
getting about four hours of sleep a
day but I at least try to
maintain that base

He looks like he’d like to give her a hug but doesn’t know
how so instead he pats her shoulder

PETER (CONTD)
Good-night

APRIL
Night

Peter walks out of the living room April reaches out and
switches the video-game screen to the regular television She
turns up the volume allowing the program to wash over her
then closes her eyes

EXT RURAL COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

A lonely country road flanked on both sides by an
impenetrably dark forest Something pale and large moves past
the trees and into view

Its a white DELIVERY TRUCK

The vehicle rocks and shudders as it navigates the bumpy
terrain

INT DELIVERY TRUCK - NIGHT

The cab of the truck vibrates from the effort A HANK
WILLIAMS song spills from the modest speakers

The DRIVER nods his head to the tune rubbing his eyes
struggling to stay awake on the long trek

Dark silhouettes of packages and mail reflect from the rear
mirror Their shadows sway back and forth with each jarring
movement

Theres a sudden BURST OF STATIC on the radio startling the
driver The song returns but the signal comes in weaker this
time

The driver tries to salvage it tweaking the dial

The signal decays further as the ballad drowns in an ominous
white noise

Theres the faintest trace of a FEMALE WHISPERING dripping
unnaturally from the speakers

When the Driver attempts to adjust the dial one of the
SHADOWS expands and SHIFTS in the gloom behind him

The Driver looks up at the rear mirror

The whispering ceases and the ballad resumes without further
interruption

Things are still once more

INT HOUSEKITCHEN - AFTERNOON
SUPERIMPOSE TITLE SEPTEMBER 20 2003

April forages through the kitchen cupboards for food Beckys
spices and herbs take up most of the space

Theres nothing easily edible except for one cereal box with
a post-it that reads Beckys cereal Dont touch it
Christopher

The two cats Vincent and Crispin step into the kitchen and
sit on their haunches quietly watching April

April pulls the cereal box out of the cabinet and sets it on
the counter She opens the fridge one shelf is filled with

every variety of fresh vegetable and juices Each item has a
sticker with BECKYS written on it

APRIL
Wow really

On the second shelf is a crusty old ketchup bottle with a
post-it note on the side that reads Christopher An empty
pepto-bismol container lies on its side next to it

April smirks then grabs Beckys milk and pours herself a
bowl of cereal A brisk KNOCK at the front door causes her to
put it back down onto the counter

INT PETER’S HOUSEPETER’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Peter’s at his desk working when the phone RINGS He picks
it up

PETER (0S)
Hello Yes this is Peter Mcready

INT HOUSELIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

April makes it to the doorway and puts her eye against the
peephole

PETER (0S)
April’s brother yeah I know
youre April’s case-worker right
We met once
(a beat)
She was almost arrested at school
For what

APRILS POV Resting on the doorstep is a lone package A
white delivery truck is slowly making its way down the
street It grows smaller and smaller until it disappears

PETER (0OS) (CONT’D)
No I haven’t seen her She hasn’t
called

April opens the door and steps outside

PETER (0S) (CONTD)
I’ll give you a ring if she does

EXT HOUSESTOOP - CONTINUOUS

April leans down and picks up the package She stares at it
curiously for a moment then steps back inside the house

INT HOUSELIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Peter’s sitting on the couch wearing a look of
disappointment like a familiar sweater

APRIL
(cautious)
Good morning

PETER
I knew there was something you
weren’t telling me just a matter
of time before it got dumped in my
lap

April cops to it immediately no use continuing the charade

APRIL
How did you find out

PETER
I got a call from your case-worker
She said that you were selling
drugs at school Is that true

APRIL
Do you even have to ask me

PETER
I swear to god it’s like a game
show with you

APRIL
Hey

Peter mimics the dramatic tone of a game show host

PETER
“How badly can April screw up”

APRIL
Hey I’m sorry for disrupting
your college kid dream life here
if you want me to leave I will

And there it is the guilt card has been dropped right in
Peter’s lap it’s impossible to ignore Peter stops making
fun of her and just stews for a moment considering

PETER
You know that nobody just handed me
this opportunity April I worked
hard for my scholarship You could
have the same thing you’re
smart it’s not impossible

Peter stops No good use lecturing her she never listens
anyway

PETER (CONT’D)
What are you going to do

APRIL
Rob’s going on tour for a month in
a couple days I’1l go with them

PETER
You want to stay here until then
right

APRIL
Just a couple days and I’1l be
gone

PETER
(resigned)
Yeah you can stay

APRIL
(emphatic)
Thank you

PETER
But while you’re here you’re gonna
do some chores for me and try not
to contribute to whatever bullshit
I already have to deal with on a
daily basis

Peter looks down at the package she’s been holding in her
hands

PETER (CONTD)
What’s this

INT HOUSEPETER’S BEDROOM - EVENING

A curious Christopher and Becky watch as Peter draws a box-
cutter blade across the excessively duct-taped package
slicing through the tape and the card-board He rips open the
top of the package and extracts the wooden cabinet within

CHRISTOPHER
(pseudo-dramatic)
Glad I made it back home in time to
witness the unwrapping of the
cabinet

THE DIBBUK BOX is identical to the picture from the internet
swap meet entry seemingly innocuous merely a wooden wine
cabinet

BECKY
Ooh can I hold it

PETER
(handing it to Becky)
Sure

Becky stares at it for a moment

BECKY
It’s old it smells old at least

Christopher holds out his hands Becky passes it to him

He shakes it slightly eliciting a RATTLING sound from
within

PETER
Don’t do that

CHRISTOPHER
(sheepish)
Sorry

On Peter’s look Becky leads Christopher out of the room

BECKY
We’1ll leave you to it

Peter waits for them to shut the door behind them then
taking a deep breath he focuses his attention back on the
box

He opens the two doors and the bottom drawer SLIDES out along
with them making a loud clicking sound

The cabinet is filled with a variety of strange items Two
US Wheat Pennies from the twenties two small locks of hair
(bound with string) a granite statue engraved and gilded
with Hebrew letters a golden cup a dried rosebud and a
black cast iron candlestick holder with octopus legs

Peter reaches into the cabinet and pulls out one of the locks
of hair

PETER
Weird

He places it back inside the box rubbing his fingers
together distastefully

After giving the other items a good once-over Peter shuts
the door and feeds a fresh piece of paper into his type-
writer

For a moment the room is silent save for the sound of his
typing

With a soft click the Dibbuk Box doors spring open

Peter freezes at the type-writer He slowly turns around to
face the item its contents once more exposed

PETER (CONT’D)
Okay

Peter stands up from the chair then looks down at the item
warily

He then picks it up and stares deeply into it He closes the
doors shut then lifting it up high peers into its base
searching for any trace of an internal mechanism or possible
timer

He places the Dibbuk Box back on the counter and shaking his
head sits back down at the type-writer

Peter COUGHS once then continues typing

We move away from Peter and towards the wooden Dibbuk Box
doors We edge inside the narrow space between them and then
enter the darkness within Everything falls to black
DARKNESS

There’s a soft feminine WHISPERING within the void

INT HOUSEKITCHEN - MID-DAY
SUPERIMPOSE TITLE SEPTEMBER 21 2003

On her knees April scrubs away any dirt from the kitchen’s
tile floor She sprays the corner with some clear
disinfectant then resumes scrubbing with a sponge

Finished she stands up to admire her handiwork where it was
once messy the kitchen is now completely spotless every
tile gleams the counter tops look clean enough to eat off
of the fridge could be brand new

Suddenly April grimaces almost RETCHES

APRIL
What --

She holds her nose and backs out of the kitchen -- BUMPING
into Becky

BECKY
Hey I was going to ask you
something Have you been eating
my

Her face twists up as she smells the stench as well

BECKY (CONTD)
Good god what is that

APRIL
I don’t know I’ve been cleaning
for an hour
(a beat)
It smells like cat piss

Becky frowns knowing where this is leading

BECKY
Vaguely

APRIL
What are you feeding your cats
This doesn’t smell normal
(a beat)
It smells like rotting flesh

BECKY
Vincent and Crispin are perfectly
trained to use the litter box
outside They’ve lived with me in
over three different households and
I’ve never once had a problem

APRIL
Then what the hell is it

Becky shrugs

BECKY
Beats me There’s some heavy duty
cleaning supplies in the basement --
I’m sure just a bit of that will do
the trick

Catty

APRIL
Thanks

INT HOUSEBASEMENT STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

April descends the concrete steps leading into the dark
basement Hanging just above her suspended from a rafter is a
hanging light-bulb April pulls the cord illuminating the
stairs and basement space below with a shallow pool of light

INT HOUSEBASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

Almost every corner of the basement is cluttered with some of
the roommate’s unpacked cardboard boxes and supplies

April inspects a tall bookshelf filled with buckets of paint
tools raid and some cleaning materials She grabs a large
bottle of AJAX off the shelf

THERES A LOUD POP AS THE LIGHTBULB BEHIND HER DIES -- and
the entire basement goes black

April’s silhouette curses in the darkness stumbling
backwards

APRIL
(yelling)
Damn Hey Somebody open the door
I can’t see down here

There is no response from upstairs

April thrusts her arms out in front of her then slowly backs
up against the cabinet to brace herself

Her hand searches the space then wraps around a familiar
shaped object a flashlight

April switches it on and the narrow beam of light cuts right
through the gloom She takes another step -- and there’s a
soft CRACKING sound beneath her foot

APRIL (CONTD)
What

She directs the beam in front of her and the light spills
across the floor

Hundreds of small dark things teem out of the cracks between
the rotten floorboards and shuffle towards her

April moves to the side avoiding the strange dark things and
letting the beam guide her way The flashlight reveals that
the THINGS are a swarm of especially large cockroaches

APRIL (CONT’D)
Gross

She swings the light around and spots movement against the
wall Moving towards it she discovers ANTS GATHERING UP FROM
THE FLOOR CLIMBING ACROSS THE WALL and collecting on the
ceiling

April grabs a bottle of raid from the shelf and SPRAYS at the
dark mass of ants -- and then the cockroaches on the ground

APRIL (CONTD)
Sorry guys

Suddenly she grabs her shoulder and winces --

APRIL (CONTD)
Oww shit

There’s a buzzing sound in the darkness -- as April backs
away from it she finds the beam of light falling across a
small hornet’s nest balanced in the corner of the room

More hornets can be heard moving through the darkness towards
her April turns tail and runs

INT HOUSEBASEMENT STEPS - CONTINUOUS

She charges up the basement steps reaches the door flings
it open then SLAMS it shut behind her

INT HOUSEBECKY’S ROOM - NIGHT

Becky sits at her desk and studies for a medical exam She’s
wearing a long and faded Skinny Puppy t-shirt which barely
conceals her pale and slender legs

The only light in the room is the soft red glow of an antique
lamp resting on the edge of the desk

A large text-book is spread out in front of her She takes
notes in a book positioned in her lap

Exhausted she rubs her eyes
BRRRIINNNG
Her phone rings and she picks it up

BECKY
Hey Still studying Haven’t nailed
it yet No You can’t come over
Andrew Be realistic

Becky sighs leaning back You can tell by her slight lack of
enthusiasm that the interest level in this couple might not
be one-hundred percent equal

BECKY (CONT’D)

You knew what you were signing up
for when you started dating a girl
in Premed

(a beat)
I promise I’1l make it up to you

(another beat)
How Well I got a new pair of
fishnets some handcuffs and a
vintage bottle of wine Hello

The telephone has gone dead
Becky tries the receiver several times -- no dial tone

BECKY (CONT’D)
C’mon

She puts the receiver to her ear and a soft WHISPERING
wafts from it

Creeped out Becky slowly pulls the phone away from her ear

She sets it down on the desk and stares at it Then she
leans down beneath the desk and UNPLUGS the phone

Suddenly her LAMP DIES casting the entire room in darkness

She sits up too fast and bumps her head on the bottom of the
desk

BECKY (CONTD)
(pained)
Ahhh

Becky sits down on the carpet then crawls out from beneath
the desk holding her head

The same WHISPERING SOUND heard from the phone now SEEPS out
from somewhere else in the room

WHISPER (0S)

(faint)

is that you
Becky freezes in place
The room is silent once more
She quickly stands up and opens the door of the room
allowing some of the hallway light to creep inside and
illuminate half of the space The other half remains in

darkness

She steps out of the room and into the hallway

INT HOUSEUPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Becky stares into her room from the hallway She gets down on
her knees and tries to see if she can spot anybody crouching
beneath her bed

It’s hard to tell but there doesn’t seem to be anybody down
there

BECKY
Hello

She then runs back into the room and throws open the closet
doors

Nobody inside -- just racks of dark clothing
BECKY (CONTD)
Losing my mind
(shaking her head)
Too much coffee

She leans against the wall

BECKY (CONT’D)
Need to keep studying need a new
light-bulb

INT HOUSESTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Becky creeps down the stairs of the dark house Every one of
her steps protests with a sharp groan

INT HOUSEDOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Becky stands at the edge of the downstairs hallway The over-
head fluorescent light is on emitting a low buzzing sound
Across from her is the kitchen where the light is on as
well

She enters the hallway and makes her way towards the
kitchen As soon as she reaches the hallway half-point the
fluorescent lighting above her SPASMS violently creating an
odd strobing effect

Behind Becky A HUNCHED OVER FIGURE steps out of the darkness
and into the hallway It can only be seen occasionally and
faintly discerned caught in the spastic illumination

Becky is unaware as she continues towards the kitchen

The HUNCHED OVER FIGURE continues to make its way towards
her it’s merely a dim silhouette its features hidden

It reaches out for her with a GRASPING HAND -- and then the
over-head light dies completely casting both Becky and the
figure into darkness

INT HOUSEKITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

We wait in the kitchen where everything is silent

Becky’s fate is unknown

An unscathed Becky steps out of the darkness of the hallway
and into the kitchen

Apparently nothing happened

Becky reaches the counter beneath the shelves attempts to
pull herself up and onto it

She grabs onto the side of the fridge and pulls herself up
the rest of the way Then she opens one of the cabinets
revealing an unopened case of light-bulbs

Becky smiles and grabs for one -- AND THE KITCHEN LIGHTS GO
OUT

Now balanced precariously on the edge of the counter in the
darkness Becky tries to carefully ease herself to the floor

She makes it down then takes a deep breathe and opens the
refrigerator door

Bright and pale light floods the kitchen ILLUMINATING A
FIGURE STANDING BEHIND HER

Becky turns around -- AND SCREAMS

The figure pushes the fridge door open the rest of the way
and the bright light reveals that it’s only Peter

BECKY
Oh god Peter you scared the hell
out of me

Peter looks away His face is much paler then the last time
we saw him and his cheekbones are now slightly sunken in

PETER
I’m sorry

BECKY
My light upstairs went out and I
heard this sound -- and then all
the lights down here were going
crazy

PETER

Well have an electrician check it
out tomorrow

Peter gives a short cough and holds his chest

BECKY
You okay

Peter nods
PETER
Think I’m coming down with a
cold
Becky lightly touches his cheek

BECKY
Don’t work so hard

Peter slightly eases away from her touch but doesn’t make it
too obvious

PETER
Easier said then done

He reaches into the fridge and grabs a bottle of cold
medicine

BECKY
You know that stuff just knocks out
your immune system What you really
need is vitamins sun and good

food

PETER
This will have to do for tonight
Becky

He trudges out of the kitchen

Becky watches him go with a yearning look it’s obvious that
they may have been closer then just friends in the past

INT KITCHEN - MORNING
SUPERIMPOSE TITLE SEPTEMBER 22 2003

Becky waits in the kitchen in front of the basement door She
checks her watch impatiently The door opens and RONNY an
excessively grizzled electrician steps out

BECKY
So what’s wrong

RONNY
Nothing ma’m

BECKY
What do you mean Everything was
going ape-shit last night
(a beat)
There has to be something

RONNY
The circuit breaker’s fine Every
light in the house works You can
see for yourself

BECKY
Well NOW they do

RONNY
Give me a call if you have any more
problems but I believe that
everything’s in perfect working
order here

Becky eyes him suspiciously

INT HOUSELIVING ROOM - NIGHT

April is fast asleep on the couch curled up tightly beneath
the blankets The only source of light in the dark room comes
from a fringy cable access program playing on the television
It seems to feature some weird sort of middle-aged Latin
dance competition but its impossible to discern

April tosses and turns wrapping the blankets even tighter
around herself -- then with a soft moan she opens her eyes
and sits up straight

Something RUSTLES in the darkness

Groggy but aware of the disturbance April looks around the
room for the source of the sound

A shadowy figure wearing dark rags is curled up at the foot
of the stairs -- hunched in an odd fetal position with its
hands gripping the second step

This is the DYBBUK

April shivers hugging the blanket closer to herself She
tries to get a better glimpse of the figure in the darkness

APRIL
Hello

The Dybbuk quickly straightens up and gripping the edge of
the bannister pulls itself to its feet It stands there
swaying slightly back and forth then sidles up against the
wall

APRIL (CONTD)
Hey

April takes a step off the couch

APRIL (CONTD)
Hey
(building courage)
Whoever you are there’s five of us
in this house

She reaches into her pocket
APRIL (CONTD)
You should go ahead and leave now
because I’m about to call the
police
The Dybbuk is still motionless pressed against the wall

It raggedly LURCHES forward pulling itself up the stairs in
a disturbing crawl and vanishes from view

April cautiously approaches the foot of the stairs

APRIL (CONTD)
Peter Peter wake up

She grips the bannister and stares up at the head of the
stairs There’s no sight of the Dybbuk merely darkness

APRIL (CONTD)
Somebody’s in the house
INT HOUSEPETER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Peter is fast asleep on his bed The Dibbuk Box rests right
beside his face with both doors craning wide open

APRIL (0S)
PETER

Peter’s eyes spring open and he pulls himself off the bed
He cradles his forehead then stumbles towards the door
INT HOUSEUPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Peter staggers out into the darkness of the hallway bracing
himself against the wall

PETER
(yelling)
April what is it
There’s a SCRATCHING sound behind him

The hunched over Dybbuk is pressed tightly against Becky’s
door and raking at the wood with its jagged nails

Peter stays pressed up against the wall not wanting to be
seen

The Dybbuk then reaches for Becky’s doorknob

PETER (CONT’D)
Becky Becky Wake up

INT HOUSEBECKY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Becky sits upright in bed instantly awake Her eyes fix on
the door

RAKE RAKE

The scratching sound is insistent filled with terrible
need

BECKY
(groggy )
What is it
CREEEAAAKKK

Becky’s door slowly swings open and she rears back in her
bed terrified

FRAMED IN HER DOORWAY IS THE DYBBUK it’s merely a silhouette
in the darkness but its very presence is filled with malice

BECKY (CONTD)
Peter help

INT HOUSECHRISTOPHER’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Christophers crouching by his door gripping a baseball bat
wrapped in black duct tape He takes a deep breath kicks the
door open and rushes out into the hallway

INT HOUSEUPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Christopher runs towards Becky’s room where Peter is now
standing by the door He looks inside

Becky is huddled at the foot of her bed shivering

CHRISTOPER
Somebody broke in What’s going on

BECKY
Somebody was standing by my door
maybe he saw Peter coming and went
away I don’t know

CHRISTOPER
Downstairs

Christopher pulls out his cellphone and brings it to his ear

The phone HISSES WITH STATIC Christopher quickly pulls the
phone away unnerved

There’s a CRASHING SOUND from downstairs

PETER
(yelling)
April

Peter rushes to the end of the hallway and to the stairs
with Christopher and Becky behind him

INT HOUSESTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

The three of them head down the stairs with Peter at the
lead

INT HOUSELIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

They make it to the living room where Peter raises a
cautioning hand

The television is overturned shattered in pieces on the
carpet The Dybbuk is pressed against the wall with its back
faced towards them Its bony shoulders rise and fall with
each gasping breath

The three don’t step any further into the living room
Christopher leans closer attempting a better look at the
intruder He fixes on the long grey hair it trails out
behind her like rotting tendrils

CHRISTOPHER
It’s an old woman
(a beat)
Just a skinny old woman
BECKY
(whispered)
Maybe she’s homeless What should
we do
PETER
(whispered)
I don’t know
(a beat)

Where’s my sister

INT HOUSEKITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

April is crouched low behind the kitchen counter with her
legs hugged close to her

She looks up and into the hallway that leads into the living
room
INT HOUSELIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The Dybbuk is still prone motionless against the wall

BECKY
(whispered)
She’s not moving
(a beat)
Wait is she even breathing

AND THE DYBBUK WHIRLS AROUND AND SCREAMS it’s a
bloodcurdling sound filled with anguish and terror

We barely see its face in the darkness just a hint of
ancient yellowed skin features buried in a sea of wrinkles
and folds One thing is clear though it definitely isn’t
human

It lashes out at the air with skeletal hands hosting jagged
nails

Terrified Becky and Christopher both run up the stairs
leaving a paralyzed Peter behind He can’t tear his eyes away
from the Dybbuk Breaking down he falls down to one knee
and covers his face

INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

April hears the terrible cacophony from the living room and
stands up to get a better look

THE DYBBUK MOVES INTO THE KITCHEN

April screams terrified then flings open the basement door
and enters

INT HOUSEBASEMENT STEPS - CONTINUOUS

April races down the basement steps almost tripping in the
darkness

There’s the sound of something rasping and scratching the
walls as it comes up behind her

INT HOUSEBASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

April runs through the basement and reaches a corner of the
room where she slumps down She turns just in time to see the
DYBBUK COME SURGING TOWARDS HER THROUGH THE DARKNESS

She barely has time to scream

DARKNESS

END DREAM SEQUENCE

INT HOUSECOUCH - MORNING

April juts forward bolting upright on the couch Her face
glistens with sweat her eyes are strained

INT HOUSEBECKY’S ROOM — MORNING

Becky lies in a fetal position She presses both of her cats
towards herself in a desperate embrace A single tear
descends her cheek

INT HOUSECHRISTOPHER’S ROOM — MORNING

Christopher sits on the edge of his bed -- his breaths are
rapid his brow is drenched

CHRISTOPHER
God
INT HOUSEPETER’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Peter lies back on his bed perfectly still He quietly
stares at the ceiling Then he sits up looking behind him

Thick clumps of dark hair cling to his sweat dampened pillow

INT HOUSEDINING ROOM - MORNING

There’s an uneasy silence at the dining room table Everyone
quietly eats breakfast except for Peter who is conspicuously
absent

Christopher stares at his bowl of cereal listlessly Nobody
seems to want to speak All of them are lost in thought

April breaks the silence
APRIL
I had the worst dream last night

Christopher and Becky look at her

CHRISTOPHER
Yeah Not sure if it will top
mine but go ahead

APRIL
You guys were all in it and
Peter

Becky frowns unconsciously leaning forward

CHRISTOPHER
Okay

APRIL
Some old woman broke into the
house at least from far away
she looked like an old woman Her
face was different though

Christopher’s mouth literally drops

CHRISTOPHER
Are you serious
APRIL
What
CHRISTOPHER
I mean you really dreamed that
APRIL
Yeah
CHRISTOPHER
So did I

Now the attention is focused on Christopher

CHRISTOPHER (CONTD)
In your dream we all went
downstairs cornered her in the
living room right

April nods surprised Becky’s lost in thought

BECKY
I dreamed the same thing

Holy shit

Christopher’s shaking his head

CHRISTOPHER
(awed )
I didn’t think that was even
possible Pretty amazing don’t you
think

April doesn’t seem too sure

INT HOUSEPETER’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Peter has an intimidating looking stack of homework and
unfinished class assignments piled up on his desk What was
once a neat and cozy work space is gaining an increasingly
cluttered and chaotic quality His trash can overflows next
to several other bags filled taut with garbage A bottle of
WHISKEY is set dangerously close to the computer keyboard

Peter sits at his desk and stares at a blank piece of paper
that’s been fed into his type-writer

The Dibbuk Box lies behind him the doors closed
There’s a KNOCK on his door

PETER
Come in

April steps inside and sits on the bed She instantly picks
up the Dibbuk Box and hoists it into her lap

APRIL
So is this is that thing you got in
the mail that package

Peter nods

PETER
I have to start writing my thesis
on it -- but I’m having trouble
getting going

His tone is uncharacteristically LACONIC

She looks over his shoulder at the printed out ebay article
resting on his desk

APRIL
The Dibbuk Box huh
(a beat)
Spooky

Peter turns to her annoyed

PETER
Here just just set it down
April

APRIL
Okay okay
(a beat)
So I’m taking off Christophers
going to give me a lift to Rob’s
show

Peter is looking away out the window -- where the sun hangs
suspended behind a cluster of houses

APRIL (CONTD)
No speech no lecture Nothing

(a beat)
You’re not going to tell me how
irresponsible I am for just hitting
the road

PETER
(distracted)
No not really

April grins pleased Then she stares at him seriously for a
moment actually taking note of the state of his room the
bottle and his slight physical deterioration

Peter turns around to face her taking her off guard

PETER (CONTD)
What is it

April shakes her head standing up

APRIL
Looks like you threw a party in
here are you okay I mean

PETER
I’m fine

APRIL
You do look sort of sick Maybe you
shouldnt be drinking
(forcing a smile)
I don’t know maybe that box of
yours is actually working

Peter ignores her

PETER
(resigned)

I’m just tired I have tons of work

to do You go have fun on tour
APRIL

Okay right I will Thanks for

having me Peter

April exits

Peter begins to type -- then stops and cradles his temples

INT PETER’S ROOMBATHROOM - LATER

Peter faces himself in the mirror He quickly downs several
pain pills with a murky glass of water He runs his hand
through his hair and several GRAYING strands come of with
it hanging limply from his fingers

INT PETER’S ROOM - LATER

Peter types furiously filling page after page with text
There’s laughter from the room adjacent to his Christopher’s
room It sounds like Christopher and April are in the throes

of an extremely animated discussion

The sound of their voices creeps down the wall until they
seem to be speaking directly beneath Peter

Peter stops typing and stares at the floor
The conversation stops The room goes silent
April’s voice then drips from the ceiling

APRIL (0S)
Is that you

He looks back at the desk The Dibbuk Box has moved from one
side of the typewriter to the other

The doors are now open

Peter reaches out and shuts the doors then picks it up and
places it back on the other side of the type-writer

He resumes his typing then stops The current page in the
type-writer is completely blank

PETER
What

He digs through the pile he’s created flipping past each
page every single one of them a pale canvas free of any
words

Peter throws the pages in the air -- and they go fluttering
down around him like scattered leaves

There’s one page that stays in his lap with a single word
typed on it SARAH The word lies there eerily in the center
of the page

We hear a low wheezing sound from somewhere in the room

Behind Peter there’s now a SHAPE beneath his covers
something is lying in his bed

Peter turns around and the shape twists allowing the
covers to fall away revealing an OLD WOMEN her back faced
towards him

The Old Women stirs then shifts position turning towards
him

Peter turns away just before she turns around completely
based on the wrinkled and corrupted appearance of her back
there’s no telling how unpleasant her face must look

When he looks again the figure is gone His sheets lie flat
on his bed once more

The walls resume their whispering now speaking solely in
Peter’s voice then their quality changes becoming that
of the low female whispering of the HUNCHED OVER FIGURE of
the Dybbuk

PETER (CONT’D)
Oh god

The whispering fills the entire room strangling it
Peter covers his ears tightly

Blood gushes from his nose and splatters onto the white page
in his lap

Peter holds his nose closes his eyes and doubles over in
front of his desk
44

EXT HOUSEBACKYARD - NIGHT

When he opens his eyes he’s sitting cross-legged in the
backyard completely drenched smack dab in the center of a
brutal downpour

The sky is now an abyss of blackness and shifting grey storm
clouds

Apparently he’s been sitting there for hours

PETER
(whispered)
What How did I

He squints up at the dark sky for a moment letting the rain
whip across his face and drip down his hair

Peter tries to stand and collapses falling back to the
grass Another go at it and he’s on his feet Unsteadily he
staggers back towards the house

INT HOUSELIVING ROOM - NIGHT

April has her bag packed and is dressed up to the nines
tight rock band t-shirt red and black plaid skirt and doc-
martins

She’s digging through her backpack for a suitable jacket when
Christopher pokes his head through the front door He checks
her out but tries not to make it obvious Problem is
Christopher is ALWAYS obvious

CHRISTOPHER
Ready to go

APRIL
Almost there just getting a
jacket

CHRISTOPHER
I’1l be outside

April nods quickly and resumes digging She selects her
trusty old hooded sweater then throws it on

When she looks up Peter is standing in the room and looking
at her Water teems from his clothes drenches the carpet
beneath him He looks pale and half crazed

APRIL
(slightly nervous)
Peter what’s going on

PETER
Can I talk to you

APRIL
Could it wait I really need to get
going

Peter ignores her and takes another step forward

PETER
I don’t know what’s happening to
me but I don’t feel like myself

April gives him a strange look uncomprehending Is he
playing a game with her Whatever is going on with him seems
too complicated for her to deal with at the moment

APRIL
I told you that you looked under
the weather -- is that what you
mean

Peter just stares at her blankly almost looking through her

CHRISTOPHER (0S)
Get a move on slacker

APRIL
Listen can we talk about this on
the phone I don’t want to be late
for the show
(a beat)
I gotta go okay Maybe you should
get a check-up or something

April turns around and heads out of the room Peter sullenly
watches her go

INT THE BLACK HOLE TAVERN - NIGHT

Rob’s metal band TEARS their way through a feverish rock set
in the dingy and crowded night club

April is in the heart of the crowd being SLAMMED against by
the throngs of sweat-drenched dancers She watches her
boyfriend’s band but we can tell that she’s not completely
there she feels slightly removed from the action guilty
about leaving her brother when he asked for help

AT THE BAR Christopher’s EDGED out by the unruly crowd and
pressed up against the bar where he awkwardly tries to flirt
with a busty and tattooed BARTENDER She either can’t hear
him over the din or more likely is just choosing not too

CHRISTOPHER
(shouting)
I used to play bass guitar in high
school Never really went anywhere
with it though

The bartender shrugs mouthing “can’t hear you”

BACK IN THE CROWD April’s SHOVED by an especially unruly
ROCKER GIRL and she trips forward almost hits the ground --
but pulls herself up by grabbing another kid’s backpack

She’s done with this madness just needs to be clear of it --
time to make an exit

As she pushes through the violent sea of people for just a
moment Peter’s pale face can be seen staring out at her
from the crowd

His face is exactly the same as it was back in the house
slick from the rain and obviously frightened

APRIL
(whispered)
Peter

She moves towards her brother but he withdraws back into the
crowd disappearing

Aprils panicked trying to shove through people going after
her brother The sea of moshing “comrades in arms” has become
an unforgiving wall

She REACHES Peter grabs his shoulder When he turns
around it isn’t him It’s just some shaggy HIPSTER DUDE He
stares at her inquisitively

HIPSTER DUDE
What

April backs away from him Was she seeing things

ON STAGE The band has ended their set and is starting to
pack up Rob grips the mic one last time

ROB
Thanks everybody for coming
please stick around it just gets
better

He hops off the stage running right into a panicked looking
April

ROB (CONTD)
Hey you

He instantly pulls her into an embrace but she slightly
twists away she’s unnerved

APRIL
I need to go back to Peter’s

ROB
Mastodon hasn’t even played yet
Youre kidding right

APRIL
I think there’s something wrong
with my brother he was acting
really weird tonight

Rob’s hulking bass player TOMMY barrels through the
crowd towards them

TOMMY
Death from above

He lobs a can of Pabst blue ribbon high up in the air it
spirals then plummets towards Rob

He CATCHES IT just barely
Rob cracks it open spilling frothy suds all over his shirt

ROB
Yum what where you saying

APRIL
My brother I think he needs my
help

ROB
You know that we’re leaving tonight
right When did you plan on
“helping” him
A SEXY GROUPIE CHICK with too many piercings and bright blue
hair sidles up beside April wraps her arms around her waist
She whispers in Aprils ear

SEXY GROUPIE CHICK
Your boyfriend’s hot

April shoots her a withering look -- she backs off

APRIL
Can I just catch up with you guys
tomorrow before you leave

Rob shrugs

ROB
Yeah whatever Give me a call
before noon though

AT THE BAR Christopher might have struck out with the
bartender but now he’s talking to a DRUNK GIRL who’s
practically passed out into her pifia colada

CHRISTOPHER
Those fruity drinks will really hit
you hard do you know why
(a beat)
The sugar

April grabs Christopher’s shoulder he shifts through an
invisible wall of jello before focusing his attention on her

CHRISTOPHER (CONTD)
April I was just talking to my new
friend here

APRIL
Could you take me home

CHRISTOPHER
Aren’t you going on tour or
something

APRIL
It’s Peter there’s something
going on with him I can’t just
leave him alone He needs my help

Christopher leans forward affecting a thoughtful pose It
isn’t especially convincing

CHRISTOPHER

Listen anybody who dedicates
himself that much to studying and
homework is already a bit unhinged
He doesn’t need your help he
just needs his space Once you get
to my age you understand those sort
of things

(a beat)
The subtle things

Christopher tries to put his hand on April’s shoulder -- and
spills some of his drink down his shirt the drops of
liquor teem onto the top of his pants darkening the crotch
area

CHRISTOPHER (CONTD)
Damn it

April frowns

APRIL
Give me your keys we’re getting
out of here

INT CHRISTOPHER’S CAR - NIGHT

April navigates Christopher’s crummy Ford through the rain
slick freeway Christopher grooves to the music on the radio
makes occasional attempts to sing along then loses interest

One of Christophers windows isn’t able to close all the way
and some of the water is streaming down the glass and
spraying April

She shakes the excess water off her hand shivers
Christopher takes note grinning sheepishly

CHRISTOPHER
Sorry about that An old girlfriend
of mine slammed the door too hard
once and the window’s never really
been the same

THE REST OF THIS SCENE IS PLAYED OUT ENTIRELY THROUGH APRILS
POV

CHRISTOPHER (CONTD)
I really should fix it but that
would cost money

We momentarily throw a glance at Christopher His eyes dart
from our face to our chest

CHRISTOPHER (CONTD)
Yeah youre really getting
drenched aren’t you

He then looks up sheepishly
CHRISTOPHER (CONT’D)

I’m sorry I’m being a creep I
think I drank too much

We turn our attention back to the rain slicked road

APRIL (0S)
I won’t argue with you there

CHRISTOPHER
That’s good

We then look back at the road
CHRISTOPHER (CONTD)
You know I do have an extra jacket
that you can use It’s in the --

AND OUR VISION GOES COMPLETELY BLACK

APRIL (0S)
Hey I can’t

We hear the sound of the road rushing past and the squeaking
of the windshield wipers but we see nothing

CHRISTOPHER (0S)
April you’re drifting April

Our vision returns

The vehicle’s drifted out of the left lane and dangerously
close to the concrete center divide

APRIL (0S)
Shit

April corrects the car and guides it back

CHRISTOPHER

What the hell was that about I

thought you were the sober one
APRIL (0S)

Everything just went black I

couldn’t see at all
CHRISTOPHER

(annoyed)
Be careful with that

APRIL (0S)
I don’t know what happened but

AND OUR VISION GOES OUT AGAIN

First there’s silence just the sound of the road then

CHRISTOPHER (0S)
Watch it April watch out

APRIL (0S)
Christopher I can’t see

There’s A BLARING HORN and then a terrible wet SKIDDING
sound

APRIL SCREAMS

Our vision cuts back in revealing that the car is FACING THE
WRONG DIRECTION -- TOWARDS INCOMING TRAFFIC

CHRISTOPHER
We’re facing the wrong way

High-beams bear down on us heralding the arrival of a LARGE
SEMI-TRUCK moving far too fast to slow down in time

CHRISTOPHER (CONT’D)
Just back up back up

We put the car in reverse guiding it out of the highway
and onto the shoulder -- JUST AS THE LARGE TRUCK TEARS BY
HONKING THE ENTIRE TIME

APRIL (0S)
I just couldn’t see I just I
don’t know

Christopher grabs her shoulder deadly sober all of a sudden
CHRISTOPHER

April keys NOW
INT PETER’S ROOM - NIGHT
Total darkness just the mere outline of Peter resting
beneath the covers A crack of pale light cuts into the dark
and the door opens
April stands in the doorway peering in checking up on her
brother She waits there for a moment lingering then shuts
the door again letting the room succumb to the blackness
once more

INT HOUSELIVING ROOM - MORNING

April wakes up and finds a note pasted to the foot of the
couch She leans forward to get a better look

It reads “We’ve been getting some calls from the landlord
that your brother hasn’t paid him the rent We’ve already
given him our checks so please remind him Thanx Becky and
Christopher”

INT HOUSEUPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The house is dead silent and has a strange lonely quality to
it We hear FOOTSTEPS as April makes her way up the
staircase and reaches the hallway

Sounds drift from Peter’s room a soft shuffling as if
somebody was raking their heel across the carpet

APRIL
Peter I decided to stay one more
day

April stands in front of his door and knocks twice

APRIL (CONTD)
Peter Are you there

We hear Peter whispering something behind the door low and
unintelligible

APRIL (CONTD)
Can I open up
(a beat)
Your room-mates said you didn’t pay
the landlord

She knocks on the door again then turns the door-knob and
pushes the door inwards

Peter’s room is completely empty

April stares into the room surprised and slightly creeped
out

THERE ARE FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HER

She turns around and spots a FIGURE descending the stairway
It slightly looks like Peter but its hard to tell from this
vantage point

APRIL (CONT’D)
Peter

April hurries to the edge of the steps just in time to see
the back of the figure as it makes a left and disappears
from view at the bottom of the stairway

INT HOUSESTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

April quickly rushes down the stairs

INT HOUSEHALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

April makes it to the hallway and stops The figure is
stepping into the basement door in the kitchen

APRIL
Peter

The figure closes the door behind it

INT HOUSEKITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
April pauses in front of the closed basement door She

reaches forward and opens the door then gazes into the
darkness within

INT HOUSEBASEMENT STEPS - CONTINUOUS
April descends the basement steps

APRIL
Hey

She reaches the bottom

INT HOUSEBASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

April stands in the center of the dark basement seemingly
alone She turns around to leave -- AND RUNS INTO A WAITING
FIGURE

It’s Peter standing in the dark and clutching the Dibbuk
Box close to his chest He stares at April without emotion

APRIL
What the hell Peter I’ve been
looking all over for you

Peter doesn’t respond Just stares right through her

APRIL (CONTD)
You havent paid the rent

PETER
Yeah

April takes him in realizing for the first time how far
gone her brother really is His hair has thinned out
considerably grayed in spots

She looks down at the Dibbuk Box in his arms

APRIL
You were trying to tell me
something before about that box
right

Peter stares down at the box his fingers trace its contours
in the same manner that Kirk’s did

APRIL (CONTD)
You said something about it was
affecting you What did you mean
(a beat)
Here let me hold it for a
second

She reaches for the box AND PETER SHOVES HER SPRAWLING
BACKWARDS

PETER
(yelling)
Don’t touch it

She hits the concrete floor with a pained grunt

APRIL
(shocked)
Peter

His expression takes on a cruel quality there’s something
alien and dark behind his eyes now

PETER
Youre worthless you know that
(a cold beat)
I’m just glad that our parents
aren’t alive to see you now
nothing but a lazy irresponsible
little slut

He coughs raggedly holding his chest Droplets of blood FLY
out and spatter his shirt

April watches in horror then rises to her feet and tries to
tend to him

Peter quickly turns around and staggers up the stairs
leaving April alone in the dark basement

INT HOUSEDINING ROOM - NIGHT

April Becky and Christopher sit at the dining room table
Christopher’s nursing a practically drained bottle of some
“two-buck Chuck” looks vexed and half in the bag Vincent
and Crispin recline at Becky’s feet unaware of the human
drama playing out around them

APRIL
There’s something bad happening
here and I know I’m not the only
one who realizes that

Becky and Christopher stare at her quietly for a moment
Christopher looks particularly shaken from the driving
incident Becky however being the consummate realist is
stoic

APRIL (CONTD)
I lost my sight last night for
no reason I could have killed both
of us

(a beat)
I almost did

BECKY
How much did you have to drink

APRIL
Nothing
CHRISTOPHER
The girl was stone sober Becky -- I

don’t think she was just trying to
scare me either

BECKY
You two are letting your
imagination run wild Sometimes
when I get stressed my mind plays
tricks on me

April presses on ignoring her

APRIL
Electricity’s been screwed up
and it just doesnt feel right in
this house I don’t even know how
to explain it
(a beat)
I’ve heard whispers

CHRISTOPHER
Like that old woman’s voice

April nods Becky tries to keep her composure but that one
has her attention slightly

CHRISTOPHER (CONTD)
Just like from our nightmare
Becky the nightmare all three of
us had

APRIL

It started when Peter got that box

(a beat)
He’s changed too Just in the past
few days he’s completely
different I think maybe we should
get it away from him

(another beat)
Or destroy it

BECKY
You don’t think your sudden arrival
has put undue stress on him that
compacted with all the work he has
to do for school

April gives her a look

APRIL
He’s been able to “put up” with me
before just fine

CHRISTOPER
You can’t put this on April

And at the worst possible moment Peter steps into the dining
room

CHRISTOPHER
Peter has become really weird
recently

Peter stands there and silently watches them It’s as if
Christopher feels his eyes burning into his back -- he turns
around

Spotting Peter he casually lifts his glass towards his lips
acting as if everything is fine and dandy

CHRISTOPHER (CONTD)
(nervous )
Oh Peter hey didn’t see you
there

Christopher’s wine glass SHATTERS

His palm SPREADS OPEN like a flower in bloom gushing blood
dark plasma pools on the wooden table

Christopher HOWLS in pain and hugs his wounded hand to his
chest leaving a red bloody HAND-PRINT on his white t-shirt

Becky rises from her chair and rushes to the hallway leading
towards the kitchen

BECKY
Ill get the first AID kit

Peter appears completely unmoved by the shocking event He
slowly walks over towards the table his eyes are half-lidded
and distracted looking He mutters under his breath

PETER
Let me help

April watches stunned as her brother picks up a rag and
sloppily mops the blood off the table top It collects on the
floor in shallow puddles

PETER (CONTD)
I’1ll clean this up

Christopher shakes the pain off he takes hold of a piece
of glass embedded in his palm then WINCES as he slowly pulls
it out

He then looks down at the pool of blood on the table

Peter’s reflection can be seen in the surface of the blood
but it isn’t him his skin is withered by age completely
DEFORMED

Hideous

Christopher SCREAMS and backs away from the table knocking
over his chair

April rushes towards him

APRIL
Christopher what is it

He just shakes his head and backs away from the table

Becky re-appears holding a first AID kit and notices the
stricken Christopher She rushes towards him

With an unnerving single-minded intent Peter continues
mopping up the blood on the table unaware of anything else
around him He mumbles as he slowly drags the already
drenched rag back and forth across the wooden surface

Christopher aims an accusing finger Peter’s way while Becky
and April try to comfort him

CHRISTOPHER
His face it’s not his face so
old
BECKY
(shouting)

Peter just get out of here for a
second okay

Peter stares at her listlessly then still holding the bloody
rag slowly trudges his way out of the living room and
towards the stairway

EXT HOUSEDRIVE WAY - NIGHT

Christopher frantically places cardboard boxes into the back
seat of his car His Ford is already filled to the brim with
whatever furniture and belongings it can hold He stops for a
moment cradling his now mummified hand

CHRISTOPER
Damn
(a frustrated beat)
Dammnit

Becky sits cross-legged on the concrete drive and quietly
smokes a cigarette April walks out of the house holding a
cardboard box She sets it down and sits beside Becky

APRIL
You know that Peter needs our
help

Christopher turns around

CHRISTOPHER
Help him How the hell am I going
to help him No sorry I never
signed up for this shit and I
wouldn’t even know where to begin

(a beat)
I recommend you get him a
psychologist or maybe a priest
Fuck it I don’t know a witch-
doctor

(MORE)

CHRISTOPHER (CONTD)
(another beat)
Either way it’s out of my realm

APRIL
Christopher please

CHRISTOPHER
No way I’m going to a nice and
normal dorm far away from this
place

Becky turns to April

BECKY
I’m sticking around

For the first time the two share a quick understanding a
mutual concern for Peter Becky breaks the moment standing
up so she can give Christopher a farewell hug

April feels something boring into her looks over her
shoulder and back at the house

A DARK FIGURE frames Peter’s window and stares down at them
It just stands there motionless

April shivers and turns away

INT HOUSEBECKY’S ROOM - LATER

The walls in Christopher’s room are now bare empty of any
decoration

April stares out his window and watches as Christopher’s car
pulls out of the driveway in a dark billowing cloud of
exhaust fumes her expression screams “lucky bastard”

Her phone’s SHRILL ring shatters the silence

APRIL
Hello

EXT GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Rob’s crunched up tight inside of a grocery cart while
cradling a forty-ouncer to his chest A PETER PAN style hat
is propped on his head at a crooked angle Tommy is slowly
pushing the cart across the bumpy black asphalt

ROB
Where the hell are you We waited
like two extra hours before
leaving

Across the lot we can spot the silhouette of the band’s
DRUMMER being pushed in a second shopping cart by the LEAD
GUITARIST

The two carts seem to be set-up for a sort of jousting duel

INT HOUSECHRISTOPHER’S ROOM - NIGHT
April leans against the wall drained by the day’s events

APRIL
I’m still at Peter’s house There’s
something wrong with him Rob
something really wrong

There’s the sound of LAUGHING and then the SCRAPING sound of
wheels protesting against concrete

APRIL (CONTD)
What’s that noise

EXT GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Rob’s now speeding across the lot towards the other shopping
cart his “driver” Tommy is laughing his stoned ass off

Rob takes another swig from the bottle

ROB
Listen we’re gonna be in Saint
Louis all day tomorrow just hop
on a bus and I’1l pick you up at
the greyhound station in the
morning

A SUDDEN RATTLE and Rob drops the phone He doesn’t seem to
really mind though as he steadies himself for the upcoming
COLLISION with the other shopping cart

INT HOUSECHRISTOPHER’S ROOM - NIGHT

April stares at the phone perplexed

APRIL
Rob What the hell

After a moment she just hangs up

There’s a SHUFFLING sound from elsewhere in the room and
Peter shambles into view wearing a black hooded sweatshirt
the hood is flipped up obscuring his face He pauses by the
entrance

APRIL (CONT’D)
Peter

Becky appears behind him all animated and filled with
motherly purpose she’s lugging a garbage bag filled with
empty bottles of beer presumably Peters

BECKY
I’m taking your brother out of the
house for a bit -- I think he could

use the fresh air

Becky rubs Peter’s shoulder sympathetically you can tell
she’s taking some relish in this role

BECKY (CONTD)
(to Peter)
I’1l meet you in the car just
wait for me

Becky watches him go then turns to April

BECKY (CONT’D)
I think I’m gonna run him by the
Doctor’s too Peter needs a check-
up Could have caught a bug or
something

APRIL
That’s not it Becky
(a best)
I’m gonna take that THING he bought
back to whoever sold it to him
just get rid of it

Becky just shakes her head

INT HOUSEPETER’S BEDROOM - LATER

April rummages through the pile of Peter’s Dibbuk thesis
paperwork trying to gleam any information she can

The Dibbuk Box LOOMS behind her silent and motionless

April stares at the ominous drawings from Peter’s class
presentation frowns at the haunting imagery

The printed out EBAY ARTICLE catches her eye draws her in

We DRIFT over April’s shoulder and towards the dark CRACK
separating the two Dibbuk Box doors and fall into an
ABYSS

DARKNESS

April’s voice cuts in through the black as she reads from the
article

APRIL (0S)
All of the events that I am about
to set forth are accurate and may
be verified with the copies of
hospital records and sworn
affidavits that I have included

The darkness shifts changing bringing us to

EXT ESTATE SALE - AFTERNOON

Storm clouds build above casting gloom over a sparsely
attended estate sale curious shoppers congregate in front of
the MIDDLE CLASS home and pick through furniture and trinkets
that is arranged on a lawn

A good looking man steps into view -- and we recognize him
it’s KIRK It’s shocking how healthy the man looks He holds
the Dibbuk Box in his arms stares at it intently

APRIL (0S)
I originally found the item at an
estate sale for an elderly women
who had passed away Apparently it
was a treasured keep-sake of hers
that she’d kept by her bed for many
years

A YOUNG WOMAN watches him holding the object from afar
there’s something very frightened and tense in her eyes

INT ESTATE SALEGARAGE - AFTERNOON
Kirk faces the clearly distraught women in the dark garage

APRIL (0S)
Her daughter actually insisted I
take it before I made an initial
offer even suggesting that I
take it for free

Tears stream down her cheeks

Kirk nods “Yeah okay okay I’1ll take it”

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

We see the remnants of a birthday cake and candles An
ELDERLY WOMAN sits at the head of the table Kirk sits beside
her He presents her with a wrapped gift

APRIL (0S)
I decided to give the cabinet to my
Mother as a birthday gift

The Elderly Woman starts to unwrap the gift -- Kirk gathers
up an armful of filthy dishes and carries them towards the
kitchen

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Kirk washes dishes under the faint florescent light above
Just over his shoulder we have a glimpse into the dining
room

Kirk’s mother isn’t moving she appears slumped forward Kirk
turns to look at her freaks out rushing back into the
dining room

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Shredded wrapping paper scatters the space in front of Kirk’s
mother who is staring intently at the Dibbuk Box No matter
how much Kirk talks to her or tries to get her attention her
face doesn’t change its expression

APRIL (VO)

Her face had no expression but
tears were streaming down her
cheeks

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Were in a quiet hospital room It’s a study in sterility
rendered the color of pale bone Kirk stands over a hospital
bed where his mother lies beneath the covers Half of her
face is disfigured she seems to be drawing or writing
something on a scrap of white paper

APRIL (VO)
Shed suffered a stroke

The woman drops the pencil hands Kirk the scrap of paper

It reads in sketchy letters HATEG1FT

INT KIRK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

WE DRIFT THROUGH THE HALLWAYS AND LIVING ROOM OF KIRK’S
HOUSE every piece of silverware or furniture made of glass
has been SHATTERED The carpet drowns in an ocean of shards

APRIL (VO)
Shortly after I brought the box
back home things got even worse

The trail of devastation leads to the KITCHEN where a
stunned Kirk stands in the dead center -- silverware and
glasses lie in ruins at his feet

INT REFINISHING STOREBASEMENT - NIGHT

We’re back in the dreary refinishing store basement Kirk
lingers by the narrow window peering out at the rear parking
lot outside

A DARK LAYER of dead insects blanket the entire surface of
the window while a brand new swarm slams their bodies
against the wall of their dead brethren

APRIL (VO)
Then the nightmares started

INT REFINISHING STOREBASEMENT - LATER

Kirk lies curled up beneath his covers while a hunched
over FIGURE in the corner of the room shambles through the
darkness towards him its movements erratic and threatening

APRIL (VO)
An awful hag pursues me in my
sleep and now increasingly while
I’m awake

(a beat)
Terrible headaches persist I’m
now starting to have trouble with
my vision

INT REFINISHING STOREBASEMENT - LATER

Kirk is crouched over his computer in the dark he’s now in
the same wretched state that we recognize him from earlier

APRIL (VO)
I would destroy this thing in a
second except I really don’t have
any understanding of what I may or
may not be dealing with

We move past Kirk’s shoulder and towards the GAPING MAW of
the Dibbuk Box

APRIL (VO) (CONT’D)
I am afraid that if I destroy the
cabinet whatever it is that seems
to have come with the cabinet may
just stay here with me I have been
told that there are people that
understand and specifically look
for these sorts of items

We enter it and fall back into the darkness
DARKNESS

APRIL (VO) (CONTD)
If you are one of these people
please please buy this cabinet and
do whatever you do with a thing
like this

EXT REFINISHING EXPERTS - NIGHT

The furniture refinishing store lies on the edge of a run-
down strip mall Most of the shops are closed save for a 24-
hour laundry mat lit up with ugly green fluorescence that
spills out across the mostly bare parking lot Peter’s car
parks and April gets out approaches the store

April reaches the door to the store and finds it boarded
shut There is a FOR SALE sign plastered in front of the
boards

EXT REFINISHING EXPERTSBACK ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
April stalks through the back alley where there is a half-
filled dumpster positioned beneath one of the narrow windows

leading into the place

She pulls herself up onto the dumpster then squeezes inside

INT REFINISHING EXPERTS - CONTINUOUS

The place is filled with furniture covered in a week’s worth
of dust and dead insects April makes her way past them and
towards the back of the store where there is a door leading
into the basement

INT REFINISHING EXPERTSBASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

April opens her cell-phone allowing the faint light from the
display to guide her way revealing that the place is in
complete disarray

There is Hebrew writing and bizarre drawings of a monstrous
hunched over figure sketched onto the walls It vaguely looks
like the hunched over figure from April’s dream

We also notice the many drawings of the SLEEPING FIGURE
There are several articles about the Dibbuk Box stapled
together all of them regarding the misfortunes that befell
the prior owners

Featured prominently amongst the articles is an old black and
white photograph of a YOUNG BOY leaning against an OLDER
WOMAN The boy has a blissful look on his face

April reaches for the photograph and takes it off the wall

A name scrawled on the back of the photograph reads SARAH
HOROWITZ

Next to the photograph is a printout from the Red Cross War
Victim’s Tracing and Information archive a segment from a
photocopied list of names of those that died in Germany
during the war

Sarah’s name is circled in dark ink

April places the photograph into her pocket

There’s a shuffling noise behind her it’s soft and faint
but present Very close

April turns her head towards the source the farthest corner
in the basement

She moves towards it and discovers an old wooden door
against the wall April tries the knob and discovers that it
is unlocked

She opens the door and steps inside

INT REFINISHING EXPERTSBEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

A pitch black bedroom April fumbles for a light-switch but
finds nothing

She flicks open her phone again and a small GREEN light
begins to weakly highlight the space ahead of her April
takes a cautious into the room

Stale air permeates the place There are no windows and
meager decoration A small bed is tucked against the wall
where the outline of a figure can be seen There’s a bedside
table beside it

We’re in the same bedroom from Kirk’s dream

April doesn’t realize this of course Nervous that she’1ll be
caught breaking into somebody’s home she starts to back out
of the room Then she notices something odd and stops

The DIBBUK BOX is resting on the bedside table

APRIL
(whispered)
What

April approaches the dibbuk box and her meager light
illuminates that several ants are crawling across the
surface and onto a plate of rotten food resting beside it

More insects are moving across the floor up the bed and
onto the motionless body of the figure resting on top of it

Ants crawl between the toes of two discolored feet teem
across thin legs barely concealed by a nightgown

April gasps bringing the light up the figure and to the
face It’s Sarah the woman from the photograph

She’s older now with haggard features and mottled skin
A cockroach crawls across her fore-head and her LIDS SPRING

OPEN revealing two pale blind eyes ravaged by glaucoma Her
tongue laps at her dry lips

Then she begins to whisper soft and incoherent at first
then her whispers take focus as the same sounds we heard
earlier

SARAH
(whispering)
Jacob

April starts to back out of the room

SARAH (CONTD)
(whispering)
Jacob is that you

Sarah’s face begins to YELLOW AND ROT her features cave in
on themselves becoming a nightmare of ruined flesh

APRIL
Oh god

Sarah HOWLS in pain and anguish and crawls off the edge of
the bed

April stumbles back then falls to the carpet

Sarah quickly drags herself across the carpet towards her
LASHING out at the air with her filth-encrusted nails

The closer she gets the less she looks like an old woman
and the more she looks like the hunched over figure from
April’s dream THE DYBBUK

Terrified April pulls herself to her feet and makes it out
of the room just before the Dybbuk reaches her

INT REFINISHING EXPERTSBASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

When April turns around the door is gone leaving nothing
but a bare mortar wall She reaches out and touches the wall
then quickly pulls her hand away

INT HOUSEPETER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

April’s crouched low to the ground digging through the piles
and piles of discarded papers and trash which have been
steadily accumulating on Peter’s floor April has a phone to
her ear

APRIL

I’m interested in the property that
used to be Refinishing
Specialists

(a beat)
Is there any way I could contact
the prior owner Just have a couple
questions

A beat then a look on April’s face that tells us what we
already know the previous owner of the box is dead

She quickly hangs up the phone stunned for a moment then
her eyes rest on what she was looking for Peter’s THESIS
ASSIGNMENT PAGE all of DR SCHLESSINGER’S info is printed on
it

Beside it she spots the sole piece of paper with the name in
the center

Sarah

Where it used to be printed the red splotchy letters now
actually look like they’ve been written in dried blood

APRIL (CONTD)
(whispering)
Sarah

She stands up -- SLAMMING INTO PETER

He still has his hood up darkening his features his eyes
have a drugged up far away quality to them They peer at
April blankly or rather peer through her

APRIL (CONTD)
Peter are you okay I didn’t know
you were home yet

Peter just brushes past her and SITS down on the bed

BECKY (0S)

Youre not going to get anything

coherent from him he’s just had

a prescription from Dr Feel-good
(a beat)

Sleepy-time pills

Becky’s stepped into the room as well

APRIL
What did the doctor say

BECKY
Exhaustion dehydration
basically a laundry list of shit
that tells me he hasn’t been taking
care of himself

April gives Peter a little goodbye wave he’s now lying back
on the bed cocooning himself in the thin white sheets

APRIL
Okay rest up I’1ll be back

She starts to head out of the room

BECKY
Where are you going

APRIL
(evasive)
Just need to go on an errand

April exits pretty damn fast

BECKY
(to herself)
With whose car

INT PETER’S CAR - NIGHT

April navigates Peter’s car through the narrow streets of the
college town The Dibbuk Box rests in the passenger seat The
engraved letters on the back are facing her She traces them
with her finger

Her face is fixed with grim determination the terrifying
things she’s learned about the Dibbuk Box have instilled a
real sense of purpose in her

INT COLLEGE CLASSROOM - NIGHT

Students filters out of Mr Schlessinger’s classroom April
pushes through holding the Dibbuk Box The professor is
behind the desk he looks up at her approach

APRIL
Can I talk to you about something
I’m Peter Mcready’s sister

On the teacher’s nod April sets the Dibbuk Box down

DR SCHLESSINGER
Ahh the Dibbuk Box How is Peter
by the way He’s been missed
(reaching for it)
May I

APRIL
Not too well actually

The teacher touches the cabinet -- and COUGHS RAGGEDLY
DR SCHLESSINGER

(covering mouth)
Excuse me
APRIL
(pointing)
What do the Hebrew letters on the
back mean

DR SCHLESSINGER
Sarah

APRIL
(disappointed
That’s all

DR SCHLESSINGER
Just a name

APRIL
Whoever owned this before him
started having problems It sounded
like what Peter was writing about
for his thesis

DR SCHLESSINGER
That’s exactly why he wanted it
layer in a modern take on that old
folklore focused through his own
perspectives and beliefs

APRIL
The previous owner is dead
(a beat)
Peter is starting to experience the
same things he went through before
it happened

Dr Schlessinger COUGHS again shaking his head now
vaguely bothered by the conversation

DR SCHLESSINGER
Every culture has their boogymen --
which tended to serve some social
function For the Jewish people
the dybbuk acted as a sort of
symbol of the individual’s
responsibility to the community
and the past those who have died

(a beat)

But they didn’t really exist back
then and they certainly don’t
now

APRIL
Please just humour me what if
it was real What would you do for
somebody who’s possessed by one

The teacher stares at the box frowning One of his eyes
visibly TWITCHES his cheek TENSES slightly The box seems
to have a subtle negative effect on him

DR SCHLESSINGER
What was your name again

APRIL
April -- please just tell me

Looking at those eyes filled with concern it’s hard to
refuse She’s obviously going through something intense

DR SCHLESSINGER
In the basic mythology the
afflicted would be taken to a Baal
shem That’s a Jewish mystic
(a beat)
They would perform an exorcism on
them

APRIL
An exorcism exorcism

DR SCHLESSINGER
The Jewish style of exorcism is
different No holy water no
chanting A loved one watches over
the possessed while the Ba’al shem
tries to soothe the restless soul
perhaps seek out the root of
whatever has wronged the spirit and
make amends

The teacher peers at the smooth wooden finish on the side of
the item His reflection stares back at him

DR SCHLESSINGER (CONT’D)
Okay I’ve humoured you enough
Please have Peter come in and

Dr Schlessinger’s mouth twists into a frown and stays
cemented that way

APRIL
What is it

The man’s hands are TREMBLING but the rest of him is frozen
in place Concerned April touches his wrist

Dr Schlessinger looks up facing April and the skin on
the left side of his face slowly SLIDES down collecting in
terrible folds by his jowls

Drool pools out of his mouth and his entire body violently
quivers as he experiences a MASSIVE STROKE

EXT COLLEGE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Red and blue ambulance lights flicker violently bleeding
color through the dark parking lot April watches from afar
as paramedics load Dr Schlessinger’s body into the back of
an ambulance

THE BLUE LIGHT casts colored shadow on her face

INT BECKY’S ROOM - NIGHT

Which CARRY OVER as April now hunches in front of Becky’s
computer

April is on the RED CROSS home-page and is scanning the War
Victims Tracing and Information archive searching for Sarah
Horowitz The web-page is currently LOADING

There’s a HARSH ringing sound she looks at her cellphone
The CALLER ID reads ROB

April stares at the phone longingly for a moment then hangs
up When she looks back at the screen the results are
showing

The woman is listed as diseased with only one other
surviving relative JACOB HOROWITZ an elderly man living in
the SUNNY CREST RETIREMENT HOME in downtown St Louis

A HAND touches April STARTLING her
It’s Becky

BECKY
You’ve been stealing your brother’s
car and now you’re going through
my things Gonna have to draw a
line here

APRIL
I’m just trying to help him I’ve
figured out what’s going on Becky

really

BECKY
I obviously can’t make the decision
for Peter to tell you to leave

But I do think it would be the best
thing for him right now

April’s intense driven by her journey her goal

APRIL
He’s possessed by that thing that
woman we all dreamed about If I
don’t do something about it he
could die

Becky looks at April like she’s just sprouted wings and
zipped around the room in circles

APRIL (CONTD)
You know it’s effecting all of us
too

BECKY
Peter just needs some sleep That’s
all he needs and no extra
stress
April stands up heads towards the door

BECKY (CONTD)
April don’t just walk away

APRIL
I have to stop this I think I
found a way

And she’s gone Becky shakes her head

INT PETER’S ROOM - LATER

There’s a CREAK as Peter’s bedroom door opens Becky stands
at the threshold cautious in the silence

BECKY
Peter Just wanted to check on you

She steps into the dark room and walks past his bedroom
mirror

His body lies beneath the sheets rising and falling slowly
in the darkness

Becky approaches the bed notices that the bed sheets are
only half covering him she pulls them up the rest of the
way

BECKY (CONT’D)
This sister of yours she’s the
reason you’re so drained

As she looks down at Peter’s motionless form we watch the
mirror behind them as his REFLECTION rises sitting up in
bed

His physical body doesn’t move

The darkness masks most of the REFLECTION’S features but
even through the gloom they seem to have a yellowed
withered quality

The two dark pits for eyes stare at Becky from the other end
of the room she doesn’t notice

EXT PETER’S CAR - NIGHT

April navigates the car through the freeway A soft rain has
begun to fall prancing droplets obscure her view of the
road

She takes out her cellphone and places a call to Jacob
Horowitz

APRIL
Hi is this Jacob Horowitz

There’s silence on the other line then we hear a low pained
whisper

JACOB HOROWITZ (ON PHONE)
Yes

APRIL
I was wondering if I could talk
with you for a moment

A pause and then

JACOB HOROWITZ (ON PHONE)
I’m busy right now

APRIL
Is there any chance that I could
come over and visit you
(a beat)
I’d really like to ask you a couple
questions about your mother Sarah

A CLICK as the line goes dead

APRIL (CONTD)
Hello

April pulls the phone away from her ear then stares at it
distastefully

EXT SUNNY CREST RETIREMENT HOME - NIGHT

The run-down retirement home rests on the edge of downtown
St Louis and is surrounded by several towering industrial
factories The building is painted a depressing brown its
windows are frosted over by the chilly weather

April’s car pulls into the parking lot and she steps outside
She stuffs the Dibbuk Box into her backpack and approaches
the entrance

INT SUNNY CREST RETIREMENT HOMELOBBY - CONTINUOUS
April steps into the lobby

The musical equivalent of Valium plays faintly in the
background Decades old couches line the walls where an
ELDERLY COUPLE sit and watch an old black and white sitcom on
a television the size of a lunch-box

A long hallway looms behind the front desk where a middle-
aged NURSE argues with a male VISITOR

VISITOR
Listen she’s been leaving me these
weird messages

NURSE
I understand sir

Her expression screams a total lack of understanding

VISITOR
She seems really confused and out
of it Maybe she’s getting the

wrong medication
(MORE)

VISITOR (CONTD)
(a beat)
I need to see her now

NURSE
Unless you make an appointment I
can’t let you visit we have to
verify your identity For security
purposes

VISITOR
I’m her grandson
(a frustrated beat)
Here let me show you some ID we
share the same last name

The visitor digs into his wallet and flips through his
various cards Meanwhile the Nurse’s eyes quickly dart back
down to the cross-word puzzle she was previously working on

April deciding to bypass the bureaucratic process creeps
past the desk and into the hallway

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

April quietly walks through the hallway The doors on either
side of her have rusty brass numbers on them The carpet is a
stained and faded flower-print that doesn’t look like it’s
been vacuumed or washed in ages the wallpaper curls downward
in spots

A door ahead of her opens and a male ORDERLY steps out
pushing a steel cart covered with plates of half eaten food
ahead of him

April hurries up and catches up with the man

APRIL
Excuse me

ORDERLY
Yeah

He still has the door he stepped out of propped open with his
foot giving a view into the room

APRIL
I’m trying to find one of your
resident’s his name is Jacob

Horowitz

The Orderly squints trying to place the name

ORDERLY
(remembering)
Jacob Oh yeah that crotchety
guy that never sleeps

April looks past the Orderly and into the room
An ELDERLY MAN in his boxers sits on the edge of his bed and
stares at the floor His skin hangs loosely from his

scarecrow-like frame

ORDERLY (CONTD)
Third floor three-twelve

The elderly man slowly lifts his head his features are
mostly in shadow but there’s something slightly off about
them the eyes are so deeply sunken they threaten to fall
back into their sockets

April stares her attention drifting to the odd sight

ORDERLY (CONTD)
You get that

Snapping out of it April looks back at the Orderly

APRIL
Yeah yeah thank you

The Orderly then lets the door shut behind him and pushes
his cart down the hallway in the opposite direction

April makes her way to the end of the hallway where she stops
in front of an ancient looking elevator She presses the up
arrow button and waits

The elevator DINGS and the doors open April steps inside

INT SUNNY CREST RETIREMENT HOMEELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Steel walls on either side harsh fluorescence above April
presses the second floor button The elevator shudders as it
rises

There’s a solid THUD as the elevator comes to a stop and
the doors spread open

Standing out in the hallway is a thin OLD WOMAN wearing a
light blue flower print dress She seems to be staring at the
wall with her back faced towards us

April holds the door open

APRIL
Maam

The Old Woman doesn’t respond She just stays there
motionless in the hallway

APRIL (CONTD)
Do you want to come inside the
elevator

The Old Woman softly whispers something unintelligible

APRIL (CONTD)
Okay Guess not

April steps out of the elevator and into the hallway

INT THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The Old Woman still isn’t moving as April steps past her and
begins to make her way down the hallway

Concerned April stops several yards away and looks behind
her

APRIL
Do you need any help or something

The Old Woman turns away from the wall and looks at her

Her features are drowning in ageless flesh leaving nothing
but a mask of folds wrinkles and varicose veins

April staggers backwards horrified AND BUMPS INTO A FIGURE
WAITING BEHIND HER

It’s a tall and lanky OLD MAN wearing a drab brown suit His
face is identical to the old woman’s yellowed drooping
withered skin He has no mouth and two scarred slits for
eyes

Impossibly the Old Man seems to whisper at April the Old
Woman chimes in their soft murmurs drift through the quiet
hallway

OLD MANOLD WOMAN
(whispering)
Jacob

April steps away from them and quickly hurries down the
hallway towards Jacob’s room

As she passes by several other rooms she realizes that all
of the elderly people in the retirement home bear the same
features

Features similar to the Dybbuk

Some of them rise from their beds and trail after her
following closely whispering in the Dybbuk’s voice Others
just stand there motionless

April finds Jacob’s room twists the handle and steps
inside

INT SUNNY CREST RETIREMENT HOMEJACOB’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

When she turns around JACOB (70s) an imposingly grim
looking man waits behind her watches her coldly He appears
like a man who’s never known the comfort of a night’s rest
he’s haggard and obviously sleep deprived

JACOB HOROWITZ
Youre the one who called

It isn’t a question

APRIL
(breathless)
Yes yeah that was me

Jacob takes a step towards her bringing himself
uncomfortably close He may be old and frail but there’s
still something threatening about him

April takes a nervous step backwards
APRIL (CONTD)
I’m sorry for just showing up but
I didn’t have any other choice
JACOB HOROWITZ
I understand You wanted to talk to

me about my mother correct

April nods vigorously

APRIL
Yes I just wanted to ask you a few
questions anything just a

couple minutes of your time

Jacob turns around and walks over to a phone resting by his
bedside He picks it up and begins to dial a number

APRIL (CONTD)
Wait who are you calling

Jacob casually looks over

JACOB HOROWITZ
Just security Why don’t you take a
seat
(a beat)
Theyre relatively prompt even
in a dump like this

APRIL
Please sir hear me out

April sets down her backpack and unzips it She reaches
inside

Jacob pays her no mind his attention is focused on the
phone

JACOB HOROWITZ
Hello can I please speak to
security

April pulls the Dibbuk Box out of the backpack

Jacob then freezes his eyes straining wide After a tense
beat

JACOB HOROWITZ (CONT’D)
No actually I’m sorry It was a
false alarm

He hangs up the phone and promptly takes a seat For a
moment he stares at the box as if it could saunter across the
room and crawl into his lap

JACOB HOROWITZ (CONT’D)
Where did you get that

APRIL
From my brother
(a beat)
Could you tell me where it came
from

Jacob slowly nods then rises to his feet

He approaches April who cowers slightly then she hands
him the box He takes it and sits down on the edge of the
bed He stares at it for a moment then opens the cabinet
doors

JACOB HOROWITZ
This was my mother’s

APRIL
Sarah

Jacob nods

JACOB HOROWITZ
Her father had given it to her when
she was young She never parted
with it

April watches him intently surprised that he’s opening up
Jacob puts the box down

APRIL
So what happened to her

JACOB HOROWITZ

We lived in Belszewo which is a
very small town Poland this was
1942 Reports were coming back that
something very bad was happening in
other parts of the country

(a beat)
Everyone was trying to leave as
fast as possible

Jacob is quiet for a while

BEGIN FLASHBACK

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

We’re in the same stale old bedroom we saw back at the
refinishing store and Kirk’s dream

Sarah lies fast asleep under the covers A younger version of
Jacob stands over her bed and watches her Jacob’s WIFE looms
nearby cradling the tiny infant The packed suitcases are
now gone they’ve obviously finished packing and are ready to
leave

JACOB HOROWITZ (VO)
We had a three week old infant and
Sarahs glaucoma had stricken her
blind she couldn’t walk

Jacobs wife finishes then grabs onto his shoulder He
doesn’t move just continues staring down at his sick mother

JACOB HOROWITZ (VO) (CONTD)
I knew that I had to make a choice
between my child and my mother

Jacobs wife screams at him then rushes out of the room
Jacob stays behind another minute a torn expression on his
face Then he slowly turns around and walks out of the room

APRIL (VO)
You just left her alone

For a moment the room is still then Sarah stirs in bed and
opens her eyes She peers out into the darkness slowly
sitting up

JACOB HOROWITZ (VO)
Yes I’d left her to die

END FLASHBACK

INT SUNNY CREST RETIREMENT HOMEJACOB’S ROOM - NIGHT

Jacob stares at the floor lost in the past now still buried
by it

April considers all of this then realizes something
APRIL
(to herself)
That’s it that’s
Jacob looks up at her
APRIL (CONTD)
This is going to sound insane

but Sarah your mother

JACOB HOROWITZ
What

APRIL
She’s not at rest

Jacob squints as if waking from a dream He shakes his head

APRIL (CONTD)
When my brother bought the box

he he brought her spirit into
his house

(a beat)
Sarah’s possessing him taking

him over killing him

Jacob is staring at her aghast He doesn’t even speak just
listens to this “strange” young woman speak

APRIL (CONTD)
The only way to save him is if her
spirit is settled

(a beat)
You need to come to my house and
see my brother you have to

JACOB HOROWITZ
What is this Some sort of scam

Any trust or amiability has completely taken flight leaving
a suspicious bitter old shell

He rises to his feet

JACOB HOROWITZ (CONT’D)
Get out of here Just leave now

APRIL
I need your help Jacob

JACOB HOROWITZ
You come in here dredge up these
memories and then tell me this
nonsense get out of here before
I call the police

April stands unsteadily and heads out of the room

EXT SUNNY CREST RETIREMENT HOMEPARKING LOT - NIGHT

April leans against the car door sighing in frustration She
doesn’t know which way to turn or what to do next A soft
rain has begun to fall

BRRRRINNNNG

April’s phone calls out shrilly

She silences her phone’s protests puts it to her ear

APRIL
Hello

BECKY (ON PHONE)
April you need to get here
quickly

The reception is poor so April can barely hear what Becky is
saying Her voice drowns in the poor reception

BECKY (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
Peter he’s Peter help
April

There’s a torrent of ABRASIVE static then the connection
dies completely

April stares at the phone dejected and afraid

INT SUNNY CREST RETIREMENT HOMEBARRY’S ROOM - NIGHT

Jacob paces the room he then reaches into his drawer and
pulls out a photograph of Sarah back when she was younger He
sits down on the edge of his bed and stares at it

The face of his mother smiles back at him then a WRINKLED
and yellowed hand comes from the darkness behind him eases
up his arm encircling it with long corrupted fingers

Jacob freezes in place terrified The wrinkled hand then
slowly draws away

Jacob stands up sharply whirling around The bed is empty

When he looks back down at the photograph of his mother her
features have begun to sag gradually wilting and rotting

He drops the photograph darting towards the other side of
the room just as a wheezing whispering sound fills the
space

JACOB
No it can’t be real can’t be
EXT SUNNY CREST RETIREMENT HOMEPARKING LOT - NIGHT
April’s sitting on the asphalt now letting the rain drench
her Then she slowly looks up something crossing her
face filling her eyes with fire She rises to her feet

INT SUNNY CREST RETIREMENT HOMELOBBY - CONTINUOUS

April strides across the lobby paying no attention to the
Nurse who tries to signal her

NURSE
Excuse me miss You can’t
just

But she’s already gone

INT SUNNY CREST RETIREMENT HOMEHALLWAY - NIGHT

April makes her way through the dim hallway of the retirement
home heading towards Jacob’s room She reaches it and
just throws open the door

Jacob is pressed with his back against the wall his features
pale He slowly raises his head at April’s approach

She stands in the doorway looking more determined then weve
ever seen her

APRIL

You know why you’re having trouble
sleeping at night Jacob You know
what I was telling you is true I’m
not going to let my brother die
just because youre afraid of
facing what you did

(a beat)
You started this Jacob together
we can end it

Jacob looks up at her nervous as hell

EXT SUNNY CREST RETIREMENT HOMEPARKING LOT

Dark storm clouds build muster in the sky blocking the moon
and threatening an even more serious downpour Rain batters
Peter’s car from all sides as it eases its way out of parking
lot and onto the main road

EXT PETER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Jacob stands behind April as she unlocks the door and enters

Behind them the rain hammers down punctuated by brilliant
white flashes of lightning They enter the house

INT PETER’S HOUSELIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The living rooms a total abyss darkness reigns Jacob and
April cautiously step inside shutting the door behind them

There’s a CRASH OF THUNDER which rocks the house causing
Jacob to grip April’s wrist

LIGHTNING STRIKES casting brief illumination which reveals
that the living room is crawling with insects

April winces in disgust

APRIL
Becky Peter Is anyone here

As if in response the television suddenly COMES TO LIFE The
noise is disorienting and abrasive nothing but white noise
with a disturbing undertone that faintly sounds like human
whispering

There’s also an odd mewling sound that can be heard seeping
from upstairs At this distance its indistinct but there’s a
violent quality to it

April leans down to mute the volume on the television Jacob
stands by the stairwell

APRIL (CONTD)
Becky

With the cacophony of static gone the only sound is the odd
mewling upstairs and the pattering of rain against the roof
of the house

JACOB
Maybe they’re gone

A bouncing beam of light reaches the bottom of the stairs

followed by a pale figure that wraps its arms around Jacob’s
neck

Jacob yells in surprise pitching forward dragging the
strange figure with him

APRIL
Jacob

April rushes to his aid and pulls the figure off him
revealing Becky

The left side of her cheek has been split open and bleeding
wounds crisscross her fore-head

APRIL (CONTD)
Becky what happened

Becky just sobs shaking her head back and forth She weakly
points upstairs and passes April her flash-light

APRIL (CONTD)
Is Peter up there

Becky doesn’t even respond just continues to sob

JACOB
Ill tend to her

INT PETER’S HOUSESTAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS

April slowly climbs the staircase letting the narrow beam of
the flashlight penetrate the gloom in front of her The
violent mewling and rasping sound grows louder closer

As her beam moves across the head of the stairs it
highlights a silhouetted figure darting just out of view

April stops in her tracks

APRIL
Peter

There is a soft creaking at the head of the stairs and then
the sound of a door closing shut

April frowns then keeps climbing

INT PETER’S HOUSEHALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

April directs her flashlight to the side of the hallway and
gasps

The hallway wallpaper is covered in deep grooves and slashes
Spattered blood stains the wall on either side

She then swings her flashlight over towards the source of the
noise Becky’s cats are locked in a violent frenzy lashing
out at each other with abandon

APRIL
(to herself)
God

Their yowling becomes frenzied and shifts to pained gurgles
as the two animals rip each-other to bloody bits Mercifully
they come to a stop their glistening little bodies resting
on the carpet

April continues down the hallway towards Peter’s door where
the majority of the cat’s violence seems to have been
directed She tries not to look at them as she passes

The door is slightly ajar

APRIL (CONT’D)
Peter

No response April lightly pushes open the door and enters

INT PETER’S HOUSEPETER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The silhouette of Peter’s prone figure can be seen laying on
top of the sheets on his bed

April aims the flashlight at the bed and gasps at Peter’s
appearance

Haggard with yellowed skin and deep sunken eyes he appears
as if he’s recently passed away and has just begun the early
stages of decomposition

April staggers towards him her hand almost creeps over her
eyes She can’t bear to look

APRIL
(breathless)
Peter I’m here now I brought
him the man responsible He’s
going to help you

Overcome by emotion she takes his hands in hers His eyes are
closed his breathing shallow It’s unclear if he’s awake or
not

Peter stirs and slowly looks up at her

APRIL (CONT’D)
Peter

Peter parts his lips slightly into a half smile that seems to
say that he understands her

April smiles overjoyed and then she winces slightly She
looks down

Blood is trickling down her wrists and collecting on the
floor

APRIL (CONTD)
Oh owww Peter

Jagged nails are emerging from her brother’s fingertips and
sinking into her skin

Peter’s smile grows loose on his face unwieldy until we
realize that it isn’t a smile it’s his features going
through some painful hideous change

April’s flashlight flickers and dies plunging the room into
darkness

APRIL (CONT’D)
Peter

In the thickness of the gloom we watch as Peter’s face
continues to change the skin withers further and then rots
spilling out into awful folds and wrinkles of corrupted skin

April tries to violently yank her arms away from his terrible
clutch but she ends up falling backwards AND PULLING THE
DYBBUKPETER THING WITH HER ONTO THE FLOOR

Her backpack falls off her and goes sliding across the
ground

April’s SOBBING wildly The wretched thing lowers its ruined
face towards her it’s nowhere near recognizable as Peter
now It’s mouth opens like a spreading wound and it SCREAMS

April pulls herself out from under the Dybbuk -- AND IT RAKES
ITS CLAWS ACROSS HER BACK SHREDDING HER SHIRT AND SLICING
HER SKIN

The Dybbuk lurches forward closing in on her -- and then the
door to the room opens

Jacob steps into the darkness a confused look on his face
Then terrified by the sight of the Dybbuk he quickly tries
to back outside but the door doesn’t open

Both Jacob and April are sealed inside of the room

JACOB HOROWITZ
April What’s happening

The Dybbuk quickly turns its head to Jacob and grows more
enraged Its features are now more drastically distorted the
yellowed folds sag down hideously

It moves towards him backing him against a corner -- and
then begins to lash out at him with its claws He huddles
into a ball and lets loose a keening howl of pain

April pulls herself to her feet and rushes towards the
thing She tries to pull the Dibbuk off of him but it swipes
her away

She smashes into the closet doors crumpling one of them
Coming to she unzips her backpack and takes out the Dibbuk
Box

APRIL
Hey Sarah

The Dybbuk gives her a sideways glance then freezes

It fixates on the item -- its face seems to flicker in the
darkness and for a moment we see the normal face of Sarah

An injured Jacob recognizes his mother and shocked at first
slowly gains his resolve

JACOB HOROWITZ

(gasping)
I only left you behind because I
was afraid

(gathering himself)
I was afraid of what would happen
to my son if we had stayed He was
only a child There was no way we
would have been able to take you
with us

The Dybbuk HOWLS then takes hold of Jacob’s neck and its
claws dig in deep drenching his clothing with blood He’s
gasping for air

JACOB HOROWITZ (CONT’D)
I’m sorry I left you mother

Everything stops

Jacob’s eyes are closed from the pain he opens them The
Dybbuk’s hand is slowly raking across his leg the nails are
receding into the finger tips the withered skin is
smoothing out

The slowly changing Dybbuk is now in a dark corner of the
room and sitting there motionless cloaked by shadow When
it moves forward again we notice that Peter is in its stead

APRIL
Peter

He still looks like hell but one thing is certain he’s
back He looks up at April and smiles recognizing her

PETER
April

April rushes to him and the two embrace each other tightly
for what seems like the first time in ages

Jacob watches the reunited siblings and smiles weakly it’s
as if years and years of guilt and regret have dropped from
his face

INT PETER’S HOUSEPETER’S BEDROOM - MORNING

SUPERIMPOSE TITLE “OCTOBER 12 2003”

Peter’s room is filled with cardboard boxes of packed
belongings There are also several items that have been
separately packed and ready to be shipped out for sale on
EBAY Becky can be seen in the hallway lugging her own boxed
items

April sits at his desk and types away Peter stands behind
her leaning over her shoulder We notice that she’s
currently writing an entry for The Dibbuk Box

She’s taken KIRK’S STORY and added her own addition to it As
she types we hear her voice in the background

APRIL (VO)
These are just some of the events
that befell me my friends and
family shortly after my brother
brought the item into his home

We continue to hear the soft clicking of his typing and her
voice as we leave the scene

EXT HIGHWAY - MORNING

April’s dressed in the requisite community service outfit
and buffing GRAFFITI on the side of the freeway with a group
of other delinquent teens

There’s a loud HONKING April turns around to see Peter
parked on the shoulder grinning at her His smile isn’t
mocking though There’s something new in his eyes now a
sense of respect for his sister who’s actually on the road
to becoming a woman

APRIL (VO)
None of us could have ever imagined
how it would have affected us
changed us

INT CEMETERY - MID-DAY

April and Peter stand beside each-other at a sparsely
attended funeral The head-stone reads Loving Son of Sarah
Horowitz

APRIL (VO)
Jacob passed away in his sleep some
time after everything happened His
nurse told us that in the weeks
before his death he slept more then
he did his entire stay

Brother and sister watch the casket lower into the grave and
lock hands

INT POST OFFICE - MID-DAY

Peter is placing item after item onto the post office
counter The MAIL CLERK dutifully registers each one Peter
stands in front of him and digs through his wallet April
stands behind him She reaches into her pocket and places
some of her own cash onto the counter

APRIL (VO)
I’ve included full disclosure of
what happened and that although to
the best of my belief any evil that
may have once existed in the object
has been put to rest

EXT RURAL COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

A familiar DELIVERY TRUCK makes its way out of the city The
driver focuses on the road ready for the long trip His
radio plays a mournful pop tune from the forties

APRIL (VO)
To be safe I can only say please
as always buyer beware

We move behind him and into the darkness where all the
packages and mail are piled up ready for delivery In the
center of the pile is a tightly wrapped package a package
the exact same size as the Dibbuk Box The song on the radio
distorts ridden with static -- and then we hear a faint
whispering sound
