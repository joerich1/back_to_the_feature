Senor Escobar what do you make of the
rumors that drug money was used to
purchase your seat in congress

PABLO
Show me the candidate who didnt spend
money and Ill show you the same one

The gathered roar with laughter

GUIDO PARRA
Senor Escobar won this seat as an
alternate by running a clean race
There was no drug money involved

A young female reporter DIANA TURBAY mid-20s pushes to
within a few feet of El Doctor His men block her advance

DIANA TURBAY
What of reports that call you the
worlds largest cocaine trafficker
and Colombias foremost mass
murderer

Escobar stares down at her his expression betraying nothing

PABLO
They are the products of those in the
press ranks desperate to make a name
for themselves Ms Turbay
DIANA TURBAY
Youve been listed in Forbes magazine
as one of the fifty wealthiest men in
the world Do you expect us to
believe that that fortune is the
by-product of a bicycle rental
business you started with your
brother

Pablo hoists his son up into his arms in a vague defensive
Parra feels for his cue but Pablo answers himself

gesture

PABLO
Your father and our former President
was implicated by the American
television show 60 Minutes as a drug
trafficker Ms Turbay Do you ask him
these kinds of questions

Turbay ignores the slight and presses her questioning

DIANA TURBAY
Are you worried about the US and
their efforts to have you extradited

PABLO

The blame for the cocaine problem in
America must go somewhere so it comes
to Colombia tome We dont have the
gringos drug problem here and the
coca leaf like the coffee bean has
been part of our culture for thousands
of years

That vest is a symbol of our pledge to
help you bring him to justice

As Lara steps to the podium and is greeted by jeers from the
balcony Representatives look up annoyed only to be

glowered back at by Escobars goons

Pablo just picks at his

nails

Pablo now understands that this is to be an ambush and not an

inauguration Barely contained rage bristles as he rises

LARA

I want to welcome all of our
representatives and distinguished
colleagues back to sessionId like
to begin today on a personal note
There have been criminal accusations
leveled against me and my office
Accusations of accepting illegal
campaign checks and ill-gotten gain
from the drug trade In response I
offer to resign my post should any
proof of this surface

There is blackmail and extortion being
perpetrated within Colombias
political class but not by me
((beat pointing)
We have here Representative Pablo
Escobar Born in a very poor area
himself very poor and yet through
astute deals in the bicycle rental
business he has amassed a fortune that
includes dozens of mansions learjets
and expensive cars

(now the killshot)
This man mounts charitable
organizations to bribe a needy and
unprotected people while
systematically destroying the very
fabric of Colombian society

storming down the aisle toward the exit

LARA
His presence here is a disgrace to
decent political aspiration and I am
determined to see him expelled from
the New Liberal Party

(beat voice booming)
And I vow to work with those
governments seeking the demise of your
kind Never again will I refuse the
extradition of one of you dogs

Laras words ring out like a rifle shot Pablo stops at the
chamber doors looking back at the Justice Minister a small
tight smile on his face as he nods exiting

A sudden eruption rises from the balcony An outcry from
Pablos men who begin taunting Lara until theyre forcibly
removed by Security

So Don Pablo ran into some trouble on

A rhetorical that no one responds to As Pablo and his group
are seated General Maza stands and drops his napkin on the

GALAN

You can kill a man and drive the life
from him like my dear friend Rodrigo
Lara What you cannot kill What
will never die is the spirit that
drove the man For it lives on long
after hes left this earth It thrives
in the eyes of our children

GALAN

and in the dreams they carry for our
countrys future A future which is
now under siege The
narco-traffickers think that by
silencing those like Rodrigo Lara
they will win But his death while
bringing us all great sadness will do
nothing to diminish our efforts
against their kind And as
President I will not stop until these
cowards are eradicated one and all

The crowd erupts in applause The young boy has made it to
the front right under the rostrum at the security rope
seeking an autograph from the candidate

Galan grins gesturing for the boy to be brought up As two
of the CNP officers hoist him up his smile evaporates as he
drops the pad and replaces it with a 9mm pistol discharging
it into Galan at point blank range The candidate goes down
behind a miasma of smoke and muzzle flash as the crowd explodes
bedlam breaking and spreading like a brush fire

Jacoby Toft and Santos enter A subdued mood greets them
Assembled are Busby presidential front-runner Gaviria his
slight bookish campaign manager EDUARDO MENDOZA 31 anda
heavily bandaged COLONEL HUGO MARTINEZ still recovering

BUSBY

Gentlemen Im sure were all put off
by the news out of Bogota this morning
But know that as President Barco
prepares to step down-

(beat gesturing)
-Senor Gaviria has agreed at the
urging of the son of the late Luis
Galan to resume his fathers
presidential bidWe all owe hima
huge debt of gratitude for that

A polite round of applause for an embarrassed Gaviria Then

GAVIRIA
My first action will be to work with
our courts and reinstate the
extradition treaty so that the Cali
and Medellin cartels can be
dismantledAnd narcos like Pablo
Escobar can be permanently
imprisoned

The Colonel speaks voice ragged rife with recent loss

COLONEL MARTINEZ
I mean no disrespect to you Senor
But if you attempt to reinstate the
treaty Escobar will resume the
killingAnd hell start with you

BUSBY
The Colonels right Once Pablo finds
out what you intend to do when you take
office youll be targeted

TOFT
(to Gaviria)
You need to get someone close to you
to run your security Someone that you
know would never sell you out

Without hesitating Gaviria turns to his old friend Mendoza

GAVIRIA
Eduardo

Mendoza taken by surprise thinks its a joke at first

MENDOZA
CesarIma lawyer We sell people
out for a living
(off Gavirias look)
Youre serious

GAVIRIA
You are first my friendand the
only person I would trust right now to
ensure the lives of my family

Mendoza weighs that responsibilitythen with reluctance

MENDOZA
Very well

BUSBY
Major Jacoby will provide
surveillance on Escobar so his
movements can be closely monitored
Beyond that our government has
prohibited us from taking military
action or participating any
further
COLONEL MARTINEZ
When Escobar goes back on the rampage
Ambassador And he will When does
the US take up arms with us

Busby doesnt respond The Colonel reads the implication

COLONEL MARTINEZ

Will the US take up arms with us

(off Busbys silence)
We lost thirty officers in the first
five days of Search-Blocs formation
Pablos murdered another ninety-six
since then Its incomprehensible
the damage hes done I had to stop
attending funerals unless those
killed were of rank
(long beat looks up)
I only accepted this assignment
because no one else would I too have
a family and I dont want my wife to
have to bury her husband or my
children their father
(to Gaviria)
But I will see this command through
no matter the cost because I believe
Escobar to be a monsterand
something that must be stopped

The room has gone utterly still The Colonel turns his gaze
to his bandaged hands his words hanging like lead

Papers poke out of a gold-plated toilet One Search-Bloc
officer lifts the lid sees human waste inside recoils from
the stench flushes Hastings the Delta Operator knocks the
officer aside pulling the potentially incriminating papers
out before they disappear down the bowl

He hustles over to the sink and begins washing the documents
off Pablos handwriting and trademark thumbprint appears

Another knock The Colonel puts a finger to his lips edging
his other hand over to retrieve a sawed-off shotgun A beat
another knock followed by a voice

The Colonel slowly unlocks the deadbolt using his foot to ease
the door open A face appears on the other side its General

Tapia carries a duffel bag which he sets down and starts to
unzip The Colonels fingers flex instinctively on the shotgun

two young sons Said this to me

Tapia steps away from the bagstacks of bills begin tumbling
from it bundled by the thousands Adrianna audibly gasps
The Colonel takes a step closer staggered by what he sees

GENERAL TAPIA
Pablo doesnt care that Search-Bloc is
hunting him He just doesnt want you

The Colonel regards his wife awe-struck Here it is A way
out Millions of dollars and the means to live comfortably
without fear for the rest of their lives--

slapping Tapia his superior officer viciously Adrianna is
startled by it Tapia seizes his face guilt consuming
whatever anger has arisen at this slight He then begins to
sob miserably overcomeThe Colonel offers him no comfort

COLONEL MARTINEZ
Pick up the bag and leave here Tell

The Colonel grabs Tapia roughly and physically escorts the
General to the door shoving the duffel bag into his chest

COLONEL MARTINEZ

refuse to remember you this way

GENERAL TAPIA

Why Youre no soldier Hugo Why would

forming)

Pray forgiveness Hold your sons

Tapia humiliated head hung as the Colonel slams the door
WE REMAIN on the Colonel as he leans against the door

the shotgun like a baseball bat shattering the stock against
the wall tears coming too fast to contain He roars enraged

GUIDO PARRA

My client is willing to do whatever is
asked of him Even if it means
submitting to a prison term to bring
about peace

(beat to Gaviria)
But in the spirit of this he requires
from your administration a guarantee
that under no circumstances will he be
placed in the custody of the United
StatesAnd that the current
constitutional ban on extradition
under Colombian law be honored

Pardo tries to contain his contempt Disgusted by the charade

GUSTAVO DE GREIF
Senor President Pablo has also asked
that we refer to this publicly as a
cease fire rather than a surrender

GUIDO PARRA
My client considers himself a son of
Colombia and a revolutionary
fighting for his own personal beliefs

Gaviria has heard enough

GAVIRIA
Does he consider the slaughter of
other innocent Sons of Colombia
as part of some personal belief Can
planting bombs and killing hundreds
of innocent people be considered an
act of revolution

(beat his anger

rising)
Your client deals in drugs and
terrorand if it were up to me Id
have him hunted to the ends of the
earth

Parra hands up a feeble mea culpa

GUIDO PARRA
I am merely the messenger

Gaviria boring in eyes brimming with contempt

No Youre part of what he is and of
what hes wrought on this nation
(beat with malice)
It wont be forgotten

De Greif sensing the growing animosity subtly shifts topics

GUSTAVO DE GREIF
Senor President I know youve
reviewed the proposal Ive submitted
to bring Senor Escobar into custody

Gaviria nods opening a bound booklet taking up a pen

GAVIRIA

With no other choice I must with
grave misgivings and greater
apprehension give it my endorsement

(To Parra)
But if Escobar moves so much as an inch
outside those walls Ill renew our
efforts against him using every single
soldier and every last piece of law
enforcement in the country and he
wont hide behi--

Do you believe other maximum-security
prisoners are permitted such

Pablo wears that familiar quasi-pleasant smile

stepping back to allow Galleano a turn What he sees is small
shed ten miles away in the interior of the city of Medellin

MENDOZA
General I was told an assault was
underway to remove Escobar from this
facility I have orders to transfer
him to a military base back in Bogota

Tapia grimacing shaking his head

TAPIA
I was given different orders Senor I
was instructed to surround the prison
and secure the area

MENDOZA
My orders come from the President

Tapia removes a cigar from his shirt pocket patting himself
down for matches as if he had all the time in the world

TAPIA
This is very confusing
(beat lighting
cigar)
Do you think we should do this tonight
or wait until morning and have a
negotiator sent in

Mendoza can scarcely believe what hes hearing

MENDOZA
General theres no-- Im not here on
behalf of the military soIcant tell
you how to conduct this But by now
Escobar knows were out here and is no
doubt aware of our intentions

Tapia nodding taking a draw off the cigar

TAPIA
I cant make any sense of thisLet
me notify my command

Tapia calls for a field-phone A Corporal rushes one over to
him Mendoza can hear him conferring with his superiors

TAPIA

(talking tough)
Id go in and grab Escobar by the
scruff of the neck and drag him out
here if Iwas orderedto I just dont
have the authorizationand I dont
want to be blamed for what hell do if
we break his agreement

Mendoza fed up yanking off his coat rolling up his sleeves

MENDOZA

Limon circling his intended victims

POPEYE
We should have killed this one during

MENDOZA
(to Pablo)
It would be unconstitutional for us to
send you to the United States

PABLO
You want to take me out of here and have
me killed because I embarrassed the
government Because I have the power
to do for our people what you bastards
could never dream of doing

Popeye leaps at Mendoza spittle flying from his lips

POPEYE

down a dozen barrels He glances over at the two Guardsand
sees that they too are pointing their weapons at him Popeye
thrusts a pump shotgun right into his face racking it

Pablo hangs up handing the phone to Mendoza

PABLO

internal matter Within our group
Why are you getting involved Get

MENDOZA
He wont take the call Theres

Pablo smiles patronizingly

PABLO
Senor MendozaWho do you believe is
really in charge here

And with that Pablo exits the room leaving Mendoza alone with
Popeye who sits down on the bed grinning revealing a briar
patch of badly discolored misshapen teeth

Mendoza remains still Popeye stares Seconds become
unbearable epochs Then commotion flares An outburst of
shouts and confusion followed by staccato gunfire Suddenly
an explosion rips through the bedroom blowing its occupants

blind oxygen cut constricted eyes quickly swelling shut
He then feels strong hands take hold of him and heavy boots
rush in Hes hauled to his feet A VOICE pounds inches away

nothing in his lungs as he runs the voice behind him booming

Were legitimizing relationships
Once we grab Pablo with this group
effort do we honestly think
everybodys gonna resume the Cops and
Robbers routine Itll never happen
We will have permanently mobbed up the

bullet-proofed the cocaine business

bounty to five billion pesos for the
apprehension of the fugitive Pablo
Escobar and I will dedicate myself and
all the might that is at my disposal
to that task He is now our countrys
greatest living enemy

The Colonel continues on through this morass of madness Past
EMTs tending to the mortally wounded Past devastated family
members and fire fighters openly weeping unable to contain
their emotion

SUPER Bogota Colombia October 1993
JUSTICE MINISTER PARDO
Los Pepes is an acronym for Peoples
Persecuted by Pablo Escobar And they
are from what weve been able to
gather a civilian militia of some
kind In a statement issued today
Los Pepes has vowed to quote
retaliate each time Pablo commits a
terrorist act which injures or kills
innocent people

(beat reading on)

Last night in addition to claiming
credit for the death of attorney Guido
Parra The Pepes took responsibility
for the burning of three Escobar owned
businesses and the destruction of a
hangar holding a collection of rare
automobiles

We see projected photos of the Pablo properties torched by Los
Pepes

JUSTICE MINISTER PARDO
(setting brief aside)
We cannot and will not condone this
type of lawlessness and vigilantism
and we demand that this group disband
and cease any further violent action

Pardo is besieged by reporters questions

REPORTER 2
Do you have any idea who is behind Los
Pepes

JUSTICE MINISTER PARDO
Potentially thousands Take your
pick Cartel members hes betrayed
or tried to kill The families of those
hes murdered or kidnapped Escobar
has no shortage of enemies

working out a deal that would return
Pablo to prison Does Los Pepes

call we knew they were our CIs and
wouldnt waste time chasing em

JACOBY

Rodrigo Ospera the cartel member who
went up to Washington and had his meet

excerpt from a sit-down he had at DEA
headquarters a day later

(reading)

The only realistic solution is a
brigade of freedom fighters
controlled by certain individual
interests and independent of
Colombian politicians police or
army There are a great number of
Colombian citizens from all walks of
life who would be willing to assist
support and even finance such an
endeavor

No fuck what it looks like Rip I want

monstrous in what it means--

ROBERTSON
--If Im providing intelligence
thats then being leaked to a
vigilante group so they can go out and
murder Pablos lawyers and aunts and
uncles and fucking parakeets and the
commander of Search-Bloc is
moonlighting for em Then I got a
problem and yeahI think he is And
you know he is Shit man youve
basically been cheering him on--

JACOBY
--Were talking about cold-blooded
murder now--

ROBERTSON
--You had no problem with what Search
Bloc was doing--

JACOBY
--Yeah hunting and killing killers
Give me a fucking break theres a big
distinction in my book between that
and them whacking a bunch of lawyers
