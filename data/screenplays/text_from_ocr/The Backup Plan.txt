foot One bare foot with chipped red polish

ZOE (VO)
I cant believe I didnt get a
pedicure for this How
embarrassing Look at that

The toes open and then curl down as if trying to hide

ZOE (VO) (CONTD)
Whats wrong with me If I were
with a real guy doing this I
wouldve gotten a pedicure And a
wax Im pathetic

The CAMERA PANS to the other foot which is also chipped

ZOE (VO) (CONTD)

the steps by the subway station Its not a big band just a
few guys with an open banjo case and a sign that reads The

Zoe stands there unsure of what to do next Then we hear her
stomach GROWL again Her eyes turn to the stove Something
smells out of this world She tiptoes over and opens the
pot Its beef stew

ZOE (CONTD)
Oh my God

She makes sure the coast is clear and then looks for a spoon
She cant find one She spies a loaf of white bread Grabs

a piece folds it and then scoops up a heaping bite of stew
and devours it
ZOE (CONTD)
(mouth full)
Oh my God

She replaces the lid on the pot And now she just stands
there And stands there some more

ZOE (CONTD)
Oh who am I kidding

She quickly takes two slices of bread and goes back in This
time she uses one piece of bread as a ladle and then the
other to turn it into a sandwich She takes a huge bite

ZOE (CONTD)
Oh My God

Stew dribbles down her chin She takes a third piece of
bread to wipe her face and then takes a bite of that one

Nuts starts to whine and beg Zoe uses her bread-ladle to
toss some stew on the floor for him It lands with plop

And now Joan enters Zoe and Nuts turn their mouths
bursting Joan doesnt quite know what to do All she knows
is shes supposed to be open-minded

JOAN
Would you like a plate

Zoe shakes her head no Wow This is embarrassing

JOAN (CONTD)
A napkin

Zoe nods her head Joan gives her one Zoe holds it over
her mouth as she tries in vain to swallow this inhuman bite

JOAN (CONTD)
Im Joan

Zoe nods Still cant swallow the bite

JOAN (CONTD)
And you must be Zoe

Zoe nods again She tries to shake Joans hand Its the
best she can do Unfortunately her fingers are fluorescent
orange from the Cheetos powder Joan pulls her hand back

INT DINING ROOM - LATER

Stan puts

dollars in vet bills and had to put
him in a wheelchair

EDWARD
You should have sued that place

ZOE
I thought about it but what was

still going to sell inbred dogs
SoI took the money I made when I
left Google and just bought the
place figuring I would do better

STAN
You worked for Google

STAN (CONTD)

take matters into your own hands
Make things happen your own way

Zoe forces a smile If only they knew

EXT LITTLE GOAT FARM - NIGHT

The moon is full and fireflies dot the air as Zoe and Stan
walk the grounds of the farm

important milestone With a little
luck we should be able to see a

LORI

The women are sensing the sarcasm but not getting it

CAROL

TABITHA
Um excuse me What about Luca
Hes been really really sad

ZOE
(floodgates opening)
Have you ever met a guy and you get
butterflies and you think this is
the kind of man who could take care
of me forever The kind of guy who
makes you re-examine everything
Like maybe I can be a stay-at-home
mom and be barefoot and pregnant

The women stare blankly at Zoe

ZOE (CONTD)
He actually lives on a farm Plays
the banjo Maybe I could learn to
sew and take care of the animals
Like Laura Ingalls

Even Dakota stops nursing and looks over at that one

EXT CAROLS APARTMENT - LATER

The women file out No one dares look at Zoe Its very
awkward although Zoe seems unaware She turns to Carol

ZOE

ZOE

down much

CAROL

She just flew to Memphis to watch

her baby being born Seconds after

the birth the birth mother changed

her mind and refused to give it up
Zoes face changes She starts to get it

CAROL (CONTD)

ZOE
Please stop

NANA
Im just saying if he actually

JOAN (CONTD)
All of our friends in New York

Stan nods We get the feeling hes heard this before
JOAN (CONTD)
I guess Im saying that you may
have envisioned your life going one
way but the reality is it could
go a totally different direction
You just have to be open to it

Stan watches a nearby goat coaxing her baby to nurse He
shrugs

STAN
Having a baby with someone I barely
know someone elses babyits

STAN
This whole time weve been apart

Youre really kind of daring How
you quit your job and took over a
pet store all because some asshole
sold you a lame dog You came and
found me at the Farmers Market

INT ZOES LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Zoe sits on the floor of the living room sifting through a
box of photographs

We FOLLOW her back into the bedroom and onto the bed As
Stan slowly opens his eyes she holds up a photograph

His POV Its a picture of a womans ass

ZOE
This is my old ass

Stan blinks a few times His eyes adjusting
STAN
Why do you have a picture of your
ass
ZOE

My college boyfriend took it So
I guess in fairness my ass doesnt
look exactly like this anymore but
its pretty close Its held up

STAN
Its a nice ass

ZOE
You said you dont know the real
me so I thought Id show you

She picks up another photograph This one is of Zoe at
twelve and at her most awkward -- short hair braces and
acne

ZOE (CONTD)
This is me in seventh grade

Stan props himself up in one elbow

STAN
Wow

ZOE

I know

STAN
You look like Anthony Michael Hall

ZOE

This period as horrible as it was
made me who I am I think every
person should go through a
hideously ugly phase It builds
character

(then)
It also taught me that I should
never under any circumstances
have short hair and a perm again

She picks up another picture Its Zoe in a bathing cap and
Speedo Shes holding up a yellow ribbon and has her arm
around Nana

ZOE (CONTD)
This is one of my favorites because
look how happy I am I dont even
know what place yellow is but Im
sure its not good

STAN
Fifth place

ZOE
But I still look super happy
right Thats all because of Nana
Whatever I did she thought it was
the best

The next picture is a Halloween shot of Bobby Mona and Zoe
Bobby is all in green Zoe is all in yellow and Mona is in
regular clothes

ZOE (CONTD)
These are my best friends Bobby
and Mona Mona and I met in high
school and Bobby passed out on my
couch in college and never left
You havent met them yet because
they might scare you away

STAN
Why are you dressed like that

ZOE
Halloween We were supposed to be
a traffic light but Mona bagged out
at the last minute and so Bobby and
I just look like idiots Thats
typical Mona by the way

Zoe puts the picture down and picks up another Its a woman
in a hospital bed Shes giving the thumbs up sign

ZOE (CONTD)
This is my mom

Stan takes the picture and studies it

STAN
You look just like her

ZOE
This is the last picture of her
that I have She lived for a few
more years but we never took any
pictures because she didnt want us
to remember her like that I was
eight when she died

STAN
Icant imagine

ZOE
She had a great laugh And really
soft hands She used to rub my
back before I went to sleep

Zoe puts the picture on the bedside table propping it up
next to her clock

STAN
Do you have any pictures of your
dad

Zoe doesnt say anything

STAN (CONTD)
Im sorry If you dont want to
talk about it

ZOE
My mother was in a coma for two
years before the end Thats when

STAN
Oh

Stan takes her hand

Finally

ZOE

Sothats when he died To us
anyway
STAN
God Zoe Im so sorry
ZOE

(after a beat)
Its okay It was an important
lesson Thats when I realized
that nothing lasts forever

ZOE (CONTD)

real me

STAN
Things can last forever you know

ZOE
Not for me they cant

ZOE (CONTD)
Thats weird

her that it can only be her father

the one of her mother The two pictures side-by-side make
up a family Zoe and her father in one shot and her mother
from the hospital bed giving the thumbs up sign in the other

soundly in a little pink hat

And in the next bed is Nana asleep with a bandage on her
forehead

DISSOLVE TO

And slowly the sound of Stans voice fades out and the sound
of Louis Armstrongs voice fades in

And we watch Zoes face as she realizes that there are some
things that really will last forever

FADE TO BLACK
