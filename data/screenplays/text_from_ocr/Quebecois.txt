From the day Canadian crime became organized the perres
(mobs) ruled Montreal and Montreal ruled Canada

Emigrating from Marseliles ‘and Corsica in the early 1900s
French gangsters soon made Montreal the center for all smug-
gling operations into the United States Im the 20s they

ran whiskey across the Maine and Vermont borders in the 30s
deported Mafiosi in the 40s black market meat and sugar in
the 50s heroin and in the 60s gold bars and coins ‘

In 1952 at the instigation of then New York don Frank Costello
the American underworld began its move into Montreal Seeking
to control the pégres smuggling and gambling operations the
Italian-Americans took over the Italian community on Montreals
South Shore and set up headquarters in the center of the city
Shortly thereafter New York Jewish mobsters starting muscling
in on the West Side clubs and bars

Throughout the next two decades the Americans succeeded in
dismantling incorporating or destroying the French pégres one
by one Thoge which survived were forced to move plock by
block into the-slum-ridden North and East sides of Montreal

This is the story of the final days of the Gaulois Family the
last great French- Canadian pégre of Montreal

Title reads Christmas 1971

‘A light snow had been falling all day on the St- Michel
District and by nightfail a thin sheet of white stretched
across the streets cf northeast Montreal

The cheerless neon lights of the Bouchern Taverne and Le
Marche St-Michel shone through the cold night alr The
last bastions of hospitality a neighborhood bar and ali-
night liquor store A long black Citroen stood in front
of the liquor store

INSIDE THE LIQUOR STORE a large old man wrapped in a
blanket-like black overcoat stood at the counter A

younger man in a black overcoat his BODYGUARD stood
several steps to his left The younger man nervousiy
clasped his thickly-gloved hands together

om

“nw

The STOREKEEPER anxiously waited on the old mans every
breath This was no time to make a mistake he knew
who the old man was

So did everyone else in Montreal -- everyone that is
who ever placed a bet required a quick loan went to
an after-hours club or needed a fix The old man was
BAPTISTE GAULOIS the scion of the Gaulois Family the
last of the kingpins of the French-Canadian underworld

The old man mumbled something and the Storekeeper
hastened to retrieve a bottle of Napoleon Brandy from
the shelf The Bodyguard ill at ease looked nervously
from side to side

Baptiste paid the Storekeeper and picked up the bagged
bottle of brandy The Storekeeper nodding spoke in
hushed tones of great respect

STOREKEEPER “
Merci Monsieur Gaulois Merci
Au revoir

Baptiste nodded and walked toward the door His Body-
guard preceded him

The Bodyguard was already standing on the snowy sidewalk
when Baptistes eye caught the magazine rack He
motioned ahead but it was too late -- the Bodyguard was

- out in the cold

Baptiste picked up the tasteful large format copy of
Elle and carried it back to the counter Dropping a
coin on the counter the old man tucked the magazine
and bottle under his arm and headed toward the door
Approaching the door he braced himself against the

winter night

Baptiste stood OUTSIDE a moment looked toward his black
Citroen and was shuffling toward it when he noticed
something unusual - his young Bodyguard was lying in
the snow beside the Citroen his throat slit from ear to
ear

Baptiste dropped his magazine and bottle (with a MUTED
CRASH) and fumbled inside his bulky overcoat for a gun

But it was too late TWO THUGS dressed in black from
head to toe Jumped from the shadows and began to pummel
him with blackjacks

The old man struggled vainly to protect himself as he
sunk to his knees under the steady barrage of blows
The Thugs paused a moment as if for decency and then
the old mans head thudded against tne snowy sidewalk

The Thugs dragged Baptistes heavy body across the side-
walk into the junk-strewn lot next to the market
Opening his overcoat they went through his pockets
removing whatever valuables they could find

Pocketing Baptistes wallet the first Thug reached
iAnto the shadows and pulled out a gasoline can He
quickly doused the old mans limp body with gasoline

Pausing only a moment for reflection the Thug stepped
back lit a match and tossed it toward the black lumpy
mass Pouf The mass erupted in flames and the Thugs
ran off

There was a pause interrupted only by the SOUND of a
CAR starting up and accelerating away then the burning
heap began miraculously to move Baptiste Gaulois rose
Slowly to his feet

He moved like a pillar of fire through the dark street
struggling step by agonizing step across the sidewalx
and roadway Each step took the tortured giant old man
a step closer to the lights of the Boucherne Taverne

His fiery outline could be SEEN from a block away The
red and yellow flames leaped from his body licking up

the snowflakes before they fell casting flickering and

grotesque shadows across the snow

With a last superhuman effort Baptiste crashed througn
the swinging door of the Boucherne Taverne

INSIDE THE TAVERN a motley crowd cf French-Canadian
drunks and workers bolted back in horrer as they saw
pillar of fire standing before them They were too
shocked to speak the room was frozen still

Baptiste Gaulois his voice croaking with pain screamed

“VIN NAPOLEON ROOM - DAY ot

For the Jast one hundred years the Gaulois Familys

’ lavish mansion had stood atop Mt-Royal overlooking

metropolitan Montreal the docks the St-Lawrenece River
and in the distance the grassy fields of St-Hubert

The Gaulois chateau like rast of Montreals great —

“monuments had been built in the 19th Century in the

style of the 1léth Century Although Montreal had been
a thriving city in the 1760s it was both too poor and
fire-prone to build monuments rivaling those of the
French monarchs So it waited a century

The Napoleon Room appropriately named was decorated in
the style of the Empire Period The massive mahogany
Walls were embellished with elaborate gilt bronzes and
red velvet curtains Gilded eagles sphinxes and winged
lions (all favorites of Napoleon) peered down from their
nests in the ceiling

Once a formal bedroom the Napoleon Room had been trans-
formed into a makeshift hospital suite In the center

of the room stood a gigantic red Empire Swan Bed surrounded
by anachronistically modern medical equipment soft fluores
cent lights heart and pulse monitoring devices stainless
steel tables and glistening instruments

On the bed lay Baptiste Gaulois his body and face swathed
in white bandeges Pillows hadbeen placed under his head
so that he might have a view of the room - if he were
conscious thet is A doctor (MICHEL) and NURSE stood at
his bedside

Behind the bed stood a bank of flowers bearing condolatory
messages

Were Baptiste conscious he would have enjoyed the view
For around his bed in a horseshoe formation stood the
hierarchy of the Gaulois Family at a respectable distance
The women were dressed in biack the men wore their
customary dark business suits

- They patiently awaited their turn to go forward one by

one and pay their respects to the ailing Baptiste

only grow tighter

Reno was pensive for a moment but when he spoke it
was in his usual business monotone as if nothing
unusual had happened

Alain quickly located a pen and tablet and brought it to
Michel Michel placed the pen in Baptistes hand and
held the tablet to it

With great effort Baptiste etched a few letters on the
tablet Michel looked at the tablet and passed it on to
the others

When Reno looked at the tablet he saw there the iil-formead

began to make strucs cling sounds After putting his ear
to the old mans lips Miche turned to the others and
sald

MICHEL
He wants Extreme Unction

Reno turned to Jean-Louis

RENO
Get Father Géricault Immediately

Jean-Louis hastened out as the Gauloises settled back

A short time later Jean-Louis walked in with FATHER
GERICAULT The room had been prepared for the sacrament
A small table covered with a white cloth had been placed
near the bed On it had been placed a crucifix a lighted
candle cotton-woeol divided into six parts bread lustral
water and a sprinkler

Wearing a cassock supplice and violet stole and bearing
the O11 of the Sick Father Géricault walked toward
Baptistes bed As he entered the room he said

GERICAULT -
Pax huit domui

Standing the Gaulois family replied

FAMILY
(in unison)
Et omnibus habitantibus in ea

Father Géricault laid the stock of holy o11 on the table
gave Baptiste the crucifix to kiss and began the sacrament
saying

GERICAULT
Asperges me Domine hyssopo

VINT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT °

“While Baptiste Gaulois received the last sacrament NICK
‘CONTRINI was walking through his half darkened cavernous

St-Henri warehouse with Inspecteur de Police Remi Langlois

Nick Contrini was a fiftyish American mafioso who had
developed his personality watching gangster movies

‘Granted he had tried to purchase all the accoutrements

of culture -- 300 suits limousines diamond rings --

with his ill-gctten gains but they had never quite grafted
onto his personality In the end he was just an expen-
sively dressed aging thug

Several stens behind Contrini walked STEPHANO 35 his
righthand man and bodyguard

Contrint and Langlois were walking past a long row of juke
boxes as they talked Contrini had a hand full of dimes
and every time he passed a box he dropped a dime in and
played a song at random In between selections he swigged
from the can of Budweiser in his other hands

LANGLOIS
The whole country is in a panic
The War Measures Act has been
invoked These Separatist kooks
got everybody running crazy Nobody
knows if Cross is dead or-alive
Its just our turn

Contrini pushed a juke selection a French-Canadian version
of an American rock song came on

CONTRINI

(to Stephano)
Just our turn He says its just
our turn

(to Langlois)
Remi when New York calls up
Buffalo and the Big Man in Buffalo
calls me up and asks where the
forty kilos we were supposed to
deliver are what should I do

ive him a history of the radical

movement in Montreal

The next juke box offered a sentimental love ballad
e
LANGLOIS
What are you going to do Tell

the Prime Minister that the ccmmies
took your dope

ote

CONTRINI
if inay just do that

The third juke box added an American Country and Western
song to the mechanical rondo

CONTRINI
But for the time being wetll
concentrate on setting the stuff
back Run all those bastards in
Put the heat on Theyre easier
to handle in jail

LANGLOIS
But weve already thrown everybody
in jail who ever wrote an article
or sang a song

CONTRINI
While youre doing it I want yous
to throw somebcdy else in

LANGLOIS
Whots that

CONTRINI
Jean-Louis Gaulois I want him
out of action for a while You
can do that cant you

LANGLOIS
I can run anybody in as long as
the WMA is in effect

CONTRINI
Gocd Do that

By the time Contrini had made his sixth juke box selection
the huge warchouse was an echoing cacophony of French-
Canadian popular music

off with his hand The Guard meekly complied

STEPHANO
All right hotshot I just want
to know one thing We used to
have a good arrangement The
petit-pegres sold you weapons
you kept us informed of any sociad
disturbances you had planned We
even made it possible for some of

Two huge floral wreathes bearing the simple legends

Baptiste Gaulois were carricd into the Napoleon Room

As the wreathes passed they revealed three men waiting
entrance to Baptistes Room Nick Contrini indecorously

‘wearing a sport coat and Slacks and his two bodyguards

TONY and SALVATORE

Ti-Pierre standing at the door to the Napoleon Room
nodded and Contrini came forward He frisked the Italian
and let him into the room The others waited in the
antechamber oo

CUT TO

INT MARAT ROOM — DAY

James Reno was sitting at his oversized art nouveau desk
when Ti-Pierre knocked and walked in

Contrini is here

Reno stood and Contrini walked in with his bodyguards

CONTRINI
Hello Reno
RENO
Monsieur Contrini
co CONTRINI
You can call me Nick now Jim
RENO
No monsieur I always respect
authority
CONTRINI

I had to pay my respects to Baptiste
He was a great man He was Montreal

RENO
Get to the point Monsieur Contrini

CONTRINI
Im not here to start trouble Reno
I want peace That was a horrible
thing what happened to Baptiste
(NORE)

dite

CONTRINI (CONTD)
As soon as I heard I told my best
men to find them scum what did it
as soon us possible Well we
found them bastards They were
cooling off up near Trois Riveres

Twas Riverese was what Contrini had said As usual
his mispronounced whatever little French passed through
his lips No one knew whether he was just acting dumb

or had tctal contempt for everything French

CONTRINI
The old mans bodyguard was in on
it hes zapped already I got
the other two with me They thought
they could gain my favor by doing
such a thing

Contrini motioned to his bodyguards who exited momentarily
and returned dragging the limp bodies of TWO YOUNG MEN
Both had been beaten drugged and tortured One appeared
to be already dead the other was unconscious

CONTRINI
Tony

Tony slapped the face of the semi-conscious young Man
holding up his face For a moment it appeared as if the
young Man would regain consciousness but then his head
Slumped back to his chest

CONTRINI
Shit He was conscious when we
brought him in here

Contrini reached in his coat pocket and pulled out a
battered black wallet

CONTRINI
Well anyways we know they was the
ones what did it cause they finally
confessed and we found Baptistes
wallet on them Theyd spent all
the money of course

He hands Reno the wallet Contrini did not necessarily
expect Reno to believe this little show and likewise
Reno did not feel required to do so It was just a
polite formality

tf

CONTRINI
What do you want done with them

RENO ae
(sighs to himself) oa
Well that ones dead already
(points)
and I think the others a goner
too

Tony lifted up the head of the first young Man and felt
his pulse
TONY
Thats right boss Hes dead
CONTRINI
It was justice The least I

could do for an old friend like
Baotiste ‘

Reno was silent as the bodies of the Young Men were
carried out It nad been an impressive if somewhat
crude display Reno walked from behind his desk

RENO
Merci Monsieur Contrini I also
have a present for you

Reno walked over to Ti-Pierre Ti-Pierre withdrew 2
small bundle of cloth from his pocket and handed it to
Reno

Reno carried the cloth to Contrini and handed it to him
Contrini accepted the cloth and slowly began to unfold it
His face went white -- but only momentarily - when he
Saw what was inside the cloth

In the cloth laid a cluster of bloody white teeth

Contrini refolded the cloth and placed it in his pocket
Pondering this a moment he said to Reno

- CONTRINI

one stepped into the great hali he felt he were being
enveloped by the past

Every table commode and console was weighted down with
ornate rocafile gilt bronzes The high walls were inlaid
with broiseries (paneling) with foliate borders and large
earved framed mirrors A full-length oil portrait of
Louis XIV hung on the far wall A blue woven carpet with
a fleur-de-iys design covered the floor and crystal
chandeliers hung from the ceiling on golden chains

If it were not for the somber men in black suits sitting
around the long table one might have thought he were in
Versailles itself

Approximately ten men were seated around the long carved
mahogany table James Reno Jean Gaulois Jacques Giroux
and Alain Giroux sat at the far end the other men were of
lesser importance

Jean Gaulois stood to speak

Baptistes hand again moved from side to side

RENO
Father please give me your blessing

‘Baptiste continued to protest ‘Renos voice cracked

with emotion as he fell to his knees at his fathers

bedside

RENO
Please father I cannot live
Without your favor

Summoning his remaining strength Baptiste again shook
his hand from side to side

In desperation Reno took his fathers hand and physically
halted his fathers protests Like Esau to Issac he
pleaded on

RENO
No Papa I demand your blessing
I will not leave this room without it

Reno slowly forced his fathers hand up and down Then
releasing Baptistes hand he tentatively awaited his
fathers reaction

The old mans hand was still for a moment then slowly
moved up and down Yes

Reno sunk his fore nead to the side of the bed and wept’ --
the dry tears of relief and exhaustion Baptistes hand
collapsed He was dead

EXT ST-VINCENT COMPOUND - DAY

An unsorted collection of revolutionaries newspapermen
professors intellectuals common criminals and just plvin
scared citizens sat in the open air compound of StVincent
de Paul Penitentiary They didnt seem to have any super-
vision or purpose some wore only partial uniforms (a
shortage due to a sharp rise in the prison population)
Most were involved in the self-absorbtive tasks which

make confinement tolerable cleaning fingernails drawing

patterns in the dust and so forth

Paul Sauvage deeply involved in a discussion sat at the
head of the row the middle of the row was occupied by a
series of more dispir ited and nonconformist types and at
the end of the row alone sat a thirtiesh French gangster
pissed off as much by the fact that he nad to associate
with such ragamuffin good-for-nothings as by the fact he
was in prison -

Jean-Louis looked disdainfully from side to side then
back at his shoelaces

cur TO

INT ST-VINCENT CELL BLOCK - DAY

The motley line of prisoners routinely filed toward their
cells Paul Sauvage standing toward the end of the line
whispered something to Jean-Louis who stood ahead of hin
Jean-Louis nodded and shuffled forward

When Jean-Louis reached the door the GUARD stretched his

arm across the opening indicating that he should take the
adjoining corridor Jean-Louis turned and trod toward it
He was followed by Sauvage and three burly prisoners

IN THE ADJOINING CELL BLOCK Jean-Louis trudged rotely

down the long corridor toward the closed door at the
opposite end

As Jean-Louls and Paul walked past the overcrowded cells
the prisoners Walied one by one to thelr bars Their
faces were filled with anticipation These were hard-

JeanLouis immediately sensed Something was wrong out

walked Jean-Louis halted and stepped back alongside
Sauvage

Jean-Louis hands caught hold of the ceiling pipes and
for a moment he dangied in mid-air Beneath his legs
Paul Sauvage was vainly trying to yank open the locked
cell block door

Jean-Louis swung his body back and with a quick thrust
kicked the eyes of the First Fag with beth feet The
Fag screamed falling back blood coming from his eyes

Sauvage remembering what Jean-Louis had said turned
around and ran down the center of the corridor throwing
a flying tackle at the ankles of the Second Fag The
Fag clubbed Sauvage across the back as he fell

Pulling the blade from his teeth Jean-Louis fell upon
the Second Fag yelling

JEAN-LOUIS
Pan Pan Pan Pan

And stabbed him in the lower throat

Nearby prisoners reached frantically through the bars
clutching at Sauvages arms and legs He had to struggle
to free his foot from a long skinny hand

Jean-Louis pulled his blade from the dead mans throat
and looked up at the Third Fag who was slowly retreating
backwards knife in hand

Jean-Louis stalked him while the prisoners yelled obscene
encouragement to both parties

JEANLOUIS
Etes vous tapette Non vous etes
assassin Vous etes morte

The Third Fag hardly had a chance In two quick false
moves Jean-Louis set hin up and with the third he dumped
in and sliced open his belly Holding his busted gut
the Third Fag fell to the floor

Jean-Louis his shirt splattered with blood walked back
toward Sauvage The cell block quieted down Noticing
the First Fags knife Jean-Louis bent down and picked it
upe

JEAN-LOUIS
Theres some nice 4ron around
here

GONTINUED Sauvage was looking at the body of the First Fag tie
had his hands over his bloody eyes and was moaning in
pain Jean-Louis crouched over him with his bloody
blade a
A BLACK PRISONER near Jean-Louis yelled encouragement
from behind the bars

BLACK PRISONER
Cut off his balls brother cut
off his balls

SAUVAGE
(to Jean-Louis)
Are you going to kill him ’

JEAN-LOUIS
Naturellement

i” SAUVAGE
He ‘cant even see

In a short quick cut Jean-Louis sliced the Fags threat

Jean-Louis stood and stripped off the blood-splattered
shirt Holding up nis bloody knife he turned to the
Black Prisoner

JEANLOUIS
All right brother lets have
your shirt or Ill cut you
(to another prisoner)
And yours too

The two prisoners quickly stripped off their shirts and
handed them to Jean-Louis He wiped his torso with his
old shirt grimacing when he came to the place where hed
been slightly cut by the Third Fag

JEAN-LOUIS
(holding up knife to
all prisoners)
Anybody says anything Ill kill him

Jean-Louls selected the best knife for himself wiped ic
clean and tucked it into his waistband Jean-Louis put
on one of the clean shirts and handed the other to
Sauvage Catching on Sauvage exchanged his bloody shirt
for a clean one

Straightening his shirt Jean-Louls walked toward the
door Paul Sauvage hastened to follow him

Rue de COte-des-Neiges were in bloom and cargo freighters
moved slowly down the glistening St-Lawrence

Nick Contrini and Jacques Giroux were enjoying the sun
at Gibbey’s an outdoor restaurant which had been remo
from the 18th Century Youville Stables in Old Mentrea
Gibbeys was a businessmans favorite and the adjoinin
tables were likewise occupied by executives out for a
little midday sun

Spring had evidently brought out the festive mood in Nieh
Contrini for he had donned an opencollared pink shirt
CH and his Budweiser Sportcoat Jacques preferred the more

somber tones of the Gauloises family

CONTRINI
You think you can handle Jean-Louis

JACQUES
Reno can handle hin

CONTRINI
I missed my chance Now I got to
deal with him

Contrini picked up the luncheon bill and examined it
Sensing Something amiss he took out his pocket calculator
and began tip-tapping the figures on the buttons

JACQUES
Thats not my fault Your fellow
Langlois screwed that

Contrini flubbed the calculation took a drink of Bud-
weiser and started over again And again

CONTRINI

assumed he was shy) -

He smiled and nodded to the girls as he walked toward
Francoise

Two half-dressed Showgiris walked beside Reno and put
their arms around his waist gently tickling and tessing
him Uncomfortable but flattered he smiled at Francoise
trying to maintain his cool

SAUVAGE
Nice digs you got here Contrini
How many people died to pay for
this sturf

CONTRINI
Not enough Spit it out

SAUVAGE
Jean-Louis offer is simple One
hundred thousand dollars He
considers that a very low price
but hes willing to get you a
bargain because of 1 the hassle
youve been through and because
he wants the money in cash in
forty-eight hours

CONTRINI
You can tell that prick to screw ¢
himself I dont get pushed
around by no goddamn radical

1 SAUVAGE
If I dont return with a yes
answer within an hour JeanLouis
will destroy the shit

CONTRINI
Hows he going to do that

SAUVAGE
Well Jean-Louis has several plans
in mind Theres one thatts my
Particular favorite We thought
we would take that forty kilos and
spread them all over the grass at
Pare Mt-Royal so all the Grass
would shrivel up and die and all
Summer long all the little children
would come to the park and wonder
why there was no Brass on the
ground and their mothers would have
to say Therets no grass on the
Ground cause some bad men put
heroin on it Then the reporters
would come by and look at all those
poor little children ana wonder
‘How did all that her-o-in get on
the grass

CONTRINI
All right I wont squabble
Lets make the deal

I didnt think you all-truist doys
went for this sort of thing

SAUVAGE

You know as well as I do Contrini
that if isnt my people it isnt
the Quebecois that can afford to
buy this stuff They have a hard

No let New York pay the price for
its own colonialism Just so it

table drinking beer and Playing gin rummy They wore
Oversized Western Suits that looked like they had been
thrown out by Hank Snow in 1953

Jean-Louis called the BARTENDER over

bottles of liguor and mixer

It took the boozge-addled patrons a moment to catch on
but as soon as fresh drinks started appearing before

and Heres to ya buddy

On stage was one of the French-Canadian Country and
Western groups popular throughout Quebec ‘hese CandW
singers like Levis Boullane Willie Lamothe Rheal
Leroux sing only in French but their songs are usually
about the belles praries of Saskatchewan and Alberta

Mon seul amour cest toi sang the lead singer as he
laid into his fiddle As soon as his bow hit the strings
the room came alive as if touched by an electric wire

A few patrons had already found their way to the dance
floor Gulping down their drinks Reno Francoise
Jean-Louis and Suzanne stood up and joined them

Regularly switching partners they first danced western-
style then close danced then jitterbugsed

Laughing Francoise jumped to the stame and joined the

musicians Dropping her vocal cords an octave Francoise
