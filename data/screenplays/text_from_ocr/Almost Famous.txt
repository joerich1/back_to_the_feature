UNTITLED

A close-shot of a yellow legal tablet A young hand comes
into frame holding a pencil For a few moments we hear only
the soft scratching of pencil on paper as credits are written
in a series of dissolves The hand carefully erases and
corrects an error or two along the way And then the sound of

an old friend the warm crackle of a vinyl record as we
now hear Alvin and the Chipmunks Christmas Song
2 EXT PACIFIC OCEAN -- DAY

A lone palm tree rises up into a yellow afternoon sky Behind
it the sparkling blue of the Pacific Ocean and the city of
San Diego A dry hot Southern California day Even the wind
is lazy anda little bored

3 EXT NEIGHBORHOOD SHOPPING CENTER -
DAY 3

Santa Claus wears shorts and sandals ringing a bell as he
collects for the Salvation Army This is Christmas in the
Southland No snow no winter wonderland Just a pleasantly
thick heat and an unchanging season as music continues

Turning the corner walking into frame is ELAINE MILLER 35
She is a tall woman consumed by the fevered conversation shes

Having with her pale young son WILLIAM late pre-teens They
stand apart from the other shoppers All around them is the
highly-charged salesmanship of the season silver glittering
fake Christmas trees She hurries her son through the
commercial juggernaut continuing their lively intellectual
conversation when something stops her A Workman is affixing
letters to a store-front He has already placed the MERRY
now hes finishing the XMAS Elaine is strong but always
pleasant always clear about her purpose in this life

ELAINE
Excuse me Im a teacher There is no
word in The English Language -- Xmas
Its either Merry Christmas or Happy

Holidays

The Workman nods thanks with faux appreciation as Mom turns
away The Workman shares a look with William who shrugs -
thats my Mom

4 EXT MINI-TRACT CONDO COMPLEX --

DAY 4
This is the new professional-class Its a mini-condo
community Rows of Spanish-styled three-bedroom houses with
common walls Move in on one of these homes the one without

Christmas lights At the door is a furtive 15 year-old Girl
She checks her cheek straightens her hair She hides
something under her coat and gathers the proper nonchalance
to enter Music fades

5 INT KITCHEN -- DAY 5

We now hear the dialogue between this lively Mother and her
son as she cooks a pan full of soy-based health-food cutlets
The meal simmers unappetizingly in the pan Across the kitchen
we see William Hes a great listener with a calm and curious
face that takes everything in

WILLIAM
- so Livia -

ELAINE
-- killed everyone off so her son
Tiberius could inherit the throne
(thoughtful pause)
Just like Nixon

William nods intrigued He has a good disposition The

world of knowledge engages him and he loves what it brings

out in his Mom There is a small clatter at the front door

as the girl weve just seen enters barely brushing some
chimes

She silently curses herself

ELAINE (contd)
Anita is that you

ANITAS VOICE
Hey Mom I already ate

Mom moves to the living room to greet Williams sister
William
peers into the next room

6 INT LIVING ROOM --
DAY 6

Shes almost to her bedroom down the hall when mom catches
her We now discover ANITA 16 up-close She is an alluring
young Natalie Wood with a suspicious and sunny smile

ELAINE
You sure Im making soy cutlets

The words soy cutlets sends a small shiver through the girl

ANITA
Im fine Already ate

William stands in the doorway now watching monitoring as
Mom moves closer to his sister She sees something curious
about her daughter

ELAINE
Wait Youve been kissing
(too

ANITA
quickly)

No I havent

ELAINE

(peering at her lips)

Yes yes

you have

ANITA

No I havent

ELAINE

Yes you have I can tell

ANITA

(boldly)
You cant tell

Mom steps closer and examines the lips even more carefully
To her everything is a quest for knowledge

ELAINE

Not only can I tell I know who it is

Its Darryl

Anita is stunned silent

She turns slightly to look at herself

in a hall mirror searching for clues implicating herself

immediately

ELAINE (contd)

And what have you got under your coat

This is the booty Anita didnt want to give up Mom picks at
the corner of an album cover now visible under her jacket
She withdraws the album Its Simon and Garfunkels Bookends

ANITA

(busted)

Its unfair
our music

that we cant listen to

ELAINE

(weary of the issue)

Honey its
promiscuous

all about drugs and
sex

ANITA

Simon and Garfunkel is poetry

ELAINE

Yes its poetry Its the poetry of
drugs and promiscuous sex Look at
the picture on the cover

CLOSE ON BOOKENDS ALBUM COVER

Moms fingers at the edges We examine the insolent faces on

Richard Avedons classic album cover

Even Simon and Garfunkle

look guilty under her scholarly inspection

ANITA

ELAINE (contd)
honey theyre on pot

First it was butter then sugar and

white flour
(beat)

Bacon Eggs bologna rock and roll

motorcycles

Nearby William squirms as he watches the gently escalating
conversation Anita glances at her brother He silently

urges her to downshift She cant

ANITA (contd)
Then it was celebrating Christmas on a
day in September When you knew it
wouldnt be commercialized

ELAINE
That was an experiment
understand -

ANITA

But I

What else are you going to ban

ELAINE

Honey you want to rebel against

knowledge

ELAINE (contd)
Im trying to give you the Cliffs
Notes on how to live in this world

ANITA

(simple and direct)
Were like nobody else I know

These are the words that sting Mom most

ELAINE

Im a teacher Why cant I teach my

own kids
(pats chest)
Use me

ANITA

Darryl says you use knowledge to keep
me down He says Im a yes person
and youre trying to raise us ina

no environment
ELAINE
(immediately cant help
it)

Well clearly no

Anita gasps Ever the peacemaker William weighs in Nearby

is a poster - No More War

WILLIAM
Mom --

ELAINE

Everything I say is wrong

ANITA

I cant live here I hate you Even

William hates you

WILLIAM
I dont hate her

ANITA
(to William)

You dont even know the truth

William looks vaguely confused

ELAINE

Sweetheart dont be a drama queen

Anita takes a breath and then out of her mouth comes the
strangled-sounding words of a kid swearing at her parent for

the first time

ANITA
Feck you All of you

ELAINE
Hey

Anita runs down the hall to her room

Elaine turns to William

relating to him more as a fellow parent than a child
NIGHT

ELAINE (contd)
Well there it is Your sister using
the fÂ£ word

WILLIAM
I think she said feck

ELAINE
(sputtering)
Whats the difference

WILLIAM
(encouraging)
Well The letter u

Shot moves in on the kid as we hear the opening strains of
The Moody Blues Nights in White Satin

7 INT SCHOOL DANCEGYMNASIUM BATHROOM --

Music continues Shot moves along a row of very mature-looking
male teenagers examining themselves in the bathroom mirror
Theres the kid with a very mature-looking moustache the kid
proudly sporting full-blown hormonal acne (he slaps on some

Hai Karate) the guy to whom puberty has already delivered the
face of an adult complete with long jutting sideburns and
then a blank space at the mirror as the shot moves down down
down to find William He is so much younger without a zit in
sight Puberty is so very distant on his horizon

8 INT DANCE -- NIGHT -- UNDER-

CRANKED 8

DAY

Song continues as we see Williams perspective of these much-
older looking kids Girls now are visible and they are even
more mature than the boys weve just seen They flirt and
glow arms trailing across the shoulders of the boys
Whispering in each others ears none of them looking down
Its a troubling experience to be this close to the alluring
world of older teenagers and to be so invisible to them

VOICE (0S)
Are you really in our grade

9 INT JUNIOR HIGH LOCKER ROOM --

VOICE
(louder)
Are you really in our grade
William turns to see tall adenoidal TIM TOBIN The most
mature

looking kid weve seen yet he challenges William in a loud

theatrical tone It is a voice right out of Guys and Dolls

which incidentally is the school play in which Tobin had just

starred William answers in a respectful voice He is

desperate for acceptance

WILLIAM
Yeah

TOBIN
Hey guys Check it out William
doesnt have any pubes

Others now begin to gather around examining William He has
never been more naked

Guy 1
How old are you man

TOBIN
Hes not a man hes a little baby
kid He Doesnt even get zits yet

GUY 2
How come you dont have any hair down
there

TOBIN

(in loud funny voice)

Their voices echo off the tiled walls Now everyone is
watching

the hairless William He is confused by their meanness

Guy 2
Yeah Where are your pubes

All eyes are on him waiting for a response The kids mental

wheels turn frantically And from somewhere comes an attitude
a swagger and somehow the perfect line arrives from what could
only be a merciful deity

WILLIAM
(cool dismissive)
I had em I shaved em off

It is a new persona for the kid -- the witty guy And it
works

Guy 2 cracks up then others Williams new accuser is
suddenly surrounded by the impressed gales of laughter of these
older boys Others turn away on to other things Tobin
stares

at William and then also turns away

10 INT FAMILY CAR --
DAY 10

William jumps into the backseat of the white Ford Country Sedan

station wagon carrying books (See ya pubes) Mom
continues

driving William and Anita home from school

ELAINE
(cheerfully by rote to
William in back)
Put on your seatbelt I dont want
you flying through the windshield

Anita examines her own un-fastened seatbelt which Mom hasnt
noticed

WILLIAM
We got our annuals today --

ELAINE
(cheerful automatic)
Received your annual

WILLIAM
(looking at his photo)
I look so much younger than everyone
else

ELAINE
Enjoy it while you can

Camera drifts from Mom to Anita who can take it no longer

ANITA
Mom Its time

ELAINE
(pleasant pointed)
Can this wait until we get home

ANITA
Mom pull over Tell him the truth
Tell him how old he is

Mom pulls over and stares straight ahead with deep irritation
They call him

Their silence

A heavy quiet

ELAINE
(as in be quiet)
He knows how old he is

ANITA
The other kids make fun of him because

of How young he looks Nobody includes

him
The Narc behind his back

WILLIAM
They do

ELAINE
Whats a Narc

ANITA
(bleeding for her brother)
A Narcotics Officer

ELAINE
Well whats wrong with that

WILLIAM
(ever the peacemaker)
Come on you guys Its no big deal
Im 12 Its okay She skipped me a
grade its okay Big deal Ima
year younger Theyre 13 Im 12 --
(beat)
Arent I
is eloquent
ELAINE

(confessing in a rush)
I also put you in first grade when you
were five and never told you

WILLIAM
(trembling)
So Im how old

She and his sister ignore him as they now

debate the subject with each other

ANITA
You lied to him You make such a big
deal about the truth and you lied

ELAINE
He looks at his body
New sounds come from way down deep inside
trying to stem the leak She starts the car

speed-rapping

(that one hurts)
He never asked

ANITA
What -- like hes going to ask if hes
as old as he thinks he is Dont you
realize this is going to scar him
forever

ELAINE
Honey sweetheart dont be
Cleopatra We have to be his mother
and his Dad

ANITA
You put too much pressure on him

WILLIAM
(apprehensive)
How old
ANITA

And when he rebels in some strange and
odd way dont blame me

WILLIAM
am I

ELAINE
(matter of fact)
I skipped you an extra grade Youre
eleven

WILLIAM
(horrified voice crackling)
ELEVEN

ELAINE
So you skipped fifth grade Theres
too much padding In the grades I
taught elementary school 5th grade -
unnecessary Nothing happens in the
5th grade All Teachers know it no
one talks about it

WILLIAM
(still in shock)
E - leven

the information affects him physically
Mom now begins
ELAINE
And you skipped kindergarten because I
taught it to you when you were four

WILLIAM
(still horrified looking
at his body)
This explains so much

ANITA
Youve robbed him of an adolescence

ELAINE
Adolescence is a marketing tool

ANITA
Hes got no crowd no friends

WILLIAM
Okay

Anita reaches out to her brother With the compassion of a
saint she offers this

ANITA
Honey I know you were expecting
puberty Youre just going to have to
shine it on for a while

Deeply embarrassed William shrinks down in the seat Mom
monitors his face constantly She is raw and sincere and
yes inspiring

ELAINE
Who needs a crowd Youre unique Youre
two years ahead of everybody Take those
extra years and do what you want Go to
Europe for a year Take a look around
see what you like Follow your dream
Youll still be the youngest lawyer in the
country Your own great grandfather
practiced law until he was 93 Your dad
was so proud of you He knew you were a
pronominally accelerated child

ANITA
What about me

ELAINE
(heartbroken cant help
herself)
DAY

Youre rebellious and ungrateful of my

love

William finishes the last of many candy bars A mound of
wrappers sit just below the mirror He examines his face
hopefully for zits Nothing coming We begin to hear Simon
and Garfunkels America

12 INT LIVING ROOM -

Anita stands in the living room The song continues playing
on the stereo

ANITA
I want to play you a song that explains
why Im leaving and try to listen

ELAINE
We cant talk We have to listen to
rock music

13 EXT FRONT LAI --

William watches sadly Anitas good-looking boyfriend DARRYL
a dead ringer for young Stephen Stills loads her suitcases
into a large turqouise Chevy The suitcases are adorned with
plastic stick-on flowers All coolness is leaving Williams
life Mom watches nearby worried and helpless (Their house
is more austere less fun than the other front lawns)

WILLIAM
Take good care of her in San Francisco
man

Darryl gives the kid a sub-human look Hes invisible too
young to converse with

ELAINE
How can she leave such a loving family

Anita turns and heads towards them She focuses on William
placing her hands on his young shoulders Her face is very
close to him now as she delivers this sage prediction of the
future

ANITA
One day youll be cool

He nods stoically hopefully He is utterly lost She leans
forward and whispers in his ear

ANITA (contd)
Look under your bed Itll set you
free

Anita shakes hands with Mom and exits As the car takes off

ELAINE
Shell be back

In the distance we hear the whoop of her daughter

ANITA
YEAHHHHH-HOOOOOOOO

ELAINE
Maybe not soon

William watches wistfully He moves away from his mother
She pulls him closer Shot moves in on his slightly fearful
face

Anita looks back at the receding American Gothic-image of her
mother and brother Sister waves to brother She feels for
him Music now shifts to The Whos Sparks

15 INT BEDROOOM --

William locks the door He reaches under his bed Its a
black leatherette travel bag with tartan design He unzips
the bag -- its filled with albums He flips through the
amazing subversive cache of music Creams Wheels of Fire

Stones Get Yer Ya Yas Out The Beach Boys Pet Sounds

lighting a candle

faces smile strangely laughing He takes a few steps and
looks up to see a school official is hurriedly removing
something from the high-school marquee

HIGH-SCHOOL MARQUEE
which reads WILLIAM MILLER IS TOO YOUNG TO DRIVE (OR FUCK)

All are laughing He laughs with them and turns as his face
goes slack He shrugs marches on

20 EXT DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO RADIO STATION --

The song weve been listening to is ripped off the turntable by
a highly-active man in a red promotional t-shirt proclaiming

greatness of The Guess Who He is a ferocious lumbering

driven presence and he fills this small radio studio to the
very brim This is LESTER BANGS 25 the rarely-seen God of a
then new art-form -- Rock Journalism A Disc-jockey with long-
long hair watches helplessly William views all this through a
glass window He stands on the corner of a downtown side
street halfway up a steep incline He is the only person on
the streets this early Saturday morning Reveal that he is
watching a live radio show audible to us through the small
pa speaker overhead

DISC-JOCKEY
Quite an honor to have the Worlds

Greatest Rock Critic and editor of

William watches intently Bangs thuds the needle onto a copy
of Raw Power Were rewarded with a blast of Iggy and the
Stooges Search and Destroy A closer shot on William now
watching the whirlwind of anarchy inside Lester does an Iggy
Pop impression acting out a story for the dj that we cannot
hear never noticing the kid soaking in everything from the
other side of this double-glass window

22 EXT RADIO STATION -- DAY -- LATER

Bangs walks with William on this sharply inclined San Diego
street Its early the streets are silent Bangs is about
fifteen beer pounds overweight His jeans are loose his
paleness and messy moustache an emblem of the long days and
nights spent writing In there somewhere is a good-looking
guy His hands are thrust deeply into his pockets and he
takes big sweeping steps

BANGS
So youre the one whos been sending
me those articles from your school
newspaper -

WILLIAM
Ive been doing some stuff for a local
underground paper too

BANGS
What are you like the star of your
school

WILLIAM
They hate me

BANGS

Youll meet them all again on their
long journey to the middle

The kid nods they walk
BANGS (contd)
Well your writing is damn good Its
just a shame you missed out on rock
and roll

WILLIAM
I did

BANGS
Oh yeah Its over

WILLIAM
Over

BANGS
Over You got here just in time for
the death rattle the last gasp the
last grope

WILLIAM
Well At least Im here for that

Bangs looks at the much smaller kid shaking his head Its
too late for newcomers But if the kids age is an issue he
doesnt mention it Like a machine-gun

BANGS
What do you type on

WILLIAM
Smith-Corona Galaxis Deluxe

BANGS
You like the new Lou Reed

WILLIAM
(automatic)
The early stuff The new stuff hes
trying to be Bowie he should be

WILLIAM
(standing his ground)
If you like Lou

BANGS

WILLIAM
No

BANGS
Smart kid I used to do speed and
sometimes Nyquil and stay up all night
writing and writing like 25 pages of
dribble about you know the Guess
Who or Coltrane just to write you
know with the music blasting

WILLIAM
Me too The writing part

For a moment the serious demeanor dissolves and the oddest
thing happens Bangs laughs Its an odd and charming laugh
the kind a tough guy keeps well-hidden It surprised the kid
who smiles back Bangs stops at the corner and offers a
pleasant but very final nod of the head

BANGS
Well alright Its been nice to meet
you Ill see you around Keep sending
me your stuff

WILLIAM
Okay See you

BANGS
I cant stand here all day talking to
my many fans

WIDE SHOT - SOLITUDE

But neither have anywhere to go on this early downtown morning
They stand for a beat hands in pockets on this deserted
street They are alone together theres nobody else in sight

23 INT DINER --

William listens intently as Lester eat a sandwich His face
is an open book filling with words

BANGS
-- so anyway youre from San Diego
and thats good Because once you go
to LA youre gonna have friends
like crazy but theyll be fake friends
theyre gonna try to corrupt you The
publicists The bands You got an
honest face theyre gonna tell you
everything But you CANNOT make friends
with the rock stars

The kid takes out a green collegiate notebook and gestures --
can I make a note Bangs nods

BANGS (contd)
Cannot make friends with the rock stars
(savage bite)
Thats whats important If youre a rock
journalist a true journalist -- first you
will never get paid much But you will
get free records from the record company

The kids eyes widen Bangs in direct conflict with his
brutal

writing style is looking suspiciously like a compassionate

softie

BANGS (contd)
And theyll buy you drinks youll meet

girls theyll try to fly you places for
free offer you drugs I know It
sounds great But they are not your
friends These are people who want you

to write sanctimonious stories about the
genius of the rock stars and they will
ruin rock and roll and strangle everything
we love about it

Privately William thrills We Our It all sounds great to
him He listens to the grouping of the words every one of
them He madly scribbles

BANGS (contd)
They are trying to buy respectability
for a form that is gloriously and
righteously -

The kid leans forward as Lester finds the right word

BANGS (contd)
- dumb And youre smart enough to
know that And the day it ceases to
be dumb is the day it ceases to be
real Right And then it will just
Become an Industry of Cool

WILLIAM
Industry of cool
NIGHT

BANGS
And thats what they want And its
happening right now Im telling you
youre coming along at a very dangerous
time for rock and roll The war is
over They won 99 of what passes
for rock now SILENCE is much more
compelling Its over I think you
should turn around and go back and
be a lawyer or something but I
can see from your face that you wont
I can pay you thirty-five bucks Gimme
a thousand words on Black Sabbath

WILLIAM
(attempting cool)
An assignment

LESTER
Yeah And you should build your
reputation on being honest and
unmerciful

WILLIAM
(writing in notebook)
Honest unmerciful

BANGS
And if you get into a jam -- call me
I stay up late

Bangs reaches across the table and William watches as he
scribbles his number on the back of the kids green collegiate
notebook The notebook has just become valuable They sit
together listening to the beautiful and compelling silence

24 INT FAMILY CAR --

Mom drives William to the San Diego Sports Arena She looks
out the window at the adrenalized concert-goers She feels
protective not just of her son but an entire generation
William goes over his questions for Black Sabbath

ELAINE
Look at this An entire generation of
Cinderellas and theres no slipper
coming

William looks out the window at the sign TONIGHT - SOLD OUT -
BLACK SABBATH with special guest Stillwater
family

NIGHT

WILLIAM
You can drop me off here

ELAINE

Black Sabbath Just remember - you
wanted to be Atticus Finch in To Kill
a Mockingbird

The kid doesnt answer He silently goes over his questions
ELAINE (contd)

As long as know this is just a hobby
Ill go along with it

WILLIAM
All I have to do is listen Thats
what Lester Bangs said

ELAINE
(dryly)
Ill be waiting right here at eleven
o clock sharp If you get lost use
the family whistle

He unhooks his seatbelt stuffs his questions into an orange
canvas shoulder-bag and exits

Elaine watches her son disappearing into the stony rock-concert
crowd Its a windy night Everything about this image
troubles her She fights with herself and then uses the

whistle immediately He turns

ELAINE (contd)
(sweetly too loud)
Dont take drugs

Fifteen concert-goers turn around instinctively at the sound
of a Mother and then identify William as the object of her
concern All around him we hear

HAPPY CONCERT GOERS
Dont take drugs

He winces nods and moves forward Music echoes from the open
windows of many other cars

25 EXT SAN DIEGO SPORTS ARENA BACKSTAGE RAMP --

The kid tromps down the steep incline leading to a small steel
backstage arena door He rings the buzzer The door wheezes
everything

NIGHT

open to reveal the keeper of the San Diego Sports Arenas
backstage list Famous to all those who attempt to enter
this is SCOTTY He is a wiry humorless man for whom
powerlessness is the theme of his life -- except for those few
hours he controls the list Scotty is only forty but

about him screams that hes an angry sixty

WILLIAM

Hi m William Miller and Im here
from Creem Magazine to interview the
band Black Sabbath

Scotty immediately suspicious moves to a nearby podium and
snaps through three clipboard pages He moves back to the
door and grabs the handle

SCOTTY
Not on the list

He shuts the door with finality The kid stands silently for
a moment He looks over his shoulder at two chattering
Groupies watching his dilemma from the top of the ramp They
look at him sympathetically but he turns away William rings
the buzzer again withdrawing a copy of Creem from his bag
The door opens

WILLIAM
Sir Im a journalist and heres a
copy of the magazine

The magazine hangs in mid-air

SCOTTY
Youre not on the list Go to the
top of the ramp with the girls

Slam William stands there for a moment Unsure of what to
do next he looks back to the top of the ramp Rejected by
him just moments earlier the groupies now feign disinterest
Bracing himself William rings again The door opens slowly
this time Scotty stands peering at him

WILLIAM
(in a rush)
What-happens-after-I-go-to-the-top-of-
the-ramp with-the-gi -

Slam Lock

26 EXT TOP OF SPORTS ARENA RAMP --

William inches into the realm of the girls at the top of the
ramp The wind whips Its just him and two Groupies in
their evening best They now pretend to barely notice the
young journalist who has been banished to stand with them
Chattering excitedly with sophistication far beyond her 17
years is ESTRELLA She sports long unruly black hair Her
partner hangs in the shadows adjusting shoes Estrella turns
to the kid with great disinterest

ESTRELLA
Who are you with

WILLIAM
(embarrassed to be alive)
Me Im with myself

ESTRELLA
No who are you with What band

WILLIAM
Im here to interview Black Sabbath
(beat)
Im a journalist Im not a you

know

Estrella stares at him Moving into the parking lot light
introducing herself is a luminous girl in a green faux-fur
trimmed coat This is PENNY LANE There is an inviting warmth
and real interest in the way she asks

PENNY LANE
youre not a what

WILLIAM
(enthralled)
Oh Im just not a you know

PENNY LANE
Not a what

WILLIAM
(charmed)
You know A groupie

The two girls are deeply insulted by the word

ESTRELLA
Ohhh

WILLIAM
Sorry I
PENNY LANE
We Are not Groupies

Estrella indicates Penny with great reverence

ESTRELLA
This is Penny Lane man Show some
respect

WILLIAM
-- sorry

Penny steps closer focusing completely on the kid Behind
her concert-goers throw a few woo-woos their way She seems
not to hear them

PENNY LANE
Groupies sleep with rock stars because
they want to be near someone famous
We are here because of the music We
are Band Aids

ESTRELLA
She used to run a school for Band Aids

PENNY LANE
We dont have intercourse with these
guys We support the music We inspire
the music We are here because of the
music

William is nodding like a doll in a dashboard window
Listening

ESTRELLA
Marc Bolan broke her heart man Its
famous

PENNY LANE

Its a long story Im retired now
Im just visiting friends

ESTRELLA
She was the one who changed everything
She said no more sex no more

exploiting our bodies and hearts

WILLIAM
Right Right

ESTRELLA
just blow-jobs and thats it

WILLIAM
Okay Well see now I get the
difference

Shot drifts off him and picks up out of the darkness another

breathless girl teetering on tall shoes She is in the
vicinity

of 16 Her black hair is cropped short and died red just

like the cover of Bowies Aladdin Sane She is POLEXIA the
voluptuous one from Riverside

Silent beat

POLEXIA
(the usual greeting)
Its all happening Its all happening

ESTRELLA
Polexia Did you tell Sabbath we
were going to be here

POLEXIA
I talked to Dick with Stillwater I
talked with Sabbath Theyre all dying
to see us Its all happening

PENNY LANE
This is our journalist friend
Journalist Friend meet Estrella Starr
and Polexia Aphrodisia And you are --

WILLIAM
William

His name lands like a thud

POLEXIA
Here comes Sabbath

ESTRELLA
Ozzy Tony Its us

A long black limo with darkened windows swishes past
twice The metal backstage gate rises and the limo rolls

inside And then silence again

being rebuffed

ESTRELLA (contd)
I think I saw Sapphire in there

POLEXIA
(cant hold it in any longer)

beeps

The girls do not discuss
Okay I was with Ian Hunter all night
at Rodneys Last night Wanna see his
spoo I saved it in a baggie

She opens her purse and shows the girls something inside
William edges away

ESTRELLA
(peering into purse)
Im really happy hes doing so well

PENNY
(regarding whats in purse)
Yeah I know hes such a talented
guy I mean look at him Who deserves
it more

POLEXIA
(looking in purse)
Nobody -- hes so sweet

ESTRELLA
(with compassion)
Dont you just root for him you know
To go that little distance between
good and great

PENNY
Wait Thats not his I would know
his

A very odd look on his face William now cranes for a discreet
look Whats in that purse

BAM -- THE BACKSTAGE DOOR OPENS

Out steps SAPPHIRE 19 a tall girl with taller platforms

Heavy
eye-makeup Her accent is Texan with odd traces of English
In one hand is a half-drained bottle of champagne In the
other
a fistful of backstage passes
SAPPHIRE
Does anybody remember laugh-tah
(as they turn)
Come and GET EM
The girls scream and happily head down the ramp to Sapphire
Penny looks back and grabs William with a well-placed arm
hooked

around his He joins the clacking sea of legs moving down the
ramp Sapphire slaps passes on the girls As Scotty (The
Keeper of the Backstage List) watches Penny now slips William
forward for a pass

SCOTTY
Oh no Not this one --

SAPPHIRE
(off William)
Who brought Opie

The kid looks over his shoulder Whos Opie

PENNY
Hes with us

SCOTTY
(hand blocking William)
He wasnt with you

SAPPHIRE
(to Scotty)

Are you going to turn this into a
Thing

SCOTTY
All of you can wait outside Top of
the ramp

WILLIAM
I dont want to cause a Thing Ill
wait

PENNY

(privately to William)
Ill go take care of this

Sadly they leave him behind The thundering arena sound of
the collecting crowd the pa system blasting Yes
Roundabout purposeful roadies carrying guitar cases
the glimpse of backstage rock and roll everything he wants
to be a part of is on the other side of this door And then
it shuts He stands alone

At the top of the ramp a tour bus unloads It reads --

STILLWATER TOUR 73 Moving loudly out of the bus is the
opening

band This is Stillwater Four road-weary band members and

their road manager Voices booming

RUSSELL HAMMOND 27 presses the buzzer with the nose of his
guitar-case Its obvious from moment one This is the star
the

JEFF

his

LARRY

with

of the band the charismatic one Hes tired Theyre late
William recognizes him instantly as the guitarist stretches
The buzzer goes unanswered The kid is invisible to him as
the others now arrive behind Russell

Tourband manager DICK ROSWELL 27 follows loudly banging on
the steel door He has the flaxen-haired look of a former
hippie but he carries the emblem of a real pro -- the newest
silver Halliburton briefcase covered with backstage passes
His direction is always - forward

DICK
Let us in were Stillwater Were on
the show
William is surrounded by them now They stand together under
single lightbulb familiar faces a live-action album cover

BEBE the singer his shiny black hair hanging in sheets around

head ED VALLENCOURT the quiet drummer his long arms hanging
limply at his sides His is a face made for the background

TURNER the compact bass-player Dick now kicks at the door

his foot as William produces a copy of Creem Magazine

WILLIAM
(to Dick)
Hi Im a journalist I write for Creem

Magazine
Once again the magazine hangs there He cant give it away

JEFF
The enemy A rock writer

WILLIAM
(struggling forward)
Id like to interview you or someone
from the band

DICK
(busy running behind)
Im sorry but could you please fuck
off

William blinks a little takes it in stride Russell sizes
him up moving in the background

WILLIAM
Okay Okay I could do that

JEFF
You guys never listened to our records
Youre all just frustrated musicians
Do you know what your magazine SAID
about us What was it - the singers
incessant cater walling distracts From
an assault with no clear purpose

LARRY
(in background)
That was Rolling Stone

RUSSELL
Yeah Okay Fuck off anyway We
play for fans not critics

Stung William shrugs Its been a terrible night but at
least thrillingly so

WILLIAM

Russell Jeff Ed Larry

(cant help it)
I really love your band I think the
song Fever Dog is a big step forward
for you guys I think you guys
producing it yourselves instead of
Glyn Johns was the right thing to do
And the guitar sound was incendiary

(gestures with fist)
Way to go

He turns and leaves beginning his long trek back up the ramp
Russell looks at the others That kind of love is hard to
give up

RUSSELL
(good humored yelling)
Well dont stop there

JEFF
Yeah come back here Keep going

They wave him back as the backstage door opens again The
kid moves back down the ramp They herd him in with them
through the door Scotty quickly spots the kid and squares
off

Russell notes the kids swirling emotional state shoves him
forward
SCOTTY
Not this one

RUSSELL
Hes with us

SCOTTY
Hes not with you Hes not with them
Hes not on the list Hes not coming
in And this is my arena And
furthermore -

Russel craves the confrontation and moves forward closer to

Scotty
SCOTTY (contd)
- have a good time tonight Welcome
to San Diego
27 INT BACKSTAGE HALLWAY --
NIGHT 27

The band moves quickly down the hallway with William moving
to keep up A young and grizzled red-haired roadie RED DOG
catches them on the way The band swarms around him

RUSSELL
Red Dog

RED DOG
Were playing here tomorrow night

JEFF
(aside to the kid)
This is Red Dog the Allman Brothers
Bands number one roadie

Russel clamps an arm around Red Dogs neck

RUSSELL
Howre the guys

RED DOG

Havin a ball man When we have a
party we have an Allman Brothers Band

These now

(flashes new mushroom tattoo
on forearm)
Well see you guys in Boston right

(specifically to Russell)
away

and

Dicky and Gregg send you their love

Camera catches flash of envy on the face of Jeff Bebe as
Stillwater sweeps forward into a small dressing room

28 INT DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT

Dressing room activity swirls around him as William simply
listens He holds a small microphone His stoic look gives

little of the full body rush hes experiencing As the other
band members drift across frame Russell Hammond a true rock

roll believer speaks as he straps on his guitar and gets ready
for the show To the kid every word is reckless gem

RUSSELL
and its okay because rock and
roll is a LIFESTYLE anda way of
thinking and its not about money and
popularity

JEFF
Some money would be nice

Jeff sprays some shaving cream into his palm and rubs it into
his scalp - poor mans mousse

RUSSELL
- but its a voice that says here I
am and FUCK YOU if you cant
understand me

Russell smooths the strings of his guitar with a small cloth
from his guitar case The kid notices all these close-up
details of rock

RUSSELL (contd)
And one of those people is gonna save the
world and that means that ROCK AND ROLL
CAN SAVE THE WORLD -- all of us together

The kids eyes dance He checks to make sure hes getting the
recording He listens intently

JEFF
And the chicks are great

RUSSELL
But we didnt do it for that We are
here because we needed to fuckin be
here not just cause we needed to
away from Troy Michigan WHICH WE
DID but what it all comes down to
is that thing The Indefinable Thing
when people catch something from your

music the thing you put into it Im
talking about what am I talking
about
WILLIAM
(elegantly)

The buzz

RUSSELL

THE BUZZ And the chicks the
whatever is an off-shoot of THE BUZZ
And like -- you saying you liked Fever
Dog That is the fucking buzz man
All we get are these fucking old-ass
interviewers who dont understand
dont LISTEN dont appreciate why we
are here which is the fuckin BUZZ

William nods holds his microphone steady Russell tunes his
guitar ripping through unamplified guitar licks as he speaks
Jeff hustles to reclaim his own connection to the interviewer

JEFF
The next album will be even better
More texture

RUSSELL
But its not what you put in is
it Its what you leave out Listen
to listen to Marvin Gaye

Russells face grows rapturous as he discusses this piece of
music

RUSSELL (contd)
A song like Whats Going On That
single woo at the end of the second
verse - you know that woo - that single
woo

WILLIAM
(proudly)
I know that woo

RUSSELL
(he does it)
Thats what you remember The silly
things the little things theres
only one and it makes the song Its
what you leave out Thats rock and
roll

William nods says nothing keeps the microphone pointed
Activity surrounds him

JEFF
(impressed)
We used to talk more about this stuff

RUSSELL
Okay See this is maybe the most
honest weve ever been in an interview
because you know our music Youre
the first press guy weve made friends
with We dont normally talk like
this to them And youre supposed to
be The Enemy What are you - 18

WILLIAM
Yeah

RUSSELL
There you go Still young enough to
be honest

DICK
(walkie talkie crackling)
Ten minutes till showtime anyone who
isnt in the band -- out

Russell takes a last swig of beer A roadie whisks his guitar
away

DICK (contd)
All this luggage is going to LA

William is swept out in the chaos of the pre-show ritual

past the pile of luggage by the door Its a colorful heap of
suitcases featuring colorful laminated band tags each with a
number

29 INT BACKSTAGE STEPS -- NIGHT -- MINUTES
LATER 29

William sits on the backstage steps writing feverishly in his
notebook Behind him two steps higher Penny Lane scoots
into place

PENNY LANE

PENNY LANE

backstage pass form his shirt and puts it on his

thigh - the cooler location Nearby the dressing room door
opens and the Stillwater exits Excitement level rises as
they mass in the hallway with instruments We hear the amped
voice of Russell growing nearer

RUSSELL

The Enemy

He approaches as William stands Penny watches hanging out
of Russells eyesight

Standing in the supercharged hallway the kid is anxious to

introduce his

new friends

WILLIAM

House lights go down Cheers rise Dicks flashlight dances
on the ground just in front of them guiding their way in the
dark to the stage steps

RUSSELL

Russell pulls William into the bands huddle

SHOT LOOKING UP AT THEM

Their band ritual psyching together arms on each others
shoulders in a circle They sing a dew lines of the classic
Train Kept A-Rollin (or Go See Cal from the Cal
Worthington
ad) They all touch feet and then break heading for the stage
Russell directs Penny to his side of the stage The kid
follows
Plugging in still in darkness Russell hits a practice chord -

thwack He steps on effects pedal Applause (Adlib onstage
private patter between members goading each other -- the
stuff

no audience ever hears) Twenty feet away Dick prepares to
LATER

address the crowd from the darkened stage It is his favorite
moment of the evening the highlight of his job

DICK
From Troy Michigan Please welcome --
(importantly)

Stillwater

Light hits the stage and the band launches into their opening
song If You Say Nothing Audience response is strong

Shot lingers on the face of William as he soaks in the most
undeniably exciting moment of any concert the first thirty
seconds

Jeff the singer grabs the microphone and launches into some
vocal pyrotechnics Russell looks over to Penny and William
at stage right grinning pretending to trip on his cord an
elegant show-off move of a musician who is now where he
belongs before seriously stepping forward for the first
guitar lead of the night The kid looks over to see Penny
watching Russell

31 EXT BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT --

Cases are shut and rolled toward the trucks Stillwater heads
for their bus Jeff the singer says goodbye to Estrella Starr
like a sailor leaving port Russell lingers behind saying

goodbye to William loading his own equipment Black Sabbath
passes with entourage heading to the stage

WILLIAM
The Riot House

Elsewhere in the arena Black Sabbath is performing Sweet

Leaf The kid could care less He has bonded with
Stillwater

He heads for the door Penny walks with him Hes loving it

They pass a still-scowling Scotty flashing passes as they

exit out into the ramp area

32 EXT SPORTS ARENA -- NIGHT

Penny takes out an eyeliner pencil writes her number on the
back of his green notebook

PENNY LANE
Call me if you need a rescue We live
in the same city

WILLIAM
I think I live in a different world

They stand in the night air The parking lot is largely silent
now save for the thudding bass sounds of Black Sabbath In
the distance we hear Elaines insistent whistle

PENNY
Speaking of the world Ive made a
decision
(a very serious secret)
Im going to live in Morocco for one
year I need a new crowd
He nods He is a rapt audience for this flashy girl

In the distance we hear the family whistle growing louder

PENNY

He nods cooly He waits until she turns and the sprints
through the parking lot to the distant family whistle

FADE OUT
FADE IN
33 ON TAPE
RECORDER 33

Williams fingers work the clunky keys pressing rewind We
hear a snippet of the intense and lively Stillwater interview
full of overlapping and barely discernible voices
Meticulously he untangles the voices especially Russells
as he transcribes

INT WILLIAMS BEDROOM - DAY

The work of a journalist as William sits at his Smith-Corona
Galaxis There is a knock at the window and William scoots
back in his chair to see a familiar face It is Darryl his

moment passes

Darryl pats his thighs and rises

DARRYL

she knows it

WILLIAM

(loving but firm as if to

a dog)

35 EXT WILLIAMS HOUSE --
NIGHT 35

Penny waist by her car down the hill sporting a different
more elegant look She cups her hands and yells up to him

He hikes down the hill squishing down the water plants almost
falling the first time weve seen him happy in his own skin

36 EXT SUNSET BOULEVARD -- LATER
NIGHT 36

Miss Penny Lanes yellow Vega makes the big swing onto Sunset
Boulevard She sings along to the obscure words of Led
Zeppelins Dancing Days William takes it all in from the
passenger seat Huge billboards advertise not cigarettes or
beer but albums Its a wondrous piece of geography for any
rock fan Shot moves in as William watches takes it all in
He moves his head outside the window to see fully Her
windshield is cracked along the side

PENNY LANE

The Continental Hyatt House Also known
as The Riot House

Every band stays here all the ones

NIGHT 37

Neil Young and Crazy Horses Cinnamon Girl ricochets across

hand steadying her hat at the same time They dart across

the busy street She stumbles a little on her platforms He
steadies his taller date They are a good team as they pass
one of several humming tour busses parked out front

38 INT HYATT HOUSE LOBBY --
NIGHT 38

Penny blasts into the Continental Hyatt House William on her
arm The lobby of this bastion of seventies rock is more alive
than most clubs Its a swirling mass of Roadies carrying
Halliburton briefcases plastered with tour stickers mingling
Rockers and more than a few Groupies with lower-ambitions and
taller-platforms than Penny Lane The feeling is communal
illicit intoxicating The secret community of rock Penny
attracts a hailstorm of friends and comrades

PENNY LANE
Its all happening
(grabbing him like a shield)
And Im about to use you as protection

ROADIE 1

appearance of our friend Polexia

POLEXIA
(in tears in pieces
emotional)
Ian Hunter is a fucking asshole

WILLIAM
Polexia
says

POLEXIA
Opie

She hugs him like a long-lost friend knocking the air out of

him And now overlapping this action
NUNEZ 14 His eyes are forever moist

appears Superfan RIC
but hes oddly formal

and never feels worthy of the rockers he idolizes Tonight he
wears a custom homemade t-shirt with iron-on block letters

It features the four Led Zeppelin symbols and the words TO
BE A ROCK AND NOT TO ROLL A felt-tip pen is still in his

quivering hand Nunez walks with them

RIC

backpedaling as he

Its all happening I just saw them
on the seventh floor Mr Jimmy Page

Mr John Paul Jones
(displays squiggle

on shirt)

Mr Robert Plant signed my shirt in
the elevator Five minutes ago he

PENNY

39 INT HYATT HOUSE LOBBY PHONE -- NIGHT -- MINUTES

Penny nearby as William picks up the house phone He shouts
over the din

WILLIAM
Harry Houdini please

As he waits he discreetly pockets the matches hotel pad and
pencil next to the housephone

40 INT HALLWAYRUSSELLS HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

William Polexia and an ambivalent Penny walk the hallway
looking for the room William looks in the passing open doors
each one a different window into another world

PENNY LANE
Okay Time to put on the lampshade

Up ahead the door to their smallish hotel room is open
Inside a band party in full swing A clunky early-model boom
box segues from James Browns Make It Funky to Led Zeppelins
Gallows Pole Russell Hammond is the center of this party
jabbing out the chords playing along on guitar Much singing
echoes all around Its a hotel-room Hootenanny and all
members of the band are present Penny Lane takes a breath
and enters with arms extended and pointing in opposite
directions She does a flawless stewardess imitation with
proper hand gestures to a loud party ovation

PENNY LANE (contd)
Ladies and Gentlemen Please
extinguish all smoking materials and
notice that the captain has turned on
The No Smoking sign Your seat and
tray tables should be locked in their
full and upright positions

RUSSELLOTHERS
PENNY PENNY LANE

She is instantly and overwhelmingly the life of this party
Russell joins William

RUSSELL
(impressed to see him)
Alright
WILLIAM
(happy to be there)
Alright

Russell places a beer in Williams hands and exits

PENNY LANE
(continuing)
In the unlikely event of a water
landing the seat below you will serve
asa -
(give up)
Oh the hell with it

They all applaud her laughing William watches her with
wonder as she turns his way and winks Jeff approaches the
alluring Polexia and goes to get her a beer Meanwhile
Polexia sidles up to William She sees him watching Penny at
the other side of the room

POLEXIA
(privately)
Act One in which she pretends she
doesnt care about him

POV shot travels to Russell strumming the guitar that is
always

a part of his body Russell is watching Penny Lane

surreptitiously

POLEXIA (contd)
Act Two in which he pretends he doesnt
care and goes right for her

Russell moves towards Penny

POLEXIA (contd)
Act Three in which it all plays out
the way she planned it Shell eat
him alive

WILLIAM
(worried)
Weve got to stop them

POLEXIA
Stop them You were her excuse for
coming here

ON PENNY
PENNY
I need ice

Penny disappears out the door across the hallway Russell

follows a moment later The kids eyebrows rise Polexia

regards the kid with affection adjusting his collar and
peeling

a hair off his jacket

POLEXIA
I just worry about people using her
You know Cause she brings out the
good side in everybody else but what
do they do for her Life kills me
Do you have any pot

WILLIAM
Not on me

POLEXIA
Do you smoke

WILLIAM
No

(attempting to fit in)

But I I grow it I grow it

Polexia looks at the kid laughing at his poor job of lying

POLEXIA
Youre funny You know if you were
only taller English rich a guitar-
player and older

WILLIAM
Id be someone else

POLEXIA
Yeah Good point

Jeff appears with her beer and she whispers in the kids ear
before she exits with Jeff Bebe

POLEXIA (contd)
Bless me father for I may sin tonight

The kid watches as the boom box plays an obscure favorite of
Russells Eddie Giles Losin Boy There is the sound of a
motorcycle somewhere down the hallway

41 INT ICE ROOM --
NIGHT 41
The ice machine makes new cubes with a grinding noise Penny
puts ice in her glass Behind her Russell moves into frame
hands delicately riding the sides of her body A motorcycle
roars by just outside the door as Penny moves away from
Russells exploring hands

PENNY
(with real indignation)
How does it end

RUSSELL
What

PENNY
You know - the story about the girl
who dumps the guy who has an ex-ex
wife -- the one we dont talk about --
and gets a hundred okay five letters
from him and then doesnt even leave
a pass in San Diego Wake up Im
retired and I never believed you anyway
Youre too talented and too good-looking
to be trusted and everybody knows it

RUSSELL
(smiling loves it)
Youre retired like Frank Sinatra is
retired

She makes a scoffing noise He moves to the ice machine with
a glass of his own

RUSSELL (contd)
Miss Penny Lane Let me tell you what
rock and Roll will miss the day you
truly retire

He tosses cubes in his glass one by one After the first
cube

RUSSELL (contd)

The way you turn a hotel room into a
home

(cube)
The way you pick up strays wherever
you go Like Pied Piper

(cube)
The way you know the words to every
song Every song Especially the bad
ones Mostly the bad ones

(cube)
Stewart

That green coat in the middle of summer

(cube)
The real name you wont reveal

PENNY

(quietly)

He kisses her powerfully hands at his sides She fights to
keep her hands off him Bonhams motorcycle rips by just
outside the door

RUSSELL

PENNY

RUSSELL

They kiss The motorcycle speeds by again just outside

42 INT HALLWAY -- NIGHT

The hallways are crowded as William looks at the closed door
of the ice room He leans against the wall alone now Trying
to look like he belongs Behind him most of the band has
disappeared into other rooms leaving only hangers-on in their
places

43 INT ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE -- DAY

Music We pan across cubicles bustling with laid-back fervor
These are the San Francisco-based main offices of Rolling Stone
Magazine We have arrived for the waning days that this
magazine could still be called with a straight-face an
underground publication Their mounting success crowds the
edges of every frame Camera catches the Annie Leibowitz
portraits that hang on the walls -- Lennon Jagger Rod

James Taylor

We find editor BEN FONG-TORRES 29 in his cramped cubicle
Sitting nearby is curly-haired and mustachioed Star Staff
writer DAVID FELTON 32 who smokes his cigarettes with a long
holder Felton reads one of Williams articles chuckling

BEN FONG-TORRES
William Miller

his promotional-material laden-desk automatically plotting
the piece aloud
BEN (contd)
(pleasant terse)

Stillwater Hard-working band makes

who dismissed the first two albums as
workmanlike Guitarist is the clear star
of the band Crazy Lets do three-

44 INT LESTER BANGS HOME -- LATE
NIGHT 44

The great Lester Bangs stands in the promotional album-clogged
bedroom of his Birmingham Michigan homeoffice at Creem
Magazine There is nothing in frame that does not deal with
music In the background a scratchy and chaotic Coltrane
record

LESTER BANGS
Beware Rolling Stone Magazine They
will change your story theyll re-
write it and turn it into swill

Beware

WILLIAM
But besides that what would be wrong
with it

LESTER BANGS
(laughs entertained)
You have starry eyes my friend
(beat)
Look Do the story Its a good break
for ya But remember this --

The kid listens intently and makes notes

LESTER BANGS (contd)
dont do it to make friends with
people who are trying to use you to
further the big business desire to
glorify worthless rock stars like
Stillwater And dont let those swill
merchants re-write you

WILLIAM
(still copying)
swill merchants

LESTER BANGS
Now What are you listening to

45 EXT TEACHERS LOUNGE -- DAY

William knocks on the teachers lounge door A Teacher
answers

protective of their sanctuary

WILLIAM
(urgently)
I need to talk to Mrs Deegan from
Journalism

Mrs Deegan appears in the doorway

46 EXT WILLIAMS HOME -- LATE
AFTERNOON 46

The sun is still shining Its late afternoon as Elaine
Miller

exits her car and arrives home She sees a few extra cars in

the driveway is immediately suspicious

47 INT LIVING ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

Elaine arrives to find William Mrs Deegan and Darryl awaiting
her in the living room Its a 1973-style intervention They
wear sunny compassionate smiles

ELAINE
Whatever it is the answer is no

MRS DEEGAN
Elaine we need to talk to you
Nothing is wrong I ama teacher
Youre a teacher We speak the same
language

Mom sits down She is fully engaged and worried her natural
state

MRS DEEGAN (contd)
Now Im not a jump-up-and-down person
but something wondrous has happened to
William And you have every reason to
be happy

(knows her)
and calm

Carefully gauging Elaines face the teacher continues

MRS DEEGAN (contd)
William has been gifted with a shining
opportunity in the world of journalism
Through a love of music and at an
oddly-young age he has received a major
assignment from a national publication
called Rolling Stone Magazine

Mrs Deegan produces a copy and places it on Elaines lap
It sits there like the plague

MRS DEEGAN (contd)
Now you are rather famously not a fan
of rock music but such are the ironies
of life that happens to be the very
topic of Williams assignment -
(cheerfully)
- rock music A band

ELAINE
(warily to Darryl)
Honey what are you doing here

DARRYL
Moral support

Mom looks evenly at her son seated opposite her in this small
living room

ELAINE
Whats involved

MRS DEEGAN
Well Its a great opportunity Hell
be well-paid and published nationally --
(quickly)
-- and hell go on tour with a rock
band for four days No small planes
he travels on a bus

ELAINE
Is it time for me to say something

MRS DEEGAN
Sure

ELAINE
No

MRS DEEGAN
And in anticipation of that response -

ELAINE
No

MRS DEEGAN
-- William has prepared --

ELAINE
(rueful)
Lo that which I have feared has come
upon me
WILLIAM

(lightening fast)
He who jealously guards his fears
quietly yearns to bring them about

Mrs Deegan admires their high-strung intellectual parrying
makes an impressed noise

ELAINE
(with compassion)

No I have raised him to be an honor
student which he is We have agreed
on all our goals We raised him to be
a lawyer we moved here to be near the
finest law school in the West Plus
he has finals coming up and in one
week he graduates with all his friends

DARRYL
Hes got no friends

WILLIAM
Darryl Please

Nearby having anticipated all of the above William nods to
Mrs Deegan and stands

MRS DEEGAN
Elaine may I present to you your
own son

William takes a lawyerly stroll turns to face his mom

WILLIAM

Lady of the Jury

(beat)
I wish to disprove the prevailing false
belief that rock music is based on drugs
and sex True perhaps at one time
but rock music is different now It is
now performed by hard-working
intellectuals with with blazing
intellectual pursuits and I am going to
play for you a piece of music designed
to show you that my thesis is correct

ELAINE
This is going to be hell

Across the room Darryl takes his position near the stereo

WILLIAM
The song is based on the literature of
Tolkien and its mystical attempt
to elevate humanity has been successful
throughout the world this song
will change your life

Mom stifles a cough William nods to Darryl who reverentially
drops the needle with a thud Mom is trapped as we listen to

silent static and then the opening notes of Led
Zeppelins
Stairway to Heaven William gives his Mother the album

covers inner-sleeve with lyrics

WILLIAM (contd)
We ask you only to listen

Camera passes across their serious and expectant faces The
intro in not short We listen just watching their faces as
Elaine becomes increasingly impatient

ELAINE WILLIAM
When is it going to start - Soon
Immediately overlapping the vocal begins (Theres a lady

whos sure all that glitters is gold)

53 INT LIVING ROOM - LATER AFTERNOON

Moms face remains stoic to the bitter end ( and shes

All look to Elaine They wait on her response We hear the
turntable arm return to its cradle

ELAINE

humanity Sure lets elevate
humanity After we sell you drugs and
sex All I have is my honesty Thats

what I believe and thats what I know
(flipping through magazine)
Oh Heres a nice ad

She holds up the magazine And ad reads in large bold type
BUY THIS FUCKING ALBUM

ELAINE (contd)
Youve clearly ganged up on me and I
still say no No no no no no no no

She shuts her eyes and blurts out something against her better
judgement

ELAINE (contd)
NO MORE THAN FOUR DAYS AND I WANT A
PHONE NUMBER FOR WHERE YOU ARE EVERY
MINUTE AND I WANT YOU TO CALL ME TWICE
A DAY AND YOUD BETTER NOT MISS ONE
TEST - AND NO DRUGS

William nods gratefully and exits frame Hold on the empty
escape

loneliness she got married and then raised a family to

54 INT STILLWATER TOUR BUS --

An empty Heineken beer bottle rolls up and down the aisle
taking us to William William picks up the bottle and places
it in the seat back pocket in front of him He has joined the
circus and the feeling of being here is a lot more lonely and
forbidding than he expected The bus struggles to make it up
the hill back rows shuddering loudly as music continues

56 INT BUS - DAY

William strains for a look at Russell five rows up He plays
slide guitar working out a part Next to Russell is Penny
Lane Penny raises an early-model Polaroid camera and - flash
- takes a picture of a nearby sleeping Jeff Bebe

PENNY
Gotcha

Jeff grumbles from the depths of a hangover Penny stuffs the
shot in her pocket William watches his private heart pounds
Polexia appears and sits next to him noticing his shyness

POLEXIA
Do you have any pot

WILLIAM
No Ima journalist

POLEXIA
Well go do your job then Youre on
the road man Its all happening Get

Challenged William rises and approaches Russell He fixes
the charismatic guitarist in his sights Shot takes him down
the aisle to the jamming star guitarist He crouches in the
aisle and talks to Russell who immediately seems moody His
mood is in the air

WILLIAM
(very professional)
Russell Do you think we might be

able to find some time to talk when we
get to Phoenix I want to interview
everyone separately and I felt wed
start with you and me

Nearby Jeff now listens in feeling immediately jealous

RUSSELL

Russell turns away The kid squats uncomfortably in the aisle
babbling on

WILLIAM
Because Ive got a thing in a couple
days

RUSSELL

WILLIAM

(self-conscious)

Its a thing where uhm you go

RUSSELL
(sharply)

good line William makes a quick jot in his notebook

RUSSELL (contd)
No no no Dont put that in Rolling
Stone My bio says I graduated Well

Just enjoy the ride
NIGHT

Russell eyes the notebook suspiciously before turning away
Penny notices Williams discomfort laughing warmly all while
grabbing a Coke and giving one to nearby bassist Larry

LARRY
How did you know I was thirsty

He didnt even realize he was thirsty but he is He nods
thanks to Penny the perfect road companion for all And then
Penny gives the other Coke her Coke to William He accepts
it too and starts back to his seat Hes been blown off and
he knows it but before he exits Penny grabs his arm and
whispers in his ear

PENNY
I may need to stay in your room tonight
Russells in a bad mood Hes very
Bob Dylan in Dont Look Back today
Hes trying to write

William nods cooly -- they are comrades -- and returns to his
seat A large joint passes in front of him across him to
Polexia as everyone cheers Doris the Bus rumbling up another
hill

POLEXIA
(inhaling deeply)
Want some

WILLIAM
No thanks

A wall of pot smoke is exhaled right into his face It
surrounds him like a cloud The bus shudders as Russell
continues playing slide up ahead

57 INT WILLIAMS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Elaine sits in her living room filled with her books Large

Department store photos of her children on the wall She feels

John Bonhams drums thunder through the bus everybody still
singing as they dip down into the city ahead Phoenix William
watches the living documentary around him He writes furiously
in the green notebook scribbling in the dark trying to steady
his writing on the bumpy bus Behind him someone is beating
along to the song on his seat He never want to leave this

59 INT ARIZONA RAMADA INN LOBBY --

All enter the lobby like warriors in a pack The hotel chairs
are spotted with curious hangers-on decked out and lounging

sad state of hotel service grates on a road dog like Dick He
is forever teaching others their jobs

DICK
Jeff Tony Keys keys keys

He gives key and a stack of messages to Russell and turns to

regarding William standing with Penny and the girls Intrigue
is swirling in the lobby

JEFF

RUSSELL

Rules This little shit is the Enemy
He writes what he sees

it is only because shes good at logistics emotional and
otherwise

PENNY

Polexias not working out with Jeff

to work Tries to catch her watching him again She turns
away just in time

60 INT WILLIAMS HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

ritual of inhabiting a room on the road Sapphire flutters a
paisley scarf over the room lamp Polexia puts a towel along
the crack of the door blows out the glowing embers on too-
many sticks of incense and moves to the phone Estrella has
joined them as well complete with a bag full of shoes

But she continues saying the name in a multitude of different
ways in different accents and with different degrees of
indifference and passion and lust and play-acting and mock-
drama

PUSH IN ON HIS FACE

As he listens and studies this ethereal creature for meaning

Is she mocking him In love with him Taunting him
Seducing
him
PENNY

Leslie Leslie Leslie lLesssssslie

They nod Its a good plan

61 EXT HALLWAY -- NIGHT

The hanging sign on the door reads DO NOT DISTURB William
knocks on Russells door A maid pushes up against him with
her cart which now blocks the hallway

wads of hotel stationery

PENNY

WILLIAM

No Im fine Ill just interview

RUSSELL
(as in youre on of us)
GO AWAY

She shuts the door quickly It hurts a little He picks up
the wadded pieces of paper stuffs them in his pocket He
leaves the door and helps himself to some soap and pencils and
matches from the nearby maids cart Then he returns to
Russells door He cant help but listen to the muffled sounds
of laughter just for a moment escalating He flips the sign
over HOUSEKEEPING PLEASE ENTER - CLEAN ROOM

62 INT OUTER RADIO STATION -

Humble Pie Thirty Days in the Hole Russell and band enter

the radio station passing through the now-empty front office
As always Russell sets the tone Hes feeling good
Stillwater takes over -- they feel mighty like the Beetles
as they climb across chairs rearrange wall hangings and gold
records and head down the small hallway to the control room
interview Rolling with the flow are William and Penny in her
green coat He tries to distance himself from her -- stilla
NIGHT

NIGHT

little stung by the earlier hallway rebuff -- but she will
have none of it She privately shares every great passing
moment with him He tries not to succumb to these charms
Its hard Music segues to Stillwaters own Fever Dog

63 INT RADIO CONTROL ROOM -

Stillwaters own record spins and it sounds good to everyone
in this room Russell takes a seat near the open mike Jeff
Bebe is quick to take the other seat arranging himself to be
just as close to the microphone as Russell William watches
all as he sits at the dark back of this control booth
Stillwater sits with late-night progressive disc-jockey QUINCE
ALLEN 25

Quince takes a long hit from a joint and does not pass it

The entire Stillwater band is now collected in the studio and
ready for the interview William cant avoid looking at Penny
Lane who looks great tonight She catches him and he barely
looks away in time Polexia newly reconciled with Jeff
notices The very mellow disc-jockey eases up to the
microphone as the finale of Fever Dog is just ending

QUINCE ALLEN

QUINCE (contd)

The band scoots closer to the microphone ready to talk
Quince

continues looking meaningfully at the band They are

waiting eager for a chance to speak

QUINCE (contd)
Every minute a baby is born somewhere
Life Death Hermetically sealed
bags of human emotion Bags of love
bags of kindness
(suddenly turns)
Howd you get together

As Jeff eagerly speaks Quince lowers his head and listens

feels the words of his guests
JEFF
Well not to get into a me thing

this is Jeff talking but I did start
the band some time actually ago
This is back when we were the Jeff

Bebe band and I placed an ad ina
magazine called Peaches looking for a
guitarist and Russell Hammond answered

Quince nods head bowed swaying slowly
QUINCE

(with deep understanding)
Peaches
Jeff watches Quinces head lower Its hard to know when to
talk with Quince The depth of his mellowness is tough to get
in rhythm with

JEFF
I think he was a gift from God
actually Nobody plays like Russell
Hammond

RUSSELL
(sorta moved)
Well shit Thank you

He instantly realizes hes slipped on the air

RUSSELL (contd)
Ooops Better hit the delay button

All eyes turn to Quince whose head stays down grooving to
some inner beat He says nothing The band looks at each

other We become increasingly aware that Quince may now be
asleep Long silence William shares an amazed look with

Penny Quince is definitely asleep Russell leans forward
and continues talking quietly with hilarious sincerity

RUSSELL (contd)
Okay - were talking now right Why
the fuck do you wait until and interview
in Arizona to say something nice about
me Why dont you say it to my fucking
face sometime Because I tell you
every time I think you nailed something

JEFF
Everybody pays you compliments Its
not my fucking job to kiss your fucking
ass all the time

RUSSELL
Well then whos fucking job is it
Because my ass is dying for a kiss
And I know yours is too

DICK

geniuses And let me just add this
thought - smegma

Penny covers her mouth as offers a look of absurdity to
William
He offers one back as laughs are stifled throughout the room
NIGHT

William shares a look Quince is still deeply asleep as the
usually quiet tony leans forward to speak

TONY
Feces

He cracks himself up silently Quince snaps awake fully in-
stride

QUINCE
The dong is called Love Thing

Love Thing takes over as Quince swivels in the chair

QUINCE (contd)
I thought that went well

68 INT HOTEL LOBBY --
NIGHT 68

Russell and William sit in two large red-leatherette seats in

the hotel lobby William shuffles through many pages of

questions written in small script His tape recorder
microphone

sits balanced on the chair

WILLIAM

(very professional)
Now that youre starting to be
successful you had twenty-six years
to write your first Album and youll
have maybe four months for the second
Do you worry that the pressure of the
business will get in the way of the
original joy of making your music Or

Russell blinks The all-consuming issues of his life are right
in front of him

RUSSELL
Whoa
(laughing)
I need three more beers and my guitar
before I can answer that question
Lets take a walk

69 EXT HOTEL POOL AREA - NIGHT

Russell walks the outskirts of the pool area with William
William follows him through the sliding glass door to his room
facing the pool Russell grabs his guitar They stand for a
moment unheard by the others and regard the living portrait
twenty yards in front of them The off-limits after-hours
pool area has been overtaken by the Stillwater tour members
Jeff Bebe sits in a chair nearby Dick laughs at a joke
Always the life of the party Penny Lane dispenses stolen
towels
from a maid cart And she is the first to slip into the pool
for some after-hours against-the-rules swimming
Effortlessly
she turns a collection of people into a party They regard
her well out of earshot of the others

RUSSELL
For a minute I thought you were actually
William shuts

a real journalist which is you
know its great

(beat)
Shut that thing off and Ill tell you
the truth

his tape recorder off

WILLIAM
Its off

RUSSELL
Look I trust you Im going to lay
this right on you Just make us look
cool

WILLIAM
I will quote you warmly and accurately

RUSSELL
Thats what Im worried about See -

Some of us have wives And some of
the people you meet on the road are
really amazing people

They both watch Penny Lane sparkling fresh from the pool

She places hotel furniture into the

shallow end and inviting

all even other curious hotel guests to join them in the pool

RUSSELL

(contd)

Like you And some of the things that
happen are good for just a few people
to know about - as opposed to say a

million people
Dawn is breaking for William

WILLIAM
Ohhhh Oh Yeah

RUSSELL
You know what I mean

WILLIAM
Right Yeah

RUSSELL
See youre dangerous

Most people

are just waiting to talk but you

listen
WILLIAM

RUSSELL

(quietly)
I grew up with these guys okay I
cant play all that I can play Im
past these musicians do you understand

WILLIAM

RUSSELL
he more popular we get the more I
cant walk on them the bigger their
houses get the more pressure you
forget man You forget what it was
like to be real to be a fan You can
hear it in a lot of bands whove been
successful - it doesnt sound like
music anymore It sounds like
like lifestyle maintenance
(suddenly confessional)

used to be able to hear the sounds
of the world Everything to me used
to sound like music Everything Now
dont hear it You know what Im
trying to say

fq

WILLIAM
(ruefully)
Yeah

RUSSELL
Man it feels good to say this stuff
out loud But what am I doing Im

WILLIAM
(feeling included)
No thats okay Well do the interview

to the kid and joins the party William watches part of the
crowd somehow feeling a little compromised He doesnt
care Penny gestures for him to join them

70 EXT SUN STADIUM - AFTERNOON

William interviews Larry in the seats of the empty arena On
stage Ed soundchecks his drums

WILLIAM
How would you describe your role in
Stillwater What is the chemical that
you add to the chemistry

LARRY

WILLIAM
(pressing for some poetry)

what would be missing Stylistically
What chemical

LARRY

The bass
Larry doesnt give him much
71 EXT SUN STADIUM -
NIGHT 71

Its raining The pre-show huddle breaks up William a part

of them Penny Lane adjusts Larrys look She takes the scarf
from around his neck and ties it around his leg He looks
instantly better William watches in the darkness as Dick
takes the microphone The best part of his day has arrived

In his important voice
DICK
Good evening Phoenix

(applause)
From Troy Michigan Please welcome
Stillwater
Lights come up as the band launches into Fever Dog Jeff

begins singing Russell reaches to adjust the microphone for
a back-up vocal and is hit with something unexpected

A sharp electrical shock

Its just a slight pop in the loud din of music but within a
moment something is clearly wrong Russell holds onto the
microphone stand with a surprised look conducting high-voltage
for two seconds and then he snaps his hand off the metal His
face is white he takes off his guitar and walks off-stage
collapsing a couple steps later

72 EXT BACKSTAGE --

NIGHT 72
Dick is waving wildly for the band to board the bus which has
been pulled up into the backstage area He guides a sagging
Russell assisted by Penny Lane into the bus
DICK
Get in get in
William boards the bus as the extremely agitated PROMOTER
arrives to confront Dick
PROMOTER
Are you the manager of this band
DICK
That and more Get in
PROMOTER
You didnt even play a full set
Dick whirls and unleashes an anger weve not yet seen
gesturing

with the silver briefcase that does not leave his hand

DICK
Your shoddy stage set-up almost killed
our guitarist

PROMOTER
You trashed the dressing room - you
didnt play your thirty-five minutes

DICK

73 INT BUS --
NIGHT 73

Russell sits pale next to Penny at the front of the bus He
examines his singed hand shaking it a little to emphasize the
positivity of her words

PENNY
Dont worry Its happened to all the
greats Thank God you didnt hold the
mike stand with both hands youd still
be holding it This is a good thing
Its a good good good thing

William sits nearby watching Russell making notes out of eye-
sight of others The ever-wary Jeff unseen by William cranes
to see that hes writing in his notebook

Dick swings into the seat across from Russell The bus door
shuts as the promoter is still yelling

Doris is slow to gain speed as Estrella appears running
alongside She knocks on the window next to William

ESTRELLA
I forgot to tell you Your mom says
to call home immediately She says
she knows whats going on
(receding)
See you guys in Topeka Ill catch a
ride with Sabbath

William nods with embarrassment waves to her as the bus races
toward the now closing gate

DICK
(casually to Russell)
Wanna buy a gate

Before Russell can answer - BASH Doris barrels through the
steel-gate snapping it like a chopstick to great cheers inside
this bus

DICK (contd)
You just bought a gate
(to the bus)
Cmon Doris Get us out of town

The bus struggles up a slight incline everybody rooting for
Doris as she eases out of the parking lot and onto a
thoroughfare

WILLIAM
What did it feel like to be
electrocuted

RUSSELL
It burns It feels like a dose of
lead shooting through your body and
then you see God and he says How
bad do you want to be legendary And
god damnit I let go

(shaky grin as all laugh

warmly)
Rock and roll

Jeff watches this charisma with thinly veiled envy The kid
scribbles in his notebook We hear Led Zeppelins Thats the
Way

74 INT BUS - EARLY
MORNING 74

Song continues Almost everybody is asleep William takes
the camera and snaps a Polaroid of a sleeping Penny She wakes

up

PENNY
Give that to me
She grabs for it they have a brief play-fight He grabs some
other Polaroids from her pocket He hustles to the back of
the bus pockets the photo and settles down to watch the
passing landscapes She chases him down the aisle Music
continues as she sits down next to him Out the window a
long-distance running team of Girls keeps pace with the bus
for a bit They wave Penny watches them over sunglasses
waves briefly to the real world

PENNY (contd)
(breathing heavy owning
the world)
When we go to Morocco I think we should
wear completely different clothes and
be completely different people

WILLIAM
What will our names be

She snaps a Polaroid of a nearby sleeping Silent Ed pockets
the Polaroid She regards Russell up ahead also sleeping
Her attention has already wandered from Morocco

Gravely noting the word problems the kid joins Penny in
watching Russell who is splayed haphazardly sleeping
restlessly up ahead

WILLIAM
What problems
PENNY
Okay I got it I think your name
should be Spencer and mine will be
Jane

WILLIAM
I cant keep up with you

PENNY
No one can

WILLIAM
Whats your real name

She looks at him briefly She puts her arm around him Its

intoxicating but he doesnt quite know how to act With her

free hand she gestures with a hanger As they regard Russell
sleeping nearby

PENNY
Heres the thing about Russell Hes
my last project I only do this fora
very few people And I think we should
do it together - he is almost great
Weve got to take him there You and
me - we can do it Deal Because the

William looking concerned over the state of his interviews
walks into the backstage bathroom He makes a few
surreptitious
notes in his notebook before noticing that Jeff is standing
there clearly just finishing a quick hit of cocaine offered
by a Local Hanger-On Seeing the kid he immediately hides
the coke spoon

WILLIAM
I missed the last thing you said

Mom takes a pause

ELAINE
I LOVE YOU
Penny now enters watching
WILLIAM
WHAT
ELAINE

(angry louder)
I MISS YOU AND I LOVE you

William now notices Penny standing nearby picking at a salad
from a paper dish Looking at her he lets loose with what he
believes is a private confession

WILLIAM
I LOVE you

Penny smiles knowingly collecting his affection like another
backstage pass and turns away Camera stays on William He
is suddenly and deeply embarrassed Hes just told her that
he loves her and she knows it He hangs up traumatized
82 INT TOPEKA DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT

Russells hair is slicked with sweat from a show just finished
He is shirtless with a towel around his shoulders Luggage
for the next city is stacked by the door

RUSSELL
Fire away Im ready Im on the
You Train Take me there

The kid plugs in his microphone Russell listens as he springs
his first question

WILLIAM
Do you have to be depressed to write a
sad song Do you have to be in love
to write a love song Is a song better
if it really happened to you Like
If You Say Nothing where did you
write that and how did it come about

Russell admires the many questions Says nothing He looks
at his hand thinks

RUSSELL
When did you get so professional

In the background Penny Lane irons Silent Eds shirt
Grinning she cuffs his shoulder To the shirtless silent
drummer waiting for his shirt

PENNY
Im almost done with my shirt

Ed watches her appreciatively drumming silently on a rubber
pad Penny kisses Russell who swings her onto his lap In
the corner Jeff watches them all with a vague feeling of being
underappreciated And now Dick enters with a large cardboard
box

DICK
Russell your dad showed up again
And on a lighter note
(importantly)
Gentlemen Your first t-shirts have
arrived

There is an immediate buzz in the room as Dick yanks open the
box filled with new white t-shirts He untangles the first
fresh
shirt and displays it proudly A silent beat as all examine
it -

their first t-shirt Faces fall Ed stops drumming There
has

been a mistake It is a fuzzy band photo with the group name

emblazoned below Only Russell who stand out front is
colored-

in and emphasized on the shirt He turns away making a noise

Jeff stares at the t-shirt Hes just about in tears There
is

a long silence and then Ed resumes drumming on the rubber
pad

DICK (contd)
Its the record companys mistake
And they will pay Shirts gone band
happy

He drops the offending shirt into the trash as if it were
contaminated and exits with the box William watches as the
two men Russell and Jeff move to opposite sides of the room
Russell puts on a shirt so does Jeff The vibe is thick
Russel turns to see Jeff staring at him

RUSSELL
Can we just skip the vibe and go
straight to us laughing about this

JEFF
(bitterly)
Yeah Okay
RUSSELL

(trying for a joke)
Because I can see by your face - you
want to get into this -

JEFF
How can you tell Im just one of the
out-of-focus guys

RUSSELL
Here we go

William watches as Russell fishes the t-shirt out of the trash

RUSSELL (contd)
Here Take it You LOVE this shirt -
it lets you say everything you want to
say

JEFF
Well it speaks pretty loudly to me

RUSSELL
Its a t-shirt

Russell turns away

JEFF
Im always gonna tell you the truth

RUSSELL
Are you doing coke again

JEFF
Oh yeah All the time

The kid looks down

JEFF (contd)
This is big stuff man From the very
beginning -- we said -- Im the front
man and youre the guitarist with
mystique Thats the dynamic we agreed
on -- Page Plant Mick Keith But
somehow its all turning around We
have got to control whats happening
to us Theres a responsibility here -

RUSSELL
Excuse me but didnt we all get into
this to avoid responsibility

JEFF
Forgive me
(continuing on shirt)
But this is the slow-moving train of
compromise that will kill us

Russell makes a disgusted noise Penny Lane exits discreetly
looking back at William

JEFF (contd)
I cant say anymore with a writer here

RUSSELL
You can trust him you can say whatever
you want

JEFF

(eyes suddenly moist)
I works as hard or harder than anybody
on that stage You know what I do - I
connect I get people off I look
for the guy who isnt getting off and
I make him get off
(beat)
Actually that you can print
(continues to Russell)
And yet why do I always end up feeling
like Im a joke to you I feel nothing
but love for you Were a family

He looks at the t-shirt and starts to cry Embarrassed he
grows angrier

JEFF (contd)

You want to pretend this isnt going

to be a very big band Well it is You
call yourself a leader of this band but
your direction allowed the t-shirt when
you allowed Dick to manage us cause
hes your friend dont you see The
t-shirt is everything Its everything

RUSSELL
Is it my turn Because I think we
should for once say what we really
mean

JEFF
Oh this is the part where you quit -

RUSSELL
(stiffening)
Right Im so predictable

JEFF
No I gotta tell the truth -- I want
you to like me But sometimes I feel
like you collect people who love you
and then very skillfully you make
them feel bad that theyre not good
enough for you

RUSSELL
Stick to singing brother cause you
aint gonna make it as a shrink

JEFF
Deal with it And let me just say
what nobody Else wants to say to you -

RUSSELL
What
JEFF
Your looks have become a problem

makes him nervous

have given him a wide berth He feels silly and they know
it and he hates that they know it which makes him feel
foolish He sits silently William watches him from four
rows back next to Penny She kisses the top of his forehead
a heros welcome He yawns The songs vocal begins There is
only more silence Then after a beat we hear a voice or
two fighting the quiet and singing along Then others
waking up joining in Then Jeff Russell hears them and
starts to sing along too louder now without turning around
Its a voice everyone wants to hear Like it or not this is
his family

98 INT HOTEL BATHROOM -- NIGHT

Penny enters to see William writing in the tub She sits on
the toilet to pee Flustered

WILLIAM
Wait Ill leave

He gets up knocking his carefully organized notes onto the
floor He is brimming with things to say More than he is
even able to communicate

WILLIAM (contd)
You know I think this is going
backwards for me

PENNY
Backwards
WILLIAM
(flustered)

I dont know I just thought we could
hang out maybe do some stuff back

other better and then Id see you

PENNY
Youre one of us Its no big deal
WILLIAM

PENNY

greatest hotel in America Ill

guy Dennis

William stops at the door

WILLIAM
Dont you have any regular friends

PENNY
Famous people are just more interesting

He looks at her Even sitting on the can shes elegant and
totally focused on him

WILLIAM
(carefully)
Well I would be worried that they
were using me And not that anybodys
using you but -

She swoons a little touched and moved

PENNY
Boy if this was the real world and
some guy talked to me like that -

WILLIAM

Let me finish

(continuing)
Im not famous but you could always
use me If anything happens And I
would never use you Even if I got
famous So you know you always have
that from me in the real world If
you ever have to go back there for
anything

She looks at him curiously as the door blasts open Sapphire
and Polexia head for William

Estrella and Polexia kiss each other playfully William looks
confused Across the room Penny laughs turns up the TV

His sexual awakening may be downtime amusement for them but
to him its an embarrassingly intense moment he shares only

unclamps Polexias mouth

102 INT HOTEL HALLWAY -

Circles have sprouted up under Williams eyes The orange bag
strapped over his shoulder he lugs a huge bag of laundry He
consults room list A variety of noises and smells drift from

the band rooms He sees Room Service arrive at Dicks door
and its Estrella who opens the door (Dick in the
background) She smiles sweetly to William -- good morning --

as the door shuts

WILLIAM
Houdini Houdini

He arrives at Russells door Two exclamation points have
been Sharpie-markered to the words Do Not Disturb on the sign
is gaffer-taped to his door He looks through the crack at
the bottom of the door Carefully and politely he knocks
Instantly

RUSSELL (0S)
GO AWAY

Pissed the kid flips off the door He sits down on a chair
directly across from the room Push in on William who is
more pent-up than ever He tries hard not to cry taking
gulps of air as a maid cart swishes past revealing he
failed He cries

Night Doris rocks toward Cleveland on a muggy summer night
The windows of passing houses offer rich Edward Hopper glimpses
of lives and people William will never meet

105 INT WILLIAMS BUS BUNK -

William watches from his bus bunk at the back head on elbow
Looking up he sees the rhythmic motion of bodies on the
mattress above him as music continues

William gets up nods hello to the Roadie and his Date on the
bunk above He moves down the aisle to the seats near the
front A sleeping Russell sits upright hugging his guitar
Penny asleep next to him Polaroid in her hand of Russell

Cleveland

MORNING 107

Russell and band enter like warriors in a pack William sags
with the heavy bags in hand and over his shoulder Here in
the middle of the midwest is an explosive rock mecca just as
promised The feeling of belonging invades all those in this
lobby Fans and other touring rockers mingle together
Outside in the real world everyone else is going to work

FAN
Its Bowie

The lobby ignites as William stands near Penny and Russell
Bowie races from a limousine through the lobby and into the
elevators He is shrouded by a jacket Just the top of his
electric red hair travels the lobby as hes hustled by

security
man Dennis in the elevator And out of the chaos comes

Youve got a great kid -- nothing to

ELAINE
Listen to me Your charm does not
work on me Im onto you Of course

RUSSELL
Yes

ELAINE

He worships you people and thats fine
with you as long as he helps make you
rich

RUSSELL
(a nerve is struck)
Rich I dont think so -

ELAINE
Listen to me Hes a smart good-
hearted 15 year-old kid with infinite
potential

the truth Hes 15

This is not some apron-wearing mother

your world of compromised values and
diminished brain cells that you throw
away like confetti Am I speaking
clearly to you

RUSSELL
Yes maam

ELAINE
If you break his spirit harm him in
any way keep him from his chosen
profession -- which is law Something
you may not value but I do -- you will
meet the voice on the other end of
this telephone And it will not be

pretty Do we understand each other
RUSSELL

Yes yes
ELAINE

(always the teacher)
I didnt ask for this role but Ill

play it Now go do your best Be
bold and mighty forces will come to

She hangs up Russell hangs up oddly affected and shook up

WILLIAM
Some people get her Some dont

Russell is still recovering William feels embarrassed by his
mother once again

111 ON THE HUDDLE

William with the band He yawns as the band breaks
Cleveland
awaits We follow Dick who guides the band onto the stage
platform still in darkness Already stomping and applause
is mounting Russell turns to William before taking the stage
RUSSELL
Your Mom kind of freaked me out

WILLIAM
She means well

Still rattled he takes the stage We see the unbridled
enthusiasm of the faces on the front row A wave of cigarette
lighters stretch out before them

DICK
(importantly)

From Troy Michigan

Russell thwacks a couple chords Audience thunders He turns

to other members feeling chills Its in these moments that
everything else disappears They bow and wave still in
darkness each member seems to have his own fans Dick lets

all this play out before finally adding

DICK (contd)
Would you please welcome to Cleveland

More applause This is very very very very fun

DICK (contd)
Stillwater

Lights come up A full blast of audience love hits them right
in the face as they begin Fever Dog The band charges
headlong into their set as various fans are squeezed up out
of the crowd and onto the stage

HANDHELD ON RUSSELL

Who is in the middle of playing as he smoothly whips off his
guitar and uses the instrument to send a Frenetic fan back
into the crowd He slips back under the strap laughing
More stage climbers spring up where that fan came from and
Russell now watches as Jeff Bebe dodges a fan and comes over
to Russell to lean on him Russell turns to share the moment
with Penny dancing with arms in the air at the side of the
stage

112 INT DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT

William in the dressing room eyes red with exhaustion finally
interviewing Russell He holds the mike stoically

WILLIAM
So when you play a great show like
tonight

Dick enters with great urgency

DICK
Okay I need everybodys attention

The kid shuts his eyes He knew this would happen

DICK (contd)
Alright well the rumors are true
The record company has sent a big-time
manager here to try and talk you into
replacing me His name is Dennis Hope
I know youve all heard of him Hes
got all the big bands Hes right
outside He wants five minutes with
you right now I think we gotta do
it

RUSSELL

(pissed)

Then bring him in

William shuts off his tape recorder

JEFF
(arrogant)
Bring him in Well send him out on a
rail
RUSSELL

(to William)
Well finish on the way to Boston
You can fly home from Boston

William nods exhausted as Dick opens the door In walks a
small general of a man in a baseball t-shirt well-trimmed
beard and bowl cut He holds the super-new Halliburton
briefcase He is DENNIS HOPE 25 A man from the midwest
with a vision of the future of rock and roll Already in his
head are all the things that will come to pass Higher ticket
prices Merchandising deals Greater distribution and
accounting of album sales He shrugs hello to the band

DENNIS HOPE
(completely unthreatening)

RUSSELL
We already have a manager Hes been
with us from the beginning

Hope appreciates the lack of small talk He strides the room
with the joyful enthusiasm of a kid who wants to build a fort
Russell watches dismissive holding his guitar

DENNIS HOPE
Respectfully We all have our roots
I believe in bands holding onto their
roots But those roots need to be
augmented Im gonna tell you the truth
- I may enrage some and enthrall others
I dont really give a fuck Your
manager here needs a manager Example
If you hadnt run out on the contract in
Phoenix you could have sued over
Russells hand but you left negating
the contract forfeiting the deposit
and you effectively traveled a long
way to pay that promoter to
electrocute you

Russell looks at his hand

DENNIS HOPE (contd)
We can all work together Your damages
have put you way into the hole for
this tour Right now you owe the record
company more than youve got But
your records selling theres money
to be made So Ive brought a plane
in we can add more shows to make-up
the difference Respectfully

RUSSELL
(immediately)
We travel by bus

JEFF
Doris is the soul of this band That
bus has been our home since we were
the Jeff Bebe Band

Dick watches his loyal band with admiration

DENNIS
Hey man -- its travel on a pogo stick
if I thought wed make more money
You can play more dates with a plane

112A INT CLEVELAND ARENA - NIGHT - SAME

INTERCUT WITH

112B INT DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT
112B

The band meeting continues

RUSSELL
(passionate)
Hey man its not about the money Its
about Playing music and turning people
on

The band agrees

DENNIS HOPE
(delicately)
Yes of course Clearly
Respectfully But on the distasteful
subject of money Just know Youre
making it -- right now -- and its all --

He gestures to infinity

DENNIS HOPE (contd)
-- out there Im just talking about
bringing it --

Bringing his hand together in a fist he returns it close to
his heart

DENNIS HOPE (contd)
-- back here

The band looks at Dick who manages not to be speechless

DICK
But why should we pay you for something
we can do ourselves

DENNIS HOPE
(immediately)
Do you know how to keep from getting
charged for the ice below the
floorboards of Chicago Stadium
Do you know how to do a headlining
tour do you Claire Rothman at the

LA Forum

Do you know Bobbi Cowan

Lisa Robinson Jim Ladd Frank

Barcelona

(look around amazed)
This is Cleveland Wheres Kid Leo
(basics)
Do you know how you get a record not
pressed but played Do you know I
didnt invent the rainy day man I
just own the best umbrella

He laughs Its fun Band members are now listening

curiously
spellbound

DENNIS HOPE (contd)

Because as much as you may believe that
it will last forever it does not last

forever

your biggest fan right now

soon theyre going to go to college
gonna wanna buy clothes spend that money
some other way and you know what

(the final insult)
Theyll tape your record from a friends

copy

Russell stops fingering his guitar Shot moves across the
faces of the band members Pain

DENNIS HOPE (contd)

Youve got to take what you can when you
can while you can And youve got to do
it now Thats what the big boys do

The band squirms but listens

DENNIS HOPE (contd)

Because if you think Mick Jagger will
still be out there trying to be a rock
star at age fifty youre sadly sadly

mistaken

Now hes reaching them
back at the young dynamo

Their slackened roar-weary faces stare

DICK
(flustered)
Yeah well well think about what
you said

DENNIS HOPE
(casually)
No no You dont understand Ill
think about it Im not auditioning
I came here to decide whether I want
to represent you So Ill stand outside
for a moment and think about whether
I want to stay

He leaves the room with a pleasant shrug Stunned silence
William watches their body language No one wants to talk
first Their faces read as -- who was that guy and how can
we talk him into staying

William watches as Russell reclines Russell grabs Penny and
she falls into the seat next to him We hear the loud
oncoming
sound of the plane in flight as Dennis cooly asks for Pennys
seat
DENNIS HOPE
Do you mind

William trudges the hallway with tape-recorder and notebook
trolling for Russell He passes Boston travelogue posters on
the walls A few room doors are open he looks for any sign

of the guitarist William veers into Dicks room where a
poker game full of Roadies is in progress The room is thick
with exotic smoke They are a bunch of road-hardened snobs
smoking cigars and other items famous to themselves listening
not to rock and roll but Sarah Vaughn

WILLIAM
Anyone seen Russell

DICK

and a roadie named REG from Humble Pie

DICK

Embarrassed Russell notices the kids face He leans over
and speaks confidentially to him

RUSSELL
Look Nobodys feelings are getting
hurt here She already knows Leslies
coming To New York tomorrow They all
understand This is the Circus
Everybodys trying not to go home
Nobodys saying goodbye

WILLIAM
No I got it

RUSSELL

William and Penny sit on opposite ends of a blue locker-room

headed for New York sit by the door The door suddenly opens
and Dick arrives with champagne and a cake decorated with a
slices

cheers

sparkler It is placed in Pennys lap It reads Unforgettable
Penny Age Unknown Boston 1973 They gather now as the
cake sits before a surprised and enchanted Penny Lane

DICK
Happy Birthday from us

William watches her face as she reads the message on the cake
It hasnt sunk in yet

Russell produces a piece of hotel stationery He reads a poem

RUSSELL
So Penny our friend has gained another year
But long ago she threw it in gear
She rocked the south
The East and West
Could you please get off this endless tour
Where were Black Sabbaths fucking
special guest

Laughter

RUSSELL (contd)
She says shes retired
Though weve heard that before
She chose us
And in Penny Lane we trust
She is a fan of this band
Much more so than us

William watches her face Still enchanted she hands out
of the cake

DENNIS HOPE
(to the point)
Sorry the plane isnt bigger

It hits her She looks at William for a clue His truthful
face does not look away Now she knows She turns to the
others -- the plane isnt bigger Shot moves in on Penny as
she blinks just a little cutting into the cake still mugging
for everybody covering it all with a layer of sweet giddy
laughter Shot comes to rest behind her her head turning to
connect with band members Each of them look away nobody
maintaining eye contact with her except the one she now doesnt
look at William She blows out the candles vamping Marilyn
Monroe-style and sucks off the frosting seductively to

Russell watches as we push in on Penny She notices all the

So it wasnt a birthday party it was

William doesnt answer He looks at her blowing some hair
out of her face

PENNY (contd)

WILLIAM

PENNY

(concerned for him)

He shakes his head Its so beyond a test

PENNY (contd)
I know Im not on the plane and Im
not going on some other bands bus I

If you could find out from Russell --

WILLIAM
(quietly)

PENNY

Williams eyebrows rise She examines his face for clues

WILLIAM

She tears some leaves off a tree He looks at her unable to
formulate a response

PENNY
(accusatory)
Im sorry I told you so much You
have some way of making everybody tell
you all their secrets

WILLIAM

Thats a good one Tell me too much
and make it my fault

He continues walking she follows They have ventured outside
the backstage area onto adjoining Boston farmland The show
booms in the background

PENNY
Come on Youve seen whats happened
Russell and I fell in love How much
I dont know but this is the first
time Ive fallen for someone really

about it

WILLIAM

WILLIAM (contd)

(sputtering)
Why dont you just tell me now who

store I know who to be jealous of
Because right now its looking like
the whole store

Hes upset She stares at him

PENNY
(teasing defiant)
Youll remember me forever I was

WILLIAM
(upset at the memory)
So was Steely Dan It was a crowded

She laughs cant help it Then

PENNY
You make me laugh I think Im gonna

two very young kids thrashed by the seas of rock and roll

His frustration increases She just doesnt get it Applause

PENNY

PENNY

(baring her soul)
When I was 14 my Mom and her boyfriend
took me to a Rolling Stones concert -
and I freaked out and I rushed up to
the front of the stage and then a
thousand people had the same idea at
the same time and I was getting crushed
And I couldnt breathe and that thought
flashed through me - almost like a car
accident - I thought I might die And
it was in the middle of Midnight
Rambler and Keith Richards saw me
And he came over and came to the front
of the stage and he pulled me out
And they took me backstage and they
gave me coke with ice and a - anda
lemon And I never went home

WILLIAM
What about your Mom

PENNY
She always said - Marry Up Marry

me Lady

at our table for had to be an hour
right Just Rapping Bob Dylan I
kept looking for you I was going to

WILLIAM
Its a log story

A sharp jolt of turbulence Russell begins pounding on the
card table in rhythm
RUSSELL
(singing Buddy Holly)

Peggy Sure Peggy Sue
DICK

RUSSELL
Pretty pretty pretty pretty Peggy
Sue

A moment of laughter and then bam Jeffs drink rises and
suspends briefly in mid-air The plane takes another mighty
knock

JEFF
We shouldnt be here

RUSSELL
Doris we miss you

Fear is creeping in around the edges William already an
uneasy flier looks down

PILOTS VOICE
This is Craig your pilot It appears
weve caught the edge of that electrical
storm we were trying to outrun Buckle
up tight now Were gonna do our best
to getcha out of this

The rocking of the plane worsens as all buckle up

JEFF
Electrical storm

RUSSELL
(strapping in for a roller
coaster)
Rock and roll

The sky darkens abruptly William looks up increasingly
nervous stares straight ahead The plane suddenly drops and
stabilizes Everyone is silent but Russell

RUSSELL (contd)
Wooooo00o Baby

A moment later an ashen-faced CO-PILOT emerges balancing
himself with hands on the ceiling of the shuddering plane

CO-PILOT
Were gonna try to land in Tupelo
Were going to have to cut the inside
lighting for the next several minutes
We found a field to land in

The kid notices Silent Ed is rubbing a small crucifix

DENNIS HOPE
A field

JEFF
I cant breathe

Push in on Russell We hear a series of unfamiliar electrical
sounds The plane screwballs through the sky

CO-PILOT

It might be a rough set-down We should
be fine

(cracking at the edges)
But what we do say in a situation like
this is - We would pass but before the
plane disassembled However God
help us if theres anything you want
to say to each other any secrets
anything like that now would be a
good time But just hang in there
Well get you out of this

He returns to the cockpit The weather worsens as the hail
suddenly pelts the plane and it comes down hard Inside

lights
shut off William stares straight ahead as the cockpit door
swings open - total chaos visible inside - and then shuts
again
DICK
And everyone thinks its so glamorous
out here
LARRY

(oddly detached)
He just told us were gonna die

JEFF
(insecurities running wild)

Were gonna crash in Elvis hometown --

RUSSELL
Shut up

JEFF
-- we cant even die in an original
city

RUSSELL
Cmon Dennis get us a better city

Nervous laughter Another sheet of hail hits the plane

LESLIE
Oh my God
PUSH IN ON WILLIAM
Just shaking Nearly in tears Hyperventilating
RUSSELL

If something should happen I love
all of you I dont think we have to
do the secrets thing

The plane shakes Now lightening strikes very close A
flashing wall of electricity rolls through the plane and
evaporates with a burning smell still in the air In the
darkness

DENNIS HOPE
I once hit a man in Dearborn Michigan
A hit-and-run I hit him and kept on
going I dont know if hes alive or
dead but Im sorry

LESLIE
(gripped with fear)
Oh my God
The plane wildly rises and falls It stops for a moment
strange smooth patch
DICK

love you all too and youre my
family Especially since Marna left
me But if I ever took an extra dollar
or two here and there it was because
knew Id earned it

RUSSELL
slept with Marna Dick

JEFF

LARRY
I waited until you broke up with her
But me too

JEFF
I also slept with Leslie when you
were fighting

RUSSELL
You slept with Jeff

LESLIE
Yes but it didnt count It was the
summer we decided to be free of all
rules

RUSSELL
(to Jeff)
And you say you love me

JEFF
(the truth)
I dont love you man I never did

RUSSELL
Please Enough

JEFF
NONE of us love you You act above

LARRY
Finally The truth

JEFF
You just held it over us like you
light leave like were lucky to be

with you And we had to live with it
I had to live with you and now I might
die with you and its not fucking fair

William watches catatonic

RUSSELL
(to Larry and Ed)
You hate me You too

Larry stares at him Ed says nothing

RUSSELL (contd)
All this love All this loyalty
(incredulous giddy)
And you dont even like me
JEFF
And Im still in love with you Leslie

Bam The plane is pulling sideways and dropping altitude

LESLIE
I dont want to hear anymore Shut
up Shut up Shut up

RUSSELL
(to Jeff)
Whatever happens youre dead

JEFF
Dont be self-righteous Russell not
now You were sleeping with Penny
that groupie Last summer and up
until yesterday Why dont you tell
Leslie THAT

Russell tries to get up and attack him The force keeps him
in his seat He yells Loud

DENNIS
(freaking out)
quit

The turbulence worsens William finds his mouth saying
emotional words he cannot control

WILLIAM
That groupie She was a Band-Aid
All she did was love your band And
you all -- you used her all of you
You used her and threw her away She
almost died last night while you were
with Bob Dylan Youre always talking
about the fans the fans the fans
She was your biggest fan and you threw
her away And if you cant see that
thats your biggest problem

Russell and Jeff stare at each other The plane is rocking
very very hard Leslie is crying

ED

They all turn to the silent drummer (Its his first spoken
dialogue of the movie)

DAY

Then

The plane pops out from below the clouds Sunshine spikes
through the embattled windows of the plane as they float
downwards to the city of Tupelo Mississippi A very very
uneasy silence fills the plane No one can look at each other
Out bursts the Co-Pilot giddy with victory

CO-PILOT
Thank God above WERE ALIVE WERE
ALIVE WERE GONNA MAKE IT

Shot of all the occupants ending with Russell Suddenly the
alternative seems far more attractive We hear Rod Stewarts
Jos Lament as music plays over their still-shocked faces

148 INT TUPELO AIRPORT CORRIDOR -- DAY

Music continues as they walk together like ghosts in a long
and very pregnant silence ignoring the kid Everything is
different now The kid peels off and throws up in a dumpster
We continue with the band unhappily moving forward William
hustles back to catch up They ignore him There are much
bigger thoughts in play No one wants to speak

JEFF
Well think we can build on this new
honesty

Boom Russell attacks him and theyre pulled apart The
band continues moving forward arriving at a fork in the

terminals William stops This is where he must part company
He stands at the mouth of the next terminal as the band
continues unaware hes split off He watches their backs
theyve forgotten him

Then Russell turns sensing something missing William All
now stop and turn Still shell-shocked they summon a pre-

occupied but heartfelt goodbye William waves Music
continues

LESTER BANGS
Thats because we are uncool And

Good-looking people have no spine
Their art never lasts They get the
girls but were smarter

WILLIAM
I can really see that now

LESTER BANGS
Yeah great art is about conflict and
pain and guilt and longing and love
disguised as sex and sex disguised as
love and lets face it you gota
big head start

WILLIAM
Im glad you were home

LESTER BANGS

WILLIAM
Me too

way we really are

JEFF
He was supposed to be our friend

RUSSELL
(ruefully remembering)
I told him to write what he wanted
All eyes look to Russell

TONY
(to Russell)
By the way he has you on acid
screaming I Am A Golden God from a
fans rooftop

RUSSELL
(immediately remembering)
Oh my God
JEFF

They used him to fuck us

RUSSELL
(still back at Golden
God)
I didnt say Golden God Or did I

DICK
We never took him seriously and now
its serious

RUSSELL
I liked him as a person

JEFF
He was never a person He was a
journalist

Russell nods He looks at Silent Ed drumming soundlessly on
a rubber pad

RUSSELL
You You had the right idea all along

Ed silently nods thanks

DENNIS HOPE
(nervously)
How about the plane flight

DICK
Its all in there But dont worry
its all unspecific who say what No
names are mentioned in the more
embarrassing sequences its just
completely obvious whos who Were

DAY

Silence

RUSSELL
I forgot he was there

DENNIS HOPE
Well they havent talked to Russell -

the fact checker Then they cant
print it

JEFF
(brightening)

DENNIS HOPE
Its war my friend If youd met me
earlier he would have never been on the
around

Dennis hands Russell the phone

DENNIS HOPE (contd)

Everyone looks at William
Their congratulations stop on a dime

(darkly)
Crazy

FACT CHECKER
(one last shot to William)
Were going with the Who -

The kid has been sandbagged The machine of a big-time
magazine

whirs into action on another story as the cluster moves down

the hall

SOMEONES VOICE
Hes just some fan what did you
expect

William sits there as only David Felton stay behind
brandishing his cigarette-holder He sits down next to the
kid

FELTON
Well I believe you

He looks at the kid decides to offer a personal parable

FELTON (contd)

Jim Morrison once came to my house and
drank a beer The beer is still on my
mantle Im 35 years old with Jim
Morrisons beer as a shrine I wanted
to be Earnest Hemingway Instead I
have Jim Morrisons beer

(shrugs hes learned to
live with it)
If you didnt make your story up good
for you If you did make it up good
for you

The kid looks at him too tired and still in shock

FELTON (contd)
Say something so I know youre alive

WILLIAM
Goodbye

He exits

FELTON

157 INT BACKSTAGE CREW MEAL -
NIGHT 157

Russell Hammond sits down on a plastic chair with a paper-plate
filled with buffet-style food - steak and baked potato
Preoccupied and several seats away from other crew members

He drinks a glass of milk Out old friend Sapphire takes the
seat next to him holding a skimpy paper plate of vegetables

RUSSELL
I feel bad

SAPPHIRE
Well at least you feel That puts
you in a higher class of asshole

They eat in silence Sapphire looks around The new breed of
groupies eye her as they cruise Russell on the periphery
Theyre bolder flashier She eyes them back with seniority

RUSSELL
What did I do

SAPPHIRE
Well - you can do what the big boys
do
(he looks at her)
Nothing
RUSSELL
Yeah

The girls still circle Russell nearby Hes unaware

SAPPHIRE
You believe these new girls None of
em take birth control and they eat
all the steak

She looks sadly at her plate of vegetables An ever-sharp
mind in last nights clothes she commands Russells respect

SAPPHIRE (contd)
They dont even know what it id to be
a fan To blindly love some silly
piece of music or some band so much
that it hurts please theyre all
just after the money Shoo --

(in their direction)

Go rob a bank Its more honest
RUSSELL
Is Penny okay

SAPPHIRE

The Quaalude Incident Yeah it wasnt
pretty She could have died I always
warned her about letting too many guys
fall in love with her I guess I was
wrong

(shrugs)
On of em saved her life

Russell nods

RUSSELL
Well its finally over with Leslie
Im going to call her

SAPPHIRE

Let her retire

(he doesnt respond)
You want to lock her up in a house in
Michigan Please

(he doesnt respond)
Write her a song someday She deserves
it Something about that girl brought
out the best in a lot of

(looks around backstage)

pretty average people She deserves

it

Russell stares into his crew meal nodding a little

SAPPHIRE (contd)
(forward thinking)
because something tells me twenty
years from now well remember her
and not much else

Russell smiles to himself knows its true Dick passes
placing hands on Russells shoulders massaging a little

DICK
Have a good vacation I hope the band
stays together Before it all went
down the shitter it was starting to
get really good

Dick claps Russell on the back and moves on He turns to
Sapphire

RUSSELL
Im not going to blame myself I do
make people happy They just shouldnt
get to know me cause it appears to
spoil everything

SAPPHIRE
Dont be so easy on yourself

RUSSELL
What gives you the right to get this
personal with me

SAPPHIRE
Lets not reminisce

158 INT SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT -- NIGHT

William moves

like a zombie through the airport and collapses

in a seat He sits still in the crowded flow of human traffic
A cluster of Flight Attendants pass One stops a stylish

young
woman wearing
colors

a tall bubble-shaped PSA hat with swirling

ANITA
William

He looks at her He feels like hes on Mars and she looks
like a Martian

William looks

William whistles the family whistle Sister and brother trudge
up the steps

ANITA
This is not my idea of a good time

WILLIAM
Just get me to my bed

ANITA
(resigned)
Ill deal with her

William whistles again Mom meets them at the door She looks
at her trashed son who has finally come home For the first
time she hugs Anita first and its not lost on Anita

Its a clumsy neck-hug neither wanting to commit The kid
passes to his Mothers left with suitcase intentionally
nudging her into his sister Anita takes this as an aggressive
act of love and hugs her mother back Tears stream down Moms
face Their cheeks touch Mom pulls away and sees her own
tears on Anitas face Thinking that shes also crying she
grabs a tissue for them both

160 INT ELAINES HOUSE --
CONTINUOUS 160

The kid stands in the hallway listening shaking his head
poised to enter his room unseen by them

ANITA
(so worried)
What are we going to do about him
His

center

DAY

ELAINE
I dont know Whatever happened to him I
just wish it could have happened to me

ANITA
The magazine killed his story

Now they really hug Anita gulping back real tears William
watches them bonding over the oddest thing - his failure
William goes into the bedroom the final three feet to sleep
and shuts the door A hand places a hotel sign on the door -
DO NOT DISTURB Slight push in

ON BED
He collapses with all his clothes on almost instantly asleep

walls just as he left them boast a pantheon of rock heroes
with a very lonely Abraham Lincoln (or Atticus Finch) in the

161 INT ROLLING STONE OFFICES --

The elevator doors ding open and out walks Russell Hammond
The Secretary has just finished answering the phone Straight
Arrow Publishers She puts the caller on hold

RUSSELL
Hi Im Russel Hammond

SECRETARY
Youre here regarding

RUSSELL
My life

162 INT EDITORIAL OFFICE - DAY

Russell stands with the editors observing the fine portraits
on the walls Hes behind enemy lines and he knows it
Everything in the room fascinates him

RUSSELL
I dont care what happens I dont
care if you put us on the cover But
you sent us a kid and and he was a
fan And we all made friends with
him - absolutely to get a good story
But then we actually liked him We
thought hes show us our lives in
some mythic way and I guess were
not mythic We panicked

JANN
You denied most of the story

RUSSELL
Yeah well heres the problem with
the truth Its too true -

BEN
Well we appreciate the visit The
last time an artist came here it was
Buddy Miles and he punched me

RUSSELL
Im not punching anybody I am
personally as of 2 pm yesterday ona
voyage of self-reinvention This is
about William Miller

(counting off fingers)

He lives with us he lost his virginity
he saw us at our worst appreciated
our best he saved two lives including

mine he smuggled about a half-pound
of pot into Boston and we never even
told him -

Nearby David Felton looks at another editor raising an
eyebrow

RUSSELL (contd)
-- we told him too much we told him

everything He almost died with us
over Tupelo if the band survives
him itll be a miracle but you

know he tried to keep up and thats
a journalist to me

JANN
Its too late Were going with a
different cover

RUSSELL
(immediately)
Thank God

But Russell looks around at the numerous portraits if dead

legendary rock stars fixing on the one photo closest to all of

them a very vulnerable-looking Janis Joplin A second
thought
RUSSELL (contd)
You tell me its too late But I could
go back to my hotel room and and
OD tonight and something tells me
youd find a way to put me on the cover
of the next issue Am I right

He looks at their faces They cannot disagree

RUSSELL (contd)
Im learning the game
(beat shrug)
We fucked up We made friends with him

BEN
Next time well all be more
professional

RUSSELL
Maybe so

(beat an odd thought)
But God forbid the day comes when
selling yourself is as important as
the music you make

(rueful to Hendrix on the
wall)
You might have died at the right time
my friend

JANN
Thank you for visiting Good luck

RUSSELL
Do what you want but the story is
true

LONG SHOT RUSSELL
at the entrance Raises his hand

RUSSELL (contd)
Good evening

162A EXT SAN FRANCISCO -
DAY 162A

Russell stands outside a traveling man with no where to go
Oddly and in a way that surprises him the world begins to
speak to him again little noises everywhere turning into a
music of its own Its a beautiful and compelling silence
He thrusts his hands deep in his pockets and takes a breath
of life His head filling again with the music of the world
he begins to walk down the street Very naturally and quite
randomly he is noticed by young passersby They cant help
it He looks like a star They cant quite figure out who it
is but its someone and they begin to follow him down the
street Unbeknownst to him as he walks along deep in
thought
a small crowd begins to form following him

163 INT BREAKFAST TABLE - DAY

A quiet kitchen Anita has been cooking A substantial
breakfast has been placed on the table Sausage orange
juice and now Anita sets down a plate of pancakes with
syrup and butter in front of her mother William watches his
mother facing an old enemy - white sugar

ANITA
Theyre called pancakes Who knows
when well be together again Splurge
Its what most people call breakfast

Mom looks at her children and takes a breath

ELAINE
I went through your records And I
found a song to play for you

She goes to the stereo and puts on a record The two children
eye each other - whats coming next (Song to be chosen)

The two kids eye each other again Self-consciously avoiding
their gaze Mom sits and toys with her breakfast Its a song
she clearly wants them to hear Its a song from the heart
They look at her amazed Elaine looks up regards her family
Somehow theyre back at this table They continue eating
breakfast

164 ON SIDEWALK

Bam A bundle of bound Rolling Stone Magazines lands on the
newsstand pavement with a thud Someone reaches in to cut the
cord as the magazines puff up into view Its the new issue
with Russell Hammond on the cover The title Stillwater Runs
Deep Just another stack of magazines waiting to be places in
the racks

FADE OUT

Music segues to Led Zeppelins Four Sticks Penny Lanes
sleeping Polaroid shots of our characters featuring a few
self-portraits
