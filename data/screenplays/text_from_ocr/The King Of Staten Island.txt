INT OSCARS BASEMENT - NIGHT

Scott and his friends OSCAR IGOR RICHIE KELSEY and TARA
are in Oscar’s basement watching The Purge and smoking weed

IGOR
I love this movie They shot this
on Staten Island

KELSEY
This movie makes no sense Why
would the government make a purge

legal

SCOTT
Clearly to let them blow off some
steam

KELSEY

That’s why you go to the spa

TARA
Or the therapist

KELSEY
Or get your nails done

SCOTT
Or murder some folks

KELSEY
Come on I brought Tara over so we
could get out of this basement
Let’s go out Let’s go dancing

TARA
I love dancing

KELSEY
Let’s do something
ScoTT
We don’t go out

OSCAR
We don’t dance

RICHIE
The Purge is not enough for you

TARA
Does anybody else like dancing

KELSEY
Yes me I love dancing

IGOR
I like it

TARA
You do

KELSEY
Yes He’s a really good dancer

TARA
What’s your favorite move

IGOR

It’s kind of like a shake
KELSEY

A shake
IGOR

I don’t know I just do whatever
the music tells me to do

OSCAR
There’s nothing but douchebags at
these clubs

SCOTT
I love it here man It’s safe

KELSEY

You just sit here all day and smoke

weed and jerk each other off

SCOTT
That sounds amazing

OSCAR
I’ve never been jerked off by any
of my friends
SCOTT
Me neither

TARA
(to Oscar)
I like your tattoos

OSCAR

I knew you would right
KELSEY

Don’t talk to him He has

Chlamydia
OSCAR

I had Had Chlamydia
TARA

It’s curable
OSCAR

(to Kelsey)

And you introduced me to the girl
that gave me Chlamydia so you
basically gave me Chlamydia

SCOTT
You assisted the Chlamydia

KELSEY
He doesn’t have insurance He can’t
get the meds

SCOTT

I actually did some of those
TARA

You did
OSCAR

You know I gotta rep the Island
Staten Island

TARA

Tara clocks a tattoo of a date on Scott’s arm

TARA
What is that date
SCOTT
Oh That’s the date my dad died
TARA
Oh my god Your dad died I’m so
sorry
SCOTT
Don’t be It’s fine It’s totally
cool
TARA

So what happened

KELSEY
You don’t need to ask Don’t ask
that It’s kind of inappropriate

Scott plays it off

SCOTT
He was a fireman He died in a
fire

TARA
Oh my god

KELSEY

Yeah we knew

OSCAR
We don’t like to talk about it
That’s why we don’t bring it up
Apologize to Scott

KELSEY
It’s the right thing to do You
should say sorry It’s not okay

OSCAR
Apologize or get out

TARA
Scott I wanted to say I’m really
sorry I asked about your tattoo
Everyone but Tara bursts into laughter

TARA
What

KELSEY
He doesn’t care It’s fine Look at
him He’s laughing so much

SCOTT
I don’t care

OSCAR
We talk about his dead dad all the
time Knock knock

SCOTT
Who’s there

OSCAR
Not your dad

KELSEY
We make so many jokes about it

Scott laughs crazily Igor leans over to hug him

SCOTT
I don’t even miss him at all

Laughter dies down Scott nods at Kelsey and she nods back

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Scott and Kelsey are having sex

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
Scott and Kelsey now sit in bed

SCOTT
Did you cum

KELSEY
Yes were you there I did Like
six times

SCOTT
Awesome

KELSEY
It was great Did you
SCOTT
No but it’s okay I had fun I had
fun back there

KELSEY
I feel bad that you never do

SCOTT
No I do all the time I just don’t
put on a Broadway show like you do
I’m more quiet I’m more like
Charlie Chaplin when I cum

KELSEY
Like a silent movie Do you think
it’s the antidepressants

SCOTT
For sure If I didn’t have the
antidepressants I’d come in like
eight seconds and then you wouldn’t
cum and then you’d be depressed and
then you would have to take
antidepressants

KELSEY
Can I say something I just still
don’t understand why this is such a
big secret

SCOTT
You know why It’s special It’s
our thing It wouldn’t be special
if everybody knew about it

KELSEY

But I don’t just want to do this
SCOTT

I totally get that So should we

stop

Scott gets out of bed begins to dress

KELSEY
No I don’t know Like what is
this

SCOTT
This

KELSEY

I want to do what normal people do
SCOTT
It might be weird We’ve known each
other forever Since fourth grade
It would be like incest

KELSEY
No it wouldn’t

SCOTT
We’re best pals and I wouldn’t want
to jeopardize our friendship or
something like that over something--
not silly but it’s just a big risk

KELSEY
But we’ve already done the deed
What else is there

SCOTT
Done the deed

KELSEY
I don’t know

SCOTT
You deserve somebody way better
than me

KELSEY
You’re a good guy I like you

SCOTT
Based on what I mean I like you
too It’s just-- can I tell you
something but can you not tell
anybody People probably know But
there’s something wrong with me
Like mentally I’m not okay up
there I get all manic and crazy
and I make really insane impulsive
decisions And I’m scared of myself
and I don’t want to scare you or me
or hurt anyone So I think it would
just be best and really responsible
of me if I just backed off

KELSEY
I don’t want you to feel like that
about yourself

SCOTT
I just don’t want to offend you
Youre the best I think you’re the
greatest
KELSEY
I know you think I’m great I’m
awesome I feel bad that you don’t
think you’re great

MARGIE
Scott your cousin’s offering you a
job Consider it okay

JOE
If you’re good at it you can become

Your dark sense of humor doesn’t
work for me

Claire is packing She calls Scott into her room

CLAIRE
Sit down

She hands Scott a gift which he opens

SCOTT
What is this
CLAIRE
It’s paint brushes and some paint
I know you’re into art so I thought
you could expand your horizons
while I’m gone

SCOTT
You got a gift receipt for this

CLAIRE
Are you okay

SCOTT
Fine What do you mean

CLAIRE
You gonna be okay without me here

SCOTT
What you don’t think I can survive
here without you

CLAIRE
Just don’t be a dick okay Be nice
to Mom Don’t give her a hard time
She deserves a break

SCOTT
I always give her a break When am
I gonna get my break

CLAIRE
What’re you talking about All
anyone ever does is worry about
you I was ignored my entire
childhood because of you

SCOTT
I forgot that my childhood was so
dandy

CLAIRE
You don’t get to act crazy your
whole life just because dad died
At least you got to know him

SCOTT
Well you’re lucky you didn’t get to
know him because that’s why you’re
almost normal If you got to know
him you would’ve known that he was
the coolest guy ever and that
would’ve ruined the rest of your
life

CLAIRE
But what are you gonna do Are you
gonna get a job or are you gonna
leave the house

SCOTT
I’m gonna open that tattoo
restaurant

CLAIRE
No Like for real

SCOTT
I am being real It’s never been
done before I looked it up I
Googled it It’s never been done
not even as a joke

CLAIRE
Because no one wants to go to a
restaurant and watch people get
tattooed while they eat It’s
gross

SCOTT
It’s the best idea ever Ruby
Tattoosdays where everyone’s
welcome Chicken and tattoos

CLAIRE
That’s not a business You gotta
get your shit together Time is
passing by very quickly

SCOTT
That’s why I smoke weed all the
time okay It slows it all down

CLAIRE
I’m worried about you

SCOTT
Why now You never gave a shit You
literally never cared until this
second Like what gives You never
looked out for me once

CLAIRE
You’re my older brother You’re
supposed to look out for me

SCOTT
Youre just guilty because you’re
leaving Now all of a sudden you’re

afraid I’m gonna die I was gonna
die anyway whether you stay or not

CLAIRE
Are you gonna hurt yourself

SCOTT
Probably Yeah I don’t know how
but if anybody could do it it’s
me

Claire busies herself upset

CLAIRE
This is why I don’t talk to you
The one thing I know is you’re not
gonna listen to my advice

SCOTT
Why would I You don’t even give a
shit You’re leaving You’re not
part of the family

CLAIRE
I’m the only normal person in this
family Every second I’m away from
you I’m worrying about you That’s
what you do to people

SCOTT
You should be worried

CLAIRE
Don’t ruin college for me okay
Go

SCOTT
Fine You should bring that chipper
personality to college Guys will
love it

Half the time you’re not even
putting out fires You’re just
jerking off watching Scarface

RAY
Take it easy man

SCOTT
I’m just saying And it’s wrong to
tell a kid that you’re gonna be
there for him for his whole entire
life You miss graduation your
birthdays my prom dances That’s a
very mean thing to do to children
And if you have a family you’re an
asshole for being a fireman

MONTY
That’s one way to look at it

SCOTT
Tell that to my dad Oh but you
can’t Because he’s dead Anybody
got a good response to that

I need to talk to you about
something I was thinking that it’s
time to think about getting your
own apartment

SCOTT
What Why would you say that

MARGIE
You are so awesome and I think I’ve
been there for you too much
Sometimes in life the thing that’s
motivating is when people don’t
have that safety net

SCOTT
Right but I need that safety net
because I don’t have my shit
together Why are you doing this
Is this because of him

MARGIE
No it’s just you’re twenty-four
years old now

RAY
Phelps had a fistful of gold medals
by twenty-four

perspective Wayne Gretzky had like
96 goals when he was twenty-four
Roger Staubach graduated West
Point won a Heisman Trophy fought
in the Vietnam War and then joined
the Cowboys by the time he was
twenty-four

SCOTT
I don’t know who that is Who gives
a fuck

apartment by summer

the house

good way We think you can do great
things

MARGIE

Be that as it may until you leave
which is gonna be good for you and
it’s gonna be motivating you’re
gonna have to pull your weight a
little more around here And one
thing we thought would help you
contribute and wouldn’t be hard to
do is to help Ray bring his kids
back and forth to school when he
can’t do it because of work

RAY

We didn’t want to insult you
because you seem a little delicate

SCOTT
No please what was he like

PAPA
He was kind of like you If you
didn’t know him you’d think he was
a crack baby But he was a good
guy He was a great guy

MONTY
I heard he was fucking hilarious

PAPA
He got away with so much shit
because he was so freaking likable

SCOTT
What kind of stuff

PAPA
One time we were driving down the
West Side Highway after being out
all night You know this

MONTY
This is a good one

PAPA
And he’s through the sunroof He’s
like sitting on top of the car We
couldn’t get him in so we start
speeding up stopping short By the
time we hit the bridge he fell onto
the windshield so he’s hanging on
cursing at us putting his face up
against the windshield He’s like
“You motherfuckers” It was some
real Tom Cruise shit So we get
into Brooklyn and sure enough
there’s cops Like they were
waiting for us

SCOTT
Oh shit

PAPA
So now I’m like “Oh fuck we’re
screwed” Stan gets off the car He
goes over to the cop I’m thinking
“Shit he’s gonna fucking clock this
cop” and he goes right up to him
grabs his face and kisses him on
the lips They went to fucking high
school together Only Stan could
get away with that I swear to God

The rumor is that he got the coke
from the cops

understand the pressure I’m under
thinking this guy’s perfect

time I mean we all did it

RAY

RAY
How do you think he stayed this
skinny all these years

PAPA
I have a high metabolism

RAY
They should have his face on a
nickel in Bolivia

PAPA
Playtime was playtime When he was
at work he was all business And he
was the guy you wanted by your side
if you were going into a fire If
they were gonna build a fireman
from scratch he would’ve been

JOHN
Prototype

PAPA
Top to bottom he’s a fireman

MONTY
As brave as they come

Papa turns to Scott serious

PAPA
You know I was thinking about what
you said at the game about how
firemen shouldn’t have kids Let me
tell you something You know your
dad he didn’t just die saving
those two people that night He did
that a lot Like sometimes he
wouldn’t even wait for the line
He’d just go in a fully evolved
room And you’re like what are you
doing Because if he heard there
was somebody in there he’d just go
in That’s who he was That’s how
he was built He couldn’t not be
that way You understand

Scott avoids eye contact but nods

SCOTT
Thank you Thank you for sharing
That’s awesome

PAPA
He would slap the shit out of me if
he heard me say this about him but
he was a hero And heroes are
necessary And they should be
allowed to have families But I
know it means that people suffer
And I’m sorry I’m sorry

SCOTT
Well I’m sorry for being a dick
There’s two sides to every story
Thank you for sharing with me
Thanks for taking me here

INT MARGIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

SCOTT
I hung out with Ray and the guys
from the firehouse the other night
at the bar and they were telling
all these stories about Dad and
they were stories I never heard of
before about him like doing coke
and being hilarious

Margie chooses her words carefully

MARGIE
Well he was hilarious He was also
out of control and crazy

SCOTT
Why didn’t you tell me

MARGIE
I don’t know I just wanted you to
have some good memories to offset
what happened I didn’t know what
to say Was I gonna say “Your dad
loved watching cartoons with you
because he was tripping all the
time

ScoTT
Sounds like a good dad to me

Margie gives a half-smile

SCOTT
No you know what I get it
Knowing he had his issues and

Scott and Margie are watching Game of Thrones in the dark

problems just like everybody else
it makes me feel better It really
humanizes him

MARGIE
Well he was a great guy He was a
very complicated guy but he had a
really big heart

SCOTT
Like Ray

Margie considers this

MARGIE
I guess like Ray

SCOTT
I guess you could say that you have
a type

MARGIE
I have a type

They go back to watching TV

SCOTT
I know we don’t really talk about
it much but I miss Dad A lot

Margie is moved

MARGIE
Yeah Me too

SCOTT

And I’m sorry that I’ve been so
difficult to deal with I’1l try
and get it together It’s just
hard I think it’1ll always be hard

I really like Ray but he’s gotta
lose that mustache When we go out
in public people think that I’m
kidnapped People look at me like
“Are you okay” And I’m like “Yeah

Margie laughs hard
