A light rain and crickets CHIRPING Somewhere in the
DANCE MUSIC is blaring but here its only a whisper with
beat

Water trickles out of a jagged pipe Splashing up mud
riverlet weaves through hamburger wrappers and

beer cans spent condoms and an old Spin magazine

The tiny stream ripples past glass and trash and the body
woman Face up breathing Dead grass caught in her

Her name is RONNA MARTIN Shes eighteen and bleeding

Bleeding a lot

She tries to push herself up but the dirt around
Her legs are useless Despite it all theres a
perverse joy to her face like shes just

remembered the

punchline to a favorite joke

Brit with surfer hair He looks around realizes where he

Panicked he starts POUNDING and KICKING

You shake it you weigh it and youre
totally convinced you have it pegged

overpay for quarters if it makes you feel
all warm and happy But this is my deal
so just sit back and watch

Mannie and Claire remain unconvinced Ronna reaches for the
keys CRANKING the ignition even though Mannies driving The
ENGINE purrs

RONNA (CONT d)
Besides Todd likes me This wont be any
problem

A BUZZER sounds

12 EXT DOORSTEP - NIGHT

Ronna stands by the intercom of a two-story walkup in
Hollywood Waiting she looks back to the street where The

Three out of four lights are burned out in the hallway
A few feet ahead of Ronna a door stands partly ajar A weird
red-and-green light spills out through the crack along with
an Alice in Chains SONG
14 INT APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Ronna pushes the door open from the hallway

RONNA
Todd

Shades drawn the room is completely insulated from reality
The light bulbs have been markered over casting eerie pools of
red and green light Broken CDs dangle off a tiny Christmas
tree by the stereo Slacker seasonalism

GAINES (0S)
Dont let the cat out
Ronna closes the door behind her

TODD GAINES emerges from the darkened bedroom tying the
string on a pair of sweat pants Thats all hes wearing

RONNA
I didnt wake you up did I

GAINES
Nah

He settles into an overstuffed couch and lights a Marlboro
Adjusts himself in the crotch Motions for her to take a
chair Shes more nervous than she wants to let on

GAINES
I thought you were still buying quarters
off Simon Least what Simon pretends are
quarters

RONNA
I keep him honest

GAINES
At that level youre supposed to pinch
Its the economics of it

GO 82698 Revisions

IN THE BACKGROUND

A WOMAN with a ballerinas body comes out of the bedroom She
tucks an unrealistically large breast down into her tight top

GAINES
You leaving

She leans over the back of the sofa for quick tonguey kiss
In a sneak attack she shoves a Santas hat down to his ears
He bats the white pom out of his eyes
GAINES
Be good

The woman is out the door without a word Gaines looks back
over at Ronna not the least bit self-conscious about the hat

GAINES
I take it this is not a social call

RONNA
I need a favor

GAINES

A favor Wow I didnt know we were such
good friends Ronna Because if we were
you would know I give head before I give
favors I dont even give my best friends
head so the chance of your getting a
favor right now are pretty fucking slim

(beat)
You might try just telling me what you
want to buy

RONNA
Twenty hits of ecstacy

He takes a deep drag on the cigarette looking at her Blows
the smoke out He picks up a remote control Aims it at the
stereo

CLOSE UP

The volume meter climbing fast
Out of the green into the red
The MUSIC is deafening

ON GAINES

On top of Ronna face in her ear His hand wraps around her
head holding her tight We cant HEAR what hes saying
Ronnas eyes betray her fear

GO 82698 Revisions

14 He backs off She looks confused
He nods Do it

The MUSIC still BLARING she stands and slowly unbuttons her
shirt Takes it off -- very self-consciously Pulls her t-
shirt off over her head Just her bra underneath He motions
for her to turn around She does then back

Her hands are shaking She holds them together
Gaines aims the remote at the stereo The MUSIC retreats

GAINES
You come here out of the blue asking for
twenty hits Just so happens twenty is
the magic number where intent to sell
becomes trafficking

RONNA
Todd I would never fuck you like that

GAINES
How would you fuck me Would you strap it
on

He climbs over the sofa to a dresser In a drawer he digs
down through a pile of socks to find a wide-mouthed bottle
And an empty Tylenol bottle Blows out the dust

GAINES
Whats the occasion

RONNA
Theres this big Christmas party thing
Warehouse you know A bunch of us are
doing sort of a pre-party thing

GAINES
Friends of yours Youre not going to go
and try to sell this on me are you

RONNA
No

GAINES
Youre not dealing

RONNA
Swear to God
He transfers pills from the big bottle to the Tylenol bottle

GO 82698 Revisions

This is the real thing Pharmaceutical
grade not that crunchy herbal rave shit
Dont let anyone double dose or youll be
frying eggs off “em in the emergency room
One hit per headbanger

RONNA
Understood

He snaps the cap on tight

GAINES
Twenty at fifteen is 300

RONNA
Fifteen I was thinking more like ten

GAINES
You already did strap it on

RONNA
Its just that I know you charge Simon
ten

GAINES

Inflations a bitch
He offers it to Ronna who doesnt reach out for it

RONNA
Heres the deal Theres 20 of us I
need all of this But I only have two
hundred I mean thats all I have

Gaines undoes the cap of the Tylenol bottle starts pouring the
pills back out
RONNA (CONTD)
No hear me out This two-hundred is like
a downpayment You give me the stuff I
get the extra hundred from them then I
come right back and pay you

GAINES
See that would be doing you a favor and
you know how I feel about favors

RONNA
I could leave something with you
Collateral

He gives her a quick look over

settles into a piercing WHINE

Becky falls out of bed disoriented Sees the fire and
SCREAMS Rebecca climbs off Simon to attack the flames with a
pillow beating them down Holding her head together Becky
tries to reach the smoke detector itself

watches her but doesnt try to catch her eye The Jamaican

trying to undo her bra They take a break from undressing to
kiss harder

Reclining on the steps Claire tries to push his jeans down
with her toes Her foot gets caught in the chain from his
wallet Her butt slides down a step They laugh

Her hand hits something hard -- his gun Its tucked into his
jacket pocket

As they start to work up a rhythm Huxley the cat comes down
the steps curious He brushes against them unnoticed
