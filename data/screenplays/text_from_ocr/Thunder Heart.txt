A DRUM Beating slow And deep Like a heart

FADE IN

EXT THE GREAT PLAINS SOUTH DAKOTA - DAWN

Something is rising from the Black Hills A sphere of
too red to be the sun A sphere of contained fire

in crimson and ochre and rising slowly majestically
the pulse To the DRUM It is the sun But it is a Paha
sunrise A Black Hills sunrise And it is spectacular
The DRUM pounds deeper bigger as the sun gets
Stronger Igniting a vast landscape of gentle slopes
foothills throwing shadows on the plains that look

the Indians say an old man dancing The grass is

And high The wind moves through it snakes through it
Slowly

INSURANCE

And now rising up over one of the small land waves a
comes into view Shoulders A man running in ghostly
MOTION his long black hair trailing in the wind The
MAN wears only buckskin pants and a bone choker around
neck

Legs and arms churning the man runs with antelope
backlit by the sunrise bounding toward us Running
heart pounding SONG RISING DRUM POUNDING FIVE
VOICES in high-pitched tremolo join the song

And then the runner soars like an eagle from a bluff
airborne flying over a small dip arms outstretched

would be a wondrous thing if there were not a fine

mist all around him and if slow motion was not suddenly
overtaken by LIVE SPEED revealing the brutal force of

which has slammed the Indian into the air throwing
Slamming him hard into the grass And it is over as
and violently as a deer shot dead

Ray theres been a homicide out in
an area known as The Badlands Indian
Reservation

COOCH
Its not the first Theres been
several And our field office in
Rapid City is getting a lot of heat
none of the investigations have turned
up jack shit

TULLY
The main problem is Ray these people
are extremely distrustful of
outsiders non-Indians Relations
have not been amicable

COOCH
Different culture Hard to penetrate
The Indians dont like white cops
poking around And thats why were
in a position where we have to bring
in an American Indian agent

Tully straightens the edges of a bureau memorandum

TULLY
With an Indian representative out
there we hope to keep hostilities
dormant this is a COINTELPRO

Cooch opens a folder that sits between them and taking
his
eyes off the road for a dangerous five seconds locates
some
photos and hands them to Ray Rays expression tells
us

they are not pretty

Those are two agents who went into a

a warrant They were executed at

police officer killed by the Mohawks
up in Canada more recently

The agents who have worked out here
say its like going into Nam
Unfamiliar terrain foreign language

appreciates the sting of a right off a left

youthful look despite a face like a map of the

His brown wrinkled hands run over the top of the

pack as if hes reading braille

reading of the young man Slowly he sits up --
focusing

intensely on Ray

spoken like it used to be gesturing toward Ray When

finishes he sits back in his chair Ray looks
intrigued

flinch

that you come here He says lets
smoke the caanunpa the sacred pipe
symbol of truth So that there will
be no lies between us

The old man has taken a long wooden stem and a red

bowl from a beaded pipe bag He joins the two together
begins offering a pinch of tobacco to the Four
While this goes on Ray fidgets

RAY

You dont smoke with him it means
youre hiding something
Ray takes the pipe looks at it then passes it to

Crow Horse puffs hard eyes closed then slowly

some smoke upward Ray watches it climb and fade The
man then takes up an old turtle shell rattle He

speaks
CROW HORSE
He says Wakan Sacred Five hundred
year old turtleshell rattle passed
down from the Grandfathers Heavy

He shakes the rattle very slightly moving it in front
of
Ray He speaks just above a whisper
CROW HORSE
He says it is good The Spirits are
here The Spirits want to know what
youre doing here
Ray smirks
RAY
Tell him Im trying to find the man
who murdered Leo Fast Elk Ask him
if he knows where he is
Crow Horse asks the old man in Lakota No answer The
pipe
is back to grandpa and he offers it to the Directions
to

to
speak again
Passionately In long glottal Sioux sentences adding
sign
fingers crossing brushing an arm a slap here and
there
He is working himself into an excited state and Ray
keeps
looking at Crow Horse very interested in the old mans
answer
Finally Grandpas breath comes up short and wheezing

ends his oratory with a solid hand slap

He strokes his badger claw necklace
Crow Horse looks at Ray and seems hesitant to translate

Uh Grandpa likes to trade no one

in the old Indian barter He uh

Grandpa smiles toothlessly Ray who has his driving
in hand lifts them to say these but Grandpa sees it
an accepted deal and swiftly removes his necklace He
it out
Ray slowly hesitantly surrenders his sunglasses and
the necklace Crow Horse bursts into laughter and so
Grandpa enjoying a good trade He draws a hand through

car pulled into the yard He came
out approached the vehicle then saw
that the man behind the wheel was

trailer but the car came highballing
at him He started running for the
open grass With the car moving

took aim -- missed once hitting the

came to a stop in the grass And

Looks Twice was nowhere near there
Ya see when Jimmy was twelve years
old his mother and father was killed
in a car wreck right down there near
Elk Mountain

RAY
I dont see the connection

CROW HORSE
The connection is it did a head
number on him Hes petrified of
cars Wont drive Ive known him
all my life and hes never gotten
behind the wheel of a vehicle He
rides passenger and he rides horses
and thats it The man that shot Leo
down was behind the wheel of a moving
car

Ray absorbs this with great interest

Thats not solid

print he left in the Badlands -- the
one the FBI missed and then stepped
all over -- it belongs to a man who
walks heels first Like a white man

murdered Leo walked like a Wasicu
