SHOOTING SCRIPT July 27 2015

INT UPPER WEST SIDE SCHOOLCLASSROOM - DAY

Loud conversation laughter singing and even dancing the
teacher is missing in a 7th Grade classroom This rare
absence of authority is intensely enjoyed by the crowd It
looks like its party time for these KIDS

They talk and laugh show each other photos on their phones
draw spaceships and baboons on their notebooks and fold
pieces of paper into airplanes that fly around the room

n a corner a GROUP OF GIRLS dance to the tune of a song
they are listening to on headphones

On the other side of the room TWO BOYS play like in a sword
fight without swords

Suddenly someone turns out the lights Theres random
shouting and laughter

An overhead projector is turned on and a couple of the kids
start to make puppet figures that are seen on the white
screen

A door opens and a voice is heard grave and authoritative

MR PLUMMER (0S)
What is going on here

The kids scramble back to their seats as the lights go on
MR PLUMMER the teacher has come in

MR PLUMMER
What is this mess Didnt you
promise me to be quiet Cant I
even leave you alone for five
minutes Lionel sit down Sit
down I said Melissa put your
phone away Put it away right now
I asked you to be quiet and
look at you What a disappointment

Mr Plummer wanders around the classroom inspecting
everyone Each kid has a different reaction Some are
frightened others think its funny Some are respectful
some others defiant

and

The teacher stops by a desk thats covered by a VERY COLORFUL

DRAWING while the STUDENT rushes to put away his large
collection of Caran dAche pencils neatly in the box

MR PLUMMER (CONTD)
Jacob what is this
Shooting Script 072715 2

JACOB JAKE JARDINE is pale and slender with straight black
hair a bit longer than the other kids and deep brown eyes -
pretty in a delicate way and shy different from the other
tougher boys in the class

JAKE
Its the sky Mr Plummer

Mr Plummer picks up his drawing and shows it to the class

MR PLUMMER
A green sky with yellow stars

JAKE
(barely audible)
Its Camp Jupiters sky

MR PLUMMER
Watch out Jacob Vincent van Gogh
ended up cutting off his own ear

Some of the boys have a ball with this Girls cover their
mouths not to laugh out loud Jake blushes his eyes fill up
with quiet angry tears he wasnt even talking to anyone
he was just drawing doing his thing Life is so unfair

MR PLUMMER
Quiet I said quiet everybody
This is not a playroom Its not an
art studio Much less a disco Ms
Neves Its a classroom It is my
classroom and I asked you to be
quiet A simple request and you
showed me you dont know how to
behave yourselves Was I talking to
the walls Amanda please collect
everybodys homework and bring
them to me

AMANDA the teachers favorite promptly goes around the
class collecting homework The individual students now listen
intently to Mr Plummers speech But there are exceptions
one or two still defy his authority swallowing a laughter
that cannot contain itself

MR PLUMMER (0S)
If I had to leave the class it is
because I had something very
important to do I come back and I
see you screaming and dancing
Theres a saying its an old
saying that says Silence is
golden Write this down children

(MORE)

Shooting Script 072715

MR PLUMMER (0S) (CONTD)
Silence is golden but my eyes still
see Talking is cheap people
follow like sheep

Mr Plummer writes this up on the board Jake instead of
writing furiously draws a wild dancing cobra on his
notebook

MR PLUMMER
What does this mean

Amanda raises her hand ready to give an answer

MR PLUMMER
Not now Amanda I want you all to
write down your thoughts on this
silence is golden

He underlines silence is golden on the board

MR PLUMMER (CONTD)
Every child is to write an essay on
its meaning Two pages minimum
Thats your homework for tomorrow
Dont even come to the class if you
havent done it Now lets open
our books Page 23 Lionel start
reading from the top Stand up
please Stand up so we can all hear
you

cigarette and leans on the gate calmly surveying the street -
a daily routine

look of people who can afford to take a nice vacation once a
year

Jake sees when ANTONIO TONY CALVELLI a handsome 13 year
old boy with dark hair and eyes comes running out from
inside the store and stops next to Leonor

Shooting Script 072715 8

with an extended hand
BRIAN

Brian and Kathy go upstairs with their bags

Left alone by the car Jake tries to grab a sketchbook from
inside as he balances the big plate of food with his other
hand and then a bit clumsy ends up dropping the bag

Tony is suddenly there to help him out He kneels down to
pick up pages with drawings pencils and stuff spilling out
of the bag immediately recognizing the first drawing he sees
- a girl with red wings flying through a thundercloud

TONY

The two boys follow Brian towards the house the three of

INT JARDINE APARTMENTFAMILY AREA - DUSK

The apartment is old and in desperate need of a paint job
Its a large space crammed with the stuff of a long life
There are family photos piles of National Geographic
magazines next to faded velvety couches and solid furniture
A small vintage color TV sits alone in the corner

Theres a quiet reception going on with most people wearing
black or dark colors and talking softly to each other
Amongst the mostly older friends and relatives of the
deceased are Brians sister AUDREY and her husband JAMES and
their teenage son LIAM dressed in a suit They are sitting
on a couch next to Brian leafing through a photo album

with new ones from a box from an Italian bakery Pilar is
beside her cutting fruit for a pitcher of punch

INT JARDINE APARTMENTFAMILY AREA - DAY 6B

Jake is sipping some juice like a cocktail and looking at
the art on the wall a couple of oil paintings of Parisian
streets in the wintertime of dubious quality doesnt arouse
much interest and he ends up in front of a vintage movie
poster on the wall with ahead of its time 60s graphics -
probably the best piece of art in the apartment

BRIAN (0S)

Jake goes to see his father whos standing next to STU
GERSHMAN a well dressed gentleman in his 70s

BRIAN

JAKE
Okay

STU GERSHMAN
So what kind of sports do you like
to play
Shooting Script 072715 13

Jake doesnt play any sports and its probably a point of
contention between father and son given the sudden
uncomfortable moment of silence

BRIAN
He likes to draw and paint

Jake blushes

STU GERSHMAN
So youd like to be an illustrator
when you grow up

JAKE
I dont know

STU GERSHMAN
Well come here Come here

He pulls Jake in uncomfortably tight

STU GERSHMAN
I want to tell you a few things
about your grandfather Jake he
liked to play ball but was a
horrible pitcher he hated summer
but went nuts seeing the ladies
walk by in mini-skirts and he was
the most loyal friend you could
have Loyalty was his greatest
quality

BRIAN
Aww Thanks Stu Did you hear
that Jake

Jake is saved from Stu by a knock on the door He runs to
open it and there she is Leonor holding a beautiful cake
Kathy who also heard the knock comes to see whats going
on

LEONOR

occasions in my country

She hands the cake to Kathy

LEONOR

the beautiful cake on her hands She looks across the room
and sees Brian in the middle of a crowd holding court
being a good actor

successful or anything
Shooting Script 072715 30

scene from Pariah or the Outcast

for us to work on cause its just

LaGuardia Its for all kinds of
artists Its very Bohemian

Jake puts the script down uncommitted

JAKE

nurse and he works for Doctors
Without Borders which is from what
I can tell a job you get if you
want free plane flights

JAKE
Where is he now

TONY
Hes in Angola Thats in Africa
Until he was 20 he never left this
neighborhood and then once he left
he barely ever came back If I
wasnt here I dont think hed ever
come back to Brooklyn

Tony jumps up and goes to his desk

TONY
Look what he sent me

He pulls a box from a shelf full of books and CDs and stuff

JAKE
Do you miss having him around more

TONY
At first I did But its been a few
years now so I got used to it

JAKE
Sometimes my dad goes away if hes
shooting a movie But it hasnt

Shooting Script 072715 32

TONY
Found it

He picks up a big book and drops it in Tonys lap
TONY

My dad and I are going to go on a
safari and these are just like
some of the animals we are going to
see

Jake looks through pictures of African savannahs and animals

JAKE

together

TONY
Sometimes When my dad comes to
visit hell cook Porcheta Its
like roast pork butt

JAKE
Ewww
TONY
(matter of fact)
Its good
(pause)

We sit at the table just the three
of us and he tells stories about
his work and the places hes been
and stories about the different
people hes met in Africa Then it
seems like normal But then pretty
soon they start fighting about
something stupid And I realize
its better when hes not around

JAKE
Imagine if your mom goes with you
on your safari and they end up
falling in love again
Shooting Script 072715

TONY
I think theres very little chance
of that happening

JAKE
But just imagine you get an
envelope one day You open it and
its two tickets to a safari One
for you and one for your mom
And she decides to go because she
feels like she needs a vacation
So when you get to Africa your dad
picks you both up at the airport
and takes you to this incredible
place Like this photo here You
see lions and elephants giraffes
And then its the end of a
beautiful day in the African
savannah Your dad wants to take
you up this big hill to see the
sunset but youre too tired so
you tell your parents youre going
to rest in your hotel room

TONY
So they go the two of them alone
And when they get there the colors
of the sky are like nothing theyve
ever seen before

JAKE
A green sky with yellow stars

The door opens with Leonor in an apron and a wooden spoon in
hand

LEONOR
Who wants pasta primavera

JAKE
Yes

Jake jumps up and goes out running Tony stays in fora

listen listen and talk
(MORE )
Shooting Script 072715 43

ACTING TEACHER (CONTD)
Not to act The genesis of acting
is seeing Yes Thats the first
thing The raw material of all
acting is seeing observing
understanding what makes behavior
I would say pay attention So when
we start doing the repetition
exercise that person does it to
you you just react Whereas a lot
of actors make it happen Yes But
thats not acting Thats pushing
whereas you should just be relaxed

The kids are listening intently taking it in

ACTING TEACHER
Does that make sense

No one answers

ACTING TEACHER
Okay lets begin

BRIAN
The reason why Im here Leonor

LEONOR

know

BRIAN
Your lease has been expired for
more than six months now I guess
you guys were about to renew it
when my father passed

LEONOR

Leonor
Brian why dont you sit down

They go towards the back of the store Leonor sits behind her
desksewing machine Brian in front of her He opens his
messenger bag and takes out a brown envelope

BRIAN

My sister and I are working on the
transfer of ownership for the

house Its almost done Dad left
everything in order all the taxes
paid and all that The only thing
still pending is the store which
needs to have a new lease

Shooting Script 072715 56

LEONOR
You know your father never thought
much about contracts He was very
happy to have me here Max thought
my store gave glamour to the
neighborhood and he was proud to
be associated

BRIAN
The situation has changed and now
we have two families owning the
house mine and Audreys Its
better for us and for you to have
things done the right way wouldnt
you agree

LEONOR
It depends on what the right way is
for you

BRIAN

Leonor this neighborhood is
changing very fast The rents have
gone up quite a lot in the past few
years Im sure youve noticed

LEONOR
Yes I noticed and so did Max But
it was his desire that I stay here

BRIAN
We dont want you to go away My
sister Audrey has prepared a new
lease for you and we think its
very fair We arent trying to get
market rate here we know thats
not possible but still you cant
expect to pay the same rent you
paid when you first moved in

Brian pulls some papers out of his bag

BRIAN
Here why dont you take a look

LEONOR
Before we go any further with this
conversation I want you to take a
look at this

Leonor opens a drawer and takes out a small pile of
photographs She hands them to Brian
Shooting Script 072715

LEONOR
I am probably the last person to
have photos printed the old
fashioned way Its completely
different than seeing them on a
cellphone dont you agree

Brian looks through the photos Leonor looks over his
shoulder

LEONOR
Thats me in the backyard on July
4th Thats me and Tony and your
father at the Fair of St
Anthonys Thats us with my
family when they were visiting
Your father and I were very good
friends We spent a lot of time
together What you and your sister
dont understand is that Max wanted
me to stay here He thought of me
as part of this house this
neighborhood

He returns the photos to Leonor
LEONOR
I was more his family if you want

to know than you were

BRIAN
Thats a ridiculous thing to say

Brian is speechless

LEONOR
You hardly talked to each other
You never came to visit I was the
one here I saw him everyday

BRIAN
This is not what I came here for
Why dont we go back to the lease
Take a look please Its fair

LEONOR
No I dont need to I have an idea
what you and your sister have in
mind Ill just give this to my
lawyer because to be honest with
you Brian Im not sure I owe you
anything Maybe its the other way
around

mistakes That they try to do what
they think is right Does any of

shows it to the new salesgirl VALENTINA

They hear

LEONOR
Dresses go over there on that rack
on the left Before you hang them
make sure they have a price tag
Also try to arrange them by color
or tone I usually like to start
with lighter colors in the front
and end with darker ones Black
goes in the back The women here
like black a lot so if theyre
looking for a little black dress
they might see a lot of other stuff
before they get there

VALENTINA
I see So if they dont know what
they want I try to keep them here
in the front first and then show
them the ones in the back

LEONOR
Unless they ask specifically for
black

63 EXT JARDINE HOUSEBACKYARD - DAY

Leonor and Brian are standing outside Leonor lights a
cigarette

LEONOR
The day your father died he came
by in the morning I asked him to
buy me a pack of cigarettes and
then I never saw him again

Leonor gets emotional and a tear rolls down her face

LEONOR

Your father cared about me Brian
Do you believe that Every day we
would talk and we would share
things with each other Have you
ever had a friend like that
Someone you could tell anything

Shooting Script 072715 88

BRIAN
Only my wife Im a lot like Jake
Ive never been good at having
close friends

Leonor takes another drag

BRIAN
I hope you can understand that
whats happening is nothing
personal

LEONOR
I cant afford to pay three times
the rent I paid your father Its
not possible I cant survive

Brian doesnt respond

LEONOR
I thought you were in a new big
play

BRIAN
I am in a new play But its not
big and its not a lot of money
Its just the way it is Leonor
Im fortunate enough to have had a
father who left me a house in

Brooklyn

LEONOR
He wanted me to stay here He told
me so

BRIAN

Leonor I also have a sister and
she has her own family and we all
have to decide together what to do
Its not just up to me

Leonor takes a moment and then proceeds in a new direction

LEONOR
You know your father thought your
sister was the one who inherited
his brains

Brian doesnt know how to respond
Shooting Script 072715

BRIAN
They were very much alike Im sure
he would agree with Audrey that
above everything its important to
take care of business

LEONOR
No He wouldnt have agreed I can
promise you that

BRIAN
Leonor what do you want me to say
I have a family We have bills too

LEONOR
Do you know why your father didnt
go to your sons birthday party
the last one

BRIAN
He had the flu
LEONOR
No Thats maybe what he told you
The truth is he was embarrassed
Brian He was embarrassed that
everything in your house was paid
for by your wife He thought you
should be more of a man He hated
being around you

Brian tries to swallow some coffee but the cup is empty

BRIAN
Well hes not around anymore is
he

LEONOR

He certainly isnt

Leonor is on the couch in the office while Hernan
lawyer sits on the edge of the desk holding official court
room papers Hes very serious and shes clearly very upset

HERNAN
This Holdover clause is common in
any commercial lease

He hands her a piece of paper which she reads
Shooting Script 072715

LEONOR
What am I going to do I cant
afford this

Hernan comes closer and puts his hand on her shoulder
door opens all of a sudden and Tony storms in frightening

Leonor

LEONOR
Jesus I told you to knock before
you come in What do you want

Q
Tony laughs at the fright hes given Leonor
LEONOR

I am so tired of you playing this
silly game
Tony realizes by the tone of her voice that this is serious

HERNAN
Im sorry Leonor

He takes the paper from Leonors hands

LEONOR
Where do they even get this number

Her eyes fill up with angry tears

Tony sees his mothers eyes tear up with the news
to cry and its too much for him to bear He goes and hugs

HERNAN
The penalty for overstaying may
seem like a high number and it is
Thats why its in the contract to
prevent that the tenant overstays
paying below the market rent
indefinitely

LEONOR
Isnt there anything else we can
do

HERNAN
Leonor Ive done everything I can
Its over now You have a week to
leave the premises

place and give the money to Aunt
Audrey Tony and I are both going
to be at the LaGuardia High School
for Performing Arts in Manhattan
so I wont need to take the subway
or anything to school I can walk
And youll be closer to the

was really complex and everything

BRIAN
Jake do you by any chance remember
that story I told you about my
friend Tina

JAKE
The one who sold her hair in India
for a train ticket

BRIAN
No that was Martine Tina was a
girl I knew in high school who was
a dancer Her mother was a dancer
She was literally born to be a
dancer She had a perfect ballet
dancers body and all of us were
certain she was going to be a big
success

JAKE
Have I seen her dance

BRIAN
No During high school she got
into a really good conservatory
and I ran into her a couple of
times after that and she was
always about to get this or about
to get that But each time her arm
would be in a sling or she would
be on crutches She would have a
pulled ligament Or a stress
fracture in her back The last time
I saw her I ran into her on the
subway it was clear she hadnt
danced for years She was fat You
would have never imagined that she
was the same girl

JAKE
Gee thanks Dad Thats a very

encouraging story
Shooting Script 072715

BRIAN
Why do you think Tina didnt go
very far

JAKE
I dont know

BRIAN
She trained too hard She practiced
too much She didnt trust her own
natural abilities

He continues to wrap the bandage

BRIAN
Jake youre going to meet a lot of
really talented people in your
life But they wont all be suited
to be artists they wont all have
the brains to know when to insist
and when to stop When to push
yourself and when to relax Most
of them wont have that balance

JAKE
And how do I know if I have the
balance

BRIAN

Thats why Im telling you this
because youll turn in your
portfolio soon and theyre going
to love it Theyre going to love
you I know they will Youll go to
LaGuardia and youll have fun but
also plenty of challenges Soon
enough youll find out if you have
the balance

The bandage is done

BRIAN
There you go Do you know if Tony
got in

JAKE

I dont know I dont know what
hes doing
Brian looks at Jake

BRIAN
Son I wish Id done things
differently

Shooting Script 072715

BRIAN

had told you earlier what was going

some advice Would that be okay
