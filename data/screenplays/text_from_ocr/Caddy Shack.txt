EXT NOONAN HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

Its seven oclock and the birds are singing in the trees
outside an old two-story frame house with a sagging front
porch and peeling white paint only half-covered by a partial
paint job

MRS NOONAN (vo)
(shouting cheerily)

A dog begins BARKING

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Doors fly open and a half dozen children start pouring into
the hall racing for the bathroom and rough-housing down
the stairs

supportive manner The family COLLIE runs up the stairs

INT DANNY NOONANS BEDROOM - DAWN

The first light of day filters through the window revealing

an incredibly messy boys bedroom littered with dirty laundry
books comics broken toys and an electric guitar The walls
are covered with KISS posters framed athletic awards and
cheesy trophies on a homemade bookshelf Little League team
pictures and a poster-sized blow-up of John Belushi A broken
model spaceship dangles from a thread from the ceiling fixture

Three brothers share the room ANDY and BILLY twelve and
thirteen are getting dressed DANNY NOONAN age eighteen

good-looking athletic kid with a kind of quick natural
intelligence -- the oldest and biggest of the Noonan kids

INT DINING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

MR NOONAN Dannys father is trying to eat breakfast and
read the newspaper while the kids pop in and out of the
room He loves his children but over the years with each
new addition to the family hes come to feel more and more
like a forgotten guest in his own home

Danny comes through the dining room on his way to the kitchen

DANNY
Hi Dad Can I ---

MR NOONAN

DANNY
(protesting)

MR NOONAN

Danny goes through the open door into the kitchen unfazed by
his fathers churlishness

INT KITCHEN

MRS NOONAN is busy making fried egg sandwiches A crying
four year old clings to her apron while other kids pillage
the refrigerator spill milk and orange juice and slop
cereal into bowls The dog is barking the phone is ringing

He escapes to the dining room and without sitting down grabs
the pitcher of milk off the table and pours some on his ‘Cheerios

digging into his pocket Mr Noonan watches him through the
open door Mrs Noonan is wiping up spills and feeding the
dog at the same time

MRS NOONAN

With the argument continuing downstairs he goes to the
window and jumps out For a moment we think hes committed
suicide
EXT DANNYS WINDOW
He swings nimbly to a downspout hops to a tree branch

climbs through a weathered treehouse and slides down a

rope to the ground Then he jumps on a Sears ten speed
bike and pedals away

EXT SUBURBAN STREET

Danny rides down a street lined with houses like his own

EXT ANOTHER STREET

The houses are bigger the lawns wider and greener as
Danny crosses over into a more exclusive section of the
suburbs

EXT ANOTHER STREET

Now Danny is riding past large mansions on rambling estates

EXT BUSHWOOD COUNTRY CLUB

Danny turns down a private driveway flanked by two stone
columns On one column is a brass plaque that reads
Bushwood Country Club END CREDITS

EXT THE GOLF COURSE - A LITTLE LATER

Early morning mist rises from the golf course and shafts of
sunlight slant through the trees as we look at two figures
standing on the tee five hundred yards away One of the
figures swings a click is heard and ball sails into the
air It hangs for a long moment and drops right in the
middle of the fairway two hundred yards from the green

The golfer hands his club to his caddy and starts walking
toward the ball

As they approach we begin to see them more clearly It is
Danny caddying for TY WEBB a handsome thirty-ish bachelor
with clear eyes and an air of relaxed self control His
outfit is all soft flannel and cashmere Everything about
him tells us that he is the perfect golfer

TY AND DANNY

They walk along in quiet conversation Danny tries hard to
match Tys easy elegant stride

DANNY
Mr Webb can I ask you something

TY
Sure

DANNY
When you were eighteen do you
remember having trouble deciding
what you wanted to do with your
uh you knowlife

TY
Sure I didnt know whether to go
to West Point sail my fathers
ship to the islands or just take
a year off skiing in the Alps Why

DANNY
Forget it I dont think youd
understand

TY

Come on I know what you mean I
had the same problem at eighteen at
twenty-one twenty-five twenty-nine
and thirty-two -- and yesterday I
almost blew my brains out with a
silver-plated Beretta So whats

KNOWITALLIOE COMM

DANNY
What isnt my problem Did you

firewatcher What are you

DANNY
An underachiever
(shakes his head)

TY
Do you want to go to college

DANNY
In Nebraska Besides it costs
like eight thousand dollars a
year My Dad cant afford it

a lumberyard for the rest of
my life

TY
Whats wrong with lumber I own
two lumberyards

DANNY
I notice you dont spend too much
time there

TY
I dont know where they are

They reach Tys ball

THE LAKE

Tys ball rests near the edge of a beautiful lake that cuts
across the fairway On the opposite shore is a lovely
green flanked by sandtraps

TY
Okay Danny I think youve
suffered enough First lesson
Did you see Star Wars
(he takes a silk
scarf out of
his golf bag)

TY

space farm

DANNY
Thanks

TY
(blindfolding
himself)
Theres a force in the universe
that makes things happen Atl
you have to do is get in touch
with it

He fumbles with the clubs in his bag feeling for a seven
iron Finally he lifts the blindfold a little and takes
the right club Then he goes to his ball and takes a
blindfolded practice swing

TY
Find your center -- stop thinking
-- let it happen -- Be the ball --

(he swings and
hits the ball)

THE BALL

It sails over the lake hits high on the green and rolls back
down to within inches of the hole

DANNY AND TY
Danny stands there amazed Ty starts blindfolding him
DANNY
(surprised)

What

TY
Hit one Try it

Danny peeks to line up the shot then lowers the blindfold
and gets ready to hit

KWOWNTALLIOECOM

TY
(droning
hypnotically)
Just relax -- be the ball -- find
your center - turn off all the
sound - picture the shot -- be

completely still ---

DANNY
(impatiently)

Its a little hard with you talking
like that

TY
Oh All right -- Ill shut up --

talking

Danny swings and hits the ball Ty watches it rise and
drop into the lake

DANNY
taking off
the blindfold)
Whered it go

TY
Right in the lumberyard Well

figure out what you really want
Once you know everything else
takes care of itself

They walk off together A mechanical roar is heard

A HUGE TRACTOR MOWER

A huge grasscutter appears suddenly over a rise its big
plaid blower bags ballooning out from its sides The
GROUNDSKEEPER waves casually to Ty and Danny from his
tractor seat as he rumbles past them

CuT TO

EXT THE STREET

A public transit bus stops across the street from themain
entrance to the club The route sign on the front of ‘the

She laughs uncomprehendingly and continues talking in
Spanish to her friends

Two other caddies have arrived with the DAnnunzios --
GOOFY a gawky bespectacled sixteen year old and
MOTORMOUTH a fast-talking eighteen year old class clown

As they cut across the parking lot they check out the cars
of the club members

horn honks frantically The caddies slowly clear the
road as the driver guns his motor The moment theyre

sprawled on the grass

then looks at it realizing what hes done He gives the bag
a tentative shake and hears a 6000 tinkle of broken glass
and instruments

and tennis togs

JUDGE SMAILS

gouging deep holes around their golf balls as they repeatedly
swing and miss

He watches with weary patience as the Havercamps ineptly flail
away

SAM
Okay Mr Havercamp try looking

DANNY

He trots wearily across a fairway lugging both golf bags

He trips over Sandys water hose and falls flat on his face
The clubs spill out of the bags with a noisy clatter and
two dozen golf balls go rolling off in all directions

DANNY

God damn son of a bitch

His anger is cut short as he spots someone walking toward him

LACEY

Danny sees LACEY UNDERALL a very beautiful girl walking
toward him in a short very alluring tennis skirt She
has slim shapely legs long golden hair a great tan and
a cover-girl complexion Shes carrying a tennis racquet
and with one smooth move she bends slightly and scoops

up one of the golf balls that rolled away from Danny

LACEY
(tossing the
golf ball to Danny)
Walk much

DANNY
(stuffing the clubs
back into the bags)
Oh no I just -- I was just
resting

She smiles and walks away with a toss of her curls Her

walk is both sexy and athletic She absently brushes a
fly off the back of her thigh with her racquet

they hear the roar of a motor and turn to see the mower eat its
way through a tall thick hedge and right into their yard

The guests run screaming as the mower runs right over a loaded
buffet table sending up a shower of chopped cold cuts Then
it runs over a bed of carefully planted tulips and exits the
yard by eating through the hedge on the other side The

guests look after it stunned as Danny comes through the new
opening from Beepers yard He trots through the debris
bowing politely to everyone and disappears through the newly
cut exit on the other side
