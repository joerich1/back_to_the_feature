EXT APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS - MAGIC HOUR

The moon rises above the Appalachian Mountains as dusk slips
into night Thick fog pours down the jagged peaks into the
dense forest below

Deep in the woods dozens of pick-up trucks surround a
secluded wooden barn

SEVERAL GUARDS - shotguns and cowboy hats - line the dirt
road snaking into the darkness

INT BARN - NIGHT

Two SAVAGE DOGS a white pitbull and a black doberman

attack each other inside a crude fighting pit The dogs
GROWL BITE and TEAR each other apart as they fight for their
lives

Dozens of FARM HANDS BIKERS and TRUCKERS drinking beers and
moonshine CHEER and CURSE as the dogs continue their battle
BETS are placed MONEY exchanges hands

A SAVAGE RIPPING AND CRUNCHING SOUND sends the crowd into a
wild frenzy of applause

ROD PEPPER - 50s an ogre in farmer’s overalls and lamb chop
side burns - roars with laughter He leaps into the pit and
pulls his pitbull off the dead doberman

ROD
Good girl That’s a good girl

He cradles the pitbull like a baby kissing and licking the
blood out of her eyes before handing her off to a farm hand

RANGER - 30s muscled lean and mean with the feral eyes of
a predator - turns away from the display in disgust

Rod pushes through the crowd and bellies up next to the
Ranger

ROD
You don’t like what you see
Mister

RANGER

These pups are lame I’m looking
for a real fight

CUT TO
EXT DEER VALLEY NORTH CAROLINA —- DAWN

Deer Valley is a quiet rural community surrounded by dense
woods and high mountains It’s the kind of charming farm
town that has one high school two churches and three bars

Pick-up trucks rumble down main street A banner flies over
the road

awkward gangly teens around them They keep to themselves as
they cross towards Dominic’s Jeep

Dominic opens the door for his sister and then looks over at
Emma

Emma senses him watching her and turns She stares back at
Dominic The look between them is intense filled with
longing and pain

Finally Emma turns her back on Dominic fighting the tears
and climbs onto her Vespa

EXT STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Dominic lifts Emma’s Vespa off the ground and wheels it over
to her He shoots her a hangdog smile

DOMINIC

Emma tries to take the Vespa from him without a word
Dominic holds onto the handle bars

Dominic blows out his cheeks

DOMINIC
You didn’t do anything When my
mother found out we’d been seeing
each other she went nuts

EMMA
Why Because my mom’s a waitress
and my Dad ran out on us Because
I’m not good enough for you

DOMINIC
No it’s not that It’s a thing
with my family I’m not allowed to
date

Emma glares at him

EMMA
You’re not allowed to date or
you’re not allowed to date me

DOMINIC

to college

EMMA
You might have thought about that
before you said you loved me

DOMINIC
I didn’t know the rules then

EMMA
Well you should have asked You

DOMINIC
But I never lied to you

Emma looks at him for a beat fighting her tears as his words
sink in

EMMA

She spins around and marches back towards Rachel and Jimmy
DOMINIC

Jimmy and Emma climb out of the Bronco carrying towels and
flashlights

The Champ bows to a roaring crowd

Jimmy pulls his shirt over his head revealing a lean
muscled body Emma checks him out for a moment and then
pushes him into the water He SPLASHES into the lake

Emma sits down hanging her legs over the edge of the dock
She looks around stunned by the natural beauty

EMMA
I don’t want to talk about Dominic

JIMMY
This isn’t about Dominic it’s

signal

cheek

CRUNCHING though bone ECHOES through the forest

charges through the dark at full speed

Tenderly he pulls down the bed sheet revealing a blood
stained bandage covering Emma’s back Dominic glances at the

bruised but still walking His STUMP hangs limp at his
side Suddenly his ears prick up He looks around The

ragged BREATH

BACK TO SCENE

the blood drain from his face He drops to his knees

RACHEL
I can’t believe you made it out of
that alive

EMMA
This is bullshit We weren’t
drinking I’d remember that You
know I don’t drink

RACHEL
Maybe Jimmy had a couple

EMMA
No no I would have noticed This
is total bullshit There was no
accident Rach There was no
wreck The Sheriff must have faked
this whole thing

Rachel leans over the Bronco and studies the front of the
wreck She scrapes paint off the bumper with her nail

Rachel looks close and then SNAPS several photos with her
iPhone

RACHEL
Why would he do that

EMMA
I don’t know

BEHIND THEM

Jessica climbs out of Dominic’s Jeep

JESSICA
My dad found empty beer cans in the
car

EMMA

I don’t care what he found Jimmy
did not die in a car crash
alright We were attacked

Emma spins around and comes face to face with Dominic She
steps back startled

DOMINIC
What are you doing here Emma

JESSICA
She doesn’t remember the accident
She thinks Dad’s making it up

DOMINIC
Making what up

EMMA
There was no accident Dominic We
were attacked by a dog ora

wolf or something

DOMINIC
The coroner ruled Jimmy’s death an
accident Car accident End of
story

RACHEL
That’s not how she remembers it

DOMINIC
It was a car accident Emma You
guys were partying too hard It
happens all the time

EMMA
Why don’t you believe me

DOMINIC
You just accused my father of
faking a car crash to cover up
Jimmy’s death That makes one of
you a liar You keep lying and my
mother will have you locked up ina
looney bin

JESSICA
Dominic that’s enough

Emma stares at Dominic incredulous

EMMA
Is that a threat
DOMINIC
More of a prediction
JESSICA

that
DOMINIC

emotion

RACHEL
You OK

EMMA
No I’m so pissed I want to break
something
(beat)
(MORE )

EMMA (contd)

Do you ever feel like you’re going
crazy

RACHEL
Every day since the eighth grade
But if it makes you feel any better
I think we just got proof that the
Sheriff faked the accident

EMMA
What kind of proof

RACHEL
The Sheriff claims that Jimmy drove
into a truck right But there
wasn’t any other paint on Jimmys
Bronco Looks like it was crushed
by a compactor

EMMA
Are you sure

Rachel passes Emma her iPhone

RACHEL
Check the photos

CLOSE ON
The iPhone as Emma scrolls through digital shots Jimmy’s car

EMMA
Jesus You’re right

RACHEL
That’s exhibit number one Exhibit
number two I hacked into the
Sheriffs system last night and
downloaded the police report The
truck driver drove you to the
police station himself and the
Sheriff released him there and
then No breath test No
questions Nothing First off
how’s the trucker gonna drive his
truck if he crashed into Jimmy’s
Bronco Second there’s no way the
Sheriff would have released him if
he killed Jimmy No way

EMMA
Why would the Sheriff want to
invent this whole car crash story

RACHEL
It’s a conspiracy

EMMA
Come on this is serious Rachel
RACHEL
I am serious The army’s got
people training dogs to go after
the Taliban in Afghanistan

EMMA
What

RACHEL
They train these dogs to follow a
scent strap on a dynamite vest
send the pup inside the cave and
BOOM blow the poor bastard to
ell

EMMA
That’s horrible

RACHEL
The government’s got contracts with
kennels all over North Carolina
Your Forest Ranger is probably one
of these military dog trainers
That’s why they’re covering it up
I say we blow the whistle on the
whole lot of them

EMMA
How are we going to do that

RACHEL
Get the proof and post it all over
the web Bring them all down

EMMA
Bring down the government

RACHEL
Not the government you moron the
dog trainers Jimmy deserves
better than this bullshit cover-up
He would have done the same for us

right
EMMA
Yeah but
RACHEL
No buts end of discussion

We’re doing it

nervous

EMMA
What are we doing here

RACHEL
Exhibit number three

Rachel ducks under the police tape and searches the ground
camera phone in hand

RACHEL
Even if they swept the road this
whole area should be covered with
broken glass and debris from the
accident you know if there
was an accident

EMMA
The animal that attacked us was
killed by the truck But the
Forest Ranger could still be out
here Rach I don’t want to drag
you into something dangerous

me now if you tried
Emma stares out at the woods

SHERIFF

Suddenly the Sheriff senses something in the forest He
stares out into the trees

SHERIFF’S POV

Something moves deep in the woods

DEEP IN THE WOODS

The Ranger ducks back behind a tree hiding from the Sheriff

SHERIFF
Girls you know what You go on
ahead I’m gonna stay out here
Clean up this tape

EMMA
OK Thanks again

The girls climb into the car and drive away

The Sheriff waves good-bye to the girls and then his smile
fades He steps into the woods and rips the police tape down
off a tree He balls up the tape as he advances into the
woods

INT LUCKY DOG BARN - DAY

This massive barn has been converted into an animal rescue
shelter Dozens of animal cages spread out in every stall

MARTHA HESSMAN - 30s tall lean and more comfortable around
dogs than people - leads Emma and Rachel towards the cages
MARTHA
Wild animals stay away from humans
If it was a wolf it must have been
starving

EMMA
It didn’t look hungry

MARTHA
Then sick maybe Have you been
treated for Rabies

EMMA
I don’t know

MARTHA
That’s something you want to find
out Sooner you get treated for
rabies the better

EMMA
It wasn’t just hunting us It was
playing with us cutting us off
turning us around Like it was
enjoying it

MARTHA
Animals don’t kill for sport Emma
That’s a human trait

EMMA
There was a man with it he
looked like a Forest Ranger

MARTHA
Well that’s different Must have
been a trained animal It’s
impossible to train a wolf but it
could have been a husky or a wolf
hybrid

RACHEL
I read that the army’s been
training dogs to go after the
Taliban

MARTHA
Sure Schuzthund training The
army’s been using dogs since the
Second World War

EMMA
So one of these dog trainers could
have ordered his dog to attack us

MARTHA
It’s possible but I doubt it

EMMA
Why would the Sheriff claim that
Jimmy was killed in a car crash
(MORE )

EMMA (contd)

Why would he want to want to cover
up the truth

MARTHA
Folks have bred pit fighting dogs
for years up here A prize fighter
can be worth thousands of dollars
in stud fees It’s disgusting but
it happens

EMMA
I can’t believe the Sheriff would
be involved in something like that
The Butlers are such the perfect
family

RACHEL
Exactly Too perfect

As the girls approach the cages the dogs begin to HOWL and
SNARL They throw themselves at the cages trying to attack
Emma

EMMA
The rest of the town might believe
your bullshit car accident story
putt know what happened It was a
wolf

SHERIFF
It may have looked like a wolf but
it was something else

EMMA
Just let me out of here

The Sheriff unlocks the plexiglass cell and sets the tray and
water next to Emma

SHERIFF
It is very rare for a somebody to
survive a Tyeanthrope attack Most
people are killed by the trauma

EMMA
Lycan-what What did you say

SHERIFF
Lycanthrope Sounds crazy doesn’t
it
EMMA
You let me out of here RIGHT NOW

Dominic jumps on the arm Emma DIGS HER FINGERS INTO
DOMINIC’S NECK Dominic CHOKES in Emma’s grasp He tries to
break her grip but just can’t do it

Helen takes a SYRINGE from the medical tray and PLUNGES it
into Emma neck Emma SCREAMS and THRASHES but her hands
drop away from Dominic Dominic falls to the floor gasping
for breath

Emma pulls the syringe from her neck

HELEN
It’s a sedative Emma Just to

Your fever broke

EMMA
Have I gone crazy Dom Is that
why I’m here

DOMINIC
No You’re not crazy Here let
me untie you
He starts to untie the medical restraints
EMMA
What’s happened to me I keep
hallucinating

DOMINIC
You’re not hallucinating

Emma stares at him in disbelief

EMMA
So your dad is a

DOMINIC
A werewolf Yeah So am I

EMMA
How how did it happen

DOMINIC
I was born like this A pureblood

EMMA
Pureblood
DOMINIC
Either you are born to werewolf
parents in which case you are a
pureblood or you get bitten and
then you’re a mutt

EMMA
A mutt Nice

DOMINIC
The werewolf community is not known
to be politically correct

EMMA
Jesus Christ I can’t believe
were having this conversation So
your Mom and Jessica are both

DOMINIC
My Mom is a full blooded werewolf
She can trace her family back for
centuries Jessica carries the
genes but they’re recessive so she
can’t make the Change

EMMA
Is that a bad thing

DOMINIC
Not necessarily It’s rare but it
does happen Jessica’s family but
she will never be a full member of
the Pack

EMMA
Couldn’t you vote her in or
something

DOMINIC
Pack law is absolute There’s no
democracy

EMMA
So the wolf that attacked me is

SHERIFF
(os)
--not one of us

The Sheriff walks down the stairs

SHERIFF
He’s a rogue werewolf a drifter
from outside our territory

EMMA
The Forest Ranger

SHERIFF
That’s one of his disguises

EMMA
Then he’s dead I saw him hit by
the truck

SHERIFF

We are not so fragile as humans
Emma He’s alive

EMMA
How do you know

SHERIFF
Because he killed Sheila Jones last
night

EMMA

Sheila the nurse Oh God Why

SHERIFF
Ill explain after you get
something to eat You must be
hungry

EMMA
Starving

CUT TO

INT BUTLER RANCH HOUSE KITCHEN
A STEAK SIZZLES on the griddle

SHERIFF
Your metabolism is much faster now
You need to eat three times as much
as you did before

Emma and Dominic sit at the kitchen counter as the Sheriff
heaps their plates with steak and eggs They both drink
large glasses of milk

The Sheriff opens a carton of milk and drinks it straight
own

SHERIFF
We have to stop the Ranger before
he kills again

EMMA
Isn’t that what you do
DOMINIC
What
EMMA

Werewolves Kill people
SHERIFF
There are as many different kinds
of werewolves as there are humans
The werewolf council banned hunting
humans more than one hundred years
ago In the past werewolves hunted
on the fringes of society drunks
drug addicts and whores people
who were never missed their
bodies were destroyed and their
remains buried in the woods This
rogue werewolf the Ranger is
leaving human remains in the open
It is a direct challenge to my
authority

EMMA

But what does he want
DOMINIC

You
EMMA

What do you mean me

SHERIFF
The Ranger has marked you infected
you with the virus Now that
youre Changing your pheromones
attract him like a drug He will
track you and he will find you
But he cannot mate with you until
your Change is complete The
trauma would kill you

EMMA
Mate with me You’re kidding
right

SHERIFF
Female werewolves are hard to find

EMMA
And I’m guessing I don’t have a say
in the matter

DOMINIC
Don’t worry We’1l protect you
You’re one of us now one of the
Pack

EMMA

I don’t want to be one of the Pack
I don’t want to be a werewolf I
want the cure

DOMINIC
There is no cure

EMMA
Theres got to be something I can
oO

SHERIFF
The only way to stop the Change is
to sever the bloodline You must
kill the werewolf that infected you
before your Change is complete

DOMINIC
I thought that was a myth

SHERIFF
There are no modern records but

EMMA
(incredulous)
Kill the werewolf How am I
supposed to do that Silver
bullets or something

SHERIFF
Silver bullets wolfsbane and the
full moon that’s just mythology
This is real Emma We’re tough
but any weapon that will killa
human will kill a werewolf And
you have an advantage You are
like junk to a junkie He’1ll come
looking for you and he will find
you

EMMA
That doesn’t sound like much of an
advantage

SHERIFF
Well be waiting and when he shows
himself we will strike

EMMA
So I’m the bait
SHERIFF
Exactly
DOMINIC

No Dad that’s way too dangerous

HELEN AND JESSICA

Walk into the kitchen in their dressing gowns rubbing the

sleep from their eyes

eye

HELEN
That’s quite right hook you’ve got
Emma

Helen has a nice shiner under her

EMMA
I’m sorry

Helen smiles at her She takes the MILK CARTON out of the
Sheriffs hand and passes him a glass

HELEN
Just because you’re a werewolf
doesn’t mean you have to drink like
an animal

The Sheriff rolls his eyes Helen smiles back at him

JESSICA
How are you feeling Em

EMMA
Upside down Everything I have
ever known to be true is wrong

JESSICA
That sounds about right

DOMINIC
It’s going to be OK

Emma smiles at him Dominic reaches out and takes her hand
Helen doesn’t like the look between them

HELEN
Emma even if you do survive the
Change you’re too young to take a
mate

DOMINIC
Mom

HELEN
I see the way she looks at you

EMMA
OK this is getting creepy now
I’ve always been a little jealous
of your family of how close you
are but I don’t want to be a
werewolf I don’t want any part of
your pack I just want to get my
life back

SHERIFF
That’s what we want too That’s
why we need to help each other

EMMA
You locked me in a cage Sheriff
I don’t really feel like helping
you 111 find my own cure

HELEN
That’s impossible

EMMA
Then Ill find a way to kill the
Ranger myself Unless you plan on
keeping me locked up here forever

DOMINIC
No Em we’d never do anything
like

HELEN

(interrupting) a
That’s not your decision Dominic

Emma turns to the Sheriff

EMMA
Well are you going to let me go or
not

SHERIFF

(nods )
I don’t want to make you a
prisoner Emma But I want you to
understand that it is not safe for
you outside this house He will
find you I won’t be able to
protect you out there

EMMA
I don’t want your protection I
dont want anything to do with you

Emma pushes past Helen and leaves
Dominic gets up but the Sheriff holds him back
JESSICA
Dad what are you doing She’1ll
die on her own
HELEN

You heard Emma She doesn’t want
our protection

JESSICA
She doesn’t understand

Emma just keeps on walking

INT BUTLER KITCHEN -— CONTINUOUS

Helen turns on the Sheriff

HELEN

SHERIFF
Shell flush the Ranger out into
the open Then we can finish him
off ourselves

JESSICA
What if she’s killed

HELEN
Then that’s one less thing we have
to worry about

JESSICA
That’s not fair

SHERIFF
It’s not my job to be fair It’s
my job to protect my family You
should know that

Dominic walks back into the room

DOMINIC
That’s not good enough Dad If
anything happens to Emma you will
never see me again

his REARVIEW MIRROR Emma leans against his shoulder and
smiles up at him

DOMINIC

Dominic’s Jeep speeds past an old sign peppered with bullet
holes and the words

The Jeep disappears into the sunset and a WOLF steps into

The moon rises over the horizon and the wolf HOWLS

FADE TO BLACK
