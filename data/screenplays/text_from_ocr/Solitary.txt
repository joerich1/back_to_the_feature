TEASER
EXT UNFAMILIAR BEACH - DAY 1
XCU - A MAN’S BLOODSHOT EYE as it scans something

WIDEN to find SAYID sitting in the sand alone -- staring at
a photograph in his hand running his fingers over it

HIS POV - It’s one of the retrieved photos from the fuselage
in “Walkabout” -- The mysterious ARAB WOMAN

EXTREME WIDE SHOT to see just how alone he is The beach is
empty as far as the eye can see as Sayid shoves the photo
into his nearby backpack and stands

CLOSER AGAIN as he stares down the lonely stretch of beach
before him then stops when something catches his eye

A SMALL LOOP OF CABLE jutting out of the sand the sun
GLINTING off exposed metal wiring where the coating’s eroded

Sayid moves to it reaches down to pick it up When he does -
A STAGGERING LENGTH OF CABLE bursts out of the sand running
in a straight line from the ocean running toward the jungle

ON SAYID -- he reacts stunned What the hell He snatches
up his bag and begins to track the wire into the jungle

INT SAWYER’S TENT - MEANWHILE 2

CLOSE ON a bandaged arm as fingers slowly pry up the adhesive
tape around the dressing

SAWYER (0S)
Ow -- Easy jackass

Widen to find JACK sitting next to a reclining SAWYER
removing his bandage Fresh gauze and tape lie beside Jack

JACK
You want it easy quit moaning
I’ve got to change these bandages --

SAWYER
Yeah well try not taking my skin

JACK
Hold Still

Sawyer eyes Jack a beat as he continues easing off the tape

SAWYER
So considerin’ we pretty much hate
each other how’d I score the house
call Dr Quinn
(then baiting him)
Tryin’ to ease your conscience
And Jack does his best not to take that bait --
JACK
My conscience is fine thanks
SAWYER JACK
Yeah
-- Yeah
SAWYER
‘Course -- what you got to feel

guilty about You let that damn
Arab torture me Stood by and
watched So now you just patch me
up and you get your ticket into
heaven Only reason youre here
is

ee

JACK
I’m here --
(locks eyes with Sawyer
intense)
Because no one else wants anything
to do with you

HF

Sawyer takes that in a moment soberly Then

SAWYER
She does

Jack glances up at him on that Then he stands and tosses
the fresh bandaging and tape he brought onto Sawyer’s lap

JACK
Change your own damn bandages

He turns and goes

OFF SAWYER - glaring after him

EXT BEACH - CONTINUOUS 3

ON KATE feeding wood into the signal fire Sayid created as
she stares off down the beach keeping a kind of vigil

JACK (0S)
Looking for someone

Kate turns to see Jack coming up behind her

JACK (CONTD)
-- Or just admiring the view

Still harboring anger Kate turns back toward the beach

KATE
It’s been two days Jack
JACK
What
KATE
Two days since Sayid took off on
his own
(beat)
I keep thinking I’m gonna look up
and see him coming back
ON JACK registering that and feeling badly about it
JACK
He’1l come back when he finds what
he’s looking for The French
transmission
KATE
He wasn’t looking for anything --
He left because of what happened
because of what he did
Jack shakes his head Got it from Sawyer -- now her too
JACK
It was an accident --
KATE
(sharply)

-- Yeah well accidents happen
when you torture somebody Jack

Jack can only look at her feeling ashamed Kate looks back
at him for a beat maybe feeling a little sorry --

KATE (CONTD)
I’m worried about him He’s out
there Alone

JACK
(comforting)
Sayid’s a trained soldier Kate
He can take care of himself

EXT JUNGLE - DAY 4

WITH SAYID as he tracks the cable deeper into the jungle
until he suddenly comes to an abrupt halt -- and slowly
lowers himself to a crouch in order to get a good look at
something at mid-calf level

REVERSE ON HIM as he leans in RACK FOCUS to reveal A
TRIP WIRE - fishing line stretched across his path Clearly
a booby-trap

ON SAYID - HOLY SHIT Somebody is or was here His head
snaps around scanning the area then rises After a beat
he carefully steps over the wire and takes another step

CLOSE ON HIS FOOT as -- CLICK

SAYID looks down realizing he’s stepped on a pressure
trigger What happens next happens instantly he curses
himself under his breath --

SAYID
Ya Allah--

-- as a noose under his foot ensnares him and he’s yanked off
his feet into the air As the rope goes taut his body
pendulums HARD into a tree SLAM --

QUICK CLOSE UP of his thigh getting impaled on a broken
branch jutting from the tree causing him to cry out As he
swings away from the tree he takes the branch with him
WIDE ON SAYID hanging twenty feet off the ground swinging
upside down the broken branch protruding from his leg -- His
SCREAMS piercing the quiet jungle

BLACK OUT

ACT ONE
INT THE VALLEY - EVENING 5

CLOSE ON MEAT ON A SPIT as a knife carves off slices WIDEN
to see LOCKE doing the butchering as he serves a few waiting
people including HURLEY holding airplane trays and whatever
else passes as a plate or bowl in this place

AN ESTABLISHING PAN ACROSS - We find the dozen denizens of
the valley including MICHAEL and CHARLIE eating their
dinners tearing away the fatty grizzle While some may sit
here quietly -- depressed -- others seem considering
everything to be doing all right some are talking

CHARLIE still going through late stage withdrawal puts down
his barely touched food clearly having no appetite as

SHANNON walks by holding an empty water bottle We follow
her as she crosses to the spring We find WALT there
feeding pieces of meat to VINCENT who then starts lapping up
water in the pool

ON SHANNON as she sees that

SHANNON
(to Walt)
Ew -- Get him out of there
WALT
What
SHANNON

The dog Webster It’s drinking
our water

MICHAEL (0S)
Hey --

MICHAEL steps in

MICHAEL (CONTD)

problem

SHANNON
My problem I walked all the way
from the beach to get something to
drink and your animal’s drooling
in our water supply

Hurley passes by with two trays of boar meat

HURLEY
Y’know dogs’ mouths are cleaner
than humans’

SHANNON
Nobody asked you

HURLEY shakes his head and continues on as VINCENT suddenly
hops into the pool wading around to SHANNON’s horror

SHANNON (CONTD)
Oh my God -- DO SOMETHING

INT THE VALLEY - INFIRMARY CAVE - CONTINUOUS 6

ON JACK examining the side of a shirtless SULLIVAN (late
forties thin) SUN is there too mashing aloe leaves in a
bowl showing concern about all the yelling outside Hurley
enters with the food Jack glances at him

JACK
What’s going on out there

HURLEY
Ah you know the usual People
yelling at each other over nothing

SULLIVAN
So what do you think Doc This
rash It’s bad isn’t it Some
kinda jungle disease or--

JACK
Hives

SULLIVAN

Hives What is that like a
poison ivy--

JACK
It’s a common rash Sullivan
Brought on by heat And stress
Just try to relax It’ll clear up

SULLIVAN
You sure I mean It really
itches And burns a little

SUN
(in Korean)
Its ready

(CONTD) 6

Jack turns to Sun who hands him the bowl He nods gratefully
to her and she goes Jack passes the bowl to Sullivan

JACK
Here This should help with the
itching And the burning Just
try to get your mind off it

SULLIVAN
Uh O-okay Thanks

He turns and exits After he’s gone Hurley hands Jack a
tray of food As they move to sit

HURLEY
“Get your mind off it” What else
is that dude gonna do but stress

JACK
I’ve got enough on my plate without
having to treat hypochondriacs

HURLEY

That’s like my point man We’re
all fried I mean have you taken
a look at those people out there
Everybodys way tense y’know
since we were in a plane crash
And Sayid splitting like that

(then)
Plus we got like no real plan
to get off this island

Jack looks wearily at Hurley who backs off a little

HURLEY (CONTD)
I’m just saying It’d be sweet
to have something to y’know do

JACK
Look I sympathize But we’re
surviving That’s my main concern
right now Keeping us alive
(then)
Things could be worse

Hurley considers that for a moment then

EXT JUNGLE - MEANWHILE 7

WIDE ON SAYID hanging upside down impaled by the branch
Nothing but his labored breaths and the sounds of the jungle

CLOSER as he with great effort and GRUNTING IN PAIN pulls
himself up and tries to pry the branch from his leg
Failing after several agonizing seconds he falls back

WIDE AGAIN as his screams echo through the jungle

ON SAYID as the pain subsides he closes his eyes and begins
to mutter something We realize he’s praying in ARABIC --

SAYID
There is no divinity except God
What God has willed must be --

Suddenly there’s a noise Twigs snapping Sayid’s head
snaps around He looks into the dense brush seeing nothing
Then another noise A rhythmic rubbing sound

SAYID (CONTD)
Hel--Hello

CLOSE ON the pulley rig responsible for suspending him TILT
DOWN to a GLOVED HAND cutting the taut rope with a machete

ON SAYID -- the instant he realizes what’s happening -- The

rope is severed and he plummets downward WHAM Sayid

lands his head slamming hard into the ground Barely
conscious head bleeding he looks and sees

HIS POV - BLURRY - A FIGURE standing in the shadows at the
edge of the dense jungle looking at him

SAYID registers that for a split second before he passes out

DISSOLVE TO WHITE Under which we hear a VOICE -- sounding
distant distorted almost as if underwater -- asking
something Gradually the Voice becomes clearer and we
realize it’s speaking RUSSIAN Then PORTUGUESE

INT HABITAT — LATER 8

DISSOLVE IN CLOSE ON SAYID as his eyes flutter open
squinting against a BRIGHT LIGHT shining in his face His
head’s been carelessly bandaged As he hears

SAYID
(weakly)

Wha-- What

WIDEN as Sayid tries to move and discovers his hands are
chained to a rusty metal cot wires running from it

FIGURE
Where is Alex

He peers past the light into the dark corner of the room We
see the FIGURE sitting there in the shadows

SAYID
Who-- Who are you

FIGURE
(more demanding)
Where is Alex

SAYID
I I don’t-- I don’t know what --

ON THE FIGURE’s HAND as it moves a wire to a METAL POST
protruding from a bank of BATTERIES The LIGHT DIMS as

SAYID suddenly lurches -- a considerable voltage of
electricity is pumped into the cot We hear the HUM of the
current accompanied by Sayid’s grunts until

ON FIGURE - as the wire is removed the LIGHT brightens
again Sayid falls back onto the cot short gasping breaths

VOICE SAYID
Where is Alex -- Please -- Listen to me
I don’t know any Alex I’m --

The Figure touches the post with the wire The LIGHT DIMS
SAYID again lurches PUSH IN ON HIM as he shouts

INT IRAQI BASE - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK 9
CLOSE ON AN IRAQI PRISONER face bruised lip bleeding --

hands tied in front his feet shackled to the legs of a chair
in the middle of the room muttering shaking his head

PRISONER
(in Arabic)
Stop

POW He’s punched across his jaw SWING around to reveal

SAYID in Republican Guard uniform shaking off the pain in
his knuckles Behind him leaning on a wall next to a desk
arms folded an Iraqi officer -- OMAR watches with interest

SAYID
(to Prisoner in Arabic)
You want me to stop Falah Then
start answering my questions
because I can do this all day

PUSH IN as he puts his mouth right up to the Prisoners ear

SAYID (CONTD)
I assure you we already know the
truth But I want you to admit it

CLOSE ON SAYID’S MOUTH NOW as the dialogue turns to ENGLISH
(Yes the ol’ “Hunt for Red October” bit) and we start to
slowly PULL OUT again as Sayid straightens

SAYID (CONTD)
-And all the pain will stop
Your Shiite friends have already
implicated you in the bombing

PRISONER
Youre you’re lying They would
never --

SAYID

They would and they have You
planned the attack Falah You
planted the device in Najaf -- the
Baathist headquarters You killed
two soldiers yes

FALAH stares up at him through swollen eyes

PRISONER SAYID
I had nothing nothing -- Confess it And perhaps
to do it will only cost you your

hands instead of your life

CLOSE ON FALAH - He opens his mouth to speak but instead he
throws his head to the side and vomits BELOW FRAME

ON SAYID stepping back looking a little unnerved PUSH
past him to see OMAR as a grin comes to his lips

EXT IRAQI BASE - LATER - FLASHBACK 10

OMAR and SAYID exit the building An Iraqi GUARD stationed
at the door salutes Omar He returns the salute As they
walk the CAMERA arcs around them we see (through the magic
of GREEN SCREEN) a desert landscape beyond the army camp

SAYID
He doesn’t know anything Your
sources were wrong

OMAR
(with a shrug)
Perhaps But that’s really not the
point is it You handled yourself
well in there

SAYID
Did I

OMAR
I‘1l put in for your reassignment
to the Intelligence Division if
you still wish it

Sayid halts a big smile crosses his face

SAYID
Yes sir Very much so

OMAR
(returning the smile)
Good But stop calling me “sir”
when it’s just the two of us

SAYID
You’re my superior officer Omar
For now Enjoy it while you can

Past them we see TWO ARMED GUARDS walking in their
direction escorting a FEMALE PRISONER

OMAR
That reminds me a promotion is
commensurate with your move

As the FEMALE PRISONER passes Sayid throws a glance at her

LOST Solitary (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 10404 12
(CONTD) 10

SLIGHT SLO-MO as she glances back at him and we may
recognize It’s the woman in the photo Sayid carries But
Sayid appears only to register some small recognition

OMAR (0S) (CONTD)
That is if you won’t miss being a
Communications Officer

SAYID
I’m willing to make that sacrifice
OFF SAYID grinning
INT THE VALLEY - NIGHT 11

CLOSE ON BAGS - a long vinyl one and a canvas suitcase -
dumped on the ground

WIDEN to see they’ve been dropped next to HURLEY sitting by a
campfire The rest of the camp is quiet as everybody else
has turned in Hurley looks up at

ETHAN (thirties unassuming oddly still) standing by him

ETHAN
Hi

Hurley peers up at him unsurely Then at the bags

HURLEY
Yo What’s this

LOCKE appears dropping a third bag as Hurley stands

LOCKE

LOCKE (CONTD)
Spotted tracks we think might be
rabbit or some other rodent

HURLEY

ETHAN
Figured people are starting to get
tired of eating boar meat
(raises his eyebrows)
Variety is the spice of life

HURLEY
Dude you got that right
(then)
Okay I’11 check out the bags

Hurley grabs a suitcase and starts going through it ON
LOCKE and ETHAN moving out when they hear

WALT (0S)

Ethan moves on as Locke turns and sees Walt walking up
speaking quietly

WALT (CONT’D)
Are you going back out to hunt

MICHAEL
I know what you’re doing man Not

Walt glares at his dad embarrassed and frustrated He peers
at Locke for a moment then stalks to his cubby as Michael
and Locke exchange a look Then Locke and Ethan turn and go

ANGLE ON HURLEY emptying the contents of the open suitcase
He holds up an impossibly ugly Hawaiian shirt shakes his
head and tosses it aside Then he unzips the long vinyl bag

CLOSE ON HIM as he looks inside and reacts eyes widening

HURLEY
Oh Duuude

He looks up and a smile comes to him as he registers an idea
INT HABITAT - NIGHT 12
CLOSE ON SAYID his eyes clenched shut his body TENSING as
we hear the HUM of electricity To escape the graphic nature
of this we illustrate it through the DIMMING of the BRIGHT
LIGHT still focused on Sayid

ON THE FIGURE in the dark as the wire is moved away and the
LIGHT BRIGHTENS

FIGURE SAYID
Where is Alex
-- I don’t -- Please --

FIGURE

Where is Alex
SAYID

(summoning his energy)
-- PLEASE just listen I’m-- I’m
a survivor of a plane crash -- I

found a wire at the beach
followed it Thought it might
have something to do with a
transmission we picked up on out

(CONTD) 12
SAYID
A recording a mayday -- a French
woman Repeating on a loop for

more than sixteen years

He stops talking ‘cause it’s still so hard to do anyway
and after a long beat he hears from the darkness

FIGURE (0S)
“Si n‘importe qui peut entendre
ceci veullez nous aider I’ lesa
tues I1 les a tues tous”

Sayid stares as the FIGURE rises slowly steps toward him and
into the light A WOMAN early forties -- attractive despite
lacking make-up swimming in a stained stretched out sweater
that hangs off her shoulder Oh yeah and she’s holding a
serious looking RIFLE looking somewhat dazed

FRENCH WOMAN
(almost to herself)
sixteen years
(beat)
Has it really been that long

SAYID stares disbelievingly He’s found her The French
Woman Alive

SAYID
You

She looks hard at him now with mounting anger
FRENCH WOMAN
You just happened to hear my
distress call Stumbled upon
it LIES No planes fly over
this island I know what you are --

She turns the rifle around in her hands

FRENCH WOMAN (CONTD)
You’re one of them

ACT TWO
INT FRENCH WOMAN’S HABITAT - MORNING 13

With sunlight streaming in through the top of the space we
finally get a look at the surroundings A dug-out hole in
the ground dirt walls mesh ceiling a ladder leaning
against one of the walls

CLOSE ON THE FRENCH WOMAN manically rifling through Sayid’s
things on a desk empty water bottle fruit a beat up copy
of the Koran an extra shirt flashlight - which she turns on
and off then she comes to the envelope of photos she
looks through them seeing pictures of the Woman in Sayid’s
flashback She compares that with the single photo she found
-- the one Sayid had looked at in the teaser She turns it
over to see SOMETHING IS HANDWRITTEN on the back - in Arabic

PAN OVER to SAYID his pant leg is ripped open his thigh is
bandaged and there’s dried blood on his chin from the rifle
butt blow ON HIS FACE as he slowly comes to and hearing
noises looks over at THE FRENCH WOMAN her back to him
going through his things unaware he’s awake

SAYID’s eyes scan across the room It’s a cluttered mess
Full of items salvaged from a ship He catches sight of

HIS POV - A TORN FADED JACKET hanging on a nail A FADED
NAME is stenciled on it ROUSSEAU

SAYID
(reading softly aloud)
“Rousseau”

Startled ROUSSEAU whips around glaring suspiciously

ROUSSEAU
How do you know my name
SAYID
I- I read it There On the
jacket
Rousseau just STARES at him An odd moment The two
studying each other Then --
SAYID (CONTD)

What is this place

ROUSSEAU
Yes What is this place

She turns away from him again to examine more of his things
LOST Solitary (PINK) 10504
(CONTD) 13

ON SAYID as he spots

HIS POV - A bank of four large batteries wires from it
running to his cot

SAYID
Those batteries They wouldn’t
produce enough power to transmit
your distress call all these years

ROUSSEAU
The transmission It broadcasts
from somewhere else
(long beat)
But they control it now

SAYID
(squinting)
“They”

ROUSSEAU
(turning and eyeing him)
You And the others like you

ON SAYID as he gets it This woman is unbalanced paranoid

SAYID
I I don’t know who you think I
am But I told you I’m not--

ROUSSEAU
“Sayid”

SAYID
What How do you --

ROUSSEAU
My name is on a jacket Yours is
on the envelope you carry
(then)
Who is she

Rousseau suddenly thrusts out the PHOTO in her hand

ROUSSEAU (CONTD)
The woman In the photographs

SAYID
That’s -- She’s no one

LOST Solitary (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 10404 18

(CONTD) 13
ROUSSEAU
You carry photos of her She means
something to you Who is she
SAYID ROUSSEAU
I don’t --
-- Tell me

Sayid looks at her a moment seeing some desperate need in
her to know Then finally replies

SAYID
Nadia Her name is Nadia

INT IRAQI BASE - HALLWAY OUTSIDE DOOR - DAY - FLASHBACK 14

CLOSE ON THE PHOTO OF NADIA clipped with some other photos
of her to an open folder (the papers all in Arabic)

OMAR (0S)
We can’t tie her directly to the
bombing

CUT OUT to see Sayid perusing the folder as Omar briefs him

OMAR (CONTD)
But we know where her sympathies
lie She’s a known associate of
Kurdish and Shi’ite insurgents

SAYID
You think she knows who
orchestrated the bombing
OMAR
That my friend is exactly what

you will find out

Omar gives Sayid a friendly slap on the shoulder and moves
off as Sayid opens the door and enters

INT IRAQ - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS - FLASHBACK A115

ON NADIA her hands tied in front of her her feet shackled
to a chair in the middle of the room Her head is down

Noor Abed Jaseem I’m going to
ask you some questions And if
you refuse to cooperate I am going

to hurt you Do you under--
She raises her head and looks at him evenly
NADIA
Nobody calls me “Noor” Sayid You
of all people should know that
Sayid stares at her a moment stunned she knows his name
NADIA (CONTD)

What you don’t remember me
(then almost wistfully)

Am I so different from the little
girl in the schoolyard who used to
push you in the mud send you

crying home to your mother

Sayid narrows his eyes as it comes to him

SAYID
Nadia
NADIA
And your mother would tell my
mother And I would be in such
trouble -- “Why must you pick on
little Sayid” and I’d answer
“Because he ignores me”
SAYID
(after a beat)
You had enough attention With
your family’s wealth And your
charms
NADIA
Such things matter little to
children

(she looks at him warmly)
But then you were always older than

your years werent you Sayid
SAYID
Not old enough to understand that

being pushed in the mud was a sign
of affection

They look at each other for a moment before Sayid realizes
his place his responsibility He breaks his gaze
SAYID (CONTD)
And now you’re a traitor to your

country

ON NADIA - disappointed with the turn in the conversation

NADIA
(bitterly)
Traitor Saddam is the traitor

And you blindly serve him like a
dog He’s betrayed his own people
brutalized murdered them --

SAYID
(cutting her off sharply)
Tell me what you know about the
bombing in Najaf

She wearily shakes her head and he leans into her

SAYID (CONTD)
You know who was behind it Tell
me -- or I swear I will hurt you

She stares hard at him

NADIA
Oh I know Sayid This isn’t my
first interrogation by the
Republican Guard

She reaches up with her bound hands and pulls away the open
collar of her shirt revealing BURN SCARS near her chest

NADIA (CONTD)
This is where they burned me with
acid When I couldn’t tell them
the whereabouts of a man I’d met
only in passing

She holds out her hands revealing small SCARS on her palms

NADIA (CONTD)
They pierced my hands with a
drill because I couldn’t
remember his name Would you
like to see the soles of my feet
Where they flagged the skin off --

Sayid stares at her wounds shaken After a beat

SAYID
If you were innocent I am sorry
(then hardening)
But this bombing is another matter

She looks away not answering

SAYID (CONTD)
Nadia --

NADIA
Go on Sayid Do your work I’m
not going to tell you anything

SAYID
(with less conviction)
I’m going to hurt you

Forty meters out this door there’s
a supply truck that will be leaving
shortly They don’t check them on
the way out only coming in Get
inside cover yourself any way you
can They won’t reach the city
for thirty minutes plenty of
time for you to jump out and hide --

Nadia REALIZES what this means Overwhelmed Then --

NADIA

SAYID
-- I can’t Desertion they

would kill my family I’m sorry
I don’t have your courage

NADIA
You have more than you know

A MOMENT Under any other circumstance it might lead to a

NADIA SEES IT - HER PHOTO protruding from the top of Sayid’s
shirt pocket A pen is clipped there as well She reaches
up and pulls out the photo

SAYID
What are you --

She says nothing as she takes his pen writes something on
the back of her photo Sayid anxiously looks around --

SAYID (CONTD)

Nadia Please You have to go
OMAR (0OS)
Sayid

OMAR approaches a look of confusion of his face

OMAR (CONTD)
What are you doing

CLOSE ON SAYID his mind reeling trying to figure out what
possible answer he could give

ON OMAR understanding now all too well what Sayid’s doing
His hand reaches down to his sidearm ON SAYID seeing that

SAYID
(quietly)
Omar Don’t --

OMAR

Sayid quickly draws his pistol and SHOOTS

OMAR is blasted back to the wall and slumps down dead ON
SAYID staring in shock Nadia behind him

NADIA
Sayid -- You have to come with me

SAYID
No You escaped stole my gun and
shot him And then you shot me

NADIA (CONTD)
Sayid
He peers up at her and holds out the gun
SAYID
Take it
(off her hesitation)

Please Nadia

Reluctantly she takes the gun from his hand replacing it
with her photo

SAYID (CONT’D)
Now go GO

Without another word she turns and runs out the door

ON SAYID hearing distant voices shouting “What was that”
“Gunfire --” He looks at Nadia’s photo then turns it over
And as he reads what she wrote --

EXT JUNGLE - DAY 31

ON ROUSSEAU as she reaches the tree behind which Sayid took
cover She hesitates for a moment then in a flash

NEW ANGLE - She steps behind it rifle poised to fire and
finds Sayid gone Before she has time to react

SAYID (0S)
Put the gun down Danielle

Come around her to find -- SAYID has gotten the drop on her
countering from the other side of the tree He’s got his
rifle trained at her head

ROUSSEAU lowers her gun and slowly turns to look at him

SAYID (CONTD)
Put it down On the ground

ROUSSEAU eyes him a moment almost sadly Then begins to
raise her gun up again

SAYID (CONTD)
Please I don’t wish to hurt you

ROUSSEAU SAYID
You already have
-- DON’T

But she ignores him RAISING HER GUN --

ON SAYID as it becomes clear what he has to do He FIRES
But nothing happens Not even the sound of the hammer

ROUSSEAU (0S)
That was his gun

Sayid looks at Rousseau her gun still trained on him
ROUSSEAU (CONT’D)
The firing pin’s been removed
Robert didn’t notice it was missing
either when I shot him

ON SAYID stunned

SAYID
You
(beat)
But you loved him
ROUSSEAU
(painfully)
He was sick
SAYID
Sick
ROUSSEAU
It took them One after the

other I I had no choice They
were already lost

SAYID
You killed them --
ROUSSEAU

What would’ve happened if we were

rescued It would’ve spread I

couldn’t let that happen
(raising her rifle)

I wont

Sayid tosses his rifle aside and glares at her

SAYID
I am not sick

She pauses staring at him her eyes welling with tears
After a beat softly --

ROUSSEAU
I know

LOST Solitary (PINK) 10504
(CONTD) SAYID
Then why kill me
ROUSSEAU
I don’t I don’t want I I

don’t know how else to stop you

The rifle drops to her side as if exhaustion has suddenly

overtaken her Tears stream down her cheeks

ROUSSEAU (CONTD)
I can’t let you go You don’t
understand To have someone to
talk to to touch

Sayid looks at her for a moment pityingly He takes a step
toward her and she swings the rifle up again Sayid halts

putting up his hands After a beat

SAYID
“You’1l find me in the next life
if not this one”

ROUSSEAU
(looking at him puzzled)
What

SAYID
The writing On the back of
Nadia’s photo

Rousseau stares at him her weapon still trained

SAYID (CONTD)
I know what it is like to hold on
to someone I’ve been holding on
for the last seven years to just a
thought A blind hope that
somewhere she is still alive

He starts to walk toward her

SAYID (CONTD)
But the more I hold on the more I
pull away from those around me I
may know in my heart that I cannot
ever let her go
(beat)
But I can’t find her alone

Sayid stands right before the rifle barrel

LOST Solitary (GREEN ) 10704 51

SAYID (CONTD)
That’s why I need to go back The
only way off this place --
Is with their help

He reaches her and takes hold of the rifle barrel Theres
a beat before she relinquishes her weapon to him and slumps
to the ground spent He lowers himself next to her

SAYID (CONTD)
Come with me We have a doctor -

She shakes her head No
SAYID (CONTD)
Danielle you have to stop
punishing yourself You don’t have
to be alone

Rousseau looks at him a moment sadly resigned

ROUSSEAU
Yes I do

She slowly gets to her feet and takes her rifle back

ROUSSEAU (CONT’D)

Your people the ones you’re
determined to return to
(pointedly)

Watch them closely
And with that she turns and starts to walk away

ON SAYID watching her go Then a question burns in him and
he calls after her

SAYID
Who is Alex

TRACKING WITH ROUSSEAU her back to him as she moves on

ROUSSEAU
Alex was my child

As she passes frame were left with SAYID staring after her
registering this new piece of the puzzle

CUT WIDE to see him standing in the jungle alone again

ACT FIVEEPILOGUE

EXT JUNGLE - CLEARING - EVENING 32

EXTREME LOW ANGLE behind the hole as a golf ball rolls
toward it bumping along the uneven ground We hear shouts
from the unseen crowd “Looks good” “Get in there” The
ball takes a sharp turn and runs past the hole

RACK FOCUS to see CHARLIE putter in his hand some ten feet
away As the crowd gives a collective “Awww”

CHARLIE

The CROWD becomes a buzz of people shouting out wagers Kate
laughs finding it all hysterical
Then from the back
SAWYER (0S)

I got two tubes of sunscreen and a

flashlight says he chokes
ON KATE as she and the others turn to see
SAWYER standing behind them looking back with uncertain
defiance There’s a long awkward moment as all the fun
dissipates with his arrival

ON JACK eyeing Sawyer as well

ON KATE recognizing the heated tension in the air but
feeling for Sawyer proud of him for making the effort

KATE
(to Sawyer)
I’ll take that action

Some in the crowd look at her as does JACK After a
moment

BOONE
Yeah me too

SHANNON
You already bet on Jack dumbass

BOONE
We can use the sunscreen princess

After a moment the tension broken people again turn back to
cheer Jack on “Let’s go Jack” “C’mon Doc”

KATE looks at Sawyer Sawyer glances at her for a moment
then turns back to watch the action

JACK sees this then looks down at his ball and lines up his
putt As his putter strikes the ball

EXT JUNGLE - LOCKE’S SPOT - MEANWHILE 33

THWAK A THROWN KNIFE imbeds itself in a tree trunk The
tree sports dozens of scars as this isn’t the first time a
knife has cut into it

LOST Solitary (PRODUCTION DRAFT) 10404 54
(CONTD) 33

WIDEN a bit as LOCKE crosses in and pries the knife out He
turns and walks back several paces readying himself to throw
it again when he stops himself sensing something and says
without turning

LOCKE
Does your father know you’re here

ARC AROUND LOCKE to find

WALT standing by the edge of the jungle behind him Though
Locke’s back is to him he answers with a shake of his head

WALT
Can you teach me how to do that

Locke lowers his arm and turns to face Walt for the first
time After eyeing him a few moments he flips the knife
over in his hand and offers the hilt out for Walt to take

ON WALT his eyes widen as he steps in toward Locke and
reaches out

CLOSE ON HIS HAND as it takes hold of the hilt and Locke lets
go

EXT JUNGLE - MEANWHILE 34
ON SAYID exhausted stumbling his way through the jungle
He’s grunting a bit but moving with purpose now using a

found tree limb as a crutchwalking stick

Suddenly he reacts to something and stops with a sharp
intake of breath holding it He listens All we HEAR is

WIND rustling through the dense thicket of trees

ON SAYID - His head darts around

HIS POV - Nothing but jungle trees being blown by the
breeze And then we hear it Amidst the sound of the
wind there’s something else Though faint it sounds like

THE WHISPERING OF VOICES seemingly all around him

And as we PUSH IN on Sayid wondering whether the wind is
playing tricks on him or There is something out there

BLACK OUT

END OF SHOW
