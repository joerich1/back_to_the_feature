Vs

PREDATOR

Screenplay by Peter Briggs
EXT DEEP SPACE

We OPEN on TOTAL BLACKNESS a sea of stars spread across the infinite
depths of space As the TITLES ROLL we notice that three of these
specks seem to be moving one of them picking up acceleration and
racing toward us Our perspective changes and we catch a quick
glimpse as it HURTLES past and into the gravitational pull of a large
brownish planet Kicking up SPARKS of FRICTION as it hits atmosphere
It seems to be manmade Or at least artificial

EXT PLANET SURFACE - DAY

The planet is dead barren Death Valley on a grand scale We watch
the object plummet through the wispy cloud-cover emitting a few last
burning embers before falling to ground way-off in the distance A
BOOMING ECHO resonates across the dusty plains before settling back
into an eerie silence

EXT FISSURE CANYON - DAY

Were looking into a deep gorge dark and sinister A howling wind
whips dust into a sandstorm reducing visibility to almost zero About
seventy feet down theres a hole in the rock-face that just might be a
cave entrance and near is a peculiar SHIMMERING in the air We hear a
mechanical BEEPING and the SHIMMERING disappears replaced by FIVE
humanoid SHAPES clinging to the sheer rock - each well over seven feet
tall They are PREDATORS a race of intergalactic big-game hunters on
permanent safari their clothing and weaponry a bizarre mix of
aborigine and ultra-hi-tech In their hands are circular metal discs
smart weapons which cut into the stone and give them purchase

PREDATOR-VISION

From their POV we see the fissure reduced to THERMAL HEAT SOURCES
The entrance registers as a black gaping void

INT FISSURE NEST TUNNEL

The five hunters climb inside the rim of the tunnel out of the winds
banshee wailing The lead PREDATOR reaches up to his headgear pulling
at the coupling pipes connecting it to a hidden breathing-apparatus

He removes the helmet clips it to his rear utility pack and takes a
deep breath of the air A curious speckled pattern runs across his
wide forehead marking him

different to the others in addition one of the fangs of his mandibles
has been sheared away Well call him BROKEN TUSK hes the leader of
the hunting party He reaches out a hand to caress the wall of the
tunnel

Several feet in from the rim it changes from rock to a textured
biomechanical surface a swirling mass of disturbing shapes He
hurries forward in response to the GURGLING-HISS of one of his team who
has found something

The other PREDATOR holds a telescopic spear up for scrutiny Skewered
on the end is a shriveled FORM with eight spindly legs and a segmented
tail its a FACEHUGGER the first stage of the deadly ALIEN lifeform
BROKEN TUSK HISSES a caution to his party they respond by pulling
spears and elaborately-shaped swords Several shoulder-mounted plasma
cannons slide up to firing position tracking with their owners
helmets Thus armed they move cautiously aheadtaking no chances
One helmeted PREDATOR pauses scanning the area

PREDATOR-VISION

He switches through a variety of different views infra-red ultra-
violet enhanced motion-tracking Nothing

Hes so pre-occupied with this task he totally fails to notice the
skeletal ALIEN loom up behind him emerging from the biomechanical
growth on the floor A barbed tail skewers the PREDATOR straight
through the neck splashing luminous blood across his chestplate A
gargled DEATH-RATTLE issues from his throat the band of PREDATORS
spinning around in time to see him being dragged below the ground The
band of extraterrestrial hunters have no time to come to his aid they
themselves are set upon by a half-dozen ALIEN WARRIORS The carnage is
swift and terrifying a blur of motion

Steel blades and serrated biomechanical limbs scythe the air alive
with the CRIES and HISSES of both adversaries One PREDATOR is pinned
against the tunnel wall his spear out of range The ALIEN claws away
his face mask and he finds himself dodging the ALIENs toothed tongue
extended toward him with pile-driver speed He reaches down grasping
the smart-weapon hanging from his belt and brings it up in an arc
that terminates at the ALIENs grinning face Big mistake The two
are in such close proximity that the ALIENs acidic blood sprays across
the PREDATORs head While their technology seems to be resistant to
it their bodies arent the viscous yellow liquid begins burning into
the PREDATORs skin He kicks the skeletal corpse away with a HIDEOUS
PIERCING SCREAM clawing at his seared face

It all seems to be over as quickly as it began there can be no
question as to who were the victors The PREDATORS stand amidst a sea
of biomechanical limbs strewn around like a charnel house As his
companions begin to carefully decapitate the ALIEN skulls BROKEN TUSK
steps over the corpses to examine his fallen comrades The first
PREDATOR to be attacked was killed instantly he crosses to the other
What he finds causes him to react with

pity and disgust His fallen comrade is only just alive mandibles
clicking frailly half his head burnt away BROKEN TUSK watches the
ailing PREDATOR slide a steel blade from its sheath and offer it to
him He takes it knowing what has to be done Rolling the knife

quickly over the back of his hand - the sort of elaborate trick
seasoned Green Berets perform - he plunges it downward into the fallen
hunter This unpleasant task accomplished

BROKEN TUSK straightens up and activates his wrist-computer A dark
shape blots out the light coming from the entrance a small PREDATOR
shuttlecraft sleek and elegant It hovers in the air with little more
than a loud HUM and extends a ramp The surviving PREDATORS leap
aboard carrying their trophies with the reserved silence of men
returning from combat

One more thing need to be done BROKEN TUSK bends down and flips a
sequence of keys on the dead PREDATORs wrist A countdown is
displayed in some unknown character-set accompanied by a HIGH PITCHED
BEEPING He then turns and swiftly boards the craft which takes
smoothly to the air its undergear retracting

EXT PLANET SURFACE - DAY

A white-hot fireball erupts out of the fissure the result of the
PREDATORs suicide-destruct mechanism The shuttlecraft pulls quickly
away disappearing into the clouds

EXT SPACE

A large spacecraft is suspended in orbit around the planet the
PREDATOR Mothership The shuttle heads swiftly towards it

INT PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - DOCKING BAY

An airlock RUMBLES open and the PREDATORS file NOISILY into the
Motherships docking bay An OLD PREDATOR crouched against a strut
takes time out from carving something into a block of wood to briefly
look up at them Like the PREDATORS themselves the ship is a curious
mixture of old and new An elaborate frieze written in alien script
runs around the wall with racks of sophisticated equipment recessed
into it Hatches lead off to various parts of the ship we see BROKEN
TUSK carry his ALIEN head off down one of them

INT PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY

The gallery seems to be more mechanical than the rest of the ship
BROKEN TUSK enters pausing next to a kind of readout device a
cylindrical tube containing a substance similar to mercury which
constantly changes its mass into shapes and alien text He peers over
the protective railing

WHAT HE SEES is magnificent a captive QUEEN ALIEN the nucleus of the
ALIEN society fed by giant intravenous pipes Each of its limbs is
tethered by straining clamps preventing any movement To the rear
its giant egg-sac glows and throbs suspended by a jury-rigged sling
A SCANNING MECHANISM hangs above the EGGS the QUEEN lays seemingly
defying gravity As each EGG is scanned by a blue triangular beam -
similar to a PREDATOR gun-sight - it becomes translucent giving us a
view of the pulsing FACEHUGGER inside This done a manipulator are
carefully loads several eggs onto a pallet which then sinks into a
hatchway in the floor Its an assembly-line of almost frightening
mechanical efficiency

EXT SPACE

We see a pod ejected from the Mothership rocketing away from the
planet into deep space The inference is obvious the PREDATORS are
seeding worlds with ALIENS to hunt

INT PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY

The blue beam slides across one of the eggs and suddenly changes to
red BEEPING rapidly BROKEN TUSK sees the flowing display-tank alter
from a rotating simulation of an ALIEN WARRIOR skull toa
representation of a QUEENs head The manipulator arm swiftly grasps
the EGG in question and moves it over to a protrusion on the floor
The causes the QUEEN to go

berserk straining at her bonds and SHRIEKING ferociously Shes
obviously been through this before and knows whats about to happen
The protrusionsplits open spilling out an intense white light an
energy-filled blast furnace The manipulator claw opens the EGG drops
in and is no more

INT PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - LIVING QUARTERS

An orange light plays across a wall of skulls casting dark shadows
into long-empty orbs BROKEN TUSK sprawls lizard-like across a flat
slab of rock in the center of the room inspecting his formidable
arsenal of weaponry Satisfied he reaches out to run a finger across
the jaw of his ALIEN trophy in an almost-erotic gesture He regards it
for a long moment as if coming to a decision of some kind before
finally getting to his feet

INT PREDATOR MOTHERSHIP - VIEWING GALLERY

The lights in the gallery are dimmer when BROKEN TUSK enters He
watches the cherry-red beam of the gliding SCANNING MECHANISM lock onto
one of the EGGS then runs his hand in sequence over the control board
The manipulator arm swings over seizing the egg and loading it onto a
waiting pallet

BROKEN TUSK points his finger at the QUEEN and makes a guttural
CLICKING SOUND from deep in his throat The effect is not unlike that
of a child firing an imaginary gun As if reading BROKEN TOOTHs
thoughts the QUEEN lifts her crested head upwards and emits a venomous
HISS of contempt

EXT SPACE

In CENTER FRAME the planet sits still and green awash with nebulous
clouds A hulking METAL FORM ROLLS RIGHT-TO-LEFT across our view
sunlight glinting from its surface Its a rectangular satellite-
construction comprised of hundreds of communication dishes in a
latticework of steel tubing We hear FILTERED HUMAN VOICES OS
Subspace chatter

EXT RYUSHI STATION - MIDDAY
Imagine a world where every square mile is covered by a canopy of
treetop foliage and youve just drawn yourself a picture of the planet
Ryushi

Nestled amongst this lush rainforest is the Yutani-Templin
Communications Relay Station Several inverted-U-shaped suspension
cranes painted bright yellow look down over a collection of
preassembled buildings and roadways raised above the swamp on
platforms much like a truncated oil-rig A navigation beacon flashes
intermittently from a tall gantry tower above while dominating the
view is the sloping face of a communications array several storeyes
high Off to one side of the platform is a gigantic many-wheeled
haulage vehicle A flock of bird-like creatures fly past

INT RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

Were in the dark womb of a split-level command center alive with
clusters of video readouts somewhat reminiscent of a futuristic air-
traffic control tower On the upper tier a large circular holo-
display currently projects an image of the satellite we just saw Thin
trailers of paper flutter gently in the current coming from the air
conditioning ducks though beads of sweat still dot the foreheads of
the people manning the consoled here We move in on CASSIE DOLLANDER
and ROB PARSONS two monitoring technicians occupying a control bank
CASSIE listens carefully to something on her headset

CASSIE

Ah negative on that request commercial freighter Nan-Shan Ive
already got an inbound on that approach pending a beacon-fix Hold on
my mark until I get back with some confirmation Rimward Traffic
Control out

She thumbs a button and leans over to PARSONS

CASSIE (CONTD)
Hows it looking

PARSONS worriedly shakes his head

PARSONS
Thats the second time I ran it and it still reads the same

CASSIE
Better tell the boss

PARSONS pulls out a coin

PARSONS
Toss you for it

INT RYUSHI STATION - EXECUTIVE OFFICE

HIROKO NOGUCHI is sweating heavily a black forelock of hair falling
across her Oriental features Her eyes flicker warily from side-to-
side as she holds the smooth length of the sword before her trying to
assess from where the next attack will come She doesnt have to wait
long two NINJA SWORDSMEN drop to the floor in front of her striking
without hesitation

She expertly avoid the blows parrying relentlessly A persistent TONE
begins to intrude 0S like a telephone RINGING She tries to ignore
it but her concentration is clearly broken A THIRD SWORDSMAN appears
from out of nowhere his sword SWISHING towards her chest The blade
plunges deep into her stomach emerging from her back She glances
down in annoyed disbelief

HIROKO
Fuck Holo off

The SWORDSMEN immediately flicker and disappear She sheathes the
sword with one precise movement and crosses the wooden paneled floor to
her desk Mopping her face with a towel she thumbs a stud The
RINGING TONE stops the corporate logo on her flat-screen desk panel
replaced with a black girls face

HIROKO (CONTD)
Noguchi

CASSIE (OS onscreen)
Something just came up on Deep Space Tracking

HIROKO
What kind of something

CASSIE (OS onscreen)
Easier if you come down and look

HIROKO
Im on my way

EXT RYUSHI STATION - MIDDAY

An eight-wheeled articulated crawler rolls noisily through the rain
climbing an access ramp leading from the swamp to the outposts empty
main-street A group of rhinos - brown two-horned quadrupeds
indigenous to Ryushi - restlessly stir in their corral at its
approach The crawlers pneumatics HISS gently as it comes to a halt
while somewhere off in the distance a dog BARKS

DON KAMEN a lean man in his forties climbs down from the cab mounted
five feet above the ground and squints up at the main relay antenna He
adjusts the cowboy hat on his head against the drizzle and crosses the
street towards one of the buildings ignoring a Pepsi sign CREAKING in
the gentle breeze A glass-paneled door SWISHES automatically open
before him

INT RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

KAMEN steps into the command center nodding familiarly to the DUTY
PERSONNEL A long-haired labrador rushes up to KAMEN wagging its
tail Her name is BREWSTER Shes the base mascot KAMEN reaches down
and ruffles its fur He climbs the few stairs to the monitoring tier
pulling the French-plaited hair of ANNIE URIOSTE an Italian systems-—
mechanic with her hands buried in a disassembled console

URIOSTE
You didnt wipe your feet coming in

KAMEN
Well its okay You didnt tell me it was monsoon season going out

PARSONS looks up at KAMEN and grins

PARSONS
Hey buenos dias cowboy When dyou blow in

KAMEN places his hat on PARSONS head and THUMPS it down

KAMEN
Just got back Missed anything

URIOSTE (snorts)
Yeah Were almost out of beer

PARSONS
Ahh dont pay any attention to Urioste Shes still pissed that
Noguchi wouldnt let her go off on your hunting trip

KAMEN pours himself a cup of coffee from a BUBBLING percolator

KAMEN

Wasnt my trip I just did the driving Sides freezing my butt off
out in the wet taking pot-shots at the local wildlife isnt my idea of
a good time either

He sips gingerly from the cup of scalding liquid

PARSONS
Whered you leave them

KAMEN
Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linsons Range Theyre making
their own way back tomorrow

CASSIE
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones

KAMEN
Shit When

CASSIE
Yesterday We got the Network feed from Gateway it was the top story
on Sixty Seconds Biggest market crash since twenty-four

KAMEN looks ill

KAMEN
Fucking great I invested some money in them

CASSIE
You win some you loose some

KAMEN
I lose em all thats why Im still out here on this rock Anything
else you wanna ruin my day with

CASSIE
No but I got something that might interest you

HIROKO enters pulling on a leather jacket

HIROKO
Whatve you got

KAMEN nods to her and receives a quick smile for his trouble They
turn to watch the display clear replaced with a computer simulation of
the neighboring solar system

CASSIE
A pair of incomings They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen
twenty-four local time

PARSONS
We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly but we ran a back-trace just
to make sure

CASSIE
Yeah Turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace

The simulation ZOOMS IN revealing two unidentified objects heading
towards the planet in the center of the display Computer notations
accompany them

CASSIE (CONTD)
Curious thing is the mass detector says theyre too small to carry a
deep-space drive

HIROKO
Sounds like a couple of escape shuttles

PARSONS
Thats what we thought

HIROKO
Have you got an updated Lloyds Almanac to cross-reff them through

PARSONS
Done it already Nothing matches

CASSIE
And if you thought that was interesting watch this

HIROKO watches the course of the two objects simultaneously change

KAMEN
Jesus
PARSONS
Yeah exactly Thosere pre-programmed course adjustments youre
looking at

KAMEN
Tactical nukes maybe

Everybody gives him a quick look but nobody says anything Its
obviously not an appealing thought

HIROKO
Wherere they headed

CASSIE
We ran a trajectory simulation If they carry on along that path its
possible theyll make intra-orbital insertion

Theres a great exhalation of breath and everyone swaps significant
glances HIROKO seems worried She scratches her forehead

HIROKO

I dont know what to make of this Get a copy of the telemetry relayed
back to Antarctica Traffic Control Better alert the nearest RimCorp
Base too

PARSONS nods suddenly serious

PARSONS
Fort Powell What do we tell em

HIROKO
Just give them the facts They can leap to their own conclusions

EXT LINSONS RANGE - SWAMP - AFTERNOON

Down here in the swamp the trunks of magnificent trees terminate in
gnarled roots and disappear into watery murk much like a Louisiana
bayou A group of attentive LEMUR-TYPE CREATURES suddenly bound for
cover as a line of bullets THUDS into the wood nearby Seconds later
a loud HUMMING NOISE intrudes OS and a pair of manta-ray-shaped
hover-bikes with sleek lines and garnish decals SLAMS into FRAME
suspended two feet above the mire their powerful turbines kicking-up a
swirl of spray The two BIKERS skid to a halt and watch the CREATURES
scatter ACKLAND and YORK - men who on Earth might be called good ol

boys - are both riding one-handed powerful hi-tech rifles gripped in
the other
YORK (yelling)

You missed em Ackland

ACKLAND
Little fuckers move too fast Lets do a sweep and catch ‘em on the
other side

YORK nods his head pulling his goggles down over his eyes The two
bikes ROAR off in pursuit
EXT LINSONS RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - AFTERNOON

Up on a mud-bank at the base of a sturdy gantry tower with two
blinking blue lights atop it stands the camp It looks a little like
a Bedouin bivouac but up-close we can see the techno-fitted details

A hard-featured woman seated next to a solid-fuel burner sips froma
mug while her Vietnamese counterpart is manually loading large-caliber
bullets into a belt-feed They

watch as ACKLAND and YORK roar past WHOOPING MINH scrambles out of
the way as a beer can lobbed by YORK CLATTERS to the ground near him

MINH
Crazy idiots

BEAUVAIS cups her drink with both hands assessing him

BEAUVAIS

Ahhh theyre just letting off some steam dont let ‘em get to you
Ackland and York arent such bad guys when you get to know em Just a
couple of weekend warriors

She peers curiously at the clunky cartridges MINHs thumbing into the
belt feed On the ground next to him is a widebore weapon on an over-
the-shoulder guidance mechanism

BEAUVAIS (CONTD)
Nice howitzer youve got there

MINH
Thanks

BEAUVAIS
Good argument for gun-control What are you going after rhino

MINH

Nah I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds Sides they tagged the
rhinos for the migration project so theyre protected Theyll dock
you a months pay for just mentioning it

He peers into the belt and blows out some dirt

MINH (CONTD)
Sure wish there was something on this planet with a bit of fight in it
though

EXT DEEP SPACE

Against a sea of stars a small metal shape HURTLES towards us
followed moments later by its identical twin

EXT RYUSHI STATION - BIG BERTHA - AFTERNOON

A strand of HIROKOs hair falls forward into her face slick with rain
She brushes up at the miserable weather She and KAMEN are standing on
one of the twelve-feet-in-diameter wheels of the gargantuan haulage

vehicle we saw outside the base earlier Up on the side of the cab is
painted a Nordic Valkyrie with an impressive bustline next to which is
the legend BIG BERTHA Two mechanics JAN GUTTIEREZ and KEVIN
DILLER watch KAMEN point something out to HIROKO from the vantage
point of KAMENs crawler parked in the swamp nearby

KAMEN

See that sheathing on the suspension Eaten away Same thing with the
pumps on the base air purifiers The algae out here just isnt good on
these new plastics

HIROKO

We havent used Big Bertha since we relocated the generator module
That was four months ago I cant ask for them to keep bringing spares
in on the shuttle its already costing too much as it is

KAMEN shrugs

KAMEN
If you want these things kept in working condition thats the only
choice youve got

DILLER leans in to murmur quietly to GUTTIEREZ

DILLER
Maybe she wouldnt be so tetchy if she got laid every once-in-a-while

GUTTIEREZ
You offering

A buzzer inside the crawler goes OFF DILLER gets up to answer

DILLER
Nah Freeze my dick off

HIROKO shakes her head dubiously at KAMENs comment

HIROKO

I dont know I think well have to run it on a rota one month down
one month operational

DILLER leans out of the crawlers cab and calls across

DILLER
Miss Noguchi Youre wanted in admin

HIROKO
Thanks

She turns back to KAMEN

HIROKO (CONTD)
Let me sort this out and well go over the logistics in my office

INT RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

HIROKO peers at the display with undisguised concern A sense of
urgency buzzes around the room
HIROKO (CONTD)
When

CASSIE

Seven minutes ago the third course change in an hour Those incomings
are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too
close for comfort

HIROKO
Can we move it to a different orbit in time

PARSONS looks up from his board in harassment

PARSONS
Already working on it

HIROKO
Get off an all-bands emergency distress and put it on a repeater

She meets KAMENs eyes

HIROKO (CONTD)

Looks like you were right Someones lobbed a pair of smart-missiles
at us

KAMEN shakes his head

KAMEN

Relay station like us out in the middle of the boonies why bother
All youre gonna do is punch a temporary hole in the traffic control
net Thatd be small potatoes even for terrorists

PARSONS and CASSIE are all-business at the control board

PARSONS
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS

CASSIE
Okay give me the numbers

She flips a switch A nearby screen changes to display an orbital path
sketched out in rectangular neon blocks

EXT SPACE

A cluster of thruster rockets on one corner of the relay frame ignites
and the darkened bulk of the satellite begins to move

EXT DEEP SPACE
The two pods ROAR towards us at immense speed
INT RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

The two blips on the holo-board representing the pods make a marked
alteration in their course
PARSONS
Theyve changed their heading again

HIROKO
Compensate

PARSONS
Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee

CASSIE
What do you need

PARSONS
A three-second burn to port on my mark

CASSIE
Its on the board

EXT SPACE

Framed against the green backdrop of Ryushi the PREDATOR pods rocket
towards the communications platform

CASSIE
Picking up velocity

HIROKO
Match it

A bead of sweat trickles down PARSONS temple

PARSONS
Not gonna make it

EXT DEEP SPACE
The pod speeds THUNDEROUSLY into CAMERA blotting out our view
INT RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

One of the two blips on the holo-display vanishes and three-quarters
of the monitors abruptly turn to static PARSONS curses

PARSONS
Goddammit

He pulls off his headset with weary resignation

PARSONS (CONTD)
Weve lost the downlink Its gone

EXT SPACE

The mass of the satellite tumbles end-over-end A gaping rent is torn
through it something sparks and flashes within The second pod
accelerates off curving into the atmosphere
EXT LINSONS RANGE - RIVERBANK - DUSK

A SONIC THUNDERCRACK BOOMS overhead YORK looks up in time to see an
object sear across the dusk sky He pulls his bike to a stationary
hover

YORK
Shit Whats that

ACKLAND has already dismounted as he watches the fireball hurtle to the
ground A BOOMING ECHO resonates across the forest followed by a few
plaintive SCREECHES from the planets indigenous lifeforms before
settling back into an eerie silence

ACKLAND
Meteor I guess

He raises a set of compact field binoculars to his face THROUGH THEM
he sees a thin haze of smoke rising from the treetops

ACKLAND
Dyou feel any impact shock

YORK (uncertain)
Not really

He lowers the binoculars and frowns

ACKLAND

Me either I tell you I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto
and when something like that hits believe me you know about it
YORK

Do you wanna head back and call it in

ACKLAND (hesitant)
I dunno I dunno Something about this feels funny

He looks across at the plume of smoke snaking off into the sky

ACKLAND (CONTD)
That is the damndest impact Ive ever saw

EXT LINSONS RANGE - IMPACT SIGHT - DUSK

The earth around the crater-rim is charred and cracked some of the
surrounding brush still aflame A SCORPION scuttles inquisitively to
the edge of the pit and stops its stinger twitching hesitantly We
HEAR a LOW HUM and the SOUND of METAL-ON-METAL Before the SCORPION
can decide what to do its fate is sealed A large METAL CLAW comes
down crushing it in an instant A SECOND CLAW emerges and a MACHINE
heaves itself out of the hole its surface smoking with heat It
pauses for a BEAT like some giant tarantula seeking prey them moves
purposely outwards about twenty yards before halting A hatch on the
underside opens and a complex delivery mechanism extends After a
moment theres a LOW CLUNK and the mechanism retracts In its place
is an ALIEN EGG The MACHINE crawls off vanishing into the long
reeds
EXT RYUSHI STATION - NIGHT

HIROKO sits on the front wheel of KAMENs crawler her knees pulled up
to her chin staring off into a thin mist that makes the night
impenetrable Behind and above the lights of the cranes and the
communications array strobe on-and-off Above the bar on the main
street is a flicking neon sign erected after-the-fact emblazoned with
the words TORCHYS The MUFFLED SOUNDS of MERRY-MAKING from within
become momentarily louder and HIROKO glances over to see its
pressure-door CRASH back disgorging several drunken people KAMEN
follows them through He spots HIROKO and heads over

KAMEN
Hey boss Wondered where youd gotten to

HIROKO
I just wanted to be put on my own for a while Clear my head

KAMEN
Didnt feel like whoopin it up with the rest of us blue collars huh

She shakes her head and manages a smile

HIROKO
Ive got a lot of thinking to do Sides the room was getting too
crowded for me

KAMEN
Not too much of the socializing type then

HIROKO
No not really More sort of the claustrophobic type

KAMEN LAUGHS HIROKO is straight-faced

HIROKO (CONTD)
Im serious Thats why I switched from orbiting to planetary
installations

KAMEN
Is that a fact

HIROKO
Uh-huh Used to get it pretty bad Id wake up in a cold sweat and
want to claw open a vacuum hatch

KAMEN
How long you been out here for now anyway Three months

HIROKO
Four

KAMEN
And before that
HIROKO
Six month stint on Datus

KAMEN
Only six

HIROKO
What is this Twenty Questions

KAMEN
Just curious Theres a lot of talk goes around

HIROKO shrugs Thinks about it

HIROKO
I dont know I guess Ive just never found anywhere I really felt at
home

She hugs her knees again and suddenly looks a whole lot more at ease
KAMEN spots a square glass balanced on one of the tires wide treads

KAMEN
What is that

HIROKO
Real man drink

She offers the glass to him He takes it and sniff cautiously

KAMEN
Seltzer

HIROKO
Want some

KAMEN hands the glass back and raises his own bottle

KAMEN
Ill stick with my own

He sits with her and stares into the darkness

HIROKO
Any luck raising Acklands party

KAMEN
Nothing With the satellite down we cant transmit over the mountain
range Hes most likely sitting there wondering why he cant raise us

HIROKO
First light well take a chopper out there and tell them to head back

KAMEN
We You wanna fly out there with me

HIROKO
Sure Do me good to stretch my legs
HIROKO takes a sip of her drink her brow furrowing

HIROKO (CONTD)
This whole things got me spooked

KAMEN hops off the wheel

KAMEN

Dont worry about it If the Network goes by the book like everyone
figures they will a Marine gunboat from Powellll drop-by for a look-
see in four-or-five days They can go poke around out there and find
whatever it was hit us All weve gotta do is sit tight

HIROKO
Do you think Acklandll sit tight

KAMEN
Thered have to be a helluva good reason for him not to

EXT SPACE

A peculiar blue scanning beam plays over the rotating mass of the
incapacitated satellite examining every section it comes to the rent
torn through it and pauses

FROM THE SCANNERS POV we see the structure of the satellite made
up from a series of blue geodesic shapes The damage registers as a

cold black mass

The beam switches off and the hovering PREDATOR shuttle turns smoothly
on its axis thrusting towards the planet

EXT LINSONS RANGE - IMPACT SITE - NIGHT

Shafts of torch-light fan out above the thick foliage in the darkness
YORK and ACKLAND wade through the chin-high reeds cursing

ACKLAND
Found anything

YORK looks down at his data-stick a handheld torch with a multi-
purpose readout screen

YORK

Nada No radiation no movement nothing

ACKLAND

Well just keep looking Its gotta be whoa Jesus

ACKLAND falls toward onto something and YORK comes running

YORK
What is it

ACKLAND steadies himself and the two men shine their torches at the
rhythmically-breathing SHAPE on the ground
ACKLAND
Its a rhino

YORK
Is it dead

ACKLAND
No its still breathing Kinda clammy though Are you sure your
sticks not broken

YORK looks at the data-stick again

YORK
Yeah its fine

ACKLAND
God I hope that thing didnt bring down a virus

YORK
I told you we whats that

Their torch beams PAN ACROSS a three-foot high ovular shape

ACKLAND
Looks like a spore Fungus of some kind maybe

YORK
Bloody big if it is Tops open

ACKLAND steps cautiously forward to shine his torch inside

YORK (CONTD)
Careful

Theres nothing inside ACKLAND looks disappointed

ACKLAND
Its hollow Think our rhino mustve ate something that didnt agree
with him

A heavy gust of air blows unexpectedly across the clearing with a
BANSHEE HOWL ruffling their hair

YORK
Lets get back and call this in

ACKLAND
Wait a minute

YORK reluctantly follows ACKLAND as he thrashes through the thinn ing
foliage coming out at the rim of the impact crater Its beginning to
partially collapse water seeping in YORK runs his beam over
something at the bottom of the shallow pit

YORK
What is that is that metal fragments
ACKLANDs maybe getting a little nervous now

ACKLAND
This is very fucking weird

He sees the churned earth and the muddy trail leading off into the
broken foliage

ACKLAND (CONTD)
Its like something came out of the crater and went that way

Theres a TINY CLICK and ACKLAND looks over to see YORK taking the
safety off his rifle ACKLAND wordlessly unshoulders his too They
step around the crater and warily follow the ragged path to

YORK
Another one

ACKLAND prods this SECOND EGG with his gun

ACKLAND
Yeah Thiss closed

Theres a CRACKLING NOISE and the top of the EGG peels neatly open in
four sections The two men jump back in alarm and YORK LAUGHS
nervously Something organic is pulsing inside ACKLAND cranes his
neck forward for a better look

Theres an EXPLOSION of MOVEMENT A spindly shape with a long
segmented tail launches itself jack-in-a-box-style at ACKLAND Its a
FACEHUGGER ACKLAND trips backwards caught off-balance His finger
involuntarily squeezes the trigger of his rifle as he falls A volley
of shots describe and arc and light up the night with a PERCUSSIVE
BOOM and we

CUT TO

A SHORT DISTANCE ACROSS THE CLEARING SOMETHING is watching them
from the trees something with a heat-vision POV A PREDATOR We
see the flare of ACKLANDs gunshots then SNAP IN to see the multi-
colored from of his body toppling over trailing a purplish FACEHUGGER
before we

CUT BACK TO

One of ACKLANDs bullets taking a meaty chunk out of YORKs thigh as
he races forward to help his friend The HUGGERs tail is already
around ACKLANDs throat its fingers scrabbling for purchase YORK
pulls at one set of digits and manages to raise them for just an
instant What we see is horrific the look of terror on ACKLANDs
face and the questing tendril on
the HUGGERs underside trying to force its way between ACKLANDs lips
In a second its all over the FACEHUGGER struggles free of YORKs
grasp and clamps itself firmly on ACKLANDs face with a faint SUCKING
SOUND YORK shivers then uses his good leg to propel himself a few
feet away He watches the hapless Teamster go rigid then stop moving
altogether
YORK
Oh God oh shit oh God

The FACEHUGGERs tail slithers tighter around ACKLANDs neck and as
YORK quickly retrieves his rifle we

CUT TO

A PREDATOR-VISION SHOT watching the color-bloom of YORK dragging
ACKLANDs body away from the crater It CLOSES IN on the FACEHUGGER
giving us a muted X-ray-type VIEW of circulatory fluid pumping around
the HUGGER and into ACKLAND

YORKs limping badly a dark stain blossoming on his baggy fatigue
trousers ACKLANDs not a small man and the physical effort of hauling
him through the reeds makes him sweat profusely Theres movement on
the ground and YORK sees why one of the LEMURS has fallen victim to
another FACEHUGGER which dwarfs its small furry body The HUGGERs
fingers all ripple simultaneously as it strengthens its hold the
movement akin to somebody drumming their

fingers on a table-top

EXT LINSONS RANGE - RIVER BANK - NIGHT

As YORK hauls ACKLAND onto one of the bikes he hears a TICKING SOUND
from the trees like an engine cooling on a warm summers day YORK
clutches his rifle and stares upward There seems to be a VAGUE
SHIMMERING FORM in the bough of a tree Although it might be a trick
of the light he isnt sticking around to find out YORK guns the bike
to life and ROARS off above the swamp

EXT LINSONS RANGE - IMPACT SITE - NIGHT

PREDATOR-VISION

Were looking at the site in colours the cold blue of empty ALIEN
EGGS and the warm reds of just-breathing ANIMALS rendered inert the
FACEHUGGER parasites

A group of PREDATORS appear in three-dimensional solidity their
camouflage cloaks deactivated The LEAD PREDATOR SPLASHES across to
the exposed roots of a tree and kneels down to examine an ANIMAL CORPSE
curled up there Most of it has been madly mutilated by something
erupting from inside its body The PREDATOR looks up and scans the
swamp ignoring the swarm of FLIES buzzing in the air

PREDATOR-VISION

This time an oscillating line appears to the left of our view anda
band sweeps quickly ACROSS the screen synchronous to us hearing
different levels of SOUND STATIC This abruptly stops as the
oscillating line begins to moves in peaks and valleys The PREDATOR is
picking up radio

waves A HUMAN VOICE albeit grossly-distorted

EXT LINSONS RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT
We hear a RAPID BEEPING movement-sensors set up on tripods to warn

against intruding animals The sound brings BEAUVAIS out of her tent
bleary-eyed and fumbling with her pistol Shes suddenly wide awake
when she sees YORKs hover-bike lit by the sensors flashing red
strobe It skids to a halt against a mud-bank sending up a spray of
silt YORK climbs off the bike and stumbles then starts to unfasten
the straps holding ACKLANDs body

BEAUVAIS
Jesus Christ What happened

YORK
Give me a hand with Ack

She races over to help YORK ease ACKLAND up

BEAUVAIS
How bad is oh my God

As ACKLAND is turned over BEAUVIAS gets her first look at a
FACEHUGGER She shies away repulsed

BEAUVAIS
What is that

YORK
Dont uuh dont know Help me uuh help me get him inside
Shit

YORK grits his teeth but the leg injury is too painful He slumps
slowly to the floor

BEAUVAIS (yelling)
Minh Minh get out here

INT TENT - NIGHT

A portable neon light in the tent flickers casting staccato bluish
light over ACKLAND and the FACEHUGGER MINH and BEAUVAIS stare at it
in horrified fascination while YORK pulls a tourniquet around his
thigh He winces

BEAUVAIS
Have you tried prising it off

YORK shakes his head

YORK
I wanted to get him back here get him back to base

MINH
Forget it We lost the satellite link Its dead

Theres a long pause while everyone considers the options

BEAUVAIS
Weve got no option Were gonna have to get it off

MINH
Oh man
YORK
Get real Beauvais That thing might chew his fucking face off for all
be know

The motion sensor outside begins BEEPING again MINH catches BEAUVAIS
head-jerk

BEAUVAIS
Minh

MINH
Yep

MINH hefts his howitzer and leaves the tent BEAUVAIS rounds on
YORK continuing

BEAUVAIS
How do you know its not already

YORK
I dont but I think we should just wait and let the Doc take a look

EXT LINSONS RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

MINH walks towards a line of flashing red strobes at the perimeter of
the camp the barrel of his weapon pointing casually forward He
studies the surrounding darkness Theres nothing out there He
shakes his head in

disgust

MINH (muttering)
Take a goddamn wrench to those things

He thumbs a stud on the top of the howitzer Theres a gentle WHINE
and the HISS of hydraulic cylinders as the harness mechanism lifts the
weapon up It darts quickly to-and-fro a mechanical snake seeking a
target We see MINHs hand in CLOSE UP In addition to the firing
trigger theres also a thumb button He squeezes it

The gun swings sharply around in a blinding movement tracking
something automatically Theres a THUNDEROUS RUMBLE as it fires-off
three shots in rapid succession Something that was only yards from
MINH APPEARS and is blown backwards to CRASH against a tree bole a
mass of luminous green liquid and motion

MINH (CONTD) (dumbstruck)
God

MINH watches the helmeted PREDATOR fall face down into the water with a
SPLASH then lie motionless YORK and BEAUVAIS are out of the tent in
an instant

PREDATOR-VISION
Three humans in motion and hot The triangular mechanism of the
PREDATORs gun locks onto MINH
A BLAST of plasma-energy rips a gaping hole through MINHs body
spraying blood across YORK He topples dead to the ground a look of
pained surprise on his face BEAUVAIS is there immediately racing
across and scrabbling for the howitzer She doesnt have time to
take the harness off - she just slides her finger through the trigger
guard and starts squeezing off random shots The air shimmers as an
unseen shape races at her Theres a loud

SWISH of sliding metal and a telescopic spear appears out of thin air
It SLAMS through BEAUVAIS body lifting her off the ground and
impaling her against a tree

YORK watches in horror as BEAUVAIS arms thrash around A moment later
her struggles cease and shed dropped to the floor like a broken
marionette Theres a CRACKLING SOUND and the hazy air around BEAUVAIS
disappears In its place is a PREDATOR a luminous green patch
trickling from a wound on its arm Its head flicks around as it
zeroes-in on YORK the three red dots of the PREDATORs cannon
following suit YORKs quick though already up and running when the
plasma bolt EXPLODES into the tree despite the pain in his leg

His options are limited The hover-bike is nearby He sprints for
that and his luck holdsthe keys still in the ignition He flips
it The engine COUGHS and then dies YORK looks up The wounded
PREDATOR bounds across the clearing at frightened speed YORK turns
the key again but the PREDATORs almost upon him The creature WHIPS
an ornately-shaped lance from its back and thrusts itJUST AS THE
ENGINE ROARS TO LIFE AND THE HOVER-BIKE RISES FROM THE MUD The blade
slices into the bikes body and jams there while one of its manta-
wings SMACKS into the PREDATORs jaw sending it reeling backwards into
the swamp

YORK swivels the bike on its axis as another plasma-bolt rips into the
rear melting away a sizable chunk of the bodywork He sees a PREDATOR
handing from a tree and the SHIMMERING of two more PREDATORS in their
camouflage nearby Hes not sticking around to argue though YORK
jams the throttle hard and the bike shoots off into the bayou as more
cannon-blasts blossom around him

The group of PREDATORS appear in the camp and cautiously survey the
area The LEAD PREDATOR - the one with the distinctive armor - crosses
to the tent and opens the entry flap

INT TENT - NIGHT

PREDATOR-VISION

The extraterrestrial hunter scrutinizes the pulsing FACEHUGGER on
ACKLAND for a long moment but takes no further action

EXT LINSONS RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

We PAN SLOWLY ACROSS the deserted campsite There isnt a soul there
human or otherwise The wind whistles eerily through the tree-boughs

EXT RAINFOREST AIRSPACE - DAWN

First light the next day the sun rising on the horizon A chopper -
actually a twin-turbine heli-jet - flies in low above the veil of mist
hanging over the treetops

INT CHOPPER - DAWN

The cockpit is small a two-seater with room for cargo in the back
KAMENs in the pilot seat and HIROKOs riding shotgun The controls
moving by themselves on autopilot A REPETITIVE BEEPING causes KAMEN
to look up from his magazine

KAMENS POV
From out of the window of the chopper we see the twin blue lights of
the navigation beacon blinking on-and-off above the trees

KAMEN nudges HIROKO awake

KAMEN
Wake up Were at the beacon

He switches the controls over to manual and takes the chopper down
HIROKO rubs the sleep from her eyes

EXT LINSONS RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - DAWN

Twin searchlights on the underside of the descending chopper sweep
across the clearing The encampment has been wrecked much of is
reduced to a twisted tangle of smoking debris All-terrain gear lowers
from the chopper as it makes a watery landing in the swamp

INT CHOPPER - DAWN

KAMEN and HIROKO stare at the site in disbelief KAMEN hauls an
automatic pulse-rifle from the rear

KAMEN
Looks like trouble

KAMEN reaches under the pilots seat and pulls out a hand-pistol
Passes it to her

KAMEN (CONTD)
Used one of these before

HIROKO coolly examines it

HIROKO

Fabrique Nationale tactical autoloader Uses twelve mill hollow 0
rounds with through the barrel smart laser-sighting Sure I can
handle this

HIROKOs show-boating and KAMEN knows it but he still cant help being
a little bit impressed

KAMEN
Okay Watch were you point it

EXT LINSONS RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - DAWN
The two of them pick their way across mangled tripods and charred
canvas Part of the bivouac has collapsed - one of the guide ropes has
burned through

HIROKO (quietly)
Somebody picked an argument

KAMEN
Yeah Somebody won

HIROKO
Check out the tent

KAMEN nods and heads off that way while HIROKO carefully inspects the
wreckage dotted around the perimeter

INT TENT - DAWN

KAMEN opens the tent flap and peers inside ACKLANDs on the cot
sweating heavily There is no sign of the FACEHUGGER

EXT LINSONS RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - DAWN

Across the clearing HIROKO turns a piece of charred plating over in
her hands before discarding it

Her foot slips on an object sunk into the soft mud Its MINHs
howitzer A dark slippery patch coats the metal She crouches down
and rubs her fingers through it Blood KAMENs VOICE intrudes OS

KAMEN (OS)
Ive found Ackland

HIROKO
Hold on

She begins to cross the camp and her foot catches on a taut length of
rope SOMETHING swings down from the trees hitting her squarely in the
face and knocking her off her feet HIROKO CRIES OUT in fear and
surprise then freezes at what she sees

Two bloodied bodies dangle head-first from the bough overhead BEAUVAIS
and MINH Each has been skinned and is beyond recognition KAMEN
hears her exclamation and is out of the tent in an instant He stops
in his tracks

KAMEN
Jesus palomino

EXT RYUSHI STATION - HELI-JET PAD - MORNING

Its raining again at the base Under cover of an overhang HIROKO
watches as ACKLAND is trundled away from the chopper on a paramedic
trolley by GUTTIEREZ and DOC REVNA an Indian woman in her late
thirties As KAMEN slams the choppers side door we see that HIROKO
has left her leather jacket on the passenger seat KAMEN runs after
REVNA clutching a clear plastic bag

KAMEN
Wait a minute Doc

He hands the bag over to REVNA She peers at the contents curiously
The FACEHUGGER is inside stiff and shriveled

REVNA
Is this it

KAMEN
Yeah Found it curled up in a corner of the tent Any idea

REVNA shakes her head

REVNA
Never come across one of these before Maybe the original survey team
did Ill run it through records and see what comes up

GUTTIEREZ checks that ACKLANDs bodys secure on the trolley KAMEN
raps him on the back to get his attention

KAMEN
Hey Jan See if you can get someone to check out the chopper

GUTTIEREZ
Whats the problem

KAMEN
She was running a little sluggish on the way back Think the turbines
might be playing up

GUTTIEREZ
Give me twenty minutes and Ill do it myself

KAMEN
Appreciate that

REVNA interrupts

REVNA
Wherere the bodies

HIROKO
Bagged and in the back Theyre not a pretty sight

ACKLAND is wheeled into a freight elevator As KAMEN and HIROKO walk
away across the rain-swept platform a SHIMMERING FROM detaches itself
from the rear of the chopper and lowers itself to the heli-jet pad

A newly-arrived PREDATOR scans the towers and modules of the relay-
station with great interest An oscillating red line appears to the
LEFT of the SHOT as the PREDATOR analyses HIROKOs voice-pattern

still-smoking ALIEN skulls Two and empty

hands in admiration This PREDATOR thrusts his trophy onto the next

With nothing to do most of the screens are out and the remaining
personnel bored PARSONS is reading a magazine with his feet up on the

something thisll be treated as first degree murder

Agreed

HIROKO
When we get the link back and I send this in ICCll throw a fit

KAMEN
Ah dont worry about ICC Theyre the least of your problems right
now

What do you mean

URIOSTE walks up very serious She interrupts

URIOSTE
Sorry Can I have a word

HIROKO
Sure Whats up

URIOSTE
Three-Pump failed a half-hour ago The algae must have clogged up an
intake duct

KAMEN
Think I spoke too soon

HIROKO
Again How long before we start noticing the difference

I reckon itll be another day before the smell gets unbearable
Beauvais usually fixes it but ah

HIROKO knows what she means BEAUVAIS is dead

HIROKO
Can you handle it

URIOSTE
Sure I can manage But Im not going into the Pit on my own

Alright get somebody from the auto-shop (to Kamen) Is that
alright

consciousness but is far from happy Hes sitting on the edge of a
cot in the base Infirmary an antiseptic room full of automated medical
equipment The Autodoc is suspended from the ceiling nearby a
circular cluster of sophisticated manipulator arms tipped with cutting
blades and surgical paraphernalia

ACKLAND
Hey cmon Doc I feel fine Really

Forget that I want you off alcohol for at least seventy-two hours
Ive got some toxin build-up tests still to run

What happened out there Ack

ACKLAND (consternated)
What do you mean what happened What am I doing back here Wheres

We watched a meteor hit over Linsons

HIROKO and KAMEN exchange significant glances

A meteor

ACKLAND

Yeah it impacted really off We went out to the crash-site and
uh thats thats all

KAMEN

Nothing else

ACKLAND
No

KAMEN turns to REVNA

KAMEN
Show him Fido

REVNA pulls out a cylindrical glass stasis tube from a wall rack She
hands it to ACKLAND He studies the dead FACEHUGGER floating inside
with morbid fascination

REVNA
Ring any bells

ACKLAND tries hard to think but its as if a walls slammed down hard
on his mind

ACKLAND
Not really no Ugly little sonuvabitch What is it

Yorks vanished

ACKLAND
Vanished

HIROKO

Beauvais and Minh are dead Ackland Yorks gone awol unless you can
help us go some way toward disproving our suspicion hes the prime
suspect right now

Do you believe him

HIROKO

Ackland I dont know him well enough to say If we were back on

Theres not much we can do out here

KAMEN stares hard at her Thats not much of an answer and HIROKO
knows it She capitulates

HIROKO (CONTD)
Alright then For what its worth yes I do

KAMEN digs appreciatively into a container of food with his fork

KAMEN
You should try this seasoned stuff Its good

GUTTIEREZ approaches the table carrying something

A metal rail surrounds the perimeter of the platform DILLER leans
against it down by the access ramp smoking a cigarette and idly
blowing rings into the air BREWSTER pricks up her years and begins to
quietly SNARL DILLER glances down at her curiously

DILLER
Whats the matter girl You smell something

Now the rhino are restless too CASSIE walks across the concrete
roadway to join them

CASSIE
Rhinos look a little antsy

BREWSTER stops SNARLS and progresses onwards to full-fledged BARKING

DILLER
Yeah Never seem em act like this before

CASSIE and DILLER are warm but the rhinos are BREWSTER are ‘hotter
still Their VOICES and BREWSTERs BARKS are filtered to the point of
unrecognizability eerily distorted

CASSIEs the first to hear the SOUND

CASSIE
Do you hear that

DILLER straightens up looking out into the surrounding trees Its a
FAINT HUM getting LOUDER every second

DILLER
Yeah

A hoverbike appears trailing smoke from one of its turbine intakes as
it hurtles towards the base Halfway between the trees and the ramp
it clips a fallen log and spins end-over-end Its rider flies through
the air and hits the swamp face-first DILLER and CASSIE race down the
ramp with BREWSTER YELPING excitedly in the lead
CASSIE
I dont believe it

DILLER splashes through the swamp and pulls the limp body out of the
mire Its YORK Blood has caked around his wounded leg

DILLER
He looks in a bad way Help me get him up to Infirmary

CASSIE
Wait a minute

Something else has caught CASSIEs eye A something almost two
metres in length protruding from the rear of the wrecked hoverbike
Grasping the haft firmly she works it free CASSIE examines the
PREDATOR spear and slowly shakes her head

CASSIE (CONTD)
Holy Mary

The concealed hunter watches as the colorised human curiously turns the
weapon over in her hands

INT RYUSHI STATION - INFIRMARY

REVNA sits at a desk and peers into a microscope Every so often she
GRUNTS in satisfaction and types something into her computer terminal
The stasis tube containing the dead FACEHUGGER stands to one side of
the computer screen The Infirmary is very quiet and only the gentle
THROB of the air-conditioning intrudes ACKLAND tosses uncomfortably
on his cot He finally sits up and massages his chest

ACKLAND
Oh Oh God

REVNA lowers her pen and looks across

REVNA
What is it

ACKLAND
Its nothing Doc Just a touch of indigestion something

REVNA
Do you want a tablet

ACKLAND winces in pain His breathings getting heavy He nods

ACKLAND
Uh-huh

REVNA gets up swiftly and crosses to an automated pharmacy ACKLANDs
beginning to COUGH now

REVNA
That sounds nasty Ill give you a couple of Demazine
ACKLAND nods again His COUGHING has deepened and now hes banging
his chest with a balled fist REVNA hurries over with three red
tablets and a disposable cup of water ACKLAND takes them gratefully
and gulps them down The effect is almost immediate ACKLAND quietens
and an appreciative smile comes to his pale lips

REVNA (CONTD)
Better

ACKLAND
Yeah

Before he has a chance to elaborate ACKLAND COUGHS once more A thin
spray of blood and saliva dots REVNAs white smock and speckles her
cheek ACKLANDs scrabbling fingers grab her lapels as he begins to
hyperventilate She pulls away dragging him from the bed in the
process He falls to the floor his MOANS growing in volume

REVNA
Hold on its alright Im gonna give you a shot

Her fingers tremble as she clumsily examines a tray of surgical
instruments She finds a pneumatic spray-injector fully charged with a
vial of amber liquid attached ACKLAND SCREAMS and fall backwards onto
the floor his hands clawing at the air REVNA fumbles with the
injector control and gives him a blast in his upper arm ACKLAND
convulses once then goes still his eyes staring fixedly at the
ceiling The Infirmary is deathly quiet once again

We hear a gentle CRACKING like twigs being snapped REVNA watches in
horrified fascination as a pool of blood spreads swiftly outward across
the floor from below ACKLANDs corpse REVNA shudders as the body
moves a little then is rolled over by something underneath it

WHAT SHE SEES ACKLANDs body slumps forward onto its front
revealing a gaping cavity in his back Bits of spine and ribcage are
just visible A CHESTBURSTER - the second stage of the ALIEN lifeform
- pulls itself clear and wipes red gunk from its body with a pair of
still-underdeveloped arms

Around its head is a distinctive nascent crest It kicks away from
ACKLAND with a powerful push from its legs quickly gaining balance
After a moment appraising its new environment it stalks off behind a
table REVNA thinks quickly She leaps forward and THUMPS a large red
stud next to the pressure-door which promptly RUMBLES closed

The room is bathed in pools of shadows Plenty of hiding space for the
creature REVNA hears breaking glass making her start She
cautiously edges over to the Autodoc and looks up into the forest of
probe-arms

Theres a wicked looking blade there the kind used in major surgery
REVNA reaches up and twists the base it detaches easily Now shes
armed Stooped over she begins to stalk the CHESTBURSTER

Theres a flurry of movement and suddenly the hunter becomes the
hunted The CHESTBURSTER vaults from the table at her with a SHRILL
SHRIEK and REVNA blindly swings her make-shift knife in defense We
hear a SIZZLE like frying bacon

HIROKO sprints down the corridor and reaches the Infirmary DILLER
CASSIE and a few others are crowded around outside YORK lays
unconscious on one of the medical trolleys next to the door making
access difficult Above them a hinged flap on the wall lies open
revealing a circular mechanism beneath BREWSTER scratches at the
bulkhead and WHINES MUFFLED THUMPS come from within

HIROKO
What happened

DILLER
York just turned up outside Were trying to get him into Infirmary

HIROKO (astonished)
York

HIROKO leans over to examine him but a particularly loud CRASH from
within the Infirmary distracts her

HIROKO (CONTD)
Whats going on

CASSIE
The doors sealed from inside Doc Revnas in there and it sounds
like Acklands going nuts

HIROKO
Force the door

DILLER
Cant Its pressure sealed

GUTTIEREZ races up and hands DILLER a wrench with a shaped tip

GUTTIEREZ
Here

DILLER
Thanks

He inserts the end into the open flap and pulls hard the physical
effort showing on his face The door grinds open about eight inches

The bloodied CHESTBURSTER forces itself through the narrow gap HISSING
vehemently Yellow fluid wells from a wound in its crested skull
dissolving everything it comes into contact with The small group
gathered around fall back in panic jarring YORKs trolley and knocking
HIROKO to the floor BREWSTER BARKS at the CHESTBURSTER which tenses
as if to leap

DILLER brings the wrench down but the CHESTBURSTER evades his blow and
takes flight It strikes at HIROKO who reflexively draws her head
back and escapes with nothing more than a light scratch to the cheek
The ALIEN disappears down the corridor leaving a trail of smeared
blood and a series of acidic pits which melt the grillework flooring
GUTTIEREZ bends down and

helps HIROKO to her feet Shocked she MUTTERS something to herself in
JAPANESE and regains some of her composure

HIROKO
Get after it dont let it get away

DILLER stands there with the metal bar Does she think hes nuts

HIROKO (CONTD)
Go on

This galvanises DILLER He races off in pursuit

HIROKO (CONTD)
Jan give me a hand over here

HIROKO AND GUTTIEREZ try to force the door but DILLER was right - it
wont budge HIROKO slips her arm through the gap and fumbles around
blindly She must have hit the control knob because the door slides
back CASSIE looks inside

are blood-smears over everything and its all GUTTIEREZ can do to stop
BREWSTER from getting in there

INT RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

PARSONS finger traces a path along a set of computer schematics
displayed on a suspended glass screen

PARSONS
It left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here

HIROKO
What is that

DILLER
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system I found the grating
ripped right off The little fucker was strong

HIROKO
Where does that lead to

PARSONS

Central Pumping All the waste gets treated broken-down and flushed
out into the swamp If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked-
out

HIROKO
Youve checked that end
GUTTIEREZ
Not yet no

HIROKO
Do it I dont want that thing on my installation I want it caught
and destroyed

KAMEN

Cornering it shouldnt be a problem Each part of this station is
basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off
external couplers If we disconnect them and seal off every section
weve got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power That
should give us ample time to find it

HIROKO

Alright Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores and Ill sign
a release for the weapons Cassie organise a team roster and put it
on the board

CASSIE nods soberly HIROKO looks at everybody and her words are
carefully chosen

HIROKO (CONTD)
I dont care how you kill this thing just be careful not to get in
its way when it bleeds You all saw what happened to Doc Revna

There are nods of agreement and general enthusiasm all round

HIROKO (CONTD)

Nobody wander off on their own until its found Keep in pairs
Diller once the first teams done their sweep I want you to go down
with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it

DILLER

Okay

HIROKO

One final point Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in
itself However just to add a little incentive Im authorizing a

hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does

This seems to appeal to those assembled there Theres a palpable buzz
in the air

They mustve wasted Beauvais and Minh inside thirty seconds Minh got
off a couple of shots from that cannon of his but he might as well
have been using a B-B gun I dont know how the hell I made it out of
there alive

Listen to what

Thats what I mean This is the quietest Ive ever heard it Its
unnatural

GUTTIEREZ shivers in the wind as he looks out into the impenetrable
blackness beyond the confines of the base

Yeah

GUTTIEREZ
Next time you have a thought like that Keep it to yourself

scraping of METAL-ON-METAL

DILLER
What is thatis that it

URIOSTE
No I think thats a regulator valve Hold on

Theres more NOISE
URIOSTE (CONTD)
Ah got it

About a dozen fluorescent strips ringing the small circular chamber
illuminate Three others flicker erratically one of them remaining
unlit DILLER waves the tracker cautiously around and keeps his pulse-
rifle level He enters followed by URIOSTE Shes carrying a portable
- but bulky - piece of machinery

URIOSTE
Are you getting anything

DILLER (sarcastic)
Yeah eyestrain Whats with the lights

URIOSTE
Theyre always like that Head-Office are real cheap when it comes to
spares Wave that thing in the corner

DILLER sweeps the tracker carefully around The small screen registers
nothing

DILLER
The rooms clean

URIOSTE
Great

URIOSTE pulls at a two-piece hexagonal grating set in the center of the
floor Its heavy and thick with grease but she doesnt seem to mind
Below it is what looks like a round metal plug Recessed into its
surface is a lever next to a central pressure valve with handholds on
either side She turns the lever Theres a loud CLUNK and a plume
of steam JETS out of the valve

URIOSTE (CONTD)
Give me a hand with this

GRUNTING the two of them pull the thick metal plug clear of the pit
Murky water sloshes around below URIOSTE pulls a second lever and
hidden pumps make the water level drop rapidly

URIOSTE (CONTD)
Pass me over that tripod will you

Leaning against the wall behind DILLER is a sturdy metal tripod topped
with a block-and-tackle arrangement A hook dangles below this its
thick metal cabling going up through the block-and-tackle and
connecting to the drum of a small industrial winch attached securely to
the wall DILLER hands the tripod over to URIOSTE She splays the
legs apart and inserts their tips into matching holes around the open
pit

DE VRIES fingers a rough metal edge

DE VRIES
Hey Guttierez

GUTTIEREZ
What

DE VRIES
Take a look at this

GUTTIEREZ moves over for a closer look Theres a torn hole in the
meshwork just big enough for a rhino to squeeze through Blood and
fragments of skin coat the edge of the gap

GUTTIEREZ
One of ‘em must have escaped

DE VRIES

Thats impossible man This fence is high-tensile The breaking
toleranced stand up to the strain of a rhino easy I know I put it
up

GUTTIEREZ shines the flashlight along the deck A trail of smeared
blood runs all the way to the perimeter The surrounding fence has
been buckled and twisted They cross to it and look down at the swamp
The torch beam sparkles on the murky water far below

GUTTIEREZ
Theres no way a rhinod survive that drop

The second blip on the small screen abruptly vanishes

From behind the metal disc there comes a SHUFFLING SOUND followed by a

a spray of bullets

HIROKO looks up startled by the sound of GUNFIRE She sees the
rooftop of one of the building modules lit by tracer fire BREWSTERs
tethered nearby BARKING furiously

INT RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM - PUMP SHAFT

A think metal cable connected to her jacket harness suspends URIOSTE in
the gloom of the Pump Shaft In front of her is a machine-part we saw
her carry earlier With the strap of a flashlight clenched in her
mouth shes just finishing up bolting the part to the larger piece of
machinery in an alcove with simultaneously doing her best not to touch
the walls which are covered by a thin layer of gunge

The REPORT of DE VRIES weapon can be heard even down here perhaps
more startling in the confined space URIOSTE jumps dropping the
flashlight into the water in the process

INT RYUSHI STATION - PUMP ROOM

DILLER turns away from the winch and peers into and beyond the access
tunnel leading outside URIOSTEs VOICE floats up out of the shaft

luminous digital counter giving the current cable depth in meters He
pulls a throw-switch and the display slowly changes from 8 to 95
as the cable feeds out

Its just about in reach

Six slender fingers EXPLODE from beneath the waters surface and clamp
like a vise around URIOSTEs wrist A sleek eyeless head follows
trailing a body straight out of a charnel-house nightmare A SCREAM
forms in her throat rapidly cut-off as the ALIENs other hand clamps
firmly over her mouth jerking her downwards

DILLER whirls in response to the CHOKED CRY from below He sees the
winch tripod above the shaft RATTLE the cable going taut as an
anglers line The wall-mounted drum is yanked so hard the lever leaps
from its clamped position freely unspooling cable at a frightening
rate The digital counter flickers rapidly

legs buckle and collapse under the tremendous strain He scrambles for
the winch-lever and only just manages to lock it firmly into place the
over-stressed cable vibrating with a LOW METALLIC TWANG as it hits the
shafts edge DILLERs moment of satisfaction is short-lived the
deep-sunk bolts attaching the mechanism to the wall are pull outward by
the colossal force from below He leaps aside avoiding the heavy
piece of machinery as it HURTLES towards him Watches it disappear
noisily into the conduit

He feverishly reaches the shafts edge and peers into the darkness

WHAT HE SEES The torchbeam picks out the biomechanical form of the
ALIEN emerging from the sewage and effortlessly climbing the shaft
walls towards him Recoiling in horror he makes a run for the door
Half-way there he remembers his pulse-rifle and dives to the floor
grasping it just as the ALIEN reaches the top DILLER fumbles with the
safety and give the creature a full BLAST on rock-and-roll BLASTING it
back into the pit

rifle Its the tiniest CLICK but the ALIEN somehow senses danger

CALDWELL gets in for his shot but the tails there in a second It
strikes like a snake Once Twice The stinger punctures CALDWELLs
chest and throat Nobody could survive something like that

inches away from its eyeless facea row of burnished metal teeth

openthe toothed inner tongue ready to strike

ALIEN drops KAMEN and WHIRLS A spear wielded by an INVISIBLE FORM
appears out of nowhere and PIERCES the ALIENs midriff spraying acidic
fluid The creature emits a OUTRAGED SHRIEK and flails around its
ubiquitous tail arcing toward the camouflaged assailant The STINGER
makes contact theres a SPUTTERING SOUND as the PREDATORs cloaking
device begins to flicker spasmodically giving us peek-a-boo glimpses
of its natural form Electrical sparks dance around the PREDATORs
ruin wrist-computer luminous green blood welling from a wound in his
arm

pressure bulkhead RUMBLE together A SECOND ALIEN appears from the
shadows within and prises its fingers into the dwindling gap
struggling for purchase Despite the ALIENs best efforts the door
motors are too powerful and the opening seals with a satisfying solid
CLUNK MUFFLED POUNDING comes from the other side

and is bringing it to bear on the PREDATOR At the last possible
moment HIROKO sees what hes about to do

wrenches it off HIROKO stares at the PREDATORs face in fascination
From the distinctive features we see that its BROKEN TUSK The
PREDATORs good hand flashes down to his thigh almost too quick to
follow In one rapid movement a circular smart-weapon is brought up
slicing the front of the ALIEN skull away from its head In a feat of
strength the PREDATOR lifts his opponents corpse on the end of the
spear and hurls it over the catwalk railing

Not wasting a second BROKEN TUSK performs an almost-vertical bound of
some twenty feet with astounding grace He grips a pipe running down
the side of one of the building modules then clambers over the roofs
edge and finally disappears from view BREWSTER continues to BARK

HIROKO enters her office at a run She crosses to an inset control box
on the far wall and presses a button Two exterior panels begin to
slide closed behind the polycarbonate window

KERSMASH Fracture lines appear on the toughened plastic as it comes
under assault from the razor-edge tip of an ALIENs tail In shock
HIROKO reflexively falls backwards onto the floor scrambling away
She watches the creature precariously balancing on the this ledge
outside fighting against the closing shutters with simultaneously
raining repeated blows on the window with its tail

The ALIEN leaps through the gap as the window gives way under the
onslaught showering splinters across the room The twin shutters
secure behind it closing on the creatures tail in the process It
HISSES in indignation and thrashes about Like a lizard the segmented
tail SNAPS in two The freed ALIEN staggers a little before gaining
balance blood dripping from the laceration and penetrating the wooden
floorboards It sights HIROKO and hurls itself in her direction an
unstoppable killing machine

HIROKO
Holo on

Her VOICE quavers so badly with fear and panic its a wonder the
computer can recognize it FOUR NINJA SWORDSMEN promptly appear
forming a semi-circle between HIROKO and the ALIEN The ALIEN halts
confused by this intrusion It swipes at the pre-programmed holograms
bewildered by the lack of contact as its claws pass through them

Gaining on a few seconds of bought time HIROKO flings herself towards
the PREDATOR spear lying forgotten nearby The ALIEN locks in on this
sudden movement and charges through the holograms at her HIROKO
GRUNTS swinging the spear with her full strength

Shes no super-athlete but the cutting edges advanced metallurgy does
the job It slices half-way through the ALIENs skull and sticks
there spewing yellow fluid everywhere HIROKO beats a hasty retreat
as the dying biomechanoid falls to the floor fumbling at the lodged
weapon

INT RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDORS
HIROKO reels into the outside corridor She SHRIEKS as her shoulders
are seized from behind

KAMEN
Come on

HIROKO looks at KAMEN confusedly as he continues along the corridor

HIROKO
Thats the wrong way

KAMEN
Detour Other ways blocked

EXT RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM FAR SIDE - DUSK

Back outside the ALIENS have sensed that somethings amiss DE VRIES
turns desperately to GUTTIEREZ

DE VRIES
You got any slugs left

GUTTIEREZ looks down at the counter on his slung weapon

GUTTIEREZ
Yeah Uh

DE VRIES rips the weapon off his shoulder GUTTIEREZ completes his
sentence

GUTTIEREZ (CONTD)
Seven

BLAM BLAM BLAM DE VRIES tries to make each shot count She
sights an ALIEN crawling across the top of a group of cylindrical
storage containers Draws a bead on the metal tank and fires

A molten ball EXPLODES outward transforming the immediate vicinity
into a blazing inferno The ALIENs body twists end-over-end
remaining immobile as it hits the deck A curtain of fire ripples
across the platform

THOMAS
Yes

Their victory is short-lived The other ALIENS crawl cautiously
forward flames licking their faces but leaving them unharmed We can
clearly hear the HISSING of their internal jaws

DE VRIES
Try again man

The headset in GUTTIEREZ hand BLEEPS as it turns into the correct
channel He YELLS into it

GUTTIEREZ
Matt Open these damn doors right now Ill ream your ass so bad these
things out herell seem like the Easter Bunny in comparison Swear to
God

THOMAS turns and hammers on the impenetrable plate metal

THOMAS
Open the doors Open the goddamned fucking doors

BLAM BLAM BLAM CLICK GUTTIEREZ bullets are gone

DE VRIES
Thats it Were dead

The first of the ALIENS rushes at them This is the end DE VRIES
SCREAMS

Theres a blinding flash and most of the ALIENs head vaporises
GUTTIEREZ blinks is disbelief as hazy SHAPES comprised of refracted
fire suddenly occupy the killing ground between the HUMAN and ALIEN
antagonists Intense bursts of light illuminate the platform as hi-
tech PREDATOR weaponry far in advance of the humans sears the air

GUTTIEREZ turns at the SOUND of the huge metal doors GRINDING slowly
open Just enough for them to get through

GUTTIEREZ
Move

INT RYUSHI STATION - AUTO-SHOP

THOMAS pushes DE VRIES through the opening with GUTTIEREZ hurriedly
following

The Auto-shop is a large spacious workshop with three bays lining one
wall The front of a crawler pokes from one of them while in the
center of the room another crawler is raised above a maintenance-pit on
a hydraulic platform A handful of GREASE MONKEYS stands around the
doorway brandishing power-tools in lieu of firearms A blonde surfer-
type with long straggly

hair rushes over to them This is MATT their savior

MATT
Close it up close it up

GUTTIEREZ stares through the narrow opening as the doors seal back up
In the midst of the flames the ALIENS are fighting a pitched battle
tooth-and-nail with their unseen opponents Its like a scene out of
Hell

INT RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDORS
Clusters of rotating emergency lights wig-wag above HIROKO and KAMEN as
they flee through the maze of long corridors leading to the Command

Center KAMEN is falling behind as they approach a junction

HIROKO
Hurry it up
KAMEN
Dont wait for me

HIROKO and KAMEN race along the final corridor leading to the Command
Center Halfway down KAMEN turns in response to a JARRING SOUND from
the rear The metal grating making up the floor is SMASHED violently
from beneath

KAMEN
Run

INT RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

The PANDEMONIUM from the outside corridors gets the attention of YORK
and everybody else in admin He crosses to the bulkhead doorframe and
what he sees makes his eyes bug

YORK
Jesus Christ

He SHOUTS back into the crowded room

YORK (CONTD)
Theyre inside inside the corridor

INT RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDOR

HIROKO and KAMEN try to outrun the tidal wave of twisted and broken
steel that emerges in their wake KAMEN YELLS with fright as an ALIEN
claw pinions his ankle He trashes about clutching at anything to
prevent himself being dragged beneath the floor CRYING OUT is pain as
slivers of edged metal slice into his hands

HIROKO (anguished)
No

INT RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

YORK stands frozen at the bulkhead frame staring down the corridor in
horror CASSIE races up and pushes him out of the way

INT RYUSHI STATION - CORRIDOR

HIROKO looks furiously around Spying an emergency axe in its wall
housing she SMASHES the glass with her elbow cutting herself in the
process HIROKO hefts the heavy tool swinging it down onto the
disappearing ALIENs carapace with all her might

HIROKO (CONTD)
Bastard

The blade bites deep and yellow blood bursts from the threshing
ALIENs wound Speckles of it dot KAMENs leg eating through the
material of his trousers and into the skin and muscle beneath He
SCREAMS a sound of pure intense pain
HIROKO hurls the axe aside She begins pulling KAMEN out of the hole
as the caustic liquid seeps into the nearby electrical conduit

Theres a SPARKING followed by a FLASH and a SHEET OF FLAME CASSIE
steps through into the corridor just as valves evenly-spaced along the
length of the tunnel open up jetting white high-density foam under
extreme pressure The hatch to the Command Center at the far end
begins to close

HIROKO
Cassie

CASSIEs head shoots around
INT RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

YORK seizes a metal chair from behind a nearby console and wedges it
into the narrowing divide CASSIE squeezes through the gap and
urgently HOLLERS to HIROKO

CASSIE
It you dont uh move your ass youre gonna need a helluva diet
to get through here

INT RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

from CASSIEs POV we watch HIROKO supporting KAMEN and stumbling him
along Foam fills three-quarters of the corridor to their rear and is
nearly up to their knees everywhere else The chairs frame CREAKS
ominously in protest

YORK
Hurry up were losing it

CASSIEs eyes widen in terror

CASSIE
Behind you

HIROKO turns to see the long phallic head of an ALIEN emerge
momentarily from out of the foam Something yanks at KAMEN and he

disappears beneath the surface with an expression of pained surprise

HIROKO
Kamen

HIROKO starts to thrash at the foam but CASSIE reaches out and drags
her away

CASSIE
Its too late

HIROKO
Nooooo

The chair begins to buckle collapsing in on itself

YORK
Its going

With a supreme effort CASSIE yanks HIROKO through the gap YORK
vaults clear as the chair SNAPS in two leaving the bulkhead to THUNDER
closed The two women collapse in a heap on the floor

EXT RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - DUSK

The battle outside is going badly for the PREDATORS Theres only
three of them left and one is BROKEN TUSK

A projectile WHISTLES through the air towards an ALIEN expanding in
flight into a wire capture net Barbed tips on each corner bite into
the wall of a base module trapping the enraged creature Small motors
WHINE as the thin metal pulls inward slicing into the ALIENs body

The PREDATOR savors the scene for just a secondwhich is a second too
long ALIENS are all over him clawing and ripping at his body The
shoulder-mounted plasma-cannon is unceremoniously yanked away and
CLATTERS to the floor

The PREDATOR goes down groping for the self-destruct system on his
wrist He manages to stroke a fingernail across the activation bar but
gets no further An ALIEN pounces at him its tail descending The
PREDATOR raises his arm in reflex but the stinger SMASHES straight
through the buries it in his face-plate taking out the wrist-computer
in the process

INT RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

HIROKO stares at the closed bulkhead with an expression of dazed
disbelief

PARSONS

No reaction He tries again

PARSONS (CONTD)

HIROKO snaps out of it She crosses over to the bank of monitoring
screens

HIROKO
Whats the story

PARSONS runs through each of the screens

PARSONS

Everything on this module is locked and sealed Weve lost B C
and E wings but E was the only one we didnt manage to totally
evacuate

HIROKO
How many how many people are missing
CASSIE
Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far but the numbers are all over
the place

HIROKO
Whats our weapons situation

DRISCOLL - a big guy with a beard - LAUGHS curtly

DRISCOLL

EXT RYUSHI STATION - ROOFTOPS - DUSK

BROKEN TUSK and the other PREDATOR scramble up onto the rooftop ina
bid to escape their unstoppable opponents Back-to-back they take up
fighting positions A few seconds later the first of the ALIENS
arrives

Both the PREDATORS shoulder cannons blaze firing volley-after-volley
Still the ALIENS keep on coming finally reaching the point where its
hand-to-handand nothing else

Its a vicious fast and bloody on both sides BROKEN TUSK takes
flight his companion is not as lucky The other PREDATOR kicks an
ALIEN from him and over the roofs edge The ALIEN lashes out with
lightning-fast reflexes pulling the PREDATOR with it Both creatures
hurtle downward and hit a nest of cabling stretched across from one of
the modules Caught like flies in a spiders web Both thrash about
severing cables as they do Electrical sparks CRACKLE through the
air

INT RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

Everything electrical in the Command Center flickers momentarily and
the bank of monitors turn to static Theres an instant of silence
collective concerns amongst those gathered there

Dont panic people Weve just switched over to internals

HIROKO
They knocked out the external feeds

PARSONS
Looks like it

Maybe they aint coming Maybe they dont even know weve got
problems

I dont wanna hear that kind of crap Thomas Theyre coming Just a
matter of time thats all

De Vries put a round through the storage tanks over by the west pier on
the way in here Right now the stuff sprayin out is just burnin up
but if we get a blow-back a good part of the station could go with it

Alright lets keep calm Weve got to have an option of some sort
theres got to be a way out of this

Oh yeah Like what

YORKs kept quiet but everyone turns to him now His tone is scathing
and cuts to the marrow

Well it occurred to me that we could use the overhead crane to load
the admin module onto the back of Big Bertha That way we could put a
bit of distance

INT RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER

MATT (CONTD) (OS on speakers
Between us and the station Least till the guys from Fort Powell
arrive

Nah Its got programmable facilities but it was never rigged for
remote operation Someoned have to go up to the cab to get it up and
running

HIROKO
Which mean physically going outside

DRISCOLL looks around uneasily

DRISCOLL
Yeah

INT RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER - LOWER DECK

A small group of people most of whom we saw in the Command Center are
clustered around a section of the poorly-lit maintenance corridor
HIROKOs wearing a black hi-tech catsuit a fetishists dream Across
her shoulder is a pistol in a slung bandolier holster She nods at a
pile of clothing in DRISCOLLs hands

HIROKO
Is this the suit

DRISCOLL
Uh-huh

She takes it from him Slides her legs into the bottom half and pulls
it up YORK watches with an expression of incredulity etched on his
face

YORK
This is fuckin lunacy Youre not gonna make it across the platform
on foot

CASSIE
Shut up York

HIROKO
No hes right Has anyone got a bike near here

A REDHEADED GIRL looks around hesitantly then raises her voice

REDHEADED GIRL
I have

HIROKO
Let me have the keys

The GIRL rummages in her pockets and throws the keys over HIROKO puts
them in a pocket on the suits sleeve

HIROKO (CONTD)
Which one is it

REDHEADED GIRL
Uh the Hyundai racer Yellow and black stripes

YORK
Oh yeah Real inconspicuous

HIROKO
Listen I dont care if its pink and purple polka-dots as long as it
gets me there in one piece Somebody loan me a headset

CASSIE pulls off hers and hands it over DRISCOLLs watching HIROKO
fasten up the suit He spots a mistake

DRISCOLL
No go back Second clasp from the bottom

HIROKO finds the offending clasp and locks it

HIROKO
How much air-time have I got

CASSIE
About thirty minutes Those are slimmed-down tanks so no stopping to
admire the scenery

HIROKO
Deal
CASSIE

Weve dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into
the helmet Itll project the route through the sewer system onto the
inside of the glass as you go

DRISCOLL
Yeah I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the
helmet pick-ups too Thats also on the display

HIROKO
Sounds great

PARSONS
Its not all good news We had to take off the helmet lights Youll
be going in blind

HIROKO
What Why

DRISCOLL

We had to They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits
youre gonna have to negotiate Besides all the crap floating around
reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights
would have make that much difference anyway Maintenance lights down
there oughta be enough to do the trick

HIROKO
How tight are these shafts

CASSIE and DRISCOLL exchange worried looks

CASSIE
Tight We chose a route we felt would reduce the chance of you running
into any Aliens

HIROKO takes a deep breath Beads of perspiration dot her forehead
PARSONS nods

PARSONS
Theres still time to back-out

HIROKO
Forget it I wouldnt ask somebody to do something I wouldnt do
myself Wheres the disk

PARSONS hands over a vinyl-wrapped packet

PARSONS
Dont lose it

HIROKO slips it into a breast-pocket and secures the flap

Dont worry I wont

DRISCOLL hands several metallic objects to HIROKO
DRISCOLL
Here If you got to use em make em count

Theyre magazines for her gun She slots them into the bandolier

HIROKO
Thanks

Lets just run through it one more time so I know youve got it
straight

HIROKO
Okay I pull the access panel off of the console Insert the disk and
press the green enabling button

PARSONS (interrupting)
No Theres two of them

She pulls on the zip and begins locking the harness clasps into place

HIROKO
Sorry Two green enabling buttons

PARSONS

Right When youve done that dont waste any time getting out of
there Once that crane starts movingwell its bound to provoke
some kind of response

Youll need this for the gratings Trigger finger to operate thumb
button to switch over to the rivet gun The sensorsll choose blade or
socket heads automatically

YORK and DRISCOLL lower the massive dome-fronted helmet over HIROKOs
head Auto-clasps lock into place as it brackets with the collar
PARSONS clips the slimline air-tank to her back and DRISCOLL makes the
connections

Alright lets open her up Carefully now

CASSIE and the others hold their weapons and motion-trackers steadily
at a fixed point on the ground Two ONLOOKERS bend down to the

Worried hands grab her

calms down

shapes comprised of surreal creatures and protrusions are starting to
cover its surface ALIENS drop from dizzying heights exuding streams
of gelatinous gunk from the four exhaust pipes on their backs
Theyre building a nest of staggering proportions

Theyre comin up through the pit

CRUSHING their chitinous limbs to smithereens

GREASE MONKEY being tugged into the maintenance opening THOMAS yells

A box with two large buttons - one green one red - dangles from the
ceiling on the end of a cable MATT forces down the red control
making the platform lower Several tons of machinery and crawler bring
about the demise of the ALIENS as they reach the lip of the opening

An ALIEN rolls out of the pit in time scrambling for the safety of the

nearby shadows DE VRIES sights it

block suspended from a winch high above He LEAPS for the release-

catch as the ALIEN passes underneath Pulls hard on the grip

RATTLE noisily as the block THUNDERS down The ALIEN begins to look
up just a second too late The heavy piece of machinery SMASHES into

the creature flattening it instantly
Unseen by anybody another ALIEN has escaped to the roof of the
platform-bound crawler It wraps its long bony fingers around the
face of the MAN stifling his CRIES and pulling him off the deck The
LOUD CLATTERING of his chainsaw bouncing off the floor-grating gets

Mother-fucker

THOMAS retrieves the fallen tool and jams the on switch hard The
ALIENs tongue shoots through the GREASE MONKEYs skull showering
THOMAS with a faint speckling of blood The ALIEN discards the body
and lunges at THOMAS who counters bringing the chainsaw up

The blade slices into the creatures throat and up through its head

way What fills the remainder freezes her with revulsion

slime from her helmet yet again

And finds herself staring at an ALIEN EGG its top cracking open in
four neat sections The FACEHUGGER leaps straight as her faceplate

And misses its fingers failing to gain purchase on the slippery
dome HIROKO kicks away from the spindly creature as it orientates
itself on the waters surface its powerful tail propelling itself
back toward her It contracts on itself preparing to leap HIROKO
raises the power-tool

reflexively squeezing the trigger again and again Fat rivets RIP

Traversing venturi duct en route to platform surface

claw snakes in groping blindly just inches from her feet She grits
her teeth and puts more effort into her ascent

frantically to gain purchase on anything She fails The ALIEN draws
her nearer its other hand closing on the helmets visor Fracture
lines appear on the glass followed by cracks Polluted water starts
to flood in while air-bubbles expand outward from the broken glass
HIROKO drives the power-tool at the ALIEN and mashes the trigger
Rivets penetrate the creatures endoskeleton making it draw back A
haze of yellow blood spills out into the duct HIROKO pushes upward
coughing She closes her fist around a lever above Pulls on it with
all her might

EXT RYUSHI STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

Internal pressure forces the metallic plug out like a champagne cork
It hits the platform with a loud CLUNK HIROKO hauls herself from the
shaft trailing a cloud of smoke as the acid eats into her suit She
throws the helmet to the ground SHATTERING the visor Yanks
desperately at the suits release clamps kicking the ruined garment
off

As promised the yellow-and-black hoverbike is nearby HIROKO starts
towards it then remembers the keys are in the sleeve pocket of the
ruined pressure-suit She drops to he knees and gingerly pokes through
the smoking pile of cloth Finds the flap RIPS it open and withdraws
the keys

SLAP A glistening wet claw emerges from the open hole HIROKO
scrambles to her feet as the injured ALIEN pulls itself out She tears
across to the bike and rams the key into the ignition The turbines
ROAR to life and it lifts smoothly into the air HIROKO pivots the
powerful machine around avoiding the creatures questing grasp

Losing its balance the ALIEN SMASHES into the deck

HIROKOs guns the bike away speeding along the platform The fire
over by the auto-shop rages out of control a column of black-and-
orange smoke rising into the air

A DARK FORM hurls itself at her from an overhead cable-support Yet
another ALIEN It lands awkwardly on the protruding front cowl of the
hoverbike gaining balance in an instant

HIROKO twists on her controls trying to dislodge the creature by see-
sawing the bike side-to-side The ALIENs got a firm hold though
crawling hand-over-hand towards her HIROKO releases her grip on both
throttles simultaneously Air-brakes cut in and the bike SLAMS to a
halt The breath WHOOSHES out of HIROKO as her chest impacts with the
surrounding roll-bar The ALIEN is even less fortunate momentum hurls
it back onto the concrete HIROKO guns the engine again and the
leading-edge of the manta-shaped machines aerofoil catches the rising
creature neatly decapitating it

the QUEEN who almost loses her grip on the skeletal metalwork She
HISSES lashing out at the creature Sends it hurtling to the ground

EXT RYUSHI STATION - TOWER CATWALK - PRE-DAWN

BROKEN TUSK makes it to the top Theres not much space on the catwalk
to maneuver He looks around then down This is his last stand
Instinctively he reaches down to his wrist for the self-destruct
computer Of course its not there

tower the door on the co-pilots side flapping open She HOLLERS at
the PREDATOR over the ROAR of the engines

Cmon Jump

BROKEN TUSK looks down Its a long dropbut its the best option
available to him He jumps

THWACK His hands grip the door frame The heli-jet wobbles slightly
its center of gravity shifting BROKEN TUSK hauls himself up and
through the door as

KER-BLAM A massive explosion mushrooms up from the base as the
storage tanks below ignite The shock wave buffets the chopper against

the tower

BROKEN TUSKs POV
The grinning face of the young QUEEN gets suddenly closer as the heli-
jet is propelled towards the metal structure

EXT RYUSHI STATION - NAVIGATION TOWER - PRE-DAWN

CRUNCH The chopper hits knocking several ALIENS from their
handholds One of the QUEENs arms SHOOTS OUT wrapping itself around
the port engine mount

INT CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

HIROKO pushes on the stick The heli-jet pulls awaythen tilts
violently to one side engines desperately trying to compensate

EXT RYUSHI STATION - PRE-DAWN

The QUEEN is hanging from the beleaguered craft its weight drawing it
slowly down In the BACKGROUND the Navigation Tower begins to slowly
collapse

HIROKO wrestles the overtaxed controls

HIROKO
Shit

BROKEN TUSK turns towards her

HIROKO (CONTD)
In the back In the back

The PREDATOR may not understand her words but he can follow the
frantic jerking of her hand He twists around to look in the choppers
rear

EXT RYUSHI STATION - PRE-DAWN

HIROKO pilots the heli-jet over the stations storage tanks The
conflagration below has gotten completely out-of-hand

EXT CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
The QUEEN is starting to struggle up its arms flailing for purchase
INT CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

BROKEN TUSK pulls out a pulse-rifle from the rear He quickly takes
stock of it

HIROKO
Watch your shots If you hit the engine youll blow us both to hell

BROKEN TUSK goes for the trigger His index finger wont slide into
the trigger guardits too big He takes the guard in both hands and
exerts pressure SNAP Problem solved

A red dot of light runs across the QUEENs head She must sense it
somehow Her head comes round to bear

BROKEN TUSKs got the pulse-rifle trained right on her

BROKEN TUSK
Chewonthis

BLAM A round open a nice neat hole in the QUEENs head She YOWLS
BLAM A second round does the job The QUEEN relinquishes her grip and
falls SCREECHING all the way down into the raging inferno below

HIGH-PITCHED TONE

INT CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

HIROKO throws the joystick forward

EXT RYUSHI STATION - PRE-DAWN

The heli-jet accelerates hell-for-leather away An incandescent BALL
OF ENERGY expands outward vaporising the station and most of the
surrounding bayou for about a miles radius

EXT LINSONS RANGE - ENCAMPMENT - PRE-DAWN

Big Berthas parked by the blinking blue beacon tower site of the ill-
fated hunting expedition About a dozen or so people are milling

around smoking cigarettes or talking

MATT and DE VRIES are leaning against the wheels of MATTs crawler
They feel the concussive shock-wave and look upward

Their POV
Above the treetops a blinding white-light BLURS OUT the horizon

MATT
Holy shit

INT CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

Gauges and other instruments are going crazy as the heli-jet rides the
turbulence out
EXT CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

A chunk of metal is propelled through the air and RIPS into the
choppers starboard engine Theres a BURST of flame then the
extinguishers cut in

INT CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

The heli-jets bucking like a bronco now and theyre losing height
rapidly

HIROKO
Weve lost the starboard engine Were going down Hold on

EXT CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN
The chopper clips the tree boughs and bounces
INT CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

HIROKO and BROKEN TUSK are hurled around the cockpit like rag dolls
The glass cracks with the impact

HIROKOS POV
Leaves twigs and branches rush past as the heli-jet breaks through
the canopy of foliage

EXT SWAMP - PRE-DAWN

The heli-jet PLOUGHS into the swamp floor with a sickening CRUNCH
spraying mud all around

INT CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

The canopy implodes A hail of glass shards RIP through the cockpit
spraying across HIROKO and cutting her skin She SCREAMS

EXT SWAMP - PRE-DAWN

The chopper comes to rest in the swamp The SQUAWKING of the local
WILDLIFE OS gradually dies down

INT CHOPPER - PRE-DAWN

HIROKO moves her head and GROANS Theres a nasty gash across her
forehead She turns to BROKEN TUSK The door frame on his side is
buckled and twisted Part of the metal has sheared off its sharp end
impaling him through the shoulder The PREDATOR coughs luminous green
blood

HIROKO
Weve gotta get you out of here

EXT SWAMP - DAWN

The sun begins to rise as HIROKO exits the heli-jet and goes around to
the other side She manages to get the mangled door open BROKEN
TUSKs wound looks even worse up-close

HIROKO (CONTD)
Hold on This is gonna hurt some

HIROKO gets her arm under BROKEN TUSKs shoulder The PREDATOR braces
himself and starts to move The agony is excruciating his mandibles
open and he lets out a LEONINE ROAR

HIROKO helps him out of the seat The PREDATOR gets unsteadily to his
feet What happens next is totally unexpected

BROKEN TUSKs throat BURSTS fountaining green blood Shocked HIROKO
gets out of the path of the PREDATORs tumbling mass She looks up

The ALIEN stowaway on the roof of the chopper retracts its
sledgehammer tongue its head following her movements

The PREDATORs smart weapon has dropped to the floor and is laying
blade-down in the mire HIROKO scoops up activating it and scrambling
away She gets to her feet and holds the HUMMING disc before her

The ALIEN climbs warily down from the heli-jet and the two opponents
face each other like sumo wrestlers HIROKO assumes a defensive
stance holding the disc ready to strike The ALIEN hisses its tail
stinger coming around It leaps for her and battle is joined The
ALIEN lashes out but HIROKO counters by swinging the weapon time and
time again With each thrust surgically thin wounds open up on the
biomechanoids body One of the ALIENs attacks sends her reeling to
the floor its stinger arching towards her She parries slicing the
tail in half and struggling to her feet

The ALIEN strikes again HIROKO feints then thrusts lopping off one
of its hands The ALIEN HOWLS with pain blinding lashing out at her
and sending the smart weapon flying from her grip

Shes lost and the creature knows it Its lips curl into a SNARL
KER-POW KER-POW The ALIENs head DETONATES and its skeletal body
slumps forward to SPLASH into the swamprevealing BROKEN TUSK
pointing the pulse

rifle

The dying PREDATOR GURGLES his head drooping HIROKO stumbles across
to him BROKEN TUSKs in a bad way green gore is pulsing freely from
its throat It gazes up at HIROKO

BROKEN TUSK
Nota prettysight

And with that the PREDATOR dies

HIROKO look around The sun is rising above the treetops and the
setting is serene Somehow beautiful

The speakers in the heli-jet cabin CRACKLE to life jarring her

HIROKOs POV
A pair of MARINE DROPSHIPS float above the distant rainforest their

weapons arms unfurled like exotic armed insects Searchlights probe the
ground far below

A shadow falls over HIROKO blocking out the sun A monstrous SHAPE
occupies the air above delineated only by a telltale vibration The
PREDATOR shuttlecraft lowers its cloaking device extending landing
gear and a ramp It touches down in the bayou with scarcely a whisper

HIROKO watches the PREDATORS file slowly out BROKEN TUSKs body is
borne aloft and carried back inside The LEAD PREDATOR turns to
HIROKO He crosses to her HIROKOs face is reflected in the faceted
eyepieces of the PREDATORs helmet

The extraterrestrial hunter pulls out his telescopic spear KER-CHUNK
The tips lock into place The PREDATOR offers it to HIROKO She
accepts a little confused

Theres a long moment The PREDATOR is still standing there Waiting
HIROKOs eyes narrow Her mind is working furiously What do they
want

She realises It suddenly becomes clear She smiles

HIROKO
Yeah Why not

HIROKO glances back at the hovering DROPSHIPS then walks around the
waiting PREDATOR and into the shuttlecraft without looking back

The PREDATOR follows her The ramp SLAMS closed as we
