MANS FOOTPRINT
on the moon

EXT MOON

Camera begins to pull back slowly straight up - the song
Moon Shadow by Cat Stevens begins Once we are high enough
to see the entire moon the main title is superimposed

AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON

We continue to retreat from the moon looking on as it grows
farther from us continuing credits until the full moon is
the size it appears to us from earth

EXT CROSSROADS ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

Tree branches enter into the frame the camera pans down and
we see a truck approaching We are at a crossroads in the
moors looking sinister enough to have earned their literary
reputation

The truck stops at the crossroads the DRIVER mustached and
wearing tweeds boots and a muffler climbs down

Moon Shadow ends

CUT TO

Loud bang of the back grating on the truck as it slams down
Revealed among the sheep are two rudely-awakened young

American boys They look exhausted They both carry backpacks
two American kids on a jaunt in Europe They are both in
their late twenties

It is very cold and they clamber out of the truck none too
happily Pushing sheep aside they step out and stretch

JACK GOODMAN AND DAVID KESSLER
Theyve been cramped for hours

TRUCK DRIVER
Here lads East Proctor and all
about are the moors go east here

JACK
Yes well thank you very much for
the ride sir You have lovely sheep

TRUCK DRIVER

(as he clambers back

up on his truck)

Boys keep off the moors Stay on
the road Good luck to you

DAVID
Thanks again

He drives off LONG SHOT of the two boys as the lorry pulls
away Surrounding them are the moors They put on their packs
David points to the signpost pointing towards East Proctor

EXT ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

As they walk their breath visible

JACK
Are you cold

DAVID
Yes

JACK
Good

They walk on finally
DAVID
Jack

JACK
David

DAVID

JACK

The camera shows us the moors - desolate cold foreboding

DAVID
Well like it here

JACK

DAVID

They walk on

JACK
Do you think shell meet me in Rome

DAVID

person with a good body

JACK

one of the great bodies of all time

DAVID
Shes a jerk

JACK
Youre talking about the woman

DAVID

fuck so give me a break

JACK
Well anyway do you think shell be
there

DAVID

JACK

(like an announcer)

Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack
Goodman and Debbie Klein The love
affair that shocked Europe See torrid
lovemaking at its most explicit See
Jack and Debbie expose their lust in
the sacred halls of the Vatican

Never has the screen dared

DAVID
If you dont stop Im going to kill
you

JACK
have to make love to her Its
very simple She has no choice really

DAVID

It just fascinates me that you can
spend so much energy on someone so
dull

JACK
It is impossible for a body like
that to be dull

DAVID
Weve known Debbie what since the
eighth grade How many years of
foreplay is that

JACK
She says she ‘likes me too much’

David just laughs and laughs and laughs
DISSOLVE TO
EXT EAST PROCTOR MAIN STREET - NIGHT

David and Jack entering East Proctor It is brightly moonlit
East Proctor consists of a few shops all closed a petrol

pump and a pub East Proctor has a very small population and
the place looks empty David and Jack enter the middle of
town and look about The camera sees what they see A few
shops dark and shuttered Light and laughter come from the
pub

EXT THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

Its traditional shingle shows a ferocious wolfs bloody head
ona pike and tells us the pubs name The Slaughtered
Lamb

JACK
The Slaughtered Lamb

DAVID

Of course The Slaughtered Lamb
Why else would they have a severed
fox head on a spear as their symbol

JACK
Thats a wolfs head

DAVID

Of course The Slaughtered Lamb
Why else would they have a severed
wolfs head ona spear as their
symbol

JACK
Thats not a spear Its a pike
DAVID
A severed wolfs head on a pike as
their symbol

JACK

David before we go in there want
you to know that - no matter what
happens to us - its your fault

DAVID
assume full responsibility

JACK
Okay

DAVID
Shall we

INT THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT

The pub was apparently modernized sometime in the mid-
fifties Its traditional Englishness combines with greasy

stainless steel and glass It is populated by mostly pale

young men with longish hair Several older men are ruddy
complexioned and sport large mustaches Four or five are
watching a chess game Two men are playing darts The
conversation is loud and there is often laughter But there

is something unsavory about these people A look of leanness

and poverty They seem inbred and somehow sullen We establish
the types and the general level of noise in the room

The door opens revealing David and Jack There is dead silence
and all are staring in a not friendly way at the two boys

who are made uncomfortable by all the strange attention
They give each other a what look then turn to the
assembled populace

DAVID
Hello

JACK
Nice to see you
FACES

Silent and staring
CUT TO

DAVID AND JACK

DAVID

(smiles)

Its very cold outside May we come
in

The WOMAN BARKEEP nods The boys walk carefully over to a
table and very self-consciously remove their packs place
them on the floor and sit down at the table There is a

long awkward wait The Woman finally comes over to them

JACK
Do you have any hot soup

WOMAN
No

DAVID
Well do you have any coffee

WOMAN
No

JACK
Hot chocolate

WOMAN

Weve got spirits and beer If its
something hot you want you can have
tea

JACK
Then you have some hot tea

WOMAN
No
JACK
Oh

WOMAN
But can heat some up for you if
youd like

DAVID and JACK
Yes please

As the Woman turns to prepare the tea everyone resumes what
they were doing talking drinking playing chess and darts

and the boys breathe easier

JACK
Nice looking group

DAVID
Listen at least its warm in here

JACK
Look at that

CUT TO
JACKS POV

On the wall is painted a red pentangle (a five-pointed star)
and on either side burns a yellow candle

DAVID
What about it

JACK
Its a five-pointed star

DAVID
Maybe the owners are from Texas

The Woman brings them their tea
JACK

(to Woman)
Remember the Alamo
WOMAN
beg your pardon

DAVID
He was joking Thank you

WOMAN

Joking remember The Alamo saw
it once in London in Leicester
Square

Jack and David look startled One of the CHESS PLAYERS
explains

CHESS PLAYER

She means in the cinema that film
with John Wayne

(turns to board)

Checkmate

DAVID
Oh yes of course

JACK

Right with Laurence Harvey and
everybody died in it It was very
bloody

CHESS PLAYER
Bloody awful if you ask me

This sends everyone into gales of laughter Jack and David
smile politely

CHESS PLAYER
Here Gladys Tom Did you hear the
one about the crashing plane

WOMAN
No but were about to

Laughter
CHESS PLAYER
You be quiet woman and let me speak

WOMAN
(heavy sarcasm)
Quiet everyone Hush Shhh

Uproarious laughter

CHESS PLAYER
All right laugh then shant tell
it

WOMAN
Oh come on tell us

CHESS PLAYER
No Youve had your chance

The men all coax him to tell the joke

JACK
(to David)
Ask them what the candles are for

DAVID
(to Jack)
You ask them

JACK

(to David)

Listen thats a pentangle a five-
pointed star Its used in witchcraft
Lon Chaney Jr and Universal Studios
maintain its the mark of the wolf
man

DAVID

(to Jack)

see You want me to ask these people
if theyre burning candles to ward

off monsters

JACK
(to David)
Right

DAVID
(to Jack)
Wrong

The drinkers have gotten the Chess Player to tell the joke
as everyone knew he would

CHESS PLAYER

Oh all right There was this airplane
over the Atlantic on its way to New
York It was full of men from the
United Nations

WOMAN
Thats very funny that is

Uproarious laughter

JACK
(to David)
Go on ask them

DAVID
(to Jack)
You ask them

CHESS PLAYER

Here now let me finish So halfway
over the ocean the engines run low
on petrol so they have to lighten
the plane So they heave out all the
baggage but its still too heavy

So they chuck out the seats but

its still too heavy Finally this
Froggy steps up and shouts Viva la
France and leaps out Then an
Englishman

DART PLAYERS
Hear Hear
CHESS PLAYER

(undaunted)

steps up and shouts God save the
Queen’ and leaps out But the plane

is still too heavy So the Yank

delegate from Texas steps up shouts
‘Remember the Alamo’ and chucks out
the Mexican

This is apparently the funniest joke the inhabitants of East
Proctor have ever heard The laughter is uproarious choking
knee-slapping incredible As the Chess Player goes to take

a drink of beer the Dart Player gasps out

DART PLAYER
Remember the Alamo

causing the Chess Player to spit out his beer causing
even harder laughter Complete hilarity

JACK
Excuse me but whats that star on
the wall for

Dead silence A dart lands in the wall David and Jack are
understandably bewildered The villagers look hard indeed

DART PLAYER
(angry)

Youve made me miss

JACK
Im sorry

DART PLAYER
Ive never missed the board before

DAVID
Jack wed better go

JACK
What do you mean Im starving

DART PLAYER
Theres no food here

The villagers look threatening and Davids voice is a bit
urgent

DAVID
Come on Jack shall we go

JACK
Apparently so

The boys pick up their backpacks and move uncertainly for
the door

WOMAN
(to men)
You cant let them go

DAVID
(worried)
How much do we owe you

CHESS PLAYER
Nothing lads Go God be with you

DAVID
Uh thank you

WOMAN
Wait You just cant let them go

DART PLAYER
Go And stay on the road Keep clear

of the moors

DAVID
Yes well thanks again

CHESS PLAYER

David pushes Jack out

EXT THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT
It is very cold

JACK
What the hell was that all about

DAVID

an inn or something up the road

JACK
Beware the moon

DAVID
Come on Im freezing

They start up the road into the night
INT THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT
It is quiet

WOMAN

DART PLAYER
(angry)

Should the world know our business

CHESS PLAYER

DART PLAYER

Then murder it is Its in Gods

The wax drips from the Pentangles candles onto the floor

EXT A ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT - DAVID AND JACK

DAVID
That was weird guess leaving was
the best idea

JACK

here and its three degrees Im not
so sure wouldnt rather face a
blood-thirsty mob

DAVID
Well not quite a blood-thirsty mob

They keep walking

JACK
What do you think was wrong

DAVID
have no idea

JACK
Maybe that pentangle was for something
supernatural

DAVID

see and they were too embarrassed
to talk about it because they felt

so silly

There is a flash of lightning that sends a ghostly
illuminating sheet of light over the boys faces The clap

of thunder follows loud and rumbling

DAVID
Please dont rain

Downpour The boys are walking in a deluge

DAVID
Of course

They walk getting soaked
JACK
Say David

DAVID

Im well aware of how pleasant the
weather is in Rome at the present
time thank you

Jack spreads his arms and sings

JACK
Santa Lucia Santa Lucia

INT THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT
The rain is loud on the roof and beating on the windows
The gathered continue to drink play chess and darts but

all are silent and contemplative

WOMAN
Perhaps theyll be safe in the rain

The Chess Player slams his hand on the table Shouts
CHESS PLAYER
No one brought them here No one

wanted them here

WOMAN
You could have told them

DART PLAYER
Are you daft What do you think theyd
say Theyd think us mad

WOMAN
Listen

The rain is subsiding There is a very faint howl

WOMAN
Did you hear it We must go to them

DART PLAYER
heard nothing

CHESS PLAYER
Nor

The camera lingers as the Chess Players hard face shows the
mans struggle Another howl The Chess Player turns suddenly

EXT ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT
David and Jack are now completely out of sight from East
Proctor surrounded by darkness and wet There is a light

drizzle They are standing listening The drizzle stops

JACK
Did you hear that

DAVID

JACK
What was it

David begins to walk Jack with him

DAVID
Could be a lot of things

JACK

The Hound of the Baskervilles

JACK
Pecos Bill

DAVID
Heathcliffe

JACK
Heathcliffe didnt howl

Another howl this one long and loud It is a very inhuman
noise terrifying and closer this time

JACK

Lamb

DAVID
Yeah

They are both visibly worried and walk briskly back from
where they just came Although after a bit of fast walking
they are getting nowhere They stop out of breath

DAVID
Were lost

Another bloodcurdling howl

JACK
Shit David what is that

DAVID

JACK
Come on where

DAVID
Anywhere think we should just

keep moving

A growl A low guttural growl comes from out of the darkness
We stay on the boys but we hear something out there It
starts to walk

DAVID
Its moving

JACK
Its circling us

And indeed it is The boys strain to hear its four footfalls
and they turn slowly following it A snarl

JACK
Fuck

We hear the wolf-monster stop (for thats what it is - we
know its there even though weve not seen it) It sits
breathing heavily

DAVID
Whats the plan

JACK
(nervously)
Plan

DAVID

(not too relaxed
himself)

Lets just keep walking

They do and David keeps talking as they walk
DAVID

Thats right a lovely stroll in the
moors Tra-la-la isnt this fun

The thing stalking them seems to speed up The boys hesitate
as they sense it run past them It stops

DAVID
Its in front of us

JACK
Do you think its a dog

Jack and David strain to see what waits ahead of them
BOYS POV

Something is waiting in the darkness Its hulking shape is
barely discernible but its eyes glow eerily and its breath

is visible

JACK
Oh shit What is that

DAVID
A sheep dog or something Turn slowly
and lets walk away

The boys keep talking as they move faster and faster

JACK
Nice doggie Good boy

DAVID
Walk away Jack

JACK
Walking away yes sir Here we are

walking away

They are in a full-out run by now After a few minutes flight
they stop panting

DAVID

It sounds far away

JACK
Not far enough Come on
They walk briskly

DAVID
Jack

JACK

DAVID
Where are we going

David shouts as he slips suddenly in the mud scaring Jack
and us and himself a great deal He lays startled on the
wet ground for a moment then he and Jack laugh

JACK
You really scared me you shithead

DAVID
Are you going to help me up

Jack takes Davids extended hand to help him up when
THE WOLF MONSTER SPRINGS
EXT MOORS - NIGHT

The lunging beast brings Jack down in one fell swoop David
falls back on his ass Jack is screaming and struggling as

he is torn to shreds David scrambles to his feet and runs

in complete panic Jacks screams and the wolfs roars
combine

JACK
Jesus fuck David Please help me
Please David Shit Help me Oh
God
EXT ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT
David runs and runs Finally he falls out of breath

DAVID
Jack Oh my God Jack

He gets up and runs back to find Jack a torn and bloody mess
on the ground He stares in horror

DAVID
Jack

EXT NIGHT - VARIOUS FLASH CUTS

THE WOLF SPRINGS The camera adopts Davids POV as he
fights the dark savage shape on top of him Fangs clamp down
on his shoulder when shots ring out and the hulking form

rolls off of him

EXT ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT

David dazed and bloody looks and sees the men from The
Slaughtered Lamb armed with shotguns and torches running
towards him Looking over at his attacker instead of a wolf
he sees a very old naked man laying in the mud riddled with
bullet holes As the villagers crowd around David falls

back and faints

plugged into a bottle of plasma There are several cuts and
abrasions on his arms and face but he really doesnt look
too bad He opens his eyes slowly blinks and tries to sit

ALEX

Doctor

She exits as Dr Hirsch continues his examination looking
into Davids eyes

EXT DENSE FOREST - DAY

dense greenery On the soundtrack are the footfalls and heavy
breathing of the runner The camera abruptly stops and turns
sharply looking about the panting continuing The breathing

LT VILLIERS

SGT MCMANUS

He may have a point Lieutenant

defend themselves against one man

LT VILLIERS

Sgt McManus are you suggesting

that David and Jack were in fact
attacked by some animal and that the
officialdom of East Proctor has
conspired to keep it a secret We

have an autopsy report on the murderer
who was shot in the act by the local
police We have two witnesses to the
crime Youll forgive me Mr Kessler

if consider your testimony as coming
from someone who has gone through a
terrible shock

lucid to me and

Alex holds up her head and proceeds to Davids room She
hesitates then peeks in

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

The curtains are drawn and Davids lunch waits patiently on
its tray alongside of the bed David is apparently asleep
Alex enters softly

ALEX
(softly)

DAVID
(lifeless)

ALEX

DAVID

ALEX

DAVID

cup)

Well youre to take these after

a task as giving out some pills

She opens the curtains daylight fills the room

ALEX

Kessler

DAVID
Call me David
ALEX

DAVID
This is absurd Im not hungry

ALEX

Alex efficiently removes the covers from the dishes and sits
on the edge of the bed Taking knife and fork in hand she
neatly cuts Davids food into pieces David watches all this
amused She places a napkin under Davids chin and holds up
his first bite on his fork David folds his arms and refuses

to open his mouth

ALEX
Lets try a little harder shall we

DAVID
Will you give me a break

Alex grabs Davids nose forcing his mouth open quickly
shoving the fork in it David is startled but amused and
chews his food slowly and swallows it Alex holds up another
bite

ALEX

Will have to take such drastic

action again David

David opens his mouth obediently Alex almost smiles She
feeds him for a while they are both sizing each other up

Finally

DAVID
May have a glass of milk

Alex smiles

FADE OUT
FADE IN
EXT DENSE FOREST - DAY

Again we are running fast and faster David again running
naked flying through the green forest He stops suddenly
ears perked he looks about and then we hear Jacks os
screams The voice of Jack screams

JACK (0S)
David David Please help me Oh
God David Oh my God

David turns in blind panic he runs (and we run with him)
desperately trying to find the source of Jacks screams

He comes to a clearing in the woods light streaming through
the tall trees Jacks screams halt in mid-word David looks

in disbelief at the clearing There is a hospital bed with
someone in it It is the same as Davids

David walks toward it slowly The figure in the bed lays

still It grows dark very dark and David looks up at the

full moon There is a howl identical to the one heard earlier
back on the moors David approaches the bed slowly fearfully
We hear ocean noises on the soundtrack the sound of crashing
surf David reaches out to pull back the covers lightning

and thunder cause him to hesitate for a second Silence The
camera remains on David as he pulls off the covers His face
registers total disbelief and increasing horror

We cut to the bed to find - DAVID He lies there pale white
with purple lips and death pallor

The camera begins to move in on the corpse of David

Cut back to the standing Davids terrified face then continue
until Davids death mask fills the screen The face remains
still for several beats then suddenly opens its bright yellow
eyes and red mouth revealing fangs in a bloodcurdling wail
which carries over in the

CUT TO

NT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

t is bright daylight and Dr Hirsch gazes thoughtfully
out the window

DR HIRSCH
Youve never had bad dreams before

DAVID

(upset)

Sure as a kid But never so real
Never so bizarre

Dr Hirsch crosses over and sits on a chair by the bed

DR HIRSCH
Did you get a good look at the man
who attacked you

DAVID

‘ve told you it wasnt a man It
was an animal A big wolf or
something A rabid dog

DR HIRSCH
(chewing on his glasses)
Yes

DAVID

Look Dr Hirsch know Ive been
traumatized but Jack was torn apart
saw him A man cant do that to
someone with his bare hands

DR HIRSCH
Youd be surprised what horrors a
man is capable of

DAVID
Did you see Jack

DR HIRSCH
No In fact your wounds were cleaned
and dressed before you arrived here

DAVID

Did you talk to the police in East
Proctor Did the cops go to The
Slaughtered Lamb

DR HIRSCH
really dont know

DAVID

Then why the hell are you so quick

to disbelieve me You yourself said

it must have taken incredible strength
to tear apart a person like that

DR HIRSCH

(rubs his forehead)

David please The police are
satisfied Im certain that if a
monster were out roaming northern
England wed have seen it on the
telly
DAVID
You really think Im crazy dont
you

DR HIRSCH

Believe me The Hound of the
Baskervilles was an invention of Sir
Arthur Conan Doyles And if youd
read the bloody book youd find

that Holmes discovered your house of
hell a fraud a fake

There is an awkward silence as David sits and Dr Hirsch is
embarrassed at raising his voice

DR HIRSCH

Now really David Youre far too
intelligent to go on this way When
you return to America want you to
seek out a competent psychiatrist or
psychologist or something and stop
this nonsense Youll be leaving

this hospital in three or four days
please remain sane At least until
you are no longer our responsibility

Dr Hirsch goes to the door

DAVID

Dr Hirsch

(pause)

‘d rather not be by myself

DR HIRSCH
Of course not David Ill fetch in

young Miss Price

Ahem A Word of Explanation It was
in Warwick Castle that came across
the curious stranger whom am going

his marvelous familiarity with ancient
armor and the restfulness of his
company - for he did all the talking
We fell together as modest people
will in the tail of the herd

INT KESSLER HOME - NEW YORK - NIGHT

We are at Davids parents house in New York His FATHER

sits reading the paper in the living room as his younger

BROTHER and SISTER watch The Muppet Show on television We
can see past the small dining nook where David sits doing
homework and into the kitchen where his MOTHER is washing

the dishes A peaceful lower middle class setting All is

tranquil and secure There is a loud pounding on the front

door

FATHER
Ill get it

The pounding continues

FATHER
All right all right Hold your
horses

(The following happens with shocking speed) When he opens
the door four beings open fire with machine guns blowing
him away The sudden burst of violence is terrifying and
unrelenting The four rush into the room and the family

looks at them in fearsome surprise for these men are not
human at all but loathsome bestial demons dressed as Storm
Troopers One kicks in the television and fires into the
kitchen blasting Davids mother David rises but is forced
back into his chair by one of the things and held there

DAVID
Stop

He watches in horror as his little brother and sister scream
in terror before they are brutally murdered The monstrous
Storm Troopers then set fire to the rooms The one holding
David pulls a knife and quickly slits Davids throat

David bolts upright in bed and looks around trying
desperately to gain his bearings He sees that Alex is asleep
in the chair by his bed Connecticut Yankee folded on her

considers waking her then decides against it He turns on
the lamp by his bed and reaches over to take the book from
Alexs lap David takes the book as gently as possible but
Alex wakes up anyway

Good thought for a moment was
the only embarrassed one in the room

There is an awkward pause

into the bowl of oatmeal and tastes is gingerly

DAVID
(in mock English accent)

He settles down to eating reaches over to butter his toast
and drink his juice While he eats we hear Jacks 0s voice

JACK (0S)
Can have a piece of toast

David looks over to the os Jack Jack behaving relaxed

and normal sits in the chair last occupied by Alex However
Jacks appearance makes his casual manner all the more

surreal He is as we left him butchered on the moors He is
covered with dried mud and open wounds Huge glistening gashes
abound on his body His face is scratched his throat is

badly torn and his hair is matted with blood In several

spots he has already begun to rot He is a remarkably gruesome
sight but his physical state seems not to affect him at

all

DAVID
Wonderful

Cut to shot of Davids bare feet on the cold stone He mutters
to himself imitating a newscaster

DAVID

An American werewolf was found frozen
to death today in the heart of London
England

He looks around and sees that there is a small window ajar
on the side of the flat about eleven feet off the ground
which can be reached by climbing a brick wall which he does
but not without damage to his bare toes

At the top of the wall is a cat that begins to hiss on seeing
David The hair stands up on its arched back and it glares
at David hissing and spitting David is disturbed by the
cats hostile behavior

DAVID
What did do cat

The cat is really acting fierce When David goes to pat it
cautiously it screeches and runs away David is by this
time not amused David manages to pull himself into the
window

He falls to his knees and then forward on his hands He
remains on his hands and knees trying to master his torment
but its no use On all fours he gives himself over to the
excruciating hurt and slowly begins to change

The metamorphosis from man into beast is not an easy one
As bone and muscle bend and reform themselves the body
suffers lacerating pain We can actually see Davids flesh
move the rearranging tissue His mouth bleeds as fangs
emerge His whole face distorts as his jaw extends his skull
literally changing shape before our eyes His hands gnarl
and his fingers curl back as claws burst forward

The camera pans up to show the full moon outside through the
window Davids moans change slowly into low guttural growls
We hear the four footfalls as the WOLF begins to walk As

the camera pans back over the room we see the front door
pushed open and hear the Wolf padding off into the darkness

Alex has David persisted in his
werewolf fantasies

Well yes but he seems to be more
upset by the death of his friend

DR HIRSCH
Has his friend appeared to him again

Yes

DR HIRSCH
What did he say

ALEX
David says Jack comes to warn him

DR HIRSCH
Warn him

ALEX
Dr Hirsch whats wrong Is this
more serious than know

DR HIRSCH

tried to investigate the attack

There are no records The case was
closed and now theyve misplaced

the file Davids lacerations were

cleaned and dressed when he arrived
here and yet supposedly no doctor
examined him before did The Goodman
boy is already in the ground so hes
no good to us So went to the pub

in East Proctor where was convinced
of two things

ALEX
Yes

DR HIRSCH

They were lying There were no
witnesses no escaped lunatic The
whole community is hiding the truth
of what actually happened up there

ALEX
And what else

DR HIRSCH

think the village of East Proctor

is hiding some dark and terrible
secret Im convinced that like
David they believe in this werewolf

Alex is flabbergasted

DR HIRSCH
Youve absolutely no idea where David
might be

ALEX
No He knows no one in London besides
me shouldnt have left him alone

Suddenly

ALEX
Surely youre not suggesting

DR HIRSCH

David has suffered a severe trauma

myself witnessed some form of mass
neurosis in East Proctor If all the
villagers believe that Jack Goodman
was killed by a werewolf why
shouldnt David And then it follows
that if he survived an attack by a
werewolf wouldnt he himself become
a werewolf the next full moon

ALEX
(bewildered)
Dr Hirsch

DR HIRSCH

Oh dont mean running about on
all fours and howling at the moon
But in such a deranged state he could
harm himself or perhaps others

ALEX
What shall we do

DR HIRSCH

Lets call the police and see if

they can help us find our wandering
boy

Alex dodges the cop and runs into the alley The officers
shout after her Dr Hirsch reaches the police line

DR HIRSCH
Alex

Alex walks towards the dark end of the alley

ALEX
David Is it you Is it true David

Shes almost to the end The Wolf lays in wait in the shadows
The police raise their weapons

ALEX
David

THE WOLF REARS UP In that brief instant Alex realizes it
will kill her

OFFICER
Fire

The guns blaze The Wolf falls dead Alex leans on the wall
numb The cops Dr Hirsch and Sgt McManus run to the dead
Wolf only to find David naked and riddled with bullets

Alex begins to weep
