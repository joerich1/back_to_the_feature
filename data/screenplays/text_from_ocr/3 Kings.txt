Saddam stole it from the sheiks I

divided his bricks into many
different stashes Just one stash
should be easy to take from his
surrendering army and that would
be enough to get us out of our day
jobs unless you reservists are in
love with your day job

great difficulty breathing Archie rolls Troys shirt
up exposing Troys chest with the bullet wound Archie
points to a spot on Troys upper chest near the collar
bone --

Chief squeezes a small tube of brown disinfectant gel
onto this spot -- the only sounds are the SQUIRT of the
OINTMENT and TROYS BREATHING

Archie looks nervous then focused as he brings the shiny
metal scalpel down Troy is in great pain as he watches
Archie plunge the scalpel into his upper chest Archie
twists the scalpel to open the incision wide --

There is a pronounced HISSING as trapped AIR RUSHES OUT
Huge relief comes over Troys face as he breathes
normally
REGULAR SOUND FADES BACK IN the first sound is the
GIRLS THIN INTERMITTENT HUMMING --
TROYS POV (FROM GROUND)

He tears open a short IV tube and plunges the IV into the

tube which he tightens
