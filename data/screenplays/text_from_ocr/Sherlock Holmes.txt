Sherlock Holmes
OVER BLACK

A furious clatter of hooves approaching

EXT STREETS OF LONDON - NIGHT

Dark icy streets seen through the sooty glass of a GAS
STREET LAMP -- shadows within shadows

Gas hisses audibly the lamp ignites casts a POOL OF
LIGHT

through which a TWO-HORSE CARRIAGE hurtles

- moving fast enough to keep pace with the street lamps
as they ignite in sequence as if the furious momentum of
the carriage causes London to light up in its wake

SUPERIMPOSE London 1891

EXT THAMES EMBANKMENT - NIGHT

Almost tipping over the carriage turns onto the Thames
Embankment hurtles through the writhing fog along the
icy river

We catch a GLIMPSE OF A FACE scanning the embankment from
under the canvas roof of the carriage and then the
carriage locks its brakes and fishtails to a hard stop
The steaming horses -- one black one bay -- whinny and
buck

DR JOHN WATSON leaps out runs back through the snow
along the embankment Late 20’s early 30’s he is a
wiry sun-battered veteran of the Afghanistan campaigns
with eyes that have seen plenty

CUT TO

DOWN RIVER two ponderous POLICE CARRIAGES make the turn
onto the embankment following Watson

CUT TO

Watson stops when he reaches a SINGLE SET OF FOOTPRINTS
in the snow vanishing over the edge of the Embankment
with no trace on the frozen snow-covered river ten feet
below
Watson’s footprints partner the first set as he follows
them to the edge

CUT TO

ANGLE FROM THE RIVER Watson stands over a GAPING SEWER
ENTRANCE in the Embankment wall

INT SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT

Almost invisible in the gloom of the sewer we see the
whip-like silhouette of SHERLOCK HOLMES

Holmes raises his hand until his pistol is pointing
straight up and fires a single shot the instant he does
he drops to the ground and rolls sideways He is very
quick

Two gunshots immediately ring out from the darkness up
ahead both slamming into the brickwork where HOLMES was
standing they are followed by six audible footsteps

Holmes aims his gun towards the muzzle flash counts six
beats shoots A groan and someone collapses Holmes
swarms his fallen target --

HOLMES
Where is he

-- sees that the man is past answering Then suddenly
far down the tunnel we hear white-hot screaming A
woman An ugly sound

Holmes takes the mans bowler hat and places it on his
own head significantly changing his silhouette

which melts into the blackness of the tunnel as he
heads fast towards the sound of the scream

INT SEWER JUNCTION - NIGHT

Catwalks meet above an island of stonework at the
junction of several sewers A good place for bad things

A YOUNG WOMAN lies on the stone island a splash of white
lit by flaming torches She isn’t screaming any more
Her eyes are wide perhaps in shock perhaps drugged

PULL BACK to reveal that she lies at the CENTER OF A
PENTANGLE painted crudely on the masonry OCCULT SYMBOLS
encircle her body and demarcate each corner of the
pentangle Strange disturbing ancient shapes
THE SHADOW OF A MAN (BLACKWOOD) kneels at the edge of the
pentangle Lips moving as he murmurs incantations he
moves to the next corner of the pentangle

CUT TO

ON THE CATWALKS ABOVE THREE HARD MEN in bowler hats
stand guard over this ceremony They turn fast when they
hear watery footsteps approaching from one of the
tunnels

Man 1 cocks his gun sees a figure in the darkness
bowler hat on head

MAN 1
Dez

A mumbled affirmative returns down the tunnel Relaxing
Man 1 uncocks his gun

- and is felled by a clinical right cross from HOLMES
as he explodes into the junction

Hard core hand-to-hand combat one against three The
bowler-hatted men fight with fanatic intensity

Holmes fights with cold control using a lethal -- and
very modern -- mix of martial arts boxing and street
fighting

CUT TO

Except for one quick glance up at the fight on the
catwalk Blackwood stays focused on his ritual but
murmurs faster

CUT TO
Holmes is now fighting just two then one -- not

realizing that there is a FOURTH BOWLER-HATTED HEAVY
creeping down the catwalk behind him

THE HEAVY draws his gun to shoot Holmes in the back
CLICK Sound like a billiard ball hitting a coconut

Holmes whirls as the fourth heavy sags unconscious --

-- to reveal Watson behind him brandishing a SHORT STICK
(18 inch hardwood club)

The men share a look For the first time we get a clear
look at Holmes’ face Holmes is shining magnificent
wholly alive
HOLMES
Excellent timing as always

CUT TO

LORD BLACKWOOD rises from his knees A few years older
than Holmes and Watson Blackwood radiates wealth and
dark power A formidable creature His piercing eyes
shine with reptilian anticipation

He steps into the pentangle stands over the woman It
looks as if this ritual is almost complete

CUT TO
As the final thug charges Holmes swings off the catwalk
and -- CLICK -- the thug meets Watson’s short stick
instead

CUT TO

Blackwood reaches down His RUBY RING sparkles as he
moves to caress her face --

-- and Holmes tackles Blackwood driving him out of the
pentangle

BLACKWOOD
You spoiled it

Something horrible happens behind Blackwood’s eyes A
psychotic flash that brings Holmes up short for a
moment

BLACKWOOD (CONT’D)
No matter The Dark One has the
others You weren’t quick enough
to save any of them

The girl has snapped out of her trance and is backing
away from them as best she can

BLACKWOOD (CONTD)
I wonder if you see their agony
when you close your eyes at night

The cruel words seemingly have no effect on Holmes
But Watson charges at Blackwood lays into him with his
fists Hammers him Blackwood sags to his knees

Holmes grabs Watson pulls him off

HOLMES
It’s over
A bubbling derisive laugh from Blackwood

BLACKWOOD
Is it

Holmes ignores him sees something up on the catwalk

HOLMES
Hello Inspector

LONDON POLICEMAN swarm into the junction

lead by

INSPECTOR LESTRADE a man who makes up for any

shortcomings with sheer doggedness

LESTRADE
Thank you Holmes Thank you
Doctor I wish I’d come to you
sooner

HOLMES
So do I

Lestrade reddens and proceeds to handcuff
cover up his annoyance

Blackwood to

Behind them the girl is helped onto a stretcher by two

policemen and carried away

Blackwood watches the girl eyes glittering

BLACKWOOD
We’‘ll meet again my dear I
promise
Watson lunges at Blackwood again Holmes

HOLMES
Turn your back on it

WATSON
He killed at least seven women
How can you be so detached
HOLMES
Emotion is the enemy of reason

EXT THAMES EMBANKMENT - NIGHT

Holmes and Watson walk along the freezing
towards their carriage

WATSON

holds him back

embankment

We should charge Scotland Yard for

the help we give them
(MORE )
WATSON (CONTD)
Especially since they take the
credit half the time

HOLMES
Yes but we have all the fun

Holmes opens the carriage door and climbs in He’s done
Watson joins him

The carriage moves away slowly disappears into the
winter fog

DISSOLVE TO

EXT LONDON - ESTABLISHING - DAY

Winter has become spring in the greatest city on Earth
Center of the Empire birthplace of the Industrial
Revolution London is rich fast dirty and exciting

Raw materials -- coal iron rubber lumber -- stream up
the crowded Thames and are transformed into luxuries and
necessities Everywhere you look something is being
built or torn down to be re-built bigger and better
Houses stadiums palaces bridges boats trains

Along with this modernizing clamor we see the rebirth of
spiritualism Billboards for seances and mentalists
upscale astrologer offices “By Appointment to Her Royal
Highness” palm readers on the streets fakirs on
soapboxes shops selling Ouija boards tarot cards and
black candles

Superstition and self-confidence combine to make Holmes’
London the thundering city it is

Everyone has something to do somewhere to go a fortune
to make or break Energy and optimism are the name of
the game --

INT 221B BAKER STREET - DAY

-- except in 221B Baker St a big messy two-bedroom
apartment where Holmes languishes on a sofa clothes a
wrinkled mess

Holmes is unkempt unshaven dull-eyed Evidence of a
long period of self-medication in the form of several
empty whisky bottles under the sofa

Unpaid bills are impaled on a bowie knife which has been
plunged into the wooden mantle over the fireplace

Bullet holes in the wood panelling spell out “VR” a
drunken commemoration of Queen Victoria’s birthday
Art animal skins and strange objects from the far
reaches of the Empire abound This is a bohemian
bachelor pad Victorian-style

Holmes’ eyes hardly move as WATSON ENTERS carrying an
exquisitely wrapped and tied SHIRT BOX

WATSON
It’s time to get up

Watson is happy cheerful and determined The contrast
between the two men couldn’t be greater

HOLMES
(sighing)
What’s the point Crime is
ordinary Life is ordinary This
world is ordinary And I have
no place in it

WATSON
Oh come on weve been through
this before You need another
case that’s all
(beat)
Blackwood dies tomorrow by the
way

Holmes couldn’t care less Watson tosses the shirt box
onto Holmes

WATSON (CONTD)
New shirts

Holmes shoves the box aside peevishly Watson goes to
the door opens it shouts downstairs

WATSON (CONTD)
(shouting)
A bath please Mrs Hudson And
some coffee Strong

HOLMES
Don’t bother Really

WATSON
You promised to meet Mary tonight
and I’m holding you to it

Holmes levers himself upright

HOLMES
You wouldnt
WATSON
Oh yes I would I’ve decided
I’m going to marry her I want
you to meet before I propose

Holmes is quite literally stunned This is the last
thing he was expecting

WATSON (CONTD)
(pleased with
himself)
I can’t believe I’ve actually
managed to surprise you I
thought you would’ve deduced it
weeks ago

Holmes shakes his head no As brilliant as he is he’s
useless when it comes to everyday things like this

HOLMES
But why get married

Now it’s Watson’s turn to be taken aback
WATSON

Because it’s what people do
Settle down

HOLMES
Not necessarily

WATSON
Ordinary people

HOLMES
I’ve never thought of you as
ordinary

WATSON

That’s exactly what I am An
ordinary doctor I’m going to set
up my practice and earn enough to
lead a nice normal life with
Mary

Now Holmes almost looks angry
WATSON (CONTD)
Arent you going to congratulate
me

Holmes levers himself to his feet --

HOLMES
Congratulations
-- and stalks out

WATSON
(calling after him)
Eight sharp at The Royale

INT THE ROYALE - NIGHT

A romantic French restaurant in a fine hotel Almost
every table is occupied by happy couples or groups The
kind of place you take the woman you want to marry to
meet a difficult friend Unless the difficult friend
doesn’t show up

We find Watson and MARY MORSTAN seated at a table made up
for three Watson has run out of patience

WATSON
We’1l just eat without him

MARY
Let’s wait a little longer

Mary is a pretty well-turned-out woman in her mid-20s
Not spoiled not silly not ephemeral A clear-eyed
modern woman -- with whom Watson is very much in love

MARY (CONTD)
I think it’s important that I meet

him

WATSON
So do I Evidently Holmes
disagrees

But a ripple through the room pulls their attention to
the entrance -- where Holmes stands looking out over the
crowded room He has shaved he has dressed his hair is
overlong but clean and corralled

ON HOLMES as he looks across a sea of happy faces He
was more at home fighting in the sewer than he is in the
Royale

He finds Watson and Mary and crosses the restaurant
towards them with the air of a wolf moving through a
flock of sheep All eyes on him

Mary suddenly looks a little nervous

WATSON
We’d almost given up on you

HOLMES
(clearly a lie)
I had trouble with my tie

WATSON
May I present Miss Mary Morstan

Mary extends her hand

MARY
I’ve heard so much about you

Holmes leans down takes Mary’s hand awkwardly

HOLMES
And I um I

Holmes’ failed attempt at small-talk becomes not-such-
polite scrutiny Still holding her hand he examines
Mary with a prolonged acute gaze

Mary shifts doesn’t know what to do

Watson clears his throat Holmes realizes what he’s
doing releases Mary’s hand immediately

HOLMES
Yes well I’m glad to see that
you didn’t punish your student
today It never worked on me
Mary is stunned by Holmes’ insight Watson sighs

WATSON
Why don’t you sit

But Holmes feels compelled to explain not sit

HOLMES

Watson told me you’re a governess
MARY

Yes I am
HOLMES

Your student’s a boy of 8

MARY
Charlie’s 7 actually

HOLMES
Then he’s tall for his age He
flicked ink at you today

MARY
(horrified)
Is there ink on my face

WATSON
No your face is perfect

HOLMES
There are two tiny drops on your
ear Almost invisible
(trying to soften the
blow)
India blue’s nearly impossible to
wash off anyway

WATSON
Please sit down

MARY
How do you know I didn’t punish
him

HOLMES
Well because --

And then Holmes notices Watson glaring at him

HOLMES
-- perhaps I should sit down

Holmes sits

MARY
I’d like to know Really

Holmes shoots Watson an apologetic look but he’s in too
deep to stop

HOLMES
Your necklace and bracelet are
matched South African diamonds
from Asprey’s flawless Not
(beat)
not the jewels of a governess
The lady you work for lent them to
you She wouldn’t’ve done so if
you’d punished her son not even
if he deserved it -- human nature
being what it is

Mary is beet red with embarrassment

WATSON
(angry)
Some human nature is
unaccountable In my professional
opinion

MARY
Well I did ask

Holmes and Watson sit in silence Watson’s anger brings
out the haughty worst in the detective The awkwardness
is rescued when the WAITER arrives with three menus

WAITER
Mam’selle messieurs

Watson and Mary read their menus together Holmes does
not Instead he looks at Watson and Mary deciding what
to eat They look every inch the happy couple

Holmes looks around at the room

HOLMES POV happy couples eating laughing talking
Suddenly Holmes hears no words He just sees their
mouths moving The sound of silverware clinking and
scraping on fine china rises to an orchestral roar

WATSON
(sharply)
Holmes

Holmes jerks back to reality

WATSON (CONTD)
Would you like to order

The waiter stands poised Holmes discovers that he is
sweating

HOLMES
Perhaps Excuse me My
appetite

Holmes bolts unable to stay in the Royale a second
longer Mary is visibly concerned

MARY
Was it something I said

WATSON
No it was something I said

OVER WE HEAR the roar of a BLOOD-THIRSTY MOB and the
MEATY THUD of a fist smashing into a face

INT BARE-KNUCKLE BOXING RING - NIGHT

Holmes staggers back from the blow He tastes his own
blood from a split lip It interests him

This isn’t just a fight for Holmes it’s an exorcism

He is stripped to the waist all sinew and gristle His
opponent McMURDO -- huge but flabby -- bangs his fists
together and moves in

Bets rage back and forth through the pressing crowd deep
in the flesh-pits of London

Holmes hawk-sharp gaze darts down from McMurdos face to
his muscles as they flex giving him just enough warning
to move his head so that a punch grazes him

McMurdo throws a storm of punches most of which Holmes
ducks or blocks He throws nothing in return sometimes
even drops his hand just using his reflexes to protect
himself

Frustrated McMurdo steps on Holmes’ foot traps him --
-- knocks Holmes down with a thunderous right

GO IN ON HOLMES’ BATTERED FACE pressed into the dirt

He is smiling This is just what he needed This is his
therapy

Holmes rolls over sits up shakes his head to clear the
cobwebs

HOLMES
Thank you
MCMURDO
For what
Holmes gets up
HOLMES

You won Well done

MCMURDO
Done We’re not done Not until
you can’t move pretty boy

McMurdo advances on Holmes -- who backs away

HOLMES
You don’t want to do this

MCMURDO
‘Course I do

HOLMES
Trust me You don’t

MCMURDO
Shut your yap and fight

His huge fist whistles past Holmes ear Holmes sighs
and DESTROYS MCMURDO with three blows so quickly and
so emphatically that for a moment the crowd goes
silent

Until Holmes gives them a shrug as if to say “I tried”
Then the place goes wild

EXT BARE-KNUCKLE BOXING RING - NIGHT

Laughing waving good night to fellow fighters and flirty
barmaids Holmes strides out of the boxing hall battered
outside soothed inside He has a BOTTLE OF BOOZE in his
hand

A PALM READER reaches out to Holmes

PALM READER
Read your palm sir

HOLMES
I’d rather not know

Taking a huge swig HOLMES smiles to himself and strides
off into the city -- his city the place hes most
comfortable here at face-value where no explanations
are necessary

He passes a NEWSPAPER HEADLINE that shouts

STEEL AND WEAPONS TYCOON LORD
BLACKWOOD TO DIE TOMORROW

Blackwood Bridge contracts
cancelled

Holmes doesn’t spare it a second glance

INT TOWER OF LONDON - BLACKWOOD’S CELL - NIGHT

Light from a candle Blackwood sits like a yogi on the
floor in the middle of the stone cell His wrists are
manacled He is naked from the waist up His HEAD IS
SHAVED his eyes are closed his breath deep and steady

Whether by tattoo or ink he has OCCULT SYMBOLS all over
his body (but not his shaved head)

The occult symbols are repeated on every stone in the
cell It is as if Blackwood and his cell are one
Spooky Powerful

Something moans in the air Wind Or something else
Suddenly Blackwood’s eyes shoot open his head raises
He springs to his feet grabs a tin mug and begins

banging it on the door

The SOUND OF THE TIN CUP BANGING becomes the SOUND OF A
FIST KNOCKING on the door --

INT 221 BAKER STREET - NIGHT

-- of 221B Baker Street The fist belongs to Inspector
Lestrade

LESTRADE
Open up It’s urgent

The door is opened by a sleepy Watson

WATSON
He isn’t here

Lestrade hands a PIECE OF PAPER to Watson Whatever
Watson reads on the piece of paper shocks him

WATSON
I’ll find him

EXT GREEN PARK - NIGHT

The SOUND OF DRUNKEN SINGING helps us locate Holmes He
staggers and serenades grumpy geese and swans with a
POPULAR LOVE SONG of the time The way he sings it the
edge to his delivery makes it clear that Holmes has a
very low opinion of love

INT BARE-KNUCKLE BOXING RING - NIGHT

The fighting is over Only a few people cleaning up
Watson enters fast looks around leaves faster

EXT GREEN PARK - NIGHT

Holmes yodels the last few bars of his song staggers
backwards into a bush He examines a leaf --

HOLMES
Ah Pyrus Rosaceae So soft

-- and goes to sleep Watson shakes him awake

HOLMES
Leave me alone

WATSON
You’re wanted at the Tower

HOLMES
Some other time

WATSON
There is no other time You’re
Blackwood’s last request He says
he has information he’1ll only give
to you

That gets Holmes upright enough for Watson to try and

help him to his feet -- but Holmes brushes him off
HOLMES
(staggering to his
feet)

I can do this myself

Holmes gets his bearings lurches away

HOLMES
Tell me something --

WATSON
What

HOLMES

Did you propose to her

WATSON
Not yet Not until my practice is
up and running

ON HOLMES the news that Watson hasn’t proposed cheers
him up enormously

EXT TOWER OF LONDON - DAWN

The horizon around the Tower is changing forever as the

HALF-CONSTRUCTED MASS OF TOWER BRIDGE explodes out of the
Thames its metal skeleton hacking jagged lines into the
sky

Near ground level workers untie and take down a
BLACKWOOD STEEL sign

Watson looks at the bridge as he and Holmes head for the
Tower entrance

WATSON
He’s going to die in sight of the
bridge he’s building

HOLMES
But not alone

Holmes indicates A LONG LINE OF EXCITED PEOPLE queue for
the execution An equally LONG LINE OF FINE CARRIAGES
assemble opposite them Holmes and Watson bypass them
all

EXT TOWER GREEN - DAWN

Inside the grounds of the Tower on Tower Green WORKMEN
add the final feature to the platform they are erecting --
an EXECUTION BLOCK

Holmes and Watson stop

HOLMES

Hanging’s not good enough for him
WATSON

It’s his right as a Lord of the

Realm

If nothing else has sobered Holmes up this grisly object
does the trick

HOLMES
Come on lLet’s hear what he
wants

WATSON
He asked for you

(beat)
Ill be here I want to see this
one through

Holmes nods and continues on alone
INT TOWER OF LONDON - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BLACKWOOD’S CELL -
DAWN

A pale and nervous GUARD leads Holmes down the corridor
past a number of empty cells

HOLMES

Where are all the other prisoners
GUARD

They were moved For their own

protection

INT TOWER OF LONDON - BLACKWOOD’S CELL - DAWN

Blackwood comes to the front of his cell as he hears
their approaching footsteps

He looks hale healthy and excited -- not like a man
about to have his head removed He is dressed in his
best Except for the wrist manacles he could be going
to a party

The guard backs away crosses himself again

BLACKWOOD
Sherlock Holmes the great
detective

Two powerful men posturing Except that Holmes is
battered and bruised hung over has a leaf caught in his
collar

HOLMES
What do you want

Blackwood stares at Holmes intensely Not at him into
him doing to Holmes what Holmes has done to so many
Hypnotic

BLACKWOOD
Come closer

Almost without knowing it Holmes takes a step closer

BLACKWOOD (CONT’D)
- Closer

HOLMES
That’s enough
BLACKWOOD
I’ve been thinking about you

HOLMES
I can’t say the same

BLACKWOOD
I want you to know that I respect
you

HOLMES

Again I can’t say the same

BLACKWOOD
Don’t take me lightly Those who
do suffer

HOLMES
Well you’re about to pay for
that

Blackwood thrusts forward so that his face presses
against the bars He whispers

BLACKWOOD
-- Holmes

HOLMES
hn (getting annoyed)
What

BLACKWOOD
Are you a patriot Do you love
Britain

Holmes has a headache coming on like a steam engine

HOLMES
What are you talking about

BLACKWOOD

Did you know that I’m related to
William the Conqueror on my
mother’s side He ruled London
from here From the White Tower
actually And so will I

(beat)
Our Empire has not reached its
full glory I’m going to change
that I have the necessary
courage So do you History will
reward us

(beat)
Join me
HOLMES
Join you You’re about to die

A knowing smile creeps across Blackwood’s face

BLACKWOOD
Do you really think you could have
caught me if I hadn’t wanted it
If it wasn’t pre-ordained Yes
I’m going to die But when I
return it will be with powers
granted me by the Dark One

himself

HOLMES
Well give him my best when you
see him

BLACKWOOD

I’1l let you do that yourself
Youll be meeting him sooner than
you think

Pity for such obvious insanity shows in Holmes’

HOLMES
That’s enough Blackwood I
suggest you make your peace
rapidly

Blackwood lunges at the bars
BLACKWOOD

I’m going to watch you die in
agony You and everybody else

eyes

Blackwood’s psychotic ferocity is chilling Holmes turns
his back and walks away If he weren’t about to have his
head chopped off Blackwood would be a scary enemy

INT TOWER OF LONDON - MORNING

Holmes runs into Lestrade and a PRIEST waiting to give

Blackwood his last rites

HOLMES
Double the guard on Blackwood
double the guard outside

LESTRADE
Why

HOLMES
Just a precaution
(to the Priest)
I don’t think you’re needed
Father Not for this one

EXT TOWER GREEN - TOWER OF LONDON - DAY

The Green is packed with people -- many of them RICH AND
ARISTOCRATIC Excitement builds NOTE the heavy
security

IN PASSING we catch a glimpse of a dark stunningly
beautiful woman working her way towards the chopping
block Wicked eyes wicked clothes Seeing a man’s head
chopped off will not bother her in the least This is
IRENE ADLER

ACROSS THE GREEN from Irene Adler we find Holmes just
as Watson gets to him through the throng

WATSON
Fancy crowd
HOLMES
(disgusted)

Friends in high places

WATSON
What did he want

HOLMES
Absolutely nothing

And then all conversation ceases as the HUBBUB SWELLS
from the direction of the Tower

Blackwood emerges under heavy guard Head held high a
superior little smile playing on his lips Blackwood is
led by TWO MEMORABLY POMPOUS OFFICIALS towards the
execution platform

Again he looks like the cat that ate the canary rather
than a man about to be beheaded

WATSON
He’s taking this well

As Blackwood is brought up the steps a HERALD turns to
address the crowd Lestrade is near the front

HERALD
Lord William Blackwood for the
crimes of multiple murder and
human sacrifice in pursuit of
Satanic rituals

The HOODED EXECUTIONER raises his axe behind him for a
practice swing

HERALD (CONTD)
--You have been sentenced to
death

and the blade slams down into the block

HERALD (CONTD)
Is there anything you wish to say
before sentence is carried out

BLACKWOOD
Yes there is

Flanked by edgy guards Blackwood struts to the edge of
the platform looks out over the crowd with blazing eyes

BLACKWOOD (CONT’D)
Death holds no sway over me I
shall return

The crowd shifts uneasily The officials around
Blackwood urge him to kneel but he ignores them

BLACKWOOD (CONT’D)
And when I do I will bring the
powers of Hell with me

The two officials try to get Blackwood to kneel before
the block but he is having none of it One of them urges
the executioner to help directing him to stand behind
Blackwood

BLACKWOOD (CONTD)
(struggling)
LONDON WILL BE MINE
The officials finally force Blackwood onto his knees --
when a GUNSHOT RINGS OUT the bullet thudding into the
execution block inches from Blackwood’s head
CUT TO

Holmes and Watson turn towards the sound of the shot

CUT TO

A WOMAN emerges from the edge of the crowd waving a
pistol screaming like a banshee

WOMAN
Gods fury take you for what you
did to my child

As the guards -- and Lestrade -- rush towards her she
FIRES AGAIN The bullet whistles over the crowd People
hit the ground screaming (Holmes and Watson do not)

A moment of chaos --

WOMAN (CONTD)
May he rip the flesh from your
bones and wrack you on the
wheel

-- which ends when Lestrade rugby-tackles her to the
ground

CUT TO

HOLMES
Now they can get this over with

CUT TO

THE EXECUTION PLATFORM The executioner hefts his axe
The officials hold Blackwood head-down on the block his
shorn head spasming with fury

The executioner raises the axe high above the block and
with Blackwood’s final scream echoing over the crowd the
blade slams down and sigh of release goes over the crowd

HOLMES
Let’s get out of here

Somewhat disgusted by the whole affair Holmes turns to
leave -- and sees something that stops him in his tracks

Watson follows Holmes’ gaze in time to see IRENE ADLER
lift a challenging provocative eyebrow at Holmes across
the blood-thrilled heads of the throng She mouths the
words “Hello Sherlock”

Watson whirls back to see the effect on Holmes

Quite pointedly Holmes turns his back on Irene and walks
away -- but there is turmoil in his eyes as he does

OVER the sound of a SINGLE VIOLIN -- a simple
repetitive melody

DISSOLVE TO

EXT 221 BAKER STREET - DAY

The same turmoil in his eyes Holmes stares out at the
rain from their second-story window and plays his VIOLIN

WATSON (VO)
Instead of gazing out the window --

INT 221B BAKER STREET - DAY

Watson circles an OFFICE FOR RENT notice in the
newspaper --

WATSON
-- maybe you could put your mind
to catching whoever’s stealing
horses
-- then holds the front page up for Holmes to see

ON NEWSPAPER HEADLINE HORSE THEFT RAMPANT IN CITY

Holmes dismisses it turns to watch the rain again
Watson joins him at the window

WATSON
Forget her

Holmes shakes his head

HOLMES
You know she’s still the only
one

WATSON
The only one

HOLMES
The only adversary ever to best
me

WATSON
That’s not what I remember -- she
tried to blackmail the King of
Bohemia with an incriminating
photograph and you stopped her

HOLMES
She stopped because she wanted to
She was three steps ahead of me
all the way Made a complete fool
of me

A wry smile comes to Holmes’ face as he thinks about it

WATSON
I hope you’re not going to try and
find her

HOLMES

Now that would be a challenge --
she’s always in the last place
youd expect

IRENE (0S)
(European accent)
Good morning gentlemen

The both turn to towards the door

and there she is IRENE ADLER -- an exotic
dangerous electric presence in 221B Baker Street

Holmes shakes his head
IRENE

You’re looking older Sherlock It
suits you

HOLMES
Something I can do for you
IRENE
Introduce me to your friend
WATSON
(irritated)

We’ve met before

HOLMES
Dr John Watson Mrs Irene
Norton

Irene extends her hand to Watson but looks at Holmes

IRENE
It’s Irene Adler again

Holmes looks at her ring finger Empty Interesting

IRENE (CONT’D)
Poor Norton simply couldn’t keep
up with me
(to Holmes
pointedly)
But then I’ve yet to meet someone
who can

WATSON
What can we do for you Miss
Adler

IRENE
Please it’s Irene

Holmes and Watson stand together at the window unmoved

Irene gives a European little shrug -- so this is the way
it’s going to be Okay

IRENE (CONTD)
I want you to find a business
associate of mine I pay well

HOLMES
I’m not interested

IRENE
His name is Frank ORiordan Hes
five feet one inch tall Red
hair Missing two teeth in his
lower right jaw

They wait for more but

WATSON
Thats it
(to Holmes)
Well unless he smiles at you in
the street it sounds like a waste
of time anyway

Holmes speaks to Watson without taking his eyes off

Irene

HOLMES
She thinks she can tempt me by
withholding information while at
the same time concealing her true
intent

Irene gives Holmes a dismissive little smile yes she

can

HOLMES (CONTD)
She also thinks she can buy access
to something she hasn’t got -- the
London City Police Records

ON IRENE score one for Holmes there

WATSON
What do you mean

HOLMES

A man that height with the temper
of a redhead is someone who starts
a lot of fights Messy ones in
public Probably how he lost the
teeth She’s betting that despite
the fact he’s in hiding its a
habit he won’t be able to break

IRENE
I never said he was in hiding

HOLMES
You didn’t have to He’s in
London but he’s not where he’s
supposed to be
(beat)
Who’s after him Besides you

The clatter of arriving hooves in the street takes Watson
to the window

IRENE
Why you are Sherlock

Their gaze holds aggressive combative

HOLMES
As I said --
DR WATSON
(looking out the
window)
The police
HOLMES
(walking to the

window)
-- I’m really not interested

LOOKING DOWN ON STREET BELOW they see a YOUNG CONSTABLE
leap out of a POLICE CARRIAGE into the driving rain he
looks up obviously heading for them

HOLMES
(turning round)
Not after you already are--

But Irene is gone leaving behind a SOFT LEATHER PURSE
heavy with coins Both men look at the purse neither
touches it

WATSON
She thinks you’ll take the job
anyway

HOLMES

We‘ll give it to a charity for
fallen women

Before Watson can react to that the YOUNG CONSTABLE
hammers on the door flings it open panting

At last

YOUNG CONSTABLE
Mister Holmes sir Inspector
Lestrade asks if you’1ll come to
the Blackwood Estate at once

HOLMES
Tell him I’m busy

YOUNG CONSTABLE
He he’s gone

HOLMES
Who has Lestrade

YOUNG CONSTABLE
Lord Blackwood sir
(breathless )
He’s broken out of his tomb

The ennui the irritability the inner turmoil

drop away and once more HOLMES BECOMES FULLY ALIVE

HOLMES
Oh has he now

Galvanized Holmes walks across the room to get his coat
and a GUN which he pockets But Watson doesn’t move

HOLMES (CONT’D)
Come on

WATSON
I can’t I have an appointment to
see offices in Harley Street

HOLMES
There are a thousand offices in
London But only one Blackwood

WATSON
And only one Mary

Holmes looks at Watson Watson looks back This is a big
moment between them and they know it Watson tries to
make it easier

WATSON
Why don’t we meet for lunch
afterwards You can tell me all
about it

Holmes has no choice but to satisfied by that

EXT 221 BAKER STREET - DAY

Holmes and Watson emerge from 221 Baker street together --
but Holmes gets into the police carriage while Watson
opens his umbrella and heads in the other direction Is
this the beginning of the end of a great partnership

EXT THE BLACKWOOD ESTATE - ESTABLISHING - DAY

Judging by the magnificent estate Blackwood comes from
old money and lots of it

The estate is decorated with generations worth of
ARTILLERY GUNS stuck in various decorative places as if
they were landscape art Some are old enough to be
covered in ivy a few look new and very menacing

We find the police carriage hurrying Holmes through the
grounds towards --

EXT THE BLACKWOOD CRYPT - DAY

Generations of wealth buried in a moss-covered marble
edifice the size of a small house set amongst overgrown
landscaping

Rain lashes against Holmes as the young Constable leads
him past a leering gargoyle and points him towards
Lestrade sheltering in the open door of the crypt

Holmes hurries eagerly towards a grim-faced Lestrade

LESTRADE
Where’s Watson

HOLMES
Being ordinary

Lestrade doesn’t understand but Holmes brushes past him
not about to enlighten him

CUT TO
INT HARLEY STREET OFFICES - DAY
A LANDLORD unlocks and opens the door to DOCTORS
OFFICES ushers Watson in
Watson enters the offices -- stops The rooms are warm

wood-panelled with leather chairs and anatomy charts
Ready to go and nice with it

Ordinary seems pretty do-able to Watson right now

CUT TO

INT THE BLACKWOOD CRYPT - DAY

Stairs lead UNDERGROUND where the Blackwoods lie
Ornate and grotesque carvings suggest that Blackwood’s
obsession with the occult was inherited

Light from police lamps show ranks of MARBLE SARCOPHAGI
with similar carvings

The newest whitest sarcophagus lies shattered on the
mouldy floor The coffin that was inside it is similarly
torn apart Lestrade stays close to Holmes

LESTRADE
(whispering)
Blackwoods coffin --

HOLMES
No need to whisper You won’t
disturb anyone

LESTRADE
(a tiny bit louder)

-- it’s been smashed open from the
inside

HOLMES
It looks that way

Lestrade points up the stairs

LESTRADE

The crypt door -- smashed open
from the inside

HOLMES
What are you suggesting

LESTRADE
(a bit embarrassed)
I’m just saying that in twenty
years of police work I’ve never
seen anything like this

Dead bodies are business as usual for Lestrade What’s
down here isn’t He’s more than a little spooked

Holmes nods all senses in hyper-drive He climbs the
stairs Lestrade stays with him

LESTRADE (CONTD)
You were at the execution You
heard what Blackwood said

HOLMES
It’s not possible You know that
as well as I do

LESTRADE
So who did this And why

HOLMES
That is the question

This is meat and drink to Holmes

LESTRADE
We know Blackwood started some
kind of secret society --

HOLMES
The Order of the Golden Bough

LESTRADE
-- with all sorts of top people
involved Cabinet ministers even
a Royal Maybe some of them

HOLMES
Maybe These are superstitious
times Easy to see how someone
could gain considerable power from
pretending Blackwood was still
alive

Lestrade nods uncertainly then stops at the crypt door
looks outside

LESTRADE
I hope you haven’t eaten recently
Someones been busy with a razor

EXT THE BLACKWOOD CRYPT - DAY

In a small clearing next to the crypt five or six
POLICEMEN circle something they can’t bear to look at

the BODY OF A SMALL RED-HEADED MAN who has had his
throat slit

Holmes bends next to the body a quizzical look on his
face

HOLMES
Hm red hair Lestrade may I
borrow your pen --

Lestrade hands over a NICE FOUNTAIN PEN Holmes shoves
it into the victim’s mouth levers his cheek aside to
reveal

HOLMES (CONT’D)
-- two teeth missing from the
lower right jaw
(to himself)
Didn’t think I’d find you so
quickly

LESTRADE
What was that

HOLMES
Nothing

Holmes returns Lestrade’s fountain pen Lestrade doesn’t
want to touch his pen

LESTRADE
Did you see he has no
fingerprints How can that be

HOLMES
I’ve no idea

LESTRADE
This is where Watson’s so useful

A look of annoyance flashes across Holmes’ face

Lestrade holds up a BATTERED POCKET WATCH by the chain

Holmes

LESTRADE
This was in his pocket

reaches into his own pocket pulls out a

JEWELLER’S LOUP screws it into his eye grabs the watch
flips it open and examines the lid obsessively for a

moment

HOLMES
Hm A drunk and a gambler

Lestrade has no idea how Holmes deduced that Holmes

shows him the watch

Holmes

Holmes
eye --

Holmes

Holmes

HOLMES (CONTD)
Scratches around the keyhole
Every drunk is the same And
pawnbrokers scratch the ticket
number and their initials inside
the lid This one has five so
the owner made and lost money on a
regular basis

shifts his gaze to the face of the watch

HOLMES (CONTD)
Oh and look

LESTRADE
What

looks up at Lestrade with the Loup still in his
an unnerving sight

HOLMES
It’s time for lunch

LESTRADE

How can you talk about food after
looking at this

flips the watch closed pockets it

HOLMES
This It brings my appetite back

strides away energized focused

Lestrade looks around -- shivers From the cold
Possibly

EXT LONDON STREET - EAST END - DAY

Holmes and Watson stride briskly along a busy East End
street eating piping hot FISH AND CHIPS out of newspaper
cones

WATSON
When I said lunch --

HOLMES
Come on these are the best fish
and chips in London

Lots of people on the street and sidewalks ranging from
street merchants to low-lifes to out-and-out criminals

A ONE-EYED WOMAN charges a penny a go on her OUIJA BOARD
so that people can “Talk to the Other Side” This is not
a safe neighborhood --

-- as evidenced by a RAG AND BONE MAN’S STOLEN HORSE
Irate he stands by his MAROONED CARRIAGE and waves the
CUT ENDS OF THE REINS as he shouts at a FLUSTERED YOUNG
POLICEMAN

As all this plays out

WATSON
You’re sure it was O’Riordan
HOLMES
Absolutely
WATSON

So Irene Adler’s mixed up in this
Blackwood thing

Holmes nods deep in thought gives the rest of his fish
and chips to a cluster of STARVING URCHINS One look at
their eyes and Watson follows suit They walk on

EXT BOW STREET - EAST END - DAY

Holmes and Watson turn onto Bow Street EVERY SECOND
SHOP IS A PAWN SHOP

WATSON
Shes even more untrustworthy than
I thought if that’s possible

HOLMES
Well she’s a complication Like
all women

Watson turns to argue -- then sees a pretty young
DAFFODIL SELLER with yoked baskets of bright yellow
flowers

WATSON
Over here

Holmes looks on with forbearance as Watson takes a big
bunch pays and tips generously

WATSON
(turning to Holmes)
They’re Marys favorite

But Holmes does not want to talk about Mary He has the
Loup back in his eye O’Riordan’s watch open He looks
at the inside of the lid

HOLMES
“MH” is --

WATSON
Maddison and Haig

Watson gestures with a shake of his head There was an
agenda behind the fish and chips after all MADDISON and
HAIG PAWNBROKERS RESPECTABLE DISCREET are right
across Bow Street

HOLMES
(pleased with
himself)
They should be able to give us an
address

Holmes launches across Bow Street Watson goes with him

WATSON
I’m going back to Baker Street

HOLMES
Look at that

Holmes points at a sign in the Maddison and Haig window
LARGE SELECTION OF ENGAGEMENT RINGS FOR EVERY WALLET

That gets Watson in through the door

EXT MADDISON and HAIG PAWNBROKERS - DAY

Seen through the dusty window Holmes talks to the
PROPRIETOR while Watson looks over a tray of INEXPENSIVE
DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RINGS

CUT TO

EXT STREET - CANNING TOWN - DAY

The streets in Canning Town are a cryptic tangle of cheap
lodgings for cheap labour -- unsafe unsanitary and
unpoliced Holmes and Watson move quickly through the
crowds Watson shielding Mary’s daffodils from being
accidentally crushed

WATSON
I have to get going

HOLMES
It’s on the way home

Holmes reads from the MADDISON and HAIG PAWNBROKERS
TICKET stops looks up at a LODGING HOUSE

HOLMES (CONTD)
This won’t take long

There’s just no stopping Holmes once he gets the scent
And if he’s being honest with himself Watson is
intrigued

INT LODGING HOUSE - DAY

No-questions-asked cash-up-front lodgings Holmes and
Watson wind their way up a twisting flight of creaky
stairs --

WATSON
How do you account for O’Riordan’s
lack of fingerprints

HOLMES
No idea

-- and find two doors
HOLMES

That’s his Look at the scratches
on the keyhole

Holmes takes out his knife goes to work on the scratched
lock

INT O’RIORDAN’S ROOM - DAY

Holmes pushes open the door and looks into a dank gloomy
room CURTAINS DRAWN

Watson sees an OIL LAMP on a rickety table -- lights it
There is a NARROW DOOR on the far side of the room

The room has been torn apart -- plaster and wood ripped
out of the walls spread around FLOORBOARDS have been
levered up or loosened A BED FRAME leans crookedly
against the wall

WATSON
Someone got here before us

As they cross the floor the loosened floorboards jump
under their feet Holmes rocks a floorboard with his
foot sees the other end flip upwards
HOLMES
I wonder what they were looking
for

WATSON
Holmes --

Watson points at a drawing on the wall -- an OCCULT
SYMBOL One we recognize all too well

Then they hear FOOTSTEPS ON THE STAIRS

Holmes pulls out his gun moves to the door opens it a
crack pokes his head out

INT LODGING HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

SEES FOUR ARMED MEN climbing towards them

INT O’RIORDAN’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Holmes ducks back in the room and locks the door

HOLMES
It’s a trap

Still holding Mary’s daffodils Watson rips open the
curtains tries to pull up the window --

-- and a BULLET SMASHES into the frame fired from A
CARRIAGE IN THE ALLEYWAY

A successful trap

FOOTSTEPS THUMP TOWARDS THE DOOR as Holmes crosses to
the narrow door pulls it open revealing a STEEP ATTIC
STAIRCASE

WE HEAR A KEY IN THE LOCK

Holmes darts up into the darkness Watson close behind --

INT ATTIC STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS

-- when a MASSIVE BLOW HITS the detective square in the
face throwing him back onto Watson The daffodils go
flying They tumble backwards down the staircase --

INT O’RIORDAN’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
-- back into the room in a heap on the floor --

-- where they are pinned by the FOUR MEN -- two on
Holmes legs and chest one on Watson’s legs the fourth
behind Watson’s head holding his arms

Both are too stunned to struggle
HEAVY FOOTSTEPS thump down the attic stairs

A SQUAT COCKNEY BRUTE with piggy eyes and ham fists
squeezes himself through the narrow door CRUSHES THE
DAFFODILS under one huge boot stands over Holmes and
Watson This is DREDGER

DREDGER
Didn’t think you’d be this easy

Dredger reaches down tears open Watson’s shirt to expose
bare flesh Then reaches into his pocket --

DREDGER (CONTD)
(to Holmes)
Your friend is to proceed you into
Hell

-- pulls out a STRAIGHT RAZOR flips it open to reveal a
wicked blade still crusted with dried blood

DREDGER (CONTD)
And you are to watch him go

As the razor descends Watson thrashes futilely

Holmes turns his head as far as he can from the sight as
if he can’t bear to look

MAN ON HOLMES CHEST
Dredger -- he’s not watching

The razor halts hovering above Watson’s flesh

DREDGER
Hes to see everything Make him

The MAN ON HOLMES CHEST puts his knees on Holmes’ arms
lets go his wrists grabs Holmes’ head to force it round--

-- exactly what Holmes was trying for

Holmes twists his body convulsively levers him sideways
frees one arm --

-- jabs a crippling sword hand into the throat of the MAN
ON HIS LEGS --

-- FREES ONE LEG KICKS the rickety table --
-- and KNOCKS THE LIT OIL LAMP into the air --
-- SPILLING HOT OIL onto the MAN ON TOP OF WATSON --

-- WHICH IGNITES when the lamp smashes into him
SCREAMING THE FLAMING MAN runs thumps into Dredger --

-- who flings him off (putting out the flames) discovers
that he is beginning to smoulder and flicker with flame
himself He beats it out with his huge hands

Top half freed Watson jackknifes upwards smashes his
forehead into the face of the MAN ON HIS LEGS

Holmes PULLS A DRAWER FROM A DESK SMASHES IT INTO THE
FACE OF THE MAN ON TOP OF HIM then finds his gun whirls
on Dredger --

-- in time to see the brutal cockney dive head first out
of the window

Holmes takes off out the door and down the stairs

Watson goes to the broken window looks out carefully
(half-expecting a bullet) --

-- SEES DREDGER roll out of the PILE OF COAL that broke
his fall and drag himself towards the alley behind the
lodging house

Watson picks up a fallen gun sprints out of the room
leaving four men in various states of disrepair

» and one squashed bunch of daffodils

Then the SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS RETURNING and --

-- Watson darts back into the room scoops up the
daffodils sees that every single stem is broken Angry
Watson drops the bunch onto the floor --

-- and coldcocks a recovering assailant as he sprints
out

EXT ALLEYWAY BEHIND LODGING HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Dredger limps out of the yard pulls himself onto the
waiting carriage

DREDGER

The DRIVER grabs the reins and takes off fast

Holmes hurtles out of the yard He raises his gun to
fire --

-- but has to dive for cover thanks to a HAIL OF BULLETS
from Dredger firing the driver’s gun

Gun in one hand Watson emerges from the yard in time to
see the racing carriage reach the end of the alley

The carriage turns to the right away from the row of
houses they have just left

HOLMES
That’s helpful

Holmes kicks open the gate into the yard opposite runs
across it and throws his full shoulder-weight into the
back door of the house

Holmes bursts out of the house next to a freshly
delivered PILE OF COAL --

-- just as the carriage bears down on him Dredger draws
a bead on him

Holmes ducks down into the yard grabs the COAL SHOVEL
and digs it deep into the pile of coal

The carriage thunders past the yard at full speed
Dredger’s gun points right at Holmes’ face for a second

Holmes arcs the shovel round hurls coal right into the
face of the driver

BOOM Dredger fires Holmes drops the bullet almost
parts Holmes hair

The carriage slews wildly across the narrow street the
driver fights for control

The carriage explodes against the opposite wall
Dredger staggers out of the wreckage and limps away
Holmes stands goes after him Dredger looks over his
shoulder sees Holmes accelerates

-- into a wall of noise as TEAMS OF WORKERS panel-beat
the enormous sheets of hull-metal into shape

HOLMES PURSUES DREDGER AT FULL SPEED through the
deafening chaos weaving around gigantic metal panels
(suspended from runners in the roof) hurdling the skin-
ripping tangles of discarded metal on the floor and
bouncing off unsuspecting WORKERS

EXT GATE THAMES IRONWORKS - DAY

Watson continues past the entrance to the FABRICATION
SHED runs along the outside of the building

EXT FABRICATION SHED - OTHER END - DAY

Dredger bursts out of the door and runs towards the FIRST
SLIPWAY which holds the PARTIALLY BUILT HULL OF A BIG
SHIP

But Holmes is right behind him and Dredger’s moment of
hesitation -- trying to decide which way to run -- is
enough to allow the detective to tackle him sending the
pair of them tumbling down the SLIPWAY

EXT FIRST SLIPWAY - DAY

Holmes and Dredger SLIDE TO A HALT at the bottom of the
slipway BENEATH THE TOWERING HULL They exchange
scrambling punches as Dredger hauls himself backwards and
finally kicks Holmes in the face Kick like a mule

Dredger is ridiculously strong

Dredger ducks under the framework supporting the ship
Holmes staggers to his feet and follows right under the
massive craft

EXT FABRICATION SHED - DAY

Watson runs round the end of the building and looks down
into the FIRST SLIPWAY

-- where he sees Holmes dart out from under the half-
built hull He looks across and sees Dredger weaving his
way through the support towers BETWEEN THE FIRST AND
SECOND SLIPWAYS

Watson’s sharp gaze continues across and up to the HEAD
OF THE SECOND SLIPWAY

- where he sees a DIGNITARY finishing his speech on the
CEREMONIAL PLATFORM FULL OF VIP’s who have gathered to
launch a MASSIVE GREY BATTLESHIP
Watson’s eyes widen as he puts two and two together and
he sprints for the ceremonial platform at the head of the
second slipway
EXT SECOND SLIPWAY - THAMES IRONWORKS - CONTINUOUS
Dredger comes out of the support towers under the
battleship’s hull reaches a sheer stone wall He turns
back the way he came --

Dredger look up as the HUGE CHOCKS holding the battleship
in place EXPLODE BACKWARDS --

A scream goes up from the DIGNITARYS WIFE as she sees
whats happening on the slipway

EXT SECOND SLIPWAY - CONTINUOUS

VAST COILS OF CHAIN begin unwinding off the ship as it
gathers speed exploding onto the ground like artillery

Dredger looks up at the approach of the huge propellers --
-- Holmes charges into him again before he can run
tripping him backwards across the runners Dredger pulls
Holmes down with him
HOLMES

Who are you working for
EXT BELOW CEREMONIAL PLATFORM THAMES IRONWORKS - DAY
WATSON sees the dwarfed struggling figures of HOLMES and
DREDGER on the slipway then the accelerating ship
obliterates them from view
INT SECOND SLIPWAY - CONTINUOUS

The noise is ear-ripping now as the keel gathers speed

Dredger grabs Holmes by the collar and punches him
directly into the path of the ship

Holmes lies semi-conscious eyes rolled back into his
head as the leviathan roars down towards him

The ground beneath him shakes bounces him knocks his
head against the runner -- once twice -- and he blinks
back into consciousness sees the great shadow sweeping
over him

Holmes rolls sideways as the massive propellers slice
through the air above his head and the gigantic hull
screams past him like the side of the world being torn
off --

-- and then the battleships away parting the Thames
with a vast frothy explosion of water

Holmes watches the ship drift gracefully out into the
river -- from the vortex to serenity in a matter of
seconds

His head collapses back great gulps of air disappearing
into his lungs He tries to pull himself to his feet
but Dredger’s bone-shaking punch has taken it out of him
and he sags back to the ground

Only when Watson arrives does Holmes get to his feet

He staggers back to the slipway to where Dredger was
standing

Nothing No blood or trace Nothing He’s gone

Holmes and Watson exchange a long look -- this thing just
got a lot more complicated and dangerous

FADE TO

EXT NEXT STREET OVER - DAY

Holmes Watson and various bystanders clear wreckage from
the smashed carriage to reveal the DEAD BODY OF THE
DRIVER

HOLMES
Now Where’ve you come from

Holmes kneels begins examining the driver’s shoes
slowly and carefully

Watson gets to work searching the man’s pockets

This is something they’ve done many times before They
don’t need to talk about it

Watson pulls a PIPE out of the man’s pocket turns it
back and forth examining it

ON HOLMES as pauses briefly to enjoy Watson’s
involvement then turns his attention to the hem of
the mans trousers

HOLMES
Ah

Holmes has found something in the man’s trouser hem -- a
small CLOD OF DRIED MUD He breaks it into his fingers
and feels the texture he smells it Then Holmes tastes
the dried mud like a connoisseur

HOLMES
River silt mixed with industrial
slag Sulfurous

Holmes looks at the soles of the shoes again takes out
his pocket-knife and picks something out of the tread

rubs it between thumb and forefinger with the air of a

connoisseur

HOLMES (CONTD)
That plus this fragment of ground
coal in his shoes puts him
squarely in Nine Elms somewhere
between Battersea Gasworks and the
rail depot

First generation CSI

WATSON
An industrial area That fits
Look at this

He holds out the pipe to Holmes -- one side of the wooden
bowl is blackened

WATSON (CONTD)
(mimes the action)
Lights it with a gas flame

They examine it together -- it is really badly scorched
WATSON (CONTD)
But the only thing that burns gas
at that temperature is a Bunsen
burner

HOLMES
Oh --

Something clicks for Holmes

HOLMES (CONTD)
-- a chemical laboratory Or
factory

Which then sparks Watson

WATSON
ORiordans fingerprints Day-to-
day handling of chemicals would
remove them

They’re getting somewhere This is what they live for
Watson catches himself -- he’s not supposed to be doing

this any more

WATSON
I really should be heading home
HOLMES
I need the Irregulars Would you
mind
WATSON
Not at all
HOLMES

Send them to Nine Elms --

Holmes turns to leave

Holmes knocks on the door bends his knees to mimic the
height of the short bellhop

IRENE (THROUGH DOOR)

voice)

IRENE (THROUGH DOOR)
One moment

A brief pause then the door is opened to reveal Irene
Adler wearing a silk robe --

INT IRENE’S ROOM - DAY

-- and a two-shot Derringer held low behind her hip
Holmes pushes in past her

IRENE
No package I’m disappointed

Holmes is not in the mood for games
HOLMES

What’s your business with
Blackwood

IRENE
None of your concern

Holmes looks around the room -- an explosion of perfumes
and expensive European clothing

HOLMES
I found O’Riordan

IRENE
I knew you would

HOLMES
He’s dead

Irene’s composure wavers for a second Holmes notes it
with satisfaction

HOLMES (CONTD)
Killed by Blackwood’s men for
betraying him Was he betraying
him to you

Irene arches a cynical eyebrow at Holmes it drives him
nuts

HOLMES (CONT’D)
What did you want from him

IRENE
You dont really expect me to tell
you that

HOLMES

Youll tell me
(starts towards her)
s Or youll tell the police

Which is when the Derringer comes out aimed directly at
Holmes heart Irene smiles cocks it

HOLMES (CONTD)
Youre not going to shoot me

Without taking her eyes off Holmes Irene points the
pistol at his foot --

IRENE
Oh yes

-- and pulls the trigger Crack

Holmes leaps sideways the bullet drills a hole in his
shoe millimeters from his toe

Irene cocks the pistol again Holmes moves incredibly
quickly snatches it away with one hand grabs her with
the other --

HOLMES
I’m taking you to Lestrade

-- which throws open her robe to reveal her underwear-
clad physique Perfect dimensions indeed

IRENE
Lestrade wouldn’t know what to do
with me

Holmes is momentarily stunned by the magnificent sight

Irene punches him full in the face knocking him
backwards

She goes for the door but Holmes grabs her and throws
her backwards onto the bed he stands poised for her
next move

IRENE
You wouldnt hit a woman would
you

HOLMES

Im a firm believer in equality
Irene rolls over off the bed onto her feet

IRENE
How did you find me

HOLMES
Beauty can be a disadvantage

Their eyes lock together over the compliment

HOLMES (CONTD)
Whats it to be Irene

She reaches out her left hand to caress his cheek --

IRENE
My dear Sherlock

-- and swings with her right but this time hes ready
for the punch and he throws her back onto the bed again

IRENE (CONTD)
You seem to want me here

HOLMES
You got the better of me before
Youll not do it again

IRENE
Maybe I want something different
this time

She slides up the bed onto her knees her face in front
of his

IRENE (CONTD)
Is it to be this

She slaps him hard across the cheek then grabs his face
with both hands --

IRENE (CONTD)
Or this

-- and kisses him passionately

HOLMES
Ask me again

She kisses him again enjoying it more this time they
break --

HOLMES (CONTD)
Im still not sure--

-- and she whacks him across the cheek again

HOLMES (CONTD)
-- which ones the more dangerous

He looks at her eyes blazing as she wipes her lower lip
with the back of her hand and this time he kisses her
their passions rising

As they break Irene opens her mouth to say something
and Holmes gives her a ringing slap across the cheek

HOLMES (CONTD)
Both have their pleasures

She turns and slaps him yet again but this time --
before he can react -- she tears open his shirt and grabs
him to kiss him again pulling him down onto the bed

Close intimate tender Holmes is as relaxed as we’ve
ever seen him Irene too

IRENE
I should have come back sooner
HOLMES
Youve been much too busy
IRENE
Hmm
HOLMES

Well the Tsar and his diamond
And then embarrassing the Aga
Khan And they’1ll probably shoot
you on sight in Belgium after
what you did to King Leopold

IRENE
(amused)
My name was never in the papers

HOLMES
It didn’t have to be

IRENE
Youve been busy too Your work
with the naval treaty last year --
that was impressive

HOLMES
That was Top Secret

IRENE
Was it I lose track

HOLMES
No you don’t

Holmes rolls over

HOLMES (CONT’D)
What did you want from ORiordan

Irene sighs Back to business

IRENE
All right

She slides on top of him and sits on his chest

IRENE (CONTD)
Since I like you

She holds his wrists pushing his arms up above his head
on the pillow lowering her face down to his

IRENE (CONTD)
ORiordan had access to something
my employer wants He agreed to
get it for me -- at a price His
death is a complication

There is a sudden click and Irene leaps off the bed
IRENE (CONTD)
But that’s what I get paid for --

the complications

Holmes looks up sees his wrist handcuffed to the
bedpost Holmes pulls at the cuffs then starts
laughing

FADE TO

INT HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Carrying an armful of laundry a MAID slips a pass-key
into a lock and opens the door

to be confronted by the half-naked snoring form of
Holmes still handcuffed to the bed

Her shriek wakes him

MAID
Ill -- Ill come back later

HOLMES
Wait Get me a screwdriver

INT 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT

Holmes enters to find Watson PACKING HIS MEDICAL BOOKS
INTO CRATES The sight brings him up short for a
moment

WATSON
I thought I’d get this done while
I had the chance

Holmes says nothing takes out his GUN and KNIFE tosses
them onto the table

Then he KICKS OFF HIS SHOES throws them in a waste
basket

HOLMES
(going to get more
shoes)
Anything from the Irregulars

WATSON
Not yet

Watson crosses to the waste basket puzzled by the shoes

CUT TO

When Holmes returns freshly shod he sees Watson
examining his perforated shoe in a very Holmes-like way

HOLMES
What are you doing

WATSON
The last time I saw you you
didn’t have a bullet hole in your
shoe

Holmes finds this tiresome He takes Irene’s handcuffs
out of his pocket tosses them on a cluttered dresser
Watson’s eyebrows raise theatrically when he sees them

WATSON (CONTD)
Small caliber gun A Derringer
I’d say At any rate a woman’s
gun
(beat)
I know only one woman whod
actually pull the trigger

Holmes doesn’t take well to embarrassment

HOLMES
(grumpily)
I want you to know I got valuable
information

WATSON
Oh

HOLMES
Whoever she’s working for paid
ORiordan to steal something from
Blackwood

WATSON
Such as

HOLMES
I don’t know But Blackwood’s
principal business is munitions
so --

A KNOCK ON THE DOOR interrupts

HOLMES
Who is it

WIGGINS
(through door)
Me sir Wiggins

CUT TO

WIGGINS is the oldest of the Irregulars

WIGGINS
Stillwell Chemicals It’s the
only one in Nine Elms It’s on
the river But they shut it down
this afternoon On account of the
shindig they’re having tonight
Big to-do Bosses and toffs
coming out of yer ears according
to one of the stokers Some kind
of celebration

Holmes and Watson exchange a long look This sounds
promising

HOLMES
Thank you Wiggins Good work

Holmes picks up the PURSE FULL OF COINS IRENE LEFT
tosses it to Wiggins

WIGGINS
Blimey

HOLMES
Be fair with it

WIGGINS
Easy to be fair with this much
money

Wiggins leaves before anyone changes their minds about
the money

HOLMES
Bosses and toffs We’1ll have to
dress the part

Watson shakes his head emphatically

WATSON
Not we You
(beat)
I meant what I said before I
need to get on with my life

Holmes turns away so that Watson doesn’t see his
disappointment

HOLMES
Suit yourself

CUT TO

Holmes strides down the hall looking devastating in
evening wear

As Holmes walks past Watson looks up from a crate of
books

WATSON
Good luck

HOLMES
Luck has nothing to do with it

Holmes crosses to the table to get his knife and gun He
PICKS UP THE GUN first --

-- then making sure Watson isn’t looking PUTS THE GUN
BACK ON THE TABLE leaves with a sly twinkle in his
eyes

ON WATSON as the front door clicks closed behind Holmes
staying behind feels strange He dusts off another book
packs it

EXT NINE ELMS - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

An industrial area on a torpid bend of the Thames Work
doesn’t stop when the sun goes down

We see a vast GASWORKS belching smoke glowing with
furnace fire Pyramids of coal and sulfur crowd the
wharf area

Next a TALLOWS glistening with rendered animal fat

Then a FILTHY BRICK WALL 20 feet high topped with
shards of glass The wall goes on and on and on
A block long broken only by a huge gate closed

Anything could happen behind these walls and nobody
would ever know

This is the STILLWELL CHEMICAL WORKS It says so on the
gate

EXT CHEMICAL WORKS - NIGHT

ACROSS THE ROAD deep in the shadows of a claustrophobic
alley we spot the movement the shining eyes of two

restless horses

They are hitched to a very nice CLOSED CARRIAGE

INT CLOSED CARRIAGE - NIGHT

Dark Holmes pulls out his watch flips it open angles
it to catch whatever light there is

Holmes settles in to wait

CUT TO

INT 221B BAKER STREET - NIGHT

Face heavy with thought Watson heads across the living
room with another arm load of books then sees something
that stops him in his tracks --

-- HOLMES’ GUN AND KNIFE on the table

ON WATSON Decision time

CUT TO

EXT LONDON - VARIOUS - NIGHT

CLOCKS RING MIDNIGHT all over London A glorious
cacophony but also the beginning of the witching
hour

EXT NINE ELMS - NIGHT

As the last chime echoes and dies another sound fills
the night air HOOVES AND WHEELS ON COBBLES coming from
all directions Lots and lots of them The streets
echo

INT CLOSED CARRIAGE - NIGHT

Holmes sits up straight pulls down the window and the
staccato sound echoes into the carriage

EXT CHEMICAL WORKS - NIGHT

CARRIAGES APPROACH from every angle homing in on the
chemical works gate Not just any carriages -- the
equivalent of Rolls Royces Bentleys Mercedes’

(NOTE these are the same fine carriages we saw at
Blackwood’s beheading )

The CHEMICAL WORKS GATE rumbles open and the carriages
stream in

INT CLOSED CARRIAGE - NIGHT

A discreet rap on the door it opens WATSON PULLS
HIMSELF IN tosses Holmes’ gun and knife onto the seat
next to him Watson is wearing his EVENING CLOTHES

WATSON
You left these

HOLMES
That was careless of me

Holmes grins unable to conceal his pleasure

WATSON
This is the last time
(beat)
I told Wiggins to get Lestrade if
we weren’t out in an hour

Holmes reaches down retrieves a SMALL CASE from under
the seat

HOLMES
We’1ll need this
EXT CHEMICAL WORKS - NIGHT

Holmes’ carriage joins the back of the line into the
chemical works moving slowly

Once they are through the gate rumbles closed behind
them

EXT BEHIND THE CHEMICAL WORKS WALLS - NIGHT

Behind the brick walls are ACRES OF WAREHOUSES and
enough outdoor space to hold all the carriages plus
mounds piles barrels of RAW MATERIALS
ARISTOCRATS CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY MINOR ROYALS
disembark from the carriages and head for a central
WAREHOUSE DOOR --

EXT WAREHOUSE - CHEMICAL WORKS - NIGHT

-- guarded by TWO BOWLER-HATTED FOLLOWERS

We recognize them -- they are two of Dredger’s crew from
earlier and bear the bruises to prove it They
scrutinize the guests as they pass

Backs to us HOLMES AND WATSON JOIN THE LINE into the
door wait their turn to run the gauntlet They don’t
seem to realize the danger they are in

Lambs to the slaughter

ON THE FOLLOWERS as Holmes and Watson reach them Sharp
aggressive eyes rake them

- and move on

REVERSE ANGLE as Holmes and Watson saunter into the
warehouse We see their faces They are HEAVILY
DISGUISED -- one of Holmes’ specialities (Facial hair
aging eye glasses etc)

INT WAREHOUSE - CHEMICAL WORKS - NIGHT

Torches gutter from the walls casting unreal light The
air is THICK WITH PALE SMOKE which adds to the eeriness

Music comes from a QUARTET OF BLINDFOLDED MUSICIANS

People mill quietly The tension in the air seems
amplified No smiles no laughter As they look around
Holmes and Watson hear snippets of conversation -- every
single sentence referring to Blackwood

WATSON
Isn’t that Sir--

HOLMES
Yes

WATSON
And that’s the Royal--

HOLMES
The entire membership of the Order
of the Golden Bough all in once
place Quite the celebration

WATSON
(coughing due to
smoke)
I’ve been to livelier funerals

There is a focal point of people in the middle of the
space Holmes and Watson make for it --

HOLMES
Fear will ruin a party every time

-- and find themselves looking down at BLACKWOOD’S
FAVORITE OCCULT SYMBOL Huge slightly raised off the
floor the symbol is made up of the raw materials of the
age the black of coal the white of lime the red of
iron the yellow of sulfur Like a giant sand painting --

-- and also the SOURCE OF THE SMOKE which seeps out
through it and billows around them It is as if this
symbol is a direct doorway to the underworld

Holmes glances to his right then looks with full force
at IRENE wearing an absolutely stunning evening gown
She turns towards him slips her arm through his

IRENE
I enjoyed this afternoon
immensely by the way

HOLMES
At my expense Again

IRENE
You can afford it

WATSON
What are you doing here

IRENE
I never miss a good party

Holmes laughs then frowns puzzled
The OCCULT SYMBOL suddenly PULSATES like a living thing

THE MUSIC CHANGES TENOR RISING SLOWLY AND RHYTHMICALLY
TOWARDS A CRESCENDO

The occult symbol writhes alive

HOLMES
Did you

He turns to Irene

HOLMES
- did you see that

Irene turns IN SLOW MOTION to Holmes
IRENE
(low slow)
See what
THE MUSIC PICKS UP A NOTCH

Shocked Holmes turns towards Watson It takes forever

HOLMES
Watson

Watson turns his image strobing in the flickering
torchlight

WATSON
(lower slower)
- Whaaaaat

Holmes opens his mouth to speak but he can’t His eyes
widen

All around movement and faces swim whirl strobe

Holmes raises his hand to his mouth bites down hard on
himself The pain brings him back for a moment

HOLMES
we’ve been drugged it’s the
smoke

THE MUSIC IS REALLY LOUD

HOLMES (CONT’D)
fight it

He grabs Watson’s hand Irene’s hand squeezes hard
hurting them

HOLMES (CONT’D)
fight it

SUDDENLY AN ECSTATIC SCREAM splits the air

The music stops
The silence is deafening
It’s clear that something big is about to happen

The occult symbol begins to hiss and crackle giving off
clouds of acrid smoke that make everybody recoil

Another otherworldly scream
Fear verges into panic
The entire symbol bursts into flames
Everyone pushes backwards chaotically Women faint
IRENE
(pointing)
Look

Behind the flames a form takes shape

SOMEONE
He’s here

The form of a man

SOMEONE ELSE
He has returned

BLACKWOOD STEPS OUT OF THE FIRE smouldering
He looks bigger brighter more alive than ever before

ON HOLMES An expression we’ve never seen on his face
before -- UTTER SHOCK

BLACKWOOD
Kneel

Everyone drops to one knee Holmes Watson and Irene
half a beat late

Irene looks at Holmes Watson looks at Holmes -- but
Holmes is still reeling Bewildered

WATSON
(whispering)
How can he be alive

Holmes shakes his head He doesn’t know

Blackwood starts to prowl and strut through the kneeling
horde

BLACKWOOD
Now Are there any left among you
who do not believe

Utter silence

BLACKWOOD (CONTD)
You

He points to a kneeling man who shakes his head
Blackwood moves closer to Holmes Watson and Irene

BLACKWOOD (CONTD)
(pointing to another)
You perhaps

Another petrified head shakes

Blackwood takes a few more steps stands right over
Holmes who keeps his head down in shadow

Blackwood points not at Holmes -- at a WOMAN wearing an
expensive gown just behind him

BLACKWOOD (CONTD)
Stand

The woman rises in terror Blackwood stalks between
Holmes and Irene helps the woman to her feet

BLACKWOOD (CONTD)
Do you believe

WOMAN
(voice trembling)
Yes my Lord

Blackwood stares into her eyes puts his hand to her
face

BLACKWOOD
No You don’t

His RUBY RING sparkles as he caresses his hand down the
side of the WOMANS face Her eyes widen suddenly and
she sinks to the ground --

-- right next to Watson who watches her spasm and die

People recoil Fear and awe wash the room Blackwood
has them every last one of them

BLACKWOOD (CONT’D)
The Dark One has returned me to
you --

Blackwood stalks away moving through the kneeling
throng

BLACKWOOD (CONTD)
-- with a great blessing

Big VATS are brought into the kneeling throng by
Blackwood’s Followers What looks like CEREMONIAL WINE
is ladled out of the vats into cups which are passed out
into the crowd

BLACKWOOD (CONTD)
Through His blood I give you the
gift of life

A cup is thrust under Holmes’ nose He has no choice but
to drink from it -- as do Watson and Irene

BLACKWOOD (CONTD)
You are the faithful You will be
spared But they will not

Blackwood stalks towards the corner of the room and
turns

BLACKWOOD (CONTD)
London will be ours And with it
the Empire A new Empire -- not
this pallid timid partial thing
we have now

Blackwood pauses radiant The silence is profound No
one even dares to breath

BLACKWOOD (CONTD)
By the power of the Dark One
himself I promise you this
(beat)

today at noon the Queen will
open parliament and every one of
those decadent fools who call
themselves her government will be
in attendance I will touch them
all

(beat)
The old order will be sacrificed
to make way for the new

(beat)
And we will demonstrate our new
power to the world in such a way
that they will tremble and fall to
their knees before the might of
the British Empire

BOOOM A LOUD EXPLOSION A huge SEMI-CIRCLE OF FIRE
erupts between Blackwood and his followers The flames
rush towards him sweep in towards the wall and are
swallowed up by the darkness

Blackwood is gone Vanished
Leaving shrieking shocked milling growing chaos behind
him People are trampled as the crowd floods towards the

door

Watson is pushed into Irene They stumble over the body
of the dead woman look down at her

IRENE
All he did was touch her

Watson rips off his disguise

WATSON
Where’s Holmes

They can’t find him
CUT TO

Holmes is at the corner of the warehouse where Blackwood
disappeared

He feels along the floor for a trapdoor Nothing Then
he lights a match looks at the wood-panelled wall
examining the grain He sees something --

-- pulls out his pocket-knife and scratches the letter
H into a specific panel then pushes on a KNOT IN THE
WOOD

INT CORRIDOR - CHEMICAL WORKS - NIGHT
A HIDDEN DOOR pops open and Holmes slips through but the
top of the door hits a trip-switch as it opens and the

second click makes Holmes look up

He sees the wire of a SILENT ALARM running along the roof
of the corridor --

-- which means that he does not see Dredger standing
right behind him COSH raised high

The cosh drops viciously towards Holmes’ head

SHOCK CUT TO
BLACK

FADE IN

INT THE HORSE TANK - CHEMICAL WORKS - NIGHT
In a SEALED GLASS TANK the size of an Olympic pool --

-- we find ROWS OF DEAD HORSES hanging upside down from
the roof suspended by their hooves

EVERY HORSE IS BLACK BLACKWOOD’S OCCULT SYMBOL has been
painted in white onto the horses’ flanks Their long
necks arch downwards their tails and manes hang limp

As if this were not surreal enough --

-- each horse has a CURVED GLASS TUBE protruding from its
swollen belly The inside of these tubes is coated with
a fine clear powdery residue They join a MUCH THICKER
GLASS PIPE running between the rows of horses towards
DISTILLATION EQUIPMENT

INT LABORATORY - CHEMICAL WORKS - NIGHT

This horrible vision is what HOLMES SEES as his eyes
flutter open He has been positioned to see it

His disguise has been ripped off and tossed aside his
knife and gun are on a nearby lab bench his hands are
tied behind his back and he has been propped on a lab
stool

Dredger holds him upright A FOLLOWER keeps a gun on
him from behind

The walls behind him are also thick glass showing more
darkened laboratories beyond

BLACKWOOD
I have a question for you

Blackwood is every inch the victor

BLACKWOOD (CONTD)
How does it feel to realize that
everything you thought about the
world is utterly wrong To see
your beloved reason and logic
annihilated before your very eyes

Holmes shakes his head groggy tries to clear it

BLACKWOOD (CONT’D)
Dredger cut off his head

Dredger is surprised but pulls out his razor

DREDGER
Might take me a while

Holmes is starting to look distinctly nervous

BLACKWOOD
Be careful of his face That I
may want to keep Depending on
his expression

Dredger moves in with his razor

BLACKWOOD (CONT’D)
In the end you were a poor match
Sherlock Holmes

Suddenly GUNSHOTS ECHO through the factory over the
rising SHOUTS FROM THE GUESTS and the blasts of POLICE
WHISTLES

Holmes smiles at Blackwood -- it’s not over yet

Blackwood loses his easy air of triumph He turns to the
follower

BLACKWOOD
Load everything onto the boat

The follower hurries down a staircase in the corner

BLACKWOOD (CONTD)
Still enough time to enjoy you
though

Dredger grabs a fistful of Holmes’ hair exposes his
throat

DREDGER
Brace yourself

Holmes struggles Dredger brings the razor around in
front of Holmes’ face slowly and sadistically -- then
lowers it to his throat

CLOSE-UP Holmes plants his feet firmly on the cross-
piece of the stool --

-- which is when THE GLASS WALL EXPLODES INWARDS the
heavy BARREL that broke it flying into the room with the
broken glass

Blackwood turns and dives down the staircase

Holmes pistons himself upwards his skull smashing into
Dredger’s face The razor shaves a section of Holmes’
eyebrow as it jerks past his face

Watson and Irene pick their way in through the glass
Irene takes aim at Dredger

CRACK Irene fires her little gun just missing Dredger
Dredger takes a quick look at Watson and Irene then at
LESTRADE AND THE POLICE POURING INTO the other end of the

factory -- and takes off as fast as he can

ON WATSON AND IRENE as they react to the horses for a
moment

HOLMES
Cut me loose

Both Irene and Watson go to cut the ropes binding Holmes
HOLMES
(to Watson)

Stop Blackwood He’s got a boat

at the wharf
Watson heads down the stairs after Blackwood and Dredger
Irene saws at Holmes’ ropes with her knife They’1ll only
be half a beat behind Watson
EXT WHARF - CHEMICAL WORKS - NIGHT
Dredger exits the chemical works sprints across the
wharf towards a black and red STEAM LAUNCH (a military
prototype) where Blackwood and his core Followers wait

CUT TO

ANOTHER ANGLE
Watson exits sees Dredger and stops The very sight of
him shakes Watson -- but that doesn’t stop him gathering
his courage and charging across the wharf towards the
steam launch

EXT BLACKWOOD’S LAUNCH - NIGHT

Dredger vaults into the launch Blackwood covers him
with a gun

Watson charges into danger

INT CORRIDOR - CHEMICAL WORKS

Holmes leads the charge down the corridor followed by
Irene Lestrade and half of the LONDON POLICE FORCE
They pick up speed

EXT WHARF - CHEMICAL WORKS - NIGHT

Holmes bursts out onto the wharf -- just in time to see
Blackwood drawing a bead on Watson

HOLMES
Watson

Watson dives behind a pallet stacked with barrels

EXT BLACKWOOD’S LAUNCH - NIGHT

Blackwood’s gun barrel tracks past Watson and finds the
first of the GAS STORAGE TANKS

EXT WHARF - CHEMICAL WORKS - NIGHT

The crack of the shot is drowned by the almighty roar of
the GAS TANK EXPLODING The wharf is engulfed in flames

CUT TO
As the gaseous fireball rises into the night sky
Blackwood’s steam launch pulls away onto the dark Thames
EXT STEAM LAUNCH - NIGHT
Blackwood stands in the bow not bothering to hide He
truly seems invincible
EXT WHARF - CHEMICAL WORKS - NIGHT
Whether from the shock of the explosion or the shock of
seeing Blackwood alive not a single policeman makes any
kind of move to follow or stop him They just watch him
disappear down the Thames

CUT TO

DOWN THE WHARF

FOLLOWER
You see There’s nothing you can
do Everything he predicted has
come to pass You cannot stop
him

CUT TO

HORROR ON HOLMES’ FACE as he pulls his jacket up over his
head and CHARGES INTO THE FLAMES looking for Watson

The wharf is a mess of flaming smoking smouldering
debris Holmes whirls this way and that looking
desperately for his friend

but Watson is gone Holmes stands there fighting to
maintain himself

LESTRADE
Up there

Holmes looks

Thirty feet above the wharf A FIGURE LIES TANGLED in the
LOADING BASKET of a dock side CRANE

Watson He looks lifeless

Holmes leaps for the CRANE CAB works the controls to
lower the basket The second it reaches the waiting arms
of Lestrade and his men Holmes leaps out of the cab
runs for them

Holmes pushes through to get to Watson
Police STRETCHER BEARERS arrive

Clothes burned hair singed skin dark with soot or
bloody with lacerations and punctures Watson looks done
for but he groans when the stretcher bearers roll him
roughly onto the stretcher

The stretcher bearers move Watson down the wharf towards
a waiting carriage Holmes moves with them down the
wharf

They reach the waiting carriage They load Watson
Holmes is about to climb on when Lestrade stops him
LESTRADE
You’re needed here

(to the driver)
Get him to hospital

The carriage takes off with the stretcher bearers
holding Watson down Holmes watches them go His face
is wracked with emotion

LESTRADE (CONT’D)
(losing it a little)
I watched him die They cut off
his head How is this possible

Holmes turns looks at Lestrade His arrogance and
jaunty self-confidence have been blasted away and
replaced with guilt and anguish -- because he knows he
manipulated Watson into being there

HOLMES
I don’t know

Lestrade looks genuinely terrified

LESTRADE

My men have been interrogating the
guests They all say the same
thing -- Blackwood plans to kill
the Queen and her entire
government using his magic and
there’s nothing we can do to stop
him

(beat)
Does he have the power to do that
Do you think it’s possible

HOLMES
I don’t know

LESTRADE
Well weve got until noon to stop
him Or God help us

CUT TO

INT CHEMICAL WORKS - VARIOUS - NIGHT

Holmes strides into the NOW-DESERTED WAREHOUSE past one
of the VATS OF CEREMONIAL WINE and towards THE BODY OF

THE WOMAN Blackwood killed

Light is low The woman’s body is just a shadow to us

But not to Holmes He looks down at her lost

He’s vulnerable and human in a way we’ve never seen
before

A CLINK OF GLASS AGAINST GLASS jerks his head around

Faint light and the shadow of movement comes from under a
door

Holmes pulls his gun stalks towards it
At the door he pauses Hears another clink of glass --

-- rips open the door ready to fire

INT LAB ROOM - NIGHT

Irene puts down a THICK-WALLED GLASS SPHERE about the
size of a cannon ball

IRENE
Hello Sherlock

Holmes is astounded Light from Irene’s KEROSENE LAMP
shows a shelf of glass spheres

They look at the glass spheres clear and beautiful in
the abstract obscure but disturbing as to their purpose

Beyond her a shattered wall gives us A GLIMPSE OF THE
HORSE TANK

IRENE (CONT’D)
I’m sorry about Watson I hope he
pulls through

Holmes can’t bear to talk about Watson

HOLMES
What are you here for What do
you want with Blackwood

IRENE
Now Sherlock --

HOLMES
(harsh rough)
No more games If you know
anything that would help stop him
this is the time to say so

Holmes is ragged with emotion His eyes are dangerous
They pierce Irene She nods

IRENE
Blackwood’s family has
manufactured weapons for
generations The kind of weapons
that build Empires that kill and
maim on a grand scale

(MORE)

IRENE (CONTD)
There’ve been rumors in Europe of
something new from Blackwood
Unconventional Powerful
(beat)
Magical

She gestures at the HORSE TANK The horses the glass
tubes the metal curlicues of the distillation equipment
the clear powder It’s a vision from Hell Its very
existence makes Blackwood’s power seem more real

IRENE (CONTD)
It appears the rumors were true

Irene moves towards the door

IRENE (CONTD)
Now if you don’t mind --

Holmes gives her space They are face to face in the
doorway Lots of complicated impossible stuff in the
air between all of it overshadowed by Blackwood

HOLMES
Where are you going

IRENE
I don’t want to be here at noon
Nor should you Come with me
(beat)
Or are you the kind of Englishman
who has to go down with his ship

One look into Holmes’ eyes and Irene knows the answer

IRENE (CONT’D)
Good luck then

HOLMES
Stay
IRENE
Stay
HOLMES
I --
(beat)
I find I work better with a
partner

A moment of consideration then a tiny regretful shake
of her head

IRENE
You need a partner you can trust
We’d betray each other for all
the right reasons
Irene reaches up kisses him He is a statue

IRENE
I’ll see you again I hope

Irene leaves as tough as she is beautiful

Holmes watches her go something like despair in his
eyes

EXT LONDON - VARIOUS - DAWN

Holmes hurries through the streets of his beloved city as
it comes awake He has changed out of evening wear
Unsuspecting Londoners launch themselves at yet another
day full of hope and energy

Holmes is agonizingly aware that unless Blackwood can be
stopped these people will live and die in terror

INT HOSPITAL - DAY

Holmes strides down the corridor slows and lets his
footsteps soften as he approaches Watson’s room

Holmes peeks in through the door --

-- and sees Mary sitting on a chair next to Watson’s bed
Watson is asleep or unconscious She holds his hand

Her eyes are closed She is there for the duration
willing him better

INT WATSON’S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Holmes looks on for a long moment The sight pierces
him He knows he is seeing something precious that he
nearly destroyed

Mary senses him but as she looks up --

-- Holmes ducks back out of sight

Then we hear the SOUND OF HIS FOOTSTEPS RETREATING down
the corridor

Mary gets to her feet moves quickly to the door

MARY
Sherlock

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

Holmes stops face anguished He’d rather face Dredger
than Mary

Mary catches up to him and he turns to face her

HOLMES

And that’s all he can manage

Mary reaches out takes one of Holmes’ hands in both of
hers looks him in the eye

MARY
Sherlock there’s something I want
you to know

(beat)
I want to marry him not diminish
him

(beat)

He has a generous heart There’s

room in it for both of us But

not if Blackwood has his way
(beat)

Do you understand

Holmes nods yes Mary releases Holmes’ hand

MARY (CONTD)
Stop him Nothing else matters

Strong words Mary turns marches back to Watson
Holmes watches her go and is puzzled by a strange new
feeling -- admiration for an ordinary woman

Holmes approaching through the hubbub

LESTRADE (CONTD)

at a wall clock -- 8 AM He takes Holmes over to the big
wall map

We know he hasn’t passed our dock
at Limehouse Reach to the east

sees the knife coming at him and closes the door --

Thunk

-- just in time The door stays closed Holmes
retrieves the knife walks back for another throw

IMAGES FLASHES

- the woman killed by Blackwood’s touch
- the black horses

- the glass spheres

A LOUD KNOCK at the door rips Holmes out of his thought
process

Irritated Holmes strides across the room jerks open the
door --

HOLMES
Lestrade How am I supposed to --

-- and sees WATSON STANDING THERE battered bandaged
barely upright Just getting there has taken an enormous
effort

Watson grins through the pain holds HOLMES’ VIOLIN

WATSON
You’1l1 need this

They don’t say anything They don’t need to
Holmes takes his violin
Watson leaves closes the door

Holmes scrapes the bow across the strings

INT SCOTLAND YARD - DAY

OVER we hear the SOUND OF THE VIOLIN BEING TUNED
Lestrade glares at Watson

Suddenly a STARTLINGLY HORRIBLE CASCADE OF VIOLIN SOUND
pours out from Lestrade’s office bringing the whole
situation room to a halt

Watson grins pulls TWO WADS OF COTTON WOOL from his
pocket stuffs them in his ears as the VIOLIN IS PUSHED
BEYOND ITS LIMITS

The violin is absolute torture for everyone but Watson

A POLICE RUNNER BURSTS IN spent staggers as fast as he
can across to Lestrade

ON HOLMES as he blinks begins to come out of his trance
a little notes repeating on the violin

THE BOW STOPS Silence

INT SCOTLAND YARD - DAY

Scotland Yard is almost deserted Watson stands
painfully in anticipation Takes the cotton out of his
ears

Lestrade’s door opens Holmes emerges drenched in
sweat eyes wide with neural overload

HOLMES
If every place a boat could be
moored has been searched by
Lestrade -- then the boat is
somewhere it could not be moored

Watson smiles He knows the signs Holmes is firing on
all cylinders again

HOLMES (CONTD)
What place on the river that is
not a mooring does Blackwood have
access to Special access

Watson thinks then --

WATSON
Oh Tower Bridge

Holmes grins

WATSON (CONTD)
The bridge footings are huge
Easily big enough for a concealed
dock

HOLMES
And Blackwood’s engineers helped
with the design

Holmes pauses looks around finally in the present

HOLMES (CONT’D)
Where is everyone

CUT TO

EXT POLICE DOCKS - DAY

A FLOTILLA OF POLICE LAUNCHES can just be seen taking the
bend at Waterloo Bridge heading upstream at full speed

CUT TO

A small fast POLICE LAUNCH waits for Holmes and Watson
as they stride fast down the dock

Holmes leads Watson onto the launch past a YOUNG
POLICEMEN who tends the gangway

EXT POLICE LAUNCH - DAY

As Holmes and Watson board (the latter with a visible
wince) the young policeman uncleats the bow line

LAUNCH CAPTAIN
We’ll need to hurry to catch
Inspector Lestrade

HOLMES
No we won’t We’re heading in
the other direction

LAUNCH CAPTAIN
But Detective --

Holmes shoves the launch away from the dock

HOLMES
(looking up at the
sun)
As fast as you can please

The young policeman hops on board with the lines as the
launch captain ramps up the engine

Holmes and Watson head for the bow It is a relief to
both of them to have a clear direction A solution

They allow themselves to drink in the magnificent view of
London for a moment

The young policeman coils the bow line just behind them

Then back to business

HOLMES
Irene said Blackwood had a magical
new weapon Is it possible it’s
some kind of poison

WATSON
You mean the way he killed that
woman
(with a shudder)
I’ve never seen anything that fast-
acting or vicious

HOLMES
And if instead of one person you
wanted to kill many

Watson looks at Holmes with growing horror

WATSON
Somehow put it in the water Or
the air

HOLMES

So you see Irene --—

Holmes lunges backwards fast as a snake hooks the young
policeman by the collar yanks him towards them --

-- and blocks a punch he knew was coming The young
policeman’s hat falls off to REVEAL IRENE IN DISGUISE

HOLMES (CONT’D)
-- it’s science not magic

Irene pulls herself free looks at Holmes coolly

IRENE
How does science explain the fact
that we saw Blackwood die a couple
of days ago and yet now he’s more
alive than ever

Irene and Watson look at Holmes for an answer He
doesn’t have one

HOLMES
Your employer must be paying you a
lot of money to find out

IRENE
I’m insulted I came to help you

WATSON
In disguise

IRENE
Does it matter We all want the
same thing

HOLMES
Is that so

IRENE
Yes to stop Blackwood
(at Holmes)
You said you needed a partner
Sherlock

A look passes between Watson and Holmes Did he really
say that

WATSON
She’s too dangerous

Holmes beckons the launch Captain

HOLMES
Handcuffs

The Captain approaches hands Holmes some cuffs

IRENE
You don’t need those --

Irene reaches out pats Watson lightly on the side --

IRENE (CONT’D)
-- you need me

-- which just about doubles Watson over with pain from
his broken ribs Point made by Irene

IRENE (CONT’D)
Use me I’m very good at what I
do

ON HOLMES decision time

WATSON
She tried to shoot you yesterday
IRENE
And helped save your life today
Holmes looks at the cuffs -- then puts them in his
pocket
WATSON

This is crazy You cannot trust
her

Holmes looks Irene in the eye with harsh amusement

HOLMES
Oh I don’t --

Holmes points at the high sun

HOLMES (CONT’D)
-- but sometimes you work with
what’s available

Irene smiles back dangerously

IRENE
Don’t worry Doctor -- it’ll only
be temporary

EXT TOWER BRIDGE - DAY

Establishing Tower Bridge is a COMBINATION SUSPENSION
AND LEAF BRIDGE one of the marvels of Victorian
engineering

TWO MASSIVE STEEL SKELETONS face each other across the
Thames poised on top of huge CONCRETE PILINGS These
are the bridge uprights or STANCHIONS

A CONSTRUCTION CRANE perches on top of each stanchion
and reaches out across the river

The stanchions are in the process of being linked across
the top by a HORIZONTAL NETWORK OF STEEL GIRDERS
starting from either side of the river At present the
GIRDERS ONLY REACH PARTWAY across the Thames

The GAP BETWEEN THEM is SPANNED BY a seemingly chaotic
tangle of ropes and RICKETY SCAFFOLDING supported by the
CONSTRUCTION CRANES FROM EITHER SIDE Beneath them --

-- the middle section has TWO HUGE LEAVES that can be
lifted with hydraulic pumps and MASSIVE COUNTERWEIGHTS
inside the stanchions to allow shipping to pass through

Right now the LEAVES ARE IN THE UP POSITION almost
perpendicular to the Thames

Right BENEATH THE TOWER-SIDE LEAF WE FIND THE POLICE
LAUNCH nosed up against the piling

HOLMES IS IN THE BOW banging on the concrete with a BOAT
HOOK He hasn’t found anything

HOLMES
It must be in the other one

The launch takes off across the river

EXT POLICE LAUNCH - DAY
Holmes hammers ON THE OTHER PILING faster and faster
trying without success to find anything other than solid
concrete
Desperation time
LAUNCH CAPTAIN
That’s it sir Twice around both
sides
Holmes lowers the boat hook
HOLMES
He can’t have vanished into thin

air It’s not possible

Irene shakes her head -- so much for Holmes’s idea --
LOOKS UP AT THE BRIDGE SPECULATIVELY

WATSON
The Queen opens parliament in half
an hour

Holmes nods lowers his head the very picture of defeat

CUT TO

EXT BLACKWOOD’S LAUNCH - DAY

We find Lestrade in a similar defeated pose on board
Blackwood’s red and black launch --

-- where two of Blackwood’s bowler-hatted Followers are
under arrest But no Blackwood

Lestrade smells something pungent sticks out his finger
touches it to the side of the cabin Wet paint This
whole chase was a decoy -- and it worked Half of
Scotland Yard are on launches surrounding the decoy

Lestrade pulls his watch looks at it looks up at the
sun as if trying to will time to stand still

CUT TO

EXT HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY

Flanked by her mounted guards THE QUEEN’S COACH
approaches the Houses of Parliament Magnificent and
completely vulnerable

CUT TO

EXT POLICE LAUNCH - DAY

Sun high over the Thames Clouds moving in wind picking
up weather turning English fast

Holmes hasn’t moved If anything his head is even
lower his eyes on the water lapping against the side of
the launch

LAUNCH CAPTAIN
I’1l take us back to Scotland
Yard

Holmes doesn’t reply Watson nods

The captain gooses the engine throws them into a turn
and accelerates

As they pick up speed the launch rises out of the water
revealing the vertical measuring lines on the hull below
the plimsol line (Lines which help gauge how heavily
loaded the vessel is)

ON HOLMES as he really focusses on the revealed lines on
the hull and a brain-based electrical charge
energizes him

HOLMES
Wait

Holmes raises his head looks across the water --
-- turns to the launch Captain points

HOLMES
Take us there

He’s pointing at the TOWER OF LONDON

HOLMES (CONT’D)
Now

The Launch Captain red-lines the engine Holmes whirls
towards Watson and Irene

HOLMES (CONT’D)
Over twenty feet of tide at this
time of year

They’re right under the TOWER EMBANKMENT

HOLMES (CONT’D)
Hide tide now but not this early
this morning

Watson and Irene don’t get it

HOLMES (CONTD)
(to captain)
Stop the boat

As the engine howls into reverse and the launch settles
hard

HOLMES (CONTD)
No better place to hide a boat
than somewhere with an entrance
that simply disappears

As the boat stops Watson and Irene see it --
-- the top of the arch of TRAITOR’S GATE just visible

above the rolling waterline the bulk of the opening
hidden under water

WATSON
Traitor’s Gate

HOLMES
Yes

IRENE

How appropriate

Watson looks at the water -- and sighs He knows exactly
what Holmes has in mind

CUT TO

EXT HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY

Big Ben shows that it is ten minutes to noon

INT HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY
A JEWEL-ENCRUSTED MACE KNOCKS THREE TIMES on a huge door

England is here in one place

Stealthy no splashes

Deep in the corner tight to the wall BLACKWOOD’S

Confirmation Brief satisfaction

Then they see the silhouettes of TWO BOWLER-HATTED
GUARDS upstairs and outside

EXT TOWER OF LONDON - DAY

The two guards don’t stand a chance Holmes takes out
one Irene the other

Watson joins them He’s having trouble keeping up

Holmes sees something that makes him smile grimly

EXT TOWER GREEN - DAY

Blackwood’s Followers have their foreheads pressed to the
grass

Dredger watches them a hyper-alert slab of malevolence
Around the perimeter several BOWLER-HATTED THUGS stand
guard

Blackwood kneels at the apex of the arc lips moving
soundlessly as he summons the Dark One

Something moans in the air Wind Or not
Blackwood’s eyes shoot open his head snaps up and he

rises to his feet as if some unseen power pulled him
upright

Blackwood glitters with cruel power and triumph He is
terrifying

BLACKWOOD
The Duke of Devon stand

A FEEBLE MINOR ROYAL staggers to his feet shaking with
fear

Blackwood surges towards him stops fixes him with his
reptilian eyes and places his right hand on his cheek

The Duke of Devon almost faints

BLACKWOOD (CONTD)
You will give the new Empire a
royal face
(beat)
Lord Cholmondely stand

An AUGUST NOBLE stands terrified Blackwood caresses
his cheek

BLACKWOOD (CONT’D)
You will be Prime Minister

The rest of you will be named to
my Cabinet as needed

BACK TO

And I What will I be What does
the Dark One want of me King
Emperor No nothing so grand
I’m to be what I was born for no
more and no less

(beat)
In our new Empire I am the
Minister of War

Blackwood stops dead
BLACKWOOD (CONT’D)
My first act is a necessary one
for without death there can be no
rebirth

Blackwood turns slowly

BLACKWOOD (CONTD)
Let us now open the Gates of Hell
and begin our new world with
the death of the old

Blackwood faces the White Tower eyes tilting up towards
the top floor

SMASH CUT TO
Holmes and Watson share an urgent look
BACK TO

Blackwood raises his hands and begins a chant in an
ancient language

The Followers look on in increasing terror
Dredger’s eyes dance with anticipation

CUT TO
Keeping cover between them and Blackwood Holmes Watson
and Irene make for the White Tower
INT WHITE TOWER - DAY
The White Tower is a square tower four stories high
TWO STAIRCASES in opposite corners lead to the top floor
one is made of STONE one is made of WOOD

Neither staircase can be seen from the other

TWO BOWLER-HATTED THUGS GUARD THE WOODEN STAIR CASE --

-- HOLMES AND WATSON drop them from behind

THEY HEAD UPSTAIRS FAST

Or in Watson’s case not so fast He falls behind

When Irene turns to look back he waves her on pauses to

rest

Which is when A BOWLER-HATTED THUG JUMPS HIM FROM BEHIND

This isn’t a fight Watson is no match He quickly
finds himself staring down the barrel of a gun about to
die --

-- but the THUG JERKS GASPS sinks to the ground with
IRENE’S WICKED LITTLE KNIFE sticking out of his back

Irene swarms back down the stairs retrieves her knife
and gives Watson a saucy shrug aren’t you glad I’m here
now

Watson acknowledges her point stepping over the dead
Follower --

-- which DISLODGES HIS BOWLER HAT and sends it rolling
down the stairs

CUT TO

EXT TOWER GREEN - DAY

Sun minutes from noon Blackwood’s countdown increases
in intensity Dredger looks around sees movement as --

-- THE BOWLER HAT TUMBLES OUT OF THE DOOR AT THE BASE OF
THE WHITE TOWER

Dredger frowns -- then heads for the White Tower fast

CUT TO

INT WHITE TOWER - DAY

AT THE TOP FLOOR OF WHITE TOWER Holmes Irene and Watson
look at --

BARREL AFTER BARREL OF EXPLOSIVE clustered together in a
circle each labelled

BLACKWOOD MUNITIONS
HIGH EXPLOSIVE
BY ORDER OF THE QUEEN

Enough explosive to vaporize the top of White Tower

There’s a THICK GLASS CYLINDER about a two feet in
diameter and four feet long base wedged into the center
of the barrels It is sealed with a STAINLESS STEEL LID
LOCKED to the glass

They move closer Light from a nearby window illuminates
the glass cylinder so that the contents can be seen
clearly

At the top of the glass cylinder cogs springs
flywheels all in motion Whirring movement ominous
ticking A CLOCK-FACE WITH A RED SWEEP reads THREE
MINUTES TO NOON

Beneath the applied watchmaking half of the cylinder is
packed with a soft grey ugly paste Cordite detonator

Below the cordite is THICK GLASS SPHERE like those we
saw at Blackwood’s factory It is full of THE CLEAR
POWDER FROM THE HORSE TANK

HOLMES
Blackwood’s weapon

WATSON
It was incubated in the bodies of
the horses It’s biological

They’re beginning to understand the horror of what
they’re looking at

IRENE
How does it work

WATSON
The blast will spread the
particles into the atmosphere for
miles around Anyone breathing
them in will end up like the woman
at the factory

IRENE
Everyone in the Parliament
building --
WATSON
(grim)

And everyone else within the
radius of the blast

Their faces show how staggered they are

WATSON (CONTD)
Thousands of innocent people

Two and half minutes

THE SOUND OF HEAVY FOOTSTEPS clatters up towards them UP
BOTH STAIRWAYS

HOLMES
(to Irene)
Can you pick the lock

In response Irene reaches up to her hair pulls out TWO
LONG THIN HAIR PINS and starts to climb ONTO THE BARRELS
OF HIGH EXPLOSIVE Watson grabs her arm
94

WATSON
Wait See those two springs
That’s a motion sensor Any sharp
movement

IRENE nods takes a deep breath slides onto the barrels
of explosive and steps gingerly towards the glass sphere
A gut-clenching perch

HOLMES LOCKS THE THICK DOOR at the top of the wooden
stairs

The stone stairs have no door Holmes joins Watson
They pull their revolvers take shelter on either side of
the doorway

WATSON (CONTD)
I’ve only got six shots

HOLMES
(with a grin)
Then we’re in trouble if there are
more than twelve
THE FIRST OF THE BOWLER-HATTED THUGS CHARGE up at them
Holmes and Watson fire down with disciplined shots

FOLLOW THE FIRST SHOT THUG AS HE TUMBLES DOWNSTAIRS --

-- to find AT LEAST TWENTY MORE waiting to take his
place with Dredger commanding them

DREDGER
Keep going

DREDGER RUNS for the wooden stairs bounds up them until
he reaches the locked door

He raises his huge foot kicks at the door No go
It’ll take a siege engine

He pivots kicks out the window squeezes himself out of
it and swings sideways

CUT TO

Irene leans right over the glass cylinder and starts to
pick the lock

CUT TO

A brief pause as the thugs pull the dead and wounded out
of the way

HOLMES
How many shots left

WATSON
Three

Both men look around the top floor Nothing but a couple
of SUITS OF ARMOR and a SMALL CEREMONIAL CANNON on
wheels that hasn’t been fired in at least a century

HOLMES
Irene
Last sun streaming in helps Irene works her hair pins
deftly Click
IRENE

Got it
Then the sunlight is eclipsed --

-- by Dredger’s body as he CRASHES IN THROUGH THE
WINDOW rolls to his feet opens his RAZOR and HEADS
STRAIGHT FOR IRENE

Holmes tosses his gun to Watson launches himself across
the room at Dredger --

HOLMES
(to Irene
Don’t stop

-- and hits the huge Cockney with the THREE-PUNCH
SEQUENCE THAT DROPPED MCMURDO in his tracks earlier

DREDGER GRINS LUNGES AT HOLMES with the razor Holmes
dances back out of reach

THE CHARGE FROM BELOW RESUMES Watson fires both guns
husbanding his bullets

IRENE OPENS THE STAINLESS STEEL LID and stares in ata
maze of cogs springs and flywheels -- which keep
ticking

A RED SWEEP ON THE TIMER GIVES THEM ABOUT A MINUTE

Holmes vs Dredger This is a brutal visceral fight
Dredger is stronger Holmes is more skilled Dredger has
his beloved razor Every time we look at Holmes he has
another ruby stripe from a near-miss After Holmes ducks
under a razor-slash and thuds a side-kick against
Dredger’s ribs

HOLMES (CONT’D)

(panting)
Irene
Irene doesn’t answer -- she has most of the timer out of
the cylinder and sees that ANY FURTHER MOVEMENT WILL

TRIGGER THE DETONATOR

Then CLICK CLICK Both of Watson’s guns are empty
FOOTSTEPS KEEP COMING Grunting with pain Watson picks
up the NEAREST SUIT OF ARMOR HURLS IT down the stairs
buys a little time

A STEEL GAUNTLET falls off the armor in passing Holmes
scoops it up and --

CLANG

-- uses the armor to KNOCK THE RAZOR OUT of Dredger’s
hand

Dredger grabs Holmes and hurls him through the air
HOLMES HAMMERS INTO THE BARRELS OF EXPLOSIVE shifting
them -- and the glass cylinder

IRENE
Please don’t do that

Dredger rushes Holmes Holmes dives at his feet
tripping him DREDGER HAMMERS INTO THE EXPLOSIVES --

-- nearly knocking Irene over

But also dislodging the glass cylinder

Irene braces for the explosion -- heaves a huge sigh of
relief when it doesn’t come

She starts to gently coax the timer and cordite out of
the cylinder Delicacy amidst mayhem

Watson tosses the LAST SUIT OF ARMOR DOWN the stairs
HOLMES AND DREDGER GRAPPLE AND ROLL on the floor

Dredger gets on top of Holmes hammers him with
thunderous blows -- once twice bouncing Holmes’ head
off the stone floor viciously -- but not a third time as

Holmes times it twists sends Dredger over sideways --

CLOSE UP onto his own razor with all his weight

DREDGER HOWLS thrusts himself up to his feet looks down
at the RAZOR THRUST TO THE HILT into his gut

He reaches down pulls it out stands gushing blood
takes one step towards Holmes drops to his knees drops
the razor looks at Holmes with shock and outrage --

-- and dies

In the distance the BELLS OF ST PAUL’S CATHEDRAL BEGIN
TO CHIME NOON

BONG One
WATSON
(in pain)

I need help

WATSON PUSHES THE CEREMONIAL CANNON across the room
towards the stairs --

-- where MORE THUGS are almost at the top of the stairs

BONG Eight
-- then at the WINDOW Dredger burst in through

No communication necessary They lunge for the
detonator scoop it up and run for the broken window on --

frees the leaf HAMMERS THE LOCK off it with one decisive
blow PUSHES THE LEVER all the way over --

CUT TO

EXT TOP OF TOWER BRIDGE - DAY

As the counterweight comes to a stop at the top HOLMES
pulls himself into the steelwork and climbs onto the TOP
OF THE STANCHION

The light is sultry Wind gusts strong Weather coming
in

The top of the stanchion is not a solid surface Massive
steel girders are crisscrossed with planks and ladders
Even though roped down planks shudder in the wind
Precarious exposed terrain

Further out precarious becomes out-and-out dangerous
Nothing but A HUNDRED FEET OF TEMPORARY SCAFFOLDING --
PLANKS ACROSS THICK ROPE -- spans the gap between the
steel SUPPORTED from either end by the CRANES

Which is where Holmes sees a FAMILIAR FIGURE SILHOUETTED
at the swaying shuddering middle of the bridge

Irene
Angry Holmes leaps along planks and girders towards her

And then Holmes freezes at the edge of the temporary
scaffolding

Because the shape of the silhouette has changed grown --
-- to reveal that BLACKWOOD HAS IRENE

He holds her from behind his gun to her head Blood
trickles from a gash in her forehead She looks dazed

concussed almost unable to take her own weight

BLACKWOOD’S WEAPON GLEAMS precariously at their feet ina
nest of coiled rope

This is an insane place to be but Blackwood doesn’t seem
to notice All he wants is revenge no matter what it
costs him

BLACKWOOD
You’re just in time detective

Irene starts to sag Blackwood twists her arm up her
back and she gasps in pain stands up

BLACKWOOD (CONT’D)
We can share her agony

Blackwood cocks the gun

BLACKWOOD (CONT’D)
Ready

HOLMES
Go ahead You’1ll still be nothing
more than a cheap faker with a
second-rate magic act I know how
you did it

Blackwood hesitates

As he talks HOLMES INCHES CLOSER and closer along the
temporary scaffolding BALANCE IS AN ISSUE for all of
them especially when the wind gusts

HOLMES (CONTD)
It was all trickery The gunshot
the executioner’s mask
everything You never died
(beat)
And you’ve got no more magic in
your touch than I have

Blackwood smirks

BLACKWOOD
You’re a blind man stumbling
through the darkness of your own
fear
(beat)
You can see Him too Just open
your eyes

HOLMES

My eyes are open Blackwood And
I see a fraud The woman in the
factory -- you had a syringe full
of your weapon hidden in your
hand You injected her

(mocking)
Youre a fraud

BLACKWOOD
Am I

Blackwood transfers his gun to his left hand the gun
barrel never leaving Irene’s head his eyes never leaving
Holmes

He opens his right hand shows it like a magician

BLACKWOOD (CONTD)
No syringe

Alarm in Holmes’ eyes as Blackwood’s CARESSES Irene’s
face RUBY RING SPARKLING

BLACKWOOD (CONT’D)
See my touch for yourself

IRENE gasps her knees buckle she COLLAPSES --

-- and BLACKWOOD KICKS HER OVER THE EDGE almost
dismissively

BLACKWOOD (CONTD)
She’s nothing

Timing the movement of the scaffolding Holmes leaps at
Blackwood

BLACKWOOD gets the gun up FIRES but its in the wrong
hand and the scaffolding shifts under them --

-- and the SHOT GRAZES HOLMES SIDE knocks him sprawling
onto the planking

He has to grab on desperately to stop himself from
following Irene

As he does BLACKWOOD SLAMS DOWN ONTO HIM knees-first
thudding any remaining breath out of him

Winded bleeding shot HOLMES IS AT BLACKWOOD’S MERCY

Blackwood straddles him Pushes Holmes’ head down
against the planking with the barrel of his gun

BLACKWOOD
It’s just you and me As it
should be With the death you
deserve

BLACKWOOD LIFTS HIS RIGHT HAND flexes the finger with
the ruby ring and --

CUT TO

EXTRA CLOSE UP a short HOLLOW NEEDLE DARTS out of the
ring

CUT TO

BLACKWOOD reaches down and PUTS HIS RIGHT HAND on Holmes’
battered cheek

Holmes tries to buck Blackwood off

Blackwood gun-whips him subdues him puts the gun back
against his temple

BLACKWOOD
He’s looking forward to meeting
you He told me so himself

Blackwood caresses Holmes’ cheek

BLACKWOOD (CONT’D)
Feel my touch

Holmes’ eyes flare in pain He spasms under Blackwood
Incredibly fast his eyes roll back and stare sightlessly
at the darkening sky

Holmes is dead

Blackwood exhales shakily An intense but satisfying
moment

He puts his gun away turns his head to locate his weapon
in its nest of rope --

-- POW --
Gets Holmes’ hard fist across his chin

Holmes grabs Blackwood’s head jerks his face down to
meet Holmes’ forehead whipping up

-- CRUNCH --

Blackwood reels back keening through his pulverized
nose He looks at his ring in bloody disbelief

BLACKWOOD
Not possible

Not possible to poison London
without killing yourself and your
followers -- unless you had an
antidote

sacrament with everyone else

ON BLACKWOOD as the lightning of defeat flashes in his
eyes

All I had to do was trick you into
using your ring instead of your
gun
Blackwood snatches for his gun --

-- but Holmes gets to it first They both have their
hands on the gun when --

-- BAM--
-- HOLMES SHOOTS BLACKWOOD point-blank through the chest
blowing him backwards onto the swaying planking the
force taking the gun with him
Holmes rolls over to fight his way to his feet when --
IRENE
(from below)
Sherlock

Still on hands and knees Holmes looks over the edge

HOLMES’ POV IRENE SWINGS twenty feet below at the end of
a scaffolding rope

IRENE (CONTD)
I’m not going to able to hang on
for much longer
Biting down on the pain HOLMES reaches down HAULS IRENE
UP He’s out of gas by the time she gets to the
underside of the scaffolding She reaches out to him

Their hands join

Holmes swings Irene onto the scaffolding She tumbles
onto him

They lie there faces close together gasping for breath

IRENE
Thank you

Click

Irene looks down to see that HOLMES HAS HANDCUFFED HER to
him

HOLMES
You’re not running away this time

Before Irene can reply A SHOT RINGS OUT and the entire
SCAFFOLDING JERKS HARD

They look up

A WIDE TRAIL OF BLOOD leads along the scaffolding to
Blackwood

He lies on his back His GLASS SPHERE is cradled under
one arm The other is raised holding the gun He
shoots at the sky Insane

BAM

AGAIN and worse this time the SCAFFOLD JERKS

Which is when they realize that Blackwood isn’t shooting
at the sky -- he’s shooting at the TOOTHED BRAKE ON THE
CRANE BLOCK through which runs the cable that holds up
one end of the scaffolding

BAM

The CRANE BLOCK IS HIT AGAIN the brake loses another
tooth The steel CABLE BEGINS TO SLIP unreeling slowly
The Tower side of the SCAFFOLDING BEGINS TO TILT

downwards

Blackwood’s on the scaffold This means his death too
He doesn’t care He raises the gun to shoot again

HOLMES
Run

Holmes jerks Irene to her feet and THEY RUN along the
scaffold towards the other side of the bridge (Running
“uphill”)

BAM One last shot and the CRANE BLOCK CRUMBLES

The CABLE SCREAMS OUT

ONE SIDE OF THE SCAFFOLDING PLUMMETS DOWNWARDS --

-- JERKING THE OTHER SIDE LOOSE from the bridge steel

An EVER-WIDENING GAP between Holmes and Irene and safety

Sprinting balancing Holmes and Irene share a quick
glance a nod --

-- and GO FOR IT

As the entire scaffolding swings down over the Thames
THEY LEAP THE GAP

fly through the air handcuffed together
LAND ON SOLID STEEL with a very welcome thud

CUT TO
As it swings down the SCAFFOLDING FLIPS over

BLACKWOOD’S WEAPON DROPS out of his arm falls towards
the lowered leaf of the Bridge below

Blackwood reaches for it --

-- and JERKS TO A STOP choked by the ROPE TANGLED AROUND
HIS NECK

CUT TO
FOLLOW THE WEAPON down down
- down to lethal impact on the bridge leaf

- which it just misses plunging instead into the
Thames with a neat splash

CUT TO

EXT THE THAMES RIVER - DAY

After a long moment the GLASS SPHERE BOBS UP and begins
floating towards the sea

CUT TO

EXT TOWER BRIDGE - DAY

An ARMY OF BOBBIES scales the stanchion across the river
from the Tower of London

CUT TO

EXT TOP OF TOWER BRIDGE - DAY

ON THE TOP Holmes and Irene only manage to stay upright
by leaning against each other It looks quite romantic
with London spread out beneath them

HOLMES
Beautiful day

IRENE
In a beautiful city

Homes nods dreamily

IRENE (CONT’D)
Sherlock let me go

They’re STILL HANDCUFFED TOGETHER Holmes looks at the
cuffs for a moment then at Irene

HOLMES
Who are you working for

IRENE
He’s called the Professor That’s
all I know -- except that he pays
well

CUT TO

EXT THE THAMES RIVER - DAY

The GLASS SPHERE drifts down river glinting in the
sunlight Beyond it we see the bow wave of an
APPROACHING LAUNCH

EXT LAUNCH - DAY

On the prow of the launch stands a man dressed in black
with cane and top hat (MORIARTY )

MORIARTY
Close as you can

HELMSMAN
Yes Professor

They close in on the glass sphere --

-- but are CUT OFF BY A SPEEDING POLICE LAUNCH

EXT POLICE LAUNCH - DAY

Lestrade looks on as WATSON LEANS OVER WITH A DIP NET --
scoops up the sphere (with a wince) brings it on board

They examine it The SURFACE IS FILIGREED WITH CRACKS
some quite alarming --

-- but the clear powder is still safely inside

Watson and Lestrade share a look of relief -- that was
close

CUT TO

EXT LAUNCH - DAY
Disgusted Moriarty turns away from the railing
MORIARTY
(to helmsman)
Take us away

The launch turns hard and heads down river

CUT TO

EXT TOP OF TOWER BRIDGE - DAY
Irene rattles the cuffs

IRENE (CONT’D)
Sherlock I saved your life

HOLMES
Id say we’re more than even on
that score

Holmes looks over Irene’s shoulder

BOBBIES swarm onto the top of the stanchion lead by a
BEEFY SERGEANT

IRENE
Look into your heart Is this
really what you want

HOLMES
Probably not

Holmes finds the key UNLOCKS THE CUFF around his own
wrist Irene gives him a triumphant little smile
waiting for him to unlock her cuff

HOLMES (CONTD)
Look me up when you get out

He hands his cuff over to the beefy sergeant
HOLMES (CONTD)

Shes tricky treacherous and
dangerous Be careful
BEEFY SERGEANT
My middle name sir

Click The open cuff closes over the beefy sergeant’s
wrist

Irene gives Holmes a look that promises lots and lots of
future trouble

Holmes grins welcoming it --

HOLMES
Goodbye Irene

-- and turns his back to look out at London as Irene is
lead away

As he is bandaged by a POLICE MEDIC Holmes drinks in the
city he just saved in all its glory

PULL BACK to show Holmes standing tall and proud in the
wind at the top of Tower Bridge --

-- as below BLACKWOOD SWINGS over the Thames at the end
of a tangle of rope dangling from the collapsed
scaffold

Hanged like a common man after all with Tower Bridge as
his gibbet

PULL BACK FROM THIS GRUESOME SIGHT --
-- PULL AWAY UP RIVER faster and faster until we --

-- ZERO IN ON THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT WHERE --

EXT HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY

-- THE QUEEN’S COACH AND ESCORT head safely away from
Parliament back to Buckingham Palace

Crisis over

FADE TO

EXT SCOTLAND YARD - END OF THE DAY

Gunshot wound bandaged cuts cleaned Holmes walks out
through Scotland Yard with Lestrade and Watson holding
his violin
LESTRADE
I still don’t understand how
Blackwood faked his own execution

HOLMES
I had trouble with that one
myself The two officials at his
execution were members of the
Order of the Golden Bough

IMAGE FLASHES -- the two POMPOUS-LOOKING OFFICIALS push
Blackwood’s head onto the block

HOLMES
- were part of his cult They
helped him change places

-- the first Official grabs the top of the EXECUTIONERS
SLEEVELESS MASKTUNIC --

HOLMES (VO) (CONTD)
- with the only man there
wearing a mask

-- BLACKWOODS RING scrapes the ankle of the EXECUTIONER
his legs buckling --

HOLMES (VO) (CONTD)
While we

-- A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT the sounds of panic --

HOLMES (VO) (CONTD)
- were looking somewhere else

-- Blackwood stands as the Executioner falls his head
rising smoothly into the suspended masktunic

Lestrade is still having trouble absorbing it

LESTRADE
I was looking straight at him

HOLMES
No you werent Instinct
Lestrade When a gun fires you
look to see where the danger is
And thats what everyone in the
crowd did Including me and
Watson

Lestrade shakes his head -- then sees something across
the room that brings him up short The BEEFY SERGEANT
approaches puce with shame
LESTRADE
What is it Sergeant

BEEFY SERGEANT
Begging your pardon Inspector --
it’s the woman

ON HOLMES AND WATSON as they exchange a wry and
unsurprised look

FADE TO

INT 221 BAKER STREET - EVENING

HOLMES
Have you got the ring

WATSON
Of course

Both men sport a COUPLE OF DAYS WORTH OF STUBBLE
Neither of them has been anywhere near a razor

HOLMES
Show me

Watson gives Holmes a sheepish look fumbles a small box
out of his pocket flips it open to reveal a ring with a
microscopic diamond

WATSON
It’s all I can afford until --

HOLMES
-- until your practice is up and
running May I

Holmes reaches for the ring Watson lets him take it out
of the box Then Holmes replaces it with another This
is a STUNNING RING WITH A HUGE FLAWLESS PINK DIAMOND

HOLMES

The King of Bohemia gave it to me
WATSON

I couldn’t possibly
HOLMES

Watson -- Ill never use it

Ever We both know that

Before Watson can argue any further there is a knock at
the door
HOLMES
Here she is
WATSON
(still on the ring)

Holmes --
Holmes closes the ring box emphatically

HOLMES
She deserves it
(leaving)
I’1ll let her in on my way out

Holmes opens the door Mary looking stunning holds a
green HARROD’S PACKET

MARY
(entering)
I have something for you
(at Holmes)
Both of you

Mary pulls two identical wrapped boxes from the Harrod’s
packet hands them to each man

WATSON
What is it

HOLMES
Wait I’11 tell you --

Holmes begins the process of deducing what’s in the box
Watson clears his throat Holmes looks up -- realizes
that this is not the time and place

So for once Holmes opens the box like a normal human
being -- and pulls out a small metal and ivory device

shaped something like a T Neither he nor Watson have
any idea what it is

MARY
It’s from America A new
invention
(beat)

It’s called a safety razor You
can shave without seeing a blade

Both men rub their itchy stubble

HOLMES
Thank you Mary
Holmes puts the razor aside He’ll use it if he feels
like it He shoots Watson a sly nod -- welcome to
domesticity
HOLMES (CONT’D)
Let me know how it feels The
safety razor that is

Holmes leaves The moment the door clicks closed Watson
and Mary look into each other’s eyes

WATSON
Mary

MARY
Yes
EXT 221 BAKER STREET - NIGHT
Holmes emerges from his home pauses at the bottom of the
steps Looks left looks right deciding which way to
go The night is alive London is alive

His London

Holmes turns right and strides off alone down Baker
Street in search of entertainment or trouble or both

FADE TO BLACK

THE END
