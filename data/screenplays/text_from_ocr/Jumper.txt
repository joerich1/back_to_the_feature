OVER BLACK

DAVID (V0)

My name is David Rice And this is
the story of how I became a hero
In order to make sense of it you
need to see all of it Even the
embarrassing parts

(beat)
Even the parts I wish I could take
back

FADE IN
EXT CYPRUS AIPORT - TARMAC DAY (VIDEO FOOTAGE)

A 767 sits on a runway surrounded by local Army and Police
vehicles the emergency chute extending from an open door

DAVID (V0)
My mother died when I was twelve
She was a flight attendant for
Trans-Global Airlines There was a
hijacking Maybe you remember it
Flight 932 out of Greece

We cut to a CLOSER VIEW RASHID MATAR (30s) stands in the
open doorway holding a gun to the head of the CAPTAIN He
is clean-shaven with dark bushy eyebrows and deep remote
eyes On the tarmac below an OFFICIAL pleads with him

DAVID (V0) (contd)
The lead hijacker was a man named
Rashid Matar While he was
negotiating he decided to let one
of the hostages go

ANOTHER VIEW closer still MARY NILES an attractive woman
in her late-30s wearing a rumpled stewardess uniform She
looks distressed as Matar handcuffs a briefcase to her wrist

DAVID (V0) (cont’d)
Matar said he wanted her to carry a
message Something in a briefcase --

Matar PUSHES Niles from the doorway She tumbles down the
emergency chute landing awkwardly A beat then she stands
shakily heading towards officials who move in to receive her

DAVID (V0) (contd)
When my mother was a hundred feet
from the plane Matar blew the
briefcase up

Our view ZOOMS IN again into a tight close-up of Niles the
image now granular and pixelated Suddenly it FREEZES

DAVID (V0) (cont’d)
I said I’d show you all of it but
you don’t need to see this part
Just know this behind every hero
there’s a tragedy And now you’ve
learned mine

SUPER TITLE OVER BLACK
“MY SECRET ORIGIN”
INT CLEARY HIGH-SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

AN IMAGE OF THE MOON The image changes to A CLOSER VIEW
MR BOWKER (50s) a rumpled but affable teacher mans a slide-
projector providing commentary for his STUDENTS

BOWKER
The lighter terrain called the
highlands is more heavily cratered
and older than the darker maria --
a latin word meaning seas

DAVID (V0)
The first time it happened was on my
seventeenth birthday

ANGLE ON DAVID RICE A loner Small in stature
possessing a distinct lack of self-confidence The kind of
kid who’s friends with the girl but never actually gets her
Case in point David is stealing glances at --

DAVID (V0) (cont’d)
April ninth the same day Hugh
Hefner was born the guy who owns
the Playboy Mansion

-- MILLIE HARRISON a fresh-faced beauty sitting near
the front Millie is the prototypical girl-next-door

DAVID (V0O (cont’d)
I wish I could say Hef and I have a
lot in common but the fact is we
don’t

MARK KOBOLD a smirking jock in a Huron River Rats
jersey mouths a silent kiss at David Other kids SNICKER

DAVID (VO) (contd)
That’s Mark Kobold my competition
Hes everything I’m not --

The BELL RINGS and the students rise Mark makes his way
over to Millie throwing his arm around her shoulder

DAVID (V0) (contd)
-- which is why he’s dating Millie
Harrison and I just help her study

BOWKER (0S)
David

Mr Bowker motions David over David watches Mark and Millie
kissing then turns to Mr Bowker who sips from a coffee mug
that reads “”AND THE GEEK SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH”

BOWKER (cont‘d)
Got another riddle for you You’re
in a room with three monkeys One
has a banana one has a stick one
has nothing Which primate in the
room is the smartest

DAVID
Me I’m a primate too

Mr Bowker gives a knowing nod towards Mark and Millie

BOWKER
We all are Never forget that

Don’t worry Youll get your day
in the sun

DAVID
You think

BOWKER
Guaranteed Now beat it before I
get anymore Obi-wan on you

INT CLEARY HIGH-SCHOOL - HALLWAYLOCKERS - DAY

David is at his locker distinctly not part of the social
fabric He sees Millie approaching She smiles at him

DAVID (V0O)
I‘d known Millie since grade
school And even though she’d gone
on to win the popularity lottery
she was still cool enough to give a
nobody like me the time of day

MILLIE
Seven more weeks David One more
set of finals then it’s over I
am so ready for that The moment
summer’s here I’m gone

DAVID (V0)
Millie was going to Europe after
graduation A bike trip The kind
of thing I never wouldve had the
money for Or the guts

DAVID (cont’d)
Speaking of summer --

David reaches into his pocket handing Millie a small box
She looks up at him curious

DAVID (cont’d)
Open it

Millie does pulling out a gold charm of the Eiffel Tower

DAVID (cont’d)
It’s for a charm bracelet I
figured you could start one You
can keep adding more -- all the
different places you’1l be seeing

Millie stares at David genuinely touched

MILLIE
You didn’t need to do this David

DAVID
I know your birthday’s coming up
And we‘re friends right So —--

David shrugs pleased by her response but still self-conscious

DAVID (cont’d)
The Eiffel Tower’s got one-thousand
six hundred and sixty-five steps
I looked it up

MILLIE
(playfully)
Like the proud bookworm you are
You keep your nose buried in those
pages you’ll end up falling down a
rabbit hole one day

DAVID
I like the rabbit hole It’s safe
in there

MARK (0S)

Head’s up Ricebowl1

WHAM David is side-swiped by Mark Kobold He falls against
the lockers dropping his backpack Beside Mark are two
other jocks BERKHOFFER and JEFFERSON

MARK (cont‘d)
Ooh fumble

Mark scoops up David’s backpack tosses it to Berkhoffer

MILLIE
Mark come on Leave him alone

David lunges for his backpack but Berkhoffer lifts it out of
reach tossing it back to Mark who LAUGHS --

MARK
Relax Millie Brain Boy could use
the workout

-- and runs down the hall David takes up pursuit
EXT CLEARY HIGH-SCHOOL —- DAY

Spring thaw has yet to come Mark and his cronies race down
the school steps WHOOPING They head across the snow-covered
commons making for the woods at the edge of the schoolyard

David follows but he’s not as fast as his tormentors They
pause toying with him allowing him to catch up Mark
extends the backpack towards an out-of-breath David --

MARK
Okay okay dont have a C-section
Rice We’re just having fun --

- but then he takes off again plunging into the woods

EXT WOODS - HURON RIVER - DAY

Mark breaks from the trees slipping down a hillside towards
the frozen Huron River He skids to a stop then flings the
backpack out onto the ice Shortly Mark is joined by his
boys Then David On the hill above Millie and a few OTHER
STUDENTS gather watching

David angrily pushes past Mark to the edge of the river

DAVID
Why do you have to be such an ass-
hole

MARK

I don’t know Maybe it’s genetic

David tests the ice with his foot It seems thick enough
Gingerly he starts towards the backpack one step at a time

MILLIE
David don’t -- it’s not safe

David looks back at her He’s already twenty feet out He
continues to his backpack picks it up Grins triumphantly --

DAVID
It’s fine see

--as the ice CAVES IN beneath him

EXT HURON RIVER - UNDERWATER - DAY

David panics trying to claw his way to the surface reaching
towards the light shining in through the break in the ice

EXT HURON RIVER —- DAY

Mark and his friends linger on the riverbank shocked But
Millie rushes forward down the hill onto the ice itself

MILLIE
Someone do something Get some
help

As we rise above her we glimpse of David beneath the
translucent ice below her feet She drops to her knees
David futilely beats against the underside of the ice trying
to free himself But the current is dragging David deeper
and further down-river Away from Millie

EXT HURON RIVER - UNDERWATER - DAY

We briefly see Millie through the ice her CRIES muffled as
David is being pulled downward

DAVID (VO)
I remember the sound A whining
noise like the world was turning
itself inside-out And then --

We hear Davids HEARTBEAT then the WHINING NOISE as it
overtakes everything else Darkness closes in

INT ANN ARBOR PUBLIC LIBRARY - STACKS — DAY

CLOSE ON David as he COUGHS up water The noise vanishes
David sits up finding himself on a carpeted floor

DAVID (V0O)
- everything was normal again

David is at the rear of the library stacks shivering a pool
of water beneath him Books are scattered around him having

been knocked from the shelves A BOY stands at the end of
the aisle clutching a Dr Seuss book staring open-mouthed

David picks up a book on the floor There’s a stamp inside
the cover “Property of Ann Arbor Public Library”

ANGLE ON A NEARBY POSTER

with a bespectacled badger amidst a pile of books It reads
“ESCAPE TO YOUR LIBRARY -- OPEN A WORLD OF WONDER”

DAVID (V0) (cont’d)
I couldn’t explain it I’d read
about people having seizures
losing time things like trauma-
induced amnesia --

INT ANN ARBOR PUBLIC LIBRARY - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY

David makes his way past the front desk drawing stares from
the STAFF His clothes are dripping and he’s leaving wet
footprints behind him his Nikes SQUISHING as he walks

DAVID (VO)
Maybe I had some kind of brain
tumor Maybe I was just going
insane Whatever had happened I
figured it couldn’t be good

EXT SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK
A swath of lower-income tract homes Streetlights flicker on
as the sun dies A half-dissolved snowman holds vigil A
BUS pulls to a stop at the end of the street David exits
clutching himself to fend off the chills making his way to --
AN UNASSUMING RANCH-STYLE HOUSE
Shabby and depressing A rusty PICKUP in the driveway

DAVID (VO)

To make matters worse my Dad was
home
INT DAVID‘S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
David ducks his head down as he crosses the living room

DAVID (V0)
He‘d never been the best of
fathers But after Mom died life
at home had gotten worse

WILLIAM RICE (40s) a brooding alpha-male gone to seed is
parked on the sofa He’s nursing a beer wears a work—-shirt
with the name “BILL” embroidered on it

WILLIAM
What the hell happened to you

DAVID
Just some stupid kids at school

WILLIAM
Jesus it’s always something with
you isn’t it
(gazing downward)
You’re tracking crap all over the
carpet

David ignores him Best to keep moving
WILLIAM (contd)

You listening to me David Youd

better clean that up
INT DAVID‘S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT
David showers scalding himself in the steaming spray
INT DAVID‘S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
David pulls two plates of leftovers from the oven He sets
one in front of his father who is slouched at the table
smoking David sits opposite him starts in on his dinner

Silence We sense this is a typical dynamic for these two

DAVID
How was work

WILLIAM
It sucked I got laid off again

David glances up concerned

WILLIAM (cont‘d)
Don’t give me that look

DAVID
What --

WILLIAM
I know what you’re thinking

DAVID
I wasn’t thinking anything

WILLIAM
Sure you were You were thinking
your old man’s a loser You were
thinking “Why can’t he hold onto a
job” Isnt that right

David pushes his food around with his fork doesn’t respond
He looks at a nearby clock -- it’s just after seven

WILLIAM (cont’d)
What you can’t answer me

DAVID
Just let it go Dad

William stares at his son for a beat then flicks his
cigarette across the table onto David’s plate

WILLIAM
Answer the question David

David looks up eyes pleading

DAVID
Dad please You’re upset youve
been drinking Don’t you think you
should just --

In a flash William LAUNCHES from his chair He grabs hold
of Davids shirt shoving him back against the wall

WILLIAM
Don’t you start on me David Rice
Don’t you dare

William SLAPS David across the face then raises his hand
again David pushes back tears stinging his eyes --

DAVID
Get away from me

William loses his balance then comes CHARGING BACK David
tries to shield himself

We hear the WHINING NOISE again intensifying as David slides
to the floor He shuts his eyes expecting the blows any
moment --

INT ANN ARBOR PUBLIC LIBRARY - STACKSREADING AREA - NIGHT
-- but they don’t come David opens his eyes --

DAVID (V0)
When it happened a second time I
really started getting scared

Once again David is in the library stacks -- only now it’s
night and the library is empty David rises taking stock of
himself He glances at his watch Then his eyes fall on --

DAVID (V0) (contd)
It was six minutes after seven No
time had passed None One second
I was in my kitchen and the next --

- the poster with the bespectacled badger “ESCAPE TO YOUR
LIBRARY -- OPEN A WORLD OF WONDER”

DAVID (cont’d)
The Public Library Again

David shakes his head starts towards the end of the aisle

DAVID (VO) (contd)
There’s an old Sherlock Holmes
saying -- “When you have eliminated
all which is impossible then
whatever remains however
improbable must be the truth”

David looks around the darkened library his mind racing

DAVID (cont’d)
Did I just teleport --

David lifts a trembling hand studies it

DAVID (VO) (cont‘d)
Ever since I could remember the
Public Library had been my escape
In a way it made sense -- that of
all places I’d wind up where I was
most comfortable

(beat)
So the next question was having
done it twice -- could I make it

happen again

ll

David shuts his eyes Every fiber of his being focuses
With a flourish he opens his eyes again -- only to discover
that he hasn’t moved Dejected he makes his way to --

INT ANN ARBOR PUBLIC LIBRARY - FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT

-- the front doors David tries them They’re locked

INT ANN ARBOR PUBLIC LIBRARY BACK ENTRANCE - NIGHT

An emergency exit with an “ALARM WILL SOUND” sign The door
is chained David pounds the door in frustration Then he
kicks it for good measure unleashes a barrage of blows

In his current state he doesn’t hear the STRANGE NOISE as it
swells up around him Then too late he realizes that the
door is no longer in front of him And so he falls --

INT DAVIDS HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

- onto the kitchen floor The kitchen is as he left it --
plates and silverware on the floor a chair overturned From
the livingroom we hear the TV Then FOOTSTEPS --

WILLIAM (0S)
David that you

Panicked David hauls himself up He needs to get out fast --
INT ANN ARBOR PUBLIC LIBRARY - STACKSREADING AREA - NIGHT
WHOOSH He finds himself back in the stacks by the poster
DAVID (V0)
That’s when I realized I could make
it happen on purpose Or at least

under the threat of fear

This time David consciously tries to conjure up the NOISE
He shuts his eyes The WHOOSHING overtakes the sound track

DAVID (V0) (cont’d)
I just needed practice

EXT DAVID’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

David APPEARS The world reels He wasn’t ready for the
change After steadying himself he moves to a window --

DAVID’S POV

William stands in the kitchen puzzled He picks up the
chair Moves to a cabinet and retrieves a bottle of scotch

BACK TO DAVID
He concentrates once more conjures the WHOOSHING NOISE -
INT DAVID’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

David APPEARS in his bedroom This time the world doesn’t
spin quite so much The room is a typical boy’s domain with
an emphasis on astronomy -- a poster of Armstrong by the moon
lander a photograph of a spiraling galaxy David quietly
opens his door Through the crack he spies --

HIS FATHER
Settling onto the living room couch taking a swig of scotch

David closes the door His eyes fall on a PHOTO resting on
the dresser David with his PARENTS Happier times

DAVID (V0)
Before my mother died I used to
fantasize about the two of us
running away leaving Dad one day

David removes the picture from the frame He tears off the
portion that includes his father retaining just the part
with himself and his mother

INT DAVID’S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

David creeps in Hes dressed to go outside has a duffle
bag hanging from his shoulder It’s late and only the
television is on casting a sickly glow over --

DAVID’S FATHER

Asleep on the couch shoes and one sock off the half-empty
scotch bottle resting on the coffee table by his wallet The
man is dead to the world -- mouth open breathing heavily

DAVID (V0O)
I thought about all the times Dad had
hit me and Mom --

Anger wells up in David He reaches for the scotch bottle
For a moment he considers striking his father with it --

-- but then William shifts slightly moving his lips in a dry-
mouthed stupor Like a baby might And somehow this
simple vulnerable action deflates David’s fury

David sets the bottle back down His eyes fall on the
wallet He reaches for it pulls out a few hundred dollars
tucks them in his pocket looks to his father again

DAVID (cont’d)
Goodbye Dad

EXT DAVID’S STREET - NIGHT

David passes the half-dissolved snowman his breath puffing
out in frosty plumes a sense of confidence in his stride
that was lacking the day before

EXT RURAL HIGHWAY - DAWN

A Greyhound bus escapes the outskirts of Ann Arbor
headlights piercing through the fog-bound morning air

INT GREYHOUND BUS —- DAWN

against one of the windows Blissfully asleep

The place is a dive Dirty and depressing with a few
RESIDENTS slumped in lobby chairs David stands before the
glassed-in manager’s window The CLERK a shifty-looking
grump is reading a tattered Clive Cussler paperback

CLERK
We don’t take runaways

David slips a hundred through the gap at the bottom of the
glass The clerk uses a marker to check if it’s counterfeit
Satisfied he grudgingly slides a registration card back

deposit bathroom’s down the hall

DAVID

CLERK
(handing David a key)

I see anything that looks like a
deal Ill turn you in myself

David pockets his change and the key turns to leave --

CLERK (contd)
And don’t bring home any tricks

INT HOTEL ROOM - DAY

David enters the cramped room It’s noisy with sounds of
TRAFFIC bass—-heavy RAP MUSIC and assorted SHOUTING

A window looks out onto a narrow alley David ducks his head
out -- SEES a mountain of garbage below a slice of the
street outside the hotel to the right

David retreats back inside He pulls the torn photo of he
and his mother from his coat tucks it into the frame of a
grimy wall mirror

DAVID (VO)
For the first time in my life I was
free And I was still terrified

David sits on the narrow bed He pulls his duffle bag over
Then he counts his money bills first then his change

DAVID (V0O) (cont’d)
After paying for the room I had two
hundred and sixty dollars to my name

DAVID (cont‘d)
(aloud glum)
And fifty-nine cents Now what
genius

INT FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT - DAY (MONTAGE)
A FAST-FOOD MANAGER sits across from David an application in

front of him (NOTE With each interview David becomes

COPY STORE MANAGER
I don’t care how smart talented
or hardworking you are If you

a GED we can’t hire you

INT STATE EDUCATION OFFICE - DAY (MONTAGE)
ANOTHER FEMALE EMPLOYEE sits across another desk from David

SECOND EMPLOYEE
I’m sorry but if you’re under
eighteen you need permission from
a parent or legal guardian in order
to take the GED You also need
verification of attendance from the
last school you went to You come
back with those or a birth
certificate and we can talk

David just stares back at the woman defeated

EXT CITY STREET -— NIGHT

David shuffles along finishing off a hotdog He passes a
convenience store SEES an ad for lotto tickets considers

it then spots “MUST BE 18 IN ORDER TO PLAY” and moves on

He passes an alley A PANHANDLER stands in a nearby doorway

PANHANDLER
Hey buddy you got a subway token
to spare Any change

DAVID
(fishing in his pocket)
Sure why not

Out of the corner of his eye David registers MOVEMENT in the
alley Then someone STRIKES him on the back of the head with
a piece of wood David falls consciousness snuffing out

DOGWALKERSS VOICE
Oh my God are you alright

EXT CITY STREET - LATER

David’s eyes flutter open He’s lying on the sidewalk blood
drying beneath his face He sits up tenderly exploring his
scalp A WOMAN with a French Bulldog crouches nearby
concerned A few other PEOPLE are gathered around them

DOGWALKER

DAVID
I think I was mugged --

David winces checks his pockets -- sure enough they’re
empty A JOGGER reaches for his cell phone

JOGGER
You just hold on I’1l call 911

DAVID
(standing unsteady)
No that’s alright -- they’re not
going to be able to do anything --

David takes a few uneasy steps -- the others are concerned

good --
DAVID

EXT ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
David rounds a corner woozy He tries to visualize his

hotel room For a split-second we actually SEE a FLASH of
it Then he JUMPS and he’s --

INT DAVID’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

-- there clutching at the dresser to steady himself He
looks to the vanity mirror probing under his hair

Then he SEES a FLASH of ANOTHER MIRROR -- one that opens into
a bathroom cabinet revealing band-aids aspirin --

INT DAVID’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

WHOOSH David’s hand is still outstretched but now it
touches the bathroom mirror in his father’s house He
freezes on high alert Is his father home

LIBRARY WORKER who is re-shelving books She SHOUTS and --

INT HOTEL ROOM - DAY
WHOOSH David jumps into his shoe-box room Everything is

David sinks onto his sagging bed breathing a sigh of relief

DAVID (VO)
So now I had no money And if I
didn’t figure out something soon
I’d be out on the street by the
next morning

EXT CENTRAL PARK —- STRAWBERRY FIELDS — DAY

David sits against a tree He studies a New York City
guidebook making notes We SEE home library hotel room
David flips to an entry on the Statue of Liberty

DAVID (V0)
So far I’d only jumped to places I
was familiar with But I wondered --

David studies the photo of the Statue of Liberty intently

DAVID (contd)
Statue of Liberty OK here we go

David closes his eyes bracing himself After a moment he
opens them -- but he’s still in park He frowns then flips
to a picture of the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING

David (cont‘d)

David stares at the picture zeroing in on the observation
deck As he does VOICES trickle in from the past

YOUNG DAVID‘S VOICE
Look Mom you can see the whole
world from up here

A GUARD stands on duty at the entrance of the bustling bank

DAVID (0S)
Is there a bathroom for customers

The guard sees David standing next to him shakes his head

GUARD
Up the street at the Trump Tower
They have a rest room in the lobby

DAVID

(grimacing)
Look I don’t mean to be a pain
but me and my Dad are meeting with
the Branch Manager in a couple
minutes and I really gotta pee
I‘m begging you -- isn’t there an
employees’ bathroom I could use

The guard sighs points to a door along the wall
GUARD

Through there and straight back
Be quick with it though

INT BANK OF NEW YORK - HALLWAY - DAY

David enters notes the WASHROOM He’s got his new camera
phone out Then he sees what he’s really looking for --

THE BANK VAULT

Its steel door hangs open on enormous hinges The inside of
the vault rests behind a secondary door of bars manned by an
IRON-FACED GUARD He looks at David coldly

VAULT GUARD
Can I help you

David stammers trying to see the interior of the vault
Surreptitiously he lowers the phone to his side

DAVID
Just looking for the bathroom

The Vault Guard locks at the door directly to the right of
the vault clearly labeled as the men’s rest room

VAULT GUARD
You mean that one

David ignores the sarcasm and gives his best boy scout smile

DAVID
Yeah thanks

David edges closer gaining a better view of the vault He
sees CARTS inside The carts hold canvas BAGS and stacks of
banded MONEY Gray steel shelves line the back wall

DAVID (cont’d)
That sure is a big door Do you
know how much it weighs

VAULT GUARD
A lot Now beat it

INT DAVID’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

David sits on the floor studying the screen of his new
Powerbook which is attached to his camera phone He clicks
open PHOTOS featuring the vault and the surly guard

He checks his watch -- 234 AM He slips a pair of gloves
on then a black ski mask over his head Finally he picks
up a flashlight takes a deep breath --

DAVID
Here goes nothing

INT BANK OF NEW YORK - VAULT - NIGHT

WHOOSH Darkness David’s flashlight CLICKS on
illuminating the inside of the vault The heavy door is shut
over the bars and the air is deadly still

David waits No alarms sound He pans the light around

The carts spied earlier are stacked high -- with bundled
piles of money trays of rolled coins and canvas bags with
“Bank of New York” stenciled on them

Davids eyes bulge It’s like a treasure trove He sets the
flashlight down and goes to work At the first cart he picks
up a stack of hundreds The band around the middle reads
“5000 David picks up the entire box and JUMPS--

INT DAVIDS HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

-- dumping the box onto his bed David JUMPS away again --
INT DAVID’S HOTEL ROOMBANK VAULT - CONTINUOUS

WHOOSH David reappears grabs more boxes and JUMPS

WHOOSH David dumps dozens of bundles on the hotel bed By
now there’s a virtual coverlet of money He JUMPS

Faster and faster the scene repeats itself From the vault
to his room and back again

Finally having emptied the vault of all available money
David pulls a note from his pocket setting it on one of the
now empty carts The note reads

“SORRY -- I’LL PAY IT BACK SOME DAY”
INT DAVID’S HOTEL ROOM - LATER
David stands in his room a sea of bundles and money bags
covering every surface Breathing heavily he pulls off the

He googles “TELEPORTATION” CLICK ON an ARTICLE

“scientists from the University of Innsbruck have been
able to transfer the quantum state of one atom to another
without any physical connection essentially teleporting”
INT LIBRARY - MAIN REFERENCE DESK - DAY

David approaches a FEMALE LIBRARIAN

DAVID
Hi um -- I’m trying to do some
research on teleportation Like on
Star Trek

LIBRARIAN

Well weve got an extensive
collection on Occult Sciences and
Parapsychology --

DAVID
I’ve been there already I mean
real teleportation

LIBRARIAN
Maybe you should try Fiction

LIBRARY PATRONS populate a reading room that spans two city

David aimlessly wanders the open-shelf reference section A
breeze kicks up rustling the magazine he’s flipping through

GRIFFIN Nightcrawler

A young man GRIFFIN stands beside him Griffin has
sparkling eyes and an air of nervous energy about him He’s
got a roll of Mentos in hand which he compulsively works at
peeling the wrapper chewing the candy

DAVID
I’m sorry --

GRIFFIN
The blue guy from The X-men has a
tail He’s a teleporter
(off David’s alarmed look)
I overheard you back at the
reference desk It’s not hard with
the acoustics in this place

David nods relieved Griffin offers a hand

GRIFFIN (cont‘d)
My name’s Griffin What’s yours

DAVID
David

GRIFFIN
You ever read that Dr Seuss story
Too Many Daves Some woman’s got
like fifty-seven kids all named
Dave She keeps getting confused
a bunch of crap happens --

Griffin glances up at the clouds on the mural ceilings
GRIFFIN (contd)
You think they got vertigo when
they painted those clouds

DAVID
I don’t know

Griffin shrugs looks at David There’s something “off”
about Griffin -- but then he smiles again disarming David
GRIFFIN
So you a big reader
DAVID
Yeah
GRIFFIN

Me too I come here all the time
Place is crawling with regulars
Like Sasquatch-face over there --

Griffin points to a large unkempt MAN in a flannel shirt
hunched over a stack of books

GRIFFIN (cont’d)
All he reads are books about flying
squirrels Hasn’t taken a shower
in a bajillion years stinks like
zombie turd But he’s here every
day

David smiles Then a new thought occurs to Griffin

GRIFFIN (contd)
You know theres this book by Alfred

Bester The Stars My Destination
It’s a sci-fi classic It’s about a
teleporter all these people hunting
him You should check it out

DAVID
I will

GRIFFIN
Cool Well maybe I’11 catch you
around here again sometime

Sure

INT HIGH-SCHOOL CLASSROOM DAY

As STUDENTS exit David enters finding Mr Bowker at his
desk still nursing his “GEEK INHERIT THE EARTH” mug

DAVID
Hey Mr Bowker
Bowker looks up -- and jumps like he’s seen a ghost
BOWKER
My God -- David What are you

doing here
(grabbing David by the
shoulders)
At first we thought you were dead
but then we heard you’d run away —--

DAVID
I know It’s a long story

What can David say He settles for a version of the truth
DAVID (cont’d)

The short version is things weren’t
good at home and I needed to get

out

BOWKER
But where are you living Are you
safe

DAVID

Yeah totally Don’t worry I’ve
made a whole new life for myself
back East That’s why I’m here
actually I’m in science-fiction
now and I’ve got a project I’m

researching -- I was sort of hoping
I could pick your brain for a few
minutes

Bowker looks a bit skeptical smelling bull-shit

BOWKER
You disappear for months -- and
suddenly you want to pick my brain

DAVID
Just a little

BOWKER
Alright David Fire away

DAVID
What can you tell me about
teleportation I mean people
teleporting Not just quantum
photons and stuff being moved
around How would it work

BOWKER
Well from an information theory
point of view real teleportation
should be impossible You could
never beam someone up Youd have
to rip them into a trillion
particles then reassemble them at
another location All the
computing power in the universe
could never put someone back
together in the right way

(MORE )

DAVID
Okay but we’re playing “what if”

Bowker scratches his head mulling it over

BOWKER
Well two thoughts come to mind
The first is space-folding
Essentially your teleporter would
be able to open miniature black
holes -- a kind of quantum
tunneling from one space-time
coordinate to another

DAVID
And the second thought

BOWKER

Probability density functions

(off Davids look)
In the subatomic world you can never
know for sure where a particle is
All you can guess is where it
probably will be Weve got
Heisenberg to thank for that

Bowker reaches for a teaching display -- a large-scale ATOM
with orbiting electrons He pokes an electron

BOWKER (cont’d)
Electrons move around They wiggle
We call that the Uncertainty
Principle

BOWKER (contd)
And since everything is made up of
electrons let’s extend that wiggle
to the world at large Probability
tells us that these things won’t move
very far But there’s an
infinitesimal chance --

Bowker detaches the electron in question from the rest of the
atom and tosses it to David who catches it in his hands

BOWKER (contd)
-- that these things will move a
huge amount Now let’s take your
hypothetical teleporter What if
he could control those probability
waves Theoretically he could
travel anywhere in the universe

David considers the implications of Bowker’s words

BOWKER (cont‘d)
There’s just one problem though
Whether it’s probability waves or
wormholes you poke that many
tunnels in the fabric of space-
time there’s a chance you wouldn’t
be able to plug them up again

DAVID

Meaning what

BOWKER
Meaning the whole universe could
implode But like I said
teleportation’s impossible so I
wouldn’t lose any sleep over it

David nods somewhat sobered now

BOWKER (cont’d)
So in your story David what ends
up happening to your hypothetical
teleporter

DAVID
I havent figured that out yet

BOWKER
You will Just trust your gut
The right path always presents
itself

David is touched by the subtext of Bowker’s words

DAVID
Thanks Mr Bowker Youve been a
lot of help

Bowker writes a number on an index card hands it to David

BOWKER
Listen you ever need to pick my
brain again about anything you
give me a call Alright It
doesn’t have to be just science
either I’m pretty good at real-
world stuff too Okay

DAVID
Okay

Bowker smiles but the concern he’s feeling is evident and
he’s reluctant to see him go So as David moves to exit

BOWKER
One last riddle For old times

David nods okay
BOWKER (cont’d)
The more you take the more you
leave behind What are they

David doesn’t know

BOWKER (contd)
Footsteps

through the crowd clutching an armful of books At the
moment she’s quite far away

-- and JUMPS closer behind another tree Now he’s parallel
to Millie Matching her stride He checks his surroundings --

-- and JUMPS a second time putting himself even closer
still studying her She checks her watch hurries then
seems to stumble her books spilling from her hands --

WHOOSH David jumps a THIRD TIME right in front of Millie
catching the books before they hit the ground He stands --

MILLIE

-- and Millie just stares unable to fathom his presence

DAVID
I know You thought I was dead Or
joined the circus Or abducted by
aliens

MILLIE
Where have you been all this time

DAVID

abusive and --
(shrugging)
It just seemed like a good
opportunity to wipe the slate
clean you know Reinvent myself

Now that Millie is over the shock annoyance creeps in

MILLIE

we were friends David I mean do
you have any idea how worried
everyone was

So what about you David Rice
Where do you want to go

DAVID

where Neil Armstrong landed There
are other “seas” too -- the Sea of
Serenity the Sea of Crisis

Millie widens her eyes “oohing” in mock-fear

MILLIE
So why the moon

DAVID

I don’t know I was obsessed with
it when I was a kid I remember
seeing Close Encounters and so
wanting to be Richard Dreyfuss --
the guy who’s taken away by aliens
at the end I used to fantasize
about that all the time Take me
someplace else -- where people’11
understand me where I’1ll fit in

MILLIE
I’ve felt like that before

DAVID
(surprised)
But you did fit in You were
popular

MILLIE
So That means I’m immune to
feeling alone Everybody wants to
be understood David You don’t
have a monopoly on that

David laughs

working up the nerve to kiss you

MILLIE
Every day do one thing that scares

David slowly leans in and kisses her As they part
MILLIE (cont’d)

I hate that you live in another

dresser David shrugs Millie picks it up --

MILLIE

Millie listens for a minute baffled

DAVID
Who is it

David stares into the distance hardened by the memory

DAVID
After Mom was killed they flew to
Algeria started negotiating again
Eventually the rest of the hostages
were released and the terrorists
were taken away under armed escort

That was the price for the
hostages’ release -- free passage

Presently he crests a rise In the distance he SEES --

According to the papers Khadisov
was being held in the ADX-Supermax
prison in Florence Colorado They
called it the ‘Alcatraz of the

the worst of the worst

An intimidating triangular-shaped fortress surrounded by
guard towers razor-wire and rows of electrified fencing

for every conceivable possibility --

David puts his camera away pulls out a black ski mask He
slips it on then glances at the guard tower The SECURITY

which in turn lead to a series of isolation cells David
removes his video camera records some footage

He spots a security camera mounted overhead No doubt he’s
being recorded The question is how long until he’s noticed
David finds B-ll The door is solid steel with only a narrow
slit to allow a food tray through

Suddenly an ALARM rings A CHEMICAL AGENT starts issuing
from nozzles within the walls Then a door opens ARMED
SECURITY OFFICERS wearing gas masks rush in SEE David --

David BLINKS in The cell is windowless with a bed desk
and stool made of pougerepncrete A lidless toilet

BEKKHAN KHADISOV (30s)

A gaunt man with blue eyes and a thick beard rests on his
concrete bed Upon seeing David he SCREAMS David fires a
canister of PEPPER SPRAY into Khadisov’s face As Khadisov
curls up GASPING and rubbing his eyes --

DAVID
Bekkhan Khadisov -- you’re coming
with me

-- David pulls a nylon cable tie from his backpack He binds
Khadisov’s hands and YANKS him up JUMPING them both away --

EXT EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT

They APPEAR on the deserted deck Unprepared for the jump
Bekkhan falls to the ground He looks around bewildered

BEKKHAN
Who are you

David pulls his ski mask off

DAVID
Your worst nightmare Now listen

deck of the Empire State Building
about a quarter mile above Fifth
Avenue If you don’t answer my
next question truthfully Im

to tear him from David’s grasp as --

EXT EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT

Having anticipated the jump David manages to keep his
footing -- but Bekkhan tumbles end over end The man curls
into a ball muttering in Chechen as David approaches
DAVID

Bekkhan looks up at David hissing in Chechen

BEKKHAN

DAVID
(grabbing him)
Where is he
Bekkhan CRIES OUT then caves the words coming in a torrent

BEKKHAN

David pulls his ski mask back on crouches down -—-
DAVID
If you’re lying Ill be back And
I won’t save you next time

INT SUPERMAX PRISON - ISOLATION CELL - NIGHT

David JUMPS them back to Bekkhan’s cell where ALARMS can
still be heard A second later David JUMPS away again

INT ANN ARBOR PUBLIC LIBRARY - READING AREA - NIGHT

David BLINKS into the reading area He tears off his ski-
mask hyperventilating

Feeling queasy he realizes that his nose is BLEEDING He
stares at his bloody fingertips concerned
DAVID (V0)

That night I realized I had limits

The more I jumped the bigger the

toll it took on my body I

couldn’t help wondering what price

I was paying each time I turned the

world inside out Was I slowly

killing myself

GRIFFIN (0S)
So you get nosebleeds too huh

David whips around startled --

GRIFFIN

is standing behind him On instinct David JUMPS AWAY --
INT DAVIDS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

-- only to find Griffin BLINKING IN on the couch before him

GRIFFIN
Boo

Even more startled David JUMPS yet again --
INT NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY - MAIN READING ROOM - NIGHT
-- REAPPEARING in the reference section We hear the

telltale NOISE that signals a jump Feeling the hairs on his
neck stand on end David turns as a breeze kicks up behind

him -- and Griffin is there once again

As before David stands still astonished

DAVID
You can jump

Griffin nods

DAVID (cont’d)
How

GRIFFIN
Hell if I know It just happened
one day Same as you I’m
guessing

Davids head is reeling so many questions

DAVID
But how did you find me

GRIFFIN
Practice When we jump we leave a
kind of -- quantum trail I guess

you could call it Like an energy
signature The point is it can be
sensed tuned into Maybe youve
felt it before -- a feeling like
you’re being watched

David nods the notion registering with him

GRIFFIN (contd)

Well that was me You probably
felt the same thing when I jumped

but you just didn’t know what it

was After your bank robbery in

New York it didn’t take me long to

track you down Now it’s easy

Any time you jump I can feel it

Anywhere you leap I can follow

(gesturing)
Go ahead Try it again

David thinks of a target then BLINKS away
EXT MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY

David APPEARS atop a snow-covered summit The view is
spectacular and -- theres Griffin right beside him

GRIFFIN
Neat huh

CuT TO
EXT LONG ISLAND EXPRESSWAY - BILLBOARD — DAWN
David and Griffin sit atop a billboard overlooking the

expressway watching traffic stream beneath them As before
Griffin works at a roll of Mentos

GRIFFIN
For the longest time I thought I
was alone I was super careful
always keeping what I could doa
secret But a secret’s only cool
if you can share it right

David nods understanding all too well

DAVID
Do you think there are others like
us

GRIFFIN

I don’t know I haven’t sensed
any Maybe it was a fluke thing
Maybe were it

DAVID
When’s your birthday

GRIFFIN
December twenty-second

DAVID
So we’re not twins separated at

birth

Griffin studies the flow of traffic down below

GRIFFIN
No But we are different than
other people We could spend our
whole lives trying to describe to
them what jumping’s like and theyd
never get it It sets us apart
you know It makes us unique

Griffin finishes the last of his Mentos then drops the
wrapper watches it twirl down towards the traffic below

GRIFFIN (cont‘d)
Sometimes I like to play chicken
Ill stand in a road see how close
a car can get before I jump You
should see the look on some of the
drivers’ faces Like they’re going
to crap their pants

Griffin grins at David his sense of mischief infectious

GRIFFIN (contd)
I took a photo of Paris Hilton
naked Got her coming out of the
shower right Then I thought itd
be fun to get the entire cast of
Beverly Hills 90210 You know
like a scavenger hunt

DAVID
(laughing)
You could do the old Brady Bunch
cast too Alice everybody

GRIFFIN
Or Star Trek Naked Spock
(MORE )
David winces as they both crack up After the laughter ebbs

GRIFFIN (cont’d)
I watched you pull that stunt at
the prison Pretty impressive
You planning more of those

DAVID
Why

GRIFFIN
Cause what you’ve been doing so far
is only the tip of the iceberg
You’re still on training wheels
when it comes to this I could
definitely teach you more

DAVID
Like what

GRIFFIN

Like you probably think you need to
be someplace before you can jump
there right

(shaking his head)
But a photo works just as well Or
a videotape It’s all about making
a mental map in your head You
need to start training yourself
Keep a library of jump-sites
places you can go on instinct

(beat)
But be careful

GRIFFIN(contd)
There are people out there who’d

kill for someone with our talents
Trust me I’ve met a few

DAVID
Just a business thing

Millie stares at David clearly not believing him He looks
away knowing he’s doing a bad job of covering

MILLIE

you dating someone else too

DAVID
No it’s nothing like that

MILLIE
Then what is it

DAVID
I’ve just -- ever since my Mom
died Ive never really been able

risk getting hurt again That’s
why they call it “falling in love”
Not walking not strolling
Falling You have to give up
control You have to jump and hope
the other person catches you

DAVID
What if they don’t

It could happen They could let
you down They could leave you
They could die

the one thing they had in common
was a hatred of the US

Please won’t you have a seat

David hesitates considering his options -- he’s just too
caught off guard at the moment to do anything David sits

Excellent Lets start at the
beginning shall we On April
ninth of last year you fell into
the Huron River Shortly
thereafter you disappeared Since
that time you’ve been living in
New York with no visible means of
financial support Am I correct so
far

David left in the bank “SORRY I’LL PAY IT BACK SOME DAY”

What about this note Is this your
handwriting

suspicious wearing the same clothes that he’s wearing now

before the first in King Khalid

the authorities there have no
record of you actually clearing
immigration or customs Moments
after this photo was taken you
were seen entering a washroom But
when the washroom was searched you
had disappeared

So well go public find a lawyer --

DAVID
Don’t be naive Millie I’m too
valuable to them They can’t
afford to let me go free Can you
imagine what someone like me could
do if they wanted to screw things
up I could smuggle a nuclear
warhead into the White House I
could take anthrax anything

Find Matar I owe my mother that

MILLIE
And if you get him what then
Have you even thought it through

Dawn is cresting over the Eastern horizon casting an eerie
glow over the Great Sphinx which sits just down the
escarpment from the pyramids of Giza Atop the Sphinx’s head
sit TWO TINY FIGURES

GRIFFIN’S VOICE
Dude I tried to warn you

CLOSER

We find David and Griffin perched looking into the sunrise
Griffin has a small pocket-knife in his hands He’s using it
to clean his fingernails

DAVID
You could’ve been more specific
GRIFFIN
I was feeling you out being
cautious
(pointedly)
Which is something you havent
been
DAVID

So they know about jumping
Griffin pauses deciding to level with David

GRIFFIN
I started jumping a few years ago
I was stupid I made waves
Before long that bastard Cox had
me under lock and key his people
poking and prodding me like I was
some kind of lab animal trying to
figure out how I do what I do
They called their little program
‘Project Spirit’

DAVID
You couldn’t just jump away

Griffin shakes his head then lifts up his shirt showing
David a symmetrical series of scars near his collarbone

GRIFFIN
They put some kind of implant in
me They called it a ‘governor’
When I tried to escape it gave me
seizures I was like a dog ona
leash It took me six months to
figure out how to get free And
even then I had to cut myself open
to get the damn thing out Dont
kid yourself my friend There’s
no negotiating with these people
They won’t ever let up They
can’t The hunt’s part of their
goddamn DNA

Theres an edge to Griffin now a sense of fury that was
hidden before And David can’t help wondering just how close
a call he himself might‘ve narrowly escaped
GRIFFIN (cont‘d)
So You want Matar And I want
Cox Maybe we could help each
other out Take it to the next
level

DAVID
Which is what

GRIFFIN
You ever hear of Marvel Team-up
It was a comicbook A combo book
Two super-heroes joining forces
They had another one too -- Marvel
Two-In-One

DAVID
(nodding)
I know it And DC Comics had The
Brave and the Bold

GRIFFIN
Right Now just think what the two
of us could do together Anything

I mean no one could stop us That
million dollars you stole That’s
nothing We could take over the
world if we wanted to

DAVID
I don’t want to take over the
world I just want to be left
alone

GRIFFIN

But that’s not going to happen
Were different David I keep
telling you that You want to make
a impact Think bigger Pick a
bad guy Saddam Hussein That guy
in North Korea

(snapping his fingers)
We could’ve taken them out like
that

Griffin gestures to the East impassioned

GRIFFIN (contd)
You see that sunrise out there
That’s ours No one else is ever
gonna see this view
(closer intense)

All those rules we grew up with
dont apply anymore David We
need to make our own rules now

Griffin makes a compelling case

DAVID
I need to think about all this

GRIFFIN
You do that And watch your back
while youre at it cause Cox’s
dogs are gonna be on you the moment
you let your guard down

drawing David’s attention to an inscription Griffin just

containing the remainder of the stolen money

We find David on the floor of the cave scanning the

Once I’d settled in I was ready to

his ”GEEK SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH” mug sips coffee --

DAVID (0S)
Hows it going Mr Bowker

David stands in the doorway exhausted Mr Bowker freezes

DAVID (cont‘d)
Before you freak on me just hear
me out for a minute alright

Mr Bowker nods nervous David enters shutting the door

DAVID (cont’d)
I’m assuming the Government’s been
here Well whatever they told you
is bullshit They’re after me but
not because I’ve done what they
say

BOWKER
Then why do they want you

DAVID
Watch

David JUMPS REAPPEARING ten feet away Bowker’s “GEEK”
coffee mug drops to the floor and shatters

INT CLEARY HIGH-SCHOOL - CLASSROOM LATER

David and Mr Bowker are at the back of the classroom Some
time has passed Bowker meanwhile is setting up a video
camera on a tripod framing up a shot of David while he
listens The camera is wired to a nearby monitor

DAVID
-- so thats it They took her
And now they’re using her as
leverage

BOWKER
Then you need to find a way to
leverage them back

DAVID
(re equipment)
So why are we wasting our time with
this

BOWKER
Because there may be something to be
seen in slow motion Now do it again
-- but jump right back after a count
of five alright

David nods JUMPS --

EXT ALGIERS-HOUARI BOUMEDIENNE AIRPORT - DAY

David APPEARS near one of the runways He looks around SEES
a nearby Alitalia Jet David counts to five then JUMPS --

INT CLEARY HIGH-SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - NIGHT

-- back to the science classroom Even though Mr Bowker is
expecting him he starts when David blinks back

DAVID
Sorry

Mr Bowker rewinds the tape plays it back at normai speed
ON THE MONITOR

David stands near a science display then he’s gone After
five seconds he reapg4RB)on the tape

BOWKER
Ill try it on super slow

He rewinds the tape again plays it back at slower speed
They lean in close watching Davids image disappear again

BOWKER (contd)
There just as you jumped There
was a flash of something -- well
go again Frame-by-frame

Bowker rewinds the tape to the moment before David jumps
then advances using the still button and the frame-advance

BOWKER (cont‘d)
There -- what’s that

The video image held wavering on the screen goes from David
standing to a rough outline of him a DAVID-SHAPED HOLE
Inside the hole is the Alitalia jet as seen from the tarmac

DAVID
It’s a jetway in Algeria

Bowker advances again and the David-shaped window disappears

BOWKER
Did you see that hole You’re not
disappearing one place and appearing
in another you‘re going through a
doorway That explains why you can
take things with you

BOWKER (contd)
Now watch as I keep forwarding frame-
by-frame You should see that hole
open up again --

Mr Bowker single-frames until ANOTHER DAVID-SHAPED DOORWAY
appears The view is a different slice of the Alitalia jet
reflecting where David had stood when he jumped back

BOWKER (cont’d)
See

DAVID
What would happen if I couldn’t go
through that door Like if I were
handcuffed to something

MINUTES LATER

David stands by a water pipe running up the classroom wall
His left wrist has been “handcuffed” to the pipe via loops of
heavy-gauge wire Mr Bowker has trained the camera on him

DAVID (contd)
Ready

Mr Bowker nods David PARTIALLY BLINKS AWAY -- for just a
second -- then he FLICKERS back SCREAMING in pain

® DAVID (cont’d)

Aaghghh --
David drops to his knees in agony Mr Bowker rushes over

MR BOWKER
Are you alright

DAVID
(gasping in pain)
Just cut me free

Mr Bowker reaches for a pair of wire cutters freeing
David’s wrist David cradles his left hand The area where
the wire was looped around it is bleeding lacerated

BOWKER
So now we know -- if you can’t take
something with you through the gate
it pulls you back

Mr Bowker pauses ruminating over something

BOWKER (contd)

But I wonder -- what if you
deliberately tried to oscillate
between two locations Back and
forth as quickly as you can Are
you up for one last experiment

DAVID
I guess --

BOWKER
Try somewhere else again

A bit gun-shy from the memory of his last attempt David
concentrates VISUALIZING the Chihuahuan desert

EXT EL SOLITARIO - BOX CANYON - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

David BLINKS in atop the ridge overlooking the box canyon
Then just as quickly he BLINKS AWAY again

INT CLEARY HIGH-SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

David returns then FLICKERS AWAY again Back and forth his

figure taking on a STROBOSCOPIC APPEARANCE Presently the

DAVID-SHAPED WINDOW becomes visible in real-time (NOTE
This process will be referred to as “twinning”)

Mr Bowker stares awestruck He can SEE through David onto
the mountain plateau Even more incredible --— WIND blows

through the quantum gateway tousling Mr Bowker’s hair
EXT EL SOLITARIO - BOX CANYON - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Now we are on the other side of the gateway looking back
“through” David at Mr Bowker Mr Bowker’s hand extends
towards us picking up a rock on the ground --

INT CLEARY HIGH-SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

-- pulling it back through the gateway into the classroom
Mr Bowker looks at the rock in his palm marvelling at it

David slows his jumps The desert wind ebbs The window
flickers closed David is now firmly back in the classroom

DAVID
That was weird It was like I was
in two places at once

BOWKER
If you kept that gateway open long
enough I imagine you could bring
all sorts of things through

We hear a HELICOPTER Mr Bowker moves to a window
MR BOWKER’S POV (OUTSIDE)

A helicopter circles overhead POLICE CRUISERS and UNMARKED
CARS are converging on the school as well SIRENS flashing

BOWKER (cont‘d)
Looks like your friends are here

DAVID
Griffin said they’d never stop

BOWKER
Why should they They’ve got you
on the defensive Everything
you’re doing is reactive You need
to turn the board around Do
something they’d never expect

DAVID
Like what

BOWKER
Take the battle to them Stop
screwing around with their pawns
They took your queen fine So go

after their king

David takes in Bowker’s words

DAVID
Thanks for helping me Mr Bowker

BOWKER
The names Don okay I’m not your
teacher anymore I’m your friend

David nods and Bowker wraps him in a fatherly hug For a
moment it looks like David might even lose it Then they
part and Bowker fixes David with a close-quarters gaze

BOWKER (cont’d)
Listen to me No matter what they
do no matter what kind of double-
speak they throw at you -- you’re
still the smartest primate in the
room okay Youre clever David
You always have been

David nods again knowing their time is up He JUMPS AWAY --

Tell me something Cox -- was that
hijacking in Algeria even real

COX
It was real Just the part about
Matar was fabricated We leaked
that hoping it would draw you out

David shakes his head at this amazed at their audacity

DAVID
You guys are unbelievable

Cox averts his gaze uncomfortable He sighs

cox
What would you have us do We were
in a no-win situation You have to
understand -- the idea of a person
like you or Griffin being loose in
the world is untenable It’s
terrifying to us

DAVID
I‘m not a killer Cox I told you
that

Cox
(pointedly)

And I believe you

DAVID
(frustrated)
So why are you doing this I just
want to live my life I just want
to be left alone

Cox
Look David you may be wary of us -
- and youd be right to be but
we’re still your best option right
now If you’ve got any sense at
all if you do nothing else you’1l
help us stop Griffin

Why

COX
Because no one is safe if he’s
loose in the world including

yourself
David studies Cox another beat trying to read him then
starts off down the beach Cox calls out to him

planning something there

David sits next to a cheerful Egyptian PILOT As they reach
the Argos and begin a wide circle David uses his binoculars

DAVID’S POV (THROUGH BINOCULARS )

The ship is a over a hundred yards long A bridge deck sits
forward of the smokestack a cabin deck with a pool at the
back and below that a level with a large sunbathing deck at
the back TWO MEN with machine guns (Terrorist’s 1 and 2)
stand on the bridge deck roof looking at the helicopter

The pilot listens to his radio and looks at David surprised
PILOT
I’m réceiving direction from the
army to clear away from the ship
David nods training his binoculars on potential jump-sites
He chooses a spot behind the smokestack Just then the
terrorists atop the bridge FIRE at them

DAVID
Get out of here

The helicopter dips and spins as the pilot takes evasive
Maneuvers David loosens his safety harness and JUMPS

EXT ARGOS CRUISE SHIP - DAY

David APPEARS by the smokestack Using his dentist’s mirror
David peers around the corner

DAVID’S POV (IN DENTIST’S MIRROR)

He can only see one of the terrorists on the bridge Every
so often the terrorist lifts a radio to his lips and speaks

At the back of the bridge deck is a door David JUMPS beside
it uses the mirror again -- a narrow door-lined passage
leads forward to the bridge itself Nobody is in sight

INT ARGOS - PASSAGEWAY —- DAY

David eases his way in checking out the open doorways with
the mirror He’s almost reached the radio room when he hears
a CHAIR CREAK and a FOOTSTEP scruff the floor

David JUMPS OUTSIDE by the rear door peeks into the passage -
- he SEES a THIRD TERRORIST stepping onto the bridge

David JUMPS BACK by the radio room The mirror shows it
empty Easing forward past the captain’s cabin David looks
into the bridge itself nobody The wheel stands motionless

A stairway descends on both sides of the bridge Overhead
David hears FOOTSTEPS -- one of the men on the roof The man
from the radio room went right David takes the left route
very slowly --

EXT ARGOS - CABIN DECK - DAY

The stairways open on the next deck outside David eases
the port door open and walks close to the walls shielding
himself from the two men above A door leads to --

INT ARGOS - CABIN DECK DAY

-- a central compartment a large stairwell in the middle
corridors lined with staterooms David passes Reception
There’s a MAP OF THE SHIP on the wall and David studies it

Ahead is another stairwell leading downward David hears
VOICES and eases down the carpeted stairway

AT THE BOTTOM

another hallway runs down the center of the boat On the
port side is a glass door labeled COFFEE LOUNGE On the
starboard side is a hallway leading forward from which the
VOICES are coming David peers carefully around the corner

DAVID’S POV (THROUGH DOORWAY)

We are looking into the main lounge About seventy feet
forward a MAN stands his back to us machine gun ready

Beyond the man we SEE PEOPLE crowded together sitting on the
furniture or the floor The doorway frames only a small
segment of that space but there are a lot of people visible

BACK TO DAVID

He goes into the coffee lounge on the other side It’s
deserted Another glass door at the far end is labeled BAR
but that door is locked David JUMPS to the other side

INT ARGO - SHIP’S BAR — DAY

This room is pure men’s club dark wood paneling and leather-
upholstered chairs A glass door at the far end is
curtained David pushes the curtain slightly aside

DAVID’S POV (INTO MAIN LOUNGE)

The passengers look distressed Nobody is talking The CREW
is also there officers and deckhands in whites waiters and
waitresses in dark uniforms maids in aprons

The CAPTAIN sits in a chair surrounded by his officers on
the floor His face is impassive but his hands keep turning
his hat around and around

All told there are SIX TERRORISTS in the lounge

DAVID (VO)
The lady who’d been released was
wrong There were at least eight
terrorists in all Six in the
lounge and two on the bridge deck

Four terrorists hold guns on the crowd Another two are in
conference One is the man from the radio room The other

RASHID MATAR

The radio room man leaves As Matar turns David sees a
TRANSMITTER hanging from his neck with a red button on it

DAVID (VO) (contd)
Matar I couldnt believe it Id
finally found him

David looks at the other terrorists They carry Uzis
grenades and gun belts While they also have the holstered
radios they don’t seem to have bomb transmitters

David JUMPS back to the coffee shop to think He’s sweating
bullets In the lounge someone is CRYING One of the
terrorists SHOUTS The situation is escalating David JUMPS
back to the bar and peeks past the curtains

DAVID’S POV (THE MAIN LOUNGE)

One of the men (Terrorist 4) is taking passengers to the
bathroom in relays of four

paces back and forth occasionally speaking on his radio
The detonator swings back and forth on his neck lanyard

INT ARGOS - POOL DECK - DAY

the passageway to the pool There’s another bar poolside

EXT ARGOS - POOL DECK - DAY

Shielded from the terrorists on the bridge roof by the bar
awning David looks over the side -- a thirty-foot drop to
the water David studies the railing carefully then JUMPS --

INT ARGOS —- CABIN DECK - DAY
-- back to the original bar He brushes aside the curtains
DAVID’S POV (MAIN LOUNGE)

The next group of passengers are herded to the bathroom
This leaves three men (Terrorists 5 6 and 7) in the
lounge and Matar pacing up and down between them

DAVID (V0)

I’‘d have to go after Matar first
and pray he had the only detonator
So this was it -- my big chance to
play hero

(beat)
But everyone knows a hero is only
as good as his villain

David takes a deep breath readying himself Behind him we
suddenly glimpse a FIGURE Before David even knows what’s
happening the figure TASERS him in the shoulder David
drops in agony

David manages another flickering HALF-JUMP only a yard or
so but then he just collapses altogether

Griffin kneels alongside David grabbing him by the hair
pulling his face up so they’re nose to nose

in his waist-band

of his mother’s grave He grab’s Matar by the scruff of his
neck PUSHES his face towards the headstone

DAVID
There Take a look Is the name
familiar Matar Tell me you
remember her

Matar frowns The name rings a bell but he can’t place it

DAVID (contd)
She was a flight attendant You
murdered her in Cyprus You blew
her up on a runway
(shaking him)
Tell me why you killed her TELL
ME

Matar slowly nods realization dawning on him We think he’s
going to unleash a stream of vitriol in response but his
voice is remarkably calm and measured

MATAR
Your mother was a signal and
nothing more A message to your
leaders You should be proud She
died for a just cause She was a
Martyr

DAVID
Why her Why did you pick her

MATAR
(shrugging)
I can hardly recall anymore --
(beat half-smiling)
Perhaps I thought she had a pretty
face

And there it is The sum of David’s tragedy reduced to a
simple random act David just stares at Matar -- horrified
Then he snaps --

David HITS him Matar falls backwards scrambles to rise --
but David JUMPS behind him STRIKING again Then he JUMPS to
Matar’s other side PUNCHING him in the stomach

As Matar doubles over David KICKS him in the face Matar
crumples rolling away into a ball trying to cover his head
David drops onto Matar PUNCHING him He’s crying tears
blinding him as his blows become increasingly less directed

Finally he collapses atop Matar SOBBING Then he abruptly
backs away reaching for the handgun he’d tucked in his belt
Funneling all his frustration into this moment David brings
the gun up aiming it at Matar’s head --

-- then David SCREAMS and points the qun into the trees
FIRING until it’s empty Birds take wing as the shots ECHO
oUT David lowers the gun dropping it to the ground

Matar is stunned to find himself still alive

Get up Turn around

Matar complies cautiously rising to his feet turning
David steps closer JUMPS them away --

EXT SUPERMAX PRISON YARD - COLORADO —- NIGHT

David deposits Matar in the midst of the prison yard Matar
looks around taking in the walls the guard towers

DAVID
Welcome home

EXT EL SOLITARIO - BOX CANYON - NIGHT

David sits atop the wind-swept cliff staring off into
nothingness Tears streak his face He seems dead inside

DAVID (V0)

Nothing ever turns out the way you
think it will I’d found my
mother’s killer but she was still
gone Now Millie was too

(beat)
Which left me nowhere I hadn’t
accomplished anything And what
was I going to do with Cox Let
him starve to death Let his kids
grow up without a father What was
the point

David knuckles the tears from his eyes and stands He’s made
a decision

EXT HOWLAND ISLAND - NIGHT

David walks up the beach to the grove of palm trees where Cox
has been sheltered A CAMPFIRE is burning near the tent

DAVID
Wake up Cox

No answer David approaches the tent looks inside It’s
empty David CALLS OUT

DAVID (cont’d)
cox

Again no answer Then David notices something on the ground
-- a HARDBACK BOOK face-down with the pages splayed open

David picks it up It’s a copy of “THE STARS MY
DESTINATION” Inside the front cover is a stamp from the New
York Public Library And beneath that a handwritten note

“WE NEED TO TALK”
INT LIBRARY —- MAIN READING ROOM — NIGHT

David APPEARS at the end of the cavernous room It’s after-
hours and the place is deserted He’s scans the tables

GRIFFIN

Sits at the far end waiting for David He raises his hand
David approaches taking his time his FOOTSTEPS echoing

GRIFFIN

“Lo There Shall Be An Ending”
You remember that title From
Fantastic Four 43 You ever
wonder why the comics used such
crazy titles

(quoting more)
“If This Be Doomsday” “Where
Stalks The Sandman” “Frenzy At
Fifty Fathoms”

David stops in front of Griffin

DAVID
Where did you take Cox

A mostly eaten roll of Mentos rests on the table the foil
wrapper peeled away in a nice spiral Griffin pops the final
one in his mouth chews Smiles teasingly

Griffin
Why don’t you see if you can follow
me Concentrate Think real hard
Griffin VANISHES the wind shifting the Mentos wrapper

DAVID (V0)
So I did

David stares at the space Griffin vacated fists clenched --
DAVID (V0) (cont‘d)
At first I felt nothing He was
gone Without a trace

Gradually a subtle PATTERN OF DISTORTION emerges from the
air And within this pattern we glimpse ANOTHER PLACE

DAVID (VO) (cont’d)
But then I felt something A
memory of a place I’d never been
before I tried to visualize it --
The IMAGE before David is hazy We see MACHINERY --

DAVID (V0) (contd)
-- and in a heartbeat --

David FLASHES from view

DAVID (V0) (contd)
-- I was there

INT INDUSTRIAL BUILDING - DAY

David APPEARS in a sprawling decrepit industrial facility
Once a factory now it’s just a husk -- rusted beams and
columns crumbling walls and concrete floors

cox

Is there chained by his wrist to a metal column David
JUMPS closer Cox is unkempt unshaven He has a bruise on
his cheek a split lip

DAVID
You alright

cox
(dryly)
The accommodations you provided
were a bit better

David crouches inspecting the chains that bind Cox

DAVID (VO)
Griffin had been smart The chains
meant I couldn’t jump Cox away

We hear the subtle implosion of displaced air and David turns
-- finding Griffin behind him holding a pistol

GRIFFIN
You made it Great Lesson One
learned Give yourself a gold
star And now now I think it’s
time for Lesson Two

DAVID
(tiredly)
Just let him go Griffin Walk
away stay out of my life and I‘1ll
stay out of yours

GRIFFIN
Unfortunately that’s not really an
option anymore See the problem
is I’ve got plans And the only
person on the planet who could
possibly interfere with those plans
is you So what do I do Just go
about my business knowing you’re
out there Wondering whether or
not you’ll decide to jack me around
one day Even if you were willing
to let me go which I don’t buy --
what if they catch you What if
they force you to go after me

(shaking his head)

I don’t think so

DAVID
Then what

GRIFFIN
I kill you Or --
(nodding to Cox)
-- you kill him It’s your choice

DAVID
And what’1l that accomplish

GRIFFIN

It‘ll show me you’re willing walk
the walk That you’ve got a
backbone You take a man’s life
it changes you

(beat)
I want you changed David I want
us on the same page

David shakes his head That‘s never going to happen

DAVID
If I kill him I’11l never see
Millie again I only have leverage
on them if he’s alive

GRIFFIN
Well I don’t want him alive

A long beat David considers his options Then

DAVID
You forgot one

Griffin just stares at David confused

DAVID (cont’d)
Back when you wanted us to work
together All those super-hero
combo books you were listing You
forgot a title

GRIFFIN
Oh yeah

DAVID
Super-Villain Team-Up It starred
Dr Doom and The Submariner They
made a pact joined forces

GRIFFIN
And

DAVID
Things didn’t work out so well in
that one

Without warning Griffin snaps his gun up and FIRES at
Davids head

Time dilates We witness a slow-motion jump David
vanishes just in time And as time ramps back up again --

WHOOSH David REAPPEARS opening a wormhole at Griffins
side knocking the other man back some ten feet Griffin

goes sliding backwards on his ass FIRING as he does so --

David KEEPS JUMPING one step ahead of the bullets He goes
from mid-air jump to mid-air jump like he’s running along a
series of invisible stepping stones Finally he connects
with Griffin KICKING him across the face then vanishing
Griffin also BLINKS AWAY The game is on

EXT EL SOLITARIO - BOX CANYON - DAY

David APPEARS on the ledge overlooking the oasis Griffin
BLINKS IN alongside him taking a moment to get his bearings --

David quickly JUMPS a half-dozen times raining blows on
Griffin from every direction Griffin retreats --

EXT JUNGLE DAY

WHOOSH Griffin APPEARS in riot of tangled green deep in
the Amazon David APPEARS as well and Griffin FIRES his gun
again narrowly missing David David JUMPS AWAY --

INT FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE - DAY

- and retrieves a cannister of mace from his bookshelf

EXT JUNGLE - DAY

David RETURNS to the jungle SPRAYING mace at Griffin’s face
Griffin SCREAMS dropping the gun David TACKLES Griffin
around the mid-section and the two of them go tumbling --

-- off a ledge into a vine-covered ravine They TUMBLE then
Griffin manages to catch hold of David’s shirt --

EXT RIVER - DAY

WHOOSH David and Griffin materialize amidst a stretch of
river rapids Griffin quickly JUMPS to --

SOME ROCKS ON THE SHORE

Watching as David struggles to right himself David goes
under some white-water VANISHES -—-

INT NYC PUBLIC LIBRARY - ASTOR HALL - DAY

-- and REAPPEARS soaking wet near the front entrance

Even as Griffin BLINKS IN David JUMPS again then a SECOND
then a THIRD TIME appearing on the stairs the upper
balcony then back by the doors SUCKER-PUNCHING Griffin --

Griffin TWISTS elbowing David in the gut Again and again
they JUMP opening wormholes using the energy of the
expanding and collapsing mini black holes to buffet each other
about

What unfolds is a bravura performance with both young men
utilizing the immensely powerful jump forces in a far more
directed way than previously witnessed

We realize that theyre both completely in control of the
process now -- actually directing the river of energy
unleashed in each jump and not simply being carried along
with it

Once again David manages to grab Griffin JUMPING them both --
EXT AVE OF THE AMERICAS - NYC - DAY

-- into the middle of the street Downtown TRAFFIC rushing
all around them A double-decker tour bus is bearing down
about to flatten them both --

Griffin DISAPPEARS David JUMPS six feet to the side
narrowly avoiding the bus as it ROARS PAST He touches his
nose -- it’s bleeding Already he’s pushing himself past
his limits When David looks up he SEES --

GRIFFIN ATOP THE BUS
Grinning as the bus speeds away Baiting David

David climbs to his feet running between the speeding
traffic A car BRAKES SLEWING TOWARDS him --

David JUMPS to the other side of the car as it side-swipes a
cab He keeps running JUMPING dozens of yards forward every
few strides quickly catching up to the bus He JUMPS --

-- landing atop the bus as Griffin BLINKS AWAY again back
down into the snarl of traffic

Now Griffin and David are both in the path of an on-coming
semi David JUMPS away But Griffin sidesteps it like a
matador deftly opening a wormhole which envelops both he and
the speeding truck --

EXT MOUNTAIN TOP - NIGHT

WHOOSH David has jumped to safety atop the snow-covered

summit - only Griffin has followed bringing the speeding
semi along with him

David JUMPS some twenty feet straight up the rocketing semi
plowing through just underneath him It SMASHES into the

side of the mountain sending an avalanche of snow spraying
outwards --

David JUMPS further away into mid-air again But Griffin is
there as well SLAMMING David --

INT NIGHT

-- into the aisle of a completely full passenger plane The
PASSENGERS SCREAM David gets a knee up between himself and

Griffin PIVOTING Griffin over his head

As David somersaults back up Griffin plants a foot into
David’s side KNOCKING him backwards Griffin continues his
assault JUMPING them both --

EXT MID-AIR - NIGHT

-- outside the 747 Now both of them are tumbling at 30000
feet David spirals concentrates --

EXT EL SOLITARIO - BOX CANYON - DAY

-- APPEARING only a dozen feet above the water He SPLASHES
down then surfaces and quickly JUMPS --

INT ANN ARBOR PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

-- LANDING on the floor of the reading area with a THUD
Startled PATRONS gasp Then Griffin appears again --

-- but David is ready He seems to SENSE where Griffin is
going to appear and STRIKES OUT with his fist PUNCHING
Griffin in the face as he BLINKS IN Griffin drops to his
knees David follows with an UPPERCUT --

-- then Griffin manages to restrain David He THROWS David
onto the floor straddling him as he wraps his hands around
David’s throat Griffin SQUEEZES with all his strength

Panicked David JUMPS --

INT ROSE CENTER FOR EARTH AND SPACE - DAY

-- onto the walkway in Hayden Planetarium But Griffin is
still atop David squeezing his life away David JUMPS -

EXT CEMETARY - DAY

-- beside his mother’s grave He’s not thinking anymore

just jumping on instinct -- and Griffin is still there
GRIFFIN
Die god-damnit DIE

Davids face is crimson He reaches for Griffin’s fingers
trying to pry them from his throat JUMPS AGAIN --

INT CLEARY HIGH-SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

-- into the middle of Mr Bowker’s classroom No one is
there Just David and Griffin -- and Griffin isn’t letting
up Davids efforts are lessening He’s losing strength
If he doesnt do something drastic he’1l die

A MEMORY FLASH
Mr Bowker in the very same room
BOWKER
But I wonder -- what if you
deliberately tried to oscillate
between two locations
Then later --
BOWKER (cont‘d)
If you kept that gateway open long
enough I imagine you could bring
all sorts of things through

BACK TO HERE AND NOW

David lets go of Griffin’s hands -- and FLICKERS just like
before Back and forth faster and faster And as he
flickers we glimpse ANOTHER PLACE -- sea water David is

twinning Griffin sits back releasing his death-grip --

GRIFFIN
What are you doing

GHOST DAVID
A trick you haven’t learned yet

EXT TIGZIRT - BEACH - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

David APPEARS out amidst the waves -- a FLICKERING GHOST

the classroom Griffin’s surprised face

INT CLEARY HIGH-SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY - (CONTINUOUS)

of gallons at once Griffin is BLOWN BACKWARDS sent
spinning ass-over-tea-kettle Everything else in the room is
instantly buoyed about -- desks chairs bookcases

INT CLEARY HIGH-SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY - (CONTINUOUS)

A DELUGE surges out the classroom door filling the hallway
waist-deep in seconds And the water keeps coming

EXT CLEARY HIGH-SCHOOL - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

Outside the classroom a FLOOD EXPLODES the windows outward
sending a TIDAL WAVE of water onto the school grounds

EXT TIGZIRT - BEACH NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

Out at sea Davids flickering form re-solidifies He’s
firmly in one place again He DIVES beneath the waves --

EXT TIGZIRT - BEACH - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

David swims looking for Griffin He SEES the other man
ahead disoriented trying to find his way to the surface

DAVID (V0)
I knew Id only bought myself
seconds If I was going to end it
it had to be right then --

David grips Griffin’s wrist Then he reaches his other hand
into his back pocket pulling out a pair of HANDCUFFS

DAVID (V0O) (cont’d)
Id planned for it I knew I had
to take him someplace he could
never return from --

David struggles in the water locking one of the cuffs around
Griffins wrist JUMPING them both away --

EXT TRANQUILITY BASE - THE MOON - NIGHT

Earthrise over the moon David and Griffin APPEAR upon a
level plain dotted with craters and small boulders

saltwater pour through the wormhole with them splashing out
in slow-motion waves (due to the moon’s lesser gravity) then
instantly flash-freezing and shattering apart in the sub-zero
environment

Because they were in the ocean hundreds of gallons of

DAVID (VO)
- even if it meant I was stuck
there as well

Nearby is the abandoned Lunar Module Father out more
Apollo 11 debris including the flag that Armstrong planted

Griffin falls to the ground covered in ice his eyes wide as
the zero vacuum of space attacks his body He claws at his
throat his blood beginning to boil within him

David is succumbing as well With all his might he THROWS
himself forward grabbing Griffin’s handcuffed wrist --

-- SNAPPING the other ring of the handcuff around one of the
Lunar Module’s legs Even in his death throes Griffin

realizes what’s happening But it’s too late

David LURCHES BACK his eyes rolling to whites He’s
blacking out As he falls he tries to visualize safety --

INT ADAMS COWLEY SHOCK TRAUMA CENTER - NIGHT

David APPEARS in the center of the busy emergency room
startling a number of PEOPLE He collapses to the floor
convulsing blood bubbling from his mouth and nostrils

ER STAFF rush to David’s side among them is the nurse we saw
before As they struggle to determine what’s wrong TIME
SLOWS Their CRIES and EFFORTS become muted

DAVID (V0O)
According to the experts a person
can survive in the zero vacuum of
space for about a minute After
ten seconds they would probably
lose consciousness By my count I
lasted seven before the world
turned black

(beat)
I remember wondering if I’d killed
myself

CLOSE ON David’s face an oxygen mask now strapped over his
mouth His eyes flutter then close

FADE TO BLACK

to do the right thing and hope you
do the same by setting Millie free

(beat)
We just want to be left alone Cox
We just want to live our lives

David unlocks the handcuffs binding Cox’s wrist Cox
massages the wrist in question still wary

CcOx

I’ll call If I can help you with

(emphatic)
But I’m not a spy I’m not an
agent This has to be on my terms
We do things for the greater good
or we don’t do them at all And I
expect to be paid for it

(off Coxs look)
I still owe that million dollars

Cox nods They pause having come to the edge of the Diag
Out on the street a BLACK LIMOUSINE pulls to a stop After
a beat Millie climbs from the back seat waves

Every once in a while though you
find someone who bucks the trend

“CHANUTE KANSAS” written on it Millie looks up puzzled

-- you have to marry me first

Millie stares at David a tortuous beat Then she smiles

MILLIE
Then I guess we’d better hit Vegas
along the way

DAVID
Done

David snaps his fingers The air shimmers and a JUMP-WINDOW

opens before them But this time the extreme gravitational

forces involved are held in check No violent winds Just a
gentle breeze And revealed through the window

A VIEW OF THE LITTLE WHITE CHAPEL

In Vegas complete with a sign outside advertising a “24 HOUR
DRIVE-UP WEDDING WINDOW”

My name is David Rice I was born
on April ninth the same day as
