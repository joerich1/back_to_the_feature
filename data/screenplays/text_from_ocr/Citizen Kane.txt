EXT XANADU - FAINT DAWN - 1940 (MINIATURE)
Window very small in the distance illuminated
All around this is an almost totally black screen Now as
the camera moves slowly towards the window which is almost a
postage stamp in the frame other forms appear barbed wire
cyclone fencing and now looming up against an early
sky enormous iron grille work Camera travels up what is

shown to be a gateway of gigantic proportions and holds on

top of it - a huge initial K showing darker and darker

the dawn sky Through this and beyond we see the fairy-tale
mountaintop of Xanadu the great castle a sillhouette as its
summit the little window a distant accent in the darkness

Kane acquired and changed its face - it is now pleasantly
uneven with its fair share of rolling hills and one very

sized mountain all man-made Almost all the land is
either through cultivation for farming purposes of through
careful landscaping in the shape of parks and lakes The
castle dominates itself an enormous pile compounded of

genuine castles of European origin of varying architecture

dominates the scene from the very peak of the mountain

WHAT WAS ONCE A GOOD-SIZED ZOO (MINIATURE)
Of the Hagenbeck type All that now remains with one
exception are the individual plots surrounded by moats on

which the animals are kept free and yet safe from each

indicate that here there were once tigers lions girrafes)

been accompanying the sequence In the glass panes of the

window we see reflected the ripe dreary landscape of Mr
Kanes estate behind and the dawn sky

holding the ball relaxes The ball falls out of his hand

NOTE Here follows a typical news digest short one of the
regular monthly or bi-monthly features based on public

or personalities These are distinguished from ordinary
newsreels and short subjects in that they have a fully

A great number of headlines set in different types and
different styles obviously from different papers all
announcing Kanes death all appearing over photographs of
Kane himself (perhaps a fifth of the headlines are in
foreign
languages) An important item in connection with the
headlines
is that many of them - positively not all - reveal
passionately

conflicting opinions about Kane Thus they contain
variously

the words patriot democrat pacifist war-monger

very

much made out of marble and very gloomy Illumination from
a

skylight above adds to the general air of expensive and

classical despair The floor is marble and there is a

gigantic mahogany table in the center of everything
Beyond

of

the room the safe from which a guard in a khaki uniform

with a revolver holster at his hip is extracting the

of Walter P Thatcher He brings it to Bertha as if he were

the guardian of a bullion shipment During this Bertha has

CHARLES FOSTER KANE

WHEN THESE LINES APPEAR IN PRINT FIFTY YEARS AFTER MY
DEATH

I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD WILL AGREE WITH MY
OPINION

OF CHARLES FOSTER KANE ASSUMING THAT HE IS NOT THEN
COMPLETELY

FORGOTTEN WHICH I REGARD AS EXTREMELY LIKELY A GOOD DEAL
OF

NONSENSE HAS APPEARED ABOUT MY FIRST MEETING WITH KANE WHEN

HE WAS SIX YEARS OLD THE FACTS ARE SIMPLE IN THE
WINTER

OF 1870

The camera has not held on the entire page It has been

following the words with the same action that the eye does

like

an animated cartoon) He is in the act of throwing a
snowball

INT PARLOR - MRS KANES BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

Camera is angling through the window but the window-frame

is
not cut into scene We see only the field of snow again
same
angle as in previous scene Charles is manufacturing
another
snowball Now -
Camera pulls back the frame of the window appearing and we
are inside the parlor of the boardinghouse Mrs Kane aged
about 28 is looking out towards her son Just as we take
her
in she speaks
MRS KANE
(calling out)
Be careful Charles
THATCHERS VOICE
Mrs Kane -
MRS KANE
(Calling out the
window almost on
top of this)
Pull your muffler around your neck
Charles -
But Charles deliriously happy in the snow is oblivious to
this and is running away Mrs Kane turns into camera and
we

see her face - a strong face worn and kind

THATCHERS VOICE
think well have to tell him now -

Camera now pulls back further showing Thatcher standing
before
a table on which is his stove-pipe hat and an imposing
multiplicity of official-looking documents He is 26 and

as
might be expected a very stuffy young man already very
expensive and conservative looking even in Colorado
MRS KANE
Ill sign those papers -
KANE SR
You people seem to forget that Im
the boys father
At the sound of Kane Srs voice both have turned to him
and
the camera pulls back still further taking him in
Kane Sr who is the assistant curator in a livery stable
has

been groomed as elegantly as is likely for this meeting ever
since daybreak

From outside the window can be heard faintly the wild and
cheerful cries of the boy blissfully cavorting in the snow

MRS KANE
Its going to be done exactly the
way Ive told Mr Thatcher -

KANE SR
If I want to I can go to court
father has a right to -

THATCHER
(annoyed)
Mr Kane the certificates that
Mr Graves left here are made out
to Mrs Kane in her name Hers
to do with as she pleases -

KANE SR
Well I dont hold with signing my
boy away to any bank as guardian
just because -

MRS KANE
(quietly)
I want you to stop all this
nonsense Jim

THATCHER
The Banks decision in all matters
concerning his education his place
of residence and similar subjects
will be final

(clears his throat)

KANE SR
The idea of a bank being the
guardian -

Mrs Kane has met his eye Her triumph over him finds
expression in his failure to finish his sentence

MRS KANE
(even more quietly)
I want you to stop all this
nonsense Jim

THATCHER
We will assume full management of
the Colorado Lode - of which you
Mrs Kane are the sole owner

Kane Sr opens his mouth once or twice as if to say
something
but chokes down his opinion

MRS KANE
(has been reading
past Thatchers
shoulder as he
talked)
Where do I sign Mr Thatcher

THATCHER
Right here Mrs Kane

KANE SR
(sulkily)
Dont say I didnt warn you

Mrs Kane lifts the quill pen

KANE SR
Mary Im asking you for the last
time - anyond think I hadnt been
a good husband and a -

a year is to be paid to yourself

and Mr Kane as long as you both
live and thereafter the survivor -

Mrs Kane puts pen to the paper and signs

KANE SR
Well lets hope its all for the
best

MRS KANE

It is Go on Mr Thatcher -
Mrs Kane listening to Thatcher of course has had her

ear bent in the direction of the boys voice Thatcher is
aware both of the boys voice which is counter to his own
and of Mrs Kanes divided attention As he pauses Kane

genteelly walks over to close the window

EXT MRS KANES BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -

Kane Jr seen from Kane Srs position at the window He
advancing on the snowman snowballs in his hands dropping
one knee the better to confound his adversary

KANE

He throws two snowballs missing widely and gets up and
advances another five feet before getting on his knees

KANE
The terms are underconditional

Union forever

Kane until his twenty-fifth
birthday at which time he is to

Mrs Kane rises and goes to the window

MRS KANE

Thatcher continues as she opens the window His voice as
before is heard with overtones of the boys

EXT KANES BOARDINGHOUSE - DAY -
Kane Jr seen from Mrs Kanes position at the window He

now within ten feet of the snowman with one snowball left
which he is holding back in his right hand

KANE
You cant lick Andy Jackson Old

He fires his snowball well wide of the mark and falls flat
his stomach starting to crawl carefully toward the snowman

THATCHERS VOICE

Sr ill at ease has no idea of how to comfort her

anxious to keep everything secret -

He stops as he realizes that Mrs Kane has paid no attention
bravely

to him and having opened the door is already well into the
hall that leads to the side door of the house He takes a

to look at him)

He reaches out for Charless hand Without a word Charles
hits him in the stomach with the sled Thatcher stumbles

back

THATCHER

You almost hurt me Charles
(moves towards him)
Sleds arent to hit people with

Hes near enough to try to put a hand on Kanes shoulder

cable

BERNSTEIN

The food is marvelous in Cuba the
senoritas are beautiful stop I
could send you prose poems of palm
trees and sunrises and tropical
colors blending in far off
landscapes but dont feel right in
spending your money for this stop
theres no war in Cuba regards
Wheeler

THATCHER

After

a moment of indecision he decides to make one last try

your - about the Enquirers campaign
against the Metropolitan Transfer
Company

KANE
Wont you step into my office Mr

have forgotten You are yourself

stockholders

Ive been saying in the Enquirer
about the traction trust absolutely

Theyre all part of your general
attack - your senseless attack -
on everything and everybody whos
got more than ten cents in his
pocket Theyre -

KANE
The trouble is Mr Thatcher you
dont realize youre talking to
two people

Kane moves around behind his desk Thatcher doesnt
understand
looks at him

KANE
As Charles Foster Kane who has
eighty-two thousand six hundred
and thirty-one shares of
Metropolitan Transfer - you see I
do have a rough idea of my holdings -
I sympathize with you Charles
Foster Kane is a dangerous
scoundrel his paper should be run
out of town and a committee should
be formed to boycott him You
may if you can form such a
committee put me down for a
contribution of one thousand

dollars
THATCHER
(angrily)
Charles my time is too valuable
for me -
KANE

On the other hand -

(his manner becomes

serious)
I am the publisher of the Enquirer
As such it is my duty - Ill let
you in on a little secret it is
also my pleasure - to see to it
that decent hard-working people
of this city are not robbed blind
by a group of money - mad pirates
because God help them they have
no one to look after their
interests Ill let you in on
another little secret Mr Thatcher
I think Im the man to do it You
see I have money and property -

Thatcher doesnt understand him

KANE
If I dont defend the interests of
the underprivileged somebody else
will - maybe somebody without any
money or any property and that
would be too bad

Thatcher glares at him unable to answer Kane starts to
dance

KANE
Do you know how to tap Mr
Thatcher You ought to learn -
(humming quietly
he continues to
dance)

Thatcher puts on his hat

THATCHER

I happened to see your consolidated
statement yesterday Charles
Could I not suggest to you that it
is unwise for you to continue this
philanthropic enterprise -

(sneeringly)
this Enquirer - that is costing
you one million dollars a year

KANE
Youre right We did lose a million
dollars last year

Thatcher thinks maybe the point has registered

KANE

We expect to lost a million next
year too You know Mr Thatcher -

quietly)
at the rate of a million a year -

There were a lot of them back in
the early days and -

Not some girl he knew casually and
then remembered after fifty years
on his death bed -

BERNSTEIN

Youre pretty young Mr -

(remembers the name)
Mr Thompson A fellow will
remember things you wouldnt think
hed remember You take me One
day back in 1896 I was crossing
over to Jersey on a ferry and as
we pulled out there was another
ferry pulling in -

(slowly)
- and on it there was a girl
waiting to get off A white dress
she had on - and she was carrying
a white pastrol - and I only saw
her for one second and she didnt
see me at all - but Ill beta

havent thought of that girl

of fellow you can fool every day
in the week - and twice on Sundays

Sometimes even I didnt get the
joke Like that night the opera
house of his opened in Chicago

Oh yes He saw to that I tell
you Mr Thompson he was a hard

too maybe he thought by finishing
that piece he could show Leland he
was an honest man You see Leland
didnt think so I guess he showed
him all right Hes a nice fellow
but hes a dreamer They were

INT CITY ROOM - ENQUIRER BUILDING - DAY -

The front half of the second floor constitutes one large
City

Room Despite the brilliant sunshine outside very little
of

it is actually getting into the room because the windows are

small and narrow There are about a dozen tables and desks

of the old-fashioned type not flat available for
reporters

Two tables on a raised platform at the end of the room

obviously serve the city room executives To the left of
the

platform is an open door which leads into the Sanctrum

As Kane and Leland enter the room an elderly stout gent on

the raised platform strikes a bell and the other eight

occupants of the room - all men - rise and face the new

arrivals Carter the elderly gent in formal clothes
rises

and starts toward them

CARTER
Welcome Mr Kane to the
Enquirer I am Herbert Carter

KANE
Thank you Mr Carter This is Mr
Leland
CARTER
(bowing)

How do you do Mr Leland

KANE
(pointing to the
standing reporters)
Are they standing for me

CARTER
I thought it would be a nice gesture
the new publisher -

KANE
(grinning)
Ask them to sit down

CARTER
You may resume your work gentlemen
(to Kane)
I didnt know your plans and so I
was unable to make any preparations

KANE
I dont my plans myself

They are following Carter to his raised platform

KANE
As a matter of fact I havent got
any Except to get out a newspaper

There is a terrific crash at the doorway They all turn to
see Bernstein sprawled at the entrance A roll of bedding

suitcase and two framed pictures were too much for him

KANE
Oh Mr Bernstein

Bernstein looks up

If you would come here a moment

The delivery wagon driver has now appeared in the entrance
with parts of the bedstead and other furniture He is

about

a bit bewildered

CARTER
(indicating open
door to left of
platform)
My little sanctum is at your
disposal But I dont think I
understand -

KANE
Im going to live right here
(reflectively)
As long as I have to

CARTER
But a morning newspaper Mr Kane
After all were practically closed
twelve hours a day - except for
the business offices -

must be changed Mr Carter The

Bernstein is writing down figures No one pays any

KANE

Im not criticizing Mr Carter
but heres what I mean Theres a
front page story in the Chronicle

(points to it)
and a picture - of a woman in
Brooklyn who is missing Probably
murdered

(looks to make sure

of the name)
A Mrs Harry Silverstone Why
didnt the Enquirer have that
this morning

CARTER
(stiffly)
Because were running a newspaper
Mr Kane not a scandal sheet

Kane has finished eating He pushes away his plates

KANE

Im still hungry Brad Lets go
to Rectors and get something
decent

(pointing to the

Chronicle before

him)
The Chronicle has a two-column
headline Mr Carter Why havent
we

CARTER
There is no news big enough

KANE
If the headline is big enough it
makes the new big enough The
murder of Mrs Harry Silverstone -

CARTER
(hotly)
As a matter of fact we sent a man
to the Silverstone home yesterday
afternoon

(triumphantly)
Our man even arrived before the
Chronicle reporter And theres
no proof that the woman was murdered -
or even that shes dead

KANE
(smiling a bit)
The Chronicle doesnt say shes
murdered Mr Carter It says the
neighbors are getting suspicious

CARTER
(stiffly)
Its not our function to report
the gossip of housewives If we

were interested in that kind of
thing Mr Kane we could fill the
paper twice over daily -

KANE

(gently)
Thats the kind of thing we are
going to be interested in from now
on Mr Carter Right now I wish
youd send your best man up to see
Mr Silverstone Have him tell
Mr Silverstone if he doesnt
produce his wife at once the
Enquirer will have him arrested

(he gets an idea)
Have him tell Mr Silverstone hes
a detective from the Central Office
If Mr Silverstone asks to see his
badge your man is to get indignant
and call Mr Silverstone an
anarchist

Loudly so that the neighbors can hear
CARTER
Really Mr Kane I cant see the
function of a respectable newspaper -

Kane isnt listening to him

KANE
Oh Mr Bernstein
Bernstein looks up from his figures

KANE
Ive just made a shocking discovery
The Enquirer is without a
telephone Have two installed at
once

BERNSTEIN
I ordered six already this morning
Got a discount

Kane looks at Leland with a fond nod of his head at
Bernstein
Leland grins back Mr Carter meantime has risen stiffly

CARTER
But Mr Kane -

KANE
Thatll be all today Mr Carter
Youve been most understanding
Good day Mr Carter

Carter with a look that runs just short of apoplexy leaves
the room closing the door behind him

LELAND
Poor Mr Carter

KANE
(shakes his head)
What makes those fellows think
that a newspaper is something rigid
something inflexible that people
are supposed to pay two cents for -

BERNSTEIN
(without looking up)
Three cents

KANE
(calmly)
Two cents

Bernstein lifts his head and looks at Kane Kane gazes back
at him

paper)

This is all figured at three cents

papers in his pocket)
All right but Ill keep these
figures too just in case

KANE
Ready for dinner Brad

BERNSTEIN
Mr Leland if Mr Kane he should
decide to drop the price to one
cent or maybe even he should make
up his mind to give the paper away
with a half-pound of tea - youll
just hold him until I get back
wont you

LELAND
Im not guaranteeing a thing Mr
Bernstein You people work too

fast for me Talk about new brooms

The Enquirer is not in competition

BERNSTEIN
We should be publishing such rags

Mr Kane I must ask you to see to
it that this - this person learns

to control his tongue

CARTER

Ive been a newspaperman my whole
life and I dont intend -

(he starts to sputter)
- if its your intention that I
should continue to be harassed by
this - this -

(hes really sore)
I warn you Mr Kane it would go
against my grain to desert you
when you need me so badly - but I
would feel obliged to ask that my
resignation be accepted

KANE
It is accepted Mr Carter with

assurances of my deepest regard

Kane sighs unperturbed as he reaches out his hand and
shoves

the forms off the table onto the floor where they scatter
into hundreds of bits

KANE
You can remake them now cant

Smathers mouth opens wider and wider Bradford and
Bernstein

EXT NEW YORK STREET - VERY EARLY DAWN -

The picture is mainly occupied by a large building on the
roof of which the lights spell out the word Enquirer

the sunrise We do not see the street or the first few

of this building the windows of which would be certainly
illuminated What we do see is the floor on which is

the City Room Over this scene newboys are heard selling
Chronicle their voices growing in volume

As the dissolve complete itself camera moves toward the one
lighted window - the window of the Sanctrum

INT KANES OFFICE - VERY EARLY DAWN -

The newsboys are still heard from the street below - fainter
but very insistent

Kanes office is gas-lit of course as is the rest of the
Enquirer building

Kane in his shirt sleeves stands at the open window
out The bed is already made up On it is seated
smoking the end of a cigar Leland is in a chair
NEWSBOYS VOICES
CHRONICLE CHRONICLE HYA - THE

Kane taking a deep breath of the morning air closes the

are very much fainter after this

Well be on the street soon Charlie -

watch)
Its three hours and fifty minutes
late - but we did it -

Leland rises from the chair stretching painfully

KANE
Tired

LELAND

KANE
A wasted day

BERNSTEIN
(looking up)
Wasted

LELAND
(incredulously)

BERNSTEIN
You just made the paper over four
times today Mr Kane Thats all -

KANE
Ive changed the front page a
little Mr Bernstein Thats not
enough - Theres something Ive
got to get into this paper besides
pictures and print - Ive got to
make the New York Enquirer as
important to New York as the gas
in that light

LELAND
(quietly)
Whatre you going to do Charlie

Kane looks at him for a minute with a queer smile of happy
concentration

KANE
My Declaration of Principles -
(he says it with
quotes around it)
Dont smile Brad -
(getting the idea)
Take dictation Mr Bernstein -

BERNSTEIN
Cant take shorthand Mr Kane -

KANE
Ill write it myself

Kane grabs a piece of rough paper and a grease crayon
Sitting
down on the bed next to Bernstein he starts to write

BERNSTEIN
(looking over his
shoulder)
You dont wanta make any promises
Mr Kane you dont wanta keep

KANE

(as he writes)
Thesell be kept

(stops for a minute

and reads what he

has written reading)
Ill provide the people of this
city with a daily paper that will
tell all the news honestly

(starts to write

again reading as

he writes)
will also provide them -

LELAND
Thats the second sentence youve
started with I

KANE

(looking up)
People are going to know whos
responsible And theyre going to
get the news - the true news -
quickly and simply and
entertainingly

(he speaks with

real conviction)
And no special interests will be
allowed to interfere with the truth
of that news
He looks at Leland for a minute and goes back to his

writing

reading as he writes

Bernstein has risen and crossed to one side of Kane They

both stand looking out Leland joins him on the other side

Their three heads are silhouetted against the sky lLelands

head is seen to turn slightly as he looks into Kanes face -

their

eyes have met although their faces are almost in
sillhouette

Front page of the Enquirer shows big boxed editorial with

heading

piles and go on back until we see a big field of Enquirers

there is tossed a bound bundle of the New York Enquirer -
the Declaration of Principles still prominent

Rural Delivery - a copy of the Enquirers being put into

The railroad platform again We stay here for four images
On each image the speed of the train is faster and the

of the Enquirer are larger On the first image we move
to hold on the words CIRCULATION - 31000 We are this
for the next pile which reads 40000 the next one which

55000 and the last which is 62000 In each instance the
bundles of newspapers are thicker and the speed of the

train behind the camera is increased

The entire montage above indicated is accompanied by a
descriptive complement of sound - the traffic noises of New
York in the 1890s wheels on cobblestones and horses
bicycle bells the mooning of cattle and the crowing of

Miss Townsend looks up and is so surprised to see Bernstein
with a stranger

MISS TOWNSEND
Good afternoon Mr Bernstein

BERNSTEIN
This is Mr Kane Miss Townsend

Miss Townsend cant stick to her plan She starts to rise
but her legs are none too good under her She knocks over a

tray of copy paper as she rises and bends to pick it up

KANE
to

(very hesitatingly
and very softly)
Miss Townsend -

At the sound of his voice she straightens up She is very

close to death from excitement

KANE
Ive been away for several months
and I dont know exactly how these
things are handled now But one
thing I wanted to be sure of is
that you wont treat this little
announcement any differently than
you would any other similar
announcement

He hands her an envelope She has difficulty in holding on

it

KANE
(gently)
Read it Miss Townsend And
remember - just the regular
treatment See you at nine oclock
Mr Bernstein

Kane leaves Bernstein looks after him then at the paper

Miss Townsend finally manages to open the envelope

A piece

of flimsy paper with a few written lines is her reward

MISS TOWNSEND
(reading)
Mr and Mrs Thomas Moore Norton
announce the engagement of their
daughter Emily Monroe Norton to
Mr Charles Foster Kane

BERNSTEIN
(starts to read it)
Mr and Mrs Thomas Moore Norton

MISS TOWNSEND

top of him)
Shes - shes the niece of - of
the President of the United States -

BERNSTEIN

a look

He takes her by the hand and leads her off

High angle downward - what Bernstein and Miss Townsend see
from the window
Kane is just stepping into an elegant barouch drawn up at
the
curb in which sits Miss Emily Norton He kisses her full
on
the lips before he sits down She acts a bit taken aback
because of the public nature of the scene but she isnt
really
annoyed As the barouche starts off she is looking at him
adoringly He however has turned his head and is looking
adoringly at the Enquirer He apparently sees Bernstein
and
Miss Townsed and waves his hand

Bernstein and Thompson As the dissolve comes Bernsteins
voice is heard

BERNSTEIN
The way things turned out I dont
need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton
was no rosebud

THOMPSON
It didnt end very well did it

BERNSTEIN

(shaking his head)
It ended -

(a slight pause)
Then there was Susie - that ended
too

(shrugs a pause

then looking up

into Thompsons

eyes)
guess he didnt make her very happy -

(A PAUSE)
You know I was thinking - that
Rosebud youre trying to find out
about -

THOMPSON
Yes -

BERNSTEIN

Maybe that was something he lost
Mr Kane was a man that lost -
almost everything he had -

(a pause)
You ought to talk to Bradford
Leland He could tell you a lot
I wish I could tell you where Leland
is but I dont know myself He
may be out of town somewhere - he
may be dead

THOMPSON
In case youd like to know Mr
Bernstein hes at the Huntington
Memorial Hospital on 180th Street

THOMPSON
Nothing particular the matter with
him they tell me Just -

BERNSTEIN

Just old age

EXT HOSPITAL ROOF - DAY -

Close shot - Thompson He is tilted back in a chair which
seems to be and is leaning against a chimney Lelands

is heard for a few moments before Leland is seen

LELANDS VOICE
When you get to my age young man
you dont miss anything Unless
maybe its a good drink of bourbon
Even that doesnt make much
difference if you remember there
hasnt been any good bourbon in
this country for twenty years

Camera has pulled back during above speech revealing that
Leland wrapped in a blanket is in a wheel chair talking

Thompson They are on the flat roof of a hospital Other
people in wheel chairs can be seen in the background along
with a nurse or two They are all sunning themselves

THOMPSON
Mr Leland you were -

LELAND
You dont happen to have a cigar
do you Ive got a young physician -
must remember to ask to see his
license - the odds are a hundred
to one he hasnt got one - who
thinks Im going to stop smoking
I changed the subject didnt I
Dear dear What a disagreeable
old man Ive become You want to
know what I think of Charlie Kane
Well - I suppose he has some private
sort of greatness But he kept it
to himself

(grinning)
He never - gave himself away - He
never gave anything away He just -
left you a tip He had a generous
mind I dont suppose anybody
ever had so many opinions That
was because he had the power to
express them and Charlie lived on
power and the excitement of using
it - But he didnt believe in
anything except Charlie Kane He
never had a conviction in his life
I guess he died without one -
That must have been pretty
unpleasant Of course a lot of
us check out with no special
conviction about death But we do
know what were leaving we
believe in something

(looks sharply at

Thompson)
Youre absolutely sure you havent
got a cigar

THOMPSON
Sorry Mr Leland

LELAND
Never mind - Bernstein told you
about the first days at the office
didnt he Well Charlie was a
bad newspaper man even then He
entertained his readers but he
never told them the truth

THOMPSON
Maybe you could remember something
that -

LELAND
I can remember everything Thats
my curse young man Its the
greatest curse thats ever been
inflicted on the human race Memory -
I was his oldest friend

(slowly)
As far as I was concerned he
behaved like swine Maybe I wasnt
his friend If I wasnt he never
had one Maybe I was what nowadays
you call a stooge -

KANES VOICE
Not one of you has been hired
because of his loyalty Its your
talent Im interested in That
talent thats going to make the
Enquirer the kind of paper I
want - the best newspaper in the
world
Applause During above Bernstein has come to Lelands
side

BERNSTEIN
Isnt it wonderful Such a party

LELAND
Yes

His tone causes Bernstein to look at him

KANES VOICE
However I think youll agree weve
heard enough about newspapers and
the newspaper business for one
night

The above speeches are heard under the following dialogue

BERNSTEIN
(to Leland)
Whats the matter

LELAND
Mr Bernstein these men who are
now with the Enquirer - who were

with the Chronicle until yesterday -
werent they just as devoted to

the Chronicle kind of paper as

they are now to - our kind of paper

BERNSTEIN
Sure Theyre like anybody else
They got work to do They do it
(proudly)
Only they happen to be the best
men in the business

KANE
(finishing his speech)
There are other subjects in the
world -

Kane whistles The band and the chorus girls enter and hell
breaks loose all around Leland and Bernstein

LELAND
(after a minute)
Do we stand for the same things
that the Chronicle stands for
Mr Bernstein

BERNSTEIN
(indignantly)
Certainly not So whats that got
to do with it Mr Kane hell
have them changed to his kind of
newspapermen in a week

LELAND
Probably Theres always a chance
of course that theyll change Mr
Kane - without his knowing it

Kane has come up to Leland and Bernstein He sits down next
to them lighting a cigarette

KANE
Well gentlemen are we going to

LELAND

war - with Benton Pulitzer and
Heart devoting twenty columns a

LELAND
They do it only because you do

KANE

And I do it because they do it

glaring

THE PRESIDENT
It is the unanimous opinion of my
Cabinent - in which I concur -
that the proposed leases are in
the best interests of the
Governement and the people

(pauses)

You are not I hope suggesting
that these interests are not

KANE
Im not suggesting anything Mr
President Ive come here to tell

you that unless some action is
taken promptly - and you are the
only one who can take it - the oil
that is the property of the people
of this country will be turned
over for a song to a gang of high-
pressure crooks

I must refuse to allow you to
continue in this vein Mr Kane

I understand that you have political
ambitions Unfortunately you

Yesterday morning you called the

think that crowd is doing down

Because the crackpot who did it
had a copy of the Enquirer in
his pocket

LELAND

said the President should be killed

I said treason was a capital offense
punishable by death -

genuinely kind)

First of all I will not write a

somebody paid a thousand dollars
for an advertisement in the

Thats just a little promotion
scheme Nobody expects you -

me go to Chicago

Why Brad

LELAND
I want to be transferred to the
new paper Youve been saying
yourself you wish you had somebody
to -
(he is heartsick
inarticulate)
Thats not what I wanted to talk
about

Kane goes around behind the desk and sits down

Kane looks at

KANE
Ill tell you what Ill do Brad -
Ill get drunk too - maybe thatll
help

LELAND
No that wont help Besides you
never get drunk I wanted to talk
about you and Emily

Leland sharply before he speaks

KANE
(quietly)
All right

LELAND
(without looking at
him)
Shes going to leave you -

KANE
I dont think so Brad Weve
just had word that the President
is out of danger
(ruefully)
It seems I didnt kill him after
all

LELAND
(takes his eye)
She was going to leave you anyway -

Kane takes this in

LELAND
Emilys going south next week with
the child As far as anybodys to
know its a holiday When they
get back -

KANE
(sharply)
Brad you are drunk

LELAND
Sure I am She wants full custody
of the child no matter what happens
If you wont agree to that shell
apply for a divorce regardless of
the Presidents wishes I cant
tell her shes wrong because she
isnt wrong -

KANE
Why is she leaving me

LELAND
(its very hard for
him to say all
this)
She hasnt any friends left sine
you started this oil business and
she never sees you

KANE
Do you think the Enquirer
shouldnt have campaigned against
the oil leases

LELAND
(hesitating)
You might have made the whole thing
less personal

No answer from Kane

LELAND
It isnt just that the President
was her uncle - everyone she knows
all the people shes been brought
up with everything shes ever
been taught to believe is important -

Still no answer from Kane

LELAND
Theres no reason why this - this
savage personal note -

KANE
The personal note is all there is
to it Its all there ever is to
it Its all there every is to
anything Stupidity in our
government complacency and self-
satisfaction and unwillingness to
believe that anything done by a
certain class of people can be
wrong - you cant fight those things
impersonally Theyre not
impersonal crimes against people
Theyre being done by actual persons -
with actual names and positions

and - the right of the American
people to own their own country is
not an academic issue Brad that
you debate - and then the judges
retire to return a verdict and the
winners give a dinner for the

losers
LELAND
You almost convince me
(rising)

Im just drunk enough to tell you
the truth I have to be a little
drunk for that because Im a coward
You know that Thats why you
keep me around

(smiles)
You only associate with your
inferiors Charlie I guess thats
why you ran away from Emily
Because you cant stand the company
of your equals You dont like to
admit they exist - the other big
people in your world are dead
I told you that

Kane looks at Leland but Leland cant be stopped now He
speaks very quietly - no poison in his voice - no personal
indignation - as though he were explaining the nature of a
disease

LELAND
You talk about the people of the
United States as though they
belonged to you When you find
out they dont think they are
youll lose interest You talk
about giving them their rights as
though you could make a present of
liberty Remember the working
man You used to defend him quite
a good deal Well hes turning
into something called organized
labor and you dont like that at
all And listen when your precious
underprivileged really get together -
thats going to add up to something
bigger than - than your privilege
and then I dont know what youll
do - sail away to a desert island
probably and lord it over the
monkeys

KANE
Are you finished

LELAND
Yes
(looking down)
Now will you let me go to Chicago

KANE

(with a little smile)
Youre not going to like it in
Chicago They wind comes howling
in from the lake And theres
practically no opera season at all -
and the Lord only knows whether
theyve ever heard of Lobster
Newburg -

LELAND

Thats all right

(he wont be charmed
out of his duty)

What are you going to do about
Emily

KANE
(his face hardning
a little)
Nothing - if she dosent love me -

Leland has risen He speaks as he turns away starting
towards
the door

LELAND

You want love on your own terms
dont you Charlie -

(he stops - his

back turned to

Kane)
Love according to your own rules
And if anything goes wrong and
youre hurt - then the game stops
and youve got to be soothed and
nursed no matter what else is
happening - and no matter who else
is hurt

KANE
Its simpler than that Brad A
society girl cant stand the gaff
thats all Other things are
important to her - social position
what theyre saying on the front
porches at Southampton is it going
to be embarrassing to meet somebody
or the other at dinner -

Leland has turned taking his eye again Now Kane stops and
smiles

KANE
She can leave me As a matter of
fact Ive already left her Dont
worry Brad - Ill live

LELAND
I know you will

KANE
(with all his charm)
Hey Brad Ive been analyzed an
awful lot tonight - lets have
another brandy

Leland shakes his head Kane lifts his glass

critic of our Chicago paper should

One of the most notable public
utterances ever made by a candidate
in this state -

KANE
Thank you gentlemen Thank you

He looks up and notices that the box in which Emily and the
boy were sitting is now empty He starts toward the rear of
the platform through the press of people Reilly approaches
him

REILLY
A wonderful speech Mr Kane

Kane pats him on the shoulder as he walks along

REILLY
I just got word from Buffalo Mr
Kane Theyre going to throw you
the organization vote - and take a
chance maybe youll give them a
break -

This is said almost inquiringly as if he were hoping that
Kane would give him some assurance that McDonald is not

a mistake There is no answer from Kane
REILLY
On an independent ticket theres
never been anything like it If

the election were held today youd
be elected by a hundred thousand
votes - and every day between now
and November 7th is just going to
add to your majority

Kane is very pleased He continues with Reilly slowly
through
the crowd - a band playing off Bernstein joins him

It does seem too good to be true
doesnt it Mr Bernstein

Rogers isnt even pretending He
isnt just scared anymore Hes

newspaper and if I didnt like the
way somebody else was doing things -
some politican say - Id fight
them with everything I had Only
I wouldnt show him in a convict
suit with stripes - so his children
could see the picture in the paper
Or his mother

himself from hurling

himself at Kane)

gentleman

EXT CORNER DRUG STORE AND STREET ON THE WEST SIDE OF NEW

NIGHT -

Susan aged twenty

the period is leaving the drug store
at night With a large

cheek she is

a recent rain

neatly but cheaply dressed in the style

Its about 8 oclock
man-sized handkerchief pressed to

in considerable pain The street is wet -

She walks a few steps towards the middle of the block and
Cloves

rubs

houses

almost

shoulder

glares

jaw

stand it no longer She stops opens a bottle of Oil of
that she has in her hand applies some to her finger and
her gums

She walks on the pain only a bit better Four or five
farther along she comes to what is clearly her own doorway

a shabby old four-story apartment house She turns toward
the doorway which is up a tiny stoop about three steps

As she does so Kane coming from the opposite direction
bumps into her and turns to his left to avoid her His

bumps hers and she turns As she does so Kane forced to
change his course steps on the loose end of a plank which
covers a puddle in the bad sidewalk The plank rises up and
cracks him on the knee also covering him with mud

KANE
(hopping up and
down and rubbing
his knee)
Ow

Susan taking her handkerchief from her jaw roars with
laughter

KANE
Its not funny

He bites his lip and rubs his knee again Susan tries to
control her laughter but not very successfully Kane

at her
SUSAN
Im sorry mister - but you do
look awful funny
Suddenly the pain returns and she claps her hand to her
SUSAN

Ow

KANE
Whats the matter with you
DISSOLVE

SUSAN
Toothache

KANE
Hmm

He has been rubbing his clothes with his handkerchief

SUSAN
Youve got some on your face

KANE
If these sidewalks were kept in
condition - instead of the money
going to some cheap grafter -

Susan starts to laugh again

KANE
Whats funny now

SUSAN
You are You look like youve
been making mud pies

In the middle of her smile the pain returns

SUSAN
Oh

KANE
Youre no Venus de Milo

SUSAN
(points to the
downstair window)
If you want to come in and wash
your face - I can get you some
hot water to get that dirt off
your trousers -

entitled to in 1910 for 500 a week including breakfast

There is a bed a couple of chairs a chiffonier and a few
personal belongings on the chiffonier These include a
photograph of a gent and lady obviously Susans parents

a few objets dart One At the Japanese Rolling Ball Game

(by way of
explanation)
My landlady prefers me to keep
this door open when I have a
gentleman caller
(starts to put the
basin down)
Shes a very decent woman
(making a face)
Ow

Kane rushes to take the basin from her putting it on the
chiffonier To do this he has to shove the photograph to

side of the basin Susan grabs the photograph as it is
to fall over

SUSAN
Hey you should be more careful
Thats my ma and pa

KANE
Im sorry They live here too

SUSAN
No Theyve passed on

Again she puts her hand to her jaw

KANE
Wheres the soap
SUSAN
In the water

Kane fishes the soap out of the water It is slippery
however

and slips out of his hand hitting him in the chest before
it

falls to the floor Susan laughs as he bends over

KANE
(starting to wash
his hands)
Youre very easily amused

SUSAN
I always like to see the funny
side of things No sense crying
when you dont have to And youre
so funny Looking at you I forget
all about my toothache

Her face distorts in pain again

SUSAN
Oh

KANE
I cant stay here all night chasing
your pain away

SUSAN
(laughs)
I know But you do look so silly

Kane with soaped hands has rubbed his face and now cannot
open his eyes for fear of getting soap in them

KANE
Wheres the towel

SUSAN
On the chiffonier Here

KANE
(cubs his face dry)
Thanks

SUSAN
(on her way to closet)
Ive got a brush in the closet
As soon as the mud on your trousers
is all dry - you just brush it
trying

KANE
Ill get these streets fixed if
its the last thing I do

Susan comes out of the closet She holds out the brush with
her left hand her right hand to her jaw in real distress

KANE
(takes the brush)
You are in pain arent you you
poor kid

Susan cant stand it anymore and sits down in a chair bent
over whimpering a bit

KANE
(brushing himself)
Wish there was something I could -

He stops and thinks Susan her face averted is still
hard not to cry

KANE
Ive got an idea young lady
(there is no response)
Turn around and look at me
(there is still no
response)
I said turn around and look at

Slowly Susan turns

It takes a second for Susan to adapt herself to this

before - the terrified and trembling Susan the apprehensive
principals the maids and singing teachers the stage hands
As the dissolve commences there is the sound of applause
(exactly as before) and now as the dissolve completes

the orchestra breaks frighteningly into opening chords of
music - the stage is cleared - Susan is left alone terribly
alone The curtain rises The glare of the footlights jump
into the image The curtain is now out of the picture and
Susan starts to sing Beyond her we see the prompters
containing the anxious face of the prompter Beyond that
in the darkness - an apprehensive conductor struggles with
task of coordinating an orchestra and an incompetent singer
Beyond that - dimly white shirt fronts and glistening bosoms
for a couple of rows and then deep and terrible darkness
Closeup of Kanes face - seated in the audience - listening
Sudden but perfectly correct lull in the music reveals a
from the audience - a few words from a sentence - the kind

thing that often happens in a theatre -

Music crashes in and drowns out the rest of the sentence
hundreds of people around the voice have heard it (as well
Kane) and there are titters which grow in volume

Closeup of Susans face - singing

Closeup of Kanes face - listening
There is the ghastly sound of three thousand people
applauding
as little as possible Kane still looks Then near the
camera there is the sound of about a dozen people

applauding

very very loudly Camera moves back revealing Bernstein
and

Reilly and other Kane stooges seated around him beating
their

palms together The curtain is falling - as we can see by
the

light which shutters down off their faces

The curtain is down - the lights glowing on it Still the

polite applause dying fast Nobody comes out for a bow

Closeup of Kane - breathing heavily Suddenly he starts to

applaud furiously

Susan appears for her bow She can hardly walk There is a

little polite crescendo of applause but it is sickly

RAYMOND
Yes sir - yes sir I knew how to

DISSOLVE
INT CORRIDOR AND TELEGRAPH OFFICE - XANADU - NIGHT -

Raymond walking rapidly along corridor He pushes open a
door

At a desk in a fairly elaborate telegraph office sits a
wireless

operator named Fred Near him at a telephone switchboard
sits

a female operator named Katherine (not that it matters)

RAYMOND

(reading)
Mr Charles Foster Kane announced
today that Mrs Charles Foster
Kane has left Xanadu his Florida
home under the terms of a peaceful
and friendly agreement with the
intention of filing suit for divorce
at an early date Mrs Kane said
that she does not intend to return
to the operatic career which she
gave up a few years after her
marriage at Mr Kanes request
Signed Charles Foster Kane

Fred finishes typing and then looks up

RAYMOND
Exclusive for immediate
transmission Urgent priority all
Kane papers

FRED
Okay

There is the sound of the buzzer on the switchboard
Katherine
puts in a plug and answers the call

KATHERINE
Yes yes Mrs Tinsdall -
Very well
(turns to Raymond)
Its the housekeeper

RAYMOND
Yes
KATHERINE
She says theres some sort of
disturbance up in Mrs Alexanders
room Shes afraid to go in

DISSOLVE

INT CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUSANS BEDROOM - XANADU - NIGHT -

The housekeeper Mrs Tinsdall and a couple of maids are
near

the door but are too afraid to be in front of it From
inside

can be heard a terrible banging and crashing Raymond
hurries

into scene opens the door and goes in

INT SUSANS BEDROOM - XANADU -

Kane in a truly terrible and absolutely silent rage is

literally breaking up the room - yanking pictures hooks and

all off the wall smashing them to bits - ugly gaudy
pictures -

Susies pictures in Susies bad taste Off of occasional

tables bureaus he sweeps Susies whorish accumulation of

bric-a-brac

Raymond stands in the doorway watching him Kane says
nothing

He continues with tremendous speed and surprising strength

still wordlessly tearing the room to bits The curtains
(too

frilly - overly pretty) are pulled off the windows in a
single

gesture and from the bookshelves he pulls down double
armloads

of cheap novels - discovers a half-empty bottle of liquor
and

dashes it across the room Finally he stops Susies cozy

little chamber is an incredible shambles all around him

He stands for a minute breathing heavily and his eye lights

on a hanging what-not in a corner which had escaped his
notice

Prominent on its center shelf is the little glass ball with

the snowstorm in it He yanks it down Something made of

china breaks but not the glass ball It bounces on the
carpet

and rolls to his feet the snow in a flurry His eye
follows

it He stoops to pick it up - cant make it Raymond picks
it up for him hands it to him Kane takes it sheepishly -
looks at it - moves painfully out of the room into the

corridor
INT CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUSANS BEDROOM - XANADU -
Kane comes out of the door Mrs Tinsdall has been joined
now
by a fairly sizable turnout of servants They move back
away
from Kane staring at him Raymond is in the doorway behind
Kane Kane looks at the glass ball
KANE
(without turning)
Close the door Raymond
RAYMOND
Yes sir
(he closes it)
KANE
Lock it - and keep it locked
Raymond locks the door and comes to his side There is a
long
pause - servants staring in silence Kane gives the glass
ball a gentle shake and starts another snowstorm
KANE
Raymond -
(he is almost ina
trance)
RAYMOND
Yes sir -
One of the younger servants giggles and is hushed up Kane
shakes the ball again Another flurry of snow He watches
the flakes settle - then looks up Finally taking in the
pack of servants and something of the situations he puts
the
glass ball in his coat pocket He speaks very quietly to
Raymond so quietly it only seems hes talking to himself
KANE
Keep it locked
He slowly walks off down the corridor the servants giving
way
to let him pass and watching him as he goes He is an old

old man

INT KANES CHAPEL - XANADU - LATE AFTERNOON -
As the dissolve completes itself camera is travellling

the floor of the chapel past the crypts of Kanes father and
mother - (marked James Kane - 18- TO 19- Mary Kane - 18-

19-) - past a blank crypt and then holding on the burial
Kanes son A group of ordinary workmen in ordinary clothes
are lowering a very expensive-looking coffin into its crypt
Kane stands nearby with Raymond looking on The men strain
and grunt as the coffin bangs on the stone floor The men
place over it a long marble slab on which is cut the words
CHARLES FOSTER KANE II
1907 - 1938
ONE OF THE WORKMEN
Sorry Mr Kane we wont be able
to cement it till tommorrow We -

Kane looks right through him Raymond cuts him short

RAYMOND
Okay

The men tip their hats and shuffle out of the chapel Kane
raises his head looks at the inscription on the wall It

a little to one side of Juniors grave directly over the
place which will be occupied by Kane himself

KANE
Do you like poetry Raymond

RAYMOND
Cant say Sir

KANE
Mrs Kane liked poetry -

Raymond is now convinced that the old master is very far

indeed - not to say off his trolley
RAYMOND
Yes Mr Kane

KANE
Not my wife - not either of them

He looks at the grave next to his sons - the grave marked
MARY KANE

RAYMOND
(catching on)
Oh yes sir

KANE
(looking back up at
the wall)
Do you know what that is

RAYMOND
(more his keeper
than his butler

now)
ts a wall you bought in China
Mr Kane

KANE
Persia It belonged to a king

RAYMOND
How did you get him to part with
it Mr Kane

KANE
He was dead Thats a poem Do
you know what it means

RAYMOND
No I dont Mr Kane

KANE
I didnt used to be afraid of it

A short pause His eyes still on the wall but looking
through
it Kane quotes the translation

KANE
The drunkeness of youth has passed
like a fever And yet I saw many
things Seeing my glory in the
days of my glory I thought my
power eternal And the days of my
life Fixed surely in the years But
a whisper came to me From Him who
dies not I called my tributary
kings together And those who were
proud rulers under me I opened
the boxes of my treasure to them
saying Take hills of gold
moutains of silver And give me
only one more day upon the earth
But they stood silent Looking
upon the ground So that I died
And Death came to sit upon my
throne O sons of men You see a
stranger upon the road You call
to him and he does not step He
is your life Walking towards time
Hurrying to meet the kings of India
and China
(quoting)
O sons of men You are caught in
the web of the world And the spider
Nothing waits behind it Where
are the men with towering hopes
They have changed places with owls
Owls who have lived in tombs And
now inhabit a palace

Kane still stares at the wall through it and way beyond
it
Raymond looks at him

of years anyway - but I knew how

to handle him

That

(rises)

Rosebud - that dont mean

anything I heard him say it

He just said Rosebud and then he
dropped that glass ball and it
broke on the floor He didnt say
anything about that so I knew he
was dead - He said all kind of
things I couldnt make out But I
knew how to take care of him

Thompson doesnt answer

RAYMOND

You can go on asking questions if
you want to

THOMPSON
(coldly)

Were leaving tonight As soon as

Not now I can remember

when theyd wait all day if
Mr Kane said so

Raymond ushes Thompson into

INT THE GREAT HALL - XANADU - NIGHT -

The magnificent tapestries candelabra etc are still
but now several large packing cases are piled against the

walls

some broken open some shut and a number of objects great
and

small are piled pell mell all over the place Furniture

statues paintings bric-a-brac - things of obviously
enormous

value are standing beside a kitchen stove an old rocking
chair

and other junk among which is also an old sled the self-
same

story Somewhere in the back one of the vast Gothic
windows

of the hall is open and a light wind blows through the
scene

rustling the papers

In the center of the hall a Photographer and his Assistant

are busy photographing the sundry objects The floor is

littered with burnt-out flash bulbs They continue their
work

throughout the early part of the scene so that now and then
a

flash bulb goes off In addition to the Photographer and
his

Assistant there are a Girl and Two Newspaperment - the
Second

and Third Men of the projection room scene - also Thompson
and

Raymond

The Girl and the Second Man who wears a hat are dancing

somewhere in the back of the hall to the music of a
phonograph

A flash bulb goes off The Photographer has just
photographed

a picture obviously of great value an Italian primitive
The Assistant consults a label on the back of it

ASSISTANT

The Third Newspaperman starts to jot this information down

ASSISTANT

their

equipment towards a large sculpture in another part of the

hall

regular crow

THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN

the palaces and the paintings and
the toys and everything - what
would it spell

Thompson has turned around He is facing the camera for the
first time

THOMPSON
Charles Foster Kane

Another flash bulb goes off The Photographer turns to

Thompson
with a grin
PHOTOGRAPHER

THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN

PHOTOGRAPHER

(to the Third
Newspaperman)

Jerry Did you ever find out what
it means Jerry
THOMPSON
No I didnt
The music has stopped The dancers have come over to
Thompson

SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN
Say what did you find out about
him anyway Jerry

THOMPSON
Not much

SECOND NEWSPAPERMAN
Well what have you been doing

THOMPSON
Playing with a jigsaw puzzle - I
talked to a lot of people who knew
him

GIRL
What do they say

THOMPSON
Well - its become a very clear
picture He was the most honest
man who ever lived with a streak
of crookedness a yard wide He
was a liberal and a reactionary
he was tolerant - Live and Let
Live - that was his motto But
he had no use for anybody who
disagreed with him on any point
no matter how small it was He
was a loving husband and a good
father - and both his wives left
him and his son got himself killed
about as shabbily as you can do
it He had a gift for friendship
such as few men have - he broke
his oldest friends heart like
youd throw away a cigarette
you were through with Outside of
that -

THIRD NEWSPAPERMAN
Okay okay

GIRL
What about Rosebud Dont you
think that explains anything

THOMPSON

No I dont Not much anway
Charles Foster Kane was a man who
got everything he wanted and then
lost it Maybe Rosebud was
something he couldnt get or lost
No I dont think it explains
anything I dont think any word
explains a mans life No - I
guess Rosebud is just a piece ina

He drops the jigsaw pieces back into the box looking at his
watch

THOMPSON
Wed better get along Well miss

the train

He picks up his overcoat - it has been resting on a little
sled - the little sled young Charles Foster Kane hit

with at the opening of the picture Camera doesnt close in
on this It just registers the sled as the newspaper

picking up their clothes and equipment move out of the

hall

INT CELLAR - XANADU - NIGHT -

A large furnace with an open door dominates the scene
laborers with shovels are shovelling things into the
Raymond is about ten feet away

RAYMOND
Throw that junk in too

Camera travels to the pile that he has indicated It is
bits of broken packing cases excelsior etc The sled is
top of the pile As camera comes close it shows the faded
rosebud and though the letters are faded unmistakably the
word ROSEBUD across it The laborer drops his shovel
the sled in his hand and throws it into the furnace The
start to devour it

EXT XANADU - NIGHT -

No lights are to be seen Smoke is coming from a chimney

Camera reverses the path it took at the beginning of the
picture perhaps omitting some of the stages It moves
fence

OUT

through the gates which close behind it As camera pauses
for a moment the letter K is prominent in the moonlight

Just before we fade out there comes again into the picture
the pattern of barbed wire and cyclone fencing On the

is a sign which reads
PRIVATE - NO TRESPASSING
