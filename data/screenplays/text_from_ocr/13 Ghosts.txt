THIRTEEN GHOSTS - Rev 102700

BLACKNESS SUPERIMPOSE The most beautiful thing we
can experience is the mysterious - Albert Einstein

Then I do believe in spooks I do believe in spooks
I do I do I do believe in spooks - The Cowardly Lion

TITLES

Abstract images begin to form They move beneath the
titles brilliant against the darkness the ghost-like
apparitions fighting a current as if caught in the
whirlwind of time

Our IMAGE SHARPENS The apparitions are no longer there
Instead police tape comes INTO FOCUS the seemingly
miles of it entangled on stacks of derelict cars that
fill the void The tape dances before us undulating to
a macabre rhythm floating on the nocturnal winds We
PAN

An auto wrecking yard at midnight Empty yet occupied

Light slowly INVADES the FRAME filling in the wrecking
yards cavernous shadows A distant ROAR announces
itself above the SOUNDTRACK the earth POUNDING CLAMOR
AMPLIFYING in with every second

As if searching for its source CAMERA PIVOTS AROUND
Instantly we find ourselves caught in the glare of
headlights and weve just enough time to make out the
semi truck before it plows through the yards chain link
gate shattering it like so much glass the truck heading
directly AT CAMERA running it over as if it werent
there

EXT AUTO GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

BOOMING UP and OVER the fence the yard is a veritable
maze of old rusted cars piled up helter skelter frozen
in time Broken glass mangled engine parts garbage and
litter along with hundreds of spent shell casings are

scattered in the dirt

A caravan of UTILITY VEHICLES ROARS in behind the semi
the convoy making a bead for the center of the yard

Picking up the rear is a black Rolls-Royce Phantom II
As they turn the last corner the first thing we see are
unearthly flares Dozens of them bright as hell

lighting up the middle of the graveyard

The CARS come SKIDDING to a stop Dust swirls

EXT ROLLS-ROYCE

The rear door opens and CYRUS KRITICOS 50s wealthy
immaculately dressed not a hair out of place steps out
His hand rests on a shiny silver-headed cane He
surveys the flares shakes his head

CYRUS
Their little crusade is wearing
thin

RAFKIN (0S)
Ill give them this they are
consistent

Stepping out next is DENNIS RAFKIN 20s unshaven
jittery He holds his head in his hands massaging his
temples obviously in pain

(NOTE Whenever we cut to Rafkin we hearsense a
piercing tone underscoring the psychic waves hes
receiving)

Cyrus produces a thin brown designer cigarette from a
silver case Taps it as he speaks

CYRUS
As cancer
(lights his cigarette)
Never bet against human nature
Dennis Youll always lose

Behind him Rafkin suddenly lurches forward racked by
spasms Cyrus turns with slight concern --

CYRUS
Is it bad tonight

RAFKIN
(coughing shaking)
Bad is one way of describing it
but somehow
(wiping his sweaty
forehead)
insane seems more appropriate

Rafkin doubles over in pain Dry heaves
RAFKIN
(recovering)
Its my professional opinion that
we get the hell out of here Now

Two of Cyruss team dressed in assault gear make their
way over

CYRUS
(ignoring Rafkin
re flares)
Noted Clean this place up and
locate our guests

Cyrus snaps his fingers An ASSISTANT steps forward
with a large photo

When Cyrus turns around he catches Rafkin gulping down
prescription drugs Cyrus strikes the bottle out of
Rafkins hand with his cane Pink medicine runs down
Rafkins face as he turns with rage

RAFKIN
Come on Cyrus I gotta take the
edge off

CYRUS

You know the routine First
things first Now where is he

Cyrus holds it in the limo headlights an aerial photo
of the graveyard Rafkin closing his eyes reaches
out towards the photo with one hand then touches the
earth with the other A silent moment

CYRUS
Where

Then a huge spark arcs between the psychic and the
ground Rafkin jolts back as if shocked

RAFKIN
Sweet Jesus Cyrus theres got to
be over forty victims here I
thought you said this guy killed
twenty people

CYRUS
Twenty when he was alive Hes
added a few more since then
Now wheres the Breaker Dennis

Rafkin ignores the photo and points at a spot deep
inside the auto graveyard Cyrus grabs a headset from
the Assistant

CYRUS
(into microphone)
All teams go to alpha I
repeat--

THIRTEEN GHOSTS - Rev 102700 4
EXT AUTO GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

Teams of men pile out of the vehicles The back of the
semi is opened revealing racks of remote-operated
amplifiers

Others unload inch-thick eight-foot-square sheets of
glass rimmed with aluminum pipe and inscribed with
ancient text

The glass sheets are assembled to form a large cube

Arrays of flood lamps illuminate the canyons of the
wrecking yard in stark white

One side of the cube remains open allowing entry
and -- ready to come down in theory and close the
improvised mousetrap

Rafkin walks up behind Cyrus still massaging his
temples

RAFKIN
Whered he get a name like the Breaker
anyway He a truck driver

CYRUS
Its simply folklore at work
The local color exorcising its
demons

Just then a hideous HOWL ECHOES through the night --
part human part God-knows-what Everyone stops

Rafkin swallows hard Tosses away the empty prescription
drugs bottle then opens an extra-large jar of aspirin
pops a few into his mouth crunches them like mints

CYRUS
Or maybe its because he broke
his victims into as many pieces as
possible
(exhaling smoke)
Whos to say

RAFKIN
Cute

A shrill cacophony of METAL AND GLASS erupts from the
maze of the graveyard A large dense object flies out
of the darkness and crashes down in front of them ina
cloud of dust

Its a crushed car Cyrus sighs

all they need to know

RAFKIN
But this is suicide
CYRUS
Then Ill match their price and

RAFKIN
You dont have that kind of money
CYRUS
Youd be surprised now get to

work

This takes Rafkin by surprise He turns taking a step
towards Cyrus Cyrus backs up his cane instantly at
Rafkins chest keeping him distant Rafkin becomes
suspicious

RAFKIN
What are you hiding old man

CYRUS
Careful Dennis curiosity killed
the cat

DAMON (0S)
Son-of-a-bitch

They both turn to see four team members dragging an
attractive man and woman DAMON QUINTEROS and KALINA
ORETZIA over to Cyrus Damons a handsome chap with
a righteous fire in his eyes Kalina his lover is
equally fiery late 20s tough and sexy She cradles
in her arms an ancient book

DAMON

CHANTING Spells being read over and over in Latin

Deep inside at the sound of the CHANTING there comes
another ungodly HOWL angrier than before

WITH TEAMS

Along the perimeter placing the amplifiers shock
instantly registers with the teams when they realize the
transmission has begun leaving them exposed

EXT TOP OF CAR PILE

Abruptly something reaches down and snatches a team
member up and OUT OF FRAME His partner glances back
sees his friend yanked up a wall of cars then into the
wreckage

EXT TOP OF CAR PILE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

An explosion of blood spatters from inside the broken
windshield A hand struggles against the glass A
friend dies a horrific death

EXT ACROSS FROM PILE OF CARS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

As HIDEOUS SCREAMS fill the air the Team Member turns
and starts climbing the other side Rafkin rounds a
turn sees the Team Member climbing up the wall of cars
The Team Member looks back as they approach

TEAM MEMBER 3
Run Its right behind me --

Suddenly a SQUEAL of METAL as something invisible
reaches through the grill of the car and grabs the Team
Member by the waist He screams as he is folded over
backwards and yanked into the grill of the car

Rafkin rushes toward him
We hear BONES BREAK as the Team Member screams

The Breaker unseen on the far side of the heap of cars
yanks on his victim over and over smashing the Team
Members chin against the grill trying to pull him
through

Rafkin does the best he can to pull the man free but it
seems hopeless The man screams and screams

Abruptly Rafkins efforts seem at last to work With
a mighty tug he tumbles back and falls to the ground
Looks down and sees that he holds only the mans foot

The wall of cars begins to move before Rafkin He leaps
just as the wall comes crashing down

Rafkin scrambles and runs full bore back the way he came
He looks back speaks into his mike

RAFKIN
Cyrus the spells arent working
Hes tearing this place apart

CYRUS (VO)
(on headset)
Calm down

RAFKIN
You calm down The son-of-a-bitch
is throwing cars at me

CYRUS (VO)
(on headset)
History has no time for cowards
Mr Rafkin

RAFKIN
Historys all were gonna be in
about two seconds

EXT AUTO GRAVEYARD - WITH RAFKIN 13

Rafkin turns a corner and runs past two team members
heading in the opposite direction

RAFKIN
Hey goddamnit youre running
the wrong way

They dont slow down

RAFKIN
(to himself)
Amateurs

Rafkin turns a corner and realizes why the team members
were running this way A car at the end of this alley is
tipped up on its bumper its undercarriage facing them
and is moving toward them fast

Rafkin and another team member deeper in the alley hear
the HOWL of the Breaker behind the floating car

RAFKIN
Jesus H Christ Run

Rafkin runs but the team member doesnt stunned by the
sight remains frozen Suddenly the car stops -- and
lifts straight up into the air over him

TEAM MEMBERS POV - THROUGH GHOST VISION GLASSES

The Breaker comes INTO CLEAR VIEW for a fraction of a
second Hes huge seven feet tall acromegalic the

bones beneath the skin swollen and distorted

( )

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

13

He stares with burning eyes above a huge distended jaw
He wears prosaically a filthy tattered garage uniform
his name stitched above the pocket His face chest
and arms are pockmarked with bullet holes dating from
his untimely death

He takes the car that he holds overhead and slams it
down The team member dodges out of the way but the
Breaker picks up the car again and slams it down again
squashing him And then again And then for good
measure once again

EXT AUTO GRAVEYARD - WITH RAFKIN 14

Rafkin tears down the alleyway He turns a corner just
as the wall behind him collapses

Hes looking down a passage filled with team members
with the cube serving as its plug a dead end It seems
the Breaker has everyone trapped instead of vice versa
Everyone runs toward the cube splashing through pools of
blood

BREAKERS POV

The team members and Rafkin scatter before us

Men climb up the walls of wreckage as the invisible
Breaker plows through sending men flying high into the
air Rafkin slams hard against the wall drops to the
ground

EXT GLASS CUBE 15
A team member runs looks over his shoulder at the
pursuing Breaker He doesnt see where hes going and

runs straight against a blood-splashed glass wall

Hes blundered into the glass cube In an instant the
Breakers inside with him

His entry trips an unseen switch The final glass wall
slides down sealing the cube As it does the howling
and the team members screams drop to silence

Inside the cube something awful happens but we cant
see through the smears of blood

Rafkin regains his senses scrambles towards the cube

RAFKIN
No Oh Christ no --

Inside the cube the Breaker turns realizes hes been
trapped launches himself at the bloody sheet of glass
presses his face to it howls

Rafkin recoils as the Breaker pounds at the glass With
each ghostly blow the symbol glows red but the

glass seems to have the power to contain the force it
holds

RAFKIN
Oh that piss you off does it
You know what pisses me off A
dead guy throwing Buicks at me

Rafkin eyes the horror then tugs off his glasses The
Breaker disappears

Rafkin collapses in exhaustion

RAFKIN
(into microphone)
I gotta hand it to you Cyrus the
bait worked You got your dozen
now Happy
(beat)
Cyrus

KALINA (0S)
(screaming desperate)
Help Somebody please Oh God

EXT AUTO GRAVEYARD - TANKER - MOMENTS LATER 16
Rafkin rounds a pile of cars and sees

Kalina on the ground holding a dying Damon in her arms
His throat has been slit and Kalina holds her hand over
the gash trying to keep him from dying

But its no use he dies Kalina sobs Rafkins in
awe perhaps ashamed

Rafkin turns nervously away And there he sees Cyruss
Assistant lying dead bloody and broken And beyond him
lies Cyrus himself

Cyruss neck has been pierced by a long metal shard His
eyes stare cold and dead Rafkin brings his hands to
his head distraught almost weepy

RAFKIN
Cyrus oh man look at you
There goes my bonus

Suddenly someone grabs his arm and spins him around
Its Kalina Shes sobbing and shaking Cyruss glasses
in Rafkins face

KALINA
Was it worth it Huh Playing
God Was it

OFF Rafkins shell-shocked look we PAN OVER to see the
ghost of one of the techs ripped apart and bloody
studying the scene

DISSOLVE TO

INT LARGE BEDROOM - MORNING 17
A bright sunny day

THROUGH a glass window we see and hear two children out
playing in the yard A Norman Rockwell picture-perfect
setting

A young boy and a teenage girl romp in the grass then up
to the window steps a beautiful woman fresh from the
garden Its obvious shes the mother of these two

Over the giggling of the kids she smiles at ARTHUR
KRITICOS 50 sitting inside his bedroom in a very
comfortable chair taking in his family with pride

We PAN TO Arthur as he smiles content

A sharp KNOCK on the bedroom door breaks the mood and
Arthur turns Our UNCUT CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN TO the
door As it does it SWEEPS ACROSS a desk decorated with
family photos one of which is the woman at the window

CAMERA CONTINUES TO the door where we notice the wall
and door around KATHY Arthurs 21-year-old daughter has
somehow aged from the pristine room we thought we were
in Kathy sticks her head in Pretty if she ever had
time to fix her hair clad in a University of Calumny
sweatshirt She stirs a pan of burnt scrambled eggs

KATHY
Dad its almost eight-thirty
shake a leg Youll miss your
first class And could you tell
Maggie to get the hell out of the
bathroom She had her five
minutes twenty minutes ago

17

The door slams shut again Our UNCUT CAMERA CONTINUES TO
PAN AROUND the room As it does the walls begin to age
drastically pictures disappearing books vanishing from
their shelves The room and all its promise simply slips
away By the time we GET TO the bed we notice only one
side is occupied The other lies fallow

Our UNCUT CAMERA RETURNS TO Arthur who sits unshaven
in a decrepit chair staring out at the brick wall lying
just outside the window not ten feet from him Gone is
the world he knew the beauty of a home the sounds of a
family laughing in the summertime heat They are
replaced by the angry cacophony of the inner city
streets its claustrophobic conditions its hopeless
yoke

Our CAMERA CONTINUES PAST Arthur RETURNING TO the desk
All are gone save one the picture of his wife which
sits charred and frameless propped up against a stack of
bills

INT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 18

Arthur comes out of the bathroom and beholds in the
kitchenette of his small cramped three-bedroom
apartment

A blur of activity Kathy cooks at the stove his son
BOBBY 7 eats a bowl of cereal at the kitchen table
while scanning the obituary section of the newspaper He
records the different humorous deaths with a microphone
and a tape recorder

In the bg on the TELEVISION a black and white horror
movie drones on (the original Thirteen Ghosts)

The nanny MAGGIE 26 just gets in the way wiping the
counter pouring the OJ setting the table Its a very
disorganized way of doing things

Shes trying sort of but we can see from Kathys body
language that shes at her wits end with the woman

BOBBY
Today on Death in Manhattan This
Morning we notice a small leap
in heart attacks in the city
cancer deaths are down And we
have a special treat for
everyone-- a body was found this

Kathy makes a gagging response while scooping eggs onto
the first of three places on the counter He looks at
the eggs burned in effigy but continues smiling

BOBBY
Dad will you tell Kathy that
keeping a record of deaths is
healthy because its in the
interest of science

ARTHUR

ARTHUR
Oh my God

EXT HOUSE

An enormous and majestic house made of glass nestled
amongst pine trees Stark against the evening sky the
house is awe-inspiring

Even for an English teacher Arthur has a hard time
finding the words

Theres also a Power and Light truck parked in front

EXT HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

The group approaches the front door It looks unusual
yes but its also an undeniable architectural marvel

BEN
Thats strange

A young man appears waiting in the solitary light of the
porch a clipboard in his hand and a tool belt slung over
his shoulder Hes dressed in a Power and Light uniform
and ON CLOSER INSPECTION we see that its Rafkin in
disguise He approaches the family

RAFKIN
Bout time someone got here You
the owners

BEN
Whore you

RAFKIN
The power guy I dont know if
youre aware of it but this place
keeps knocking out the power in the
tri-quad area So if you dont

RAFKIN
Quite a place you got here

KATHY

ARTHUR
One step at a time

EXT HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - MOMENTS LATER 24

Outside the main structure is an entryway with an inner
and outer door almost like an airlock Arthur produces
the odd key and slips it into the keyhole The locking
mechanism visible within the glass beckons

Arthur turns the key As it turns we hear the MECHANISM
CLICK and WHIR Then oddly the key is sucked into the
keyhole and vanishes

Everyone looks at the now-empty keyhole then at each
other then back at the keyhole

Bobby reluctantly clicks off the recorder

INT CLOCKWORK ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 25

In the basement of the house in a dark space we see a
tiny pendulum within a delicate antique set of gears
come to life AS we PULL AWAY runes of odd description
come INTO VIEW etched on ivory plates the plates
attached to levers and meters standing poised waiting

The lights in the room suddenly flicker on

We PULL AWAY FROM the odd bits of machinery seeing it
for what it is a control panel of some kind Our
RETREATING CAMERA then becomes engulfed by what looks to
be a huge set of gears made of brass and steel standing
by We PULL OUT the other side of the gears viewing the
machinerys massive size the gears works nearly fifteen
feet high dominating a room filled with pulleys and
steel cable

Lights flicker on from within the house allowing us to
see inside The most striking thing about it is that the
house is entirely transparent Even the interior walls
are made of glass putting the furniture fixtures and
all the expensive-looking antique decorations on stark
display Everyone stares at the alarming edifice
fascinated

BOBBY
How Weird

ARTHUR
Apparently Cyrus wasnt too keen
on privacy

KATHY

Arthur pushes the door open and they enter

INT MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION 27

The group comes into the entryway Like an airlock the
outer door closes before the inner one will open

MAGGIE
I did mention I dont do windows

The walls of the entryway are lined with rare ancient
documents in exquisite cases archeological treasures
recognizably priceless antiques The group looks
around amazed

With fascination Arthur studies the text on the walls
ARTHUR
(under his breath)

KATHY

a fortune

Yeah That occurred to me

With a huge smile Bobby reaches for an ancient samurai
sword on display Arthur catches him in mid act

They come to a great hall a soaring open space with a
large stained glass ceiling and strangely an equally
large brass and copper floor With only one other door
at its opposite end the room is a great glass cube

RAFKIN
(under his breath)
Ohhh Cyrus What did you do

ARTHUR
Okay First rule No throwing
stones

BEN

Its marvelous isnt it A
living work of art

A few chuckles But Rafkin looks troubled Sweat
beads on his forehead His head is killing him and
hes rubbing incessantly on his temples

RAFKIN
(to Ben)
Excuse me the sooner you show me
where you hid the basement the
sooner Im outta here --

BEN
I believe its down the hall
second door on the right

Rafkin walks off holding his head leaving the others
still examining the house

Bobbys eye catches on the design in the floor made of a
series of concentric metal rings Theres a brass disk
in the center two feet in diameter with symbols etched
into its surface spinning slowly

Bobby goes to place his foot on it when Arthur lifts him
up

ARTHUR
Dont touch anything At least
until we got some property
insurance

He places Bobby down beside Kathy and Maggie

BEN

sign in the library After that

walk off

After a beat Kathy Maggie and Bobby slip away

INT BASEMENT 28

Rafkin descends the stairs Downstairs is a maze of
narrow glass corridors Not much else Its all very
clean and sterile Not a spider web in the joint In
fact theres nothing alive down here

Rafkin removes a pair of ghost glasses Slips them on

An AUDIO PIERCING GAINS in VOLUME with every step Rafkin
takes

THROUGH GHOST GLASSES
RAFKIN
Alright you sick bastard whered
you put my money

As soon as Rafkin reaches the bottom step hes assaulted
full force by the psychic waves around him

RAFKIN
Aaahh

( )

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

28
He keels over and vomits
The assault becomes too much he collapses against a wall
When he doubles over in pain we reveal a ghost behind
him in the glass Its a teenager from the 50s a high-
schooler in a lettermans coat the victim of a horrific
auto crash He holds a baseball bat menacingly over his
shoulder
Rafkin sensing its proximity turns as the ghost swings
the bat with all his might Instinctively Rafkin leaps
back but the glass holding the ghost holds With
exception of the red symbols that EXPLODE across its
surface the barrier remains intact
But the ghost within is suddenly gone
Rafkin lands with fright a few feet back up the hallway

RAFKIN
Sweet Jesus not you

As he turns about him another ghost launches out of the
darkness at him only to be stopped by the glass Its
an older Pilgrimess woman in stocks

Rafkins jolted by this vision Hes driven to the other
side of the hallway Again when he turns around the
ghost is gone He turns to face the Fat Man and the
Little Woman ghosts

This sends him flying

Rafkin races back down the corridor in shock Soon hes
lost in the underground maze of glass confused by all
the twists and turns

He finally reaches the foot of the stairs

And bolts up them

runny mascara stains cascading down her bloodless cheeks
She launches herself against the glass clawing and

Backing right into an open doorway

As he steps over the threshold theres a flicker of
light in the doorway and a sharp SNICK

Ben stands in the doorway surprised apparently
paralyzed His glasses tumble off his face stems sliced
through The briefcase in his hand also seems to be
sliced Half of it falls and halves of dollar bills
spill out onto the floor

Ben slowly slides to the ground Or at least his front
half does The glass door has snapped shut like a razor
blade Bisecting him laterally slicing straight through
his body

smiles and vanishes

Still lost in her personal nirvana Kathy nonchalantly
strolls over to the bathtub drawing back its
bloodstained curtain In a TIGHT SHOT she runs the
water which is blood-red On the CUT she brings it up
to her face where its warm clear and perfect

When she leans back a bit we see the naked female
suicide ghost lying in the bloody tub wrists slashed
eyes staring at Kathy wickedly

Kathy doesnt see her because shes not wearing the
glasses

Two words are written in blood on the glass walls
surrounding the tub

Bobby grabs his glasses again and when he slips them
on—-

THROUGH GHOST GLASSES

He sees a decapitated head lying on the floor right
between his legs wrapped in plastic The heads eyes
snap open and it begins to mouth words

Bobby screams then he hears a DRAGGING sound behind
him like dead skin slapping on glass

Bobby turns and sees a headless legless human torso
wrapped in sheets of filthy plastic crab-walking towards
him

BOBBY
Daaddd

Bobby jumps to his feet turning He runs down the hall
Looks back sees nothing then when he turns back
straight into the bound woman

Pinned against the glass the bound woman lets out a
muffled cry

Strangled by a businessmans tie which is still cinched
tight around her neck her tongue sticks out like a thick
blue thumb Her hair skin and prom dress are clotted
with dirt and worms -- the marks of a shallow grave Her
hands and feet are bound by rope but thats not the
worst Her head sits askew on her shoulders neck
obviously broken a chunk of bone jutting out just
beneath the skin

Panicked she goes into violent convulsions

Its too much for Bobby He turns and bolts racing
blindly through the basements glass hallways When
finally he feels safe he slows enough to look over his
shoulder and thats when he slams into a wall of glass

The collision knocks his glasses from his head his mike
from his shoulder He reaches for his glasses when the
tiny sound of a SQUEAKING WHEEL issues FROM his MIKE
down the hall

Bobby looks at the mike then fearfully back at the
glasses in his hands Ushering all his courage Bobby
dons the glasses and with his heart beating like a
hummingbirds he turns around and sees

Another WOMAN there walking down the corridor towards
him Dressed in only a hospital gown she wheels a
portable IV stand along the floor Yards of thin plastic
IV tubes tether her to the stand Her arms thin
withered from long illness bear nasty scars from
unnumbered operations Her head is almost completely
covered in stained bandages but a beauty mark decorates
that portion of her face we can see

She gropes blindly down the passage straight towards
Bobby

He backs up trips over his feet almost falls
The IV Woman stops So does Bobby

Bobby waits frozen He tries to call for help but can
only manage a gasp

BOBBY

The IV Woman seems to respond to the sound of his voice

She cocks her head as if listening She moves calling

out but we hear it THROUGH the tiny amplifier of Bobbys

JEAN (VO)

B-bb-bobby
And now he recognizes her voice -- its his mother Jean

Thats it Bobby turns and runs like hell Around the
corner and right into --

Cyrus Or Cyruss ghost Pale white with eyes rolled
back and a big spike sticking out of his neck Standing
behind a pane of glass Bobby actually hit glass and he
catches a glimpse of the dead Cyrus just before hes
knocked out from the impact

Suddenly a glass block in the floor behind them pops

It lands on the floor illuminating the corridor
The ghostly figures quickly disperse

flying over the couch

ARTHUR
Son of a bitch

KALINA
There is a way to save her
Arthur And your kids too

Arthur stops pacing Turns to her --

KALINA

This house it isnt a house
its a machine Its a complete
recreation of Basileus design

(reading from the

book )
According to this there should
only be twelve earthbound spirits
trapped inside here

Arthur walks over and she shows him the book

KALINA

(re book)
You see these Theyre the Black
Zodiac They represent the
different ghosts that Cyrus needed
to catch

(reading)
The Withered Lover the First Born
Son the Torn Prince And here
the Bound Lady the Great Child
and the Dire Mother the Suicide
the Torso and the Buried Maiden
then theres the three death signs
the sign of Hells Winter the
Hammer the Hyena and the
Juggernaut

As Kalina counts through the ghosts of Arthur forever
the math teacher instinctively counts them off on his
fingers Kalina flips through a few more pages

KALINA
According to Basileus this
machine requires the energy of
these specific spirits in order
to bring it to life Once
engaged the spirits are freed one
by one each adding its energy to
the machine powering it up

Hell

MAGGIE
The Eye of Hell

RAFKIN

I saw a man carrying his own head
The Eye of Hell isnt a stretch

ARTHUR
Go on

KALINA
In Hell theres an eye that sees
the whole world Past and future

the damned If knowledge is
power then the man who controls
the Ocularis would be the most
powerful man on earth Your
uncle was planning to become God

Uh-uh Uh-uh What about this
thirteenth ghost Even Damon
mentioned it

KALINA
Its a fail safe Yes In order
to stop the process The house
needs a sacrifice of life instead
of death
(beat)

A willing human sacrifice
The sacrifice of the Broken Heart

All eyes turn on Arthur

RAFKIN
the thirteenth ghost

KALINA
Exactly The thirteenth spirit
stands before the eye as the final
configuration culminates As the
eye opens the spirit uses the
power of life to essentially
short circuit the system

ARTHUR
Uses the power of life
Kalina swallows hard
KALINA
By leaping into the eye
ARTHUR
Thanks for painting the picture
RAFKIN

Kalinas following the manual She studies the different
levers and what each does

Maggie turns and comes face-to-face with Cyruss ghost

her surprise he doesnt react

Instead he takes a step towards her She tries to ward
him off again with the flare but he takes another
step

MAGGIE
Damn Kalina you better get

Maggies panicking and then her flare starts to go

out
MAGGIE
Hurry your ass up
Maggie backs up and shes hit over the head from
behind She lands on the floor and goes out like a
light

Cyruss ghost approaches the body And so does Kalina
The faint flare illuminates both of them

In Kalinas hand we see the Arcanum Its obvious she
just struck Maggie with it

Kalina removes her glasses and looks over at Cyruss
ghost Hes still there hasnt vanished

They embrace and kiss

And then the flare completely goes out plunging the room

86B

Hed never be able to live with himself This is his
chance to redeem himself for Jean

ARTHUR
Its the only way Im sorry
Take care of each other

Arthur takes a long look around at the macabre scene
before him First to the ghosts that circle the Eye
each still trapped in his or her own hell Then Arthur
focuses on the blades that swirl around him threatening
to dice his family all that he loves Then Arthur looks
down into the fiery mechanical purgatory that is the Eye
of Hell its gigantic GEARS GRINDING away the steel
bathed in crimson light driving the housemachine toward
its fantastic culmination

Finally to the symbols on the outer ring that flash by at
Arthurs feet

The whole effect does something to Arthur Especially the
mesmerizing symbols flying by We suddenly INTERCUT WITH
FLASHBACK - PAGES OF ARCANUM

flipping by in the library in FLASHBACK as Kalina was
explaining the ghosts

KALINA
(in FLASHBACK)
According to this there should

only be twelve earthbound spirits
trapped inside here

CUT BACK TO

ARTHURS HAND

doing something a math teacher does naturally -- counting
off with his fingers

The symbols float by in Arthurs gaze in SLOW MOTION
We --
CUT BACK TO

Arthur flashes back to the library one final time This

THIRTEEN GHOSTS - Rev 11100 96

Cyrus realizes hes been made Arthur runs over and
grabs his uncle throwing him into the wall Arthur
throws a punch landing a hard right on Cyrus

ARTHUR
Stop the machine

Arthur punches Cyrus again And again Cyrus stumbles
backwards regains himself smiles then goes after
Arthur

CYRUS
Well well its nice to see
you have some of the family blood
in you after all

The two men go at it

Arthurs fighting for his life Hes like a wild man
throwing everything hes got hitting Cyrus everywhere
In the face the body

ARTHUR
You took away everything I loved
you monster Everything
(with every blow)
Now I Want It Back

But Arthur has never been a warrior Cyrus spotting his
opportunity retaliates Cyrus connects with Arthur in
the face knocking him down Then he kicks Arthur in the
gut a few times making sure he stays down

CYRUS
How dare you stand in the way of
history Arthur You are nothing
you hear me Nothing I
dedicated my entire life to this
Every goddamn day When have you
ever shown that kind of dedication
Huh To anything

He kicks Arthur repeatedly like a sick mind kicking a
dog to death

CYRUS
You make me sick

She notices Kalinas bloody squashed remains in the
glass beyond

MAGGIE
(reacting to Kalina)
Jesus
(rubbing her head)
Man what is that noise

Then she notices the reel-to-reel machine on the table
Maggie reaches the machine and looks for an off switch
Cant find one The CHANTING sound is unbearable

She finally shoves the MACHINE off the table and it goes

CRASHING to the floor

INT GREAT HALL
Arthur regains himself when Cyrus appears over him

CYRUS

(out of breath)
The world hasnt time for small
people Arthur People like you
or Dennis Or Kalina It needs
those who are willing to do
anything without question for
what they believe in

ARTHUR
You sonofabitch

Arthur rises to attack but Cyrus stops him with a steel
sword he pulls from his cane He points the blade
beneath Arthurs chin Arthurs eyes dart around
searching for a last way out Cyrus spots Arthur
thinking

CYRUS
Im sorry Arthur Unlike Jean
you havent got a choice this
time Now make the sacrifice Or
your Children Will Die

The CHANTING sound suddenly ENDS Silence

Cyrus looks around in shock and confusion As does
Arthur

Thats when he sees Bobbys scooter come rolling behind
Cyrus from the other side of the corridor

THIRTEEN GHOSTS - Rev 11100 98

Arthur quickly seizes the moment and kicks Cyruss legs
throwing him off balance and stumbling backward right
into the path of the scooter

Like a banana peel Cyrus slips on it and lands on his
ass

Arthur scoops up the cane as Cyrus struggles to get
back to his feet

When Cyrus turns back around Arthur cracks him across
the chest with the cane sending Cyrus sailing down

the hall He lands at the opening of the Great Hall

stunned by what just happened

He glances back at the scooter then over to where it
came Nothing He slips on his glasses for a moment
and there standing casually in the corridor is the ghost
of Dennis Rafkin

RAFKIN
never bet against human
nature Arthur Youll always
lose
Arthur smiles in thanks

CUT TO

CYRUS

just as he comes to on the floor He looks up and
theres nothing there Arthur puts on his glasses and
sees 12 very deadly ghosts standing around Cyrus The
ghosts of the house reach down and grab Cyrus --

CYRUS
Get away No

Arthur watches as the ghosts tear into Cyrus Its a
feeding frenzy The last one in to tear in is the
Breaker Cyrus suffers a horrible ending
CYRUS
