FADE IN
INT VAUDEVILLE THEATER - NIGHT

A black signboard at the edge of the stage reads ETON AND FARRELL
in white Art Deco type A piano plays The voice of RUTH ETON
begins warbling the verse of If I Could Be With You (One Hour
To-Night) a pop tune by Henry Creamer and Jimmy Johnson

We PAN from the signboard across the stage past Ruths studly
accompanist EDDIE FARRELL and HOLD ON Ruth a sad-eyed jazz
singer in a sexy black dress who stands in front of the grand
piano a scarf in her hand

RUTH

(sings)
Im so blue I dont know what to do
All day through Im pining just for you
I did wrong when I let you go away
And now I grieve about you night and day
Im unhappy and dissatisfied
But Id be happy if I had you by my side

As Ruth begins the refrain an unseen orchestra joins in

RUTH
(sings)
If I could be with you Id love you strong
If I could be with you Id love you long

I want you to know that I wouldnt go
Until I told you honey that I loved you so

Eddie sings the second half of the refrain not nearly as well as
Ruth

EDDIE
(sings)
If I was free to do the things with you
If I could do the things I know Id do

Im telling you true
Id be anything but blue
If I could be with you

Ruth takes the second refrain in a faster rhythmically complex
tempo

RUTH
(sings)
If I could be with you Id love you strong
If I could be with you Id love you long

I want you to know that I wouldnt go
Until I told you honey that I loved you so

If I could be with you one hour tonight
If I was free to do the things I might
Im telling you

H

£ I could be with you

H

For just one hour

If I could be with you

Ruth bows to the audience as they APPLAUD She gestures to Eddie

A full house The orchestra leader conducts the rousing FANFARE

The music stops as the shows tuxedoed MASTER OF CEREMONIES walks
onstage

THE MC
Ladies and gentlemen We have waited as
long as possible I regret very much to
announce that all the stars to appear
none have shown up Your money will be
refunded at the box office However
before you go I wish to state that we
have with us tonight a very unexpected
guest performer A girl none of us can
forget Eddie Farrells old partner Miss
Ruth Eton

The audience APPLAUDS

THE MC
Thank you

The MC turns and beckons to Ruth offstage

THE MC
Oh Ruthie
(to the audience)
Miss Eton

MUSIC begins lights go down the MC retreats

Ruth dressed in ordinary street clothes walks to center stage
her head down her purse and gloves in her hand She pauses looks
out at the audience sadly and sings the verse and one refrain
of the torch song Dont Tell Him What Happened To Me (by BG

De Sylva Lew Brown and Ray Henderson) in one long glorious take
CUT TO
throat

RESUME

RUTH

(sings)
I loved him I lost him
He craved a thrill
I cant forget him
I love him still
Its over all over
And yet I find
That hes always on my mind

Tell me where he is tell me where he goes
Tell me what he does tell me who he knows
But dont tell him what happened to me

If he says his life now is like a song
Tell him he was right tell him I was wrong
But dont tell him what happened to me

Let him remember me

As I used to be

When his love for me
Made me strong and free

Ask him if the new kisses are divine
Ask him if they thrill just as much as mine
But dont tell him what happened to me

EDDIE watching from the wings He clutches his laryngitic
and expresses guilt and remorse

ON RUTH as she sings another half refrain of the song

RUTH
(sings clutches her purse)
Let him remember me
As I used to be
When his love for me
Made me strong and free

I wonder if the new kisses are divine
I wonder if they thrill just as much as mine
Oh dont tell him what happened to me

The MUSIC ends Ruth head bowed walks off The audience APPLAUDS
and rises -- whether to begin a standing ovation or to go home is
not entirely clear

CUT TO

IRISHMAN in overalls sweeps the floor with a broom as an
emotionally-drained Ruth walks past

Good night

The Irishman walks off as Eddie hat in hand emerges from some
curtains and steps in Ruths path She pauses looks up and
recognizes him

RUTH
Oh

EDDIE
Yes its me

They stand alone in the darkened backstage with the one lamp
glowing between them

RUTH
Hello Eddie

EDDIE

(genuinely)
Yes I had to see you As much as you must
hate me for the way Ive treated you But
I got what was coming to me And I see
now that I deserved it Those fair-weather
friends of mine certainly put the skids
under me plenty Just think of it Not one
of them showed up Gee Ruth you were

Ruth cant meet his eye

EDDIE
