FADE IN on MARIA (late 20s) asleep in bed Shes

breathtakingly beautiful Morning light fills the room
The

sound of wind and rippling cloth

Maria stirs and opens her eyes She stretches
contentedly

Then she frowns Rolls over Shes alone in the
bed

No shes not PETER (20s) sits on the edge his back to
her

Two fresh steaming mugs of coffee sit on a tray near
him

MARIA

towards an OPEN WINDOW

Theres something strange about the way he moves --

MARIA
Peter Whats the matter
He pauses at the window Turns his head to look back
His eyes are vacant His face is a blank
Then Peter slowly leans forward And falls from the

Maria stands in shock as the sound of SCREECHING TIRES

outside reaches her ears Then SCREAMS OF TERROR from

Aghast she finally manages to numbly walk forward

the window We MOVE PAST her and TILT DOWN TO REVEAL --
-- PETERS BODY lies in the middle of the street

has burst open his body broken and twisted

ON THE PAVEMENT a line of blood appears moving down

A translation appears over them The Grudge

She turns to see her boyfriend DOUG (20s American)
approaching With a reassuring smile he takes her hand
-- and together they force their way through the
trying to escape the flow Theyre jostled and crushed
the crowd and Doug protectively pulls Karen closer

KAREN
Ill never get used to this

DOUG
Maybe we should find a different
train station
He abruptly stops right in the middle of traffic
holding Karens hand She turns wondering whats going
She sees the smile on his lips a moment before --

-- he sweeps Karen into his arms and kisses her As if

crowd of businessmen surging around them isnt there at

Its tender and loving and she responds at first
then she pulls away shy
KAREN
A public display of affection is
considered rude in Japan

Theres an opening ahead into a SIDE STREET Doug and

deftly slip out of the traffic --

from the crowded thoroughfare

Doug smiles as they pass by two JAPANESE HIGH SCHOOL
making out on the street corner He turns to give Karen
sarcastic look --

the other direction at a trickle of SMOKE wafting up over a
nearby fence

KAREN
Whats that

Doug follows as she walks toward an OLD TEMPLE nestled
beneath a skyscraper A collision of the ancient and modern
The fence surrounds a GRAVEYARD adjacent to the temple

DOUG
We walk past this temple every day
Karen --

KAREN
Yeah but Ive never seen this
before

A JAPANESE MAN stands before an ornate headstone lighting a
bundle of incense and bowing before the grave

KAREN
Its a Buddhist ritual The
incense smoke carries the prayers
to the spirits of his ancestors to
help them remain at peace

CLINK She turns as Doug grinning lights a cigarette with
his Zippo flicking it shut and pocketing it

DOUG
Its amazing Youre like this
infinite storehouse of wisdom Or
trivia Im not sure which

KAREN
Its not trivia Its what they
believe And its far better by
the way than your little pollution
ritual

Dougs grin softens to a smile He doesnt respond but
the way hes looking at Karen makes her curious

He turns away for a moment almost shyly dropping his
cigarette and crushing it Finally

ALEX
Your wish has been granted

Karen takes the file and opens it looking at the first page

ALEX
Its Yokos case but she didnt

Karen nods lacing her fingers in his But her eyes are
glazed and unfocused -- shes exhausted

DOUG
Your boss told me what happened
Im sorry

She turns away the memory bothering her Doug takes
hand massaging her fingers worried

DOUG
I talked to your teachers They
said you can take as much time as
you need We could go to Kyoto for
a weekend see those temples youre
always talking about

Karen tries to smile back but her hearts not in it

KAREN
Running away wont help

DOUG
You went to help someone who was
quite simply beyond help

KAREN
No thats not what I mean

She trails off trying to remember Doug waits

KAREN

Doug sees her frustration and tenderly brushes a hair from
her face

DOUG
Dont beat yourself up searching
for a greater truth Kat An old
woman passed away in her sleep
Its sad but thats all it is --

KAREN
Is that how they said she died

DOUG
Im sorry this happened to you
But maybe in a way it will help
you later Death is an unfortunate
but integral part of your future
career Theres no avoiding it
Maybe now youll be more ready
for it

KAREN
I dont think Ill ever be ready
for something like that

She turns away Doug wraps an arm around her Karen leans
into him and he strokes her hair

Revisions (Blue) -- 12604 52

The moment is broken by a soft KNOCK Detective Nakagawa
stands in the doorway holding a thick FILE

NAKAGAWA
Im sorry to disturb you Miss
Davies I was wondering if you
could answer some additional
questions

Doug stands intercepting Nakagawa He sticks out a hand
DOUG
Im Doug Karens boyfriend

Nakagawa nods Fixes Doug with a blank stare Taking the
hint Doug turns to Karen

DOUG
You up for this

Reluctantly Doug kisses her brow then exits Nakagawa
pulls a chair up to the bed and sits putting the file ona

KAREN
Okay Tired

NAKAGAWA

Three months I needed a social
welfare credit

NAKAGAWA
You said this was the first time
youd been in that house

KAREN
Yes

She notices Nakagawa isnt taking notes He seems somewhat
uncomfortable as if hes building to something

NAKAGAWA
About the Japanese boy you said you
saw there --
KAREN
Did you find him

NAKAGAWA
No not yet You said the boy had
been taped into the closet

KAREN

Yes thats right He was
holding a cat A black cat
(remembering)
There was a book in the closet
too I think it was a journal

NAKAGAWA
Did it belong to the boy

Revisions (Blue) -- 12604 53aA

KAREN
I dont think so I think it
belonged to a woman

Revisions (Blue) -- 12604
Nakagawa looks up Karen tries to explain
KAREN

The writing It looked feminine

Revisions (Blue) -- 12604

KAREN
I left it on the kitchen table

Nakagawa frowns scribbles a note

NAKAGAWA
I didnt see any book on the table
Perhaps someone moved it Did you
speak with the boy after you opened
the closet

She thinks recalling

KAREN
I asked him his name He said
Toshio

Nakagawa immediately tenses A long beat He can see how
exhausted Karen is But somethings troubling him

NAKAGAWA
One more question please

He slowly reaches into his pocket and pulls out THE PHOTO

Karen found and taped together He shows it to her

NAKAGAWA
We found this in the room where

Karen looks at the picture

KAREN
This is him This is the boy

NAKAGAWA
Are you certain

KAREN
Yes Positive

Nakagawa stares down at the picture in his hands
And Karen notices -- Nakagawas hands are shaking

KAREN
Detective Nakagawa

He looks up at her a faraway look in his eyes

KAREN
The whole time I was in that house
I felt something was wrong
Revisions (Blue) -- 12604 54a

From the expression on Nakagawas face shes onto
something

KAREN
What happened there

Nakagawa holds Karens gaze for a moment Even in her
exhausted state its clear -- shes as frightened as he

is

NAKAGAWA
The bodies of the son and daughter-
in-law of the woman you were caring
for were found in the attic

Karen just stares at him stunned

It seems that the son killed his
wife and then himself --

Theres a KNOCK on the door Igarashi stands in the
doorway

The Coroner walks to the small table removing the cloth
Yokos JAWBONE is underneath it

She watches Doug as he thinks Carefully
DOUG
Okay How about this the
American family knew about what had
happened there before and this
knowledge subconsciously caused
them to repeat the same events

A PALE HAND BURIED UNDER HER HAIR as if someone

familiar JOURNAL The same one Karen found in the

HIS POV its a journal Kayako kept As Peter flips through
it KAYAKOS VOICE speaks the words

and even though its mostly Japanese theres one word we
recognize that shes written repeatedly --

-- Peter Its been written over and over in both English
and Japanese as if she couldnt get enough of seeing it

Past the early pages Karen saw THE WRITING becomes more
manic the delicate script becoming a frantic scrawl
KAYAKOS VOICE becomes more desperate and pleading

Taped on the final page is A PHOTO PETER with a group of
his University friends at a party Kayako has scribbled
hearts around his head and SCRATCHED OUT the other faces
A bloody THUMBPRINT distorts Peters face Its still wet

Peter slams the book shut and drops it As he does a
PHOTOGRAPH falls out from inside landing right-side up

THE PHOTO is of PETER at a college party talking with

ts clear theyre having a great time with one another

but the photo is TORN IN HALF splitting Marias face
And KAYAKO is visible between them sadly and stoically
watching Peter strands of hair falling down her face

Peter and Karen both reach to pick up the photo at the same
time -- and they BUMP SHOULDERS Karen falls backwards
against the wall

onto her hands The odor is unmistakable

Karen drops the empty gas can and opens DOUGS

She flicks it Nothing

Karen tries the lighter again And again
Nothing

Kayako reaches out blood dripping from her gaping
mouth --

The lighter CATCHES

Karen flails with her free arm and opens the front
door --

-- just as Kayako GRABS HER ANKLE

Karen reaches outside anchoring a hand to the door
