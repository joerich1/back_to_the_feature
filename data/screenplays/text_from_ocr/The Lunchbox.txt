The Lunchbox
by

Ritesh Joginder Batra
OVER BLACK -
The sounds of early morning - a rooster crows a milk man
rings his bicycle bell and a train chugs on tracks another
train joins in the morning symphony

FADE IN
Two Mumbai Local trains pass each other in the morning haze

SHOTS

- Pigeons hundreds of them on a rooftop all the same
colors and stripes

- People in hordes descend upon a railway platform the
morning commute in office pastels and whites indinguishable
just like the pigeons

- A LUNCHBOX DELIVERYMAN aka a DABBAWALLAH in stark white
lugs a wood tray filled with lunchboxes over his head

- Lunchbox Delivery Men hauling lunchboxes hop on to a
train as it departs

- At another station the train slows down people get off

The montage continues as LUNCHBOXES get in and PEOPLE get
out at times it is the other way around

The conveyor belt of the city transports Lunchboxes and
PeopleIn and out up and down Its like the people are the
Luncboxes

Finally - a LUNCHBOX DELIVERYMAN focused navigates a
bicycle laden with luncboxes through the busy Mumbai traffic
This is Ilas Dabbawallah

INT ILAS ROOM - DAY

A neck tie sits over a little girls eyes like a blindfold
this is YASHVI 6 as her mother tries to pull the neck tie
down over her head Finally she succeeds and tucks it under
the collar of Yashvis school uniform and fastens it

The mother- ILA 30s pretty frantically readies Yashvi for
school Next she puts Yashvis socks over her little feet

ILA
Look both ways before you cross the
street

ILA (CONTD)
People drive like crazy these
daysAnd be very careful on the
way back toook

Yashvi nods along A pressure cooker WHISTLES Ila looks to
the kitchen This is a modest but comfortable apartment the
little girls room has a lot of toys in it- old and new and
her own art work on the walls

ILA (CONTD)
Dont walk under a treebranches
fall in the monsoons

YASHVI
But its not raining now
ILA
It can start raining again cant

it
A horn BLARES

Ila looks out the window - Three storeys down - an
autorickshaw converted into a school bus blares its horn
again CHILDREN are packed like sardines in it The whistle
of the pressure cooker goes off again Ila looks between the
kitchen and the school bus torn Meanwhile Yashvi finishes
tying her shoe laces and runs out the room

Ila watches from the window - Yashvi runs across the street
to the rickshaw looking both ways

The pressure cooker whistle shrieks calling out to Ila Ila
rushes to the kitchen

INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Ila is over the cooking range by the window The cooking
range is brand new it stands out in this kitchen

She pops open the pressure cooker and tastes the daal She
cringes disappointed Ila A voice from above -

MRS DESHPANDE (0S)
Did you remember all the masalas

Mrs Deshpande the voice of experience Ila shouts out the
window -

ILA
No auntie I forgot

( )

MRS DESHPANDE (0S)
I knew it from the first whistle
itself

Ila grabs her spice box from the shelf opens it she scans
the little compartments for the missing spice

MRS DESHPANDE (CONT’D)
Here you go

At the window a basket has been lowered down by rope from
the floor above

ILA
Thank you Auntie

Ila grabs the bottle of the spice from it and the basket is
pulled up again She sprinkles it over her daal

MRS DESHPANDE (0S)
Just a little bit does
itremember the way to a mans
heart is through his stomach

Ila laughs not really believing it
MRS DESHPANDE (0S) (CONTD)

but one day you will see
Ila mixes in the new addition whiffs of steam rise up
MRS DESHPANDE (0S) (CONTD)
-Mmmmthereits perfectOne
bite of this and he will build you
a Taj Mahal

Close on Ila she laughs

ILA
Taj Mahal is a tomb auntie

MRS DESHPANDE
(embarrassed-)
-Yes I knew that

Ila glances out the window the DABBAWALLAH- parks his
bicycle laden with lunchboxes in the compound

Ila grabs the three tiered metal lunchbox from the counter
The doorbell rings

( )

She pours daal in one tier dry mixed vegetables in the
other and two rotis in the last one And secures it shut

INT DOORWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Ila hands him the lunchbox

CUT TO
EXT STREET - DAY
A bead of sweat trickles down the Dabbawallahs forehead as
he cycles with a load of lunchboxes weaving through traffic
slowing down for pedestrians that cross in front of him
avoiding a pothole every now and then
CLOSE ON Ilas lunchbox it peeks out of the jute bag

dangling from the handle bar along with several other
Lunchboxes

big streets and small alleyways The Dabbawallah cycles on

with an air of urgency

A hub of DABBAWALLAHS on a busy platform All in the same
white uniform white Nehru caps over their heads some even
wear the same mustache

Our Dabbawallah passes the dabbas one-by-one to the others
The Dabbawallahs check the code of colors and symbols on each

lunchbox with the air of experts

They sort and load the lunchboxes on to large wood trays
thirty five to a tray This is an exercise in precision

A Mumbai Local chugs in and the flurry of sorting activity
on the platform culminates right on time

( )

As people jump on and off of the local train the
Dabbawallahs launch themselves into the packed local
carrying the wood trays loaded with lunchboxes over their
heads

INT TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

We are in the train with a Dabbawallah a different one but
wearing the same clothes cap and mustache as every other

out and new trays loaded with lunchboxes are passed in All
within the few seconds that the train stops

Here the dabbas are unloaded and the reverse process of
sorting them from the wood trays to the jute bags that hang
from bicycles begins

Bombay with jute bags full of dabbas

even more nervous job applicants A PEON comes in and grabs
all the waiting dabbas by their handles several in each
hand He walks into -

INT DESK FARM - CONTINUOUS

Endless rows of desks The Peon walks down one row
depositing dabbas on desks in his wake

The Peon puts the lunchbox on to a desk with a thump SAAJAN
FERNANDES 56 salt and pepper hair and the moustache and
bearing of a jaded bureaucrat He looks up from his work
regards the lunchbox and then goes back to his file totaling
numbers and making small check marks on the papers

( )

It all looks mind numbing but Saajan does it with the speed
of someone who has been checking numbers all his life The
lunchbox sits on his desk waiting

MR SHROFF

The boss - MR SHROFF 40s looks into the cubicle He wears a

INT CANTEEN - MOMENTS LATER
GROUPS of employees chat as they gorge on their lunch The

buzz of the lunch crowd much like a fish market fills the
room

( )

Saajan enters with the lunchbox and a bottle of water he
walks past several tables and finds a spot in the corner
away from everyone else He extracts the 3-tiered lunchbox
from the container and opens the boxes up one by one Steam
rises from the daal still hot

Saajan takes it in surprised He leans in and inhales his
eye glasses steam up He wipes them clean Next as he
examines the texture of the fluffy rotis his surprise only
heightens He takes a bite of his food it is ecstasy He
glances at the other tables people are busy chatting and
eating from their own 3-tiered metal lunchboxes Saajan takes
quick bites The bottle of water sits on the table untouched

around him the skyscrapers creeping in beyond A white
tennis ball that came into the balcony lies on the floor

Laughter comes in from somewhere Saajan looks across the
courtyard into the house next door the dinner table has been
set at the DSouza household More laughter

Saajan watches through the DSouzas window he looks at the
food they are eating the dishes that lie on the table and
they pile on to their plates

And then Little Anne DSouza the same girl that Saajan had
scolded earlier appears at the window Their eyes meet

Saajan Little Anne bangs the window shut on Saajan looks

and very quickly one roti is finished He goes for another
and comes up with a folded piece of paper instead He looks
around- is someone playing a prank on him Laughter at
another table

Saajan unfolds it curiously - it is a letter-

fan offIt is an old model Orient

heavily
