McGraw drops his last drip of beer crushes the can and
exits in the bathroom

The black suited man by the beer cooler turns around and
with the prep school girl in tow walks rapidly toward Pete
We see that the girl is crying

BLACK SUITED MAN 1

Richard holding tightly the hand of the terrified girl
leans next to Seths ear and whispers something Seth looks
at Pete

SETH

PETE
What Are you kidding I didnt do
anything

Richard whispers something else in Seths ear

SETH
He says you were scratching

PETE

SETH
You callin him a liar

Pete controls himself

PETE
Im not calling him a liar okay Im
simply saying that if I was
scratching and if I did scratch its
not because I was signaling the cop
its because Im fuckin scared

Richard speaks for the first time in a low calm voice to
Seth

RICHARD

of the situation

MCGRAW

PETE

Out of nowhere Richard WHIPS out his forty-five automatic

from his bullet wound he opens his floor safe and pulls
out a gun from it
Seth releases his brother

The two brothers start FIRING toward the counter
They HIT the bottles of alcohol on the shelf behind Pete

Pete is crouched on the ground as glass debris and alcohol
RAIN down on him

Seth grabs a roll of paper towels from off a shelf
Richard keeps FIRING

Seth douses the paper towels with lighter fluid sets it on
fire with his Zippo then tosses it

The flaming roll of paper towels FLIES through the air

The fireball lands behind the counter

The entire counter area immediately BURSTS INTO FLAMES Pete
screams from behind the counter

Seth smiles to himself and stands
Richard shakes his head in amusement and stands

Pete runs out from behind the counter ENGULFED IN FLAMES
still holding his weapon and FIRING

Seth and Richard hit the ground FIRING their 45s

Pete the human torch FALLS like a tree into the Hostess
Pastry display

Seth and Richard rise from the rubble

flames

starts it op The souped up engine ROARS to life We can
hear Seth mumbling under the motor

OVER we see Seth and Richard enjoying their getawayroad
trip Seth behind the wheel pops open a bottle of
prescription pills empties out four of the red capsules in
his hand pops them in his mouth and washes it back with a
slug of Jack Daniels from a pint bottle

Richard looks at Seth through the hole in his hand Like a
boxer Richard wraps his wounded hand with gaffers tape

The camera leaves the boys as they woosh down the street
and goes along the length of the car to the trunk It hangs
on the trunk Then we see through the trunk like Superman

AN OLDER WOMAN tied up and helpless in the trunk

home if you still feel the same
way --

JACOB
Thats very nice of Ted but Ill
call him tomorrow and tell him not
to bother waiting

KATE
I didnt want to talk about this in

But you dont believe in God
anymore

Not enough to be a pastor Look I
know this is hard on you kids After
Jennys death this is probably the
last thing you need But I cant do
it any longer My congregation needs
spiritual leadership Well they cant
get that from me anymore My faith is
gone To answer your question yes
I do believe in Jesus But do I love
them No After Jenny died I just
thought whats the point

KATE
(pushing him)
Its just all our lives youve been
a pastor For twenty years youve
preached trust in the lord And then
one day you wake up and say fuck him

JACOB
I didnt say fuck him Im just not
connected anymore

KATE
That happens youll get it back

JACOB
Kate give your old man a little
credit Every person who chooses the
service of God as their lifes work
has something in common I dont care
if youre a preacher a priest a nun
a rabbi or a Buddhist monk Many
many times during your life youll
look at your reflection in the mirror
and ask yourself am I a fool Weve
all done it Im not going through a
lapse What Ive experienced is closer
to awakening Im not trying to shake
your faith Ive just decided not to
devote my life to God anymore

KATE
What do you think Mom would say

JACOB
Moms got nothing to say shes dead

VIDEO INTERVIEW
Kelly Houge interviewing STANLEY CHASE of the FBI

STANLEY CHASE
For the time being we are very
confident we will apprehend the
fugitives in the next forty-eight
hours The Bureau local law
enforcement and the Texas Rangers
have all joined forces in forming a
dragnet to snare Seth and Richard
Gecko

KELLY HOUGE
Agent Chase does it appear that they
are heading for Mexico

STANLEY CHASE
Yes it does Kelly We have already
alerted the Mexican authorities They
intend to cooperate every way possible
in bringing these fugitives to
justice

KELLY HOUGE
Are you optimistic about the safety of
the hostage they took in Abilene
Gloria Hill

STANLEY CHASE
Weve received no news one way or the
other We can only hope for the best

KELLY HOUGE
What about the report from an
eyewitness at the liquor store who
said one of the brothers was shot
STANLEY CHASE
This cant be confirmed at this time
but we do believe it to be true We
have reason to believe it was the
youngest brother Richard and he was
shot in the vicinity of his neck and
shoulders by the stores clerk

KELLY HOUGE
Is it safe to assume that because the
death count involved and the loss of
life of law enforcement officers that
the Bureau the Rangers and the police
force are taking this manhunt
personally

STANLEY CHASE
I would say thats a very safe
assumption

Cut TO
RICHARD SMILES

RICHARD

(Newscasters voice)
Is it safe to assume since the law
enforcement authorities in the great
state of Texas are homosexuals of a
sick and deviate nature that they
will be too busy fucking each other
up the ass to actually catch The
Gecko Brothers

(in an FBI voice)
I would say thats a very safe
assumption

He changes a channel on the television We see a Casper the
Friendly Ghost cartoon on the screen

CASPER
Would you play with me

A big burly COP turns around

COP
Sure little boy A GHOST

The cop heads for the hills Casper cries

I seem to have touched a nerve Dont
be so sensitive Pops lets keep this
friendly But youre right enough
with the getting to know you shit

hand One way is me and you go round
an round all fuckin night The other
way is we reach some sort of an
understanding Now if we go down that
first path at the end of the day Ill
win But we go down the second well
both win Now I dont give a rats
ass about you or your fuckin family
Yall can live forever or die this
second and I dont care which The
only things I do care about are me
that son-of-a-bitch in the back and
our money And right now I need to get
those three things into Mexico Now
stop me if Im wrong but I take it

of your daughter your son and

trying anything funny and in the

this alive and we get into Mexico
Everybodys happy

JACOB
How do I know youll keep your word

SETH
Jesus Christ Pops dont start with
this shit

JACOB

You want me to sit here and be
passive The only way being passive in
this situation makes sense is if I
believe youll let us go Im not
there yet You have to convince me
youre telling the truth

SETH
Look dickhead the only thing you
need to be convinced about is that
youre stuck in a situation with a
coupla real mean motor scooters I
dont wanna hafta worry about you all
fuckin night And I dont think you
wanna be worrying about my brothers
intentions toward your daughter all

EXT PARKING LOT - NIGHT
The camper door FLIES OPEN and the two brothers and the
Fuller family step out into the night

They look across the parking lot at the Titty Twister

Chet lets out a SCREAM

Seth VIOLENTLY brings his HEAD FORWARD PULVERIZING Chets
NOSE

Chet FALLS to his KNEES in front of Seth

Seth HOOKS him with a powerful FIST UNDER his CHIN that
SNAPS Chets HEAD BACK and THROWS him on his BACK

After HITTING the GROUND Seth SENDS a SAVAGE KICK straight
to Chets FACE ROLLING HIM OVER

Chet is OUT
The whole altercation took two seconds

Everyones in shock and looks at Seth Seth looks back at
everyone

SETH

Richard and Seth laugh with each other

RICHARD
(slappin Seth five)
Your shit is forever together

They head for the door Richard stays behind for a second
and gives the fallen Chet a few swift kicks

INT THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT

If the Titty Twister looked like the asshole of the world
from the outside in the immortal words of Al Jolson You
aint seen nothin yet This is the kind of place where
they sweep up the teeth and hose down the cum the blood
and the beer at closing

In the back TOPLESS DANCERS do lap dances with customers
while a SLEAZY SEXY STRIPPER STRIPS to RAUNCHY MUSIC played
at ear drum-bursting level TWO MEN are in a savage
BAREKNUCKLE FIGHT surrounded by screaming customers of
bikers and truckers

One of the dancers is a man with a saddle on his back his
name is DANNY THE WONDER PONY The woman on his back in
the saddle feet in the stirrups hands on the reins is
ATHENA his rider They dance around to the cheers of the
crowd

Bikers and truckers play pool in the back Fights break out
here about one every ten minutes The customers may start
but the bouncer BIG EMILIO ends em

em

Seth Richard Jacob Scott and Kate walk through the door
They each individually take in the sights and the smells
Seth is the first to say something

SETH
Now this is my kinda place I could
become a regular

The man behind the bar is RAZOR CHARLIE He eyes the group
as they approach

Their difference from the usual road waif nomads who
populate the Twister disturbs him He exchanges a knowing
look across the room with Big Emilio as the group bellies
up to the bar
SETH
Whiskey

RAZOR CHARLIE
(in English)
You cant come in here

SETH
What dya mean

RAZOR CHARLIE
This is a private club Youre not
welcome

SETH
Are you tellin me Im not good enough

RAZOR CHARLIE

only
(points his finger to Seth)
You get out

Big Emilio almost magically appears behind Seth and places
HIS BIG BEEFY SAUSAGE-FINGERED HAND HARD on Seths shoulder

BIG EMILIO
(to Seth in Spanish)
Walk Pendaho

Seth slowly turns his eyes to the big hand on his shoulder

SETH
(low)

BIG EMILIO
(Spanish)

SETH
No Im going to count to three

BIG EMILIO

SETH

Jacob jumps in the middle
JACOB
Now wait a minute theres no reason
to get ugly Theres just a
misunderstanding going on here You
said this bar is for truckers and
bikers Well Im a truck driver

Everybody looks at Jacob
As Jacob talks he takes out his wallet

JACOB

If you look outside your door parked
in your parking lot youll see a big
ass recreational vehicle Thats mine
In order to drive that legally you
need a class two drivers license
That is the same license that the
DMV requires truck drivers to carry
in order to drive a truck

(he takes the license out

of his wallet and lays it

on the bar)
That is me and this is my class two
license This is a truck drivers bar
I am a truck driver and these are
my friends

Everybodys a little stunned after Jacobs speech

Razor Charlie picks up the license looks at Jacob looks at
everyone in the party and smiles

RAZOR CHARLIE
(to Jacob)
Welcome to the Titty Twister What
can I get you

Seth BRUSHES OFF Big Emilios paw

SETH
Bottle of whiskey and five glasses

Razor Charlies eyes go to Seth Even though he has a big
smile on his face he looks like hes going to kill Seth
But instead he just says

RAZOR CHARLIE
Coming right up

Razor Charlie goes for the bottle Big Emilio gives the
party one last look and walks away Richard gives Jacob a
buddy punch on the shoulder

RICHARD
Good job Pops

Seths still frying an egg on his head

SETH
Thats just fuckin typical Biggest
number one problem with Mexico its
not service oriented I was feelin
so good and those fuckin spies
brought me down

Richard puts his arm around Seth

RICHARD
Fuck em shake it off

Razor Charlie brings the bottle and the glasses Seth looks
at the guy still pissed

SETH
You serve food Jose

Razor Charlie knows Seths taunting him with a racial slur
but he just smiles and says

RAZOR CHARLIE
Best in Mexico

SETH
I kinda doubt that Were grabbin a
table send over a waitress to take
our order

Seth walks away and the group follows him

We just hang on the evil wheels turning inside of Razor
Charlies head

The five of them move across the floor to a table As they
walk Kate attracts stares wolf whistles and rude comments

from some of the patrons Jacob keeps near his daughter

The dancers do their sexy routines A big-chested
wild-haired blonde catches Scotts eye She winks at him

Richard leans over and whispers in Scotts ear

RICHARD
Anytime you want a lap dance with that
broad say the word Its on me kiddo

He gives the boys neck a squeeze Jacobs eyes survey the
surroundings Big Emilio and Razor Charlie quietly exchange
words about the party in Spanish

RAZOR CHARLIE
(in Spanish)
Theyre not the normal road trash we
normally feed on But itll be okay
No one knows theyre here

The five of them find a table and sit down

Seth still in a bad mood takes the cork out of the whiskey
bottle and tosses it He pours Richie and himself a glass

SETH
Who else

JACOB

SETH

(picking a fight)
Why not against your religion

JACOB
(wont be baited)

Scott shakes his head no

SETH

Seth pours Scott a shot

on-drinkers tremor

Seth turns to Kate

SETH

KATE

Seth just passes her the bottle She pours her own shot and
knocks it back

RICHARD
(to Seth)
Hey Dr Frankenstein I think you

Jacob turns to Seth and asks quietly

JACOB

SETH

JACOB
He backed down
SETH
Hes smilin at us But behind his
smile hes sayin Fuck you Jack

JACOB

SETH

(picking up the whiskey bottle)
Im gonna just sit here and drain

last drop if I still feel then the
way I feel now Im gonna take this
bottle and break it over his melon

JACOB

SETH
(tossing it off)
I never said do what I do I said do

JACOB

Richard Kate and Scott both turn to Jacob Nobody can
believe what he just said Neither can Seth who calmly lays
down his drinking glass

SETH
What did you call me

JACOB

Nothing I didnt make a statement I
asked a question Would you like me to
ask it again Very well Are you such

(pause)
The entire state of Texas along with
the FBI is looking for you Did they

every entrance to the border covered
Theres no way you could get across
Did you Yes you did Youve won
Seth enjoy it

Seth looks at Jacob then picks up the bottle

SETH
Jacob I want you to have a drink with

Jacob slides his empty glass over to Seth Seth pours booze
in Jacobs glass and his own Both men pick up the glasses

SETH
To your family

JACOB
To yours

They both knock em back and slap the empty glasses down

JACOB
Now is your shit together

SETH
Forever together

Seth turns to Scott

SETH
In that camper out there I saw a guitar I take
it thats yours

SCOTT
Yeah its mine

SETH
Go out and bring it in I feel a song coming on

Cut TO

Seth sitting at the table playing guitar singing Mexican
songs Some bikers truckers and whores have gathered
around their table Everyones groovin Seth finishes the
song Everybody applauds

Razor Charlie behind the bar grabs the greasy microphone
that he uses to announce dancers

RAZOR CHARLIE

(announcer voice in Spanish)
And now for your viewing pleasure The
Mistress of the Macabre The Epitome
of Evil The most sinister woman to
dance on the face of the earth Lowly
dogs get on your knees bow your
heads and worship at the feet of
SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM

The lights go down low A light hits the stage The opening
notes of the Coasters Down in Mexico fills the room
The crowd hushes up
And on the stage steps SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM

This Mexican goddess is beautiful but not the beauty that
Stendhal described in As the Promise of Happiness but
the beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom

She dances to the raunchy music not like she owned the
stage but like she owned the world

And if the patrons of the Titty Twister are her world the
world is proud to be her possession

All activity in the bar save Santanico stops Even the
FullerGecko table falls under her spell Especially
Richard Scott and Kate Seth knows this song and
accompanies from the table with the guitar

When the music builds to its explosive section

Santanico LEAPS from the stage LANDING in the middle of the
room

She does an eyes-closed voodoo dance in perfect step with
the beat As the music continues to play a very fucked-up
looking Chet Pussy walks in He goes over to Razor Charlie
and points at Seths table describing what happened

As the last verse plays Santanico like a snake comes up
from the ground on top of the FullerGecko table

Richard Kate and Scott are enraptured

Santanico scans the table zeroing in on our boy Richard
She STANDS OVER him

While moving her body to the music she lifts up the whisky
bottle from the table and pours the whiskey down her leg

She lifts up her foot with the whiskey dripping from her
toes and sticks it in Richards face

SANTANICO
(to Richard in Spanish)
Drink up

Richie mesmerized sucks the whiskey off her toes The
CROWD GOES WILD Santanico smiles master of all she
surveys
Jacob and Scott are embarrassed

Kate oddly enough is turned on by the controlling power
this woman has over a man shes deathly feared

Seth laughs out loud a Mexican yi yi yiii laugh keeping
the beat with his guitar

Across the room Razor Charlie Chet by his side motions
over Big Emilio He begins explaining with pointing what
Seth and company did to Chet

Richard continues to suck her toes

The song ends Santanico extracts her foot from Richards
mouth Steps off the table Takes a drink of whiskey Looks
down at the seated Richard

She GRABS the back of his hair YANKS his head BACK His
mouth OPENS because shes hurting him She LEANS her FACE
OVER his like shes going to kiss him Then lets the whiskey
from her mouth fall into his They never touch The crowd
applauds She lets go of Richards hair Except for Jacob

and Richard both for their own reasons the table applauds
none louder than Seth

SETH
Bravo Bravo Bravo Now thats what
I call a fuckin show

One of Santanicos FLUNKIES brings the naked woman a robe
which she puts on

Richard still in a daze looks up at his new friend

SETH
(snapping his fingers)
Earth to Richie Dont you wanna ask
your new friend to join us

RICHARD
Yeah

SETH
Well then ask her dumb ass

RICHARD
(looking up at Santanico)
Por favor Senorita Would you care to
join us
SANTANICO
(to Richard)
Muy bien gracias

Santanico sits down next to Richie Seth pours her a drink

SETH
Richie you lucky bastard
(to Santanico)
Now little lady you could of just as
easily done that to me Who a Nelly
You got my dick harder n Chinese
arithmetic

The table laughs

SETH
Which reminds me of a joke Little Red
Riding Hood is walking through the
forest and she comes across Little Bo
Peep and Little Bo Peep says
Little Red Riding Hood are you
crazy Dont you know the Big Bad Wolf
is walking these woods and if he finds
you hes gonna pull down your dress
and squeeze your titties Then Little
Red Riding Hood hitches up her skirt
and taps a 357 Magnum she has
holstered on her thigh and says No
he wont

As Seth tells his joke Jacob notices Razor Charlie Big
Emilio and Chet moving rapidly towards their table

JACOB
(to himself)
Oh shit
(to Seth)
Seth --

Seth waves him away

SETH

Not now So finally she comes across
the Big Bad Wolf and the Big Bad
Wolfs laughing and says Little Red
Riding Hood you know better than to
be walking around these woods alone
You know Im just gonna have to pull
down your dress and squeeze your
titties Then Little Red Riding Hood
whips out her 357 cocks it sticks
it in the Big Bad Wolfs face and
says No you wont Youre gonna eat
me just like the story says

Seth starts laughing at his own joke uproariously Richard
Kate Scott and Santanico join in too Before Jacob can say
anything --

The Titty Twister trio stand over the table

RAZOR CHARLIE
(to Chet in Spanish)
Which one

CHET
(pointing at Seth)
This piece of shit broke my finger
and my nose
(pointing at Richard)
then this fag kicked me in the ribs
while I was down

Thats all Big Emilio has to hear

BIG EMILIO
(to The Gecko Brothers)
Up

RICHARD
Fuck off ape man

Big Emilio leans in with his beefy hand GRABS Richard by
the shoulder Richard lets out a howl as blood pours from
his wounded shoulder

Santanico steps back from the table

Seth jumps to his feet and FIRES a round from his 45 into
Big Emilio sending his bullet-ridden body to the floor
Razor Charlie whips out a straight version of his name sake

and SLASHES Seth across the face

Seth SCREAMS at the top of his lungs as his hand goes up to
his laid open cheek

Richard who has fallen to the ground holding his wound
brings up his 45 and starts BLASTING

Razor Charlie takes a bullet in the head chest and belly
before he hits the floor

Jacob and his children have hit the floor as well to stay
out of gunfire

The bikers truckers waitresses and whores all stop what
they were doing

The music continues to play though the dancers stop
dancing

Santanico whos closest to the two brothers smells
something

Her NOSTRILS FLARE

Richard moves to his brother who takes out a handkerchief
and puts it to his face

RICHARD
How are you

SETH
Scarred for life thats how I am

Seth looks up and sees Chet still standing there

SETH
You thought it was pretty funny
didnt you

Both brothers FIRE on Chet Chets blown left right
left right then drops pointing their guns towards
the crowd

SETH
Everybody be cool or youll be just
as dead as these fucks

SLOW MOTION Blood drips down the side of Seths face
SLOW MOTION It splatters to the floor

The CAMERA scans the crowd The patrons are scared but the
waitresses whores and dancers lick their lips

SLOW MOTION Blood drips from Richards shoulder It falls
to the floor splattering

WE MOVE INTO SANTANICOS FACE A special aroma fills
her nostrils Her eyes lock on Richard The look on her face
could easily be read as intense sexual desire

CLOSE-UP KATE ON FLOOR
Looks up and watches eyes wide with fear Santanicos
transformation

Her NOSE RECEDES INTO her face like a rodents The whites
of her eyes turn YELLOW The FANGS of a beast PROTRUDE from
her mouth Kate yells from the floor

KATE
(yelling)
Richie look out

Before Richie can turn around

SANTANICO LEAPS ACROSS THE FLOOR LANDS on his BACK and
SINKS her FANGS into Richies wounded SHOULDER

Richard LETS LOOSE with an agonizing SCREAM

Seth turns to his brothers cry

He sees SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM like a mongoose attached to
a cobra legs wrapped around Richards waist fangs buried

deep in his shoulder and Richard screaming and slamming
about trying to knock her off

Richard screams to Seth

RICHARD
Shoot her Shoot her Get her off

Seth tries to aim his gun but theres too much movement He
cant get a clear shot

Jacob and his children cant believe what theyre seeing

Richard cant take it anymore his knees buckle Santanico
rides him down to the floor

Seth gets a clear shot he takes aim and FIRES hitting the
vamp in the head blowing her off his brother

Richard whos on all fours tries to stand and gets about
half way before he stops saying

RICHARD
(with his dying breath)
Fucking Bitch

He tumbles over a corpse

SETH
Richie
Suddenly the eyes of Big Emilio Razor Charlie and Chet
Pussy pop open The dead men sit up with evil grins on
their faces

The patrons scream

A WHORE locks the front door (which is a complicated lock
with steel rods going into the ground) turns toward the bar
and yells

WHORE
Dinner is served

The bikers and truckers who have been transfixed watching
the impossible realize that the waitresses naked dancers
and whores who they were pawing just five minutes ago have
turned into yellow-eyed razor-fanged drool-dripping
VAMPIRES

The vamps attack

What follows is a shark feeding frenzy Whores who had been
sitting on customers laps sink their teeth into unshaven
necks

Naked strippers and bikers wail the shit out of each other
Truckers get their heads caved in by women half their size
The patrons use what ever they can find to fend off the
monsters chairs chair legs broken bottles switchblades
anything

Jacob Kate and Scott make a dash and dive behind the bar
They hide and watch

Seth stands where his was limp dick of a 45 in his hand
too freaked scared and stunned to do anything He stands

motionless watching what he cant believe

Behind him Santanico who lies next to the dead Richard
eyes POP OPEN

She RISES in her snakedance way
Seth feels her and SPINS in her direction gun raised
SANTANICO
Lets see if you taste as good as your

brother

She approaches Seth who FIRES at her BAM BAM BAM
CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK She laughs and gives her
hair a toss back Seth moving backwards is terrified

Santanico gives Seth a SWINGING ROUND HOUSE PUNCH to the
JAW that sends him FLYING over a table SLIDING ACROSS the
FLOOR and INTO the WALL

A bad-ass biker named FROST with a hideous burn on the
side of his face stands on top of a pool table swinging a
pool cue left to right fending off vamps

Big Emilio picks up a biker who stabbed him with a
switchblade and throws the poor bastard from one end of the
bar to the other

The biker-winner of the bare knuckle fight SEX MACHINE
goes head to head with a stripper

The vamp might have superhuman strength but Sex Machine has
close to superhuman strength and hes matching the
vamp bitch blow for blow

Then he GRABS her by the waist LIFTS her up over his head
and BRINGS her DOWN HARD on an upturned table IMPALING her
on the wooden leg

FROST is still swinging his POOL CUE when Razor Charlie
appears straight razor in hand

Frost JUMPS off the table to meet the challenge Razor
Charlie SWINGS at him Frost LEAPS back SWINGING his pool
cue at him They do this dance till Frost CRACKS Charlie
UPSIDE the HEAD with the pool cue breaking it in half
Charlie FEELS the HIT Frost PLUNGES the splintered end of
the cue in Razor Charlies heart

Green blood comes out of his chest as Charlie screams the
vampires death scream

Seth comes to and finds Santanico standing over him He
tries to rise but Santanico places her bare foot on his
chest pinning him down to the floor He tries to move but
the pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block
placed on his chest

SANTANICO
Im not gonna drain you completely
Youre gonna turn for me Youll be
my slave Youll live for me Youll
eat bugs because I order it Because
I dont think youre worthy of human
blood youll feed on the blood of
stray dogs Youll be my foot stool
And at my command youll lick the dog
shit from my boot heel Since youll
be my dog your new name will be
Spot Welcome to slavery

SLOW MOTION A WHISKEY BOTTLE FLIES THROUGH the AIR sailing
end over end

CLOSE-UP SANTANICO

looking down at Seth her face contorts to FEED MODE when
the bottle HITS her SQUARE in the HEAD SHATTERING

We see that Jacob behind the bar threw it

Santanico bathed in whiskey and broken glass is
momentarily dazed She looks down at Seth

Seth sits up 45 in hand and fires

Santanico is HIT in the CHEST The bullet from the gun makes
the liquor-soaked robe ignite

Santanico SCREAMS as she GOES UP IN FLAMES
Big Emilio sees Santanicos fiery death He lets out a cry

BIG EMILIO
Noooooo

He turns his hateful gaze on the two humans

Seth and Jacob see Big Emilio zeroing in on them then they
see him move his big frame in their direction Seth turns to
Jacob

SETH
We may be in trouble

Big Emilio walks steadily through the bar like Godzilla
walks through Tokyo Tipping over tables knocking fighting
vamps and humans alike on their asses on his way to stamp
out Seth and Jacob A TRUCKER JUMPS in his path to attack
him with a QUICK SWING of his hand the trucker is brushed
aside receiving a broken neck for the effort

Big Emilio never breaks his stride or takes his eyes off
Seth and Jacob

Seth and Jacob both grab pieces of wood holding it like a
weapon but the wood looks puny compared to their opponent
Big Emilio stands in front of them The two men hold their
wood tight Fangs grow in Big Emilios mouth that make him
look like a huge walking shark

Just when Big Emilios ready to strike he hears behind him

VOICE (0S)
Hey you monkey man

Big Emilio turns and sees Sex Machine across the room

SEX MACHINE
Anything you gotta say to them say
to me first

Both Seth and Jacob ATTACK Big Emilio from behind He
effortlessly knocks them away

They both hit the ground

Sex Machine gestures with his hand to Big Emilio to come
ahead

Big Emilio CHARGES towards Sex Machine like a runaway
locomotive

Sex Machine stands his ground waiting for IMPACT The two
huge men COLLIDE What follows is literally a war of the
Gargantuans The two mastiffs POUND each other till one
buckles Finally the one who buckles first is Big Emilio
who HITS the floor

Once on the floor Seth and Jacob stand over the huge vamp
BEATING him with clubs and pipes like LAs finest The
vamp can do nothing except SQUIRM on the floor from the
savage beating

SEX MACHINE
Thats enough

Jacob and Seth stop

Sex Machine holds a pool cue in his hand He SNAPS off the
end tip making it jagged and like a spear STICKS it into
big vamps fallen body Big Emilio SCREAMS TWITCHES and
dies The pool cue sticks out straight up from the dead
vamp

Chet Pussy spies Ms Apple Pie Pussy herself Kate He
breaks into a lecherous grin and licks the blood from
around his mouth
Kate and Scott are cowering behind the bar when Chet appears
over the top They both let out a scream Scott goes to
protect his sister and receives a punch in the face for his
trouble Chet dives at Kate

CHET
You know what everybody says about me
I suck

Chet goes to bite Kate grabbing at her t-shirt and sees
her crucifix HE recoils backwards Scott grabs hold of
his head from behind Kate jumps up from the floor rips
off her cross and grabs Chet by his beatnik beard opening
his mouth She SHOVES the cross inside Chets eyes roll
up back into his head Scott SLAPS Chet hard on the back

GULP

Chet has swallowed the crucifix A SIZZLING sound is heard
moving down from his throat to his belly He opens his
mouth and lets out a noise similar to a train whistle He
jumps up from behind the bar doing a wild dance from pain
He jumps from wall to wall and floor to ceiling screaming
all the while

Kate and Scott watch him from the bar mischievous grins on
their faces

Chet is on his knees arms stretched out yelling at the top
of his lungs like a vamp King Lear

CHET
I-AM- IN-AGONNNYYYY

Chet breaks off a chair leg muttering to himself

CHET
Stop the pain stop the pain stop the
pain stop the pain stop the pain

He plunges the stake into his own heart but instead of the
vampires cry that escapes from the others upon being
staked Chet lets out a sigh of relief

By this time there are not too many people left Most of the
vampire have been killed by wooden stakes and most of the
customers have been butchered or drained

All thats left on the vampire side are two naked dancers
and two whores On the human side are Seth Jacob and his
kids Sex Machine and Frost Aside from the children who
are hiding behind the bar all the humans are holding
wooden stakes

The four human men group together The four female vampires
charge teeth exposed snarling and dripping with blood
Seth Jacob Sex Machine and Frost raise their weapons and
slam almost simultaneously the four vamps All four
staked bodies hit the floor

Kate and Scott run from behind the bar to their fathers
side

They all stand looking at the horrible carnage that has
taken place The floor is littered with dead bodies

FROST
Aint they supposed to burn up or
something

At that moment a bright flash ERUPTS illuminating
everyones face The sound of quick burning flames fills
the air Everybody shields their eyes from the intense
light which lasts only a split second

It vanishes along with the bodies of the vampires All
that remains is a smoldering mess of goo where the bodies
once lay

They all stare at the mess for a few seconds and then RUN
for the door Its locked They BANG on the door but its
useless It aint budging yet they all go on banging

Except for Seth He never ran for the door He walks over
to his dead brothers body and kneels beside it

He takes his dead hand

SETH
Richie Im sorry I fucked things up
Youd really like it in El Ray Wed
find peace there I love you little
brother Ill miss ya bad

Seth goes to kiss his brothers lips when RICHARD S EYES
POP OPEN Theyre YELLOW Seth RAISES his head in surprise

RICHARD
Im glad you feel that way Seth I
love you too

Richard GRABS Seth by the front of his shirt and pulls him
down to him Fangs are now exposed Seth tries to pull away
He SCREAMS for the others to help Richard PULLS Seth down
to striking distance and opens his mouth to take the big
bite when Sex Machine grabs Seth from behind and YANKS him
from Richards grasp Jacob Frost and the kids have
surrounded Richard and proceed to KICK him and STOMP his
head Sex Machine picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a
wall He picks up one of the chair legs and walks over to
where the others are holding Richard down Richard sees the
wood in the bikers hand He knows what that means Seth
whips out his 45 and points it at Sex Machine

SETH
Touch my brother with that stake
biker and vampires wont need to
suck your blood theyll be able to
lick it up off the floor

SEX MACHINE
He aint your brother no more

SETH
Thats a matter of opinion and I
dont give a fuck about yours

Jacob Frost and the kids continue to hold Richard down to
the ground

JACOB
Dont be an idiot hell kill us all

Seth aims his gun at the group

SETH
Shut up

Richards giggling

RICHARD
Yeah shut up

Seth still holding the outstretched gun takes the stake
out of Sex Machines hand Seth lowers the 45

SETH
Hold him down

The smile evaporates from Richards face
SETH
Richie heres the peace in death I

could never give you in life

Seth puts the stake over Richards heart Using the butt of
his 45 like a hammer he POUNDS the stake into Richards
heart Richard screams and dies They all stand around the
body as it BURSTS INTO FLAMES and disintegrates into goo
Seth breaks away from the group and walks over to the bar
He grabs a bottle of whiskey and starts downing it Kate
of all people walks away from the group and joins Seth at
the bar

KATE
Are you okay

SETH
Peachy Why shouldnt I be The
worlds my oyster except for the
fact that I just rammed a wooden
stake in my brothers heart because
he turned into a vampire even
though I dont believe in vampires
Aside from that unfortunate business
everythings hunky-dory

KATE
Im really sorry

SETH
Bullshit You hate us If you had half
a chance youd feed us to them

JACOB
Then why didnt I

Jacob walks over to Seth

JACOB
I saved your life I didnt have to
but I did And Im sorry you lost your
brother Im sorry hes dead Im
sorry everybodys dead Now if were
gonna get out of this we need each
other And we need you sober and
thinking not drunk and

As Jacob has been talking a sound has started that has
grown LOUDER and LOUDER Jacob stops in mid-sentence to
identify it

JACOB
What the hell is that

FROST
At first I just thought it was birds
SEX MACHINE
No its more of a gnawing sound
Birds peck they dont gnaw Rats
gnaw

Seth puts the bottle in his hand down

SETH
Its bats

EXT TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT

The outside of the Titty Twister is literally covered with
hats CLAWING FLAPPING GNAWING trying like hell to get
inside

INT TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT

Everybody listens to the bats SCRATCHING and clawing all
along the walls the roof and at the front door Everyones
scared shitless and nobody has the slightest idea what to
do next The door begins to crack and splinter little
claws poke their way through

JACOB
Give me a hand

Jacob runs to a table top He grabs it and covers the area
the bats are trying to claw through The others grab other
items to help secure and barricade the door

As the survivors are panickedly boarding up the door and
the windows a DEAD BIKER that the vampires fed on pops
open his yellow eyes He sits up and sees all the furious
activity Everyones so busy they dont notice their new
friend The dead biker vamp sets his sights on Kate whos
putting a board into place He springs to his feet and
POUNCES on her just as Sex Machine turns from across the
room in her direction

SEX MACHINE
Watch out girly

The biker vamp GRABS Kate from behind She lets out a
scream The vamp holds her close to him in a bear hug but
shes moving around so much he cant get a clear bite The
others hear the scream and look toward Kate Sex Machine
Big Emilios baseball bat in hand is halfway to the rescue
As the biker vamp opens his mouth to take a juicy bite out
of Kates shoulder Kate RAMS her head back hitting the
vamp in the mouth and breaking his fangs He releases her
and spits out his teeth just as Sex Machine runs up and
SWINGS the baseball bat upside the vamps head breaking
the bat in two and sending the vamp to the floor As the
vamp lies on the floor seeing stars Sex Machine grabs one
of the broken ends of the bat and SHOVES it in the vamps
heart He dies and bursts into flames

At that point three other dead victims rise to a sitting
position Sex Machine grabs a chair and THROWS it to the
ground breaking it He grabs the four legs

SEX MACHINE
(mumbling to himself)
Goddamn fuckin vampires

The biker has turned into Captain Sex Machine Vampire
Hunter He stakes two of the vampires as they get to their
feet Both SPEW green blood scream die and burst into
flames The third a trucker vampire wearing a cat cap
SMACKS Sex Machine in the mouth which sends the biker for
a loop

As CAT CAP runs toward the fallen Sex Machine Kate JUMPS

on his back from behind Both of them go tumbling into a
stack of whiskey cases Sex Machine runs over and grabs Kate
by the hand pulling her up and out of the way Cat Cap is
lying in a pile of broken bottles and whiskey Sex Machine
raises his stake as Cat Cap dies and DRIVES it in the

vamps black heart Cat Cap dies and bursts into flames
which hits the whiskey starting a giant fire

SEX MACHINE
Fire

Frost and Jacob stop barricading and run to the fire

FROST
(to Sex Machine)
Well put this out You stake the rest
of these fuckers

SEX MACHINE
Way ahead of ya
(to Kate)

Whats your name girly

KATE
Kate whats yours

SEX MACHINE
Sex Machine Pleased to meetcha
Kate lets stake these blood-sucker
fuckers

Kate and Sex Machine give each other a high five and go to
work STAKING the dead bodies

Jacob and FROST beat down the fire with their jackets and
whatever else is at hand

A hole begins to appear where a window had been plastered
over Little claws scrape their way through Scott stands
in front of the window

scott
(yelling)
We got a problem

Seth who is barricading doors and window looks in Scotts
direction The hole in the plaster cracks open and out POPS
a little fleshy vampire batrat head The batrat which is
SQUEAKING and HISSING its head off tries to SQUEEZE its
body through the newly formed hole

Seth gun in hand RUNS to the window He points the 45
point-blank range at the head of the batrat

The batrat sees this makes an oh shit face and YANKS
his head back through the hole

Seth was ready to fire he lowers his gun in bewilderment
when

WHAM

The batrat BURSTS through the hole like shot out of a
cannon HITTING Seth in the gut and sending him FLYING
LANDING HARD on his back

Once Seth hits the ground the bat-thing (which has the body
of a fat rat with a bats large wingspan) lickity-split

RUNS UP Seths body to his juggler Seths hand GRABS the
bats neck and tries to PUSH it away But the bat-thing has
its CLAWS DUG in Seths clothes The bat-thing is just
inches from Seths face Its mouth is SNAPPING

SETH
Get this bastard off of me

Frost leaves Jacob with the fire comes from behind and
GRABS the bat-thing and YANKS it off of Seth

Sex Machine and Kate are a green bloody mess from their
preventative staking of dead bodies Sex Machine kneels by a
dead body raising the stake in his hand to spear him The

body SPRINGS UP and bites Sex Machine on the arm Red blood
squirts all over Sex Machine screams then brings the stake
down in the bodys chest It dies burns and turns into goo
Sex Machine holds his bit arm and wraps it with a piece of

his shirt He quickly looks around to see if anybody saw him
get bit Nobody saw it everybody was too busy

Frost holds the FLAPPING FIGHTING SNAPPING bat-thing in
front of him at arms length He struggles with it fora
while then

BASHES its head against the bar The first bash takes some
fight out of the little fucker so Frost BASHES his head
against the bar six or seven times He then THROWS the
bat-thing on the bar turns it over garbs a pencil ina
cup next to the register and RAMS it in the bat-things
heart The bat-thing coughs and dies Theres a FLASH of
FLAMES followed by a pile of goo

Sex Machine and Kate have covered up a hole in the plastered
window with a table while Frost Scott and Seth wrestle with
the bat-thing

Jacob has put out the fire Everybody comes together
exhausted and takes a breather Outside the bats continue
to try and claw their way in

JACOB
Is everybody okay

Everyone mutters yeah

JACOB
Okay does anybody here know whats
going on

SETH

Yeah I know whats going on We got
a bunch of fuckin vampires outside
trying to get inside and suck our
fuckin blood Thats it plain and
simple And I dont wanna hear any
bullshit about I dont believe in
vampires because I dont fuckin
believe in vampires either But I do
believe in my own two fuckin eyes
and with my two eyes I saw fuckin
vampires Now does everybody agree
were dealin with vampires

Everybody agrees

SETH
You too preacher

JACOB
Im like you I dont believe in
vampires but I believe in what I saw

SETH
Good for you Now since we all
believe were dealing with vampires
what do we know about vampires
Crosses hurt vampires Do you have a
cross

JACOB
In the Winnebago

SETH
In other words no

SCOTT
What are you talking about We got
crosses all over the place All you
gotta do is put two sticks together
and you got a cross

SEX MACHINE
Hes right Peter Cushing does that
all the time

SETH
I dont know about that In order for
it to have any power I think its
gotta be an official crucifix

JACOB
Whats an official cross Some piece
of tin made in Taiwan What makes that
official If a cross works against
vampires its not the cross itself
its what the cross represents The
cross is a symbol of holiness

SETH
Okay Ill buy that So we got crosses
covered moving right along what
else

FROST
Wooden stakes in the heart been
workin pretty good so far

SEX MACHINE

Garlic holy water sunlight I
forget does silver do anything to a
vampire

SCOTT

Thats werewolves

SEX MACHINE
I know silver bullets are werewolves
But Im pretty sure silver has some
sort of effect on vampires

KATE
Does anybody have any silver

ALL
No

KATE
Then who cares

SCOTT
Whens sunrise

Jacob looks at his watch

JACOB
About two hours from now

KATE
So all we have to do is get by fora
few more hours and then we can walk
right out the front door

SEX MACHINE
Yeah thats true but I doubt our
barricades that door those plastered
windows and these walls will last two
more hours with those bat fucks
fuckin with â€˜em

JACOB
Has anybody here read a real book
about vampires or are we just
remembering what a movie said I mean
a real book

SEX MACHINE
You mean like a Time-Life book
Everybody laughs

FROST
(in a cowboy voice)
John Wesley Hardin so mean he once
shot a man for snorin

JACOB
I take it the answers no Okay then
what do we know about these vampires

SETH
Aside from theyre thirsty

FROST
Well one thing they might got super
human strength but you can hurt em

JACOB
Yeah that bottle upside the head of
Santanico didnt kill her but it
didnt feel too good either

SEX MACHINE
Another thing you try and rama
broken chair leg in a human you
better be one strong son-of-a-bitch
The human body is one rough-tough
machine But these vamps got soft
bodies The texture of their skin is
softer mushier You can push shit
right through em Conceivably if
you hit one hard enough you could
take their fuckin head off

SCOTT
You could take their head off

SETH
Actually our best weapon against
these satanic cocksuckers is this man
(he points at Jacob)
Hes a preacher

Frost and Sex Machine look toward Jacob

SETH
As far as Gods concerned we might
just as well be a piece of fuckin
shit But hes one of the boys Only
one problem his faith aint what it
used to be

Jacob PUNCHES Seth in the mouth sending him to the floor
Jacob stands over him

JACOB
Ive had enough of your taunts

Seth looks up from the floor

SETH
Im not taunting you We need you A
faithless preacher doesnt mean shit
to us But a man whos a servant of
God can grab a cross shove it in
these monsters asses A servant of
God can bless the tap water and turn
it into a weapon

Seth rises

SETH
know why you lost your faith How
could true holiness exist if your wife
can be taken away from you and your
children Now I always said God can
iss my fuckin ass Well I changed
my lifetime tune about thirty minutes
ago cause I know without a doubt
whats out there trying to get in
here is pure evil straight from hell
And if there is a hell and those
monsters are from it theres got to
be a heaven Now which are you a
faithless preacher or a mean
mother fuckin servant of God

Jacob has to laugh at that So does everybody else Jacob
sticks out his hand and shakes Seths

JACOB
Im a mean mother fucking servant of
God

The laughter and good humor passes quickly and the only
sound to be heard is that of the bats gnawing and clawing
It immediately reminds the group of the deep deep shit
theyre in

KATE
I dont know if I can take two hours
of that noise
FROST
You can Youll take it cause ya got
no choice Howd ya like twenty four
hours of it lying in a muddy ditch
with only the rotting corpses of your
friends to keep you company

JACOB
What are you talking about

FROST
Back in 72 I was in Nam trapped
behind enemy lines lying in a rat hole
with my entire squad dead They
thought they killed everybody and
except for me they were right But it
wasnt for lack of trying A grenade
blew up right next to me thats why
Im so pretty

They thought I was dead so I played dead They dumped all
the bodies in a ditch All I could do was lie there playing
possum Dead bodies under me dead bodies on top of me
listening to the enemy laugh and joke hour after hour after
hour

As Frost goes into his monologue the sound fades out and
the camera moves to Sex Machine Hes having a hot flash He
cant hear anything Hes looking at Frost speaking but he
doesnt hear any sound Then he hears a deep MALE VOICE
say

MALE VOICE (V0O)
Thirst

Who the fuck was that he thinks to himself He turns
around nobodys there No one else in the group seems to

hear it A FEMALE VOICE seductively says

FEMALE VOICE (VO)
Thirst

We hear Sex Machines thought in a voice answer

SEX MACHINE (VO)
Stop fucking saying that

TWO MALE VOICES (VO)
Thirst

SEX MACHINE (VO)
That bite werent nothin It just
hurt like a son-of-a-bitch thats
all It barely punched the skin

Sex Machine looks at Frost whos acting out his story The
biker is pantomiming fighting and slashing Hes describing
all the while but we cant hear anything All we hear are

many voices male female children saying

VOICES (VO)
Thirst Thirst Thirst

Sex Machine begins looking at the other members of the group
in a thirsty way He stares at each of their necks closer
and closer until he can see the veins on Frosts neck
actually pulsating throbbing beckoning to him Sex Machine
has turned into a vampire

The sound comes back as Frost finishes his story

FROST

-and then when I came back to my
senses I realized I had killed the
entire VC squadron single handedly
My bayonet had blood and chunks of
yellow flesh on it like some cannibal
shish kabob And to this day I dont
have the slightest idea how I --

Sex Machine lets out a hideous cry

SEX MACHINE
THIRST

Frost SCREAMS as Sex Machine grabs hold of him and BITES
into his neck

The group tries to PULL the TWO men apart

Jacob gets his arm around Sex Machines neck and tries
pulling

Sex Machine takes his teeth out of the bikers neck and
SINKS them in Jacobs arm

Jacob SCREAMS and lets go
Seth Kate and Scott react to Jacob being bit

Sex Machine GRABS Jacob and TOSSES him effortlessly over the
bar CRASHING into a shelf full of liquor bottles
Frost HOPS around the room mad as a hornet holding his
bleeding neck

FROST
I been bit He fuckin bit me

Sex Machine PUNCHES Seth in the face dropping him like a
sack of potatoes

He smacks the shit out of Kate She goes FLYING into a
table

Sex Machine turns seeing Frost breaking off a big table
leg Frost looks at the big vamp

FROST
(to Sex Machine)
Youre dead mother fucker Youre
gonna bite me You just turned me
into a vampire asshole

SEX MACHINE
What are you gonna do about it

Frost table leg in hand RUNS SCREAMING his head off
straight at Sex Machine

Sex Machines nostrils flare He raises his meaty fist and
pulls it back so he can really haul off

Frost top speed stake raised screaming Sex Machine lets
loose with his punch Seth Scott and Kate look up from the
floor Jacob rises from behind the bar Frosts face
COLLIDES with Sex Machines fist Sex Machine hits Frost so
hard it lifts the biker off the ground and propels him
through the air

Seth sees where Frost is heading and says

SETH
Oh shit

Jacob sees

JACOB
Good lord

Frost in mid-air HITS the barricaded plastered overwindow
and CRASHES through it

Sex Machine lets loose with a maniacal laugh Hundreds of
bat-things fly into the bar Seth grabs the two kids by the
hand and runs for the backroom

Behind the bar Jacob grabs two pieces of wood from off the
ground

Ten bat-things are in hot pursuit of Seth Kate and Scott
who are RUNNING for their lives They get to the door of the
back room whip it open dive in and SLAM it behind them An
ugly fleshy bat-thing manges to get its head caught in the
door as it closes Kate and Scott PUSH on the door as hard
as they can The bat-things head which is inside screams
howls and snaps in fury

Seth turns toward the batvamp in the door He sticks his
-45 in its big mouth

SETH
You wanna suck something suck on
this

He FIRES four shots that blow the bat vamps head all over
the wall

Kate yells

KATE
We have to go back for Daddy

SETH
Daddys dead

KATE
Noooo

She spins and grabs the door knob ready to fling the door
and help her father Scott grabs her and pushes her up
against the wall

SCOTT
Hes right Kate Daddys dead He was
too far away If flinging that door
and filling this room with those
bat-things would save him Id fling
it The only thing itll do is turn us
into one of them

SETH
He needs our help

SCOTT
Hes beyond our help You saw him get
bit I saw him get bit We all saw it
You cant help him Ive got no one
left to lose but you I cant be alone
again Were sticking together

Just then they hear Jacobs voice BOOMING from the bar room

INT BAR ROOM - NIGHT

Jacob holding a cross made out of two sticks and reciting
appropriate verse from the bible is keeping the vampires at
bay But as Seth predicted it is the shining power of his
restored faith that is his mightiest weapon Jacob is making
his way through the vampires toward the back door A lot of
the bats have transformed into batdevilhuman creatures

The creatures stand at the edge of Jacobs force field of
holiness Many bat things fly around the bar like mad
whirling dervishes A cluster of bat-things over above and
in front of Jacob They all growl and hiss at the man of
god For every one step forward Jacob takes the vampire
stake one step back Jacob recites the verse from the bible
in a threatening mean mother fucking servant of god tone
As he speaks with authority and strength he sees Frost
lying on the ground bat-things on him like ants ona

candy bar But Jacob is too much in control to let even this
repugnant sight trip him up

Jacob has backed himself up by the door

JACOB
Open the door

The door FLIES open Jacob jumps inside The door SLAMS
shut

Jacob hugs daughter and son As he hugs them we see his
bloody arm

When he releases them they cant help but notice

SETH
Did he

JACOB
Yep

Seth explodes knocking over boxes busting chairs tipping
over tables and cussing a blue streak

SETH
Fuck piss shit Mother fuckin
vampires Mother fuckin vampires
Goddamn mother fuckin vampires

Seth runs over to the barricaded door and yells to the
creatures on the other side

SETH
You all are gonna fuckin die Im
gonna fuckin kill every last one of
you godless pieces of shit

JACOB
(to Seth)
You bet your sweet ass you are and
Im gonna help you do it But we aint
got much time

Kate is crying she knows whats happened to her father

KATE
Youre gonna be okay arent you
daddy

JACOB

No Im not Ive been bit In effect
Im already dead

Scott and Kate crying grab their father and hold on for
dear life Jacob wants to cry but if he breaks down the
kids will never have the courage for what they must do

JACOB

(to his children)
Children listen to me I love you two
more than anybody And I just want you
to know youve made me proud all your
lives But never more so than tonight
And I wish we could sit here and cry
till I pass on but we cant Because
Im not going to pass on Im going to
turn into a monster And when I do
Im going to be dangerous But before
that happens just know I love you

(to Seth and the kids)
Now Id say in the next twenty or
thirty minutes our friends outside
will bust in this door And Ill
probably turn into a vampire within
the hour Now you have two choices
You can wait for me to turn then deal
with me then wait for them to burst
inside here and the three of you will
deal with them Or we can kick open
that door and the four of us can hit
em with everything we have and carve
a path right through em to front
entrance But if were gonna go at â€˜em
we gotta go at em now I confused
them I scared them I took them off
guard But theyre going to get
unconfused theyre going to get
unscared theyre going to get
together and theyre going to hit that
door like a ton of bricks And when
that moment arrives we gotta be
ready

Jacob sees that the back room is pretty damn big and filled
with boxes and crates

JACOB
Whats this stuff

SETH
My guess is that this little dives
been feeding on nomad road waifs like
bikers and truckers for a longtime
This is probably some of the
shipments they stole off the trucks

JACOB
Well I say lets tear this place apart
for weapons So when they burst
through that door well make em wish
they never did

SETH
I dont give a shit about living or
dying anymore I just want to send as
many of these devils back to hell as
I can

JACOB
Amen

MONTAGE

The survivors are opening boxes and prying open crates A
lot of what they find is bullshit Pantyhose coffee
teddy bears etc But a few of the boxes are just what the
doctor ordered Cases from a sporting good supplier yield
a shipment of baseball bats Meant to arrive at toy stores
are a shipment of Uzi replica squirt guns and a box of
balloons And captured en route to a hardware store are
shipments of power tools saws and jack hammers
Seth and Scott saw the bats into wooden stakes

Kate fills the Uzi squirt guns with tap water from the
backroom sink

Jacob with Seths knife etches a cross into every bullet
in the 45 automatics last full clip of ammo

Vampires all start converging on the back room door
getting their courage back

Kate makes water balloons

Scott sharpens the stakes to a point with the tools Seth
attaches a wooden stake to the end of a jackhammer

Jacob blesses the water in the squirt guns and balloons
turning it into holy water

Our heroes work together preparing for the battle to come
The back room door barricaded with crates and boxes
begins to be pounded on by the undead on the other side
The room tone is a combination of chewing scratching
pounding squeaking and screaming

Finally theyre ready
Jacob turns to his kids

JACOB
Before we go any further I need you
three to promise me something Ill
fight with you to the bitter end
but when I turn into one of them I
wont be Jacob anymore Ill bea
lap dog of Satan I want you three to
promise youll take me down no
different from the rest

The kids cant say the words

SETH
I promise

JACOB

KATE

SCOTT

JACOB

(he picks up the 45)

just kill myself right now Now
since you need me I think you better

undead youll kill me

Kate doesnt answer Jacob places the 45 barrel against his
temple

JACOB

KATE
Okay okay I promise Ill do it

JACOB

JACOB
Thank you son

SETH
Okay vampire killers lets kill some
fuckin vampires

INT BARROOM - NIGHT

The vampires bat-things and what have you start BREAKING
down the door They are in a mad frenzy They burst through
the door

Waiting for them are Scott and Kate holding Uzi squirt guns
and water balloons draped down their chests on a belt like
grenades Jacob is holding a cross made of sharp wooden
stakes and the 45 with the cross bullets Seth is holding
the jackhammer The survivors walk out of the back room
into the bar The vamps back up letting them inside

What we have here is a Mexican standoff a la The Wild
Bunch A moment of peace before the battle The vamps just
watch the humans The humans just watch the vamps Then
like the bull in the china shop Seth ends the peace by
starting up the jackhammer

SETH
Kill em all

Jacob holds up the cross the vamps react

The kids SPRAY the crowd with UZI fire burning vampire
flesh

The pack of vamps retreat while the Fuller squad walk
forward

They are attacked on all sides but they keep moving towards
the door

Seth slams the stakes into several of the vamps it speeds
in and out of vampire chests each time spraying him in
green vamp blood

Jacob shoves his cross stake into a vampire with one hand
and SHOOTS three vampires with blessed bullets with the
other
Flame BURSTS from the vampires chests when the bullets hit

Kate and Scott both whip water balloons off their belts and
toss them into the crowd

They burst and FRY several of the vamps who fall screaming
in pain

From its perch on a wood ceiling beam a bat-thing drops and
HURLS toward the group

Jacob sees it raises his gun and FIRES
The bat-thing bursts into a ball of screaming fire

Seth continues carving a path to the front door by slamming
the hammer stake into vampire chests

The front door is barricaded again by a big table and other
junk

SCOTT
(yelling)
Why did they block the door again

JACOB
(yelling)
To keep the daylight out This is
where they sleep Get to the door

Seth tries to get to the front door when Sex Machine now a
half bat half devil vamp about six foot seven drops from
above in front of him Seth RAMS the stake in its chest The
Sex Machine-thing screams out LIFTING the hammer and Seth
off the ground

Seth is thrown from his hold on the hammer across the room
he CRASHES into a table

The Sex Machine-thing falls back with the jackhammer
sticking out of his chest dead

Kate spraying Uzi fire like Rambo sees Seth fall She
screams

KATE
Seth

Seth quickly gets up to find himself surrounded by vampires
on all sides With no weapons he puts up on dukes

SETH
Okay dead boys come on Take a bite
and feel all right

Kate clusters with her father and Scott

KATE
(yelling)
Im going for â€˜em
JACOB
No
KATE

Everybody goes home

Kate turns into a squirt gun firing water-balloon throwing
one-woman army as she breaks from her father and heads in
Seths direction

KATE
(screaming)
Die monster die Die monster die

Kate mows down the group by Seth they lie on the floor
burning in agony Kate takes Seths hand and gives hima
couple of water balloons and a stake

KATE
(to Seth)
Watch my back

SETH
Anytime

Cutting through vampires the two make their way across the
bar

Jacob firing the 45 takes out several more vampires in
fiery death

Scott fires the Uzi and chucks more water balloons

As Jacob fights all of a sudden the sound goes out He
cant hear anything He wonders if hes gone deaf He starts
to hear the words Thirst thirst thirst He notices the
vampires have stopped attacking him They look at him wit
happy smiles on their devilish faces Fangs begin to grow
His eyes are yellow

Scott turns to his dad He sees his father is a monster

Jacob with a devilish grin on his face GRABS Scott and
sinks his teeth into Scotts forearm Scott screams bloody
murder as his dad begins to drain him of blood

Scott takes one of the water balloons hes wearing and
SMASHES it against Jacobs head

The holy water melts half of Jacobs face away He lets go
of Scott screaming and drops the 45 on the floor

Scott drops to the ground picking up the gun He brings it
up to fire

A totally evil Jacob with only half a face matches stares
with the boy he once called his son

Scotts eyes turn to steel

SCOTT
I swear to God in Jesus Christs
name

He FIRES sending a holy bullet into Jacobs forehead
creating a hole from which fire shoots out Jacobs entire

head bursts into flames then explodes

From across the room Fate sees her daddy ignite She
cries out In the thick of the battle Seth yells

SETH
Fight now cry later

Kate takes his advice and hits a vamp square in the face
with a holy water balloon which melts his head

A bat-thing lands on the back of Scotts neck He screams as
it bites into him He drops the 45

Kate sees Scott get bit

KATE
Oh my god

Another bat-thing lands on Scotts arm and takes a bite
Scott screams

KATE
You bastards

She goes to spray them when her Uzi runs out of water

Now seven bat-things are on Scott biting and sucking blood
Scott is in agony
SCOTT
Kill me Kate

Kate runs for her brother does a DIVE and a ROLL coming
up by the 45 SNATCHING it in one motion and FIRING three
times

One two three bat-things are hit shoot flames then
all of them EXPLODE BLOWING UP Scott

The remaining vamps approach

All the humans have left is a few bullets and one holy
balloon

SETH
How many bullets left kid

KATE
Not many

SETH
Well when you run out of weapons
just start cold cocking em Make
sing for their supper

em

The two survivors are backed up against a wall Two bat
things do a Kamikaze dive from the air toward Seth Seth
throws the holy balloon at them Direct hit The two
bat-things burst into flames and spiral to the floor

The two survivors look at the vampires who stand before
them A moment of stillness before the attack Kate stands
holding the 45 arm outstretched

KATE
(to Seth)
Should I use the last bullets on us

SETH
You use em on the first couple of
these parasites that try to bite you

The vamps begins to close in Kate lines up the 45 sights
on the face of an approaching vampire

Seth holds the Uzi like a club ready to bash in the first
vampires head that gets in swinging distance

Beams of sunlight shoot through the holes that Kate shot
through the wall Approaching vampires burn The scorched
vamps scream like theyve never screamed before

SETH
Shoot more holes

Kate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall
behind him Daylight comes through providing Kate and
Seth with a safe lighted area

The 45s empty

The vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being
able to get at them

The two survivors hold hands when

All of a sudden the door to the Titty Twister is pounded on
from the outside

The vamps look towards it in horror

From the other side of the door we hear a voice with a
Spanish accent

VOICE (0S)
(in Spanish)

there

SETH
(yelling)
Carlos
(in Spanish)

in

CARLOS (0S)
(in Spanish)

Danny Manny knock down the door

Hurry hurry
The vamps are totally fucking freaked out They run and fly
around the bar in a panic Crying howling grabbing onto
each other
The front door is TORN apart from shotgun fir coming from
the outside punching holes the size of basketballs in the
door

he table in front of the door gives and FALLS forward

he door caves in and sunlight invades the bar Many vamps
are instantly fried bursting into flames

The Mexican gangster CARLSO and his two henchmen DANNY and
MANNY are horrified at what they see They cross themselves
in fright

Vampires search for dark corners but all is lost Sunlight
hits a mirrored ball attached to the ceiling sending
hundreds of beams of sunlight scattering through the room
Vamps try and dodge the beams No dice All around the vamps
combust in fiery explosions

The Titty Twister is now on fire burning out of control

Seth and Kate run through the building and leap through the
door into the parking lot

EXT TITTY TWISTER PARKING LOT - MORNING

Carlos Danny and Manny help them to their feet and walk
them away from the blazing bar They catch their breath by
Carloss Mercedes

CARLOS
(to Seth)
What the fuck was going on in there

Seth signals Carlos to wait a minute while he catches his
breath Then he hauls off and PUNCHES Carlos square in the
kisser Danny and Manny aim their shotguns at Seth

CARLOS
