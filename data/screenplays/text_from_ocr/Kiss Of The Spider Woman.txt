EXT HARBOR - DAY

The South American harbor is crammed with freight ships
DOCKWORKERS climb the ramps with bags of coffee beans
Cranes unload boxes of Japanese coffeemakers

CUT TO
EXT BAR DISTRICT - DAY

The narrow street is lined with garish bars Half-nude
HOOKERS lean over balconies and call down to passing
SHIPMATES More hookers escaping the tropical heat
sit in doorways and fan themselves to the Salsa MUSIC
from all the bars

CUT TO
INT RESTAURANT PATIO - DAY

Tapping to the music are a mans feet in sandals and a
gold ankle chain His linen trousers are rolled up in
the heat Dyed in his silk shirt are small faces of
Rita Hayworth

He is LEWIS MOLINA 58 an American who has lived here
since jumping ship at 19 His hair is tinted to hide

the gray He has the weathered face of a man who has

seen it all and been hurt by most of it

As the camera moves from his feet to his face we hear
Molina reading in a rather effeminate voice

MOLINA
He says he cant come back for
Christmas like he promised and
hes very sorry he hasnt seen his
new son yet and he loves you
with all his heart

Spread across his table are envelopes and stamps A
WOMAN of the district listens to him with quiet dignity
She has a baby on her lap and a four-year-old boy at her
side

WOMAN
So he wont come at all this year

WOMAN (CONTD)
(holds back tears)
What about money for the children

MOLINA
Sorry

He doesnt say

(turns to bar)
Gabriel Did you forget my iced
tea
(turns to woman)
Do you want to write him back

The woman is too sad to answer The boy fiddles with
his Star Wars toy Molina moistens a pen with his tongue
and begins to write

MOLINA
Dear Peter the boys and I were
delighted to get your thoughtful
card

A ship horn BLARES over the music As Molina writes we
see the interior of his hang-out and office

The restaurant is divided by a folding partition painted
with jungle leaves and spider webs One side is a bar
with weary dockworkers The other side is a modest dining
room with SHIPS OFFICERS at clean tablecloths

GABRIEL 35 a handsome waiter in a tunic moves through

the tables with a tray of dirty dishes His well-dressed
WIFE waiting impatiently at the kitchen window resumes

her harangue

WIFE
I told you last week the deadline
is today If we dont pay by 530
the girls will miss a whole
semester

Saying nothing Gabriel puts an iced tea on his tray

Gabriel approaches Molinas table on the patio Molina
glances up with a smile

GABRIEL

so long

MOLINA

(returns to letter)
Remember dearest Peter I am your
woman who misses you more than
life itself who lives only for
the blessed moment of your return
I save all my love for you alone
Your beloved --

(looks up)

What was your name darling

WOMAN
Please Senhor Molina I will
sign my own name

Molina is miffed

MOLINA
Okay If you think thats better

The woman pays the fee and leaves Gabriel waiting
nearby looks uneasy as he leans forward

GABRIEL
Molina could I ask you a small
favor Its only a hundred For
my kids school (indicates wife)
She has the money but she says a
father should provide these things

Molina takes out a hundred leaving only twenty for
himself Gabriel accepts it with grateful dignity

time Proud soldiers march along
the broad avenues in a magnificent
Parade of Liberation

CUT TO
EXT PARIS - DAY

The Parisian skyline SOUNDS of crowds military drums
marching troops

VOICE OF MOLINA
The air is charged with excitement
as they march under the Arch of
Triumph

PAN DOWN the Arch of Triumph to reveal columns of NAZI
TROOPS

VOICE OF MOLINA
Wearing their marvelous uniforms
So perfect so clean Battalions
of totally blonde invincible
supermen

Through a series of shots we move from the parade to an
average French working-class neighborhood

The images look like a slapdash German film of the 1940s
More specifically a Nazi propaganda movie

VOICE OF MOLINA
Forget what you read in the history
books The truth is the French
welcomed the Germans with open
arms

As two FRENCHMEN unload a truck at a hardware store a
NAZI CONVOY appears German troops arrest the two men
and find others hiding in the cellar One is shot trying
to escape the others surrender They are Jews
VOICE OF MOLINA
Oh there were a few who didnt
appreciate them but for the most
part the French cheered because
they were saving France from
disaster and starvation

A neighborhood crowd spits on the smugglers German
troops break open the cargo and distribute the contraband

food

A grateful OLD WOMAN kisses Werners hand

A pickup truck stops in an alley and watches the crowd

VOICE OF MOLINA
A small truck watches from nearby
Inside are these two French thugs
from the Resistance The driver
is a hulking cross-eyed Flunky
His boss is a grimy little Clubfo
Their truck is loaded with
delicacies like canned meats and
cognac These Resistance goons
are shameless black-marketeers
Simply shameless

A narrow beach stretches between the ocean and the dense
Jungle

VOICE OF MOLINA
She wore a long sleek dress of
silver lame that fit her like a
glove But the poor thing couldnt
move through the jungle forest
because she was caught in a giant
spider web which grew from her own
body

The camera slithers past lush plants and exotic creatures
until we SEE barely visible in the dense foliage the
SPIDER WOMAN in her web

VOICE OF MOLINA
One day a shipwrecked man drifted
onto the beach

The SHIPWRECKED MAN topples out of a water-logged rowboat
onto the sandy beach
