INT WINNIPEG PASSPORT CONTROL - DAY

There’s a line of about a hundred people Wallace is directed
to an open window to a waiting BORDER AGENT

BORDER AGENT
What brings you to Manitoba

WALLACE
A bed and breakfast

BORDER AGENT
They don’t have beds and breakfast
in America anymore

WALLACE
I’m reviewing this one for a
podcast

BORDER AGENT
See now I’ve been hearing lots
about these pot-casts from the
younger kids What is it

WALLACE
Podcasts They’re like home-grown
radio shows Anyone can do ‘em
Mine’s called “Pillow Pants” Its
a travelogue I go out and see the
world then I come home and tell my
shut-in friend all about it

BORDER AGENT
Is he crippled

WALLACE
Uhm No I mean Emotionally
maybe He’s kind of a ‘fraidy-cat

BORDER AGENT
And youre Mister Bravey Beaver
are ya’

WALLACE
(bemused )
Is that what they call it up here

BORDER AGENT
No
(hands him back his stuff)
Welcome to Canada
EXT QUAINT WINNIPEG HOME - DAY

A rental car pulls up and we hear the faint sound of an
obnoxious smart phone ring tone (Aw Aw Aw Ooo-ah Ooo-ah
CMON NOW MORE MARGHARITAS) We can see Wallace check his
phone not answer it and put it in his pocket Finally
Wallace gets out of the car and approaches the house with his
bag in hand climbing up the porch steps

EXT PORCH OF QUAINT WINNIPEG HOME - SAME

Wallace knocks on the front door No answer He locates the
doorbell and rings it No answer

INT QUAINT WINNIPEG HOME - SAME

Were looking at Wallace who’s peering through the window
knocking

WALLACE
Hello

EXT PORCH OF QUAINT WINNIPEG HOME - SAME
Wallace stops knocking He turn to face the street
perplexed He leaves his bag on the porch and heads into the

street looking up at the house

WALLACE (CONTD)
Hello

VOICE OF NEIGHBOR
Hello there yourself young fella

Wallace turns to see a NEIGHBOR exiting his yard closing his
gate behind him greeting Wallace with an envelope

NEIGHBOR
They’re not home

WALLACE
Excuse me

NEIGHBOR

The McKenzies hadda go oot of town

WALLACE
Are you shittin’ me

NEIGHBOR
Oh an American Isn’t that
something Welcome to Canada

The Neighbor hands Wallace an envelope
NEIGHBOR (CONTD)
Mrs McKenzie told me to keep an
eye oot for you and when you got
here I’s to give you this

Wallace opens the envelope and quietly reads the letter

WALLACE
No No no n’oh man

Wallace shakes his head way too frustrated He kicks his
suit case pissed off After a beat he says to Neighbor

WALLACE (CONTD)
Your neighbors are swingers okay
I don’t wanna be a tattle-tale
but I only came to Canada just
so I can have a story about
swinging with Canadians And they
left I flew a couple thousand
miles to have sex with strangers
and now they’re not even home

(unable to spreak ‘til)
I’m sorry I’m just really pissed
off Where the fuck could they have
possibly gone

NEIGHBOR
Mrs McKenzie’s Mom had a massive
heart attack last night So

Wallace shuts up feeling like a dick The Neighbor stands
there for an awkward beat Then

NEIGHBOR (CONTD)
Anyway I delivered the letter

The Neighbor shrugs and lumbers back to his house leaving
Wallace alone in the middle of the street

INT BAR - NIGHT

ON A LAPTOP SCREEN we see an Orbitz-type travel web site
LOS ANGELES is typed in a destination window

Wallace and his suitcase are sitting at the bar He swigs his
beer waiting for travel search results Older patrons play
darts behind him as Wallce selects a number on his smart
phone and presses send He checks the laptop screen again
Then via the phone we hear

PHONE VOICE
A my name is Ally L leave a
message
WALLACE

(after the beep)
Heeeyyy It’s me I’m in Winnipeg
In a bar called

(checks napkin)
“Bar H”

(sighs then)
I was thinking about what you said
yesterday and I’m not gonna go
through with it I’m not gonna
swing with the swingers I didn’t
even go to their house I was on
the plane and I realized This is
love I got a 24 karat case of
love For you Call me back

Wallace ends the call After a beat he hits another number

TEDDY MESSAGE VO
(voice mail)
This is Teddy Gimme head-y

WALLACE

(leaving message)
Hey man The swinger thing was an
epic fail I got no sex no story
just nothing So pissed right
now Anyway I’m sitting in a bar
looking for a flight home but I
feel like I gotta find something
weird to do while I’m up here
yknow I can’t come all this way
and then go home empty-handed
There’s gotta be something kooky in
Canada - something so fucked up
it’ll save this trip If I find it
I’1l call you ‘til then this is
me signing off from the Great
White North

To end the call he sings the Coo loo coo coo coo coo coo
coo of Bob and Doug McKenzie

INT BAR BATHROOM - NIGHT

Wallace drags his suitcase into the bathroom with him and
sidles up to a urinal Above the urinal is a community
corkboard with all manner of shit pinned to it for the
discerning reader taking a leak the sports page a few Help
Wanted ads some Rooms For Rent flyers etc

As he pisses Wallace looks up at the cork board taking it
all in Then he spies something unique pinned to the board
WALLACE’S POV THE HAND-WRITTEN WORD ADVENTURE
It’s there hidden under too many postings over postings

Wallace moves some of the stapled bar theme night ads and
newspaper clippings to reveal a handwritten handbill

Different than everything else stuck to the corkboard it is
as if the handbill is from another better age Care was put
into this document Across the top of the paper in larger
letters A LIFE OF ADVENTURE WITH STORIES TO TELL

Wallace is intrigued He peers closer at the paper above the
urinal reading the flawless cursive as we hear a VO

A LIFE OF ADVENTURE
Hello I am an old man who has
enjoyed a long and storied life at
sea From the Fjords of Norway to
the Bering Strait I am a proud
Canadian who has traveled a
peculiar path lo’ these many years

Wallace zips up and keeps reading

A LIFE OF ADVENTURE (CONT’D)
And after eons of oceanic
adventure I find myself a land-
lubber with Manitoba as my final
port But as a shipwreck survivor
who once spent six months with no
human contact I know I do not wish
to spend my remaining years alone
in a giant house willed to me by a
grandfather I never knew Not when
I have such stories to share

Wallace takes the ad off the pin-board
EXT 7-11 - NIGHT

From outside the convenience store we can see Wallace on his
phone as carries a Big Gulp to the counter

WALLACE
Tonight would be amazing sir
Thank you yes Where am I going

Wallace starts miming to the CLERK that he needs a pen and
paper The Clerk obliges while ringing up Wallace’s order
Wallace writes down an address rips off the paper and hands
the pad and pen back to the Clerk asking
WALLACE (CONT’D)
How far is Bifrost from here

CLERK
Bifrost near Morweena Two hour

WALLACE
(into phone)
Guy here says I’m two hours away
You sure it’s not too late for you
(beat smiles)
I will Thank you

EXT WINNIPEG HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Wallace’s rental car tools down the empty highway - no
headlights coming at him none behind him

TEDDY MESSAGE VO
(voice mail)
This is Teddy Gimme head-y

INT CAR - SAME
Wallace drives barking into his cell after the beep

WALLACE
It’s me I think I got something
better than the swingers dude But
do me a favor go back into next
week’s show and pull out that shit
I said about Allison being jealous
please I don’t need the headache

He hangs up and sips on his Big Gulp glancing at the GPS on
the dash which indicates 50 miles from the destination
Beside it is the handbill We hear the rest of the text

A LIFE OF ADVENTURE AD (VO)
So to this end Im offering a room
for rent in my stately woodland
home This arrangement will be free
of charge providing you perform
the simple household chores I can
no longer tend to from the confines
of this cursed wheelchair menial
tasks I used to do for myself ‘til
age robbed me of the simplest
pleasures But though I may be old
I HAVE LIVED I watched Saigon
fall I made love in an African sex
colony And I will tell you all
about my many adventures in vivid
detail
Wallace smiles at this notion

EXT MANITOBA HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The rental car whips over us speeding into the night

EXT RURAL MANITOBA ROAD - LATER

A full moon overhead is about the only light available beyond
Wallace’s headlights The rental slows at what looks like a
long dark driveway in the woods

INT CAR - SAME

The GPS on the dash indicates we’ve got about another mile
Wallace peers out his windshield at the dark driveway

EXT RURAL MANITOBA ROAD - SAME

The rental car turns down the dark driveway and darkness
swallows all but the vehicle’s tail lights

EXT BIFROST WOODS - SAME
The rental travels a wooded trail that’s more path than road
INT CAR - SAME

Wallace peers into the darkness looking for his destination
When Wallace sees the house we hear

GPS VOICE
You have arrived at destination

WALLACE’S POV THE MANSION IN THE WOODS

They don’t make ‘em like this anymore A porch light goes on
acting as a beacon in the darkness

EXT BIFROST WOODS - SAME

The rental car drives past a stone monument overgrown with
weeds but still legible It reads CHAPEL HILL

EXT CHAPEL HILL - SAME

We’re on the big porch looking out at Wallace’s car as it
slowly pulls toward us Then in the foreground a wheelchair
rolls into view We’re over the shoulder of an older man

INT CAR - SAME

Now we’re over Wallace’s shoulder looking at the Man in the
Wheelchair on the welcoming porch
EXT CHAPEL HILL - SAME
Push in on the OLD MAN IN THE WHEELCHAIR

Though he’s surrounded by trees and forest he calls to mind
(in demeanor and dress) a dignified 19th century sea captain -
like Rex Harrison in The Ghost and Mrs Muir He’s well-
groomed Effete almost But the lines in his face tell a

tale of a life lived to the fullest

Balanced on the arms of his chair is a serving tray complete
with a pot of tea and two tea cups

The car stops Wallace climbs out of the car with his Super
Big Gulp smiling up at the Man

WALLACE
Mister Howe

HOWE
Howard

WALLACE
Mister Howard

HOWE

(chuckles)

It’s always a French bedroom farce

when people get entangled with my

name for the first time
(extending hand)

Howard Howe And while “Mister

Howe” is absolutely appropriate I

prefer the intimacy of Howard

WALLACE
Howard

HOWE
Smashing And with that
unpleasantness out of the way may
I welcome you to Chapel Hill
(extending tea cup)
Would you like some tea

WALLACE
I would But first
(showing empty Big Gulp)
Can I use your bathroom

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Wallace stands above the toilet taking a loooo0000000ng
piss He looks around at the bathroom decor
WALLACE’S POV THE WATER CLOSET DECOR
It resembles Ye Old Curiosity Shoppe in Seattle

Bizarre oddities and images of things that shouldn’t be are
fixed to the walls of the tiny room from floor to ceiling

Over here a giant set of shark jaws Over there a Zuni
fetish doll There’s an antique photo of a man and a native
tribe with a killed native hung upside down beside him

Wallace looks more closely at this Yep the man in the photo
shot and killed a native Wallace raises his eyebrows at this
until something else catches his attention

WALLACE’S POV THE TOILET PAPER DOLL

There’s a knitted toilet paper cozy that’s designed to look
like a dress being worn by the doll standing in the roll

The doll’s glassy eyes seem to stare back at Wallace - which
unnerves him Since he’s standing pissing the doll’s at
crotch height seemingly watching him urinate Bothered
Wallace turns the doll around to face the wall instead

EXT BATHROOM - NIGHT
Wallace exits the bathroom

HOWE
(from another room)
In here Mister Brighton

Wallace heads toward the fireplace-lit room passing all
manner of dead creatures of the sea mounted on the wall each
kept life-like through taxidermy

INT STUDY - SAME

Wallace enters to find Mister Howe pulled up to a small table
with an empty chair beside it He sips his tea as the fire
crackles behind him Above the fireplace is what appears to
be a long bone-like branch mounted with care

HOWE (CONT’D)
All better

WALLACE
Thank you
HOWE
My second wife used to say “Rather
saint than sin Better out than
in” Of course she was talking
about gas

WALLACE
Ah Of course

HOWE

(pouring tea)
Dear Lord that woman was the most
flatulent creature God ever
created And I say that having
spent at one point in my youth a
summer tending cattle It was like
living with a tuba player who could
only blow one foul note

(handing him tea)
Did you find the water closet
satisfactory

WALLACE
(takes tea)
Yes thank you so much I was
holding it for half the ride

HOWE
Our selection of trees didn’t tempt
you inner canine

WALLACE
(looking at the wall art)
I was a little too spooked to get
out of the car in the middle of
nowhere

HOWE
Never be ashamed of fear Mister
Brighton Fear is the unelected
governor that keeps our actions
moral

WALLACE
Who said that

HOWE
I did Just now
(sips tea then)
So I must say that your phone call
intrigued me

WALLACE
Well

Wallace pulls the bathroom ad from his pocket

WALLACE (CONTD)
Your handbill intrigued me

HOWE
But did I understand you correctly
on the phone You’re not looking
for a living arrangement

WALLACE
No I live in Los Angeles

HOWE
Oh my Lord The City of Angels

WALLACE
Well I’ve never seen any myself
More the opposite really

HOWE
Devils are a dime a dozen My
Grandma Mimsy would tell us “One
neednt go very far to find Hell in
a hand basket”

WALLACE
My Grandma used to say “Hell is
your children

HOWE
How droll What an interesting
woman she must’ve been eh

WALLACE

Now she was flatulent

(off the wall contents)
She hung lots of stuff on her
walls too - just like you But
nothing as interesting

(pointing to painting)
What’s this

HOWE
(squints to see)
That’s the only known eyewitness
painting of the Halifax Explosion

WALLACE
Right on

HOWE
You haven’t the foggiest notion
what that is have you

WALLACE
(smiles caught)
No

HOWE
It was the largest man-made
explosion on earth before the
atomic bomb The catastrophe
happened long before I was even
born on December 6 1917 A French
cargo ship loaded with wartime
explosives - the SS Mont-Blanc -
collided with the Norwegian vessel
Imo in a strait off the Halifax
Harbour The fire on board the
French craft ignited her deadly
cargo and set off a cataclysmic
explosion that devastated the Nova
Scotian city 2000 people were
killed 9000 others were injured

WALLACE
Oh my God

HOWE
So intense was the blast that the
resulting tsunami wiped out the
Mi’kmaw First Nations people whod
lived around Tufts Cove for
centuries A mighty ancient people
incinerated and drowned by a
mightier and very modern boom
White or dark-skinned the
explosion failed to discriminate
The Mont-Blanc was atomized by
temperatures of five thousand
degrees White-hot shards of iron
rained down on Halifax for ten
minutes and the harbour floor was
briefly exposed by the sheer volume
of instantly vaporized water

WALLACE
And the person who painted this was
actually there when it happened

HOWE
I’m afraid no one who was there
when it happened lived to tell the
tale The artist was a member of
the Fire Brigade from neighboring
Dartmouth who was among the first
on the scene one hour after
detonation

Howe points to a detail in the picture

HOWE (CONT’D)
Look closely at the standing
buildings nearest the harbor Do
you see the windows

WALLACE
Are those dead bodies hanging out
of the windows

HOWE

Yes Some are even headless You
see everyone in town heard that
two ships had collided And nobody
knew the Mont-Blanc was not only
pregnant with a lethal cargo but
also moments from ignition - so
people were hanging out of their
windows staring at the sea when the
blast struck Even my grandparents
And my Father would have certainly
been killed that day along with his
parents had they not sent him to
boarding school a week prior

(off painting)
So every day I look at this image
and think how close I came to never
even being born And it makes me
thankful to still be alive
decrepit though I may be

WALLACE
Wow You can spin a helluva yarn
Mister Howe

HOWE
Please It’s Howard

Howe rolls his wheelchair along the wall as he orates
allowing better views of his collection

HOWE (CONTD)

My life lines these walls Mister
Brighton So every day I study the
walls as a reminder that I have
survived the long and treacherous
journey to the security of this
house and this chair And while I
cannot boast of functioning legs to
keep me ambulatory the Lord has
seen fit to at least leave me with
a working memory so that I can
relive all of my many adventures

WALLACE
(sitting)
And it’s those adventures I’m
interested in Mister Howe

HOWE
Howard On the phone you said you
weren’t so much interested in the
room as you were me personally

WALLACE
Yes I saw this
(pulls post from pocket)
I’m only in town for the night and
your ad really captured my

imagination

HOWE
Oh

WALLACE

You talked about sharing stories
Well I’m a story-teller by trade

HOWE
Youre a writer

WALLACE
I’m a podcaster

HOWE
Good Lord what on earth is that

WALLACE
It’s kinda of a radio show that’s
not on the radio It sounds like

INT PODCAST STUDIO - DAY

Studio is a generous term The walls are filled with framed
posters and artwork promoting a podcasting duo called PILLOW
PANTS Each piece depicts the podcast hosts in various comic
interpretations a’la comedy record covers Some advertise
old live appearances some are framed awards from
Stitchercom some boast of iTunes podcast chart placement

WALLACE (0C) (CONT’D)
So I’m asleep in my hotel room and
I get woke up by this rumbling
outside my door

TEDDY (0C)
And it was the Rapture

WALLACE (0C)
I wish I’m not religious but I
wanna be with Jesus If he can turn
a bottle of wine into a thousand
bottles of wine who knows what
kinda magic he can work with weed

TEDDY (0C)
It all comes back to weed with you

Finally reveal WALLACE wearing headphones smoking a joint
barking into a microphone

WALLACE
So I get up and look through the
peep-hole and the guy across the
hall ordered so much room service
it took six cockadoody carts to
deliver all that shit

TEDDY
Was he having a party

WALLACE
That’s what I thought ‘cause if he
was I was ready to crash
INT HOTEL ROOM - BLACK and WHITE FLASHBACK
Story-Wallace peers through his peephole as Wallace narrates
WALLACE (VO)
So I was trying to see who answered
the door all staring through the
peep-hole watching like a creepy
fuckin’ podiatrist

BLACK and WHITE FLASHBACK WALLACE’S POV 6 carts and 6 Bell-Men
block our fish-eye view of the hallway through the peephole

TEDDY (VO)
Podiatrist

WALLACE (VO)
Like TO CATCH A PREDATOR

INT PODCAST STUDIO - DAY
Teddy chuckles correcting the smoking Wallace

TEDDY
Pederast

WALLACE
Whatd I say

TEDDY
“Foot doctor”

WALLACE
Well the guy who took out my
planter’s wart in high school was
an asshole so motherfuck a
podiatrist too

INT HOTEL ROOM - BLACK and WHITE FLASHBACK
Story-Wallace peers through his peephole as Wallace narrates

TEDDY (VO)
So who answered the door

WALLACE
Fucking midget

BLACKandWHITE FLASHBACK WALLACE’S POV A LITTLE PERSON

He barely sees over the room service cart as he answers the
door wearing the too-long-for-him complimentary hotel robe

TEDDY (VO)
No

WALLACE (VO)
One little guy six carts of food

INT PODCAST STUDIO - DAY
Teddy and Wallace wrap up their recording

TEDDY
And there it is folks Wallace
Goes Roamin’ in Ol’ Wyoming Id
like to thank this intrepid
motherfucker for going places and
seeing and doing things that lots
of us - me included - would never
do in a million years

WALLACE
I do it for shut-ins sir I do it
for all the legendary puss-holes
like you who’re too scared to live
the great adventure of life So
count on me to sniff out the shit
that’s more real than real and come
back to tell you all about it

TEDDY

Next week Mr More Real Than Real
heads up to Canada eh Look out
you crazy Canucks something weird-
ass this way comes A rowdy road
trip across the Great White North
with Wanderin’ Wallace Until then
this is Teddy Croft

WALLACE
And this is Wallace Brighton saying
it’s a big bad world out there so
put on your Pillow Pants

INT STUDY - NIGHT

Howe is chuckling like he’s trading in bawdy humor Wallace
nods shrugging

HOWE
You can actually say those things
without repercussions

WALLACE
The audience likes it real and
raunchy so I try to keep it real
and raunchy And real raunchy

HOWE
The freedoms your generation
enjoys

WALLACE

(sips his tea)
Can I just tell you how good this
tea is And I’m not a tea person

HOWE
We are all of us tea people But
the secret is to soak the leaves in
a bottle of brandy before steeping

WALLACE
You can’t lose with booze

HOWE
“Always do sober what youd do
drunk That will teach you to keep
your mouth shut”

WALLACE
Hemingway said that

HOWE
Yes he did To me

WALLACE
You knew Ernest Hemingway

HOWE
We met in Normandy

WALLACE
You were there for D-Day

HOWE
I was there before D-Day when it
was just called Operation Neptune

WALLACE
Holy You were on the beach

HOWE
I was on a boat As was Ernie - who
was deemed “precious cargo” by
those in charge and prohibited from
joining the incursion And this
vexed Monsieur Hemingway to say
the least You see he so enjoyed
hunting the big game The big
deadlies And what bigger deadlier
game than a Nazi Except perhaps a
Nazi’s nagging wife

Howard Howe let’s out a foppish laugh as if his comment was
the height of impropriety Wallace dutifully chuckles in
response sipping his tea

HOWE (CONTD)
So barred from joining the
invasion Hemingway went to the
kitchen in search of alcohol

INT SHIP’S KITCHEN - BLACK and WHITE FLASHBACK
Close on a young ERNEST HEMINGWAY in the kitchen doorway

A gangly wide-eyed TEENAGER alone in the kitchen with
mountains of potatoes and a peeler in hand stares at
Hemingway as he knocks down empty bowls

HOWE (VO) (CONT’D)
And the only soul in sight to
oblige him was a sixteen year old
potato peeler on KP duty

WALLACE (VO)
Get out of town

The Teenager pulls a secret bottle of Canadian Club from a
potato sack and hands it to Hemingway Hemingway smiles
uncorks and guzzles slapping the kid on the back

HOWE (VO)
I proffered for Hemingway a bottle
of Canadian Club - or CC as we
called it then And I’1l never
forget what he did next an
otherworldly smile crawled across
the man’s face so slowly it was as
if it wasn’t a smile so much as a
caterpillar Then he slapped me on
the back and declared me a “Kitchen
Witch of Only Good Fortune”

INT STUDY - NIGHT
Wallace is delighted by Howe’s historical tale

WALLACE
That’s just nuts man

HOWE
We drank CC in the kitchen and
from her porthole windows we
watched Hell in the surf And when
the reports came back of how many
boys died on Omaha that day
Hemingway said to me “Always do
sober what youd do drunk It will
teach you to keep your mouth shut”

WALLACE
That’s incredible sir

HOWE
No that’s just a story If you
look to the left of the fireplace
youll see the incredible aspect

Wallace gets out of his chair with just the slightest
detectable sway - so slight he doesn’t even recognize it
himself He rounds his chair as Howe turns his wheelchair to
face the fireplace

Inside a glass case affixed to the wall is an empty old
bottle of Canadian Club Wallace peers at it

WALLACE
This is the coolest thing I’ve ever
seen

HOWE

Oh it’s just an empty old bottle
But when combined with the story
Then it’s a powerful talisman - a
doorway to another time and place
A drawbridge to history

Wallace eyes the long bone-like branch mounted above the
fireplace He turns to Howe and asks

WALLACE
What’s this

HOWE

(wheeling over)
Ahhhh Just like me you’ve got an
eye for the unfamiliar and the
curiosity of a cat It will take
you very far in life

(stops chair)
That is the baculum of a walrus
The Alaskans call it an oosik

WALLACE
(running finger over it)
So it’s like a walrus spine

HOWE
More like a walrus cock

Wallace withdraws his hand Howe chuckles

HOWE (CONT’D)
Ooo I am a dirty boy arent I

WALLACE
This is a walrus dick

HOWE
No my dear boy The baculum is the
bone found in the penis of most
placental mammals but absent in
humans It is in aid of sexual
intercourse helping the animal
maintain sufficient stiffness
during coital penetration

WALLACE
You got something like this between
your legs you don’t need any help
with coital penetration Jesus
Those lucky fuckin’ walruses

HOWE
Canines have baculum as well
Felines raccoons In some
cultures the raccoon baculum is
worn as a charm for fertility

WALLACE
A boner-bringer

Howe giggles like a schoolboy tickled by the light smut

HOWE

You are a rapscallion of the
highest order Mister Brighton

(off the oosik)
But you are right to admire the
walrus It is the most noble of
Gods creatures - far more evolved
than any so-called human being I’ve
ever encountered Present company
excluded of course I try to speak
ill only of those out of ear-shot

WALLACE
(off oosik)
Where do you buy something like
this A head shop Ba-dum-bum

HOWE
I didn’t purchase this oosik One
could almost say this oosik
purchased me

WALLACE
“The wand chooses the wizard

HOWE
What a delightful expression I
shall add that to my collection of
things to say so as to distract
from my woeful stupidity and boring
demeanor

WALLACE
(throwing back tea)
I’ve met plenty of stupid Mister
Howe

HOWE
Howard

WALLACE
(pouring another tea)
Youre anything but stupid And
like the polar opposite of boring
(off oosik)
Did you used to hunt walruses

HOWE
Oh good Heavens no That would be
as senseless as hunting an Indian
Fakir or a tribal Medicine Man
There is a souvenir market for the
walrus oosik of course where they
can fetch anywhere from one hundred
to eight thousand dollars apiece
depending on the size and rarity
Utterly barbaric Can you imagine
another species hawking your John
Thomas as a conversation piece

WALLACE
Not mine But I got a friend who’s
hung like an oosik So maybe his

HOWE
(handing Wallace his tea)
You are a scandal Mister Brighton

Wallace smiles at the compliment and sips his tea anew Howe
wheels closer to the fireplace eyeing the oosik as Wallace
plops down in his chair

WALLACE
So where’d you come across the
walrus dick Pun intended

Howe blushes giggling Wallace chortles taking a swallow or
two of his tea

HOWE
This particular oosik belonged to a
walrus I became acquainted with
while lost at sea

Wallace stares at Howe for a beat Then

WALLACE
Youre kidding

HOWE
(wheeling back to him)
In 1959 I was back on a boat This
time in the Gulf of Anadyr on the
southern coast of the Siberian
Chukchi Peninsula

Wallace finishes his tea As he leans forward in his seat to
listen intently he appears a touch groggy

HOWE (CONTD)
These were perhaps the best years
of my life when my culinary
capabilities in small sea-faring
kitchens acted as my passport to
the world And it was my magic with
a halibut that earned me the cook’s
position on the Anastasia and her
expedition into Soviet waters

WALLACE
So is this like Cold War stuff

HOWE
We went in search of the legendary
Siberian Great White

WALLACE
A GREAT WHITE SHARK NO WAY

HOWE
“The Whale Eater” is what the
Russians called the hungry god -
reputed to be 25 feet in length
with at least three tons on him

WALLACE
Did you find it

HOWE
(smiles sadly)
We found only death Off the
Chukchi Peninsula in the inky
heart of the night the Anastasia
collided with an iceberg

EXT THE SEA AT NIGHT - BLACK and WHITE FLASHBACK

The slightly older less gangly Howe bursts from the water
gasping for air Fading lights flicker across his face

We’re over young Howe’s shoulder as he bobs treading water
watching the Anastasia sink into the sea in the distance

HOWE (VO)

The ship sank within minutes I
know because I watched her
disappear into the black Russian
sea I heard the crew’s screams
silenced in the Siberian brine

INT STUDY - NIGHT

As if on cue we hear some animal howling in the distance
Wallace raises his eyebrows Howe chuckles

HOWE
Delicious timing

WALLACE
(chuckles nervously then)
What happened after the boat sank

HOWE
I was alone
(reciting)
“Alone alone all all alone
Alone on a wide wide sea
And never a saint took pity on
My soul in agony”

WALLACE
The Rime of the Ancient Mariner

HOWE

Well-remembered Mister Brighton
When the screaming stopped I
thought I might be alone Until
something swam very close to me
Something fast and frightening

(reciting again)
“The many men so beautiful
And they all dead did lie
And a thousand thousand slimy
things lived on and so did I

WALLACE
(tired but engaged)
How scared were you when this was
all happening

HOWE
I don’t mind confessing I was
terrified You’ve likely been
scared many times in your life
Mister Brighton but I’d wager
youve never known true terror

Wallace’s eyelids droop a bit then go wide as Wallace tries
to stay awake

HOWE (CONT’D)
We are scared of what we don’t
know But terror That comes from a
sudden and unwanted knowledge of
the unknowable - even for a moment
And I became intimately familiar
with terror for hours that night
as I swam I kicked at the water
and stroked for I knew not where
It was so pitch black I could see
no eventual purchase on the horizon
for my weary wet bones Indeed I
did not even see my own hands as
they pierced the water over and
over All I could do was swim
deeper into the ebony void and pray
that whatever brushed my leg was
now feasting upon the rest of the
expedition crew instead And
then I lost consciousness

WALLACE
Sweet whistling Christ

HOWE
I woke up on the shores of a tiny
island regurgitating sea water
discombobulated beyond belief

EXT REMOTE BEACH - BLACK and WHITE FLASHBACK

Flashback Howe wakes in the surf the tide lapping at him He
looks around desperate semi-conscious

HOWE (VO)
But when I finally climbed to my
feet I saw the sweetest sight my
orbs have ever taken in I saw my
sweet savior - the Charon whod
escorted me across the River Styx

Then the younger soaked Howe goes soft when he sees
FLASHBACK WALLACE’S POV A WALRUS WITH TUSKS
He looks at us and snorts non-threateningly

HOWE (VO)
I saw a walrus

INT STUDY - NIGHT
Wallace leans forward in his chair delighted

WALLACE
A walrus No fucking WAY pardon my
French A walrus saved your life

HOWE
A walrus made my life Mister
Brighton Made it worth living
again

Wallace’s eyes droop closed and snap back open Howe’s voice
is like a hypnotic trance and whatever’s in the tea isn’t
helping matters Howe pours another cup for Wallace

HOWE (CONT’D)

This curious fellow loomed over me
with tusks as tall as Scylla and
Charibdys easily a thousand pounds
my better Yet he was as gentle as
a milking cow when he used his
blubbery body to keep me warm - as
if I were a newborn chick you see

WALLACE
Unbelievable

HOWE

And while I could never know how he
was addressed in his native tongue
amongst his marine brethren I
started calling him after the only
authority figure Id ever truly
trusted in my life a janitor at a
boy’s home where I spent some time
whose name was Mister Tuskegee

Howe hands Wallace the cup of tea smiling

HOWE (CONT’D)
So I called my walrus friend
Mister Tusk

WALLACE
Mister Tusk That’s cu cute

HOWE
Cute is for Chinese babies Mister
Brighton My walrus companion was
beautiful Never have I had such a
fulfilling friendship with anyone -
human or otherwise

Wallace is now noticing something’s wrong with him
WALLACE’S POV HOWE THROUGH FUCKED-UP EYES
It’s a drunk or drugged perspective of Howe speaking

HOWE (CONT’D)
And for six glorious months of my
life I was at utter peace - and I
knew the only bliss this wretched
life has ever afforded me

Wallace drops his tea cup and steadies himself in his chair
He struggles to stand and falls forward onto the floor

WALLACE
Whas Whatd you do

WALLACE’S POV HOWE HAS THE OOSIK IN HIS HANDS NOW

Still in his wheelchair Howe suddenly has the oosik from the
mantle laying across his lap

Wallace tries to scream but he can’t And as hard as he
fights it his body’s shutting down He struggles to get up
but gravity’s defeating his drugged system

Howe extends the oosik to Wallace on the floor grazing
Wallace’s face as he struggles to stay conscious

WALLACE’S POV DRUGGED AND DIMMING
The oosik dangles over us Beyond it in soft focus that’s
getting softer and darker by the second we see the old man
holding the oosik comforting us
The last thing we see is Howe saying softly
HOWE
There there It’1ll be all right

(beat)
Mister Tusk

FADE TO BLACK

INT PODCAST STUDIO - DAY
Teddy and Wallace wrap up the show

WALLACE
And this is Wallace Brighton saying
it’s a big bad world out there so

The pair are silent for a beat as Teddy stops the recorder

TEDDY
Clear
WALLACE
(standing)

That sucked

TEDDY
It was funny I’m shocked you got
anything out of trip to Wyoming

WALLACE
I used to find fucked up shit

hundred episodes it’s getting
harder And the coattail-riding
copycat doesn’t help either

TEDDY

WALLACE

WALLACE

TEDDY

WALLACE
A BandB run by a swinger couple

TEDDY
Oh Canada Close your legs eh

WALLACE
Wanna see a selfie of the happy
couple

Wallace scrolls through some photos on hid phone and hands it
to Teddy who promptly goes wide-eyed at what he sees

TEDDY’S POV AN ARTY SELFIE OF THE COUPLE

Both are standing and the guy holds the camera high to take a
pic of him and his lady The woman is turned away from
camera looking over her shoulder jutting her ass a bit
Sticking out of her ass is what looks like a fox tail

TEDDY
Is that a tail

WALLACE
That’s a faux-fox-tail butt-plug

TEDDY
Wowwwww

WALLACE
She says she’s got every kind of
animal tail they ever stuck on a
butt plug dog raccoon chicken

TEDDY
(hands phone back)
People are weird

WALLACE
Weirder’n you think

INT DARK ROOM - PRESENT
NOTE WE’RE IN WALLACE’S POV FOR THIS WHOLE SECTION

We FADE UP to a soft focus dimly lit view of a ceiling
Periodically a piece of someone comes in and out of the
frame as we hear (but don’t see) eloquent recitation of a
classic poem It’s almost sang it’s so lyrical

HOWE (0C)
The sun was shining on the sea
Shining with all his might

We hear Wallace groaning as if coming-to The soft focus
gets a little more crisp and we see a giant light from what
looks like an operating room overhead It’s on dim

HOWE (0C) (CONTD)
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright

WALLACE (0C)
(weakly)
H-- Hello

HOWE (0C)
And this was odd because it was

The overhead bulbs suddenly go hot blinding us with light

HOWE (0C) (CONTD)
The middle of the night

Our POV tries to look away but we’re locked in place

WALLACE
Uhnnn

As a recording winds to life the sound of seagulls fills the
room Beneath it we also hear the sounds of the surf

HOWE (0C)
The sea was wet as wet could be
The sands were dry as dry

WALLACE
Wh Whats goin’ on

HOWE (0C)
You could not see a cloud because
no cloud was in the sky
No birds were flying overhead
There were no birds to fly

WALLACE
‘the fuck is this

HOWE (0C)
“The time has come the Walrus
said To talk of many things
Of shoes and ships and sealing-wax
of cabbages and kings

WALLACE
HEY I cant mo I CANT FUCKIN’
MOVE

HOWE (0C)

“And why the sea is boiling hot

Suddenly a guy who could be HOWE leans into frame peering
at us He wears a surgical mask which rustles as he speaks

HOWE (CONTD)
“And whether pigs have wings”

WALLACE
Can you help me I can’t move

The Howe-ish surgeon snaps a blade onto a power BONE SAW

HOWE
A loaf of bread the Walrus said
Is what we chiefly need

He exits the frame as he punctuates his line with two quick
pulls on his power saw The sound is chilling

WALLACE
What’s that What the fuck’s
H-Hey man what’s that noi
HOWE (0C)
“Pepper and vinegar besides
Are very good indeed”

WALLACE
HELP SOMEBODY FUCKIN’ HELLLP

Howe quickly comes back into the shot with a rag that he
stuffs below frame presumably into our mouth We hear
Wallace fighting it

WALLACE (CONT’D)
NO DONT N-mmmmmmmm MMMMMMM

Howe sticks a very large needle into a bottle draws a big
dose of the solution extracts and taps the shot a few times

HOWE
“Now if youre ready Oyster
dear”

He administers the injection to us below frame

WALLACE
MMM MMMMM MMMMMMMM MMMM

And just as Howe exits the shot again he says

HOWE
“We can begin to feed”

The chilling sound of the bone saw snaps to life again

WALLACE

Suddenly we hear the power saw cutting into meat and bone
Blood splatters our POV shot The muffled screaming rises to
a Maniacal crescendo before we HARD CUT TO

INT ALLISON’S BEDROOM - NIGHT FLASHBACK

Wallace is getting blown in bed We can’t see it but we can
tell by his expression He grabs at an OC woman’s head

WALLACE (CONTD)
STOP STOP STOP

His arms relax He smiles satisfied Then his blissful
expression gives way to light disgust

WALLACE (CONT’D)
Ewwwwwww Don’t just drool it out

ALLISON joins Wallace from under the sheets smiling
mischievously as she wipes her mouth

WALLACE (CONTD)

ALLISON (0C)

WALLACE

That’s bullshit man I made a

(no response so)
Cut me some slack okay I’m
fighting for my life out there

INT BED ROOM - DAY
ECU on WALLACE’S EYES They snap open and look around
Wallace is in a large wheelchair tucked under blankets

There’s music playing on a small radio Wallace groggily
looks around

His eyes fall on Howe who sits in his wheelchair smoothing
what looks like a walrus tusk with a piece of sandpaper He
looks up to see Wallace awake

HOWE
Well look who’s back

Howe puts down his project and wheels over to Wallace

HOWE (CONTD)
You gave me quite a scare

Wallace looks at Howe unable to speak he’s so groggy

HOWE (CONT’D)
Heavens What kind of nurse am I

Howe pours a cup of water and puts a straw in it He holds
to Wallace’s mouth and let’s him sip Wallace struggles to
do sipping slowly Howe smiles with each swallow

HOWE (CONT’D)
There you go Wet your whistle my
dry little thistle

Wallace stops sipping from the straw and tries to come out
his haze looking around

WALLACE
Wha Wha

HOWE
What happened Oh dear boy - you
collapsed right in front of me One
minute I’m waxing lyrically about
my Many ocean voyages and the
next You’re falling out of your
chair unconscious I had no idea
what was going on until I saw a
rather intimidating spider crawl
from your pant leg

WALLACE
Ssspider

HOWE
A Brown Recluse A rather toxic
little insect These woods are
crawling with them

WALLACE
A spider bit me
(looking around)
Where’s my phone

it
do

of

HOWE
Yes That Well the Doctor
stepped on it and broke the phone
I am afraid It lies in pieces

WALLACE
There was a Doctor

HOWE
Doctor Mosier lives a mere eight
miles on He was here within a half
an hour of your episode

WALLACE
I cant feel my legs

HOWE
That would be the spinal injection
The Brown Recluse sank her fangs
into your leg and pumped you full
of so much poison that your poor
ankle was as big around as an
elephants leg

Wallace looks down at his legs for the first time noticing
something strange about the shape under the blankets

HOWE (CONT’D)
The only problem you see was the
spider venom It was traveling to
your heart So the Doctor was
forced to take necessarily
drastic measures to save your life

Wallace pulls his blanket aside to see one of his legs has
been amputated above the knee

WALLACE
Oh my God

HOWE
(back to his tusk project)
I know I’m so so sorry

WALLACE
WHAT THE FUCK

HOWE
(polishing the tusk)
Just let it out my boy

WALLACE
A FUCKING SPIDER DID THIS

HOWE
Nature can be so very red in tooth
and claw

WALLACE
WHAT

HOWE
Tennyson

WALLACE
What the fuck are you talking
about

(looking around)
Why am I still here Why didn’t we
go to the hospital

HOWE
Hospitals carry diseases This room
is completely sanitized so the
Doctor felt you’d be better off to
convalesce here

WALLACE
That makes no sense

HOWE
(thinks then)
Doesnt it

WALLACE
I wanna talk to the Doctor Where
is he

HOWE

Oh well he’s making his rounds

WALLACE
Rounds What rounds We’re in the
middle of nowhere

HOWE
(looking toward window)
No Mister Brighton - I’ve been to
the middle of nowhere And it is a
ghastly place

Wallace looks at Howe and the tusk he sands over and over
again saying nothing now Wallace tries to get out of his
chair but he can’t He pulls his covers off to reveal that
he’s belted in at the waist with no buckle in sight

WALLACE
What the fuck’s this

Howe turns his attention back to Wallace in a lazy “Hmmm-
kinda raised-eyebrow glance

HOWE
Oh That The belt is to keep you
from falling over until the spinal
wears off and you have full control
of all your faculties again
(off stump)
Almost all your faculties

WALLACE
I need a phone okay Please I
gotta call my family

HOWE
Doctor Mosier removed all the
phones so you would remain
undisturbed But I’1l ask him if
you can call home after supper

Howe wheels toward the door

HOWE (CONTD)

Until then you’re still heavily

tranquilized So get some rest
(stopping and turning)

I am truly sorry for your loss

Howe exits Alone in the room Wallace looks down at his
amputated leg and the tears come

EXT CHAPEL HILL - NIGHT

We see the moon rise over the Chapel Hill estate We can see
the dining room lit up inside

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Seated in his wheelchair at one end of a dining table is
Howe fully dressed A heavily sedated Wallace’s wheelchair
is pulled up to the other end of the table Howe delicately
cuts his meal Wallace doesn’t touch his

HOWE (CONTD)
Youre not eating

WALLACE
I can’t move my arms
HOWE
That would be the morphine It is
capitol for the leg pain and dare

I say the onl
from howling

ly thing keeping you
in agony However it

tends to leave one a bit sleepy

WALLACE
I’m not sleepy I’m immobilized
HOWE

The melanchol

ly that accompanies

losing a limb must be akin to that
of mourning a close friend you too
often took for granted

WALLACE

(beat)
There was no

spider Was there

Howe looks at Wallace confused though he’s still chewing

HOWE
Of course there was A Brown
Recluse Colloquially known as the

Hobo Spider

WALLACE
And you saw it

HOWE
Yes

WALLACE

(beat)

You saw the spider

HOWE
I only wish I had spied the beast
before he attacked

WALLACE
What’d it look like

HOWE

The arachnid

assailant Well A

typical spider a legion of legs

very small One might be tempted to

describe it as itsy bitsy

Wallace cocks his head at this Howe starts singing

HOWE (CONTD)

went up the water spout

WALLACE
Holy shit

HOWE
Down came the rain and washed the
spider out Up come

WALLACE
LEMME OUT OF THIS CHAIR YOU
FUCKING PSYCHO LEMME OUT HELP
SOMEBODY HELLLLLLPPPP

As Wallace screams Howe angrily pushes back from the table
gets out of his wheelchair marches briskly to Wallace and
slaps him across the face hard He then marches back to his
wheelchair sits and continues eating Wallace stares wide-
eyed He now realizes how fucked he is

HOWE

(cuts food vigorously)
Now Let us eliminate the chuffa -
shall we Mister Brighton Perhaps
it would be best at this stage in
our burgeoning relationship to
reveal our true hearts with
absolute candor

Howe stops cutting his meat and looks up at Wallace Here
comes the trailer moment as Howe says

HOWE (CONTD)

I have over the last few months
been constructing a realistic
walrus costume

Holy Fucking Shit A tear runs down Wallace’s cheek
Howe stabs a piece of steak and eyes it for a moment
HOWE (CONTD)

With minor modifications I

believe it will fit you perfectly

Howe sticks the steak in his mouth and chews Wallace
silently cries

WALLACE
Oh Jesus what the fuck man

HOWE
Now naturally whilst in the
walrus suit you must be a walrus
There must be no speaking in a
human voice Do you understand Any
communication must be done strictly
as a walrus

WALLACE
(crying bereft)
Please

HOWE
Be not vexed or heavy of heart We
two are embarking on an expedition
not unlike that of the doomed
Anastasia You see their mistake
was looking for monsters out there
They needn’t have left the dock
The beast has always lied within

Howe tapes his heart Wallace cries like a child

WALLACE
WHYYYYYYYYY

HOWE

“Why” To solve a riddle older than
the Sphinx To answer the question
that has plagued us since we first
crawled from the surf and stood
erect in the sun

(stands raises glass)
Is man indeed a walrus at heart

Wallace musters enough energy to bellow but whatever he was
injected with makes it come out more like an animal’s howl

Howe is delighted by this He starts howling back in return
We go out on a wide shot of captor and captive at either end
of the table howling - one in agony one in mockery The
sound is not unlike that of warring walruses

EXT CHAPEL HILL - NIGHT

The howling continues What does it matter They’re in the
middle of the woods

EXT WOODS - SAME

A deer in the wild reacts to the howling in the distance

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Wallace is sleeping sitting up in his wheelchair Suddnely
we hear the faint sound of an obnoxious smart phone ring tone
(Aw Aw Aw Ooo-ah Ooo-ah C’MON NOW MORE MARGHARITAS”)
Push in on Wallace and as we land in a close-up his eyes
snap open Somewhere the smart phone continues ringing

EXT QUAINT WINNIPEG HOME - DAY FLASHBACK

Wallace’s rental car is outside the swinger house We hear
the same faint sound of an obnoxious smart phone ring tone
(Aw Aw Aw Ooo-ah Ooo-ah C’MON NOW MORE MARGHARITAS”)

INT RENTAL CAR - SAME

CLOSE ON THE PHONE It’s a picture of Allison making a goofy
face The phone rings unanswered

Wallace stares at the phone for a beat then clicks ignore
and stuffs it in his pocket as he gets out of the car and
heads up the walkway of the swinger house

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

A door opens and Wallace wheels out into the hallway The
faint sound of the obnoxious smart phone ring tone (Aw Aw
Aw Ooo-ah Ooo-ah C’MON NOW MORE MARGHARITAS”) is louder
now Wallace wheels as quietly as he can searching for the
source Just as he gets closer and it gets louder it stops

INT STUDY - NIGHT

Wallace wheels into the room where he had sat with Howe
before the madness It’s dark but the moonlight through the
window reveals enough detail for him to maneuver From the
confines of his chair he looks for the phone

Wallace is a five feet from us In the severe foreground his
cell phone ignites in the darkness letting him know he has
just missed a call from Allison Wallace desperately turns
his chair and wheels over to us

Wallace punches recall and keeps looking over his shoulder to
see if Howe is anywhere nearby

INT ALLISON’S BATHROOM - SAME

Allison’s smart phone is plugged into a charger on the sink
It’s also on vibrate so there’s no ring alerting her to
Wallace’s incoming call There’s another phone charging
beside it on the basin face down

Reflected in the mirror we can see the bathroom door is half
open Allison sits on her bed in the next room wearing just
a t-shirt and underwear She’s talking to someone in her
bedroom that we can’t see

ALLISON
He calls me and he says he’s not
gonna fuck the swingers and he’s
coming home And now he doesn’t
answer my calls for three days

On the sink the smart phone stops vibrating and indicates a
missed call on the screen

INT STUDY - SAME

Wallace quietly barks a desperate plea for help into his
smart phone

WALLACE

Help me Allison I was abducted
and I shit you not I lost a leg
This guy’s talking about making me
an animal or something He’s
fucking nuts You gotta save me
baby I swear I’1ll never fuck
anybody but you ever again Please
Please Please Please Come find
me I’m two hours outside Winnipeg
in the woods of Manitoba Call the
cops Please save me I’m so
scared Allison I’m so scared I’m
never gonna see you again

(he silently cries)
I don’t wanna hang up Oh God
please be there Ally Please hear
this Please God Please Jesus
Please please please hear me

Wallace tries to muffle his whimpering as he hangs up the
phone He holds it to his forehead crying for a beat before
he tries to pull himself together He looks over his shoulder
and dials another number

INT ALLISON’S BATHROOM - SAME

The face-down phone charging beside Allison’s on the basin
rattles around vibrating with an incoming call

Reflected in the mirror we can see the half-open bathroom
door and Ally on her bed listening to someone we can’t see

MAN’S VOICE
I don’t wanna talk about him
anymore okay He’s not here I am
And I wanna fuck you like crazy
You - not some swingers in Canada

Allison smiles She pulls her shirt off and lays down

ALLISON
Go brush your teeth

In the mirror we see the half open bathroom door swing wide
revealing a naked TEDDY entering the bathroom He grabs a
toothbrush and notices his phone vibrating

Teddy looks at his phone to see WALLACE is calling

He presses ignore puts the phone down and looks at himself
in the mirror as he brushes his teeth

INT HALLWAY - SAME

Wallace rolls out of the study the smart phone between his
shoulder and ear

TEDDY MESSAGE
This is Teddy Gimme head-y

WALLACE
It’s me I’m being held captive in
Manitoba A crazy fucker called
Howard Howe cut off my leg

Wallace’s wheelchair clears the study doorway We rack focus
to the fireplace mantle where the walrus oosik used to be

INT BEDROOM - SAME
Mid S0S-call Wallace wheels back into his bedroom

WALLACE (CONT’D)
Seriously man this crazy fucker
says he’s gonna turn me into a

WHAM Wallace is struck on the head hard by the walrus oosik
his phone clattering to the floor Reveal Howe in his
nightgown and nightcap panting holding the oosik

HOWE
Your life as you knew it is over
Mister Brighton If you want to
continue living you will only do
so as a walrus The tusk will be
your only salvation

His head lolling struggling to stay conscious Wallace
bleeds from his skull crying and screaming at Howe

HOWE (CONT’D)
Youll be a walrus or you’ll no
longer be at all

And Howe brings the oosik down hard on Wallace again
knocking him out in his wheelchair

EXT LOS ANGELES APARTMENT COMPLEX - MORNING
We see joggers and people walking dogs
INT ALLISON’S BATHROOM - MORNING
Allison shuffles in and sits on the toilet sleepily peeing
At the sink she grabs a tooth brush pastes it and go to
work As she brushes she activates her smart phone It shows
the message from Wallace Allison stops brushing
ALLISON
(brush in mouth)

Asshole
She presses the voice mail button and puts the phone to her
ear resuming her teeth brushing She listens for a beat
then goes wide-eyed
INT ALLISON’S BEDROOM - SAME
Allison jumps on the bed phone in hand shaking Teddy awake

ALLISON (CONT’D)
Teddy wake up

TEDDY
Huh

ALLISON
(panic)
Get the fuck up and listen to this
message I think Wallace is in
trouble

She presses the speaker button and Wallace’s message plays
Teddys grogginess wears off as he listens Allison runs to
the bathroom and grabs Teddy’s phone

ALLISON (CONTD)
He called you too Oh my God Oh
my God oh my God oh my God

She hits the voice mail and speaker buttons on Teddy’s phone

TEDDY
(off Allison’s phone)
That can’t be real He’s just
fuckin’ with you Ally

We hear the message Wallace left for Teddy which is
interrupted by the sound of Wallace getting whacked across
the skull with the oosik Then the phone goes dead

Teddy and Allison look at one another deeply concerned
Teddy dials Wallace’s number on his phone and waits for an
answer that’s not coming

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Wallace’s smart phone vibrates on the floor Nobody’s there
to pick it up In the distance the sound of Pinky Tomlin’s
The Object of My Affection plays

HOWE (0C)
Uh-oh Someone’s looking for
Walllllll-acccce

INT OPERATING ROOM - SAME

Wallace’s phone ringing in the other room is drowned out by
an old Victrola which provides the scratchy 1926 ditty In
the background an out-of-focus Howe is hunched over a table

HOWE (CONT’D)
It must feel nice knowing there’s
someone out there who cares about
you

We’re close on Howe now He pulls a suture into the frame
then brings it below the frame sewing something we can’t
see During his monologue we’ll slowly circle him never
revealing what he’s sewing

HOWE (CONTD)
That’s how I felt on the island -
with dear sweet Tusk He was the
only living thing that ever had my
best interests at heart Even in my
childhood I was not cared for so
much as filed away - like a
document A document fed into
shredding machine that was fueled
by the blood of the innocent
(beat)
You see I am a Duplessis Orphan

INSERT NEWSREEL FOOTAGE

File footage of Maurice Duplessis Quebec Premier from 30s
40’s and 50’s

HOWE (VO)

Maurice Duplessis was the Premier
of Quebec in those days - the head
of the conservative party Union
Nationale He was an advocate for
rural Canadians - a union-busting
anti-Communist crusading for
provincial rights with strong ties
to the Catholic Church And it was
in secret collusion with these
charlatans of the Lord that
Duplessis brought upon Quebec La
Grande Noirceur

INT OPERATING ROOM - SAME
Howe stares ruefully at nothing lost in thought

HOWE
The Great Darkness

He shakes it off and goes back to sewing what we can’t see

HOWE (CONTD)

They say there are three subjects
one must always avoid at a dinner
party so as not to make people
feel uncomfortable religion
politics and sex And yet it was
these same sinister forces - this
infernal triumvirate - that
destroyed my childhood and made it
so very uncomfortable

EXT MONTREAL IN THE 40’s - DAY FLASHBACK

Holding the hands of his PARENTS a 10 year old HOWE looks up

HOWE (VO)

When I was just a boy my Mother
and Father took me to Montreal As
a child of the plains I had never
seen anything so big and beautiful
in my entire life

INT MONTREAL BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

High overhead on a mugging scene

Two thugs hold Howe’s parents at knife point while the boy
looks on terrified The Father hands over his wallet and is
knifed viciously The Mother’s throat is slashed and the
attackers flee leaving Howe with his dying parents

HOWE (VO)
But when night falls in Montreal
the horrors come out to play As we
walked to dinner we found
ourselves accosted by brigands in a
back alley My Father was stabbed
repeatedly by a mugger’s knife My
Mother’s throat was slashed as if
she were cattle

INT OPERATING ROOM - SAME
Howe stops sewing to reflect

HOWE
The police called it a miracle that
I was spared Yet in the years of
nights that followed I would wish
I too had been dispatched with my
beloved parents and spared an
eventual fate worse than death

EXT QUEBEC ORPHANAGE - DAY FLASHBACK
A TEN YEAR OLD HOWE sits on a bench outside an office

HOWE (VO)

At ten years old with no known
living relatives I was placed ina
Quebec home for abandoned boys

Inside the office we can see two priests and a nun argue
pointing to the young Howe on the other side of the door

HOWE (VO)

I was a true orphan robbed of both
my parents by the dirty blades of
French Canadian sociopaths

INT QUEBEC ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

Close on the dirty sad faces of 1940’s Canadian orphans all
staring at us blankly hollow

HOWE (VO)
However many of my fellow orphans
were not orphans at all - they were
only categorized as such following
forced separation from their unwed
mothers at the behest of the
powerful Catholic Church

INT HOSPITAL - DAY FLASHBACK

A young bed-ridden Mother screams pinned by orderlies A
nun exits the room holding a newborn

HOWE (VO)
The church of that era destroyed
generations of Canadian families
with her divine license to yank
bastard children from the arms of
their Mothers

INT ORPHANAGE - DAY FLASHBACK
Wide shot way too many orphans in a room

HOWE (VO)
But hungry babies are costly
babies And as the budgets of the
state-financed orphanages soared
so too did the imaginations of
Duplessis and the heads of the
Catholic Church in Quebec

INT OPERATING ROOM - SAME
Howe continues his tale slowly sewing

HOWE
You see the orphanages were the
financial responsibility of the
provinces - in this case the very
Catholic province of Quebec But
the mental institutions They
were paid for by the Canadian
government And so in an effort to
secure more money from Canada
Duplessis and the Church developed
a scheme to obtain federal funding
by reclassifying the orphanages
as mental health-care facilities
If that didn’t work they simply
closed the orphanage and shipped
children to insane asylums
Thousands of children died and were
reborn as lunatics on paper

INT INSANE ASYLUM - DAY FLASHBACK

Ten year old Howe is marched by a priest down a hallway
filled with cells from which the insane reach for him

HOWE (VO)

And this is what happened to me A
priest I never met falsified my
records and labelled me mentally
deficient - all so Quebec and the
church could gorge themselves on
the government teat

INT INSANE ASYLUM CELL CORRIDOR - NIGHT FLASHBACK

A bloody terrified ten year old Howe runs down the hallway
in tears pursued by two giggling mental patients

HOWE (VO)

And for the next five years I was
raped Beaten Tortured One night
I was even filleted for
experimentation - like a dead frog
All to feed the greed of monsters I
would never even meet

INT ASYLUM OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT FLASHBACK
Young Howe is out on a table
Doctors have opened his skull to examine his brain

HOWE (VO)
My humanity was peeled away like
the shell of a peanut as I endured
unnecessary surgeries at the hands
of the aberrant I was not a person
to them - I was something to be
used And use me they did But I
used them as well As they worked
I watched I adapted I learned

INT OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT
Howe takes a break from sewing to remember the horror

HOWE
One needn’t curse the Lord to know
of Hell - simply ask an orphan You
see an orphan has no advocate -
nobody to fight for them And with
no one to answer to for their
horrid crimes these devils ran
amuck with my innocence

Howe goes back to sewing

HOWE (CONTD)
I have had things in my mouth that
no human being should be forced to
taste I have had instruments
shoved inside of me that no human
being should ever have to endure
Priests politicians pederasts
nuns nurses and night watchmen -
all of them witches satisfying
their most base physical and
financial desires through the
lips and sphincter of a child

EXT SECURITY FENCE NEAR WOODS - NIGHT FLASHBACK

The young Howe we saw in the ship’s kitchen scales a barbed-
wire fence escaping into the night

HOWE (VO)
At age 15 I managed to escape - at
which time I fled from Canada I
joined the American military got
on a boat and never looked back

INT OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT
Howe uses his teeth to cut the suture from the needle

HOWE
Until now

Off-camera Howe ties the suture closed We come around to
reveal an unconscious Wallace a bite guard in his mouth

HOWE (CONTD)
Man is a savage animal Mister
Brighton

Pull back to reveal Howe has Wallace splayed out on an
operating table and the old man is stitching Wallaces
underarms to the sides of his body creating a crucified a
sort of T-Rex-Jesus looking affair We can also see his other
leg has been amputated now as well Behind this Canadian
Frankenstein and his monster-in-the-making we can see TWO
old-timey pull-down medial maps of the HUMAN body and the
WALRUS body hanging from the ceiling as well as a third
newer medial map between them detailing how the two can be
fused as one It gruesomely reveals Wallace’s fate

HOWE (CONT’D)
Better to be a walrus instead

As we pull back further we see Wallace’s amputated leg
resting on a table in a bucket of ice beside an intimidating
array of surgical instruments In the shadows we can make
out a realistic oversized walrus suit hanging from a rack

EXT LA CIENEGA BLVD - DAY
Allisons car speeds down La Cienega toward the airport

TEDDY
-his last name is Brighton B-R-I-
G-H-T-O-N

INT ALLISON’S CAR - SAME

Allison drives like a mad-woman Teddy is on the phone with
his laptop open

TEDDY (CONTD)
He said he was two hours outside of
Winnipeg We know he rented a car
but we don’t know where he rented
it from So as soon as we land
well go to every car rental desk
at the airport to see if anyone
remembers Wallace We find where he
rented his car we can track him
through the car’s recovery system
(listens then)
Recent pictures Yes on our web
site It’s called PillowPantscom

On the laptop screen we see a video clip of Wallace and
Teddy doing their podcast live at a comedy club A close-up
shows a happy smiling Wallace

EXT AIRPORT - DAY
An AIR CANADA plane takes off hurling itself into the sky
INT THE ENCLAVE

Close on an old speaker from which echoes the sounds of
seagulls and surf Over that we hear inhuman howls of
anguish not seeing their source

Projected onto dirty old sheets hung from the wall is a
looping reel of seagulls on a beach the surf rolling behind
them in the background It’s as if the projected reel is
intended to be a habitat background

HOWE (0C)
The sun was shining on the sea
Shining with all his might

The howls turn into sobbing now The recording of the sounds
of the surf still blares We dolly down a small drawbridge
to reveal what looks like carved earth man-made to look like
a small rock island

HOWE (0C) (CONT’D)
He did his very best to make the
billows smooth and bright

The drawbridge acts as a walkway over a moat that surrounds
the rock island We get the idea it goes deep The water is
dark A festive beach ball floats along the surface until
it’s disturbed by ripples

HOWE (0C) (CONT’D)
And this was odd because it was
the middle of the night

FROM UNDER WATER we see one of Howe’s leg dangling in the
pool from the fake rock platform above He wades it back and
forth creating the rippling waves that move the ball We
hear a sudden dulled screaming howl from under water

Close on a WALRUS TAIL on the platform as the howl turns into
sobbing We hold the walrus tail sharp in the foreground to
see it’s creepy texture but soft in the background Howe’s
bare right leg very near what looks like the large body
connected to the tail The tail is chained to the platform

HOWE (CONTD)
(soothingly)
There there Mister Tusk

Close on a walrus flipper - or the mockery of one - built
from the pelt of a dead walrus with fresh broadly grotesque
stitching marks in evidence The flipper has a small metal
hole with a chain attached to it The chain is mounted to the
platform Howe’s arm wraps around it hugging

HOWE (CONTD)
(as if talking to a dog)

I know Mister Tusk I know
(singing now)

Sometimes it’s so very hard to be

the elephant of the deep blue sea

Close on the large tusk we saw Howe polishing earlier in the
film after Wallace lost his first leg It has a twin now We
see the tips of both but not the mouth from which they jut
The sickly sucking breathing is loudest here

HOWE (CONTD)
(still singing)

With mustache made for finding food

and a heart of gold thats made of

gooo0000000d

Close on Howe - on his back on the platform laying under the
blubber of what looks like a walrus belly He’s naked but the
blubber covers his pelvis One of his legs dangles in the
water below the other rests on the platform Mesmerized
Howe hugs a flipper with one arm and with his other hand he
caresses the tip of a tusk that pokes in and out of the
frame The blubber blanket moves ever so slightly atop him

in sync with the throaty sobbing and whimpering

Finally Howe rolls his eyes frustrated - his buzz harshed

HOWE (CONT’D)
The blubber of a walrus is the most
comfort I’ve ever known outside the
womb But the blubbering of a
walrus Excruciating

We hear more sobbing Then he bellows ferociously

HOWE (CONTD)
STOP CRYING WALRUSES NEVER CRY

The sobbing turns to whimpering Howe closes his eyes as if
trying to get back to that magical place

HOWE (CONT’D)
(back to singing)

The walrus swims with mermaids deep

and eats and plays and loves and

sleeeeeeeps

We boom up from Howe and up the long tusks implanted in the
butchered mouth of the WALLACE-RUS

REVEAL WALLACE-RUS It’s a freakish Frankensteinian affair
a giant walrus pelt sewn onto the body of the altered
Wallace The surgically implanted tusks puff out his cheeks
in a walrus-like fashion The front ball of his nose has been
removed to give a more snouty appearance His ears have been
trimmed to nubbish little ear-holes His head is shaved bald
the top of the walrus pelt sewn to his scalp the bottom sewn
to his chin A big fake mustache creepily and comically
completes the effect Wallace-Rus whimpers in utter despair

HOWE (CONTD)
(singing still)
Walrus is friend to all the world
beloved by both boys and

Howe goes from singing to cackling He’s blissful

HOWE (CONT’D)
Oh how I’ve missed you Mister
Tusk How I’ve missed our merry
times together on Ponder Rock

EXT CAR RENTAL JOINT - NIGHT

INT BAR BATHROOM - NIGHT

handbill The space where the handbill was is now covered
over by newer newspaper clippings and GARAGE SALE notices

A French Canadian in boxers and a tank top looks at us He
steps out of the room and closes the door slightly saying

calmly in an extremely French Canadian accent

Howe comes around to face the Wallace-Rus

HOWE (CONT’D)
You must learn to sw

The Wallace-Rus attempts to lunge at Howe with his tusks
howling with an inhuman guttural attack cry But
unaccustomed to his new body the Wallace-rus cannot make it
far Howe side-steps the lunge chuckling mischievously

HOWE (CONTD)
Oooo He is answering the call of
the wild is he He is letting go
of his so-called humanity and
unleashing the feral walrus inside

Howe moves to the back of the platform behind the whimpering
Wallace-Rus

HOWE (CONT’D)
Well now - if you want to be a
walrus I do say a walrus swims

Howe viciously kicks the Wallace-Rus who then goes tumbling
into the pool howling Howe claps excitedly

HOWE (CONTD)
SWIM MISTER TUSK SHOW ME HOW THE
FISHIES SWIM

The Wallace-Rus has no arms to speak of - they’re sewn to his
side and stuffed into the walrus-suit flippers The weight of
the outfit threatens to pull the terrified Wallace-Rus under
the water It’s like watching Jabba the Hutt drown

Howe barks from the platform

HOWE (CONTD)
YOU ARE A MIGHTY CREATURE OF THE
SEA SO SWIM SWIM DAMN YOU

Unable to keep the weight of the walrus suit above water the
Wallace-Rus goes under for good

UNDER THE WATER the Wallace-Rus is not swimming he’s
sinking in his walrus suit struggling to get air eyes
widened in terror He sinks to the bottom of the pool where
he lands face to face with

ANOTHER WALRUS-MAN Long dead his mouth frozen in a silent
scream This was once a human being like Wallace Now he’s a
blubber-encrusted mockery of a man One of his tusks is
busted and there’s another tusk in what used to be his chest

Seeing his own eventual fate the Wallace-Rus bellows
bubbles bursting from his mouth under the water

From under the surface we see Howe looking down at us

INT THE ENCLAVE - NIGHT LIGHTING
The Wallace-Rus is raised from the pool soaked and sobbing

Howe holds the button that lifts a porous metal platform
containing the Wallace-Rus from the water The engine pulley
system that raises the platform operates the same way shark
cages are raised and lowered into the ocean from boats

HOWE
Why do you still cry as if fouled
You can’t possibly be mourning your
lost humanity can you
(as the lift stops)
Why

Howe moves around to the front of the Wallace-Rus and leans
on his knees talking to him like an animal

HOWE (CONT’D)
Why on earth would you want to be
human In all my travels I’ve only
ever found mankind to be an
ocean of shit And my vessel she
lists leaking

Howe sits beside the Wallace-rus petting him as it sobs

HOWE (CONT’D)
I am so very tired Mister Tusk -
battered by a life of cruel fate
poor decisions and the terrible
consequences of both

Howe gazes into the pool the weight of the world on him He
closes his eyes and breaks into a very sad world-weary a
cappella rendition of The Water is Wide

HOWE (CONTD)
The water is wide
I cant cross oer
Neither have I
the wings to fly

The Wallace-Rus cannot believe where the fuck he is in life
right now He’s beyond fear and sadness he’s letting go of
his humanity howling Howe continues his soulful song
petting the Wallace-Rus

large bucket which he hides behind his back

HOWE (CONT’D)
You must be so hungry by now

Howe reveals a large iced mackerel which he swings and
throws on the platform It slides a foot toward the Wallace-
Rus who snaps to attention as best he can Howe smiles

HOWE (CONTD)
Bon appetit Monsieur Tusk

Howe crosses the drawbridge and seemingly exits the enclave
We hear a door The lights go dim Then all we hear is the
hum of the pool filter and the breathing of the Wallace-Rus
Close on the Wallace-Rus in the barely-lit room He snorts at
the fish six or seven feet from him on the platform - too
far for him to reach He tries to move but merely rolls
Frustrated he lets out an agonized howl

In a metal door we see a slit quietly open at eye-level We
push in on it to see Howe’s eyes watching the Wallace-Rus

we have the element of surprise

TEDDY
(to Allison sternly)
We should call the cops or the
Mounties or whatever the fuck But
we need pros Ally
(to Lapointe)
No offense

GUY LAPOINTE
Go fuck yourself No offense

Allison is torn She looks to Lapointe

ALLISON
You really think we can find him
Mister Lapointe

GUY LAPOINTE
Monsieur Lapointe And yes if we
go now I believe in my ‘eart we
can save the man you love from an
unimaginable fate

INT THE ENCLAVE

Howe is in the pool with the semi-conscious Wallace-Rus
Object of My Affection plays again with surf and seagulls

The Walace-Rus floats on his back blood running off him into
the water as Howe tows the man-beast around the pool like the
Wallace-Rus is his baby

HOWE
Well isn’t this soothing to the
soul If I close my eyes I’m
almost back at our beloved Ponder
Rock - where I knew the most peace
in this twisted hateful world

Howe closes his eyes and inhales deeply

HOWE (CONTD)
Oh how I miss our tiny paradise
Mister Tusk This poor facsimile is
the best I could do to recreate
that magical enclave where we first
became such good friends

(beat sadly)
Until that terrible day

EXT ISLAND - NIGHT FLASHBACK

Close on the young shipwrecked Howe (the cook on the
Anastasia plus wild hair and beard and dark tanned skin)

HOWE (CONT’D)
You were not ready for the savagery
of man

He stares out at the night sea empty and desperate A small
fire lights his face in flickers

HOWE (VO)
The insatiable call for blood that
makes us the most unpredictable
animal that ever lived

Howe raises a hunk of meat to his mouth and eats blood
caking his lips Behind we can make out the lifeless walrus

HOWE (VO)
You had cared for me better than my
biological parents or the province
of Quebec but you were a stranger
to the abattoir of the human heart

Extreme close up on Howe’s mouth tearing into the flesh

HOWE (VO)
Man feeds on the meat and sinew of
the helpless Until we are all
alone

Howe tears at the walrus meat savagely when a light hits his
face Howe looks up suddenly staring wide-eyed

HOWE’S POV A SHIP IS ON THE HORIZON

Someone on the deck is flashing a searchlight at us This is
immediately followed by a long toot of the boat’s horn

HOWE (VO)
We survive at all costs only to
butcher and fuck again and again

Howe waves frantically Then he looks at the meat in his
hands and immediately breaks down crying

HOWE (VO)
Until we ourselves are at last
butchered or fucked in turn

INT THE ENCLAVE

Close on the Wallace-Rus almost a docile animal now in
Howe’s arms floating in the pool

HOWE
You were not prepared for me last
time Mister Tusk

Howe looks down at the Wallace-Rus compassionately

HOWE (CONTD)
You stood no chance in the fight
This time it will be different It
is why I have hardened you - to
show you how both kind and how
cruel man can be - before that
moment I betrayed you with a Judas-
Kiss-bludgeoning as you slept

Howe suddenly pushes the Wallace-Rus’ head under the water
holding it there Wallace-Rus tries to struggle but can’t

HOWE (CONTD)
And if I have truly brought out the
walrus in your soul this time

Howe pulls the Wallace-Rus up for air It gasps and sputters

HOWE (CONTD)
You might just prevail

Howe suddenly hugs the shit out of the Wallace-Rus like a
child with a puppy He weeps into the wet folds of his skin

AUDIO NOTE We hear an adaptation of the Fleetwood Mac TUSK
drum beat kick in It will underscore the rest of the film

EXT MANITOBA WOODS - DAY
Aerial footage of trees trees and lots more trees
INT HELICOPTER - SAME

Guy Lapointe rides up front with the pilot Allison and Teddy
are in the back Lapointe uses binoculars searching the
ground below Ally and Teddy do so the same without tech aid

BINOCULARS POV THE WOODS BELOW

Were searching through the treeline moving slowly ‘til we
stop then move on again As we scan we catch a glimpse of
something RED in the very green and brown treeline The POV
rushes back to the red blur and tries to focus We shakily
hold on a color that should not be in the wilderness buried
by branches so we can’t quite make it out

Guy Lapointe signals the helicopter pilot to take them down
EXT MANITOBA WOODS - SAME

The helicopter starts circling for a descent

EXT WOODS - DAY

A BIG GULP CUP sits on the forest floor Three sets of feet
surround it Tilt up to reveal Lapointe Allison and Teddy
Lapointe is carrying a long GUN CASE He looks off-camera and
exits the shot

Guy Lapointe studies the ground getting lower and lower
until he comes across A TIRE TREAD MARK in the earth where
none should be He looks up to the off-camera Ally and Teddy

EXT SMALL LAKE IN THE WOODS - DAY

The tip of Wallace’s rental car’s back bumper pokes out of
thicket of waterlogged leaves in the marshy body of water
Lapointe Ally and Teddy are on the opposite shore seeing
the car bumper Guy Lapointe puts his gun case on the ground
kneels and opens the lid

GUY LAPOINTE
The path is almost invisible to the
naked eye but it is there

Close on a silver-plated SHOTGUN and two silver-plated
HANDGUNS There are two cartons of shells as well

GUY LAPOINTE (CONT’D)
We follow it to where it ends we
will find your friend

Guy Lapointe pulls a handgun from the case

GUY LAPOINTE (CONT’D)
And the dangerous man who take ‘im
(holds up handgun)
This will make any dangerous man
considerably less dangerous

Guy Lapointe tries to hand Teddy the handgun

TEDDY
Whoa whoa whoa I’m not a gun guy

GUY LAPOINTE
But you are American no

TEDDY
Just because we can have guns
doesn’t mean I ever had one myself

Allison puts her hand on the gun Lapointe offers it freely
Allison takes it Teddy looks at her flummoxed for a minute
Then Guy Lapointe offers him the other gun

INT THE ENCLAVE

It’s dark We’re close on the sleeping Wallace-Rus Suddenly
we hear a speaker come to life The Wallace-Rus wakes in a
panic looking for the location of the voice in the dark

HOWE (0OC)
Sixty years ago today I was rescued
from the island of Ponder Rock a
mere hour after I had butchered my
sweet savior walrus to stay alive

WALLACE-RUS POV SOMETHING ELSE IS IN THE DARK

Wallace-Rus can see he’s not alone a large shape is a few
yards in the distance

EXT THE MANITOBA WOODS - DAY

We’re tracking across the floor of the woods seeing evidence
of tire tracks

HOWE (VO)
And for the last fifteen years I
have marked this solemn occasion by
giving my flippered friend the
fighting chance he never had

Guy Lapointe Ally and Teddy guns in hand creep through the
forest following the trail left by Wallace’s rental car

INT THE ENCLAVE
Close on Howe’s mouth in the dark covered by something

HOWE
You have been my greatest Tusk to
date And now we will finally find
out the answer to the riddle

The LIGHTS snap on forcing the Wallace-Rus to hide his face
with his flipper Reveal Wallace-Rus is in the empty moat
now drained of water The Wallace-Rus goes wide-eyed at

HOWE IN HIS OWN WALRUS SKIN MADE OF HUMAN FLESH We know
this because we can make out faces in the ripples of the man-
made blubber It’s flesh made of those he’d stolen and made
into human walruses for this same purpose over the years

Howe’s face pokes out from where the mouth of the walrus
would be so he glares from behind his tusks which act as a
sort of battle-helmet face-guard As weird as Wallace-Rus has
been to look at all this time Howe in his own walrus get-up
might even be a little scarier He bellows

HOWE (CONT’D)
Is man indeed a walrus at heart

The Wallace-Rus reacts as surprised as us as the walrus-
wearing Howe rushes at him flopping forward on a padded
belly as only a walrus can

BOOM Howe-Rus chest-slams into the Wallace-Rus as walruses
do in the wild atop ice flows before they tusk wrestle for
dominance The Wallace-Rus howls at us defensively

HOWE (CONTD)
FIGHT ME TUSK FIGHT ME OR DIE

Howe-Rus charges Wallace-Rus and gorges him with his tusks
puncturing the blubber prosthesis Stabbed in his shoulder
beneath the walrus skin Wallace-Rus howls in agony

EXT THE WOODS - DAY

Guy Lapointe Ally and Teddy march their trail guns drawn
Suddenly we hear the distant howls of Wallace-Rus echo in

the forest They freeze After a beat we hear it again

ALLISON
Wallace

Ally charges ahead gun held high Teddy and Lapointe react

INT THE ENCLAVE

BOOM Howe-Rus body slams into Wallace-Rus again goring him
with his tusks again The Wallace-Rus howls and struggles to
move away from the attack crying

HOWE
Just as I killed you to stay alive
on Ponder Rock you have a terrible
choice to make here Mister Tusk

The Howe-Rus shuffles menacingly

HOWE (CONTD)
You have to kill me if you want to
live And if you live It will only
be as the walrus you almost are

The bleeding terrified Wallace-Rus is wide-eyed as his
bizarre attacker shuffles toward him another foot

Close on Howe now

HOWE (CONT’D)
You either go full-walrus or you
go to Hell

Howe-Rus charges Wallace-Rus
Close on the eyes of the Wallace-Rus survival instincts
kicking in

The Wallace-Rus rears back just as the Howe-Rus reaches it
and he slams his tusks into the Howe-Rus puncturing the
costume and drawing blood from a howling Howe

EXT CHAPEL HILL - DAY

A POV RUNNING SHOT reveals the house in the distance buried
by the trees We hear the howling of Howe echo in the woods

Allison leads the charge determined to save her man

ALLISON
WALLAAAACCCCE

INT THE ENCLAVE

The Howe-Rus and the Wallace-Rus belly-buck viciously
slashing at each other with their tusks We hear the distant
call of Allison yelling Wallace’s name Wallace had the
upper-tusk on Howe for a moment but is distracted by Ally’s
cries He reacts wide-eyed with hope for a moment about to
bellow a response when Howe slashes his face with his tusks

EXT CHAPEL HILL - DAY

Allison leads Lapointe and Teddy in a race to the front door
When she gets up the front porch steps and to the door she
pounds it calling out Wallace’s name as she tries the knob

ALLISON (CONTD)
WALLACE WALLACE

INT THE ENCLAVE

The Howe-Rus and the Wallace-Rus fight barking at one
another like beasts blood and meat flying with every
incision their tusks make Wallace-Rus’ tusks come close to
Howe-Rus’ face and Howe slips his hand out of his costume to
punch Wallace-Rus in the face

HOWE
What a feral kitten youve become

INT CHAPEL HILL FOYER - DAY

The door knob is obliterated by repeated shots from the other
side of the door The gunshots stop and the door is kicked
open Allison leads the charge followed by the boys

ALLISON
WALLACE WHERE ARE YOU

We can see the oosik is gone from the fireplace mantle
INT THE ENCLAVE

We hear the pounding of feet on the ceiling above us and hear
the muffled cries of Allison and Teddy Wallace-Rus looks
from the ceiling to the Howe-Rus

HOWE
You have lasted longer than any of
the others because you have gone
full walrus You are so savagely
beautiful in your ferocity You
will kill me to stay alive The
amygdala has taken over Your
survival instinct has kicked in

Howe rips out of his costume pulling himself out of the
blubbery coat withdrawing the walrus oosik from the blubber

Wallace-Rus goes wide-eyed as Howe climbs to his feet using
the oosik as his crutch He raises the oosik above his head

HOWE (CONTD)
But so has mine

Howe brings the oosik down hard on the Wallace-Rus’ head and
Wallace-Rus bellows in excruciating pain in the empty pit

INT THE BASEMENT

Allison Lapointe and Teddy charge down a staircase
searching for the source of the howling

ALLISON
Oh my God WALLACE WALLACE WHERE
ARE YOU

We hear the muffled cries of the Wallace-Rus again

GUY LAPOINTE
‘e is behind this wall Find the
door Find the door

All three pour over the walls looking for an entry
INT THE ENCLAVE

The Wallace-Rus whimpers bloody and battered looking back
at the muffled sound of voices and pounding behind him The
oosik strikes him anew

Howe raises the oosik to strike again but the Wallace-Rus
lets out of roar and attacks Howe his tusks burying deep in
the old man’s chest essentially impaling him from above

Howe screams and spits blood releasing the oosik The
Wallace-Rus shakes Howe from side to side like a dog with a
toy When Howe slips off the Wallace-Rus’ tusks he lands
with a thud sputtering blood He looks up at the Wallace-
Rus and smiling manages to spit out

HOWE
You did it Mister Tusk You are
the walrus
(he giggles adding)
Coo-coo ca-choo

The Wallace-Rus dives atop Howe and gores him anew howling
as he repeatedly stabs the old man to death with his tusks

INT THE BASEMENT
Allison is tracing a groove in the wall with her finger

ALLISON
IVE GOT HINGES

Guy Lapointe levels his shotgun at the groove in the wall and
fires blasting tiny holes in the hidden door

INT THE ENCLAVE
Another shotgun blast shreds the door in the back wall

Allison Teddy and Lapointe rush into the enclave and stop
cold going wide-eyed at what they see

In the empty moat below them the Wallace-Rus is atop the
very bloody very punctured very dead Howe repeatedly
goring him with his tusks barking

Close on the horrified faces of Ally Teddy and Lapointe
left utterly speechless by what they’re seeing Until

ALLISON (CONTD)
WALLACE

The Wallace-Rus yanks its tusks from deep inside the
disemboweled Howe and snaps to attention panting heavily
taking in the sight of the rescue party The rescue party
stares right back equally as shocked

Close on Allison tears welling up in her eyes

ALLISON (CONTD)
Wallace Is that you

Close on the Wallace-Rus all humanity now gone Full walrus
The creature bellows ferociously at Allison and her
companions brandishing bloody tusks

Allison weeps Teddy puts an arm on her shoulder and she
turns into his chest the sound of the howling Wallace-Rus
filling the enclave

Lapointe looks down at the remains of Howe - his life-long
quarry He squints at the monster bellowing at them no
longer a man

Guy Lapointe looks to Teddy Teddy looks away unable to
watch Guy slowly aims his shotgun at the Wallace-Rus below

Close on the ferocious Wallace-Rus bellowing up Guy
Lapointe There is no humanity left in the eyes of the beast

EXT PARKING LOT - DAY

We see a car pull into an empty parking lot Allison and
Teddy emerge and open their trunk Burn in SIX MONTHS LATER

EXT PARK ENTRYWAY - SAME
Close on a wrapped package in Teddy’s arm

Teddy’s free hand is on Ally’s back for support The pair
pass a sign that reveals we’re at the ASSINIBOINE PARK ZOO

EXT ASSINIBOINE PARK ZOO - SAME

Teddy and Ally walks by the kangaroo habitat The kangas
regard them and go back to their business

They pass by Hudson the Polar Bear who dives into his pool
EXT ASSINIBOINE PARK ZOO BACK STAGE - SAME

Teddy and Ally wave to some zoo employees as they cross over
from where the general public is allowed to roam to where
only the zoo-keepers dwell They head for a small structure

INT THE ROOM - SAME

A door opens Teddy and Allison enter a dark room We get the
distinct impression they’re on a catwalk kind of affair lit
from below the light shimmering as if reflected on water

The pair look down at something we can’t see because we’re
looking up at them And both look sad Allison looks to
Teddy Teddy nods He starts opening the package

Close on the package Teddy unwraps Reveal a LARGE MACKEREL

Allison grabs the fish and carefully throws it into the
darkness watching We hear it hit a platform below followed
by the sound of a walrus snort Tears fill Allison’s eyes as
she quietly says

ALLISON (CONTD)
I love you Wallace

Crying Allison exits leaving Teddy standing there alone He
looks down into the darkness saddened Then he heads for
the door We hear the sign-off of the Pillow Pants podcast

WALLACE (VO)
and this is Wallace Brighton
saying it’s a big bad world out
there so put on your Pillow Pants

Crane down to reveal a new enclave While it’s a better
version of what we know it’s still not inspiring any
feelings of comfort We stop on the mackerel

Suddenly out of nowhere tusks gore the mackerel as the
Wallace-Rus savagely feeds We push in until we’re almost on
top of the beast It raises its head slightly to look at us
Then it unleashes a furious bellow as we
