Always look on the light side of Lite (WHISTLE)
If life seems jolly rotten

Theres sonething y youve forgotten

And -thats to laugh and smile and dance and sing

And 2lweys look on the bright side of Life (WHISTLB)

For life is quite absurd

And deaths the final word

You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin - give the audience a grin
Enjoy it - its your last chance anyhow

So always look on the bright side of death
Just’ before you draw your terminal breath
Lifes a piece of shit

When you look at it
Lifes a laugh and deaths a joke its true
Youll see its all a shew

Keep em laughingas you go
’ Just remember that the last laugh is on you

‘And always look on the bright side of life(WHISTLE)
Always look on the right side of life (WHISTLE)

WHISTLE AND VAMP TILL END FADE
