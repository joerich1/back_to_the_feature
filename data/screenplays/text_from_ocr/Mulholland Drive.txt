MULHOLLAND DRIVE

EXT NIGHT - HOLLYWOOD HILLS LOS ANGELES

Darkness Distant sounds of freeway traffic Then the closer
sound of a car - its headlights illumine an oleander bush and
the limbs of an Eucalyptus tree Then the headlights turn - a
street sign is suddenly brightly lit The words on the sign
read Mulholland Drive The car moves under the sign as
it turns and the words fall once again into darkness

EXT NIGHT - MULHOLLAND DRIVE

Gliding we follow the car - an older black Cadillac limousine
- as it winds its way up Mulholland Drive through the
darkness of the Hollywood Hills There is no one else on the
road As we drift closer to the car

CUT TO
INT BLACK CADILLAC LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

Two men in dark suits are sitting in the front seat A
beautiful younger dark-haired woman sits in back She sits
close up against the door and stares out into the darkness
She seems to be thinking about something Suddenly she turns
and looks ahead The car is slowing and moving off to the
side of the road
DARK-HAIRED WOMAN
What are you doing You dont stop
here

The car stops - half on half off the road at a dark blind
curve Both men turn to the woman

DRIVER
Get out of the car

CUT TO
EXT FURTHER UP MULHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT

Two cars - a convertible and a late model sedan are drag
racing toward the blind curve blocking the view of the
Cadillac limousine The cars are filled with crazed
teenagers Two girls are standing up through the sunroof of
the sedan screaming as their hair is whipped straight back

The cars are travelling so fast that they seem to almost
float as they fly with psychotic speed down both lanes of
Mulholland Drive

CUT TO
INT EXT - CADILLAC LIMOUSINE

The driver still in his seat has a pistol with a silencer
attached pointing at the woman The other man is getting out
of the car The woman is clutching the seat and the door
handle as if trying to anchor herself She is visibly afraid
The man who got out of the car tries the womans door but it
is locked He smiles as he reaches in through the front door
and unlocks her door He opens her door As he reaches for
her the womans face becomes flooded with light Her eyes
dart to the front windshield The driver flooded with light
turns just as the late model sedan slams into the Cadillac
limousine There is an explosion of metal and glass amidst
thunderous tearing sounds as the two cars become one in
death The convertible screams past with hardly a notice

The driver of the limousine dies instantly as his body is
jettisoned through the windshield The other man is torn as
the cars screech over him The woman is brutally thrown into
the back of the front seats as a cloud of dust and flying
rocks engulfs her The disastrous moving sculpture of the two
cars wants to climb up the hill then stops and slides back
toward the road The Cadillac tips onto its side Then all is
silent A fire erupts in the sedan and as the dust clears we
see the woman appear then crawl out of the Cadillac to the
road Her face is vacant There is a bleeding cut just above
her forehead She stands for a moment clutching her purse -
lost then begins to walk as if in a trance across
Mulholland down through the bushes and into darkness

DISSOLVE TO
EXT HOLLYWOOD HILLS - LATER - NIGHT

The woman slides down a hill through tangles of hostile
desert plants Sirens can be heard in the distance She
crosses through some trees and is suddenly confronted by a
coyote which snarls and leaps at her She screams and strikes
out with her purse in self defense The coyote backs away -
snarling The woman then loses control and runs at the coyote
and it races off She falls to the ground We can hear the
thunder of her heartbeat as the sirens grow louder She gets
up and stumbles through the trees When she clears them she
is standing overlooking all of Los Angeles glowing down
below She clumsily starts down toward it

DISSOLVE TO
HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT

The woman slides down a dusty hill and finds herself at
Franklin Avenue A car races by and its headlights flare on
her face Her expression shows fear and panic She doesnt
know where she is or where to go She runs frantically across
the street She moves quickly to a sidewalk which takes her
into a residential area

DISSOLVE TO
EXT HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT

The woman crosses Sunset Boulevard Coming up Sunset in the
distance is a police car with its sirens and lights going
She hurries into the darkness of another residential area A
car turns onto the street and comes toward her She
instinctively moves behind a tree until it passes

DISSOLVE TO
EXT HOLLYWOOD STREETS - LATER - NIGHT

As if being hunted in a foreign land the woman moves
desperately down another residential street A drunken couple
round the corner up ahead and start up the sidewalk toward
her She runs off the sidewalk and into the bushes in front
of an apartment building The couple passes by without
noticing her Feeling safe in these bushes her exhaustion
overtakes her and she lays her head down to sleep

DISSOLVE TO
EXT MULHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT

Police paramedics surround the wreckage Two detectives
HARRY MCKNIGHT and NEAL DOMGAARD (both mid 40s to 50) stare
at the remains of the two cars glowing white hot under the
crime scene lights A coroners van pulls out just after an
ambulance The ambulances siren begins to wail as it speeds
off The coroners van cruises slowly Detective Harry
McKnight and Detective Neal Domgaard continue staring They
do not look at each other They are each motionless for a
long moment

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT

DETECTIVE HARRY MCKNIGHT

Detective Harry McKnight turns and crosses Mulholland His
eyes move over each blade of grass at the shoulder - each
desert bush just beyond He slowly raises his gaze to the
shining lights of Hollywood laying far below like a galaxy
He looks out and wonders

CUT TO
EXT HOLLYWOOD STREETS - EARLY DAWN

The clang of a metal gate wakes the woman It is just getting
light and she sees an older red-headed woman carrying a
suitcase to the curb where a cab stands waiting with its
trunk open The cab driver appears with two suitcases which
he sets down next to the car The red-headed woman and the
cab driver both go back through the iron gate The woman in
the bushes pulls herself to the gate where she can peer into
the courtyard of this apartment building She sees the red-
headed woman and the cab driver go into an apartment and come
back out with more luggage

They leave the apartment door open When the red-headed woman
and the cab driver reach the cab they both begin loading the
bags into the trunk and backseat Their backs are to the
woman in the bushes who takes this opportunity to go quickly
into the courtyard and through the open apartment door

CUT TO
INT APARTMENT - EARLY DAWN

The woman comes into a living room where a single trunk
remains She goes further into the apartment and crouches
down in a back corner of the kitchen She listens as
footsteps come across the courtyard She hears the red-headed
woman and the cab driver get the trunk She hears them set it
down once they have it in the courtyard She hears the steps
of the red-headed woman come back inside the apartment She
hears the footsteps go all around the apartment and then she
hears the footsteps come toward the kitchen Remaining
frozen the dark-haired womans eyes look up as the red-
headed woman walks right past her grabs a set of keys off
the kitchen counter then leaves the apartment The woman can
hear the door being locked She lets go slides to the
kitchen floor and passes out

INT DENNYS RESTAURANT HOLLYWOOD - MORNING

Two well-dressed men HERB and DAN (mid 30s) are sitting at a
table drinking coffee Herb has finished eating his
breakfast but Dan hasnt touched his bacon and eggs - he
appears too nervous to eat A blonde waitress with a
nameplate saying DIANE lays the check on their table
smiles then walks off

HERB
Why did you want to go to breakfast if

DAN
I just wanted to come here

HERB
To Dennys I wasnt going to say
anything but why Dennys

DAN

HERB
Okay Why this Dennys

DAN

HERB
Go ahead

DAN
I had a dream about this place

HERB
Oh boy

DAN

HERB
Okay so you had a dream about this
place Tell me

DAN
Well its the second one Ive had but
they were both the same they start

night Its kinda half night but it
looks just like this except for the
light but Im scared like I cant tell
ya Of all people youre standing right
over there by that counter Youre in
both dreams and youre scared I get
even more frightened when I see how
afraid you are and then I realize what it
is - theres a manin back of this
place Hes the one hes the one
thats doing it I can see him through
the wall I can see his face and I hope
I never see that face ever outside a
dream

Herb stares at Dan to see if he will continue Dan looks
around nervously then stares at his uneaten food

DAN (contd)

Thats it

HERB
So you came to see if hes out there

DAN
To get rid of this god-awful feeling

HERB
Right then

Herb gets up picks up the bill and goes to the cashier to
pay Dan just sits

As Herb is paying the bill he looks over at Dan just as Dan
is turning to look at him From Dans point of view Herb is
standing in exactly the same spot as he stood in the dream
Herb gets a strange feeling turns back and finishes up with
the cashier He motions for Dan to follow him Dan rises
reluctantly and he and Herb make their way outside

CUT TO
EXT DENNYS
Now Herb waits for Dan to lead the way

DAN
Around here

Dan takes Herb across the front of Dennys to a narrow
sidewalk that leads down the side toward the back
They begin walking down the narrow sidewalk - past a
payphone Dan begins to sweat the nearer he gets to the rear
corner of the building Red bricks glide by slowly

CLOSER ON DAN
Beads of sweat cover his face He finds it difficult to
breathe Herb is just behind him unable to see the fear

overtaking his friend but Herb can feel something himself

The red bricks moving by now are coming to an end - the

corner is coming closer - the corner is now very close
Suddenly a man - a face a face dark and bum-like- moves
quickly out from behind the corner and stops - freezes -

staring into Dans eyes
Dan lurches back All his breath is suddenly gone He falls
back into Herb who tries to catch him as hes falling Dan

hits the ground unable to breathe - his eyes wide with
horror

Herb looks up - the man is gone He looks down to Dan

HERB
Dan Dan You all right Dan

He kneels down and studies his friend He feels for a pulse
in the neck He listens for breathing His friend is dead

HERB (contd)
My God

herself as they pass by She sees La Tijera La Cienega
Venice Boulevard Pico Boulevard Olympic Boulevard Wilshire

and the cab turns left In the middle of the block on the

built during the golden age of cinema

The cab driver puts Bettys bags down on the sidewalk next to
her She can barely stop looking at the building long enough
to pay the cab driver who then goes off and drives away
Betty picks up her bags and enters as if in a dream through
an ornate iron gate to a courtyard with a beautiful working
fountain at its center A sign on a door to her right reads
Manager and she rings the bell

An older once very beautiful woman wearing heavy make-up
and smoking a cigarette in a silver holder opens the door

An unbelievable raspy voice comes out through the dark screen
of the still closed screen door

INT OFFICE ON SIXTH FLOOR

Two men are in the room JOE and ED Joe leans up against a
rack of filing cabinets He is in his late twenties He
looks like a run down heavy metal rocker - wears a blue
denim shirt open T-shirt underneath black denim jeans and
motorcycle boots His black belt has silver studs Hes
smoking a cigarette and is laughing at something the man at
the desk has said His laugh is easy and his grin is
infectious

The man at the desk Ed wears a clean crisp black suit
like a business mans but unlike a business man his blonde
hair is long enough to go over his shoulders

JOE
So man thats unheard of an accident

ED

JOE
Yeah thats a funny story

Looking like hes rubbing the small of his back Joe moves
over to Ed at his desk Joe looks down to the surface of the

desk - to a small worn black book

JOE (contd)
So there it is Eds famous black book
ED
Yeah the history of the world in phone
numbers

Joes hand still at the small of his
holding a silenced pistol and in one
and fires a hole through Eds temple
out across the desk
on the desk

carpet and wall
then is still save the leaking of blood from the

back moves into view
swift move reaches out
- blowing Eds brains
Eds head bangs down

wounds Joe flips his finished cigarette out the open window

behind Eds desk
places the cleaned gun in Eds right

wipes the gun clean with a handkerchief and

hand He places Eds

right forefinger gently onto the trigger As he puts the
finger on the trigger he presses a little too hard and the
gun goes off The bullet shoots out and penetrates the cheap
wall at the far end of Eds office Joe hears a muffled
scream

JOE (contd)
(disgusted with himself)
Ohman

With a sense of just more stuff I got to do Joe moves
slowly and begrudgingly out of Eds office checks the
corridor and goes toward the screaming which still persists
He opens up the office door next to Eds and finds a heavy
set woman screaming bloody murder as she is grabbing her
buttock and lower back He sighs and walks over to her and
cups his hand tightly around her mouth to squelch the
screaming Wide-eyed she tries to fight him off and he
begins dragging her out of her office Joes foot catches on
a computer cable clumsily taped across the floor and he falls
backwards bringing the heavy woman down with a bone-crushing
blow on top of him The woman begins beating his face with
her meaty fists Joe snaps her head back instantly stilling
her violent activity He wrestles the stunned heavyweight
back to her feet and out her door He pushes and pulls her
into Eds office Just before they enter Joe notices a man
with a vacuum cleaner watching him from the far end of the
corridor He stops and calls to the man

JOE (contd)
Hey man Shes hurt bad Get down here
and use the phone Help me out You
gotta call the hospital

The man hesitatesnot sure if this jives with what hes
seeing

JOE (contd)
I mean it Get down here quick Shes
hurt and I cant do everything myself
man

Joe pushes the woman inside Eds office throws a glance back
down the corridor and sees the man is on his way to him
pushing his industrial vacuum and trailing a 200 ft long
thick black cord as he goes Joe goes in to Eds office

with the woman He throws her down on the floor in line
between Eds desk and the bullet hole in the wall She

starts screaming immediately and struggles to get up Joe
grabs the pistol from Eds dead hand and lifts it to fire
but the woman has turned around and is almost standing

JOE (contd)
No no no You gotta be turned around

He goes to her slaps her hard in the face and spins her
around Before she can turn again Joe races back to place
himself in the proper line at Eds desk and quickly fires two
silenced shots into the back of her head The man with the
vacuum enters His eyes begin to widen in reaction to the
scene Just then Joe fires a bullet into the mans chest
The man inadvertently flicks on the vacuum cleaner as his
hands rush up to the wound As the vacuum cleaner whines Joe
rushes to the man before the man falls back out into the
corridor He pulls him into the room - the man moaning and
clutching his chest starting to collapse Joe releases him
and the man goes down The vacuum cleaner seems to be
screeching now in the threshold Joe fires the last bullet
into the heavy duty vacuum cleaner The bullet shorts out
the internal wiring of the vacuum That in turn blows the
buildings circuit breaker and all the lights go out

JOE (contd)
(disgusted with himself)
Oh man

Now he hears voices - voices moving into the corridor

VOICES
What the hell what happened Whats
this cord doing here Its the vacuum
Its the vacuum what did it

Joe cleans the pistol once again and places it back in
Eddies hand - Eddies finger on the trigger Joe picks up
the black book - turns and makes his escape by going out the
office window and quickly descending the rusty fire escape

Luigi Castiglianes espresso is brought in by the man who had
been in earlier The man sets the espresso down in front of
Luigi and takes a step back The room becomes silent -
watching the Espresso Man and Luigi Without looking up Luigi
speaks softly

LUIGI CASTIGLIANE

ESPRESSO MAN

The Espresso Man leaves the room Luigi looks at the
espresso Vincenzo stares at Adam

Adam is doing his best to stare down Vincenzo The Espresso
man returns with a cloth napkin and lays it down next to the
espresso

ESPRESSO MAN (contd)
Will that be all Sir

Luigi doesnt answer and after a moment of standing very
still waiting the Espresso Man turns and leaves the room
Adam is stared down by Vincenzo and averts his eyes to the
espresso cup He looks around at Ray and Mr Darby - seeing
them stare at the espresso cup

Vincenzo keeps staring at Adam

Luigi picks up the napkin and holds it in his left hand

With his right hand he lifts the espresso cup and places it
above the napkin He brings the cup and napkin to his mouth
He takes a sip of espresso A small fleeting expression forms
on Luigis impassive face as if for one millisecond he is
going to vomit His mouth opens and he allows the espresso

to fall and dribble onto the napkin He pushes any remaining
espresso in his mouth out with his tongue He holds it in
that position for a moment

LUIGI CASTIGLIANE
Is shit

Luigi Castigliane stands up

RAY
Im sorry That was a highly
recommended

MR DARBY

espressos in the world Sir

Luigi just stands there A small thread on his left suit
jacket pocket catches his attention and he smooths it back
into the fabric Vincenzo closes his briefcase takes out a
hankerchief and cleans his nose - then stands placing the
handkerchief back in his pocket

ADAM
Wait a minute Whats going on here

Vincenzo just stares toward Adam as if hes not even there

ADAM

Silence
LUIGI CASTIGLIANE

The Castigliane brothers begin to leave Adam stands up
trembling with anger
ADAM

VINCENZO CASTIGLIANE

Castigliane brothers leave As the big blonde wood doors
close behind them Adam starts to boil

ADAM

Rita takes the purse with sudden trepidation She hesitates
Something is worrying her She looks at Betty for help

BETTY
Open it

Rita slowly unzips the purse The pressure of its contents
force the mouth of the purse to widen as the zipper opens and
then there is suddenly revealed what will later be known to
be 12500000 cash in hundred dollar bills

Both Rita and Betty almost stop breathing They look at each
other then back to the money

Rita takes the massive wad of bills out of the purse and sets
it on the bed She reaches back inside and comes up with the
only other remaining item in the purse A BLUE KEY Betty
sees Ritas expression change to a kind of horror

(note This blue key is made of very fine heavy metal and
does not look like a door key)

out a Mont Blanc fountain pen which she puts under Bettys
check as she places it on their table She does this very
quickly but Betty notices this and Diane notices Betty

woman in the blue dress Betty turns and watches a heated
conversation that she cant hear but she sees the woman in
the blue dress searching her purse and shrugging and then

pockets inside out and pats herself down in front of the

goes behind the counter to retrieve an order of food Betty
stops watching and turns her attention to Rita who is tense

down the driveway past Gene the Poolmans truck to the front
door of Adams house Parked at the street is a big limo
with Vincenzo and Luigi Castigliane sitting in the back

Kenny knocks on Adams front door Lorraine answers
Lorraines hands are covered with pink paint Pink paint is

Gene comes out of the kitchen fast his hands covered with
pink paint

Gene grabs hold of Kenny and starts to push him out the door
Kenny rabbit punches Gene in the nose with lightning speed -
his fist like a sledgehammer Gene goes down Lorraine
shrieks and leaps on Kenny Her long fingernails going for
his eyes Kenny slaps Lorraine hard The shriek stops
instantly and she falls out cold on the carpet Gene is back
up and going for Kenny Kenny gets three punches in on Genes
head before Gene hits the ground unconscious Kenny rubs some
pink paint off his hands and tries to get a pink stain off
his jacket He begins walking around the house calling out
for Adam He sees nothing and hears nothing He goes back to
the front door and sees Adams golf clubs sitting there
Kenny begins snapping the shaft of each club As he snaps
each club we see Lorraine and Gene remain out cold on the
floor

And in the kitchen we see that the tap is on and the sink
water is now overflowing from the sink and jewelry box -
spilling out onto the kitchen floor Finishing his work with

stars in the sky above Suddenly some bare bulbs hanging from

Through the darkness Adam hears the sound of a car door
opening and closing then another opening and closing and
then the sound of the car driving away Adam walks up in the
direction the Cowboy took but he sees no sign of a car nor
any dust nor any road He goes back down past the barn and
stables to his car There standing by his Porsche is the

last part of the line across her cheek up to her ear

keeps going down her hips He jerks his hand back Betty
looks down and sees Jimmys hand hovering above her thigh
Betty takes her hand and gently presses down on Jimmys hand
She slowly looks up with the most seductive smile Jimmy

lets his hand rest more firmly on her thigh and squeezes her
thigh as he sees her smile With his other hand Jimmy gently
pulls her closer Something has started coming over Betty
and she catches the drift of this scene in a different way
Shes surprising herself

BETTY
(almost a hot whisper)
Youre playing a dangerous game here if
youre trying to blackmail me its not
going to work

Jimmy now surprises himself He becomes almost tender and
genuinely worked up from the heat coming off Betty

JIMMY
You know what I wantits not that
difficult

Where the scene should turn to anger from Betty it cant now
and Betty plays it as she feels it She stays in very close
to Jimmy - looking him right in the eyes

BETTY
(whispering desperately -
slowly)
Get out Get out before I call my dad
He trusts you youre his best friend

(her arms go around him)
This will be the end of everything

Jimmy gets lost He doesnt know where he is anymore He
can only see Bettys eyes

JIMMY
What about you What will your dad think
about you

Betty still playing it in a dreamy whisper lost in heat
BETTY
Stop just stop Thats what you said

from the beginning If I tell what
happened theyll arrest you and put
you in jail so get out of here before

JIMMY
(caught by her transfixing
sultry eyes and almost
breathless he finds himself
taking an extra long pause)
Before what

As scripted Betty pretends to pull the knife from behind her
back but wraps the knife around behind Jimmy and pulls him
into a kiss

BETTY
(as she kisses him - whispers)
Before I kill you

Jimmy panics and pushes Betty away with his hands on her
shoulders as if forcing himself to come out of a trance He
finally is able to say his line

JIMMY
Then theyd put you in jail

As scripted Betty is supposed to cry now and it is very easy
for her to do this because shes ashamed at how the sex of
the scene took her over Tears begin running down her
cheeks She backs away

BETTY
I hate you I hate us both

She pretends to drop the knife The scene ends

Everyone in the room has become mesmerized by Betty but they
soon drift back to reality and begin applauding the
performance Sarah turns to Nicki

SARAH JAMES
Im going to take her over there

NICKI
Big time

Betty wipes her eyes and turns smiling - still shocked at
herself

of the room and just stands Remnants of the scene still
staying with her

She is passable but not spectacular Adam reaches out and
pulls Hank over to him

HANK

Adam pauses

ADAM

Adam continues to watch Camilla Rhodes sing JASON GOLDWYN

a tall sixty year old silver-haired man comes through the
crowd and stops at Adams side He looks down at Adam but
Adam continues watching Camilla Rhodes Jason follows Adams
gaze and he watches Camilla sing then turns back to Adam
Adam slowly looks up right into Jasons eyes - wondering how
much Jason knows but Jasons face doesnt give away a thing

JASON
Did you want to tell me something Adam

ADAM
This is the girl

At that moment Ray having overheard comes to Jasons side
He smiles at Adam
RAY
Excellent choice Adam

Adam is sick with himself
Across the room Betty panics when she looks at her watch
BETTY
Oh ohI have to be somewhere I

She quickly shakes Sarahs and Nickis hands saying Im

Betty and Rita come out of Aunt Ruths apartment Betty is
laughing pulling on Rita

BETTY
Cmom Theres nothing to be afraid of

Across the courtyard CORNELL DUMONT a strikingly handsome
young black musician is on his balcony playing the
saxophone He stops playing when he sees the girls He
stands and looks as if recognizing someone

CORNELL DUMONT

Betty and Rita stop and look up shielding their eyes from
the sun

Maybe he could help

Betty follows Rita through the gate to the waiting cab They
get in and the cab pulls away

Betty reaches and gently grabs Ritas shoulder She speaks
firmly but quietly so the cab driver wont hear
BETTY
Why didnt you ask him Sol knows you

RITA
(whispering back)
But I dont know Sol I never heard of
Sol Id just get in trouble Thats why
we shouldnt go see about Diane
Selwyn its better not to get in

BETTY
Youre not going to get in trouble
Youre going to find out who you are
Finding out who you are gets you out of
trouble

Rita thinks about this silently then begins to worry and
doubt all over again

DISSOLVE TO
INT CAB - LATER

Betty holds the slip of paper with the address in her hand
She turns back and forth watching the buildings on both sides
of the street

BETTY
It should be around here

Rita watches out of the window pensively as the cab moves up
Sierra Bonita They near a modern apartment compound of
bungalows and duplexes almost hidden in the trees and
vegetation A smooth stucco wall surrounds the complex

BETTY (contd)
(points)
Thats it 2590
(nudging Rita)
Does it look familiar

Rita shakes her headno Rita is looking at a black car
parked down the street facing 2590 She discerns two men
sitting in the front

RITA
Dont stop

BETTY
What is it What do you see
RITA
(quietly - frantic)
Those men in front in the car

BETTY
Do you know them

RITA
No but

BETTY
(to driver)
Keep going Go around to the back

CUT TO
EXT SIERRA BONITA APARTMENT - BACK ALLEY - DAY

Betty gets Rita out of the cab and pays the driver who then
drives away The girls go through a rear gate and enter the
complex walking along a curving concrete walk This leads
them to an intersection where a registry is printed on a
rough hewn wooden plaque They scan the list

BETTY
Selwyn number 12

They both look around the various doors near them Betty
spots a sign which says behind an arrow bungalows 10
through 20

BETTY (contd)
Its this way

They set off down another sidewalk toward Bungalow 12 As
they near it and actually can see it just ahead they pass a
chainlink service gate to the alley Standing in the alley is
aman in a dark suit wearing sunglasses

Both girls dive for the bushes

The man in the black suit turns reacting to the noise and
motion Both girls are trying to catch their breath and stay
as still and quiet as possible

BETTY (contd)
(panting whisper)
Now youve got me scared

Peering through the bushes they see the man still looking in
their direction Suddenly he turns and smiles at something
to his left
He hurries off but soon returns carrying two heavy
suitcases followed by an older woman in a yellow dress
Both Betty and Rita crawl further forward They see the limo
and realize that the man they were afraid of is an ordinary
limousine driver just going about his work The girls stand
up relieved and a little embarrassed

BETTY (contd)
See I told you there was nothing to be
afraid of

They go up to Bungalow 12 and stand for a moment facing the
front door

RITA
Oh no dont

Betty doesnt listen to Rita She knocks strongly on the
door They stand waiting Theres no answer so Betty knocks
again harder They wait

RITA (contd)
No ones

Suddenly the door opens An attractive MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
stands before them

MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN

Yes

BETTY
Diane

MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
Number 17

BETTY
But it said 12

MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
I switched apartments with her Shes in

to the right

The woman seems to be looking now at Rita

MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (contd)
Its kind of hidden by the foliage

Betty and Rita start to leave
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (contd)
She hasnt been around for a few days

BETTY
Well well leave her a note

MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
(starting toward them)
Ill go with you Shes still got some of
my stuff

The phone rings from inside her bungalow

MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (contd)
(turning back)
Oh go ahead Ive got to get that

The woman hurries back inside and closes the door Betty and
Rita quickly move up the walkway toward Bungalow 17

BETTY
I guess youre not Diane

Rita still fighting her fear doesnt answer

They reach Bungalow 17 Its set back beneath tall bushes
and an old Eucalyptus tree The front door is in deep shadow
Without even looking at Rita Betty knocks quickly Theres no
answer She knocks again

BETTY (contd)
Still not home I guess

The girls drift off to the side of the bungalow Betty tries
to see in the windows She tries a window and to her surprise
it opens

RITA
I dont think

BETTY
(looking around for anyone
watching)
Cmon help me in Ill open the front
door
RITA
No

Betty jumps up and catches her knees on the siding her head
through the open window

BETTY
PUSH

Rita reluctantly pushes and Betty is in As she closes the
window

BETTY (contd)
Meet you at the door

Rita walks around to the front door and gets there just as
Betty opens it Betty has her hand over her mouth and nose

BETTY (contd)
I dont know if you want to come in here
or not Theres some kind of horrible
smell like something

Rita is compelled to go in and as the door clicks shut she
reacts to the smell

CUT TO
INT - BUNGALOW 17 - DAY

Betty begins to go through the bungalow and Rita follows
All the blinds are closed and the curtains drawn They move
slowly looking around at everything as they go Betty looks
to Rita to see if any of this is something she remembers
Rita looks as though shes walking in a trance Through the
half light they move deeper into the bungalow to a corridor

Betty and Rita are moving down the corridor They pass a
small room and look in at a couch wardrobe and make-up
table They move on down the corridor to a door which is
almost closed Betty touches the door and it seems to swing
open on its own They enter the room and stop cold A scream
starts to build inside Rita Before them is a dead woman
lying on a bed Great chunks of mattress are standing upright
having been ripped and torn by shotgun blasts A dried sea of
blood surrounds the bloated gray body of the woman The
scream comes out of Rita as a force propelling her to look
closer Betty lunges after Rita her eyes also not able to
leave the sight She covers Ritas mouth with her hand and
brings her close The scream is stifled by Bettys hand

In the silence that follows knocking can be heard Betty
freezes and keeps Rita quiet with her hand still placed over
her mouth but she cant stop Ritas violent shaking nor the
horror in her eyes

CUT TO
EXT BUNGALOW 17 - DAY

The Middle-Aged Woman backs away from the front door looking
around at bungalow 17 Shes not sure if she has heard
something or not She wonders then turns and goes back to
her bungalow

Just as she has disappeared the door to Bungalow 17 flies
open and Rita followed closely behind by Betty runs with a
look of horror directly toward us until her tortured face
fills the screen

Sounds churning music

Great sobs almost hysterical wrack Ritas body as she bends
over the sink scissoring into her long dark hair with a
frenzy There is a loud sound of the scissors cutting deep
through many strands of hair Bettys is rushing to her -

her hands reach tenderly but firmly for Ritas hand holding
the scissors She keeps her from cutting and moves closer
whispering in Ritas ear Rita cant stop crying but lets
Betty hold her Music changes

BETTY
Rita I know what youre doing
RITA
(through uncontrollable sobs)
What IHAVE to do

BETTY
I know what you have to do but let me do
it

Rita turns and looks up at Betty her eyes red with crying
Betty pulls her up facing her Rita lets Betty take the
scissors They look into each others eyes Betty gently
strokes Ritas cheek wiping away some tears

Let me do it

moving up to an empty mirror and eerie music builds The
reflection of the new Rita moves into the mirror She has
short beautiful blonde hair blonde eyebrows and no make-up

out of a deep thought and picks up the receiver as he runs
his hand through strange matted tufts of dirty blonde hair

to the figure It is the bum and the bum sits We move

closer and the bums face fills the screen Its face is
black with fungus Its eyes turn and they seem to be red
