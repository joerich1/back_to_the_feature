THE MOORS - SEVERAL MINUTES LATER

NIGHT has fallen It is very DARK A RELUCTANT Indiana has joined the
Inspector and the other Policemen They LEAD the townspeople along

foggy moors Slowly carefully the villagers SEARCH CREEPING
their faces tense many unable to hide their FEAR A summer wind

an eeire HOWL whistling through the night air Blue MOONLIGHT bathes
the moors creating stark frightening shadows

An expression of ANGER and ANNOYANCE cover Indianas face He

to MacGowan

INDIANA

MACGOWAN

INDIANA

goose chase

MACGOWAN

and a MacGowans word is truer
than an angels kiss
There is a sudden SCREAM One of the villagers STUMBLES UPON
something Everyone GATHERS around the villager

A CORPSE lies before them The body has a somewhat rubbery
appearance

as if all of its bones had been BROKEN The mans pale greenish face

is FROZEN in a hideous grimace Indiana and MacGowan STARE in shock

The woman stops in a CLEARING She is POINTING ahead The villagers
SURROUND her They STARE ahead in the direction where the woman
points Nearly a mile in the distance WE SEE

AN ANCIENT SCOTTISH CASTLE

An enormous 16th CENTURY stone structure Tall forboding towers
lined with menacing GARGOYLES pierce the night sky The castle
appears DESERTED Its interior is completely DARK save for a small
flickering CANDLELIGHT It burns from the castles UPSTAIRS WINDOW

THE CASTLE DOORS

Two enormous wooden doors covered with intricate CARVINGS of demons
serpents and gargoyles adorn the castle entrance Indiana and the
police STAND before the doors Indy GLANCES to the upstairs window
The candle still FLICKERS

A long wooden bar carved into the shape of a SERPENT is fastened
through the metal door latches It BLOCKS the castle entrance Indy
and the Policemen GRAB HOLD of the bar It is extremely HEAVY Using
all of their strength they manage to slide the bar OUT of the door
latches It hits the ground with a THUD rolling down the castle
stairs

Indiana CLUTCHES the rusty metal door handles He PULLS HARD The
doors CREAK GROAN And slowly OPEN A thick CLOUD OF DUST explodes
from inside of the castle It BLOWS OUT all of the torches

Behind the open doors there is only TOTAL DARKNESS Indiana ENTERS
holding the flashlight before him The Policemen exchange FRIGHTENED
glances Inspector MacGowan SHOVES them through the open doors

INT CASTLE

Indys flashlight BEAM glazes over the castles interior It is a
STONE PALACE FILLED with elaborate antique furnishings macabre
sculptures and oil paintings The place is bathed in DUST Thick
COBWEBS fill each corner It is extremely COLD The mens breaths are
VISIBLE Hennesey RUBS his folded arms

HENNESEY
Its deathly cold in ere How could

a human bein survive

Hearing this the other Policemen exchange TERRIFIED glances Indiana
shines his flashlight to a TWISTING STONE STAIRCASE The staircase
spirals upward along a far wall leading to the SECOND FLOOR A FAINT
GLIMMER of light emanates from the top of the stairs Indiana moves
FORWARD The Policemen FOLLOW

Indiana ASCENDS the stairs SLOWLY SILENTLY Toward the LIGHT
MacGowan and the others are directly BEHIND Indy As he makes his way
to the top Indiana examines the bizarre OIL PAINTINGS that line the
wall There are various PORTRAITS and LANDSCAPES depicting

everything

Indiana and Bottomley arrive in a circular CHAMBER located at the

end of the crypt Here the ringing bell is nearly DEAFENING The
sound echoes from ABOVE We are on the floor of the BELL TOWER

that hangs SEVERAL FEET in the air Inside of the bell dangling by
his feet is the DEAD BODY of

HENNESEY He has REPLACED THE BELL CLAPPER His body SWINGS back and

HUNDRED FOOT DROP INTO TOTAL DARKNESS

Indy tries to PULL HIMSELF UP The coffins ancient stone begins to

In desperation Indy SWIMS downward Looking for an ALTERNATE ESCAPE
But there is NO BOTTOM in sight Indys eyes BULGE His face loses
COLOR Only a few precious SECONDS OF LIFE remainwhen suddenly he
SPOTS SOMETHING A SMALL TUNNEL Built into the CAVERN WALL Indiana
hurriedly SWIMS to the tunnel He BOLTS inside

A WATER FOUNTAIN A large THREE TIERED stone structure Instead of
the familiar carvings of angels and beautiful maidens this fountain
is surrounded with water spewing DEMONS GARGOYLES and hellish

CAMERA DOLLIES TO A LARGE METAL DRAIN located inside of the
fountains base The drain cover begins to TURN Suddenly FLIPPING
OPEN Indiana CRAWLS out of the opening He GULPS at the air COLOR
returns to his face LIFE returns to his body Indy RISES to his

A GLISTENING BLACK SUIT OF ARMOR The black knight is nearly SEVEN
FEET TALL It has COME TO LIFE and is walking TOWARD Indy The black

sword begins to swing DOWN Indiana DUCKS and DODGES the deadly

Instead of carving Indiana the knights sword manages to SLICE
perfect sections of the roasted pig The satisfied Baron HELPS

to a freshly carved slice of pork

Indiana LEAPS onto the table top Trying to ESCAPE the living suit of
armor But the white knight CLIMBS up onto the table FOLLOWING Indy

The sword slashing knight PURSUES Indy along the table top Indy
GLANCES upward To the heavy CHANDELIER Indy SMILES A PLAN He
continues to STEP BACKWARD Leading the knight DIRECTLY BELOW the
chandelier

At the precise moment Indy picks up a STERLING SILVER PLATE from the
table top Indy WHISKS the plate in the air Toward the ROPE that
holds the chandelier The spinning plate SEVERS the rope The
chandelier FLIES DOWNWARD1 CRASHING ON TOP of the white knight The
knight lies BENEATH the chandelier MOTIONLESS The sword DROPS from

Rest of us nearly died from

in a near whisper)
We still came back empty handed

MARCUS
(threading the

One mustnt give up so easily

Indiana

INDIANA
Give up Marcus we spent
thirteen months in Chinaanother
seven in India

MARCUS

But none in Africa

INDIANA
(puzzled expression)
There was no proofarcheological
or anthropologicalto indicate
that Sun Wu-Kung ever visited
Africa

MARCUS
Until now

Marcus TURNS OFF the room lights

INDIANA
Hey My papers

Marcus STARTS the projector A BLACK AND WHITE image flickers on the
far wall We see a PYGMY standing in what appears to be a grassy
area The pygmys name is TYKI He is ADORABLE A little Over FOUR
FEET TALL his body is TAUT MUSCULAR His long black hair is SHAGGY
his eyes are WIDE and BRIGHT Almost CHILDLIKE His face is CUTE
IMPISH Covered with a very INQUISITIVE expression Tykis energy is
BOUNDLESS He cannot stop MOVING Standing BESIDE Tyki is

DR CLARE CLARKE 32 years old A tall strikingly BEAUTIFUL woman
She is COMMUNICATING with Tyki in sign language

MARCUS
The woman is Dr Clare Clarke The
famous zoologist She works in
Africa studying animals in their
natural habitat

INDIANA
Very interesting Marcus Now if
youll turn the lights back on --
MARCUS
(continuing)
Three weeks ago Dr Clarke
discovered that cute little
fellow Tykia pygmy of an
unusual raceunrelated to any
known African tribe

INDIANA
(bored)
Marcus The lights

MARCUS
Dr Clarke believes that Tyki comes
from the Lost Civilization of Sun
Wu-Kung

Indiana PAUSES He STANDS walking closer to the flickering image
Suddenly INTERESTED

INDIANA
What But how did Miss --

MARCUS
Doctor

INDIANA

Doctor Clake How did she arrive
at such a preposterous hypothesis

MARCUS
The pygmy speaks in a language that
has no African originsbut bears a
strong resemblance to Chinese

INDIANA
Means nothing The rivers of Africa
have been plagued by various
Oriental Pirates and Scavengers
since the 16th Century
(turns from screen)
Not much evidence Marcus

MARCUS
Theres more The pygmy was found
wearing an ornamental peach stone
around his neckbelieved to come
from Sun Wu-Kungs legendary Garden
Of Immortal Peaches

INDIANA
(skeptical)
Marcus there are countless
undiscovered African tribesall
with various obscure beliefs and
practices
(smirks)
Indiana

One tribe may wear peach stones
another may wear banana peels

Indiana WALKS back to his papers Marcus PAUSES

MARCUS
There is one final bit of
evidence

INDIANA
Enlighten me

MARCUS

The pygmy is over 200 years old

Indiana ADJUSTS his spectacles He STARES at the black and white
image The cute pygmy appears to be in his MID-TWENTIES He walks to
the CAMERA STARING into the lens Tyki examines the camera with

CURIOSITY

CAMERA PANS BACK to the projected image
The picture goes OUT OF FOCUS
TURNS OFF the projector and flips ON t

camera lens

gives Marcus a PUZZLED look

INDIANA
Thats impossible

MARCUS
Dr Clarke has done a considerable
amount of testing on the pygmys
clothinghis sandalseverything
was over 200 years old

INDIANA
(skeptical)
Hes probably wearing his Great
Grandfathers stuff

INDIANA
What does all of this have to do
with me

MARCUS
Dr Clarke wants to mount an
expedition to find the Lost City of
Sun Wu-Kung She is quite familiar
with your reputationshed like
you to come along

INDIANA
(gathering his papers)
No chance

MARCUS
There will be money involved The

Tyki begins to UNSCREW the
The film RUNS OUT Marcus

museum is willing to fund the

expedition

INDIANA
Sorry Marcus Ive burned this
bridge

Indiana TURNS and begins to WALK out of the room Marcus CALLS him

MARCUS

Indy TURNS He WAVES the papers at Marcus

INDIANA
Marcus Please Ive got to finish
these

MARCUS

Youve got to finish something much
more important You crossed the
threshold over a decade agoand
its been tearing at your insides
ever since

(passionate)
My friend if there is even one iota
of truth in Dr Clarkes findings
then you can lift the veil of
mystery that has surrounded this
Chinese legend for Centuries You
may uncover the secrets to a Lost
Civilizationand possibly to
mans never ending search for
immortality

Indiana STARES at the painting of Sun Wu Kung

MARCUS
Indiana Can you afford to pass up
the single most important adventure
of your life

Indiana has NO ANSWER for Marcus Indy PICKS up the painting A

Indiana Jones is SOUND ASLEEP in his bed The rooms porthole
mysteriously SWINGS OPEN The Golden Eagle FLIES inside The eagle
TRANSFORMS back into the Golden Hooped Rod The rod LEANS AGAINST the
wall The moonlight REFLECTS the rod SHINING into Indianas eyes
Indy WAKES He SITS UP and sees the Golden Hooped Rod At first he

SHOCKED He TOUCHES the rodthen comes upon a REALIZATION The
CREAKY VOICE of Sun Wu Kung FILLS the SOUNDTRACK

SUN WU KUNG (VO)
The Golden Hooped Rod will be a
faithful friend It is capable of
one hundred transformationsand
will always remain by your side
Indy STANDS He turns and LOOKS out of the porthole A DREAMY
SATISFIED smile covers Indys face as he stares at the stars ABOVE
SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS CAMERA PULLS BACK TO EXTREMELY LONG SHOT of
the ship SAILING across the ocean

THE END
