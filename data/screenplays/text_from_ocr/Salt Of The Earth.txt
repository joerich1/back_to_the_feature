FADE IN (before titles

EXT QUINTERO BACKYARD MEDIUM SHOT DAY

A woman at work chopping wood Though her back is to the
CAMERA we sense her weariness in toil by the set of her
shoulders A five-year-old girl is helping the woman
gathering kindling Over this scene comes the first
title A guitar dominates the musical theme The motif
is grave nostalgic

EXT QUINTERO BACKYARD A SERIES OF SHOTS DAY

As successive titles appear each is matched by a view of
the woman at her chores Though at no time do see her face
we begin to gather that she is large with child The woman
carries the load of wood to an outdoor fire staggering
under its weight the little girl following with a box of
kindling The woman feeds wood into the fire on top of
which is a washtub She scrubs clothes in the tub bowed
to the work the little girl watching She wrings out
articles of clothing hanging them on a clothesline the
little girl helping gravely

EXT QUINTERO BACKYARD MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT DAY

As the last title fades the woman continues hanging the
wash and for the first time we see her face a mask of
suppression a chiseled yet eroded beauty the eyes hooded
smoldering At the same time though her lips do not move
we hear her voice grave nostalgic cadenced like the
music of the guitar inflecting the melody of
Mexican-American speech

WOMANS VOICE
How shall I begin my story that has no
beginning

MEDIUM FULL SHOT

The clothes billowing in the wind as the woman hangs them
up

WOMANS VOICE

shacks and in deep bg a Catholic church

ESPERANZAS VOICE
This is my village When I was a child

FULLER VISTA SHOT INCLUDING THE MINE ON A HILLTOP

The mine dominates the town like a volcano Its vast cone
of waste has engulfed most of the vegetation on the hill
and seems to threaten the town itself

ESPERANZAS VOICE
The Anglos changed the name to Zinc Town
Zinc Town New Mexico USA

EXT CHURCH CEMETERY MEDIUM SHOT DAY
An ancient graveyard beside a Catholic church
ESPERANZAS VOICE
Our roots go deep in this place deeper than the
pines deeper than the mine shaft

EXT COUNTRYSIDE LONG PAN SHOT DAY

We see great scudding clouds and the jagged skyline of a
mountain spur The mountain is scarred and pitted by old
diggings The lower slope is a skirt of waste the grey
powdery residue of an abandoned mine

ESPERANZAS VOICE
In these arroyos my great grandfather
raised cattle before the Anglos ever
came

packed into the rock face of a narrow drift There are a
dozen such fuses The drift is lighted only by the lamp on
Ramons hat

ESPERANZAS VOICE
Living half his life with dynamite and
darkness

CLOSE-UP A FUSE

only a bobbing lamp and the long shadow of a man running
We see a flash of light hear muffled thunder

EXT BACKYARD MEDIUM SHOT DAY

Esperanza has paused a moment in her work looking off
toward the mine with a worried frown Now she picks up the
heavy clothes-basket and walks toward the cottage The
little Estella is not in sight

ESPERANZAS VOICE
Who can say where it began my story I
do not know But this day I remember as
the beginning of an end

INT QUINTERO KITCHEN MEDIUM SHOT DAY

It is no more than a narrow passageway dominated by an
ancient wood-burning stove There is no running water
Esperanza sets the basket down beside an ironing board
picks up an iron from the stove and tests it with a
moistened finger

ESPERANZAS VOICE
It was my Saints Day I was thirty-five
years old A day of celebration And I
was seven months gone with my third child

Estella has run into shot presenting her mother with a
rose Esperanza pins the rose in Estellas hair with a
small smile then returns to her ironing As she irons
her face becomes more and more desolate

ESPERANZAS VOICE
And on that day -- I remember I had a
wish a thought so sinful

In a convulsive gesture her fingers go to her lips She drops
the iron and hurries from the kitchen

INT PARLOR MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT AT SHRINE

We see only a corner of the small cramped parlor where
Esperanza with bowed head and clenched hands stands
before a shrine to the Virgin

ESPERANZAS VOICE
a thought so evil that I prayed God
to forgive me for it I wished I
wished that my child would never be born
No Not into this world

Esperanza covers her face with her hands The little girl
enters scene stares gravely at her

ESTELLA

As Esperanza starts ironing again her son Luis enters by
the back door A handsome boy of 13 but now panting and
bedraggled he pours himself a glass of water and gulps it
down Esperanza watches him sidelong

ESPERANZA
Fighting again
(No response)
With those Anglo kids

LUIS
Aah they think theyre tough
ESPERANZA
But you promised you wouldnt

LUIS
(unrepentant)
Papa says if an Anglo makes fun of you to
let him have it

Esperanza suddenly seizes his shoulder spinning him around
as if about to slap him crying simultaneously

ESPERANZA
Never mind what your papa

For the first time she (and we) see that the boys mouth is
bleeding Her anger is washed away in a wave of concern
and she picks up a cloth and wipes the blood

ESPERANZA
Hold still does it hurt

LUIS
(pulling away)
Naah

He spies a birthday cake on the drainboard sticks his
finger in the icing

LUIS
How come the cake

Esperanza grabs the cake puts it in the cupboard

EXT DELAWARE ZINC CO MINE LONG SHOT DAY

The miners stop as Barton hands in his hip pockets blocks
their way Barton is a rangy Texan with a perpetual
half-smile on his lips Ramon the miners spokesman is
rugged handsome younger in appearance than Esperanza
although he is a year older There is a smoldering
intensity in his manner and speech During the following
the boy Luis enters scene coming up behind his father

The men ignore him

The other miners step forward in support of Ram√©n They

JENKINS

followed by Estella who carries her own plate As

holding a candle over the frosting of the cake on the
drainboard

ESTELLA

ESPERANZA
(a fierce whisper)
Hush not a word about the cake hear

INT PARLOR FULL SHOT

The room is small cramped The plaster walls are cracked
and peeling Most of the furnishings are faded and old
Nevertheless the cottage is tidy and gives evidence of
considerable care A dilapidated couch is covered with a
fine Mexican blanket In one corner of the room stands a

DISSOLVE
shrine to the Virgin A vase of fresh-cut flowers stands
on the mantlepiece beneath a framed portrait of Benito
Juarez The only item of splendor in the room is a
high-polished radio-phonograph console Over scene we hear
a tin-pan-alley compost of Western music sung by cowboy
entertainers

Ramon sits with Luis at a small table near the kitchen
door Esperanza enters with the coffee pot pours his
coffee Estella follows her climbing onto her fathers
lap

LUIS
Papa is there gonna be a strike

Ramon ignores the question brooding Esperanza who would
also like to hear an answer watches his face as he sips
his coffee

ESPERANZA
(finally timidly)
Ramon I dont like to bother you
but the store lady said if we dont make
a payment on the radio this month
theyll take it away

Ramons forehead falls against his upraised palm as if to
say its too much to bear The little girl looks at him
gravely

ESPERANZA
Were only one payment behind I argued
with her It isnt right

RAMON
(softly imploring heaven)
It isnt right she says Was it right
that we bought this this instrument

He rises holding Estella

RAMON
But you had to have it didnt you It
was so nice to listen

ESPERANZA
(quietly)
I listen to it Every night When
youre out to the beer parlor

Ignoring this mild rebuke Ram√©n crosses to the radio
CAMERA PANS with him He glares at the console mimicking
an announcers commercial

RAMON
No money down Easy term payments I
tell you something this installment
plan its the curse of the working man

He slams his coffee cup down on the console sets his
daughter down and goes to the kitchen Esperanza quickly
polishes the console where he struck it

INT KITCHEN MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

Ramon strips to the waist pours some water from the tub on
the stove into a pan on the drainboard Esperanza appears
in the doorway watching him her heart sinking Her fingers
go to her lips in a characteristic gesture

ESPERANZA
Where you going

RAMON
Got to talk to the brothers

Esperanza bites her finger trying to hide her
disappointment Ram√©n bends over the pan to wash He has
not noticed the cake Esperanza picks it up quickly hides
it in a cupboard Ramon splashes his face and neck with
water looks up in irritation

RAMON
This waters cold again

ESPERANZA
Im sorry The fires gone out

She begins to stoke the stove

RAMON
Forget it

ESPERANZA
Forget it I chop wood for the stove
five times a day Every time I remember
I remember that across the tracks the
Anglo miners have hot water in pipes And
bathrooms Inside

RAMON
(bitterly)
Do you think I like living this way
What do you want of me

He reaches for a towel Esperanza hands him one

ESPERANZA
But if your union if youre asking for
better conditions why cant you ask

for decent plumbing too

Frustrated evasive Ram√©n turns away buttoning his shirt
RAMON
We did It got lost in the shuffle

ESPERANZA
What

RAMON
(shrugging)
We cant get everything at once Right
now weve got more important demands

ESPERANZA
(timidly)
Whats more important than sanitation

RAMON
(flaring)
The safety of the men -- thats more
important Five accidents this week --
all because of speed-up Youre a woman
you dont know what its like up there

She bows her head without answering and picks up the heavy
tub of water on the stove Unassisted she lugs it to the

dishpan in the sink and fills it Ramdn begins to comb his
hair adding in a more subdued tone

RAMON
First we got to get equality on the job
Then well work on these other things
Leave it to the men

ESPERANZA
(quietly)
I see The men Youll strike maybe for
your demands -- but what the wives want

that comes later always later

RAMON
(darkly)
Now dont start talking against the union
again
ESPERANZA

(a shrug of defeat)
What has it got me your union

Ramon looks at her in amazement not with anger but with
deep concern

RAMON
Esperanza have you forgotten what it was
like before the union came
(Points toward parlor)
When Estella was a baby and we couldnt
even afford a doctor when she got sick
It was for our families We met in
graveyards to build that union

ESPERANZA

(lapsing into despair)
All right Have your strike Ill have
my baby But no hospital will take me
because Ill be a strikers wife The
store will cut off our credit and the
kids will go hungry And well get
behind on the payments again and then
theyll come and take away the radio

RAMON
(furiously)
Is that all you care about That radio
Cant you think of anything except
yourself

ESPERANZA
(breaking)
If I think of myself its because you
never think of me Never Never Never

The place is lighted by a neon sign From within we hear a
juke box playing ersatz Mexican music The boy approaches
the door pauses and eenters

INT BEER PARLOR FULL SHOT NIGHT

QUICK
It is nondescript small dingy dimly lighted
indistinguishable from a hundred other small-town bars A
half dozen miners including Antonio Morales Sebastian
Prieto and Alfredo Diaz stand at the bar rail drinking
beer The bartender is an Anglo We hear

We know its not safe for miners to work alone
The boss will always tell you things like that

Luis has reached a post near a table at the far end of the
room Four men are seated around the table Sal Ruiz Frank
Barnes Charley Vidal and Ramon -- whose back is to Camera
Sal is drinking coffee the other three are drinking beer
Luis stops and as CAMERA MOVES IN ON GROUP we pick up

RAMON
(angrily)
They dont work alone in other mines
Anglos always work in pairs So why
should I risk my life Because Im only a

Mexican

SAL AND CHARLEY
But thats in the demands were
negotiating

RAMON

Three months of negotiations And
nothing happens

Even with Brother Barnes here from the
International whatve we got

No raise No seniority No safety code
Nothing

REVERSE ANGLE SHOOTING TOWARD RAMON

Morales have approached the table Antonio sets a fresh
bottle of beer before Ramon

ANTONIO
Take a drink Calm down

RAMON
(to Frank ignoring Antonio)
I say we gotta take action Now

FRANK
Rest of the men feel like you

Ramon glances over his shoulder at the standing miners
Sebastian glances uncertainly at Antonio
ANTONIO
(firmly)
He speaks for all of us

CHARLEY
Ever stop to think maybe they want us to
strike

RAMON
Dont horse me Price of zincs never
been higher They dont want no strike --
not with their war boom on

FRANK
Then whys the company hanging tough
Theyve signed contracts with other
locals -- why not this one

RAMON
(strikes the table)
Because most of us here are Mexican-
Americans Because we want equality with
Anglo miners -- the same pay the same
conditions

FRANK
Exactly And equalitys the one thing the
bosses cant afford The biggest club
they have over the Anglo locals is Well
-- at least you get more than the
Mexicans

RAMON
Okay so discrimination hurts the Anglo
too but it hurts me more And Ive had
enough of it

SAL
But you dont pull a strike when the
bosses want it -- so they can smash your

union You wait till youre ready so you
can win

RAMON
Do the bosses wait No sanitation So my
kids get sick Does the company doctor
wait Twenty bucks So we miss one
payment on the radio I bought for my
wife Does the company store wait Pay
-- or we take it away Why they in such
a hurry the bosses store Theyre

trying to scare us thats why -- to make
us afraid to move To hang on to what we
got -- and like it Well I dont like
it Im not scared and Im fed up --

standing before the silent miners Barton realizes that
the men are not looking at him but at something above and
beyond him Barton looks over his shoulder Alexander
slowly follows suit
FROM THEIR ANGLE LONG SHOT THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
standing on the knoll above the mine They are silent and
grave The womens skirts billow in the wind like unfurled
flags like the tattered banners of a guerrilla band that
has come to offer its services to the regular army

EXT UNION HALL SHOOTING PAST SHERIFFS CAR NIGHT

The car is parked provocatively near the entrance to the
building A sign over the doorway lighted by reflectors
identifies the place as the union hall From within we hear
the muted tumult of a packed house In near fg is another
parked car containing several women and children

ESPERANZAS VOICE
That night the men held a union meeting
just to make the walk-out official

Suddenly we hear a roar of applause from inside the hall
The door opens Luis and a tow-headed youngster come
bounding out run toward the car CAMERA PANNING with them

ESPERANZAS VOICE
It didnt take them long They voted to
strike -- 93 to 5

We see the car door open Ruth Barnes and Teresa emerge
from the front seat Consuelo holding a sleeping infant
gets out of the back Esperanza is the last to appear
Estella is asleep in her arms

ESPERANZAS VOICE
And Teresa said now was the time for
us to go in I didnt want to I had
never been to a union meeting But the
others said one go all go

We see the women coaxing Esperanza She follows them
reluctantly toward the union hall

FULL SHOT NIGHT INT UNION HALL

as seen from the entrance A hundred miners are packed
densely on the center block of benches facing the union
officers in bg Sal Ruiz is presiding Frank Barnes sits
at the table beside him Charley Vidal stands near the
chairman delivering an impassioned speech

CHARLEY VIDAL
We have many complaints brothers and
many demands But they all add up to one
word Equality
Over sound track we hear the Spanish of Charleys speech
but it is modulated to

ESPERANZAS VOICE
The meeting was nearly over when we came
in Charley Vidal was making a speech
He said there was only one issue in this
strike -- equality But the mine owners
would stop at nothing to keep them from
getting equality

THE HALL ANOTHER ANGLE INCLUDING THE WOMEN

The men are so intent on Charley Vidals speech that they
do not notice the entrance of the women who tip-toe
unobtrusively to the side of the room where they take seats
on the unoccupied wall bench Estella wakes up blinking in
the bright lights

THE HALL FULL SHOT FEATURING CHARLEY

ESPERANZAS VOICE
He said the bosses would try to split the
Anglo and Mexican-American workers and
offer rewards to one man if he would sell
out his brother There was only one
answer to that Charley said -- solidarity
The solidarity of working men

Charley concludes his speech

CHARLEY VIDAL
To all this brothers there is only one
answer the solidarity of working men

He sits down to loud applause which comes up over sound
track Sal Ruiz rises bangs his gavel

GROUP SHOT THE WOMEN

Ruth and Teresa nudge Consuelo trying to get her to rise
-- but Consuelo frightened clings to her sleeping infant
Ruth grabs the baby and Teresa practically pushes Consuelo
to her feet

WIDER ANGLE SHOOTING PAST SAL INCLUDING WOMEN

Charley Vidal plucks at Sals sleeve points in the
direction of the women

SAL
Yes You ladies have an announcement

CONSUELO
(haltingly)
Well -- its not an announcement I guess
The ladies wanted me to

VOICE FROM THE FLOOR
Louder

SAL
Consuelo will you speak from over here

Painfully self-conscious Consuelo moves toward camera in
fg She faces the men and begins again nervous but
trying to speak louder

CONSUELO
The ladies have been talking about
sanitation and we were thinking

if the issue is equality like you say it
is then maybe we ought to have equality
in plumbing too

CLOSE GROUP SHOT MINERS

Some appear resentful of the womens intrusion others seem
amused Antonio whispers something to Alfredo Alfredo
laughs Frowning Ram√©n looks around at Esperanza as he
might look at a woman who entered church uncovered

CONSUELOS VOICE
I mean maybe it could be a strike demand
and some of the ladies thought -- it
might be a good idea to have a ladies
auxiliary Well we would like to help
out if we can

FULL SHOT THE HALL FEATURING CONSUELO

We hear mild scattered applause and then a male falsetto
giggle sets off a wave of laughter Ruiz rises grins
sheepishly Consuelo hurries back to her seat CAMERA HOLDS

SAL
Im sure I can speak for all of the
brothers We appreciate the ladies
offering to help but its getting late
and I suggest we table it The chair
will entertain a motion to adjourn

FIRST MINER

Move to adjourn

SECOND MINER

SAL
So ordered

He brings down his gavel and the meeting ends Some of the
miners break for the door others begin to mill about
Ruth and Consuelo walk to the front of the hall Now in
quick succession we see four vignettes

TWO SHOT SAL AND CONSUELO

He meets her near the speakers table flings out his arms
in a helpless gesture

SAL
Why didnt you check with me Its
embarrassing

TWO SHOT RUTH AND FRANK

She leans across the speakers table before Frank can rise
and remarks acidly

RUTH
Why didnt you support her Youre the
worst of the lot

FRANK
But honey

RUTH
Or why dont you just put a sign outside

No dogs or women allowed

ANOTHER PART OF THE HALL CHARLEY AND TERESA

CHARLEY
But Teresa you cant push these things
too fast
TERESA
(fiercely)
You were pushing all right -- pushing us

right back in our place
ESPERANZA AND RAMON NEAR DOORWAY
Esperanza is holding Estella who is asleep again Ram√©n is
at the rear of a group of miners filing out of the hall As
two of the miners pass Camera we hear one say to the other
FIRST MINER
Thats a pretty good idea -- making

sanitation one of the demands again

As Ramon moves into fg he indicates with the slightest
of gestures for Esperanza to follow She obeys

EXT UNION HALL MEDIUM PANNING SHOT NIGHT

Ramon emerges from the hall moves to a corner of the
building in fg Esperanza joins him there in the darkness
Ramon speaks softly

RAMON
At least you didnt make a fool of
yourself -- like Consuelo
SLOW

DISSOLVE TO
EXT PICKET LINE LONG ESTABLISHING SHOT
This panorama should be as inclusive as the location site
permits Thirty or more miners march counter-clockwise on
a dirt road Beyond this elliptical picket line on either
side of the road are two signs

DELAWARE ZINC CO INC

KEEP OUT

MINERS ON STRIKE

WE WANT EQUALITY
Though the area is unfenced these signs mark an imaginary
boundary But access to the mine is difficult except by way
of the road To the right of the road is a steep wooded
hillside The road skirts this hill till it reaches the
mountain of waste in deep bg then winds uphill to the
knoll on which the mine stands To the left of the road is
a railroad spur and a gully The gully is bridged by
trestles beyond which a fork of the road leads to Zinc
Town Two sheriffs cars are parked on the road near the
picket post No women are visible in this scene

ESPERANZAS VOICE

And so it began -- much like any other

strike There would be no settlement

the company said till the men returned

to their jobs But their back-to-work

movement didnt work

WIPE TO

THE PICKET LINE CLOSER ANGLE

Two open touring cars loaded with strike-breakers slowly
approach the picket line The lead car stops before this
human wall The pickets make no menacing gestures but
they are ominous in massed silence

ESPERANZAS VOICE
And so the company recruited a few

strike-breakers from out of town

We see the lead car make a U-turn and withdraw the way it
came It is followed by the second car

ESPERANZAS VOICE
But they usually lost their nerve when
they saw the size of the picket line

ANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING SHERIFFS CARS

parked near the picket line A half-dozen deputies stand
around idly They are khaki-clad booted wearing their
Stetsons with the brims rolled up They display their
side-arms ostentatiously their holsters hanging low in the
fashion of storybook gunmen

ESPERANZAS VOICE
The Sheriffs men were always there They
stood around showing off their weapons
But the men only marched day after day
week after week

WIPE TO
EXT ROAD OUTSIDE QUINTERO COTTAGE FULL SHOT DAY
Charley Vidal and another miner stand in the back of a
pick-up distributing rations to Esperanza and Luz Morales
The small sacks contain beans corn meal coffee etc
ESPERANZAS VOICE

At first it was a kind of unwritten rule

that the women stay at home The union

gave us rations and we had to figure out

how to feed our families on them
EXT PICKET LINE MEDIUM SHOT DAY
There are fewer pickets now and the miners weary of the
monotony march in a more leisurely fashion We see Mrs
Salazar (the old lady introduced at the mafianita) standing
close by the picket line She is crocheting Ramon the
picket captain and other miners glance uncomfortably at
her

ESPERANZAS VOICE

But then one morning Mrs Salazar went to

the picket line Her husband had been

killed in a strike many years before

and she wanted to be there

WIPE TO

THE PICKET LINE MATCHING SHOT ON ANOTHER DAY

Mrs Salazar is now marching with the men She is still
crocheting Her expression of calm determination is
unchanging

ESPERANZAS VOICE
Nobody remembers just how it happened
but one day Mrs Salazar started marching
with them and she kept on marching
with them

WIPE TO

THE PICKET POST ANOTHER ANGLE

We see Teresa Vidal standing beside an old jalopy pouring
a cup of coffee for her husband

ESPERANZAS VOICE
After a while some of the women began to
bring coffee for their husbands and
maybe a couple of tacos -- because a man
gets tired and hungry on picket duty

WIPE TO

THE PICKETS GROUP SHOT

Several pickets gape ravenously at Antonio as he bites into
the tacos given him by Luz

ESPERANZAS VOICE
It was about that time the union decided
maybe theyd better set up a Ladies
Auxiliary after all

WIPE TO

THE PICKET POST ANOTHER ANGLE

and another day A number of miners have turned carpenter
erecting a shack of scrap lumber and galvanized tin close
by the picket line Several women have set up a table
outside the unfinished shack on which we see a pot of
beans a coffee pot etc Esperanza is not among them

WIPE TO
EXT COFFEE SHACK MEDIUM SHOT DAY

The shack is now complete We see Ramon approach the
doorway where a woman hands him a cup of coffee He tastes
it makes a wry face

ESPERANZAS VOICE
I didnt come to the lines at first My
time was near -- and besides Ramon
didnt approve But Ramon is a man who
loves good coffee And he swore the
other ladies made it taste like zinc
sludge

WIPE TO

MATCHING SHOT THE COFFEE SHACK FEATURING ESPERANZA
Standing in the doorway her pregnancy is more evident than
ever But her face is alight with one of her rare smiles as
she pours a cup of coffee and hands it to Ramon Estella
can be seen peeking out from behind her mothers skirt

So one day I made the coffee

back-to-work movement Jenkins he says
why string along with them tamale
eaters I just told him I come to like

The men laugh Ramon smiles but the look he gives Jenkins
is tinged with speculative suspicion Just then a patrol

of three miners led by Alfredo Diaz enters scene from the
hillslope Alfredo reports to Ram√©n He is breathing hard

ALFREDO
Two scabs got through on the other side
of the hill We chased the rest back

RAMON
Recognize them

ALFREDO
(shaking head)

As the three men of the patrol walk off to the coffee
shack one of the miners on the picket line calls out

and roving patrols

REVERSE PANNING SHOT THEIR ANGLE

ALEXANDER
Hows it going

SHERIFF
Well those new fellows you hired from
out of town -- we brought em up here in

SHERIFF
(skeptically)
Well Mr Hartwell theyve got some
pretty tough hombres specially that
picket captain there -- whats his name
Ray Raymond something-or-other

ALEXANDER
Oh yes I know that one

He shifts into gear and drives off The Sheriff touches his
Stetson courteously

BACK TO PICKET LINE

The men are marching now moving in a tight ellipse across
the road Kalinsky hobbles along beside them on his
crutches Ramon stands in the middle of the road facing
the picket line his back to the approaching Cadillac He
lectures the men with mock severity

RAMON
Now why dont you let these gentlemen
pass Dont you know whos in that car

ANTONIO
(shouting)
Its the paymaster from Moscow -- with
our gold
RAMON
No no its the president of the company
himself -- come all the way out here to

make Jenkins general manager So why you
acting so mean

The miners grin as they march one of them slapping Jenkins
on the back

INT CADILLAC TWO SHOT THROUGH WINDSHIELD

The car is halted again and the picket line can be seen in
bg Alexander is used to this treatment but Hartwell is
annoyed

HARTWELL
Arent they going to let us pass

ALEXANDER
Eventually This is just a little ritual
to impress us with their power

HARTWELL
Childish

ALEXANDER
Well theyre like children in many ways
Sometimes you have to humor them

sometimes you have to spank them -- and
sometimes you have to take their food
away

(Points off scene)
Here comes the one we were talking about

We see Ramon leave the picket line and come toward the car
He is still sipping his coffee Alexander chuckles

ALEXANDER
Hes quite a character Claims his
grandfather once owned the land where the
mine is now
Both men laugh
ANOTHER ANGLE AT CAR

as Ramon comes up He leans down and peers inside

RAMON
(politely)
Want to go up to your office Mr
Alexander
ALEXANDER

(a half-smile)
Naturally You think I parked here for a
cup of coffee

RAMON
Youre welcome to one

ALEXANDER

RAMON
Too bad The menve always wanted to get

(eagerly)
But youve come out here to settle the
strike
HARTWELL
(shrugging)

Well if thats possible

RAMON
Its possible Just negotiate

HARTWELL
(coolly to Alexander)
Are we talking to a union spokesman

ALEXANDER
Not exactly But I wish he were one He
knows more about mining than those
pie-cards weve had to deal with

Hartwell is unprepared for Alexanders gambit -- but a mask
falls suddenly over Ram√©ns face Alexander looks at Ramon
continuing with all the sincerity he can muster

ALEXANDER
I mean it I know your work record You
were in line for foreman when this trouble
started -- did you know that You had a
real future with this company but you
let those Reds stir you up And now
theyll sell you down the river Why
dont you wake up Ray

(A pause)
Thats your name isnt it Ray

RAMON
No My name is Quintero Mister Quintero

There is a moments silence Alexander compresses his lips
chagrined at the rebuff

ALEXANDER
Are you going to let us pass -- or do I
have to call the Sheriff

RAMON
Theres nothing stopping you

He steps back indicating
THE ROAD FROM THEIR ANGLE

The road is clear The pickets are no longer marching but
are lined up facing each other on both sides of the road
We hear the Cadillac accelerate It plunges forward into
scene moves on past the pickets in a cloud of dust Ramon

bellows at the miners

The CAMERA ANGLE is that of a standing kibitzer Ramon is
nearest the kitchen Around him clockwise sit Antonio Sal
Charley and Frank Sal is dealing the fifth card of a stud
poker hand The play is continuous and fast a counterpoint
to the more serious discussion

ESPERANZAS VOICE

Her voice fades and now we hear
CHARLEY

(throwing in matches)
Five thousand dollars

FRANK

figure if they can lock up the leadership
on some phony riot charge maybe they can
bust the strike

her foot restlessly to the radio music which continues over
scene

RUTH
With any of them -- even my own

LUZ

She grabs Ruth and dances her around in a lascivious parody
of Antonios style The women giggle Esperanzas head
turns at the sound of an infants wail

INT PARLOR AT THE POKER TABLE

workers and Anglo bosses

RAMON
(indicating Frank
Hes a guest in my house isnt he

SAL
Sure But you want the truth Youre
even suspicious of him

RAMON
Maybe I think hes got a few things to
learn about our people

There is a rather uneasy pause Esperanza is seen
re-crossing from bedroom to kitchen the baby in her arms
Frank continues shuffling

FRANK
Go on Spill it
RAMON
(slowly)
Well youre the organizer You work out
strike strategy -- and most of the time

youre dead right But when you figure
everything the rank-and-files to do down
to the last detail you dont give us
anything to think about You afraid were
too lazy to take initiative

FRANK
(defensively)
You know I dont think that

RAMON
Maybe not But theres another thing
like when you came in tonight --
(indicates picture)
I heard you ask your wife Whos that

Ramon a friendly criticism and he throws
it right back in your face

FRANK

FRANK

FRANK

RUTH
(to Ramon)

Ramon laughs Ruth turns back to him

RUTH

Not that I like the way you treat your
wife But when Doctor Barnes gives you
his cure-all for female troubles ask him

if hes tried it at home
RAMON
(grinning)
Hey Esperanza

RUTH
Esperanzas nursing the baby

A glow of eagerness brightens Ramd√©ns face He flings down
the cards and goes out to the kitchen The exasperated
Antonio tosses his cards aside

ANTONIO
There goes the game

LUZ
Good Consuelo turn up the radio
(To Antonio)
Come on Papa on your feet

Antonio gets up and begins to dance with his wife We mark
how accurate a parody his wife made of his style Charley
dances with Teresa Ruth folds her arms glaring at Frank

INT KITCHEN CLOSE TWO SHOT

Ramon stands beside his wife looking over her shoulder at
the suckling child The CAMERA AhANGLE is such that we
cannot see Juanito

RAMON
(proudly)
Look at him

Ramon clenches his fists tenses his forearms grunts
approvingly

RAMON
A fighter huh

ESPERANZA
He was born fighting And born hungry

RAMON
Drink drink Juanito Youll never have
it so good

ESPERANZA
Hell have it good Some day

For a moment they say nothing watching the baby Then
with a sidelong worried glance

ESPERANZA
What were they saying About you In there

RAMON
They say I am no good to you
ESPERANZA

(shrugs)
You are no good to me -- in jail
RAMON
(musing)

Id lie on my cot in the cell and I
couldnt sleep with the bugs and the
stink and the heat And Id say to myself
think of something nice Something
beautiful And then Id think of you And
my heart would pound against the cot for
love of you

Esperanza is deeply moved but she does not show him her
face Ram√©ns face becomes tense with determination

RAMON
(half-whispering)
Not just Juanito Youll have it good too
Esperanza Were going to win this

strike
ESPERANZA
What makes you so sure
RAMON
(brooding)

Because if we lose we lose more than a
strike We lose the union And the men
know this And if we win we win more
than a few demands We win

(groping for words)
something bigger Hope Hope for our
kids Juanito cant grow strong on milk
alone

His words are shattered by a loud knock at the front door
Ramon turns listening We hear the door open and voices
indistinctly CAMERA HOLDS On Ram√©n and Esperanza

INT PARLOR FULL SHOT

Everyone is standing Several armed deputies stand around
the radio console ready to move it but checked
momentarily by Ramon Kimbroughs right hand is on the butt
of his revolver Esperanza enters scene In one continuous
movement she hands the baby to Consuelo and blocks Ramon
clutching him and speaking with a new-found fierceness

ESPERANZA
Let them take it

RAMON
Over my dead body

ESPERANZA

I dont want your dead body I dont want
you back in jail either

RAMON
But its yours I wont let them

ESPERANZA
(savagely in Spanish)
Cant you see they want to start a fight
so that they can lock you all up at one
time

Slowly Ram√©n goes lax and Esperanza relaxes her hold on

him The deputies pick up the heavy console lug it toward
the front door The Quinteros guests are glum and silent
The deputies leave closing the door behind them

RAMON
(bitterly)

What are you so sad about

He crosses to a shelf picks up a dusty guitar and tosses it
to Sal

RAMON
Lets hear some real music for a change

Sal grins He begins to improvise as we

EXT MINE AND PICKET POST LONG PANORAMIC SHOT DAY

In the distance we can see the tiny figures of the strikers
maintaining their vigil on the picket line Behind them
looms the lifeless head frame of the mine

ESPERANZAS VOICE
But the strike did not end Ramon was
wrong It went on and on into the fourth
month the fifth the sixth The company
still refused to negotiate We couldnt
buy food at the company store

EXT STORE WINDOW MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT DAY

A Mexican-American woman is looking at a display of canned

THE PICKET LINE MEDIUM SHOT DAY

A dozen or so pickets march counter-clockwise in a
leisurely fashion Antonio holds an unfolded newspaper
which he appears to be reading to the others but we hear

ESPERANZAS VOICE
They tried to turn the Anglo millers
against us They said that all the
Mexicans ought to be sent back where they
came from But the men said

Esperanzas voice fades and now we hear from the picket
line

ANTONIO
(slapping newspaper)
How can I go back where I came from The
shack I was born in is buried under
company property

KALINSKY
Why dont nobody ever tell the bosses to
go back where they came from

CENTE

Mexico if they did

ALFREDO

ANTONIO

They all start laughing pummeling Jenkins as they march

on a dirt road outside an adobe house The car is piled
high with the belongings of a Mexican-American family The
mother and her children are in the car The man is shaking
hands with the neighbors in a sad goodbye

ESPERANZAS VOICE
And the seventh month came By now the
strike fund was nearly gone A few
families couldnt take it any longer
They packed up and moved away -- and
where they went we do not know

INT UNION HALL MEDIUM SHOT AT DESK DAY

Sal and Charley are seated behind the desk A number of
miners stand opposite them One by one the miners count
out money hand it to the union officers Ramd√©n stands
nearby watching
ESPERANZAS VOICE
And so it was decided by the union that
hardship cases should seek work in other
mines And this was done And the
strikers who found jobs divided their pay
with the union so the rest of us might
eat

INT QUINTERO COTTAGE MEDIUM SHOT EVENING

The Quintero family is seated at the table Their plates
are empty Esperanza picks up a bowl containing two
spoonfuls of beans She divides them among the children

ESPERANZAS VOICE
Ramon was not a hardship case Only three
children to feed No -- the Quintero
family was not hungry all the time Just
most of the time

EXT UNION HALL FULL SHOT A TRUCK DAY

Two men stand in the back of the truck handing down cases
of food to the miners One of the men in the truck is a
Negro When Charley Vidal comes over the Negro leans down
and shakes his hand warmly

ESPERANZAS VOICE
Even so the mine owners might have
starved us out were it not for the help
we got from our International in Denver
and from the other locals And we who
thought no one outside our county knew of
our troubles or cared if they did know
-- found we were wrong

INT UNION HALL CLOSE SHOT AT DESK DAY

The desk is piled high with mail Sal and Frank are opening
it We see dollar bills loose change checks

ESPERANZAS VOICE
Letters came From our own people the
Spanish-speaking people of the Southwest

till the day of the crisis

FULL SHOT THE UNION HALL

The Sheriff a US Marshall and several deputies appear
suddenly in the entrance to the hall They cross the room
to Sal Ruiz desk The Sheriff is grinning broadly

ESPERANZAS VOICE
That was the day when the Sheriff and the
Marshall came The Sheriff was smiling --
so we knew he brought bad news

CLOSER ANGLE GROUP AT TABLE

Sal takes the paper reads it gravely The Sheriff grins
triumphantly and leaves followed by his entourage

ESPERANZAS VOICE
The company had got a court injunction
ordering the strikers to stop picketing
A Taft-Hartley injunction they called it
It meant heavy fines and jail sentences
for the strikers if they disobeyed

Sal rises slowly re-reading the court order as Frank and
Charley join him reading over his shoulder Their faces
express worry defeat

ESPERANZAS VOICE
A decision had to be made at once --
whether to obey the order or not
WIPE
INT UNION HALL FULL PANNING SHOT NIGHT
The hall is packed The striking miners as usual occupy

the center bloc of seats But this time there are almost as
many women as men in the hall They sit with their

children in the rear or on benches against the side walls
CAMERA HOLDS on Frank Barnesstanding at the front of the
hall addressing the miners

FRANK
(as Esperanzas voice fades)
If we obey the court the strike will be
lost the scabs would move in as soon
as the pickets disappear If we defy the
court the pickets will be arrested and
the strike will be lost anyway

CLOSER ANGLE FEATURING FRANK

FRANK
So there it is brothers The bosses have
us coming and going I just want to say
this -- no matter which way you decide
the International will back you up -- as
its always backed you up This is a
democratic union The decisions up to
you

REVERSE ANGLE SHOOTING PAST FRANK AT MINERS

We hear a rumble of dissatisfaction as Frank sits down
There is no applause Heads huddling the miners grapple
with the dilemma Ramon rises angrily

RAMON
If we give up now if we obey this rotten
Taft-Hartley law we give up everything
its taken us fifty years to gain There
is only one answer fight them Fight
them all

OTHER MINERS
How
Theyll arrest us
We gain nothing

Their voices fade Ramon still on his feet turns on his
critics lashing them Another miner rises extending his
arms in a gesture of helplessness Over this we hear

ESPERANZAS VOICE
The men quarreled They made brave
speeches It seemed that Brother Barnes
was right -- the company had them coming
and going It seemed the strike was lost

FULL SHOT THE UNION HALL ANOTHER ANGLE

In near fg Chairman Ruiz is on his feet pounding his
gavel In bg we can see Teresa Vidal waving for
recognition The chair recognizes her Teresa has advanced
to the speakers table in fg Though obviously scared she
is not as inarticulate or halting as Consuelo had been

TERESA

Brother Chairman if you read the court
injunction carefully you will see that it
only prohibits striking miners from

picketing

(A pause)

We women are not striking miners We will
take over your picket line

We hear a stirring then a raucous male laugh

TERESA

Dont laugh We have a solution You have
none Brother Quintero was right when he
said well lose fifty years of gains if
we lose this strike Your wives and
children too But this we promise -- if
the women take your places on the picket
line the strike will not be broken and
no scabs will take your jobs

There is silence in the hall now Teresa starts to walk
back to her seat when Sals voice checks her

SAL

If thats a motion only members of
the union can make a motion

Sal glances at Charley Vidal who sits beside him Charley

hesitates

Teresa glares at her husband Charley takes a

deep breath yells

CHARLEY
I so move

(uneasy)

Youve heard the motion The floor is
open for debate

MINER

If we allow our women to help us well
be the joke of the whole labor movement

ANOTHER MINER

Look brother our women are ours our
countrywomen Why shouldnt they help us

THE HALL ANOTHER ANGLE

We see miners with their heads together in heated argument
grimaces and gestures of disapproval individual miners
rising to address the chair

ANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING LUZ MORALES
Eyes flashing she addresses the men

ESPERANZAS VOICE
And Luz asked which was worse to hide
behind a womans skirt or go down on his
knees before the boss

ANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING GONZALES

GONZALES
We havent counted enough on our women
The bosses havent counted on them at all

ANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING CHARLEY VIDAL

CHARLEY
Will the bosses win now because we have
no unity between the men and their wives
and sisters

ANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING A MINER AND HIS WIFE

A husky miner named Jos√© Sanchez can be seen goading his
wife to speak The frightened woman finally obeys

ESPERANZAS VOICE
And Carlotta Sanchez said she didnt think
picketing was proper for ladies It
wasnt nice Maybe even a sin

ANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING GONZALES AND RAMON

GONZALES
I say give the sisters a chance

Gonzales voice fades and Ramon rises glancing angrily at
Gonzales and begins to speak

RAMON
And what will happen when the cops come
and beat our women up Will we stand
there Watch them No Well take over
anyway and well be right back where we
are now Only worse Even more humiliated
Brothers I beg you -- dont allow this

Ramon sits down There is scattered applause from the men
Someone calls the question

REVERSE ANGLE SHOOTING TOWARD CHAIRMAN

SAL
(rapping his gavel)
All right The questions been called
You brothers know what youre voting on
-- that the sisters of the auxiliary take
over the picket line All those in favor
will so signify

(a bellow)
Brother Chairman A point of order

WIDER ANGLE SHOOTING TOWARD TERESA AND ESPERANZA

Teresa nudges Esperanza She rises shyly It seems that
Esperanzas stage fright will leave her mute -- but at last
she finds her voice

ESPERANZA
I dont know anything about these
questions of parliament But you men are
voting on something the women are to do
or not to do So I think its only fair
the women be allowed to vote --
especially if they have to do the job

We hear cries of approval from the womens section
intermingled with shouted objections from some men

GROUP SHOT AT CHAIRMANS TABLE

Sal has to make a ruling but he seems undecided He
glances at Charley Charley winks nods He glances at
Frank Frank grins and nods He clears his throat

SAL
Brothers and sisters It would be
unconstitutional to permit women to vote
at a union meeting
(Male applause)
If theres no objection we could adjourn
this meeting

There are cries of protest from men and women alike He
holds up his hand

SAL
No wait wait and reconvene this
meeting as a community mass meeting with
every adult entitled to a vote

VOICE
I so move

SECOND VOICE

All those in favor will raise their hands
(Most of the hands are raised)

An overwhelming majority of the women are voting for the
plan About a third of the men raise their hands -- but
some of them lower their arms when nudged angrily by their
neighbors Tellers move through the hall counting hands

hands He frowns at

BACK TO CHAIRMAN

The tellers approach Sal whisper the affirmative vote He
adds the totals then pounds his gavel

SAL
Okay All those opposed

FULL PANNING SHOT AS BEFORE

Most of the women sit with their fingers intertwined as
though in prayer A few weaker sisters raise their hands
uncertainly Their neighbors nudge then The hands come
down again CAMERA PANS to the men as the tellers count
We see a forest of raised hands Some miners are
frantically holding up both arms

BACK TO CHAIRMAN MEDIUM SHOT

The tellers give Sal their figures Sals face is grave
reveals nothing He rises announces quietly

three to eighty-five

No applause
REVERSE ANGLE FULL PANNING SHOT

A profound stillness has settled over the hall The men
turn in their places looking at their womenfolk with doubt
apprehension expectancy CAMERA PANS to the women who

line the side wall They look at each other with a
breathless wonder as the full import of their undertaking
dawns on them

FADE IN
EXT PICKET LINE LONG PANORAMIC SHOT MORNING

This panorama should be as sweeping a vista as the first
scene of the picket line We get the sense of women
streaming toward the picket post from four points of the
compass Some arrive in ancient cars others walk by way of
the road or foot paths or the railroad tracks There are

so many women on the line that even though they march two
abreast they overlap the road

ESPERANZAS VOICE
And so they came the women they rose
before dawn and they came wives
daughters grandmothers They came from
Zinc Town and the hills beyond from other
mining camps ten twenty thirty miles
away

CLOSER VIEW THE PICKET LINE

The women march in an orderly determined fashion There is
no gaiety Teresa and Mrs Salazar are in charge They are
as bold and self-assured as two drill sergeants Most of
the women are dressed for the occasion -- wearing shirts
jeans and sneakers or saddle shoes

ESPERANZAS VOICE
By sun-up there were a hundred on the
line And they kept coming--women we had
never seen before women who had nothing
to do with the strike Somehow they heard
about a womens picket line -- and they
came

MEDIUM LONG SHOT MINERS ON HILLSIDE

On the steep wooded slope above the picket post the varsity
squats on its collective haunches The men smoke watching
the picket line with mingled awe and apprehension

ESPERANZAS VOICE
And the men came too They looked unhappy
I think they were afraid Afraid the
women wouldnt stand fast -- or maybe

FADE OUT
afraid they would

THE HILLSIDE ANOTHER ANGLE HIGHER UP THE SLOPE

Several miners stand here with their families They too
look unhappy Jenkins and his wife are among them

post Some were forbidden by their
husbands

open trucks and two sheriffs cars The trucks are loaded
with men

EXT SHERIFFS CAR MEDIUM SHOT

Superintendent Alexander Chief Foreman Barton the Sheriff
and the deputy Vance are standing beside the car

Alexander is in a petulant mood but the Sheriff and Vance
seem amused by the situation Three pretty Mexican-American
girls pass by on their way to the picket line Vance
whistles at them As they move out of the scene Vance
calls

VANCE
Hey girls Wait a minute Dont you
wanta see my pistol

ALEXANDER
Shut up
(As the Sheriff chuckles)
Whats so amusing Theyre flaunting a
court order

SHERIFF
(grins)
Not so sure about that Letter of the
Law you know All the injunction says
is no picketing by miners

ALEXANDER

We hear a collective gasp from the women Then they scream
Two women run to their injured sister The others swarm
around the car The deputies are trying to get the doors
open The women begin to rock the car Finally the deputies
manage to get out They flail the women with their fists
their gun stocks But there are four women to each deputy
and they cling to the men grabbing at their weapons

The Anglo scabs standing in the back of the truck react in
fear and consternation But they stay where they are

MEDIUM LONG SHOT MINERS ON HILLSIDE

A group of them start coming down the hill We can see
Charley and Frank gesturing trying to restrain them -- but
the miners come on

BACK TO THE PICKET POST

Vance kicks out at woman who is trying to tear off his
cartridge-belt sends her sprawling He backs off
panic-stricken and fires a tear gas shell into a mass of
women pickets The exploding shell disperses them
momentarily The women fan out coughing and choking

THE PICKET POST SHOOTING FROM HILL ABOVE

At Mrs Salazars command the women form into two platoons
the larger group remains on the road blocking the convoy
despite the fact that other deputies open fire with tear
gas but another line has formed at the side of the road
facing the miners bent on entering the fray
CLOSER ANGLE THE SECOND PICKET LINE

Itll be worse if you get in it
Then theyll start shooting
Theyll throw you in jail
We can take care of ourselves
Youre not needed here
Get back Get back

The men fall back nonplussed by the vehemence of the women
BACK TO PICKET POST LONG SHOT FROM HILLSIDE

Other deputies have come running from the rear of the
convoy to support the four outnumbered deputies The scabs
remain in their trucks But the wind is blowing the wrong
way and the tear gas drifts back toward the trucks The
scabs begin to cough A couple of them jump over the
tailgate of the first truck and run That starts a panicky
rout Other scabs tumble out of the trucks and run back
down the road to escape the tear gas

wood fire is burning Teresa the picket captain walks
toward Esperanza Teresa closely watches Esperanzas
dejected face

TWO SHOT AT OIL DRUM

The two women warm their hands over the fire Theresa muses

TERESA
So they had a little taste of what its
like to be a woman and they run away
ESPERANZA
With Ramon its pride I spoke out of

the bitterness in me And he was hurt

Esperanza stares at the fire Teresa looks at her with deep
sympathy

TERESA
Anything worth learning is a hurt These
changes come with pain for other
husbands too not just Ramon

EXT MOUNTAIN LANDSCAPE LONG PANNING SHOT DAY

A vista of wild and lonely beauty A cold wind rustles the
junipers and pine of a steep boulder-strewn arroyo The
deer hunters can be seen walking up a narrow trail in
single file They are bunched together save for Ramdon who
lags behind

MEDIUM PANNING SHOT FEATURING RAMON
He walks slowly up the trail into fg brooding As he
walks he hears Esperanzas voice of the preceding night

hauntingly

ESPERANZAS VOICE
You mean youre ready to give up

(Pause)
I dont want to go down fighting I want
to win
(Pause)
Have you learned nothing from this strike
(Pause)

I can feel it coming Its like a lull
before the storm

(Pause)
And now they cant win unless they pull
off something big and pull it off fast
A shot is heard ringing through the arroyo It pulls Ramon
up short He calls to the other men suddenly

RAMON
Brothers weve got to go back

his face working in hatred and anger Esperanza is beside

slack the shadow of defeat crosses his face With an abrupt
movement he thrusts the rifle on Mrs Salazar -- who takes
it blinking with surprise

There are now over twenty women watching the eviction but

there is no excitement no talk

CLOSER ANGLE FEATURING RAMON AD ESPERANZA
Ramon is calmer now but alert planning thinking He
looks around at their gathering forces -- not yet
impressive but growing every moment He almost smiles with
slow realization

RAMON
(half to himself)
This is what weve been waiting for

ESPERANZA
(anxious puzzled)
What are you saying

RAMON
This means theyve given up trying to
break the picket line
(A pause)
Now we can all fight together -- all of
us

women loaded with objects they have just deposited in the

chasing the boys while the furniture-moving contingent is

just walked off

Did you see their faces

pause Still not looking at her Ramon says haltingly

RAMON
Esperanza thank you for your
dignity

Esperanzas eyes fill with tears

RAMON
You were right Together we can push
everything up with us as we go

ESPERANZAS VOICE

could never take away -- something I
could leave to our children -- and they
the salt of the earth would inherit it
