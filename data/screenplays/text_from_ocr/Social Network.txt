FROM TRE BLACK WE HEAR--

MARK (V0)
Did you know there are more people with
genius I1Q’s living in China than there
are people of any kind living in the
United States

BRICA (V-0)
That can’t be true

MARK (V0)
It is true

BRICA (V0)
What would account for that

MARK (V0)
Well first of all a lot of people live
in China But heres my question

FADE IN
INT CAMPUS BAR - NIGHT

MARK ZUCKERBERG is a sweet looking 19 year old whose lack of
any physically intimidating attributes masks a very
complicated and dangerous anger He has trouble making eye
contact and sometimes it’s hard to tell if he’s talking to you
or to himself

BRICA also 19 is Marks date She has a girl-next-door face
that makes her easy to fall for At this point in the
conversation she already knows that shed rather not be there
and her politeness is about to be tested

The scene is stark and simple

MARK
How do you distinguish yourself in a
population of people who all got 1600 on
their SAT’s

ERICA
I didnt know they take SATs in China

MARK
I wasn’t talking about China anymore I
was talking about here

ERICA
You got 1600

You can sing in an a Capella group

ERICA
Does that mean that you actually got
nothing wrong

MARK
Or you row crew or you invent a 25 dollar
PC

ERICA

Or you get into a final club

MARK
Or you get into a final club exactly

ERICA
I like guys who row crew

MARK
(beat)
Well I can’t do that And yes it means I
got nothing wrong on the test

ERICA
Have you ever tried

MARK
Im trying now

ERICA
To row crew

MARK
fo get into a final club To row crew
No Are you like--whatever--crazy

ERICA
Sometimes Mark-seriously--you say two
things at once and I’m not sure which one
were talking about

-MARK

But you’ve seen guys who row crew right
ERICA

No
MARK

Okay well they‘re bigger than me
Theyre world class athletes And a
second ago you said you like guys who row
crew so I assumed youd met one

ERICA
I guess I meant I liked the idea of it
The way a girl likes cowboys
MARK
The Phoenix is good

ERICA
This is a new topic

MARK
Its the same topic

ERICA
Were still talking about the finals
clubs

MARK
Would you rather talk about something
else

ERICA
No it’s just that since the beginning of
the conversation about finals clubs I
think I may have had a birthday

MARK
We can change the subject

ERICA
(cant get over it)
There are more people in China with genius
IQ’s than the entire population of--

MARK
It’s about exclusivity

ERICA
Godwhat is

MARK
The final clubs And that’s how you
distinguish yourself The Phoenix is the
most diverse The Fly Club Roosevelt
punched the Porc

ERICA
Which one

MARK
The Porcellian the Porc it’s the best
of the best

ERICA
I actually meant which Roosevelt

MARK
Theodore

ERICA
Okay well which is the easiest one to
get into

MARK takes a cigarette from a pack lights it takes a drag
and blows the smoke out before he says

MARK
im

ERICA
What

MARK
Why would you ask me that

ERICA
I was just asking

MARK
Theyre all hard to get into My friend
Eduardo made 300000 betting on oil
futures last summer and he wont get in
Money or the ability to make it doesn’t
impress anybody around here Everybody
can do that

ERICA
He made 300000 in a summer

MARK
He likes meteorology

ERICA
You said it was oil futures

MARK
T£ you can predict the weather you can
predict the price of heating oil You
asked me that because you think the final
club thats easiest to get into is the
one where Ill have the best chance

ERICA
(beat)
Ive lost my place again

MARK
you asked me which one was the easiest to
get into because you think thats where I
have the best chance

ERICA
Phe one that’s easiest to get into would
be the one where anybody had the best
chance
a

w

MARK
I just think you asked--the placement of
where you asked the question--

ERICA
I was honestly just asking Okay I was
asking just to ask Mark I’m not
speaking in code

MARK
Erica--

a ERICA
Youre obsessed with the finals clubs
you have finals clubs OCD and you need to
see someone about this who’ll prescribe
some sort of medication You dont care
if gide effects may include blindness
okay just do it

MARK
Final clube Not finals clubs and there’s
a difference between being obsessed and
baing motivated

ERICA
Yes there is

MARK
Well you do--that was cryptic-so you do
speak in code

ERICA
I didn’t mean to be cryptic

MARK
Im saying — need to do something
substantial in order to get the attention
of the clubs

ERICA
Why

MARK
Because theyre exclusive
(beat)
And fun and they lead to a better life 1

BRICA
You think Teddy Roosevelt got elected
president because he was a member of the
Phoenix Club

MARK
He was a member of the Porcellian and yes
I do
ERICA
Maybe he sang in an a Capella group

MARK
I want to be straight forward and tell
you that I think you should be a lot more
supportive If I get in I‘1l be taking
you to the parties and youll be meeting
people that you wouldn’t normally get to
meet

ERICA
(smiles)
You would do that for me

MARK
youre my girlfriend

ERICA
Okay well I want to be straight forward
and tell you that I’m not anymore

MARK
beat)
What do you mean

ERICA
Im not your girlfriend anymore

MARK
Is this a joke

ERICA
No I’m sorry it’s not

MARK
Youre breaking up with me

ERICA
You’xe going to introduce me to people I
wouldnt normally get to meet What the
fuck is that supposed to mean

MARK
Take it easy

ERICA
What was it supposed to mean

MARK
It was--Erica the reason we’re able to
sit here and drink is that you used to
sleep with the door guy

ERICA
(pause)
I want to really try not to lose it now
(MORE)

ERICA (CONTD)
the door guys name is Bobby I havent

slept with the door guy the door guy’s a

friend of mine Hes a perfectly good
class of people and what part of Long
Island are you from--England

MARK

Im from Westchester
ERICA

Im going back to my dorm

MARE

ERICA

Yes
MARK

I apologize okay Siddown

ERICA

study

MARK
Erica
ERICA

MARK
Im sorry and I mean it
ERICA
I appreciate that but-
MARK
Come on
ERICA
--I have to study
MARK
You don’t have to study Let’s just talk
ERICA
f can’t
MARK
Why
ERICA

Because it’s exhausting Going out with
you is like dating a stairmaster

i
MARK
All I meant is that you go to BU and so
youre not likely to-1 wasn’t making a
comment on your parents--I was saying you
go to BU

ERICA
I have to go study-
MARK
You dont have to study

ERICA
How do you know I don‘t have to study

MARK
Because you go to BU

ERICA stares at him

MARK (CONTD)
(beat)
Do you want to get some food

ERICA
tim sorry youre not sufficiently
impressed with my education

MARK
And Im sorry I dont have a rowboat

ERICA
Tt think we should just be friends

MARK
t don’t need friends

ERICA
twas being polite I had no intention of
peing friends with you

MARK
You’re really leaving

HBRICA takes MARK‘’s hand and looks at him tenderly

ERICA

(close)
Listen Youre going to be successful and
rich But youre going to go through life
thinking that girls don’t like you
because you’re a tech geek And I want
you to know from the bottom of my heart
that that won’t be true It’11 be because
youre an asshole
And with that stinger ERICA walks off and we stay on MARK as
the pulsing intro to Paul Youngs “Love of the Common People”
erashes in-

ERICA (CONTD)
(calling over her shoulder)
And you’re never getting into a final
club

Along with the MUSIC we slowly push in on MARK A fuse has
just been iit

As MARK busts out of the bar past Bobby the door guy and into
the population of Harvard Square

EXT HARVARD SQUARE - NIGHT

As MARK continues on he passes a group of people heading in
the opposite direction for a party

As MARK’s steady and determined stride continues hell pass
by all kinds of (seemingly) happy well-adjusted socially
adept people

the vocals from the Paul Young song come in--

PAUL YOUNG
LIVING ON FREE FOOD TICKETS
WATER IN THE MILK FROM A HOLE IN THE ROOF

INT MARK’S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

A bedroom that‘s part of a three-bedroom suite The MUSIC
CONTINUES as MARK walks in flicks his lap-top on without
looking at it and walks out of frame as we stay on the laptop

PAUL YOUNG
‘CAUSE SHES LIVING IN THE LOVE OF THE
COMMON PEOPLE
SMILES FROM THE HEART OF A FAMILY MAN

MAMAS GONNA LOVE YOU JUST AS MUCH AS SHE
CAN
AND SHE CAN

Then a moment or two later a glass with ice gets set down
next to the lap-top Then a carton of orange juice followed by
a bottle of vodka

MARKs fingers dance easily on the keyboard--like a Juilliard
pianist warming up

In the exact time it takes him to pour the vodka and orange
juice over ice the website he’s just called up gets loaded
onto the screen

Zuckonitcom
This is the only place he’s comfortable
TITLE
813 PM
He begins blogging

MARK (V0-)
Erica Albright‘s a bitch You think
that’s because her family changed their
name from Albrecht or do you think it’s
because 411 BU girls are bitches

He takes a good gulp of his drink We see the words were
hearing filling up his computer screen--

MARK (V0) (CONTD)

Folks for the record she may look like
a 34D but she’s getting all kinds of help
from our friends at Victorias Secret
She’s a 34B as in barely anything there
False advertising

In back of MARK sitting on the bed and hitting a bong is

BILLY OLSEN No
MARK (V0)

The truth is she has a nice face I need
to think of something to help me take my
mind off her Easy enough except I need
an idea

MARK has moved his mouse to an jicon on his desktop labeled
Kirkland Facebook” He clicks and opens it A menu of photos
appear He blogs again

MARK (VO) (CONTD)
I’m a little intoxicated I’m not gonna
lie So what if it’s not even 10PM and
it’s a Tuesday night The Kirkland
facebook is open on my desktop and some
of these people have pretty horrendous
facebook pics Billy Olson’s sitting here
and had the idea of putting some of these
gitls’ faces next to pictures of farm
anjmals and have people vote on whos
hotter

INT FINAL CLUB - NIGHT

Well be cutting back here a lot in this sequence with the
Paul Young song tying them together as we show---mostly MOS--—
preparations under way for the hottest party on campus
tonaght

We start on a good looking STUDENT fixing his tie in the
bathroom mirror Re walks out of the bathroom and into the
main area where he’s immediately tossed a bottle of champagne
by a similarly dressed STUDENT We see that there are a
couple of dozen other guys around Our guy takes the champagne
bottle and sticks it on the bar which is being stocked by two
sexy FEMALE uniformed BARTENDERS

Our guy walks past a DJs table where the DJ is setting up his
incredibly high-end equipment

Our guy trots down a set of mahogany and red-carpet stairs
opens a heavy door and looks out to the sidewalk

A BOUNCER in a tuxedo is standing by a velvet rope which is
holding back three dozen STUDENTS The students are mostly
women and the women are all dressed to catch a man

over all this we HEAR MARK CONTINUING--

MARK (V0)
Good call Mr Olson I think he’s on to
something

VITLE
1017 PM

MARK (V0) (CONT’D)

Yea its on I’m not gonna do the farm
animals but I like the idea of comparing
two people together It gives the whole
thing a very Turing feel since people’s
ratings of the pictures will be more
implicit than say choosing a number to
represent each person’s hotness like they
do on hotornetcom The first thing were

oing to need is a lot of pictures
tnfortunately Harvard doesnt keep a
public centralized facebook so I’m going
to have to get all the images from the
individual houses that people are in Let
the hacking begin

There are two more kids in the room with MARK-DUSTIN
MOSKOWITZ and CHRIS HUGHES

overything open and allow indexes in
their Apache configuration so a little
WGET magic is all that’s necessary to

Its three years later and MARK is sitting with his LAWYERS at

a large conference table

MARK is wearing a hoodie sweatpants and Adidas flip-flops-a
personal uniform that we’ll come to understand And while it
may take us a while to notice it MARK’s a aifferent person in
these flash-forward scenes Still tortured and complicated
but comfortable now with his own power

His lawyer is SY whos accompanied by some junior associates
one of whom--a pleasant pretty and professional young
contemporary of Mark’s named MARYLIN we’ll get to know

On the other side are EDUARDO and his lawyer GRETCHEN also
accompanied by some associates A STENOGRAPHER is typing the

YEecor ass

The room is glass on two sides and through the windows we can
see the behemoths of Silicon Valley--Oracle SunMicrosystems
Google etc

GRETCHEN is talking MARKs deposition

GRETCHEN
So you were called in front of the Ad
Board

MARK

That’s not what happened

GRETCHEN
You werent called in front of the
Administrative Board

MARK

No back I mean--That’s--back at the bar
with Erica Albright She said all that
That I said that stuff to her

GRETCHEN
I was reading from the transcript of her
deposition so--

Why would you even need to depose her

somebody’s lied under cath

The fourth boat is being crewed by CAMERON and TYLER
WINKLEVOSS---identical twins who stepped out of an ad for
Abercrombie and Fitch

They know that the others arent in their class and even
though theyre highly competitive athletes they dont like
showing anyone up least of all their teammates

CAMERON
Is there anyway to make this a fair
fight

We could jump out and swim

CAMERON
I-think we’d have to jump out and drown

TYLER
I’m not willing to do that

CAMERON
What are we at three-quarter power Let’s
drop down to a half

backward

violation of the university’s policy on

the Crimson to the ABHW to Fuerza Latina
and to any women at Harvard who might
have been insulted as I take it they were
by the things that have been said to me
in the last week As for any charges
stemming from the breach of security I

MARK is in his Operating Systems class This is considered the
hardest class at Harvard and MARK is one of the 50 students
with their laptops open as the professor takes them through an

impossibly difficult lesson

PROFESSOR
So let’s look at a sample problem
Suppose were given a computer with a 16-
bit virtual address and a page size of
256 bytes

A GIRL scribbles something on a piece of paper Then hands it
to the student next to her and nods that it should be passed
over to MARK While that’s happening-—

PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
The system uses one-level page tables
which start at address 0x0400 Maybe you
want to have DMA on your 16-bit system
who knows The first few pages are
reserved for hardware flags etc

MARK opens the note It reads “Asshole”

He looks over and sees a couple of GIRLS looking at him with
contempt

“PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
Assume page table entries have eight
status bits —

MARK closes his laptop gets up and starts to head out of the
hall

PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
The eight status bits would be-

We find a table in the back where DIVYA is sitting with some
of his friends who are having a nice time DIVYA’s got his
Laptop open

Let me tell you why I’m asking I’m
wondering why if you needed a thousand
dollars to start up your project you
didnt ask my clients for it Theyd
demonstrated to you an interest in this
kind of thing so-

MARK
From that youre deducing that I didn’t
go to them because I didnt want them to
know what I was working on I went to my
best friend for the money because hes
who I wanted to be partners with because
of our similar vision and his superior
business skills Eduardo was president of

There’s a lower-level and a baleony and both are full

balcony

Well hear the SPEAKER but we’ll only get to see him in a

slightly blurry image as our attention is on MARK and EDUARDO

SPEAKER
And it was a clear day And I was up in
my Radcliffe dorm And he brought that up
there and said “Look it’s going to
happen without us We’ve got to do it
now” And so ET saidOkay”

He gets an appreciative LAUGH from the STUDENTS

SPEBRER (CONT’D
Wow the starting ‘of this industry was
very humble indeed The kit computer on
the cover of that magazine--

We HEAR a little muffled giggling coming from the row behind

MARK and EDUARDO MARK is too into the speech to notice but

ghe giggling registers as a slight annoyance on EDUARDO‘s
ace

SPEAKER (CONTD)
--had an 8080 processor in it and you
had to assemble it yourself and it came
with 256K of memory
EDUARDO hears the giggling again and turns around

In the row behind them and a few seats over are two beautiful

Asian students-ALICE and JENNY Theyre a little overly made-

up for a lecture JENNY the one sitting closest to EDUARDO
is wearing a short skirt with a white shirt open one button
too far down the front and we can see a hint of the red bra
she’s wearing underneath

She leans forward and whispers to EDUARDO--

CAMERON and TYLER in dark suits are waiting to see the
president of Harvard

The President’s office is in one of the two oldest university
buildings in the country and the SECRETARY sitting at the

desk Tereven older You get the sense that she thinks Harvard
would be a ser place if it werent for alJ these students

She looks at them and the boys give her a polite smile and a
small nod before she goes back to her work

CAMERON
(just making small talk)
Ive never been in this building

SECRETARY
(without really lcoking up)
This building is a hundred years older
than the country it’s in

CAMERON
(thats interesting)
Hm
SECRETARY
So do be careful
TYLER
Were just sitting in the chairs
SECRETARY
(into phone)
Yes

Very good

She hangs up the phone

SECRETARY (CONTD)

She points to a door and CAMERON and TYLER get up quickly
straighten themselves and walk into

INT SUMMERS’ OFFICE CONTINUOUS

LARRY SUMMERS a large man is on the phone at his desk in his
well-appointed office A fire crackles in the sitting area and
a 40-ish African-American woman ANNE in a pants suit is
nearby going ever some papers

SUMMERS waves the boys in--

SUMMERS

(into phone
That’s just their own stupidity I should
have been there

(into phone)
Darkness is the absence of light and
stupidity in that instance was the
absence of me

SUMMERS motions for them to sit and they do They take in some
of the photographs around the room--SUMMERS with BILL CLINTON
etc

‘SUMMERS (CONTD)

SUMMERS hangs up the phone

SUMMERS (CONTD)
Good morning

CAMERON
Good morning sir I‘m Cameron Winklevoss
and this is my brother Tyler

CAMERON is extending his hand but instead of taking it
SUMMERS reaches to the top of a pile of papers and pulls a ten-
page letter off the top

SUMMERS
Why are you here

There’s silence while SUMMERS appears to read over the
letter

SUMMERS (CONT‘D)
That wasn’t rhetorical

CAMERON
I’m sorry I thought you were reading the
letter

SUMMERS

I‘ve read the letter

CAMERON
Well I think it’s pretty self-
explanatory We had an idea for a website
called HarvardCconnection--weve since
changed the name to ConnectU--and Mark
Zackerberg stole that idea and--

SUMMERS
What do you want me to do about it

CAMERON points to a row of Harvard Student Handbooks on the

bookshelf behind

CAMERON
Well sir in The Harvard Student
Handbook which is distributed to each
freshman--under the heading Standards of
Conduct in the Harvard Community” and the
sub-heading “Honesty”--

SUMMERS
Oh dear God

CAMERON
--it says The College expects that all
students will be honest and forthcoming
in their dealings with members of this
community All students are required to
respect private and public ownership
Instances of theft misappropriation or
unauthorized use of or damage to property
or materials--

SUMMERS
Excuse me Anne
ANNE
Yes sir
SUMMERS

Punch me in the face
(beat--then to CAMERON)
Go ahead

CAMERON
(beat)
--will result in disciplinary action
ineluding the requirement to withdraw
from the College” Thats what is says in
the handbook

SUMMERS
When did you memorize that

TYLER
(a little frustrated with this
bullshit)

(MORE

TYLER (CONTD)
Sir it’s against University rules to
steal £rom another student Plain and
simple

SUMMERS
Youve spoken to your RA

CAMERON
yes sir and the RA made a
recommendation to the Ad Board but the Ad
Board wont hear us

SUMMERS
Have you tried dealing with Mr
Zuckerberg directly

CAMERON
Mr Zuckerberg hasnt responded to any of
our e-mails or phone calls for the last’
two weeks He doesnt answer when we
knock on his door at Kirkland and the
closest weve come to talking face to
face is when I saw him on the quad and
chased him through Harvard Square

SUMMERS
You chased him

CAMERON
(beat)
I saw him and I know he saw me and I
started after him and he disappeared

SUMMERS
You know he could have you arrested for
harassment and attempted assault

TYLER

(quietly)
This isn’t happening

SUMMERS
I don’t see this as a University issue

TYLER
Of course its a University issue
Theres a code of ethics and an honor
code and he violated them both

SUMMERS
You entered into a code of ethics with
the university not with each other

TYLER
(beat)
I‘m sorry President Summers what you
just said makes no sense to me at all

94

SUMMERS
I’m devastated by that

CAMBRON
What my brother means is that if Mark
Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room and
stole our computer it would be a
university issue right

SUMMERS
T redliy dont know This office doesn’t
handle petty larceny and the only reason

I agreed to see you--Annepwhy did I
agree to see them

ANNE co
Colleagues of their father

SUMMERS
So you see
TYLER
This isn’t a petty larceny
CAMERON
(calming)
Ty--
TYLER

This idea is potentially worth millions
of dollars

SUMMERS
Millions of dollars

CAMERON
Yes

SUMMERS

You might be letting your imagination run
away with you

TYLER
With all due respect I dont think youre
in any position to make that call

SUMMERS
I was US Treasury Secretary I’m in
some position to make that call

TYLER
Letting our imaginations run away with nus
is exactly what we were told to do in
your freshmen address
SUMMERS
Well I would try letting your
imaginations run away with you on a new
project

TYLER
You would

SUMMERS

Everyone at Harvard is inventing
something or starting a new business in
their dorm room Harvard undergraduates
believe that inventing a job is better
than getting one so can I suggest again
that the two of you come up with a new
new project

CAMERON
Im sorry but that’s not the point sir

SUMMERS
Whats the point

CAMERON
You don’t have to be an intellectual
property expert to understand the
difference between right and wrong

SUMMERS
And youre saying that I dont

CAMERON
Of course Im not saying that

TYLER
Im saying that

SUMMERS looks at TYLER and then smiles

TYLER (CONTD)
Just start another project Like were
making a diorama for the science fair

SUMMERS
Yes And if you have a goddam problem
with that Mr Winklevoss the courts are
always at your disposal Athletes dont
get special treatment at this school

TYLER
Do they get fairness

SUMMERS
They don’t get to run to daddy Okay
This isn’t 50 years ago

Excuse me sir but in your analogy is

The dining hall was serving chicken for
dinner and I had to feed my chicken so I
justI cut up little pieces of chicken
and gave it to the chicken’ There were a
lot of people there and someone must have
seen me and the next thing I knew I was
being accused of forced cannibalism

tipped off by somebody else who was
there

MARK
Alright lets just forget about it

EDUARDO
I can’t forget abont it I’m being
accused of animal cruelty It’s better to
be accused of armed robbery I’m going to
have to explain this to my father I’m
going to have to explain this to
everyone I’m going to have to--what is
happening on that

EDUARDO‘s referring to a laptop that’s open and displaying
images of four paintings

GRETCHEN
Mr Zuckerberg was cheating on his final
exam

EDUARDO

CUT TO

INT COMPUTER SCIENCE BUTLDINGBASHMENT CORRIDOR - NIGHT
EDUARDO steps through double doors and stops for a moment as
he HRARS an odd sound--RAUCOUS CHEERING from a CROWD that’s

gathered in one of the classrooms

EDUARDO walks down to the classroom opens the door and walks
into--

INT CLASSROOM -— NIGHT

--where 60 or so STUDENTS are in a semi-circle five and six
deep cheering on the contestants for the internship

All the desks in the room have been moved to the sides and
five desks with laptops set up in the middle Wext to each
laptop is a shot glass filled with Jack Daniels
113

DUSTIN’s holding a watch and MARK is walking slowly back and
forth behind the five “interviewees” who are intensely typing
at their keyboards

EDUARDO slowly makes his way through the crowd to MARK He can
see that on the computer screens are a whole lot of numbers
and letters that neither he nor we can understand

He stands next to MARK and watches this for a moment Every
once in a while one of the contestants will throw back their
shot of Jack Daniels which will instantly get re-filled by a
PRETTY ASIAN GIRL Throughout all this the CHEERING CONTINUES

EDUARDO
(pause)
Mark
MARK
Yeah
EDUARDO

What’s goin’ on

MARK
They have 10 minutes to get root access
to a Python webserver expose its SSL
encryption and then intercept all traffic
over its secure port

EDUARDO
Theyre hacking

MARK
All behind a Pix Firewall Emulator But
here’s the beauty

EDUARDO
You know I didn’t understand what you
just said right

MARK
I do know that

EDUARDO
Whats the beauty

MARK
Bvery 10th line of code written they
have to drink a shot And hacking’s
supposed to be stealth so anytime the
server detects an intrusion the
candidate responsible has to drink a
shot I also have a program running that
has a pop-up window appear simultaneously
on ali five computers--the last candidate
to hit the window has to drink a shot
Plus every three minutes they all have to
drink a shot

DUSTIN
(calling out)
Three minutes

All five candidates drain their shot glasses and slamthem
down where they get refilled by the pretty Asian girl

EDUARDO
Gan I ask--what part of the interns’ jobs
will they need to be able to do drunk

MARK
youre right A more relevant test would
be seeing if they can keep a chicken
alive for a week

(pause)

What T just said was mean and Im sorry
(beat)

Are we alright We started this as a

team
EDUARDO hands MARK a thick envelope-
EDUARDO

What‘s this
EDUARDO
I opened a new account and put 18000 in
it Will that get you through the summer
MARK looks at EDUARDO --

Suddenly two of the candidates hands shoot up almost at the
same time--

MARK glances over at the first screen then the second

MARK

as LOUD MUSIC plays A zip ‘line is tied from the chimney and
runs down over a small swimming pool where its attached to a
telephone pole on the other side

MARK grabs onto the handle that’s connected to the zip line
and flies out over the pool jumping in with a splash and
cheers from DUSTIN and the INTERNS who are waiting their turns
on the roof

DUSTIN pulls the handle back up with a rope that’s been
rigged grabs the handle takes off and jumps into the poolto
similar cheers

The handle gets pulled back on a rope an INTERN grabs it
jumps—

eontorting

A WAITRESS holding a tray of colored drinks high over her head
takes us through the crowd to a spiral staircase thats being
guarded by two more BOUNCERS with clipboards Tae staircase
leads up to the 2nd level which is all VIP tables that look

couches and a table covered in bottles of vodka tequila rum

EXT THE THAMES DAY

Were looking at a stone bridge crossing a perfectly straight
stretch of water against the backdrop of the medieval town of
Henley England--founded in 1179

And after a moment of placid quiet-—-
-BOOSH

Two razor thin skulls explode out from under the bridge for
the final agonizing hundred-meter stretch of the ancient and
prestigious Henley Royal Regatta

The two boats are neck and neck coming out of the bridge The
port-side boat is being crewed by the two Dutch members of the
Hollandia Roeiclub The starboard boat is being crewed by a
paix of identical twins wearing tank tops bearing the H” of
Harvard

We HEAR the ROAR come up from the CROWD in the viewing
section The crowd is dressed as if for opening day at Ascot—-
the women in flowing dresses and wide-brimmed hats the men in
blazers and brightly colored floral ties

But the young men in the boats can barely hear the crowd Just
their own breathing as they pull against the longest natural
straight stretch of water in the world--a mile and a half
torture test against the best competition theyve ever faced

And theyre neck and neck CAMERON and TYLER cant shake the
Dutch

The CROWD is going crazy in their own English way as none of
them can remember ever seeing two boats this close this late
Mixed in with the British crowd is a small contingent waving
the flag of Holland and a slightly larger contingent of
Americans

H
i

i
i
i

Well notice a stoic man in a VIP viewing section and later
well be introduced to him as Cameron and Tylers father Next

to him is their mother who can barely watch

Back on the boats it’s just the breathing as the skulls slice
through the water like jet-powered knives 50 meters now and
theres still no daylight between them

We see a small trickle of blood from CAMBRON’s left hand begin
to stream down his arm

25 meters and the Dutch and American fans are going crazy--

even the British aristocracy can’t help but get caught Op

the closest race in the history of the competition The FAT
is sllently willing his boys one more fraction of boat speed——
the MOTHER has her hands over her mouth in praying position

The blood that’s covering CAMERONs left arm is being diluted
by the sweat thats pouring down from his triceps as they dig
and pull and pull and pull and--

POP

--the finish gun is fired into the air the oars come out of
the water and the bodies of the crewmen slump over

CAMERON turns his head to the cheering crowd to see the Dutch
group holding a giant flag and jwnping up and down The
Americans bring their giant flag down and fold it up

The two DUTCH CREW MEMBERS pump their fists in the air and hug
as the two boats skim along to a gentle stop

The MOTHER drops her head and looks down The FATHER refuses
to look away

From CAMERON and TYLER just the breathing
CULT TO cS
EXT AWARD CEREMONY - DAY

CAMERON and TYLER are standing with their coaches and next to
the two DUTCH CREWMEN who are with their coaches Theyre on a
stand in the Stewards Enclosure a sprawling and glamorous
tented area for the exclusive use of members and their guests

After a moment a man in a double breasted navy blazer steps
out with his retinue in tow The man is PRINCE ALBERT of
Monaco He receives a healthy clapping of golf applause as he
approaches the stand

This conversation is done without microphones or anything as
modern as that

AIDE

CAMERON is thinking about starting a war with Monaco right now
so he lets his brother do the talking

TYLER
(beat)
No Your Highness Mile and a half races
are moré commonly won by a boat length or
two

PRINCE ALBERT -
Yes that’s absolutely right Less than a
second though in your case Well as they
say I suppose it just came down to who
wanted it more

CAMERON

Oh what a bullshit cliche you think we
