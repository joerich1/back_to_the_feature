TEASER

EXT HILLSIDE - NIGHT

A gentle slope The city shimmers like a postcard below
Peaceful Calm SILENT Perfect Then-

SCREECHING TIRES Suddenly a CAR COMES CRASHING THROUGH THE
FRAME a flipping blur of flying metal and BREAKING GLASS

And then it’s gone Everything’s still just as we found it

DR LEE (VO)
So tell me how it works

ANGLE ON the wrecked car CLOSE ON the eyes of MARK BRITTEN
unconscious hanging upside down by his seatbelt We can hear
the WHEELS STILL SPINNING helplessly in the air

BRITTEN (VO)
I don’t know I close my eyes I
open them Just like you

Very slowly pull back from his eyes until we see other
passengers in the car

HIS WIFE (HANNAH BRITTEN) and a TEENAGE SON (REX BRITTEN) -—
more on them in a moment They’re also hanging from their
seatbelts bloody and unconscious

DR LEE (VO)
Let’s just start at the beginning

Suddenly Britten’s eyes flutter open He looks around As he
takes in his wife and son hanging from their belts-

SMASH TO

INT DR LEE’S OFFICE

CLOSE ON Det Mark Britten 40ish handsome healed but a
weight to his stare He’d rather not remember the beginning

BRITTEN
No Let’s start at right now

REVEAL DR LEE late 30’s Asian-American a cerebral
presence in a muted calming vaguely Zen environment

He makes a note in his book then looks back at Britten

DR LEE
Very well You’re back to work

BRITTEN
Yes
EXT LOWEN’S RESTAURANTBAR - NIGHT

Britten suit and tie steps through barricades holding back
a crowd

As he does DET RICHARD VEGA 30’s gregarious the type of
person who talks to strangers in elevators steps over

He’s the only one who seems excited to be at a murder scene

VEGA
Detective Britten Over here

DR LEE (VO)
And they’ ve got you working with a
partner

BRITTEN (VO)
New guy Vega They just want
someone to hold my hand until they
know I’m okay

INT DR LEE’S OFFICE
Lee leans on his fingers and looks at him

DR LEE
And are you okay

BRITTEN
(long beat)
Yes

EXT LOWEN’S RESTAURANTBAR - NIGHT

There’s a cab with a shattered window a DEAD DRIVER slumped
behind the wheel

Vega walks Britten through the scene like a tour guide with a
slight case of nerves He refers heavily to his notes

VEGA
So the driver picked up a fare
downtown registered this address
with dispatch Um he’s still got
his wallet and theres a twenty on
the seat beside him so I think not
only was it not a robbery it looks
like the fare was actually paid
Then either the rider or someone
else puts a gun to the window
BOOM BOOM BOOM leaves us this
messy little mystery

BRITTEN
Witnesses

Vega nods proudly He’s on that He motions to an OFFICER who
brings over a WITNESS knit cap 30s skinny very polite
VEGA
Okay so I’ve interviewed about
thirt Basically everybody came
out of the bar when it Ynappened
Butthis guy lives in the apartment
building above it saw from his
window

WITNESS
After I heard the shots I looked
out saw a man in a cowboy hat run
that way up the block and then
turn into that alley

Thanks I’ iL Pot you know if I have
other questions

The Officer leads the witness away As he goes-

WITNESS
Happy to help

Vega turns to Britten

VEGA
Exact same report from the bar
witnesses just a little more chaos
on the ground Guy in a cowboy hat
running away but no one close and
no one who claims to have seen the
shooting

BRITTEN
What do we know about the driver

Back to his notes

VEGA
Right Driver Married No kids
Dispatcher says he wasn’t the type
to get in an argument At this
point nothing really suggests he
should be dead except for the fact
that he is

Britten surveys the scene Looks past the crowds at the
barricades and notices the building across the street

BRITTEN
Building looks like it’s gota
secured front door Let’s see if
they’ve got a camera on it Might
have caught something we can use

Vega smiles stares at him a beat

BRITTEN (CONTD)
What

VEGA
I just um want to thank you
BRITTEN
For what

VEGA
I got passed over for detective
three times before this assignment
I’m pretty sure I only got the
boost because you requested me I
just wanted you to know I uh I
won’t disappoint you

Britten’s starts away

BRITTEN
I didn’t request anyone If you got
promoted it’s because they didn’
want to waste anyone else’s time”
baby-sitting me

As Vega takes that in-

DR LEE (VO)
And then what

BRITTEN (VO)
I go home

INT BRITTEN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

It’s a modest but homey craftsman bungalow that looks a
million miles from murder investigations

As Britten steps in his wife HANNAH the woman from the
wreck late 30s stunning warm looks down from a ladder
where she’s repainting a wall She smiles

HANNAH
Perfect Just in time to help me
clean up
He looks at the dropcloth brushes paint
BRITTEN

Maybe it’s time to just embrace the
mess

INT DR LEE’S OFFICE
Lee is making notes
DR L
Did she start redoing the house
after the accident

BRITTEN
After the funeral
DR LEE
(nodding)
That’s a common reaction We all
look for ways to start fresh Has
she gotten to your son’s room

INT BRITTEN’S HOUSE - REX’S ROOM

Britten opens the room Typical teenage chaos with an odd
sense of being frozen in amber He stares at it

BRITTEN (Vv oO
No I’m not sure she’s even been in
it yet
INT BRITTEN’S HOUSE - MARK’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Britten crawls into bed next to Hannah who’s asleep He
gives her a kiss on the cheek lays back closes his eyes

CLOSE ON HIS EYES as we hear DR STEPHANIE EVANS

DR EVANS (VO)
And then

CUT TO

INT BRITTEN’S HOUSE - MARK’S BEDROOM —- MORNING
Britten opens his eyes

BRITTEN (VO)
I wake up

He looks beside him His wife isn’t there He looks down at
his wrist There’s a GREEN rubber band around it

DR EVANS (VO)
What’s the purpose of the rubber
bands

BRITTEN (VO)

Sometimes it gets confusing They
just help me keep things straight

INT BRITTEN’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - MORNING

Britten pulls on his coat as he steps into the hall

Then just as he passes his SON’S DOOR IT SUDDENLY OPENS and
into the hall comes REX BRITTEN the other passenger from the
wreck 15 tall good looking and only moderately awake

Britten doesn’t seem at all surprised to see him
BRITTEN
Morning

Rex simply emits a half awake GRUMBLE

INT BRITTEN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

Britten and Rex eat cereal watch Sportscenter Not a lot of
chatter but Britten seems unsure how to change that

A car outside HONKS Rex jumps up grabs a large TENNIS BAG
stuffs in an extra racquet
REX
That’s Aaron I gotta go

BRITTEN
What about the uh the match

Rex stops

REX
What about it

BRITTEN
Do you want me there

Rex shrugs

REX
Whatever you think
He starts out

BRITTEN
Wait

Britten stands walks over hugs the boy Rex more endures
than reciprocates Britten doesn’t care He just holds on

INT DR EVANS’ OFFICE - DAY

REVEAL DR STEPHANIE EVANS late 20’s attractive with all
the eagerness of someone new enough to her job to still love
it Her office is modern but not stark

She takes no notes Instead she tends to smile and tilt her
head as she listens as if every answer is right

DR EVANS
And you said the tennis is new

BRITTEN
Sort of His mom was very good
Played in college She taught him
He used to play until he discovered
football
DR EVANS
But he’s decided to take it up
again Since the funeral

Britten nods

DR EVANS (CONTD)
smiling
Great What else

INT BAKER HOUSE - MORNING

Britten steps into a MURDER SCENE Two bodies TOM and IRENE
BAKER are laid out stabbed blood everywhere

Vega walks toward Britten but then simply nods curtly and
WALKS BY AS IF THEY BARELY KNOW EACH OTHER

Instead we hear the voice of DET ISAIAH FREEMAN (‘BIRD’)

BIRD (0C)
You see this coffee maker

Britten turns to see BIRD African-American 50’s salt and
pepper hair and an air of having seen it all twice He
indicates a complicated coffee maker on the counter

BIRD (CONTD)

My ex always wanted one of these
Told her she wanted a six hundred
dollar coffee maker she should not
have married a police

(beat)
We eventually agreed on that

(re the scene)
Tell me what you see I’1l tell you
what you miss

Britten surveys the mess

BRITTEN
Husband and wife victims

Bird is playing with the coffee machine but nods
BRITTEN (CONT’D)
Multiple stab wounds Some signs
that they put up a fight

BIRD
Also some signs that they lost

BRITTEN
No wallet or purse

Gone along with one of the cars
BMW
BRITTEN
So what just a home invasion that
turned messy

Bird stares at the coffee maker

BIRD
Why I’ve avoided success at all
costs Work your whole life to get
some nice stuff just so someone can
kill you for it

Britten looks around notices pictures on the walls Many
show a YOUNG GIRL with the couple Bird picks up on this

BIRD (CONTD)
No sign of the little girl
Checking with friends family
hoping someone tells us she wasn’t
ome

INT BAKER HOUSE - GIRL’S BEDROOM

Britten walks into a nexus of Twilight posters and the color
pink Begins to poke around Bird waits in the doorway

Britten opens the closet stops

BRITTEN
You smell that

BIRD
I’ve been nursing a cold since the
Carter administration

Britten leans into the closet kneels pokes his head into
the corner SNIFFS When he comes out-

BRITTEN
Girl was here when it happened

BIRD
How do you know

BRITTEN
Because she hid in the closet and
pissed her pants Either she ran
when the killer left or he-

BIRD
What I get for hoping

Bird turns shouts to the officers in the other room-—

BIRD (CONTD)
Boys New deal

As Bird starts to give orders Britten looks back at the
closet OFF his expression -
DR EVANS (VO)
And this has been happening since
the accident

INT DR EVANS’ OFFICE

Britten looks at her

BRITTEN
Yes

DR EVANS
Fascinating

(reigning it in)
Not to be insensitive its just
our brain’s main function is to
protect us Sometimes that means
sensing danger or feeling pain And
sometimes it actually means
deceiving ourselves

(to explain)
The 8s of a loved one is one of
the most emotionally crippling
things we face We come up with all
sorts of ways to get through it
Like your son taking up his
mother’s sport to maintain some
sense of connection with her But
your brain it’s created an
entire reality where you haven’t
actually lost your wife at all

INT DR LEE’S OFFICE
Dr Lee is in the middle of a similar thought

DR LEE
An elaborate and ongoing dream in
which you haven’t lost your son
relieving you of the ob igation of
dealing with his death I’m not
sure I’ve ever seen a coping
mechanism quite like it

Britten looks at him A beat

BRITTEN
How do you know it’s a dream

DR LEE
I’m sorry

BRITTEN
How do you know that the world
where my wife died and my son lived
is my dream Maybe that’s reality
and this world where my wife lived
and my son died is the dream
INT DR EVANS’ OFFICE
Dr Evans looks genuinely surprised

DR EVANS
Wait You mean you can’t tell them
apart

Britten shakes his head She’s practically giddy

DR EVANS (CONT’D)
Incredible

INT DR LEE’S OFFICE
Lee looks incredulous
DR LEE
oye re saying you’re not
Son

ident whether you’re asleep or
awake at this very moment

Britten looks at the rubber band on his arm It’s BLUE

BRITTEN

Everything feels just as real in
one world as it does in the other
I never look down and discover I’m
naked or late for a test Never
suddenly start to fly Whether I’m
with my wife or my son everything
is completely normal Then I close
my eyes open them and the other
one is waiting

A long beat Dr Lee makes a note
DR LEE
Well I can assure you Detective
Britten this is not a dream
Britten can’t help but smile

DR LEE (CONT’D)
What

BRITTEN
That’s exactly what the other
psychiatrist said

END OF TEASER

ACT ONE

INT POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

Britten and Vega arescanning through the security camera
footage As a cab rolls into frame-

BRITTEN
Whoa Right there

They let it play

VEGA
Could hardly ask for a better
angle

A SKINNY MAN IN A COWBOY HAT opens the rear door hands a
twenty to the driver then gets out

He takes a step and then turns and FIRES THREE SHOTS through
the window ling the driver

Then he looks DIRECTLY AT THE CAMERA and TIPS HIS HAT before
running away Vega and Britten look at each other surprised

VEGA (CONT’D)
Wow Part murder part performance
piece

Britten rewinds watches the shooting again then the polite
hat tip The killer’s hat is low his sunglasses large

BRITTEN

Disguise doesn’t give us a lot to
go on Let’s pull a still and put
it out to all the local-

Suddenly an OFFICER anxiously sticks his head in

OFFICER
Detectives We’ve got another one

BRITTEN
Another what

OFFICER
Dead cabbie

OFF Britten and Vega exchanging a look-

EXT PEDESTRIAN SHOPPING MALL - DAY

Britten and Vega step through the large crowds to find a cab
driven up on the curb and into a pole outside a bustling
outdoor shopping mall driver slumped behind the wheel

As they take it in an OFFICER steps up gestures

OFFICER
Cab pulls up Door opens Three
loud bangs Everyone scatters the
driver manages to run up on the
sidewalk until he smacks into this
pole

He turns back to the crowds of people

OFFICER (CONTD)
Everyone reports seeing an
overweight man heavy beard
glasses some kind of ball cap
walking away from the scene Heads
straight into the crowd and then
disappears

Bird steps up

BIRD
No heros today boys just a hundred
something witnesses who can’t wait
to tell you their story Over and
over and over

He tears some sheets out of his notebook hands them to
Britten with a smile

BIRD (CONTD)
Still happy you came back

As Bird goes Britten stares at him It’s weird switching
partners Vega doesn’t seem sorry to see Bird go

VEGA
(muttering)
Burnout

off Britten’s look-

VEGA (CONT’D)
Sorry Just I work my ass off to
get the same job he sleepwalks
through

BRITTEN
Maybe he just knows where to spend
his energy

Britten turns back to the cab follows a line of sight to the
top of a pole across the way On top- a camera

BRITTEN (CONTD)
Wanna take a guess what we’re going
to see

INT PEDESTRIAN SHOPPING MALL - SECURITY OFFICE

Britten Vega and a MALL SECURITY OFFICER are gathered
around the small bank of monitors They focus on one as-

A cab pulls up The door opens AN OVERWEIGHT MAN IN A
TRUCKER HAT starts to get out and as he does fires three
shots through the backseat

The cab lurches forward As people panic the overweight man
looks right at the camera DOFFS HIS CAP and then walks on

Britten freezes the tape on the suspect the face disguised
behind the beard and coke bottle glasses almost useless

BRITTE
I‘1l take this back to the lab see
if they can enhance it

VEGA
What should I do

BRITTEN
Didn’t Bird say something about a
hundred witnesses to interview

OFF Vega’s fading expression-

INT DR LEE’S OFFICE - DAY
Dr Lee looks up from his notes

DR LEE
What does your wife say about your
condition

BRITTEN
(beat)
We don’t talk about it
CUT TO

INT BRITTEN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - FLASHBACK
Britten is talking while Hannah prepares dinner

BRITTEN (VO)
At first I told her everything
That he’d given up football and
one back to tennis About the girl
e was getting calls from

Suddenly Hannah just bursts into tears

BRITTEN (VO) (CONTD)
But it’s not the same for her To
her he’s not still alive it’s just
some dream I keep having And
hearing about it isn’t comforting
it’s torture

INT DR LEE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Britten looks at Lee
BRITTEN

I actually wasn’t looking to come
back to work She sort of forced my

hand

DR LEE
She wanted you to get back to a
routine

BRITTEN

No She wanted to break all our
routines She wanted to move Like
cross the country and start over
She says it’s hard to live with
that empty room upstairs My best
argument for staying was that the
seniority and benefits I’d worked
for wouldn’t follow us

DR LEE
But you don’t really care about
those things You just wanted to
remain where you are

BRITTEN
For me the room upstairs isn’t
empty
Lee notes this
LEE

Detective I’m going to be frank
For you to process what’s happened
heal and move on it’s imperative
that you acknowledge what’s real
and what’s fantasy We can talk
about your dreams but we have to
accept them as just that dreams
Do you understand

Britten eventually nods

LEE (CONT’D)

Let’s talk about your partners Why
do you think they’re different
between your dream and reality

CUT TO

INT POLICE DEPARTMENT

Britten and Vega interview a witness Vega smiles broadly as
Britten makes notes

BRITTEN (VO)
I don’t know I never worked with a
partner before the accident

CUT TO

INT POLICE DEPARTMENT

Britten and Bird are looking over bloody crime scene photos
pointing out various items making notes

BRITTEN (VO 7
They told me they wanted me with
someone for while and I don’t
know I got one in one world and
the other in the other

INT DR EVANS’ OFFICE
Dr Evans is nodding adamantly

DR EVANS
But you said that they don’t like
each other this Bird and Vega

BRITTEN
Vega’s just new Still thinks we
fix things Bird knows better

DR EVANS
It makes perfect sense Your brain
doesn’t want you to know which
world is real and which isn’t It
would defeat the purpose of the
coping mechanism If you had the
same partners you might invent
details about them in your dream
that were disproved in reality and
youd suddenly know which was
which This way you’re free to
create a story for each of them
and their animosity helps keep them
from crossing paths and forcing you
to reconcile what you’ ve imagined
with the truth It’s the same
reason you’ve given yourself
different therapists

INT DR LEE’S OFFICE
Dr Lee closes his notebook
DR LEE
It’s these little details and
differences we should focus on

CUT TO

INT POLICE DEPARTMENT

Britten and Vega step out of the interview room call their
next witness in As they wait Britten looks across the
department at BIRD NOSE IN A BOOK AT HIS DESK oblivious

BRITTEN (VO)
Why

CUT TO

EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET - AFTERNOON

Britten and Bird stand outside of a house There’s a CAR in
the street surrounded by OFFICERS and TECHS

DR LEE (VO)
Because dreams aren’t meant to be
sustained When we pull at the
threads they tend to fall apart

As Britten watches VEGA GETS INTO A CAR DOWN THE BLOCK

DR LEE (VO) (CONT’D)
Your partners are threads And once
we start to pull on them I think
we can help you see the truth

Vega shoots Britten a brief glimpse from the car then drives
away Britten stares after him

The sound of Bird KNOCKING on the house’s door snaps Britten
back to the task at hand An UPPER MIDDLE CLASS HOUSEWIFE
opens the door

BIRD
Ma’‘am Detectives Freeman and
Britten We’re working the Baker
homicides down the street
(beat)
We’re told you noted this car in
the area yesterday

He indicates the car crawling with officers and techs

HOUSEWIFE
Yes We’re all pretty close on the
street You kind of have a sense of
what people drive It just didn’t

look like it fit
BRITTEN
Did you see anyone in or around the
car
HOUSEWIFE

No Is it involved in the case

BIRD
It’s a stolen vehicle It’s
possible the suspect used it to get
into the area and then left it

BRITTEN
When did you notice the vehicle

HOUSEWIFE
(thinking)
I guess around five

This raises eyebrows

BRITTEN
Are you sure

HOUSEWIFE
Yes My husband had just texted me
he was on his way home I could
check the text for the exact time
if you want

BIRD
Why don’t you do that
As she disappears the detectives eye one another thinking

BRITTEN
The father made a call from inside
the house at 530

BIRD
Mom’s car was confirmed home by 6

BRITTEN
And time of death was around 9 So
that means we’ve got the suspect in
the area for almost four hours with
both of his victims home before he
actually strikes

(beat)
When did the girl get dropped off
Bird’s already thinking the same thing

BIRD
Close to 845

Everything clicks in a way Britten was hoping it wouldnt

BRITTEN
If he just wanted to rob a couple
of rich people he had all the time
in the world He didn’t want money
(looking at Bird)
He was after the girl all along

END OF ACT I

AcT II

INT POLICE DEPARTMENT
Britten and Bird address other officers as papers are passed

BRITTEN
This wasn’t random He knew who he
was after and he waited for her
which means he had to have come
into contact with her before the
night of the murders These are all
the registered sex offenders whose
homes or work might have put them
in contact with our missing girl
There’s a lot here so we’re going
to divide them up for the first
sweep If youget someone you can’t
immediately eliminate let Bird or
myself know and we’ll get into them
personally

Everyone breaks up begins to head out Bird starts to gor
looks back to see Britten standing staring at his watc

BIRD
You coming

Britten hesitates Then-

BRITTEN
Ive got something I’ve got to do

BIRD
Now

Britten thinks about that Wavers Then-
BRITTEN
Just take the first couple I only
need an hour or two

BIRD
For what

As Britten starts to go -

BRITTEN
I told someone I’d be somewhere

Bird annoyed and confused watches him leave

EXT TENNIS COURTS - DAY

Britten sits in the bleachers It’s not a packed house but
there’s a fair number of people for a tennis match

On the court Rex tosses up a ball and whips a blistering
serve right past his opponent Britten smiles CLAPS

Suddenly Rexs COACH (TARA) slides in next to Britten

TARA
After two years playing football I
didnt expect him to end up in the
inal

Britten looks over at her 30’s long slender like someone
who not only plays a sport for a living but does it well
She extends her hand

TARA (CONTD)
Tara I’m the coach

BRITTEN
(shakes her hand)
Right

As Rex wins another point-

TARA
He’s exceptionally talented

Britten CLAPS keeps his eyes on Rex

BRITTEN
He had a very good teacher
TARA
(genuine)
I’m so sorry She was an amazing

person
Britten looks at her nods

TARA (CONTD)
You know we used to play doubles
together She could have played
professionally

BRITTEN
You think so

TARA
I did and she was always better
than me I think the grind just
didn’t appeal to her

BRITTEN
But it appealed to you

TARA
dhought it would be more winning
Wimbledon and less qualifying in
New Jersey

Britten smiles A beat

BRITTEN
I’m not sure what he’s doing out
there to be honest

(MORE)

BRITTEN (CONTD)
I know it’s been hard on him but
he doesn’t really tell me much His
mom was the one he talked to

TARA
We’ve talked about it a little

BRITTEN
(surprised a little hurt)
Really

TARA
(easing the blow)
Sometimes it’s just easier for boys
to talk to a woman about that kind
of stuff

BRITTEN
I’ve tried I just my job makes
it hard to be around And the work
is like learning another language
At some point I think I forgot how
to have conversations that weren’t
evidence suspect motive
(beat)
What what’s he say

TARA
Nothin ou don’t know He misses
her a Fots This helps him miss her
a little less

Rex wins another point They both CLAP
TARA (CONTD)
Match point If he wins this easily
after a long layoff I may never get
him to practice

Rex throws the ball up and absolutely HAMMERS it over the
net The other player doesn’t even move Game set match

Britten Tara and the other spectators CLAP and CHEER But
REX JUST STANDS THERE staring over the net Then-

He simply falls to his knees and begins CRYING Not victory
tears Kid who’s lost his mom tears

Britten and Tara rush to him But as they get close it’s
TARA THAT REX GRABS FOR He wraps himself around her and
CRIES into her shoulder

Britten stands watching helpless

INT RESTAURANT - EVENING

Britten Rex and Tara sit at a table in the largely deserted
bar area Each has a soda some picked at fries between them

Rex is recovered but the conversation is mostly two way with
Britten spectating

TARA
No way I watch total garbage TV
and I don’t even watch that

REX
Come on It’s about models

TARA
I think that holds a different
appeal for a 15 year old boy than
it does for me

Rex smiles which Britten sort of marvels at Tara seems to
notice Britten on the outside looking in

TARA (CONTD)
What about you Mark You have a
favorite show

BRITTEN
trying)
Um I don’t know I like that one
with the deranged chef

REX
surprised)
Really I always thought mom
recorded that

BRITTEN
Nope That’s mine
beat

Why You like it

REX
shrugs)
It’s okay
long beat)
Did you see the one where he made
that guy eat the-

Suddenly Britten’s cell RINGS Rex stops mid sentence

BRITTEN
I’m sorry I just-

REX
(flat)
It’s fine

BRITTEN
(answering)
Britten

BIRD
(filter)
Bird We found the Bakers’ car
Waverly Long Term Parking lot by
the airport

(MORE)

BIRD (CONTD
We may have just missed him How
quick can you get here

BRITTEN
Um

He looks at Rex who can already read his mind

REX
You have to go

Britten dies a little at his son’s words Then-
BRITTEN
(into phone)
Ive gotta get Rex home and I’1l be
right there

As he hangs up-
TARA
I can take him if you want

REX
Yeah I’1l get a ride with Tara
It’s clearly not about convenience it’s what Rex wants
BRITTEN
Uh Yeah Okay I’ll um I’11l see
you in a bit then

Rex just nods Britten doesn’t know what else to do He heads
for the door disappointed with how that went

He almost gets there when Rex jogs up behind him

REX
Dad

Britten turns A beat as Rex seems unsure what to say

REX (CONT’D)
Um I’m glad you came today

BRITTEN
Me too

A beat REX HUGS HIM The look on Britten’s face says the
gesture means everything to him They break A long beat

BRITTEN (CONTD)
Your idea or Tara’s

Rex smiles His dad’s not stupid

REX
She’s good at this kind of stuff

BRITTEN
(smiles)
I won’t be late Promise

As Rex goes Britten catches Tara’s eye He mouths ‘thanks’
She smiles nods
EXT WAVERLY LONG TERM PARKING LOT - NIGHT

It’s drizzling Bird is standing under an umbrella by a BMW
as TECHS crawl around it taking pictures

Britten reaches him looks inside the car dried blood all
over the seats Bird motions to the passenger side points
out blood on the ground

BIRD
When they got here they said that
was still fresh

He hands Britten some photos of the same scene but from
earlier when the daylight was just fading He points to the
blood trail

BIRD (CONTD)
Drizzle makes it hard to say but
they think we missed him by less
than 45 minutes

Britten looks around They’re at the edge of a large and
intermittently populated parking lot

BRITTEN
I don’t suppose anyone saw
anything

BIRD

Nope And no cameras But the
stolen car we found in the
neighborhood was taken less than a
mile from here

BRITTEN

So he drives his car to this lot
walks off and steals one to get to
the girl’s house Kills her
parents abducts her and then
comes back here and ditches the
family BMW for his vehicle

(walking along the car)
If you’re going to move a
kidnapping victim from one car to
another you probably don’t park
far away

He looks at the number on the parking space that the BMW is
in 589 He looks at the space right next to it 590

BRITTEN (CONTD)
So we need someone who can tell us
about the car parked in space 590
for the last day anda half Let’s
pull the plates on all these cars
see if anyone remembers it

Bird nods Britten eyes the photos again Notices something

BRITTEN (CONTD)
We should also try to figure out
who was in this space directly
behind 590 611

h BIRD
Why

Britten shows him the photo

BRITTEN

It’s got a dry spot that the rain
hadn’t covered about the same size
as the one in 590 So they probably
left around the same time If
anyone’s going to have seen
anything or remember what was in
space 590 it’s probably whoever was
in 611

(re blood on the ground)
We find any of the girl’s blood in
the house

BIRD
Just the parents

BRITTEN
Well if this was fresh it
certainly 4 didn’t belong to them So
either she’s somehow gotten our
killer bleeding-

They share a look
BIRD
Or we don’t have a lot of time
INT POLICE DEPARTMENT - LATE NIGHT
Britten works the phones Photos of license plates surround
him as well as a drawing on his wall with the space 589 590
and 611 right behind 590 all circled
BRITTEN
Right I’m calling about a car you
left parked at the Waverly Long
Term Parking Lot Yes
SERIES OF SHOTS

We see him crossing license plates off a list

We see his eyes glazing over as he struggles to stay awake
We see him sipping a cup of coffee
Bird steps over

BIRD
Anything

BRITTEN
(shakes his head)
You

BIRD
Nope Apparentl eople don’t
memorize all the Pearby cars when
they park

Britten looks at his watch
BRITTEN
Dammit It’s almost two I told him
I wouldn’t do this

As Britten starts to gather his things-

BIRD
Your boy How’s he handling
things

BRITTEN

(shrugs)
on’t know I can read you better
than him But then I’ve probably
spent more time in the department
than at home over the last fifteen
years

BIRD
Birthdays anniversaries
graduations You name it I’ve
missed it Used to feel bad about
but what we see people stabbed
to death kids taken it’s toxic
waste Work in it you end u
radioactive So for every thing
I’ve missed there’re ten I ruined
because I came home with dead
people on my mind Job’s not just
about catching bad guys It’s about
making sure the people you love
don’t see just how ugly it really
is out there

(beat)
Sometimes staying at your desk
doesn’t mean you’re neglecting
anyone It just means you don’t
want them to see what’s on it

Bird pats the bloody crime scene photos walks off

INT BRITTEN’S CAR - LATE NIGHT

Britten drives Bird’s words ringing in his ears The hand on
the wheel has a GREEN rubber band around the wrist

MATCH CUT TO

INT BRITTEN’S CAR - MORNING
Britten’s hand on the wheel but now with a BLUE rubber band
He fights the morning traffic as he heads for the station

As he sits at a light a YELLOW CAB pulls up beside him He
looks over as the ight changes

Britten starts his turn into the station then notices the
cab pulling to a stop right in front He pauses mid turn

A BLONDE WOMAN IN A BLACK DRESS AND WIDE HAT gets out She
puts her purse on the roof appears to dig for her wallet

Britten is about to dismiss it when BOOM BOOM BOOM the
woman fires a gun from inside her purse right through the
roof of the cab and into the driver

As people SCREAM and start to run the woman looks up at the
station and TIPS HER HAT

Britten jams on the accelerator and TEARS OUT barreling over
the sidewalk towards the cab

The Woman bolts As Britten dodges pedestrians the woman

races into an alleyway between the station and the large
office building next door

When Britten’s way is blocked he abandons the car and leaps
out only to find OFFICERS sprinting towards him guns drawn

OFFICER
FREEZE

Britten slows up reaches into his pocket

OFFICER (CONTD)
DONT

Britten stops slowly draws his badge keeps his tone even
BRITTEN
Detective Britten I’m just getting
my badge

The officer holds his bead as Britten produces his badge A
beat then satisfied they take off towards the alley

EXT ALLEYWAY - MORNING

Britten and the officer run down the deserted alley They
stop unsure which way to pursue

Britten spots a side entrance to the office building

INT OFFICE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Business people move about through the lobby oblivious to
the scene outside As Britten eyes them-

OFFICER
Detective

Britten turns to see the Officer standing next to a trashcan
in an alcove Hanging out is a bit of BLACK FABRIC

Britten walks over to the can pulls the lid off Inside is
the black dress hat and a long blonde wig

Britten looks up making eye contact with various people
moving in and out of the lobby The suspect could be anyone

OFFICER (CONTD)
What are we looking for

Britten looks back at the disguise in the trash

BRITTEN
I wish I knew

END OF ACT IT

AcT III

EXT POLICE DEPARTMENT - MORNING

Britten and Vega are looking at the madhouse of police and
spectators surrounding the murder scene outside the station

VEGA
Should I take statements again

BRITTEN

(shakes his head)
They saw what I saw someone in
disguise who got away with murder
The tapes the witnesses he likes
that we have everything and still
end up with nothing Makes him feel
smarter than us Invisible

(a thought)
Where would you go if you were
invisible

VEGA
I’m going to take the 5th on that

Britten stares into the crowd

BRITTEN
I bet you wouldnt be able to
resist admiring your own handiwork

He turns walking toward the department Vega follows

BRITTEN (CONTD)

Once he ditches the disguise he
could stand in that crowd all day
and we’d never know it

(beat)
We pull the security tapes from all
three scenes but let them run
through the hours after the murder
Maybe we get a face that pops up in
all three crowds

INT POLICE DEPARTMENT

Britten and Vega sit at a monitor when a TECH approaches
holding a plastic bag with a single RED HAIR in it

TECH
Looks like your suspect left
something behind this time

Britten takes the bag eyes it

TECH CONT’D)
Pulled it out of the wig you found
in the trash We’1l run the DNA
but the database is small

(MORE)

TECH (CONTD)
Unless he’s been in serious trouble
before we probably won’t get a hit

VEGA
Hey we know we’re looking for a
red head That’s something right

BRITTEN
Thanks

Britten hands back the bag Vega turns to the monitor

VEGA
First up 611 Waverly
(starting the tape)
Okay carrot top Where are you

The address hits Britten like a brick

BRITTEN
What did you say
VEGA
What
BRITTEN

611 Waverly
FLASH TO
WE SEE the parking space 611 written at the bottom
VEGA (VO)

The restaurant where the cabbie got
killed That’s the address

BACK TO

INT POLICE DEPARTMENT
Britten is struggling to process this

BRITTEN
Did I know that

VEGA
It’s been on the paperwork Why
BRITTEN
There’s a Waverly Parking Lot by

the airport

VEGA
What that’s have to do with this

Britten’s not sure

BRITTEN
Play the tape

INT DR LEE’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON
Dr Lee takes a moment then-

DR LEE
Id say it’s entirely reasonable
even expected that these sorts of
details would begin to cross over

He closes his notes looks at Britten

DR LEE (CONT’D)
Sleep not only recharges us but
actual the REM cycles it’s where we
actually process and store the
day’s information Normally this
all goes unseen or vaguely
remembered as random dreams but
because you’ve constructed an
entire reality out of your sleep
this processing is simply going to
become folded in meaning the
things you’re wrestling with in
real life are likely to manifest
themselves in your dream

BRITTEN
But I knew about the Waverly
parking lot and space 611 before I
new the address of the first cab
murder How could I have dreamed it
before I knew it

DR LEE
You didn’t You said yourself it
was on the paperwork

FLASH TO
WE SEE the address on the side of the building 611
DR LEE (VO) (CONTD

You were at the location Even i
you didn’t consciously note it

our brain did and apparently it

ound it important enough to put
the details-

FLASH TO
WE SEE the Waverly Long Term Parking Lot sign

DR LEE (VO) (CONT’D)
Waverly and 611-

TIGHT ON the 611 in the parking space

DR LEE (VO) (CONT’D)
- into your dream via this
imaginary parking lot

BACK TO

INT DR LEE’S OFFICE
Britten isn’t so sure

BRITTEN
Or I really saw it first in the
parking lot and the dream I’m in
now is repeating it to tell me that
it’s important over there for some
reason

Dr Lee takes a beat

DR LEE
Detective Britten as I’ve said
there’s no therapeutic value in
allowing you to pretend that your
realities are interchangeable
There is no kidnapped child There
is no car in a parking lot And
sadly but crucially there is no
world in which your son has
survived the accident

BRITTEN
What makes you so sure

DR LEE

That this is reality Well for
starters I know I’m real I know I
talked to my wife twenty minutes
before you came in I know what I
ate for breakfast I know where I’m
going this evening

BRITTEN
I could just be inventing all those
details as part of my dream

DR LEE
Then let’s try looking at it from
the perspective of causality Which
murder happened first

BRITTEN
Well the cab driver

DR LEE
So you begin a case in reality and
then suddenly you’re working a case
in your dream

(MORE )
A beat

DR LEE (CONTD)
As one story unfolds the other
twists and turns in response as you
process the days’ events and
sometimes as you key on a detail it
calls specific attention to itself
in your imagination The
consequence of returning to work in
your condition is that in addition
to trying to keep your son alive
you’re using your dreams to try to
solve your cases

BRITTEN
But-—
DR LEE
We should also examine the e of

case you’re working in your ream
A missing child The very issue
youre struggling to come to terms
with So your subconscious turns it
into a case you have to solve

gbeat)

I understand the pain you feel
Detective But once you accept that
this is reality you’ll release
your son from your dreams and you
can begin the crucial process o
mourning him and ending that pain

BRITTEN
So as soon as I accept that he’s
dead he’1l stop showing up

DR LEE
I believe that’s very likely

Britten absorbs that thought

INT HIGH END RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Britten and Hannah well-dressed sit among others equally

so trying to be a couple instead of grieving parents

BRITTEN
You already applied

HANNAH
What You think I’m too old

BRITTEN
I’m sure you can still do keg
stands with the best of them I
just what about your work

HANNAH

Britten senses she’s trying to draw him into something He
resists

BRITTEN
I see

Where are these schools at

HANNAH
One’s in the city One’s in Oregon
BRITTEN
Oregon
HANNAH

It’s a really great program

BRITTEN
I thought we talked about this

HANNAH
Then let’s see if I get in before
we talk about it again

This isn’t how he wants the night to go A long beat He
tries to shift gears

BRITTEN
You you remember that time we
were at that restaurant like this
in New York and you pretended to be
a food critic Got us that amazing
table huge meal all for free

HANNAH
What made you think of that

BRITTEN
I don’t know Maybe I was thinking
about how persuasive you can be

HANNAH
(smiling)
I must have been Who believes a 23
ear old who orders fries with her
obster is a critic

Britten LAUGHS But Hanah’s smile is muted Long beat

HANNAH (CONT’D)

You know they say there’s a point
in every relationship w where you
stop talking about what you’re

doing and only talk about what you

She sees this suck the life out of him

HANNAH (CONTD)
I’m sorry I don’t know what’s
wrong with me

(MORE )

HANNAH (CONT’D)
I mean we can say it’s time Say
we need to get dressed go out like
normal people again have a good
time but I wonder if there’s
ever a point where having a good
time isn’t going to feel wrong

She looks down

HANNAH (CONTD)
I guess saying it out loud doesn’t
really help the cause

BRITTEN
It’s okay I know what you mean

A beat

BRITTEN (CONTD)
How’s the house coming

HANNAH
Just one room to go

He nods They both know which one that is As he thinks on it
his words just slip out

BRITTEN
I saw him play a match the other
day

She looks confused slightly troubled

HANNAH
Who

He catches himself

BRITTEN
My new partner- his son he’s on
e tennis team He invited me out

HANNAH
Oh

Britten can’t help it He smiles with pride

BRITTEN
He was amazing Twenty five aces in
the final Reminded me of you

HANNAH
Me

BRITTEN
Yeah Just the way he crushed the
ball The way he poured himself
into it It was almost like I
was watching you

She’s sees right though him knows he’s talking about Rex
She puts down her napkin stands

She walks away

puts his hands on her shoulders apologetic

MARK

She looks back at him
HANNAH

A beat and then they kiss It’s gentle careful like they’re
not sure they’re ready for all this As they continue-

play with the BLUE rubber band on his wrist

Long SILENCE Then-

I think that we should get
pregnant

She can sense his reaction Jumping ahead of it-

HANNAH (CONTD)
I know it’s fast And you can say
whatever you want about working
through issues and all of that but
this is not about replacing him I
just know that I’m going to want
another one and I don’t want and be
a hundred when he’s in high school

Britten sits on this unsure what to say

BRITTEN
How do you know it would be a boy

END OF ACT III

ACT IV

INT DR EVANS’ OFFICE
Dr Evans seems more incensed than we’ve seen her

DR EVANS
That’s ridiculous Trying to force
you into some revelation is not his
job The coping mechanism is there
for a reason to let you deal with
this when you’re ready

BRITTEN
But he’s right Things seem to
start there and get repeated here
I had the cab driver case and then
suddenly I had this one

DR EVANS
You knew you were coming back to
work You could have dreamed up a
case in anticipation as your mind
had already begun to focus on what
youd be up against Notice that
the cab driver murders didn’t
become an ongoing SERIES of murders
until AFTER you were faced with an
ongoing situation where a child was
missing

Britten shakes his head

BRITTEN
I can’t even keep this straight

DR EVANS
You don’t need to At this point
that’s not where I think our focus
should lie

BRITTEN

That’s exactly what Dr Lee would
expect you to say He’d tell me
that the only reason you’re
agreeing with me is because you ARE
me just my imagination trying to
hold onto the idea that this dream
could be real

Dr Evans takes a beat

DR EVANS
Okay

She goes to her computer Types something in hits print As
pages start to come out of her printer she grabs a small
stack and brings them over hands them to Britten

DR EVANS (CONT’D)
Here

He looks at the pages Before he can ask-—

DR EVANS (CONTD)
Turn to any page Just pick one

He hesitates then flips through He stops on the third page
DR EVANS (CONTD)

Now Pick a spot somewhere about
half way down and start reading

Out lou

BRITTEN
What-

DR EVANS
Read

He looks at the page Begins

BRITTEN

Qualifications requisite for -

(breaks)
What the hell are we doing

She looks at him

DR EVANS
Have you memorized the entire
constitution
BRITTEN
(baffled)
No
DR EVANS

Then if this is a dream if your
son has really died instead of your
wife and you’re just making all
this up explain to me how you
turned to a random page and were
able to read it back word for
word

Britten is dumbstruck

BRITTEN
I I don’t know

DR EVANS
Tell Dr Lee that Dr Evans says
it’s not as simple as he made it
sound

The more he thinks about it the more bothered he becomes

BRITTEN
Why would you do that

DR EVANS
What do you mean I just thought if
I could counter balance the-

BRITTEN
You just said we shouldn’t be
trying to force any sort of
realization and then I mean how

could I possibly have done that
unless-

Britten’s phone rings

BRITTEN (CONT’D)
Britten

BIRD
(filter)
We got a suspect

BRITTEN
On my way

He hangs up Stands

Yeah you know him young guy
ready to commit a murder and Solve
it just to get a promotion This
just might be his ticket

(looks at a sheet
Registered sex offender with two
priors works at the car wash
Records show the family was there
eleven times in the last six
months Found his prints in the

You just said he worked at the car
wash

AND pictures of various kids from

Want to guess who one of the stars
of that show is

He hands Britten photos of the missing girl

BIRD (CONTD)
He’s got no alibi for the night of
the murders or for the period of
time when the car would have been
left at the parking lot DA says
she’s probably got enough to
indict

BRITTEN
We find his car

BIRD
Doesn’t have one Rides the bus
There’s a stop two blocks from
where the first car was stolen
Figure he takes the family BMW back
to the parking lot and steals
another one we’re not looking for
For all we know that car and the
girl are at the bottom of a lake

They arrive at the interrogation room

BIRD (CONTD)
If she is still alive the only way
were going to find her is to get
him to tell us where so let’s keep
him heading in that direction

Britten nods stops just before they go in

BRITTEN
Does he have red hair

BIRD
(thrown
Red hair No Why

Britten isn’t even sure himself

BRITTEN
I don’t know

I think with just a little more
time Detectives-

BIRD
We’ve got it thanks

Vega grudgingly steps aside Bird takes a seat Britten seems
caught looking at Vega then back at the suspect’s hair

BIRD (CONTD)
Mr Taylor Detective Freeman This
is Detective Britten I’m going to
be frank and this is going to be
fast You are in a significant
mess The pornographic material by
itself was already a violation of
your parole We also have your
prints in the victims’ car as well
as your own private photos of the
missing girl It’s a double murder
with or without her so you’re not
saving fer at from anything by
hiding her At this point her
location is the ONLY and I repeat
ONLY thing you can use to help
yourself We find her alive maybe
the rest of your life gets a little
longer So let’s talk about where
you went after you left the BMW at
the Waverly parking lot

TAYLOR
(exasperated terrified)
Please I already told the officer
I don’t know what you’re talking
about

Britten takes a seat next to Bird They both sound
sympathetic

BRITTEN
She was bleeding Was she hard to
control Was she fighting you

BIRD
You needed to go someplace private
right Some place you could be
alone Did you drive out of the
city Where did you go

Taylor starts to CRY

TAYLOR
I told you I was at home

VEGA
Watching TV by yourself is not an
alibi
Taylor just puts his head down CRYING Vega makes a
dismissive gesture Britten finds himself staring at the top
of the guys head At his thinning BROWN hair

It’s football He could have heard
about the game anywhere

BRITTEN
I didn’t ask about the game I
asked about the commentary

Bird looks at Britten

He’d have needed to have watched
the game or to have seen a tape to
memorize commentary and since he
an alibi to
begin with I doubt he watched the
game on tape to create one

didn’t think he ha

Vega wants to say something but thinks better of it

still looks a little frayed

Can you just let me think

VEGA
Can you at least tell me what we’re
looking for Maybe I can help

BRITTEN
I’m not sure

VEGA
Then why are we here

Dismissive-

I had a dream about it

Or I’m having a dream about it

What

BRITTEN
Nothing Will you just-

VEGA
Weve still got partial face
matches from the tapes to look
over There’re witnesses to
interview from the scene outside
the station There’s-—

Britten looks up at the side of the building The big
numerals 611 stare back at him

BRITTEN
Shh

Britten focuses on the numbers waiting for them to tell him
something Then he notices-

The windows of the apartment building just above them He
squints at the windows then down the street A thought

BRITTEN (CONTD)
The witness

VEGA
What

BRITTEN
The witness from the 611 building
He said the killer ran up the
street around that corner and into
the alley

VEGA
exasperated )
All the witnesses said that That’s
what the security tape shows
That’s what happened

Britten looks back at the numbers

BRITTEN
Did anyone actually go to the guy’s
apartment Look out his window

VEGA
Why I just told you Everyone had
the same story

BRITTEN

Because if you’re looking out of
that building there’s no way you
can see around that corner From
the ground you could have seen the
killer go up that alley But from
up there there’s no way you know
at unless-

VEGA
(Holy shit)
You happened to be the one who
actually did it

Britten looks at Vega

BRITTEN
He likes to feel smart Invisible
What’s going to make you feel more
invisible than actually talking to
the detectives trying to catch you

They both stare up at the windows of the apartment building

start to close

The HASID glances back everso slightly His eyes meet
Britten’s The two of them lock on one another Even in the
garb Britten sees it It’s the WITNESS

As the doors close the Hasid cracks a tiny smile

Britten rushes for the elevator but it’s too late He flies
into the stairwell Vega confused tries to keep up
EXT 611 WAVERLY APARTMENT BUILDING

Britten hits the street spots the Hasid bolting up the
block Britten breaks into a dead sprint not willing to miss
his man a second time

Britten makes up ground The Hasid seems to be slowing when-

Suddenly the Hasid stops turns gun drawn Britten freezes
his own weapon still in its holster Then in a FLASH-

TWO SHOTS The Hasid goes down Britten turns to see Vega a
hundred feet behind gun drawn

They move in on the downed body On the ground the hat and
hair have gone slightly askew revealing not only that it is
indeed the witness but his red hair underneath

EXT 611 WAVERLY APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

Britten and Vega are now surrounded by other officers the
coroner onlookers

As the body is loaded into the rear of an ambulance-

Britten just stares at the address on the outside of the
building 611 Waverly

CUT TO

EXT WAVERLY LONG TERM PARKING LOT
Britten stands staring at space 611 case file in his hand
Bird stands behind him sipping coffee

BIRD
Britten youve been staring at the
avement for the last hour I think
it’s told you what it knows

Britten shakes his head in his own little world

BRITTEN
This has to be it

The blood trail led right to the
car in 590 Why does it matter what
was parked in e109 Don’t you think
if they’d have seen anything like
say a bleeding little girl being
forced out of one car and into
another wed have heard from them

Britten thinks about that He opens the file looks at the
photos of the scene again The back to back dry spots in
space 590 and 611

And then it hits him

BRITTEN
Oh my God 611 That’s what it was
trying to tell me It was in 611

He drops everything else holds the picture close

BRITTEN (CONTD)
We had it backwards

Bird steps over

BRITTEN (CONTD)
There was no car in 590

BIRD
But the blood trail-
Britten points to the photo

BRITTEN
These two cars didn’t leave at
about the same time They left at
EXACTLY the same time

He points to a little thread of dry pavement between the dry
spaces where the cars were parke

BRITTEN (CONT’D
See that little strip of dry
pavement That means there was
something above it Something
connecting whatever was in these
two spaces

BIRD
(getting it)
A tow hitch
BRITTEN
It wasn’t a car in 590 It was a
camper or something else he could
stick her in The car was in 611

OFF Bird-

INT BRITTEN’S CAR

Britten and Bird are driving Bird is on the phone

BIRD
Yeah Yeah Send it over
(hanging up)

BIRD (CONTD)

Four camper hits in the same area
we canvassed for sex offenders
Three of them are sitting in their
driveways One’s not Neighbor says
it’s been gone since Monday

BRITTEN
Day of the murders

BIRD
Says the guy talks about a lake up
in the foothills Vega’s sending us
a description of the area the
camper and the guy’s ID

Bird taps at his laptop Suddenly he freezes

BIRD (CONTD)
What the hell

BRITTEN
What

Bird turns the screen to Britten It’s an ID PHOTO from a
drivers license The MAN in the photo has RED HAIR

BIRD
You want to explain to me how you
knew he was going to be a red head

OFF Britten’s look -

EXT CAMPGROUND - AFTERNOON

Britten and Bird spot a camper attached to a truck parked by
an idyllic looking little lake They move toward it
carefully guns drawn

INT CAMPER

Britten swings the door open darts in gun out But it’s
quiet And then he hears something MUFFLED

He opens the closet sized bathroom finds an YOUNG GIRL
bound and gagged inside

He quickly pulls her out begins to release her As soon as
the gag comes down she simply starts to CRY Britten takes
her in his arms when-
The door to the camper opens
MAN (0C)
We’ll have a good fire tonight I
got us-

As the man steps in and notices Bird and Britten he freezes

He grabs for a knife on the counter but Bird’s gun is up

BIRD
Don’t even think about it

A beat and then the MAN bolts

Bird is out the door after him but Britten doesn’t move He
just sits there holding the girl Outside we hear-

TWO SHOTS
A long beat as the girl just CRIES into Britten’s shoulder-

DR LEE (VO)
I think the red hair settles it in
just the way we’ve been looking
for

INT DR LEE’S OFFICE

Dr Lee looks like aman with all the answers Britten
doesn’t seem particularly threatened

DR LEE

There’s no evidence suggesting the
suspect in your kidnapping case
would have red hair e only
reason he did is because it’s a
reflection of the REALITY in which
your actual suspect in the cab

river murders which came first
had red hair Tf this were a dream

ou’d have come up with the red

air clue before it occurred in
reality Which would make you
psychic

BRITTEN
(unfazed)
So the red hair proves this is
reality And reading the
constitution proves the other’s
realit So we’re back where we
starte

DR LEE
Remembering a portion of the
constitution proves nothing I
could put you under hypnosis and
drag out a litany of facts and
tidbits from your subconscious that
you d be stunned to find hiding
there

CUT TO

INT BRITTEN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN
Britten works with a MUCH YOUNGER REX cutting and gluing

DR LEE (VO)
Perhaps you helped your son with a
project at some point and very
specific portions of the
constitution found their way into
your memory In the trancelike
state of your dreams you simply
dredged them up to help deceive
yourself

ANGLE ON the project at hand A Constitutional diorama

CUT TO
INT DR LEE’S OFFICE
Britten smiles
BRITTEN
By that logic I could just as
easily have come across a red hair
in the kidnapping case and never
consciously noticed it
CUT TO

INT BRITTEN’S HOUSE - MARK’S BEDROOM

Britten looks down at his suit jacket the one he’s been
wearing the whole time He stares at the sleeve He reaches
down and picks off a single red hair Stares at it

CUT TO

INT BAKER HOUSE - GIRL’S BEDROOM - FLASHBACK

As Britten reaches into the closet to smell the carpet his
sleeve contacts the hanging clothes picking up the red hair

BRITTEN (VO)
Maybe I picked it up during the
investigation and the only way to
bring it to my attention was to
make it a detail of my dreams

INT DR LEE’S OFFICE
Britten looks happy with himself
BRITTEN

The dreams in which I have to come
see you

Dr Lee nods Okay

DR LEE
Youve created a mental Mobius
strip Your mind is free to go back
and fill in any hole if you let it
So if you re unwilling to commit
yourself to making meaningful
rogress I’m not sure why you’re
ere

BRITTEN
I’m here because they told me I
had to come

Dr Lee takes a beat Then -

DR LEE
Your Blood Alcohol Level was
elevated the night of the accident
wasn’t it

This suddenly sucks the wind out of Britten’s sails

BRITTEN
I don’t drink

DR LEE
Thats what you said in the re ort
but it was elevated was it no

Britten is silent

DR LEE (CONTD)
Perhaps your condition comes not so
much from a benevolent desire to
keep your son alive but an intense
need to try to shield yourself from
your ¢ own responsibility for his

ea

INT DR EVANS’ OFFICE
Dr Evans looks concerned

DR EVANS
It does raise a host of questions

BRITTEN
I’m telling you I never drink And
if I did my wife would never have
let me get ehind the wheel

DR EVANS
And you don’t remember anything
about the night leading up to the
accident

CUT TO

EXT HILLSIDE - NIGHT

CLOSE ON Britten waking up bloody hanging from his
seatbelt

BRITTEN (VO)
No

EXT HILLSIDE - LATER

Britten is taken in one ambulance as his wife and son still
unconscious are put into another

CUT TO
INT DR EVANS’ OFFICE
She’s thinking
DR EVANS
Maybe this is all your way of
trying to remember
(to explain)
Just as you seem to work out your
cases in your dreams I wonder if
the entire construction of those
dreams is meant to try to draw your
attention to something bigger
Maybe that your wife survived in
one and your son in the other or
the fact that youhave differént
partners is actually all a way of
getting you to think about that
night Clues so to speak as to
what actually happened
CUT TO

INT POLICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT
Vega is doing paperwork at his desk

BRITTEN
What are you still doing here

VEGA
You see all this stuff Guy had
like a hundred different costumes
in that apartment was still
showing up to teach 8th grade math
everyday Nobody suspected a thing

BRITTEN
It’s one in the morning Don’t you
have someone waiting for you

VEGA
I don’t care if I got the promotion
just to hold your hand I’m gonna
prove I deserve it My wife
understands

A beat

BRITTEN
Vega Trust me Go home

Britten turns to leave but Vega doesn’t move Britten
shrugs As Britten starts to walk-

VEGA
You were joking right

BRITTEN

whats ey)

VEGA
About going back to that crime
scene because of a dream That’s
not why we went right Cause you
know weird stuff like that it’s
sort of what they told me £6 look
out for

OFF Britten’s expression-

CUT TO

EXT CAMPGROUND

Police everywhere ambulance reporters Bird steps next to
Britten They see the GIRL with officers

BIRD

She says he kept talking about
marrying her That the Lord had
brought them together

(long beat)
So the red hair The obsession
with that parking space They’re
going to ask how you put all that

together
BRITTEN
Right
(a beat

Can we call it a hunch for now
Bird looks at him

BIRD
Ive been a cop for thirty years
Only seen hunches on TV But for
now okay we go with hunch
Britten and HANNAH are in black

We see the Girl being led into an ambulance

BRITTEN
What happens to her

BIRD
She goes to an aunt or something
I’m not sure she even understands
what’s happened yet

BIRD (CONTD)
Remember when you used to think
solved and fixed meant the same
thing

INT DR LEE’S OFFICE

Lee leans forward

DR LEE
Detective turning yourself in
circles like this over and over
it will catch up with you This
fantasy is far from a benign coping
mechanism When your brain should
be resting recharging you’re
using it to hold up a detailed and
complicated alternate reality A
reality that only gets more
complicated the lon gr it exists
That is unsustainable Detective
Britten I’m afraid that the longer
you continue the more you
jeopardize your already tenuous
grasp on reality It is quite
simply a road to madness

A long beat as this weighs on Britten Then-

BRITTEN
The thing is doctor -

EXT GRAVEYARD - DAY

BRITTEN (VO)

my son

As they watch the ambulance doors close behind the girl-

CUT TO

INT BRITTEN’S HOUSE - REX’S ROOM

Britten assists Hannah clearing out the last of Rex’s stuff
She looks at him leans down opens a paint can

BRITTEN (VO 7
And when you see a loved one being
buried the one thought you have
over and over and over again is
that you would give ANYTHING to
change it

Suddenly her ‘move past it’ exterior cracks and she finally
begins to CRY As he pulls her into his arms-

CUT TO

EXT TENNIS COURTS

Britten sits alone in the stands watching Rex practicing
relentlessly with his coach TARA

BRITTEN (VO)
So if you’re telling me that the
price of being able to see them to
eel them to have them is my
sanity-

After crushing a forehand that sends Tara sprawling Rex
looks up at his father smiles

Britten and his wife lay in bed together only a sliver of
light sneaking through the window A LONG SILENCE Then -

HANNAH
Will you see him tonight

Britten looks over at her He’s not sure what she wants to
hear He simply opts for the truth

BRITTEN
Yes

She takes that in He prepares himself for the
recriminations Instead she kisses him on the cheek

Softly-

HANNAH
Tell him that I love him

As she turns away Britten fights the lump in his throat

BRITTEN
I will

Britten closes his eyes

We push in very close on his closed eyelids A long beat
Then-

He opens them
