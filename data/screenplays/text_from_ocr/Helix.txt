INT DARK ROOM - NIGHT
Hard breathing As if through a tunnel

A RUBBER HAND wipes the surface of a MASK clear We’re
looking through this mask We read on a STEEL PLATE -

INFECTIOUS AREAS NO UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY

The mask tilts down -

TO OPEN THIS DOOR PLACE ID ON SENSOR

The same gloved hand reaches out places a hard plastic BADGE
against the electronic eye A digital screen reads -

PROCESSING
Then

YOU ARE CLEAR TO PROCEED DR FRANK PEDERSON US ARMY

The heavy carbon door slides open leading to a chamber where
Pederson is met by another man wearing the same orange RACAL
SUIT This is DR HIROSHI HATAKI Hataki muffled American
accent speaks through the reinforced mask -

HATAKT
Where were you

PEDERSON
(tough slighty southern)
Hunting polar bears Where the hell
do you think

WHITE DETOXIFYING GAS shoots down from the ceiling Painting
them Cleansing them

PEDERSON (CONTD)
Youre overreacting by doing this
in here You’1l spook the other
scientists

HATAKT
They’re scientists And who says
they know we’re here

The gas stops and almost instantly the milky residue on
their suits evaporates Hataki extends his hand places his
own ID BADGE over the next sensor
PROCESSING
Then

YOU ARE CLEARED TO PROCEED DR HIROSHI HATAKI ROLAND
PHARMACEUTICALS

The next chamber opens -

BIOSAFETY LEVEL 2 CAUTION ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT

Pederson and Hataki enter Both lift their arms Pederson now
towers over the other man

PEDERSON
The investors then The Brazilians

HATAKT
They left yesterday

Even through the mask we can see this is news to Pederson
STROBE LIGHTS envelop the room Then stop The next door
opens -

BIOSAFETY LEVEL 3 NEGATIVE PRESSURE ZERO TOLERANCE The
back door SLAMS behind them

PEDERSON
If it was what you thought we’d be
dead already That or -

But we don’t get to hear it Instead a VACUUM sucking the
life out of the room It’s deafeningly loud then powers down
much the way a hair dryer does A KEYPAD emerges -

CAUTION EXTREME BIOHAZARD LEVEL 4 ENTER ID CODE

Both do

YOU ARE CLEARED TO ENTER

The final door opens revealing -

INT DISECTION ROOM - DAY

The walls look like something from fifty years into the
future But on a very normal looking surgical table -

An overweight MAN lays naked Limp Both Pederson and Hataki
remove SURGICAL TOOLS from a shelf approach the body

PEDERSON
So you suspect
HATAKT
I prefer to keep an open mind
Stomach

PEDERSON
I’ll do it

Pederson selects a large curved knife and slowly expertly
begins to open a slit above the man’s navel

PEDERSON (CONTD)
Ten bucks says we find an
undigested donut in here Jelly or
powdered

Hataki doesn’t respond Pederson continues with the cut But
before he can finish the man’s stomach FALLS open spilling -

LIQUEFIED GUTS in every direction It’s like his insides have
been DIED BLACK and sent through a blender

PEDERSON (CONTD)
What the -

Both jump back Pederson slips in the mess falls to the

ground But the insides keep coming as if being FORCIBLY
EVACUATED Pederson’s alarmed but Hataki’s calm as ever
Part of him almost looksintrigued

HATAKTI
Check the mouth and neck Quick

Pederson jumps around the expanding pool of sludge opens the
mouth There’s blood And the teeth appear a littletoo
long He then feels the neck when -

The entire head falls off It descends to the floor as -

PEDERSON (0C)
Holy shit We have a code grey

INT CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (CDC) ATLANTA - DAY

DR ALAN FARRAGUT (early 40’s) - glasses tweed handsome in
an academic kind of way - carefully dissects something on his
desk We pull back to reveal - it’s a PLASTIC MODEL BOAT

A KNOCK at the door A younger doctor SARAH JORDAN (mid
20s) thin timid and excited just to be there enters

JORDAN
You sure you want to see this It
is your last day

Farragut places the last sail on the beam looks up

FARRAGUT
This place is my life I want to
see everything

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Farragut clearly the authority figure in the room watches
as Dr Jordan presents -

JORDAN
We originally thought BCM-8 was a
derivative strand of AP-4 but
after distilling it -

An IMAGE of a CELLULAR STRAND cut in half

JORDAN (CONTD)
- we confirmed that it was a by-
product of normal cellular
division and hence an improvement
upon the original strain Darwinism
triumphs again

Polite APPLAUSE from the group Another senior researcher
DR KATHERINE WALKER (mid 30’s) - short spiky hair slightly
butch but also pretty - shoots Farragut a mocking look

Farragut ignores it

FARRAGUT
Very impressive Dr Jordan Though
perhaps we should shy away from
science versus God undertones
(MORE )
FARRAGUT (CONTD)
This may be a government agency
but we are in Georgia

Friendly laughter Jordan appreciative smiles back

INT CDC HALLWAY - DAY
Farragut walks with Walker

WALKER
(intentional)
And I swear to God if I have to
listen to another ‘prodigy’ from
Yale rediscover gravity in that
room

FARRAGUT
The girl’s brilliant She just
needs a chance to prove it
Besides that’s Pete Jordan’s
daughter

Walker looks up with surprise but says nothing

FARRAGUT (CONTD)
And didn’t you go to Yale

WALKER
But I hated it My parents forced
me
(then)
You sure you want to go back to
that world

FARRAGUT
I’m sure I don’t But my wife
deserves to know her husband isn’t
being attacked by deadly microbes
every day A university setting
gives her that

WALKER
Unless you’re eating in the dining
hall

Farragut half grins takes in his surroundings He’s had a
good twenty years here He begins a rare smile when -

MAJOR SERGIO BALLESEROS - short in military uniform
and built like a tank - approaches from behind cutting
through the rest of the staff like a hot knife
This guy clearly isn’t a doctor Just as clear
intimidated by them

BALLESEROS
Dr Farragut

But before Farragut can turn Balleseros steps
stops him in his tracks

BALLESEROS (CONTD)
Major Balleseros Army Engineer
Corp Fort Bragg We have a
problem sir
(before Farragut can
object)
And yes I know it’s your last day

Balleseros turns gestures for them to follow
BALLESEROS (CONTD)
Come with me

(then)
Now please

INT TRANSMISSION ROOM - DAY

- he isn’t

around him and

It’s like the Pentagon War Room but for doctors Farragut
and Walker enter see their boss GENERAL MAX AEROV (50s) to

their left This is serious and they know it

FARRAGUT
Shit

Walker starts to leave

AEROV
She should stay

FARRAGUT WALKER

Shit Okay
Balleseros takes a seat beside Aerov
AEROV (CONTD)
(to Farragut)
Look I’m sorry to have to -
FARRAGUT
Spare me the emotional plea till

the end Deal

Aerov nods slowly - fine
AEROV
Eleven hours ago we received an
unidentified distress call from the
Area 32 International Research
facility

FARRAGUT
Area 32

AEROV
International territory No one
country holds jurisdiction No one
set of laws

WALKER
In other words no laws at all Who
do we think placed the call

AEROV
It was an unauthorized leak through
an off-grid device We contacted
the base directly for confirmation
they denied it We contacted the
military to see if they’d also
picked up the distress call they
sent us this gentleman

Aerov gestures towards Balleseros who stares straight back

WALKER
And the purpose of the facility

BALLESEROS
What we’re dealing with is an
isolated incident that is non-
relevant to the facilities mandate

Farragut and Walker exchange a look - what

AEROV

(anticipating)
In addition to performing the
structural evaluation Major
Balleseros will serve as the
military liaison on the case

(off their concern)
The Major is well versed in working
under scientists

Farragut and Walker exchange another look - yeah right
BALLESEROS
What’s important is that an
unidentified pathogen has infected
two doctors

(then)
USAMRIID’s concerned it might be a
retrovirus
WALKER
(dubious)
Do you even know what a retrovirus
is
AEROV

(stopping the pissing war)
One of the doctors is catatonic
The other’s already bled out

Silence

AEROV (CONTD)
Look this case is sensitive There
are over one hundred scientists
from thirty UN countries in that
facility We only need you to
confirm that this is not a
retrovirus Whole thing should take
twenty four hours

Farragut’s unimpressed stands to leave

FARRAGUT
Dr Walker is an excellent
diagnostician You should put her
on the case immediately

Aerov and Balleseros exchange a look Farragut’s weary -

FARRAGUT (CONT’D)
And now go ahead and tell me why
I’m the only guy who can do this

Balleseros takes a deep breath preparing to drop the bomb -

BALLESEROS

The dead index patient is Dr Paul
Farragutyour brother

(then)
He’s still up there What’s left of
him

(then)
Twenty four hours
EXT CDC - DAY
Farragut storms towards his car Walker follows

FARRAGUT
You sat there saying nothing You
owe me more than that

Walker’s face - I owe you

FARRAGUT (CONTD)
I was set up

WALKER
Set up how They came to you
because he’s family -

FARRAGUT
Fort Bragg doesn’t operate on
courtesy They came to me because -

WALKER
Youre the best
(then)
Don’t flatter yourself I could do
this on my own

FARRAGUT
Then do Because I’m not going

Walker grabs him by the arm
WALKER

I know you’re upset I also know

you want to go
The two stare at each other - and we know Walker’s right
Farragut shakes her off gets into an old Volvo and drives
off
INT FARRAGUT HOUSE - DAY

A Victorian home in the final stages of being packed up

Farragut enters quietly stands in the doorway and watches
his wife -

MARGARET good natured pretty but slightly too thin
pack a box of wedding photos She moves about her task with
an excitement that breaks Farragut’s heart Finally -

FARRAGUT
Hi

Margaret looks up smiles She clearly loves him too

MARGARET
Youre home early Good I could
use another pair of hands

Farragut walks over kneels beside her But instead of
helping he just sits there

She looks up smiles again He smiles back sadly And with
that one look she knows

EXT FARRAGUT’S BACKYARD - DAY

Farragut sits with his wife on a porch swing She’s curled up
against him trying to act braver than she actually feels as
they rock back and forth

FARRAGUT
I don’t have to go

MARGARET
He’s your brother

FARRAGUT
But we hadn’t even spoken in twenty
years The guy didn’t even come to
our wedding

MARGARET
You almost didn’t come to our
wedding

For a brief moment both laugh These two have a long
history She takes his hand

MARGARET (CONTD)
Ill be fine

FARRAGUT
You deserve better than this I
keep saying that but -

MARGARET
One last case isn’t going to kill
us

Margaret immediately regrets her choice of words buries her
head into him

FARRAGUT
I don’t have to go

MARGARET

- but you should You know you
should

More silence

FARRAGUT
Youre the only family that matters
to me

MARGARET
Youre the only family that’s ever
mattered to me

She wraps up against him even tighter Then -

MARGARET (CONTD)
When do you leave

Farragut starts to answer then stops Runs his hand through
her hair And she knowing him all too well -

MARGARET (CONTD)
There’s a car waiting outside
isn’t there

HARD CUT TO

INT ARMY HELICOPTER - TWILIGHT

Farragut now in a military jump suit sits with Walker
Major Balleseros andSarah Jordan

Jordan thick reading glasses now fogged over looks even
skinnier in gear She shakes from the cold Walker removes
her own jacket hands it to Jordan revealing a frame that’s -

Feminine shapely but ripped If we had to fight any of
these four Walker would be last on the list

And she knows it

FARRAGUT

We’re going to follow normal
expedited protocol - explore
isolate identify and get the hell
out of there

(specifically to Walker)
No vanity research

(then)
I want to be back on this copter by
nightfall Understood

JORDAN
(to Farragut)
Thanks again for assigning me

Walker not convinced herself tries to smile while
Balleseros just stares - worried by the newbie

FARRAGUT
(nipping it in the bud)
Every team needs a pathologist to
work the cultures You’re the best
I’ve seen in twenty years I mean
that

JORDAN
(excited to everyone)
Thank you And I know I’m new but -

FARRAGUT
(firm to everyone)
Everyone’s new until they aren’t

Cased closed

BALLESEROS
Well be briefed on the parameters
when we land

The team collectively leans back Walker looks at Farragut

WALKER
Your wife’s a good woman

Farragut stares back sadly but it’s lost on Jordan

JORDAN
Tomorrow is my one year
anniversary

Jordan proudly holds up a picture of herself with her
husband He’s as dorky as she is and it makes her
awkwardness even more endearing

FARRAGUT
You should have said something

JORDAN
And miss an opportunity like this
My husband understands Besides I
want to be part of a team

Farragut looks the four over they’re hardly a team

JORDAN (CONTD)
(to Balleseros)
What about you

WALKER
He’s single Army always sends one
single man to keep the rest of us
in check Who better to make the
hard decisions than someone with
nothing

Ballerseros pulls a small SILVER CROSS from his camo jacket

BALLESEROS
I wouldn’t say nothing

Walker smirks Jordan observes Walker’s empty ring finger

JORDAN
But you’re not married either

FARRAGUT
Walker was a staunch defender of
the ‘Don’t ask don’t tell’ policy

Balleseros smirks back - so she’s gay

WALKER
I goddam loved that policy

Quiet LAUGHTER until - the helicopter BANKS left begins its
approach revealing -

Miles of FROZEN TUNDRA in every direction It’s beautiful AND

terrifying The laughter stops They’re in the fucking Arctic

PILOT
(intercom)
Welcome to the Circle

Suddenly - the helicopter SWERVES from a violent gust of
wind A plastic satchel falls from a ledge which Balleseros
lighting quick - scary quick - catches

Walker notices And now she’s even more wary The other two
oblivious catch their breath and relax

FARRAGUT
(to Balleseros)
I told my wife I’d be here one day
I was serious

Balleseros tightens his mouth looks away

EXT AREA 32 INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH BASE - DAY

The helicopter touches down and our foursome are immediately
greeted by Pederson and Hataki Now without their suits on -

Pederson is beyond huge He could play football for the Jets
Hataki meanwhile is extremely handsome with sharp features
and deep eyes - the Japanese George Clooney

Both men are clearly unhappy to have visitors Pederson steps
forward

PEDERSON
Colonel Frank Pederson Army
Procurement

Pederson and Balleseros salute one another

PEDERSON (CONTD)
Sorry there’s no red carpet but we
didn’t know you were coming till an
hour ago We’re not really used to
having guests

FARRAGUT
Well here we are

HATAKTI
Hiroshi Hataki Roland
Pharmaceuticals

Farragut and Walker exchange a look

HATAKI (CONTD)
Both the deceased and the surviving
patient are sequestered inside
Follow me

Suddenly the helicopter starts to lift off Walker spins
concerned

PEDERSON
It’s too cold to keep the copter
stationed here Besides -

Pederson gestures to black SIGNS in several languages marking
the facility as a QUARANTINED RESEARCH AREA

PEDERSON (CONTD)
- we don’t need the pilots any more
spooked than they are already Camp
Eisenhower is just forty miles
south They can be here at a half
hours notice

All six start approaching the entrance but Jordan can’t take
her eyes off the signs

WALKER
(quietly to Farragut)
Big pharma working with the
military

Hataki thirty feet away but still overhearing her -

HATAKI
Well tell you everything inside

From Walker’s now creeped out face we seriously doubt this

INT AREA 32 INDUSTRIAL LIFT - DAY

A private glass elevator slowly moves floor by floor down the
center artery of the complex As they descend they see
SCIENTISTS moving about the facility

Our team changes into AREA 32 SCRUBS while Pederson explains

PEDERSON
One hundred and six doctors
including Hataki and me work the
two hundred and fourteen thousand
square foot complex On top of the
research we handle all cooking
cleaning and facility maintenance
Think of us like a space ship But
with way better technology

Jordan appears slightly uncomfortable changing out in the
open

PEDERSON (CONTD)
Relax it’s one way glass
(then)
It’s important for you to keep a
low profile Our research and the
way we conduct ourselves has
political implications

WALKER
How What is this place

Hataki starts to answer while Pederson pulls out a tray with
four DEX SYRINGES Farragut Walker and Jordan immediately
inject themselves Balleseros just stares at the needle

HATAKT
We’re a research lab Just like you
were told A place for the private
and public sectors to come together
across countries to create new
partnerships

As they descend further and further the number of scientists
radically thins out replaced by COMPUTER MAINFRAMES then
HEAVY SEALED DOORS Doors that are impossible to see past

HATAKI (CONTD)
I’ve been overseeing Area 32s
research since it’s inception in
hopes of piggy backing on anything
that has commercial applications
Needless to say it’s an extremely
delicate operation all the more
reason we need you to -

FARRAGUT

We got it But right now we’re
wasting time

(to Balleseros)
You stay with Colonel Pederson I
want to see a vector map of every
possible transmission route
including the ventilation ducts -

PEDERSON
(stern)
Theyre UV filtered And besides
it’s not airborne We know this
from the infection rate

Farragut gives Balleseros a quick look - but doesn’t argue

FARRAGUT

Walker you work with Hataki to
construct a list of all possible
human carriers and begin interviews
to assess transmission mechanisms
andor commonalities among current
or future carriers If this thing
can spread person to person I want
to know how and who’s most at risk

WALKER
I should be in the disection room
With you

FARRAGUT

(to Jordan)
You’1l be assisting me with the
initial autopsy of the deceased

(to group)
No one talks to the surviving index
patient until we have a better idea
of what we’re dealing with We’1l
meet outside the slammer in one
hour

Everyone nods if Walker reluctantly And then all three
turn to Balleseros who still hasn’t injected himself

JORDAN
It’s to help with the thin air

But Balleseros just stares It’s unclear whether he’s scared
of needles or just wary in general Walker takes note again

BALLESEROS
Ill be fine

And then with a hiss the elevator stops

FARRAGUT
Remember people this thing is hot
Your small mistakes can kill you
Your even smaller mistakes can kill
all of us
(then to Pederson)
Now show me the body

INT DISECTION ROOM - DAY

Farragut stands across from Jordan both in Racal suits
Between them on the table is a non-porous BLUE BODY BAG

Both prepare their equipment Farragut two decades of
experience does it blindly He can’t stop staring at the
sack There’s a hint of sadness in his face - it is his
brother - but only a hint He’s the consummate professional

Jordan despite years of study is slightly nervous now that
she’s actually on a site She tries to hide it but Farragut
knows nothing can prepare you for this kind of experience

FARRAGUT
You ever seen a bag like this

JORDAN
I know what it is sir
FARRAGUT
It’s reverse engineered to prevent
any contamination in or out

JORDAN
I know what it is sir

Farragut smiles fastens a needle onto a syringe rechecks
his gloves He sees Jordan’s arms begin to ever so slightly

shake Keeps lecturing -

FARRAGUT
Your hands are the most vulnerable
part of this kind of work Over
twelve thousand health workers are
infected annually this way

Jordan looks up Says nothing

FARRAGUT (CONTD)
The second greatest vulnerability
is claustrophobia induced by the
head gear If you feel light
headed excuse yourself but under
no circumstance remove the mask -

JORDAN
Sir

FARRAGUT
- or you might find yourself in the
same condition as the thing you’re
working on

Farragut still hasn’t taken his eyes off the bag

JORDAN
Dr Farragut Would you like to do
this alone

Farragut stares up at Jordan

FARRAGUT
I’m just trying to prepare you
First time in the field can be
hard

JORDAN
I’m prepared sir My father’s been
talking about this kind of stuff
since I was in diapers

FARRAGUT
Right Now open the bag

Jordan reaches over and unzips -
SHOT FROM BELOW

Jordan looks down into the bag and her EYES GROW LARGE She
turns pale sputters VOMIT into the front of her mask and
backs away

Farragut smiles sympathetically then turns down towards the
bag himself But what he sees hits him even harder He
shakes

FARRAGUT (CONT’D)
You should go Sarah

SARAH
But —

FARRAGUT
I’ll leave the samples outside for
you
(then)
Now please

Sarah does so reluctantly and he goes back to staring His
face says it all - even he wasn’t ready for this
Scientifically or emotionally

FARRAGUT (CONTD)
I’m so sorry Paul So sorry

He takes a breath Then another Then another Slowly
recomposing himself Then slowly painfully he begins to
work

But then he sees something Something he’s never seen
before And his face darkens

FARRAGUT (CONT’D)
Dear God

Then probing even further

FARRAGUT (CONT’D)
Dear God

CUT TO BLACK

ACT II

INT MASTER CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Doubling as Pederson’s office - it’s plain Mostly filled
with diagrams computer monitors and a couple ping pong
paddles in the corner

Balleseros looks over STAGING MAPS and we now get a grasp of
how incredibly layered the facility is Almost like a
labyrinth

PEDERSON
Eighty six self contained research
labs Forty three miles of sewer
lines One hundred eighteen miles
of subterranean ducts

Balleseros not much of talker takes notes But his eyes
never leave Pederson for more than a second

PEDERSON (CONTD)
How many years you been with the
service

BALLESEROS
Nine First six doing anthrax
detection in Iraq Last three as a
structural engineer stateside

PEDERSON
So you’re not a doctor This shit
must seem crazy to you

BALLESEROS
Not really

PEDERSON
You Mexican We have some
scientists from Guadala -

BALLESEROS
I grew up on an army base in
Michigan I was adopted

That kills that conversation Balleseros points to the map

BALLESEROS (CONTD)
What’s this here
PEDERSON
That room’s been redesigned in the
past six months Emergency exit
used to lead straight out It’s
been sealed for security reasons
(off Balleseros’s look)
Bears and shit

Ballerseros lets it go For now They go back to the map

BALLESEROS
And these hallways

PEDERSON
All negative air pressure The
facility was exactingly built to
prevent cross contamination -

And here’s where we switch to 3D CSI MODE We now see the
entire facility transparent from above And from above it

looks very different and ten times as big

PEDERSON (0C) (CONTD)
As you saw individuals pass freely
throughout Level One or Living
Zones —

The LEVEL ONE zones light up ORANGE We see simulated people
think The Sims moving through those areas talking eating -

PEDERSON (0C) (CONT’D)
- but are forced to detox
themselves in decontamination
chambers before and after passing
into a Level Two or Work Zone -

These ZONES light up BLUE Movement is orderly and spaced

out almost like a conveyor belt

PEDERSON (0C) (CONTD)
Eighty percent of our personnel
conduct their projects in Level Two
zones making it the largest area
for possible cross contamination
Certain experiments with
unpredictable or unstable by-
products call for scientists to
work in Level Three Zones -

These ZONES significantly smaller light up in RED Movement
is sparse restricted and staccato This is what we didn’t

see behind those doors

PEDERSON (0C) (CONTD)
- which is where you’1l be spending
most of your time here These areas
are subject to regular ultraviolet
eradication with neither staff nor
equipment leaving without redundant
tox screens

BALLESEROS (0C)
No level Four

PEDERSON (0C)
No

The discerning viewer will remember this contradicts what we
saw in the teaser

BALLESEROS (0C)
Air supply and disposal

PEDERSON (0C)
Class R

We ZOOM in on a MAN COUGHING

PEDERSON (CONTD)
In a normal building a pathogen can
roam freely throughout a
ventilation system -

We follow a VIRUS moving throughout the entire facility
dodging and weaving like a boy in a water slide going from
room to room person to person -

PEDERSON (0C) (CONTD)
But our system filters out all bugs
known to earth in the duct joints -

Literally THOUSANDS of ULTRAVIOLET DUCT FILTERS light up
throughout the map KILLING virus particles as they pass by -

PEDERSON (0C) (CONTD)
- and disposes any chemical by-
product into a discharge tank
outside of the facility -

We see remnants pass up and out through additional ducts get
eradicated and burned again then get pushed out of the
building into a large quadruple reinforced STEEL TANK held at
one thousand degrees below zero

PEDERSON (0C) (CONTD)
- where if by some miracle of God
something still lived it would
freeze to death immediately In or
outside the tank

BACK TO THE
ENGINE ROOM -

Pederson looks pleased with himself

PEDERSON (CONTD)
Another advantage of working up
here

BALLESEROS
Id like to see this exit duct

PEDERSON
Of course you would

The two men stand up start to exit

PEDERSON (CONTD)
It’s nice to be working with
another military man on this You
and me we think the same

Off Balleseros face we’re not so sure

INT HATAKI’S OFFICE - DAY

Sleek Large The few visible items are expensive Along the
glass table - PHOTOGRAPHS of all STAFF including
nationalities detailed MANIFEST SCHEDULES and specialities

Hataki watches Walker pick through them

WALKER
Men mostly

HATAKI
Intentional Gender uniformity
leads to less sexual interaction

The irony of this isn’t lost on Walker or Hataki

WALKER
(sarcastic)
You don’t want little arctic babies
roaming the halls This place could
live on forever

Hataki stares back deadpan - as if she doesn’t understand the
import of what she just said

HATAKTI
It was an American idea
(then brushing over it)
I expected your team would want to
meet with the infected survivor
first Isn’t that standard

WALKER

(continuing to work)
Suspected infectees will say
whatever it takes to get them out
of confinement Better to go in
with a theory than let them form
one for you

(then)
Farragut has his process We’ve had
good success with it in the past

Walker lifts a photo makes a notation

WALKER (CONTD)
(smiling)
Besides you guys already asked him
the obvious questions Right

It sounds rhetorical but something about the way Walker
asks it’s like she’s always probing - but with a smile
Hataki too smart for games doesn’t respond

HATAKI
So you’ve worked with Farragut
before

WALKER
With Under Around We’re friends
too

She consults her chart again

WALKER (CONT’D)
Our dead patient worked in the
infectious disease unit Our
surviving patient Mark Ligoria in
the aerosol group How often do
staff from these departments
interact

HATAKI
Almost never Break times are
designed to inhibit interaction
during the work day

(MORE)

HATAKI (CONTD)
No one needs to know what anyone
outside their group is working on

WALKER
Except you and Pederson
(re-checking the schedule)
What about the vaccine group How
mobile are -

HATAKTI
You don’t think we’ve considered
baton theory

Walker stops for a half second - she was thinking that - but
doesn’t give him the immediate satisfaction

WALKER
I think it’s clear from the
manifest schedules that a pathogen
would have had ample opportunity to
spread via -

Back to CSI MODE

It’s a more simple version of the overhead map we saw before
except now Simulated People are milling about the entire
facility

WALKER (0S) (CONTD)
- a baton like method

We see one Doctor with a BATON which he passes like a virus
to another Doctor walking perpendicular across him After
each pass the Baton starts to immediately fade until it’s
passed again

This keeps happening moving the Baton before it can die
across the entire facility in a matter of seconds Truly
infecting no one except the FINAL CARRIER

BACK TO OFFICE -

HATAKTI
Except as we’ve said it’s not
airborne We’re certain because we
remove the air carrier mechanism
from all of our cultures So unless
youre suggesting all these ‘baton
passers’ kissed each other in
passing the likelihood of a fomite
method of transmission seems
negligible It’s a theory
predicated on the idea that we’re
being careless or underhanded

(MORE)
HATAKI (CONTD)
(then)
I gather you’ve come into this with
a anti-corporate bias

WALKER
Have you found anything to sell

HATAKT
No But that’s the thing we have
money for decades So I can be
patient The military wouldn’t have
known what to do with microwaves if we
hadn’t shown them the frozen pizza

Hataki smiles There’s something oddly charming about the

man he certainly seems to believe his own words

WALKER
So you’re making better
microwavesThank God

HATAKI
God has no say in what we’re doing

Hataki sees her face playfully laughs it off He then
gestures to a window overlooking one of the factory floors
DOCTORS mill about - moving test tubes calibrating machines

Next Hataki beckons to an opposite smaller window which

overlooks the very empty Arctic tundra

HATAKI (CONTD)
The best thing about this part of
the world - no press no
politicians no distractions That
almost justifies the expenditure in
itself

WALKER
For years no one’s visited or left
the base And then three days ago
theBrazilians

HATAKI
Most of our investors never make
the trek up here But certain
parties invested particularly
heavily They were curious and we
complied

WALKER
Complied with what What did they
want to see

Hataki shifts in his seat

HATAKI
Evidence that we existed and that
their money was going to good use

Then nipping it in the bud before she can follow up -

HATAKI (CONTD)
Our position on travel is a safety
issue surely one that the CDC
tries to employ as well Kate

Walker pleasant despite the use of her first name smiles
back holds up six photos from the pile led by one of DR
YEMI BABINGTON (black late 40’s)

WALKER
Paul Farragut our patient zero
had the highest probability of
interaction with these six who
could have formed a human viral
chain to Ligoria Quarantine them
and prepare them for questioning

She drops the photos and exits

INT FARRAGUT’S BROTHER’S ROOM - DAY

Our Farragut enters stands there silently It’s an empty
dorm with a few shirts hanging in the closet a pair of
shoes under the bed but otherwise empty

Farragut walks over to his brother’s desk If he’s having an
emotional reaction he’s hiding it It could be a strangers
room

He opens the drawer A few PENS a SCREWDRIVER and a
NOTEBOOK Farragut flips through the first few pages - random
notes scribbles He shuts the drawer

He moves over to the bed sits down Looks underneath -
nothing Opens the night stand At the bottom of it -

A PHOTO of his BROTHER (then 12) with his PARENTS all making
a cake Farragut stares at the photo and for the first time
he looks affected But not half as affected as when -

He looks up and sees ANOTHER PHOTO FRAMED by the
headboard It’s of his BROTHER and HIMSELF FISHING

Farragut picks it up and stares This from a guy he hasn’t
spoken to in two decades It makes no sense And weirder
still -

Why would he put a photo of their parents in a drawer and a
framed picture of Farragut out on top

Farragut looks even closer It’s not clear he even remembers
this photo Farragut inspects the edges of the frame and
that’s when he discovers

Theyre loose Farragut picks at them with his fingernails
He goes back to the drawer takes out the screwdriver And
like the surgeon he is he delicately pries the frame open
pulls out the photo to see -

Bizarre WRITING on the back Almost like it’s some kind of
made up language Or code

Farragut runs back to the drawer pulls out the notebook He
turns through the pages faster and faster until - ALL THE
PAGES are written in this code

HUNDRED OF PAGES

And then in the middle of it all ONE single line written in
plain text -

THE HELIX PROJECT

A NOISE from behind him Farragut drops the picture frame
SHATTERING it spins and sees -

Walker standing there staring at him She walks over sees
the photo right side up covered in glass

WALKER
You okay

FARRAGUT
I

But Walker isn’t looking for an explanation She’s never seen
his this vulnerable

WALKER
You want a minute

FARRAGUT
You don’t understand

WALKER
If it was my brother I’d want a -

FARRAGUT
It was my brother who called us

Both stare at each other confused

WALKER
How is that possible

FARRAGUT
I don’t know

WALKER

Why wouldn’t he call you directly
FARRAGUT

We’re not friends We’re not

anything
She picks up the photo of the two boys

WALKER
Well this picture suggests
otherwise
(then)
And right now so does your face

Farragut turns sees his face in the mirror She’s right - he
does look distraught He’s not sure how to emotionally deal
with this

WALKER (CONT’D)
Are you sure you don’t want a
minute

Farragut’s face hardens

FARRAGUT
What I want is to wrap this up by
tonight and be with my wife by
tomorrow

WALKER
Youve never backed down from a
mystery before

FARRAGUT
Tonight Walker We’re on that
plane by tonight

INT SLAMMER OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

Farragut sits at a table with Walker She clearly wants to
keep discussing the connection with the brother but one look
from Farragut’s face wards her off

WALKER
Fine
(then)
Where’s Ballerseros then

FARRAGUT
Late

WALKER
Figures

FARRAGUT
Meaning what

WALKER
Meaning we know nothing about him

FARRAGUT
He’s just doing his job And nobody
likes to inject themselves with
needles We’re the freaks

She relaxes - he’s always a step ahead of her in the
conversation

WALKER
Speaking of where is Jordan

FARRAGUT
Preparing the samples

WALKER
She do okay

FARRAGUT
Better than you your first time

WALKER
And theremains

FARRAGUT
Too early to say Based on what I
saw in the bag the virus is
foreign to anything we’ve ever seen
before Looks man made

WALKER
Big pharma messing around in the snow

FARRAGUT
Don’t read into it You know what
else is man made Tylenol People
die from over-the-counter meds all
the time He could have been sick
before he even arrived here

(then)

You find anything

WALKER
Six transmission candidates one
especially good one An African
Doctor
(then)
Why am I assigned to -

FARRAGUT
Because you’re good at coaxing
information out of men I imagine
it has something to do with the one
way nature of the attraction

Walker tries to suppress her smile

FARRAGUT (CONTD)

This stuff always has more to do
with people than pathogens You
know that These interviews are our
best chance of solving this thing

WALKER
The first one starts in an hour

FARRAGUT
Then let’s get this over with

And with that Farragut hits a switch revealing DR MARK
LIGORIA on the other side of the glass The man is catatonic
but stable He’s loosely restrained by leather bands -
reassuring given the man has the build of a professional

wrestler

and the stare of a dead man

WALKER
Look at his eyes

FARRAGUT
Disease crazy Or “crazy cause they
locked me up here and no one’s told
me anything”

Point made Farragut hits a button speaks into a microphone -

FARRAGUT (CONTD)
Dr Ligoria my name is Dr Alan
Farragut of the United States
Center for Disease Control My
colleague Dr Katherine Walker
and I have reviewed the account you
gave Dr Hataki and we have some
follow up questions If you
understand what I’m saying please
respond in the affirmative

The man lifts his eyes

FARRAGUT (CONTD)
You stated that you had zero
interaction with Dr Paul Farragut
in the week prior to noticing your
initial symptoms Is that correct

The man nods

FARRAGUT (CONTD)
And in the report you describe
those initial symptoms as minor
hallucinations feeling numb to
pain followed by slight
hemorrhaging in the gum line anda
progressive fever May I ask why
you took twelve hours to report
your condition to your superiors

The man leans forward scans the room mumbles something

FARRAGUT (CONT’D)
Could you repeat your answer

He looks around again MOUTHS something unclear towards them

WALKER
Could be dysphoria brought on by
dehydration

Farragut nods but he’s not convinced Hits the mic again

FARRAGUT
Was there any possible exposure to
unidentified elements in the days
leading up to your outbreak
Possibly a compound in transition

More mumbling Walker leans over hits the button

WALKER
Dr Ligoria You have symptoms
similar to Dr Paul Farragut from
organics but for some reason
they’re manifesting themselves
differently in you Do you have any
idea why that might be

More of the same Ligoria then leans back closes his eyes
Walker’s nonplussed

WALKER (CONTD)
A doctor with a bad attitude

FARRAGUT
Or just tired

Farragut then stares even more closely The man is still
mumbling but it almost lookscalculated Like he’s
intentionally rocking his head to avoid someone seeing

Farragut stands up looks through the glass around the room
Nothing but water bottles and an observation camera Then
the mumbling stops and dark thick saliva starts to spill
from Ligoria’s mouth

WALKER
Nothing in his indication should
cause that

More saliva The man goes limp Farragut’s curious

FARRAGUT
I’m gonna go in for samples

EXT AREA 32 BASE - DAY

Balleseros now dressed in snow gear follows Pederson along
the outside wall The place truly is a fortress with no
views inside save the evenly spaced three-inch metallic glass
windows every ten meters

And inside those windows - long empty hallways that appear to
have been abandoned for years It makes no sense and it’s
scary as shit Balleseros turns away and looks up sees huge
CLOUDS forming but says nothing Pederson sees his face

PEDERSON
Weather here changes every few
hours It’s nothing

They keep walking Balleseros’s eyes warily alternating
between Pederson the integrity of the walls and the vast
tundra behind him The stark white landscape is disorienting

PEDERSON (CONTD)
We have a saying up here staring
is scary Keep your eyes in front
of you You get lost you’re dead
in twenty minutes

They round another corner and arrive at the EXIT DUCT As
described it leads to an enormous disease REFUSE TANK
surrounded by BARBED WIRE

BALLESEROS
Worried about thieves

PEDERSON
No one’s that stupid Damn bears

Balleseros looks again suspicious Even we think wires don’t
seem like the right kind of deterrent for twelve hundred
pound polar bears

Balleseros pulls out a METAK gauge gun and examines the duct
It’s a complicated piece of engineering but it looks fine
He moves around to examine the other side when he sees -

A COPPER TUBE two feet in diameter leading into the ground

BALLESEROS
What the hell is that

PEDERSON
Plumbing What did you think we did
with the shit

Balleseros walks closer kicks at the surface ice around the
pipe where it enters the ice pack slowly clearing a view

BALLESEROS
I thought the sewage pipe empties
into the north side Map J

Pederson’s impressed and wary of this guy’s memory

PEDERSON
Right But that’s for human waste

Balleseros gets down on his knees and scrapes away the
surface snow entirely And that’s when he sees it - through
three feet of ice the water below is BROWN

PEDERSON (CONTD)
This here’s for the monkeys

Balleseros looks up alarmed

INT DIAGNOTICS LAB - DAY

In absolute silence - Jordan remarkably calm as she’s back
to doing what she does best carefully places samples into
petri dishes with a quartz eye dropper

The work is tedious and beautiful with little explosions of
light erupting each time two mixtures collide And there’s a
rhythm to the work like playing the drums Except these drums
could explode and kill you And everyone you know

She finishes the final dish in the row lifts the tray and
begins to walk toward the STEEL OBSERVATION CABINET when -

VOICE (VO)
How are things going

Jordan spins sees Dr Hataki behind her Takes a breath

JORDAN
Good sir We should have a better
idea in six hours

HATAKT
Four That processor accelerates
the growth mechanism by thirty
percent

Jordans never heard of such a thing

HATAKI (CONTD)

We developed and built it here
using tri-polar magnetism It
forces the cells to divide quicker
by literally ripping them apart

JORDAN
Is thatsafe

HATAKT

We were actually looking for a way
to slow down the process This was

a necessary step in getting there

(off Jordan’s uncertainty)

Relax We used to develop and test
things like this in space all the
time But there’s no political will
for that kind of research anymore

Jordan’s still not sure what kind of research he means But
before she can ask -
HATAKI (CONT’‘D)
We wanted to save mankind too we

just didn’t have the tools yet

Jordan wants to smile this is exciting for her But

JORDAN
Sir should you be in here
Protocol -

HATAKT

Sorry I’m not a government man
myself and well you can hardly
blame me for being curious I’11l
get out of your way

But rather than move Hataki just stands there watching
Jordan who can feel Hataki’s stare over her shoulder

Finally Hataki walks back by the culture cabinets hovers
for another few seconds with his back to us and exits

Jordan now disquieted by the encounter and slightly nervous
again goes back to her work inserting a long needle into
the sample sack -

MATCH CUT TO

INT SLAMMER - DAY

Farragut pulls a LONG SYRINGE out of a stocked TOOL KIT We
pull back - see Farragut in a full RACAL suit standing five
feet from Dr Ligoria who’s back to murmering incoherently

From up close Farragut sees the man’s sweat It’s almost
black Black sweat Farragut speaks to Walker through his mic -

FARRAGUT
Giving subject ten cc’s of
anesthesia to faciltate the
extraction process

- then inserts the syringe into the left side of the man’s
lower spinal cord Ligoria calms down goes limp again

FARRAGUT (CONTD)
Pulling five cc’s from the spleen
to test for lymphatic infection

Farragut pulls out another thinner syringe and expertly
inserts it into the man’s side The chamber behind the needle
slowly fills with milky fluid Farragut begins to pack up
takes another look at the fluid and frowns

FARRAGUT (CONTD)
Pulling a redundant sample directly
from the lower jaw

Farragut leans in towards the man’s head Unlike the rest of
Ligoria’s body - which is strangely as smooth as a teenagers -
his face does appear affected The lines around his eyes are
too deep For a man of any age

Farragut pulls out a new syringe starts to insert it below
the jaw when -

Ligoria’s eyes flash open He lunges for the needle with one
hand and grabs Farragut’s neck with the other Walker
scrambles at the window -

WALKER
Oh God Shit

Farragut keeps wrestling with him blood now trickling out of
Ligoria’s neck

FARRAGUT
Let go Let go

But Ligoria’s not letting go Instead he’s turning
Farragut’s head AWAY from the security camera

WALKER
Requesting permission to use
sedation gas

From Farragut’s POV - the men’s faces are inches apart
Farragut is hampered by the suit but Ligoria is equally
hampered by the arm restraints and anesthetic

LIGORIA
(Italian accent)
It’s in the cage

FARRAGUT
Calm down Let go

Farragut desperately tries to hold onto the needle - the TIP
is less than a CENTIMETER from his own NECK - while not
poking and infecting himself

Ligoria pulls harder and the men TWIST the needle now hidden
somewhere amongst their contorted bodies Balleseros charges
into the observation room Sees what’s happening

BALLESEROS
What the -

WALKER
(intercom to Farragut)
Again permission to use gas

But Farragut still scrambling to control the needle shakes
his head no

BALLESEROS
Do it anyway

WALKER
But Ligoria’s our best lead

Balleseros pushes past Walker towards the control panel
BALLESEROS
Over-riding internal chain of command
Will trigger gas in five four -
BACK ON LIGORIA AND FARRAGUT
Were right in their faces
LIGORIA
(whispering)
I never wanted to live like this
It’s too much They’1ll try and tell
you I’m crazy -
Farragut looks into the man’s eyes He looks exactly that

BACK ON WALKER

Who’s debating whether to stop Balleseros Two panels in the
ceiling open two gas mains drop ready to go

BACK ON LIGORIA

LIGORIA (CONTD)
The cages -

BALLESEROS
Initiating -

FARRAGUT
(to Walker)
Wait It will kill him Our only
lead
LIGORIA

(whispering frantically)
The little men The zool

FARRAGUT
(to Ligoria)
That doesn’t make sense -

LIGORIA
I knew you wouldn’t believe -

Ligoria takes control of the needle but Farragut turns him
over and shoves his neck into the corner of the operating
table Blood shoots faster from Ligoria’s cut He groans

Farragut cracks Ligoria’s wrist sideways takes the needle
back and falls backward out of his reach just as Walker
hits the emergency shut off valve

WALKER
Get out of there now

Farragut dripping in sweat backs out of the room and
collapses

INT SLAMMER DECONTAMINATION HALLWAY - DAY

Farragut now de-suited enters the room Walker Jordan and
Balleseros wait Farragut removes tools from his kit and
places them in defined slots along the wall as they speak

WALKER
What the hell happened

FARRAGUT
The suit’s intact I’m fine

WALKER
But what happened The anesthesia
should have -

FARRAGUT
Slow metastic process Might be why
he’s still alive Samples should
confirm that

WALKER
Wait You got the samples

FARRAGUT
They’re off to the lab as we speak

Smiles all around

FARRAGUT (CONTD)
(to Jordan)
You okay running tissue cultures on
Ligoria

JORDAN
(almost defensive)
Of course

FARRAGUT
(to Balleseros)
And can we trust the integrity of
the delivery mechanism inside this
building

BALLESEROS
Actually that’s why I came back
early We can’t trust anything
They’re using Monobos as test
subjects

JORDAN
So

FARRAGUT
The ‘so’ is why didn’t they tell us

WALKER
They think it’s non-relevant How
Many are we talking

BALLESEROS
I don’t know
(pausing)
But it’s intentionally mismarked on
the maps as a fuel center And the
room’s been redesigned In the past
two weeks

Complete silence - this is no oversight Something clicks on
Farragut’s face He glances back towards Ligoria - what was
it he said Another frown

Farragut keeps placing tools along the wall until he realizes
one is missing From the wall it looks like it would have
been some kind of tiny bone saw He checks his kit again

It’s empty

FARRAGUT
Shit Go check on -

Farragut and Company run -

INT SLAMMER OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
Ligoria’s gone And from the ceiling a PANEL’S MISSING
He’s escaped You gotta be fucking kidding me

CUT TO BLACK
ACT III

INT HALLWAY - DAY

Our team Pederson and Hataki scramble down a corridor

PEDERSON
How could you leave him in there
with a bone saw

WALKER
The man attacked and stole it from
his kit We couldn’t even see -

PEDERSON
Is it not protocol in the CDC to
check your inventory before leaving
an area

Point made But Farragut’s mind is elsewhere
FARRAGUT
How could a man break out of a
slammer with just a saw And it was
a fifteen foot jump to the ceiling

This hits everyone It does seem impossible

PEDERSON
I don’t know Farragut perhaps
he’s just smarter than us But
well never know for sure because
he sawed off the room’s security
camera before exiting

Hataki stops in front of a locker pulls out a key opens

and removes a local OVERHEAD MAP

HATAKI
(calming them down)
What matters is we find him
Navigating the ducts is almost
impossible with a map and
equipment

PEDERSON
Not to mention a healthy dose of
sanity

Hataki shoots Pederson a look Farragut catches

it

it

HATAKI
(nipping it in the bud)
Ligoria was an aggressive scientist
prone towards risk taking But all
the great ones are You’d agree to
that wouldn’t you Dr Farragut

Another shot and it lands What does Hataki know But there’s
no time for that now Hataki’s finger stops at a point on the
map right below a BLUE DUCT

HATAKI (CONT’‘D)
Without oxygen supplementation he
couldn’t have made it further than
here
(then to Pederson)
Do it

Pederson showing his first sign of hesitation since we’ve
met him grits his teeth then reaches into that same locker
which we now see has a large EMERGENCY CONTROL BUTTON

FARRAGUT
Wait What are you -

But it’s too late Pederson hits the button and immediately
overhead the sound of SCREECHING Like a jet engine

PEDERSON
(over the roar)
Flooded it with phosgene oxime If
he wasn’t dead before he sure as
hell is now

Slowly the screeching winds down Our team stands in shock
Finally -

WALKER
I’1l go get him

PEDERSON
No you won’t That stuff could
kill an elephant It’1ll take three
hours for the oxime to clear out
Well get him then but right now
we have other problems

BALLESEROS
Like the monkeys

Silence again But Hataki’s prepared -

HATAKT

We should have mentioned them but
we didn’t because as of now we’ve
never actually used them The
monkeys are to test compounds
before they enter a human space
but neither of our infectees had
any contact with them and as your
man here discovered they are on a
completely separate eco maintenance
system Hence zero interaction

FARRAGUT
Id like to see them anyway

Hataki and Pederson exchange a look

HATAKT
Why

INT HALLWAY - DAY

Walker and Jordan walk towards the east wing Walker’s
pensive This is also the first time the two women have been
alone together There’s tension Experience versus new blood

JORDAN
You don’t actually think this could
be a retrovirus

WALKER
The presence of monkeys makes it
more likely than ever Retroviruses
love to jump species

Jordan’s not on board

WALKER (CONTD)

Look you didn’t see Ligoria His
eyes were empty His body mechanics
marred You ever seen what a
retrovirus does to a central
nervous system

JORDAN
I may have seen just that two hours
ago But it’s hardly concrete
evidence of a -

WALKER
True For that we’d also need to
see it hijacking healthy DNA Which
is why you need to work faster

But Jordan’s not buying it - Walker’s explanation or the idea
that Jordan’s somehow slowing them down

JORDAN
You’re seeing what you want to see
Things die In fact everything
dies Doesn’t mean it’s a
conspiracy

Walker looks the girl over - is she seriously lecturing to
her They come to a fork in their path

WALKER
Your first cultures should be ready
in ten You should go

Jordan stares at her then storms off

INT SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

Walker sits in small room going over surveillance footage
preparing for her first interview Splayed across the table
are photos of the six possible human carriers from earlier
But right in front of her is -

Yemi Babington the same African doctor featured earlier
He’s also the doctor Walker’s currently watching on black and
white footage taken a week before

In it the conservatively dressed doctor walks quickly down a
narrow hallway which would be unremarkable except that the
man STOPS every two or three seconds to look beside him
Which makes no sense because -

The entire hallway is sealed And empty

Walker stops the footage rewinds it plays it again Then
another time What the hell is he looking at

She pauses it ZOOMS in on his face Is he crazy paranoid
tired or just

A THUD from above Walker She looks up startled as her
headphones fall from her ears

What the fuck was that
She waits for it to come again butnothing Exhausted

herself Walker puts her headphones back on starts a new
video

But then from above her the tiny sound of banging Walker
takes off her headphones looks up -

HARD CUT TO

FARRAGUT (0C)
Can you stop banging on that

Pull back to reveal -

INT SIMIAN CONTAINMENT FACILITY - DAY

Farragut and Balleseros in SEMI-PROTECTIVE HAZMAT SUITS
walk through stacks of screeching hideous MONKEYS The room
is beyond enormous - with rows so long they fade into a blur

Farragut stares at the animals while Balleseros checks a cage
by tapping it with a wrench

BALLESEROS
I guess we found our ‘bears’

FARRAGUT
West African Monobos More
expensive because they’re harder to
catch Harder to catch because
they’re smarter They’re also
markedly less interested in sex
than their counterparts

Balleseros nods unconsciously touches his mouth

FARRAGUT (CONT’D)
You need a cigarette or something

Balleseros is surprised he noticed the tick

BALLESEROS
I’m quitting You quitting
(then)
Takes a smoker to know one

FARRAGUT
Yet another thing I’ve forced my
wife to suffer through Sailing
smoking and sc -

BALLESEROS
Sex

FARRAGUT
I was going to say science
(then)
All four I suppose

Both men smile at the quiet moment of comic relief and the
subject is dropped They keep walking

FARRAGUT (CONT’D)
I’m not really used to having a
chaperone Why are you here

BALLESEROS
I’m checking the design specs

FARRAGUT
I mean here here Why were you sent
here with us

Balleseros stops stares at Farragut through the cages He
starts to give a rehearsed line then changes his mind

BALLESEROS
I’m not sure
(then)
Yet

And with this one line Balleseros strangely enough might
be the only other man in the facility Farragut trusts
Farragut then leans in towards a cage takes a monkey’s hand
and rotates it back and forth It looks fine

BALLESEROS (CONTD)
I’m gonna go check the other wing
You gonna be okay without
mysupervision

Balleseros smiles walks off Farragut moves on to the next
monkey
INT LAB — DAY
Jordan removes another culture from a tray examines it
through a ELECTRON MICROSCOPE records her observations in a
MIC -
JORDAN
Sample 9t shows normal cellular

division and growth

Jordan carefully puts it back pulls out the next sample

JORDAN (CONTD)
Sample 10t again normal butno
signs of cross-reactivity The
host’s immune system had no idea
what to do with it strongly
suggesting an artificial compound -

Jordan more excited now puts it back and pulls out another -

JORDAN (CONTD)
Sample 11t shows more division
Exceptit’s flawed

Jordan stands up alarmed

JORDAN (CONTD)
It’s as if it was designed to
retard cell death but poorly
designed Allowing for too many
internal mutations
(almost to herself)
But why

Jordan goes to find the 12th tray when - she realizes it’s
missing She searches the outlining trays confused

She starts going through the surrounding cases the same that
Hataki was hovering over earlier Starts to panic Losing shit
is not okay in this kind of work And on her first assignment

JORDAN (CONT’D)
No No

Jordan spins looking everywhere when - she catches the side
of her right containment suit on the edge of one of the
cabinets opening a very tiny RIP

But she’s too frantic to notice She goes back to the
shelves still looking

EXT SURVELLIANCE ROOM - DAY
Walker slowly enters the hallway looking up down

everywhere She takes a left moving slowly waiting for the
noise again

But the slower she walks the longer the hallway starts to
seem and the softer she moves the quieter Impossibly long
Impossibly silent

This is her first time moving alone through the complex And
alone this place is a hundred times creepier

Walker looks behind her again Nothing Above her Nothing
Below her - her own feet on the oddly dim floor And then -

A STRANGE SHADOW FROM ABOVE She starts up begins to SWING
her arm defensively when -

She sees Farragut Standing there with a note pad Silent
FARRAGUT
I guess we’re both scaring each
other today

He sees her balled up fist ready to strike and smiles

FARRAGUT (CONTD)
Everything okay

Walker catches her breath shakes her head yes

Above them in the FAR distance the ever so slight sound of
the beginning of a THUNDER STORM

FARRAGUT (CONTD)
Good Because Jordan’s found
something

INT LABORATORY - DAY

BLACK through a MICROSCOPE -

JORDAN (0C)
This is it at 100xp

The lens OPENS CLOSE UP of a TISSUE SLIDE Pink Bushy

JORDAN (0C) (CONTD)
And this is it at 10000xp Note
the telomeres at the ends

PUSH IN a hundred times closer on ONE CELL The ends are
frayed like bunches of WIRES - not that different than the
split ends of a human hair Except more radiant And twisted

WALKER (0C)
Let’s just tray three trays
forward

The same cell but this time it looks stuffed with writhing
little spaghetti threads Filling like a water balloon -

JORDAN (0C)
These cells are dying way too fast

WALKER (0C)
And the remaining ones are copying
themselves far too rapidly

(then)
It goes against everything we know
about disease pathology

They skip three trays forward again More fraying Another
CLAP of thunder from the sky as the storm continues to form

FARRAGUT (0C)
That’s because it’s a man made
retrovirus

WALKER (0C)
Three more

Now the ends are completely frayed and the cell looks to be
on the verge of exploding

WALKER (0C) (CONT’D)
Dear God It’s mutating faster
thananything I’ve ever seen I
don’t understand how they got it to
do this -

JORDAN (0S)
Magneticism

BACK ON OUR TEAM

WALKER
What

JORDAN
Hataki told me they’d created a
device that increased the rate of
cellular division by -

WALKER
Told you Told you when

JORDAN
In the lab

WALKER
(can’t believe it)
Why was Hataki in the lab with you

Silence Jordan’s embarrassed because she knows Walker’s
right

FARRAGUT
Anything else happen in there we
should know about

Silence Jordan tries to recover -

JORDAN
I should have Ligoria’s blood ready
within the hour We can use it to
compare —

But the mention of Ligoria sets off a different alarm in
Walker’s head

WALKER
Wait a second Ligoria’s still up
there We can’t have him bleeding
out all over -

Farragut instantly knows where she’s going with this
FARRAGUT
Don’t even think about it It’s too

dangerous

WALKER
It’s a goddam retrovirus

The two stare eachother down But finally with this mountain
of evidence mounting Farragut gives in

Theyre done fucking around

FARRAGUT
Do it
(then)
I need to call my wife We’re not
going anywhere

INT AREA 32 INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH BASE - NIGHT

The sounds of the storm are growing

Scientists move about taking precautions to secure the
structure There’s an orderly way to their movements but
this storm feels anything but normal Lamps swing Floors
rumble

And in the midst of it -

Farragut runs looking for a phone He stops someone -

FARRAGUT
I need a line out

But the SCIENTIST brushes him off keeps moving his cart into
a steel cabinet

Farragut tries again with someone else but again no
response These people are in the middle of a well rehearsed
drill and they seem to be immune from distractions

FARRAGUT (CONTD)
(Louder )
I need a line out I needa -

Farragut grabs a larger scientist who stares right back As
it’s an international base - it’s not even clear whether half
of them speak English

Farragut turns another corner sees a -

SATPHONE built into a wall He grabs it tries to dial out
NOTHING Tries again Nothing Tries again when -

Pederson grabs him by the arm turns him around Farragut
throws him off

PEDERSON
Just what are you trying to -

FARRAGUT
I’m calling my wife I’m telling
her were staying

Pederson’s face flashes from concern to anger and finally
to amusement

PEDERSON
Stay as long as you want friend
But communications for the whole
base are down You aren’t calling
anyone

INT MONKEY CONTAINMENT WING - DAY

Balleseros’s eyes move from monkey to monkey scanning them
Theyre remarkably even scarily human But again they look
fine He marks his clipboard for each one he passes

He looks down the long aisle way there’s at least fifty just
in this column But it doesn’t faze him Balleseros keeps
working his way down the line

Hands feet eyes mouth That’s the order to scan for
disease and that’s the order he does it in It’s methodical
And boring

Ballerseros comes to the end of the row starts to turn
towards the next when - he hears MONKEY SQUEAKING behind him

Lots of it He debates whether to skip to that section
decides against it Starts with the row in front of him

Hands feet eyes mouth Hands feet eyes mouth Hands -

More SQUEAKING It’s deafening Balleseros starts to ignore
it again but can’t He turns around and heads towards that
section but instead of finding monkeys he finds

EMPTY CAGES All of them Confused Balleseros walks closer
Examines the cages They’re all closed locked clean Except

When he looks even closer some of the locks have
beenswitched This would be lost on most of us but
Balleseros is a structural engineer He turns them over and
now he’s sure of it

He sees SCRATCHING on the rear of the next cage Rust
everywhere He looks closer - these cages lookincredibly
old Wildly old He keeps moving

A newly painted ceiling on the next one New walls on the
following one They’ve all been repaired And they been
repaired to look like they’ve never been broken

Ballerseros stands up What the hell happened here The
squeaking returns Balleseros runs over and sees ONE MONOBO
still remains

Balleseros approaches it The monkey stops screaming stares
back then squeaks out a few softer sounds Almost like it’s
trying tocommunicate

Balleseros just stares It’s like looking into the face of a
child And this child is scared Ballerseros checks the
Hands Normal Feet Normal Eyes Scared butnormal
Mouth -

The monkey doesn’t want to open it’s mouth Balleseros pulls
out a CRANK TOOL uses it to grab the animal’s jaw and
forces it open Revealing -

It’s gums are FALLING APART BLACK BLOOD and DROOL spill out
everywhere Balleseros stumbles back -

BALLESEROS
Jesus Christ

- then calms down Stares at the monkey who smiles back
morosely A blood smile But weirder still - it’s TEETH are
incredibly long androtting As if it’s been alive for

The monkey then points towards another WALL and makes a
rough lifting movement with it’s arms Balleseros stands up
sees the wall Goes over Examines it

It’s a false wall designed not to attract attention It’s
also the new wall Balleseros saw on the map in the beginning
Balleseros checks his surroundings and pulls it up

INT ANOTHER HALLWAY - DAY

Balleseros walks down the hallway Unlike the rest of the
base this part feels abused As if it was recently trashed

Ballereros comes to the end sees a door Not an electronic
sealed door but an older one with a lever and steel crank
shaft Balleseros takes a deep breath and turns the wheel

The door opens -

EXT AREA 32 INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH BASE - DAY

He’s outside The storm is getting crazier and crazier He
can barely breath But then he sees it -

Literally THOUSANDS of MONKEYS as far as the EYE CAN SEE
FROZEN in the snow Caught in the act ofescaping

Ballerseros falls to his knees He’s never seen anything like
it We’ve never seen anything like it These animals were
RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES

Balleseros turns to his left sees -

Hataki in full outdoor gear staring at him At this moment
Hataki doesn’t look in charge at all

BALLESEROS
Dear God
INT LAB -— DAY

Jordan continues working with the cultures while
simultaneously scanning the room

She’s not paranoid just wary Losing another tray would be a
disaster She tries to focus Catalyzes each dish with a
dropper

JORDAN
(to Mic)
Adding thoractate to tray seven W -

When Jordan sees -

A FLY buzzing about the room A fly The room is positively
pressurized It’simpossible

Jordan takes a step back follows the Fly as it buzzes
throughout the room It moves in large swooping motions
stopping here and there to rub its front legs together

Jordans confused and scared This fly could ruin the
sterility of the room But the fact that she let in a fly a
second mistake could ruin her career

She keeps watching it It’s as if the fly ismocking her
Buzzing louder and louder Too loud And thenit lands on
Jordans MASK

The two stare at each other almost daring the other one to
act The fly is making FACES at her Jordan’s starts to
sweat Is this really happening She closes her eyes and -
OPENS THEM

The buzzing is gone And so is the fly Jordan looks around
the white sterilized room No fly anywhere As if

sheimagined it all

Jordan blinks again goes back to the trays Relieved but at
the same time almost shaking

JORDAN (CONTD)
(to Mic)
Adding thoractate to tray eight -
And then a BANG from above Then another THEN ANOTHER
It sounds scarily close to what Walker heard earlier But
this time it’s way LOUDER and more distinctly likelike
someone is walking up there CIRCLING HER

Jordan freezes again Is that who took the tray First the
fly then this

Jordan shakes it off - her mind must be slipping

She just needs to stay focused -

And then she COUGHS again And this time from her mouth we
see the slightest hint of GREY mist gather on her mask

MATCH CUT TO

INT TOTAL BLACKNESS

Breathing through an oxygen mask More comes into focus

A WOMAN in a Racal suit Crawling on her stomach More focus
It’s Walker Sweating profusely

She pants as she moves checks her hands In her left the
MAP from earlier On the map marked the spot where Ligoria
is

And in her other handa DISSECTION KIT And that’s when we
realize -

Shes up in the fucking DUCTS

Walker strains to round a corner her suit barely making the
bend Another long hallway

THUNDER from above But this time it’s painfully loudWhat
kind of storm is this

She keeps moving but her movements are out of rythm with
thunder making each lunge forward more and more awkward

A CRACK of LIGHTNING causes the vents to REVERBERATE Walker
looks down at her body She’s shaking

A slight incline starts in the vents We get closer to her
face Sweat everywhere Almost fogging up the mask

It could be from fear but the grit in her teeth suggest
determination Or something even deeper

More thunder The sound of WIND whipping the building And
then the worst possible scenario -

The vent starts to NARROW She twists and turns winding her
way up the increasingly cramped space like a snake

The fact that she’s still even moving is incredible

One last corner Walker’s beyond exhausted and so is her
oxygen supply She’s breathing WAY too hard

She takes a final deep breath bends her body hears a
massive CLAP of THUNDER She contorts herself around the
final corner ready for anything Except

NOTHING

He’s fucking gone

And Walkers face - horror

CUT TO BLACK

ACT IV

EXT OVERHEAD SHOT OF THE BASE -

The MOTHER of all storms As bad as it sounded it’s a
hundred times worse Think HAIL the size of BOWLING BALLS
ICE CHUNKS the size of CARS

It’s strangely beautiful

And scary as hell

INT MAIN HALL —- DAY
Farragut and Walker charge down the hallway

FARRAGUT
You’re sure

WALKER
I searched the entire duct

FARRAGUT
If he’s alive -

WALKER
But it’s not possible Oxime
affects the cell lining the second
it passes through the skin He has
to be dead

WALKER (CONTD)
You’re not listening to me You saw
the first tissue set We may not
understand this thing but we
absolutely know it kills anything
it gets inside

Farragut stops something big has occurred to him

FARRAGUT
Youre right

WALKER
Iknow This thing rips people to
shreds -

FARRAGUT

Which means Ligoria might be
infected by something different

Silence while they both take this in

WALKER
The markup was the same -

FARRAGUT
So we do a second one Because if
he’s still alive then this thing
is something we’ve never seen
before

This hits both of them Hard Farragut turns to Walker

FARRAGUT (CONTD)
Find Babington

WALKER
He’s in quarantine

FARRAGUT

Go now We need to know how this
thing spreads and we need to know

immediately
Walker starts to run off then turns back

WALKER
And you

FARRAGUT
Me I need to go back to the goddam
microscope

INT LEVEL 1 LIVING FLOOR - NIGHT

Walker scrambles through groups of scientists trying secure
the facility as the storm escalates

She works her way down two steep set of stairs scans her ID
card and enters

INT QUARATINED AREA - NIGHT

A row a metal doors each blocking a separate room except -

They’re all OPEN Walker runs over Worse - they’re all
EMPTY

But there’s no sign of struggle It’s as if they werelet
out to help

Angry Walker runs back out into -

INT MAIN FLOOR - DAY

She weaves in and out doctors like a running back stopping
over and over to scan the facility

But because of the chaos NO ONE is where they’re supposed to
be All doors that should be closed are open All rooms that
should be full are empty

Where the hell is he

She takes a left passes through the -

INT DINING HALL - NIGHT

Plates of FOOD sit along tables abandoned by the diners now
working their stations

It feels like a ghost town She passes through the also empty
kitchen into the -
INT BOILER ROOM - NIGHT

Rows of PISTONS and WATER TANKS creak as they move up and
down Almost like a maze

Walker picks her way through it and in the distance sees -
A BLACK MAN with his back to her playing with a THERMOSTAT

She darts towards him hurdling around two boilers spins him
around

BLACK SCIENTIST
What the -

But it’s not him

WALKER
Shit

BLACK SCIENTIST
Who the hell are -

But she’s already off to -

INT DORMITORY - NIGHT

Walker runs past more empty rooms looking for Babington’s
Finally she finds it

LOOKS IN -

It’s empty Someone under the sheets Not moving
Walker whips off the sheets to see -

DIRTY LAUNDRY

She exits - keeps moving Faster and faster But where else
to look

She runs up a ladder looks over the entire floor This place
is way too big She’s starting to give up when -

She sees a communal bathroom Heads in -

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Walker scans the room - white huge bright overhead
lighting It’s rare to see a shared bathroom this empty

Eerie almost

A FAUCET runs in the distance

She walks towards it Peering around as she moves It’s so
quiet compared to what’s going on outside And with each few
feet she sees HERSELF over and over again in a different
above sink mirror

She sees her own eyes She looks rawer than ever

And fierce

She stops in front of the faucet turns it off ButWATER
is still running somewhere She scans the row of faucets All
off

She then turns sees -

BABINGTON COVERED IN BLOOD Lying DEAD under a still running
SHOWER

Walker gasps falls to her feet

She looks up A panel in the roof’s been displaced As if
someone’s climbed back up

Shaking she moves closer to the naked body It’s been
punctured in two different places And ORGANS have been
removed This can’t be happening

And then she sees it

A BONE SAW Farragut’s BONE SAW

Also covered in blood Left Like a calling card

INT APEX LABORATORY - DAY

It’s a new lab to us with high ceilings and an especially
large discharge duct in the upper corner of the room

Farragut stares down a microscope through his gas mask It’s
like he’s in love with whatever he’s looking at

ON SLIDE

We’re zoomed in at 1000000xp And what we see is - a
SIMPLE PURPLE VIRAL STRAND And yetit’s stunning

Farragut talks into a MIC -

FARRAGUT (0OS)
Six hours ago my team and I arrived
at Area 32 to explore the
possibility of a retrovirus We
found one

He keeps staring while the virus ROTATES LIKE A BALLERINA

FARRAGUT (0S) (CONT’D)
One hour ago evidence suggested
that the virus may have mutated
into two highly similar but
distinct strands Strand A appears
to be killing cells at a rate we
have never seen before I am
currently looking at Strand B

Farragut zooms in further

As we move closer it turns RED dancing FASTER AND FASTER -
twisting swirling thrusting Almost like it’sPOSSESSED

FARRAGUT (0S) (CONTD)
Strand B is distinct in that while
structurally similar to A it is
not killing the cells but rather
catalyzing them

And while ten billion of these could fit on our finger nail
it’s quickly becoming the most terrifying thing we’ve ever
seen More twisting More gyrating

FARRAGUT (CONTD)
We have evidence that Strand A was
responsible for the death of Dr
Paul Farragut and is a designer
retrovirus capable of killing a
subject within twenty four hours
Strand B meanwhile has given Dr
Mark Ligoria abnormal physical
strength in additional to some
kind of immunity to lethal toxins
Causing to him livewhen he
shouldn’t have

The thing looks fucking DEMONIC

FARRAGUT (CONTD)
Both variants of the virus are
robust and both appear to be
mutating at a radical and
unpredictable rates

Farragut takes a deep breath ZOOMS in even closer on one of
the holes From this magnification it’s huge Like the MOUTH
OF HELL -

FARRAGUT (0S) (CONTD)
And now I believe it’s mutating
again Right in front of my eyes

Faster Uglier Spinning like it’s on FIRE Perpetually
Forever

Farragut LOOKS UP -

He can’t believe it He slowly almost shaking leans back
towards his mic

FARRAGUT (CONTD)
I now have reason to believe that
Area 32 is a research facility for
experimentation in the field of
life extension Possibly
permanent extension

(then)

Which could potentially make
killing this thing

Farragut can’t believe he’s saying this

FARRAGUT (CONTD)
- next to impossible

THEN -

CUT to a POV shot from the VENT in the corner

Two EYES stare down at Farragut Two BLOOD SHOT eyes

We hear a CREAK as if it’s opening then -

HARD CUT TO

OVER BLACK -

HELIX

END PILOT
