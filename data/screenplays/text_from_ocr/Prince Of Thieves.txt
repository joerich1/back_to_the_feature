CLAIRE’S POV - THE COURSE FABRIC

We hear HEAVY BREATH RUSTLING MATERIAL SOUNDS OF TRAFFIC
We begin to see this NARROW STRIP OF LIGHT

CLAIRE (V0)
My lap against the seat

FRAWLEY (V0)
I’m assuming they warned you not to
cooperate with the police

CLAIRE (V0O) -
One of them took my driver’s license
and read it to me Said he was

FRAWLEY (V0)
In his words if you can remember

Claires legs are bare her jacket gone Her ELIMINATION
PRINTS are being taken by a MALE TECH in blue ink

CLAIRE —
“Tf you tell the FBI anything we’

The Print Tech looks up before resuming

FRAWLEY
Good thank you
(recovers - a pro)
And then what
CLAIRE
Then nothing We just drove

FRAWLEY
This was a passenger van

CLAIRE
I guess so

FRAWLEY
Youre not certain

CLAIRE
I went skiing in Vermont at
Christmas and we rented a Villager
-I only remember because we called
ourselves the Villager People It
was like that

FRAWLEY
And the one sitting next to you

BACK TO VAN (EARLIER)
Doug looking at Claire Isolated tense

CLAIRE (V0O)

THE COARSE FABRIC

We hear the van’s TIRES ON GRAVEL then DOORS OPENING Now a
GUSTING of wind overwhelmed by an approaching JETLINER

You say “helped you oat”

Claire movingexiting unsteadily into the ocean breeze

CLAIRE (V0O)
I was afraid of falling I was
afraid of everything Buthe
didn’t let me fall

FRAWLEY (V0)
Go on

CLAIRE (V0O) —

I stepped out it sounded like a
runway But it was a beach de
guided me onto the sand and told me
to walk until I felt the water on my
toes

We hear STRAINED BREATHING and UNCERTAIN STEPS in sand
CLAIRE (V0)
It was the longest walk of my life I
kept thinking I’d step off a cliff
We hear the OCEAN the sound then buried by ANOTHER JET
CLAIRE (V0)
And then I felt the water
EXT BEACH - NEAR-LOGAN AIRPORT -— MORNING
Claire removes her blindfold frothy tide lapping at her
stockinged feet She faces the horizon hair tossed by a
stiff wind - as a JETLINER STREAKS OVERHEAD -

Her face isn’t merely relieved - it’s awestruck

BACK TO BANK BREAK ROOM
Claire notices her hand shivering and can’t control it

FRAWLEY
Thats just the adrenaline fading

He drapes his jacket over her shoulders - wiping a smudge of

fingerprint ink from her cheek before sitting down
FRAWLEY
The one beside you - could you get a
sense of his size

CLATRE
Yes He was big

FRAWLEY
Big as in strong

CLATRE
As in strong tall

FRAWLEY
And he wasfriendly

Claire picks up on his implication looking away uneasy

CLAIRE
No just - not angry

She looks at her RUINED STOCKINGS bunched on the table

CLAIRE
Why did they take our shoes

FRAWLEY
To keep you from running Or
kicking Did you see Mr Bearns
activate the alarm

Close on Claire reaching for a bottle of Poland Spring
sloshes the water around inside without opening it

CLAIRE
No

Frawley picks up on her hesitance misreading it
FRAWLEY

Ms Keesey are you sure you don’t

want to go get checked out

She is sensitive to this as though accused

She

CLAIRE
Nothing happened He rubbed his gun
against my butt at the vault - the
angry one Told me what he wanted to
do to me That’s all

FRAWLEY
You want to tell me what he said

CLAIRE
Not particularly

Frawley reaches over turns off his tape recorder

FRAWLEY
When someone gets a gun pointed in
their face - they’re never quite the
same again It’s going to change
you Don’t think it won’t

CLAIRE
I havent even cried

FRAWLEY
Itll come In my breast pocket
there youll find my card

She does her finger leaving a faint ink print

CLAIRE
What about my shoes

FRAWLEY
Those well have to hold on to for a
while Crime lab people that’s how
they are If they could wrap you up
and put you on a shelf for a few 2
weeks they would

CLAIRE
Might not be such a bad idea

A faint smile She returns his jacket to him Frawley
looking her over as she picks up her tattered stockings

FRAWLEY
“anything at all you call me

She looks at the card

CLAIRE
Thank you Agent Frawley

yelling “Booga-booga” scaring them back upstairs - then
turns back triumphant having field-tested his plan

KRISTA
You know what I miss Your sofa The
grip I used to get on that armrest

Her HAND slips inside his thigh - her fingers creeping up the
inseam Familiar and routine In his ear

KRISTA
How long has it been for you Its

in his fingers Jem SLAMS one down on the bar in front of
Doug the bottle erupting with foam

A KNOCK

Doug barefoot in boxers pads into the hall to listen He
sees a shadow in the stripe of light beneath the door

KRISTA Dug-ggy-
Her voice is bar-hoarse and bourbon-rich The knocking
becomes a cat-like NAIL-SCRATCHING Sy

KRISTA (0S)
I know you’re in there —

The door moves faintly her body against it He puts his
hand on the opposite side holding it still

KRISTA Tell me what you want me to do Why

He starts away pausing to look at his sofa - where the
armrest has been SCRATCHED OPEN

EXT BANK BOSTON KENMORE SQUARE BRANCH - DAY

Frawley touches the fresh wounds left in a telephone pole
GOUGE MARKS left by a lineman’s spikes Above two separate
Verizon Crews in cherry pickers examine the hacked junction

box above the Kenmore Square bank

Frawley returns to Dino near an unmarked Ford Taurus

“Tak el verse

FRAWLEY
Its got to be a lineman Dino We
can run Verizon employee records
Anyone who lives in the Town

As he speaks his eye is drawn to a YOUNG MAN entering the
bank wearing a baseball cap dark glasses and driving gloves
- clutching an white empty trash bag

DINO
Thats a lot of linemen

Dinos words pull Frawley back to the matter at hand

FRAWLEY
What else have we got A bleached-—
out crime scene a microwaved hard
drive A torched van

DINO
And a bank manager still not back at
work

Frawley looks back at the nearby bank

FRAWLEY
Everything about her says squeaky-
clean Except she’s hiding
something

The BEEPING noise is Dino’s phone going off

FRAWLEY
Why dont you ever answer her

DINO
I been married twenty-two years
Frawl There’s nothing left to say

Frawley turns back to the bank again - just as the same Young
Man exits striding quickly away There is something in the

white bag now but not trash C-notes line the one-ply bag

FRAWLEY
Youve got to be kidding me
(starting after him)

Dino missed the whole thing still looking at his phone-

DINO
Yeah one sec

“Frawley keeping pace with the Young Man weaving through the
midday crowd on the boulevard sidewalk Frawley pats his
pockets - a moment of distress - then finds his badge

FRAWLEY
Hey You there Hold it

The Young Man slows stops Breathing hard Frawley comes
up alone at the Young Mans back No Dino

FRAWLEY
Turn around Slow

As he does we see his sweat - a dope-sick drug addict

then we hear a FUSE-LIKE CRACKLING A HISSING ‘Coming
from the-bag The Young Man holds it up confused as —

He EXPLODES in a RED BURST

Or appears to - Frawley REELING BACKWARD to the pavement

throat burning He brings his hand up to his face - and sees
RED on his fingers and his badge

He struggles to his feet Something FLUTTERS near and he ©
grabs at it a 100 bill red-stained and burned Now he

sees the plastic bag burst open smoking He realizes a DYE
PACK Stained currency floating dream-like into the street

Frawley sees the red-stained Man fleeing and takes off after
him Two painted men running down the sidewalk

Frawley follows him around the corner - and into a chorus of
HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMS An elementary school playground His
appearance sends KIDS SCREAMING toward the building

Frawley charging hard TACKLES the Young Man Kids drop
down off monkey bars as Frawley pins the Man’s arms A BEAT
COP comes running up sidearm drawn but Frawley - coughing
half-blind - thrusts out his red-stained badge

ticking with the rest of the world Doug tugs on a limp
Mylar balloon tied to her chair but she barely responds

Doug moves empty beer bottles and a full ashtray taking a
controller off a stack of porn mags and sitting down

DOUG
Got some pretty heavy reading
material there Jem boy

JEM
Some days you just wake up horny
Got all this fucking energy I
already worked out shoulders and
calves twice

DOUG
(nodding to bathroom)
Maybe you should go deal with it

JEM
Told you I don’t do that no more

DOUG
Youre serious

JEM
They say weed saps your ambition I
say yanking it does

Jem curls his player into Dougs a hard CHECK They drop
gloves and square off game announcer bellowing “FIGHT”

JEM
Like old times kid Can you tell me
why we don’t do this every fucking —
day

As punches fly Doug hears the door glass RATTLE downstairs

DOUG
Krista’s home

JEM
Its cool man She wont bug us

Hung-over Krista enters with a bag of diapers under her arm
She crosses to Shyne swiping some cracker mush from her
daughter’s mouth before lifting her out

‘Krista looks at Doug a moment with shyne on her hip When
she gets no response or reaction from him she leaves

- DOUG
Let me get my take Get it squared
away

JEM
You taking off already

DOUG
I’11 come back down later

Jem stands dejected He yanks the molding out from the
doorway between the parlor and the kitchen revealing slot--
like shelves inside and newspaper-wrapped parcels

DOUG
You stashing here now You take a
search warrant someday you dont
think theyre gonna tap the walls

JEM
Always so fucking panicked DigDug

Jem hands Doug his thick bundle cash showing through then
hammers the molding back in place with the heel of his hand

JEM

doing a RAIN DANCE Gloansy and Dez - losers again - watch
as their chips are swept away forever

- Doug at a Blackjack table drops a healthy stack of
hundreds which the Dealer plays out on the velvet before
dunking into the slot in exchange for stacks of chips

- Roulette wheel slows Jem losing BIG this time He points
out a Hot Waitress to distract Gloansy and Dez - then nicks
chips from their dwindling stacks

Doug hits on 21 He rises done many chips in his tray

- At the Cashier’s Window Doug exchanges chips for clean
cash He turns and sees Jem Gloansy and Dez dancing in a
circle like warrior braves and can’t help but smile

steak in KETCHUP amused yet sober The SERVER brings the

of them wasted - smiling up at a sinuous STRIPPER

JEM
You Irish
(she shakes her head)
How come there’re no Irish strippers

‘GLOANSY
‘Cause they all dance like this

He rises and attempts the “Riverdance” - knees high arms
tight at his sides - and falls breaking up the others

LATER

Doug sits for a private lap dance his DANCER watching her
own performance in the wal mirror TWO BOUNCERS brush past
EJECTING drunken Jem the angry STRIPPER following

Dougs DANCER stops reaching out to TOUCH THE SCAR over his
eye a moment of unusual intimacy surprising them both

cap of the stoop light brushing out dead bugs

MRS SEAVEY -Here I am Douglas

She unchains the door pulling it wide of her walker MRS

SEAVEY is 80 frail but cheerful

DOUG
Hows that leg Mrs Seavey Getting
around okay

With a mischievous half-dreaming grin she releases “the
walker and shuffles back and forth in her foam slippers

MRS SEAVEY
Da-daa—dee-da

From the hardware bag Doug pulls out coiled light bulbs

DOUG
I bought you these fancy ones ‘cause
they reminded me of you

MRS SEAVEY
Aha Screwy

DOUG
(reading)
Nah “Extended life Years of
continuous illumination”

She titters as he screws in a new bulb

DOUG

until late tonight

MRS SEAVEY
As long as you want boy But why

Catholic girl happy

EI MRS SEAVEY’S GARAGE - MINUTES LATER

Doug unlocks a side door lit by a plastic blue yard-shrine
VIRGIN MARY Halogen lamps inside reveal a CORVETTE ZR-1
with a pristine emerald green finish His pride and joy

He proceeds to the rear of the garage a four-foot drop

leading to a dirt-floored storage area cluttered with ancient
bikes and a rusted snowblower He crouches and pulls away a
large rock exposing a CASH-FILLED CAVITY

Out of the True Value bag he adds banded stacks of CASH
separating the washed from the unwashed -

INT CONVENIENCE STORE —- MORNING

Doug passing brightly lit cooler shelves stocked with BEER -
reaching into a cramped slot alongside them for a liter
bottle of MOUNTAIN DEW Straightening he sees

Claire Keesey halfway down in Hair Care Undercover
almost in sweats and a balicap ponytail pulled through

She chooses shampoo Doug shadows her to the magazine racks
where she pulls down Shape Then deliberating she grabs
Whoppers malted-milk balls - folding her Magazine over them

Doug impulsively takes a soft Red Sox ball toy off the rack -
and falls into line right behind her

He sees the soft curve of her neck then the key chain purse
in her hands Her drivers license window is still empty

She pays and exits Doug watches her through front windows
painted with DOLLAR SIGNS

EXT MONUMENT SQUARE - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER

Doug in his Caprice again watching Claire’s front door she
exits cap brim low trundling a basket of laundry He’s
thinking Am I going to do this

INT DOUGS APARTMENT - MINUTES LATER

“THROWING laundry into a bag

INT JAY’S ON THE CORNER - LAUNDROMAT - MINUTES LATER

Doug feigning interest in a newspaper watching Claires back
as she eats malted milk balls They are alone but for the
Greek proprietor and an Old Woman watching TV- ‘

Claires dryer time winds down her sneakers rumbling pum-
pum-pum-stop She heads to a CHANGE DISPENSER in back
repeatedly feeding it a crumpled dollar bill

An opening Doug approaches her tentatively a handful of
quarters in his fist But the dispenser accepts her bill
paying out change - leaving him stranded She returns to her
laundry her back to him He can’t back down now

DOUG
Excuse me

She turns fast startled to see him there

DOUG
Hi uh I was wondering if you
knew -

He’s so focused on his delivery it takes a moment to
register that there are tears in her eyes She swipes at
them fast and guilty then covers with a smile

DOUG
I-oh-

‘The tears reappear and she tries to smile again Then she

gives up turning away resuming her folding

DOUG
You okay

Her look this time ig harsh imploring Please go away She
scoops up the rest of her clothes a tennis sock and lilac
panties dropping to the floor Head down she rushes to the
front door another dryer load still churning behind her

DOUG
Hey you forgot

Shes gone Doug picks up the sock and panties then sees

the Old Woman staring accusingly at him When Claires load

stops he opens his fist and feeds quarters into her dryer
CROSS FADE TO

Dryers still churning around him Doug sits ina bucket seat
dozing A figure stands above him Claire

Cc
Excuse me hi Hello

BOUG
Oh hey - how are you

CLAIRE
Really embarrassed I wanted to
apologize

DOUG
No no I hate those machines I
was going to beat it up for you

CLAIRE
Im having a really bad month and it
all kind of hit me at once

DOUG
As long as you’re better

Someof her remaining clothes sit folded on the table

CLATRE
Much yes Anyway - thanks for the
quarters and pulling my clothes out
And--
(noticing now)
Folding some of them

DOUG
Hope that was all right Kind of
weird I guess folding a stranger’s
laundry

CLAIRE
-Anyway I’m sorry I ran off like
that Thank you again

He watches her retreat to the machine wanting to say
something more He heads back to his spot across the table -
stopping halfway steeling himself and starting back

DOUG
Listen I know it’s already been an
emotional day for both of us but
I wouldn’t forgive myself if I didn’t
at least take my shot here

CLATRE
Your shot Excuse me

Her eyebrows flinch at his poor choice of words Her
expression says Are you kidding me

DOUG
Yeah my shot It’s going to haunt
me for months

CLAIRE
Are you really that hard on yourself

DOUG
You don’t even know a

He stands shifting his weight at a loss for words

CLAIRE
Well so is this it now Are you
taking your shot

DOUG

like me could actually cross this
‘room and talk to’a quality person
like yourself

She squints smiling faintly unsure what to make of him

CLAIRE

DOUG

INT THE TAP - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT

Doug sits at a back table rearranging the salt and pepper -
shakers He tries to appear relaxed wearing stiff new
clothes He scans the menu for the eighth time Finally he
stands starting heavy-legged past the Yuppies at the glass
bar heading for the front door

Just then Claire bursts in flustered looking past him
Doug hesitates - as yet unseen - then starts to leave

CLAIRE
Oh my God you’re right here Were
you leaving I’m so sorry I didn’t
— you look different

DOUG
Do I yeah

She sizes him up concerned about her own clothes now - a
simple blouse and distressed jeans

CLAIRE
I was running late I thought more
-casual

DOUG
Doesnt matter I think I folded
-those jeans
CLAIRE

At the table the Server comes back uncorking the bottle as
Claire talks over the din

CLAIRE
And I got scared Just really--

Claire samples the wine

CLAIRE
Nervous That’s great thank you

Doug looking away notices Splash (the downstairs bartender)
- upstairs here retrieving more High Lifes from the glass bar
Doug glances away before Splash can make him

still tucked under Dezs chin and tucking it into Dez’s
pocket Dez slows at the sidewalk stopping Doug

DEZ
Look this may be stupid but this

Doug strides right into the street straight toward the
Cavalier The car’s engine ROARS to life as he gets there
swinging into the road Doug doesn’t budge

The car STOPS at his knees Doug comes around to the drivers

Then the car PEELS OUT Doug KICKING the side as it goes He
runs hard the other way reaching the corner in time to see
the Cavalier speeding off Dez catches up with him

Waiting in his idling emerald Corvette Doug sees Claire in
the lamplight in a shimmering black top and turquoise skirt
He eases the ZR-1’s gleaming prow along the curb at her knees
and hops out feeling good - until he sees her eyes widen

feels the sudden sting of foolishness

CLAIRE’

I did a terrible thing yesterday I
watched a soap opera There was this
corny scene with the ‘woman gazing off
for her big close-up sighing “Why
am I falling for you” It was so over-
the-top I was laughing when I turned
it off But then I got to thinking

(softly)
Why am I falling for you

Her words hit him like booze

CLAIRE

Its like I know you really well but
youre not real Like I invented
you Are you real Doug

DOUG
I think so

CLAIRE
I dont even have your phone number
Ox your address - no house to drive
past and torment myself and wonder
Is he home”

DOUG
You mean you want references

Yes I can’t help feeling theres
something
(searching)
Are you married

She lets out a tiny SCREAM - “AAAH” startling nearby ducks
and the Old Men She pulls on him staring into his eyes

CLAIRE
Yes or no Am I making a mistake

Doug looks down at her hands manacling his wrists

bouc

DOUG
Two years after my mother left he
drew a twenty-one month sentence I
drew twenty-one months in a foster

Dizzying and freeing him speaking these words

chair back looking up at a jet trail in the sky He pulls
out his money roll peeling off bills
Someone pokes him in the back of the neck

VOICE

Doug tenses - then turns and sees it’s Jem wearing a Red Sox
jersey and a white-lipped smirk Then Doug really tenses

Her breathing is SMOTHERED eyes wide

He reaches beneath her shirtsliding his fingers around her

jeans waist-then up her stomach to the satin band linking

Finally he eases off her Her eyes accost him He removes
his hand from her mouth - knowing now that he was wrong
