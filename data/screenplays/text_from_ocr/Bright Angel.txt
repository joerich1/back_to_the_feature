EXT DUCK MARSH - DAWN

JACK RUSSELL and his 18-year-old son GEORGE crouch in a
makeshift cattail blind Roosting ducks are dropping into
the marsh On the water floats an arrangement of duck
decoys which have lured the ducks to the pond

In the blind Jack holds a long-barrel semi-automatic
shotgun George mans a sealed-beam car-light hooked to a
portable car battery The light is not yet shining Jack
peeks through at the ducks while George keeps his head down
checking and retwisting the connections to the battery
It’s mid-June on the northern Montana Hi-line and it’s
chilly as the sky barely lightens eastward The ducks
settle and the marsh goes quiet Jack in the blind takes
a long deep breath squeezes off the safety of his shotgun
regards his son beside hin

JACK
Shine George Shine now
George clicks the crude switch on the car-light and the
yellow beam streams out onto the marsh surface through the
cattails The ducks are there all of them on the water
completely exposed and not yet alarmed by the light Jack
stands and begins shooting down on the water with the
shotgun methodical shooting not fast but gauged to cover
as much of the water as he can Most of the ducks are hit
sitting in the water but some fall just as they begin to

lift off Jack shoots in all eleven times On the water
after the last gun blast there are 54 ducks dead or dying
JACK
(quietly)
Well There’s that
GEORGE
Yessir

time Good work on the light
George You were steady as a rock

Jack and George begin to wade into the marsh to collect the
ducks floating there

conversation can’t be heard The man puts his arm on Jack’s
back says another ardent word then walks out of the bar

JACK

If I were you I’da worry we might
not Things pass too fast in your
life George Don’t worry about

fields He cuts the lights and the engine Jack rolls down
his window and puts his face out listening

’ JACK (CONT’D)

They drive into the house yard The house is a prairie
farmhouse white-frame and dormered with a front porch «-
MAJOR a black Labrador retriever walks out of the Quonset

Jack opens the car door and gets out

INT KITCHEN NIGHT 14

George and Jack enter from the mud-room steps A tall

young man WOODY who is maybe 29 stands behind the kitchen
table He’s dressed nicely in beige pleated pants and a
floral shirt with the short sleeves neatly rolled partly
disclosing a tattoo He has wavy blond hair combed back on
the sides Woody is a stranger and seems not intended to be
found Woody keeps his eyes on Jack A glass of whiskey
sits on the table Jack looks around the kitchen

JACK
(flatly but charged)

He disappears up the stairs to confront his wife as the
phonecontinues to ring George stares at the phone which
is on a table beside the stairs He seems to want to answer
it but does not

GEORGE

(quietly)
Let’s just go outside

WOODY
All right

They step toward the door

EXT HOUSECAR YARD - DARK 15

George and Woody step outside into the car yard and stand
waiting beside the house Woody shuffles foot-tofoot It
isn’t at all clear why he doesn’t leave while he has the
chance Though he’s a nullity--his effect on the world is
only chaotic and his behavior random Woody smokes a
cigarette as they stand and it’s not possible to see that
he’s wearing cheap black and white shoes
WOODY

I like it out here Nothing to

bother you I bet you could see

Chicago if the world was flat The

Great Plains commence here

GEORGE

JACK (INSIDE)
That’s a real joke Find your
goddamned suitcase Just find it

Inside a drawer opens and slams shut George looks
anxiously at the house He sees Aileen then Jack pass by
the upstairs window arguing Woody seems not to notice
They hear a plane flying overhead

WOODY
I once passed my brother in the Los
Angeles airport you know and
didn’t even recognize him He
recognized me though Of course he
said “Hey bro are you mad at me
or what I wasn’t mad at him We
both had to laugh

George eyes Woody with both suspicion and interest A pause
opens

WOODY (CONT’D)
Did you know your mother was married
before

GEORGE
Yes I knew that

WOODY
(smiling knowingly)
It happens to all of them now
They can’t wait to get divorced

GEORGE
I guess so

Jack suddenly comes out of the house with AILEEN behind hin
Aileen is carrying a suitcase She is a handsome young-
looking woman 42 years old She stops at the top of the
back steps looking grave Jack is coldly furious and looks
shaken He walks straight up to Woody comes close enough
for their clothing to touch Aileen gives George a guarded
half-smile

JACK
(softly)
What do -you do for a living

WOODY
I’m in the Air Force

15
JACK
Is this your day off then
WOODY
No
JACK

What’s the matter with you Don’t
you understand something

Jack takes a big revolver out of his coat pocket and puts it
under Woody’s chin Woody’s face rises but his arms stay
at his sides

JACK (CONT’D)
I don’t know what to do with you I
don’t have any idea I just don’t

Jack pulls the hammer back and raises the gun higher under
Woody’s chin For a long moment no one says a word

AILEEN
(calmly finally)
Jack let’s stop now Let’s just
stop

Jack looks into Woody’s face his teeth gritted together

JACK
You’re crazy aren’t you You’re a
goddamned crazy man Are you in
ilove with her too Are you Say
you love her so I can blow your
fucking brains in the sky

woopy

Woody’s chin

AILEEN (CONTD) 15
George has to be at work in the morning

She mouths Silently but very intently to George
AILEEN
You do what your father tells you to

Aileen walks off the steps rounds the corner of the house
and disappears into the ark Woody’s car door opens and
shuts audibly Jack returns his attention to Woody

JACK
I’d like to think of some way to
hurt you I feel helpless about it
(pause)
You think I’m a fool

WOODY

No
JACK

Where are you from

WwoOoDY
Chicago A suburb of there

JACK
(intensely)
Are your parents alive

Jack pushes the gun harder under Woody’s chin

WOODY
Yes Yes sir

JACK
Too bad they have to know what you
are I bet they both wish you were
dead thoughSomebody else’1l have
to kill you I don’t want to have
to think about you
(lowers the gun)
I guess that’s it

Jack just stands perfectly still in front of Woody the gun
at his side Woody says nothing He waits an awful moment
then steps back looks at George then quickly follows where
Aileen has gone Jack looks at George helplessly

JACK (CONT’D)
Does this seem stupid to you All
this yelling and going nuts I
wouldn’t blame you You shouldn’t
even see this I don’t know what to
do now

PINK PAGE 7689

GEORGE
(sympathetically)
It’ll be all right

George walks out to the road He stands watching Woody
back the car out of the field The car stops a moment while
Woody and Aileen sit in the car seat and have an animated
conversation George can’t hear It is only clear they
aren’t arguing When the car moves off Aileen turns and
waves at him through the back window then Woody drives away
down the road into the cold night

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Jack has mixed himself a drink and now furiously puts
together sandwiches for the both of them He’s on the edge
and trying to stay sane The pistol is lying on the table
George puts it into a kitchen drawer

JACK
So What do you think

GEORGE
You could’ve been more limited
maybe Maybe you shouldn’t have had
her leave

JACK
That’s one version Okay That was
a mistake She should still be
here I guess This is not her
usual

GEORGE
You could probably go find her We could ao that

JACK
(sarcastic)
Where would you look

GEORGE
I don’t know Maybe in the café

JACK

GEORGE

Jack moves George by his shirt sleeve to the old-fashioned
high-faucet sink turns on the hot tap pushes George’s
hands under and begins to soap them fiercely George
flinches from the painful water but his father’s hands are
in it too and he submits

JACK
Harsh words are all alike George
You can make ‘em up They all mean
the same thing

GEORGE
What’s that

JACK

Jack quits washing George’s hands wipes his own on his
pants

is open beside her as if she were alone in a bathroom
Claude rigs up the fishing rod from the back seat

CLAUDE
You’1l have to look real close if

George watches Lucy intently It is a gift to him that he’s
about to see her undressed She turns naked now to see
George watching her

LUCY
Have a good look I’ve got a
brother remember
(steps into the cold water)

Claude walks off down the river bank 20 yards and begins
turning up rocks for bait Lucy stands in the stream dips
water up onto her arms underarms and across her chest She
has a small bar of motel soap in her palm and uses it
sparingly

Lucy
(to George)
Which way’s north I like to stay
oriented

George glances at the sun and points west without speaking

LUCY (CONT’D)
You got a clothespin on your tongue

She continues dipping water onto herself as though to taunt
him with herself Down the bank Claude finds something he
likes for bait rigs up a hook and casts his line into a
slow-moving eddy He is skillful and seems confident of
catching a fish

Lucy (CONT’D)
Did you ever have the dream that
somebody you knowis leading you
into a river and just when you’re
knee-deep you step into a hole and

suitcase realizing a tiny bit of modesty She puts on a long flannel shirt
a mens size She stands and walks up the grass bank to where George sits

Lucy

She takes a beer out of the six-pack and sits on the grass beside him On
the RADIO a weather forecast for central Wyoming is audible Rain is forecast

Claude jerks the fish up onto the bank He whoops with enthusiasm

GEORGE
(Softly)
My mother took off recently and I was glad about
it Im ashamed of that

Lucy
Thats a shameful lie right there Shes
probably happy anyway
Lucy is clearly moved by Georges admission and sympathetic to his
predicament She pulls closer to him looking up but at a loss for how
to sympathize correctly She takes off her sunglasses and looks up at George

Lucy (CONTD)
Why dont you just kiss me ‘Just for a minute

George looks down at Claude whos dragging a big whitefish up onto the bank

LUCY (CONTD)
I dont care Let him see us

She reaches up and kisses George hard first with her lips sealed then
with her lips parted

(enthusiastically)

Isn’t it lively

It’s a whitefish

They’re good to eat

Lucy

What a surprise that must be for the fish
Everything just qoes crazy at once I wonder what it

thinks
CLAUDE
Fish don’t think

He kneels beside the fish
tries to take the hook out

holding a long clasp knife and
with a deft turn of his knife

blade but in doing it he causes the fish to twist in his

grasp and the knife to jab

his palm He drops the knife

wrings his hand then sucks the cut

CLAUDE

(CONT’D)

(hand in his mouth)
Son of a bitch thing Fucking fish

is dangerous

LUCY

Is that the Indian way of fishing

Claude glares at her in a fury He seems moved to strike
her and it is a moment of fierce tension

(hatefully)
Okay It’s your

something with it I don’t want the

Lucy looks at the fish and
seems to relax

Lucy
Okay

by some inner grasp-on-purpose

(reaches forward)

Let me have that

Claude picks up the knife and extends it but as
for it he jabs it at her

CLAUDE
You might kill me if I gave this to
you

Claude looks at George trying to be amused
Lucy
I’m going to put this poor fish out
of its misery

CLAUDE
Okay Do it

she reaches

He hands Lucy the knife She merely leans over and
confidently pushes the knife--not without resistance-—
straight through the fish’s side behind the gills The
fish makes a noise in its throat Lucy then raises the
whole contraption-knife and fish together--and slings it

out into the river where it disappears

LUCY
There you go

(looks inquiringly at George)
You want me to be ashamed of that
too

It is a tense moment

GEORGE
No

CLAUDE
I bet you’11 do anything won’t you

He’s been vanquished and doesn’t know what to do to ease the

humiliation

CLAUDE (CONT’D)
You’d fuck a pig in knickers I bet
You Canada girls

sometimes

This obviously refers to Sherman Claude steps toward her
and with his fingertips very slowly raises the front of the

shirt Lucy’s wearing

Everybody thinks they’re good for
something Or are you just good for
nothing

Claude raises the shirt further uncovering her

You boys all seem alike to me

Claude unbuttons the top button of Lucy’s shirt while
George looks on He’s clearly about to rape her

ring shallow makeshift ceiling lights and a sparse drunk
crowd in attendance--vaguely interested COWBOYS INDIANS and
their GIRLFRIENDS Two INDIAN BOYS spar but no one in the
audience pays much attention some are booing and taunting
the boxers The Indians are bloodying each other almost
without effort

George is remotely cocky Lucy is half-drunk and ill-
tempered from the strain of the previous days and from her
responsibilities i

GEORGE
How do you think you can get
somebody out of jail

LUCY
I’ve got a plan to do it

code of conduct with regard to George--some innocence in him
touching some innocence in her But now from fatigue or
compromise or familiarity or futility giving in to each

consolation

George regards Lucy as though he would help her Lucy is on
the ground injured but not unconscious

ART (CONT’D)
Don’t be a shithead Just put Bob
in the hole

GEORGE
(dazed)
All right 111 put him in there

George his face and hand hurt swelling and painful is
chastised and under Art‘s direction now

ART
(ludicrously)
You fucking kids People kill each
other It’s not just some board
game I’m fifty-four years old
I’11l kill you dead as shit
(MORE)

ART (CONT’D)
(noticing Lucy)
How’s Miss Priss

George clumsily and with difficulty rolls Bob’s corpse over
across the oil rig landing then upends it into the open
well Nina kneels to minister to Lucy who’s bleeding from
her scalp Nina has a Kleenex packet Lucy takes one

NINA
Here’s a tissue hon Wipe your
blood off

Lucy
(dazed)
I’m fine

George pushes Bob’s legs so that they go down shoves the
shag carpet to conceal it then replaces the planking--while
Art is watches him with the shotgun and flashlight

ART
Put him in there right Jesus

When he is finished George stands under the derrick waiting
to be told what to do next Lucy gets to her feet and
stands close to George They are both stricken She is
shivering in the wind and rain

ART (CONT’D)
to Lucy)
All right where’s the goddamn
money I want it right now

LUcY
(dazed)
Here it is

She extends the purse with the money inside Bob takes it
then hands it to Nina who goes through the money

NINA
(to Art)
Three thousand

ART
Where‘’s the rest of it There’s
more of it I want all of it

GEORGE
That wasn’t the deal

73

ART
There isn’t any deal The deal’s in
that hole over there

GEORGE
(fearful) -
We were supposed to tell you when
Johnny got out

ART
He’s not getting out He killed a
pipefitter out in Natrona--he hates
goddamn pipefitters He’s not
getting out He probably forgot to
tell you

Lucy
He did

ART
He stabbed this guy with a
screwdriver I saw him do it Just
where’s the money sweetheart
Lots of dead people are out here
Nobody’s going to notice you two

GEORGE
(to Lucy)
Give him the key

Lucy who’s obviously hurt badly reaches in her skirt
pocket and produces the empty locker key and gives it to
Art Art holds the key in the light looks at Lucy
curiously

ART
(to Lucy)
What’s this some school locker key
You leave it in your locker

LUCY
We didn’t

GEORGE
It’s at the bus station

NINA
I don’t want to go there I’ve been
‘in too many bus stations

ART
You want this money

u)

NINA
Yeah but I hate bus stations
ART
Just get the cuffs out of the glove

box -

Nina retrieves the handcuffs from the car and Art takes them
then marches Lucy and George over to the rig where Bob’s
body is stashed An edge of the carpet is visible through
the planks

ART (CONT’D)
(to George and Lucy)
You sit down here And you sit on
the other side of this pipe It1l
do you good

It is a pipe attached to a piece of rigging and when George
and Lucy are seated close together but on opposite sides of
the pipe Nina closes the handcuffs on each one of their
wrists so that they can’t escape She then moves the cuff
around on Lucy’s wrist who’s shuddering now from the onset
of shock

NINA
Is that too tight I don’t want it
to cut off circulation
(to Art)
You hit her too hard She‘s
shivering

ART

(to George ignoring Nina)
I can’t believe you tried to hit me
with that plank If the money isn’t
in the box I’m coming back out here
by myself If it’s there then
maybe something nice’1l happen to
you

NINA
(smiling brainless)
You kids’1l be okay here

She runs her hand sweetly through Lucy’s hair then she and
Art walk toward the Cadillac

NINA (CONT’D)
I just don’t think you should leave
them out here exposed

73
ART
(archly)
Don‘tcha
NINA
No I think we should take them -
ART
(calmly)
Do you want me to leave you out here
with them
NINA

I don’t want that No

ART
Well then catch a ride with me

Art gets in the car Nina looks at Lucy and George then
Climbs in the Cadillac They darive away
EXT OIL WELL - NIGHT 74

When Art and Nina have disappeared George thinks he sees a

“way of getting loose by raising their two joined hands to a

loosely threaded bolt in the pipe loosening it and setting
them free Wind is whipping the rain and Gebris around
then

GEORGE

i Stand up I want to reach that pipe
bolt They’re not going to strand
us out here

Lucy is very unsteady but they both manage to stand
George tries reaching the bolt with her hand joined to his
injured hand then climbing to it ‘

GEORGE (CONT’D)
Climb up on your side

Lucy
Tocan’t It’s all right

GEORGE
Well fuck it then

They sit back on the cold planks side by side Lucy wears
only her cloth coat skirt and shoes

LUCY
(fractured)
Get closer I’m frozen

GEORGE
Fold your hand in

She reluctantly folds her thumb and little finger into her
palm George tries to pull then twist then wedge the
handcuff off her small hand But fails -

Lucy
Nature is the enemy You’re not
even Catholic

GEORGE
NoListen Are you okay

She puts her head on his shoulder and gives in a little

Lucy
This hurts I hate a marble sky
They make me so sad No stars Im
going to just be still Itl1 be
okay Im young enough

George looks at Lucy’s wound

LUCY (CONT’D)
(shivering)
That’s okay isn’t it

GEORGE
It is It’s okayGoddamn it 1
need to start a fire

LUCY
You’1l burn us up I want to tell
you that I did not go down on your
friend Klaus or Claude or Carl I

guess

GEORGE
I didn’t believe that

George painfully goes into his pocket for matches It’s
obvious he’s scared and that Lucy is failing though she
isn’t precisely aware of it He finds the matches and looks
around him for something flammable He strikes a match and
holds it to some of the planking but the wind snuffs it

He tries again then again without success

Lucy
He did ask me to marry him

GEORGE
(matter-of-factly)
I can see you married To somebody

PINK PAGE 7689

Lucy
(sweetly)
Who to You

George is frantic but attempting to appear calm He tries
to take off his own jacket and can actually slip it off his
arm and onto hers so that it covers her He’s left with a
flannel shirt Lucy seems at one moment relatively clear-
headed the next confused -
GEORGE
No To somebody elseDo you think
I’m pretty handsome

Lucy
(fatigued)
You might become handsome I don’t
know
(draws closer)
Oh I’m so cold now Your coat
doesn’t help much

She is becoming light-headed again

Lucy (CONT’D)
My head feels zizzy You‘re
supposed to get out of bad things
aren’t you

GEORGE
I don’t know

LUCY
If I’d known Johnny had killed
somebody I would’ve never come down
here The fuckerI wish I was
older

GEORGE
(holding her closer)
It‘ll be all right

Lucy
(pause)
You could tell me some dream of
yours I feel like hearing a dream
ali of a sudden Maybe I’m short of
sleep That’d be nice Do you
remember one

GEORGE
(musing)
Yes

PINK PAGE 7689

Lucy
Which way’s north now I like to
stay oriented

Lucy tries to look around though she’s losing her strength
George motions with his head toward the desert clothed in
darkness

GEORGE
It’s that way

Lucy
Ill never get back tnere

(rests close to him)
What was your dream Georgie

GEORGE
It was when we were driving down
here

LUCY

Wait Lie on top of me baby Make
me warmer

George negotiates himself sideways so that he can move on
top of her his face near hers his lips close to her ear

LUCY (CONT’D)
Oh that’s good I’m fine now

George turns his head so he can look down at the glittering
city

GEORGE
In this dream I was driving down
some highway and it was snowing
And off the road there was a wrecked
car on fire And inside in the
flames were these people I could
see them in the windows trying to
get out But they were trapped
And I stopped and ran up and I
pulled the door and pulled it and
pulled it until it opened but it
was hot and smokey inside And I
reached and grabbed inside and I
felt all their hands First an
adult’s hands and then children’s
And I took them all out until they
were all out in the dark beside the
highway Safe And I just stood

and nobody talked But I was their
hero

Lucy has fallen asleep close to him -

GEORGE (CONT’D)
(imploring)
Don’t go to sleep That’s a
mistake There’s more in this
dream

George shakes her then slaps her cheeks softly with his
injured hand trying to keep her alert

LUCY
(feebly)
That’s a sweet dream You’re the
hero Your conscience is clear
isn’t it

She dozes

GEORGE
No no don’t go to sleep I
shouldn’t have told that to you
‘I’m sorry

LUCY
(drifting off)
I’m blue I must be blue I feel
blue Goodness
She passes into sleep
GEORGE
(faintly)
Don’t sleep I could marry you I
could
He desperately shakes her and simultaneously tries to cover
her with his body finally embraces her when she doesn’t
respond She is in shock The rain and wind swirl around
then

EXT OIL RIG DAWN
It is the moment before the first light of dawn The lights

«

ef Casper still twinkle A pair of car lights moves up the
road For a time it’s not clear that Art has not come back
though as the lights come nearer the car grows visible as a
reservation police car on a night patrol When the car
nears the oil rig it stops A POLICEMAN runs his
flashlight across the well platform disclosing Lucy and
George who seem asleep where they’ve been handcuffed and
are covered with dirt and frost When they reach George one
of the Indian policemen squats brushes frost off George’s
face

POLICEMAN
What are you two doing here

He shakes George who wakes to the light in his face and the
faraway sound of the Indian’s voice Lucy remains still
beneath him almost unnoticeable The policeman holds his
finger to Lucy’s neck but there’s no pulse

POLICEMAN
(to his partner)
Not this one

GEORGE
(faint desperate)
I have the right key She made a
mistake You can have it now

In an instant George recollects himself tries to lift
himself off Lucy turns his face to hers and sees she’s died
of shock and concussion during the night

casually enters from another office carrying a metal
container which he sets on his desk and from which he
produces George’s wallet some change a clasp knife and the
locker key from the Greyhound depot

George picks up his belongings with his bandaged hand and
stuffs them in his pockets

The detective puts up his feet and pulls his pants legs up
over his boot tops revealing the butt of a pistol in one

George takes a seat to begin his 3-hour wait for the bus

home The effects of the last few days have settled on him
and he is abstracted and undirected
on his hand and exercises his fingers painfully

the bandage away

He’s incapable of relaxing or sitting still and begins to

wander around the bus station As he does
fracture He passes people randomly overhearing
conversations becoming indistinguishable within the

populated depot

I went out there in the night where
he was changing his shirt

OVERHEARD

I wondered if the FBI would be

calling my house

He stares at soldiers and Indians

time seems

to

old men and

backpackers fixating on an idle gesture or on someone’s

shoes He’s becoming more abstracted

OVERHEARD

I thought he wanted me you know
But when he started he just lost his

heart

He plays pinball He goes into the little diner drinks a

He unwraps the bandage
He throws

Coke and watches the fry-cook For brief moments time seems

to slow down the sounds blurring

something shady follows-the man across the depot waiting
room and walks inside

INT RESTROOM - DAY 89

In the restroom a traveller is standing at the mirror wiping
his face after shaving George and the man step inside

The traveller glances at them The man sets his attache
case on a sink top opens it as if looking for papers
George looks around the room waits on what he isn’t sure
As he talks and unseen by George the man takes a pair of
cow-skin driving gloves out of his case and puts them on

I always look forward to eating a
decent meal when I come into town
you know But the one place I
really like this Enrique’s They
closed Just gone I like that
Italian food boy Lasagna
Vermicelli Veal Marsala

The traveller leaves George looks around relaxed by the
man’s conversation The man turns and looks at George
seriously

MAN (CONT’D)
All right now son

He steps in and hits George a hard blow with the flat of his
hand straight across the cheek knocking George against the
sinks and half off his feet The man advances on hin
quickly without speaking flashes an ungainly left hand--
open fist--and hits George across the other cheek knocking
him further down George scrambles up his eyes narrowed
gasping for breath Again the man very quickly and
methodically moves in but George slides off to the left and
when the man swings his flat hand George is angled beside
him and hits him 4 times in the face--in combinations-using
his painful injured hand and knocks the man against the
unlatched stall doors causing him to lose his balance and fall inside As with the
fight against the Indian hoy earlier this is a sudden
vicious unmerciful fight

Real ferocity has been triggered in him a fierceness
only the last week of his life could’ve precisely released

MAN
(Ending the test)
All right Back off yo
sonof a bitch

GEORGE
I’1ll beat you to death
MAN
(surprised)
Jesus It’s okay You’re trying to
kill me

GEORGE
(angrily)
What the fuck is this

George stops and steps back

MAN -—

GEORGE

George turns and staixs out of the bathroom He walks to the
seat hes been occupying Hes red-faced out-of-breath and
angry feeling hes been had He sits in a state of confused
belligerence his eyes darting THE MAN whos come out of the
restfomm after him - though not actually chasing him - approaches wiping nis face with a white ©
handkerchief
