INT MAIN CABIN
A CRYO-LOCKER BLOWS OPEN spitting out

CAROLYN FRY She hits the deck of the main cabin Four crew
lockers in a forward section countless more in back But the
deck is canted at a sick angle and ALARMS SCREAM everywhere
The world is dying around her

Legs wobbly shivering like a flu victim Fry stumbles to the

next forward locker Its riddled with holes One DEAD CREWIE

is seen through fractured plexi body pocked and bloodied But
in the next cryo-locked

The CAPTAIN is struggling awake Frys face floods with relief
Slapping an intercom

FRY
Hear me Capn Some kinda compromise to
the hullholding for now butGoddamn
Im glad youre alive Gotta pull your
E-releaseno red handle red handle
Ill get the warm-ups out while --

PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT Particles bore through the cabin
blasting open the captains chest shattering plexi DETONATING
INSTRUMENTS on the opposite wall and leaving CONTRAILS

HISSING in the air

Fry lands on her ass horrified Suddenly

Another LOCKER BLOWS OPEN A body falls right on top of Fry --
but this ones still alive Disoriented frantic

OWENS
Why did I fall on you

FRY
Hes dead Capns dead Christ I was
looking right at him when --

OWENS
I mean I mean chrono shows were 22
weeks out so gravity wasnt supposed to
kick in for another 19 I mean I mean
I mean why did I fall at all
FRY
You hear me Captains dead Owens too

OWENS
Oh no Not Owens not Wai wai
wait Im Owens Right

They swap nightmare looks momentarily unsure of their own
identities

FRY
Cryo-sleep Swear to God it sloughs
brain cells

INT NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

They stumble into nav-bay ALARMS CONTINUE Fry grabs warm-up
suits out of storage pitches one to Owens checks her screens

FRY
1550 millibars dropping 20 MB per minute
shit were hemorrhaging air Somethin
took a swipe at us

OWENS
Just tell me were still in the shipping
lane Just show me all those stars all
those bright beautiful deep-space

Owens activates an exterior view A planet rushes up at us
Thats why they have gravity

FRY
Jesus God
EXT SHIP - PLANETS ATMOSPHERE - DAY
The SHIP PLOWS through the upper atmosphere antennae pylons
already disintegrating
INT PASSAGE TO FLIGHT DECK

Heart battering her ribs Fry runs forward using hand-holds to
steady herself Over a headset
OWENS (VO)
They trained you for this right Fry
FRY

She doesnt answer

INT FLIGHT DECK - DAY

Fry harnesses in starts running switches -- but fumbles a few
times making mental errors Finally she gets crash-shutters

open to reveal

CLOUD STRATA sweeping up past the windscreen like floor-lights

on a dropping elevator Were shedding big altitude

INT NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

OWENS

crisis program selected Number Two of
this system because it shows at least some
oxygen and more than 1500 -- would you
SHUT THE FUCK UP

(hammers a button

SILENCES ALARMS)
-- more than 1500-millibars of pressure
at surface-level Okay so maybe the ship
did something right for a change

INT FLIGHT DECK - DAY

As Fry runs more switches

INT SHIP - DAY

As JETTISON DOORS CLOSE around the ship

INT FLIGHT DECK - DAY

As Fry flips up a security-latch -- and thumbs the switch

below
EXT SHIP - PLANETS ATMOSPHERE - DAY

MULTIPLE SHOTS EXPLOSIVE BOLTS RAPID-FIRE around the ships
skin blowing away non-essentials that hinder aerodynamics --
including big deep-space drives But this last separation puts
the ship into a dangerous roll

INT FLIGHT DECK - DAY

Out the windscreen cloud strata roll vertiginously Fry throws
actuators

EXT SHIP - PLANETS ATMOSPHERE - DAY
And airbrakes deploy She manages to kill the roll But the
ships still coming in nose-high
INT NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN
OWENS

showing no major water bodiesmaximum

terrain 220 meters over mean surface

largely cinder and gypsum with some

evaporite deposits

JETTISON DOORS CLOSE behind Owens segregating him from the
passenger compartment It scares him for a new reason

OWENS
Fry Whatre you doing
INT FLIGHT DECK - DAY

Fry flips up a new security-latch INTERCUTTING

OWENS
Fry

FRY
Cant get my nose downtoo much load
back there

OWENS
You mean that load of passengers

FRY
So what we should both go down too
Out of sheer fucking nobility

Tortured silence Frys thumb moves to the switch that will
jettison the passenger cabin Jettison 50 people

INT MAIN CABIN

SELECTED SHOTS of faces inside cryo-lockers among them JOHNS
Hes prime-of-life badge on display some kind of cop Shaken
awake he clears condensation to check the locker directly
across

from his finding

RIDDICK Small black goggles hide his eyes A metal bit wedged
in his mouth lends a perpetual grimace A read-out admonishes
LOCK-OUT PROTOCOL IN EFFECT ABSOLUTELY NO EARLY

RELEASE

INT FLIGHT DECK - DAY

OWENS
Look Fry Company says were responsible
for every one of those --

FRY
Companys not here is it

OWENS
When captain went down you stepped up --
whether you like it or not Now they
train you for this so --

FRY
And there wasnt a simulated cockroach
alive within 50 clicks of the simulated
crash site Thats how they train you
On a fucking simulator

Owens unbuckles from his chair

OWENS
Dont touch that switch

Overcome by guilt Fry retracts her thumb of mass destruction
But a HUGE JOLT puts the thumb right back

FRY
Im not dying for them

She pushes it But this time

EXT SHIP - PLANETS ATMOSPHERE - DAY

No bolts fire Nothing separates from the SHIP THAT SCREAMS DOWN
through the clouds

INT NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

Now we see why Owens reopened the jettison doors locally -- and
blocked them open

FRY
Owens

OWENS
70 seconds You still got 70 seconds to
level this beast out

INT FLIGHT DECK - DAY
Seething anger and guilt Fry pops more airbrakes shedding more

speed more heat The ship does level -- but its still being
pounded hellishly She tries to get a stable view out

The windscreen Were breaking through cloud-bottoms Theres
just a glimpse of landscape before

EXT SHIP - PLANETS ATMOSPHERE - DAY

An airbrake fails It shears off and pinwheels into

INT FLIGHT DECK - DAY
The windscreen It cracks into a thousand spiderwebs -- but
impossibly it holds For now

OWENS (VO)
What the shit was that

Sunlight flares from every fractured edge Its like looking
into burning diamonds and Fry can only get an impression

of the outside world Now she has to rely on

A ground-mapping display 120 meters altitude And dropping

INT CRYO-LOCKER - DAY

INTERCUT Johns Realizing hes in some kind of shit-storm he
claws at safety restraints

MPACT Johns BLOWS OUT of his locker -- and wishes to God he
wouldve stayed inside because just beside him

The hull is cracking open

NIGHTMARE SHOT A huge section of the cabin tears free
skitters and CRASHES along the planetfloor behind usand
disintegrates out of sight 40 cryo-lockers vanished with it
40 lives

INT FLIGHT DECK - DAY

Hammered by WIND Fry opens her eyes experimentally

FRYS POV A vortex of motion of speed of blurring debris
But the ship is burrowing in Burrowing under

Fry pivots her chair 180 degrees a nanosecond before
Dirt avalanches into the cockpit It buries CAMERA

BLACKOUT

INT MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

Choking yellow dust Ghostly silhouettes are COUGHING MOANING
CALLING OUT to other survivors in English and surreally in
Arabic Soon we find

Johns Ears running blood Stumbling his way to

Riddicks cryo-locker Empty Johns reaches for his holster
Gone torn right off his belt No prisoner and no weapon --

spooky combination Nearby he sees

The light of a cutting torch Someones using it to open a
jammed cryo-locker The plexi is torched away to reveal

AUDREY 12 years old Unscathed

AUDREY
Somethin went wrong huh

Johns searches for his pistol Behind him two chained feet
lower into FRAME -- and then attack swinging over Johns
head

getting the chain on his necktwisting hard using the chain
as

a choke-collar Johns flicks open a baton swings it up at

Riddick Still in body chains and mouth-bit Clinging toa
ceiling support Riding out the baton blows
Seconds from blacking out Johns strains forwardforwardand
finally breaks Riddicks grip on the support He keeps hold of
the chained feet so that

Riddick SLAMS HEADFIRST into the deck Johns lays the baton on
his neck

JOHNS
One chance and you blew it Riddick
Never cease to disappoint me

INT FLIGHT DECK - CRASH SHIP - DAY
Darkness A light beam sweeps the dusty air of the cockpit
Its packed with dirt no signs of life About to search

elsewhere Johns turns back at

FRY (0S)

JOHNS
Hey who

FRY (0S)
Hey me Over here

His light finds a headrest sticking up from the dirt Johns
crawls closer checks the other side of the headrest and finds
her Fry Buried to the gills

JOHNS
Amazing Im Johns

FRY
Carolyn Fry Id shake hands but

He manages a smile and starts digging her out Almost dreading
to ask

FRY
Are there any others Johns

INT MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY
Johns helps Fry through the carnage Shes stunned by it all --
but especially by the blast of sunlight where a hull used to be

Realizing shes in nav-bay Fry starts digging like a search dog
to uncover

Owens Still strapped to his chair Metal rod piercing his
chest close to the heart Dead Fry reaches out to touch him

OWENS
Out out out GET IT OUTTA ME

She recoils hard Hes still alive The other survivors bungle
over Ten seconds of pure chaos

VOICES
Pull it out of himNo its too close to
the heartYou gotta do it just do it
fast

Fry grabs the rod

OWENS
Dont touch it Dont touch that switch

VOICES
Youll kill him Im tellin you shit
just leave it alonedeliriousdoncha
you got some drugs for this poor man

OWENS
Dont touch that switch

FRY
Awright awright someonetheres
Anestaphine in the med-lock that end of
the cabinnext to

But there is no more that end In exquisite pain Owens
screams on REACTION SHOTS of Johns Audrey Seldom are human
beings witness to such raw suffering

FRY
Get away Everybody

The others leave -- except for Audrey staying behind to watch
in morbid fascination Johns doubles back and collars her
Leaving they pass

Riddick cuffed to a bulkhead His eyes still hidden by
goggles track Johns and Audrey toward daylight

EXT CRASH SHIP - DAY
The survivors straggle outside CAMERA SURVEYS new faces

ZEKE and SHAZZA Male-female team of bushwhackers partners in
life Shazza has a tough sexiness Zekes face shows aboriginal
blood (30s)

PARIS Overfed overgroomed A puff pastry of a man (40s or
50s)

Four male Chrislams The pillar-steady IMAM (50ish) and

THREE PILGRIMS young and excitable (late-teens) (NOTE The
Chrislams represent a union between Christianity and Islam They
have the iconography of Christians yet the physical look of Arab
Muslims)

WIDE SHOT All around them is stark and unforgiving terrain
The valley floor is relieved only by low hills to one side
spiked with earthen spires Scorching down on everything are
two suns -- one red one yellow

PARIS
Well Our own little slice of heaven

The Chrislams fall to their knees Confusion as they try to
orient themselves

IMAM
Pleasewhich way to New Mecca We must
know the direction in order to pray
North South East West Nobody knows Johns snaps open a
compass finds the needle swaying rudderlessly The SCREAMING
inside the ship finally ends
INT CRASH SHIP - DAY

As Fry holds Owens now dead
EXT CRASH SHIP - DAY

The four Chrislams have devised a way to pray Backs together
each faces a different compass point

EXT TOP OF CRASH SHIP - DAY

Fry climbs onto the back of the ship Johns Paris Zeke Shazza
Audrey are already here

JOHNS
Big talk about a scouting party

Fry sees the huge smoldering scar in the ground behind the ship
One glance confirms that there are no other survivors

JOHNS (CONTD)
then we saw this

PARIS
Anyone else having breathing problems
Aside from me

AUDREY
Like I just ran or something

SHAZZA
Feel one lung short All of us

PARIS
Well I tend toward the asthmatic And
with all this dust

Faces turn to Fry Theyre looking to her for answers

FRY
Its the atmosphere Too much pressure
not enough oxygen Might take a few days
to --

ZEKE
So what the bloody hell happened anyways

FRY
Somethin knocked us off-lane Maybe a
rogue comet Maybe well never know

SHAZZA
Well I for one am thoroughly fucking
grateful This beast wasnt made to land
like this But cripes you rode it down
(to others)
Cmon you lousy ingrates only reason
were alive is acuzza her

Others CHIME AGREEMENT laying thankful hands on Frys
shoulders

HOLD on Fry her face betraying nothing as they anoint her their
savior

INT MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

Breaking out pressure suits

FRY
Liquid oxygen canisters inside Start
ripping them out Quick hits only -- try

to make it last

AUDREY

Well is someone coming for us Or are
we all just gonna die of exposure or
dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even
something worse

(off their looks)
Hey you dont have to worry about scaring
me

SHAZZA
Were worried youll scare us
(ushering her away)
Names Audrey right love And youre
goin to Taurus Three like we were

AUDREY
Yeah butdo we even have enough food
to get there Or will we have to resort
to cannibalism

ZEKE
(to Fry)
Ill see bout makin this air go a bit
further capn With your permission
a course

Fry blinks They actually think Im the captain Zeke and the
others get to work Fry finds herself staring at another
problem Riddick

FRY
And him

JOHNS
Big Evil

FRY

We just keep him locked up forever

JOHNS
Be my choice Already escaped once from
the max-slam facility on --

FRY
I dont need his life story Is he really
that dangerous

JOHNS
Only around humans

Riddick has his mouth on the hull virtually licking the metal
Fry moves closer -- and now sees it sheeting down the hull

FRY
Oh Christ

Theyre losing water Suddenly Fry is running snatching up an
emergency light climbing wall-rungs

INT MACHINE LEVEL - CRASH SHIP - DAY

And crawling through dusty superstructure to reach the water
cistern She opens a crank-hatch -- and finds light invading the
interior Her face dies

ZEKE (VO)
(shouting)
Well Is it just the pump
FRY
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo
Anything to drink

INT CARGO HOLD - DAY

Oversize DOORS RUMBLE open Fry Johns and Paris climb into
this dark corridor lined with cargo containers Each container
has an access door

PARIS
Mine here

As Paris unlocks Johns steadies himself suddenly light-headed

FRY
Smatter

JOHNS
Little swamp-flu from the Conga system
Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep

Paris opens his container to reveal

INT PARIS CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - DAY

Tiffany chairs stacked 10 high Bronze eagle lecterns Oriental
umbrellas Neo-Egyptian castings

JOHNS
King Tuts tomb

PARIS
Be surprised what these will fetch in the
Taurus system Here This Wooten here --
easy easy Very rare

They open the Wooten desk Cubbyholed inside are dusty bottles
of sherry Vintage Port Glenfiddich Bicardi 151

FRY
This is it Booze Thats what you have
to drink
PARIS
(educating her)
200-year-old single-malt scotch is to
booze as foie gras is to duck guts

JOHNS
(cracking a bottle)
A toast to whatever he just said

PARIS
Ill need a receipt for that
(to Fry)
For all these

FRY
Top of my list

She joins Johns for a drink Entering the Chrislams watch with
both envy and aversion

FRY
I dont suppose

IMAM
One of the Christian habits we didnt
adopt -- perhaps unfortunately Well
have to wait

JOHNS

For what There is no water You
understand that dont you

IMAM
All deserts have water somewhere God
shall lead us there

INT MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

START on the cutting torch abandoned in wreckage Staring at it
is

Riddick With his hands cuffed behind him and around a bulkhead
he cant get near it Or can he Near the ceiling the bulkhead
is fractured -- a slim spot where maybe chains could pass
through
Riddick stands With a GRUESOME POPPING he dislocates both
shoulderscarries his arms overheadpasses the chains
through
the broken spotand brings his arms down in front of him A
body-flex POPS HIS SHOULDERS back into joint

Free he reaches for the cutting torch

EXT CRASH SHIP - DAY

Pistol in hand Johns runs into a BIG CLOSEUP eyes sweeping
Nothing on the horizon But something lies on the ground nearby
Its Riddicks mouth-bit

JOHNS
Like we needed another way to die

INT CARGO HOLD - DAY

FAST CLOSEUPS Hands pillaging storage lockers pulling out
anything that might qualify as a weapon It all gets hauled
back and dumped into

INT NAV BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY

Nav-bay Gathered the survivors take inventory Johns has a
pistol shotgun baton Zeke and Shazza offer up a pick-ax
digging tools hunting boomerang Imam shows a ceremonial blade
Paris straggles in with antique curios

JOHNS
What the hell are these

PARIS
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern
India Very rare

ZEKE
An this

PARIS
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New
Guinea Very very rare since the tribes
extinct
ZEKE
Cuz they couldnt hunt shit with these
things be my guess

PARIS
Well whats the need anyway If hes
gone hes gone Why should he bother us

JOHNS
First because he can only live out there
for so long -- hes gonna come back and

take what we got Second for the sheer
thrill of the kill

A beat They all grab for weapons

EXT CRASH SHIP - DAY

Johns stands atop the crash ship scanning with a scope He
fixates on

A blue glow on the horizon What the hell is it

Zeke and Shazza modify breather units adding straps and tubing
and ball-floats The prototype is tested on Audrey She sucks
on the mouthpiece -- and finds that it works supplying oxygen
on

demand rather than in a constant flow

Chrislams convert to traditional bedouin head-gear readying for
travel

Fry finishes wrapping Owens body She looks to the yellow sun
low on the horizon The red sun seems inclined to follow

FRY
Imam We should leave soon Before
nightfall but while its cooler

ZEKE
What youre goin off too

FRY
Johns is leaving you a gun Just do mea
favor huh Get my crewies buried They
were good guys who died bad
SHAZZA
Acourse we will

PILGRIM 1 (OS)
ImamImam

(NOTE Imam is pronounced el-ee-MAM)
Fry and the others round the ship to see

A blue star flaring into view Its rising as the other suns are
setting

SHAZZA
My bloody oath

AUDREY
Three suns
ZEKE
(to Fry)

So much for your nightfall

PARIS
So much for my cocktail hour

IMAM
We take this to be a good sign -- a path
a direction from God

Johns swings down from the top of the ship

JOHNS
A very good sign
(re blue sun)
Thats Riddicks direction You do not
wanna be caught in the dark with this guy

FRY
Thought you found his restraints over
there Toward sunset
JOHNS
(nodding)

Which means he went toward sunrise
EXT PLANET - DAY

Trekking the Chrislams waft incense pots and CHANT FROM

THE KORAN as they head toward the blue star Johns provides
shotgun escort Fry carries Paris second war-pick ona
shoulder

Silhouetted against the alien sky the scouting party is an odd
odd sight

Already sun-battered Johns crafts an eye-visor out of plexi
Fry tries to wrap her head like the Chrislams Imam helps

FRY
So quiet You get used to the sounds of
the ship then

IMAM
You know who Muhammad was

FRY
Some prophet guy

IMAM
Some prophet guy And a city man But
he had to travel to the desert -- where
there was quiet -- to hear the words of
God

FRY

You were on a pilgrimage To New Mecca

IMAM
(nodding)
Chrislam teaches that once in every
lifetime should there be a great hajj --
a great pilgrimage To know God better
yes but to know yourself as well

FRY
Frightening thought

IMAM
(finishes wrapping her)
Were all on the same hajj now

Fry notices Johns scope-locked on something
FRY
What

JOHNS
(hands her scope)
Tell me its not a mirage

SCOPE POV Beyond a distant rise strange branches

FRY
Trees

EXT CRASH SHIP - DAY

Paris has taken over as look-out atop the ship He deals with
the heat by erecting a misting umbrella He fills a reservoir
with liquor dials up a regulator Umbrella spars shoot bursts
of cooling alcohol vapor Paris luxuriates in it

ZEKE (OS)
Comfy up there

Zeke appears below He loads a scrap-metal sled with tarp
cable pick-ax

PARIS
Amazing how you can do without the
essentials of life -- so long as you have
the luxuries

ZEKE

Well just keep your bloody-fuckin eyes
open Dont want that ratbag sneakin up
on me bloody-fuckin arse

He drags the sled toward the spired hills Keeping one eye on
Zeke Paris eases into a chair lays the war-pick across his
lap

pours himself a spot of sherry As he sips a blade touches his
throat

AUDREY
Hed probably get you right here right
under the jaw And youd never hear him
coming Thats how good Riddick is
Paris eases the hunting boomerang away

PARIS
Now did you run away from your parents
Or did they run away from you

EXT BONEYARD OVERLOOK - DAY

The scouting party approaches a rise The trees loom just
beyond

PILGRIMS
Allahu AkbarAllahu Akbar

The young pilgrims break into a excited run anticipating an
oasis But Fry hangs back taking a harder look at the trees
They dont move in the wind

The pilgrims scramble up the rise -- and go motionless Fry
Johns and Imam catch up to behold

The trees are actually the dorsal bones of a titanic skeleton
tinted green by lichen Beyond is a sea of bleached animal
bones Impossibly the bones seem to MOAN IN PAIN All told
its like Hell overflowed right here

FRY
Is this whole planet dead

A pilgrim questions Imam IN ARABIC
IMAM
He asks what could have killed so many
great things
EXT BONEYARD - DAY
Moving into the boneyard
IMAM
Somecommunal graveyard perhaps

like the elephants of Earth

Fry touches one of the towering bones It shows cut-marks --
almost as if the bone was hacked by a sword Graveyard Or
killing field

JOHNS
Long time ago Whatever happened

EXT SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

Pilgrim 1 reaches a huge skull laced with baleen-like combing
Wind hitting the comb makes a LOW HARMONIC MOANING By

moving a hand over the comb the pilgrim can play DIRGELIKE
MUSIC Wanting to show off the trick

PILGRIM 1
Ah

He looks for Pilgrim 3 but cant spot him And when he turns
back to the skull -- a face is staring through the combing But
its only

INT SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

Pilgrim 3 inside the skull Johns enters and chases him out
About to leave Johns notices

Bone-chippings piled on the ground It could be nothing but
still

Johns double-checks shadows probing with the muzzle of his
shotgun Satisfied Johns exits Now BOOM UP to reveal

Riddick Hidden in a sinus cavity

EXT SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

Trailing the others Fry pauses to change out the O02 on her
breather

INT SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

Riddick drops to the ground His arms and hands are now pierced
with shards of boneyard ivory -- fashionable little body talons
Spotting a shadow on the combing he draws closer And sees Fry
Alone
EXT SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

Johns doubles back to Fry He takes a hit of scotch offers her
some

FRY

Probably makes it worse Dehydrates you
even more

JOHNS
Probably right

They drink anyway Moving out of the sun Fry leans up against
the combing It brings her within arms length of

INT SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
Riddick He pulls a bone-shiv freshly chiseled

JOHNS (OS)
You know I woulda played road dog for
these guys You couldve stayed back
Probly shouldve -- because you know
if we dont find water

We may not make it back

FRY (0S)
No no I wanted to get away

JOHNS (OS)
So I noticed Never seen a captain

quite so ready to leave her ship

Just as Riddick eases his blade toward Frys neck

EXT SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
She steps away

FRY
Better keep moving
JOHNS
Whatd Owens mean Bout not touching
the switch

Fry searches his eyes wondering if she can trust him -- and
again she leans back on the combing We can actually see Riddick
now They could too if they would just TURN THE FUCK AROUND

JOHNS (CONTD)
Hey You can tell me Carolyn

FRY
Promise me Swear to me you wont --

JOHNS
You see anybody else here Just between
you and me

FRY
During the landingwhen things were
at their worstOwens was at his best
Hes the one who wouldnt let the pilot
dump the passenger cabin

Johns blinks stunned Are you shittin me

INT SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

Trying again Riddick reaches out with his shiv -- and deftly
slices off some of Frys hair A locket A souvenir Thats
all he wanted

FRY (0S)
So now you know

JOHNS (OS)
Fuck Guess Im more glad to be here than
I thought
Riddick watches them move off -- then looks at the scotch
bottle

left behind Its still got one good swallow

EXT START OF GAUNTLET - DAY
Leaving the boneyard the scouting party reaches a cleft in the
hills Ahead is a canyon

JOHNS
Hold up

He jumps onto a rock puts the scope to an eye

JOHNS (CONTD)
Didnt bite

FRY
What

JOHNS
Thought he might be coolin it in the
boneyard -- could either double-back to

the ship or slip in behind us So I left
the bottle out as bait

SCOPE POV PANNING the boneyard FINDING the bottle Its
still got that one swallow

JOHNS (CONTD)
But nah Didnt bite
EXT BONEYARD - DAY
CLOSER on the bottle Only we see that the scotch has been
emptied -- and replaced with sand
EXT GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

Working under the shade of a tarp Zeke digs a communal grave
Three wrapped corpses wait nearby He keeps a sight-line on

The crash ship Shazza waves Zeke waves back

EXT RIBCAGE - THE GAUNTLET - DAY

The scouting party transits a narrowing canyon Lined with rib
bones it makes us feel like were in the belly of some beast

Fry squints at the ridgetops More of those spires are visible
on the canyon rims looming like silent sentinels What are
they Just mineral deposits

PILGRIM 1
Captaincaptain

The Chrislams have found what appears to be a small desert
plant

Leathery petals are spread wide revealing a round stringy core
ARABIC DISCUSSION Desert fruit Is it edible

FRY
Wait wait wait

Fry takes the plant pushes the petals back down over the
core They all stare Its a baseball

IMAM
We are not alone here yes

They look ahead wondering what awaits them But Johns is
looking back

JOHNS
Never thought we were
EXT SETTLEMENT - DAY

HIGH ANGLE An old WEATHER COCK CREAKS in the wind Fry
Johns and the Chrislams enter FRAME far below

PILGRIM 1
Assalamoo ahlaykum

The GREETING ECHOES through the settlement built from stacked
shipping containers Tattered sun-shades flap in the wind A
rusty bike lies on the ground

PILGRIM 2
Assalamoo ahlaykum

JOHNS
Long gone Whoever they were

They move around a building -- and pull up short Before them
looms a moisture-recovery unit a hulking machine in disrepair
Old jugs litter the ground

IMAM
Waterwater there was here

PILGRIMS
Allahu Akbar

IMAM
(translating)
God is Great yes

JOHNS
Im born-again

Fry manages a weary smile -- but soon her eyes revisit the
abandoned buildings Who were these people Why did they

leave so much behind

INT MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

Through a window we see the Johns and the Chrislams crawling
over the moisture-recovery unit assessing repairs PULL BACK to
include Fry inside the settlement inspecting

Refectory table Place settings out Years of dust

Photos on the wall Settlers working modest gardens Playing
baseball Posing with children

INT LIVING QUARTERS - SETTLEMENT - DAY
Fry enters a dark room

FRY
Lights

No response to her command She pats around for old-style wall
switches Nothing Perceiving black-out blinds on a window she

throws them open to reveal

A man standing right outside

JOHNS
(through window)
Hey Dont go too far huh

Fry nods Johns smiles leaves Just as her heart settles
SOMETHING CREAKS behind her

Its an orrery a mechanical device that shows the motion of the
planets around their suns Solar powered the orrery starts
turning CREAKING One planet seems always to have sunlight

FRY

No darkness No lights because no

darkness
EXT PORCH - SETTLEMENT - DAY
Fry reaches a porch It looks out over the rear of the
settlement and more unforgiving terrain She starts back
inside -- but something glints at the edge of her vision Fry
turns backparts clothes on a laundry lineand sees the
source of the glint
Excited hits on her breather
Fry vaults off the porch -- and starts walking as if on magnetic
bearing Soon shes running

EXT SETTLEMENT - DAY

FRY (VO)
Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar

Johns and the Chrislams trade looks

EXT SKIFF - DAY

FRY
Allahu Akbar

Fry stops on a groomed runway out of breath The others catch
up They too marvel at

The skiff a light-duty vehicle of hybrid technology -- part
bush
plane part space craft Its fabric wings are wind-torn -- but
the hull looks intact

EXT TOP OF CRASH SHIP - DAY
CLOSE on caviar being added to toast-points

A SCRABBLING SOUND stops Paris in mid-bite He eases out of his
rocker moves to the rear edge of the ship and looks down on

A shadow ducking under him Small rocks still trickle down a
dirt rampart just climbed bysomeone

PARIS
This now qualifies as the worst fun Ive
ever had Stop it

No response

EXT CRASH SHIP - DAY

War-pick in hand Paris eases to ground-level He checks the
perimeter looks inside the ship Nobody Is he being fucked
with Again He hopes

passing outside Someone

No answer Audrey springs to the other side of hold puts an eye
to a crack there

starts toward the ship

Paris goes bloodless Shazza grabs the war-pick out of his
frozen hands moves catlike to the main doors and poises there
ready to strike Audrey follows with the hunting boomerang

All eyes watch as

The sun-blades winking off and on chart Riddicks approach
We feel like were inside a magicians sword box watching the
blades shave closer and closer to us Suddenly he appears

And Shazza swings hard

AUDREY
No

Facing them is a TOTAL STRANGER -- burned half naked one hand
still clutching the emergency-release lever of his cryo-locker
Shazza stopped one inch short of killing him

TOTAL STRANGER
I thoughtmy God I thought I was the
only one who
He lurches toward Shazza trying to embrace her -- and sees
blood
and brain-bits BLAM-BLAMMING against her His own The stranger
sinks bonelessly to the ground FAST RACK to reveal Zeke in the
background pistol leveled He reads Shazzas horrified face --
and understands what hes done

It was just somebody else From the
crash He was just

pot -- just to the left of the spine

ourth lumbar down The abdominal aorta

so I used it to catch a little run-off
Metallic taste to it human blood
Coppery But if you cut it with
peppermint schnapps that goes away
Course thats more for winter

Smny
Summertime I take mine straight

Fry stares Riddick gets a black satisfaction from his role as

Boogeyman If fear is the only kind of respect he can get
Riddick is going to grab some with both hands

FRY
Why dont we try the truth now

A head-shaking beat then

RIDDICK
All you people are so scared of me --
an most days Id take that as a
compliment -- but it aint me you gotta
worry about now

FRY
Show me your eyes

Again he turns away She strips the goggles off He sits with
lids shut tight anticipating the pain

FRY
Show me Riddick

Imagine a virgin undressing in front of someone for the first
time Thats how Riddick opens his eyes startling us No
irises just huge black-pool pupils And from deep within a
jewel-like eyeshine His eyes are as beautiful and unsettling
those of a starved jaguar

FRY
You did this To yourself

RIDDICK
Slam doctor Well we called him doctor

Fry slow-turns toward the sound

Q

LICK-CLICK-CLICK

Theres something here something just beyond the cusp of light
Something unfolding

An icy hand grips her heart Soundlessly Fry backtracks her
chain but

Something shadows across the exit It stops her cold

Her hand finds something new She angles it to the light Its
one of Zekes boots -- with a bit of Zeke still in it

CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLICKITY

The whole chamber is coming alive around her shadows unfurling
skulking the perimeter circling

Something impales the boot out of her hand reclaiming it It
was faster than a lightning-strike

springing straight up into

She moves closer Rummages through his stuff brazenly Finds a
shitload of red shells with the hidden ampules

JOHNS
You have a little caffeine in the morning

I have a little morphine So what

FRY
He catches her hands -- and moves them around his body
her into an embrace
of her hands

OS

And here you got two mornings every day
Wow were you born lucky

JOHNS
Not a problem unless youre gonna make --

FRY
(lashing)
You made it a problem when you let Owens
die like that When you had enough drugs
to knock out a fucking mule-team

JOHNS
Owens was already dead His brain just
hadnt caught on to that fact

FRY
Anything else we should know about you
Johns Christ here I am lettin you play
games with our lives when --

JOHNS

My first run-in with Riddick Went for
the sweet-spot and missed They had to
leave a piece of the shiv in there I can
feel it sometimes pressing against the
cord

(giving her hands back)
So maybe the care and feeding of my
nerve-endings is my business

FRY
You coulda helped And you didnt

forcing

We understand why when we see a CLOSEUP
They find a jagged purple scar beside his spine

we hear the Chrislams JABBERING ARABIC and calling for
Captain Captain

JOHNS
Yeah well look to thine own ass first
Right captain

It cuts deep
EXT SETTLEMENT - DAY

Fry and Johns move outside The others have gathered all eyes
gang-locked on

An arch in the sky Luminous ominous it grows from the
horizon

PARIS
What do my eyes see

FRY
Its starting

They watch hypnotically as the arch rises inching toward the
two

suns Shazza shakes out of the trance first

SHAZZA
(to Fry)
If we need anything from the crash ship --
I suggest we kick on That sand-cats

They turn back to see the rim of a giant planet Its cresting
over the horizon The luminous arch is the planets rings
EXT RIBCAGE - THE GAUNTLET - DAY

The sand-cat storms through the canyon As it passes through the
masSive ribcage

The ROLL CAGE SMASHES OUT some low-bridge bones

EXT CRASH SHIP - DAY

The sand-cat reaches the crash ship Bodies leap off Paris
steals a look at

The rising planet It threatens to blot out suns sky universe

INT BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY

Johns yanks the first power cell and starts dragging it over the
deck Riddick yanks a second cell and carrying it on his
shoulder passes Johns with a suck-my-ass grin Johns shoulders
his cell and stumbles after

EXT CRASH SHIP - DAY

Shazza wheels the sand-cat around getting clearance between it
and the ship

The Chrislams lash a scrap-metal sled to the sand-cat

Riddick drops the first cell onto the sled Johns the second
Theyre racing the eclipse and each other
EXT SKY - DAY TO DUSK

As the rings of the planet eclipse the yellow sun

But Paris cant help himself He squints to see

EXT SPIRED HILLS - DUSK

EXT SKY - DUSK

As the rings eclipse the red sun

EXT CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK

A second darkness sweeps over the survivors Now they all stop
beholding

EXT SPIRED HILLS - DEEP DUSK

Something pouring from the spire-tops Backlit by coronal light
it first seems to be smoke or ash -- but soon we realize these
are living things HATCHLINGS SQUEALING IN DELIGHT over their
first nightfall

EXT CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK

JOHNS
Jesus how many can there
They keep coming filling the sky with thick waves Mercifully
the hatchlings seem to be moving away But now one wave cleaves

from another -- and does a quick about-face
PARIS
Just a suggestion but perhaps we should
flee
FRY

Cargo hold everyone in the cargo hold
lesgo lesgo lesgo

They run Reach the cargo hold Turn back to see

Riddick and Shazza still coming Hearing the SQUEALING WAVE

descending on them

Riddick and Shazza hit to the dirt Hatchlings torrent just

inches overhead

CLOSE on Shazza Horrified Hard to breathe Like being
underwater

CLOSE on Riddick He watches in awe no more frightened that a
kid lying on his back looking up at the stars Experimenting
eases a bone-shiv into the hatchlings Instantly its whittled

down to nothing Its like a river of razor blades

The hatchling keep coming Shazza whips a panicky look at the

cargo hold Can she make it Should she even try

AUDREY
Tell her to stay there Stay down
SHAZZA JUST STAY DOWN

Shazza starts worming toward the cargo hold Suddenly the
hatchings vanish A beat Is it safe Shazza gets to her
feet

FRY
No no NO NO NO

and the wave is back enveloping Shazza

Standing in the mouth of the cargo container the others get a
last glimpse of Shazza as she flies by the doors caught up in
the funnel-cloud of hatchlings Then shes simply gone

EXT CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK

Still on the ground Riddick checks left and right like someone
about to cross a busy street Now he gets up smacks his hands
clean strolls for the hold Behind him

A rising GANG-CLICKING

CLOSE on Fry She knows the sound better than anyone

EXT SPIRED HILLS - DEEP DUSK

The spires are crumbling torn down from within

EXT CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK

Reaching the cargo hold Riddick turns around for one last look
PUSH IN as he sheds goggles -- and looks at the world with his
jaguar eyes

RIDDICKS POV In degraded image we see the predators -- adult
hatchlings -- emerge from the spires Theyre large mammalian
hammer-headed They CLICK with echo-location sounding out the

world they havent inhabited in 60 years

FRY
What is it Whats happening

RIDDICKS POV The predators launch from the hills gliding
SOUNDING searching

RIDDICK

about

EXT SKY - DEEP DUSK TO NIGHT

The rim of the planet overtakes both suns The world goes dark
INT CARGO HOLD - NIGHT
Vault-like DOORS BOOM CLOSED

The survivors are locked inside the only secure part of the
ship

Somehow theyve been reduced to neanderthals huddling in their
cave listening to the howls of the sabertooths

AUDREY
What ifwhat if shes still out there
still alive

JOHNS
Well I dont want to jump to conclusions
herebut member that boneyard These
just might be the fuckers that killed
every other living thing on this planet
okay Chances of Shazza knockin on that
door anytime soon are just about zero
squared

FRY
(agreeing)
I saw the cut-marks on the bones Wasnt
a natural die-off

IMAM
Quiet please Everyone

Imam is listening at the cargo door The others pile up
alongside ears tuned like radar CLICKING SWEEPS PAST outside

AUDREY
(whispering)
Why do they do that Make that sound

IMAM
Perhaps the way they see With sound
reflecting back

FRY
(realizing)
Echo-location Thats what it is

Now MORE CLICKING -- behind them Lights whip around to find
Nothing Only the door of an open container about halfway down
the tunnel-like hold

A volley of looks How the fuck could one get in here

FRY
Breach in the hull I dunno

More CLICKING Johns realizes they expect him to check it out

JOHNS
Id rather piss glass

RIDDICK
Well you got the big gauge

JOHNS
Wanna rag your fat mouth

AUDREY
Maybe its just their beads again Imam
are you still --

IMAM
No no no I do not believe --

JOHNS
Cmon man youre drivin everybody
bugfuck with those things Why dont you
just lose the goddamn
More CLICKING -- along with the sound of TOPPLING CARGO

RIDDICK
Big beads

Butching up Johns sucks on his breather and shimmies toward
The open container Leading with his shotgun he FIRES blindly
around the door Something SQUEALS -- then silence Johns eases
his head and a light around the door to spot

Hatchlings on the ground blasted into dog food

JOHNS
(to others)
Okay Were okay Just some small ones
that musta --

Something WHOOSHES for his head swinging like a scythe It
catches his shotgun DISCHARGING IT giving us

A flash-image of an adult predator Up close
In one thin second Johns is back with the others

JOHNS
Very big beads

PARIS
Not staying in here another

He goes for the main-door lever ready to flee into the night
Fry lunges for him

FRY
Christ you dont know whats out there

PARIS
I know whats in here

IMAM
Everybody come this way and we should be
safe Hurry please

INT FIRST CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

Imam shepherds them into a container The door slams closed
At first only the sound of MOUTHS SUCKING BREATHERS Then a
SCRATCHING

Johns fumbles with a cutting torch Gets it burning Adjusts
the gasses to illuminate

The door Scythe-like blades are probing joints Suddenly HEAVY
BLOWS drive everyone back

RIDDICK
(to Johns)
Can you do sumpin else with that
Sides holding it in my fucking face
Taking the hint Johns starts cutting the common wall between
containers Its a race between the sparks of his cutter and the
blades of the predators

INT SECOND CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

An burn-outline appears in the common wall Johns kicks out the
escape hatch Audrey speed-crawls through first as

Predators shred into the container right behind them CLICKING
sweeping hunting

just as the predators break into the container being vacated
always entering darkness

NT FIFTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

nside their fifth container now Johns torches away Fry and
Paris use cargo to block the entrance hole -- then block the
cargo with their bodies

Riddick adds his weight -- until he notices pepper-shot in the
cargo Suspecting the worst he leaves the others behind

PARIS
Hello hello

and moves to the front of the container where darkness
prevails Something SQUISHES underfoot He slips off goggles

RIDDICKS POV Of dead hatchlings on the floor This is the
open container the one where Johns found predators

Sensing energy Riddick lifts his face

RIDDICKS POV Of an adolescent predator It squats atop cargo
eating a hatchling A heavy bone-blade crowns its skull
Sensing Riddick it sweeps the area with INQUISITIVE CLICKS
PREDATOR POV Of Riddick

(NOTE The PREDATOR POV is a crude image that gives impression
without detail Were seeing what the predator hears with
echo-location Think of a sonagram that strobes and wraps its
subject in 3-D space)

Oblivious the others kick out the new escape hatch Audrey
Fry and Johns worm through Imam and Pilgrim 2 hang back
Wheres Riddick

Hes in a stare-down with a predator

Searching Pilgrim 2 rounds a corner -- and finds his head
caught in a vice-like grip

RIDDICK
Dont Move

RIDDICKS POV As a second predator appears above them This
one reaches down with its scythe blade

And gently probes the two men It wants know what theyre made
of

CLOSE on the pilgrims shoes Over-running with piss

More blades descend moving over them like surgical instruments
One test-slices Riddicks shirt

stopped Losing his nerve he bolts

RIDDICK
No

The predators are on him just blurs in the dark DEATH-SCREAM

RIDDICKS POV A third predator appears above him

Making his move Riddick darts around cargo and heads for the
escape hatch as

Frys light catches him square in the face Blinded Riddick
HOWLS and stumbles forward Frys light leaps deeper to hit

The predator right behind him With a similar reaction the
beast HOWLS and flails back

HOLD on Fry for a time-stopped moment What stopped it Was it
really her Suddenly a SHOTGUN EXPLODES beside her head Jacked
up Johns is BLASTING shadows

FRY
Stop it stop it STOP IT

JOHNS
Sokay sokay I killed it

They give him a look Sure you did Suddenly a CARCASS SLAMS
to the floor sending everyone jumping back in a perfect splash-
pattern Christ he did kill one

Fry reclaims her dropped light and beams it on the carcass
Wherever the light strikes it the flesh chars and steams

FRY
There

PARIS
Like the light is scalding it
FRY
It hurts them Light actually hurts
them

VULTURE SOUNDS from the two 0S adolescents fighting over the
scraps of the pilgrim

Riddick nods

JOHNS
Well burn a candle for him later Cmon

INT SIXTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

more

Spirits Anything over 45 proof burns
well

FRY

How many bottles

PARIS
Not sure Ten

FRY
Those umbrellas the ones that mist
Would they burn
(reading his face)
If you got a receipt

PARIS
Possibly
FRY
Awright So maybe well have enough light

JOHNS
Enough for what

Now she challenges him to be the mind-reader

JOHNS (CONTD)
Oh lady If youre in your right mind
I pray you go insane

FRY
(to others)
We can stick to the plan If we get four
cells back to the skiff were off this
rock

PARIS
I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an
ugly fact but that sand-cat wont run at
night

FRY
Well have to carry the cellsdrag
themwhatever it takes

Troubled faces Is it just our imagination Or is the light on
the floor growing dimmer

AUDREY
You meantonight With all those things
still out there

PARIS
Oh sure Why not Sounds like a hoot

JOHNS
Back it up How long can this last Few
minutes Couple hours

No one knows for sure

IMAM
I had the impressionfrom the model
that the two planets were moving as one
That there would bea lasting darkness
JOHNS
Those suns gotta come back sometime And
if these animals really are phobic about
light we just sit tight till then

FRY
Im sure thats what someone else said
Locked inside that coring room

A persuasive thought Eyes swing back to Audrey

JOHNS
Look we gotta think about everyone now --
the kid especially How scared is she
gonna be out there

FRY
Oh dont use her like that for a smoke
screen

JOHNS

Smoke screen for what

FRY
For your own fear

JOHNS
(eyes narrowing)
Hey Why dont you rag your hole for two
seconds and let someone else come up with
a plan that doesnt involve MASS SUICIDE

Two seconds pass

FRY
How much you weigh Johns

JOHNS
What the hells it matter

FRY
How much

JOHNS
79 kilos
FRY
Because youre 79 kilos of gutless white
meat and thats why you cant come up
with a better plan

He makes a move for her Riddick blocks Johns shotgun bumps
the underside of Riddicks chin

RIDDICK
Think about that reward Johns

JOHNS
Im willing to take a cut in pay

RIDDICK
How bout a cut in your gut
Johns looks down CAMERA DROPS to reveal the shiv Riddick holds
poised for evisceration

JOHNS
Oh Trash Baby youre gonna regret this

IMAM
Pleasethis solves nothingplease

Johns backs off first The light grows dimmer

FRY
(to Audrey)
Theyre afraid of our light That means
we dont have to be so afraid of them

IMAM
And youre certain you can find the way
back Even in the dark

No Im not But he can

Shes pointing of course to Riddick

into the back of Riddicks neck

Were not alive because of her -- were
alive in spite of her

JOHNS
Like who Mr Chrislam

EXTREMELY TIGHT on both men In their eyes we see the new
partnership splintering apart Like Mr Johns

Riddick makes a play for the shotgun It BLASTS skyward

EXT BONEYARD - NIGHT
As the fight erupts

FRY
Bring the light

AUDREY

FRY
Leave the sled lets go go go

EXT BONEYARD - NIGHT

FIGHT SCENE Johns light hits the ground creating an arena of
illumination FAST CLICKING nearby Still struggling Riddick
and Johns somehow manage to gang-aim the shotgun and BLAST THE
CLICKING AWAY

The shotgun goes free Johns lunges for it but Riddick kicks it
into the night And then pulls his shiv
RIDDICK
Gotta stay in the light Johns Thats
the only rule

Johns circles inside the light Fucking with him Riddick starts
poking and jabbing backing him up against the wail of dark
Johns stumbles over something A bone A club

Riddick finds his own bone-club and now they go at it like two
cavemen Riddick beats on Johns club-hand breaking fingers
forcing him to drop the bone Just trying to get away now Johns
makes a desperate lunge for the light but

Riddick shivs open his back

RIDDICK
Remember that moment

Gushing blood Johns starts crawling pathetically with the
light
Riddick dogs him

RIDDICK
Shoulda never took the chains off Johns
You were one brave fuck before Now look
at you Oh yeah you were Billy Bad-ass
with your gaugewith your chains

Johns finds the shotgun And Im still Billy Bad-ass He
sweeps it around with the light ready to kill

Blackness Whered Riddick go
CLICKING behind Johns He whirls to see
Something big coming for him Johns BLASTS IT back into the

night dropping the light as he does Eyes in the back of his
head he whirls again and takes aim on

Another bull-rushing predator

Johns triggers a bad round Crazed he ratchets and levels the
shotgun for another try Hes too late

BIG CLOSEUP as the ejected shell rolls to a stop Its red
Johns loaded a morphine shell in the dark
RIDDICKS POV With Johns skewered by the armpits the predator
lifts him off the ground and stares with a deceptively gentle
CLICKING-COOING SOUND

PREDATORS POV Of Johns final expression
RIDDICKS POV The predator rears back its head -- then slams
£

orward hitting Johns with the full force of its skull-blade
plitting him in two

And crashes into Riddick He was just standing in the dark

BLACK SCREEN We hear the canyon in full cry now -- CLICKING
BATTLING BONE-BLADESMATING CRIESthe RENDING OF FLESH

and SNAPPING OF TENDON Far below twin flames appear as the
survivors reach the gauntlet Predators perch in FOREGROUND
just hulking silhouettes watching from a canyon rim

EXT START OF GAUNTLET - NIGHT
They are but five Fry Riddick Audrey Imam and Pilgrim 1
CLOSE on each face as they listen to the CANYON There must be

countless predators ahead

FRY
How many you see

RIDDICK
One or two

FRY
Audrey

AUDREY
Three full bottles But almost time to
refill

FRY
Doesnt seem like enough to turn back on
does it

RIDDICK

Only see one way Turn the sled over and
drag it like that girl down low Light
up everything we got -- and run through
like dogs on fire

A beat

IMAM
(understanding)
The sled as a shield

FRY
And what about the cells

RIDDICK
Ill take those

She looks at him hard

Were just here

RID

DICK

Riddick shrugs into the harness snugs it down
RIDDICK (CONTD)

Cuz you dont spend half your life in
lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth
and not believe And you surely dont
start out in a liquor store trash bin with
an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck
and not believe Oh absolutely I believe
in God And I absolutely hate the fucker

IMAM
He will be with us Nonetheless

RIDDICK
Give my blessing to the girl She needs
a spare

EXT START OF GAUNTLET - NIGHT
The torches Maxed out Burning non-stop

Fry and Imam Sled chains on Lapping up O02 Each holding a
torch

Pilgrim 1 Clutching a handlight

Audrey Rolling under her sled-shield becoming the turtle in a
metal carapace

Riddick Goggles on He has no desire to see what horrors will
surround them Theres just one path anyway Straight through

RIDDICK
As fast as you can

FRY
You sure you can keep --

RIDDICK
As fast as you can

EXT THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
SLEW OF SHOTS Fry and Imam on the move dragging the shield

fast Audrey speed-crawling beneath Pilgrim 1 tripping along
behind the shield And Riddick behind them all face already
tortured pulling 200 pounds of stubborn-mule cargo -- yet
somehow keeping pace The torch flames stretched by the wind
flank them in fire

EXT CANYON RIM - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

As predators launch from the rim

EXT THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

First come the hatchlings streaming right into their faces --
then veering away at the last second repulsed by light Next
come FERAL SOUNDS overhead

RIDDICK
Dont look

Thin blue liquid spatters them

RIDDICK
Do not look up

More spattering Fry looks up -- and stumbles when she
beholds

A ceiling of predators At the cusp of light they dive and
weave and dart slashing each other in a rabid desire to SOUND
OUT the humans below Its like looking into a bucket of angry
eels

RIDDICK
Keep going keep going keep going
keep going

His voice whips them like the Devils coxswain Chastened Fry
keeps her eyes down and speed up

More blue blood showers down -- followed by entrails dropping
out of the sky Could this be Hell itself

IMAM
(a muttered mantra)
So dark the clouds around my way
I cannot see
But through the darkness I believe
God leadeth me

I gladly place my hand in His when
all is dim

And closing my weary eyes lean
hard on him

Now WHOLE CORPSES ARE CRASHING DOWN around them victims

of in-fighting Fry and Imam start slaloming through the ghastly
mess

Pilgrim 1 passes too close to a corpse A blade slices his leg
drawing blood He keeps his mouth shut

EXT CHOKE-POINT - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

The passage narrows into a choke-point Fry sees it first

FRY
Riddick RIDDICK

Ahead a clot of dead predators blocks the canyon

AUDREY
What What is it

RIDDICK
Its a fucking staircase Go over it
GO OVER IT

Steeling themselves they start climbing

But Audrey on all fours has to discover the corpses with her
hands Then taking exception at being walked on

One corpse snaps at her Audrey recoils sideways

And tumbles down the mound of corpses Shes exposed

PREDATORS POV Rapid-fire images of Audrey Flashes from 10
different predators

FRY
Audrey

Audrey shakes out of it and scrambles for the shield just as
A predator kamikazes onto the shield its bone-blades piercing
the metal

And nearly skewering Audrey beneath

Caught in torchlight steaming the PREDATOR HOWLS as it tries
to rip free of the shield

Beneath Audrey hangs on and takes a thrashing
The predator tears clear spins pounces blindly at
Riddick standing at lights edge Stunningly he catches the

beast under its scythe blades blunting the attack The predator
CLICKS MADLY at him

PREDATORS POV Of Riddicks face

The predator rears back its head ready to bisect Riddick with
its skull-blade

Switchblade fast Riddick drops a hand
yanks his shiv

and sweeps it over the belly of the beast HOWLING the
predator falls disemboweled

REACTION SHOTS of Fry and Imam Stunned

RIDDICK
Didnt know who he was fuckin with

They regroup Imams head swivels back and forth Theyre one
person short

IMAM
Suleiman

RIDDICK
Get the girl back under Keep going

IMAM
SULEIMAN

RIDDICK
KEEP GOING OR I WILL
Suddenly Pilgrim 1 reappears thrust back into the light by
unseen forces Hes still alive -- but shouldnt be He makes
a feeble attempt to grab onto Imam to anyone but hes gone
again before they can even react jerked out of the light Out
of existence

EXT THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

They flail on And now finallyfinally

The canyon widens opening up like some door to Heaven The
WORST SOUNDS fall behind We can see it in their sweat-sheened
faces The faintest hope that maybe theyve survived the Seventh
Circle of Hell But then

The TORCHES SPIT AND SPUTTER

Audrey hears PATTERING on the metal shield

Blood falls anew

One torch dies -- yet somehow comes back to life

Imam upturns a hand checking the liquid for color But this
blood has no hue

FRY
Oh no No no no

IMAM
Rain
EXT THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
RAIN MONTAGE Water rilling running flowing over rocks and
ground

Caught in a downpour the survivors slog to a stop One torch
goes out -- and wont relight

RIDDICK
So where the hells God now huh
(no answer from Imam)

Ill tell you where Hes up there

PISSING ON ME

FRY

Riddick sheds goggles to look ahead We dont know what he
sees -- nor what hes thinking

FRY
Tell me the settlement is right there

Somewhere behind the AWFUL SOUNDS RETURN

RIDDIC
Herehide here

Hes found a crevice in the canyon wall

RIDDIC

EXT CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

They crawl into the fissure The second torch dies behind them

Theres just one light left now -- the one Riddick wears on his

back By its glow we watch him lift the shield muscle it over
to the crevice

Frys not sure Is he protecting them Or entombing them

EXT MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

Working like Sisyphus Riddick hauls the cells up a muddy rise
He stops at the top peers through the rain

RIDDICKS POV Of the settlement

Riddick disappears over the rise The four cells follow
slithering through the mud like a serpents tail

EXT CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

AUDREY
Hes not coming back is he

Fry checks Imams face Did Riddick say anything to you Imam
wags his head A bleak beat -- before Fry realizes she can see
his face

FRY
Theres light in here

Its a soft glow from above Imam climbs higher to discover
small blue-white lights clinging to rocks He plucks a few

FRY
What are they

CLOSE on the lights in Imams palm They writhe with life

IMAM
Larva

AUDREY
Glow worms

FRY

(mind racing)
How many bottles we got Empty ones

Riddick boards the dark craft
Connects the power cells to the battery bay

Watches the ship come to life

CLOSE on a liquor bottle Its half full of glow-worms

AUDREY
More more we need more

They climb higher Little by little the bottle brightens their
world

EXT SKIFF - NIGHT

Drenched in light Riddick stands in the hatchway of the skiff
looking out into dark rain Is he struggling with a decision
Or just savoring the safe harbor Then very deliberately
Riddick smashes his handlight on the hull He steps inside and
closes the hatch behind him

EXT MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

Something claws its way up the rise Standing we see that its
Fry a bottle of glow-worms strung around her neck Ahead she

Audrey and Imam huddle around a bottle of glow-worms This is
all they could harvest Presently SCRABBLING SOUNDS on the
shield Imam eases one eye to a small hole in the shield He
cant see much until

A blade rushes through the hole Imam recoils hard snatches up
the glow-worm light to see

More predator blades exploring the edges of the shield The
light drives them away For now
INT SKIFF - NIGHT

Riddick dims interior lights activates exterior lights Hes
actually startled by the sight of

Fry Standing in the skiffs headbeams Daring him to run her
over

Eye-lock

Riddick opens the hatch

EXT SKIFF - NIGHT

They meet at opposite ends of the gangway -- Fry in the rain
Riddick in the light

RIDDICK
Strong survival instinct Admire that in
a woman

FRY

Youre not leaving Not until we go back
for the others
He laughs at that

FRY (CONTD)
I promised them wed go back with more
light And thats exactly what were
gonna do

RIDDICK
Think youve mistaken me for somebody who
gives a fuck

FRY
What youre afraid

RIDDICK
Confusin me with Johns now -- fear was
his monkey I only deal in life and
death All that stuff in between Some
shade of grey my eyes dont see

FRY
I trusted you Riddick Goddamn I
trusted that some part of you wanted to
rejoin the human race

RIDDICK
Truthfully I wouldnt know how

Fry realizes its impossible to shame a shameless man With
desperation edging her voice

FRY
Then wait for me Ill go back myself
Just give me more light for them

He tosses her a light The broken one

FRY
Just come with me

RIDDICK
Got a better idea Come with me

Frys mouth moves but nothing comes out

RIDDICK (CONTD)
Theyre already dead Get on board

FRY
Youre fuckin with me I know you are

A beat She takes his hand -- and jerks him down the gangway

They sprawl through mud She gets a knee on his neck

FRY
I will not give up on them I Will not
leave anyone on this rock with those
fucking things even if it means --

In a blur Riddick rolls and slaps a shiv on her neck Is
history repeating itself Riddicks face though is strangely
calm Curious Even gentle

RIDDICK
Youd die for them

FRY
I would try for them

RIDDICK
You barely know them

FRY
But Im human I know you view that as a
weakness but Im sorry -- I do feel fear

A predator drinks there

RIDDICK
(on his breath)
Doesnt see uswait for it to leave

Their backs are to us but the pool is turning into a major
gathering place

Soon they all can hear CLICKING above the RAIN Their nightmare
is far from over

RIDDICKS POV Of a half-dozen predators shifting places at the
pool A slim gap appears

RIDDICK
When I go we go Full-throttle

CLOSE on their hands gripping each other

A gauntlet within a gauntlet

Riddick runs Linked like paper dolls the others follow
blindly

shoulder

The survivors hit the water like lawn mowers on legs crashing

hrough scattering water and predators alike managing to
reach

ct

The muddy rise Audrey loses her grip on the others

And starts back-sliding She CRIES OUT turning the head of

Riddick He catches Audrey as her legs hit the pool He muscles
her back up the rise and heaves her over the top sending her
slip-sliding down the other side

You know the way

Not waiting for him Fry and Imam disappear over the rise

vanishing around the corner BREATHING LIKE A RACEHORSE we
follow in their steps storming around the same corner Suddenly
a predator is right there right in our face

up

Captain

He wants her to board the skiff Fry gives it another beat eyes
sweeping the dark rain And just when we think its over for
Riddick -- TERRIBLE SCREAMS are heard from both man and
predator

Theres a helluva fight going on out there Close out there

Fry snatches the glow-worms off Imams neck
And plunges into the darkness homing in on the SOUNDS until

A blade flashes in her face She ducks and spots

Riddick Bloody muddy hes down on his knees still trying to
fight off the shadow-beasts that swirl and slash all around him
Around them both

FRY
Its me its me its me

She gets the light around his neck Now we see his face
clearly -- and see a very human expression there Fear Fry
grabs his armpits and tries to pull him up
FRY
Cmon Riddick -- said Id die for them
not you

He gets his feet under him Gripping each other they start
moving turning like dancers in a macabre waltz hoping the
predators cant fix on Riddicks blood

AUDREY
Not sure where to go I was just runnin
away when this whole thing started

RIDDICK
Not sure I was just runnin away when

a course-correction One very bright star comes into view
