EXT MUTT CUTS DOG SALON - DAY

This building is white with black spots on it like a
DALMATION Over the front door is an awning shaped like a
DOGS SNOUT whiskers included A van pulls up outside

The vehicle is decorated like a GIANT POODLE with four legs
hanging off the sides a tail in the rear and a dogs snout
on the front grill MUTT CUTS is written on the side of it

HARRY DUNNE climbs out Hes in his early 30s and dressed in
a ridiculous BEAGLE COSTUME including a CAP WITH FLOPPY
EARS He goes to the rear of the van opens it and a swarm
of DOGS pile out
HARRY
Okay gang single file You know
the rules No pushing no humping
and no sniffing heinies

The door to the shop opens and Harrys annoyed boss MR
PALMER sticks his head out

PALMER
Hey why arent those mutts on
leashes

HARRY

The same reason youre not on a leash
sir because its demeaning and it
chafes like hell

PALMER
Just get them in here now They all
have to be bathed and clipped in an
hour

Palmer disappears back inside Harry CALLS to the dogs but
they pay no attention He struggles to keep them from
wandering off He grabs a couple of SMALL POOCHES and sits
them on a wall

HARRY
You kids stay right here

As he turns to round up the other we discover that the wall
isnt a wall its a flatbed truck The truck drives away
taking the two dogs with it

HARRY (CONTD)
(at truck)
Hey wait a minute

Harry chases after the vehicle

EXT EAST SIDE ESTATE - DAY

Lloyd Christmas pulls the limousine into a long tree-lined
driveway He gets out and looks up in awe at an IMPRESSIVE
STONE MANSION He WHISTLES to himself then walks to the
front oor and RINGS THE BELL

The double-front doors of the mansion open and MARY SWANSON
appears Shes 25 and gorgeous Lloyds jaw drops open when
he lays eyes on her

MARY
Hello

As Mary steps back inside Lloyd takes out a tiny can of
Binaca He sprays his mouth under his arms his hair behind
his ears

CUT TO
INT LIMO - DAY

Lloyd is driving and Mary is in the back looking out the
window lost in thought Shes got a BRIEFCASE resting on
her lap and she fingers the leather nervously Lloyd keeps
glancing at her in the rear-view mirror but for a moment he
is speechless Then

LLOYD
Why you going to the airport Flying

MARY
(dead-pan)

Well I saw your luggage then when
I noticed the airline ticket I put
two and two together
(beat)
So where you heading

Mary looks back out the window and Lloyd sneaks another
glance

LLOYD (CONTD)

to impress her

LLOYD
Uh this isnt my real job you know

selling worm farms you know like
ant farms A lot of people dont
realize that worms make much better
pets than ants Theyre quiet
affectionate they dont bite and
theyre super with the kids

fq

MARY
Arent ants quiet too

Lloyd realizes she has a point

LLOYD
Uh well sure but they arent half
as affectionate And if you cut an
ants head off it wont grow back

MARY
I see
LLOYD
And best of all worm farming is a
seventy-five-thousand-dollar-a-year
industry I wouldnt mind having a
piece of that pie if you know what
I mean

To her credit she doesnt They continue driving Mary looks
at her watch and crosses her legs Lloyd can see that shes
concerned about something

LLOYD (CONTD)
Whats the matter Little tense about
the flight

MARY
(beat)
Something like that

Lloyd SWIVELS AROUND and STARES over his shoulder at her

LLOYD
Its really nothing to worry about
Mary Statistically they say youre
more likely to get killed on the way
to the airport You know like ina
head-on crash or something

MARY

Um Lloyd could please keep your
eyes on the road

LLOYD
Good thinking Theres a lot of bad

rivers out there

Lloyd turns back to the steering wheel

EXT AIRPORT - DAY

Lloyd is putting the last bags on a cart He closes the trunk
and turns to Mary She looks nervous and disconcerted as she
reaches into her purse She pulls out a ten-dollar tip

MARY
Here you go

LLOYD

For the first time Mary Swanson offers a slight smile This
makes her more lovely than ever

LLOYD (CONTD)
Relax Mary Just get trashed and
pass out Youll be there before you

MARY
Thanks Lloyd
(beat)

And good luck with your worms

Then she PICKS UP HER BRIEFCASE and walks into the terminal
followed by a PORTER pushing her bags Lloyd watches her
ENCHANTED until shes out of sight

Afterwards he climbs back into the limo LOVESICK For a
moment he doesnt even have the energy to turn the key He
just drops his head against the steering wheel DEVASTATED
Theres a TAP on the window Lloyd looks up to see a POLICE
OFFICER standing there

POLICE OFFICER
Come on move it youre in a red
zone

Lloyd starts the limo and pulls away
CUT TO
INT AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

Mary looks tense as she moves through the throngs of
travelers Her pace is slow deliberate and her eyes are
focused straight ahead

She passes a row of phone botths and two MEN one dressed in
an ARMANI SUIT the other in a PLAID SPORTCOAT watch her

ARMANI SUIT
Shes gonna leave the briefcase at
the foot of the escalator You make
the pick-up

PLAID SPORTCOAT
Piece of cake
EXT AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY
As Lloyd pulls his limo slowly away he glances in the airport
window and SEES MARY

WALKING ALONG

When she stops at the foot of the escalator he stops too
She puts down the briefcase and checks her coat pocket for
her ticket Lloyds attention is distracted by a HONK He
turns to see a car irectly behind him

LLOYD
(to cars driver)
Drive around me you pinhead

When he turns back to watch Mary in the terminal he sees
that SHES GONE and shes LEFT HER BRIEFCASE AT THE FOOT OF
THE STAIRS Lloyd jumps to ATTENTION

He pulls the car into a HANDICAPPED SPOT and hops out He
starts to run into the terminal then notices the Police
Officer and suddenly goes into a spastic walk limping and
dragging him leg behind him like a palsy victim

INT AIRPORT TERMINAL

The Armani Man nods to the Plaid Sportcoat and he starts to
approach the briefcase Just as Plaid Sportcoat is reaching
for the handle LLOYD RUNS BY AND GRABS IT He CONTINUES UP
THE ESCALATOR three steps at a time The two men look at
each other dumbstruck

INT AIRPORT TERMINAL - BOARDING GATE

Lloyd runs with the briefcase to the TV monitors that post
the departure times He looks frantically at the confusion
of numbers

LLOYD

QUICK CUT of a dejected Lloyd looking out the window as he
watches as Marys airplane taxiing away

EXT AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

Lloyd comes out with the briefcase passing the two men who
FOLLOW HIM AT A DISTANCE He starts walking down the sidewalk
when suddenly he STOPS IN HIS TRACKS
HIS POV - his limo is being towed away under the supervision
of the Police Officer

He takes off after it but to no avail
LLOYD

As Lloyd watches the limo get towed out of site he runs his
fingers through his hair

both plunk down in their favorite easy chairs (Lloyd still
has the briefcase in his lap) Harrys caged parakeet PETEY
tweets hello but the two guys just sit there SILENTLY

The place is a mess Wallpapers peeling off the walls The
carpet is threadbare and filthy In the corner we see a
miniature WORM FARM and a large terrarium filled with dirt
and worms Here are a couple pieces of haggard furniture
with stuffing spilling out of the gashes

HARRY

Theres a deadly SILENCE as they both think about this Then
Harry tries to lighten the mood He opens his arms wide

HARRY

Harry Maybe we should stay here and
try our luck in bankruptcy court
With all those lawsuits against us

could be a boost to our egos

Harry sees that Lloyd has a point He stands and approaches

Mental puts the phone down and motions the Anxious Man closer
to the booth The Man moves forward a few inches Mental
motions him even closer When hes about a foot away Mental
punches his hand through the glass of the booth and knocks

the Anxious Man out cold Then
Mental picks up the phone again

GROWL They stop in their tracks and turn expecting to see
a dog but there isnt one They both take another step
forward and the GROWL GETS LOUDER AND MEANER Again Mental
and Shay stop He peeks under the car Nothing

SHAY
What the fuck

Finally Shay reaches for the door handle As soon as he
touches it though the car alarm goes off but instead of a
siren its the incredibly annoying sound of a POODLE YAPPING
Mental jumps back and pulls his gun

When he gets it to the door he struggles to lift the engine
on its side finally managing to slip the key into the lock

EXT MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT

Harry is yawning as he pumps the gas Suddenly a Jeep Cherokee
pulls up and a long-legged tanned ATHLETIC BEAUTY climbs
out This seems to wake Harry up

The Athletic Beauty smiles at Harry as she grabs a pump and
starts to fill her jeep Harry makes a feeble attempt to
brush his hair into place then CLEARS HIS THROAT and nods
to the skis on her roof-rack

HARRY
Skis huh

ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Thats right

HARRY
Great

She continues to pump gas

HARRY (CONTD)
They yours

ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Uh-huh

HARRY

ATHLETIC BEAUTY

HARRY
(impressed)
Cool

THE GAS FROM HARRYS NOZZLE STARTS TO OVERFLOW BUT HE DOESNT
NOTICE FROM HER POV IT LOOKS
like a BIG DOG IS PISSING ON HIS LEG

ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Excuse me youre spraying everywhere

Harry turns to see the gas GUSHING ALL OVER HIS SHOES He
immediately removes the nozzle and replaces it on the pump
as she smiles to herself

INT GAS STATION MENS ROOM

Lloyd is standing in a stall urinating He starts to read
the graffiti scrawled on the wall Finally he comes to one
that says FOR A GOOD TIME MEET ME HERE NOVEMBER 8 1993
215

AM SHARP

He frowns at this then looks nervously at his watch
CLOSE UP OF DIAL - the date reads NOVEMBER 8

ZOOM IN on the minute hand as it CLICKS TO EXACTLY 215

Just as a concerned look crosses Lloyds face we hear the
BATHROOM DOOR SQUEAK OPEN AND SLAM SHUT Terrified Lloyd
quickly locks the stall door then crouches on the toilet
bowl so his feet arent visible The sound of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS
approaches the stall and then stops Lloyd looks down to see
a pair of SIZE 16 WORKBOOTS beneath the door We can barely
hear a LOW GROWL Then the stall handle JIGGLES Lloyd holds
his breath The ominous boots MOVE AWAY and Lloyd lets out a
SIGH OF RELIEF

All of a sudden the DOOR IS KICKED IN AND A TOWERING FIGURE
STEPS INTO FRAME Lloyd looks up and GASPS

HIS POV - its the Redneck trucker Sea Bass
SEA BASS
Well well well if it aint my old
friend
(checks watch)

And right on time

As Sea Bass STEPS INTO THE STALL we
CUT TO

EXT MUTT CUTTS VAN - NIGHT
The Athletic Beauty is back in her Jeep now and Harry has
sidled up to the drivers side He leans against her side-
view mirror

HARRY
(re suitcases in
back seat)
Thats a lot of luggage for a little
vacation

ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Actually Im moving to Aspen Ive
got to get away from my boyfriend

Hes such a klutz My astrologer told me I should avoid
accident-prone guys

Just then the side-view mirror Harry has been leaning on
SNAPS OFF THE CAR HE CRACKS

HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WINDSHIELD FALLS TO THE GROUND THEN
QUICKLY LEAPS TO HIS FEET AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED

HARRY
(holding out mirror)
Here this is a little loose

She throws the mirror into the back seat and takes out a
cigarette

HARRY (CONTD)
Allow me

He pulls out a match and lights it with a debonair flourish

The Athletic Beauty nods her thanks Harry tosses the match
to the ground and we hear an OS WHOOSH Wisps of smokes
rise around him and we hear the LOW CRACKLE OF SOMETHING
BURNING (Neither of them notice this)

HARRY (CONTD)
Look um maybe when I get to Aspen
we can meet up you know for hot
chocolate or something

She looks him over and smiles
ATHLETIC BEAUTY

Why not You seem pretty harmless
Ill give you my number Just let me
find a pen

As she starts to rummage through her purse Harry SMELLS THE
SMOKE He looks down and sees that his RIGHT SHOE IS ABLAZE
He shakes it then tries to put it out with the other shoe
but to no avail Meanwhile the Athletic Beauty is still
searching for a pen

ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONTD)
I know I have one here somewhere

Harry starts doing a soft-shoe dance to extinguish the flames
This only helps to fan them

HARRY
(urgently)
Look why dont you just tell it to
me Ive got a good memory

ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Are you sure you wont forget

HARRY
(desperate)
Positive please hurry

He begins hopping around violently

ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Is something wrong

Harry shakes his head no as he bites his lip to keep from
screaming

ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONTD)
Okay my number is 652-2553
(beat)
Oh wait a second thats my old
number Its so funny how your mind
god sakes give me the damn number

Shes taken aback by this outburst
ATHLETIC BEAUTY (CONTD)
Look man if youre gonna get pushy

She throws the car into drive and PEELS AWAY

INT GAS STATION MENS ROOM
Sea Bass has his meaty paw wrapped around Lloyds neck as he
slides him up the wall of the toilet stall

SEA BASS
First Im gonna rape you then Im
gonna kill you Any last request

LLOYD
Um yeah could you do it the other
way around

Sea Bass pushes Lloyd to his knees Then the trucker steps
back and UNDOES HIS FLY The sound of the zipper brings a
green color to Lloyds face

ON THE MENS ROOM DOOR - it bursts open and a FLAME-FOOTED
Harry rushes into the bathroom panic-stricken In his
desperation he PLOWS THROUGH THE STALL DOOR KNOCKING SEA
BASS ON THE HEAD and thrusts his flaming foot into the
toilet

EXTINGUISHING THE FIRE

Harry breathes a DEEP SIGH of relief Only then does he notice
LLOYD ON HIS KNEES AND

SEA BASS UNCONSCIOUS ON THE FLOOR WITH HIS PANTS UNDONE

Harry has to do a DOUBLE-TAKE for this to sink in Then he
lets out an admonishing

terrain Then something starts to awn on him Slowly

HARRY

GOES FLYING and the guys wrestle pitifully with one another
in the snow rolling over and over

Finally Harry manages to get the upper hand He climbs on

her shirt off while Harry happily massages her back

-The guys are in an expensive haberdashery Harry comes out
of the dressing room in a very elegant BLACK TUXEDO He
couldnt look any more suave The SALEMAN nods impressed
but Lloyd shakes his head no and Harry goes back in

-Harry reappears in another stylish WHITE TUXEDO The Salesman
looks on hopefully but Lloyd again disapproves

-This time Harry comes out in a JUNIOR-PROM-LIKE SKY-BLUE
TUXEDO complete with TACKY FRILLS The Salesman looks
sickened as Lloyd give Harry the thumbs up

PAN ACROSS THE STREET from the haberdashery - an apprehensive

make their way to the bar

LLOYD

As Harry and Lloyd silently take in the party a BEAUTIFUL

RED HEAD reaches between them for a cocktail napkin

Harry raises his eyebrows IMPRESSED

then

LLOYD (CONTD)
And I would say shut up because
this is our chance to get in with
the rich and powerful and you dont
ingratiate yourself to the kind of
people by acting like Ron Jeremy on
Spanish Fly

The Bartender delivers their martinis as we hear the os
CLINKING of a glass The guys turns to

see Nicholas Andre standing at a podium Next to him is a
LARGE COVERED DISPLAY On his other side are Karl and
Elizabeth Swanson

ANDRE
If I could have your attention

The crowd QUIETS
ANDRE (CONTD)
Id like to thank you all for coming
to this very special event As you

KNOW THE ASPEN PRESERVATION SOCIETY -

founded and chiefly funded by our great benefactors Karl
and Helen Swanson - is the worlds foremost efender of
endangered species Our

SPRAWLING GROUNDS ARE HOME TO TWENTY-

three separate varieties of animals that are currently listed
on the United Nations charter of protected species Tonight
we are deeply honored to have Mr Karl Swanson welcome our
twenty-fourth

The crowd CLAPS as Mr Swanson takes Andres place at the
podium

MR SWANSON
Ladies and gentlemen I give you the
Icelandic Snow Owl

He pulls the cover off revealing TWO MAJESTIC FLUFFY WHITE
OWLS IN A CAGE Everyone OOHS and AHHS

LLOYD

important night for me

(MORE )

LLOYD (CONTD)
(beat)
Harry have you ever wondered why
you and I never have long-term
girlfriends

HARRY
What are you talking about I went
out with Fraida Felcher for two and
a half weeks

LLOYD
That was a fluke
(beat)
The reason we never have long-term
girlfriends is because of one thing
Were afraid of the C word

HARRY
Thats crazy We live for the C word

LLOYD
Im talking bout commitment

HARRY
(beat)
Oh

LLOYD

Well Im ready for commitment Harry
The first time I laid eyes on Mary
Swanson I knew she was the one

(beat)
Some things you feel in your heart

This girl makes me feel it all in
the heart

Suddenly Lloyd notices something across the room

HIS POV - A BEGUILING MARY SWANSON IS TALKING WITH A COUPLE
OF GUESTS SHES WEARING A

spectacular black cocktail dress
Lloyd quickly turns toward the bar

LLOYD (CONTD)

Harry thinks about this a moment

HARRY

LLOYD

Harry straightens his polka-dot bow-tie then APPROACHES
Mary who is now standing alone admiring the owls
HARRY (CONTD)

Mary turns to Harry stunned

MARY

HARRY

HARRY

Bulldog and a Shitzu

MARY

HARRY
Yeah We called it a Bullshit
(breaks out LAUGHING)
Just a little breeder joke

She seems strangely charmed by this
HARRY (CONTD)
Anyway the real reason I came over
is because I want to introduce you

Just then Marys stepmother approaches Shes holding a
martini and looking a little sloshed

HELEN

Mary shoots Helen a look then smiles at Harry

open it

LLOYD (CONTD)
Youre gonna be my best man Har I

Suddenly the CORK SHOOTS OUT OF THE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE AND
ZIPS ACROSS

THE ROOM LIKE A BULLET DIRECTLY TOWARD ONE OF THE NOW EVEN
WIDER-

EYED OWLS In quick succession we hear a BOK a SQUAWK
and a THUMP

stunned attention to the cage

THEIR POV - FEATHERS ARE FLOATING IN THE AIR THROUGHOUT THE
CAGE AND ONE OF THE ICELANDIC SNOW

Owls LIES ON ITS BACK its species now one bird closer to
extinction

Harry and Lloyd look on in horror Harry takes the smoking
champagne bottle from Lloyd and places it on the bar

HARRY
(under breath)
I think weve done enough hobnobbing
Lloyd

The guys LOWER THEIR HEADS and slink out of the room before
anyone can figure out what happened anyone except for
Nicholas Andre that is we PAN to show that hes been
standing nearby watching their every move And he doesnt
look very happy

Until he turned into a backstabber

LLOYD

me irresistable

Mary ROLLS HER EYES at this

LLOYD

Suddenly they hear the metallic CLICK-CLACK OF A GUN BEING

COCKED

ANDRE

Okay which one of you losers wants

The guys exchange a look and SWALLOW HARD

HARRY

I wouldnt pull that trigger if I

were you

ANDRE

Aspen love triangle You caught the
two of them in bed handcuffed them

to the post murdered them and killed

yourself

HARRY
(smug)

Except youre forgetting one minor

etail

ANDRE
Whats that

Lloyd and Mary look at Harry hopeful
HARRY
If you kill us youd be killing

yourself
ANDRE
(puzzled)
Huh

HARRY

You see philosophers believe that
were all really just tiny pieces of
one huge universal being In other
words I am you and you are me so

if you were to kill us youd be
committing suicide you unenlightened

ANDRE
--Shut up

Mary sees that theyre in deep shit now

MARY

ANDRE

Who wants to die first

Harry gestures with his head at Mary

HARRY
Kill her The bitch shouldve told
him she was married back at the
airport It wouldve saved us a lot
of trouble

Andre points the gun at Mary
LLOYD
No Ill go first Harry I was the
one who got you into this mess

Andre points the gun at Lloyd

HARRY
No wait do me first Im the one
who stole your girl Lloyd I eserve

Andre SIGHS and points the gun at Harry Then as Mary and
Lloyd look on in horror he FIRES TWICE Harry grabs his
stomach and falls off the bed to the floor

LLOYD
Jesus Christ You killed my best
friend you bastard

Andre smiles

ANDRE
If its any consolation youre about
to be reunited

He aims the gun at Lloyd COCKS THE TRIGGER Suddenly a
SHOT RINGS OUT and the gun is blown out of Andres hand

ON THE FLOOR - Harry is very much alive and pointing a pistol
at the stunned Nicholas Andre

LLOYD
Harry Youre alive

Just them the door BURSTS OPEN and SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS
storm in with their weapons drawn

COP 1
Get your hands up asshole

Lloyd and Harry throw their hands into the air A stunned
Andre turns to see six guns pointing at his head He
reluctantly raises his hands Mary and Lloyd are flabbergasted
by the turn of events

Theres a sudden commotion in the room Pushing her way
through the mass of cops comes the Athletic Beauty She
flashes an ID

ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Special Officer Kathryn Frick Federal
Bureau of Investigation

LLOYD
(dumbst ruck)
You gotta be kidding

ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Good work Harry

Lloyd looks to his friend confused Harry opens his shirt
revealing a BULLET-PROOF VEST

HARRY
She grabbed me down in the lobby and
explained what was up They slapped
this on me and gave me a gun
LLOYD
(to Athletic Beauty)
But how did you
ATHLETIC BEAUTY

way from Providence Mr and Mrs
Swanson had a homing device plated
in the briefcase
The guys glance guiltily at one another
HARRY

ATHLETIC BEAUTY
Every bill was counterfeit and marked
Harry and Lloyd EXHALE A SIGH OF RELIEF
CUT TO

EXT HOTEL DANBURY - NIGHT

hustled into a police car and driven away While Mary TALKS
to the police Harry and Lloyd stare at her lovingly

LLOYD

Shes something aint she Har
HARRY

You were right Lloyd She was
efinitely worth the trip

LLOYD
Guess we have to admit it she was
too good for us

Just then a cruiser pulls up and Marys husband jumps out

MELVIN

Harry and Lloyd stare in wonder as MEL GIBSON climbs out of
the car Mary and Mel embrace then Mel turns to the guys

MELVIN (CONTD)
I cant thank you enough fellas It
was so darn dank in that well I
really thought it would be the death
of me

Harry and Lloyd are too stunned to respond They look at
each other and we

DISSOLVE TO
INT LOBBY - HOTEL DANBURY - THE NEXT DAY

Lloyd and Harry come out of the elevator with their meager
luggage but this time nobody rushes to their aid

EXT HOTEL DANBURY - DAY

The guys EXIT the hotel and approach the Bell Captain
Barnard

HARRY

BELL CAPTAIN

LLOYD

appreciate all you did for us during

HARRY
And were um sorry about the money

BELL CAPTAIN

Swanson family has promised to
reimburse everyone

This seems to please Lloyd and Harry The hearse is delivered
to the front door

LLOYD
Well anyway thanks again for

They turn to go but Barnard CALLS TO THEM

BARNARD

HARRY
I dunno Im sure well find a trailer
camp somewhere to call home

BARNARD

Harry and Lloyd look at each other confused
LLOYD

This joint is a little out of our
budget Barney

BARNARD
(smiling)
Oh I think we might be able to find
you a free room somewhere -- after

all like you once told me were
all from the same mold

(winks)
You just dont have any dough right
now

The guys are STUNNED by Barnards generous offer

HARRY
Are you on the level

BARNARD
Absolutely Well just slide you
into one of the employee rooms

The guys beam at this
BARNARD (CONTD)
Provided of course you dont
mind working one or two afternoons a
week

Harry and Lloyd lock eyes Then

LLOYD
You know what Barney I think well
take out chances down the road

Barnard shakes his head as the two fools climb into their
hearse and drive off

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

As the hearse drives down the road we hear VO

HARRY
(vo)
Since were finished elbow-rubbing
what next lloyd

LLOYD
(vo)
I say we head due south and try a
little nose-rubbing with some of
them slinky eskimo babes

HARRY

As they head toward their next adventure the CAMERA PULLS
UP UP UP

END CREDITS
