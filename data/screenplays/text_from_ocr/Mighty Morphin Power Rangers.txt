Six thousand years ago a
morphological being known as Ivan
Ooze ruled the world with a
reign of unparalleled terror
Finally a rebel factor known as
the Order of the Meledon lured
him into a hyperlock chamber and
buried him deep underground
ALPHA 5
In a place that came to be known
as Angel Grove

ZORDON
The chamber has been accidently
UNCOVERED You must return it to
the depths or anyone should
open it and Ivan is released

your helmets with new Opti-Scan
devices

ZORDON
Use extreme caution Rangers
You are dealing with an evil here
that is beyond ALL comprehension

Barricades and police tape surround the egg A SECURITY GUARD
passes his sleeping CO-WORKER drops into a chair sips his
coffee

BZZWAPP -- ZEDD RITA GOLDAR and a short fat furry creature
named MORDANT appear

RITA
Another Saturday night and Im
traipsing around the galaxy with
the THREE LITTLE PIGS My mother

Rita she said after 89
marriages you might wanna think
about throwing in the towel Why

Zedd grumbles to himself

ZEDD

The stunned guard stirs his sleeping buddy
FIRST SECURITY GUARD

ZEDD
No need to wake him In fact

yourself

Zedd ZAPS THE GUYS with a bolt from his staff -- they are
knocked out

Goldar steps back from the blast and accidentally steps or
Mordants foot Mordant KNOCKS on Goldars metallic leg

MORDANT

Mordant GRUMBLES under his breath Meanwhile Zedd aims is
staff at the chamber and BURSTS a blast of energy The egg
opens up with a wHOOSH of decompressing air webs of
ELECTRICITY BRANCH OUT followed by a SWIRL OF BLACK SMOKE

When the smoke clears we see a BUBBLING PURPLE PHOSPHOSCENT
OOZE The group gathers around -- Rita sticks a finger in o
the sticky substance

RITA
What you spent two thousand
years looking for this tub of

SNOT

are too busy arguing to notice this

ZEDD

We hear a SLITHERING SLURPING SOUND as the substance RISES UP
AND TAKES ON THE GHASTLY SHAPE OF IVAN OOZE Mordant tugs at Zedd

MORDANT

apart revealing jagged teeth one of which is made of

GLISTENING SILVER

Ivans face goes dark THUNDER RUMBLES and the site LIGHTS UP
WITH A FLASH OF LIGHTNING Mordant turns to Goldar

MORDANT
Seems to ring a bell

ZEDD

Center without a power coin

Theres a BLEET BLEET -- emergency lights start FLASHING near
the entrance Alpha watches forlorn as OOZE SEEPS through
the hairline cracks in the door

ALPHA 5
Well ALMOST nobody

The ooze SLITHERS AND GURGLES ACROSS THE FLOOR once again
IVAN RISES UP He takes in the state-of-the-art surroundings

IVAN
Gee pretty fancy-shmancy I

well over SIXTY centuries you can
buy something pretty nice

Alpha drops into a Karate stance makes some BRUCE LEE NOISES
then LUNGES

ALPHA 5

Ivan holds his arm out ZAPS Alpha with an electrical charge
Alpha starts spinning

ALPHA 5
Welcome to Wiener World May I
take your order please

ZORDON

Youre still picking on creatures
smaller than yourself

Ivan slowly circles Zordans column of light Zordon turns
with him

IVAN
Put a cork in it Z Ten
minutes out of the egg and Im
already listening to one of your
lectures

(he explodes furiously)

You robbed me of my PRIME I was
the Supreme Ruler of the most
foul Empire in the Universe I
was the King of Calamity The
Duke of Destruction The big man
on campus

(beat)
And then you came along You
locked me into your stuffy little
hyperlock-chamber and tossed me
into the depths like yesterdays
TRASH

ZORDON
It worked for six thousand years

IVAN
Dont remind me

IVAN
Do you have any idea what its
like to be cooped up in a rotten
egg for six thousand years Its
BORING Not to mention Ive had
a Charlie horse since the
Renaissance But now the tables
are turned Now

IVAN raises his hands - he is holding a flute and he PLAYS A FEW
NOTES

IVAN
its time to pay the PIPER
He uses the flute like a lightning rod -- A BOLT OF LIGHTNING
BLASTS A PANEL TO SMITHEREENS

IVAN
Oh the things that I have
missed The BLACK PLAGUE

He blows up another PANEL

IVAN

The SPANISH INQUISITION

(another bolt)

The 70s

HE BLOWS UP ANOTHER PANEL Ivan CASTS ANOTHER LIGHTNING BOLT
DEMOLISHING AN ENERGY PILLAR

IVAN
And now finally I have the
strength to DESTROY your pathetic
powers FOREVER

ZORDON
YOU WONT GET AWAY WITH THIS

IVAN
Ive got a NEWS flash for you
LIGHT-BRIGHT -- I ALREADY HAVE

Now Ivan begins to THROW LIGHTNING EVERYWHERE LAYING
THE COMMAND CENTER TO WASTE

Ivan laughs in the bg as Alpha continues to spin
moving his arms in and out

ALPHA 5

put your left probe out you put
your left probe in and you shake
it all about You do the hokey-
pokey and you turn yourself
around

It is said that to those who
possess the Power all things
are possible

BILLY
Where did it originate

DULCEA
In another time another
dimension It was brought here
long ago by the Nathadians a
people who are now all but
extinct
They built an impenetrable stone
Monolith to store the power and
keep it from their enemies
(ominous)
For thousands of years beings
from all over the Universe have
tried to obtain it ALL have
perished

hang heavily in the air

AISHA
So how can we get to it

DULCEA
The only way to obtain the power
is to achieve the highest state
of being

TOMMY
And how do we do that

DULCEA
By learning the ancient art of
Ninjetti It is the Genesis of
what you on earth have come to
know as the Ninja

(beat)
It is the perfect union of mind
body and spirit

ROCKY
Look Zordon doesnt have much
longer to live And for all we
know Angel Grove could already
be under attack We dont have
TIME for this

over Kimberlys shoulder She hasnt noticed it yet

DULCEA
You dont understand If you do
not have the Ninjetti the power
will destroy you

traverse the Neola jungle We
will train today and set out on
foot tomorrow

with its piercing eyes

We hear a GRUNTING SOUND as the SILHOUETTE OF AN APE APPEARS

Now a FROG HOPS through the air and lands inches away from
Adam The frog sits there a moment its THROAT THROBBING

Now we hear a DEEP GROWL and a tree SHAKES Aisha fidgets in
her sleep as an ENORMOUS BEAR SHADOW FALLS OVER HER

Now all at once the six animals VANISH INTO THIN AIR LIKE

Goldar suddenly point to the sky

GOLDAR
Hey boss

THE TENGU DROPS INTO THE SCENE SQUEALING
MORDANT
What kind of landing was that
These clowns are a menace to the
sky

IVAN
How did you fare

Mordant waves Ivan off

MORDANT
Oh it couldntve gone better
The Power Rangers didnt know
what hit them

The Tengu appear one of them SQUAWKS and makes grand gestures

MORDANT
Thats right And then we threw
one of them off a mountain and
another one into a raqing river

IVAN
So theyve been destroyed

The Tengu SQUAWKS some more

MORDANT
Basically

IVAN
What do you mean basically

MORDANT
Well we were about to finish
them off when this huge
monster came out of nowhere

MORDANT
Okay maybe he wasnt so huge
But you shouldve seen the size
of his STICKS

A pensive look comes over Ivan

IVAN
Did these sticks make a whistling
sound

MORDANT

Howd you know
IVAN
Dulcea

(beat)
That miserable manipulating
loathsome she-devil of a WITCH

To help make the point Mordant SPITS on the ground

IVAN
How could you let them get away
If Dulcea leads them to the Great
Power everything will be ruined
They must be OBLITERATED

One of the Tengu SCREECHES again

MORDANT
Whatre you talking about It
wasnt my fault Youre the
featherbrains that let them get
away

Ivan looks up to the sky

IVAN
I call upon the Powers of
Darkness to enrich the evil of my
creatures by tenfold

LIGHTNING RIPS from the sky and ZAPS THE TENGU CAUSING THEM TO
GLOW RADIANTLY

IVAN
And now the coup de grace to
lead my tribe to victorious
battle

He shoots a BOLT OF ENERGY AND CREATES THE OUEEN TENGU She is
a different color than the rest and her eyes GLOW RED Mordant
shakes his head in wonder

MORDANT
Where does he come up with this
stuff

The Queen spreads her wings and makes the most HORRENDOUS
SCREECH imaginable

FLIP and lands it however one foot slips off and she struggles
to maintain her balance

like a falcon SOARS THROUGH THE AIR He gets about ten feet
then DROPS INTO THE WATER

up about FIFTEEN FEET before he slips He only drops five
feet

6 Adam stands amidst overhanging trees and goes into his frog
animal stance his entire being focused on his actions

7 Billy stands off alone practicing with the whistling
sticks The weapons are now a BLURR in his hands

8 Kimberly balances along the log executes a FLIP lands it

know each other

Dulcea reminisces

DULCEA
We belonged to an interstellar
Peace Keeping Force known as the
Order of the Meledan

(beat)
Zordon was widely regarded as the
finest Commander in the Galaxy
He was a true Legend If it
wasnt for him the Universe
would be a very different place
from what it is today

The kids are overwhelmed by what theyre hearing

ROCKY
So what happened

DULCEA
Over time our enemies were
defeated I returned to
Phaedos Zordon moved on to
continue the struggle elsewhere
Until you kids

(beat)
showed up I

hadnt heard from him for

centuries

The Rangers are silent for a moment

DULCEA

He was always an inspiration

Dulcea speaks with grim-visaged intensity

DULCEA

This is why Im taking you to the
Nathadian Monolith That is why
Im teaching you the Ninjetti

If Zordon dies
all of us dies

of good within

the Universe will

be dealt an irreparable blow

These words strike deep in the kids

only ten triacs to release it

TOMMY

And how do we release the power

Remember ten triacs After that

SCREECHES and STOMPS down his taloned foot missing the
creature by inches

We hear a CAW and the Queen Tengu squints as she spots a falcon
circling in the sky above The Queen is perched on top of a 20
foot rock face She looks around hesitantly

Now the Rangers ATTACK some of them LUNGING OFF ROCKS others
BURSTING out of crevices others coming over the walls

Billy wields his WHISTLING sticks -- misses several times then
starts BASHING and THWACKING the feathered beasts

The Queen SHOOTS A LASER BLAST from her eyes -- it EXPLODES

EXCHANGES BLOWS with her foe

She finally drops into a crane stance then just like Dulcea
