ZISSOU
No I dropped the camera

The audience laughs The director of the festival translates
Zissou’s answer into Italian and the audience laughs again

squints at Ned He says evenly

ZISSOU
Well that was only Part 1 It’s a cliff-
hanger Now I’m going to hunt down that
shark or whatever it is and hopefully
kill it I’m not sure how maybe
dynamite

A murmur goes through the audience Some of them have already
begun to gather their things and make their way to the exits
The director of the festival looks confused

FESTIVAL DIRECTOR
You don’t know what it is

ZISSOU
No I’ve never seen anything like it in
my life

FESTIVAL DIRECTOR
You said it was a jaguar shark That’s
the title of the film

ZISSOU

first two words that came into my head

The director of the festival hesitates Zissou points to a
young woman in the audience with her hand in the air She

asks a question in French The director of the festival
translates for Zissou

Hennessey laughs He kisses Eleanor again and rejoins his
Japanese television crew Eleanor takes Zissou by the arm and
walks with him

ELEANOR
Well I was in love with him at the
time

ZISSOU
(sighs)
Yeah I know He’s charismatic

ELEANOR
How are you feeling

ZISSOU
(strangely)
I’m right on the edge I don’t know what

Eleanor looks into Zissou’s eyes She frowns She opens her
handbag and digs inside She says to Zissou

ELEANOR
Wait here I’1l be right back

Eleanor walks away A tall beautiful African girl comes over
and stops squarely in front of Zissou Zissou looks nervous

AFRICAN GIRL
I just wanted to say hello Hi

ZISSOU
(relieved)
Hey baby

Zissou starts to kiss the African girl on the cheek She
blocks him with her arm and feints away Zissou looks
surprised

AFRICAN GIRL
I said I wanted to say hello I didn’t
say I wanted you to touch me

Valiums for Zissou She and the African girl stare at each
other Zissou points to Eleanor

safari jacket spying on him from behind a lamp The elderly
man moves away Zissou swallows the pills and drinks the
whiskey He goes over to a television set on a pedestal

It shows him being interviewed on an English talk show
Esteban sits beside him The host says

HOST (ON TV)
People say Eleanor is the brains behind
Team Zissou What is Steve

Zissou hesitates Esteban interrupts slyly

ESTEBAN (ON TV)
He’s the Zissou

Esteban shrugs

Zissou smiles identically on television and watching it He
reaches out and touches Esteban’s face on the screen Static
crackles at his fingertip He turns away from the television
set and looks across the room blankly Klaus brings over a
ten-year-old German boy with bronzecolored skin and nearly-
white hair in a buzz-cut He wears lederhosen He carries a
small plastic bag filled with water

KLAUS
Steve this is my little nephew Werner
He wanted to meet you
Zissou pats the boy on the head

ZISSOU
How you doing Werner

Werner holds out the plastic bag

There is a tiny blue green yellow red and orange striped
sea-horse swimming inside Zissou says quietly

ZISSOU
A crayon pony-fish

Zissou looks down at Werner

ZISSOU
Thanks pal

Zissou takes off his tie and puts it into his pocket He tugs
on his collar and takes a deep breath Klaus frowns

KLAUS
You don’t look too good Steve

Zissou licks his hand and presses down his hair awkwardly
rearranging his cowlicks He looks to Klaus

ZISSOU
How about now

Klaus hesitates Zissou sees the elderly man in the safari
jacket lurking behind him He snaps

ZISSOU
What do you need old man

The elderly man thrusts a photograph and a pen into Zissou’s
hands

ELDERLY MAN
Could you sign this please

Zissou looks at the photograph It is a picture of a younger
blond Zissou underwater pointing a spear-gun at a black squid
with four blue eyes and yellow ink A title across the bottom
says Shadow Creatures of the Lurisia Archipelago

Zissou signs the photograph

ELDERLY MAN

picture of two divers with movie cameras filming a swarm of
writhing sea-cobras A title across the bottom says The
Battling Eels of Antibes

Zissou signs the photograph

ELDERLY MAN
And this

The elderly man hands Zissou another photograph It is a
picture of a younger Zissou running at a full sprint
alongside a black panther with white spots A title across
the bottom says Island Cats

Zissou frowns

ZISSOU
How many you got there

Zissou sees that there are about twenty-five more photographs
in the elderly man’s hand He frowns

ZISSOU
Just forge the rest of them will you

ELDERLY MAN
(hesitates)
But I could’ve done that --

ZISSOU
Get lost Get out of here

The elderly man looks startled He walks away

Zissou sees Eleanor standing alone outside the window looking
into the harbor He raps on the glass Eleanor turns to look
at him Zissou shrugs He waves to her Eleanor waves back

sadly She holds up a pill of her own and swallows it with a
drink of whiskey

Zissou smiles

red carpet along the front steps surrounded by a mob of fans
and paparazzi snapping pictures jostling and yelling
Drakoulias Klaus Ogata Pelé Renzo and Vikram follow
them Zissou is blank and silent He puts on his red cap

A tall man in a polo shirt motions to Zissou

TALL MAN

shiva for your friend Esteban

Zissou stops He looks at the man

Z2ISSOU
What’d you say

Pause The man shrugs and says with a slight smile

TALL MAN
Who you going to kill in Part 2

The man points a pocket camera at Zissou and takes a
snapshot Zissou stares at the man He lunges through the
crowd and reaches for the man’s throat The man dodges
awkwardly and clips Zissou across the mouth with his camera
Klaus and Drakoulias pull Zissou back The mob goes into a
panic Eleanor lights a cigarette

Zissou moves away disoriented holding his hand against his
mouth A line of blood runs down the side of his chin He
looks at his sea-horse The plastic bag is leaking

Zissou takes a glass of champagne out of someone’s hand He
empties it onto the ground He pours the sea-horse and the
rest of the water into the glass He walks down the steps in
a daze holding the glass carefully above the crowd

Eleanor looks to Zissou Zissou stares down at her cards

Pause Eleanor moves the three of clubs onto the four of
hearts

KLAUS
Werner what are you doing

Werner stands on a table in the corner of the room with his
sleeve rolled up to his shoulder and his arm reaching for a
turtle at the bottom of an aquarium filled with water

Be careful Werner That’s a snapper

Werner lifts the turtle out of the aquarium It has red and
yellow markings and a slightly broken shell He flips it
over The word Albert is written on the bottom of the turtle
in magic marker He drops it back into the tank

breath He nods Ned looks at him with a hopeful expression
Zissou suddenly finds himself struggling to hold back his
emotions He looks up at the sky He shakes his head

ZISSOU
Ill be right back Don’t go away

Zissou turns and walks quickly among the party-goers They
try to get his attention but he does not respond He climbs

filled with people including Drakoulias talking loudly and
rinking Eleanor sits with her legs crossed holding a
champagne cocktail and smoking a cigarette

Zissou stands above her with Ned just behind them

ZISSOU
Obviously this all comes unexpectedly
You never knew about it But --

ELEANOR
I’d heard the story -- and you told me it
wasn’t true

ZISSOU
Well it probably isn’t We’re talking
ancient history here But anyway his
mother just died plus we’re having some
problems --

Eleanor gives Zissou a cold look Ned jams his hands into his
pockets and shifts uncomfortably

ZISSOU
-- and I just think it’s a very special
opportunity for all of us Especially
him He needs this deal

ELEANOR
(quickly)
OK Bring him over

ZISSOU
(hesitates)
Well he’s right here

Zissou points to Ned Eleanor turns around and sees him Ned
bows awkwardly Eleanor looks flustered She says simply

ELEANOR
I’m sorry How do you do

INT BRIDGE NIGHT

Zissou and Ned sit in the dark at the controls of the ship
Lights blink on the consoles Zissou smokes a joint

ZISSOU
No it went OK There’s just a lot in
play here that’s got nothing to do with

Zissou hands the joint to Ned Ned hesitates then takes a
puff He exhales

Zissou nods and smokes
NED
I have to tell you I’ve been a member of
the Zissou Society since I was eleven

A life-sized cross-section of the entire ship anchored in

shallow waters The hull is rusted along the water-line and
needs a coat of paint It is day and the sky is pink Zissou

stands on deck with a fishing pole in his hands People move
among the cabins inside There are schools of fish coral
and seaweed below The camera takes us from one area to the
next as Zissou describes the facilities in voice-over

ZISSOU (VO)
The Belafonte was a long-range sub-hunter
during the second world war which we
bought from the US Navy for 900000
This is my mentor Lord Mandrake He’s
dead now

A silver-nitrate photograph of a dashing old man hangs on the
wall of the dining room In the picture the man stands on a
beach dressed all in white with his trouser legs rolled-up

The camera booms down two levels to a completely blue-tiled
Spa on the lowest deck Steam fills the air A sturdy Nordic
woman in her sixties gives Klaus a violent massage

ZISSOU (VO)
The sauna was designed by an engineer
from the Chinese space program and we
keep a Swedish masseuse on staff

We move quickly past a laboratory with a large colorful
periodic table hanging from the wall Wolodarsky sits on a
stool noodling on a Casio keyboard and a cheap drum machine
A beaker of orange liquid bubbles on a Bunsen burner Zissou
says dismissively

ZISSOU (VO)
Here’s where we do all our different
science projects and experiments and so on

We arrive at the kitchen There is a fancy new dishwasher a
computerized refrigerator and a digital toaster-oven The
wine cellar is twice the size of the laboratory A cook ices
Happy Birthday Ogata across the top of a cake

ZISSOU (V0O)
This is the kitchen which contains
probably some of the most technologically
advanced equipment on the ship

The next cabin is lined with books from floor to ceiling on
every wall with a Dewey decimal system card-catalogue There
is a metal rack displaying a twenty-five volume collection of
Zissou Society books on various esoteric undersea creatures
and phenomena Tragedy of the Red Octopus The Sexual
Maturity of the Moonfish The Arctic Night-lights They are
all written by Eleanor Zissou and she sits behind the rack
correcting a set of proofs and smoking a brown cigarette

ZISSOU (V0O)
Eleanor put together a top-notch research
library for us with a complete first-
edition set of the Life Aquatic companion
series

We go to a sound-proofed room the size of a closet Vikram
sits inside behind a glass partition He wears headphones
Renzo operates a tape recorder There is also a flat-bed
editing console and an accumulation of out-dated film
developing machines

ZISSOU (VO)
We process our own rushes and keep a
cutting room on-board so we can do an
assembly while were shooting

There are three little beeps before Vikram speaks into a
microphone in a panicked voice

VIKRAM
I can’t find them

Renzo murmurs some mild approval and presses a button We
move to a metal sphere with portholes all over it connected
to the bottom of the ship Ogata is inside He looks out with
his face pressed against the glass

ZISSOU (V0O)
This is the observation bubble which I
thought up in a dream actually

There are two white dolphins with cameras and electronic gear
attached to them swimming underwater alongside the vessel
They have pink eyes

ZISSOU (VO)
Two albino scouts swim with the ship
They’re supposedly very intelligent
although I’ve never seen any evidence of
it

We move past the screw and rudder back up into the ship The
motor looks old and jerry-rigged with a severely rusted and
warped section of rods and valves which leak into a pan

ZISSOU (V0O)
Here’s the engine room The bearing-
casings aren’t supposed to look like
that but we can’t afford to fix them
this year

The main deck is outfitted with an array of weather-beaten
equipment two cranes and a helicopter landing deck Pelé
sits in a chair tuning his guitar

ZISSOU (VO)
Topside we’ve got the bridge the mini-
sub an old chopper and all kinds of
radar and sonar and underwater movie
gadgets

A submersible vessel on deck was once called Jacqueline but
that word has been crossed-out and Deep Search has been
printed below it

NED (VO)
What happened to Jacqueline

ZISSOU (VO)
(bittersweet)
She didn’t really love me

All the lights in the ship dim suddenly and the light of the
pink sky and the blue water gently fades to black

EXT EXPLORERS CLUB DAY

The next morning A converted palazzo behind a church A
brass plaque next to the door says Explorers Club

INT EXPLORERS CLUB DAY

The great hall There are paintings of adventurers on the
walls big-game hunters arctic explorers archaeologists
astronauts aviators etc Under a stuffed and mounted
swordfish there are portraits of three oceanographers

One is of Mandrake based on the photograph One is of
Zissou underwater in a swimsuit One is of Hennessey
Gressed in a tailored white lab coat tweed pants sandals

and a pink cashmere scarf He wears a supercilious half-
smile

Zissou and Ned are still in their clothes from the night
before They look very dishevelled Zissou points to the
picture of Hennessey

ZISSOU
This guy’s a big-time asshole We were
room-mates at the Academy and he used to
be married to Eleanor

ZISSOU (cont d)

(pause)
He hogs up all the grant money

The dining room which is empty except for a few leathery
battle-hardened old men and a group of young academics A

waiter stands beside Zissou and Ned at their table

ZISSOU
You think you’ll want to change your
name

NED
(hesitates)
Ned

ZISSOU
No not the Ned part unless you want to
I mean your last name I thought you
might let me give you mine

NED
(pause)
Ned Zissou

ZISSOU
Ned Zissou exactly Or if you want you
can change the first part too I
would’ve named you Kingsley if Id had a
say in it

NED
Kingsley I don’t know Maybe I’11 stick
with Ned for now

ZISSOU
Sure That’s OK Anyway I’11l order you
some correspondence stock

The waiter opens a bottle of red wine and pours a little bit
into Ned’s glass for him to taste Zissou looks horrified He

says to the waiter

ZISSOU
What are you doing

The waiter hesitates Ned looks uneasy

ZISSOU
He doesn’t know anything about wine I
ordered the wine Pour it here

The waiter pours some wine for Zissou Zissou leans forward
and sniffs it He nods The waiter fills their glasses

NED
You know I wasn’t sure you’d even want
to meet me

ZISSOU
Yeah Well we still need to find out if
were really compatible as father and
son I guess
(annoyed)
Are those assholes talking about me

One of the young academics at the next table says loudly in
Italian (subtitled in English)

YOUNG ACADEMIC
No I thought that was Steve Zissou Have
you seen him lately He’s gotten creepy
He wears a gay little earring and he
drunkenly tried to hit on my fifteen-year-
old cousin at a French disco She was
terrified What happened to him His last
movies are just total --

One of the young academic’s companions whispers something to
him The young academic frowns

YOUNG ACADEMIC
What No

The young academic turns around quickly and looks Zissou
square in the eye Zissou stares at him coldly The young
academic looks mortified He turns away and sinks into his
chair

Silence Zissou suddenly bursts out laughing hysterically
EXT STREET DAY

A narrow cobble-stoned alley at the edge of a square Zissou
sits on a curb in the shadows curled over with his head
buried in his lap and his arms wrapped around his knees Ned
squats beside him

ZISSOU
People tell me when someone says
something like that about you it’s
because they’re jealous -- but it still
hurts
(with a catch in his voice)
It hurts bad

NED
That man was damn rude He can go to
hell

Zissou stands up He takes the earring out of his ear and
throws it into the street Ned picks it up and hands it back
to Zissou Zissou puts it into his pocket (He will never
wear it again)

ZISSOU
How’d she die by the way Your mother

NED
(pause)
She took her own life She took sleeping
pills

ZISSOU
(wounded)
Why would she do that

NED
Well she was in a great deal of pain
you know

ZISSOU
(quietly)
Oh I see Yeah
(pause)
You know my best friend just got killed
Esteban

NED
I know he did I’m sorry

Zissou nods Pause

ZISSOU
Let’s go to my island

NED
(hesitates)
Well but I’m supposed to be back in
Kentucky on Thursday

ZISSOU
Thursday OK That’s OK

Zissou looks up and down the street He turns to Ned
ZISSOU

Where can we charter a water-plane around
here

EXT OCEAN DAY

A small single-engine sea-plane flies low over the water and
banks around a group of tiny volcanic islands

EXT MARINA DAY

Zissou and Ned climb out of the sea-plane onto the dock at
Pescespada Island Zissou carries an open bottle of black
rum and each holds a shot glass They walk toward the
compound

EXT ZISSOU HOUSE DAY

The main living quarters is a white and pale blue terra-cotta
house with peeling paint and numerous French doors all wide
open White curtains ripple in the breeze and dozens of
domesticated birds fly in and out of the rooms Five Siamese
cats prowl around the front porch There are olive trees and
grape vines and two Irish wolfhounds in the garden There is
a small wooden tower ten feet tall with a ladder up the side
and a telescope on the top

Eleanor stands at the end of the path She wears white pants
and a white tunic with a string of turquoise beads around her
neck She holds a white tulip bulb and a trowel There are
grass stains and dirt on her clothes She watches as Zissou
and Ned shuffle over to her

Zissou drinks the last of the rum and hands Ned the empty
bottle

ELEANOR
Your cat’s dead

ZISSOU
(stunned)
What Which one

ELEANOR
Marmalade I’m sorry

ZISSOU
(pained)
What happened

ELEANOR
A rattlesnake bit it in the throat

ZISSOU
(hesitates)
Goddammit Eleanor Why do you have to

ZISSOU (contd)

say it like that Couldn’t you break it
to me a little --

Eleanor turns away and walks into the garden Zissou and Ned
stand together in silence Zissou finally sighs and says

ZISSOU
She’s a rich bitch you know She was
raised by maids Her parents paid for
this island and two of my worst movies
(pause)
People say she’s the brains behind Team
Zissou

NED
People say a lot of things What kind of
cat was it

ZISSOU
(upset)
Who gives a shit

Pause Zissou says sadly

ZISSOU
I think she was a tabby

Ned nods Eleanor finishes planting her tulip and walks past
Zissou and Ned toward the house

ELEANOR
Come inside Ned Let’s make-up a room
for you

Ned looks to Zissou and follows Eleanor into the house
Eleanor says without looking back

ELEANOR
That reporter called

Zissou nods He goes over to a bucket of ice near the front

door and takes out a fish He walks through the garden to a

large swimming pool adjacent to the laboratory buildings He
stands on the edge of a platform and holds the fish out over
the water He waits expressionlessly

A killer whale bursts into the air takes the fish out of
Zissou’s hand and splashes back into the water

INT ZISSOU HOUSE NIGHT
A guest bedroom Ned is asleep with the windows open A

digital flip-clock reads 2AM Zissou’s voice shouts from an
intercom next to the bed

ZISSOU (VO)
Ned wake up

Ned opens his eyes and looks around the room in confusion

ZISSOU (VO)
I’m on the echo-box Push the red button
to answer Throw on your slop and meet me
on the beach in twelve minutes

Ned finds the intercom He holds down a red button and says

NED
OK

EXT BEACH NIGHT

There is a mist along the shore Ned has a tape recorder
slung around his neck He wears headphones and holds a
microphone Klaus carries a 16mm camera with a spotlight
attached to it on his shoulder Zissou and Ogata stand in
front of them They have large flashlights which are turned
off They all wear pale blue and green striped pajamas
Zissou speaks into Klaus’ camera

ZISSOU
Seven-apple take one
(dramatically)
Only twice before have I had the good
fortune to observe a rubber tide -- that

rare occurrence when hundreds of electric
jellyfish spontaneously wash onto a beach-
head at once Ogata brings exactly this

to our attention tonight

Zissou nods to Ogata They turn on their flashlights There
is a sea of man-of-wars awash on the shore They shimmer and
breathe in the soft glow Silence

NED
Steve what produces that effect of
illumination Is there a chemical inside
the organism

ZISSOU
(pause)
No Ned It’s actually the reflection of
our flashlights off their outer membranes
(impressed with Ned’s line)
That was a good ad-lib

Zissou stares at Ned He turns to Klaus suddenly

ZISSOU
Klaus move into a two-shot of me and
Ned

Zissou stands next to Ned Klaus points the camera at the two
of them Zissou puts his hand on Ned’s shoulder and says with
heightened significance

ZISSOU
Would you like to join my crew

Klaus looks horrified Ned hesitates

NED
What do you mean

ZISSOU
I want you on Team Zissou

Ned looks surprised and moved Klaus cuts the camera Ned
says reluctantly

NED
I don’t think I can do that

ZISSOU
(thrown)
Why not

NED
Well for one thing it’s not my field I
don’t have the background for it

ZISSOU
Nobody here does Klaus used to be a bus
driver Wolodarsky was a high-school
substitute teacher I found Esteban
slinging cassoulet in a cheap road-side

brasserie
(standing on his toes)
We’re all a pack of strays -- don’t you
get it
NED
I’m not even that strong of a swimmer
Steve

Zissou stares at Ned with a blank expression Ned says
suddenly

NED
The answer is yes

ZISSOU
Well it’s got to be I’11l order you a
red cap and a Speedo

Zissou hugs Ned Ned seems overwhelmed Zissou turns to
Klaus

ZISSOU
Cut

Zissou sees that Klaus is pointing the camera at the ground

ZISSOU
Klaus Why aren’t you rolling You’re
supposed to be getting this

KLAUS
Can I have a word with you please

Zissou frowns He goes over to Klaus and they speak
privately

ZISSOU
That was a goddamn tear-jerker Why’d you
cut it man

KLAUS
Because the sound’s going to be shit He
doesn’t know how to hold a boom He
doesn’t know diddly-jack about what we

do
ZISSOU
Don’t cut unless I say cut
NED
(excitedly)

I‘ve never seen so many electric
jellyfish in my life

Zissou and Kiaus look at Ned A voice behind them says

JANE
Those are Viet-Cong man-of-wars

They all turn around and see a pregnant thirty-year-old
woman with three suitcases standing about twenty-five feet
away in the mist near the water She wears rolled-up khaki
shorts a safari jacket and rubber boots Her hair is ina
braided pony-tail She chews gum She looks severely
exhausted
Zissou stares down at one of the man-o-wars He nudges it
with his foot

ZISSOU
Shit She’s right I guess we’ll have to
loop that line
(to Jane)
Where’d you come from You look pregnant

JANE
I am pregnant I’m not even going to ask
what you men are doing out here in your
matching pajamas by the way

ZISSOU
(annoyed)
We’re producing a film as matter of
fact Who are you

JANE
I‘m Jane Winslett-Richardson Im the
reporter from Oceanographic Explorer

ZISSOU
Oh yeah Sure How’d you get out here
JANE
I hired some drunk with a fishing boat
ZISSOU
(hesitates)

Well that takes four hours Whyd you --

JANE
Because no one picked me up at the f-ing
airport

ZISSOU
You’re kidding Jesus Christ Klaus I’m
sorry One of my guys was supposed to do
that

INT CORRIDOR NIGHT

Ned and Klaus carry Jane’s suitcases down a long hallway
Zissou and Jane walk with them empty-handed There are
action-photographs of crew members past and present on every

wall

Jane says to Ned

JANE

Zissou

NED
(hesitates)
Approximately only ten minutes actually
I was hired during the scene on the

beach
KLAUS
(skeptically)

JANE
(surprised)

ZISSOU
(warmly)

CUT TO

Zissou and Klaus standing outside of Jane’s room while Ned
lugs her bags through the door They see Jane’s reflection in
the bathroom mirror as she shakes some sand out of her shoe
She is cocked over with her shirt tugged up in the back She
blows a bubble

Zissou looks to Klaus Klaus raises an eyebrow Zissou shakes
his head

etc Zissou puts a can of exposed film into a refrigerator

Eleanor stands in the doorway dressed in her white bathrobe

ELEANOR
What are you going to do with him
ZISSOU
Who Ned What do you mean
(hesitates)
I don’t understand the question

Eleanor shrugs She turns away and starts to go

ZISSOU
I offered him a spot on the Belafonte

Eleanor stops and stands with her back to Zissou She says
darkly

ELEANOR
He didn’t take it did he

ZISSOU
(urgently)
Of course he took it We’re going to put
him on the map Eleanor We’re going to
throw him a life saver I believe in this

Pause Zissou shrugs He says simply

ZISSOU
Because he looks up to me

INT CORRIDOR NIGHT

Ned stands at the end of the hallway talking on a wall-
mounted telephone He holds an Air Kentucky travel bag of
toiletries

NED
Yes sir And McKinnon’s willing to take
over my shuttle flights That’s right

Ned listens for a minute He says quietly

NED
Well I just feel I need to see this
thing through sir
(pause)
Thank you for understanding I’11 check
in with the Louisville office again next
month

CUT TO

Ned walking barefoot down the corridor He goes past one of
the guest rooms The door is half-open He stops and listens

A Bach cassette plays on a tape recorder and Jane says ina
loud measured voice

JANE
Perhaps if her eyes had not been quite so
black -- which was what struck one most
forcibly on first seeing her -- I would

not have been as I was so especially
enamored of their imagined blue

Ned looks inside Jane is sitting-up in her bunk She wears
an army issue bathrobe and has a copy of a book by Marcel
Proust in her lap Her bags are unpacked and clothes
papers and junk-food wrappers are strewn all over the room

She sees Ned Ned freezes He ducks out into the hall Jane
frowns She says loudly

JANE
Hold it

Ned looks back into Jane’s room Pause

NED
Is that a poem

JANE
(hesitates)
No it’s a six-volume novel

Jane points to the other five volumes stacked on a chair next
to the bed

NED

Mercy Are you going to read the whole
thing to yourself out loud

JANE

I’m not reading it to myself I’m reading
it to him

Jane points at her stomach Ned nods
NED
That’s nice I bet it’1ll make him
smarter
Jane shrugs Pause She points at Ned
JANE

When did you learn Zissou was your
father

Ned looks uneasy Jane raises an eyebrow

JANE
Does it freak you out for me to ask that

NED
No but it’s a difficult question I sort
of pieced it together over the years

JANE
Well how did he first contact you

NED
He didn’t I came looking for him after
my mother died last month She had
ovarian cancer and then it spread to her
stomach and liver and then she took her
own life

JANE
(pause)
Oh

NED
Well good-night I guess

JANE
Good-night

Ned looks to the door He looks back to Jane Pause
NED
Do you mind if I stay and listen for a
little while
JANE
(long pause)
OK

Ned quickly takes the stack of books off the chair and sits
down Jane shrugs

JANE
You want me to catch you up on the story

NED
No Ill figure it out

Jane nods She turns the page and continues

EXT ZISSOU HOUSE DAY

The next morning Zissou sits outside in a yellow folding
lawn chair Klaus and Jane stand beside him The patio door
is open and Ned sweeps the kitchen floor in the background
He is dressed in his pilot’s uniform and a Team Zissou apron

Zissou slices open a large cardboard box with a diving knife

ZISSOU
They made them for three and a half years
before they terminated my sponsorship

Zissou holds the knife in his teeth while he pulls away some
bubble wrap and spills out a pile of Styrofoam packaging
peanuts The box is filled with white sneakers with
aquamarine laces and aquamarine navy and swimming-pool-
green stripes The labels on the sneakers read Adidas
Zissou

Zissou takes out a pair and checks the size He says quietly

ZISSOU
I’d say this lot comes from around 1987

Zissou slips on a pair stands up and starts jumping up and
down bouncing on the fresh treads He says wildly
enthusiastically

ZISSOU
Wow These are great

INT WRITING SHED DAY

A tiny hut the size of a closet Eleanor sits in a green
velvet armchair with a board covered in billiard-table felt
across her lap She is writing on a yellow legal pad
Drawings and photographs of different species of penguin are
pinned all over the walls around her along with dozens of
pictures of her observing and photographing them in the
arctic

Ned walks past the window carrying his mop and a bucket of
soapy water Eleanor hesitates

ELEANOR
Ned What are you doing

Ned stops and looks to Eleanor Pause

NED
Steve gave me a few assignments to finish
before lunch and I wanted to get right
on them -- first day and all

Eleanor frowns Ned sees a small live penguin chewing on a
sardine in a wicker cage next to Eleanor’s chair Ned looks
surprised He points at the penguin

NED
Can that gentleman survive here

ELEANOR
(distractedly)
Him Yeah

Ned shakes his head impressed He speaks quietly to the
penguin

NED
You must be perspiring under that tuxedo
my little companion

Eleanor stares at Ned’s pilot’s cap She has a distant look
in her eye

ELEANOR
Kentucky I once had a dirty weekend in
Kentucky
NED
(hesitates)

A dirty weekend What’s that

Eleanor looks at Ned curiously She starts to go on but
stops She says frankly

ELEANOR
A dirty weekend is when youre in a place
where youre not supposed to be with
someone you’re not supposed to be with
Can I say something to you as your
potential stepmother

NED
(caught off-guard)
I’d be delighted

ELEANOR
Be careful OK

Ned hesitates He looks at his mop and says vaguely

NED
I won’t walk on it ‘til after it’s dry

ELEANOR
I’m not talking about the floor

INT LABORATORY DAY

An underground room filled with out-dated computers and
recording equipment A large window looks into a deep
swimming pool with the killer whale in it Wolodarsky sits in
a corner mixing chemicals which rapidly change colors
Zissou and Jane sit across from each other at a metal desk
Zissou wears his Team Zissou shirt and matching aquamarine
pants with navy blue stripes down the sides Jane has a tape
recorder and a little notebook in front of her

Zissou is eating a banana

JANE
May I turn this on

ZISSOU
(chewing)
Fire one

Jane presses record on her tape recorder She says directly
with earnest concern

JANE
So what happened in your opinion

ZISSOU
(pause)
What are you talking about

JANE
Well don’t you think the public
perception of your work has --

ZISSOU
(frowns)
That’s your first question I thought
this was supposed to be a puff-piece

JANE
(hesitates)
Should we come back to it

ZISSOU
(sighs)
Yeah

JANE
OK Is it true this is going to be your
last voyage

ZISSOU
(stunned)
Wow No comment Who told you that No

warm up with some stock dialogue OK
Favorite color blue Favorite food
sardines

JANE
How do you feel about part 1 of your new
film

ZISSOU
(pause)
Why How do you feel about part 1 of my
new film

JANE
(reluctantly)
Well I’m honest you know I don’t think
I should --

ZISSOU
Just say it

JANE
(pause)
I thought aspects of it seemed slightly
fake Fake in the sense that --

ZISSOU
Wolodarsky you want to take five

Wolodarsky looks at Zissou He hesitates He gets up carrying
a beaker of bubbling liquid and goes out of the room Zissou
turns on Jane and says aggressively

ZISSOU
Did it seem fake when my best friend got
bitten in half right in front of me And
then eaten alive Screaming

Jane looks stricken Zissou points at her and says brutally

ZISSOU
I think you’re fake I think you’re a
phony and a bad reporter How does that
feel Tell me something does this seem
fake

Zissou makes a face expressing pure animal rage Jane shouts
at him

JANE
How dare you This entire article was my
idea No one else gives a shit

ZISSOU
(disturbed)
What about Si Perlman

JANE
Are you joking He’s not even covering my
expenses

Pause Zissou says carefully

ZISSOU
You’re taking something out on me

Jane looks confused She turns away and tears suddenly stream
down her face Zissou hesitates

ZISSOU
Stop crying What’s the deal here I’m
just trying to defend myself

Jane looks back to Zissou furious

JANE
Well you did a great job Congratu-
lations Youll make a terrific father

EXT GARDEN DAY

Ned comes around the corner onto the path carrying two full
bags of trash He stops suddenly

Klaus is in front of him blocking the way

KLAUS
So you really think youre a Zissou

NED
(pause)

KLAUS

NED
Klaus don’t call me --

KLAUS
And another thing it’s the Steve Zissou
show It’s not the Ned show

Klaus slaps Ned briskly in face Ned looks stunned

KLAUS
You hear me

NED
(pause)
I do sir

Klaus turns away and starts up the path The garden lamps
flicker on

NED
Klaus if you ever touch me again I’1l
kick your goddamn teeth out Is that

Klaus stops He looks back to Ned He laughs to himself self-
consciously and says trying to sound intimidating while
searching for the words

KLAUS
Not if I don’t see you first sonny

INT ZISSOU HOUSE NIGHT

cardboard box in his hand He is dressed in his striped
pajamas Ned sits on the edge of the bed looking down at the
floor

ZISSOU
We got to watch ourselves around this
Jane character Don’t tell her anything
personal and if you’re in doubt about
something change the subject and look
for me This bull-dyke’s got something
against us
Zissou starts to close the door Ned finally looks up

NED
(without looking up)
I don’t think she’s a lesbian She’s
pregnant

ZISSOU
Bull-dykes can get pregnant Anyway I’d
back-out now but we need the press See

Zissou stops and waits Ned says quietly

NED
When did you first hear about me

Zissou looks away He thinks for a minute He looks back to

Ned

Silence Ned nods Zissou goes out and closes the door He

ZISSOU
Around five years ago I guess I read it
in an article about myself

NED
(pause)
Did you believe it

ZISSOU
(shrugs)
It was in the paper I assumed they
checked their facts

NED
Then why didn’t you contact me

ZISSOU
(pause)
Because I hate fathers and I never
wanted to be one

predicting but something’s going to
happen He’s got a son I’ve never heard

you through the copy department

(pause)
You were probably right though What am
I doing here I miss you and -- God I

adventurer

ELEANOR
Don’t call yourself that If somebody
says it about you OK But --

over the sound of the plane

to inflate but it’s great once you’re up
here

She offers Zissou a stick of gum He shakes his

head She puts one in her mouth They look down past their
feet at the Belafonte below

ZISSOU
Im sorry I made you cry the other day

Anne-Marie follows him through another hatch and they start
climbing a spiral staircase that winds upwards A school of
fish swims by outside

ANNE-MARIE
Wait a second Steve This isn’t the
procedure

There is a loud crashing sound from below Zissou stops and
looks down the stairwell Wolodarsky yells up to him

WOLODARSKY (0S)
Steve one of the interns just fell down
the stairs with the main tracking
processor

ZISSOU
Well make sure we steal the back-up

Zissou and Anne-Marie approach the top of the staircase
Outside the cylinder is the water’s surface

ANNE -MARIE
Are you listening to me Eleanor told
me --

ZISSOU

Shut up before you jinx us Anne-Marie

Anne-Marie stops She looks furious She turns and walks back
down the staircase Zissou goes up out the door onto the
platform at the top of the structure

Ogata is fishing from the railing in the rain

ZISSOU
You catching anything

Ogata shakes his head Zissou hands the espresso machine to
the intern with the curly hair

ZISSOU
Hook this up and make me a latte

The intern nods Zissou opens an umbrella He takes out a
joint and lights it He checks his watch The interns start
coming out with crates and boxes They set them on the
platform and go back inside for more Ned appears in the
doorway He stands next to Zissou Zissou sighs

ZISSOU
You know cubbie’s kind of a sucker-
maker but she’s got some moves

NED
I agree

ZISSOU
Tf she wasn’t a bull-dyke I think I
might have a little bit of a thing for
her
Ned turns to Zissou blankly
EXT OCEAN DUSK

The Belafonte runs at full speed on an open sea under grey
skies

INT CARGO HOLD NIGHT

A storage room at the bottom of the ship Folding chairs have
been set up among the suitcases crates and boxes The
exercise equipment and espresso machine from Hennessey’s sea-
laboratory are also there

Zissou and Wolodarsky sit at a radar monitor connected to a
large jumble of electronic gadgets stacked precariously on
top of one another and fastened together with rubber bands
and duct tape There are cords and wires all over the room

Ned Jane Klaus Ogata Anne-Marie and Bill watch intently
They have flashlights and candles Wolodarsky points toa
large blip near the edge of the screen

WOLODARSKY
If the creature continues on its current
migratory route our paths should
converge in less than four days

ZISSOU
(instantly)
I want to get there in three Ogata
check the -

NED
Vladimir what is this blip over here

Ned points to a smaller fainter blip near the center of the
screen

WOLODARSKY
I don’t know I’ve been trying to figure
that out We might have both of them
mixed up or it could be the other way
around Anyway we’ll be right on top of
it first thing in the morning

Jane looks to Ned impressed Zissou says grudgingly

ZISSOU
Good eye Ned

NED
Thank you Should we investigate it

Everyone turns to Zissou He looks slightly irritated

ZISSOU
Yeah We’1l do a quick dive at six AM and
scope out this phantom signal -- it’s

probably just one of Hennessey’s research

ZISSOU (cont d)

turtles -- but I want to be back on the
road by lunch

CUT TO

Zissou pulling Ned aside as the rest of the group walks out
of the cargo hold and starts up the stairs Renzo stays
behind listening to Wolodarsky play a composition on his
keyboard Zissou says to Ned confidentially

ZISSOU
Do me favor will you Next time you get
a hot idea in front of the reporter
whisper it in my ear first Otherwise I
look like kind of a daydream-johnny you
know

INT SPA NIGHT

Ned floats in the jacuzzi Jane sits on the edge across from
him with her feet in the water They both have on Team Zissou
swimsuits and Ned wears a pair of diving goggles The air is
filled with steam Jane says in disbelief

JANE
You let him change your name

NED
Well we changed it together

JANE
What was it before

NED
I left Kentucky as Edward Plimpton

JANE
(indignant)
That’s a million times better Change it
back Ned I really don’t see you as a
Kingsley Zissou

NED
(sighs)
Yeah probably me neither Anyway
I don’t know if I even belong here Do
you think Steve and I have a family
resemblance

Jane reaches out to Ned and lifts his goggles off his face
onto the top of his head She looks at him for a minute

JANE
No

NED
I guess it doesn’t really matter anyway

JANE
(pause)
Why the f are you paying for this movie
out of your own pocket

NED
(hesitates)
Well I think it’s a good investment Or
besides I don’t have anything better to
do with my money anyway I’m alone now

Ned puts his goggles back on and sinks lower into the water
Jane watches him curiously

NED
I admire the man He inspires people

JANE
That may very well be true but he’s
also --

NED
(gently)
So what Jane

Jane hesitates Ned says sincerely

NED
He’s not taking advantage of me

JANE
(pause)
OK

Ned and Jane stare at each other in silence The condensation
on Ned’s goggles fogs them over completely

NED
I feel bad for you and that baby

JANE
(pause)
Don’t feel bad for us
Silence Ned shrugs

NED
Here

Ned holds out Jane’s miniature sparkling sand-dollar It
hangs on a pink thread

NED
I stole it back and strung it on some
peppermint dental floss in case you want
to wear it like a necklace

Jane puts the string around her neck She looks at Ned and
smiles She moves along the edge closer to him She kisses
him on the lips Ned says quietly

NED
I’ve only had two girlfriends in my life
That I’ve gone to bed with I mean

Jane looks surprised then dazed

JANE
Wow That makes me want to cry

The door bursts open Ogata and Pelé rush into the room and
jump into the jacuzzi Pelé leans back and puts on a sleeping
mask Ogata tears the wax paper wrapping off a ham sandwich
and takes a bite

INT JANE’S CABIN NIGHT

Jane’s clothes papers and junk-food wrappers are strewn all
over the room Zissou stands at the desk reading one of
Jane’s notebooks He has a crowbar in his hand He turns the
page Jane appears in the doorway with a towel wrapped around
her Her hair is wet She hesitates She says loudly

JANE
Woah

Zissou looks to Jane and holds up the notebook

ZISSOU

Are you happy with the piece Jane
JANE

(shocked)

What are you --
ZISSOU

Am I No
JANE

Put that down

ZISSOU
I assume I’m Mr Z I’m sorry you think
my hat is -- what was the word

(checking Jane’s notes)
Contrived And that

Zissou flips to another page He reads at random

ZISSOU
The Zissou of my childhood represents --
(frowning)
-- every dream I’ve come to regret What

Why

Jane crosses over to Zissou and grabs her notebook out of his
hand She says bitterly

JANE
I’m going to have to start locking my
f-ing door

ZISSOU
It was locked I kicked it in
(irritated)
Why don’t you just curse

JANE
(pause)
Because I’m trying to get out of the
habit before I have my fucking baby

ZISSOU
(realizing)
Oh That makes sense Well clean this
room up anyway It looks like it was hit
by a goddamn typhoon

JANE
Get out

Zissou sighs He takes off his hat and looks at it
ZISSOU
Please don’t make fun of me I just
wanted to flirt with you

Jane hesitates

ZISSOU
I’1l get an intern to fix the door

The first Englishman arrives with the pink document and hands
it to Hennessey Hennessey reads it and frowns

HENNESSEY
This is a message from the IMU Coast
Guard Apparently some crooked fuckers
broke into my sea-lab yesterday

SWIMSUIT ENGLISHMAN
How awful Did they nick anything

HENNESSEY
It doesn’t say They probably just
trashed the place
(gritting his teeth)
I’m so pissed I want to spit

Hennessey crumples the document in his fist He spits on the
deck He uncrumples the document and looks at it again He
says to the first Englishman

check their equipment They carry nets and shovels and bags
of gear Zissou has a spear-gun Jane Anne-Marie and the
interns stand gathered around watching and helping Vikram
films the scene

Zissou plugs a cord into a socket on the side of his helmet
and adjusts an antenna on the top of his head He says to
Jane

ZISSOU
Supposedly Cousteau and his cronies
invented the idea of putting walkie-
talkies into the helmet but we made ours
with a special rabbit ear on top so you
can pipe in some music

Zissou motions for Ned Klaus and Ogata to follow him back
into the trees Ned says to Zissou over his radio head-set

NED
Would it be possible for me to address
you as Dad in this scene

ZISSOU
(instantly)
No Why

Ned hesitates He looks embarrassed

NED
Oh Excuse me I’m sorry I forgot you --

(bewildered)
Where you coming from jack-off Shit

ZISSOU
(to himself)
It’s not a bad impulse though Some kind
of nick-name Not that one -- it’s too
specific -- but try to think of something
else
NED
(hesitates)

Another name

OGATA
How about Steevsy

ZISSOU
That’s good Try it What were you going
to say before

Silence Ned says simply

NED
Good luck Steevsy

ZISSOU
Fantastic Let’s go

Zissou leads the other three swimming into the clearing

glass Zissou finishes performing his narration

ZISSOU
We examine the crash-site but are
careful not to disturb the forensic
evidence
(to Renzo)
How was that

RENZO
Not bad The first take was a little
faster Here’s the footage of Ned saving
your life

ZISSOU

I told you not to print that Vikram He
didn’t save my life That’s not the way I
want this sub-plot to go

turbine sticking through the side of the fuselage A thermos
with barnacles all over it falls from the luggage rack and
clunks him on the head He looks up and sees a large metal
trunk shifting precariously above him He reaches up and puts
his hand against it to stop it from falling on him A
miniature sea-scorpion circles near his neck He tugs at his
leg violently with a look of panic on his face under his
diving mask

Ned swims over and kneels down beside Zissou He pulls and
twists on part of a crushed seat-back pressed against
Zissou’s ankle An arm-rest breaks off and Zissou’s leg is
freed Zissou and Ned dodge away as the trunk crashes down
and the sea-scorpion darts away

Zissou swims directly into the camera and puts his hand over
the lens

INT HALLWAY DAY

Ned comes down the stairs and sees Klaus at the end of the
corridor He pauses

NED
Could I have a moment with you Klaus

Klaus looks to Ned He frowns Ned walks down the hallway and
stops in front of Klaus They stare at each other

KLAUS
What

Ned slaps Klaus in the face Klaus looks taken aback

KLAUS
Why’d you do that

NED
Because I owed you one

KLAUS
(upset)
But you gave me a warning already You
stood up for yourself

NED
I still owed you one

KLAUS
Well now I owe you one

NED
No Now we’re even

Klaus looks confused He sounds highly emotional
KLAUS

Why’re you doing this to me He’s not my
father you know I don’t have that

I didn’t see it boss

Well keep your eyes peeled

Zissou looks through the windshield into the fog with a pair
of boy scout binoculars He lowers them

ZISSOU
Klaus check who’s on watch I’1ll be in

stomach He feels the baby kick He looks startled
EVE Ter

NED
Is that him

JANE
Uh-huh That’s him

NED
I’ve never felt a baby in someones
stomach before

Ned sits up He seems very moved

NED
I think you’1l make a very good single
mother

Jane smiles sadly She spits out her gum into her hand She
drops it into a glass of water She says softly

JANE
Thanks

NED
Although it puts you both at a tremendous
disadvantage

Pause Ned and Jane start to make-out passionately with their
hands all over each other Jane pulls-off Ned’s shirt Ned
suddenly looks concerned

NED
You know Steve has a little bit of a
thing for you

JANE
(surprised)
Why do you say that

NED
Because he told me

JANE
(intrigued)
Really I thought he hated my guts

NED
Well I think you hurt his feelings but
that doesn’t mean --

JANE
He says I hurt his feelings

Jane shakes her head She says philosophically

JANE
That’s so f-ed up

Ned considers this He shrugs One of the albino dolphin
scouts stares in through a porthole

Pelé sits at the back of the ship playing a David Bowie song
on his guitar He does not notice the speedboat approaching
again through the mist behind the ship As it nears the
Belafonte it becomes apparent that its passengers are
fourteen Indonesian men with machetes and machine-guns One
of them raises a bamboo ladder into the air

INT SPA DAY

Zissou sits alone in the sauna smoking a joint with his eyes
closed He is dressed in a swimsuit He has an ashtray
balanced on his knee The air is filled with steam

There is a loud cracking sound from the decks above followed
by a low rumble Zissou frowns He opens his eyes There is a
sudden rush of footsteps flooding down the stairs Someone
pounds on the door Zissou hesitates

ZISSOU
Yeah

KLAUS (0S)
Steve would you mind opening the door

Silence Zissou takes one last puff on the joint puts it
out and sets the ashtray aside He stands up and goes to the
door He rubs the condensation off the porthole

into his temple a machete held against his neck and a fist
gripping a handful of his hair

Hi Steevsy

Uh hi What’s going on

NED
(shrugs)
Just doing a little book-reading

There is some sudden shoving and yelling in Indonesian in the
hallway

ZISSOU (0S)
I guess you better let us in

Ned gets up and looks under the door He sees Zissou’s powder
blue slippers and the dirty feet of seven men in worn-out
boots tattered sandals and sneakers with duct-tape holding

them together -- plus the tip of a machete He is stunned
NED
What’s happening Is that -- Are those hi-
jackers

ZIssou (0S)
Well we call them pirates out here Ned
You’re supposed to be on watch by the
way

Ned checks his watch He looks horrified

NED
Oh my God You’re right

Ned opens the door The pirates instantly burst into the
room They have scars on their faces and wild looks in their
eyes They chaotically manhandle Zissou Ned and Jane
screaming and swinging machetes

CUT TO

Zissou Ned and Jane on the floor tied-up with ropes and
twine The door is closed and they are alone in the room

ZISSOU
You know if we had a little warning we
could’ve fought these guys off

NED
(upset)
I’m sorry Steve

ZISSOU

This is why we’re supposed to have our
Glocks on us at all times

(yells at the ceiling)
Even the interns Anne-Marie

(calmly)
So tell me again -- you’re reading to
each other in French

NED
No it’s in English It was translated

ZISSOU
Well you know you’re not supposed to go
into each other’s cabins on a boat

JANE
Why not

ZISSOU
It’s just kind of an unwritten maritime
rule when you’re at sea Especially for
the goddamn look-out
(screaming at Ned)
I’m furious at you

NED
(shaken)
I’m so sorry

ZISSOU
Me too pal You hung us out to dry You
know if we don’t handle this right
were going to all get murdered
including her unborn British child

Jane bursts into tears Ned looks devastated The door opens
A pirate wearing a kamikaze headband comes in goes over to
Ned and pounds him in the head with the butt of his machete
Ned falls over knocked-out cold

Zissou kicks and thrashes around but is bound fast to a pipe
on the wall The pirate drags Ned out the door Zissou yells
after him desperately

ZISSOU
I’m going to kill you for that you
asshole I’m going to hit you so fucking
hard you won’t --

The pirate closes the door

ZISSOU
Please don’t hurt him

Zissou and Jane coming up the stairs together with their
hands tied behind their backs One of the pirates follows
them with a machine-gun

ZISSOU
Watch me I’11l let you know when I’m
ready to make a move

JANE
(urgently)
Steve it’s way safer for us to just do
what they say They probably only want
our money and jewels and shit

ZISSOU
Uh-huh well how am I supposed to finish
my movie then

Zissou Jane and the pirate walk out onto the deck A dog
with only three legs runs wildly over to them snarling The
entire crew is lined-up facing a wall down on their knees
blindfolded with their arms bound Zissou looks shocked

ZISSOU
Fuck Jesus Holy fuck

KLAUS
They’re going to kill us Steve

Zissou looks to Klaus Klaus is sobbing Zissou yells to him

ZISSOU
I’m patting you on the back right now
Klausie Don’t be scared I’m going to
get us through this everybody Ogata
Como esta pal

Zissou looks over the side of the ship The pirates are
loading cans of fuel into their speedboat A skinny thirteen-
year-old Indonesian boy huddles terrified at the rudder Ned
lies unconscious tied-up on the floor partially stuffed
into a potato sack There is blood all over the side of his
face Zissou looks as if he is about to cry He yells
strangely

ZISSOU
Wake up Ned-o I’m sorry I yelled at
you
(to the pirates)
I need to speak to the man in charge
fellas

The pirate with the kamikaze headband holds a Glock to the
back of an intern’s head and shouts at him hysterically

ZISSOU
Don’t point that at him He’s an unpaid
intern

Zissou slowly moves his bound hands in front of the gun onto
the back of the intern’s head He notices Vikram has one of
the cameras in his hand

ZISSOU
What kind of coverage you getting
Vikram

VIKRAM

I just kept it rolling until they put
this hood over my head

Bill and one of the pirates start an animated discussion in
Indonesian The pirate shouts something to his colleagues
Zissou says to himself

ZISSOU
Bill speaks their language
(yelling)
What’s he saying Billy

BILL
Apparently they’re going to take a
hostage and they’ve chosen Ned but --

Bill holds up a finger and listens as the pirates negotiate
with one another He nods

BILL
Yes Now that they’ve learned I speak
Indonesian they seem to have changed
their minds

Five of the pirates surround Bill One of them takes out a
buck-knife An older pirate comes out of the bridge He wears
a baseball cap He and the other pirates talk rapidly with
one another

BILL
Do we have a vault He wants to know
about the vault

ZISSOU
(blankly)
There’s no vault

BILL
He says Give us the currency I believe
that’s the word He appears to have seen
one of your films

CUT TO

A small jerry-rigged television set behind a cheap
restaurant kitchen in the slums of Jakarta The pirates watch
a fifteen-year-old episode of The Life Aquatic Some of them
appear to be cooks or waiters In the program Zissou and
Klaus sit beside Esteban as he opens a yellow safe on-board
the ship He shows the camera bills and coins from various
countries Zissou explains in voice-over

ZISSOU (V0)
Our vault contains at least ten different
currencies from all over the world at any
given moment and we are prepared for
every kind of financial necessity

The pirates look intrigued

CUT TO

Zissou staring at Bill

ZISSOU
Tell him times have changed

Four pirates come out onto the deck carrying the yellow safe
Zissou sighs

ZISSOU
There goes Ned’s inheritance

BILL
Should I try to negotiate with them

ZISSOU
(pause)
Yeah Try that Tell them to get off my
boat right now or theres going to be a
Major shit-storm

Bill calmly addresses the pirates in Indonesian Zissou
interrupts

ZISSOU
Did you say shit-storm

BILL
(hesitates)
Well I’m trying to be more --

ZISSOU
(sharply)
Translate what I’m saying Bill

Pause Bill nods He translates more aggressively to the
pirates The largest of the pirates punches Bill in the
stomach Bill doubles over onto the deck Zissou looks
surprised

ZISSOU
Woah Woah Woah Step it down a notch

Bill lies moaning on the deck The large pirate picks him up
and heaves him over the side of the ship into a net He is
lowered from a pulley to the speedboat with a crate of
bananas Ned is hoisted back up and thrown on the deck
Zissou calls out to him

ZISSOU
Ned-o Can you hear me

Ned does not respond Zissou and Jane are forced down onto
their knees and blindfolded Zissou yells desperately

ZISSOU
Well get you back Billy Is everybody
else safe Anne-Marie You OK honey

Anne-Marie sounds miserable Her voice cracks

ANNE-MARIE
No I’m not I told you these were
unprotected waters

Zissou shakes his head and all the energy seems to drain from
his body He says to himself in a pained voice

ZISSOU
What a fucking nightmare

Dark clouds roll in above the ship Zissou turns to Jane and
says suddenly

ZISSOU
Be cool on this shit OK cubbie I mean
at least try to show both sides

JANE
(quietly)
I need to find a baby for this father

ZISSOU
(pause)
Yeah I think I know what you mean

Zissou nods He wriggles his arms testing the knots Thunder
rumbles in the distance Zissou takes a deep breath He says
calmly to himself in a loud clear voice

ZISSOU
OK This is it Zissou Here we go

Klaus turns toward Zissou He hesitates

KLAUS
Steve What are you --

ZISSOU
(yelling)
I said get your ass the hell off of my
boat

Zissou jumps up and whips off his blindfold He throws a

lever on a valve and steam shoots out of a pipe He punches
one of the pirates in the face He grabs the pirate’s pistol
throws him overboard and starts shooting Bullets ricochet
A hose snaps open and water bursts out An electrical fuse-

box breaks apart showering sparks The pirate with the
kamikaze headband holds a machete over the intern with the
curly black hair Zissou shoots the pirate in the neck The
pirate clutches at his throat moaning but manages to chop
into the intern’s shoulder

Eight of the pirates are already in their speedboat The
remaining four burst into frenzied screaming and shooting
They beat and kick at Zissou’s crew One of them throws a
hand grenade Zissou hollers

ZISSOU
Grenade

Everyone dives for cover There is an explosion near the back
of the ship The pirates scramble over the railings jump
into their speedboat and race away Zissou stands at the
prow of the Belafonte and empties his pistol at the
speedboat He throws the gun after them Pause He says to
himself

ZISSOU
I’ve never seen a bond company stooge
stick his neck out like that

Zissou shakes his head The pirate with the kamikaze headband
lies face down on the deck in a pool of blood Zissou stands
over him and says defiantly

ZISSOU
I know this asshole I told him I was
going to kill him

Zissou turns to his passengers and crew They are all looking
at him with their blindfolds on The ship is in flames behind
them An electrical storm crackles on the horizon Strange
lightning bolts shoot upwards Pelé tilts his head curiously
with tears running down his cheeks from under his blindfold

PELE
What’s that sound Is that --

ZISSOU
The Arctic Night-lights yeah

As if the natural world’s been turned
upside-down -- Lord Mandrake

The look-out tower Zissou stands with Klaus and Ogata above
the blackened smoldering ship Pelé sprays a fire
extinguisher on the bridge below Everyone on deck looks
shell-shocked Zissou shakes his head and says sadly

going to bury him at sea

OGATA
(hesitates)
Shouldnt we give him to the authorities
or something

ZISSOU
(pause)
No
KLAUS

Zissou nods One of the interns comes out onto the tower
shivering His arm is in a bloody sling Zissou says gently

back

KLAUS
(pause)
I hear what you’re saying but I think
you misjudge the guy

INT HALLWAY NIGHT

Zissou comes down the corridor Klaus is waiting outside the
dining room Loud shouting and commotion comes from inside
Klaus whispers urgently

KLAUS
Steevsy I think the crew might be ready
to mutiny

Pause Zissou cracks open the door to the dining room and
looks inside He says wearily

Z2ISSOU
Ah man What a drag

EXT MAIN DECK DAY

The next morning Zissou Ned Klaus Pelé and Ogata stand
with their heads bowed and their hands clasped in front of
them They are gathered around the body of the dead pirate
It is wrapped in a red and white gingham-checked tablecloth
The three-legged dog sits beside it Ned is covered with
bruises stitches and bandages He leans on a cane Vikram
films the scene

Klaus unfolds a a bundle of little scraps of paper He clears
his throat and begins

KLAUS
St Paul said to the Corinthians --

ZISSOU
(looking off)
Holy shit Son of a bitch
(to Vikram)
Cut

Vikram keeps filming An enormous space-age highly
futuristic yacht made of plastic glass and titanium pulls-
up dangerously close alongside the Belafonte and comes to a
full stop Twenty-five men in white uniforms throw lines
jump down steps run across catwalks and watch with
binoculars Operation Hennessey is printed on the crew
members’ caps and across the side of the ship

Hennessey stands at the prow in his lab coat and pink
cashmere scarf with an elephant gun cocked over his shoulder

His Japanese television crew is circled around him He yells
over a PA system

HENNESSEY
This is Captain Hennessey Weve come in
response to your distress signal Remain

calm and -- good God is that you
Steven
ZISSOU
(to Ogata)

Run downstairs and put a tarp over
anything with Hennessey written on it

Ogata nods and goes inside Klaus motions to the dead pirate
at their feet

KLAUS
What about this guy

ZISSOU
(pause)
Just throw him in

INT HENNESSEY’S QUARTERS DAY

An immaculate polished-teak sitting room There are numerous
control panels with blinking displays and buttons A silver-
nitrate print of the photograph of Lord Mandrake is framed on
the wall Hennessey sits draped over a camel’s hair sofa with
a glass of white wine in his hand Zissou is in a pink silk
armchair with fringe on it across from him

The three-legged dog growls at Zissou’s side Silence

HENNESSEY
Your engine blew up and all your fuel’s
been stolen Is that correct

ZISSOU
Uh-huh

HENNESSEY
Well I certainly know how you feel Some
crooked fuckers just stripped my sea-lab
you know

Zissou hesitates He mumbles

ZISSOU
Probably the same dudes

HENNESSEY
(shrugs)
I can tow you as far as Portau-Patois
I’1l need your signature on this invoice
first It accounts for the expenses of
the rescue operation as well my time and
that of my crew

Hennessey hands Zissou a bill Zissou examines it

ZISSOU
This is more than the budget of my whole
project

HENNESSEY

It’s an estimate

Zissou sighs He re-reads the invoice The dog scratches at
the sides of Zissou’s armchair

HENNESSEY
What’s your dog’s name

ZISSOU
(pause)
Cody

Hennessey nods He rolls up a newspaper He goes over to the
dog still scratching at the chair and swats it hard across
the body The dog yelps and recoils

HENNESSEY
Be still Cody

Zissou looks startled He frowns and pets the dog Hennessey
sits back down on the sofa Zissou holds up the invoice

ZISSOU
I have to run this by my bond company
stooge
HENNESSEY
He’s been kidnapped
ZISSOU
(hesitates)

That’s true I got to rescue him first

HENNESSEY
Sign it now or I’m leaving you out here

Pause Zissou signs the bill Hennessey takes it Something
catches Zissou’s eye in an aquarium across the room He

frowns He points at it and looks to Hennessey Hennessey
nods knowingly

Zissou gets up and walks over to the aquarium Hennessey
turns off the overhead lights and joins him Plastic tubes
and wires stick out of the water and a digital thermometer
hangs on the edge of the tank connected to a computer There
is a navy blue squid-like creature the size of a football
swimming figure-eight patterns and turning itself inside out
and back again It has one green eye

Hennessey says quietly

HENNESSEY
Hydronicus Inverticus

ZISSOU
(awestruck)
A rat-tail envelope fish This is the
first one Ive ever seen
(looking to Hennessey)
How much you want for him

HENNESSEY
Not for sale I’m afraid

Zissou taps on the glass and stares at the creature It
breathes audibly

HENNESSEY
All right Let him go back to sleep

CUT TO

Hennessey holding the door open for Zissou and the three-
legged dog to walk across a gangplank back to the Belafonte
Hennessey has his arm around Zissou’s shoulder He wears a
neat leather supply belt around his waist Zissou notices it
and says distractedly

ZISSOU
Where’d you get that little fanny pack
from

HENNESSEY
(suspiciously)
What My supply belt It’s by Hartwell
and Kent Why

ZISSOU
(shrugs)
Not a bad crew gift
INSERT

HENNESSEY
(suddenly)
Oh I dined with Eleanor last weekend by
the way She’s summering at my villa in
West Port-au-Patois don’t you know Say
how’s Team Zissou holding up without her

A line being drawn on a wooden floor with a piece of chalk

CUT TO

Zissou on the deck of the Belafonte His arms are folded in
front of his chest His crew stands across from him The
three-legged dog sits beside him growling

ZISSOU
The first thing that goes through a
captain’s head when he hears there’s low
morale going around is What’d I do Is
it all my fault Well he’s probably
right Most of us have been together a
long time and there’s others who were
here before that Do you guys not like me
anymore I mean what am I supposed to
do I don’t know

(pause)

Look if you’re not against me don’t
cross this line If yes do OK I love
you all

Klaus immediately steps across the line He looks to Zissou

Zissou looks pained and stunned He can barely manage to say

ZISSOU
Are you -- are you sure

KLAUS
(confidently)
Yes I am

ZISSOU
I don’t understand Why

KLAUS
(confused)
What do you mean Wait a second What are
we doing I thought you said cross the
line if --

ZISSOU
Cross the line if you want to quit

Klaus quickly goes back to the other side

KLAUS
Do it again I misunderstood

The interns whisper and murmur with each other They all
cross the line So does Anne-Marie Silence

INT RADIO ROOM DAY

A tiny cabin with telephone books from numerous exotic cities
stacked on shelves and hundreds of telephone numbers
scribbled on the walls Jane sits alone at a little desk
talking on the wireless She says into the microphone

JANE

Hi Ross You’re probably at lunch which
is why I’m calling now I got your
corrections on the proofs They’re fine

(pause)
We got attacked by pirates I feel like

Anyway take care of yourself Jane

INT NED’S CABIN DAY

Ned and Jane sit side by side on his bunk holding hands
There is a paper sack on a chair next to the bed Ned does
not look at Jane Jane sounds distraught

JANE
I’1l probably just stay with my weirdo
sister until I get things figured out
You understand right

Ned nods He says quietly
NED
Yes that sounds like a good decision

Will you write to me

JANE
Of course Give me the address

Ned reaches into the paper sack and takes out a stack of
envelopes
NED

Well actually I went ahead and stamped
and self-addressed fifty or so envelopes

to make it easier for you

Ned hands Jane the envelopes Jane looks touched

JANE
Thanks I’1l use them

NED

Each one has three blank pages in it

here’s a pen

and

Ned gives Jane a blue and white ballpoint pen with four
different colors that click from the tip Pause

JANE

Maybe Im going to write you a letter

right now

NED
(pleased)
OK

Jane laughs She kisses Ned on the cheek and then the lips

I

JANE

I bet I’m going to really miss you Ned
NED

I’m going to miss you too In fact

(with a lump in his throat)
I don’t know I feel like my heart’s
getting broken I guess I’m over-
reacting
Jane hesitates She looks suddenly lost

JANE
Is that really true

Ned nods sadly
INT HALLWAY DAY

Jane comes down the corridor toward her cabin

She has tears

in her eyes She opens her door and starts to go inside
Zissou yells from the stairwell at the end of the hallway
Jane points to her packed suitcases lined up inside her
cabin Zissou looks disappointed He walks wearily toward

her

ZISSOU
That was all off the record cubbie That
whole deal Actually I’m surprised you
didn’t cross the line yourself

JANE
What line

ZISSOU
(annoyed)
The line I drew on the deck just now
Weren’t you up there

JANE
No

ZISSOU
(frustrated)
Youre kidding That was one of the most
dramatic things that’s ever happened on
this boat I just lost all my best
interns I thought you were supposed to
be covering this story

JANE
You just said it was all off the record

ZISSOU
Yeah but you didn’t know that

JANE
Well I was down here packing

ZISSOU
So you are leaving You’re jumping ship
on me

JANE
I’m going to scrap the article

ZISSOU
(hurt)
You mean you’re not even going to write
the cover story on me Man I just don’t
have any stature any more

JANE
I’m sorry Steve Everything just got too
weird that’s all

ZISSOU
Yeah but I gave you a goddamn show-
stopper out there We got --
(pause)
Are you sleeping with Ned

JANE
(hesitates)
That’s none of your business

ZISSOU
OK but --

JANE
No I’m not

Zissou nods He sighs

ZISSOU
You’re going to miss the jaguar shark or
whatever it is if it actually exists
(suddenly)
Are you crying What’s wrong Jane

Jane shrugs Zissou says gently

ZISSOU
You cry easily don’t you

Zissou takes out a Team Zissou handkerchief and dries the
tears on Jane’s cheeks

INT RADIO ROOM NIGHT

Zissou sits wearily at the wireless Drakoulias’ voice comes
over the line

DRAKOULIAS (VO)

moment Legally I’m a fugitive Now I

ZISSOU
(upset)
Wait a second They stole my budget The

creek What am I supposed to do

DRAKOULIAS (V0O)
long pause)
Well I must say nothing’s jumping to --
Phillip any suggestions
(pause)
No He’s shaking his head

EXT HENNESSEY’S YACHT DAY

A sailor in a crisp white Operation Hennessey uniform
stands in the crow’s nest above the ship surrounded by
computers and high-tech navigation equipment He raises a
pair of digital binoculars to his eyes He lowers them
suddenly He reaches toward a button on a panel and starts to
say something -- but is interrupted by Klaus’ voice yelling

KLAUS (0S)
Port-au-Patois Dead ahead

The sailor turns and looks quickly behind him He holds up
his digital binoculars

CUT TO

A digital binocular shot of Klaus standing alone on the look-
out tower of the Belafonte watching the horizon with Zissou’s
boy scout binoculars He picks up a bell and rings it
violently He shouts at the top of his lungs

KLAUS
Land ho

CUT TO

The sailor lowering his binoculars He frowns

EXT OCEAN DAY

Hennessey’s ship tows the Belafonte into the bay at Port-au-
Patois

EXT MAIN DECK DAY

The interns stand in a cluster in front of Zissou with all of
their duffel bags and knapsacks Zissou says tensely

ZISSOU
No I can’t give you full credit but Im
not going to flunk you either You’re
all going to get incompletes

The interns look furious One of them mutters

INTERN
This is bullshit

Zissou walks across the deck to the railing He takes out his
passport and checks it He puts on his red cap Ned goes over
to him smoking his pipe Zissou examines the cuts and
bruises on Ned’s face

ZISSOU
They bashed you up pretty good I guess

Ned nods Pause He says quietly

NED
Steevesy I just wanted to say in
regards to the argument we had during the
attack because I still feel upset about
it and also in terms of the nick-names
well I just wanted to say that -- what
are we to each other Am I --

ZISSOU
(sharply)
Let’s just keep it in the moment OK
Ned-o

Ned looks startled He says reluctantly

NED
OK
(suddenly snapping)
Why What does that mean

Zissou hesitates He shakes his head and waves his hands He
seems confused and agitated

ZISSOU
Strike that Look why don’t you just
decide what we are to each other and
whatever you come up with is fine with
me OK

Zissou climbs down a ladder onto the diving platform Klaus
is pouring fuel from a gasoline can into the tank on a Zodiak
motorboat Zissou sighs

ZISSOU
Klaus take down those interns mailing
addresses and make sure they all get
fanny packs Hartwell and Kent

EXT HARBOR DAY
Pelé drives Zissou to the marina in the Zodiak
EXT PORT-AU-PATOIS DAY

A deeply impoverished tropical island There are beggars and

children and soldiers with machine-guns Zissou and a small

Filipino driver race through a shanty-town in a taxi with two
Port-au-Patois flags on the corners of the hood

EXT VILLA DAY

A large house on the shore with a woven bamboo and grass
roof There are gardens palm trees and a goldfish pond A
collection of small chrome buildings observation towers and
a geodesic dome surround the main structure Zissou’s taxi
waits in the road Zissou knocks on the ornately carved front
door He watches some tiny black frogs leaping around on the
path doing little back-flips Hennessey Villa is written on
the pavement beneath them in chrome mosaic tile

Eleanor opens the door She is dressed in a black leotard and
pink tights with a cream-colored scarf wrapped around her
waist Her hair is tied back into a knot and loose strands
stick to the sweat on her forehead Classical music plays
loudly from the next room

ELEANOR
Oh shit What do you want

ZISSOU
Do you mind if I butter you up a little
before I answer that question

ELEANOR
Yes I do Tell me now

ZISSOU
I need some money to get the boat out of
hock and rescue my bond company stooge
who got kidnapped Could we ask your
parents to loan it to me

ELEANOR
No

ZISSOU
(pause)
OK Could I go ahead and butter you up
anyway It took me two and half hours to
get out here

INT VILLA DAY

Zissou follows Eleanor through a hallway into a living room
with grass-mat floors chaises-longues and oil lamps There
are photographs of Hennessey with various celebrities and
dignitaries on the walls The sun is setting on the ocean
outside Eleanor turns down the volume on the stereo

A tall Spanish man in a leotard waits in the next room
stretching with one foot on a table Zissou sees him and
frowns He points at the Spanish man

ZISSOU
Who’s that dude

ELEANOR
Oh That’s my research assistant Javier
Javier te presento Steve

The Spanish man stands up and shakes Zissou’s hand He and
Eleanor exchange a few words in Spanish and the Spanish man
goes outside Zissou watches out the window as the Spanish
man runs down the stairs peeling off his leotard Zissou
sighs

Zissou bends down to examine a twenty-year-old picture of
Eleanor and Hennessey sharing a bellini in a gondola on the
Grand Canal in Venice

ZISSOU
Id be jealous about you staying at
Allie’s place except I’ve always thought
he was kind of a closet queer

Eleanor and Zissou sit across from each other in two wicker
settees There is a table in between them covered with
Eleanor’s notes charts diagrams and pictures of different

species of penguin There is also a manuscript entitled
Classic Penguins by Eleanor Zissou

Eleanor takes out a brown cigarette puts it in her mouth
and lights it

ELEANOR
Hows your father-son relationship coming
along

ZISSOU

The sub-plot Oh you mean in real life
Yeah I think Ive become something of a
father-figure to Ned Or at the very
least he’s my half-son

ELEANOR
(hesitates)
Half-son

ZISSOU

Well nobody has a lock on any of this
so I’m not sure how it all times out I
mean I want him to think of me like a
father but the fact that there’s an
outside chance he really could be my
actual biological son makes it --

(struggling)
-- very difficult for me

Eleanor nods A yellow and green lizard darts onto the arm of
Zissous settee He lets it crawl onto his hand The lizard
looks at him and yawns Zissou sighs

ZISSOU
You know I’m not big on apologizing so
Ill just skip it if it’s all the same
to you

ELEANOR
OK

ZISSOU
Anyway I’m sorry I know I haven’t been
at my best this past decade

ELEANOR
(gently)
That’s true but let’s just say it’s all
right and -- leave it be

Pause Zissou flicks the lizard onto the floor and walks
outside
EXT TERRACE DAY

Dusk The balcony of Villa Hennessey looks out over a cliff
high above the sea The Spanish man exercises on another
balcony below Zissou stands at the railing and says sadly

ZISSOU
What happened to me Did I lose my
talent Am I ever going to be good again

Eleanor comes out to join Zissou She smokes a brown
cigarette

ELEANOR
I don’t know

ZISSOU
Well it doesn’t matter anyway This is
probably the last adventure I’ve got in
me I was hoping to go out in a flash of
blazes but now I think I’1l just head
home -- unless you’re planning to sell
the island

ELEANOR
(pause)
I wonder how much I could get for it

ZISSOU
In this market Oh Eleanor
(sighs)
You were probably right all along We
should’ve had a kid together Of course
you were kind of already on the edge of
being too old but I guess maybe that’s a

cop-out

ELEANOR
It’s worse than a cop-out I was thirty-
four

Zissou nods He takes out a joint and puts it in his mouth
He says sincerely

ZISSOU
It’s good to see you Eleanor

ELEANOR
You too

Zissou leans forward and lights his joint off the cigarette
in Eleanor’s mouth

INT NED’S CABIN NIGHT

The Belafonte Ned’s room is dark The door opens Zissou
comes in and closes it behind him He looks at Ned and Jane
asleep in the bunk He says quietly

ZISSOU
I’m about to blow my stack I turn my
back and the bullshit begins

Ned opens his eyes He sits up quickly

ZISSOU
Ned youre a scumbag

Zissou turns on the lights Jane wakes up

ZISSOU
And Jane you’re a goddamn liar

JANE
(furious)
What the fuck are you doing in here

ZISSOU
What the £ are you doing in here I
warned you before about being in the
wrong cabins You were supposed to go

home

JANE
Well you convinced me to stay and finish
the story

ZISSOU

(pause)
Is it still the cover

JANE
(angrily)
I don’t fucking know

Ned gets out of bed He wears white boxer shorts He puts on
his Team Zissou pants

ZISSOU
Don’t you dare put on that uniform

NED
(hesitates)
It’s all I have with me

ZISSOU
I told you I have a little bit of a thing
for her dammit Not this one I said

NED
You said Not this one Klaus

ZISSOU
(points to Ned)
So you heard me

JANE
Youre too old for me Steve

ZISSOU
(pause)
Well you’re pregnant

JANE
I don’t respect either one of you
anyway
ZISSOU
(thrown)
Well I know why you don’t respect me
but why don’t you respect him -- because
he didn’t hit me when I burst in here
(to Ned)

I’1l tell you one thing you never
wouldve gotten away with calling me a
scumbag in my cabin

NED
I never would’ve wanted to

JANE
I meant you and Klaus He’s been a dick
to Ned

ZISSOU
(pause)
Youre right What’s the deal with that

NED
(to Zissou)
May I have a word with you privately

Zissou shouts

ZISSOU
Yeah

Zissou and Ned go out the door and close it behind them
Klaus stands at the end of the hallway in his striped
pajamas

KLAUS
Are you two fighting
ZISSOU
Ill deal with you later
(to Ned)

Follow me
Ned follows Zissou up the stairs

NED
Look Steve I know we both like her and
you’re angry and embarrassed but --

ZISSOU
You think that’s what this is about
Shit Ned What’s that bull-dyke been
telling you

NED
(suddenly)
All right I’m going to warn you now Be
a gentleman

Zissou and Ned walk down a corridor into the library The
intern with curly black hair and his arm in a sling sits ona
sofa reading a copy of Oceanographic Explorer with a picture
of Hennessey on the cover Zissou sees him and frowns

ZISSOU
What are you doing here I thought all
you interns walked out on me

INTERN
I want to help you find that shark

ZISSOU
(defiantly)
Goddammit

Zissou grips the intern’s shoulder The intern grimaces and
cries out in agony Zissou lets go of him

ZISSOU
Thank you intern You’re getting an A

Zissou and Ned walk out of the library and go up another set
of stairs

NED
His name’s Nico

ZISSOU
(confused)
Who

Zissou and Ned walk through the laboratory and go into the
kitchen Vikram stands in the pantry door with a camera on
his shoulder Ned sees him

NED
Hello Vikram

Zissou turns and sees Vikram filming them He screams

ZISSOU
Give me that camera I’m going to smash
it over your head

Zissou lunges at Vikram Vikram ducks out the back of the
pantry and disappears around the corner Zissou yells

ZISSOU
Cut

Zissou and Ned walk through the chart room and up another set
of stairs

ZISSOU
I misread you man I’m going to have to
re-think some shit

NED
(of fended)
You don’t know me You never wanted to

know me I’m just a character in your
film

ZISSOU
(hesitates)
It’s a documentary It’s all really
happening

NED
Well damn you for that

Zissou looks confounded He shakes it off He and Ned go out
the door onto the main deck Pelé sits by the railing
strumming his guitar Ogata and Renzo are with him Zissou
yells

ZISSOU
Go to sleep you sons of bitches

Ogata Pelé and Renzo look startled but make no move to go
Pause Zissou turns away and climbs up the ladder to the top
of the look-out tower Ned follows him

They stand high above the ship in silence

ZISSOU
That pregnant slut’s been playing us like
a cheap fiddle

Pause Ned says in a steely voice

NED
That’s it I’m going to fight you Steve

Zissou feints to one side and sucker-punches Ned in the face
Ned hits the floor Zissou shakes his head

ZISSOU
You never say I’m going to fight you
Steve You just smile and act natural --
and then you sucker-punch him

Ned stands up and stares at Zissou

NED
You fight your way and I’1l fight mine

ZISSOU
(patronizing)
Listen Ned Don’t try to --

Ned sucker-punches Zissou in the face Zissou hits the floor
He puts his finger to his lip and shows Ned a drop of blood

ZISSOU
I think your Team Zissou ring might’ ve
caught me on the lip

Ned takes off his ring and puts it into his pocket Jane
comes out onto the tower and stands behind Ned chewing gum
Zissou gets up He says simply

ZISSOU
You call yourself my son but I just
don’t see it
(shrugs)
Its nothing personal

Ned looks wounded Zissou points at Jane and snaps

ZISSOU
What do you want

Pause Jane blows a bubble then pops it back into her mouth
She says calmly

JANE
Nothing

ZISSOU
(annoyed)
That’s so arrogant That’s -- screw off

Jane shrugs Ned shakes his head and says humiliated

NED
I can’t believe I asked if I could call
you Dad What was I thinking Of course
you said no

ZISSOU
(pause)
I let you call me Steevsy It sounds
better

NED
(exploding)

It doesn’t mean the same thing

Silence Zissou looks disturbed Jane puts her arms around
Neds waist Ned says quietly

NED

I hadn’t planned to mention this but
just to set the record straight a week
before she killed herself my mother told
me you’d known about me since the day I
was born Is that a fact

(long pause)
Answer me Is that a fact

ZISSOU
Thats a fact

NED
I didn’t come looking for you because I
wanted to join your crew I ought to have
stayed in Kentucky where I belong --
(suddenly)
-- and now Ive made a fool of myself

Ned turns away sadly The three-legged dog starts barking
crazily on the deck below Zissou frowns He goes over to the
railing and looks down

Eleanor stands with her suitcases and a steel briefcase at
the prow of the ship over a ladder that comes up from the
water A harbor taxi idles alongside the Belafonte Fleanor
points at the dog and says sternly

ELEANOR
Quiet

The dog stops barking and sits Eleanor looks up to Zissou
Ned and Jane on the look-out tower She shouts

ELEANOR
Somebody pay for this water taxi

Pause Zissou says to Ned

ZISSOU
You got any petty cash on you

INT CARGO HOLD NIGHT

The entire crew sits around Zissou and Eleanor at a folding
table with Eleanor’s steel briefcase open in front of them
It is filled with neatly stacked 100 dollar bills Eleanor

has a telephone receiver to her ear listening Ned stands

alone in the corner

ZISSOU
Klaus remind me to send Eleanor’s
parents a thank-you note on the good
correspondence stock

Klaus nods Eleanor addresses the group

ELEANOR
This is the message we received earlier
tonight on our answering machine at
Pescespada Island

Eleanor places the receiver on a cradle connected to a
speakerphone Bill’s voice comes over the line There are
jungle sounds and static on it

BILL (V0O)
Bill Ubell here Im on a pay-phone

INSERT

The answering machine at Pescespada Island There is a
photograph of the original Team Zissou with Zissou and
Esteban front and center on the wall behind it

BILL (VO)

Im still blindfolded and my arms are
bound but a young boy has been kind
enough to assist me Theres not much
chance Ill get another opportunity to
call so I thought Id ask if --

(suddenly)
No no I’m just talking to my wife Our
daughter’s graduating from high school
and --

Bill switches into rapid Indonesian and the line goes dead

CUT TO

The cargo hold Eleanor hangs up the speakerphone

ZISSOU
Well thanks for checking in Bill Maybe
next time you could let us know where
youre at

ELEANOR
Based on the quality of the connection
the variety of the wildlife in the
background and the elapsed time between
Mr Ubell’s capture and this message --
there’s a good chance he’s on one of the
Ping Islands

Eleanor unfolds a map of the area onto the table She
indicates a circle with her finger around a cluster of tiny
islands

ELEANOR
There was once a four-star hotel on
Little Ping but the entire island was
destroyed by monsoon five years ago It’s
been uninhabited ever since

Zissou sighs He shakes his head

ZISSOU
I know the place Hotel Citroandén Cubbie
I want to go on the record
(with admiration)
Eleanor’s always been the brains behind
Team Zissou By the way are you going to

ZISSOU (cont d)

put in a good description of the command
center I set up down here

Jane ignores this question Zissou turns to the rest of the
crew

ZISSOU
Well are we clear gang Set a course
for Little Ping Island full-speed ahead

NED
(coldly)
Youll need to hire a team of mechanics
and re-build the engine first of course

ZISSOU
(hesitates)
I know I’m saying after that

Ned walks out of the room Zissou and Eleanor stand aside as
the meeting breaks up

ELEANOR
Just because I’ve decided to save your
neck again and help you do this rescue
doesn’t mean you’ve won me back

ZISSOU
(quietly)
OK

Wolodarsky sits at the radar monitor across the room A blip
glows near the center of the screen

INT GALLEY NIGHT

Eleanor cooks grilled cheese sandwiches with sardines on the
stove Jane sits at the kitchen table drinking a glass of
milk They both wear bathrobes Ned stands on deck outside
the window smoking his pipe looking out across the harbor

Eleanor sees Jane watching Ned affectionately Pause She
points to him with a spatula

ELEANOR
I think Ned’s the politest person I’ve
met in my life

Jane nods and smiles sadly Eleanor brings over the
sandwiches and sits down next to her

JANE
Thanks

Eleanor nods She points at Jane’s stomach

ELEANOR
Is the father out of the picture

JANE

Uh-huh I was actually kind of terrified
to have this baby --

(realizing)
-- but right now I’m not really scared of
anything

(pause)
Maybe it’s my hormones

ELEANOR
That makes sense

JANE
What’s going to happen to you and Steve

ELEANOR
(shrugs)
Nobody knows

Eleanor goes to the refrigerator and gets a pitcher of milk
She refills Jane’s glass She sits back down and stares at
Jane for a minute She says finally

ELEANOR
I’m going to tell you something confiden-
tially which won’t be mentioned again
I’m pretty sure I’m the only person that
can say this including Steve Never mind
how I found out -- I’m a scientist It’s
the thing that puzzles me about Ned’s
situation

JANE
What is it

ELEANOR
Zissou shoots blanks

JANE
(hesitates)
Uh-huh

ELEANOR
(pause)
I think maybe it’s because he’s spent
half his life underwater

Jane nods thoughtfully She looks to Ned outside
CUT TO

Ned staring into the distance Jane and Eleanor watch him
through the kitchen porthole in the background Ned
extinguishes his pipe and shakes out the ashes Little sparks
float around him He slips the pipe into his pocket and goes
inside

piece of brooding suspenseful electronic music begins Renzo
rolls the film

INSERT
The screen of the flat-bed

The first image is of Ogata alert in the observation bubble

EXT OCEAN DAY

The Belafonte slowly approaches the smoldering wreckage of
Hennessey’s research vessel half-sunken in the bay It looks
deserted The crew of the Belafonte watches frightened and
disturbed Zissou smiles slightly

ZISSOU (V0O)
Our colleague Alistair Hennessey and his
crew are nowhere to be found

EXT RESEARCH VESSEL DAY

Wolodarsky turning a knob on the tape recorder The music
fades out Renzo stops the film Zissou nods He looks to
Wolodarsky and says in a determined voice

ZISSOU
Not bad We’ll temp it with that anyway

Wolodarsky looks pleased
EXT BEACH DAY

Dawn A forgotten beach with demolished cabanas and tattered
umbrellas stuck in the sand A torn poster with an image of

the resort as it once was hangs rustling on a crooked board
The sea is calm at low tide The three-legged dog paddles in
from the surf and walks onto the beach It shakes the water

off itself

The head of a diver in a mask and a Team Zissou wet suit pops
up out of the ocean inside the breakers Seven other divers
emerge one by one and advance on the shore

The first diver to reach land takes off his mask He is
Zissou He scans the tree-line with a spear-gun at the ready
He lets out a wild yelp Ned Klaus Ogata Renzo Pelé and
Wolodarsky take off their masks and aqualungs They check
their Glocks Pelé helps Wolodarsky inspect a bundle of
dynamite Vikram films the scene

Zissou sees the dog digging in the sand He whistles

ZISSOU
Cody

The dog goes over to Zissou Zissou and his team run into the
jungle

EXT MARSH DAY

Zissou leads his team through a rice paddy and emerges from
the mud among a herd of grazing water buffaloes He looks at
his ankle and frowns He pulls off a leech

ZISSOU
Oh shit Swamp leeches Everybody Check
for swamp leeches and pull them off of
you

Zissou pulls leeches off his arms hands feet and neck The
others check but no one else has been bitten Zissou begins
to notice this

ZISSOU
Nobody else got hit What’s the deal Im
the only one

The others shrug and shake their heads Zissou seems annoyed
Wolodarsky pulls a leech from behind Zissou’s ear He
examines it closely and touches it with his tongue He puts
it into a tiny Zip-loc specimen bag Zissou looks at him
like he is insane Wolodarsky explains

WOLODARSKY
These have curative properties

ZISSOU
(hesitates)
Well yeah I know but they probably
taste like shit

Zissou whistles and they continue through the jungle
CUT TO

The seven divers and the dog hidden in the bushes on the edge
of a clearing with their Glocks out and ready A five-story
cement hotel that looks like a bunker stands across from
them It is overgrown with vines and trees and most of its
windows have been smashed out There is an empty Olympic-
sized swimming pool with dirty water and algae at the bottom
Small monkeys run and swing on branches in the courtyard A
destroyed golf cart lies on its side partially buried with
a red and white striped snake winding around its steering
wheel A sign above the front entrance says Hotel Citroén

Zissou shakes his head He says sadly

ZISSOU
What a shame They had a bartender here
Kino made the best rum cannonball I ever
tasted

Zissou sighs He turns to Vikram

ZISSOU
You ready Vikram

Vikram holds up his light meter and takes a reading He nods
Zissou looks to everyone else and shrugs

ZISSOU
Should we do this

No one responds Zissou runs out into the clearing His group
follows him in single-file around the side of the hotel They
cut across a deserted tennis court with a fallen net and
plants growing out of it They quickly climb a chain-link
fence and drop down into a desolate rose garden They go
inside through the service entrance

INT HOTEL DAY

Zissou and his team run through the kitchen down a back
corridor and up the fire stairs anxiously checking every
closet and corner They hand-signal to each other elaborately
and continuously

EXT HOTEL DAY

Zissou and his team come out onto the roof Zissou cocks his
head to one side abruptly He licks his pinky and holds it up
in the air He nods

ZISSOU
The barometer’s falling It’s going to
rain in five minutes We got to be quick

OGATA
Well where are they

ZISSOU
Unknown Split into two groups Ill take
Ned Ogata and Wolodarsky

KLAUS
(hurt)
Thanks Thanks a lot for not picking me

Klaus walks away to the edge of the roof shaking his head
with his back to the group Zissou sighs He goes over to
Klaus and stands behind him

ZISSOU
We’re smack in the middle of a lightning
strike rescue op Klaus Whats the deal

Klaus shrugs and says without looking back to Zissou

KLAUS
I’m sick of being on B-squad

ZISSOU
(surprised)
Listen you may be on B-squad but you’re
the B-squad leader

Zissou punches Klaus gently in the back Klaus turns around
There are tears in his eyes Zissou continues

ZISSOU
Don’t you know me and Esteban always
thought of you as our baby brother

Klaus nods He shakes his head He says choked up

KLAUS
I always thought of you two as my dads
Please don’t let anyone make fun of me
for saying so

Zissou hesitates He hugs Klaus

ZISSOU
I can’t guarantee that Klausie but I’11
try Can we get on with the maneuvers
now

There is a flash of lightning then a thunderclap Everyone
looks up at the sky

CUT TO

Zissou Ned Ogata and Wolodarsky running silently down a
corridor They open each hotel room and look inside with
their guns drawn Zissou shouts

ZISSOU

WOLODARSKY

CUT TO

Klaus Pelé Renzo and Vikram racing across a balcony along
the front of the building They peer into the windows Klaus
yells

KLAUS

Zissou and his group convene with Klaus and the others at the
top of the main staircase above the lobby

ZISSOU
Klaus Pirates

KLAUS

deserted

ZISSOU

Shit We played a bum hunch Fuck OK
let’s not get down on ourselves Theres
still two more Ping Islands to check out
except I don’t know if we got enough gas
to get there Dammit Steve

(depressed)
This sucks I’m disappointed in myself

Zissou sighs He surveys the lobby below It is filled with
trash overturned furniture and a huge chandelier which has
crashed onto the floor The entire room appears to have been
underwater at some point and there are shells and seaweed
everywhere The concierge desk remains intact It has started
to rain outside Zissou says quietly

ZISSOU
My first wife Jacqueline and I spent
our honeymoon here
(pause)
Things are pretty different now

Zissou turns to Ned beside him Ned looks to Zissou
uncertainly Zissou takes a deep breath He motions down the
stairs and says loudly to the rest of the group

ZISSOU
All right Let’s check out

Zissou starts down the staircase He immediately slips on the
slick marble and tumbles hard bouncing and rolling all the
way down to the lobby He lies on his back sprawled out on
the wet paisley carpet

Everyone races down after Zissou They circle around him
Vikram is filming Zissou says calmly

ZISSOU
Did you get that Vikram
VIKRAM
(hesitates)
Uh -- yeah
ZISSOU
Good We’ll give them the reality this

time

(utterly defeated)
A washed up old man with no friends no
distribution deal wife on the rocks
people laughing at him feeling sorry for
himself Up until now we had a
documentary about me being a shitty
person --

(almost pleased
-- but now it’s actually sad Can I have
a word alone with my son please

Everyone moves away leaving Ned kneeling over Zissou

NED
Are you all right

ZISSOU
Not really By the way thanks for saving
my life when that trunk was about to fall
off the luggage rack and cold-cock me

NED
(pause)
It probably wouldn’t’ve killed you

ZISSOU
Well it would’ve left a hell of a knot
Ive been trying to think of a nick-name
that might mean the right thing I came
up with Papa-Steve

Ned hesitates He nods sadly He helps Zissou to his feet

ZISSOU
I’m sorry I never acknowledged your
existence all those years It won’t
happen again I mean it

Zissou puts his hand around the back of Ned’s neck

ZISSOU
You are my son to me Almost more so
See for me to meet a guy like you at
this time in my life it’s just --

Zissou starts to say something more but stops He looks down
at the floor and shrugs

ZISSOU
I don’t know I want to communicate my
feelings to you but I think I might
start to cry

NED
(gently)
That’s OK

Klaus rings the bell at the reception desk on the other side
of the lobby Zissou and Ned look at him He points to an
open closet and says in a loud stage-whisper

KLAUS
Something’s in the coat-check

INT COAT-CHECK DAY

A few faded wind-breakers and topcoats hang from a rod
Zissou tries a knob on a door at the back of the room It is
locked He knocks lightly and ducks away around the corner
with his gun poised There is a quiet tapping and squeaking
from behind the door

Zissou motions to Ogata Ogata hands him a crowbar Zissou
cracks open the door and looks inside

INT LAUNDRY ROOM DAY

There are rows of rusted and dilapidated washing machines and
electric dryers along the walls Bill sits with Hennessey’s
Japanese television crew on folding metal chairs They are
tied up and blindfolded with duct tape over their mouths
They look starved and half-conscious and have been beaten
severely

Zissou runs over to Bill He says hopefully

ZISSOU
Billy You OK

Zissou undoes Bill’s blindfold and carefully pulls the tape
off his mouth Bill says immediately in a parched cracking
voice

BILL
Did you get my message

ZISSOU
Yeah It was kind of garbled

Ned and Klaus untie the Japanese television crew who look
disoriented and terrified Zissou says to Bill

ZISSOU
Where is everybody When was the last
time you heard from these screwballs

BILL
(pause)
Honestly You lose track of time

CUT TO

Zissou and his group supporting Bill and the Japanese
television crew as they exit the building Zissou stands at
the revolving door pushing it as each person goes through
He follows them out He stops suddenly

There are ten fresh graves lined up in a row next to the
front door An Operation Hennessey hat hangs from a make-
shift cross on each mound of dirt Everyone waits in silence
They look shocked Klaus says nervously

KLAUS
Jesus These pirates are monsters

ZISSOU
(hesitates)
Well yeah but remember I shot one of
their guys in the neck last week and
killed him so I think we’re OK too
(suddenly)
Wheres Cody

INT HOTEL DAY
Zissou comes back inside through the revolving door He sees

the three-legged dog across the lobby near the bottom of the
stairs staring transfixed at a door growling

Zissou frowns He yells

ZISSOU
Cody

The dog does not respond Pause Zissou walks slowly toward
him Ned watches from outside through a glass door Zissou
stands over the dog He opens the door

Fifteen Indonesian men sit at a table smoking cigarettes and
playing cards in an abandoned ballroom There are dollars
euros rupees and yen crumpled and tossed in front of them
Three other men cook turtle soup and rice over cans of
Sterno Another twenty-five or thirty men stand around with
shot-glasses in their hands There are rifles pistols and
machetes strewn across the tables and floor There are cans
of fuel and crates of stolen food and clothing stacked along
the walls There are piles of watches television sets
pornographic videotapes jewelry and bottles of liquor

The pirates are all staring at Zissou Hennessey sits among
them holding a hand of cards in front of him His hair has
been shorn off and there are cuts and scratches all over his
scalp and face He has lost several teeth He hesitates

HENNESSEY
Steven are you rescuing me

Pause Zissou nods reluctantly Hennessey looks deeply
touched He drops his cards on the table and says to the
pirates

HENNESSEY
Fold
(to Zissou)
What’s our next move

Zissou hesitates A pirate across the table shoots Hennessey
Hennessey is knocked down flat on the floor Zissou grimaces
in horror He ducks behind the staircase and struggles to get
his Glock out of its holster The rest of the pirates
scramble grabbing weapons and shooting Zissou shoots back

EXT HOTEL DAY

The rain is coming down hard Ned stands outside watching
through the glass door as the gunfire starts inside His eyes
widen He turns to Klaus and yells

NED
Klaus bring the dynamite

Klaus grabs the bundle of dynamite from Pelé He and Ned run
into the lobby through the revolving door The dog darts out
while it is still spinning

Bill Ogata Renzo Pelé Wolodarsky and the Japanese
television crew stand frozen at the edge of the empty
swimming pool The shooting inside bursts into a frenzy
Ogata and Pelé exchange a look They draw their Glocks There
is a large explosion inside the hotel

Pause Zissou Ned and Klaus run out dragging Hennessey
who limps and hops They are all completely covered in black
soot and Klaus is on fire Hennessey is bloody Smoke pours
from the lobby through the revolving door Klaus rapidly
peels off the top of his burning wet suit His skin is clean
and white beneath it He stamps out the flames Zissou
shouts

ZISSOU
They’re in there after all Run Go
Move Now

Zissou and his group sprint panicking back into the jungle
EXT JUNGLE DAY

Zissou leads everyone across a narrow footbridge over a
gorge He says to Hennessey as they run

ZISSOU
Vikram got some great footage of your
boat out there I guess it’s totalled
huh

HENNESSEY
Perhaps but were extremely well-
insured I’1ll probably come out ahead in
the end -- although well obviously have
to crew-up from scratch next time
(quietly)

They made soup out of my research
turtles

Zissou sees a half-destroyed poster for the Ping Invitational
pasted-up at the end of the bridge next to a sign pointing to
the ninth hole He shakes his head

ZISSOU
The ninth was a long four but you had to
hook it short before the bluff or youd
end up skipping out into that rice paddy

A bullet zings past Zissou He looks back The pirates emerge
shooting from the other side of the gorge Pelé takes a
bullet in the shoulder but keeps running Zissou and his
group duck behind an embankment They exchange a volley of
gunfire with the pirates Zissou yells

ZISSOU
Ogata do some first aid on Pelé
Klausie Ned-o Dig in and hold these
rustlers off while I call in the rendez-
vous We’ll meet on the beach

Zissou signals for the others to run He starts to go himself
but hesitates He points to Ned and Klaus

ZISSOU
You’re A-squad

Klaus gives Zissou an annoyed look He and Ned continue the
gunfight as Zissou takes off

EXT BEACH DAY

The skinny thirteen-year-old Indonesian boy sits alone
cooking a sea-crab on a spit over a campfire in the sand He
hears gunfire from the jungle and looks up quickly He
frowns He picks up a machete

Zissou races out of the trees He shouts into a walkie-
talkie

ZISSOU
Renzo Renzo Renzo Anybody Hello
Hello

Zissou frowns at the walkie-talkie He shouts to Wolodarsky
behind him

Z2ISSOU
This gizmo’s out of juice

Wolodarsky grabs the walkie-talkie out of Zissou’s hands and
looks at it He smashes it onto the ground Zissou sees the
boy on the beach He points his spear-gun at him The boy
stands up slowly as a look of panic comes over his face

Bill puts his hand in front of Zissou’s spear-gun and says
with emotion

BILL
That’s Cédric He’s a friend
Bill waves to the boy The boy waves back with his machete
Zissou says wistfully

ZISSOU
Merci Cédric
(to Bill)
Remind me well send him a red cap and
Speedo

EXT MARINA DAY

Zissou runs onto a deserted pier followed by the rest of his
group There is a large fishing boat moored near the shore
The pirates’ speedboat sits tied at the end of the dock
Zissou yells to Pelé

ZISSOU
Grab the keys out of that fishing boat
and throw them in the water No wait
They might have a spare set Just blow it
up

Pelé nods He has a tourniquet on his arm He climbs onto the
fishing boat and runs inside Zissou directs everyone else to
board the speedboat He gets in after them Bill freezes He

stares at something on deck at the prow Zissou goes over to

him and looks

The yellow safe from the Belafonte sits in front of them

Ogata starts the speedboat’s motor Pelé runs from the
fishing boat down the dock and jumps into the speedboat
The sounds of yelling and shooting grow louder from the
jungle Wolodarsky administers to Hennessey’s and Pelé’s
bullet wounds Zissou looks to the beach

Ned and Klaus sprint out of the jungle firing back over
their shoulders Zissou opens fire at the trees to cover
them Ned and Klaus throw themselves onto the speedboat
Klaus guns it and they pull away from the dock Zissou says
to Ned

ZISSOU
Well it looks like we recovered your
inheritance

Zissou motions to the safe Ned nods breathing heavily
Zissou kneels down and spins the dial left and right He
opens the safe There is large hole blown in the back and
the ocean is beyond it The safe is empty Ned’s face appears
in the hole He looks at Zissou through the safe

ZISSOU
All right That’s it I’m retired

Ned frowns He shakes his head He motions for Zissou to come
toward him Zissou leans into the safe Ned whispers in the
darkness -- with a strange metallic echo magnifying his
voice

NED
This might not be the right time or place
to discuss this Papa-Steve but weve
still got a shark to wrestle and --

ZISSOU
(curiously)
The acoustics are unbelievable in here
Testing Testing

Ned hesitates The fishing boat explodes near the shore
behind them Zissou pulls himself out of the safe and runs to
the back of the speedboat He makes a congratulatory gesture
to Pelé Pelé shrugs sheepishly Zissou suddenly spots the
three-legged dog stands alone at the end of the pier wagging
its tail watching them

ZISSOU
Oh no We got to go back and get --

Zissou turns around to his passengers They all look at him --
blackened bloody and shell-shocked Zissou sighs He turns
away again to look at the dog as it recedes behind them He
waves to it and says quietly

ZISSOU
Good-bye Cody

The pirates begin to appear on the beach in the distance one
by one as the speedboat races away from the marina A Zodiak
motorboat pulls up alongside them Eleanor is at the wheel
with the curly-black-haired intern beside her She waves to
Zissou enthusiastically Zissou shrugs Ogata throws a rubber
ring at one of the dolphin scouts swimming with the Zodiak
The dolphin catches the ring on its nose The sound of a
helicopter fades-in under the scene

INT HELICOPTER DAY

Ned flies Zissou’s chopper low over the ocean He wears a
Team Zissou flight-suit Zissou sits in the seat beside him
looking out with his boy scout binoculars They speak in
voice-over
NED (V0O)

here’s Pescespada Island and this circle
represents friendship and the K here
stands for Klaus

CUT TO

Zissou Ned and Klaus standing on the deck of the Belafonte
looking down at something in front of them Zissou looks
depressed Ned has a needle and thread in one hand and a pair
of scissors in the other The sound of the chopper continues
under the scene

Klaus turns to Ned suddenly He seems moved

KLAUS
Where’s your symbol Ned

NED
(hesitates)
Oh I didn’t want to impose myself

ZISSOU
(sadly)
Klaus is right The flag needs a Ned
symbol
NED
(pleased)

Well I suppose I could put an N on the
side of this octopus

of the chopper continues under the scene

WOLODARSKY
It was working OK until late last night
but now the whole tracking system’s gone
completely on the fritz

ZISSOU
Screw it We’1l sell it for scrap along
with the boat and the submarines I’m
going home

CUT TO

Ned pulling Zissou aside in the stairwell The sound of the
chopper continues under the scene Ned says firmly

NED
Let’s take up the chopper and see what we
find out there anyway I’ve got a
feeling we can spot this fish froma
hundred and eleven feet up

ZISSOU
(defeated)
Ned I don’t know if I ever even saw this
bastard
NED

(raising his voice)
I have 275000 invested in this damn
production Something ate Esteban didn’t

hopefully

NED

A letter from Jane

ZISSOU
(hesitates)
What does she say

NED
(wistfully)
Nothing to speak of

Ned waves to Jane standing in the wind on the look-out tower
Hennessey and Bill are beside her Hennessey is shirtless
with a large bandage over his mid-section Jane smiles down
at Ned and waves back to him

CUT TO

Zissou and Ned flying in the helicopter Ned and Klaus shout

Of course Klaus It was my pleasure

CUT TO

Ned sitting in the chopper with the motor running Zissou is
beside him Klaus stands crouched over outside Ned’s door He
holds Ned’s arm and yells earnestly over the sound of the
engine

KLAUS
Yeah but you stitched me onto the
dolphin and I want you to know how much
it means to me

NED
Well I’m very pleased you liked it
KLAUS
(sharply)
You’re not listening to me I didn’t just

like it
Klaus hesitates He salutes Ned formally Pause

KLAUS
Do you understand

CUT TO

Zissou and Ned flying in the helicopter Ned shouts
gratefully in voice-over

NED (VO)
Yes I do Thank you Klaus

Zissou reaches into his pocket and takes out an old beaten
up envelope He yells to Ned

ZISSOU
Ive still got yours of course

NED
(confused)
My what

Zissou takes a letter out of the envelope He unfolds it and
hands it to Ned

INSERT

A worn and faded typewritten note on graph paper A young boy
reads it in voice-over

Dear Captain Zissou

Iam 12 years old and live in Jawbone Kentucky A creek
runs behind our house where I live with my mother (she met
you once some years ago) and I collect and catalogue

amphibians reptiles and insects I don’t know what this
one is called so I named it myself

There is a drawing in pencil of a gnat labelled Kentucky
Zissou Fly

cuT TO

You are probably my one of if not the favorite person I
have ever studied I plan to be either

a) an oceanographer

b) an architect

c) a pilot

Thank you very much for your good work

Sincerely
Ned Plimpton

Blue Star Cadet Zissou Society

PS Do you ever wish you could breathe underwater

Ned with tears in his eyes He says to Zissou

NED
I still wish I could breathe underwater

ZISSOU
(sadly)
Me too Ned

Something catches Zissou’s attention in the water below He
looks down the side of the chopper through his binoculars A
school of gently glowing pink fish swims rapidly in the
shallows Zissou turns to Ned and says excitedly

ZISSOU
Fluorescent snapper

NED
(hesitates)
What’s that

ZISSOU
A good sign Last time we saw this big
shit-kicker he was --

The helicopter hits an air pocket and bounces once hard
There is a loud thump and a whoosh followed by a metallic
ping from above Ned turns quickly to Zissou concerned
Zissou looks uneasy He points toward the ceiling

ZISSOU
Something popped up there didn’t it

Ned nods and checks his instruments

NED
I heard a pin snap loose in the --

There is a sudden deafening groan overhead The sound of the
rotor blades slows and then cracks The chopper drops like a
stone Zissou and Ned brace themselves Ned pulls on the
controls The helicopter rattles and rumbles vigorously A
chunk of twisted steel rips into the roof tearing open the
cockpit Glass shatters and parts of the helicopter break
away

Ned turns to Zissou and smiles uncertainly Zissou hesitates
Ned shrugs and smiles more broadly Zissou reaches out to Ned
and puts his arm across Ned’s chest bracing him He says
blankly

ZISSOU
This is going to hurt

EXT UNDERWATER DAY
Bubbles rocket past them as they sink
CUT TO

The ocean Zissou surfaces among the wreckage and burning
debris of the destroyed helicopter There is blood all over
him He sees Ned right away draped calmly over a flotation
cushion His helmet is still on and his face is white
Zissou yells to him

ZISSOU
Ned

Ned nods to Zissou and says evenly

NED
Hey Steevesy

Zissou swims over to Ned and pulls his helmet off

ZISSOU
Are you OK

NED
I think so

Ned slides off the flotation cushion and starts to slip
beneath the surface Zissou puts his arms around Ned’s body
and holds him above the water

ZISSOU
What happened We hit something

NED
Most likely not I think maybe the push-
rod failed

ZISSOU
Im sorry Ned I should’ve scrapped this
chopper ten years ago

NED

(getting an idea)
You know maybe I should’ve auto-rotated
and performed a high-bank through our
descent We might’ve crashed a little
softer

(pause)
Probably wouldn’t’ve made any difference
though

Ned closes his eyes and his body goes limp Zissou puts his
finger to Ned’s neck to check for a pulse He looks around in
a panic

EXT BEACH DAY

Zissou carries Ned out of the surf and sets him down in the
sand Smoke rises from the crash site beyond the breaking
waves Zissou sits on his knees next to the body He takes
Ned’s hand and holds it

EXT OCEAN DAY

Dusk The Belafonte sits at anchor with two sea-planes docked
alongside it White Christmas lights are strung along the
ship’s railings and around the edges of its windows

EXT MAIN DECK DAY

Zissou and his crew stand with Jane Drakoulias Phillip
Hennessey Bill the Japanese television crew and two middle-
aged men in Air Kentucky pilot uniforms around a casket
wrapped in a Team Zissou flag Zissou has cuts bruises and
bandages all over his face and body

Klaus reads from a bundle of little scraps of paper Everyone
listens with tears all over their faces -- except Zissou who
stares straight ahead with a hollow look in his eyes

Klaus finishes Jane steps forward with a stack of letters in
her hand She tucks them into the casket She presses the lid

shut and takes a slow deep breath She closes her fist
around the glittering sand-dollar hanging from her neck

CUT TO

Zissou Klaus Ogata Pelé and the two Air Kentucky pilots
sliding the casket off the side of the deck It drops length-
wise into the surf

INT OBSERVATION BUBBLE DAY

Eleanor watches sadly through the portholes underwater as the
casket sinks past her She smokes a cigarette

INT SALON NIGHT

A small reception after the funeral Pelé is in the corner
playing a quiet David Bowie song on his guitar Eleanor sits
in a red vinyl armchair next to Drakoulias She has a box of
Kleenex in her lap She touches one to her eyes and tilts her
head back to keep the tears from running down her face

Zissou Klaus and Ogata stand together drinking glasses of
whiskey

ZISSOU
This is the first time Eleanor’s ever
cried in front of me as long as I’ve
known her -- except once when she got her
arm caught in the deck-winch Broke it in
two places

Hennessey fills two cups of coffee at an espresso machine on
the counter A label on the base of the machine says
Operation Hennessey Hennessey turns abruptly to Bill

HENNESSEY
Is this my espresso machine Howd you
get my espresso machine

BILL
(pause)
Ah we fucking stole it man

Hennessey frowns He brings a cup of coffee over to Eleanor
Zissou sits down next to them and says to Hennessey

ZISSOU
Allie why don’t you go powder your nose
I want to talk to your ex-wife

Hennessey nods He holds Zissou by the arm and Says
confidentially
HENNESSEY
Weve never made great husbands have we
Of course I have a good excuse Im part-
gay

Zissou shrugs He smiles and says warmly

ZISSOU
Supposedly everyone is

Hennessey hugs Zissou and walks away Zissou turns to

Eleanor

ZISSOU
I never told you this but I was hoping
we were going to get the chance to adopt
Ned I think he would’ve wanted it that
way Would you have gone along with me on
that one

ELEANOR
He was thirty Steve -- but I would’ve
considered it

ZISSOU
(moved)
Thanks Eleanor

Zissou goes over to Drakoulias They stand together in front
of the window The moon is up but it is still light outside

DRAKOULIAS
Were a dying breed

ZISSOU
Yeah I guess we were all right while we
lasted though weren’t we

DRAKOULIAS
Oh we were like glory’s gate my
darling We were like that bloody shark
of yours We swam with the -- goddammit
I had it on the plane What was I going
to say Oh well It’s good to see you

ZISSOU
Hows your passport status

DRAKOULIAS
Much better thank you I’m back down to
X-4
Drakoulias motions to Jane sitting alone on a red vinyl sofa
across the room She looks devastated Mascara runs down her
cheeks

DRAKOULIAS
Who knocked-up the reporter

ZISSOU
(pause)
I dont know

Zissou picks up a chocolate-covered strawberry and a napkin
off a tray He walks over to Jane and sits down beside her
He hands her the strawberry She takes a bite

ZISSOU
By the way thanks for showing me your
first draft

JANE
You read it What’d you think

ZISSOU

Well at first I was embarrassed
Obviously people are going to think I’m
a showboat and a little bit of a prick --
but then I realized that’s me I said
those things I did those things

(shrugs)
I can live with that

Jane smiles desolately She takes the napkin and rubs off
some of her smeared mascara Zissou says simply

ZISSOU
You’re a good writer Jane

JANE
It’s the f-ing cover

ZISSOU
(wistfully)
That a girl

Wolodarsky opens the door and says

WOLODARSKY
Excuse me I’m sorry to interrupt but we
just got the scanning monitor back up
and the jaguar shark or whatever it is
were tracking looks like it’s ina
trench on the far side of the reef

Silence Zissou looks to the rest of the party and shrugs He
says sadly

ZISSOU
Anybody feel like going for a ride

INT MINIATURE SUBMARINE NIGHT

Zissou Eleanor Jane Klaus Drakoulias Bill Wolodarsky
Ogata Pelé Vikram Renzo Hennessey and the remaining
intern with the broken arm are all squeezed into Zissous
submersible Deep Search formerly Jacqueline Flowing water
casts shadows in patterns on their faces Zissou is at the
wheel A depth-sounding ping echoes periodically

There is a large dead tuna with clusters of sparkling chips
among its scales trailing at the end of a line behind them
Zissou points it out to Jane

ZISSOU
I hooked a rhinestone bluefin on a rope
to give him something to eat

Jane nods
INSERT

The dashboard control panel A warning sticker below the fuel
gauge reads No more than six passengers permitted at any
time Zissou presses a button and a piece of dreamy
electronic music begins to play

CUT TO

Zissou steering the vessel into a pitch-black trench He
flips a switch and turns on the lights outside the submarine
They descend through schools of luminous fish past giant
crabs sea-turtles electric eels and octopuses which dart
out from their caves to see them Tiny glowing translucent
creatures circle around them as they dive deeper and deeper

They arrive at the bottom of the trench Black water smokes
from stacks among the rocks below and strange flowers and
vines float and shiver on the ocean’s floor An undersea
river with a mist over it winds through a shallow canyon The
submarine hovers

Zissou compares the numbers on the instrument panel with a
list in a notebook Wolodarsky types something into a
calculator and turns to Zissou He shrugs Zissou nods He
dims the lights They look out into the darkness

A school of gently glowing pink fish suddenly swarms around
the vessel swirling in all directions and disappears
Zissou breathes heavily Everyone waits in silence

A gigantic shark seventy feet long emerges slowly from the
darkness It looks scratched and scarred and pre-historic
Its skin is covered with black and gold rings and circles
and it shimmers with a silver lustre A small homing device
on the end of a dart blinks brightly on it’s back It swims
quietly toward them Zissou swallows Everyone watches
hypnotized Vikram films it Klaus says oddly

KLAUS
Is that him

Hennessey answers quietly with emotion

HENNESSEY
That’s him Klaus

The shark sweeps gently past the tiny submarine and bumps it
lightly snapping away the tuna The submarine dips violently
and tips over The passengers are thrown sideways They look
at each other terrified Zissou rights the submarine and
steers away from the rocks Jane whispers

JANE
Are we safe in here

Zissou turns to Jane and smiles

ZISSOU
I doubt it

The shark circles back around them Klaus looks concerned

KLAUS
Do we still want to blow it up

ZISSOU
(pause)
Nah Were out of dynamite anyway

Eleanor looks to Zissou She smiles She says warmly (in
spite of everything)

ELEANOR
It is beautiful Steve

ZISSOU
Yeah it’s pretty good isn’t it

Eleanor nods Silence Zissou says softly

ZISSOU
I wonder if he remembers me

Pause Tears suddenly stream down Zissou’s cheeks His body
clenches up and his arms coil around his shoulders He
covers his face and starts crying Eleanor puts her hand on
the top of Zissou’s head Jane puts her hand on Zissou’s
knee Klaus holds Zissou’s shoulder Drakoulias takes
Zissou’s hand Ogata takes the other Pelé Bill and the
broken-armed intern touch Zissou’s back Hennessey places his
hand on the back of Zissou’s neck

Zissou reaches out to Jane and puts his hand on her stomach
Jane smiles sadly

JANE
In twelve years hell be eleven and a
half

Zissou looks surprised and touched He says with his voice
cracking

ZISSOU
That was my favorite age

INT AUDITORIUM NIGHT

The screen at the Loquasto Film Festival The scene in progress
shows the jaguar shark as it swims away into the darkness

CUT TO

Zissou Ned and Jane on the deck of the Belafonte leaning
against the railing looking out at the sunset Ned points to
the horizon imitating Zissou’s pose from the official
publicity still He says to Zissou

NED
Like this

Zissou nods He answers wistfully

ZISSOU
Just like that

Ned takes Jane’s hand Jane turns to Zissou

JANE
You do it too

Zissou smiles He points to the horizon The image freezes
and he says in voice-over

ZISSOU (V0)
We complete the adventure but another
member of our crew has been lost

CUT TO

A close-up of the back of Ned’s head with the new flag flying
on a pole beyond him He has his pipe in his mouth and the
wind blows the smoke

A dedication appears at the bottom of the screen

CUT TO

The audience at the screening watching intently There is an
empty seat in-between Eleanor and Drakoulias

ZISSOU (VO)
We start the voyage home in our wounded
vessel

Jane sits in the front row of the highest tier of the
balconies chewing gum and watching the screen She wears a
sad remote look on her face She holds her baby wrapped in a
blanket with a miniature knitted red cap on its head

EXT THEATRE NIGHT

Zissou sits alone on the steps outside the auditorium A red
carpet runs down to the street in front of him There are a

few guards with machine-guns at the entrance to the theatre
and a quiet crowd waits behind a barricade

Zissou wears his red pin in the lapel of his tuxedo and his

gold legion of honor medal around his neck There is a gold-
plated award statuette of a barracuda on the pavement beside
him He smokes a joint

The sound of applause is heard from inside

Klaus’ nephew Werner comes out and sits next to Zissou
Zissou looks at him Pause Zissou reaches into his pocket
and takes out Ned’s Team Zissou ring He gives it to Werner
Werner examines it and puts it onto his finger

Zissou makes a little flick of the wrist and says quietly

ZISSOU
Ho

Werner looks up at Zissou He nods

WERNER
Ho

Strings of lights flicker over Zissou and Werner’s heads
Zissou says wearily with hope and regret

ZISSOU
This is an adventure

Three sets of double-doors open at once and the audience
bursts out from the lobby The waiting crowd pushes through
the barricade Fans and paparazzi surround Zissou and Werner
Zissou grabs his award statuette He picks up Werner with one
hand and sets him onto his shoulders He walks sadly down the
red carpet with Werner floating above the rushing mob
Flashbulbs go off all around them They disappear into the
congregation as it flows down the street to the marina

The Belafonte waits moored in the bay
