THE MAN WHO WASNT THERE
BY

Ethan Coen and Joel Coen

Black

ED (VO)
Yeah I worked in a barbershop But
I never considered myself a barber

We track back from a barbers pole

ED (VO)
-I stumbled into it--well married
into it more precisely

We track back from a shopkeepers bell triggered by an opening
door The pull back and tilt down show the top of the head
of a customer entering in slow motion

ED (VO)
--I wasnt my establishment Like
the fella says I only work here

We track along a shelf backed by a mirror and holding pomade
aftershave hair tonic a whisk brush

ED (VO)
--The dump was 200 feet square
with five chairs or stations as we
call ‘em even though there were
only two of us working

We track in on a big man in a barbers smock scissoring across
a lock of hair that he pulls taut between two fingers of one
hand In slow motion he laughs and chats

ED (VO)
-Frank Raffo my brother-in-law
was the principal barber And man
could he talk

Another man in a barbers smock is running electric clippers
across a childs head A cigarette between his lips

ED (VO)
He plucks
a tray

--Now maybe if youre eleven or
twelve years old Franks got an
interesting point of view but
sometimes it got on my nerves Not
that Id complain mind you Like I
said he was the principal barber
Franks father August--they called
him Guzzi--had worked the heads up

in Santa Rosa for thirty-five years
until his ticker stopped in the middle
of a Junior Flat Top He left the
shop to Frankie free and clear And
that seemed to satisfy all of Franks
ambitions cutting the hair and
chewing the fat Me I dont talk
much

the cigarette from his mouth and taps its ash into

ED (VO)
--Il just cut the hair

LATE IN THE DAY

The barbershop is empty of customers Late sun slants in
through the front window The two barbers--the narrator and
his brother-in-law--sit in two of the barber chairs idly
reading magazines

Beat

FRANK
Says here that the Russians exploded
n A-bomb and theres not a damn thing
we can do about it

ED
Uh-huh

FRANK
How dya like them apples

FRANK
-Ed

ED
Huh

FRANK

Russians exploded an A-bomb
ED

Yeah
FRANK
(shaking his head)
Jesus
ED (VO)

Now being a barber is a lot like
being a barman or a soda-jerk theres
not much to it once youve learned
the basic moves For the kids theres
the Butch or the Heinie

We cut to examples of the haircuts as they are ticked off

ED (VO)
the Flat Top the Ivy the Crew
the Vanguard the Junior Contour
and occasionally the Executive
Contour Adults get variations on
the same along with the Duck Butt
the Timberline

Ed trims the fringe around a balding head

ED (VO)
-and something we call the Alpine
Rope Toss

He snips one long lonely strand of hair and carefully drapes
it across a bald pate

ED (VO)
-I lived in a little bungalow on
Napa Street The place was OK I
guess it had an electric ice box
gas hearth and a garbage grinder
build into the sink You might say I
had it made

We float slowly toward a white bungalow on a quiet street as
a black coupe pulls into the driveway

ED (VO)
--Oh yeah There was one other
thing

We track in through a bedroom door to discover a woman putting
on a girdle
ED (VO)
--Doris kept the books at
Nirdlingers a small department
store on Main Street Unlike me
Doris liked the work accounting
she liked knowing where everything
stood And she got a ten per cent
employee discount on whatever she
wanted--nylon stockings

Close on her legs as she rolls up a stocking and clips it to
the garter

ED (VO)
-make-up and perfume

Close on an atomiser misting her bosom with Jungle Gardenia
by Tuvache

ED (VO)
--She wore a lot of perfume

Doris in a flouncy dress is setting coasters on a coffee
table

ED (VO)
--Doriss boss Big Dave Brewster
was married to Ann Nirdlinger the
department store heiress Tonight
they were coming over for dinner--as
Doris said we were ‘entertaining’

Ed sits on the living-room davenport in an uncomfortable
suit smoking

ED (VO)
---Me I dont like entertaining

The doorbell rings

THE DOOR

Ed opens it to reveal a large man in a suit and his demure
bird-like wife

DAVE
How ya doin Ed

ED
OK Take your coat Ann
DINNER TABLE
The two couples are in the middle of the meal

DAVE
Japs had us pinned down in Buna for
something like six weeks Well I
gotta tell ya I thought we had it
tough but Jesus we had supply
They were eating grubs nuts
thistles When we finally up and
bust off the beach we found Arnie
Bragg kid missing on recon the
Japs had eaten the sonofabitch if
youll pardon the uh And this
was a scrawny pimply kid too nothin
to write home about I mean I never
wouldve ya know so what do I say
honey When I dont like dinner
what do I say

Ann smiles wanly

DAVE
I say Jesus honey Arnie Bragg--
again

He roars with laughter
Ed gives an acknowledging smile

DAVE
-Arnie Bragg--again

He dries his eyes with the corner of a napkin

DAVE
Were you in the service Ed

ED
No Dave I wasnt

DORIS
Ed was 4F on account of his fallen
arches

DAVE

Mm thats tough

FRONT PORCH
Ed is standing alone on the porch watching the sun go down
Crickets chirp From inside the house we hear laughter and
clattering dishes

ED (VO)
-Yeah I guess Doris liked all
that he-man stuff Sometimes I had
the feeling that she and Big Dave
were a lot closer than they let on

He turns and looks through the screen door into the house

Across the dim living room we can see a sliver of the brightly
lit kitchen Big Dave wearing a frilly apron stands at the
counter drying dishes His broad back heaves with laughter
while Doris just hidden by the wall chats away handing
dishes across

ED (VO)
-The signs were all there plain
enough--not that I was gonna prance
about it mind you Its a free
country

Footsteps approach the front porch
With the squeak of the screen door Big Dave emerges

DAVE
Holding down the porch area

Ed gives a half-grin of wry acknowledgement Big Dave relaxes
forearms against the porch railing gazing out at the front
lawn

DAVE
--Thats quite a wife you got there

ED

DAVE
Shes a rare one

ED
Hows business Dave

DAVE
Couldnt be better Thesere boom
times in retailing Were opening
another store Big Daves Annex

there on Garson This is strictly
haberdashery--casual wear pyjamas
ladies foundations and undergarments
Matter of fact Im thinking of making
Doris the comptroller Howre things
at the uh the barbershop

ED
All right I guess

DAVE
Fine Fine Well you might want
to drop by the Annex when we open
update your suit--course youre in
the smock all day

He chuckles

DAVE
-Say where do you get those things
anyway

ED

Specialty store down in Sacramento

DAVE
Uh-huh

There is a silence At length gazing out at the lawn Big
Dave clears his throat

CHURCH

ED (VO)
Doris and I went to church once a
week

We are tilting down a long stained-glass window depicting
the resurrection of Christ

ED (VO)
-Usually Tuesday night

Faintly we hear an amplified voice

CALLER
I seven

Ed sits at a long table staring at the window a lit
cigarette in his mouth
CALLER
--Bee Four

ED (VO)
Doris wasnt big on divine worship

Doris is concentrating on the six cards spread in front of
her

ED (VO)
-and I doubt if she believed in
life everlasting shed most likely
tell you that our reward is on this
earth and bingo is probably the extent
of it

Still focused on her cards Doris mutters to Ed

DORIS
Watch your card honey

CALLER
I sixteen

Ed continues to gaze off at the window smoke pluming from
his cigarette

ED (VO)
I wasnt crazy about the game but
I dont know it made her happy and
I found the setting peaceful

CALLER
Gee nine

Doris sucks in her breath

DORIS
Jesus bingo--BINGO

BARBERSHOP

Sun slants in through the big window at the end of the day
Ed sweeps hair trimmings looking intently down at the floor
a cigarette dangling from his lip Frank sits on one of the
vinyl waiting chairs talking at Eds back

FRANK
--SO you tie your own flies Ed I
mean if youre really serious You
tie your own flies you do a--I know
its matickless I know people say
hey you can buy flies at the store--
but you can buy your fish at the
store Ed you see what Im saying

ED
Uh-huh

FRANK
The point is theres a certain art
to the process The point is not
merely to provide and let me point
out these fish are not as dumb as
you might think

ED
Uh-huh

FRANK
Sportsmanship Thats my point June
fly Ed Mosquito Which of these
Well what fish do you seek

ED
Yeah

FRANK

Sure go to the store Go there
describe to the man where you will
be fishing and for what and the
weather conditions sun no sun
whatnot and so forth and then you
might as well have the man go ahead
and sell you the goddamn FISH Ed

We see a black-suited figure approaching through the windows
at the far end of the shop He is almost blown out by the
late-day sunlight hitting the window

FRANK
-My point is this is a man who
knows nothing no matter how much you
tell him so sell him the goddamn
FISH Ed

The bell over the front door tinkles and the swarthy middle-
aged man walks in He is well dressed--perhaps a little too
snazzily for this small town--and has a sporty pencil
mustache

MAN
OK boys which of you gets the
privilege

FRANK
Were just closing friend

MAN
Oh happy days I wish I was doing
well enough to turn away business
More power to ya brother The public
be damned

FRANK
Hey whats your problem friend

with posted hours--

Ed cuts in with a jerk of the head

ED
Ill take care of him go ahead
Frank Have a seat mister

Frank looks sourly at the stranger

FRANK
You sure Eddie

ED
Yeah yeah--go home

As Frank leaves

FRANK
In your ear mister

The stranger chuckles

STRANGER
Oh those fiery Mediterraneans Say
Not so fast there brother--

Ed has switched on the clippers but the stranger waves him
back he lifts off a toupee

STRANGER
--Pretty good huh Fools even the
experts 100 percent human hair
handcrafted by Jacques of San
Francisco and Id hate to have to
tell you what I paid for it
Ed starts

He twists

ED
Uh-huh

STRANGER
Yes its a nice rug Im paying for
it down on the installment plan

to trim the strangers fringe

STRANGER
-A lot of folks live with the pate
exposed They say the dames think

just not good grooming--and grooming
my friend is probably the most
important thing in business--after
personality of course

around to offer his hand

STRANGER
-Creighton Tolliver pleased to

ED
Ed Crane What brings you to Santa
Rosa

CREIGHTON

BATHROOM DOORWAY

It is evening Ed leans against the bathroom doorjamb
contemplatively off hands thrust into his pockets a
cigarette between his lips pluming smoke

ED (VO)
Dry cleaning

The reverse show Doris soaking in the tub reading a magazine

ED (VO)

-Was I crazy to be thinking about
it Was he a huckster or opportunity
the real McCoy

Ed takes the cigarette from his mouth exhales
ED (VO)
-My first instinct was no no
the whole idea was nuts But maybe
that was the instinct that kept me
locked up in the barbershop nose
against the exit afraid to try
turning the knob What if I could
get the money

DORIS
Honey

ED
Mm

She lifts one leg and rests the heel on the rim of the tub

DORIS
Shave my legs will ya

Ed saunters over perches on the tub and puts the cigarette
back in his mouth to free his hands He picks up a bar of
soap and starts soaping the leg

He sets down the soap and picks up a safety razor

The razor takes long slow strokes along the lather dark
bits of hair flecking the white foam

ED (VO)
It was clean No water Chemicals

He shakes the razor in the tub Shavings float away across
the soap-slicked water

DORIS
(absently as she
reads)
Gimme a drag

Ed pulls the cigarette from his mouth between two fingers
uses the two fingers to flip it over and holds it for Doris
as she sucks

He brings the cigarette now marked with lipstick back to
his own mouth She murmurs

DORIS
--Love ya honey

A DOOR
We hear a voice muffled through the door breaking into
laughter

A hand enters to knock

VOICE
Yeah come in

The door swings open to show Creighton in his shirtsleeves
sitting on the bed talking on the phone A tray of room-
service dishes sits near him

He is bald his hairpiece sits on the pillow next to him

CREIGHTON
(into the phone)
OK yeah Ill see you tomorrow

He hangs up looks quizzically at Ed

CREIGHTON
---Oh I thought you were the

and hands Ed a glass

CREIGHTON

Heres to ya uh

ED
Ed

They both knock back the whiskey Creighton leans back and
gives Ed a heavy-lidded stare a faint smile on his lips
his hairpiece slightly askew

Ed stares back

After a beat without taking his eyes of Ed Creighton reaches
up and loosens his tie An almost imperceptible wink

Ed stares

ED
-Was that a pass

CREIGHTON
(hoarsely)

Creighton throws up his hands apologetically

BARBERSHOP

We are looking down at the top of an eight-year-olds crew
cut as clippers buzz its perimeter

Frank reads a magazine The youngster reads a comic as Ed
works his head

ED
Frank

FRANK
Huh

the door Ed gives Frank a considering stare

ED
--Im gonna take his hair and throw
it out in the dirt

FRANK
What the--

ED
Im gonna mingle it with common house
dirt

FRANK

What the hell are you talking about
Ed turns back to the counter to hang up his clippers

ED
I dont know Skip it

EXT EDS HOUSE

It is twilight Ed lifts the latch on the front gate and
cigarette in his mouth heads up the walk

Music filters out from the house
INT EDS HOUSE

Ed walks though the living room hands in his pockets The
music emanates from a radio in the bedroom

DORIS
Ed

A track forward reveals Doris sitting at a vanity doing her
hair Her dress is half zipped at the back

DORIS
-Gimme a zip
Ed walks over behind her

ED
Where you going

DORIS

told you last week for the Christmas
Push

ED
Yeah right

We are close on the zipper as Eds hand takes the tab pauses
the lowers it slightly Her back blooms through the dark
fabric of the dress

He slides the zipper up and Doris reaches for a perfume
atomizer

DORIS
Come on get ready Its important

ED
Nah go ahead Im not big on parties

DORIS
Oh dont be a grump

SALES FLOOR
It is festooned with streamers

Ed leans against a wall one hand dug into a pocket the
other bringing a cigarette to his lips

Band music plays and Nirdlingers employees whirl on the
dance floor Bobby-soxed teenagers Lindy-hop and pass palms
over their knees

A thin young man in a sports coat stands next to Ed watching
his Adams apple bobbing

YOUNG MAN
Wild man

He goes out onto the dance floor Ed left by himself gazes
across the floor

His view broken by dancers crosses shows Big Dave worriedly
talking to Doris
Doris reacts angrily

Big Dave morosely absorbs the angry words from Doris He
glances up toward Ed and notices his gaze with consternation
He gives Doris a jerk of the head and she too looks over

VOICE
You in ladies wear

The young man with the Adams apple is back looking out at
the floor snapping his fingers

ED
--Huh

YOUNG MAN
Havent I seen you up in ladies
wear

ED

YOUNG MAN
Uh-huh Some beat huh

ED

YOUNG MAN

the angora

ED
Uh-huh

A hand is laid on Eds shoulder It is Big Dave he leans in
to murmur

DAVE
Ed Can I talk to you

BIG DAVES OFFICE

Music from the party drifts in only faintly The office is
built into a corner of the sales floor It is dominated by a
large desk A large window on the far side affords a partial
view of the floor

DAVE
Siddown Siddown
Ed sits in a leather chair in front of the desk Dave fumbles
nervously on top of the desk for a cigar He trims the end
of the cigar with a short double-bladed knife with a steel

grip

DAVE
--Souveniered it off a Jap in New
Guinea

He hands one cigar to Ed takes one for himself then drags
up a chair to face Eds

DAVE
-I guess youre wondering what
Doris was so hot about

The office is dark the only illumination coming from the
window onto the bright sales floor behind Big Dave Ed leans
forward for Dave to light his cigar

DAVE
Thesere Havanas Romeo and
Juliets Private stock

Dave having lit Eds cigar draws nervously on his own

DAVE
Ed I

ED
What is it Dave

Dave breaks down weeping He buries his face in his hands
the burning cigar in his right hand perilously close to his
hair

DAVE
Ed Ive been weak

His shoulders heave

DAVE
-lve uh Ive uh thanks

Ed has taken Daves cigar so that he wont burn himself

DAVE
-lve uh Oh Jesus Ive been

DAVE
--Oh Jesus

-Why dont you just pay him Dave

-Doris she was pretty hot about

party

He rises and clears his throat as he rubs the tears from his
face

DAVE
---Z look all right

PULLING ED

He has left the office to wander through an adjacent room
lit only by spill from the party It is the music department
pianos and spinets are arranged across the floor

ED (VO)
In a way I felt bad for Big Dave I
knew the ten grand was going to pinch
him where it hurt

Ed sits on a piano stool next to a standing ashtray He takes
out a cigarette lights it off his cigar stubs out the cigar

ED (VO)
--But Doris was two-timing me and I
guess somewhere that pinched a
little too

His attention is caught by a distant knock of wood Someone
is raising the key-guard on a piano across the room

The person can only be seen only obscurely from three-
quarters behind through the sales floors jumble of
haphazardly arranged instruments The person begins to play

Ed listens The piece is slow sweet almost a lullaby

The player unaware that there is an audience plays on and
Ed listens eyes narrowed against the smoke curling past his
face

The piece ends
ED
That was pretty

The player turns surprised It is a young woman

ED
---Did you make that up

YOUNG WOMAN
Oh no That was written by Mr Ludwig
van Beethoven

Ed nods recognition of the name

ED
That was quite something

YOUNG WOMAN
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas

ED
That was something Im Ed Crane

YOUNG WOMAN
I know who you are Mr Crane

His look shows surprise

YOUNG WOMAN
-My father used to take me with
him when he got his hair cut Walter
Abundas

Eds head tilts back in acknowledgment

YOUNG WOMAN
-Im Rachel Abundas Everyone calls
me Birdy

ED
Sorry I just didnt remember

BIRDY

expected to remember every skinny
girl who comes in with her dad

Ed give a wry smile

ED
-You dont like the music out there

A woman calls sharply from offscreen

DORIS

BY A BARN

Wops in Sunday clothing greet each other around tables piled
with food

A small child runs up to his mother yanks on her dress and
screams

CHILD

Surrounded by cheering children with a jug of wine slung
over his shoulder Frank is riding an enormous pig He slaps
at the pigs ass with a large straw hat

ED (VO)
That was when she started drinking

Doris is standing by one of the tables drinking red wine
from a water glass Ed stands nearby

A large woman hugs Doris

picnic table set out with pies in a row

VOICES

VOICES

An old man stands by with a stopwatch
OLD MAN

He clicks the timer

OLD MAN
--Go

Frank and the line of children plunge their faces into the
line of blueberry pies

The other picnickers cheer them on
ELSEWHERE

Ed and Doris approach the innocent-looking young couple
accepting congratulations

Doris holding her empty glass is not a happy drunk

DORIS
‘Gratulations Gina Its so goddamn

ED

Congratulations Gina

DORIS

ED
Honey

Doris calls back over her shoulder
DORIS
Congratulations on your goddamn

cherries

As Ed and Doris recede we hear her petulant
DORIS
--Leggo my goddamn elbow

ELSEWHERE

In a long shot we see Frank at the crest of a hill staggering
slowly painfully toward a tree In his right hand he
clutches a trophy

When he reaches the tree he swings his free hand up against
it leans forward and vomits

CAR
Late afternoon driving home

Ed drives Doris sits in the front passenger seat snoring
lightly Frank sits in the back seat hugging his trophy to
his chest eyes closed murmuring

FRANK
I never wanna see another blueberry
pie
Silence
FRANK
-I never even wanna hear those
words
Doris moans
More silence
FRANK

-Dont says those words Ed
EXT BUNGALOW

It is twilight Eds coupe is parked in the driveway He is
just rounding the back of the car to open the passenger-side
door He pulls Doris from the car half asleep half drunk

INT BUNGALOW

The door swings open and Ed stumbles in supporting Doris
who has one arm draped around his neck He helps her into
the bedroom and eases her onto the bed

He sits on the edge of the bed and looks down at her

Shadows from branches just outside wave across her face She
is breathing through her open mouth her face is moist with
perspiration

ED (VO)

Id met Doris blind on a double-date
with a loudmouthed buddy of mine who
was seeing a friend of hers from
work We went to a movie Doris had
a flask we killed it She could put
it away At the end of the night she
said she liked it I didnt talk much
A couple weeks later she suggested--

A harsh jangle from the telephone Doris moans but does not
wake Ed rises and does to the living room and picks up the
phone

ED
Yeah

VOICE
Ed its Big Dave I gotta talk to

ED

DAVE

ED

He hangs up

He nudges Doris
ED
Honey

She murmurs

ED
Honey

She rolls away and burrows into a pillow
Ed opens her purse and pokes through it
NIRDLINGERS

We are looking over Eds shoulder as he hesitantly swings
open a door

It reveals Big Daves office quiet and rather dark

A down-facing bankers lamp on the desk illuminates Big Daves
hands on the desktop

ED
-Dave
DAVE
Come on in
Ed enters sits
An awkward silence
ED

Whats the problem Big Dave
Another silence

DAVE
-Im ruined

His hands writhe on the desktop

DAVE
--It ruined me This money No annex
Im all shot to hell

ED
So you paid the guy

Big Dave stares without speaking

After a long beat
DAVE
-What kind of man are you

ED
-Huh

DAVE
What kind of man are you

ED
Big Dave--

DAVE
Id understand if youd walked in
here Socked me in the nose Whatever
I deserved it

ED
I uh
DAVE

Big Dave sighs
DAVE

--Yeah I paid up As you well know
And then I went and found the pansy

He looks at Ed

DAVE
--Got nothin to say huh Yeah
well you already know the story I
didnt I hadda beat it out of the
pansy Your money

No response

DAVE
-What kind of man are you

Big Dave rises

DAVE
--Well

He crosses around the desk and adds sadly
DAVE
-e-Im all shot to hell

Ed starts to rise but Big Dave is already looming over him
Big Dave bear-hugs him and then spins him into a wall

Ed hits the wall and bounces off back into Big Dave Big
Dave wallops him in the stomach Ed doubles over

DAVE
-What kind of man are you

Big Dave hurls him against the desk then slams his face
against the desktop Eds hands scrabble at the top of the
desk as Big Dave grabs him by the neck and lifts He slams
him face-first into the window between the office and the
dark sales floor

Ed twists around the back of his head now pressed against
the glass Big Daves hands lock around his throat

Big Dave sweats and strains
A crack shoots up the pane of glass

Eds hand sweeps up and plunges something into Big Daves
neck

Big Dave grunts and turns away gurgling His hands go up to
his throat

Ed watches He is holding Big Daves cigar trimmer

Big Dave takes a couple of deliberate steps backward his
head twisted away

He falls back tripped up by a chair which spins him face-
down onto the floor

Big Dave crawls away face-down across the floor on his knees
but with his hands still at his throat His face and knees
awkwardly support his weight as if he were pushing something
across the floor with his nose

He reaches a corner but still pushes forward wedging himself
in legs still scraping away as if to push himself through
the wall Blood is pooling out from under him

Big Daves legs are still working His gurgling continues

Ed watches
Big Daves legs start to move furiously They convulse His
whole body shakes as he goes into shock

Ed watches

Big Dave stops shaking He remains wedged awkwardly into the
corner face-down He is still

The room is very quiet
Ed looks down at his hands

He walks across the room pushes the door open and walks
across the darkened sales floor

EXT STORE

Ed walks to his car He does not look about is not
particularly furtive He gets into the car He starts the
ignition

EXT HOUSE

He pulls up sits motionless for a beat Gradually something
draws his attention he cocks his head and looks up through
the windshield

A branch creaks and sways in the breeze
INT HOUSE

Ed gets into bed next to Doris He stares at the ceiling
Wind rustles outside

The shadow of a branch on the ceiling nods in time with the
wind

He looks at Doris

Her face is still lightly sheened with sweat but her mouth
is closed now her breathing more peaceful The leafy shadows
play over her face

ED (VO)

--It was only a couple of weeks
after we met that Doris suggested
getting married I said Dont you
wanna get to know me more She said
Why does it get better She looked
at me like I was a dope which Ive
never really minded from her And
she had a point I guess We knew
each other as well then as now

He is gazing at her

ED (VO)
--Anyway well enough

Sound and image face

RESIDENTIAL STREET

It is evening Ed is pulling up to a house on a tree-lined
street similar to his own He gets out of his car and goes
up the walk and a man sitting on the porch swing holds up a
hand of greeting

MAN
Lo Ed

ED

He steps up on the porch

The man is holding a tumbler of whiskey and ice that clinks
as the swing moves His skin glistens with drinkers sweat
and he has the slightly expansive manner of someone whos

next to Walter

ED AT A TABLE

It is a long table with chairs stretching down both sides
one side for prisoners the other for visitors The room is
empty except for a guard and an elderly woman who sits across
from a younger woman at the far end of the table The younger
woman in a prison smock is wailing The elderly woman is
holding her hand

Ed sits across from an empty chair clutching a flower-printed
toiletries kit There are echoing voices suggesting large
spaces outside the room

He sits and waits

Approaching footsteps

The door opens A large prison matron steps aside to let
Doris enter

Doris looks lost in a prison-issue jumper that is too big
for her Her hair is uncurled and bedraggled Not only is
she not made-up she has a couple of bruises and a cut on
her lip

As Ed stands she gives a hollow look around

ED
Honey I brought your make-up
She looks at him
DORIS
Honey
ED

How are you
She shrugs

DORIS
I dont know whats going on I--

ED
What happened to you

She shakes her head

DORIS
--I dont know what happened to Big

DORIS

DORIS

ED
Dont tell ‘em anything Were getting

Doris finally looks at him

DORIS
Should I should I tell you why

ED
You dont have to tell me anything

Her gaze drifts away again She notices the sobbing woman

DORIS
Jesus Christ

Doris looks around and laughs

DORIS
--My books used to be perfect Anyone

the whole goddamn store

ED
Honey

DORIS

BARBERSHOP

Ed sits in a waiting-customer chair wearing his smock Frank

FRANK

BANK

Ed and Frank sit waiting on a bench in the high-vaulted lobby
Frank looks uncomfortable in an ill-fitting suit As they
wait he looks nervously about

In a hushed voice

FRANK
Theyre just people like you and me
Ed Remember that

ED
Uh-huh

FRANK

big front so that people will trust
them with their money This is why

age emerges

MAN
Ah-hah It would be best if he waited

He goes to the glass-paned doorway to his office Frank
trailing dejectedly behind They enter the door closes and
we hear their muffled voices from inside the sense of the
words lost

Ed sits and watches the two men perform their pantomime of
business Frank nervously reads documents with one hand cupped
to his forehead for concentration the banker passes
successive documents across his desk with a word of
explanation for each as Frank signs
Ed takes out a cigarette and lights it watching impassively

ED (VO)
The barbershop Doris and Franks
father had worked thirty years to
own it free and clear Now it got
signed over to the bank and the
bank signed some money over to Frank
and Frank signed the money over

TRACKING POINT OF VIEW

It is midday We are tracking along the sidewalk toward a
long cream-colored Packard parked at the curb A couple of
kids have stopped to peer into the cars windows the car is
no doubt the fanciest in town

ED (VO)
to Freddy Riedenschneider who
got into town two days later

Ed coming up the sidewalk looks up at the storefront a
restaurant with a large window with a plush red drape that
obscures the interior Gilt lettering on the window spells
out DaVincis

ED (VO)
-and told me to meet him at
DaVincis for lunch

lone occupant sits with his back to us holding open a menu
as he orders from a facing waitress

DRIVING POINT OF VIEW

We are looking at pedestrians on the sidewalk through the
windshield of a moving car

ED (VO)
All going about their business It
seemed like I knew a secret--a bigger
one even then what had really happened
to Big Dave something none of them
knew

On Ed driving

ED (VO)
-Like I had made it to the outside
somehow and they were all still
struggling way down below

ED IN BED
Arms folded behind his head staring at the ceiling
On the ceiling is the moving shadow of a tree limb
A distant muffled knock

Ed turns his head

FRONT DOOR

Ed opens it as he finishes cinching a bathrobe

The woman waiting on the front porch is dressed in black a
black dress and a black veiled hat that is too big for her
bird-like frame

Wind rustles in the trees behind her
She stares at Ed

ED
Ann

For the first time we hear her speak in a low tremulous
voice

Hello Ed

ED
Ann Will you come in

She shakes her head

ANN
--No No its very late

Ed nods

After an uncomfortable beat through which she continues to
stare

ED
--Im so sorry about your loss

ANN
Yes Thank you

ED
Of course you know Doris had nothing
to do with it Nothing at all
She lays a black-gloved hand on his arm

She falls

She gives

ANN
Oh I know Dont worry Ed I came
to tell you

ED
Yes Ann

ANN
And you should tell Doris

silent The trees behind her rustle
a wary look back Then confidingly to Ed

ANN
---You know how Big Dave loved
camping And the out-of-doors

Ed is puzzled

She gives

ED
Yes

ANN
We went camping last summer In
Eugene Oregon Outside of Eugene

him a searching look hoping it seems that

this significant
ED
-Yes
ANN

At night there were lights--we both
saw them We never told anyone
outside of our official report

ED
Ann--

ANN
A spacecraft I saw the creatures
They led Big Dave onto the craft He
never told anyone what they did
outside of his report Of course he
told me No one else

he
ED
Ann--

ANN
The government knows I cannot repeat
it to you But this thing goes deep
Ed This was not your wife I goes
deep and involves the government
There is a great deal of fear You
know how certain circles would find
it--the knowledge--a threat They
try to limit it and--

ED
Ann will you come in sit down
maybe have a drink

ANN
Sometimes knowledge is a curse Ed
After this happened things changed
Big Dave he never touched me again

Ed says nothing
She touches his arm

ANN
--Tell Doris not to worry I know
it wasnt her Perhaps this will
bring it out finally Perhaps now
it will all come out

She turns and heads down the walk

Her high-heeled footsteps echo on the walk then the sidewalk
then are lost in the rustle of leaves

Ed watches her go a small black figure growing smaller
PRISON MEETING ROOM

It is an unadorned room with a simple wooden table and chairs
One high window lets in a shaft of sunlight

Ed and Doris sit at the table Freddy Riedenschneider stands
to one side staring up at the high window hands dug into
his pockets

All three are motionless for a long beat Finally

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
He starts

-It stinks

DORIS
But its true

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
I dont care its true its not
true it stinks You say he was being
blackmailed by who You dont know
For having an affair with who You
dont know Did anyone else know
about it Probably not you dont
know

ED
I knew about it Big Dave told me
about it and the spot he was putting
himself in by getting the money

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
Terrific Your husband backs you up
Thats terrific

pacing

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
--Youve gotta give me something to
work with Freddy Riedenschneider is
good but hes not a magician He
cant just wave his little wand in
the air and make a plausible defense
materialize Look Look at what the
other side is gonna run at us They
got the company books prepared by
you--cooked by you--thats Motive
They got a murder scene you had
access to Thats Opportunity They
got that little trimmer thing he was
stabbed in the throat with--a dames
weapon--

ED
It was Big Daves

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
--dont interrupt me--thats Means
They got a fine upstanding pillar of
the business community as a victim
and then they got you a disgruntled
number-juggling underling who on the
day in question was drunk as a skunk
and whose alibi for the time in
question is being passed out at home
alone

ED
I was with her

Riedenschneider gives him a hard look

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
-Like I say it stinks

Another long pause

ED
--1I killed him

Riedenschneider eyes him Wheels start turning

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
OK we forget the blackmail You
killed him How come

ED
He and Doris were having an affair

Doris eyes him His manner does not reveal anything

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
OK how did you know

ED
I just knew A husband knows

Riedenschneider rolls his eyes

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
Will anyone else say they knew

ED
I dont know I dont think so

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
How did you get into the store

ED
I took Doriss keys

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
Will anyone say they saw you there
On your way there In there On your
was back

ED
--I dont think so

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
Will anyone corroborate and goddamn
part of your story at all

Ed returns Riedenschneiders stare Riedenschneider resumes
pacing

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
-Come on people You cant help
each other like that Lets be
realistic now Lets look at our
options Well frankly I dont see
any options

A nod of the head indicates Doris

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
-I cannot present Story A

Another nod indicates Ed

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
--I cannot present Story B I could
plead you for a nutcase but you look
too composed I could offer a guilty
plea and in return they dont give
you the juice but I dont think you
want to spend the rest of your life
in Chino and I know you didnt hire
Freddy Riedenschneider to hold your
hand at a sentencing hearing Hell
you couldve gotten Lloyd Garroway
for that No were not giving up
yet you hired Freddy Riedenschneider
it means youre not throwing in
the towel I litigate I dont
capitulate All right no options
we gotta think All right we go
back to the blackmail thing It
titillates its open ended

His pacing becomes more animated

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
--And it makes him the bad guy--
ya dig around ya never know
something unsavory from his past he
approaches you to help with the money
its too late his past comes back

to haunt him whos to say

He is heading for the door

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
-Yeah OK Forget the jealous
husband thing thats silly were
going with the blackmail Ill be in
touch

The door slams
HOTEL LOBBY

The camera drifts in toward the reception desk Ed talks to
the clerk behind the desk but the scene plays silently we
hear only Eds narration

ED (VO)
Of course there was one person
who could confirm Doriss story or
plenty of it the dry-cleaning
pansy

The desk clerk is shaking his head

ED (VO)
--But hed left the hotel skipped
out on his bill

HALLWAY

It is a rooming-house hallway A stern middle-aged woman is
on the hall telephone This too plays silently under the
narration

ED (VO)
Hed also disappeared from the
residence he gave me

EDS LIVING ROOM

We are drifting in toward Ed who nods at the telephone and
then cradles it He stares down at the business card he holds

ED (VO)
--Owing two months rent How could
I have been so stupid Handing over
10000 For a piece of paper And
the man gone like a ghost

PULLING BACK FROM ED

In a different living room He sits on a sofa hands clasped
behind his head listening For the first time as the voice-
over continues we hear atmosphere from the scene piano
music

ED (VO)
-disappeared into thin air
vaporized like the Nips at Nagasaki
Gone now All gone The money gone
Big Dave gone Doris going How could
I have been so stupid

The continuing pull-back reveals Walter Abundas on a nearby
chair also listening as Birdy plays

Walter holds a drink in one hand he is nodding his eyelids
droop As the piano piece reaches its mournful conclusion
his chin alights on his chest his eyelids tremble closed
and he starts lightly to snore

BARBERSHOP

The distinctive buzz of electric hairclippers bangs in at
the cut Ed and Frank stand behind their respective chairs
administering haircuts

The customer in Eds chair is in white shirtsleeves that do

not hide rolls of fat He has a hot towel over his face that
does not slow his speech although it does muffle it to some
extent

CUSTOMER
She makes this stuff she calls it
gatto its got egg in there its
got sugar its got--its cake
basically except she calls it gatto
Like if you dont call it cake maybe
you wont put on any weight like I
need to eat gatto you know what Im
saying This stuff if Ive hada
square meal Ive had my steak and
potatoes I can just have another
cup of coffee afterward I wont ask

His voice turns into a drone under the narration
ED (VO)
Sooner or later everyone needs a
haircut

CUSTOMER
Got the recipe from a magazine
womans magazine

ED (VO)
We were working for the bank now We
kept cutting the hair trying to
stay afloat make the payments tread
water day by day day by day

CRANE DOWN

Inside a courtroom we boom down toward the defendants table
the fat customers drone turning into the drone of the bailiff
reading an indictment Doris stands next to Freddy
Riedenschneider

ED (VO)
Most people think someones accused
of a crime they haul em in and
bring em to trial but its not
like that its not that fast The
wheels of justice turn slow

BAILIFF
-did willfully and with malice
aforethought take the life of one
David Allen Brewster a human being

ED (VO)
They have an arraignment and then
the indictment and they entertain
motions to dismiss and postpone
and change the venue and alter this
and that and the other They empanel
a jury which brings more motions
and they set a trial date and then
change the date and then often as
not theyll change it again

BAILIFF

BARBERSHOP

Booming down toward the fat man

ED (VO)

hair

CUSTOMER

OPERA SINGERS

We are panning photographic portraits of opera singers in
character wearing the wardrobe of different eras armies
dukedoms and boudoirs and displaying the heights and depths
of various emotions their mouths stretched wide in song We
pan off the pictures to discover that we are in a hotel room
floating in toward a bed on which Freddy Riedenschneider a
mask over his eyes slumbers

ED (VO)
-Meanwhile Freddy Riedenschneider
slept at the Metropole

RESTAURANT

Tracking in toward Freddy Riedenschneider who sits twirling
spaghetti with a fork against a spoon

ED (VO)
-and shoveled it in at DaVincis

LATERAL TRACK

From inside a car Pedestrians bustle along a sidewalk Among
them scurries a weedy little man who has one hand clamped to
the crown of his hat to keep it in place in a stiff wind

ED (VO)
Hed brought in a private investigator
from Sacramento

LATERAL TRACK
Moving the opposite way A different day but again a crowd
moves along the sidewalk and among them the little man
scuttles in the opposite direction hand still raised to his
hat his forearm and the tilt of his head largely obscuring
his face

ED (VO)
-to nose around into Big Daves
past

PUSHING IN TO ED

In the Abundas living room again again listening to Birdy
at the piano but now the two of them are alone

ED (VO)
I found myself more and more going
over to the Abundass It was a
routine we fell into most every
evening I even went when Walter was
away on his research trips He was a
genealogist had traced back his
side of the family seven generations
his late wifes eight It seemed
like a screwy hobby But then maybe
all hobbies are Maybe Walter found
something there in the old county
courthouses hospital file rooms
city archives property rolls
registries something maybe like
what I found listening to Birdy play
Some kind of escape Some kind of
peace

The piano music ends in a sustain which begins to fade but
then is snapped by a sharp clang

PRISON DOOR SWINGS OPEN

We are pushing into the high-windowed prison meeting room
None of its three occupants is moving

The tableau consists of Doris staring down at the table the
private investigator sitting on a straightbacked chair tipped
back against a wall his arms folded across his chest his
fedora pushed back on his head a toothpick clamped between
his teeth and Freddy Riedenschneider standing hands clasped
behind his back gazing with a distant smile up into the

shaft of light that slants through the high window
A warder shuts the door behind Ed

Doris and the private investigator turn to note his entrance
Riedenschneider does not

Ed pulls out a chair across from Doris clasps his hands on
top of hers

ED
Lo honey

She looks at his hands on top of hers
A long beat

Still gazing up into the shaft of light Freddy
Riedenschneider announces

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
-They got this guy in Germany
Fritz something-or-other Or is it
Maybe its Werner Anyway hes got
this theory you wanna test something
you know scientifically--how the
planets go round the sun what
sunspots are made of why the water
comes out of the tap--well you gotta
look at it But sometimes you look
at it your looking changes it Ya
cant know the reality of what
happened or what wouldve happened
if you hadden a stuck in your goddamn
schnozz So there is no ‘what
happened Not in any sense that we
can grasp with our puny minds Because
our minds out minds get in the
way Looking at something changes
it They call it the ‘Uncertainty
Principle Sure it sounds screwy
but even Einstein says the guys on
to something

His gaze up at the window breaks He strolls around the room
still smiling

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
-Science Perception Reality
Doubt

He stops to examine a bur on his fingernail
RIEDENSCHNEIDER
-Reasonable doubt Im sayin
sometimes the more you look the
less you really know Its a fact A
proved fact In a way its the only
fact there is This heinie even wrote
it out in numbers

He looks up at the private detective

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
-Burns

With a slight weight shift Burns tips his chair so that its
front legs slap down onto the floor He fishes a small
notebook from an inside pocket

His boredom is profound his only concession to performance
is to move the toothpick from one side of his mouth to the
other where perhaps it will less inhibit speech

BURNS

Riedenschneider nods smiling

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
-Thank you Burns get lost

Burns pockets his notebook adjusts his hat jams his
into his pockets and ambles out of the room

The slam of the door leaves quiet
At length

ED
---SO

Riedenschneiders fixed smile now fades

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
So So This could be your dollys
ticket out of the deathhouse so

Ed and Doris look at each other

ED
---I dont get it

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
Look chum this is a guy from what
I understand told everybody he was
a war hero right Island hopping
practically liberated the Pacific
all by himself with a knife in one
hand and a gun in the other and twenty
yards of Jap guts between his teeth

ED
Yeah

RIEDENSCHNEIDER

And now it turns out this dope spent
the war sitting on his ass in some
boatyard in San Diego You asked for
blackmail let me give you blackmail
Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met about to
open his own business here has been
lying to everybody in this town for

hands
the last four years probably
including half the people sitting on
that jury Well it finally caught
up with him--these dopes it always
does someone threatened to spill
it Somebody knew his dirty little
secret just like your wife says
They called they demanded money

He is looking at Doris

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
-Did Big Dave mention that it was
something about his war service I
dont know I wasnt there you1ll
have to tell us Maybe he specified
maybe he didnt Im not putting
words in your mouth the point is
that this liar this cynical
manipulator this man who through
his lies sneered and belittled the
sacrifice and heroism of all our
boys who did serve and bleed and
puke and die on foreign shores and
who made a fool out of this entire
town turns to you to help him out
of his jam Fat-assed sonofabitch

ED
So who who actually--

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
Who Who I dont know who But
the point is that if Mr Prosecutor
over there had devoted half the time
hes spent persecuting this woman
to even the most cursory investigation
of this schmoes past then we might
know who But we cant know what
really happened Because of Fritz
or Werner or whatever the hell his
name is And because Me Prosecutor
is also a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch
who decided its easier to victimize
your wife Because its easier not
to look Because the more you look
the less you know But the beauty of
it is we dont gotta know We
just gotta show that goddamnit
they dont know Reasonable doubt
Science The atom You explain it
to me Go ahead Try

He chuckles as he heads for the door

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
veah Freddy Riedenschneider sees
daylight We got a real shot at this
folks Lets not get cocky

The door shuts behind him
Doris stares down at the table as at the head of the scene

A silent beat a smile starts to tug at the corners of her
mouth

ED
Honey

The smile twitches and then stays Doris starts to laugh
Ed frowns

ED
---Honey

Her laughter builds almost to hysteria Finally it subsides
and still staring at the tabletop and smiling she shakes
her head

DORIS
What a dope

ABUNDAS LIVING ROOM

Ed sits listening as Birdy plays She talks after a moment
her eyes on the sheet music

BIRDY
He was deaf when he wrote this

ED
Who

BIRDY
Beethoven He created it and yet he
never actually heard it I suppose
he heard it all in his head somehow

Over her continued playing

ED (VO)
So maybe Riedenschneider could get
Doris off Maybe it would all work
out And I thought--I hoped--that
maybe there was a way out for me as
well

A SIGN

The cardboard sign on an easel says COME ONE COME ALL
PETALUMA HIGH SCHOOL TALENT SHOW WEDNESDAY APRIL 29 1949
800 PM

ED (VO)
The girl had talent anyone could
see that And she wasnt some fly-
by-nighter she was just a good clean
kid

SCHOOL GYMNASIUM

A young man holding a saxophone is just leaving the makeshift
stage to a smattering of applause Birdy walks out to the
baby grand that has been set out center stage

ED (VO)
If she was going to have a career
shed need a responsible adult looking
out for her

We track up the rows of folding chairs that have been set

out on the gym floor for the audience of students and parents
many of whom fan themselves with programs We come to rest

on Ed

ED (VO)
-some kind of manager Shed
have contracts to look at be going
on tours playing on the radio maybe
I could help her sort through all of
that without charging her an arm
and a leg just enough to get by

Birdy begins to play for the quietly attentive audience
EXT SCHOOL

Ed is among the crowd streaming from the gym into the warm
summer night He looks around the parking lot

ED (VO)
--I could afford to charge less
than the usual manager not having
to put up a big front like a lot of
these phonies And I could be with
her enough to keep myself feeling
OK

A trace of a frown as he spots her leaning against a car
laughing passing a cigarette back and forth with another
student--a boy

ED (VO)
-Why couldnt that work Why
not

Birdys easy smile remains as Ed approaches but the boys
drops he puts on a face more suitable for meeting adults

BIRDY
Hi Mr Crane

ED
Hello Birdy I thought that was
very good

BIRDY
Oh in there I messed up a little
bit in the scherzo I guess if nobody
noticed its OK Mr Crane this is
Tony a friend of mine Tony Mr
Crane

ED
Hello Tony

TONY
Hello sir

Silence The teens wait for the adult to direct the
conversation Ed has nothing to say At length he clears
his throat

ED
-Well congratulations I guess
Ill be getting home

TONY
Nice to meet you sir

TURANDOT SUITE

It is morning We are tracking past an unmade bed toward the
bathroom where we hear water running

ED (VO)
Anyway thats what I was thinking
about in the days leading up to the
trial It seemed like once that was
over Id be ready for a new start
Freddy Riedenschneider was very
optimistic He was busy preparing

We have rounded the open bathroom door to find Riedenschneider
hunched over the sink toothbrush in hand spitting out water
He rises looks at himself in the mirror sprinkles some

tonic in his hair

ED (VO)
--And finally it came the first
day of the trial

Riedenschneider runs his fingers through his hair

ED (VO)
What Riedenschneider called the
Big Show

He straightens his tie gives his neck a twist
COURTROOM

We are close on the back of Riedenschneiders gleaming hair
He is sitting at the defense table

There is a murmur of a crowd that has yet to be called to
order

FRANK
Wheres the judge How come theres
no judge

Ed and Frank sit next to each other in the first gallery row
directly behind Riedenschneider

FRANK
-Wheres the judge Ed

Ed shrugs Frank looks at Riedenschneiders back

FRANK
--How come the judge doesnt come
out

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
The judge comes in last Hell come
in when Doris gets here

FRANK
So wheres Doris I thought we started
at ten Hey Riedenschneider wheres
Doris

Riedenschneider is curt

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
Shes late

FRANK
Late How can she be late

Riedenschneider doesnt answer Frank turns to Ed

FRANK
-Shes in prison Ed None of us
are in prison and yet were not
late Were on time Ed How can
Doris be late What they dont have
wake-up calls

The murmur of the crowd subsides as a door behind the judges
bench opens and the judge hurriedly enters

The gallery rises but the judge quickly waves them back down
and rather than seating himself leans forward over his
desk to give a peremptory beckoning wave to Riedenschneider
and the prosecutor

JUDGE
Counselors

Riedenschneider puzzled approaches the bench as does his
counterpart from the other table The judge still leaning
forward speaks to them in a low voice that is not audible
from the gallery

The crowd has started murmuring again also in hushed tones
Frank leans in toward Ed

FRANK
Whats going on Ed I thought there
would be arguments The bailiff and
so forth

Ed also puzzled is watching Riedenschneider who suddenly
stiffens As the judge continues to talk Riedenschneider
looks back over his shoulder at Ed

FRANK
-Ed what is this Is this
procedure

The two lawyers nod at the judge and walk back to their
respective tables The judge now summons a uniformed man
standing to one side

JUDGE
Bailiff

As the judge and the bailiff confer Riedenschneider looks
down at his desk and for something to do straightens various
papers

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
I dont understand We had a real
shot at it We could have won this
thing
The Bailiff Announces
BAILIFF

In the matter of the State of
California versus Doris Crane Case
Number 87249 assigned to this Superior
Court

As the bailiff drones Riedenschneider shakes his head

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
--It doesnt make any sense

BARBERSHOP
Late afternoon sun slants in

The shop not open for business is very still Ed in his
courtroom suit sits in one of the vinyl chairs that line
the wall hunched forward forearms on his knees

Frank also still in his suit is up in one of the barber
chairs one hand cupped to his forehead weeping

ED (VO)
Shed hanged herself Id brought
her a dress to wear to court and
shed used the belt I didnt
understand it either At first I
thought maybe it had something to do
with me that shed figured out
somehow how I fit into it and couldnt
stand it couldnt stand knowing

BEDROOM
Night Ed is in bed staring at the ceiling

ED (VO)
That wasnt it I would find out
later For now everything just seemed
ruined

METROPOLE LOBBY

Riedenschneider is at the cashiers desk checking out Behind
him a bellmans cart is piled high with his bags

ED (VO)
Freddy Riedenschneider went back
to Sacramento still shaking his head
saying it was the biggest
disappointment of his professional
career

FRANKS HOUSE
Day Franks kitchen

Frank sits at his kitchen table staring in a bathrobe thrown
over his pyjamas unshaven

ED (VO)
-Frankie fell to pieces I suspect
he was drinking anyway he stopped
coming to work

BARBERSHOP
Ed in his smock works on a customer

ED (VO)
--That left me to keep the place
going or the bank wouldve taken
it

As he uses the electric clippers a cigarette plumes between
his lips He squints against the smoke drifting past his
eyes

ED (VO)
-I was the principal barber now
I hired a new man for the second
chair

Eds former chair is indeed being manned by a newcomer a
gangly young man who animatedly chats up his customer

ED (VO)
--Id hired the guy who did the
least gabbing when he came in for an
interview But I guess the new man
had only kept quiet because he was
nervous once he had the job he
talked from the minute I opened the
shop in the morning

EXT BARBERSHOP

It is evening Ed is locking the barbershop as next to him
on the sidewalk the new man continues to chat gesticulating
to illustrate his store

ED (VO)
--until I locked up at night For
all I know he talked to himself on
the way home

STREET
Ed walks along the sidewalk

ED (VO)
-When I walked home it seemed
like everyone avoided looking at
me

Indeed none of the passers-by establish eye contact their
averted eyes make the crowd a faceless throng

ED (VO)
-as if Id caught some disease
This thing with Doris nobody wanted
to talk about it it was like I was
a ghost walking down the street

HOUSE
As Ed lets himself in

ED (VO)
--And when I got home now the place
felt empty

He sits on the couch and after a beat takes a cigarette
pack from his pocket and taps out a smoke

ED (VO)
--I sat in the house but there was
nobody there I was a ghost I didnt
see anyone no one saw me

BARBERSHOP
Ed is in his smock again operating the clippers

ED (VO)
---Il was the barber

FADE OUT

The drone of the clippers has continued over the black A
voice fades up

VOICE 1
So two blocks later I look at the
change she gave me and golly Im
two bits short

VOICE 2
Two bits short

VOICE 1
So I walk back over to Lintons
find this gal--big argument she
doesnt even recall the transaction

VOICE 2
No recollection

VOICE 1
Doesnt recall the transaction no
recollection so I said Look dear

FADE IN

We are looking at a magazine story Its headline over an
illustration of a cresting wave is WAVE OF THE FUTURE

Underneath are black-and-white photographs of heavy equipment
and racks of clothing on motorized tracks Subheadlines read
NEXT TO GODLINESS - Dry Cleaning Sweeps The Nation - The
Thoroughly Modern Way To Clean
Ed sits in one of the vinyl chairs staring at Life magazine
The offscreen conversation drones on as the new man works on
a customer

NEW MAN
---go ahead look at the menu if
youre in before six oclock its
the whatchamacallit the--

CUSTOMER
Early Bird Special

NEW MAN
What Yeah the Early Riser

Ed flips the pages of the magazine and stops on a photograph
of a dark desert landscape with one bright light hovering in
the sky The caption underneath ROSWELL NEW MEXICO

VOICE
Crane

Ed looks up

A man in a black suit and fedora has directed the question
at the new man who looks up from his gabbling momentarily
slackjawed

ED
-Im Crane

MAN
My name is Diedrickson County medical
examiner

ED
Yeah

DIEDRICKSON

Just came for an informal chat
Diedrickson looks around uncomfortably

DIEDRICKSON
-Why dont I buy you a drink

Ed rises from his chair and as he unbuttons his smock
addresses the new man who still gapes

ED
Dwight you OK here for a few minutes
DWIGHT
Whuh--uh yeah sure Ed take your
time

BAR
It is late afternoon dusty and empty

Ed and Diedrickson sit on adjacent stools Diedrickson cocking
his hat lower to its man-sitting-at-a-bar position

As the bartender approaches

DIEDRICKSON
Rye
ED
Just coffee
DIEDRICKSON
You sure you dont want something

stiffer
Ed shrugs and shakes his head

BARTENDER
Coffee it is

He leaves Diedrickson interlaces his fingers on the bartop
and stares at them After a beat

DIEDRICKSON
--County M E does an autopsy on
anyone who dies in custody I dont
know if you knew that Its routine

Ed doesnt answer Diedrickson after some more staring at
his hands plows on

DIEDRICKSON
--Doesnt become a matter of public
record unless theres foul play
However I dont believe Im
prohibited from telling you this
I guess Im not obliged to tell you
either I dont exactly know But
if I were the man Id want to be
told

ED
Told what
DIEDRICKSON

The bartender has set down the drinks
He takes a hit from his

Diedrickson waits for him to leave

glass Finally
DIEDRICKSON

--Im sorry to add to your burden

Crane but Id want to know it it

A pause
DIEDRICKSON

-Well there it is

Another pause
DIEDRICKSON

--Im sorry

He mutters to himself

DIEDRICKSON
-Hell I hope Ive done the right

thing

ED
My wife and I had not performed

the sex act in many years

Diedrickson stiffens
DIEDRICKSON
(murmuring)

--Jesus

(aloud)
--Well thats not really my

business
He is hastily digging for money

DIEDRICKSON

--Ilm sorry Well there it is
mumbles as he

He leaves a couple of bills on the bar and

leaves
DIEDRICKSON
---Good luck Crane

His retreating footsteps echo down the bar
APARTMENT HALLWAY

It is a dingy hallway lit by bare bulbs Ed stands in the
middle background knocking on a door

ED (VO)
Doris and I had never really talked
much I dont think thats a bad
thing necessarily But it was funny
now I wanted to talk--now with
everyone gone I was alone with
secrets I didnt want and no one to
tell them to anyway

The door opens and Ed is admitted by the unseen tenant
APARTMENT

We hear a low murmuring as we slowly pan the apartment It

is overfurnished with heavy ornate chairs sideboards chests
too big for the space and all going too seed Surface areas
are covered with yellowing lacework or exotic brocades the
one lamp has a veil thrown over it to further scrim down its
feeble light

Our pan brings us onto Ed seated at a small card table across
from a small elderly woman in a shawl who is the source of
the murmuring Her eyes are squeezed shut in concentration

as she mumbles

ED (VO)
I visited a woman who was supposed
to have powers in communicating with
those who had passed across as she
called it She said that people who
passed across were picky about who
theyd communicate with not like
most people you run into on this
side

The woman opens her eyes and looks at Ed

WOMAN
Giff me your hant

Ed places his hand in the center of the table
ED (VO)
--SO you needed a guide who they
didnt mind talking to someone with
a gift for talking to souls

Ed looks at the womans spotted and vein-lined hand as it
rests upon his Her mumbling resumes

ED (VO)

Well first she told me that my
wife was in a peaceful place that
our souls were still connected by
some spiritual bond that she had
never stopped loving me even though
shed done some things she wasnt
proud of

Ed looks up at the old woman

ED (VO)
She was reading me like a book

She is stealing a glance at Ed to check his reaction

ED (VO)
-And then she started talking about
Dolores this and Dolores that
and was there anything I wanted to
tell Dolores and I knew Id just
be telling it to the old bat And
even if somehow Doris could hear it
wouldnt be on account of this so-
called medium

APARTMENT HALLWAY
Ed is leaving

ED (VO)
She was a phony Just another gabber

EXT TENEMENT
Ed emerges from the building

ED (VO)
I was turning into Ann Nirdlinger
Big Daves wife I had to turn my
back on the old lady on the veils
on the ghosts on the dead before
they all sucked me in
Ed disappears into the night
ABUNDAS HOUSE

It is night We are looking through the screen door Walter
Abundas sits in yellow lamplight by a small table on the
side of the staircase over which papers are strewn He is
murmuring into the telephone as he examines the papers
glasses halfway down his nose a drink in one hand

Eds hand enters to rap on the door Walter looks up sets
the phone down and comes to the door

WALTER

ED

STUDIO WAITING ROOM

It is a small square room with straightbacked chairs set
against the walls At the far end of the room a door leads
to a studio from which piano music dully emanates it is a
fast and difficult piece of music

Ed sits waiting He is the only adult two or three youngsters
of different ages sit apparently waiting for their lessons

Ed looks at one of the waiting boys in a white shirt and bow
tie He is perhaps eleven His hair is greased back in a
Junior Contour

Another boy in a cardigan sweater sports a Butch

The piano piece is ending There is the murmur of voices
Dull footsteps

The studio door swings open

A small man in a rumpled black suit smudged with cigarette
ash is bowing Birdy out the door He has a goatee and a
knotted foulard His eyes flit over the waiting room and
settle on Ed

CARCANOGUES
--You are ze fahzer

high-ceilinged space which is dominated by a grand piano

We are driving through the rural countryside of northern

California

strobes the car through the passing trees

Ed drives

It is a two-lane road with little traffic

Sun

glaring Birdy next to him seems unperturbed
ever cheerful

BIRDY

BIRDY

ED

BIRDY

ED

BIRDY

Ed looks at her

BIRDY

ED
--Uh-huh

BIRDY

ED

He loads a cigarette into his mouth

ED
-I guess Ive been all wet

BIRDY
But I do appreciate it Mr Crane

She reaches over to touch his thigh

BIRDY
--I wanted to make you happy

ED
Birdy--

BIRDY
Its OK

She is leaning over his lap

BIRDY
-l want to do it Mr Crane

Ed is shocked

ED
Birdy

He reaches awkwardly wanting to push her away but not wanting
to be violent

ED
-No please

BIRDY
Please Mr Crane its OK please--

The blare of an oncoming horn

Ed looks up one hand struggling with Birdy the other on
the wheel

The oncoming car

Ed swerves tires screech into a skid Birdy screams
CRASH the car hits a roadside tree

BLACK

ED (VO)
Time slows down right before an
accident and I had time to think
about things I thought about what
an undertaker had told me once--that
your hair keeps growing for a while
anyway after you die

A hubcap is skipping in slow motion along the road and then
off the road down an embankment

ED (VO)
--and then it stops I thought
what keeps it growing Is it like a
plant in soil What goes out of the
soil The soul And when does the
hair realize that its gone

We are high looking down at Ed who is motionless head
resting on the steering wheel of the stopped car We boom
down toward his slowly rotating as we move in As we move
we lose focus Ed becomes more and more blurry

The blurry shape is now slowly spinning away from us a bright
revolving disc spinning up into the darkness until it
disappears leaving only black

FADE IN
Ed sits on the front porch of his bungalow smoking a
cigarette in the late afternoon light

A dog barks next door a distant screen door slams children
are playing somewhere up the street

Ed looks down at his watch It is 530

Something attracts his attention at the foot of his driveway
stands a man in a cream-colored suit and hat He is a small
figure perfectly still staring at the gravel driveway

After a beat he lifts up a small clipboard squints at the
house and jots something down

He finishes writing screws the lid back onto his pen and
is sticking it into a breast pocket when he realizes he is
being watched His manner instantly warms

MAN
Hello

ED
Hello

The man starts up the walk

MAN
I notice you still have peastone in
your driveway

Yeah
MAN
Well of course you dont have to
rejuvenate that once every couple of
years dont you when the peastone
thins out
Ed shrugs

MAN
--Where does it go huh Like the
odd sock But you know where it
goes--you probably pick pieces of it
off your lawn all the time churn it
up with your lawn mower sweep it
off the walk here--pain in the neck

Ed shrugs again
ED
Doesnt bother me

MAN
Well have you ever considered tar
Macadam People think its just for
public works and commercial purposes
roads parking lots so forth

A car pulls into the drive

MAN
--but we have the technology now to
bring it to the homeowner the
individual consumer at a very
reasonable price

Doris emerges from the car

MAN
--Mind if I show you the
specifications--Evening maam

Doris gives him a hard look

DORIS
Whatre you selling

The man gives a practiced laugh

MAN
Well maam I was just telling your
husband here about tar Macadam for
your home driveway here--these are
the specs

Doris takes the brochure he has pulled from a small case

MAN
-Its the modern way to--

Doris tears the brochure in half and hands it back

DORIS
Get lost

The man gazes at her His smile fades fast and he and Doris
stare at each other two hard cases

He turns stiffly and stalks off
Once his gaze has broken Doris turns as well She stalks up
the stairs to the porch and bangs through the screen front
door of the house letting it slam behind her

Quiet early evening

Ed sits smoking

At length he rises and goes in to the house
INT BUNGALOW

It is dim no lights on yet We hear banging and clomping
from the kitchen

Doris emerges with a clinking sound chasing ice cubes around
a drink with a swizzle stick Her face is still hard-set

With a groan of its old upholstery springs she sits onto the
couch

Ed sits as well He draws on his cigarette drags an ashtray
closer on the coffee table

She sips He puffs

ED
Doris-—-

DORIS
Nah dont say anything Im alright

The sit The light is failing The clink of ice cubes
FADE OUT

In the black we hear machine noise of indistinct origin As
the noise becomes more defined we also hear shouting faint
distant

VOICE
Are you there Are you awake

A blurry white disc is fading up As it focuses it resolves
into the reflector worn by a white-robed doctor leaning in
close

He leans away murmuring

DOCTOR
Hes coming around Can you talk
sir These men have to talk
Ed is lying in a hospital bed His face is bandaged and one
side is grotesquely swollen The machine noise is life
support

DOCTOR
-Sir Are you awake Hes awake

Two police officers Persky and Krebs lean in

PERSKY
Are you awake Is he awake

KREBS
Crane We have to tell you as soon
as youre conscious--is he conscious

PERSKY
His eyes are open

KREBS
Uh youre under arrest

PERSKY
As soon as the doctor lets us we
gotta move you Does he understand
that Were supposed to tell him
Are you conscious

KREBS
Youll go to the prison hospital

PERSKY
Under arrest for murder

Eds speech is thickened by injuries and anesthesia

ED
Birdy I didnt mean to--

KREBS
Whatd he say

ED
Birdy

DOCTOR
Birdy The girl No the girls OK

Broken clavicle

The doctor leans in
DOCTOR
Thats the collarbone Crane
Broken Shes OK though

KREBS
So he understands Hes under arrest
for murder

ED
Big Dave

PERSKY
Huh

KREBS

Whatd he say Does he understand

PERSKY
He said OK Is that what he said

Krebs raises his voice

KREBS
Youre under arrest for the murder
of Creighton Tolliver Do you
understand

The voices are fading away

PERSKY
--Does he understand

FADE OUT
UNDERWATER
Light glimmers in water We are drifting down down down

We bring in languidly waving arms--the arms of a child waving
to keep himself submerged It is a ten-year-old boy staring
wide-eyed at something in front of him Bubbles
intermittently stream from his open mouth

ED (VO)
The pansy A kid diving at a waterhole
outside of town had found his car

The reverse shows the car also submerged with Creighton
Tolliver inside also wide-eyed his hairpiece attached at
only one corner the rest of it waving free

ED (VO)
Theyd winched it out

TRACKING
We are tracking laterally across a line of faces seated
men The men rise

ED (VO)
and found hed been beaten
like Big Dave said--beaten to death

just

We arc around a judge entering the chamber through the small

door behind his raised bench

ED (VO)
Inside the briefcase were the

partnership papers Id signed

The judge seats himself and we resume out lateral track on

the jury now reseating itself

ED (VO)

-Showing that Id given him ten
grand For the district attorney

In response to a prompt from the judge the district attorney
rises to read the charge His voice plays distantly muted
the words not discernible under the continuing voice-over

ED (VO)
-that made it fall into place
gotten Doris to steal the money the
pansy had gotten wise somehow and
Id had to kill him to cover my
tracks I was in a spot I called in
Freddy Riedenschneider

Id

Riedenschneider rises into frame at the defense table As he

listens to the charge

ED (VO)
-and signed the house over to him
He said he didnt ordinarily work
that cheap but he figured he owed
me something since the last one hadnt

played out
The drone of the DA has ended and Riedenschneiders echoing
voice drops into the hole

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
Not guilty your honor

ED (VO)
I tried to tell him the whole story
but Riedenschneider stopped me He
said the story made his head hurt
and anyway he didnt see any way of
using it without putting me on the
hot seat for the murder of Big Dave

Riedenschneider claps Ed reassuringly on the shoulder as he
sits next to him Ed still wears a cast on one arm and one
leg

ED (VO)
--He told me not to worry though
said hed think of something Freddy
Riedenschneider wouldnt let me down

JAIL
We are tracking in on Ed lying on the bunk in his cell

ED (VO)
--They put me on twenty-four-hour
deathwatch

A reverse track shows a guard on a tilted-back straightbacked
chair outside the cell door staring at Ed

ED (VO)
-so that I couldnt Cheat Justice
like they said my wife had done

COURTROOM

The district attorney is rising again this time to address
the jury

ED (VO)
---But in front of the jury they had
it that Doris was a saint the whole
plan had been mine I was a Svengali
whod forced Doris to join my criminal
enterprise

The district attorney is pointing at Ed

DISTRICT ATTORNEY
-cynically used his own wife as a
cats paw in a scheme of diabolical
cunning

ED (VO)
On and on it went how Id used Doris
and then let her take the fall That
stuff smarted because some of it was
close to being true

The district attorney seats himself The jurys eyes turn to
Freddy Riedenschneider who studies the tabletop in front of
him either digesting the DAs opening statement or seeking
inspiration for his own

ED (VO)
-And then it was Freddy
Riedenschneiders turn

Riedenschneider rises paces begins to talk

ED (VO)
---I gotta hand it to him he tossed
a lot of sand in their eyes He talked
about how Id lost my place in the

universe

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
-a puny player on the great worlds
stage

ED (VO)

-how I was too ordinary to be the
criminal mastermind the DA made me
out to be how there was some greater
scheme at work that the state had

yet to unravel and he threw in some
of the old truth stuff he hadnt had
a chance to trot out for Doris

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
-who among us is in a position to
say

ED (VO)
--He told them to look at me--look
at me close That the closer they
looked the less sense it would all
make that I wasnt the kind of guy
to kill a guy that I was the barber
for Christs sake

We pan the jury solemnly listening to Riedenschneider
ED (VO)
--I was just like them an ordinary
man guilty of living in a world
that had no place for me guilty of
wanting to be a dry cleaner sure
but not of murder

Riedenschneider is striding energetically into the foreground
to point a finger directly at Eds face

ED (VO)
-He said I was Modern Man and
if they voted to convict me well
theyd be practically cinching the
noose around their own necks He
told them to look not at the facts
but at the meaning of the facts and
then he said the facts had no
meaning It was a pretty good speech
and even had me going

A tap on the shoulder turns Ed around

ED (VO)
--until Frankie interrupted it

Frank socks Ed sending him clattering to the floor

A bailiff immediately restrains him but Frank looms over
Ed bellowing through tears

FRANK
What kind of man are you What
kind of man are you

Riedenschneider interposes his body between Franks and Eds
loudly protesting

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
Move for a mistrial your honor
Move for a mistrial This outrageous
display cannot help but prejudice

Ed moves to get up but Riedenschneider with a sidelong
glance and furtive gesture motions for him to stay on the
floor

RIEDENSCHNEIDER
--and inflame the passions of these
twelve fine men and women
ED (VO)
--Well he got his mistrial but
the well had run dry There was
nothing left to mortgage
Riedenschneider went home and the
court appointed Lloyd Garroway

Ed is now standing next to a distinguished older gentleman
who enters the plea in the new trial

GARROWAY
Your honor we plead guilty with
extenuating circumstances

ED (VO)
--who threw me on the mercy of the
court It was my only chance he
said I guess that meant I never had
a chance

The judge starts droning the sentence

JUDGE
-a menace to society a predator
on his own wife his business
associates on an innocent young
girl social contract line
crossed the offender forfeits the
right to his own life I hereby
order that you be taken to a place
of confinement

PRISON HALLWAY
We are tracking down the hall

ED (VO)
He wasnt buying any of that Modern
Man stuff or the uncertainty stuff
or any of the mercy stuff either
No he was going by the book and
the book said I got the chair

Ed is in the cell at the end of the hall lying on his bunk
hands clasped behind his head

ED (VO)
--Sso here I am At first I didnt
know how I got here I knew step by
step of course which is what Ive
told you step by step but I couldnt
see any pattern

LATER

Ed sits at the little table next to his bunk writing

ED (VO)
--Now that Im near the end Im
glad that this mens magazine paid
me to tell my story Writing it has
helped me sort it all out Theyre
paying five cents a word so youll
pardon me if sometimes Ive told you
more than you wanted to know

Recent issues of the magazine Gent and its sister
publication Nugget lie on the little desk Their lurid covers
depict feature stories like I WAS ABDUCTED BY ALIENS and
AFTER TEN YEARS OF NORMAL LIFE I DISCOVER I AM AN ESCAPED

LUNATIC

ED (VO)
But now all the disconnected
things seems to hook up

Ed sets aside the pen lies down on his bunk and closes his
eyes
ED (VO)
--Thats the funny thing about going
away knowing the date youre gonna
die--and the mens magazine wanted
me to tell how that felt

We hear a pulsing treble hum Ed opens his eyes
The door to his cell is open
He rises and goes through the door

PRISON HALLWAY

Ed alone walks down the hallway The pulsing treble hum is
louder

ED (VO)
Well its like pulling away from
the maze While youre in the maze
you go through willy-nilly turning
where you think you have to turn
banging into dead ends one thing
after another

PRISON YARD

Ed emerges into the empty prison yard ringed by high stone
walls A hard spotlight shines down from above Ed squints
into it

ED (VO)
--But get some distance on it and
all those twists and turns why
theyre the shape of your life Its
hard to explain

The spotlight is from a hovering flying saucer We see its
revolving underside and as it irregularly cants a bit of
its top bubble

After spinning briefly it tips and flies away carrying the
tremolo hum with it

ED (VO)
-But seeing it whole gives you
some peace

Ed turns and re-enters the prison
EDS CELL

Ed is lying on his bunk eyes closed hands clasped behind
his head A hand enters to shake him awake

Three men loom over him two guards and another man wearing
a surplice and holding a bible

ED (VO)
The mens magazine also asked
about remorse Yeah I guess Im
sorry about the pain I caused other
people

PRISON HALLWAY
He is walking the last mile

ED (VO)
--but I dont regret anything Not
a thing I used to I used to regret
being the barber

A door at the end opens
An electric chair Straps open and waiting

ED (VO)
--I dont know where Im being taken

Ed is placed in the chair

ED (VO)

--I dont know what waits for me
beyond the earth and sky But Im
not afraid to go

A man stoops at his feet He has a bucket of water and a
straight razor

He waggles the razor in the water and starts shaving a patch
of Eds calf

ED (VO)
-Maybe the things I dont understand
will be clearer there like when a
fog blows away

Ed watches as the razor makes the trip from his leg to the
bucket of water which begins to spot with small floating
hairs

ED (VO)
-Maybe Doris will be there

They are strapping him in connecting the electrodes

ED (VO)
And maybe there I can tell her

The men withdraw

ED (VO)
--all those things

A thin man in a dark suit and fedora stands by the switch
As he reaches for the switch Ed looks up into the light

ED (VO)
they dont have words for here
