THE LADY IN THE VAN

Written by

Alan Bennett

Based on his memoir
The sound of squealing brakes then a car crash

FADE IN

EXT COUNTRY ROAD DAY 1

A country lane c 1960 with MISS SHEPHERD at the wheel of a
van barrelling along her face set and anxious Distantly we
hear the sound of a police siren (or bell it would be in
1960) She pulls the van into a side road or clearing and
waits ducking behind the seat as she sees the police car
pass the end of the road MISS SHEPHERD rights herself
checks the side of the van Wipes her hand on it Blood She
crosses herself Then starts up the van and drives off the
way she has come

As she turns the corner we see that the police car has
stopped at the end of the road A solitary policeman
UNDERWOOD gets out of the car and watches the van disappear

ROLL TITLES over -

INT CONCERT HALL NIGHT 2

A glamorous pianist in a décolleté evening gown (along the
lines of Anne Todd in The Seventh Veil c 1947) playing
some bravura piano concerto

As the titles end so does the concerto and we hear ALAN
BENNETT in voice over and cut to -

INT 23 GLOUCESTER CRESCENT STUDY DAY 3
ALAN BENNETT at his desk writing
ALAN BENNETT (V0)

The smell is sweet with urine only
a minor component the prevalent
odour suggesting the inside of
someones ear Dank clothes are
there too wet wool and onions
which she eats raw plus what for
me has always been the essence of
poverty damp newspaper

The sound of the lavatory flushing ALAN BENNETT looks
towards the toilet door

THE LADY IN THE VAN - FINAL SCREENPLAY 2

ALAN BENNETT (VO)(CONTD)
Miss Shepherds multi-flavoured

aroma is masked by a liberal
application of various talcum
powders with Yardleys Lavender
always a favourite and currently

it is this genteel fragrance that
dominates the second subject as

it were in her odoriferous

concerto

MISS SHEPHERD comes out of the lavatory pulls down her
skirt and leaves through the front door We see something of
the inside of the house and its contents still at this date
c 1976 fairly uncluttered

ALAN BENNETT (VO)

But as she goes the original theme
returns her own primary odour now
triumphantly restated and left
hanging in the house long after she
has departed

Out of the window we see Miss Shepherds van parked in the
drive and MISS SHEPHERD herself rearranges some plastic bags
beneath the van She is tall and though her changes of
costume will not be described in detail she is generally
dressed in an assortment of coats and headscarves but with a
variety of other hats superimposed on the headscarves Old
raincoats figure as do carpet slippers and skirts which have
often been lengthened by the simple process of sewing on
additional strips of material She is about sixty-five

ALAN BENNETT
(at the desk speaks)
Tell her

As he watches through the window AB - his other self -
comes out of the house

EXT 23 GLOUCESTER CRESCENT DAY 46
AB approaches the van

AB
(at the van)
Miss Shepherd In future I would
prefer it if you didnt use my
lavatory There are lavatories at
the bottom of the High Street Use
those

MISS SHEPHERD
They smell I’m by nature a very
clean person

MISS SHEPHERD (CONT D)
I have a testimonial for a Clean
Room awarded me some years ago

spotless said I was the cleanest of
my mother’s children

(AB gives up and goes)

particularly in the unseen places

INT 23 GLOUCESTER CRESCENT STUDY DAY 7
AB catches ALAN BENNETTS eye as he passes the study door

ALAN BENNETT (VO)
The writer is double There is the
self who does the writing and there
is the self who does the living
And they talk They argue Writing
is talking to one’s self and Ive
been doing it all my life and long
before I first saw this house five
years ago

Five years earlier possibly with a subtitle though the
unkempt nature of the house and a ‘For Sale’ sign indicates
that this is earlier House empty No van

Gloucester Crescent and then into the garden with an ESTATE
AGENT

AB

ESTATE AGENT (CONT’D)

Good street On the up and up

AB and the ESTATE AGENT walk up Gloucester Crescent The
street is alive with refurbishing activity As he speaks
workmen bring out a nice marble fireplace out of No 63 and
shove it in the skip breaking it in the process More
workmen carry materials into another house

MISS SHEPHERD
Well if youre not St John I need

AB
Was it distilled water

MISS SHEPHERD
It was holy water so it doesnt
matter if it was distilled or not
The oil is another possibility

THE LADY IN THE VAN - FINAL SCREENPLAY 5

AB
Thats not holy too

MISS SHEPHERD
Holy oil in a van It would be far
too expensive I want pushing round

DOCTOR
This is a woman who has broken her

and sails down the middle of the street the expression on
her face the nearest its ever been to pleasure or indeed
rapture Its a real joy ride with AB rather alarmed
running behind her

When the chair has slowed down she stops it by slurring her
slippered feet and when it stops she waves her stick in
triumph

It should be a triumphant scene with lots of music

single-handed for all these years
you dont understandably resent
it when the professionals lend a
hand

professionals turn up every three
months or so and try to tell me
what this woman whom I have coped
with on a daily basis for the past
fifteen years is like

MISS BRISCOE
What is she like

AB
Mary as you call her is a
bigoted blinkered cantankerous
devious unforgiving self-serving
rank rude car-mad cow Which is
to say nothing of her flying faeces
and her ability to extrude from her
withered buttocks turds of such
force that they land a yard from
the back of the van and their
presumed point of exit

Beat ALAN BENNETT is at the desk

ALAN BENNETT

MISS SHEPHERD
(who materialises behind
him)
Mr Bennett excuse me Im supposed
to be the centrepiece here

ALAN BENNETT (VO)
But I’m forgetting that the dead
know everything

MISS SHEPHERD
You should be fighting back the
tears not eyeing up the talent

AB turns startled to ALAN BENNETT who is beside him

ALAN BENNETT

No

MISS SHEPHERD walks away from the grave the other two

MISS SHEPHERD
Ive been wondering Would either
of you object if the van were to
become a place of pilgrimage

ALAN BENNETT
No

AB
Im getting rid of the van The van
is going

MISS SHEPHERD
Healing could take place and any
proceeds could go towards the nuns

AB
The nuns What did the nuns ever do
for you

MISS SHEPHERD
Well not much but when the
donations start rolling in theyll
realise what a catch I would have
been It was the same with St
Bernadette They didn’t realise
with her until it was too late
This way Theres someone I want
you to meet

MISS SHEPHERD turns off the path looking for someone They
follow

MISS SHEPHERD (CONT’D)
(To ALAN BENNETT)

Thats something you could do This
thing you’re trying to write you
could pump it up a bit If it were
along the lines of The Song of
Bernadette it would make you a
packet

ALAN BENNETT looks unconvinced

MISS SHEPHERD (CONT ’D)
Why do you just let me die Id
like to go up into heaven An
ascension possibly A
transfiguration

no such thing as marking time and
that time marks you In

AB opens a box containing copies of the first LRB paperback
edition of The Lady In The Van

AB
You wanted me to make things happen
and I never have much But it
doesnt matter because what Ive
learned - and maybe she taught me -
is that you dont put yourself into
what you write You find yourself
there

ALAN BENNETT
I never wanted to write about her
And if thered been a bit more in
your life I wouldnt have had to

AB
Maybe I will now

The sound of the key in the front door which bangs shut A
voice calls Hi

ALAN BENNETT
What

AB
Have a bit more in my life I might
even start living

AB looks towards the MAN who now comes through the study
door and greets him and who seems quite at home

AB (CONTD)
Good day

MAN
Not bad You

AB shrugs and the ATTRACTIVE MAN puts his hand on his
shoulder and leaves it there
He goes towards the kitchen stairs

MAN (CONTD)
You coming down

stop talking to yourself

AB looks back at the desk and the chair is empty AB
smiles and follows ATTRACTIVE MAN downstairs
