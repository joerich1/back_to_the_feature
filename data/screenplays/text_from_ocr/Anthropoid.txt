NOTE The Czech language is a completely different language from
German Within this film the Czech language is presented as English
(possibly with a Czech accent) German will remain German and will not
be subtitled Most Czechs did not speak German so the Germans either

used basic Czech words and phrases or enlisted an interpreter

BLACK SCREEN The sound of silk ripping tree branches
snapping and then a thud

OPEN ON

EXT PINE FOREST HILLS - NIGHT 1

A man with his back to the camera A harness hangs from his
back A frantic reeling action with his arms as he gathers in
a silk parachute The action JUMP CUTS as he buries the chute
into the snow

This is JAN KUBIS 29 Strong slender frame

JAN stands up into frame his back still to the CAMERA
SOUND OFF A muffled scream JAN turns his head to where the
sound came from and listens He tries to control his fast
breaths the moonlit backlights the vapour against the dark
forest

He looks sensitive but determined A thinking man

The forest silent except for his own breathing The sound
again JAN takes off in its direction

Various fast paced TRACKING shots until JAN stops ina
clearing and sees

JOSEF GABCIK 30 Volatile and demonstrative in equal
measures

Part of JOSEF’s parachute has snagged on a pine tree He is
attempting to pull it down and is unsteady on his feet He is
grimacing in pain JAN arrives and they pull the parachute
free and start to bury it

JOSEF
Where is the equipment

JOSEF turns and indicates behind them
JAN turns and sees a parachute caught impossibly high up ina
pine tree A metal container gently dangles below the
entanglement
JAN
(under his breath)
Kurva

JAN looks back and sees that JOSEF is limping on one foot

ANTHROPOID V20 1
JAN
What happened

JOSEF
Caught one of the branches on the
way down

JAN

Can you move

EXT FOREST TRACK - NIGHT 2
JAN’s arms are around JOSEF as he helps him along a snowy
track over-shadowed by trees CAMERA follows them from
behind

CLOSE UP Two pairs of feet hurrying through the snow One
pair badly limping and leaving a deep red blood trail through
white snow

CUT TO BLACK

TITLE —- WHITE ON BLACK 3

ANTHROPOID

INT FOREST CAVE - NIGHT 4
A small fire JAN eats some rations

JOSEF removes his boot His sock is sticky with dark blood
He pulls down the sock to reveal a deep cut on his ankle

JAN inspects the wound

JAN
Youll need stitches

JAN rips a rag from his pack and helps JOSEF dress the wound

JAN then sees a small piece of wood on the cave floor He
picks it up and inspects it He takes his knife from his
belt sits with his back to the cave wall and starts to
whittle the wood with his knife

INT FOREST CAVE - EARLY MORNING 5

The fire has smouldered into grey ash The two men are
asleep

There’s a noise JAN opens his eyes and sees at the mouth of
the cave a figure This is ANTONIN a middle-aged stocky
farmer brutish in manner holding a shotgun with a dog at
his feet JAN wakens JOSEF There’s a momentary silence as
the three eye each other

ANTHROPOID V20 2
ANTONIN
You didn’t hide your parachutes
very well and you left a blood
trail for half a kilometer

Silence Nobody moves

ANTONIN
Follow me I live not far from
here

JOSEF and JAN get to their feet groggily

EXT OPEN LAND - EARLY MORNING 6

A snow-covered landscape In the middle distance is ANTONIN
who turns and urges them to keep up

JOSEF and JAN exchange apprehensive glances
A clearing in the woods JAN scans and sees

A small farmhouse with a barn Pens for livestock a truck
sits parked next to a stone well Self sufficient

ANTONIN
Ignac
(beat)
IGNAC

A few moments later IGNAC appears in the doorway of the
farmhouse A tousle-haired youth in his late teens with an
acned face IGNAC has on an leather apron stained with blood
He has a carving belt with a number of knives held in place

ANTONIN
Prepare some food

IGNAC turns and runs back inside
ANTONIN
Hot soup Come
INT FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 7

Some nasty soup is poured into bowls IGNAC places the bowls
in front of JAN and JOSEF

JAN shares a concerned look with JOSEF The farmhouse looks
run down and in need of repair

ANTONIN
Please eat

JAN and JOSEF slowly lift the spoons to their mouths The
scene awkward

ANTHROPOID V20 3
ANTONIN
I take it you are heading for
Prague

JOSEF
Yes How far away is it

ANTONIN
30 Kilometers I have a special
delivery permit for my truck
(beat)
I could take you

JAN looks at JOSEF and then at ANTONIN

JAN
(appreciative)
Thank you

ANTONIN
Well that’s settled You rest here
tonight and I will take you in the
morning

ANTONIN exchanges a look with IGNAC and then stands up from
the table

ANTONIN
Enjoy your soup

ANTONIN leaves the room closing the door behind him JAN and
JOSEF are left with IGNAC who looks like he never went to
school

JOSEF looks at JAN Something is wrong The silence in the
room oppressive A clock gently ticks somewhere

JOSEF suddenly stands up and strides towards the kitchen door
and bursts through into the hall to find ANTONIN standing in
the hallway on the telephone

JOSEF steps forward takes a pistol from his pocket and aims
it at ANTONIN’s head

ANTONIN like a rabbit caught in the headlights slowly puts
the phone down and raises his hands in the air

JOSEF
How much do you get for turning in
parachutists to the Germans
ANTONIN just stares at him Guilt written on his face
JOSEF grabs ANTONIN and pulls him back to the kitchen where
he finds JAN seated with his hands in the air and IGNAC
holding a knife to his throat

IGNAC
Drop the gun

ANTHROPOID V20 4
JOSEF keeps the gun aimed at ANTONIN’s head IGNAC reaches
inside JAN’s jacket and takes his gun

IGNAC
I said drop the

SUDDENLY ANTONIN grabs the gun and he and JOSEF wrestle for
control

JAN grabs IGNAC’s arm and kicks back and the two fly
backwards and are stopped by the sink

IGNAC drops the knife and the gun - JAN drops for the gun but
IGNAC kicks it and skittles across the dank floor IGNAC
steps back and pulls another knife from his belt

ANTONIN is stronger and manages to pull the gun away from
JOSEF But in doing so pulls the trigger shooting himself
in the face

Blood sprays across JOSEF’s stunned face
Everyone is momentarily frozen in shock

IGNAC looks at ANTONIN who is face down He suddenly realises
he is now outnumbered He turns and bolts out of a side door
in the kitchen

JOSEF scuttles next to ANTONIN and retrieves his pistol from
ANTONIN’s dead hand JOSEF spins and throws the pistol
through the air towards JAN

JAN catches it and chases after IGNAC

At the edge of the forest JAN stops running and aims the
pistol An expression of concentration His stance trained
like that of a soldier

JANs POV a clear shot of IGNAC as he runs deeper into the
forest

JAN’s concentration turns to hesitation The hand that holds
the gun starts to shake More than hesitation - a mental
block JAN is hyperventilating Pain across his face Sweat
pours JAN wipes his face and re-aims

JANs POV IGNAC disappears into the thick cover of the
forest

JAN drops to his knees fighting for breath Full-on panic
attack Fists clenched muscles cramping

JAN fights it Tries to calm himself Slowly gets up turns
and makes his way back to the farmhouse

ANTHROPOID V20 5
INTEXT FARMHOUSE - DAY 8

JOSEF pulls the phone line from the wall Takes a cloth and
regards the dead weight of ANTONIN’s body on the kitchen
floor A pool of black blood slowly creeping across the
floor Josef wipes the blood from his face and exits

JAN approaching More in control

JOSEF
You get him

JAN shakes his head no JOSEF looks at JAN for a beat -
JOSEF’s thoughts unreadable He breaks off to survey the
area

JOSEF

(nodding towards it)
Well take their truck

INT TRUCK - DAY 9

JAN drives JOSEF looks out the window at the passing
landscape

JAN steals a look at JOSEF JOSEF notices

JOSEF
What
(beat)
They had made their choice
(beat)
Sometimes you have to pick a side
(beat)

You would prefer it was us
JAN looks back to the road The question hangs in the air

JOSEF tears some cloth from a spare shirt and puts his foot
on the dash He changes the blood soaked rag for the new
cloth and ties it tight

JAN
(indicating Josefs foot)
We have to get that looked at as
soon as possible

JOSEF
We have to make contact with the
address in Prague first
(beat)
Well deal with this after
JAN gives him a worried look and then looks back at the road

A squealing sound is heard over the engine JOSEF turns
lifts the canvas and peers into the back of the truck

Six or seven pigs are in the back of the truck

ANTHROPOID V20 6

JAN
What is it

JOSEF
A truck full of pigs

JOSEF sits back and for the first time the men share a smile
at the situation they find themselves in

EXT COUNTRY LANE - DAY 10

The truck speeds past a sign post that indicates Prague is 28
Kilometers away

OMITTED 11

OMITTED 12

OMITTED 13

EXT PRAGUE STREETS - DAY 14

Various shots as the truck makes its way through the streets
of Prague

INT TRUCK - DAY 15
JOSEF checks his map and then the road ahead

JOSEF
Should be the next left

Through the windows we see the heavy presence of the German
army Military trucks and soldiers very much in evidence at
every street corner

JAN turns the wheel and makes a left turn

JOSEF
Pull over here

The truck comes to a stop as JOSEF looks up at an apartment
block

JOSEF
This is it

JAN and JOSEF exit the truck

EXT PRAGUE STREET - DAY 16

They both check the street with nervous glances

ANTHROPOID V20 7

INT APARTMENT BLOCK STEPS - DAY 17

JAN and JOSEF climbs the steps until they see a blue door
with the number 44 on it

They have a quick look around and then nod to one another

JAN knocks on the door and they wait Footsteps are heard and
then the door opens

A plain looking WOMAN in her late thirties appears and looks
at JAN and JOSEF

WOMAN
Yes

JAN
We are looking for Oldrich Novak

The woman looks at them Uncertainty in her eyes

WOMAN
The Novakovi no longer live here

A silent beat

JAN
You have their new address

The WOMAN looks down and sees that JOSEF’s foot is bleeding
and leaving a small pool of blood around his heal

WOMAN
I heard they were taken by the
Gestapo a month before we moved
into the apartment

From inside the apartment a MAN’s voice calls out

MAN (0S)
Who is it

WOMAN
(turning inside briefly)
Don’t worry father Just someone
looking for directions
(back to Jan and Josef)
I’m sorry that is all I know

JAN
(stopping the door from
closing)
Please can you help us

WOMAN
My father is not well you must
leave

JAN steps back from the door and JOSEF stares at the WOMAN

ANTHROPOID V20 8

The WOMAN locks eyes with JOSEF A brief second passes

WOMAN
There is a veterinarian in the next
row of shops up the street
(beat)
I hear he is a good man
(beat)
One that may help

JOSEF nods his thanks and they leave

INT VETERINARIAN’S SURGERY - DAY 18

A small French bulldog is being held by an ELDERLY WOMAN
while DR EDUARD mid-50s bookish but kind is trying to
examine the dog

The dog is barking and trying to bite DR EDUARD

ELDERLY WOMAN
He normally only barks at Germans

DR EDUARD
Germans and anyone giving him a
rectal examination

DR EDUARD removes his gloved hand from the dog’s rear and
takes off the glove

DR EDUARD
He should be fine now but don’t let
him eat the rubbish around the bins
again

From next door we hear the bell above the front door sound
DR EDUARD looks up with slight concern - he is not expecting
any other clients today He reassures the ELDERLY LADY with a
warm smile

INT VETERINARIAN’S RECEPTION - DAY 19

Frosted glass panels sit on top on wood panels and separate
the reception from the surgery with a door in the centre

ELDERLY WOMAN
(leading the dog out of
the surgery)
Thank you Dr Eduard Come along
Benés

In the shop the ELDERLY WOMAN stops to see JAN and JOSEF in
the waiting area - neither have any pets

The ELDERLY WOMAN looks back at DR EDUARD with a slightly
worried expression

DR EDUARD
Look after him Mrs Spinka

ANTHROPOID V20 9

MRS SPINKA leaves and DR EDUARD turns to JAN and JOSEF A
brief pause before we cut to

INT VETERINARIAN’S SURGERY - DAY 20

A close up of JOSEF’s foot A spot lamp lights a large cut
that is being stitched together by DR EDUARD Dark sticky
blood surrounds the deep cut and five stitches hold most of
the wound together

DR EDUARD looks over his glasses at JAN who is peeking out
through the curtains

JAN’s POV Three German soldiers are roughly herding a Jewish
family along the streets Prodding them shouting at them

JAN walks back from the window and looks to JOSEF and then to
DR EDUARD

DR EDUARD
Normally for a dog bite you would
go to a hospital not a vet

JAN
Did you know Oldrich Novak

DR EDUARD looks up to JAN and notices JAN’s right hand is
stuffed into coat pocket and is obviously holding a pistol

DR EDUARD looks back and continues to stitch JOSEF’s wound

DR EDUARD
Yes He and his family were taken
by the Gestapo

JAN
You know why

DR EDUARD
They were suspected of anti-Nazi
activities

JAN
And what if we were to say Oldrich
Novak was our contact here in
Prague

A beat

DR EDUARD
Then I would have to wonder if you
were ill informed Czech patriots or
Gestapo spies trying to infiltrate
what remains of the resistance

Silence DR EDUARD looks at JAN’s bag on the floor Inside we
can partly make out what looks like a decoder paper

ANTHROPOID V20 10
DR EDUARD
You sound Czech I detect no German
accent Neither of you seem to have
been beaten into coercion You seem
more concerned by the threat
outside this room The decoding
paper in your bag doesn’t have a
German font and given that this
wound has more tree bark in it than
dog bite I would have to guess you
have been parachuted back into
Czechoslovakia with intelligence
that is somewhat out of date

JOSEF winces as the last stitch is finished

JAN
Youre a clever man
(beat)
We were also told you were a good
man

DR EDUARD stands and wipes his hands

DR EDUARD
(holds out his hand)
You have papers

JAN takes a wallet and removes his papers JAN hands them
over to DR EDUARD

An official looking document with JAN’s photograph attached

DR EDUARD
(inspecting the papers)
Where were these made

JAN
London why what’s wrong

DR EDUARD
(impressed face)
Nothing They’re good

He hands them back as a volley of shots is heard outside
JAN starts to go to the window
DR EDUARD stops him

DR EDUARD

Don’t You could draw attention

(beat)
There is nothing we can do You
will get used to it

(beat)
I’m not sure how long you have been
away or what London has told you
about what is going on here

ANTHROPOID V20 11
JOSEF
I think our current situation
answers that no

DR EDUARD
Quite

We left for the defence of France
and were evacuated to England when
France fell to the Germans

(beat)
It’s been a while

DR EDUARD

Since Reinhard Heydrich was
appointed Reich Protektor of the
Czech lands fear and suspicion
rule Rewards are given to people
who inform on anti-Nazi activity
Handsome rewards

(beat
Heydrich has all but nearly crushed
the resistance and has executed
thousands of Czech nationals

(beat)
Everyone is scared

DR EDUARD puts the final bandages on JOSEF’s foot

JOSEF
And you

DR EDUARD

I’m just a vet You didn’t give me
much choice

(beat)
I can put you in contact with the
Miller Maybe he can help you

(beat)
If you can convince him

(beat)
You can stay here tonight and I’1l1
contact the Miller in the morning

JOSEF
My friend here said you were a
clever man I agree
(indicates his hand in his
pocket)
Don’t do anything that would change
our opinion

DR EDUARD nods to the men and then indicates JOSEF’s leg
DR EDUARD
Go easy on the foot and you should

be dancing the tango within the
week

ANTHROPOID V20 12

EXT PRAGUE PANORAMIC SHOT - DAWN 21

Over the rooftops All is now quiet The city starts to stir

INT VETERINARIAN’S SURGERY - MORNING 22

JAN and JOSEF are ready and waiting They look like they
havent slept JOSEF is checking the street from the window
and JAN is whittling his piece of wood when the sound of keys
are heard unlocking the front door

JAN opens the surgery door a crack and sees DR EDUARD enter
with another man He is BRETISLAV BAUMAN a tall slim man in
his early fifties educated but with a brusque manner He is
a local miller but carries himself with the confidence of
something more His hand deep in his coat pocket proves it

DR EDUARD stops when he sees JAN and JOSEF in defensive
positions by the surgery door

DR EDUARD
This is Bretislav the miller

BRETISLAV looks at JAN and JOSEF A pause as they size each
other up

BRETISLAV
Eduard told me you were looking for
Oldrich Novak

JOSEF looks at BRETISLAV and nods

BRETISLAV
Would you like to take a drive with
me

Awkward pause Nervous looks

INT TRUCK - MORNING 23

BRETISLAV drives with JAN and JOSEF on the bench seat next to
him

A three-storey concrete building put up in the 1920s looms
through the windshield Cold and functional The truck
approaches and stops outside the entrance

JOSEF
Where are all the students

BRETISLAV

Closed

(beat)
Germans don’t like colleges They
encourage people to think

(beat)
Most of the academics and
intellectuals have been shot

ANTHROPOID V20 13

BRETISLAV gets out the truck and starts walking across the
courtyard and towards the school building

JAN
What do you think

JOSEF
I think stay on your toes
EXT SCHOOL BUILDING - DAY 24
JAN and JOSEF get out the truck and cross a courtyard and
join BRETISLAV as they all enter through the main large
doors
INT SCHOOL BUILDING CORRIDOR - DAY 25

JAN JOSEF and BRETISLAV walk down a long corridor their
footsteps echo

JOSEF looks around empty class rooms Some with chairs over
turned Paint peeling from the walls Rust marks Decay It
doesn’t look good

JOSEF limps along and snatches a look at JAN Both have a
hand in their pocket

The corridor is long Their footsteps echo out Tensions at
breaking point

BRETISLAV looks back over his shoulder at JOSEF JOSEF meets
his gaze BRETISLAV turns back and reaches a doorway goes
through it JAN and JOSEF follow

INT SCHOOL BUILDING CLASSROOM - DAY 26

Sitting behind a desk is a man Standing next to him is
another man

JAN and JOSEF enter but don’t see the two men either side of
the door they came through

“CLICK” Pistols are trained on the back of JAN’s and JOSEF’s
head

BRETISLAV spins pistol trained on JAN and JOSEF

BRETISLAV
Don’t move

JAN and JOSEF look around to assess the situation Two armed
men behind BRETISLAV in front Two men at the desk in front

BRETISLAV takes the pistols from JAN and JOSEF’s pockets

JOSEF looks very angry at himself for walking right into a
trap

ANTHROPOID V20 14
BRETISLAV places the pistols on the desk in front of the
seated man He is JAN ZELENKA a teacher code-named ‘UNCLE
HAJSKY’ an intellectual looking man in his early fifties

Standing next to him is a tall slim man in his mid-forties
with a determined manner He is LADISLAV VANEK

The men from behind place two chairs in front of the desk and
recede to cover at the back of the room

LADISLAV
(hand outstretched)
Please sit

The room is silent

JADISLAV
You were looking for Oldrich Novak
JOSEF nods
JADISLAV
Why

JOSEF looks at them for what seems a long time Weighing the
situation the words he must use

JOSEF
He was our contact here in Prague

It hangs in the air

LADISLAV
Who gave you this contact

JOSEF
London

BRETISLAV and LADISLAV exchange looks

LADISLAV
And you tell us this because

JAN
You are not leaving us much choice
and this doesn’t look like Gestapo
headquarters

LADISLAV turns to look at JAN

LADISLAV
You where are you from
(beat)
Your accent Bohemia

JAN
No from Dolni Vilemovice Moravia

LADISLAV

Then you must know the railway
station at Vladislav

ANTHROPOID V20 15
JAN
Yes

LADISLAV
What’s so special about it

JAN thinks for a moment

JAN
I presume you are talking about the
large bed of coloured roses that
when seen from above is in the
shape of our national flag

The men regard each other for a pregnant beat

JAN
Is it still there

LADISLAV
Seems the Germans have still not
looked at it from above

LADISLAV smiles He pulls up a chair Sits

LADISLAV

I am Vanek Ladislav Vanek

(beat)
I’m the head of the Jindra
organization

(beat)
Czech resistance

(beat)
This is Jan Zelenka code name
Uncle Hajsky

JAN
I am Jan Kubis

JOSEF
I am Josef Gabcik From Slovakia

UNCLE HAJSKY
You mustn’t be surprised by our
lack of trust The Gestapo have
been very successful in
infiltrating our network

(beat)

The contact that London gave you
Oldrich Novak He was taken away
some months ago

JOSEF
Well that could have got us
killed why wasn’t London informed

LADISLAV
We lost contact with the Czech
government-in-exile in London some
months ago We need replacement
crystals for the transmitter
(MORE)

ANTHROPOID V20
LADISLAV (CONTD)
We’ve been waiting for them to send
someone to reestablish contact
(beat)
Is that you

JOSEF
There were other men on our plane
They were dropped elsewhere it’s
possible they have orders to
reestablish contact with London but
I’m afraid that is not our mission

UNCLE HAJSKY
What is your mission

A long beat as JOSEF regards JAN

JOSEF
We are here as Operation
Anthropoid

UNCLE HAJSKY
Derived from the Greek Anthropos
It means resembling a human being
in form

JOSEF
We don’t know what it means other
than the instructions given within
the code name

There is a long silence in the room

LADISLAV
I take it you want our help for
this mission
(beat)
Whatever it is

JAN
Yes We will need your help

Another silence

LADISLAV
We can help of course But we need
to know what you need help with
(beat)
What is Anthropoid

JAN and JOSEF seem to be struggling with the information they
possess

LADISLAV tilts his head curiously at their struggle

UNCLE HAJSKY looks at LADISLAV and then back at JAN and
JOSEF It’s dawning on them just how big this mission could
be

ANTHROPOID V20 17
JOSEF
We are here to assassinate SS
Obergruppenfiihrer Reinhard
Heydrich

UNCLE HAJSKY and LADISLAV are frozen for a second Blank
faces just staring back

JOSEF
The Reichsprotektor of Bohemia and -

UNCLE HAJSKY LADISLAV
(interrupting) (overlapping)
Yes we know who he is Are you completely mad
JOSEF LADISLAV
We have our orders comrades But this is madness
Heydrich For Christ sakes
man

UNCLE HAJSKY
(trying to interrupt)
Ladislav

LADISLAV
Why stop with Heydrich Why not
have a go at Hitler as well He’s
only 300 kilometers down the road
in a small village called Berlin

JOSEF
So we report to London that you are
refusing to cooperate with our
mission

LADISLAV loses it and kicks back his chair as he leaps to a
confrontational stance in front of JOSEF JOSEF springs up
and stands his ground

LADISLAV
How dare you question us
(beat)
You know what we have sacrificed
for the cause here

The men behind re-train their weapons at JOSEF
Silence as the men regard each other in the stand off
UNCLE HAJSKY

(calmly)

Ladislav please Sit down

LADISLAV breaks the stare and returns to his seat as does
JOSEF

LADISLAV
You kill Heydrich and Hitler will
tear Prague apart

(MORE )

ANTHROPOID V20 18
LADISLAV (CONTD)

I’m talking about the sort of
reprisals we don’t want to imagine
can’t imagine

(beat)
They will find a weak link exploit
it Until someone gives them a
name Anyone that so much as sold a
newspaper to that name will be
shot

(beat)
I take it you have family in
Czechoslovakia Mother Father

(beat)
You kill Heydrich then you can
consider them and everyone that
ever knew you dead

JOSEF
All Czech patriots should be ready
to die for their country That
includes my family

LADISLAV

(overlap)
Well I’m not I want to carry on
fighting We don’t have that many
left that are willing to do that
We are what’s left of the Czech
resistance We die it dies

(beat)
I suggest a lesser rank should be
assassinated Perhaps a few of
them

(beat)
We could look at Karl Frank or any
of the puppets in the government
here that collaborate with the
Nazis

JAN
Heydrich is the head of the secret
police Only Hitler and Himmler are
above him in the Nazi hierarchy

LADISLAV
Exactly my point you really think
youll ever get close enough to
assassinate Heydrich

Doubt

JOSEF
Our orders have come direct from
the Czech Government in London

LADISLAV
So this is about the Czech
government in London trying to
impress the allies

(beat)

What about when we had an army
Were willing to fight

(MORE)

ANTHROPOID V20

LADISLAV (CONTD)

Able to fight

(beat)
It was the allies that gave us to
the Germans in the first place

(beat)
Am I the only one that remembers
the Munich agreement

UNCLE HAJSKY
Munich was a betrayal but it’s
also now history The question the
Czech Government in exile seems to
be asking is this are we still
able to fight Is Czechoslovakia
still ready and able to resist Nazi
Germany

JOSEF
The assassination of Reinhard
Heydrich couldn’t send a clearer
message to the world

LADISLAV
Yes but at what cost

There is a heavy silence in the room

UNCLE HAJSKY

You have your orders

(beat)
I’m sure Ladislav’s feelings will
not colour his support

(beat)
What do you need from us in the
meantime

JOSEF
Everything you know on Heydrich

UNCLE HAJSKY
I presume you want this down to the
fine details of movements planned
engagements and so on

JOSEF and JAN nod

UNCLE HAJSKY
It will take us a couple of weeks
to figure out who we have on the
inside that can get close to that
kind of information

JOSEF
There is one other thing
(beat)
We lost our equipment in the drop

LADISLAV
What do you need

ANTHROPOID V20

JOSEF
Two anti-tank grenades model 73
32 pounds of plastic explosives
two magazines of fuses three
timing pencils and one Sten Mark II
machine gun with 100 rounds

LADISLAV
And where am I supposed to find all
that

JOSEF

Hanging thirty meters up froma
pine tree we can show you
approximately where on a map

UNCLE HAJSKY
In the meantime I will take you to
one of the safe houses we have in
Prague

JAN and JOSEF understand with a grateful nod

UNCLE HAJSKY (CONTD)
I will speak to our vet the good
Dr Eduard and see if he can get you
medical certificates stating you
are exempt from work

We use the code of three knocks
followed by one knock

An open window with the curtain
drawn is the danger signal Stay
away at all costs

Lay low until I can send word
through Ata

The men nod
UNCLE HAJSKY bows to MRS MORAVEC and leaves

The men make a courtesy smile to MRS MORAVEC and then go
about their business They are checking every part of the
flat the windows the locks and so on

MRS MORAVEC looks on slightly anguished as she watches them
systematically check everything

JOSEF
(pointing at the front
door)
That’s the only way in and out

MRS MORAVEC nods hands held across her front

JOSEF
And the room we sleep in

MRS MORAVEC shows JAN and JOSEF to a little box room off the
corridor A simple room Two mattress beds on the floor A
table and chair A dresser and in an alcove a sink with a
mirror above

JAN
JOSEF

JOSEF looks at JAN who has seen a skylight in the ceiling

JOSEF
(to Mrs Moravec)
There’s a way off the roof

MRS MORAVEC
(thinks)
There is a fire escape to the left
To the right it continues to the
building next door

JAN
That’s good enough

JOSEF takes a chair and brings it to the door and wedges it
under the handle

ANTHROPOID V20 23
JAN takes a tray of china from the table and lifts the table
placing it under the skylight He jumps on the table and
easily opens the skylight and looks out He then pokes his
head back in and gives a nod

JOSEF
OK The chair stays by the door and
the side table must always be clear
of any china

MRS MORAVEC nods

MRS MORAVEC
(slightly nervous)
I am sure you both would like a
glass of Becherovka

JAN
Becherovka Thank you

The front door is heard opening and JAN and JOSEF instantly
pull out their pistols

A female voice from the hallway

FEMALE VOICE
Mrs Moravec

MRS MORAVEC
It’s OK It’s Marie

MRS MORAVEC takes the chair from under the door handle
JAN and JOSEF hide their pistols

MRS MORAVEC opens the door and they exit to meet MARIE
Kovarnikova in the hallway MARIE is an attractive girl in
her late teens bearing two heavy shopping bags She freezes
in slight shock at the two strangers behind MRS MORAVEC

MRS MORAVEC
It’s OK Marie This is Jan and
Josef my cousins from the country
They will be staying with us while
they are looking for work

JOSEF
(formal)
Pleased to meet you Marie
JOSEF extends his hand

Somewhat shyly MARIE puts down the shopping bag and leans
over to shake JOSEF’s hand

JAN smiles as he shakes her hand

JAN
Hello

ANTHROPOID V20 24

There is a play between their eyes and its obvious that there
is an attraction on JAN’s part

JOSEF notices

MRS MORAVEC
Marie Josef and Jan are not
registered with the police as being
residents here so remember please
keep it strictly to yourself

MARIE
(nods )
I‘1l put the shopping in the
kitchen then

MRS MORAVEC smiles warmly at MARIE as she takes the shopping
bags into the kitchen to unpack

JOSEF looks at MARIE leaving and then at MRS MORAVEC He
looks concerned

MRS MORAVEC

Don’t worry she is a trustworthy
girl Mrs Kovarnikova’s daughter I
pay her for helping out

(beat)
I have to I get no help from Ata
always on the violin And as for Mr
Moravec he thinks he’s helping out
if he closes a door

(beat)
Dinner will be at 6pm

INT MORAVEC FLAT MAIN ROOM - NIGHT 31
JAN and JOSEF help lay plates onto the dinner table
MARIE helps MRS MORAVEC in the kitchen
MRS MORAVEC’s husband MR (Alois) MORAVEC is a large
overweight man in his late forties with bushy eyebrows and a
bluff manner He sits in a chair off to the side reading his
newspaper
ATA can be heard in the background playing the violin
Christmas decorations lightly decorate the apartment
The hot dishes are brought into the dining room
A modest feast is ready
MRS MORAVEC
(calling out into the
hall)

Ata Dinner is ready

MR MORAVEC gets out the chair and makes his way to the head
of the table

ANTHROPOID V20 25
MARIE
Well I’ll be off now Mrs Moravec

MRS MORAVEC
Don’t be silly Marie Please stay
and eat with us We have enough

JAN steals a glance at MARIE who looks away

MRS MORAVEC
Marie I insist

MARIE
OK then Thank you

MARIE takes a seat opposite JAN ATA enters the dining room
and sits down

MR MORAVEC
(sighing)
And finally the fiddler is silent

MRS MORAVEC
(to Mr Moravec)
He’s a violinist Alois A
violinist

MR MORAVEC
Well whatever it is and it
wouldn’t be so bad if he played
something everyone knew

MRS MORAVEC
(proudly to Jan and Josef)
Ata is at the Conservatory for
gifted musicians

MR MORAVEC
Wasn’t interested in the railways
was he Could be earning good money
now as a clerk I saw a future for
him as a station master

(beat)

Still I suppose the lad has to
follow his own path

ATA has his face over his plate and is too busy eating to
hear this old rant again

MR MORAVEC
(to Jan and Josef)
You two boys looking for work then

JAN
(swallowing his food)
Mmmm Yes

MR MORAVEC
Were always looking for boys in
the railway shed to clean the
cinders out of the locomotives

ANTHROPOID V20 26

MRS MORAVEC
That is the dirtiest job in Prague

JAN steals a look at MARIE and MARIE looks away shyly
JOSEF
Thank you for the offer Mr
Moravec We’ll keep that in mind
INT MORAVEC FLAT KITCHEN - NIGHT 32
MARIE is at the sink cleaning the dishes

JAN brings in the last of the dishes from the table

JAN leans against the fridge and takes a cigarette packet
from his pocket and offers one to MARIE

She shakes her head no
JAN lights up and takes a drag
JAN
So what do you do when you aren’t
helping out here
MARIE shrugs

There is a pause between them Electricity fills the silence

JAN
You don’t have a boyfriend

Marie shrugs her shoulders shyly and is noncommittal No one
special

There is tension and MARIE then breaks into a nervous giggle
JAN laughs a little too and the tension is relaxed

JOSEF enters with his plate He looks at the two of them
briefly before studying MARIE intensely

JOSEF
You like life in occupied Prague
Marie

MARIE

I take it not being registered with
the police as residents has
something to do with this question

JOSEF
It might

A beat

MARIE
I hate the Germans

ANTHROPOID V20 27
A beat

JOSEF
You have a friend as good looking
as you

MARIE looks to JAN and then back to JOSEF

MARIE
Why

JOSEF

Seems Prague has changed since we
were last here

(beat)
Would be less conspicuous if we
walked around with girls on our
arms

(beat)
Young love flourishes under German
occupation that sort of thing

MARIE
But you’re not that young

JOSEF
turns to Jan)
Feisty and humourous I like her
back to Marie)
Of course you can say no
serious)
Mrs Moravec saying you are
trustworthy is one thing But doing
this could get you shot
beat)
You should think about that before -

MARIE
cutting in)
My friend Lenka
beat)
She sometimes couriers messages for
Uncle Hajsky

JOSEF
Good so she knows how to keep her
mouth shut as well
MARIE nods
MARIE
We are going to a New Years Eve
dance on Wednesday night
(beat)
You would like to go
JOSEF looks at JAN
JAN shrugs

JOSEF turns back to MARIE and nods

ANTHROPOID V20

INT PRAGUE DANCE HALL - NIGHT 33

A smoky dance hall softly illuminated in soft brown hues
Tables and chairs around the edge of the floor Some six or
so couples are dancing to a swing band

JAN and JOSEF stand at the bar

The atmosphere in the dance hall has an edge It’s not
relaxed and feels slightly surreal Almost lost in time
Nervous looks A banner hung across the hall proclaims

“HAPPY NEW YEAR - 1942

A few off-duty SS officers to one corner Top buttons undone
red cheeks But people avoiding them A few whores flirt with
them

Upper class tuxedoes mixing with working class brown jackets
Business men mixing with artists and Black marketeer’s mixing
with Czech police

A group of friends drinking One is quite drunk and starts to
push a mate around A few others step in and calm the
situation down Drinks and cigarettes are handed out Nervous
looks in the direction of the SS officers

This is occupied Prague The Dance hall has an a 1920s
prohibition feeling to it and tonight being New Years eve a
temporary neutral ground for all attending but only just

JOSEF
(to the crowd)
Look at them
(beat)
Going through the motions like some
old ritual that no longer has any
joy for them

JAN
Maybe there is hope in the
pretence
JOSEF lights a cigarette he is a few beers in Turns to JAN
JAN signals OFF SCREEN

MARIE and LENKA emerge through the crowd arm in arm Both
beautiful Both receiving looks from various wannabe suitors

LENKA FAFEKOVA like MARIE is elegant with striking red hair
she is slightly older but beautiful

JAN
Looks like you fell on your feet
with Lenka

JOSEF
Stupid

JAN looks confused

ANTHROPOID V20 29
The girls approach them

MARIE
Hello Lenka this is Jan and
Josef

JOSEF turns his back on them MARIE visibly disappointed
JAN smiles nervously at MARIE Awkward pause

MARIE
You know it’s not very polite to
turn your back on a lady

JOSEF turns and talks but doesn’t look at them He looks past
them

JOSEF
I’1l pay you the compliment of
being the two most beautiful girls
in the room but this is not a night
off for us

JAN
Josef maybe you are over-reacting
a little

JOSEF gives JAN a look which silences him

JOSEF
(looking past Lenka and
Marie)
Me and Jan appreciate the effort
but the point was not to attract
attention

JAN looks over the room
A few people avert his gaze Maybe JOSEF has a point

JOSEF
In future we need you to be as
plain as possible
(beat)
Think you can do that

MARIE nods feeling small and rebuffed

LENKA
You know for most girls a little
lipstick is the only way to forget
what is happening here
(beat)
Even if it’s only for a few hours

JOSEF looks at the table with SS officers One of them
looking over Observing while inhaling a cigarette

JOSEF now looks at Lenka for the first time

ANTHROPOID V20 30

JOSEF
Your lipstick gets you noticed and
that gets us noticed and us being
noticed could get us all shot
(beat)
And now this little scene needs an
ending

LENKA frowns not understanding
JOSEF leans forward and whispers in her ear

JOSEF
Slap my face so we can leave
without suspicion

LENKA pauses for a second and understands the scene that
needs to be played She then hauls a slap across JOSEF’s
right cheek Her face plays the perfect part of a woman
scorned

LENKA
I’m not a whore

JOSEF rubs his cheek and sees the SS officer turns and
laughs with the others The acted story now clear has
averted any suspicion

JOSEF
(whispered to Lenka)
Save your lipstick and pencilled
stockings for when the war is over

JOSEF pushes past and leaves
JAN grabs his coat
JAN
(to the girls)
I think that went well

Awkward beat and JAN follows JOSEF to the exit

INT MORAVEC FLAT BOX ROOM - NIGHT 34
A machine gun is placed on the table

LADISLAV (0S)
A British Sten Mark II machine gun

JAN and JOSEF inspect the weapon and clips as LADISLAV places
two anti-tank grenades on the table

LADISLAV
One hundred rounds
(beat)
Model 73 anti-tank grenades with
pencil fuses
(beat)
(MORE)

ANTHROPOID V20 31

LADISLAV (CONTD)
That’s everything we could retrieve
from the drop canister

JOSEF takes the Mark II Sten and sniffs the barrel

JOSEF
That smell reminds me of the
training fields in Scotland

He throws the gun to JAN who catches it and takes a whiff

JAN
Gun oil and turpentine - sometimes
I think we drank it by the pint

LADISLAV
Uncle says he has made some
progress with the information you
asked for
(beat)
There is a meeting at Café Slavia
on Vodikova Street at 2pm Tuesday

LADISLAV
You are still determined to go
through with this

JOSEF looks down at the gun and then at LADISLAV The silence
confirming their stance

LADISLAV turns to leave

JOSEF
(to Ladislav and
indicating the weapon)
Ladislav thanks

LADISLAV nods and leaves

EXT PRAGUE STREETS - DAY 35

A late afternoon mist hangs in the air The blackened spires
of the churches and other buildings peek out from the mists
like a dark fairy tale

People go about their business People sit outside a café A
few nervously look around No one can be trusted Suspicion
rules the city

JOSEF is walking besides LENKA Now she looks like a plain
blonde in her late twenties

There is an awkward silence between the two JOSEF looks back
over the street behind and sees

MARIE and JAN walking together on the side walk
LENKA
I just wanted to apologise about

Saturday night
(MORE)

ANTHROPOID V20 32
LENKA (CONTD)
You were completely right to do
what you did

(beat)
Marie didn’t fully inform me of the
situation

(beat)
She is young and still has romantic
ideas about the war

JOSEF
And you

LENKA
War is not romantic

JOSEF regards her for a second She seems wise beyond her
years - another by-product of war JOSEF then looks across
the street

A man on the other side of the street in an overcoat and hat
stands looking at them

JOSEF looks over his shoulder
Another man seems to be following them

JOSEF looks back at the first man who is now greeted by a
woman and they start to walk off Is he being unduly
suspicious

LENKA
We cross here

We are now walking with JAN and MARIE and we see JOSEF and
LENKA cross the street a little up ahead

JAN
After our last date I thought you
might both show wearing potato
sacks

MARIE gives a shy smile

MARIE
Lenka was very angry that I didn’t
tell her who you both were
(beat)
I don’t know what I’m doing

JAN
You are doing fine
(beat)
Its not your fault
(beat)
It’s hard to see all the sides
(beat)

Josef just has a knack for it

MARIE
He must think me silly

ANTHROPOID V20 33

JAN
I don’t

MARIE smiles Her eyes lock with JAN’s A sweet moment

Ahead JOSEF and LENKA have now crossed the street and are
on the same side They both enter a café

A man leans on the corner outside the café Tooth pick in
mouth foot raised on the wall relaxed but looking around

JAN notices him He must be a lookout for the Jindra
Organization

JAN and MARIE pass him and into the café

INT CAFE SLAVIA -— AFTERNOON 36

A small neighbourhood café Just a few locals They look up
at JAN and JOSEF for a second before going back to their
business

The PROPRIETOR behind the counter glances up at JOSEF and JAN
and indicates to them to go through a door at the back

JOSEF and JAN turn to LENKA and MARIE

JOSEF
Take a seat here and order a drink
We won’t be long

MARIE and LENKA nod and sit down at a table

JOSEF and JAN walk through a doorway and into the back room

INT SAFE ROOM CAFE SLAVIA — AFTERNOON 37

A grey modestly furnished flat at the back of the café Both
JAN and JOSEF look round the room and see two other doors
other than the one they entered

We recognize UNCLE HAJSKY and LADISLAV head of the Jindra
group from the first meeting

JAN and JOSEF turn and see three other men Adolf OPALKA
Josef VALCIK and Karel CURDA

The men know each other and are happily reunited Smiles
handshakes and slaps on backs

LADISLAV
I see you are no strangers to one
another

JAN
We all trained special operations
together
(beat)
(MORE)

ANTHROPOID V20 34
JAN (CONTD)
Valcik here was even on the same
drop

VALCIK is a heavy set handsome man with blonde hair

VALCIK
Dropped ten minutes later and
thirty miles off course

JOSEF
Glad to see you made it in one
piece

UNCLE HAJSKY
Gentlemen please sit

JAN and JOSEF sit at the table and place their pistols in

front of them

UNCLE HAJSKY and LADISLAV are also at the table VALCIK and

OPALKA sit to one side CURDA in the background

LADISLAV
Thanks to Valcik and his group
Silver A we have finall
reestablished communications with
London

VALCIK
I have orders to send and receive
any communications between you and
London

(beat)
You have your own decoder paper
right

JOSEF and JAN nod to VALCIK

LADISLAV
Captain Opalka and Warrant Officer
Curda have completed Operation Out
Distance so both are now available
to assist you
(beat)

Captain Opalka is the senior
officer here

OPALKA early thirties looks every inch the man you would
want as the captain of your team Sharply chiselled face a

determined manner A natural leader

OPALKA

This is true but your mission
objective supersedes my rank

(beat)
We had word from London
Anthropoid Utmost priority Assist
with everything possible

(beat)
This is your show comrades

ANTHROPOID V20

CURDA a nervous man in his late twenties looks over the
meeting as UNCLE HAJSKY unfolds a map of Prague

UNCLE HAJSKY

You wanted to know everything we
could find out about Heydrich

(indicating on map)
We know he lives with his wife and
children at a country chateau in
Panenské Brezany and he has his
office in Prague at Hradcany
Castle

(beat)
Both the chateau and the castle are
heavily guarded and so are out of
the question

JOSEF
What about trips to Berlin

LADISLAV
Probably once a month He usually
travels by train we would know as
the railway starts preparing the
special carriages several days in
advance

UNCLE HAJSKY
But the station and train will be
heavily guarded

CURDA
What about derailing the train
outside of Prague

OPALKA looks at JAN and JOSEF It’s not a bad idea

JAN
(looking at Josef)
Blowing up a train

JOSEF
It’s a possibility
(to Valcik)
Explosives

VALCIK
That’s Curda’s department Curda

CURDA
I can get the explosives

JAN
What do we know about blowing up
trains

CURDA
I can show you But basically
You would need to blow the tracks
and derail--

ANTHROPOID V20 36
JOSEF
(interrupting)
We can derail the train but that
is no guarantee Heydrich is killed
(beat)
I say we check his route between
his home and the castle

LADISLAV
Uncle has made contact with an old
student of his who works as a
repairman at the castle He is
willing to help but can only
provide us with the information of
what time Heydrich arrives and what
time he leaves the day after

JAN
What good is that

UNCLE HAJSKY
You can start to build a pattern of
his routine
(beat)
Some days he travels with an armed
escort but some days he doesn’t
Maybe there is a pattern to this

CURDA
This is going to take weeks

JAN
Then it will take weeks We will
only get one shot at Heydrich
After that security will be so
tight that you won’t get an olive
between him and us without making
oil

UNCLE HAJSKY
I will rent a flat near the castle
so the repairman can drop off the
timetable from the day before on
his way to work
(beat)
Lenka or Marie can be there to
collect them for us

JOSEF

Good We’1ll check out the route he
takes between the chateau and the
castle

LADISLAV
(sliding them across)
Your medical certificates Work
exempted in case you are stopped

OPALKA
(to Jan and Josef)
What will you need

ANTHROPOID V20

JOSEF
A camera with film chemicals to
process it and make prints
Binoculars couple of bicycles a
torch and some red paint

UNCLE HAJSKY
(frowning at the request)
That’s quite a shopping list I’1l
see what I can do

A pause

UNCLE HAJSKY
Part of Operation Out Distance was
to re-supply the resistance with
much needed cyanide capsules
(beat)
We have lost so many of our people
to the Gestapo and without the
cyanide capsules many have talked -
giving up valuable information into
our operating procedures

OPALKA distributes the packets of glass vials of cyanide

UNCLE HAJSKY

In closing I just want to say to
you all that this operation is
involving almost everyone we have

(beat)
In the event you are captured by
the Gestapo you will have to face
some harsh facts There will be no
escape You will be tortured until
you tell them everything you know

(beat)
And then you will be executed

(beat)
You must protect your fellow
comrades and shut any links to them
down so carry the cyanide at all
times

A heavy beat

INT CAFE SLAVIA - DAY - SAME 38
MARIE and LENKA sit at the table drinking their coffee
A GERMAN MOTORBIKE with SIDECAR pulls up outside the Cafe

The lookout from earlier throws down his toothpick and enters
the cafe He strides up to the bar and presses the waiters
bell three times

INT SAFE ROOM CAFE SLAVIA - SAME 39
UNCLE and LADISLAV react to the bell and the others follow

suit

ANTHROPOID V20 38

JAN and JOSEF grab their pistols and JOSEF cracks the door
and the curtain to look into the Cafe

JOSEF’s POV Two GERMAN soldiers stand at the bar behind the
lookout

Behind JOSEF UNCLE opens the window to a side alley and
starts to signal to CURDA to make an escape

INT CAFE SLAVIA - DAY - SAME 40

The waiter places a coffee in front of the lookout and gives
his attention to the lead German

GERMAN SOLDIER 1
Cigarettes

The GERMAN SOLDIER 2 is looking at the photos of old Prague
on the wall - this interest is leading him closer to the back
room

JOSEF sees him moving closer and turns to see CURDA going
through the window but CURDA catches a flower pot with his
foot and the pot falls from the window sill and smashes in
the alley outside

GERMAN SOLDIER 2 hears it and he walks towards the back
room

JOSEF steals himself and takes one step away from the door
and aims his pistol

The German now on the other side of the door - reaches out
for the curtain

LENKA pushes her coffee cup from the table and it smashes on
the floor

Both the soldiers turn and look at her as she drops to one
knee and starts to pick up the pieces

GERMAN SOLDIER 2 looks back at the door

On the other side of the door - JOSEF JAN and the other men
like statues - guns at the ready

GERMAN SOLDIER 1 opens the pack as he looks down at LENKA’s
stockings as she suggestively finishes picking up the broken
cup and places it on the bar He lights the cigarette

GERMAN SOLDIER 1
(to German soldier 2 )
Kumpel lass uns gehen

GERMAN SOLDIER 2 turns and walks back to his mate

GERMAN SOLDIER 1 drops some crowns on the bar and they
leave

ANTHROPOID V20 39

INT SAFE ROOM CAFE SLAVIA - SAME 41

The men stand down and breathe a sigh of relief

INT MORAVEC FLAT MAIN ROOM - MORNING 42

CLOSE UP of the wood that JAN has been whittling JAN is now
using a filing tool The wood is taking shape into the form
of the human figure

JOSEF and JAN sit on the sofa staring ahead ATA is playing
the violin in another room MR MORAVEC is lighting up his
pipe and chattering away (one gets the impression he would
chatter away even if he didn’t have an audience)

MR MORAVEC

(draws on pipe billowing

smoke )
Out of Blue Boar tobacco Couldn’t
believe it I told him I’d been
smoking it for twenty-odd years
Didnt have any Says it’s because
of the war Didn’t believe that for
a moment

(to Jan)
Have you found work yet

JAN
Nothing concrete yet But I think
we have a plan

MR MORAVEC
We have work down at the yard
(beat)
You think perhaps you are too good
to do such work

JAN
No Mr Moravec It’s a kind offer
(beat)
Maybe if what we have planned
doesn’t work out

MR MORAVEC gives him a slightly suspicious look as he draws
on his pipe

JAN and JOSEF help MRS MORAVEC to the kitchen with the
breakfast plates

INT MORAVEC FLAT KITCHEN - MORNING 43
The dishes are being piled in the sink

MRS MORAVEC
(quietly to Josef and Jan)
There are two bicycles downstairs
for you Both black both ladies
Sorry it was all I could get I
placed them there earlier

MRS MORAVEC (CONTD)
(hands Josef two leather
cases)
A camera loaded with film and
binoculars The other bits you
asked for will be here tomorrow

EXT PANENSKE BREZANY - DAY 44

POV through binoculars The entrance to Heydrich’s chateau at
Panenské Brezany Many armed German soldiers are in evidence

JOSEF (0S)
As Uncle said there are too many
armed guards here

JAN has turned his bicycle upside down and is pretending to
fix a puncture Josef lays hidden from sight in a ditch with
his faced glued to the binoculars

JAN
(sneaking a sly look)
Looks like there is a whole
garrison there

HEYDRICH’s 35 litre Mercedes convertible sharks slowly out
of the entrance It’s being driven by his personal chauffeur
Oberscharfiihrer KLEIN The top is off and HEYDRICH sits in
the front

JOSEF
Looks like our man
(beat)
What’s the time

JAN
(checks watch)
Five minutes after nine

The Mercedes approaches them and roars past at sixty miles
per hour

JAN busy with his tire and JOSEF digging deep to keep out
sight

JOSEF
Anything else coming

JAN
No Riding solo today
(beat)
Oh wait

An armed escort now roars past doing its best to keep up with
HEYDRICH but with no way of catching up

JAN
Armed escort
(beat)
Two minutes behind

ANTHROPOID V20 41

The armed escort races past JOSEF gets up and dusts himself

down

JOSEF
(retrieving his bicycle)
If we can stop the Mercedes using a
rope or steel cable across the road
then two minutes would be all we
need

JAN

(placing his bicycle the

right way up)
Even if the rope stops the car we
need more than two minute to escape
from here We would have to deal
with the armed guard here in the
open

(beat)
It would not be my first choice

JOSEF
And if it’s our only choice

Jan is silent

JOSEF
The point of the mission is to
succeed

JAN

I’m more worried that we haven’t
planned what to do if we are
successful

JOSEF
What happens after is not
important

JAN stares at JOSEF

JAN
Just because London has given no
information that extends beyond the
mission objective doesn’t mean
there shouldn’t be one

There is a long silence between them until finally

OMITTED

JOSEF
Let’s follow the route to Hradcany
Castle

EXT PRAGUE STREET - DAY

JOSEF and JAN cycle down a street Ahead there seems to be a
commotion People in the street

ANTHROPOID V20
JAN and JOSEF come to a stop and dismount their bicycles
They push them through the people who stand and look up Some
of the people are emotional others as still as statues All
are mostly silent

German soldiers are very much in evidence A German motorbike
and side car

Soldiers with German shepherds that bark

JAN and JOSEF make their way through and then see what
everyone is looking at

Continuing all the way to the end of the street are people
hung from the street lamp posts by their necks Signs hang
from their necks “Traitor” - “Communist” - “Jew”

It’s a haunting site Hell seeping its way into the city

JAN looks at JOSEF They continue on in silence
PAN AND CROSS
FADE
47 INT CAFE - AFTERNOON 47
JOSEF smokes a cigarette Lost in thought
Looks around the cafe
Uncomfortable shuffles averted looks
A knock on the glass window JOSEF turns
It’s LENKA
JOSEF nods to her and she enters and sits opposite

They silently look at each other LENKA has made an effort to
look plain but her natural beauty is easy to see

LENKA
Do I look plain enough

JOSEF stubs out his cigarette in the ashtray and nods

LENKA
Are you sure
(teasing)
I can go rub some mud on my face if
you would like

JOSEF
We have a tram to catch Let’s go

48 INT TRAM - AFTERNOON 48

LENKA and JOSEF sit side by side

ANTHROPOID V20 43

The other passengers avert eyes The tram silent Then comes
to a stop JOSEF signals it’s their stop and they get off

EXT PRAGUE STREET NEAR CASTLE - AFTERNOON 49
Busy street with workers starting to make their way home

JOSEF and LENKA walk and suddenly in front of them are four
German soldiers waiting around

JOSEF calculates it’s too late to cross the street without
looking suspicious so they walk past them

The soldiers stare at LENKA and a couple of them wolf whistle
and a few lewd comments are heard in German

Once past JOSEF guides LENKA across the street to the corner
of Kirchmayerstrasse into Klein Holeschowitzerstrasse

JOSEF
I need to take some pictures Will
you be my model
LENKA smiles

JOSEF takes out the CAMERA from its case It’s an old
Rolleicord twin-lens reflex camera

LENKA stands in front of JOSEF

JOSEF frames the camera but it seems to be pointing at the
street behind LENKA

She looks over her shoulder at the street and then back to
JOSEF

JOSEF takes a picture and then winds the film

JOSEF
OK one from over there

LENKA re-positions herself

JOSEF re-frames Again the position of the frame seems to be
off to one side at the street corner behind her

CLICK JOSEF winds the film Re-positions the camera to the
other side of LENKA where there is a waiting tram and CLICK

LENKA realises that JOSEF is shooting a reconnaissance of the
area and has no interest in taking her photo

Another CLICK and WIND

JOSEF now points the camera at LENKA Her guard down An
honest moment The real LENKA exposed for a fraction of a
second She is looking at JOSEF but almost off into the
distance JOSEF intuitively senses something in that moment
and takes a picture

In EXTREME CLOSE UP we see the metal shutter and iris open
allowing the light onto the film The mechanical shutter
grunts and then snaps shut

EXT PRAGUE CITYSCAPE - DAWN 50

The black spires rise out of the dawn mist eerie

EXT HRADCANY CASTLE - MORNING 51

HEYDRICH’s Mercedes pulls through the gates of the castle An
armed escort right behind

From a window above the REPAIRMAN watches down as the car
enters the gates of the castle
EXT PRAGUE CITYSCAPE -DAWN 52A

A new dawn over the city as it slowly starts to wake

EXT PRAGUE STREET NEAR CASTLE - MORNING 52
We follow a man from behind as he walks down the street

CLOSE UP of the man’s hand as he reaches into his jacket
pocket and takes out a small envelope

He stops by a window of an apartment that looks out onto the
pavement and he knocks on the glass

The window opens and he hands the envelope to LENKA
He looks at her for a second He is the REPAIRMAN

The REPAIRMAN’s POV through the window he sees JOSEF and JAN
partly hidden by the blowing net curtains

The REPAIRMAN continues onto the castle

INT UNCLE HAJSKY’S RENTED FLAT - MORNING 53
LENKA gives the envelope to JOSEF He opens it
CLOSE UP on the contents

armed escort

MARIE looks at LENKA

ANTHROPOID V20 45
LENKA
Armed escort

JOSEF looks at LENKA and then at JAN Not sure how much to
reveal

LENKA
There is only one person in Prague
that travels with an armed escort

MARIE looks slightly panicked

LENKA
You’re going to assassinate
Heydrich

MARIE
What Heydrich is the target

JAN
For your own safety it’s best you
don’t ask too many questions

LENKA
It’s a bit late for that no

JOSEF
You agreed to help the resistance
Who the target is does not concern
you

LENKA
We are about to help you murder
Reinhard Heydrich Of course it
concerns us

JAN
OK everyone just calm down

JAN leads MARIE to a seat at the table Makes her sit

JAN
Maybe it was a mistake not to
inform you of the danger

MARIE
(still reeling)
Murder Heydrich

JOSEF
Assassinate
(beat)
Murder somehow implies he has a
life worth living

On the table in front of LENKA is JOSEF’s pistol
LENKA
You think I’m some little girl that

is just here to follow the
important parachutists around

ANTHROPOID V20 46

54B

She takes JOSEF’s pistol and strips the clip the top barrel
removes the chambered bullet and inspects the line then
resembles it It all takes no more than six seconds

She stands and walks towards JOSEF where she hands him the
gun

LENKA

We have been resisting in our own
way from the beginning

(beat)
I personally don’t have any
reservations killing a Nazi pig

(beat)
But don’t treat us as though what
you are about to do doesn’t affect
us

(beat)
It does and it will

(hands Josef his pistol)
And you should keep your weapon
clean It’s filthy

JOSEF shares a look with JAN They’ve been told

INT MORAVEC FLAT BOX ROOM - NIGHT 54B
JOSEF places the camera on the table

Pours some chemicals into a measuring jug and then into a
soup pot Indicates to JAN to hit the light The room goes
dark and JOSEF takes the film from the camera and places it
in the pot

JOSEF
OK

JAN switches the light back on and JOSEF shakes the pot while
looking at his watch

JOSEF places a light bulb into a pot of red paint

The negatives are processed and JOSEF inspects them under the
room light

Books are placed on top of one another forming two small
towers

A 12x12 cm matte is cut from white card to be used as a
printing easel

JOSEF removes the back of the camera and balances the camera

between the books with the lens facing down and the open back
facing up

ANTHROPOID V20 47

The now red light bulb is screwed into the socket JAN
switches the main light off and JOSEF switches on the red
bulb The room bathed in red light safe for printing

The negatives are laid onto the open camera back and JAN
holds a torch above to shine light through the negative The
negative is projected through the lens and appears onto the
board below

JOSEF turns the focus knob and a negative image comes into
sharp focus on the printing easel - A home made enlarger

The torch is switched off and paper placed into the easel
The torch is switched back on and then off for an exposure

The printing paper is then placed into a frying pan filled
with developing chemical and gently rocked

An image of a Prague street slowly starts to appear on the
printing paper

INT MORAVEC FLAT KITCHEN - EVENING 55

MRS MORAVEC is doing the dishes with MARIE doing the drying
In the background we hear ATA practicing the violin

INT MORAVEC FLAT BOX ROOM - EVENING 56

JAN and JOSEF sit looking through the photos that JOSEF took
with the Rolleicord

Street of the route Heydrich takes to work everyday On the
edge of each photo is an out of focus LENKA

JOSEF takes a magnifying glass and studies the photos in
minute detail

CLOSE UP of photo - The sharp turning from Kirchmayerstrasse
into Klein Holeschowitzerstrasse

JOSEF
So in the morning he approaches
from that direction and then turns
here to his right
(beat)
It’s a pretty sharp turn He would
have to slow down quite a bit

JAN
It’s the slowest part of the whole
route
JOSEF
(nods )
Were not going to find anywhere
better

ANTHROPOID V20 48

JAN
(shrugs )
Perhaps not perfect but you’re
right nowhere better

They regard each other and are in agreement JOSEF looks down
at the photos and sees the final photo he took of LENKA It
stops him and he regards it for a second JOSEF separates the
photo from the rest and places it in his wallet

JAN notices JOSEF stands

INT MORAVEC FLAT MAIN ROOM - EVENING 57

ATA stands in front of a music sheet stand practicing as
JOSEF enters the room JOSEF watches ATA perform

ATA finishes the piece and looks at JOSEF

JOSEF
I need to see Uncle Can you let
him know

ATA nods

MR MORAVEC enters the front door He sees JOSEF talking
closely to ATA and he sees ATA nodding in affirmation

ATA and JOSEF look over at MR MORAVEC A moments pause and
then JOSEF heads back to his room and ATA starts playing the
violin

MR MORAVEC looks concerned

INT UNCLE HAJSKY’S RENTED FLAT - MORNING 58

JAN sits whittling the wood and looking up inspects MARIE who
sits opposite trying to reassemble JAN’s pistol

JAN
Breach over the lock
(beat)
Slide and release

She completes the action

JAN
There you go

MARIE smiles at learning the action

MARIE
Tell me what London was like

JAN
(reminiscing)
Me and Josef only went once There
was a blackout in place and then a
Blitz raid
(MORE)

ANTHROPOID V20 49
JAN (CONTD)
The London Underground was used as
air raid shelters and we spent the
night there listening to the
English sing their songs

There are three knocks followed by one knock on the window
JAN stops and MARIE goes to the window and opens it

The REPAIRMAN passes the envelope through He looks past
MARIE and locks eyes with JAN

JANs POV of the REPAIRMAN is interrupted by the net curtain
blowing in the wind

The REPAIRMAN then leaves and continues to work
MARIE hands it to JAN
JAN switches his attention to the envelope Opens it

JAN
917 - 442 Without

JAN writes it down on the sheet We see that there is at
least eight such entry times on the sheet

JAN runs his hands through his hair and exhales a frustrated
breath

MARIE looks at JAN

JAN
I don’t see any pattern The start
times are consistent but the armed
escort seems to be pot luck
(beat)
Some days yes some days they’re on
their own

MARIE
Are you really going to go through
with this

JAN

We have our orders

MARIE

So you kill Heydrich What then
You think there aren’t more like
him They come and the killing
continues even worse than it did
before

(beat)
When does it stop

JAN
I wish I had an answer for you You
think any of this makes sense to
me
(beat)
Things used to be simple
(MORE)

ANTHROPOID V20 50

JAN (CONTD)
I worked at a paper factory Clock
in at eight clock out at five
Wages on a Friday and a drink with
the boys A date on Saturday go to
the pictures on Sunday

(beat)

Now I’ve been given orders to
assassinate a high ranking SS
officer that very few of us will
have any chance of walking away
from

MARIE holds a clenched fist to her chest as if in pain

MARIE
Then let’s walk away now Let’s
just leave

JAN
And go where Marie You think we
can escape from what is happening
Pretend this madness is not real

MARIE

Some days I’m not even sure it is
real Heydrich chokes the people of
this city with a blanket of fear
People shot for what Their race
Their religion Their cigarettes

(beat)
And my father says we are lucky as
the Germans need the Czech people
and their factories to make
armaments

(starts to cry)
You hear the stories about Poland

JAN takes her hand

JAN
Shhh Marie it’s okay

They are suddenly very close looking at one another

MARIE
(searches Jans eyes)
We were taught ‘Thou shall not
kill’ and yet here we are planning
to kill someone Just tell me we
are doing the right thing That two
wrongs will somehow make a right

JAN searches her eyes for the longest time
EXT CITY PARK - DAY 59

JOSEF and LENKA walk through the mist covered park The trees
seem like black statues

ANTHROPOID V20 51
LENKA looks over JOSEF New lines of stress have appeared on
his face

JOSEF
I think it’s my turn to apologize
to you about the other morning
beat)
You were right to be angry We
should have told you what was at
risk
beat)
To give you the choice to walk
away

LENKA
ironic huff)
Walk away
beat)
Opinions are divided as to what
constitutes resistance
beat)
Many have got used to German rule
beat)
Many are just scared

JOSEF
But not you

LENKA’s turn to give JOSEF a silent glance

JOSEF
You know your way around a pistol

LENKA

My father was a captain in the
army

(beat)
Wanted sons but got three
daughters

(beat)
He and many others were arrested in
‘39 when Germany took control of
Czechoslovakia

(beat)
When Heydrich first took power here
last September his first order was
to execute all the prisoners

JOSEF
I’m sorry

LENKA

My father was among five thousand
of the best military and academic
minds shot in the first week by
Heydrich

(beat)
Afterwards people started to call
Heydrich the butcher of Prague

(beat)
So for me there is no walking
away Heydrich is worth the risk

ANTHROPOID V20 52
JOSEF give her a look She like many people has lost a lot
since the invasion of Czechoslovakia

LENKA nods
There is a man sitting on a bench reading a newspaper

JOSEF and LENKA sit on the bench next to him and we see it’s
UNCLE HAJSKY

LENKA sits in the middle and JOSEF acts as if he is talking
to LENKA but he’s actually talking to UNCLE HAJSKY

JOSEF
We have checked the route
(beat)
We think we know how to do it

UNCLE HAJSKY
What will you need

JOSEF
We are going to need Opalka Valcik
and Curda

UNCLE HAJSKY
OK I will arrange a meeting at the
café the day after tomorrow 3pm

JOSEF
Our original contact address here
in Prague was Oldrich Novak Did
you ever find out who had informed
the Gestapo about him

UNCLE HAJSKY shakes his head no

JOSEF
Who was his direct handler

UNCLE HAJSKY
Vanek Ladislav

JOSEF
And Ladislav How long has he been
part of the Jindra resistance

UNCLE HAJSKY
He was one of the first

JOSEF
You trust him

UNCLE HAJSKY
(thinks)
Yes Why

JOSEF

He is one most opposed to what we
have to do

ANTHROPOID V20 53

UNCLE HAJSKY
He fears reprisals

JOSEF
From the Gestapo if he doesn’t
inform them or from Jindra if he
does
JOSEF stands and LENKA follows
JOSEF
(lighting a cigarette)
When a man doesn’t want to rock the
boat you have to ask what is he
afraid of
A long pause as UNCLE HAJSKY thinks about it

UNCLE HAJSKY
I’1l1 look into it

JOSEF and LENKA continue their stroll through the park

INT UNCLE HAJSKY’S RENTED FLAT - DAY 60
JOSEF and LENKA enter the flat
JAN and MARIE are nowhere to be seen

A soft clicking noise and we see a gramophone the record
finish the needle catching

LENKA picks up the needle and looks at the record that was
playing She smiles and puts the needle back to the beginning
of the record

JOSEF opens the door to the bedroom

JAN stands by the bed pulling his trouser braces over his
shoulders his shirt undone MARIE is in the bed She pulls
the sheets over her naked breasts

The music starts in the background

JOSEF
Sorry

He closes the door and looks at LENKA

A brief moment passes before them before they both try and
make themselves busy

INT CAFE SLAVIA -— AFTERNOON 61
Steam pours from a large antiquated coffee machine

JAN and JOSEF enter with LENKA and MARIE The girls take a
seat at the table near the window

ANTHROPOID V20 54
JOSEF and JAN nod to the PROPRIETOR behind the counter as
they go to the back room

INT CAFE SLAVIA SAFE ROOM — AFTERNOON 62

OPALKA VALCIK are drinking cikorka UNCLE HAJSKY and
LADISLAV at the table JOSEF and JAN join them CURDA guards
the curtain at the café doorway

JOSEF takes out a map of Prague and spreads it on the table

JOSEF
We have checked every inch of his
route from his home to the castle
(points at the map)
Here

OPALKA checks the map

JOSEF
Corner of Kirchmayerstrasse into
Klein Holeschowitzerstrasse

OPALKA nods

OPALKA
His car would have to slow down to
take that corner

JOSEF

Really slow down

(beat)

He takes it at about 10 miles per
hour

JAN

Weve looked everywhere else and we
think this is the only place it can
be done

OPALKA
(checks the area on the
map)
You have good exit routes The busy
street will add to the confusion
and cover your escape

JAN
We averaged out all his morning
arrival times and can expect him at
approximately 930am

OPALKA
Weapons

JOSEF

At that range The Sten gun should
hit everything within the car

ANTHROPOID V20 55
JAN
We also have two Model 73 anti-tank
grenades
(beat)
We may need more than the guns to
stop the vehicle The grenades can
be rigged to explode on impact

UNCLE HAJSKY
And the armed escort

There is a slight pause JOSEF looks at JAN

JAN
We have found no pattern for the
armed escort Some days he has it
some days he doesn’t

JOSEF
Valcik we are going to need a look
out fifty yards up the road here
(taps the map)
We will need an early signal to
know if the armed escort is with
him or not

VALCIK nods

OPALKA
And if it is

JOSEF
Then we stand down and await the
next day

LADISLAV
Comrades you know I have been
against this action from the start
I can’t give the go-ahead without
asking London to reconsider

Glances are exchanged between UNCLE HAJSKY and JOSEF

CURDA
I’m with Ladislav We should get
London to rethink our position here
in Prague

JOSEF
We have our orders

CURDA
It’s easy for London to give
orders - it’s our lives on the
line

LADISLAV
(overlapping)
Then at least wait for re-
confirmation

ANTHROPOID V20

JOSEF
It’s taken four months just to get
this far
(beat)
London needs action

LADISLAV
Then a few more days won’t make a
difference
(looking to Valcik)
Valcik How long before you can get
to the transmitter

VALCIK
We can get to the transmitter the
day after tomorrow Then a couple
of days for London to transmit back
the answer

UNCLE HAJSKY
Then that is settled Remain at the
Moravecs’ place I’1l contact you
through Ata

Grave looks are exchanged from the divided men

INT MORAVEC FLAT MAIN ROOM - NIGHT 63
Close up of a birthday cake with 19 candles
Everyone congratulates ATA on his birthday

The cake is placed in front of ATA He blows out the candles -
a moments darkness

Clapping and cheers - A brief mood of merriment within so
much repression

MARIE turns on the lights of the living room

JAN JOSEF MARIE LENKA MR and MRS MORAVEC all present as
the cake is cut and distributed

Wine glasses show that all are relaxed and in good cheer

ATA
Thank you

JOSEF raises a glass to ATA

JAN has his arm around MARIE and he looks slightly drunk as
he knocks back his glass of wine

He whispers something in her ear and then ‘tings’ his wine
glass with a tea spoon

JAN
Ata I know tonight is your party
but I just wanted to make a little
announcement

ANTHROPOID V20 57

JAN clears his throat and smiles at MARIE
JAN
I have asked Marie to marry me and
she has said yes

More clapping and words of congratulations are spoken

JOSEF smiles but it fades to a dark look that he tries to
cover

LENKA notices it and JOSEF sees that she has seen it - looks
away
INT MORAVEC FLAT BOX ROOM - LATER 64

JOSEF stands in front of a mirror shaving Mind deep in
thought

In the background JAN enters the room He is drunk Swaying

JOSEF watches him in the mirror the elephant in the room is
putting him off his shave JAN regards him

JOSEF wipes his face with a towel and faces JAN
JOSEF
You know why we are here right
(beat)
What we are about to do

JAN nods eyes trying to focus on JOSEF as he processes the
thought and regrettably nods

JOSEF
Then what the fuck are you doing

JAN lost in thought then a hopeful look at JOSEF

JAN
Who is to say it won’t happen
(beat
London calls it off
JOSEF
They wont
(beat)
We’re too close and London knows
it

Jan starts to emotionally break a little
JOSEF steps forward and grabs the lapel of his jacket

JOSEF
You got to lock that away
(beat)
I don’t want your emotions
affecting your judgement and
jeopardizing the operation

ANTHROPOID V20 58

JAN nods Coming back to focus and putting on a brave face

JAN

I have to think that there is a way
through this

(beat)
That when this is all over there
will be a normal life waiting for
us The way things used to be

(beat)
Marie makes me feel that there is
hope

(beat)
I love her

JOSEF doesn’t have an answer He has nothing similar that
gives him strength other than the mission itself Maybe he is
even a little envious that JAN has this

He releases his grip on JAN’s lapel

INT UNCLE HAJSKY’S RENTED FLAT - DAY 65

JOSEF sits at the table The Sten gun in 4 pieces laid out
before him He is slotting the weapon back together
BLINDFOLDED He does it quickly placing the finished gun on
the table

JAN looks at his watch
JAN
15 seconds but you didn’t add the
gunstock
JOSEF removes the blind fold
JOSEF
Lighter and smaller without it
(beat)
OK I will try doing under my coat

LENKA and MARIE watch on as JOSEF takes the gun apart again

LATER and we see a series of close up shots of the Model 73
anti-tank grenade being taken apart and replaced with new
pencil fuses

JAN
The Model 73 is just too big

Sweat pours from JAN’s face as he concentrates on the
explosive

JAN takes the explosive from the Model 73 and fits it into
cout down water canteen and tapes it up with tape He
finishes the delicate work and slowly slides them across the
table

ANTHROPOID V20 59

JAN
Had the idea to transfer the Model
73 into water canteen for better
portability
JOSEF seems impressed
JAN
(placing the finished item
in front)
Rigged for impact detonation

JOSEF
Don’t drop them

JAN moves his hand and knocks one of the Model 73 grenades
over it rolls and falls off the edge of the table

JOSEF dives for it and catches it before it hits the ground
JAN looks down at JOSEF on his back with amusement

JAN
That’s the empty one

They both start to laugh nerviously

INT MORAVEC FLAT MAIN ROOM - EVENING 66

JAN JOSEF MRS MORAVEC and MR MORAVEC are sitting around the
crowded table The meal is coming to an end

ATA enters and takes a seat He sees his father lighting his
pipe and slides an envelope across the table towards JOSEF

ATA
(whisper)
From Uncle

JOSEF takes the envelope and nods

INT MORAVEC FLAT BOX ROOM - EVENING 67
JOSEF opens the envelope and takes a piece of paper from it
The page full of letters like a letter puzzle

He holds it up to the light and JAN takes the DECODER PAPER
we saw earlier from under the bed and small book

JOSEF starts to decode the message Looking at sentences in a
book and counting the letters he starts to decode the
message

JOSEF

(beat)
Nothing about getting us out
afterwards

JOSEF
We complete the mission and await
further instructions from London

JAN
London knows this is a probable
suicide mission

A long pause between the men as they consider this It’s
interrupted by three sudden knocks at the front door KNOCK
KNOCK KNOCK

JAN and JOSEF grab their guns Then
KNOCK

JAN
It’s Uncle

INT MORAVEC FLAT HALLWAY - EVENING 68

JOSEF opens the front door UNCLE HAJSKY and LADISLAV stand
there

They let them in They look slightly panicked

INT MORAVEC FLAT DINING ROOM - EVENING 69
The men stand around the dining table

UNCLE HAJSKY

We have a problem

(beat)
One of our spies within the
Heydrich house has read a piece of
correspondence that has ordered
Heydrich back to Berlin

(beat)
Within the household there have
been conversations about a new
posting to Paris

(beat)
It means that after he leaves for
Berlin he may not be back

JAN
When does he leave

UNCLE HAJSKY
28th May

ANTHROPOID V20 61
Panicked looks

J
That’s the day after tomorrow

UNCLE HAJSKY
Tomorrow morning will be your only
chance
(beat)
After that he is gone for good

Looks are exchanged

JOSEF
Then we have no choice We do it
tomorrow

LADISLAV takes a long look at UNCLE

Silence

JAN
What is it

UNCLE HAJSKY
Vanek here received a transmission
from London

JAN
And

LADISLAV
They agreed with my request to
stand down the mission

He takes a piece of paper from his pocket and reads

LADISLAV
We believe we see the situation
clearly therefore given the
situation any actions against
officials of the German Reich do
not come into consideration Let
Jindra group know

JAN looks hopefully at JOSEF

JOSEF
Uncle gave us a coded message from
London Our mission has not
changed We are to go ahead as
planned

LADISLAV
But this clearly states you must
stand down

JOSEF
That message was not for us and we
do not recognize it as a direct
order to stand down

ANTHROPOID V20

LADISLAV
Then at least wait for us to
clarify it It may have superceded
your order

JOSEF
We do not have the luxury of time
After tomorrow Heydrich is gone

UNCLE HAJSKY
I have to agree with Josef That
transmission does not read like a
direct order and I believe it was
sent to settle nerves within the
Jindra group

A long silence then LADISLAV gathers his things
LADISLAV

I know you all doubt me Suspect me
of collaboration

UNCLE HAJSKY LADISLAV
Vanek Please stop Uncle
LADISLAV
I know you’ve had me followed
(beat)

I understand you don’t trust me but
you have been planning this mission
for the last five months If I was
an informer for the Gestapo you
think you would still be here Do
you

JOSEF
Then why are you so against it
(beat)
What are you afraid of

LADISLAV gives a huff with a shake of the head

LADISLAV
And Jesus asked him “What is your
name” He replied “My name is
Legion for we are many
beat)
What kind of retribution is fitting
for the man that may be the devil
himself
beat)
I fear Czechoslovakia will be wiped
from the map
beat)
You ask me if I’m afraid
beat)
Yes I’m afraid

A pregnant pause hangs in the air

LADISLAV turns on his heels and leaves passing Mr Moravec
as he enters the dinning room

ANTHROPOID V20 63

The raised voices have clearly woken Mr Moravec from his
sleep

MR MORAVEC
What is going on here

JAN
I’m sorry Mr Moravec Please go
back to bed

A long tense moment

MR MORAVEC

I know what you are planning to do

(beat)
We are all resisting in our own
way But I must think of my family
first

(beat)
I would like you both gone from
here after tomorrow

The men nod and Mr Moravec finally leaves

JOSEF
(back to Uncle)
We do it tomorrow morning As
planned

UNCLE HAJSKY
And if he has an armed escort
(beat)
We can’t stand down and wait
another day

A few tense looks

JOSEF

Get word to Opalka Curda and
Valcik If there is an escort then
they can keep them busy but the
first bullet has to be for
Heydrich

(beat)
Tell them to be on the corner at
8am

UNCLE HAJSKY gives a sad but reassuring smile

UNCLE HAJSKY
May God be with you

UNCLE HAJSKY and LADISLAV turn and leave

INT MORAVEC FLAT BOX ROOM - NIGHT 70
JOSEF places the weapons on a small table

JOSEF examines the Sten gun He removes the stock to make it
shorter

ANTHROPOID V20 64
JOSEF clears the chamber of the Sten clocks it and releases
the trigger The hammer makes a hollow click He dismantles
it into 3 pieces and places it in a black bag and then
places some STRAW over the top to hide it

JAN
It’s tomorrow

JAN is pacing again like a caged animal He is trying to deep
breathe but the walls seem to be crashing inwards
Frustration of the uncertainty of what lays ahead Panic
attack fast approaching Hyperventilating and muscle cramps

JAN
It’s tomorrow

JOSEF goes to him but JAN pushes him away
JAN
(breaking down)
I don’t want to die tomorrow

JOSEF grabs him and tries to restrain him JAN resists A
vase is knocked from the side table and smashes on the floor

JOSEF gets behind JAN and controls a slide down the wall
until they are both sat on the floor JOSEF behind JAN

MRS MORAVEC comes in JOSEF holds one hand up to her

JOSEF
It’s okay it’s okay

MRS MORAVEC looks worried but nods and leaves the room
JOSEF
Hey Hey Breathe With me
(beat)
Big breathe in
(beat)
Big breathe out
Grabs a clip and a box of ammo from the table

JOSEF
Here Look as we were trained

JOSEF loads a bullet into the clip

JOSEF
Nice and easy You do it

JAN starts to load a bullet in to the clip

JOSEF
That’s it Easy does it And again

JAN loads another The panic attack subsiding

ANTHROPOID V20 65

JOSEF
There you go

(beat)
It’s OK Breathe concentrate on
the detail

It’s an incredibly tender and heart-breaking scene We have
never seen JAN this vulnerable before and we have never seen
JOSEF this caring

JAN
I’ve shot at men in the field
(beat)
Never killed one up close

JOSEF
We have a job to do People are
counting on us
JAN
If he does have an armed escort
tomorrow
JOSEF
We must send a clear message that
we are not afraid That
Czechoslovakia is not afraid
(beat)
Whatever the outcome for us
Heydrich must die
A pause JOSEF nods his head

JAN looks into space for a second and then nods his head in
agreement
INT MORAVEC FLAT BOX ROOM - NIGHT 71

Two beds on the floor Soft moonlight bathes the room A
clock gently ticks

JAN and JOSEF’s eyes are wide open and staring up at the
ceiling Each lost in thoughts of the mission
EXT PRAGUE PANORAMA - DAWN 72

A high-angled panoramic shot of the city of Prague

INT MORAVEC FLAT DINING ROOM - MORNING 73

JAN and JOSEF enter the dining room with their coats and
briefcases

MRS MORAVEC stands and begins to gather the dishes

ATA eats breakfast and MR MORAVEC gives JAN and JOSEF a dark
look

ANTHROPOID V20 66

Awkward silence

MRS MORAVEC takes the plates out to the kitchen

JAN follows her out

INT MORAVEC FLAT KITCHEN - EVENING 74

MRS MORAVEC starts
that JAN is looking

to wash the dishes She is suddenly aware
at her They exchange a glance

JAN hands MRS MORAVEC the small figure he has carved in wood

MRS MORAVEC looks a

t the figure in her palm

CLOSE UP of the figure It’s a wooden figure of a German SS

officer

She suddenly unders

tands swallows hard

MRS MORAVEC then looks across to ATA who is wiping his plate
with a crust of bread unaware of what has just taken place

but he must know

MRS MORAVEC places the figurine into the front pocket of her
pinafore and brushes some imagined crumbs from her dress She
nods in confirmation

MRS MORAVEC leans on the counter for support She looks at

JAN both silent

EXT MORAVEC BUILDING - EARLY MORNING 75

JAN and JOSEF walk across the street and to an alley where
two bicycles are parked They pull the bicycles into the
street and find LENKA waiting there She looks deeply pre-
occupied and doesn’t take her eyes off JOSEF

JAN notices

JAN

I’1l wait for you up the street

JAN walks off and leaves LENKA and JOSEF facing each other

LENKA

Uncle said we weren’t needed for a

while

(beat)
It’s today isn’t it

JOSEF nods

A long pause hangs in the air between the two of them

LENKA

Promise me -

ANTHROPOID V20 67

She stops halfway through her sentence She knows that nobody
can promise anything in times like this

Their eyes locked Time almost frozen

JOSEF steps forward and kisses her His action quick His
body almost swallowing her up And then he is gone LENKA
finds gravity again with a sound of expelled breath

JOSEF now striding off in to the distance Doesn’t look back

EXT KIRCHMAYERSTRASSE - MORNING 76

JOSEF and JAN cycle down the street Ahead they see VALCIK
and OPALKA standing by a tram stop

JOSEF and JAN park their bicycles against a fence

The four men meet and light cigarettes as if they are just
normal men ready to start their day’s journey to work

JAN
(checking watch)
We have plenty of time 825
(beat)
Where is Curda

OPALKA and VALCIK shrug CURDA is missing

JOSEF

(lighting cigarette)
Valcik you take to the hill up
there

(checking the sky)
We have some sun so take this
mirror

(beat)
If he approaches without an armed
escort then use it to signal this

VALCIK
And if he does
JOSEF
Then light a cigarette

(beat)
When the car slows to take the
corner I will step out and open
fire with the Sten My action will
signal the attack

(beat)
Jan stand behind the attack point
so you can throw the grenades at
the armed escort if there is one

(beat)
Opalka when you see the car
approach try a slow walk across
the street see if you can slow him
down even further before he takes
the corner

ANTHROPOID V20 68
JOSEF (CONTD)
(Opalka nods)
Good luck
The men disperse to their agreed stations
JOSEF and JAN take a seat on a nearby bench JOSEF takes the
parts of the Sten gun from the black bag and re-assembles
them under his raincoat which is draped across his legs
VALCIK has taken up his position further along from where he
will get the first sight of HEYDRICH He looks at his watch
905

OPALKA looks up towards VALCIK then across to where JOSEF and
JAN are sitting

JOSEF pulls the firing pin back on the Sten The hollow sound
indicates that the weapon is cocked and ready

JAN
All good

JOSEF
Good

They both stand up

There is a moment between them Everything has led to this
They give a nod

JOSEF nods and JAN turns towards his position further up
Klein Holeschowitzerstrasse

JAN looks across to OPALKA and nods as several trams arrive
and disgorge passengers

A WOMAN passes pushing a pram

A MAN hobbles by on crutches

Two YOUNG LOVERS walk by hand in hand

A car honks its horn

A horse pulls a cart loaded with scrap metal

This is Prague a living city On the verge of a major event
JOSEF and JAN look up to VALCIK waiting for a signal

JAN looks at his wristwatch 1010

JAN looks over to JOSEF who gives a shrug

JAN looks down His hand starts to shake uncontrollably He
grabs his wrist and tries to stop it His breathing is heavy

JAN

(to himself)
Breathe as we were trained

ANTHROPOID V20 69
He looks up

VALCIK at the top of the street suddenly turns and gives the
signal a mirror flashing the reflection of the morning sun
across the faces of JAN and JOSEF HEYDRICH is approaching
and without an armed escort

JOSEF steps out to the corner of the street with the Sten gun
concealed under his draped coat

JAN opens the brief case and grabs a grenade ready to throw
Two trams come to a halt on the opposite side of the road

HEYDRICH’s Mercedes speeds over the hill and down
Kirchmayerstrasse

JAN looks at the Mercedes as it starts to slow down

JAN’s POV As OPALKA crosses the street in front of the
Mercedes The Mercedes breaks and sounds its horn at OPALKA

JOSEF sees the Mercedes approaching him and the turning
JANs POV of the Mercedes approaching JOSEF and the turning

JOSEF steps into the road The Mercedes is now only several
yards away as it approaches him

JOSEF throws off the coat covering the Sten gun raises it
and aims at HEYDRICH who is sitting in the open front
passenger seat

HEYDRICH’s POV JOSEF looming ahead Sten gun in hand
JOSEF has the target in point blank range A sure thing
Time slows down

JOSEF pulls the trigger

“CLICK”
It is a single hollow sound that comes from the Sten gun
IT HAS JAMMED

JOSEF pulls the trigger again

“CLICK”

IN SLOW MOTION and IN CLOSE UP JOSEF re-cocks the firing pin
A piece of STRAW is seen caught within the breach

“CLICK”
KLEIN
(Heydrichs driver)
Scheisse

HEYDRICH sees this and immediately grabs his pistol

ANTHROPOID V20 70
HEYDRICH
Halten das auto

HEYDRICH stands up with his pistol and aims at JOSEF

JAN’s POV of HEYDRICH standing aiming his pistol at the
frozen JOSEF

JOSEF pulls at the trigger again - “CLICK”
JAN
(screams )
RUN

JAN steps forward and throws a grenade at the Mercedes

JOSEF throws down the Sten and stares down the barrel of
HEYDRICH’s gun

BOOOOM
JANs grenade explodes at the rear of the vehicle

The blast throws up a shower of fragments from the car some
of which hit JAN in the face

From inside a nearby tram the blast from the bomb shatters
all the windows showering the passengers with glass There
are shouts and screams from the dazed and frightened
passengers

An angle from within the tram We see the driver KLEIN firing
his pistol at JAN

JANs escape is blocked by a now crowded road Blood pours
from a cut above his eye He fires shots into the air to
clear a path through He mounts his bicycle and pedals off
furiously

Behind him VALCIK has pulled a pistol and fires two shots at
KLEIN

KLEIN ducks and returns four shots

One hits VALCIK in the thigh and he goes down
KLEIN then turns and sees

JAN getting away on the bicycle

KLEIN steps forward and fires two shots

But JAN is covered by the crowd and two of them get caught in
the cross fire

A clear path opens up for KLEIN and a good shot at JAN is
lost as JAN disappears round the corner of a building

HEYDRICH is now out of the car and is holding his pistol but
he is in great pain He has been hit somewhere

ANTHROPOID V20 71

HEYDRICH staggers towards JOSEF and fires several shots at
him The shots are returned by JOSEF from behind a telegraph
pole

HEYDRICH then collapses as KLEIN appears beside him

JOSEF fires two quick rounds but they miss KLEIN and
HEYDRICH

KLEIN runs at JOSEF firing his pistol

JOSEF runs up the hill with KLEIN in pursuit KLEIN goes to
fire at JOSEF but his gun is empty

JOSEF fires a couple of shots back at KLEIN but fails to hit
him

VALCIK is back up and attempting to run from the scene with a
bad limp

HEYDRICH is slumped against the side of the car Pale
Laboured breathing The CAMERA TRACKS OFF him and TRACKS into
the passenger seat A hole has been blown through the seat
and its horse hair stuffing is exposed Blood slowly drips
from the horse hair Drip drip drip

Reaching the bottom of the hill JOSEF sees a butcher’s shop
and hopes he can find refuge there He runs towards it

INT BUTCHER’S SHOP - MORNING 77

A small shop with the BUTCHER cutting meat on a block JOSEF
rushes in and the BUTCHER is immediately alarmed by his
presence and attempts to throw him out

JOSEF points his Colt semi-automatic at him and the BUTCHER
runs out into the street

JOSEF goes through to the back of the shop and finds that
there is no rear entrance He returns to the front of the
shop and looks out

POV through the shop window - JOSEF sees the BUTCHER talking
to KLEIN and gesticulating towards his shop

Time is running out for JOSEF He must act soon He runs from
the shop gun aimed

He has caught KLEIN unawares

KLEIN raises his gun and fires but JOSEF is quicker and
shoots at him twice hitting him in the leg and hip as KLEIN
drops to the ground

JOSEF runs out down the street and into an alley

ANTHROPOID V20 72

EXT PRAGUE STREET - MORNING 78

JOSEF emerges from the alley and runs for a moving tram He
catches up and jumps on board

INT TRAM - MORNING 79

JOSEF is out of breath He moves up the tram and takes a
seat He throws a few nervous glances around the tram but
nobody seems to be paying him any attention

The tram gains distance from the chaotic scene behind

EXT PRAGUE STREET TOWN SQUARE - MORNING 80
The tram comes to a stop and JOSEF steps off

He looks around trying to get his bearings and sets off ina
northerly direction

EXT MORAVEC BUILDING - MORNING 81

As JOSEF approaches the building he sees CURDA waiting
outside He seems greatly agitated

JOSEF
Where were you Curda

CURDA
I didn’t think you were really
going to do it

JOSEF grabs him by the collar looks like he is going to
smash his face in

CURDA
It’s all over the radio
(beat)
You shot him

JOSEF clenches his jaw in anger and then releases him

CURDA
The radio said that 20000 SS
troops have been drafted in to look
for us
(Beat)
I have to get my family out of
Prague

JOSEF
No one is going anywhere You try
and flee now they will pick you up
before you get to the city limits
Go back to your family batten down
the hatches and stay calm Stay out
of sight and keep your mouth shut
Think you can do that

JOSEF enters

JAN is already there He is sitting on a bench as MRS MORAVEC
treats his wounds with iodine JAN is weakened and greatly
agitated Did they or did they not succeed

A heavy silence hangs in the air between them

JOSEF slowly shakes his head in utter disbelief of the events
that have just happened

JOSEF loses it and swipes some tins of food off a shelf

He was definitely wounded

Looks like the whole of Prague is
crawling with Germans

UNCLE HAJSKY
It was to be expected

We didn’t even kill him

UNCLE HAJSKY
Wounded

JAN
How bad

UNCLE HAJSKY

(shrugs )
It is hard to say The SS still
have the hospital surrounded so
presumably he’s still alive The
Germans have more men and guns up
there than they have on the Eastern
front

him towards their new hiding place

German soldiers are greatly in evidence Loud speakers echo
instructions regarding the curfew now in place

The magnificent main part of the cathedral with the altar at
the end A balcony high above runs around the nave

JOSEF and JAN enter the cathedral and stand in admiration
looking at the fittings and decorations They both cross
themselves The silence weighs heavily upon them

Footsteps are heard FATHER (Vladimir) PETREK approaches He
is a tall angular man with deep set eyes a moustache and
goatee beard He is in his early fifties He has a gentle but
direct manner

JOSEF and JAN descend the steps into the crypt

The crypt measures some fifty by twelve feet and is around
ten feet high It is made of stone There are square-shaped
niches in the wall where coffins were once placed At some
time in the past the coffins have been removed and the niches

became ossuaries

At the bottom VALCIK limps over with OPALKA to greet them

VALCIK
You made it

VALCIK
Was caught in the crossfire Just a

scratch
There is a solemn air to their reunion

the street measuring about five foot by one the only
ventilation for the crypt

We hear the sound of a loud speaker echoing a looped message
in both Czech(English) and German

EXT PRAGUE STREETS - DAY 99
The Germans put up reward signs and appeals for information
all over Prague Leaflets are given out in the street The
appeals are in shop windows People are interrogated in the
street beaten marched off arrested

assassination attempt are displayed in the Bata shop window

There is a sign in the window It reads

2 Who saw them at the scene of the crime
3 To whom do these objects belong

Whoever is able to provide this information and who fails to

They greet an out of breath FATHER PETREK at the top

A long pause as the men await the news

hospital

You sure of this

ANTHROPOID V20 84

FATHER PETREK
Yes The Germans have announced
this Preparations are under way
for a state funeral The body is to
be sent back to Berlin

Finding those responsible for this
act may be occupying the Reich more
than winning the war at the present
time

between them They got Heydrich eventually

INT TRAIN BOX CAR - NIGHT 110

Yesterday the Germans went to a
village to the north-west of Prague

These are dangerous times Mere
gossip wipes a whole village from
the face of the earth

(beat)
Today Karl Frank issued an amnesty
broadcast A full pardon for any
person and their family in exchange
for any information known about the
assassins Even if they did not
come forward before But there is a
deadline of five days after that
they plan to execute 30000 Czechs

JAN
This must stop

OPALKA
And what do you propose

JAN
Josef and I will go to a park
Place placards around our necks
saying we killed Heydrich
(beat)
--and commit suicide

OPALKA
This is stupid talk Stupid talk
As soldiers it is your duty to stay
alive and continue fighting Do you
understand that I will not hear
such stupid talk again

JOSEF and JAN are chastened

FATHER PETREK
The responsibility does not rest
with you We know who is
responsible They will have to
answereventually And they will

beat

If I didn’t believe that I would
not be here now

INT CATHEDRAL BALCONY - DAY

JOSEF and VALCIK sit up in the balcony on guard duty

ANTHROPOID V20

JAN thinks for a minute and anger flits across his face

There is a physical reaction from the men to this suggestion
and OPALKA steps forward

JOSEF takes the photo of LENKA from his wallet and looks at
it Deep from within the crypt the faint sounds of stone
being chiselled by a hammer

JOSEF wipes the photo clean with his thumb when the sound of
a truck suddenly makes him look out onto the street

A German army truck pulls up and several soldiers jump out

INT CATHEDRAL CRYPT - DAY 105
In the crypt OPALKA and BUBLIK hammer away at the masonry
Thousands of hammer and chisel blows scarcely make an
impression on the hard masonry

JAN is up a ladder He peers out of the slit that leads to
the street

JAN’s POV German truck and several soldiers walking towards
the church

JAN signals to OPALKA and BUBLIK to stop work

JAN looks back to the street The German soldiers make their
way into the church

INT CATHEDRAL CRYPT - DAY 109

in the truck A few more soldiers who had been searching
across the street return as well All board the truck that
starts up and drives off

EXTREME CLOSE UP of a mans face He is HANS MULLER A German
who speaks Czech He wears glasses and a piece of paper is
reflected in them

ANTHROPOID V20 88

NOTE THE CAMERA NEVER LEAVES HIS FACE

MULLER
You say you know the men who
assassinated Reichsprotektor
Reinhard Heydrich but you did not
take part in it

He looks up and OFF SCREEN to give a signal and looks back
down the report As he continues to read we hear footsteps
and then someone being punched to the floor a chair crashes
to the floor and we hear the person being kicked

MULLER
You say you don’t know where they
are but you know the family who
sheltered them

The sound of the man being lifted back on the chair coughing
and spluttering

Same as before he looks up and OFF SCREEN to give a signal
and looks back down the report As he continues to read we
hear footsteps and then someone being punched to the floor
a chair crashes to the floor and we hear the person being
kicked

MULLER
You say don’t know where they are
but you know the family who
sheltered them

The sound of the man being lifted back on the chair

MULLER
(Looking at the person)

You walked in here on your own
accord to give us this statement
(reading from the report)

You say you are a true patriot and
the reason for doing that is
because you want to protect your
family and for the killing of
innocent Czechs to stop

We finally cut to the reverse and we see a man sitting
opposite the desk with his head bowed He slowly starts to
raise his head as the CAMERA PUSHES IN
MULLER
And you say your name is Karel
Curda

CURDA looks up his face beaten and swollen He nods

MR MORAVEC stops for a second in front of his wife An
accusing stare on his face

MRS MORAVEC meets his gaze but can’t hold it for long With
tears in her eyes she looks away

MR MORAVEC is pushed and they are lined up facing the wall
with their hands in the air

A man in his late forties is brought in from outside He
removes his hat as a sign of respect His name is Josef

and gagged with his own belt

FLEISCHER
(to the other officers)
Stehen sie auf
MRS MORAVEC is pulled up by two officers

MRS MORAVEC’s nose is broken Rivulets of dark blood pour
down and off her chin

situation

MRS MORAVEC
(holding her mouth blood
flowing)

the ground with a gurgling moan

CHULUPSKY is physically upset by what he is witnessing

FLEISCHER points at the officers to get MRS MORAVEC back up
on her feet

ATA struggles against the men that hold him Tears stream
His mouth open but his vocal chords are paralyzed

Two officers help MRS MORAVEC up again

MRS MORAVEC stands facing FLEISCHER but seems to be looking
right through him

OS The trickling sound of water hitting a wood floor
FLEISCHER looks down

MRS MORAVEC is relieving her bladder A dark patch has spread
in the front of her dress and splashes on the wooden floor
between her legs

FLEISCHER stares at her in disgust

MRS MORAVEC hurriedly enters and throws the lock on the door
She reaches into the front pockets of her pinafore and pulls
out a small wooden carving of a German SS officer and a glass
capsule of cyanide

eyes She holds her hands together and says a very brief
prayer and then crosses her chest

voices The hushed voices are coming from within the church

Now a MS of ATA in his cell dressed in his Sunday best
playing a part of Bartok’s ‘Violin Concerto No 2’ He is
immersed in an angelic light

There is a passage in the concerto ATA cannot get right He
keeps hitting the wrong note a jarring almost discordant
wrong note that becomes louder and more frequent until it
turns into a never ending scream

ATA looks across the cell and sees himself strapped to a
heavy wooden chair The screaming coming from his open mouth

His face is bloody from the beatings and one eye is swollen
shut the other bloodshot and streaming

ANTHROPOID V20 96
The TORTURER punches him and two men then force brandy down

his throat using a funnel and rubber tube

You like to play the violin

The torture smashes ATA’s left hand three or four times

A German doctor appears He holds up a large hypodermic
syringe ATA is injected

A bucket of cold water then is thrown over him

ATA has been broken both physically and mentally He is
who he was

Maybe you would like to see your
mother again

lowered down on rope

soldier in the knee-caps

The soldier screams and is quickly hauled up by his comrades

The voice of PANNWITZ is then heard through a flagstone
opening

street

Firemen bring hoses and spot lights are placed to shine light
into the crypt

150E INT CATHEDRAL CRYPT - MORNING 150E

A large fireman’s hose is then thrown through the vent of the
crypt and gallons of water are pumped in

JOSEF climbs the ladder and struggles with the hose He
manages to push it out back on to the street

SVARC and HRUBY take up the tools and furiously attack the
masonry hoping they can break through to the sewer
CLANGCLANGCLANG

JOSEF turns just in time to see a grappling hook catch the
ladder by the slit high up on the wall at the end

JOSEF jumps to grab hold of the ladder but is too late and
the ladder is yanked out through the slit to the street

There is no way now to stop the gallons of water pouring into
the crypt

ANTHROPOID V20 108

The fireman’s hose is put through the slit again and water
gushes into the crypt again

Gallons of water pour into the crypt

HRUBY and SVARC continue feverishly hammering at the masonry
Water rises and washes over a burning candle extinguishing
its flame

The Germans chisel detonators into the concrete slab and reel
the trigger wire away to a safe distance

150G INT CATHEDRAL CRYPT - MORNING 150G

JOSEF wades towards the SVARC and HRUBY when suddenly there
is a very loud explosion at the back of the crypt and the
shock wave throws JOSEF into the now deep water

Brief underwater shot and the SOUND FADES AWAY

NOTE THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE PLAYS OUT TO A HAUNTING PIECE
OF PIANO MUSIC NO PRODUCTION SOUND IS HEARD THE FOLLOWING
SHOTS ARE HAND-HELD AND WILL CONVEY THE DRAMA AND IMMEDIACY
OF THE SITUATION

JOSEF comes up for air and turns A cloud of dust envelops
the crypt

The Germans have blasted a bricked-up entrance at the back
top part of the crypt Underneath the blast hole are stone
steps leading down into the crypt

HRUBY and SVARC continue feverishly hammering at the masonry

HRUBY stops chiselling the masonry and turns to face JOSEF
and VALCIK

JOSEF and VALCIK look over at HRUBY

HRUBY’s face soaking wet void of hope He shakes his head
There is no escape into to the sewers It’s hopeless

VALCIK throws a spare pistol at HRUBY

ANTHROPOID V20 109
HRUBY catches it cocks it
SVARC takes his pistol from his belt and clocks it

They all turn to the steps that lead up to the blast hole and
take up defensive positions

Two German soldiers run down the stone stairs into the crypt
JOSEF wades forward and fires his pistols twice

A hand-grenade is thrown into the crypt and falls into the
waist-level water at the bottom of the steps It explodes
The water absorbs most of the blast but a massive plume of
water is thrown up drenching the men

Two more German soldiers come down the steps

VALCIK opens fire killing them but the Sten gun clicks empty
He throws it into the water and takes his pistol from his
belt

Another grenade hits the water

The men take cover The water explodes upwards

Another German takes the stairs down into the crypt

HRUBY fires till his gun clicks empty

JOSEF shakes his head in resignation and takes the single

bullet from his breast pocket He holds his open palm
outstretched toward the other three men

They all take a single round from their pockets They come
together Four palms each open with a bullet

JOSEF clenches his fist around the bullet The others do the
same The four fists are an eloquent symbol of strength and
resistance

The chambers of the weapons are loaded and clocked

They smile sadly Then all four place the guns to their
temples

Close up of JOSEF

A German has got down the first two steps and fires his
machine gun at them

Two are slightly hit but then shoot themselves so there is no
chance of being taken alive

BANG BANG BANG

In the cross-fire HRUBY VALCIK and SVARC fall into the
water

Close up of JOSEF the gun at his temple - looking straight
ahead

ANTHROPOID V20 110
A split second of silence

FLASH FRAMES of the back of LENKA’s head Hair gently blowing
in the wind CAMERA Slowly tracks in to her

LENKA’s dead hand hangs limp Blood dripping from the
fingertips

JOSEF’s POV LENKA standing opposite him Wet pale angelic
Up to her waist in water A white lace dress hugs her elegant
figure and flows in the water around her

She smiles

Close up of JOSEF’s eyes They seem to briefly smile

BANG

The water from the hose continues to pour into the crypt
The German soldiers walk down the steps guns at the ready

The bodies of JOSEF VALCIK HRUBY and SVARC float in the
swirling waters

Close up of the PHOTO of LENKA floating on the surface of the
water It swirls around with other floating debris until it
sinks below the surface and fades from view in the darkness
