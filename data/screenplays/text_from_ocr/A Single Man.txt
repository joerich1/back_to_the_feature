BLACK SCREEN
EXT UNDERWATER

Our black screen slowly fades to a murky blue-grey as it
becomes apparent that we are underwater From the top of our
screen drifts the nude body of a man arms outstretched
sinking slowly He moves his legs in a slight struggle as he
is pulled deeper and deeper into the water His hand lashes
out in a final sudden movement as his body becomes still

We are now close in on the man’s face to reveal GEORGE 52
as he begins to toss and turn violently in the water
searching for air

A title appears over our image in simple bold type
FRIDAY NOVEMBER 30 1962

CUT TO
EXT SNOW COVERED ROAD DUSK

George is walking in the snow He is on a quiet stretch of
road and the snow is falling gently All is silent Ahead of
George and in our line of sight is a crushed car that has
flipped over on it’s top There is broken glass everywhere
and the skid marks of the car are visible on the icy road
The taillights are still on and there is steam coming from
the hood A body is hanging out of a smashed window on the
drivers side of the car

CUT TO
EXT UNDERWATER

George continues to toss and turn underwater even more
violently as he struggles to find air

CUT TO
EXT SNOWY ROAD DUSK
Arriving at the wreck George looks at the bloody face of
the dead driver - it is a handsome man in his mid thirties

JIM There is a lifeless and bloody black and white dog on
the dashboard against the broken windshield

George slowly lies down in the snow next to Jim He stares
at Jim’s bloody face and then leans over and kisses Jim on
the mouth George pulls back

Jim’s open eyes and blood covered face fill our screen as we
push in tighter His eyes have a cold gelatinous feel about
them We continue to push in until his eyes fill our screen
There is a faint repetitive banging sound like a drum
beat in the background that becomes increasingly louder

CUT TO
INT GEORGE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM MORNING 1962

George bolts up in a panic He can’t breathe He is sweating

The drumbeat sound is loud and constant In the distance we
hear a female voice

MRS STRUNK (0S)
Jennifer stop it Stop that banging
now

The banging sound stops

We hear the white noise hum of waves crashing in the
distance and the faint sound of seagulls

George’s face fills our screen as he recovers from the dream

GEORGE VO
Waking up begins with saying am and
now

We gradually pull back from above to reveal a full length
George He does not look his age - a slim tan Englishman
who has clearly taken care of himself He has a full head
of salt and pepper hair He is handsome

QUICK CUTS OF A COMPLETELY STILL GEORGE FROM ALL SIDES AND
ANGLES

He is nude lying on a bed partially covered in wrinkled

white cotton sheets There is a large black stain and an ink
pen on the sheets next to him

FROM THE CEILING WE PUSH IN SLOWLY UNTIL WE ARE JUST OVER
GEORGE WE SETTLE IN ON HIS FACE WE ARE INTIMATE WITH HIM
AND CAN HEAR HIM BREATHING SOFTLY

A twitch of his left hand A worn gold signet ring on the
little finger

George reaches over to the other side of the bed as if
searching for someone There is an open fountain pen on this
side of the bed with a small stack of stationery The ink
pen has left an enormous black stain on the sheets Some of
the ink comes off on his fingers

He gains his bearings and catches his breath He lifts his
fingers to his lips The ink leaves a slight mark on his
mouth He lies still for a moment

FLASHBACK OF GEORGE KISSING JIM IN THE SNOW

CUT TO
INT GEORGE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM MORNING 1962 -- CONTINUOUS

GEORGE VO
For the past eight months waking up
has actually hurt The cold
realization that I am still here
slowly sets in

George with bed hair still sweating untangles himself
from the sheets and sits up He holds onto his head as if in
pain

A pile of clothes is in the chair next to the bed Books and
magazines are loosely stacked next to the end table There
is an empty scotch bottle on the floor The room is dark and
in disarray

On the floor on George’s side of the bed are about 10
carefully addressed envelopes and letters laid out in a
grid

George looks at the alarm clock It has stopped at 457 He
looks at his wrist watch on the bedside table 722

George sighs and bangs the alarm clock a few times on the
table top winds it and resets it The second hand is now
ticking loudly

GEORGE VO (CONTD)
I was never terribly fond of waking

up

He rises navigates the grid of letters and walks to the
bathroom

INT GEORGE’S HOUSE - BATHROOM MORNING -- CONTINUOUS

A SERIES OF SHOTS

Relieving himself at the toilet

Standing in the shower letting the hot water wash over him

GEORGE VO
I was never one to jump out of bed
and greet the day with a smile like
Jim was

Shaving

GEORGE VO (CONTD)
I used to want to punch him
sometimes in the morning he was so

happy
Taking a handful of aspirin

GEORGE VO (CONTD)
I always used to tell him that only
fools greet the day with a smile
that only fools could possibly
escape the simple truth that now
isn’t simply now it’s a cold
reminder One day later than
yesterday one year later than last
year and that sooner or later it
will come
Scrubbing his fingernails briskly with a brush

GEORGE VO (CONTD)
He used to laugh at me and then
give me a kiss on the cheek

INT GEORGE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM MORNING -- MINUTES LATER

Opening an extremely organized drawer and taking out a pair
of perfectly folded black socks

GEORGE VO
It takes time in the morning for me
to become George time to adjust to
what is expected of George and how
he is to behave

Opening another equally organized drawer and pulling out an
immaculately pressed and folded white shirt

GEORGE VO (CONTD)
By the time I have dressed and put
the final layer of polish on the
now slightly stiff but quite
perfect George I know fully what
part I’m supposed to play

George runs a brush over his shoes
He dabs the back of his neck with cologne
END SERIES OF SHOTS

Standing at his dresser George adjusts his tie and looks
at himself intently in the mirror as our camera glides up
George’s body to his face to reveal the now fully realized
public face of George

GEORGE VO (CONTD)
Looking in the mirror staring back
at me isn’t so much a face as the
expression of a predicament

GEORGE
(whispering aloud to himself)
Just get through the goddamn day
GEORGE VO
A bit melodramatic I guess

INT GEORGE’S HOUSE - HALLWAY MORNING -- CONTINUOUS

George walks down the hallway As he approaches the living
room he glances out the window and sees JIM

GEORGE VO
But then again my heart has been
broken

JIM 34 handsome and well built in a classical American way
is waxing a surfboard on a pair of saw horses Two more
surfboards lie on the bright green lawn behind him A black
and white smooth fox terrier like the dead dog in the car
lies in the sun on his side next to Jim Another smaller
but identical dog is biting at the collar of the first dog
Jim is disciplining the smaller dog

GEORGE VO (CONTD)
I feel as If I am sinking
drowning can’t breathe

George stares back at Jim but his expression is suddenly
changed by a sharp pain that grips his chest

He holds onto the louvered rail that separates the hall from
the living room to avoid falling over He stands still and
takes a deep breath

When the pain passes he looks back out of the window No
surfboards No Jim No dogs Just a brown over-grown lawn

George closes his eyes and takes a deep breath
He makes his way down the hallway and into the kitchen
INT GEORGE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN MORNING -- CONTINUOUS

George plugs in the toaster and opens the bread box No
bread He opens the refrigerator No bread He opens the
freezer to find a loaf of white bread frozen solid He drops
the bread on the counter with a thud Irritated he bangs the
bread several times on the kitchen counter He abandons the
loaf of bread and begins making himself a pot of coffee

INT GEORGE’S HOUSE - DINING AREA MORNING -- MINUTES LATER

George is seated at the table having his morning coffee as
the phone rings George looks at his watch 740 He looks
back at the ringing phone and decides not to answer it

FLASHBACK - INT GEORGES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM DAY George and Jim are standing in the completely new and
absolutely empty house for the first time It is stunning
The starkness of it then is a total contrast to the house of
today This is the house before it had a life

GEORGE
Arent you going to say something

JIM
Are you kidding It’s spectacular

George is quietly staring at Jim with a faint smile on his
face Jim smiles when he realizes this then slips up close
to George and moves toward him for a kiss

GEORGE
What are you doing

George pushes him away Nervously looking out of the large
plate glass window

GEORGE (CONTD)
Jim stop it I don’t think you’re
quite ready for life in a glass
house

JIM
Drapes old man

Jim moves in for a kiss only to be held back by George
JIM (CONTD)
You’re the one who’s always saying

that we’re invisible

GEORGE
That’s not exactly what I meant
George gives in and the two men begin to kiss
END FLASHBACK

WE PULL BACK to reveal George alone in the house across the
dining area and living room and out the pivoting glass doors
and across the dead lawn George’s house is modest in size
yet has dynamic lines It is an example of very bold
architecture circa 1948 that has become somewhat ramshackle
over time We take in the full view of George in his world
as the phone continues to ring

SERIES OF SHOTS
George’s empty bedroom as the phone continues to ring
Surfboards leaning against a wall in the garage

Books and architectural models on the living room shelves
next to a drafting table

END SERIES OF SHOTS

We cut back to George staring into space for several beats
as the phone continues to ring

GEORGE VO
For the first time in my life I
can’t see my future Every day goes
by in a haze but today I have
decided will be different

INT GEORGE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM MORNING -- MINUTES LATER

As George stands in front of his book case the phone starts
to ring again George looks across the room at the phone
which sits on a small table next to an upholstered club
chair

GEORGE VO
Finally You know it has been
raining here all day and I’ve been
trapped in this house waiting for
you to call

CUT TO

HAROLD (0S)
Goodbye Mr Falconer

George replaces the receiver As he does it misses the
cradle and falls to the floor the dial tone continues to
hum

He sits looking blankly ahead in total disbelief He doesn’t
know what to do He slides down in the chair and begins to
cry silently as the reality of what has happened sets in He
suddenly jumps up runs out of the room down the hall and
to the front door

uncontrollably

END FLASHBACK
INT GEORGE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM MORNING -- 1962

The phone rings once more and then stops George looks back
to the bookcase

He grabs a Huxley novel and retreats to the bathroom

INT GEORGE’S HOUSE - BATHROOM MORNING -- CONTINUOUS
Sitting on the toilet George reads

There is a constant banging from outside This is the same
banging we heard earlier George attempts to ignore the
irritating sound but finds it impossible to concentrate and
slams his book shut He looks across the street The window
is positioned so that when on the toilet George can see out
but only his head can be seen from outside

EXT THE STRUNK HOUSE MORNING -- CONTINUOUS

WE SEE THE STRUNK FAMILY BUT DO NOT HEAR WHAT THEY ARE
SAYING

The Strunk house is a pristine absolutely new ranch house

with a manicured lawn that reeks of the traditional American
dream circa 1962

JENNIFER STRUNK 8 a blonde very American little girl
hammer in hand pulverizes an old bathroom scale that she’s
pulled out of one of the shiny new trash cans She tightly
clutches a white Persian kitten with a pink ribbon Jennifer
is wearing a gingham dress and she chants an annoying
advertising jingle over and over in monotone as she pounds
away at the scale with the hammer

MRS STRUNK 32 appears in the doorway She is the archetype
of the young attractive suburban wife and mother

She is usually calm and poised but today she is clearly
exasperated and yells from the front door at her daughter to
put the scale back in the trash can

Jennifer ignores her mother and continues pounding away with
increasing violence

Meanwhile Jennifers oldest brother TOM 9 is combing over
their lawn with a metal detector as a younger brother
CHRISTOPHER 5 digs ferociously at the lawn with a small
garden shovel The metal detector suddenly shrieks having
located something

Jennifer drops her cat runs to her brothers and joins in
the digging

The lawn is littered with newly excavated holes and the
flower beds also seem to be in a freshly unearthed state as
if a dog has been digging in them Simply put the normally
perfect front yard is an absolute disaster area

The three children start screaming loudly to their mother

Mrs Strunk rushes over to the hole to see As the metal

detector shrieks again the children scream and even Mrs
Strunk squeals with delight and gets down on her knees to
dig

CLOSE UP SHOTS FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES OF THE CHILDREN DIGGING
FEROCIOUSLY FOR THE MONEY

WE CUT BACK TO GEORGE AS HE WATCHES THE STRUNK FAMILY

MR STRUNK 35 a well dressed young executive with briefcase
in hand comes out of the house shouting at his family

His wife rushes over to him but cannot pacify him as Mr
Strunk surveys the destroyed lawn and flower beds

SHOT FROM A LOW VANTAGE POINT WITH CHRISTOPHER IN THE
FOREGROUND CATCHING A BUTTERFLY ON A FLOWER

The Strunks continue to argue as Mr Strunk brushes off his
wifes attempts at affection

BACK ON THE LOW SHOT OF CHRISTOPHER NOW HOLDING THE REMNANTS
OF THE BUTTERFLY IN HIS HAND

Mrs Strunk leans forward and kisses her husband on the
cheek as he walks towards his car

Mrs Strunk heads over to the battered scale and throws it
in the trash can

As she does she looks across the street at George’s window
to catch him staring back at her She begins to wave

INT GEORGE’S HOUSE - BATHROOM MORNING -- CONTINUOUS

Embarrassed George ducks forward to hide from view As he
does the phone starts ringing again

He sits still for a moment He sighs Finally realizing that
the phone will not stop ringing he gets up His pants are
still around his ankles as he shuffles out into the bedroom
to answer the phone

INT GEORGE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM MORNING -- CONTINUOUS

GEORGE
Hello Charley

BRITISH WOMAN (0S)
How did you know it was me

INT CHARLEY’S HOUSE - BEDROOM MORNING -- CONTINUOUS

We cut to a shot of CHARLEY 48 in her bed smoking a
cigarette Her bedside table is cluttered with pill bottles
and what is left of a cocktail Her ashtray is filled with
cigarette butts and magazines are strewn around her in the
bed Strawberry blonde and fair Charley was clearly once a
great beauty but is now a lonely and manic alcoholic
Charley is at the age where beauty hangs by a thread On a
good day she can still manage a striking appearance yet good
days are few and far between Today is not a good day

GEORGE (0S)
Charlotte no one else ever calls
me before 800 in the morning

CHARLEY
I didn’t call too early did I You
sound grumpy

GEORGE (0S)
No I just have a headache I was
going to call you actually Is it
too late to change my mind about
tonight

CHARLEY
Of course not I haven’t seen you
all week I’m dying for a dose of
you

GEORGE (0S)
I know I’m sorry So great I’ll
see you tonight I need to run
though I’m late for work I’ll
call you later from school

CHARLEY
Ill see you tonight

GEORGE (0S)
Good-bye kiddo

CHARLEY
Bye old man

We linger on Charley as she hangs up the phone We see the
joy in her face She has a reason to live She takes a long

deep drag of her cigarette then stubs it out and throws
herself back against her bed pillows

INT GEORGE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM MORNING -- MINUTES LATER

George now fully dressed with his jacket and eyeglasses on
goes to his desk and unlocks a drawer He carefully lifts
out an object and places it on his desk We see clearly that
the object is a gun He picks it up flicks open the revolver
and turns it up in the air to empty the bullets There are
no bullets George sighs clicks the gun closed and places
it in his briefcase He then shoves a stack of papers into
the briefcase along with the Huxley book and heads out the
door to the hall

INT GEORGE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM MORNING -- CONTINUOUS

George is coming down the hall As he rushes toward the
front door he practically knocks over his cleaning woman
ALVA arriving with a bag of groceries and the newspaper
under her arm Alva is a kind Hispanic woman in her mid
40s

ALVA
Good morning Mr George

Alva places the bag of groceries on the dining table

ALVA (CONTD)
Sir you don’t look so good Did
you not sleep again

GEORGE
Good morning Alva No I didn’t
sleep well You forgot to take the
bread out of the freezer

ALVA
It stays fresh that way

GEORGE
It was a little too fresh this
morning There are some papers laid
out on my desk that need to stay
(MORE )

GEORGE (CONTD)
there so please don’t move them
And my pen leaked all over the bed
I’m sorry about the sheets

ALVA
It’s OK sir

GEORGE
Alva

ALVA
Yes sir

GEORGE

Thank you You’re wonderful

Georges crosses to the table and kisses Alva on the cheek
She is stunned George turns and leaves the house as Alva
stares after him as though he is from Mars

EXT GEORGE’S HOUSE MORNING -- MINUTES LATER

George backs his car down his driveway and into the street
The clock on the dash reads 804

Our camera speed slows as we see Jennifer tap dancing in the
driveway Jennifer looks at George in a slightly provocative

manner and tugs on her dress as he drives past

Christopher aims a toy machine gun directly at George’s car
and fires to squeals of laughter

George stares Christopher directly in the eye and holds up
his hand in a mock gun fashion and mouths “Bang bang” to
the boy stopping Christopher dead in his tracks

George waves at Mrs Strunk still on her lawn watching the
children play as Tom walks towards the street with an arm
full of school books

She waves back - a warm smile - as George eases his car past
the Strunk house

EXT SAN TOMAS COLLEGE - PARKING LOT DAY -- LATER

George pulls into the faculty parking lot of the school His
radio is on as he waits for three female students to pass in
front of his car

RADIO ANNOUNCER (0S)
Premier Nikita Krushchev said today
that the Soviet Union’s policy of
peaceful coexistence averted a
nuclear war over Cuba Krushchev
declared that the missiles in Cuba
were ready for launching but not
used sparing the world froma
nuclear holocaust

He pulls into a parking space and turns off the car George
closes his eyes and breathes deeply several times He looks
at himself in the rear view mirror smooths his hair with
his hand and straightens his tie He grabs his briefcase
and gets out of his car

George makes his way through a sea of students and faculty
like a salmon swimming upstream

We cut to George continuing his walk as a lawn filled with
students stretches out in front of him

George notices a young couple lying together on the grass

KENNY 20 is a 3rd year student He has dark brown hair
pale skin and piercing blue eyes Kenny is not classically
handsome yet is attractive in a somewhat gangly way LOIS
20 is a stunning and very stylish blonde girl with a bored
beatnik feel to her manner

Catching a glimpse of George Kenny’s eyes light up We hang
on this for a moment as Kenny’s hand shoots up in an
enthusiastic wave Turning to see George Lois offers
nothing but a nod and an exhale of cigarette smoke George
waves back tentatively

George’s eyes linger on Kenny who is staring at him intently

Kenny stares after George while Lois reclines and continues

to smoke
Reaching the Arts Building George heads inside

INT SAN TOMAS COLLEGE - OFFICE OF THE ENGLISH DEPARTMENT —
DAY -- MOMENTS LATER

George walks past two secretaries One is quite a beautiful
blonde in her early twenties

BLONDE SECRETARY
Good morning professor

GEORGE
Good morning

BLONDE SECRETARY
Oh professor Falconer

GEORGE
Yes

BLONDE SECRETARY
There was a student here this
morning asking for your address

GEORGE
My address What was his name

BLONDE SECRETARY
He didn’t say sir and I’m sorry
but I didn’t ask him He said he’s
in one of your classes this term

We linger on George’s face a moment He is intrigued by this

GEORGE
Did you give it to him

BLONDE SECRETARY
(nervous)
Yes sir I did I hope that’s OK I
realize I probably shouldn’t have
but he was very nice and before I
knew it

George looks the girl up and down

OUR SCREEN IS FILLED WITH CLOSE UP SHOTS OF THE SECRETARYS
FACE AND HAIR

George is taking in her beauty He looks her dead in the
eyes

GEORGE
Your hair looks great up like that

BLONDE SECRETARY
What

GEORGE
I said your hair looks great like
that It suits you You always look
so beautiful Really fresh You
have such a lovely smile

George breathes in

GEORGE (CONTD)
Arpege

BLONDE SECRETARY
Sir

GEORGE
Really beautiful

George walks away The Blonde Secretary looks back at the
other girl clearly dumbfounded at George’s manner

INT SAN TOMAS COLLEGE - FACULTY LOUNGE DAY MOMENTS LATER
George enters the room and makes an effort to avoid eye
contact with anyone An older professor DON who is reading

the paper looks up and smiles at George

GEORGE
Good morning Don

DON
Good morning George

The large wall clock reads 910 There are two vending
machines against one wall of the lounge

George grabs a cup of coffee from the coffee machine and
gets a Hershey’s bar from the candy machine George puts
more change into the machine and gets a second candy bar As
he does GRANT a tall young professor slips next to George
and presses the button on the coffee machine

GRANT
Good morning George

GEORGE
Good morning Grant

George grabs his second candy bar and heads out the door as
Grant follows

GRANT
You look awful What have you been
doing

The two men exit the building and begin walking
EXT SAN TOMAS COLLEGE - CAMPUS DAY -- CONTINUOUS
The sky is a dark brown haze

George eats his candy bar gently steering them towards the
tennis courts

GEORGE
Look around Grant most of these
students aspire to nothing more
than a corporate job and a desire
to raise coke-drinking TV-watching
children who as soon as they can
speak start chanting TV jingles and
smashing things with hammers

GRANT
You’re really scaring me today
George

GEORGE
I sometimes find them staring at me
in a kind of bovine stupor as if I
were lecturing in a foreign
language Remind me why we
shouldn’t all just be annihilated

George scans the tennis courts out of the corner of his
eye Only one court is occupied by two young men playing
singles

The sun comes out with a sudden fierce heat that cuts through
the yellow smog-haze The players are shirtless

CLOSE-UP SHOTS OF THE PLAYERS OUR SOUND FADES TO ONLY THE
AMPLIFIED SOUND OF THE GAME SOUNDS OF THE BALL HITTING THE
RACQUET AND OF THE FEET OF THE PLAYERS SLIDING ON THE RED
CLAY COURT AND OF THEIR SIGHS AND QUICK BREATHING AS THEY
WHACK THE BALL BACK AND FORTH

George clocks this intently and takes in every detail

OUR SOUND RETURNS WITH A WHACK OF THE BALL AND A GUTTURAL
OUTCRY FROM ONE OF THE PLAYERS

The stream of sunlight has passed and the sky is once again
dull and flat

George realizes that Grant is talking and has been talking

George has a faint smile on his face still gazing at the
players

GRANT
You seem to think this is alla
joke We’re living in a world where
nuclear war is a real threat I
don’t understand how you can’t be
concerned

GEORGE
You’re serious aren’t you

GRANT
Yes I’m serious George did you
(MORE )
GRANT (CONTD)
even read the article that I gave
you on bomb shelters Ours is
almost done We had 3 different
contractors work on it so none of
them know what we’ve got then
were having the outside of it
landscaped so no one will know it’s
there

GEORGE
Really

CUT TO

A SHOT OF GRANT AND HIS FAMILY IN A SIMPLE CONCRETE BLOCK
SHELTER STARING DEAD INTO OUR CAMERA AS IF POSING FOR A
PORTRAIT GRANT IS SMOKING A PIPE AND THE FAMILY ARE
WEARING THEIR SUNDAY BEST THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY ANIMALS
A GOAT CHICKENS ETC

CUT BACK TO

GRANT
If word gets out that you’ve got a
better shelter then everyone will
try to get in when something
happens

GEORGE
And so

GRANT
There will be no time for sentiment
when the Russians fire a missile at
us

GEORGE
If it’s going to be a world with no
time for sentiment Grant it’s not
a world that I want to live in

One of our tennis players lets out a loud THWACK

INT SAN TOMAS COLLEGE - GEORGES OFFICE DAY

George is sitting on the edge of his desk Frozen He has a
look of extreme melancholy on his face His shoulders are

slumped

He waits for the clock to strike 1000 exactly and then he
stands picks up his briefcase and heads out the door

INT SAN TOMAS COLLEGE - GEORGES CLASS -- MINUTES LATER

George walks into class and places his briefcase on the
desk Most of the students continue to talk

George sits on the edge of the desk and reaches into his
briefcase He fumbles around for a moment pauses and then
pulls out a book He sits quietly with a slight look of
disgust on his face staring directly at the talkers as one
by one they succumb to his silence

Finally George speaks

GEORGE
“After Many a Summer Dies the Swan”

Blank stares

GEORGE (CONTD)
I trust you’ve all read the Huxley
novel I assigned almost three weeks
ago How does the title relate to
our story

He looks around the room as a few hands go up

GEORGE (CONTD)
Yes Mr Mong

ALEX MONG
It doesn’t It’s about this rich
guy who’s afraid he’s too old for
this girl

George irritated by the response of Mr Mong closes his
eyes tightly and takes a deep breath as our sound fades

CUT TO

FLASHBACK - EXT UNDERWATER

George is tossing and turning underwater struggling to
breathe He turns over and over trying to find the surface of
the water but he continues to sink

CUT BACK TO
INT SAN TOMAS COLLEGE - GEORGES CLASS -- MOMENTS LATER

Our sound returns as George opens his eyes and snaps back to
the present Laughter dies away The only one not laughing
is Kenny who is watching George intently George remains
frozen for a moment as RUSS raises his hand

GEORGE
Russ

George signals for Russ to speak

Our camera speed slows and our sound fades as George seems
mesmerized by the blank eyes of Lois Lois is smoking and
staring straight back at George in an almost aggressive
manner She begins to whisper into Kenny’s ear Kenny
continues to watch George who has a dazed expression on his
face

George slowly regains his composure and comes to attention
as MYRON - a dark-complexioned young man with intense eyes
and glasses- raises his hand

OUR SOUND RETURNS

GEORGE (CONTD)
Yes Mr Hirsch

MYRON
Sir on page 79 Mr Propter says
that the stupidest text in the
Bible is “they hated me without a
cause Does he mean the Nazis were
right to hate the Jews Is Huxley
an anti-Semite

GEORGE
No

The class stares at George expecting more from such a
provocative question

GEORGE (CONTD)
No Mr Huxley is not an anti
Semite The Nazis were obviously
wrong to hate the Jews But their
hating the Jews was not without a

cause But the cause wasn’t real
The cause was imagined The cause
was FEAR

Curious stares

GEORGE (CONTD)
Let’s leave the Jews out of this
for a moment and think of another
minority One that can go unnoticed
if it needs to

George looks directly at WALTER a slightly effeminate young
man who turns away embarrassed

GEORGE (CONTD)
There are all sorts of minorities
blondes for example but a minority
is only thought of as one when it
constitutes some kind of threat to
the majority A real threat or an
imagined one And therein lies the
FEAR And if the minority is
somehow invisible

Another glance at Walter

GEORGE (CONTD)
»the fear is even greater

Kenny tries to find the target of George’s glance but to no
avail

GEORGE (CONTD)
And this FEAR is the reason the

GEORGE (CONTD)
always is a cause And the cause is
FEAR Minorities are just people
People

Again a subtle look at Walter

GEORGE (CONTD)
-like us

Walter shrinks in his seat

GEORGE (CONTD)
I can see that I’ve lost you a bit
You know what Let’s forget about
Huxley today

George places his book on his desk Several students look up
from their notebooks

GEORGE (CONTD)
Let’s just talk about fear Fear
after all is our real enemy Fear
is taking over our world Fear is
being used as a tool of
manipulation in our society
It’s how politicians peddle policy
and how Madison Avenue sells us
things that we don’t need Think
about it Fear that we’re going to
be attacked fear that there are
communists lurking around every
corner fear that some little
Caribbean country that doesn’t
believe in our way of life poses a
threat to us Fear that black
culture may take over the world
Fear of Elvis Presley’s hips (beat)
Well maybe that one is a real
fear Fear that our bad breath
might ruin our friendships Fear
of growing old and being alone

George notices a few eyes looking over his shoulder at the
clock on the wall which reads 1205

GEORGE (CONTD)
Fear that we’re useless and that no
one cares what we have to say

Some shift about uncomfortably in their seats yet Kenny
stares amazed

George surveys the anxious class realizing he has lost
their attention

GEORGE (CONTD)
Have a good weekend

George closes his book shoves it in his briefcase and
walks out the door as his students gather their things

Kenny gets up to follow after George but Lois corners him to
talk

EXT SAN TOMAS COLLEGE - ARTS BUILDING DAY -- LATER

George is heading briskly towards the administration
building when he hears Kenny’s voice

KENNY
Sir May I speak to you for a
minute I have to go down to the
bookstore

George pauses allowing Kenny to catch up to him and then the
two men begin walking

KENNY (CONTD)
Why don’t you talk to us like that
all the time

GEORGE
I don’t think it went over very
well

KENNY

Man fear of things gets to me all
the time but you can’t talk about
it with anyone or you just sound
like a fool
GEORGE
You can’t even talk about it with

Lois

KENNY
I don’t think she’s afraid of
anything

GEORGE
Everyone’s afraid of something
Kenny

KENNY

What are you afraid of sir

GEORGE
Cars

KENNY
How can you live in Los Angeles and
be afraid of cars

GEORGE
Maybe you can’t

KENNY
Sometimes my fear of things can
almost paralyze me It’s like I get
really panic stricken and I feel
like I might explode or something
May I ask you a personal question sir

GEORGE
Of course

KENNY
Do you ever get high

George stops walking

GEORGE
How old do I look to you

KENNY
Have you ever taken any drugs sir
GEORGE
Of course Kenny

KENNY
Like what

GEORGE
I shouldn’t really be discussing
this with you on campus Mr Potter

George begins walking and Kenny follows

KENNY
It’s the only way I get by
sometimes Have you ever tried
mescaline

GEORGE
Not my drug of choice I shaved off
one of my eyebrows once on
mescaline Not a good look for me

KENNY
Sir

GEORGE
I looked in the mirror - big
mistake if you’re high on mescaline
- and decided that my eyebrows were
taking over my face and before I
knew it I had shaved one off I
wore a band-aid over my eye for
about 6 weeks while my brow grew
in Very embarrassing

KENNY
You didn’t take it again after
that
George stops
GEORGE

Kenny have you been listening to
me I shaved off my eyebrow I
wanted an experience Mr Potter
not a career on stage

KENNY
If you ever want to get high sir I
usually have some dope

GEORGE
You’re really mad aren’t you

KENNY
Sorry sir I guess you don’t feel
very comfortable talking like this

GEORGE
What makes you say that

KENNY
Lois thinks you’re kind of cagey
Like this morning when you were
listening to all that crap we were
talking about Huxley

GEORGE
Well not all of you I didn’t
notice you open your mouth once

KENNY
I was watching you

George is surprised and intrigued

KENNY (CONTD)
You let us ramble on and on and
then you straighten us out - but
you never really tell us everything
you know about something

GEORGE
Well maybe that’s true up to a
point

GEORGE (CONTD)
It’s not that I want to be cagey
I can’t really discuss things
completely openly at school
Someone would misunderstand I
tried to do that today It doesn’t
work

INT SAN TOMAS COLLEGE - CAMPUS BOOKSTORE DAY CONTINUOUS

Kenny seems to be thinking over what George has said as the
two men enter the bookstore Kenny picks up a red pencil
sharpener from a display on the counter and a note book

KENNY
What was it you wanted to get sir

GEORGE
Nothing I was on my way to the
Deans office

KENNY
You mean you walked all the way
down here just to talk to me

GEORGE
Why not

KENNY
Well I think you deserve something
for that Here sir take your pick
It’s on me

Kenny waves his hand across the multicolored display of
pencil sharpeners

GEORGE
Thank you

George chooses a yellow one

KENNY
I thought you’d probably pick blue

Kenny pays the cashier

GEORGE
Why blue

KENNY
Isn’t blue supposed to be
spiritual

GEORGE
What makes you think I’m spiritual
And you Red

KENNY
What’s red stand for

GEORGE
Lots of things Rage Lust

KENNY
No kidding

Kenny looks George straight in the eye

KENNY (CONTD)
See you around sir

Kenny smiles and walks away leaving George staring after
him

Kenny

KENNY
I was just hoping that perhaps we
could get together for a drink or
something sometime

GEORGE
And why is that

KENNY
I don’t know sir Because I think
you might like it I mean because
you seem as though you could use a
friend

GEORGE
Oh really

Yes sir you do

George looks Kenny in the eyes He is touched by Kenny’s
concern

GEORGE
Well you might be right Kenny but

intimate I guess Like you were
once together You haven’t ever
slept with her have you

GEORGE
Yes A few times when we were
young I don’t mean to say that it
didn’t mean anything to me but I’m
afraid it meant a good deal more to
Charley It was a long time ago in
London It didn’t work out very
well I love Charley and we are
very close friends but that’s all

JIM
I’m confused If you sleep with
women then why are you with me

Because I fell in love with you
Anyway doesn’t everyone sleep with
women when they’re young

JIM
I havent

GEORGE
You’re joking

JIM
No I’m not It was just never
anything that interested me

GEORGE
Well You’re awfully modern aren’t
you You know that was the first
thing that I noticed about you was
how sure of yourself you were How

George sits down on a trim upholstered sofa and starts to
look carefully through his briefcase

Into our frame come two perfect tiny blue patent leather
shoes

George looks up to see Jennifer Strunk Her beauty is
almost alarming Her blue eyes match the color of her tiny
shoes She stares at George intently

Well I think yours are pretty too

JENNIFER
Why do you look so sad Would you

around the outside and inside is a large black scorpion and
a small spider clinging to a stick

EXT LIQUOR STORE PARKING LOT LATE AFTERNOON

A giant billboard for PSYCHO featuring only Janet Leigh’s
eyes completely fills our frame as George’s car pulls into
our shot George parks and gets out of the car and walks

towards the liquor store

The sun is low in the sky and the sky is now a dirty shade
of pale orange

As George passes a late model car a dog is barking
hysterically and looking out of the driver’s side window at
George It is a smooth black and white fox terrier George
stops in his tracks approaches the car and stares in the
window as the dog becomes silent and looks George in the
eyes

Just then a YOUNG WOMAN returns to the car

YOUNG WOMAN
I’m sorry I hope she didn’t growl
at you She goes kind of crazy
sometimes when I have to leave her
in the car

The Young Woman opens her car door and pushes the dog aside
with her bag

GEORGE
She’s perfect What’s her name

The Young Woman gets inside and rolls down the window The
dog climbs onto her lap and puts her front paws on the car
door

YOUNG WOMAN

loitering near a pay phone smoking a cigarette He is very
handsome in a cheap way and locks eyes with George as George
enters the electric doors

George looks away uncomfortably

jacket pocket and pulls out a 20 dollar bill He hands it to
Carlos

George walks toward his car and starts to get in but as he
does he notices Carlos trying to open the locked passenger
door

Our shot is from the front of the car taking in the sky in
the background which has turned a vivid pink

GEORGE
What are you doing

CARLOS
Arent we going somewhere

No But thanks

Looking up at the sky George stops and stares at

CARLOS
(in Spanish)
You know it’s the smog that makes
it that color

I’ve never seen a sky like this
before

CARLOS
(in Spanish)
Sometimes awful things have their
own kind of beauty

George looks at Carlos struck by his comment

GEORGE
Could I have another cigarette

George a cigarette and places one in his own mouth strikes
a match and lights George’s cigarette and then his own

accent

GEORGE
I like your accent You speak very
well How did you learn English

CARLOS

GEORGE
Oh I’m just trying to get over an
old love I guess

CARLOS
My mother always says that lovers
are like buses You just have to
wait a little while and another one
comes along

George stubs out his cigarette

GEORGE
You have a smart mother I’ve got
to go

CARLOS

is someone to like you I’m a nice
guy you know

George goes around to the drivers side of the car and starts
to get in

The Strunk lawn is pristine flower beds immaculate and the
guests are arriving All are dressed in their best chic

cocktail outfits and the driveway is full of sleek late-

There is a beer on the floor at Jim’s end and a scotch on the
floor at George’s end

The female dog is tucked up between them and the male is
stretched out on the floor as a record ends and starts to
scratch back and forth

GEORGE
It’s your turn to change it

JIM
I’m not changing it It’s your
turn You won’t like what I put on
anyway

GEORGE
Oh please please Come on I’11l

JIM
Of course he does What a life he
has Don’t you envy him

GEORGE
Why because he gets to sniff

JIM
Nice I envy him because he just
does what he wants Like yesterday
I was standing in the front yard
and Susan came over to talk for a
minute and that little brat of
hers Christopher came running over
with that damned gun of his Well
our little dog walked right up

leg and peed all over Christopher’s
new tennis shoes And all over
Christopher actually He and his

mother both started shrieking and I
had to act like I was upset when
it was all I could do to keep from
laughing It was so perfectly
executed after all the times those
kids have tortured that poor dog I
wish you had seen it

They both laugh and look at the dog who knows that he
being spoken about

JIM (CONTD)
You should take a lesson from him
He doesn’t stay up all night
worrying He’s figured out how to
get the two of us to do exactly
what he wants They are both
basically very sophisticated little
parasites when you think about it

GEORGE
Well the dumbest creatures are the
happiest Just look at your mother

JIM
You’re an ass What I mean is he
really just lives in the moment
Like now What could be better than
this Tucked up here with you If I
died right now it would be OK

GEORGE
Well it wouldn’t be OK with me so
shut up and go change the record

at the noise from the party and puts on the record

He takes a dark suit out of the closet and lays it across
the empty end of the desk top He goes over to his dresser

ebony box on the dresser top and lays these out next to the
suit

He goes back to his closet and grabs two different ties

He stands over the suit weighing the two different tie
options He chooses one lays it on the shirt carefully and
returns the other one to the closet

He carefully writes out something in bold type on a small
piece of paper and pins it to the tie that he has laid out
with the shirt He takes a note marked “Charley” from the
desk top and lays this on top of the suit

George goes to his closet takes out a pair of black capped
toe shoes and places them on the desk next to the suit The
shoes are perfectly polished He stands back and surveys his
desk

motion of placing the gun in his mouth but this time falls
back against the wall and slides down it George yanks the
curtain open and goes out of the door and down the hall

George comes back into the bedroom with a red flannel
sleeping bag The gun is still in his hand He unrolls the
sleeping bag and places it on the bed He gets in and zips
it up over his head We can see by the shape of the sleeping
bag that he has raised the gun to his mouth Just as he does
this the phone rings George freezes for a moment then
gets out of the sleeping bag and crosses the room He places
the gun on his desk and answers the phone

GEORGE
No I did not forget the gin I’1l
see you in ten minutes

He hangs up the phone and heads down the hall

EXT GEORGE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN EVENING -- MINUTES LATER

George is standing at the kitchen counter putting the
finishing touches on a note

He is now dressed in a blazer with gold buttons grey slacks
and black loafers He has clearly made an effort to look
handsome

He folds the note around a stack of one hundred dollar bills
and puts it into an envelope He writes ALVA on the outside
of the envelope goes to the bread box and pulls out a new
loaf of bread

He opens the wrapper and slides the envelope in so that it
is visible through the plastic He closes the wrapper and
places the loaf of bread in the freezer

He grabs the liquor bottles and heads out the door
EXT GEORGE’S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER

George leaves his house and begins to walk down his driveway
The Strunk cocktail party is now in full swing and two
couples are being greeted at the front door by Mr Strunk

All of a sudden Christopher Strunk jumps out of the bushes
with his toy machine gun and starts shooting at George
George stares down at the little boy

CUT TO

Our sound fades as George slowly turns towards the boy
unzips his fly and unleashes a steady stream of piss all
over the stunned kid who starts screaming hysterically

CUT BACK TO

Our sound snaps back George is still staring at Christopher
who is shooting away George’s stare brings the little boy
to a stop

GEORGE
Christopher would you like it if I
killed you

CHRISTOPHER
I don’t know

GEORGE
Well if you keep it up we are
going to find out so go home and
stop shooting at people

Christopher glares at George

George offers a quick salutation and a broad smile to Mr
Strunk and then turns and walks up the road

EXT STAIRS TO SOLEDAD WAY NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER
George walks up the stairs with his bottles of liquor
EXT CHARLEY’S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY NIGHT

George walks towards the house He stares at the door a
moment before ringing the bell

George is stunned by the beauty of the lush pink climbing
roses next to Charley’s door He leans in to smell one and
closes his eyes

Charley opens the door

CHARLEY
Geo

OUR CAMERA DRINKS CHARLIE IN

Charley is dressed in a graphic black and white evening
dress that is clearly a few years ahead of it’s time Her
strawberry blonde shoulder-length hair is teased and piled
on her head in a stylish coif that clearly took a great deal
of time to achieve This is Charley at her best and not the
same Charley we saw earlier

She has made quite an effort and she looks beautiful She
kisses George on the cheek as they embrace

A QUICK FLASHBACK OF GEORGE SOBBING IN THE RAIN IN CHARLEYS
ARMS

Back to the present George pulls away from Charley
GEORGE
You look divine As chic as ever

George is genuinely happy to see Charley

CHARLEY
Come on in

INT CHARLEY’S HOUSE - ENTRY HALL NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

George follows Charley as they walk together through the
house

CHARLEY
Oh God It smells awfully of
cooking in here doesn’t it

GEORGE
It smells great I’m starving
Where’s Louisa

INT CHARLEY’S HOUSE - SUN ROOM NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

CHARLEY
I gave her the night off I’m
cooking myself

GEORGE
You are

CHARLEY
Yes and I’m trying something new

GEORGE
Charley darling you cooking is
new

CHARLEY

Don’t be smart I’m in a good mood
tonight and I’m going to be fun
I’ve made two early New Years
resolutions One no more talk
about awful ex-husbands and
children who don’t give a damn

GEORGE
And the other one

CHARLEY
One what

GEORGE
Resolution

CHARLEY

Oh resolution number two More
smoking and more drinking and screw
it all So come mix me up a drink
Ill have a gin and tonic please
and watch out baby

GEORGE
Coming up

INT CHARLEY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

The interior of the living room is almost all white This
is very definitely the house of a stylish woman There is a
white shag carpet on the floor a fire burning a large
curved sectional sofa in the center of the room and an
elaborate dining table set for two in a window at the far
end of the room

As they walk into the living room George turns to the well
stocked drinks table and mixes them both a drink

Charley sits down on the sofa in front of the fire

CHARLEY
It was sweet of you to come
tonight

GEORGE

Sweet had nothing to do with it I
needed to see you

CHARLEY
Oh come off it Whenever you do
something sweet you’re too ashamed
to admit it

George hands Charley her drink and sits down next to her

GEORGE
To our early New Years Resolutions

CHARLEY
And just what are your resolutions
by the way

GEORGE
To let go of the past Completely
entirely and forever

They raise their glasses and smile at each other Charley
looks George up and down

CHARLEY
Light me up Geo will you

Charley looks Geo in the eyes George leans forward for the
table lighter

CHARLEY (CONTD)
Darling you don’t look well Do
you remember when you had your
little heart attack last year

GEORGE
It wasn’t a heart attack

CHARLEY
Well whatever it was darling you
don’t look so hot

GEORGE
I’m great Never been better Just
tired I haven’t been sleeping

CHARLEY
Geo it’s normal You were with Jim
for 16 years I think about Richard
everyday too It’s hard being alone
At least you have a job and a life
(beat) Let’s have a bit of dinner shall
we Because I’ve worked so hard
INT CHARLEY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM NIGHT -- LATER
Theyve finished their dinner and a bottle of champagne

CHARLEY
Really

Charley lights another cigarette

CHARLEY (CONTD)
What are you talking about

GEORGE
Seriously “old” doesn’t exist
anymore A student yesterday called
me a “senior citizen”

CHARLEY
I wouldn’t mind if “old” didn’t
exist but I’m not sure “senior” is
what I’m shooting for either

Charley catches a reflection of herself in the glass of
the window and smooths her cheek up a bit with her well
manicured hand

GEORGE
It’s all becoming so bland it’s
not why I came to America It’s
like a complete breakdown of
culture and manners

CHARLEY
Well the young ones have no
manners The other day at the car
wash I had a young man look me up
and down and actually ask me if I
was a natural blonde

GEORGE
No What did you say

CHARLEY
I looked him straight in the eye
(MORE )

CHARLEY (CONTD)
and said “Well let’s just say
that if I stood on my head I would
be a natural brunette with lovely
breath”

GEORGE
You did not

CHARLEY
I did And the amusing thing was
that it went right over his head
They both laugh hysterically

GEORGE
You had a mouth on you even back in
London Do you remember that old
lesbian who threw her drink at you
because you asked her if she was
hung like a donut

They practically fall out of their chairs laughing at this
one Their laughing tapers off as Charley takes a drag on
her cigarette There is a quiet sweet pause between them

CHARLEY
Oh Geo we could always go back to
London The two of us

GEORGE
No thanks

CHARLEY
You know you miss it

GEORGE
Sometimes I miss it Maybe if Jim
had lived He loved England He
really wanted us to stay the last
time we were there

CHARLEY
Do you really think you would have
moved

GEORGE
Oh I don’t know It’s silly to
even talk about it It was just a
fantasy

Charley reaches over and holds his hand As she does she
fondles his little finger and notices the addition of the
slim gold band

CHARLEY
What’s this

George pulls his hand away

GEORGE
My mother’s wedding ring I found
it when I was cleaning out a
drawer Charlotte dear we are both
in need of another drink

George stands up grabs their two empty glasses and heads
back to the drinks table as Charley watches clearly still
very much in love

Charley gets up and puts on a record and then crosses the
room to where George is mixing the drinks and slides up
behind him affectionately

George smiles as Charley embraces him from behind and lays
her head on his shoulder

Much to her surprise he turns around takes her hand and
grabs her around the waist as they begin to slow dance

George buries his head in Charley’s neck and squeezes her
close We hear the sound of her bracelets and George feels
the brush of her earrings as he literally drinks her in

They are drunk and adorable together as the pace of the
music slows and George starts to pull away

Charley in an attempt to keep things going stops dancing
and runs across the room to change the record

CHARLEY
Wait wait wait Don’t move I
LOVE this

She puts on a wild record as George begins to laugh against
his will

GEORGE
You are insane

CHARLEY
Come on old man

The music blares and the two of them go crazy Charley is
quite a sexy dancer as is George He twists lower and lower
as the two of them have a Watusi competition all the time
laughing

As Charley shakes her head and goes wild she loses her
balance in her mules and falls back onto George The two of
them fall to the floor laughing

They are both flat on their backs as Charley slides into a
comfortable spot under George’s arm with her head on his
shoulder

They slowly calm down and their laughter turns to sweet
smiles of exhausted drunken contentment as the record dies
down and turns itself off

They look blissful lying on the white shag carpet as they
regain their breath

GEORGE
Don’t move

George jumps up slips off his jacket and tosses a few
pillows to the floor He grabs their drinks Charley’s pink
cigarettes and an ashtray and heads back to her

He slides back down next to her lights two cigarettes at
the same time gives one to her and takes the other one for
himself

CHARLEY
Very smooth cigarette move
GEORGE
I’ve always wanted to do that

CHARLEY
You don’t even smoke

GEORGE

Well not for the last 16 years
Jim hated What’s to stop me now
It’s not as if it’s going to kill
me is it

They both laugh and blow smoke into the air

CHARLEY
This is so nice lying here with
you Don’t you ever miss this What
we could have been to each other
Having a real relationship and

kids
GEORGE
(stunned)
I had Jim
CHARLEY

I know but I mean a real
relationship Geo let’s be honest
what you and Jim had was great but
wasnt it really just a substitute
for something else

George sits up and looks directly at Charley

GEORGE
Is that really what you think after
all of these years That Jim was
just a substitute for real love

George really loses his temper

GEORGE (CONTD)
Jim wasn’t a substitute for
anything and there is no
substitute for Jim anywhere And
(MORE )

GEORGE (CONTD)
by the way what was so REAL about
your relationship with Richard He
left you after 9 years Jim and
I were together for 16 years and
if he hadn’t died we would still
be together What the hell is
not REAL about that

George disgusted gets up and stands in front of the fire
He stands dead still for a moment trying to compose himself
Charley is stunned and doesn’t move

Charley has been stung by George’s comments about her
marriage

CHARLEY
I didn’t mean it the way it
sounded I know how much the two
of you loved each other

CHARLEY (CONTD)
I just suppose that I was always a
bit jealous that you and I never
had that kind of love Actually
I’ve never had that kind of love
with anyone I don’t think Richard
ever loved me except for the way I
looked And Clay I don’t know You
raise a child and love it and then
when they get old enough they just
leave

GEORGE
Charlotte there is nothing wrong
with your life You like feeling
sorry for yourself It’s one of
your great pleasures

CHARLEY
And it’s not one of yours You’re
as pathetic as I am

GEORGE
Feeling sorry for myself is definitely
not one of my great pleasures
Charley struggles to stand up

CHARLEY
Well its not one of mine either I
don’t like feeling sorry for myself
one bit I tried to hold onto
Richard for so long even when it
was obvious to everyone but me that
it was over Now Clay is grown up
I mean what am I doing here Geo
Tell me that

GEORGE
You have lots of friends Youll be
fine
Charley sighs
CHARLEY

Yes I have friends But none of
them need me And yes I have you
and if you weren’t such a goddamn
poof we could have all been happy

George begins to smile

Charley crosses to the coffee table lights another

cigarette takes a long drag and exhales slowly She sits
down on the sofa and George joins her He slips his arm

around her as she attempts to wriggle away

CHARLEY (CONTD)
I only have you now because you
lost Jim but I’1l lose you again
soon to someone else It’s not as
easy for a woman I did everything
the way that I was supposed to and
all I have to keep me company is a
bottle of gin

GEORGE
Maybe you should try donuts with
your gin

CHARLEY
Screw you

GEORGE
Charlotte you are dramatic You
really almost had me A tiny tear
was beginning to form in the corner
of my eye Now stop it you know
that you are still breathtakingly
beautiful when you bother to get
yourself up and out of bed and you
stop whimpering about everything
for five minutes Move back to
London Change your life If you’re
not happy being a woman then stop
acting like one

CHARLEY
You have all the goddamn answers
don’t you If you’re so smart why
aren’t YOU making something new
happen in your life (beat) I’m
serious Why don’t you take that
position at Stanford Why do you
keep teaching at that little school
when you could have any position
you want

GEORGE
I think what I’ve done has been
worthwhile

George is stung

CHARLEY
I’m sorry I shouldn’t have said
that (beat) As much as I dread it
I think I might move back to
London

GEORGE
Why do you dread it

CHARLEY
When I lived in London last I was
YOUNG I was fresh I was
everything Coming to America was
(MORE )

They both s

George chec

such a dream it was the icing on
the cake Going home is defeat
None of it really worked out the
way I‘d planned

GEORGE
Most things don’t work out the way
people plan You’re living in the
past You need to start thinking
about the future

CHARLEY
Living in the past IS my future
You’re a man It doesn’t have to be
yours

it silently for a moment

CHARLEY (CONTD)
And you’re a bore tonight Can’t we
just feel sorry for ourselves a
little bit longer Mix me up
another drink Please

ks his watch 1045
GEORGE

I don’t think so I have to go
Come on Walk me out

He gets up and takes his jacket from the back of the sofa

Charley gets up and follows him as they walk toward the

entry hall

CHARLEY
But this was such fun

GEORGE
I have to

CHARLEY
When will I see you again

GEORGE
Arent you moving to London

CHARLEY
I’1l never do that It’s far too
much effort Besides I don’t think
Jim would want me to leave you here
in LA all alone

GEORGE
Don’t worry about me Charley I’m
OK I’ve got all the answers
Remember

CHARLEY
What are you doing this weekend

GEORGE
I think I might just be very quiet

CHARLEY
You never really did take me
seriously did you George

George opens the door turns and faces her

GEORGE
I tried to Charley Remember A
long time ago It didn’t quite
work did it Good night Charley

As they embrace she kisses him hard For a moment he kisses
her back until her kiss turns serious and desperate

George calmly backs up and looks into her eyes With both
hands he firmly grips her arms and kisses her again on the

mouth but this time it is a chaste good-bye kiss

Charley behaves She is defeated and we feel that this scene
has been played out before in their relationship

GEORGE (CONTD)
Sleep tight I love you

She resigns herself to him leaving and stares at the back
of the door as he closes it behind him

EXT GEORGE’S HOUSE SANTA MONICA NIGHT -- LATER An exterior shot of the full moon through the trees
George’s house is illuminated in the background

INT GEORGE’S HOUSE - STUDY NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS
George is sitting at his desk writing a note

George seals the note and then picks up the gun and holds it
for a moment as he places the gun gently to his head

FLASHBACK - EXT STARBOARD SIDE BAR -- NIGHT George walks up the sidewalk towards the bar It is a lively
scene outside with the bar crowd spilling out onto the
sidewalk George approaches the door and pushes himself
inside

FLASHBACK - INT STARBOARD SIDE BAR NIGHT CONTINUOUS

The bar is packed and filled with many men in their Naval
uniforms It is also filled with girls who have clearly
dolled themselves up for the evening

All are laughing and talking loudly It is a wild and
raucous atmosphere and filled with so much smoke that it is
hard to see

George walks in and not being able to find a spot to stand
orders a beer and a pack of cigarettes at the bar and goes
outside to smoke and enjoy the cool breeze

FLASHBACK - EXT STARBOARD SIDE BAR NIGHT --
CONTINUOUS

George is standing outside enjoying his cigarette as a young
Naval officer walks into the bar

George briefly locks eyes with the young man After a few
moments the young officer returns with a beer - it’s Jim

JIM
It’s too hot in there

GEORGE
Yes it is Would you like a
cigarette
JIM
No thanks I don’t smoke Is this
place always this crowded

GEORGE
Well it is Saturday night but no
it’s usually not quite this bad
Most people just stop in here to
pick someone up and then head on
down the beach for the rest of the
evening

JIM
Yeah It’s pretty wild out there
I’m surprised the cops don’t break
it up Is it always like that

GEORGE
Since the war ended I think it’s
pretty great actually Kind of
pagan

Jim puts his hand out

JIM
Jim

The two men shake hands

GEORGE
George Pleased to meet you Jim

JIM
I’m supposed to meet some friends
here but they’re nowhere to be
found

GEORGE
I just needed to get out of the
house I was just going to take a
walk but the lure of a cold beer
got to me

George puts out his cigarette

JIM
Do you live close by

GEORGE
Yes In the canyon

JIM
How long have you lived here

GEORGE
Since 38 Where are you from

JIM
Colorado But I really like it
here I think I might stay after
I’m discharged It’s great I love
being so close to the ocean I
don’t know perhaps I’m just a bit
of a pagan

Just then it begins to rain lightly The two men look at
each other and then scramble for the door to the bar as the
rain starts coming down hard and fast

FLASHBACK - INT STARBOARD SIDE BAR NIGHT --
CONTINUOUS

It is packed inside and George and Jim are literally pressed
up against each other There is an electricity between the
two of them It is so loud inside the bar that they have to
shout

JIM
Another beer

GEORGE
That would be great

Just then a beautiful BLONDE GIRL with Veronica Lake hair
and a cherry red mouth pushes between the two of them As
she does she looks up at Jim

BLONDE GIRL
Well hello

JIM
Hello

BLONDE GIRL
Want to buy me a drink

Jim looks past the girl directly into George’s eyes

JIM
I’m afraid I’m taken

BLONDE GIRL
Too bad Too bad

She pushes away from them back into the crowd as the two men
smile at each other

END FLASHBACK
INT GEORGE’S HOUSE - STUDY NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

George sits still for a moment puts the gun down jumps up
and runs down the hall to the kitchen

INT GEORGE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS
OUR VIEW IS FROM OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE

George crosses to the liquor cabinet and grabs the bottle of
scotch There is only a drop left

George puts down the bottle takes off his glasses and goes
out the front door

EXT CAMPHOR TREE LANE NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS
As George leaves his driveway he hears someone behind him

We see clearly the outline of Kenny’s bike in the foreground
but George doesn’t see this

He stops and looks around Nothing George continues his jog
down the hill

EXT STARBOARD SIDE BAR NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER

George approaches the bar He opens the door and goes in
The place is a faded version of its 1946 incarnation

INT STARBOARD SIDE BAR NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

The bar now sports a jukebox in the corner and a television
above it A neon Budweiser signclock tells us it is 1103

Most of the patrons sit at the long bar staring lazily at
the television in a cow daze

George heads to the bar and calls out to PATRICK the
bartender

GEORGE
Patrick could I have a bottle of
scotch and a pack of Lucky Strikes

to go please

As he says this he notices a young man who walks into the
bar

A slow steady smile crosses George’s face - it’s Kenny
George looks to the bartender

GEORGE (CONTD)
Patrick Cancel that

He holds up two fingers and points to his regular booth
Patrick nods

George walks over to the booth

Kenny slips onto the bench across from George Kenny is
slightly out of breath

GEORGE (CONTD)
Well hello Mr Potter

KENNY
Hello sir

The bartender places their drinks in front of them

KENNY (CONTD)
What are we drinking
GEORGE
Scotch
KENNY
OK
They each take a sip
GEORGE

I come here all the time I live
around the corner but then you
know that

KENNY
On Camphor Tree Lane

They smile at each other

George reaches into his pants pocket pulls out his pencil

sharpener and places it on the table with a smile

KENNY (CONTD)
You’re still carrying that around

GEORGE
One must always appreciate life’s
little gifts

Kenny and George smile at each other

GEORGE (CONTD)
So what are you doing here

KENNY
Just out for a ride on my bike

GEORGE
Is that all

KENNY
I don’t know

GEORGE
Were you looking for me
KENNY
Maybe I don’t know I feel like my
head’s stopped up with stuff with
crap

GEORGE
Stuff like what

KENNY
Like the stuff you were talking
about today in class

GEORGE
That is definitely not important

KENNY
No it is important Your class is
great But somehow we always seem
to get stuck talking about the
past The past just doesn’t matter
to me

GEORGE
And the present

KENNY
I can’t wait for the present to be
over It’s a total drag Well
tonight’s the exception

George bursts into laughter

KENNY (CONTD)
What

GEORGE
Tonight - yes The present - no
Let’s drink to tonight
They clink glasses

KENNY
Tonight

They both take a sip
GEORGE
So if the past doesn’t matter and
the present is a “total drag” What
about the future

KENNY
What future I mean Cuba might just
blow us up

GEORGE
Death is the future

KENNY
I’m sorry I don’t mean to be
depressing

GEORGE
It’s not depressing it’s true I
mean it’s not necessarily your
immediate future but it’s what we
all share Death is the future

KENNY
You’re right I guess

GEORGE
If one is not enjoying one’s
present there isn’t a great deal to
suggest that the future should be
any better

KENNY
Yeah I’ve thought that before But
the thing is you just never know
Look at tonight

George looks intently at Kenny

KENNY (CONTD)
Actually I feel really alone most
of the time

GEORGE
You do

KENNY
Yeah I’ve always felt this way I
mean we’re born alone we die
alone And while we’re here we are
absolutely completely sealed in
our own bodies Really weird Kinda
freaks me out to think about it We
can only experience the outside
world through our own slanted
perception of it Who knows what
you’re really like I just see what
I think you’re like

GEORGE
I’m exactly what I seem to be if
you look closely You know the only
thing that has made the whole thing
worthwhile has been those few times
that I was able to truly connect
with another person

KENNY
I had a hunch about you sir

GEORGE
You did

KENNY
Yes sir I had a hunch you might
be a real romantic

George smiles

KENNY (CONTD)
You know everyone keeps telling
you that when you’re older that
you’1l have all this experience -
like it’s some great thing

GEORGE
That’s a load of shit I think I’ve
actually just gotten sillier and
sillier

KENNY
Really

GEORGE
Absolutely

KENNY
So all your experience is useless

GEORGE
No I wouldn’t say that As our
friend Mr Huxley says “Experience
is not what happens to a man it is
what a man does with what happens
to him”

Kenny looks at George and then blurts out

KENNY
Let’s go swimming

GEORGE
OK

Kenny bursts into laughter George is confused but grins
anyway

GEORGE (CONTD)
What

KENNY
It was a test I thought you were
bluffing about being silly so I
said to myself Ill suggest doing
something completely outrageous and
if he resists if he even hesitates
- then I know he’s full of shit

GEORGE
Well I wasn’t Were you

KENNY
Hell no

They both jump up George throws a few bills on the table
and follows Kenny out of the bar

KENNY
Come on sir I’1l help you down

KENNY (CONTD)
Let’s go

Kenny turns and runs whooping and pulling off his clothes

George follows As he watches Kenny undress he hesitates
momentarily and then begins to unbutton his shirt

EXT SURF LINE NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

A naked Kenny runs toward the surf and fearlessly dives into
the waves

Seeing Kenny George toughens up He slips off his pants
runs after Kenny and dives in

A wave splashes over George and he stumbles He finds his
balance and continues out

George makes his way out further still laughing as Kenny
continues to plunge in and out of the waves

Emboldened by Kenny’s enthusiasm George wades out
further his arms outstretched

EXT SANTA MONICA STATE BEACH NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS
A naked George is way out and almost out of his depth as a

towering wave pulls the surf away from him George tries to
brace himself against the giant wave but instead he is

knocked flat and suddenly pulled underwater He does not
resurface Kenny dives under water to look for George

EXT OCEAN - NIGHT --CONTINUOUS

George gasps for air as Kenny pulls him to the surface and

EXT SANTA MONICA STATE BEACH - NIGHT --CONTINUOUS

Kenny gets George to their clothes and starts toweling
himself off

KENNY
Can we go back to your place sir

GEORGE
Of course Where else

George begins dressing

KENNY
Where else

Kenny smiles and grabs the rest of his clothes heading back
toward the highway still naked

GEORGE
Are you out of your mind

KENNY
What’s the matter

GEORGE
You can’t walk home like that

George catches up with Kenny

KENNY
Were invisible don’t you know
that

George stops dead in his tracks with this line from Kenny

George is very cold but Kenny seems in his element He puts
his arm around George’s shoulders

KENNY (CONTD)
You know sir they ought not to let
you out on your own You’re liable
to get into real trouble

GEORGE
Oh I excel at it

Kenny looks at George who has a small cut over his left eye

KENNY
Your forehead is bleeding

George reaches up and touches his brow He looks at his hand
and sees the blood on his fingers

INT GEORGE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM NIGHT -- LATER

They enter the house Kenny is full of energy and George has
sobered up a little from the walk back

GEORGE
The bathroom is down the hall if
you would like to take a shower

KENNY
Arent you taking a shower too

GEORGE

Im fine I’m English We like to
be cold and wet

KENNY

Kenny looks at the sleeping bag

KENNY
Going camping sir

GEORGE
Really I’m fine

KENNY
Stay there Ill be right back

George sits down on the sleeping bag
INT GEORGE’S HOUSE - BATHROOM NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

Kenny walks into the bathroom He opens the drawer next
to the sink and pulls out a cotton ball and a bottle of
alcohol He finds a tin of band-aids As he lifts it up
something catches his eye It is the nude photograph of
Jim taken in the desert

Kenny stares at the picture a moment looks towards the
bedroom and then quickly puts it back in the drawer

INT GEORGE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

Kenny returns to the bedroom where George is lying flat on
the bed with his feet on the ground

KENNY
Sit up

George obeys much to his surprise as Kenny seems suddenly
in control

KENNY (CONTD)
Tilt your head back

Kenny gently cleans George’s forehead with a cotton ball
soaked in alcohol George winces slightly but his eyes are
locked on his new friend Kenny puts a band-aid across the

cut over George’s brow and gently brushes his wet hair back
with his fingers

KENNY (CONTD)
Well sir I’m afraid this time you
don’t have the excuse of mescaline
to explain your bandage

GEORGE
I think that we need to get you out
of those wet clothes

KENNY
Yes sir

Kenny stands up and moves to the corner next to a chair He
kicks off his shoes and undresses very slowly He carefully
lays his clothes on the chair Standing nude Kenny turns
towards George He looks shy and nervous George who still
sits on the edge of the bed does not take his eyes off of
Kenny

Kenny smiles sweetly at George but George does not react

Suddenly embarrassed Kenny turns and walks into the
bathroom He doesn’t close the door after him but is out
of George’s sight The shower is turned on

George is not sure what to do Looking towards the bathroom
he contemplates going in but instead rushes to his closet
and grabs his robe

INT GEORGE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER
George lights a fire He turns on the Hi-Fi and adjusts
the lights Kenny comes into the room wrapped in a grey

blanket

GEORGE
You’re not too cold

KENNY
I’m great

GEORGE
Would you like a drink
KENNY
Id love a beer sir if you have
one

GEORGE
I’m afraid that’s all we have Two
beers coming up

Kenny is examining an architectural model next to the
drafting table as George arrives and hands him his beer

KENNY
You live here all by yourself sir

GEORGE
I do now I used to share this
place with a friend He was an
architect

KENNY
Man guys my age dream about the
kind of setup you’ve got here I
mean what more can you want You
get to be left alone and come and
go as you please

GEORGE
And that’s your idea of the perfect
life

KENNY

What’s the matter sir You don’t
believe me

GEORGE
If you’re so keen on living by
yourself where does Lois fit into
this plan

KENNY
Lois What’s she got to do with
anything

GEORGE

I had the impression that you and
she were together

KENNY
Not really I mean she’s kind of
cool and were good friends but I
think what you really want to ask
me is if we sleep together

GEORGE
And do you

KENNY
We did Once

GEORGE
Why only once

KENNY
I didn’t say only once I said
once Come on the last thing I
want to talk about right now is
Lois

KENNY (CONTD)
What time is it

George looks at his watch The second hand is not moving and
the case is clouded over

GEORGE
I don’t know My watch seems to
have stopped

George bangs his watch on the table

GEORGE (CONTD)
What does it matter anyway

KENNY
Would you like me to go

GEORGE
No are you kidding Get us both

another beer

Kenny jumps up and heads to the kitchen then looks back

KENNY
Is that an order sir

GEORGE
You’re damn right it is

George tries to get up but he struggles quite drunk now
and falls back into his chair

GEORGE (CONTD)
(to himself)
Pathetic

Kenny arrives with two bottles of beer

KENNY
Were you saying something sir

George gives Kenny a concentrated stare

GEORGE
Why are you here Why did you ask
the secretary in the office for my
address

KENNY
I just wanted to see you someplace
other than school

GEORGE
Why

KENNY
Sometimes I think I’m crazy because
I see things so differently than
everyone else does I feel like I
can talk to you To be honest sir I
was also worried about you today

GEORGE
Me What’s to be worried about I’m
fine

George’s vision begins to blur as Kenny moves toward us Our
image fades to a dusky brown

GEORGE (CONTD)
Im fine

CUT TO
EXT UNDERWATER

We are underwater in George’s recurring dream From the top
of our screen drifts the nude body of George arms
outstretched sinking slowly He moves his legs in a slight
struggle as he drops further and further underwater George
begins to toss and turn violently in the water searching for
air This time he suddenly rights himself and begins pushing
toward the surface of the water He climbs higher and higher
and hits the surface with a loud gasp for air

CUT TO
INT GEORGE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM NIGHT -- LATER
George wakes up in bed with a deep gasp for air
He looks around the room for a moment He is still dressed
in his robe The light is on
He looks to the chair- Kenny’s clothes are still there

INT GEORGE’S HOUSE - STUDY NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

George walks into the study In the faint light we see Kenny
asleep on the sofa underneath the blanket

George stands over Kenny a minute looking at him The light
is catching on Kenny’s thick lashes Kenny is breathing
gently He looks angelic and very very young

Kenny’s hands are holding onto something under the blanket
George carefully pulls the blanket back to reveal Kenny
loosely gripping George’s gun

George reaches down and gently lifts the gun out of Kenny’s
hand and pulls the blanket up over Kenny’s chest

As George stares down at Kenny asleep a warm smile creeps
across his face

George crosses the room and stares at the desk top It has
been disturbed His perfect grid of papers is out of order
He opens the desk drawer and puts the gun carefully inside

He lifts the key out of the drawer locks the desk and slips
the key into the pocket of his robe

INT GEORGE’S BEDROOM NIGHT 1962--CONTINUOUS

George walks towards the glass door that opens to his back
yard It is a beautiful night We can hear the sound of the
surf in the distance and the sounds of the crickets and
frogs

An enormous owl almost 2 feet tall is sitting perfectly
still in a branch of the large pine tree directly outside of
the glass door at eye level with George but George does not
see this As he opens the door the owl suddenly spreads it’s
wings and takes flight

As this happens our sound stops abruptly and we are left in
total silence

George freezes gazing at the full amber colored moon and
drinking in the feeling of the fresh air

It is clear from his face that he is a different man He is
free The cloud has lifted

George bats his eyes and as he does our sound snaps back

GEORGE VO
A few times in my life I’ve had
moments of absolute clarity

George walks back into the study and stands over Kenny and
smiles

GEORGE VO (CONTD)
When for a few brief seconds the
silence drowns out the noise and I
can feel rather than think

George goes to the desk gathers the note to Charley and one
of the other letters

GEORGE VO (CONTD)
And things seem so sharp and the
world seems so fresh

He turns out the lamp and quietly closes the double doors to
the study leaving Kenny asleep on the sofa

INT GEORGE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS
George slips down the hall to the living room which is still
illuminated by the embers of the dying fire He throws the

letters into the fireplace and watches them flare up

He puts his hands in the pockets of his robe and lets out a
deep sigh

GEORGE VO
I can never make these moments
last I cling to them but like
everything they fade

The golden light from the fire rakes across George’s face as
he beams

INT GEORGE’S BEDROOM NIGHT 1962 -- MOMENTS LATER
George sits on the edge of his bed He is ecstatic
GEORGE VO
I have lived my live on these
moments

CUT TO

FLASHBACK OF GEORGE AND CHARLEY DOING THE TWIST EARLIER IN
THE EVENING

CUT BACK TO
INT GEORGE’S BEDROOM NIGHT 1962--CONTINUOUS

GEORGE VO
They pull me back to the present

George is sitting on his bed reveling in his new found
peace

GEORGE VO (CONTD)
and I realize that everything is
exactly the way it was meant to be

George still smiling reaches towards his bedside table to
pour himself a glass of water from the carafe As he does
this his arm goes numb - he can’t use his hand He tries
again and then grabs onto his wrist with his other hand

We see a look of disbelief in George’s face as there is
suddenly a sharp pain in his chest

His face is contorted with panic He tries to cry out but
can only muster a slight moan

George attempts to stand but falls to the floor As he does
he hits the night stand violently with his body

The clock hits the floor breaking its face

George lies silently on the floor He begins to lose
consciousness

There is no sound except for the sound of the clock which
ticks loudly for a few beats and then abruptly stops

QUICK CUTS OF A COMPLETELY STILL GEORGE FROM ALL SIDES AND
ANGLES

FROM THE CEILING WE PUSH IN SLOWLY UNTIL WE ARE JUST OVER
GEORGE’S BODY WE ARE INTIMATE WITH HIM AND HEAR HIM
BREATHING

Into our warm brown screen moves slowly an EVER CLOSER SOFT
FOCUS SHOT OF JIM Jim moves toward us as FOCUS SHARPENS and
he comes in for a very gentle kiss Jim’s face fills our
screen and then he pulls away slowly and recedes into the
darkness

We settle in an intimate way close to Georges face We
quite literally feel him slip away from us

The sounds of life grow increasingly faint George lets out
a deep but relaxed sigh as his jaw slackens and his eyes
begin to glaze and lose focus George is completely
motionless but he now has the faintest smile on his face

The room is warm and dark and pleasant

Shot from above Georges face fills our screen as we slowly
pull back

GEORGE VO (CONTD)
And just like that it came

We are now high above George and his outstretched body fills
our screen as our image gradually begins to desaturate and

then bleaches to white as we -

CUT TO BLACK
