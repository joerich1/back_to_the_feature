it at a SOLDIER running away in the distance He lets off a

smoke GRENADE LAUNCHER loading a cartridge and shoving the
barrel into the hole

Zeke pulls the trigger

Moments later the SUVs arrive Several large men emerge
with semi-automatic weapons

We track one of these men as he steps from the lead car and
approaches the truck The men circle around him This is
their leader -- DIETER VON CUNTH 60 handsome charming
Cunth is closely followed by CONSTANTINE BACH -- bald no
eyebrows terrifying Close behind them are HECTOR AND EDWIN

Open it

CLOSE ON the back doors of the truck are opened to reveal
another set of doors with an elaborate alarm mechanism

ZEKE
I got it

Zeke takes a descrambling device from his duffel bag and
hooks it up to the alarm The code is immediately broken
Airlocks hiss as the doors swing open

Through the smoke we reveal sleek metal walls -- this is no
ordinary truck Men in military uniforms are strewn
unconscious on the floor In the middle of the truck is a
NUCLEAR MISSILE with the letters “X5T-337TVS” written on the
side
Zeke whistles reverently

scope out a warehouse Two guards are on either side of the

here and two at the south entrance

out of the equation

Then it’s three on two we’ll have
the advantage

MACGRUBER
Well keep in mind one of our
three is a woman

VICKI
(sarcastic)
Thanks MacGruber

MACGRUBER
No I meant that in a good way
You count as like one and a half
people

truly mean it

in time

However the minister is blown to smithereens

Cunth drops the rocket launcher and charges at MacGruber
MacGruber quickly overpowers him and punches and kicks him
until he’s right at the edge of the cliff
