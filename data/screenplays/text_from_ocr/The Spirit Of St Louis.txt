FADE IN
PLANE IN THE SKY DAY

Fleecy clouds in the bg The credit titles appear over

this while the tiny plane flies steadily in the distant sky
At the end of the main title credits a DISSOLVE brings in a
LEGEND against the same bg i

In 1927 i
a young man alone in a single engine
airplane flew non-stop from Roosevelt

Field in New York across the entire
North Atlantic Ocean to Le Bourget Field
in Paris a distance of three thousand i
six hundred and ten miles i

In this triumph of mind body and 7
spirit Charles A Lindbergh influenced
the lives of everyone on earth -- for in the
33 hours and 30 minutes of his flight the
air age became a reality

This is the story of that flight i

The sound of the typewriters filters up into the dim corridor

At one end a red fire exit globe shines A shaft of yellow
comes from an open transom Mahoney sits on a chair in front
of the door to Room 106

Suddenly from a tinny phonograph the chorus of RIO RITA blares

into the corridor Mahoney jumps up goes quickly to the
door with the lighted transom - this is the room the music is
coming from He raps on the door opens it sticks his head

in The phonograph stops He closes the door returns to his

chair in front of Room 106 -Then on second thought he
gently turns the doorknob and looks into 106

wavers on Empty He slips the flashlight in his pocket holds
the stick between his knees and unbuckles the safety belt

The engine coughs again then spits a couple of timee and dies
Now there is only the sound of the wind whining through the

Lindbergh sits up on the side of the cockpit and rolis oft
into space The ship glides on for a moment then noses
down the whine rising to a scream —
Lindbergh is swinging under his parachute his flashlight
earthward hoping to get a glimpse of what might be in store
for him below There is the faint sound of the wind screaming
through the struts of the falling plane coming nearer and -
nearer

Lindbergh looks up He sweeps his flashlight around the snowy
sky The scream of the plane is louder Suddenly the wing
lights appear The plane comes banking out of the snowcircles
past him with inches to sparse The sound recedes then grows
louder again - again it comes careening toward the parachute
Lindbergh seizes the shroud lines and pulls The chute alips
down and away just as the wild plane is about to stick its
nose in the silk The plane spirals away again - then close
again - makes another pass - then crashes somewhere below

the attention hes getting removes the helmet and fumbles
it into his pocket

It is bustling with activity The marble pillars marble
floor the Victorian grills in the tellers windows breathe
of conservatism

Lindbergh enters the bank He is wearing shiny blue serge
pants leather jacket sweater khaki shirt and dark tie He
checks his wrist watch against the big clock It is 1100
AM He sits on a bench towait Knight comes out of a
nearby room greets him

KNIGHT
Slim

Lindbergh looks around In the open door leading to the ex-
ecutive office stands Harry Knight beckoning Lindbergh in
Knight is a stocky energetic young man - not much older than
Lindbergh Lindbergh gets up apprehensively crosses toward
Knight Knight ushers him into the executive office

INT EXECUTIVE OFFICE DAY

If the business floor of the bank impressed you with its
sober solidity this office has got it in spades Dark
mahogany paneling dignified carpeting deep leather chairs

Behind the broad desk sits Harold Bixby - an authoritative
man in his forties with a black moustache penetrating
brown eyes and a carnation in the lapel of his well-cut
suit

In the chairs around the desk are Major Lambert - a distin-
guished elderly man in a high stiff collar with an erect
military bearing Bill Robertson - a handsome open-faced

man in his thirties with dark wavy hair E Lansing Ray -

in his late forties - a round-faced balding sober-minded
man wearing rimless pince-nez glasses Earl Thompson - 4

dapper blond man in his early forties wearing a pearl in
his necktie They all smoke cigars with the exception of

Thompson who chews on a pipe

Knight ushers Lindbergh in The padded door closes behind
them All eyes are on Lindbergh He feels acutely uncom-
fortable in his leather jacket This is so unlike the
cockpits and hangars in which he feels at home

KNIGHT

also the president of the Chamber of Commerce

BIXBIE
Mr Lindbergh weve been going over your
outline of the project Now you say here
on page one in order to show the potent-
falities of flight in order to dramatic
ally demonstrate to the public the possibilities
of comnercial aviation

Lindbergh is desperately trying to light the cigar
BIXBY

You say aviation is no longer a new-born
baby but it is in danger of becoming a dwarfed

stepchild unless capital has enough foresight to

‘Lindbergh is still struggling with the cigar Knight leans
down and whispers into his ear

KNIGHT
You better bite the end off Slim

LINDBERGH
Oh

He bites off the end doesnt quite know what to do with it
finally puts it in his pocket He lights the cigar fighting
a cough

BIXBY s
Then you say if men of means and vision
in St Louis financed this flight it would help
to establish our city as a hub of the nations
airways of the future This all makes good
sense Mr Lindbergh and we certainly admire
your spirit but is such a flight feasible ----
ean it be done

LINDBERGH
Well --

Another puff on the cigar another cough

RAY
You understand of course Mr Lindbergh that
before we at the Globe-Democrat can lend our
support we must make absolutely sure that we
are not financinga suicide

THOMPSON
Mr Lindbergh when you talk about this flight
stimulating aviation - in about 1921 a man went

over Nisgara Falls in a barrel I dont remember

that this particularly stimulated barrel traffic
anywhere

LINDBERGH
That was a stunt Mr Thompson Now - I dont
propose to sit on a flagpole or swallow goldfish
Itm not a stunt man Im a flyer

BIXBY
You suggest here flying over the ocean in a land
plane - wouldnt a seaplane be a surer bet If
anything happened you could set it down in the
water

LINDBERGH
Yes but the idaa is not to set it down on the
water - the idea is to set it down on Le Bourget
Field in Paris -

THOMPSON
We understand you correctly - the Bellanca you
want us to buy is a single wing

LINDBERGH

Yes sir Less drag - more lift
RAY

And a single engine
LINDBERGE

Thats right sir And it can be purchased for
fifteen thousand dollars Now I have two
thousand of my own Id like to put in

“ BIXBY
Youve got two thousand and seventy to be
exact I know your account

LINDBERGH
Well I figure Id better keep the seventy for
that rainy day -

BIXBY
Good idea

your venture it wouldnt be to make any money --
it would be done in the same kind of - uh

LAMBERT
The same kind of spirit that you yourself have --
Well you know what I mean

Thank you Major Lambert

Bixby has been doodling on a blank sheet of bank stationery
Over the letterhead STATE NATIONAL BANK OF ST LOUIS he is
now beginning to doodle the word SPIRIT

THOMPSON
Mr Lindbergh Im in the insurance business
Im interested in percentages Is a single-
engine plane a good idea Wouldnt a three-
engine plane be safer I mean in case one of
the engines conked out

LINDBERGH
Well of course there is always the danger of
an engine quitting - but if you have three en-

the craft of the dauntless Frenchmen or some other
unlooked-for mishap Aviation experts believe
that ice forming on the wings in the cold rainy
region east of Newfoundland may have plunged Nun-

which has overtaken the French aces are going
ahead with their own preparations As soon as
theyre ready they will launch their planes on the
long mysterious air road to Paris which by now has
claimed the lives of so many flyers There is also
a bulletin from San Diego California that an

in keeping with the serenity of the black dickey and
priests collar Nor is his juvenile delight with being
up there at the controls of the ship

Lindbergh shouts instructions over his shoulder to

DISSOLVE TO

BROOKS FIELD DAY

Four shining army planes and twenty shining cadets are lined
up smartly for inspection Captain Coleman - the antiseptic
disciplinarian - is giving the outfit a thorough going over
He walks down the line followed by an adjutant First he
runs his white-gloved hand over the top of a wing checking
for dust Its spotiess Next he disapproves of the angle
of the propeller All the other planes have their propellers
straight up and down This one is slightly cocked to one
side He shoots a dirty look at the Cadet in charge of the
plane The Cadet nudges the prop into line

Thats good enough for Captain Coleman He moves on to the
next plane ducks under it inspects the under-belly of the
engine A drop of black oil falls on his nose He freezes -
straightens up slowly - then confronts the Cadet Leader of
the leaky plane - no shouting mind you - more cat and mouse

graduating from this here field

During this harangue the SOUND of an approaching plane hes
become increasingly louder The Captain does not like to be
Growned out He looks up angrily

Cireling over the field is Lindberghs Jenny Its in pitiful
shape The engine knocks and spits The fuselage cloth is
patched all over - the struts held together with baling wire
and splints The lettering (SLIMS SPECTACULAR SKY-RIDES -
15 MINUTES - 3 DOLLARS) is worn and peeling

Lindbergh gets ready for a landing He doesnt look much
better than his plane - his greasy helmet coming apart at
the seams his goggles awry on the top of his head

The Captain and the cadets watch the horrible crate set
elegantly down on the field and taxi toward them The Jenny
coms to a stop radiator steaming Lindbergh climbs out The

He banks the plane around For the first time since he left
Long Isiand the Spirit now flies west - from right to left--
and losing altitude all the time
The altimeter shows five hundred feet

Lindbergh works hard to maintain altitude

‘Below he sees the raging sea whipped up by the wind -- and

ahead an opening ‘in the icy clouds

He swings the plane tries to get through - before its too
late - - or is it too late already - -

The Spirit bursts out of the ice storm into the moonlight

It looks beautitul - like a strange sleigh - all sugar-
frosted - - yet its sinking -- dropping helplessly from the
weight of its beauty

The motor begins to die

There it is ice smothering the carburetor Burn

Working furiously at the controls Lindbergh guns the motor
into a series of shattering backfires and it picks up again
But the Spirit is still dropping under its heavy load of ice
We see the altimeter needle moving inexorably down toward
zero Lindbergh rocks the plane desperately oryine to shake
off the ice but it holds

He does not cut it

On top of the wing the ice splits a big slab peels off
hurtles back against the fuselage and into the sea

Lindbergh hand on the throttle eyes on the water ready to

knows the sound He kicks the rudder hard

The plane rocks violently - the wings perilously close to the

Lindbergh pulls back the stick

the control stick falls off to dangle between his legs
Under his feet the pedals move without aid

The Spirit flies steadily on for awhile the control stick

below the horizon the wings tilt

Lindbergh rolls slightly does not awaken

The drone of the engine takes on a faster tempo wind through
the struts rises to a whistle - the Spirit glides down in an
