INT DON CORLEONES OLD OFFICE -— CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL
CORLEONE — DAY

standing impassively like a young Prince recently crowned
King

CLOSE VIEW ON Michaels hand ROCCO LAMPONE kisses his hand
Then it is taken away We can SEE only the empty desk and
chair of Michaels father Vito Corleone We HEAR over
this very faintly a funeral dirge played in the distance

as THE VIEW MOVES SLOWLY CLOSER to the empty desk and chair

DISSOLVE TO
EXT A SICILIAN LANDSCAPE - FULL VIEW - DAY
We can barely make out the funeral procession passing over

the burnt-brown of a dry river bed The figures move
slowly seemingly from out of hundreds of years of the past

H

he MUSICIANS walking unsteadily on the rocky bed their
instruments harsh and blaring

They are followed by six young peasant men carrying the
crude wooden coffin on their shoulders Then the widow a
strong large woman dressed in black and not accepting the
arms of those walking with her

Behind her not more than twenty relatives few children and
paisani continue alone behind the coffin

Suddenly we HEAR the shots of the lupara and the musicians
stop their playing The entire procession scatters in odd
directions along the rocky river bed

The young men struggle with the burden of the heavy coffin
throwing it out of balance and nearly crashing to the ground
We hear a woman SCREAMING

EXT SICILIAN LANDSCAPE —- MED VIEW - DAY

across the slain body of a fourteen year old boy lying on
the parched ground In the distance we see four or five of
the mourning women the wind blowing their black dresses and
veils running up to the body of the boy They begin to
wail and cry out in anguished Sicilian as the widow the
mother of the murdered boy holds her child in her arms his
fresh blood wetting her strong hands

EXT BARONIAL ESTATE - TIGHT MOVING VIEW - DAY
A boy eight or nine with wide frightened eyes being
pulled quickly by the hand This is VITO ANDOLINI who is

to become The Godfather

The VIEW ALTERS revealing that he is being pulled along by
his Mother the Widow across a field leading to the

ornamental gates of a Baronial Estate of some forgotten Noble

At various positions near the gates are men with shotguns
or lupara The gates are opened and the Widow and her boy
are shown before DON FRANCESCO a man in his sixties He
wears his trousers with suspenders and an open white shirt
sloppily tucked in over his enormous belly He wears a hat
to protect him from the white-hot sun and proudly displays
a gold watch and chain over his vest

He sits in a chair near a group of his men in the garden
listening to the Widow who stands before him with her only
son

WIDOW

(Sicilian)
Don Francesco You murdered my
husband because he would not bend
And his oldest son Paolo because
he swore revenge But Vitone is
only nine and dumb-witted He
never speaks

DON FRANCESCO
(Sicilian)
Im not afraid of his words

He is weak

DON FRANCESCO
(Sicilian)
He will grow strong

WIDOW
(Sicilian)
The child cannot harm you

DON FRANCESCO

(Sicilian)
He will be a man and then he will
come for revenge

As she pleads the Widow moves closer to the Don until she
has practically thrown herself to her knees before him

WIDOW

(Sicilian)
I beg you Don Francesco spare my
only son He is all I have In

the name of the Holy Spirit I
swear he will never be a danger to
you

Suddenly she reaches under her skirt where she has hidden
a kitchen knife

WIDOW

(continuing)

But I will kill you myself
(she lunges at the

Mafia chieftain)

Vitone go

The boy runs as fast as he can out through the gates Then
there is a lupara blast He turns and sees his Mother
flung a distance of five feet from the short range of the
terrible blast of the shotgun Then he sees the men turn
their attention to him One fires at him but the boy is
quick and disappears into a grove of olive trees

contribution donation to a
charitable cause that he controls

the inkling that you think youre
buying him hell freeze up
Nevadas a funny state they like
things both ways here All right
Turnbull says the Senator will be
here at two-thirty and hes been
primed He knows youll want to
meet with him alone and he knows
its about the Tropicanas license
At any rate he expects to be
introduced around to some of the
influential people here today and
generally treated as an ordinary
guest Just go light on him
Mikey sometimes the biggest crooks
dont like to think of themselves
as crooks

Michael glances at Hagen as though that last remark was
unnecessary

SENATOR GEARY
Alright Corleone Im going to be
very frank with you Maybe more
frank than any man in my position
has ever spoken to you before

Michael nods indicating that he should do so

SENATOR GEARY
The Corleone family controls two
major hotels in Vegas one in Reno
The licenses were grandfathered in

Gaming Commission But I have the
idea from sources

(takes the water from

Neri and swallows his pills)
that youre planning to move in
on the Tropicana In another week
or so youll move Klingman out

want to stay here any longer than I
have to You can have the license
for two hundred and fifty thousand
in cash plus a monthly fee equal
to five percent of the gross

businessman who has made a large

investment in your state I have
made that state my home plan to

license fee from the Gambling
Commission costs one thousand

secret from you Its precisely
that at this moment you are the
only one that I can completely
trust In time youll understand
everything

from my father is to try to think

as the people around you thinkand
on that basis anything is possible
Fredo has a good heart but he is
weakand stupid and stupid
people are the most dangerous of
all Ive kept you out of things
Tom because Ive always known that
your instincts were legitimate and
I wanted you to know very little of
things that would make you an
accomplice for your own protection
I never blamed you for the setbacks
the family took under Sonny I know
you were in a position of limited
power and you did your best to
advise and caution him What I am
saying is that now for how long I
do not know you will be the Don

If what I think has happened is
true I will leave tonight and
absolutely no one will know how to
contact me And even you are not

to try to reach me unless it is
absolutely necessary I give you
complete power over Neri Fredo
everyone I am trusting you with
the lives of my wife and children
and the future of this family
solely resting on your judgment and
talent

Several of the men wade down into the stream Rocco helps
and even Tom steps down to get a better look at who they
were They are total strangers Rocco examines the type of
guns they used

When they climb back onto the ground Michael is gone
Everyone notices it but no one says anything

Hagen stands there holding the envelope Michael had given
him in his hand

He realizes that now he is the DON

HAGEN
Get rid of the bodies Tomorrow

looking out the window
MICHAELS POV

Crowded streets occasional roving bands playing for the
tourists there is much evidence of tourism Americans

walking through the streets with cameras Occasionally we
see a Cuban with a row of numbers attached to his hat
carrying a big sheet of the daily lottery numbers From all

of these street impressions the city is booming with
activity but there is also much evidence of whores and
pimps and little children begging in the streets

The big American car stops at an intersection Bussetta is
sitting in the forward passenger side while Michael is in
the back He hears tapping on the window he turns and sees
four Cuban boys tapping on his window and extending their
hands and rubbing their stomachs as though they were hungry
The Cuban driver rolls down his window and shouts them away
in Spanish

MICHAELS VIEW

The old building has been totally surrounded by police and
military vehicles Right at this moment they are waiting
lazily but soldiers are there with automatic weapons ready
There is a momentary commotion inside the building and the
men brace up A Captain of the Army detachment says
something in Spanish over a megaphone and his men put their
weapons at the ready as other policemen lead a group of
civilians out of the building with their hands up

They are moved over to some military truck where they are
frisked before being loaded

All of a sudden one of the civilian rebels breaks loose
and rushes toward the command vehicle He hurls himself
into the vehicle as two police try to pull him out A

on plates and carry them to the different men

ROTH
Everything weve learned in Vegas
is true here but we can go further
The bigger the swankier the
plusher the store the more a sense
of legitimacy and the bigger
business we do
(looking at the plate
brought to him)
A smaller piece What weve
proposed to the Cuban Government is
t

(accepting a smaller piece)

Thank you We can find people in
the United States who will put up
our share for a small piece of the
action yet we will retain control

ONE OF THE MEN
How much

ROTH
A hundred million dollars But
only if this Government relaxes its
restrictions on importing building
materials well need some new
laws too but that will be no
difficulty

ANOTHER MAN
What are import duties now

ROTH
As much as seventy percent Also
Im working out an arrangement with
the Minister of Labor so that all

Dealers can be considered
specialized technicians eligible

Military Police probably an urban
guerrilla Rather than be taken
alive he exploded a grenade hidden
in his jacket taking the command
vehicle with him

The various men look up as Michael eats his cake wondering
what the point of it is

MICHAEL
It occurred to me the police are
paid to fight and the Rebels are
not

SAM ROTH
So

MICHAEL
So that occurred to me

VIEW ON ROTH
He understands Michaels point if the others do not

ROTH

This country has had rebels for the
last fifty years its part of
their blood Believe me I know
Ive been coming here since the
twenties we were running molasses
out of Havana when you were a baby
To trucks owned by your father

(he chuckles warmly

over the memory)
Well talk when were alone

And he returns his attention to the men who are gathered
with him on his birthday

that way most men frighten easy

MICHAEL

Were making a big investment in
Cuba Thats my only concern

ROTH
My concern is that the three
million never arrived at Batistas
numbered account in Switzerland
He thinks its because you have
second thoughts about his ability
to stop the rebels

MICHAEL
The money was sent

ROTH
Then you have to trace it Michael
people here look at me as a reliable
man I cant afford not to be
looked on as a reliable man But
you know all that theres nothing
you can learn from me You
shouldnt have to put up with a
sick old man as a partner

MICHAEL
I wouldnt consider anyone else

ROTH
Except the President of the United
States

He laughs slyly as though this is some private joke between
them Then his laughter becomes a cough which he painfully
stifles with a handkerchief

ROTH
If only I could live to see it
kid to be there with you How
beautifully weve done it step by
step Here protected free to

reacts to this by being even more brutally forthright than
he has to be to show his contempt for what he considers a
hypocrisy

Don Francesco if you will honor
me by allowing me to introduce my

has taken the name of this town as his name

brought you an indication of how he

GODFATHER

MICHAEL
It was not an alias GODFATHER was

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
a term of affection used by his
friends one of respect

SENATOR WEEKLER
(Senator from New
York very smooth
partly liberal
Tammany Hall)

Let me agree with that Many of my
constituents are Italian and have
been honored with that certain
friendship by my close Italian
friends Up to this point before I
have to leave this hearing to join
my own committee let me say that
this hearing on the Mafia is in no
way a slur on the Italians by the
Senate nor is it meant to be nor
will I allow it to be Italian
Americans are the hardest working
most law abiding patriotic Americans
of our country It is a shame and
a pity that a few rotten apples
give them a bad name We are here
to weed those rotten apples out of
the vast healthy barrel of Italian
Americans who are one of the
backbones of our country

There is a pause for a while while the New York Senator
poses for the TV cameras and leaves the hearing so that he
will not be associated with hearing the rough stuff

SENATOR KANE
Im sure we all agree with our
esteemed colleague Now Mr
Corleone you have been advised as
to your legal rights We have had
testimony from a preceding witness
who states you are head of the most
powerful Mafia family in this
country Are you

MICHAEL
No

SENATOR KANE
This witness has testified that you
are personally responsible for the
murder of a New York Police Captain
in the year 1947 and with him a man

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
named Virgil Sollozzo Do you deny
this

MICHAEL
I deny his every charge

SENATOR KANE
Is it true that in the year 1950
you devised the murder of the heads
of the Five Families in New York
to assume and consolidate your
nefarious power

MICHAEL
That is a complete falsehood

SENATOR KANE
Is it true that you own a
controlling interest in three of
the major hotels in Las Vegas

MICHAEL
That is not true I own some stock
in some of the hotels but only
very small amounts I also own
some American Telephone and IBM
stock

Michael had checked this point with Hagen before answering
and then once again after the answer

SENATOR ROGERS
Why is it necessary for your
counsel to advise you on that
question

MICHAEL
Senator Ive observed the head of
General Motors before a Senate
Committee and his lawyer whispered
in his ear That was not commented
upon in the way you have just done

SENATOR KANE
Mr Corleone do you have any hotel
interests in the state of Arizona
Or any gambling interests in that
state

MICHAEL
I do not

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
SENATOR KANE
Do you have interests or control
over gambling and narcotics in the
state of New York

MICHAEL
I do not

A pause Silence as the Chairman whispers something to his
assistant

Tom Hagen takes a paper out of his briefcase and addresses
the Chair

HAGEN
Senator my client would like to
read a statement for the record

SENATOR KANE
I dont think thats necessary

HAGEN
Sir my client has answered every
question asked by this committee
with the utmost cooperation and
sincerity He has not taken that
Fifth Amendment as it was his right
to do and which because of the
extreme legal complexity of this
hearing counsel advised him to do
So I think in all fairness this
committee should hear his statement
and put it in the record

SENATOR KANE
Very well

At this point Senator Rogers contemptuously walks out of the
hearing room

MICHAEL

(reading)
In the hopes of clearing my family
name in the sincere desire to give
my children their fair share of the
American way of life without a
blemish on their name and background
I have appeared before this
committee and given it all the
cooperation in my power I consider

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
my being called before this
committee an act of prejudice to
all Americans of Italian extraction
I consider it a great dishonor to
me personally to have to deny that
I am a criminal I wish to have
the following noted for the record
That I served my country faithfully
and honorably in World War II and
was awarded the Distinguished
Service Cross for actions in

defense of my country That I have
never been arrested or indicted for
any crime whatsoever that no

proof linking me to any criminal
conspiracy whether it is called
Mafia or Cosa Nostra or whatever
other name you wish to give has
ever been made public Only one
man has made charges against me
and that man is known to be a
murderer arsonist and rapist And
yet this committee had used this
person to besmirch my name My
personal protest can only be made
to the people of this country I
can only thank God that in this
country we have a legal system and
courts of law to protect innocent
people from wild accusation I
thank God for our democratic due
process of Law that shields me from
the false charges made by this
committees witness I have not
taken refuge behind the Fifth
Amendment though counsel advised
me to do so I challenge this
committee to produce any witness or
evidence against me and if they do
not I hope they will have the
decency to clear my name with the
same publicity with which they have

now besmirched it I ask this
without malice in the interests of
fair play

The television cameras have documented this moment as Hagen
hands the document over to the committee lawyer

SENATOR ROGERS
We are all impressed The committee

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
will now recess over the weekend
However it will continue Monday
morning at eleven am At that
time this committee will then
produce a witness directly linking
Mr Corleone to the charges we have
made And then Mr Corleone may
very well by liable for indictments
of perjury However this document
will be made a matter of record

Sir I would like you to take the

stand
Vincenzo stares at him uncomprehending There may just be
a shadow of contempt He doesnt answer
HAGEN

Sir the gentleman does not
understand English He would not
in any case take the stand He
came at his own expense to aid
his brother in his trouble He is
not under any jurisdiction of our
government and his reputation in
his own country is impeccable

SENATOR KANE

The witness is excused take him out

meant it He wouldnt divorce his
wife because she was a great
cook He said he girlfriend made a
spaghetti sauce once and it was so
terrible he knew he could never
marry her He set her up ina
house in Jersey She had to be
faithful and she had to have kids
And she did two a boy anda girl
He had her checked out and watched
so she couldnt cheat but the
girl couldnt stand that kind of
life She begged him to let her go

her give up the kids Then Frankie
took them to Italy and had them
brought up by his brother Vincenzo
Where he knew theyd by safe
