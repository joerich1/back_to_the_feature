TWO MOONS rise into frame floating over the jagged peaks

of distant mountains We are PANNING DOWN to the endless
red plains of MARS
2 EXT MARS RED ROCK DESERT (DREAM SEQ1) - DAY 2

TWO PEOPLE in space suits walk across the Mars surface down a
slope across a flat area and up onto a small ridge They
stand and look out over the Mars landscape They reach for
each others hand and look at each other

QUAID
I love you

MELINA

Then they hug each other and walk off

3 EXT MARS RED ROCK DESERT (DREAM SEQ1) - DAY 3

Quaid walks from the precipice down a gradual slope The
ground gives way underneath him He falls His visor hits
a rock A small crack spreads and the visor blows out

Quaid starts to decompress HHHHNh His breath is drawn
out His face puffs up Veins stand out in his skin His
eyes bulge His tongue protrudes His nose and eyelids
bleed

The woman rushes to him She kneels down over him They
clasp hands His eyes explo

Quaid wakes in bed sweaty and panting

A beautiful woman wakes up next to him Shes not the
brunette from before but a stunning blonde amazon -- LORI

LORI
Doug are you all right

Hes still disoriented

LORI (CONTD)
You were dreaming Its OK

Quaid starts to come back to reality Lori presses a button
and opaque walls dissolve into transparent windows WHITE
LIGHT gradually fills the dark room and the city becomes
visible outside

LORI (CONTD)
Was it about Mars
Quaid nods troubled Lore wipes the sweat from his brow

LORI
Is that better

QUAID

LORI
Poor baby This is getting to be an
obsession

Lori caresses him comforting then erotic Her lips dwell on
his muscular chest He starts to relax

LORI
(non-chalant)
Was she there

Amused Quaid plays dumb

QUAID
Who

LORI
The brunette The one you told me
about

QUAID
(laughs)
Lori I dont believe itYoure

Lori punches Quaid in the stomach and they wrestle playfully
but rough

LORI
Who is she

QUAID
Nobody

LORI
Nobody
(down onto him)
Whats her name

QUAID
I dont know

LORI
Tell me

Lori straddles Quaid and he laughs so hard he cant defend
himself

LORI
Its not funny Doug You dream about
her every night

QUAID
But Im always home by morning

Quaid grabs Loris wrists and immobilizes her in the infamous
pretzel grip

LORI
Let me go

QUAID
Aw come on babyYoure the girl
of my dreams

She stops resisting

LORI
Â»You mean it

QUAID
You know I do

Quaid lets her go and Lori entwines him in her long athletic
legs

LORI
Ill give you something to dream about

INT QUAIDS KITCHENLIVING ROOM - DAY

TWO LARGE BANANAS are liquified as they pass through a juicer
into a half-gallon pitcher

Dressed for heavy construction work Quaid makes the POWER
SHAKE to end all power shakes He grinds up fruits
vegetables buts wheat germ leftovers several kinds of
powder He pours in a dozen shelled eggs--glubglubglub--from
a carton Then he mixes it all together in a forty-horsepower
blender ZEEEEEEEE

Meanwhile The NEWS drones in the background

NEWSCASTER (0S)
On the war front Northern Block
satellites incinerated a shipyard in
Bombay starting a fire that swept
throughout the city Civilian
casualties are estimated to exceed ten
thousand The Chairman defended the
attack calling space-based weapons
the only effective defense against the
Southern Blocks numerical superiority

Quaid gulps down his breakfast directly from his jumbo pitcher
and walks over to the flat wall-sized HIGH DEFINITION
TELEVISION

NEWSCASTER
And more violence last night on Mars

Quaid lowers the pitcher watches with attention and walks

over to the table

ON TV FIREFIGHTERS put out a blaze at a MINE as ARMORED
SOLDIERS brutally beat back a crowd of MINERS The Mine
enclosed under a glass DOME

NEWSCASTER (0S) (CONTD)
where terrorists demanding
independence once again halted
extraction of turbinium ore

Lori comes out of the bathroom and walks behind Quaid to
kitchen She tensely watches the news as she makes her
breakfast

In a small corner of the TV screen we see a STILL PHOTO
VILOS COHAAGEN a middle-aged man of commanding presence
obvious intelligence

NEWSCASTER (CONTD)
With one mine already closed Mars
Administrator Vilos Cohaagen vowed that
troops would be used if necessary
to keep production at full capacity
At the press conference he emphasized
that

is

the

OF
and

As the INSERT OF COHAAGEN expands to fill the screen Lori
presses the remote control BONK The TV screen transforms

into an ENVIRONMENTAL WINDOW that look out onto a virgin
forest

LORI
No wonder you have nightmares Youre
always watching the news

Quaid and Lori sit down and eat breakfast

QUAID
Lori

LORI
Yeah sweetheart

QUAID
Lets do it

LORI
Do what
QUAID
Move to Mars

She stops buttering the bread

LORI
Honey do you have to spoil a perfectly
wonderful morning

QUAID
Just think about it

LORI
(exasperated but sweet)
Sweetheart weve been through this
a million times Youd hate it on Mars
Its dry its ugly its boring --I
mean really a revolution could break
out there any minute

QUAID
Cohaagen says its just a few
extremists

LORI
And you believe him

QUAID
All right forget about it

Quaid clicks on the remote control The FOREST PRIMEVAL is
replaced by aPRESS CONFERENCE ON THE TELEVISION

REPORTER (0S)
Do you want to give them independence

COHAAGEN
Absolutely not Mars was colonized
by the Northern Block at enormous
expense Our entire war effort depends
on their turbinium

Lori straddles Quaid seductively obscuring his view

LORI
Doug maybe we should take a trip

QUAID
Lori move

LORI
Theres lots nicer places than Mars

COHAAGEN
and its ridiculous to think were
going to give it away just because a
bunch of lazy mutants think they own
the planet

LORI
What about Saturn Dont you wanna
see Saturn Everybody says its
gorgeous

Quaid stretches to see around Lori She playfully leans with
him

REPORTER
Any comment sir on the rumor you
closed the Pyramid Mine because you
found alien artifacts inside

Cohaagen and the reporters all chuckle

LORI
We could take one of those lonnng space
cruises The kind with nothing to do

Lori traps him into a lonnng kiss

COHAAGEN
Pat I wish we could find some nice
alien artifacts Our tourist industry
could use a boost -- But the fact
is its Mr Kuato and his terrorists
who spread these rumors to undermine
trust in the government

Back to the studio

NEWSCASTER
Thats it for the news Stay tuned
for Christine and the weather But
first this

COMMERCIAL for American Express Dont leave Earth without
at

Lori finally ends the kiss

LORI
WellWhat do you say

QUAID
Im late

Quaid trudges to the door discouraged Concerned Lori
catches him before he can leave

LORI
SweetheartI know its hard being
in a new town but lets at least give
it a chance here Okay
QUAID
Lori dont you understand I feel
I was meant for something more than
this I want to do something with my
life--I want to be somebody

Lori strokes his cheek and looks into his eyes adoringly

LORI
You are somebody Youre the man I
love

QUAID
Bye

Quaid hugs Lori hard grateful for her love and support but
hes still somehow unsatisfied They kiss good-bye and
Lori watches him head down the hallway to work
LORI (CONTD)
Have a nice day

INT REKALL - MEMORY STUDIO - DAY

Quaid sits in a dentists chair in an office which is a
cross between an operating room and a sound mixing booth

An IV tube is connected to the back of his hand and he wears
a GREEN SURGICAL SMOCK over his street cloths

ERNIE a hyperactive young technician lowers over Quaids
head a burnished metal bowl at the end of an elbow arm He
has the air of an acid-head whos still out there

ERNIE
Just relax First trip

QUAID
Mm-hmm

Ernie carefully aligns the complex scientific instrument and
locks it in place

ERNIE
Dont worry Things hardly ever fuck
up

The door opens and a bird-like middle-aged woman enters ina
stylish pants suit DR LULL is too skinny and her hair is
too red She treats Quaid with impersonal conviviality

DR LULL

Nice to meet you

Dr Lull flips through Quaids computer chart

DR LULL
Ernie patch in matrix 62B 37 and

graphics on the computer screen representing memory trip
cassette covers We see pictures of slimy green Martians

QUAID
Two-headed monsters

DR LULL
Dont you keep up with the news Were
doing alien artifacts now

Dr Lull and Quaid share a facetious smile

QUAID
Sure Why not

The latest graphic appears on the screen a sophisticated
archaeological dig inside a red cave Dr Lull crosses the
room to get another laser disk She tosses it to Ernie who
examines the cover art with interest before plugging it in

ERNIE
Thats a new one

Dr Lull fastens straps over Quaid to hold him in place and
makes perfunctory conversation

DR LULL

Quaid nods and Dr Lull shoots him in the neck with the
medicine gun

DR LULL (CONTD)

Quaid begins to feel the effects of the anaesthetic Dr Lull
checks his vital signs

DR LULL (CONTD)
Your sexual orientation

QUAID
Hetero

DR LULL
Hmmm

adjusts to correspond to Quaids taste

22 INT REKALL - MEMORY STUDIO - DUSK 22
MCCLANE
(to Tiffany)
Dont let her leave

McClane strides into the memory studio ready to kick ass
but he pulls up short at what he sees and hears

Quaid shouts and thrashes about in the chair violently
struggling to break the straps that hold him down Hes like
a different person a caged animal

QUAID
Youre dead all of you You blew my
cover

Terrified Dr Lull and Ernie keep a safe distance from Quaid
McClane is merely aggravated

MCCLANE

DR LULL

cap

QUAID

MCCLANE

McClane walks up to Quaid and examines his eyes

MCCLANE
Mr Quaid try and calm down

Quaid breaks the strap holding his right arm and grabs McClane
by the throat

QUAID
(quietly menacing)
My names not Quaid

McClane choking tries to pry Quaids hand from his neck
but he cant loosen the iron grip

QUAID
Untie me

Ernie rushes over and unsuccessfully tries to wrestle Quaids
arm down using his full body weight McClanes eyes are
bulging

Dr Lull frantically jabs a SYRINGE GUN into Quaids thigh
and fires dose after does until Quaids grip weakens and he
passes out

McClane falls to the ground gagging Dr Lull goes over
to help him

DR LULL
Are you all right

McClane shoves her away and gasps for breath

DR LULL (CONTD)
Listen to me Hes been going on and

-- one to Harry and one to the other Goon facing him Then he
throws the goons holding him against the wall and cracks their
heads together before throwing them aside Then he kicks
Harrys gun out of his hand

HARRY
Son of a bitch

Then Quaid kicks the goon to his right in the stomach then
knees him in the face Then he karate chops the goon to his

left in the face Then he steps forward onto Harrys neck
Harry reaches up and Quaid grabs his arms and cracks his neck
by pulling up

Then the kicked goon attacks Quaid by grabbing his neck
Quaid gains the advantage and cracks the goons neck

with Harrys gun Quaid wrestles the gun from his and shoots
him in the back drops him and shoots the last Goon and runs
away

Lori Run

Quaid hides behind the BAR and peeks over the edge Bullets
shatter bottles and glasses all around him He creeps around
the bar and jumps toward the far wall His assailant fires
and looks for him with a flashlight Quaid lands behind the
dining table and goes for the chair next to the display
shelves As his assailant fires again Quaid throws a chair
and runs after it to attack the assailant Their fighting
silhouettes are visible against the window

A gun SKITTERS across the floor We hear a few meaty THUDS
then a painful GRUNT as someones breath WHOOSHES out

A LIGHT comes on and Quaid is standing there with one hand
on the lamp switch and the other arm circling Loris neck
in a chokehold

Quaid is astonished Devastated

QUAID
Lori

Lori elbows him in the ribs hits him in the balls then
punches him in the face She then continues her assault on
his pushing himbackwards along the kitchen counter

Quaid merely defends himself unwilling to strike his wife
Under this handicap he absorbs savage blows that would kill a
lesser man

As Lori winds up for the coup de grace he throws her over the
counter She flies all the way to the kitchen where she
lies dazed

Quaid recovers his breath

QUAID (CONTD)
Lori why are you doing this

Lori grabs a carving knife from the wall and charges Quaid

He tumbles away just in time She pursues him doing her best
to slice him open He disarms her and Lori still tries to
grab the gun on the floor Quaid gets to it first and holds
the gun to her head

Lori remains stubbornly silent Crazed Quaid shoves the
gun barrel in her ear

QUAID (CONTD)

Quaid pushes Lori away but keep his gun trained on her

LORI

Quaid tries to defend his sanity with an air of sarcasm

QUAID
OK then If Im not me then who

Quaid sits in a chair and rubs his forehead trying to decide
what to do -- how to react Lori is suddenly sweet and

The Bartender calls toward a table near the stairs

on the knee of a sullen unshaven fellow named TONY GEORGE
whos relaxed and confident sees the Bartender trying to get
Melinas attention He signals her and she turns around
laughing When she sees Quaid her laugh fades to shock

Melina bears an uncanny resemblance to Quaids fantasy
composite at Rekall

Melina sashays over to Quaid and looks him up and down
MELINA

She kisses him wet and sloppy and rubs up against him

MELINA (CONTD)

Tony grabs Quaids arm and theyre about to come to blows
when George defuses the situation

Quaid lies forlorn on his bed in the dark staring at the
TV but not really watching The blue light of the television
flickers against the somber red of the setting sun

ON TV COHAAGEN delivers a speech from his office

COHAAGEN
This afternoon at 430pm I signed an
order declaring martial law throughout
the Mars Federal Colony TI will not
tolerate any further damage to our
mineral export operations Mr Kuato
and his terrorists must understand that
their self-defeating efforts will only
bring misery and suffering to the people

startled by a KNOCK AT THE DOOR

Quaid sits up slowly on alert

VOICE (0S)
(through door)
Mr Quaid

Quaid picks up his gun

QUAID

VOICE (0S)
I need to talk to you--about Mr Hauser

Quaid COCKS his gun and approaches the door very cautiously
from the side

QUAID
Who are you

VOICE (0S)
Dr Edgemar From Rekall

QUAID
(stunned incredulous)
How did you find me

EDGEMAR (0OS)
Its difficult to explainCould you
open the door please Im not armed
All of a sudden Quaid flings opens the door and takes
hair-trigger aim atDr Edgemar from the Rekall
commercial Hes dresses in the same tweed jacket Quaid
keeps the gun on Edgemar and glances up and down the hall

EDGEMAR
Dont worry Im alone --May I come
in

Quaid roughly pulls Edgemar into the hotel room and closes
the door He frisks Edgemar and find to weapon

QUAID
What do you want

EDGEMAR
This is going to be very difficult for
you at accept Mr Quaid

QUAID
Im listening

EDGEMAR
Im afraid youre not really standing

here right now

Quaid cant repress a chuckle

QUAID
Ya know Doc you could have folled
me

EDGEMAR

Im quite serious Youre not here
and neither am I

Quaid squeezes Edgemars shoulder verifying its solidity

QUAID
Amazing Where are we

EDGEMAR
At Rekall

Quaids cockiness wavers

EDGEMAR (CONTD)
Youre strapped into an implant chair
and Im monitoring you at a psycho-probe
console

QUAID
Oh I get it Im dreaming And this
is all part of that delightful vacation
your company sold me
EDGEMAR
Not exactly What youre experiencing
is a free-form delusion based on our
memory tapes But youre inventing
it yourself as you go along

QUAID
Well if this is my delusion who
invited you

EDGEMAR

Ive been artificially implanted as
an emergency measure

(gravely)
Im sorry to tell you this Mr Quaid
but youve suffered a schizoid embolism
We cant snap you out of your fantasy
Ive been sent in to try to talk you

down

QUAID
How much is Cohaagen paying you for
this

EDGEMAR

Think about it Your dream started

in the middle of the implant procedure
Everything after that--the chases the
trip to Mars your suite here at the
Hilton--these are all elements of your
Rekall Holiday And Ego Trip You paid
to be a secret agent

QUAID
Bullshit Its all coincidence

EDGEMAR
What about the girl Brunette
athletic sleazy and demure just like
you specified Is that a coincidence

QUAID
Shes real I dreamed about her before
I even went to Rekall

EDGEMAR
Mr Quaid can you hear yourself
Shes real because you dreamed her

QUAID
Thats right

Edgemar sighs discouraged
EDGEMAR

Maybe thisll convince you Would you
mind opening the door
Quaid jabs his gun into Edgemars ribs

QUAID
You open it

EDGEMAR
No need to be rude Ill do it

Quaid shadows Edgemar as he opens the door

Lori stands in the threshold

Quaid does his best to absorb another shock

Lori puts on a brave face like holding back tears in front
of a sick child There is not the slightest indication that

she has even been anything but Quaids adoring wife

LORI
Sweetheart

EDGEMAR
Come in Mrs Quaid

Lori walks in hesitantly Quaid pulls her to him and roughly
frisks her

QUAID
I suppose youre not here either

LORI
Im here at Rekall

Quaid laughs and roughly pushes her away
LORI (CONTD)

(crushed)
I love you

QUAID
Right Thats why you tried to kill
me

LORI

Nooo I would never do anything to
hurt you I want you to come back to
me

QUAID
Bullshit

Loris heart is breaking but Quaids is cold as ice
EDGEMAR

Whats bullshit Mr Quaid
(reasonable)
That youre having a paranoid episode
triggered by acute neuro-chemical
trauma

(derisive)
Or that youre really an invincible
secret agent from Mars whos the victim
of an interplanetary conspiracy to make
him think hes a lowly construction
worker

Quaids certainty in undermined Edgemar looks at him with
great sympathy and kindness

EDGEMAR (CONTD)
Stop punishing yourself Doug Youre
a fine upstanding man You have a
beautiful wife who loves you

LORI
I do

Lori beams at him with pure affection
EDGEMAR (CONTD)
Your whole life is ahead of you
But youve got to want to return to
reality

Quaid is half-convinced but doesnt want to show it

QUAID
Suppose I dothen what

EDGEMAR
Swallow this

Edgemar opens his hand revealing a small pill

QUAID
What is it

EDGEMAR
Its a symbol Of your desire to return
to reality --Inside your dream youll

fall asleep
Quaid picks up the pill and examines it
QUAID
All right Lets say youre telling
the truth and this is all a dream
Realizing something Quaid raises his gun to Edgemars head
QUAID (CONTD)

Then I can pull this trigger and it
wont matter
LORI
Doug dont

Edgemar remains preternaturally calm His eyes and voice
express his unselfish concern for Quaid

EDGEMAR
It wont make the slightest difference
to me Doug but the consequences to
you would be devastating In your mind
Ill be dead And with no one to guide
you out youll be stuck in permanent
psychosis

LORI
Doug let Dr Edgemar help you

Finger on the trigger Quaid is torn with doubt

EDGEMAR
The walls of reality will come crashing
down One minute youll be the savior
of the rebel cause then next thing
you know youll be Cohaagens bosom
buddy Youll even have ridiculous
fantasies about alien civilizations--as
you requested But in the end back
on EarthYoull be lobotomized

Quaid becomes totally demoralized

EDGEMAR (CONTD)
(firm)
So get a grip on yourself Doug And
put down the gun

Edgemar stares hard Quaid hesitantly lowers the gun
EDGEMAR (CONTD)
Good Now take the pill and put it
in your mouth

Quaid puts the pill in his mouth

EDGEMAR (CONTD)
Swallow it

Quaid hesitates Edgemar and Lori watch with great
anticipation

LORI
Go ahead sweetheart

Quaid is wracked with indecision Then he sees a single drop
of sweat trickle down Edgemars brow Abruptly he swings his
gun at Edgemar and fires
Edgemars blood splatters in a dense circle on the wall
Quaid spits the pill out onto Edgemars blood-stained body

LORI
Now youve done it Now youve done
it

BOOM The blood stain EXPLODES blasting Quaid backwards
through the air FOUR MARS AGENTS storm through the big hole

Instantly 3 is rising up behind Quaid and hits him on the
back of the head with his gun Quaid collapses and tries to

leg and they try and restrain him

Then Lori steps in and kicks across the face moves around to
the other side and kicks him in the balls He stops

prosthetic limb is a DEFORMED NUB with a few vestigial
fingers The mutant Lieutenant and the others look with
sympathy at Bennys handicap Benny then stretches out his

Youll remind him Doc

Pre-occupies with his work the Doctor answers absently

DOCTOR

See you at the party

Cohaagen and Richter leave the lab mightily amused

The WHINING noise now becomes truly terrifying Quaid and
Melina concentrate to fight the effects of the re-programming

DOCTOR
Keep still Fighting just makes it
hurt

Quaid bucks against the HELMET AND FOUR SETS OF METAL BRACKETS
which bind his arms and legs (FIVE HANDICAPS)

DOCTOR (CONTD)
If you dont keep still youll end
up psychotic

Quaid thrashes about in his chair The screws holding the
chair together start to loosen

In adrenaline overdrive Quaid rips the right armrest from
the chair It hangs from his forearm like an unwieldy splint
(One of five handicaps is gone)

The Doctor rushes over Quaid swings the armrest and drives
a long exposed bolt through the Doctors throat

Assistant 1 grabs Quaids forearm Quaid curls him into a
one-armed hug and snaps his neck

Quaid lifts the helmet from his head (Two of five handicaps
are gone) Assistant 2 behind him grabs his wrist Quaid
grips 2s hair and pulls him forward over his shoulder

2s head lands between Quaids knees Quaid cracks his skull
like a walnut

Quaid reaches over and releases the bracket over his left
wrist (Three handicaps down two remain) But Assistants
3-5 converge on him holding down his arms

Quaid sees that Melina is still fighting her brainwashing

QUAID
Hold on

Assistant 6 charges with a long metal pole Quaid pulls 5 in
front of him like a shield 5 is skewered

Quaid flings 5 aside reaches down unshackles one ankle
and immediately kicks 3 in the balls

Quaid stands up with only one leg still shackled

6 and 4 bait Quaid like a bear using the pole and a fireax
Quaid grabs the bole from 6 and uses it to block the ax

He then bends to unfasten the last ankle bracket The fireax
comes arching down at him

Quaid leaps clear just as the fireax lodges in the chair

Now free and unhandicapped Quaid faces 6 He sidesteps
a thrust grabs the pole and thrusts it into 6s head
It goes in one temple and out the other

Immediately Quaid pulls off Melinas helmet

Number 4 (the ax man) activates an ALARM and makes a run for
the door Quaid swings the pole tripping 4 so that he lands
directly on his nose

As ALARMS SCREAM Quaid runs to Melina and begins releasing
her from her many shackles

QUAID
Are you all right Are you still you

MELINA
Im not sure dear What do you think

Quaid is aghast Melina kisses him

Inside the Mole Benny is disturbed by a curious high-pitched
whine that cuts through the roaring and grinding

The drill penetrates the door of the cabin and bores into

Bennys chest The spinning tip of the drill emerges from
his back Quaid pulls the drill back out and drops it

MELINA
Quaid Get over here

Quaid runs over and joins her at the wall She points into
the cone

MELINA
Theres an opening

An open HOLE is in the stone wall

Quiad looks through it A dimly lighted object is visible
in the distance

QUAID
I knew it

Quaid climbs through the hole followed by Melina

INT REACTOR CAVERNABYSS - PRE-DAWN 152
and gets his first look at the alien reactor

Quaid moves through the hole and continues down a tunnel which
quickly widens affording a panoramic view of a great wonder
The alien reactor glimpsed in Quaids mind probe

Hundreds of geometric columns hand suspended in a graceful
draping pattern like metal stalactites in a vast mechanical
cavern built by giants The titanic construction is organized
into four groupings which radiate from a central core

Quaid stares with wonder and awe Melina appears next to
him even more impressed They look up at the alien reactor
The columns extend seemingly forever into the dark recesses
of the hollowed-out mountain

QUAID (0S)
Its all one big reactor made out of
turbinium

Quaid and Melina are standing at the edge of a steep cliff
next to the footings of a flimsy BRIDGE of human design
The bridge stretches from the cave wall over an abyss to
the core of the reactor

QUAID (CONTD)
Cohaagen knows it makes air But the
bastard wont turn it on

MELINA
Of course not If Mars had an
atmosphere hes lose control

Quaid starts climbing the footings toward the bridge some
eighteen feet above Melina follows him up the girders

QUAID
Ya see down thereIts a glacier

They are precariously balance over a seemingly bottomless
ABYSS

QUAID (CONTD)
The whole core of Mars is ice The
reactor melts it and releases oxygen
MELINA
Enough for everybody to breathe

INT REACTOR CAVERNBRIDGE - PRE-DAWN 156

Quaid pulls himself onto the bridge then reaches down and
lifts Melina

QUAID
Plenty

Standing on the walkway they look up at the gargantuan
reactor which looms ahead of them like Valhalla at the end
of the Asgaard Bridge

QUAID (CONTD)
If we turn it on in time

They start walking toward the reactor

Richter gives a get ready signal to THIRTY SOLDIERS who
lie in wait to ambush Quaid and Melina as soon as they come
inside

Come on Lets go

The soldiers spread out among the huge metal Sequoias that
extend down through the floor like pegs through a pegboard

enter He steps into view Richters soldiers reveal
themselves

BRRTDBTRBDRTRTDBRTDBDRDBTTDRDBD Richter and his men open

circle emptying thousands of rounds into his body

He reacts to the shots and goes down on his knees -- but
hes not dead He stands up laughs at the soldiers and
starts to walk away

RICHTER
Son of a bitch Hes got a hologram
Spread out

Quaid walks into one of the columns and disappears The real
Quaid appears and mows down a lot of the soldiers with

gunfire

Melina runs in to join Quaid shooting at soldiers Then they
split up Quaid running one way Melina the other

Quaid kills two soldiers as he runs into the columns Quaid
and his hologram appear at either side of a column

INT REACTOR - DAY

Quaid moves along among the columns and runs into three
soldiers He starts laughing

QUAID
You think this is the real Quaid Well
it is

Quaid then shoots them down and runs off

Melina and Quaid come together at one of the columns cross
each other and then go their separate ways She now has the
hologram watch Melina runs to another column peeks around
gets shot at then goes to the other side of the column

INT REACTOR - NEAR ELEVATOR - DAY

A SOLDIER HERE and a SOLDIER THERE see her walking They
both open fire The bullets pass through Melina and they
shoot each other

Quaid and Melina meet up Melina throws the hologram watch
back to him Quaid takes the hologram watch and runs up the
middle of a row of columns Richter runs across in front of
him and fires and misses Two soldiers pop out behind him
and Melina kills them Quaid continues after Richter

OMITTED

INT REACTOR CORE - DAY

Richter sprints onto an open FREIGHT ELEVATOR at the far end
of the area The elevator starts to rise Quaid jumps onto
the elevator and drags Richter to the floor

Melina runs over too late and watches the elevator ascend
at incredible speed with Quaid hanging below

Richter and Quaid wrestle savagely on the floor trying to
force each other over the side Richter lodges his foot in
a hole in the floor and shoves Quaids head over the edge

Quaid looks up YAAA The elevator is approaching a hole
Cohaagen cut in the metal shell which encloses the bunch of

thru

columns The hole is exactly big enough for the elevator

to pass through Anything extended beyond the boundaries

of the elevator--like Quaids head--will be sliced off

Quaid summons all his strength and throws Richter and himself
back into the elevator without a nanosecond to spare As

the elevator passes through the hole cut in the metal a sharp
edge guillotines Richters rifle in half Nasty

The elevator emerges in a narrow space between two concentric
curved walls The adversaries exchange blows Richter knocks
Quaid down then rushes at him Quaid flips Richter over

the side

But Richter grabs Quaids wrists and drags Quaid with him
Quaids foot catches a crater in the floor and halts their
mutual slide to death He hangs over the side bend at the
waist supporting Richter who dangles from his wrists

Quaid struggles to pull himself back inside but Richter
bounces up and down pulling Quaid further out

RICHTER
Youre goin with me

The elevator rapidly approaches another guillotine-hole cut
in the metal platform

Richter pulls at Quaid Quaid slips He gropes for another
foothold The metal edges are about to cut him in half

Quaids searching foot finds a hole He pulls back
The metal edges sweep by

AGAAGHGGHGGHAA A cry of pain

The elevator comes to a halt CHUNGGG

Quaid lies on the floor intact Still gripping his
wristsare Richters severed hands

QUAID
See you at the party

Richter falls to his death SCREEEEEEEEAMMMmmiinnnggg

Quaid walks to the other side of the elevator and rides up
amid the columns

Quaid walks out of the elevator onto a platform and finds

thru

himself in the CONTROL ROOM from Kuatos mind probe The
elevator closes behind him and descends

Quaid walks toward the round altar in the center of the room
At the center of the altar is the emblem of an open hand
Quaid reaches out for the mythic symbol

A light hits him and he stops his hand Quaid looks up and
sees Cohaagen step into the light holding a gun

COHAAGEN
Dont touch that Get away Get back

Cohaagen signals Quaid away from the altar He backs off

QUAID
What are you afraid of Turn it on

COHAAGEN (CONTD)
Impossible Once the reaction starts
itll spread to all the turbinium in
the planet Mars will go into global
meltdown--Thats why the aliens never
turned it on

QUAID
Do you expect me to believe you

COHAAGEN
Who gives a shit what you believe
In thirty seconds youll be dead
Then Ill blow this place up

Cohaagen shows Quaid a detonator in his left hand and points
with his gun to an explosive charge near the altar

COHAAGEN
and be home in time for corn flakes

Quaid makes a sudden move toward the emblem BANG Cohaagen
shoots and hits the altar near Quaid Quaid freezes

COHAAGEN
I didnt want it to end this way I
wanted Hauser back But nooo You
had to be Quaid

QUAID

stand that is wedged into the altar

Sucked through the air toward the hole Quaid desperately
snatches a length of cable HWANG His flight jerks to a
stop

Anchored Quaid makes a Herculean effort to climb UP THE CABLE
against the powerful wind
