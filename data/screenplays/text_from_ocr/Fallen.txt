EXT COUNTRY HOUSE NIGHT
A BODY careening toward the CAMERA

Lurches to a stop almost falls Eyes wild face glazed with
Sweat

HOBBES (VC NARRATION)
I want to tell you about the
time I almost died

Bright magnesium moonlight Behind the body‘s silhouette
shadow of a country house

HOBBES plunges forward again veering toward some bushes
HOBBES V0O NARRATION)
I never thought it would happen
Not to me
Not at this age
Falls to his knees dives face-first into the bushes

HOBBES (V0 NARRATION)
Beatenoutsmarted

Digs under the bushes clawing dirt like a wild animal
breaking branches cursing under his breath

HOBBES (LIVE)
God damn God damn God damn

Digging getting more desperate manic hes searching for
something and its life and death

Finally he sees it
Lunges grabs Car keys
Pauses to catch his breath Cant
Tries to pull himself up onto all fours Can’t
Glances toward the car makes one last effort to rise Cant
Spins falls onto his back Hyperventilating MOVE IN ON HIS
FACE 40 normally handsome now ravaged in pain
HOBBES (V0 NARRATION)
The name is Hobbes John Hobbes
Most decorated detective on the

Chicago police force and all that
jazz

HOBBES (V0 NARRATION)
But all the medals hard work

SLOW PAN from himto the surrounding landscape

HOBBES (V0O NARRATION)
How did I get in this fix
How did it all begin

Leaves rustle wind Supersaturated moonlight gives everything
an eerie cast like a photographic negative MUSIC emphasizes
a subliminal feeling we‘re seein ings which de not exist

HOBBES (VO NARRATION)

No no if I go back to the
beginning it’ll take forever
Lets start more recently

INT PRISON VIP VIEWING ROOM DAY

VIPs are assembled silent nervous How to behave at an
execution The room is rectangular with a one-way mirror as
the long wall looks into the execution room

‘Clock reads 757

The Prison Aide with the Camcorder is at one end of the room
best vantage point

The WARDEN and the GOVERNOR are exchanging whispers
Hobbes stands with Maguire Hobbes fiddles with his quarters
Everyones head turns

Reese is being led into the execution room by TWO GUARDS
Hypervigilant Casing the room the chair one-way mirror
He spreads his arms wide facing the mirror we hear perfectly

REESE
Howdy ladies Gents
Cocksuckers and pederasts

He slows his entrance blowing kisses toward the mirror

REESE
Hope you like the show
(another kiss)
Hello Gov my love

GOVERNOR
(irritated to WARDEN)
Hes certainly enjoying himself

WARDEN
Since he’s been in he’s started
a fire a rict and founded a KKK
unit Were very pleased to see
him graduate

The Guards strap Reese into the chair securing his hands and
feet Another Guard a REDHEAD is watching

When the first two Guards retreat the Redhead steps forward
checks everything

As the Redhead leaves his hand trails casually up Reeses
arm

Reese is smiling His lips seem to he moving

The Redhead enters a cubicle at the end of the room glances up
at the clock 759 He sits behind a small monitor and we
realize this is the executioner

A sound is coming from Reese -

GOVERNOR
What’s he doing

ANOTHER PRISON AIDE
He’s I believe he’s singing sir

Reese increases his volume the old Rolling Stones song
REESE
Timeis on my side
Yes it is
Timeis on my side
You know it is (etc)
His singing becoming more raucous inappropriate

The VIPs getting more uncomfortable Not the solemn spectacle
theyd anticipated

Sweep second hand on the clock getting closer to the 12 closer
to 800 am

Reese sings loud and wild a maniac with good pipes
REESE

T1ll come runnin’ back

Ill come runnin’ back
The Redhead is staring at the Warden waiting for the okay
The Governor enraged by the singing elbows the Warden do it
The Warden nods Yes yes but not until He waits waits
The second hand hits the 12 -
Warden nods
The Redhead throws the switch -
Pellets clatter down -
A cloud of cyanide gas billows -

Reese holds his breath bulging cheeks as the gas rises
sensuous and deadly around him

Scanned and converted to PDF by SCREENTALK Magazine - wwwscreentalkbiz
Turns toward his audience Last grin

Gives ‘em the finger -

Violently sucks in the poison

His body shakes -

Faces of the Observers Repelled excited transfixed

After a long moment their expressions change Shocked
aftermath It’s over so fast

Reeses body Slumped The CAMERA MOVES across it as if to
say subtly something is still happening We come to rest on

HIS LEFT HAND A final muscular twitch just the pinkie

OVERHEAD SHOT TIGHT ON REESE collapsed in his chair In an
odd effect SOUND becomes distant muted

The CAMERA RISES TO THE CEILING AND MOVES Over to the
Warden chatting with the Governor It hovers over him then
MOVES AGAIN over the Governor himself lingers

and slides away out of the room

into the next room the Executioner’s cubicle

The CAMERA ARCS DOWN onto the Redheads face SOUND eases back
to normal The Redheads jotting a few notes For the first
time we get a good look at him 28 boyish efficient

The Warden sticks his head in the door

WARDEN
You okay Jimmy

JIMMY (REDHEAD)
hint of admiration)
Never saw one sing before
For the Governor’s sake the Warden acts like a good guy

WARDEN
Take the rest of the day off huh

The Warden closes the door and Jimmy smiles to himself Stares
at the door Hold this 12 second too long -

Maguire and Hobbes walking to their cars

MAGUIRE

MAGUIRE

This ain’t your fault

Hobbes smiles appreciating it gives Maguire a friendly cuff
with the back of his hand As Hobbes gets into his’ car

THE CAMERA PANS Driving slowly toward them in an old
convertible is Jimmy the Redheaded Executioner As he passes
he gives them a casual glance Contrary to what we expect
The CAMERA MOVES AWAY with him as he sings to himself
JIMMY THE EXECUTIONER

From an OVERHEAD ANGLE we watch Jimmy stroll along whistling
MUSIC tells us subtly something odd is happening

Jimmy stops buys a bagel and walks on eating it

As he walks his hand brushes casually against a BUSINESSWOMAN
coming the other way

The CAMERA EXECUTES A 20 DEGREE REVERSE TURN FOLLOWS the
Businesswoman Crisp efficient walk After a few steps

She touches a SMALL BOY holding his MOTHER’s hand

We FOLLOW the Mother and Boy They wander slowly looking in
store windows chatting The Mother’s shoulder bumps against
a thin ANOREXIC MAN with a scruffy beard

The Mother and Boy move on We HOLD on the Anorexic Man as he
stops looks aroundstands up a little straighter

ANOTHER ANGLE

Facing the Anorexic Man Thin smile He checks his watch

Before he was casually dressed now he’s in a suit

Incongruous with his present appearance the apartment around
him is in disarray books strewn furniture knocked over as if
it was recently the scene of an enormous struggle

on the wall beside Charles out of focus something is scrawled
in magic marker

Charles sets his spoon in the bowl
He looks down There are four - and only four - objects on the

table cornflakes milk carton sugar bowl and in the center
the bowl of half-eaten cereal

He adjusts the angle of the cornflakes box moves the milk
carton slightly

like Stonehenge

May IT come in a moment

She looks at his badge then again at his face Says nothing

HOBBES (CONT )
I want to ask about your father

Her face reacts Here it is the moment she’s long expected

She walks away leaving the door open for him to follow

INT GRETTA’S APARTMENT EVENING

Like a loft high ceilings The evening light gives the white
walls a soft glow This effect is intensified by the art work
massive reproductions of Raphaelite and Pre-Raphaelite angels

The impact is quite striking and Hobbes comments

HOBBES
The files on his case are sealed

She seems to have no reaction

HOBBES (CONT)
Even now 30 years later my
boss wont say anything

GRETTA
Good
(considers then)
Mr Hobbes I could tell you what
my mother told me before she died

HOBBES
Im sorry - (about her death)

GRETTA
She’s not But first I have to ask
again why do you want to know Is
it idle curiosity or -

HOBBES
No See Im the guy who caught
Edgar Reese who was just executed -
GRETTA
Yes I read about - (him)
HOBBES

Reese kind ofgave me your
father’s name

She looks at him rather blankly says softly

One condition you and I never spoke
No reports nothing in the files
My name and everything I say is

GRETTA
Yes Im thinking that perhaps
youre here for a purpose you
yourself don‘t yet see

He starts to respond to this but before he can get a word out
she launches into her story

GRETTA

According to my mother who was
admittedly biased my father was
the best cop on the force Smart
dedicated incorruptible
He received an award for catching
someone named the Kiddo Killer
who was preying on

there’s more she could say

but this will suffice
small boys After Kiddo was
executed copy-cat crimes occurred
My father was implicated The
evidence against him mounted phone
calls fingerprints witnesses He
went kind ofcrazy Bought a
house up in Canadawent there
and shot himself

HOBBES
idly
Can I go up to the house

GRETTA
(subtly paranoid)
Why

HOBBES
(picking up something)
Why not

She nods taking this under advisement and proceeds with her
story

GRETTA
The Department told my mother - for
the sake of her pension and my
fathers good name all he‘d done
for the force - they’d hush it up
I guess they‘re still keeping their
word

Hobbes neds

GRETTA (CONT
Please understand Mr Hobbes that
everyone including my parents saw
the evidence against my father and
considered it incontrevertible

She leans forward She locks him right in the eye and speaks
quietly but with enormous intensity

GRETTA (CONT)
But I know - for a fact - that my
father was innocent of those crimes

HOBBES
How do you know

She stares at him

HOBBES
How do you know he was innocent

GRETTA

‘Cause I know who did it
And I think you’re next Mr Hobbes
Im afraid you’re next
Thats all I can tell you

(stands)
In fact that’s more than I can
teil you

She walks toward the door

HOBBES
Wait a second You were suggesting
before that there might be some
other reason I’m here

She gives the slightest of nods as she opens the front door

HOBBES (CONT )
I don’t understand

It was nice to meet you

Walks down the street lost in thought (There should be a

human beings have is to figure out
what the hell is going on CONT

Though we don’t pay attention at this point a MAN is strolling
up the street toward Hobbes

What was she hiding
What was she afraid of
Why did she end things so abruptly
And her final words Go with God

consciousness

On his back as he walks away from the camera

One never knows down to the smallest
thing The man who catches your eye
in the street Does he know you
Did you go to high school together
or is he a stranger Is he a
homicidal maniac who hates your guts
on sight or is he thinking about
robbing you or is he (just) some
poor creature trying to make a
homosexual advance (CONT

room -

Art and Sam have fallen asleep in front of the tv which is now

Without any reaction or comment he hangs up These calls are
such a routine occurrence Art barely notices them

Salvation-Army-style furniture but nothing’s in the right
place The desk is in the middle of the room Chairs are
turned over There’s plaster on the floor from a place where

one wall was torn up Every drawer is pulled out onto the
floor and old papers are scattered everywhere

INT MILANO’S HOUSE KITCHEN

Hobbes looks in Empty barren as if it had never been used
Hobbes notices marks on the floor He sweeps away the dirt
Gradually to creepy effect the painted outline of a sprawled
body becomes discernible this is where Milano died

INT MILANO’S HOUSE BATHROOM

Empty spartan Movement The ancient shower curtain is
moving slightly Something or someone is behind it

Hobbes hesitates

Steps forward

Yanks it back -

An empty tub On the wall over it is a broken window the
curtain was moving in the breeze

INT MILANGS HOUSE LIVING ROOM

Hobbes sits among the papers slowly sifting through them
He picks up one covered with some form of ancient writing
A second piece of paper has similar writing

He turns a sheet of paper over it’s a photograph

Ke holds it up to the light sees

Afamily Father mother three-month-old child A joyous -
now ironically joyous - image

ANOTHER ANGLE

Hobbes stands by a bookcase Only one shelf is filled with
old books oF

Hobbes takes one down leafs through it Photographs of
paintings and drawings Demons gargoyles monsters

Hobbes leafs through a second book a large one with photos of
churches He’s about to put the book back when he notices an 8
x 10 black-and-white photograph wedged into it

He takes out the photo examines it

A CRUDE PAINTING At the top are angels Some seem to be
pushing others out expelling them from Heaven The ones who
were expelled fall toward the bottom of the painting Their
arms are outstretched fingers pointing at almost touching
the men and women waiking along the bottom of the painting
The men and women’s faces are filled with horror and griet

Hobbes removes the photo closes the book looks around
He moves to the hall glances for a last time into the
bathroom into the bedroom

INT BEDROOM DAY

Casually to check every possible contingency he pulls down
the sheet thats covering one wall of the bedroom

Under the sheet is the painting he just saw Full sized in
color its powerful creepy

Hobbes stares at it Blinks
Looks down at the photograph

He‘s comparing them looking back and forth Hes noticed
something

He goes to the window holds the photo up to the light He’s
looking at the lower right corner

In the photograph that corner is white perhaps unfinished

But not in the painting The painting is complete

INT KITCHEN

In the back of the kitchen is a pantry Most of the shelves
hold old cans of food etc

one shelf is filled with paint and brushes From this shelf
Hobbes grabs a can of turpentine
INT BEDROOM DAY VARIOUS ANGLES

Hobbes is using the turpentine and an old rag to remove the
surface paint from the lower right corner of the painting

Gradually he uncovers the white wall underneath
But the wall is net entirely white

Underneath the surface layer of paint over one section of the
white wall something is written in smali black letters

Hobbes applies more turpentine rubs harder harderuntil the
letters are visible

We watch the demon move And we see though Hobbes does not

watching them through a speckled mass of bushes branches
This is the POV of the demon

EXT PRECINCT DAY
From across the street

Gretta nods smiles thanks Hobbes for a nice time He goes
inside We hear someone whistling And what he’s whistling
sends a chill up us for it is the same EERIE TUNE that has
been playing each time the demon is around

Gretta moves down the street

The DEMON’S POV moves after her He continues whistling
MUSIC underscores the tune

Gretta’s strolling happily looking in windows enjoying time
ourside of time

DEMON’S POV moves diagonally across the street to her side
Moving quickly now closing ground

She stops to look in a store window

The CAMERA gains more ground then has to stop because Gretta
can see the Demon peripheral vision The whistling ceases
THE CAMERA turns looks into another shop window lingerie)
HOLD a beat then PAN AGAIN

Gretta’s back on the move

The CAMERA follows slowly at first then closing quickly
ominously -

Now only a few feet away -

section

The CAMERA hesitates looks through the door a half-dozen
shoppers inside milling around

The CAMERA pushes forward into the revolving door The
demon is entering the store

But as the demon enters the CAMERA stays outside pans down

the revolving door comes back aroundand delivers the butcher
knife back out onto the sidewalk

INT STORE DAY

The CAMERA enters ag the demon then swings laterally and pulls
back so it’s NO LONGER THE DEMONS POV

We see everyone in the store including Gretta Because of the
way the shoppers are milling around we can’t tell which person
the demon is occupying

A couple of people move close to Gretta as she stands at the
counter One bumps idly against her then another Is this

the demon’s touch Behind them

A PUDGY OLD WOMAN WITH THICK GLASSES think Hitchcock) enters
the store holding the butcher knife oo

This was on the sidewalk outside

Gretta sees the knife realizes she may be in danger -

by the handle as an assailant would) gives her a sweet smile

A THIN WOMAN makes a sudden movement putting herself in
Gretta’s path a collision is inevitable -

Like a halfback avoiding a tackler Gretta arches her body
slips past the Thin Woman -

The Thin Woman grabs the man (MOUSTACHE) in front of her -
He lunges after Gretta -

She’s rushing to the revolving door -

Hes right behind her reaching for her -

She pushes the revoiving door -

Mustache is about to touch her -

The revolving door moves -

But his hand is in her section -

It stops the door
His HAND inches from her wiggling like a squashed bug -
His FACE smiling at her -

MOUSTACHE

She shoves the revolving door It won’t budge
His hand strains toward her
MOUSTACHE
(smiling)
Just tell me who you are

Bewilderment and fear on Sams face Hobbes is a little rough
out of control -

SAM
Uncle John

Hobbes sees that Sam is now clear of the demon

HOBBES
Where’s Toby

SAM
Ahh Still outside I guess

Hobbes drops Sam and sprints away down the hall

EXT HOBBES’ APARTMENT BUILDING EVENING
Hobbes runs out of the building sees
Toby sitting on the hood of a car reading Hobbes’ address book

HOBBES
Leave them alone

Toby smiles which of course makes Hobbes even more enraged

HOBBES
Leave my family alone

TOBY
Why You come after me I come
after you and yours
Enraged Hobbes runs toward him -
Toby runs too - with the speed of youth

Hobbes sprinting as fast as he can -

Tobys going even faster He swerves into the street weaving
recklessly through traffic -

Hobbes watches alarmed -

Cars honk and hit their brakes - but Toby is smooth fearless
He makes it across

A SCRAWNY MAN has stopped to watch Toby’s dare-deviling Toby
runs near him lunges grabs his arm

The Scrawny man moves away and Toby stops to catch his breath
Hobbes passes him Like a concerned parent

HOBBES
Go home Toby

Up ahead the Serawny Man reaches in the open window of a big
American car unlocking the door He gets in -

Hobbes walks toward the car

ANOTHER ANGLE

Facing the American car In the right side of the frame
Hobbes is walking toward the car

Left side of frame the Scrawny Man opens the glove
compartment sets something on the dash He rips open his
shirt and hunches over hes doing gomething we can’t see -
Hobbes getting nearer nearer -

The Scrawny Man working on his chest Something glints on the
dashboard What he placed there a pistol

ANOTHER ANGLE

SHOCK The Scrawny Man leaps out fires at Hobbes

Hobbes jumps to one side -

Scrawny Man keeps shooting

Hobbes falls rolls behind a parked car draws his gun
Silence

Hobbes gets up crouches He’s unharmed

He peeks out instantly pulls back

Then looks out again

The Scrawny Man is standing in the middle of the street
His pistol is pointed at the ground
His face is curiously blank
SCRAWNY MAN

Whats a matter pal (you) afraid

to fight me
Hobbes thinks
Composes himself
Steps out from behind the car
Face to face Gunfight on Elm Street
The Scrawny Mans face curls into a smile

SCRAWNY MAN

I knew you’d come out

I know you Hobbes

I know who you are

(contemptuously)

Wwa je-dow Nee Shu-shay
Hobbes reacts to the Mandarin -
The Serawny Man starts to slowly raise his gun Very slowly
A long suspended moment Should Hobbes kill the demon or
The Scrawny Man‘s gun is rising slowly inevitably
Then his arm jerks up aiming -
Hobbes whips his own gun up fires -
The Scrawny Man spins fails
Lies motionless
Hobbes comes tentatively toward the body
Looks down at it A collapsed hunk of flesh

Hobbes squats feels the neck no pulse

He sighs with relief and almost a smile believing he has
killed the demon

Most are reading the paper or staring off blankly But ten
yards down A SHORT MAN is also staring Something is up

She whirls frightened

Sees him

Is relieved and yet

She approaches the window with a touch of trepidation
He sees it

She reaches the window She’s still uncertain whether to undo
the security lock and open it the rest of the way

Hobbes sticks his hand through the open window The gesture
is - curiously horribly - reminiscent of the man with the
Moustache reaching for her

But of course it means something completely different Touch
me Trust me Trust I’m not bearing the demon

(blinks mutters)
You flew up huh
He parks gets out
He‘s got a FLASHLIGHT in one hand car keys in the other
As he goes toward the house he flicks the keys into the
bushes The action is so quick and minimal that someone at a
distance wouldnt read it
He walks up onto the porch glances in the window
Its dark inside no sign of anyone
Hobbes moves to one side of the door (in case someone comes

out) leans against the wall of the building shouts cut into
the darkness

JONESY (0S
Do what he says Hobbes

Hobbes whirls around Sees Jonesy Mutters

HOBBES
Two of you

This doesn’t fit his plan He looks back and forth between
them trying to decide which one is Azazel and then focusses
on his partner

HOBBES
(pained at the idea)
Jonesy (Are you Azazel)

Jonesy says nothing

The other men are on opposite sides of Hobbes 40 yards apart

and so far both of them are in character
Hobbes carefully takes out nis gun drops it stalls for time

HOBBES

Half beat

JONESY
You‘re quite right Mack I don’t
know what got into me
(steps forward)
Sorry Hobbes
(raises his gun aims)
I gotta put on the cuffs

Jonesy moves forward

Hobbes’ eyes are shifting he’s trying to figure cut how to
escape And which - if either - of these men is the demon

Jonesy stops 20 feet from Hobbes Still aiming his pistol
right at him so Hobbes has no chance to run

An odd frozen moment Why did Jonesy stop
JONESY
You know Maguire
Life is chock full of surprises

Jonesy moves his gun just five degrees - from Hobbes to
Maguire

Maguire frowns
Jonesy shoots

A look of complete astonishment on Maguire’s faceand he
falls dead

Hobbes is also stunned Is this the real Jonesy oc the demon

HOBBES
Whyd you do that

JONESY
(casually)
Come on I’m your partner
(gestures toward woods)
Go on you’re free Run

Hobbes looks at the woods then back at Jonesy He isnt sure

If he runs and Jonesy is the demon won’t Jonesy shoot him in
the back

JONESY
(smiles)
Keep thinking Hobbes

Hobbes‘ expression changes he suspects -

JONESY
(nasty amused)
So Now Jonesy‘s fucked too
He just shot his boss

Hobbes dives through the closed window into Milanos house -
Jonesy laughs
He walks casually toward the house

JONESY (CONT )
How ‘bout that Hobbes
Youre fucked Jonesy’s fucked
One at a time eh Thats how
we get you One by one

Jonesy moves around the house glancing quickly in windows
as if trying to draw Hobbes’ fire

JONESY (CONT )
See the deal (If) IT kill you it’s
the final pathetic chapter in the
life of another disgraced hero
Youre just one more piece-of-shit
human scum (CONT ) a

Jonesy comes to the kitchen door Standing to one side he
throws it open

JONESY (CONT
(cheerfully)
Or turn it around If I die Ill

He jumps

Jonesy hurtles into the kitchen eyes dancing with
anticipation he loves this shit

JONESY (CONT )

His eyes have adjusted to the darkness He sees no sign of
Hobbes Gun lowered he steps from the kitchen into

INT MILANOS HOUSE LIVING ROOM NIGHT
He enters lecks around sees nothing
Slowly he raises his pistol toward his own head

JONESY (CONT )
Sure you can

His gun moving slowly inevitably toward his temple

JONESY (CONT )
Maximum fun is
(with a big smile)

Just before the barrel reaches his skull -
Hobbes flies at him out of the darkness -
They careen to the floor - oe

They’re wrestling over Jonesys pistol Varying shades of
blackness a few streaks of slashing mooniight Their bodies
entwined grappling Visually it feels like were watching
something mythic

HOBBES

JONESY
Fuck you and fuck your heart
and fuck your soul
And thats a promise

iis

Is Jonesy weakeningor is it intentional the pistol is now
pointed at his head

But Hobbes does not fire Why He keeps pushing the point of
the gun lower lowertill it’s aimed at “Jonesy’s chest

A wrenching burst of energy The men fly apart as the gun goes
off -

Silence We can’t tell who was hit Both bodies lie immobile
in the darkness

We HEAR Jonesy laugh
Hes on the ground Bleeding
Hobbes appears over him

JONESY
(pained playful)
Eww you got me Hobbes
But isn‘t that just ego huh to
want to kill me yourself
What difference’s it make

HOBBES
Not much (CONT )

Hobbes takes a cigarette pack from his shirt pocket Knocks
one out lights it

HOBBES (CONT)

But sometimes little things are
important
‘Sides I want to talk

puffs on cigarette)
I think you were right what Reese
said Milano was just like me
And he was trying to do just what
tam That‘’s why he bought this
place seven miles from nowhere

(another puff)
But you didn’t get it did you
He didn’t quite pull it off so
you didn’t get it

JONESY
Get what

HOBBES

You didnt get it with him and
you still don‘t get it with me

Scanned and converted to PDF by SCREENTALK Magazine - wwwscreentalkbiz

JONESY
I don‘t get it and I don’t give a
shit

HOBBES

Don‘t you Open your eyes Azazel
Look around sometime

The way Hobbes says this is creepy as though he’s won For

the first time in any human body Azazel (as Jonesy) looks
nervous His eyes scan the room

HOBBES (CONT)
Dent you see anythingdifferent

Jonesys eyes come back to Hobbes puffing away
Jonesy stares at him
JONESY
(frowns)
You don’t
He stops talking overcome by a wave of pain

Hobbes smiles casually takes another puff

HOBBES
Whatd you say

JONESY a“
I saidyou don’t
talking with great difficulty)

Hobbes smiles again takes an even bigger draw a long and
heavy draw pulling the smoke down into his lungs

HOBBES

A horrible look of realization coming onto “Jonesy’s face

HOBBES CONT)
‘Cause cigarettes kill

JONESY
No

HOBBES

JONESY
Noocooa

He spins writhes his body contorting his eyes rolling back -
HOBBES
Ever hear of a scorched earth
policy An army destroys its own
country before the enemy invades
Jonesy’s body clenches
He glares at Hobbes
HOBBES
Seven miles from nowhere You
got no place to go but me
Jonesy starts to shakeharder harder
HOBBES
Come on Azazel Enter me and
we die together
Suddenly Jonesy has a huge horrifying spasm -
And stops Completely
Dead

OVERHEAD SHOT TIGHT ON JONESY ALL SOUND CEASES The
CAMERA floats up slowlymoves over Hobbes

Hobbes stares down at Jonesys body
ON HIS FACE as he waits for the demon
Very softly almost inaudible saying goodbye to this world
HOBBES
God bless you Gretta
God bless you Sam

He closes his eyes

His face starts to sweat We sense the invisible battle to
enter Hobbes

Very subtly his breathing becomes harder more intense He
takes another drag on the cigarettefrownswinces

SWOOPING DOWN VIOLENTLY ONTO HOBBES’ FACE -

He yanks the cigarette from his mouth hurls it across the
room -

His face hard enraged Hobbes is now Azazel

He staggers out the door Beside the door we see his
cigarette has landed on some scattered papers -

EXT MILANO’S HOUSE MOONLIGHT

Hobbes flies out onto the porch looks at the car in the
driveway pats his pants pocket - and then remembers Curses
Heads for the bushes

(HERE THE ACTION REPEATS FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE WHAT WE SAW
AT THE OUTSET OF THE MOVIE HOBBES STAGGERS FORWARD
SEARCHES THE BUSHES FOR THE CAR KEYS AS HE MUTTERS God damn
God damn God damn FINDS THE KEYS THEN TRIES WITHOUT
SUCCESS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THAT SPOT Under this)

HOBBES V0 NARRATION)
He‘d thought of everything Even
throwing away his keys ‘cause he
saw I’d parked far away so I‘d want
to use his car

His body crashes to the ground Falling onto his back His
hand moves to his chest -

self-righteous Chicago cop decides
he is going to save the fucking

His eyes flicker He’s fading And something else is

happening too his voice is changingbecoming deeper
raspier full of air The natural voice of the demon is

coming through

HOBBES AZAZEL (V0 NARRATION)

Thank God

Thank God there are other demons

We will prevail
He dies
Silence
Everything still and beautiful in the moonlight

The CAMERA DRAWS SLOWLY BACK FOR THE END OF THE FILM Closing
music startsand happy music too The audience must feel a
sense of real satisfaction Hobbes (the real Hobbes) has won
With his scorched earth maneuver Hobbes has killed Hobbes
killed the demon
We pull back farther fartherand ag if to cement our relief
“THE END appears on the screen
T instant these word appear there is a HORRIBLE NOISE -
The words are wrenched away -
Somethings moving in the moonlight A tail flickering
