Hi

elcome to the

theater

CONGRATULATIONS
Youll be working with
your creative team and
fellow cast members to
put on a musical Before
you begin rehearsals
there are some important
things you should know

This book is your
script Whether
putting on a school
production or rehearsing
a professional show
every actor director
and stage manager
works from a script Your
script contains some
additional information
like this introduction and
a glossary You can look
up any bold words in
the glossary at the back
of this book Be sure
to take good care of
your script and use a
pencil when taking notes
in it since what youll be
doing onstage can change during rehearsals

One of the first things youll need to learn is what to call the various
areas of the stage Since most stages used to be raked or tilted
down toward the house where the audience sits we still use the term
downstage to refer to the area closest to the audience and upstage to
refer to the area furthest from the audience Stage left and stage right
are from the actor’s perspective when facing the audience The diagram
above shows how to use these terms to label nine different parts of the
stage

synopsis

Early on a Monday morning in early
June 1962 TRACY TURNBLAD wakes
up to face another day full of hope and
big dreams (Good Morning Baltimore)
After school Tracy and her best friend
PENNY PINGLETON race home to
watch “The Corny Collins Show” a local
teenage music and dance show on TV
(The Nicest Kids in Town) On the show
teen idol LINK LARKIN pledges his love
to AMBER VON TUSSLE by giving her
his Council Member ring and CORNY
COLLINS announces auditions for new
Council Members Seeing her chance at
stardom Tracy plans to cut school and
audition for the show but her mother
EDNA TURNBLAD does not approve
Elsewhere Penny and Amber also argue
with their mothers (Mama I’m a Big Girl
Now)

Tracy goes to the audition but is
ridiculed by the girls on the show and
sent away by Amber’s mother and
show producer VELMA VON TUSSLE
Sitting in detention a frustrated Tracy
learns some new dance moves from
SEAWEED J STUBBS a black student
whose mother is MOTORMOUTH
MAYBELLE - the DJ who hosts the
monthly Negro Day on “The Corny
Collins Show” The next evening there
is a school dance and there Tracy is
able to impress Corny with the new
moves she picked up in detention
earning her a spot on “The Corny
Collins Show” During her debut Link
Larkin sings a song just for Tracy (it
Takes Two) Now a local star Tracy gets
an offer to be the spokesgirl for MR
PINKY’s The Hefty Hideaway a clothing
store Tracy gets her mother out of the
house for the first time in years as the
duo heads to the store to update their
wardrobes (Welcome to the Sixties)

ddSel

At school Tracy continues to be
teased by Amber and becomes the
target in a dodgeball game After
the game Link Penny and Seaweed
stay behind to help Tracy and there
Seaweed invites them to join him at
his mother’s record shop (Run and
Tell That) The Von Tussles barge in
and spoil the party with their bigotry
however this gives Tracy the idea to
integrate “The Corny Collins Show” by
having Motormouth and her daughter
LITTLE INEZ crash MotherDaughter
Day on the show Fears of police
and jail don’t stop Tracy from moving
forward with the plan

Unfortunately the plan for integration
lands all of the mothers and daughters
in jail (The Big Dolthouse) Everyone
gets out except Tracy who is denied
bail (Baltimore - Reprise) Link comes
to the rescue and professes his love
for Tracy while elsewhere Seaweed and
Penny reveal their feelings for each
other too (Without Love) The kids hatch
a plan to get Tracy on the nationwide
Miss Teenage Hairspray broadcast
and bring the news to Motormouth
who expresses that she will never stop
fighting for equality ( Know Where I’ve
Been)

Corny Collins begins his nationwide
broadcast ((t’s) Hairspray) and
introduces Amber for her dance
(Cooties) Just before Amber is crowned
Miss Teenage Hairspray Tracy and
her friends storm in and take over the
show (You Can’t Stop the Beat - Part 1)
Corny declares Tracy as the new Miss
Teenage Hairspray 1962 and Tracy
declares that “The Corny Collins Show”
is officially integrated Edna makes
a grand entrance and even the Von
Tusstes can’t resist the celebration (You
Cant Stop the Beat - Part 2)

Detention Is there no pity for a teen just trying to fit in

TRACY
I just realized who you are You dance on Negro Day

TRACY
Your mom is Motormouth Maybelle the DJ That makes you
like royalty Corny Collins is hosting the sophomore hop
tomorrow night If he saw me dancing like this with you

If you two danced together in public the only show youll get

TRACY
That’s why we’re all gonna do it together

LINK

Not me I like these people But whether or not they’re on TV
wont get me a recording contract

(LINK realizes this sounds too shallow)
That came out wrong I’ve been singing and dancing and
smiling on that show for three years waiting for my break
Saturday night is everything I’ve worked for I’m not gonna
throw it away C’mon

(LINK starts toward the door)

TRACY

TRACY

Oh Mama how could I think Link Larkin would ever care
about someone like me

EDNA
Why wouldn’t he Youre a beautiful girl It’s just boys are
not the brightest things Still you give him time I’m sure he’ll

WILBUR

Going to jail

MTI’s Broadway Junior Collection® Actors Script broadwayjrcom — 75
TRACY
I never would have gotten on the show without Seaweed No
it’s payback time

EDNA
But what if Ms Motormouth is right They could call the cops

TRACY
Don’t be silly Who’d call the cops on us Okay So this is how
were gonna do it We will meet at the studio

marching again and soon to the beat of a whole new era

VELMA
Bang your drum Bonzo No one cares You crashed the studio
once and got us all arrested But we won’t let that happen
again And don’t get anymore cute ideas about showing up at

Tracy Turnblad is herewith and forthwith withheld without
bail She is to be moved to solitary confinement and held there
until further notice by special order of the Governor’s office

(The MALE GUARD slams the cell door with TRACY inside)

WILBUR
I’m not leaving here without my daughter

TRACY
It’s okay Daddy They can’t keep me here forever Besides
I’ve got a lot to think about I might as well do it in solitary
