ONE NIGHT STAN

by
Joshua Friedlander

July 6 2009
EXT PARKING GARAGE ROOF - NIGHT

Its your usual balmy night in South Florida and there isnt
a single empty parking spot in this garage overlooking trendy
Las Olas Boulevard

In one of the spots a BMW rocks back and forth rhythmically
The windows are fogged over

The car stops bouncing for a moment

And then begins to rock again This time much more rapidly
This lasts for about twenty seconds and then all is still

The rear drivers side door opens and out climb a well dressed
but disheveled couple

The guy tucks his dress shirt back in The girl shimmies as
she pulls her cocktail dress down over her thighs

STAN KOOPERBERG is in his late 20s In spite of the tailored
suit and the expensive foreign car hes an approachable
regular guy The kind of man my Jewish grandmother would
call a mensch

JULIE WARNER is also in her late 20s Shes smart sweet and
surprising wholesome looking for someone who just finished
having sex in the back of a BMW The kind of woman my Jewish
grandmother would approve of - except for the fact that shes
a shiksa

Julie straightens Stans tie as she gazes into his eyes

STAN
I love you

JULIE
I love you too

As they kiss a mini-van packed with a large family pulls
up trolling for a parking spot

MINI-VAN DAD
Excuse me Are you coming or going

STAN
(deadpan )
We just came
EXT LAS OLAS BOULEVARD - MINUTES LATER

Hand in hand Stan and Julie walk the crowded street smiling
They enter a restaurant

INT TRENDY RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

Stan and Julie spot their friends by the bar and rush over
Their excited friends greet them champagne in hand

RUSSELL and MARIE (both late 20s) are Stan and Julies best
friends Until recently they were dating The tension between
them is palpable

NEAL and KAREN (both early 40s) own the video game company
where Stan works Theyve been married for 18 years The
tension between them is palpable

TRENT and BETH (mid 20s) are Julies brother and his new
girlfriend They seem happy

MARIE
Lets see it

As she approaches Julie holds up her hand to show off a
beautiful DEAMOND SAPPHIRE ENGAGEMENT RING

KAREN
What the fuck is that

JULIE
Its a beautiful sapphire engagement
ring

KAREN
God love you You cant let a few
dead Africans keep you from wearing
a real ring You shouldve gotten
her a diamond Stan

NEAL
She didnt want a diamond Not every
woman needs diamonds

Russell hands Stan and Julie each a glass of champagne
Congratulatory hugs all around

RUSSELL
I cant believe shes marrying you
of her own free will

STAN
I gave her a year and a half to figure
out that shes too good for me

RUSSELL
(teasing)
Thats plenty of time If she couldnt
figure it out in that long fuck
her She deserves you

STAN
Thats what I thought

MARIE
How did he propose Was it romantic
STAN
It was ridiculously romantic

JULIE
He did good He took me on the cruise
to the Bahamas He insisted we lie
on the beach and Stan is not a big
beach person--

STAN
I like the beach Im just not a big
melanoma person

JULIE
Anyway were lying in the sand
its a beautiful day The ocean is
gorgeous And I notice this skywriting
plane starting to write a message
And Im like hes spelling Julie
Hes spelling my name

Marie breaks down crying

JULIE (CONTD)
Are you okay

MARIE
Im okay Finish your story

Maries clearly not okay Julie tries to wrap up the story

JULIE
So it ends up spelling ‘Julie will
you marry me in the sky And then
this little parachute drops down
with a ring box
(Marie is bawling)
Marie are you sure youre okay

RUSSELL
Shes crying because its romantic

MARIE
Im crying because you broke my heart
you selfish fucker

RUSSELL
Okay Are we gonna do this now Are
you gonna make everybody feel awkward
Weve been broken up for two months

NEAL
You did cheat on her

RUSSELL
Everybody makes mistakes
STAN
Six times with four different women

TRENT
(joking)
Does that make it six mistakes or
four mistakes or just one big mistake

Trent gets the evil eye from all the ladies

BETH
The problem is youre still living
together Its not healthy

RUSSELL
I know
(whispers to the guys)
She gave me a blowy last night

A HANDSOME HIPSTER steps up

HANDSOME HIPSTER
Excuse me Im sorry to interrupt
(points at Julie)
I know you

Julie doesnt recognize him

JULIE
Maybe Im not sure

HANDSOME HIPSTER
Ive been sitting over there with my
friends and I know I recognize you
Did we

He subtly makes a little back and forth motion with his arm
implying they had sex Suddenly everyone is uncomfortable

STAN
Hi there Im Stan Julie is my
fiancée

HANDSOME HIPSTER
Yes Julie Im Doug Everett Although
you probably never knew my last name
cause it was just that one night Doug
We met at the Dandy Warhols concert

JULIE
Yes Okay Good seeing you again

Handsome Hipster gets the hint

HANDSOME HIPSTER
Oh Right Enjoy your evening

Stan watches him go back to his friends table and although
he cant hear him he knows hes bragging that Julie is in
fact the girl he picked up at the Dandy Warhols concert

KAREN
That was a little bit uncomfortable
STAN
Thats not the first time thats
happened
JULIE

It happened one other time

STAN
We bumped into a guy she had slept
with at Macys

TRENT
A similar thing happened to me and
Beth We were at the movies and we
sat next to a girl I used to booty
call before we met

STAN
No you misunderstand We were not
at Macys We were at the grocery
store when we bumped into a guy that
she had sex with at Macys

JULIE
(embarrassed)
Could we maybe not discuss this in
front of my little brother

TRENT
Like anythings gonna shock me

MARIE
Ive had sex in dressing rooms on
several occasions Everyone does
that Its nothing to be ashamed of

JULIE
We werent actually in the dressing
room We were in Home Furnishings
But it was after hours He worked
there

RUSSELL
Alright this is an interesting topic
of conversation Lets do this Where
was the craziest place youve all
had sex

STAN
Lets not
Russell points at Trent As they each answer everyone
politely applauds while they AD LIB approval

TRENT
Laundry mat

BETH
(bashful)
Ive only met you people a few times
I dont think Im ready

TRENT
Its okay sweetie Theyre not gonna
judge you

RUSSELL
Im gonna judge

BETH
Church

TRENT
Wow Nice Were gonna talk about
that later

MARIE

747 Cockpit not the bathroom

NEAL KAREN
Gondola in Venice

NEAL
On our honeymoon

Neal and Karen smile at each other briefly enjoying the
recollection

RUSSELL
Memorable Sweet that yours happened
together Mine is the bleachers of a
Yankees game during the seventh
inning stretch

Stans turn Hes uneasy

STAN
I dont know Im boring Probably
the backseat of my car fifteen
minutes ago

MARIE
Thats why you two were late

RUSSELL
Okay We already know the craziest
place Julies had sex so lets put
it to a vote Whos the winner
JULIE
Mmmmm if Im being completely honest
Macys isnt number one for me

Everyone looks surprised No one more than Stan

JULIE (CONTD)
I dont wanna give the impression
that Im into public sex because
Im not But other than the back of
Stans car and Macys There was
one time at Disney World On Mr
Toads Wild Ride

RUSSELL
Noooooo
JULIE
(ashamed)
Yeah
STAN
In the middle of the day
JULIE
Yeah
STAN
All the cars around you filled with
kids
JULIE

Yeah It was so inappropriate But I
was in college

TRENT
I vote for my sister She wins Im
proud of you sis

KAREN
Julie wins

They all CLINK glasses Except Stans Hes still trying to
figure out if his fiancée might be a slut

INT STANS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Twelfth floor of a highrise Picture windows Ocean view
Furniture from Z Gallerie

INT STANS MASTER BEDROOMBATHROOM - THAT MOMENT
Julie is in the walk-in closet getting out of her dress and
into her sleep clothes Ill at ease Stan watches her in the

mirror while he brushes his teeth Finally

STAN
How many
JULIE
How many what

STAN
How many guys How many guys have
you been with

JULIE

(amused)
If I remember correctly this came
up in casual conversation when we
first started dating I asked you
how many women youd been with and
you said that no good could come of
discussing our sexual histories You
said you didnt wanna talk about
yours and you didnt wanna know mine
You said some things should just be
a mystery

STAN
And I still believe that But ina
city of millions we keep randomly
bumping into guys that youve slept
with So I figure your number must
be pretty high

JULIE
Its not that high Less than yours
Im sure

STAN
Im not making a big deal about this
Im just curious You have stories
of fornicating in major department
stores and beloved theme parks Do I
really wanna talk about it No But
I already have more information than
I should so now I kinda need to

JULIE
(rolls her eyes)
Men

STAN
What is that supposed to mean

JULIE
It means that now youve suddenly
got images in your head of me fucking
every guy Ive ever met

Thats true

STAN
Thats not true You know what Forget
I asked It doesnt matter
Julie takes him at his word She begins to wash her face
Stan watches her Long beat He cant take it

STAN (CONTD)
Just gimmee a ballpark number

JULIE
(sighs)
I dont know About thirty

STAN
Thirty

JULIE
Approximately thirty You said
ballpark Now you want an exact
number

STAN
If you dont mind If its not too
much trouble

JULIE
Anything to make you happy Okay
Todd Mulligan was my first Eleventh
grade in my bedroom with the door
open while my parents were downstairs
watching Seinfeld

STAN
I dont want details I just want a
number

JULIE

I dont keep an exact count so Im
gonna have to think about it

STAN
Well I dont wanna stand here and
watch you relive them all

JULIE
This is a side of you that Im not
enjoying I thought you were more
mature than this

STAN
I thought so too Apparently Im not

Julie dries her face and walks into the bedroom Shes getting
a little frustrated but she keeps a positive attitude

JULIE
(thinking)
Alright there were three in high
school--

STAN
You had sex with three guys in high
school

JULIE

I started in llth grade Thats only
one and a half a year How many girls
did you sleep with in high school

STAN
One At prom

JULIE
I lost my virginity at seventeen
Im twenty-eight If you do the math
over eleven years my numbers not
that high Maries fucked more than
seventy guys

STAN
Jesus Does Russell know that
JULIE
What difference does it make They
broke up
STAN

So youve been with me almost two
years and you were with that guy in
college - the Bohemian artist guy--

JULIE
Devlin

STAN
Right Devlin the Bohemian artist
guy You were with him for a year
Factor in a few other six or eight
month relationships--

JULIE
Whats your point

STAN
My point is youve had four maybe
five monogamous years and then a

decent amount of fucking around

JULIE
I had a period of time when I was
wild I went on a little bit of a run
in college after Devlin broke my
heart I racked up some numbers I
dont have anything to apologize for

She gets in bed and pulls up the covers Stan switches off
the light and joins her Julie turns her back on him Beat

JULIE (CONTD)
So now its your turn How many girls

STAN
(hesitates)
Well Lets just say its in the
single digits

She turns to look at him

JULIE
Really

STAN
I heard the tone in your voice Like
you feel sorry for me

JULIE
No Im just a little surprised

STAN
Good night

Stan pulls the covers up Julie watches him for a moment
INT CYBERSCAPE CORPORATE OFFICE - DAY

A huge and colorful open space The office and cubicle walls
are Plexiglas so everything is visible

Theres a massive amount of semi-chaotic activity as ENGINEERS
and VIDEO GAME DESIGNERS work near GAMERS who test the latest
prototypes on 100 inch Plasma televisions

IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM

Stan Russell and a small group of EMPLOYEES huddle around
the new hi-tech coffee machine featuring a VIRTUAL BARISTA

VIRTUAL BARISTA
Hello May I take your order

One by one people order overly complicated coffee drinks and
the machine serves them up YVETTE a sexy twenty-five year
old squeezes in next to Stan She smiles at him

YVETTE
Morning Stan

STAN
Morning Yvette

Stan has some whipped cream from his mocha latte on his upper
lip Yvette wipes it off and then licks her finger

YVETTE
Congratulations on your engagement
STAN
Thanks Thank you

YVETTE
Its a little depressing for us single
girls that another one of the good
ones is off the market but I like
Julie Which is rare Because I
fucking hate most women

Neal enters the room

NEAL
Morning everyone Q3 profits were our
highest ever I was faced with a tough
decision I could either give you all
a huge bonus or I could buy this
ridiculous god damn coffee machine I
think I made the right choice

VIRTUAL BARISTA
Hello May I take your order

NEAL
As usual lets take a moment for
Russells office morale improvement
suggestion before we start the morning
meeting

RUSSELL
Thank you Neal This weeks suggestion -
I think we should implement sexual
harassment Tuesdays One day a week
where its okay to behave in a verbally
or physically inappropriate manner
with your subordinates All in favor

EVERYONE
I

RUSSELL
Its unanimous Ill have a memo
sent out to the rest of the staff

LATER

As everyone files out after the meeting Stan hangs back
with Russell and Neal

STAN

Can I talk to you guys for a minute
RUSSELL

Whats up
STAN

Being one hundred percent honest -
whats your take on promiscuity

RUSSELL
You know Im a whore

STAN
I know but do you think whoring has
had a positive impact on you as a
human being

RUSSELL
Without a doubt

NEAL
Youre a failure at relationships

RUSSELL
No I just havent found the right
woman Its all about finding the
right woman Ive given this a lot

of thought and the truth is I believe

very strongly in misogyny

NEAL
I hope you mean monogamy

RUSSELL
Right monogamy Sometimes I get
those two confused

STAN
I found out last night that Julies
had more sexual partners than I have

RUSSELL
Stan Ive known you since college
Youve always been a girlfriend guy
Everybodys had more sex partners
than you have

NEAL
I havent Between us Karen was my
first Shes the only one Ive ever
been with

RUSSELL
Thats horrible

NEAL
It hurts sometimes But I try not to
think about it Plus I was Karens
first so its equitable

STAN
I dont know why Im letting this
bother me Im being childish

NEAL
The number she gave you may not even
be accurate It could be less

RUSSELL
No woman lies about her number and
makes it higher

NEAL
No but she might be including guys
that she just blew Or guys that
went down on her that she never
actually fucked She could even be
including handjobs in that number
Which is just ridiculous I mean
Ive probably given five thousand
hand jobs Granted they were all to
myself but--

RUSSELL
Wait a second What youre doing is
called masturbating Youre not giving
yourself a handjob

NEAL
Why not If I was capable of blowing
myself you would say I was blowing
myself You wouldnt say I was
masturbating with my lips and my
tongue

RUSSELL
You have a point
(thinks)
If you could blow yourself would
you cum in your mouth

NEAL
No Id probably pull out and cum on
my tits

STAN

(dejected facetious)
Okay guys Thanks for your help

INT GRAND BALLROOM - DAY

An elegantly appointed ballroom with crystal chandeliers and
classical decor

Julie and GUY (30s handsome flirtatious) sit alone ata
table Spread before them an array of bridal magazines and
sample binders

JULIE
Im excited about the wedding but
Im not one of those women whos had
the whole thing planned out since I
was nine So youre gonna have to
hold my hand a little bit

He takes her hand and looks in her eyes

GUY
Dont worry thats what Im here
for Best place to start - lets
talk color scheme

Stan rushes into the room

STAN
Sorry Im late

He immediately notices the hand holding Guy doesnt let go

JULIE
Stan this is Guy Our wedding planner

GUY
Hello Stan I was just about to tell
your beautiful fiancée what Im going
to do for her

Guy flashes Stan a smile that says Im definitely gonna try
to fuck her Then he looks deep into Julies eyes again

GUY (CONTD)
Julie I will be your closest
confidant from this moment on Ill
be there to help you try on wedding
dresses

(Stan scowls)

Ill be a shoulder to cry on when
your mother-in-law is driving you
crazy Ill even be there when you
and Stan are fighting because it
seems like Stan just doesnt care
enough about the wedding

STAN
Why would that happen Thats not
gonna happen

GUY
It will But dont you worry because
Ill be there to pick up the pieces

Guys cell phone rings He gestures that he has to take the
call and darts away from the table for privacy

STAN
Hes kinda masculine for a wedding
planner isnt he

JULIE
He comes highly recommended

STAN
Dont you want a woman Or someone
gayer

JULIE
No I want Guy

STAN
Im not profiling here but when
youre talking about decorating and
shit as a general rule the more
homosexual the better I dont have
to tell you that You know that

JULIE
I asked around and I cannot find a
woman that was not extremely satisfied
with Guy

STAN
I bet

Guy returns to the table and rolls his eyes

GUY
Bride with dress issues Between us
its because shes a little on the
heavy side With a figure like yours
you are not gonna have any problem
If I were you I would think about
doing something a little sexy

JULIE
Really I dont know

GUY
Youve got a great body if you dont
mind me saying--

STAN
I mind A little

Julie gives Stan an annoyed look Guy ignores him

GUY
Youre a hot bride and youre supposed
to show it off This is your day to
say everybody look at me I know
you dont wanna talk dresses in front
of the groom but in terms of deciding
your color scheme its helpful to
know - will it be white

JULIE
Yes Definitely I wanna wear a white
dress

STAN

Can you do that Is that legal
JULIE
(confused)
What is that supposed to mean

STAN
Doesnt white signify something
specific Virgin Virginity If you
wanted a white dress you should have
crossed your legs eleven years ago

Julie cant believe he said that

GUY
There are no virgin brides anymore
Stan

STAN

Yeah but theres gotta be a cut off
By the time youve fucked thirty
thirty-five guys wearing a white
dress is just deceitful

JULIE
Stan can I talk to you privately
for a minute

She grabs him and drags him away from the table

JULIE (CONTD)
(gritting her teeth)
Call me crazy but I think we have
an unresolved issue

INT STANS BMW - LATER
Stan drives Julie tries to be understanding

STAN
Im sorry Im sorry Im sorry I
know Im being an idiot

JULIE
High single digits

STAN
Lets just say single digits and
leave it at that

JULIE
(surprised)
Low single digits

STAN
Before I answer can we clear
something up I just wanna make sure
that your number includes all your
partners Thats every guy

(MORE )

STAN (CONTD)
Theres not like an addendum to that
list of guys you just blew

JULIE
No Except with my first boyfriend
Ive never been one to just fool
around I always go all the way So
that number is all the guys Ive had
intercourse with

STAN
Okay

JULIE
That number doesnt include girls

Stan looks like he might faint

STAN
Here we go

JULIE
Dont freak out Ive only had one
same sex experience

STAN
You slept with one girl

JULIE
It was one experience but there were
actually five of us that participated

STAN
Five at once

JULIE
Yeah

STAN

Five Ive only been with four women
Youve had sex with more women than
I have

JULIE
No Im included in the five There
were four others

STAN
Oh so youve had sex with as many
women as I have That makes me feel
much better

JULIE
It was all one night A sorority thing
We were drunk there were five of us
that got together on a lark

STAN
You had a lesbian orgy on a lark

JULIE

(serious )
Stan Ive only truly been in love
twice in my life With Devlin and
now with you The rest were just
experiences Some fun Some kinda
gross But ultimately meaningless I
love you You make me happy

STAN
I love you too I dont deserve you

JULIE
I know

She kisses him And then kisses him again too passionately
to be safe while driving

INT STANS APARTMENT - LATER

Stan and Julie stumble in locked in an embrace and
exchanging massive amounts of saliva

They knock over a lamp as they fall onto the couch nearly
landing on FELIX THE CAT who SCREECHES and scampers out of

the way

They tear each others clothes off and hump like jack-rabbits
for a long beat until

JULIE
Uh Stan I dont think youre hard

He keeps pumping Felix watches him

STAN
I just lost it for a second but
itll come back

JULIE
I think youre gonna hurt him if you
keep doing that

Stan keeps trying for a minute but finally gives up

STAN
Great This whole thing is making me
impotent

JULIE

You think Ima slut

STAN
No I dont I swear I dont
(MORE )
STAN (CONTD)
Although I looked it up online -
only nine percent of women have had
more than fifteen sex partners

JULIE
I thought you were more open minded
than you apparently are Sex is
healthy Sex is good Youre acting
like a prude

STAN
Its not about how many men youve
been with Its about how many women
I havent been with My number is low
and Im locking myself in I dont
feel like I ever went for it I never
sewed my wild oats Of the four women
Ive slept with not one of them was
because I made the first move Ive
never even had a one night stand

JULIE
Maybe you should have told me this
was a problem before we got engaged

STAN
I didnt know it was a problem

JULIE
How could you not know

STAN
All I was thinking was that youre
perfect Youre the perfect woman

JULIE
Except for the fact that Ive had
thirty some odd sexual partners

STAN
No I dont hold that against you
Im sure that those experiences are
part of what makes you great And I
dont just mean great in bed I mean
all around great

JULIE
I hope you dont think youre
inadequate You know youre a
wonderful lover right

STAN
Wonderful

JULIE
Fantastic

STAN
Like number one out of all the guys
and girls youve had

JULIE
(brief hesitation)
Yeah

STAN
You hesitated That was not a truthful
answer

JULIE
You were definitely right about it
not being a good idea to discuss
this stuff

STAN
Am I even in the top five

JULIE
Im not saying that you arent number
one Weve had sex hundreds and
hundreds of times And its always
wonderful So--

STAN
No Everyone has that one time in
their life that they finished fucking
and they thought Holy shit That
was the best sex Ive ever had
Your hesitation tells me that your
one time was not with me

JULIE
Was yours with me

STAN
Yes

JULIE

Do you wanna break up with me so you
can go fool around with other women

STAN
No Never Somehow I tricked you
into falling in love with me Im
not letting you go

JULIE
You didnt trick me Stan Im fairly
smart You were chosen carefully
Were just having an issue All
relationships have them

She hugs him
STAN
(re his penis)
Look at that Hes back

JULIE
Lets finish what we started

They start fooling around

STAN
And hes gone again
(yells at his penis)
What is wrong with you

INT BRIDAL SHOP - DAY

Julie tries on an elegant wedding gown Marie Karen and
Beth sip coffee and watch her

BETH
Four Really Only four

MARIE
I knew that Well I didnt know
exactly Russell figured six

JULIE
You and Russell talked about how
many women Stan has slept with

MARIE
It came up once when you guys seemed
to be getting serious He said as
long as hes known Stan Stan almost
always had a girlfriend But this was
the first time he really seemed happy

JULIE
I knew Stan tended to have long term
relationships but I figured when he
was single he must have slept around

MARIE
Russell said the few times that he
was single Stan would insist that he
was gonna play the field but hed end
up spending years with the next girl
he met I assumed you knew all this

JULIE
No I knew everything but this Since
he found out how many guys Ive slept
with things have been messed up Like
cant maintain an erection messed up

BETH
Hes freaking out about the wedding
not about your sexual history

KAREN
When a guy asks how many other guys
youve been with you always lie
You cant possibly just be learning
that at your age You should know
that when youre fifteen

JULIE
I dont lie Thats not the way I do
things

KAREN

Well then good luck having a successful
marriage Listen to me when I met
Neal he was a virgin So I told him
I was a virgin Eighteen years of
marriage and to this day he thinks
hes the only man Ive been with
(sips her latte)
Im the cheerleader who fucked most
of the Varsity football team

JULIE
Why do guys have to make such a big
deal about sex

BETH
You think thats gonna end after
high school but it never ends

KAREN
They make a big deal about it because
its the one thing we truly control
You should have lied to him to keep
him in check Now youre just gonna
have to sit him down and tell him
hes missed his chance to get anymore
pussy and hes gonna have to live
with it

Julie looks lost
INT STANS APARTMENT - EVENING

Julie serves an impressive home cooked meal and then sits
across the table from Stan who pours the wine Julie seems
much more serious than usual

STAN
Looks delicious

JULIE
While we were dress shopping the
girls and I talked about our issue

STAN
You mean our private personal issue
(MORE )
STAN (CONTD)
(she nods)
Was Guy there

JULIE
No Would you stop worrying about Guy
(deep breath)
Listen Stan Ive done a lot of
thinking and Ive come to a difficult
decision

STAN
(panicked)
Please dont call off the engagement

JULIE
Im not gonna call off the engagement
I plan on spending the rest of my
life with you
(big gulp of wine)
Thats why Ive decided to let you
sow your wild oats

STAN
Pardon

JULIE
Ive decided to let you do the one
thing youve never done

STAN
(unsure)
Which is

JULIE
What does ‘sow your wild oats mean
to you Because Im pretty sure were
talking about the same thing

STAN
No We cant be

JULIE
Im talking about letting you go
wild With other women One night
no questions asked

STAN
You mean my bachelor party

JULIE
No We cant wait that long Weve
gotta get this shit resolved now
And Im not talking about lapdances
Im talking about fucking

STAN
But--

Julies trying to convince herself as much as shes trying
to convince Stan

JULIE
I want you to go out and have a great
time Because we love each other and
I know youll come back to me

STAN
Yeah but--

JULIE
The important thing is I dont want
you to have any regrets I dont want
you to enter into a lifetime commitment
regretting that you never picked up a
girl at a bar and brought her to a
sleazy motel Or whatever it is you
need to do Youre starting a new
chapter in your life and I dont want
you to start it with any regrets

STAN
This is insane

JULIE
Do as much fucking as you need to do
to get it out of your system Youre
a single man for this one night You
have until sunrise tomorrow to nail
as many women as you can

STAN
Tonight

JULIE
Tonight before I change my mind

Stans brain is fried He has no idea what to do

STAN
But I have a meeting over drinks at
seven thirty

She grabs his arm and his suit jacket off the back of his
chair and leads him toward the door

JULIE
If you give me any more time to think
about it I could come up with a
thousand reasons why I shouldnt do
this So you should leave right now

She opens the door hands him his suit jacket and his
briefcase off the entry table Then she pushes him out

INT APARTMENT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Stan stands just outside the door his mind reeling

STAN
What about dinner
JULIE
Ill put it in tupperware I love

Julie closes the door leaving Stan dazed Stan walks two
apartments down and knocks on the door Russell answers

INT RUSSELLS APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Stan rushes in past Russell
STAN

I dont know what to do Julie

I have one night to To sow my
wild oats To sleep with as many
women as I can I I I have

to go buck wild No consequences

RUSSELL
Wait a second Julie told you to
have sex with other women

STAN
She basically demanded it

RUSSELL

Just now Jesus she could have given
you a little more notice Alright
Well lets go get laid

Marie enters the living room topless with a towel wrapped
around her waste combing her wet hair She sees Stan and
quickly covers herself

MARIE
Oh fuck

Stan doesnt even notice His mind is elsewhere

STAN
Hi Marie

She scampers away
MARIE

Why didnt you tell me someone was
here

RUSSELL
You shouldnt be walking around like
that anyway Trying to entice me

STAN
I cant go get laid even if I wanted
to I have a seven thirty drinks
meeting

RUSSELL
What do you mean ‘even if you wanted
to Of course you want to Blow off
the meeting

STAN
Its too important You know that

RUSSELL
Listen to me Stan This kind of thing
does not happen Girlfriends fiancees
wives do not give you a pass On the
freakish occasion that it does happen
you have to go for it

STAN
I dont know

RUSSELL
You wouldnt have come over here
unless you wanted me to convince you
that you have to do it

STAN
(considers)
Im gonna go to the meeting Itll
give me some time to think
(realizes)
Marie has her nipples pierced I had
no idea

INT STANS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Julie sits on the couch looking comatose wondering if she
did the right thing

INT HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

Still frazzled from his talk with Julie Stan briefcase in
hand shuffles out of the rotating door into the busy lobby

He spots an UNATTRACTIVE WOMAN in her 40s wearing a pants
suit She sits on a plush couch focused on her Blackberry
Stan straightens his tie pops a few Tic-Tacs and approaches

STAN
Ms Lancaster

She looks up and shakes her head

LINDA (0S)
Stan Kooperberg

Stan turns to see LINDA LANCASTER 45 If you asked Stan to
imagine an attractive older woman hed picture Linda Now
hes even more frazzled

STAN
Hi Ms Lancaster How was your flight

LINDA
Long and bumpy Call me Linda And
lets go to the bar I need you to
buy me a drink

He watches her walk toward the hotel bar
INT HOTEL BAR - MINUTES LATER

Stan and Linda sit next to each other at the bar each with
a cocktail Lindas a tough cookie She watches a computer
simulation of a video game on Stans laptop

LINDA
My client isnt just interested in
how successful your company has been
Hes interested in working with people
he likes He trusts my judgment So
the most important thing you have to
do tonight is make sure I like you
Can you do that

She stares him down Stan stammers

LINDA (CONTD)
You seem distracted

Stans cell rings playing Boss of Me by They Might Be Giants

STAN
Im sorry Excuse me Its my boss

LINDA
He probably senses that this isnt
going very well

Stan forces a smile and walks a few paces away He answers
his phone

SPLIT SCREEN - Neal now shares the screen with Stan

NEAL
Get out of there or youre fired

STAN
What

NEAL
You only have about eleven hours
until sunrise

STAN
Did Russell call you

SPLIT SCREEN - Russell shares the screen with Stan and Neal

RUSSELL
Im on the line I called Neal because
I thought you needed to hear from
someone you actually respect what a
mistake it would be to blow this
opportunity

NEAL
Your fiancée has given you one night
to ruin everything you two have built
together Get busy doing that

RUSSELL
Dont say that Neal even as a joke

NEAL
Tell Linda Lancaster you have a
personal emergency and youll continue
the meeting over breakfast

STAN
I cant believe you both think
cheating on Julie is more important
than landing this project You know
what I should do I should call Trent
Hell be the voice of reason

SPLIT SCREEN - Trent now shares the screen with Stan Russell
and Neal

TRENT

Im already on the line
STAN

What
TRENT

Russell called me too

RUSSELL
I knew Id have to bring out the
heavy guns

STAN
Trent what do you think of all this

TRENT
I think my sisters a goddamn saint
for making you this offer
STAN
You condone me cheating on her

TRENT
Its not cheating if she told you to
do it Ima little disappointed
that she only gave you one night
But were not gonna look a gift horse
in the mouth

NEAL
Youve been given a golden opportunity
here Trust me shes not gonna make
the same offer one year or five years
or ten years from now Once your
married not only will you not be
having sex with other women you
wont even be having sex with her

RUSSELL
Dont fuck it up This is once ina
lifetime

STAN

Maybe its a trick Maybe I was
supposed to say ‘no honey youre
the only one I wanna be with

RUSSELL
You know Julie wouldnt do something
like that

TRENT

My sisters cool man She always

has been This is a little unorthodox
but all you should be thinking about
now is how many women you can tag in
one night

NEAL
In college I tried to see how many
times I could masturbate in one night
By number eleven I was ejaculating
blood So youre gonna wanna try to
keep the number under eleven

STAN
(rolls his eyes)
Im hanging up
BACK TO SCENE

Stan hangs up his phone and remains frozen

LINDA
Is there a problem

STAN
I think most guys wouldnt consider
it a problem

INT STANS MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT

Water runs into a nearly full bubble bath Julie enters the
room with a glass and an entire bottle of wine She drops
her robe and climbs into the tub

She leans back closes her eyes and tries desperately to
relax Its not working Her eyes pop open Felix the cat
hops up on the edge of the tub and stares at her Julie
squirms around a bit

JULIE
(to Felix)
I need to chill He loves me
Everything is gonna be fine Right

Felix doesnt respond Deep breath She closes her eyes again
and leans her head back Two seconds later

JULIE (CONTD)
(to Felix)
Hes not cheating I told him to do
it Its just sex Im not a jealous
person Its not in my nature

She grabs her cell and calls Marie

SPLIT SCREEN - Marie now shares the screen with Julie Shes
on her computer eating a Boston Creme pie out of the tin

MARIE
Its Friday night Im alone on
Facebook eating an entire Boston
Creme pie

JULIE
Im worried that Im starting to
lose it Im having a conversation
with the cat

MARIE
Does the cat speak to you

JULIE
No Im doing all the talking

MARIE
Okay so youre talking to the cat
but the cat doesnt talk back You
dont really need to worry until you
start hearing the cat respond

JULIE
Do you wanna go out for a drink I
did something really big tonight and
I need to get out of here

INT HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

Stan and Linda are served another round Things have lightened
up considerably

STAN
I realized in high school that I
just wasnt gonna be a guy who got
laid a lot You know

LINDA
I know what you mean

STAN
I had lots of female friends but
they never thought of me as more
than a friend Whatever that pheromone
is that makes girls wanna have sex
with you I apparently dont have
that I have the pheromone that makes
them wanna cry on your shoulder after
they have sex with some d-bag they
met at the mall

LINDA
I guarantee my high school experience
was worse than yours

STAN
As beautiful as you are I find that
very hard to believe

LINDA
I didnt always look like this And
every relationship Ive been in has
been an utter failure

STAN
I dated the girl who asked me to
Prom until I was a Sophomore in
college I didnt even wanna go to
Prom with her and somehow we dated
for two and a half years Then I
dated a total control freak until
college graduation She said if I
didnt propose to her on stage at
graduation she was dumping me So
graduation was the last time I saw
her Then a German girl accidentally
ran me over with her moped while I
was traveling around Europe We stayed
together for four miserable years

(MORE )

STAN (CONTD)
Then I finally met Julie and Ive
been happy until last week

LINDA
Youll be happy again after tonight
I think what shes letting you do is
extremely sweet and noble

STAN
Its good to hear that from a female
perspective
(long beat blurts)
Would you like to have sex with me

She looks at him with a slight smile Its anyones guess
what her answer might be Then

LINDA
I would but theres something you
should know

STAN
What is it

LINDA
Im pre-op Im scheduled for the
operation in a couple of weeks

STAN
Do you have cancer or something

LINDA
No Nothing like that Pre-op meaning
gender reassignment surgery

Wide-eyed Stan takes a long moment to process this

STAN
(loud)
Youre planning on becoming a guy

Everyone looks

LINDA
No I started there Im on my way
to becoming a woman

STAN

(disbelief)
Noooooo No Im not an idiot I
know what the signs are I know what
to look for You have no Adams apple
You have very feminine hands If
youre not attracted to me you can
just say so

Linda takes his hand and puts it up her skirt

STAN (CONTD)
Ohhhh
(he pulls away)
Was that a dick That felt like a
dick

LINDA
Its a dick

STAN
Why would you Why would you put
my hand on it

LINDA
You didnt believe me

STAN
Youre not wearing any underwear
(gathers himself)
Im sorry I didnt realize Its
because theres nothing masculine
about you

LINDA
Except my dick
(awkward beat)
If you want we can go up to my room
and jerk each other off

Stan stares at her mouth agape

STAN
Ill pass

INT STANS BMW - NIGHT

Stans driving and squeezing an excessive amount of hand
sanitizer into his palm He tries to make a call on his cell
without looking

MALE VOICE
Hello

STAN
Hey sweetie
(realizes)
Jules

SPLIT SCREEN - Stan shares the screen with Russell

RUSSELL
Its Russell Dont you fucking call
her Youre doing this tonight
Dont you fucking call her

STAN
I just touched a womans penis

He hangs up on Russell Stans cell immediately rings Its
his ring tone for Russell Time to Get Ill by Beastie Boys
He answers

RUSSELL
Dont you fucking call her Did you
say a womans penis

Stan hangs up on him again
INT STANS APARTMENT - NIGHT
Stan enters

STAN
Julie Im home

Stan finds Russell Neal and Trent sitting on the couch
drinking his beer

STAN (CONTD)
What are you guys doing here

RUSSELL
We used the emergency key you gave me

TRENT
This is an emergency

STAN
Wheres Julie

RUSSELL
She went out with the girls They
left from my place a half hour ago

NEAL
Just so youre aware I checked into
it and the sun rises at six fifty-
three am tomorrow

STAN
(ignoring Neal confused)
She went out

TRENT
Now that your meetings over its
time for you to start trying to get
some poo-nan

STAN
I already tried And it turns out
Linda Lancaster has boy parts Im
clearly not cut out for this There
are guys that have the gene for
snagging massive amounts of poo-
nan Im not one of those guys

(MORE )

STAN (CONTD)
Im the guy who hits on the woman
who has a dick

TRENT
All you need is a few pointers

RUSSELL
When youre not looking for a
relationship when youre just looking
to get nook you dont wanna think
of women as people You just wanna
think of them as Yeses and Noes

TRENT
As in Yes I will have sex with you
or No I wont have sex with you

RUSSELL
As long as you meet a womans MFS
Minimum Fuckability Standard you
have the possibility of sleeping with
her Within three minutes after meeting
you a womans determined if you meet
her MFS Single women married women
grandmothers They size you up in the
first three minutes

TRENT
I would say objectively you meet
the minimum fuckability standard of
seventy percent of the women in this
city

STAN
Seventy percent

NEAL
How do you figure out that number

TRENT
Its a judgment call There are a
lot of factors No one hits a hundred
percent on the MFS scale and very
few guys are absolute zeroes We all
fall somewhere in between

RUSSELL
The point is if you meet a womans
MFS you have a chance with her

NEAL
Minimum Fuckability Standard Ive
never thought about it but every
woman has to have one
STAN
So when I walk into a room any room
roughly seventy percent of the women
there would fuck me

TRENT
Yes And thirty percent would never
dream of fucking you

STAN
Seventy percent sounds awfully high

RUSSELL
Hes not saying they wanna fuck you
at first sight Hes saying under
the right circumstances they would
fuck you

TRENT
You may not be a womans first choice
You may not be her tenth choice But
as long as youre above her minimum
you could be the guy she goes home
with tonight

RUSSELL
The trick is youre not searching
for the woman who thinks youre
irresistible That woman is hard to
find Youre searching for the woman
who thinks youre handsome enough
smart enough witty enough that she
wont be disgusted with herself if
she fucks you

TRENT
While alcohol can affect a womans
MFS in your favor alcohol is a
variable Maybe she gets horny when
she gets drunk but maybe she becomes
an angry man hater We just want
pussy We dont have time for drama
When youre looking for a one night
stand drunk girls are the last refuge
of the amateur Professionals are
all about the MFS Judge if you meet
a girls MFS and then make a move
only if youve got a shot

NEAL
This is fascinating Id like to put
this to the test

RUSSELL
Were going to Stan can have sex
without even leaving this apartment
complex

This sounds appealing to Stan

STAN
I can

RUSSELL
Danika in 1680

NEAL
Whos Danika in 1680

EXT APARTMENT COMPLEX POOL - NIGHT

Its an ordinary Friday night at Stans apartment pool Lots
of TWENTY-SOMETHINGS in bathing suits Hot tubbing Water
volleyball Flirting

DANIKA is an overly cheerful hair-stylist She walks out of
the pool and towels off Stan and the guys watch her

RUSSELL
Danika lives in the building It was
the forth of July barbecue when she
tried to seduce Stan

STAN
She didnt try to seduce me It was
a sexual assault

RUSSELL
She had just found out her husband
was leaving her and she went a little
crazy

STAN
She cornered me on the shuffleboard
courts and tried to suck my dick
through my bathing suit

RUSSELL
He screamed for help

STAN
I didnt scream I asked for help
And nobody came

NEAL
The point is you clearly meet her
minimum fuckability standard

STAN
Everyone does Since her husband
left shes pretty much done it with
every unattached guy that lives here

RUSSELL
Which reminds me Ive gotta tell
her that Marie and I broke up
TRENT
Not tonight Tonight shes Stans

Stan thinks about it

STAN
She is kinda hot

NEAL
Youve got one night to make up for
a lifetime of underestimating your
ability to score

STAN
I dont know Sometimes Julie and I
ride up with her in the elevator
Its already awkward with Julie
knowing that she tried to rape me

The guys all stare him down

STAN (CONTD)
(relenting)
Alright Youre right Ill go

He approaches Danika

STAN (CONTD)
Hey Danika

DANIKA
(bubbly)
Hi Stan How are you Wheres Julie
Is she still mad at me

STAN
Julie gave me the night off So Im
unattached tonight Free to do
whatever I want

DANIKA
Really So youre relationship is
open now

STAN
Not Just for this one night
DANIKA
Thats kinda weird
STAN
I know
DANIKA

Samantha or Sam as in Samuel

DANIKA

Stan grimaces

STAN
Ill be right back

He rushes over to the guys
STAN (CONTD)

Danikas just asked me to join a
three-way

RUSSELL
Look at you That was fast
NEAL
Im living vicariously through you
TRENT
Will it be a sword fight or a clam
bake
STAN

If I understand your code words
correctly it will not be a clam bake
The other participant is a man

TRENT
Sword fight Thats a tough call

RUSSELL
Danika is hot but then again you
will have at the very least
incidental contact with another mans
genitals

STAN
Yeah thats my concern I kinda
feel like Ive already touched enough
strange dick for one night Would
you guys do this

RUSSELL
Absolutely

TRENT
Without a doubt

NEAL
Id like to think I would

Stan psyches himself up

STAN
Okay Okay Okay Im gonna do it

EXT THE WET SPOT - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

WAITRESS delivers their drinks Karen is beside herself but
trying to bite her tongue

BETH
Dont let him do this Youre

gonna be enough to get him over
himself

JULIE
I believe it can

MARIE
Hes never gonna catch up to your
number in one night

JULIE
Its not about that He just needs a
chance to go wild

Karen finally explodes

KAREN
He had that chance before he met you
He blew it Thats not your fault
You shouldnt have to be punished
This whole thing makes me sick

BETH

Do guys have a magic number in their
head Like a number that would just
be enough You know Whats enough -
I dont usually use this word but
in this case its the only word that
really captures it - whats enough
pussy

MARIE
Its different for every guy but
four definitely isnt enough

KAREN

(really riled up)
Wrong The answer is ‘its never
enough Thats why we dont do what
she did We dont give them a pass
Thats against the rules Your va-
jay is the last va-jay Thats it
Theres no wiggle room Because if
they think theres wiggle room the
whole fucking system collapses

JULIE
Listen I think I made the right
choice But I dont wanna dwell on
it I wanna forget about it and have
a good time Now who wants to dance

Julie downs her mojito and heads for the dance floor

KAREN
I swear to Christ if Neal comes
home tonight asking me if he can
sleep with another woman Im gonna
kill him and make it look like she
did it

INT DANIKAS SHOWER - MINUTES LATER

Danika rinses herself under the water Stan is plastered
against the back wall keeping his distance

DANIKA
Are you okay Stan

STAN
I feel a little awkward about having
sex with someone other than Julie

DANIKA
(re Stans penis)
He doesnt look like he feels awkward
about it

STAN
No He seems to be downright
delighted I wish I could share his
enthusiasm

DANIKA
Lets see if I can convince you

She drops down to her knees That instant the DOORBELL rings

TRENT
You know were we should go This
bookstore downtown Tome Sweet Tome

the couch open into a bed

STAN

BERNADETTE
Try to keep your voice down so you

She motions with her head and Stan notices a FIVE-YEAR-OLD
BOY and a THREE-YEAR-OLD BOY sleeping on the floor in the
corner

Bernadette starts to undress Stan She takes off his shirt
STAN

You leave your kids home alone while

looks over at the sleeping kids And then back at her She
reaches down the front of his underwear

BERNADETTE (CONTD)

While she kisses his neck Stan looks back over at the
sleeping kids She puts his hands on her breasts He looks
back at her

BERNADETTE (CONTD)

She helps him squeeze his hands

BERNADETTE (CONTD)
Oh yeah Harder I can actually cum
from this

Stan looks back at the kids and this time theyre awake The
three-year-old ogles Stan and Bernadette with his mouth
hanging open He slaps his hand over his open mouth in shock

The five-year-old watches Stan with an intense angry ‘I cant
believe youre trying to fuck my mommy gaze

STAN
Theyre up The kids are up

BERNADETTE
Go back to sleep goddammit boys

The younger one scrunches his eyes closed and pretends to
sleep The older one maintains his steely glare

Bernadette grabs Stans face and turns him back towards her
She gives him a deep wet kiss Stan struggles

He finally breaks free from the kiss and looks back over
The older boy is gone

Suddenly Stan hears a GUTTURAL SCREAM coming from the other
direction and snaps his head around to find

The older boy charging out of the kitchen area towards Stan
with a BUTCHER KNIFE clenched in his raised fist

Stan bucks Bernadette off and rolls out of the way as the
knife pierces the pillow next to his head

STAN
Holy fuck

The older boy lunges at Stan again

BERNADETTE
Goddammit Billy Put that knife
down What did I tell you about tryin
to kill mommys friends

Stan scrambles around as he avoids the crazed boy slashing

at him with the knife Finally Stans able to grab the kid

and disarm him He then pushes the kid away a little harder
than a grown man should push a five-year old Billy bounces

off the wall and immediately starts CRYING

EXT BERNADETTES TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER

Stan rushes out of the trailer dressed with his shoes in
his hand Bernadette follows him out

BERNADETTE
I was gonna rock your world you
little bitch

She slams the door The Rednecks are watching him Stan goes
to get in his car

SKINNY REDNECK
I wouldnt do that if I was you

FAT REDNECK
We booby-trapped your car Shes gonna
blow if you try and turn the ignition

He points under the car Stan bends down and looks Sure
enough theres a homemade bomb strapped to the undercarriage
Stan quickly backs away

SKINNY REDNECK
Bernadettes gonna be mine some day
Id thank you to stay away from her

STAN
I will gladly stay away from her
just for you Would you please take
the bomb off my car

SKINNY REDNECK
No I will not

STAN
Seriously

SKINNY REDNECK
You look like an educated Jew to me
Thems two things I dont like much

The Silent Redneck once again mimes killing Stan with an
invisible shotgun

Stan offers them a big fake smile and then turns his back
and dials Russell on his cell phone

STAN
(under his breath)
Help

EXT THE WET SPOT - NIGHT

A long line of CLUBBERS wait to get in Julie sits on the
curb by herself deep in thought Marie and Beth join her

MARIE
Karens inside berating Neal Are
you still sure youre okay with this
whole thing

JULIE
Yes I want Stan to marry me without
any regrets

BETH
Did Stan ask you if you were entering
into the marriage with any regrets

JULIE
(hesitates)
Im not Absolutely not No regrets

Marie is not sure she believes her friend

BETH
Dont you think youre gonna regret
letting him do this

JULIE
I dont think I will I think I made
the right choice

MARIE
Most relationships fail No one has
come up with the foolproof answer
for how to make one work So maybe
what youre doing is exactly the
right thing

JULIE
Lets get out of here I feel like
going to the beach

INT TAXI CAB - NIGHT

Still frazzled Stan rides up front with the TAXI DRIVER
Russell Neal and Trent are in the back

TAXI DRIVER

(thick Jersey accent)
I know this guy Joey I probably
shouldnt say his last name This
guy Joey Mendelssohn He and his
friends used to play a game called
Hogging What this game is is you
go out to a bar or a club ora
party whatever You find the ugliest
most disgusting bitch you can find
Im talkin about the fattest
nastiest hairiest most lopsided
hunchbacked bitch you can find
Shes gotta be so ugly you can barely
look directly at her Alright now
you buy her a few drinks and sweet
talk her You gotta really make her
feel special Then you take her home
and you give her the fucking of a
lifetime You pound the shit outta
her You fuck her in the mouth You
fuck her in the ass If you can find
a girl whos missing an eye - Bam -
you fuck her in the eye hole Then
as soon as you get off the minute
you cum you start yellin at her

(yelling)
Get the fuck away from me you ugly
whore Get away Get away You make
me sick Get the fuck away Im gonna
fuckin vomit

(calmly)
You just keep doin that until she
leaves Then you meet up with your
buddies and debate about who fucked
the filthiest hog

(beat)
I dont know I never done it Sounds
like it could be fun

Stan stares at him blankly He looks back at his friends who
all shrug The cab screeches to a halt

TAXI DRIVER (CONTD)
Here we are Tome Sweet Tome Good
luck on your quest my friend

EXT TOME SWEET TOME BOOKSTORE - THAT MOMENT

Stan climbs out of the cab A sign on the window reads
SINGLES NIGHT - Fridays 8pm-2am - Wine and Hors doeuvres
As Russell Neal and Trent get out Stan stops them

STAN
Listen guys I really appreciate
all your help but I think Im gonna
go it alone from here

RUSSELL
Is this because of your car It didnt
make sense to confront those rednecks

NEAL
We called Homeland Security Im
sure theyll do something

STAN
Its not about the car Youve been
great I just think this is the kind
of thing a grown man needs to do by
himself

The guys understand

TRENT
Im telling you the bookstore is
the answer You probably meet the
MFS of every girl in there

NEAL
Get going Its nearly one am

RUSSELL
Promise us you wont give up

STAN
I wont give up Im determined to

sleep with at least two complete
strangers before sunrise

As Stan walks away

RUSSELL
Make it five Five complete strangers

Stan waves and walks inside the bookstore

INT TOME SWEET TOME - NIGHT

The singles scene for the socially awkward Dozens of male
and female MISFITS ranging from oddly attractive to flat-out
scary looking

At the WELCOME TABLE Stan fills out his name tag It reads
Hello my name is Stan and my favorite book is Catcher in
the Rye He sticks the name tag on his shirt

As he turns away from the table he bumps into ANNIE She
looks like a hotter version of Velma from Scooby Doo

STAN
Excuse me
(reads her name tag)
Annie

ANNIE
My fault Stan I wasnt watching
where I was going

They smile at each other Stan looks to her name tag for a
conversation starter Her favorite book is

STAN
Red Badge of Courage I havent read
that since middle school

ANNIE
Im a member of
(quotes with her fingers)
The book club

Stan nods He doesnt know what that means

STAN
Me too
ANNIE
(dubious )
You are
STAN

Yeah Recent Joined recently

ANNIE
I thought you might be because I
saw that Catcher in the Rye is your
favorite book But you didnt
immediately strike me as someone
whod be a fan of Catcher You should
go talk to Wendy Shes into guys
who like Catcher

Annie motions toward WENDY Shes five feet tall and roughly
two hundred and fifty pounds Not Stans type

STAN
Maybe Ill do that later Talk to
Wendy Right now I was kinda hoping
to buy you a coffee if youre
interested Or a Danish Tea Scone

ANNIE
Oh well you seem like a nice guy
but Im sort of looking for a fan of
Red Badge

STAN
I love Red Badge

ANNIE
Really I was about to give up hope
that anyone here tonight likes it

STAN
I do

ANNIE
Ive never met a guy whos into Red
Badge and into Catcher

This girl is odd

STAN
I also like The Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn

ANNIE
(confused)
Thats not a book club book

STAN
(recovers fast)
No I know
(changing the subject)
Can I buy you that coffee

ANNIE
Definitely You know I only come to
these Singles things once a month
and its so disappointing if I dont
find anyone who likes Red Badge

STAN
Luckily we bumped into each other

ANNIE
Yeah After coffee maybe we can go
back to my place

She heads for the coffee bar Stan hesitates He makes eye
contact with a NERDY GUY

STAN
I never knew it could be this easy
to pick up women

NERDY GUY
(really hostile)
Fuck you dude Ive been trying to
get a woman to talk to me all night

EXT SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT
Stan holds onto Annie as he rides on the back of her Vespa

ANNIE
Alright please dont think Im
weird

STAN
(worried)
What Why

ANNIE
I teach third grade You know they
dont pay teachers very well I got
in a little credit card trouble
so Im living with my parents

She pulls into the driveway of a nice middle class house
They climb off the Vespa

STAN
(relieved)
Thats not that weird

ANNIE
Oh good I was worried you were gonna
think I was some kinda strange-o

INT ANNIES HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Annie leads Stan in by his hand They pass her PARENTS who
sit silently reading in barcaloungers

ANNIE
Mom Dad this is Stan Were gonna
be in my bedroom Hes into Red Badge

INT ANNIES BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER

Stan looks at all the handmade birthday cards (from her third
grade students) that Annie has tacked up on the wall Then

he checks his watch Shes talking incessantly

Annies behind the partially open bathroom door Although
shes barely visible it seems that shes changing clothes

ANNIE (0S)

but I decided that wasnt for me
Anyway I love teaching third grade
because I feel like Im working with
the kids at an age when I can still
have a positive affect on them They
havent been completely ruined yet

She steps out of the bathroom in a long Hello Kitty nightgown

ANNIE (CONTD)
Just FYI Im not wearing anything
under this

Stan smiles

STAN
Did you wanna talk about Red Badge
of Courage

ANNIE
Theres no reason to talk about it
I love it You love it Thats all
that matters

Annie takes out a joint she had hidden in the pages of a
book and lights up

ANNIE (CONTD)
Do you smoke pot

STAN
Ive been known to

She passes him the joint He takes a hit

ANNIE
Do you do heroin

Caught off-guard he coughs up a lung full of smoke

STAN
No Do you

ANNIE
Me No My ex did Thats how I got
in credit card trouble My ex had a
heroin dealer who took American
Express

STAN
I didnt even know that was possible

ANNIE
All these exorbitant charges for
guitar lessons Turns out it was
really heroin

She puts the joint down and lies on the bed

ANNIE (CONTD)
Are you gonna make a move

Stan quickly takes off his shoes He gets in bed on top of
her so theyre face to face He awkwardly kisses her

She smiles and then pushes down on his shoulders not very
subtly trying to get him to go down on her She stops pushing
when hes about halfway there and he kisses her belly through
her nightgown

He looks up at her and she smiles again Then she starts
pushing on his head to get him the rest of the way down He
resists a little

ANNIE (CONTD)
Whats wrong

STAN
Nothing

ANNIE
Why arent you doing it Is it because
youd rather be with a woman whos
into Catcher in the Rye

STAN
No Im glad to be with a woman whos
into Red Badge

ANNIE
Well then stop playing around and
kiss me down there

She pushes on his head again He scoots down between her
legs He kisses her inner thighs She grabs his head and
forces it under her nightgown

SQUISH

STAN
Ahhh What the fuck

He pulls out and the lower half of his face is covered with
MENSTRUAL BLOOD He reels around disturbed and nauseated

STAN (CONTD)
Youre menstruating

ANNIE
Of course

STAN
Dont you think thats something you
should have mentioned

He grabs her pillow and wipes his face

ANNIE
(distressed)
Youre not really a member of the
book club are you

STAN
What the fuck does that have to do
with anything

Stan runs into
ANNIES BATHROOM

He picks up her soap dispenser and pumps a bunch of liquid
soap into his mouth Annie follows him in He washes his
face and tongue

ANNIE
If you were really in the book club
you wouldve known what it meant
that Red Badge is my favorite book

STAN
I just thought it meant you like
classic American literature

ANNIE
I dont really like that book Its
code for what Im into sexually If
a woman says her favorite book is
Red Badge of Courage it means she
likes men to perform cunnilingus
when shes on her period

STAN
What

ANNIE
You said your favorite is Catcher in
the Rye If youre in the book club
being a fan of Catcher means you
like it when a woman wears a strap-
on and fs you in ake

STAN
What Its a good thing I didnt go
home with Wendy

ANNIE
Moby Dick Of Human Bondage The Cat
in the Hat It doesnt take a genius
to figure out what the titles are
code for I could get kicked out of
the book club for this you know
The first rule of book club is you
dont talk about book club

STAN
(beat perplexed)
Cat in the Hat

ANNIE
I think you should leave

EXT ANNIES HOUSE - NIGHT

Stan exits the house dialing his cell when he notices the
taxi parked across the street

Russell Neal and Trent are in the taxi with the same Taxi
Driver that dropped Stan off

STAN
Did you guys follow me
RUSSELL
Hell yes
NEAL

Weve got nothing better to do

TRENT
You bang ‘er

STAN
(shakes his head)

earning your red badge of courage

TAXI DRIVER
Doesnt everybody know that

EXT BEACH - NIGHT

A hundred or so REVELERS carouse near a huge BEACH BONFIRE
Not too far away Julie Karen and Beth stand at the edge of
the water holding their shoes

KAREN
Men dont have meaningless sex Its
very meaningful to them It just
doesnt mean any of the things we
would like it to mean

JULIE
Lets say Marie hooks up with that
surfer shes flirting with right now

The ladies look over at Marie whos chatting with a BLONDE
SURFER and his SURFER FRIENDS

JULIE (CONTD)
What will the sex mean to him
and what will it mean to her

KAREN
Theres only three ways for men to
measure success Money power and
how many women theyve nailed

JULIE
Thats not true Entirely

KAREN
That guys got no money no power
so Marie is nothing but a way for
him to feel good about himself

JULIE
Im pretty sure thats all he is to
her as well

KAREN
Its different Women love feeling
wanted and desired Men love feeling
like theyve won He wants to
conqueror her

BETH
So what As long as everybodys

JULIE
Were not better than them Theyre
not better than us Were all
pathetic Just in different ways

KAREN
Fuck that Women are better

INT TAXI CAB - NIGHT

Cruising down AlA Once again Stans up front with the
Driver The rest of the guys are in the back

STAN
I already told you no hookers

RUSSELL
Its not like shes a street walker
Shes a call girl Theres a huge
difference

Russell holds his iphone up to show Stan a picture of a
beautiful nineteen year old Shes classy but still whorish

STAN
Youve got call girls on your iphone

TRENT
We found her online Thats where
everybody gets their whores now
NEAL
Shes hot right Nineteen From
Slovakia

STAN
That pictures not real Thats just
to suck you in Shes not gonna look
like that Shes gonna look like my
Aunt Ethel

RUSSELL
No she wont

STAN

(to Taxi Driver)
My Aunt Ethel had a tumor on her
face that resembled David Letterman
and she wouldnt have it removed
because she was trying to get booked
on his show

(beat)
She died She died and my cousin
kept the tumor In fact I think
hes still trying to get the tumor
on Letterman

RUSSELL
We already arranged it Her name is
Chastity

STAN
Chastity What kind of name is that
for a hooker

NEAL
Im sure its not her real name
Its her work name Maybe shes got
an ironic sense of humor

STAN
Right because there are a lot of hot

nineteen year old Slovakian prostitutes

with a good grasp of irony

TRENT
Youve only got a little over four
hours left and you havent had any
luck so far tonight This ones
guaranteed to work out because its
paid for Shes not gonna have a
dick She wont be bleeding There
arent gonna be any other guys there

NEAL
Or kids Who try to kill you

RUSSELL
Its just you and a high priced call
girl catering to your every whim
and desire

STAN
How much is this gonna cost me
TRENT
Dont worry Were paying
RUSSELL
Its all set up I already emailed
her pimp
STAN

You emailed her pimp

NEAL
Shes supposed to meet you in room
two-twelve of the Coral Sky Motel in
ten minutes Well watch and wait

STAN (OS)
Just out of curiosity whats a pimps

RUSSELL (0S)
Sweet pimpin at yahoo dot com

NEAL (0S)
Actually it was sweet dot pimpin’ at
yahoo dot com

EXT MOTEL - NIGHT

The guys sit in the cab and watch room 212 An obvious pimp-
mobile pulls up and CHASTITY climbs out Shes every bit as
impressive as her picture

NEAL
See that Just like her picture

She climbs the stairs and enters room 212 The pimp-mobile
drives away

STAN
You wanna know how this could go
wrong This could turn out to be a
sting and I could end up in jail

RUSSELL
As soon as you get in the room tell
her to show you her tits If shes a
cop she cant do that

TRENT
Thats not true What it is is she
cant touch your dick So as soon as
you get in there pull out your dick
and tell her to play with it

NEAL
No I think you have to have her
pull it out If you pull it out youve
already committed a sex crime

TAXI DRIVER
What you might wanna do - Im not
saying I would do this - you might
wanna give her a little punch in the
face Just walk right in there and
pop her one If shes a whore shes
gonna take the punch If shes a cop
youll have some trouble but at
least you wont have a record for
solicitation

STAN
Well the taxi driver might be insane
but at least hes thought this through

Stan gets out Neal hands him some cash

NEAL
Five hundred is what her pimp said
you owe for the basic package Plus
Im throwing in an extra couple of
hundred in case you want anything
off the special menu

TRENT
I highly recommend analingus if its
available

Stan takes the money He gives a hundred to the taxi driver
STAN
They dont have to go home but they
cant stay here

The cab begins to pull away

RUSSELL
Good luck

NEAL
Its two thirty-seven in the morning

NEAL (CONTD)
If you spend an hour with her you
still have plenty of time to find
more girls

INT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Chastity opens the door to find Stan She has a Slavic accent

CHASTITY
You are Stan yes

STAN
I am Stan yes How do I know that
youre not a cop

CHASTITY
(confused)
I am going to have sex on you
American police do not do this

She goes and sits on the bed Stan enters and closes the
door She stares at him Hes unsure how to proceed

STAN
Chastity is an odd name for a woman
in your profession

CHASTITY
It is not my real name My pimp
Sweet Sweet give me this name
Drahuska is real name It does not
have a ring to it Stan is easy name
to say Drahuska not easy for American
mouth People make fun

STAN
My last name is Kooperberg So I
know about people making fun When I
was in elementary school all the
kids called me Stanley Cuckoo-bird

CHASTITY
Ha This is funny

STAN
Im glad my childhood torment amuses
you

CHASTITY
You would like for us to clothes off
and get sexy now

STAN
I guess Whenever youre ready

Chastity looks a little queasy

CHASTITY
Excuse me please

She runs into the bathroom Stan watches her bend over the
toilet and vomit without lifting the lid Puke splashes
onto the lid and cascades onto the floor

CHASTITY (CONTD)
I forgot to lift the top

STAN
Are you okay

CHASTITY
Yes This is my first time making
sex with strange man for money So I
am a little nervous I try to hide
my nerves from you but then I vomit

STAN
Youre saying youve never prostituted
yourself before

CHASTITY
Yes You are my first how they say
truck No Trick

STAN
Well we dont have to do this if you
dont want to

CHASTITY
Yes Sweet Sweet and his lady friend
buy me on the internet They give my
family in Slovak Republic a lot of
money And now I must work for them
They have two business Prostitution
and house cleaning service If I
work prostitution I am free in one
year House cleaning ten years

STAN
Jesus Thats incredibly illegal
They cant buy you And they cant
force you to have sex for money

CHASTITY
They do not force me I can also clean
houses But that is terrible job

STAN
So youd rather sell your body

CHASTITY
I would rather to be dental hygienist
or Entertainment Tonight co-host I
think But you cant always get what
you want

STAN
But if the thought of having sex
with me makes you vomit

CHASTITY
No You do not make me vomit I expect
much much ugly hairy man to pay for
making intercourse I am happy to
see you You are not so ugly

STAN
At least I meet your MFS That
probably doesnt happen a lot for
hookers

CHASTITY
I do not know this MFS Please Let
me give you pleasure you will pay
for

STAN
Are you sure

CHASTITY
I am sure Please Undress me now

Chastity stands ready with a big smile on her face as Stan
hesitant and awkward removes her dress Then her shoes Her
stockings and garter belt He goes around back to open her
bra Then comes back around front when he realizes the catch
is in the front He removes her bra

CHASTITY (CONTD)
Nice bosom yes

STAN
Very nice bosom

She covers her mouth and then vomits all over herself

CHASTITY
That one came so fast I did not even
have time to run to the bathroom

STAN
I really think you should reconsider
this as a career Lots of people
hate their job but if you hate it
to the point that it makes you puke
on yourself you should probably do
something else

Chastity sighs She thinks for a long moment
CHASTITY

Perhaps you are right
(MORE )
She speed

She holds

CHASTITY (CONTD)
I will call Sweet Sweet and tell him
maybe I am better cleaning lady than
call girl One of his other hoes
will come and take care of business
for you

dials Sweet Sweet on her cell
STAN

Thats okay I dont need another
ho Im all set

up a finger signaling Stan to wait She walks to
the far corner as she talks on the phone

CHASTITY
Sweet Sweet it is Drahuska I have
decided I cannot sell my body Please

Indecipherable RANTING and RAVING emanates from her phone

She hangs

up

CHASTITY (CONTD)

upset He is coming here now

STAN

to put the chain on the motel door but hes too shaky Sweet
Sweet forces the door open

diamond incrusted GOLD GRILL His tiny spitfire of a
girlfriend YOLANDA is with him

YOLANDA

Yolanda shocks him again Longer this time OUCH

STAN (CONTD)

EXT MOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

Stan and Chastity are pushed out of the motel room COMPLETELY
NAKED Sweet Sweet slams the door trapping them outside on
the second floor walkway

STAN
Fantastic This has really been a
wonderful night so far How am I
going to explain to my fiancée that
I gave our PIN number to a pimp so
he could empty our bank account

CHASTITY
My friend Zora is sexing with truck -
trick in room one oh seven We get
clothes from her

Stan and Chastity sneak along the walkway toward the stairs
They freeze as a TOUGH BIKER with an ice bucket exits his
room The Biker turns the other way without noticing them
They follow behind him until they reach the stairs

On the first floor Stan and Chastity scurry past the MOTEL
OFFICE where the CLERK reads a comic book The Clerk looks
up briefly thinking he saw something but Stan and Chastity
are out of view

They arrive at room 107 The lights are on Chastity knocks

CHASTITY (CONTD)
(whispers)
Zora is Drahuska

The door swings open revealing a FAT MAN in his boxers His
FAT WIFE in a muu muu is a few feet behind him The Fat
Man looks them over

FAT MAN
Fuckin perverts
CHASTITY
(confused)

Perhaps Zora in room one oh six
The Fat Man grabs hold of Stan and Chastity

FAT MAN
Citizens arrest

STAN
Were not perverts I have a
reasonably good explanation

FAT MAN
Sinners and perverts thats all
they got in this goddamn state

Chastity bites the Fat Mans arm He HOWLS and lets go of
her She takes off like a shot running NAKED into the
distance

CHASTITY
Good bye Stan Thank you

Stan tries to break free but only manages to drag the Fat
Man with him

FAT MAN
Betsy grab the bible and call the
police

Stan gets loose for a moment but the Fat Man is faster than
he looks He tackles Stan on the lawn His face in the grass
Stan lies naked beneath the Fat Man in his boxers

FAT MAN (CONTD)

regrets - that isnt entirely true

MARIE
I knew there had to be something

JULIE
My college boyfriend Devlin

KAREN
The one who became a famous artist

JULIE
The only guy other than Stan that
I was really truly in love with

KAREN
Alright spill

JULIE

(sighs)
About six months into our
relationship I finally got up the
nerve to say ‘I love you There
was a long pause He stared into my
eyes and he responded You know I
think youre amazing

cringe

BETH
A nice compliment But not quite
good enough at that moment

JULIE
Right But I let it go I didnt
question him And for another six
months I never said I love you
again I waited for him to say it
(MORE )

it
JULIE (CONTD)
On our one year anniversary we had
an amazing night together and we
were lying in bed falling asleep in
each others arms in what felt like
a moment of perfect intimacy And
he still didnt say it So I watched
him sleep for a little while then I
got up painted the words ‘Its over
on one of his canvases and left
And I never spoke to him again He
didnt try to contact me I left New
York at the end of that semester
moved back to Florida and finished
school here

BETH
Wow Thats a weird way to break up

JULIE
I ran away to see if hed chase after
me I was so in love with him and I
thought maybe he loved me but he
couldnt say it So I gave hima
chance to prove it

KAREN
(sympathizing)
Which he didnt

JULIE
And its tortured me because I dont
know if he gave up because he didnt
really love me or because he thought
I fell out of love with him I
regret I really really regret
that I wasnt mature enough to talk
to him about it The way it ended
wasnt right

KAREN
You tested Devlin by running away to
see if hed chase after you and now
youre testing Stan by pushing him
away to see if hell come back

Julie considers Karens words

JULIE
I wasnt intentionally trying to
test anyone I was trying to help

them figure things out for themselves

I love Stan I dont wanna be with
Devlin I just wanna know if I fucked
up something that could have worked

MARIE
(torn)
Ive thought about mentioning this
to you before but I didnt know if
it was a good idea - Devlin has a
loft on South Beach When hes not
in New York hes here

JULIE
I know

KAREN
You know

JULIE

I was curious about him Not in an
obsessive stalkerish kind of way
but not everyone once dated a famous
artist so I follow him on Twitter
But he doesnt know its me I use a
fake name How do you know

MARIE
Twitter Just because youve talked
about him I was curious too

KAREN
You should contact him

MARIE
He is in South Beach for the winter

BETH
If tonight is Stans night for
eliminating regrets before you get
married shouldnt it be your night
too Dont you think you should go
see Devlin

KAREN
Of course she thinks she should
Shes trying to get us to tell her
she should

JULIE
No Im not Its about to be four
oclock in the morning I would have
brought it up earlier if thats what
I wanted to do

KAREN
Youre afraid because you still
have feelings for him

JULIE
(97 sure)
No I dont At least not the kind of
feelings youre implying

KAREN
Then go see him Beths right
Tonights the night

JULIE
Even if it made sense to show up at
his door at this hour I would never
do that without telling Stan first

BETH
So tell him

Julie winces just thinking about it

That sends Shontelle over the edge She takes aim

SHONTELLE
Thats it Thats it

Stan watches her finger tense on the trigger He shoulder
checks her as she fires and the shot misses Marcus hitting
a bedside lamp Stan and Shontelle end up on the floor

Marcus fires a few shots intended to scare Shontelle while
shes down

STAN
Oh Christ I dont like guns I
especially dont like bullets

As she tries to get up Stan is only interested in getting
the handcuff key out of her pocket The dog rushes into the
room barking Shontelle points at Page

SHONTELLE
Fuck her up

The dog and Page lock eyes He lunges but before he can get
to her Page hits the floor and crawls under the bed

On Marcuss side of the bed the dog sticks his head under

On her knees Shontelle takes another shot at Marcus Stan
gets her key ring out of her pocket and fumbles as he tries
to open the cuffs He frees one wrist

MARCUS

STAN
Thats probably true

PAGE
Honest thats not really my theory

not crazy or anything My parents
make me go to a psychiatrist because
I made a cell phone video of me

sent to this guy I liked and he put
it on youtube Thats how I met

dad when he tried to run over the
guy who put the video online

STAN
How does your dad feel about you having

what the hell shes doing here

Its a giant open loft Part living space part artists
studio Theres finished and unfinished artwork everywhere
Drawings Paintings Wood and Metal sculptures All visually
interesting The guy is good

The kitchen is an island in the middle of the room Julie
sits at the counter while Devlin gets her a glass of water

JULIE (CONTD)
Thanks for letting me in I would
understand if you were still angry
with me

DEVLIN
I was never angry Sad for a while
But that passed You look great

Julie sips her water As she does she notices two huge
paintings of herself on the wall She nearly chokes One is
a portrait In the other shes completely nude holding her
arms out as if shes offering a hug Shes smiling in both

Between the two paintings hangs the canvas with the words
Its over

JULIE
I dont recall posing for those

DEVLIN
You didnt I painted them from memory

DEVLIN (CONTD)
And the way I wanted to remember
you I never thought you were the
bad guy I thought I was

STAN
Listen Yvette I dont have a lot
of time to be coy so Im just gonna
be completely straight forward and
hope I dont offend you

YVETTE
You know Im not easily offended

STAN
Its been a long night and things
havent gone my way possibly until
right now Bumping into you here
might be fate The question is - the
way you flirt with me at work - is
that just for your amusement or if
faced with the opportunity to take
that flirtation to the next level
would you be interested

YVETTE
Did you call off your engagement

STAN
No Im asking if youd like to have
a one night stand Because I have a
pass until sunrise and I havent
been able to use it yet

YVETTE
Stan Im not that kind of girl Im
looking for something deep and
meaningful

STAN
I totally understand Im sorry I
asked Ill see you at work on Monday

Wait Stan Im looking for something
deep and meaningful but in the
meantime I still need to get laid

INT DEVLINS LOFT - NIGHT

Julie walks around admiring some of Devlins sculptures as
they talk

JULIE
--- So I sent him off to have sex
with other women And Im really
hoping that will solve his problem
without creating any new ones

Devlin has no idea what to say He kind of shrugs

JULIE (CONTD)
Which leads me to why Im here The
marriage will officially end the
me part of my life Im committing
myself to being part of an us from
that day on If theres one thing I
learned from the way I left you you
cant truly have a new beginning if
you have regrets or you leave things
unresolved

DEVLIN
If youre here to tell me why you
left Im pretty sure I know And I
completely understand
He stares

She knows

She does

JULIE
Did you not love me or were you just
unable to say it

DEVLIN
Neither I loved you very much I
could have told you I wanted to
tell you But I chose not to It was
the biggest mistake Ive ever made

at her making her uncomfortable

JULIE
Thats good to know I should be
going

DEVLIN
You should stay and have a glass of
wine

she shouldnt

DEVLIN (CONTD)
Dont you want me to explain why I
never said it

EXT LIFEGUARD STATION - NIGHT

Several hundred feet from the BONFIRE and the people Stan
follows Yvette They approach an art Deco Lifeguard Station

STAN
I feel bad about you leaving your
date back there

YVETTE
Dont He was nothing like his
matchcom profile and he smelled
like beef jerky And I was most likely
gonna let him violate me anyway

STAN
So its lucky for you I came along
Where are we going

She climbs the stairs to the locked door on the station

STAN (CONTD)
Can we go in there

YVETTE
Do you know how to pick a lock

STAN
No

the floor And they begin making out

YVETTE
Im gonna make you forget all about
Julie

INT DEVLINS LOFT - NIGHT

Julie watches Devlin as he chooses a bottle of red wine
opens it and pours two glasses

DEVLIN
My father was an incredibly talented
artist Much more talented than I
am He sat me down when I was leaving
for college and told me - as much as
he loved his family and he wouldnt
change what he had he didnt get
the life he imagined for himself
because he wasnt able to focus on
his passion He made the choice to
be a good father and a good husband
rather than follow his dream He
didnt come out and call it a mistake
but he was telling me not to make
the same mistake he did

He approaches and hands her the glass of wine He remains
close to her

JULIE
You believe that if we had stayed
together you wouldnt have become a
successful artist

DEVLIN
Ill never know
(MORE )

DEVLIN (CONTD)
But I believed at twenty that if I
told you I loved you I was choosing
you over my art

JULIE
Have you ever told any woman you
loved her

DEVLIN
Youre the only one Ive ever loved
Silence He kisses her She pulls away almost immediately
JULIE
Christ Devlin What are you doing

Fuck That was really inappropriate

DEVLIN
Im sorry Im sorry I should
probably tell you that Im on ecstasy

done that

He follows her toward the door

DEVLIN
Please dont I need to paint you
Im feeling tremendously inspired

Julie tears up

JULIE
Im having an emotional night with
Stan out doing who knows what or

She continues for the door He stops her

DEVLIN
Please Julie help me out I havent

fingerpainting Please stay and let
me paint you What else are you gonna
do until sunrise

She sighs He has a point
EXT LIFEGUARD STATION OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT

Stan sits in the wooden lifeguard chair on the observation
deck with Yvette straddling him High above the beach with
the moon shimmering on the water and the bonfire in the
distance they continue to make-out and grope each other
Stans a bit uneasy but hes not stopping

YVETTE
Remember the Christmas party two
years ago I know this is gonna sound
crazy but I stood under the mistletoe
for five full minutes waiting for
you to notice and kiss me

STAN
Didnt Russell end up kissing you

Yvette stands up and removes her shorts and T-shirt revealing
a skimpy bikini

YVETTE
Yes And by New Years Eve you were
dating Julie

She pulls off Stans track pants practically yanking him
off the chair Then she removes her bikini top and hops back
on his lap They kiss some more

YVETTE (CONTD)
Let me show you what I would do for
you every night if you were my fiancé

She goes down on him Stans eyes go wide He concentrates
on breathing Yvette removes a condom from her purse and

straddles

He gently

She grabs

him once again

YVETTE (CONTD)
Look into my eyes I want you to see
the look of pleasure on my face as
you penetrate me Youre gonna forget
all about Julie

STAN
Stop I cant do it

YVETTE
You dont have to do anything Ill
do all the work

STAN
No Ive spent the whole night trying
to get laid so I wouldnt have any
regrets when I got married But Im
sitting here with my penis just
millimeters from entering you and I
realize that theres nothing I would
regret more than being unfaithful to
Julie Or at least any more unfaithful
than Ive already been I have to go

moves her off of him and pulls up his pants
YVETTE
You have permission to cheat Youre

not honestly going to walk away

STAN
I have to

before Stan can react Theyre bound together Stan holds up
his arm and stares at the cuffs in disbelief

YVETTE
I did that for your own good If
Julie really loved you she wouldnt
be willing to share you with anyone

STAN
She did it because she loves me that
much And I should have said no

YVETTE
You dont have to tell her we did
it I can keep a secret
STAN
Im going back out to the bonfire to
find Julie You have ten seconds to
put your bikini on or Im carrying
you out there as your are

Then paint me from memory like you
did before

DEVLIN
I dont wanna paint a memory I wanna
capture whats happening right now
The raw vulnerability of a woman who
knows her groom-to-be is cheating on
her Waiting for sunrise to see if
her relationship will survive

JULIE
Im not comfortable getting naked in
front of my ex-boyfriend who just
tried to kiss me

DEVLIN
Do you want some ecstasy Itll free
you up

JULIE
No

DEVLIN
Then have some more wine

He fills her glass

DEVLIN (CONTD)
Im an artist Julie Its like taking
your clothes off in front of a doctor

Julie sits in a chair and sips her wine Tears still in her
Stans on her mind She checks her watch

Devlin moves his easel in front of the bed He chooses a
large blank canvas and places it on the easel He collects
up his paints

JULIE
I bet that line has worked on lots
of women

DEVLIN

Im pretty sure it worked on you in
college You posed nude for me a
hundred times back then

JULIE
And as I recall it always ended with
us in bed together

DEVLIN
I see this being something really
beautiful Trust me Itll be
cathartic for both of us

JULIE
I wont cheat on Stan Im not
sleeping with you

DEVLIN
Theres no emotion in my life And
so theres been no emotion in my
work All I want from you is the
emotion youve brought here tonight
(pleading)
Please take off your clothes

EXT BEACH - NIGHT

Handcuffed together Stan and Yvette move through the crowd
near the BONFIRE as Stan looks for his friends

STAN
Where did you see them

YVETTE
Im not telling

STAN
Thank you for being mature and
understanding

YVETTE
Well youre a clit tease

STAN
Clit tease Is that a thing

YVETTE
Its the male version of a cock tease
You got me all hot and bothered and
you didnt finish what you started

Stan passes the Taxi Driver doing the limbo Stan realizes
who it was and turns back

STAN
Excuse me did you drop my friends
off here

TAXI DRIVER
Hey How many How many girls

STAN
None

TAXI DRIVER
None You didnt even nail the hooker

STAN
Where are my friends

TAXI DRIVER
(points)
Over there by the water

MOMENTS LATER - Stan and Yvette find the gang sitting on
beach chairs near the waters edge

STAN
Wheres Julie

KAREN
Why are you handcuffed to Yvette
Did you fuck her
(to Yvette)
Youre fired slut

RUSSELL
Those are not grounds for firing
someone

STAN

Where is Julie

TRENT
She went to see Devlin

STAN
Devlin the Bohemian artist guy In
New York

MARIE
Hes here

NEAL
Weve been trying to call to tell
you but some crazy Latina woman
keeps answering your cell

STAN
The pimps stole all my stuff Someone
give me your phone

Stan takes Russells phone and calls Julies cell

SPLIT SCREEN - Julies shattered cell on the highway It
gets run over again Stan gets her voicemail He hangs up
BACK TO SCENE

STAN (CONTD)
Shes not answering Why is she with
Devlin the Bohemian artist guy

BETH
Theyre just talking We think

STAN
I need to know where they are I
need to go see her

The guys shrug They dont know Stan looks to the ladies

KAREN
The same way you needed to resolve
your personal shit by trying to stick
your dick in any skank you could
find she had some personal shit to
resolve with Devlin So I think you
should just leave them alone

Worried Stan tries to call Julie again He leaves a voicemail
message

STAN
Hey Jules while this might not
technically be an emergency it feels
like an emergency so please call me
as soon as you get this I just wanna
make sure that you know I didnt
have sex with anyone

He hangs up

MARIE
Stan you know Julie is faithful

TRENT
Even if she thinks you were out all
night banging other women shes not
gonna sleep with Devlin

NEAL
She made a deal with you and that
was not part of the deal

KAREN
You have to trust her

STAN
You guys are right Julie would never
ever ever cheat on me

Russell is the only one who isnt sure

RUSSELL
I dont know Heres the thing about
cheating All guys know that its
possible theyll cheat if given the
opportunity So if we dont wanna
cheat were very careful not to put
ourselves in a position where it
might happen Most women on the
other hand think theyre incapable
of cheating and therefore they dont
have to guard themselves against it
You always have to beware of the
woman who thinks shed never cheat
because shell put herself ina
precarious situation Shell meet up
with an old boyfriend she hasnt
seen in ten years Theyll drink
some wine Reminisce The attraction
is there but she thinks she knows
herself She thinks she would never
cross that line So theyll have
some more wine Laugh Stare into
each others eyes for a little too
long Now shes thinking she should
probably put on the brakes but shes
never cheated before she can trust
herself So she has one more glass
of wine Next thing she knows
shes got her legs in the air and
hes balls deep for old times sake

This leaves Stan reeling Everyone realizes that Russell
might be right

STAN
Okay No fucking around Where exactly
is she I gotta go

INT KARENS LEXUS SUV - NIGHT

Karen drives Yvette is on Stans lap in the passenger seat
Marie Trent and Beth are in the backseat Neal and Russell
sit uncomfortably in the cargo area Theres a sense of
urgency as they speed toward South Beach

BETH
(near tears)
I thought I was one of those women
whod never cheat but I strayed once

TRENT
You cheated on me

BETH
Not you An ex I really didnt think
I had it in me to do what I did
RUSSELL
Thats what Im saying you all have
it in you

MARIE
Russell would definitely be an
authority on cheating

RUSSELL
At least I cheat because I want to
I dont do it on accident

NEAL
Karen Ive kept this inside for a
long time Im gonna say it now I
know you kissed your ski instructor
last winter in Vail

KAREN
Honey I swear on the lives of our
children I have never had any kind
of inappropriate physical contact
with another human being as long as
weve been together

NEAL

Okay I believe you I was just playing

a hunch I thought you might have

KAREN
Well I havent
(genuinely curious)
But if I had would you really wanna
know

NEAL
(thinks unsure)
Uhhhhh probably not

RUSSELL
Theres something to be said for
blissful ignorance If I hadnt told
Marie I cheated wed both still be

happy

MARIE
Its not the same A married person
having a minor indiscretion like a
kiss is one thing Being ina
relationship with a whoring scumbag
is something a person should know

RUSSELL
If you think of me as whoring scumbag
then why do you want me back

MARIE
I dont want you back dumbass I
just want you to be sorry for what
you lost

YVETTE
Someday he will be

Russell thinks Yvette might be right

STAN
Thats it No more talk about
cheating I dont wanna hear it

Everyone gets quiet The GPS announces Karens next turn

TRENT
You dont wanna do that Ive been
to South Beach a million times Its
faster if you make a right on Bayshore
before you get to Collins

KAREN
We paid two thousand dollars for the
GPS that talks to me Im listening
to her

Karen makes the turn and seconds later finds herself at a
dead stop cars lined up in front of her at a DRAW BRIDGE

Cars pull
going car

RUSSELL
See that Like all women your GPS
cannot be trusted

THE GIRLS
Shut up Russell

STAN
I dont have time for this

up behind her blocking her in A MOTORCYCLE COP
by car from the bridge comes to Karens window

MOTORCYCLE COP
The bridge is stuck Wont close
Relax It could be a while

The Cop continues on

STAN
(calling out)

emergency Fuck

Stan closes his eyes and repeatedly bangs the back of his
head against the headrest

INT DEVLINS LOFT - THAT MOMENT

Devlin and Julie roll around naked on a white bearskin rug

JULIE
I never thought I would cheat on
Stan but I cant help myself

DEVLIN

SMASH CUT TO
INTEXT KARENS LEXUS SUV - THAT MOMENT

Stans eyes pop open He was imagining that last scene The
gang is still stuck at the DRAW BRIDGE

STAN

college boyfriend on a bearskin rug

YVETTE

KAREN

KAREN

YVETTE

out of a moving car

MARIE
You put the handcuffs on Youre
going wherever he wants

STAN
I need shoes I cant jump out of a
moving car in my bare feet Ima

NEAL
Im a ten too but I do have odor
issues

STAN

Having smelly shoes on would be the
least of my concerns at this point

KAREN
You dont understand the stink on
his feet would be grounds for divorce
in most states

Neal pulls off his shoes and passes them forward Theyre
all horrified by the stink Beth actually dry heaves

The Lexus skids around the corner and nears the destination
Karen slows down Everyone wishes him luck

KAREN (CONTD)
Get ready

STAN
Okay guys thanks for everything

MARIE
Even if shes having sex with Devlin
Im sure she still loves you

Stan opens the car door

NEAL
Come bail us out when your done

EXT OCEAN DRIVE - CONTINUOUS

Stan and Yvette jump out and bounce off Julies Prius The
Lexus and the Motorcycle Cops keep going

A man on a mission Stan spots the loft entrance next to the
OCEAN DRIVE GALLERY He rushes over and hits the call button
The phone rings a bunch of times Stan waits anxiously

DEVLIN (ON SPEAKER)
Yeah

STAN
Devlin this is Stan Julies fiancé
I hope Im not interrupting anything

DEVLIN (ON SPEAKER)
In fact you are Its kinda late Or
early Come back later

STAN
Id like to speak to Julie

DEVLIN (ON SPEAKER)
(long beat)
Theres no one here by that name

STAN
I see her car Her cars right here

Devlin disconnects Stan tries the call button again but
gets a busy signal

YVETTE
He left it off the hook

Stan looks up at the loft Hows he gonna get in there He
looks in the alley right next door Theres a metal ladder
attached to the side of the building going up to the roof

The only problem is the ladder starts about ten feet off the
ground Stan runs to the ladder and looks up at it No way
he can reach it

He spots a nearby dumpster He pushes the dumpster under the
ladder with Yvette in tow

YVETTE (CONTD)
We cant climb the ladder together

STAN
Were going to

He helps her onto the dumpster With Yvette clinging to him
Stan awkwardly climbs the ladder

EXT LOFT ROOF - CONTINUOUS

Tangled together they fall over the ledge onto the roof
There are deck chairs and a table next to a door that must
lead to stairs down into the loft Stan tries the door but
its locked

YVETTE
Look

Yvette points to a skylight nearby They rush over to the
skylight and peer in Stan is stunned to see Julie naked on
the bed barely covered by satin sheets

YVETTE (CONTD)
(genuine )
Im sorry Stan

Totally dejected Stan stumbles over and sits in one of the
deck chairs Yvette pulls a chair close and sits Beat

YVETTE (CONTD)
Lets get out of here We can go
back to my place

Stan considers his options for a long moment He sighs
defeated He stands and slowly heads for the ladder

Just before he gets there he turns back refusing to quit
Stan marches toward the skylight calling out Julies name
over and over

STAN
Julie Julie Julie Julie

Without stopping or thinking he steps up onto the skylight
dragging a terrified Yvette with him He looks down and
bounces a few times still yelling for Julie

INT DEVLINS LOFT - THAT MOMENT

Devlin is painting Julie She breaks her pose and looks up
at the skylight Just then the glass CRACKS

STAN
Oh fuck

The skylight gives way Julie rolls to safety as Stan and
Yvette and SHATTERED GLASS fall towards her

Stan and Yvette bounce off the bed and land on their backs
on the floor Julie quickly wraps herself in the sheet
Stan gets

YVETTE
You jackass You could have killed
us

STAN
Julie am I too late

JULIE
Too late for what

up off the floor with Yvette

STAN
Do you still wanna be with me or
have you realized you really wanna be
with Devlin the Bohemian artist guy

JULIE
Dont be silly Stan I never thought
I wanted to be with Devlin instead
of you

STAN
Why are you naked in his loft

JULIE
He was painting me

Stan looks at Devlin standing in front of his easel
all over his hands

STAN
(annoyed at Devlin)
Why didnt you let me in

JULIE
Was that Stan at the door Why did
you lie to me

DEVLIN
I need to finish the painting

JULIE
Honey I promise you I came here
with noble intentions I just wanted
us both to start the new day with no
regrets

STAN
I didnt have sex with anyone

JULIE
You didnt

STAN
No A transsexual put my hand on her
penis

(MORE )

paint
STAN (CONTD)
I almost participated in a gang bang
I went home with a woman who lived
in a trailer and her five year old
son tried to stab me in the face
with a butcher knife I was tricked
into briefly going down on a woman
who was menstruating --

DEVLINYVETTE
Red Badge of Courage

STAN
-- So Im probably going to have to
be tested for a whole battery of
STDs I saved a Slovak girl from
forced sexual slavery And her pimps
stole all my stuff I got caught in
the crossfire when two adultering
cops tried to shoot each other I
turned down a blowjob from an underage
girl But then I did let Yvette suck
my dick for a minute However I
stopped short of actually penetrating
her because I realized after all
Ive been through tonight I dont
wanna sleep with anyone else

JULIE
You dont

STAN
There are a million great things
about being in a relationship And
at first I thought monogamy is the
punishment for all of those great
things But then I realized for
someone as lucky as me monogamy is
not a punishment I needed this night
to come to terms with who I am There
are men out there who believe that
one man plus one pussy does not equal
happiness but I dont believe that
If you find the right pussy one is
all you need And your pussy is
the right pussy for me

JULIE
(touched)
Oh Stan that is the least romantic
thing anyone has ever said to me

She hugs him He puts his arms around her pulling Yvette
along Through the huge window behind them the SUN can be

seen breaking the surface of the ocean
Stan eyes

JULIE (CONTD)
I just wanna say that Devlin did
kiss me but I cut him some slack
because hes on ecstasy

Devlin whos back to painting with his hands

STAN
Okay

JULIE
And as far as Im concerned we dont
ever need to talk about tonight again
I dont even wanna know why youre
handcuffed to Yvette

YVETTE
You got a really good guy here

JULIE
I know

Stan and Julie kiss and gaze into each others eyes And we
end as we began

JULIE (CONTD)
I love you

STAN
I love you too

FADE OUT

STAN (0S) (CONTD)
By the way we may have a little
trouble paying for the wedding
because I promised all our money to
the pimps
