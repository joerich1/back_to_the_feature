Introduction

Why This Book

Ultimately It’s All About Story The ability to tell an original compelling story is critical Without it
what’s in this book will not help you turn your generic idea into a salable script This book can show
you how to take your story and put it into a professionally acceptable format t’s All About Story
evolved from my frustration at trying to gather reliable information explaining how to effectively use the
elements that make up a screenplay In my search I discovered there is a vast sea of contradictory
information by various experts which confuses and mystifies the screenwriting process

Writers at all levels make the same common mistakes over and over which often causes a
readeragentactor production company to relegate a writer’s material to the trash And virtually nobody
(ie family friends agents production companies strangers) will tell you the truth about what they
think of your script assuming you can even get them to read your script Who then is this book for
This book is for the person who believes heshe has what it takes to succeed in one of the most
competitive industries in the world (professional screenwriting) I will review the skills which I believe
you need for success and how they get developed

Every year over 100000 scripts are generated If stacked flat they would stand over a mile and a half
high That’s a lot of reading and a lot of dead trees If you are like 99 percent of the people who believe
generating generic monstrosities are good enough then you are in for rejection heaven For your
screenplay to be noticed in this morass of product your story and screenplay have to be beyond
exceptional You will not achieve this unless you can master all the elements making up storytelling in
the form of a screenplay

You say look at all the crap movies produced I can do that Well if you are famous rich or amazingly
lucky you too can have people interested in your generic story Otherwise you must rely on talent and
hard work This book is to help those with potential craft their talent in writing a screenplay that others
will notice Like everyone else I initially bought many of the popular screenwriting books They all
gave useful advice though often contradictory But all were missing enough examples of crafting the
elements of screenwriting into a good screenplay and why or why not these elements should be used
From the Internet I downloaded thousands of professional scripts of popular movies What surprised me
was the inconsistency in following script guidelines the poor quality of writing and the lack of original
storytelling I’ve addressed these shortcomings in this book

Can this book help you become a great screenwriter No Only hard work and talent combined with the
information in this book can help you realize your potential This book gives you the tools and shows
you how to use them to become a better writer It can act as a useful reference in the future This book
will serve as a screenwriting guide that offers a plethora of screenwriting examples It gives clear
understandable explanations in writing techniques in the craft of screenwriting

TOC

One of the most annoying things in most of the popular screenwriting books is that they are long on
humor and sarcasm but short on content They are very entertaining But when I want to go back over

lost its entertainment value I have kept both of these to a minimum to pack useful Information which
can be accessed quickly through the ‘Table of Contents’

What Is A Screenplay

A screenplay is a 90 — 120-page document written in Courier 12pt font on 8 12 x 11 Courier font is
used because one formatted script page in Courier font equals roughly one minute of screen time Thats
why the average page count of a screenplay should come in between 90 and 120 pages Comedies tend
to be on the shorter side (90 pages or 14 hours) while Dramas run longer (120 pages or 2 hours) If
printed and bound it must be on bright white punched paper

Note Some say these days the range is between 85 - 115 but I believe if you keep your script 120
pages or less you’re ok

A screenplay can be an original piece or based on a true story or previously written piece like a novel
stage play or newspaper article It is a blueprinttemplate for the film The producer director set
designer stunt people and actors all translate the screenwriters vision with their talents using the
screenplay as a starting point Since the creation of a film is a collaborative art the screenwriter must
write the screenplay in such a way as to give each artist the creative space to practice their unique
talents Don’t be a director Don’t have long flowery descriptions of locations or characters because that
will change Just write the best story you can in the simplest terms possible

TOC

Since film is primarily a visual and auditory medium the screenwriter must SHOW what’s happening in
a story Inner monologues may be great in a novel but are death in a screenplay The screenwriter must
be able to show a story on the screen through the actions of the actors interacting with each other and
their environment In film a critical moment may be conveyed through something as simple as the look
on an actor’s face A great movie will convey meaning through both visual and auditory Subtext

A screenplay is NOT a play nor a novel Unlike the novelist who has complete freedom to explore any
point of view shift between conscious and subconscious mind explore a character or a story from
multiple perspectives etc the screenwriter MUST write in Present Tense and focusing on what the
audience can See and Hear (though all of the five senses can be used to convey the ambiance of the
story to the reader) Not the inner thoughts of the character (the exception is ‘Voice Over’ which can
reveal the inner thoughts of a character)

Note A Spec Script is simply a script for which you ’re not getting paid You should not use Camera
Shots or Transitions in these scripts (exception FADE IN and FADE OUT) A Spec Script is written for a
script reader and camera shots and transitions annoy them by interrupting the flow of the story making
it more difficult to understand They also realize that you are not the director or anyone up the economic
food chain

A script is a document that drafts every aural visual behavioral and lingual element required to tell a
story Why drafts Because a film is a highly collaborative medium and the director cast editor and
production crew will be based on your draft they will interpret your story their way when it is filmed
They may consult you or they may not Other writers may be brought in or you may be asked to rewrite
the entire script Thats life in the world of screenwriting But because so many people are involved in
making a film a script must conform to standards that all involved parties understand and thus has a
specific format or layout margins notation and other conventions This book is intended to cover the
typical elements used in screenplay writing It is crucial to remember that film is a visual medium You
dont tell your audience your story you show them You must learn to write a screenplay visually Write
about what they will see and what they will hear You might love your characters and know what they
are thinking but the discipline of screenwriting is how to show it on a screen When it happens it may
be done with a look often improvised on the movie set So just write the pictures sounds and speeches
and leave the rest for the filmmakers

Steps To Screenwriting Success

It is not easy to achieve success at anything It’s been said screenwriting is one of the hardest crafts in
the world to master Countless people dream of success as screenwriters Only a few succeed No matter
what you have heard if you wish to be noticed you must be better than 99 percent of your competition
It requires a dedication of time and effort at learning the craft of storytelling and it requires talent If
you REALLY want to achieve success these are the steps I believe are needed to give yourself a chance
If this seems too difficult then pick another career that is better suited to your natural talents There Are
No Shortcuts

TOC

1 Watch Thousands of Movies

Watch as many movies in as many genres as possible Especially newer movies because audience’s
tastes change with time

Why The more movies you watch the easier it will be to identify stories that work characters that
fascinate original story arcs work and it will allow you to gain a deeper understanding of story pacing
Each generation tells stories a little differently Tastes change these days with faster pacing and more
subtext in Action and dialogue In the past you’d see a scene of a person getting into a car driving to a
destination walking up to a door knocking on the door and waiting until the occupant would answer
Today we’d cut to the door being kicked in without all the run-up

Personal Experience Over the years I’ve watched thousands of movies I’ve seen how they are
presented differently today From this experience I’ve learned what works and what doesn’t By
observing the different themes and storylines that make compelling stories I’m better able to duplicate
them in my own stories

2 Read Thousands of Screenplays

Read as many screenplays as possible in different genres If possible do so in combination with seeing
the movie Read screenplays that have recently been made into movies Read screenplay scripts on their
own because it will force you to have only the words on the page to elicit an emotional response and not
influenced by the acting directing editing cinematography set design and music one gets when
watching the film

Why Most people have difficulty following a script It’s not a novel Reading scripts helps to
understand screenplay form as well as to understand how the page translates to the screen You get a
sense of different screenwriting styles voices whether the writing is clear and concise or muddled and
rambling or if the story pulls together or falls apart Reading scripts will help you see how white space
is maximized

Personal Experience I’ve read over a thousand screenplays This has helped me get a better grasp on
proper screenwriting structure and the shortcomings in the stories and films that have bored me

See ‘Movie Scripts A-M’ ‘Movie Scripts N-Z’ ‘TVScripts A-M’ ‘TV Scripts N-Z’

3 Write a Lot

Write a lot Make it a part of your daily routine Being a writer — paid or not — is a calling

Why It’s been said to become good at anything requires a fabled ten thousand hours of focused effort
If you had a full-time job of 40 hours a week it would take over five years to develop your expertise
And that is with FOCUSED CONCENTRATION not just showing up and going through the motions
Since most people don’t have eight free hours a day it means it’Il take over a decade And that is just to
get into the ball game against other skilled screenwriters

Personal Experience From thousands of hours of writing I have discovered at each stage of
development I reach a point at which my writing no longer improves I call it churning At this point
the rewritten words feel no better than the previous words But as I developed new writing skills and
came back to a project I was surprised at how I could transform my previous work into what I felt was
of a higher quality

TOC

4 Develop Lots of Story Ideas

The more unique original stories you have worked out the better the chances you will be prepared when
an opportunity presents itself As they say “Luck Favors the Prepared”

Why There’s a likelihood that if allowed to present your material they will not be interested in
precisely what you’re offering Often they will ask you what other story ideas do you have If you have
none the conversation will often end and they will excuse themselves and like Keyser Séze they will
vanish never to be seen again An opportunity will have been lost The longer you can engage people
the greater the chances you and your stories will connect Like anything the more you practice creating
storylines the better you will become at it Practicing storytelling will help you develop an ability to
create a story on the fly which a potential client might wish to acquire

Personal Experience I’ve always been interested in different story ideas ‘what if’s’ which pop into
my head This can be a blessing or a curse I always have another story to present if asked ’what else’
A curse because I often find it difficult to finish my current story because of the excitement I have at
developing a new idea When a new story idea comes over me I create a Master Story Document
which contains necessary story information such as title genre theme concept pictures characters
taglines loglines synopsis outline treatment notes and research information I put it away and carry
on with my current project As new ideas on a new story arise I make a quick entry into my master story
document This gives me a catalog of exciting stories to fall back on

5 Write What Excites You

You have to get to where you’re inspired because the real magic originates from inside

Why If there is no passion then you will not be able to sustain the focused concentration needed to do
the best job you can

Personal Experience I find that my favorite genres are Sci-fi Horror Comedy Romance Action-
Adventure Thriller and Suspense Most of my stories are drawn from imaginings of what would I do
‘IF’ something in this world or a future world changed How would I react

6 Become An Expert

The reason most stories fail is the writer does not have a good enough grasp and command of hisher
story world They use clichés in place of original thoughts because of their lack of understanding of their
characters their motivations their voices location depth of knowledge on the subject they are writing
about possible story threads etc If you don’t have a command of your story world then you don’t have
access to the details needed to create the original ideas required to develop a compelling story It’s a
plague of ignorance that forces a writer to grab at tired actions and dialogue they’d seen or heard
countless times

Why Why do most writers do their best writing when talking about themselves or their personal
experiences or about an area they are EXPERTS in It’s because they have a commanding grasp of their
world They have DETAILS that they can draw on which gives AUTHORITY to a story

TOC

Cliché Is an action or dialogue that is overused and familiar It betrays a lack of original thought Never
use clichés Every cliché found in your writing is a chance to show the storyteller’s brilliance Replace
an overused cliché with an authentic moment When a readeraudience runs across a cliché their brain
goes numb and it shuts off Because for a moment they don’t need to think Too many of these moments
and the readeraudience completely disengages as they move onto something more interesting On the
other hand when a reader audience runs across original action or dialogue their minds engage at the
novelty pulling them deeper into the story

Note Never Say Never If used sparingly a well-placed cliché can help anchor the reader audience to
the moment and allow their brain to take a momentary breather from processing all the revelations
being thrown at them But do not use them as a crutch for original thinking

Personal Experience I am by profession a software developer and a scientist I program in over a
dozen computer languages with an emphasis on website development and pattern recognition I love
exploring cutting edge technology I am by nature an adventurer I have participated in a dozen
different sports Rock Climbing Swimming Water Polo Wrestling Football Track and Field (Quarter and
Half-Mile Javelin Shot Put) Distance Running (5K through 100 milers) Kayaking Archery
Skydiving and Scuba Diving I am also a pianist composer and songwriter I’ve served as a Sergeant in
the Marine Corps I’ve always had a sense of adventure which has found me in many life and death
situations I’ve become intimate with pain fear and death I’ve experienced the ecstasy of love and
trauma of love lost I bring these experiences to my writing We each have a plethora of personal
experiences we can incorporate into our stories Use them to create original compelling stories

How One Becomes An Expert

¢ Life Experience understanding firsthand how you or others react in life situations gives one an edge
up on believability There is nothing like the in-depth knowledge and emotional connection one gains
from living a real-life adventure that burns a mark into one’s soul and allows one to present one’s
ORIGINAL interpretation to life Stress reveals one’s true nature and character If you haven’t lived it
you can only guess at how a character would react You will not have the details which convincingly
show authenticity

Why Have you ever noticed how a person’s best writing comes when they write a personal story about
themselves The reason is as people reach into their memories they see details which help illuminate
their story That’s why many young novelists write stories without any depth of understanding of human
nature Their stories often come off as juvenile and unauthentic without any of life’s nuances
Personal Experience See Become An Expert

Observation carefully observing how others behave in situations and translating their experiences
into your own stories help give AUTHORITY to a character and helps validate personal experiences
you’ve never had Trying to honestly think of how you would react in situations help AUTHENTICATE
the reality of the story

Why Every day we see how human nature plays out by observing how those about us behave in
situations they encounter in their lives With careful observation these experiences can be translated into
our stories giving a greater measure of AUTHENTICITY

TOC

Personal Experience I’ve collected an eccentric group of friends in different areas of life I draw on
their personal experiences to enrich my own stories

Reading Extensively There are countless memoirs and personal stories that include every experience
a human can have A synthesis of these experiences in unique situations can add an authenticity that
makes your story believable and compelling

Why Without the authenticity to impart details the audience has never seen or experienced before the
audience disconnects from the story because they have heard the dialogue or saw the same action
hundreds of times

Personal Experience I love reading stories that place people at the edge of human experience A few
of my favorite books of human triumph ‘Touching the Void’ ‘Into Thin Air’ Endurance
Shackleton’s Incredible Voyage’ I can extract from their individual experiences to help create credible
stories

7 Create An Outline See Outline

An outline is a scene—by—scene breakdown of your story a blueprint written (basically) in narrative
form It mostly is a short description of the Action played out in each scene what characters are
involved minimum rudimentary dialogue and notes that help you later translate this into the actual
screenplay Writing an outline is more of an analytical process while writing the screenplay is more
emotional and visceral This is because when you write a screenplay you are giving life to the story and
characters The outline is the document in which you work out the storyline

Why When you are putting together a story you are mainly interested in seeing if the story makes
sense and if the story threads come together into a satisfying climax Since these are just narrative notes
you are not concerned with the details of dialogue which when written in a script becomes difficult to
modify or remove if the story calls for it

Personal Experience When I first started writing screenplays I’d open Final Draft and start writing In
my head I had a beginning several exciting events in the middle and a satisfying ending But as I
plowed forward I spent a significant amount of time getting action lines just right and creating
wonderful dialogue

Moving deeper into the story I’d often come up with clever story threads that required me to either
abandon earlier scenes or try to jimmy them into the new story direction Rather than chucking
previously written scenes that now didn’t make sense I’d write clunky scene bridges The more time I’d
spent on a scene the less inclined I was to throw it away This harmed my creativity because I’d be
hesitant to throw away hours or days of work to develop a better story

8 Create a Master Story Document See Story Master Document

Create a document that contains all the information related to a script This might include title genre
theme concept pictures characters taglines loglines synopsis outline treatment notes and research
information

Why Before you write any script you should have a document that contains all the useful information
related to putting together your story

Personal Experience When I think up a new movie idea I immediately go to my computer and create
a folder with the working name of the film Then I open Microsoft Word and create a master story

Synopsis Character List OutlineTreatment and Notes

9 Create Unforgettable Characters

Stories are only as good as the characters you create We have to feel they are real that they can react to
the world around them as we would that they have flaws like ourselves We must see some aspects of
ourselves in a story’s characters

Why If we don’t care and have empathy for a character then we don’t care what happens to them And
if we don’t care then there is no suspense And we don’t develop empathy if characters don’t act
humanely

Personal Experience Some people’s personality seals a bond by making us relate to the person as a
kindred spirit I enjoy witty charming characters People like this make me laugh and want to engage in
their adventures and how they react to life Other people not so much—they are just boring

10 Develop Engaging Original Stories

A good story is about an interesting character who wants something badly and is having a great deal of
trouble getting it (Character Desire) x Obstacles Story There’s a lot more to the final execution of a
story than just the broad strokes of an equation You must engage the readeraudience This is not done
by having a story the readeraudience has seen a hundred times or tired retreaded dialogue that
disengages the readeraudience or scenes we’ve seen a hundred times and can predict the outcome
DON’T BE BORING

Why Anything that disengages the readeraudience even for a moment has the chance to shut down
your story completely Stories that we’ve heard before or that we can predict can become boring and
cause the readeraudience to switch off

Personal Experience I once kayaked alone from Santa Monica to Catalina Island in a storm I was
personally 100 physically and mentally engaged Why Because I didn’t know how the story would
end Would I live or die There was plenty of suspense and I was fully engaged in what the outcome
would be Make your readeraudience care about your characters as much as they would for themselves

11 Know the Theme

Theme is defined as the main idea or an underlying meaning that may be stated directly or indirectly It
aligns and focuses on the plot subplots characters and dialogue It is the Rosetta Stone which allows
you to translate that great concept you have into a great screenplay It’s the driving intention behind the
film It’s the message the writer is trying to get across to the audience which when effectively
communicated satisfies them emotionally and analytically and makes them feel they’ve just watched a
great film It is in a single sentence or a single word what the movie is all about It doesn’t matter what
the theme is — courage love conquers all real beauty is on the inside be careful what you wish for
redemption betrayal loyalty self-worth ambition jealousy hypocrisy obsession alienation life sucks
and then you die etc if you effectively prove or disprove it you’ ve succeeded as a writer

If youve ever been bewildered about what your characters should do or say next chances are you either
didnt know that the theme drives plot and dialogue or you never fully developed your theme While the
plot is the action that drives the story forward the theme gives the story events meaning It is a vital part

TOC
of a story that resonates with the audience long after they’ve left the theater

If the plot is what’s on the surface of a film easily visible to the audience then the theme is the subtext
what’s under the surface waiting to be uncovered Themes are sometimes called a life lesson or a
message and the best ones are always subtle

Even with the most fantastic characters in the most incredible situations if there is no point in the story
there is little point in writing the screenplay Why tell the story The central theme of your story is the
foundation of everything and the most important motivating factor for writing the script And since
theme and conflict are crucially linked it is through an exploration of your central character that will
guide you into that conflict because the theme is always rooted in the protagonist’s primary goal See
Theme

Why Understanding the theme allows you to bring all the threads of the story together in a meaningful
way

Personal Experience I wrote a screenplay about women empowerment ‘Courage’ It portrayed a team
of athletically talented women from different sports band together against a patriarchal culture that
demands they conform to a tradition that limits their life options It was an excellent story that became
even more powerful once I realized the theme was about aspects of courage Focusing on the theme
allowed me to shape the story threads and many of the scenes to reflect the underlying meaning that
connected everything

12 Writing is Rewriting

You write you rewrite and you rewrite some more The final product is only good because you busted
your butt draft after draft after draft All writing is rewriting period

Why As you write your screenplay your imagination kicks in and you think of better scenes you can
craft as you gain a greater command of your story world

Personal Experience When I rewrite a script I usually take one scene at a time and ask myself how
can I make this better How can I make this more original Every script I rewrite over a dozen times
Because I don’t believe good enough is ever good enough Also I’m always embarrassed by the
spellinggrammardialogue actionstory of every previous version of my script If you believe you can
transform any scene into one more original - you can

13 Critical Feedback

You’ve finished your screenplay and now it’s the agonizing process of waiting for feedback Without
feedback you’re lost You need brutally honest feedback from other writers

Why You cannot evaluate your writing because what you wrote seemed good when you wrote it If you
put the work away for a period you’ll find what at one time seemed brilliant has often lost its luster with
time But a fresh set of eyes from a fellow writer with comparable or better skills and has never seen
your work doesn’t see the brilliance you displayed They see only your faults

Personal Experience Many times I’ve written what I thought was an excellent script Yet when I had
a friend read it and make a comment on specific shortcomings I almost always agreed with them and
wondered why I didn’t catch the problem myself Indeed it’s always easier to see problems in someone
else’s writing

TOC

14 A Story Must Make Sense

A screenplay must-have scenes that connect characters that make sense in the genre they are in and
have dialogue that supports the story

Why If the readeraudience can’t follow the story then they disengage and they stop readingwatching
Personal Experience I read my scripts to my NOVEL writing group They are not used to reading
screenplays If they can’t follow what’s happening in the story then I try to write my narrative in a more
story-like fashion

15 Don’t be a Secret Keeper

I have found that most writers believe their story idea is precious the most unique idea anyone has ever
thought up and if it got out someone would steal it So to safeguard their precious story they hide it
from the world or make demands on those they do share it with This informs everyone they are
paranoid Being a Secret Keeper Will Keep You Out of the Entertainment Business PERIOD

Why 1) People can’t buy your stuff if they don’t know it exists 2) People don’t want to sign any Non-
Disclosure Agreement because they will think you will sue them if they develop a similar idea 3) The
more people you communicate your ideas with the greater your chance that you will be noticed 4) They
perceive you as being difficult to work with 5) If you only have a few ideas why are you wasting your
time

Personal Experience ‘Ideas Are a Dime a Dozen’ It is the details of the execution that is everything I
take the attitude that I can develop any story idea better than anyone else If someone is foolish enough
to take any of my story ideas and turn them into a screenplay I would always be able to create a better
screenplay By projecting this to people I convince them I am the best person to write theirmy
screenplay This attitude attracts people wanting to work with me on any of my own or their story ideas

16 Grit

Dedication Determination Fortitude Resolve Perseverance Pick your word of choice because if you
want to be a screenwriter its the only way youll survive Screenwriting is a tough business Your
courage and endurance to fight through the adversity of writing a screenplay will only make you
stronger And then all you have to do is do it again and again and again And eventually after a
decade you will have overnight success

Why Having a thin skin is sure death in writing You can’t learn and grow if you don’t eagerly accept
criticism rejection and being told you and your story ideas and writing is crap Grit also requires you to
write when you don’t feel like it Remember to reach your potential at anything requires those ten
thousand hours of focused concentration

Personal Experience I’ve stayed up late many nights making changes to a script so it’s the best I can
offer at any given moment I’ve listened to people’s lukewarm reaction to different stories and wondered
why they aren’t as enthusiastic as I am So I go back to writing until I get a consensus of enthusiasm

What to Do To Become A Writer

Tell everyone you know that you’re a writer

Offer to read and review anything they have written

At your regular job notify everyone that you are also a serious writer and offer to help them if they
write You never know who you’re going to meet so always be ready to pitch your skills

Create a web presence (websiteblog) as a business card that shows the world you’re serious

Your first sale usually come through your contacts even after signing with an agentmanager

Ask friendsrelatives if they know anyone in the business Could they provide an introduction

Join screenwriting groups or start one of your own

Exchange contact information with fellow screenwriters

Your goal is to get each contact to read your script and give you their opinion on it

Ask a contact for advice This is always flattering and always helpful to you

Remember to ask if they can suggest other contacts

Attend screenwriting workshops and seminars save class lists and keep in touch

Chat with the seminar speaker Send a follow-up letter Ask for advice on your script

Use the Internet

Join screenwriting newsgroups and mailing lists

Read the industry trades Know the market and the players

Keep in touch with all your contacts at least a few times a year

Persistence is the key to success

Why You will find that successful people at anything know people who can help them achieve their

goals The only way this can happen is if you get out there and advertise yourself so people know you

exist and what your skills are The more people that know you are a writer the better your chances of

someone noticing your skills

Personal Experience All of my writing jobs have come because someone either in the entertainment

industry has put me in contact with someone looking for my skills or a person outside the industry knew

I was a writer and steered me to someone in the industry Before I had any success I used to critique

friends and stranger’s novels and screenplays often for free My break in writing came when a friend I’d

helped (for free) develop a short story Later he asked if I’d write a treatment on a person he’d been

commissioned to write He said he was lost in figuring out what to write and since he knew I was a

better writer would I do the assignment I agreed and when a film company showed interest in the

man’s story and liked my treatment they phoned me and asked if I’d like to critique some of the film

scripts they were interested in producing I agreed They also were interested in doing a western and

wanted to know if I had any That night I came up with an outline of an exciting western that interested

them and that was the start of my career as a professional screenwriter

18 Connect

If the audience isn’t invested in the story if they don’t care about the characters if they’re not intimately
involved discovering anticipating predicting and reaching conclusions well then you’ve already lost
Remember as a screenwriter you’re selling to a readeraudience You’re writing for them — so they can
laugh cry hope scare and fear But don’t force-feed them dribble they’ve heard or seen a hundred
times before Your audience is smart Never tell the story Show it and let people come to their
conclusions This will engage your readeraudience

TOC

Why If you don’t connect with your readeraudience then you have wasted your time and theirs If this
is the case you must rethink your story and characters until you do connect

Personal Experience A writing friend wrote a horror script I critiqued it (for free) and made several
suggestions to make it an original story When I gave him recommendations he thanked me but said he
just wanted to make a generic horror movie He believed investors would want to make such a script
and audiences would want to see it HE WAS WRONG If you have this mindset you are wasting your
time and genuinely don’t understand film Since he didn’t want to use any of my ideas I created an
original story from those ideas in a Dark ComedyHorrorRomance entitled ‘PETA — People Eating
Tasty Animals’

19 Understand Genre

When it comes to most genres people rarely go to the movies to be surprised They know the action
hero will survive that the girl will get the guy and the villains will get their just deserts In reality
however love’s painful and often the bad guys win but in the movies love is the holy elixir and the
hero saves the day Screenwriting is seldom about reinventing audience expectations The key to writing
a sellable screenplay is to understand genres (and subgenres) and exceed audience expectations

Why A person searches out a specific genre when they go to the movies The audience has expectations
for every genre In a horror movie an audience would be highly upset to find they’re in a Masterpiece
Theatre movie or vice versa Write to a genre

Personal Experience I love science fiction and when I see a movie in this genre I expect fantastic out
of this world technology compelling dangers grounded in understandable concepts of science

20 Have a Web Presence

You should have a website and blog on the Internet

Being a software developer I also create websites and blogs for people from personal sites
‘TheScriptSavantcom’ to mega-sites such as one I helped develop for Paramount’s Entertainment
Tonight ‘Etonlinecom’

Why It shows youre serious It allows you to put up samples of your workservices It acts as an
extended business card and contact point A Web presence separates you from over 90 of your
competition

Personal Experience To show those interested in my abilities I have created websites related to a
variety of talents in which I direct interested parties The greater your presence in the world the better
the chances that someone will notice you

A Few of My Websites

21 Formatting Grammar and Punctuation

With programs like Final Draft there is no excuse for formatting errors With spell-check and the ability
to look up grammar and punctuation on the Internet there is little excuse for these errors either

Why Misspelled words or grammarpunctuation errors almost always scream lazy and amateur
Personal Experience When I read a person’s script and I spot a misspelled word or poor grammar
punctuation I start paying more attention to what OTHER mistakes are in the script so that I can send it
to the trash From my scripts I find spellinggrammarpunctuation errors virtually every time I reread
them which I immediately correct This reminds me never to hand out my first few drafts

22 Write Powerful Scenes

The scene is essential to movie making After all a film is just a bunch of scenes strung together to
create a comprehensive whole Start scenes at the last possible moment and get out early Creative
brevity in the screenplay is a necessity so writing scenes that are clear and concise while always
moving the story forward and revealing character while still engaging the reader

Why Every scene counts They are building blocks to an engaging satisfying film Don’t include a
scene unless it advances the story or develops a character

Personal Experience All the movies I enjoy have scenes I emotionally connect with

23 Deliver Dynamic Dialogue

Screenplay Dialogue

has a rhythm

is easily spoken

it’s brief

moves rapidly

have verbal exchanges volleying back and forth between characters
shifts power from one side to the other until somebody scores the point
is full of conflict

rarely do characters say exactly what they mean

dialogue is all about subtext

when faced with the need for exposition utilize the visual medium

TOC

avoid the temptation of voice over unless its use compliments the story

Why Movies are only 2 hours long so dialogue must be compact and carry as much meaning to
advance the story as possible People get bored and disengage with On-The-Nose dialogue and everyday
Chit—ChatSmall—Talk Movies are not like real life Leave out everything boring

Personal Experience Often while listening to people I desperately want them to get to the point they
are trying to make and sometimes Ill interrupt their ramblings to fill in their thoughts so that we can

move on

24 Cost of Production

As you write your script takes into account the cost of production If you have special effects exotic
locations animals crowds multiple locations car chases period pieces giant music scores of
recognizable songs famous actors etc each contributes to the cost of production Most movies
produced are for less than 5 million dollars Only a few companies produce 100 million-dollar movies
and they usually have their own writers

Why The vast majority of movies produced are low budget (less than 5 million) This means giving a
high budget script to most producers is a waste of time They won’t look at it If you read the reviews on
many of the script websites like ‘The Black List’ they talk of their concern about production costs
when they critique the viability of a script It makes sense that it is easier to have your script recognized
in the bigger market of low budget scripts When you are a famous scriptwriter then you can dust off
that 100 million project you’ve been working on for a decade

Personal Experience I’ve been asked many times if I could write an inexpensive script that takes place
in a single location especially horror movies

25 You’re Writing Only For A Reader

Your spec script is being written for a reader — not for the director or producer not the final shooting
script

Why In a production-ready screenplay the director may truncate scenes to the point that words alone
wouldn’t convey a connected story The director has words images and audio clues to convey the story
On a spec script if the reader with only your words to convey the story gets lost or confused even for a
moment your script could end in the trash

TOC

Chapter 1 Script Sections

Action

is the scene description character movement and sounds as described in a screenplay

1 Every Block Of Action Should IDEALLY Be 4 Lines Or Less Before Introducing White Space
blank line

Why Large blocks of text in action are intimidating to the reader which tend to skim over these
missing the impact of your words the subtext or important points that may be needed to understand and
connect with the story Large blocks of unbroken action have the effect of having the reader lose the
thread of the story White space a blank line between action blocks helps the reader focus one thought
at a time on what you are trying to convey

2 Write Visually Show Don’t Tell - No Talking Heads

Why Movies are a visual and auditory experience The reader producer and talent you wish to attract
to your script must live the experience in their minds Each scene must form a visual image in their
mind so they can connect with the story

3 Write What The Camera Can SEE Or HEAR On The Screen

Why It is true that if the camera cannot see it we don’t’ see it Cameras can’t read minds But in
descriptions all the senses of Sight Sound Touch Smell and Taste are employed to give a greater
visualization of what is happening for the reader and audience

4 Write in Present Tense using Active Voice
Why A movie takes place in the NOW The more dramatically REAL you can make a scene with
Active Voice the better

5 Never Use Camera Shots In Your Spec Script (Applies To Writing A Spec Script)

Why It annoys the director because that is his job It shows you’re an amateur slows the reading and
lengthens the script Exception if you are the writer and director and film funder or you are writing a
shooting script

6 Convey Emotions Subtext And Inner Character With A Combination Of Dialogue And
Action Resort To Dialogue Only When Its Impossible To Do Otherwise - Try To Show What Is
Happening

Why The action should set up the character so we understand the context of their dialogue Most
understanding comes from the subtext of how a person stands speaks moves stares etc Showing what
is happening engages the readeraudience more than dialogue

7 Only Capital Lower Case Letters And Underline Are Used In Action — Never Bold Italics
Why In action lines normally use lower case letters are used except if a proper name then the first
letter is capitalized a character is being introduced for the first time in which case the name is

TOC

capitalized - Only this first time any important sounds are capitalized or you need to make the reader
notice a word or phrase it may be capitalized or underlined so later in the story has significance in order
to clue in the reader that this is important or the word is used as a sub-heading to focus attention on
Keep capitalization to a minimum or they lose impact Also the more capitalization the less the reader
will take any single one as significant which if glossed over may lose the impact it has with the climax
of the story Personal In my screenplay ‘Courage’ a female police officer warns our protagonist after
an attempt is made on her life that she should be armed If glossed over or skipped by the reader the
dramatic confrontation with the antagonist at the end would seem to have materialized out of nowhere
and appear to make little logical sense

8 Never Use Clichés - Any Overused Phrase Both In Dialogue And Action
Why They put the reader into comaautopilot and shows a lack of originality It causes the reader to
skip ahead Rewriting clichés with original ideas shows brilliance and engages the reader

9 Remove Most If Not All Adverbs And Adjectives Find The Right Verb And Noun
Why Adverbs and adjectives make the sentences weak indecisive longer and less clear Any extra
words dull the impact on the readeraudience

10 Employ Mystery

This is the presence that is not present — the hidden catalyst or inexplicable disturbance that forces
choice and Action Mystery hides information from the audience to make them ask “how come”

Why As a mystery it stands behind the goals and plans of every dramatic character It’s the source of
the audience’s key questions and suspicions regarding a character’s identity their back-stories and their
current condition When an audience is alert to the possibility that a character’s actions might actually

99 «6

hide more than they reveal when questions concerning “what” “why” and “who” give rise to an

uneasiness that provokes uncertainty and increasing anxiety you can be sure that mystery is afoot

11 Employ Suspense

It puts the audience in a position of privileged perception Suspense conceals information from the
characters to make the audience wonder “what now”

Why When an audience sees or hears something which threatens a character’s well-being which is
identified but isn’t apparent to the character suspense thrives Without suspense the reader audience
will not engage in the characters or story and will become bored

Write to set the pace of the scene The faster the Action — the more you’ll want to break up the sentences
and paragraphs to create a sense of direction For Spec Scripts it’s best to keep the details to only the
most essential points necessary to keep the story moving along Avoid generic phrases or clichés that
don’t contribute to our understanding of the character or situation Always try to give the characters
something to do that gives us insight into their character

What Requires ALL-CAPS In Action (Put Only Things That Matter in CAPS)
the first time in the script a character name appears in an action line
important sound effects

TOC

important props
essential details you wish the reader to recall in the future
Secondary Scene Heading — focuses attention on characterlocationelement or detail

Action 1

first-time character (KAT JOHNSON) is seen in action that character is capitalized - every other time
the character is seen in an action line heshe is not capitalized - it is also a good idea when a character

is introduced to include their age - readers react differently to different character’s ages - if there is any
doubt as to their gender include this the first time they are introduced

all-important sounds are capitalized throughout all the action lines (CRACKLES BARKS
WHIMPERS)

important prop (FEDERAL EXPRESS PACKAGE) says how the supernatural entity reached Kat

important details that are important to be noticed later in the script by the reader are capitalized
(CLOUD OF EMBERS infers then and later to a supernatural entity)

Example 1 Action Correct

EXT HOME — NIGHT

INT BEDROOM — NIGHT

INT BEDROOM — LATER

(above CAPITALIZATION highlights tells the reader to pay attention — could have underlined also)

Action 2

must CAPITALIZE first time detective in Action line his age is stated (age could be 40’s also)

the FORENSIC EXPERTS are seen for the first time so they are capitalized - since they are not
important to advancing the plot their gender and age are left out

the POLICE WOMAN has a speaking part and it’s her first time - she is capitalized along with her

age
TOC

the Police Woman capitalizes SLAPS to emphasize the importance of her next words
the word ARMED is capitalized because we wish the reader to remember this in the future

Example 2 Action Correct

POLICE WOMAN

POLICE WOMAN

TOC

(Hopefully we remember the word ARMED later when Alena confronts the antagonist)
‘Courage’

Action lines are used to describe the main story They also describe the effort to attain an objective
involving the character’s thought emotion and will In other words action implies the pursuit of a goal

Most of a screenplay is the description of the actions and activities of the characters Effective
screenwriters think of the actions of the characters and how the audience should see them This is the
heart of dramatic writing

Note Drama is anticipation mingled with uncertainty

Action reveals character It’s not what a character says but what a character does that is important The
old adage “actions speak louder than words” is a general truth What matters is not what happens it is
how the character reacts to what is happening

You must get into the inner lives of your characters — their joys torments secret desires aspirations and
hidden fears It is the juxtaposition of dialogue and action very often mismatched that gives us our
clearest picture of the inner world of a character

Action 3
always employ the number symbol () when referring to numbered characters

a character’s age should be written as numerals set off by commas or a trend to enclose in
parentheses with just a space right of the name

to minimize any possibility of confusion (and to make the script easier to read) avoid naming two
principal characters with the same initial letter (eg Bill and Bob) or names that can be easily
confused ( eg Kathy and Cathy) or names that rhyme (eg Ted and Ned)

when indicating a sound effect only one word should appear in ALL CAPS - for example you might
write “the SOUND of rocks striking the wall” or “the sound of the ball HITTING the floor”

any word that describes one or more people such as CROWD PEOPLE TEENAGERS KIDS or
ZOMBIES should always be placed in CAPS as should any key props and any words that describe
important sounds (eg GUNSHOT CRASH BOOM CLICK SWISH BANG etc)

Example 3 Action Correct

INT FALCON’S VILLA — CONFERENCE ROOM — DAY

FALCON

PROMOTER 1

when wrapping lines do not insert hyphens to break words

text that is visible onscreen such as a newspaper headline words on a sign or on a computer monitor
should be set off in quotes

song titles in the description should also be enclosed in quotes

titles of books and publications should be underscored when they appear in the description

if an Action element describes something that occurs off-screen then the term “off-screen” should be
abbreviated as “os”

Example 4 Action Correct

EXT MCCARRAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT — CUSTOMS — NIGHT

Action 5

every character who is either essential to the script or who speaks must be introduced in CAPS and
given an age - exception if your lead character is a vampire a zombie or other undead and heshe is
not 527years old but rather the age of the actor that you envision in the role

abbreviations in ACTION for the background (bg) and foreground (fg) are written in lower case

the same applies to the abbreviation for point—of—view (pov) without sound (mos) voice-over
(vo) and off-screen (0s) when used in ACTION

Character

the name appears in ALL CAPS the first time a character is introduced in Action
Character 1

after the first appearance in action the characters name is written normally
Character 1

Note Character’s names are capitalized in Secondary Scene Headings

in a Secondary Scene Heading the character’s name would be written in CAPS
Character 1

in CHARACTER names always appear in ALL CAPS

Character 1

it’s not necessary to use both the first and last names - leads generally go by their first names but can

be last name
Character 1

unless the same actress is playing Peggy at 2 Peggy at 13 and Peggy at 33 you’ll need to distinguish
the characters for the director the casting agent the costumer props etc as well as the actors who
will be hired
to play the role “BABY PEGGY” “YOUNG PEGGY” and “PEGGY” are awkward but essential
differentiations

Character 2

animals do not need to be introduced with CAPS unless they have actual lines but you can

when a character’s name changes it’s customary to remind the reader of the original name by placing
it in parentheses - the very next time a speech is cued using the new name and all subsequent speeches
use the new name alone

Character 3
never use an anonymous character cue such as “A VOICE” - instead identify the character by name

TOC

even if the speech originates off-screen from a character who has not yet appeared - in some situations
this may spoil the surprise but all speeches must be assigned to an actor
Character 3

character cues with multiple names indicating the same line is being spoken simultaneously by more
than one character should have a slash () separating each name - keep the cue as short as possible and
don’t allow it to wrap - each cue must be limited to just one line Character 4

« if one-character addresses another by name epithet or title that name should be set off with a comma
Character 4

spell out numbers when they appear in dialogue Avoid using symbols and abbreviations in dialogue
This is partly a timing issue to preserve the page—per—minute estimate in screenplays

if a passage of dialogue includes some text that a character is reading out loud this should be indicated
with the word “reading” as a personal direction as a parenthetical - the text being read should be
enclosed within quotation marks

Character 5

if one-character interrupts another then end the first character’s speech with an M-dash (a space
followed by two hyphens) not with a period - do not add an M-dash to the start of the second
character’s speech

Character 5

when a character recites poetry or song lyrics enclose the lines in quotes - you may indicate the end of
a line of lyrics using a slash (“‘”’) - this is preferable to ending each line with a hard return as it does
not alter the dialogue margins - some writers choose to put a “” at the end of each line of lyrics - some
start a new line - some do both and some do neither - all of these are acceptable options Some put
lyrics in ALL CAPS

Character 6

an acronym such as FB I would be presented in dialogue as F — B — I omitting the periods and using
a hyphen flanked by spaces to separate each letter - this makes it clear that each letter should be
spoken

Character 7

never use bold or italics in dialogue - instead underscore the word or phrase you wish to emphasize -
there seems a trend of occasionally uses ALL CAPS in words in dialogue
Character 7

if the first character’s speech trails off then end that speech with an ellipsis () - if the second
character finishes the first character’s sentence then start the second character’s speech with an ellipsis

Dialogue

is the words spoken in a screenplay Dialogue is a conversation but not everyday life conversation Real
talk is boring It’s disjointed long-winded redundant repetitive unfocused and often littered with too
much information

Good dialogue is never about capturing the truth or reality of how we really talk Realistic dialogue only
gives a flavor of reality It’s artful deception Screenwriter’s dialogue must feel and sound believable
but the irony is that believable dialogue doesn’t exist in real talk

Good screenplay dialogue has a rhythm and therefore is easily spoken It’s compressed and moves
rapidly The verbal exchanges move back and forth shifting power between characters Screenplay
dialogue must be full of conflict And characters rarely say exactly what they mean Dialogue is all
about Subtext

Done properly good dialogue will move your story forward and flesh out your characters Subtext is
what’s really being conveyed by a character The meaning between the lines which is revealed by a
characters actions and reactions If the text is the words on the page the subtext is the content
understood by the reader as the story unfolds

Very simply this is what people say according to the script

Note If you don’t introduce a character in action first heshe doesn’t exist

Dialogue In Movies Has Four Major Functions
reveal character
advance the plot
create subtext
entertain
Details

Reveal Character

every line should resonate with the unique voice of each character

the flavor of each character’s background ought to be captured in their word choices

the syntax (arrangement of words) should be uniquely each character’s

focus on background attitudes personality quirks unique world view mannerisms education
wants and needs

main characters have needs which should come into conflict with the needs of other characters

Advance Plot

good dialogue advances the story - characters say something that leads to events happening
a character makes a choice

a character asks a question

information is subtley revealed

tension builds

even silence can be moving

a cause and effect is established between dialogue and what happens next

imparts conflict in a character’s interactions

TOC

in life inner conflict often gets externalized or “dropped” onto friends family or strangers

Create Subtext
avoid people saying precisely what they mean — be subtle
let visuals sounds tension and so on drive the meaning behind words -- trust your audience

Entertain

dialogue must evoke an emotional response and connect with an audience

whatever the line (funny poignant mysterious frightening or emotion-filled) the audience should be
moved emotionally

engage the reader or audience by connecting scenes late in the action or dialogue

exit every scene early

let characters to exist behind the scenes

reveal additional information about your characters (reveal the different or unexpected facets of their
personalities)

Questions To Answer In Dialogue

what is the purpose of the conversation

does it enhance an existing conflict

does it peak curiosity

does the conversation create tension

does the dialogue ramp up to a climax or a turn of events in the story or a change in the relationship of
the speakers

Types of Dialogue

Chit-ChatSmall Talk

is everyday direct small talk and simple question and answer conversation that in the real world starts up
a conversation A character asks a question Another character answers it This is POISON to your
script After a few boring lines of this the reader will conclude that you are not a screenwriter and toss
your script

Example 1 Chit-ChatSmall Talk Poor

ExpositionInformational

is dialogue needed to communicate about the setting backstory background information character
theme and any facts that are necessary to make sense of the story Keep to an ABSOLUTE MINIMUM
It’s used to advance the story Exposition can be presented as monologues Dialogues in-universe media
(newspapers letters reports journals etc) a protagonist’s thoughts or a narrator’s explanation of past
events It’s dialogue that the characters would know without saying Because people in real life have a
history They know information that doesn’t need to be resaid In a story it sounds artificial and quickly
takes one out of the story leading to boredom

Exposition 1

Mistakes With ExpositionInfor mational
Y you put most of the exposition in the first few pages of your script — getting the story off to a slow start

TOC

slow start It lessens the opportunity for interesting revelations and plot twists towards the end of your
screenplay

Y not having only enough exposition to understand the story up to that point Keep the audience in the
dark on things they don’t need to know Only release information as it is required Save your exposition
until important moments It keeps the story exciting

Y using flashbacks to deliver large blocks of boring backstory

e When Faced With The Need For ExpositionInformational
v Eliminate unnecessary exposition unless you can tell the story without it
v place exposition in scenes with conflict Arguments that starts on one thing can often escalate when past
issues come to the surface
¥ wait until the last moment to provide exposition — wait for the moment of maximum impact to reveal it
v keep it short - give us the necessary information so we can continue on with the story
Y use a character (main or supporting) whose job it is to deliver exposition a judge teacher military
officer principle politician scientist etc
Y try to pass information through visuals
Y if using flashback for exposition make sure
- the audience already cares about what will transpire in the future
- it motivates the character
- itll move the story forward
- it’s short and to the point
- it transitions well

Example 1 ExpositionInformational Poor

(people don’t talk like that — it slows the story flow — is boring — takes us out of the story)

Exposition is a necessary tool to understand the plot character setting andor theme It provides an

explanation of necessary background information to the audience

Exposition can be presented as monologues dialogues in-universe media (newspapers letters reports
journals etc) a protagonist’s thoughts or a narrator’s explanation of past events

On-The-NoseDirect

is dialogue in which characters say exactly what they’re feeling or what’s on their minds It is devoid of
nuance mystery ambiguity or surprise No one does this in real life (On-The-Nose Bad dialogue)
The subtext is written directly into the text It’s usually predictable because each person is on the same
topic and they get into a groove of speaking

On-The-Nose 1 On-The-Nose 2 On-The-Nose 3

Example 1 On-The-NoseDirect Poor
INT BAR - NIGHT

Jim elbows his way past the crush of drunk patrons to a vacated barstool Near closing Not much of a
selection A salty blond ALICE late side of 30’s drags on a cig

JIM

Alices causal nod toward the seat suggests she’s heard it all before Jim motions for the bartender

JIM

ALICE

JIM

ALICE

(BORING On-The-Nose dialogue is death to a script — no one wants to read this — it feels fake
and if the characters feel fake the script feels fake — what are we trying to accomplish — this is a
pickup — we know this from the beginning — we assume that Alice is also looking for the same —
eating up a lot of film time for what is ultimately boring and killing the script)

Example 2 On-The-NoseDirect Good

TOC

INT CLANCY’S BAR - NIGHT
Jim elbows his way past the crush of drunk patrons to a vacated barstool Near closing Not much of a
selection ALICE a salty blond on the late side of 30 drags on a cig

Jim motions for the bartender Alice puts a hand over her glass and hands Jim a parking validation Jim
smiles

(Not as boring without talking heads or much film time we’ve accomplished the task — always
eliminate anything boring — Alice appears more interesting — they both know the routine — they’ve
done this many times before — subtext without words)

Example 3 On-The-NoseDirect Poor —

JOHN

JUDY

JOHN

(people don’t talk like this because they’d never get what they want — if John spoke like this Judy
would hate him — it makes John look like an asshole — there is no mystery — it’s boring)

ObliqueIndirect

is dialogue where each person has their own agenda and is not usually interested in what the other
person is saying or they wish to divert the conversation in a different direction This is usually
unpredictable keeping the reader guessing is not informational compresses the story is interesting and
engaging Oblique 1 Oblique 2

Example 1 ObliqueIndirect Correct

JUDY

TOC

JOHN

JUDY

JOHN

(people often talk past each other — either because they don’t want to discuss a topic or they really
want to discuss their own topic — it engages the readeraudience because the characters are on the
verge of arguing)

Example 2 ObliqueIndirect Good

INT BAR — NIGHT
Bill turns his face away from the door as Julie walks in She goes straight to the bar where Bill sits

JULIE

BILL

(Bill doesnt answer the question — he circles around it and says something else — thats Oblique)

Subtext

is dialogue in which the messagethoughtsemotions are underneath the actual words something hidden
beneath or behind the words of what is being said The real meaning behind the words A character says
one thing but implies another is using subtext Subtext is what a character is really saying between the
lines and it is often revealed by a characters actions and reactions This engages the reader for this is
the world we really live in

¥ Subtext is often connected to strong emotions like love hatred jealousy desire anger frustration In

TOC

such cases hiding ones true feelings and thoughts is more the rule than the exception

¥ Subtext can penetrate deep create a mood grab hold of a readeraudience in a way no straightforward
declaration can do

¥ Subtext is what characters say without words It’s a feeling conveyed by a look the emotion behind
words unspoken It’s what moves characters to action

¥ Subtext is experienced by both readeraudience and character When subtext is introduced
readersaudiences are touched and engaged This is the world we really live in

Note Over 90 of all scripts have virtually no Subtext This usually sends them straight to the trash

Subtext 1 Subtext2 Subtext 3 Subtext4 Subtext5 Subtext 6 Subtext 7

A thread of subtext running through a story provides depth and richness It rises tension and conflict It’s

deeper more fundamental to a character’s traits or personality than is surface revelations The reader
must interpret what’s beneath the text which has the reader engage with the story deeper He might have
to accept that there’s more to a moment a scene an altercation or an exchange than what meets the eye
This acknowledgment of depth can keep a story from feeling flat and one-dimensional

Y Subtext ramps up readers’ emotions it can have them feeling sympathy for a clueless character

What Can Subtext Be Used For

tell readers something the characters don’t know

add tension and conflict

hidereveal political or religious messages

reveal a character’s real motivation or emotions

add depth to the story

everyone hides things - from others and from themselves

LLL LLL

what works well as motivation for subtext

- sexual attraction

- any topic characters don’t want to directly confront can be used for subtext Any topic that
reveals character andor motivation can be used for Subtext Any subject one character can use to
needle another character is perfect for subtext

Note An interesting point The more subtext a script has the better A good actor’s skills are needed to
pull it off For actors trying to be recognized excellent scripts with a lot of subtext (action and dialogue)
will let them shine

Example 1 Subtext Poor

DON CORLEONE

(speaks exactly what he means — no subtext — no mystery to the readeraudience)

Example 2 Subtext Good

DON CORLEONE

(with subtext — the meaning behind the words are powerful — the readeraudience is engaged and
wonders what he means)

with no awareness of the need to negotiate any other issue he can just state his intentions clearly —
of course Kathy will think he’s a dirtbag and will ridicule him on the spot — this “straight talk”
traumatizes both parties and real people don’t talk like this)

Example 5 Subtext Good
As her motions slip into the sensuous patrons’ voices go silent Everyone’s riveted on Alena’s dance
Gabriel appears mesmerized

As the MUSIC ends the band congratulates Alena The room APPLAUDS Alena settles down at
Gabriel’s table and wipes the sweat off her forehead

ALENA

Gabriel in a trance responds

GABRIEL

Alena smiles and grabs the drink menu She summons the waiter and orders two beers Gabriel gathers
his wits

(after Alena’s sensual dance Gabriel tells through subtext he wants to have sex with her — but if he
had said that Alena would have probably walked out and thought he was a dirtbag — by Gabriel
using subtext Alena is affirmed that she excites Gabriel — it reveals their character — Gabriel also

NORMAN

JULIE

TOC

NORMAN

(there’s much more to this exchange than what they’re actually saying — the shopping and beer are
not even the real topics — they serve as an excuse to rehash old problems yet they don’t provide a
forum for the characters to face and resolve those problems truly — thus the conflict — If we realize
the conversation is driven by the knowledge Norman has of an affair his wife is having — this
becomes a powerfully emotional scene)

Good dialogue is often Indirect or Subtext

Unique Voice Every character should have a unique voice As in life each character should have their
own distinct speaking style

Note A test for this in your script would be to write down all the dialogue each character on cards

and on the other side the character’s name and see if you can pick out each character only from the
dialogue Interesting people and interesting characters speak in subtext with unique voices

Example 1 Dialogue Correct

JEFF

(A character may always get straight to the point with minimum words)

Example 2 Dialogue Correct

(Another character may jabber on before getting to the point)

e Argument Is verbal conflict Conflict is great for your story Every character should give your
protagonist and other characters a hard time

Proprietor doesn’t know the stakes but we do - it’s for life and death — this drips of subtext - the
dialogue can last so long because of the suspense being generated)

Never Repeat Something We Already Know

Often we get story information in one scene and then in the very next scene one character tells another the

same information Never tell us things we already know
Example A character dies in one scene and another character must break the bad news All we need to
see is a relative crying Information transmitted solely for the audience’s benefit doesn’t belong in a
script

INT POLICE STATION - DAY
POLICE OFFICER sits across from Sam and throws down several photos of Bill’s dead body

movie and causes us to disengage since we don’t have to think)

INT POLICE STATION - DAY

body and rubs his hand

SAM

(we know he got the blisters from swinging the bat and we see Sam’s cool and has a sense of humor

Visuals Over Dialogue If you can “say” the same thing in an action line visual image action behavior or
sound effect instead of through dialogue omit the dialogue

Dramatic Irony

is irony that is inherent in dialogue or action and is understood by the readeraudience but isn’t grasped
by the characters in the film Or the irony occurring when the implications of a situation speech etc are
understood by the readeraudience but not by the characters in the film or refers to a situation where the
readeraudience has information that the characters don’t This normally leads to misunderstandings for
the characters while the reader waits for the truth to be revealed Dramatic irony achieves suspense by
giving the audience information often awareness of a threat that a character they are watching does not
have

Examples Of Dramatic Irony In Film

v In ‘There’s Something About Mary’ — Police questionTed about a murder but he thinks he’s
being questioned about picking up a hitchhiker

v In ‘Toy Story’ — Buzz thinks he’s a space ranger while the audience knows he’s a toy

v In ‘The Incredibles’ — Mr Incredible (a superhero) gets sued for saving a person attempting
suicide He also goes through a midlife crisis in the movie

v In ‘Groundhog Day’ — the audience and Phil know Groundhog Day is repeating but the other
people do not know this

v ‘A Beautiful Mind’ —a schizophrenic genius whose mind is both his greatest asset and his
greatest enemy Irony

v ‘The Lord of the Rings’ — The fate of the world rest in the hands of the smallest the meekest of
creatures Irony

v ‘Training Day’ — A top narcotics cop turns out to be the biggest crook of all Irony

v ‘Monsters Ball’ — A woman falls in love with a man not realizing hes responsible for executing
her late husband Irony Plus shes blackand hes a racist Double irony

Ways To Use Dramatic Irony

v Ratchet up the tension by allowing a character to make mistakes he wouldn’t make if he
saw the whole picture (From The Count of Monte Cristo the Count and his real son fight
with swords with likely death with neither knowing the truth about each other)

v Reveal a character’s real feelings by allowing them to speak their mind to someone they
don’t recognize (‘Batman’ would be an example of this or in Cyrano De Bergerac in which
Cyrano hides below in the bushes pretending to be the man Roxane loves and speaks words
from his heart)

v Create empathy by demonstrating a character’s vulnerability in situations they don’t fully
understand (In ‘Toy Story’ Buzz’s simple misinterpretation of his nature endears him to us

TOC

This also happens in horror movies when we know the killer hides in the very place a character
runs to for safety)

Incorporate humor (The scene described earlier in ‘There’s Something About Mary’
described above)

Grab the reader to keep turning pages to see the fireworks when an unknowing character
finds out the truth ‘Carrie’ uses dramatic irony this way The readeraudience knows Carrie is
going to be humiliated at the prom - keep following to find out what will happen when she learns
the truth In ‘The Hunger Games’ the readeraudience knows Katniss is unaware of Peeta’s
feelings for her are real and we eagerly wait to see how she will react when she finds out)

Be Careful When Creating Dramatic Irony

v

Don’t irritate the readeraudience by undercutting your character’s credibility Once the
audience knows something they will start to believe it’s obvious It’s difficult to be interested in
a character who overlooks anything obvious A character oblivious to the truth becomes
uninteresting

Don’t create fake humor by having your character act against reasoning just to keep the
dramatic irony alive This takes in thrillers or horror films when a victim runs up the stairs in
search of safety and the audience knows this is stupid Illogical characters oblivious to the
obvious can annoy people with humor where you don’t want it

Example 1 Dramatic Iron Excellent

DETECTIVE FRANEK
Okay calm down Ted we believe you
(beat)
The problem is we found your friend in the car

As Ted sits back down the Detectives just stare at him Finally Ted thinks he gets it

TED
Oh The hitchhiker

DETECTIVE CAVALLO
Well uh can you tell us his name

TED
Jeez I didnt catch it

The Detectives flinch at his glib demeanor

DETECTIVE FRANEK
So he was a stranger It was totally random

TED
(confused)
He was the first hitcher I saw what can I tell
you Now cut to the chase how much trouble am I in

(Ted begins to confess to multiple murders thinking he’s admitting to picking up hitchhikers — a
total misunderstanding of people talking past each other)

How To Develop An Ironic Premise

Work in extremes Develop a leading character who represents the ultimate version of some characteristic
Hes the worlds worst (fill in the blank) Shes the worlds best (fill in the blank) He has the most (fill in the
blank) She has the least (fill in the blank) Of course your characters may not really be the worlds best
worstbiggestsmallestfirstlast anything but this exercise is bound to point you in the right direction

Put extreme characters in direct conflict The best with the worst The fearful with the fearless The prince
with the pauper The militant feminist with a male chauvinist pig Not only do such conflicts present
immediate dramatic possibilities (ie conflict) they also give each character the pressure he or she needs to

grow

Call it a twist a gimmick or a High-Concept It is the element of irony that propels most if not all
successful stories

Shut Characters Up Movies are visual art Try to accomplish what is spoken with visual action Too many
characters are just talking heads
Why Movies have approximately 2 hours to tell an exciting story This leaves little time for characters
to have long stretches of dialogue Also short punchy dialogue keeps the readeraudience engaged

Dialogue In Subtext Too many character’s words are On-The-Nose Chit-Chat and not enough deeper
Subtext
Why Subtext draws the readeraudience into the story because they are engaged at interpreting the
meaning of the subtext and drawn in by the original dialogue It makes the readeraudience an active
participant in the story

Delete All Unnecessary Words Usually less is better and clearer Use as few words as possible with lots
of meaning
Why Usually fewer words are clearer People can’t keep long blocks of words in their heads Also
many writers add poorly chosen adverbs and adjectives tagged to weak verbs and nouns They can
usually be removed and stronger verbs and nouns put in their place

TOC

Move The Story Forward Every scene should have a point It should be moving the plot along in some
way If a problem is introduced into your story and a scene goes by without the characters attempting to
address that problem guess what You’re not moving your story forward
Why No scene should exist just to fill space or time Each scene must move the story closer to a
resolution Many times writers write in scenes that are entirely incongruent with anything related to the
story

Use Contractions People speak mostly in contractions Replace all possible words with contractions
Why That’s how people speak It sounds natural

Know Your Characters each character has their own personality their own values their own aspirations
and their own failings Find what these are and always keep your characters true to who they are
Why Few things are worse than a character acting out of character It causes the readeraudience to put
the brakes on investing in the story

Keep It Short In general no long speeches Keep dialogue short
Why People have a short attention span Your words are clearer and have more impact if they get
straight to the point and don’t wander Every extra word that’s not vital at getting your point across is a
reason for the readeraudience to disengage

Write In Present Tense screenplays are written in the NOW - Present Tense
Why It’s a rule that every screenwriter must follow Plus your story is taking place in the NOW
which is written with Active Voice and Present Tense

Use Simple Informative Words avoid adjectives and adverbs
Why Use of adjectives and adverbs are signs that you didn’t choose the correct verb or noun Again
weak word-choice gives the readeraudience a chance to disengage This applies to both dialogue and
action

No Dialect Or Foreign Accent indicate that in parenthesis
Why That’s the actor and director’s job at how the character to sound Just write powerful clear
English which the actor will then use his skills to make the character come alive

Underwriting Or Overwriting without enough information the readeraudience has a confusing fuzzy
picture of what’s occurring Too much information and the readeraudience becomes bored
Why Your dialogue should contain enough information to peek the readeraudience’s interest or
enough for the readeraudience to have a clear picture in their head of what’s taking place But no long
flowery monologues that add nothing to the story Either will annoy the readeraudience

Entertain this is the scariest part of all when it comes to dialogue After you do all that stuff — the story
the exposition the characters the minimizing — the dialogue still has to entertain us It still has to sound like
two people talking in real life

Why Ultimately it’s about entertaining the readeraudience Everything else doesn’t count if your story

TOC

doesn’t entertain

Reveal Character you want to use your dialogue to tell us more about your characters Screenplays are
short One of the big ways to reveal character through dialogue is to identify your character’s fatal flaw and
keep bringing it up throughout the script
Why How a character speaks and what he says can add depth to your story by revealing the true nature
of a character

Move The Story Forward every scene should have a point It should be moving the plot along in some
way If a problem is introduced into your story and a scene goes by without the characters attempting to
address that problem guess what You’re not moving your story forward

Why Dialogue needs to advance the story else it shouldn’t be there

Know Your Characters none of us sees the world the same way Our world view is colored by our past
our experiences our education our decisions etc - and the meaning we gave to everything that happened to
us And our behaviors actions and words are in line with our view of life So because of this we also
speak both differently from each other and with conformity with our beliefs
Why Once we know a character they should not out of left field speak in ways that disagree with our
understanding of who these people are otherwise the readeraudience will be annoyed and might
disengage because our character is no longer believable (eg Dirty Harry would never apologize)

Bad Dialogue

Avoid The Stereotypical we’ve heard it before the macho man spouting off with words we’ve heard
before or the helpless woman speaking in well-worn phrases as a victim
Why Stereotypical dialogue is boring and disengages The readeraudience is looking for Dialogue that
turns expectations of what the character will say on their head

Avoid On-The-Nose Dialogue is when characters say exactly what they’ re feeling or what’s on their
minds See On-The-Nose
Why Bad dialogue On-The-Nose dialogue People don’t talk like this It doesn’t advance the story
It’s boring

Avoid Trite Overused and consequently of little import lacking originality or freshness
Why Filler words and phrases just to fill up space will annoy the readeraudience

Avoid Slang The continual and ever-changing use and definition of words in informal conversation
Why Slang will date your movie It also quickly becomes cliché and sounds old

Examples ’Slang Representations’

Avoid Truisms a statement that is obviously true and says nothing new or interesting
(eg ‘Opposites attract’ ‘The apple never falls far from the tree’ “What goes around comes around’)
Why Commonplace cliché like statements disengages the readeraudience Replace these with sharp

TOC

original Dialogue

Avoid Clichés The first versions of a screenplay are often filled with clichés thus the value of rewrites

Why Clichés causes the readeraudience to temporarily stop thinking because they have seen or heard it
before Too many of these moments and your script will be discarded

Avoid Dialogue Cues do not over instruct the actor

Why Telling the actor in parentheticals what to do or excessive beats is annoying to the reader and the
actor who might read your script later

Don’t Tell What the Audience Can See Never repeat

Why A more powerful and emotional experience is from our visual senses To point out what we are
looking at in dialogue is both redundant and annoying

Avoid Exposition exposition is the worst It’s hard enough to make dialogue sound good on its own Now

v

v

we must waste it on logistical story elements

eliminate exposition that isn’t absolutely necessary or that will become clear as the story moves
forward

deliver exposition in scenes that contain conflict An argument that starts about one thing often escalates
when past issues are brought into the mix

wait as long as possible before providing exposition always looking for the moment of maximum
dramatic impact to reveal it

use brevity Exposition doesn’t have to be a monologue Just give us the necessary information so we
can move forward

use a character (main or supporting) whose job it is to deliver exposition a judge teacher military
officer principle politician scientist etc

Why Exposition to describe information is needed for the story to make sense It feels artificial

Parenthetical
always lives inside parenthesis and on their own line directly below CHARACTER If they hit their
right margin they wrap around to the next line

Note use sparingly — actor’s hate being told how to say lines

Types of Parentheticals
1 Performance
How to react emotionally to what’s being said To be used ONLY if how to play or say the words It
should only be used if the words are to be performed very differently than could be reasonably expected
to be interpreted by the actor Read contrary to logic

2 Action
Is an action done by the SPEAKING character while speaking

3 Language

TOC

v Let’s the reader know that another language dialect or accent is being spoken
Language - character speaking in this language
Dialect - character is speaking in a language with a specific dialect (grammar) and represents a
variation of a language spoken in a particular area or region
Accent - refers to the way a person sounds or how they pronounce particular words

4 Pause
Indicates a pause in dialogue usually represented by (beat)

5 Speaking
Clarifies who is being spoken to

A Parenthetical Remark Can Be

v attitudeperformance Parenthetical1 Parenthetical 2
v verbal direction Parenthetical 2

v action direction for character speaking Parenthetical 9

v change in language for the actor who is speaking Parenthetical 5

v should be short and to the point Parenthetical 1

v descriptive Parenthetical 6

v only used when absolutely necessary

v are not sentences — no period at end Parenthetical 1-3

v no CAPITAL for first word unless first Parenthetical 1-3

word requires Capital

Note Caution Parentheticals take up space slow your pace and annoy actors who don’t like being
told how to say their lines only use parentheticals if not using them leads to confusion

Example 1 Parenthetical Good

Scene Heading

An event that takes place entirely in one location or time If we go outside from inside its a new
scene If we cut to five minutes later its a new scene If both its a new scene Scenes can range from
one shot to infinity and are distinguished by Scene Headings Secondary Scene Headings

Scene Headings mark any change in location or time in your screenplay Every scene begins with a
Scene Heading Secondary Scene Headings take place within a sub-location of the master Scene
Heading location

A Scene Heading is one line of text in a screenplay that comes before the description (Action Line) of a
scene It gives the content for the whole scene

It is as if everything that happens in the whole scene — what is seen what is heard and where it all
happens — is filmed in a single continuous shot A Scene Heading consists of 3 parts

1 Camera location

2 Scene location

3 Time

Camera Location

1 INT (for interior) — the scene takes place inside a structure with a roof

EXT (for exterior) — the scene takes place outside a structure and has no roof

INTEXT or EXTINT or INTEXT or EXTINT — the scene takes place both inside and outside
a structure The first term tells where the scene starts

TOC

Why It tells the production crew if they will be shooting on stage or location (lighting and sound) It
affects the budget

Scene Location

It is where the scene physically takes place

v You should use the minimum number of words (1-4) to describe it Do not include specific
details of the location in the master Scene Heading

v Put the proper name of a location in your Scene Heading in quotes

Why The longer the scene location the more confusing the flow of the story

Time
It comes last and is preceded by a dash

It can be either DAY or NIGHT Writers seem intent on adding to this DAWN SUNRISE MORNING
AFTERNOON EVENING SUNSET LATER MOMENTS LATER CONTINUOUS SAME

v If the scene takes place in space there is no DAY or NIGHT Leave off time element unless the
scene takes place inside a structure then you can use DAY

v Use LATER or MOMENTS LATER when the scene shortly follows another and both take place
in the same location

Why Night scenes are more expensive (budget) — they require more lighting and night rates for the
crew

Scene Heading
° Scene headings are numbered only in shooting scripts so as to provide a reference for production
personnel Do not number the scenes in a screenplay intended for submission

° Do not BOLD or underscore scene headings

e Always use complete scene headings beginning with the abbreviation Do not spell out
“EXTERIOR” or “INTERIOR” When cutting to a different time in the same location “INT” or
“EXT” is still required

e “INT” and “EXT” are abbreviations They should end in a period

e Where the scene heading prefix “INT” or “EXT” is concerned screenplay format calls for only
one space not two after the period

° When the scene is immediately followed by an action that takes place in the same location but
later in the day a new scene heading is needed

TOC

If the intention is to move the camera from interior to exterior or vice versa in a single
uninterrupted shot this may be noted in the scene heading Denoted as “INTEXT” or
“EXTINT”

“INT” and “EXT” are abbreviations for Interior and Exterior As such they must each end in a
period Scene Heading 1

The exception is when they are joined together as ‘INTEXT’ Though I’ve seen many written
as ‘INTEXT’ or ‘EXTINT” which is also acceptable Scene Heading 2

Only these four choices may be used to describe in what type of location a scene occurs ‘INT’
(occurs inside) ‘EXT’ (occurs outside) ‘INTEXT’ (occurs both inside and outside)
‘EXTINT’ (occurs both inside and outside)

With ‘INT’ or ‘EXT’ standard screenplay format calls for only one space not two after the
period

It’s customary to separate the elements in a Scene Heading with a single dash (or hyphen)
flanked by single spaces Scene Heading 3

If some action takes place in the same setting as the one preceding it only later in the day its
necessary to break out the new scene with its own heading It’s not enough to just insert the
Secondary Scene Heading line “LATER” This new heading must include a time of day (but
there is plenty of exceptions these days where only LATER is used) Scene Heading 4

A new Scene Heading is also needed whenever we cut from one interior setting to another (eg
one room to another) and when we cut to a different spot outside the line of sight in the same

exterior setting See Secondary Scene Heading

Only two acceptable times of day ‘DAY’ and ‘NIGHT’ Unacceptable times include ‘THE
NEXT DAY’ ‘LATER THAT MORNING’ and ‘THAT SAME MOMENT’ No matter when
one scene takes place relative to another all that’s evident on-screen is whether it’s day or night

A time—of—day modifier such as ‘DAWN’ ‘DUSK’ and ‘LATER’ may be added if necessary
in parentheses (it appears to be acceptable to put modifiers by themselves) Scene Heading 5

The modifier ‘LATER’ is used only when a scene takes place in the very same location as the
previous one In such cases the headings would be identical were it not for the modifier Adding
it avoids confusion as to why both scenes could not be merged into one Scene Heading 5

One of the more common mistakes is to use the term ‘CONTINUOUS’ as a time of day This is
redundant for unless the master location changes we may assume each successive scene is part

TOC
of a continuous sequence Don’t use ‘CONTINUOUS’ as a time of day

If it’s important to note the locale (such as a city) in the Scene Heading so as to avoid confusion
then a modifier may be added in parentheses Scene Heading 6

When adding the locale to a Scene Heading it’s needed only in the first instance Once the locale
of a particular setting has been established no need to remind us again Scene Heading 6

A specific place or room should be separated from the master setting in which it resides by a
slash Scene Heading 5

It is also acceptable to separate the specific setting from the master with a hyphen However a
slash is preferred as it keeps the setting grouped making it easier to distinguish from other
elements in the heading

The master setting comes first Whenever we cut from an exterior to an interior or vice versa we
must include the master setting (eg it can’t just be ‘BILL’S OFFICE’ It must be
“HOUSEBILL’S OFFICE’)

The master scene-setting need not be repeated in subsequent Scene Headings if those scenes
occur as part of an uninterrupted sequence To continue from the above example if we follow a
character from the living room of the apartment to the kitchen we need a new Scene Heading

Scene Heading 7

Enclose the proper name for an establishment or a vehicle within quotes Scene Heading 8

Whenever the Action moves from interior to exterior (or vice versa) a new Scene Heading is
required This heading must include a time of day The exception is when the camera tracks with
the characters in which case the term ’ —- TRACKING’ should be appended to the scene
heading Scene Heading 9 (don’t use tracking in a Spec Script)

If the intention is to move the camera from interior to exterior (or vice versa) in a single
uninterrupted shot this may be noted in the Scene Heading The correct prefix is ‘INTEXT’
with no period before the slash But these days INT EXT is also accepted This is often a
tracking shot If so it should also be designated as such in the Scene Heading

Scene Heading 9

A slash cannot be used to designate multiple locations Each change of location must have a
separate Scene Heading Scene Heading 10

The heading for a scene that takes place inside a moving vehicle should have the word
‘TRAVELING’ or ‘MOVING’ appended to it separated from the time—of—day by a dash

Scene Heading 11

TOC

Dates and transitional information such as ‘THREE WEEKS LATER’ should not appear in a
Scene Heading If it’s vital that the audience know the date or the exact period of time that has
passed then it may be conveyed by means of a legend (ie SUPER)

If the time period helps to define the setting then enclose it in parentheses as part of the master
Scene Heading Scene Heading 12

Indicate a scene is stock footage with a dash and the word ‘STOCK’ in parentheses at the end of
the heading

Be consistent with Scene Headings If the setting is ‘ALENA’S BEDROOM’ in one scene for
example don’t make it just ‘BEDROOM’ in another

If another scene in the script takes place in the same location keep the location name the same in
every instance

If the setting has a proper name as in the case of a restaurant or a ship it should be enclosed
within quotes

Scene Headings are numbered only in shooting scripts so as to provide a reference for
production personnel They are never numbered in a Spec Script they only clutter the page and
distract the reader

Do not bold or underscore Scene Headings

Triple—space (making two blank lines) before each Scene Heading It’s acceptable to double—
space but triple spacing is standard It separates the scenes more distinctly Double-space (one
blank line) between the heading and the action or description that follows it

In Outer Space there is no need to attach a time to the Screen Header Time only applies on a
planet that revolves around a star

Scene Heading 13

Keep location wording to the minimum needed to orient the reader — ideally one to four words

For TIME use only these DAY NIGHT or these modifiers
DAY means the sun is out (normal)

NIGHT means the sun is not out (normal)

MORNING means early in the day

EVENING means the end of the day

DAWN meaning sunrise

DUSK meaning sunset

TOC

LATE NIGHT meaning late at night
EARLY MORNING meaning early in the morning
LATER means the same location but later in time

e Everything in the Scene Heading is CAPITALIZED
Scene Heading 14

° The Scene Heading is always followed by an action line and never by character or dialogue
Action line or character always follows an action line
Scene Heading 14 Scene Heading 15

Example 1 Scene Heading Good

(cannot transition from car to garage to the house without having a new Scene Heading separating

them Alena gets out of the car in the Garage then exits the Garage and runs inside the House —
each different location needs a Screen Heading)

Secondary Scene Heading

If an entire scene is viewed from a particular character’s perspective this can be indicated by means of a
separate scene heading appended with the modifier “SUBJECTIVE CAMERA”

Secondary Scene Heading 8 (don’t use Subjective Camera in Spec Script)

(eg INT DINING ROOM — DAY — SUBJECTIVE CAMERA)

Point—of—view shots and subjective Camera Shots are usually reserved only for the principal characters as

Example 2 Secondary Scene Heading Correct
INT CLASSROOM — DAY

Jim jumps on the table and whips out his cellphone

Jim does a backflip to the floor and rushes out of the room
(screenwriters often use Secondary Scene Headings in place of SHOT or INSERT)

Secondary Scene Heading is used to break up and refocus a longer scene or to point out an important
detail or new element They have a blank line below and above it

As used here a Secondary Scene Heading is different from a Scene Heading They direct our attention to
whats important within a scene They add punch and can be used to heighten the pacing They can become
annoying if used excessively (use sparingly)

Secondary Scene Headings cannot be used to change the location or the time of day but can change a sub-
location within a master heading (eg a room within the master-location house) It’s possible to bridge a
small gap in time within a scene by using a Secondary Scene Heading but it must focus on some character

TOC
detail or sub-location

Secondary Scene Headings are written in ALL CAPS and it may consist of just the character or characters
we see in the shot

Each Secondary Scene Heading is its own element Action or Description cannot appear next to it on the
same line but must follow the Secondary Scene Heading in a new paragraph

Scene Headings usually have two blank lines above them Secondary Scene Headings always have just one

When breaking up a scene with Secondary Scene Headings each should draw our attention to detail or a
character within a scene Secondary Scene Heading 3

One type of Secondary Scene Heading is an INSERT a detail shot in which no recognizable actor appears
As with all Secondary Scene Headings an insert is written in ALL CAPS It must also reference the detail
within the Secondary Scene Heading Secondary Scene Heading 9

The use of split-screen (often designated by means of a Secondary Scene Heading) should be left to the
discretion of the director A split-screen in a script often just leads to confusion especially when the
Secondary Scene Headings refer to the left or right scene instead of a setting

Many screenwriters use Secondary Scene Headings in place of SHOT or INSERT (eg if Sally receives a
text message that we read it may be set off with the Secondary Scene Heading “ON HER PHONE
SCREEN” before the message content and a “BACK TO SCENE” after)

Camera Shots written as a Secondary Scene Heading such as “REVERSE SHOT” are usually unneeded
Even close-ups are to be avoided unless they reveal some detail that is vital to the story Camera Shots
should not be used in a Spec Script Secondary Scene Heading 1

It’s possible to bridge a small gap in time within a scene through the use of a Secondary Scene Heading but
it must focus on some character or detail It’s not enough to simply write LATER
Note Dialogue never follows a Secondary Scene Heading NEVER Action always separates the two

If we wish to cut to a character named JOHN breaking across a football field for example we’d insert
JOHN as a Secondary Scene Headings

When a Camera Shot originates from a particular character’s point—of—view you should break it out with its
own Secondary Scene Heading This Secondary Scene Heading must state the character by name and refer
to what the character sees It’s not enough to simply write “JOHN’ POV” (ie using periods because it’s
an abbreviation) without also specifying in the Secondary Scene Heading what John sees Secondary

Scene Heading 2

After describing a pov shot we usually return to the scene (to get the character’s reaction) employing the

Secondary Scene Heading “BACK TO SCENE” Secondary Scene Heading 2
Example 3 Secondary Scene Heading Correct
INT PENTHOUSEFOYER — DAY

Bryan races toward the opening

He swings open the fridge and grabs a soda As he takes a swig he moves to

On the table sits the key which he grabs

(once the Master Scene Heading has been established you can use Secondary Scene Headings to
identify sub-locations within the same master location For sub-locations you can exclude INTEXT
as well as DAYNIGHT since these have already been established Secondary Scene Headings take
place with no time delay)

(INSERTS are a form of Secondary Scene Heading that focuses attention on an object)
‘Courage’

Transitions
are how one scene Transitions to another scene Used appropriately these can be used to convey shifts
in character development and emotion

A ‘CUT TO is not required at every scene change Some major transitions include CUT TO
DISSOLVE TO MATCH CUT TO JUMP CUT TO SMASH CUT TO WIPE TO and FADE TO
Each term has its own entry in this list of terms Occasionally a writer will make up his own Transition
In these cases the Transition is usually self-defined

(eg BRIGHT WHITE FLASH TO suggests whiteness will fill the screen for a brief moment as we
pass into the next scene)

Note This is in the realm of the director The screenwriter is to tell the best story they can Rewrite
Transitions in Spec Scripts so the reading flows better and the transitions except FADE IN and FADE
OUT (traditional) are removed)

Whenever there is a jump in time andor space we may bridge the gap by means of a Transitional
instruction The Transitions used most often are “FADE IN” “ FADE OUT” and “DISSOLVE TO” A
common way to lead into a dream sequence for example is with the Transitional instruction “RIPPLE

TOC

DISSOLVE TO” Some other Transitions include “WIPE TO” “IRIS IN” and “IRIS OUT” but these
are considered old-fashioned and rarely used

Each transitional instruction such as “DISSOLVE TO” should appear at its own margin The standard
indention is 60 inches from the left edge of the page In other words the Transition would begin 25
inches from the right edge (on paper 85 inches wide) It’s also acceptable for a Transition to be right-
justified at the right margin

The exception to this rule is any transition that ends with “IN” (eg “FADE IN” must be placed at the
left Action margin)

Every Transitional instruction must end with a colon The exception is any Transition that ends with
“OUT” For example “FADE OUT” ends in a period

Chapter 2 Story Concepts
Conflict

Writing a screenplay is telling a story about an interesting character who wants something badly and is
having trouble getting it Conflict drives a story

It’s important to accomplish maximum emotional impact and audience connection while reaching a
satisfactory ending not necessarily a happy one

Three essential elements of creating a great story are

1) CHARACTER Your story must be about an interesting character with whom we have some
empathy It helps if the character is also likable and sympathetic but empathy is key for the
readeraudience to identify

2) WANT This character wants something extremely badly and it should be a matter of life and
death The stakes are high there is no other option but to pursue the want

3) CONFLICT Create obstacles making this goal incredibly difficult which forces the character
into a greater commitment and more desperate ways to overcome each conflict while making it
still possible to achieve the goal

For Conflict

° Characters Must Have Clear Goals
Conflict stems from different people different groups different forces different anything
wanting different things - or sometimes the same person torn between different things If you
don’t know what your characters want it’ll be hard to wring any conflict out of them at all let
alone an interesting story The things your characters are striving for seeking wanting going
after is the lifeblood of your story Clearly define the different character goals place them in
opposition to each other and the plot almost takes care of itself This may be as simple as asking
what does my character want A new job to save the world the death of an enemy

° No Detail Is Too Small Or Too Big
Ask every character what they want RIGHT NOW This is a wonderful way to pack a story
with conflict You’ve already set a story-level goal so now look at your characters from different
levels What do they want out of every scene What do they want out of every interaction What
do they want with every line of dialogue Why are they saying these exact words at this exact
time Have an objective Then look at each character’s overall goals After the story ends where
are the characters headed What do they value out of life All these wants and desires large and
small near and far interact with and build on each other to help you create a story that’s always
moving forward because it’s bursting with conflict and a story that always works because it’s
being driven by characters seeking out clearly defined goals

e Characters Fail

TOC

If a character gets what they want too easily you don’t have a story anymore Nothing anyone
will want to see While we all want success from life watching a character immediately succeed
doesn’t make for gripping entertainment Watching them fail get up and try again and again and
again does Think about our failures in life It’s how we learn It’ show we get better That can
work for your characters too Maybe the first time a character goes up against the antagonist
heshe’s crushed What do you think will happen the next time Keep in mind characters don’t
have to fail at just the big things in your story They can fail at little things also especially if
those little things tie back to the big things

(eg Maybe a character who wants a new job has a lot of trouble getting to the interview on time
(alarm doesn’t go off they miss the bus the building is on fire when they get there etc) Or
perhaps a character getting ready for a big presentation breaks the coffee maker and has to go on
without a hit of caffeine and so on and so on Failure is ripe for conflict Use it)

Opinionated Characters

What is a huge source of real-life conflict between strangers and friends alike Opinions About
everything Maybe it sounds obvious but too often we see stories where we have no idea what
the character really thinks about anything Sure if you’ve managed to give them clear story
goals we probably get their values - they’re for good and not evil they’re moral and forthright
or dishonest and corrupt or whatever That doesn’t tell us much about what they believe though
at least when it comes to the complexities of life

(eg Maybe your character is a Republican and his wife is a Democrat This is a real-world
scenario that’s played out on cable news every election night for years you can mine for endless
conflict But I think you can do even better (and maybe less clichéd) just by taking some time to
let the audience know your character’s thoughts about the things in their world When they come
up against someone who has different thoughts about the same things BOOM Instant conflict
instant drama)

Effective Exposition

Watching two people agree in a story is boring watching two people agree about some piece of
exposition you’ve had to stop the plot to give is even worse Most stories can’t make it without at
least a little bit of exposition Genre stories like science fiction or fantasy often require a lot But
here’s a trick that will help infuse your story with conflict and make your exposition so much
more interesting all at the same time if one person has to explain something have the person
listening disagree or question It’s more fun than hearing a character spout off information
without any rebuttal Instead try another character say “I don’t get it” or “I can’t believe that’s
true” or “I totally disagree”

Note Moral Dilemma — arises out of a situational conflict in which obeying one would result in
transgressing another

(eg if we accept that it is morally correct to never torture a living creature and that it is morally
correct to save a human’s life if you have the ability to do so how do you decide what to do if
you can only save a human’s life by torturing someone else)

TOC

Creating a Moral Dilemma will draw the readeraudience emotionally deeper into the drama if
empathy is created for the character first

Brad LAUGHS

Can you prove you didn’t offer to save my job if I’d
let you blow me

Brad leans back in his chair studying Lester

BRAD
Man You are one twisted fuck

LESTER
(standing)
Nope I’m just an ordinary guy with nothing to lose

(now that’s conflict - Lester feels he has nothing to lose so he goes all out Brad evaluates the
ramifications on his career if he calls what he might think of as impossible)

Genre
The Action world is full of memorable one-liners Gangster films have sinister mobsters and ruthless
hoodlums Dramas are all about serious realism while screwball comedies can get away with fart

TOC

jokes Adventure films have exotic locales but if you’re writing a western you better have dusty towns
and six-shooters Science fiction scores with aliens and futuristic technology And when it comes to
slasher films don’t hold back — the audience is rooting for the killer

Understanding film genres (and sub-genres) is essential because people rarely go to the movies to be
surprised They know the action hero will survive that the girl will get the guy and the villains will get
screwed Nobody goes to a rom-com to face reality

The truth is that love is hell and sometimes the bad guys win but in the movies love is a holy elixir
and the hero always saves the day Screenwriting is not about reinventing the wheel The key to writing
a sellable script is to understand the genre and meet the expectations of its audience

Mystery

is the presence that is not present — the hidden catalyst or inexplicable disturbance that forces choice and
action As a mystery it stands within behind and beyond the goals and plans of every dramatic
character It is both secret and a puzzle as well as the source of the audience’s most important questions
and doubts concerning the identity of the characters their back-stories and their present situation When
an audience is alert to the possibility that a character’s actions might hide more than they reveal when

99 66

questions concerning “what” “why” and “who” give rise to an uneasiness that provokes uncertainty and

increasing anxiety you can be sure that mystery is afoot

Mystery hides information from the readeraudience to make it ask “how come” Suspense hides or
withholds information from the characters to make the audience wonder “what now”

Creating Mystery

Your Story Must Be An Incomplete Equation

A complete equation is 1 2 3 It’s simple Clean And it’s already resolved Stories are not simple
They are not clean And we most certainly don’t want to read stories that have already been resolved
We read stories that evolve and evade as we read them Their uncertainty feels present — though we
know the story will finish by its end a good story lets us — or demands that we — forget that A good
story traps us in the moment and compels us by its incompleteness The equation then becomes X 2
3 and we are driven to solve for X It is the X that haunts us It is the emptiness of that variable we hope
to fill Incomplete equations

Every Story Is A Mystery

This isn’t a list of murder mysteries This is a list of every story out there All stories need unanswered
questions All stories demand mysteries to engage our desperate need to know We flip the little
obsessive dip switches in the circuit boards of our reader’s mind by presenting enigmas and perplexities
Why is our lead character so damaged What’s in the strange magical rock How will they escape the
pack of ninja Zombies Storytelling is in many ways the act of posing questions and then exploring the
permutations of those questions before finally giving in and providing answers

Your Story Is The Opposite Of The News

TOC

A news story is upfront Tells the facts “Man Stranded On Mars” “Child Eaten By Pet Goldfish” A
journalist is tasked to answer the cardinal questions (the five W’s and the one H) who what where
when why and how As a storyteller you make the readeraudience ask these questions and then
you choose not to answer them all Oh you answer some of them But one or two remain open
empty Unanswered variables

Mysteries Must Affect Characters

Not every mystery is a worthy one Not every question deserves to be answered How do you know
Well You never really know but a good test is finding out what mysteries engage your characters — if
it’s a mystery the characters care about and the audience cares about the characters by proxy they will
care about the mystery at hand also Therefore arbitrary mysteries — those that exist for their own sake
and no other — fail Mysteries are anchored to character motivation They affect possible outcomes

The Power Of Mystery Compels Us

A good mystery is a meteor that punches a hole in that once-complete equation we were talking about
Many stories thrive on One Big Question (think What Is The Matrix Why Are These Transformers
So Racist) and that’s okay because sometimes that’s a hole the audience wants to fall into But
know that such a mystery is not enough You still need a cogent plot strong characters and a
unifying theme to serve as a through-line

A Sprinkling Of Small Mysteries

Instead of one big mystery consider instead (or in addition) a series of smaller mysteries little mini-arcs
that rise on the question mark and fall toward the answer A character needs to remember a location on
the map but can’t (where is it and what will she do if she cannot find it) Someone has taken her
morning newspaper (who and why)

Sometimes You Need An Incorrect Answer
Sometimes creating mystery is not an act of asking a question but the deed of providing a clearly
incorrect answer Let the audience seek the truth by showing them a lie

Leaving Out Some Answers

The readeraudience wants to be engaged They want to bring themselves into the equation They want
to help you fill in the blanks because that is human nature When you leave pieces out of the story the
readeraudience will try to fill in the blanks And once you do that you’ve engaged your audience

It Leads To The Protagonist’s Demise Or Sets Up Victory

A mystery must have stakes — we must know why it exists and what it means for it to go unanswered
Tying in conditions of consequence to unsolved mysteries is critical — if the character doesn’t find her
keys she can’t get to the canyon if she can’t get to the canyon she won’t learn the identity of the person
who saved her from the vampire if she can’t uncover the person’s identity she won’t learn why she’s
being hunted by the vampire The audience must feel that the mystery has weight and meaning and

a vampire

TOC

Exposition Did It

Defined spaces become dull for the audience The audience must not be left comfortable They should
be forced to stare at those dark corners for as long as they can stand it The light of exposition expels the
shadows of mystery

Withhold Information As Long As Possible
Withholding information about the plot or the characters you create a deeper satisfaction upon finally
answering the mystery

The Longer The Mystery Persists The More Satisfying The Answer
The longer you let a mystery hang out there the more satisfying the mystery — and its resolution —
must be

Plot And Character Joined

Mysteries are often tied to plot or character Ideally mysteries are wound through plot and character A
murder mystery operates best when the death is linked to the characters at hand (nothing is less
satisfying than the murderer revealed as some person we’ve never met)

Entanglement Between Question And Conflict

Conflict and mystery go hand in hand The very nature of conflict offers a situation whose outcome is in
flux — we do not know what will happen and so conflict is emblazoned by a big question mark
Conflicts that are easily resolved are like mysteries that are easily resolved (they take the excitement out
of the story)

Narrative Rearranging

You can create mystery by breaking the traditional narrative flow and pulling apart the pieces then
rearranging them in whatever order gives you maximum mystery and maximum payoff If we see part of
the ending at the beginning we glimpse changed circumstances and seek to unravel the complex knot
you just dropped in our lap If we come in toward the middle we want to know what got us

here and where we’re going Part of storytelling is the tension and recoil release of question versus
answer and changing the flow of the narrative can do a great deal toward tightening the questions and
super-charging the revelation of the answers

Cagey Characters

Characters can be cagey and that — thankfully blessedly — creates a mystery for readers

Characters do not make the right decisions all the time Nor should they A character fails to tell others
the truth about what’s going on A character who obfuscates or lies A character who tries to cover
something up All this goes a long way toward creating mystery in the audience

The Labyrinth At The Core Of The Human Heart
The greatest mysteries lurk at the center of human experience inside the emotional tangle where our
worst inclinations lives Seriously though a character’s motivations and fears (and you as the author

TOC

guarding those elements or at least withholding some components of them) provide the most profound
payoff in terms of offering and then answering mysteries Each character should be a mystery — not a
cipher not an endless unsolvable puzzle — but rather a question to be answered Don’t tell us
everything Hold back

Creating Mystery In The Edit

Maybe your first draft doesn’t have enough mysterious plasm for you and the readers Grab a block of
action or dialogue Yank it out If the whole thing still makes sense — you’re good to go Keep doing
this Pull pieces out Withhold Retreat Release and reveal as late as you can An edit is a great place to
massage mystery

You Can Create More Questions That Are Never Answered

A Mystery can create more questions that create more mysteries Good up to a point Eventually there
comes a moment when you end up with more questions that never get answered You have to know
when to stop asking questions that will never get answered and are irrelevant to the outcome of the
story

Sometimes You Don’t Answer Questions

Mysteries and endings A tricky subject My essential advice answer all mysteries by the ending Every
last one of ‘em The audience wants those answers The introduction of a mystery is an unofficial
promise to answer that question But But Sometimes that’s just not in the cards (ie Stephen

King’s The Colorado Kid which is a story as much about the subject of mystery as it is about the
mysteries present in the story) Sometimes it’s good to leave folks hanging on things Because when you
do that it’s like the story is ongoing They remain a part of it — entrenched and unable to escape

A Question

That’s how the stories we tell friends and loved ones and co-workers often begin isn’t it We begin
with a question And the way we tell the story is like leaving a trail of clues for the readeraudience to
follow We say things to get attention to lead the audience in with us through the story

Invoke An Unanswered Question
To create suspense and invoke tension offer the audience a mystery An unanswered question a
lingering puzzle a nagging cipher — the longer it goes unanswered the greater the tension grows

Plot

The art of plotting is all about how you manage your storys information in a way thats entertaining
moving and meaningful A plot needs to grab our interest move us emotionally and effectively convey
the meaning of the events Most people understand the plot as a sequence of events that tells a story But
that definition is not sufficient

Important Aspects To Plot

Refers to the arrangement of events to achieve a specific effect From the moment the plot engages its

focused on where its going - the climax At the climax it produces an intended result in the resolution

TOC
of the story that is clear and emotional

All plots are based on causally related events You are not stringing together a sequence of actions you
are linking together points in the story A happens and causes B to result which in turn causes C
and so on There are connections between the scenes These cause—and-effect relationships between
scenes are instrumental in pushing the action forward and building momentum This cause-and-effect
momentum also develops the meaning of the story by illustrating the consequences of events - showing
how events motivate other decisions and actions by the characters

Plot is conflict Dramatic conflict is the struggle that grows out of the interplay of opposing forces
(ideas interests or wills) Conflict creates the tension that awakens our instinctive desire to watch
people fight it out Implied in the action the characters desires to achieve their ends which in turn puts
them at odds with the opposing forces The conflict of a story poses gripping questions about the fates
of the characters — questions we need answered to satisfy our curiosity about who wins and who loses
so that we can enjoy the accompanying feeling of satisfaction and enjoyment While we are vicariously
absorbed in the fight we also want to understand the nature of the conflict In the end how we
understand the resolution of the conflict is what makes for a gratifying conclusion (See Theme)

Plot is a series of interrelated actions that progresses through a struggle of opposing forces to a climax
that defines the meaning of the work As fundamental as this is many writers forget these basic concepts
when writing their scripts They tell us different details about their characters lives andor move from
incident to incident as if on a timeline instead of linking actions together or finding the heart of the
conflict But these factors play a role in how the audience tracks and makes sense of the events of the
story

Sub-Plots

If you would like to write a script that will stand out from the crowd then using subplots is a great way
of doing so When subplots are done right they can be extremely creative and very memorable The
basic premise behind subplots is to have multiple protagonists andor antagonists who each go through
their own story with some common thread between each of them

Subplots may connect to main plots in either time and place or in thematic significance Subplots often
involve supporting characters those besides the protagonist or antagonist A subplot is a series of
connected

Actions within a story that functions separately from the main plot

Subplots CAN HAVE Different TIE-INS To Your Main Story Plot

Subplots Can ENHANCE Your Main Story Plot
Subplots do this by introducing new characters creating theme and revealing subtext and backstory of
your main story plot

Subplots Can UPSET The Main Story Plot

TOC

Subplots do this by introducing new characters creating a love interest revealing flaws or problems that
the protagonist possesses or is going through Revealing other complicated relationships between the
protagonist and other characters

Subplots Can Be Used To SET-UP Your Main Story Plot

I call this the VISUAL PROLOGUE You’ve seen it before A scene that basically sets the mood tone
style and scope of the main story plot It usually gives us just a glimpse of the protagonist the
antagonist or a victim of the Antagonist

Subplots Can Be The MIRROR OPPOSITE Of Your Main Story Plot
Basically a subplot that shows a storyline that is in complete contradiction to the main story plot

Purpose Of Subplots

v

SAKA

LLL LLL

To slow down the advancement of your main story plot
Reveal backstory
Reveal Exposition
Reveal the character flaws of your protagonist
Introducing other characters
o Reveal subtext
Reveal theme
SHOWING simultaneous action that happens alongside your main story plot
Dumbfound shock frighten mystify excite satisfy and relax the audience
Increasing the stakes of your main Protagonist
Supplying tension
Plugging possible main story plot holes
Tying main story plot into other storylines

Make The Characters Relevant To Each Other’s Plots

Make The Subplots Relevant To Each Other

Try weaving the plots together so they come to a head at the climax of your story Maybe the resolution
to one plot leads directly to the climax of another plot or all of the plots meet and suddenly your reader
audience is hit with the significance of everything that has happened before

All subplots should support inform and eventually wrap up or pay off into your main story plot

Story Structure

What is this emphasis on the three-act structure and where does it come from Ultimately it comes
down to telling a GREAT STORY — PERIOD All the structure in the world will not make a difference
if the story isn’t riveting The readeraudience doesn’t give a rat’s ass about structure We hear that a
movie is broken down into three parts called

when a lady friend made a remark about how dangerous it must be to try to kayak over to the island

ACT II Middle Confrontation
The challenges the hero faces that must be overcome

ACT III End Resolution
The outcome - did the hero accomplish his goal - did he live or die This is just a rough estimation of

what is a pleasing narrative we humans concoct in our stories Here is a personal real-life example

A few years ago I decided on a whim to kayak to Catalina Island

I submit that one of the story forms we as humans relate to happens to have this three-act structure

There are many other story approaches that appeal to us Download one of my stories that was
written without any sense of STRUCTURE And it can be easily adapted into the ‘Three Act
Structure’

‘26 Miles Across the Sea’

ACT I - Life Before The Call To Adventure

v

v

a lady friend had an interest in kayaking so every so often we’d go down to Marina del Rey and
rent two kayaks and paddle out of the marina and go about 12 mile toward Venice Pier then turn
around and head back (normal world)

I convinced her we should buy a couple of kayaks rather than renting them (escalating)

we bought kayaks on eBay and we went to different stores buying other necessities like better
paddles and cheap life vests (getting more committed)

I (idiot) commented how neat it would be if we kayaked to Catalina She not being an idiot said
it looked too dangerous (inciting incident — her remark of the danger)

that seemed like a challenge so I told her I’d kayak myself there to test out how dangerous it
might be (committing myself to the challenge)

I gather everything I think I would need and read up on kayaking to Catalina (trying to be
responsible)

the crossing didn’t sound so difficult So to increase the challenge I would go from Santa
Monica beach to the island against the prevailing winds (underestimating the challenge)

one Saturday morning I pushed off for the island in high spirits

TOC

Curiosity And Concern Have Three Ways To Connect The ReaderAudience To The Story

v

v

Mystery the readeraudience knows less than the character The readeraudience gains interest only
through curiosity

Suspense the readeraudience knows the same or more than the character It combines curiosity and a
concern

Dramatic Irony the readeraudience knows more than the characters Creates interest primarily a
through concern alone

Put Characters That Readers Care About In Jeopardy

For suspense you need empathy concern impending danger and escalating tension Readeraudience
empathy is created by giving the character a desire wound or internal struggle people can identify with
The more they empathize the closer their connection will be with the story Once they care about and
identify with a character the readeraudience will be invested when they see the character struggling to
get what he most desires Readeraudience must worry about whether or not the character will get what
he wants Only when readeraudience knows what the character wants will they know what’s at stake
And only when they know what’s at stake will they be engaged in the story To get a readeraudience
more invested in your novel make clear What your character desires (love freedom adventure
forgiveness etc) what is keeping him from getting it and what terrible consequences will result if

he doesn’t get it Suspense builds as danger approaches Readers experience apprehension when a
character they care about is in peril This doesn’t have to be a life-and-death situation Depending on
your genre the threat may involve the character’s physical psychological emotional spiritual or
relational well-being Whatever your genre show something terrible is about to happen—then postpone
the resolution to sustain the suspense

Escalate the tension in our stories until it reaches a satisfying climax Raise the stakes by making the
danger more imminent intimate personal and devastating So if the moon explodes in Act 1 the entire
galaxy better be at risk by Act 3

If tension doesn’t escalate the suspense you’ve been developing will evaporate It’s like inflating a
balloon - you can’t let the air out of your story instead you keep blowing more in tightening the
tension until it looks like the balloon is going to pop at any second Then blow in more until the
readeraudience can hardly stand it

Include More Promises And Less Action

Suspense happens in the stillness of your story in the gaps between the action sequences in the
moments between the promise of something dreadful and its arrival If a reader complains “nothing is
happening” in a story they don’t typically mean that no action is occurring but rather that no promises
are being made The problem of readersaudiences being bored isn’t solved by adding action but instead
by adding

apprehension Suspense is anticipation action is the payoff You don’t increase suspense by “making
things happen” but by promising that they will Instead of asking “What needs to happen” ask “What
can I promise will go wrong” Stories are much more than reports of events Stories are about
transformations We have to show readersaudiences where things are going—what situation character

TOC

or relationship is going to be transformed Depending on your genre promises can be comedic
romantic horrific or dramatic

(eg two lovers plan to meet in a meadow to elope That’s a promise But the young man’s rival finds
out and says to himself “If I can’t have her no one can” Then he heads to the field and hides waiting
for them dagger in hand The lovers arrive clueless about the danger Milk that moment make the
most of the suspense it offers And then show us what happens in that meadow In other words )

Keep All Promises

In tandem with making promises is the obligation of keeping them The bigger the promise the bigger
the payoff (eg a killer tells a woman whom he’d abducted “Your death will be remembered for
decades” That’s a huge promise to readers I’d better fulfill it by making her death memorable or
terrifying a character tells the hero the villain had “a twist waiting for you at the end that you would
never expect”’)

Another huge promise Readers think OK buddy Let’s see if you deliver So youd better deliver A
huge promise without the fulfillment isn’t suspense - it’s a disappointment Every word in your story is a
promise to the reader about the significance of that word to the story as a whole This is where so many
writers drop the ball If you spend three paragraphs describing a woman’s crimson-colored sweater that
sweater better be vital to the story If not you’re telling the readeraudience “Oh by the way I wasted
your time Yeah that part really wasn’t important to the story” Never disrespect a readeraudience like
that When stories falter it’s often because the writers didn’t make big enough promises didn’t fulfill
them when readers wanted them to be fulfilled or broke promises by never fulfilling them at all Here’s
a great way to break your promise to the readeraudience

Start your story with a prologue say in which a woman is running on a beach by herself and there are
vampires on the loose Let’s see if you can guess what’s going to happen Hmm what a twist this is
going to be—she gets attacked by the vampires Wow What a fresh original idea that was How is that
a broken promise Because it was predictable Readers want to predict what will happen but they want
to be wrong They’re only satisfied when the writer gives them more than they anticipate not less I’m
always annoyed when a writer introduces a character gives me background information on where she
went to college what she studied her love interests her favorite snack food and so on and then kills her
off right away or fails to give her any significant role in the story When readers invest their time they
want that investment to pay off Make big promises Then keep them

Let Characters Tell Readers Their Plans
I know this seems counterintuitive Why would we want readers to know what’s going to happen
Doesn’t that give the ending away I’m not talking about revealing your secrets or letting readers know
the twists your story has in store Instead just show readers the agenda and you’ll be making a promise
that something will either go wrong to screw up the schedule or that plans will fall into place in a way
that propels the story (and the tension) forward Simply by having your characters tell readers their
schedules you create a promise that can create anticipation and build suspense

o “T’ll see you at the noon4 briefing”

o “Let’s meet at Jim ’s for supper at 6”

TOC

o “Allright here’s what I have lined up for the rest of the morning Follow up on the
fingerprints track down Adrian and then stop by the prison and have a little chat with
Donnie ‘The Afternoon Slayer’ Jack”

A story moves through action sequences to moments of reorientation when the characters process what
just happened and make a decision that leads to the next scene We do this in real life as well—we
experience something moving or profound we process it and then we decide how to respond The
problem is in those moments of reflection a story can drag and the suspense can be lost During every
interlude between scenes a promise must be either made or kept And if you resolve one question or plot
thread (that is you keep a promise you made earlier) introduce another twist or moral dilemma (in other
words make another promise)

When a story lags it’s almost always because of missing tension (there’s no unmet desire on the part of
the characters) or not enough escalation (there’s too much repetition) To fix this show us how deeply
the character wants something but cannot get it and escalate the story by making it even more difficult to
get

Cut Down On The Violence

The more violence there is the less it will mean

(eg In ‘Transformers’ we have one battle after another until we become bored with each succeeding
battle)

A murder is not suspense An abduction with the threat of a murder is If you want readers to
emotionally distance themselves from the story show one murder after another after another after
another but if you want to build tension cut down on the violence and increase the readers’
apprehension about a future violent act The scariest stories often contain very little violence And of
course different genre elements dictate different means of suspense In a mystery you might find out
that a person was beheaded This occurs before the narrative begins so the focus of the story is on
solving the crime If you’re writing a horror story you’ll show the beheading itself—in all its gory
details If you’re writing suspense the characters in the story will find out that someone is going to be
beheaded and they must find a way to stop it Reader expectations and the depth and breadth of what is
at stake in the story will determine the amount of mystery horror or suspense you’ll want to include
Nearly all genres include some scenes with them As a writer it’s vital that you become aware of how
you shape those sequences to create the desired effect on your reader—curiosity dread or apprehension
(see the chart on this page) Also remember that valuing human life increases suspense Because readers
only feel suspense when they care about what happens to a character we want to heighten their concern
by heightening the impact of the tragedy Show how valuable life is The more murders your story
contains the more life will seem cheap and if it’s cheap readers don’t need to be concerned if it’s lost

Be One Step Ahead Of Your Readers

When I write my novels I’m continually asking myself what readers are hoping for wondering about or
questioning at each point in the story Our job as writers is to give them what they want when they want
it — or to add a twist so that we give them more than they ever bargained for

Ways To Amp Up The Suspense

As You Develop Your Story Appeal To A Readers’ Fears And Phobias

(Phobias are irrational fears so to be afraid of a cobra is not a phobia but to be afraid of all snakes is)
Most people are afraid of helplessness in the face of danger Many are afraid of needles the dark
drowning heights and so on Think of the things that frighten you most and you can be sure many of
your readers will fear them as well

Make Sure You Describe The Setting Of Your Story’s Climax Before You Reach That Part Of
The Story

In other words let someone visit it earlier and foreshadow everything you’ll need for readers to picture
the scene when the climax arrives Otherwise you’ll end up stalling out the story to describe the setting
when you should be pushing through to the climax

Countdowns And Deadlines Can Be Helpful But Can Work Against You If They Don’t Feed The
Story’s Escalation

For example having every chapter of your book starts one hour closer to the climax is a gimmick that
gets old after a while because it’s repetitious and predictable—two things that kill escalation Instead
start your countdown in the middle of the book To escalate a countdown shorten the time available to
solve the problem

As You Build Toward The Climax Isolate Your Main Character

Remove his tools escape routes and support system (buddies mentors helpers or defenders) This
forces him to become self-reliant and makes it easier for you to put him at a disadvantage in his final
confrontation with evil

Make It Personal
Don’t just have a person get abducted — let it be the main character’s son Don’t just let New York City
be in danger — let your daughter live there

No matter what you write good prose is all about sharpening the suspense

Tense Simple Present Tense seems more immediate Novels are generally written in Past Tense Simple

Present Tense normally takes up fewer words than either the Present Progressive Tense or Past Tense

Shorter is also usually more comprehensible)

Theme

is what the story is about it gives meaning to the plot events hooks us emotionally and is what gives
the story lasting resonance

Theme is one of the most important elements of a great screenplay but if it’s missing it leaves the
reader unsatisfied Your script may be well written with an interesting premise or compelling characters
but if it’s not about something that resonances with the readeraudience it will feel wanting

On the other hand if the theme is too in your face your script will feel preachy and heavy-handed

Finding the right balance is important While the plot is the action that drives the story forward the
theme gives the story events meaning

An effective tool to use is the protagonist’s arc Movies are about transformation We want to see the
protagonist change grow or learn something over the course of the story What they learn — their

spiritual moment — is the moment that tells us what the story is about and articulates the theme

Examples Of Common Themes

v Man vs Nature - ‘Armageddon’ ‘2012’ ’127 Hours’ ‘Jurassic Park’ ‘Jaws’

v Man vs Man - ‘Juno’ ‘American Beauty’ ‘Toy Story 3’

v Man vs Himself - ‘Scarface’ ‘Wall Street’ ‘The Godfather’

v Revenge - ‘The Revenant’ ‘Mean Girls’ ‘Cape Fear’ ‘Carrie’ ‘Kill Bill’ ‘Memento’

v Death as Part of Life - ‘Harold and Maud’ ‘The Lovely Bones’

v Battle - ‘Brave Heart’ ‘300’ ‘We Were Soldiers’

v Individual vs Society - ‘Gattaca’ ‘Erin Brockovich’ ‘Schindler’s List’ ‘Fight Club’ ‘The
‘Elephant Man’

¥Y Triumph over Adversity - ‘The Blind Side’ ‘Slumdog Millionaire’

Y Love Conquers All - ‘The English Patient’ ‘The Adjustment Bureau’ ‘Shrek’ ‘Titanic’

Y Good vs Evil - ‘The Chronicles of Narnia’ ‘Star Wars - The Forces Awakens’

‘The Lord of the Rings’ ‘Harry Potter and the Chamber Of Secrets’

Note There are thousands of possible Themes that may be explored

Voice (Active and Passive)

Screenplays should be written in Active Voice and Present Tense

Active Voice
uses action verbs that show movement or action or that takes place in the moment as opposed to have

TOC

taken place already An actor must be able to perform the action Action is the manifestation of feelings
and thoughts through activity In screenwriting the acid test for action will be whether it is behavior that
actors can perform and a camera can photograph Action should be written in the Present Tense
preferably Simple Present Tense in a sentence using active voice the subject of the sentence performs
the action expressed in the verbusing active voice for most of your sentences makes your meaning clear
for readers and keeps the sentences from becoming too complicated or wordyactive voice is usually
shorter than passive voicesentences in the active voice have energy and directness both of which will
keep your reader turning the pages the thing doing the action is the subject of the sentence and the thing
receiving the action is the objectthe active voice emphasizes the performer (or agent) of the actionthe
active voice is direct (performer—verb-receiver) vigorous clear and concise The reader knows who is
responsible for the action

Why Use Active Voice

At the heart of every good sentence is a strong precise verb the converse is true as well — at the core
of most confusing awkward or wordy sentences lies a weak verb Try to use the active voice whenever
possible

Passive Voice
Uses Conjugations Of ‘to be’ Verb

Infinitive be
Present Participle being
Past participle been
Person
Present Past

Number
Ist

I am was
singular
2nd

You are were
singular
3rd

r hesheit is was
singular

Ist plural We are were
2nd plural You are were
3rd plural They are were

Voice (Active and Passive)
Y the thing receiving the action is the subject of the sentence and the thing doing the action is
optionally included near the end of the sentence

v the Passive Voice in contrast emphasizes the receiver (or product) of the action

v the Passive Voice is indirect (receiver—verb—performer) and can be weak awkward and wordy

TOC
Passive voice uses a form of the verb to be followed by a past participle (eg dispersed
investigated) and a by phrase If the by phrase is omitted (the truncated passive) the reader will not

directly know who or what performed the action

Reasons To Mostly Avoid Passive Voice
Y often the use of passive voice can create awkward sentences

Y overuse of passive voice throughout an essay can cause your prose to seem uninteresting
Recognizing Passive Voice
v the verb phrase will always include a form of ‘to be’ such as am is was were are or been The

presence of a ‘to be’ verb however does not always mean that the sentence is in Passive Voice

Y passive—voice sentences may include a by the phrase after the verb the agent performing the
Action if named is the object of the preposition in this phrase

When To Use Passive Voice

Y to emphasize the action rather than the actor

Y tokeep the subject and focus consistent throughout a passage

Y to be tactful by not naming the actor

Y to describe a condition in which the actor is unknown or unimportant

Y tocreate an authoritative tone

Chapter 3 Screenplay Elements

Aerial Shot

suggests a shot be taken from a plane helicopter drone or from above It follows the TIME in the
SCENE HEADING or is shown in the ACTION LINE and is in CAPS It is a DIRECTED action and
should be left to the director’s interpretation and not in a Spec Script

Note ACamera Shot should not be used in a Spec Script —- Camera Shots break the flow of the story It
has a similar effect as an audience seeing camera booms and stage lighting in the film itself Your job is

to tell a gripping story It’s the director’s job to decide how to film your story Do not
irritate the reader or director with Camera Shots

Example 1 Aerial Shot Avoid in Spec Script - Camera Shot
EXT KABUL STREET — DAY — AERIAL SHOT

A special forces convoy navigates a dangerous part of a war-weary city

SLOW ZOOM IN ON CONVOY
VIEW ON CONVOY — MOVING

(Camera Shot requires extra interpretation takes us out of the narrative and slows the reading)

Example 2 Aerial Shot Implied

EXT KABUL STREET —- DAY
Below a special forces convoy navigates a dangerous part of a war-weary city

CONVOY
RUMBLES along

(this accomplishes the same with narrative and keeps the story flowing — ‘Below’ says the camera is
above — the second line of action shifts the camera to the convoy)

Example 3 Aerial Shot Avoid in Spec Script—Camera Shot

EXT OCEAN —- DAY
AERIAL SHOT - Slowly ZOOM down to SHARK circling a small boy dog-paddling toward a raft

TOC
PAN to the raft and Bill screaming

BILL
Come on Tommy Swim damn it

(Camera Shot requires extra interpretation takes us out of the narrative and slows the reading
Aerial Shot says the view is from above — Zoom says the Shark gets closer — Pan says the camera
moves to the raft)
Example 4 Aerial Shot Implied
EXT OCEAN —- DAY
Moving down closer the SHARK circles a small boy dog-paddling toward a raft
On the raft Bill screams
BILL

Come on Tommy Swim damn it

(moving down closer suggests the shark is filmed from above as an AERIAL SHOT — on the raft

suggests that the filming has changed to the raft itself — this accomplishes the same with the
narrative and keeps the story flowing)

Example 5 Aerial Shot Avoid in Spec Script - Camera Shot

INT BASEMENT — NIGHT

In the dim light Gary PANS the room ANGLE ON the gun causes him to dive behind a storage box
BLAM BLAM

Shots miss as Gary throws a pipe at the room’s only light and shatters it

In darkness Gary breathing heavily scampers across to the staircase

EXT BASEMENT — NIGHT

CLOSE UP on the door handle as it turns and swings open AERIAL SHOT - Ann notices a moving
shadow below

ANN
You alright Gary

TOC

(Camera Shot requires extra interpretation takes us out of the narrative and slows the reading —
PANS the room means Gary scans the room — ANGLE ON the gun means we focus on the gun —
CLOSE UP on the door handle)

Example 6 Aerial Shot Implied
INT BASEMENT — NIGHT

In the dim light Gary scans the room Reacting to a glint off the gun he dives behind a storage box
BLAM BLAM

Shots miss as Gary throws a pipe at the room’s only light and shatters it

In the darkness Gary breathing heavily scampers across to the staircase

EXT BASEMENT — NIGHT

The door handle turns and the door swings open Ann notices a shadow moving below

ANN
You alright Gary

(this accomplishes the same with narrative and keeps the story flowing — scans the room is the
Camera Shot equivalent to a PAN The glint of the gun — would suggest an ANGLE ON the gun
The door handle turns — suggests a CLOSE UP on the door handle — these are Camera Shots
without saying so — it keeps the story flowing and allows the director to decide how to shoot the
scene)

Angle On

is a type of Camera Shot often occurring in large settings It is a DIRECTED action and should be left
to the director’s interpretation

Example 1 Angle On Avoid in Spec Script - Camera Shot

EXT KABUL STREET - DAY

A special forces convoy rumbles down an alley Nervous soldiers point rifles at any suspicious shadow
ANGLE ON - A rifle protrudes over a distant rooftop

TOC
(Camera Shot requires extra interpretation takes us out of the narrative and slows the reading — the

camera shifts to the rifle)

Example 2 Angle On Implied
EXT KABUL STREET —- DAY

A special forces convoy rumbles down an alley Nervous soldiers point rifles at any suspicious shadow
In the distance a rifle protrudes over a rooftop

(this accomplishes the same with narrative and keeps the story flowing — second action block shifts

the attention from the convoy to the rifle)

Example 3 Angle On Avoid in Spec Script - Camera Shot

EXT GRAND CANYON - DAY
The runners rush over the suspension bridge

ANGLE ON - A man leaps into the river

KATHY
You’re an idiot Phoenix

(Angle On means the attention is on the man)

Example 4 Angle On Implied

EXT GRAND CANYON - DAY
The runners rush over the suspension bridge
A man leaps into the river
KATHY
You’re an idiot Phoenix
(this accomplishes the same with narrative and keeps the story flowing Its implied — the attention

shifts from the runners on the bridge to the man leaping into the river)

TOC

Background (bg)

is used to describe anything occurring in a rear plane of action (the background as opposed to the main
action or attention is focused in the foreground) Always use this term in lower case initials or written in
full (background)

Example 1 BG

EXT DOVER CLIFF — DAY

John sits on the ledge of the cliff tying his shoes In the bg Kelly climbs into the car

(always write in small letters in action lines)

Example 2 BG
INT DINER TABLE — NIGHT
John chats with Susan over a fine wine In the background four armed men enter the restaurant

(we see off in the distance a problem is developing)

Example 3 BG
EXT FOREST — NIGHT

Carl sits facing fire An insane look as he points a gun at Tom In the bg Wolf races toward the two
men

(we see off in the distance Tom’s dog coming to the rescue)

Example 4 BG
EXT OCEAN —- DAY

Sarah swims toward the shore In the background a fin breaks the surface moving rapidly toward the
girl

(we see off in the distance that Sarah may not reach safety because she is being stalked)

TOC

Beat

is used in a parenthetical (beat) to interrupt a line of dialogue or action It is a DIRECTED action and
should be left to the director’sactor’s interpretation A beat suggests the actor should pause a moment
in silence before continuing the scene Beats are often interchangeable with — three dots
followed by a space Use sparing if at all You are not the director or actor

Example 1 Beat Use Sparing

INT RECREATION ROOM —- DAY

John looks at Mr Holmes in amazement then back to the TV The Game Show Host reads the last
question

GAME SHOW HOST
Finally the ten-million-dollar question
What did the poor bastard do that
cost him his life

The video zooms in first on the will he carries in his hand

GAME SHOW HOST
Any of you Sherlock Holmes out there
should be able to follow this (beat) Lets
see weve got a new will See it says

WILL DRAFT

(it’s written to pause a moment it probably should be left to the actor’sdirector’s discretion)

Example 2 Beat Use Sparingly

INT RECREATION ROOM - DAY

John looks at Mr Holmes in amazement (beat) He turns back to the TV The Game Show Host reads
the last question

(it’s written to pause a moment it probably should be left to the actor’sdirector’s discretion)

Example 3 Beat Use Sparingly

TOC
INT RECREATION ROOM —- DAY
Mr Holmes writes the ninety-five on a sheet of paper and hands it to John

JOHN
No one can that answer

GAME SHOW HOST
Yes there were ninety-five people in this room

(it’s written to pause a moment using ellipses — it should be left to the actor’sdirector’s discretion)

Close On

suggests a close-up on some object action or person

Note It is a Camera Shot and should be avoided in Spec Script but left to the director

Example 1 Close On Avoid in Spec Script - Camera Shot
EXT LINCOLN MEMORIAL - CLOSE ON CNN REPORTER - DAY

Reporter walks up the steps toward the statue of Lincoln

(we are close on the Reporter — should be left to the director — should not be used in spec script)

Example 2 Close On Clearer Narration

EXT LINCOLN MEMORIAL -— DAY
Reporter walks up the steps toward the statue of Lincoln

(at the director’s discretion we are close on the Reporter — fewer words and clearer narration)

Example 3 Close On Avoid in Spec Script - Camera Shot

MANS VOICE (VO)
This tape will self-destruct in five
seconds

CLOSE ON THE FLASH DRIVE

TOC

The flash drive begins to SIZZLE and slowly smolders until its engulfed in smoke

BACK TO SCENE

Jim tosses the recorder into the trash and walks into the museum

(the ‘Close On’ could be at the discretion of the director — should not be used in spec script)

Example 4 Close On Clearer Narration

MANS VOICE (VO)
This tape will self-destruct in five
seconds
The flash drive begins to SIZZLE and slowly smolders until its engulfed in smoke

Jim tosses the recorder into the trash and walks into the museum

(we know that we Zoomed in on the Flash Drive because it is brought to the forefront when it is
mentioned — the narration is clearer and more script lines are saved)

Closer Angle

is to move in for a new angle nearer to the subject

Note Is a Camera Shot and should be avoided in a Spec Script but left to the director

Example 1 Closer Angle Avoid in Spec Script - Camera Shot
EXT ARENA — DAY

The teams enter to cheers until Team Sauteur steps out of the tunnel into view to BOOS They appear to
be clothed CLOSER ANGLE Sauteur women Body paint glistens off their bodies

TOC

Cont’d or Continued
is when a dialogue block is split either by a page break or an action line you will use the parenthetical

(CONT’D) to indicate the second part of dialogue is a continuation of the first
Cont’d 1

The (CONT’D) will be in line with the speaker’s name and can either be in ALL CAPS or the lower
case (cont’d) if you are consistent throughout your screenplay (CONT’D) will also be used if a large
dialogue block runs over a page break In that case the parenthetical (MORE) should come at the
bottom of the first block centered under the dialogue The dialogue will then pickup atop the next page
with (CONT’D) in line with the speaker’s name

Cont’d 2

Alternately it is acceptable to move the entire block to the second page assuming the void of white
space left at the bottom of the first page isn’t egregious When a shot or scene continues from one page
to the next must be added at the bottom of the page where the break occurs preceded
by a single blank line is then added at the top of the next page followed by a single
blank line

Note Normally MORE CONT’D and not used in Spec Scripts
CONTD is out of use even in production scripts Most Scriptwriting software has the ability to turn on
or off “Cont’d” and “More” in their settings Turning off this in your scriptwriting program will save
several pages You would have Cont’dContinued in production script and
should only be used in scripts in which the scenes are numbered and scenes should
ONLY be numbered in production scripts

Example 1 Cont’d Fallen Out of Use

EXT STADIUM — DAY
JIM
Blake Get over here

He grabs his teammate’s jersey pulls him over

JIM (CONTD)

This one’s coming to you Be ready for the lob

(when the same character speaks after an action — normally left off these days)

Example 2 Cont’d Fallen Out of Use

BILLY
This is our house gentlemen Our home court

TOC
Our city

(MORE)
(2nd page)

BILLY (CONTD)

Are you going to let them come into our house
and disrespect us like that

(normally left off these days)

Continuous

is used sometimes instead of DAY or NIGHT at the end of a SLUG LINELocation Description youll
see CONTINUOUS Continuous refers to an action that moves from one location to another without any
interruptions in time

Note CONTINUOUS is generally optional in writing and can be dropped altogether because each
scene heading implies that it follows the previous one

Example 1 Continuous Not Needed
INT AIRPORT LOBBY — DAY

JANET looks over her shoulder The MEN IN BLACK are still after her toppling an innocent passerby
and sending luggage flying across the linoleum floor

Facing forward again she nearly runs smack into a nun She apologizes wordlessly glances back one
last time before pushing through the glass doors

EXT STREET CONTINUOUS

Janet stumbles to the curb stopping short of the honking traffic — Los Angeles drivers As a bus flies
by blasting her with wind she steps out into traffic A car SWERVES to avoid her She GASPS looks
back The men in black are there

FLASH

Janet gets shot in the back by the men in black

BACK TO SCENE

She shakes off the thought and hops up onto the curb opposite the airport She enters the parking

TOC
garage
INT PARKING GARAGE CONTINUOUS

BANG A shot RICOCHETS into the garage Janet SHRIEKS her steps faltering momentarily but she
recovers

EXT STREET — DAY

The men in black pocket their guns and enter the parking structure

Note As you can see CONTINUOUS is used for some of the Slug Lines

(Both EXT STREET —- CONTINUOUS and INT PARKING GARAGE represents no time passing

between changes in location because Secondary Scene Heading or Scene Heading implies no time
has passed following the previous event)

Crawl

is a term used for superimposed titles or text intended to move updowndiagonally across on screen
Example 1 Crawl Opening Scene In Star Wars
FADE IN

EXT SPACE

A vast sea serves as a backdrop for the MAIN TITLE War drums echo through the heavens as a
ROLLUP slowly crawls into infinity

It is a period of civil war in the galaxy A brave alliance of underground freedom fighters has challenged
the tyranny and oppression of the formidable GALACTIC EMPIRE

Striking from a fortress hidden among the billion stars of the galaxy rebel spaceships have won their
first victory with a battle with the powerful Imperial star fleet The EMPIRE fears that another defeat
could bring a thousand more solar systems into the rebellion and Imperial control of the galaxy would
be lost forever

To crush the rebellion once and for all the EMPIRE is constructing a sinister new battle station

Powerful enough to destroy a planet its completion spells certain doom for the champions of freedom

(the opening crawling exposition captures the imagination)

TOC

‘Star Wars’

Example 2 Crawl Opening Scene In Unforgiven
INT ALICES ROOM - NIGHT

NIGHT IN ALICES ROOM A little bit of moonlight coming in through the tiny window might make a
highlight here and there but thats about all Words begin to crawl across the screen

WRITTEN WORDS (crawl)
Of good family albeit one of modest means
she was a comely young woman and not without
prospects Therefore it was at once heartbreaking
and astonishing to her mother that she would
enter into marriage with William Munny a known
thief and murderer a man of notoriously vicious
and intemperate disposition

The SOUND of Strawberry Alice and Davey Bunting breathing hard and the bed creaking

(the exposition reveals the character of William Munny)
‘Unforgiven’

Crossfade To

is like a Fade to black then Fade to the next scene In other words as one scene fades out a moment of
black interrupts before the next scene fades in It is not to be confused with DISSOLVE since
CROSSFADE TO always involves a black or blank screen

Note This term is not in common use This is an EDITING direction and should be left to the
director and editor Should not be used in a Spec Script

Example 1 Crossfade To Avoid in Spec Script—Transition

INT HERAKLION ARCHAEOLOGICAL MUSEUM -— DAY

A dark-haired wisp of a girl ALENA CAMACHO wanders in fascination through a gallery of
Minoan artifacts A culture lost to antiquity

Oblivious to a rope barrier she approaches a Toreador Fresco depicting the ancient Minoan sport of
Bull—Leaping

TOC

A small hand reaches up to touch the fresco Her father MARCO CAMACHO yanks the girl’s
hand away

MARCO

EXT FALCON’S VILLA — DAWN
Dawn sees a man tapping a walking cane on a stone walkway
SUPER 12 YEARS LATER — MADRID

Out of the mist a large bull ADONIS horns down hot breath SNORTS as it races toward the
charismatic gentleman former matador and promoter PABLO FALCON ‘Courage’

Cut To

is the most simple and common Transition Since this Transition is implied by a change of scene it may

be used sparingly to help intensify character changes and emotional shifts Scene Transitions in a
screenplay indicate changes from one setting to a new setting or from a one-time frame to a different
time frame

Note CUT TO transitions usually are not used especially in a Spec Script since Scene Headings
implies a Transition It’s an EDITING direction and should be left to the director

Example 1 Cut To Avoid in Spec Script—Transition

Dissolve To
is acommon Transition As one scene fades out the next scene fades into place This type of Transition

is generally used to convey some passage of time and is commonly used in montages

Note This is an editing direction and not used in Spec Script

EXT BAKER STREET - DAY

A hansom cab with Holmes and Watsons luggage strapped to the rack on top proceeds

Dream Sequence

Note Flashbacks and dream sequences are inherently uncinematic Mostly because they TAKE US out
of the narrative

Example 1 Dream Sequence

INT APARTMENT— NIGHT

Mike nods off to the TV

INT OFFICE - DAY

Mike wakes up and walks toward the door

EXT OFFICE— DAY

Mike looks up at a blue sun that expands to fill the sky
Mike wakes up and sees Joe handcuffed

(Scenes takes place in all the events between Begin Dream Sequence and End Dream Sequence)

Example 2 Dream Sequence

John collapses
INT APARTMENT— NIGHT (DREAM SEQUENCE)

TOC

A giant snake coils around John’s next John grabs a knife from the table and cuts the head off the
creature

INT APARTMENT - DAY
John wakes in a cold sweat

(this Dream Sequence continues until the next scene heading)

Dual-Dialogue

is when two characters speak at the same time different words written in two columns side by side

Note Dual—Dialogue margins are a bit narrower than standard dialogue margins For the first column
the Character Name starts 2 34 from the left Parenthetical margins are 2 14 from the left and 45
from the right Dialogue margins are 2 from the left and 4 from the right For the second column the
Character Name starts 5 34 from the left Parenthetical margins are 5 14 from the left and 1 14
from the right and Dialogue margins are 5 from the left and 1 from the right There is one blank line
before the first Character Name in Dual—Dialogue (just like a regular Character Name)

Alena Gabriel and the team wait for Eva to return from breakfast Eva approaches
disappointment on her face

EVA

Ellipses and Dashes
En-Dashes (—) Em-dashes(—) and Ellipses () are used to indicate unfinished thoughts but their uses
differ slightly

Do not mistake the Em-dash (—) for the slightly narrower En-Dash (—) or the even narrower hyphen (-)
Those marks serve different purposes

Em-Dashes (— )
Y used to indicate a thought that ends abruptly either because the speaker ended it that way for
effect (“aposiopesis”) or because heshe was interrupted
Y used to set off certain dependent clauses
Y a pair of Em-dashes can be used in place of commas to enhance readability Note however
that dashes are always more emphatic than commas

The Ellipsis ( )
Y aseries of marks that usually indicate an intentional omission of a word sentence or whole
section from the original text being quoted
¥Y commonly used to indicate an unfinished thought or at the end of a sentence a trailing off
into silence
Y used to indicate a part of a quote has been omitted

En-Dash (— )

Y aspace followed by two dashes is used to indicate a thought that ends abruptly either
because the speaker ended it that way for effect (“aposiopesis”) or because heshe was
interrupted

Y not to be confused with hyphens which are used to join words and to separate syllables of a
single word

Example 1 Ellipses

BOB
And you’re telling me this
because
Tim looks guilty unable to answer
BOB

You didn’t lose all the money again

(Bob pauses or trails off before picking up the questioning a moment later)

TOC

Example 2 Ellipses

KIRK
But will they just find Milhouse or will
they find him and kill him

CHIEF WIGGUM
Well theyll when they find him they’ um

KIRK
Um excuse me you didn’t answer me you
just trailed off

CHIEF WIGGUM
Yeah yeah I did kind of trail off there didn’t I”

(Chief Wiggum trails off then he pauses a moment before continuing)

Example 3 Ellipses

BOB
(on phone)
Hey honey it’s me yeah I was talking
to that girl butl yeah butl okay please
stop yelling

(Bob pauses suggesting his wife was talking on the other end of the phone — we can’t hear the other
person speaking)

Establishing Shot

is a shot usually from a distance that shows us where we are A shot that suggests location Often used
at the beginning of a film to suggest where the story takes place For example if our story takes place in
New York we might use a shot of the Manhattan skyline as an establishing shot

Note Normally the director would decide if ESTABLISHING SHOT is needed I would definitely
remove the word ESTABLISHING from the SCENE HEADER

Example 1 Establishing Shot Avoid in Spec Script
EXT MISSISSIPPI RIVERBOAT- NIGHT ESTABLISHING

Fade In

every screenplay should begin with the words FADE IN Suggests movement from darkness to an image
on the screen Typed in ALL CAPS at the left-hand margin followed by a double space and the first
Scene Heading It is used only once at the beginning of a screenplay

Fade In is a smooth gradual transition from complete blackness to a scene (fade in) Always in capital
letters followed by a colon The exception to the first line Fade In is if still in darkness we hear
soundsVvoices

Note Some writers do not have a Primary Screen Heading immediately after the FADE IN

(should NOT LEAVE OFF the FADE IN in Spec Script’s opening scene — gives the reader the
sense the story is starting — if you leave it off the trend is moving in that direction — missing FADE
IN)

Fade Out

ends a screenplay They’re typed to the right-hand margin and followed by three blank lines and the
words THE END in the center of the page FADE OUT is used at the end of the last scene to indicate the
end of the screenplay It is typed at the right margin and is followed by a period The words THE

END (capitalized underlined and centered on the page) follows FADE OUT

Note Some writers leave off the FADE OUT or they leave off THE END Any variation will only
annoy the reader

Favor On
is when a particular character or action is highlighted or favored in a shot The focus is basically

centered on someone or something in particular Use only when necessary

What FAVOR ON means in the screenplay format is that in a scene the camera is supposed to favor a
specific character or object more than others

Note This should not be in a Spec Script This is for the director or director of photography to decide
Example 1 Favor On Avoid in Spec Script - Camera Shot
EXT ARENA — DAY

Flashback

is a scene from the past that interrupts the action to explain motivation or reaction of a character to the
immediate scene

Flashbacks are creative ways to give the audience information about previous events that are needed in
order to develop storylines and to understand the actions of characters throughout the story

Flashbacks correlate with the present generally to justify or to explain the character’s actions in the
present Recalling a significant event from the character’s past can be shown visually providing
significant clues or revelations regarding the character’s motivations

Some Basic Guidelines Include

¥ dont tell the reader about the past until he or she cares about the future

Y aflashback should not stop a movie just to provide exposition

Y a flashback should move the story forward

Y through flashbacks an audience can relive a character’s past rather than just hearing them talk about
it

they can take us right inside a character’s mind

they work equally well in all forms of genres

v they are set apart from other forms of storytelling in that they are concerned with memories and the
impact of the past on the present

Y normally stories are designed to make the audience wonder what will happen but flashbacks make

us wonder what has happened

By reading screenplays with flashbacks youll learn how to transition into and out of them and when to
use them effectively They shouldnt be used indiscriminately Its best to show action in the present time
and use flashback scenes only to give the audience information it cant get from present-time action

To Write A Flashback Scene Ask Yourself Several Questions
v¥ What does the audience need to know about the protagonists past that cannot be shown in a present-
time scene

v¥ Where does the flashback take place Describe the geographic location

v¥ When does the flashback memory take place Pinpoint the time period Did the event take place in
the characters childhood several months ago or many years ago

¥ Who are the other characters in the flashback and why are they important

Y How is the characters memory evoked as a flashback This is known as the transition into the
flashback Does a place sound picture or present event trigger a memory How does the character
return (transition) to the present from his memory or flashback Does someone call his name

Example 1 Flashback

Barry sees the train speeding toward him and leaps from the tracks but his foot catches on a rail tie

Example 2 Flashback
INT CAR - DAY (FLASHBACK)
Robert plunges through the lake ice

(if flashback consists of only one scene it’s alright to write “(FLASHBACK)” after the last part of
the scene heading — the same applies to dream and fantasy sequences)

Example 3 Flashback
INT CONTROL BOOTH — NIGHT

knee valiantly holding back tears

His young mother turns from her cooking and gives him a sympathetic smile Like all mothers she
knows what to do

MOMENTS LATER

Young EGO already feeling better is at a table His mother touches his cheek and sets a freshly made
bow of ratatouille before him warm and inviting The boy takes a spoonful into his mouth---

Ego is frozen Astounded His PEN slips from his hand It CLATTERS to the floor breaking the spell

Flashforward

is a scene that WILL TAKE PLACE in the future which interrupts the action to generate suspense

TOC

Flashforwards function to create mystery and ratchet up the tension by giving the audience a peek at
what’s to come

Note Foreshadowing hints at a POSSIBLE outcome in the future whereas a flashforward is an event
that will happen in the future

Insert

is when a writer pictures a certain close-up at a particular moment in the film heshe may use an
INSERT SHOT This describes a shot of some important detail in a scene that must be given the
cameras full attention for a moment Inserts are mainly used in reference to objects a clock or actions
putting a key in a cars ignition

Used to highlight an object in the scene or include a detail that’s outside the scene but important to it To
complete an Insert do one of three things Return to the dialogue switch locations with a new
Secondary Scene Heading or type BACK TO SCENE at the end

Note Writing important objects in CAPS will convey their importance in the scene and not step on the
director Use Inserts only when truly important

Example 1 Insert

EXT CIRCUS FESTIVAL — DAY

A MAN throws a rubber ball at Inga from about thirty feet She easily sidesteps it His friends laugh and

Intercutting

is a way to simplify the writing while maintaining the flow of the story It works by removing screen
descriptions and Scene Headings from two interacting scenes instead of showing the action cutting
between the two scenes the way it would be seen on screen Though never absolutely required it does
make a script easier to read

Cutting back and forth between two or more scenes These scenes are occurring at the same time
Instead of repeating the Scene Heading for each scene over and over an INTERCUT is used This gives
the reader the sense that the scene is moving rapidly back and forth between locations

Some scripts may use the term INTERCUT BETWEEN At this point two scenes will be shown a few
moments each back and forth

(eg if Laura is stuck in her flaming house and the fire department in on the way a screenplay may call
for intercutting between the flames closing in on Laura and the firefighters riding across town to save
her)

TOC
Note this is a style that can be written around with standard scene breaks Its more to prepare the
reader for the upcoming Slug Line bonanza
Example 1 Intercutting
INT SHERRIS APARTMENT — NIGHT
Sherri starts disrobing in front of her open bedroom window
INT LENNYS APARTMENT — NIGHT

Lenny gets up to cross to the fridge to get a beer He looks out his window and catches a glimpse of
Sherri across the courtyard He freezes watching her

Sherri sits on the bed and unbuttons her double-breasted suit jacket
Lenny moves closer to the window for a better vantage point
Sherri stands hopping a few feet trying to step out of her skirt

Lenny eyes glued to Sherri moves to keep her in view He slams his barefoot into a dumbbell on the
floor

LENNY
Ow

Sherri hears the yelp and looks in Lennys direction

Lenny sees Sherri and DROPS from her view

Intercutting is also at the heart of suspense crosscutting between two scenes or pursuer and pursued

Example 2 Intercutting

Jump Cut To

indicates a jarring hop from one moment in a shot to a moment in the same shot sometime later A
transition which denotes a linkage of shots in a scene in which the appearance of real continuous time
has been interrupted by omission

Lap Dissolve also Dissolve
is a transition between scenes that is achieved by fading out one shot while the next one grows clearer
Its just one image fading out overlapped with another image that is fading in

The Dissolve Is Most Often Used Where

v there is a change in time

Y there is a change in location

Y time needs to be slowed down or sped up

Y there is an emotional component to the subject in the story

Y there is a strong visual relationship between the outgoing and the incoming images

Note Should not be used in Spec Script It’s the director and editor’s job

walks through the courtyard to the entrance to the art gallery Scottie parks his car farther along and
follows her in

Match Cut To

is a transition often used to compare two completely unrelated objects Its films version of metaphor
This involves cutting from one object of certain color shape andor movement to another object of
similar color shape andor movement

(eg In ‘2001 A Space Odyssey’ the classic cut comes towards the beginning of the film After the
apes have used a bone as a weapon for gathering food an ape throws the bone into the air As it falls we
match cut to a spaceship carrying nuclear warheads Both the bone and the ship are of similar shape and
color and both happen to be moving towards the bottom of the screen The cut relates all of technology
to the development of weaponry as it cuts out all of human history)

TOC

A MATCH CUT is kind of the opposite of a Jump Cut instead of a “jump” you want the two images to
match so smoothly that the audience makes the obvious connection between the two

(eg MATCH CUT from the bore of a gun to eclipse of the sun (or moon) A young child’s face
MATCH CUT to the same person as an adult)

These kinds of cuts are asking the audience to add 2 and 2 and get 5 a sum that’s a little more than
each image has separately “a match cut is defined as a cut in film editing between either two different
objects two different spaces or two different compositions in which an object in the two shots

graphically match often helping to establish a strong continuity of action and linking the two shots
metaphorically”

Example 1 Match Cut To Avoid in Spec Script—Transition
EXT STADIUM —- DAY

Drone’s rotors whirr over the football field

INT HOTEL ROOM —- DAY

Ceiling fan blades chop through the hot humid room as Rick assembles a bomb

blown away by the laser

C) Andy runs into his closet wearing his cowboy hat and cowboy pajamas

Andy runs out of the closet clad in Buzz Lightyear pajamas and a homemade spacemans helmet

ANDY
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue

TOC

‘Toy Story’

Match Dissolve To also Match Cut To Dissolve To

contains similar qualities to the MATCH CUT A match dissolve involves two objects of similar color
shape andor movement in the transition from one scene to the next

(eg if Scene A is following (tracking) an arrow whizzing through the forest you might match dissolve
to a tracking shot in Scene B of a bullet whizzing through the inner city)

(eg A young girl in one scene becomes an old witch in the next — position is the same)
Note Should not be used in Spec Script It’s the director and editor’s job

Example 1 Match Dissolve To Avoid in Spec Script - Transition
EXT FOREST CLEARING — DAY

A YOUNG GIRL strides across the broken ground Emerging from the forest before her is a cluster
of village folk

ANGLE ON JACK
who holds up the crystal skull to study it MOVE IN on the skull until it fills the screen

MATCH DISSOLVE TO
CLOSE-UP ON CRYSTAL SKULL
except that this is in a display case at the city museum labeled “Peruvian Quartz Skull”
(in a MATCH CUT TO some element in the scene that is ending will match up to an opening

element in the next scene — obviously there should be a good thematic or story reason to tie the two
elements together)

Pan also Swish Pan

is a camera movement involving the camera turning on a stationary axis

TOC

Imagine standing in one spot on a cliff in Hawaii You want to absorb the view so you without moving
your body or feet turn your head from the left to the right This is the same effect as a pan

POV

stands for “point of view” and is used to indicate that the audience is seeing something from a specific
angle or through a particular character’s eyes

The camera replaces the eyes (sometimes the ears) of a character monster machine surveillance
camera etc As a result we get to see the world through a sensory device This can be used to bring out
the personal aspects of a scene or it can be used to build horror and suspense

When a shot originates from a particular character’s “point of view” it’s customary to break it out with
its own Secondary Scene Heading This Secondary Scene Heading must state the character by name
and refer to what the character sees It’s not enough to simply write (eg “KATHY’S POV”)

POVl POV 2

Note This is generally viewed as directing and should not be used in a Spec Script

Example 1 POV Avoid in Spec Script - Camera Shot

Pre-Lap or PreLap

is when dialogue begins before we’ve cut to the scene in which it’s spoken

Note Some people advocate only using VO and not using PRE-LAP at all Others believe
using OS in conjunction with PRELAP

Example 1 Pre-Lap
EXT PARKING LOT — NIGHT

ANOTHER COUPLE They all laugh

TOC

SIMON

(I could have used WIFE (PRE-LAP) instead of WIFE’S VOICE (PRE-LAP) — but using the latter

approach is more immediately clear we’re not seeing the character speak the line)

Series Of Shots

is like a Montage but it usually takes place in one location and concerns the same action in one piece of
time When the shots are so short and disjointed as to make it awkward to present them as scenes

A SERIES OF SHOTS is a matter of style They can be numbered alphabetical not numbered

A SERIES OF SHOTS are action paragraphs and maybe 1) 2) 3) — A) B) C) —- Just be consistent
Some writers will incorporate a Series of Shots into a script without noting it as such This generally
contributes to a smoother flow of the action The action lines might be short descriptive sentences on
separate lines

Questions to Ask About Series of Shots

Y does it tell a story A SERIES OF SHOTS should convey a cohesive straight linear narrative and it
should tie into and advance the overall story

Y is it entertaining It’s not enough just to pick out select shots or images you must craft each shot so
it is compelling or interesting

¥Y doI really need to use one They may work well in a movie but they break up the story flow in a
script So only use a SERIES OF SHOTS if absolutely necessary

Example 1 Series of Shots
— — John tries to do a handstand but fails

— —John attempts a pull-up but fails

Split Screen Shot

is when the space of the frame is split into two three or more frames each with their own subject

Super or Superimpose

is to superimpose over the image — text or image
Note Do not use SUPERSUPERIMPOSE unless there is a definite need It is overused Do not place

it above the Scene Heading or immediately below the Scene Heading but within the scene itself In other
words it should come after at least one sentence of action

Note But these days ’ve seen plenty of SUPERSUPERIMPOSE directly below the Scene Heading and
above the first line of action That would suggest that unless a transition is before the first action line
then the SuperSuperimpose would be over the black screen before the action starts

Example 1 Super

go completely blurry Imagine yourself in the center of a merry-go-round thats moving really fast
Aside from making you totally dizzy the world becomes a blur swished out in the movement like a

Time Cut

is when you want to cut to later in a scene you have the option of writing TIME CUT as the Transition

(eg if two people walk into a restaurant and their conversation is important at first then veers off into
topics not crucial to your story then you might want to time cut from the drinks to the main course and
then again to pay the check)

Note This is a Camera Shot and should not be in a Spec Script

Tracking Shot (Track Tracking)
involves a camera following a person or an object As long as the camera isnt locked down in place by a
tripod for example and is following (tracking) a subject then its a tracking shot

(eg watch the one-take episode of ‘The X—Files’ or most any episode of ER ‘Star Wars Episode
One’ has tracking shots galore during the pod race And Im sure most films have some form of tracking
shot or another)

Note This is a Camera Shot and should not be used in a Spec Script

VO (Voice Over)

is the abbreviation sometimes seen next to the CHARACTERS name before certain dialogue This
means the character voices the dialogue but his or her moving lips are not present in the scene Voice
over is generally used for narration The inner thought processes of the character said out loud such that
only the audience will hear it

Example 1 VO Correct

Wipe To

is a Transition in which one scene wipes away for the next scene

(eg Imagine Scene A is water and Scene B is the substance underneath A wipe would look like a
squeegee pulling Scene A off of Scene B)

Chapter 4 Common Mistakes

You Include Camera Shots In Your Spec Script
Note Avoid in a Spec Script Camera Shots they break the flow of the story They have the effect of
seeing camera booms stage lighting and props in the film — takes one out of the story

v you are not writing for the director

v you are writing for a reader (story analyst) and they don’t want to see Camera Shots

v your script should maximize readability and storytelling Camera Shots confuse the narrative
v camera shots break up the flow of the story

v scenes won’t be shot the way they are written

v

you’re not the director Locations change Exact details change - your script is just a
BLUEPRINT for what might be to be modified by the director and everyone else up the
decision chain

v use Camera Shots rarely (if ever) and only fora DRAMATIC or COMEDIC moment (even then
it can be rewritten in narrative form)

Why Most people have trouble reading a script since it is not written as what they are used to reading a
story novel And you want whoever finally reads your script (investor producer agent actor friend) to

have maximum clarity on your story Camera Shots breaks up the flow of the story and reduces reader
understanding The above bullet points apply

You Are Boring

The number one rule is not to be boring To achieve this you must have an original story and
riveting

TOC

Dialogue No one’s interested in the everyday lives of anyone No one’s interested in cliché dialogue
they have heard a hundred times No one’s interested in action scenes they have seen countless
times No one’s interested in convoluted storylines that begs the question - why bother No one’s
interested in endings that make no logical sense in which the hands of fate decides the hero’s journey
or that the hero had the power

from the beginning to accomplish what happened in the finale See Creativity

Why People are always waiting for a story that captures the imagination which they have never
seen before which has brilliant dialogue and has an emotionally and logically fulfilling ending Write
this and the movie industry will beat a path to your door

Lack Of Originality

If you don’t tell an original story you can throw it in the trash Today innovation is taking place on
TV and media Genres are being combined Partly responsible for this is unlike a two-hour movie the
time frame of TVMedia series can be hundreds of hours This allows more story threads more
characters and a more complicated plot To compete against this two-hour screenplays must be as
efficient as possible Every scene word and character count But as the title says ‘It’s All About
Story’ an original story powerfully written in an acceptable format with no errors will get you
noticed See Creativity

(ie I believe in the future the theater movie will serve as the pilot for longer TVmedia series)
Why Today you will see much of the originality in movie series are on NetflixAmazonHuluetc
Part of the reason for this is the format A series is longer than the standard 2-hour movie allows
characters to be developed much further with more nuance and since each episode must be exciting
enough to have the audience interested in seeing the next episode the writing is usually consistently
good

Original Story1 ‘PETA- People Eating Tasty Animals’ (Dark ComedyHorror)

Original Story 2 ‘A Handful of Stardust’ (Sci-Fi)

Original Story 3 ‘Tar’ (Sci-FiHorrorSuspense)

TOC

You Wrote The Wrong Genre
If you write in a specific genre the readeraudience has expectations - deliver on them In Crime it’s
to catch a criminal In Detective it’s to find the truth Horror is to defeat a monster For Love its to
find love Myth is to go on a journey ultimately leading to oneself Know your genre Every person
that goes to a movie to watch a specific genre (eg western drama sci-fi horror comedy romance
action thriller etc) has expectations based on the type of movie These days many movies cross
multiple genres Movies also have to take into account what each genre expects (eg ‘in a western
the audience expects a gunfight’ ‘in a romance the audience expects people falling in love’ ‘in
horror the audience expects monsters andor gruesome killings by evil supernatural beings’ ‘in
action the audience expects fighting sequences’ ‘in a comedy the audience expects to laugh’ etc)
Why If the audience is expecting what would typically occur in a specific genre and you don’t
deliver they will hate the movie and by extension they will hate you and your story Figure out the
goal of your hero and see what genre or combination of genres it matches

Story Only Interests You
You are excited about a story based on your own life Yeah This is almost ALWAYS a loser But
whatever story idea you have you should run it by your friends and even better people who don’t
particularly like you If they go crazy about what an amazing story then you might have something
If they limp handily and say its good that my friend is Subtext for it’s a piece of crap)
See You Get Excited If Someone Says They Like Your Script
Why Because everybody has different taste the greater the appeal your screenplay has to the largest
audience the greater the chances you will find the right combination of people to finance it produce
it direct it star in it and watch the final product

Story Is About Misery
People go to the movies to be entertained to feel good when they leave the theater People don’t
what to feel depressed and miserable Not only does the public not want to watch a depressing
movie producers and directors and investors don’t want to make such a movie

Title Sucks

It all begins with a compelling title that seduces the readeraudience to want to know more Titles
should suggest what the movie is about indicate the genre or capture the imagination

(eg The Awards - terrorists invade the Academy Awards and slaughter A-list actors in macabre as
the world discovers heroes and cowards Final Call - Terrorists take over the premier retirement
facility for veterans in Washington DC Retired veterans rally for one more call to duty to take back
the facility

PETA - People Eating Tasty Animals - People on PETA’s hit list are taken out one at a time in
horrific manners CUJO- Canine Unit Joint Operations A modern take on Stephen King’s
classic horror movie)

Note Commissioned to write the Cujo remake based on my title and story ideas

TOC

Why When I decide to see a movie I first see what movies are in the genres I enjoy Then I look at
each of there TITLES and if it captures my imagination I’ll next read the logline If the TITLE
doesnt register then I’1l move on to the next movie on my list More important readers get
impressions and expectations from script titles and if those expectations are not met then the reader
is disappointed

Excessively Detailed Character Descriptions

Why It’s almost certain that the actor playing the character in your movie will not have the physical
characteristics you describe The greater the details described in the physical characteristics the less
the chances that a GOOD actor will have those exact characteristics It’s more important the actor
can display the emotional components (ACTING ABILITIES) that are required for the part

(eg In the ‘Reacher’ actionthriller book series by Lee Child Jack Reacher is six feet five inches
In the movie franchise Jack Reacher is played by Tom Cruise who is five feet seven inches)

Example 1 Excessively Detailed Character Descriptions Excessive Details

INT BEDROOM - DAY

(the truth is the character cast for the part will not match this — the bad spill when she was seven
can’t be visualized as written — also this eats up a lot of space with no character development since
we know nothing about her character)

Example 2 Excessively Detailed Character Descriptions Not Excessive - Easy to Visualize

INT BEDROOM - DAY

(written to visually connect to readeractorinvestor — this is a character an actress could get into —
this is also easier on casting than a laundry list of physical traits)

Example 3 Excessively Detailed Character Descriptions Not Excessive - Easy to Visualize

INT BASEMENT REC ROOM - DAY

TOC
A six-year-old girl sits watching the show intently
This is OLIVE She is big for her age and slightly plump

She has frizzy hair and wears black-rimmed glasses She studies the show very earnestly
(we get a powerful image of this girl dreaming of winning a beauty pageant — notice one image at a

time so who she is forms in our mind as we read)
‘Little Miss Sunshine’

Not Enough Description
Why A person attempts to develop a mental image of a character as soon as they are encountered
age gender type of person they are special physical attributes emotional make-up

(ie ’ve read many screenplays that hid the gender of a character in which I had assumed one

gender and found out many pages later they were the other This has a very annoying effect and I
wonder at the competence of the writer)

Note Physical characteristics (size weight hair color etc) and dress are usually the least

important because the actor chosen will most likely not be physically like the character described
and clothes also change

Example 1 Not Enough Description Under Description

INT CROWD - DAY

(we described Jack’s physical characteristics but know nothing about who he really is — we limit the
range of actors that can play the part — the important characteristics are his personality none are
listed here — from the book series ‘Jack Reacher’ by Lee Child)

Example 2 Not Enough Description Under Description

INT CROWD - DAY

TOC

(we don’t know much about Jane — we don’t know her age — young could be 5 or 18 — we don’t

more important traits we have no clue about — is she bipolar — does she have a special talent like a
photographic memory — does she have psychic abilities — does she stutter — is she incredibly
sensual)

Over Describing
Why If you over-describe each scene we lose the creative input of the actor director stunt
coordinator casting director costume designer etc A second reason is the number of lines taken
up in the script which could be better put to use in character development and story

Example 1 Over Describing Excessive Description

INT TEST ROOM - DAY

Clete pauses thinking hard He bites his lip in abject desperation then puts the eraser of the pencil in his
mouth He begins to chew on the end like a hungry rodent nibbling absentmindedly on something he
knows not what Clete now puts the pencil to the paper and begins to darken one of the circles next to
question number fourteen He stops though wondering if this is the right answer and moves the pencil

point just a fraction to the left

(this massive description would limit the actor’s creativity take up space and would never be used
because the director would have a major say on how the scene would be shot)

Example 2 Over Describing Excessive Description

INT HALLWAY — DAY

(micromanaging details of the actor’s movements takes up space annoys the actor and stops the
actor at using their own creativity to improve the action plus the director is likely to change what is
happening)

Back To Back Scenes In Same Locations
Why Often the writer will have scenes that take place in the same location but later immediately
following The writer needs to be careful to somehow show the passage of time If possible it’s good
to go to a scene in a different location before returning to a location — this will show the passage of
time

Example 1 Back To Back Scenes In Same Location No Idea How Much Time Has Passed

Jane swims underwater the length of the pool

Jane lounges around the pool

(as written there is no indication by the readeraudience any time has passed)

Example 2 Back To Back Scenes In the Same Location We Know Time Passed

Jane starts her stopwatch and dives in and swims underwater the length of the pool
TOC

Jane lounges around the pool Her watch beeps She looks down at her watch

You Tell And Don’t Show
Y film is a visual and auditory medium
¥ don’t tell us about a momentous event when you can create an image with or without narration
¥ humans are visual — we learn things more quickly and readily by seeing
¥ showing is quicker than telling
¥ don’t waste screen time — the quicker you can convey the necessary information the better
Why It’s almost always better to show the action than describe the action As they say “A picture
worth a thousand words”
Example 1 You Tell And Don’t Show Visualized Action

EXT ROAD — NIGHT

TOC

INT BAR — NIGHT
Judy sits mesmerized as an animated Ray flaps his cast through the air as his story unfolds

(we’re fascinated because we see the accident in real-time — we aren’t told after the fact — visually
seeing this scene is more potent than Ray relaying the incident — it’s usually shorter)

Example 2 You Tell And Don’t Show Talking - Not Visualized

INT BAR — NIGHT
Ray and Judy sit at a table sharing a pitcher Ray’s arm’s in a cast

JUDY
How’d that happen

RAY

(Ray tells us what happened — we don’t see the action — if this scene follows the previous scene
where we see the action we’d want to remove this scene in favor of the more powerful show scene)

Pointless Dialogue
If it doesn’t further the plot or reveals necessary character it shouldn’t be there unless it entertains
— the reason most people go to the movies is for entertainment If you have pointless dialogue it should
stay vivid in a readeraudience’s imagination and elicit some level of emotion
Why Because of the time constraints (2-hour movie) to tell the most complete story as possible
there is not enough time to diverge into pointless dialogue that doesn’t advance the story

Example 1 Pointless Dialogue Talking - Not Visualized

INT BAR — NIGHT

John watches his friend Bill at the pool table play one shot after another as he runs the table

JOHN

Bill knocks in the three ball

JOHN

Bill knocks in the six ball

JOHN

Bill knocks in the nine ball

(John repeating the Action we see seems pretty much a waste of time — pointless)

You Give Music Information
Dont tell the director what the soundtrack will be
Why You are not the music director You don’t know the price of having the rights to the music
It’s the director’s vision of what he wishes to accomplish

You Give Credits Information

Normally don’t tell readerproducerdirectoretc where to place credits
Why You are not the director or producer They will likely have their own ideas

Poor Creation Of Suspense And Tension
There are three kinds of tension in a story Static Jumping and Slowly Rising The third is the most
desirable because it neither stalls the action nor defies logic
(eg a student badgers his teacher about a grade on the midterm)

Static They argue back and forth and the problem is not resolved

Jumping They argue and suddenly for no other reason the student plunges a knife into the
teacher’s chest killing him

Slowly rising The argument leads to either action or a revelation that develops the narrative or
characterizations in a believable way

Why Keeping the audience on the edge of their seat is the function of SUSPENSE Suspense is not
the same as action nor is it the same as surprise Suspense is the ANTICIPATION of action The
longer you draw out the anticipation the greater the suspense Suspense adds spice to any scene
Every screenplay no matter the genre needs some type of suspense to keep the audience interested
for the duration Without suspense and tension the film can drag

TOC
See Suspense
Example 1 Poor Creation Of Suspense And Tension No Suspense
INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
An impatient General throws papers in his briefcase as Ambassador Richards talks

AMBASSADOR
Listen General we need to talk this out

The General pauses and takes a seat at the table

GENERAL
Ok Let’s get this over with

KABOOM This explosion takes out everyone in the room

(there is no suspense because we don’t know about the bomb under the table — if we added a scene of
the ticking bomb concealed under the table counting down with a few seconds left then we’d be
worried about the General sitting down and talking to the Ambassador)

No Suspense

Suspense is the feeling of uncertainty and anxiety about the outcome of certain actions
Small Talk catapults the readeraudience into a coma Everyday life events aren’t interesting We go
to the movies to ESCAPE boring everyday lives of quiet desperation

See Suspense
Why We want something to capture our interest and imagination something we haven’t seen or
heard before which grips our emotions and won’t let go

Example 1 No Suspense No Suspense

Lack Of Tension

Tension refers to a sense of heightened involvement uncertainty and interest as experienced as the
climax of action approaches Tension is evoked by how much the readeraudience cares about what
happens to a character

Or to be precise tension is about the presumed emotional impact of possible consequences The
readeraudience may dread a certain event but only because they’re looking ahead to the

consequences of that event and sampling the emotional impact it will have

Tense scenes leave the readeraudience both desperate to see what comes next and afraid of the
outcome Tension is the most immediate form of reader engagement and one of the most visceral

The key to increasing tension isn’t to increase the severity of the event but to increase the reader’s
caring and understanding of the characters involved

The most mundane event can inspire more tension than a life and death exchange if the reader cares
enough about the characters

It’s a social impulse that fear increases if we’re around other people who are expressing fear And
when a readeraudience is involved with the story characters can count as people

TOC

Tension needs to be released not just negated It can release when the dreaded event takes place the
expected emotional reaction converting to an actual emotional reaction

(eg In the movie ‘Eye in the Sky’ we first are introduced to a young African girl who wants to
play with her hula hoop Her society frowns on this We empathize with her and her possible fate in
the society she lives in Once we empathize with her we worry about her well-being throughout the
rest of the story as a military attack drone flies above a compound she is selling bread next to Every
moment builds tension as we visualize the horrible outcome as time runs out on the decision to bomb
a terrorist compound that will likely kill the girl)

Why Tension is what a readeraudience lives for

Note Tension is slightly different than suspense which is how much the readeraudience cares
about what comes next See Suspense

Example 1 Lack Of Tension No Tension

EXT RAILROAD TRACK - DAY

JOHN drunk runs onto the tracks and faces the oncoming train He flips it the bird A moment later
John’s severed arm slides into the ditch still railing against life

Two dogs rush up and fight over John’s arm

(we feel no tension or suspense because we have just been introduced to the character John which
we know nothing about and we have no warning about what is about to occur — for the tension we
must CARE about what will happen to a character)

Saved In Nick Of Time (Deus Ex Machina)

When something or someone out of the blue without any logical reason saves the day the
readeraudience will feel cheated and annoyed
Why It shows a lack of imagination on the part of the writer

There are few things more annoying when watching a movie than a supernatural force (God) out of
NOWHERE steps in and saves the protagonistworld

(eg ‘War of the Worlds’ super-powerful science of Martians fall prey to common bacteria ‘Lord of
the Rings The Two Towers’ Giant Eagles constantly save our fellowship at times of life and death
You’d think you could fly the Eagles to Mordor and bypass everything)

Example 1 Saved In Nick Of Time Deus Ex Machina

EXT WATERFALL — DAY

TOC

The ZOMBIES swarm toward Jason He backs to the edge a thousand feet below waves crash on the
rocks

Above the storm clouds turn dark A few more seconds and the Zombies will be upon him

Jason has the look of a man resigned to his fate Suddenly a thunderbolt from the storm strikes the

(if the hero doesn’t have an active hand in his fate the readeraudience feels cheated NEVER HAVE
AN OUTSIDE FORCE save the day — if so your script is poorly thought out and it shows a lack of
imagination)

Example 2 Saved In Nick Of Time Deus Ex Machina

INT CAVE — NIGHT
The Pirate pulls his sword and levels it at Susan Susan desperate looks around

PIRATE
There is no help here Any last remarks

Susan steps back as the Pirate advances slicing his sword menacingly through the air An evil booming
laugh erupts from the Pirate as he takes his final steps to impale Susan

A swarm of bats awake and drops from the roof engulfing the Pirate Moments later a skeleton drops to

the ground Susan runs out of the cave

(Susan had no active roll in her own rescue —The readeraudience feels cheated — NEVER HAVE
AN OUTSIDE FORCE out of nowhere save the day — if so your script is poorly thought out lacks
imagination and shows lack of compelling originality)

Can’t Be Captured By The Camera
The camera in Action lines can capture the specific words spoken the expressions of the actor’s
body and face which represents emotions but can’t capture any SPECIFIC thoughts
Why The camera can’t reach into a character’s head and read SPECIFIC thoughts You can show
emotional content with the words in action making action in many ways a character in the story
Use words that suggest an emotional state when read

Example 1 Can’t Be Captured By The Camera Invisible To Camera

TOC

EXT BALCONY — NIGHT

Looking up at the stars we knew Kathy was thinking about her first boyfriend Jack twenty years ago

(the camera does not have mind-reading abilities — if the camera can’t see it we can’t see it)

Example 2 Can’t Be Captured By The Camera Shows Emotional State

EXT BALCONY — NIGHT

John slips off the roof Oh Shit An expression of stunned disbelief came across him

(the words in action can suggest an emotion that the actor can find useful to adapt to the scene ‘Oh
Shit’ suggests an emotional reaction the actor would experience)

Unrealistic Action
If a character does something outside the reality of the story world the readeraudience disengages
because the rules of the story universe have been broken along with the illusion of the story

(eg In a historical bio about Abraham Lincoln he turns into a bat and flies to Gettysburg to deliver
his famous address as a bat)

Why You don’t want anybody to read a scene in your screenplay and think ‘WHAT NONSENSE’
Your reader immediately disengages and your script is finished

Example 1 Unrealistic Action Poor
EXT TOWER — DAY

From the tower Tom glances down eighty feet to the asphalt He jumps and rolls as he lands and springs
to his feet

TOM
Glad I took that modern dance course It

gave me really good flexibility

(NO An eighty-foot fall will kill a person — in a rational world it makes no sense)

Example 2 Unrealistic Action Poor

TOC

TOM
They say the pen is mightier than the sword Huh
I guess the pencil is mightier than the gun

(NO You can’t overpower twenty armed men with a pencil unless this is a comedy or a martial art
superhero movie - NO An eighty-foot fall will kill a person In a rational world it makes no sense)

Clichéd Dialogue
an overused phrase that betrays a lack of original thought Remove as much as possible (preferably
all)
Why The reason cliché dialogue exists is the most familiar words and phrases you’ve heard many
times before is always on the surface of your thoughts So the first dialogue a writer reaches for is
the easiest familiar phrases These should be avoided because the readeraudience expects these
which means they stop
being engaged for a moment If you replace a cliché with an original phrase that makes sense in the
context of the story the readeraudience is surprised and engages deeper into the story

Example 1 Clichéd Dialogue Poor
INT HOUSE —- DAY
There’s a knock at the door Jason leans over to Jane

JASON

Jane’s stuffing her face with Carmel corn mumbles incoherently

JASON

JANE

TOC
Jason walks over and kicks open the door Dr Evil stands before him with a gun

JASON

Dr Evil lifts the gun and points it at Jason

DR EVIL

(BORING Every line an overused cliché — each one puts a nail in the coffin on the script — they

cause the readeraudience to disengage from the story)

Blocks of Exposition

is trying to concentrate a large amount of exposition all at once to move the story forward Don’t do

this

Why It feels forced and artificial It’s better to slowly impart information to the readeraudience as

the information becomes relevant to the story
Example 1 Blocks Of Exposition Poor
EXT CAVE — NIGHT
Kathy and John stumble through the darkness

KATHY

JOHN

(massive amount of boring exposition — do we really need this)

Example 2 Blocks Of Exposition Minimum Needed Exposition

EXT CAVE — NIGHT

TOC

Kathy and John stumble through the darkness

KATHY
I should have never listened to you

JOHN

(conveys the information only as needed)

Putting Action In Parentheticals

Action belongs in action lines

See Parentheticals

Why It confuses the reader for a moment to see what is clearly action in a parenthetical
Example 1 Putting Action In Parentheticals Avoid
INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

BILL

This is damn good

(Action belongs in actiondescription and not in Parentheticals)

Underusing Scene Headings

Every time or location changes you need a Screen Heading
Why It’s confusing if a location is changed within a scene

Example 1 Underusing Scene Headings Poor
INT LIVING ROOM —- DAY

Jean switches on the TV A gun fires as thirty thousand runners take to the streets of the fifty-fifth
Boston Marathon Jean leans back in his chair

A Kenyan crosses the finish line in two hours five minutes and five seconds Jean wakes from a nap

(time changed but we forgot to put a Secondary Scene Heading or new Scene Heading to show this)

TOC

Example 2 Underusing Scene Headings
INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Jean switches on the TV A gun fires as thirty thousand runners take to the streets of the fifty-fifth
Boston Marathon Jean leans back in his chair

A Kenyan crosses the finish line Race display reads — two hours five minutes and five seconds Jean
wakes from a nap

(time changed but now we know it because we see the runners beginning to finish — over two hours

later — could have replaced ‘INT LIVING ROOM —- LATER’ with Secondary Scene Heading
‘LATER’)

Inconsistent Character Names
If you must introduce a character with one name and then re-name himher later on be sure to be
clear and only do it once And once the name changes keep the new name Don’t go back and forth
Also watch the he’s and she’s and keep the genders correct
Why It leads to confusion of the readeraudience
See Character 3
Example 1 Inconsistent Character Names Poor
INT LIVING ROOM - DAY
Jennifer switches on the TV With the remote he switches on the marathon Jean leans back in her chair
(lots of inconsistent names Jennifer is first a girl — then a male — then a different name — then a
female — very confusing and annoying)
Example 2 Inconsistent Character Names
INT GREEN ROOM — NIGHT

There’s a knock on the door

DIRECTOR (OS)
Dr Bill your on in one minute

TOC

REBECCA
He’s just changing

The doorknob turns

Rebecca transforms into Dr Bill

One second please
The director steps in and scans the room There’s a lump under the covers of a small cot

(if the character is now going to be known by a different name At first mention of a new name put
the old name in parentheses next to the new name and don’t mention the old name again)

Overuse Of Transitions
Whenever there is a jump in time andor location we may bridge the gap using a transitional
instruction (Don’t use Transitions in a Spec Script They slow the pace and rhythm of the script)
Why They take up space that could better be used to create a more compelling story There is also a
tendency to have fewer Transitions in all screenplays these days They are usually put in a shooting
script at the discretion of the director

(ie CUT TO commonly not used these days)

CUT TO to go from one scene or element in a scene to another very quickly

DISSOLVE TO indicates that time has passed one scene melts or fades into another scene

FAST CUTTING is several consecutive shots of a brief duration (eg 3 seconds or less) It can be used to
convey a lot of information very quickly or to imply either energy or chaos Fast cutting is also frequently
used when shooting dialogue between two or more characters changing the audiences perspective to either
focus on the reaction of another characters dialogue or to bring attention to the non-verbal actions of the
speaking character

INTERCUT WITH two scenes will be shown a few moments each back and forth

IRIS IN refers to a wipe from the center of the frame out in all directions Its as if the iris of a human eye
were opening for dimly lit situations to take us into the next scene

IRIS OUT Reverse IRIS IN (eg used at the end of Star Wars scripts)

LAP DISSOLVE a Transition between scenes that is achieved by fading out one shot while the next one
grows clearer

MATCH CUT if you want to illustrate that there is some correlation between something we just saw and
something in the new scene

RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO used to start many dream sequences

SMASH CUT a quick or sudden cut from one scene to another

FADE IN this is the start of the screenplay the screenplay should begin with this

TOC

FADE TO used as a DISSOLVE to a COLOR

FADE OUT equivalent to THE END in a novel the screenplay should end with FADE OUT

TIME CUT When you want to cut to later in a scene you have the option of writing TIME CUT as the
Transition For example if two people walk into a restaurant and their conversation is important at first then
veers off into topics not crucial to your story then you might want to TIME CUT from the drinks to the
main course and then again to pay the check

WIPE TO a transition in which one scene wipes away for the next See WIPE TO

Note In a Spec Script only FADE IN and FADE OUT should be used Transitions muddy the
readability and is the job of the director)

Example 1 Overuse Of Transitions Avoid in Spec Script

INT HOUSE —- DAY

CLOSE ON Alena running toward the barn

Mini-Cooper closing in on her
ANGLE ON barn door

Marcelo stumbles out DRUNK

INT HACIENDA — DAY
Maria hoovers over Marcelo She pours him a cup of coffee

MARIA
Your father is expecting those horses to be ready

(Transitions slow the rhythm and the flow of the story — they make the reading and flow of the story
more difficult to follow — they are also usually determined by the director)

Example 2 Overuse Of Transitions Avoid in Spec Script

TOC
EXT LONDON EYE - DAY

Robert glances at his watch and steps aside to let a family board and fill up the current observation
capsule As the next capsule pulls up Robert steps aboard

As the capsule approaches its apex Robert glances at his watch which clicks to 200 pm NOTHING

THE QUEEN waves from the top of Big Ben
INT LONDON EYE —- DAY

Robert sneers out the viewport toward Big Ben

The Queen smiles and waves toward ‘The London Eye’

(Transitions require more interpretation and slow the flow of the story)

Poor Dialogue

Mistakes that lead to poor dialogue (Pointless dialogue Overwriting Inconsistencies Passive

Protagonist Unnecessary Words On-The-Nose dialogue Chit-ChatSmall Talk Exposition)
Pointless dialogue See Pointless Dialogue
Over writing Long description paragraphs or Slug LinesScene Headings fill your pages with text and
turn off any potential readers who have a limited amount of time to get through your script and get bored
and intimidated by large blocks of words Keep it clear and only include the things necessary to paint a
picture in the reader’s mind
Inconsistencies Little details that don’t add up you think they don’t matter Give your reader
audience some credit — they do Sometimes tiny puzzle pieces that don’t connect are a sign of a deeper
underlying plot problem that weakens your story’s impact
Passive Protagonist Things happen to your protagonist and he reacts moving toward his goal A
passive protagonist can only remain passive if he is entertaining He isn’t actively pursuing his goal It’s
easier for an Active protagonist because he is pushing back at the world and that’s usually more
interesting
Unnecessary Words Less is more Keep a sharp eye for unnecessary words because the more you
eliminate the more room you give yourself with your page maximum Keep action tight

Why Usually clarity comes from fewer words

Example 1 Unnecessary Words Less Clear

TOC

(long wordy phrases usually takes the impact out of the words in actiondescription lines)

Example 2 Unnecessary Words Clear

(not just face but the entire body — greater clarity usually comes from tighter and fewer words —
offers actor and director maximum leeway)

Example 1 Poor Dialogue Avoid in ANY Script
INT THE SUMMER HOUSE IN MALIBU OVERLOOKING THE OCEAN — EARLY MORNING

The BLUE GIRL (20 something) drags her broken leg pathetically along the black asphalt access road
A look of pain crosses her face a single tear drops from her left red eye

Being nearly 60 Blue Girl could no longer remember when a simple broken leg would slow her down
He moved away from the burning house as the family dog ran in to save the children

BLUE GIRL

Blue Girl gazed down at the ground as a worm wiggles across her path

BLUE GIRL

- Overwriting Scene Heading — ‘long winded’

- Overwriting Description — ‘long winded description’

- Inconsistency in Age of Blue Girl — ‘60 instead of 20 something’

- Inconsistency in Gender of Blue Girl — ‘he instead of she’

- Passive Character - not saving the kids — ‘family dog saves children’
- Pointless Confusing dialogue — ‘I’m missing my’

- Cliché and Meaningless to the story — ‘the early bird catches the worm’

(Kathy’s response is On-The-Nose and Chit-ChatSmall Talk — It’s boring)

Not Breaking Up Action
The easier you make it on your reader the more likely they come away from your script with a
favorable impression

break up your action lines into a maximum of four lines before inserting a blank line

white spaces (blank lines) are your friend

if possible start a new paragraph with every further action
Why Large blocks of text are both intimidating and likely to be skimmed over

Example 1 Not Breaking Up Action Avoid Large Blocks

INT APARTMENT — DAY

TOC

(it’s hard to focus and comprehend everything on a single read because of the density of the writing
— there’s a tendency to skip over or skim through the lines)

‘How To Train Your Dragon’

You Don’t Make Place A Character

A sense of place should be treated as a separate character Where the story takes place is important
People that live in the sleepy farmland of Kansas are different than those that live in Santa Monica
California Location matters Be imaginative

Why Ifa placelocation captures the imagination then the readeraudience becomes more engaged
in the story Generic locations are boring

Example 1 You Don’t Make Place A Character Boring
FADE IN

EXT AVERAGE TRACT HOUSE —- DAY

(this does not engage the imagination of the readeraudience — it’s impossible to imagine because

TOC

there is no such thing as an average home and average city)

Example 2 You Don’t Make Place A Character Interesting
FADE IN

EXT MALIBU CLIFF HOUSE — DAY

(this is more like it — Malibu an exotic location around much of the world — and a house hundreds
of feet above the surf sounds fascinating)

You Don’t Write All The Dialogue A Character Can Hear

If a character is ‘on the phone’ in a scene the reader needs to know what that character is saying
Likewise if there’s a TV and a reporter is talking and your character is engaged with it you need to
provide all the dialogue Yes there is background noise the indistinct chatter of others in public
places You don’t have to write that in But you do have to write in anything in which your
protagonist or character is engaged and would therefore hear in the real world

Why The director and actors need lines to read That’s the job of the screenwriter

Example 1 You Don’t Write All Dialogue A Character Can Hear Poor

INT SALOON — NIGHT

(if we know what the men are talking about then we need to hear the conversation in dialogue)

You Don’t Connect With The Protagonist

A readeraudience wishes to root for the main character (protagonist) or at least connected to have
empathy (understanding their motivations)

(eg There was a movie in 2010 called ‘College’ a poor imitation of ‘Animal House’ It got 5 on
Rotten Tomatoes Our main protagonist (male) in a scene drinks beer off another frat’s butt Well
from the ratings it appeared most people had trouble connecting with the protagonist after that)
Why Nothing is more boring than having no interest in the protagonist’s story

TOC

Your Opponent Shouldn’t Only Be The Environment

An audience prefers the antagonist to be a person or creature The environment can play a secondary
hardship

(eg an excellent example of combining the two is ‘The Revenant’ where the harsh winter is a
backdrop to the brutality of the people as our protagonist encounters Exceptions where the
environment is the main opponent would be ‘The Martian’ or ‘127 Hours’)

Why Most conflicts in the real day to day world is with other people That is what is familiar to
people

You Use ‘CUT TO’ In Spec Script
These days scripts are leaner than in the past One way to accomplish this is to jettison elements that
are redundant CUT TO is one of these since each SCENE HEADING’ accomplishes the same
thing
See Transitions
Why Traditions change and ‘CUT TO’ is no longer used as vigorously as it was in the past

Example 1 You Use ‘CUT TO’ In Spec Script

INT RESTAURANT DENIASEIS —- EVENING

A waiter escorts Gabriel and Alena to a secluded table They enjoy each other’s company over wine and
a good meal

After ’The Gypsies’ jam session Gabriel and Alena raise their wine glasses and invite the band over to

join them

EXT PLAZA DE TOROS STADIUM — DAY

EXT FALCON’S VILLA — PATIO — MORNING

Eva and Falcon enjoy breakfast Manuel serves them Eva on a laptop shows Falcon the previous events
closing ceremony

EVA
Lin-Lu’s vault was the most original thing
there Not even an honorable mention

Falcon shakes his head

(you could save lines and convey the same meaning by leaving out all the ‘CUT TO’)

Scene Begins Too Early
In earlier movies we’ve seen a character hang up the phone walk out the door get in his car drive
down the street get out of the car walk up to the door knock and finally enter the building Today’s
movies eliminates all the boring parts that don’t contribute to the story Now a character would get
off the phone a moment later they’d kick in the door across town Audiences of today know the
character had to get to the building and they fill in the blanks
Why Because we have all seen hundreds of movies in the modern era we are much better at
connecting the dots and making assumptions about what must have occurred preceding the opening
of a scene Enter scenes at the latest possible moment and still maintain clarity

Example 1 Scene Begins Too Early Boring Parts of Scene Included

INTEXT BAR —- DAY

Example 2 Scene Begins Too Early
INTEXT BAR —- DAY

Tim slides his hand across the satellite map to a white house across town He grabs his car keys
EXTINT WHITE HOUSE —- DAY

Tim kicks in the front door and punches out the OLD LADY

(we understand that Tim had to get across town and unless something unusual happens in the trip we
don’t care to see it)

TOC

You Don’t Run Spell-Check

If a writer can’t be bothered (too lazy) to run spell-check the reader will start believing the writer
would also be too lazy at putting together a compelling story And will quickly find an excuse to
stop reading Correct spelling is basic A typo immediately takes the reader out of the story and
diverts the reader from the quality of the writing and start them thinking about what other problems
exist with the script

Why Checking spelling is the easiest thing a writer can do to show they care about the quality of
their writing It’s a simple leap of thought that if the reader is too lazy to correct spelling they
almost certainly have far more significant problems in their script

Example 1 You Don’t Run Spell-Check Poor
INT HOUSE-DAY
John moves slowly toward the front door Barking at his heels is Mr Finch

JOHN
Don’t worry boy you’re coming with me

The dog springs into his master’s arms

(the misspelled words would cause a reader to cringe before they chucked the script into the trash)

Antagonist Isn’t Tough Enough
The antagonist must appear to be more powerful with more powerful minions and have an inherit
advantage over the protagonist otherwise there is no suspense at the coming confrontation and no
need to invest emotionally in the protagonist because we aren’t worried about himher losing The
readeraudience should believe there’s no chance for the protagonist to defeat the antagonist

(eg The latest Sci-Fi ‘Godzilla’ has a Godzilla which you actually feel sorry for and are rooting for
him over the protagonist and those aligned against him because you know Godzilla can be killed —
in one of the original Godzilla movies Godzilla had an impenetrable force field around him that
made him indestructible)

Why If your antagonist isn’t more powerful than your protagonist then the readeraudience might
start rooting for the antagonist and then feel unsatisfied if the antagonist loses

Antagonist Doesn’t Believe He’s The Hero
The antagonist never believes he’s the bad guy He sees himself as the knight in shining armor
defending a passionately noble belief
(eg ‘The Shawshank Redemption’ the warden wants order in the prison His problem is he’s a
sadist ‘The Thing’ just wants to live and get out of Antarctica — the problem is it wants to do it by

TOC

killing everyone at the research station ‘Zootopia’ assistant mayor Dawn Bellwether wants prey
to get respect — the problem is she wants to exterminate everyone in her way)

Why If your story has an antagonist that can be viewed as a hero then it’s possible to have a shift by
the readeraudience for the antagonist to become the protagonist

Antagonist Doesn’t Have His Own Speech

We learn from his speech that he is the passionate hero in his own story It should be compelling
enough for us to relate to him if we were in his position

(eg In ‘The Last of the Mohicans’ Magua is the antagonist — he’s cunning and vicious and has a
burning hate for Munro and his family — as an antagonist we’re terrified — he wants to hack to
death Munro’s daughters — if that was his only motivation we’d have no feelings for him — but
when asked why he hates the Grey Hair he says he wants to eat his heart before he dies — and he
wants to put his daughters under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever —
wow Interesting he doesn’t answer the question — he sounds like a bloodthirsty savage — finally
later he has his persuasive speech explaining his hatred — we see huge scars on Magua’s back and is
asked who did it — Magua deliberately and slowly reveals this story — his village had been
destroyed and his children had been killed by the English — Magua was enslaved by Indians who
fought for the Grey Hair and finally worst of all Magua’s wife thought he was dead and married
another man — all this because of Grey Hair — awesome I’d want to kill Grey Hair and take
revenge on his family myself Now to many Magua’s a multiple dimensional sympathetic character
and his conflict with the protagonist is more layered)

Why If we can relate to the antagonist and have sympathy for his circumstance we have a more
powerful story that brings out the reader’saudience’s emotions

Characters Do Stupid Things

In real-life situations there are things that no human would do in their right mind

(eg if a person had a chance to be armed with a gun or rifle when they are being stalked by killers
or zombies they’d grab an available weapon — or if you have the other person dead to rights and
you have a weapon you wouldn’t drop the weapon to fight the other person especially if they had a
knife or weapon — the antagonist is holding a knife to a loved one and you have a gun pointed at
him and he wants you to drop the gun or he will kill the loved one and you drop it rather than
shooting him in the head — the protagonist is in a duel but he waits for the antagonist to draw first)

NONSENSE It shows the story is mindless dribble and the writer lacks the imagination to make the
story work Amazingly there are plenty of movies of this ilk made every year

Why It drives the readeraudience crazy when a character does something that no one in their
situation would do

Minor Characters Are Stereotypes

No character no matter how minor should be a stereotype Filled out minor character will raise the

TOC

level of your script All supporting characters should be distinctive and easily separated
Why When a readeraudience encounters a stereotyped character they gloss over the character
They want a character that is more intriguing and original

You Worry About Structure
The number one thing the writer should be concerned about is to tell a powerful compelling original
story If you do this you will most likely find it conforms to a commonly accepted pattern That’s
because of how people process stories But if it doesn’t then so be it If it’s compelling it matters
not whether or not it conforms to a form others believe makes a great story
Why The only important thing is to tell a compelling story

Time Is Not Running Out
Using a time constraint in your story — a deadline a ticking clock a moment that must be met etc —
is a great way to naturally raise the stakes in the story and for your characters It’s also an easy way
to add urgency suspense momentum and ensure your story is quickly and correctly paced

(eg Touching the Void is an example of creating urgency by putting a time constraint on our
protagonist reaching base camp after a traumatic injury before he starves to death freezes to death
his partner leaves the base camp for civilization hundreds of miles away or before his will to
continue fails — also in ‘The Poseidon Adventure’ we have a sinking ship that will soon drown
everyone)

Why Putting a time constraint on a story always adds tension and suspense to your story

Example 1 Time Is Not Running Out
EXT CLIFF FACE — DAY

JOHN
Too much stress

(a time-critical event that will kill out protagonist in a few seconds)

Not Enough Emotion

Pack your script with plenty of emotion that the readeraudience feels Focus on the scenes that are
meant to express emotion and milk them Never miss an emotional moment

TOC

(eg In Throw Momma From the Train Billy Crystal’s a writing teacher and his most annoying
student is Danny DeVito — Invited for dinner and feeling obligated to go all Billy Crystal wants to
do after an awful dinner is leave He and we can’t stand Danny DeVito — after Mom has retired
Billy thinks he’s out of there — but Danny convinces him to stay a moment longer to view his coin
collection — they get on the floor and Danny pulls up the carpet and from under the floorboards he
retrieves a rusty tobacco tin — we all hate Danny so we’re not impressed when he opens the tin and
pours out ten coins on the floor — a bunch of ratty dimes quarters and nickels — what a bunch of
crap we think until he picks up a coin and shows it to Billy — Danny starts to tell about the coins as
he reverently picks up each in turn — “This one here I got in change when my dad took me to see
Peter Paul and Mary — and this one I got in change when I bought a hot dog at the circus — my
daddy let me keep the change — he always let me keep the change” Wow We have a completely
different feeling for Danny for the rest of the movie)

Why We watch movies and read fiction to evoke emotion

No Outline

Yes I often hear about how a screenwriter says they don’t use an outline When I first started I
didn’t either I just jumped in and started writing After all I had an idea for a good beginning and a
great ending and ideas about the middle The problem was that after writing scenes with dialogue I
was reluctant to erase scenes when I thought up a better twist to the story because of all the time and
effort I’d spent on dialogue and action When I finally started writing an outline I included a rough
short action paragraph for each scene and very little or no dialogue As I progressed through the
outline I could quickly delete move and create new scenes without concern at all the time I’d
wasted on the actual script This freed up my creativity to fashion the best story my talent would
allow

See Outline

Why You write an outline so you can get the story down and see if it makes sense Also so you
don’t have to come up with better story threads since you will work them out in the outline

Everything Seems To Be Going Good
Just when everything seems to be going well disaster strikes No matter what good things happen to
our protagonist calamity should always be around the next bend
Why If things are going well then there is no conflict and no suspense Both of which the
readeraudience crave

(eg In the opening scene of ‘The Thing’ a crazed Norwegian with a rifle takes potshots at the
Americans After he’s killed and everything returns to normal the dogs are attacked by the creature
sending everyone into a panic In ‘Alien’ a creature attaches itself to a crew member who
miraculously appears to recover when they find the creature dead — In the next scene everyone is
joking and having their last meal before going into hibernation when the crew member has a fit of
coughing — a few moments later an Alien rips open his chest sending everyone over the edge In

‘Avatar’ Jake Sully is enjoying the forest while Grace and her team is conducting research on the

plant life — suddenly he’s confronted by a herd of giant creatures — when he appears to have them
under control a giant predator decides Jake would make a nice meal and scared out of his mind Jake

TOC

takes off with the creature in pursuit In ‘Eye in the Sky’ it looks like this will be a routine drone
strike on a cell of terrorists that appears to be planning a massive attack all good until a little African
girl shows up next to the terrorist’s compound to sell bread — now there is suspense and conflict as
one group wants to still bomb and risk killing the girl and another group wants to rescue the girl)

Story Threads Don’t Connect With Main Story
The story’s subplots don’t affect your main storyline Why have subplots if they don’t tie into the
main story It will just irritate the readeraudience and waste pages Subplots should only exist if
they can enhance the main storyline They can run parallel but somewhere near the story’s climax
they must meet and the subplot must be found to be relevant to the main story
Why Because if a subplot doesn’t connect in a meaningful way to the main story the
readeraudience feels cheated And asks themselves why the writer even had this subplot Then it’s
straight to the trash or the audience walks out of the movie with a sense of disappointment

(eg In ‘Armageddon’ Bruce Willis opposes the relationship between his daughter and his top
crewman Ben Affleck — he does everything possible to stop it yet in the end when Ben is willing to
sacrifice himself Bruce realizes that Ben will be the best husband for his daughter and sacrifices
himself so their relationship can continue In ‘Contact’ Jodie Foster’s close relationship with her
father is revealed and when she finally encounters the aliens so she won’t be traumatized they reveal
themselves in the form of her father In ‘Gattaca’ Ethan Hawk has always been haunted by and
driven by the fact that his genetically superior younger brother was more loved by his parents — in
the end and he proves to his brother that even without superior genes his grit and focused will is
more important than what comes out of a test tube)

You Don’t Hide Exposition
Exposition is information that the writer needs to convey to the readeraudience so the story makes
sense but in real life people would already know this information It disrupts the story when this
information is conveyed So exposition must be hidden as best as possible

See Exposition
Why Because it makes the readeraudience cringe if they notice it

Ways to make exposition less noticeable

hide in an argument

hide inside a joke

making it not sound like exposition but later reveals critical information needed for the story

You Don’t Withhold Surprises Until Last Moment
Today’s innovative storytelling is on the ORIGINAL series on Netflix Amazon HBO etc What
makes many of these shows riveting is the characters reveal just enough information to keep the
audience wondering why they are doing what they’re doing who they are in relation to the
protagonist sometimes who is the protagonist etc The readeraudience doesn’t need to know
everything until the critical moment

TOC

Why The readeraudience wants to engage in the story being told One way for them to do this is to
reveal clues or have them fill in their own answers about why and what’s happening

(eg In ‘The Sixth Sense’ it’s not revealed until very late in the movie that Bruce Willis is a ghost
When it is revealed we look back on the clues and feel wonderful — it was said M Night
Shyamalan wanted to reveal this at the beginning but was talked out of it which made the movie In
‘The Usual Suspects’ the identity of Keyser Sze is only revealed at the very end)

Scene Isn’t Worked Enough
A scene should do one or more of these
advance the story
Increase dynamic tension

reveal character

entertain

make us curious

cut to the bone

start late and end early

setup the next scene

not be boring

make us interested in the character’s internal conflict

Not Enough Reversals
A reversal is looked on as an unexpected surprise that takes place You set your readeraudience up
to expect one thing and deliver something else that surprises them but still makes sense within the
context of the story
Why Readersaudiences like to be surprised as long as the surprise makes sense

(eg In the ‘The Wild Bunch’ our gang has just robbed a bank and barely got out with their lives
When they sit down to enjoy their hard-fought spoils and open the bags to reveal as one of the gang
members said “Washers Washers We shot our way out of that town for a dollar’s worth of steel
holes” From this we understand that this gang’s down on their luck and we feel sorry for them
because we realize they are probably incompetent which will lead to their death)

How Research Is Done
A character sometimes needs to do research perhaps look up some past events They go online or to
a library and search through old news articlesbooksvideos until they find something important
Usually boring Try to have a conversation with someone who can shed light on the information
through a colorful story or argument
Why Browsing through articlesbooksvideos are static and the yawn factor increases the longer
our characters are doing this

(eg In ‘Jeepers Creepers’ an oddball lady psychic confronts our two kids first over the phone and

TOC

then in person to tell them vital information that will affect their lives and about the demon that
stalks them)

Too Much Talk On The Phone

If possible it’s always better to have a conversation face to face in movie scripts

Why There usually is more potential for conflict in face to face confrontation Just think of
yourself If you want to minimize conflict you talk over the phone and avoid a face to face
confrontation

(eg you are going to break up with an abusive boyfriend — do you confront him in person No you
confront him over the phone to be safe — only if you want a confrontation do you confront them face to
face)

You Don’t Make Every Scene Memorable
Take it scene by scene and ask yourself how you can use this scene to increase the suspense
characterization or storyline Ask the ‘what if question Implement a few of the more interesting
ones and you’l see your imagination start to come up with other even more interesting plot lines
Why By practicing thinking out of the box you will get better at it You will think of clever plot
twists and you will gain the confidence you can take any scene and transform it into something
special

(eg critiqued a friend’s generic horror movie — irritated at how unimaginative it was I was
determined to show my friend how I could amp up the tension and horror — when I gave him my
analysis he was very polite but told me he only was interested in creating a generic horror movie —
rejected I asked myself a ’what if’ — what if I created a new movie around the interesting gruesome
ways of death I’d created — from this came PETA - People Eating Tasty Animals and in the
different scenes I kept asking the ‘what if to continue making it better)

Characters All Sound The Same

make each voice consistent

each characters dialogue must sound unique

make each character memorable

Why Ifall characters sound alike it’s difficult to relate to them because nothing differentiates them

Memorable Character Voices In Cinema

the calm piercing insight from Hannibal Lecter in ‘Silence of the Lambs’
the cold mechanical words of Schwarzenegger in “The Terminator’

the dark words of Darth Vader in ‘Star Wars’

the cold steel words of Daniel Crag’s Bond in ‘Casino Royal’

the sarcastic words of Bill Murray in ‘Ground Hog Day’

or any of the following ’The All Time Top Movie Voices’

TOC

You Try To Direct The Film
As a screenwriter your only job is to tell the most compelling original story you can It’s the job of
the director to DIRECT and with the Cinematographer to determine the CAMERA SHOTS It’s the
actor’s job to determine how to say their lines It’s the Costume Designer to determine what the
actors will wear It’s the composer who’ determine the music

You Try To Do More Than Write The Best Story You Can

Why To make a movie requires hundreds and sometimes thousands of people working together off a
blueprint created by the screenwriter Giving the different EXPERTS in each of their specialties room
to interpret your script allows them maximum creativity Don’t hamstring everybody by directing
everything And the most important reason not to direct a film is that it irritates the
readerdirectorinvestor actoretc

Dialogue Not Worked Enough
Another word for boring or cliché or overused dialogue
Why Boring dialogue (everyday speech) and clichés we’ve heard hundreds of times disengages the
audience for a moment from the story If disengaged too often or for too long a time and the

audience moves on to something else
See Dialogue

Characters Don’t Speak Subtext
Most poorly written screenplays only have Chit-Chat and On-The-Nose dialogue which makes them
boring and destined for the trash The hidden meaning beneath the words (Subtext) is what real
people talk about and we find interesting in great scripts
Why People love a mystery Subtext is mystery because the audience has to be engaged to
understand what is behind the words They feel they are solving a mystery Everyday Chit-ChatOn-
The-Nose dialogue puts people into a coma
See Subtext

Writing Is Confusing
Make sure the reader clearly understands your story’s vision
It’s a problem if

You Have Too Many Characters
It’s hard to remember too many characters if they are introduced close to each other or if there are
just too many of them If you have more than main NAMED characters you might think about
combining characters Usually the fewer characters the stronger your screenplay The greater the
number of characters the more chance of dilution in emotional investment Fewer characters allow
you to develop each to a greater degree If more than about 8 start naming them in relationship to
other NAMED characters

TOC

(eg ALENA’S MOTHER GABRIEL’S FATHER MARCELO’S GIRLFRIEND FALCON’S
ASSISTANT etc)
Why Go to a party of strangers and get introduced if you are like me you will not be able to recall most if

not all their names when you go home No audience wants to have to remember character names

You Obscure Your Character’s Identity

later

Most of the time you want to reveal your character’s identity the moment they are introduced If not
it usually means one more character the reader has to keep track of until they are properly introduced
Why It’s always better to immediately associate a character with a name if they have one
otherwise the reader has to go to extra effort juggling information that they need to attach to a name

You Assume We Understand The Character’s Motivation

Unless given clues by previous behavior the camera cannot capture the inner thoughts of the
character to know why they act as they do It has to be led up to in dialogue or previous action
Why By giving early clues in dialogue or action about how a character behaves it won’t come as a

shock when they do an action or says a line

Format Confusing And Not Standard

It seems that this would be obvious But most screenplays I’ve come across seem to think their
clever fonts pictures additional statements non-standard Scene Headings parenthetical directions
bold italics underlining etc shows how creative the writer is It Does Not It irritates the reader and

gives them an excuse to send your script to the trash

For Correct Formatting See Scene Headings Secondary Scene Headings Action
Characters Parentheticals Dialogue Transitions

Why A reader only has so much time to devote to reading a screenplay If they get bogged down
with anything non-standard it will piss them off and they will think you are a moron

Scene Headings Done Wrong

Remember that after a Scene Heading you ALWAYS have an ACTION BLOCK before anything
else such as DIALOGUE or CHARACTER
Why This is what the reader expects It sets the scene

See Scene Headings Secondary Scene Headings

Example 1 Scene Headings Done Wrong Wrong

INT CAFE — NIGHT

BILL
This doesnt’ seem right Judy

TOC

(there MUST be an action block before the character speaks)

Example 2 Scene Headings Done Wrong Correct
INT CAFE — NIGHT
Under the table Judys foot slides down Bill’s leg

BILL
This doesnt’ seem right Judy

(the action block gives us some idea of what’s happening and is mandatory)

You Over Direct Actors
Don’t give us every movement the actor makes in a scene Give them a lot of leeway to improvise
and show their talent Plus all your over directing will be ignored and make you look like an
amateur
Why It wastes lines that could be used in developing the story or character and is likely not be done
as written

Example 1 You Over Direct Actors Little Leeway

INT CAFE — NIGHT

BILL
This doesnt’ seem right Judy

(too much detailed direction — this will only irritate the reader and any potential actor)

Parentheticals Incorrect

See Parentheticals

Changed Character Names
Keep character names consistent If in one scene a woman is called ‘YOUNG NURSE’ don’t switch
her name in later dialogue or action to ‘NURSE’
See Character

TOC

Example 1 Changed Character Names Incorrect
INT HOSPITAL ROOM — NIGHT

The YOUNG NURSE removed the bedpan from beneath the bed

JEFF
What are you doing

The Nurse glanced toward the door and poured the bedpan onto Jeff
(this confuses the reader because there could be another character called Nurse other than the Young

Nurse)

If all of Judy’s friends in dialogue call him Phoenix you call him Phoenix
Why The readeraudience balks if they associate a character with one name and then another name
is used They must do extra processing to make the connection

Example 2 Changed Character Names Incorrect
INT CAFE — NIGHT
The waiter drops a greasy burger onto the table

JUDY
All that lard’s going to kill you Phoenix

BILL
At least Ill die happy

(the reader is now not sure why Bill is speaking — this is confusing to the reader — Bill is Phoenix)

Example 3 Changed Character Names Correct
INT CAFE — NIGHT

The waiter drops a grease burger onto the table

JUDY
All that lard’s going to kill you Phoenix

TOC

PHOENIX
At least Ill die happy

(the reader now knows who Judy is speaking to and who is responding to her)

Too Many Characters Have Names
From the moment the reader starts in on your script they want to make a connection with the
introduced characters If a character doesn’t have a real name they know they don’t need to connect
to them If you start naming minor characters you will both confuse overload and irritate the
reader One way to avoid confusion is to number your unnamed characters
Why A readeraudience only can remember so many names If a character is given a name they are
assumed to be relevant to the story If they are immediately killed off or disappear from the rest of
the script then don’t give them names

Example 1 Too Many Characters Have Names

FADE IN

EXT ALLEY — NIGHT

ROBERT and BOB in their early twenties move to cut off JEFF’S (30s) retreat

JEFF
Out of the way you assholes

Jeff pulls a gun BLAM BLAM The two would-be robbers drop dead

JEFF
Two less dirtbags to worry about

(Robert and Bob should have been named something like THUG 1 and THUG 2 since they play
such a minor role in the movie — throw away names reminds the reader not to focus on them)

Character Names Are Confusing
Y Don’t have characters that begin with the same letter The reader will get confused especially if
names have a similar number of letters

(eg Dan and Dave Judy and Julie Arthur and Andrew Bill and Bob Jeff and Johnathan

Connie and Carol Tim and Tod)
Y Don’t have names rhyme

TOC

(eg Willy and Billy Ted and Fred Bobby and Robbie Vinnie and Bennie)

Why You want to make it as easy as possible to differentiate characters so the reader doesn’t have
to flip back and forth to different pages to remember who a particular character is If they do they
will lose the flow of the story

See Character

Protagonist Not Described Meaningfully
v try to leave out race height weight hair color eye color etc
vif possible be vague on the age (ie ’30s is better than 34 — older or younger actor thinks they
can play 30’s maybe not 34)
Y do reveal character in action
Why If given an image of a character and how we would expect him to behave we aren’t shocked
at what he does which appears to match hisher character

Example 1 Protagonist Not Described Meaningfully Poor Description
INT GAMESHOW —- DAY

(the reader has no image of what to expect from this character)

Example 2 Protagonist Not Described Meaningfully Good Description
INT GAMESHOW - DAY

ARTHUR BELL (40’s) America’s favorite game show host charismatic with a withering wit used to
put contestants in their place moves with a flamboyant style to the mic He scrutinizes each of the
contestants

(the reader now knows what to expect from Arthur)

Example 3 Protagonist Not Described Meaningfully Poor Description
INT GAMESHOW — DAY

(the reader doesn’t know anything about Arthur’s personality only a physical description — more
importantly what actors match Arthur’s physical description)

TOC

You Don’t Read Your Script Out Loud

v It’s amazing how a script sounds different when read aloud

Why Reading out loud is an effective approach for improving your writing You can pick up on

the rhythm of the dialogue and whether it sounds right A kind of music that captures the
readeraudience and drives the story forward

Personal Experience I’m always fascinated at what sounds alright in my scripts when quietly read
often reveals shortcomings when read aloud

You Show Characters Inner Thoughts
¥ You can only write what the camera can see The camera is not a mind-reading machine Unless
through Voice Over dialogue which reveals character and what the character is really thinking

Note The voicing through (VO) of inner thoughts should normally be avoided since film is a visual
and auditory experience

But Inner Thoughts Can

v lighten a scene - A person holding back sarcasm or humor may present a blank face to the other
characters but may reveal his true self to the readeraudience

thoughts and lectures to one’s self allow insight into a character

allow characters to be differentiated

gives characters an honest voice

reveal character’s motivation

slows the pace of a scene

LLL LLK

can reveal inner conflict
To Convey Inner Thoughts

Y the character must be the viewpoint character for the scene
Y only reveal thoughts and inner dialogue that advances the plot

See Dialogue

Why The Camera does not have psychic ability and can’t see what’s in someone’s head
Example 1 You Show Characters Inner Thoughts Not Possible
EXT GRAND CANYON - DAY

As Tarl ran down the trail he thought of the time in the Marine Corps when he ran down the slopes of
Mount Everett

(the Camera can capture Tarl running down the trail but has no clue as to what he is thinking)

Example 2 You Show Characters Inner Thoughts Good

TOC

Grinning widely she hops around like a little girl until they are all flying

INSIDE THE LINK -- Jake’s eyes open in the darkness He doesn’t know where he is He weakly
pushes open the lid blinking at the light
JAKE (VO)

TIGHT ON AVATAR JAKE silently drawing his bow his eyes focused in intense concentration A beat
-- the arrow flies

JAKE PULLS the arrow from the twitching body of a hexapod He dispatches it with his knife

(reveals Jake’s character — he is confused about how he now views the world — but nothing specific
which the Camera would not know about — often with dialogue written in italics)

‘Avatar’

Example 3 You Show Characters Inner Thoughts Good

INT RESTAURANT — NIGHT

Andrew and Wallace huddle around the table immersed in conversation Wallace notices the waiters
covering the tables around them

The waiter delivers the bill to the table

WALLACE (VO)

INT TAXI — NIGHT

Wallace rides in a taxi looking out at the city

TOC

(from an inner conversation in ‘My Dinner With Andre’ we see two different ways to show inner
thoughts in dialogue — first is (VO) and the second where all the dialogue is in italics)

Example 4 You Show Characters Inner Thoughts Not Possible

INT BAR — NIGHT

Jeffs gaze falls on the girl Jennifer approaching He felt hot Could she know how much I want to bed

JENNIFER
Youre Jeff aren’t you

Surprise crossed Jeffs face Was she in one of my school classes last semester

(can’t have inner dialogue in actiondescription lines)

Example 5 Inner Thoughts Possible
INT BAR — NIGHT

Jeffs gaze falls on the girl Jennifer approaching He felt hot

JENNIFER
Youre Jeff aren’t you

Surprise crossed Jeffs face

(we have inner thoughts by resorting to Voice Over)

TOC

You Use Versions Of ‘To Be’
“To Be” in any of its forms represent Passive Voice Screenplays are ALWAYS written in Active
Voice and Present Tense Go through your script and rewrite all Passive Voice to Active Voice
Why Passive Voice does not convey action

See Voice (Active and Passive)

Example 1 You Use Versions Of ‘To Be’ Passive and Past Tense

EXT STADIUM — DAY

The men have waited outside the batting cage and are ready for batting practice John is standing at the

plate He has anticipated a fastball

(this is weak since each sentence is in Past Tense andor Passive Voice)

Example 2 You Use Versions Of ‘To Be’ Active and Present Tense

EXT STADIUM -— DAY

The men stand ready for batting practice outside the batting cage At the plate John anticipates a
fastball

(rewritten in Active Voice and Present Tense — sounds more powerful)

You Don’t Remove ‘the’
Ifa sentence still makes sense and reads well remove any the’s
Why Often ‘the’ is a filler word that conveys no extra meaning and can be removed

Example 1 You Don’t Remove ‘the’ Poor
EXT DUNES —- DAY
As the ATV tore up the hill the sand flew and the tires spun as the passenger fell over the cliff

(delete the bold the’ s to improve readability)

You Don’t Carefully Look At Spelling Of Every Word ‘homophones’

Why Make sure the correct word is used in every occasion

Example 1 You Don’t Carefully Look At Spelling Of Every Word Poor

TOC

EXT SAVANA - DAY
The pray moves through the grass Hands went for there rifles Then the bare attacked

(these words would have passed spell check but were inappropriate in each sentence

pray - prey
there - their
bare - bear)

You Don’t Remove ‘We see’ and ‘We hear’

Why ‘We see’ and ‘We hear’ are both from an audience’s point of view and takes the reader out of
the story

Note Some professional writers use these terms but they take up space and they have a chance of
disengaging the reader It is weak writing

Example 1 You Don’t Remove ‘We see’ and ‘We hear’ Poor

ALADDIN
Nice goin’ Abu Breakfast is served

Aladdin and Abu on the roof break open the melon and eat We see Jasmine walking through the street

(takes us out of the story — even good movies sometimes get lost in weak writing)
‘Aladdin’

Example 2 You Don’t Remove ‘We see’ and ‘We hear’

Aladdin
Nice goin’ Abu Breakfast is served

Aladdin and Abu on the roof break open the melon and eat Jasmine walks through the street

(changed to Active Voice — less words — more dynamic)

You Don’t Remove ‘that’

If a sentence still makes sense and reads well remove any that’s for improved readability
Why Often ‘that’ is a filler word that conveys no extra meaning and can be removed helping
readability

TOC

Example 1 You Don’t Remove ‘that’ Poor
INT CLASSROOM - DAY
On the blackboard the Writing Teacher puts up an example
WRITING TEACHER
This is the first thing that I tell writers to get rid of There are
two kinds of that’s — ones that you need and ones that you
don’t When you delete a that re-read the sentence and see
if it still makes sense If it does you didn’t need it if it doesn’t

you did What do you think about that

(delete “that’s” to improve readability)

You Don’t Remove Anything That Ends In ‘ly’

You can get rid of almost any adverb in your writing adverbs weaken writing because they detract
from what’s being said It’s one more unnecessary word that bogs down the narrative and when it’s
overused can jolt a reader Keep your reader immersed in the story
Why Adverbs ending in —ly weakens the sentence by watering down the impact

Example 1 You Don’t Remove Anything That Ends In ‘-ly’

EXT STADIUM —- DAY

Batter ran quickly toward first base then suddenly ground to a stop as the ball rapidly shot foul

(the use of —-ly adverbs weakens the impact of this narrative)

Example 2 You Don’t Remove Anything That Ends in ‘-ly’
EXT STADIUM —- DAY
Batter ran toward first base then ground to a stop as the ball shot foul

(usually fewer words in a sentence improves clarity)

You Don’t Remove ‘really’ ‘very’

These are useless modifiers You should be able to find stronger verbs or adjectives for whatever

TOC
you’re trying to enhance
Why Often ‘really’ and ‘very’ are filler words that convey no extra meaning and can be removed
helping readability
Example 1 You Don’t Remove ‘really’ ‘very’ Remove Words That Don’t Contribute
He ran very quickly along the really long trail
(sounds awkward and weak)
Example 2 You Don’t Remove ‘really’ ‘very’ Shorter and Clearer

He broke into a sprint down the long trail

(sounds better and is shorter which usually means greater clarity)

You Don’t Remove ‘just’
Why ’just’ is often filler word that conveys no extra meaning and can be removed helping
readability

Example 1 You Don’t Remove ‘just’ Remove Words That Don’t Contribute To Meaning

Tam just totally spent after racing the marathon

(removing just sounds better and is shorter which usually means greater clarity)

You Don’t Remove ‘down’ Or ‘up’
These words are often connected to a word that implies one of these words
Why Carefully think of the meaning of the words you write Often ‘down’ or ‘up’ are filler words
and can be removed

Example 1 You Don’t Remove ‘down’ Or ‘up’ Remove Redundant Words
John stood up as Mary sat down

(remove ‘up’ because you can only stand UP — remove ‘down’ because you can only sit down)

You Don’t Remove ‘then’ Or Replace With ‘and’

When showing a sequence of events either remove ‘then’ or try using ‘and’ instead of ‘then’

TOC
Using ‘then’ frequently sounds repetitive and simple
Why ‘and’ conveys the same meaning ‘then’ can be removed because it doesn’t add any extra
information
Example 1 You Don’t Remove ‘then’ Or Replace With ‘and’ 1 Poor

John shut the car door then tripped over the sidewalk Then everyone broke out in laughter

(then’ refers to coming after another event — but screenplays take place one sequential event at a
time in Present Tense so it can be removed)

Example 2 You Don’t Remove ‘then’ Or Replace With ‘and’ Better
John shut the car door and tripped over the sidewalk Everyone broke out in laughter

(sounds better replacing the first then and removing the second one)

You Don’t Remove ‘totally’ ‘completely’ ‘absolutely’ ‘literally’
These words don’t add information to a sentence
Why Often ‘totally’ ’completely’ ’absolutely’ and ‘literally’ are filler words that convey no extra
meaning and can be removed helping readability

Example 1 You Don’t Remove ‘totally’ ‘completely’ ‘absolutely’ ‘literally’ Poor

The box literally completely overflowed with absolutely totally fantastic clothes

(sounds better by removing ’totally’ ’completely’ ‘absolutely’ and ’literally’)

You Don’t Remove ‘starts’ ‘starting’ ‘begins’ ‘beginning’
These words are unnecessary since screenplays take place in the NOW
Why ‘starts’ ’starting”’ begins’ and ‘beginning’ are words that show the start of an action But
screenplays take place in the NOW with one event following the next So these words aren’t needed
and removing them helps readability

Example 1 You Don’t Remove ‘starts’ ‘starting’ ‘begins’ ‘beginning’ Poor
INT CAFE —- DAY

The band begins to play jazz as the audience starts to dance

TOC

(all action takes place in the now)

Example 2 You Don’t Remove ‘starts’ ‘starting’ ‘begins’ ‘beginning’

INT CAFE — DAY

The band plays jazz as the audience dances

(less words more immediate action clearer)

You Don’t Remove ‘rather’ ‘quite’ ‘somewhat’ ‘somehow’

Why Often ‘rather’ quite’ somewhat’ and ‘somehow’ are filler words that convey no extra

meaning and can be removed helping readability
Example 1 You Don’t Remove ‘rather’ ‘quite’ ‘somewhat’ ‘somehow’
The movie was rather dull and the party after quite boring

(don’t equivocate — remove rather and quite)

Example 2 You Don’t Remove ‘rather’ ‘quite’ ‘somewhat’ ‘somehow’
The movie was dull and the party after boring

(don’t equivocate — remove rather and quite)

impressed She modified the opening scenes to create tension and resubmitted the book They

loved it and bought it By projecting confidence that I could help her she took my advice and used her
skills to get the sale

You Get Excited If Someone Says They Like Your Script
The interesting thing about most people is they don’t want to make waves They will say almost
anything to avoid an argument or tell you what they really think It’s called Subtext

If The Person That Reads Your Script Doesn’t Say Something Similar To This Your Screenplay sucks
To Avoid This Give Them Your Tenth Draft — Never Your First
Why If people see mistakes in your script they will balk at carefully reading it

You Don’t Think Of The Words You’re Writing

‘is’ is Passive change all sentences to Active (eg ‘He is running ’ - ‘He runs”)

‘are’ is Passive change all sentences to Active (eg ‘The kids are singing ’-‘ The kids sing’)

‘then’ She giggles She then jumps in the pool (eg She giggles She jumps in the pool’)

‘walk’ Jane walks across the floor (eg ‘Jane prances across the floor’)

‘sit’ Sitting at the poker table Bob deals the cards (eg ‘At the poker table Bob deals’)

‘stand’ The pool shark stands at the billiard table —(eg At the billiard table the pool shark works his
magic’)

‘look’ Jane is looking at Ann (eg ‘Jane studies Ann)

‘of the’ Tom sits by the entrance of the mall (eg ‘Tom sits by the mall entrance)

‘begin’ The music begins playing eg ‘The music plays”)

‘start’ He starts moving toward the den (eg ‘He moves toward the den’)

‘really’ Kathy is really beautiful (eg ‘Kathy hot as a summer night)

‘very’ The boys sing a very old song (eg ‘The boys sing a traditional song’)

‘-ly’ (at the end of adverbs) Remove the —ly adverb and find a more powerful verb

Why You need to capture the imagination of the reader with powerfully written action

You Don’t Put Most Important Word At End Of Sentence

A rule in writing is the most important words are at the end of a sentence and the most important
sentence is at the end of a paragraph The power of a sentence comes at the end Have your
readeraudience leaning forward into the words as they come out wondering until the last word
Why The reader remembers the last words in a sentence best

Example 1 You Don’t Put Most Important Word at End of Sentence Poor

TOC

MR JONES
Well That’s all You may expect swift litigation
on behalf of the airline

(the airline is not the important word)

Example 2 You Don’t Put Most Important Word at End of Sentence Powerful

MR JONES
Well That’s all On behalf of the airline you may
expect swift litigation

(litigation is the important word — it will make a chill run up them)

You Use Numbers Instead Of Words In Dialogue
You want actors to say numbers the way you wish them to sound Because of this numbers need to
be written out Not as crucial in actiondescription
(eg 135 can be said as one thirty-five or one hundred and thirty-five or one hundred thirty-five but
written as words you inform the actor precisely what you wish them to say)

You Use Specific Songs

See Music and Lyrics and Poetry
Why As referred to in the link You don’t know the cost of licensing a song and that is not the

writers job

Your First Page Isn’t Awesome
A good reader does not need an entire script to know if a person can write The first page will either
capture the reader or have them looking for an excuse to trash the script

The most important page of your script is that first page In that page you need to draw in and intrigue
the reader with the promise of an emotionally rewarding story The worse thing a writer can do is bore

and not connect with the reader The reader will put it down

The first page primary job is to convince the reader to turn the page To do this

° have a question that the reader needs answering — mystery
° reveal something unexpected - unexpected
° give the reader a reason to care - empathy

What the reader should learn from that first page

° introduce protagonist andor antagonist - who are we going to root for or against
e connect with the genre - horror sci-fi comedy action drama etc

TOC

° clarify the story world - where and when does the story take place

° introduce conflict - conflict equals emotions — draw out reader’s z
emotions

e set the tone - sarcastic suspenseful dark humor etc

° correct formatting - correct use of screenplay elements

° spelling and punctuation - check every sentence for spelling and grammar

° write in ‘Present Tense’ and ‘Active Voice’ - don’t write ‘Past Tense’ and ‘Passive Voice’

° imaginative word use - don’t use boring repetitive common words

° good use of white space - don’t intimidate with dense writing

° promise of an emotionally rewarding story - characters do actions and dialogue that connect

° original action and dialogue - don’t write what we’ve seen or heard before

° can reader follow the story - don’t write a confusing convoluted narrative

° no lazy dialogue - no small-talk no clichés no on-the-nose dialogue

° avoid repetition of words - replace common words with original replacements

° don’t bore the reader - write every line to excite and engage the reader

If you accomplish these then the reader will continue reading

You Don’t Keep Dialogue Out Of Scene Description

Never put dialogue which the character(s) can hear in action If the words are indistinct they belong

in the actiondescription

Why Words spoken only belongs in dialogue

Example 1 You Don’t Keep Dialogue Out of Scene Description Incorrect

INT LIVING ROOM — NIGHT

John rushes in and Maria asks where he’s been

(Maria’s speaking dialogue — it has to be put in dialogue tag)

Example 2 You Don’t Keep Dialogue Out of Scene Description Correct

INT LIVING ROOM — NIGHT

TOC

John rushes in and Maria confronts him

MARIA

(Maria confronts John with real dialogue)

Example 3 You Don’t Keep Dialogue Out of Scene Description Correct

EXT STREET — NIGHT

(the noise the Rioters are making is indistinct and belong here in action)

You Don’t Care About Image Order In Scene Description
When a person reads your scene actiondescription they begin to form a series of images of what’s
occurring in the order that they are reading them You must make sure to give them in the order that
makes sense

(BAD 1 During the robbery John’s wallet was taken and he was tied up and shot) So did the
robbers first somehow get his wallet then decided to tie him up and then shot him Or more likely
did they first shoot him tie him up and then take his wallet Each conveys a different series of
images

(CORRECT 1 During the robbery John was shot tied up and his wallet was taken)

(BAD 2 John and Kathy race speed boats on their jet skis) So was John and Kathy such great
swimmers that they could race speed boats wait they are on jet skis)
(CORRECT 2 On their jet ski’s John and Kathy race speed boats)

(BAD 3 The drone released its JOAM bombs as it descended to five thousand feet) So I don’t
have an image of the altitude until the end

(CORRECT 3 The drone descended to five thousand feet and released it’s JDAM bombs) Now I
have an image of the drone descending to an altitude and releasing its payload

Note This also applies to Scene Headings

(BAD 4 INT LIVING ROOM — ESTATE HOME — DAY) The correct order is from Larger to
Smaller or General to Specific
(CORRECT 4 INT ESTATE HOME — LIVING ROOM - DAY)

TOC

Why Make sure each event follows in correct understandable order

You Don’t Shorten Scene Description

As atrule less is better Long rambling descriptions are for novels There we need these descriptions

because they arent a movie with images In a screenplay the scriptwriter needs to convey the

minimum to paint an image of the scene All the details will be filled in by others And unless you

are writing prose which you can’t do in a screenplay less description is usually clearer

Y replace short scenes that follow consecutively by placing them into a montage or series of shots
This will save on Slug Lines Scene Headings

Y substitute long words for short ones This can save on lines if these long words cause sentences
to run onto a new line A thesaurus will prove invaluable for this purpose

Why The first thing a reader does is glance at the ‘Title’ page to see if it looks correct Second they

turn to the last page to see if it is greater than 120 pages — if greater than 120 the reader is thinking

this writer is an amateur

You Repeat What You Just Told Us

Don’t repeat what you just told us in a Scene HeadingSlug Line
Why It wastes linespages that could be used to further develop the story and makes the writer look
like an amateur

Example 1 You Repeat What You Just Told Us Incorrect
INT BAR — NIGHT
Jim staggers into the bar He’s drunk

(from the Scene Heading we already know we are in a bar)

Example 2 You Repeat What You Just Told Us Correct
INT BAR — NIGHT
Jim staggers in drunk

(shorten the action line because we know he’s in a bar from the Scene Heading)

You Repeat In Dialogue

Why It wastes linespages that could be used to further develop the story and temporally disengages

TOC
the
reader for a moment because they already have heard these words
Example 1 You Repeat In Dialogue Incorrect
EXT RIVER —- DAY
Toes over the edge Jean looks down eighty feet to the water

JOHN
Don’t look down

JEAN
Now you tell me

(Jean already looked down and in dialogue she basically repeats a variation on John’s remark)

Example 2 You Repeat In Dialogue Correct
INT RIVER — DAY

Toes over the edge Jean looks down eighty feet to the water and a tremor runs down her leg John nods
support

(with the tremor we know Jean’s nervous — John’s line was a cliché so removed it)

You Rewrite As You Write Your First Draft
While you are writing your first draft there is a tendency to jump back to make changes to earlier
lines in your script because it is less stressful than the original thinking your plowing through Never
go back no matter how bad your original words were They are a place holder for the countless
rewrites you will have AFTER your first draft is complete If you start going back to improve your
previous words — You will never finish your script
Why After the outline (Zero Draft) your goal as a writer is to quickly get the skeleton of the First
Draft down so the creative process can begin

You Tell How A Character Feels Instead Of Showing Feelings

Why By showing how a character feels you draw the readeraudience into actively participating
because they come to their own conclusion about why a character is acting the way they are

Example 1 You Tell How A Character Feels Instead Of Showing Feelings

TOC

EXTINT HOUSE — NIGHT

JOHN
Oh God Never again

(doesn’t take a rocket scientist to guess that John is very drunk and sick and he doesn’t want to repeat
this again)

Example 2 You Tell How A Character Feels Instead Of Showing Feelings Poor

EXTINT HOUSE — NIGHT

JOHN
I don’t want to ever drink again

(not as visual — doesn’t have the same impact as having the readeraudience come to their own
conclusion that he is drunk in scene 1)

First Dozen Pages Isn’t Awesome

When it comes to screenwriting you only have so much time so many pages so you don’t have the
luxury to meander and this is especially true in your first dozen pages You must maximize script
economy and move the story forward immediately because you’ve only got about a dozen pages to
accomplish a few major components

The below analysis demonstrates what’s important in the first dozen pages of your script for the reader
to want to continue reading

black — what’s important

blue —why

red —what was achieved in the first dozen pages of the example script (using ‘PETA — People
Eating Tasty Animals’ script)

Make An Emotional Connection With The Protagonist And Other Main Characters

¥ Make an emotional connection
if we can’t connect emotionally with a character then we don’t care what happens to them — they are not
real to us and what happens to them doesn’t matter to us - they are no more connected to us than a rock
—and your story is dead Our characters need to be interesting and do interesting things

TOC

we re endeared to Alan (Protagonist) and dislike Gary (Antagonist) and his brother Robert (Antagonist) —
we also established the Protagonist and Antagonist(s)

In What World Does Your Story Take Place In

When does the story take place — future modern period piece etc

the reader wants to know as soon as possible when in time does the story take place - these are normally
clues which the reader hones in on — if the writer isn’t clear enough and the reader guesses wrong they
are irritated and blame the writer for their confusion

we ve established ‘PETA’ takes place in modern times because the giant ‘London Eye’ Ferris Wheel
was built in the year 2000

What physical location — where are we — what country at sea outer space etc

the reader wants to know what physical location the story takes place in This is done by clues that again
the reader must often interpret in the actiondescription (ie ‘Paris Café’ ‘overlooking the crescent
Earth just rising’ ‘nothing but a gray sea as far as the horizon’

we see the story starts in London England and moves to Las Vegas USA

Paint a picture of where we are
so we can visualize our location

we visualize London in opening scenes and view the lights of Vegas as were flying in

Did any event in the story recently take place that propels the story forward
every James Bond movie has an amazing opening sequence that tells the reader that they are in for an
exciting adventure ride

opening credits suggest the horror genre — the introduction of Alan on his bicycle (Protagonist) merges
in the comedy genre

Introduce The Main Characters

How do we relate to the characters - our first impression Why should we care about them What
defines them What’s their gender What’s their age What special traits set them apart Keep their
description concise but enough to visualize them

the reader wants to connect as quickly as possible with each character introduced and how they figure
into the story — the first is through their name if given a Proper Name then the reader assumes they are
significant and immediately looks for other clues so we can relate to them — such as their gender age
special qualities or talents These ideally are given to the reader in the actiondescription block when the
character is first introduced There’s few things that pisses off a reader more than finding a dozen-plus
pages later that the character that they thought was a man turns out to be a woman or that a character the
reader assumed was twenty turns out to be in their seventies The final way to relate to a character is by
the actions and dialogue they use — ideally the dialogue would be unique for each character Also
readers don’t like to wander through large blocks of character description or spare description that
reveals nothing interesting about the character (eg The MAN was handsome (boring))

we re given the Protagonist’s and Antagonist’s gender age and personalities when they are first
introduced and their traits are supported by their actions and dialogue

Establish The Genre

TOC

Make it clear so we can adjust our expectations on how the story might unfold

when a person goes to the movie they already know what genre they are to expect because they have
read the logline and probably seen the trailer But if a reader doesn’t know they get clues from the title
and opening pages They need to be oriented to the genre(s) as quickly as possible to see if the story
matches the genre expectations (by a dozen pages - comedy sci-fi action drama romance fantasy etc
or combination

opening credits suggest horror and Protagonist’s initial introduction suggests comedy

Create Conflict
quickly draw the reader into the story Often referred to as ‘the inciting incident’

have some significant event happen that leaves a question with the reader that they wish to discover the
answer to Don’t have any scenes that would bore the reader to death

the terrorist attack on London in opening pages establishes conflict and the Protagonist indirectly
killing the Antagonist’s brother might be considered the inciting incident

Introduce A Mystery
Introduce questions that the reader wants answers to

have some event happen or dialogue which leads to a series of questions the reader desperately wishes to
know the answer to

throughout the opening pages questions arise at what will happen when the Protagonist meets
Antagonist — one being how the Protagonist can prevail over a ruthless killer

Create Suspense
Have the reader worry about what is about to happen

suspense is the state of being excited anxious andor uncertain about what may happen - worry equals
suspense - the reader usually knows as much or more than the reader

in almost every scene I’ve introduced suspense questions about what might occur later — Robert often
looks at his watch — Robert letting a family board the capsule before him

Create Your Unique Voice
Show the unique personality of your characters in action and dialogue

each writer has a unique stamp of how they convey a story their writing style which captures the
reader’s attention and imagination — (ie dry humor irony sarcastic just the facts etc)

action lines are short and to the point — dialogue is also short and to the point — no small-talk very little
on-the-nose dialogue

Introduce The ThemeMessage You’re Trying To Advance
What is the core story about

have an event take place early that demonstrates the theme of the story

TOC

the core story is developing the theme ‘the power of luck’ — the Protagonist winning the contest - having
the Bobbies show up just in time to protect the Alan — the other side of being lucky is bad luck —
Robert’s truck and himself exploding in fire — Robert’s hand being blown off just as he’s about to kill
Alan - being shot by Constable before he could strangle Alan - Gary locking himself out of the car and
cutting his hand - Gary not being able to kill Alan because the Bobbies show up

What point are you trying to advance

have the reader quickly interpret what idea you want to put across

being lucky trumps being smart

Connect The Story To The Logline
Does the story appear to match up with the logline the reader read

if the reader read the logline they are curious if what they read so far agrees

a dozen pages in weve established the genres horror and comedy and PETA connection
Give the reader what they signed up for

make sure your story conveys the genre(s) that the reader is expecting

horror — opening credits the explosion in London - Roberts hand blown off - Robert burning to death —
comedy — Alan on his bicycle blocking traffic - Alan’s goofy behavior

Use Proper Formatting Spelling And Grammar
Show the reader you know what you are doing Nothing is worse than sloppy spelling grammar or

failing to follow the accepted screenwriting rules

the reader is always looking ways to skim through the screenplay — bad spelling and grammar tells the
reader that the story is probably also sloppy and therefore can be ignored

I used Grammarly (httpgrammarlycom) to check my spelling and grammar —I went over the script
MANY times looking for errors — I found new errors every time I looked —I got others to read my script

because they found errors I missed

Avoid Overwriting
Don’t bury the reader in massive blocks of action or dialogue

a reader can only digest a few lines (max 4) at a time before it starts getting confusing and they start
skimming - if a reader doesn’t soak in every single word then you are beginning to lose them

I kept the action blocks and dialogue to a minimum — I believe the director actors and choreographer
will handle the micro details of action and might come up with unique dialogue that fits the actor

Make ‘white space’ your friend
to keep the reader from being temped to skim action lines break them up often with ‘white space’ blank

line between action - dense text invites the reader to skim which disconnects the reader from the story

TOC

I didn’t write large blocks of action without breaking them up with ‘white space’
Make it an easy read

an easy read usually consists of short active sentences Usually one idea per sentence - there’s a rhythm
to the words - low number of abstract words

I made the story an easy read by keeping the sentences short and in Active Voice —I also kept Small-
TalkChit-Chat ExpositionInformational and On-The-Nose Dialogue to a minimum

Don’t Be BORING - Seize The Reader’s Emotions
Force the reader to care about what’s happening and promises of what will happen

if you have fascinating characters which are constantly surprising you by their dialogue and action then
you can pretty much forget all the rules — a reader wants to follow them around to see what they’ll get
up to even if it deviates from the storyline

I tried to have the reader connect strongly with the Protagonist by Alan’s zany actions

Don’t bore the reader with ordinary people doing tedious dull things that don’t advance the story and
encourages the reader to skip over or quit reading

avoid any dialogue or action we’ve seen before - avoid Small-TalkChit-Chat - keep
ExpositionInformational dialogue to a minimum - avoid On-The-Nose dialogue that the reader can
predict - use a lot of Oblique and Subtext dialogue

none of the characters do boring things or have boring conversations

When it comes to screenwriting you only have so much time so many pages so you don’t have the
luxury to meander and this is especially true in your first dozen pages You must maximize script
economy and move the story forward immediately because you’ve only got about a dozen pages to
accomplish a few major components

establish the tonegenre (eg is this a comedy fantasy spoof etc)

introduce your main character interesting flawed and if not likable at least empathetic somebody
we can hope and fear for

clarify the world of the story and the status quo

indicate the theme or message (Good vs Evil Man vs Nature etc)

set up the dramatic situation — that is what the story is going to be about

Note There is no absolute order in which these guidelines are applied
Why The longer you wait to capture the reader the greater the chance they will gloss over or stop
reading your script

Haven’t Cut Unimportant Action
As youre figuring out your story in the first draft to understand the logic connecting each scene
you’d write a scene of a person getting into a car driving to a destination walking up to a door

TOC

knocking on the door and waiting until the occupant answers On the rewrite you’d have the
protagonist kicking in the door without all the run-up Always work on how to shorten a scene and
convey the same meaning

Why You want to remove scenes that the readeraudience can figure out without showing them that
doesn’t confuse in the telling of the story

You Think Your First Draft Or Tenth Draft Is Perfect

When I finish a draft I often marvel at how well it was written But if I put the script away for a few
days not only do I find spellinggrammarpunctuation errors but dialogue I thought was wonderful
now annoys me If your words don’t rot after a few days then select a scene or sequence and tell a
friend you think something’s not right with it and ask them to help you figure out what it might be
They will have little problem finding fault with your perfect words EVERY SCRIPT CAN BE
IMPROVED - ALWAYS

Why You are competing against thousands of other scripts to be noticed Don’t let someone find a
shortcoming and give them an excuse to stop reading your script

You Don’t Know The Meaning Of Every Word
Look up EVERY WORD and see if there is a better word that more appropriately conveys what you
are trying to impart to the readeraudience
Why There are subtle meanings in words that are listed as synonyms The right word can be the
difference between boring and inspiring

Characters Are Cliché

These are a few of the characters that make me wonder

in action and dialogue antagonist’s minions appear to have the IQ of roadkill
antagonist monologues on so the protagonist can figure out how to turn the tables
antagonists are totally despicable

characters only speak in Clichés Chit-Chat On-The-Nose dialogue

Y characters only do tired old actions we’ve seen a hundred times before

SNL A

Why People want to see and hear new variations of action and dialogue If your characters act as above
then they are boring

Scenes Are Purposeless
Every scene should have a purpose Ask if a scene either
hows character
defines the character’s world
advances the story
is a critical moment in the plot

LLL NA

helps to clearly define the character’s objective
v isat least entertaining
Why The two-hour format of movies can’t be wasted by scenes that don’t’ have one of the above
reasons A purposeless scene not only confuses but irritates the readeraudience

TOC

Your Spec Script Is Too Long
Depending on the genre your script should be between 90-120 pages NEVER LONGER After
looking at the cover page every reader will then flip to the last page and if it’s over 120 pages you
have pissed off the reader and if they bother reading it at all they are now looking for reasons to
toss it

Why Readers get irritated if a script goes beyond 120 pages

You Dont Write Every Day
You need to immerse yourself in your writing The reasons are
¥ you need those 10000 hours to recognize your potential as a writer That’s years of constant
writing
v by writing every day your story is always fresh in your head
v by saturating yourself in a story your subconscious imagination kicks in to come up with clever
dialogue and action — See Creativity
Why Your skills increase the more you practice

You Don’t Unleash The Emotions In ActionDescription
You can turn actiondescription into a compelling character Though you can’t include things that
can’t be seen by the camera EMOTIONS that the actoractress emotes can be seen by the camera
and whatever can transfer emotions to the actor are valid

Example 1 You Don’t Unleash The Emotions In ActionDescription Correct

EXT PATIO — NIGHT

Ava watching her realizes its from Caterina’s room stares in horror at her daughter

actresses’ mind — a greater range of interpretation)

your script takes place later than the one that preceded it If LATER is used then there needs to be an
indication that time has passed

Example 1 Later Correct
INT NIGHT CLUB — NIGHT

Gabriel stares mesmerized at Alenas sensuous movements

INT NIGHT CLUB — LATER

Gabriel dances to the music of ‘The Gypsies’ while Alena drinks a beer and laughs

(same location but later in time)

Example 2 Later Correct

INT NIGHT CLUB — NIGHT

Gabriel stares mesmerized at Alena dancing

Gabriel dances to the music of ‘The Gypsies’ while Alena drinks a beer and laughs

(or simply write a Secondary Scene Heading — PREFERRED)

Example 3 Later Incorrect

INT CAFE — NIGHT

Gabriel stares mesmerized at Alena dancing

EXT CAFE —- LATER

TOC

Gabriel dances to the music of ‘The Gypsies’ while Alena drinks a beer and laughs

(cannot use LATER because the scene takes place in a different location — went from INSIDE to

OUTSIDE)

Common Dialogue Clichés

A cliché is something we’ve either seen or heard many times We all hear these in movies so they must

be a good thing No they are not Unless you have a new angle on the use of these avoid them They

tell the readeraudience that I couldn’t come up with anything original so I’ve fallen back on a tired

phrase that you’ve heard a hundred times and will for a moment disengage you from the story

Here is a small list of common dialogue clichés we’ve all heard which make our dialogue boring There

are many more and you will recognize them when you hear them (don’t use any of these or there

variations or the thousands of others If you’ve heard it before don’t use it)

How To Write A Screenplay Synopsis

A synopsis is a short one to three-page description of the key points of a screenplay in Present Tense

and double spaced

Note Some believe it should be longer But people don’t enjoy reading anything that looks like it might

be work Some think the synopsis should be in Past Tense

A screenplay synopsis summarizes a screenplay for a reader such as an agent director actor or

producer If the reader likes the synopsis he or she may ask to see the screenplay Unlike a treatment

which is a narrative of everything that happens in a screenplay a synopsis includes only the most

important or interesting parts of the story

A synopsis must clearly show the necessary elements of the screenplay so the reader will know that you

understand how to structure a script for a movie It should show the ending to see if the story makes any

sense

Note Some believe you shouldn’t show the ending I think you should show

the ending People want to know what they may be buying and if your ending makes sense

Introduce the main characters and setting in one paragraph Include the names (who) their occupations
(what) where they live and work (where) the time period of the story (when) and the reason you are
telling their story (why)

Type the names of the characters in all capital letters the first time their name appears After that type
the character names in the usual way

Characters that should be included in the synopsis are the protagonist (hero) the antagonist (villain) the
love interest and any important allies of the protagonist Less important characters can be left out or not

TOC
named in the synopsis

Give your synopsis to other people to read If they have any questions or if something isnt clear to them
change your synopsis to make the story clearer

Sample Synopses

Synopsis 1 ‘A Handful of Stardust’ (Sci-Fi)

Synopsis 2 ‘Tar’ (Sci-FiHorror)

Synopsis 3 ‘Courage’ SuspenseDramaRomance)
Synopsis 4 ‘Between The Lines’ (Romantic Comedy)
Logline

The logline is about 25 words or at most two sentences that sum up your screenplay You can think of
the logline as the description you might read on the website of a movie theater or in the information box
of the program guide on your television

Telephone Conversations
e Telephone conversations can be tricky Set up the first location with a brief scene such as the caller dialing
the phone then set up the second location such as the recipient picking up the phone While still at the
second location add the action element “INTERCUT with” followed by the caller’s location all on the
same line above the caller’s first speech in the scene To clarify that a character is talking on the phone
place the parenthetical direction “(into phone)” under the character cue Telephone Conversation 1

e You may not wish to show both sides of a telephone call but remain focused on one character In such
scenes it’s rare in the cinema for us to hear the other party Insert a parenthetical “beat” when that character

is listening and reacting Telephone Conversation 2

e If on the other hand we must hear both sides of the conversation then the unseen character’s cue would
have a “(VO)” extension and the parenthetical direction “(over the phone filtered)” Telephone
Conver sation 3

e Ifonly one party is seen and heard treat it like other dialogue with pauses or beats or actions to break up
that character’s dialogue and indicate when the other party is talking
Telephone Conversation 4

(we only hear and see Clara in the telephone conversation)

Example 5 Telephone Conversations Correct

(you’ll need a Parenthetical (or a separate action line) if the character is speaking to someone on-
screen and on the phone at the same time)

Example 6 Telephone Conversations Correct

(we only hear one side of the conversation)

Note Chemistry between leading characters is generated onscreen when they’re in the same scene the
same room the same frame of film That is the preferred interface between two characters because
phone calls are boring to watch they typically bring the plot to a screeching halt as Character A dumps

Sounds

Sounds - and by sounds I mean every sound including music and even silence - play an important role
in bringing your story to life Sounds are used to enhance a script reading experience and get the
reader’s attention to what’s important Sounds that enhance the script are capitalized

What Sounds to Capitalize

° dialogue consists of the actual words spoken by the character Any other utterances are just
sounds and should be written as in the narrative description (action) Sound 4 or in a separate
secondary scene Sound 2 heading but NEVER in parentheticals Sound 5

e animal sounds their barks meows etc are NEVER in dialogue but in actiondescription or
Secondary Scene Headings Sound 6

° if the sound is essential to tell the story you can emphasize by capitalizing Sound 5

e capitalize sounds if you want to make sure the reader ‘hears’ it If it’s unimportant don’t

° capitalize if the sound isn’t visible on camera Sound 3

e don’t need to capitalize if the object making the sound is clearly visible Sound 1

Which Word(s) to Capitalize to Emphasize the Sound

Depending on the experience you want to leave the reader with you may want to emphasize - and
therefore CAPITALIZE

° the source of the sound (eg THE GUN)

° the number of sounds heard (eg TWO SHOTS)

° the effect of the sound (eg the car SHATTERS the door of the phone booth)

e a combination of above

If the sound is important but NOT critical to the scene you might put the sound in the
ActionDescription Sound 4

If the sound impacts the scene or increases the dramatic tension you might put in its own Secondary
Scene Heading Sound 2

Review each sound effect and determine if it contributes to your ActionDescription If not leave it out

Note Caution Do not clutter your script with meaningless capitalization of every little squeak and
squawk in your Spec Script it distracts the reader It takes away the emphasis on a capitalization you
want the reader to notice because it’s important

In a SPEC SCRIPT I remove most of the Sound Capitalization because I wish the reader to notice
any word that is capitalized as important In the shooting script I would put in Sounds because they
are needed for the Sound technician (ie If too many sounds or words are capitalized you have
diluted their impact — only capitalize essential words)

TOC

Example 1 Sounds Correct

EXT GARAGE - DAY
Chigurh grabs the air hose

CHIGURH
I need you to step out of the car sir

The man opens the door and emerges

MAN
Am I

Chigurh reaches up the mans forehead with the end of the tube connected to the air tank

CHIGURH
Would you hold still please sir

A hard-pneumatic sound The man flops back against the car Blood tickles from a hole in the middle of
his forehead

(we clearly see Chigurh holding the air hose so we don’t need to hear the sound unless it enhances
the script-readin g experience)

‘

No Country For Old Men’

Example 2 Sounds Correct
EXT JUNGLE — NIGHT
The Teen’s naked feet pound the hot wet earth as he sprints through the maze of trees Flecks of

tightens with dread and the SHOUTS of his pursuers hammer his ears

INT STAGE — NIGHT
The Host grabs the microphone and scans the audience

HOST

(only human speech is in dialogue — Benji’s Barks are in an action line — John and Angie’s sounds
are also in action lines — only their speaking is in dialogue)

Music and Lyrics and Poetry

Music can be a way to reveal important information about a character or a place and can create a mood

or atmosphere

° generally and for legal reasons - do not mention a piece of particular music in your screenplay
unless this piece of musicsong is essential to the story Music 5

° do not specify a specific piece of music or song unless you own the rights or these rights are
now in the public domain Music 1

e indicate the music genre instead (eg ROCK COUNTRY MUSIC CLASSICAL MUSIC) The
directorcomposer will take care of finding a fitting piece of music Music 4

There seems to be a lack of consensus on how lyrics should be formatted These are the variations that
appear to be acceptable

° the norm is to write lyrics in italics (acceptable normal type) Music 1 Music 2 Music 3
° when a character recites poetry or song lyrics enclose the lines in quotes

° choose to put a “” at the end of each line of lyricspoetry Music 1 Music 2 Music 3

° some start a new line at the end of each line of lyricspoetry (breaks the dialogue borders) Music
7
° some writers do both or neither

° song lyrics are typically written in ALL CAPS (no CAPS are also acceptable)
e if it’s not already clear from the context that the character is singing it’s helpful to include the
parenthetical “(singing)” the first time it comes up
Music 1 Music 2 Music 3

Example 1 Music Correct

JOHN

Example 2 Music Correct

Over the giant flat screen Elvis sings “Viva Las Vegas” Alan tosses his bag onto a cart and in Vegas
spirit he starts gyrating across the floor to the music The crowd cheers his antics Alan dances into the
customs line

(unless critical to the story you shouldn’t use a specific name unless in the public domain or you own
it)

Example 6 Music Correct

TOC

An Elvis impersonator rips a song out over the loudspeakers Alan tosses his bag onto a cart and in
Vegas spirit he starts gyrating across the floor to the music The crowd cheers his antics Alan dances
into the customs line

(this doesn’t step on anyone’s toes and sets the right mood — the music director will select the

appropriate music)

(the return between each song line the breaks the normal dialogue margins)

Silence
can be used as a sound In this scene contrasting the beating heart with sudden silence shows the
shock of suspenseful terror

Example 3 Silence Correct
EXT YOSEMITE EL CAPITAN —- DAY

Johns heartbeat keeps rhythm as he grabs the next handhold

BADOOM BADOOM BADOOM

Above his head dangles a rope from his partner He pauses a moment for breath

BADOOM BADOOM BADOOM

A rope drops from above and travels downward

JOHN

Example 7 Music Correct

JOHN

TOC
Oh shit
John’s leg shakes
BADOOM BADOOM BADOOM

(BADOOM BADOOM BADOOM represents John’s heartbeat — his heart stops then increases
stronger with exclamation BADOOM BADOOM BADOOM —The momentary silence followed by
a stronger heartbeat tells without words of John’s terror — enough to stop his heart for an instance is
revealed)

Reveal

can be used to reveal information to the reader which will help explain the scene or story better It is
used in the ActionDescription block (Normally actiondescription shows what the camera sees)

Example 1 Reveal

YOUNG JUDY
Blood blood blood

Reams of red papier-mache entrails ooze from the bunny And when those run out -- projectile ketchup

Reveal These are ANIMAL KID ACTORS The bunny JUDY HOPPS 10 is our hero And this is her
play being staged A banner reads CARROT DAYS TALENT SHOW

(Without the reveal we don’t know that these are kids in a school play being staged or that Judy
Hopps the hero and it is her play)

Title Page and More

Keep Your Title Page Simple

Nothing screams amateur like graphics colors and loud fonts Keep your title page clean minimal and to

the basics No extras Don’t write the title on the spine either

Paper Type Matters

Your screenplay title page should not have special paper— it should be white unscented 20lb weight un-

bedazzled plain white paper with your information

Use The Same Font
Courier 12 — the same font your screenplay should be in (or Courier Final Draft) font in ALL CAPS and

centered on the page approximately 18—20 spaces down from the header

The Title Needs To Be Centered

TOC

The title four inches from the top smack dab in the center of the page you need to write your title in ALL
CAPS and underline it Two lines below your title add “by” and two lines below that also centered put
your name

Note There is much leeway in this I’ve seen “written by” “screenplay by” and a few other variations

The correct is “by” but apparently variations are acceptable

What If You’re Not The Sole Screenwriter

If you collaborated with other writers youd need to list their names on the title page as well If it’s a team
of writers use the “and” sign between names If multiple writers worked independently use “and” After the
byline move down one or two more spaces (your choice) and write your name with the first letter of each
name in CAPS in 12—point Courier If you are CO-WRITING your script with someone else use an
ampersand symbol between your names (and) like “John Smith and Jane Johnson’—but do not use the word
“and” The word “and” between author names suggests hierarchical ownership of the material A name-—line
that reads “John Smith and Jane Johnson” means that John Smith is the primary writer and Jane Johnson is
a secondary writer

What If You Adapted Your Screenplay

If the writing is yours but the story is someone else’s then you need to mention that on your title page Use
“by” and list your name Followed by “Story by” and their name two lines down or “Based on the book by”
and the author’s name if it’s a book adaptation two lines down

The Great Contact Info Debate

Your contact information needs to go on the bottom—left corner for a spec with no spaces between lines
Classically this would be your name address and phone number But your email address is all you need
but you can throw a phone number in too if you want to follow the traditional rules

If I Don’t Put My WGA Info My Great Ideas Will Be Stolen True Or False

False You should leave it off Agents think listing that is a clear-cut indication of an amateur and paranoid
Don’t put WGA registration numbers on the title page (or anywhere else on the script) And while legally it
could be helpful to include a copyright notice no one ever does this

Include The Date Yay Or Nay
Don’t include a date You want your screenplay to look as new as possible whenever someone picks it up to
read

Bind It

Once your screenplay title page is done and ready to go make sure it’s triple—hole punched and bound with
only the sturdy brass brads like the ones ACCO(R) sells Flimsy versions aren’t what the professionals use
Also it’s commonly accepted that Spec Scripts only use two fasteners even though there are three holes in
top and bottom holes

Scene Numbering

the Title page has no page number

the first page of your screenplay has no page number This is the FADE IN page that begins the first

scene

the second page and every page thereafter has a page number Since you begin numbering on the second
page you start with the numeral 2

TOC

the page number always goes in the upper right margin in the top margin (ie the top header section) You
should vertically align the number in the header Since the top margin is one inch vertically align the page
number at 05

include a period or dot after the number EX 1 2 3 4 5

never boldface italicize or underline page numbers

Standard screenplay format is

Letter—sized paper 85 x 11 inches
Font 12—pt Courier

Page Margins
Left 15 inches

Right inch
Top inch

The only time Scene Headings are numbered is when a script is in production and they need to track
the scenes being shot When youre writing a script for submission do not number scenes in a film

Introducing Characters

e You Give Characters No Discernible Role
This is probably the top screenplay characterization problem EVER and usually happens because
writers are so busy trying to persuade readers to CARE about characters they forget WHY the
characters are part of the story in the first place We all hear about “differentiating characters” so
many writers spend a lot of time trying to make each one SOUND or LOOK different And this is a
good start But sounding or looking “different” does not great characterization make
Why Because great characters are what they DO Characters in your screenplay all have to DO
different things to be “differentiated”

e Characters Need A Specific Role

TOC

Protagonist Is usually “for” the “main theme” of the story

Antagonist Is usually “against” the “main theme” of the story With protagonists and antagonists in
mind it’s usually the protagonist who drives the story though sometimes it’s the other way round and
the antagonist will instead Occasionally we will have a passive protagonist (especially in the case of
the Comedy genre) Still if this happens another character (antagonist or an important secondary) will
usually give them back to the protagonist in the resolution

Secondary Characters These characters HELP or HINDER the protagonist or antagonist in their
respective missions Secondary Characters may perform roles like Mentor Second In Command
Henchman Love Interest Best Friend Comic Relief etc

Peripheral Character These guys reflect the story’s intentions andor facilitate the plot or (usually) the
main characters’ motivations in some way (or the opposite) A good example here would be characters
who are placed in the narrative simply to die as in the Horror genre or war and disaster movies
Peripheral characters don’t have to die though sometimes in Comedies and Thrillers a peripheral
character may obstruct our protagonist in hisher mission like the Official who won’t help or a Police
Officer who arrests the protagonist or turns them away

Summary
Great characters come from great stories they are inextricably linked

Great characterization makes use of back story but not at the expense of the here and now
Great characters have role functions a reason WHY they’re part of the story

Great characterization is about a character’s reactions to the situation in hand

Great characters are what they DO

x X

e Too Many Characters

Many screenplays will have a plethora of characters They need to have a reason to be present in the
narrative

e Characters Need To Relate To

v

SAKA

Plot

another character
arena (or story world)
theme

all of the above

Otherwise your characters simply float about randomly and the readeraudience can’t connect with
them Also unless each character has a specific discernable role it’s confusing to attempt to keep
track of them

There’s Too Much Tragic Backstory Up Front

This is a problem in how to inform about the back story without boring the readeraudience Instead of
humor most screenwriters DON’T play the idea as a tragic back story upfront for laughs Instead the
readeraudience must wade through stories of child abuse rejection rape bereavement self-abuse and
accusations — before the real story even gets underway Often this will mean an ocean of flashbacks before

TOC

we get on with the story HOW DEPRESSING

Massive backstories are not the answer Characters’ reactions and the way they deal with what’s
happening to them in the present tells us more than a bucket of flashbacks or expositional dialogue
about their traumatic past

e They “Back End” A Characters’ Motivations

The readeraudience doesn’t know what the characters want why they want it or when they need it
Instead we end up finding this out in retrospect As a result it’s difficult to invest in those
characters’ journeys

e Here Are the Top Ways Writers Mess Up Their Characters And Their Story

Characters are poorly introduced Your character needs to be introduced in an interesting and
dramatic way When we meet your character for the first time — especially your protagonist shehe
should be preferably DOING something that

Y tells us something about himher in terms of personality

Y gives us a sense of the story worldthe tone

Y gives us some clue or indicator about the situation at hand

Yet too often we meet characters waking up getting ready for the day ahead andor eating breakfast
coming down the stairs or from another room (usually when someone yells for them) sitting in cafes
or restaurants musing or sitting in their bedrooms doing the same BORING This is nearly always
because writers mistakenly believe that seeing a character in their home environment (or similar)
makes us CARE about them IT DOESN’T

Remember readers make all kinds of assumptions from your very first page and opening images
Make sure you introduce your characters in ways we don’t see all the time

High-Concept

People go to the movies to feel and have an emotional experience You elicit emotion by way of

conflict desire and character Emotion grows out of conflict Your characters are the vehicles of

emotional experiences The protagonist’s passion is what propels the story forward The emotional

experience comes from the obstacles your characters face

usually has a “what if” scenario High-Concept stories usually have a short evocative title
They typically have at most a two-sentence logline often 25 words or less

they are original ideas If it’s been done before it’s not High-Concept

the more significant the obstacles the greater the conflict in a story the more emotionally
involving it will be to the audience

the goal of a high concept is to lure the audience to watch by promising an emotional experience
with a story with a great deal of conflict

a story concept is a condensed statement of the plot which is another term for a logline It is
simply the idea that defines a story It is the shortest statement that states who is the hero what’s
the desire what’s the conflict

the greater the conflict the more the promise of emotion The greater the emotion promised the
greater the chance it will draw people into the movie

a high—concept story that is strong enough is without any other components It doesn’t need a
cast director execution good word of mouth or awards It is simply the story idea alone

this simply means that when a person is searching for a movie and reads the movie logline or
sees the trailer they make an emotional commitment to check it out

A movie described as being high—concept is considered easy to sell to a broad audience because
it delivers upon an easy—to—grasp idea

Low-—Concept is more concerned with character development and other subtleties complex social

issues usually a limited audience interest

Emotionally Connect

Movies are all about emotion Movies move the audience through an ebb and flow of emotions then
explodes in a huge climax But great movies move people in different ways Excitement is one of the
easy ways Fast cars bullets spaceships all evoke excitement And sometimes that works Mad Max
Fury Road The Fast and Furious series and Raiders of the Lost Ark all accomplished this fast
excitement

Infusing different emotions into a screenplay is one of the most overlooked tasks in the aspiring
screenwriter’s repertoire

Other emotions joy ecstasy anticipation anger rage admiration fear terror surprise amazement
surprise sadness loathing appreciation distraction disgust boredom contempt awe submission
acceptance trust interest annoyance optimism aggressiveness remorse pensiveness disapproval
love interest serenity vigilance admiration grief nervous anxious jittery alarmed fretful insecure
timid delight etc A palate of emotional colors that have profound effects on us as humans

These all need to be expressed by our story characters To connect with a character we should show
them at work home and play Do this with your major characters especially the protagonist and the
antagonist

To infuse your screenplay with emotion

Example 1 Emotionally Connect Poor

INT HALLWAY — DAY
John was afraid to open the door to the basement steps He stood debating what to do

(need to show how he is afraid — who would he debate with)

Example 2 Emotionanlly Connect Good

INT HALLWAY — DAY
John trembles as he opens the basement door and steps down into the darkness

(we see John is afraid by him trembling and he actively steps into the unknown darkness — the
reader audience knows he is afraid by his action — this engages the reader to interpret what they see
or read)

By 30 pages if you’ve put the reader in the character’s place in the story what touches the character can
touch the reader By the screenplay’s climax the reader should so identify with the lead character that
the character’s pain becomes the reader’s pain his triumphs and the reader’s triumphs

TOC

The reader may have a physical response - laughter or tears or shivers - as if whatever happened to the

character had actually happened to the reader

Make The Antagonist An Unsympathetic Character
Let him do things we disapprove of - lie steal cheat act poorly toward animals Give him some
positive traits as well But on the whole the reader should not fall in love with the antagonist

Show the Reactions Of Characters to Other Characters
Characters must do more than think about the evil of another character They must have a
response in terms of action andor dialogue

Always Set Things Up Before You Kill Off A Character

Don’t be afraid to let a major character die But first you must establish how we care about that
person

If John gets a phone call about his daughter’s death the audience won’t feel his grief even if you
show John grieving unless you’ve created an emotional connection between John and the
audience ahead of time showing John’s love for his daughter If his daughter has never been
mentioned and we don’t know how much he means to John an announcement of her death will
have little emotional impact on the reader But if John has shown concern for his daughter
earlier the audience is connected both to John and his daughter and her death can shake up the
reader

Kill Off Or Destroy Someone Close To The Protagonist
If the protagonist is emotionally crushed the reader can be as well

Foreshadow of What’s to Come
If the readeraudience has a foreshadowing earlier scene that suggests an outcome and now a
character (Kelly) drops dead it’ll have a more significant believable impact

Example 1 Foreshadow Good Foreshadowing

EXT UCLA EMERGENCY — NIGHT

Kelly stands by the curb As the bus pulls up and the door opens he grabs his chest and pauses a
moment to catch his breath He steps up into the bus

(shows foreshadowing at how serious Kelly’s condition maybe)

Think Of The Effects Of Actions And Dialogue On The Audience’s Emotions
Youre creating a story filled with plot character and emotion The most important aspect of
emotions by characters in your story are the emotional effects on the audience

Spec Script vs Shooting Script - Key Differences

A ‘Spec Script’ is a screenplay written without pay without any development contract or promise of

payment in place in the hopes of getting it optioned sold or gaining representation by an agent It will

undergo many changes before being made into a movie This leads to a ‘Shooting Script’ which is a

script that has been vetted changed rewritten and not being used as a blueprint for filming a movie

There are fundamental differences between the two that you must understand

TOC

The Title Page

v A ‘Spec Script’ should have the title of the movie “written by” the author’s name(s) and some
contact information (for author or agent) WGA notification is optional (ie Title Page)

v A ‘Shooting Script’ may have in addition to everything in the ‘spec script’ multiple subsequent
writers studio or producer contact information draft or revision dates and copyright notices
Do not include these additions in a ‘Spec Script’

Scene Numbers

v “Spec Scripts’ should not have Scene Numbers (If you use them while writing a script make
sure they are removed when presenting your script)

v ‘Shooting Script’ employs Scene Numbers to track the scenes being shot

Title Sequences

v “Spec Scripts’ should avoid references to opening credits or title sequences

v ‘Shooting Scripts’ can contain or reference title sequences in the finalized script The director
makes this decision

Camera Direction

v In ‘Spec Scripts’ it’s never a good idea to include camera directions (PAN DOLLY TILT UP
ZOOM INOUTON CRANE UP etc) It’s the director’s job to interpret how to shoot your
screenplay — NOT THE SCREENWRITERS JOB You can imply camera direction

v A ‘Shooting Script’ WILL have the director’s vision of how the story will be shot

Example 1 Camera Direction Avoid

CAMERA TRACKS John as he darts through traffic

(unless CRITICAL to the telling of the story CAMERA SHOTS should be avoided in Spec Scripts)

Example 2 Camera Direction Implies Camera Direction
John darts through traffic

(the director will understand that the focus is on John and will use his vision to add the appropriate
CAMERA SHOT)

The Writing

¥Y The ‘Spec Script’ is often written better and with greater clarity than the ‘Shooting Script’ because
breaking scenes into specific shots can often compromise the writing quality of the original script
Having already been SOLD scenes are now writtenrewritten for functionality over form speed over
eloquence maybe even a few typos may creep in

TOC

The original script could be a masterful piece of work A shooting script should not be a template
as to the quality you need to reach for in your “Spec Script’

Also a ScreenwriterDirector often writes their own screenplay In many of these they include
CAMERA DIRECTIONS since this will be their vision

Final Comments

¥ Write the best script you can DO NOT pick up bad habits by reading poorly written ‘Shooting Scripts’
Read as many scripts as possible

Chapter 6 Creativity

Creativity is the most essential skill needed to produce an original screenplay It will put your script
above the 999 of the scripts written It will get you noticed Creativity allows one to thrive in an
everchanging world and unlocks a universe of possibilities With creativity you see potential instead of
problems instead of obstacles you see opportunities

Creativity is characterized by the ability to perceive the world in new ways to find hidden patterns to
make connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena and to generate solutions

Facts About Creativity

v Stress and deadlines are creativity killers

v Playfulness and relaxation are creativity enhancers

v Constraints cultivate creativity - It forces a direction in which creativity can expand into
v Paradoxically if a person is given free rein to solve a problem their creativity appears to

evaporate with the person focusing on past or standard solutions

Creativity involves variability - different ways of doing things Creativity also involves
constraints which can either promote or preclude creativity

Personal Qualities Needed To Maximize Creativity

Self-assurance in the belief that your opinion has as much or more value as anyone elses

Why Self-assurance allows one to overcome doubts at submitting outrageous solutions to a problem

which because of their introduction leads to a solution A person willing to fly in the face of reason

authority and common sense must be a person of considerable self-assurance Also it’s possible they

could just be crazy

v Always question every belief you have no matter how strong you hold or express that belief

Why Strongly holding onto a belief as being true narrows the possibility of finding original solutions to

a problem

v Embrace the stress and anxiety needed to reach deeper into a story Creativity can be learned but
by its very nature of rewiring thinking patterns it causes internal stressanxiety

Why Most people avoid anxiety and only come up with the obvious and bland solutions to problems

That is why we see scripts with boring dialogue (on-the-nosechit-chatcliché) or Action weve seen

hundreds of times before

v Persistence at working on a problem as long as possible till the last moment where a solution is
needed Don’t give into taking the first couple of solutions you come up with

Why The most original solutions often come after you’ve looked at and gone through many obvious

solutions The longer you can delay picking your final solution the greater the likelihood it will be the

most original

Read As Much On Diverse Subjects As Possible
Why In many ways having knowledge of many subjects is like having multiple collaborators It allows
more cross-connections to form between knowledge bases

Creative vs Regular Thinking

ConvergentClosed thinking (the process of combining and sorting out the best ideas — learning mode
regular thinking) ConvergentClosed thinking is the type of thinking that focuses on coming up with a
single well-established answer to a problem ConvergentClosed thinking emphasizes speed accuracy
analysis and logic and focuses on recognizing the familiar reapplying techniques and accumulating
stored information

DivergentOpen thinking (the process of creating ideas — creative thinking) DivergentOpen thinking
leads to a more positive attitude (playful) and ConvergentClosed thinking leads to a more negative
mood (serious)

A video showing the importance of TIME for playfulness in creating something imaginative
‘Importance of Time in Creativity’

Words from an original thinker (John Cleese) on elements needed for creativity
‘Creativity by John Cleese’

Neuroscientist on creativity by Beau Lotto ‘Deviate’

v Creativity Is Not A Talent but a way of operating (though each of us has innate potential in the
qualities that contribute to creativity)

Creative people can get in a particular mood — CHILDLIKE PLAYFULNESS

People function in two modes Open (Divergent-Creative) and Closed (Convergent-Regular)
Creativity is not possible in the Closed mode

SNL A

Closed mode (Convergent) is the mode a person is generally in when we are learning — it is
accompanied by a feeling that there is a lot to be done and little time to do it It has a slightly
anxious feeling Tension and impatience usually accompany it It has little humor It is
purposeful It’s your normal learning mode

v Open mode (Divergent) is relaxed expansive looking at the broader view less purposeful We
are more contemplative and more inclined to humor and therefore more playful It’s a mode
where curiosity for its own sake can operate because we are not under pressure to get a specific
thing done quickly

v When the feeling of being pressed or anxious comes about one should stop step back and think
of something else unrelated to dissipate the anxiousness Once relaxed one may once again
return to the playful Open mode

v One needs to be in the Open mode when pondering a problem but once a solution is decided on
one must switch to the Closed mode to implement it For only in the Closed mode are we
efficient at implementing an agreed-upon solution

v Once a solution is implemented we again should enter the Open mode to creatively evaluate the

solution In the Open mode we now search for a better solution based on our new understanding

TOC

How To Enter The Creative DivergentOpen Mode

v Space — you need to create a space where the normal daily pressures won’t affect you You
should seal yourself off from regular interruptions

v Time — you need a minimum amount of time in which to allow your mind to relax and wander
(Several hours)

v Time Working On A Problem — Don’t settle on the first couple of solutions It’s easier to do
trivial things we know we can do than complicated things we aren’t sure we can do Anxiety
arises when we don’t think the solution is the best we can come up with Learn to handle this
anxiety and push through to more in-depth solutions Slowly enter into the Open mode by doing
trivial things that allow your mind to wander until your creativity kicks in Gently keep bringing
your mind back to the problem then moving off the problem This allows your powerful
subconscious to contemplate a solution

v ConfidenceSelf-assurance — Must have a feeling that any solution NO MATTER HOW
SILLY is not the wrong direction You can’t be PLAYFUL if you are worried about making the
wrong decision You cannot be spontaneous within reason You must allow yourself to be
unreasonable in your thoughts Solutions do not need to make sense You also must believe in
yourself that there are no problems you can’t solve else when you get stuck your anxiety level
will quickly rise and strangle any creative thoughts

v Humor — One is relaxed when one is in a playful mode This relaxation allows the
subconscious to come into play

Why Through humor the logic which usually constrains one’s thinking disappears and helps one think

‘out of the box’

(ie when a person is confronted by traumatic events a person often resorts to humor to allow
themselves to come to grips with the event)

v Trust Your Subconscious — Your subconscious is not restricted by prejudicesbeliefs about the
world that we all have while using our conscious mind This ignoring of beliefsprejudices opens
up greater pathways to possible solutions and cross-connections that the conscious mind with its
prejudices won’t make Trust that your subconscious mind will come up with an answer if you
put in enough pondering time on the problem

Why When we are awake we have assumptions and rules we live by about the world that we take into

account You may have noticed when asleep (subconscious) we are in the unconscious dream world

where there are no restrictions on what is possible In this world it seems perfectly reasonable to fly or
carry on conversations with talking animals which makes little sense in the real world when awake

(ie assumptions that most people no longer believe to be true the world is flat the sun revolves around
the earth ghosts exist spontaneous generation microscopic bacteria doesn’t cause illness facilitated
communication with autistic children — these beliefs were proven wrong by individuals that didn’t

TOC

believe in the currentlogical world view at the time because their subconscious wasn’t bound by the

prejudices of the day)

The Art of Collaboration

is when more than one person works together on a project

v

v

v

Collaboration helps seed a greater range of creative ideas as long as no one in the group makes
another member feel defensive

A group of people normally inhibits creativity since creation is embarrassing For every new
good idea you have there are thousands of foolish ones which you naturally do not care to
display

A collaboration of people may be desirable for reasons other than the act of creation itself No
two people exactly duplicate each other’s mental information One person may know
information A and not B another may know information B and not A and by suddenly knowing
A and B one may get the original idea C

The information may not only be of individual information A and B but even of combinations
such as A-B which in themselves are not significant However if one person mentions the
unusual combination of A-B and another the unusual combination A-C it may well be that the
combination A-B-C which neither has thought of separately may yield an answer

The purpose of collaboration is not to think up new ideas but to educate the participants in facts
fact-combinations and theories

For collaboration to work there must be ease relaxation and a general sense of permissiveness
People should encourage each other to come up with silly ideas

The world in general disapproves of creativity and to be openly creative brands you as slightly
weird Even to speculate openly is somewhat bothersome Individuals in collaboration must have
the feeling the other members approve of their crazy speculations

If a single collaborator is unsympathetic to playfulness creative thoughts dry up An apathetic
individual may be a gold mine of information but heshe destroys creativity

All people in collaboration must be willing to sound foolish and listen to others sound foolish
If a single individual present has a much higher reputation than the others or is more articulate
or has a distinctly more commanding personality he may well take over the group and reduce
the rest to little more than passive obedience The individual may himself be extremely useful
but he might as well be put to work solo for he often neutralizes the rest

The optimum number of a collaborative group should be small Probably no more than 2-4 A
larger group might have a larger total supply of information but there would be the tension of
waiting to speak which can be very frustrating It would probably be better to have several
meetings at which the people attending would vary rather than one session including everyone
This would involve a certain repetition but even repetition is not in itself undesirable It is not
what people say at these meetings but what they inspire in each other later on

Maximum creativity mode has a feeling of informality friendliness joking and playfulness

Collaboration In Practice

I recently started a collaboration with ‘Jan Moran’ a very talented novelist to create a promotional

screenplay for her latest book ‘The Winemakers’ She and a few of her actor friends hoped to use it to

TOC

present to investors and producers to raise funds to create the entire movie What follows is the steps we
used to maximize our collaborative creativity

v I carefully read the book

Why To evaluate if it was a project I was interested in participating in And to assess the writing skills

of my potential collaborator I found the story exciting and original

v Thad discussions with the author and interested actors in an informal (dinner) atmosphere

Why To see if I could get along with the author To evaluate her flexibility of thought and her ability

for humor It is a waste of everyone’s time if personalities don’t match

v Had a frank discussion about what was expected (length of the script number of actors involved
location of filming method of marketing etc)

Why Get a feeling for everyone’s commitment to the project and to evaluate the project’s scope

v We created an acceptable outline that would act as the starting blueprint for the script

Why Most time is wasted by not having a clear roadmap to start the actual script By creating an outline

before the actual script is written it allows one to work out may of the logical bugs Also in this case it

helps the collaborators to be on the same page

v I decided to work face to face at an agreed-upon location instead of through Skype or email

Why I find it’s easier to judge a person’s emotions and get a sense of how they are reacting to ideas if

you are in direct contact It’s also faster and better to step back and forth between Divergent and

Convergent thinking which is needed for effective creativity

v We agreed to meet 2-5 hours each time several days a week

Why One of the requirements for maximum creativity is to have enough hours to effectively activate

Divergent thinking

v We sat either side by side or facing each other with only a single computer which we shared

Why This allowed maximum interaction and evaluation of how each reacted on both a verbal and non-

verbal level at the other’s reactions to suggestions

v Before each writing session we set up a sense of relaxation and playfulness by asking about each
other’s day telling jokes or talking about how we hoped the project would turn out

Why One of the most essential requirements to activate Divergent thinking is for all parties to be

relaxed and in a playful mood

v The first task was to determine if we were going to stay strictly to the book or attempt to catch
the emotional essence in this promotional screenplay We agreed to try to catch the emotional
favor

Why Since this is the author’s vision it’s always important to have the author 100 behind whatever

direction the screenplay will take

v Being the more experienced screenwriter I often pointed out why specific scripting elements are
used and how to use them effectively—at the same time trying to be conscious of not bloviating

Why The author had a real interest in expanding her skills and on my part

I wanted to share what I have learned and create the best screenplay our collaboration could produce

v As the FIRST DRAFT formed I pointed out what contributed to good screenplays (Present
Tense in action short action descriptions subtext in dialogue and action) and I pointed out what
made poor screenplays (clichéon-the-nosechit-chat dialogue passive action Past Tense in
action repetition of common words telling not showing) But as the FIRST DRAFT was being

TOC

formed I didn’t emphasize proper techniques The heavy lifting would come in later drafts In
this FIRST DRAFT clichéon-the-nosechit-chat dialogue was perfectly alright—passive Voice
in Past Tense is fine weak verbs and adverbs in action great The only important thing was to
get the skeleton down If the original Outline was well thought out the creative writing would
come in later drafts

Why The only thing that is important at this stage was to get the screenplay’s skeleton down

This also was a chance to get into the rhythm of how the two of us interacted

v During this FIRST DRAFT we would usually work on a scene for 5-15 minutes then pull away
if we hit a sticking point and talk about other things (ie movies and how they may have
resolved a similar issue a funny joke general observations about life etc) The main thing was
not to get bogged down by worrying about how uninspired this draft was coming out I pointed
out there would be many more drafts where’d we see the script come alive

Why In this FIRST DRAFT the emphasis must be on relaxing and not having ANY concern about the

writing quality It must be emphasized that this is only putting down the skeleton to work from

v After a few sessions we had finished the FIRST DRAFT We were ready to start on the real
work There would be many script iterations and nothing had to be brilliant for quite a while
Depending on the mood of the moment we would jump back and forth between creative
thinking (original dialogue or original scenes etc) or busy work (rewriting scenes in Present
Tense correct grammar and spelling correcting format etc)

Why It’s only natural that one or both collaborators must be in the ‘Open ModeDivergent Thinking’ in

order to tackle the demands of original thinking This Open ModeDivergent Thinking can only be

maintained for a limited time so to recover we always jumped between the two modes for maximum
results

v To achieve the maximum benefit from collaborative creative thinking each person must feel
comfortable at freely expressing their thoughts — NO MATTER HOW CRAZY THEY MAY
SOUND Each of us encouraged each other to express their ideas on story development
Ultimately there can only be one final pathway I believe that the author of the book should have
the final say on the direction the story will take

Why A story can be told brilliantly in a thousand different ways Self-Confidence in believing I can tell

a compelling story from many different directions and constraints It’s not important to me the specifics

of what direction a story takes What is important is the story ends up being compelling

v To convey information that may be useful make CROSS-CONNECTIONS with the unique
knowledge each collaborator has The knowledge that came out in the form of personal
experiences movies screenwriting techniques winemaking current events the expertise of each
collaborator etc The Cross-Connections formed from this shared information helps add to a
richer script

Why Cross-connections of information helps increase the richness and possibilities of a script

SUMMARY Collaboration can only come about if everyone involved feels relaxed and uninhibited

They must also be able to shift fluidly between the Open Mode (Divergent Thinking) and Close Mode
(Convergent Thinking) to maximize everyone’s contribution

Purpose of a First Draft

v to get the creative process flowing
v to give your initial ideas life on paper
v to provide you with something to work with later

Give yourself permission to write a real first draft

When one begins a script most writers want to write the last or only draft not a first draft They arent
willing to write the scene without editing as they go Ive often heard stories of someone agonizing over
a single page of the first draft for days and weeks

I dont think theres anything wrong with thinking about a scene before you write I believe it is
extremely valuable to Outline and plan a story and its scenes But when someone is writing a first draft
and editing every single word their internal critic is torturing themselves word by word—criticizing
ideas immediately as they come out causes writers block

When you are writing the first draft give yourself permission to write absolute crap You should reward
yourself for writing a bad first draft
Why Because that is a big part of what first drafts are about -- getting something on the page

The faster you can get something on the page the faster you can work with it And if you train yourself

to pour your ideas onto the page and edit later youll be surprised how many times youll generate some
great ideas lines and situations

TOC

Screenplay Drafts

v A first draft is about broad strokes You are starting something brand new You are working
with structure characters scenes and some basic dialogue But you dont want to obsess over
every word for two reasons First that reduces creativity at this stage of the writing
process Second tomorrow you may cut the scene and will have wasted a considerable amount
of time on tiny details Ignore your inner critic You just want the rough story on the page As
you write the first draft give your mind a world to start creating with Each new scene creates
constraints that will direct your imagination Creative processes are in motion by giving yourself
the freedom to write crap for the first draft

v The middle drafts (2 - 10 iterations) are about solving problems and elevating quality But
with every draft you should gain a deeper understanding of your story and characters By the
time you get to that final draft you have improved the quality and depth of your story Be willing
to make huge changes in the middle drafts Once the first few drafts are done you can
investigate the significant changes that will elevate your story

Ramp up your story
Take Each Scene And Do This
© get really clear on the purpose of the scene
o make sure it has the most interesting situation that will create drama for the characters If not
rewrite it make sure there is meaningful action in the scene
conclude the scene as powerfully as possible
o flag every line of dialogue that isnt the best it can be and brainstorm a dozen more ways to write
those lines
o flag every line of description that isnt the best it can be and brainstorm a dozen other ways to
write that line
© cut anything that isnt absolutely necessary

Do the same process with another scene Keep doing this until every scene in your script is absolutely
amazing As you do this process over and over the overall quality of your writing will improve
significantly and your script will bring a much more positive response from anyone who reads it

Take control of your creative process by shifting this Paradox of Quality in your favor and your
whole creative life can change for the better

The final draft is about the tiny details By this point your story characters scenes etc all work and
you are down to the fine touches -- writing more descriptive nouns and active verbs editing Dialogue to
increase emotion and power and cutting every word you can

rage He reaches inside his coat pocket but catches himself as an armed Constable (30’s) walks up and
congratulates Alan

A TV broadcasts a BBC newscast on the bombing of Big Ben Robert throws his credit card on the counter
and admires the film clip of the explosion until he sees a video of himself He sneaks a nervous glance at the
constable engrossed in the screen and high tails it out the door

Always helpful Alan hands the attendant the man’s credit card and looks out the window and reads the
pump number on where the truck sits ignoring the out of order sign The attendant processes the card turns
on the pump and returns the card to Alan

Bolting into his truck the Robert stalls the engine Petrol leaks from a busted petrol hose The truck lurches
forward and rips the hose off the pump

Petrol sprays over everything Panicking Robert drives his foot down onto the accelerator With a loud
backfire man and truck ignite into a fireball Alan and the gas attendant rush outside and stop short to
witness the catastrophe

Worried they’d be blamed the look of let’s keep this a secret pass between them A human torch staggers

A stride before reaching Alan the constable dashes out the door and empties his service revolver into the

From the smoldering mass burning at Alan’s feet an outstretched hand reaches up to Alan who carefully
places the credit card back into the dying man’s hand (Death 1 — by immolation)

Vegas

Alan’s excitement at being in Vegas is displayed in the custom’s line We meet one of the people on
PETA’s ‘hit list” Dale Dungar Alan by accident releases Dale’s exotic birds which poop on people
and Gary and escape to freedom

The frugal Alan passes the car rental place and ops for a bicycle rental

He pedals leisurely down the Vegas strip taking in the sites a line of cars honk and curse behind him
Alan signals and makes a sharp turn down the access way to Caesar’s Palace Cars speed up cursing him as
they drive by on the Vegas strip He’s oblivious to the turmoil A car breaks from the pack turns down the
access way and accelerates toward Alan Oblivious to the turmoil he’s created Alan pedals toward the
concierge’s desk

Along Caesar’s Palace access road a horde of PETA activists’ picket Seeing the danger a PETA girl Katt
Johnson (20’s) bolts into action and knocks Alan off his bike as the car slams into Alan’s bike and roars
by

Gary glares at Alan as he drives out onto the Vegas strip

Katt collects her scattered flyers and hands one to Alan It’s a ’hit list’ of most hated animal abusers by
PETA - with a picture of each leader in the industry (much like the FBI’s most-wanted list)

Alan immediately smitten introduces himself Katt’s fellow male protester Sky Moon (20’s) drags her
back to the protest line Alan carelessly drops his duffel bag which Sky trips over and knocks himself out
Caesar Palace’s Concierge (20s) fetches Alan’s bag from the wrecked bike and steps toward the hotel
entrance Overhanging lights flicker and a flock of pigeons takes flight Curses rise up from the concierge
and surrounding guests as a flock of exotic birds splatter poop on everything

The concierge watches Alan pluck a bird out of the air Gently he lowers its head to the ground The bird
coos as Alan strokes its neck Removing his hand the bird remains motionless in a hypnotic trance

The concierge snatches at a bird that flies by and fails Alan shakes his head and motions for the man to
observe Alan strokes his pigeon in the opposite direction for a moment and the bird makes an even more
pleasant cooing

Moments later the bird’s enchanting coos like the PIED PIPER the bird entices the flock to line up beside
their mate LIKE MAGIC bent over beaks to the ground they COO in harmony

Delighted the concierge fishes in his back pocket and hands Alan two front row tickets to a popular magic
show Alan nervously fiddles with the tickets and walks over and shyly asks Katt out

From the front row of a packed auditorium Alan sits mesmerized with Katt as The Amazing Richie (30’s)
a man with a mercurial sarcastic wit materializes rabbits birds and mice The mostly PETA audience
heckles the magician at using live animals

The Amazing Richie invites half a dozen PETA fanatics on stage and as he takes control through hypnosis
Alan and Katt sitting in the audience secretly come under the same spell

The Amazing Richie wrangles a sweet payback as he hands out a stack of juicy FAT burgers On command
the volunteers chow down Laughter mix with PETA shock as PETA activists in the audience rise in angry
protest

Ignoring the pandemonium Alan pulls a burger out of a sack lunch and dines as noisy chaos reigns around
him

The Amazing Richie’s commands turn the volunteers into eaters of dead animal flesh Boos and screams of
laughter and anger from the audience obscure the fact that Alan and Katt are under the same control

swath of PETA protesters in the audience Non-PETA members in the audience how with laughter

On a roll raising his voice above the clamor ‘The Amazing Richie’ with a PETA flyer in hand transforms
a stage dummy in the minds of his volunteers into the faces on the PETA ‘hit list’ A moment later the stage
volunteers rip it apart The volunteers snap out of their trance as The Amazing Richie gives the secret
release command to bring them back to normal A command Alan and Katt never hear above the din
PETA activists retch as they stumble out into the parking lot

Alan and Katt soak up the names images and profiles on the PETA list

Outside the auditorium Katt’s PETA friends spirit her away

Alan checks into his room at Caesar’s He stiffs the Bellman (20’s) by handing him fake casino money he
finds in the room as a tip

He switches on the big screen TV and sees news of the PETA activists protesting in front of the MGM
where the annual Meat Packing Convention is held Alan notices the spokesperson for the convention is
Vincent De Russo (cattle baron) first on PETA’s ‘hit list’

Alan heads down to the lobby As he passes through a gambling alcove he sees a woman (Slot Machine
Lady (30’s) with a bucket of coins at a slot machine He goes into an All You Can Eat Buffet where he
creates chaos when he releases the live lobsters crabs snails and birds

From a cage of birds Alan is convinced by a colorful talking parrot Mr Finch to release him and his cage
mates Released they escape after terrorizing a number of the dining guests

Mr Finch pledges to look after Alan’s back

Leaving the buffet Alan wanders into the casino drinking a soda and carrying a roll of what appears to be
candy The slot machine lady tries to hoard her favorite slot machine but has to leave for the bathroom when
the always generous Alan mistakes the roll of laxatives for candy he’d pilfered from a dining table earlier
and gives the woman several

She attempts to reach the restroom but fails badly as the pucker on her ass gives out Her bucket of quarters
crashes to the floor One quarter rolls up to Alan who puts it in the slot machine the lady had been hoarding
and wins 10000

As he collects his winnings a Convention Hustler (20s) convinces him to go inside to the Security and
Protection Convention happening in the Hotel

Inside Alan’s fascinated by the motion detectors and plays with them until the hustler steers him to his own
exhibit of stunners

Alan accidentally tries out a 12 million volt cattle prod on the Convention Hustler Feeling guilty Alan puts
more fake money on the man’s chest and walks out

Outside Alan points to a bike the concierge still playing with the pigeons nods ok

Pedaling up to the MGM convention center Alan encounters a group of PETA activists wearing animal
masks who are putting on an elaborate play showing the mistreatment of animals (THE THEME OF THE
PETA ACTIVISTS AT THEIR CONVENTION) A PETA activist puts a DEATH MASK on Alan

An MGM security team rushes outside to beat down the protesters blocking entry to the convention

Alan strolls past the scuffle and into the convention cattle prod in hand

Clutching the PETA hit list Alan compares images on the flyer with the thousands wandering around Giant
screens advertise meat products and sponsors On it the flamboyant Vincent De Russo is being
interviewed about his ‘Death Art Exhibition’ being shown that evening at his Vegas Art Studio Alan takes
off toward where De Russo is giving the interview

TOC

Outside the convention Gary Long waits in line to buy a ticket All tickets are sold out He pays dearly for a
ticket from an Asshole Scalper (20’s)

Upon reaching De Russo Alan wearing the mask of death sees De Russo’s electric cart with several
paintings depicting animal killings in various industries Alan hands the PETA flyer to De Russo who
thinks he wants an autograph De Russo reaches for the flyer only to be jolted by the 12-million-volt baton
De Russo loses all bowel control and collapses

Shock passes through the crowd Wearing the Death Mask Alan picks up De Russo’s flyers promoting the
‘Death Art Exhibit’ and hands them out People take the whole thing as a promotional stunt Everyone
applauds

Alan drives the cart toward the nearest exit packed with paintings and De Russo a trail of piss out his pant
leg marking their progress

As Gary enters the convention from one location Alan exits at another

In MGM’s parking lot drivers go ballistic behind Alan’s slow-moving cart The honking and cursing can be
heard all the way into the Convention Center where Gary watches a live feed of what is occurring outside
as Alan disappears and turns onto the Vegas Strip

Gary sits in his cheap hotel room watching the news about his brother’s death He plays the violin to relax
and concentrate From the adjoining room there’s a pounding on the wall and an angry voice to shut up
Gary pounds back on the wall and goes back to playing the violin

A few minutes later there’s a pounding on the door Two men stand at the door when Gary opens it One is
the asshole scalper he encountered earlier Gary grins puts on a pair of brass knuckles and wades into them
Bones crack and teeth fly The asshole scalper is hit so hard Gary’s fist disappears into the man’s skull
Gary goes to the room next door and finds several thousand dollars in a briefcase

Gary steals away into the night with his suitcase violin and a briefcase full of cash

Gary pays cash as he checks into Caesars Palace Walking down the hallway with the bellman Gary notices
the cameras in Caesar’s security system

At the Art Gallery De Russo wakes for a moment before Alan uses the cattle prod again on him Alan sees
a video camera and points it at De Russo as he pulls out a fishing knife (Death 2 — stripes of meat sliced
off)

That evening at the Convention Center dozens of big tables are set out for a formal dinner Vegas’ Sheriff
Harry Johnson his wife young son and his daughter Katt sit at a table with the Vegas’ Mayor Eric
Connor and his young daughter and wife

Titans of the meat industry populate the adjoining VIP table Frank Lean (safari hunter’s club) Chi-
Chi Mason (puppy mill) Connie Sanders (chicken heiress) Sal Manfish (salmon
harvester) Larry Seaman (lobster harvester) and Dale Dungar (exotic birds) Jefferson Tiger
(30’s) (exotic cats) Natalie Right (insects and bugs) and Steve Sharp (big sea life)

Katt studies those at the VIP table matching each to those on her PETA ‘hit list’ flyer She observers Dale
Dungar rotating a pair of Baoding Balls (silver solid metal spheres) around in his hand They are all there
but De Russo supposedly giving an exhibit Katt gets introductions from her father as she gathers their
business cards

She hands each a special fancy (hand-embossed) PEN (iPhone enabled tracking chip) She returns to her
table pulls out her iPhone and clicks on a location app and there on her screen are nine beeping lights

A live feed from the De Russo’s Art Gallery entertains the convention guests on the Convention Center’s
big screen

TOC

Mr Finch (the parrot) has gotten into the Convention Center and dive bombs the VIP table cursing at Dale
Dungar and the rest of the guests Chi-Chi Mason pulls a can of hair spray out of her purse and sprays the
flying annoyance Two small dogs she has by her side she also sprays when they bark at her

A big screen at De Russo’s Art Studio proclaims the event ‘Death Art personal exhibits of Vincent De
Russo ’ Each gruesome exhibit carries a sign beneath it written in blood

Dale Dungar gets up from the table and walks over to step on Mr Finch still regaining his sight The two
dogs attack Dungar’s leg and he trips and the two Baoding Balls slips out of his hands and rolls over to Mr
Finch who swoops them up and flies away just out of Dungar’s outstretched hands

In his DEATH MASK Alan moves from exhibit to exhibit at the Art Studio lecturing A hand a heart a
liver two femur bones pinned to the wall with bloody titles written below and in the center of the room on
a table is a life-like replica of Vincent De Russo’s head

At the Art Studio’s serving table hostesses liberally pour wine and serve up fried strips of meat which
sizzles in a wok

Back at the Convention Center servers bring out real strips of fried beef A festive atmosphere at both
locations has everyone digging into the gourmet food

Outside De Russo’s Art Studio PETA activists march Many are wearing animal masks A group of people
gathers around the centerpiece of art De Russo ’s Head A woman reaches out and touches it It feels real
Then someone swats at a fly that had landed on the head As people lean in for a closer look the gallery’s
big display screen goes live We see cattle being disembodied at a slaughterhouse

We cut to De Russo hanging and screaming Scenes flip back and forth from the dismemberment of the
cattle and the dismemberment of De Russo A time-lapse montage sees him dismembered and
disemboweled the muscles from his body are tossed in the bowl for frying Everyone’s eyes turn to the
bowl with the remaining strips They all realize the truth The art audience retch as Alan walks out to vanish
among the activists out front

Back at the Convention Center’s formal dinner everyone stares down at their beef strips and becomes
violently ill

Katt unaffected walks over to the VIP table and helps Chi-Chi up after the lady slips in her own vomit Two
small puppies bark at Chi-Chi she swats at them sending one flying across the room yelping

Out front of the art gallery a figure that resembles Alan slips away down a dark alley A figure mirrors the
man’s every move The stalked man carries a McDonald’s paper bag and a hand full of PETA ‘hit list’
flyers He stops and reaches inside the bag

The sheriff stands over a body (Death 3 — throat slit) a ‘Big Mac’ lays nearby along with a death mask
The sheriff picks up the death mask and tells the Mayor that this dead man must have been the killer and
was murdered by an angry public Blood obscures the man’s face

At a joint news conference by the sheriff and mayor a reporter nicknames the killer “The Grim Reaper’ The
mayor announces ‘The Grim Reaper’ is dead A news video of the attack on De Russo by the man in the
death mask is shown

At Caesars Palace’s front desk Katt asks for Alan’s room and finds he’s not in

Close by in the lobby Gary recognizes Katt as being the woman that saved Alan earlier He also spots the
flyer she grips

Gary follows her outside as she joins the PETA activists He walks up to her and takes a flyer she is handing
out He sees a patrol car approach and wanders off It is Katt’s father sheriff Johnson stopping to pick her

up

TOC

After the sheriff and Katt drive off Gary inquires and discovers Katt is the sheriff’s daughter He takes a
glance at the flyer in his hand and tosses it away

Late evening outside ‘The Puppy Mill’ Chi-Chi carries a small cage housing two puppies squeezed
uncomfortably inside With a key she opens the door and carelessly tosses the dog cage inside—the two
dogs yelp Chi-Chi pours herself a drink and removes her shoes A buzzer sounds Chi-Chi goes to the glass
door A figure is silhouetted in the light behind the door Chi-Chi smiles and answers It is the mayor of Las
Vegas They passionately embrace

It’s late-night and the mayor leaves—Chi-Chi’s upset at his leaving The buzzer sounds and we see a
silhouetted figure in the light of the door again She opens the door and a figure steps inside wearing a death
mask Chi-Chi steps back and trips over the dog cage and knocks herself out

Chi-Chi wakes screaming her entrails hang out the two pups are playing tug of war with her guts (Death 4
— puppies eat Chi-Chi’s intestines before she becomes a kite) Alan digs one of her eyes out and drops it on
the ground and the two puppies play with it Alan finds some balls of colorful string as he constructs
something

The music in the background is the old country standard “Don’t it make my brown eyes blue” Alan softy
hums along as he carefully strips her face off her skull He records the evisceration for a YouTube video
Cutting to an extreme close up an eye patch vibrates VERY SLOWLY pulling back we see the rest of the
woman’s face including her one remaining eye nose ears hair etc It jitters back and forth We pull back
further and we see Chi-Chi’s distorted face sewn to a kite From the ground the kite recedes into a little
speck

In a park Alan strolls along wearing a doggy medical cone collar (keeps dogs from itching their heads) on
his neck obscuring his face A kite he flies soars high overhead with colorful streamers

Two kids spot the kite and rush over to Alan who hands over the kite and walks away past the sheriff and
mayor who talk about who ‘The Grim Reaper’ was

The kids come over and they are the sheriff and mayor’s children The sheriff thinks something looks odd
and starts reeling in the kite They are horrified when they realize a person’s face and skin make up the kite
and intestines the kite’s tail

The next day YouTube fans discover a video about ‘The Puppy Mill’ It shows Chi-Chi’s security cameras
filming the encounter with ‘The Grim Reaper’ Bad news for the mayor for it shows the mayor’s tryst with
Chi-Chi

At Caesar’s the front desk clerk hails Alan and hands him a note as he enters It contains a detailed itinerary
of Sal Manfish’s evening movements

The press goes crazy pressing the mayor about the video showing the mayor entering Chi-Chi’s complex
late in the evening and leaving much later They also press the sheriff about ‘The Grim Reaper’ still being
alive

Sal Manfish drives up alone to Caesars Palace’s valet station in a SUV He tosses the keys to the Valet who tears a valet ticket and gives him half Sal brushes passed Alan on the way inside

Eyes watch Sal gamble throughout the evening Sal gets up and looks around as he exits the casino and
hands the parking ticket to the valet Sal’s key is missing from the key case The valet shakes his head as he
heads down the ramp to the garage

The valet drives up and hands Sal the keys Sal opens the trunk and tosses in his briefcase no one’s there
He jumps in the driver’s seat and drives off

The valet walks over to the key case when another man hands him a parking slip and again the key is

missing and when the valet arrives at the second man’s car space the car is missing

Sal drives into a secured compound outside of town Security gates close behind him At the door is Larry
Seaman who welcomes him Lining the walls inside are animal trophies Sal opens his briefcase pulls out a
PETA ‘hit list’ flyer and hands it to Larry “I think we’re being hunted” He holsters a gun he retrieves from
his briefcase Larry thinks hes ridiculous

A silent alarm goes off Larry checks the screen It’s the outer wall of the compound A monitor shows an
infrared image of a person dropping over the wall

Larry grabs his rifle and shuts the lights off Then he cracks the door and points the rifle The intruder sees
the lights go out and tries to step back into the shadows as the rifle fires He’s hit and goes down—Larry
storms out the door to finish off his quarry

Larry notices Sal’s SUV backdoor is cracked open

Sal watches Larry pursue the wounded intruder over the wall

The front door creaks open and Alan wearing a mask enters He is carrying his stun stick Sal is
momentarily surprised by the intruder but then a grin comes over his face Cameras in the house record the
interaction between Sal and the intruder

The sound of gunfire comes from outside the compound

Sal pulls a gun from his pocket and smiles at the intruder The intruder keeps coming Sal points his gun and
fires Nothing He pulls the trigger several more times Nothing The intruder pulls a handful of bullets from
his pocket and reaches out with the stunner and ZAP Sal drops (Death 5 — face and skin becomes a pillow
for the puppies)

At the same moment in the darkness of the woods Gary comes up behind Larry and slits his throat from ear
to ear (Death 6 — slit throat — blood draining out) Blood gushes everywhere The wounded Gary grabs his
arm and wanders off to his car

Alan rips electric cords out from lamps and hogties the body and walks out to Sal’s SUV

Alan plays with the remote-control motors of the security camera He’s intrigued

In Caesars Palace lobby a huge stuffed elephant greets people Alan walks into the security office wearing
an animal mask He zaps the guard with his stunner turns off the monitors and puts on the guards uniform
Walking through the lobby a flatbed truck rolls up at the entrance and a bunch of Mexican day laborers
pile off and head inside Alan’s team hauls the elephant carcass out onto the flatbed and drives off

They unload the elephant at Sal’s compound and haul it inside Alan gives the laborers a thousand dollars
Later that day the hauling truck arrives again a tarp covers the stuffed elephant carcass

The laborers drive up to Frank Lean’s ‘Safari Hunter’s Club’ and one hands Frank an official paper from
Caesar’s Palace The laborer doesn’t speak English but Frank’s impressed and has the covered statue
brought into the club On the walls are dozens of stuffed animals The new contribution to the collection is
brought front and center still covered

That evening members of the Safari Club sit at tables in front of the massive covered mystery At precisely
800 pm Frank taps on crystal glass and talks about the clubs new acquisition the rare WHITE elephant
He whips off the covering tarp The members many old and pompous gather around the statue some
smoking cigars One reaches out and touches the statue and white comes off in his finger The man
comments and shows his finger to Frank Frank and everyone gather for a closer inspection and several
reach out to touch the statue themselves Kerosene sprays out the trunk of the elephant and a cigar catches it
on fire The room’s death screams form the backdrop to a less than elegant dance or scramble of death
(Death 7 — group incineration)

Outside the Safari Club Sal’s SUV driven by Alan drives away Through the car window we see the two
rescue puppies of the late Chi-Chi

The sheriff views the new gruesome surveillance videos from the Safari Club’s that appears on YouTube
Fear and fascination grip the news broadcasts which proclaim ‘The Grim Reaper’ strikes again

Alan’s busy in the kitchen of Sal’s compound chopping parts of Sal into bits and shoveling them into a large
skillet He cracks in a few eggs and creates scrambled Sal soufflé

Humming away the aroma wakes the two rescue puppies from Chi-Chi’s who eagerly rush in and jump on
Alan’s trousers for the tasty treat Alan tosses the puppys SAL TREATS

At sheriff Johnson’s house Katt’s father has come across the PETA ‘hit list’ flyer and notices that Vincent
De Russo (cattle baron) Chi-Chi Mason (puppy mills) Frank Lean (safari club) were all on this list Katt
overhears her father on the phone to the office asking for the directions to Sal Manfish and Larry Seaman
She overhears that Larry Seaman has been on a missing person’s list for the last few days Sheriff Johnson
writes down the addresses of Sal and Larry Katt heads out the door

Katt drives down a road in the wilderness As she approaches Sal’s compound she notices buzzards circling
outside in the woods

The gates are closed She drives around the backside of the compound and parks She scales the wall
Sheriff Johnson finds no one home at Larry’s place

As the police caravan approach Sal’s compound sheriff Johnson diverts the column toward the buzzards
swarming outside the compound

At the crime scene we see buzzards stripping the meat off the bones of an unknown body

Police cautiously enter the compound and discover the remains of Sal

Katt drives away from outside the compound and is stopped by a police roadblock An officer asks to see
her license And notices the name She says she’s the police chief’s daughter and was out there looking for
him He calls up and gets the chief who surprised to hear his daughter is there He guesses she’s protesting
these people He tells the officer to let her pass He’s about to do this when he hears a bark from inside the
trunk He opens it to find two puppies He motions her on

Katt drives down a dirt road and from the bushes Alan jumps out and hops into the trunk

They return to Caesar’s Palace and have a romantic dinner in one of the hotel restaurants

Gary in the lobby still mending from his gunshot wound sees the two love birds enter While they eat he
sees the latest news about the death of Sal and Larry Something clicks and he walks out and grabs a PETA
‘hit list’ flyer from an activist inside the lobby struggling to not be evicted He sees that everyone but two
people Doug Dungar and Connie Sanders on the list has been killed

In the lobby waiting for Alan Gary relaxes and plays a romantic melody on his violin A crowd gathers
around him Alan and Katt exit the restaurant and join the crowd Gary looks up and nervously sees Alan
before him He believes Alan or Katt will recognize him but they are oblivious Alan puts a hundred dollar
bill in his violin case and the affectionate couple head upstairs to his hotel room

Gary goes into the restaurant but the Waiter (20’s) tells him it is closed for the evening Gary hands the
waiter the hundred dollar bill and walks back into the kitchen A Cook explains he can make him a fresh
chicken sandwich as he points to a cage of live chickens A label proclaims Connie Sanders chickens
always fresh just ask the chicken There is also an address right outside Vegas The cook notices Gary
reading the label “For another 100 I’Il tell you her real address”

Gary scribbles a message and leaves it in Alan’s room mailbox at the front desk and heads out the door
Alan and Katt walk through the lobby and stops to pick up his messages at the front desk The message

reads “this is the address of Connie Sanders”

Alan and Katt walk out of the lobby and bump into Dale Dungar carrying a big cage of exotic birds that
were on display inside the lobby

The cage busts open and one of the birds that escape is a female parrot An angry Dale staggers toward
Alan out to strangle him Suddenly a small metal ball dropped from above smashes into Dale’s arm and
shatters it He looks up into the sky and sees Mr Finch From a great height a large bird poop drops on his

Death from being giving the bird)

Gary drives up to Connie Sanderss chicken ranch gets out of the car and walks over to a massively large
building He slides open the door and the spectacle of 50000 chickens greet him Violently allergic he
convulses in a fit of sneezing He slams the door shut and heads into the house wearing a death mask similar
to worn earlier by ‘The Grim Reaper’ He walks up to Connie who’s drinking and watching the news
broadcast Half sauced she glances up at the frightening sight of who she believes is “The Grim Reaper’ As
Gary removes his mask Connie lunges for a gun on the table — a little slow Gary knocks her out pulls out
his violin and starts playing

Headlights shining across the window announces the arrival of Alan and Katt

Alan and Katt enter and are greeted by Gary in a mask who yanks the stunner out of Alan’s hands and
shocks the couple

Alan and Katt wake among an ocean of chickens The electric shock has brought them out of their trance
with no knowledge of ‘The Grim Reaper’ killings Alan does remember a statement by Gary of his vow to
kill him because of his brother’s death Alan conveys this to Katt with the belief they are about to be killed
Assuring Katt that everything will be fine Alan swings into action He grabs a chicken bends its beak to the
ground and strokes it’s neck until a pleasant melody comes out of it He then reverses the stroke and an
even nicer rhythm sounds across the acres of chickens

Gary drags a now conscious Connie by the hair screaming outside to the chicken coop

The chicken pen door slides open to the sight of Gary He’s holding a canister of gasoline which he plans to
burn down the pen with Alan and Katt inside He tells why he’s killing Alan and Katt and he’s going to
frame them for killing Connie Gary raises the gun to Connie’s head and knocks her out He throws Connie
inside and tosses the death mask over to Alan

Gary flips open a lighter flicks it on

Alan drags Katt to the ground and lets out a BIRD SQUAWK and a quarter of a million pounds of poultry
take flight straight toward Gary who’s blasted off his feet The canister of gasoline spills on Gary A second
later he tries to fend off the chickens with the stunner setting off a fireball that engulfs him As his screams
die the hungry chickens peck and strip every ounce of meat off his charred bones (Death 9 — death by
conflagration and weight loss due to becoming a meal for chickens)

Moments later the police arrive having tracked Katt’s cell phone

Connie steps forward ratting about how Alan Katt and her chickens saved her life and from now on she
plans to raise the chickens to wander free for the rest of their lives and she will become a champion of
animal rights

News accounts announce the heroes Alan and Katt Alan and Katt give a national interview on their
experience and their take on animal rights

Why Script Critique and Analysis Is Useful

99 of all screenplays which are submitted to Production CompaniesProducersActorsAgentsetc are
so poorly written that within a dozen pages the reader will be compelled to send them directly to the
trash

Why Poor formatting typos clunky dialogue bland characters confusing story logic slow story
development and just plain boring — that is the norm And if your script falls into the 99 you will
have alienated your potential client from ever looking at any of your works again

There is no need for an experienced reader to slog through a hundred pages of amateur writing to reject
a script

Sending in your script without it first being critiqued and analyzed by a professional is probably a waste
of you and your potential client’s time

The question then is how you know who to send your script to Above I have a link to an actual critique
and analysis of a script which I analyzed and what you can expect from my services Also is the
rewritten script taking into account my recommendations and corrections

Still not sure I personally offer to critique and analyze the first dozen pages of your script for FREE
You can decide if my comments were useful and if your script wouldn’t benefit from a complete

examination

At a minimum you will have confirmation of the quality of your opening dozen pages or a cautionary
warning that you may need to reexamine your script before sending it out to the world

Chapter 8 Screenwriting Exercises

The vast majority of screenwriters make the same common mistakes and bore the readers with their lack
of imagination which makes their scripts unusable In the pages above I showed what’s expected in a
screenplay and thousands of specific examples of professional screenplays Below is a series of
techniques to enhance your creativity which if effectively practiced will help put your script in that
01 (1 in 1000) which is needed to be considered as a professional script This assumes you come up
with original compelling story ideas

Common Words (Exercise 1)

One of the problems encountered is the constant repetition of words in both action and dialogue which
has a tendency of drawing the readeraudience out of the story because of the word’s familiarity In
order to eliminate the repetition you need an easy method to take these words and replace them with
more original words that pinpoint the exact emotionfeeling you wish to convey

What to Do

v Create a WordExcel file with the object of creating an index of commonly repeated words you’d
find in a screenplay (angry grab hit laugh look move talk walk etc)

v By going through hundredsthousands of screenplays and writing down the variations of these
words you will create a repository of words you can use in your screenplays

v Take each of the words you’ve written down and create a sentence with the word

v Finally after you finish your first draft step through your screenplay and replace the commonly
repeated words with the BEST word you now have access to

Why

v It familiarizes you with the use of evocative words you can use in your screenplays

v It allows the mind to expand its vocabulary of useful words

v The use of a variety of interesting words helps stimulate the reader’s interest and helps them
believe you have a command of the English language

v The more you use these words the easier it is for you to evoke emotion in both the reader and
any person you may present your screenplay too

v Like everything used in excess using the same words over and over slowly disengages the reader
a little each time Something new and unfamiliar but evocative engages the readers thinking for
an instance keeping them in the story

v Trying to figure out what sub-category to put a word or what sentence to give as an example
forces a level of creative thinking

v It supercharges your creative use of words

Below is a link of ‘Common Words’ and variations that will come in handy when trying to evoke
emotion in your screenplay and avoid word repetition (this list is continuously being updated and
expanded — to have the greatest benefit on your learning creativity and understanding You should
create your own list from the screenplays found in this book)

Character Descriptions (Exercise 2)

A critical ability for the reader is to visualize a character The first step is to have a visual image of who
a character is when first introduced in your script Don’t list a boring compellation of the character’s
physical description or stylish clothes they wear— the actor cast will not match these characteristics

What grabs the imagination and reaches into the core of who someone is their personality
characteristics the components of their emotional makeup and unique talents

What to Do

Create a WordExcel file with descriptions of characters you see in screenplays Take them from the
hundredsthousands of screenplays you look through It’s hard to come up with great character
descriptions on the fly By creating an extensive collection of character descriptions you will be able to
evoke an original character and with these written down characteristics you should be able to blend
them into new original descriptions

Why

An evocative description of a character stamps a visual that will translate to the reader as they read your
script

Below is a link of ‘Character Descriptions’ which will come in handy when trying to evoke emotion in
your screenplay and avoid monotonous repetition

Interesting Phrases (Exercise 3)
The ability to keep the reader’s attention is needed to produce a screenplay that will stand out Bland
boring phrases will sap the life out of even the best stories

What to Do

Create a WordExcel file with the interesting phrases which you come across as you read many of the
screenplays which you can access from this book and use as is or modify to include in your own
screenplay

Below is a link of ‘Interesting Phrases’ which will come in handy when trying to evoke emotion in your
screenplay and avoid boring phrases we’ve heard a hundred times

(this list is continuously being updated and expanded — to have the greatest benefit on your learning
and understanding You should create your list from the screenplays found in this book)

Dialogue Types (Exercise 4)

Knowledge is power It’s essential to recognize the different types of dialogue that are used in a
screenplay These can be classified into these six categories or some combination

v Chit-ChatSmall Talk

ExpositionInformational

Clichés

On-The-NoseDirect

ObliqueIndirect

Subtext

LLL KK

In order to deeply understand how these dialogues are used you need to study how they are used in
screenplays

What to Do

Take MANY screenplays and in every dialogue block comment on what type of dialogue does it fall
into (Chit-Chat On-The-Nose IndirectOblique Exposition Subtext Clichés or a combination of
types)

See if much of the dialogue can be replaced and condensed with more visual action Try to replace Chit-
ChatSmall Talk Cliché and On-The-Nose with IndirectOblique or Subtext if you can’t replace
altogether with action

Why

This will teach you to recognize different types of dialogue and understand most dialogue is filler and
can be replaced by action

Types of Dialogue

Chit-ChatSmall TalkEveryday Talk
Everyday boring question and answer This disengages the reader and he tunes out because it is
predictable boring and doesn’t advance the story It leads to boredom and the death of your script
Example
John Hi Jane
Jane Hi John how are you today
John Fine

ExpositionInfor mational Dialogue

It is dialogue that supplies information that normally no person would say It is used to advance the
story It is dialogue that supplies facts that a person wouldn’t normally convey but the writer feels
necessary to supply for their story to make sense Usually dialogue that a character would know without
saying Because people in real life have a history they know information that doesn’t need to be
restated

TOC

In a story it sounds artificial and quickly takes one out of the story leading to boredom
Example
Bob Joan you’re my sister you’re twenty-five with two kids I just want you to tell
John here my dear brother who’s also married with two kids that I think he’s
crazy for getting a degree in history

Clichés

These are overused phrases which when uttered drops for a moment the reader out of the story because
the more familiar an utterance or action the less the brain needs to engage Too many of these sayings
and you disengage entirely Every time you find a cliché you have a great opportunity to show your
originality which will both engage the reader more and show how in command of the English language
you are Use sparingly if at all

On-The-NoseDirect Dialogue
Is dialogue that is directly on the topic at hand It is usually predictable because each person is on the
same topic and they get into a groove of speaking so the other person It often can be predicted what
will be said which is usually some cliché saying so they don’t have to think Characters should never
state what’s on their minds without nuance or Subtext They should never sound like exposition or long-
winded explanations Predictability leads to boredom
Example

John Judy I’d love to have sex with you Your breasts are huge looking in that dress and

we should just go at it right here

Judy Fat chance

John exhibits a clear direct goal He wants to bed Judy In real life he’d come across as a dirtbag if he
said this

ObliqueIndirect Dialogue
It is dialogue where each person has their own agenda and is not usually interested in what the other
person is saying or they wish to divert the conversation in a different direction This is usually
unpredictable keeping the reader guessing is not informational compresses the story and is interesting
and engaging
Example

John has a secret birthday party planned for Judy at a restaurant But she wants to stay

home

John Let’s take a drive up the coast This summer heat is killing me

Judy You go I love the summer just relaxing and reading this book

John I’ve heard pest control coming by today to fumigate Grab your book and you can

read in the car

Subtext Dialogue
Is dialogue about the messagethoughtsemotions below the actual words or visual the audience feels
andor hears This engages the reader for this is the world we really live in The reason Subtext is

TOC

preferred is because the readeraudience has to engage in what’s happening because of the possible
multiple meanings (Over 90 of scripts have virtually no Subtext — that eliminates them immediately)
Example
On a date at a restaurant Judy’s a little drunk and gets up and slow dances to very erotic
music
At the end of the dance she comes back to the table where John has been watching
mesmerized
Judy All that dancing stimulates one’s appetite
John focuses on Judy and pauses to fill her wine glass
John It certainly does
Judy nods ok for John to fill her wine glass

John has conveyed to Judy and the audience that he’s interested in her She can’t be offended because on
the surface the direct dialogue conveys that he simply agrees with her but she and we know what he
really means And she nods giving the go-ahead that she is interested

Active and Present Tense (Exercise 5)

Screenplays are written in the Present Tense and ideally in Active Voice This adds immediacy and
visual action to the action Many screenplays I see have blocks of action in Passive Voice and Past Tense
What to Do

In your existing script rewrite all actiondescription in Present Tense and Active Voice

Why

It will make the reading more dynamic shorten the number of words and add greater clarity

Active Voice

Use of action verbs that show movement or action or taking place in the moment as opposed to having
taken place already An actor must be able to perform the action Action is the manifestation of feelings
and thoughts through activity In screenwriting the acid test for action will be whether it is behavior that
actors can perform and a camera can photograph Action should be written in the Present Tense
preferably Simple Present Tense

Passive Voice
conjugation of ‘to be’ verb

Infinitive Be

Present

Participle Being

Past participle Been

Person Number Present Past
Ist singular I Am was
2nd singular You Are were
3rd singular hesheit Is was

TOC

Ist plural We Are were
2nd plural You Are were
3rd plural They Are were

Feelings and Emotions (Exercise 6)

In writing a rich layered character evokes an understanding of how we might feel and react if we were
in their position This is what is lacking in CartoonFlatStereo Type Characters which is what most
writers cough up in their scripts This completely disengages the readeraudience because they can’t
relate emotionally to them — these characters do not react like REAL humans The reader is not brought
into their world and has no more emotional feeling to what happens to them as they would worry about a
brick

If anything the readeraudience feels annoyed and cheated in Stereotype characters All characters in a
screenplay should at the minimum evoke Empathy without this feeling the reader cannot engage in what
is taking place

Pity — I acknowledge your suffering but is usually from a condescending viewpoint Those pitied
are not looked on as equals

Sympathy —I care about your suffering more from an academic perspective — a greater sense of shared
similarities and a more profound engagement

Empathy —I feel your suffering — it’s the ability to recognize and share the feelingsemotions of
another

Compassion —I want to relieve you suffering — I am suffering with you — is the feelings of the desire to
help and are worried for their well-being

What to Do

A very useful exercise is to go through your script and in each scene describe the emotions YOU are
feeling for each of the characters What emotions do you feel as you read the script Pity Sympathy
Empathy Compassion Fear Anger Sadness Joy Disgust Surprise Trust Anticipation Shame
Courage Kindness Indignation Envy Love Annoyance Rage Hate etc

If your script is written well you will at least feel empathy (they will seem human) and hopefully you
feel compassion and emotions flood over you

Why

It’s critical you have feelings for your characters as soon as possible else what happens to them has no
emotional impact which means you have no interest in the story

(eg In ‘Eye in the Sky’ a young African girl is introduced playing with a Hula Hoop Inside her
father’s compound she entertains herself spinning the Hula-Hoop around her waist Nearby her father
is repairing a bicycle for an Islamic custom which speaks harshly about the girl’s activities He insists
the father reprimands her Her father tells the girl to stop which calms the man’s anger After the man

TOC

leaves the father tells his daughter she can still play with the Hula-Hoop but not in front of Islamic
customers The emotions we feel are our compassion for the girl knowing that in life she will be treated
poorly in the culture we’re encountering We also feel empathy for the father knowing his dilemma at
restricting his daughter’s freedom From then on we worry about what might happen to this young girl
as she sits outside on the street next to a terrorist’s compound selling bread — a compound the Americans
and British are about to destroy with a drone missile)

Replace Dialogue With Action (Exercise 7)
A movie is a visual audio depiction of a story The concept of a single picture is worth a thousand
words should apply in which case load as many visual images into your story as much as possible

What to Do

Remove dialogue and replace it with action Go through your script and using your imagination see how
much dialogue can be replaced by action

Why

“One Picture Is Worth A Thousand Words’ The images evoked by action engages the readeraudience
more than dialogue Dialogue should be a supplement to visual action and not used as a crutch for lack
of imagination

Add Rhythm To Dialogue and Action (Exercise 8)

For a readeraudience to more successfully engage in your screenplay it must flow with the appropriate
a rhythm for what is occurring in your story at the moment

What to Do

Read your screenplay out loud Change words as needed to create a rhythm in the dialogue and action
that connects with the readeraudience

Why

Just like words sung in a song resonate with the listener so does the rhythms of well-structured dialogue
and action Rhythms in dialogue help engage the readeraudience in what is taking place Poor awkward
dialogue disengages the readeraudience because it is more difficult to process This also applies to your
action descriptions for a readeractorproducerinvestor

because of the Opening Credits we expect there is something menacing - we begin gathering clues
‘Guy Fawkes Day’ is about a time in England that represented revolution and bombing -

our first named character ROBERT LONG is described as GRIM AND BRUTISH — he sounds
dangerous - since he’s given a PROPER NAME he must be important — we want to follow him

he hides his face behind a ‘Guy Fawkes’ MASK which represents revolution

important

How To Pitch Your Screenplay

Given a chance to pitch your story here are some things you should prepare for

introduce yourself — share interesting information about yourself
how did you come up with the story

know something about the interviewer that connects with you (if possible)
story title and why its relevant

what genre(s) does your story fit into

does your story have a High-Concept

how do you see your story presented - as a feature or series

why is your story important

whats your story’s logline

whats your storys theme

what taglines go with your story

prepare a short 2 to 5 minute synopsis

who do you envision as the character leads

what have you done so far to advance your story

TOC

e what other stories have you created

Luck Favors the Prepared

when given the opportunity dont waste it - if youre asked if you have other ideas and you say you
dont then like Keyser S6ze your connection will vanish - never to return - an opportunity wasted

For this pitching exercise I will use one of my scripts The Shadows’ with its link
https thescriptsavantcompdftheshadowspdf

What follows is a possible scenario of interactions between You and an Interviewer
Ill cover what you should be prepared for when pitching your story

Inter viewer Introduce yourself
subtext what have you done why are you interesting

You My name is Dallas Jones and Im originally a software developer and an athlete I ran track in
the Marine Corps I recently wrote the remake of Stephen Kings CUJO for the original distributor of
Cujo Sunn Classic Pictures And I have a website that is dedicated to screenwriting —
httpsthescriptsavantcom

Why give the interviewer a hook into who you are which hopefully will make a personal connection
and lead to a positive exchange of dialogue

For this exercise lets have fun and take a well-established producer as the Interviewer JJ
Abrams

I choose him because he has a house in Santa Monica down the hill from where I live I typed in JJ
Abrams in google and found he was the Executive Producer on one of my favorite series Person of
Interest and was soon coming out with a Sci-Fi series called Contraband Both are innovative Sci-Fi
series Sci-Fi being something I believe hes interested in

You I see you enjoy Sci-Fi One of my favorite shows was the Person of Interest series starring Jim
Caviezel The show sounds like it explored the first steps of the Singularity (the merging of humans with
superhuman intelligence changing the nature of man — I believe it will be the next step in evolution on
this planet)

Why find out what the interviewer might be interested in - connect with the interviewer on a personal
level — theyll show a greater interest in you and your story — if you know who will be interviewing you

look them up on the internet

Inter viewer How did you come up with the story

TOC
You Late at night I often listen to Coast to Coast’ The ultimate in conspiracies Alien Invasions The
Hollow Earth UFOs Vampires and Monsters and behind each an expert who professes the dark
secrets of each I wanted to create a radio show The Abyss that searchers out conspiracies and
attracts believers They uncover a real truth the destruction of life on this planet by a new life form that

moves through time The problem is the leaders of the world don’t believe them

Why show that you have a depth of knowledge or at least have thought a lot about what’s related to
your story

Inter viewer Does your story have a title

You The Shadows - involves multi-dimensional creatures moving through the shadows of time

Why connect the title to the story — so the interviewer makes a connection — always give enough
information to help the interviewer connect

Inter viewer how do you envision your story being presented

You Ive written what could be the pilot for a multiple film series or with minor modification a
standalone feature

Why some investorsproducers are looking for a film series while other’s are looking only for feature
films The more flexible you’ve structured your story the greater chance you will match up with possible
investors

Interviewer what genre(s) do your story fit into

You It’s firmly a Sci-FiHorror story with an emphasis on Suspense and Drama because of character
interaction

Why different producers specialize in different genres or combination of genres

Inter viewer does your story have a High-Concept

You what lies in shadows have always scared people — shadows represent conjured fears brought up
by one’s imagination when facing the unknown — ‘The Shadows’ threatens ALL life on Earth — because
of this it will appeal to hardcore Sci-FiHorror fans while personal conflicts between characters
grappling with beliefs of who we are as a unique person will appeal to those that love Suspense and

Drama

High-Concept is a unique original idea with mass appeal

TOC

Why the larger the potential audience the more people will be inclined to invest in your story Also
people are looking for a breakout story that captures an audience’s imagination

Inter viewer why is this story relevant to you

You The Universe is complicated I believe life exists thats utterly alien to our biological existence
And Ive always been interested in the interaction between the PAST PRESENT and FUTURE My story
gives a fresh look at what non-biological life might be like in the universe and what dangers await its
discovery if this life could move through time

Why if your story resonates with you emotionally it has a good chance it will with your interviewer —
your job is to make it resonate with the interviewer through your passion for your story

Inter viewer Non-biological life — sounds intriguing — can you expand on this

You I encapsulate this idea which our astrophysicist protagonist gives ina talk on his brothers radio
show ‘The Abyss’ He states that all of reality our reality is really an 8-dimensional crystal projected
as a quasi-crystal on our world forming the substrate of all that exists We know the PAST affects the
PRESENT and the FUTURE — but the Non-biological life in my story has the ability through a theory
called QUANTUM GRAVITY to have our PRESENT or FUTURE change our PAST

Why become an expert on every aspect of your story — remember luck favors the prepared Show your
knowledge of the story The richer more detailed picture you can paint the better the chances your
enthusiasm will rub off

Interviewer give me your storys logline — or in one or two sentences whats the essence of your story

You Humanities fate depends on ones willingness to risk all to unravel the deadly secrets of an alien
malevolence which hunts from the shadows of time

Why shows if you can encapsulate the essence of your story into one or two sentences that captures
one’s imagination — a logline is 20-30 words that encapsulates the heart of the story

Inter viewer Im intrigued tell me more — you have a synopsis

You Our story begins when a shower of deadly crystal meteors strikes remote areas across the world
Soon mysterious deaths from stepping into projected shadows raise tensions between superpowers
mistaking the incidents as hostile acts with a new weapon created by global enemies

At Californias Griffith Park Observatory mixed race CaucasianNative American Phoenix Cota discovers a bizarre crystal fragment dangling froma sundial and a haunting note in a childs
handwriting - We Are Alive At this time he meets Emma a bright and endearing girl on the
autism spectrum who sees the future through visions she doesnt understand

TOC

Phoenix agrees to appear on his half-brother Tucs radio show The Abyss a program dedicated
to the supernatural Tuc has the gift of prophecy but cursed in not believing in his own predictions

On the show Phoenix expounds on an outlandish theory about the quantum emergence of non-
biological life which endangers all life on Earth His talk jeopardizes his degree program and his work
at the observatory

Mentoring as a Big Brother he brings a young student to a childrens book reading being given by
Olympic cyclist Piper Spencer unknowingly Emmas older sister

Sparks fly But under pressure from his Doctoral board to drop his outlandish theory or face being cut
from the program he ends their affair without explanation He resumes his studies in astrophysics at the
University of Hawaii

A year later he returns to California and takes a troop of young boy scouts on a camping excursion into
the Santa Monica mountains where he runs into Emma and an angry Piper

Piper manages a troop of girl scouts at a nearby campsite The two camping troops quickly clash

While rescuing Emma and Piper in the mountains Phoenix discovers an ancient Indian ancestral cave
with cryptic pictographs of crystal travelers

That evening around the campfire a second wave of meteorites strike giving Phoenix firsthand support
of his theory The world again misinterprets them as hostile acts from global superpowers

The world teeters on the edge of nuclear annihilation as world leaders escalate threats and accusations
of weaponizing space

Phoenix logs into ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial Impact Last Alert System) out of Hawaii to analyze
possible global meteor strikes

His non-biological lifes theory strikes home when Emma and Piper are attacked and vanish in the
shadows

The meaning of the childs note We Are Alive along with the mysterious ancient Indian pictographs
strike home Phoenix takes a leap of faith that Piper and Emma are still alive and he risks everything to
enter the crystal world Inside he reunites with the two women as they struggle to avoid the terrible
creatures that roam the passages of time

Piper loses her life helping Phoenix and Emma escape a time shifting guardian that cant be destroyed
They find themselves in Earths desolate near future a world destroyed in a nuclear conflagration

Videos taken by Emma inside the crystal brings forth the knowledge to escape their fate by re-entering
the crystal world and rescuing Piper before she was killed

The trio returns to the day the meteorites first struck Earth to help unite the world against The
Shadows

TOC

Why your Synopsis for a pitch should be 2 to 5 minutes unfolding the story from beginning to end — it
shows you can tell a story that resonates with people and that makes sense — point out interesting twists
in the story - this would usually translate to about to 2 pages of writing

Inter viewer Whats the Theme of your story

You commitment — how a person must sometimes step into the fearful unknown to reach their dreams —
the words of Robert Browning resonates — a mans reach should exceed his grasp or what are dreams
for Any dream worthwhile often requires a one-hundred percent commitment The different characters
represent various aspects of commitment

Why Theme — what is the message you hope the story conveys — the thread that runs through your
story — the hidden meaning behind the dialogue and action - if conveyed well the theme should be
figured out by the audience and not shoved down their throat by the writer

Inter viewer Have you thought of any tagline

You several comes to mind - Stay out of the shadows - A Quiet Place meets The Shadows

Why Taglines — they are usually 3-10 words — catchy phrases that captures the imagination
Examples I’ll be back’ - Terminator ‘Just Do It’— Nike ‘In space no one can hear you scream’ —
Alien

‘Who you going to call’ — Ghostbusters ‘Youll Never Go In The Water Again’—Jaws ‘Be Afraid Be
very afraid’— The Fly ‘Size Does Matter’ — Godzilla ‘A long time ago in a galaxy far far away’ —
Star Wars)

Inter viewer Who do you envision as the leads in the story

You I see a young Tom Cruise would be perfect as the protagonist His portrayal of Jack Harper in
‘Oblivion’ captures the concept of total commitment when he sacrifices himself after he gives his great
speech at the end “And how can man die better than facing fearful odds for the ashes of his fathers and
the temples of his Gods The very essence of commitment

Why the producer will visualize the person in the part and may know someone that comes to mind

Inter viewer In what stage is your story

You J’ve created a pilot script logline taglines theme and put together the first half dozen story lines
of a possible series

Interviewer What other stories have you done

TOC

You I’ve got over a dozen other story scripts that range from horror to comedy from Bollywood to
English drama and everything in-between

Why Often the interviewer is looking for something other than what you are putting forward Here’s
where ‘luck favors the prepared’ really means something When given the opportunity don’t waste it If
you say you don’t then like Keyser Séze the interview will end your connection will vanish - never to
return - an opportunity wasted

Above I covered everything from a 30 second elevator pitch (title and logline) to a 15-30 minute
grilling
A final comment — practice answering these questions and others that you think an interviewer might

come up with Have passion for your project — for passion helps convince people your project is worth
producing
