don’t do it in earnest — do it for fun”

Draft - 19th January 2007
EXT SUBURBAN STREET SYDNEY DAY
Title “Sydney Australia 1967

A broad tree lined street in an affluent suburb of Sydney
A young man is walking up the middle of the street This is
Richard NEVILLE self consciously wearing his “Dylan” jacket
and desert boots trying to be cool but uncertain if hes
actually managed it

RICHARD (V0)
They say if you can remember the
Sixties - you werent really there

He has a rolled up magazine under his arm - and is listening
to a small transistor radio - news of protests in America
about Civil Rights - he flicks the channel - reports of the
conflict in Vietnam - he changes the channel again and
catches a snippet recounting the rolling stones drug bust He
turns off the radio - it’s as if he can’t bear the news of
interesting things elsewhere

RICHARD (V0)
Well I do remember the Sixties
And I was there

He turns onto the lawn of a pristine property and saunters
across the immaculately cut grass quite out of place in this
Perfectly-preened Apple-pie environment

RICHARD (VO)
And it was the same as any other
time really

To the subliminal sounds of Simon and Garfunkel He puts on
some Raybans as he walks into the house

INT THE NEVILLE HOUSE THE SAME

Richard slouches through the hallway past the exhibition of
family photos and into the living room

RICHARD (VO)

A whole generation of parents who
felt they’d sacrificed their youth
for their children

We see Col Neville his father who is impeccably dressed in
a blazer and tie Richard’s Mother a little more bohemian in
her muumuu and a neighbour in a cream twin set They are
decorously drinking coffee and looking at family snaps of
Richard in his graduation ceremony

RICHARD (V0)
-and a generation of children who
wondered why they’d bothered
sacrificing anything at all to have
so little fun
COL NEVILLE
Morning Richard

RICHARD
(sullenly)
Morning Dad

NEIGHBOUR
The Colonel was just telling us
about your graduation Richard
So have you any idea what youre
going to do for a career

The very word strikes fear into Richard’s soul

RICHARD
To be quite honest I haven’t really
decided

MOTHER
(indulgently)
Besides hes perfectly happy here
having a little time off with us
Arent you dear

Angle on Richard - this is clearly not the case
INT STAIRWAY THE SAME

Richard walks upstairs The Simon and Garfunkel still lilting
suggestively in the background He comes to a door marked
with a twee sign saying “Richard” He goes in

INT RICHARDS BEDROOM THE SAME

Richards room is an Aladdin‘s cave There are wall to
ceiling posters of the Rolling Stones Bob Dylan the
Beatles We scan the wall and see a pinned up copy of the
Sydney Uni Times There is a picture of Richard smiling with
another Dylanesque guy - someone has “signed” the paper with
a flower and the words ” from Martin”

Richard goes to a record player He puts down the needle on
an album already on the deck The sound of “MY GENERATION”
bursts out of the speakers - a massive jolt from the Simon
and Garfunkel twiddlings Richard throws himself on the bed
and opens his copy of the magazine he was carrying It is a
British copy of the “New Musical Express” — he opens it at a
centre spread which has a picture of the Kinks in Piccadilly
Circus with the headline SWINGING London

INT SYDNEY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT DAY

The Colonel and Mrs Neville dressed impeccably are saying
goodbye to Richard
MRS NEVILLE
Oh I nearly forgot - will you give
this to Jill

Mrs Neville takes a jar of vegemite out of her handbag

RICHARD
Mum Jill is a grown up member of
London’s intelligentsia She
doesnt want Vegemite for godsake

MRS NEVILLE
Believe me Richard Everybody
needs Vegemite especially when
they’re 12000 miles from home

Mrs Neville straightens his collar

MRS NEVILLE
Youll be alright won’t you
Richard You wont get in any
trouble

RICHARD
Of course Ill be alright Mum
I really have to go

He hugs her perfunctorily She wipes something off his cheek
by licking her handkerchief and applying it to the horrified
Richard He turns to his father

COL NEVILLE
Wellgood luck Richard

Col Neville doesn’t quite know what to say Richard looks at
him equally awkwardly The Colonel finally grabs him and pats
Richards back in a self-conscious hug Richard seems more
bewildered than moved by his father’s unusual display of
affection He nods his appreciation then goes As Richard
walks away through the departures gate his mother wipes the
tears from her eyes

MRS NEVILLE
Do you think he’1ll be alright
darling

COL NEVILLE
I very much doubt it

INT DEPARTURES THE AIRPORT THE SAME

We follow Richard closely he is still tense from the
awfulness of public intimacy with his parents He shows his
passport and enters the safety of the departure area We move
with him as he walks away He does not look back but
gradually his whole face relaxes
His stride gains confidence his mouth breaks into a broad
smile of liberation For the first time Richard is himself
hopeful generous easy going We know the film has started -

Cue the title song Hippie Hippie Shake and credits roll as
Richard beams his way down the long corridor

INT QUANTAS 747 DAY

The credits continue over Richard squeezed into an economy
seat his desert boots perched on the seat in front of him
On his knee he is resting a notebook He writes” Things to
do 1 Find Martin Sharp 2 Get a girlfriend” - he thinks
about this then crosses this out and writes “ Get laid 3”
He ponders then writes confidently “Change the world” He
looks up to see an attractive stewardess looking down at him
He smiles up at her

AUSSIE AIRHOSTESS
(sternly)
Feet off the seats please

Richards smile drops

RICHARD
(politely)
Sorry

INT PASSPORT CONTROL HEATHROW DAY

The HIPPIE HIPPIE SHAKE song and credits continue as a very
tired Richard hands over his passport to an officer wearing a
ginger toupee

OFFICER
Purpose of visit

RICHARD
Sex drugs some rock and roll
then I thought I‘d bring down the
government

The Officer does not smile

OFFICER
Don’t get clever with me sunshine
I didn’t get my arse shot off in
Arnhem to put up with prats like
you

The officer stamps his passport
INT AIRPORT THE SAME
Richard spills into the arrivals hall bustling with people

People push past him It is chaotic and noisy Richard is
bleary eyed with exhaustion
INT COMMUNTER TRAIN EARLY MORNING

The song and Titles continue over Richard squashed in a
carriage train He looks over at an a young man obviously the
same age as himself wearing a pin-stripe suit They look into
one another‘’s eyes Richard looks away as a hip looking dude
gets on Richard looks over and smiles The hip dude cuts him
dead

EXT VICTORIA STATION DAY

More song and titles as Richard comes out of the station
buffeted by the crowds of people rushing to work Dolly birds
in mini-skirts fly past pneumatic drills blast away
snatches of the Beatles can be heard through the din London
is a chaos of activity and noise

INT ROUTEMASTER BUS THE SAME

Richard horribly uncomfortable with his suitcase on his
knee The bus stops abruptly throwing Richard onto two Zoot
Suited Jamaicans who are not amused

RICHARD
Sorry

EXT POWIS SQUARE THE SAME

Richard gets off the bus and starts to hump his suitcase
along the street past the peeling stuccoed terraces Stray
dogs loiter next to overflowing bins Raggedy arsed kids are
playing football He passes a window - a sign says “No
Blacks No Dogs No Irish”

As he wanders along Richard looks at a piece of paper with
Martins address finally he stops He looks up at a door It
has been painted with a picture of the Yellow Brick Road
tailing off into infinity - a bit of bright colour and
surreal humour in an otherwise down-at-heel street

Richard knocks on the door Waits There is no answer He
knocks again Nothing He goes to the window and peers
inside He can‘t see anything He moves further round the
window and sees it is open He pushes it up and sticks his
head inside

RICHARD
Hello Martin

No answer -— so he grabs his suitcase and climbs in
INT MARTIN’S FLAT THE SAME
Richard looks round - the room is a mess Books and albums

are strewn across the floor Crumpled clothes lie amongst
ashtrays full of butts
The Beatles Rubber Soul is playing on a dansette there is a
Buddhist poster is on the wall Suddenly a girls voice
surprises him

A GIRL’S VOICE 0S
The money’s under the mattress

He spins round in shock slips on a copy of “Steppenwolf” and
falls over He looks up to see a girl in the bath across the
hall She is smoking a joint

RICHARD
Terribly sorry

GERMAINE
Can I help you

RICHARD
Actually I was looking for Martin
Sharp

GERMAINE

Tough luck sunshine he’s out
Don’t tell me youre another
earnest virgin come to start a
revolution

Richard gets up

RICHARD
Actually I’m a very good friend of
his from Sydney University - I may
be many things but I am definitely
not earnest Richard Neville

Richard proffers his hand Germaine ignores it and stands up

GERMATNE
Germaine Greer Hold this

She passes him the joint as she grabs a towel

RICHARD
So are you Martin’s girlfriend

GERMAINE
For god‘s sake do I look like
somebodys girlfriend Pair bonded
relationships are about as
reactionary as it gets dont you
think

Richard nods as if he knows what a “pair bonded relationship”
is - then takes a drag of the joint which causes a coughing
fit

GERMAINE
Are you alright
RICHARD
(coughing badly)
I‘ll be fine
(he eventually recovers)
So do you have any idea where he

is

GERMAINE
Christ knows Haven’t seen him for
days

Richard passes the joint back sheepishly

RICHARD
Thank you

GERMAINE
I don’t suppose you fancy a fuck
do you

He stares at her like a rabbit caught in the headlights

RICHARD
Well actually I’m a bit you
know “shagged out” after all that
travelling

GERMAINE
Please yourself I’m going to the
library

Suddenly there is a noise behind him The door flies open and
a long haired character in a great-coat staggers in It is
the same guy from the Sydney Uni Times picture but he looks
completely different Wilder cooler and like he hasn’t slept
for days

MARTIN
Oh my bastard head

He grabs the joint off Germaine and flops onto the sofa and
inhales most of the joint in one drag

GERMAINE
Youve got a visitor

Richard looks at him amazed at how he’s changed

RICHARD
Martin

Martin tries to focus on the figure in front of him
MARTIN

Richard fucking Neville
What the hell are you doing here
INT PUB EARLS COURT LATE AFTERNOON

Martin has a pint of beer and a gin chaser on the bar
throughout the conversation he is doodling (brilliantly) on a
beer mat

RICHARD
You said I should look you up
MARTIN
But I didn’t actually expect you to
come
RICHARD

You didn’t think I’d stay in Sydney
did you How could I not come The
“Northern Renaissance” “Swinging
London” and all that

MARTIN
Richard Forget it London’s swung

RICHARD
What do you mean London’s swung

Martin knocks back the chaser and orders another one

MARTIN
Finished Over Swung Kaput Its
all wannabe Herman’s Hermits and
wankers in Union Jack waistcoats

Silence

RICHARD
So what have you been doing for the
last four months

MARTIN
Not a lot Pissed about read a bit
of Epicurus and smoked three kilos
of marijuana Like I said It’s a
bust

RICHARD
But what about the artistic
commune What about your painting
You were the best artist Sydneys
ever had Martin You were the
only artist Sydney’s ever had You
can’t be washed up at 25

MARTIN
Im not washed up - I‘m gestating

Martin knocks back the second chaser and finishes his beer
Richard is clearly not happy
MARTIN
Anyway anything interesting’s
coming out of San Francisco Come
on

He sticks the beer mat with his “tag” doodle into Richard’s
pocket

EXT LEAFY NORTH LONDON STREET EVENING

Martin offers Richard a joint as they walk along Richard
declines

RICHARD
But I didn’t come 12000 miles to
mope about in a bedsit What about
Vietnam Civil Rights Shouldn‘t we
at least be out there trying to
change the things

MARTIN
Who the hell‘s gonna listen

Martin takes a toke on the joint

MARTIN
I think you’11 find the worlds
made up of grey people who see
everything in black and white
We’re not at Uni now Richard

They have stopped at a house

RICHARD
Exactly if it’s so bloody grey put
some colour into it

MARTIN
You don’t get it do you Nobody
gives a toss If anything’s gonna
change Richard - its gonna change
in the mind

Martin stops takes a final huge toke on the joint and throws
it away

MARTIN
I think this is it

They look up at a bourgeois house
He goes up the steps and rings the doorbell

RICHARD
OK I’1l1 see you later

MARTIN
“See you later” The only reason I
came with you was to get a free
supper

RICHARD
(as he rings the bell)
But you hate my sister

MARTIN
Correction - she hates me - I
always thought she was kinda foxy -
anyway I dropped half a dozen Black
Bombers in the pub - I‘11 be fine

Martin smiles beatifically The door opens - it is Jill
Neville in an evening dress Richard looks in horror at
Martin - then turns to Jill

JILL
Richie darling
MARTIN
(beaming a stoned smile)
Hi
JILL
(mildly horrified)
Oh

INT JILL NEVILLES HOUSE NIGHT

A bourgeois dinner table full of posh middle aged portly
Politicos Jill Neville introduces Richard to the group
Martin is sitting in a glazed daze

JILL
This is George - famous Jazz
singer art collector and
professional contrarian Paul who
edits the New Statesman John
Mortimer - QC champagne radical
and internationally famous
playwright and Edward who is
writing a book about lateral
thinking This is my little
brother Richie He’s just flown in
from Australia

RICHARD
Hi

JILL
(looking at Martin)
And this is Richie’s friend Martin
He’s also from Australia

Martin is unable to acknowledge anything Richard takes the
vegemite from his pocket to cover the embarrassment

RICHARD
I’m really sorry about this but
Mum made me bring it

JILL
Thank the fucking Lord — I thought
I was going to die without it Do
start

Richard tries to eat his prawn cocktail daintily Martin
however seems to be staring into space Richard is horrified

JILL
Is he alright Richard

RICHARD
Yes - I think he’s meditating

JILL
Anyway - welcome to Radical London

Richard looks across anxiously at Martin who starts to eat
the prawn cocktail straight from the bowl by pouring it down
like a shot of vodka They all try to ignore him

MORTIMER
So Paul What is this about a
contract with Routledge

PAUL
Three book deal actually Hardly a
fortune but itll keep me in good
claret Anyway - I was going to
give you the address of a very good
tailor I stumbled into on
Saturdays demo

Richard is smiling whilst watching Martin in horror
Suddenly Edward de Bono addresses him directly catching him
completely off his guard

EDWARD DE BONO
I suppose you’re another Aussie
upstart come to “spark the
revolution”

RICHARD
Well actually -

EDWARD DE BONO
Or join a pop group Isn’t that
what young people do

PAUL
Yes come on Richard what exactly
have you young energetic creative
powerhouses come here for

Suddenly the entire dinner party has stopped They all look
at him expectantly

RICHARD
Well -

He looks at their condescending faces A social panic attack
He doesn’t know what to say but he reaches into the depths of
his subconscious

RICHARD (CONTD)
Im starting a new magazine

Richard is as surprised at this as everybody else

JILL
Goodness

RICHARD
Yes

JILL

On your own

RICHARD
No - with Martin He’s going to be
Art Director We used to produce
one at Uni

JILL looks sceptically at Martin He is complete off his
tits

RICHARD
He‘’s very good at art

JILL
Really

They all look back at Richard rather concerned
EDWARD DE BONO
So what are you intending to focus
on exactly
He has no idea
RICHARD
I wasnt really sure Something for

young people

They look at him more closely

RICHARD
about things that are going on

Martin butts in

MARTIN
Basically anything thats not in
the New Statesman

They all look at Martin Richard’s face drops at Martins
totally unhelpful intervention

EDWARD DE BONO

Well it takes a lot more to edit a
Magazine than looking like Bob
Dylan

EXT TRAFALGAR SQUARE MORNING

Richard and Martin are sitting on the head of a lion watching
the tourists and pigeons below

RICHARD
What the hell did you say that for

MARTIN
I don’t know what youre so wound
up about He was a complete arse
Anyway why the hell did you
bullshit them about “a magazine” in
the first place

RICHARD
They had me in a corner - I had to
say something - I couldnt
embarrass myself in front of my
sister could I

MARTIN
You should have thought about that
before you announced the date of
publication Now he’s going to
write it up in an editorial
dickwad

RICHARD
Well - perhaps it’s not such a bad
idea anyway

MARTIN
Richard it’s the worst idea in the
entire history of human rumination

RICHARD
It worked at Uni

MARTIN
Richard we did two issues before
they closed it down The last thing
anyone wants is another magazine
Who the fuck wants to hear what
weve got to say Look at them
they’re all Alfs Alfs

RICHARD
There must be hundreds of people
out there like us - looking for
something else If the most
radical thing you can read is
edited by that old fuckwit maybe
we could make a difference

He passes Richard the joint - he refuses

MARTIN
Look - we should be taking
industrial quantities of drugs and
having as much sex as possible

RICHARD
That‘s what I’m saying sex drugs
and rock and roll - that’s exactly
what the magazine should be about
Look if you’re not interested
fine I11 do it myself then

MARTIN
OK but you’re not doing it at my
house

INT DINGY FLAT DAY

Richard and Martin look round the basement flat Martin
smoking a joint

RICHARD
What do you reckon

MARTIN
It’s an absolute shit hole What
this place needs is a lick of
paint

Richard suddenly ducks as Martin throws a can of paint across
the room

CUT TO

Later Martin and Richard throw paint around the flat
creating a walk-in day-glo Jackson Pollock Finally they
fall over one another and end up in a hysterical heap on the
floor Martin looks up to survey their handiwork

RICHARD
(laughing hysterically and
with great affection)
You stupid fucking idiot Martin
Sharp

MARTIN
(lighting a joint)
But I thought it’s just the grown
up sober ambience you were looking
for

Richard puts a final can of paint over Martins head The
paint runs down his face Martin unphased takes a drag of
the spliff

CuT TO

A week later Richard sits attentively behind a makeshift
desk He looks at his watch Martin skulks in the corner
smoking on a battered old arm chair

RICHARD
Who would have thought eh Wed
both end up here in London starting
up an underground magazine

MARTIN
You do realise no one’s going to
come

RICHARD

Youll see in a minute this place
will be swarming with the most
brilliant minds of our generation

There is a knock on the door Jim a lanky hippie with waist
length hair appears wearing a mandala and a lord of the rings
badge

JIM
Hey is this where the new hip
magazine’s edited

RICHARD
Please come in

JIM
Nice walls You could really get
into trouble if you were tripping

Martin raises his eyebrow Richard looks round more hopeful
as Another person comes through the door but is disappointed
to see it is Germaine Germaine is disappointed to see it is
Richard and Martin

GERMAINE
The poster said it was going to be
intelligent dynamic and original

MARTIN
Don’t get at me - I’m only here as
moral support

Then through the door comes widge - a radical student type
with badges for any number of issues pinned to his Oxfam
jacket

WIDGERY
Is this the non-aligned satirical
magazine with a wide range of
political content

RICHARD
Yes

MARTIN
No You’re not a student by any
chance

WIDGERY

What gave you that impression

RICHARD
Please come in Ignore him he’s
got nothing to do with this

CUT TO

Germaine Widgery Jim and Richard are sitting round the
table - slightly nervous Martin is still in the battered
armchair looking on in amusement as Richard tries to
officiate Richard looks at his watch again then

RICHARD
Well this looks like it’s it I
think we better get started Why
don‘t we go round in a circle and
say what wed like to write about
Jim

JIM
I dont know really Spirituality
the supernatural I’m particularly
interested in Buddhism and Elves

RICHARD

Elves
JIM
Yes — I think traditional British
mysticism’s been unfairly
marginalised I am very keen on
Druids

RICHARD
I see we’ll come back to you

He looks at his sheet to check the next name -

WIDGE
Widge Vietnam Human Rights the
Black Struggle in America
exploitation of the poor the
colonisation of the third world

MARTIN
Youre not a student by any chance

WIDGE
Im studying medicine as a matter
of fact What’s that got to do with
anything

MARTIN
Just asking

RICHARD
Germaine So what would you like to
write about

GERMAINE
cunt

RICHARD
Sorry

GERMAINE

How can we think we’re different
from our parents when weve got
exactly the same attitude towards
women’s sexuality

MARTIN
Meet Germaine - promiscuitys
answer to the Vietcong

GERMAINE
How can you claim to be radicals if
you don’t even know how to fuck us
properly

MARTIN
And she’s got a PhD

JIM
OK So who’s gonna be editor

RICHARD
Well me It was my idea

JIM
Isn‘t that like really
reactionary

RICHARD
Course it’s not reactionary -
somebody’s got to be in charge

WIDGERY
But isn’t that just aping the very
power structures were seeking to
undermine

RICHARD
Look - if nobodys in charge
nothing1l ever get done OK We’1l
all be co-editors Germaine can
have a sex column and Jim can do
something about Druids and -

WIDGERY
What is this the Hobbit Times I
thought this was going to be a
serious magazine

RICHARD
Look the whole point of the
Magazine is that it has politics
drugs sex music And Druids for
christsake The whole point is -
it’s not about one thing - it’s
about everything It’s about what
everybody else leaves out Its
about recognising it’s just as
important to be free in your mind
as it is to be free in the world
What you do with your body’s as
important as what you do with your
imagination You can’t have sex
without the politics drugs without
talking about spirituality The
whole point is that there is
something for everybody

Everybody seems impressed by Richard’s speech until it is
punctured by Martin

MARTIN
Stop trying to please everybody all
the time Richard

(MORE)

MARTIN (contd)
You should be upsetting people -
doing the completely unexpected -
you need to make every issue
something no one’s ever seen
before

JIM
Like thematise the issues

MARTIN
No - I don’t mean “thematise the
issues” -— I mean make each issue a
different shape - make every one a
different colour — make one a
poster - print one on a toilet roll

RICHARD
(to Martin)
Look -— you’re not even on the
editorial committee so just butt
out

JIM
So what are we going to call it

RICHARD
I was thinking about Oz

Everybody is non-plussed

RICHARD
A utopian land of possibility
removed from humdrum reality where
fantasy can finally merge with
desire

Nobodys buying it

RICHARD
It also means Australia

WIDGERY
It‘s shit

JIM
It’s cool

GERMATNE
Fuck it - it’ll do

WIDGE
Agreed

MARTIN
OK - let’s all go and get stoned

Suddenly here is a knock on the door They all look round A
beautiful girl in rather dowdy girl-next door type clothes
pops her head round the door

LOUISE
Sorry Am I a bit late

RICHARD
Bloody hell Arent you Louise
Ferrier From university

LOUISE

Oh my goodness Richard Neville
What are you doing here

CUT TO

INT RICHARD’S KITCHEN - LATER

Richard is trying to make a cup of tea He gets her a chair
in a flourish of inappropriate etiquette

RICHARD (CONTD)
Please sit down

LOUISE
Really I should go

RICHARD
No please I can’t believe youve
only been here three weeks too

She sits

LOUISE
It’s just so weird that you’re here
too To be honest I’m amazed you
remember me

RICHARD
Of course I remember you - you gave
that excellent paper about Romantic
poetry

LOUISE
To be quite honest I didn‘t think
anybody noticed me at Uni

RICHARD
of course I noticed you I mean —
you had a very interesting take on
Wordsworth actually

LOUISE
Coleridge

RICHARD
Thats right I can’t believe it
You were always so aloof so
perfect and here you are in my
kitchen

LOUISE
I always thought that you and the
gang around the newspaper were the
aloof ones I think youll find Im
boringly normal actually

RICHARD
Yes of course I mean No I mean -
Wow So you’re going to write for
the magazine

LOUISE
God no I wouldn’t know where to
start

RICHARD

Of course you would - you could
write anything you wanted

LOUISE
Really I’m not sure it’s my thing

RICHARD
What is your thing exactly

LOUISE
I suppose thats what I came to
find out I woke up one day ina
bedroom filled with pink fluffy
things and realised if I didn’t do
something about it I would become
more like my Mum than my Mum was
All my life Id done exactly as I
was told and it was about time I
did what I wanted to do

RICHARD
And what do you want

LOUISE
I dunno - to make difference - do
something important

RICHARD
That’s just the same as me

LOUISE

I think it’s the same as everybody
You must be very pleased with how
it went I mean I liked your
friend Martin actually

RICHARD
Hes a bit of a dilettante
actually

LOUISE

It’s an incredible feeling isn’t
it Thinking you might actually be
able to change things make a real
difference but knowing you might
completely screw it up

Richard looking at Louise - thinking exactly the same thing
about her rather than the magazine

LOUISE
Have you thought how incredibly
rare it is - in the entire history
of mankind — to actually feel free

RICHARD
I supposed it is Yes

LOUISE
Well anyway I’1l just be happy to
hang out Make myself useful

RICHARD (CONTD)

Cool you just - you know - “hang”
as much as you want To your hearts
content No pressure Honestly

Richard does a bad impression of playing it cool - he runs
out of steam An awkward pause

LOUISE
Well I best be going

RICHARD
Please let me show you out

He fumbles his way to the door embarrassing himself with his
over solicitude

RICHARD
Well it’s very nice to see you
again Bye Bye

As soon as she’s gone he violently berates himself

RICHARD (CONTD)
Stupid stupid arsehole

Suddenly the toilet door opens and Martin is sitting smoking
a huge spliff

MARTIN
Youve got no chance you know that
-— don’t you

Richard looks at Martin

MARTIN
My advice is to blow the whole
thing off and come down the UFO
club with me

RICHARD
(friendly)
Look piss off Martin

INT OZ OFFICE AKA RICHARD’S FRONT ROOM DAY

Fast cut images Richard and Widge bring in an old layout
board Jim paints a big “Oz” on the wall The gang sans
Martin are gathered

RICHARD
OK Issue One

Cue Born to be Wild by Steppenwolf
CUT TO

Richard typing frantically at the golfball typewriter whilst
Jim lays things out on the floor Louise delivers a cup of
tea to Richard He smiles at her coolly

RICHARD

LOUISE
I think Psychedelic has a ‘y’

Richard looks at his typing totally embarrassed He tears the
paper out of the typewriter to start again Germaine typing
away — a pile of learned tomes by her typewriter

More tea is served Piles of scrunched up paper have
accumulated by Richard He is looking frazzled Germaine is
still typing studiously and serene Jim is rolling a very
large spliff Widge is trying to work out how to work the
layout board Germaine takes her copy out of the typewriter
and hands it to Richard proudly

GERMAINE
See you in the morning

The music stops It is Night Cups have accumulated ashtrays
have overflown Jim is passed out across the desk Widge is
asleep in his chair over a medical text book Richard is
literally nodding off over his typewriter - He finishes what
he is typing He takes it over to the layout board

RICHARD
(trying to impress Louise)
OK Now for the fun bit

Richard leans across the layout board to stick the first
article in place But it tips backwards sending everything
falling to the floor

RICHARD
Shit

Louise is on hand to help pick everything up They brush
together

CUT TO

Richard at the layout board Louise behind him looking on
warming her hands on a nice cup of tea Richard very
awkwardly cutting a piece of typed paper is completely
distracted by her We still haven’t seen anything on the page
yet

INT 0Z OFFICES LONDON MORNING

Next morning Richard Louise Jim Widgery and Germaine all
look proudly at the mock up of magazine In tiny writing it
says Oz - the rest of the magazine is just columns and
columns of type

RICHARD
The very first issue
GERMAINE
It’s like the Times circa 1780

WIDGERY
She’s right

RICHARD
But you have to admit its pretty
neat — considering

LOUISE
Richard It’s absolutely hopeless

JIM
What are we going to do

EXT MARTINS FLAT AFTERNOON

Jim Louise Richard and Widgery are outside Martin’s flat
Widgery knocks on Martin‘s door Nothing

LOUISE

RICHARD
Forget it We can get in through
here

INT MARTINS FLAT THE SAME

Richard et al climb through the window and look around at the
room

WIDGERY
What a dump

Martin is asleep on the mattress in the centre of the room
He has suspended a whole galaxy of silver stars above the bed
-— all suspended on strings Jim knocks over a lamp as he
climbs in Martin wakes up

MARTIN
Richard

A girl appears from under the sheets

RICHARD
Hello

GIRL
Hi

LOUISERICHARDWIDGERY JIM
Hi

RICHARD
I hope we werent interrupting
anything

Then a second girl appears

2ND GIRL
Hi

LOUISERICHARDWIDGERYJIM

Hi

RICHARD
Its just weve hit a problem with
the magazine

MARTIN
What magazine

Then a third girl emerges

LOUISERICHARDWIDGERYJIM

Hi

THIRD GIRL
Is anything the matter

MARTIN
It’s alright - go back to sleep
darling
(to Richard)
To be quite honest Im a bit busy
right now

Martin looks up at Louise

LOUISE
Please

She is impossible to resist
INT RICHARD’S BASEMENT DAY

Martin rather blearily looks at the magazine He studies it
with great concentration Then

MARTIN
It looks like the Times circa 1780

RICHARD
We know

MARTIN
It’s pretty neat - considering

RICHARD
So you think it’s basically OK

MARTIN
It’s completely fucking
unredeemable

LOUISE
We thought you could somehow make
it sort of wild and beautiful

MARTIN
You do realise I could be getting
laid by Joe Cocker’s entire female
backing line up

He takes the magazine and some scissors Everyone watches his
every move in studious concentration He hesitates then
can’t go through with it They all hold their breath
disappointed Then suddenly Martin picks up the scissors
again and starts cutting it up in an indiscriminate manner
Like Edward Scissorhands he wildly continues to cut the
first page into an insane but interesting shape Everybody
watches him in deadly earnest He sits at the layout table
and stares at it The letters spell out “The Theological
Striptease”

RICHARD
What the hell are you doing

MARTIN
I don’t fucking know

Suddenly we see inspiration strike and he leaps up to rummage
in the wastepaper bin and starts to cut up photos froma
magazine The others watch him fascinated Martin is clearly
on a roll He cuts pastes with a fantastic concentration
Everyone else is crowded round him

MARTIN
(like a surgeon at work)
Spliff

A spliff is passed to him

MARTIN
Scalpel

A scalpel is passed He crops a picture

MARTIN
Glue

Glue is passed - he takes a huge sniff then puts it down We
see the look in his eye cue Voodoo chile (slight return) by
Jimi Hendrix We move in to see in detail what he is doing
We see Martin’s fingers cutting and pasting in microscopic
close up The layout becomes almost a landscape and we
observe the minute detail The edges of the paper have become
cliff faces the marks of his pen are rivers of ink Finally
we focus so far that the whole thing has become abstract
colour and we Suddenly pull out to see the fantastic montage
Detailed intricate vivid and brilliant We are suddenly
back in the real world of the Oz office Martin at the
drawing-board swaying from his efforts

JIM
Fucking hell

LOUISE
It’s amazing

RICHARD
You fucking did it Martin

Louise kisses Richard Richard can’t believe his luck

LOUISE
Youre a genius Martin

Louise kisses Martin Richard is less pleased with Louises
appraisal of Martin

WIDGERY
To youth imagination

GERMAINE
-- and impropriety

They all cheer as Martin collapses onto the desk exhausted

RICHARD
OK -— let’s go and blow some minds

EXT STREET WAPPING DAY

A Richard Lester” type speeded up sequence where Richard and
Jim on a tandem cycle to a backstreet printers go in come
straight back out again with piles of magazines put them
precariously on the back of the bike and cycle away again

EXT LONDON STREETS DAY

Jim outside a tube station with the magazine It starts to
rain

cur TO

Richard down the Kings Road A wannabe Hermans Hermit
completely snubs him Louise in her duffle coat is further
down the Kings Road Two girls walk by in afghan coats but
ignore her She looks disheartened but an old lady with a
shopping basket on wheels buys a copy

CUT TO

Widgery outside the factory gates - along side donkey
JACKETED guys selling the morning star the international
socialist the Workers times etc No one is interested in
Og

CUT TO

Germaine at the university library - selling the magazine
She starts chatting to a hip guy who buys the magazine They
continue chatting and finally Germaine puts the magazines in
her bag and they go off together

CUT TO

Martin in a club - he is dancing furiously On the table
behind him are his copies of the magazine A hip looking
young guy sits down - notices it - picks it up and starts
reading Martin dances on oblivious

CUT TO

Richard getting disillusioned But a couple of sixteen year
old kids with long hair and kaftan tops who we will later
meet as Charles Shaar Murray and Vivian Berger club together
and buy a single copy from Louise

CUT TO

It is now night Jim is still in the same position as the
tube traffic is coming the other way

INT PUB NIGHT

Richard Martin Widgery Jim and Germaine all sit at the
table which is piled with unsold copies and a small pile of
coins They all look glum Louise puts something on the
jukebox and joins the solemn group

RICHARD
Its hopeless It’s barely enough
to get a round in

MARTIN
Rome wasn’t built in a day At
least weve got something to build
on

Then across comes a hairy gnome holding a copy of the
Magazine

FELIX
What you need is a few more tarts
with their tits out and a lot more
rock‘n roll If you want to sell
the next issue

They all look round

RICHARD
Actually there isn’t going to be a
next issue

LOUISE
We only managed to sell thirty four
copies and three of them were to
Widgery’s Mum

FELIX
Fucking intellectuals You don’t
have a clue do you Give them to
me I‘11 sell them for you

LOUISE
How are you going to do that

INT BIBA DAY

The impossibly trendy mecca for the cool and trendy Martin
flirting with an assistant at the till Widge Richard Jim
and Felix wait outside a changing room

RICHARD
Itll never work

WIDGERY
Its sexist exploitation

FELIX
Trust me on this one

Suddenly the curtains open and Louise appears with Germaine
in a hippie top and a very short skirt Martin sees her and
walks over

WIDGERY
Bloody hell

LOUISE
It‘s a bit short isnt it

FELIX
Thats the whole fucking point
luv What do you think Richie

RICHARD
I think it’s very attractive

GERMAINE
Thats why it’s ten pounds fifty

Germaine gives Richard the price tag

RICHARD
Why do I have to pay for it

FELIX
Think of it as an investment

Felix gives Louise a pile of magazines

FELIX
Remember All you say is “Have you
got your copy of Oz yet” Off you
go - think revolution
(to Germaine)
You can appeal to the intellect

GERMAINE
Arsehole

EXT KINGS ROAD DAY

Louise on the King’s Road They are inundated with (Male)
customers We see Louise’s expression go from nervousness to
pleasure Germaine is much more matter of fact this time
standing her ground

Further down Richard and Martin outside a pub gaging at
Louise

MARTIN
Who‘dve thought eh

Felix is in the distance running round bossing everybody
about with his piles of the magazine

MARTIN
He‘s a right little tosser

RICHARD
He’s a fucking genius

INT OZ GARDEN LONDON DAY

The group are drinking at a table with a huge pile of money
in the centre

LOUISE
To Felix

WIDGERY
To Oz

JIM

To the redefinition of values
inspired by a raising of spiritual
consciousness

Felix looks askance at Jim

MARTIN
To Louise’s legs

GERMAINE
(encouraging everyone to
join in)

Louises legs

We focus on Richards EMBARRASSMENT at having to acknowledge
his attraction to Louise and her legs

EVERYONE
Louise’s legs

Louise giggles delightedly at being the centre of attention

FELIX
OK — issue two

Louise puts down her drink and is joined by Richard -
slightly apart from the group

RICHARD
Are you OK about this

LOUISE
Well it’s all for a good cause

She takes the glass out of Richard’s hand and knocks back the
contents

RICHARD
I mean you don‘t have to do it - if
youre worried about the
neighbours

LOUISE
No I want to do it

Martin pipes up He is in the middle of the garden with a
camera on a tripod

MARTIN
Jesus Christ Richard I thought we
were fomenting a cultural
revolution

Back on Louise as she is about to take her top off On
Richard stood next to her almost overcome by it all
Germaine smoking a joint offers her encouragement

GERMAINE
All the way kid youve got
nothing to be embarrassed about

Louise is emboldened and hands her bra to Richard Richard
looks at the bra Louise walks away towards Martin and stands
self-consciously in the middle of the garden using her hands
to shield her breasts

LOUISE (CONTD)
I don’t believe Im doing this

WIDGERY
(can’t take his eyes off
her)
I dont believe she doing this

They all watch as Martin kneels down and delicately paints
his signature flower pattern around Louise’s belly button
Richard looks wistfully at Louise who giggles as Martin
gently finishes his flower lingering over its execution He
steps back to admire his handiwork He looks into Louises
eyes for a second - there is a little moment where Martins
cool is undone Richard spots this Martin retreats behind
the camera as a safety screen to real feelings

LOUISE
(as Martin looks through
the lens)

So how do I look

MARTIN
(sincerely)
Like youre at the beginning of a
whole new age

Louise looks at him

MARTIN
Youre allowed to smile

Louise smiles

The radio which has been playing throughout the scene
starts playing the Beatles’ Revolution

Martin takes a picture - we see it A snap shot of Louise
with Richard in the background looking on - beyond smitten
We run through the stills of the photoshoot Louise becoming
ever more confident — till we rest on the photo of her
holding a sunflower which becomes the famous Oz poster Plant
a flower child It captures Louises flowering into a child
of the sixties

Louises picture is on Martins drawing-board Close up of
his hands as he lovingly lays one Louise on top of another
he makes the “Hallucinogenic image” of the kaleidoscope of
Louises

When the image is finished it suddenly moves off the screen
followed by more and more - an endless run of Louises running
through a printing press

Piles of Oz magazines with Louise looking out from the cover

INT NEWSAGENTS DAY

A newsagent is thumbing a copy of the magazine skeptically
The newsagent unfolds the Poster and hold it up The picture
of Louise winks at him He folds it back up and looks at
Felix who is standing expectantly

NEWSAGENT
OK But if I get any trouble

EXT KINGS ROAD DAY

Richard Martin and Louise walking past shop after shop all
have the posters of Louise in the window - with little signs
saying “Oz sold here”

EXT OZ GARDEN DAY

SUPER 8 footage of Richard Louise Martin Felix and
Germaine who are making a Parody of Bob Dylan‘s placard

routine

Louise and Richard holding the signs

“Oz Rules -
There are no rules”
Then Louise Richard and Martin each with the signs

a

“BR hand on your cock”
trigger”

-is more fun than a finger” “- ona
Then Martin and Louise larking around Louise appears to be
enjoying Martins company they both hold the sign

“Lower standards now” While Richard is looking on
Then Louise is standing alone with a sign saying
“Be realistic demand the impossible”
We close in on Richard - dare he reveal himself to Louise
Now Germaine has an insanely long placard -

“I take my desires for reality because I believe in the
reality of my desires”

Jim has a sign saying “Love Thy neighbour”
Germaine holds a sign “fuck thy neighbour”

Germaine then sticks out her arse towards Martin who snaps a
picture

CUT TO

Jim selling each issue of Oz to the same customer - each time
his hair gets longer sideburns bushier and dress more crazy
In the background we see the local bobby getting more and
more perplexed as the characters around him get weirder and
weirder

CUT TO

A long shot of Kings Road and we see it turn (rather like a
stop-motion film of a flower growing and coming to bloom in
front of our very eyes) from a typical London street to the
blossoming of flower power

CUT TO

Martin comes out of one shop with one girl then goes into
another and comes out with a second girl and so we are able
to tell the story of Martins hedonistic love life Where at
the beginning there was the odd hippie - now it is totally
crammed with the psychedelic butterflies Martin walks along
with another flowerpower dolly bird

CUT TO

The Oz office — Martin and Jim drop acid as we see a close up
of another picture of Louise it is in the magazine then we
flick through the pages to see exactly what an issue of Oz
is On each page the pictures come to life they are moving
There are animated Robert Crumb drawings a Victorian medical
diagram of a vagina bands freaking out on stage the
Classified ads column in the magazine There are Ads for
vibrators How to achieve sexual ecstacy and “Hippie chick
seeks similar for communal sex and vegetarian lifestyle 12
King St Whistable” John Lennon and Yoko in their famous
naked pose come to life and wave at us as the page turns onto
a page headlined Black Power” Michael X is giving a fervent
speech we turn again to see the incredible string band
surrounded by Martin’s graphics which move around like
shimmering snakes we turn the page again - What to do at an
orgy - there are lots of cartoon figures which are coupling
in every imaginable way we turn to the back cover and a
drawing of the Indian goddess Kali with 8 arms seems to be
dancing on the page

cuT TO

A view of the Oz office at work Felix at his desk - there
are dildos and artwork for the sexy small ads Louise puts
some tea down Richard is on the phone Jim is meditating on
top of his desk Widge is typing furiously Martin at the
layout board lights the biggest spliff known to humanity

CUT TO

A montage of famous images from the time the Tet offensive
in Vietnam Robert Kennedy’s assassination the Beatles with
the Mararishi Martin Luther King hippies in Haight Ashbury
protestors putting flowers in the barrels of guns in
Washington DC the riots in Paris — it feels like the whole
world is over run with hippies and their effects We see that
it is being formed on Martins layout board - it turns into a
fantastic collage of the whole hippie explosion

CUT TO

A one shot speeded up trip through London The Og gang are
all in a mini - they pass a joint around and zoom through the
streets They all get out and go into Granny takes a trip
then all bundle out and drive across London they get out at
the roundhouse go in a Pink Floyd gig - everyone is dancing
madly as the song ends with it’s cyclical fade of
“Everybody’s gonna be Alright”

EXT PICADILLY CIRCUS DAY

The midst of an anti-Vietnam demo The streets are packed
with young people with long hair they are not all as extreme
in their dress as the 0z troupe but we see the “hippie
revolution” has taken place They are carrying Oz placards”
saying “troops out”

Richard Louise Martin Felix and Jim are jostled around in
the midst of the noisy chaos Louise looks round in
amazement

LOUISE
Can you believe it All these
people —- just like us Richard

RICHARD
There must be twenty thousand of
them

MARTIN

OK - I take it back There were
people like us — obviously not
quite as cool or good looking But
we weren’t entirely on our own

Germaine is carrying a placard saying “Fuck the War” She is
pushed by the crowd against a policeman

POLICEMAN
You do realise that is a technical
obscenity

GERMAINE
OK I better change it then

She crosses out the words “The War” so the placard reads
Fuck

Felix is selling “Oz” He has a sign “Special demonstration
rate” The crowd are jostled forward against a huge line of
policemen who are lining the route It is clearly
exhilarating There is a sea of banners a cacophony of
whistles and chants The atmosphere is electric Widge sticks
a “Oz against the war” sticker on the jacket of a young
policeman

WIDGERY
Youre on the wrong side of the
Road brother

Widge smiles at the young policeman who must be almost
identically the same age But the policeman suddenly hits
Widgery in the face Widge reels back

POLICEMAN
Hippie filth

Widge is shocked Richard comes through the crowd to help
Widge whose nose is bleeding

WIDGERY
Did you see that

The crowd have surged forward and Richard and Widge are swept
along with it

RICHARD
Are you alright

Widge is bleeding
WIDGERY
Jesus Christ What’s the matter
with them

Suddenly a load of police push against the crowd and the 02
gang are pushed aggressively across the street

POLICEMAN
Get a bath

Another policeman knocks Felix’s magazines to the floor

FELIX
Hey

The line of police trample them under foot as they push
forward

LOUISE
Bastards

POLICEMAN
Shouldnt you be at home love

The police push forward sweeping everyone in their wake
EXT GROSVENOR SQUARE LONDON THE SAME

Richard Martin Widge Felix and Louise have all taken
refuge above the crowd on a statue in the middle of the
square Around them is a massive crowd Things are being

thrown Widge is covered in blood

WIDGERY
Fascist bastards

MARTIN
Come on Theres more than one way
to skin a cat

He leaps down

RICHARD
Where you going

MARTIN
Shopping

Missiles are thrown around the statue so Richard helps Louise
down Down in the crowd people are getting scared

RICHARD
Come on Let’s get out of here

They push their way against the tide of the crowd Richard
holding on to Louise They reach the police cordon

POLICEMAN
Where do you think youre going

RICHARD
We just want to get out

There is much pushing and shoving

POLICEMAN
You’re not going anywhere

A missile hits the policeman in the face There is much
shouting and chaos Suddenly The cordon breaks and the
demonstrators rush out into an open space Louise is carried
along by the force of the crowd Richard loses her She finds
herself in an open space reeling round disoriented Richard
spots her and runs towards her at great speed He throws
himself at her She gasps at the violence of his movement He
slams against her pushing her onto the ground A split
second later a police horse charges past exactly where Louise
had been standing

Richard and Louise look up to see a riot going on around
them It is terrifying Richard drags Louise to her feet
Suddenly Felix and Martin appear

FELIX
(screaming)
Get out of the way

Richard and Louise look down the street to see massed lines
of riot police running towards them down the street They
clutch each other in terror Martin and Felix run towards the
police line Germaine who is with them shouts

GERMAINE
No they‘11 kill you

But Felix and Martin throw open sacks of golf balls into the
path of the police who skid and fall onto the road like the
keystone cops Martin runs back towards Richard and Louise

MARTIN
Come on

They laugh at the comedy of the falling policemen then
suddenly Richard is knocked to the ground Policemen are
coming at them from behind Demonstrators are being viciously
beaten with truncheons Louise tries to help Richard up but
he leaps to his feet and grabs her

RICHARD
I‘m alright

They run to safety through some very real violence
INT OZ OFFICES LONDON NIGHT

Martin Widgery Germaine Felix Jim Richard and Louise and
several other hangers on are gathered around a black and
white TV watching the news People burning American flags
Demonstrators milling around with bleeding faces

RICHARD
I can’t believe it Under a labour
government They’re supposed to be
on our side

MARTIN
Forget it -— it’s the Democrats in
America who are bombing Vietnam
It’s not about Left and Right
anymore It‘s about Right and
Wrong

LOUISE
But I still don’t understand why
they hate us

WIDGERY
Because we’re getting through to
people

JIM
They didn’t have to hit us on the
head

Louise walks outside as the others bicker Martin sees her
leave and is about to follow just when he spots Richard grab
a drink and follow Louise outside

GERMAINE

You can’t expect to change things
without a fight Theyre not going
to suddenly give up power because
we go round with a daisy chain
Dont you see this is just the
start It was always going to cost
us Theres no such thing as a free
lunch - never mind “Free Love”

They stare glumly at the violence on the TV screen Martin
having missed his moment

EXT ROOF OF THE OZ OFFICES THE SAME

They sit and watch the city below them Louise lights up a
joint

RICHARD
Do you feel alright

LOUISE
A little bit shaky But you know -
it’s the most real thing that’s
happened since I left home

RICHARD
Werent you frightened

LOUISE
Not really I suppose the most
exhilarating thing was being with
so many people I know it was a
riot and everything but somehow
just being surrounded like that it
felt really safe

She passes Richard a joint

LOUISE (CONTD)

You know when I was little I had
this feeling that somehow deep
down I wasnt just me I was a
part of something bigger part of
something beyond me — but I didn’t
know what it was And I knew that
if I could just grasp it - Id be
happy Whole somehow

Richard tokes on the joint and coughs

LOUISE (CONTD)
You know - I think I might have
made that connection I mean that’s
whats important isn’t it Sharing

lives
RICHARD
What do you feel connected to
LOUISE
You Richard
RICHARD
Mel
LOUISE

Your vision I think what youve
done is really important Bringing
everyone together It was your
idea You realised everything was
connected You were right

(MORE )
4l

LOUISE (contd)
I think youre a very special
person Richard

RICHARD
I bet you say that to all the co-
editors of counter cultural organs

LOUISE
Only the ones I find devastatingly
attractive

RICHARD
I thought Martin was the one you
fancied

LOUISE
I have no doubt hed be a
spectacular lay But I’m really
looking for something different

RICHARD
Tf its a lousy lay youre after
I’m sure I won’t disappoint you
Joke I mean I think it’s a joke
Are you sure someone didn’t bang
you on the head this afternoon

LOUISE
Not conclusively
(pause)
You are allowed to kiss me

RICHARD
Are you absolutely sure

LOUISE
Well we are in the midst of a
sexual revolution

Richard goes to kiss her but realises the joint is in the
way he fumbles about not knowing what to do with it Louise
takes it takes a long drag and throws it away He kisses her
gently then with real passion Snow is falling all around
them We pull back over the rooftops of Notting Hill we see
the party below the snow falling We sweep over top floor
bedsits with Martin Sharp posters on the wall and psychedelic
music on the stereos Richard and Louise disappear into the
distance

INT RICHARDS BEDROOM NIGHT
Richard leads Louise into his bedroom by the hand
cuT TO
Richard and Louise on the bed face to face He gently takes

off her blouse It is a deeply erotic moment She tries to
take off his t shirt but it gets stuck over his head

They can’t get it off The more she pulls - the more he gets
stuck Louise can’t do anything for laughing Richard is
moaning Louise finally pulls it over his head even though
his arms are tangled up behind him They kiss in this
ridiculous position Their eyes closed — suddenly the farce
of the t shirt is forgotten and they are lost in each other
They finally part and look down On the pillow is a little
note from Martin it says for Richard and Louise -— there are
two tabs of acid which he has left for them Louise picks
them up

She puts a tab of acid on Richards tongue They kiss Their
lips seem to meld into each other and they literally melt -
blending into the paisley patterning on the quilt as they
make love The patterns swirl sensuously in front of us as
the Beatles Tomorrow never knows plays The patterns swirl
in a trippy way but when we come out of examining the
swirling patterns in all of their minutiae - we find Richard
and Louise are in bed post their love making but still
tripping Richard closes his eyes Louise holds up a record
He sniffs it

RICHARD
The Lovin’ Spoonful

He peeks from under the blindfold and sees he is right

LOUISE
How do you do that

RICHARD
I don’t know It’s amazing I can
actually smell it
She proffers another LP It is Richard sniffs

RICHARD (CONTD)
Is it the Rolling Stones

LOUISE
Maybe

RICHARD
Satanic Majesties

LOUISE
No

RICHARD
Aftermath

LOUISE
No

RICHARD

Let It Bleed

LOUISE
Yes

RICHARD
Its amazing - everything connects
with everything else — everything
is everything else - it’s like from
the history of time to the end of
everything everything is
everything for ever Do you see

Louise is smiling at Richard

LOUISE
Completely

She takes “Let it Bleed” from Richard and flings it across
the room

LOUISE
I love you Richard Neville

She kisses him

RICHARD
This is what it’s really like isn’t
it Being free

He kisses her and they slowly glide out of the frame
INT RICHARD’S BASEMENT MORNING

Richard wakes up He smiles to himself as Louise nestles more
closely

RICHARD
(quotes Wordsworth to
himself)
Bliss it was in the dawn to be
alive But to be young was very
heaven

Then theres a sneeze and a hairy head appears at the foot of
the bed It is Jim

JIM
Hey man

Richard is aghast

RICHARD
Have you been there all night

JIM
Its alright you didn’t really
disturb me till you started
throwing records around

Suddenly there is a huge banging at the door Richard jumps
up alarmed

RICHARD
Jesus Christ Who the hell is that

The banging is insistent

JIM
Aren’t you going to get it

Richard leaps out of bed naked and runs through the “office”
covered in the debris of last nights party He opens the door
to A middle aged man in a raincoat and a comb-over whom we
recognise as Detective Luff

LUFF
Neville Mr Richard Neville

Richard stares blearily at him

LUFF (CONTD)
Detective Inspector Luff

RICHARD
Inspector Love

LUFF
Don’t take the piss Luff L UF F —
of the Vice Squad matey Now out
of the bloody way

He pushes past Richard as do the other coppers Luff looks
around

RICHARD
Hang on You can’t just come in
here

LUFF

You don’t think I‘d come without a
warrant Youre not dealing with
some plod from Westbourne Grove
You’re not the only one with a
degree from university

Luff has difficulty getting the warrant out of his pocket He
finally flashes a piece of paper at him and goes over to a
pile of Oz magazines He picks one up and looks inside He
tuts

LUFF (CONTD)
So did you always want to be a
pornographer or is it something you
just fell into

RICHARD
Were a non-aligned counter-—
cultural magazine There’s nothing
pornographic about Oz

LUFF
(he reads from the paper
in his hand)
Hot Hippie chick likes to suck
macrobiotic cock”

RICHARD
That’s a classified ad

LUFF
You should be bloody classified
sunshine Look at this place I
don’t even like to think what you
get up to in here

RICHARD
I don’t get up to anything I never
have the time

Luff heads for the bedroom door

RICHARD
Hey that’s my bedroom

Luff opens the door to reveal Jim and Louise cowering in bed
Luff is disgusted and shuts it again

LUFF
Personally I dont give a monkeys
croup what you do in the privacy of
your own home But unfortunately in
the last six issues of your
magazine you’ve had 55 adverts for
sundry items of sexual equipment
43 articles advocating 23 separate
sexual perversions And an article
about hemophilia

RICHARD
But that’s a blood disease

LUFF
Don’t get smart with me arsehole
Your organ is a cesspit of vice and
corruption Look at this

He picks up a dildo and examines it with disdain as Louise
and Jim come into the office

RICHARD
It’s just an advertising sample

LOUISE
But you’d be surprised where it’s
been

tuff puts it down quickly

RICHARD
We use it to stir the tea

LUFF
Look don’t play silly buggers You
might think it’s funny but I’m
damn sure I don’t want my sixteen
year old daughter exposed to filth
like this Look I‘m not some
fundamentalist nutter - Im as
broad-minded as the next guy but
this You think this is freedom
This is low-grade pornography ™

JIM
The real pornography is watching
your generation drop napalm on
Vietnam

LUFF
I’m not fucking talking to you

Suddenly Luff grabs Richard and its serious

LUFF
Listen I’m not out to persecute
you Just clean up this shithouse
of a magazine or I‘1l clean out the
fucking lot of you Capeeche
Comrade

He walks out Richard looks at a copper who is looking rather
enthusiastically at a magazine He puts it down embarrassed
Richard watches Luff go But a voice behind him makes Luff
stop

JIM
Youre going to regret you came
here

Luff comes back He stares him in the face

JIM (CONTD)
Weve all got terrible colds

Luff doesn’t know what to do - he turns round and leaves
Louise comes up to Richard who is suitably shocked and
holds him

LOUISE
Bastard

INT OFFICE LATER

Everybody is gathered Jim closes the curtains fusses about
in a paranoid state as if they were being bugged Felix is
unconcerned

FELIX
Well I think it’s fucking excellent
news We’re legitimate outlaws
Just think what this is going to do
in terms of the circulation

RICHARD
Therell be no circulation if they
close us down Look were going to
have to be extremely careful what
we publish

WIDGERY
I agree If we spent more time
writing about serious issues and
less space exploiting the female
form wed be in a damn better
position to protect ourselves Look
do we really need so many
advertisements for dildos

GERMAINE
I agree the problem with Oz is
weve got too lowbrow

FELIX
Lowbrow Nobody can fucking
understand it Who the fuck’s
interested in the existentialist
position on gay rights

JIM
I am

FELIX
What the fuck for

JIM
Well I’m gay actually

Everybody stops

RICHARD
Really

JIM
Well I havent actually had sex or
anything But I fully intend to

FELIX
Anyway - I don’t know why
everybody’s acting like I’m the
debaser of high ideals here - each
dildo ad means we pay for a 3
colour separation double page
spread How the hell are we going
to keep expanding without looking
after the advertising revenue

RICHARD
Look all Widge is saying is we
didnt start up 0z to sell plastic
vibrators and LPs for the
Incredible String Band

LOUISE
For godsake Stop arguing It’s
pathetic We‘ve just been raided by
the police and what are we actually
doing about it

HIPPIE CHEMIST

HIPPIE CHEMIST 2
It will save mankind man Simple
evolution We can re-program the
uptight Western mind

MARTIN
What does it do

HIPPIE CHEMIST 2
Well It kinda totally atomises
your ego putting you completely at
one with the molecular universe

HIPPIE CHEMIST
It is exceedingly heavy

MARTIN
I heard it can make you go blind

HIPPIE CHEMIST 2
You say that like it’s a bad thing

Martin looks at a bag full of tiny tabs

MARTIN
How many trips have you got there

HIPPIE CHEMIST 2
Six or seven thousand

HIPPIE CHEMIST
Enough to save a lot of people

HIPPIE CHEMIST (CONTD)
Would you care to ingest a sample

Martin Martin

RICHARD
Look dont worry He’s bound to
have something brilliant up his
sleeve

INT MARTINS HOUSE THE SAME

Richard and Louise creep inside They can hear an Indian raga
playing They emerge into the room which is completely empty
painted white with a huge acetate of a Question mark on the
wall There is no furniture but thousands and thousands of
pieces of cut out images all over the floor Martin sits in
the middle - seemingly in a trace

RICHARD
What happened to your furniture

MARTIN
There wasn’t really any room

LOUISE
What are you doing Martin

MARTIN
I never really know till Im
finished

RICHARD
You’re supposed to be doing the
cover

MARTIN
Hey You can’t rush the creative
process Richard

RICHARD
Martin Weve a deadline at the
printers in forty eight hours
Look this isn’t easy we were
raided by the police this morning

MARTIN -
What are you saying to me

RICHARD
You agreed to do the cover I need
you to do it Martin I’m trying to
run a magazine here

MARTIN
Deadlines Who wants lines of dead
things What are you doing I
thought you wanted to do things
differently I thought the whole
point was to do it our way
Richard

RICHARD
Ive had it It’s not fair Why the
hell do I have to run round chasing
fucking copy while everybody else
is allowed to get off their tits
I’m sick of it Martin The problem
isnt freedom of expression it’s
the industrial level chemical
abuse Youve got 24 hours to get
it finished or I’1l have to use
something else — understood

He storms out

MARTIN
Did I say something wrong

Martin looks at Louise

LOUISE
I think the pressure is getting to
him He’s only trying to do his
best

MARTIN

So are you fucking him
LOUISE

Yes
MARTIN

I see

Hes a very lucky man
A bit square but lucky

LOUISE
Hes a good man So are you
Please — do something special
Martin For me

Martin looks at her
INT OZ OFFICES LONDON NIGHT

Richard is in the office typing away — burning the midnight
oil Louise appears wearing just one of Richards long
grandad shirts - she kisses him on the neck

LOUISE
Another wild night at the heart of
the counter-culture

RICHARD
I‘m sorry sweetheart I just have
to re-write Jims article about
Magic Mushrooms and 1‘11 be in

LOUISE
Won’t he notice

RICHARD
I doubt hell remember he wrote it
in the first place Do you think he
really is gay

LOUISE
For the sake of my gender - I
certainly hope so

She kisses him on the back of the neck

LOUISE
OK But don’t take too long The
revolution”’11 be waiting in the
bedroom

Richard reluctantly continues to type Louise lingers for a
moment then retreats to the bedroom Richard makes a typing
error

RICHARD
Bollocks

He tears the paper from the typewriter screws it up and
starts again

CUT TO

The desk is covered with balls of screwed up paper Richard
is completely knackered He pulls out a completed sheet He
looks up - it is four in the morning He quietly leaves the
desk and walks through to the adjacent room Louise is fast

asleep He looks longingly at her climbs into bed and turns

off the light
BASEMENT MORNING
A petal falls gracefully through the air

Louise is still in bed - Richard has covered Louises
sleeping body with petals Louise wakes up to see petals
falling down onto her face

LOUISE
Richard

RICHARD
It takes a great deal of
experimentation to maintain a
steady velocity

He lights a spliff

RICHARD (CONTD)
You’re right Fuck it Bugger the
magazine Im going to lock the
door and screw you absolutely
senseless till midnight

Richard drops his robe - he looks down suggesting he has
something to be proud of Louise is obviously impressed by
what she sees

LOUISE
Goodness

Suddenly Jim pops his head round the door
JIM
Rich —- weve got a bit of a
problem

Richard spins round covering himself with his hands

JIM
There’s someone asking for you

RICHARD
Look - I told you not to disturb
me Just tell them to fuck off out
of it I don’t care who they are

Richard turns round to see his Mother and Father standing in
the doorway

MRS NEVILLE

Richard covers himself up They look through to see Louise

to meet you

Richard’s horrified face

CUT TO
Richard his Mum and Dad in the office with Felix and Jim

RICHARD
What on earth are you doing here

MRS NEVILLE
Weve come over for a week to see
Jill Your Dad sent a letter a
month ago - if you actually rang us
more often we wouldnt need to just
“pop by” would we

FELIX
Shit Richard It must’ve been one
of the letters Jim and I ate when
we took that really great acid

Dad looks around the room and picks up the dildo and looks at
it with puzzlement and puts it down

RICHARD
Jesus Christ

Richard looks at Louise in horror
EXT THE OZ GARDEN DAY

Richard Louise Felix Germaine Jim and Widge are all
having a very polite tea party

MRS NEVILLE
So what exactly is this magazine
you are doing

WIDGERY
Well essentially it’s a counter
cultural organ bringing together
all sorts of strands from satirical
existentialists to the
revolutionary gays

MRS NEVILLE
Does anybody actually buy it

FELIX
Mostly get it for the adverts We
should be the Daily Mail of the
Underground But we’‘re like a
bloody philosophy text book

LOUISE
Felix is the resident philistine

FELIX
Tf it was up to me I‘d sack all the
editors and just let anybody have a
go

MRS NEVILLE
Who edits it at the moment

GERMAINE

Officially it’s a collective but
really Richard is in charge

MRS NEVILLE
No wonder it’s incomprehensible

COL NEVILLE
(looking at Jim)
Do you think he’s alright

GERMAINE
It’s OK He’s just tripping

MRS NEVILLE
Where exactly has be been

RICHARD
Anyway Mum weren’t you going to
do some sightseeing

show Perhaps Louise and you would
care to join us

RICHARD
Unfortunately Oz is sponsoring an
event tonight at the Roundhouse

JIM
Yeah the Living Theatre man

COL NEVILLE
Oh You quite like the theatre

Richard

Richard looks at Louise in horror
EXT OUTSIDE THE ROUNDHOUSE LONDON DAY

Richard and Louise are stood in a queve of hundreds of the
most far out hippies and freaks in London Mum and Dad
dressed in their conservative clothes couldnt be more out of
place

LOUISE
Maybe they’1l quite like it

RICHARD
Nobody likes the Living Theatre
The whole point is you’re supposed
to hate it

Col Neville looks at a poster for the show “Paradise Now”
It shows a load of naked hippies writhing in a pile of
contorted flesh

COL NEVILLE
We saw a very good Pirates of
Penzance in Adelaide recently

RICHARD
Are you sure you wouldn’t prefer to
just go for a drink

MRS NEVILLE
Nonsense - it’s not every day
you’re in London

(MORE)

MRS NEVILLE (contd)
I’m going to have a bit of culture

LOUISE
You already did

The lights start to dim

MRS NEVILLE
Oh it’s starting

Richard take centre stage The audience hoot applause

RICHARD
It is my great honour to introduce
to you one of the great artists of
the counter-counter culture

As Richard speaks the troupe stand behind him and form the
word “Anarchy” with their bodies

RICHARD

revolutionary performances and
mind expanding activities

(MORE)

RICHARD (contd)
Ladies Gentlemen freaks and my
parents I am proud to present to
you from New York City Mr Julian
Beck and the Living Theatre

Cheers and applause Richard take his seat next to his
parents

MRS NEVILLE
Well done Richard

They watch attentively as twenty near naked scrawny hippies
take the stage and form a circle They start to do some
ritual group movement with screaming Mrs Neville puts her
glasses on to get a better look The actors start to take off
what few clothes they are wearing

ACTORS
We are one - we are all one

They start to pair off and start to writhe around each other
sexually

COL NEVILLE
Bloody hell

Mrs Neville is transfixed The actors are now on the ground
in a writhing pile of human flesh - they are making
exaggerated grunting noises which builds into a crescendo of
a collective orgasm Richard is holding his head

The actors stand up in a circle facing the audience
completely naked and they start a chant

ACTORS
We order you to smoke dope
We order you to change your mind
We order you to disobey all order
We order you to make love with your
neighbour

Richard realises he is sitting next to his father
RICHARD
(to Louise)
Ill be taking your side

The actors wail and start approaching members of the
audience

RICHARD
Oh no

Richard wants to die

The actors scream at people in the front row then a naked
Julian Beck decides to pick on Col Neville

ACTOR
Come on you bourgeois fucking pig
Take off your clothes and fuck me
up the ass

RICHARD
This is not happening

Richard wants the world to open up and swallow him whole

ACTOR
Lose your inhibitions Open your
fucking mind

It is quite clear that Dad will not take off his clothes but
sits firmly rather embarrassed The actor is used to not
getting a reaction and others join him They start to taunt
Col Neville The actors chant “Pig” Whilst the main actor
berates Richards father

ACTOR
Come on you asshole What the fuck
are you frightened off Capitalist
Pig

The Colonel gets up and land him a sharp right hook Beck is
out cold

EXT STREET NIGHT
Louise Richard and Mrs and Mrs Neville walking back

Raving looney

RICHARD
You weren’t supposed to hit the
actors Dad It was part of the
act

LOUISE
Don‘t you think it’s amazing to be
that committed to what you’re
doing

RICHARD
Are you talking about Dad or the
Living Theatre

MRS NEVILLE
Well I rather liked it I thought
the bit when they all spat on the
man in the front row was a bit
uncalled for but all in all -
quite enjoyable

They have reached Richards basement They see Martin outside
with a portfolio

MARTIN
Something’s going on in there -
they wont let me in

Richard Louise et al come down the stairs There is loud
rock and roll coming from inside Richard takes out his key
and opens the door

MARTIN

MARTIN
What is going on Richard This is
completely exploitative

FELIX
Whats exploitative about it
They’re not real revolutionaries
(MORE )

FELIX (contd)
Shes from a model agency and the
baby belongs to the art editor of
Vogue

MARTIN
What about my artwork

FELIX
Its alright Richard thought if it
actually came in on time we could
stick it inside

LOUISE
You knew about this

RICHARD
Well -

MARTIN

I thought we were supposed to be
changing peoples minds not feeding
them the same old shit in new
boxes

FELIX
Its alright for you You just get
stoned and make collages You don’t
have to talk to the advertisers
You don’t have to worry about the
circulation

RICHARD
I think everybody should calm down

FELIX
I dont know why everybody’s so
bothered about who does what
anyway Its so bourgeois We
shouldn’t be hogging it for
ourselves - it should be
democratic Anybody could edit
this thing -— it’s not rocket
science

MARTIN
How can you possibly be thinking of
doing this Richard

BLACK GIRL
Hurry up I’m freezing my black ass
off here

RICHARD
I haven’t decided on anything

MARTIN
You fucking sell out

COL NEVILLE
Perhaps we should head back to the
hotel

The baby starts crying

RICHARD
No no It’s alright

MARTIN
Babies with kalashnikovs I thought
we were about Love and Peace

FELIX
Flower power’s dead man That was
yesterdays trip Keep up with the

BLACK GIRL

But I’ve got no clothes on

LOUISE
Get out of here or I‘1l stick this
tripod up your revolutionary arse

She picks it up so the three feet point at Felix

LOUISE
This way round

Louise chases everyone out then slams the door
EXT STREET NOTTING HILL THE SAME
Richard grabs Martin

RICHARD
Please Martin

MARTIN
I thought this was about thinking
outside the box I thought this was
about me and you Felix Dennis

It starts to rain Martin storms off Richard is left
reeling We hear police sirens in the background His dad
come up to him

COL NEVILLE
I know we havent always seen eye
to eye But I‘1l pay for you and
Louise to fly back Well get you a
lovely apartment down on the beach
This isn’t you Richard

RICHARD
You don’t understand Dad These
are the best days of my life

COL NEVILLE
Im doing my best to understand
Your Mother and I have worked all
our lives to give you a chance
Richard I’m all for doing your own
thing but all this screaming and
shouting doesn’t seem like Love and
Peace to me It just all seems a
bitsqualid Is this really what
you want Richard Is this really
where you want to be

For a moment in the pouring rain Richard hesitates He
looks at his worried parents Someone is sick in the gutter
across the street A police car zooms past - siren blazing

RICHARD
(sadly)
I know it must seem strange to you
(MORE )

RICHARD (contd)
But yes This is exactly where Ive
got to be I’m sorry Dad

His father looks Richard in the eye he reaches into his
pocket and pulls out a wad of notes which he stuffs into
Richards hand

CoOL NEVILLE
Please take care of yourself

RICHARD
Im sorry Dad

He hugs his father

COL NEVILLE
I suppose it’s not so bad They had
me killing Japs at your age

For a moment we feel real compassion for Col Neville who is
obviously haunted by the war His father hugs Richard but
this time with real passion then walks over the Road to join
his wife they walk off leaving Richard standing alone in the
rain

INT OZ THE SAME

Richard comes in drenched he stares at Louise who is
furiously tidying up the mess

LOUISE
Don’t say anything

RICHARD
But Louise —

LOUISE
I dont mind making the tea for
everybody I don’t mind doing the
proofreading I don’t mind getting
my tits out for the betterment of
art and society - but I absolutely
take issue with surrendering
editorial control to Felix fucking
Dennis

RICHARD
Youre getting this all out of
proportion

LOUISE
I thought you were the one with
imagination I thought you were the
one with the vision and spirit And
now you want to hand it all over to
Elmer Fudd You can’t let people
walk all over you I thought this
was something you believed in
RICHARD
I do believe in it I’m the one
that makes it happen While
everybody else gets to take drugs
and fuck around I’m the one
worrying about advertisers and
tippexing people’s typos

LOUISE
So now you want to sleep around

RICHARD
No I never said that

LOUISE
Yes you did

RICHARD
No — I didn’t mean that

LOUISE
Weve only just got together and
now you’re wanting to run around
like a dog on heat

RICHARD
Technically you’d be the one on
heat

She throws his things into the office

RICHARD
Louise calm down we’ll go to the
Isle of Wight Festival - chill out -
it’1ll be alright We just need some
space to reconnect

She throws a duvet at Richard

LOUISE
And you can go to the fucking Isle
of Wight on your own and get
yourself some lobotomized groupies
to blow you to your hearts content

She slams the door

RICHARD

But I don’t want to get blown by
groupies I don’t want to get blown
by anybody

(pause)
Well - except you
Louise Louise
Damn this stupid magazine

64

She does not answer Richard sits in the middle of the floor -
head in hands Then he notices a flier - for the Isle of
Wight festival There is a naked girl dancing She winks at
Richard just like Louise’s poster did in the earlier

sequence

CUT TO
EXT STAGE - ISLE OF WIGHT - NIGHT - SPECIAL EFFECTS SHOT

Handheld POV Youre looking at a pair of hands as they do up
a lime green shirt They are your hands A dressing room —
candles incense - someone gives you a joint - you are
talking to your backing band as if in a dream A sexy girl
kisses you and you head out to the stage You walk on stage -
the crowd go wild -— you plug into a Marshall Amp The crowd
are going wild - but it’s muffled - a sort of haze You start
to play some shit hot guitar - you are playing a blazing
version of Voodoo Chile - you check out the other members of
the band playing with you You are a god - you are a rock god
at the height of your powers Girls scream A young topless
girl throws herself at you and has to be pulled off by hells
angel security guys We pull back to see you are Richard
Neville dressed in Hendrix paraphernalia This is a dream He
starts playing the guitar with his teeth

INT TRAIN TO ISLE OF WIGHT DAY

Richard wakes up with a jolt He is on a train opposite
Germaine who is sat next to a particularly conservative man
with a Red Faced

GERMAINE
Sometimes I can’t quite believe the
most conservative man in Britain is
editing its most radical magazine
Your trouble is you need to shag a
few more people No wonder you’re
always so uptight

The red faced man is trying not to listen

RICHARD
Listen I dont want to “shag a few
more people” I’m perfectly happy
with Louise

GERMAINE
See youre so fucking repressed -
look - the only way forward is to
abandon all previous forms of
social relations and shag like a
donkey It’s not natural to tie
yourself down to one person

(MORE)

GERMAINE (contd)
Youre in the middle of the biggest
revolution in sexual relations
since we were fucking monkeys and
all you want to do is bang the girl
next door

RICHARD
Look Louise is more than just a
casual fuck

GERMAINE
Exactly - you pay lip service to
being liberated but think like an
Melbourne Accountant Look you’re
the one who wants to change things
Well start with your nob end Open
yourself up to what’s going on In
my opinion group sex is the highest
expression of our new culture

RICHARD
If you want to get shagged bandy by
the massed members of the MC5
that’s your problem All I want is
a quiet day off from Oz

GERMAINE

You always were a reactionary
arsehole You want women to treat
women like chattels — not the
living breathing fucking sexual
volcanoes they really are The
truth is youre terrified of your
own sexuality

Germaine gets up and flounces off to the loo just as a guy
comes along with a trolley

RICHARD
A cup of tea please

WAITER
Look sod off son If you want any
tea of mine - come back with a
haircut

Richard smiles sheepishly at the red faced man opposite
RED FACED MAN
Listen I heard the whole thing and
I find it absolutely disgusting
Richard prepares for a conservative onslaught
RED FACED MAN

-How dare they refuse you service
on the basis of your hairstyle

EXT FERRY TO ISLE OF WIGHT DAY

Richard and Germaine are on deck having a fag looking out
at the Solent The whole boat is crawling with hippies

RICHARD
I suppose this really is it We
really have changed things The
Underground’s gone mainstream

CERMAINE
Thats the whole point isn’t it We
don’t just want to keep it for
ourselves Enjoy it while you can
Richard you don’t know it‘1l last
forever

EXT ENTRANCE TO BACKSTAGE THE ISLE OF WIGHT FESTIVAL

EXTINT BACKSTAGE ISLE OF WIGHT FESTIVAL DAY

Hendrix is playing on stage as Richard wanders through the
backstage area open mouthed He is clearly on the pull
constantly distracted by groupies on every side he is
virtually drooling when he suddenly sees Martin across the
crowd He pushes his way through the throng of people and
finally reaches Martin who is watching the music on the
stage

MARTIN
Surprise surprise Come to sell
the revolution by the pound

RICHARD
Martin look Im so sorry about
Felix and

MARTIN
Forget it I don’t know why I was
expecting anything else Same as
every revolution — starts with a
vision ends as an advert

RICHARD
So what are you doing here

MARTIN
I only came to see Tiny Tim then
Im going home The whole thing’s
horseshit Richard

RICHARD
You can’t go home Look - this is
what we’ve been striving to
achieve Look at all those people

MARTIN
I thought we wanted people to
express their individuality
Theyre all the fucking same
Richard Long haired cattle

RICHARD
But these are ordinary people
Martin They are the revolution

MARTIN
They’re Alfs Richard - it’s like a
Perry Como gig with lower standards
of personal hygiene

(MORE )

MARTIN (contd)
The highest act of revolutionary
consciousness that’s ever crossed
their minds is serving in an
oriental boutique

RICHARD
But I thought this is what we
wanted I thought we were trying to
change the culture

MARTIN
Maybe you were Richard I was
trying to change people’s minds
This isn’t a revolution Richard
Its like a hippie version of
Woolworths

RICHARD
Come with me Help me make the
speech Say it like it is - if you
have to

MARTIN
I told you - I’ve quit No one
wants to hear what I’ve got to say

RICHARD
No You are Oz as much as anyone
Come on do it with me Say what you
want to say

EXT SIDE OF THE STAGE DAY

Richard and Martin watch from the side of the stage as
Hendrix finishes his set A couple of groupies pass Richard a
joint Hendrix is truly amazing Finally he finishes and the
crowd go wild He comes off stage He grasps Richard‘s hand
as he passes Wild applause from the crowd

HENDRIX
Follow that honky

The organiser comes over to Richard and Martin

ORGANISER
You’re on

Richard follows Martin as the announcer speaks

ANNOUNCER
And here to speak to you from every
hippie’s favorite magazine its
Richard and Martin from Oz

Richard and Martin walk out to huge cheers They survey the
vast crowd

MARTIN
Hello Actually I didn’t really
expect to be talking to you tonight
on behalf of Oz - so I don’t
actually have anything prepared
But before I pass you over to
Richard Neville — the editor of Oz
Magazine — Id like to read
something to you I found just the
other day As it sums up what I
feel about this occasion

Martin takes a bit of paper from his pocket and reads

MARTIN
No one can doubt the fact that
during the last year a revolution
of the most momentous character has
been swelling among the youth of
the west

Shouts of approval Martin carries on - he reads from a piece
of paper

MARTIN
Look at the strength and awareness
of the young people today We are
approaching a life in common a
life of revolution A life to work
for the revolutionary advancement
of peace and spiritual prosperity
Our job is to wake everyone up

Cheers

MARTIN
Do away with illusions So when
people wake up they will never fall
asleep again

Huge response

MARTIN
And history will Judge the movement
not according to the number of pigs
we have removed but according to
wether the revolution has succeeded
in returning the power to the
people to enforce the will of the
people everywhere Power to the
People

The roar of the crowd Chants of “Oz Oz Oz”

MARTIN
Cheers But thanks are not due to
me but to the guy who wrote that
(MORE )

MARTIN (contd)
(looks at his sheet of
paper)
Mr Adolf Hitler Address to the
Reichstag 1937

There is silence A shocked reaction No one knows what this
means let alone what to do He walks off Richard is left
looking at the crowd He turns and runs after Martin as
bottles start to fly

EXT BACKSTAGE THE SAME
Richard spins Martin around

RICHARD
What the fuck are you doing

MARTIN

own now There is only one true
revolutionary in this entire
festival and that’s Tiny fucking
Tim

Martin storms off past the Hell’s Angels

RICHARD
Tiny Tim

EXT ISLE OF WIGHT STAGE DAY

Tiny Tim has now taken the stage — he is extraordinary
looking (think Tim Burton with a ukulele) He starts singing
Tip Toe Thru’ the Tulips sung in a high pitched falsetto
Richard looks on amazed at this bizarre performer - like
Martin truly original truly eccentric

EXT BACKSTAGE THE SAME

Germaine walks by with two other girls and joins Richard as

GERMATNE
This is Richard —- he’s the editor

endowed

RICHARD

trees and emerges at a little lake It is deserted He looks
across the beautiful lake At the other side he sees a young
woman directly facing him He strips off his shirt his
trousers We see the woman on the other bank is doing the

LOUISE
I thought youd be in the Isle of
Wight

MARTIN
I came home It wasn’t what I
wanted

They tread water languidly

LOUISE
What do you want

MARTIN
Something like this But forever

LOUISE
Youd get bored

MARTIN
Maybe Maybe not

LOUISE
Oh I think so We’re only human

MARTIN
So what do you want

LOUISE
Just what I thought I had Same old
horseshit Make a difference Be
properly loved

Martin does not reply

Perhaps I could just lie here

They both lie like starfish in the water

Louise gets up too

LOUISE
If you think you are going to leave
me here answering the phone while
you go shagging your way around the
Home Counties you’ve got another
thing coming

RICHARD
It was a mistake It was research

MARTIN
What are you doing This whole
scene is really fucked up For a
Moment there I really thought I was
wrong That we could love each
other without all that old
fashioned shit about ownership
Does one lot of love take away
another lot No you can be loved
by one person and another and
another and another There is no
end to it Listen to you both

RICHARD
Please Louise I take back

RICHARD
But you can’t leave me

LOUISE

RICHARD
Because I love you

This makes Louise stop and turn She is standing by a queue
of people waiting to get on a bus We think she is going to
melt

LOUISE
Richard Love isn’t about gazing at
each other through a psychedelic
haze Love is about commitments
Love is making choices

A bus arrives

CONDUCTOR
You getting on love

LOUISE
For your information He fucked me
Richard and he is fantastic and it
was beautiful And it made me cry

CHARLES (KID 1)
So you’re saying were the
editors

VIVIAN (KID 2)
And we can put in exactly what we
like

FELIX
Be as wild as you want Slag off

KATIE
We were thinking about this for the
cover

FELIX

Fucking hell

Charles passes a joint to Felix as Vivian explains his
position

VIVIAN
You said we could do what we want
We think its transgressive nature
is an important riposte to the
simultaneous prudery and
hypocritical commodification of
womens bodies in the popular

media

FELIX
Are you sure That’s a very big
dildo

EXT PORCH OF A SQUALID VILLA DAY

LOUISE

another to be free and responsible
I changed my whole line on it at

going to have a transcendental
sexual experience it turned out
like a dirty weekend with the
Monkees It’s one thing being free
Its another ending up with a twat
like a horse collar for their

confiscated porno film The Oz magazine gets slapped down and
is picked up by another policeman and heads down another

He throws down the magazine Richard looks turns it like
everybody else

LUFF

What have they been doing

LUFF

As co-editor and proprietor of Oz
you are charged along with Mr James
Anderson and Mr Felix Dennis with
48 counts of obscenity 2 counts of
corrupting the public morals And
four counts of publishing
pornographic material Should add
up to a possible custodial sentence
of between five and fifteen years

Richard looks sick

RICHARD
But I didn’t have anything to do
with it I’ve been in Ibiza

LUFF
It‘s your magazine pal
Alternatively - if you got your
things and fucked off back to where
you came from I might turn a blind
eye to the matter of you leaving
the country

RICHARD
The magazine would still go on
without me

LUFF
Do me a favour they couldn’t run a
Christmas Club I don’t see why the
British Tax payer should spend
decent money banging up the likes
of you I’m giving you twenty four
hours If youre not out of the
country I’m gonna nail your
bollocks to the front of the Old
Bailey understood

RICHARD
Where is everything

Jim and Felix come in

RICHARD
What the hell were you thinking I
go away for less than a week and
everything weve worked for the
last two years is completely
ruined Over Rupert Bear for
christsakes

JIM
At least we put the bit with the
dildo on the back cover

FELIX
We thought it was a sort of
interesting aesthetic experiment

RICHARD
There isn’t anything aesthetic
about it You’re just obsessed with
filth I didn’t come to London to
spend fifteen years in gaol for
something I havent even set eyes
on I’m not even from here Look —
youre on your own Felix

FELIX
What do you mean on our own

RICHARD
I’m going back to Australia

FELIX
But you can’t do that We’re bound
over to appear on trial You can’t
go anywhere

RICHARD
It’s not my fault it all went
wrong

Felix looks at Richard suddenly the penny drops
FELIX
They’ve done you a deal You
bastard I can’t believe it You’ve
done a bloody deal
Richard looks At Felix embarrassed

FELIX
You fucking traitor

He goes into the room and grabs the few things of his which
are left

FELIX
Think of your reputation

RICHARD
Ill worry about that on Bondi
Beach

FELIX
Please Richard please You cant
leave me to defend myself with him

RICHARD
What scares me Felix is maybe
Martins right - you are the one
who’s the genius of the times The
real art is knowing how to flog
something regardless of whats
inside the box I came here to
change things to make something
beautiful I didn’t just come here
to sell dildos and offend people
Dont worry Youll be alright
Felix youll always bounce back

Richard picks up his stuff and marches out

Youve got me all wrong

Richard passes Jim who is lighting a gargantuan spliff
JIM

See you then

EXT STREET NOTTING HILL THE SAME

he stops dead

RICHARD
Oh shit

He looks straight ahead of him It’s Louise

LOUISE
Where are you going now

He doesn’t answer

RICHARD
0 bollocks

She doesn’t react

LOUISE
You selfish cowardly arrogant
prick

Richard turns round amazed

LOUISE
You pig-headed arse Where do you
think you’re going now

RICHARD
I‘m sorry Louise

LOUISE
And so you think it’s alright just
to walk out and leave This isn’t
about us Richard This isn’t about
Jim or Felix This is not about me
and you This is about a kid in
Dumfries reading Oz under his
sheets cos no one understands him
this is about kids getting napalmed
in Vietnam This is about a whole
fucking generation’s right to tell
the truth in the way people will
understand it You wanted to do
something important Richard Well
this is your big chance

(MORE )

LOUISE (contd)
They don’t want to close us down
because we‘re a failure - they want
to close us down because were
winning You don‘t choose these
moments Richard it‘s like when
you fall in love - they choose you
With dreams come responsibilities
You cant leave the entire future
of free speech in Britain to Jim
and Felix can you

Richard looks at him He knows she’s right

RICHARD
So you want me to risk spending the
rest of my youth in gaol by taking
on the entire British legal
establishment on an entirely
hopeless cause — with only a bunch
of stoned hippies to support me

LOUISE
Yes

RICHARD
And I suppose youre not even going
to take me back are you

LOUISE
Not necessarily

Richard knows he has no choice but to stay

INT SALISBURY ARMS INNS OF FIELD THE SAME

Richard Felix and Jim sit anxiously in the pub looking at
widge

WIDGERY
So I remembered I once shared a
room with a guy whose brother was
working at the Inns of Court - who
put me on to a really reactionary
barrister who put me on to Geoffrey
who has agreed to act for Felix

They look up at Geoffrey - he looks about sixteen

GEOFFERY
Hello

PELIX
He looks about sixteen

WIDGERY
Actually Geoffery’s just got a
triple starred first for his PhD in
Oxford on Freedom of Speech and the
British legal system Apparently
he’s the shittest hot legal brain
in a generation

GEOFFERY
I prefer to think of myself as the
hottest shit

He puts down his briefcase and a pile of books

LOUISE
I called Jill who‘s talked to John
Mortimer who’s going to represent
Jim

FELIX
Not the John Mortimer The
playwright barrister famous
champagne socialist John Mortimer

John Mortimer rushes up to them
JOHN MORTIMER
The very same darlings sorry I’m

late

RICHARD
Hang on We can’t afford you

JOHN MORTIMER
Don’t worry - I’ve decided to waive
my fees darlings

He pours some champagne into a half—pint mug And stuffs a
mouthful of chips into his mouth while jabbering

JOHN MORTIMER
Anyway I had a little word with
the Stones whove given us money to
create a little defense committee -
and the news from Apple Records is
John and Yoko are writing you a
“Beatles save Oz” single

He stuffs more chips into his mouth

JOHN MORTIMER
IT havent had so much fun in years
Got to go Just wanted to wish you
well

He decides to finish the remaining chips
See you in court darlings

RICHARD
Hang on what about me

GEOFFERY
Thing is - it’s all very well
having the best defense team in
London

JOHN MORTIMER
But you don’t want to just appear
like charlatans hiding behind
expensive counsel

LOUISE
So we thought that you should -
defend yourself

RICHARD
Myself But I don’t know anything
about the law

GEOFFERY
Thats alright you are allowed a
Mackensie lawyer a non—
professional friend who can look
things up for you

LOUISE
Which Widge has agreed to do

WIDGERY
Don’t worry we’ll really stick it
to them this time

RICHARD
How come you two get the best
counsel in Britain and I get a
Trotskyist medical student

JOHN MORTIMER
Oh don’t worry Trust me The whole
thing’1l be a riot

INT FLAT NIGHT

Richard and Louise are exhausted - they come into the 0z

offices which are now strangely empty They do not speak but

both head for the bedroom Richard flops onto the bed Louise

sits down next to him Richard looks at Louise - he is unsure
what this means Louise pushes off her shoes —

RICHARD
So does this mean you’re having me
back

LOUISE

No it does not

LOUISE
Look I’m only here because I’ve
got nowhere else to stay

She puts a row of pillows between them

RICHARD
Are you absolutely sure I’m ever
so sorry you know

LOUISE
I am not doing this because of you
I am doing this for the magazine

RICHARD
Oh

LOUISE
I am serious Richard If they win
this and close down Oz - it means
they can effectively censor
whatever they like Not just
“Hippie” magazines the TV the
newspapers everything It’s about
being able to talk about the world
and what its doing outside your
door

(MORE )

LOUISE (contd)
Thats why I came back - not for
some juvenile relationship that was
going nowhere

RICHARD
So youll definitely not sleep with

RICHARD
Not even for moral support
Please Pretty please

Louise is not amused She turns the light off

LOUISE
Get some sleep Richard Youve a
big day tomorrow

INT FIRST DAY IN COURT DAY

Richard Felix and Jim are brought in They look around In

the balcony one section is the dull grey of the press corps

who are sat next to Vivian Katie and Charlie accompanied by
hoards of unruly school children crushed in with Jill Neville

and finally the Hippies who are a glorious profusion of

colour Richard looks at row after row of enthusiastic 0z
supporters Richard feels much more confident He gives a an
vague smile Then in come the jury They are complete stony
faced middle class middle aged middle Englanders Richard’s
face falls He sees the prosecutor Leary who is more slick
and tanned than any lawyer has the right to be They all
stand for the Judge who is almost a caricature of a hanging
Judge pince-nez and fearsome expression

FELIX
Fucking heli We’1l be hung
drawn ‘n’‘ quarterd

John Mortimer comes over — he looks distinctly hung over He
knocks back a little snifter from a hip flask

JOHN MORTIMER
Hair of the dog A bit fragile Had
an opening night last night Good
luck chaps

Richard looks at Felix - they acknowledge that this is a
nightmare They look at Jim who smiles benignly - as from
another planet Widgery comes rushing in He comes up to
Richard

WIDGERY
Sorry I’m late Here’s your notes -
just try to stick to the argument
and everything will be fine

Richard looks at the thick pile of paper entitled “A Marxist
Analysis of the Censorship Question”

RICHARD
But this is complete gobbledy-gook

WIDGERY
Don‘t forget the stuff about the
Paris Commune and youll be fine
Look Ill keep popping in every
few days

RICHARD
What do you mean - youre supposed
to be my lay counsel

WIDGERY
Sorry I forgot about my finals I
really have to go Good luck

The Judge looks disdainfully at Richard Jim and Felix

JUDGE

Oh dear oh dear oh dear
RICHARD

Oh fuck
JIM

(off his head)
Is anything the matter

CUT TO

John Mortimer looking distinctly groggy stands to give his
opening address speech

JOHN MORTIMER
Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury
in my view this is a very very
important case a very important
case indeed -—

He seems to be lost but gathers himself

JOHN MORTIMER
As it is this case which stands at
the very crossroads of our nation’s
liberty and the boundaries of our
freedom to think and say what we
please It is a case which will not
only decide the fate of a whole
generation but whether every single
one of us goes forward to a new
world of freedom or backwards to an
age censorship and fear

The hungover Mortimer is brilliant

JOHN MORTIMER
Members of the Jury we are all of
us entitled to disagree with their
views

(MORE)

JOHN MORTIMER (contd)
but this is a case about whether or
not they are also entitled to
isagree with ours

You will hear a lot about the basic
beliefs which these young people
hold Basic beliefs with which few
of us would quarrel That Peace is
preferable to war That racial
tolerance is preferable to
intolerance That love is
preferable to hatred That
expression is preferable to
censorship

We see that the kids the hippies the press and even the
court officials are hanging on his every word

Those of you familiar with history
may have heard of the trial of
Socrates who was put to death for
corrupting the morals of young —
people merely because he asked
“why Surely in any civilized
world it must be a right to ask
why So ladies and gentlemen of the
jury you are not simply being
asked to decide the fate of these
young people but of our entire
society

Everybody is riveted drawn in by the importance of it all

FELIX
Bloody hell I thought I was just a
smelly little hippie

CUT TO
THE CRY OF THE COURT OFFICIAL

COURT OFFICIAL
The prosecution call Detective
Inspector Luff

ANOTHER OFFICIAL
(repeating)
Inspector Luff

CUT TO

Richard widge and Felix watch closely as Geoffrey
interrogates detective Luff Jim is waving merrily in the
dock oblivious to the proceedings

GEOFFERY
Detective Luff - you visited the Oz
offices many times How would you
describe them

LUFF
Dirty

Everyone laughs

GEOFFERY
Is that as in ‘unclean’ or
‘sexually explicit’

LUFF
Both sir

GEOFFERY
So do you think the underground
press has a right to exist in this
country

LUFF
As far as Oz is concerned - I think
it is undesirable - from a family
point of you In the issue in
question there are 15 separate
descriptions of fellatio 2
allusions to homosexuality not to
mention the disgusting picture of
Rupert the Bear

GEOFFERY
So youve read the magazine several
times now

LUFF
Indeed I have

GEOFFERY
And presumably you have become
insanely depraved

LUFF
I most certainly have not

GEOFFERY
So in fact reading Oz has had no
ill effects on you what so ever

LUFF
Well I suppose it has had a
tendency to make me think about
sucking penis

Big laugh from the courtroom Richard is clearly delighted
Jim is looking the other way - completely off his head

OFFICIALS VOICE
The defence call — Mister Edward De
Bono

Edward de Bono the rather slick Maltese psychiatrist takes
the stand

FELIX
Were really scraping the barrel
here

RICHARD

Be quiet He’s doing this as a
family favour

Leary steps forward to cross examine him

LEARY
As an eminent psychologist and
expert witness would you care to
tell me what on the women on the
cover are doing

EDWARD DE BONO
Holding hands

LEARY
It matters not that they are
holding hands Mr De Bono but that
one woman has the other womans
nipple in her mouth In that case
could I draw you to the back cover
Is that or is it not a dil dol

EDWARD DE BONO
I beg your pardon

LEARY
I believe that’s what it is called
Is she or isn’t she holding a dil
dol

EDWARD DE BONO
I don’t understand what you‘re
talking about

ARGYLE
Would you understand if I called it
an imitation male penis

EDWARD DE BONO
I think in that case the word
male would be unnecessary

The court erupts in laughter Leary is clearly getting
agitated

LEARY
But you still don’t think it’s
obscene

(MORE )

LEARY (contd)
Surely there must be something you
find negative about the magazine

Edward de bono thinks

EDWARD DE BONO
It’s prose style

EXT COURT DAY
Richard Felix and Jim walk out

FELIX
It’s going to be a piece of piss

As they walk out of the court a massive cheer is raised by
the crowd waiting They walk through like celebrities - Felix
signing copies of Oz Jim talking to some long haired people
with “Gay power” badges

INT OZ OFFICE’‘S LONDON DAY

Richard Felix Jim and Louise walk into the office It is
full of young people manning the phones A poster says The
Oz defense campaign A cheer goes up as the defendants enter
the room Richard realises he doesn’t recognise a single
face He goes into his bedroom which is also full of people
A sexy school-girl is sitting on his bed

RICHARD
Hi
GIRL 1
Hi You’re Richard Neville aren’t
you
RICHARD
Yes
GIRL 1

I really admire what you’re doing
I could blow you if you want

RICHARD
No thank you I don’t think that’s
necessary

GIRL 1

Please yourself

She goes off in search of Felix Richard has a moment on his
own

INT MARTIN’S FLAT THE SAME

Martin is looking in the mirror He has just shaved and
cleaned himself up after his making his huge piece of art

We don’t see what it is but he folds it up and neatly places
it in a box He packs the few possessions he has into a bag
Tt is clear that he is leaving

INT COURT NEW DAY
Richard Jim and Felix are in the dock

COURT OFFICIAL
The crown calls Mr Felix Dennis

Felix is all puffed up Some fans whistle from the balcony
the Judge shouts “Order” Finally he stands before Leary in
the witness box

LEARY
Mr Dennis you were were you not
responsible for publishing the
comic strip on page twenty of
Rupert the Bear

FELIX
I suppose so Although it was
actually drawn by one of the school
kids

LEARY
Indeed and it was one of your
“school kids” who had Rupert - in
the second frame - inspect a young
lady’s vagina whilst saying the
words “Ill be blowed - she’s a
virgin

Laughter from the gallery

LEARY

The bear then appears to penetrate
the young lady As a publisher - do
you think this is reasonable
behavoir for a young bear

(no immediate answer)
How old do you think the bear is in
question

FELIX
Ive no idea

LEARY
Rupert does go to school does he
not

FELIX
But it’s just a cartoon
LEARY
So what was the purpose in
equipping Rupert with such an
unfeasibly large penis

FELIX
We didn’t know the exact
proportions Usually theyre hidden
under their fur

LEARY
Are you refusing to see that an
outsize organ is in some minds a
badge of masculinity And that’s
why you equipped Rupert with this
unfeasibly large penis

FELIX
What size do you think would be
normal

A huge laugh from the gallery Felix smiles over at Richard
He seems to be running rings around Leary then the Judge
completely changes the mood by screaming

ARGYLE
SILENCE IN COURT I WILL NOT HAVE
LAUGHTER IN THIS COURT

This is like the thunder of god Even Leary is shaken
Richard and Jim jump to attention like schoolboys

ARGYLE
Mr DennisIt is not your place to
interrogate the counsel

LEARY
0 will you not admit that by
depicting bestial sex between a
cartoon bear and a young lady you
were simply seeking to be obscene

FELIX
Well no - shagging a bear might be
obscene but drawing a cartoon’s
different from actually doing it I
think war is obscene but I don‘t
think reporting a war is

LEARY
But it would appear to me Mr Dennis
that you are trying to have
everything both ways I fail to
see how you can purport to have a
satirical magazine that does not
offend people

FELIX
We were just having a bit fun

LEARY
Exposing children to bestiality

FELIX
But it isn’t bestiality Rupert
isn’t a real bear

Leary flicks through the magazine

LEARY
Adverts for casual fellatio the
promotion of illegal drugs
drawings of lesbians engaged in all
kinds of degrading acts Of course
its shocking or else there‘d be no
point in you printing it would
there Mr Dennis

FELIX
Look there’s plenty of shocking
things in the Bible - why don’t you
go and ban that for godsake

LEARY
Answer the question Why publish a
satirical magazine if you dont
wish to offend anybody The whole
raison d’etre of Oz is to offend
Is it not Mr Dennis

Felix is caught - he blushes Leary looks very pleased with
himself Mortimer and Geoffrey look concerned The whole mood
is changing Richard and Jim now look genuinely frightened
Richard looks up at Louise for support She looks back -—
without smiling

LEARY
No further questions

SMASH CUT TO

THE USHER
The court calls Mr James Anderson
RICHARD
Whatever you do - try not to be
controversial
JIM

Dont worry - he’s not going to
catch me out
Jim has great trouble getting out of the box
CUT TO
Jim is in the dock - he looks terrified
LEARY

Do you think the cover of this
magazine is attractive

JIM

They are quite nicely printed
LEARY

The lesbians And the “dildos”
JIM

The dildo
LEARY

A representation of the erect male
penis Do you find the erect male
penis attractive

Jim hesitates — he knows he will be tricked

JIM
I’m sorry Could you repeat the
question

LEARY
Do you find an erect penis
attractive
(pause)
Are you married Mr Anderson

JIM
No

LEARY
So you have no children of your
own

Leary raises an eyebrow to the jury

JIM
No But I am very fond of them

Leary raises another eyebrow to the jury

LEARY
Really

JIM
Before we go any further - I just
want to say “I think people should
be allowed to do exactly as they
please as long as it doesnt hurt
anyone else”

LEARY
Thank you Mr Anderson So would
you see it as a good thing if
parents masturbated in front of
their children for example

Jim hesitates - is it a trick question

JIM
No

Richard is relieved that this is the correct answer

LEARY
Bh —

JIM
But it would obviously depend on
the family circumstances

Richards expression of despair

LEARY
I’m sorry Would you like to repeat
that

JIM

But It would depend on the
familycircumstances Is that the
wrong answer

LEARY
Not at all You have been an
excellent witness Mr Anderson

RICHARD
(to Widge)
Oh shit

We focus on Richard’s face Then we cut to him in the dock -
we focus on his failing confidence as he hears a battery of
abuse from Leary It is an expressionistic account of his
time in the dock just as he is about to answer one question
we cut to him being barraged by another The sequence is cut
together increasingly fast so at the end we feel Richards
profound exhaustion

LEARY
Do you really think this is not
obscene Have you ever taken
drugs Do you really expect us to
believe Have you any idea what
you are doing

Still focused on Richards face we hear the Judge pronounce

ARGYLE
(off)
Court adjourned till tomorrow at
nine thirty

As the crowd in the gallery disperse we see Martin has been
standing anonymously at the back unnoticed by anyone because
he is cleaned up He has the box under his arm

INT OUTSIDE THE COURTROOM DAY

Richard walks miserably with Felix and Jim But this time a
group of conservative protestors against Oz have joined the
fray and Richard et al are jostled between both groups as
they make their way - shell-shocked out of the court
Richard is hit in the face by a placard wielded by an irate
protestor

INT OZ OFFICE’S LONDON NIGHT

Richard and Louise come into the office This time everybody
has gone home

RICHARD
I‘m starting to think I ama
pervert

Richard goes through to his bedroom and flops down on the
mattress Louise sits on the bed

RICHARD
Theyre going to crucify us After
all this They’‘re going to send us
down tomorrow

Suddenly there is a knock on the door Richard looks Louise

RICHARD
Won’t they ever leave us alone

Louise goes to the door opens it No one is there Just a
box with an envelope stuck to it saying “to Richard and
Louise” Louise brings it inside and opens the envelope

LOUISE
“From Martin”
Richard takes Martin’s box and opens it It is a piece of art
folded up Little arrows explain how to open it - Richard and
Louise unfold each “wing” folds out till it fills the entire
room It is a brilliant collage of their whole time together
Martin has observed every moment Richards longing Louises
innocence he has taken pictures of their bliss together the
fun they‘ve all had It is a history of the whole magazine
but more particularly of Richard and Louise’s relationship
It is clearly a love letter to them both Martin clearly
adores Louise The last image is of the three of them all
looking separate ways There is a real sense of wistfulness
of time passed

LOUISE
It’s beautiful

RICHARD
We really had something for a
moment didn’t we All of us But we
fucked it up - didn’t we

LOUISE
No Things are just a little more
complicated than we thought How do
you know where you want to stop
until you’ve gone too far

RICHARD
But they’ve got us They’ve won
Louise

LOUISE

Won Are you out of your mind

You‘re on the front of every

newspaper in the land The Beatles

have written a song about you

Youve got them on the ropes How
many people read the magazine
Pifty thousand Richard there are

millions of people following this

trial Weve started to think that

it is all over - but maybe it

hasnt even started yet You can’t

give up yet You have to go in

there fighting

RICHARD
But they’re right It is obscene
It doesnt matter but it is
obscene What am I going to say
that could make a difference

LOUISE
Talk about this

They look at Martin‘’s artwork

LOUISE
Tell them what it’s like it’s like
Tell them what we believe in

RICHARD
And what if I fuck it up

LOUISE
Don’t worry -— you’ll make an
excellent martyr

RICHARD
You do realise when I come out I’11
be in my thirties don’t you

LOUISE
This is what you’re good at
Bringing people together
explaining whats important You
can do this Richard

Richard looks at Martins work He looks wistfully at him and
Louise

RICHARD
You know I’d give anything to be
back there with you

LOUISE
I know

They kiss
LOUISE

No Richard I don’t think this is

a good idea
He kisses her again she yields They make love
INT RICHARDS’S BEDROOM MORNING
Richard and Louise wake up There are no pillows between
them The alarm clock is going They are both a little

embarrassed and awkward with each other

RICHARD
I guess this is it

They both dress in silence back to back Richard wearing a
suit and tie Richard finally turns to Louise

RICHARD
How do I look
EXT BOW STREET DAY

Richard and Louise anxiously push their way through the
crowd

INT TOILET BOW STREET MAGISTRATES COURT THE SAME

Richard alone in a cubicle -— contemplating his future
Outside the window we can hear people chanting “Oz Oz” He
looks green around the gills but straightens his tie

INT COURT DAY

He pushes his way past the journo’s into the court It’s all
very threatening Richard seems very nervous very small

INT COURT ROOM DAY

Richard enters the court It seems oppressive The jurors
implacable the supporters glum Felix and Jim look
positively scared It is serious and threatening Leary
breezes in cheerily a man of confidence Luff stares at
Richard with a sneer of vindictive smugness

COURT USHER
Mr Neville

Richard gets up and walks from the dock to take a place on
the court floor He is nervous - all eyes on him The press
corps ready to take down every word All faces anxiously
looking at him He looks around - almost faint with
nervousness

INT COURT THE NEXT DAY

Richard stands up We feel the anticipation He is
overwhelmed He looks at Louise then at the stony faced
jurors then he sees Martin at the back of the gallery
Martin winks at Richard Richard stares back surprised to see
him Everyone is agog He remembers himself and starts
speaking

RICHARD
You may be asking why one of us has
chosen to defend himself It is
because I have no wish to hide
behind the gowns and wigs of the
legal profession This is too
serious to be left to lawyers

Big laugh

RICHARD
I came to London to have a great
time to see the world to fall in
love

(MORE)

RICHARD (contd)
And I did I saw the world or at
least the less salubrious parts of
Notting Hill and I did fall in
love

He looks at Louise Then breaks off as he is overwhelmed with
emotion and put off his stride He picks up the magazine as
if getting courage to carry on

RICHARD
But as time has gone on I realise
there is something much more
important at stake Sometimes to
live a life well you have to make
choices You have to suddenly grow
up and realise the world is not
exactly how you wish it to be And
you have to stand up and accept
responsibility - even if the cost
is very high — one has to trust
your fellow man wether they have
long hair or Judges wigs or
whatever A grown up society is one
where we can tolerate and trust
each other and embrace our youth
this is the responsibility that
freedom demands

Richard holds up the magazine

RICHARD
I did not edit this magazine There
are many things in it I might have
done differently Many things I
oppose But it is the voice of our
youth and maybe we should pay
attention It might seem strange to
our ears but if you listen to what
they are struggling to say youll
find basic beliefs with which few
of us would quarrel That Peace is
preferable to war That racial
tolerance is preferable to
intolerance That love is
preferable to hatred

Everyone is rapt by Richards performance

RICHARD
One of the strangest and most
menacing allegations levelled
against us is that we are part of a
community without love who worship
sex for itself But for a while
there was so much love around that
a whole generation almost died of
an overdose

(MORE)

RICHARD (contd)
Among young people love has no
power or magic if it means just
loving your wife until the divorce
and meanwhile hating black people
homosexuals communists Love
entails tolerance and compassion -—
not for the person you want to
possess but for those people who
are in need of it most But
sometimes our horizons are limited
because we are so busy trying to
survive in a frenzied and confusing
world we find it difficult to care
for those who most need it

Looks again at Louise

What we tried to do in Oz was
redefine love to broaden it
extend revitalize it It is true
that it includes sexuality But
only in an effort to make it more
healthy and honest We don’t always
get it right sometimes we are
crude sometimes we miss the point
You don’t have to endorse what we
say You just need to want a
society that confirms the values of
tolerance reason freedom and
compassion A society where every
single one of us can live together
in peace and understanding

He looks directly at Louise She has tears in her eyes Even
the jurors are moved He sits down It has been a stunning
speech

FELIX
Fucking hell Rich Where’d you
learn to do that

People start to cheer and applaud Richard The audience rise
to give Richard a standing ovation - when Argyle bangs his
gavil violently

ARGYLE
ORDER ORDER Members of the Jury
Despite the best claims of Mr
Neville this is not a trial about
big issues but of a little magazine
concerned not with love but sex
sex sex Sex with school kids
with dildos even with animals
This is not a trial about society
The question is is this a dirty
magazine

WIDGE
(to Richard)
He cant do this He’s leading the
jury

MORTIMER GEOFFERY
Objection — your honour Objection

ARGYLE

Objections over ruled

(he quotes)
“TI can open my throat pretty well
if a guy has a really long cock I
dig fucking too but i really love
sucking” You heard from witnesses
who swear at their children and
think it appropriate to have sex on
the pavement Some of these open
minded libertarians even wanted to
ban the Bible

RICHARD
This is ridiculous Our case is
unrecognisable in your mouth

ARGYLE
Silence in court If 0z is a window
on the counterculture - I suggest
it needs cleaning

As Argyle speaks we pan along the grave faces of Felix and
Jim resting on Richard who looks thoroughly defeated

INT OUTSIDE THE COURT ROOM DAY

Crowds of discontented well wishers gather round Richard
Felix Jim and Widge who are with Geoffery and Mortimer

WIDGERY
This is outrageous It’s a travesty
of justice

FELIX
He can’t say that We must be able
to do something

GEOFFERY
The only recourse at this stage is
to the Court of Appeal

RICHARD
So we’re absolutely screwed then

MORTIMER
Let’s not get over excited But
basically yes
Suddenly there is a commotion - “They’ve made a decision”
Everybody returns to the court Louise tries to grab
Richard’s arm as he is bundled along the corridor

LOUISE
It was a beautiful speech Richard

But Richard is swept away and Louise is left standing unsure
if Richard heard her or not

INT COURT DAY

We follow Richard in close up as he comes into the court We
can see the fear and tension in his face he slowly makes his
way to the dock with Jim and Felix Everyone takes their
seats Richard looks nervously at Louise The jury come in
one by one it is excruciatingly slow The leader of the jury
takes out a piece of paper

ARGYLE
Have you come to a decision

JUROR
No We simply can’t decide

ARGYLE
Well go back till you jolly well
find them guilty Or not guilty

The jurors file out Richard et al are even more wound up

CUT TO

MONTAGE - TIME PASSES - ANXIETY MOUNTS - REPORTERS TALK
ANIMATEDLY ABOUT THE LONGEST TRIAL IN BRITISH HISTORY - THE
HISTORICAL IMPORT - THEN FINALLY THE JURORS FILE IN AGAIN

JUROR
We have a majority verdict

The Judge smiles The court concentrates
ARGYLE
So on the charge of corrupting
public morals what do you find

Long pause

JUROR
Not guilty

Richard looks at Felix in disbelief Argyle practically
snarls

RICHARD
We did it

FELIX
We fucking did it

Jubilation in the court It goes wild Even Court officials
are pleased Argyle seriously pissed off

ARGYLE
Order Order

JUROR
On the charge of publishing an
obscene magazine Guilty as
charged

Suddenly the mood of the caught changes in an instant

MORTIMER
(to Richard)
You got away with the big one The
worst they’‘1ll give you is a
suspended sentence

ARGYLE
Stand up Mr Neville you have very
great ability and great
intelligence I have born in mind
you are a man of previous good
character fifteen months followed
by deportation Mr Anderson twelve
months

Shouts of no Everyone falls into a shocked silence -
reeling from it all going wrong

GEOFFERY
This is a travesty

ARGYLE
Mr Dennis you are younger than the
other two and very much less
intelligent Nine months Jailer
take them down

Richard looks at Louise He is dragged away

EXT BOW STREET DAY

Richard et al are taken out to a van The crowd go mad
Richard passes Martin Martin tries to reach out to him but a

policeman pushes him to one side

MARTIN
Richard

Richard et al are bundled into a van and the doors closed

INT PRISON VAN DAY
They sit glumly

FELIX
(to Jim)
I don’t know why you’re so glum
Finally you’re going to get bummed
senseless for rest of 1971

EXT COURTHOUSE THE SAME

Louise sits on the steps of the court with the debris of the
protest strewn around her Martin comes up and sits beside
her

LOUISE
I thought you were in Australia

MARTIN
Not yet I locked myself away for a
bit Did a lot a thinking Maybe I
did get it wrong I wasn’t as
sorted out as I thought after all
Real Love in the era of Free Love
seems pretty hard to find

LOUISE
I think you were just a bit shy
Martin

MARTIN
Maybe I think what I really wanted
was you

LOUISE

Yes I know But it’s all a bit
late now isn’t it I mean weve
all grown up And I guess we have
to remember the best bits and not
dwell on the regrets

MARTIN
If you say so

LOUISE
Yeah You‘re a very special man
Martin Maybe you werent really
meant for these times

MARTIN
What do you mean I am the fucking
Sixties

LOUISE

You know what I mean

MARTIN
Poor Richard

LOUISE
Yeah Poor Richard

INT PRISON - DAY
They are taken through They walk sheepishly The really hard
prisoners all look on threateningly Richard Felix and Jim

look ill Then one of the prisoners recognises them

INMATE
It’s those hippies from Oz

Everybody stops and cranes to get a good view Then someone

cheers another starts clapping - suddenly they are walking
through the prison with tumultuous applause - like royalty

INT ROOM THE SAME
A warder looks at them sternly

WARDER
off

Their colourful clothes are swapped for prison outfits
Cut to
A barbers chair
RICHARD
No you can’t do this It must be

against the rules

WARDER
Sit down

FELIX
Not my hair man

A large warder pushes Felix down in the chair

FELIX
The bastards

His head is shaved to a crew cut
Cut to

Each of the boys get their hair cut off by the warder with
the trimmer So they are all completely shorn

They sit facing themselves in the mirror Richard and Felix
seem about to cry Jim looks carefully at his new haircut

CUT TO

They are walked through the grim corridors led into a cell
and the doors are banged shut

INT CELL DAY
They sit down - hopelessly

JIM
Well it’s not so bad I did need a
trim

Richard and Felix look at Jim in disgust

FELIX
Do you think theyll give us time
off for having to share a cell with
him

Richard is trying to read Jim is cross legged chanting “Om”
whilst meditating Felix is tapping frustratedly on the
radiator Richard is driven to distraction The cell door
opens

WARDER
Neville A visitor

INT MEETING ROOM GAOL THE SAME

Richard goes into the room and sits down He looks over the
table to see Martin

RICHARD
If youve come to gloat don’t
bother You were right about
everything It’s all a bust I
thought you were supposed to be in
Australia

MARTIN

(joking)
What - and miss you getting sent
down for eighteen months

(in earnest)
I havent come to gloat I’ve come
to say goodbye - properly I don’t
want to leave with any bad
feelings Richard Not after this
After everything I know that
you’‘re the gifted one and you just
think I‘m some schmuck with a
layout board —

RICHARD
How can you say Im the gifted one

MARTIN
But you always were Look - youve
got the limelight you get the
girl You’re even a revolutionary
hero for godsake All I‘ve got is
hiding behind my fucked up
imagination You did it Richard
everything I couldnt You know
when we were both in Sydney I used
to think you were a right wanker

RICHARD
Oh

MARTIN
Well I was wrong You stood up to
them You made it all make sense
Youre a top man Richard Neville

RICHARD
Well when I get out of here I
guess I‘1ll be over in Sydney Maybe
Ill look you up
MARTIN
As long as you don’t try to start
up another magazine
Martin hugs Richard
RICHARD
(deeply moved by Martin)
I fucking love you Martin Sharp
Martin beams

MARTIN
I love you too man

WARDER
Alright alright For godsake

INT PRISON THE SAME
Richard walks through the prison to his cell
INT CELL NIGHT

They are all three in their bunks feeling maudlin and
dejected - already bored with their internment

RICHARD
So what will you do when you get
out
FELIX
Dunno I‘1l probably become a multi-
millionaire publishing magnate with
an international empire What about
you

RICHARD
I intend to move as far away from
you as is geographically possible

FELIX
You can be facetious if you like
Neville But I was just a no hope
shit kicker till I met you guys
And I don’t care what you say OK
we might be banged up in here but
we moved the fucking goalposts
This’1l happen all again Not to
us Maybe But there’1ll always be
another bunch of kids to take them
on from where we left off

RICHARD
Thats the most profound thing Ive
ever heard you say Felix

FELIX
I really mean it Richard You might
be a boring fart but you made my
life richer

RICHARD
What about you Jim

JIM
To be quite honest - if it wasn’t
for the lack of acid -— I’d be quite
looking forward to a bit of time
off

Richard sits in his bunk He takes out an envelope - in it is
a photo of Louise he sticks it on the wall He lies staring
up at it

RICHARD
Well goodnight

Then he hears a faint noise It gets louder He gets up

RICHARD
What’s that noise

The faint chant becomes louder Felix Richard and Jim look
at one another

FELIX
Its coming from outside

They climb up and look out of the tiny barred window of their
cell

JIM
Look can you see it

Richards pov An all night vigil of hundreds of hippies with
“Long Live Oz” banners and lighted candles has congregated at
the perimeter of the fence

EXT THE PRISON THE SAME

We fly over the heads of the thousands of Oz protestors -
hippies schoolkids ordinary people Martin sharp and
Louise They chant “We will not be silenced We will not be
silenced” which moves into ” Long live Oz Long live Oz” All
lit by candle light - as far as the eye can see Traffic is
stopped outside the jail It is a massive demonstration We
cant help being moved by their sincerity

INT CELL NIGHT

EXT LONDON DAY

A black maria leaves the prison Makes its way through London
to the court The van suddenly comes to a halt and Richard et

invisible with his short hair and anonymous Waiting at some
distance he sees Louise He walks up to her slowly

LOUISE

She throws her arms around him and kisses him

LOUISE
You did it You made a difference

LOUISE (contd)
And I know the best moments I spent
with you will be the best moments
of my entire life

But if you really want to be truly
free - you have to be willing to
let some things go

RICHARD
I know
So what do you think you’1l do

LOUISE
I don’t really know yet It’s hard
to know what could compare

RICHARD
(can’t resist the joke)
You’ve not become a lesbian or
anything have you

LOUISE
No Richard

RICHARD
(tears running down his
cheeks )
Well good luck then

LOUISE
Good luck too And thanks for the
ride

They kiss full on the lips for the last time Nothing could
be sadder for both of them but both of them know this is
right They break away knowing that it’s goodbye

RICHARD
You know what Louise
I had the time of my life

Louise is now streaming with tears

LOUISE
Me too

Louise starts walking slowly backwards Richard stands there
watching As The moody blues - Go Now plays she gradually
disappears into a crowd of dancing revellers celebrating the
victory She is gone As the camera soars over the Old Bailey
and the celebrating hippies it descends into the next street
and it is 2007 cars stream by We come down on a newsagent
cabin and see Oz‘s real legacy - all the magazines full of
sex drugs politics The Radio goes from playing the moody
blues to playing the Stone A couple of girls in retro
Sixties clothes walk by

A man in a suit buys a paper we will discover in just a
moment that it is the real Richard neville He winks into the
camera Black out

Louise FERRIER co-founded the Feminist Magazine “Spare Rib”

Richard NEVILLE took lots of drugs shagged his way round
sydney and is a writer still fermenting the Australian
revolution He lives with his wife and children in the Blue
Mountains National Park in New South Wales Australia Cue a
song

“May God bless and keep you always
May your wishes all come true

May you always do for others

And let others do for you

May you build a ladder to the stars
And climb on every rung

May you stay forever young”

A shot of Richard with his family on a verandah Behind them
is the Blue Mountain’s National Park in blissful sunlight We
feel Richard made good in the end He looks tanned and happy
in contrast to his tormented early self

THE END
