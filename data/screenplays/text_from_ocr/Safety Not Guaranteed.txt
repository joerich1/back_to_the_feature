DARIUS (FEMALE VO)
Well from like the beginning

INT SUBURBAN BACKYARD - 1995 - DAY

Kids run and play in a yard decorated for a little girl’s
birthday Under a HAPPY 7th BIRTHDAY DARIUS banner we see
MR and MRS BRITT looking around for their daughter Isolated
from the frolicking kids a pair of little eyes peek through
a slot in a large cardboard box

DARIUS (VO)
Grew up in New Jersey - wait
before that I guess my parents
decided to give me a black man’s
name Which was awesome

EXT SUBURBAN CONSTRUCTION SITE - 1988 - DAY

Dad circa 1988 smiles with unbridled excitement as he tours
his new house-under-construction with pregnant Mom in an
upper middle class suburb

DARIUS (VO)
They always said they just thought
Darius sounded pretty but I think
they did it to deal with guilt

Dad’s smile turns awkward when he locks eyes with one of the
BLACK WORKERS shoveling dirt under the brutal summer sun

DARIUS (VO)
So grew up there with them

INT BMW CONVERTIBLE - 2002 - DAY

13 year-old DARIUS BRITT’S long dark hair whips wildly in the
backseat behind her parents in a convertible BMW

crisis right when I hit middle

The BMW drives off as Darius her hair now a wild afro joins
a motley group of AWKWARD FRIENDS

INT MACARONI GRILLE - DAY

DARIUS 22 as pretty as a smart funny girl can be regards
the tanned RESTAURANT MANAGER across the table from her in
this gallery of forgettable birthday dinners

DARIUS

RESTAURANT MANAGER
(not amused)
Usually people just say where
they’re from and where they worked
before

DARIUS
Great I’m already overqualified

RESTAURANT MANAGER
So in any of your previous jobs
can you tell me one instance in
which you went above and beyond the
call of duty for a customer

Darius lets a laugh slip out

DARIUS
What would I be doing here
Fighting fires and saving lives I
thought this was for a waitress

The Manager sweeps her application into a folder

RESTAURANT MANAGER
I’m going to be honest I’m not
sure your attitude fits what we
look for in customer service

Darius gives him a wide eyed look She looks prettiest when
not on the offense
DARIUS
Wait I mean I could make something
up When I worked at Fridays I
donated bone marrow once to a guy
who got a Mr Pibb instead of Coke

RESTAURANT MANAGER
You think you’re too good for this
Why are you even here

DARIUS
I’m sorry I really need the money
I work my ass off all day at an
internship I just need something
to get by until I break in to the
paid world

RESTAURANT MANAGER

can tell your type Difficult bad
attitude You’re just not a quality

Darius struggles under a Costco megapack of toilet paper
INT FACSIMILE - ELEVATOR - DAY

The elevator doors press against the massive economy bundle
giving Darius time to squeeze into the crowded elevator

DARIUS
Could someone push three

Faces and shoulders are mashed by the squishy package as she
tries to find a comfortable spot to stand in here She
settles then makes eye contact with a hip ATTRACTIVE GUY

DARIUS
What’s up

INT FACSIMILE - MAIN OFFICE —- DAY

Darius lugs the asswipes through an office designed to look
too casual to be an office On a wall she passes are framed
covers of Facsimile Magazine which appears to blend tech and
pop culture with an ironic spin into a monthly periodical
INT FACSIMILE - BRIDGETTE’S OFFICE - DAY

BRIDGETTE BAY 34 a harshly beautiful editor with a visible
hate for all women younger andor more attractive speaks on
the phone with stress and urgency

Darius leans the megapack on her desk while she fishes change
and a receipt out of her purse

BRIDGETTE
(hand over phone receiver)
Don’t put that there

Darius puts it on the ground

BRIDGETTE
No Put it in the utility closet
and fill all the bathrooms

DARIUS
Yeah I was just giving you this

Bridgette annoyed waves the money away and glares at her
desk where Darius places the change She removes a pack of
tampons from a plastic bag

DARIUS
I got yourstuff too

Bridgette scowls at her The tampons go on the table and
Darius kneels to power squat the economy pack back up

BRIDGETTE
(into phone)
Yeah an intern They need
everything spelled out for them

INT FACSIMILE - BATHROOM - DAY

On her knees Darius has to really lean and tilt her head
dangerously close to the toilet bowl to get the empty paper
roll unlocked She straightens her head and frowns as she
feels the wetness of her soaked hair

DARIUS
Ohhhhh-kay

INT FACSIMILE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
The blinds are closed as the whole office is gathered to

listen to pitches accompanied by slides Bridgette stands
next to a projected slide of two cowgirls kissing on a stage
BRIDGETTE
So the lesbian band story is in for
next month

JEFF SCHWENSEN 29 has a slight Jersey accent and looks like
he could be in a shirtless men’s razor commercial

JEFF
Wasn’t one of the interns in one of
those female bands Who was that

Jeff looks around and stops his eyes on Darius in the back of
the room She doesn’t like being put on the spot

JEFF
It was you right

DARIUS
Yep Played bass We werent a les-
band though

Jeff nods confusedly sure up to now that she was a lesbian
Darius fills the silence

DARIUS
We were called Period Pieces Cause
of the double entendre

Now more silence

BRIDGETTE
Okay What else do we have

Jeff looks over his notes

JEFF
What about the time traveler ad

A blown-up CLASSIFIED AD comes up on the Powerpoint screen
Darius is immediately intrigued by the words that appear

WANTED Someone to go back in time with me This is not a
joke PO Box 322 Ocean View NC 28469 You’1ll get paid
after we get back Must bring your own weapons Safety not
guaranteed

Some LAUGHS around the room

JEFF
So this is an ad someone e-mailed
in taken from the classifieds of a
newspaper I’m thinking kind of a
funny piece about it maybe a
tongue-in-cheek investigation
(MORE)
JEFF (contd)
Who put it up Is it real a prank
Come up with theories and whatnot

BRIDGETTE
You want it It’s yours
JEFF
Can I get a couple interns for

research
Darius’ eyes open This is her chance to escape Bridgette

The socially awkward prematurely balding 22 year-old next to
her ARNAU doesn’t take his eyes off of Darius’ legs

ARNAU
Me too

JEFF

INT FACSIMILE - JEFF’S OFFICE - LATER

A small office Darius and Arnau sit across a desk froma
distracted Jeff who eyes Bridgette through a window

ARNAU
We sent a letter to the address in
the ad and asked them to get back
to us

DARIUS
And I called the local paper but
they’re all uptight and won’t give
out the info on the people that
take out ads

Jeff leans back and runs a hand through his hair

JEFF

Arnau’s mouth freezes in the open position

DARIUS
That’s gross kinda
JEFF
I know Sometimes someone pisses
you off so much you just wanna -

to clear the browsing history

Darius’ father MR BRITT 50 enters the room

A corner booth at a loud dance club Darius and Arnau are
sandwiched between Jeff and ERIC and JON two 25 year-old
guys who spot each other at the gym and take care to avoid
wearing the same Ed Hardy T-shirt when they go out They
listen to Jeff in awe

JEFF
Dude it was fucking insane
I knew from her friend that she had
herpes but I wasn’t supposed to

ERIC

at the table Eric brings her a drink She watches his
primitive grin as he takes in the debauchery on the dance
floor He turns his focus back to her

practiced tone

EXT OCEAN VIEW POSTAL OFFICE - TIME PASSAGE

Darius slumps in the driver’s seat of Jeffs car window
down Arnau sits cross legged on the sidewalk playing his
online game on the laptop Darius sits up

INSIDE THE POST OFFICE

A FIGURE only visible from behind opens box 322 Nothing

across the field at the Datsun

EXT RESEARCH FACILITY - SAME

The Figure exits the car and stands on his toes to see
through a locked fence gate and into the compound He picks
up a clipboard heavy with pages of scrawled notes

This is KENNETH CALLOWAY 28

Not bad looking at all but off His hair facial

expressions style everything just a bit off A few nucleic
acid sequences away from being a happy human

He jots down a note nods with a serious determination that
is slightly comical given his odd mullet haircut then gets
back into his car

INT U-SAVE - NIGHT

We track behind Kenneth pushing a pallet of detergent through
the lonely aisles of the 24 hour warehouse superstore

Darius appears from behind discreetly trailing him
INT U-SAVE - LATER

Kenneth speaks to SHANNON 63 an aging black man with a
weary face as they stock shelves Darius pretends to browse
nearby as she listens

KENNETH
The economy isn’t a fixed thing
People think because that’s how it
is now then that’s how it’1ll always
be but they’re just looking at
this narrow band of time when if
you look at the big picture the
distribution of wealth has been
steadily spreading out from
aristocratic society to slave
economy to industrial and on and on
in both directions

SHANNON
I gotta do a bathroom check
brother To be continued

KENNETH
Yeah okay It’s just amazing how
they can get these people to vote
against their economic interests
Like it or not it’s historically
headed in one direction they’re
just delaying the inevitable

Kenneth continues stocking Darius walks past and eyeballs
his name tag as he stretches to reach the high shelf

INT U-SAVE - MOMENTS LATER
Darius approaches a SHIFT MANAGER pen and card in hand

Excuse me I wanted to fill outa
comment card about one of your

The Shift Manager points at his head

DARIUS
No It’s a positive comment Like
complimenting him

SHIFT MANAGER
Oh Oh Good Kenneth Calloway

DARIUS
Thank you

They look across the jewelry displays and spot Kenneth who
makes a dramatic spin scoops up a stray can on the floor and
re-stocks it with an unusual amount of flair and purpose
before continuing on with that oddly funny focus

about half operational

can of soda Jeff looks over

JEFF

paranoid He nervously picks up a pink rubber coated dumbbell
and starts distractedly doing curls with one arm

head is visible in the mirror He keeps driving

thing A MAN and WOMAN occupy the RECEPTIONIST so Jeff drifts
back against the far wall and surveys the interior

His hopeful eyes settle on a thin BLOND who turns around and
reveals her face Not her Jeff scans the other stylists He
finally focuses on a wood cutting of the name LIZ in one
stylists’ area He studies the woman cutting hair there

LIZ CLEARY 30 is more than a little on the heavy side has
brown hair pale skin and generally does not match Jeffs
description of a sun-kissed beach blond hottie

Jeff stares at her the brightness fading from his eyes

He turns and exits the salon

sized stadium Two high school teams take the field

past the seated band pounding their drums to the top row

bullshit or if you’re legit

KENNETH

face

Darius isn’t threatened by his awkward attempt at rage

DARIUS
I don’t want to get jerked around

KENNETH

EXT HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STADIUM - OTHER BLEACHERS

Jeff and Arnau sit a good distance away watching Darius from
afar Jeff opens a small cooler and forces a beer on Arnau
before taking one for himself Jeff breathes in

JEFF
God I remember that smell The
smell of grass you know And the
sound of the drums

ARNAU
You should give Liz a chance That
sucks to spend all those years
wondering about her and you’re
finally here and you don’t go
through with it

JEFF
All that time I was wondering
About her she didn’t look like a
female butcher

ARNAU
That’s sad if the love of your
youth was just based on what a girl
looked like in her bikini
JEFF
Naw it’s not like that It wasn’t
her looks She had the hottest
southern accent And she was so I
don’t know warm I don’t know how
to describe it

ground The Jock then slaps Beefhead’s hand holding his
fountain soda causing it to spill all over Kenneth

Darius looks at the Jock as if to speak but SLAPS his
elbow knocking his fountain soda into his own face

JOCK

The other teens pull him back as Kenneth leads Darius away

KENNETH
Id have really messed them up if I
wasn’t trying to keep a low
profile But I’m glad I got to see
your qualities

KENNETH (contd)
I think you’re ready for the next
phase some basic training

Kenneth spots the Jock approaching with another DEPUTY SHERIFF

KENNETH
The heat’s moving in That’s all
for tonight

The Jock points her out to the Deputy Sheriff

JOCK

my drink

Darius turns back to Kenneth but he’s gone One with the
night She sighs and turns to face the music

kicked out of a high school
football game

INT KENNETH’S DATSUN - NIGHT

Kenneth climbs into his seat He looks at the Coke stain on
his shirt He SLAPS the steering wheel over and over This
isn’t the first time he’s been humiliated

He performs a few karate moves with his arms complete with
self-generated sound effects re-playing in his mind what he

wished he could’ve done to those guys

The driver’s side window FALLS in its slot disappearing into
the door Kenneth stops and looks at his broken window

CUT TO
EXT WOODS - DAY

BLAM Darius fires a 22 handgun in a remote woodland A
bottle on a fallen tree shatters Kenneth nods

KENNETH
Nice You smoked it

Kenneth pushes PLAY on a cassette deck boom box he’s hung
from a branch by its strap

Cheap Trick’s cheesy 80’s anthem “MIGHTY WINGS” plays as
recorded off of the radio two decades ago

Kenneth nods to the music really finding the elusive zone
through its lyrics then fires his gun at a bottle The top
chips off and he finishes it off with two more shots

DARIUS
I’m getting better than you All I
need is one shot

Kenneth insulted takes her joke personally

KENNETH
It’s easy to shoot standing still
with no pressure

Kenneth runs a few steps then takes a dramatic stance with
both knees bent both arms extending his gun out and FIRES

KENNETH
But you have to be able to shoot on
the move

Kenneth spins and fires off two more shots

KENNETH
--with the heat flying by

He drops to a knee and FIRES then pulls out a backup gun

KENNETH
-do what I’m doing Come on

DARIUS
Really

Kenneth ducks behind a tree faking like he’s under fire
then spins out from the cover and shoots a bottle It all
looks very awkward and slowly paced

KENNETH
Come on

Darius imitates him but with only a fraction of his effort
and intensity

KENNETH
Smoke it Come on smoke it

Darius fires some shots

KENNETH
They’re closing in Smoke ‘em

DARIUS
Okay just shut up

Darius finally hits a bottle

KENNETH
Yeah You smoked him

DARIUS

They freeze as the man screams toward them

MAN IN FLANNEL

hole in my swimming pool you
jackasses

DARIUS
Should I smoke him

KENNETH
Run go

Darius and Kenneth take off into the woods The Man in
Flannel huffs and puffs but just stops hands on hips

Running side by side Darius sneaks a sideways peek at
Kenneth’s face as he runs She can’t help but burst out in
laughter at the comical severity of his expression as he
breathes rapidly in and out through his O-lips

Kenneth tones it down as they slow their clip

KENNETH
What

She just keeps laughing good-naturedly Kenneth cracks a
smile too Soon they’re both laughing hard

Darius and Kenneth at a booth in the country kitchen

KENNETH
It’s important that we don’t abuse
the power that will come with our
knowledge of the future No matter
how tempting it might be to be the
first poster on a message board to
“find” all the secrets of the
newest video games Or to say you
know hey I think that Battlestar
Galactica show might really be
awesome before anyone else is
talking about it

DARIUS
What about for the betterment of
future society assassinating
certain celebrities when they were
vulnerable before they got famous
and got entourages

Absolutely not We must stick to
the plan

SNAPS the ear back into place

Kenneth has his head on the wheel Darius leans down

to be embarrassed about Shit
people made fun of me too I wax
my lip and shave my arms I know
it’s not the same but I get it

until I was fifteen

Darius places a gentle hand on Kenneth’s tense shoulder He
reacts like it’s electricity like human contact is something
he’s starved of and he just tasted the best kind there is
KENNETH
We can still do this if we just
never talk about it again Please

So then what’d you tell him your
reason for going to 2003 is

DARIUS
I just made up some story

ARNAU
Yeah what’s the story

DARIUS
I told him I wanted to go back and
stop my parents from getting
divorced

Jeff enters the room a bounce in his step

JEFF
There he is

Jeff slaps Arnau’s back

JEFF
Arnau the man

ARNAU
What are you doing

JEFF
Whatever I’m doing I’m feeling
fucking fantastic doing it

DARIUS
Did you just have sex with that fat
girl you came here to stalk

JEFF
No we didn’t We shared nice
conversation And she’s not that
fat

(MORE)

JEFF (contd)
A girl’s beauty is it’s in the
eyes you know And that never goes
away

Darius does the jack-off motion

DARIUS
No wonder you didn’t nail her with
lines like that

ARNAU
So anyways for the article we
should know what’s wrong with this
guy Like low IQ or emotional
disorder or whatever it is

DARIUS
What makes you think he’s ‘got’
something

ARNAU
He thinks he’s going back in time

DARIUS
So Did Einstein have something
wrong with him Or David Bowie

ARNAU
What

DARIUS
Maybe he’s just a guy trying to do
something new What makes that such
a freak show

Jeff watches Darius with curiosity as he cracks a beer

JEFF
So you think it’s normal

DARIUS
I don’t know Is it normal that
your interns do all the work on
your story Is that how all your
articles get written

JEFF
I’m better at running things
Leading I’m not good with like
words and shit and making sentences
sound good

DARIUS
That’s probably kind of important
being that your job is writing

JEFF
I never thought of myself as a
writer I got the job off of
something I wrote in college but
it took me all fucking year to
write that thing And it only
turned out so good because it was
about the one thing I could get
into and really write well about
It’s funny how you can do one thing
and you just become that guy Your
whole life gets defined by it And
it was just like an accident in the
first place

What was it about

Darius’ cell RINGS She looks at the name

twenty-one Her birthday was the

pretty When she first started
working at the restaurant I didn’t
really think about her But then
she was so nice to me She’d get me
food She’d talk to me while I
cleaned up Everyone else was off
getting ready to go out all her
friends But she’d sit there on the
stool and talk to me

She died Some jerk some a-hole
jerk in a band who got drunk after
his show crashed his car into her
house one night A night I was
supposed to be there but wasn’t I

KENNETH
Everyone always says there’s plenty
of other girls out there But it
doesn’t work like that It’s not
just about the girl it’s about a
time and a place You just can’t go
find that again

comfortable in this odd place and company

in the Boy Scouts

(MORE)

KENNETH (contd)
Some of the other kids used to make
fun of me for bringing my Star Wars
figures with me cause I didn’t
want them to be alone back at my
house so they’d take them and
throw them into the fire and laugh
at me for sleeping with them This
was before my martial arts
training of course I carved out
this hiding spot for them so I
could still take them with me and
no one would hurt them I’d just
sneak down here at night and take
them out then put them back in the
morning

DARIUS
I wish I could see you when you
were a little kid

KENNETH
(snort laughs)
I was not as impressive as I am
now

finger along the wooden disk at the end of the rope tethered
to the trunk by a nail

flat for her

straddles it seated on the disk feet dangling a few feet
off the ground while Kenneth holds it in place

DARIUS
Now what

KENNETH
Hold on

Kenneth SPRINTS forward toward the pond running down the
hill pushing Darius on the swing Their faces are a few feet
apart her eyes wide with surprise his wide with the glee
you normally only see in a child’s

Kenneth pushes her to the lake’s edge and lets go

Darius hands tight on the rope swings free and far out over
the water

She swings back over land Kenneth laughs as he chases her
He grabs onto the disk and tucks up his legs as she begins to
swing back to the lake now with Kenneth hanging on

The two of them soar over the lake At the highest point
Kenneth lets go and splashes into the water

Darius swings back over the land half screaming half
laughing Kenneth motions her into the water with his hands

KENNETH
Come on Jump

Darius makes another pass over him shaking her head ‘no’

KENNETH
How else are you going to get off

Darius swings over the land then clenches her eyes shut as
she flies back over the water She pushes off The swing goes
back alone She plunges into the cold water

She splashes to the surface and swats water at Kenneth who
laughs

To the music a series of shots

-- Kenneth holding Darius’ hand helping her out of the
water

-- Kenneth giving a soaked Darius the only towel out of the
back of the Datsun and helping wrap her up in it

-- Kenneth shivering cold gets a fire started in the camp
fire pit as night falls Darius snug in her towel laughs as
he squats down right in the fire desperate for the warmth

-- They sit by the fire Kenneth lights the wing of a paper
airplane and sends it on a fiery flight
Darius takes his head in her hands so softly He’s paralyzed
Her hands run over his ears Kenneth’s hand defensively grabs
her wrist to pull it away from his prosthetic but then he
relaxes and lets her arm go
She kisses him

my friends were like why are you
dating this guy But he was really
fun and funny I remember he had
all these little insecurities He’d
never let me touch his head And he
got real serious real fast you
know I guess we’ve all had one of
those guys right

Belinda laughs Darius swallows uncomfortably

BELINDA
We broke up after not long He
quit the restaurant I didn’t see
him for awhile after that Then
there was the accident

DARIUS
What was the accident

BELINDA
He crashed his car into my
boyfriend’s house It was when I
first started dating Rob my
husband He had a show in
Wilmington that night he was ina
band back then Anyways we had a
party at this little house he was
renting at the time after the show
I stayed over and we went to sleep
and next thing we know Kenneth
crashes his car into the front
lawn Went all the way up to the
house put a dent in the wall under
the kitchen window Kenneth seemed
a little drunk I convinced Rob to
let him go before the police came
and we reported it as a hit and
run And now that I think of it
that’s the last time I saw him

EXT BELINDA’S HOUSE - LATER
Belinda waves as Darius makes her exit
BELINDA

Hope I helped It’s Facsimile
Magazine

DARIUS
Yeah Thanks again

Darius walks to the car head spinning

She takes

a few steps down the street before she sees the two

men in black Smith and Jones exit their parked Sedan

Jeff gets
and Jones

DARIUS
Oh shit

out of his car and catches up to Darius as Smith
reach her

SMITH
Excuse me Can we have a moment of
your time

DARIUS
Who are you

SMITH
Nothing to be alarmed about Wed
just like to ask a few questions
about Kenneth Calloway

JEFF
Look we’re just here doing a story
on him We’re not involved in
anything he’s involved with

JONES

We don’t mean to come off the wrong
way We’ve actually talked to
Facsimile magazine and verified
your connection to Calloway

(off Jeffs look)
You talk to people and we talk to
those people It’s our job

DARIUS
What do you want with him

SMITH
We work in the private security
branch of Gower MedLabs Weve been
investigating Calloway for a couple
of years now We suspect him of
being an agent working for a rival
medical research company

DARIUS
Why would you think him

JONES
He’s participated in trial testing
conducted by our company at a
frequency that raised some internal
alarm Turns out he’s repeatedly
applied for various jobs with us
all in unrelated fields

DARIUS
He can’t be a spy

SMITH
He was arrested in Florida for
breaking and entering at one of our
facilities And then there was the
recent robbery at one of the
testing facilities here

JEFF
Oh yeah What’d they take

SMITH
Prototypes for a laser hair removal
system

JONES

Technology that could be very
valuable to a competing
corporation Have you had any
contact with him in the past 24
hours

JEFF
No Darius

Darius shakes her head

DARIUS
You know for sure he was the one
who robbed the research place
Like you have evidence

SMITH
We’re confident Give us a call if
you hear from him

Smith hands Darius a card Jones turns to leave Smith pauses

SMITH

SMITH

JEFF
Oh the story Time travel I don’t
know anymore actually

SMITH

EXT KENNETH’S HOUSE - DAY

The Acura parks in front of Kenneth’s house Jeff looks at
Darius as she opens the door

JEFF
You sure

DARIUS
Yeah

Darius exits the car In the back Arnau awakens and groggily
pokes his head forward

ARNAU
Where are we

JEFF
Sex clinic Romeo You have a
serious problem and need help

EXT KENNETH’S HOUSE - PORCH - DAY
Darius knocks and waits

It’s dark inside the cracked open window She slides the
window up and lifts the screen off its groove She reaches in
shoulder deep around to the door lock and unlocks it

INT KENNETH’S HOUSE - DAY

Gray shafts of daylight reveal the nest of an organized
hoarder Books and magazines piled neatly edges squared but
eating up all of the interior space Some mechanical device
lies in neat pieces on a blanket on the floor

Darius turns sideways to squeeze through the neat chest-high
columns of clutter on her way to the computer in the corner

Darius shakes the mouse and the screen saver blinks off The
computer’s desktop is as cluttered as the apartment She
clicks on a few of the icons finds nothing

She turns her attention to stacks of papers on the desk She
leafs through journal entries and hand-drawn designs of small
component machine parts

Her eyes are drawn to a small pile of photographs on a shelf
She looks through photos of Kenneth at various agesuntil
she stops on one photo in particular An 8 by 10 we only see
the back of This photo makes an impact on her

KENNETH (0S)
Darius What are you doing here

Darius shakes out of the spell and finds Kenneth there

DARIUS
I just came to see what’s going on

KENNETH
Everything’s set I moved the
machine to the launch site
Departure is at five PM Things are
pretty hairy I had to sneak in
through the back cause the spooks
are all over me They could be out
there right now

Kenneth slyly peers out through the closed blinds

DARIUS
Kenneth we need to talk

KENNETH
About what happened last night I
know our working relationship
became complicated but we need to
re-focus and not let it compromise
the mission

DARIUS
No Kenneth I mean I talked to the
guys who are following you They
said you stole those lasers to sell
the technology like you’re some
corporate spy or something

KENNETH
Hah Simpletons Let them think
that it works in our favor

DARIUS
I also talked to Belinda I was at
her house like an hour ago

There’s a subtle twitch in Kenneth’s expression

KENNETH
Wait what What’s going on here
You’re checking up on me

DARIUS
Well yeah Most people that promise
to take me on a journey through
space and time I do a little
research on

KENNETH
I knew it See this whole mission
is getting janked up by you

DARIUS
What’s the mission She’s alive
Kenneth I just saw her You lied
to me about her What else have you
been lying about

EXT KENNETH’S HOUSE - SAME

Waiting inside the Acura Jeff and Arnau see Jones and Smith
pull the black sedan into Kenneth’s drive

JEFF
Shit

Jeff sits up and opens the car door
INT KENNETH’S HOUSE - SAME
Kenneth paces concentrating hard
KENNETH
No no no Don’t you see
Obviously if she’s alive then I’ve

already succeeded in my mission

DARIUS
Kenneth just be honest with me

KENNETH
The question is why I’m not with
her What does it mean
The front door opens Jeff spills into the room
JEFF
Darius fuck They’re right behind

me

Jones and Smith push in right on his heels

KENNETH
You’re with that guy

DARIUS
Kenneth oh God

KENNETH
You’re just like the rest of them
You were making a joke of me

DARIUS
No No I’m not

JEFF
Look man We’re trying to write an
honest story about you for a
magazine Nobody was trying to make
a joke out of you

DARIUS
Jeff don’t -

KENNETH
A magazine story

Kenneth’s face drains His wide hurt eyes fall on Darius

KENNETH
Youve been pretending Darius

JONES
Kenneth Calloway we’re taking you
into custody and transporting you
to Florida to stand trial

Jones and Smith step forward

DARIUS
You guys aren’t cops You can’t
come in here

They brush by Darius and close in on Kenneth

JONES
I have been granted power of
attorney by your bail bondsman to
apprehend you and deliver you to
Clearwater to stand trial

Jones and Smith move to cuff him but Kenneth struggles
KENNETH

You can’t take me now I’m leaving
tonight

Kenneth whips out of their grasp knocking over towers of
folded clothes and magazines spilling onto the floor a flood
of junk that Jones and Smith get caught up in dropping them

Kenneth takes one last pained look at Darius and flees out
the back Jones and Smith scramble to their feet and follow

EXT KENNETH’S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY
Jones and Smith run into the backyard just in time to see
Kenneth vanish into the thick reeds of the wilderness beyond

his property They stop hands on hips

Darius exits the house She shuts her eyes and holds her
hands to her head

DARIUS
I’m such an asshole

Jeff appears behind her
JEFF
So was he really building a time

machine or what

ARNAU (OS)
Hey Check this out It’s open

Darius looks over to the shed The chains on the doors dangle
freely their locks hanging open

INT KENNETH’S HOUSE - SHED - MOMENTS LATER
Darius opens the doors Jeff and Arnau behind her

They enter the shed lit by sunlight filtering in through the
spaces between the roof and walls

It’s mostly empty

The cement floor is largely clean and bare except ina
distinct pattern around the edges suggesting something the
size of a small RV recently rested here

Dozens of tools litter the floor’s edges along with pieces
of tubing pipe gaskets gears and circuit boards

All eyes are drawn to the walls of the shed however They
are covered with DETAILED SCHEMATICS OF THE TIME MACHINE

From the drawing we get the sense of an airboat heavily
modified with extra propeller engines and intricate
machinery It’s impressive It looks like the real deal

ARNAU
Whoa awesome

JEFF
This is fucking fantastic

They look to Darius

ARNAU
You don’t think he really -

JEFF

Holy shit would he already be

gone How would we know
ON DARIUS
Realizing she knows exactly how they’d know
EXT LAKE -— DUSK
Darius hurries down the hill to the base of the tree at the
edge of the lake She reaches her arm into the hollow of the

tree and removes the ammunition tin

She sits down on the hill with the tin on her knees as Jeff
and Arnau approach

She opens it There’s a note inside Her fingers almost
tremble as she reads

ARNAU
What is it

Then we hear the rumbling ROAR of engines in the distance

It’s the sound of raw combustion engine mixed with the
smooth high pitched purring of electric motors

Darius stands drops the note and follows the sound to the
edge of the lake The source quickly becomes visible

It’s incredible

A crazy modified airboat with four propellers multiple
engines and all kinds of tubes and cords and unidentifiable
parts fixed together create an intimidating piece of
machinery floating in the water next to a narrow dock

JEFF
Holy shit

Kenneth stands on a small deck on the machine He flips a
switch

Behind him a raised chassis on the machine begins spinning in
circles so quickly it becomes a dangerous blur of whirling
steel

UP THE HILL

Jones and Smith crest the hill behind them out of breath
They spot the machine and share a bewildered look

ON THE DOCK
Kenneth sees Darius as she runs onto the dock

DARIUS
Kenneth

Kenneth sees Darius He eases a throttle back and the noise
of the engines dies down

DARIUS
Kenneth I’m so sorry

He steps off the machine onto the dock keeping his distance

KENNETH
Were you just making a joke of me
the whole time

DARIUS
No I promise you I lied about the
story but everything else was real
That was really me

Kenneth processes this wanting to believe herthen nods to
himself resolute

KENNETH
Get on

DARIUS
What

KENNETH

I wasn’t going back for Belinda
I’m going back for you I have to
save your mother

Tears appear in Darius’ eyes surprising her

KENNETH
Come with me

Darius looks behind her Jones and Smith are closing in Jeff
and Arnau watch from the shoreline

Kenneth reaches out his hand
Teary-eyed but laughing she takes it

He pulls her onto the time machine and they share a moment
now face to face Kenneth places her hand on a railing

KENNETH
Hold on to this I won’t let you
get hurt
Darius nods He returns to the controls and pushes the
throttle Lights glow and machinery spins as the noise
accelerates
ON THE DOCK

Arnau picks up the fallen note as Jones and Smith walk past
Jeff watches in disbelief

JEFF
What is she doing

ON THE MACHINE
floating away from the dock rocking wildly in the water
Kenneth holds on to the support rail with Darius His wide

eyes look upwards hopeful expectant

As the roaring engines reach a crescendo we hear a loud POP
Kenneth’s expression is invaded by doubt

ON THE MACHINE
Kenneth pushes buttons and checks gauges his face wracked
with desperation The spinning parts are now grinding Smoke

spills upwards

Darius watches Kenneth with a desperate look hoping for
something that is not possible and she knows it

Kenneth shouts at the controls pleading and anguished

His shouts fade with the roar of the engines as the machine
slowly winds down and finally becomes deathly quiet bobbing
on the black water

Kenneth slumps back against the rail

All hope drains from Darius She puts a hand on his

Jeff and Arnau watch silently and sadly from the dock as
Jones and Smith ready their handcuffs

EXT LAKE - SUNDOWN

Kenneth’s despondent face is turned down in the backseat of
the Sedan

He makes eye contact with Darius one last time as Jones and
Smith drive him away

As the car disappears Arnau looks at the note from Kenneth
still in his hand

It reads MISSION ACCOMPLISHED
DISSOLVE TO
INT JEFF’S ACURA - MORNING

The day’s first gasps of sunlight streak through the passing
trees onto the faces of Arnau Jeff and finally Darius ona
melancholy drive out of town

INT FACSIMILE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Bridgette speaks to the Facsimile editorial staff

BRIDGETTE
And so in light of having written a
story that’s gotten the most web
hits in the history of Facsimile
created an internet sensation and
brought unprecedented attention to
our little magazine the least we
can do is promote you to full time
feature writer

As Bridgette speaks we track across the faces in the room
all looking in one direction to Darius whose face we
finally settle on She forces a smile as the room APPLAUDS

BRIDGETTE
Not to mention this is the first
time they’ve ever sold T-shirts on
the internet based on one of our
stories

Bridgette unveils a joke T-shirt with a photo of Kenneth’s
comically serious face next to a blown-up copy of the
classified ad above which is printed SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED
LAUGHS around the room

Jeff looks at Darius who seems a thousand miles away from
the celebratory mood in the room

EXT CITY STREETS - DAY

Darius walks amongst an ocean of exhausted commuters a face
in the crowd

INT SUBWAY - NIGHT
Darius rides alone pensive sad
INT BRITT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Darius sits with Mr Britt and Farid on the couch their
faces lit by the glow of the TV

JAY LENO (ON TV)

Wanted somebody to go back in time
with me This is not a joke Safety
not guaranteed I’ve only done this
once before

Farid chuckles Darius winces angry Mr Britt notices the
melancholy on his daughter’s face

INT FACSIMILE - MAIN OFFICE - EVENING

The tail end of the office party A banner pinned along the
wall reads CONGRATULATIONS DARIUS

Douchey guys surround Jeff laughing too loud

JEFF
Meanwhile she’s like “I want you to
fuck my ass” And I’m like “you’re
the kind of girl I might fall in
love with let’s take it slow”

Jeff notices Darius drift away from the group She passes a
COWORKER at a computer

COWORKER
Hey Darius there’s another parody
video about your mullet-man You
gotta see this it’s hilarious
Darius moves on ashamed to even acknowledge it

COWORKER (OS)
This guy’s a legend

Jeff catches up to her alone in the corner

JEFF
I had this made up for you

He hands her a glass framed print of her article

JEFF
Nice writing kid

Darius takes the frame then casts a guilty glance toward the
parody video on the computer

DARIUS
Jeff I never meant to--

JEFF
I know

Arnau approaches with a short INDIAN GIRL under his arm

ARNAU
Hey we’re cutting out early but
congrats

DARIUS

Thanks Arnau Bye
Arnau and Darius hug then he leaves with his woman

JEFF
Seriously great job I’m proud of you

She smiles Jeff leaves her She looks at the framed story
Her POV pans across the article We see the title
SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED

Photos of Kenneth that we saw earlier in his house are
patched in amongst the paragraphs

We see her face as she stops on one photo in particular

Kenneth age five before he ever was the butt of any joke
smiling with wide innocent eyes and just one ear

CUT TO BLACK
