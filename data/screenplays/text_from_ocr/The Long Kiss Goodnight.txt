Assaulted from without by SNOWFLAKES Wind tossed
INSIDE a bed dappled with moon shadow A LITTLE GIRL

The child subsides breathing steady Eyes closed The
rises Regards her through the dimness Slowly turns
for the door Flicks on a Winnie the Pooh NIGHTLIGHT --
Her entire right forearm is slicked with blood More
on her Czech-made MP-5 machine gun
She staggers just a little barely noticeable Passes

Waking is slow

Samantha opens her eyes Blinks Hazy out of focus

to rub her eyes cant Hands Somethings wrong what
helld she do with her hands Ah Theyre stretched
her head BOUND WITH CORD Suddenly shes very awake
ANOTHER ANGLE

The basement of the old converted mill A drafty

place full of old broken timbers A river runs through
A stream at any rate The waters are still and frozen
Above the stream -- A GREAT WOODEN WHEEL Smaller

of the wheel outside Mounted on the same axis
SAMANTHA is tied to that wheel Lashed to its SIDE

to it like a goddess to a Greek sailing ship Now the
news the ice has been chopped away so the wheel can
And it will plunge Samantha UNDER THE FREEZING WATER
the ice Bound hand and foot Strapped to the wheel
only a nightgown she is utterly helpless

THE MAN KNOWN AS DAEDALUS (AKA Luke) stands before her

instructions to the ubiquitous TIMOTHY He looks up at
Samantha Seeing her eyelids flutter he tosses her a

wave Gone is the gee-whiz country boy schtick in its
a frightening arrogance He tosses her his cheeriest
DAEDALUS

Well good afternoon If it isnt
the forgetful spy How you feeling
SAMANTHA
Not-so fresh

Samantha struggles against her bonds No dice
Subsides

Takes a look around at her predicament TIMOTHY stands
at

the edge of the ice Watching her intently Smiles
thinly

SAMANTHA
You youre the man from the
bar

TIMOTHY
Look at her Shes not faking it
she doesnt know me from Adam

Daedalus shakes his head frowning

DAEDALUS

Its not that I dont trust my
compatriot Colonel Baltimore In
fact I had every confidence that
your amnesia was genuine -- until
you showed up here You follow

Meanwhile I just got around to
reading the papers theres the small
matter of an incident upstate Long
range rifle shot blew a man out of
his socks

You can see where Im coming from
Im trying to pull of the biggest
job of my career I have to know
How much you really remember and
who youve told

SAMANTHA
I didnt tell a soul I swear

DAEDALUS
Well soon know

He crosses toward a large RED BUTTON Set into a wooden
beam

Samantha thrashes at the bindings Looks down at the
water

where it intercepts the mammoth wheel Fighting panic
SAMANTHA
Is is this a torture thing

DAEDALUS

Torture yes The torturing of
beautiful women albeit politically
incorrect is an addiction with me

(beat)
A woman never looks quite so beautiful
as when her face is distended in
pain Witness the beauty of
childbirth

SAMANTHA
Please Im getting all misty Look
untie me Ill make any face you

want
DAEDALUS
Lets not and say we did Do you
smoke
SAMANTHA
Smoke Um no Not not really

yourself and take a deep breath
Were gonna do the torture thing

TURNS

Feet first into the water Struggling Arms stretched
above

her
in the eye shakes his head

You dont remember at all The
greatest night of your life shit

unbridled HATRED He chuckles
DAEDALUS
Talk to me Colonel Is my identity
safe The truth and Ill shoot
you in the head Nice and quick
Otherwise youre in for a long night
Who did you talk to

killed See she didnt really
care that God had let someone die
just so long as it missed her

(beat)
and she bought her cross at the
same store as mine see thats what
we do we all pray to the same cross
on a hundred different walls and
sit back and wait to see who gets
hit and who gets missed

Anger flares in her eye Like a stirring of mud at the
bottom
of a deep deep pond

CHARLY

Fuck the waiting Fuck being afraid
I determine who gets hit and how
hard And I thank no one Its
pathetic to thank someone who spares
you -- when theyre just taking

TIMOTHY
Good to have you back again Chuck

PERKINS
You know Colonel you ought really
to have stayed dead You dont know
the rules of the game anymore

CHARLY
No shit Eight years ago you send
me to kill Daedalus and this clown
Now youre working with him

He crosses to the fireplace flips the match inside

PERKINS
Budget cuts remember Congress
blinded us in Eastern Europe Central
America Across the board an
intelligence blackout We had to
recruit any eyes and ears we could
find even if it meant going to former
targets

Pause Suddenly Charlys eyes go wide She whispers

CHARLY
Budget cuts oh God Is that
what this is about The foot
soldiers the tanker truck Fuck
me youre running a fundraiser

Comprehension dawning She looks up in disbelief

CHARLY
Youll get all the money you want at
the next budget hearing wont you
All you need is a major terrorist
incident

PERKINS
Interesting theory

CHARLY

Theory my ass I think some
terrorists were planning a strike
Bought supplies from Daedalus thats
how you knew they were coming

(eyes widening)
No way Dont tell me youre gonna
sit there and let them go through
with it just to get a budget
increase

Perkins shrugs philosophically

PERKINS
Its not without precedent 1993
remember the World Trade Center
bombing The CIA had advance
knowledge dont think they didnt
Worse the diplomat who issued the
terrorists visa was CIA they
facilitated the bombing Purely to
justify a budget increase Of course
theyd no way of knowing the
terrorists would botch the job

Thats not gonna happen this time
