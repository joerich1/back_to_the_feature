Dont you know you should never offer a newspaper man more than two dollars If you do
hell think its counterfeit I dont need fifty dollars As a matter of fact Ive got fifty dollars

Grayson is considerably disconcerted He tries again

somewhat uneasily at Mrs Schuyler as he presents the tray She glares blackly at Stew without

126 CLOSE SHOT - STEW

In bed asleep all curled up his head on his arm CAMERA TRUCKS BACK showing the
magnificent bedroom with carved wooden panellings a raised canopied bed The clothes that
Stew has taken off the night before are draped haphazardly about the room When the Camera
gets to a point that takes in a LONG SHOT of the room the door to the hall opens and a correctly
attired valet appears He closes the door noiselessly goes over to the windows and draws the
brocaded drapes aside Then he crosses to a covered object and with a small flourish removes
the cover - revealing a birdcage He approaches the bed

127 CLOSER SHOT

As Dawson the valet stops beside the bed The valet leans over and speaks distinctly

DAWSON
Mr Smith sir—
There is no movement from the form on the bed

DAWSON

Mr Smith sir

Still no response The valet taps the bedclothes-shrouded shoulder gently
DAWSON

Mr Smith sir—

Sleepily Stew turns his eyes heavy with sleep
128 MEDIUM SHOT

DAWSON

How do you like your bath sir

Stew peers up puzzled

STEW

Who are you

DAWSON

(surprised)

STEW

Youre my what

DAWSON

Your valet sir

Stew still stares at him Then he nods to himself - thinks he gets the idea Stew kicks back
the covers and sits on the edge of the bed in his pajamas Still sitting on the edge of the bed he
starts to slip his feet into a pair of slippers The valet bends on one knee to help him

STEW

Thank you thank you thank you Ill do that for you some time Thats very sweet Say
listen what did you say your name was

DAWSON

Dawson sir

STEW

Dawson huh Was I very drunk last night

DAWSON

Drunk sir

Stew rises and starts to reach for a dressing gown but again the valet beats him to it -
holding it for him and helping him slip into it

STEW

Yes I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet

DAWSON

Oh but you didnt engage me sir

Stew surprised turns on him quickly
STEW
Who did engage you then if I didnt engage you What are you doing with my pants—
The valet picks up his pants
STEW
Did you take anything out of those pants
DAWSON
Oh no sir
STEW
What are you doing fooling around in here
DAWSON
Miss Schuyler - I mean Mrs Smith - she engaged me this morning sir

Stew pulls out a cigarette The valet without missing a beat leans over and offers a light A
wary Stew accepts

STEW

Hmmm So Mrs Smith engaged me a valley huh Thats very nice of Mrs Smith - to
engage me a valley

129 WIDER SHOT
Stew walks over and gets a cigarette out of a box on a small table waving his hand in a gesture
of dismissal The valet is right behind him holding up his bathrobe for Stew to step into

STEW

(putting on the bathrobe)

Say you are nice Youre all right Youd make a good wife

DAWSON

Thank you sir

STEW

But not for me Though I like you well enough Youre a nice fellow Youre all right But Im
sorry I dont need any valleys today

The valet pays no attention to him but walks around the room picking up the clothes that
Stew has flung about

DAWSON

Oh but indeed you do sir if you dont mind my saying so A gentlemans gentleman as it
were Someone to draw your bath lay out your clothes help to dress you - its really most
essential sir

Stew with his cigarette between his lips stands watching the valet as he retrieves the
various articles of cast-off clothing The valets manner is somewhat patronizing He walks over
to a chifferobe and starts opening the drawers preparatory to laying out fresh things for Stew
Suddenly Stew stalks over to him takes him by the shoulder and yanks him around to face
him

130 CLOSER SHOT - STEW AND DAWSON
The valet is astonished and somewhat alarmed at the belligerent expression on Stews face
STEW
(over-sweetly)
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them
up
DAWSON
Quite so Quite
STEW
Now Im sorry I appreciate your efforts But I dont need anybody to help me button my

pants - Ive been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right and I can button em with one
hand as a matter of fact

DAWSON

Now Mr Smith now please—

Stew is rapidly losing his temper

STEW

Youve got a nice face Dawson you wouldnt want anything to happen to your face would

The valet puts a bewildered hand to his face

DAWSON

Oh no sir—

Stew releases him with a definite motion toward the door

STEW

DAWSON

(bewildered)

I beg your pardon sir

STEW

ravishing and revealing negligee She carries a small jewelers box in her hand She crosses the
room toward Stew

209 CLOSE TWO SHOT - ANNE AND STEW

STEW

Whats the idea Anne

ANNE

The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately
STEW

Now wait a minute Arent you being a little unreasonable

ANNE

Unreasonable Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs Do you expect me
to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom

STEW
Now wait dont get excited Anne Theres no reason for that Perhaps the boys have had a
little too much to drink Thats all right Im sorry Ill go right down and throw them out Thats
no reason for you to take this attitude After all I certainly have a right to invite a few of my
friends to my house havent I

ANNE

(pointedly)

STEW

(getting the implication after a pause)

O-o-oh I get you—

ANNE
Stewart
STEW
(hotly)

This is something I should have done a long time ago only I didnt have sense enough to
do it No I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn
well was a failure from the very beginning But no more No more So thats that

ANNE

You cant walk out of here like this

Throughout the scene Stew is gathering his things together—and probably packing an
overnight bag

STEW

Oh I cant Whos going to stop me Id like to see somebody stop me If you think Im
going to stick around this joint just to look at this mausoleum not on your life Youre going to
make no stuffed shirt out of me Now what do you think of that

Mrs Schuyler stalks majestically in

Gallaghers cry of joy is cut off by an icy look from Mrs Schuyler
GALLAGHER

Youve done nothing but watch me - watch me - ever since Ive been here Treated me like

He has his bag all packed by this time He snaps it shut viciously lifts it off the chair picks
up his hat and notices Mrs Schuyler staring open-mouthed at him

STEW
(to Mrs Schuyler pointedly)

—and heres some more news for you You can take your red room your green room your
left wing and your right wing and you know what you can do with them

I wouldnt worry too much about it Stew Shell see it your way

STEW
Huh

(snapping out of it)

Oh Im

Gallagher stares at him realizing he is thinking more about the play than his split-up with
his wife Then she breaks into a grin

GALLAGHER

Why youre just a first-class chump You just staged a scene that would play like a million
dollars How about that declaration of independence for the second act curtain

Stew stops stock still and stares at her

Thats an idea Gallagher - a great idea

Stew starts advancing nervously toward him Grayson a bit alarmed rises

STEW

(closing in on him)

Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack All right youve just made it Before

Dont think Let me do all the thinking Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell
them that I didnt marry that dame for her dough and I dont want any of her dough now I was

too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married so Im giving her a divorce for a
wedding present Now stand up

away

228 MED SHOT
Gallagher enters from the kitchen carrying a platter of ham and eggs and a coffee pot She sets
them on a small table and this is spread with a cloth Then she crosses over to Stew

GALLAGHER

(pretending ignorance)

STEW

(without looking up from his typing)
Grayson - Annes lawyer
GALLAGHER

What did he want

STEW

Gallagher that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act
They sit at the little table

229 CLOSER SHOT

GALLAGHER

What was the idea he gave you

Stew dives into the ham and eggs

STEW

Its a swell idea Gallagher Hows this The wifes family lawyer comes to see the kid see -
to talk over the divorce Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony -

so the kid gets sore socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out Hows that for the
beginning of the third act huh

GALLAGHER

Well from now on the play will be easy All you have to do is bring the wife back have her
say shes sorry and then your plays over

230 CLOSEUP - STEW
He looks over at Gallagher with a peculiar expression

STEW

(vehemently - as he scoops out some melon)

Whats the matter Do you think Im going to let that guy go back to his wife Not on your
life Hes got to go to the other girl

231 CLOSEUP - GALLAGHER
She almost drops her coffee cup in a wild gleam of hope as she looks back at him Gallagher tries
hard to keep her voice steady

GALLAGHER

(not sure of herself)
What other girl—

232 MED CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO

STEW

The little OBrien girl of course - the one you suggested in the story
GALLAGHER

(ecstatic but still fighting)

But thats ridiculous You cant make a sudden change like that
STEW

Gallagher what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play
GALLAGHER

No

STEW

Theres nothing sudden about that—

(tensely)

Hes always loved the girl but he was such a sap he didnt have sense enough to tell her
Well thats all right - we can fix that He will

go to the little OBrien girl and - here Ill show you
He gets to his feet and comes around to her

233 CLOSE TWO SHOT
Gallagher watches him a bit uncertainly

STEW
(tenderly)

He goes to the little OBrien gal and he says to her - in some pretty words of some kind -
something that you can write - hell say—

(as if reading part - very emotional)

Darling Im sorry Ive been a fool all my life Ive always loved you only I didnt have
sense enough to see it As quick as I can get a divorce from my wife I want you to marry me
Then shell look at him that way - yeah - then theyll embrace or something like that

(they draw closer)

Then hell kiss her or something

To demonstrate the point Stew takes her in his arms and kisses her They hold the kiss
longer than is justified Stew is swept away by his sudden emotion and clings to her desperately
while Gallaghers arms instinctively go around his neck

Gallagher chokes back tears that persist in coming She stifles a sob Stew folds her in his
arms

STEW

(tenderly)

Whats the matter Gallagher Whats the matter

Gallagher buries her face in his shoulders

FADE OUT

THE END
