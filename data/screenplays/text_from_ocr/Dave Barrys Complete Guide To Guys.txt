POV FROM ROOFTOP - THROUGH BINOCULARS - A FANTASTIC BLONDE
rinses off at an outdoor shower Beads of spray skip off
her like diamonds in the sunlight

STEARNS
Oh mama
She bends twists water streams down every delicious curve

LEOPOLD
She sure is taking her time

STEARNS
She must be really salty

these three models --

STEARNS

He WHIPS THE BINOCULARS back but all thats left is the
Chihuahua Then walking into the spot --

DAVE
Hi Im Dave Barry Has something
like this ever happened to you
(bends down to pet

THE CHIHUAHUA)
Because if youre a guy - or if you
know someone who is - then what youve
just seen should look pretty familiar
He picks up the Chihuahua starts walking with it

DAVE
Scientists call this condition Lust
Induced Brain Freeze It affects
millions of guys every day in all
walks of life -- causing anything
from a mild embarrassment to an
international incident
He stops Finds LEOPOLD and STEARNS and SEVERAL OTHER AGENTS
pointing GUNS at him

LEOPOLD
Hand over the dog

DAVE
Hey I didnt even know it was a
dog
They take it from him rush it away Dave turns to CAMERA

DAVE
Notice I didnt say its a condition
that affects men every day -- only
guys And that subtle but important
difference is one of the things this
movie is about

LENORE

(thinks about it)
-- The guys were funnier But the

waving Elaine over who cuddles into him

ROGER

Ive been thinking too Elaine And

to a lasting commitment I havent
said anything up until now because

that I not mislead you But yes
Elaine I want to think that we dQ
have a future And with a little
more time I think I could be sure

ELAINE
Oh Roger
He smiles Strokes her hair and pulls her in even closer
They share a long deep sigh together As the PICTURE FREEZES

So where did this all start Many
experts now think they know where
men came from but what about Guys
where did they come from
He stops peels off a THICK BOOK full of science things

DAVE
To answer this question accurately
we might have to look something up
So instead well travel back to
prehistoric sub-Saharan Africa and
get there just in time for the Dawn

PRIMATE GENE
How do you kill an animal with that

PRIMATE LOUIE
You throw it

PRIMATE LENNY
You mean you dont chase the old
ones until they get tired and then
hit them with the jagged rock slabs

PRIMATE PETE
(shakes his head)
You can stand in one place all day
And when they go by you just let
loose
He shows a throwing motion The first four look intrigued

PRIMATE LOUIE
You can carry more than one - and if
youre throwing uphill it rolls
back down if you miss Its so much
easier with these

PRIMATE GENE
-- Im sticking with mine
(then off their looks)
fires

Weve been using these jagged slabs

forever And you know why Because

they work And anyway killing them

is only half of it -- how are you

gonna skin a wildebeest with that

OS gather and go to the ridge where they SEE

POV FROM RIDGE --
The PRIMATE GUYS are coming back without their jagged slabs
and without any animals But they are having great fun

running in primitive patterns and throwing one of the ROCKS
back and forth and chasing whoever has it It looks like

the beginnings of rugby or Australian Rules Football in
terms of all they need now is beer

The PRIMATE WOMEN watch And trade looks Once more
something seems to pass between them

CUT TO
INT PRIMATE CAVE - NIGHT

Primate Roger and Primate Elaine try to keep it down for the

PRIMATE ELAINE
But you didnt kill anything

PRIMATE ROGER
Nobodys going with jagged slabs
anymore

PRIMATE ELAINE
But the kids are hungry

PRIMATE ROGER
What about your pounded roots

PRIMATE ELAINE
Pounded roots are a side dish They
need balance in their diets
(then off his look)
And another thing - suppose you do
start bringing animals home using
this -- whos going to skin and clean
them
He looks at her-the SOUND of TOMORROWS ROOSTER CROWING as

EXPLORER ELAINE

EXPLORER ROGER

BURGER KING KID
Then whatre you looking at

ROGER AT 8
Nothing
And they start punching again The Dad looks up - so
weary

DAVE

(AT COUNTER)
Here we can see where even at an
early age guy behavior is already
well developed along complex patterns
that social scientists have called
Jerks While girls at the same
age are referred to by the same social
scientists as human beings

ANGLE ON A TABLE FULL OF GIRLS - INCLUDING ELAINE AT AGE 8

They are all chatting nicely passing out napkins and
ketchup

packets making sure everyone has what they need While the

MOTHER that brought them quietly reads a novel

INT NOTED PEDIATRICIANS OFFICE - DAY
Dave sits across from a BRITISH GUY with a SUBTITLE saying

Noted Pediatrician He has a laser pointer and a
powerpoint presentation

DAVE
Where are we in the area of Guy
Violence Doctor

SCIENTIFIC EXPERT
Well first one must understand the
inherent differences in DNA and cell
structure as relates to men and women

(CLICKING SLIDES)
For example all women have a gene
that makes them have the need for
meaningful conversations Likewise
all men have a gene in them that we
scientists believe is directly related
to violence

DAVE
And what can be done about that

SCIENTIFIC EXPERT
well some of my esteemed colleagues
are quite keen on the idea of
tampering with the DNA itself - an
idea with which I heartily disagree
The bastards

DAVE
Then what would you recommend

SCIENTIFIC EXPERT
Me Well they can start by spreading
out the funding a little bit Let a
few other scientists wet their beaks
I mean whats the point of rewarding
the same tired old hacks year after

YEAR --

DAVE
I meant about Guy Violence

SCIENTIFIC EXPERT

OH --
(then shifting back)
Well nothing really I mean what
can you do Short of lobotomizing
them anyway No I suppose well
just have to continue to channel
their aggression into socially
acceptable outlets Like professional
wrestling or the space program
DAVE
I see Can I ask you a question

SCIENTIFIC EXPERT
Certainly

DAVE
Whered you get that laser pointer

SCIENTIFIC EXPERT
Its mine

A lot of work has been done in the

DAVE
So when we see guys like Ed and his
fireworks - or guys shooting marine

flares into innocent pumpkins or

pointless juvenile activities

each other at this level of intimacy
Are we heading toward marriage

OLD MAN
November 8 1960 The day John
Kennedy beat Nixon and won the White
House That was the day I met her
His WIFE turns looks at him funny

OLD MAN
It was close the whole way - it was
neck and neck by God But then old
Kennedy Senior rode on in on that
big old pile of money of his and
fixed the results in Illinois And
that made all the difference
Happiest day of my life just about
She watches him The man is hopeless

OLD MAN
I was walking away from a newspaper
stand with my head buried in the
final edition And I looked up and
there she was
(he looks over at his

WIFE)
You were wearing a yellow sun dress
and there was a smudge of makeup
just over your left eye
He smiles at her Gets a thin smile back

OLD MAN
What

OLD LADY
That wasnt me

OLD MAN

Of course it was you What are you
talking about

OLD LADY
It was your first wife

OLD MAN
Nonsense

OLD LADY

We met in Sacramento Eight anda
half years ago

OLD MAN
Dont believe her

OLD LADY
Ive never owned a yellow sun dress
in my life And even if I did I
wouldnt be wearing it in November

OLD MAN
(off her look)
-- The point is in 1960 an Irish
Catholic could be elected president
of this fine country as long as his
father was a filthy rich rum-runner
with connections to the Mafia And

to quit

ELAINE
They dont know the players The
players dont know them - yet they

Dave
idolize these people They follow
them from team to team -- and they
know more about these teams than
they know about their own families
They might not even know if they
have families

KELLY
Not during the playoffs anyway

ELAINE
(amen to that then)
And what gets me is they think -
they really think - that whether a
team wins or loses or not depends on
how much they personally care about
them Like if they dont care the
team cant win

DAVE
But thats true
They look over - see him on the counter

ELAINE
Whats true

DAVE
Its true that the level of concern
a guy shows for his team can affect
the outcome of the game
(then off their looks)
I mean not just one guy - but lots
of guys All the guys who care about
the team combined if they really
care can make a difference on the
scoreboard

Thats crazy

The PICTURE CHANGES as though a filter has been slipped over

join the combined Concern Rays of
all the other guy fans watching this

words Leading Social Scientist APPEAR under him this time

LEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST

One has to understand that the act
of emptying ones bladder goes deep
to the very roots of masculinity

It is an important territorial
statement that males are genetically
programmed to carry out

DAVE
I see

LEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST

In fact many of my colleagues believe
the reason that dogs howl at the

moon is because they cant go up

there and urinate on it -- which is
not however a theory which I

embrace But guess who gets all the
grant money every year The

bastards

He stares off into space A bitter man

DAVE
Umyou were saying

LEADING SOCIAL SCIENTIST

I didnt want this job Twenty years
in the social sciences And what

was everybody else doing -- they
were getting laid They were going
to bed with women And what have I
been doing -- applying for matching

legendary coach of footballs Oakland
Raiders and veteran network analyst
for CBS Sports and now the Fox Sports
Network John thanks for coming by
today

JOHN MADDEN
Happy to be here Dave

DAVE
John you heard what our leading
expert said about this particular
anxiety that guys have regarding
bathrooms in general and public ones
in particular Any thoughts

JOHN MADDEN
Well hes exactly right Dave I
mean the guy was a little loopy but
he hit the nail on the head

DAVE
So an airport bathroom presents a
specific kind of challenge

JOHN MADDEN
The worst kind Dave and in a lotta
ways Because a guys main goal is
to get in and outta there without
having to deal in any other way with
any other guy - and in an airport
bathroom especially with the turnover
rate theyve got hes up against
some pretty mean odds

DAVE
Couldnt agree more John Lets go

Heres our first candidate now --

INTERCUT WITH

John diagrams the action marking up the screen like a
football play while the action unfolds

JOHN MADDEN
Okay now the leadoff guy hes gonna
come in hes gonna see the open
field and hes gonna swing wide right
to grab a spot against the wall
Hes got one flank covered this way
and for now hes feelin pretty good --
and of course by doin that hes
also settin the tone for everything
that happens after

ra€c 68

DAVE
Whats the main thing were looking
for John What does each individual
guy feel he needs to get out of this

JOHN MADDEN
Well the crucial thing here is makin
sure theres no eye contact I mean
none - zero These guysll look up
theyll look down theyll look
straight ahead -- but a guy would
rather have you poke both his eyes
out with burning hot fire tongs
Dave than to give the next guy over
a reason to think you might be lookin
at him in a public bathroom For
reasons that oughtta be pretty darn
obvious

DAVE
Obvious indeed Now here comes Guy
Number Two --
The SECOND GUY comes in John diagrams the call

JOHN MADDEN
Now Guy Number Two what hes gonna
do is hes gonna come in see the
first guy in position along the wall

and right away hes gonna line up

wide on the opposite side This is

a best case scenario here something

both these guys can appreciate

Plus theyve opened up the middle

for the third guy --

The THIRD GUY comes in John diagrams his path to the middle
urinal The Guy goes there

DAVE
What about eye contact in this
situation

JOHN MADDEN
Well youre still not likely to
encounter any but again if you do
thats what that buffer zone on either
side of hims for And all three of
em are feelin pretty lucky to have
it I can tell you that

DAVE
Okay Now if things stay like this

JOHN MADDEN
If things stay like this youre
fine - and if this were some small
commuter airport yknow late at
night or somethin then these guys
could possibly even be home free
But were talkin Miami International
here this is the big time were
talking about 747s DC-10s the
big jumbo jets dumpin off three-
four hundred people at a clip So
everybodys gonna be next to somebody
which is the last thing any of these
guys want Youre in a critical
mass Situation and this is where a
lotta mistakes get made
DAVE
Which brings us to Guy Number Four
Here he comes --

JOHN MADDEN
-- and there he goes
Guy 4 spins around and leaves John and Dave watch

DAVE
Now one thing that I know were going
to get asked John especially from
women is whether as guys were
aware of how utterly stupid this
kind of behavior really is

JOHN MADDEN
Well I think we know Dave Dont

Oh - yeah hi

(ACKNOWLEDGES CAMERA

hen to Dave)

ell the baseball thing I mean a

ou know fooling around with
ifferent lineups mixing up the
atting order - like thinking about
what would happen if you took your
cleanup guy and made him eighth or
something -- just something stupid
like that you know Stuff youd
never really do

OAK Zac

DAVE
And that did the trick

Oh hell yeah I mean I could go all
night - literally all night - just
shuffling my pitching staff around
or thinking about who I might try
and sign at the winter meetings
Hang on --

sex or baseball that much And you
dont want to mess with that stuff

They are so Ice Age

CUT TO
INT PRIMATE ROGER AND PRIMATE ELAINES CAVE - NIGHT

Primate Roger watches Primate Elaine examine his NEW ROCK
Her PRIMATE MOM AND DAD hover on the edge of the discussion

PRIMATE ELAINE
I dont get it What was wrong with
the other one

PRIMATE ROGER
This ones better Its an upgrade

PRIMATE ELAINES FATHER

PRIMATE ROGER
An upgrade An improvement on a
previous design

PRIMATE ELAINES MOTHER
What Whatd he say

PRIMATE ELAINES FATHER
(to his wife)
An upgrade An grade

PRIMATE ROGER
(to Primate Elaine)
The guy said there are newer ones

one look primitive Theyre getting
lighter and rounder every epoch

PRIMATE ELAINES FATHER

PRIMATE ROGER
Primate Discount Manny

PRIMATE ELAINES FATHER

(MUTTERS )
Boy he must have seen this one
coming

PRIMATE ELAINE
Dad

(then to Primate Roger)

I just wanted to know what the
difference is between this one and
the one you had You were so excited
about it when you got it and now
youve gotten rid of it -- and the
only difference I can see is where
this one has these markings painted
on
She holds it up something like BASEBALL SEAMS going around

PRIMATE ROGER
Those make it so it travels better

PRIMATE ELAINE
Painted on
(off his look)
-- Whatd it cost you

PRIMATE ROGER
Nothing A couple wildebeeste steaks
and handful of seeds of some kind

PRIMATE ELAINES FATHER

PRIMATE ROGER

PRIMATE ELAINE

PRIMATE ELAINES MOTHER

(to Primate Roger)

I dont mean to meddle But you
should listen to your wife

PRIMATE ELAINES FATHER
Thats meddling Thats meddling
(then to Primate Roger)
-- But in this case shes right

PRIMATE ELAINE
(to her parents)

PRIMATE ROGER

(THEN)

in SLOW MOTION FROM SEVERAL ANGLES the way they do it when
buildings explode in much bigger movies

PRIMATE ROGER

EXT MIAMI BAYSIDE COMPLEX - DAY

Dave strolls among the SHOPPERS TOURISTS etc He has the
ROCK with him tosses it unconsciously like a baseball

DAVE
This is basically where we stand
today The only difference is we
have way more standards
(gives the ROCK to a
KID passing by)
There are social standards about
being sensitive - remembering
anniversaries listening during
conversations not eating soup with
your hands or sitting around in
your underwear when companys over

CUT TO
INT DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

Dave goes up the escalator walks through the kind of Home
Stylings section where no other guy would go Everything
he talks about is on display in some form

DAVE
-- And there are thousands of
standards for domestic life involving
even more totally un-guy concepts --
like curtains bedspreads napkins
special hangers little soaps shaped
like fruit and decorative boxes
that hold tissues that already come
in a box While guys left on their
own in the wild will develop
lifestyles that dont involve any of
these things

CUT TO
INT COLLEGE GUY APARTMENT - DAY

COLLEGE ROGER and COLLEGE GENE stand in their doorway There
is one window a lot of dust and nothing else

COLLEGE GENE
I know just what this place needs

COLLEGE ROGER

(NODS)
Hockey sticks
They turn around to go buy hockey sticks

Cut TO

INT THE SAME APARTMENT - SOME MONTHS LATER

A RABBIT on a lawn chair drinks beer out of an ashtray
College Roger and College Gene play Indoor Death Hockey
slamming into walls scattering NEWSPAPERS and PIZZA BOXES -
as their IMAGE FREEZES

DAVE
of course even by the most basic
standards these two are living like
savages But they honestly dont
know this -- because Guys in their
natural state arent any more aware
of domestic standards than a trout
would be aware of the stock market
And this causes women a lot of
concern

Cut TO

EXT SEATTLE - E-CAFE - DAY

SEATTLE GIRL
Take laundry To him his clean
clothes are ready when hes ready to
go get them And they can dry the
rest of the way in the drawer But
they dont dry the rest of the way
in the drawer they sit there in
damp musty unfolded balls and he
doesnt even mind and I cant figure
that out What is the matter with
folding something What is the matter
with waiting for it to be dry

CUT TO
INT DAVES CURRENT BEDROOM - DAY

Dave unloads a laundry basket on the bed Starts folding
the clean clothes and making piles

DAVE

Laundrys a big issue - and a deep
and puzzling mystery to guys My
own wife Michelle for instance is
an accomplished sportswriter and
mother of an extremely young child
yet she is still able to maintain a
vigorous clothes-cleaning regimen
bordering on the super-human And
Im not allowed near the stuff

MICHELLE
(comes in with more
CLOTHES)
Hes right
She dumps out the clothes sees what hes doing and takes
over doing it better Dave picks up a random BLOUSE shows
a LABEL with lots of printing on it

DAVE
These are clearly secret codes that
women intuitively understand but
cannot adequately explain -- just
like how a lot of guys understand
the Infield Fly Rule without being
able to explain that

MICHELLE
I can explain the Infield Fly Rule

DAVE
Because youre special Sweetheart

TITLE CARD GUY BASHING
EXT OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY

Dave anchors a semi circle with Sidra Mia Karla E and
Lila
They take turns focus group style

SIDRA
Sometimes I think theyre just like
tapeworms You know I mean
tapeworms are just tapeworms - thats
all they are and all theyll ever
be Theyre just these repulsive
little parasitic beasts and nobody
expects anything different from them -
because people know thats their
nature And its the same way with
guys - although a tapeworms more
likely to help clean out the garage

LILA

(NODS)
They have to be the biggest and they
have to be the best And they can
never back down from a challenge
Ever

KARLA E
They sleep with your sister and wonder
whats wrong with that

MIA
They will make a game out of anything
A contest out of anything Give
them a grain of sand and they will
figure out some game with it

LILA
And theyll argue over the rules

KARLA E
(off their agreement)
They leave their dirty dishes
everywhere I cant believe the
places Ill find some crusted over
cereal bowl with yuckola blobs of
God knows what in them And the
thing is from his point of view
They really do get cleaned by magic
Because I cant take seeing them sit
there so I clean them

SIDRA
(to Karla E)
I just get him to wash my car when
that stuff happens

KARLA E
Sweetheart he could wash my car with
his tongue and it still wouldnt
make up for where I find those dishes
sometimes

DAVE
(while they commiserate)
So now that weve heard your thoughts
The frustration the exasperation
the obvious question comes to mind
Why go through it Why have guys in
your life at all
They look at him

MIA
-- You mean as a choice You mean
like a mature adult choice to have a
guy in your life In spite of
everything

SIDRA
Like trying to borrow money from
you after youve broken up so he
can buy something for his new
girlfriend And wondering what the
problem was with that I mean like
really not knowing
Dave looks at her They all do Until --

LILA
Ill tell you why There is no good
reason thats why
The others turn look her way

LILA
-- I mean dont get me wrong They
really can be fun You know like a
big stupid dog can be fun I mean
not everything has to be so serious
in life You want to be able to do
more with someone than just read
book reviews together - which is
something a guy would never do anyway
(then as the others

LISTEN CLOSER)
But what a guy will do Is at eleven
oclock at night hell show up at
your door and bring cheese steaks
And he doesnt care that you look
all rumply and dreadful from not
expecting anyone He might not even
remember that youre a vegetarian
and dont eat cheese steaks -- but
that doesnt really matter either
Because the point is he wanted one
and he cant come out and say it but
he didnt want to eat it alone

MIA
And youre the person he thought of

LILA
(off her look nods)
I cant tell you what that feels
like when they do that
(a beat and then)
I swear if they knew how adorable
they are sometimes theyd be
dangerous I mean -- more dangerous
The other Girls think about that Considering

SIDRA
-- Bullshit Theyre tapeworms
The rest of them agree and all high-five her Dave leans
back from the fray turns to the CAMERA

DAVE
I think its time for the conclusion
now

TITLE CARD THE CONCLUSION
EXT JOHNNY LAKES HANG GLIDING CENTER - DAY

A SIGN says UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT Dave is on top of the
hill in a rig that the EX-LAWYER is fastening him into

DAVE
Well now you know where things stand
Youve learned a little bit about
guys and the critical roles theyve
played in the past and in modern
society today And for better or
worse theyre here with us to stay --
so the best thing you can do about
it is continue to learn about them -
by coming to see this movie lots and
lots of times and bringing more and
more of your friends back every time
you do Because the more people

that understand guys the better for
everyone And the more people that --
