CUT TO
INT NEWMEAT BUS

The SCREEN is mostly black but we see out through the meshed
rear windows a desolate panorama of gnarled trees and grubby
landscape bleak and hopeless

Now we HEAR outside the barking and baying of bloodhounds

not like theyre tracking but just playing as the truck

turns and stops The BUS GUARD and DRIVER get out The back

of the truck is opened by the guard and through that rectangle
of bright sunlight the silhouettes of the Newmeat descend
Luke last

EXT PRISON CAMP LUKES POV (DAY)

The Scene in a hollow is a long barracks white-washed
faded gray one story high At right is a mess hall and
laundry A chain-link fence surrounds the whole compound

The corners of the fence are telephone poles with floodlights
on the tops These burn all night Back of the mess hall
again outside the fence are several kennel runs in which
bloodhounds are now ROARING A wooden tower with a simple
board roof stands at two corners of the compound where the
guards sit when the prisoners are not locked in the barracks
A picnic table sits in a grassy area just outside and at one
side of the gate is a picket fence enclosing a scrubby lawn

BOSS PAUL
Four Right

He hands the papers to the CAPTAIN a small man with a kindly
face but a firm set mouth who always carries a golf club
In bg the bloodhounds are YOWLING

BOSS PAUL
Dogboy get them dogs shut up

DOGBOY a trustee whose leather gloves are always sticking
out of one back pocket puts his hand to be licked by the
dogs who quiet friendly like any pets

DOGBOY

The Captain has been ignoring this watching the prisoners
looking at their records
EXT NEWMEAT BUS (DAY)

as the Bosses (BOSS PAUL and BOSS HIGGINS) motion for them
the other Newmeat (to be known as TRAMP ALIBI and TATTOO)
stumble into each other and jostle Luke in their eagerness
to obey orders

BOSS PAUL

The Newmeat jostle into line They are wearing State Issue
gray pants and their own Free World shirts All except Luke
carry a paper bag or cigar box containing their wordly goods
All except Luke look apprehensive worried Luke stands with
languid grace neither insolent nor hostile nor fearful

him

CLOSE SHOT BLOODHOUND

INT BARRACKS (DAY)

Bare unpainted wood The windows are barred and covered

with chain link The door from the barracks up to the compound
passes a small area enclosed by a woven metal strap cage In
this usually sits the WICKER MAN whom we generally see as a
heavy short shape moving about his own business which is
making an endless series of rings or jewelry by hammering
coins with the back of a heavy spoon

The door to the barracks locks by the tongue of a strap iron
bar that is thrust through a hole in the wicker where the
Wicker Man locks it by padlock Thus he can always see them
but they cant reach him The single big room is filled with
two and even three-tiered bunks Bare bulbs hang from the
ceiling

CARR the floorwalker a 240 pound behemoth is indoctrinating
the Newmeat while they change into camp clothing gray twill
trousers shirt and jacket all numbered which has been
piled on the table Carr squeegees up and down a restless
man and CAMERA in following him SHOWS us the room At the
same time the Wicker Man is moving about the barracks
tapping the floors and bunk posts with a broom handle for
signs of tampering Carr pays no attention to him addressing
the Newmeat

CARR

Them clothes has got laundry numbers
on tem You remember your number and
always wear the ones that has your
number Any man forgets his number
spends a night in the box

(passing out spoons)
This yere spoon you keep with you
and any man loses his spoon spends a
night in the box There is no playing
grabass or fighting in the building
You got a grudge against another man
you can fight him Saturday afternoon
Any man playing grabass or fighting

in the building spends a night in

the box First bell is at five minutes
of eight when you will get in your
bunk and last bell is at eight

OS now are heard the SOUNDS of trucks arriving and the
Wicker Man goes back to the wicker

CARR

(continuing)
Any man not in his bunk at eight
will spend a night in the box There
is no smoking in prone position in
bed To smoke you must have both
legs over the side of your bunk
Anyone caught smoking in prone
position will spend a night in the
box You get two sheets Every
Saturday you put the clean sheet on
the top the top sheet on the bottom
and the bottom sheet you turn in to
the Laundry Boy Any man who turns
in the wrong sheet spends a night in
the box No one will sit on the bunks
with dirty pants on Any man sitting
on a bunk with dirty pants will spend
a night in the box Any man who dont
bring back his empty pop bottles
spends a night in the box

OS now are the SOUNDS of men counting off filling the air
with the apprehension of impending arrival

CARR

(continuing)
Any man loudtalking spends a night
in the box You got questions you
come to me

(attentive now)
Im Carr the floorwalker Im
responsible for order in here and
any man that dont keep order

Luke mouths the next line with him At the same time we
HEAR the clanking of the Wicker Mans doors opening and the
thudding of many steps

CARR
spends a night in the box
(to Luke sincerely)
I hope you aint gonna be a hardcase
NEW ANGLE

As Luke shrugs the chute bursts open and the Bull Gang rushes
in men trying to get hands clean urinate and get back out
into the chowline Sudden LOUD CHAOS The Newmeat are seated
on the bench bewildered except Luke who grins Koko spies
the Newmeat and is unhappy that there are only four

The Newmeat stampede out the chute
INT MESS HALL (DUSK)

Most of the other men already have their food and are sitting
down with no jockeying for places everybody knows They are
shoveling it down as fast as they can getting back up for
seconds Luke and the other Newmeat get their plates and
while the others stand there confused Luke sits at the
first vacant spot and begins to eat industriously

in chowlines

Tramp makes terrified and ineffectual efforts to scoop the
stew back onto his plate with his hand wiping his hand on
his uniform etc then trying to obliterate the stain on
the floor with a foot

INT THE TRUCK (AFTERNOON)

as it is opened from the outside Tramp sits up against the
bench still in rocky shape from his collapse The others
step over him as though he werent there Luke appears like
a sleepwalker He grabs the side rails gets one foot up and
tries to pull himself over the edge of the truck body But
the muscles are just used up Boss Paul sees this and gives
Luke a kick timed so that it coincides with his jump It
gives him just the added momentum needed to send him over
the edge of the body and sprawling along the floor Hes the
last one and as the guards lock them up he grins up at
Dragline and Gambler from his prone position
LUKE
(to Dragline)

EXT PRISON YARD LATE (AFTERNOON)

as they are counting in through the gate their hats with
their personal possessions in them held out to be inspected
their pockets turned out A guard frisks them quickly but
efficiently The Captain stands nearby ignoring them testing
a golf swing The men move to the mess hall most of them on
the run Luke moves painfully with exhaustion Alibi seems
quiet and cowed lost in the crowd They fall into a line at
the mess hall door Dynamite his spoon out moves to the
front of the line and Luke winds up somewhere near the rear

BOSS HIGGINS
(yardman)
Awright you Gibson step out Boss

Alibi looks around fearfully steps out peering up and down
the line wondering

BOSS HIGGINS
Get them clothes off

Alibi is led to the box A light stands about it shining
down into it and it always burns when the box is ready to be
used or when theres someone inside Now a nightshirt is
laid out on top of it Alibi strips and puts on the pajamas
Boss Kean opens the heavy lid of the box and we see it is
grilled with heavy chain link fencing and with strap iron
bars A chamber pot is put inside Alibi stands in the box
looking back at them then lies down out of sight The lid
is slammed shut

He is tanned and hardened now and has mastered the work
rhythm SHOT WIDENS to show Dragline near him checking his
shovel for nicks but really eyeballing a passing car In the
ditch Luke expertly scoops up a shovel full of sand and
levering the handle on his knee flips the sand through the
air so it hits spang in the pan of Draglines shovel while
Dragline is still eyeballing It knocks him off balance and
by the time he has caught up Luke is already catching him
with another shovel full

DRAGLINE
Slow down man They aint passing
out medals for slinging dirt

LUKE
I thought you knew boy they
sentenced me by the mile

Dragline grins at this insouciance sneaks a look down the

sunglasses which he holds up

showing Dragline similarly dressed They are squared off in
the yard surrounded by YELLING men who want blood It is a
release from the sexual tension built up by the night before
The guards stand in the guard boxes watching The Captain
sits up on his porch so he can see without being too obvious

Luke gets up and manages a lunging right across to Draglines
Adams apple Dragline is momentarily staggered but counters
with a terrible clubbing blow that mashes Lukes gloves into
his face knocking him to the ground Time is called for the

Luke instantly appears to

recover and walks casually back to the table It should be
clear this last was a little put-on between him and Dragline

to milk the last money into bets

LUKE

Luke sits and begins eating

cool confident but as the egg is crushed in his mouth the
first real gagging feeling of total surfeit hits him His

jaw closes and freezes His eyes grow desperate and swivel
toward Dragline though he doesnt dare move his head lest

he give way to nausea

him close to where Godfreys cane still stands in the sand

out of the sand and holds it out to Godfrey

Most of them are concentrated in front of Lukes bunk singing
and screaming trying to make as much noise as possible
Tattoo is reading a new sex book aloud while Dynamite
Loudmouth Steve others listen intently some avid some
confused

TATTOO

(reading)
Wanda trembled faced by this awesome
decision It was the moment of choice
Could she take the plunge and wantonly
hurl herself into pagan abandon Or
would she remain ever fettered by
the bonds of her puritanical
upbringing Could she take this chance
to experience the sensual thrill of
total release and gratification Or
would she turn her back and retreat
into frigid denial Desire and fear
temptation and terror yearning and
horror warred within her beautiful
young body

Luke is not to be seen among the music-makers and revellers
Moving through the crowd the CAMERA FINDS Luke on his hands
and knees sawing at the floorboard with a piece of hacksaw

ANGLE ON CARR

as the tire iron SOUNDS and SOUNDS again to be heard over
the din

Blind Dick and Chief who are trying to act out the
description tying themselves into an intricate anatomical
knot

DRAGLINE

She moved her head another inch while
he reached up and put his left hand
on Carols cheek as Carol pressed
her lips to Oh Lord I cant read

Carrs attention Stupid Blondie Rabbit and Chief are still
trying to untie themselves

hand and Boss Paul lays the blackjack in it As the chain
guards finish and stand up trembling with rage the Captain
takes a convulsive step forward and brings the sap down behind
Lukes ear As Luke tumbles down the littered embankment
toward the men

CAPTAIN
Dont you never talk that way to me

His rage subsides and his voice becomes calm reasonable

communicate Some men you cant reach

you talk reasonable so you get what
we had here last week which is the
way he wants it well he gets it

INT MESS HALL (NIGHT)

The men file in from work sullen and quiet Dogboy serving
but without his usual chatter Higgins leans back unusually
alert
ANGLE ON DOORWAY

Suddenly Luke appears unshaven but cleaned up and in his
uniform The men make room as he moves to his accustomed
place at the head of the line before Dynamite

DOGBOY

Hes heaping food onto Lukes plate

DOGBOY
(continuing)
Now you know the rules gotta eat

Higgins nods Dogboy continues to pile it on When Luke tries
to move on Dogboy reaches out and grabs the plate with his
free hand and continues to ladle it out Behind Dogboy Jabo
the cook looks sympathetic to Luke

JABO
(to Dogboy)

DOGBOY

(piling it on)

Luke looks at the impossibly piled plate and moves off
LUKE AT A TABLE

He is eating with great difficulty finally puts his spoon
down and his eyes close with weariness Koko reaches over
and takes a bite off the plate Luke sits there and one by
one the men get up and file out each one passing behind
Luke and taking a bite until as Deacon takes the last
mouthful the plate is empty and Luke stands up and leaves

EXT CAMP YARD (DAY)
It is Saturday afternoon The men have just returned from

He canes Luke on the back of the legs Luke falls and rolls
over and Paul canes him across the head Luke gets up on all
fours and makes a rush right at Boss Paul He is so weak and
uncoordinated that the attack does nothing but smear blood
and dirt over Pauls uniform The guards beat Luke away and
he falls on his back in the soft dirt

INT BARRACKS (NIGHT)

The men are restless their efforts to ignore whats happening
are futile Dragline gets up and looks out the window into
the yard Koko leans over beside him He holds the picture

full of dirt and hasnt the strength to move the shovel
Momentarily he stops moving and is hit We HEAR the thud
and the groan he gives

INT BARRACKS (NIGHT)

Luke slowly struggles to his feet and begins painfully
stumbling toward the barracks

as the chute opens and Luke staggers inside and the door is
slammed behind him

LUKE

He stumbles toward his bunk passing Tattoo and Alibi who
turn away embarrassed

bunk)

THE GROUP

as Luke walks back through them carrying the turtle

BOSS PAUL

He moves off toward the trucks with the turtle and we HOLD
on the disappointed reactions of the men featuring Dragline

Then there is the SOUND of a motor starting

ON THE GROUP NEW ANGLE
as they turn to look as one man

THE TRUCK

as Luke tries to get it in gear there is the SOUND of gears
grinding and as the truck begins to move the bed of the dump
body begins to raise The truck begins to move past the
prisoners away from the guards

ON THE GUARDS

As they begin to run toward the truck raising their guns
ON DRAGLINE

on his feet

DRAGLINE

the dump body

Dragline running alongside trying to grab the door handle
Inside Luke grinning fiercely as he drives SHOTS sounding

glasses the Man With No Eyes watching them denying
Draglines words

LONG DISSOLVE
EXT PALMETTO SWAMP

Dragline is exuberantly hacking away at palm fronds to cover
the truck while Luke is filing away at his chains

DRAGLINE

He tosses the severed chain link into the swamp and starts
to walk off Dragline hurrying behind him

EXT NEAR NEGRO VILLAGE (DUSK)

INT CHURCH
Luke mounts the steps of the lectern looks up

LUKE

Old Man What do I do now Awright
On my hands and knees a skin Yeah

way out myself

We HEAR the SOUND of vehicles outside telling Luke that the
police have arrived He starts for the back just as Dragline
enters from the side entrance Seeing him Luke looks up at
the ceiling

LUKE

a hardcase too aint you

DRAGLINE

He sees Luke moving toward the window

DRAGLINE
Luke what are do doin

OMITTED
ANGLE BY WINDOW
as Luke steps out of pitch black into the harsh light in

full view calm slight smile having chosen his moment His
voice is loud clear mocking
LUKE
WHAT WE GOT HERE IS A FAILURE TO
COMMUNICATE

A SHOT It catches Luke in the throat and throws him back
but he stays in the light still smiling

DRAGLINE
Luke

EXT CHURCHYARD (NIGHT)

ON guards and police FEATURING Godfrey who holds his smoking
rifle There are confused SHOUTS and movements by the
sheriffs but the Captain and the prison guards only look
toward Godfrey then turn away stoic

INT CHURCH

as Luke falls to one knee trying to hold himself up Dragline
is by his side helps him up and to the door

EXT CHURCHYARD (NIGHT)

where Bosses Kean and Paul move in to handcuff Luke Dragline
seeing Godfrey bellows out an INCOHERENT ROAR and charges
past the surprised guards to knock Godfrey to the ground

tear his glasses from him Confused bewildered Godfrey
gropes for the glasses as the prison guards beat Dragline
into submission

ANGLE ON CHURCH (PRE-DAWN) (NIGHT)

as Luke handcuffed behind his back is being led toward the
Captains car by Bosses Paul and Kean He is half-paralyzed
blood pouring from him The Captain has turned his back on
Godfrey talking to the Sheriff

SHERIFF
You follow me and Ill radio the
emergency clinic to open up

CAPTAIN
Im takin him to the prison hospital

SHERIFF
But thats an hour away He aint

CAPTAIN

MOVING SHOT LUKE

as he is brought past Dragline who is being held by several
guards Tears stream down Draglines cheeks Luke looks at
him still smiling as he is pushed into the Captains car
LUKE INT THE CAR

as it begins to move out In the bg across the road we SEE
the Negro villagers watching silently The window of the
car is up and the reflections on the glass make Luke already
dim a little distant

MOVING SHOT THE CAR (DAWN)

as it moves down the road over the trestle It is the mystic
hour of dawn the suns rays just diffusing as we watch the
car until it disappears over the rise in the road

EXT ROAD CLOSE ON YOYO (DAY)

The yoyo is swinging in the sun As the shot WIDENS we SEE
it is Dragline wearing chains wielding the yoyo and now we
SEE the others working around him Godfrey is gone Boss
Paul is now the Walking Boss The MUSIC gains strength and
speeds as

Dragline works with strong certain grace and determination
and the others also seem more vital and free as imperceptibly
the CAMERA PULLS BACK and RISES SLOWLY TO

HELICOPTER SHOT

as the men grow smaller in the limitless field of gold
stretching in all directions as far as the eye can see
intersected by four roads that reach out to infinity Now
the men are specks now invisible in the fields and there
are only the roads lines in the gold going on forever
OVER THIS SUPERIMPOSE the PICTURE OF LUKE now scotch-taped
together HOLD and

FADE OUT

THE END
