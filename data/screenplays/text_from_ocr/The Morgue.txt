One day youre going to make the headlines and it wouldnt be a
story youd have to chase cause the story will be you

One of the students rushes the DJs booth

Girl

Who wants these (grabbing at her voluptuous breast)

Girl climbs DJ booth and stands overlooking the crowd The crowd
goes wild She pulls her sweater over her head and swirls it

CUT TO

One of the security guards reaches for the girl she evades his
grip he urges her on to step down from the ledge of the DJs
booth He smiles and tells her to come down she looks at him and
points to her ears as though to say that she cannot hear him

Guard1
OK enough of this crap

He reaches up for the girl and he violently brings her down

Crowd
Boo you jackass

scrambling to get herself together

Romuald

Randy looks at Nanette and shrugs his shoulders She is in
disbelief and stomps off He tries to stop her but turns around to

Romuald
Hey you want to let her go

Guard1

Romuald(pulling guard by the shoulder)

Hey I said get your hands off her you dumb fuck cant you see youre

The guard turns around and slams the kid against the wall in retaliation
Romuald puts his index finger in the bottle and bashes it against the guards
head

FIGHT

Students and locals break out in a fight The club security converged
towards

the scene Romuald is the first person caught The security guards wrestled
him to the ground The guard that he had bashed on the head is bleeding He
swings at Romuald

Romi is out cold

Guard1(leaning over Romi with bottle)

You wanna be all bad dont you Well let me give you something to think
about

for Christmas you bloody wanker

Before he can deliver the blow he is tackled at the waist by another
student

which sends them both into the décor The two are evenly matched in stature
and brawling styles At the same time Titus and Randy are in taking on
another guard

Voice comes over the PA system
Break it up everybody Now

No one stops Music stops

Voice

Alright youre all under arrest

come on guys take em down Theyre all going down town tonight

At the same time the police walked in virtually everyone in the crowd
started running in all directions Randy and Titus go for Romuald

Randy
Come on man lets get out of here

They run towards the ladies bathroom They pull the guy who was brawling with
the security guard off the latter It is Solonzo Romis younger brother A
six foot five inches 289 pound lacrosse defensive player

Randy (with caution)
Solonzo Solonzo chill out dude Come on dude weve got to get out of
here (

pulling on arm) hey man lets get the fuck out of here now

Pause
Solonzo
Yow lets brake man

The trio dashed on to the ladies bathroom They make their way to the last
stall in which there was a vent leading to the back alley of the club They
kick in the screen The window gives The three guys jump out of the
window onto the back alley

Cut to

Club fight still going on The girls(Lydia and Nannette) standing alone ina
corner Officer comes over and escorts them outside

Officer

LydiaNannette
YesNo

Officer

Lydia

Cut to
From their location in the back alley the boys can see the police wagon
loading people aboard They crouch and make their way back up to the street

Three officers are wrestling to get Pierre in the police wagon

Randy
Hey Titus theres your boy

Pause
Randy

Solonzo
Whered he go Man he was right behind

Romuald
I know he was right behind me when we went into the chicks shitter

Flashback to the club

Titus ditches his jacket Runs out the front doors with a massive crowd
Officers give pursuit to the crowd

Cut to

Back to real time

Pierre
Let go you baboons That camera is worth more than your salary

Officer
Shut up and get in the wagon Im not going to say it again

Pierre

Im a reporter and youre violating my rights I know my rights both as a
citizen and as a journalist Hey look at my pass badge Im the editor-in-
chief of the U of M Herald Tribune Im here on assignment

Officer
Yeah get your ass in there

Back in the alley Randy and the others are laughing at the whole thing with
Pierre

The officers hur him on board as though he had never even mentioned a word
about his immunity

Pierre

I would have your badge for this believe me you are messing with
international rights here I ama journalist and I must be granted
permission

to cover any event that I chose

Randy

This what were going to do as soon as the wagon leaves we will head for
Pierres car You know that theyre going to be all over the place so we
cant take the hill road back to campus but campus security is not going to
stop any vehicles especially not Pierre Giinters car as much as they hate to
deal with him and his shit

Solonzo
Well what about Pierre I mean dont get me wrong but we cant just let them
take him Hes our friend

Romuald
Well juniors got a point there

Solonzo
Dont call me that I hate that

Romuald
If were going to make a run for it in his car the least we could do is try
to get him out of there

Randy

Listen here guys I would love to get him out of there and for that matter I
would like to get everyone out of the wagon the truth of the matter is we
cant save everyones ass so tough tit So you wanna go with my plan or you
want to get some signs and start picketing

Solonzo
Im game but how do we know if the keys are in the car

Both Romuald and Randy turned and looked at Solonzo and back at the Renault 5
parked across the street It was barely alive The door on the drivers
side

had some damage that looked like a series of little fender benders The
windows
were

Solonzo
OK I get it but I still say were wrong for doing this

Suddenly here comes the police impound truck backing up towards the Renault
5 The truck begins to tow the Renault

Randy and the rest are shocked in their state of defeat they noticed the
driver door of the Renault open and they see someone leap out of the car It
was none other than Titus

Randy
Thats where hes been all this while that little piece of shit How did he
get in there

Romuald
He was trying to make a break for it alone

Solonzo
Jackass

Titus meanwhile was given his best impression of James Bond meets Austin
Powers He tumbled left rolled right takes a few steps and dives into the
dumpster in the alley opposite his friends His friends watched him as he
maneuvered about with the grace of a cat Suddenly they hear a thunderous
sound of pain and rejection They all stand up at once looking in the
direction of the poorly lit alley

Randy
Titus Titus

Titus (jumping up to his feet)

Im all right (stretching his arms outward as if to reassure everyone) Im
all

right

Titus pulls on his sweater and looks across the way at the now three distinct
forms in the dark He recognizes Randys voice but he still cant make them
out clearly

Titus
Whos there Hey what are you guys doing over there

Romuald
Man its us Stay there

Titus nods his head and began looking for one of his contact lenses
The police wagon is ready to depart from the vicinity

Solonzo

Hey Titus they got Pierre hes on the wagon

Titus looks at the police wagon and suddenly starts looking around the
dumpster on the floor and in the dumpster itself He digs into his pocket
and reaches for his keys Theres a Swiss Army knife kit attached to his
key ringThe three friends on the other side of the street were looking on
totally confused Titus pulls out a devise
The police wagon begins moving A sense of urgency overtook Titus

As soon as the wagon goes pass him he ran after the wagon paces himself and
at the very next shift in gear he jumps onto the ledge All the people on
board begin cheering him on

Randy
What the fuck is that boy doing

Solonzo
Comon lets go

Romuald
Hey come back here you dumb ass Junior junior Oh well fuck it

Randy
Romi Heymanhave you all lost your damned minds fuck

All three begin running after the wagon Randy catches up with the other two

Randy
Why are we running toward the fucking wagon

Romuald (laughing)
I dont know man but I tell you what Im having a lot of fun tonight

Meanwhile Titus fidgets with the lock on the wagon Finally the lock
gives

They doors of the wagon fly open and Titus hanging on for dear life crashes
against the side of the wagon

Driver
What was that

Officer (passenger)

Crashing sound Cheering from the back of wagon
Driver

Officer(looking in side view mirror)

Cut to

Officers on the road begin turning around heading back for town
Cut to

Randy
Titus Oh shit hes gonna fall

Randy
Hold on man

They all speed up The wagon abruptly stops

As soon as the wagon stops everyone on board starts rushing out The crowd
scatters in all directions You can hear the police sirens closing in on the
scene Titus let go the gate jumps down and takes off running back toward
town

Officer (passenger)
Stop Come back here

Driver
You got him Imma go this way Backup is coming this way

Officer (passenger)
Go go Ive got this one

He starts giving chase for a moment it appeared as if he is gaining grounds
on Titus

Titus is running grimacing and holding his arm He is in pain form slamming
in the side of the wagon

The officer begins stretching to grab at Titus shirt

Officer
Gotcha

Titus evades his grab The captain of the University of Maltas soccer team
showed why he was the fastest and most lethal striker on the team

Titus begins to successfully distance himself from the officer however great
the gap is he still cant shake the determined officer Titus looks back at
the officer and then looked forward and realized that he is closing in on his
friends who have stopped to look at the race at that point a faint smile
broke out of the corner of Titus mouth He picked up the pace another notch
and then abruptly begins slowing down Before the officer realizes whats
happening he is being side swiped by Randy

Randy
Get up Get up now Whats up

The officer tries to get back up to his feet Romi and Solonzo join in the
attack

The situation quickly turned ugly The officer is being kicked on the
ground
The blue lights are coming up on the boys

Cut to
At that very moment Pierre Ginter spots a cab and hails it

Pierre

lights

he

turns and gives the cab driver a thumbs up as he walks into the brightly lit
room

Cut to

The cab driver stands outside his car looking on Suddenly the doors open
again and randy gives the driver a vigorous thumbs up again Before the
driver can move Randy signals him to wait where he is

The cab driver settles back in his car and turns on the music as he lights a
cigarette

Cut To

Randy is dashing through the building and he makes the same turn Titus made
He walks out the same doors and onto the same street He pauses for a second

looking around then shrugs his shoulders

Randy (Whispering at first)
Titus Titus that mother fucker left me man aint that some shit

Randy takes off running again This time toward the high rise tower

Cut to
The cab driver is in his car he starts the engine and revs it high trying
to

draw the attention from the house Nothing He honks his horn mildly at
first then loudly Still nothing The driver looks at his watch He
hesitates a little and then gets out of the car and heads for the house

Cut to

Randy opens a door and creeps into a house As he moves about lightly
through
the dark hes startled when the lights come on

He knocks again This time he turns the door handle The latter gives

Interior is a corridor lined stretchers on either side

Cab Driver
Fuck those kids got me Shit

Cab driver standing around undecided Hes pacing around Heads back for
the

door Stops Sound of something dropping in the background He turns
around

Cab Driver
What was that

He heads down the same direction Randy and Titus went At the same
intersection he freezes unsure of which way to go Left or right He hears
a sound coming from his right Thats good enough for him

Cab Driver(tip toeing in the direction of the noise)

Gotcha I told you not to try to fuck with me what the fuck is that
smell

Hu (covering his nose)

Cab driver heads down the hall He reaches a door and spies into the room

Theres a man in a white robe Like a doctors gown He seems to be doing

something but the cab driver is unable to see

He smells a foul stench as though some strong chemical had been used on the

premise

He opens the door and approaches the man his hand is stretched out toward
the

man

The latter is oblivious to whats going on Hes consumed with his endeavor

Cab Driver
scuse me Mr

The man turns around

Cab Driver
Sorry Mr Didnt mean to(he looks over the mans shoulder) what the
fu

No audible dialogue Through scene

The cab driver collapses to his knees He looks down Grabs his side The
man before him withdraws a surgical device out of the drivers side Its a
long shining tube with a hollow tip the look of confusion on the drivers
face gives way to a look of pain and agony He tries to breath but his lungs
are filled with blood he coughs blood on the onlookers medical robe He
had
been probed right under his left arm just beneath the third rib directly
puncturing his hearts left ventricle The man drops his weapon The driver
panics he tries to grab his attacker The latter steps back falling into a
pan filled with medical apparatus The driver slips in his own blood He is
chocking spitting blood He clutched his chest stretches out his right hand
for help With one last effort he desperately lunges for his attacker They
both hit the ground at the same time The driver grips at the white robe

He

tries to strangle his attacker the latter responds in a calm manner he
reaches behind him and grabs a saw he starts swinging the saw at the
drivers

throat

More blood

The driver still struggles with the man The attacker then strikes the
driver across his face with the saw cracking the drivers temple He strikes
again again and again until he pulls out his hand and finds a chunk of
matter
on the saws teeth The attacker then hoists the matter up to his face as if
to examine it It was the drivers brain The driver has since given up in
his struggle falling forward into the laps his murderer The latter now
sitting in a pool of blood looks at the chunk of brain matter on his weapon
draws his face closer and in a demented gesture opens his mouth sticks his
tongue out and slid it across the weapon Tasting the blood and then
collecting his bounty at the end He closes his eyes and begins chewing

they find Mrs V riveted to the screen

On TV screen at the bottom Name Dr Herman Von - Aldershmitt dept head
for the School Of Science Standing across from him is the Inspector
general

of Maltese Police

Titus

Mrs V

would be able to hear much better

Titus
Mom would you please turn the TV up

She turns the TV up

Titus
Thank you
He turns to look at his friend The latter is eating some bacon

Cut to
Live scene Police barriers reporters etc

A reporter
Dr Von - Aldershmitt is this an accident

Noran Stamp IGP(rudely interrupting)

We have reason to believe that the man found on the premises of the morgue
was

murdered

Reporter (jockeying for position)
Chief inspector chief inspector can you tell us the identity of the victim

Stamp

As of this very moment we have reason to believe that this man was a taxi
driver for Black Jack Cabs We found a taxi parked in the rear of the
morgue

Apparently the cab driver may have been an innocent victim in a deal gone
wrong A case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time

Reporter 2
What prompts your conclusion

Stamper pauses then answers

Stamp

The victims taxi was found this morning with the door ajar and the keys
still

in the ignition The first detectives at the site noticed that the grass
behind the vehicle was burned as a result they deduced that the driver had
gone into the morgue for short period of time and had not intended to stay
there for along time

Without any further examination Stamper continued his reports stump button
edged that from a the victim states the victim had walked in on and startled
the perpetrator

Cut to

Back at the residence Titus and Randy were trying to make sense of the entire
event Titus seemed more perplexed than Randy

Randy

We need to talk dude

Titus
yeah dude cmon

They head to the back room as the phone starts to ring its one of Mrs Vs
friends
MrsV(she turn and sees the boys heading for the back room)

Hey GloriaI know isnt that awful I hope that doesnt affect our annual
gala

plans I have this fabulous dress (Voice fades)

Meanwhile in the boys room an argument is heating up The music is on to
serve as a distraction

Titus
So how are we gonna tell them that we had nothing to do with the murder

Randy
Well I was thinking that we kinda didnt have to

Titus
We kinda didnt have to what What the hell are you talking about theres a
dead body out there and were the last people to have seen him alive

Randy
Alright chill out dude no need to get all hysterical man

Titus
Hysterical hysterical man what is wrong with you

Randy

Alright man fuck it do whatever you feel like After all I aint the one
with

the high profile parents my familys image will not be tarnished in any way

Titus paused and looks at Randy in a pensive way His cunning friend might
actually have a point

Randy
I mean think about it dude what about your scholarship your chance to go
pro

Titus shrugged his shoulders

Randy

Well even if you could careless about going pro think about your career Do
you want this to hang over you for ever I mean we dont even know if were
going to have to go to jail man

Titus is walking around the room waving his finger no

Titus
Man you know what you might be the one who needs to chill out No one is
going to jail

Randy looks confused

Titus

And you know why no one is going to jail Its because we aint done shit
How about that You see we took a cab just like any other person would It
just so happened that the cab we took ended up dead
Randy

Just like any other person right

How many people you know take cabs and the drivers end up dead Tell me
that

Titus
Dude there is no time for your petty sarcasm Im being for real here
Were

Randy looked at his friend shaking his head vigorously

Titus

Well I am going to tell the chief Inspector what happened and our names will
be cleared They can go catch their killer and we can go on with our lives
as

planned

Randy

And how are you going to explain beating up an officer Hun I suppose
youll explain that as well and be on your way again Living your life as
planned right

Titus realized that there was a lot more involved with his confession plans
than he realized

Randy (back in control)

So do you know how much time people do in jail for assaulting an officer

You

see by keeping your big mouth shut you stay out of trouble you know why
(Randy is pacing around with his hands behind his back and his head down)
Because the cop we jumped is a rookie and he aint going to say a word to his
counterparts because he doesnt want to be embarrassed Plus (he brandishes
his right index finger) he really doesnt know who attacked him and he only
saw you from behind for most parts but he definitely recognized the type of
cab that we got into So by you going on your goody two shoes crusade you
give the rookie a chance to win his purple heart because then all he would
have to do is reformat the story to his credit whereby he would identify the
whole lot of us as the people who attacked him kidnapped a cab and murdered
the driver for all his cash Now then Rich boy (he walks right up to Titus
staring him down) you sure about the part where everyone goes back to living
their lives as planned

Titus stunned crushed defeated and frightened
There is a knock on the door it was Mrs V she extends the phone to Titus
MrsV

You boys are OK

Randy
Yes maam

MrsV
Well come on and eat Foods getting cold

Randy (putting on a smile)

Randy (following her to shut the door)
Yes maam

MrsV heads out Titus answers the phone Phone conversation Back and
forth screen

Romuald

Randy

Titus

a murderer or am I

Randy

Right at that there was a knock on the door It was Mrs V calling the boys
There had been a breakthrough in the story and it was on the news The boys

break More bodies went missing from the morgue and now this Fear not
there is hope

The three figures stood quiet and at the same time impatient They kept
staring at the screen occasionally looking at each other

The reporter sticks the microphone in the face of the non expecting witness
The latter seemed at a loss of words He is confused

Witness

At that very moment the chief of police appeared on screen He snatched the
microphone from the witness He turned and faced the reporter
Stamp

no legitimacy in this interview Any new witness in this case must be
interrogated by the police department prior to any public interview if any at
all You have jeopardized the life of this witness and in the process
botched

Liam(jerking gun into Randys back
Shut up You walk toward the back You think I dont know whats going on

The boys walk Titus is ahead followed by Randy and Liam is behind them

The hall way is poorly lit the fluorescent tube light keeps flashing on and
off making OToole even more agitated They approach the back room Titus
turns left to enter the room

Liam
Dont go trying anything funny in there sonny jim or its your friends arse

Gun fight

As OToole speaks he leans forward When Randy feels the increasing
pressure

in his back he spins sharply to the left into the back room entry way
causing OToole to fall forward As the latter does so Randy quickly grabs
the nose of the riffle and jerks it upright OToole is taken by surprise
The last thing he expected was this entire situation to go wrong His body
instinctively followed the direction of the riffle Titus is still in the
back room with his hands over his head He is oblivious to the on going
battle in the hall way Then suddenly a gun shot In the mist of their
struggle the riffle goes off Titus panics

Titus heads for the door

Another shot goes off

Titus freezes in his tracks

He resumes running toward the door the hall way light is flashing and all he
can see are glimpses of peoples figures One of which is on the ground and
the other standing over him

Liam
I knew you were trying to kill me you bastard Im not scared of you

Randy
What the hell are you talking about No one is trying to kill you We came
to talk to you

Liam
Talk to me Talk to me I dont hear you talking

Titus walks out of the room with his hands up

Titus

Titus is surprised as his eyes adjusted to the flashing light The gunman is
not Otoole it is Randy

Titus
Randy alright dude lets get out of here man

Randy

Liam

Titus

Why the fuck are you trying to pin this on us We aint do nothing

Liam

I know what I saw and I saw you and you (pointing at Randy and Titus)
running

out of the morgue that night

Randy (pointing the riffle at Otoole)
You didnt see shit

Titus grabs at the barrel of the riffle and pulled it up from Otoole The
riffle went off again
Randy
What the hell are you doing man

Titus
I thought you were going to do something stupid

While the two friends are arguing OToole ceases the opportunity to run into
the back office The boys realize and give chase but the old man has already
turned the lock on the door They try to force the door open but it is to no
avail

Titus
Open the door were not gonna hurt you

The boys try to catch their breath and sound assuring but no one answers on
the other side of the door

Titus
OToole open the door please I promise were not going to hurt you

Randy (he shoves his shoulder into the door)
Open the fucking door

There is no response from OToole

Randy
Open this door or Ill shout it open

Titus

Liam(on the other side)

The boys take to their heels They frantically ran out of the building
dashing across the street to the campus diner Theybarge into the diner and
sit at the corner table looking back at the morgue

Waitress

The boys walk out of the café and headed to the north end of the campus
There is another café at that end of the campus This one was notoriously
known for its student clientele and its extremely provocative waitresses
One of which was Randys girlfriend Nanette

They arrive at the café

Cut to

Pierre is going up the stairs of the morgue The door is opened wide He
walks in everything is in disarray

Pierre

Hello Is anybody here Hello Im with the campus press and I need to
speak

to the night watchman hello Hello

He walks up to the security booth The two way radio is behind the booth but
no one is in there Pierre keeps calling out to anyone without ever getting
a
response He make a right turn onto the hall way that lead to the back room
As he walks he noticed the lights flashing on and off He keeps walking
in
the dark Suddenly he steps on a piece of glass The glass brakes under his
foot He maneuvers around that piece of glass only to step onto another
piece Pierre looks down at the ground and realized that there are piece of
shattered glass all over the ground His feet were barely coming off the
ground He is closing in on the brake room it was on his left Pierre puts
his hand up against the wall and feels his way up to the door as his hand is
running smoothly against the wall Suddenly he feels a hole in the wall He
makes it to the back room No one is there There is one last room to check
on this wing and that is the security guards lounge As Pierre approached
the last door he noticed footprint marked on the door He grabs the door
handle turns it Pierre opens the door and wedges his face through the
slight opening no sign of danger

Pierre
Hello is anybody here

No one answers Pierre walks into the room the phone is off the hook He
wonders what is going on There is a draft coming in from the back of the
room He looks in the direction of the draft Its from a window cracked
open Pierre walks toward the window to shut it He reaches forward with
his

left arm contouring a coat rack Pierre grabs the edge of the window and
begins pushing down The window does not budge he pushes down harder still
no progress Pierre tries to move the coat rack in order to use both arms
The window still doesnt budge He is determined to shut the window down
Pierre reaches around the rack with his right arm to push down He touches
something soft and before he can assess what he is touching he feels sharp
teeth come down on his right index finger Pierre pulls back loses his
balance and hits the deck all at once At the same time a black cat jumps
down from the window ledge into the room It lands on Pierres chest then
pounced off out of the room

Pierre (rubbing on his chest)
Oh shit shit shit shit

Pierre sits up and tried desperately to gather his thoughts He reached for
the coat rack pulls himself up to his feet and turns around only to be met
by

the fixed stare of an onlooker sitting in the corner Pierres jaw drops he
freezes in his stance immobilized by the sight before him Its a corpse
White female mid forties Pierre begins feeling nauseous and scrambles for
his inhaler Pierre pumps once twice finally he breathes Pierre takes off
running out of the room He struggles out of the room and back into the
poorly lit hallway he bumps into a cart causing an arm to fall out and grab
him around his left thigh Pierre spins away from the body only to fall onto
another cart Theres no body on this cart but the wheels at the base of the
cart are not locked in and this causes the cart to spin off forward sending
Pierre to the ground once again He stretches out his hands to break his
fall Upon contact he feels a sharp pain surge through his body his hand
lands on a piece of glass Pierre immediately rolls to his side to alleviate
the pain from his palm He pulls the piece of glass out of his palm and
wraps

his hand with a handkerchief gets up and walks toward the lab at the other
end of the corridor He sees some motion through the opaque glass This is
it this is what hes here for - a story- Pierre pulls out his camera turns
on the flash and approaches the lab door Theres some music playing in the
lab Pierre opens the lab door and sees an attendant in a robe He walks up
on the person This person is standing over a body it appeared as if he is
draining blood from the corpse a little saw is sitting to his right

Besides

the corpse is a sink linked to various chemicals

Pierre
Excuse me Hey excuse me Im looking for the night watch

No response Pierre keeps on walking toward the attendant He approaches
the

man taps him on the shoulder and as the man turns he noticed that the latter
is removing an implant from the corpses breast

Pierre
Im sorry didnt mean to startle you

Man w face mask(drops implant)
Oh my I didnt hear you come in

Pierre(looking at the implant)
Im sorry to disturb you but Im looking for the night watchman
Man (bending over to pick up implant)
Why I mean Im sorrythe night watchman you say I havent seen him

The man is unable to pick up the rather slippery implant so he resorts to
stabbing the implant with a prong and picking it up

Man (dropping implant in a sink)
Sorry about that Can I help you with anything

Pierre gives no answer instead he looks into the mans eyes

Man( looking perturbed and disoriented)
What the hell are you doing here Who the hell are you Looking for the
night watchman hey

Pierre(stepping backward)

Hey calm down Mr and could you not point that thing at me (referring to
the

surgical blade) I heard someone in here and I wanted to come in and ask a
few

questions

Liam(waving the weapon at Pierre)
I asked who the hell you were

Pierre

Im sorry Im sorry My name is Giinter Pierre I am with the tribune and
I

am covering the story about the murder that took place in this morgue You
know what Im referring to right

man changed his composure

Pierre
Im sorry I didnt catch your name

Man

Thats because I never told you my name And by the way Im the one asking
the questions around here got it Now this tribune thing of yours how much
is it paying

Pierre

It depends What do you know Are you pre-med (looking and pointing at
the

blade )

Man (hesitating slightly)
Yeah Im doing some work uh on my own You know how it is try to get ahead
of class and stuff(acting ever so friendly)

Pierre

Yeah yeah I know just what youre talking about you have to work hard to
get

ahead of the competition You know what I mean(referring to himself Pierre
points at his camera and positions it for a snap shot) by the way what year
are you

Man (becoming apprehensive again)
Oh Im just a first year student

Pierre
And youre aloud to work in the lab already

Man (frustratedtakes mask off Its Liam )

Look here Mr something tells me that youre not here for the murder story
after all What do you want here Who are you looking for Did you come
out

here to investigate me hun You with that damned Stamp right

Pierre (looking confused and scared at Lims aggressive behavior)

Stamp who is Stamp Hey Mr Maybe we have a misunderstanding Ill just go
now I really do not know what youre talking about I just came here to
cover the story on you and to see what happened with Titus and Randy (Liam
stop following Pierre He began to wonder how Pierre knew who he was) Seems
to me youre a little paranoid about your little project back there
Liam(dashing toward a switch on the wall and depressing it)

And seems to me as if you know a lot more than youre letting on lad (Pierre

tries to unlock the door behind him but it wouldnt move) Youre with those
other two(Liam is walking back toward the middle of the aisle He picks up a
hatchet looking device Pierre sees him) Youre here to try to kill me

two

Well not today lad

Pierre
Hey there no one is here to kill anyone

Pierre turns around and struggles with the door again It doesnt budge By
the time he turns around Liam is charging toward him in an instant Pierre
dives behind one of the beds He is quickly back up to his feet Liam is
giving chase As Liam make the turn Pierre who is under the table retracts
his steps and rolls back underneath the first table and across the floor over
to the opposite aisle and underneath another table His breathing is frantic
but hes trying to keep it down the best he can Meanwhile Liam is on the
other side babbling incoherently

Liam

Yeah see everything was just fine that night I came in to get the bodies
like he told me to I knew it when it all went down last night I told him
Id bring it to him but no here come the other two last night Thats when
I

left See I knew theyd try to get me like that poor fellow last night
Everything was suppose to go according to plan Then come that loud mouth
reporter guy see I figured thats how Id get my money since he didnt want
to pay up I told him Id tell the officers the whole thing But no that
guy

had to throw a wrench in my fucking program

Pierre reaches into his pocket and pulls out a recorder and starts taping
As

he looks for a place to hide the recorder he notices the source of all the
electrical cables in the lab Pierre decides to retrace his steps to the
source and turn off the power

Liam
What you do that for Fat boy You buying yerself some time here Come on
out and old Liam and you talk it over hun what do you say
No answer Liam starts throwing the beds around

Liam

Oh well fuck it See I have it all figured out now After your dead Ill go
call the officers Oops I already did that Ha all I have to do is tell
them that you and your friends attacked me and in self defense I killed you
but the others got away Theyll get arrested and Ill walk Now hows
that for a plan

Liam flipped the last table on that side Theres nothing there

Liam is surprised He heads for the other aisle Ina big rage Liam dashed
toward the opposite aisle and rammed the beds together in no particular
format Pierre realized that Liam is approaching

Liam rams the tables

Pierre scoots over to the corner pins himself against the wall and looks
up

Above him is a panel of switches He jumps up and starts turning the
switches

in all the opposite directions Liam sees him and dashes toward him with his
weapon brandished high in the air Pierre hit the first switch nothing
happens

Liam is closing in on Pierre

Pierre hits a succession of switches in any direction Several things come
on

and off
The labs mainframe goes off the air suction tank comes on whistling
everywhere Liam is five feet away from Pierre

Pierre grabs his rosary cross and just stands there petrified Just at that
moment the hose to which the air tank is connected swings violently lashing
Liam OToole in the face

Liam(grabbing his faceblood)
Ah your dead your fucking dead Im telling you

The air hose leaves a deep gash across his face Pierre hits the last
switch

Lab is totally dark except for light from the hallway

Liam crying out loud Liam palmed his face screaming obscenities

Pierre runs back across the aisle Liam follows He stumbles across the
aisle falls into a pan of surgical tools He grabs at the first thing
Pierre is in the dark Pierre tries to stand up to see where Liam is He

slips in the spilled silicone solution causing him to drop to the floor
Liam hears the fall He swings a fork like instrument and hits the wall
Pierre reaches for his camera and points it toward Liam OToole and snaps
three consecutive shots of the assailant Liam is blinded Pierre jumps up
The two men start to wrestle Pierre tries to tackle OToole at the waist
but he slips OToole capitalizes on this error He landed an elbow flush
into Pierres back Pierre let go his grip OToole spins him around and
tries to reach for yet another weapon

Hissing sound of the air hose in background
The two men battled each other out One driven by anger and the other driven
by fear The hose keeps swinging around and all of a sudden it strikes
Pierre in the back This drives him forward into OToole Pierre falls on
the ground OToole stumbles back as Pierre looks up at the man who is
about

to take his life OTooles kicks him across his face turning his face into
one of the bed posts

Then nothing

Pierre slowly turns around to see what OToole is waiting for to finish him
off As he looks out of the corner of his eye he notices OTooles feet
dangling off the edge of the table Pierre slowly rises to his feet He
only
then notices a sound from OToole This was the sound of a meat cleaver
Pierre slowly rises to his feet and looks up only to see Liam OToole lying
on
his back gutted out from his throat down to his naval Theres a rotary
cutter protruding from his chest The cutter seems jammed Pierre comes
closer and the machine begins spinning again causing OToole to spin his body
upward ripping through his chest As the devise spin backward it pulls
OTooles body backward A tear drop runs out of the corner of OTooles
agonizing face

Liam(gargling blood)
Please Make it stop Please Please

Pierre (approaching)
I IoIm sorry

Pierre heads for the switch panel and turns a series of switches on and off

The lights come on the air tank goes out and so does the cutter Pierre
turns in shock There is blood all over the walls OToole is lying there
with his intestines exposed and mangled in the blade Pierre reaches for his
inhaler but he can not find it He starts running out of the lab He
crushes

into the doors but they are still shut Theres a red switch right next to
OTooles still body Pierre makes his way back to the body reaches over
OToole and presses the switch Suddenly he feels a grab on his wrist its
OToole in his death grip

Pierre(in panic)
Oh Oh shit (he pulls away) let go (he falls and finally brakes the
grip)

As suddenly as it happened it was over Pierre watches OTooles arm slump
to the side

OTooles hand opens Pierre sees his rosary in the mans hand Pierre
reaches and pulls the latter out of the dead mans hand Pierre backs out
of

the lab stumbling on beds and stepping over corpses He makes it into the
hallway

He hears the distinct sound of sirens coming toward him
Cut to approaching police cars Sirens and lights

Stamp(in one carpassenger)
Comon step on it I cant believe you

Officer (driving)
I didnt take the call sir I can assure you I would have relayed it to you

Stamp
How do you get a 911 and think its a prank call Tell me Im waiting

Cut to back to Pierre

Pierre stalls for a minute looks through the front doors and grabs the door
handle He can see the police vehicles approaching

He stops Steps back Pierre backtracks his steps and runs out of the
building through the loading entry Pierre clutches his chest hes having an
asthma attack He digs his hand into his pocket to grab his inhaler Its
not there

Cut to camera shot of inhaler in the on the ground in the lab
Cut to back to Pierre

Pierre

f-u-c-k

Pierre freezes in his tracks looking back at the morgue Pierre heard the
police officers approach the rear of the building Pierre runs through the
woods that separate the dorms from the rest of the school

He heads for his dorm He sees it in the distance

Officers walk outside the back door Noise from the bushes

Officer(with flash light)
Whos there You hear something

Officer2 (pulling out flashlight)

Cut to back inside the morgue

Stamp and the forensic team are at work

Titus stares straight out the window toward the morgue He can see some
police lights in the distance as well as hear the faint sound of sirens
Titus keeps staring Suddenly he turns Nanette is sitting directly across

Nanette grabs him by the balls firmly at first then She softly caressed

Randy slams her into the wall and kisses her hard

Cut to
Pierre (bursting into the room)
Hey Lloyd What you doing here

Lloyd
Well well if it isnt the Pulitzer prize winner Mr Ginter Whats the
matter with you now

Pierre
None of your business

Lloyd

Well pardon my intrusion in your exiting life Oh by the way this happens
to

be my room at least for a few more hours

Pierre (feeling apologetic)
Im sorry Lloyd I lost it its just that I have so much on my mind and I
shouldnt have done that

Lloyd reaches into the liquor cabinet under the study desk and pulls out a
bottle of Chivas-Regal He ignores Pierre Pierre in the mean time is
scrambling for his clothes gathering them in no particular manner Lloyd
sits on Pierres bed interrupting the latter from packing up his belongings

Lloyd
So whats the big rush Why the last ferry to Paris is leaving the dock

Pierre(in a very aggressive manner)
You know what Im not in the mood OK Today just aint the day for this
shit so why dont you just back up

Lloyd

How rude Mr Giinter I see youve been wallowing about with those hooligan
friends of yours again Well I do hope that this is but a phase of rebellion
in your ever so pathetic life

Pierre turns around points his finger at Lloyd Lloyd stands up grabs Pierre
by the hand and bites down on his finger Pierre strikes Lloyd on the head
with his other hand Hes in pain from his cut his hand starts bleeding
again Lloyd lets go of Pierres finger and reaches for Pierres poorly
bandaged hand Lloyd twists Pierres arm backward causing his palm to face
up He notices the deep gash on Pierres palm

Lloyd
Bloody hell What on earth happened to you

Pierre(going limp)
Let go off me now Lloyd

There is absolutely no resistance from Pierre Lloyd loosens his grip on
Pierre and watches the latter walk off toward a mirror Pierre rubs his hand

as he looks through the mirror back at Lloyd

Lloyd
What happened to your hand Pierre

Pierre(still looking in the mirror and rubbing his palm)
Nothing much I got in a fight

Lloyd
You Mr Do right got in a fight What or who on earth could have made you
so upset as to get in a fight

Pierre
What do you care

Lloyd(gulping a chunk of ice from his glass of Chivas Regal)
Well youre absolutely right I do not care about your well being however I
find it most entertaining to find out whom you fought with

Pierre turns around and stares Lloyd in the eyes the latter begins crushing
the ice with his teeth and stirs his drink pausing to look at Pierre

Lloyd(holding glass up)
A toast The tame have grown some fangs

Pierre
Go fuck yourself man

Lloyd
Youve been hanging around those illiterates havent you

Pierre does not answer The silent in the room is broken when the sirens
sound off on campus Pierre rushes back to his bag stuffs the rest of his
belongings in he hurrys for the door

Voice in the hallway
Fuck the police

Lloyd follows him around with his arms crossed still holding his drink and
without saying a word steps in front of the door

Lloyd

OK first I was kidding but em Where are you going Is the police escort
for

you

Pierre tries to move Lloyd but the latter is standing his ground Pierre
swings his bag at Lloyd

Pierre
Get the fuck out of the way damn it

Taken by surprise Lloyd spills his drink on himself Lloyd has a burst
upper

lip Lloyd drops his drink and stumbles for a couple of steps By the time
he gathers himself up Pierres exiting the room Lloyd dashes for the door
after Pierre and runs smack into the door He pauses for a second pulls his
lower lip out and realized that hes cut again

Lloyd(holding his lip)
Bloody hell You are one dead chap
Lloyd turns the door handle hes bulldozed by Pierre again Lloyds on the
ground again Pierre goes for the light switch and turns off the lights in
the room Lloyd gets back up A knock comes on the door

Voice
Mr Giinter Mr Pierre Giinter This is officer Bryant of the metro
police

I need to speak to you Mr Gunter

Lloyd looks at Pierre not knowing exactly what to expect from him Pierre
doesnt answer the door Lloyd reaches for the door knob Pierre leaps from
his crouched position around the bed steps on the bed and stops Lloyd from
opening the door Lloyd tries to open the door

Lloyd (whispering)
Youve got something to say to me (knocking persists on door) You better
make it quick

Officer Bryant
Mr Giinter Mr Ginter is everything OK Sir I just need to ask you a
few questions about the morgue

Lloyd grabbed Pierre by the collar

Lloyd (whispering)
Youre going to tell me what in bloody hell is going on or else Ill turn you
in

Pierre (whispering)
There is absolutely nothing going on Now tell him Im not here and Ill
explain everything to you

Officer Bryant
Sir now youre only wanted for questioning thats it

Lloyd opens the door as the officer is speaking The officer steps back and
reaches for his side arm Stretching his free arm forward in caution toward
Lloyd Pierre in the mean time is behind the door begging Lloyd not to say
anything

Lloyd(licking his own blood)
So what are you planning to do with that(pointing at the Billie club on the
officers side) You intent on using that

Officer
Stand back sir Im here for Mr Ginter What are you doing here

Lloyd(still advancing)
Why dont you do me a favor and tell me what is going on What happened at
the morgue Do you know who I am

Officer (backed up to the wall)
Sir this is police business This has nothing to do with you so please back

up Im not going to say it again

The officer removes his club Lloyd walks right up on him giving him little
room to maneuver The officer brandishes his club Lloyd who towers over
the

latter grabs his wrist and pulls it over the officers head The officer
reaches for his whistle and starts blowing Soon the entire floor was
filled

with officers

Students fill the hallway They are cheering and throwing things at the
officers

Lloyd keeps his distant demeanor

Stamp(only hear his voice)
Everybody back in your rooms now now I said less you want to take a ride
downs town

Students
Booassholeyour mothers a bearded goat

Stamp walks through the crowd

Stamp
Ah if it isnt British Royalty at its best behavior Listen here kiddo how

And since you ask so kindly I guess I will oblige you

Stamp
Listen here kid wheres your buddy Mr Whats his name

Officer
Gunter

Stamp
Yeah the fat kid

Lloyd

I do not associate myself with the likes of that whom you have just
described

And if you are referring to my roommate I have not seen him today Now
then

if you and your less academically inclined fellows are done exhibiting their
testosterone overflow I will return to my quarters now and ponder whether or
not I would like to prosecute

Stamp
Prosecute me For what What could you possibly have to prosecute the
department on

Lloyd
Youre the cop figure it out By the way do you have a warrant

Stamp( walking off with Lloyd and grabbing him around his neck Insinuating
to be friends)

Listen kiddo I believe this royalty crap is gone to your head but I would
like

to make you abundantly aware of the fact that I dont like your ass And if
your name is in anyway shape or form linked to these murders you better
believe me itll take more than the queen to get your ass out of jail Ive
got your buddys prints all over the place too Remember that

Lloyd(speaking through his teeth to muffle the pain in his voice)

Well Im glad that we made our feelings about each other abundantly clear but
Im afraid that how do you people say it Oh yeah in an American Accent
youre barking up the wrong treepatna

Stamp looks at Lloyd smiles and begins walking away The officers part to
let him through He stopped in his tracks turned

T have a feeling that Ill be seeing you sooner than you think Have a nice
day kiddo

Lloyd watched as all the law enforcers walked away

Cut to

The three other passengers all sigh in deject

Lydia (turning her head while driving)

Here we go again with the cadet school stuff Dude you were in high school
and besides you cadet honor has nothing to do with duping a cab driver So
wont you do us all a favor and drop the cadet thing This has nothing to do
with being a cadet this has to do with you being irresponsible (She turns
to

Titus) and you too How could you I thought you had a mind of your own

Titus never looks back at her he remains staring out of the window

Lydia

You hear me talking while you guys spend so much time making fun of Pierre
Ginter you could learn from him See instead of dodging officers hes on his
way home with that weirdo Lloyd Lord Lard or what ever his name is

Titus turns his head for the first time He looks at Lydia as though she
was insane She turns around

Lydia
Yes sir

Titus turns back to the window he begins to mumble under his breath

Titus

Hes gone home OK If youre going to spend your evening bashing us about
what

happened then at least get your facts straight

Lydia

What are y-o-u talking about I have my facts straight I know whom I saw
it

was Pierre and that fag Lloyd Now where ever they went is none of my
business

Randy
Youre damn right
Lydia(looking back through the rear view mirror)

Like I said I saw both of them in the airport and I saw both of them get in
Lloyds jet(she pauses a little)As a matter of fact I should have known
when I saw him all bruised up that he was involved in something with you

Replay scene in black and white as Pierre tries to avoid eye contact with
Lydia at the airport

Nanette
I thought that guy was gay

Randy

Pierres cool Shit you all talk so much crap man I dont know what you

by the dorm let me go holler at French boy one time

Lydia ignores him He keeps on insisting She eventually gives in and pulls
over in front of the dorm Randy jumps out and heads up the stairs to the
entrance of the dorm leaping over flights of stairs at once Titus opens the
door and steps out

Lydia
Titus Titus Where you going baby

Titus (mumbling)
No where damn it

He pulls out a cigarette she calls on him through the passenger window

Nanette
He is really bugging out You better get your boy before he flips out

Lydia walks out of the car after Titus She walks up behind him and hugs him
resting her head in his back He lifts his head blows out some smoke

Lydia
Baby it will be ok All we have to do is go to the police an explain what
happened They will understand Ok I know what youre dad is going to say
about the whole thing but eventually hell understand that it was just an
accident These things happen What we have to focus on now is how to
explain the whole thing

Titus (puts out the cigarette clasps her hands)
You dont know what my dad will say And on top of that you dont have to
lose your scholarship and everything that

Randy comes out running yelling something Nanette slouched in the back
seat

Shes doing her nails She pries herself up on her elbows to see what the
ruckuss about

Well did you know that he was wanted by the officers

reaction shock from everyone
Cut to

Lloyd (showing Pierre his room)
Youre really going to like it here

Pierre(looking in amazement)
Wow thanks Lloyd I still dont know why you did that for me Lloyd I know
that I have not exactly been the best roommate to you

Lloyd (holding his hand over his lips)

Not to worry sir I just believe that you did what you had to do So without
any further ado change clothes and come with me I will introduce you to
the

family

Pierre (still confused)
Like I said I really dont understand why youre doing this for me but I
thank you for what you did and for what youre still doing

Lloyd

Well think of it this way I was bored and I needed some company and since
you

seemed to show more fortitude in one night than I have ever seen you show in
an entire year I deem it fit to be around you Plus I never liked that
constable Stamp

Pierre
You mean Chief Inspector right

Lloyd
No I mean constable and a foreign one add that

Pierre simply stands there looking at Lloyd still amazed at the magnificence
of the room
Lloyd

The issue is not the fact that he is a foreigner I obviously dont have a
problem with them but he is an American And that is different You of all
people know that I have absolutely no problems with foreigners
But(licking his split lower lip) I owe you a rematch anyway

Lloyd walks over to the door opens it and signals Pierre to follow him
Pierre is disoriented Lloyd realizes it

Lloyd
We came in another way

Pierre only answers with a nod He is captivated by the series of paintings
on the walls Both sides of the corridor are adorned with portraits of
gentleman and ladies who appear to be Lloyds ancestors Lloyd stops and
lets him catch up with him

Lloyd
It is the family and its long tradition Im afraid that one day I will have
to assume responsibility of the entire estates of the family Ah what a

chore Nothing that youll ever have to worry about

Lloyd chuckles and turns back around to lead the way In the distance at the
end of the hallway is a portrait of one of Lloyds male ancestors Unlike
the

other portraits this one has a menacing stare and an aura permeated from his
stature

Pierre

Thats one mean looking dude

Lloyd

That my dear is Baron Cambridge Right this way sir

Lloyd ushers Pierre

Pierre
Wow Does this place ever end How much more

He finds himself at the top of a steep stairway adorned with expensive
tapestry and golden ledges on either sides at the very bottom of the stairs
are two monstrous bronze felines each mounted with two sets of dragon heads
Pierre stands at the top of the stairs and marvels at the shear size of his
surrounding

Lloyd dabbed him in the back urging him to progress down the stairs

Half way down the stairs Pierre turns around only to see Lloyd standing at
the top his arms opened wide

Lloyd
Welcome to my humble abode May this be a most memorable stay for you Mr
Gunter

Cut to back on campus

Titus
Are you serious Pierre couldnt

Randy

Yup I knew it that guy was the real weirdo but no (in a feminine voice)
Randy just cant stand Pierre cause hes sweet and has a real French accent
Well fuck a damn accent Im telling you he got that Nazi in him and you
cant change that bottom line Now you can say all you want about me but you
all

Nanette
Shut up baby youre full of it and you know it too You know that is not
like him

Randy (mumbling)
I dont know shit

Nanette(rolling her eyes and raising her voice)
SO dont even start with your Nazi shit talk

Lydia
Maybe thats why he was with Lloyd

Titus
Why

Lydia

Well because they were together and unless Pierre is gay I find no reason
for

them being together

Titus
What So if two guys are together it means their gay

Randy (mumbling)
I aint gay man

Nanette
Shut up baby

Randy (mumbling)
Matter of fact I like all the puss I can get

Nanette (stressing)
PLEASE shut up

Randy (mumbling)
Big puss small puss tight puss loose puss black puss white puss hairy
puss shaved puss prissy puss stank puss nasty puss virgin puss etc

Lydia(while Randy is mumbling)
No Love Im not just saying that because they were together I know this for
a fact Lloyd is gay

Titus

How do you know this for a fact I mean what do you mean by for a fact
What

you tried to throw it at him and he said no I mean what
Lydia

Ok enough of this youre not going to keep talking to me like this you
understand

Titus tries to interrupt her but he is met with strong rebuff

Lydia

Understand Now I did not try (waving her hands in an exaggerated manner)
to

date Lloyd She (pointing at Nanette) dated him for a while And she told
me that he was gay Happy now

Randy stopped mumbling turned to face Nanette

Randy
What the fuck is she talking about

Nanette
It was a long time ago and like she said nothing ever happened The guy is
gay

Randy is not amused by the whole thing

Randy
When did this happen

Nanette
What difference does it make Were together

Randy
Together yeah right like I said when did this happen

Nanette
And then what

Randy (raising his voice as he speaks)
And then Ill fucking decide Now I asked when did this happen This aint
fucking twenty questions I asked a simple question and I want a simple answer
so are you going to answer yes or no

Nanette (becoming defensive)
Yeah we dated for a while but he was into playing crazy stuff and he was only
interested in one form of sex

Randy

You get reamed whats your problem That should be right up your alley
literally Well well what do you know after all this flack Ive been
getting

about looking at chicks and stuff like that not knowing all this time I was
the good guy Well how about that

Lydia
Come on Randy cut it out Its not what you think

Randy
You know what Im about sick of you Its never what I think and Im forever
jealous of some shit Well fuck every body
Titus (shaking his head)
Wow wow easy now my man

Randy

Man dont even try that cause you know I wouldnt come at your chick like
that

if she hadnt come at me wrong first

Titus (nodding his head in approval)
I told you to stay out of this whole thing didnt I

Randy

You know what Im not even going to worry about you I dont really care for
Pierre but one thing I can say about him is that hes never lied to me Come
on Titus We need to find out whats going on with Pierre He might be in
trouble

The four friends got back in the car Titus drove Randy was in the passenger
seat looking out the window In the back seat were the two girls Nanette

was looking out the window crying Lydia stretched over to comfort her friend
but the latter shrugged her shoulder away from her friend

Lydia
Im sorry nette I didnt mean to

Nanette
Just leave me alone please

Lydia
Im so sorry

Cut to
Enter Aristide and Lady Van-Hess

The room is comfortably lit there are three massive chandeliers one center
piece and two smaller chandeliers on either side of the center piece

In the background Vivaldis The four Seasons is playing Utter silence at
the table Pierre stretches over and sees his reflection though the shine of
the cherry maple table Pierre picks up his silverware and notices an
engraving in gold at the bottom of the sterling silver fork The letters
read

CcY

Right then the double doors of the dining room fly open In comes a tall
and

lanky framed bald gentleman pushing a passenger in a wheelchair The
squeaking sound of the wheel chair echoes painfully in the otherwise empty
room Closely follows the uneven sound of footsteps Pierre looks at the
approaching figures completely unaware of whom they might be

The two characters appear they suddenly stop The wheel chair stops just
shy
of the light cast by the chandelier You can see the frail hands clad with
enormous diamond rings on each ring finger The hands lay flat atop a quilt
that covered the lower and mid section of the person in the seat The
gentleman pushing the wheelchair seems more like an extension of the chair
than a human being He stands there lifeless emitting a cold aura

Heavy breathing coming from the character in the wheelchair

Lloyd
Ah how rude of mine Mr Giinter meet Lady Van-Hess My mother

Pierre(shooting out of his seat)
Im sorry I did not mean to be ill-mannered maam I honored to meet you

Pierre paces himself toward the lady in the wheelchair extending his arm to
greet her Out of the dark lunges a long arm with tentacle like fingers
The

tentacles wrap around Pierres wrist He tries to break lose from the firm
grip to no avail The shadowy character is breathing heavily

Lloyd(realizing whats happening)

Easy easy everyone My apologies I should have informed you This is
Aristide Meyer the familys trusty confidant See Mr Aristide has been
with the family for as long as I can remember As you have noticed by now
he

is very protective of the family He only thought that you were somewhat
aggressing my mother

Pierre

Really I wonder why given the fact that I was only being polite and he was
the assailant (Pierre is rubbing his bruised wrist never once taking his
stare away from the dark figure)

Lloyd
Really Pierre Aristide meant you absolutely no harm If he did you would
have no disillusions about it

Pierre (showing signs of intimidation)
Well I still havent heard an apology from him

Lloyd

Well save yourself the anticipation for you will never hear any such thing
come out of him Actually you will not hear anything from Aristide (Pierre
directs a questioning and angered glance at Lloyd)you see my dear Aristide
lost his tongue

Pierre
What do you mean lost his tongue you dont just lose a tongue so what
happened

Lloyd
since you insist and since I hear no opposition from Aristide I will tell
you He cut off his own tongue during a robbery in order not to reveal the
location of the family jewels

Pierre stands still floored in amazement at the devotion of the figure behind
the wheel chair All this while Lady Van-Hess is still slumped in her seat
oblivious to the entire ruckus going on around her Lloyd taps Pierre on the
shoulder and leads the latter out of the room The two walk down another
hallway and out into a maze The air is heavy the fogs set low He
watches

Lloyd walk ahead of him with his arms behind his back

Lloyd
Well Pierre my good man what do you think

Pierre
What

Lloyd
I said what do you think of me and my milieu Obliviously you have some
questions on your mind so I would like to answer them the best I can

Pierre
For starters you could tell me why you brought me here Why did you tell
Stamper that I was not in the room

Lloyd
Because you told me to

Pierre
I never said a word

Lloyd

Oh you did sir You specifically signaled me not to say a word and I
obliged Are you denying that now If you are accusing me of lying to the
police then I am guilty but if you are for one minute insinuating that you
never advised me to tell the officers what I told them then my good friend I
believe that you are going to cause me to be extremely vexed and I dont
think

that it would be in any of us best interest to see me vexed

Lloyd backtracks his steps to Pierre and stares down at him Pierre takes a
step back and starts heading toward his room As he looks up he notices a
figure in the window of his bedroom but as quickly as he sees the body the
latter disappears

Pierre(turning to Lloyd)
Did you see that

Lloyd is no longer standing in the vicinity Pierres baffled he calls out
for Lloyd to no avail

Sound from deeper in the maze

It almost sounded like the sound of an infant crying

Pierre turns with his back to the manor looking at the entrance of the maze
the sound of the infant is drawing closer and closer

Pierre feels a presence over his shoulder

He spins around in panic No one was there
He turns back toward the maze the sound had stopped

Pierres confused He begins double stepping back to the manor
He hears the sound of dogs running out of the maze toward him

Pierre hastens his pace changing into full strides The dogs sound closer
Pierre sees the dimly lit stairs leading to the manor in the near distance
Just as he takes another step hes almost knocked off balance He narrowly
escapes a bite from one of the dogs

Pierre regroups himself the stairs are at hand He leaps over as many of
them as he can at once Finally the top of the stairs Pierre runs right
into the massive doors they seem locked The dogs are almost upon him but
the

wet marble steps cause the dogs to slip and fall buying Pierre just enough
time to try the door again

Pierre (banging on door)
Open this fucking door now Open the damn door

The door gives

Pierre falls into the foyer

He kicks the door shut

Everyones standing over him looking down at him

Above him stands Lloyd Aristide and in the wheel chair Lady Van-Hess
Pierres looking at them upside down He scrambles back to the door wedging
his back against the wall Pierre looks at the three people standing before
him

Pierre
What the hell is going on here

no answer

Pierre
Where did you go

Lloyd
Who

Pierre
What the hell do you mean who You damn it What the fuck happened back
there

Lloyd
What

Pierre
The dogs the fucking dogs

Lloyd(reaching out to Pierre who backs away)

I think you need to rest Pierre you are not feeling well Youre
delirious

Come on lets get you to your room you need to rest Its been a long
couple of days

Pierre
What are you fucking talking about Cant you hear the dogs

Lloyd (raising his voice)
I was trying to help you hear but youre not giving me much to work with
What are you talking about There are no dogs on the grounds

Pierre
Cant you fucking hear

Lloyd (interrupting)
Hear what There is nothing to hear why dont you listen for a while youre
the only one causing the commotion

Pierre decides to quiet down
Theres no noise outside Pierre is confused
Lloyd walks past him and opens the door

Pierre(scrambling to his feet)
Dont dont open that door there are dogs out there

Lloyd does just that and to Pierres surprise the only sound outside is that
of the strong wind crashing against the manor and causing the old abode to
rattle

Lloyd(stretching his hand at Pierre)
Please come come see for yourself

Pierre stretches his hand back at Lloyd who pulls him up to his feet Pierre
looks out of the door where he is met with a heavy mist

Pierre

Im telling you Im not crazy I know

To his surprise there is nothing before him There is nothing in the
distance either

He takes a shaky step forward looking out toward the entrance of the maze
Where did the dogs go He looks down toward the maze as if expecting
something

to come out toward him

Pierre snaps out of his trance when Lloyd puts a hand on his shoulder He
turns and looks at Lloyd

Lloyds lips are moving but Pierre hears absolutely nothing

Pierre

It bit me ( he bends over reaching for his pants leg) see see how did this
happen I told you there were dogs if not how did this happen Where did
the

marks come from

As Pierre was pleading his case Aristide pushes the wheelchair outside
Pierre

becomes erratic in his behavior He begins laughing and pointing at his
pants

hes baking up toward the stairs Lloyd approaches him slowly saying
nothing

Pierre warns Lloyd not to take another step Lloyd keeps approaching
suddenly Lloyd stoops This brisk motion causes Pierre to take rapid steps
back As Lloyd stands up he brandishes something toward Pierre Pierre
jerks back stumbles backward on the steps The last thing Pierre sees
before he passes out is Lloyd holding a twig with a piece of cloth attached
to
it Its the missing part of Pierres pants Pierre passes out soon after
Cut to

Randys on the phone Lydia and Titus are in the distance pacing around
Nanettes on the other side of the street standing alone Randys off the
phone and runs toward the couple

Randy
Stamper has agreed to meet us on the football field in an hour He promised
hell be alone

Titus
And you trust him to show up alone right

Randy

I never said I did but suddenly I couldnt care less what happened to me
All

I know is I have a true friend missing and Im going to do all I can to try
to

find him before anything bad happens

Lydia
That is if nothing has happened yet

Randy

Nothing has happened yet

So you want to stand here and deliberate on what to do or you want to come
on

If you dont come Ill understand Obviously youre all to important to be
bothered with a guy like Pierre

Lydia (pissed)

Hey thats enough that was just mean You think you can be mean to a guy
all

year long and suddenly because your feelings are hurt and because you feel
you

cant trust anyone around you you become his best friend Well news flash
Mr thats not quite how it works so if you think trashing the three of us
is going to make you feel better think again The fact is you need us as
much as we need you to find Pierre So either we work together as a team or
we go our separate ways and I guarantee you that if we do go our separate
ways we ruin a better chance at not finding Pierre That way everybody
loses And I guess you can stay on your hate crusade forever

The four just stand around Titus and Lydia together Nannette by herself by
the car and Randy sitting on the floor of the phone booth

Titus (walking toward Randy)
Look theres no point in fighting right now youre both right lets just
get going for now

Cut to the soccer field

The kids arrive they walk onto the field its pitch dark

Lydia is holding on to Titus as tightly as she can Randy is walking ahead
of

the pack forging through the mist that has dropped to about ten feet above
their heads Nanette is closely following him never actually touching him
Suddenly a loud sound of metal churning erupts from the bleachers to the
right

Everyone stops dead in their tracks and turn to face the origin of the sound

Randy
whos there

No answer

Randy
I said whos there

They begin walking toward the bleachers Randy in front closely followed by
Nannette Lydia and Titus at the rear

Titus
Shit man I cant see damn thing

Randy
Shuut

Lydia
Hold me close

Titus reaches for her ass She gives him a look

Titus
What

The closer they get the more distinctly appear the staircase to the
bleachers They hear a constant grind in the distance

Randy
Stamper Stamper Is that you out there

Titus
This isnt funny man If youre trying to scare us its working Now can
you cut it out we think we know what happened a friend of ours is missing

Randy
Yeah Pierre You know the news kid

they approach the stairs and the sound gets louder and louder A cat jumps
off the bleachers onto Randy Randy falls back onto Nannette She throws
him

off herself and takes off running Everyone is yelling
Randy (gathering himself)
Its cool its cool it was a cat Are you sure it was a cat

Lydia(frantic and still alarmed)
What the hell do you mean it was a cat Are you sure it was a cat

Randy
Yeah look I said it was a fucking cat ok Now everyone just fucking chill
were acting like a bunch of freaking kids man Fuck

Nannette
Randy

Randy

Nannette
Randy

Randy

Nannette
Youre bleeding from youre head

Randy sits back and rubs his palm against his head he realizes that he has a
small gash on his forehead All four of them are sitting on the floor trying
to gather their thoughts Titus is lying flat on his back with his hands
under his head He starts laughing uncontrollably Lydia is on her knees
not

too far from him

Lydia
Are you laughing Is he laughing

Randy takes of his shirt and starts nursing his wound

Nannette(still in shock)
What the hell are you laughing at dude

Titus (still laughing)

You should have seen the expression on your face as you tried to move Randy
from on top of you Man that was some funny shit I mean I thought she was
going to lift you right off herself man

Nannette
Fuck you man thats not funny dude plus it aint quite like you were standing
strong MR

Titus (still laughing)
Man I never thought I would see that She straight picked you up and shit
Man that was some funny shit for real
Randy holding his hand over his head begins laughing slowly Then he bursts
into an equally loud laugh Lydia looks at Titus then at Randy and finally
at
Nannette she joins in the laughter Very soon all four of them are laughing
Titus keeps on laughing rolling side to side clasping his stomach He rolls
right rolls left rolls right again and there crouched over him is Noran
Stamp

Titus
Oh fuc

Stamp

Lydia lets out a high pitch yell Titus rolls back and sprawls to his hands
and feet backing up from stamp

Titus

Stamp
Kinda like how the cabby didnt hear his murderer either hun

Randy
What You think we whacked the cabby What are you saying man

Stamp
Chief inspector

Randy

Stamp
Chief inspector thats what you call me Chief inspector Not man

Titus
So why do you think we wanted too meet with you if indeed we did it

Stamp

The fact that you wanted to meet doesnt really mean anything Actually the
fact that youre done hiding behind your dad might help us shed some light on
the situation

Titus (furious)
Youve got something to say to me you better say it loud and clear

Stamp

Easy young man I dont take kindly to threats My advice to you is that
youd better take some of that hostility out of your voice before I begin to
take offense to your idle threats

Titus
Idle Threats What the fuck is he talking about

Randy
Easy everyone lets take it easy remember were trying to find out about
Pierre So lets all keep a cool head ok

Stamp looks at the group then turns to Randy

Stamp
So what do you guys know about the night the cab driver died

Randy looks at Titus and then at the girls and begins to tell the story to
stamp

Cut to

The four friends are on their way to the police precinct with the chief
inspector

Titus (whispering to Randy)

Titus (grabbing at the bars)

Randy breaks out laughing Officer Bryant walks toward him Right then
Titus begins laughing as well Bryant turns to look in his direction He
becomes furious Ina flash he swings his club at Titus hands The blow
is

so violent that it sends Titus crumbling to his feet in a shattering yell

Randy
Hey What the fuck

Officer Bryant blows the whistle on his neck and before long the rest of the
precinct is in the small cell area

Officer 1

What the hell is going on In here

Officer Bryant

through the bars

Randy

Officer Bryant

Officer2
I say we teach them a lesson

Officer Bryant
Sounds like a plan to me what do you say guys

The officers begin converging on the cell Randy steps back and flips one of
the mattresses over his friend and himself A wave of blue suites swarm the
little cell they are temporarily slowed down as Randy wildly swings his belt
at them buckle leading on

Randy
Comon motherfuckers its you and I Im swinging at yall and Im bout to
fuck somebody up Come on come on

This only wards off the mob for a short while very soon they begin
approaching him from the week side

Titus (getting back up on his feet)
Randy look out behind you

He turns around just in time to duck the down swing of the assailing officer
Scoops up and under leads with his left foot and sends a devastating right

hook that floors the cop Unfortunately that is not enough to stop the on
coming mob

Very soon Randy disappears under the pressure of the mob Titus tries to put

up some resistance but its in vain

Officer(coming from upstairs
Stamps back Stamps in the parking lot

The officers straighten up and drag the boys back upstairs The girls are in
shock looking at their battered and bruised boyfriends

Lydia(catching Titus)
What did you do to him

No answer Stamp walks in

Stamp (looking at the boys
What happened here

No answer The mob of officers simply go back to what they were doing as if
nothing happened

Cut to
Pierre (abruptly waking up)
What It bit m

Pierre looks around him and realizes that hes back in the guest room
He tries to stand up he clutches his head Its wrapped in bandage He
touches the back of his head Thats where the pain is from

Pierre
What the hell happened

Theres a mirror straight ahead Pierre tries to rise to his feet and make
it

to the mirror He almost falls His left foot seems unable to support him
He looks down and realizes that his foot is bandaged as well

Pierre

My foot the dogsno it was a stick Lloyd was trying to show it to him
when

I fellno it was the dogsI knows for sure the maze

He limps across the room grabs his jacket he looks under the bed for his
shoes Theyre not there He then decides to look in the closet and there
as he expected are his shoes He slips on the right shoe then tries the
left shoe on It does not fit

As he sits on the bed and starts taking the bandage off he hears in the
distance steps coming up the stairs Pierre begins to rush he doesnt want
whoever is coming up the stairs to meet him in the room Pierre is pulling
off the bandage he pulls too hard and causes his injury to reopen

Pierre
shit that hurt

he grabs his ankle for a little while and then stops taking off the remaining
bandage and forces his shoe on Hes grimacing He is hurting The steps
are drawing closer and Pierre looks at the window He limps over opens the
window there are shrubs that have escalated the length of the wall

Its night time and Pierre feels that he can make a go for it He leans over
the balcony railing hes leading his climb down with his right foot trying
his best to put the least pressure on his injured foot Very soon his whole
body is over the railing He starts to climb down leaning his entire weight
on his right foot then he extends his left foot Pierre tries to put the
least pressure on his injured leg He starts applying little pressure at
first and as he increases the amount of pressure his left foot begins to
shake

uncontrollably

Pierre steadies himself he appears to achieve his goal Pierre looks down
and
realizes that he is half way down the wall He looks up He reaches over
his
forehead with his arm to wipe the sweat of his face and at that moment he
feels a grasp Pierre looks up and it is the long tentacle like arm of
Aristide trying to pull him up

Pierre(almost losing his balance)
Ah Let go off me
Pierre tries to fight Aristide off but the latter has a firm grip on Pierres
jacket Pierre begins to gyrate violently the whole structure is shaking

Pierre
Let go mother fucker

Lloyd(leaning over the railing)
give me your hand What do you think youre doing

Pierre
Fuck you and fuck him too let go off me you weird fuck

Aristide is still pulling on the jacket his face however remains
expressionless Suddenly the sleeve of the jacket begins to rip and Pierre
finds himself falling backward to the ground Aristide is still holding on
to

the sleeve looking down at Pierre still expressionless Pierre falls about
ten feet knocking the wind out off him He lies on the ground immobile
Lloyd slaps Aristide on the shoulder signaling him to come on As the two
bodies retreat from the balcony Aristide still holding the sleeve in his
hand Pierre quickly jumps to his feet as if hed never fallen at all Hes
trying to make it to the gate in the near distance He can see trucks
driving

by They all seem to slow down as they reach the sharp curve in front of the
property Pierre picks up the pace of his limping run He is almost at the
gate Lloyd walks out hastily into the courtyard He looks left and right
then spots Pierre at the gate Lloyd starts running full speed trying to get
to Pierre before he shuts the gate behind himself

Lloyd(swinging his arms haphazardly)
Pierre Giinter stop Pierre Giinter stop now what do you think youre doing

Pierre doesnt respond He buys some time by shutting the massive gate
behind
himself He pushes the gate but its heavier than he thought Now he sees
Aristide coming up behind Lloyd He seems to be running in slow motion
Aristides giraffe like motion makes him look like he is moving ever so
slowly
but he is actually gaining ground on Lloyd Pierres in the distance still
pushing the massive gate The gate is almost shut behind him He sees
lights

in the distance they draw closer Its a truck

Pierre(running into the street)
Hey stop please stop

He waves the truck down the driver seems to be oblivious to Pierre

Driver(in truck barely missing Pierre)
What the hell

He swerves around Pierre Lloyd is at the gate he is trying to open up the
massive gates Pierre watches as the truck blows past him and screeches to a
halt Theres a sharp bend ahead and the driver who almost lost control of
his vehicle has to stop the truck to prevent it from flying off road Pierre
looks back at the gate He backtracks to the gate running pass Lloyd and
Aristide Hes running toward the truck

Lloyd is still unable to open the massive gate fast enough

Aristide with one arm begins pulling the massive gate open as though it were
a

mere wooden door

Pierres closer to the truck
The trucks engine begins to turn once more

The truck rolls back a little The brake lights come on

The front driver side wheel is stuck in mud The wheel spins The truck is
still stuck
The engine revs as the wheel spins once more This time the tire is
dislodged
The truck starts moving forward Pierre sets his gaze on the truck in the
distance Aristide and Lloyds press on to open the gate

The truck begins to make it out of the tight corner

It will take the big rig a little caution before it makes it out of the
curve

A few seconds later the rig picks up enough momentum to be back at full
stride again Pierres gaining ground on the big rig and the latter is
beginning to gain momentum At the same moment Aristide pulls the huge gate
open He appeared to be exhausted from his effort but Lloyd is not He
gives

chase Pierre keeps on running at full stride into the back of the truck
His body slams against the cargo door of the truck he feels the truck jolt
forward Theres no time Lloyd is closing in faster than the rig is climbing
the hill

Lloyd (running)
Where do you think youre going

Pierre prepares to up

He paces his steps and lunges forwards grabbing on to the chain latch on the
rear gate of the rig He hoists himself up onto the little ledge

Lloyds right upon the truck

He tries to reach for Pierres injured foot but barely missed him This
caused Lloyd to loose his balance and tumble forward onto the ground

Pierre(latched on to the truck)
what the hell do you want from me

No answer Aristide catches up with Lloyd to help him back up to his feet
Lloyd wants no help

The two men stand watching as the truck heads down hill Pierre looks back
at

the two men

The rig is now in full stride

As Lloyd gathered himself back up to his feet he watches as the light of the
rig fade away

Lloyd(walking back toward the manor)
Get the car

Aristide
But sire

Lloyd
Dont worry hes going no where Inform the others everything is still as
planned

Aristide
Yes sir

Cut to the precinct

Stamp
What the fuck happened here

No one answers

He turns to the girls

They look back at him and then without actually saying
glance at officer Bryant

Stamp (walking up on Bryant)

What happened

Before he can respond Titus speaks up barely able to s

Titus

a word direct their

tand on his own feet

Nothing happened man Just a little fight between my man here and I

Stamp (still looking directly at the rookie)
What do I look like You want to tell me you did that
can

to each other You

barely stand on your own two and you want to tell me that you beat the crap

out of each other

Titus
Thats what I fucking said OK Thats what happened

Stamp

Obviously you havent lost you tongue Good for you
it

Titus looks at Bryant and smiles

Titus
Ill see you soon

Bryant (walking up to Titus)
Is that a threat Because it sounds like one to me

They all walk out into the parking lot
Stamp approaches the group they walk away from him ins

Stamp
Surely you dont think that Im behind this now do you

Lydia
Where the fuck were you hu

We fought Now what

youre going to need

tead
Stamp(as Titus tried to hold Lydia back)

Hey you know what You stupid asses are really starting to get on my fucking
nerves here I have the mayor on my ass asking me for answers on two murders
in a span of 24 hours and all you fucking have to tell me is I got those
officers to rough you up

Titus tries to get a word in to no avail

Stamp

Do you have any idea when the last murder was committed in this town Do you
have any fucking idea No none of you have a fucking idea whats going on
here So shut the fuck up On top of that I have a missing or possibly
kidnapped student Now do have something to share with me or not

The crew stops to deliberate Pierre was still their primary focus

Titus
Were going to hit the main land and get Pierre

Stamp
That sounds like a great plan and everything but how do you hope to do that

Lydia(looking at Titus in question of his decision)
Yeah how exactly are WE going to get Pierre

Stamp
Well the police ferry is departing in half and hour for the mainland

Nannette
and

Titus
And were catching it with em

Nannette

Wait a minute What the hell is wrong with you You think you can throw
your

wait around and just decide whatever you want for the whole lot of us

after a lot more arguing among each other the crew decides to join Stamp and

a few of the other offers with him and head out to the mainland They all get
on the ferry and head out to the mainland

Act III
Cut to Mainland Cambridge Manor

Stamp and co touch down at Lloyds manor
Police cars driving into the compound Sirens are blaring and lights

Stamp (knocking)
Police open up
The curtain of one of the windows slightly opens up Aristide is looking
back

at the group of people at the door steps He draws the curtain shut

The door opens

Aristide
Good evening

Stamp
Were looking for two young men Lloyd Cambridge and Pierre Ginter

Aristide(standing in the door way)
Im afraid I do not know whom youre referring to

Stamp
You dont know whom Im referring to

Aristide
No I do know master Cambridge This is after all the Cambridge residence
Whom Im unaware of is the other gentleman you mentioned

Stamp
Gunter

Aristide
Right Gunter

Stamp (showing a picture)
Actually its Giinter not Gunter Anyhow you say you dont know him

Aristide(looking at Stamp instead of the picture)
No sir Im afraid I cannot recall that face

Stamp
Can we speak to Lloyd

Aristide (begins closing the door)

Master Cambridge is not able to attend to you right now He is a little
under

the weather Was there anything further

Cut to
The kids are standing in the distance watching the whole thing unfold Randy
is walking toward the maze The ground is disturbed

Lydia(looking at Aristide)
Thats him Thats the guy from the airport

Nannette

Lydia(pointing at Aristide)
The guy with Pierre and Lloyd at the airport thats him right there

Titus

Lydia(walking off toward Stamp)
Yesthats the guy

Titus (to Lydia)
Wait up Randy comon man

Randy (back tracking)
Yeah coming up

Cut to
Stamp (pushing the door)
Just a minute there this is police business

Aristide(opens the door and stands in the way)

Yes but of course and I am certain that once you have a warrant to search
the

premises you will be in the position to summon Master Cambridge from his ill
bed Until then gentlemen please clear the premises and have a good night

Stamp (reaching for his radio)
Alright boys lets clear this place Move out

Lydia(running up)
Thats the guy thats the guy Dont let him go

An officer stops her

Lydia
Let me go you asshole Thats the guy from the airport

Stamp (walking toward the officer and Lydia)
What the hell is going on now

Officer (restraining Lydia)
Shes going on about the butler

Nannette(running up and shoving the officer)
The guy she saw at the airport

Stamp
Hey cut it out officer let her go

Lydia
I saw him at the airport with Pierre and Lloyd

Stamp
He says hes never seen Pierre Ginter

Titus
And you believe him

Stamp
No but we dont have a search warrant so until we get one we cannot search
the premises

Lydia
So thats it Pierres in there and no one knows whats going on in there

Stamp (radio comes on)
Well theres not much we can do about that

Titus
What

Randy (walking up on the discussion)
Whats going on

Stamp walks off to take the call

Titus

Can you believe this Lydia saw that guy at the airport with Pierre and
Lloyd

but we cant search the fucking premises

Randy
How much you willing to bet that Pierres not here

Titus and the girls just look at him

Randy

Did you see those tire tracks when we came in Well get this I saw some
foot

prints by the maze back there

Titus

Randy
There were two sets of prints

Stamp (walking back toward the kids
Lets get out of here someone has a possible ID on your friends downtown
Around some club

anfare of noise and lights

the window Its not Aristide Stamp looks out of his side view mirror and
spots the figure

Aristide walks into the library He walks over to the cabinet and fixes
himself a drink Theres someone in the room He can tell for theres a
wheezing sound behind the door

Aristide (looking through the smoked mirror on the wall)

Theyre gone but I must reach the others before they uncover us

Lady Van-Ess comes out of the dark and nods her head
Cut to on the road

Officer Bryant is riding with Titus and Stamp Randy is riding with the
girls He hasnt said much since they got out of the precinct Lydia speaks
to him but he doesnt seem to understand a word of what shes saying He
keeps going back to the scene at the manor and picturing Aristide A sudden
jolt from a bump in the road and Randy snaps back to reality

Randy
Hun

Lydia
What

Randy
I though you said something

Lydia doesnt answer she just shakes her head no They are closing in on

the

city

The traffic begins to stagnate Theyre on the bridge Cars pass them
filled

with young people They are drunk and loud

Once they cross the bridge they realizes that it is going to be virtually
impossible to make it to the other end of the boulevard There is a club on
the corner and there is a massive crowd in front of the club The noise
level

is off the chart Traffic is going in all directions The officers turn on
their sirens The crowd is oblivious to the sirens After stalling for what

seems like an eternity Randy steps out of the second car

Officer
hey get back here Where are you going Hey Hey

Randy just keeps walking away Hes trying to make it to the club across the
street Its club DecaDance aka Double D the single largest club in
town

the place is packed with celebrities Someone bumps into Randy He clenches
his side a quick reminder of his still bruised ribs The rest of the kids
decide to get out of the police vehicles as well

Cut to

Pierre is walking in from the end of the alley He sees the crowd as well
unaware of what is going on As he approaches the main street he notices a
couple of officers Pierre rushes toward them As Pierre approaches he
realizes that the officers are holding some posters in their hands As one of
the officers makes a hand gesture Pierre catches a glimpse of the poster

He

vaguely reads the words wanted A couple of teenagers bump into the officer
as Pierre stands right up on the officers
Officer (dropping the posters
Hey watch were youre going kid and slow down

Kid(taking off running)
You watch were youre going asshole

The poster is on the ground Pierre takes one look at it and to his dismay
his picture is the one on the poster The officer turns toward the
teenagers

Pierre ceases the opportunity to turn toward the main street The other
officer grabs the kid before hes able to flee The argument escalates
between the youngsters and the officers This causes more officers to
converge on the scene Pierre sees a phone booth across the way he heads for
the booth He crosses the street weaving through cars Hes on the other
side He walks into the phone Across the street one of the officers
follows
Pierres movement He starts heading across the street as well

Officer
hey hey stop Hey guys isnt that the dude

No one is listening The officers are more concerned with controlling the
kids and in the mix of things they fail to hear the other officer From the
booth Pierre sees the persistent officer Hes making his way across the
street Suddenly the officer intercepts a colleague in from him pointing at
the poster and pointing over to the booth

Pierre

Pierre walks out of the booth He heads up to higher grounds streaming
through the crowd and still dodging the officers The officers are in
pursuit

and they are closing in Pierre maneuvers through the crowd and finds
himself

down another dark alley He hides behind a dumpster and waits for the
officers to flash their lights They flash their lights and hit the
dumpster

Officer1l
Let me go check it out
Right at that time they hear the crowd go wild another celebrity has arrived

Dispatch (voice over radio)
All the officers report to the front of the club

The two officers leave Pierre gets up from his hiding place He walks
toward the side entrance of the club
Bouncer

And where the fuck do you think youre going Mr

Pierre
Hey I was already in I just came out to take a leak you know long line in
there

Bouncer (pulling out a black light)
Let me see your hand

Pierre
What

Bouncer (grabbing Pierres arm)
I said let me see your arm

The bouncer scans Pierres arms

Bouncer
Wouldnt you do us both a favor and get outta here before I brake your face

Pierre
But listen

Bouncer (pushing Pierre)
Get the fuck out of here now Dont make me wrinkle my shirt on you

Pierre walks off but he sees a reporters van parked at the end of the
alley

Pierre manages to sneak into the van Inside he finds some media VIP
passes

Pierre dons the neck pass

Pierre(looking at his reflection)
Yeah thats what Im cut out for

Pierre hears some foot steps outside the van and before he can do anything
the van door swings open and before him stand three guys all looking back at
him

Guy1
What thewho you

Pierre walks out of the shadows
Guy2

Oh chill out dude hes one of the reporters Hey man No big deal man they
told us to come get some of the stuff out of the van

Guy1
Yeah I we didnt know that one of you guys was going to be out here and
all

The crowd noise from inside the club

Guy2
Comon lets hurry up and get all that stuff in before she starts tripping
again

The three guys start rushing to unload the rest of the material
Pierre
You guys need a hand

Guy2
Yeah sure Dont mind if you do

Pierre carries a tripod stand over his shoulder and walks into the club

He realizes that he is at the back stage Everything is going fast loud and
crazy Pierre drops the equipment and wonders off He makes his way around
a

dividing stage curtain Once around it he peaks only to see a frantic crowd
going wild and chanting for their idol

Pierre

Well well what do we have here

Pierre stays backstage waiting for things to settle down

Pierre slumps down on the wall

Hand lands on his shoulder

Pierre spins around fist clenched only to face a short fat man with arched
eye brows and frizzed hair that shields his receding hair line

Short guy

What the hell are you doing What the hell are you doing You think I paid
for you assholes so that you sit around and do nothing (Pierre tries to get
a word in to no avail) get up off youre ass and get to work

Pierre starts walking in the direction of the other employees
Pierre sees two officers walking around the back stage he panics and reaches
for some cable thats been laid on the ground

Short guy(stepping on the cable)
What the hell are you doing

Pierre(yanking the cable from underneath his foot)
Get off the damn cable man

Short guy
Do you know who youre talking to
Im Fabrice Fabien promoter exceptionnelle to the stars

Pierre

Thats great dude back off before you get hurt OK

Instead of slowing down Pierre picks up his pace and heads into a crevice
Fabrice runs after Pierre Pierre barely gets out of sight before the
officers make it to his former location They patrol the area for a short
while and head back to the front stage area

The performer is up on stage The crowd roars The officers are all around
the stage for the soul purpose of crowd control

Back stage
Pierres getting a face full from Fabrice
Fabrice

Im talking to you Mr Who brought you in which team are you with Are
you

tech support

Fabrice keeps on rambling Pierre ignores him Instead Pierre is looking
around He dumps the cable on the floor Fabrice reaches up and smacks
Pierre across the face

Pierre(slams Fabrice into the ply wood wall)
What the hell is wrong with you

Before the latter could say a word Pierre had slaps him twice exposing his
hair piece

Fabrice
Help help me someone please help me

No one can hear him due to the noise from the crowd
Suddenly the music stops between songs The cries for help reach the
officers on the others side of the stage curtain

Officer1l
Did you hear that

Officer2(on radio)
Disturbance at back stage locationen route to check Secure all exits and
alert chief

They head to the back stage Pierre sees the officers approaching

Officer2 (pointing at Pierre)
Stop

Pierre runs onto the front of the stage He walks onto the set The band is
playing The crowd is going wild The officers follow him

Officer
Come back here We just want to talk to you Dont do anything stupid

Pierre (backing up to the edge of the stage)
Youve got the wrong guy I didnt do anything It was in self defense

Officer
Just come closer get away from the edge

Pierre looks back hes at the edge of the stage

Singer
Jumpj umpj ump

The crowd below him put their arms up Pierre looks back at the officers
then at the crowd He dives into the crowd The crowd cheers loudly
carrying Pierre for a while before they drop him Pierre mingles through the
crowd and makes his exit to the rest rooms
Cut to Outside the club

Stamp(on the Radio)
Where Repeat thatlets go people someone spot your friend in the club

Titus
Comon lets go get him

Stamp walks up to the bouncer

Stamp (flashing badge)
Clear the way police business

The bouncer towering over Stamp refuses to budge

Yet another celebrity arrives and this time it is Randys turn to sneak in
with the celebritys entourage He is successfully in the club Lydia is
the

first to notice that Randy is in the club By the time she can point toward
him he disappears into the club

Stamp (answering a call

Did you hear what I said Get out of the way before I decide to shut down
this whole club

(he gets back on radio) Stamp He what How does a person disappear from
What

Stamp turns off his radio and turns to the bouncer

Stamp
Listen junior you have three seconds before I slap these cuffs on you

Bouncer (stepping up on Stamp poking him in chest)
How exactly do you plan on doing that old timer

In one deft move Stamp grabs the bouncers finger rotates inwardly causing
the bouncer to lose his balance Stamp spins in the opposite direction
This
jerks the bouncers body violently back toward Stamp Stamp strikes him on
the bridge of the nose The bouncer is floored

Stamp (straightening his overcoat)
Cuff him Ive got your old timer right here

Titus
Not bad old timer

Cut to The restroom

Pierre makes his way to the mens room As he forges ahead he can see the
top of the officers hat in the distance They know where hes heading and
worst of all theyre following suit Pierre enters the restroom

Pierre (pushing through)
Excuse me excuse me

He walks into one of the stalls The crowded bathroom quickly empties out as
the familiar voice of Fred Durst and Method Man echo through the entire club
Pierre opens the stalls door and walks out He opens the bathroom door but
he spots the two officers standing in front of the bathroom He looks around
and sees the exit sign pointing to at the rear of the club He heads for the
exit door Pierre forces the door open It wouldnt budge On the other
side of the door a couple of guys are leaning against the door

Pierre (pushing the door)
Hey move from the door

Guy on other side
Yo man move is some dude coming through

Guy leaning on door
Oh my bad

e door opens and Pierre exits at the same moment that the officers walk

a
fe

e rest room They hear the exit door shut They head toward the exit
ierres on the other side of the door This is the same hallway that leads
o the rest room except for the fact that it was at the end of the club and
ere was an exit door leading to a street alley Pierre tries to open the
oor to no avail

uy leaning on door

at the fuck you doing man Go through the front man that door is locked

SBoOaactkctuUdbtyH

Pierre doesnt answer He keeps pulling on the latch to open the door To
his
left is a steel black frame with a half table stuck to it

Guy leaning on door(feels a bump)
Hey who the fuck is that

Officers
Move from that door Police

Guy on the other side
Fuck you

Guy leaning o door
Yeah fuck you Lets block these mother fuckers in

Pierre (back to steel door)
Blockem in

Guy leaning on door(reaching for something in his pocket)
Come on dude

Pierre follows The guy slides a peg of some sort in a grove on the table
The structure shifts It opens into a room The guy pushes Pierre in
theres nothing in this room except for the another massive door directly
ahead of him

Pierre
Hello Hello

Pierre looks around him the walls are covered with velour Its bright
red The room is sound proof He turns toward the door that led into the
room The doors no longer there Instead it was an infinite stretch of
the same red velour wall

There are no door handles no door frames no nothing

Cut to The other side of the door
The guys let the door open

Officer1l
You think thats funny This is police business do you understand that

Guy leaning on wall
Hey man we didnt know who you were thats all

Officer2 (flashing picture)
You seen this guy back here

Guy leaning on wall(grab picture)
No sir never seen him

Cut to

Pierre banging on the same door that he had previously rushed into Nothing
Pierre hesitantly walks toward the door ahead

Pierre (knocking on door)
Is anyone here

He hears a sound Pierre looks up Theres a camera perched up on top of
the door Pierre looks up into the camera as it focused its lenses on him
Door clicks softly and the massive door shift slightly Pierre steps back
and
listens to some soft music and muffled sounds in the distance He walks into
toward the door Pierre extends his arm to the door The door opens
inwardly On the other side of the door is an exotic beauty barely dressed
in
an Arabian outfit freely exposing her breast She reaches out to Pierre
asking him for his hand Pierre does not extend his hand back at her She
smiles He looks around and reluctantly extends his hand back the lady
takes his hand and starts to lead him

Pierre (pulling back)

Just a minute there Where are we going Wheres this place What the fuck
is going on here

She doesnt speak She keeps smiling and extends her hand to him again
Pierre doesnt budge She walks off into a better lit room Pierre follows
cautiously In the room are more scantily clad women all looking more
gorgeous than the other

Lady
Please sit

He obliges her A spectacle is unfolding in front of him across the table
in

the booth a figure is looking back at him

Voice in the corner
Welcome Pierre Ginter

Pierre sits up Before he can move the dark figure moves toward the poor
light It is Lloyd

Cut to the club

Randy (walking up to one officer)
Where did you say you saw Pierre

The officers look at him as though hes insane

Officer
What Who are you

Randy tries to identify himself but before he can say a word the officers
get

a call and are asked to converge to the entrance of the club They leave
Randy where he stands Stamp and the rest finally make it in the club

Stamp
So where is he

Officer
Iwe dont know we followed him into the rest room and he came out through
the back exit and

Stamp
What what the hell is he talking about (turning to the other officer)

Officer2
Well see the crowdand

Stamp walks toward Randy and stares at Randy looks at him and shrugs his
shoulders pointing at the officers

Cut to The red room
Pierre is petrified looking at Lloyd

Lloyd
OK I think we got off on the wrong foot here Mr Giinter I dont know what
exactly happened to you back at the manor but never mind it gives me the
creeps also And I grew up there

Pierre still doesnt say a word Hes looking around

Lloyd continues his monologue Pierre is oblivious to what he says until a
girl slides across the booth bench and in one snakelike fluid motion Slides
under the table She disappears Lloyd slowly lets his head back The lady
is now bopping her head up and down between Lloyds laps Pierre now tunes
back into the conversation

Lloyd
So is that a yes Good

Pierre (shocked)

What

A lady slide over to his side Shes holding a drink The lady extends the
drink over to Pierre

Pierre
No thanks maam Now what were you saying

Another lady slips in behind the first girl and spreads her legs diving face
first between her legs Lloyd jolts from the chain reaction Pierre
suddenly

realizes that he is in the middle of some sort of orgy and Lloyd seems to be
the ring leader of the group Pierre notices weird inscriptions on the
walls

The girl next to him extends her arms over his neck and subsequently makes
contact with Pierres face with her breast The temperature in the room
drops
slightly Pierre sees her nipples constrict She rises in her seat She
grabs Pierres drink stirs her finger into his drink but he doesnt notice
The lady leans back and pours the drink down her chest The drink spills
onto
Pierres face Pierre is guzzling the drink and sucking on the hard nipple

Lloyd
Feeling it yet Mr Ginter

Pierre
What whats going on

Lloyd

Nothing you dont want to happen my friend See my dear Pierre I have a
few

things to show you and I need you to be open minded in order to understand
what we are doing here Come with me Mr Giinter please

Lloyd extends his hand to Pierre The latter looks around confused there is
a

slight glaze over his eyes Pierre follows Lloyd but he is being let by the
sultry lady that was with him As they walk the lady hands a chain over to
Pierre He grabs on to the chain with a questioning look on his face
Pierre

tugs on the chain only to find out that it is attached to the neck of the
very

lady that gave it to him Pierre lets go of the chain
Lloyd(placing the chain back in Pierres hand)
You hold on to that Dont let go

They exit the booth and start walking down a corridor At the end of the
corridor stand two men Giants in stature Both men are holding tall
staffed axes crossed to prevent anyone from entering As Lloyd approached
the
menacing looking men he extends both hands outwardly giving a sign to part
the

axes With that simple gesture the two monsters draw their axes back
Lloyd Pierre and the rest of their female entourage walk in the sight is
ungodly Two steps lead down and in an area which seems like a furnished
pool what seems like a ton of people are part taking in an orgy Men
women

drugs sex everywhere Pierre looks on confused Lloyd leads him down the
stairs into the mélée Pierre is immediately met with female hands reaching
for him He slows down and turns to a woman seemingly needing some
attention

Pierre stops and looks back at the lady with whom he is She approves of
his

interaction with the needy lady Pierre drops to his knees and starts
kissing

this total stranger passionately

Lloyd(pulling Pierre up)
Lets not waste our time here Come

Pierre (resistingslurred speech)
No I want to stay here

Lloyd
I have something better in stock for you Something I know that you would
like Trust me I know your style

Pierre (following reluctantly)
My style what the hell is my style

Lloyd(winking at Pierre)
Trust me

Pierre reluctantly picks up and follows Lloyd They keep on forging ahead
through the orgy crowd until they reach another set of stairs leading back up
and out of the pool

At the top of these stairs are two more guards identical to the first two
guards Lloyd makes the same hand gesture and the two guards part their
staffed axes as did the first two

Lloyd leads the rest through this area they walk into another corridor In
this corridor however there are curtains on either side of the hallway

Noises coming from behind the curtains

Lloyd(to Pierre)
Easy there Mr

Pierre (stops)
What the hell is going on in here

Lloyd draws one of the curtains back

A man bent over on his knees He appears to be in pain Behind him stands a
lady clad in a tight leather corsage and a steel studded collar The man is
in tears and he looks back to the Amazon lady She stands well over six foot
five inches and is built like an athlete

Pierre follows her long legs and at the end of that leg that seem to go on
for

ever is a six inch stiletto ankle high boot Her other leg is perched on the
back of the man on his knees The man is in pain because of the heel

Lloyd(pointing at the foot of the Amazon)
Look

Pierre realizes that the heel is not digging into the back of the man its
deep in his rectum the pain only intensifies as the Amazon dominatrix churns
her foot deeper into the mans hind side

Amazon
How would you like to see yourself cry

Pierre looks back at Lloyd Lloyd only smiles and walks off

Pierre
Hey you going to help that guy or what

Lloyd

Tell me Mr Ginter did you see any shackles on that gentleman What makes
you think that he wanted to be rescued as you so well put it

Pierre (looking back)

But

Lloyd

But but what No one could enjoy that Well you make a point there my
good

man see Im not one for all that pain either but you see one mans poison is
another man pleasure

Lloyd reaches over to the lady following him and tugs on a chain between her
legs

Lloyd
Isnt that right dear

The lady does not respond

Lloyd(pulling harder)
Isnt that right

A muffled cry comes out of the woman Shes in pain but she likes it

Pierre
OK I get it thats enough hey cut it out man

Lloyd(getting loud)
How do you know when its too much What makes you think that you understand
pain and sacrifice Tell me Mr Ginter

Lloyd reaches up and grabs her nipple rings and pulls them as well She
suddenly begins to shake and shudder uncontrollably right before Pierre

Pierre (rushing to her side)
Somethings wrong

Lloyd(letting her fall)
No nothing is wrong Everything is bliss

Pierre crouches next to her She smiles back at him beads of sweat on her
forehead Pierre realizes whats happening Lloyd never stops walking
away

Pierre
Hey we cant just leave her here

Lloyd
Why not And besides shes in good hands She is where she wants to be

Pierre turns around and sees hands reach from underneath one of the curtains
and pull the ladys limp body into the booth

Lloyd
Dont worry Mr Giinter we are almost at our destination

Cut to

Stamp
I want you to seal the perimeter I dont want anyone leaving this club till
I say its OK

Officer

Cut to

Lloyd and Pierre and the remaining two girls have reached the end of the
corridor At the end of this corridor however is a massive bronze double
gate Lloyd walks up to them and knocks on the doors a window similar to the
one that was at the main entrance opens

Lloyd(walking up to window)
Cambridge

The doors open Lloyd unhooks the chain on his companions neck Pierre
mimics his gesture and frees his companion as well Lloyd then leads the way
for Pierre who hesitantly follows As they walk in Pierre takes a while to
adjust his eyes to the scene given the fact that there are no actual lights
in
this room save a ton of candles Pierre adjusts his sight to the poor light
Theres a woman laid out on an inverted flat bed with an Indian collar
round
er neck The heat from the room slowly but surely causes the collar to

rink further and further causing the woman to suffocate in the mean time
ehind her stands a man with an unusual tool which he is churning

eres a faint cry from the bound lady It is muffled by the chocker on her
eck

DpHOAD®D

Pierre
What the fuck

The man is winding a lever connected to a massive phallus This phallus
has

the lady spread eagle and at the brink of tearing Pierre looked to Lloyd
for

an explanation The more the man churns the more pronounced her moaning is
A crowd slowly begins gathering around the table Shes turning pale Her
eyes blood shot red are almost gouging out of their sockets

Pierre (whispering)
Hey do something Shes gonna die Do something damn it

He tries to intervene but Lloyd restrains him
Lloyd(holding Pierre)
Just stay put my friend watch like the others Trust me

Pierre looks around the room It seemed as if everyone else is in a trance
thoroughly enjoying the scene

The man has almost reached a stop in his grinding motion

The victim lies there immobile

Her tongue sticking out

The crowd begins to converge upon her
The crowd is rubbing her body
A lady leans over and locks her lips on one nipple
Lloyd move over to the head of the lady and feeds her opened mouth his penis

He reaches for a blade and starts moving toward her neck

Pierre
No dont

Lloyd cuts the leather chocker The crowd cheers

The lady who was kneading the victims breast is herself being ravaged by a

midget his face buried deep in her ass And then just as it slowly began

it

all comes to an abrupt end Lloyd tenses up and ejaculates Lloyd staggers
back and falls in a chair

Pierre approaches the body slowly

There is a little bit of blood on the ladys nipple

Pierre (rushing Lloyd)
What the fuck do you think youre doing

Lloyd(still in a daze)
What do you mean Mr Guunter

Pierre(walks up to him)
Shes dead And youre going down for that(turns to face the crowd)
youre all going downyou hear me

Lloyd(rising out of his seat)

Going down for what Having sex Please look around you were all
consenting adults here Besides theres no law against this or is there
Mrs Chief justice (he points to the body)

Pierre turns The lady is sitting up He moves along the body and places
two

fingers on the ladys neck to see if there is a pulse just at that moment
she

bites his finger

Pierre(falling back
What the fuck

The crowd starts clapping
Mrs Chief Justice(rubbing her neck)

Youre quite right Cambridge Ive always told you that youd make a better
lawyer than doctor

Lloyd(walking up to Pierre)
Meet Mr Guunter

MrsCJ(wiping her mouth)
Is he one of us

Lloyd
He is one to be
Pierre (walking up in shock)

You knew what was going on What the fuck is wrong with you people Are you

hysterically) What fuck

The crowd begins to converge on him

MrsCJ(to Lloyd)

Pierre
One of who Who the hell is Us

Lloyd
I never said that he was one of us

Pierre

Lloyd

crowd is not moving

Titus (signaling)

Randy (from balcony)

He can see Titus Aristide sees officers ahead

Aristide (staging panick)

The officers head in the opposite direction Aristide takes another exit
They run into Titus

Titus (running toward them)

Titus (back stepping)
What Youre letting him get away What the fuck are you doing

Officer2(on radio)
Officers requesting back up were got the suspect

Titus (trying to run past them)

The officers wrestle Titus down to the ground He tries to toss one officer
off himself but to no avail Titus reaches for the officers night stick and
brandishes the weapon The officer starts spraying

Titus (swinging the night stick)
Ahhh What the

The officer wobbles off barely conscious

Officer2 (reaching for something)

Stamp steps in just in time to prevent the officer from attacking Other
officers arrive at the scene

Stamp
Stop every body stop What the hell is going on Where is the butler

Officer2

headed back this way to stop the kid

Titus(finally getting back up to his feet)
You fucking moron you couldnt catch a cold if it was handed to you
Officer

Stamp(slamming the officer against the wall

OK enough I said ENOUGH Now you two go back there and try to locate the
butler The rest of you (Pointing at the other officers) seal all exits
Nothing leaves this building not till I say so

MPD Please remain calm The festivities are going to have to come to an
end

calm

The crowd is mute

Voice out of the crowd
FUCK YOU

A bottle comes flying onto the stage The crowd goes wild and starts tossing
tables and chairs

They start fighting the officers

The rest of the police force converges on the crowd trying to hold them back

Stamps tackled to the ground
Its Titus pulling him out of harms way A chair flew right past Stamps
head

Titus(on Stamp)
Come on lets all go backstage before we get hurt
Cut to

Randys following Aristide over looking him from the top of the club Randy
watches Aristides every move through the crowd

Aristide moves toward the back exit As soon as he makes it there he
reaches

for the mirror on the wall

Officer Bryant (coming around the corner)
Hey you there Turn around slowly

Aristide quickens his movement Randy is watching the whole thing from the
top

Officer Bryant (reaching for side arm)
I said turn around slowly with your hands up

Aristide (turning)
Easy there young lad the guy youre looking for is back there at the
backstage area
Officer Bryant
You just step away from that mirror and keep your hands where I can see them

Aristide (moving closer)
Im telling you youre making a sad mistake

Officer Bryant (stepping back
OK thats close enough I said thats close enough

Aristide (lowering his arms)
Why dont you put down your weapon Im not whom youre really after and you
know it

Officer Bryant(on radio)
Officer requesting backup

Radio

Aristide points over officer Bryants shoulder

Officer Bryant
What You expect me to turn

Randy (from top)

Officer Bryant backs up into someone He turns around Three men face him
They holding weapons They start clobbering the officer

Randy
No

Aristide (pointing at Randy)
Get him

Aristide turns and heads back toward the mirror One of the assailants
starts

escalating the massive drapery heading for the balcony Randy steps back in
the balcony booth The others are beating down the officer

Randy (leaping from the balcony)
Stop

Radio
Officer what is your location Come in officer Officer come in

the radio is lying on the ground a splash of blood falls on it Aristide
turns around and draws a sword from the cane that hes carrying Randy falls
on the two thugs They all hit the deck one is knocked out on impact The
other is slowly getting back up to his feet Randy clutching his side
stands between the thug and the officer Hes facing the assailant

Randy (back to Aristide)
Come onyou and me

The officer is in the background coughing up blood The thug steps on the
radio with a bloody boot smashing the device Randy capitalizes on his
distraction and kicks him Randy fails to see Aristide approaching from
behind with his sword drawn The other thug is back on the ground Randy
turns to face him At the same moment he catches officer Bryant who
collapses

in his arms The latter eyes are rolled back he clings onto Randy Randy
looks over him and sees Aristide drawing his sword out of officer Bryant

Randy
No

The other thug blind sides Randy Aristide runs back toward the mirror
Before randy can gather himself the thug brandishes a vase over his head
readying to smash it over Randys head

Stamps voice
Drop it

Two shots are fires The thug stands balancing himself for a little while
One more shot is fired He falls back Stamp and the rest of the crew
converge over Randy and officer Bryant From the ground Randy can see
through all the feet shuffling before him He sees the entry way shut

Cut to The shrine

Pierre awakes Pierres eyes can barely focus He feels a strain on his
shoulders Pierre is barely coming around He begins to make out various
sounds His vision is slowly coming back into focus Pierre opens his eyes
to the crowd before him Before him is a banquet table adorned with food
Lloyd
is sitting at the head Everything vividly flashes back to Pierre He
realizes that hes looking back at Lloyd from an elevated position Pierre
turns and looks up His arms are strapped stretched wide apart as are his
feet which are resting on individual ledges Pierre is on a crucifix
Furthermore hes only wearing a loin cloth

Lloyd
Mr Giinter how reverend of you to join us

Lloyd

Mr Giinter we are gathered here in your honor You see we belong to a
special community of affluent personalities as you can tell but our how can
I say this sexual orientation is apparently not acceptable in the eyes of
society Actually our kind is not acceptable in society (Lloyds voice
gets louder and louder) and do you have any idea why Can you tell me why
Every one wants to be aloud to do as well as they please Freedom of choice
is what they call it Why cant we do what we want Tell me why

Lloyd drives his fist onto the banquet table Pierre tries to speak but hes
bound by a mouth piece Making it impossible for him to speak He muffled
some words out

Lloyd
Were you trying to tell me something Someone please take off his gag
Please after all he is our guest of honor Besides no one could possibly
hear him

Lloyd snaps his fingers and one of the guards releases Pierres gag

Pierre
What the fuck are you doing What do you want from me What have I done to
you

Lloyd

See I thought you were one of us at first At least I thought you had what
it took be one of us You see the fact of the matter is I knew about the
incident in the morgue If you recall that night when you came back to the
room you were making fun of me because I was doing my laundry thing which
you

found totally unusual especially giving the time of night that it was

Pierre
I recall now the first time I made it to the room you were not there I
called Romuald to come get his keys You walked in with that laundry basket

Lloyd

Ah yes the laundry basket that was where my bloody clothes were You see I
had an unexpected interruption while I was busy attending to one of the
ladies

in the morgue And you see that was when that cab driver walked in on me
He

had to die

Pierre shocked entire murder scene reenacted without colour except for blood

Lloyd
You seem in shock and I wonder why after all you kill someone as
wellcemember

Pierre
ID

Lloyd

You what You did kill OToole didnt you But dont feel so bad my dear
the truth is I was on my way to the morgue to take him out but by the time I
got there the old gizzard was starting to deviate from the plan and I was
getting worried He was going to talk to the police and so I was going to
take care of him myselfyou remember those mysterious corpses disappearing
from the campus morgue dont you Well Liam was our inside man See he was
behind all those disappearances Anyway long story short I was going to
rectify our problemBut there you wereactually I thought your friends were
going to take care of him but then they lacked the finishing ability that you
have

Pierre
It was an accident What do you want from me I never meant to kill him
What do you want with me

Lloyd
Ah the burning question Well at one point I thought that you might want to
join us but I believe you saw too much in too little time at the manor

Pierre
I wasnt dreaming Was I I did see the dogs in the maze didnt I What
was that Who are you Who are all you people

Aristides voice(from behind Pierre)

What are we would be a more deserving question to whichs answer I would
say

we are the darkness from whence one came

Pierre (trying to turn his head the best he could)
Show yourself

Aristide walks around from the back of the room wearing a cloak like the rest
but unlike the rest his cloak is red in color and on his chest is a brand of
some sort

Aristide
Identify myself I am the high priest and these are my loyal subjects And
you are our sacrificial lamb prepare to give your life for a worthy cause

With those words resounding the others began dancing as though they were in
a

trance The music gets louder The orgy resumes With one arm gesture
Aristide signaled and the banquet table split open emitting a foul stench
Bodies are popping out of the apparent tomb Aristide reaches into the pool
of corpses and grabs an arm and pulls the arm dislodged itself from the rest
of the corpse Aristide raised the arm and passed it over a flame for a
while

and takes a bite out of the limb Pierres nauseous from the scene He
throws up spewing his vomit over the bed of corpses the subjects seeing him
do this scramble into the pool and begin scooping up Pierres vomit The
entire scene is unreal Aristide raises his arm to speak

Cut to The mirror

Randy crawls his way to the table where Aristide was last seen At the same
time the three thugs are subdued Stamp comes over to Randy

Stamp
What are you doing

Randy doesnt answer He just goes on tracing around the table fixture on
the
wall He tries to jerk it forward No result The table doesnt budge

Titus
Hey man we got to go dude What are you doing

Solonzo
Listen Bannerman we need to move

Randy signals him to be quiet Titus approaches his friend Randy runs his
hand at the bottom of the door

Randy
Where did the butler go Did anyone see him disappear in the course of the
fight

Stamp (looking around)
OK Surely youre not suggestingThe table

Randy
Theres something weird about this table See (he runs his hand on the
floor) there is a gap here Its like theres a door right here

They all converge on the opening and start tracing out a door frame

Nannette
OK theres a door so what now How do you open it

Randy doesnt answer he keeps feeling around the table but his effort fail
to
yield results Stamp grows impatient

Stamp
Is there a way to get in there or not

Randy
I dont know Im trying to find a way in

Romuald
Is Pierre in there

Randy
I dont know but do know that the butler went behind the door and if we can
get to him we can find out where Pierre is

Lydia
Well lets open this thing then

Stamp
Get me a ram now Time is of the essence and I dont have much time to spare
so lets knock this thing down and get on with it

The officers radio for a battery ram Few minutes later the ram was at the
door site

Officer
Step back we going to knock this thing down

Cut to The shrine

Lloyd stopped dead in his tracks He signaled the rest to be quiet They
eventually start catching on

Lloyd
Quiet quiet do you hear that

Aristide spins around with a look of disgust on his face You can hear a
thumping sound coming from the main entrance
Aristide
We must hurry my dear friends for the non believers are at our door We
must
cleanse our selves before long Lets prepare the sacrificial lamb

With that the crucifix is cast over the pool of corpses Then a sudden turn
away from the pool The massive bodyguards snap his restraints leaving his
body to drop to the floor Pierres free from his bounds The two guards
pull Pierre up to his feet Hes unable to stand on his own

Aristide
Look at me lamb the time is here and now Lay him on the altar

Pierre tries to struggle free from the guards but they clearly over power him
and lay him down on an altar table Pierres body falls into a grove carved
in the shape of a man The thumping on the door becomes louder Pierres
body is strapped securely onto the altar He can hear a faint sound Pierre
turns helplessly only to see an infant in a crib lying on the floor Mrs
Chief Justice approaches the infant She picks up the crib in which the
child

is and walks up to the altar Once there she lays the baby underneath the
altar

Pierre
Whats going on What are you doing

Lady
The future leader of our order must be reborn in blood He must be reborn as
the lambs life passes the new lord life begins

Pierre
Why use me Im no body I have nothing to do with you guys Please let me
go

Lady
All the contrary my dear friend you are as integral to this as none other

Pierre
Why How

At that very moment the thump on the door echoed one more time
Cut to Charge in

Stamp(standing at the smashed down door brandishing his weapon and waving
the

other in)

Lets go go go go

Officers dash in running in all directions The noise suddenly stops
everyone is looking around The room is empty safe a massive black metal
door A couple of officers head over to the door and start banging on it
Their efforts are without reward The door does not budge They summon the
battery ram But this is no task for the ram They bring in the explosives
and after they clear the room a detonation sends the metal door flying The
assault resumes and the officers storm through the same areas that Pierre had
been taken to They barge in on all sorts erotic activities As they search
for Pierre Stamp orders the arrest of the people involved in the elicit
interactions

Titus (leading the pack
Pierre Pierre any signs of him yet

Titus gets no answer from his query Randy still grabbing his ribs forges
on

as if he knew that his counterpart would not be where the others were
looking

Cut to The shrine

Guard(running to Aristide)
They are in the first chamber we must leave at once

Aristide
Hold them back we must complete the ritual at all cost

Lloyd
We cannot take that risk Do you realize whos out there The

Aristide(running up the altar)

Yes I do realize who is out there Those are your counterparts whom you
failed to eliminate and who traced you back to the manor Lady Van Ess is
preparing at the manor for our arrival I dont suggest we delay any
furtherfor your own well being that is

With those words Lloyd follows Aristide up the stairs they stand over
Pierre
Aristide frantically started spreading some sort of oil on Pierres forehead
Pierre battles with Aristide all through the ritualistic preparation
Pierre
hears the noise from the other chambers approaching his location At the
same
time Lloyd starts writing some inscriptions on Pierres chest Aristide
seems
to be losing his grasp of the situation He drops the brush that hes using
to write the inscriptions on Pierre Aristide bends down to pick up the
brush
at that very moment Pierre begins crying out loud for help Both Lloyd and
Aristide scramble back to the altar in an attempt to silence Pierre Lloyd
covers Pierres mouth with his hand The latter bites him and resumes his
cry
for help Aristide strikes Pierre on the face rattling the latters jaw
This temporarily silences Pierre

Cut to The charge

Randy (with his finger over his mouth)
quiet do you hear that

No one responds They all stand still quiet trying to make out what Randys
talking about Suddenly a muffled but distinct sound comes from the chamber
ahead Randy starts running in the direction of the sound Titus and the
girls follow him
Stamp
Wait what are you doing Wait for back up

The crew never slows down Stamp rallies the officers to his location

Cut to The shrine

Aristide

This could have been a noble act on your behalf but I realize that you are
not

willing to participate so I dont have a choice except to do what I have to

Lloyd is on his way over to assist Aristide He stops Theres a crashing
sound from the outside door Lloyd Aristide and the others turn and face
the

door

Aristide(to guards)
Block the entry Do not let them in

No sooner do they make it to the door does the latter come crashing down and
in rush Randy and the others Panic spreads across the room The guards
tackle some of the officers but the boys in blue outmatch the guards Very
soon their resistance is brought down In the mean time Pierres lying on
the altar table Standing over him is Aristide holding an ancient weapon
Pierre is still screaming for help

Officer(aiming at Aristide)
Stop drop your weapon

Aristide does not respond Gun shot Aristide drops to the ground The
officer is holding his hand gun with smoke coming out of the barrel Randy
dashes to the altar picks up the weapon from the floor He starts cutting
the restraints from Pierre

Randy

Hey you alright

Pierre (shockedé laughing)

Bannerman Never thought Id say this good to see you

Titus comes running to help Randy stand their friend

Titus (pointing at the pool)
What the fuck is that smell What the fuck is that

They stand of either sides of Pierre and carry him of the table Pierre is
trying to walk the best he can

Pierre(jerks his body up and violently falls back)
Ahh

Hes been slashed across the back by Mrs CJ His blood splashes across the
altar and the walls Randy turns around He barely dodges the blade of the
boomerang shaped knife Mrs CJ is swinging the knife violently at Randy
he
backs up and runs into Titus

Mrs CJ
Die you unbelievers Die

She jumps on Randy he tries to hold her up but he loses his balance in the
process Randy falls back on Titus Shes on top of him All three of them
hit the ground hard Randy prevents the blade from driving into his eye
Mrs CJ bares down her weight on the weapon Shes screaming they both
struggle Randy tilts his head to the right and dodges the plunging knife in
the nick of time He tosses her off himself Randy gets up and squares up
against her She charges on Out of no where a close line that almost
decapitates her Its Nannette shes holding one of the guards staffs She
drops the staff and rushes to Randys aid No sooner is Nannette next to
Randy does Mrs CJ jump back to her feet and resume her attack Nannette
spins around reaches for the staff wedges it in the corner projecting it
toward the assailant Mrs CJ takes flight She falls on the staff
impaling

herself She gyrates violently with her blood spilling over Nannette and
Randy She swings her weapon one last time before dropping it to the ground

Nannette (holding staff)

Oh no no

The assailant stares back at her lifelessly
Randy (scrambling to his feet)

Are you OK Nette are you OK

Nannette (expressionless)
Yesyes

Randy (pulling the staff out of her hands)

Its OK Its OK (yelling to others)somebody help Stay here Im going
to
go check on PierrePierre Pierre

Randy looks in Tituss direction but the latter is out He looks back at
the

altar Aristide is on the ground crawling toward Pierres body Randy
crawls

on the ground toward the altar as well He makes it up the first step
Aristide is closing in on Pierre Randy makes it up the second stair
Aristide is now lying next to Pierre he reaches in his pocket for a knife
Randy can see whats going on but hes still one stair away from doing
anything He looks back at Nannette but shes frozen stiff still in shock
from what happened Randy quickly turns to Titus The latter seems to be
finally coming around but not soon enough In a desperate effort Randy
leaps

up to stop Aristide Aristide on the other hand is getting ready to slash
Pierre from ear to ear
Randy
Stop

Randy stretches and grabs Aristides hand before Aristide is able to slash
his

friends throat Pierre is cut again this time on the neck and hes
bleeding Randy and Aristide are wrestling on the ground

A cry from Nannette

Randy turns and sees Lloyd holding Nannette by her hair with a knife to her
throat

Lloyd
Get off of him Or its her neck

Randy
Dont do it man let her go

Lloyd pulls her hair further exposing Nannettes neck Randy is still holing
on to Aristides arm Randy looks back at Lloyd and Nannette he looks over
Lloyds shoulder one of the officers is coming up on Lloyd from behind
Randy winks an eye at Nannette and turns to Aristide Lloyd gets ready to
plunge the knife into Nannettes chest As soon as he lifts his arm
Nannette

strikes him in the stomach hes slightly disoriented the officer jumps on
Lloyd from behind Lloyd swerves the officer Nannette tries to run off
Randy is still wrestling with Aristide Titus doesnt know who to assist
Randy or Nannette and the officer Aristide over powers Randy and gets on
top

of him Randy wedges his feet under Aristide and pushes as hard as he can
sending Aristide falling backward down the stair As Aristides tumbling
body

comes to a stop at the bottom of the stairs Hes lifeless Titus comes
over

and turns the limp body Aristide broke his neck on the stairs Lloyd is
still battling the officer He breaks away from the officer and starts
heading fro Nannette He picks up a club and tries to strike her with the
weapon Titus steps in He covers Nannette Titus turns around only to
meet
another strike to the face this time He is shaken

Stamps voice
Drop it

Lloyd stops with his hands above his head still holding on to the club He
pauses and turns slowly to see Stamp and a few other officers holding their
weapons pointing at him Lloyd turns back around and violently strikes Titus
one more time before being brought down by the thundering sound of several
gun

shots Lloyd hits the ground with a smile on his face falling into Titus
laps

Cut to Epilogue

There are ambulances every where some paramedics are working on Pierre
Hes

going to make it Randy is banged up and hes leaning on Nannette just as
Titus is leaning on Lydia The friends all follow the stretcher carrying
Pierre They all get aboard the ambulance watching as the other members of
the cult are being hauled onto the police wagon

Three stretchers are brought out with body bags on them The three bodies

are

Lloyd Mrs CJ and officer Bryant Pierre starts to speak his voice is

faint The paramedic urges him to relax and sleep but Pierre is insistent

pointing at his friends

Romuald

While theyre trying to figure out what Pierres talking about The
ambulance

starts moving toward the hospital All the officers are looking around
trying

to locate the so called baby There was no sign of this baby
Cut to The Manor

The manors as quiet as ever Lady Van Ess is standing by the fireplace
Shes motionless looking into the fire In the distance the distinct sound
of some foot steps draw nearer and nearer to the sitting room in which Lady
Van Ess is awaiting by the fireplace As the steps draw closer she

spin her wheelchair around and in the door way stands Aristide and hes
holding an infant in his arms A smile comes across Lady Van Ess face
