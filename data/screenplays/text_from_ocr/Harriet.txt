Story by
Gregory Allen Howard
EXT ARMY ENCAMPMENT - SOUTH CAROLINA - NIGHT
100 BLACK UNION SOLDIERS are assembled bayonets pointed at
the starry sky A legend tells us this is

South Carolina 1863 - Two years into the Civil War

A small black woman HARRIET TUBMAN 40 addresses the
troops We hear her before we see her

HARRIET
Suppose there’s a snake coiled at your
feet and it shoots up to bite you

We catch glimpses of her through their bodies as she paces in
front of them Her plain face with its habitual scowl her
eyes alive with passion

HARRIET (CONTD)
Folks get scared and send for a doctor to
cut out the bite But the snake he
rolled up there and while the doctor
cutting he bites you again in a new
place this time The doctor makes
another cut the snake spring up and
bites again Finally you realize the
snake ain’t gon’ stop til someone kills
him

A white commanding officer COLONEL MONTGOMERY watches
intently as Harriet continues

HARRIET (CONTD)
Slavery is still alive Those rice
fields downriver are feeding Rebel
troops with the toil of a thousand
slaves still in bondage Our mission is
to free those slaves We’ve waited
years to be allowed to fight in this war
against our own enslavement And it will
not be won without us Now is our time
Are you ready to kill the snake

The men shout YES their eyes fierce emotional
Harriet nods in approval As we watch she retreats into
herself as if listening to inner music or voices we can’t

hear INSECTS CHIRP in an eerie chorus taking us into

FLASHBACK VISION A SERIES OF IMAGES - monochromatic out of
sync and nightmarish -
EXT BRODESS FARM - FLASHBACKVISION

TWO YOUNG BLACK WOMEN in their early twenties LINAH AND
SOPH faces twisted anguish as they are ripped away from
their family at gunpoint by WHITE MEN and dragged to a
Slavers carriage where other SLAVES are shackled Their
mother RIT wails in grief as--

HORSESS HOOVES pound carrying them away their expressions
of despair seared into our memory The chorus of insects
grows louder until it becomes overwhelming like every
insect chirping at once We hear A VOICE eerily present
otherworldly MINTY

SLOW FADE IN

EXT BRODESS FARM - BUCKTOWN MD - CLOVER PATCH - DAY

He holds it above her head Minty jumps into his arms He
checks to make sure no one’s looking and then spins her
kissing her deeply A stolen moment

REVEREND GREEN
I leave you today with these words from

earthly masters in everything and do it
not only when their eye is on you and to
curry their favor but with sincerity of

heart and reverence for the Lord” Amen
SLAVES

Amen
BRODESS

Amen Thank you Reverend Green for
those wise words

(to the slaves)
You folks enjoy your Sunday Cook has
gravy for your cornpone tonight

As Green moves off and the slaves disperse
ON MINTY - still praying forefingers pressed to the dent in
her forehead John nudges her She slowly comes back to the

present catching Ben’s eyes

The Ross family confers briefly with furtive glances to the
whites on the veranda

ROBERT

( )
MINTY

ROBERT

Rit stops him a hand to his chest

RIT

Robert’s wife MARY waits for him anxiously Reluctantly he
joins her and his brothers heading back to the cabins as
Minty John and Ben peel away from the others and approach
the veranda of the house

Brodess looks up at them perplexed

BEN
Massa Brodess can we git a word

EXT BRODESS HOUSE - VERANDA - CONTINUOUS

Brodess waves them forward John Ben and Minty step onto
the veranda Rit stands back keeping her distance Eliza
looks on from the doorway Gideon leans against a pillar
arms crossed eyes on Minty She trembles as Ben steps up
hat in his hand

BEN
Massa Brodess I think you know Minty’s
husband John who works with me over at
Thompson Mill

BRODESS
Course I know him I let him marry her
What’s your point

JOHN
Suh me and Minty we thinking bout

Brodess barks a laugh looking from John to Ben
BRODESS

You hired a lawyer Ben what the hell

( )
BEN

wishes of your great-grandfather Atthow
Pattison He gave my wife Rit to your
mama as a chil’ but she s’posed to be
freed at 45 She 57 Rit always knowed

Brodess is quietly irate He turns to his wife

BRODESS

John pulls out the letter

JOHN
Got a letter from the lawyer suh He
say it’s clear - your great-granddaddy

Brodess snatches the letter from John glaring at Minty

BRODESS
How you know Minty You learn to read

MINTY
No suh John read it to me

Brodess glares at John and then puts on his glasses and
reads He looks up at them

BRODESS
How you niggers save enough to pay a
lawyer in the first place

BEN

I worked some extra hours for Thompson
Took near two year

( )
Eliza looks from Ben and John to Minty outraged

ELIZA
You have the gall to stand here and tell
us you been plotting against us for two
years

Brodess tears up the letter The blacks are stricken He
balls up the torn paper and tosses it to Gideon

BRODESS
Make her eat it

Gideon takes a hold of Minty’s face and forces the paper in
her mouth Their eyes meet as she gags

BRODESS (CONTD)

(to Minty)
Now you listen here girl Your daddy
may be free and your husband too but you
and your mama your brothers and sisters -
belong to me for life Your babies will
belong to me and their babies TO USE OR
SELL AS ME AND MY BOYS SEE FIT YOU

Ben and John watch shaking with rage Rit starts to cry
unleashing decades of emotion

RIT
You a devil You a devil Edward
Brodess You sold my daughters south
where nobody know dey name My babies

She sobs Brodess looks from Rit to Minty

BRODESS
I may have to sell this one too Rit
Can’t have this kind of mischief round
here But don’t worry about Minty she’s
strong Strong enough to pick cotton
Now git off my damn porch

John puts an arm around Minty and steers her away Ben
follows Brodess shouts after them

BRODESS (CONT’D)
John you and Ben ain’t welcome here no
more I don’t want you near my slaves
lest you spread your contagion STAY OFF
MY PROPERTY

( )
Brodess falls back in his chair mottled and gasping He
glares at his son

BRODESS (CONT’D)
Weren’t for you I’da sold that girl
years ago

Gideon goes after them

EXT BRODESS FARM - MOMENTS LATER

Ben supports a sobbing Rit John tries to comfort Minty He
takes her face and kisses her hard

Gideon pursues them

GIDEON
John you heard my daddy You and Ben
get on back to Thompsons

The men wrench themselves away from their wives and head off
toward the gate

Minty glares at Gideon She runs off into the woods

EXT WOODS - DAY

Minty collapses in front of an enormous poplar tree by a
creek crying praying fervently

MINTY
My massa an evil man Lord You know he
evil Dear Lord if you cain’t change
his soul take him TAKE HIM LORD

A chill runs up her spine and she turns
Gideon is standing not far away watching her

GIDEON
Lord don’t listen to niggers Minty I
been tellin’ you that since we was kids

Minty faces Gideon A cool breeze raises goose bumps on her
arms

GIDEON (CONT’D)
Since that time I had Typhoid as a boy
and mama had you sit with me First thing
I saw when I opened my eyes was your
little black face hair sticking up every
which way Praying

(MORE )

( )
GIDEON (CONT’D)
Scared the fever right outta me I got
used to your face but that praying
always made my skin crawl

He gives a rueful laugh full of complicated emotions

GIDEON (CONTD)
What the hell were you thinking hiring a
lawyer Did you think daddy would just
let you and your family free - damn near
half his property - just like that

She is turned half-towards him her face impassive He
studies her

GIDEON (CONTD)
Daddy warned me “Boy having a favorite
slave is like having a favorite pig You
can feed it play with it give it a
name but one day you might have to eat
it or sell it You know it and the pig
knows it If you have to sell it
there’s no more guilt than separating
piglets And if you have to eat it
youll forget its name”

He looks at her full of complicated emotions
GIDEON (CONTD)
I hope one day I forget yours C’mon
home Minty
He turns and walks back towards the farm Minty’s chest
rises and falls her feet refusing to follow Gideon turns
back

GIDEON (CONT’D)
Cmon I said

Minty stumbles after him

INT ROSS SLAVE CABIN - LATE NIGHT

Minty is sleeping Her eyes open A second later we hear
ELIZA’s SCREAM--

As Eliza continues screaming the other family members stir
EXT SLAVE CABINS - LATE NIGHT
Slaves come out of their cabins and look in the direction of

the big house Eliza’s distress coming from within

( )

ELIZA (0S)
He’s dead Oh God he’s dead

ON MINTY horrified

EXT BRODESS FARM - GRAVEYARD - DAY
A few gravestones on a shady patch of lawn

Minty Rit and Rachel stand with the women children and
elderly Brodess slaves at a fresh gravesite on the property
as the Ross brothers and male slaves lower Brodess’s plain
coffin into the earth A WHITE MINISTER mumbles gloomy words
to the neighboring farmers and family friends in attendance

Eliza is with her children face swollen from crying choked
with grief Rit and Rachel keep their eyes downcast
thoughts hidden Minty prays in earnest tears streaming
She looks up

Gideon is glaring at her wounded accusation in his eyes

EXT BRODESS FARM - WOODPILE - AFTERNOON

Minty is chopping lumber splitting upright logs on a stump
muscles rippling with each blow As she chops INTERCUT--
EXT WOODS - SAME

GIDEON hammers an AUCTION NOTICE onto trees He stands back
and reads it sweat and grief in his eyes NEGRO FOR SALE -
On Monday the 30th of September a female slave called
Minty about 25 years old

EXT BRODESS FARM - WOODPILE

ON MINTY - releasing her emotions on the wood She upends a
new log ax raised against the sky

The sound of insects grows louder A BIRD in a tree above
her chirps urgently

Minty faints embedding the ax in the wood unconscious on
her feet

MINTYS VISION -

(A) DARK CLOUDS race across the sky (B) A FLOCK OF BIRDS
take flight (C) HORSES break from their restraints and run
panicked flanks straining The VOICE otherworldly
present LEAVE NOW

EXT BRODESS FARM - MOMENTS LATER

Minty heaves the ax from the wood with a gasp She looks
around her panicked

In the distance the overseer Foxx approaches shading his
eyes against the blinding sun Minty drops the ax and edges
behind the shed She runs skirting the outbuildings She
can see Foxx searching for her

Minty evades him tearing up a path colliding with--

JOHN He holds her pulling her out of view She clings to
him

MINTY
John Johnny I gotta go I gotta go
right now

JOHN
I know We goin’

She looks up at him confused He pulls a crumpled auction
notice from his pocket - Negro For Sale

JOHN (CONTD)

She touches his face and lips shaking her head

MINTY

JOHN

Minty seems to consider this She kisses him hard
MINTY

Wait for me by de gate I’m gon’ say
goodbye to my mama

( )

John nods He presses her close
JOHN
We be alright Hear me Jes hurry

He kisses her again and dashes off Minty watches him

EXT BRODESS FARM - LATE AFTERNOON
From behind a barn Minty peeks out as

The slaves finish their work Rit rubs her back sighing at
the rising moon The air flickers with dragonflies and
moths Minty begins singing emotionally

MINTY
Im sorry Im going to leave you
Farewell oh farewell
But Ill meet you in the morning

MINTY’S VOICE floats to the slaves in the fields Rit is
unnerved by her daughter’s choice of song she looks around
for her as the other slaves join in

MINTY and SLAVES
Farewell oh farewell
Ill meet you in the morning Im bound
for the promised land
On the other side of Jordan Bound for
the promised land

Foxx reassured by the sound of her voice searches for the
source of it but by now all the slaves have taken up the
song obscuring her

Minty ducks towards the cabins

INT ROSS CABIN - CONTINUOUS

SINGING continues as Minty throws a few items into a cloth
and ties it to her waist tucking a knife into the makeshift
belt A pair of worn shoes are side by side near her
mother’s pallet Minty takes the shoes and puts them on her
bare feet With the knife she draws a heart in the dirt
floor where the shoes were

EXT BRODESS FARM - EDGE OF PROPERTY
SINGING continues as Minty sprints to the edge of the path

where she sees

( )

JOHN half-hidden in the trees near the gate waiting for her
anxiously

Eyes shining with tears Minty wrenches her eyes away from
him and takes off in the opposite direction

EXT WOODS - DUSK

Minty runs lightly through the woods as the moon rises

EXT BRODESS FARM - EDGE OF PROPERTY - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

John comes out of his hiding place and scans the growing
darkness for Minty chest tight with worry He heads back
towards the gate We hear HORSE HOOVES approaching

John is trapped with no place to hide as Gideon rides up

GIDEON
What you doing here John We don’t want
your kind here

John raises his hands submissively

JOHN
Come to kiss my wife is all suh Sho
is hard not bein’ able to see her

GIDEON
You better get used to missing her John
In fact if I was you I’d find another
wife Now git yourself back to
Thompson’s Mill

JOHN

John turns and starts away holding his breath He walks a
few paces

We hear the thunder of hoofbeats as Foxx rides up on
horseback

FOXX
Gideon

GIDEON
What is it

FOXX

( )

Gideon raises his gun aiming at John’s back

GIDEON
Stop right there nigger

John turns around Gideon and Foxx corner him

GIDEON (CONTD)
Where is she Where’s Minty

JOHN
I tol’ you I was just comin’ to see her--

Gideon takes his riding crop and STRIKES him across the face
John falls to the ground blood in his eyes

EXT THOMPSON’S MILL - POPLAR NECK - NIGHT

A mill by a man-made waterfall surrounded by stacks of
lumber

Minty skirts around it towards a scattering of small cabins

INT THOMPSON’S MILL - BEN’S CABIN - NIGHT

The modest cabin is decorated with wood carvings and hand-
crafted figurines Ben takes off his boots painfully He
rubs his knees

There’s a knock Minty’s face at the window Ben glances up
then immediately turns away He opens the door avoiding her
face

BEN
Don’t wanna look at ya Wanna say I
ain’t seen ya I can see your heart

MINTY
Daddy dey gon’ sell me down river where

Ben turns away packing a small sack with biscuits and yams
BEN

Listen here gurl - you go to Rev Green

( )

MINTY
But Reverend Green always preachin’
obedience

Ben turns to her sharply still avoiding her face

BEN
Do what I say Go to Rev Green church

MINTY
Yes daddy

He hands her the sack then goes to a shelf where small
figures of his wife and children have been lovingly crafted
from wood He picks up the one of himself and presses it
into her hand Her hand covers his They stand there a
moment hands clasped together

BEN
Just know I’1l1 be with you

MINTY
I love you daddy

BEN
I love you too

A sob is stuck in his chest the strain of not looking at her
proving too much for him

BEN (CONT’D)
Go on then

Minty tucks the figure into her pocket and kisses him She
walks out the door
EXT BEN ROSS’S CABIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

BEN

Ben steps out points in the sky towards the Big Dipper
BEN (CONTD)
Don’t forgit the Big Dipper Pointer

( )

Minty turns and runs Ben stands silhouetted in the doorway
eyes dropping to the earth
EXT WOODS - POPLAR NECK - LATER

Minty runs using the stars to get her bearings

EXT REV GREEN’S CHURCH - NIGHT

Minty approaches a clearing in the woods Rock formations
marking the graves of slaves and freedmen cast shadows in
the moonlight A small wood building with a rough hewn cross
rises beyond the graves

The church is dark Minty tries the door It’s bolted shut
She bangs on it We hear noises from inside

REVEREND GREEN (0S)
Who is it

MINTY
Minty Ben Ross’s daughter

Rev Green opens the door and pulls her in quickly

INT REV GREEN’S CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

He bolts the door behind them It’s dark in the church and
Green is in a dressing gown

REVEREND GREEN
Girl what are you doing out here alone

MINTY
My daddy say ask you to pray for my
journey

There’s a shift in Rev Green’s demeanor He lights candles

REVEREND GREEN
You the one wit the spells

MINTY

He turns to her the candle illuminating his skepticism

REVEREND GREEN
And you intend to run

( )

MINTY

chance in a fox grove If the slavers

copperhead will Can you even read
child

Minty shakes her head He sits her on a bench and sits
beside her

REVEREND GREEN (CONT’D)
Maybe nobody noticed you gone Maybe
you can sneak back ‘fore daylight

Minty looks up at him suddenly fierce

MINTY
I ain’t goin’ back I wan’ be free

The power of the words stuns Minty - words never spoken The
reverend nods solemnly His manner businesslike

REVEREND GREEN
There’s not much time It’s near
midnight You must be miles away from
here by dawn I need you to remember
what I tell you Can you do that

Minty nods determined trying not to be overwhelmed

REVEREND GREEN (CONT’D)
Fear is your enemy Trust in God

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Minty runs through the woods She stumbles picks herself up
and runs again

REVEREND GREEN (OVER)
Keep the Choptank River to your left and
the North Star ahead If there are no
stars just keep following the river If
you can’t see the river - listen for it
You know moss grows where its dark and
wet - wet points to the water

( )

Above the trees we see the Big Dipper Beyond it the North
Star A river glitters in the moonlight

REVEREND GREEN (OVER) (CONT’D)
Follow the Choptank to its headwaters in
Delaware When the river splits cross
the rushing creek to your left and head
straight North

Minty squats peeing The moon’s reflection is caught in a
brackish pond The woods are alive with sound

REVEREND GREEN (OVER) (CONTD)
In a few day’s time the Delaware River
will be on your right Follow it to
Wilmington look for a blacksmith and
iron merchant named Thomas Garrett I’11
send him word

She finishes and takes off again running lightly over tree
roots and fallen limbs

REVEREND GREEN (OVER) (CONTD)
May God be with you

EXT THOMPSON’S MILL - NIGHT
ON BEN - mournful and sincere

BEN
I ain’t seen her suh Ain’t looked on
my daughter’s face since Massa Brodess
run us off

Gideon and Foxx face Ben and his boss the owner of the
estate AC THOMPSON 50s John stands bleeding between
them face split from the whip Gideon is irate

GIDEON
Is that so

AC THOMPSON
Ben’s an honest nigger Gideon He says
he ain’t seen her he ain’t

Gideon approaches John full of menace
GIDEON
This one knows something Caught him

sniffin’ round the cabins just when Minty
ran off

( )

JOHN
I tol’ you I ain’t seen her

Thompson steps between them

AC THOMPSON
Nephew this is uncalled for These men
are my respected workers I will not
have them further injured

The two white men face off Thompson richer and more
powerful Gideon a head taller and decades younger

GIDEON
If your niggers helped my slave escape
I’m holding you responsible So if you
don’t want me taking this personal
uncle why don’t you send some of your
men to help me bring her back

Gideon and Thompson glare at each other

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Minty lies asleep on a bed of pine needles hidden against a
ridge Suddenly she’s jarred awake by a tidal wave in her
soul

A PRAYING MANTIS seems to be looking at her intently We
hear THE VOICE QUIET DANGER

We hear DOGS and VOICES Minty doesn’t dare move

A PATROL of men on horseback approaching We hear GIDEONS
VOICE

GIDEON (0S)
Morris you and Butch stay to the roads
Foxx and me will take the woods

The men split off A SLAVE with hounds on a leash leads
Gideon and Foxx deeper into the woods away from her

Suddenly the dogs seem to catch a scent and go veering in her
direction--

ON MINTY - Frozen If she moves she risks being seen But
she can’t wait for the dogs

Minty takes off tearing through the woods pursued closely
by the dogs only 50 yards behind her

( )

Gideon and Foxx ride after the dogs the horses picking their
way through the overgrown woods with difficulty

FOXX
They got a scent

WE FOLLOW MINTY - as she plows through thickets of trees
branches slapping her face and arms She trips over the
carcass of a possum She picks it up and hurls it away from
her Sliding painfully into a ravine

She dives under a fallen tree disturbing a SNAKE which
unwinds itself from a branch above her head and dangles face
to face Minty tries to control her terror as the dogs pass
close going after the dead possum

HORSES’ LEGS follow jumping the ravine Minty keeps her
eyes on the snake as she edges out of her hiding place She
runs in the opposite direction

EXT WOODS’ EDGE - DAWN

Minty catches her breath at a tree line an enormous clearing
before her The North Star shines ahead faint in the
growing light We can hear the dogs barking behind her back
on her scent She steels her nerve and runs--

Dashing across the open space a dark small figure against
the graying landscape She races for the distant tree line
EXT TREE LINE - MINUTES LATER

Minty looks back The wide expanse is clear then we see
the tiny figures of the dogs followed by Gideon and Foxx
with lanterns converging with the men from Thompson’s Mill
They ride towards her then separate hoping to head her off
Minty peels the shoes from her bloody feet and rubs her skin
and shoes with spruce pine trying to cover her scent We
hear the dogs barking in the distance Minty runs

EXT CREEK BRIDGE - MORNING

Minty drags herself forward exhausted She comes to a

bridge over a fast moving creek Minty hesitates

( )

We hear HORSES AND DOGS She dashes across looking behind
her as--

BUTCH and MORRIS two dangerous looking white men converge
with the dogs on horseback Minty sprints away from them
but stops short when--

GIDEON appears with Foxx the other side also on horseback

GIDEON
Minty you devilish girl

Minty eyes the churning water below the Thompson’s Mill men
advancing slowly from the other side Gideon gestures for
them to halt He dismounts inching towards her

GIDEON (CONTD)

C’mon back peaceful Your family’s
worried about you Your mama’s crying
your sister too C’mon home

Minty’s eyes flick to the water and back to Gideon He
stops a few paces away

GIDEON (CONTD)

You thinking bout jumping Suicide’s a
sin against God - you know that Against
those that own you too

Minty climbs onto the rail Gideon inches closer He leans
on the rail several feet away speaking casually

GIDEON (CONTD)

I’ve decided not to sell you after all
Minty You been there all my life - Id
miss your ugly face I’m gonna have to
hurt you a little to teach you a lesson
But it wont be too bad long as you come
back gentle C’mon home Minty

Minty looks him dead in the eyes

MINTY
I’ma be free or die

In the blink of an eye she thrusts herself off the rail
into the churning water below

The patrol converges on the bridge Gideon watches in horror
as the current pulls her away and under

GIDEON
Goddamnit Minty

EXT RIVER BANK —- DAY

Gideon Foxx and the dogs search the river’s edge Down
river Morris shakes his head and draws a hand across his
neck She must be dead

EXT RIVER BANK - DOWNSTREAM - AFTERNOON

Minty wakes sprawled at the edge of the river bank She
pushes onto her hands and knees vomiting water After a
moment she crawls to her feet Her shoes are gone along
with her head wrap the knife everything but her tattered
dress which hangs indecently from her battered body

She searches frantically in her pocket for the figurine of
her father giving a sob of relief when she finds it
Barefoot hair wild she trudges off

EXT FARMLAND - MARYLAND-DELAWARE BORDER - LATE AFTERNOON
Minty runs through wide open farmland exposed in the
afternoon light searching desperately for a place to hide

She sees

A FARM HOUSE in the distance Another across the road field-
hands with the cattle slaves working the fields

Minty sees a farm cart covered with a tarp She sprints
towards it
EXT FARM CART - SAME

The cart is piled high with wheat and hay Minty crawls
beneath the tarp and tucks herself between bales of hay

She rests Her breathing slows her eyes closing

EXT FARM CART - PRE-DAWN

ON MINTY - She opens her eyes The cart is moving Minty
peeks from underneath the tarp

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - CONTINUOUS

MINTY’S POV - The farm cart bumps along a country road
passing

( )

SLAVE CATCHERS heading the opposite direction THREE
RUNAWAY SLAVES tied together in the back passing close
enough to see their despair

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - JUST BEFORE SUNRISE
The cart stops Minty peeks from underneath the tarp

The farmer dismounts He looks up at the stars He speaks
softly almost to himself

FARMER
I know you’re there I’m heading to
market just up the road Best get out
now

Minty jumps from the wagon and darts into the trees She
watches as the farmer climbs on his horse and drives off

The sky breathes with dawn’s first light Minty finds the
North Star and runs

EXT DELAWARE - RIVERFRONT - DAY

The sky is just clearing after a downpour Minty is soaked
and shivering hiding at the corner of a tavern near a
sparsely populated stretch of waterfront

MINTY’S POV - A WHITE COUPLE kiss in front of the tavern 20
feet away Minty looks past them to

A BLACK BOAT WORKER docking his skiff

As the couple moves off Minty makes a dash for the river
approaching the black boatman

MINTY
Suh You know a blacksmith round here
name of Garrett

The boatman JASPER MARLEY looks down at the tiny figure in
the drenched torn dress He quickly whips off his rough
cloak and throws it around her shoulders

JASPER
Careful girl You half dressed look
half dead Anyone with eyes can see what
you are The man you looking for is on
the corner of 4th and Shipley No more
than half a mile west

( )

Minty pulls the cloak around her It drags the ground She
looks up into the sailor’s rough worried face

MINTY
Thank you suh

She staggers off Jasper watches with concern

INT EXT GARRETT HOUSE AND SHOP - SHIPLEY STREET

THOMAS GARRETT a youthful and robust white man in his
fifties dressed plainly in the manner of the Quakers
polishes a set of fire irons an assortment of ironworks on
display around him

He hears a rustling and looks up jumping as he sees Minty
shrouded in the dripping cloak like death itself

GARRETT
May I help thee friend

MINTY

GARRETT

Yes I do I’ve been waiting for thee

Minty collapses

INT GARRETT HOUSE - BEDROOM - EVENING

Minty wakes in a strange bed in a plain room She’s in her
underclothes She sits up alarmed

Across the foot of the bed is a plain chocolate brown dress

On a table next to her bed sits her father’s CARVED FIGURINE

INT GARRETT HOUSE - CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER

MINTY’S BARE BANDAGED FEET pad down a corridor The dress is
too short and comes high above her ankles She hears voices
below and tentatively starts downstairs

INT GARRETT HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Thomas Garrett sits at the head of a long table laden with

food His wife RACHEL GARRETT looks up as she sees Minty
She’s very plain with a kind smile

( )

RACHEL GARRETT
I couldn’t mend your dress I’m afraid
T’was too far gone What you’re wearing
was our Amy’s favorite She’s with the
Lord and has no use for it But she
would approve I found something in the
pocket of your dress which I put by your
bed It looked important

MINTY
Thank you

Minty looks at them timidly They’re both emotional

THOMAS GARRETT
Well Come down You must be hungry

INT GARRETT HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - LATER

Minty sits at the table with Rachel and Garrett Garrett is
holding forth while Rachel watches him indulgently

THOMAS GARRETT
You’re not the first to sit at our table
confused and hungry - far from it
Helping fugitive slaves is my divine duty
and my life’s work Why I almost lost
this house just last year when I was
sued in federal court for aiding slaves
After being tried convicted and heavily
fined the judge asked me if I’d learned
my lesson I said to the court “If thee
knows of any slave who needs assistance
send him to me for I now pledge to
double my diligence in assisting slaves
to freedom”

He laughs robustly Rachel smiles and pats his hand He
takes a bite of pork peering at Minty bright-eyed

THOMAS GARRETT (CONT’D)
So tell me friend how did thee find the
courage to come all this way alone

MINTY
T’was de Lord I think God wan’ me be
free

THOMAS GARRETT
My dear child I believe that God means
all mankind to be free

Minty looks at him in wonder

MINTY
Suh you a saint

THOMAS GARRETT
No friend I’m a Quaker

EXT PENNSYLVANIA BORDER - SUNRISE

A horse-drawn carriage drives across a broad plain as sunrise
tinges the horizon pink and gold

Garrett drives the horses wearing the broad-brimmed hat and
cloak that distinguishes the Quakers He brings the carriage
to a stop climbs down and opens the back

Minty gets out half hidden by a wide Quaker hat

THOMAS GARRETT
Here we are friend The Pennsylvania
border Shall I drive thee across or
would thee prefer to walk into freedom
alone on thy own feet

MINTY
(overwhelmed)
I’1l walk with de Lord

Minty gives him back the hat and cloak She still wears his
daughter’s plain brown dress He regards her fondly

THOMAS GARRETT
Then this is where I’1ll leave thee It’s
25 miles to Philadelphia Find the
Pennsylvania Antislavery Society and ask
for William Still

He reaches in his cloak and presses a daguerreotype of a
handsome black man into her hands

Minty looks at it in wonder

THOMAS GARRETT (CONT’D)
This is his likeness so you’ll know him
when you see him Until we see each
other again God bless thee

MINTY
God bless you suh

A small sign marks the Delaware-Pennsylvania border As
Minty walks past it the sun rises bathing the countryside
in light Minty looks down at her hands to see if she’s
changed She spins around in the field exuberant

EXT PHILADELPHIA - STREET - DAY

The bustling city of Philadelphia A carriage passes
revealing Minty She looks around her in wonder

He looks her over realizing

WILLIAM STILL

( )

MINTY
(she hesitates)
A white man name of Garrett sent me

A beat William looks at her with clinical interest

WILLIAM STILL
Please have a seat

William leads her to a chair by a desk He disappears into a
back room and returns a few moments later with a cup of water
and a weathered copper case from which he removes a marbled
NOTEBOOK He puts the cup in front of Minty and opens the
book dipping a pen in ink

Minty drinks the water gratefully

WILLIAM STILL (CONT’D)
What is your full name and where are you
from

WILLIAM STILL
Youre a brave and lucky girl Minty

Would you like to choose a new name to
mark your freedom Many ex-slaves do
Whatever name you want

confidence Harriet still resisting the urge to duck looks
at the whites around her mystified

HARRIET
How you tell de angels from de devils

A folding screen separates the tub from the kitchen offering
a bit of privacy

Harriet takes off the dress and underclothes and lets them
fall to the floor She catches her reflection in a piece of
mirror A map of scars both old and new covers her lean
muscular body

Marie catches a glimpse of Harriet’s body as she lowers
herself into the bath

the slaves can see but the marshals can’t The slaves
watch on edge

forehead
With her free hand she tips her hat back to show her scar

try to make another payment next month

measured in negroes We can’t live like

sell the farm

Eliza turns away from him sullen

GIDEON (CONTD)

We’ll sell the Ross brothers Robert
alone is worth 6-7 hundred If we sell
Junyah and Henry too we can bring home
maybe 16 That will go aways to paying
off daddy’s debts You won’t have to
beg the twins can remain useless and we
can go on as we have

With you unmarried and sleeping in
brothels

Gideon and Eliza exchange a loaded look
GIDEON

Then John walks into view taking Caroline in his arms He
holds her tight letting her comfort him Caroline kisses

This truth sobers them Just then we see a dark form
streaking across the field towards them Harriet runs to
meet him

HARRIET
Robert Thank God

ROBERT
Minty

He lifts her off her feet embracing her The others
surround him

HARRIET
How’s Mary Tell us

Robert is breathing hard from exertion and emotion making
words difficult

ROBERT
We got ourselves a baby girl Delivered
myself not an hour ago Set her on her
mama’s breast and kissed ‘em goodbye

Phoebe’s baby gives a faint cry Robert is overcome with
emotion

ROBERT (CONTD)
Mary’s too weak from childbirth to run
even if I could convince her I had to
leave ‘em

( )

Ben reaches for his son’s shoulder
Harriet looks up into her brother’s face sharing his pain

HARRIET
You had to leave ‘em either free or in
chains You chose freedom

She hands him the satchel Robert pulls the suit from the
satchel and looks at her

ROBERT
You come for John I’m sorry Minty

Harriet shakes her head

HARRIET
I thought I come for him I see now I
come for all of you

Robert pulls off his shirt revealing a profusion of scars on
his muscled back like a network of rivers

BEN
Aint but a few hours a dark left If

The siblings take a last look at their mother in Ben’s cabin
wishing they could say goodbye

EXT THOMPSON’S MILL - MINUTES LATER

goin’ nowhere til all my children free

He touches his daughter’s face

Harriet leads the freedom seekers off leaving Ben alone on
the path He waits until he no longer hears them then he
lifts the kerchief from his damp eyes

Gideon circles Walter menacingly

( )
GIDEON

Walter pulls a beat up notice from his pocket
WALTER
This here your notice right Runaway

He pulls out a sketch pad and hands it to Gideon

There’s a SKETCH of the slaves convening in the woods
another of Harriet - no longer the same slave girl Gideon

once knew but clearly recognizable as Minty
Gideon looks up from the drawing eyes burning

GIDEON
Where’d you see her

Bigger the nigger’s worth the wait

Just then Walter rides up on his horse followed by

BIGGER LONG a large dark scar-faced man with hostile eyes
and an unpleasant disposition A THICK BLACK MUTT trots
beside him

Bigger looks at the group without speaking

chuckle dangerously

revealing the trap door He gives the reverend a nasty
smile

What have we here reverend

REVEREND GREEN

For a second their eyes meet

HARRIET
God have other plans for me Mr Still

They come to what appears to be an abandoned warehouse door
guarded by a man wearing a pistol

Harriet looks at William eyes questioning Still nods to
the guard

Good evening Martin

Evening Mr Still

The guard opens the door William leads Harriet into the
darkened warehouse past dusty kegs of wine

INT WINE CELLARMEETING ROOMS - CONTINUOUS

William leads Harriet down a narrow stair and into a series
of rooms well lit with many candles fixtures on the walls
and tables

Inside is a bigger interracial crowd than Harriet’s ever
seen It’s mostly black men but there are whites as well
some women too conversing and socializing as if it were
normal

Several anterooms lead off from the main room stacked floor
to ceiling with wine bottles On one long wall hangs a huge
map of the United States showing free and slave states and
the territory open to slavery or freedom by the repeal of the
Missouri Compromise

HARRIET
Who are these people

WILLIAM STILL
This is the Committee The organizers
and officers of the Underground Railroad
dedicated to helping slaves escape
bondage No one sees this Only the
initiated

Near the map is a blackboard which reads “CONDUCTOR --
PASSENGERS -- LOST”

Underneath are the names of the conductors written in chalk
and the numbers All the conductors have lost some
passengers Still writes her name on the board and puts down
“9 and “0” lost William quiets the crowd

WILLIAM STILL (CONT’D)
Ladies and gentlemen may I present a
most extraordinary woman Mrs Harriet
Tubman Harriet escaped from slavery
herself just a year ago and she’s
already gone back to liberate others
She’s brought back nine souls and lost
none In recognition of her bravery and
skill I welcome her to the committee as
a “conductor” on the railroad

( )

Some applause and murmurs of approval from the Committee
The men size her up It’s a tough room Harriet tries to
process this

WILLIAM STILL (CONT’D)
(low to Harriet)
They don’t necessarily like new members
You’1l have to win them over They’1l
learn to trust you after a few missions

She eyes the men warily

HARRIET
Question is will I trust dem What’s a
conductor

WILLIAM STILL
A conductor accompanies passengers or
“cargo” to safe houses or “stations” run
by “stationmasters” like my friend
Sydney Howard Gay one of the main agents
of the UGRR Sydney meet Harriet

SYDNEY HOWARD GAY a white man in his 50s shakes her hand

SYDNEY HOWARD GAY
Good to have you aboard

An intense looking black man in his thirties with a wild mane
of hair approaches

WILLIAM STILL
Harriet this is Fred Douglass also from
the Eastern Shore of Maryland

FREDERICK DOUGLASS
Welcome Harriet and congratulations

HARRIET
Thank you suh

FREDERICK DOUGLASS
Call me Fred After all we’re both
fugitives from the eastern shore
William brings her toward two bonneted Quaker women
WILLIAM STILL
May I present Mrs Lucretia Mott and her
sister Martha Coffin Wright

HARRIET
Hello

( )

Martha gives her a conspiratorial smile

MARTHA COFFIN WRIGHT

It’s a pleasure to welcome a woman to the
committee

WILLIAM STILL
And I believe you’ve met Thomas Garrett
chief station agent in Delaware He will
be your main contact

Garrett grabs her hand warmly

THOMAS GARRETT
Friend it’s good to see thee and to
know well be working together

HARRIET
Good to see you Thomas

Still escorts her to a group of black men

WILLIAM STILL
And these men are our chief conductors
Lewis Napoleon who works closely with
Sydney Gay Moses Pinkett of Wilmington
and George Wilmer who is technically
still enslaved in Kent County

The men nod coolly Harriet is fixated on George Wilmer

HARRIET
You still a slave when you could be
free

GEORGE WILMER
I find it easier to help the cause from
the plantation Massa trusts me lets me
come an go as I please Calls mea
“noble nigger”

He gives her a wicked smile

WILLIAM STILL
George Wilmer is an “abductor”

HARRIET
Abductor

WILLIAM STILL
Someone who steals slaves directly from
the plantation under the overseer’s
nose They have the most dangerous
jobs

( )
A big powerful black man approaches full of self-
importance

WILLIAM STILL (CONT’D)

Clay towers over Harriet extending his hand

JOHN CLAY
John Clay 9 - not bad for your first
time I abducted 18 on my first run
Only lost two

HARRIET
Who were de two

JOHN CLAY
Pardon me

HARRIET
Two you lost who were dey

JOHN CLAY

I do I’ll remember they name

Clay offended stalks off William looks at her with

respect

go over a map of the South and the slave states showing

slave density by county

WILLIAM STILL
4 million enslaved black southerners who
need to be liberated but all we can do
at the moment is help a few at a time
while fighting the bigger battle to end
slavery

( )

HARRIET
I need to get back to Bucktown to get my
sister We left her lone

WILLIAM STILL
There are sympathetic captains and black
jacks who will take you down the
Chesapeake into Maryland but it’s far
too dangerous for you to go back to
Bucktown We’ll make every attempt to
rescue your sister but you must think
beyond your family You’re a conductor
now with duties and responsibilities to
the Underground Railroad

FREDERICK DOUGLASS
Which is in danger of becoming the
upperground railroad if some of our well-
meaning and noble friends continue
brazenly touting their accomplishments

Garrett takes offense

THOMAS GARRETT
I’1l make no secret of my mission to aid
runaways Why should I It’s God’s work
were doing

FREDERICK DOUGLASS
While I applaud your noble daring and
willingness to subject yourself to bodily
harm by openly avowing your participation
in the escape of slaves I can see very
little good resulting from it either for
you or for the escaping slaves

As the group devolves into friendly bickering Harriet turns
back to the map trying to make sense of it She whispers to
Martha

HARRIET
Show me Maryland

She points to it on the map

MARTHA COFFIN WRIGHT
It’s this strip right here

She points to Philadelphia

MARTHA COFFIN WRIGHT (CONT’D)
And here we are in Philadelphia

Harriet traces the short distance with her finger marveling

( )

HARRIET
It look so close
Behind her the bickering continues
THOMAS GARRETT
How can we influence hearts and minds if
were too timid to say what we’re doing
FREDERICK DOUGLASS
There’s a difference between timid and
discreet Thomas

EXT BALTIMORE MEETING HALL - AFTERNOON

A large crowd of slaveholders and lawmen are gathered on the
steep steps Tempers run high as the planters demand action
A mutton-chopped slave owner GUS VERN is speaking

GUS VERN
What’s going to be done about Moses
This fiend is threatening our very
existence

SLAVE OWNER
They say he’s black as the night

GUS VERN
If he was a black we would’a caught ‘im
He’s one of those white abolitionists in
blackface

Reveal Gideon amongst the crowd

( )

SLAVE OWNER

My family has personally lost thousands
of dollars worth of labor Moses must be
stopped now

INT BALTIMORE MEETING HALL - DAY

Men in dark pants and expensive shoes marching towards the
door

EXT BALTIMORE MEETING HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

A group of POLITICIANS in black coats and hats exit the
doors and stand at the pillared entry Everyone quiets in
anticipation as

A LOCAL STATESMAN comes to the top of the stairs waving a
telegraph in one hand

LOCAL STATESMAN
I have the results of the vote in
congress that you’ve been waiting for
The Fugitive Slave Act has just been
voted into law From now on nowhere in
these United States will a slave find
safe harbor You are free to pursue your
property with the aid and protection of
the law wherever they may be

Ecstatic CHEERING drowns out the Local Statesman
Slaveholders throw hats in the air and smack each others’
backs Now we see Gideon standing amongst them As the
crowd begins to disperse

Gideon sees Bigger Long standing in an alley Bigger jerks
his chin to Gideon Gideon pushes through the crowd and
approaches

EXT ALLEY NEAR BALTIMORE MEETING HALL - AFTERNOON
Gideon joins Bigger

GIDEON
Do you have news

BIGGER LONG
A slave out at Vern’s farm heard a rumor
that the gal that led your slaves off -
one you lookin’ so hard for - is the
slave they call Moses

( )

GIDEON
(he laughs)

Moses ain’t a nigger and he certainly
ain’t no woman He’s an abolitionist in
blackface

BIGGER LONG
Or maybe she’s a little black thing bout
so high named Harriet Tubman

GIDEON
I don’t know no nigger named Harriet
Tubman

BIGGER LONG
What about Araminta Ross

Gideon goes still He stunned

GIDEON
Impossible There’s no conceivable

He falls into thought Bigger watches him process

BIGGER LONG
My price just went up

GIDEON
Only if you find her

BIGGER LONG
Hear she’s hiding out in Philadelphia

EXT BRODESS HOUSE - EVENING

We can see Rachel and Eliza moving about inside

Harriet hides in the bushes and watches as Rachel comes
downstairs with a tray She looks beaten and frail

Harriet takes in her sister’s fragile appearance with pain
She throws a pebble at the kitchen window

( )

Rachel looks out Harriet steps from the shadows Rachel’s
eyes go wide She backs away

A few moments later Rachel quietly opens the front door and
slips out

Harriet pulls her to the side of the house They speak in
whispers Rachel is terrified

scorn

Rachel turns and slips back into the house

Harriet stands there a moment devastated then she ducks
into the shadows

Gradually she becomes aware that someone is watching her

HARRIET
So why should I trust you

WALTER
I just saved your life not for the first
time I’d like to go on saving it

HARRIET

WILLIAM STILL
Fugitives beware There are slave
hunters in our midst Congress has
passed the Fugitive Slave Act allowing
slave-hunters to pursue slaves in any
state in the Union and obliging law
enforcement to turn over fugitives
Prepare to fight or flee north to Canada

William spots her and jumps from the platform fighting his
way to her

As Harriet lies on the floor a scene of tragedy playing
itself out before her eyes we hear REVEREND GREEN’S VOICE

Slave catchers are monitoring all the
northbound travel God help the man
without free papers I’ve read of
freedmen being pulled from trains as far
north as New Bedford and Boston

WILLIAM STILL
How are we going to get our passengers
from the southern farms and plantations
all the way to the Canadian border

The room falls into depressed silence

FREDERICK DOUGLASS
We can’t keep trying to outrun them
John Brown is right We have to fight
The only way to make the Fugitive Slave
Law a dead letter is to make half a dozen
or more dead slave catchers That will
cool their ardor

WILLIAM STILL
Perhaps civil war is our only hope

Harriet looks at them incredulous

( )

HARRIET
We cain’t just give up and wait for war
We gotta get back to work bringing
slaves to freedom By train carriage
horseback - by foot if necessary

WILLIAM STILL
Harriet it’s 600 miles from Maryland to
the Canadian border Your longest trip
so far has been 100 miles It would take
months not weeks You can’t--

HARRIET
I ain’t givin’ up rescuing slaves because
it’s far

She walks around the room looking people in the eye

HARRIET (CONT’D)

Many a you don’t know slavery first hand
You were born free or maybe you been
free so long you forget what it’s like

She looks at Douglass

HARRIET (CONT’D)
You got comfortable and important

She looks at William

HARRIET (CONTD)

A pitifully thin slave girl Rachel’s daughter ANGER 8
brings in a tray balancing the pot and cup carefully She
goes to tip some drops of laudanum into the tea

ELIZA
No more I don’t want it

GIDEON
It’s for your nerves mother

I don’t want it

She knocks the tray from Anger’s hands spilling the scalding

bends to pick up the broken china

blames me for her mother They’re all

A large group of planters are gathered in the woods
including Vern The mood is dangerous

Eliza and Gideon are in the center of the circle

GUS VERN
Seeing as how Moses has been discovered
to be a nigger girl from your farm we
think it’s only appropriate that you pay
us restitutions for our lost property

GIDEON
We don’t have that kind of money We’re
going through hard times like the rest
of you

Then you gon’ have to sell the farm

ELIZA

If we work together we can catch her I
have a plan

make her pay for what she done to your
fortune and family Rest assured she
will be tried and executed by the

mysteriously as the wagon bounces along

Tilly steels her courage and drives the horses towards the
bridge doing her best to channel her master as the wagon
approaches the roadblock of lawmen

TILLY

Gentlemen good day What’s all this

A LAWMAN steps forward

LAWMAN

Yes sir He’s my daddy

The sheriff laughs He puts a foot up on the side of the
wagon

SHERIFF NED UTLEY

EXT ROCKY TERRAIN

ON HARRIET - Crouched against the rocks gun aimed--FIRING
Bigger’s hat flies off his head Damn close but not close
enough As Harriet frantically reloads her revolver Bigger

aims at her with murderous rage

BIGGER LONG

GUNFIRE--

Bigger falls forward and slides off his horse shot in the
head

ON GIDEON - emerging from the woods behind him rifle
smoking

EXT WOODY PLATEAU - LATE AFTERNOON

Gideon emerges onto a wooded plateau starkly beautiful in
the late afternoon light

Bigger’s horse is grazing some distance away riderless
Gideon looks around No sign of Harriet

GIDEON
MINTY

Suddenly she appears behind him Colt revolver pointed at his
head

HARRIET
Toss your gun Easy

Gideon slowly removes his rifle and tosses it to the ground
at her feet -- quickly drawing a revolver from his holster--

Harriet SHOOTS the gun from his hand Gideon howls in pain
a fleshy hole by his thumb

HARRIET (CONT’D)
Off the horse

Gideon slides from his horse cradling his bloody hand He
faces her breathing hard The two of them only yards apart
the closest they’ve been since the day she jumped from the
bridge She tucks her revolver at her waist picks up his
rifle and trains it on him

HARRIET (CONT’D)
On your knees

He sinks to his knees looking up at her teeth clenched in
pain

( )

GIDEON
It didn’t have to end like this Minty
You could’a stayed with us if you only
knew how to behave But you were so
damned insolent Unruly and untamed I
guess that’s what I liked about you And
you liked me too I know you did You
prayed over my bed when I was sick You
asked God to make me well

She looks at him with something like empathy

HARRIET
I asked God how a sickly little boy could
think he owned me

Gideon’s eyes turn hard

GIDEON
I do own you Minty Even now you’re
mine You’re just a damn runaway

HARRIET
I was never yours Gideon I was never
nobodys property That was a lie you
told yourselves Since the day your
daddy sold my sisters I prayed for God to
make me strong enough to fight and
thats what Ive prayed for ever since
I reasoned there was one of two things I
had a right to liberty or death If I
couldnt have one Id have the other

GIDEON
You know what they’1l do to you when
they finally catch you They’1l tear you
limb from limb tar you and burn you
alive Even if I’m not there to watch
it I can almost smell it now Like
roasting pig

Harriet remains unfazed She levels the rifle at his face

HARRIET
But you’ll die right here

Gideon flinches waiting for the gunshot

But Harriet lowers the rifle using it to gesture to the
woods around them

( )

HARRIET (CONTD)
On a frozen blood-soaked battlefield
the moans of a generation of young men in
your ears dying in agony around you for
a lost cause For a vile and wicked
idea For the sin of slavery Can you
hear them

For a moment we hear the death-moans of a thousand men in
the aftermath of bloody defeat

Gideon looks spooked as if he can see their mangled bodies
stretching into the distance He looks back at Harriet

HARRIET (CONTD)
God dont mean people to own people
Gideon Our time is near

Harriet tosses the rifle then turns and walks away towards
the grazing horse Gideon watches her tears welling in his
eyes

GIDEON
You bitch You destroyed my family

Harriet swings herself onto the horse’s back She speaks in
THE VOICE - it’s her own maybe it always has been

HARRIET
You tried to destroy my family but you
can’t You tried to destroy my people
but you won’t God has shown me the
future and my people are free MY
PEOPLE ARE FREE

Gideon watches as Harriet rides off into the glare of the
setting sun

ON HARRIET face grim eyes turned inward
We hear HER VOICE from the opening

For a moment nothing changes Then we see
FEET RUNNING as

SLAVES begin pouring from the woods running for the beach
towards the armed black troops in the rowboats

HUNDREDS OF SLAVES carrying their children and meager
belongings on their backs splashing through churning water
towards the boats and FREEDOM

Their voices join hers singing triumphantly

CODA

Harriet Tubman was the most famous conductor on the
Underground Railroad helping over 70 slaves to freedom

After the UGRR disbanded at the start of the Civil War
Harriet became a spy for the Union army On June 2 1863
Harriet Tubman led 150 black Union soldiers in the Combahee
River Raid freeing over 750 slaves from the rice
Plantations She is the only woman to lead an armed
expedition during the entire Civil War and one of the few
women to have done so in US history

After the Civil War Tubman remarried and dedicated her life
to helping impoverished former slaves the elderly and the
womens suffrage movement She died surrounded by loved ones
on March 10 1913 at approximately 91 years of age Her last
words were “I go to prepare a place for you”
