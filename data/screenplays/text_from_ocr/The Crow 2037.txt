DEEP SHADOW

Parts of the screen slowly lighten to REVEAL what appears to
be the silhouette of Christ on the cross The shadow of a
bird flutters into frame landing on its shoulder

BASIL (VO)
Let he remain for he with righteous eye
look upon death and yet not die and
through the streets the black angels go
in heaven we shall meet so says the
crow

The figure comes into focus to REVEAL its a SCARECROW with a
large black crow on its shoulder Slowly PULL BACK to REVEAL
its perched atop a rundown two-story tenement building

Subtitle reads October 31 2010 - Halloween as we TILT
DOWN the face of the building which is at the end of a--

DEAD-END STREET

The sound of a RUMBLING engine and BOOMING opera precedes the
arrival of an ominous black hot-rodded hearse

The drivers side door opens Out steps MAX a small
hunchback in a black chauffeurs uniform He steps around to
the passengers side rear door and opens it

A very tall 50-ish man with black hair steps out His
razor-sharp features accented by long jagged sideburns and a
pointed goatee resemble nothing short of Satan himself But
in direct contrast to his evil face are his clothes -- a
priests suit and collar This is FATHER DAMIEN FINCH

DAMIEN
Max the bag

MAX
Got it right here boss

DAMIEN
Follow me

Max follows Damien up the steps and into the building
INT BUILDING - SAME

The halls are lined with flickering jack-o-lanterns Max
limps after Damien up the creaky stairs to the second floor
MAX
Sweet Jesus somebody in this building
sure loves Halloween eh boss

DAMIEN
When I want the opinion of a humpback
mongoloid youll be the first to know
Until then keep your sideshow babble to
yourself

MAX
Yes boss Sorry boss

Damien stops before a door adorned with strange voodoo
paraphernalia Loud noises of sex coming from within
Damien pounds on the door and waits

A bald GORILLA-LIKE MAN answers in a filthy bunny costume
Damien pushes him aside and enters--

THE APARTMENT

A filthy packrat heaven More Halloween decorations Piles
of junk old newspapers and garbage Birdcages stuffed with
chickens hang from the ceiling Overfed cats lie everywhere

Sitting among it is an ill-tempered dwarf RONNIE watching
three TVs each playing a different porn film Sitting next
to him is an ARMLESS OLD MAN breathing from an oxygen tank
The Dwarf acknowledges Damien then goes back to watching TV

INT HALLWAY

Max follows Damien down a long hallway Its a taxidermists
dream lined with every dead animal imaginable A dead dog
is crucified to a heavy wooden door at the end of it

Damien snaps his fingers and motions for the bag Max hands
over the bag

DAMIEN
Wait in the car

Max limps back down the hall Damien KNOCKS on the door

GRETCHEN (0S)
Who is it

DAMIEN
Damien

The door opens and Damien enters As the door shuts behind
him PUSH INON the dogs head its eye sockets squirming
with maggots
INT GRETCHENS ROOM - SAME

GRETCHEN HAGGIS an old witch stands opposite Damien over a
bizarre cauldron shaped like a three-headed wolf Swirling
smoke and brilliant beams of light pour forth illuminating
strange sculptures of demonic figures that line the room
These figures seem to come to life when hit with the powerful

light

GRETCHEN
Give it here give it here

Damien opens the bag and removes a bundle wrapped in plastic

DAMIEN
This is the last

GRETCHEN
Yes number thirteen - The circle is now
complete All is as it should be all is

as it shall be

She unwraps the plastic to reveal a BABY It has a second
tiny deformed head growing from its neck Gretchen smiles

GRETCHEN
Mmmm two heads what a little cuter

Gretchen drops the baby in the cauldron and the room explodes
with fiery light As they stare into the vapors their eyes
turn completely white as though they are possessed

GRETCHEN
I see the gods of Kasimordon are smiling
down upon you Damien I see their sharp
pearly teeth stretching back in beautiful
grins They have the answers you seek

Shadowy spirit figures appear in the rising smoke now

DAMIEN
Tell me I must know Ive waited a
lifetime for these answers Are my

dreams truly the shapes of things to
come Have I seen the future

GRETCHEN
Ah the future explain this future

The spirit figures suddenly shoot into Damiens body He
goes into a delusional state
DAMIEN

Yesss the future the beautiful
visions of dead upon dead

MOVE IN TIGHT on Damiens blood red eyes as we--

DISSOLVE TO
A DEATH MONTAGE
--of the worlds terrifying future Diseased bodies lay dead
and dying in the streets DISEASE CONTROL WORKERS in plague

suits collect the bodies and burn them Damien walks among
the horror unaffected Thriving in it

DAMIEN (VO)
Misery upon misery the ground bleeding
beneath my steps in a dying frenzy

DISSOLVE TO
EXT GALLOWS - NIGHT

Several people wait to be hanged at a large wooden gallows

DAMIEN
Brothers and sisters this is a dawning
of a new day The heretics responsible
for our suffering will be exposed and
MORE)
DAMIEN contd)
exterminated We shall punish the guilty
and cleanse our world of Satans
servants

The floor drops open and they fall their necks snapping
collectively like a clapof thunder The crowd ROARS and
chants Damiens name He overlooks them arms raised

DAMIEN (VO)
The power of hate pure untainted
power like a velvet glove cast in
iron clutching the throat of a sick
anemic world a world where the meek
inherit nothing but pain and suffering
constant and eternal

DISSOLVE TO

INT GRETCHENS ROOM - SAME

Lightning crashes then all is normal again The lights
subside the smoke settles Their eyes return to normal

DAMIEN
So it is true

GRETCHEN
Oh yes my brother Damien These are
not mere hallucinations These are the
prophecies

DAMIEN
But when how will I know

GRETCHEN
You will know Soon the jaws of hell
will snap open and the cards of fate will
be dealt You my friend will be one of
the fortunate few dealt a winning hand

Something new in the vapors catches Gretchens attention

GRETCHEN (CONTD)
Hmmm something isnt right

DAMIEN
What What do you see Is there more

GRETCHEN
I see an obstacle Its faint but I
see an adversary
More smoke belches from the cauldron A faint image forms

attractive woman in her mid-30s decorate a Halloween cake

GRETCHEN (V0)
It is a child He is small and frail
but one day he will stand between you and
the legacy of brutality you desire

PUSH IN on the cake its design a skull with wings RIP
written on the forehead and Happy Halloween on the bottom

DAMIEN (VO)
Impossible How can this boy threaten

CUT TO
INT GRETCHENS ROOM - SAME
The image grows hazier before them
GRETCHEN

This I cannot explain But believe what

laughing face of Basil Lightning crashes as we--

Halloween in a black robe and skeleton gloves His MOM
applies skull make-up to his face Basil has a white streak

in his hair and a large band-aid on his forehead

BASIL
A gift-wrapped bat

She winks tweaks his nose Then the doorbell RINGS Basil
jumps up excitedly and runs toward the door

BASIL

MOM
(shouting after him)
See who it is before you open the door

Basil runs down a short hallway to the front door He pulls
up a step stool and looks through the peephole

BASILS POV - THROUGH PEEPHOLE

It looks like a father and son trick-or-treating The father
is dressed as a devil in a red hooded robe a grinning mask
covering his face His son is in a creepy-looking clown suit
BACK TO BASIL

--stepping off the stool and opening the door The clown

just stares at Basil The devil peers inside to see if
anyone else is home
BASIL
Hey Bozo youre supposed to say trick
or treat
the clown just stares)
I cant give you any candy until you say
trick or treat Thats the rule

The clown opens his sack and sings in a deep adult voice
CLOWN

Trick or treat smell my feet give me
something good to eat

The clown -- actually Ronnie -- throws his sack over Basils
head and carries him kicking and screaming inside the
apartment The devil -- actually Damien -- shuts the door

Mom screams as they burst into the TV room with Basil

MOM

DAMIEN

(stops mortified)
Please dont hurt him Take whatever you

DAMIEN

to the clown)
Take the bag off his head Let the poor
boy enjoy his last few breaths among the

living
The clown removes the bag Basils make-up is now smeared
with sweat running down his face -- like the Crow make-up

Hes in a state of shock numbly staring at the TV

DAMIEN (CONTD)
So this is my arch rival

His mother gets on her knees to beg for mercy sobbing
MOM

UNCLE WOLFIE

Bride of Frankenstein

Basil freaks out and breaks free of Ronnie Crawls to his
dead mothers side He curls up with her lifeless body the
TV flickering behind them

DAMIEN

RONNIE

DAMIEN (CONTD)

PRETORIUS toasting the FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER

DR PRETORIUS
MO )
To a new world of gods and monsters

Theses words catch Damiens attention He laughs
DAMIEN
Well my dear Basil I do believe the
accursed idiot box has blessed you with a

most fitting epitaph
BASILS POV

--looking up at Damien as he lowers his gun straight into the
camera smiling

DAMIEN
To a new world of gods and monsters

Damien fires The scene EXPLODES RED Dark viscous blood
drops down the screen forming into the following words

WORDS ON SCREEN
In the long years that followed the
skies turned dark and cold Plague and
famine ravaged the land The forces of
evil grew and spread turning the world
into an unholy black planet of hell

As the words take shape the background shifts into abstract
silhouettes of a young boy rising from the grave

The words dissolve The screen FADES TO BLACK A new title
card comes up TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS LATER

CUT TO

EXT TANGLEWOOD BORDER - NIGHT

Heavy rain falls on a dense black forest Fog thick as soup
hovers over the ground Scattered tombstones and monuments
stick through like skyscrapers breaking a low cloud layer

A dark ghostly figure on a jet-black horse materializes out
of the fog It is Basil now a grown man cloaked in black
with a large pilgrim-style hat A CROW sits on his shoulder

As he gallops the crow takes flight and swoops toward us

BASIL (VO)
Its strange the things we remember and
the things our minds choose to forget I

can remember like it was only yesterday
scratching and crawling through the filth
and decay the hideous blackness
surrounding me the cold rush of night
air washing over me as I broke the
surface Every object once-familiar
loomed alien It was as if while Id

(MORE )
BASIL (contd)
been sleeping somebody stole the world
Sometimes fractured images flicker
through my mind disconnected from

reality Forgotten memories or
hallucinations - I dont know I feel
like a ghost haunting my own dreams A

dead soul in search of itself

Another shadow rider emerges from the mist behind Basil

This is FATS a portly bloke in his mid-50s Dressed in
worn brown leathers hooded black poncho His entire body is
covered by a black skeleton tattoo including a black skull
on his face

They pull their horses off the trail dismount and tie them
to a large cross-shaped headstone

Basil moves his head from side to side just over the fog

BASIL
Hes close I feel a rumbling in my
bones

FATS

Which way

Basil motions over a rise then quickly moves off that way
Fats follows Trips over a headstone

FATS
Bleedin fog

ANGLE - BASIL

Well ahead of Fats moving deftly through the graveyard to a
broken down mausoleum He sees the silhouette of a man
seemingly ducked behind a headstone over the next rise

He pulls his gun cocks it as Fats catches up to him huffing
and puffing He is about to say something but Basil puts a

finger to his lips and points to the mans form

Fats draws his gun They separate circling up and around
both sides of the man

FOLLOW BASIL

--moving like a shadow among the graves He slips up behind
the man puts the gun to his head
BASIL
Statue time Billy boy

Then he sees blood spattered all over the gravestone as Fats
arrives

FATS
Got him

Basil nods then prods the mans head with the barrel of his
gun It slumps to the side Hes dead Eyes gouged out
mouth frozen open in a scream

FATS
Christ something tore his bloody windows
out
(beat)
Whatta you think Tomb rippers

BASIL
Hell I dont know Guess old Billy Goat
was just hanging in the wrong place at
the wrong time

FATS
Ten large dont come any easier than
this

BASIL

(gestures past Fats)
Maybe he can’ shed some light on the
situation

Basil points to another BODY behind Fats face down in the
dirt and partially obscured by a large headstone Empty
booze bottles strewn around him clothes soaked with blood

Fats goes over and lifts up the dead mans head by the hair
His eyes are also gone Theres a row of bats TATTOOED
around his neck

FATS
Shit its fucking Joey Bats Drunk as a
skunk and dead as a nail Bloody
terminal mate

Fats happily starts searching through his pockets for money

BASIL
You know this guy
FATS
Yeah Joeys a minor tracker out of Ten
Oaks Specializes in personal hits

Basil scans the graveyard warily The wind HOWLS between the
headstones and skeletal tree limbs

BASIL
Theres too much fresh meat in this
boneyard Lets knock Billys block and
call it a day before we wear out our
welcome

FATS
Sure sure Ill just relieve Mr Bats
here of any valuables he wont be needing
anymore then its happy trails

Basil draws his sword and methodically brings it down just
off screen in the bg (we hear a KA-CHUK) As he does
Fats finds a flyer in one of Bats pockets His eyes light
up as he reads it He whistles impressed

FATS
Bingo

Fats hands the flyer to Basil
CLOSE ON - THE FLYER

WANTEDDEAD OR ALIVE HELVIS AND ALL MEMBERS OF DISGRACELAND
SEVEN Under this are photos of each decrepit member

BACK TO BASIL AND FATS

FATS
Can you believe it Sixty large for
hauling in those fucking back-alley
pillocks

Basil folds and pockets the flyer

BASIL
Dont start spending it yet Chubs
Every skank hunter within five hundred
miles will be looking to snag these cats
so I suggest we get a move-on

FATS
Alright but I wanna eyeball the map
first
BASIL
Last I heard Helvis was banging out of
Hellgate

CUT TO
EXT GRAVEYARD - SAME
Basil carries Billys head by the hair and puts it in an old
leather sack strapped over his horses back He ties it off
and mounts up

INT MAUSOLEUM

Fats has unrolled his map on top of an exposed coffin He
lights a match to illuminate it

FATS
were here Hollowbrook follows up to
there Hellgate should be about

EXT GRAVEYARD - SAME

Basil waits on his horse He pulls out a cigar Bites off
the end and spits it out Using his hat to block the rain
he strikes a match with his thumbnail and lights it

The match illuminates his face For the first time we
clearly see his ghostly white face And more importantly
the white streak in his black hair

He doesnt notice the THREE FIGURES slowly approaching from
behind as he shouts above the rain

BASIL
Whats the story old man You reading
the map or playing with the stiffs

INT MAUSOLEUM

FATS
Piss off Im trying to have a jolly
little go “round with a stiff little
sweetie mate And if you dont mind
wed appreciate a little bloody privacy

Sludge from the leaky tomb drips onto the map He brushes it
off annoyed Basil shouts from outside

BASIL (0S)
Say your goodbyes Chubs Helvis and his
greasers aint gonna wait forever
FATS
Hey steady your bollocks Im tryin to

find us a short--

A new plop of sludge lands right on his match plunging him
into darkness

FATS (OVER BLACK)
Bloody hell

EXT GRAVEYARD - SAME
Basil still hasnt noticed the Ghouls now only inches away

BASIL
Whatd you say

INT MAUSOLEUM

Fats strikes another match just as a huge splash of chud
lands on his head

FATS
What the--

He raises the match and looks up to the rafters to discover
three more GHOULS At first they look like corpses but when
the light hits them their eyes pop openand they let out an
unholy SCREECHING HISS

FATS (CONTD)
Jesus Christ Basil

Fats steps back -- only to bump into another Ghoul It
reaches out and throttles him as--

EXT GRAVEYARD - SAME

Before Basil can respond he is ambushed by the three ghouls
who pull him down off his horse He lands on his back with
the ghouls swarming trying to tear the flesh from his bones

But they are no match for Basils lightning-quick reflexes
In one smooth motion he throws them off leaps to his feet
and draws his sword He slices it into the neck of the
closest ghoul killing it

Without turning Basil jabs his sword behind him cutting
deep into the cold heart of the second ghoul
INT MAUSOLEUM

Fats fights for his life A child-ghoul hangs from his back
as he drives a jagged piece of wood from the smashed coffin
through the heart of another He reaches behind him and
throws the child-ghoul across the room impaling it on the
horns of a gargoyle sculpture

EXT GRAVEYARD

Covered in blood Basil is slices and dices everything in his
path to the mausoleum in attempt to assist his friend

INT MAUSOLEUM

Two new ghouls try to enter the mausoleum Fats charges them
head-on grabbing each one by the throat

EXT GRAVEYARD

Basil beheads the last of his pack of ghouls then hears a
mighty ROAR Turns to see Fats explode from the mausoleum

with each ghoul gripped by the throat

Before Basil can run to his aid a pair of arms burst from
the ground grabbing hold of his legs

BASIL
Fats Get their heads up

The ghouls are kicking and screaming wildly in Fats grip

FATS
Im trying mate I aint doing a bloody
jig over here

Basil pulls two daggers strapped to his forearms and skewers
them into the head of the ghoul beneath his feet

FATS (CONTD)
Let em have it kid I cant hold these
geezers much longer

Basil takes both daggers and lets fly scoring a direct hit
into the back of each ghouls head They fall like rag dolls
from Fats hands Fats is left wheezing exhausted

BASIL
You alright old man
FATS
Sod those daft buggers were hungry

BASIL
Whatta you expect Shit youre a ten
course meal

Basil yanks his daggers from their heads

BASIL (contd)
Lets go

CUT TO
EXT GRAVEYARD - SHORTLY

They have impaled the dead ghouls on a rusted iron gate in
front of the mausoleum Basil lights a torch

FATS
Im too bloody old to be knocking about
for sport All this free killing it
just dont sit well with me

BASIL
I know why do for free

FATS
(finishing the sentence)
what you can get bloody well paid for

Basil lights the bodies on fire They mount their horses

BASIL
Always good to leave a little calling
card behind

FATS
Damn straight boy Theyll make a hell
of a fine lunch for the rats and ruggers
(howling)
Aaaooo Burn baby burn

The CROW swoops down and lands on Basils shoulder as they
ride into the fog LINGER on the raging funeral pyre and--

turns and walks up the stairs to--

THE GUILLOTINE STAGE

Scagg joins his right-hand man LT COMMANDER ZERBE as the
soldiers drag the woman up the main steps
The hooded EXECUTIONER straps the woman into the guillotine
As she struggles we notice she is missing a finger

smiling down at the governor

CUT TO

A semi-nude animatronic girl rides a mechanical monster above
a huge neon sign that says HELLGATE TILT DOWN to see the
sign is suspended above the entrance to Hellgates borders

Life inside these walls is a deadly mix of the lawlessness of

Tombstone Arizona circa 1881
modern-day Las Vegas

the way Hellgates citizens like it

and the glamorous decadence of
Anarchy reigns supreme and thats just
EXT HAUNTED PALACE - NIGHT

Another flashing neon sign reads THE HAUNTED PALACE
Below that their slogan pulses GIRLS GUTS AND GUNS
Loud bottom-heavy music pumps from within

INT HAUNTED PALACE - NIGHT

The SCREAMING FACE of a big ugly BRUTE fills the frame as he
slams his head right into the camera

The Brutes forehead splits the nose of another THUG who
slumps to the ground The crowd CHEERS the victor

ANGLE - DANCING GIRLS

GO-GO GIRLS in leopard suits gyrate to the music on raised
platforms oblivious to the violence around them

Basil says nothing Just takes a match strikes it against
the side of Sonnys head and lights his cigar

SONNY
Oh youre dead as dead can be

Sonny whips out a meat cleaver and swings it at Basil In
one smooth move Basil ducks spins and draws his sword
stabbing it right through Sonnys heart

Red jumps back draws his gun and fires Basil yanks the
sword back out of Sonny using the blade to deflect the
bullets Gun empty Red runs Basil throws his sword
nailing Red through the back to a go-go platform The girl
dancingabove remains unfazed

High atop a desolate hill is the forbidding structure of
CASTLE BLACK home of Damien Finch

INT DAMIENS CHAMBERS

The master chamber is decorated with the finest comforts that
money can buy Bizarre antiques and twisted art objects
clutter the room creating a chamber of horrors atmosphere

PANNING ACROSS the room we come to rest on a disturbing
still life yoUNG GIRLS resembling the BRIDES OF DRACULA are
arranged with a ghastly combination of props ranging from
headless bodies to crucified animals Adding to the macabre
scene is Damiens SINGING Serenade from FAUST

Damien stands before a large canvas painting this very
scene Now in his 70s he is still a striking figure with
glicked-back hair and a long Fu Manchu-style mustache and
eard
Holding his palette is LADY CLEOPATRA one of his many dark
and beautiful wives

INT CASTLE HALLWAY - SAME

Captain Scagg comes down the long stone corridor with two
MASKED GUARDS in demonic armor dragging a bound and gagged
Governor Hoyt behind them He stops at Damiens imposing
wooden door and knocks

After a beat a panel in the door slides open Cleopatara
stares back at Scagg with a look of disgust The panel slaps
shut and the door opens Scagg enters--

DAMIENS CHAMBERS

They drag the squirming Governor before Damien who remains
mostly preoccupied by his painting

CAPT SCAGG
Master Finch may I present the honorable
Governor Reginald Hoyt

DAMIEN

Ah Governor Hoyt So nice of you to
come I hope youll excuse me if I

continue with my work I have so little
time to indulge myself in the finer

things in life

GOVERNOR HOYT
You scum-sucking swine Ill see you rot
in hell The people will not stand for
this

DAMIEN
Hmmmm somethings missing from this
composition what could it be
Then his eyes land on a small box on a table
DAMIEN (CONTD)
Ah yes Cleo my dear If you would be

so kind

Cleopatra opens a boxit and pulls out the Governors wifes
head and sets it among the display

The Governor struggles to break free but its useless
GOVERNOR HOYT
You filthy animal I11 kill you

DAMIEN
I grow weary of these psychotic
ramblings Deliver this insufferable

bore to Moorehead Ill be down shortly

The guards drag the screaming Governor out the door Damien
returns to his painting a thin smile stretching his lips

In the middle of this mechanical hell is Governor Hoyt now
barely alive and strapped to an ancient operating table
Tubes and wires are connected all over his body

An old white-haired man ina lab coat DR THURL MOOREHEAD
inserts a small steel rod into the Governors head

Damien walks in grinning Followed by two of his brides
They take a white gown and cover his ornate clothing

DAMIEN
Are we ready Dr Moorehead

DR MOOREHEAD
Yes I do believe we are

Moorehead steps up to the board and throws a switch The
Governors eyes pop open He looks around the room wide
awake now He sees Damien grinning

DAMIEN
Well well good day Governor Whats
wrong having a rough day
The Governor struggles to speak but a small metal cage holds
his jaws shut

DAMIEN

I was thinking Reginald Or can I call
you Reggie Hmmmmmn

The Governor stares in horror The brides laugh

DAMIEN

(contd)
Being the cultured man that I am Id
hate to make a social blunder What the
hell Im feeling rather bold today
Ill just assume it proper So anyway
Reggie Ive never considered myself a
cruel man only a clever one So you
see I had no choice but to feed your
lovely wifes head to the worms

The Governors eyes burn red The brides giggle in delight

DAMIEN
(contd)
And to prove to you Im not such a bad
guy after all Ive decided to bury your

head in the same hole Now I think
thats truly sporting of me

DR MOOREHEAD
Yes I do believe that is rather upright
of you

DAMIEN
Now say bye-bye Reggie

THE BRIDES
Bye-bye Reggie

Damien waves to him then Moorehead throws another switch
hard

A surge of electric charges rip through the Governors brain
His eyes turn black Blood gushes from his mouth then his
eyes He lets out a horrible violent scream before slumping
over dead

display of bodily functions

BLASTS from each shotgun

ANGLE - FRONT DOOR

As the shooters turn to see Basil by the window Fats crashes
through whats left of the front door and tackles and
unsuspecting guard

Helvis turns and fires at Fats who uses the guard as a human
shield The guard is killed Fats fires back at Helvis who
dives behind an overturned table

The last remaining bodyguard fires at Basil who takes a

flying leap firing back as he does and nailing the guard in
the chest and splattering him against the wall Basil then
bounces off the bed flips in mid-air and lands on his feet
Suddenly all four Bone Daddy Girls SPOOK MING TURA and
ZIRA pull swords that ignite into blue flames The girls
split off Spook and Ming on Fats Tura and Zira on Basil

Fats fires at the attacking girls but his bullets cant
penetrate the strokes of the flaming swords Fats drops his
guns and draws his own sword and the girls lunge at him

MING
Aint no Black Rider gonna bust in here
and rip us up

Fats blocks their swords with his all three connecting with
a flash of electricity Fats shoves the girls backwards

Meanwhile Basil fences off Tura and Ziras lightning fast
swings He knocks Turas sword out of her grasp flipping it
up into the ceiling which ignites instantly

Fats is backed against a wall savagely trading blow for blow
with his opponents The room is now ablaze with fallout from
the flaming swords Spook dives and swings Fats ducks and
her sword lodges in the wall Fats seizes his chance and
drives his sword through her gut

Spook grabs hold of his sword and stumbles back Fats grabs
her flaming sword from the wall and continues fighting

Zira swings at Basil who jumps back and plunges his sword
into her heart She falls forward onto him He kicks her
back pulling his bloody sword back out as he does

TURA
Noooooo

Tura leaps onto Basil knocking him halfway out the window
He struggles while Tura clings trying to slash his throat

Helvis seizes the opportunity to flee escaping through
another window and up the fire escape to the roof

Basil sees Helvis getting away and flips Tura backwards out
the window She falls screaming to her death

The room is now completely filled with fire and smoke Part

He sees Helvis sneaking up behind Fats from behind the

Basil spins and fires directly at Fats who drops like a sack

INT BOSHIS BODY

Basil is trapped against the glowing undulating walls of
flesh The dripping acid walls burn his skin melting his
skin like wax

Then the walls of flesh expand into a long tunnel At the
end is a swirling vortex of light Basil stumbles toward it

But with each step he is hit by a CHARGE OF ELECTRICITY from
the walls of flesh Each JOLT triggers a FLASHBACK

ZAP-- he sees himself as a little boy standing with his
mother at his fathers funeral

ZAP-- he sees the devil-masked killer shooting his mother
ZAP-- he sees himself falling dead

ZAP-- he sees himself as a little boy emerging from the
grave

BACK TO BASIL - IN THE BOSHI

Struggling screaming scratching and clawing his way to the
light Tears stream from his eyes and down his face as the
horrific revelations continue

Z-Z-Z-ZZZAAP-- a new flood of IMAGERY bombards him now
Chaotic scenes of people being burnt hanged and beheaded
Screaming tortured faces of the victims

Standing high above the smoke and fire is the devil-masked
killer from Basils childhood memory The killer removes the
mask to reveal a real devil

He starts to laugh maniacally PULL BACK to see him now
standing in Basils apartment holding a gun directly at the

CAMERA

As he FIRES the gun--
BACK TO BASIL - IN THE BOSHI

Basil drops to his knees as he strives to reach the light
but it seems impossibly far away Then as he lies there
the shape of an ANGEL appears within the light and transforms
into a luminous CROW

With a determined SCREAM Basil struggles to his feet The
crow flies toward him He reaches for it and takes hold
There is a tremendous burst of light as Basil and the crow
become one The inner fleshy walls of the Boshi collapse in

--as we fly over barren countryside we descend toward a
solitary building on a desolate patch of land -- a small
country inn

I remember standing in the cemetery
looking down over my daddys coffin
Hell it was raining so hard the water
was filling his grave

PUSH IN CLOSER to the sign swinging on creaky chains out
front It reads THE NOSFERATU INN -- a crude painted
vampire with bat wings framing the letters

BASIL (V0)
My mama pointed up at the sky to a big
black crow circling over us I could
barely see it the water was stinging my
eyes SO bad She said it was here to
take daddys soul to heaven

The crow lands atop the sign head jerking toward the inn

from Bela Lugosi murals to coffin-shaped furniture

Basil and Fats are seated in a dark corner of the crowded
inn eating off of a miniature casket-shaped table The top
is made of glass so one can see the tiny corpse inside

The two have just finished a huge meal The table is full of
empty glasses plates and bowls Basil torches a cigar in
the middle of telling Fats the story weve been hearing

BASIL (CONTD)
she said hed wait for us to join him
up there Well I know my mama made it
but I never did

Fats just looks at him Takes a long pull off a bottle of
brew Hes having trouble with all of this
FATS
You really think those flashes were the
real deal now Baz Not just your head
goin loopy I mean being swallowed by
a fucking mutos gotta screw with your
mind in a big way

BASIL
Shit you think I dont know how insane

(beat)

But my past all those years before you
found me meant nothing a blank slate
Now I remember All the pieces of the
jigsaw are sliding into place I
remember it all

FATS

You know they say some fucked-up shit
goes down when you almost die like that
Brain starts playing tricks on ya see

FATS

BASIL
Look I know I aint some slab jockey
wandering the boneyards Im something

Very abruptly Basil draws his knife and stabs it through his
own hand nailing it to the table Fats jumps back in shock

FATS
Jesus What the--

Basil stares at him calmly feeling no pain He pulls the
knife out and holds up his gashed hand

It heals itself Within moments the wound is gone
BASIL
I got no wounds from the acid burns

either

Fats can only stare He blinks once Twice Slumps back

into his seat
FATS
Jesus Mary and Joseph I need a bloody
pint and a half

As if in answer a pretty BARMAID comes by with more drinks
Fats smiles at her

FATS
Thanks lass

Fats takes a long swig Basil just stares at his hand
curiously burning it with his cigar and watching it heal

over and over

FATS (CONTD)
I knew you were an odd little bugger when
I found ya wandering the graves in
your sunday best without a clue who ya
were or where ya came from But I never
pegged you for a bleedin corpse thats

(re Basils burning himself)

Willya knock that repulsive shit off
before I chuck me fraggin guts

BASIL

The crow lands in the window next to Fats staring in at
Basil Fats watches Basil staring back Sensing their
unique connection

FATS
You think your mum was right That the
crow takes the dead up to heaven

BASIL
I got no reason to doubt it

FATS

YOUNG BASIL (as he was at his death) wanders in the rain He
is cold and dirty still wearing the suit he was buried in

Then a CROW lands on a tombstone calling out to him He
stumbles toward it but the bird takes flight

FOLLOW the crow darting like a bullet straight up into the

rainy night sky It hits its apex encircled by a FULL MOON
The clouds part the stars emerge The crow descends back
to--

THE GRAVEYARD

--where it swoops down to land on the shoulder of the adult
Basil He is sitting atop a tall monument perched high
above the rest of the cemetery deep in thought The distant
lights of the Nosferatu Inn are visible in the valley below

This is a different graveyard than the one young Basil was
wandering through This one is decrepit crumbling
backdropped by the ruins of an old fire-ravaged town

Basil hops off the tall monument landing with the grace of a
cat The crow takes flight heading back toward the valley

She winks and walks away Fats can hardly believe it He
goes double-time on the hamhocks hardly bothering to chew
the food as he gulps it down

He stops when Scagg and the Guards burst in They dont see
Fats among the dense crowd but he sees them They start
shoving PATRONS around asking questions

But he stops at the stairs upon hearing a scream He turns
back to see the brave Patron dead on the floor a sword in

flashes of the slaughter that has transpired as he enters and
runs--

At the top a corpse comes swinging out of the darkness
Basil dodges it and continues to--

tarred and feathered and spiked to the wall A note is
nailed to its head

Basil approaches terrified this is Fats But no this man
is far too thin to be Fats Relieved but only for the
moment Basil yanks off the note and reads it

Down to his knees the fat one fell
Black death comes swift the screaming
did tell True pain and suffering ring so
clear The gnawing of teeth is all he
could hear He cried out your name with
weak shallow breath For I am his Lord

rage Then he turns and heads out with a vengeance

Let the power of their agony fuel my

and wide insane eyes laughing mouths and worming tongues as
we return abruptly back to--

the DEAD begin to rise from the altar and circle over him
before being sucked into his convulsing body

More and more emerge Faster and faster they are consumed

heavens Until

TARKIS THORN

Tarkis jumps down from his horse and swipes through the
water Hives and Basil jump down to help in the search

Further down Israfel breaks though the surface of the water
in the clutches of a SWAMP CANNIBAL She reaches into the
water comes back with a knife She spins and jams it up
under the creatures jaw stabbing it up into its brain She
drops its dead body back into the water

She turns to them proud victory written all over her face

ISRAFEL
Ha
(her face falls)
Holy sh--

She is looking behind the boys who turn to see more SWAMP
CANNIBALS rising from the water all around them The horses
buck and bolt off as the creatures launch a savage attack

But the highly skilled team of warriors snaps into action
even faster Basils sword dances through the air as he
seems to fight all sides at once

Tarkis Thorn unloads an endless wall of gunfire into the
onrushing creatures ripping them to pieces

Dr Hives unleashes a barrage of long slender spikes from
his crossbow

Israfels arms are moving fast as airplane propellers
letting her knives rip into the throats heads and hearts of
the attacking slime

Within mere moments the four have killed them all Everyone
is now dripping wet with mud
TARKIS THORN
Everyone alright Ange

ISRAFEL
Im alright

DR HIVES
Fine fine I must say that was a bit of
a surprise but overall quite
exhilarating yes

He turns to Basil who is shucking off swamp slime as he
trudges back to his horse

TARKIS THORN

BASIL
Dont worry about me Slicing up
mudwalkers is a nice way to stretch ye
old killing muscles

Tarkis smiles slaps him on the shoulder

INT DAMIENS CHAMBERS - NIGHT
A montage of witch trial executions and general mayhem plays
over the witch-powered screen Before it LADY CLEOPATRA
dances and mimes to SCRATCHY MUSIC from an old record

DAMIEN (VO)

Ha ha ha the world dies screaming
under my devil-lights In a moment of
fantastic whim I whisper a question to

your ears
PULL BACK TO REVEAL Damien is at the center of a huge feast
Cleopatra and his HAREM OF BRIDES surround him dancing on

the table and frolicking about the room The horrible sights
onscreen seem only to fuel Damiens appetite

Suspended spread-eagled and face down over the table ina
hideous device is Fats Suspended next to him in the same
fashion is an unconscious COUNSELOR RIGGS

DAMIEN
like dead limbs waiting for the
needle for the puncture of sweet
sweet embalming life I ask you
gentlemen do you really understand what
a privilege it is to dine in my presence

FATS
(weakly)
Christ kill me now I cant bear
another bloody minute of this holier-
than-thou spook-show horseshit

Hearing this the room falls silent All eyes turn to
Damien No one dares speak Then Damien begins to laugh and

all join in Abruptly he stops

DAMIEN
Silence you witless whores Do not try
to silhouette yourselves against my
visions my revelations of the new
world cryptic

He picks up a large knife and turns to Fats

DAMIEN (CONTD)
You fancy yourself quite the little court
jester dont you

FATS
cant rightly help it with a bloody
pompous twit like yourself wagging his
long-winded tongue all over the room

DAMIEN
Hmmm speaking of wagging tongues

He toyingly places the knife blade against Fats face
running it down along his jawline

DAMIEN (CONTD)
Perhaps youd like me to remove yours
through your throat
Damien slides the knife down to Fats throat pressing
harder drawing a bead of blood But Fats does not show
fear In fact he manages a grin

FATS
Do it you sick twist And put me poor
ears outta their bleedn misery

Damien is now clearly frustrated with the big man He looks
like hes going to finish him off but a sudden MOAN from
the waking Counselor Riggs diverts him

DAMIEN
Well it seems our dear Counselor would
like to comment on our current state of
affairs

As Riggs fully wakes he takes in the horrifically seductive
Cleo and her brides staring up at him salivating greenish-
yellow drool Ready to feast

And all at once he realizes he is the feast

He just loses it screaming hysterically as Damien and the
Brides explode into bone-chilling peals of laughter As the
Counselor screams harder -- they laugh harder

DAMIEN

( still chortling)
Well put Counselor Well put

more laughter)
Ladies I believe the time has come for
the Counselor to take a more
interactive role in this evenings
festivities

With that any trace of mad glee vanishes from Damiens face
-- replaced by the cold savage lust of a killer

He rushes forward and slices open Counselor Riggs belly
His blood drips down like the devils rain

DAMIEN (CONTD)
Drink my children Drink of the
lifeblood Feast upon the righteous fool
who dared stand before me

Cleo and the Brides rush forth to bathe in the Counselors
blood They lap it up from the tables surface like thirsty
kittens at bowls of cream

Israfel looks up river where Hives is pointing to see
several lumpy masses bobbing in the sludge As they move
closer it is clear that they are decomposed corpses

Ack its disgusting
DR HIVES

Youll get used to it

The passageway grows ever-tighter Israfel reaches out to
steady her self against a wall and brings a row of previously
concealed corpses falling down on top of her

Israfel SCREAMS as the bodies topple over her knocking her
below the surface
Hives hurries over reaching under the bodies and dragging a
gagging Israfel back to safety

DR HIVES

Dont worry my dear just a little dead
meat yes

TARKIS THORN
You alright back there

ISRAFEL
steeling herself again)
No problem just a slight corpse
avalanche

Neither Hives nor Israfel notice another DEAD BODY rising
behind them -- this one with GLOWING RED EYES

But Basil and Tarkis do see it and react -- each putting a
bullet through the monsters head The body gushes SLIMY
OOZE onto Hives before slipping back beneath the surface

BASIL
Sorry ‘bout that Doc

No apology necessary my boy Its all

Deep inside the shadows of the cage a huge figure stirs As
it moves into the light we see the hulking hairy mass of
beast called HURONIMOS Standing seven feet tall its

description falls somewhere between a gorilla and Bigfoot

Styles and Dudley shovel the human stew into the cell through
a small dinner door Suddenly Huronimos lunges at the
door grabbing Dudleys arts and pulling him against the cage
DUDLEY

Styles tries to pull him free but Huronimos is too strong

STYLES

Dr Moorehead just holds up his hands calm as a banker

DR MOOREHEAD
These are delicate instruments my boy
I cant risk damaging my livelihood

Huronimos releases Dudley who discovers his arm has been
ripped off Blood spurts from the gaping wound at his

shoulder His SCREAMS echo throughout the corridor
STYLES
Doctor Stop the bleeding

BLAM-BLAM-BLAM Dudley slumps over dead Three bullet
holes in his head The blood spurting from his arm slows tc

stands ready to meet its charge But then Tarkis steps up
beside him

Tarkis and Huronimos charge each other like rams about to
lock horns fThen Tarkis forgoes his sword and dives at
Huronimos locking his hands around his neck in a death grip

TARKIS THORN

Huronimos shifts getting Tarkis in an equally unbreakable
bear hug

Hives and Israfel come forward to help their friend but
Basil holds them off for the moment

Blood begins to run from Tarkis nose as the pressure builds
Then with a mighty HOWL Tarkis clenches his fingers with
his last bit of strength We HEAR something SNAP

Huronimos wavers a beat arms falling to his side Tarkis
lands on the floor as Huronimos falls with a echoing thud
Dr Moorehead and Styles cant believe their eyes They turn

Hives comes up behind the servant and plunges a knife into
his neck Then takes his keys as Israfel joins him

from the ring and approaches the door

CUT TO
INT WITCHES LAIR - NIGHT

In this private hell we see how the witches relax Some are
asleep in their shabby cots while others watch a crumbling
old bandw movie projected on the wall

But the main attraction is the autopsy of Governor Hoyt being
performed in the center of the room

FOCUS ON the door as the lock CLICKS quietly The knob
slowly turns The door slowly swinging open

The witches pay no attention intent on the autopsy

But then the door CREAKS LOUDLY All the witches turn their
hockles bristling

But the doorway is empty One WITCH goes to investigate
Just as she gets there Israfel appears letting her knife
fly skewering the witch through the throat She takes her
down and TWISTS the knife to cut the head clean off

The other witches move in but Dr Hives is there wielding
his sword swinging like a dervish He slices through one
witch after the next Israfel backs him up daggers flying

DRHIVES
Keep em flying Angel

ISRAFEL
I got ‘em

They are a well-practiced team For each one Israfel puts
down with a dagger Dr Hives is sure to slice off the head
They move through the room with great efficiency

But they miss one witch lying apparently dead a knife
through her heart She rises regenerated and jumps onto
Dr Hives back clawing wildly

DR HIVES
Aaaaarrrghhh Get it off me

Then --WHACK-- Israfel appears behind her cutting her head
off with a single swing of her blade Hives turns to realize
his close call

DR HIVES
You have my deepest gratitude young
lady
ISRAFEL
looking beyond him)

across the room She is as frightening as weve ever seen
her -- fierce in her outrage at this slaughter She SCREAMS

Slides it in through the keyhole and activates the tiny

a wisp echoing laughter in his wake

Basil turns to see Damien standing on the other side of the
garden

DAMIEN

friend

The ground rumbles under Basils feet A huge black cross
erupts before him rising high into the pitch black night
sky towering over him

Crucified to it is Fats He appears to be dead Basil
stares up at his friend stunned and mortified

BASIL

Damien re-materializes behind Basil

DAMIEN
Oh dont worry hes alive Twisted
broken and suffering through the darkest

meaningless

Besides you my boy are in no position to

promise to kill you quick
Damien is taken aback then bursts into laughter

well as your life You cant kill me

Basil squares off with his sword

Basil charges again but Damien vanishes again Basil turns
searching in frustration when a deep eerie all-too-
familiar VOICE rises from the darkness

You are mine Gorgon

The demons of Kasimordon emerges from the depths of the
garden twisted arms snake out to grab Basils arms and legs
As he struggles against their tenacious grip the world
around him begins to spin uncontrollably The garden gives
way to another place altogether it gives way to--

note-- at this point the action takes place in a grainy band
w silent movie style)

Basil now finds himself standing in a weird alien graveyard
Thick fog hugs the ground twisting around the headstones

They cling to the cage bars as the floor opens completely
The three Gretchens dancing around them cackling with glee

The cage itself begins to lower into the pit Hungry arms
reaching up for their human prey Israfel throws a panicked
look at Hives but he has no solution They draw their
swords-and slash desperately at the nearest hands and arms as

anticipates his move and sidesteps gashing Tarkis across the
shoulder incapacitating his right arm

Tarkis spins tosses the sword into his left hand and
continues fighting Their swords clash Tarkis drives Scagg
back against the wall But Scagg kicks his legs out and
Tarkis goes down

Scagg slashes him across the leg Tarkis drops his sword
which goes clattering down the stairs He staggers against
the wall unable to stand

Scagg grins closing in Hes won this battle and hes going
to enjoy it “

Just as Scagg goes to finish him off Tarkis notices he is
standing under a huge DEMON-HEADED SCULPTURE hanging from the
ceiling -- a rope tying it off on the wall He draws a knife
from his boot and slashes at the rope
Scagg looks up to see the sculpture crashing down on him He
doesnt have time to scream Scaggs sword goes skittering
out on impact clattering against the stone wall

Your breeding days are over Scagg

Tarkis pulls himself up the wall and limps over to Scaggs

strands coming up out of the ground like ragweed then a
head a neck shoulders

Harsh recognition registers on Basils face

BASIL
Mother

Indeed Damien is pulling Basils mother from the ground
Her eyes open She stares lovingly at her son
MOM
Basil

She steps out of the dirt her form shedding the dirt and rot
of the grave She stands before him young and pristine
Warm and loving arms extended

MOM (contd)
Oh Baz Ive missed you
BASIL
Mom Whats happening
MOM
Its time to release yourself from the
living Baz To rejoin us
BASIL
Ys
MOM

smiles lovingly)
Your father is waiting for you

BASIL
Dad

Basil stumbles forward in shock dragging his sword His
mother meets him cupping his face in her hands

MOM (contd)
We miss you Baz We love you so much
Now come with me so we can be a family

again

Basil looks long into her dead eyes His emotions running
high But then--

BASIL
You are not my mother

DAMIEN
Destroy him

BASIL
(contd)
Die devil-whore

He rips his sword up and through the body of this being
causing it to revert back to its true form as it dies -- a
FAT HORNED DEMON
Damien trembles with renewed rage and frustration

BASIL
Youre next Damien No more tricks No
more lies Now you die

DAMIEN
Tricks I dont need tricks to defeat
you Ill do it myself

Damien transforms into a moving STONE GOLEM drawing a sword
in each hand Basil lunges at him and the fight begins

Damien swings his powerful swords with the force of a giant
knocking Basil onto his back Damien thrusts the swords at
him while hes down but Basil rolls barely evading the

death blows

The two trade powerful strikes neither able to defeat the
other Sparks fly from their swords as they clash

Kasimordon swells in the bg
KASIMORDON (VO)
( sub-titled)
Enough of this Kill him through me

The ground EXPLODES beneath Basils feet Living rock sweeps

up from the earth and over his body His arms and legs are
frozen within the granite shell his sword halted in mid-
swing He struggles to break free as the rock solidifies

around him with a deep CRACKLING sound

KASIMORDON (VO)
(sub-titled)
Now we are one Finish him

Damien stands over Basil as he did 27 years before
DAMIEN
Once more for old times sake To a new
world of gods and monsters
Upon hearing these words Basils mind FLASHES with the
haunting childhood images of a laughing Damien dressed as

the Devil shooting him and his mother

Basils eyes turn red tearing drops of blood that streak
down his cheeks The streaks resemble the Crow make-up

Damien brings both swords crashing toward Basils head
BASIL
NOOOOO

Basil breaks free from the stone A flash of LIGHTNING
crashes as their swords meet Damien falls back dazed

Basil swings at Damien who blocks the blow stumbling from
its force Damien swings back crossing swords with Basil
who dodges the deflection to either side The swords deflect
off gravestones splitting them in two

Basil stumbles back against a stone gargoyle which springs
to life and grabs him Damien charges forward swords once
again raised to strike

But with a superhuman effort Basil breaks free snapping the
gargoyles arms off Damien plunges his swords into the
gargoyle instead which SCREAMS in a spray of blood

Damien leaves one sword in the gargoyle turns to face Basil
He screams in a strange alien tongue then lunges at him
with all of his remaining strength

Basil meets him head-on The force of their collision
shatters Damiens sword Damien stumbles back weaponless
BASIL

Heres to your new world

Basil brings his sword down As it strikes Damien he
explodes into a million pieces Basil is thrown back by the

force of it

CUT TO
INT CASTLE HALLS - NIGHT
Tarkis is in the heat of battle but being overwhelmed by the
sheer number of ROYAL GUARDS They have him cornered His

sword is flung from his grip They are about to finish him

Then miraculously they EXPLODE and turn to dust dissolving
at his feet Even the dead ones

Tarkis stares at the carnage stunned Then he realizes--

TARKIS THORN
God damn He did it

CUT TO
INT WITCHES LAIR - ZOMBIE PIT - NIGHT

Dr Hives and Israfel fight the army of zombies on the brink
of defeat Zombies have climbed on to the swinging cage and
are swarming them relentlessly

One grabs onto Israfel and drops into the pit with her
Hives lets go diving to his apparent death in a last ditch
attempt to save her

But then the zombies burst into flames falling dead and
quickly turning to dust

Hives and Israfel slump with happy exhaustion

DR HIVES
He did it yes He did it The evil has
lifted

An unholy SCREAM echoes through the tunnels as the flaming
form of Gretchen stumbles into the pit landing hard between

them She writhes for a moment then simply melts like a wax
candle Monstrous ghostly forms rise from her body and fade
ISRAFEL

Ding dong the witch is dead

CUT TO

INT CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Dr Hives and Israfel find Tarkis limping along the wall
trail of blood behind him

ISRAFEL

She runs up to him They embrace

TARKIS THORN
Youre alright Thank God

Tarkis looks over her shoulder as they hug exchanging happy
smiles with Dr Hives Then Israfel pulls back

ISRAFEL
What about Basil

CUT TO
EXT CASTLE BLACK - GARDEN - NIGHT

Basil lies unconscious in the garden his body covered in
blood and ash

TARKIS THORN
There he is over there

Tarkis and Israfel rush up to Basils side
BASILS POV

Its black until he opens his eyes The first sight he sees
are the faces of his comrades smiling down at him

TARKIS THORN
Glory be Hes alive

ISRAFEL
Dont try to move

Basil ignores her looking around the garden and struggling
to sit up

BASIL
Fats wheres Fats

TARKIS THORN
Hes with Hives

CUT TO
INT DAMIENS CHAMBERS - NIGHT

Hives does his best to make the dying Fats as comfortable as
possible holding a cup to his quivering lips

DR HIVES
Try to drink this

Tarkis carries Basil into the room setting him beside the
bed Basil is stricken when he sees his friend

BASIL
Fats

Tarkis signals the others to leave them alone They exit

Fats opens his eyes smiling at the sight of Basil Its a
real effort for him to talk
FATS
mo bout time you got around to
rescuing me I thought youd gone off
and forgotten your best mate

BASIL
You think Id leave you Not a chance
chubby you got all our money

Fats starts to laugh but chokes coughs up blood He pulls
out his money bag from his belt and hands it to Basil

FATS
I love ya kid dont spend it all in

one place
Fats head slumps to the side Hes gone

Basil drops his head onto Fats chest Unbeknownst to him
the vague shadow of a large crow rises from Fats and up to

the heavens
CUT TO

EXT GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

Basil Tarkis Hives and Israfel stand over Fats grave
Israfel kneels before the grave and stabs her sword into the
mound of earth in tribute to the man Hives and Tarkis
follow suit Then they all walk somberly away

Basil remains behind staring down at the grave of his lost
friend He kneels and lays down his sword

The crow swoops down and lands on Basils shoulder

CUT TO

EXT BLACK FOREST - NIGHT

Basil rides alone through the thick fog the crow flying in
his wake

BASIL (V0)
There is only but death once inside the
blackened deep Mysterious life has
nothing now the angels cry the devils
weep And my soul from a shadow this I
will never know From hallow ground I
was taken for I am the CROW

As he rides he seems to disappear We cant quite tell if
hes fading away or being swallowed up by the thick fog
FADE TO BLACK
