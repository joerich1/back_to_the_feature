gun INTO FRAME Slides the barrel into his mouth

INT WELFARE HOTEL SAME TIME
A filthy little room somewhere in the South Bronx The Crazy
Man stands on a mattress the gun still in his mouth At his
feet a Girl is curled her wrists slashed TWO COPS stand in
the doorway crouched guns drawn A standoff in some circle
of metropolitan hell

COP 1
Put it down Slow

The Crazy Man slides the gun out of his mouth Lets it fall
onto the mattress He is grinning

CRAZY MAN
Welcome to the Bantarian Embassy

cur TO
EXT GIANT STADIUM - NIGHT
Taylor sacks Montana for a big loss
THREE FANS leap up in their seats All in their late 30’s
MIKE O’BRIEN an ursine Public Defender with fiery eyes

ALAN LOWENTHAL a meticulous conservative psychiatrist and
in between them

ISAAC BARR another psychiatrist somewhat less meticulous
and conservative

Through the din Isaac realizes that his beeper is BEEPING
BENEATH THE STANDS

As Isaac moves past the hot dog vendors toward the nearest
exit Beneath the cantilevered rows of stands he passes a
strange skinny MAN who spasmodically jerks -- a marionette
going cold turkey - to the rise and fall of the fans’ ROAR
INT TAXI - NIGHT (MOVING)

Isaac has pulled an electric shaver from his briefcase He
runs it over his cheeks as the cab hurtles downtown

It’s hard to get an even shave as the cab drops into deep
potholes and bounces out again

Now he stuffs the shaver back into his case as the cab pulls
up in front of Bellevue Hospital

CABBIE
I used to be in there They threw me
out That was wrong I shouldn’t be
driving this cab I’m a crazy person
As Isaac hands over the fare

ISAAC
Y’have to be crazy to drive a cab

curt TO
INT HOLDING AREA - SAME TIME

Teeming with loud angry lunatics Every seat is taken even
a couple of stretchers

Guarded by a bored and hulking C0 a NURSE takes the pulse
of the handcuffed Crazy Man

CRAZY MAN
Theres no need for that My pulse
rate is twenty

c0
Sounds more like your IQ

Provoked the Crazy Man springs at the big C0 The CO
steps back and whallops the Crazy man with a ham-fist

INT PRISON WARD ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Isaac reaches the first of three heavy steel gates with the
emblem NYC Department of Corrections bolted to it

TSAAC
Crack the gate
INT HOLDING AREA - A MINUTE LATER

Crazy Man is being guarded now by TWO c0’s A fresh bruise
on his cheek

Isaac entering immediately notices the bruise He and the
c0’s trade tense looks Now soft but emphatic

ISAAC
Well be okay

Your call
Reluctantly the two C0’s exit

Isaac sits on the bench opposite Crazy Man who regards him
with cold slitted eyes

ISAAC
Do you understand that you’re ina
hospital and that it’s a special kind
of hospital

The Crazy Man just glares
ISAAC

It’s a prison Do you understand that
youre going to be charged

CRAZY MAN
I’m already charged with ions from
Bantar
ISAAC
Bantar
CRAZY MAN
The planet
ISAAC

What I mean is do you understand why
youre here

CRAZY MAN
To prepare for the landing This
facility will make a suitable
headquarters

Isaac considers this It doesn’t make sense
TSAAC

Youd think they’d want something
closer to midtown
Crazy Man stares at Isaac Now the hint of a smile

CRAZY MAN
Youve been to Bantar haven’t you

ISAAC
(shrugs)
Only on business
INT NURSING STATION - NIGHT - LATER

Isaac raids the med closet as a pretty duty nurse (FRANKLIN)
makes notations in her charts

NURSE FRANKLIN
Guy psycho or whacked out on dope

ISAAC
I’ll hedge my bets Both

He finds what he’s looking for Maalox As he swigs
NURSE FRANKLIN
Weve stashed some Chardonnay in the
fridge behind the urine samples and
tetanus toxoid
Isaac doesn’t pick up on the offer Franklin tries again

NURSE FRANKLIN
Robert’s out of town till Wednesday

A beat then Isaac snaps shut Crazy Man’s chart

TSAAC
Really Maybe tomorrow night But I
don’t know - I’ve got this thing

Franklin nods this thing Great And Isaac hurries out
cUT TO
EXT ISAAC’S BUILDING - LATE NIGHT

A brownstone on 19th off Broadway Isaac has the lower two
floors and the basement office

He steps out of a cab in front of a huge hairy HOMELESS MAN
warming himself by a garbage can -- its contents are afire

HOMELESS MAN
Hey Doc Would you consider loaning me
five-thousand dollars

Isaac hands him a pile of change then hurries to his door
INT ISAAC’S LIVING ROOM LATE NIGHT

Isaac turns on a light on a dimmer very low Our first
impression is of books everywhere And second of the sorts
of fixtures and furnishings a bachelor would have
unaccountably mixed with older worn items from another era

A dark older WOMAN steps into the room She’s been knitting
a sweater They speak softly

WOMAN
Everything’s fine She’s fast asleep

ISAAC
Thanks Maria Let me call you a cab

WOMAN (MARIA)
Ill do it

She goes to the phone Isaac crosses into
INT BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

A LADY not that old but frail her body slightly bowed is
tucked in bed Her features are relaxed blank but there
is an intelligence somehow in her eyes Her eyes are open

Isaac sits on the couch opposite the bed Quietly

TSAAC
Got beeped at the game Missed the end
Just gets worse at the hospital
The city’s at war A war in the head
in people’s heads and we’re losing

Isaac’s mother doesn’t respond It doesn’t seem as though
she can hear him Nevertheless he continues to converse

ISAAC
I’1l be home all morning

He nods down at the floor signifying the floor below

ISAAC
Private patients I know I know but
it just piles up
(remembers)
»» then court tomorrow afternoon

We HEAR the night nurse letting herself out Isaac stands
crosses to his mother’s bedside Strokes her forehead
ISAAC
Okay okay I promise I’11 slow down

cuT TO
INT ISAAC’S OFFICE EARLY AFTERNOON

Quiet and austere Black blinds block the view The desk is
made of two filing cabinets and a marble top There’s an
Eames chair opposite the desk chair and a black leather couch
opposite the Eames chair Isaac sits in the Eames chair

OFF-SCREEN we hear the VOICE of a young WOMAN

WOMAN (OS)
I’ve had the dream again

Lying on the couch is DIANA BAYLOR mid-20’s Very pretty
but pale and thin In drab clothes and schoolgirl bangs

Clearly much of the session has already passed her eyes are
closed her body limp

DIANA
I’m arranging flowers on a table as
a centerpiece

Isaac watches as she twists on the couch causing her skirt
to hike up ever higher on her thighs

DIANA
I decorate the flowerpot with fancy
paper

Suddenly her eyelids roll wide open like a doll’s

DIANA
By the way my sister --

ISAAC
Wait Let’s go back to your dream
Tell me more about the flowers

DIANA
There’s nothing more to tell

She swings her feet over the side of the couch and sits up
DIANA
My sister still wants to talk to you
She thinks she knows some things about
Mom and Dad that might shed some light

Isaac glances at his clock As he suspected end of session
ISAAC
Maybe these are things we’d do better
to uncover in our work here Diana

DIANA
She’s paying for this Dr Barr

TSAAC
Why don’t we discuss how that makes you
feel in our next session

Diana hesitates then stands As she starts toward the door

ISAAC
And try to be on time please

Diana turns Explains

DIANA
It’s not me it’s the stove

Isaac looks at her

DIANA
Whenever I leave my apartment I have
to go back to be sure the stove’s off
Then after I check it I have to go
back to be sure the pilot light didn’t
blow out when I closed the oven door

ISAAC
That’s why you were late today

DIANA
I went back thirteen times

She stands there awaiting a response from Isaac Finally
ISAAC
It could be that you perform this
ritual in order to be late
Diana looks confused
ISAAC
To put people off Make them give up
on you As a way of avoiding intimacy

DIANA
You mean I’m passive aggressive

Isaac stands Calmly firmly as he shows her to the door

ISAAC
We’ll get into it on Thursday

He gently closes the door on her Then bolts to his desk --
he’s late --

Isaac madly grabs at a bunch of papers and thrusts them into
his briefcase

cur TO
INT GYPSY CAB AFTERNOON

Speeding up to 161st Street Past halfdemolished housing
developments and bombed-out storefronts Beirut the Bronx

Isaac alternately reviews his papers and stares out at the
devastation His knee jiggles As they stop at a red light

ISAAC
(whispers)
Don’t be mean turn to green

A chant he’s used since he was young The light stays red

TSAAC
Don’t be mean turn to gr--

The CABBLE jumps the red light and goes SCREECHING through an

intersection just missing two others cars

ISAAC
Take it easy

CABBIE
You said you were inna hurry

ISAAC
I was kidding

cuT To
INT BRONX SUPREME COURT - AFTERNOON

In the back Legal Aid Lawyers try to convince various pimps
prostitutes dope dealers motorcycle punks to cop pleas

Isaac on the witness stand is being cross-examined

ASSISTANT DA
This is a schizophrenic patient who may
suffer a relapse in the future Isn’t
that true

ISAAC
I don’t agree that Pepe Carrero suffers
from a schizophrenic illness

ISAAC (Cont’d)
Nonetheless the prognostic indicators
of what you call a relapse are
Previous hospitalization Pepe was not
previously hospitalized Gradual onset
of the illness His onset was abrupt
acute Lingering symptoms Pepe has
had a rapid reorganization

Pepe small and scared sits at the defense table in borrowed
clothes that are too big for him beside his lawyer O’Brien

MS KAUFMAN
You don’t feel that this man who
murdered his male lover with scissors
should be held in a secure facility
For our safety if not for his own

O’BRIEN
Objection Your Honor our safety
isn’t the issue here --

ISAAC
Id like to answer the question
JUDGE
Go ahead
ISAAC
A maximum security state hospital --
what you call a secure facility -- is

in fact a human warehouse There’s no
psychotherapy offered only chemical
restraints And once a patient is
committed who knows how long he’1l1 be
held there Five years Ten Will he
be a human time bomb when he’s
released No Pepe will be safer ina
civil psychiatric treatment center

And if he’s safe we’ll be safe too

cuT TO
INT COURTHOUSE ROTUNDA - LATE AFTERNOON

Crowded with the accused their lawyers and relatives Isaac
and O’Brien make their way through the mob to the street

OBRIEN
Score another upset win We’rea
fucking demonic team you and me

ISAAC
True

O’BRIEN

So why are you so fucking ecstatic
ISAAC

I dunno Suppose Pepe slips through

the system It’s been known to happen
OBRIEN

Pokes another boyfriend with pinking

shears

Suddenly Isaac notices across the entrance hall a stunning
WOMAN who seems to be peering through the crowd at him
She’s fair early 30’s and couldn’t look more out of place

QO’ BRIEN
Hey that’s Pepe’s problem We won
Ike my man Now we gonna celebrate

Now the Woman is obscured by an oversized pair of Bikers

ISAAC
I’m gonna go home Eat with my mother

O’BRIEN
Hey Gretschen could feed her tonight

Isaac nods at his beeper

ISAAC
I’m on call

O’Brien grabs Isaac’s beeper off his belt Waves it

O’BRIEN
Y’know who wears beepers these days
Crack dealers

ISAAC
(grabs it back)
And doctors

He clips it on his belt again Then looks up trying to find
the stunning Woman But she’s vanished now

OBRIEN
(scolds)
Only people you hang out with are guys
that rape their grandmothers

ISAAC
After decapitating them
ll

They exit the courthouse and Isaac flags a gypsy cab
curT TO
INT ISAAC’S VESTIBULE EVENING (LATER)

Isaac unlocks his mailbox Removes his mail and scans it
He seems to be looking for one particular letter

He finds what he’s looking for rips open the envelope

ISAAC
Yes

Then pulls out his many keys and starts to unlock the front
door when he hears behind him

WOMAN (0S)
-- Dr Barr

Isaac turns to find the Woman from the courthouse Her
rather sensational figure he now sees is wrapped in a
tight-fitting Romeo Gigli suit that seems made for her

WOMAN
I’m Heather Evans -- Diana Baylor’s
sister I left a few messages on your

machine

ISAAC
I’ve been in court Didn’t I -- see
you there

HEATHER

I wanted to speak with you alone And
the man you were with I thought maybe
- I don’t know that he might’ve been
some kind of patient or something

ISAAC
(laughs)
O’Brien He’s crazy but nobody’s had
him committed yet

Her limpid eyes fixed on Isaac Heather waits for him to say
more

ISAAC
Well come in for a second

INT ISAAC’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

As they enter Heather takes in the several walls of books

HEATHER
Youve read them all
ISAAC
Oh those My decorator buys them by

the pound

He uncertainly glances at Heather who’s taken Modern Man In
Search Of A Soul off the shelf

ISAAC
Would you excuse me a minute

INT BACK BEDROOM - NIGHT

Isaac’s mother is propped up in bed GRETSCHEN the tough
looking but attractive day nurse is spoon-feeding her

ISAAC
Gretsch Could you stay another hour

She looks up at him Smiles

GRETSCHEN
I could stay all night
ISAAC
Oh Okay Yeah Good

He takes the spoon from her hand starts to feed his mother

ISAAC
Mom my paper It’s been accepted
for presentation at the next Academy of
Psychiatry and Law Conference

TIsaac’s mother silently finishes her soup

ISAAC
I know it’s not that big a deal But
everything helps when you’re not board

certified
He hands the spoon back to Gretschen Tells his mother
ISAAC
I’ve got somebody waiting A patient’s
sister 211 talk to you later
INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Heather slides the Jung volume back onto the shelf

HEATHER
Who were you talking to

ISAAC
(a little embarrassed)
My mother
Heather laughs
HEATHER
Are you into taxidermy too
Isaac looks quizzical - he doesn’t get it
HEATHER

Norman Bates -
Now Isaac laughs

ISAAC
No my mother’s quite real Though I
guess Norman would’ve said the same

Now Heather notices Gretschen standing in the doorframe of
the back bedroom Appraising her

HEATHER
Could we possibly go somewhere else
To talk

curT TO
INT LOCAL COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

Isaac and Heather are in a booth sipping coffee In bg a
trio of garish transvestite Hookers buys cigarettes candy

ISAAC
Diana mentioned to me that you know
something about your parents

HEATHER
Does anybody really know anything about
their parents Actually I’11l bet your
parents are terribly proud of their son
the doctor

ISAAC
Actually my father’s dead and -

HEATHER
I’m sorry How

ISAAC
Car accident And my mother’s had a
stroke so there’s no way of knowing if
she’s proud actually
He offers a slightly pained smile

HEATHER
Were you driving the car
ISAAC
As a matter of fact
HEATHER
So you decided to become a doctor
TSAAC
Obviously
HEATHER
Can psychiatrists really cure people
TSAAC
(shrugs)
Freud called it the impossible
profession
HEATHER
(beat then)
I guess Jimmy agrees with Freud
ISAAC
(beat then)
Jimmy is your husband

Heather offers a pained smile of her own
HEATHER
He thinks people in analysis just need
a good spanking

ISAAC
Some of them could benefit from that

Heather stubs out her cigarette

HEATHER
I could use some air
cuUT TO
EXT STREET NIGHT
The street is quite empty - a sense that the rest of the

city is barricaded behind heavy doors and barred windows

ISAAC
So you hate your husband

HEATHER
Hate That’s a strong word
ISAAC
Why do you stay with him
HEATHER
Maybe it’s a matter of chemistry
pheromones Isnt that the word
ISAAC

Pheromones have only been demonstrated
to work in animal mating Humans are a

lot more complicated

HEATHER
I’m not so sure
(then)
How are you planning to help Diana

ISAAC
To paraphrase Freud I’m trying to
her neurotic misery into general
unhappiness

HEATHER
Are you generally unhappy

ISAAC
Actually you caught me at a bad tim
I’m feeling pretty good

HEATHER
I don’t think I believe you
ISAAC
(laughing protests)
But my days are full rich I’m
first-name basis with several mass
murderers
HEATHER

(laughs then)
May I call you Isaac

ISAAC
Please

HEATHER
We really need your help

As she flags a cab It screeches to a stop
in Isaac leans into the window

turn

(ee

on a

Heather climbs

ISAAC
nWel

HEATHER
(amends)
Diana
(then)
Goodnight Isaac I’m glad we met

As her cab takes off Isaac pulls out a cigarette and sticks
it in his mouth

And forgets to light it as he stands here and stares at the
disappearing cab

cut TO
INT HEATHER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT LATER

Memphis intermixed with Victorian antiques A Francis Bacon
on one wall

HEATHER
- Jimmy --

INT BATHROOM

which is the size of a normal bedroom - mirrored walls two
sinks and wc’s shower tub and five-foot diameter sunken
Jacuzzi in the middle always filled with hot bubbling water

An alcove houses an exercise area with Lifecycle dumbbells
treadmill etc

Luxuriating in the Jacuzzi is JIMMY EVANS swarthy with
thick taunting features For a man of 40 he’s in fine
shape -- and with all this equipment why not

He lazily eyes Heather In a sleepy deep insinuating tone

JIMMY
Heather Honey Man I’ve missed you

HEATHER
I tried you Jimmy I let the phone
ring forever

There is none of the teasing insouciance heard with Isaac
JIMMY
I been soaking awhile all evening
actually and I’m still unwinding

HEATHER
Can I bring you a scotch Something
JIMMY
I gotta haul my ass out of this tub
We’re meeting Nick Pappas at Nell’s

Heather nods Jimmy nods at Heather nodding Then --

She places

She’s whini

Heather hop
coat Toss

CLOSE JIMMY

His eyes fe

JIMMY
You knew that right That we had a
social obligation

HEATHER
Well I mean I’ve been running all
day and --

JIMMY

Where from Eve Arden to Bendel’s to
where

HEATHER
Elizabeth Arden And I’m tired
JIMMY
You’re tired
HEATHER

You heard me

her hands on her hips challenging him

JIMMY

I heard you Now do it
HEATHER

Not now Please Jimmy --
OITMMY

Do it Heather
HEATHER

I told you I’m tired
ng a bit like a child

JIMMY
Do it

elessly stares at him Then strips off
es it Undoes her blouse

ast on her A buzzard’s eyes

JIMMY
Slower

He grins

her suit-

His voice is slightly choked with lust

JIMMY
Don’t ever tell anybody what we do

And then he suddenly stands in the Jacuzzi the water
whooshing off him - this great dark hairy figure emerging
like a sea monster from the depths He steps out of the tub
HIGH ANGLE HEATHER

lies naked on the white marble floor Fetally curled

LOW ANGLE - JIMMY

Looming Omnipotent He stares down at his wife When he
speaks he sounds truly moved

JIMMY
You are magnificent

cuT TO
INT ISAACS OFFICE AFTERNOON

Diana has just arrived Wearing a cute pinafore white
anklets maryjanes As she sits on the couch

DIANA
Isnt she beautiful Dr Barr
ISAAC
Who
DIANA
Heather She told me You met her
ISAAC
Yes
DIANA

Compared to her I always felt like a
caterpillar y’know Creepy and
crawly

ISAAC
Perhaps it’s unproductive to compare
yourself with Heather

DIANA
(trace of bile)
because I can’t measure up

Diana catches herself her voice softens

DIANA
You guys talked about Mom and Dad

ISAAC
Actually we didn’t And I want you to
know that we didn’t discuss what
happens in this room If we meet
again I’ll only be a listener And
I’ll let you know what she tells me

Diana lies back
DIANA
I had the dream again
(beat)
I’m arranging a centerpiece of flowers
on a table
She speaks rotely as though reciting someone else’s words
DIANA
I decorate the flowerpot with fancy
paper
Silence When he’s sure she’s not going to say more

ISAAC
What kind of flowers

DIANA
Three kinds Lilies carnations

She trails off again

ISAAC

And the third kind

Diana shrugs she can’t remember
ISAAC

What are your associations with the
word lily

DIANA
Like lily-white I guess Pure

ISAAC
What about carnation

Diana draws a blank

TSAAC
Do you know the word carnal

DIANA
(beat then)
It has to do with -- lust right
Isaac nods
ISAAC

So far in your centerpiece you’ve
placed a symbol of purity - of
virginity - and a symbol of lust

Diana turns to Isaac with a coy embarrassed smile

DIANA
I guess there’s a conflict here

ISAAC
Do you remember what we said about the
stove ritual

DIANA
You mean somehow that it’s this passive
aggressive thing

ISAAC
I think that fear of intimacy may be
an issue here

As though to gain the upper hand

DIANA
The stove ritual is over Dr Barr I
haven’t done it in a week

ISAAC
Why do you think that is

As she considers her body twitches on the couch hiking up
her pinafore revealing a great deal of leg

DIANA
I don’t know
(then)
I’m checking the gun now

ISAAC
(tensing)
- the gun
DIANA
I make sure the safety’s on and that
it’s loaded five to ten times in

the morning
2l

ISAAC
Why do you feel you need a gun

DIANA
I don’t feel I do Heather made me
take it It belongs to um --

TSAAC
Jimmy

The name has popped out of his mouth both Isaac and Diana
look surprised Quickly recovering

ISAAC
Why don’t we focus on the feelings and
associations you get when you’re
checking the gun in the morning

DIANA
Well it’s my surrogate penis and the
safety being on is because I’m
ambivalent about my phallic fantasies
and the bullets are semen

Isaac takes a beat
ISAAC
Have you thought about the dangers of
keeping a loaded gun in your apartment

Diana thinks about it So does Isaac He doesn’t look happy
at all

TIME CUT

Were still in Isaac’s office but it’s evening Heather is
sitting on the couch now As she swings up her legs

HEATHER
So is this where Diana lies

ISAAC
And sometimes tells the truth

HEATHER
When she’s deep in thought does she
sort of twitch and turn

Which Heather does for Isaac’s amusement

HEATHER
making her skirt sort of accidently
ride up like this

Heather somehow makes her skirt hitch up to mid-thigh

Isaac watches as impassively as he can manage When Heather
finally turns to him for a reaction

ISAAC
Tell me about the gun

HEATHER
What gun

ISAAC

Jimmy’s gun The gun you gave Diana
Heather swings her legs over sits up again

HEATHER
Isaac I worry about my baby sister
but I have not armed her In case
youve missed it Diana invents
neurotic compulsions She thinks they
make her interesting I assume she
told you she checks her stove fifty
times every morning

ISAAC
(nods)
But a fabrication is a kind of fantasy
and a fantasy is a kind of wish Do
you see what I’m getting at

HEATHER
Behind every lie there’s an element of
truth
Isaac nods again
ISAAC

Still I’m glad the gun is a lie
Heather looks disappointed

HEATHER
- And that’s it

ISAAC
Unless you want to tell me whatever you
came to tell me the other night

Heather rises Paces like a cat
HEATHER

Your downstairs office this brownstone
It’s all very Dressed To Kill

Isaac smiles but he doesn’t respond
HEATHER
Are you dangerous Dr Barr

TSAAC
What do you think

Suddenly she stops pacing and turns to him
HEATHER

I think a psychiatrist can’t have a
personal relationship with a patient

ISAAC
You’re right
HEATHER
What about a patient’s sister
ISAAC
Technically there’s nothing that
prohibits it But to me it
doesn’t feel right
HEATHER
Okay
ISAAC

In addition to which you’re married

HEATHER
Technically

Heather sinks back down onto the couch Sighs

HEATHER
You try divorcing a Greek Orthodox
gangster

Isaac smiles at her melodramatic choice of words

ISAAC
A gangster What he drives a Stutz
Bearcat and wears double-breasted
pinstriped suits

HEATHER
He drives a Mercedes 300 and wears
single-breasted pinstriped suits
Jimmy builds public housing for the

poor which is what gangsters do today
We live together in the same apartment

Emphasis on apart

ISAAC
Look our previous evening together
already generated some inappropriate
stuff in my session with Diana

HEATHER
That sounds like psychobabble - but if
it’s how you feel let’s not beat this

to death
She sits up A last look at Isaac Then she stands

HEATHER
Goodnight Goodbye

ISAAC
Okay I’m sorry Goodbye

He moves to the door to let her out -- they brush up against
each other in the door frame

Then they’re kissing Running their hands over one another’s
bodies Hungrily they’ve both been starving In between
moans of pleasure and anticipation

ISAAC
There’s a nurse upstairs And my
mother

HEATHER

(softly)
Well be quiet I won’t tell

They’ve fallen back onto the stairs that lead up to Isaac’s
apartment Feverishly undressing each other here

And then abruptly Heather disentangles herself from Isaac

ISAAC
- What -

She holds up a palm wait

Then begins a slow languid melancholy strip that instantly
hypnotizes him

HEATHER
(softly)
Do you like this

ISAAC
(hoarse)
Yes

CUT TO
25

INT PRISON WARD - MORNING

Isaac and Alan Lowenthal -- the reserved psychiatrist we saw
earlier at the stadium - have just entered the checkpoint
ISAAC

On the gate

It’s a sort of cage surrounded by mirrors and closed-circuit
cameras Isaac nods at all the bars and security devices and
chirps at his gloomy colleague

ISAAC
Look at this Shrinks in cages But
we can free ourselves Alan Learn

to hang-glide maybe Mentally too
Alan doesn’t know what to make of Isaac’s lightheadedness

ALAN
Cut it out You’re making me nervous

The Gatekeeper BUZZES them in
curT TO
INT DAYROOM - MORNING LATER

Where some PATIENTS play cards others aimlessly roam around
the crowded room Those most heavily medicated are slumped
before the TV watching Wheel of Fortune Isaac making his
rounds is peppered with OS questions eg When’s my court
date Doc and Hey Doc when do I get sprung outta here

Isaac is approached by INMATE 1

INMATE 1
Doc -- I’m charged with assault
Compared to the motherfucking fights I
seen in here what I had was a tiff
And I’m charged with assault

ISAAC
Billy Regardless of what other people
call it or what other people do you
still have to work on controlling your
anger Okay

Inmate 1 looks a tad defensive
TSAAC

Anyway lst Degree Tiff doesn’t have
the right ring to it does it

Inmate 1 backs off Isaac approaches an almost sweetlooking
INMATE 2 hunched in the corner

ISAAC
What’s up Kevin

INMATE 2
Doc I figured out why I smoked all
that angel dust and crack It’s not
‘cause I feel bad about myself It’s
‘cause I feel bad about the world
Isaac is surprised and touched by this

ISAAC
Yeah I think I know that feeling

Inmate 2 is surprised but comforted by Isaac’s response

INMATE 2
You do

Now insistently tapping Isaac’s shoulder is Bantar Man
BANTAR MAN
Doc I made you something in art
therapy class

He furtively pulls several sheets of sketchbook paper out
from under his shirt and hands them to Isaac

CLOSE - ARTWORK

Crude paintings of the devil the names Isaac and
Satan connected with arrows repetitions of the phrase
Dr Barr must die

BACK TO SCENE

Isaac puts on a broad smile

TSAAC
May I keep these
BANTAR MAN
They’re yours Doc Suitable for

framing

Now Isaac notices Pepe Carrero across the dayroom longingly
staring out through the mesh window Isaac crosses

ISAAC
Hey Pepe

Pepe turns Sees Isaac smiles

PEPE
Hey Doc
ISAAC
Pepe You been hearing any voices
PEPE
Nada
ISAAC

You know you’re being transferred as an
outpatient to Bronx Psychiatric it’s a
civil hospital

PEPE
Thanks to you Dr Barr You ever need
anything from me you just ask

ISAAC
Thanks
(then)
Look I just want to know After your
boyfriend brutalized you the thing

that happened with the scissors

Pepe steps back immediately uncomfortable Isaac holds his
gaze peers hard into his eyes

ISAAC
Is there some part of you - way deep
inside you -- that feels maybe it was
right though you know it was wrong
Pepe pales
PEPE
Oh man No I was crazy And
for weeks after all’s I could hear was
Ramon screaming No way man Shit --

With Isaac and Nurse Franklin
ISAAC
Let’s keep an eye on Larry Pomeranze --
he’s sure we’ve got a machine upstairs
that’s scrambling his brain
(looks up at her)
Do we

FRANKLIN
I’ve never known Larry to be wrong on
something like this

ISAAC
Disassemble it immediately And also
-- and I hate to do this - raise his

Thorazine to 1200 a day Oh and I
think we can DC Lamarr King from one
to-one suicide watch

Am I forgetting anything

Absently as he exits the nursing station

INT ADMINISTRATIVE WING AFTERNOON

ALAN
This new referral is so dull
Yesterday during the session I
actually started to fall asleep

ISAAC
Long as you don’t snore

ALAN
But what do you say at the end of a
droning monologue you haven’t heard

Isaac and Alan munch hero sandwiches as they move along the
corridor crowded with crying kids shouting patients cops
drifting here and there

TSAAC
You repeat the last word or two
phrased as a question
(demonstrates)
Your mother

Alan laughs

ISAAC
I’ve got a great new patient who uses
the most elegant symbolism and verbal
bridges in her dream content She
represents her libido not by a tunnel
or a forest but by a carnation

ALAN
Ah Carnation Carnal I like it

ISAAC
She has an older sister About thirty
We met a couple of times to talk about
the family

Alan follows him into
INT ISAAC’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

cramped crowded with files made (barely) habitable only by
the window that faces onto a rooftop exercise area

Alan shuts the door tight Sits opposite Isaac

ALAN
You didn’t sleep with her

ISAAC
Look if you never want to have lunch
with me again I understand

ALAN
No don’t stop I’d love to see you
hanged by your civil libertarian pals

ISAAC
Hey I went through the AMA‘s
Principles of Ethics and even the
special annotations for psychiatry
don’t say anything about sleeping with
a patient’s sister

Alan shakes his head incredulous
ISAAC

What can I say Alan I have a
weakness for unhappy women

ALAN
Don’t flatter yourself All shrinks
have a weakness for unhappy women

ISAAC
Yes but this is something special
She’s really unhappy

Alan is unamused

ALAN
If your patient finds out -- which
seems likely then all the trust

you’ve built goes down the dumper If
she doesn’t find out it’s because
youre lying to her which means the
analysis can’t continue Anyway you
know as well as I do that romantic love
is a projection You don’t see this
woman you see your vision of her
You’re in a delusional state Isaac
No human being is so beautiful so
special that she uh that she -

Alan is looking past Isaac His mouth is slightly agape
HEATHER

has stepped into the office She’s like a goddess visiting
the lower depths

ALAN
C-can I help you

Heather touches Isaac’s shoulder Alan dies a little

HEATHER
The receptionist said you’d be here

Isaac is surprised and delighted He stands

ISAAC
This is Alan Lowenthal My colleague
my conscience Alan Heather Evans

A blushing Alan jumps to his feet as well

ALAN

Pleased to meet you
(offers his seat)

Please Sit down

HEATHER
Sorry for barging in on you guys
ALAN
Don’t be

ISAAC
(to Alan)
What were we just saying

Alan flashes Isaac a mortified grin

ALAN
That I’m late for rounds Nice to meet
you Ms Evans

HEATHER
Nice meeting you

Alan mops his brow and hurriedly EXITS
Heather smiles at Isaac

HEATHER

HEATHER

Jimmy made a reservation at Lutece

ISAAC
There’re worse places to eat dinner

HEATHER
That’s just the beginning Then it’s
on to Nell’s Three times a week

He makes me dance

She looks down as though in shame Isaac reaches a hand to
her chin turns her face up to his

His mouth finds hers She bites his lip He pushes her
against the wall hand groping under her skirt She grabs
and tears at him They are almost making love when

INT PRISON WARD FIVE MINUTES LATER

Bantar Man is being restrained by Four C0O’s as a fifth fits
him for a straitjacket Another CO kneels nearby with a
smashed bloody nose

Alan has just injected Bantar Man with a heavy sedative as

He guiltily takes in the scene

OBRIEN

Who is this guy

ISAAC
I don’t know ‘s’why I’m asking you
(then concedes)
Somebody’s husband

O’Brien squints at his friend

ISAAC
She’s trying to get out of it And I’m
trying to find out if that’s as tough
as she’s making it sound

O’BRIEN

ISAAC

Yeah I know But trust me Mike

INT LUTECE - NIGHT
Jimmy and Heather looking splendid but stiff share a table
in one of the formal uhpolstered dining rooms upstairs He’s
washing down sauteed sweetbreads with a wine that he
refreshes from a carafe She’s picking at pelerines a la
Meridionale and sipping ice water
A CLATTERING of silverware in lieu of conversation Finally

JIMMY
Know what I love about Lutece

Heather reluctantly raises her eyebrows what

JIMMY
You take away the prices and all the
polite bullshit and it’s peasant food
Mountain food My kind of food

Heather manages a halfhearted murmur

JIMMY
Plus which we’re not gonna run into any
of my ah grease-a-ball business-a

buddies y’know what I’m saying
Another murmur from across the table

JIMMY

They’re in pig heaven in their pasta
palaces with the velvet walls and the
wine steward fresh off the boat What
do those gorillas know from Alsation
cuisine

(beat)
Where is Alsatia anyway

HEATHER
(quietly corrects)
Alsace

JIMMY
Al’s ass Who’s Al Some stud you’re
seeing on the side

Mortified Heather glances at the neighboring Diners

JIMMY
What do you care if they heard Do you
think their shit don’t stink

HEATHER
You can be very crude

JIMMY
And you need that Crude Rough
You pretend that you don’t but you do

Heather looks down She is mum
JIMMY
To get off
(cold quiet)
Don’t you
Heather looks up

HEATHER
I’d like some wine with dinner
JIMMY
Youd like some wine with dinner

He lifts his glass as though to hand it to her But he
holds it tantalizingly out of reach

JIMMY
Or don’t you remember the last time
You got way out of hand

HEATHER
“Way out of hand
JIMMY
Wild
HEATHER
I got wild I have one good time
once and I’m wild
JIMMY

It’s more than once

HEATHER
Oh youre right Twice Thrice
(snaps her fingers)
- Hopa

JIMMY
Two months I’m holding this reservation
and you pick tonight to grow a wild
hair up your ass

Again Heather flicks her eyes to the nearby tables
JIMMY
They’re not gonna help you You need
help you pray You pray to me

HEATHER
One sip

There is a note of pleading in her voice

JIMMY
You pray Our father

HEATHER
(weakly)
Our father
Jimmy smiles Then hands her his wine glass

JIMMY
One sip

Heather takes a gulp Then passes the glass back to him
Jimmy is happy now As he polishes off his sweetbreads

JIMMY
You believe I’m eating this Me who
used to be a vegetarian And here I am
chewing on a pancreas A pancreas is a
gland f’r godsakes

During this speech Heather has gone from listlessly forking
her scallops to furiously attacking them

JIMMY
(alarmed)
Heather -

Seemingly oblivious Heather stabs at her scallops with such
force the sauce splatters off the plate

Several Diners in the immediate vicinity trade concerned
looks with Jimmy who’s now leaning across the table

JIMMY
Heather

Apparently brought back to her senses Heather abruptly sets
down her silverware Then softly

HEATHER
It’s alright I’m a little woozy
I need the ladies room

She shakily stands awkwardly pushes her chair aside

HEATHER
I‘1ll be fine

She puts on a wan smile meant to reassure Shuffles away
from the table Jimmy tears off a chunk of roll As he
starts to butter it we hear a startling SHRIEK OFF-SCREEN

HEATHER’S VOICE
He’s controlling me My brain

Horrified Jimmy drops his butter knife Turns Gawks
WHAT HE SEES

At the staircase just beyond the dining room stands Heather
Wild-eyed mouth twisted finger pointed at Jimmy Her

screeches sound not at all like her natural voice it’s as
though Heather were demonically possessed

HEATHER
My brain My body They’re not mine

The hush is palpable All eating and bustling have ceased
Diners and Waiters alike are frozen by the spectacle

Then Heather bolts back to the table She hurls herself ata
horrified Jimmy who ducks out of harm’s way Heather
crashes onto the table which collapses onto the floor

She is rushed by three waiters and two captains As they
seize Heather sprawled across the capsized table her cries
continue muffled

HEATHER
He controls my brain My body --

CLOSE SYRINGE
As Heather is injected we hear

JIMMYS VOICE
She had a drink a few times before and
kinda snapped But I never thought
one big sip could set her off

INT EXAMINATION ROOM - NIGHT - LATER

Heather sweaty and bruised is laid out on an examining
table Jimmy anxiously watches as the attending NURSE
completes the injection swabs Heather’s shoulder then combs
the damp hair out of her face

NURSE
Shes been in before

JIMMY
Why We only get one visit

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - JIMMY
is met here by the Attending PHYSICIAN As they shake

PHYSICIAN
Mr Evans I’m Dr Spector

They start down the corridor crowded with Patients standing
sitting sprawled on gurneys etc

DR SPECTOR
You realize your wife suffers from
Pathological Intoxication

DR SPECTOR (Cont’d)
I see on her chart she came in here
last year after a similar incident

JIMMY
If I knew so little could make her go
flippy In Lutece talk about

humiliating --

DR SPECTOR
People with this syndrome will have a
dramatic often violent response to
even the most minute amounts of
alcohol And never remember a thing

EXT HOSPITAL LATE NIGHT

Two orderlies deposit the semiconscious Heather into the back
seat of a waiting cab

DR SPECTOR
(tells Jimmy)
We gave her five milligrams of Haldol
Get her home let her sleep off the
shot and keep her away from alcohol
In any form Understood

INT CAB (MOVING) NIGHT

Heather is half-sprawled head lolling Jimmy studies her
face -- relaxed even beautiful despite the bruise

JIMMY
(soft mournful)
You’re damaged goods

He reaches out and gently arranges her hair just so as one
would do for a small child

JIMMY
But you’re also my wife

He suddenly seizes Heather and desperately clutches her limp
form to hin

JIMMY
But if you ever embarrass me like that
again I’1ll fucking kill you

He’s at his word processor revising his paper In bg we
faintly HEAR canned LAUGHS from a TV in his mother’s bedroom

defense has been under fire from

BACK TO SCENE
Disgusted he stops typing Mutters as he deletes

ISAAC
Bullshit

Reaches into the ashtray finds the longest cigarette butt
As he starts to light it there is a loud BUZZ

Isaac jumps up crosses to the intercom

INT ISAAC’S KITCHEN FIVE MINUTES LATER
As he mixes two vodka tonics he hears from the living room

HEATHER’S VOICE
Is your mother awake

ISAAC
Watching the tube

He crosses with the drinks into
INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Heather is peering at Isaac’s computer screen
ISAAC
Don’t read that Would you like to

meet her

HEATHER
Not yet

She looks up as Isaac hands her a glass Lightly sniffs

HEATHER
Vodka

ISAAC
And tonic

HEATHER

I‘d prefer hot water with lemon I’m
fighting a cold And I don’t drink

ISAAC
But you smoke

HEATHER
Want one Go in my pocketbook

She tilts her head in the direction of the couch where she’d
left it Then crosses to the kitchen to turn on the kettle

Isaac reaches into Heather’s pocketbook And finds an item
that’s more intriguing than cigarettes He pulls out

A LEAD PIPE

Chrome-plated about five inches long with threaded ends
SCENE

Isaac is studying it as Heather steps back into the room

HEATHER
Oh That’s protection There’s a lot
of lunatics in this town

ISAAC
Fortunately for some of us

He hefts the pipe

ISAAC
Hmm Why not a whistle Or mace Or
a nice traditional kick in the balls

Meantime Heather is reading off Isaac’s computer screen

HEATHER
The insanity defense is as old as the
conflict between free will and
determinism As far back as the Bible
distinctions are drawn between those
who are criminally responsible and
those who are not

ISAAC
Painful isn’t it I’ve got to rework
the whole thing

HEATHER
Why It looks interesting

ISAAC
The words of a sage who acquired his
hard-won wisdom in the law library
Heather turns from the screen to him
HEATHER
Whereas now that you’re sleeping with a
patient’s married sister you’ve become
worldly and profound
Isaac is about to retort when he notices

ISAAC
Your cheek What happened --

Heather averts her face to make the bruise less obvious

HEATHER
Nothing
ISAAC
Jimmy
HEATHER
I thought you wanted a cigarette Go
on - have a cigarette

Still clutching the lead pipe Isaac holds it in her face

ISAAC
This is protection from Jimmy isn’t
it Talk to me

Heather steps toward him Reaches out for him
HEATHER
I can stay late He has a poker game
Tuesdays and Thursdays Sometimes he
plays all night
Incongruous mindless LAUGHTER cascades from the back bedroon

ISAAC
He leaves you all night to play poker

As he puts the pipe back in her pocketbook

TSAAC
Every new detail helps me to hate him
more And I don’t even know the guy

HEATHER
Let’s leave it that way

In the kitchen the kettle emits a SHRIEK that quickly becomes
piercing But neither Isaac nor Heather appears to notice

ISAAC
I don’t want to leave it And I don’t
think you do either

Heather’s response is to abruptly almost violently -- kiss
Tsaac’s lips As abruptly she breaks the kiss

HEATHER
Isaac don’t rewrite your paper Don’t
change because of me This isn’t real

ISAAC
No What’s real A husband who drops
a bundle at five-card stud then
stumbles home and smacks his wife

Isaac shakes his head

ISAAC
That’s bullshit This is real
Heather shakes her head - more adamant even than Isaac
HEATHER

No This isn’t real It’s a movie
Were in a movie

Her tone is almost desperate Isaac starts to speak but

HEATHER
Here’s a scene I’m in bed -

INT ISAAC’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A modest room upstairs Crowded also with books and papers
Heather lies on Isaac’s bed nearly naked partially covered
by a sheet He stands in the far corner shrouded in shadow

HEATHER
In my bed Asleep But warm it’s
summer I toss and turn

ISAAC
(soft rapt)
And who am I

HEATHER
You’re an intruder You’ve come for my
jewels You thought I was out of town
with my husband But I stayed behind

Isaac moves toward the bed We see now that he is naked

HEATHER
You’ve just come out of jail Haven’t
been with a woman in five years But
you were a legendary lover You’d

Isaac silences her with a soft kiss Then deftly removes her
lingerie with one hand while tenderly stroking her with the
other His movements are gentle deliberate Healing

Then Heather pulls her mouth apart from his to speak Her
voice is oddly childlike

HEATHER
Can you fuck me without hurting me

Isaac is stunned by the question But now is not the time to
play shrink

ISAAC
Of course

He continues to make love to her She begins to respond At
first she is tentative but it builds steadily and builds
more When she comes it is both ecstatic and a strange
surprise A tear slides down her cheek

ISAAC
What

Heather pulls herself together Kisses Isaac’s forehead

HEATHER

That never happened to me before
ISAAC

You mean you don’t come when -
HEATHER

Don’t be silly
ISAAC

Then why

A beat then Heather swings her legs off the bed

HEATHER
I have to go

Her tone is suddenly oddly cordial She finds her bra her
panties Stands before the mirror and brushes her hair with
quick strokes

ISAAC

Stay awhile longer I want to talk
HEATHER

Io can’t You know I can’t

She continues to brush her hair - in an abstract way like
an autistic activity Now without turning from the mirror
HEATHER

How is Diana Will she be okay
TSAAC
Well see progress But there’s no

magic It takes a lot of time and hard
work to break through the defenses

HEATHER
(matter of fact)
Our Mom died when we were small -- Dad
raised us alone He raped Diana More
than once She’s blocked it all out

Heather finally turns from the mirror to face Isaac

HEATHER
Will that speed things up a little

Isaac is startled though not entirely surprised He reaches
out to touch her

ISAAC

Itll help
HEATHER

Good

The sound of a SIREN outside barreling into the night

ISAAC

I know it was hard for you to tell me

that

Heather presses herself hard against him but doesn’t speak

ISAAC
Stay the night The hell with Jimmy

Heather’s eyes shine

HEATHER
He’d kill us both

She pushes away from him and quickly crosses to the door As
Isaac follows her out we HEAR

INT ISAAC’S OFFICE DAY
Diana is lying on the couch

DIANA
Did you talk about me

Isaac sits in the Eames chair A beat then

ISAAC
No We didn’t

DIANA
Are you two lovers

ISAAC
Why do you want to know

DIANA
Because I keep imagining it

TSAAC
How does that make you feel When you
imagine it

Diana considers Then changes the subject

DIANA
I had the dream again

In a somnolent monotone as though instantly selfhypnotized

DIANA
I’m arranging a centerpiece of flowers
on a table I use fancy paper to
decorate the flowerpot the paper
feels like velvet and there are
three kinds of flowers

ISAAC
What kinds

DIANA
Lillies carnations

She trails off

After

Isaac

Diana

TSAAC
What’s the third kind Diana

DIANA
Violets

lights a cigarette

ISAAC
Violets

turns her head to see him

DIANA
Does that mean something

ISAAC
What do you think

just stares

ISAAC
Let’s say the table is you Diana
Compared to your sister you see
yourself as plain flat
uninteresting

doesn’t contradict this

ISAAC
The centerpiece of flowers perhaps
» is your sexuality And the
connection between purity and lust
the missing piece of the puzzle is
violets

makes a dismissive face

DIANA
Violence are just flowers

ISAAC
Violence

DIANA

I didn’t say that

TSAAC
What did you say

DIANA
(flustered)
I said violates

She catches herself

DIANA
Violets Godammit - violets

Abruptly she sits up and swings her feet over the side of the
couch so she’s facing Isaac She looks upset

DIANA
Why
ISAAC
(gently)
Perhaps it relates to something in your
past that you’ve put away

As though panicked by this suggestion

DIANA
Theyre just flowers Dr Barr I used
to do floral arrangements Why does

everything always have to be about sex

Isaac remains impassive

ISAAC
Tell me more about this fancy paper
that feels like velvet

DIANA
(heatedly)
You mean something gross like it’s
pubic hair I knew you’d say that

ISAAC
No you said it

Diana glances at her watch Then swings her legs off the
couch

ISAAC
Where’re you going

DIANA
Hour’s up

As she starts to rise

ISAAC
I did see your sister last night We
did talk about you

Diana sinks back onto the couch

DIANA
What about me
ISAAC
About your father
DIANA
(beat then)
It’s true
ISAAC
What’s true
DIANA
I wanted him to be dead And he did
ISAAC
He did
DIANA
Had a heart attack Dropped dead And
I was happy
ISAAC

And why were you happy

DIANA
Because he hated me Once he was dead
we were finally free We could start
fresh come to New York

ISAAC
Whose idea was that

DIANA
Oh Heather has all the ideas I just
I just agree with her

off the dance floor making a point of passing Isaac

Heather hasn’t noticed him until Jimmy is standing right in
front of Isaac’s stool

JIMMY
Were you just giving me a look

Heather is stunned She quickly recovers tugging his arm

HEATHER
C’mon Jimmy
Jimmy won’t let it go

JIMMY
Was that a look you were giving me

Heather’s eyes flick to Isaac pleading with him to back off

ISAAC
It was a look of admiration
Heather inhales -- oh God what next

I’m a fan of yours Of all the great
builders Le Corbusier Donald Trump

manages to pull him away back to their table

his face to dry it --

JIMMY
You little pricks over at Justice

off my ass Remember Shit flies two

ISAAC
Shit definitely flies two ways

Jimmy takes a step closer

JIMMY
I’m memorizing your cute puss Cause
if I catch you even glancing at me
again I’ll pry out both your fucking
eyeballs

Isaac stands his ground

Without warning Jimmy SMACKS Isaac’s cheek - with an open
hand but hard

Isaac swings at Jimmy’s face but Evans is quick and the blow
is glancing at best

Jimmy pushes Isaac against the sink He’s about to punch him

attention but his eye keeps wandering to the window

THROUGH THE WINDOW
We see the feet and legs of passing pedestrians OVER

Now they’re saying condoms may not work

and I don’t even like condoms

A bum hobbles by one oversized shoe and one bare foot Then
a Woman with a dog and a pooper-scooper

So do I wait Or do you think this is
all some kind of defense

Then a pair of shapely calves the feet in expensive pumps

Do you think maybe I’m afraid of sex

Isaac has a feeling about those legs It’s all he can do to
turn back to his patient

What do you think

The Patient carefully considers this for a beat

PATIENT
That’s an interesting question

peers through the blinds to see whether Isaac is occupied

HEATHER
That looks terrible

ISAAC
Now we both bear the Mark of Jimmy By
the way he thought I was with the
Justice Department cC’mon Heather
Do I dress that bad

Heather isn’t amused

HEATHER
That’s why psychiatry is the
impossible profession Psychiatrists
are impossible More narcissistic

than any of your patients

ISAAC
I just felt a neurotic masochistic
stupid need to see him See you
dance with him

Heather involuntarily shudders
HEATHER

After the other night with you I
can’t bear him touching me

TSAAC
Leave Divorce him
HEATHER
It’s not that easy He’d still be
around And I’d I’d still be who I
am Divorce it’s just a legalism
ISAAC

But a fairly definitive one
Heather grabs Isaac’s shirt pulls him to her

HEATHER
Let’s not talk Let’s just fuck --

Isaac holds her off
ISAAC
Why do you think -- really think -- you
can’t walk out on Jimmy Because he’s
Greek Orthodox A gangster No it’s
because he’s what you understand in a
man what you expect from a man
That and fucking So far I bet
youve been fucked by every man
youve ever known But it doesn’t have
to be that way You have a choice

Isaac and Heather stand at a cash register The CASHIER

rings up Kleenex Nyquil
Next to them a CRONE pleads with the pharmacist
CRONE
You don’t need a prescription to have
pain do you I need Demerol I’m
an MD godammit” A Doctor of Misery
Heather sneezes again

CASHIER
Go ahead Take the Nyquil

Heather gratefully opens the box unscrews the cap Sips

Jokes

HEATHER
You sound like a child

The doorman opens the door for Heather She turns to shoo
Isaac away And then softly

HEATHER
Shit

Isaac starts to turn around to see what Heather sees over
his shoulder

HEATHER
Don’t turn Just come in

BEHIND ISAAC

A long shiny black limo is gliding up to the curb
INT LOBBY - EVENING

Heather quickly leads Isaac past the doorman Softly

ISAAC
Is it him

HEATHER
I don’t know

They move to the elevators in a bank off to the side She
presses Up Both anxiously look up at the floor indicator
above the car door

THE INDICATOR

As 2 blinks off and Lobby blinks on Behind them the
CLACKING of a man’s SHOES approaching

IN THE ELEVATOR

As the door opens and Isaac and Heather quickly board Isaac
presses Door Close

A hand reaches in jolting open the door And --

- a harmless old GENT in coke-bottle glasses boards He
brings his face close to Heather’s Squints

GENT
Evening Mrs Evans

Heather manages a smile as Isaac presses Door Close again

GENT
We haven’t seen you at the co-op
meetings lately Lots of changes New
chandelier in the lobby
The car stops on 4 and the Gent gets off

GENT
Night now

HEATHER
‘Night

She opens the door for him He pauses to kiss her

ISAAC
Call me

EXT ALLEY - EVENING - TWO MINUTES LATER

Isaac exits the building into a shadowy alley where trash is
collected Then humiliatingly slips in some slick stuff

Isaac gets to his feet Collects himself -- and his dignity
-- then darts out of the alley and hurries down the block

CUT TO
INT HEATHER’S LIVING ROOM EVENING

Heather stands here sipping more Nyquil Muffled through
the walls she hears a strange unearthly TRAMPING sound

INT BATHROOMSPA EVENING

It is Jimmy on the treadmill in running shoes and shorts --
hirsute pouring sweat feet POUNDING An almost fascistic
picture of power in motion

Heather stands in the doorframe watching the spectacle He
instantly senses her presence Without looking at her
JIMMY
Were meeting Joe Giannatasio at Tre
Scalini at eight

A smile of contempt crosses her lips

HEATHER
I’m in for the night I have a cold

She sips her Nyquil

JIMMY
Two weeks I’m holding reservations

Heather’s response is to take another sip of Nyquil

Jimmy shuts off the treadmill

JIMMY
Cmon Go to your room Make yourself
gorgeous

HEATHER

I’m staying in I’m sick
She swigs again on the Nyquil Jimmy crosses for a towel
JIMMY
Youre sick Now tell me something I
don’t know

On don’t he swats the Nyquil out of her hand The bottle
goes flying shatters against the mirrored wall cracking it

JIMMY
Shit You’re paying for that --

A cruel glint in his eye He brings the towel to his face
JIMMY
Take off your clothes Get down on
your knees

He vigorously dries the sweat from his forehead and --

Heather reaches for the nearest dumbbell Grips it with
both hands and swings it at his temple

It connects with a hideous CRACK the impact sending Jimmy
over the side of the Jacuzzi into the bubbling water

All we see are his feet bobbing and the towel still
covering his face like a shroud A stain spreads on it
then the towel floats away revealing eyes open in surprise
turning the water a sick fizzy pink -- and Heather SCREAMS
FADE OUT As the SCREAMS subside we FADE UP ON

EXT RIKERS ISLAND - NEXT MORNING

The sun rises on the Rock fabled and forbidding

A cab pulls up at the gate Isaac climbs out shows his card
to the prison guard enters

INT WAITING ROOM - MORNING

Diana is wedged between an old Latino Man mumbling prayers in
Spanish and a Young Tough who jumps up every few seconds
swears and sits down again

As Isaac enters Diana flies into his arms

DIANA
What’re they gonna do to her

Isaac pats her shoulder

ISAAC
I don’t know
(then)
What happened Do you

DIANA
They found him -- Jimmy with his
head um crushed I guess

Isaac winces He feels sick disbelieving

DIANA
And she she’s not sure - what -

OFF-SCREEN we HEAR

C0’S VOICE
Barr

INT VISTTORS’ AREA - MORNING
Three big barred windows and a row of picnic-style tables

On the far side of the tables sit the female prisoners
(mostly young black) in drab jumpers Guarding them are a
dozen C0’s male and female black and white On the near
side of the tables sit the visitors husbands boyfriends
girlfriends parents There is a multilingual BABBLE

Isaac sits -- hunched apprehensive -- on the visitors’ side
of the picnic table The chair opposite is empty

Through CLANGING steel DOORS at the far end of the Visitors
Area comes Heather escorted by a female CO Heather’s skin
is chalky hair greasy and limp eyes swollen from crying

Spotting Isaac she breaks away from the C0 swiftly moves
to the chair opposite and sits

ISAAC
Are you okay

Heather mimes that she needs a ciagrette Isaac shakes one
out for himself too lights them both Then

ISAAC
He found out about us Attacked you

Heather shakes her head

ISAAC
Threatened you

HEATHER
(fights for control)
It wasn’t like that We were talking
a fight but nothing unusual
and then God I just snapped like --

She brings the cigarette to her mouth with a trembling hand

HEATHER
Like those other times

ISAAC
What other times

HEATHER
The feeling that came over me Losing
control Going crazy -

ISAAC
When
HEATHER
But this time I didn’t have a drink
ISAAC
What
HEATHER
I was going to tell you but it’s
not easy for me I guess I wanted

you to think I was perfect

She laughs -- softly bitterly

HEATHER
Something happens to me when I drink
It’s horrible I become I don’t
know what I become I can’t remember

ISAAC
Have you seen a doctor for this

Heather half-nods

ISAAC
And did they diagnose it
Heather shakes her head -- she can’t think
ISAAC
Did they call it -- would you remember
- “pathological intoxication
Heather frowns tilts her head -- maybe
HEATHER
I don’t know --
TSAAC
But you said you didn’t have a drink --
HEATHER
Of course not I know I can’t drink
ISAAC
Okay What did you do
HEATHER
I went into the bathroom Had
some more Nyquil Jimmy was there --
Isaac blinks of course
ISAAC
The Nyquil You drank how much
HEATHER

(shrugs)
A few sips Quite a few

Isaac leans across the table
ISAAC
Don’t you know that Nyquil is twenty-
five percent alcohol

Heather looks baffled

ISAAC
You didn’t know what you were doing --

HEATHER
Isaac I’m not crazy --

ISAAC
But youve been treated for this am I
right For pathological intoxication

HEATHER
I’ve been they brought me in to
um New York Hospital twice and

once to Lenox Hill
Isaac nods The wheels are spinning

ISAAC
Do you have a lawyer

Heather shakes her head Despairing
HEATHER
I don’t have a lawyer I don’t have
anything
Isaac places a steady hand on her trembling one

ISAAC
Yes you do Now you do

INT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN NIGHT (SEVERAL WEEKS LATER)
A large loud unruly MOB moves up the concrete ramp toward

the arena Among them we FIND Alan O’Brien and Isaac
Petitioning the conservative shrink

as a defense witness in this case

trying to prosecute for a pig’s age
Haven’t you noticed the birds chirping
more melodiously The children’s
laughter a little brighter America’s
a nicer country without that shitball

ALAN
I’m not stupid I know why you’re
determined to suck me into this
O’Brien turns to Isaac The soul of innocence

OBRIEN
What’s he talking about

ALAN
Several years ago I published a study

in the Archives of General Psychiatry
You want me to believe Isaac didn’t

mention that to you

As they find their entrance and move toward their seats

JUDGE COSTELLO presides

OVER

To the side is the jury -- mixed race mostly blue collar

They attentively listen to Assistant DA DONALD BRARKHAGE as
he delivers his opening statement Brakhage has the build of
Dick Butkus and the mien of Bruce the Shark

BRAKHAGE
They’1ll bring in so-called experts to
say she wasn’t in her right mind

At the defense table Terribly pale terribly pretty

BRAKHAGE’S VOICE
But ladies and gentlemen of the jury

until he’d turned his back then
savagely

He lifts a dumbbell off the prosecution table Raises it in
a way that emphasizes its weight

BRAKHAGE
swung a heavy dumbbell at his head

On head Brakhage SMASHES the dumbbell down onto the
tabletop producing a shocking terrible THUD

IN THE GALLERY
Spectators flinch Even Isaac

TIME CUT

OBRIEN
as he delivers his opening statement to the jury

O’BRIEN
Impressive wasn’t it Though I think
Raymond Burr did it first in A Place
In The Sun with an oar But what
Mr Brakhage didn’t say was that that
dumbbell over there is not the object
that killed Jimmy Evans The actual
dumbbell was never recovered If
indeed it was a dumbbell You see
whatever object was used and whatever
really happened in that bathroom on
that night can never be known beyond a
reasonable doubt

He gestures at Heather - she looks small frail and afraid
O’BRIEN
Because Heather Evans has no memory of
the events of that night As we
proceed you’1l see this is consistent
with our plea

HEATHER
Hi
Isaac is silent He looks strained and tense

HEATHER
Is something wrong Diana

TSAAC
Diana’s fine You forgot to mention
that you’re the sole beneficiary of
your husband’s life insurance policy

Heather looks confused
ISAAC
Or is that another thing you were
waiting to tell me

HEATHER
Whatre you saying

ISAAC
Just that if the jury finds that you
werent responsible you walk out of a
hospital in a month or so and collect
two million tax-free bucks

HEATHER
But that’s impossible

Impassioned Heather is shaking her head
HEATHER
No No Jimmy would never have named
me beneficiary
Isaac’s looks says he did
Heather’s hand flies up to her mouth
HEATHER
My god - did he -- do you think it
means he loved me

As though this were the most terrifying possibility

Isaac impassively lights a Camel as Heather tries to hold

herself together
Isaac just puffs And presently Heather realizes

That’s why you’re here You think

Now she rises Backs away looking mortified

BRAKHAGE
Dr Grusin have you examined the
defendant Heather Evans

GRUSIN
Yes I have

BRAKHAGE
Did you find Mrs Evans to be suffering
from any illness that could impair her
normal functioning

GRUSIN
No I did not

BRAKHAGE
What about Pathological Intoxication

GRUSIN
I found no evidence of it whatsoever
(glances at the jury)
And ft doubt that anyone but a defense
attorney would either

Muffled TITTERS in the gallery The ferocious-looking black
man breaks into a little smile

O’BRIEN
Objection Your Honor Move to strike

JUDGE
Sustained The jury will disregard the
witness’s last statement

BRAKHAGE
Doctor why do you doubt the existence
of so-called Pathological Intoxication

GRUSIN
Discussion of this disorder is I
believe simply an attempt to dazzle a
jury with pseudoscientific jargon
to convince them that alcohol exerts
magic evil powers on the brains of
just a few people
O’BRIEN
Objection The witness is stating an
opinion Nothing more

JUDGE
That’s what he’s here for counselor
He’s an expert witness Overruled

Brakhage smiles turns back to Grusin

BRAKHAGE
Why pseudoscientific Doctor

GRUSIN
Because no one has ever shown any
physical evidence of Pathological
Intoxication

SEVERAL MEMBERS OF the JURY frown concerned

BRAKHAGE
What would constitute physical
evidence Dr Grusin

GRUSIN
A brain scan Genetic profile
Analysis of blood chemistry Things
that can be tested

OBRIEN
Are you aware that Heather was
brought to Roosevelt Hospital once and

treated with pathological intoxication

Mr O’Brien I testified on direct as
to my doubts that this illness
exists therefore how can I be expec--

In ah my experience only a very
small amount of alcohol is needed to
produce a severe psychotic reaction
TSAAC
Anxiously watching Wishing he could step in

Continuing in his most gentle solicitous tone

O’BRIEN
And yet a person suffering from
pathological intoxication may otherwise
show no evidence of mental disorder

Based on my experience I’d say that’s
o» ah correct

O’BRIEN
Thank you Doctor Your witness

Brakhage rises Confidently ambles to the witness stand

BRAKHAGE
Doctor you repeatedly make reference
to your experience with this obscure
disorder How many patients with this
condition have you actually treated

ALAN
During my fellowship training at the
Columbia Psychiatric Institute I had
the opportunity to conduct a study of
pathological intoxication My findings
were published in The Archives of
General Psychiatry In all there
were thirtyseven patients involved

A loud BUZZ in the courtroom

smiles to himself -- Brakhage blundered into their trap
BACK TO SCENE

But the DA hasn’t backed off -- instead he steps right in

beat their spouses to death

ISAAC

But what about someone who coldly plans
the death of another Isn’t that -- in

insist then aren’t all criminals
sick and shouldn’t all prisons become

can imagine a time when this whole city
will in fact be one enormous minimum
security psychiatric facility

Isaac takes another breath Then hurriedly stuffs his papers
back into his briefcase and strides off the dais

IN THE AUDIENCE

People trade rueful looks another promising young shrink
self-destructs

INT NEW DELHI RESTAURANT - THAT NIGHT
TRACK with Isaac as he crosses the crowded room to join
Alan and O’Brien washing down curries with Taj Mahal beer

O’BRIEN
Look who’s here The prophet Ezekiel

Isaac sits He looks pensive

ALAN
Congratulations That was perhaps the
most bizarre valedictory since Nixon’s
farewell to his White House staff

Isaac pours himself a beer takes several big gulps But he
hasn’t spoken yet or cracked a smile

O’Brien turns to Alan

OBRIEN
You know what the problem is this
dude doesn’t trust happiness Don’t
you witchdoctors have a name for it

ALAN
Anhedonia
(studies Isaac)
Actually I think what we’re seeing is
a crisis of commitment Typically in
a love triangle when the third party
is vanquished the lovers develop a -
ISAAC
Bullshit

OBRIEN
I know You’re uptight about taking on
the formidable Widow Evans piece of
work But think of the perks Park
Avenue condos Bavarian cars vacations
in Virgin Gorda And I figured you’d
end up with an ex-hippie social worker

Isaac ignores O’Brien turns to Alan

ISAAC
Have you ever had a patient with a
phony pathology

ALAN
(surprised)
You mean reporting bogus symptoms
dreams etc We’ve all had patients
like that

O’Brien listens intently as

ISAAC
And how do you proceed with patients
like that

ALAN

You dig beneath the phony pathology to
get to the real pathology There’s
always something there to stir up

He and O’Brien watch curious as Isaac ponders And then
abruptly rises

ISAAC
I gotta go

EXT MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT
O’Brien catches up to Isaac halfway down the block
O’BRIEN

Something not kosher with the sister
act Am I in the ballpark here

Isaac doesn’t answer - just keeps walking Fast
OBRIEN
Notice I’m not asking what ‘Cause

it’s over We won

By now Alan has caught up too

ISAAC
You won I helped my girlfriend get
away with murder

Alan pales

ALAN
Oh shit Oh shit I knew it In my
gut -- oh God --

OBRIEN

Get a goddam grip on yourself
Then back to Isaac moving so fast now he’s nearly jogging
OBRIEN
I don’t want to know anything about it
Just make it right somehow

ISAAC
I’1l1 do what I have to do

OBRIEN
No police no publicity
ALAN
(terrified babbles)
You dragged us into this -- you gotta
fix it Isaac --

O’Brien glares at Alan again When he turns back Isaac has
sped into a full-out sprint leaving his friends behind

INT CAB - NIGHT (MOVING)

Isaac in the back seat restlessly bounces his knee up and
down taps his teeth As the cab brakes he looks up

ISAAC

Instantly the light turns green The cab lurches ahead

Revved almost manic he impatiently listens as

visiting hours The inmates are alr--

ISAAC
I know But listen I have to finish

realized I’m missing some data And
I’m gonna get killed if I don’t have it
first thing in the morning --

CUT TO
INT CHART ROOM NIGHT (5 MINUTES LATER)

An Orderly escorts Heather into the room She is surprised
to find Isaac here pacing

HEATHER
Hi What’s going on

Isaac waits for the orderly to exit Heather takes a step
forward steals a quick kiss Then pulls away when Isaac
doesn’t kiss back Off her questioning look

ISAAC
When you married Jimmy were you already
planning to kill him Or did the plan
just sort of evolve

HEATHER
What

TSAAC
Right what What about me Are you
gonna eat a bowl of cherries jubilee
and then push me in front of a bus

HEATHER
Isaac please this is crazy --

ISAAC
Crazy maybe but clever too sending me
your sister -- how concerned and
compassionate and I fell for it I
believed every word I thought
finally -- something real But all

along you were just sucking me in

Heather’s tone is simultaneously pleading and piercing

HEATHER
Don’t turn on me You’re the only man
I ever trusted

She moves toward him again Isaac pushes her off

ISAAC

You forgot about one phenomenon
transference The bond a patient
develops with the doctor who listens to
her analyzes her counsels her
it’s such a powerful force even a
phony patient will start to feel
something you might call love

(then)
Diana told me everything How you came
to court watched me testify
Auditioning me for the part

Heather sinks onto the nearest chair Weakly

HEATHER
Diana doesn’t love you

ISAAC
But she thinks she does You let her
Lie on my Couch week after week free
associating fantasizing fabricating
Well that gives a psychiatrist
some insight And a degree of control

When Heather looks up we see that she is crying

HEATHER
Get out of here I never want to see
you again

Isaac lights a Camel He’s riffing on anxiety overdrive

ISAAC
But you will -- every six months Oh
yes you will I’11 be on the
evaluating committee that visits you
We’ll consider how you’re interacting
with other patients look at the
paintings and little clay sculptures
you’ve done in art therapy See
it’ll be quite awhile before you get
out -- once you’re stuck ina maxinum
security psychiatric hospital your
civil rights sort of evaporate
Yes and -- do you know about the anti-
psychotic drugs The side effects
Speech impairment Facial twitches

Heather dries her eyes Stands Steps toward Isaac and puts
a hand on his cheek Even in extremis she is ravishing

HEATHER
You wouldn’t do that

Isaac stubs out his Camel A bitter laugh

ISAAC
You know I would’ve done anything for
you Except what I did for you

Then he turns and walks out of the chart room gesturing for
the Orderly to take her away

INT CORRIDOR - A MINUTE LATER

As a distressed Heather is escorted back to her room

HEATHER
I need to make a call
ORDERLY
In the morning lady
HEATHER
It’s a family emergency -- I need to
phone my sister -
A second Orderly opens the door to Heather’s room -- a dorm-
type arrangement with seven other women and the escorting

Ordlery roughly pushes her inside
EXT KIRBY FORENSIC - NIGHT - SAME TIME

Isaac walks out his body twisted from tension the pain of a
near-migraine evident on his face

He kicks a piece of trash on the steps and emits a string of
frustrated curses Suddenly --

-- a hulking FIGURE steps from out of the shadows blocking
him Isaac startles

FIGURE
Isaac Barr

The Black Man from the trial He’s nearly a head taller than
Isaac and twice as wide He’s smiling but somehow were not
reassured His voice is gutteral effortlessly threatening

BLACK MAN
How’s Heather

TSAAC
Who are you
A beat then a badge glimmers in Isaac’s frightened face

BLACK MAN
Huggins Homicide

Isaac relaxes but not much

ISAAC
What can I do for you
HUGGINS
How’s Heather
ISAAC
She’s fine
HUGGINS
You look upset Could use a shower
too What’d she tell you she ain’t

gonna share the two million with you

Isaac’s mind whirls The silence is punctuated by a lunatic
WOMAN’S shrill SCREAMS from inside the building

ISAAC
I have a report due in the morning I
needed some data so I --

HUGGINS
Don’t yank my dick Night of the
murder some stud walked into the
building with Heather Hinky thing no
one saw this stud walk out

With all the cool he can muster

ISAAC
Sounds like an interesting lead Why
didn’t you follow up on it

HUGGINS
Doorman’s a pillhead on parole Geezer
who rode upstairs with the happy couple
is legally blind Even if one of ‘em
made an ID in court it’d be worth zip

TSAAC
But you think it was me with Heather

HUGGINS
At this juncture I know it was But
without a murder weapon I can’t do
jack Meantime you’re the expert
witness The lawyer’s your best
friend The sister’s your patient and
youre banging the accused And I
don’t have a fucking murder weapon

He glowers at Isaac Who tentatively steps around him
TSAAC

I wish I could help you with that

Detective Now if you don’t mind I’m

going home to take that shower
He steps down to the cab waiting at the curb
Huggins watches as Isaac’s cab pulls off into darkness

CLOSE NIGHTSTAND
As the PHONE on it RINGS It’s a cute pink phone we’d expect
to find in the room of a teenage girl The clock next to the
phone says it’s 700 am

On the third RING a hand grabs at the receiver knocking the
clock and several vials of tranquilizers off the nightstand

DIANA’S VOICE
(groggy hoarse)
What --
INTERCUT HEATHER in
INT KIRBY FORENSIC MORNING
On the pay phone in the dayroom The hollows around her eyes
suggest she was up all night waiting to make this call -- and
did at the first opportunity She sounds measured steely

HEATHER
What did you tell him

INT DIANA’S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

A one-bedroom whose cutesy decor has been eerily overwhelmed
by dirty dishes tossed clothes and old magazines Like the
bachelorette pad of a stewardess with a mood disorder

Diana phenomenally unkempt valiantly tries to sit up

DIANA
Who

Desperately trying to shake off her sleeping-pill hangover

HEATHER
isaac
DIANA
I I told him the -- the dream

(trying to please)
The one we picked with the violets --

HEATHER
You fool You fell in love with him

DIANA
Wh-what do you mean I -

HEATHER
You want to tell me how he found out

This brings Diana to full consciousness

DIANA
He found out

HEATHER
Yes and he said you told him

DIANA
I didn’t tell him shit

HEATHER
If you’re lying to me --

DIANA
Don’t accuse me Youre the one who
fucked him

Furious -- she’s getting nowhere -- Heather hangs up
cur To
INT ISAACS OFFICE THAT AFTERNOON

Diana has had a few hours to pull herself together put her
sweet girl persona back in place As she lies down

DIANA
When someone’s been traumatized
even if everything came out okay in the
end that person can sometimes still
show signs of - trauma Can’t they
Diana is silent Isaac lights a cigarette Carefully

ISAAC
I’m not sure I know what you mean

DIANA
Well like my sister Even though was
found Not Responsible she is still
under stress and I wondered

ISAAC
Did something happen between you two

ISAAC
The kind of stress you’re talking about
can manifest itself in bizarre ways
In paranoia that might result in
certain kinds of mental distortions

DIANA
You mean like lies

Now Isaac is silent He puffs and waits

Isaac

Diana

Diana

Isaac

Diana

DIANA
Is it possible that Heather is jealous
of us you and me Because she’s
locked up and we’re yknow -- free

sighs stubs out his cigarette

ISAAC
Diana I think it’s time we had a talk

instantly sits up as though jolted
ISAAC
You know how I feel about Heather But
you’re my patient and that comes first

is nearly breathless with apprehension

DIANA
What Tell me -

is deeply sorry but
ISAAC
Heather’s trying to cut a deal with the
DA She’1ll tell a grand jury that you
were an accessory to Jimmys murder

lets out a shocked gasp She can’t speak

ISAAC
What’s so unfair is she made you do
it Pressured you Didn’t she

Diana starts to hyperventilate

ISAAC
And now she’s trying to sell you down
the river

Finally Diana articulates four strangled words

DIANA
-- but she’s my sister --

ISAAC
Exactly

CUT TO
EXT KIRBY FORENSIC - DAY

Isaac and Heather stroll the grounds bounded by barbed wire
under leaden skies that promise rain

Heather nods at an older woman standing in the middle of a
small grassy area making weird signs with her hands

HEATHER
That’s LaLa All night she stands at
the window mumbling You can’t sleep
When you ask what she’s doing she says
she’s praying for the Jews

TSAAC
What did you want to tell me --
HEATHER
I want to talk to you Try to make you
see why I did what I did It

wasn’t for the money more like -

ISAAC
For two million Of course not -

HEATHER
a kind of suicide --

ISAAC
- called murder -

HEATHER
I lashed out at my husband my
marriage myself as victim

HEATHER (Contd)
I was crazy but not in a way you
could understand in any clinical --

ISAAC
Oh I understand All my training my
experience it’s about understanding

why people do what they do to each
other And how they justify it

He lights a Camel drags deeply on it

HEATHER
Look I don’t blame you I used you
and I lied to you But I also fell in
love with you That night in your bed
you branded me with your tenderness TI

belong to you --

ISAAC
No The seduction is over

Heather grabs his cigarette and steals a puff

HEATHER
You won’t listen --
ISAAC
Yes I will Tomorrow in fact I’m

bringing two Assistant DA’s -- they’d
like to hear your whole story Heather

HEATHER
I’ve been found Not Responsible Ever
heard of double jeopardy I can’t be
tried twice for the same crime

ISAAC
If youre so sure of that why is your
hand shaking

Heather looks down the cigarette is indeed twitching between
her fingers She drops it smothers it with her shoe

HEATHER
Call off the DA’s Isaac Don’t you
remember the little lead pipe you held
that night in your living room

Isaacs eyes narrow as he remembers

HEATHER
That was the handle of a dumbbell

The grounds around Isaac seem to blur a bit and almost start
to spin
HEATHER
I hoped it wouldn’t come to this You
don’t know how sorry I am that it has

Isaac abruptly leans forward Gives her a quick hard kiss

ISAAC
Well see you tomorrow at noon

CUT TO
INT DIANA’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON (LATER)

Diana lies limp on the bed The tv is CHATTERING but she’s
studying the ceiling sunk in daydreams

The phone’s SHRIEK jolts her from her reverie She grabs it

DIANA
What

INTERCUT HEATHER in
INT KIRBY FORENSIC DAYROOM MORNING
On the pay phone again Resigned almost tragic but firm

HEATHER
Tomorrow Bring the dumbbell

Diana sits bolt upright

DIANA
What Why

HEATHER
Because I say to At noon Take care
when you handle it And be on time

Heather clicks OFF Diana is motionless for a moment Then
she hangs up

Takes a breath Stands and crosses to her closet

Very little is hanging mostly things have been thrown here
- a pile of dresses pants sheets shirts and shoes

Diana finds near the top of the pile a pair of thin white
gloves She pulls them on

DIANA
Okay The dumbbell

Then reaches under the whole pile feels around extracts
one two three baggies

A beat And then from Baggie One she removes the five-inch
chrome-plated handle with Isaac’s fingerprints

From Baggie Two a thick chrome-plated lead disk Diana
screws it onto one of the handle’s threaded ends Her hands
are shaking a bit so this takes some doing

Then she opens Baggie Three Inside is another such disk
This disk is heavily flecked with what appears to be - but
isn’t - rust And there are a few black hairs still stuck
to the rusty part

Diana retches Then manages to calm herself then decides
she’s going to vomit -- runs OUT of FRAME toward the
bathroom but it’s okay she’ll be okay She returns INTO

FRAME Carefully sinks to her knees and takes the disk
Starts to screw it onto the handle But her hand is wildly
shaking she can’t match the threads she curses and
loses her grip on the disk which hits the floor and rolls a
few feet Shit

She crawls after it Touches it and then - almost as though
it was alive -- the horrible bloody disk rolls another foot

Frustrated and unnerved Diana brings her gloved hands to her
face and SCREAMS

CUT TO
INT CONFERENCE ROOM NEXT DAY

At Kirby It is conspicuously quiet here Isaac sits beside
two 50ish men in blue suits -- the Assistant DA‘s

Guarded by a burly female Orderly Heather sits opposite

HEATHER
I gather youve heard his version

A perfunctory nod in Isaac’s direction

HEATHER
Now are you ready for the truth

The DA’s look a tad surprised at her intensity

DA 1
Of course Ms Evans
HEATHER
I’ve invited my sister She’ll
corroborate what I have to say

DA 1 nods that’s fine To the Orderly

DA 1
You’1l allow Ms Evans’ sister in the
moment she arrives

He turns back to Heather In a solicitous tone

DA 1
In the meantime why don’t we begin

HEATHER
I should have a lawyer present but my
lawyer is his best friend

Again a nod at Isaac Trying to conceal her irritation

HEATHER
I tried to replace him but the Judge
won’t let me - because I was recently
found to be temporarily insane -- so I
have to defend myself on my own

DA 2
(gently)
Don’t worry Ms Evans We’1ll listen
carefully and impartially to anything
you want to tell us

Heather’s looks says I wish I could believe that

HEATHER
My sister is one of his patients He
and I met a few times to discuss
family matters And in the course of
that we we began an affair

Isaac shakes out a cigarette Lights it Nervously puffs

HEATHER
When Isaac first suggested killing my
husband I thought he was joking But
he knew I suffered from pathological
intoxication and he became obsessed
insisting we had the makings of

She pauses It’s tough to articulate such an alien concept

HEATHER
the perfect murder

The DA’s make copious notes Isaac sits smoking

HEATHER
One night Isaac followed me home He
was excited agitated I begged him to
leave but he came upstairs and he
did it He hit Jimmy Isaac hit
Jimmy with a dumbbell

The conference room door opens Diana is led in by a second
Orderly who remains in the room Diana carries a briefcase

Isaac anxiously eyes it

HEATHER
I was horrified I think Isaac was
too He just sort of ran out of the
apartment and then he called I don’t
know five minutes later from a bar I
think Said I’d better tell the police
I’d done it after sipping Nyquil

The DA’s gravely stare at Isaac who gazes at the floor
drops his cigarette grinds it out

HEATHER
I - did as I was told

She momentarily cracks Starts to softly cry
HEATHER
But I was thinking clearly enough to
hide the dumbbell Isaac used I know
that was wrong - concealing evidence
but I’ve been so scared
It’s too much for her -- she breaks down

The DA’s uncomfortably shift Isaac puffs Diana digs
into her purse and finds a tissue for her sister

Heather pulls herself together Between sniffles
HEATHER
I asked Diana to bring this briefcase
today She doesn’t know what’s inside

A warm sisterly smile

HEATHER
Sweetie Let them have it

Diana dutifully hands the briefcase to the DA’s Isaac
watches tensing as DA 2 snaps it open Pulls out --

- a sheaf of sketchbook paper

Heather looks confused She grabs for the briefcase But
there is nothing else inside

THE PAPERS

Covered with demented scrawls in poster paint As the DA’s
leaf through them we note the phrase Dr Barr must die and
the name Isaac scribbled above the word Satan the two
connected with arrows

This was Bantar Man’s gift to Isaac

SCENE

Heather angrily grabs at the papers Then turns on Diana

HEATHER
Where’s the dumbbell

Her tone is harsh -- like the voice she’d used in Lutece
Diana cringes

HEATHER
Where did you get these From him

Shooting Isaac a lethal look Then to the DAs
HEATHER
He’s controlling her He forced her to
substitute these paintings

She whirls again on Isaac

HEATHER
They’re from the planet Bantar aren’t
they
The DA’s trade looks
HEATHER

How did you get her to bring them
Isaac You’re fucking her aren’t you

Isaac turns away Diana mortified is staring out a window

HEATHER
Answer you bastard

She flies out of her chair at Isaac The Ordleries grab and
restrain her Urgently petitioning the deadpan DA‘s
HEATHER
They’re in this together Do you see
They’re trying to frame me

DA 2
Of course Ms Evans

DA 1 snaps open his own briefcase Inside are medications

and syringes

Heather’s eyes widen as an Orderly yanks up her sleeve

HEATHER
What
And now she realizes
HEATHER
You’re doctors
As DA 1 -- actually Doctor 1 -- sinks in the syringe
DOCTOR 2

You know we’re doctors You’re just
a little confused right now

Explaining in infuriatingly gentle tones

DOCTOR 1
I’m with the Forensic Review Committee

DOCTOR 2
I consult with your late husband’s
insurance company
Heather starts flailing

HEATHER
You tricked me All of you --

DOCTOR 2
Youre very upset Ms Evans

Confirming this as she shouts to no one in particular

HEATHER
Liar

She struggles to break free Sotto to his colleagues
ISAAC

If I may I know Heather and I just
might be able to reach her
DOCTOR 1
Please Doctor

Isaac approaches Heather She stops struggling to hear what

he has to say Softly into her ear
ISAAC
You were right about double jeopardy
This was the only way
Heather freaks

HEATHER
Sonovobitch bastard -

The Orderlies cart her away We HEAR the muffled sounds of
SCREAMING they FADE as she’s dragged farther down the hall

Diana is standing mute and expressionless in a far corner

Stunned the two Doctors approach Isaac Quietly

DOCTOR 1
Jesus

DOCTOR 2
When you came in the other day with
your diagnosis we were well we
were skeptical

DOCTOR 2

There was no indication of psychosis
no prior history But

DOCTOR 1
She’s worse than you described her
Talk about paranoid Who did she
think we were District Attorneys

Isaac shakes his head -- he’s mystified

ISAAC

Maybe the anxiety of killing her
husband -- plus the repeated insults of
alcohol have produced a stress-
related organic psychosis

(shrugs)
I wouldn’t be surprised if there was
further deterioration

bocToR 1
Well want her reviewed in six months
Youre familiar with the case Dr
Barr You should be on the evaluation
team

ISAAC

I’ll try to find the time But you

know these cases can drag on

patients remain committed for years
The Doctors nod - they know They know

INT TAXI (MOVING) AFTERNOON
Isaac and Diana The aftermath She’s sobbing remorseful

Isaac pats her knee attempting to soothe her

TSAAC
It’s okay
Now the Cabbie does a typically wild maneuver -- veering
across four lanes -- and Diana’s head is whipped around

Isaac unloads all his tension on the Cabbie
ISAAC
Could you drive sanely please We’d
like to get there alive

The Cabbie grudgingly slows and Isaac turns back to Diana

ISAAC
You did the right thing The only
thing

DIANA
» Did I

She wears a doubtful look Begging for more encouragement

ISAAC
Now that you’re free of her you can
finally begin to be who you are

The faint trace of a hopeful smile crosses Diana’s lips
ISAAC
Youll see The caterpillar is going
to become a butterfly Diana
Then he adds as casually as he can
TSAAC
Meantime after all that’s happened we
should keep our distance for awhile

Diana’s smile flickers uncertain

ISAAC
So no one draws a conclusion that might
be dangerous to us both

Diana nods she sees his point

ISAAC
So all I need from you is the dumbbell
back Then well stay clear of each
other -- only for as long as necessary
of course

A long beat Then Diana pulls a Kleenex from her pocketbook
and dries her eyes Smiles again rather coyly

DIANA
Of course

CUT TO
INT STAIRWELL - ISAAC
follows Diana up a narrow flight of stairs into
INT DIANA’S APARTMENT DUSK
Weve been here before and seen how messy it is Now it’s
gotten even worse piles everywhere of clothing bedding
Magazines unreturned videotapes dishes and glasses

Diana seems gaily oblivious to the disorder as she beckons

DIANA
Come in Make yourself comfortable

Isaac cautiously closes the door behind him

DIANA
Can I fix you some tea Camomile
Mint

TSAAC

I shouldn’t stay Diana I just --

DIANA
Right Of course The dumbbell

She makes a cute girlish gesture Be right with you

Still standing by the door - ready to make a fast getaway
Isaac watches as she moves to her bedroom closet opens it

Massive clutter Diana kneels feels under all the dresses
and underwear she forgot to hang back up these past months
Then she starts sifting through all that stuff feeling
the dumbbell

Then she stands Scowls

DIANA
Hmm
Isaac steps forward
ISAAC
What
Diana snaps her fingers
DIANA

I know I hid it somewhere better
After that detective

ISAAC

After he started calling And then he
came by Poked around

ISAAC

DIANA
He wants it real bad So I hid it

A beat as she concentrates Then it comes back to her

DIANA

Diana crosses to her bed leans down feels under it frowns

Isaac crosses Joins her Feels too Nothing

DIANA
Shit

She straightens up Squints at the bed And remembers

DIANA
I couldn’t sleep with it there

She takes in a breath Surveys her apartment Exhales

DIANA
The dumbbell the dumbbell

She starts moving around throwing stuff off her nightstand
flinging things in the air

DIANA
Where did I put that dumbbell -

Moving faster like a dervish through the chaos upending
everything sending dirty sheets flying as she murmurs

DIANA
It’s here somewhere I know it’s here --

ANGLE ISAAC

As it starts to sink in that maybe she’s toying with him
and then he brightens as he HEARS

DIANA (OS)
A-ha

ANGLE DIANA
As she triumphantly waves it

DIANA
I havent seen this in weeks

But it’s not the dumbbell she’s found -- it’s Jimmy’s gun
BACK TO SCENE
Isaac startles as she recklessly waves the 38

ISAAC
Careful with that --

DIANA
Oh the safety’s always on

BLAM As the thing discharges a bullet ZIPPING past Isaac’s
ear and EXPLODING a lamp

ISAAC
Jesus Christ

Diana pauses to look at the gun then at Isaac to marvel

DIANA
I fired it Finally --

The neighbor below angrily BANGS on the ceiling

DIANA
Shuttup
(resuming the search)
Where the hell could it’ve gone I
mean dumbbells just don’t up and walk
out of a girl’s apartment right --

She brushes aside empty cereal boxes discarded shoes
Isaac now wears a small ironic smile

Diana feet firmly planted in the middle of the maelstrom
throws up her arms extravagantly befuddled

DIANA
I just don’t know what to say
ISAAC
Right
DIANA
I’m so embarrassed I mean I know

it’1ll turn up one day

Then an idea

DIANA
Yknow maybe in the course of my
therapy Maybe you’ll help me break

through my defenses and remember where
I put the damn thing

Isaac just nods He’s almost amused
DIANA
So I guess this butterfly will be
seeing you Tuesday At the regular
time

ISAAC
See you then Diana

He starts to turn to open the door but

DIANA
And by the way Daddy fucked Heather
not me
This stops Isaac cold
DIANA
He always preferred her - he wouldn’t
even let me sit in his lap

(beat)
If that helps any

ISAAC
It’s all grist for the mill

He turns now opens the door Walks out acutely aware that
there’s an unstable young woman behind him with a loaded gun

Diana watches her psychiatrist go wearing a satisfied smile

Which disappears as a thought crosses her mind She quickly
moves to the stove Opens the oven to check that the pilot
light is still on

It is
FADE OUT Then slowly FADE UP ON
INT ISAAC’S MOTHER’S BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING

Some time has passed -- the quality of the light through the
blinds has changed

Isaac sits on the couch opposite his mother’s bed They both
look thin pallid They’re both staring into space

Now Isaac jots some notes on the legal pad in his lap

ISAAC
(murmurs as he
writes)
Trouble sleeping Appetite loss
Lack of concentration

He looks up at his mother

ISAAC
Yeah I know what they’re symptomatic
of But I’m not - How could I be

woman who She lied she --

He’s interrupted by the RINGING phone Then Isaac’s clipped
prerecorded MESSAGE followed by

showing up again

In bg we HEAR the DIN of a CROWD O’Brien is calling from
a public phone in a stadium it sounds like Next we HEAR

Can’t you be a tad less borderline
Gooden’s starting against the Dodgers

Exercise class A dozen women stretch bend etc Most are
stiff out of shape Some make bizarre gestures in the air
All look shabby and desperate in this dingy awful dayroom
Heather slouches in the corner Tired and pale but still
possessed of grace and beauty Her strategy for coping is
apparently to pretend that she’s not here

She’s on a beach in the south of France - we can almost read
it in her eyes

A windowless little room -- a cell really -- where Isaac has
come to visit Heather in his role as Evaluator

ISAAC
Are you having trouble sleeping

There is a rudimentary desk between them a lamp on the desk
Her head is down -- her hair hangs a little greasy in front
of her face Concealing like a curtain

No answer from across the desk In a clinical voice
ISAAC

At night Do you find you have trouble
sleeping

Finally a response Muted but distinct

HEATHER
I love you
ISAAC
(beat - then
neutral)

Please answer my question
Heather looks up Her lovely face is streaked with tears

HEATHER
I love you

Isaac stares at her for a beat Then

TSAAC
Have you experienced loss of appetite

HEATHER
I love you

ISAAC
Difficulty concentrating

HEATHER
I love you

ISAAC
(stands)
Stop it Answer truthfully --

HEATHER
I love you

ISAAC
(erupts)
If you’d told me the truth I could’ve
helped you You couldn’t just leave
Jimmy any more than you could’ve walked
away from your father - I understand
that now I could’ve helped you but --

HEATHER
I love you
ISAAC
Enough Tell me the truth for once
HEATHER
I love you
ISAAC

Dammit The truth --

HEATHER
I love you

Isaac
Bullshit The truth

HEATHER
I love you
ISAAC
It’s true
The realization hits Isaac like a punch to the gut - almost

knocking him back against the wall
Two beats His voice now is as muted and fragile as hers

ISAAC
Christ What do we do

As she silently looks at him and he at her CAMERA SLOWLY
starts to rise higher and higher

Revealing walls that are twenty thirty forty fifty feet
tall and more until we are looking down on these two as
from a great height a pair of mice trapped in a mineshaft --

The CAMERA is still RISING as we slowly FADE to BLACK
