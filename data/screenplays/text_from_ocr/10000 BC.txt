The sound of wind --

SLOW FADE UP

EXT HIGH VALLEY - DUSK

We fly over softly swaying high grass As far as the eye can
see A NARRATOR speaks his voice weathered and wise

NARRATOR (VO)
It was already the last moon and on
many days the air smelled of the
white rain

Huge black boulders Fearsome mountain peaks covered by
eternal snow The land is beautiful primal

NARRATOR (VO) (CONTD)
But then the Mannak came later and
later and we feared that one day
he would bring us his blessings no
longer

Far in the distance we can make out a human settlement A
dozen huts built from mammoth bones and hide

The settlement seems deserted but as we move closer we see
there’s a fire flickering inside the biggest of the huts

NARRATOR (VO) (CONTD)
It was the time when the world of
the Yagahl was coming to an end and
the Ancient Fathers spoke to Old
Mother our dreamer about the fate
of our people

We hear CHANTING Wild Frenzied The raspy voice of an old
woman getting answered again and again by the shrill chorus
of many other voices

SMASH CUT TO

EXT OLD MOTHER’S HUT - NIGHT
Arms and hands--

Stretching out shaking to the rhythm of the music giving
strength to OLD MOTHER
She is the shaman of the tribe Her ancient face is painted
bright blue She stands in a circle formed by her people

The whole tribe is taking part in the ceremony They all
eagerly watch as their spiritual leader gets herself deeper
and deeper into her trance

Between the moving tribe members we make out a handsome boy
about ten years old He is YOUNG D’LEH There is something
very special about him perhaps the intelligence in his eyes

Instead of watching Old Mother’s ritual DLeh stares at a
girl sitting across from him She’s about his age and even
more beautiful than he She is YOUNG EVOLET She looks at
DLeh through the intervening people revealing stunning
bright green eyes

DLeh smiles at her Then he looks up to his FATHER who has
the same features as his son DLeh’s father wears a
distinctive ivory bracelet

TIC’TIC about the same age as DLeh’s Father stands nearby
listening intently to Old Mother TicTic is a hunter
thoughtful formidable though slightly less so than DLeh’s
father

He also stares at Old Mother whose shaking builds and builds
until

Abruptly and from unknown forces she is thrown backwards at
least a dozen feet collapsing into the open arms of her
people where she starts to whisper in a child-like voice

NARRATOR (VO)
In her dream she saw the Mannak
roam our valley in numbers beyond
counting And then she saw him
wander to the Great Mountains
forever

All the older people move forward and close in a tight circle
around her

NARRATOR (VO) (CONTD)
But we shall not fear A great
hunter will arise a warrior to
whom the daughter of her daughter
will bestow many children And he
will lead our people to a land
where two suns rise with the
morning dawn And there the
Yagahl will hunger no more
We hold on D’Leh’s father and Tic’Tic who look at each
other

NARRATOR (VO) (CONTD)
And Old Mother shared her dream
with the elders of our people

CUT TO

EXT VALLEY - NIGHT

Long grass sways in a soft breeze A full moon casts shadows
A solitary figure a young woman hurries through the grass
searching She stops before a ridge We see her green eyes
and realize she is Evolet the little girl from the ceremony
now a beautiful young woman of seventeen

SUPER and TITLE 10000 BC

She sees two figures sitting on a ridge silhouetted by the
pale light of the moon She moves quickly toward them

EXT LOW RIDGE LOOKING OVER VALLEY - NIGHT

DLEH sits on a rock carving a small piece of ivory
with a sharp-edged stone tool We realize from his face that
he is the boy from the ceremony now grown He’s working on a
small bead-sized mammoth which is nearly finished

BAKU 12 bright impatient sits next to DLeh playing with
a stick watching D’Leh

BAKU
When will the Mannaks come

D’Leh continues carving

D’LEH
When they want

BAKU
Why do they come later and later

D’LEH
Why don’t you ask them when you see
them

DLeh finishes the carving He pulls out a necklace made of a
string of similar small mammoths and ties on the new piece
completing the necklace
BAKU
When will Tic’Tic let me join the
hunt

D’ LEH

When you stop asking so many
questions

They hear FOOTSTEPS D’Leh hides the necklace and turns to
see Evolet coming their way DLeh sees that she’s troubled
She puts down a small food basket near Baku

EVOLET
Hungry little brother

Baku digs in MUMBLING his thanks through his stuffed mouth
Evolet gives DLeh a look then walks off DLeh rises and
follows her speaking back to Baku as he goes

D’LEH
Keep a good watch eh

Baku MUMBLES “yes” through the food in his mouth

EXT BEHIND THE RIDGE - NIGHT

Evolet walks through the tall grass with DLeh following a
few steps behind He savors the moonlit view of her She
feels his eyes but has something else on her mind something
urgent

She stops at a spot far enough from Baku to afford them some
privacy

D’ LEH
What’s wrong

EVOLET
Old Mother spoke with Tic’Tic in
our hut today

D’ LEH
Tic’Tic came to your hut

EVOLET
Old Mother told him he should not
be the one to slay the Mannak when
he comes

DLeh looks bewildered
EVOLET (CONT’D)

She wants Ka’ren to prove himself
so he can claim me She thinks him
the bravest of the young hunters
and she wants me to be his

D’LEH
(shocked)
Ka’ren He doesn’t care for you
he thinks only of the hunt
EVOLET

He considers me a worthy woman for
a great hunter

EXT RIDGE - NIGHT
Baku is still wolfing down the food from Evolet’s basket He
doesn’t realize that behind him a giant shadow has appeared

blotting out the stars

The shadow grows into a silhouette and we slowly realize it
has the shape of a mammoth

We hear a DEEP and RASPY BREATHING Baku turns and nearly
chokes on his food

The mammoth startles and lifts up his tusk An ear shattering
ROAR

IN THE TALL GRASS

DLeh and Evolet turn at the ROAR DLeh runs back toward the
ridge Evolet following

ON THE RIDGE

Baku stands frozen in fear before the great mammoth DLeh
runs past to the edge of the ridge By the moonlight he
sees

A MASSIVE HERD OF MAMMOTHS

More than a hundred animals The Mannaks have arrived
DLeh looks at Evolet and Baku They all turn and start to
run down the slope toward the village

EXT GRASSLAND - NIGHT

DLeh Evolet and Baku run DLeh shouts at Baku
D’ LEH
Go tell Tic’Tic

BAKU
Why me

D’LEH
Because I say it

Evolet looks at her little brother sharply Baku splits off
and runs up a rocky ridge

EXT TICTIC’S HUT - HIGH RIDGE - EARLY DAWN

The sky is turning a dark blue Baku reaches TicTic’s hut
which is high above the village Mammoth tusks line the
entrance a forbidding sight for Baku who slows and
reluctantly enters the hut

INT TICTIC’S HUT - EARLY DAWN

Darkness Baku doesn’t dare breathe

The boy looks around trying to make out things It seems the
hut is empty Baku sees something that captures his attention
-- a distinctive ivory-handled WHITE SPEAR

Baku is drawn to the spear unable to keep himself from
looking at it more closely He starts to reach out to touch

it when a SOUND behind him makes him spin

TicTic appears right behind Baku The old man’s face is
stern his wiry body already painted for the hunt

BAKU
Thethe Mannaks are here

TicTic knows -- he’s already painted and prepared
BAKU (CONTD)
The whole valley is full of them
There are so many
This has a profound impact on TicTic He passes the boy and
grabs the White Spear
EXT MAMMOTH HUNTER’S CAMP - DAWN

The rising sun is still below the mountains The hunters
prepare Checking their weapons gathering their gear

putting on body paint practicing throwing their spears at a
target made of mammoth bones and hide

There are a dozen hunters DLeh is somewhat separate from
the others Among the young hunters are

KAREN about DLeh’s age very imposing-looking athletic
MOHA somewhat smaller cocky

LU’KIBU same age a follower

All are focused and intent -- this is serious business
Karen grabs some spears and steps over to the target He
waits as two other hunters throw Their throws are good but

not great

Karen steps up and prepares to throw Most of the hunters
turn to watch DLeh pointedly does not

Karen lets loose with a stunning throw -- the spearhead
slams into the dead center of the target sinking much deeper
than any of the other throws

DLeh glances over Moha and LuKibu look at DLeh and
exchange a look

MOHA
I can see it in his eyes

LU’ KIBU
So can I it’s fear

They laugh lightly coolly derisive

LUKIBU (CONTD)
He’s afraid Ka’ren will win his
woman today

MOHA
Perhaps he’1ll run away like his
father

DLeh bristles Karen looks over and speaks sharply with
authority

KA’ REN
Moha Lu’Kibu quiet Your spears

Chastised but still sharing a smile they turn their
attention to their spears checking the bindings that hold
the heads to the shafts
Old Mother and Evolet arrive Evolet hangs back with some of
the other young women

DLeh and Evolet see each other On opposite sides of the
gathered tribe they lock eyes through the intervening
people

Old Mother steps among the hunters She stops in front of
Karen who is tying a SMALL WOODEN BOWL to his waist Old
Mother MURMURS A BLESSING which she finishes off by SPITTING
on Karen

Karen expected it but it’s still a bit off-putting He
keeps himself from wiping off her spittle and goes back to
preparing his weapons

Old Mother moves on blessing each of the hunters in turn
with the murmuring and the spitting One after another they
submit all somewhat reluctantly to her ministrations

TicTic walks into the camp followed by Baku TicTic blows
into a carved ivory hunting whistle hanging from his neck

Old Mother stops chanting

TicTic walks into the middle of the circle holding the White
Spear All eyes are on TicTic

TIC’TIC
The Mannak is great and we are
small but yet we kill him We
kill him because we hunt together
as one

His eyes wander across the faces of the hunters He stops at
DLeh’s

TicTic holds the White Spear

TIC’TIC (CONTD)
Today I will not pierce the heart
of the Mannak One of you will
drive the final blow

TicTic looks at all the hunters and then again at DLeh

TIC’TIC (CONTD)
One of you will claim the White
Spear

Several of the young hunters glance at Evolet She looks back
only at DLeh Ka’ren is not among the hunters who glance at
Evolet
TIC’TIC (CONTD)
May the Ancient Fathers and the
spirit of the Mannak choose the
best of you

He rams the White Spear in the middle of their circle

TicTic turns and strides off with the hunters close behind
The other members of the tribe follow to see them off

DLeh LAGS WITH Evolet DLeh takes out the necklace he
carved and hands it to her

D’LEH
I worked on this for many many
nights

She looks at the necklace deeply moved

DLEH (CONT’D)
You are here
(he touches his chest)
No matter who kills the Mannak you
will always be here

She’s overwhelmed He gives her a last smile then turns and
hurries after the hunting party Evolet looks after him
holding the necklace tightly

EXT GRASSLAND BY RIM - DAY

The sun peeks over the mountains Shapes appear between the
high grass which gently sways in the wind

TicTic is in the lead The other hunters follow crawling up
the incline hidden in the grass by their body paint

The CAMERA lifts over the rim and reveals a stunning image--
A HERD OF MAMMOTHS GRAZING ON AN OPEN PLAIN

More than a hundred of them The hunters share anxious looks
None of them has ever seen a herd this big

We pan over the herd passing a giant female nursing her
baby

After sizing up the situation TicTic turns to the others
and gives a hand signal All of the other hunters follow his
lead as he moves towards the herd

DLeh immediately starts to move faster than the others
getting a bit ahead of the group

TicTic makes a CLICKING INSECT SOUND getting DLeh’s
attention TicTic motions for DLeh to ease back to stay
tighter with the advancing group

D’Leh reluctantly slows waiting for the others joining with
them then pacing himself to stay with them

The hunters advance on the herd TicTic leads The animals
pick up their scent and begin to stir

TicTic signals the hunters They stop in a long curving
row

TicTic continues alone moving deeper and deeper into the
herd He passes the female mammoth and her baby very close
The baby eyes him curiously

TicTic zeros in on a giant mammoth the LEAD BULL TicTic
carefully approaches Sensing movement the lead bull turns
menacingly towards the approaching TicTic

The other mammoths in the herd react to the lead bull’s
movement and they turn as well A pause then they begin
grazing again

TicTic creeps closer still
The lead bull stops eating His trunk sniffs the air and the
animal makes a RUMBLING sound The lead bull looks down

towards TicTic trying to spot him with near-sighted eyes

D’Leh eases forward a bit Ka’ren and some of the other
hunters note DLeh’s movement They’re not pleased

Suddenly directly in front of the lead bull TicTic leaps
to his feet waving his arms SHOUTING wildly

The lead bull’s feet tear up the ground His massive head
whips back and forth

TicTic stands his ground He goes closer to the lead bull
and thrusts his spear at the animal’s face

THE MAMMOTH CHARGES TicTic ROLLS out of the way barely
avoiding being trampled

TicTic BLOWS HIS HUNTING WHISTLE

At that signal DLeh and the other hunters leap to their
feet waving their arms and SHOUTING

The rest of the herd spooked and furious SNORTS TRUMPETS
some rearing up on their hind legs

The herd charges after the lead bull with a sound like
rolling thunder

Their stampede leads them into a valley Far in the distance
we make out a rock formation a wide opening which we later
learn will lead into an increasingly narrow canyon

TicTic joins the other hunters running giving them hand

signals deploying them The hunters form themselves into a
crescent behind and to the sides of the running mammoths

herding them directing the big animals towards the canyon

opening

DLeh runs alongside the herd point man of one side of the
crescent DLeh focused only on the mammoths and not on the
other hunters runs faster putting distance between himself
and the others

TicTic sees DLeh and CALLS OUT angrily to him motioning
him back with the group but the thunderous sounds of the
Mammoths’ stampede drowns out TicTic’s voice

Karen looks angrily ahead at D’Leh Moha and LuKibu see
DLeh ahead of the group and exchange an angry look

Picking up speed D’Leh gets further ahead of the other
hunters

DLeh is now running ahead of some of the trailing mammoths
and some of those animals veer to the outside of D’Leh
driving him in among the main herd

TicTic sees this happen His anger grows but there’s
nothing he can do about it

We see big boulders looming ahead

With DLeh running among them two of the mammoths in the
center of the herd are spooked and start to veer off away
from the mouth of the canyon

Other mammoths in the herd respond and start to veer away
from the canyon mouth as well

TicTic sees the herd starting to change direction because of
DLeh TicTic motions to Karen Moha and Lu’Kibu who
tighten up on their side of the herd yelling driving the
herd back toward the canyon mouth

The lead bull has passed the boulders and now every animal
has to choose its route

DLeh runs between two massive animals who want to squeeze
between two of the giant stone boulders They scrape the rock
and their bodies crash together

DLeh’s only chance is to duck down and dive under the body
of one of the stampeding mammoths For a couple of endless
seconds he runs under the animal

But when the mammoth jumps over a smaller rock which is too
high for DLeh he has no choice other than to jump aside
tumbling to the ground where he’s nearly crushed by the feet
of the other mammoths

Karen Moha and LuKibu shoot him harsh looks as they pass
DLeh scrambles up but he has lost his lead

TicTic looks over angry but relieved that DLeh is alive

They run on now with DLeh behind the other hunters

EXT CANYON - DAY

Several elder hunters pull on two ropes The ropes are
attached to two heavy stones which are dragged up to the top
of finger-like rocks which form a bottleneck in the canyon

Baku nearby watches He HEARS THE HERD APPROACHING and he
scrambles up the sloping side of the canyon and sees the
stampeding animals approaching

BAKU
They are coming They are coming

The old men double their effort

EXT MOUTH OF THE CANYON

The lead bull has reached the mouth of the canyon which is
wide at the opening but narrows more and more towards the
other end

The mammoths’s bodies start to scrape along the jutting walls
of the narrowing canyon

Further ahead the old hunters await the herd with growing
anticipation They crouch on top of the two stone fingers

They look down on the lead bull which thunders past Then
group after group of animals does the same raising huge
clouds of dust

Baku stands on his lookout point and watches the spectacle
of the thundering herd and the hunters driving them into the
canyon

The clouds of dust make it difficult for him to see and he
strains to make out the end of the herd When he is finally
able to see that the last mammoth has passed he starts to
wave his arms furiously

This signals the old hunters that their prey is approaching
the trap

We see the LAST BULL racing towards the bottleneck The last
bull is massive nearly as formidable as the lead bull

At Baku’s signal the old hunters push down the two massive
rocks on each side of the stone fingers

A heavy net which was buried in the ground pulls up in
front of the bull and catches him in full stride The animal
screams out

The ropes stretch as the net barely contains the speed of the
raging animal For extra reinforcement the net is secured by
other ropes which are also attached to heavy stones they too
now get dragged over the ground

The bull slows down

We now discover two other old hunters hidden behind a rock
yanking another rope up off the ground It catches the legs
of the bull and he finally goes down with a terrifying roar

The hunters run in with Karen in the lead But D’Leh is
still far behind The mammoth struggles on its side
entangled in the net

KAREN GOES IN FIRST ready to take the day’s glory His
spear raised ready to throw Karen moves in boldly but
patiently waiting for the perfect moment

Karen climbs onto a boulder to have a better line-of-sight
The struggling mammoth is not an easy target His flailing
legs are in the way of his heart

But then Karen THROWS
His SPEAR hits the chest of the thrashing animal A good
throw but because of the flailing legs it was deflected The

wound angers the beast more than debilitating it

All the other young hunters now move in It is their chance
to throw their spears

When DLeh finally arrives he sees Lu’Kibu and Moha throw
their spears but their throws don’t do much harm

Now DLeh moves in It is his chance

But as DLeh prepares to throw Baku screams a warning

BAKU
Watch out

DLeh turns and sees Baku waving his arms in panic Then
everybody sees what Baku has seen

The giant FEMALE MAMMOTH with her BABY is stampeding towards
them

DLeh and the other hunters quickly jump aside to avoid being
trampled

Storming through the bottleneck of the canyon the mother
animal crashes into the ropes and the net that is holding
down the bull

The ropes rip away from the rocks

The baby mammoth follows and nearly gets caught in the torn
ropes As the baby SQUEALS the mother lets out a terrifying
ROAR and the mother and baby run after the herd until they
are out of sight

The bull struggles to get back on its feet

D’Leh moves in on the madly thrashing mammoth grabs a piece
of the net and pulls down It’s a mad nearly suicidal move
but one that inspires the other hunters

Everybody grabs whatever end of the net they can reach They
delay the mammoth for a moment but they are no match for the
gigantic animal which manages to get back on its feet and
starts to charge away dragging all the hunters along as they
cling to the net

The mammoth runs faster and faster and one by one the
hunters let go of the net

After a few hundred yards only two hunters remain -- DLeh
and Karen

Karen and DLeh look at one another The mammoth turns the
net swings behind and Karen is smashed against the side of
the canyon He loses his grip on the net and tumbles to a
stop

DLeh hangs on for another moment then realizes that he
too must let go He lets go of his grip then sees

His hand is tightly tangled in the net

He tries to free his hand but can’t

TicTic runs behind stopping watching as DLeh and the
Mammoth disappear behind a bend in the canyon

Moha and LuKibu appear by TicTic’s side

MOHA
He will get himself killed

TIC’TIC
Go back help the others

Moha and LuKibu run back toward the other hunters TicTic
runs after DLeh and the mammoth

EXT HIGH PLATEAU - DAY

The other side of the canyon opens onto a wide expanse of
savannah The high grass cushions the rough ride as DLeh is
dragged by the bull

In the background we see the giant female and her baby join
the rest of the herd which is still agitated but has slowed
down

As the CAMERA MOVES UP we see that the animal is racing
towards a steep cliff

DLeh still struggles to free his hand from the net

The mammoth passes a rock the net gets caught in it and
comes loose DLeh rolls to a stop

The mammoth comes to an abrupt halt at the cliff’s edge
DLeh is barely conscious Dazed and hurt he struggles to
get up

The bull turns toward him It REARS and BELLOWS in anger and
pain

DLeh continues to try to free himself from the net

The bull charges thundering down on him Unable to free his
hand DLeh can only jump out of the way The bull unable to
change direction as quickly as DLeh barely misses him

D’Leh rolls to his knees still struggling The bull turns
and charges again

DLeh finally manages to free his hand He jumps out of the
way again narrowly avoiding being killed

As DLeh scrambles to his feet he sees three spears sticking
out of the net They’re the spears thrown by Ka’ren Moha
and LuKibu DLeh pulls the spears out as the bull turns
toward him again

This time the bull does not charge immediately DLeh and
the mammoth stand opposite one another neither moving One
man against a mammoth impossible odds

ON A HILL IN THE DISTANCE TicTic runs up to the crest from
the other direction He sees DLeh and the mammoth

THE MAMMOTH ADVANCES SLOWLY preparing to charge DLeh backs
up holding the three spears looking around for cover
Nothing other than a few flat rocks

THE MAMMOTH CHARGES

DLeh throws the first spear It is a good throw but it
misses

THE MAMMOTH KEEPS COMING

He throws the second spear but it hits the mammoth in the
upper leg

THE MAMMOTH KEEPS COMING

He backs away holding the last spear pointed at the mammoth
Without looking he backs into a rock outcropping and the
butt of the spear becomes wedged between two rocks

THE MAMMOTH IS NEARLY UPON HIM

DLeh tries to free the spear but there is no more time

At a full run the mammoth hits the spear which sinks deep

into its chest but does not slow the momentum of the heavy
beast

DLeh scrambles over some low rocks and dives between two of
them

The BULL CRASHES DOWN on top of the two rocks and on D’Leh
who lies between them There is a strange rush of air then
SILENCE

TicTic stands on the hilltop watching astonished He sees
the other hunters run in getting to the collapsed animal

Moha and LuKibu are the first to arrive There is no sign of
life They cautiously walk around the giant animal

They hear a strange MOANING Moha discovers a bloody hand
sticking out from under the mammoth He and LuKibu grab it
and pull out DLeh

DLeh is dazed Other hunters run in YELLING madly
celebrating the kill They surround DLeh jostling him in
congratulations

Baku comes running He stops and looks at DLeh with awed
respect

BAKU
You killed a Mannak alone

DLeh looks at the massive animal It’s still sinking in

BAKU (CONTD)
No one has ever done that

DLeh looks up to TicTic who still stands on his ridge
watching

Karen observes the scene wordlessly in silent anguish Then
Ka’ren draws his knife steps over to the mammoth and slices
into the neck of the animal He catches the still warm blood
in his small wooden bowl Then he stands and presents it
silently to DLeh

DLeh stares into the bowl for a moment He looks again up to
TicTic But TicTic is gone

Then he drinks down the bowl in one gulp and smiles
exultantly with teeth red from the mammoth’s blood
EXT GRASSLAND - LATER

DLeh and Baku carry one of the mammoth’s tusks back toward
the village DLeh has regained his composure

BAKU
One day I will carry the White
Spear

DLEH

I am sure you will

BAKU
And with it I will choose my own
woman instead of having Old Mother
choose one for me She would give
me an ugly one

DLeh has to smile at the boy

EXT CAMP OF THE MAMMOTH HUNTERS - AFTERNOON

Evolet stares at the hillside with great anticipation Her
fingers nervously play with the necklace DLeh gave her She
sees two figures appear but can’t make out who they are

The other members of the tribe including Old Mother step
up looking with her

Then they can see that it’s DLeh and that he’s carrying a
mammoth tusk Evolet starts running towards D’Leh and Baku

The other tribe members exchange looks of surprise which
turns quickly into joy at the killing of a mammoth They race
after Evolet

Old Mother hangs back watching thoughtfully knowingly
troubled She sees Evolet and the rest of the tribe surround
DLeh celebrating escorting him toward the village

EXT MOUNTAIN PASS - DUSK

High in the mountains Patches of snow glow in the fading
light A white mountain antelope is grazing peacefully

Suddenly we hear a sharp SWOOSH and we see the animal
falling an arrow having pierced its neck The snow slowly
turns red

EXT CAMP OF THE MAMMOTH HUNTERS - DUSK

Old Mother sits alone on a rock outside the mammoth hunter’s
camp The SOUNDS OF CELEBRATION are heard from the village

We CLOSE in on her stoic face as she’s staring towards the
mountains with her eyes wide open when we see--

A trickle of blood starts to run from her nose

TIC’TIC (0S)
Your dream is coming true

Old Mother doesn’t turn around She nods We don’t know if
he’s seen the blood on her face

OLD MOTHER
I know
(beat)
It should have been Ka’ren

TIC’TIC
The Ancient Fathers have spoken

Neither one of them is happy about it They hear the SOUNDS
OF CELEBRATION increasing

EXT CAMP OF THE MAMMOTH HUNTERS - DUSK

The tribe celebrates Massive slabs of meat roast over the
fire Women and children work happily stripping thin pieces
of mammoth flesh putting them on drying racks that surround
the fires

A fermented brew is handed out Many of the men are drunk
especially the hunters

DLeh sits in the middle of the celebration with Evolet at
his side She’s overjoyed

DLeh takes a drink then he sees in the distance TicTic
standing on the ridge near his hut watching Evolet
notices

EVOLET
Why does Tic’Tic not celebrate with
us

DLeh looks at TicTic The solitary distant figure makes
DLeh uncomfortable He takes a drink and tries to shake off
his uneasiness

D’ LEH
Do not think of Tic’Tic

She laughs forgetting TicTic and hugs D’Leh who sees
TicTic turn his back on the celebration and enter his hut

NEARBY Baku regales some of the younger children with the
tale of DLeh’s bravery

BAKU
-and then one after another
they all let go of the net and
only D’Leh held on

Evolet hears and tightens her hold on D’Leh’s arm DLeh has
another moment of discomfort as he listens to Baku’s tale

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GATHERING

Karen sits drinking watching Moha and LuKibu sit down
next to him They’re drunk Together they watch DLeh

LU’ KIBU
Look at him he nearly drove the
Mannaks away from the nets He
thinks of none but himself

MOHA
It’s his blood The father abandons
us and the son risks the hunt for
a kill of his own

LU’ KIBU
It should have been one of us

Karen turns and looks at LuKibu coldly LuKibu backs down

LUKIBU (CONTD)
It should have been Ka’ren

Moha and LuKibu wait for Karen to agree Instead Karen
snaps at them speaking quietly but harshly

KA’ REN
He has proven himself as none of us
ever will

LuKibu and Moha retreat seeing that Karen is not angry at
DLeh but at himself and his fate

KA’REN (CONTD)
Do not speak against him again

Karen takes the bowl of brew from Moha and drinks it down
Then he takes LuKibu’s bowl stands and walks off into the
darkness unsteadily to drink alone

AT THE CENTER OF THE GATHERING
Old Mother steps into the light of the fire

DLeh shares a look with Evolet then he rises and walks over
to Old Mother

D’LEH
Old Mother today I killed a
Mannak

(MORE)

DLEH (CONTD)
I drove the final blow piercing
his heart I claim the White
Spear
Old Mother looks at him closely
DLEH (CONTD)
And with the White Spear I will
claim Evolet as my woman

A moment Old Mother hesitates not pleased

She steps over to the White Spear pulls it from the ground
and hands it to DLeh

She does this in a way that the whole tribe realizes that
Old Mother is not pleased with the outcome of the hunt

DLeh takes the spear and endures the muted congratulations
of the tribe

But his eyes are on Old Mother who walks away and sits down
in the shadows by her hut

A BOWL
Is filled and raised shakily to a mouth--

CUT TO

EXT CAMP OF THE MAMMOTH HUNTERS - LATER

Evolet sits beside D’LEH and has to watch how DLeh gets more
and more drunk She instinctively feels there is something
wrong with him

EVOLET
Don’t have too much

D’LEH
Why not We have to celebrate

He takes another deep gulp

EVOLET
D’leh what is wrong

D’ LEH
(angry)
Nothing is wrong

He immediately regrets the aggressive tone of his voice But
it is already too late

EVOLET
Then why do you sound so angry

He doesn’t know how to answer He gets up takes his White
Spear and walks away Worried and confused Evolet looks
after him

EXT GRASSLAND - NIGHT

D’Leh walks away from the encampment He stops and looks
back toward the glow of the fire Alone and feeling it he
looks up at the stars -- the Big Dipper the North Star

A moment Then he turns and heads toward the ridge on which
we can see TicTic’s hut separate from the others

INT TICTIC’S HUT - NIGHT

Moonlight passes through the gaps of the hut and makes jagged
patterns on the walls and the floor TicTic is sitting at
the rear of the hut

He hears footsteps DLeh enters his hut carrying the White
Spear TicTic waits for him to speak

D’LEH
I did not drive the spear into the
heart of the Mannak

TIC’TIC
I know The Ancient Fathers
played with us today

(beat)
Why are you here

TicTic looks at DLeh closely DLeh looks at the White
Spear

D’LEH
It matters to me what you think

TIC’TIC
It matters more what you think

D’ LEH
When my father left no one looked
at me the same no one treated me
the same no one trusted me No
one but you

TIC’TIC
Your father was impatient like
you

D’LEH
And he betrayed our people by
leaving

TIC’TIC
And you Would you betray our
people

D’LEH
Never

TicTic waits
DLEH (CONT’D)
If I give up the White Spear I
give up Evolet How can I do that
She is everything to me
TicTic considers that
TIC’TIC
And have you earned her Have you
made yourself worthy of her

A long moment Then DLeh holds the White Spear out to
TicTic

D’ LEH
Here Take it back

TicTic takes the spear

DLEH (CONTD)
-until I have earned it

D’Leh turns and walks out TicTic guardedly pleased
watches him go
EXT DLEH’S ROCK - NIGHT

DLeh walks up to a rock and sits down next to it The rock
is covered with paintings of animals and human figures

There are also the silhouettes of two hands a bigger one and
a smaller one at its side

DLeh stares at the smaller hand for a moment then he puts
his hand over it

D’ LEH
(whispering)
Evolet--

CUT TO

EXT HIGH PLATEAU - NIGHT

Thick fog drifts Vultures tear at the carcass of the
slaughtered mammoth

At a SOUND the vultures startle and pull away from their
meal Sensing danger they fly off CAMERA follows their
flight coming to an extreme CLOSE UP of a dark grim-looking
WARRIOR his black eyes scanning the horizon in the
direction of the mammoth hunters’ camp

CUT TO

EXT D’LEH’S ROCK - NIGHT

DLeh sits alone looking out at the night sky He turns at a
SOUND and sees Evolet

Evolet walks up to him

EVOLET
What is it

He doesn’t answer

EVOLET (CONTD)
There is something wrong D’Leh I
feel it

D’LEH
I have given the White Spear back
to Tic’Tic

EVOLET
What

D’ LEH
I cannot claim you as mine

EVOLET
Why would you do such a thing

D’ LEH
I did not kill the Mannak

EVOLET
Of course you did You held onto
the net you killed it alone

D’LEH
My hand was caught in the net I
tried to let go and the Mannak ran
into my spear I did nothing

She starts to cry

EVOLET
You gave away the White Spear you
gave away me

He reaches out to touch her She tries to pull away but he
holds her

D’LEH
I cannot carry the White Spear
unless I earn it and I cannot have
you unless I am worthy

EVOLET
We should be one together

D’ LEH
We will be When it is right

She tries to understand but she can’t She cries D’Leh
looks to the starry sky

DLEH (CONTD)
Do you see that light That one

He points at the NORTH STAR She looks through her tears

D’LEH (CONTD)
It doesn’t move across the sky like
all the others do It stays there
All the other lights go behind the
mountains But not that one It
is always in the same place

EVOLET
How do you know

D’LEH
Because I’ve watched it-- many
times
(beat)
That light is-- like me

She doesn’t quite understand what he means DLeh stands up
and looks at her with sad eyes

D’LEH (CONTD)
It will always be there Evolet--

She turns to him

EVOLET
And yet you gave me up

D’LEH
I gave you up because of what I
feel

She looks at him with sad eyes then she turns and leaves
For a moment we think that DLeh will stop her but he lets
her go--

EXT CAMP OF THE MAMMOTH HUNTERS - DAWN

Everyone except Old Mother is asleep She sits beside what
remains of the fire She takes a last sip from her bowl then
gets to her feet and heads for her hut swaying a bit
INTEXT OLD MOTHER’S HUT - DAWN

Old Mother enters her hut She looks at the beds in front of
her -- Baku his mother and an empty bed

She hears a SOUND steps out of her hut and sees something
very strange something she has seen in a dream A shape
appears out of the fog She sinks to her knees and starts to
chant

Other members of the tribe startle awake Stare in disbelief
ats

A DEMON

To us it is a man on horseback but to these people it is
something the likes of which they have never seen It wears a
strange mask to terrifying effect and its coverings seem to
meld into the horse’s body making them one

This is the WARLORD of the Slave Raiders

Next to him more horsemen appear out of the fog Dark-
skinned men riding on black horses

They are the Slave Raiders

To the tribe they are a vision out of their most fevered
nightmares

Moha wakes He grabs his spear As he jumps up a HARD BLOW
from the butt end of the Warlord’s spear drops him

LuKibu is the next to go for his spear but he is hit
savagely before he can reach his weapon A net is thrown over
him

INSIDE OLD MOTHERS HUT

Baku’S MOTHER wakes She looks outside and sees what is
happening She ducks back in and pushes Baku under a stack
of animal skins

BAKU’S MOTHER
Do not breathe

He is in darkness for a moment then he looks out and sees
his mother a strained look on her face

Baku watches in disbelief as she gasps and slowly slides to
the ground blood trickling down her neck

Behind her he sees a gruesome-looking man with a face
disfigured by scars He is ONE-EYE the Warlord’s second in
command

Baku ducks back under the skins and watches through a tiny
gap Trembling with fear he sees One-Eye search the hut by
torch light One-Eye comes within inches of Baku’s hiding
place then he turns and leaves throwing his burning torch
back into the hut as he goes

Baku stares at the fire for a few long seconds transfixed by
the terror of the moment Then in a sudden move he grabs
one of the animal skins and throws it over the torch trying
to suffocate the flames

CUT TO

EXT HILL SIDE PATH - DAWN

Evolet walks slowly away from D’Leh’s rock toward the
village She hears SCREAMING She runs to a ridge

Evolet’s face freezes in horror She sees the mammoth
hunter’s camp in flames She starts to run toward the camp

CUT TO

EXT CLIFF - DAWN

DLeh hears the NOISES OF THE ATTACK He’s much further from
the camp than Evolet was He steps to the edge of a cliff
and looks in the direction of the camp

He sees the glimmer of fire in the fog He races down the
hill

EXT CAMP OF THE MAMMOTH HUNTERS - DAWN

Evolet runs into the camp She sees that the slave raiders
have already herded up about a dozen and a half young men and
women

The slave raiders are binding the captives tying them
together in pairs with yokes fashioned out of lashed-
together wooden staffs The pairs of captives are then roped
in a line to the raiders’ horses

Evolet can’t believe what she’s seeing Trying to stay out of
sight behind the burning huts Evolet runs toward her
mother’s blazing hut

THE WARLORD SEES EVOLET

She stares up at this apparition in horror as he gallops
toward her

Old Mother throws herself between Evolet and the Warlord

OLD MOTHER
Please Spare her great demon--

With a grimace the Warlord brutally kicks Old Mother in the
face and the old woman drops to the ground

CUT TO

EXT PATH TO THE CAMP OF THE MAMMOTH HUNTERS - DAWN

DLeh rushes downhill He is now closer to the violence and
sees the first burning hut

EXT CAMP OF THE MAMMOTH HUNTERS - DAWN

DLeh approaches the perimeter of the camp and sees the
burning huts dead bodies and the slave raiders starting to
move out their roped captives stumbling behind the raiders’
horses

DLeh doesn’t even slow down He pulls out his stone hand
blade and as he passes one of outlying huts he grabs a
spear from the side of a dead hunter lying on the ground

Then suddenly just before DLeh reaches the main camp he
is TACKLED and brought to the ground

He raises his blade about to kill his attacker then stops
as he realizes that it’s TicTic who speaks to D’Leh ina
sharp whisper

TICTIC
Stay down

D’Leh will have none of that He struggles to free himself
from TicTic but the old man is surprisingly fast and
surprisingly strong

TicTic gets his hands around D’Leh’s throat holding him
down and keeping him from making any loud noises

TIC’TIC
Quiet We can’t help themnot
now

D’Leh sees Evolet among those being led off TicTic tightens
his grip on D’Leh

TIC’TIC (CONT’D)
Not now Not now

In utter agony DLeh watches as the captives are led off
THE WAR PARTY

The Warlord rides at the head of his raiders He looks back
at the captives satisfied

As the Warlord scans the prisoners he notices Evolet
looking back in anguish at the burning huts of the village

She sees the Warlord looking at her and glares at him
furiously The Warlord smiles -- she is beautiful in her
fury perhaps because of it

The Warlord kicks his horse and they ride on The captives
hurrying stumbling pulled along by their ropes

IN THE VILLAGE

As the War Party and captives disappear into the jagged rocks
at the base of the Great Mountains the survivors of the raid
gather children old men old women a few young women who
were able to get away The slave raiders took only the able-
bodied

DLeh and TicTic walk into the encampment They see Baku
crying kneeling next to his mother’s body TicTic gently
lifts the boy to his feet

TICTIC (CONTD)
Go find any that were not taken

All that matters to Baku is his mother lying on the ground

TIC’TIC (CONTD)
Go There is nothing you can do
for her now

Baku’s tears slow a bit He looks out into the grasslands
Knowing every hiding place he heads out

EXT PATH TO THE MOUNTAINS - DAWN

The Warlord leads the Slave Raiders up into the mountains
Evolet and the other prisoners stumble over the rocks trying
to keep up with the horses

Evolet looks back towards the camp and sees small figures
one of whom she can just barely make out as DLeh She reels
then her view of D’Leh is interrupted by a rock outcropping
and she’s dragged on with the other prisoners

EXT GRASSLAND - DAWN

Ka’ren lies in the tall grass At first it appears that he’s
dead then we see the empty bowls of brew around him and we
realize that he is sleeping drunk from the night before
Baku still weeping finds him and rouses him

EXT CAMP OF THE MAMMOTH HUNTERS - DAY

The women of the tribe are laying out the bodies of the dead
giving voice to their sorrow - a high pitched WAILING Others
sprinkle ash over their bodies and faces Old Mother CHANTS
her voice guttural haunting Above vultures circle

Karen and Baku enter the village Karen goes up to Old
Mother and speaks shamefully

KA’ REN
Forgive me Old Mother for not
being here

OLD MOTHER
There was nothing you could have
done

They hear a sound turn and see DLeh grabbing weapons
clothing spare flints and other supplies from the charred
remains of his hut

BAKU
D’Leh

DLeh doesn’t answer as he packs weapons and supplies

KA’ REN
What are you doing

D’ LEH
I’m going after Evolet

BAKU
Over the great Mountains

KA’ REN
It is not possible

D’LEH
They came over the Great Mountains
did they not

KA’ REN
They are demons four-legged
demons Old Mother said so
Perhaps they flew over the
mountains

D’ LEH
I did not see wings on them

KA’ REN
They are many and you are all
alone

TICTIC (0S)
No he is not alone

Everyone turns and sees TicTic fully packed the White
Spear in his hand

TICTIC (CONTD)
I am going with him

Everybody stares at him

TIC’TIC (CONTD)
Without the other hunters our
people will not survive There is
no choice We must free our
brothers and sisters

Old Mother steps up

OLD MOTHER
What Tic’Tic says is true

The entire tribe what is left of it realizes the
seriousness of the situation

Little Baku steps forward

BAKU
I will go too

OLD MOTHER
No Baku you have not lived enough
years

BAKU
(protesting)
But I have to

Old Mother gives him a sharp look

OLD MOTHER
You will stay here
(turning to Karen)
But you Ka’ren will go with them

Karen doesn’t dare to contradict her he runs to get his
things--

DLeh and TicTic exchange a look

EXT EDGE OF CAMP - DAY

DLeh TicTic and Karen finish strapping on their packs
and gather up their weapons -- spears and knives TicTic
carries the White Spear

Old Mother CHANTS the same blessing she gave before the
Mammoth hunt She steps in front of DLeh GATHERING HER
SALIVA

D’ LEH
Do not bless us as hunters We are
hunters no longer Bless us
instead as warriors

Old Mother nods She starts MURMURING A DIFFERENT CHANT one
that is lower more guttural forbidding

DLeh TicTic and Karen move out Behind them those who
remain watch them go Baku steps to the front of the group
Old Mother steps up next to the boy puts her hand on his
shoulder and watches with him

EXT MOUNTAINS EAST FACE - DAY

The Slave Raiders and their captives climb up steep broken
ground ascending in switchbacks The captives struggle to
keep up their wrists and necks bloodied by the ropes and
yokes that bind them The Warlord stops and drinks from his
water bag

Moha and LuKibu are yoked together Moha injured in the
attack stumbles and falls to his knees One-Eye rides over
and whips him YELLING at him to get up

Evolet steps between One-Eye and Moha

EVOLET
Stop Please

One-Eye raises his whip about to swing it Evolet winces
waiting for the blow but standing her ground

The Warlord blocks the lash of the whip He BARKS something
to One-Eye in their guttural language One-Eye lowers his
arm resentfully

The Warlord looks at Evolet who coldly holds his look He
tosses her his water bag She drinks The Warlord holds out
his hand for her to give it back to him

Instead Evolet gives the water bag to Moha and LuKibu Then
she turns to the Warlord and waits for her punishment

For a tense moment the Warlord looks at her Then he smiles
and turns and speaks to one of his men

The slave raider laughs lightly The Warlord kicks his horse
and takes his place at the head of the War Party

EXT MOUNTAINS EAST FACE - SUNSET

TicTic and Karen walk up the broken flanks of the mountain
DLeh is walking ahead of them

The sun has passed behind the mountains and it is getting
harder and harder for them to see their footing on the
treacherous rocks
TicTic stops

TIC’TIC
We stop here for the night

D’ LEH
No we go on we are getting
closer

TIC’TIC
If we find them we will be tired
and hungry
(decisive)
We eat and we sleep here Be
patient

D’ LEH
How can I be patient

TIC’TIC
If they were going to kill them
they would be dead already

KA’ REN
And if they are going to do other
things
DLeh feels a wave of anguish
TicTic touches him sympathetically
TIC’TIC
Well pick up their trail at first
light
EXT MOUNTAINS BOULDER - NIGHT (LATER)

The hunters have eaten They settle down to sleep
next to DLeh speaking quietly to him

KA’ REN
You do not carry the White Spear
TicTic does

DLeh turns away

KAREN (CONT’D)
Why

TIC’TIC
Ka’ren go to sleep

Karen

Karen looks over to TicTic who hasn’t even opened his
eyes Karen turns over and tries to get to sleep

For a long moment we hear only the whistling sound of the
WIND blowing down the mountain

D’LEH
I do not think they are demons

D’Leh stares up at the stars

DLEH (CONT’D)
They are mensitting on animals
Any of us could do that

KA’ REN
Any of us

TIC’TIC
(again without opening his
eyes)
Sleep both of you

EXT MOUNTAIN HIGH PASS - NIGHT

The Slave Raiders have finished eating and are settling down
to sleep Evolet sits among the captives She touches her
wrists We see the dried blood on her wounds left by the
coarse ropes She turns and sees One-Eye staring at her with
malevolent desire

The Warlord sees One-Eye looking at Evolet He walks over and
puts himself between the two of them looking down at One-Eye
with cool authority

The Warlord waits as if challenging One-Eye One-Eye is
almost up to it but not quite One-Eye nods deferentially to
the Warlord and backs off

The Warlord turns to Evolet and says something to her as
gently as he can in his coarse language Then he walks away

Evolet exchanges a look with Moha Neither one knows what the
Warlord just said but they can imagine

EXT MOUNTAINS SCREE FIELD - PRE-DAWN

The mammoth hunters are still asleep as the sky turns a pale

blue TicTic opens his eyes and finds himself staring at
Baku sleeping next to him TicTic jumps to his feet

TIC’TIC
Baku

He grabs the boy and pulls him to his feet

TICTIC (CONTD)
Go back to Old Mother

BAKU
I can help you I can carry your
pack

Baku picks up TicTic’s pack TicTic grabs it from him

TIC’TIC
You will slow us down Go home

Baku turns to DLeh who gives the boy a little shrug -- not
my decision sorry Baku’s shoulders slump as he watches the
men gather up their weapons and packs and move out

EXT MOUNTAIN HIGH PASS - DAWN

The Warlord mounts his horse and shouts commands to his men
who finish tying the prisoner to the horses and mount up

Evolet makes sure that no one is watching then she yanks a
BEAD from the necklace DLeh gave her As they move out she
DROPS it on the ground where it lands on a grey stone

EXT MOUNTAINS EVEN HIGHER - DAY

The mammoth hunters follow the path of the Slave Raiders
their eyes noting everything about the trail -- scraped
stones broken stems of mountain grass drops of blood

A flash of movement behind them Baku is still following
DLeh spots him smiles surreptitiously and says nothing to
TicTic

EXT MOUNTAIN EAST FACE - DAY
TicTic scans the steep and rocky slope above them The ghost

of a smile crosses his lips as his eyes track the switchbacks
taken by the slave raiders

TIC’TIC
Two legs may go where four cannot
(to DLeh)

The hunter gains on the hunted

TicTic starts straight up the slope

D’ LEH
And Baku

TicTic turns questioningly DLeh nods to a rock about
twenty meters away where Baku is hiding not very well

TIC’TIC
Baku I told you to go home

BAKU
Evolet is my blood she is all that
I have left

DLeh nods to TicTic who shakes his head

TIC’TIC
He is not strong enough Go home

TicTic starts to climb DLeh silently motions to the boy --
let’s go

EXT MOUNTAIN CLIFF - DAY

Up the steep slope TicTic climbs steadily and deliberately
DLeh and Karen follow TicTic glares as they see Baku
scrambling up the broken face like a mountain goat easily
passing them

As Baku reaches an outcropping several meters above TicTic
his foot DISLODGES A ROCK which CAREENS down the slope just

missing TicTic’s head

Baku cringes as TicTic looks up at him angrily

EXT TOP OF THE CLIFF - DAY

Baku stands on top of the cliff and looks over the edge
seeing TicTic just below struggling

BAKU
There’s a foothold right there

TicTic ignores him gets one hand on the edge and starts to
pull himself up

Baku leans forward to help and as he does so Baku’s water
bag tips and pours its contents onto TicTic’s head

TicTic waits for the drenching to finish then gives Baku an
endless look The old man then pulls himself onto the top of
the cliff

Tic’Tic walks towards him and Baku cowers closing his eyes
expecting a beating Instead

TIC’TIC
You may come with us on one
condition

Baku gives him a disbelieving look

TIC’TIC (CONTD)
Stop helping me

DLeh hears and smiles slightly as we see the first SNOW
FLAKES drift past his face

EXT MOUNTAIN HIGH PASS - DAY

It is snowing harder now The flakes are bigger and begin to

stick The mammoth hunters arrive at the pass where the Slave
Raiders spent the night DLeh touches the fire pit

D’ LEH
The fire still lives in these
stones

BAKU (0S)
DLeh

Baku points at the bead Evolet dropped DLeh picks it up

D’ LEH
Evolet’s

BAKU
For us to track her

TicTic DLeh and Karen exchange looks and smile at
Baku’s comment

KA’ REN
She didn’t leave that to help us
track her

DLeh grips the tiny piece of ivory tightly in his hand
D’ LEH

She left it to tell me she is still
alive

The snow falls more heavily

They move out As they go they reach into their packs and
pull out skins and furs which they wrap around themselves

CUT TO

EXT MOUNTAINS - DAY

The hunters four tiny specs trek across an endless snow
field dwarfed by the majestic crests looming over them

The hunters pass the massive walls of a glacier

CUT TO

EXT HIGH VALLEY - DAY

Fog hangs low on a high valley that takes them down from the
mountains

Suddenly they see huge skeletons appear out of the fog The
further they walk the more skeletons they see

As the fog clears the mammoth hunters stop in their tracks
and stare at

Skeletons of mammoths as far as their eyes can see
Baku has spotted something

BAKU
Look

He points at a small herd of mammoths resting between
patches of dirty snow

But something is wrong

Some of the mammoths are lying on the ground emitting
strange moans while other mammoths stand close together
over them

BAKU (CONTD)
What is wrong with the Mannak

TIC’TIC
He is tired and laying down to
rest He is dying

EXT ICE FALL - NIGHT

The hunters camp huddled together within the confines of a
hastily built snow structure that shields them from the
biting wind

EXT MOUNTAIN CLIFFS - DAY

They walk downhill DLeh in the lead the others strung out
behind him DLeh raises his eyes and looks at something on
one of the cliffs above HE SEES

A MAN MADE STRUCTURE A long abandoned stone building
constructed in front of a cave dwelling with carvings around
the cave opening It’s a striking-looking structure Ancient
Mysterious Perhaps a hundred years old perhaps a thousand

None of the hunters has ever seen anything like it But
exhausted by their trek they trudge on past even as they
stare at it in astonishment

EXT LOWER ALTITUDE SNOW FIELD - DAY

DLeh and TicTic kneel before a swath of human and horse
tracks in the snow

TicTic checks the crystals formed on the inside of one of
the tracks rubbing them gently between his thumb and
forefinger D’Leh does the same as Karen scans the horizon

TIC’TIC
Less than a day

DLeh and Karen nod in agreement They move on

EXT MOUNTAIN DOWNSLOPE - DAY

The hunters walk downhill The snow cover is thinner with
patches of grass amid the ice

The grass grows thicker as the hunters enter a narrow valley
which leads down out of the mountains

EXT MOUNTAIN WEST FACE - DAY

The hunters climb down a steep field of broken rocks beside a
raging river choked with snow melt DLeh steps to the edge
of a sheer cliff face near a waterfall that drops to the
valley below

A river snakes through the center of the valley On either
side of the river thick tall reeds And further out from
the reeds fern meadows giving way to thick jungle

On the valley floor D’Leh can just make out the tiny figures
of people some on foot some on horseback DLeh motions to
the other hunters then points

D’ LEH
There

They exchange looks then move on

EXT LOST VALLEY EDGE OF THE REEDS - DAY

Enormous dragonflies dodge around the reeds that grow eight
feet tall

The War Party approaches the reeds The Warlord signals stop
The slave raiders and their captives all stop

The Warlord looks out uneasily into the reeds The height and
thickness of the reeds prevents him from seeing very far and
he clearly is concerned about proceeding

No other alternative He barks an order to his men who
tighten up their ranks and become more wary They push
forward into the reeds

Evolet Moha and LuKibu walk with the other prisoners
their progress through the high thick reeds made very
difficult by their yokes

The Warlord is riding next to her He stares at her

LU’ KIBU
I think he wants to claim you

Evolet shudders repulsed by the idea

EXT LOST VALLEY DEEP IN THE REEDS - DAY
The War Party moves through the reeds

POV SOMETHING MOVING stalking tracking the slave raiders
and captives

SOMETHING MOVES suddenly through the frame Very quick
barely seen Human Animal

A SOUND causes Moha Lu’Kibu and the other captive hunters
to jerk their heads in the same direction

AT THE BACK OF THE WAR PARTY a wiry slave raider lagging a
bit kicks his horse to catch up

SUDDENLY SOMETHING BIG and very fast seen only fleetingly
streaks past the camera slamming into the trailing slave
raider

TWO SCREAMS ONE ANIMAL the other the DEATH SCREAM of the
slave raider

Everyone turns catching only the barest glimpse of a large
creature just as it reenters the reeds carrying the slave
raider who SCREAMS IN AGONY

The Warlord his spear drawn rides back and reins his horse
to a stop but there’s nothing to fight

He grabs the reins of the terrified riderless horse He
looks at the reeds but they are too thick for him to see
anything

He BARKS A COMMAND to his men They tighten up their ranks
even more and they move on the fear hanging over them

The captives move closer to the heavily armed slave raiders

EXT LOST VALLEY UNDER THE TREES - AFTERNOON

The hunters move through the jungle approaching the reeds
TicTic notices a mark among the tracks He points it out to
DLeh and Karen

A PARTIAL FOOTPRINT not human not horse Large three-toed
clawed

The hunters exchange looks They’ve never seen anything like
it before They move on

EXT LOST VALLEY REEDS - LATE AFTERNOON

The hunters move silently through the reeds Baku walks
point He stops looking at the ground DLeh TicTic and
Karen step up

They look at the ground before them seeing the marks of the
attack on the slave raider -- blood bits of flesh horse and
human tracks and the tracks of whatever killed the slave
raider

DLeh sees some torn cloth He picks it up and rubs it
between his fingers

D’ LEH
Someone was killed herethen
dragged off into the reeds

POV SOMETHING MOVING through the reeds watching stalking
these four humans

THE HUNTERS sense something in the reeds near them They grip
their spears

A SHADOW MOVESthen a QUICK FLURRY OF SHADOWS in the reeds
nearby

Then nothing

BAKU
(whispers )
What is it

TIC’TIC
Whatever killed hereis not just
one they are many

They move on weapons ready carefully scanning the reeds as
they go

EXT LOST VALLEY CAMPSITE OF THE SLAVE RAIDERS - NIGHT

The slave raiders have set up camp at one end of a fern
meadow One side of the meadow is bordered by jungle the
other side is bordered by the reeds Beyond the reeds is the
river

A large campfire The horses and the captives are tied up
near each other on the fringe of the encampment barely
within the light of the campfire

The slave raiders eat As they finish their food they throw
their scraps to the captives

The Warlord eats his eyes on Evolet He sees her pick up and
eat one of the scraps He rises and walks over to her He
SPEAKS to her miming drinking water then shaking his head
It is clear that he’s telling her not to do with his food
what she did with his water She looks at him unblinking

He gives her his piece of meat She immediately tears it into
several pieces and gives them all to other captives Then
she scuffs through the dirt finding the most unappetizing of
the scraps and eats it while glaring at the Warlord

The Warlord stares at her then he grabs some more meat from
a spit and sits down at the fire to eat with his men

EXT LOST VALLEY HUNTERS’ WATCH POST - NIGHT

DLeh TicTic Karen and Baku watch the War Party
encampment from the far side of the fern meadow

D’ LEH
Tonight We must free them
tonight

TIC’TIC

No not here not tonight

D’ LEH
Why wait

TIC’TIC
This is not a good place

D’ LEH
But

TIC’TIC
No Be patient

D’Leh reluctantly nods

EXT LOST VALLEY HUNTERS’ CAMP - NIGHT (LATER)

DLeh Karen and Baku sleep A short distance away on the
edge of the meadow TicTic sits on watch looking down the
length of the meadow at the slave raider’s camp

TicTic rises walks back to DLeh and prods him awake
DLeh rises TicTic gives him the hunting whistle then lies
down and goes immediately to sleep

DLeh walks over to the watch post He sits staring intently
at the glow of the slave raiders’ fire

EXT LOST VALLEY CAMPSITE OF THE SLAVE RAIDERS - NIGHT

Evolet lies among the captives looking out into the
darkness listening to the SOUNDS OF THE NIGHT She closes
her eyes trying to sleep but sleep will not come She looks
up at the NORTH STAR fingering the necklace DLeh gave her

EXT LOST VALLEY HUNTERS’ WATCH POST - NIGHT
DLeh looks at the NORTH STAR Then he looks at the glow of

the fire in the slave raiders’ camp He stands feeling
himself drawn to the slave raiders’ camp toward Evolet

D’Leh looks back at TicTic Karen and Baku and sees that
they’re all asleep He makes his decision

DLeh heads off moving low through the ferns heading toward
the slave raiders’ camp

EXT LOST VALLEY FERN MEADOWN - PRE DAWN

DLeh stealthily approaches the slave raiders’ camp He sees
the sentries who are tired not alert The one sentry near
the captives is sound asleep The fire is lower the captives
are in the shadows

DLeh crawls closer and closer stopping just outside the
light of the fire

He rises slightly and for the first time he sees Evolet
His breath comes hard He decides that it is time

DLeh gently blows TicTic’s HUNTING WHISTLE emitting a
BIRDLIKE TRILL

EXT LOST VALLEY CAMPSITE OF THE SLAVE RAIDERS - PRE DAWN

Evolet’S EYES SNAP OPEN She hears the whistle in the night
and knows exactly what it is She scans the darkness trying
to pinpoint where it’s coming from

DLeh blows the WHISTLE again

Evolet sees the dark figure of DLeh approaching As thrilled
as she is by his attempt to come for her and free her she is
also very nervous that he will be captured

She looks around and discovers about a hundred feet away
two guards with their horses standing post

DLeh has reached her Silently they embrace desperately
They don’t want to let go - until one of the guard’s horses
neighs

DLeh quickly comes back to his senses He cuts Evolet’s
hands free and then they both crawl over to the other
captives

They shake the first two captives awake neither of whom can
believe what is happening DLeh has to signal them to stay
quiet as he starts to work on their wooden yokes

EXT LOST VALLEY EDGE OF THE CAMPSITE - PRE DAWN

Whatever is stalking the campsite has moved closer to the
guards and their horses It keeps hidden in the high ferns

Suddenly one of the horses picks up a scent and spooks - it
WHINNIES and rears up on its hind legs The guard is about to
lose control of the panicked horse In an instant the other
horses start to panic as well

EXT LOST VALLEY CAMPSITE OF THE SLAVE RAIDERS - PRE DAWN

D’LEH who has just started to cut through the thick ropes of
the first two captive’s wooden yokes turns in surprise He
has no idea what is causing the commotion

EXT LOST VALLEY CAMP OF THE MAMMOTH HUNTERS - PRE DAWN

TicTic comes awake with a start He looks around and
realizes immediately that DLeh is gone

EXT LOST VALLEY CAMPSITE OF THE SLAVE RAIDERS - PRE DAWN
The din wakes the Warlord and his men

Just as DLeh finishes cutting them free the two mammoth
hunters start to panic DLeh and Evolet can only watch as
they jump up and run away Immediately DLeh rushes over and
starts working on the ropes of Moha and LuKibu

The Warlord discovers them He SHOUTS orders in all
directions Then he runs to his horse leaps onto it and
tears after them

DLeh cuts the rope he was working on and frees Moha and
LuKibu But Evolet makes him aware that One-Eye is rushing
over to check on the captives

DLeh realizes that it is impossible to free any more of his
people and signals Moha and LuKibu to slip away

EXT LOST VALLEY FERN MEADOW - PRE DAWN

They all try to use the high ferns as cover But when DLeh
turns he realizes that the Warlord and his men have already

captured the other two freed slaves

At this moment One-Eye discovers him He shouts a warning

The Warlord turns his horse and looks in his direction and
the two men’s eyes meet For a split second time stands
still

Then DLeh turns to Evolet Moha and LuKibu and screams as
if his life is in the balance--

D‘LEH
Run

Everybody starts to run and the Warlord orders his men to
follow him as he goes after DLeh and Evolet

One-Eye jumps on a horse

When they have crossed half of the fern meadow DLeh sees
TicTic Karen and Baku up ahead in the shadow of the trees

Even from this distance he can see that TicTic is furious

He starts towards him as the Warlord and his men close in

EXT LOST VALLEY EDGE OF FERN MEADOW - PRE DAWN

D’Leh Evolet Moha and LuKibu reunite with TicTic Then
they all start to run

The trees give them a slight advantage They gain ground -
but then LuKibu stumbles and falls

The Warlord’s men are on him almost immediately

EXT LOST VALLEY SECOND FERN MEADOW - PRE DAWN

Tic’Tic and the others burst out of the trees onto another
fern meadow

In the next moment the Warlord and his men appear behind
them Riding through the ferns they quickly close the gap

TicTic realizes that the reeds to their left are their only
hope

TIC’TIC
This way

Everybody sees him heading for the reeds DLeh Evolet and
the others follow him

When TicTic and Baku reach the reeds they turn and see that
One-Eye has caught up with KA’REN

One-Eye throws a net and catches Karen in full stride The
young hunter goes down The Warlord and his men close in on
LuKibu

DLeh and Evolet stop for a moment only to see first Karen
and then LuKibu get captured

Then they have to run again because the Warlord is coming
for them There is fury in his eyes

DLeh and Evolet make it into the reeds just in time before
the Warlord can catch him
EXT LOST VALLEY REEDS - PRE DAWN

Now united with TicTic and Baku they scramble into the
reeds

The Warlord and his men follow But their horses are too big
and heavy Their hooves sink deep into the ground

With his slim body Baku can move through the reeds faster
than TicTic DLeh and Evolet

But suddenly the boy stops stock still Ahead of him he
makes out an unhuman movement

TicTic appears by his side Sensing the same kind of
movement to the left he spins

When DLeh and Evolet stop next to them we make out
movements everywhere in the reeds But we gets only glimpses
of something big - and fast

Baku clutches DLeh
BAKU
(whispering)

There

DLeh Evolet and TicTic turn Now they can see more of what
is stalking them

We make out huge beaks ugly black bodies with pale feathers
and savagely taloned three-toed feet--

A flock of TERROR BIRDS
One of the most relentless predators of the era Enormous

beaks serve as deadly scythes Unable to fly they pack-hunt
their prey with merciless speed

When DLeh and the others turn to run back they see the
Warlord and his men ride up

But the Warlord also stops in shock his face an expression
of utter disbelief

An OVERHEAD SHOT reveals--

The mammoth hunters and their pursuers alike are surrounded
by more than twenty Terror Birds

Nobody dares to move A deadly moment stills the reeds
Then the first bird attacks
A GIANT BEAK knocks one of the slave raiders off his horse

They all stare in horror as the creature rears its head
WHAM WHAM-- The bloody beak hammers into the helpless slave
raider

DLeh and Evolet are attacked They duck as a BEAK three feet
long slices through the air where their heads were an instant
earlier The reeds behind them are cut in half as if by a
razor

DLeh pulls Evolet backwards Baku stares with an open mouth
The boy is too shocked to move when the bird turns on him

TicTic rushes to his rescue He kills the bird with a mighty
thrust of his spear

DLeh Evolet and Baku look on in horror

TICTIC
Run

They look at him with big eyes TicTic fends off the next
bird

TICTIC
(more urgent)
RUN

D’LEH and Evolet grab Baku and pull him along They dive into
the reeds

TicTic stabs the bird - he doesn’t kill it but buys some
time to run after them

He gets a last glimpse of the Warlord and his men as they
also fight off the vicious attacks of these predators

TicTic runs through the reeds trying to follow DLeh and
Evolet Suddenly he stops in his tracks
A Terror Bird stands in front of him He raises his spear
DLeh has stopped to wait for TicTic He can’t make him out

But then he sees movement in the reeds First one then two
and then a third Terror Bird has discovered them

DLeh Evolet and Baku have no choice but to run

EXT LOST VALLEY EDGE OF REEDS WITH TREE - PRE DAWN

Baku storms out of the reeds He sees a tree ahead He runs
towards it and climbs it as fast as he can

When he looks down he discovers that the three birds have
nearly caught up with DLeh and Evolet

BAKU
(shouting)
EVOLET Here

But they have no time to climb the tree - the birds are too
close They have no other choice than to keep running

Baku watches in panic as DLeh and his sister disappear into
the jungle with two birds on their heels

He hasn’t noticed that the third bird has discovered him

In the next moment a beak rips the base of the branch on
which Baku is standinq

The boy leaps for another branch grabs it and pulls himself
higher But again a beak smashes into it

He has to leap for the next higher one just as the beak
slices through the air beneath his feet

The bird jumps again and again trying to reach him when
finally Baku pulls himself up to safety
EXT LOST VALLEY REEDS - PRE DAWN

TicTic is still battling his bird With a swift move he
buries his spear into the flank of the animal

The bird goes down but is still able to rip his beak into
TIC’TIC’s side The Old Hunter goes down seriously hurt The
world goes silent

The wounded Terror Bird still manages to rise again and
appears above TicTic

Laying on his back with incredible effort he raises his
spear

TicTic stares into the cold and unblinking eyes of the
predator and for a moment--

Time stands still Then--

WHAM TIC’TIC rams his White Spear into the neck of the
Terror Bird

EXT LOST VALLEY GIGANTIC TREE - PRE DAWN

DLeh and Evolet run for their lives They manage to duck
under the root system of one of the gigantic trees

A mistake They are cornered Wherever they turn one of the
birds is slashing at them DLeh tries to stab them with his
spear

The birds get frustrated and start to dig with their claws
The dirt flies

DLeh realizes that they are in a trap He turns to Evolet

D’LEH

I must lead them away
EVOLET

No
D’ LEH

This is the only way
And before she can protest he crawls out from under the
tree’s roots and starts to run The birds pause at the
unexpected move DLeh attracts them with a shout
The birds give chase Evolet sees DLeh and the birds
disappear between the trees

EXT LOST VALLEY REEDS - PRE DAWN

The Slave Raiders are still battling the Terror Birds all
around them The Warlord has to fend them off from all sides

Suddenly one of the birds grabs his horse by the head and it
goes down

In the last moment the Warlord manages to get off the
falling animal But on the ground he has lost the advantage
of height - it is dire

He looks around and sees one of his men fighting nearby
The Warlord makes a gruesome calculating decision He throws
his spear at one of his own men hitting him deep in the

chest

The wounded Raider SCREAMS out at the betrayal as he tumbles
to the ground

All the birds immediately hack into him and the Warlord’s
horse The Warlord grabs the dead raider’s horse and mounts
it

Realizing that the birds are distracted he shouts for his
remaining men to retreat

EXT JUNGLE BAMBOO FOREST - PRE DAWN

DLeh dodges through the trunks of the bamboo heading to
where the bamboo grows thickest

The Terror Bird closest to him slams its beak into a bamboo
trunk just behind him with a hollow BOOMING SOUND DLeh
ducks and squeezes between two trunks in the last moment
The birds following him are too big to fit DLeh squeezes
into a still narrower gap and the birds now CAW in
frustration The plants are too dense for them to follow

When they hear the feeding calls of their fellow birds they
move on

DLeh sees them disappear and slumps against the bamboo
barrier that saved his life panting for breath

EXT LOST VALLEY - GIGANTIC TREE - DAWN

The sky has turned a pale blue Silence

Evolet listens to the now far-off calls of the Terror Birds
She crawls from under the roots and starts to look for DLeh

EXT LOST VALLEY MOUNT WITH TREE - DAWN

Baku cautiously climbs down his tree and takes one fearful
step on the ground Eyes flitting left and right--

A twig breaks with a SNAP Baku spins and sees-- Evolet
Evolet rushes to her brother

EVOLET
Baku You should not be here

BAKU
We came to-- save you--

BUT in the next moment his face goes pale Evolet turns and
sees the Warlord standing there When she looks to run in the
other direction One-Eye appears before them

The Warlord dismounts and walks to Evolet She puts her arm
protectively around Baku The Warlord looks at the boy and
guesses their relationship

The Warlord reaches out and grabs Evolet roughly by a hank
of hair at the back of her head He pulls her face toward
his and raises his fist to beat her

Then he stops
He looks at her closely and lowers his fist He relaxes his

tight grip on her hair but doesn’t remove his hand from her
hair Instead he strokes it once gently

He ASKS HER A QUESTION IN HIS LANGUAGE motioning to the
jungle and the reeds

BAKU (CONTD)
(to Evolet)
He’s asking about D’Leh

The Warlord looks at Baku with surprising tolerance He likes
audacity

The Warlord waits He gets nothing from them He didn’t
really expect to He turns and strides to his horse BARKING
an order to two of his men who quickly bind Evolet and Baku

EXT LOST VALLEY JUNGLE AND GROUP OF TREES - DAWN

DLeh turns He has heard voices he hears the neighing of
horses With a worried face he rushes through the jungle

Hidden he looks through the foliage and spots the Warlord’s
men who are just finished roping Evolet’s and Baku’s hands

The Warlord mounts his own horse and with a last look
around rides off

DLeh watches in pain as Evolet and Baku disappear into the
jungle There is nothing he can do

CUT TO

EXT LOST VALLEY REEDS - SUNRISE

D‘LEH is looking for TicTic Suddenly he hears loud noises
and sees movement in the reeds

The whole flock of Terror Birds are fighting over the remains
of the Warlord’s horse DLeh discovers the body of the slave
raider the Warlord killed

He can’t make it out clearly but sees enough to realize it
is not TicTic’s body and backs away

CUT TO

EXT LOST VALLEY EDGE OF THE REEDS - DAY
DLeh finally discovers TicTic

He has obviously dragged himself to the edge of the reeds but
lays now half covered in water unconscious

DLeh rushes over to him and discovers that he is still
alive But the side of his leg is ripped open and he is
bleeding heavily

DLeh picks him up and carries him out of the reeds

CUT TO

EXT TOP OF BOULDER - SUNSET
The sun is turning red

DLeh has made a stretcher out of bamboo sticks on which he
now drags Tic’Tic barely conscious

We see the lost valley recede in the distance

When DLeh reaches the top of the boulder he sees A SAVANNAH
stretching out endlessly to the horizon in all directions

A few more steps ahead he lays the stretcher with TicTic
down on the ground and catches his breath On instinct he
looks up

DLeh can now see the caravan of the Slave Raiders The
Warlord and his troops are only a few miles ahead of them

CUT TO

EXT SAVANNAH - SUNSET
Evolet is walking at the end of the slave caravan

She turns and looks at the big boulders which separate the
Lost Valley from the savannah

She looks in vain for a sign of DLeh

CUT TO

EXT ON TOP OF BOULDER BY THE POND - DUSK

TicTic lies unconscious next to a small fire DLeh adds
wood to the fire then he takes from the flames a POINTED
STICK its end burning and glowing

DLeh pulls off TicTic’s bandage puts the burning stick on
the wound then firmly shoves it in along the deep gash

TicTic’s flesh HISSES AND BURNS Even unconscious TicTic
writhes and moans with pain

D’Leh holds to the task carefully cauterizing the length of
the open wound

SMASH CUT

EXT ON TOP OF BOULDER BY THE POND - NIGHT
A star filled sky

TicTic twists in his sleep feverish and sweaty DLeh comes
from the pond with a wet piece of leather and wipes the face
of the Old Hunter

D’ LEH
Do not die TicTic please do not
die You said be patient but I
would not listen Please live and
if you do I will listen and I
will learn

DLeh stands and looks down at the nearly unconscious
TicTic

DLEH (CONTD)
First we sleep then we eat eh
-We’ll need food
DLeh looks at the White Spear on the ground next to TicTic
D’Leh pointedly picks up his own more modest spear instead
of the White Spear Then he heads off into the darkness

CUT TO

EXT SAVANNAH - NIGHT

DLeh is stalking a herd of ANTELOPE The moonlight shows us
their sand-hued backs and long and twisted horns

He creeps closer to them with his spear ready Fifty feet
Forty Thirty Twenty Finally DLeh hurls the spear--

It hits one of the animals and it falls to the ground dead

D’Leh can’t believe his success He hurries over to the
fallen antelope to pull out the spear

A LOUD AND ANGRY GRUNT He looks up and sees--
A BLACK RHINO seven feet tall at the shoulder five tons of
armored muscle It blinks at him and lets out an ANGRY

ROARING HISS DLeh is paralyzed

Slowly he begins to back away He manages to retreat a
couple of steps But then--

The rhino CHARGES at him in a fury

He turns and runs as fast as he can with the rhino barreling
after him DLeh tries to find refuge in the thicket He rips
his side as he runs between two thorny bushes

At full speed he dives under a fallen tree But the raging
rhino smashes right through the brittle wood

In a frenzy DLeh changes his direction But only moments
later the rhino is at his heels again

The animal is now so close that its ROARS are deafening
DLeh can sense the POUNDING of its feet right behind him

There is no more room for escape The rhino is upon him

DLeh SCREAMS in horror as he sees its horn aiming for his
legs He jumps to the side when suddenly--

The ground drops out from under him and he plunges out of
sight

INT PIT TRAP - NIGHT

His spear goes flying as he falls--

Into a PIT TRAP

DLeh hits hard scant inches from one of the thick wooden
spikes protruding from the ground They are sharpened to a

needle-point

DLeh is out cold

He doesn’t see the two yellow eyes glowing in the dark

SMASH CUT TO

INT OLD MOTHERS HUT - NIGHT

Old Mother startles awake with a loud scream Again blood
runs from her nose

She is breathing heavily She hears the voices of her people
whom she has awakened with her scream She looks towards the
entrance of her hut

Snow flurries dance in the ice cold wind

From all sides the remaining members of the tribe appear at
the entrance to her hut watching Old Mother with worried

eyes

CUT TO

EXT PIT TRAP - NIGHT
LIGHTNING and THUNDER rages
The first raindrops hit DLeh’s face

DLeh wakes up He licks the rainwater off his dried lips He
looks around disoriented shocked to still be alive

VULTURES are feasting on the body of an antelope dead on a
spike as rain begins to POUR into the pit As the pit is
situated on a slight incline the water rushes in over the
side of the pit as well

In the eerie moonlight he can just make out the dimensions
of the pit-- fifteen feet deep with overhanging walls of
packed earth

His spear gleams in the shadows on the far end of the pit
DLeh gets to his feet and walks between the spikes to
retrieve it

He reaches out to grab his spear and out of the darkness--

A huge SABER TOOTH TIGER lunges at him Six inch teeth snap
at DLeh The animal lets out a terrifying ROAR

And DLeh jumps backwards and screams

Lightning flashes again and we see the Tiger is STUCK
pinned beneath one of the logs that once covered the trap
Blood trickles from a wound on his side The Tiger struggles
to free itself but its movements are futile

The animal finally lets out a FRUSTRATED and TERRIFYING ROAR
which makes the VULTURES tear into flight in a frenzy

DLeh realizes with concern that the water is rising faster
and faster This is a desperate situation

He decides to try to climb the walls but they are too
slippery from the rain and he falls back into the pit nearly
getting impaled on one of the spikes - again He has now
cheated death a second time in this pit

He slowly gets to his feet and assesses the situation It is
clear that this is a place of death There is no clear way of
scaling the wall - nothing long enough to reach the rim
Until he notices the log which pins down the tiger It’s
broken branches could make for a ladder

The Tiger struggles Unfamiliar territory for the predator

DLeh makes a decision Very carefully he begins to move
towards the Tiger

He looks the Tiger in the eye

D’ LEH
SsshhI understand your anger
brother hunter but I did not make
this trap

The tiger GROWLS RUMBLING glaring at DLeh who continues
to speak very softly

DLEH (CONT’D)
Perhaps we can make a bargain I
need this piece of tree and I will
set you free

The water keeps rising

DLeh reaches the log that has the Tiger pinned The Tiger
struggles more and more with the desperate situation He
watches DLeh who continues coming closer and closer

DLEH (CONTD)
It is not just me brother hunter
There are others If I die here
it is bad for them Better if we
both live

The Tiger does not move DLeh takes another step closer his
heart in his throat

D’LEH (CONTD)
Sssh-- Do not eat me when I set
you free

DLeh touches the log
The Tiger struggles as the water rises DLeh makes his
decision He pushes hard on the log Trying to roll it free

of the Tiger

The animal GROWLS again with its chin dragging in the muddy
water DLeh pushes harder on the log It starts to shift

He strains and pushes with all his might
DLEH
(pushing)
Aaaahhhh
The log pulls free--

And with his last strength the Saber Tooth Tiger comes to
its feet and sends the heavy log flying

The Tiger turns to look DLeh in the eye and ROARS teeth
long as daggers

Then the huge cat leaps over DLeh Its talons carve into the
muddy wall and the Tiger goes up with a burst of speed--

And the Tiger is gone

DLeh doesn’t lose any time He grabs the heavy log and
manages to lean it against the wall of the pit

Then he dives down and after a long moment comes bursting
out of the water again clutching his spear in his hand

Holding it tightly DLeh starts to climb up the log

EXT EDGE OF PIT TRAP - NIGHT

D’LEH’s hand appears and then with one last effort he pulls
himself out of the pit

Then he lays on the rim of the pit for a while panting and
catching his breath

When he looks around he sees the Tiger standing there as if
watching to see if DLeh made it out The Tiger then turns
and disappears

DLeh breathes a sigh of relief

CUT TO

EXT SAVANNAH - DAWN
The night is over and the sky has turned pale again

DLeh is back at the spot where he killed the Antelope But a
flock of Vultures is already feasting on the carcass

CUT TO

EXT ON TOP OF BOULDER BY THE POND - SUNRISE

D’Leh walks back into the campsite where he left TicTic The
fire is out

TicTic is nowhere to be seen
DLeh worried looks around He sees some tracks and follows
them to a lookout point on the ridge where he finds TicTic

looking at something in the distance DLeh is relieved

D’LEH
I feared you were dead

TicTic says nothing

DLEH (CONTD)
Tic’Tic I am sorry

TicTic brushes off the apology with a motion and points in
the distance where columns of dark smoke rise

TicTic gestures to him to stay down DLeh crawls next to
him and looks also over the rim

Far in the distance he sees a village Plumes of dark smoke
rise from the burned huts

DLeh looks puzzled He has never seen such an advanced
settlement

We realize that the settlement is surrounded by green fields

CUT TO

EXT FIELDS NEAR NAKUDU’S VILLAGE - DAY

TicTic and DLeh approach the village D’Leh has to support
TicTic as they walk

Smoke rises No one is visible
The two hunters reach the tilled fields DLeh kneels to run
his hands over the new green shoots of barley poking out of

the ground

Then he discovers one of the WOODEN HOES the villagers have
left behind He picks it up and shows it to TicTic

DLEH
This is not a spear

They look at it then toss it down and move on

EXT NAKUDU’S VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY

Entering the destroyed village very cautiously they come by
a ring of mud-walled huts

DLeh scratches the wall with his fingernail revealing the
brown and porous mud beneath it

DLEH
(surprised)
These stones have a skin around
them

They venture deeper into the village and reach the center
square The doors to the huts stand wide open broken pottery
scattered everywhere but--

No sign of life

They come by a huge earthen pot filled with grain DLeh
smells it He realizes it’s food but it’s not particularly
appetizing

Their hungry eyes spot a bowl of dried meat They hurry over
DLeh lowers TicTic to the ground and they both start
stuffing their mouths eagerly

THEY STOP AT APPROACHING SOUNDS A shadow falls over them

DLeh and Tic’Tic now stare up at a fierce looking warrior--

This is NAKUDU
He is from the tribe of the NAKU

He wears a headdress with two SABRE TEETH hanging down on
each side of his face and his body is painted for war

When TicTic reaches for his spear he is brutally kicked in
the face by Nakudu

As the Old Hunter goes down DLeh jumps to his feet and
steps in front of TicTic to protect him

Nakudu yells an order and a group of fierce looking warriors
appear from behind the destroyed buildings

The Naku Warriors slowly begin to surround DLeh They form a
tighter and tighter circle with their spears pointed at him

With quick moves DLeh turns to all sides holding on
tightly to the White Spear But there is no chance for
escape when suddenly--

DLeh stumbles backwards over the fire pit landing in the
ashes

Nakudu quickly moves in He raises his spear ready to slay
him--

But then Nakudu freezes

He slowly retreats with a look of terror on his face The
Naku Warriors backup

We hear a mighty ROAR

DLeh turns He sees a SABER TOOTH TIGER moving slowly
threateningly into the village square

The Tiger starts at Nakudu and his men They all shy back
startled and scared But then the Tiger turns and advances
towards DLeh

Tic’Tic has regained his bearings He looks on in fear as the
big cat reaches the young hunter

The animal paces around him and then moves over him and
lowers its head

DLeh stares paralyzed at its HUGE SABER TEETH only inches
from his face and discovers the wound in its neck--

THIS IS THE TIGER FROM THE PIT
D’LEH
Brother hunter you must remember

me

To the silent amazement of everyone DLeh talks to the
tiger

DLEH
I set you free-- I am your friend

The tiger looks up at DLeh then turns and for a long
moment stares right at Nakudu and his men

Then the TIGER lets out a GROUND-SHAKING ROAR then turns and
walks away

Everyone watches in awe The Naku Warriors turn to each
other and speak amongst themselves with Nakudu speaking
with the most urgency

Nakudu steps from the group to DLeh

NAKUDU
You speak to the Spear Tooth

DLeh and TicTic exchange a surprised look DLeh turns to
Nakudu

DLEH
How do you come to speak our words

Nakudu turns to his men They are having a heated argument
They chatter all at the same time it seems in their strange
language scattered with many clicks and hisses

DLeh and TicTic exchange looks

After a while the Naku men seem to have come to a conclusion
Nakudu steps up to DLeh and TicTic

NAKUDU
Come

Nakudu and his men stride off DLeh and TicTic have no
other choice but to follow

EXT NAKU BOULDERS - DAY

Towering sandstone monoliths Within sight of the village

D’Leh and TicTic follow the Naku Warriors to the base of the
sandstone monoliths

Nakudu stops and CALLS UP

One by one women and children appear looking over the edge
of the platform

D’Leh and TicTic exchange a look DLeh turns to Nakudu

D’LEH
Is this where your people go when
attacked

Nakudu doesn’t answer His attention is on the platform
where three chairs attached to ropes are let down over the
edge Each chair holds a very old man the tribal WISE MEN

As the old men are gently lowered to the ground more ropes
and rope ladders are dropped and other members of the tribe
climb down

The three old men reach the ground and are helped from their
chairs They speak for a moment with Nakudu and are amazed
at what he tells them

DLEH (CONTD)
What did he say

NAKUDU
You are hungry We will eat

CUT TO

INT COMMUNAL HUT - NAKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

DLeh and TicTic have not eaten a real meal in days They
wolf down the food scarcely pausing to chew

With them on the opposite side of the room sit the Wise
Men Nakudu and his men Several other older men women and
children are crowded in the background watching listening

We notice that the walls of the hut have the pelts of Saber
Tooth Tigers hanging from them-- clearly the animal is much
revered here

DLeh picks up a piece of flat bread He looks at it
curiously then bites in to it

D’ LEH
(to TicTic)
The food is different-- but good

He immediately gets cut off by the Wise Men Nakudu
translates

NAKUDU
Not speak Eat

TicTic looks around and realizes he has to finish eating
before he can ask a question He looks over to DLeh and lets
out a loud BURP Nakudu’s tribe reacts - everybody beats on
the ground with their hands

After that they all stare at D’LEH It is an unusual moment
D’LEH
(whispering to TicTic)

What do they want

NAKUDU
You not like Naku food

It takes DLeh a few moments to understand what they expect
from him He finally swallows and lets out a mighty BELCH

This time the Naku people beat even louder and one of the
Wise Men speaks Nakudu translates

NAKUDU (CONTD)
Now you speak

Tic’Tic clears his throat
TIC’TIC
We came over the mountains We are

looking for our stolen brothers

NAKUDU
We know where you come from

TicTic is stunned DLeh cuts in
D’ LEH

How do you know And how do you
know our words

Nakudu translates to the Wise Men They motion Nakudu to
answer him Nakudu moves closer to DLeh

NAKUDU
A man came from the mountains
before He was looking for the
land with two suns The Wise Men
told me to learn his words

These words have great impact on DLeh and TicTic
NAKUDU (CONTD)
He taught us to build traps to kill
the Spear Tooth our enemy

Nakudu pauses Then he points to DLeh

NAKUDU (CONTD)
You have his face

Amazed DLeh turns to TicTic

D’LEH
He speaks of my father

TicTic nods quietly DLeh turns back to Nakudu

DLEH (CONTD)
(trying to hide the
emotion in his voice)
What happened to him

Nakudu looks back and translates what was said to the Wise
Men

They argue a while under themselves then the oldest of them
speaks to Nakudu who turns to DLeh and TicTic

NAKUDU
The Wise Men of the Naku want you
to come

CUT TO

EXT NAKU CAVES - NIGHT

The three Wise Men Nakudu and the Naku Warriors lead DLeh
and TicTic to the mouth of some caves The scene is lit by
torches

INT NAKU CAVES - NIGHT

The torches move into the caves casting shifting light
Throwing shadows The cave entrance is narrow then opens up
into a large vaulted cavern eerie stunningly beautiful

The walls of the cavern are covered with cave paintings
Hundreds of them depicting hundreds of years of tribal
history dreams and myths

D’LEH
Who made these pictures

NAKUDU
They were here long before our
people came to the Water of Naku

The Wise Men lead the group to one of the faces of the wall
the light of their combined torches illuminating what’s
before them

The oldest of the Wise Men narrates the tale and Nakudu does
a simultaneous translation for DLeh and TicTic

NAKUDU (CONTD)
For as long as we rememberthese
men have come from the sunrise
They take our peopleand not only
our peopleour neighborsAll
have suffered

The old man points to a series of cave paintings images
showing war and raiders on horseback

DLEH
Where do they take them

NAKUDU
Four days walk to the river There
they put them on their big birds
who can fly into the desert

Nakudu points to another painting depicting strange
rectangular birdlike images

DLeh goes ahead He’s seen something else He points at one
of the images showing structures with ramps surrounded by
many human figures

D’ LEH
What is this

Nakudu translates and the WISE MAN answers in a somber tone

NAKUDU
This is where our people die
(pauses)
The mountains the gods buildto
live forever

Again the Wise Man speaks

NAKUDU (CONTD)
The Wise Men says you will lead us
there

DLeh is stunned

D’ LEH
Me

NAKUDU
Yes There is an old telling One
day a man will appear who can talk
to the Spear Tooth a man who will
lead us in war to free our
people

Nakudu walks over to the last painting where we see an army
lead by one single man

NAKUDU (CONTD)
You are that man

This all has a powerful emotional effect on D’Leh

EXT NAKUDU’S VILLAGE - NIGHT (LATER)

The village lies quietly in the darkness by the lake

INT NAKUDU’S VILLAGE HUT - NIGHT

D’Leh watches as one of the Naku women puts salve on
TicTic’s wound then adeptly bandages it with a broad leaf
She quietly exits the hut when she is finished DLeh lies
down near TicTic

TIC’TIC
The Ancient Fathers continue to
play with you

DLeh is too troubled to smile

D’ LEH
What should we do

TIC’TIC
They believe you to be their
leader If it is true so be it

D’LEH
I am no leader of men no mighty
warrior

TIC’TIC

Perhaps you are more than you
think Our people have their own
telling different but not so
different

TicTic pauses for a moment Then he decides to tell DLeh
about their prophecy

TICTIC (CONTD)
The Ancient Fathers told us that a
hunter would arise from the last
great Mannak hunt a warrior who
would lead our people away from our
valley to a land of two suns

This is new to DLeh He looks at TicTic with big eyes

D’ LEH
Do you think that warrior is me

TIC’TIC
I don’t know Your father thought
it might be him That’s why he
left He was searching for the land
of the two suns He wanted to save
our people

DLeh tries to make sense of all this He shakes his head

D’LEH
Why didn’t you tell me Why did you
let me believe all these years that
my father was a coward

TIC’TIC
Old Mother did not want our people
to know that his journey had
failed She thought

DLeh interrupts

D’ LEH
I only want to find Evolet and
bring her home and maybe find my
father if he is still alive

D’Leh sits quietly with this

TIC’TIC
Perhaps the Ancient Fathers have
chosen you to finish what your
father started

Tic’Tic looks closely at DLeh

TIC’TIC (CONTD)

A good man draws a circle around
himself and cares for those within
-- his woman his children Other
men draw a larger circle and bring
within their brothers and
sisters

(beat)
And some men have an even bigger
destiny and feel they must draw a
circle around themselves that
includes many many more

(beat)
Your father was one of those men
You must decide for yourself
whether you are as well

TicTic looks at DLeh then turns over to go to sleep
D’Leh’s mind whirls He lies in the dark staring Another
night in which sleep will not come easily

EXT NAKUDU’S VILLAGE - DAY

The water of the lake reflects the first rays of the sun The
Naku people are gathered NINE NAKU WARRIORS including
Nakudu prepare to leave with DLeh and Tic’Tic

The Naku warriors finish packing then start hitting their
spears against the handles of their knives jumping in
unison Their women and children join them

Then they stop The warriors go to their families for final
good-byes which end with them gently touching their
foreheads together The tenderness within the families is
moving

DLeh and TicTic watch Nakudu say goodbye to his wife She
CRIES as they touch foreheads together Then Nakudu leaves
her joining DLeh and TicTic

D’ LEH
Your woman’s tears show her fear
that you won’t return

NAKUDU
Her tears are for our son who was
taken yesterday

DLeh looks at Nakudu then touches him on the arm firmly
sympathetically TicTic notices the touch Nakudu thanks
DLeh with a nod then motions to his men and they move out
The Naku tribe including the three old men watches them go

CLOSE SHOT Nakudu’s wife weeping

CUT TO

EXT SAVANNAH - DAY

CLOSE SHOT Tudu a boy about Baku’s age weeps CAMERA
PULLS BACK to reveal that

Tudu and Baku are yoked together Tudu is one of a handful
of new dark skinned prisoners who have been added to the
slave raiders’ captives

They trudge through the blazing hot sun across an expansive
savannah Evolet walks near them roped but not yoked to
another prisoner

We see KA’REN who is weighted down by the yoke he carries
alone He steps up to Evolet

KA’ REN
(nodding toward the
Warlord)
LuKibu told me that he would claim

you
She gives him a look

KAREN (CONTD)
We all need water

Evolet looks around The captives all look weak from thirst
their lips dry and blistered

Evolet walks up to the Warlord pointing at her dry lips
bold beyond her situation

The Warlord looks at her fixing on her audacity He throws
her his water bag Before she drinks she points at all the
other prisoners

The Warlord lets out a short exhale He thinks for a moment
then YELLS AN ORDER

A couple of the slave raiders dig into their packs and pull
out sponges onto which they pour water from their skin
canteens

They throw the sponges to the captives who suck from them
greedily One of the slave raiders hands a sponge to Baku
who refuses with a proud look

One-Eye sees and steps up He grabs the sponge and sticks it
in Baku’S face Baku realizes that he is face-to-face with
the man who killed his mother

Baku’s eyes go cold and he SPITS IN One-Fye’S FACE

Enraged One-Eye grabs Baku by the hair and hits his head
against the yoke around his neck again and again

EVOLET
Stop You must stop

Tudu goes to Baku’s defense KICKING One-Eye FURIOUSLY That
angers One-Eye even more and he starts whipping both boys

Karen nearby bravely throws his body at the Slave Raider

One-Eye gets even more furious In his anger he lets go of
the two boys and starts to hit Karen with his whip until he
goes down

The Warlord watches expressionless When One-Eye is finished
with Karen he walks on Baku his face bloodied watches in
cold hatred

CUT TO

EXT SAVANNAH - DAY

Swaying grassland Scattered stands of trees Herds of
grazing animals in the distance Zebra giraffes springboks

TicTic and DLeh kneel looking at the tracks of the War
Party TicTic and DLeh exchange a look Nakudu looks
questioningly at them

TIC’TIC
One day and a night ahead of us

D’Leh looks in the direction of the tracks which head toward
some steep mountains He turns to Nakudu

D’LEH
What is the fastest way through
those mountains

Nakudu points to the mouth of a gorge several kilometers
away They head off in that direction

EXT GORGE - DAY

DLeh TicTic Nakudu and the Naku warriors approach the
mouth of the gorge

Nakudu hisses and raises his hand All stop Nakudu points
into the gorge where they see

A PRIDE OF SABER TOOTH TIGERS A dozen of them males
females young They are laying about being warmed by the
rays of the late day sun

The gorge is narrow and to pass would mean walking very
close to the tigers Two of the big males see the humans
they begin emitting low rumbling GROWLS

Nakudu and his men speak among themselves Then Nakudu speaks
to DLeh

NAKUDU
(matter-of-factly)
To go around would take a day or
more Speak to them Tell them to
let us pass

DLeh stands there with TicTic at his side looking at the
narrow gorge and the tigers

TicTic scans them also

TIC’TIC
I don’t see your friend among them

D’ LEH
Neither do I

TIC’TIC
Perhaps he told them about you

Gallows humor DLeh sighs Nakudu and his men watching
waiting for him to do his thing

D’ LEH
(whispering to TicTic)
They will eat us

DLeh sees some vultures circling over the carcasses of some
antelopes near the tigers

He looks at the vultures then at the tigers noting that two
of them are still eating gnawing on carcasses and two
others have blood on their faces and paws

The Naku Warriors are getting agitated Nakudu demandingly
motions for DLeh to lead the way

TIC’TIC
Make up your mind or they will get
angry--

DLeh bows his head and makes a decision Without looking
back at TicTic or Nakudu--

HE WALKS INTO THE GORGE

The others watch as DLeh walks on a path that takes him
right between the tigers He walks steadily to all
appearances calmly

DLeh’s eyes show a different story He half-expects to be
ripped to pieces at any moment but with his back to the
others he doesn’t show it Nor does he breathe

Soon everybody follows him at a safe distance with TicTic
bringing up the rear of the group

The huge cats lurking in the grass circle the men as they
pass The tension rises even higher as a few of the tigers
creep in close They are now only a few feet away

But DLeh stays the course and continues to lead the men
through the center of the pack Beads of sweat form on his
brow

When they finally reach safe ground he exhales and smiles at
TicTic with great relief Nakudu and his men stare at him in
awe

TicTic steps up next to DLeh and they speak quietly
unheard by the others

TIC’TIC (CONTD)
I hope the Ancient Fathers don’t
tire of their games

D’ LEH
It wasn’t the Ancient Fathers

D’Leh nods toward the vultures circling the antelope carcass
Then he motions to the blood on the tigers’ paws and faces

D’LEH (CONTD)
My friends were simply not hungry

TicTic smiles They start to move out then stop as they
see on a rise ahead of them

WARRIORS A dozen men very threatening looking Armed They
are the men of HODA tribe Tall dark imposing Their leader
is QUINA very formidable

D’Leh and TicTic are not sure if they’re about to do battle
They grip their spears

Nakudu steps forward and speaks to Quina From their
gestures it’s clear that DLeh is their main topic of
conversation

Nakudu rejoins D’Leh and TicTic

NAKUDU
They lost some of their people too
They wish to join us

TIC’TIC
Good

Quina has come over and takes a closer look at DLeh who
looks nervously to Nakudu

D’ LEH
What does he want

NAKUDU
I told them how you spoke to the
Spear Tooth

Quina walks around DLeh slowly carefully studying him Then
he stops with his face only inches away from DLeh’s face
After a long look in DLeh’s eyes Quina takes a step back and
makes a deep bow

Seeing this the Hoda warriors POUND their spears against
their shields and it becomes clear that they are honoring
DLeh

D’LEH exchanges looks with Nakudu and TicTic
The POUNDING of the spears becomes louder and louder

AS WE CUT TO

EXT SAVANNAH - DAY

United with the Hoda Warriors our men march across the
savannah

They approach another village that has been attacked by the
Slave Raiders and are joined by its surviving men
We hear the POUNDING of the spears getting louder

AS WE CUT TO

EXT SAVANNAH HILL - DAY

DLeh TicTic Nakudu and Quina are marching side by side as
their men make their way down a gentle hillside

A different tribe with a strange skin color and even
stranger body markings joins them

They speak with Nakudu excitedly This gets translated to
Nakudu by Quina

The pounding of spears grows into a MASSIVE and THUNDERING
BEAT

SMASH TO

EXT SAVANNAH - BEFORE SUNRISE
Total silence

The sky begins to pale DLeh lies beside a smouldering fire
TicTic shakes him awake

As DLeh gets up he slowly realizes that--

THE ENTIRE FIELD IS NOW FILLED WITH WARRIORS all rising one
by one or in whole groups to get ready and march with him

DLeh stares in wonder There must be hundreds who have come
to join them during the night

He turns to TicTic--

DLEH
I did not know the earth could hold
so many spears

In the next moment a new group of warriors appears By their
demeanor we immediately know that they are bearing bad news

They clearly speak in a tongue different from that of Nakudu
as the whole process takes a lot of time with many people
trying to help with the translation

D’LEH
(impatient)
What are they saying
Finally Nakudu turns to DLeh His face betrays worry
NAKUDU
They come from the river The birds
have arrived

D’ LEH
How far is it to the river

NAKUDU
Not far But we must hurry

DLeh and Tic’Tic exchange a look Nakudu lets out a war cry

NAKUDU (CONTD)
Yahalah

Hundreds of warriors follow his example and raise their
spears and SHOUT in response

Then they start to move

CUT TO

EXT SAND DUNE BY THE RIVER - DAY
They are on the march - at a fast pace

They have entered a dune landscape with big black boulders
and rocks

DLeh starts to enjoy leading his own army With a proud
smile he looks over to TicTic

As they climb the crest of a dune DLeh’s smile fades--

EXT ON TOP OF A SAND DUNE BY THE RIVER - DAY

There are many huge ships made out of reeds with large blood-
red sails But they have all launched some just minutes
earlier

They are sailing away from a loading area which is now
deserted The last ship sailing away catches the wind

DLeh can make out the horses and slaves on the boats

The river snakes its way through sand dunes to the horizon--

CUT TO

EXT SHIP - DAY

The slaves are roped to the reed boat Baku sits next to
Evolet His face is still beaten up With big eyes he looks
around and then up to the huge straining sails

He watches the wind catching them Frightened by what he
sees he turns to his sister

BAKU
(whispers )
Where do they bring us

EVOLET
I don’t know little brother

Her voice belies her brave front She looks over to where the
Warlord sits and realizes that he is watching them with a
bemused smile

CUT TO

EXT ON TOP OF THE SAND DUNE BY THE RIVER - DAY

DLeh looks around He sees the devastated faces of his
warriors

NAKUDU
We came too late The big birds
have flown away

D’Leh and TicTic exchange a look Pause

D’ LEH
We have to follow them

NAKUDU
The river takes them far

DLEH
(stubborn)
Then we will walk farther--

NAKUDU
It has never been done No one has
ever tried to cross the big sea of
sand

DLeh contemplates this
The first of the warriors have already turned to leave

TicTic looks at DLeh who thinks for a moment and then
yells the same battle cry he has heard from Nakudu

D’ LEH
Yahalah

And with this battle cry he starts to march in the direction
the ships are going

For a moment everybody is too stunned to contemplate the
boldness of this move but then TicTic begins to follow
him

Nakudu gathers himself and joins the march One by one and
then group by group the warriors start to march again

When DLeh reaches the first of the sand dunes he turns and
looks back

His pride at the courage of the men behind him - and his
relief - is evident The whole army is on the move again

CUT TO

EXT EDGE OF DESERT - LATER

DLeh’s army marches up a steep mountainous sand dune They
stop at its crest It is obvious that they have been walking
for many days

The warriors are streaked with sweat and dried-on sand and
many have makeshift turbans wrapped around their heads

In front of them stretches a daunting sea of sand It is awe-
inspiring - and endless

The only feature in this barren desert is the blue river
snaking out to the horizon There is no sign of the ships of
the Slave Raiders
TicTic appears next to DLeh He looks worried
TIC’TIC
(whispers )
I do not like what I see

DLeh knows he is right but they have no other choice

D’ LEH
All we can do is follow the river
And with that he walks again

CUT TO

EXT DESERT DEEPER - DAY

The army moves on through the relentless heat The sun fills
the sky Uncovered skin is blistered lips are raw Water is
greedily emptied from skin-canteens

DLeh looks up at the sun

CUT TO

EXT DESERT EVEN DEEPER - DAY

Days later and the army looks even more parched and sun-
blasted than before A strong wind is blowing

Again DLeh leads the men But he too is clearly at the very
limits of his endurance

TicTic sees one of Nakudu’s men collapse DLeh doesn’t even
notice

TicTic angrily catches up to him

TIC’TIC
DLeh We have to rest

DLeh looks at him numb They stare at each other

D’ LEH
No we have to go on--

He starts walking again Now TicTic grabs him by the throat
and pulls him close to his face

TIC’TIC
We have to rest

D’Leh stares at him

CUT TO

EXT RIVER - NIGHT

The ships of the Slave Raiders sail through the calm waters
lit by the full moon The prisoners are all tied together on
deck Everybody is sleeping Except for--

One-Eye When he sees that the Warlord is soundly asleep he
gets up and slowly starts searching the ship

It takes him a while to find what he is looking for When he
sees Evolet sleeping next to Baku and Tudu he crouches

In the next moment One-Eye clasps one hand on Evolet’s mouth
to muffle her and then presses the other between her legs

Evolet struggles to push him away but she is no match for
him

Baku startles awake Before he can scream One-Eye knocks him
out cold

This brings PANIC into Evolet’s eyes But in the next moment--
WHAM

The Warlord rips One-Eye off Evolet He kicks him viciously
first in his face and then between his legs until he goes

unconscious

Trembling Evolet looks up at the Warlord who breathes
heavily

He reaches out wanting to cover up her shoulder when
suddenly his eyes widen

He inches back staring at her naked shoulder

One-Eye regains his senses He looks over and also notices
what the Warlord is staring at A birthmark

When he notices One-Eye the Warlord quickly pulls Evolet’s
clothes back over her shoulder

Evolet gives both men a fearful and puzzled look
CUT TO
A STAR FILLED SKY--

We see the North Star again and the belt of Orion The three
stars have the same configuration as Evolet’s birthmark

EXT DESERT - NIGHT

DLeh is sitting on the crest of a dune Fires are burning in
the BACKGROUND His exhausted men are sleeping

DLeh stares at the beads from Evolet’s necklace in his hand
Then he looks up at the sky and makes out the North Star

Suddenly he jumps to his feet runs down the dune and shakes
TicTic awake

D’ LEH
(excited)
You were right-- We must rest--

A groggy TicTic looks at him like the desert sun has finally
made him crazy

DLEH (CONT’D)
-- During the day and march at
night
TIC’TIC
How will we find our way with the
moon resting under the earth
D’LEH
See that light in the sky
(pointing)
That one--
TicTic looks up

DLEH (CONTD)
It will guide us

CUT TO

EXT DESERT - NIGHT

The army is now marching at night and looks much more
energized

DLeh is taking the lead again Following his star--

CUT TO

EXT DEEPER IN THE DESERT - DAY

The whole army is sleeping during the day

TicTic reclines against his pack the only man awake He
studies D’LEH who is deep asleep

CUT TO

EXT CANYON - SUNSET

The reed boats of the Slave Raiders float through a deep
canyon

Evolet is awakened by a strange noise which reflects off the
stone walls of the canyon

When she looks around she notices that everybody is staring
at something

Her brother’s mouth is agape Evolet follows his look and
discovers--

A gigantic stone quarry in which thousands of workers slave
away They are cutting huge rectangular pieces of stone out
of the mountain

A horrifying and breath-taking image

In the foreground we see the stone blocks being loaded onto
ships

Evolet Karen and Baku look at each other Is this the place
of their enslavement

CUT TO

EXT ENORMOUS SAND DUNES - NIGHT

The army is on their night march again They are now crossing
sand dunes that are three or four hundred feet high

The wind is getting stronger by the minute TicTic walks
next to DLeh They look at each other with worry Up ahead
at the summit of the highest dune the wind kicks up the sand
and starts to blot out the stars

A sandstorm is blasting DLeh’s army They can’t even talk
over the screaming winds DLeh tries to signal everyone to
drop down to the ground He does so himself trying to cover
his body and face TicTic drops next to him

CUT TO

EXT BIG DUNE - MORNING

A gigantic sand dune covered with strange bulges One of the
bulges moves then breaks open as an arm appears

DLeh EMERGES FROM THE SAND
The bulge next to him opens up and TicTic crawls out One

after another the other bulges open and reveal DLeh’s
warriors

DLeh and TicTic HEAR SOMETHINGvoices D’Leh climbs the
steep dune with TicTic following As they reach the crest
they look out astonished unable to believe what they see

AN ENORMOUS CONSTRUCTION SITE

On a scale beyond imagination Two massive buildings one
nearly completed the other half-finished their gigantic
size almost obscuring their simple geometry

They are PYRAMIDS

Thousands of workers cover the flanks of the pyramids and
the surrounding plain Slaves twenty thousand souls toiling
under the brutal sun

Beyond the pyramids on a broad plateau overlooking the Nile
stands a PALACE the only completed building

AN ENORMOUS WOODEN SHIP sticks out of the back of the palace
as if the building has been constructed around it

DLeh and TicTic look at the site trying to comprehend what
they see Nakudu steps up next to them amazed

NAKUDU
The mountains of the gods

D’Leh looks at the enormous number of slaves knowing that
somewhere among all those thousands must be Evolet

EXT NEARLY FINISHED PYRAMID - LATE AFTERNOON

We fly over the enormous construction site toward the
pyramid that is nearly completed In the light of the

afternoon sun we see thousands of slaves working

Teams of men pull massive stone blocks up huge ramps which
are nearly as big as the pyramids themselves

At the top of the pyramid is a smaller pyramid about ten
feet high sheathed in gold This will be the capstone of the
pyramid when it is finished

RAMP NEAR THE TOP

Karen LuKibu and Moha pull ropes part of a gang of two
hundred men pulling a multi-ton cut stone Hard back-
breaking work

LuKibu loses his footing and falls One of the overseers
WHIPS him mercilessly until he gets to his feet and resumes
his place pulling

Baku AND Tudu dump water in front of the stone to lubricate
its movement

Evolet trudges up the ramp in a long line of women who
carry water buckets on yokes

The work crew nears the small golden pyramid Baku running
to refill his bucket pauses for a second to look at it
Mesmerized he reaches out to touch its golden surfacewe
hear a WHIP LASHING

BAKU
Arrgh--

Baku turns in pain and looks into the angry face of a Slave
Guard who continues whipping him mercilessly until
suddenly

A STRANGE HORN SOUNDS

The guard stops whipping Baku and starts yelling at the
slaves who immediately prostrate themselves eyes to the
ground

Baku Tudu Evolet Karen and the other new captives see
what is happening The guards YELL at them and they follow
suit lying down

After all of the slaves lie down the guards lie down as
well As the dust settles an eerie stillness falls over the
entire site

Baku Tudu and Evolet lie near each other Very carefully
they raise their eyes slightly and look over the edge of the
ramp where in the distance they see

THE PALACE

A crowd of bald men of all ages all wearing purple clothes
They are the PRIESTS They converge at the palace steps

The huge stone door of the palace opens and a tall
rectangular box gets carried out It is a GIGANTIC LITTER
carried by a dozen men on either side

A procession forms and heads down the avenue from the palace
to the pyramids The litter is in front with priests and
guards following in file

ON THE PYRAMID CONSTRUCTION RAMP

Everyone lies on the ground all eyes lowered Ka’ren
LuKibu and Moha together

Moha raises his eyes slightly taking a glance seeing the
approach of the procession

MOHA
(whispering)
What do they carry
Karen does not look up He presses his head to the ground

RAMP NEAR THE TOP

Baku Tudu and Evolet lie near each other peeking they see
the litter They whisper

BAKU
They carry a god in that

EVOLET
A god Who told you that

BAKU
Tudu One of the old men told him

EVOLET
You learned Tudu’s words

BAKU
Yes Some

VIEWING PLATFORM

The procession reaches the edge of the construction site The
litter is set down on an elaborate platform

The HIGH PRIEST steps up to the litter and parts the
curtains slightly We realize his fingers have extremely long
fingernails which are painted gold

We get no view of the being within save a glimpse of

Long golden fingers more articulated more refined than
those of the High Priest - but not really human

Then we see--

Cold eyes strangely distorted We can hardly see them in
the darkness of the litter They are hidden behind a thick
veil

For a long moment the God observes the progress of his tomb
Then a flick of his hand like the recoil of an insect

The High Priest closes the litter’s curtains The bearers
pick up the litter and the procession turns and heads back
toward the palace moving through the construction site

ON THE RAMP

Moha raises his eyes slightly for another look Karen snaps
a warning

KA’ REN
Moha Do not look

Too late One of the slave guards sees Moha looking The
slave guard waits then as soon as the procession is out of
sight he rises calling to several other slave guards

The slave guards GRAB Moha AND THROW HIM OFF THE RAMP

Karen and Lu’Kibu look on in shock as

Moha FALLS seventy feet to his death landing with a
sickening thud

One of the slave guards whips Karen and the others yelling
at them to get back to work

As Karen goes back to the ropes he and LuKibu see Moha’s
body dragged off and thrown onto a sledge that has several
other bodies on it -- the day’s toll of the dead

CUT TO
EXT DUNES BY CONSTRUCTION SITE - SUNSET
A large flock of vultures circles overhead
Three small figures creep through the sand -- DLeh TicTic

and Nakudu doing reconnaissance

DLeh sees the vultures landing one after another
disappearing behind the next dune

D’Leh climbs the dune and looks out to see a gruesome
sight

The corpses of the day have been dumped into the desert
Vultures feast on them

TicTic and Nakudu join DLeh They look out in horror DLeh
SEES Moha among the dead

D’ LEH
Moha

DLeh runs to him The vultures fly off DLeh sinks to his
knees looking at Moha’s dead eyes

EXT SLAVE CHECK POINT - AFTER SUNSET

The sky darkens Endless lines of slaves make their way back
towards their sleeping quarters

They all have to pass by a checkpoint where they get counted
and-- separated

The male slaves march on while the females veer off to their
own quarters located on the opposite side of the slave
encampment

As Evolet nears the point at which the male and female slaves
are separated she sees a LARGE ELABORATELY DECORATED
SUNSHADE sticking out of the crowd coming her way It is
carried by a group of young slave boys

Beneath it walks a heavyset man accompanied by the Warlord
The heavyset man is the CHIEF OF THE GUARDS

They stop at a short distance from Evolet She realizes with
dread that the two men are talking about her

The Warlord and the Chief of the Guards come to agreement on
something They shake hands and the Warlord smiles at
Evolet

Evolet watches the Warlord walk back to his men who hold his
horse

One-Eye is among them having watched all this very
carefully
EXT RIM OF A SAND DUNE - EVENING

DLeh TicTic and Nakudu appear behind a sand dune

In the fading light they watch the long line of male slaves
as they’re herded into their miserable barracks

Suddenly Nakudu’S eyes widen He has spotted Tudu his son

NAKUDU
(whispering)
Tudu

Nakudu can barely hold himself back

DLeh and TicTic spot their own people -- Baku Karen
LU’‘KIBU and the others--

D‘LEH’S eyes search for Evolet but cannot find her

EXT OUTER WALLS - SLAVE QUARTERS - NIGHT (LATER)

Outside the walls DLeh TicTic and Nakudu move into the

shadows at the base of the wall DLeh carries a rope at the
end of which is a GRAPPLING HOOK fashioned from the points of
spears

They check for guards on the top of the wall -- none are
visible DLeh throws the hook and rope up It doesn’t catch
Another throw it catches on the top DLeh starts climbing
The others wait their turns

EXT SLAVE QUARTERS - NIGHT

Slave guards patrol the buildings One of the guards hears a
NOISE too late Nakudu impales him on his spear

DLeh and TicTic move in quickly TicTic points to one of

the buildings DLeh nods and signals They head in that
direction

INTEXT ROOF OF SLAVE QUARTERS - NIGHT (LATER)
DLeh TicTic and Nakudu crawl over the wooden grid of the
ceiling and look down into the horribly crowded slave

barracks

Nakudu touches DLeh’s arm and points to the middle of the
room-—

He has found the two boys

They crawl closer and DLeh peels a piece of bark off one of
the poles making up the grid on which they’re crawling

He throws it at the boys Baku stirs then wakes up He sees
the three figures silhouetted against the deep blue sky

D’ LEH
(loud whisper)
Baku

Baku realizes who it is and he’s overjoyed Baku wakes Tudu
and points Tudu sees his father and can barely restrain
himself

They watch as D’Leh Nakudu and TicTic climb down into the
crowded barracks Other slaves begin to stir

Nakudu tenderly presses his forehead against his son’s

BAKU
D’Leh

D’LEH
Baku where is your sister

DLeh fears the worst

BAKU
The women are in different huts
but she is alive I was with her
today on the mountain

DLeh sighs with relief He sees TicTic among Karen and the
other Mammoth Hunters D’Leh joins them embracing Karen

D’LEH
I thank the Ancient Fathers to find
you alive
(beat)
I need your forgiveness Ka’ren

Karen looks D’Leh in the eyes

KA’ REN
You have it

By now almost all of the captives are awake They gather
around DLeh speaks Nakudu translating

D’ LEH
We came to free you We have many
spears with us They wait behind
the sand

The faces of the captured mammoth hunters light up

Behind them there is a sudden commotion A giant of a slave
NOEH steps up to DLeh speaking to him in a loud and
aggressive tone

DLEH (CONTD)
(to Nakudu)
What do his words mean

NAKUDU
He asks you why you think you can
do what no one has ever done
before

DLeh looks at Nakudu

D’ LEH
Tell him how far we have come

Nakudu speaks to Noeh and the others The slaves become more
and more interested in Nakudu’s words and Noeh’s face slowly
softens as he hears the story

Nakudu steps up to Noeh and speaks to him in an urgent tone
pointing at DLeh and at the giant Sabre Tooth he’s wearing
around his neck This has a profound impact on the crowd
Noeh speaks Nakudu translates
NAKUDU
He asks if you want to go against
the Gods
TicTic answers Nakudu translates
TIC’TIC
Yes We are here to learn about
them so we know how
Noeh thinks for a moment

NOEH
Akka le

NAKUDU
We will walk with him

DLeh TicTic and Nakudu follow Noeh

EXT OUTSIDE THE SLAVE QUARTERS - NIGHT

Outside two SENTRIES make their rounds checking on the
slave barracks Everything seems quiet

INT SLAVE QUARTERS - NIGHT

Noeh leads D’LEH TicTic and Nakudu to the back of the slave
quarters where the old and infirm have been placed

They come to a corner where the ground is covered with hides
Noeh gives a signal

Two of the other slaves roll back the hides revealing a lid
of wooden sticks that cover a deep hole in the ground

The two slaves reach into the hole and lift out a roughly-
made stretcher on which lies an OLD MAN When we see his
milky eyes we realize that he was blinded

Noeh speaks to him and then to Nakudu

NAKUDU
He knows about the gods He was
once their servant

DLeh and TicTic look at each other

TIC’TIC
(to Nakudu)
Ask him what he knows

The BLIND MAN speaks in a weak whispering voice Nakudu
translates

NAKUDU
He believes these Gods came across
the big waterand many say that
they travelled from the stars

The BLIND MAN’S voice can hardly be heard

NAKUDU (CONTD)
First there were three but now
only one of them is left He
builds the mountains so they can
travel back to the stars

D’LEH
(to Nakudu)
There is only one God left Is he

sure
Nakudu translates again and the BLIND MAN nods

DLEH (CONTD)
Can we defeat him

Nakudu asks the BLIND MAN His voice when he finally
answers is barely audible

NAKUDU
He says no man can conquer the
God

DLeh looks at the BLIND MAN with pleading eyes

D’LEH
There must be a way There must be
something we can do

The BLIND MAN remains silent D’Leh sees that this is all the
information they’re going to get He turns to TicTic who
shrugs Then the BLIND MAN speaks again

NAKUDU
He says once only once he heard
the God speak of the one he fears

DLeh listens up

NAKUDU (CONTD)

He says there is a telling of a
strong one who will bring
bloodshed to the house of the Gods
And that one he says bears the
mark of the stars

(beat)
He says the God trembles when he
speaks of the strong one

The BLIND MAN raises his head from the stretcher looking up
with milky eyes
NAKUDU (CONTD)
He asks if you wear the mark of
the stars

DLeh silently shakes his head and the BLIND MAN sinks back
on his bed
EXT OUTSIDE THE SLAVE QUARTERS - NIGHT

The two SENTRIES have found the dead guard They rush off

INT SLAVE QUARTERS - NIGHT

Noeh signals the two slaves to take the BLIND MAN back to his
hiding place

Suddenly D’LEH notices something -- the BLIND MAN is wearing
D’LEH’S FATHER’S IVORY BRACELET

D’ LEH
Who gave you this

The Old Man speaks Nakudu translates
NAKUDU
The man who saved his life when he

ran away from the God

DLeh tries to make sense of that then suddenly hears the
SOUNDS OF GUARDS RUNNING calling out

TIC’TIC
We have to leave

D’Leh speaks urgently to the Blind Man

D’ LEH
Where is this man

They hear the gates of the Slave Quarters being opened
Nakudu hesitates to tell DLeh what the Blind Man said

DLEH (CONT’D)
Tell me

NAKUDU
They killed him years ago His
bones are in the sand with the
others

GUARDS enter the quarters with torches YELLING at the
slaves

No more time DLeh Nakudu and TicTic hurry off the same
way they came in
EXT OUTSIDE THE SLAVE QUARTERS - NIGHT

DLeh Nakudu and TIC’TIC slide down the walls of the Slave
Quarters and disappear into the dark Unseen--

ALMOST At the last moment one of the GUARDS senses
movement by the sand dunes
EXT EDGE OF THE DESERT - NIGHT

The full moon hangs low over the desert We see three dark
shadows rushing up the incline of a sand dune

DLeh TicTic and Nakudu make their way back to their
army’s camp They disappear over the rim of a sand
dunebut

FOUR GUARDS STEP INTO FRAME tracking them

EXT BETWEEN SAND DUNES - NIGHT

DLeh TicTic and Nakudu move through a steep valley between
two towering dunes We hear a CRACKING sound like the
breaking of fire wood

DLeh slows then stops TicTic and Nakudu do the same They
look to the ground -- that’s where the CRACKING came from

HORRIFIED they realize they are standing on an endless field
of human bones and skulls

SWOOSH An arrow flies barely missing Nakudu

They turn and see THE FOUR GUARDS who followed them
ATTACKING

Nakudu throws his spear killing one of the GUARDS

D’Leh TicTic and Nakudu start running toward the crest of
the sand dune The guards chase

We see pain on TicTic’s face as he holds his hand on his
wounded leg DLeh and Nakudu run ahead

Another round of arrows barely misses them

At the crest of the dune TicTic sees that they’re close to
their army’s campthey are about to lead the guards right
into discovering their entire army

TicTic stops turning back to face the GUARDS He STABS one
of them with the White Spear then kills another then pulls
it out and with a mighty thrust throws it and kills yet
another

DLeh turns seeing what TicTic is doing D’Leh races back
to help him

Too late The LAST GUARD SHOOTS AN ARROW which PIERCES
TicTic’S CHEST sending him tumbling down to the bottom of
the dune

DLeh sees Enraged D’Leh THROWS HIS SPEAR powerfully
hitting the guard in the chest killing him instantly

Nakudu rushes back and stops He sees DLeh run to TicTic’s
side with tears welling

DLeh throws himself to the ground kneeling next to TicTic
staring at the wound in his chest in horror DLeh cradles
TicTic’s head Tic’Tic speaks weakly

TICTIC
I am full with days

D’LEH
No do not say that

DLeh looks at him with pleading eyes

D’LEH (CONTD)
Please do not die Great Hunter
We need you

Nakudu looks on in silence from the top of the sand dune as
TicTic gets weaker

D’LEH (CONTD)
(desperate)
What should I do

Tears run down DLeh’s face
TIC’TIC
You never heard the end of Old

Mother’s dream

DLeh leans closer because TicTic’s voice is only a breath
now

TICTIC (CONTD)
In her dream Old Mother sawthat
Evolet will have your children

D’ LEH
My children

TIC’TIC
Yesmany of them

TIC’TIC smiles weakly and puts his hunting whistle in D’LEH’S
hands

TICTIC (CONTD)
I always want you to have this

And with these words he breathes his last breath

DLeh is devastated He stares into the darkness at the
bones of the thousands of nameless dead

SMASH CUT TO

INT WOMEN’S SLAVE QUARTERS - NIGHT

As hellish and cramped as the men’s quarters Hundreds of
women crowded together

THE DOORS BURST OPEN A GROUP OF PRIESTS enter accompanied
by slave guards carrying torches They begin searching
looking among the women for someone

Behind the priests One-Eye

Evolet startles awake She looks around and sees them coming
towards her One-Eye spots her and points her out to the

priests and guards

As the priests approach Evolet all the other slaves move
away from her

The priests pull her to her feet and drag her out of the
quarter

In the background we see One-Eye receiving the rewards for
his betrayal

CUT TO

EXT CAMP IN THE DESERT - NIGHT

THE WHITE SPEAR is stuck in the ground silhouetted against
the setting moon on the horizon

DLeh’s army is gathered honoring the death of the great
hunter

DLeh stands at a mound of rocks TicTic’s resting-place
DLeh is silent apparently drained of emotion

His army watches as Nakudu steps up to him

Nakudu pulls the White Spear from the ground and holds it out
to DLeh

The whole army looks on in anticipation

D’Leh looks at the White Spear After a long moment he takes
it from Nakudu

Then slowly silently DLeh RAISES HIS ARM HOLDING THE
WHITE SPEAR OVER HIS HEAD presenting it to the
warriorshis warriors

Silencethen

AS ONE ALL FOUR HUNDRED WARRIORS RAISE THEIR SPEARS OVER
THEIR HEADS IN SILENT SALUTE

EXT PROCESSIONAL ROADNEAR QUARRY - NIGHT

Evolet is led by the priests toward the palace which is lit
by torches

When she comes closer to the imposing building she sees
another group of priests ahead standing next to the litter
of the God

Evolet slows As she approaches the God she realizes that
all the priests are looking down into the stone quarry
adjacent to the processional road

IN THE QUARRY

A gigantic hole cut out of the bedrock We see THE God for
the first time full figure He is covered in purple and
golden fabric which flows in the wind His hands have
unnatural long fingers covered in gold He is extremely
tall On his head sits a strange crown

The God stands behind some sort of astronomical sighting
device like a cross-staff He is measuring a huge figure
which has been cut out of the bedrock The figure has the
HEAD OF A LION

Precisely lined up with the body of the carving exactly
overhead is the star constellation LEO

AS Evolet AND THE PRIESTS PASS she stares in wonder at the
statue in the pit With her we see what THE SPHINX looked
like when it still had the head of a lion

CUT TO

EXT PALACE ENTRANCE - NIGHT

The priests lead Evolet up the stairs She sees the door at
the top of the stairs opening They enter the palace

INT PALACE GREAT HALL - NIGHT

Evolet finds herself in a vast dark space She hears the
sound of water The priests lead her through a great hall

She looks up seeing an ENORMOUS SHIP floating in a canal of
water which connects the palace with the river

The ship is tied with thick ropes to heavy square pillars
The wood of the ship is very old and dry ancient

INT PALACE HOLDING CHAMBER - NIGHT

Evolet is pushed into a dark chamber She looks around
frightened She listenssilence She walks to the wall
and sits down

EXT CAMP IN THE DESERT - NIGHT

D’Leh sits on a ridge alone The pyramids are visible in the
distance DLeh’s men a good distance away look at him
watching waiting in silence

Some of the warriors begin to whisper among themselves their
faces reflecting their uncertainty Nakudu SHUSHES them
pointing at DLeh as if to say “Quiet he’s thinking”

D’Leh looks at the hunting whistle He weighs it in his hand
thenan idea

DLeh gets up and walks to a spot from which he can address
his men all of whom get to their feet

D’Leh speaks to them with Nakudu translating and other
warriors translating in turn from Nakudu into their
languages

D’ LEH
Hear me You have followed me from
the valley of the spear tooth
Together we crossed the sea of
sand Together we are strong

He draws the White Spear over them encompassing them all

DLEH (CONT’D)
My people the people of the
Yagahl bring down the mightiest of
beasts the Mannak The Mannak is
great and we are small and yet
we kill him We kill him because
we hunt together as one
The men listen carefully

DLEH (CONT’D)
Those who have taken our brothers
and sisters are many Many more
than we are here But together
we can defeat them For though we
are few with our brothers and
sisters who are held there we
become the many

(beat)

When the sun rises we will hunt
our enemy and when the sun sets
tomorrow he will be dead

The men MURMUR among themselves with cold resolution DLeh
raises the White Spear then thrusts it into the earth

DLEH (CONTD)
Butwe go on this hunt without our
spears

Nakudu translating isn’t sure he heard correctly

NAKUDU
(to DLeh)
Without spears With empty hands

D’ LEH
(to Nakudu)
We make them believe we come with
empty hands

SMASH CUT TO
EXT SAND DUNESEDGE OF CONSTRUCTION SITE - PRE DAWN

CLOSE SHOT D’LEH’S FACE Covered with dust like the faces
of the slaves who work on the pyramids

CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that DLeh is crawling up a sand
dune The shot looks very much like the one at the beginning
of the film when DLeh and his tribe were moving in on the
mammoth herd

CAMERA WIDENS further and we see Nakudu and Quina beside
D’Leh their faces also covered with dust

And behind them the four hundred warriors all camouflaged
with dust all looking like slaves except for the spears
they carry

In the distance we see the construction site barely visible
in the pre-dawn light

In the foreground we see about three dozen slave guards on
watch along the perimeter of the construction site
CLOSE ON THE SLAVE GUARDS
D’Leh’s army appears behind them on the crest of a dune On
DLeh’s signal they silently run down the dune and
overwhelm the guards Within seconds all the guards here are

dead

This time DLeh doesn’t make the same mistake His men start
burying the dead guards in the sand

EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAWN
CLOSE SHOT D’LEH APPEARS BEHIND A STONE BLOCK

He watches as his warriors scatter throughout the deserted
construction site

Then DLeh and Nakudu hurry to the base of one of the ramps
They hide between some stone blocks go to their knees and
with their hands dig long shallow holes in the sand a few
inches deep Then they bury their spears carefully obscuring
any sign of the weapons

The rest of DLeh’s men do the same throughout the
construction site Then they secret themselves among the
massive cut stones as well as in other hiding places

When DLeh and Nakudu see the first Slave Guards approaching
they go deeper into hiding

A HORN SOUNDS

EXT SLAVE QUARTERS - DAWN

The gates of the slave barracks are opened and the slaves
are herded toward the construction site

We follow Baku and Tudu They look around and see Karen and
LuKibu walking nearby

EXT RAMP TO THE NEARLY FINISHED PYRAMID - SUNRISE

D’Leh watches from his hiding place Small groups of his army
leave their hiding places joining the long lines of slaves

who are walking to work

DLeh scans the slaves moving past him searching

When he sees Baku Tudu and Karen approaching he gives
Nakudu a sign Both men in a daring move slip into the
passing line of slaves unseen by the guards

He walks near Baku and Karen Ka’ren gives DLeh a nod Baku
is very excited to see DLeh

D’ LEH
(whispers)
Where is Evolet

BAKU
I don’t know

Baku looks around and sees some women lining up for their
work

BAKU (CONTD)
She was with them yesterday

A WHIP LASHES across Baku’s back A slave guard yells at the
boy They walk on DLeh struggles to contain his anger
glaring at the slave guard who whipped Baku

CUT TO

INT PALACE HOLDING CHAMBER - PRE DAWN

Evolet looks up hearing the door open Two priests stand at
the doors Guards enter pull her to her feet and walk her
out

INT PALACE GREAT CHAMBER - PRE DAWN

Evolet is led by the two priests into the cavernous chamber
Early morning light filters in through openings in the
ceiling

When they leave her alone she looks around She sees a big
black stone block with parchments laying on top of it

She inches closer stares in wonder

A MAP - an ancient map but we can clearly see the outline of
the distinctive continental shores of Africa and South
America and North America and a detailed Mediterranean
coastline

Next to that is a STAR MAP

And next to that are CONSTRUCTION DRAWINGS OF THE PYRAMIDS
A noise makes her turn

The High Priest has entered the chamber He looks at her with
curious eyes He slowly comes closer and closer

He starts to speak Asks her questions Evolet does not
understand his language

The High Priest motions for her to turn around

Evolet hesitates then turns her back toward him

The High Priest comes up to her and reaches out with one of
his long painted fingernails and carefully inspects Evolet’s
shoulder

When he sees what he was searching for his face turns to
stone

EXT NEARLY FINISHED PYRAMID BASE OF THE RAMP - DAY
A GUARD WHIPS THE BARE BACK OF ONE OF THE SLAVES

CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal more than a hundred slaves
dragging one of the big stones up the steep ramp DLeh is
among them Next to him we see Karen and Nakudu

Baku and Tudu lubricate the smooth clay of the ramp pouring
water between it and the stone

They are at the base of the ramp

The Slave Guard who supervises their work is the same one
who was responsible for Moha’s death He snaps his whip
lashing the slaves’ backs again and again

As DLeh pulls on the rope he scans the construction site
checking on the placement of his warriors among the slaves --
on the ramps along the processional road among the cut
stones in position everywhere ready to strike

Suddenly D’Leh spots the Warlord Unbeknownst to D’Leh the
Warlord is searching for Evolet

He starts to speak heatedly with the Chief of the Slave
Guards who keeps shaking his head

Frustrated the Warlord looks around and discovers Baku
working on the ramp

When he starts to walks towards Baku D’Leh gives an alarmed
look to Nakudu and Ka’ren

The Warlord comes up to Baku and asks him about Evolet Baku
shakes his head but looks nervous

Then Baku sees a group of Palace Guards coming towards them
They are led by the same group of priests who picked up his
sister Evolet

The Warlord doesn’t see them coming But he has seen Ka’ren
who is working next to Nakudu

The Warlord speaks to the Slave Guard who nods and then
yells for them to stop their work Then he walks up to Ka’ren
and asks him the same question that he asked Baku

D’Leh stands right next to the Warlord

He turns away trying not to be discovered He sees the
Palace Guards coming towards them One of the Priests point
at him

Have they discovered him Should he run

Before he can react the Palace Guards grab the Warlord and
drag him down the ramp

D’Leh watches the Warlord being take away The Warlord
protests as they bind him and march with him towards the
Palace The priests follow

D’Leh exchanges a look of relief with Nakudu and Ka’ren A
whip cracks over them

They take up their ropes and start pulling again

CUT TO

INT PALACE HALLWAY - DAY

The High Priest rushes towards a door at which two palace
guards stand in attendance The priest motions curtly to
them they open the door and he enters

INT PALACE GOD’S CHAMBER - DAY

The High Priest enters the ante chamber Gossamer curtains
obscure his view

We catch glimpses of a group of young servants as they
silently work around the tall figure of the God

As we see the servants more clearly we see that they have
all been BLINDED

The young blinded slaves undress the God The God himself
pulls the long golden fingers off one-by-one handing them
to the slaves who lay them on a table

A closer view reveals that they are not fingers but merely
jewelry

The High Priest comes closer afraid to intrude

Two of the blind servants lift the voluminous outer robe off
the God revealing that his body is much smaller than it
appeared and revealing that his arms and legs are covered
with bandages

The young servants start unwrapping the bandages We catch
glimpses of white wrinkled skin with the signs of an
abnormal skin condition The God’s skin is literally flaking
off

Suddenly all the blind servants turn at a sound The High
Priest quickly prostrates himself totally flat to the floor

The God turns his head and again we see his cold eyes
through the veil which still covers his upper body The veil
distorts our view of his face Who is he What is he

The God listens to the Priest who speaks quickly his face
pressed to the floor

The God is stunned when he hears what the High Priest has to
say

CUT TO

EXT RAMP TO THE NEARLY FINISHED PYRAMID - DAY

DLeh looks around the construction site checking his men
again waiting for the right moment

The slave guard sees Baku and Tudu pausing in their work He
yells at the two boys then whips them The boys cower as the
whip lashes their backs

DLeh decides He nods to Nakudu and Karen then

DLeh BLOWS TicTic’S HUNTING WHISTLE

Its high pitched sound carries over the whole of the
construction site

The slave guard whipping Baku and Tudu stops and turns to
the sound

To his surprise DLeh Nakudu and Karen are right in front
of him They grab the slave guard

He struggles in panic as they THROW HIM OFF THE RAMP

He falls with a stunned expression on his face hitting the
ground far below with a THUD

Everyone heard the whistle everyone saw the slave guard
thrown from the ramp

Time stands still

THEN ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE

What started with DLeh’s little group spreads like fire
over the entire construction site Everywhere guards and
overseers are attacked

In each area it begins with warriors from DLeh’s army who
throw themselves to the sand dig and then RISE UP WITH
SPEARS IN HAND and attack the guards

Other warriors and some slaves use work tools as weapons
attacking the guards

One of the slaves swings a huge stone-cutting hammer
smashing a slave guard in the face As the guard sinks to his
knees another slave finishes him off with a second hammer
blow

Quina digging in the sand finally finds his spear rises
and throws killing a guard

Baku and Tudu together attack one of the slave guards with
Baku going for his legs as Tudu slams him in the face with
his water bucket

The rebellion spreads More and more slaves join with DLeh’s
warriors using their work tools as weapons

Other slaves attack with their bare hands

Everywhere slaves turn against their masters

DLeh Nakudu and Karen fight their way down the ramp then
find their way blocked by the huge stone they were pulling up
the ramp

A small group of slave guards uses the narrow spot between
the stone and the edge of the ramp as their last bastion

DLeh puts his shoulder to the stone block motioning to
Nakudu and Karen to do the same
Other slaves around them realize what they’re doing They
rush over and with the unified effort of a score of them
they push the stone sideways
Which pushes the guards off the edge of the ramp
D’Leh and others continue pushing the stone which goes over
the edge tumbles down the side of the ramp and CRASHES onto
the guards
Other groups of slaves who have seen this follow suit
We see a stunning tableau as GIANT STONE BLOCKS are shoved
over the edges of the ramps FALLING AND CRASHING down
everywhere Their THUNDEROUS SOUND fills the air

SMASH CUT

INT PALACE GREAT CHAMBER - DAY
SILENCE

The thick walls of the palace keep all sounds from outside
out

Evolet and the Warlord lay flat on the ground The tall
figure of the God enters the room

The High Priest cowers in the background watching as the God
walks up to Evolet on the ground and studies her in silence

The God hovers over Evolet
Evolet sees only his high platform shoes

Bursting with anger he rips the clothes off Evolet’s
shoulders

For the first time we see

Evolet has a birthmark that resembles the stars of Orion’s
belt

The God realizes that his worst nightmare is coming true
THE ONE WITH THE MARK OF THE STARS HAS ARRIVED

His cold eyes stare down at Evolet and her birthmark when
Suddenly a group of young priests storms into the Great
Chamber in utter PANIC

They throw themselves in front of the God who has turned in
surprise at the intruders

For the first time we hear the VOICE OF THE God which is
harsh and very foreign-sounding other-worldly

The young priest answers with fear in his voice The news he
brings has a huge impact on those people in the room who can
understand him

Evolet sees the Warlord lying next to her look up in shock
at the Young Priest’s words She looks over at the High
Priest and sees utter disbelief on his face

The God shrieks an order his voice shrill from anger

Palace guards grab Evolet and the Warlord and drag them out
of the chamber

CUT TO

EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

MASSES OF SLAVES spill down the ramps of both pyramids and
converge in the flat part of the construction site

DLeh reaches the bottom of his ramp He runs toward the spot
among some cut stones where he buried the White Spear but a
slave guard intercepts him attacking D’Leh with a spear

DLeh feints throwing the guard off-balance then moves in
pulls the guard’s dagger from his belt and stabs him
grabbing his spear as he falls

He sees the high-walled palace in the distance about a
kilometer away at the end of the processional avenue

DLeh sees Nakudu nearby

D’LEH
Nakudu to the palace

As DLeh starts to run toward the palace Nakudu shouts to
the slaves around him They all follow DLeh who storms
ahead

WE CUT WIDE and see hundreds then thousands of slaves doing
the same following DLeh running down the processional road
toward the high walls of the palace

Most of D’Leh’s warriors carry their spears Some of the
slaves carry weapons taken from the guards Others carry
tools as weapons And still others have only their bare
hands and their fury

EXT PALACE - DAY

The God stands in the shadow of the palace’s main door frame
His cold eyes watch the solitary figure of D’Leh who is
running towards the palace followed by thousands of slaves
In the foreground there’s hectic activity Horses are led
into the courtyard and heavily-armed soldiers and palace

guards rush to their positions

DLeh RUNS now only a couple of hundred meters away from the
palace walls

CLOSE SHOT Heavy ropes are tied to a woman’s hands
THE MASSIVE GATES of the courtyard open

D’Leh slows confused by the opening of the gates before him
The onrushing slaves behind D’Leh slow as well

Then DLeh sees something within the gates that makes his
blood freeze

Evolet in the middle of the courtyard her arms
outstretched her hands TIED TO HORSES on either side of her
READY TO RIP HER APART

One-Eye stands near her a whip in his hand ready to lash
the horses clearly her executioner

In front of her a sea of HEAVILY-ARMED SOLDIERS and PALACE
GUARDS

Behind her the Warlord his hands roped together next in
line to be executed

DLeh stops Nakudu and Karen ease up next to him

All of the slaves behind come to a stop confused that their
leader has stopped

The High Priest turns to the palace entrance

THE God APPEARS FROM OUT OF THE SHADOWS backlit by the giant
sun disc which forms the entrance to the palace

THE SLAVES ARE STUNNED BY THE SIGHT of him Some back up
Others start to prostrate themselves but are held up on
their feet by their comrades

The High Priest SPEAKS TO THE SLAVES his voice firm
ringing castigating

As the High Priest addresses the slaves Baku and Tudu
squeeze through the crowd and join DLeh Karen and Nakudu

Baku sees Evolet ready to be ripped apart and he turns to
DLeh in terror

DLeh starts to move toward Evolet but One-Eye raises his
whip toward the horses warning DLeh not to advance

DLeh sees the horses about to bolt He stops dead in
anguish and fear for Evolet’s life

The High Priest finishes addressing the slaves and turns to
DLeh He speaks Nakudu translates

NAKUDU
He says the God is angry and if
we do not leave we will all be
slain

Everyone looks to DLeh wanting him to make a decision
Evolet strains against the ropes

DLeh grips his spear and decides He gauges the distance
between himself and the God

An impossible throw

DLeh takes a couple steps forward and throws

The spear flies through the air misses Evolet by a hair
heading for the tall figure of the God

The God stumbles backwards trying to evade the spear

THE SPEAR MISSES THE God piercing only his veils

The spear CLATTERS TO THE STONE FLOOR of the entrance hall
For a moment everyone is too stunned to react

Then the palace guards and soldiers prepare to attack

The slaves shy back and then

A RED SPOT OF BLOOD FORMS ON THE God’S VEIL DLeh’s spear
has drawn blood
The God has been injured

Everyone is stunned -- slaves DLeh’s warriors palace
guards and priest

The spot of blood grows and grows

The God clutches his throat but can’t stop the flow of
blood Everyone sees that he is mortal

DLeh sees that One-Eye like everyone else is frozen by the
sight of the God’s blood

DLeh steps forward screaming his battle cry

D’ LEH
Yahalah

He draws his dagger rushing forward wading into the palace
guards trying to make his way to Evolet

A split second later Karen Nakudu and the thousands of
slaves surge forward engaging the palace guards rolling
over them

The High Priest and the God stumble backwards into the shadow
of the palace entrance

Suddenly One-Eye is SLAMMED by the bound arms of the Warlord
He goes down and a foot to the face by the Warlord knocks
him unconscious

Evolet sees the Warlord stepping over One-Eye’s body and an
instant later she sees that the Warlord’s hands are free
and that he holds One-Eye’s dagger in his hands

The Warlord grabs Evolet and cuts her hands free
D’Leh sees the Warlord drag Evolet off

D’LEH (CONTD)
Evolet

DLeh doubles his effort to get to her as the palace guards
retreat into the palace courtyard and the sea of slaves
follows

Other slaves have scaled the high palace walls with ladders
and now jump down on the retreating guards

D’Leh finally reaches the platform where Evolet was standing
and sees the Warlord trying to get the struggling Evolet onto
the back of one of the freed horses Evolet fights the
Warlord like a wild tiger

DLeh armed with the dagger streaks toward the Warlord who
sees him coming

The Warlord PUNCHES Evolet hard knocking her out He heaves

her up onto the back of one of the horses swings himself up
and rides off through the crowd heading for the gates to the
processional avenue

DLeh sees the Warlord ride off with Evolet Desperate he
looks around and sees the other horse

D’Leh runs to the horse and swings himself up onto its back
The horse rears DLeh barely stays on the horse but he

quickly gets the hang of it and rides off after the Warlord
and Evolet

Behind DLeh THE SLAVES STORM UP THE PALACE STAIRS led by
Nakudu and Karen Following close behind them is the Giant
Slave from the slave barracks

ON THE PROCESSIONAL AVENUE the Warlord rides fast heading
from the palace down the long avenue toward the pyramids

Slaves racing toward the palace leap out of the way of the
Warlord’s galloping horse

D’Leh rides hard a hundred meters behind

INT ENTRANCE HALL OF PALACE - DAY

The God followed by a group of his priests including the
High Priest retreats into the palace

The priests watch as the hurrying God rips his veils and
accoutrements from his body furiously getting rid of
everything that made him so tall and mysterious

Turning himself into nothing more than a

FRAIL WHITE OLD MAN

The God holds his bleeding throat screaming orders to his
High Priest and the other priests around him

He runs deeper into the palace with his priests following

THE SLAVES led by Karen Nakudu and the Giant Slave reach
the entrance hall

For a moment they stop in wonder awestruckthen they storm
deeper into the palace
EXT PALACE COURTYARD - DAY

ANOTHER WAVE OF SLAVES arriving at the palace from the
construction site races up the stairs

One-Eye lying at one side of the stairs regains
consciousness and stands

Suddenly Tudu stands in front of him One-Eye sneers at the
boy and moves to draw his dagger and realizes he doesn’t
have it anymore

Tudu motions to someone behind One-Eye It’s Baku who has
climbed the stairs behind One-Eye and now towers over him

Baku holds a spear in his hands and before One-Eye can
react Baku rams it with all his might into One-Eye’s
throat

One-Eye falls dead Baku and Tudu share a look of triumph and
satisfaction

INT BIG HALL - DAY

The WHITE OLD MAN has reached the bow of the ship He

SCREECHES COMMANDS to the priests ordering them to cut the
Many ropes that tie the ship to the building

The priests start doing so but before they can finish they
turn along with the God and see

THE SLAVES POURING INTO THE BIG HALL

The slaves slow at the shocking sight of what was once the
God

But they slow only for a moment then they surge forward
like a giant wave

THE OLD WHITE MAN the High Priest and all the OTHER PRIESTS
disappear in the sea of slaves

We see the OLD WHITE MAN crest the mass of slaves one last
time as he’s lifted over their heads screaming in terror
Then he’s pulled down and he’s gone again

FOREVER
EXT PYRAMIDS PROCESSIONAL AVENUE - DAY

The Warlord rides down the processional avenue approaching
the pyramids The construction site is deserted with all the
slaves having raced to the palace

Evolet is draped across the horse in front of the Warlord
DLeh rides after them

The Warlord turns and sees DLeh coming
Evolet comes to and realizes where she is She immediately
begins to struggle fighting desperately with the Warlord

who tries to control his horse while fending her off

As she struggles Evolet falls from the horse The Warlord
rides on just a bit then sees DLeh coming in fast

The Warlord dismounts racing over to the body of a slave
guard where a bow and quiver of arrows are on the ground

D’Leh rides in before the Warlord can get them Pulling his
dagger from his belt DLeh dismounts and

DLeh and the Warlord square off both armed with daggers
Among the massive cut stones at the foot of the nearly
completed pyramid with the palace in the distance D’Leh and
the Warlord fight with their daggers

Circling around each other feinting looking for an
opening

Both are adept fightersboth are fast
The Warlord moves incutting DLeh who backs up
The Warlord doesn’t let up slashing again and again

DLeh’s backs up further and further retreating into the
jumble of cut stones

The Warlord moves in for the killDLeh falls to the
ground crawling

The Warlord raises his hand with the daggerReady to
strike

Suddenly--

DLeh’s hand grabs in the sand and RISES UP WITH THE WHITE
SPEAR

The Warlord recoils surprised but it is too late

D’Leh THRUSTS it into the Warlord’s chestD’Leh’s entire
retreat was simply a way to get to the buried White Spear

The face of the Warlord shows utter disbelief The Warlord
falls

DLeh runs to Evolet who lies on the ground He throws
himself onto the ground next to her

Her injuries are not severe DLeh AND Evolet EMBRACEthen
suddenly

AN ARROW THUDS INTO Evolet’s BACK

CUT TO

INT OLD MOTHER’S HUT - DAY

Old Mother sitting at her fire startles as if the arrow
had hit her

Worried looks from the tribe’s people all around her

Blood pours again from her nose stronger than ever Her
breath comes hard

CUT TO

BACK TO PYRAMIDS

Evolet is stunnedDLeh is horrifiedshe falls against
DLeh who sees behind her the Warlord holding the bow
trying to notch another arrow

DLeh looks at Evolet seeing the life leave her body

DLeh rises strides to the Warlord picks up a rock from the
quarry debris raises it over his head and SLAMS it down

killing the Warlord

As if in a dream D’Leh walks back to Evolet’s body as
Nakudu and Karen arrive at the scene

Behind them are thousands of cheering slaves ready to
celebrate their hero

When they see what has happened they all fall silent

Baku pushes through the crowd When he sees Evolet’s body he
starts sobbing

DLeh kneels down next to hertears streaming down his face
aS

Evolet DIES IN HIS ARMS

D’Leh looks up at the crowd It seems like the whole world is
collapsing around him

With no emotion left DLeh rises and walks off alone
toward the open desert

CUT TO

INT OLD MOTHER’S HUT - DAY

Dark Old Mother lies on a bed of animal skins bleeding
panting dying

She chantssoftersoftersofter

OLD MOTHER DIES EXHALING HER LAST BREATH

But this is not a breath of this earthit is a WIND

OLD MOTHER’S BREATH blows through the mammoth hides at the
entrance of her hutand through the Valley of the Yagahl

BACK TO THE PYRAMIDS
Baku is clinging to Evolet’s body with tearful eyes
He hears the sound of a gentle BREEZE

There’s a sudden WIND coming from the desert becoming
stronger and stronger

It blows over the sand dunes and reaches the base of the
pyramids

The mourning crowd looks on amazed as the wind catches
Evolet’s and Baku’s hair
EXT DUNES - DAY

DLeh walks alone A sound He turns and sees Baku running to
him

BAKU

D’Leh starts running back toward Evoletpicking up speed

EXT BASE OF THE PYRAMIDS - DAY

DLeh runs through the gathered warriors and slaves who part
to let him through finally revealing

The WIND has picked up in strength and whirls around
Evolet

Filling her lungs giving her life again

Old Mother’s breath enters Evolet’s body No one moves All
are astonished as

Evolet’S EYES OPENshe is weak but alive

DLeh rushes to her side and embraces her like he will never
let go of her again

Nakudu his son Tudu and all the mammoth hunters look on
with great joy

We close in on Baku who wipes his tears from his face
revealing a great smile and

We hear the voice of the OLD MAN who started to tell this
story

NARRATOR (VO)
And this is why Old Mother had to
stay alive to that day

FADE TO

EXT VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHT

NARRATOR (VO)
She gave her last breath to my
sister And then

An ancient man sits by a campfire surrounded by a group of

children Mesmerized they follow his tale and we realize
that

This story has been told by Baku who is now a very old man

The hunting WHISTLE hangs from around his neck

OLD BAKU
(smiling at his children)
Our journey took many moons and was
full of hardship

CUT TO
EXT MOUNTAIN HIGH PASS - DAY

DLeh Evolet Karen and young Baku walk at the head of
their freed brothers as they cross the snows on the
mountain’s crest

They are on their way home

EXT MAMMOTH HUNTERS’ CAMP - DAY

The camp of the Mammoth Hunters looks desolate The remaining
tribe members are all huddled together

The faces of the children betray hunger and despair

Suddenly a little girl jumps to her feet She has spotted
something She starts running toward the mountains

The CAMERA follows her and we see

The return of our heros

There is great joy and celebration as everybody gets to their
feet and starts running toward them

Tears of joy as women unite with their men and children with
their fathers

CLOSE A hand picks up a stone and puts it on a mound of
rocks

EXT EDGE OF CAMP - SUNSET

It is young Baku He and his sister Evolet place stones on a
mound of rocks They have tears in their eyes as they bid
their last farewell to their mother

Evolet looks over and sees

DLeh standing before another mound of rocks This is Old
Mother’s final resting place

CUT TO

EXT MOUNTAIN HIGH PASS - DAY

DLeh Evolet Karen and young Baku walk at the head of
their tribe as all the Mammoth Hunters cross the mountain

They are all wrapped in mammoth furs as snow flurries dance
around them
EXT NAKUDU’S VILLAGE - DUSK
Nakudu and his tribe work the fields

Young Tudu is the first one who sees the trek of the Mammoth
Hunters as they approach the village

Tudu’s face lights up as he sees Baku running toward him

Nakudu looks on and smiles as he sees that DLeh and his
people have come to join them

OLD BAKU (VO)
All this was a long long time
ago

EXT VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHT
OLD Baku looks over to another old man

OLD BAKU
But I still remember it as if it
was only a heartbeat ago

The two old men smile at each other and we realize that
Baku’s old friend is Tudu He looks as ancient as Baku but
he still has the same sparkle in his eyes

CUT TO

EXT LAKE - SUNSET
DLeh and Evolet have arrived on the shore of the Naku Lake

OLD BAKU (VO)
And the Ancient Fathers had
wandered with us and guided our
path to our new land where the sky
holds two suns

DLeh smiles at Evolet and together they look out at the
horizon where they watch in awe as

The setting sun mirrors itself in the still waters of the
lake

OLD BAKU (VO) (CONTD)
And so it came to pass that the
dream of Old Mother was fulfilled
and what was written in the stars
came true

DLeh takes his WHITE SPEAR and drives it into the ground
This is the land they will call their home

And as the CAMERA widens on a boulder in the distance we
see the majestic silhouette of a SABER TOOTH TIGER

He lets out a MIGHTY ROAR

EXT VILLAGE SQUARE

Old Baku is finished with his story There’s a long moment of
silence

A boy of perhaps thirteen who looks very much like Baku
when he was a boy raises his voice

BOY
Baku what happened to the
mountains you and Tudu helped
build

Old Baku looks over at Old Tudu They both shrug

OLD BAKU
Everyone returned to their homes
No one wanted to stay in such a
place Too much sorrow too many
dark memories So no one really
knows

Everyone is silent contemplating Old Baku’s words

And we hear the sound of wind as in the beginning of the
film

It takes us to
EXT DESERT - SUNSET

We fly over endless sand dunesand then in the distance
we see them

THE PYRAMIDS
They rise out of a sea of sand but the desert is slowly
reclaiming them Behind the pyramids we see the red glowing

ball of a dying sun
