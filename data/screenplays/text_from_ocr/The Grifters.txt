bore talks with a potential RENTER

SIMMS
Put it this way now Say I rent to
a woman well she has to have a
room with a bath I insist on it
because otherwise shes got the
hall bath tied up all the time
washing her goddamn hair and her
clothes and everything she can
think of

In bg Roy still in pain comes out of the elevator waves
to Simms who waves back without pausing in his monologue
and crosses to the mailboxes

SIMMS
Now your minimum for a room with
bath is three hundred a month just
for a place to sleep and no cooking
allowed
And just how many of these tootsies
make that kind of money and have to
eat in restaurants and buy clothes
and --

Roy carrying his junk mail and pretending not to be in pain
crosses to Simms

ROY
Mr Simms

SIMMS
(fawning)
Why yes Mr Dillon Heres a
potential new neighbor looking at--

ROY
(uninterested)
Uh-huh Mrs Langtry may drop by

Simms doesnt like Mrs Langtry but cant say so

SIMMS
Ill send her right up

Roy goes back to the elevator Simms continues his monologue

SIMMS
I had my first hotel thirty-seven
years ago in Wichita Falls Texas
and thats where I began to learn
about women They just dont make
the money you see not regular
they dont and theres only one
way they can get it

Roy enters the elevator

SIMMS
Now that Mr Dillon there thats
the fine type of person I have in
mind for here Like yourself I
have no doubt Hes a salesman
regular as clockwork has a suite
here Fine man Now about these
women At first you know they
just go out and do it now and then
just enough to make ends meet But
pretty soon they got that bank open
twenty-four hours a day and then
youve got trouble Hookers and
hotellin just dont mix
Youd think the copsd be too busy
catching real criminals not
snooping around after working
girls but thats the way the gravy
stains as the saying is and I
dont fight it An ounce of
prevention is my motto

Myra enters from the front looks across at Simms points
upward Simms calls to her

SIMMS
Oh yes Mrs Langtry hes up
there hes expecting you

Myra crosses to the elevator Simms speaks more softly

SIMMS

If you keep out the women in the
first place see you keep out the
hookers and then you keep out the
cops and thats how you have a
clean place

A brightly lit Hopperish place Lilly sits alone in a booth
eating a bowl of chili and reading a newspaper folded beside
the bowl A DRUNK with a great deal of faith in his own charm
sits with a male FRIEND at the counter drinking coffee The
drunk keeps looking toward Lilly grinning COMMENTING
playfully to his friend whos bored by it all Lilly doesnt
seem to be aware of him

The drunk rises from his stool turning toward Lilly
staggering slightly His friend makes a small move to stop
him then shrugs and lets him go The drunk makes his way to
Lillys table leans on it

DRUNK
Pretty woman like you shouldnt eat
alone Whadaya wanna eat alone for

Lilly gives him a flat look

LILLY
Go away

She looks past him toward the WAITRESS behind the counter

LILLY (CONTD)
(calling)
Could I have some coffee please

WAITRESS
Right away

DRUNK
We could have coffee together My
names Kenny

Lilly looks over at the drunks friend who pointedly ignores
the situation

LILLY
Your pal wants you

The drunk could turn mean his gesture brushing away the idea
of his friend is stronger than necessary

DRUNK
Let him find his own pretty woman
The waitress arrives with the coffee pot and a mug She puts
the mug on the table pours coffee

WAITRESS
This fellow bothering you Maam

LILLY
Yes

WAITRESS
(to the drunk)
Why dont you go sit down

DRUNK
Ill sit here Move over

The drunk wants to sit beside Lilly who looks to the
waitress to solve the problem but the waitress stands there
with the coffee pot looking helpless The drunk bends to
slide onto the seat Lilly exasperated rabbit punches him
in the throat

The drunk astounded and in pain (and not breathing)
staggers back flailing hitting the waitresss arm so that
she slops coffee on him as his feet tangle and he falls
heavily onto the floor

Lilly suddenly concerned slides out of the booth

LILLY
Oh Are you all right

She goes to one knee beside the drunk who clutches his own
throat with both hands retching as he tries to inhale Lilly
looks up at the astonished waitress

LILLY (CONTD)
I shouldnt have hit him that hard
I guess I dont know my own
strength

The drunks friend arrives and helps Lilly get the drunk to
his feet The drunk is breathing now but shaken He looks at
Lilly with reproachful eyes His friend transfers his
annoyance at the drunk to Lilly

FRIEND
You didnt have to do that

LILLY
(matter of fact)
I thought I did You should take

He slaps her openhanded but hard and she staggers back He
pursues her

He slaps her as hard with the other hand Astonished
frightened befuddled she backpedals bringing her forearms
up to protect her face He grabs her two wrists in one hand
holds them out of the way slaps her forehand and backhand
forehand and backhand

MYRA

He suddenly gets control of himself releases her steps back
into the middle of the room Hes angry but also remorseful
sorry he lost control but still enraged at the enormity of
her suggestion

ROY

violence

She cowers against the wall peering in terror at him through
her raised arms He settles down becomes heavily calm

ROY

Goodbye Myra

She lowers her arms slowly as though her whole body aches
Shes still scared but angry now too Shed like to tell
him off but discretion tells her not to She moves across
the room toward the open door but stops not wanting to be
that close to him

Understanding he backs away from the doorway gestures with
cold irony for her to proceed She moves to the threshold
looks back at him

and he slams the door

stinker not to be a grown-up when
you needed a grown-up

Roy didnt expect to be made uncomfortable and defensive and
he resents it

ROY

ROY
(hoarse)
Whats that all about Of course

TWO SHOT Lilly leans forward toward Roy inviting him

LILLY
(very soft)
Roy Roy

Roy will not let anything complicated come to the surface

ROY
Theres nothing more to talk about

LILLY

(very soft)
I have to have that money Roy
What do I have to do to get it

AN ANGLE on Roy his face bruised-looking eyes scared He
will not know whats going on He shakes his head not
trusting himself to speak

AN ANGLE on Lilly leaning forward tension showing through
the seductive manner

LILLY
No Wont you give me the money
Roy Cant I change your mind What
can I do to change your mind

TWO SHOT as Lilly gets to her feet and takes a step toward
him Roys pressed back into his chair trying to maintain a
cold facade

ROY
Lilly Jesus what are you doing
LILLY
Is there nothing I can do Roy
nothing at --

ROY
No

They both turn away at the same instant Roy turns to the
side to pick up the glass of water to break the spell and
the tension Lilly turns back toward the coffee table and
picks up the attache case Roy lifting the glass to drink
turns forward again as Lilly spins forward swinging the
attache case at his head with all her might The case crashes
into the glass and into his face Roy SCREAMS and topples off
the chair as the one remaining clasp on the case lets go and
money goes flying filling the air

AN ANGLE DOWN at Roy face up expression horrified hands to
his throat A large triangle of glass is in his throat Blood
pumps thickly fountaining up

CU Lilly staring down in horror She lurches forward but
theres nothing to do She stares around

ECU wads of bills on the floor getting bloody
CU Lilly in agony but looking down kicking
ECU Lillys feet kicking the bills away from the blood

TWO SHOT as Lilly drops to her knees beside Roy whos
already dying Blood spurts less forcefully His hands fall
to his sides eyes stare upward mouth still moves slightly
Lilly shoving money away with her hands now stares at him
willing it not to happen He stops moving His eyes dull
Lilly clasps her arms around herself She knows she doesnt
dare scream Lips drawn back in a snarl teeth clenched she
HISSES her agony through her teeth She HISSES she HISSES
she HISSES Then slowly she regains control

WIDE SHOT as Lilly gets to her feet She seems dazed now
like someone whos just been in a traffic accident She
blunders around the room kicks the attache case bends to
pick it up She studies the clasp sees it still works goes
back to her knees

LOW ANGLE Lilly in fg Roy in bg as Lilly repacks the
money into the case wiping the blood from some wads onto the
carpet Finishing she closes the case then remains on her
knees bending over the case She WEEPS grindingly

WIDE SHOT entrance door in bg Lillys weeping subsides
She gets wearily to her feet and leaves the room CAMERA
HOLDS SOUND of water running in sink SOUND STOPS Lilly
reappears She does not again look toward Roy She picks up
the attache case crosses to the door opens it steps across
the threshold reaches back to switch off the light GO TO
BLACK

THE END
