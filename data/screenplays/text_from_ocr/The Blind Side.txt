EXT LAFORCHE HOME - DAY

Sun spikes through the jostling leaves of a maple tree A
strong wind bends them back showing their light green
bellies

This is a modest house in a row of modest houses Propane
tanks and farmland at their backs show this neighborhood to
be more rural than suburb

CURTIS LAFORCHE stands in his driveway His eyes locked
on the sky narrow as he stares at

A STORM CELL stretching out on the horizon in front of him
Its a bruised sky filled with a vicious mixture of black

gray clouds They swirl in and out of one another sending
wispy tentacles toward the ground

Curtis stands awestruck

The clouds move fast overhead He looks up as they overtake
his position A light rain begins

The rain pats the ground It makes soft indentions on his
cotton shirt He watches it hit the concrete falling harder
now He notices something strange

The rain makes dark spots on the sidewalk He pulls his
shirt out and sees dark spots forming there He holds his

palm out flat in front of him The rain pools

He rubs the water through his thumb and fingers Its an
feeds

amber color viscous like fresh motor oil

Curtis looks to the sky the rain pelting his face now
Jagged angry clouds blanketing overhead The wind bends
back the trunk of the maple tree

Curtis stands alone at the base of the surging STORM CELL

TITLE TAKE SHELTER

INT BATHROOM - DAY

Curtis holds his head under the running shower nozzle Cool
clean water rushes over his face

INT KITCHEN - DAY

SAMANTHA stands at the stovetop stirring eggs in a pan
Shes still dressed in her sleeping attire an oversized T-
shirt and pajama bottoms with cartoon frogs on them
HANNAH sits at the kitchen table tearing up a piece of
toast and feeding it to the dog

Hannah is a blonde little girl with a large hearing aid
wrapped over her right ear It clips into her hair near the
back of her head The dogs name is Red a Rhodesian
Ridgeback that appreciates the attention

Curtis enters the kitchen and kisses Hannah on the head In
the same motion he takes the piece of toast from her hand
and sets it on her plate

his mouth and sack lunch in his hand he makes his way down
the porch steps and onto the front walk

He pops open the chain-link gate and heads for the PICK-UP
parked on the street Clear blue sky overhead

EXT SOYBEAN FIELD - DAY

Small soybean plants slouch in the noonday sun A slight

breeze picks up jostling the leaves but the sound is

drowned out by a loud mechanical rumbling

A spiral drill churns up dark soil as it digs deeper into
the

ground Curtis wearing work goggles grabs hold of the

drills cabling system and yanks down

CURTIS
Yeah lets keep going with that
bit Itll go another 10 feet
He yells to DEWART a big guy sitting at the controls of

rusted bed with metal scaffolding raised HIGH on its back

touches her chin bringing her eyes back around

Samantha stands and takes the board to a trash pile in the
back corner of the yard A STORM SHELTER is buried in the
ground just behind the pile Its a grass covered mound with
two rusted metal doors angled toward the sky
She throws the board onto the heap and wipes her hands on

pants Staring at the pile she lets out an irritated sigh
Thunder rumbles low in the distance She looks up at the

approaching clouds and calls to the children as she walks
back inside

SAMANTHA (CONTD)
Hey DJ Bring the girls inside

EXT SOYBEAN FIELD - DAY

THUNDER STRIKE
The drill bit spins as rain pelts the ground turning the

soil into black mud
Curtis holds a rain slicker over his head He watches as the
hole they are drilling fills up with brown water He lifts
his boot which makes a sucking sound as it dislodges from
the mud

Looking at the horizon he sees no sign of the storm letting
up He looks to Dewart who smiles at him from behind the
controls of the rig

DEWART

Running for her car holding a jacket covered car seat
Samantha closes the door and listens to her quiet house The
rain outside is the only noise She heads to the kitchen

IN THE KITCHEN

Hannah is sitting Indian-style at the glass doors watching
the rain Samantha walks over and kneels down behind her
She wraps her arms around Hannah who lifts a hand to the
glass
SAMANTHA (CONTD)

Samantha puts her hand onto the glass next to Hannahs and
signs s-t-o-r-m Hannah turns to see her mothers face
and Samantha uses both hands to make the signed symbol
Fingers spread and bent moved downward

together

CURTIS
Good night

Nat in a house robe and slippers weaves her way through
the

maze of junk on their front lawn

Dewart passes her without saying a word Curtis watches as

she follows him inside the house still talking He shifts

into drive and pulls away

INT LAFORCHE HOME - NIGHT

The lights are out and the house is quiet Curtis eases open

the front door and steps inside Standing on the door mat

he slips off his mud-caked boots and gently sets them aside

AT HANNAHS BEDROOM DOOR

Curtis places his palm flat on the door and lets it open

Hannah is curled up with the covers He watches her sleep

Samantha barefoot and wearing a sleep shirt walks up
behind

Curtis He turns his head when she approaches
CURTIS

(SOFTLY)
Hey baby
She wraps her arms around his waist and he lifts his elbow

CURTIS (CONTD)

She smiles up at her husband

SAMANTHA
I still whisper
He pulls her tight They stand together in the doorway The
house is silent

EXT LAFORCHE BACKYARD - DAY

Curtis loads pieces from the trash pile into a wheelbarrow
He keeps an eye on Hannah as she jumps on a small plastic
playscape in the middle of the backyard

The dog Red paces by the back door Hes agitated but his
movement is limited by the length of rope tied from his
collar to a nearby post He barks

THUNDER STRIKES
Curtis flinches at the loud boom He looks to the sky and
sees dark clouds twisting overhead Hannah plays unaffected
the

by the noise
To get a better view Curtis moves from beneath a tree in

corner of the yard and surveys the large swath of farmland
that runs up to his property

Chain-link fencing partitions the yard from a deep concrete
culvert that leads out to the open field

A giant STORM CELL gathers force on the horizon there

Red barks incessantly He winces and strains against the
rope tied to his collar

Curtis flinches again as A BOLT OF LIGHTNING streaks to the
ground in the distance Sparks shoot into the air leaving a
circle of scorched crops Another CRACK of thunder

A light rain begins Red snaps his head around and bucks
into the air He gnashes at the rope

Curtis collects Hannah off the playscape and turns back to
the approaching STORM CELL He holds up his hand and studies
the falling rain Its the thick amber colored liquid

With Hannah in his arms Curtis watches awestruck as wispy
tentacles drip to the ground forming a collection of THREE
TORNADOS out in the field
Behind them Reds teeth fray the rope at his collar He
thrashes his head the rope SNAPS and the dog flies toward
Curtis and Hannah
Curtis turns to see Red charging them He barely has time to
set Hannah down before Red catches him by the forearm

They crash to the ground tangled together Rain coming down
hard now

Curtis yells and waves Hannah back Red snapping buries
his teeth into the muscles in Curtis arm Blood streams
from the wound

Curtis screams in pain

INT BEDROOM - DAY

Curtis bolts up in bed grabbing his forearm He grinds his
teeth and doubles over in pain It takes a moment for him to
find his bearings

His breathing slows He gently rubs his hand over the skin
on his arm Sweat has collected around his collar and
temples

From the bed sheets in a twisted mess he looks around the
room unsure of what just happened to him
INT KITCHEN - DAY

Eggs cool on a plate

Curtis sits at the kitchen table dressed for work He stares
vacantly at his breakfast

He looks up at Hannah She sits on the floor surrounded by
toy building blocks and plays with the dog She rubs under
Reds chest and in turn he licks her face She smiles and
gently pushes him away

Samantha sits with her knees up drinking coffee

SAMANTHA
Curtis

CURTIS

SAMANTHA

SAMANTHA (CONTD)

CURTIS
Nothing I just want her to eat her
breakfast and stop playin with the

He removes his goggles eyes fixed on the acres of farmland
that stretch for miles in front of him
In the sky overhead

AN ENORMOUS FLOCK OF BIRDS ROLL IN UNISON
Hundreds of them make up a black swarm that twists and

in the air They dive bomb then ascend in intricate
GEOMETRIC patterns

Curtis watches mesmerized

Dewart strains a wrench against a bolt as the drill

in reverse

DEWART
Curtis
Curtis acknowledges Dewart but cant take his eyes off the
pattern of birds They shrink and stretch from thick clumps
to long cylindrical tubes A choreography
Curtis reluctantly heads back to the rig which is shrieking
with the SOUND of metal on metal

The lack of light makes it feel more cavernous than it is
Two cots have been brought down as well as an assortment of
supplies Canned food a small gas burner

Curtis hangs the lantern onto a hook on the wall and goes
about connecting the toilet to a pipe sticking out of the
back corner

stares at her on the verge of breaking down

She takes her hand and gently pulls his head down to her

leads her family out of the dining hall

EXT LAFORCHE HOME - DAY

Hannah stands on a toolbox and rests her elbows on the side
of Curtis truck The hood is open She watches her father
fiddle with re-installing the alternator His fingers
covered in grease

Hannah steps down from the toolbox and walks into the front
yard Curtis pauses hearing a high-pitched warbling SOUND
in the distance He notices Hannah is gone

Hannah
He pulls his head out from the hood and sees Hannah standing
on the curb She looks down the street He runs down his
driveway wiping his hands on a rag and watching the

CURTIS (CONTD)
Hannah

A FLOCK OF BIRDS flying in intricate geometric patterns
swarm above the house at the end of the street They twist
and bend into speckled black shapes
Hannah watching walks into the street Curtis catches her
by the hand He turns away from the birds to see a STORM
CELL building on the opposite horizon He scoops Hannah into
his arms stepping back from it
The SOUND of the birds grows louder Curtis pivots to find
the mass of birds barreling down the street toward him He
turns away as the wall of birds crash past him The force so
powerful it knocks him backward
He covers Hannahs head dodging the onslaught of wind and
wings The Flock passes Curtis stands his face cut and
scraped Hannah cries clinging to his chest

He climbs onto the cot and puts his arm around them He
slips on his gas mask

Samantha is hesitant She looks at her husband in the mask
and leans back against the side of the container Hannah
looks up at her She touches her mothers mask

Samantha slips on the gas mask

The camping lantern on the floor casts long shadows up The
faint boom of thunder rolls softly outside

The family sits huddled together on the cot wearing their
masks

INT STORM SHELTER - LATER

A CRACK of thunder rattles the shelter Curtis snaps awake

still wearing his gas mask

Samantha has climbed on the other cot and is asleep Hannah

sleeps under Curtis arm He gently lays her down on the cot
and stands to stretch

He walks into the original section of the shelter and grabs

moves over to the concrete steps

metal door A BOOM of thunder

He can hear the rain and wind blowing outside

illuminating the padlocked metal doors

He looks back at his family then climbs the steps He
places his hand on the door He flinches

Its still storming

SAMANTHA
No Its not

CURTIS

Samantha stares at him The room is silent

SAMANTHA

watches her face as she places a hand against the metal She

He looks at Hannah then Samantha Curtis steadies himself
trying to control his flinching He wipes his face with the
back of his hands and takes a deep breath

Curtis walks toward the doors On the steps he reaches up
to the padlock The keys shake in his fingers He turns to
Samantha

CURTIS
Could you move Hannah back

Samantha picks Hannah up in her arms and Curtis watches them
retreat to the rear wall

He goes back to the lock He inserts the key The padlock
pops open Curtis removes it He looks back at Samantha
then flings open the doors

SUNLIGHT

Its blinding Curtis holds his hand up to cover his eyes
He stares up at a crystal blue sky Samantha watches as
Curtis steps out of the shelter

EXT LAFORCHE BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

Curtis rises through the storm shelters entryway Out of
the corner of his eye he catches

A MAN PASSING BY

Curtis is startled He turns to see a CREW of MEN from the
power company hoisting a ladder onto the pole at the corner
of the house A power line dangles overhead

He turns to see NEIGHBORS in their yards clearing debris
Leaves and branches clutter the ground The aftermath of a
storm

Samantha steps out of the shelter holding Hannah She
surveys the damage

CURTIS
Its fine
She walks over to Curtis and hugs him He kisses Samantha on
the head Curtis looks up at the sky
INT PSYCHIATRIST OFFICE - DAY

Curtis sits with Samantha in the plush office of a
PSYCHIATRIST Curtis rubs his hand over the soft leather
upholstery on the couch

PSYCHIATRIST
Do you have any vacation time that
you could use

CURTIS
I dont have a job right now

PSYCHIATRIST
Well I know that times are hard
but I think its really important
for you to separate yourself from
that storm shelter

(MORE)

PSYCHIATRIST (CONTD)
I think you need to break away from
it for awhile We can start you on
some medication that I think will
help but that action alone would
mean a lot

SAMANTHA
We usually go on a trip to Myrtle
Beach every summer We were gonns
go this month

PSYCHIATRIST
I think that would be okay if we
start the medication now It would
give you all some time to prepare
as a family but I want to be
clear when Curtis gets back hell
need to take more time than that

SAMANTHA
What does that mean

PSYCHIATRIST
I mean that hell need hands on
the

therapy at a real facility
Curtis looks up for the first time

CURTIS
You mean I have to leave my family

PSYCHIATRIST
I think you need to seriously
commit to some treatment
Curtis processes this Samantha takes his hand

EXT BEACHCONDO - DAY
Curtis scoops handfuls of sand out of a foot deep hole on

beach He slops the wet mixture into a castle shaped bucket
his back to the shoreline of gentle breaking waves

CURTIS
(signing and speaking)
Hey Good huh
Hannah sits on her knees in front of Curtis sprinkling dry
sand over castle shaped mounds already formed

INT CONDO - DAY

Samantha drops four hotdogs into a boiling pot of water and
stirs a bubbling pot of canned chili

The beach condo is small but brightly furnished

EXT CONDOBEACH - DAY

The wooden deck hangs off the back of the beach condo A
picnic table is set with plastic place mats and forks WIND
lifts the corner of a stack of napkins The wind blows
harder fanning the napkins off the table

castle

Curtis smooths out the sand in the castle shaped bucket and
turns it over to top off their sand mound He hands the
bucket over for Hannah to refill

The SOUND of the waves behind them has STOPPED They dont
notice

Curtis takes two fingers and digs a small trench around the
sand castle

Curtis looks up ready to sign the letters but sees Hannah
staring at the water She looks at him and signs something
with her hands

CURTIS (CONTD)
What is it honey
Curtis misses it He shakes his head no and Hannah signs
again slowly S-T-O-R-M

CURTIS (CONTD)
What
Curtis turns to the shoreline getting to his feet
He looks down at Hannah who watches mesmerized Scared
she looks to her father He grabs her under the arms and
rests her on his hip She buries her head into his chest

AT THE CONDO
A gust of wind greets Samantha as she walks out onto the

holding a plate of hotdogs and a bowl of chili She stops
seeing the horizon Her mouth falls open

She slowly sets the plate and bowl down on the table her
mind racing She looks down at Curtis in disbelief

Curtis looks up to the Condo and makes eye contact He
studies her face

Samantha looks at her husband trying to process it all She
looks out at the horizon then back down to Curtis Concern
on her face she nods to him

Curtis sees her nod

Samanthas eyes still locked on Curtis soften as if to
apologize After a moment she mouths to him I love you
Curtis nods back to her

She looks back up to the shoreline

ON THE BEACH
Curtis feet kick up sand as he rushes back toward the
AT THE CONDO

Samantha hasnt moved from the porch A light rain begins to
fall Her hands grip the railing She turns her left palm
up Dark rain collects there

ON THE HORIZON IN FRONT OF HER

THE WATER HAS RECEDED INTO THE GULF SOME 100 YARDS THE DARK
SANDY BOTTOM LOOKS ODD STRETCHED OUT SO FAR A STORM CELL
SITS MASSED ON THE HORIZON CHURNING BLACK CLOUDS FILLED

WITH LAYERS OF HORIZONTAL LIGHTNING

Behind Samantha Curtis appears in the open sliding door
clutching Hannah The Storm Cell is reflected in the glass
next to him

Samantha looks down at her palm She rubs the thick viscous
rain in her fingers She looks back up at the storm
On Samanthas face
