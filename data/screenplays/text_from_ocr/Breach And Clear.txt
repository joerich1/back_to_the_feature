I Well this is a kind of a
strange thing to talk about with
you being that you’re my boss

protecting the world and all --

GEORGE
Spill it Kate

KATE
I’m in love

Whoa George takes the news in

GEORGE
Julian

KATE

Easy sorry Who is it then

INT JEWELRY STORE - DAY
Flanked by Pete and Teddy Mike talks to a SALESWOMAN
SALESWOMAN
Congratulations Do you know what

kind of ring you’re looking for

MIKE
Um --

PETE
He wants the Kobe ring

TEDDY
Yeah Cleaned out his savings

SALESWOMAN
So you have how much to spend

MIKE
About fifteen hundred

A beat

SALESWOMAN
Let me see what we have in back

INT GEORGE’S OFFICE - DAY

George leans back in his chair

GEORGE
So this Mike he doesn’t know what
you do

KATE

No But I want to tell him

GEORGE
You know what the rules are Kate
Youre not expressly forbidden to
tell loved ones what you do You
just have to be careful about it

KATE

I know but Mike he’s a normal
guy with a normal job And he
thinks I’m just like him -- he
thinks I sell insurance And he
doesn’t like me because I’ve killed
three of the top five terrorists in
the world and allegedly maimed a
fourth he likes me for me I’m
worried if I tell him the truth
things will change between us

GEORGE

So don’t tell him Lots of couples
have secrets between them For
every serial killer there’s a
happy spouse that has no idea what
that smell in the basement is

KATE
I’m not a serial killer

GEORGE
Yet you have killed lots of people

Kate makes a face George grins then looks at her sincere

GEORGE
Look No man has fallen in or out
of love with a woman because of
what she does for a living So if
you love him and if you trust him
then you should tell him

KATE
(smiles)
Thanks George
George nods Kate heads for the door
GEORGE
Hey Kate Mike’s a lucky guy
I look forward to meeting him

EXT MIKE’S HOUSE - DAY

Mike chugs a plastic red cup of Bud and almost pukes He’s
playing BEER PONG in the backyard with Pete and Teddy

MIKE
Two against one -- this isn’t fair
PETE
It’s beer pong Who cares about
fair
MIKE

I’m drinking twice as much as you

TEDDY
That’s the plan

PETE
Think of it as your bachelor party
without the whores and crystal meth

Mike takes a shot misses

MIKE
Shit

PETE
So how are you gonna propose

MIKE
What do you mean

PETE
What do I mean Please tell me
youve put some thought into this

TEDDY
You know what you should do Mike
Take Kate up in a hot air balloon
Watch the sunset together then
tell her how much you love her and
get down on one knee

PETE

A hot air balloon Could you be
more gay and less original

(to Mike)
Look the way I see it there’s a
50-50 no 60-40 chance she says no
no matter what you do But if you
just throw a ring in her face and
mumble some bullshit you’re doomed

MIKE
60-40

PETE
Just being honest

TEDDY
Make her a mix tape

PETE

That’s a great idea Oh wait
Mike’s not asking her to the prom

(to Mike)
Alright hear me out Take Kate to
a fancy hotel And this part is
crucial -- get her drunk I mean
shitfaced Then do everything you
can to give her an orgasm Bring
out the toys if you have to Now it
will probably be the first time
youve given her one and that’s
fine it will work for you here
Because when she’s saying “yes yes”
that’s when you’re gonna take out
that ring and pop the question And
you’re gonna hold her to one of
those yeses Mike

MIKE
I’m not gonna propose while we’re
having sex

PETE
70-30
TEDDY
Karaoke But instead of a song
you sing your proposal

PETE
Okay just admit it You love cock
It’s fine -- I have no problem with

it It’s the lying I can’t take
Teddy wrestles Pete to the ground Mike’s phone rings

JULIAN
Hold on Now that we know where

It wouldn’t weaponize

This sinks in McIntyre turns to Cindy
