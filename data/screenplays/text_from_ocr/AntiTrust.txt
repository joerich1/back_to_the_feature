ALICE
Cmon how often do you talk to
somebody whos been on the cover of
Time Three of four times

She picks her way through geek clutter (motherboards

manuals Coke cans) sits next to him

MILO
A lot of what Larry says is true
They just clone stuff or reverse
engineer it and everybody gets stuck
with their inferior version cause
they --

ALICE
Then youve gotta ask him about that

He looks at her youve gotta be kidding

ALICE
Its important

MILO
If hes really a bully he wont cop
to it anyway

ALICE
Bully Are we talking about Gary

GARY
Theres a rumor going around maybe
youve heard it

Gary heads back carrying something spherical

GARY
Theres more to life than computers
Im looking into it

Glancing down at the daunting display of books Gary
vaguely afflicted He mutters

GARY
Once I start looking into something

Looking up now (and much more at ease) he holds up a
detailed metal object model satellite

GARY
Ive only shown this to three other
people I bought 200 weve launched
12 so far I keep the coordinates in
this room
(as Milo takes it
carefully)
Its left over from SDI Reagans
Star Wars technology They orbit 426
miles up

MILO
Low enough to relay internet traffic

GARY
(he smiles exactly)
Among other things We know
convergence is the real super-highway
all the PCs TVs phones etc
linked together Why cram it into a
cable if you can use the whole sky

MILO
(turning the sleek
object)
Skywire

INT GARYS WORKROOM - LATER

Milo and Gary peer at a monitor side-by-side Milo
sips his
own Snapple now Gary speaks his language

GARY
The content filer has tbe written
into the media files so bits coming
off the satellite can be read by
multiplatforms Really omniplatforms
ncluding whatever new hardware
emerges

MILO
t needs a more object-oriented
language This doesnt scale does
it

GARY
Youd have to start practically from
scratch But this is all youd be
working on No marketing meetings
no product seminars We cant waste
the time Half the Valleys working
on convergence Sore media
conglomerates cable companies phone
companies Cant finish second
Milo There is no second Now what
would you like to ask me

Milo has a deer-in-the-headlights look

MILO
Ask you

INT GARYS HOUSE - ANOTHER ROOM - DUSK

versions on the world we havent
done anything original since 10

Milos amazed by Garys acuity And his candor

GARY
Do I think thats fair No Id put
some of our apps up against anybodys
But is there some truth to it

They have come to a stop in a windowed entryway Milo
watches
Gary keenly Gary nods He knits his brow

GARY
When you get to a certain age you
start wondering About your legacy
I doubt you even remember Outpost

MILO

Gary studies his copy of the E-mail He looks vexed

GARY

DOJ AGENT
What dyou think you meant by it

GARY

The Agent shifts in his seat We get an idea of Garys
negotiating skill (making the other party look

unreasonable
while offering nothing)

GARY
Even when I had a hand in every aspect
of the company I knew the one thing
you can never control is somebodys
creative process
Gary seems sincerely contrite (He neednt be Milo
just
wants to please him Besides Milo sees hed like to
stop
obsessing about convergence to be a worldly
zillionaire
engrossed in his hobbies but after all what could be
more
engrossing than Skywire)

This seems to jolt her She pales a little What a
mysterious
girl But this only adds to her allure

MILO
Did I say something

LISA
No I know what you mean I used to
spend my life wishing people could
be like computers Least they make
sense Sometimes you think theyve
betrayed you Like a person would
But then you see no you just missed
a step You can go back and make it

MILO
(taken aback)
Nothing

Their eyes are locked Gary blinks sags into his
GARY
Everything I do is under scrutiny
The questions they ask trying to

Im confused Doesnt everybody in
business try to get ahead

MILO
(uncomfortable)

GARY

The purpose of this company isnt to
destroy our competitors any more

than the purpose of living is to
breath But the software business is
binary youre a zero or a one Being
obsessive isnt a crime Its a
character trait

What would it mean anyway If he

Have a look

MILO
Sure

Gary takes the page As he reads it over

GARY
Why did you move around so much
When you were a kid

MILO

-My dad was a compulsive gambler
Only he didnt think he was That
applied to guys who didnt have a
system Losers who played games
of chance He could read people
so chance had nothing to do with it
No matter how deep a hole he dug
himself hed give you the whole
speech And youd better not point
out the obvious

(he shrugs)
His creditors would catch up to him
Loan sharks or whatever Hed wake
us in the middle of the night Off
wed go again

GARY
What would you tell the kids At
your new school You had to come up
with a good story right

Milo thinks hes testing me

MILO
No I just went deeper into the
machine Preferred being the geek to
having to explain Lying wouldve
been worse

GARY
Worse

MILO
Cause he was a liar And I hated
him

(mimicking a voice)
Get your head out of that machine
wise up to the real world The more
he mocked me the deeper I went Cause
if being savvy meant being like him --
(he shrugs)
Guess thats why Im kind of clueless
even now Didnt cultivate my
conniving side Not sure I even
have one

GARY
Dont be so hard on yourself With a
brain like yours you could connive
with the best of em I bet

Gary smiles Theres no way to read it
EXT PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT

INT LIBRARY - NIGHT

Lisa and Milo sit together in front of a monitor A Kid
does

his homework on a computer at the next table Milo
shakes

his head as he scrolls

MILO
Hes buying up pretty much everything
cable companies baby bells picture
libraries museum rights film
archives Getting ready for Skywire

LISA
(shes thinking)
What about 60 Minutes

MILO
Yeah they dig stuff like this
(he types then reads)
CBS News has partnered with Outpost
Information Systems in a cable news
network due to launch Fall of 2001

LISA
But still you cant say CBS wouldnt
love to break something like --

MILO

(hes shaking his

head)
Say theres just one mole working
there like Barton at the DOJ How
do we know hes not the guy weve
contacted Or she Or the guy she
works for

At the next table she notices a Lady reading Time

LISA
Time
MILO

(types reads)
Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake
in Garys set-top device That also
takes out CNN

(scrolling and scrolling)
GE joins Outpost in new venture
which means NBC is out Disney joins
Outpost ABC is out Outpost and
Newscorp in new deal Fox is out
Any of these places could have a
mole Or all of em

(still scrolling)
Its like a a continuous loop We
can go to some alternative press
place that 1000 people read get
them and us killed But anything big
enough for this is a parent of ora
subsidiary to something Garys got a
finger in

HOMEWORK KID

Shhh

MILO
Sorry

LISA
Milo

Shes thought of something Hes watching the nerdy
Kid
smiling sadly perhaps identifying with him

LISA
How close are you

LISA
Hes got 12 satellites up Hes got
dishes on top of 21 Hes building

Move in on Milo as he thinks it over with a mixture of
excitement and skepticism

EXT LIBRARYPARK - NIGHT
Milo and Lisa walk in the park outside the library
thinking
it through

MILO
We cant just assume theyre standing
by to receive Skywire 12 months from
launch Id have to write in an aglet

LISA
A what

MILO
Its how on-line services push logos
they wanna sell you You dont ask
for em they just appear Have to
work on it somewhere besides my office
or my house And then the quality of
the broadcast wouldnt exactly be
digital thats 12 months away

LISA
But theyd still get the idea right

MILO
Youd have to design a graphic
interface to make the data pop Maybe
some audio too To tie it all in to
Gary How long would that take you

LISA
Its a standard GUI Once Ive got a
concept its maybe three days work

MILO
Gary knows Im close on Skywire We
have to do this fast

LISA
Before they kill somebody else too

MILO
(a new wrinkle)
Oh man Id have to get into Garys
house To get the satellite positions

LISA
You mean -- break in

MILO
I dont know --
the

LISA
And what if the broadcast dishes on
top of 21 arent hot yet You said
the place isnt finished

The complications pile up They walk They think

LISA
Ill go look
(when he looks dubious)
Theyll just have a few more pictures
of me snooping around

They come to a fountain and balustrade at the edge of
park stop walking

MILO
(looks at her)
Why were you so careless

LISA
I thought the worst they would do is
fire me Who knew they took
termination so literally

Gallows humor What a game girl Hes nuts about her

MILO
Why were you snooping in my office
LISA
Oh
(she gets bashful)
I liked you I was checking you out

He kisses her There are no constraints now theres no
adulterous guilt they kiss with a passion deferred

MILO
I told Teddy about you

LISA
Whatd he say

MILO
A beautiful geek Whatre the
chances

She smiles rather bashfully

MILO
I felt guilty Cause I owed so
much to Alice But even then I was
starting to wonder Is it so great
to be so consumed by this one thing
that you let another person do your
thinking for you If you have a
lucrative skill its all anybody
wants from you You grow older but
you dont grow up You turn into --
into --

LISA
Gary

Its painful for him losing a second father

MILO
Larry used to say how the guys who
wrote the first cool operating
systems like the UNIX guys at
Berkeley They just gave it away
They figured it was human knowledge
it belonged to the world like
Shakespeare or aspirin Know what
Im gonna do after we broadcast the
incriminating stuff Air the Skywire

tastefully decorated rooms are blending together

He stands in the center of the room making quarter
Through each of four (open) doorways he sees a
appointed den the ultimate expression of bland

professionally-decorated taste

Hes lost

He starts into one room -- backs up -- goes into
another

whispers in his ear We see Gary smile excuse himself

Guests who thank him for hosting such a brilliant

He flips the page begins entering the fixes for the

moves swiftly seems to know where Milo is

Her
face sets grimly
INT GARYS WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS
Milo clicks closing the window Concentrating he
doesnt
see what we see on the wall behind him the Mondrian
drains
away And the wall fills up with the hellish Bosch
triptych
After a moment Milo senses something
Gary stands in the doorway Watching him Milo doesnt
breathe Gary crosses the room eyes locked with
Milos
Gary comes behind Milo He reads the screen Its
filled
with text whatever Milo loaded in when he sat down
GARY
(reading the screen)
Dear Lisa Ive enjoyed working
with you Id be lying if I didnt
say I find you attractive But in my
heart I know that Alice
(he looks up)
You left my party to send E-mail
MILO
I couldnt do it at work cause of
security or at home for -- obvious
reasons
Gary stares at Milo He looks skeptical The party
music

floats in from afar as the moment stretches

GARY
You couldve handwritten it

MILO
Im not much good at handwriting Or
parties

GARY

Oh thats right Youre clueless

This hangs there
framed

Gary Im sorry if I was rude --

The Second Houseman sticks his head in

HOUSEMAN
Everything OK Mr Boyd

GARY
No problem
(when hes gone)
Is there

MILO
Gary I --

GARY
You see whats hanging on the wall

He looks over Milo looks over Among the framed
commendations awards degrees we see Milos childhood
program written on Outpost 10 Gary has had it

Milo absorbs it Even now he feels something for Gary

GARY
I hope you know what you mean to me
Not just because of what youre doing
Because of who you are

MILO
I do know Gary I feel the same
way I thought I was coming here for
a job But its meant a lot more
Milo smiles almost tenderly He doesnt know if Gary

it Perhaps if he could see Garys eyes But theyre

by Boschs writhing bodies reflected on his

Gary moves away from Milo he stands over the table
art books vaguely looks through one

GARY
When will you have a Beta version
carefully

Milo

and

Milo wonders does he know He picks his words

MILO
Im pretty close But when I wrote
the last contact switches it wiped
out a piece of the content filer
You know what its like writing
software

GARY
I do know You focus on the big
problem But somewhere down the chain
something breaks down Something
gets destroyed At first its
upsetting You feel youve lost
control

Gary puts down the book Something in his tone draws

GARY
So you have to remind yourself its
just the process Somethings always
lost along the way to anything
worthwhile Some little bug some
glitch Cant get bogged down in
that youre doing something other
people could never do They lack the
imagination the brain the nerve
Let them fret about every unforeseen
consequence You have to solve the
problem Thats who you are

Is this a confession A plea for understanding Or just

pep-talk to keep Milo focused on Skywire

EXTINT DRIVEWAYMILOS CAR - LATER

In the car Milo and Alice pull away from the lights

limos in icy silence Several beats

Are you gonna tell me where you went

MILO

MILO
To the artist

desperately to glance at his inner arm once more But

watching him waiting for him to eat

He picks up the chopsticks gathers up a tiny bite She
watches keenly He brings the food to his mouth passes

between his lips swallows
He closes his eyes ostensibly to savor the food in
bracing for a paroxysm
She watches him expectantly -- either for his verdict
food or for the first fatal spasm

turns over his arm to get a look face full of fear
