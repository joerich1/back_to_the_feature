ARTHUR CODY (VO)
America is not singular in the
hardships its faced but in its
perseverance despite them And
nowhere is this exemplified more
than New York where this countrys
destinies were forged Where kings
are crowned in the alleyways For
when I look upon these spires and
weaving neighborhoods I see not a
finality but a progress and it
fills my heart with such a quiet
sense of awe that I thank the lord

BRIAN LESPANE (FILTERED) (CONTD)
He was a titan of a bygone era A
luminary A former Hollywood star
whod survived two heart attacks
Often described as the embodiment
of the American male Codys life
was the stuff of legend But along
with his triumphs there were many
hardships and for the two time
widower few happy endings Perhaps
only the knowledge of legacy

not come without a price Few mens

This may not be the New York of

reckoning to that

This heard behind closed doors in

BRIEFING ROOM

Where Commissioner RAY DENIHAN flanked by his Lieutenants
MANCUSO and HODGES addresses a mass of NYPD DETECTIVES

DENIHAN (CONT’D)

Our initiative is crime on the
streets Its quality of life The
dope and the prostitution The
homeless in the parks and the
squeegee men at red lights For
this to kind of grass roots
campaign to be effective if we are
going to ask the everyday citizen
of our neighborhoods battling
poverty angered by gentrification
prone to small crime suspect of
corruption to ask these people to
hold themselves accountable to a
higher moral responsibility than
we must hold ourselves to those
same standards These demands can
only be implemented by a police
force whos honesty and reputation
is beyond reproach That is why you
are here today

Slowly now we push in on the Detectives

DENIHAN (CONT’D)

It is my belief that there are two
kinds of cops The Grass Eaters and
the Meat Eaters The Grass Eaters
being those of you who from time to
time take minor cash favors from
small business owners bodegas
ticketmen mostly under pressure
and influence of your superiors
And the Meat Eaters being the
opposite Those who take a much
bigger bite from considerably more
unsavory enterprises

Passing a Detective under his breath

DETECTIVE
Is this his campaign speech Hes
already measuring the drapes at
Gracie the fucking prick

Our focus continually narrowing in on the listener a single

officer in a back row A handsome face An air of class Of
education In stark contrast with his surrounding officers

(CONTTNURFD )

Hold on this man DETECTIVE RYAN HALAS

DENIHAN

We are hear to let you know that
before I leave this post the
curtain of dishonesty that has hung
for too long over this institution
will fall Those of you with
illicit pasts on the Bowery on
Narco details under Bob McGuire
investigation have already begun
and indictments will come down
Officers in this room will go to
jail

(hold on Halas)
Your friends are no longer among
the favored And my advice to you
today is get your house in order
because your names are on this
list and there are very few above
it And let it be known to those
among you the worst of the
offenders were coming after you
with a sledge hammer and we will
bury you

Hold on Halas an unbreaking calm

INT THE MAJESTIC - NIGHT

A CHANDELIER high above the audience lights this decidedly
anachronistic theater

And for tonights final
performance we invite you to
witness the final torrid hours at

The crowd howls

A gregarious audience of BANKERS and ARTIST around candle lit
tables of alcohol all watching the vaudevillian stage

where

ARTHUR CODY or rather a TRANSVESTITE dressed as the man in
heavy stage makeup sits in a rocking chair Piles of money
on the floor A shotgun by his side

thinks of his youth Vivian could

so generous

The audience howls

VIVIAN (CONTD)
Now what have I told you about

as she kneels before him and begins to service him It is
extravagant filth and the audience applauds while

Stuffs it into his bag

INT HALAS APARTMENT - NIGHT

His badge and his service revolver on a night table Halas
drinking considers them

DENIHAN (FILTERED)
This week with the passing of a
great New Yorker we are reminded
of the difficulties we now face

Ray Denihan on TV in Halas sparse apartment speaking from
outside the Precinct

DENIHAN (FILTERED) (CONT’D)

Today many Americans are facing

the toughest financial crisis of
their lives and the gap between
those with great means and those
struggling to provide the barest
necessities grows larger everyday
Well I say look to Arthur Cody as
exemplar

(CONTTNURFD )

His speech continues though Halas lamentations have turned
to a photo in his hands His stare bores straight through it

ANGLE ON

The photo shows Halas a young boy in his first suit leaning
on the hood of a gleaming Mercedes The place is somewhere
rural far from the city The look on his face is promise Of
someone whos just realized the whole world lies before him

DENIHAN (FILTERED) (CONT’D)
we need upstanding citizens like
Cody at our helm to remind us that
we all might thrive if this citys
promise can once again be a right
for all not a privilege for a few

APPLAUSE Halas decision is made

He is packing to run Only what he can take on his person
Only what hell need to start over Few clothes few precious
items his own personal PISTOL and rolls and rolls of cash
pulled from various hidden spots

He considers themnot nearly enough Puts them in his bag
Zips it shut A last look at his life when

THE PHONE RINGS AND RINGS Halas considers He answers

middle class Rich or poor Thats
all there is The middle is a wash

As Halas passes through the tables a ghost in the crowd he
notices TWO quite out of place FIGURES furtively heading to
the exit Halas zeroes inblood on the smaller ones hands

He pockets them and we see their faces for just a moment as
they look back at Halas Gaunt hard up Junkies

Just as quickly they are gone Halas a moment he heads for

INT THE PLAZA PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

Halas enters Mental notes of the whole scene The room a
plush suite Empty Park views The bed made

But here in the corner broken bottles Blood drips across
the carpet to the foot of the bed

Halas pulls back the comforter Blood stains on the sheet
The trail snaking to the bathroom Light on beneath the door

Quiet Halas breathes deep

Around him view from the window shows Central Park the
whole city laid out before him But the face that looks back
in the reflection is tired and sorrowful Empty He all but
sighs

Theres still hard work to be done He feels for his gun
Approaches the door

Outside the door

HALAS

He tries the door Locked

HALAS (CONTD)
Im gonna take you home Those men
are gone now Its just us Theres
nothing to be afraid of

A moment The sound of a chair removed the lock unhatched
Halas opens the door

INSIDE
Blood trails along the floor leading Halas to

The tub where the GIRL is crouched inside Shes small 14
or 15 Her clothes are tattered Her head held low
concealing the full extent of her damage though its
obviously substantial

She shutters as Halas approaches kneels Brushes back her
hair

Her face is badly beaten but despite it her features are
immaculate Bright and etherial and familiar This is ELLEN
GRAHAM Halas takes her in Then

HALAS (CONTD)
Where are the pictures Honey
(her hopes crushed)
Sorry kid Im sure its not fair
Its just the way it is

She takes a moment Cold reality setting in but she stays
silent

Halas scans the room The vanity the garbage the toilet

He pops them open Nothing Removes the lid from the top of
the toilet Here Inside an envelope

He retrieves it While we dont see the contents he does
Its something to be valued

HALAS (CONTD)
Come on Ill take you home

(CONTTNURFD )

ELLEN
Home Youre the police
(beat)
You dont look like it

nerves broken hearts

ELLEN

Halas doesnt answer Drives on Her eyes going wide as they
pass St Marks St

Hey you just passed

The Marquee for THE PEARL STREET THEATER slipping behind
them

ELLEN (CONTD)
You just missed it That was my
stop
(Halas is silent)
Where are youwhere are we going

Rightfully she grows concerned as she watches her
neighborhood pass away She puts her hand to her mouth
Holding back tears

ELLEN (CONTD)
Were not going home

HALAS
Shh Just a little further Were
almost there

Ellen steels herself Hides the coming tears

EXT THE SEAPORT - NIGHT

Halas car rolls beneath the as yet undeveloped docks
Shadows throw long from the overpass above Halas knows the
lay of the land He parks deep in one of them and gets out

He moves around to Ellens door She tries to hold it shut
but hes too strong He lifts her out

Ellen is led to the waters edge Brooklyn factories hazy
across the river

They stop in the quiet darkness She shakes

HALAS
Shh Its all right

Unsheathes his gun

ELLEN

Please You dont have to do this
You dont have toLook I have
money

(bills from her pocket)
Take it I dont want it Its
yours

(hes unmoved)
Wait I can tell you things I can
make you rich I know things about

pictures I know who has it all
More than youd believe More

She looks him in the eye They seem untouched Hollow

ELLEN (CONTD)
(at the end of it)
We had a deal And theyI swear
I never meant for it to be like
thisoh god Please Please
Please I dont want to die

Halas cocks the gun A creature of habit He raises the
barrel to her head

HALAS
Shh

AndA SOUND SOMETHING SHATTERS in the street

They freeze Footsteps slapping away a distant FIGURE
passing beneath a street light

(CONTTNURFD )

Halas turning back to herthe money pushed back into his
hands

ELLEN
Please Youre not a bad guy I
bet I can tell You could just let
me go No one would know Id never
say a word

I could be really nice to you

Finally Halas looks at her Shes just a kid He tilts her
head to the light The wounds on her face

ELLEN (CONTD)
(toughening up)
Ive had worse

HALAS
How old are you

ELLEN

(then)

HALAS
Im old enough to be your father

ELLEN
Never stopped him

Halas looks at her A turn He hands her back the money

ELLEN (CONTD)
I dont want it
HALAS
Take it Its the best youre going

ELLEN

(collecting herself)
It was never about money you know
It never was

(then)
You wouldnt believe me if I told
youNo one does

(finally)
Where will I go

(CONTTNURFD )

HALAS
I dont care Away But you can
never come back
(she nods)
Dont make me have to find you

A last look and she runs off along the water Her footsteps
scampering away till shes gone

Halas watches her walks back to his car Slams the door

The most lavish home even built on the Manhattan island
National media assembled outside its gates Fog rolls up from

French manicured sculpture gardens and marble watering pools
occupy the entire block Evidence of what once existed all

at the boom of the century

HALAS FORD TEMPO travels the long straight drive to the

KURKON (CONT’D)
Thank you Ryan

Halas the castle before him The folder beneath his arm He
steels himself

KURKON (CONTD)
Be careful what you wish for
right

Halas ascends the stone stairs leading him onto

A great elevated courtyard leads toward the house Passing
fountains and extravagant topiary all built to out do some
rival millionaire Halas stops at a modest area just off the
shadows of the house

A cemetery A collection of unassuming grave markers date
back a century

And Halas pauses to consider them The names on the humble
stones are unfamiliar Benjamin LewisWilliam Humphrey
but the dates which are interesting Halas leaning in to
read

Born 1895 - Died 1901 Born 1884 - Died 1889 They are
all children As Halas considers one stone a small marble
cross No name No date A closer look

He turns to greet SINCLAIR head of the family servants

As Sinclair gestures the way to the house

Now he waits in the cavernous foyer Gilded ceilings
Masterworks on the walls He watches a servant unfurl a white
sheet and drape it over a credenza All about SERVANTS are
shutting down the house packing up Packing things

Vivian Lake appears
VIVIAN

Sorry to keep you waiting

Detective Things areits a busy

A last look but shes already leading him off
INT THE MONROE STAHR PRIVATE LIBRARY - NIGHT

Vivian smoking peruses the pictures with little reaction
Silence

In person shes more human though glamorous in a way that
hardly exists anymore

Halas attempting an air of cool indifference waits among
the cloaked white sheeted furniture

For a long time shes silent

HALAS
Mrs Lake

VIVIAN
(indicating the photos)
Have you seen them
(Halas nods)
And what did you think

HALAS
They were none of my business

Vivian smokes

(CONTTNURFD )

VIVIAN
Weve never claimed to be the
picture of domesticity That was
them I suppose its very naive of
me but I still believe that
peoples private lives should
actually be private

HALAS
You may be the last of that breed

She stamps out her cigarette Lights another She offers one
to Halas He accepts Considers the lighter shes handed him

VIVIAN
It was my fathers You want it
Im ready to be rid of all of it

He lights his cigarette hands it back

VIVIAN (CONTD)

She ashes

VIVIAN (CONTD)

HALAS
Im not looking for money

VIVIAN

Mr Halas --

HALAS

VIVIAN

I have friends who can be quite
persuasive If thats the way you

HALAS
I dont know that

VIVIAN

or two

HALAS
Im not looking for a handout I
dont want to run I just want
fresh start

VIVIAN
Of course I cant promise you
anything but Ill try

HALAS
I imagine you can be pretty
persuasive

At this moment CHARLES LAKE totters into the room and the
two-year-olds sudden appearance is like an apparition
Golden haired he bobbles in carrying a Teddy Bear

Vivian gathers her child up in her arms

Her husband now appears in the doorway He wears a rough
night but JOHN LAKE still cuts an immaculate figure

JOHN
He wont sleep I got him up but he
was calling for his mother

JOHN (CONTD)
(Pause Then realizing
Halas presence)
Oh - excuse me I thought you were

(CONTTNURFD )

VIVIAN

A beat John exchanges Good Nights and retreats from where
he came A moment

Halas now aware of his location The presence of this
family of this child

VIVIAN (CONTD)
You thought hed walk on water

Let me show you to the door

As they approach it Charles in tow Vivian hesitates

VIVIAN (CONTD)
Its a difficult time for us you

HALAS

recognize the passengers as the men seen leaving the Plaza

align stacks of 100 dollar bills inside One after another

That fortune is prepared on a desk catalogued by TREASURY
ACCOUNTANTS They record the bills serial numbers onto a
list pass the stacks along

John Vivian Denihan watch the proceedings stoically Halas
with wide eyes until Margraff appears in the doorway
Gestures were ready for you

Halas follows him out
Passing through police presence in every corner in the house

The library converted to a conference center Phone lines
Switch boards manned taking calls

The living quarters now decked with cots for 40 men The
kitchen bustling to prepare meals for the platoons

Lt Mancuso and Hodges oversee the operation in the Garage
where a dozen gleaming vehicles have been invaded by Police
Here they take statements from Witnesses Faux confessors
Neighbors all seeking their entry into the Lakes orbit

Halas led past

BOOKISH OFFICER
NO NO NO We need at least a
semblance of order here Now
whered you say these are from

A dozen OFFICERS occupy a desk which at this moment is
inundated with letters Now multiplied as hundreds more are
spilled from a mail sack by ANOTHER OFFICER

A beleaguered BOOKISH OFFICER tries desperately to sort them
MAIL SACK OFFICER
Uhmm -- that batch was from

Westchester I think -- wait Maybe
Far Rockaway

(CONTTNURFD )

The Bookish officer begins to sort them Agitated

LIBRARIAN
Do not do that next time Weve got
to keep these separated Please

MAIL SACK OFFICER
(walking off)
Im not a fucking mail man

He exits the great commotion which is now the Lakes house
leaving the Bookish officer the arduous task of sorting the
piles and piles of letters The lot of them in one variation
or another they all read - VIVIAN LAKE

Margraff finally pulls him away toward an idling vehicle A
CHAUFFEUR waits Its Sinclair the butler

MARGRAFF

I dont want to know why you were
called up here I dont know what
deal you cut with them before but
youve been giving a second chance
here Remember that son Play it
straight Youll find people much
less forgiving this time around

Halas steps into the car Off the slam of the door

The police scene is all ready assembled Police cars sirens
block the roadway As Halas hesitantly approaches the edge

when they fished her out Now maybe
the clothes come off in the water
but Id bet someone took em off

her biceps)

town house door reads RUSSIAN BATHS

INT 10TH ST RUSSIAN BATHS - DAY

Immigrant bearded faces look up as Halas rolls silently
across the lobby his badge extended

A swarthy MAN behind the counter gestures to a descending
staircase in a far corner Halas nods heads toward it

DOWNSTAIRS

The schvitz in an old town house populated by OLD JEWS
RUSSIANS the occasional leering QUEER Conversations of
politics and business MURMUR the groups

The oppressive heat hits Halas in the face His clothes cling
damp All eyes falling upon this stranger among the towelled
glistening men

He scours their faces bringing conversations to a halt All
coy advances stopped Their attentions instead to his raised
badge To the heated metal of his gun as he patrols past

Silently from room to room From face to face In each no
sign of Trudy No sign of suspicion until

THE RUSSIAN ROOM

Halas opens the door to scalding heat All voices fall dim
at the sight of him in the stone room except for

VOICE
--come on man 20 bucks Just
twenty bucks Im good for it You
know Im good for it--

This too now silent The desperate voice from the small
scant man in the corner now withdrawing his pleading hand
from the thigh of a large sopping Bear

His hands up at the sight of Halas dripping in the doorway
The gun leveled upon him TRUDY LITTLE

TRUDY
Oh god Dont shoot

MAIN ROOM

Halas leads Trudy at an arms distance by the scruff of his
neck past gaping eyes Trudy remains stoic

But as they ascend the stairs his future closing in on him
he breaks into sobs Halas pushes him forward

MAIN FLOOR

As they reach the landing the arriving costumers and swarthy
COUNTERMEN watch confounded at the captured prisoner

HALAS
(to the counter)
Call 911 Tell them its Detective
Halas for Captain Margraff in the

He picks up the phone Trudy blubbers through tears
TRUDY
Cant I at least get my clothes on
I dont want them to all see me
like this Dont make me go out
there like this

As Halas considers the door rings as new costumers enter
Freeze at the odd spectacle

In the brief confusion Trudy breaks for the stairs
No chance to shoot Halas goes after him
Trudy bolts up steps toward the second floor Halas at his

heelsto the landing Trudy stops nowhere to run Hands
raised passively backing away as Halas approaches

(CONTTNURFD )

TRUDY (CONTD)
Im sorry Im sorry I swear I
never meant to hurt him

Halas cracks Tackles Trudy into the wall Pounds him with
rib shots Punishing defenseless blows

FACES peer out from the MASSAGE ROOMS which line the hall
witness the beating then just as quickly retreat to their
indiscretions behind closed doors

Halas unable to stop Demolishes the dismal figure

Finally he pulls away Blood on his hands Trudy Little in
a rumpled mess bleeding sweating onto the floor

I wanna--I wanna speak to -- I
wanna talk to John Lake

your privileges but there is a
limit to it Arthur Cody allowed me
to achieve things I couldnt have
He was not a populist but he cared
about this city He gave me clout

EXT MARBLE CEMETERY - NIGHT

Cautiously he enters The gate leads Halas through a narrow
passage way cut between two buildings Finally giving way
to

The graveyard is wrapped by stone walls secluded from the
city in the center of a block Its tombs mausoleums
monuments spread across an idyllic rolling lawn It is
tranquil and utterly withdrawn from the city around it

At the far end of the pasture SEVERAL DARKS FIGURES gather
by a tomb

Halas hands on his gun He creeps closer to hear
VOICE
All right Thats good Set it down
right there

He approaches the gathering Vivian and John lay the money
out before Robert Price

disappeared into the night

Vivian SCREAMING after him John lying in her arms

EXT 2ND AVENUE - THAT MOMENT

A strange pulse on the street Empty though WILD SOUNDS are
heard in the distance Far ahead huge crowds are seen
tramping north up the city

Halas searches Nothing Then a shadow dashing beneath a
street lamp Halas pulls his gun Too late Robert is gone
Following the crowds

Deep breath Halas takes off Sprinting after him toward

Illuminated by spotlights crisscrossing the increasingly
drunk and agitated crowd Ghettobirds hover overhead The

Clutching the trunk in his arms sprinting up 2nd Avenue
where PROTESTORS stream in all directions flooding the
streets near the park

He quickens his pace to join the mob then enters it Checks
over his shoulder then slows to the march of the crowd and
blends in Disappears

ANGLE ON HALAS

Reaching the crowds at a sprint A running COPS RADIO
SQUAWKS as he blurs past Halas

Repeat

In the flowing streets Halas searches the faces heading
toward the park Young and old artists and junkies No sign
of Robert till

A face looks furtively back There he is dipping out of the
crowd into an alley and vanishes

Halas pushes through the mob after Robert
EXT ALLEY - NIGHT
Robert gripping the money to his chest walks quickly

beneath the dark fire escapes where a group of KIDS prepare
MOLITOV cocktails behind a dumpster

HALAS gun drawn turns into the mouth of the alley The
parade of protestors passing behind

Ahead Halas sees the BOYS behind the dumpster though no
sign of Robert

(CONTTNURFD )

HALAS
(to the boys)
Which way

They shrug Though a wad of bills sticking from a LITTLE GUYS
pocket betray their sincerity

Halas moves deliberately ahead toward where the shadow of a
doorway where

ROBERT waits with out breathing A gun clutched to his chest
Hands trembling as the shadow of Halas slides toward him
along the alley way Finger on the trigger He waits

HALAS eyes caught up ahead at a glimpse of the teeming
TOMPKINS PARK steps now to the opening of the doorway when

VOICE
What the - the fuck are you kids
you doing

Halas turns to see

The MOLITOV kids discovered by a group of PATROLMAN who now
push them up against a wall

COPS
You little shits

And commence to WAILING AWAY at them The kids are pummeled
as a bottle drops off the dumpster crashes to the crowd and
explodes Sending a burst of flame alighting the alley way

For a moment Halas is wide-eyed Till he turns back toward
the doorway andits empty

ROBERT running toward the alley opening

HALAS giving chase as the two men come into full view of
THE TOMPKINS SQUARE RIOT

The spotlights crisscrossing the park where a full scale riot
is now underway No barrier now Police entangle with angry
protestors Cuffs are slapped on Beatings are delivered

We find Margraff holding back witnessing the fray Bad
vibes Until a bottle cracks across his back He staggers

stands Breaks Attacks the first thing he sees

pavement asa single HORSE loose from his rider tramples
up the street in a spooked panic gallops passed him up and
turns a corner Robert watches it go transfixed then

HALAS
Hold it Robert Dont move

Halas gun at his head approaches Robert is still Its
done He drops the money down and raises his hands Halas
carefully approaches removing his cuffs as suddenly the
CROWDS storming from the avenues envelope them filling a
gap between the two men

Robert a chance at freedom He looks to the money on the
ground Then to Halas No choice he takes off into the park

Halas gives pursuit into the storm

EXT TOMPKINS PARK - SAME

On the empty flophouse floor Kate lies in pooling blood
Several feet away so does Robert The final shot to own his
head And there in the corner Charles throne vacant tossed

side ways on the floor The baby fallen to the ground

The OLD WOMAN screams again Halas silences her and
approaches the baby He kneels before him and picks him up

A beat The baby cries Alive
And Halas removes the mask from his face

OLD WOMAN

The Eaglet is unharmed As the woman puts a hand to her
mouth

Voices now climbing up the stairwell

DENIHAN (CONT’D)
You either run now or you own it

Faces already crowding the open doorway Openmouthed at the
crime scene Then at the baby A flashbulb goes off

MURMURS

As the voices grow louder up the stairs hold on Halas

INT EAST VILLAGE FLOPHOUSE - NIGHT

In the stairwell neighbors crowd the doorway as Police push
up the stairs keep back Everyone keep back

They hardly notice Halas as he squeezes from the room and
heads down the crowded steps alone

EXT EAST VILLAGE ALLEY - NIGHT

Pull out to the street where ambulances and crowds from the
park have converged pushing into the building

Passing through the pandemonium moving against the tide is
Halas

We pull out from him a small figure in the massive swell of
the city

EXT TOMPKINS PARK - LATE NIGHT

The park smolders now vacant of protestors in the predawn
light The last few Police cross the debris of the park
escorting cuffed participants toward waiting ambulances
paddy wagons Police Sirens pull off into the night

Here we find Halas sitting beside Margraff polishing off a
bottle of Jameson in the empty park They laugh at something
private

MARGRAFF
And they know
(Halas nods)
Save it for a rainy day
(they laugh)
You can start over with me any day
you choose

HALAS
How far back can you take me

They laugh Margraff makes the sign of the cross
MARGRAFF
My child I do believe you are a
man
With that a last drop and Margraff tosses the bottle

shattering into the street among a hundred others Walks
away Halas alone on the bench
