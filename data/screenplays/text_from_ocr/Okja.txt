INT CEO OFFICE MIRANDO COMPANY HEADQUARTERS MANHATTAN -
AFTERNOON

SUBTITLES 10 years ago 2006

An expansive modern CEO office Late afternoon sunlight
pierces the 74th floor of the Mirando Company The companys
green tree logo covers one of the walls

A woman stands at the window her back filling the SCREEN
She looks down at the lesser Manhattan skyscrapers This is
LUCY MIRANDO (40s)

On the window are arrows pointing at the various Mirando
subsidiaries scattered throughout Manhattan Mirando Organic
Harvesting Mirando Peachy Delight Baking Company Mirando
Chemicals Mirando Tenderloin Fine Dining Supplies Mirando
Biotech Mirando Hungry Pirates Burgers Mirando
Transformatives Mirando Happy Pups Good Boy Treats

Lucys breath mists over the arrows She mumbles to herself
in a small voice practicing some kind of speech

A hand reaches in - holding a cosmetics brush - and begins to
gently brush Lucys face

From 0S a spray of HAIR SPRAY coats Lucys hair

WIDE Lucy is surrounded by a MAKEUP ARTIST a HAIR STYLIST
and MIRANDO COMPANY EMPLOYEES including Lucys senior
assistant FRANK DAWSON MAKE-UP WOMAN
Im a huge fan

Lucy looks at her surprised

MAKE-UP WOMAN (CONTD)
Of your Tenderloin Fricassee ready
meal

They both glance at an ADVERTISING POSTER framed on the wall -
a photograph of a FARMER gently stroking a cows face The
slogan THE SECRET INGREDIENT IN OUR TENDERLOINS TENDERNESS

MAKE-UP WOMAN (CONTD)
So whats all this about The
reporters out there

FRANK
Ms Mirando doesnt want to have a
conversation right now dear
LUCY
(Smiling)
Its okay Frank Im not my
sister
(To the Make-Up Lady)
I am announcing a miracle

INT CONFERENCE ROOM MIRANDO COMPANY HEADQUARTERS - DAY
The conference room is packed with REPORTERS and TV CREWS

A spotlight shines on a small potted tree in the corner of
the stage It looks uncannily similar to the Mirando Company
logo

Lucy stands on the stage Shes charismatic modern maybe
slightly vulnerable The sight calls to mind a Steve Jobs
product launch or Gwyneth Paltrow delivering a TED talk

LUCY
On a Spring morning three years ago
a Chilean farmer named Senor Victor
Zamora Villacorta was tending to
his pigs when he chanced upon
something very strange

A beat Lucy has the reporters attention Lucy outstretches
her long graceful arm and clicks on the touchscreen behind
her

A PHOTOGRAPH fills the screen of a CHILEAN FARMER posing for
the camera He looks wise old kind - straight out of
Chilean Farmer Central Casting

LUCY (CONTD)
I recently had the opportunity to
meet with Senor Villacorta at his
hilltop farm

Each time Lucy says Senor Villacortas name she does so with
a slight Chilean twang

LUCY (CONTD)
We sat out on his porch and drank
wine as the sun went down

Another PHOTOGRAPH appears on the screen this time of Lucy
and Senor Villacorta drinking wine at sunset A picture-
perfect rustic setting

LUCY (CONTD)
He said the sweetest thing to me
Lucy

(MORE)
LUCY (CONTD)

Why couldnt this miracle have
happened forty years ago when I was
looking for a wife I could have
married a supermodel Well Im
sorry Senor Villacorta It turns
out we dont choose when we get to
save humanity

Lucy makes a peculiar hand gesture The words Saving
Humanity appear on the screen in hundreds of languages in
various styles of calligraphy

LUCY (CONTD)

(urgently)
The worlds population is at seven
billion 805 million of our fellow
humans struggle with hunger each
day including 30 million right
here in the United States

A PHOTO-MONTAGE of WORRIED-LOOKING HUMANS from across the
globe fills the screen behind Lucy They look lost helpless
in need of a leader

LUCY (CONTD)

And by 2050 Well somehow have to
feed a staggering 96 billion
people The world is running out of
food and we are not talking about
it We needed a miracle And then
we got one - on Senor Villacortas
little hilltop farm

The lights dim Music swells

LUCY (CONTD)
Say hello to Mary

A photograph fills the screen of Senor Villacorta cradling a
VERY ODD-LOOKING PIGLET in his arms The room falls silent as
the fascinated Reporters stare at the very odd piglet

LUCY (CONTD)
All the other piglets in the litter
were normal But this peculiar
little lady turned out to be about
the least normal thing you can
imagine Our scientists at the
Mirando Ranch in Arizona have been
raising Mary with love and care
ever since observing her and
performing various studies And I
can tell you the results right now
(MORE)
LUCY (CONTD)
(Beat)
Mary is like nothing on earth

FRANK watches Lucy speak from below the stage He quietly
mouths like nothing on Earth in time with her

LUCY (CONTD)
And so please welcome to the stage
the inspirational Senor Victor
Zamora Villacorta

SENOR VILLACORTA walks onto the stage and stands in his
predesignated spot Hes dressed in his full farmers outfit
Theres a smattering of dutiful applause from the reporters

SARCASTIC REPORTER
Uh no offence to Senor

LUCY
Villacorta

SARCASTIC REPORTER
But wed prefer to see the pig

LUCY
(Smiling)
You will But not yet

BRITISH REPORTER
Youre announcing the birth of the
worlds most amazing pig and youre
not showing us the pig Youre a
temptress

The British reporter gives Lucy a sleazy misogynistic grin
Lucy responds with a mock-scolding look

BRITISH REPORTER (CONTD)
(Winking)
Youre much more fun than the last
Chief Executive

LUCY
Of course I am Peter Yes shes
my sister but Nancy and I are very
different human beings with very
different business ethics Very
different The only thing we share
is our last name

Lucy smiles but her composure is slightly rattled A
question from the audience ends the brief silence
REPORTER C
Whats so great about this pig

anyway

LUCY
She has an impressive reproduction
rate

The Reporters look underwhelmed

LUCY (CONTD)

(A small smile)
A regular sow averages five or six
piglets in a litter and two litters
in a year Mary has mated with one
of our best hogs while she’s been
living with us in Arizona and
she’s had a few piglets Would you
care to see them

Lucy makes a hand gesture A FILM fills the screen of A
HUNDRED very odd-looking piglets grazing the beautiful

grassy acres of the Mirando Ranch

A beat while the reporters take it in Then the room ERUPTS

with a volley of QUESTIONS and CAMERA FLASHES

Under the stage Frank SMILES This is going exactly to plan

SARCASTIC REPORTER
How the hell did one pig have so
many babies

LUCY
(Beat)
She got big

The reporters take in the implication

LUCY (CONTD)
And her babies are going to get big

too
REPORTER B
Show us a picture of the big pig
LUCY
(Smiling)

Simon Patience Last week we sent
twenty-six of Marys Super Piglets
to the twenty-six countries around
the world where our Mirando branch
offices are located

The screen behind Lucy becomes a colorful world map Through
cool graphics we see the Super Piglets being spread to New
Zealand Brazil France Sweden Spain Germany Denmark
South Korea Japan South Africa and so on

LUCY (CONTD)
Each piglet was given to an
esteemed local farmer

A PHOTOMONTAGE of SUPER PIGLETS being handed by MIRANDO
EMPLOYEES to charismatic-looking FARMERS in picture-perfect
locations Faces of all shapes and colors A testament to the
global nature of the project

LUCY (CONTD)

I have asked each farmer to raise
their special guests in a natural
environment with the utmost care
honoring traditional techniques
unique to their respective
cultures My top scientists at the
Mirando branch offices will be on
hand to offer whatever support is
required

(beat)
And now we have a competition

On the word Competition the colorful world map reappears on
the large screen behind Lucy The faces of the Local Farmers
appear over the map

LUCY (CONTD)

These little piggies will be the
forebears of a whole new species
From these we’ll pick the most
exceptional specimens and develop
them into a super breed A
revolution in the livestock
industry And one local farmer will
rear the biggest and most beautiful
and special one The Ultimate Super
Pig But which farmer will it be
Will Denmark win New Zealand
Thats my bet But Im no expert

(beat)
But I know someone who is The
judging panel will be led by none
other than the wonderful Dr Johnny
Wiseman - TV’s most popular
zoologist and veterinarian - and
the new face of the Mirando
Company

The reporters are taken aback
REPORTER
Johnny Wiseman’s working for
Mirando now

LUCY
Let’s remind ourselves of Dr
Johnnys work

The screen behind Lucy fills with a MONTAGE of famous clips
from the HUGELY SUCCESSFUL TV show DR JOHNNY’S MAGICAL
ANIMALS

A GORILLA throws straw in DR JOHNNY’s face Dr Johnny
laughs uproariously Dr Johnny lies underneath an ELEPHANT
washing its underside The elephant takes a shit on Dr
Johnnys face Dr Johnny shrieks with laughter Dr Johnny
cuddles a Panda

Throughout it all we hear upbeat music - MAGICAL MAGICAL
ANIMALS

The MONTAGE ends

LUCY (CONTD)
(to the screen)
Oh Johnny
(to the reporters - a
little chilly)
Hes just hilarious

REPORTER
How did you get Johnny Wiseman
working for you

SARCASTIC REPORTER
Deep pockets right

LUCY

(smiling)
Were just delighted to have him

(beat)
When the competition reaches its
climax Dr Johnny will crown the
winner at a Magical Animals live
telecast right here in New York
City THATS when well unveil our
Super Pigs to the world And
believe me itll be worth the
wait

Senor Villacorta is still standing on his spot - awkwardly -
nobody paying him any attention
REPORTER
How long will the wait be When do
we get to see the big pigs

For a beat Lucy looks like she doesnt know what to say
Then she recovers

LUCY
Ten years

ELDERLY REPORTER
Ten years Jesus Christ Ill be
dead by then

BRITISH REPORTER
This has to be the longest beauty
contest in world history If it was
Miss America all the girls would be
old and ugly by the end Theyd be
putting the crown on the head of a
wizened old hag

The sleazy British Reporter grins and looks around pleased
with himself for his joke Frowns from a few of the female

reporters

LUCY
I dont think 10 years is a
terribly long commitment given
that we’re developing an entirely
new scientifically ground-breaking
species that will single-handedly
remedy the planet’s food shortage
crisis Our super pigs will not
only be big and beautiful theyll
be designed to leave a minimal
footprint on the environment
consuming less feed and forage
producing less excretions But most
importantly

Lucy creates a long expectant beat

LUCY (CONTD)
Theyll need to taste fucking good

A Pig-Faced Reporter blurts out

PIG-FACE
Goddamn right

Lucy and the other reporters laugh The atmosphere is merry

Frank laughs and claps loudly as music begins to flow through
the speakers - The Isley Brothers HARVEST FOR THE WORLD

-All babies together everyone a seed half of us are
satisfied half of us in need Loves bountiful in us
tarnished by our greed when will there be a harvest for the
world

LUCY
Ten years Thats when therell be
a harvest for the world Thank you

Words drift across the screen The Super Pig Project
‘Saving Humanity ‘Harvest for the World’

INT BATHROOM HALLWAY MIRANDO COMPANY HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Lucy Mirando slumps on the toilet with a cigarette in her
mouth sans makeup She is web-searching articles on her
cutting edge 2006 flip phone Press photos of her dancing to
“Harvest For the World” pass through the screen She begins
mouthing words to herself We dont know whether shes
reading the article or reliving her speech

The phone begins to ring and the name Nancy Mirando flashes
across the screen in bold letters Lucy debates whether to
answer before shutting it

CUT TO

Lucy washes her hands in front of the mirror She feels
something behind her and turns around to find Frank
awkwardly holding out his phone

LUCY
What is it

FRANK
Its Nancy
(looking at Lucy)
She said you werent answering

LUCY
(hushed voice)
Are you working for me or her
Jesus Frank

Lucys outburst barely affects Frank who stares back with an
innocent face Lucy takes the phone

LUCY (CONTD)
Hey sis Hows London

A LONG SILENCE We hear Nancy breathing down the phone

LUCY (CONTD)
(beat)
Are you angry

Another hard silence

LUCY (CONTD)

(trying to keep it light)
Come on Nance Dont be angry
Talk to me

NANCY (VO)
(finally)
I think Denmarks going to win

LUCY

(happily)
Really Why do you think Denmark

A small cold chuckle from Nancy

LUCY (CONTD)
Are you mocking me Please dont
mock me

(beat)
Nance

NANCY (0S)
Yes Luce

LUCY
(awkwardly)
What I did today Do you think
Dad would have liked it

NANCY (VO)
Oh Lucy sweetheart Poor darling
Dad would have thought you were a
total cunt

CUT TO
Lucy walks out of the bathroom and hands the phone to Frank
waiting by the door An EXTREME WIDE SHOT of Manhattan
skyscrapers We see Lucy as a small dot as she walks down the
infinite hallway

MAIN TITLES

TITLE OVER BLACK OKJA

The STREET NOISE and sounds of AIRPLANES are replaced by
meditative SOUNDS OF NATURE - the mountain breeze and
chirping birds

DISSOLVE TO

EXT MOUNTAIN - DAY

A thick forest sits at the foot of a mountain range that
stretches for miles

SUPERIMPOSE TITLE The Present Day 2016

SUPERIMPOSE TITLE South Korea

When the TITLE disappears we notice a tiny white dot moving
in the woods far ahead A person An animal

EXT WOODS - DAY

A SMALL GIRL carefully climbs down the hill a straw sack
over her shoulder her face a mix of street-smart
stubbornness and innocence She is MIJA

We hear BUSTLING behind her - and see a VERY LARGE and VERY
STRANGE-LOOKING ANIMAL unsteadily tiptoeing down the hill It
is a fully grown SUPER PIG - OKJA

Okja clumsily makes her way down the hill looking terrified

She steps on a thorny chestnut bur and immediately freezes
She looks back and forth between Mija and her foot with a
blank expression She looks silly - the hugely oversized
creature with her foot daintily raised

Mija immediately runs over and plucks the chestnut bur from
Okjas foot Okja blows through her nostrils in relief still
wearing the same blank expression She is awesome in size
but slow and doesnt appear very intelligent

EXT PERSIMMON TREE WOODS - DAY

From atop the hill Mija looks down at a tree in the bottom
It teems with ripe orange persimmons

MIJA
Go

On Mijas command Okja enters frame and runs downhill
towards the tree But she trips over her feet and begins
tumbling and tumbling until

Sshe hits the tree trunk THUMP The tree is nearly pulled
out of the ground Ripe persimmons fall everywhere

Okja raises herself unfazed by the impact Mija scuttles
down and gathers the persimmons in her straw sack She picks
up the largest one and throws it to Okja who snaps up her
chin and catches it like a dog catching a tennis ball

CLOSE ON Okjas silly innocent face as she moves her
humongous jaws savoring the juicy persimmon

EXT STREAM - DAY

Mija peers into the water She looks up and waves at Okja
(OS) - indicating a part of the stream where the water is
deepest

Suddenly Okjas colossal body fills the SCREEN as she flies
across the air toward Mija She splashes into the water
sending a mini-tsunami in all directions

Like when an obese person jumps into a small tub copious
amounts of water and FISH flow over the banks The fish flap
around frantically Mija quickly picks out the larger ones
puts them in the sack and throws the little ones back into
the stream Quick and efficient A familiar routine

With her eyes and nostrils barely poking out of the water
Okja takes a leisurely swim Mija takes off her clothes and
jumps in They swim under the blissful autumn sunlight An
idyllic moment It feels like time has stopped

Okja suddenly climbs onto a large rock She shakes off the
water like a dog and tightens arching her body Her large
ears point up in a peculiar fashion Mija catches the
signal

MIJA
No Wait

Okja glances at her and freezes Mija quickly swims upstream
until - at a safe distance - she gives Okja the OK sign
with both hands With that

Okjas epic pooping begins

It is similar to the pooping of hippopotamuses Okja spins
her short tail like a helicopter as she projects fecal matter
in all directions A spectacular scene with countless pieces
of shit flying across a wide radius The excrements fall in
the water and fish gather around the pieces to feed on them
The ‘circle of life in full effect

Okja jumps back in the water and the fish gather around her
bottom They swim gracefully as a school chasing after
whatever is left behind by Okja

EXT NEAR THE STREAM - DAY

Okja is sprawled on a rock next to the stream taking a nap
Mija sleeps on Okjas belly moving up and down every time
Okja takes a breath Whenever Okja shifts Mija adjusts
somehow maintaining her position on the belly

We notice a small BLACK BOX the size of a cell phone attached
to Okjas ear

EXT MIJAS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Mijas grandfather HEE BONG carries firewood getting
ready to make dinner The sun is falling fast Hee Bong looks
toward the mountains with concern

HEE BONG
(Shouting)
Mija Where are you

EXT STREAM - CONTINUOUS

Hee Bongs voice echoes through the mountains Inside Mijas
straw sack half-submerged in water a fish peeks through the
chestnuts and persimmons still breathing

Mija jolts awake She looks around blankly before realizing
she slept too long She shakes Okja awake Okja spreads open
her humongous jaws and yawns

MIJA
(to Okja)
Were late for dinner Well take
the short cut

Okja responds with a distinctive SQUEAL

EXT TRAILCLIFF - DAY

The short-cut is narrow and borders a steep incline Mija and
Okja hurry down it Mija notices that the rope around Okjas
neck is hanging limply off her She turns to re-tie it
suddenly SLIPS and FALLS down the incline the rope in her
hand She slides towards a SHEER DROP

She grabs a nearby scrub which holds her for a moment then
SNAPS in her hand She continues sliding the cliff edge
approaching sharply

Okja looks blankly down Then she suddenly steps on her end
of the rope Mijas plummet abruptly STOPS She dangles
precariously over the cliff - her life barely preserved by
the tip of Okjas foot

Okja lowers her enormous snout toward the rope trying to
pull Mija back up with her mouth But her mouth and tongue
are large and unwieldy Okja struggles until - in a sudden
move - she twists her neck and successfully bites the rope
But as she does she loses balance and begins sliding down
the incline

Still desperately holding onto the rope Mija immediately
drops several feet in the air Then she suddenly STOPS

She looks up and sees Okja peeking over her having slid all
the way to the edge of the cliff The rope is tightly
stretched between them Large drops of drool escape through
Okjas fiercely clenched teeth and fall onto Mijas body

With an emphatic umph Okja steps backwards the rope in her
mouth She somehow manages a few strenuous steps But then a
rock that had been anchoring her foot suddenly comes loose
and she begins sliding again

Mija SCREAMS as she goes into a free fall Okja shrieks too
as she slides towards the SHEER DROP

Suddenly Okja spots a large tree stump below With the rope
clenched in her mouth she twists and steers her body towards
the stump Right before reaching the edge she coils herself
and jumps over to the other side of the stump

Okja FALLS OFF THE CLIFF But the rope hung over the stump
forms a pulley mechanism And so - as Okja dives headlong
with the rope in her mouth - Mija is pulled up by Okjas
weight

As Okja falls and Mija rises they lock eyes at the midpoint
A fleeting moment of desperate longing sadness

When Mija reaches the tree stump Okja unclenches her jaws
and lets go of the rope - PLUMMETING towards the woods below

MIJA
(Screaming)
OKJA

Okja plummets further until shes swallowed up in the green
leaves Mijas heart breaks as she watches Okja fall after
saving her life

MIJA (CONTD)
OKJA

There is no answer from below

EXT FOREST BELOW THE CLIFF - DAY

The forest is densely packed with trees Mija desperately
searches for Okja but she is nowhere to be found

MIJA
OKJA

The echo dies out and the forest is once again silent We
only hear the BUZZING of insects and the CHIRPING of birds
until

we hear a huge FART from somewhere in the woods Mija
quickly turns toward the sound She sees Okja through the
trees - casually chomping on grass completely unaffected by
the fall Mija runs over with a huge smile happily swinging
the straw sack on her shoulder

MIJA (CONTD)
Okja Are you okay

Mija checks everywhere on Okjas body for injuries As she
does Okja slowly slinks to the ground and lies on her back
She lets out a MOAN and pretends to be hurt while she
continues to chew on the grass She holds up her rear foot
and begs for attention like a little child Mija looks at
her foot

She sees a fresh scar near Okjas hip blood oozing from it
She picks out a ripe persimmon from her sack and peels it
She takes the soft inner part and rubs it gently against
Okjas wound The soft moist sensation soothes Okja and she
slowly closes her eyes Her chewing slows as well

MIJA (CONTD)
You like that

Okja MOANS in pleasure

MIJA (CONTD)
You saved my life Again

Okja SQUEALS in response

It looks like theyre really talking to each other Mija
holds up Okjas large floppy ear and whispers something We
cant hear what but the soft whisper combined with the late
afternoon sunlight leaves us with an achingly beautiful
feeling Okja nods as if responding to whatever Mija said

EXT MIJAS HOUSE - EVENING

CLOSE ON a dinner table Wild greens potatoes boiled eggs
pan-seared fish in the middle Its the fish Mija caught at

the stream earlier Hee Bong and Mija sit in the living room
and chow on the dinner

HEE BONG
(out of the blue)
Uncle Mundo says hes coming by

tomorrow
MIJA
To collect the money For Okja
HEE BONG
I already sent the money to the
company
MIJA

Right So Okja is ours now
Hee Bong nods Mija smiles

MIJA (CONTD)
So why is Uncle Mundo coming
Paperwork

Without answering Hee Bong turns away and switches on an
ancient tube television A soccer game is on

HEE BONG
Damn The first half is almost
over

The screen blinks on and off with static Hee Bong slaps the
side of the set making it normal again With his eyes on the
soccer match he picks up his spoon to eat when the screen
blinks and dissolves into static again

HEE BONG (CONTD)
Son of a

MIJA
Great Now we can buy a new TV

Hee Bong goes over to the TV He raises his hand to strike it
again when BUZZ The screen returns Its as if the TV is
afraid of Hee Bong

HEE BONG
This ones perfectly fine

MIJA
(pouting)
Such a tightwad

Behind Mijas disgruntled face we see Okja poking her head
out of the shed to drink water from the bucket Hee Bong
retrieves a half-drunk bottle of soju and opens it He
carefully pours the soju into the cap and with trembling
hands lifts the tiny cap brimming with soju

INT MIJAS ROOM - LATE NIGHT
Its silent except for the sound of insects

We see the picture frames on the wall A story spanning ten
years

Theres a Mirando Certificate with Hee Bongs picture printed
on it It reads in English Congratulations farmer HEE BONG
Raise your Super Pig with love and care Love Lucy Mirando

Theres 6-year-old Mija hugging her Super Piglet

Theres 12-year-old Mija tightly hugging the fully grown
Okja

Mija sleeps with a comic book open in front of her A sound
wakes her up She looks toward a tiny window in the corner of
the room The window opens directly to the shed where Okja is
kept

We see Okjas massive butt through the window She keeps
shifting her tail bothered by the itching in the wounded
area The tail is too short and hardly reaches the wound

Mija picks up a back scratcher from the floor She attaches a
long bamboo stick to the end and sits in front of the tiny
window She yawns as she pokes the stick through the window
and scratches the area around Okjas wound

Mija begins to doze She closes her eyes

EXT STREAM MOUNTAIN - DAY

MUNDO PARK hikes up along the stream covered in sweat
Dressed in a suit and tie he carries a bag that bears the
Mirando Korea logo He stops for breath and looks down the
mountain behind him He takes out his phone The signal is
poor and he holds up his phone at various angles before
finally getting a bar and dialing

WOMANS VOICE (0S)
Hello

MUNDO
(Into the phone)
Where are you Whats taking you so
long

WOMANS VOICE (0S)
(Out of breath)
Were all so out of shape And Dr
Johnny is being somewhat

difficult
MUNDO
(Surprised)
Dr Johnny But hes so much fun on

WOMANS VOICE (0S)
(Thinly)
Right On TV But not in the water

MUNDO
Water

WOMANS VOICE (0S)
He dove into the water saying he
couldnt stand the heat Now he

(quietly)
Aw disgusting I think he’s doing
a secret piss

EXT FRONT YARD MIJAS HOUSE - DAY

Hee Bong stands at the faucet and pours water into a bucket
He turns off the faucet almost as soon as he turns it on
Still thinking he poured too much he pours off a little into
the basin before handing the bucket to Mundo Mundo gulps
down the water thoroughly covered in sweat

Mija washes Okja in the front yard

HEE BONG
(quietly)
I thought a bunch of you were
coming

Mundo glances down the hill

MUNDO
Theyre coming

MIJA
(calling over)
Its nice to see you Uncle Mundo
Why are you here

Mundo steals a glimpse at Mija

MUNDO
(silently mouthing)
You didnt tell her

Hee Bong looks away without answering Mundo looks
frustrated He walks over to Okja Mija claps and gives a
sign to Okja who obediently sits on the ground Mundo
removes the small black box on Okjas ear and unlocks the
waterproof casing He opens it to reveal various computer
chips and SD card slots

He removes the SD cards and plugs them into his laptop
Numbers and graphs showing data about Okjas health abound on
the screen Blood Pressure Temperature Heart Rate
The clean design-conscious interface of the Mirando Super
Pig HealthGrowth Management software

Mija looks over Mundos shoulder lustily eyeing his brand
new Macbook when

We suddenly hear someone SHOUT in English

JOHNNY
Fuck me
(panting)
All right Im here Im fucking
here goddamn it

Hee Bong Mija and Mundo all turn their heads A large man
struggles up the steep incline bitching and moaning all the
way This is Dr JOHNNY WISEMAN

MIJA
(eyes wide)
Its that guy From TV

She runs excitedly to Hee Bong - leaving Okja at the back of
the yard

MIJA (CONTD)
(to Hee Bong)
Its him right From Magical
Animals

JOHNNY
You
(panting)
You just had to
(panting)
drag me all the way up to this
fucking mountain top

MIJA
(To Hee Bong)
He came to meet Okja even though
she isnt in the competition any
more He must think Okja is that
special

Mundo looks uneasy

Johnny suddenly notices Mija Then he is abruptly back to his
panting and bitching

JOHNNY
All the other Super Pigs were on
flat land accessible by car
Japans Super Pig was about a five
minute drive from the airport I
notice that you leave the fucking
mountain top Super Pig to the end
because you knew the climb would
rile me Well guess what Im
riled

Johnnys companions stand around awkwardly Theres JENNIFER
the Marketing Director from Mirando HQ (30s American) She
wears a DSLR over her neck And theres a Korean TV crew -
CHANG the cameraman and CHOI (26 female) the
interpreterassistant

Choi looks back and forth between Johnny and Hee Bong trying
to smile the awkwardness away

JOHNNY (CONTD)
Well can someone at least bring me
some water Given that I am about
to be filmed for fucking
television

Choi RUSHES over to the faucet and begins to pour

JOHNNY (CONTD)
Not sparkling water I dont want
to belch my way through the
broadcast

CHOI
I dont think they have sparkling
water here
(to Hee Bong)
Excuse me sir if you dont mind
Dr Johnnys a bit thirsty from the
hike

But Johnny spots Hee Bongs green soju bottle He stomps over
and snatches it up

JOHNNY
Soju

Before Hee Bong can react Johnny cracks open the bottle and
downs the soju in one swig

HEE BONG
Ah I was saving that

Johnny lets out a refreshed drunken sigh Hee Bong looks on
devastated Mija stifles her laughter

Johnny spots Okja for the first time As he does his
personality changes totally - he looks INCREDIBLY EXCITED

JOHNNY
There she is

CHOI
This is Okja

JOHNNY
Shes wonderful

He rushes over to Okja and begins caressing her body This is
real touching enthusiasm

JOHNNY (CONTD)
(softly)
Just perfect
(furiously to Chang the
cameraman )
Well fucking film me You cant
fake these emotions

CHOI
(yelling at Chang)
Film him

Chang hurriedly switches the camera on and dances around
fishing for the right angle Jennifer snaps away on her DSLR

JENNIFER
(to Choi)
Get him his doctors coat

Choi hurriedly retrieves a white doctors coat from her bag
It has the Mirando logo emblazoned on it She scurries over
to Johnny and helps him into it

Johnny continues to caress Okja - her well-developed muscles
faultless skin and taut curves his expression one of awe

JOHNNY

(to the camera)
Ten years ago twenty-six local
farmers in twenty-six far-flung
countries were each given a super
piglet This year Ive traveled to
each of the twenty-six farms to
meet the Super Pigs and decide
which one will be invited to the
BEST SUPER PIG FEST in New York
City where theyll be unveiled to
the world

MIJA
(to Hee Bong)
Whats he saying

JENNIFER
Shhh Theyre filming

Johnny looks at Hee Bong with sincere respect giving him a
big thumbs up

JOHNNY
Youve done an incredible job

Hee Bong doesnt need a translator to understand He holds up
his thumb Jennifer is ecstatic This is exactly what she
wanted

JENNIFER
(to Chang)
Pan from Johnny to the old man

CHOI
(to Chang)
Pan

Chang pans from Johnny to Hee Bong

JENNIFER
(to Johnny)
This is it The moment of mutual
trust between Mirandos very own
Dr Johnny and the esteemed local
farmer

JOHNNY
(to Hee Bong)
Shes truly exceptional

HEE BONG
(a thick Korean accent)
Ssank you so much

JOHNNY
How did you do it What was your

Johnny winks at the camera
JOHNNY (CONT’D)
(dramatically)

Jennifer Two medals please

Chang pans to Jennifer as she takes out two Best Super Pig
medals and hands them to Johnny

Johnny puts one medal over Hee Bongs neck and another over
Okjas neck

Okja BLOWS in Johnnys face covering his face with drool
Johnny responds with his trademark UPROARIOUS LAUGH

JOHNNY (CONTD)

festival in New York City

MIJA

Jennifer hands another medal to Johnny Johnny walks over to
Mija
JOHNNY (CONT’D)

Pig too in her own special way

Johnny ceremoniously puts the medal over Mija’s neck

JOHNNY (CONTD)
Get some cutaways of the pig

Chang dutifully does After hes gone Johnny talks quietly
to Mija

JOHNNY (CONTD)
Im sorry I was kinda grumpy when I
first arrived on your farm Being a
television presenter can be
stressful

Mija looks blank - she has no idea what hes saying

As Chang gets cutaways of Okja Mundo tries to squeeze into
the frame

JENNIFER
Hey No

With a hand gesture Jennifer shoos Mundo out of the shot

Mundo lingers awkwardly He walks over to Hee Bong and
WHISPERS something in his ear

JOHNNY
(still talking to Mija)
I always have to be on
Especially now I find myself the
‘face of the Mirando Corporation
How did that even happen

Hee Bong grabs Mijas hand and takes her to the corner of the
yard

MIJA

HEE BONG

dad up there

MIJA

HEE BONG

Hee Bong pulls the reluctant Mija uphill

HEE BONG (CONTD)
(pointing to the group)
Theyll be here for a while Come
on

EXT CEMETERY - DAY

The sun shines on two burial mounds lying side by side in the
quiet woods Hee Bong and Mija pluck weeds and dust off the
tombstone

MIJA
I cant remember their faces

Hee Bong looks at Mija with pity He sighs

HEE BONG
Its been so many years Just the
two of us living here in the
mountains

MIJA
(cold)
Not two Three

HEE BONG
Sure Okja too Our little fatty

Silence Hee Bong takes out a box from his pocket and opens
it Inside the box is a gold pig the size of an adult fist
Mija regards it quizzically

MIJA
Whats that

HEE BONG
A gold pig 100 real gold

Mija confused

HEE BONG (CONTD)
So pretty dont you think In the
old days the elders would give this
gold pig to their daughters as a
wedding gift Take it Its yours

MIJA
Why are you giving me a gold pig

Hee Bong hands the gold pig to Mija He points downhill with
his chin

HEE BONG
Well youre not getting married
but since Okja will be leaving
us and going far away You can

keep this gold pig instead of her

MIJA
What

Mija stares blankly with the gold pig in her hands still not
understanding

HEE BONG
Theyre here to take Okja

MIJA
Okja

HEE BONG
Yeah The competitions nearly
over So theyre taking all the
Super Pigs back to the company

HEE BONG

(nods )

(laughs)

Pacific

Hee Bong lets out an exaggerated laugh as he carefully
searches for Mijas reaction Mija is in utter shock

HEE BONG (CONTD)
(sternly)
Mija Youre nearly a grown woman
and to be honest I wasnt too keen
on seeing you playing with that pig
all day You should go to the town
maybe meet a boyfr

Mija throws the gold pig at Hee Bongs foot and rushes down
the mountain

EXT MIJAS HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

Mija runs out of the trees and arrives at the house to find
it completely empty The dirt in the yard is wildly printed
with footprints We can picture how Okja must have been
dragged away The hairs stand on Mijas body

MIJA
OKJA

Mija shouts at the top of her lungs Her voice echoes along
the massive ridges of the mountain but goes unanswered Mija
begins to run - with the urgency of a sprinter

EXT FOREST - LATE AFTERNOON

Mija runs down the mountain with great speed and athleticism
having grown up roaming these hills She runs her legs off -
through the trees over the rocks and through the air across
the stream The branches scratch and scar Mijas face but she
continues running gaining speed

But Okja and her escorts are nowhere to be seen

EXT BEGINNING OF HIGHWAY - SUNSET

Mija stands at the point where the highway begins She looks
far ahead at a sedan and a large container truck - just dots
Mija breathes heavily exhausted from her run A tear forms
in her eye The truck containing Okja rounds the bend and
disappears to the other side of the mountain

INT MIJAS HOUSE - NIGHT

CLOSE ON a large cauldron sitting on top of a fire hole
steam rising from it Hee Bong opens the lid and we see a
whole chicken inside the boiling water Hee Bong adds
cinnamon ginger and vetch to the pot He hears someone
entering and pokes his head out of the kitchen He sees Mija
crossing the yard limply eyes swollen from crying and cheeks
streaked with dirty tears Mija stomps past Hee Bong and
towards her room scattering the chickens away

INT MIJAS ROOM MIJAS HOUSE - NIGHT

Hee Bong pokes his head inside the room He carefully opens
his mouth

HEE BONG
You must be hungry I made your
favorite - chicken stew

No answer Mija cant seem to put a stop on her emotions
She sobs as she undresses Hee Bong becomes embarrassed and
turns his head but Mija doesnt care She continues to take
off her pants and her socks

HEE BONG (CONTD)
Go clean up and lets have some
chicken stew

(MORE )

HEE BONG (CONTD)
I put in all the herbs that are
supposed to be good for you

Mija continues to sob as she removes a training suit from her
drawer She puts it on along with fresh socks Hee Bong looks
at her curiously Mija takes out a red fanny pack from the
drawer

HEE BONG (CONTD)
What are you doing

Mija still doesnt answer Her face is a grotesque mess of
tears and snot She puts the fanny pack around her waist

HEE BONG (CONTD)
Where do you think youre going

MIJA
Seoul

HEE BONG
What

MIJA

Im going to bring Okja home

HEE BONG
Are you crazy Seoul In the middle
of night Do you even know how much
it costs to go to Seoul

Mija picks up a large piggy bank from the top of the chest
She raises it high and throws it to the floor with surprising
strength The piggy bank shatters into pieces unleashing a
vast sea of coins Hee Bong gasps

Mija continues to sob as she sweeps the coins into her fanny
pack and pockets There are a few bank notes in there too
She bites them between her lips

Hee Bong comes into the room and tries to stop her but Mija
throws him to the floor

Hee Bong has had enough He stands and begins frantically
shoving the coins under the furniture with his feet He looks
ridiculous And its pointless Mija has already filled her
fanny pack She zips it up and heads fast towards the door

HEE BONG (CONTD)
Dont you dare leave this room

Mija turns and stares at him

HEE BONG (CONTD)
Look I miss Okja too

Mijas eyes instantly swell with tears at the thought of
Okja

HEE BONG (CONTD)
But shes an animal They all have
to go sometime

Hee Bong grabs a permanent marker from Mijas desk and starts
drawing lines over the photograph of Okja - the one where
shes being hugged by Mija With rough strokes he divides
Okjas body parts like a butchers meat chart

HEE BONG (CONTD)
Blade shoulder loin spare rib
hock This is what she is

Mija cries even louder - this is deeply disturbing to her
She pushes Hee Bong away and runs out into the windy front
yard

Hee Bong runs after her and manages to grab her
MIJA
(yelling)
No
As Mija yells the bank notes she was biting between her lips
accidently fly away in the wind Hee Bong instinctively
throws himself toward the money

Mija uses the opportunity to run away dashing into the dark
woods

Hee Bong belatedly realizes his mistake and runs after her -
but she is GONE He breathes heavily as he stands in the
black windy forest the bank-notes clenched in his fist

HEE BONG
MIJA -

Hee Bongs voice echoes throughout the woods Instead of
Mijas answer

A cacophony of CITY NOISES begin to crowd our ears

INT SUBWAY TRANSFER TERMINAL SOMEWHERE IN SEOUL - DAY

As the NOISE reaches a crescendo we see a wide staircase
filled with SUBWAY PASSENGERS transferring between lines

Black heads filling the SCREEN move in a single direction
One of the heads turns and looks around - Mija

INT PLATFORM SUBWAY STATION - DAY

Mija stares hopelessly at the large subway map on the wall
The subway lines are intricately spun like spider webs They
resemble Mijas tangled hair and her utterly confused state

She somehow identifies her destination on the sprawling map
and takes out a coin from her fanny pack inserts it in the
ticketing machine The fanny pack is a promotional gift from
Mirando Mija makes note of the Mirando Korea address and
phone number printed on the inside

EXT ENTRANCE MIRANDO KOREA OFFICES - DAY

A white clean interior brightly lit by fluorescent lights
Mija stands up against the glass door and peers inside We
see an empty front desk with the Mirando logo and a potted
tree that has the exact silhouette of the logo

The lobby is silent until CLICK CLICK A skinny
RECEPTIONIST clicks her high heels into the lobby and returns
to her seat

Mija tries to make eye contact but the Receptionist looks
down at her smartphone and doesnt look up Mija - feeling
invisible - KNOCKS on the glass

The Receptionist finally raises her head and sees Mijas wild
appearance She points to a guest phone attached to a stand
in front of the entrance

RECEPTIONIST
(mouthing the words)
Use the phone

Suppressing her anger Mija picks up the receiver and presses
the call button We hear upbeat music as the automated
voice speaks in KoreanEnglish

AUTOMATED VOICE (VO)
Welcome to Mirando Korea If you
would like to know the number of
the department you are looking for

Mija holds the receiver with both hands

MIJA

AUTOMATED VOICE (VO)
Sorry I did not hear you Please
clearly state the name

Mija screams her lungs off hoping the Receptionist will
notice her frustration The Receptionist gets up and casually
walks into the back office

MIJA
(yelling)
Wait

The Receptionist disappears without answering The front desk
is empty again

Mija closes her eyes and takes a deep breath to calm herself
She suddenly begins walking backwards She spins the fanny
pack to her side and fully zips up her training suit She
stands at the opposite end of the long hallway staring at
the Mirando Korea entrance Suddenly

She begins to run

She charges ahead with explosive speed Upon nearing the
entrance she accelerates even more and throws herself into
the glass door

THUMP Mijas body collides with the door and the entire
glass wall vibrates from the tremendous impact

The door remains intact while Mija bounces off and tumbles on
the floor

BEEP BEEP The security system is activated The
Receptionist hurries out to the lobby She sees Mija on the
floor MOANING

RECEPTIONIST
(startled)
Oh my God Are you okay

Looking down at the fallen Mija the Receptionist presses the
button of the automatic door The moment she does a spider
web begins to spread on the glass and soon the huge glass
door begins to come down in a cascade of shards

The Receptionist SCREAMS as tiny sharp particles pour onto
the floor Mija immediately leaps up and charges into the
office bumping into the Receptionist on the way The
Receptionist grabs onto the tree that looks exactly like the
Mirando logo as she tumbles onto the floor Dirt pours out of
the pot revealing the bizarre-looking root of the tree We
realize it was a plastic tree all along

INT MIRANDO KOREA OFFICES - DAY

Mija runs frantically down a MAZE of LONG EMPTY FLUORESCENT-
LIT CORRIDORS Its creepy and corporate - the stuff of
conspiracy theory nightmares

MIJA
(yelling)
Uncle Mundo Okja Mundo

The maze finally opens into a large brightly lit office
She sees rows and rows of desks - BUT NOT ONE EMPLOYEE

She runs through the cubicles looking around

MIJA (CONTD)
(yelling)
Uncle Mundo Okja

MIJAS POV

A poster on the wall advertising Mirandos Super Pig
project The copy ‘Harvest For The World accompanies a
picture of hundreds of fully grown Super Pigs feeding on the
grassy acres of the Mirando corporate Ranch in Arizona

To Mija the sight is deeply unsettling Its like seeing
hundreds of Okjas

At that moment we hear a SQUEAL Is it the real Okja

Mija runs toward the sound but is caught by an ELDERLY
SECURITY GUARD She throws him off sending him into the
ground Now its the RECEPTIONISTS turn She leaps at Mija -
but Mija evades her with great athleticism jumping over
desks and cubicles

Mija runs into a conference room and locks the glass door

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Mija runs to the window
MIJAS POV

A PARKING LOT invisible to the outside world Mundo and
UNIFORMED MIRANDO EMPLOYEES are dragging a chained and roped
Okja towards a large trailer

The Mirando uniforms are surprisingly BRIGHT and COLORFUL and
VIBRANT looking

Okja is desperately resisting - but to no avail

EXT PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

The OFFICE EMPLOYEES have vacated their desks to form a
gallery in the parking lot Theyre all busy taking selfies
with Okja in the background

The Employees reluctantly lower their selfie sticks

Its like the scene in The Graduate where Ben bangs on the
window at the wedding - Elaine Elaine - except Mundo and
the Mirando Employees dont notice Mija The glass is too
thick and soundproofed We can see shes yelling but they
cant hear a thing

Mijas eyes are alight with fury The Security Guard and the
Receptionist are unlocking the door when Mija charges toward
them and throws herself at the door knocking them to the
ground

With fierce determination Mija runs toward the elevator

EXT TRAILER - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

As the Uniformed Employees struggle to tie the violently
resisting Okja in place Mundo puts his face against Okjas
and raises a selfie stick He makes his best cute face as he
takes a picture

INT CAB MIRANDO TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER
Mundo climbs in the passenger seat

MUNDO
(To the driver)
Lets go

The driver is KIM The truck begins to move with a huge
roar Mundo scans Kim up and down suspicious Slight frame
baby face distracted eyes Something about him is just
off

MUNDO (CONTD)
Youve got a commercial drivers
licence right

KIM
(Nonchalantly)
Huh

MUNDO
A licence to drive a heavy goods
vehicle A Class A truck

Kim smiles blankly without answering He steers the truck
roughly out of the parking lot and into the outside world

As he does we see Mija bolting out of the main entrance

EXT STREETS NEAR MIRANDO KOREA - DAY

Mija runs with wild desperation as the truck disappears into
the distance But it soon slows down to merge onto a larger
road and Mija accelerates with all her might until she
reaches a point where the road continues downhill but the
sidewalk remains level with the buildings She runs alongside
the truck until

She boldly jumps and - THUMP - lands on the roof of the
trailer

INT TRAILER MIRANDO TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

THUMP Okja looks up at the sound She SQUEALS and hikes up
her head The Uniformed Employees also look up curiously
Okja can feel Mijas presence above her She touches the
ceiling with her face as she continues to SQUEAL

EXT TRAILER ROOF MIRANDO TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Mija balances herself on the moving trailer Through the
fluttering strands of her hair she sees an overpass
approaching

INT CAB MIRANDO TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Mundo sees the overpass It seems very low He looks over at
Kim who drives still looking blank

MUNDO
Whats the height of this truck

Kim gives Mundo a listless nonchalant look
KIM
Uh they did tell me it was
uh

Still Kim doesnt slow down

The overpass approaches fast The sign that indicates the
height comes into view 42 meters

Mundo stares at Kim

The truck blasts through

approaching This time the sign reads 39 meters

Kim slowly shakes his head and indicates his foggy memory

shrivels his body like a squid on a grill

EXT TRAILER MIRANDO TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

As Okja SQUEALS Mija runs toward the back of the trailer
The overpass is about to slam the back of her head when

-Mija jumps and hangs onto the rear door handle of the
trailer

SPARKS fly as the trailer roof scrapes against the underside
of the overpass The horrible sound of metal scratching
against concrete Mundos scream and Mijas shouting
overwhelm our ears at once

Dangling from the handle Mija BANGS on the rear door of the
trailer

INT TRAILER MIRANDO TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

The Uniformed Employees stand up to investigate the banging
when they get caught between Okjas massive body and the
trailer wall They scream in pain as Okja twists her gigantic
body towards Mija

Mija and Okja cry for each other

MUNDO
What was that noise

But Kim is preoccupied by something different - something
VERY STRANGE occurring 0S His eyes widen

MUNDO (CONTD)
(Beat)
What

Mundo follows Kims startled stare to the side of the truck

MUNDO (CONTD)
(yelling)
TERRORISTS

A black semi is driving purposefully alongside the Mirando
truck The two occupants - both staring at Mundo - are
wearing BLACK SKI-MASKS One wears a SUIT underneath the
other a casual JACKET

JACKET
(broken Korean)
Im not terrorist Nice meet you

But his strange accent along with the wind noise and roar of
the trucks engines make it impossible for Mundo and Kim to
understand him

MUNDO
What

JACKET
I dont want hurt you I dont like
fighting Stop car

MUNDO
(to Kim)
What the hell are they saying

JACKET
I said I dont like fighting Come
on guy Just cooperate
(to the Suit)
Shit Fucker doesnt even
understand my Korean

The Suit just looks at the Jacket - his eyes are a curious
color

The Jacket rolls up the window He fixes his ski mask and
abruptly turns the handle SLAM

The black semi rams into the side of the Mirando truck
Mundo screams like a girl

The Mirando truck gets sandwiched between the black semi and
the underpass wall Sparks FLY

Nearby DRIVERS react with horror as the two mammoth trucks
duel Horns blare everywhere

Amidst the chaos the Suit never loses his composure
remaining cool silent

The Jacket abruptly turns the steering wheel and delivers the
final blow The Mirando truck smashes against the wall

The violent shaking makes Mija lose her grip on the rear door
handle She tumbles onto the asphalt and screams in pain

The cars behind her screech and turn to avoid her - adding to
the chaos

The Mirando truck is finally forced to a STOP

The black semis trailer door opens and FOUR more people
dressed entirely in black and wearing ski-masks come running
out - although ONE of the four is noticeably THINNER and
SLOWER than the others They carry various tools One carries
a bolt cutter

The Uniformed Mirando Employees open the trailer door and are
immediately ambushed by the Black Assailants

The Assailant with the bolt cutter severs the chains binding
Okja to the trailer The Mirando employees watch him
compliantly

Mundo and Kim are trapped in the cab - sandwiched between the
wall and the black semi Mundo desperately tries to open the
door

The Suit leaves the black semi and walks towards Kim and
Mundo They watch his approach with curiosity He begins
shaking a SPRAY PAINT CAN in his hand

He sprays black paint onto the spotless white front end of
the truck He seems to be writing something

MUNDO
What the

But Kim finds the whole situation amusing

MUNDO (CONTD)
Are you smiling

KIM
(Nonchalantly)
Im just watching the destruction
of Mirando property

Kim laughs

Behind the truck the Black Assailants drag Okja towards
their trailer

Okja desperately looks around for Mija But she cant see her
anywhere

Traffic is at a standstill DRIVERS in the opposite lane have
stopped their cars to take pictures and record video of this
bizarre sight

Suddenly among the pileup of cars a girl ARISES It is
Mija She limps to a car and climbs onto its roof Her body
is covered in grazes but she is undeterred

She takes a deep breath and blows hard on her WHISTLE Okja
suddenly turns her head as she is being dragged away

Okja and Mija finally see each other

Despite her injuries Mija dashes toward Okja But Okja
cannot move The Black Assailants have her locked down with
ropes

Okja tips her body and rolls over the Black Assailants They
scream - crushed by the weight

Okja and Mija beeline toward each other They REUNITE
OVERJOYED Like a gunslinger jumping onto a running horse in
a Western Mija grabs the rope tied to Okjas body and
swiftly jumps onto her back

Okja pulls an abrupt U-turn and runs toward the open road
with Mija on her back

The Suit gives a hand signal to the Black Assailants They
regroup under the Suits command and board the truck They
chase after Okja

MUNDO
(To Kim)
Follow them

KIM
(mumbling)
Fuck it What do I care I’m
leaving this shit country soon

MUNDO
What did you say

KIM
(pulls keys out of
ignition and tosses them)
You know what I DO have a
commercial driving license but my
temporary contract doesn’t cover me
for workplace injuries

Everything finally makes sense for Mundo He opens the door
and runs out

MUNDO
You want a workplace injury
compensation package

Mundo starts RUNNING in the direction of Okja

MUNDO (CONTD)

(Over his shoulder to Kim)
Then you’d better start showing
some LOYALTY to this COMPANY And
THIS IS WHAT COMPANY LOYALTY LOOKS
LIKE

As Mundo proudly yells this he loses his footing and SLAMS
into a PARKED CAR - knocking himself UNCONSCIOUS

EXT UNDERPASS EXIT - MINUTES LATER

The point where the underpass joins the open road Okja runs
at full speed with Mija on her back while the black semi
chases them quickly closing the gap The Uniformed Employees
belatedly join the chase carrying tranquilizer guns Mundo
holds onto his head as he tags along

MUNDO
(to the Uniformed
Employees )
Hurry your asses up Whoever gets
them first Ill recommend for a
permanent contract With full
welfare benefits No bullshit

The Uniformed Employees consider this and look at each other
awkwardly But only momentarily as they start running at full
speed

We see police cars approaching from across the intersection
with sirens blaring Mija quickly changes direction and rides
Okja toward an underground passage

INT UNDERGROUND PASSAGE UNDERGROUND SHOPPING CENTER

Okja enters the passage and stumbles down the concrete steps
She’s never climbed stairs before and is anxious about it
PEDESTRIANS scream and scatter at the sight of the giant pig

MIJA
Sorry Get out of the way

The Suit the Jacket and a few of the black assailants
follow Okja into the underground The Pedestrians panic even
more at the sight of threatening men in ski masks The
Uniformed Employees follow in with tranquilizer guns adding
to the pandemonium

INT UNDERGROUND SHOPPING CENTER - CONTINUOUS

SHOPPERS and SHOP OWNERS scream in horror Shoes makeup
clothes and mannequins are blasted into the air as Okja blows
past

A PART-TIME STUDENT dressed as a PINK PIG distributes flyers
in front of a newly opened snack bar decorated with colorful
balloons Dance music blares in the background

He sees the enormous pig hurtling toward him He begins
running for his life - the huge pig face still over his head
As he runs he desperately fishes for an angle with his
smartphone - trying to film a video of Okja and himself

As Okja makes a sudden turn her foot gets caught ina
clothing rack jutting out of the corner She falls on top of
glass plates displayed before the adjacent store A loud
CRASH Mija is thrown off Okjas back landing head first on
the floor

The Jacket breaks from his group and rushes to Mijas side
propping her up Mija looks dazed from the impact

JACKET
Hey You okay

The Suit turns around to see Uniformed Mirando Employees
aiming their tranquilizer guns at Okja

He picks up one of the panels displayed in front of the
nearby frame shop The tranquilizer dart flies through the
air and sticks on the panel THUNK The other assailants also
pick up panels and the subsequent barrage of darts all fall
on panels printed with the images of celebrities

While the Uniformed Employees hurriedly reload their guns
the Suit gives a quick hand signal to his group The black
assailants begin charging toward the Employees like
terrorists in an ambush

The Suit calmly walks over to the injured Okja and grabs her
ankle He is caring as he touches Okja having a natural ease
around animals He immediately locates the broken piece of
glass lodged in Okjas foot He quickly and painlessly plucks
it out - like when Mija removed the chestnut bur from Okjas
foot back in the mountains

Mija watches impressed

Kim searches ALF on the Google browser of his
smartphone He looks at the spray-painted ALF on the
front of the Mirando truck

INT UNDERGROUND SHOPPING CENTER

Instead of answering the Jacket lifts his t-shirt and shows
Mija a TATTOO - a balaclava-wearing angel-winged Animal
Liberation Front member embracing a lamb in his arms

Mija stares blankly at the tattoo as POLICEMEN come running
from the opposite end of the passage with tear gas guns
drawn

The group - along with Okja and Mija - stand and run The
police give chase

The Jacket sees a passage that leads to a garage He directs
the other members towards it and shouts into the phone

INT UNDERGROUND GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

The group bolt out of the door just as the black semi speeds
toward them from the opposite side

The back doors of the trailer are already open and Mija jumps
in first She gives a sign to Okja who climbs in with great

difficulty The ALF members push Okjas behind with their

combined strength Again ONE seems frailer than the others

Once Okja is inside the Assailants climb aboard

The Police finally arrive and haphazardly fire their tear gas
guns but to no avail The black semi speeds away the back
doors still swinging open the policemen running pathetically
after them

Suddenly a man squeezes through the group of Policemen and
leaps to the front with tremendous speed It is none other
than MUNDO with the UNIFORMED MIRANDO EMPLOYEES running
behind him

Mundo chases the semi with fierce determination The ALF
members watch with mild curiosity

Okja suddenly bends her body and perks up her ears as she
turns to Mija Mija stares in disbelief

MIJA
Now

Mija sighs

MIJA (CONTD)

Well I guess youve been holding

it in for a long time
Mija gives Okja the sign
Okja begins pooping The scale is beyond epic
Her tail spins like a propeller as she unleashes a veritable
‘shit storm Mundo has nearly closed the gap when hes
BOMBARDED with countless pieces of shit

Two ALF members look on as Mundo cries in horror

ALF MEMBER 1
I never tire of the way they shit

ALF MEMBER 2
Could watch it all day

leaving Mundo a dejected shit-covered blob in the distance

off his balaclava He is JAY - good-looking serious (30s)

As he removes his balaclava the other ALF members take
off theirs Theyre all younger than Jay in their 20s Jay
introduces each member to Mija Jacket is K (Asian) The
woman is RED The two others are men - BLOND and SILVER Each
are named after the color of their hair Silver looks sweet
but socially awkward very thin Red and Blond look restless

JAY
And my name is Jay

K TRANSLATES for Mija - word-for-word

MIJA
I’m Mija And this is Okja

K
(chuckling)
Mija Okja Those are like old-
fashioned names That’s sweet

Jay gives K a “so what” look Awkward silence

JAY
We are animal lovers We rescue
animals from slaughterhouses zoos
labs We tear down cages and set
them free This is why we rescued
Okja

Mija bows politely

MIJA
Thank you so much

Jay speaks in an overly formal manner as he fixes his
necktie

JAY
For forty years our group has
liberated animals from places of
abuse

Jay gestures to K K removes a mini-tablet from his jacket
and shows it to Mija

CLOSE on the mini-tablet OLD ARCHIVE FILM of the ALF
smashing down doors with hammers and crowbars and rescuing
the caged animals inside

JAY (CONTD)
We inflict economic damage on those
who profit from their misery We
reveal their atrocities to the
public And we never harm anyone -
human or non-human That is our
forty year credo

THUMP Jay turns at the sound of something falling and sees
Silver barely being held up by Blond He looks pale sickly

JAY (CONTD)
Are you okay Silver
(to Blond)
He didnt eat anything even today

BLOND
(shaking his head)
Hes still trying to leave the
smallest footprint he can on the
planet Earth

SILVER
(weakly)
All food production is
exploitative

BLOND
(exasperated)
What about tomatoes

SILVER
Ripened with ethylene gas
Transported in trucks

JAY
I admire your conviction Silver
but your pallid complexion worries
me

Jay turns to Mija
JAY (CONTD)
How long have you and Okja lived
together

MIJA
Since I was four

At this the group let out a low sigh

JAY
Do you know where she was being
taken

MIJA
To America The Best Super Pig
Fest

JAY

Yes But she was being taken
somewhere else first Mija You
need to prepare yourself
Everything you believe you know
about Okja is a lie

Mija instinctively reaches out to touch Okja

JAY (CONTD)
Okjas other destination was

K presses the screen on his mini-tablet We see PHOTOGRAPHS
of a WAREHOUSE It looks ABANDONED But its surrounded by
barbed wired fences and AMERICAN SECURITY GUARDS

JAY (CONTD)
This underground laboratory in
Paramus New Jersey This is the
building where Okja was created

Mija frowns - then grins

MIJA
No Okja was born on a ranch in
Arizona Her mother was born in
Chile On a beautiful farm

JAY
Okja was created in this lab So
was her so-called mother This is
where Mirando experiment with their
genetically mutated animals

Mija looks troubled

JAY (CONTD)
Theyre looking to develop the
breed that will generate them the
biggest profit In that very lab
You and the other local farmers
across the world are just
promotional devices for them - just
a picturesque backdrop

MIJA
Backdrop

SILVER
They make everything seem cosy But
its not cosy Its never cosy

JAY
Mirando know their consumers wont
eat mutant GM foods So ten years
ago their beautiful head
psychopath Lucy Mirando - who by
the way became CEO by forcing out
another psychopath named Nancy
Mirando in a fucked-up coup
détat Anyway they went into
the laboratory and dug around
amongst all the disfigured
misshapen creatures to unearth the
prettiest ones

As K quietly translates he shows Mija more photographs of
the laboratorys innocuous-looking exterior

JAY (CONTD)
And then - big fanfare - she sent
them around the world

K pulls up a file on his mini-tablet Its VIDEO of Lucys
press conference from ten years ago We see the photographs
of the SUPER PIGLETS being handed to farmers across the
world We see Lucy on the stage

REPORTER
When do we get to see the big pigs

For a tiny moment Lucy looks like she doesnt know what to
say Then she recovers

LUCY
Ten years

K pauses the video - a freeze-frame of Lucy a triumphant
glint in her eye

JAY
You know why she said ten years To
consolidate power The longer the
projects duration the longer
shed get to be at the top running
things

RED
And those were the ten years you
spent with Okja

Mija stares blankly her face crowded with conflicting
emotions

JAY
And now the ten years are nearly
up Theyve been frantically
breeding super pigs and soon the
supermarkets will be filled with
their flesh and organs Dog food
hot dogs bacon

K translates clearly for Mija

JAY (CONTD)
Our plan is to put a stop to their
project by exposing the lab and its
crimes against animals But to do
so we need video from inside -
footage of the horrible atrocities
being committed in the lab And
theres a problem

Mija is now completely immersed in the story She looks at
him intently

JAY (CONTD)

The security is impenetrable Other
groups have tried and failed to get
in

(Beat)
But there is a way Although we
will only go ahead with it if you
give us your consent

At this K stops translating and stares at Jay So do the
other ALF members

Jay nods

BLOND
(protesting)
If this kid doesnt give her
consent were going to abandon the
mission

JAY

(to K)
Please dont translate Hold on

(to everyone)
We do not harm any non-human or
human This little girl is Okjas
family and I will not harm her by
forcing a mission upon her that she
does not consent to

RED
We have to abort just because some
man from the 1970s wrote a fucking

credo

BLOND
Tradition doesnt make a movement
strong

SILVER

(coughing violently)
WE make a movement strong

Jay looks around coolly at his riled up colleagues He
doesnt have to raise his voice His quiet charisma instantly
subdues everyone The trailer once again silent

JAY
(Calmly)
If thats how you feel call
yourself something else and not the
ALF and dont come around here
anymore

The members look abashed by Jays words Jay quietly gazes
into Mijas eyes
JAY (CONTD)
In order to expose Mirando we need
video from inside the laboratory

K hesitates briefly before continuing to translate

JAY (CONTD)

And this is where your Okja comes
in The Mirando scientists are
dying to get their hands on her at
their underground lab Their star
super pig They’re desperate to put
her through a slew of tests

(Beat)
Which is why weve made this

K removes a small black electronic device from his pocket
and shows it to Mija

JAY (CONTD)
It looks exactly like the black box
on Okjas ear right But this one
has a transmitter that will
wirelessly send their video feed to
us We want to replace the device
on Okjas ear with this so Okja
can send us a live feed from inside
the laboratory

K
(in Korean - to Mija)
It will be like Okjas hidden
camera show

Mija is still confused

MIJA
You want to send Okja to America
To this laboratory

JAY
(nodding)
Im sorry That was indeed our
plan Rescue Okja replace the
black box and let Mirando retake
Okja

Mija cant believe what shes hearing

JAY (CONTD)
But don’t worry They wont hurt
Okja They wouldnt dare She needs
to be perfect for their beauty
pageant Whatever tests theyll do
on her in there will need to be
harmless

Mija nods but looks concerned

JAY (CONTD)
You have to trust us Weve been
planning this mission for a long
time We have a detailed plan on
how to rescue her from the event in
New York City We promise to bring
her back to you

We hear POLICE SIRENS growing closer in the background Jay
carefully puts a hand on Mijas shoulder

JAY (CONTD)
If our mission succeeds well be
able to shut down Mirandos Super
Pig project completely Well be
saving millions of Super Pigs like
Okja from death

Jay looks straight into Mijas eyes pleading earnestly Mija
looks straight back

JAY (CONTD)
But we wont do it without your
approval

Mija looks at Jay with a grave expression The police sirens
in the distance get louder

JAY (CONTD)
What is your decision

K translates the last question in a solemn voice

MIJA
Im going back to the mountain with
Okja

She says it just like that - bluntly and squarely In Korean
it sounds even more blunt and square K tries to hide his
surprise speechless Jay and the other members eagerly await
his translation

K takes a deep breath before saying

K
She agrees to the mission

Neither Mija nor the ALF members notice Ks lie The
members applaud vigorously Jay gives her a warm sincere
hug deeply moved Mija stands there not knowing what just
happened

JAY
Thank you

The SIRENS are closer than ever

The members put on their balaclavas kK opens the small side
door of the trailer Cold wind rushes in

He yells into his cell phone

K
Gol

He takes out a Ziplock bag from his pocket and puts his mini-
tablet and iPhone in the bag The members form a single file
before him and deposit their own cell phones into the bag

EXT RIVERSIDE EXPRESSWAY - EVENING

The sun has nearly set The black semi races through the dark
riverside road We see police cars and Mirando security cars
chasing after it with SIRENS blaring

The semi steers toward the railing so close that we plainly
see the dark river below While other ALF members hesitate
nervously Silver limps to the door and fearlessly jumps off
the truck

SILVER
Aaaaah -

INT TRAILER BLACK SEMI

Motivated by Silver Blond and Red dive off after him Jay is
the last one to put his cell phone in Ks Ziplock bag He
turns to Mija

JAY
Till we meet again

Jay swiftly dives out of the truck K winks at Mija as he
closes the Ziplock bag bulging with cell phones

EXT RIVERBANK HAN RIVER - EVENING

A BIKER riding along the bank looks up in surprise when a
black figure jumps from the expressway above and SPLASHES
into the water SPLASH SPLASH Columns of water go up and
the black figures subsequently swim out of the water one by
one JOGGERS stop and watch the bizarre spectacle

EXT RIVERSIDE EXPRESSWAY TRAILER BLACK SEMI - EVENING

Once K jumps the ALF member who was driving stops the
truck and runs out He throws his outdated folder phone into
the river and himself jumps off the expressway SPLASH

The police cars and Mirando security cars surround the black
semi POLICEMEN run out of their vehicles and look down at
the river defeated The circular ripples from the last
splash slowly disperse

POLICE 1
You swim

POLICE 2
Uh-uh Never

While the Police look for a way down to the bank the
Uniformed Mirando Employees open the door of the trailer
Headlights and red police lights flood inside the trailer to
reveal Okja and a wide-eyed Mija standing side by side Mija
tries to hide her confusion and anger but her eyes are moist
with tears

INT CONFERENCE ROOM MIRANDO COMPANY HEADQUARTERS - DAY

ON THE TV Amateur footage of ALF members with bolt
cutters and other tools ambushing the Mirando truck in the
underpass

AMERICAN NEWS ANCHOR (VO)
-hasnt been in the headlines for
a number of years but they are
back in the spotlight after todays
extraordinary events

16 people - including Lucy Mirando Frank Johnny and
Jennifer - sit around the table and watch the news They are
silent their expressions grave The scene looks exactly like
the photo of Obama Hillary and the national security team
watching the Bin Laden raid in the White House situation room
- right down to the gestures and the facial expressions

The only unruffled person among them is head assistant Frank
who sits in the middle in a leisurely presidential manner

AMERICAN NEWS ANCHOR (VO)
The group seems to have been highly
organized

ON THE TV We see KIM - the Mirando driver - being
interviewed in front of the truck spray-painted with the
ALF sign He speaks surprisingly good English

KIM

(smiling)
They were fast organized and on
point like ninjas No way a salary
man from Mirando could take them

(laughs)
Mirando is completely fucked
Completely fucked

A BEEP censors Kim every time he says fucked but he says
it with such emphasis that it is impossible not to read his
lips

The Mirando employees bat their eyes nervously worried about
Lucys reaction

ON THE TV A repeat of the news footage of ALF members
running in formation

EXECUTIVE 1
Look at that one

He points at the blurry figure of Silver lagging behind

EXECUTIVE 1 (CONTD)
Get some exercise you dick

He laughs and glances at Lucy for approval The tension is
palpable

FRANK
I wouldnt worry too much Luce
The ALF technically failed

EXECUTIVE 1
They werent even able to take the
product

EXECUTIVE 2
This is just a kerfuffle over
nothing We shouldnt make a big
deal out of it

EXECUTIVE 1
It actually means the security at
our US facilities and main office
is so airtight that they wouldnt
even think about breaking in
Thats why they went all the way to
South Korea

EXECUTIVE 2
The important thing is that the pig
is on its way to New York now

JENNIFER
(Brightly)
Right The Best Super Pig Fest will
continue as planned

Their eyes flicker nervously towards Lucy - who has thus far
said nothing Finally she stirs

LUCY
(quietly)
I know what they call me They call
me a psychopath

JENNIFER
YOURE not a psychopath THEYRE
the psychopaths right Ms
Mirando Theyre narcissists

Jennifer glances around the conference room pleased with
herself

LUCY
Do narcissists wear balaclavas

FRANK
Oh crazy radicals have been
calling us psychopaths since the
60s Youre a psychopath Your
sisters a psychopath Your daddy
was a psychopath

We barely notice but Frank has a CELLPHONE concealed in his
hand We see the name Nancy Mirando on the screen Hes
surreptitiously pointing it in Lucys direction

LUCY
Daddy WAS a psychopath Frank
Thats not an unfair slur What
did YOU do in the War Daddy I
manufactured the napalm that made
everyones skin fall off And he
calls ME an idiot loser

FRANK
In fairness to your father when he
called you an idiot loser

LUCY
Yes

FRANK
You had just signed up for a two
year course in California called
Unleash Your Calling

LUCY
At a highly respected Institute for
the Advancement of Human Potential
Where many forward-thinking CEOs

go

Lucys anxiety level is rising Shes beginning to display
subtle OCD symptoms - repeating phrases and movements

LUCY (CONTD)
And if you cant see the
correlation between the advancement
of my human potential and the fact
were currently on the cusp of the
biggest product launch in the
history of the food industry then I
dont know what You know how I
spent my time at the Institute
VISUALIZING new and better ways of
doing business While SISTER was
what was the name of the lake that
exploded

FRANK
Moose Lake

LUCY
While my sister was dumping so much
toxic waste into Moose Lake it
EXPLODED the only lake ever to
explode well done Nancy I was
visualizing how to turn the most
hated agrochemical company in
America into the most likeable
miracle pig rearing company And
its WORKING Its WORKING It was
WORKING until last night Until
last night the synthesis between
New Mirando and Old Mirando was
impeccable

Lucy holds both of her hands in the air

LUCY (CONTD)
I took science

Lucy manipulates her left hand into a deformed claw

LUCY (CONTD)
And nature

Lucy waves her right hand softly mimicking ocean waves or a
field of crops blowing gently in the wind

LUCY (CONTD)
And I synthesized

She brings both hands together mimicking a flower blooming

LUCY (CONTD)
And EVERYONE loved it Remember
what the New York Times called our
Super Pigs Intriguing Slate
Lucy Mirando is pulling off the
impossible Shes making us fall in
love with a creature that were
also excited about eating These
are journalists who never write
about pigs They never write about
pigs But they wrote about OUR
pigs Ten years of planning Were
on the cusp of launching a product
that will feed MILLIONS And what
happens We fall victim to
terrorism And somehow WERE the
ones that come out looking bad

JENNIFER
(brightly)
Oh we dont look too bad

LUCY
We dont Rewind

right about how bad they look

the blame

LUCY
Abusing that adorable girl in the

A silence before it dawns on the Executives that Lucy isnt
asking a rhetorical question

EXECUTIVE 1
Super pigs

LUCY
Holding indigenous farmers in high
esteem Who are we violently
manhandling right there on TV

EXECUTIVE 2
(beat)
The granddaughter of an indigenous
farmer
LUCY
Is that the reason why shes

Unbeknownst to Lucy Frank has his phone pressed to his ear
listening He puts it down Suddenly he pushes his chair
back with a loud SQUEAK He casually saunters over to the
coffee machine and makes himself a capsule coffee The
machine pisses out coffee with a loud obnoxious WHIR

FRANK
Lucy May I say something

Frank looks over at Lucy as he smells his coffee

FRANK (CONTD)
The girl Youre thinking of

of them leave the stage Hand in

Frank watches Lucy become more and more excited He is more
laid back than ever

LUCY (CONTD)
Shell be the face of the Mirando

the Mirando ideal Young pretty
eco-friendly global Shes a
godsend Are you writing all this

Jennifer and the Executives write notes with fury
Suddenly Johnny stands up in a HUFF

JOHNNY

JOHNNY
To examine my options

LUCY
Go on then Examine them Are you

Lucy stares at Johnny He sits down - his humiliation
complete

Lucy resumes her conversation with Jennifer like nothing
happened

LUCY (CONTD)
Get her a first-class ticket and
book her a hotel She probably
doesnt have a passport Get her a
passport Dont try to force an
image on her - like what Benetton

Reporter 2 tries to lift up her sleeve but Mija slaps his
hand away A FEMALE REPORTER whod been watching from behind
jumps in and tries to forcibly pull up Mijas sleeve Mija
resists mightily As she grapples with the Female Reporter
we see someone hurtling into the station in the background
with a worried face - Hee Bong

Hee Bong squeezes in between the Reporters and grabs Mijas
arm He raises the sleeve himself

HEE BONG
Let me see

The Reporters briefly step back at Hee Bongs apparent
aggression Hee Bong checks Mijas arms neck everywhere

Reporters with the other He is never violent but puts up a
formidable fight as he fends them off He is old but strong

The Reporters are backing away when one of them suddenly dips
down and POPS a flash up at Mijas face Hee Bong violently
SLAPS the camera away stunning the Reporter

HEE BONG (CONTD)

As soon as he apologizes he returns to roughly pushing the
reporters The grappling match becomes more and more heated

the yellow line of the narrow mountain road and hurtling
toward Mijas car Okja the piglet SQUEALS in the foreground

CUT TO

The car is crashed in the woods on the steep incline
bordering the road Okja crawls out of the broken window and
looks inside the car with a worried look We see five-year-
old Mija bleeding her eyes out of focus Okja climbs toward
the road as fast as she can

CUT TO

Grainy footage from a fixed high angle CAMERA seems to be
traffic camera footage from the road

Okja climbs onto the road and begins SQUEALING frantically
toward the cars as they whiz by dangerously close to her One
car stops and a YOUNG MAN steps out Okja continues to
SQUEAL as she leads the man down to the woods The man
discovers the wreckage and hurries down the incline after
her

The upbeat MONTAGE MUSIC changes into

IE LABORATORY ENTRANCE PARAMUS NEW JERSEY - EVENING
---DARK OPPRESSIVE MUSIC
CLOSE ON Okjas terrified face as shes dragged into the

dilapidated warehouse - the front for the laboratory The
lights are dim and the atmosphere ominous

IE NEARBY MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The ALF team is gathered around the laptop eyes anxiously
on the screen Red opens the large bag and takes out a round
satellite dish

K connects the satellite dish to the receiver With the dish
up static decreases and the image becomes clearer

JAY
Are we recording

K
Of course

We begin to see the inside of the secret laboratory through
Okjas POV The ALF members all lean in

SILVER
Oh my God

INT LABORATORY - WHITE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Okjas POV We see small cages lined on either side of the
hallway each containing tiny Super Piglets A piglet with a
hideously large tumor one with red veiny eyes and neck-
twitching tic symptoms one dragging its deformed hind
legs

Victims of genetic experimentation They SQUEAL loudly when
they see Okja Okja also lets out a heart-wrenching SQUEAL as
if commiserating with the piglets in the cages

The seasoned MIRANDO LABORATORY WORKERS move Okja toward a
steel door pulling on her leash and poking her from behind
with stun batons The Worker in the front opens the door to
reveal an immaculate white room Inside the room is none
other than Dr Johnny Wiseman He greets Okja
enthusiastically dressed in a white gown

JOHNNY
Okja

He runs his hands over Okjas body

JOHNNY (CONTD)
So we reunite In this wretched
laboratory no less

Johnny lovingly caresses Okjas face clearly drunk Behind
him we see a hideous male Super Pig twisting its gigantic
body It is about 15 times the size of Okja

JOHNNY (CONTD)
Let me introduce you to each other
Alfonso say hello to Okja Okja
Alfonso Your boyfriend Haha

Johnny drags Okja toward ALFONSO the male pig As the steel
door shuts with a loud CLANK the MONTAGE MUSIC abruptly
stops

Oppressive SILENCE fills the screen

INT MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Heavy silence The faces of the ALF members are lit by the
ghostly light of the computer screen

They are seeing Okjas POV but because one side of the
‘White Room is covered entirely by a mirror they see
everything Okja is going through

Johnny and the Lab Workers drag Okja toward Alfonso who is
increasingly excited at the sight of her Okjas fearful
SCREAM pierces the computer speakers

SILVER
Can you turn down the volume
please

K lowers the volume his face filled with dread

RED
(Sobbing)
We should never have sent her
there

BLOND
Stop it

RED
We knowingly sent her into that
chamber of horrors

BLOND
No we didnt We didnt know theyd
hurt her That you know they’d
put her through a mating

RED
We suspected Come on We all
suspected

Okjas SCREAM and Reds sobbing become blended in a sorrowful
harmony The male members sit in uncomfortable silence K
looks especially distraught Jay quietly approaches Red and
puts a hand on her shoulder

JAY
Dont cry We cant be weak

BLOND
Right This is all the more reason
to stay focused and stick to our
plan

JAY
The little girl trusted us with
Okja We have to respect her
bravery

K cannot keep it to himself any longer
K
She never agreed to send Okja

What All eyes fall on K Red stops crying

BLOND
What did you just say

K
When she was in our truck She
said she was taking Okja back to
the mountains

Jay and the members are speechless

K (CONTD)
(sighs)
I lied
RED

You little piece of shit I knew
something was up in that truck

JAY
(Quietly)
Why did you lie

K
I dont know In that moment I
just couldnt stop the mission It
was the coolest mission ever

K stares at the cool ALF tattoo on his wrist Jay gets up
from the sofa and walks over He gently lays a hand on Ks

shoulder

JAY
K its okay Look at me

As soon as K looks up - POW - Jay drives a fist across his
face Before the other members can even react Jay pushes K

into a corner and begins pummeling him mercilessly

JAY (CONTD)
I hold you dear to my heart - as I
do all creatures - but you have
dishonored the forty year history
and meaningful legacy of the Animal
Liberation Front You have betrayed
the great minds and brave fighters
who preceded you

Even as he unloads a savage beating Jay maintains his formal
manner of speech speaking like hes at an academic seminar

JAY (CONTD)
You have besmirched a forty year
tradition

Jay withdraws his fists and gathers his breath He looks down
at K

JAY (CONTD)
Never mistranslate Translations
are sacred

Jay throws a bag at K

JAY (CONTD)
From this moment on you are no
longer a member of the ALF You
are permanently banned Get out
However since its vital that we
proceed with our mission we will
have to return your equipment after
its completion Consider this your
last contribution to the ALF

K wipes the blood off his lips dejected disgraced He puts
the bag over his shoulder and begins to walk out He stops by
the table and adjusts the position of the satellite dish
When he does the image on the laptop instantly becomes
clearer

INT LABORATORY - WHITE ROOM - LATER

CLOSE ON a green soju bottle Johnny picks it up and gulps it
down Alfonso isnt in the room anymore Okja is sprawled on
the floor lifeless A dreadful silence The heavily
inebriated Johnny takes the remainder of the soju and walks
over to Okja He crouches before her

JOHNNY
You want some

He pours some on his hand and brings it to her mouth Okja
closes her nostrils repulsed by the smell Johnny doesnt
care He just slurps it up himself He licks every last drop

JOHNNY (CONTD)
It makes you feel better

Okja is completely drained from the brutal mating session
with Alfonso barely moving Johnny also lies on the floor
resting his head on his arm face to face with Okja

JOHNNY (CONTD)
The first time is the hardest
Itll get easier

Johnny lets out a melancholy sigh

JOHNNY (CONTD)

Oh this is a unspeakable place I
know I know And this room isnt
even the worst There are worse
rooms out there

(Beat)
Lucy Mirando told me I wasnt to
harm you in here At least not
visibly She wants you perfect for
her big telecast

Johnny starts to rise

JOHNNY (CONTD)
But when a woman humiliates a man
in front of his colleagues a man
is inclined to make his own
decisions

Johnny suddenly picks up a piece of long metallic equipment
from the floor

JOHNNY (CONTD)
So there is one last thing This

Johnny laughs He fits the tip of the equipment with a
needle

JOHNNY (CONTD)
This Its called a biopsy gun
What it does is
(laughs)
Its nothing really Its used on
beef I mean live cows To
check the marbling

A phone RINGS inside the room Johnny presses the
speakerphone button and we hear Jennifers annoyingly high-
pitched voice

JENNIFER (VO)
Hi Johnny Is Okja with you Will
you put her on the phone

JOHNNY
What

JENNIFER (VO)
(with a laugh)
Our precious local farmer princess
insists that she speaks to her on
the phone Whatever She says you
should lift her ear and put the
receiver underneath

JOHNNY
Youre on speakerphone

We hear a SNAP as Mija snatches the phone from Jennifer We
hear her voice through the speaker

MIJA (VO)
Okja

The previously lifeless Okja opens her eyes and leaps to her
feet upon hearing Mijas voice

OKJA
Eeeeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhh

IE MOVING VAN NEAR JFK - EVENING

MIJA
Okja - Are you okay

We see the JFK terminal growing farther in the rear window
Mija practically screams into the phone

Jennifer and the Mirando employees cover their ears

OKJA (VO)
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

MIJA
What I cant hear you

INT LABORATORY - WHITE ROOM

Johnny SLAMS off the speakerphone Okja cries saying
something to Mija When the sound abruptly stops she begins
to shift back and forth nervously Okjas desperate dance
enrages Johnny and he SMASHES the speakerphone on the floor

Okja freezes Johnny wobbles over with the biopsy gun in one
hand and a semi-translucent iPad in the other Open on the
iPad is an app developed by Mirando for intra-company use
When Johnny takes a picture of Okja using the app 3-D
contours appear over the picture along with the names of meat
parts

He aims the gun on Okjas back He pretends to stick the
needle in her skin

JOHNNY
BANG Sirloin

Okja lets out a weak GROWL

JOHNNY (CONTD)
The shank Oh yeah

Johnny laughs as he drunkenly sways from side to side He
touches the needle of the biopsy gun

JOHNNY (CONTD)

Dont worry You wont die Im
just going to take a bit of your
meat Of course Im not going to
eat it We have tasters for that

(laughs)
Theyre a bunch of half-wit
degenerate fucktards

He laughs like a madman Okja MOANS weakly

Johnny is losing his mind partially due to the alcohol but
mostly due to his guilt

JOHNNY (CONTD)
So Im gonna have to poke you
in five places

He raises the gun

JOHNNY (CONTD)
Im sorry

Johnny becomes teary-eyed His emotions swing wildly from
manic laughter to self-pitying sorrow

JOHNNY (CONTD)
Its gonna hurt
(sobs )
But I cant anesthetize you We
need to eat your meat

Okja MOANS Johnny weeps uncontrollably his face a mask of
tears and snot

JOHNNY (CONTD)
I shouldnt be here Im an animal
lover Everyone knows that about
me And the sick shit Lucy makes us
do in here

breaking It makes my stomach --

from the sting Her SCREAM echoes throughout the room

EXT STREETS MANHATTAN - DAY

A bright afternoon An enormous Super Pig balloon emerges
through the buildings Below the balloon is a banner Best
of the Best Magical Animals Super Pig Fest

The scene resembles the Macys Thanksgiving Parade The
balloon is pulled from below by dozens of men and women in
UNIFORMS They are followed by a MARCHING BAND and other
parade participants People cheer and take pictures - finally
a chance to meet the famous Super Pig

INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE MIJAS HOTEL SUITE - DAY

Jennifer and STYLIST 1 quickly walk down the boutique hotel
hallway carrying a Mirando uniform on a hanger fluid
STEADICAM following from behind

Jennifer inspects the uniform front and back

JENNIFER
What the hell is this

We see wild cursive scrawled on the bright uniform Hardly
couture Messy

STYLIST 1
Thats Lucys autograph Designed
by Lucy Mirando

JENNIFER
She cant get enough of herself
can she

Jennifer looks tired from the weeks of rigorous event
planning but as soon as she opens the hotel room door she
turns her face upside down and returns to her usual
hyperactive self

JENNIFER (CONTD)
(brightly)
Hows everyone doing

People busily mill about in Mijas suite Mija is surrounded
by a MAKEUP ARTIST HAIR STYLIST and WARDROBE STYLIST 2 and
seems to be in some sort of stand-off involving the fanny
pack

STYLIST 2
Do you have to wear this thing It
looks super tacky

Mija seems to have understood clings tightly to the fanny
pack

MIJA
Get lost I’m keeping this on

Mijas outburst startles Jennifer and the staff A white male
employee the TRANSLATOR tries to calm Mija in imperfect
Korean

TRANSLATOR
Okay all right Its okay its
okay You can keep it

Jennifer and the staff regard her nervously The Translator
cautiously glances at Mija before saying

TRANSLATOR (CONTD)
(to the staff quietly)
I think she understands some
English We should watch what we
say

The Translator surreptitiously points at the Smile
Beginners Conversation English book on the table Jennifer
and the staff glance at the book then Mija

JENNIFER
(brightly)

Yes yes everything is fine But
you have to wear this Isnt this
uniform pretty Its a special
edition custom-made just for you
Look The CEO even autographed it
Totally rad right Wow

Jennifer continues to hype it up but Mija is not in the
mood She refuses bluntly

MIJA
No I want to see Okja first

JENNIFER
Mija Sweetheart Youll meet her
on stage in just a few hours
Wearing this very pretty uniform
Think about how dramatic it’1l be

As Jennifers speech becomes more and more impassioned a
ROOM SERVICE worker enters with a cart and begins putting
down food Confused chatter Who ordered food Looks

fantastic Just sign for it Garbled voices overwhelm the
suite

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Okja doesnt even know youre here
If you show up on stage without
telling her it’ll be such a great
surprise Im getting emotional
just thinking about it Yay

MIJA
(cold)
I dont care I need to see Okja
Right now Or I wont cooperate
with the event

Mija is unrelenting A fatigue comes over Jennifer as she
listens to the Translator She turns cold

JENNIFER
Mija I dont think you understand
this situation We are the ones who
have Okja Okay We are doing you a
favor Do you get it now

Mija becomes nervous Weve never seen Jennifer like this
before

JENNIFER (CONTD)
(smiles)
You want to go back home with Okja
right Then do as youre told
Otherwise this is what will happen
to Okja

Jennifer removes the lid of the room service tray next to
her revealing a deliciously cooked pork chop steak Mija is
petrified Jennifer holds out the uniform again

JENNIFER (CONTD)
Put it on

Mija fearfully takes the uniform and goes into the suite
bedroom

INT BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

As soon as she closes the sliding door the voices recede
into the background and a vast loneliness overcomes her
Dust particles glow in the beam of light falling through the
curtains

She SIGHS as she looks at the strangely designed uniform She
glimpses something behind it - a SHADOW lurking in the
corner Mija GASPS The Shadow soon reveals himself to be the
Room Service Worker from earlier and the Room Service
Worker is subsequently revealed to be JAY

JAY
Shhh

Mija stares at Jay stunned Jay quietly removes a stack of
papers from behind his back Short EnglishKorean
wordsphrases are written on cards the size of a small
sketchbook Jay begins to flip through the cards in front of
Mija kind of like Bob Dylan in his Subterranean Homesick
Blues video

JAY (CONTD)

SORRY
MIJA
(mouthing)
What
JAY

FOR EVERYTHING

Mija silently nods still nervous

JAY (CONTD)
‘WE WILL RESCUE OKJA FROM THE
STAGE

We begin to hear MARCHING BAND MUSIC in the far distance Jay
flips the cards almost to the beat

JAY (CONTD)
‘WHEN WE DO DONT ‘LOOK BACK

Mija puzzled

JAY (CONTD)
‘DONT EVER LOOK AT THE SCREEN
‘BEHIND YOU

Jay changes his expression slightly with each card

JAY (CONTD)
‘ONLY LOOK AT OKJA IN FRONT
OF YOU

Mija still hasnt the faintest idea what hes talking about
but Jays dead seriousness somehow compels her to nod

Jay nods back with a serene smile He flips the last card
over

JAY (CONTD)
ALF LOVES YOU

Jay vanishes through the curtains We hear him going down the
metal steps of the fire escape Mija is left alone again in
the dark bedroom

EXT STREETS MANHATTAN - DAY

Jay casually saunters out of the hotel alley and walks out
onto the large street He changes into his suit as he walks
and joins the Super Pig Festival parade happening in the
street

Among the dozens of people holding the lines of the giant
Okja balloon is SILVER disguised as one of the Uniformed
Employees He exchanges secret glances with Jay who walks
along the sidewalk Silver gives Jay a knowing look as he
points up at the balloon and Jay looks up as well

Mirando EVENT WORKERS distribute samples - Super Pig jerkies
and Super Sausages - practically showering the crowd with
them People eat them up enthusiastically

Some of the Employees holding the chords of the balloon also
dig into the samples giddy at seeing the brand new products
Silver becomes nauseated by the mere sight

A Mirando Employee marching next to him hands him a Super
Sausage sample Finding himself with the most vile junk food
made from GM Super Pigs in his hand Silver turns white like
a sheet Conscious of all the Mirando eyes around he
pretends to eagerly munch on the sausage but he cannot get
past the stench of meat and nearly retches

A SKINNY MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN sees this and looks down at a
sample fallen on the ground As she crouches to pick it up
we glimpse an ALF tattoo below her slightly raised shirt

A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT sees the tattoo as hes walking by and
quickly checks the surroundings He seems worried that
someone might see the tattoo As he turns he bumps into a
twenty-something WOMAN walking past A black balaclava drops
from his jacket The High School Student turns pale upon
seeing the dropped balaclava

HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT
Im so sorry

The Woman just smiles and picks up the balaclava for him As
she reaches out to give it back she tugs on one side of her
jacket pulling it over her t-shirt The A L from the word

ALIVE on the t-shirt connects with the F of the word LIFE

of the jacket to spell out ALF

The Student sees this and flashes a faint smile He puts the
balaclava back in his jacket and walks toward the parade

More and more people join the parade under the giant Okja
balloon

INT DRESSING ROOM LUXURY TRAILER - DAY

smiles at Frank through the mirror

shared - their crowning achievement realized

Lucy smells the flowers

LUCY

fast

LUCY (CONTD)

FRANK
She just wants to support you on
your big day Its what we all

LUCY

Lucy quietly regards Franks eyes She is now beyond panic
actually rather calm The MARCHING BAND MUSIC which had
remained in the background so far becomes loud as it arrives
in front of the trailer The trailer thumps with the sound of
DRUMS

The marching band reaches a climax as the enormous inflatable
super pig floats above the stage

The crowd GOES WILD as Johnny jumps up excitedly on the
stage He swings his arms wildly acting like hes conducting
the orchestra

The marching band stops playing at the exact moment A brief
moment of silence before the crowd erupts in APPLAUSE
Johnny snatches up the microphone and yells into it like a
rock star

Concentrating hard he connects an HDMI cable to his laptop
and does an equipment check

LUCY
Don’t worry Im not here to bore
you with some corporate speech Im

The audience laughs

JOHNNY
I wonder what she bought Maybe
some oinkment Or maybe a DVD
Jurassic Pork Or a copy of Porks
Illustrated If she did I hope she
doesnt HOG it I want a look at

The audience and Lucy groan Lucy puts up her hand to shush
everyone

LUCY
So let’s all welcome an
extraordinary young girl

Acoustic indie music plays through the loudspeakers

LUCY (CONTD)
A local farmer who raised her Super
Pig in wild and beautiful nature
with more love than I could have
ever asked for

With a loud WHIR the barrel-like lift containing Mija begins
to rise Mijas nervous face peeks over the stage

LUCY (0S) (CONTD)
The fearless pig rider from all the
way across the globe Please
welcome Miiii - Jaaaaaaa -

Mija turns bright red upon seeing the cheering crowd She
waves at them with an awkward smile But she keeps her focus

Mijas eyes suddenly widen She sees Okja approaching the
stage on a parade float

LUCY (CONTD)
And here she is Our ultimate Super
Pig Okjaaaa

The crowd cheer as they turn around Okja stands atop a
parade float decorated with trees and flowers She feeds on
the real grass covering the top of the float as it approaches
slowly

Mija cups her hands around her mouth and yells

MIJA
Okja

Mija waves her arms wildly but Okja doesnt look up She
merely continues to chomp on the grass

LUCY
Separated by a cruel twist of fate
Okja and Mija Best friends
forever reunited by the Mirando
Company

The Mirando Event Staff begin to penetrate the crowd in a
single file

Once theyve threaded through they divide the crowd to make
a path It is almost like the parting of the Red Sea The
parade float enters the path and proceeds toward Mija

Jay stands among the crowd He looks up at Mija and scans the
surroundings on high alert

MIJA

Okja its me
(sobs )

I came for you

Jennifer stands below the stage eagerly awaiting the dramatic
reunion

JENNIFER

Okja is now only a few feet away from Mija but she still
doesnt look up She continues to mindlessly chew on the
grass The crowd begins to stir and Lucy becomes nervous

Finally Mija jumps at Okja and grabs her face

MIJA
Okja Whats wrong

Okja shakes her head from side to side like she has a tic
Mija lifts up Okjas drooped eyelid

MIJA (CONTD)
AAAHH

The crowd hold their breath Silence spreads throughout the
plaza

CLOSE ON Okjas eyes They resemble shark eyes No focus no
soul Both eyes are completely saturated blood-red

MIJA (CONTD)
What did you do to my Okja

BUZZ Piercing static noise as the LED multi-screen loses its
picture The clips of local farmers in vast unadulterated
nature disappear from the screen Jay picks up his cell phone
as he stands amidst the confused crowd

appears on the screen We see horrendously deformed GMO
piglets screaming in pain fear Okja suddenly SQUEALS and
spasms uncontrollably

LUCY
What the hell is going on

Mija tries to calm Okja
Mija can sense that something horrific is being shown on the
screen behind her but she never turns around - just as she

was told by Jay

The crowd scream and shout in horror and anger at what
they’re seeing on the screen

The highlight is when the drunk and pathetic Dr Johnny tells
Okja

JOHNNY
the sick shit Lucy makes us do
in here Christ knows how many laws
were breaking It makes my stomach

BANG Johnny pulls the biopsy gun trigger mid-speech

Blond has LOOPED that dreadful moment so it plays on the
giant LED screen OVER AND OVER

Johnny and Lucy stare at the screen at a loss Audience
members SHOUT IN FURY throwing bottles and cans in their
direction

LUCY
Turn it off

Johnnys brain whirs What can he possibly do to rescue his
reputation He approaches the microphone

JOHNNY
(with as much sincerity as
he can muster)
I promise - no I pledge - to learn
from this

Johnnys face is a picture of humility He gulps A beat
Then a soda can hits him straight between the eyes

INT ABANDONED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Red casually smokes a cigarette as watches the plaza below
descend into further pandemonium She takes the cigarette and
carefully brings it to the fuse on top of the DIY bazooka
She watches the CRACKLING fuse slowly disappear

EXT LED MULTI-SCREEN STAGE - CONTINUOUS

A loud BOOM A mortar is fired from the nearby abandoned
building The handmade bomb flies across the air leaving a
wake of white baking powder It hits the Super Pig balloon
smack in the middle People scream as the balloon POPS

When it does fliers and print-outs that were hidden inside
the balloon pour out onto the street

As soon as the mortar fires Jay puts on his balaclava The
other ALF members dispersed throughout the crowd do the
same Soon the plaza is covered by a sea of black heads

They vastly outnumber the NYPD OFFICERS and Mirando Event
Staff Lucy begins to panic

The punctured balloon begins to shoot around wildly and
Silver pulls on the chord with all his strength to steer it
toward the crowd Because of his gaunt frame he is steered
by the balloon instead lifted up and sideways like a
marionette on strings Still he somehow manages to keep the
balloon on course and the fliers fall over the crowd like
snow on an open field

run over to pick up the printouts As they do we hear

circuitry

history They have completely taken over the plaza Jay jumps
on the stage necktie heroically flapping in the air He
lifts his balaclava slightly and shows Mija his face

Mija is too busy trying to calm Okja who SQUEALS and
thrashes at the increasing confusion around her Mija tries
her best to connect but the red-eyed Okja is still
unresponsive

Mija sprints toward the wild and unruly Okja She leaps onto
Okjas face and tries to hug her but Okja bites on her arm

Mija lets out a horrible SCREAM Jay and the ALF members

dont know what to do as they watch the red-eyed Okja clamp

down on Mijas blood-dripping arm Jay picks up a microphone
stand He is about to stab Okja in the mouth when

MIJA
No

Mija stops Jay with her other arm She looks up at Okja
biting down the bone-crushing pain Okjas eyes are still
red lost She growls as she shakes her head from side to
side nearly tearing off Mijas arm In spite of the horrible
pain Mija puts on a peaceful face She smiles and begins
caressing Okjas face with her free hand

MIJA (CONTD)
Okja

Okja lets out a weak growl

MIJA (CONTD)
Its okay

Okjas violent motions slowly subside The crowd watches
closely

MIJA (CONTD)
Trees The trees

MIJAS POV AS SHE LIES ON THE STAGE

We see Manhattan skyscrapers piercing the sky No trees The
blue sky behind Okjas face however is the same blue sky we
saw back in the mountains

MIJA (CONTD)
Clouds The blue sky

Mija whispers as she caresses Okjas face She has completely
forgotten about the pain her face more peaceful than ever
Okjas breathing becomes more even

The violent activity in the plaza becomes a meaningless blur
to Mija and Okja as they gaze at each other The police
fighting the ALF the angry crowd screaming at Johnny and
Lucy - we barely notice it now The red subsides from Okja’s
eyes Her face returns to the gentle innocent Okja we know
She belatedly comes to and frets over what she has done She
licks the blood off Mijas arm

JAYS POV Behind the crowd we see a black semi-trailer
truck rushing toward the plaza At Jays signal the ALF
crew begin moving in organized fashion They fight off police
and crowd members and create a path for the semi to approach
Mija and Okja

JAY
Our driver has arrived

At that moment a large steel-enforced vehicle appears at the
intersection and CRASHES into the ALF semi forcing it off
the road and into a nearby street lamp The steel surface is
unpainted making it look all the more intimidating
MERCENARIES in special ops uniforms rush out from the back

The uniforms are marked with the name BLACK CHALK - Private
Security Company Other Black Chalk cars arrive from all
directions Soon they surround the entire plaza

The specially-trained mercenaries attack and subdue the
ALF members with an UNEXPECTED technique Every method
they utilize is designed to look to the Manhattan passers-by
like no big deal - just an apparently gentle arm-lock or
little dig at a pressure point or underneath a finger nail
But close-up it’s clear they’re inflicting INCREDIBLE PAIN on
the ALF These are brilliant martial-arts techniques - it
is violence so discreet the onlookers are oblivious to it
The SCREAMS of the ALF members seem incongruous and
pathetic as a result

A MAN IN A SHARP SUIT emerges from the steel-enforced vehicle
and walks over to the NYPD COMMANDING OFFICER He hands the
officer a stack of documents

SHARP SUIT
We are Black Chalk - a Private
Security Company Weve just signed
a contract with Nancy Mirando of
the Mirando Company

NYPD COMMANDING OFFICER
Okay

SHARP SUIT
Here is info about our team of
attorneys We are restraining the
demonstrators because they’re
hindering our client’s business and
destroying her property As you can
see we are not using excessive
force

ALF members scream in front of Jay as they’re being
subdued by the mercenaries Jays heart breaks at the sight
but he forces himself to turn away He climbs off the stage
and runs away as fast as he can with Mija and Okja in tow A
few ALF members follow to protect them including Red and
Blond and Silver Black Chalk Mercenaries quickly give chase

EXT BELOW THE STAGE - DAY

Lucy - in HIDING - watches the chaos unfold Her shock has
subsided and shes rather calm She takes out a cigarette and
looks for a lighter but cant find one

Nancy Mirando enters the FRAME with a lighter and lights
Lucys cigarette We still only see Nancy from behind

LUCY
You knew this would happen of
course Nancy

NANCY
Not at all

LUCY
Well Good luck with cleaning up my
mess

Lucy is acting calm but shes bereft Nancy squeezes Lucys
shoulder

LUCY (CONTD)
For a while back then I forgot I
was a fucking loser Nance

NANCY
Oh Luce Dad should never have
done and said those things to you
But why rebel against his legacy so
ridiculously

We see Nancys face for the first time She looks exactly
like Lucy Identical twins

NANCY (CONTD)
I mean Dad was a terrible man But
he was fucking good at business

Nancy takes out a cigarette and tries to light it but the
lighter wont work She lights it from the burning part of
Lucys cigarette The two sisters look like a symmetrical
decalcomania print as they stand face to face with their
cigarettes touching

We see Frank approaching in the background

NANCY (CONTD)
Dont worry about your apology
speech Ill pretend to be you in
front of the press

Nancy smiles at Lucy - an in-joke between identical twins
LUCY
(scoffs)
Fuck off
NANCY
But you’1ll need to do your own jail

time

Lucy laughs Then she stops laughing Nancy isn’t kidding

LUCY
Jail Because of that lab
footage Who cares It’s just
some

NANCY
just some animal cruelty I
know If you can even call them
animals

Nancy shivers

NANCY (CONT’D)
But our attorneys will be way too
busy to help you out of this one

We see a team of NYPD officers approach Lucy
Nancy doesnt look behind her She knows Frank is there

NANCY (CONT’D)
Frank I want to get started on
this ASAP Do you have a pen and a
pad

FRANK
Of course

Frank takes out his note pad

NANCY
The demonstrators We’1ll put them
all in jail Put together a team
for a criminal lawsuit

FRANK
Sure

Frank and Nancy move to one side to allow the NYPD officers
to surround Lucy She DISAPPEARS amongst them

NANCY
Well drastically cut down the
promotional budget Well use the
money we save on marketing to lobby
Congress and pay off the Federal
commissions

INT ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Nancys terse chilling orders continue in VOICE-OVER as we
see Okja Mija Jay and the ALF members running through
the alley We only hear Nancy and Franks voices

FRANK (VO)
What about spending some of the
money on media damage control

NANCY (VO)
No point Theyll hate us for a bit
and then theyll forget Well get
production started right away We
already have FDA approval correct

FRANK (VO)
Yes But Im not sure how the
customers will react after today

NANCY (VO)
If its cheap theyll eat it I
guarantee early sales will be high

The Black Chalk Mercenaries catch up with the ALF members
guarding Okja and Mija The mercenaries scan the area and -
seeing the coast is clear of onlookers - viciously bludgeon
them

Blond falls to the ground

We see a mercenary standing over Red She looks up at him
with disdain

MERCENARY
Slut

The Mercenary kicks her in the stomach

We see Silver pushed violently against a wall With his
slight frame Silver is easy to take down but the Mercenary
acts with extreme force anyway

As Silver lies on the ground about to lose consciousness he
spots a WOMAN and her LITTLE DOG - bystanders who have
somehow found themselves caught up in this terrifying
situation

Silvers POV The woman looks petrified But the adorable
little dog has its tongue out almost like its smiling at
Silver The little dogs smiling face is Silvers last sight
before he loses consciousness

Mija clutches her bloody arm as she runs away She looks to
the side and sees even more Black Chalk Mercenaries approach
from a different route One aims a large NET GUN at Okja

NANCY (VO)
Tell the factories to start
production tonight and begin
supplying to supermarkets hotels
and butcher shops ASAP

BOOM The fired net immediately clings to Okja She trips on
the net and tumbles

She becomes further entangled as she rolls on the ground
Mija runs over to Okja Jay turns toward her as well

Mija and Jay try to untangle Okja The Mercenaries come over
and begin to beat Jay The charismatic Jay goes down
instantly - without putting up any fight He is taken apart

NANCY (VO)
Shut down the laboratory Put all
the animals we have into
production Well go to the
production facility tonight for an
inspection Put all the execs on
call Even the ones on vacation

Okja SCREAMS through the net as shes dragged into the Black
Chalk vehicle

Mija rolls helplessly on the ground barely conscious The
Mercenaries put Jay on his knees and pull his arms back

A LOUD HONK The ALF TRUCK careers into the alley We
cant tell whos driving

While the Mercenaries are distracted by the oncoming truck
Jay runs over to Mija and rolls her out of the way just in
time The ALF truck charges on scattering the Mercenaries
out of its way

Jay helps the bloody Mija to her feet and takes her to the
next block where the ALF truck meets them after rounding
the corner They use the last of their strength to climb into
it

INT CAB BLACK SEMI - DAYEVENINGNIGHT
Jay lays the barely conscious Mija in the passenger seat
Hes exhausted and covered in blood The driver takes off his

balaclava Its K

K
Are you okay

JAY
K What are you

Jay sinks in his seat K shows him a new tattoo on his arm
‘Translations Are Sacred Jay doesnt have the energy to
respond to the ridiculous tattoo

JAY (CONTD)
Okja We need to hurry

The brutal beating has taken a toll Jays focus goes in and
out Hes lost a lot of blood

JAY (CONTD)
Okja

Mija is also barely conscious Shes losing blood fast from
the wound on her arm

FADE TO BLACK

We hear music Rhythmic like a heartbeat We see MIJAS
blurry POV as she fades in and out of consciousness

FADE IN

A blood-red sunset outside the window The semi screeches to
a stop and an IRANIAN MAN hops on carrying a medical bag He
bickers with K making big arm gestures as he removes
syringes from his bag

FADE TO BLACK
FADE IN

The sky is dark Street lamps pass by Mija turns her head
The Iranian man stitches Jays forehead with great
concentration He looks nervous The procedure is illuminated
by a flashlight between his lips An IV bottle feeding into
Mijas arm dangles precariously in the moving truck

FADE TO BLACK
FADE IN
Still night still inside the moving semi The Iranian man is
gone Mijas wound is bandaged K is driving talking on the
phone his back to us Jay has regained consciousness Hes

sitting up yelling at K but we cant hear what hes saying

A huge truck blasts by in the opposite lane with a deafening
noise

At that moment all sounds come rushing back to Mija - the
roaring wind the growling engine Jay and Ks shouting

JAY (CONTD)
Are you sure

K
Yeah It has to be true

Jay looks conflicted He sees that Mija is awake and turns to
her

JAY
Are you okay

MIJA
Yes

K turns his head slightly He translates in a rigid formal
tone sitting upright and tightly gripping the steering
wheel

MIJA (CONTD)
Where are we going

Jay and K look at each other They hesitate

JAY
Were going to Okja

MIJA
Really

JAY
(nods )
Yes but You should know that
the situation its not good
Im sorry

Mija becomes scared She doesnt even want to ask Jay thinks
before asking

JAY (CONTD)
Whats the Black Chalk response
time after we infiltrate

K
Six seven minutes at best

K floors the pedal accelerating further The MUSIC becomes
faster like a heartbeat fueled by adrenaline The truck
begins to shake as it enters a dirt road

JAY
Is it even possible to do it in
seven minutes

MIJA
Do what

The truck pulls an abrupt turn Even amidst the shaking and
the clouds of dirt from the road Jay maintains his calm gaze

JAY
Sorry We are going to need your
help
MIJA
(Annoyed by Jays oblique
comments )

My help with WHAT

K abruptly stops the truck Jay and Mija and K climbtumble
out into

--a vast feedyard

JAY
Helping us find Okja

Mija gasps at the sight before her The field and the nearby
hill are densely packed with thousands no tens of thousands
of Super Pigs Standing atop the hill is a factory-type
slaughterhouse

EXT FEEDYARD - NIGHT

MIJA
Okja

Mija Jay and K split up and run in DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS
through the field shouting Okjas name - small dots in the
vast field filled with countless Super Pigs all with the
same face Soon they are far away from each other

K
(Calling)
Okja

Suddenly K comes face to face with an OLD SECURITY GUARD The
man rushes K and K knocks him to the ground as politely as
he can

K sees the fallen Security Guard calling for help on his
phone He looks at his watch

K (CONTD)
Shit

K quickly telephones Jay - who is somewhere far across the
field

K (CONTD)
Seven minutes Starting now
JAY
Damn
(Calling)
Okja

Mija shouts Okja’s name as she runs even louder than Jay
She suddenly stops when she hears a LOW GROWL Is it Okja A
hallucination She turns toward the sound to find

-a long line of pigs marching into the entrance of the
slaughterhouse silhouetted by the bright light from inside
A solemn death march

MIJA
(mumbling to herself)
Okja

The pig at the top of the line turns toward Mija crying
desperately

MIJA (CONTD)
Its Okja

Mija quickly looks for Jay and K but theyre too far away
Theres no time She has to do this alone

Mija runs as fast as she can toward the slaughterhouse Okja
sees her and cries harder but she is shoved further down the
line into the slaughterhouse

K sees Okja and calls after Jay who turns and begins running
toward Okja with K

A WORKER at the entrance gives Okjas bottom a jolt with a
taser Quick and efficient an everyday routine Okja starts
walking again She enters the slaughterhouse

MIJA (CONTD)
No Dont go inside

Mijas voice is overwhelmed by the machinery noise coming
from the slaughterhouse She sees an employees entrance 40
metres from the door Okja walked into She hurries towards
it

INT SLAUGHTERHOUSE - NIGHT

Mija enters the ‘factory of death The structure is
labyrinthine and she has no idea where to go Shes consumed
by shock and fear The humidity the revolting smell the
deafening noise the slick blood-covered floor A traumatic
sight for a girl who grew up in the mountains

Various slabs of meat hanging from metal hooks move steadily
along the aerial conveyor system Instinctively she runs in
the opposite direction of the movement

WORKERS wearing large noise-blocking earmuffs stand along the
conveyor system and go about their jobs They look at Mija

with some curiosity but return to their work Theyre unable
to leave the ever-moving production line

Mija finally arrives at the stun box - aka the execution box
She sees a Super Pig being forced into the box Its head is
firmly fitted into a hole in the front A YOUNG HISPANIC
WORKER aims a large bolt gun at its forehead and prepares to
shoot when he sees Mija running toward him He briefly
hesitates but soon returns his attention to his task

CLOSE on Mija’s face We hear a BANG The worker has
evidently pulled the trigger Mija is too horrified to even
scream

Mija freezes after witnessing the execution in all its
gruesome reality The next Super Pig is led into the stun
box Its Okja

MIJA
(a trembling voice)
Okja

Mija goes blank completely petrified She looks straight at
Okja whose head is being threaded through the ‘hole of
death

MIJA (CONTD)
Its okay

Okja seems to know that death is imminent She desperately
tries to free her head She looks up at Mija with tear-filled
eyes

MIJA (CONTD)
Because

Mijas voice trembles The Hispanic Worker looks at Mija as
he reloads the bolt gun He doesnt know who the hell this
girl is or why shes here He just carries on with his work

MIJA (CONTD)
Even this man

With his eyes still on Mija the Hispanic Worker aims the
bolt gun at Okjas forehead Okja closes her eyes when she
feels the cold barrel of the bolt gun on her forehead Tears
fall

Mija looks into the Workers eyes

MIJA (CONTD)
-he doesnt want to do this

Mija raises her hand at the worker Hold on She reaches
into her back pocket with her other hand For some reason
the Hispanic Worker is compelled to hold back from pulling
the trigger He looks into Mijas eyes

Mija removes a PHOTOGRAPH from her back pocket She shows it
to the Worker Its one of the photos from Mijas room 10-
year-old Mija tightly hugging Okja The Hispanic Worker
squints at the photo his bolt gun still trained on Okjas
forehead

The production line becomes backed up and the ALARM begins
to sound Red lights flash throughout the slaughterhouse

CLOSE ON the Hispanic Workers ambiguous expression

He points at the photo Mija is holding - ‘that pig - and
then points at Okja - is this pig

Mija nods quietly The Hispanic Worker freezes The finger
around the trigger trembles lightly

Just then Jay and K arrive out of breath They stop next to
Mija Okja stays absolutely still with her mouth fiercely
clamped and eyes closed Suddenly

A loud metallic CREAK

The large stun box leans to the side We see the Hispanic
Worker holding down the button

Okja still alive slides onto the conveyor belt below

Mijas legs give in and she falls on her knees She embraces
Okjas head Her arms continue to shake

The Hispanic Worker looks down at them with a heavy heart
But he soon breaks out of his lull and returns to work like
nothing happened He brings in the next pig The ALARM and
the red lights stop - the production line being back to
normal

Mija sobs as she watches the continued death march K hurries
over and helps Mija onto her feet Jay leads the group toward
the exit As they round the corner

NANCY
Was this what caused the alarm

FRANK
I believe so

they come face to face with Nancy and a dozen MIRANDO
EXECUTIVES performing an inspection of the facility We see
Black Chalk Mercenaries arriving at the entrance and running
toward Okja

NANCY
I’m staggered that security is so
lax some hooligans were able to
stop our entire production line
even for a second

FRANK
It wont happen again Please note
that Black Chalk was here exactly
on time Seven minutes after
Security telephoned them

While all the Executives look down at their watches Black
Chalk Mercenaries quickly surround Mija and the gang One of
the Mercenaries discovers Ks ALF tattoo as he restrains
him with a PlastiCuff He treats Jay and K even more
violently upon realizing who they are

Mija glares at Nancy

NANCY
Isnt this Lucy’s beloved Fearless
Pig Rider

FRANK
She is And that would be our Best
Super Pig

NANCY
Whats it doing out here It
should be on a meat hook

Tension fills the room Mija carefully breaches the silence
She speaks in English

MIJA
I wanna go home with Okja

Mija says each word slowly and clearly

NANCY
No Its my property

Mija is not sure what Nancy is saying but continues to stare
straight into her eyes

MIJA
Why you want to kill Okja

NANCY
We can only sell the dead ones

Jay barks at Nancy with his hands cuffed

JAY
You should be ashamed of yourself

NANCY
Quite the opposite Were pretty
proud of our accomplishments

K
Psychopath

NANCY
No We’re hardworking business
people And weve got it down to an
art Well a science

Nancy points at specific parts of a Super Pig carcass
dangling on a hook behind her

NANCY (CONTD)
Theres the tenderloin For the
sophisticated restaurants Mexicans
love the feet I know Go figure
We ALL love the face and the anus
They’re American as apple pie Hot
Dogs Its all edible Everything
but the squeal Will I go on No I
won’t go on

Frank gestures to the Black Chalk Mercenaries They grab Jay
and K by their arms and begin to pull them out

Jay turns to Nancy as hes being dragged out

JAY
Youre Nancy Mirando arent you

Nancy glances at Jay curious She raises her hand at the
Black Chalks to hold

NANCY
And you are

JAY
Let Mija and Okja go
NANCY
Why
K
You already have shitloads of
money
NANCY

(genuinely baffled)
But this is BUSINESS

JAY
(quietly)
I hold all creatures dear to my
heart Nancy but You’re crying
out to be an exception

Nancy scoffs The Black Chalk Mercenaries violently drag Jay
and K out of the slaughterhouse Frank gives a signal to the
Manager who in turn signals his employees The Workers run

over and drag Okja toward the stun box

MIJA
Wait

Mijas voice booms throughout the slaughterhouse She zips
open her ridiculous fanny pack and reaches inside She takes
out the shiny gold pig that Hee Bong gave her

Mija holds up the gold pig

MIJA (CONTD)
I wanna buy Okja Alive

Nancy looks at the gold pig amused The little girl is
impressive Mija pushes the gold pig toward Nancy It glides
across the slick blood-covered floor and stops at Nancys
foot Frank takes out his handkerchief and wipes the blood
off as he picks it up

Nancy picks up the gold pig and studies it carefully She
gives it a quick bite with her front teeth A strange
grotesque expression appears on her face She winces at the
lingering smell of blood before quietly gazing at Mija

NANCY
(to Frank)
We have a customer

Frank looks back and forth between Nancy and Mija his facial
expression peculiar

NANCY (CONTD)
This is worth a lot of money Make
sure the girl gets home safely The
first ever buyer of a Mirando Super
Pig
(happily to Mija)
Congratulations on your purchase

Frank calls one of the Black Chalks and delivers a few
instructions Nancy turns around and continues her inspection
with the Executives Mija finally unclenches her fist which
shed been nervously squeezing the entire time Once the
tension lifts her chest swells with a mixture of emotions

EXT FEED-YARD - NIGHT

Two Black Chalk Mercenaries lead Mija and Okja across the
expansive feed-yard Mija looks back and sees the line of
pigs marching into the slaughterhouse The death march looks
even sadder under the beautiful light of the moon Mijas
heart is heavy as she leaves the rest of the pigs behind

The pigs inside the fence watch Okja enviously as she leaves
Two Super Pigs walk along the fence and begin following Okja
Mija and Okja look at them curiously soon noticing something
between the two adult pigs - a small PIGLET their baby

The mother pig pushes the baby through the fence with her
snout The piglet is small enough to fit through the wire
but it kicks and squirms and refuses to separate from its
parents The mother stubbornly shoves it through the fence

Mija realizes what the mother is trying to do She quickly
herds the piglet under Okja’s belly and looks at the two
Black Chalk Mercenaries walking ahead They are too immersed
in their conversation to notice

The baby pig keeps looking back as it treads along under the
cover of Okja’s belly Its mother and father poke their heads
over the fence and let out a heartfelt SQUEAL - a goodbye

As they do other super pigs notice the BABY ESCAPEE and
begin SQUEALING as well Their cries spread until ALL the
super pigs in the feedyard have joined in - a CACOPHONY of
SORROW but also of DEFIANCE and CELEBRATION

The Black Chalks look around dumbfounded As they do the
cries reach a crescendo and one of the pigs begins POOPING

And then THOUSANDS do Thousands of super pigs shoot poop out
of their behinds like fireworks - a bizarre and miraculous
act of rebellion A celebration of life

Mija continues walking a brave smile her eyes moist

Okja carefully traipses along minding the piglet underneath
like her own

IE MIRANDO TRUCK - NIGHT

Inside the moving truck Mija sits inside the cargo area We
follow her gaze to find Okja sleeping in front of her
exhausted from her ordeal Okja opens her mouth to yawn and
we see the tiny piglet peeking out from underneath Okjas
huge slab of a tongue When Mija reaches out her hand the
piglet crawls out and jumps into her arms Okja doesnt even
notice that the baby is gone She continues to sleep gently
rocked by the moving truck The truck travels along the dark
road

EXT WOODS - DAY

CLOSE ON Mijas face as she sleeps Fragments of light fall
through the leaves and flicker on her face Mija opens her
eyes at the sound of BIRDS CHIRPING She looks down at her
belly where the piglet has fallen asleep with her face down
Mija gently runs her hand over the piglets body Mija in
turn is lying on top of the sleeping Okja A tower of
bodies Okja - Mija - the piglet

A gentle breeze blows from the woods The piglet shifts in
her sleep and falls off Mija onto the grass She looks
around dazed before finding a place underneath Okjas ear
and returning to sleep

The woods the sun the breeze Peace is all around

With her eyes closed Okja flaps her ears and creates a
gentle breeze for the piglet Lying on Okjas back Mija
looks up at the trees and the blue sky

EXT MIJAS HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

Hee Bong sets up an early dinner on the table outside He

walks back and forth between the kitchen and the front yard
carrying vegetables and boiled eggs and other side dishes to
the table Chickens leisurely roam the yard Hee Bong smells
the boiled potato in his hands as he brings it to the table

Okja and Mija enter the frame and pass the yard toward the
shed Okja suddenly stops and looks into the camera She
stares for a while before she is dragged into the shed by
Mija

The piglet comes in late She runs around the yard kicking up
dust and scaring the chickens Hee Bong walks out into the
dusty yard with two bowls of rice and utensils

HEE BONG
Mija

MIJA (0S)
Im here

Hee Bong sits at the table He shouts toward the shed

HEE BONG
Hurry up The foods getting cold

MIJA (0S)
Coming

Hee Bong waits He picks up the green soju bottle next to the
table and peers into it A tiny bit is left on the bottom

Hee Bong cant hold his hunger any longer As he picks up the
spoon and digs into the rice

THE END

END CREDITS begin with lively MUSIC As the CREDITS of the
KEY CREW appear one by one we CUT TO the exterior of a
prison all the way across the globe somewhere on the East
Coast of the US

EXT PRISON GATE - DAY

Bright sunlight greets Jay as he exits the penitentiary We
can tell from his hair and beard that he was inside for at
least a year or two K welcomes Jay offers him a cigarette

K
(grinning)
You’re sure you don’t want to get
some rest first I mean you only
just got out

Jay smiles without answering As a bus SWOOSHES into frame
and blocks our view we

CUT TO

INT BUS - DAY

The bus speeds through city streets Jays face fills the
foreground He looks back at the seats behind him to see

Red Blond Silver scattered around the bus They each greet
him with a knowing glance or a slight hand gesture Silver
looks healthy rejuvenated

K enters the FRAME and sits next to Jay

K
(quietly)
Its going to be big Record-
breaking A lot of folks have flown
in from the Midwest and Canada

JAY
Great

K
Oh I want to introduce you to a
new member

When K waves a small Asian man enters the FRAME We
recognize him as KIM - the ex-Mirando truck driver He shakes
hands with Jay and returns to his seat in the back

K (CONTD)
He runs Mirandoisfuckedcom Just
arrived here from Seoul

Kim sits between Red and Blond and chatters incessantly like
a little bird

K (CONTD)
Hes a chatty one

Jay smiles and opens his bag to remove a black balaclava K
gives a signal to the other members and they all take out
their balaclavas The sound of drums and marching band music
grows louder as the demonstration site approaches

JAY
Im guessing most of the Mirando
big wigs will be there

K
Of course Including Nancy

Jay flashes a slick smile as he puts on his balaclava The
other members don theirs as well The remaining passengers
take out balaclavas too revealing themselves to be ALF
members A sea of black all around

The only people without balaclavas are two OLD LADIES who
look around with befuddled looks The bus loudly rumbles
through the bright sunlight and the music from the festival
reaches a crescendo

As the MUSIC continues the remaining CREDITS begin to CRAWL
OVER BLACK
