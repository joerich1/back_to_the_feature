station plays INDIAN POP MUSIC A KHANDA a Sikh talisman
hangs from the rear view mirror

ANGLE ON HIS ID CARD mounted on the Plexiglass barrier behind
his head We see his PHOTO and the name SINGH DARWAN

WIDE EXTERIOR - Darwans cab is parked near the entrance to
the QUEENSBOROUGH BRIDGE where he can see the always-
spectacular NIGHT SKYLINE OF MANHATTAN

The ON DUTY SIGN on top of Darwans cab LIGHTS UP He pulls
the taxi out and joins the line of CARS inching up to the
bridge

Close in on the cabs rooftop sign going on and off

continuously driving around the city (As if picking up and
dropping off passengers Until

herself onto the seat next to Ted Both are in their 40s

TED
You threw a bottle at me

( )
82113 4

Darwan drives on checking his rear mirror nervously The
womans face is contorted with anger the man is stoic

WENDY
Brilliant maneuver Inform me our
marriage is over in a public
restaurant so I cant make a scene
-- and you thought that would
work I wish my aim was better

Her arm swoops out to hit him he catches her wrist throws
her back

TED (contd)
On that rare occasion when you look
up from your books or your fucking

WENDY

(more sobs then )
What is she one of your students

He looks out the window ignoring her
WENDY (contd)
Thats as good as a yes Bet you
supervised her orals Bet she was

on her knees for that God damn
you --

She swings again and WHOP connects this time with his eye
He lets out a YELP pushes her away fending off her blows

DARWANS EYES widen in the rear mirror watching them
struggle

Ted breaks away shouting to the driver

TED
Pull over Let me out here

As the cab slows Wendy clings to Ted

WENDY
Please Ted Come home well talk--

TED
It wont do any good

WENDY
I dont understand -- why Why

The taxi stops near the curb
Ted is out the door SLAMMING it firmly He thrusts cash at
Darwan through the window

TED
Take her to 600 West 98th

Wendy throws open the door again to follow him Ted pushes it
closed blocking it with his body as he calls to Darwan

( )

82113 6

TED (contd)
Go Go

Darwan pulls the taxi away quickly The momentum bounces her
back on the cushion where she lets out a long wounded WAIL

Darwan maintains a pained silence as he drives the woman

home He glances now and then in the rear mirror to see her
crumpled up and SOBBING without restraint

EXT WENDYS HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

Darwan pulls up in front of a narrow three-story brownstone

DARWAN
We are here Number six hundred

Wendy stuffs a twenty in his tray and gets out Her face is
obscured but he can tell shes crying As she stumbles to her
door Darwan jumps out with the money

DARWAN (contd)
No please He paid me already --

But Wendy is already inside and the door SLAMS shut

INT FRONT HALL - WENDYS HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Wendy flicks on the LIGHT and stands numbly in the hall We
get a better look at her Fierce eyes in a soft vulnerable
face Attractive but careless about her looks

The hallway is lined with bookcases Piles of messengered
books and mail are on the hall table and a bowl full of keys
and coins Seen through an open door the living room is full
of dusty Danish-modern furniture and like the hall is
cluttered with books on shelves and on every surface

Wendys eyes fall to the two tennis racquets leaning against
the wall They lift to the framed PHOTO of her with Ted a
little girl (TASHA) between them laughing on top of some
mountain She shakes her head in mute disbelief

She walks mechanically to the coat closet Removing her

jacket she hangs it up then pauses at the sight of the
empty hanger for his coat

INT WENDYS BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER - NIGHT

She opens the door steps in and stares at the bed

82113 7

WENDYS POV (FANTASY) - Ted lounges in bed wearing an old t-
shirt grading test papers He doesnt look up RUNNING WATER
OS WE PAN TO THE OPEN BATHROOM DOOR Teds in there his
back to her bare butt peeking from under the torn t-shirt
brushing his teeth the faucet running FOOTSTEPS BEHIND
HER OS

WENDY turns toward the sound in the doorway

WENDYS POV - Teds going downstairs into the darknessA
beatThe front door CLOSES WITH A LOUD REPORT --

-- shattering her fantasy She starts to hyperventilate

gasping for breath Then she rushes past the empty bed into
the empty bathroom We hear her VOMITING into the toilet

EXT TAXI COMPANY - LATER - PRE-DAWN

Back in Queens Darwan returns the taxi He removes his
belongings and checks the rear seat He sees a PADDED
ENVELOPE ON THE FLOOR One of his passengers must have left
something

There is no name on the outside of the envelope The flap is
open He slips his hand in and pulls out a new HARDCOVER
BOOK A letter is clipped to the dustcover

We SKIM DOWN the letter as he reads The letterhead is a book
publisher addressed to a WENDY SHIELDS The New Yorker

EXT STREET RICHMOND HILL - LATER - EARLY AM

The envelope tucked under his arm Darwan walks wearily up a
residential street past small drab one-family homes built
in the 30s Only a few other people are on the street this
early all bearded MEN in turbans like Darwan jackets over
long shirts this is the Punjabi Sikh neighborhood in Queens

Darwan enters the basement apartment of a two-story clapboard
house unpainted in a decade

82113 8

INT BASEMENT APARTMENT - MINUTES LATER - EARLY AM 15

We TRACK WITH DARWAN through the one-bedroom apartment He
passes the open bathroom door where a SIKH MAN barechested
from his shower winds his turban around his long hair which
is knotted on top of his head

Darwan glances inside a tiny bedroom where ANOTHER SIKH MAN
is asleep in the one bed Darwans 23-year-old nephew PREET
dressed in construction clothes is rolling up his mattress

on the floor

DARWAN
(WHISPERS )
Preet

The boy doesnt hear at first his ears blocked by the
earbuds from the iPod in his pocket

DARWAN (contd)
Preet

Preet looks up smiling sheepishly as he pulls out the
earbuds He joins Darwan in the hallway

PREET
Hey I got another job Big
renovation four weeks -

DARWAN
(interrupts re iPod)
Where did you get that

PREET
I paid for it

DARWAN
Preet you must save your money

PREET
(grins)
Uncle D no I must have music

DARWAN
And turn that around

Darwan is referring to Preets head wrap which is knotted in
the back gangsta-style

DARWAN (contd)

If you cant wear it properly then
put on the dastaar turban

Preet wags his finger playfully under Darwans nose

PREET
Uncle D its past your bedtime

Darwan has to smile He raps his knuckle on Preets head and
lets him go

As Preet exits for work Darwan proceeds into the living
room where a THIRD SIKH MAN is rising from his bed on the
couch Too tired to talk Darwan nods at him taking his
place on the couch while the other man pads yawning to the
bathroom

Darwan PLACES THE PADDED ENVELOPE CAREFULLY ON THE TEA TABLE

then burrows under the blanket Darwan then starts
unravelling his turban

like grime But their dirt is
alive you know its rich its

move as if she doesnt hear it Finally Tasha turns off the
fire The WHISTLE DIES Tasha pours water in the mugs

DARWAN
I was a university professor like
my father

WENDY
Then why do you teach driving

DARWAN

For a better job I would have to
take off my turban shave my beard
People think I look dangerous But
this is how I know who I am And
here it is too easy to forget

WENDY
Dont you go back for visits

DARWAN
I can never go home to India Its
part of political asylum I could
not see my father before he died
last year

WENDY
I didnt get a chance to say
goodbye to my dad either

DARWAN
I missed my mothers funeral too
but that was when I was in prison
there

WENDY
(taken aback)
Why

DARWAN
For nothing For being a Sikh The
police had already killed my
brother They said he was a
terrorist and they had to shoot
him because he ambushed them but
it was a lie Then they punished
the rest of the family All of us
were tortured my father my uncle
even my mother They let my sister
alone because she was too young
Back then there was no justice for
Sikhs

WENDY
How long were you in prison

only cringe against her door witnessing his anger with no
idea of the cause

The car heads out of the parking lot

DARWAN (contd)
(to Jasleen)
We must take Wendy home first
(gestures out window)
Look here is America

Jasleen sees nothing outside but bleak concrete and sterile
streetlights through a scrim of humid exhaust

WENDY
Excuse me youve never met her

DARWAN
Shes from a village near where I
grew up My sister picked her out
for me

WENDY
(sitting back)
If my sister picked me a husband

banker

DARWAN
(sarcastic)
Yes you are better off
(mutters )
Thats why youre alone and crazy

WENDY
Listen just drop me at the subway

He SWERVES around ANOTHER CAR thrusting the women against
their doors while he shakes his finger back at Wendy
