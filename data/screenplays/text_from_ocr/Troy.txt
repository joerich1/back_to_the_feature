FADE IN

EXT THESSALIAN VALLEY - DAY 1

A mangy bone-thin DOG lopes across the broad valley
floor sniffing at the ground At first the scene
appears bucolic tall grass patches of wildflowers blue
sky above

But as the dog keeps running we see signs of conflict A
spear half imbedded in the earth rises at an angle A
bronze helmet cracked and bloodied lies on its side

The dog pauses to sniff the helmet then continues his
search Finally he stops hackles on his back rising
ears pricked up He growls and we see what the dog sees

Dozens of CROWS have descended into a shallow ravine
They squabble and peck clustered around something on the
ground

The dog growls louder and charges at the crows The black
birds flap away to safety shrieking in protest

A DEAD SOLDIER lies facedown in the ravine Whatever
armor he wore was stripped away leaving his body to the
elements

The dog walks slowly to the dead man sniffing at the
corpses hands The dog whines and licks the mans
fingers

Something in the air disturbs the dog who looks up And
now we hear it faintly in the distance HOOF BEATS and
chariot wheels marching men the clank of bronze armor
and weaponry

The dog runs abandoning his dead master

THE MYCENAEAN ARMY 1A

five thousand strong storms into the valley from the
south Armored with bronze breastplates helmets and
shields the soldiers glitter in the morning sun

Riding alongside the infantry are dozens of horse-drawn
CHARIOTS each holding a DRIVER a SPEARMAN and an
OFFICER

On the opposite side of the valley three thousand
THESSALONIAN SOLDIERS march into view The Thessalonians
are less disciplined their armor and weaponry less
impressive

1A

When each army reaches the battlefield they stop and stare
one another down two hundred yards distant

A MYCENAEAN CHARIOT AND A THESSALONIA CHARIOT 1B

emerge from their respective sides and meet at the center
of the field

AGAMEMNON king of the Mycenaeans rides in his chariot
with a DRIVER and a SPEARMAN Agamemnon holds a gold
SCEPTER symbol of command His breast plate is engraved
with an Alpha

His counterpart in the Thessalonian cart TRIOPAS does not project equal confidence He eyes the size of
the Mycenaean army with evident unease He holds his own
SCEPTER

Both kings step down from their chariots and approach each
other They stare at one another for several seconds
Agamemnon smiles and looks into the sky

The crows wheel overhead cawing

AGAMEMNON
Its a good day for the crows

TRIOPAS
I told you yesterday and Ill tell
you again today Remove your army
from my land

Agamemnon smiles again and turns to examine the valley

AGAMEMNON
I like your land I think well
stay
(beat)
I like your soldiers too They
fought bravely yesterday Not
well but bravely

TRIOPAS
Theyll never fight for you

AGAMEMNON
Thats what the Messenians said
too And the Arcadians And the
Epeians Theyre all fighting for
me now

1B

1B

TRIOPAS
You cant rule the whole world
Agamemnon Its too big Even for
you

Agamemnon surveys Triopass army

AGAMEMNON
I dont want to watch another
massacre Lets end this war in
the old manner
(beat)
Your best fighter against my best

For the first time Triopas looks hopeful

TRIOPAS
And if my man wins
AGAMEMNON
Well leave Thessaly for good

(beat)
Im a generous man If mine wins
you keep your throne But Thessaly
falls under my command to fight
with me whenever I call

Triopas considers before nodding He shouts to his army

TRIOPAS
Boagrius

The Thessalonians murmur and step aside A giant emerges
from their midst BOAGRIUS a foot taller than the other
men his face gouged with old knife scars He marches out
to his king

TRIOPAS
Here is my champion

Agamemnon raises his eyebrows as the giant comes closer

AGAMEMNON
(shouting to his army)
Achilles

The Mycenaeans murmur amongst themselves looking for
Achilles Nobody emerges Agamemnon frowns

TRIOPAS
Boagrius has this effect on many
heroes

1B 1B
AGAMEMNON
Be careful whom you insult old
king

An OFFICER on horseback gallops from the Mycenaean ranks
to the center of the field He bows his head to
Agamemnon

OFFICER
Achilles is not with the army

Triopas laughs and looks up at Boagrius who chuckles

AGAMEMNON
(furious)
Where is he
OFFICER

I sent a boy to look for him

EXT WOODS - DAY 2

A BOY on a roan HORSE gallops through the woods

EXT MYCENAEAN CAMP - DAY 3

The boy rides into the camp Scores of tents stand on the
banks of a river The only men around are COOKS tending
fires and ARMORERS mending armor and weapons

The boy dismounts at one large tent in the corner of the
camp He pulls open the tent flap and steps inside

INT ACHILLES TENT - CONTINUOUS 4

The boy pauses for a moment inside the tent eyes
adjusting to the dim light Evidently last night was a
wild party Jugs of wine are everywhere and the remains
of a large feast

Sleeping on a fur rug are two NAKED WOMEN and one NAKED
MAN tanned arms and legs entwined The boy sidesteps
shards of a broken jug He bends to tap the sleeping
mans shoulder

Before his fingers make contact a hand shoots out grabs
his wrist and pulls him to the rug The boy finds
himself flat on his back with a dagger to his throat

4

ACHILLES
Shh

The boy stares into the eyes of ACHILLES who seems
to have barely moved Somehow he managed to seize the boy
and put a knife to his throat without waking the women

ACHILLES
(whispering)
I was having a good dream
(beat)
A very good dream

The boy nods dumb with fear Achilles has the lean
efficient physique of a boxer His face and body are dark
from a summer spent in the sun

BOY
King Agamemnon sent me He
needs --

ACHILLES
Ill speak with your king in the
morning

BOY
But my lord -- it is morning

Achilles frowns He stands and walks naked to the tent
flap holds it open and stares at the empty encampment

BOY
Theyre waiting for you

EXT MYCENAEAN CAMP 5

Achilles prepares for battle strapping on his
breastplate The boy assists him fixing the bronze
greaves to his legs

BOY
Are the stories about you true
They say your mother is an immortal
goddess

Achilles lifts up his shield He slips his left forearm
into the leather straps on the inside of the shield

BOY
They say you cant be killed

5

ACHILLES
I wouldnt be bothering with the
shield then would I

BOY
The Thessalonian youre fighting
-- hes the biggest man Ive ever
seen

Achilles mounts the boys horse

BOY
I wouldnt want to fight him

ACHILLES
Thats why no one will remember
your name

Achilles gallops away leaving the boy standing alone

EXT THESSALIAN VALLEY 6

Agamemnon confers with his OFFICERS on the battlefield
including KING NESTOR his trusted advisor

When Achilles rides into view the Mycenaean soldiers
CHEER Some cry out his name Agamemnon and his officers
turn to watch Achilles dismount and approach them

AGAMEMNON
Perhaps we should have our war
tomorrow when youre better
rested

Achilles ignores the king and examines the waiting giant

AGAMEMNON
I should have you whipped for
impudence

Achilles wheels on the king

ACHILLES
Whos giving the whipping

He walks toward Agamemnon fingers curling over the hilt
of his sword Nestor slides in between Achilles and the
king

NESTOR
Achilles

Achilles nostrils flared eyes narrowed stares at
Agamemnon Neither man is willing to turn away

ACHILLES
(to Agamemnon)
Why dont you fight him yourself
Wouldnt that be a sight a king
who fights his own battles

NESTOR
Achilles

Achilles finally turns and looks at him

NESTOR
Look at the mens faces

Achilles surveys the faces of the battle-weary soldiers

NESTOR

You can save hundreds of them You
can end this war with a swing of
your sword

(beat)
Think how many songs theyll sing
in your honor

(beat)
Let them go home to their wives

The soldiers awed in his presence stare at Achilles He
finally turns and walks toward Boagrius

Agamemnon watches Achilles with undisguised hostility

AGAMEMNON
(to Nestor under
his breath)
Of all the warlords loved by the
gods I hate him most

NESTOR
We need him my king

AGAMEMNON
For now

6A ACHILLES 6A
When Achilles is forty yards from the giant Boagrius
turns to his army and shakes his spear over his head

They cheer slamming their bronze swords against their
bronze shields

6A

6A
Achilles keeps coming He looks up at the circling crows

Boagrius turns and throws his spear The bronze spearhead
glitters in the sun blazing straight for Achilles

Without breaking stride Achilles raises the shield The
spearhead blasts through the bronze skin of the shield
through the thick leather on the underside stopping
inches from Achilles face

Achilles keeps coming

Boagrius hoists a second spear and hurls it grunting with
effort Again Achilles raises his shield again the
spearhead tears through the shield but does not harm
Achilles

Achilles casts aside the shield and keeps coming

Boagrius unsheathes his tremendous bronze sword He opens
his mouth lets loose a battle cry and charges at
Achilles

When Boagrius raises his sword Achilles lunges forward
with terrifying speed It does not seem possible that he
could close the gap between them so quickly but he does
thrusting his sword straight through Boagrius
breastplate

Achilles pulls his sword from the giants chest and
continues walking toward the Thessalonian line never
looking back

Boagrius stares down at the hole in his breastplate
Blood pumps out pouring down the polished bronze He
topples over

The Mycenaean Army ERUPTS with exultant victory cries
Achilles now stands in front of the massed Thessalonian
troops He searches from face to face None of the
soldiers are willing to make eye contact with him

Finally Triopas steps out of the ranks

TRIOPAS
Who are you soldier

ACHILLES
Achilles son of Peleus

6A 6A

TRIOPAS
Achilles I wont forget the name

Triopas offers Achilles the heavy gold SCEPTER

TRIOPAS
The ruler of Thessaly carries this
scepter Give it to your king

ACHILLES
Hes not my king

Achilles walks west away from both armies The soldiers
watch him go in silence

EXT IONIAN SEA - DUSK 7

Were high above the wine-dark sea gliding north Soon
the Peloponnesian coast comes into view The only break
in the shoreline is the inlet of Laconia and we follow it
inland

The inlet ends in a natural harbor where several tall-
masted warships are beached sails unfurled oars locked
and rowing benches empty Dozens of smaller fishing boats
are scattered about the harbor

On top of the highest hill overlooking all Sparta stands
a thick-walled PALACE Torch-bearing SENTRIES wearing
plumed helmets and carrying long spears man their posts

MENELAUS (V0)
Princes of Troy on our last night
together Queen Helen and I salute
you

INT PALACE OF SPARTA - RECEPTION HALL - CONTINUOUS 8

MENELAUS king of Sparta stands at the head of a
massive table that spans the length of a hall lit by
torches A battle-scarred warrior Menelaus is already
halfway drunk

Beside Menelaus sits his wife HELEN wearing a white
gown head bowed half listening to her husband Fresh
flowers are woven into her hair Her beauty is so extreme
she seems to exist in a separate realm

8

The only woman in the room and the only one wearing white
Helen shines amidst the unwashed WARRIORS of Sparta and
Troy All sit at a table laden with platters of roasted
game birds whole fish octopi suckling pigs and bowls of
fruit

Menelaus holds his gold wine goblet in the air toasting
his honored guests HECTOR and PARIS Hector is not the best-looking man in the room nor the
largest but the intensity of his expression the regality
of his bearing confirms that he is a born leader

Paris is the best-looking man in the room by a long shot
Hes not paying attention to Menelaus Hes staring at
Helen

MENELAUS
Weve had our conflicts before
its true Weve fought many
battles Sparta and Troy And
fought well

Menelauss soldiers cheer drunkenly For a moment Helen
looks up and meets Pariss gaze

MENELAUS
But Ive always respected your
father Priam is a good man a
good king I respected him as an
adversary and I respect him now as
my ally

More cheering this time from the entire assembly

MENELAUS
Hector Paris young princes come
stand drink with me

Hector stands Paris does not Hes still staring at
Helen Hector nudges his brothers shoulder Paris
stands

MENELAUS
Let us drink to peace

Hector nods to Menelaus and raises his cup

HECTOR
Peace between Troy and Sparta

ll 8

The king and the princes drink deeply and slam their empty
cups to the table

MENELAUS
May the gods keep the wolves in the
hills and the women in our beds

All the men in the hall cheer and rise to their feet

GUESTS
To Sparta To Troy

A band of MUSICIANS strike up their instruments SERVANTS
roam the hall filling goblets with wine

POLYDORA one of Helens handmaidens leads a dozen
attractive YOUNG WOMEN into the banquet hall

The warriors howl at the sight of the women Soon each of
the handmaidens is flanked by drunken soldiers

Menelaus grabs Hector in a bear hug Hector gamely
accepts the embrace When the king releases him both men
spill a few drops of wine from their cups onto the floor

They drink the rest of their wine Menelaus grips
Hectors upper arm SERVANTS refill the cups

MENELAUS
A strong arm Thank the gods we
made peace -- Ive seen too many of

my men struck down with this arm

HECTOR
Never again I hope

MENELAUS
Only one man works a sword better
than you The son of Peleus the
Argonaut

HECTOR
Achilles

MENELAUS
That madman would throw a spear at
Zeus himself if the god insulted
him 8
Menelaus indicates Polydora who stares at Hector openly

MENELAUS
You see that one over there I
picked her just for you Shes a
little lioness

Menelaus grins at the girl who lowers her eyes and
smiles Helen notices this silent exchange but ignores
it conversing instead with another HANDMAIDEN who sits
beside her

HECTOR
Thank you My wife waits for me in
Troy

MENELAUS

My wife waits for me right there

He leans forward to whisper conspiratorially in Hectors
ear

MENELAUS
Wives are for breeding You
understand For making little
princes Come enjoy yourself
tonight

Helen stands and walks out of the reception hall
Menelaus does not notice Hector does He raises his cup
to Menelaus

HECTOR
You make excellent wine in Sparta

Menelaus laughs and drinks with Hector

Paris excuses himself from the Spartan generals hes been
speaking with and heads outside -- in the same direction
as Helen Hector watches with mounting agitation

INT HELENS CHAMBER - NIGHT 9
The room is lit by a dozen tall candles Helen removes
the flowers from her hair and drops them into a bowl of
water She hears a sound and looks up Paris stands in

the doorway

For several breaths they are silent staring at each
other

9 9

HELEN
You shouldnt be here

Paris closes the door behind him

PARIS
Thats what you said last night

HELEN
Last night was a mistake

PARIS
And the night before

Helen continues removing the flowers from her hair but she
cannot hide a half-smile

HELEN
Ive made many mistakes this week

He approaches her

PARIS
Do you want me to go

His hands are on her now sliding down her bare neck down
her back resting on her hips His mouth is very close to
her ear Helen closes her eyes

HELEN
(whispering)
Yes

Paris kisses her neck her ears her closed eyes The
tightness we saw in her face when she sat by her husbands
side is gone replaced by ecstasy

PARIS
(whispering)
Where should I go

She kisses him back now and theres a hunger in her
kisses something close to violence in her desire She
lifts off his tunic and pulls him nearer

HELEN
(whispering)
Away Far away

In a moment the white gown slips to her feet He stares
at her naked body in wonder He opens his mouth to speak
but she kisses him full on the lips They sink onto the
bed

il

INT PALACE - RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT 10

As more and more wine gourds are emptied the scene grows
rowdier An impromptu choir of Spartan and Trojan
soldiers drunkenly sing battle songs

Polydora sits on Menelauss lap She whispers in his ear
while he laughs and drains another cup of wine Bits of
roasted boar fleck his thick red beard

Hector sits nearby half engaged in conversation with
several Spartan generals Hes clearly not happy that his
brothers still missing

INT HELENS CHAMBER - NIGHT (LATER) 11

Helen lies naked on her bed In the candlelight her
flanks are mapped with copper trails of sweat She
watches Paris who stands bedside pulling on his clothes

PARIS
I have something for you

From his tunic he pulls a necklace of baby pearls threaded
with silver He sits beside her in bed

PARIS
Pearls from the sea of Propontis

Paris strings the pearls around her neck

HELEN
Theyre beautiful
(beat)
But I cant wear them Menelaus
would kill us both

PARIS
Dont be afraid of him

HELEN
Im not afraid of dying Im
afraid of tomorrow watching you
sail away and knowing youll never
come back

She runs her fingers across his jaw line

HELEN
Before you came to Sparta I was a
ghost I walked and I ate and I
swam in the sea but I was a ghost

il

PARIS
You dont have to fear tomorrow

Helen watches him unsure what he means

PARIS
Come with me

For a long moment they stare into each others eyes

HELEN
Dont play with me prince of Troy
Dont play

The sounds of footsteps and laughter outside the door
startle them Paris halfway unsheathes a KNIFE hanging
from his belt

Whoevers walking by the door passes without stopping
Paris sheathes his knife kneels beside the bed and takes
her hand

PARIS
If you come well never be safe
Men will hunt us and the gods will
curse us But Ill love you
Until the day they burn my body I
will love you

Helen stares into Paris eyes contemplating the
impossible

INT PALACE - COURTYARD - LATER

A group of TROJAN SOLDIERS lies on goatskins and furs

around a bonfire built in the middle of the courtyard
Some sleep some continue to drink and sing old Trojan
songs

Hector stands by the fire conferring with TECTON a
bull-necked captain of the elite Apollonian Guard

HECTOR
Make the proper offerings to
Poseidon before we sail We dont
need any more widows in Troy

TECTON
Goat or pig

HECTOR
Which does the Sea God prefer

il

12

TECTON
(smiling)
Ill wake the priest and ask him

Tecton bows and exits the courtyard Hector sees Paris
slinking past the bonfire sneaking toward his quarters

HECTOR
Paris

Paris turns smiles and waves acting as if he hadnt seen
Hector before He ambles over to join his brother

HECTOR
You should get to bed We wont
sleep on land again for weeks

PARIS
I have no trouble sleeping on the
seas The sea nymphs sing
lullabies to me

HECTOR
And who sang lullabies to you
tonight

Paris freezes for a moment but quickly regains his poise
PARIS

Tonight Tonight was the
fishermans wife A lovely

creature

HECTOR
I hope you didnt let the fisherman
catch you

PARIS

Hes more concerned with the fish

Paris smiles and starts to walk away but Hector holds him

HECTOR
You do understand why were in
Sparta

PARIS

For peace 12

HECTOR
And you do understand that
Menelaus King of Sparta is a
powerful man And that his
brother Agamemnon King of
Mycenae commands all the Greek
forces

PARIS
What does this have to do with the
fishermans wife

Hector seizes Pariss face between the palms of his hand
Not a violent gesture exactly but not gentle either

HECTOR
Paris Youre my brother and I
love you But if you do anything
to endanger Troy Ill rip your
pretty face from your pretty skull

He kisses Paris on the forehead

HECTOR
Get some sleep We sail in the
morning

Paris a bit shocked by the encounter stumbles away

EXT IONIAN SEA - DAY 13

The TROJAN SHIP sails over the waves

EXT SHIPS DECK - DAY 14

The winds are strong Nobody needs to row SAILORS tend
the sails or play dice

Hector stands in the bow leaning against the rail
whittling a WOODEN LION Paris joins him

PARIS
A beautiful morning Poseidon has
blessed our voyage

Hector looks at the blue sky for a moment

14

HECTOR
Sometimes the gods bless you in the
morning and curse you in the
afternoon

Paris watches his brother work the wood When Paris
speaks again his tone is more sober than weve heard it
before

PARIS
Do you love me brother

Hector rests his knife on the deck and smiles

HECTOR
What have you done now

PARIS
I need to show you something

Paris walks toward the staircase leading inside the ship
Hector watches him for a few seconds and then follows

INT TROJAN SHIP 15
Paris pauses in front of his cabin door

PARIS
Before you get angry with me --

HECTOR
Open the door

Paris opens the door Helen wearing a hooded robe sits

on the edge of a hammock swinging slightly She stands

Hector stares at her in disbelief He turns and glares at
Paris

HECTOR
If you werent my brother Id kill
you where you stand

PARIS
Hector --

Hector is already out the door Helen looks at Paris

HELEN
Well never have peace

PARIS
I dont want peace I want you

1

15
He kisses her -- a desperate hungry kiss the two of them
against the world -- then turns and follows his brother
INT PALACE OF SPARTA - HELENS BEDCHAMBER - DAY 16

Menelaus followed by ten SOLDIERS storms into Helens
room

INT HELENS BEDCHAMBER 1”

He finds Polydora polishing the queens jewelry Menelaus
grabs her arm roughly Shes terrified

MENELAUS
Where is she

POLYDORA
Who my king

Menelaus draws his sword

MENELAUS
I swear by the father of the gods
Ill gut you here if you dont tell
me

The handmaiden tries to speak but no words come out
Fortunately for her HIPPASUS a royal advisor
enters the room at that moment followed by an old
FISHERMAN HIPPASUS
She left with the Trojans my king

Menelaus stares at Hippasus who swallows and gestures at
the fisherman The fisherman looks as if hed rather be
fishing
HIPPASUS
The old man saw her board their
ship

Menelaus releases the handmaiden and stares at the
fisherman

MENELAUS
The Trojans

FISHERMAN
With the young prince Paris
She --

Menelaus holds up his hand The fisherman shuts up
Everyone watches the king waiting for an explosion but
the news -- strangely -- seems to focus him

MENELAUS
Get my ship ready

EXT TROJAN SHIP 18

Hector walks quickly toward the stern Paris right behind
him The PILOT mans the rudder

HECTOR
(to pilot)
Turn us around Back to Sparta

PARIS
Wait wait

Hector spins on his brother

HECTOR
You fool

PARIS
Listen to me --

Hector shoves his brother backwards The older brothers
physical power is obvious SAILORS watch in awed silence

HECTOR
Do you know what youve done Do
you know how many years our father
worked for peace How many
brothers and cousins he lost on the
battlefield

PARIS
I love her

The muscles in Hectors jaw bulge against his cheeks

HECTOR
Say another word and Ill break
your arm This is all a game for
you isnt it
(MORE)
( )

el

HECTOR (CONTD)
You roam from town to town bedding
merchants wives and temple maids -
- you think you know something
about love What about your
fathers love You spat on him
when you brought her on this ship
What about love of your country
Youd let Troy burn for this woman

Paris starts to speak but Hector raises a warning finger

HECTOR
I wont let you start a war for
her

PARIS

May I speak

(beat)
What you say is true Ive wronged
you Ive wronged our father If
you want to bring Helen back to
Sparta so be it But I go with
her

HECTOR
To Sparta Theyll kill you

PARIS
Then Ill die fighting

Hector laughs bitterly He grabs the collar of Pariss

tunic

HECTOR
That sounds heroic to you doesnt
it To die fighting Tell me
little brother have you ever
killed a man

PARIS
No

HECTOR
Have you ever even seen a man die
in combat

PARIS
No

Hectors face is flushed with anger Paris tries to look
away but Hector wont let him

HECTOR

Ive killed men brother Ive
watched them dying Ive heard them
dying Ive smelled them dying

(beat)
Theres nothing glorious about it
nothing poetic You think you want
to die for love but you know
nothing about dying You know
nothing about love

PARIS
All the same I go with her

Hector releases his brother He stares at the sea

PARIS
I wont ask you to fight my war

Hector shakes his head still staring into the waves

HECTOR
You already have

For a long time Hector is silent Finally he turns to the

pilot who awaits the princes command

HECTOR
To Troy

Hector walks away from his brother

EXT MYCENAE HARBOR - DAY
Three WARSHIPS are anchored in the harbor
Menelaus followed by Hippasus and a retinue of SOLDIERS

climbs the long stone staircase that leads to the walled
city of Mycenae a citadel hewn from the hilltop rock

INT MYCENAE CITADEL - THRONE ROOM - DAY

Menelaus and his followers enter the throne room
Treasures from various conquests fill the room statuary
and urns and intricate gold work Armed GUARDS stand at
their posts

20

Only Agamemnon is seated on a beautiful throne carved
from solid oak Two robed NOBLES are addressing him when
Menelaus enters -- they move away as the Spartans
approach

Agamemnon stands The two kings embrace

AGAMEMNON
Your messenger came two days ago
I know what happened

Menelauss face darkens his rage barely submerged

MENELAUS
I want her back

AGAMEMNON
Of course you do Shes a
beautiful woman

MENELAUS
I want her back so I can kill her
with my own two hands I wont
rest until Ive burned Troy to the

ground
AGAMEMNON
(smiling)
I thought you wanted peace with
Troy
MENELAUS

I should have listened to you

AGAMEMNON
Peace is for the women and the
weak Empires are forged by war

MENELAUS
All my life Ive stood by your
side fought your enemies Youre
the eldest you reap the glory --
this is the way of the world But
have I ever complained brother
Have I ever asked you for anything

AGAMEMNON
Never Youre a man of honor
Everyone in Greece knows this

el 20

MENELAUS
The Trojans spat on my honor An
insult to me is an insult to you

AGAMEMNON
And an insult to me is an insult to
all Greeks

MENELAUS
Will you go to war with me
brother

Menelaus reaches out his hand Agamemnon looks into his
eyes Finally he nods and clasps hands with his brother

INT MYCENAE CITADEL - THRONE ROOM - NIGHT 21

Agamemnon paces the vast torch-lit room Nestor sits at
a wooden table Spread out on the table before him is a
rough map of Greece and environs painted on a tanned goat
skin

AGAMEMNON
I always thought my brothers wife
was a foolish woman But shes
proven to be very useful Nothing
unifies a people like a common
enemy

NESTOR
The Trojans have never been
conquered Some say they cant be
conquered

AGAMEMNON

I havent tried yet

(beat)
Old King Priam thinks hes
untouchable behind his high walls
He thinks the Sun God will protect
him But the gods only protect the
strong

(points at map)
If Troy falls I control the
Aegean

NESTOR
Hector commands the finest army in
the east And Troy is built to
withstand a ten-year siege

el

el

AGAMEMNON

There wont be a ten-year siege
Ill attack them with the greatest
force the world has ever seen I
want all the kings of Greece and
all their armies

(beat)
Send emissaries in the morning

Nestor stands and prepares to leave

Agamemnon

NESTOR
One last thing
(beat)
We need Achilles and his Myrmidons

shakes his head

AGAMEMNON
Achilles cant be controlled Hes
as likely to fight us as the
Trojans

NESTOR
We dont need to control him We
need to unleash him The man was
born to end lives

AGAMEMNON

Yes hes a gifted killer but he
follows no king He threatens
everything Ive built

(beat)
Before me Greece was nothing a
province of warlords and cattle
raiders Ive brought all the
Greek kingdoms together -- with the
sword when necessary with a treaty
when possible Ive created a
nation out of fire-worshippers and
snake-eaters

(beat)
I build the future Nestor
Achilles is the past a man who
fights for no flag a man loyal to
no country

Nestor waits a respectful moment before replying

el el

NESTOR

Your words are true But how many
battles have we won off the edge of
his sword

(beat)
This will be the greatest war the
world has ever seen We need the
greatest warrior

Agamemnon thinks about it pacing the room Finally --

AGAMEMNON
Theres only one man hell listen
to

NESTOR

Ill send a ship in the morning

EXT ITHACA - DAY 22

A lean bearded SHEPHERD sits on a hillside looking
over the Ionian sea

Beside him sits his faithful hunting dog ARGOS They
watch a troop of EMISSARIES climb the steep hill The
emissaries are panting for breath by the time they reach
the hilltop

EMISSARY 1
Greetings brother We were told
King Odysseus is here in the hills

SHEPHERD
Odysseus That old bastard drinks
my wine and never pays

EMISSARY 2
You ought to respect your king
friend

SHEPHERD
Respect him Id like to punch him
in the nose Hes always pawing at
my wife trying to tear her clothes
off

The emissaries embarrassed begin walking away The
shepherd watches them go

22
SHEPHERD
(to Argos the dog)
I hope Agamemnons generals are
smarter than his emissaries

Emissary 1 turns to look at the shepherd

EMISSARY 1
What did you say

The shepherd scratches behind Argoss ears The dog wags
his tail happily

SHEPHERD
You want me to help you fight the
Trojans

EMISSARY 1
Youre --

Emissary 1 exchanges glances with his compatriots
Theyre confused Finally the chastened emissaries bow

EMISSARY 1
Forgive us King Odysseus

Odysseus stands and looks down at his dog

ODYSSEUS
Well Im going to miss my dog

EMISSARY 2
King Agamemnon has a favor to ask
of you
Odysseus smiles and rubs his dogs head

ODYSSEUS
Of course he does
EXT SHASIDE CLIFF - LATE AFTERNOON 25
Achilles stands in the ruins of an ivy-covered temple on a
cliff above the sea sparring with his cousin Patroclus Both men wield wooden practice swords

Patroclus is a talented lean flashy young fighter His
sword whirls in the air like a thing alive

Achilles by contrast is the apotheosis of the efficient
combatant wasting no energy waiting for weakness

23

Patroclus presses in on the attack Achilles tilts his
head to avoid one thrust side-steps to avoid another
Spying a momentary opening he lunges forward and taps
Patroclus belly with the tip of his wood sword

ACHILLES
Youre getting fat cousin

Patroclus grins and relaunches his attack sword spinning
with blazing speed Achilles ducks beneath an arcing
swing and sword-taps Patroclus on the back

ACHILLES
Fancy swordplay The girls must be
impressed

Patroclus grunts and charges in again This time a
genuine duel develops featuring splendid repartee and
parrying

PATROCLUS
A little nervous arent you

ACHILLES
Terrified

Achilles raises his right hand and Patroclus lifts his
sword to parry the blow -- but Achilles no longer holds
his sword in his right hand

Sword in hisleft hand Achilles taps Patroclus on the
chest Patroclus stares down at the wood blade

PATROCLUS
You told me never to switch sword
hands

Achilles rolls his head to loosen his neck

ACHILLES
By the time you know how to do it
you wont be following my orders
anymore

Achilles tosses aside the sparring sword He cocks his
head as if listening to some distant sound Patroclus
oblivious to the noise practices his swordplay

Achilles foot curls around the wood shaft of one of the
spears lying on the ground In one impossibly fast
motion he flips the spear into the air with his foot
catches it and throws in the opposite direction from
where he was looking 23

The bronze warhead blazes between the temples walls and
drives into the trunk of an old fir

Only now do we see Odysseus leading a black horse
standing inches from the quivering shaft of the spear
blocking his path He stares at the spear for a moment
before ducking his head under the shaft and walking
forward

ODYSSEUS
(smiling)
Your reputation for hospitality is
fast becoming legend

ACHILLES
I dont like that smile my friend
Its the smile you smile when you
want me to fight in another war
(beat)
Patroclus my cousin -- Odysseus
king of Ithaca

ODYSSEUS
Patroclus son of Menoetius

The boy nods Odysseus grips Patrocluss shoulder

ODYSSEUS
I knew your parents well I miss
them

Patroclus nods again looking at his feet

ODYSSEUS
Now you have this one watching over
you eh Learning from Achilles
himself -- every boy in Greece must
be jealous
(to Achilles)
We need to talk

ACHILLES
Tell me youre not here at
Agamemnons bidding

Odysseus hesitates Achilles shakes his head

ACHILLES
How many times have I done the
savage work for the King of Kings
And when has he ever shown me the
respect Ive earned 23

ODYSSEUS
Im not asking you to fight for
him Im asking you to fight for
the Greeks

ACHILLES
Why Are the Greeks tired of
fighting each other

ODYSSEUS
For now

ACHILLES
The Trojans never did anything to
me

ODYSSEUS

They insulted Greece

ACHILLES
They insulted one Greek a man who
couldnt hold on to his wife What
business is that of mine

ODYSSEUS
Your business is war my friend

ACHILLES

(angry)
Is it Am I the whore of the
battlefield Can my sword be
bought and sold

(beat calmer)
I dont want to be remembered as a
tyrants mercenary

ODYSSEUS
Forget Agamemnon Fight for me
My wife will feel much better if
she knows youre by my side Ill
feel much better

PATROCLUS
Is Ajax going to fight in Troy
ODYSSEUS
Of course Youve heard of Ajax
eh
PATROCLUS

They say he can fell an oak tree
with one swing of the axe 23

ACHILLES
Trees dont swing back

Odysseus chuckles but hes alert to the boys enthusiasm

ODYSSEUS
Were sending the largest fleet
that ever sailed -- a thousand
ships

PATROCLUS
A thousand ships Prince Hector
is he as good a warrior as they
say

ODYSSEUS

The best of all the Trojans Some
say hes better than all the
Greeks too

(beat)
Even if your cousin doesnt come
Patroclus I hope youll join us
We could use a strong arm like
yours

Patroclus beams with pride and looks at his cousin

Achilles wraps his arm around Odysseuss shoulders and
leans closer to the Ithacan The embrace is friendly but
theres no mistaking the power in Achilles grip

ACHILLES
Play your tricks on me if youd
like But leave my cousin out of
it

ODYSSEUS
You have your sword I have my
tricks We play with the toys the
gods give us

Odysseus goes back to his horse and mounts

ODYSSEUS
We sail for Troy in three days
(beat)
This war will never be forgotten
Nor will the heroes who fight in
it

Patroclus eager but frustrated watches him ride away

EXT BEACH - SUNSET 24

Achilles makes his away across the sandy hillocks He
spies a woman in the distance

EXT SEASHORE - SUNSET 25

Achilles finds his mother THETIS standing in the
surf Her long black hair is streaked with gray She
sees a shell that she likes and stoops down to pick it up

ACHILLES
Mother

Thetis turns and smiles at Achilles
THETIS
I thought Id make you another
seashell necklace
ACHILLES
I havent worn a seashell necklace
since I was a boy
Thetis looks at Achilles bare neck

THETIS
Dont you like them anymore

Achilles spots a good shell He hands it to his mother

THETIS
Oh thats a pretty one

She surveys the beach for more pretty shells

ACHILLES
They want me for another war

Thetis bends down and scoops up a silvery shell

ACHILLES
Are you listening

THETIS
Yes my sweet Another war

ACHILLES
Patroclus wants to go

THETIS
Patroclus has never seen war

25 25

Thetis examines the shells in the palm of her hand
Finally she stands and looks at her son

THETIS
If you stay here with me with
your family youll have a long
peaceful life Youll marry
youll have children and your
children will have children
They1l love you and when youre
gone theyll remember you But
when your children are dead and
their children after them your
name will be lost

Thetis reaches up to touch her sons cheek Her eyes are
clear her voice steady She speaks these lines with no
hesitation no doubt

THETIS
If you go to Troy no one will earn
more glory than you Men will tell
stories of your victories for
thousands of years The world will
remember your name

Achilles stares at her his eyes burning These are words
hes wanted to hear since the day he was born His mother
waits a moment before speaking again The words hurt her

THETIS
But if you go to Troy youll never
come home Youll die there

ACHILLES
And you know this mother

THETIS
I know it

Achilles looks out to the sea Thetis tears in her eyes
smiles bravely

THETIS
Whenever your father came home from
war hed stare at the sea just
like that
(beat)
He never stayed for long

In the distance Achilles sees a white sail He fixates on
the lonely spot of white on the endless expanse of dark
water

EXT AEGEAN SEA - DAY 26

We soar above the greatest armada the world has ever seen

The princes return is a holiday for the Trojans
Thousands of ONLOOKERS line the road cheering Other
well-wishers standing on the roofs of houses throw
flower petals

Paris holds Helens hand and occasionally whispers in her
ear pointing out various sights but Helen looks nervous

People in the crowd mystified by her appearance point at
her and whisper amongst themselves

Helen holds her head high and pretends to ignore the
murmurs and stares Hector looks at her She carries
herself like a queen -- but shes gripping Pariss hand
with white knuckles

nurse Hector stares into the boys wondering eyes and
puts his finger in the boys hand

Both Helen and Priam now look at Paris

PARIS

If Priam is disturbed by this revelation his face doesnt
betray it He leans forward and kisses the former queen
on both cheeks Helen didnt know what to expect -- shes
flustered and gratified at the same time

archway looking over the city Hector sits at a table
that could seat fifty men

PRIAM
Its the will of the gods
Everything is in their hands
(beat)
But Im surprised you let him bring
her

HECTOR
If Id let him fight Menelaus for
her youd be burning a sons body
instead of welcoming a daughter

Priam closes his eyes at these words

PRIAM
We could send peace envoys to
Menelaus

HECTOR

You know Menelaus Hed spear your
envoys heads to his gate

PRIAM

What would you have me do
HECTOR

Put her on a ship and send her

home

PRIAM
When you were very young you came

healer said you wouldnt last the
night I went down to Apollos

Paris is a fool sometimes I know
that But Ill fight a thousand

PARIS
You left your home for me

HELEN
Sparta was never my home My

Paris excited with his new-hatched plan barely listens

PARIS

palaces for us no more servants
We dont need any of that

HELEN
And your family

PARIS

a war

HELEN
Menelaus wont give up Hell

PARIS

Helen stands and kisses him on the lips

HELEN
You dont know Menelaus You dont
know his brother Theyll burn
every house in Troy to find us
Theyll never believe weve left --
and even if they do theyll burn
Troy for spite

Paris considers her words and finally nods

Hector spurs his horse and races toward the invaders
followed by his twenty men

The other sixty Apollonians gallop to Ajaxs landing spot

EXT TEMPLE OF APOLLO - CONTINUOUS 61

Achilles gazes at the sky as if waiting for the sun to
blast him for blasphemy Nothing happens

Hearing hoofbeats Achilles turns and spots Hector and his
men two hundred yards away

ACHILLES
(to Eudorus)
Get inside the temple warn the
men

EKudorus hurries to warn his comrades

ACHILLES
Eudorus Wait wait a moment

The Myrmidon captain stops Achilles hefts a spear
judges the distance and throws

One hundred yards from Achilles the spearhead finds its
mark Tectons breastplate Tecton is knocked from his
horse and skewered to the ground He clutches at the
wooden shaft not comprehending his fate

Hector reins in his horse and stares at his fallen
captain The man is finished Hector turns to look at
Achilles

Eudoruss eyes are wide No other man alive could have
thrown a spear that far or that accurately

61

ACHILLES
Now you can go

Eudorus runs inside the temple

Hector kicks his horse and gallops toward Achilles His
men cry out and follow him Achilles waits Hector
raises his own spear When he is fifty yards away he
throws

At the very last moment Achilles bends his head to one
side an almost lackadaisical movement The spear rips
through the air occupied by Achilles head half a moment
before

Achilles smiles

Hector draws his sword and charges his men right behind
him Achilles walks with insulting insouciance into the
temple

A series of high steps lead inside the temple Hector and
the Trojans dismount and proceed cautiously to the temple

EXT TROJAN BEACH - DAY 62

An arrow sticks out of Ajaxs leg but he doesnt seem to
notice it He bulls forward giant shield held in front
and slams into the Trojan ranks

Where Achilles is all grace and speed Ajax is brute
force Parrying his blows is useless his battle axe
splits bronze shields bronze swords bronze helmets

The sound of his axe carving through a breastplate and the
man beneath the breastplate is like nothing else on earth

As Ajax drops another Trojan he lifts his ax to the
heavens

AJAX
I am Ajax breaker of stones
widow-maker of Salamis Look upon
me Trojans and despair

The Apollonians join the fight against the Greeks The
Guards are far better than the archers at hand-to-hand
combat

INT TEMPLE OF APOLLO - DAY 63

Hector and his men enter the temple Hyes adjusting to
the gloomy light they gingerly advance All is quiet
Evidence of looting is everywhere

At the back of the temple stairs lead up to the altar
room Hector walks toward the stairs Blood trickles
down the steps Hector raises his eyes

Achilles stands atop the staircase both hands wrapped
around the hilt of his sword the sword point resting on
the top step He stares down at Hector

WAR CRIES explode through the temple The Myrmidons burst
from their hiding places and rush the Trojans

Hector is an obvious target Two Myrmidons charge him
their spears leveled

If Achilles is the apotheosis of martial grace Hector is
something altogether different -- a man of ordinary gifts
who has become an extraordinary warrior by dint of
experience endless training and powerful intelligence

As the Myrmidons charge he waits At the last moment he
swings his sword slicing both spearheads from their
shafts The Myrmidons stare at their decapitated spears

Hector doesnt give them a chance to recover He pounces
sword flashing and both men fall to the temple floor

Achilles watches from the top step Hector begins running
up the stairs Achilles disappears inside the altar room

Another Myrmidon bounds up the stairs after Hector The
prince wheels about and kicks the Myrmidon in the
breastplate The soldier tumbles down the steps Hector
continues up the stairs

EXT TROJAN BEACH - DAY 64

As more Greek ships make landfall the Apollonian officer
sees that their position is no longer defensible

APOLLONIAN OFFICER
Back to the city Back to the
city

The Trojans begin to retreat The archers still turn to
fire whenever theres time Mounted Guards haul fleeing
archers onto their horses

INT ALTAR ROOM - DAY 65

Hector finds the bodies of two PRIESTS They lie on the
stone floor limbs splayed throats slit

Sitting atop the altar half-hidden by the shadows is
Achilles Hes a terrible sight to behold splattered
with blood his bronze sword still dripping

ACHILLES
You must be very brave or very
stupid to come after me alone
(beat)
You must be Hector

Hector stares at Achilles a moment before kneeling by the
dead priests bodies

ACHILLES
A private audience with the prince
of Troy Im flattered Do you
know who I am

HECTOR
These priests werent armed

Hector closes the eyes of the murdered priests Achilles
jumps down from the altar and looks at the bodies

ACHILLES
I didnt kill them Cutting old
mens throats -- theres no honor
in that
HECTOR
Honor
(spits)

Children and fools fight for honor
I fight for my country

Hector charges Achilles dances back staying just out of
reach Achilles looks relaxed almost playful

HECTOR
Fight me

ACHILLES
Why kill you prince of Troy with
no one here to see you fall

Achilles backs out of an archway opening onto the bright
day outside Hector follows

EXT TEMPLE OF APOLLO - CONTINUOUS 66
Down at the beach scores of Greek ships are on the sand

HECTOR
Why did you come here

Achilles gestures at the invading flotilla

ACHILLES
Theyll be talking about this war
for a thousand years

HECTOR
In a thousand years even the dust
from our bones will be gone

ACHILLES
Yes prince But our names will
remain

A band of bloodied Myrmidons led by Eudorus emerges from
the temple Hector surrounded by enemies warily backs
off

EUDORUS
(to Achilles)
The Trojans are dead

ACHILLES
Go home prince Drink some wine
Make love to your wife Tomorrow
well have our war

HECTOR
You speak of war as if its a game
But how many wives wait at Troys
gate for husbands theyll never see
again

ACHILLES
Perhaps your brother can comfort
them I hear hes good at charming
other mens wives

Hector stares at Achilles and the Myrmidons for another
moment before walking away

EUDORUS
Why did you let him go

ACHILLES
Its too early in the day for
killing princes

EXT TROJAN BEACH - DAY 67

Thousands of Greek soldiers on the beach watch as the
Trojans retreat many of the archers riding behind their
Apollonian saviors

Hector mounts his horse and rides back toward the city

When the Greeks see Achilles climbing onto the temples
roof they stare in awe silent

Achilles raises his bloodied bronze sword toward the sun
The CLAMOR that erupts from the beach is deafening

Thousands of men cheering and yelling his name Achilles
Achilles

EXT AGAMEMNONS SHIP - DAY 68

Agamemnon still aboard his ship waits for the gangplank
to be lowered His dark eyes are cold and hateful as he
listens to the men cheering

EXT BEACH ENCAMPMENT - LATER 69

Soldiers tug more and more ships onto the sand From the
landed ships primitive cranes are already beginning to
lower boxes of provisions military materiel and horses

Achilles walks across the beach carrying his helmet
accepting the congratulations of the troops Ajax
shirtless strides over

AJAX
Achilles

Achilles halts For a moment there seems to be tension in
the air Everyone watches Ajax gives Achilles a bear
hug

AJAX
Youre as fearless as a god

ACHILLES
The gods are immortal What do
they have to fear
Ajax laughs and releases Achilles

AJAX
Im honored to go to war with you

Achilles nods and grips the big mans thick arm

ACHILLES

I dont have to worry about my back
with you behind me

Achilles continues walking He sees Odysseus walking down

a gangplank from his ship to the beach

ACHILLES
(calling out)
If you sailed any slower the war
would be over

ODYSSEUS
I dont mind missing the beginning
of the war -- as long as Im here

at the end

Achilles smiles and keeps walking He arrives at the
Myrmidons newly established base Patroclus Eudorus
and the other surviving Myrmidons greet Achilles

EUDORUS
We have something to show you

Achilles follows Eudorus and the grinning Myrmidons to a
large tent twenty yards inland from their beached ship
few Myrmidons hammer the last tent pegs deep into the
sand

Eudorus holds open the tent flap Achilles looks at his
captain for a moment before entering the tent

INT ACHILLES TENT - CONTINUOUS

No rugs have been laid down yet so loot from the temple
has been stacked on the sand gold chalices black
amphorae woven tapestries goatskins filled with sacred
wine

But Achilles does not look at this plunder Bound by the
wrists to the center pole of the tent is Briseis dressed
in her white robes

Terrified but trying to retain her composure she returns
Achilles stare Robes torn hair disheveled bleeding
from the lip she still possesses her innate dignity and
strength Something changes in Achilles eyes when he
looks at her

A

70

EUDORUS
The men found her hiding in the
temple They thought shed
please you

ACHILLES
Leave us

EKudorus bows and exits

Achilles pulls a small sharp knife from his belt
Briseis stares at the blade

Achilles walks over to her and cuts the ropes that bind
her She sits back rubbing the chafed skin of her
wrists still watching Achilles He sheathes his knife

ACHILLES
Whats your name

Briseis stares at him but doesnt answer Achilles
becomes aware for the first time that hes covered in
blood He wipes a hand across his face Briseis looks
about the tent as if searching for a way out

ACHILLES
Youre safer in this tent than out
there Believe me

BRISEIS
You killed Apollos priests

ACHILLES
Ive killed men in five countries
But never a priest

BRISEIS
Then your men did
(beat)
The Sun God will have his
vengeance

Achilles removes his bronze grieves

ACHILLES
Whats he waiting for

Briseis is stunned by such blunt blasphemy but she cant
take her eyes off him because Achilles after all is
Achilles

BRISEIS
The right time to strike 70
Achilles removes his breastplate

ACHILLES
His priests are dead and his
acolytes a captive
(beat)
I think your god is afraid of me

Briseis laughs bitterly

BRISEIS
Afraid Apollo is master of the
sun He fears nothing

Achilles nods and looks around the dark tent

ACHILLES
Then where is he

Briseis has no answer Achilles smiles and she looks
away

A bucket of hot water sits beside a washcloth Achilles
wets the cloth and begins to scrub the blood from his
body

BRISEIS
Youre nothing but a killer You
dont know anything about the gods

ACHILLES
You havent seen twenty summers and
you think you know my heart I
know more about the gods than
priests could ever teach you
(beat)
Youre royalty arent you

Briseis says nothing Achilles smiles again

ACHILLES
Youve spent years talking down to
men you must be royalty Whats
your name

(beat)
Even the servants of Apollo have
names
BRISEIS
Briseis

ACHILLES
Are you afraid Briseis

Briseis is quiet for a moment She watches Achilles with
a mixture of fear and curiosity

BRISEIS
Should I be

EUDORUS (0S)
(calling from outside
the tent)
My lord --

ACHILLES
What is it

EKudorus sticks his head inside the tent

EUDORUS
King Agamemnon requests your
presence

ACHILLES
Why would I want to look at him
when I can look at her

EUDORUS
All the kings are there
celebrating the victory

Achilles stands

ACHILLES
Give me a moment

EKudorus withdraws

A long beat while Achilles studies
her

ACHILLES
You dont need to fear me girl

Youre the only Trojan who can say
that

EXT AGAMEMNONS TENT - LATER 71
Two muscular GUARDS stand by the opening to Agamemnons
tent Achilles wearing clean clothes doesnt bother
waiting for the guards permission to enter he brushes
past them and through the tent flap

INT AGAMEMNONS TENT - CONTINUOUS 72

The largest tent on the beach Agamemnons command
quarters are a lush affair decorated with the spoils of a
dozen wars Several AIDES-DE-CAMP bustle in and out on
various errands The Greek kings are here Odysseus
Ajax Menelaus etc

Agamemnon sits on a heavy wood throne garishly inlaid
with gold mother-of-pearl and precious stones

Triopas king of Thessaly kneels before Agamemnon

TRIOPAS
Youve won a great victory King of
Kings No one thought the Trojan
beach could be captured so easily

He hands Agamemnon a ceremonial dagger with a gold hilt

AGAMEMNON
A beautiful gift Triopas You
will be among the first to walk the
streets of Troy tomorrow

Triopas stands and bows Achilles has watched this
exchange with disbelief He glances at Odysseus who
shrugs Now Nestor king of the Pylians kneels before
Agamemnon and hands him an urn decorated with painted
warriors

NESTOR
My father Neleus had this urn made
to commemorate his victory at
Cyparisseis I present it to you
in honor of an even more memorable
victory

AGAMEMNON
Thank you old friend Tomorrow
well eat supper in the gardens of
Troy

Nestor stands and bows Agamemnon places the dagger and
urn beside a pile of other luxurious gifts As the kings
file out of the tent Odysseus clasps Achilles shoulder
and speaks to him out of the others earshot

ODYSSEUS
War is young men dying and old men
talking You know this Ignore
the politics

72

Odysseus exits the tent Agamemnon deigns to notice
Achilles waiting for him

AGAMEMNON
(to his aides)
Leave us

The aides exit leaving Achilles and Agamemnon alone
Achilles eyes the pile of gifts

ACHILLES
Apparently youve won some great
victory

AGAMEMNON

Ah perhaps you didnt notice The
Trojan beach belonged to Priam in
the morning It belongs to
Agamemnon in the afternoon

ACHILLES
You can have the beach I didnt
come here for sand

AGAMEMNON

No you came because you want your
name to last through the ages

(beat)
A great victory was won today --
but the victory is not yours
Kings did not kneel to Achilles
Kings did not bring homage to
Achilles

ACHILLES
The battle was won by soldiers
The soldiers know who fought

AGAMEMNON

History remembers the kings not
the soldiers

(beat)
Tomorrow well batter down the
gates of Troy Ill build
monuments to victory on every
island of Greece and carve
Agamemnon in the stone My name
will last forever Your name is
written in the sand for the waves
to wash away

ACHILLES
First you need the victory 72
Achilles turns to leave

AGAMEMNON
One more thing son of Peleus

Achilles stops

ACHILLES
I dont want to hear my fathers
name from your mouth

AGAMEMNON
The first pick of the battles
spoils always goes to the
commander Your men sacked the
temple of Apollo yes

ACHILLES
You want gold Take it its my
gift to honor your courage Take
what you want

AGAMEMNON
I already have Aphareus Haemon

Two battle-scarred soldiers APHAREUS and HAEMON drag
Briseis into the tent Her face is bruised -- clearly
shes been slapped around

AGAMEMNON
The spoils of war Tonight Ill
have her give me a bath And then
-- who knows

Achilles draws his sword

ACHILLES
(to the soldiers)
I have no quarrel with you
brothers But youll never see
home again if you dont let her go

The soldiers hesitate then draw their own swords
Achilles advances on them

AGAMEMNON
Guards

The two sentries rush into the tent swords drawn
Achilles is surrounded He raises his sword 72

BRISEIS
Stop

Everyone stops and looks at the girl Despite her torn
robes her noble bearing and authoritative tone command
respect

BRISEIS
Too many people have died today

She looks at the various men in the room and finally
addresses Achilles

BRISEIS
If killing is your only talent
thats your curse But I dont
want anyone dying for me

Everyone is quiet until Agamemnon laughs

AGAMEMNON
Mighty Achilles silenced by a
slave girl

ACHILLES
Shes not a slave

AGAMEMNON
She is now

Achilles eyes are flat and merciless

ACHILLES
Before my time is done King of
Kings I will look down on your
corpse and smile

Achilles turns and leaves the tent

INT PRIAMS MEETING HALL - NIGHT 76

Priam stands by the rooms open archway Beyond the city
he sees his beach occupied by the tremendous Greek force

Hector Paris and several of Troys leading GENERALS
ARISTOCRATS and PRIESTS sit around the long table One of
the generals GLAUCUS pounds the table with his
fist

GLAUCUS
If they want a war well give them
a war Id match the best of Troy
against the best of Greece any day

VELIOR a big-bellied nobleman shakes his head

VELIOR
The best of Greece outnumber the
best of Troy two to one

GLAUCUS
So what do you suggest we
surrender the city let the Greeks
slaughter our men and rape our
wives

Velior looks at Paris until the prince returns his gaze

VELIOR
I suggest diplomacy The Greeks
came here for one thing Lets be
honest my friends Trojans are
burning on the pyre right now
because of one youthful
indiscretion

Paris looks away from Velior

PRIAM
Glaucus youve fought with me for
forty years Can we win this war

GLAUCUS
Our walls have never been breached
Our archers are the best in the
world And we have Hector His
men would fight the shades of
Tartarus if he commanded We can
win

ARCHEPTOLEMUS High Priest of Troy wearing a long
white robe embroidered with gold thread now raises his

voice

ARCHEPTOLEMUS
I spoke with two farmers today
They saw an eagle flying with a
serpent clutched in its talons
(beat)
This is a sign from Apollo We
will win a great victory tomorrow
Troy is the eagle The Greeks --

HECTOR
Bird signs You want to plan our
strategy based on bird signs

PRIAM
Hector Show respect When
Archeptolemus prophesied four years
of drought we dug deeper wells
The drought came and we had water
to drink The high priest is a
servant of the gods

HECTOR

And Im a servant of Troy

(beat)
Ive always honored the gods
father You know that But today
I fought with a Greek who
desecrated the statue of Apollo
Apollo didnt strike the man down

(beat)
The gods wont fight this war for
us 76

PARIS
There wont be a war
(he stands)
This is not a conflict of nations
Its a dispute between two men
And I dont want to see another
Trojan die because of me

PRIAM
Paris --

PARIS
Tomorrow morning I will challenge
Menelaus for the right to Helen
The winner will take her home The
loser will burn before nightfall

Paris leaves the room The others sit in stunned silence

GLAUCUS
Does he have a chance

Everyone looks at Hector who meditates before answering

HECTOR
I want our army outside the gate in
the morning Agamemnon wont let
this war end with a duel

EXT PALACE GARDEN - NIGHT 77

Priams gardens are wondrous palm trees grow in the
courtyard flowered vines climb the walls Aeolian harps
chime in the breeze

Priam and Paris sitting on a bench facing a statue of
Aphrodite The king holds a cloth-wrapped bundle in his
lap

PARIS
Father I Im sorry for the pain
Ive caused you I --

PRIAM
Do you love her

Paris looks up at the statue of Aphrodite

77

PARIS

Youre a great king because you
love your country so much Every
blade of grass every grain of
sand every rock in the river --
you love all of Troy

(beat)
Thats the way I love Helen

Priam nods and contemplates the goddess of beauty

PRIAM
Ive fought many wars in my time
Some were fought for land some for
power some for glory
(beat)
I suppose fighting for love makes
more sense than all the rest

Paris says nothing but his fathers words seem to relieve
a great burden from his shoulders

PRIAM
But I wont be the one fighting

He hands Paris the bundle Paris curious begins
unwrapping the cloth Finally the object is uncovered a
shining sword expertly forged inscribed with the seal of
Troy
PARIS
The Sword of Troy

PRIAM
My father carried this sword and
his father before him all the way
back to the founding of Troy The
history of our people was written
with this sword
(beat)
Carry it with you tomorrow

Paris holds the sword up and it glows in the moonlight

PRIAM
The spirit of Troy is in that
sword As long as a Trojan carries
it our people have a future

baby boy

Hector looks exhausted He stares at his son

HECTOR
He has no idea whats happening

ANDROMACHE
Thank the gods

HECTOR
The man who killed Tecton outside
Apollos temple -- Ive never seen
a spear thrown like that An
impossible throw

A long beat until Andromache breaks the silence

ANDROMACHE
Briseis was in Apollos temple this
morning

Hector stares at Andromache

HECTOR
Are you sure

She nods swallows hard and closes her eyes After a
moment Hector his eyes full of sorrow runs his hand
through her long hair

HECTOR
I need to see my brother
ANDROMACHE
Dont go
HECTOR

I need to speak with him

ANDROMACHE
I mean tomorrow Dont go Youve
fought enough Let other men go
out there

HECTOR
You think I want to fight my love
I want to see my son grow tall I
want to see the girls chasing after
him

ANDROMACHE
Just like they chased his father 78

HECTOR
Hes much more handsome than I ever
was

For a moment they sit quietly watching their son

ANDROMACHE
I lost seven brothers in the
Spartan Wars Youd think Id be
good at losing by now
(beat)
I cant lose you I wont survive

Hector stares at her for a beat before pulling her close
and kissing her Everything is in this kiss their entire
past Andromache finally lets him go and Hector walks out
the door

INT PALACE HALL - LATER 79
As Hector walks to Pariss room he spies someone in a
dark cloak sneaking down the candle-lit hallway -- an
assassin
HECTOR
Wait

The cloaked figure looks back and then runs Hector
chases The fugitive runs through the archway at the end
of the corridor and into the garden

EXT PALACE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS 80

Hector runs into the garden Hes far faster He seizes
his quarry and pulls aside the fugitives cowl Its
Helen

HECTOR
Helen

By the light of the moon he examines her face The stress
of recent weeks has taken its toll but the shadows
beneath her eyes make her face more compelling than ever

Embarrassed by the awkwardness of their position Hector
stands and helps Helen to her feet

HECTOR
What are you doing out --

80

Helen runs Hector catches her again after a few strides

HELEN
Let me go

HECTOR
Where

Helen struggles against Hectors grip but its useless

HELEN
Let me go

Helen still struggling begins to cry Hector pulls her
to his chest She cries for real now violently sobbing
her mouth muffled against Hectors body

HECTOR
Shh Shh

HELEN
I saw them burn I saw them
burning on the pyres
(beat)
Its my fault

HECTOR
No

HELEN
It is You know it is All those
widows I still hear them
screaming

Helen takes a deep breath She manages to control
herself

HELEN
Their husbands died because Im
here

Hector cant deny this Helen pushes herself out of his
grip

HELEN
Im going down to the ships

HECTOR
No Youre not

80 80
HELEN
Ill give myself back to Menelaus
He can do what he wants -- kill me

make me his slave Anythings
better than this

HECTOR
Its too late for that You think
Agamemnon cares about his brothers
marriage This is about power

Not love
HELEN
Paris is going to fight in the
morning
HECTOR
Yes
HELEN

Menelaus will kill him
Hector looks away the words hurting him

HELEN
I wont let that happen

HECTOR
Its his decision

HELEN
No No I cant ask anyone to
fight for me Im no longer queen
of Sparta

Hector bows to Helen and kisses her hand

HECTOR
Youre a princess of Troy And my
brother needs you tonight

Helen stares at Hector in wonder The words seem to
bolster her spirit and she smiles though her eyes are
still wet She nods touches his arm and goes back to the
palace

81 EXT BEACH ENCAMPMENT - DAWN 81
Up and down the beach thousands of GREEK WARRIORS prepare
for battle Despite their vast numbers the men are oddly

quiet each absorbed with his own thoughts

81

CLOSE ON SEVERAL FACES -- these are men we havent seen
before and probably wont see again not kings or heroes
but ordinary men preparing for battle

One warrior prays with eyes closed mumbling the words
kneeling in the sand A second man inspects each
arrowhead in his quiver A third sits in the sand
snapping seashells

INT ACHILLES TENT - LATER - DAY 82

Achilles sits cross-legged arms held straight out in
front of him palms up His bronze sword is balanced on
his palms

Patroclus and Eudorus armored for battle enter the tent
Achilles does not look away from his blade Though the
sword must be heavy his arms do not tremble

EUDORUS
My lord The army is marching

ACHILLES
Let them march We stay

EUDORUS
But the men --

Achilles turns to glare at him and Eudorus falters

EUDORUS
-- the men are ready

ACHILLES
Agamemnon spat on my honor
yesterday I promised that girl
her safety and he stole her from
me Let him fight the Trojans
today

Eudorus and Patroclus exchange glances Eudorus bows to
Achilles and exits the tent Patroclus remains behind

ACHILLES
When I was very small I saw my
father kill a man with his bare
hands
Patroclus doesnt know how to respond to this

ACHILLES
Theres so much blood in a human
body

Achilles flips the sword in the air and catches it by the
hilt He examines the edge

ACHILLES
Youre ready to fight Patroclus

PATROCLUS
I am

Achilles rests his sword on the ground He stares at
Patroclus for a moment before speaking

ACHILLES
Youre ready to kill

Patroclus hesitates

ACHILLES
At night I see their faces All
the men Ive killed I see them
standing on the far bank of the
River Styx
(beat)
Theyre waiting for me

Patroclus stands absolutely still Hes never heard his
cousin speak this way before

ACHILLES
Some nights I walk among them
When I wake I can still hear their
words
(beat)
They say Welcome brother

Achilles inspects the knuckles of his fist

ACHILLES

Never hate the men you fight All
of us are mortals All of us
wretched things tumbled crying
from our mothers loins

(beat)
Only the gods are free from
sorrows

PATROCLUS
I hate no one cousin 82

ACHILLES
Good
(beat)
I taught you how to fight But I
never taught you why to fight

PATROCLUS
I fight for you
ACHILLES
And who will you follow when Im

gone
Patroclus hesitates unsure how to answer

ACHILLES
Most soldiers battle for kings
theyve never met They do what
theyre told they die when theyre
told to die

PATROCLUS
Soldiers obey

ACHILLES
We dont have much time to walk in
the sun Patroclus After this
life comes the underworld an
eternity telling stories to other
shades Dont tell them you died
following some fools orders

PATROCLUS
And what should I tell them

ACHILLES
Tell them your name If your life
has been worthy theyll know the
rest

EXT WALLS OF TROY - DAY 83

One thousand ARCHERS stand in various positions on the

TROJAN CITIZENS also crowd atop the walls quiet and
sober

Priam sits in a grandstand beneath a blue canopy Seated

horses

The soldiers are disciplined and well-outfitted arranged
in tight formation

Paris rides out to join Hector Hector examines Pariss
face

HECTOR
Are you sure you want to do this

PARIS
I started this war

Paris searches the faces atop the city wall He finds
Helen

CLOSE on Helen The wind is blowing hard ruffling her
cloak her hair There is love in her eyes and fear and
exhaustion Paris stares up at her for a long time before
turning away

A low ominous RUMBLE grows steadily louder Hector hears
it first He looks down the vast sloping field toward the
sea

Now the other soldiers hear it and then the citizens atop
the walls All speech ceases The Trojans quietly wait

The rumbling resolves into the steady beat of WAR DRUMS

EXT BEACH - DUNES 84A

And now we see them fifty thousand GREEKS The
reflection of sunlight off fifty thousand bronze shields
fifty thousand bronze helmets and chest plates is
spectacular -- the army looks like a river of lava
flowing uphill

The Trojan soldiers dont quiver or waver but the
expressions on their faces betray their anxiety The
Greek army is more than twice the size of the Trojan army

Ajax looks around and shrugs

EXT BATTLEFIELD BETWEEN ARMIES 87A

Hector and Paris spur their horses and canter out to meet
the Greeks The brothers speak without looking at each
other

Helen alone views the battlefield An old spotted hand
takes her elbow She turns and looks into Priams eyes

PRIAM
Sit with me

Helen follows the king to his grandstand and sits beside
him Shes aware of people staring at them but he seems
oblivious

PRIAM
All my life Ive prayed against
this day

HELEN
Yes my king

PRIAM

Call me father dear child

Startled by this affection she hesitates before
responding

HELEN
Forgive me father For

She pauses staring out at the vast Greek army

HELEN

Priam shakes his head and smiles sadly

PRIAM
I blame you for nothing
Everything is in the hands of the
gods

Besides how could I blame anyone
for falling in love with Paris

Helen looks out at the battlefield fixing on Paris at
this distance a tiny figure on horseback Priam takes
her hand

EXT BATTLEFIELD - DAY 89

Hector and Paris ride up to the Greek kings Menelaus
stares at Paris his fingers tapping the hilt of his
sword Paris does not make eye contact

The kings step down from their chariots and the Trojan
princes dismount from their horses Both armies are lined
up several hundred yards apart

Agamemnon surveys the Trojan army

AGAMEMNON
I see youre not hiding behind your
high walls Valiant of you I11-
advised but valiant

HECTOR
You come here uninvited Go back
to your ships Go home

AGAMEMNON
Weve come too far Prince Hector

MENELAUS
Prince These are not princes
What son of a king would accept a
mans hospitality eat his food
drink his wine and then steal his
wife in the middle of the night

PARIS
The sun was shining when your wife
left you

Menelaus draws his sword He points it at the city walls
MENELAUS
Shes up there watching isnt she
Good I want her to watch you die

Agamemnon places a hand on his brothers arm

AGAMEMNON
Not yet brother

He makes a sweeping gesture indicating his entire army

AGAMEMNON
Look around you Hector Ive
brought all the warriors of Greece
to your shores

NESTOR
You can still save Troy young
prince
AGAMEMNON

I have two wishes If you grant
them no more of your people need
to die First give Helen back to
my brother Second Troy must
submit to my command to fight for
me whenever I call

HECTOR
You want me to look upon your army
and tremble Well I see them I
see fifty thousand men brought here
to fight for one mans greed

AGAMEMNON
Be careful boy My mercy has
limits

HECTOR

Ive seen the limits of your mercy
And I tell you now that no son of
Troy will ever submit to a foreign
ruler

AGAMEMNON
Then every son of Troy shall die

PARIS
There is another way

Everyone watches Paris now

PARIS
(to Menelaus)
I love Helen I wont give her up
And neither will you So lets
fight our own battle Let the
winner take Helen home and that
will be the end of it

AGAMEMNON
A brave offer But not enough

Menelaus pulls Agamemnon aside and speaks to him out of
the others earshot

MENELAUS
Let me kill this little peacock 89

AGAMEMNON
I didnt come here for your pretty
wife I came for Troy

MENELAUS
And I came for my honor His every
breath insults me

(beat)

Let me kill him When hes lying
in the dust give the signal to
attack Ill have my revenge and
youll have your city

Agamemnon ponders the offer He nods They rejoin the
others

MENELAUS
(to Paris)
I accept your challenge And
tonight Ill drink to your bones

He walks over to his chariot and grabs his shield Hector
helps Paris into his helmet and speaks quietly to him

HECTOR
He doesnt have the stamina he once
did Make him swing and miss
Hell tire

Paris nods He turns toward Menelaus but quickly turns
back and grabs Hectors arm

PARIS
Hector

Hector waits Paris opens his mouth but no words come
out He tries again

PARIS
If I fall -- tell Helen -- tell
her --

HECTOR
I will

PARIS

Dont let Menelaus hurt her Make
him swear --

HECTOR
Think about your sword and his
sword Nothing else

Hector hugs him close for a moment and releases him
Paris walks toward the center of the field where Menelaus
waits

PARISS POV 89A

Its difficult to see from inside your bronze helmet
Your peripheral vision is severely restricted and the
nose guard bisects your vision

Your breathing sounds amplified impossibly loud and half-
panicked But theres no turning back Menelaus stands
in the center of the vast battlefield patient and
menacing carving the air with lazy strokes of his sword

You look back and see Hector Hector nods trying to
encourage you but he looks worried Behind Hector is the
Trojan army twenty-five thousand silent men

Behind the army is the city of Troy Atop those walls
beneath that blue canopy your father is watching and the
woman you love

You turn back to Menelaus Hes smiling at you

BACK TO SCENE 89B

Menelaus charges at Paris and swings mightily trying to
knock the princes head from his shoulders Paris manages
to duck beneath the flashing blade

Menelaus fights with little art and great savagery
exploiting his superior strength Paris is quicker He
nearly surprises the bigger man with a fast sword thrust
but Menelaus dominates the fight hammering Pariss shield
with a furious barrage of blows

Paris steps away and tries another thrust but this time
Menelaus sidesteps and smashes Paris in the jaw with the
hilt of his sword knocking the princes helmet off

Paris falls blood leaking from his nose and mouth

Hector frustrated and powerless to help tries to will
his brother to victory

Ajax standing nearby sees Hector chopping his way
through the Greeks Ajax runs at Hector

Two TROJAN SOLDIERS try to intercept Ajax The mighty
Greek swings his huge battle axe The blade cuts clean
through the first soldiers arm and halfway through his
torso

The second soldier hacks at Ajax but the big man blocks
the sword with his shield and then uses the shield to ram
the soldiers face Blood sprays from the Trojans
crushed skull Both soldiers fall dead to the ground

Hector battling a Greek INFANTRYMAN doesnt see Ajax
coming Ajax grabs Hectors horses bridle and tugs hard
the veins in his arms bulging beneath the skin

The horse tries to buck but Ajax twists the horses head
till it falls Hector falls with the horse tumbling to
the dirt The Greek infantryman he had been fighting
stabs at him

Hector rolls away and manages -- while flat on his back
-- to swing his sword chopping off the infantrymans feet
just above the ankles The infantryman screams and falls

Ajax releases the horse raises his axe and swings at the
fallen Hector The prince gets his shield up just in
time Ajaxs axe cleaves through the shield splitting
the bronze into two even halves

Hector stares at the halved shield discards it and jumps
to his feet The two fighters circle each other while
thousands of soldiers around them battle to the death

So youre the best of the Trojans

Hector looking for an opening in the brutes defenses
says nothing Ajax charges swinging his battle axe

Hector ducks below the axe and lunges forward with his
sword but Ajax -- quick despite his size -- sidesteps
grabs the smaller man in a bear hug and squeezes

Hector turns red The sword falls from Hectors hand
Ajax grins

Hector slams his helmeted head forward butting Ajax in
the face Ajax staggers back blood spraying from his
nose his axe falling to the ground

Hector struggles to regain his equilibrium Ajax growls
and launches himself at the prince

Hector snatches a spear off the ground and positions it
just as Ajax dives at him The spear pierces Ajaxs
armor driving through his belly and out his back Hector
holds the shaft steady Ajax stares down at his wound

He seems more irritated than anything else

Ajax places his two big hands on the spear shaft right
where the spear enters his body He breaks the spear in
two snapping the solid wood like a twig

Half a spear still sticking out his back Ajax swings the
shaft clobbering Hector in the side of the head sending
the horsehair-plumed helmet flying 98

Hector dazed falls to one knee Ajax whacks him again
on the back of his neck Hector crawls forward blindly
His hands brush over the blade of his dropped sword

Hector springs up driving his sword into Ajaxs gut just
below the big mans breast plate Hector withdraws his
sword Both men see the ground drenched with Ajaxs
blood

Ajax backhands Hector with the broken spear shaft
cracking the prince in the jaw and dropping him again
Ajax grabs Hector hoists him upright and begins
throttling the prince Ajax spits a great wad of blood
and smiles teeth washed red

Hector tries to kick at Ajax but Ajaxs thumbs dig deeper
and deeper into Hectors throat Hectors eyelids begin
to flutter as he chokes

But the Salamisian king has lost too much blood He sinks
slowly to his knees Hector is forced to his knees as
well

Finally Ajaxs eyes roll back He topples onto Hector
hands still locked on the princes throat Hector undoes
the death grip He squirms out from under Ajaxs corpse
and stands

she bounces into tears off a strip of her robes which are
now filthy rags barely covering her body

Her face seems to have shut down She has a bruise below
one eye and her hair is wet with wine The soldiers stare
at her with a mix of hostility and lust

from breeding any more Trojan
bastards

Haemon squats by the fire holding an iron in the flames
He pulls out a branding iron in the shape of Agamemnons
seal a white-hot ALPHA He carries it toward Briseis

Hold her down

Briseis sees the hot iron and begins to struggle
screaming and kicking at the men Four of the soldiers
pin her down

Why are you kicking girl Better
to be a Spartan slave than a Trojan
priestess

Briseis claws Haemon in the face He growls and punches
her

Come on come on hold her down

The soldiers hold her in the sand Haemon steadies the
hot brand and searches for the best place to mark her

When the brand is inches from her arm someone grabs the
iron pulls it out of Haemons hands and then slams it
down on the mans head Haemon collapses

By firelight he looks ferocious Echepolus stumbles
backward

respected

For a long beat they are silent staring at each other
The air between them is charged with more than mere
contention

What do you want here in Troy You
didnt come for the Spartan queen

ACHILLES
I want what all men want I just
want it more

Achilles takes an apple and unsheathes a dagger He
tosses the apple in his hand On the third toss he whips
his knife-hand up and across and neatly catches four apple
quarters

He offers a quarter to Briseis Stunned she slowly
shakes her head Achilles shrugs and eats the sliced
apple 110

Ill tell you a secret-- something
they didnt teach you in your
temple The gods envy us They
envy us because were mortal
because every moment might be our
last Everything is more beautiful
for the doomed

You will never be lovelier than you
are right now And we will never
be here again

grapes on the platter beside her

Finally she puts it down

May Apollo forgive me

Achilles pulls her closer and they kiss

He slowly slides the robe off her shoulders Briseis --
eyes closed lips parted -- trembles as Achilles unveils
her For a moment she hesitates but soon hesitation

Rosy-fingered dawn appears The seagulls cry above the
waves

INT ACHILLES TENT - MORNING 114
Achilles watches Briseis sleep She looks very young and
fragile her face bruised her eyelids fluttering as she
dreams Achilles watches her with great tenderness

Eudorus opens the tent flap Sunlight streams in

Achilles puts a finger over his mouth Eudorus sees

Briseis and nods Achilles gently pulls the blanket over
her naked shoulders He stands and exits

EXT ACHILLES TENT - CONTINUOUS 115

Odysseus waits for Achilles outside the tent

115 115

ACHILLES
(to Eudorus)
Have the men start loading the
ship Were going home

Eudorus surprised looks at Odysseus for a second before
bowing to his commander and walking away

ODYSSEUS
You found the girl

ACHILLES
I found her

ODYSSEUS
Is she hurt

ACHILLES

Not as badly as those who hurt her

Achilles stares at the sea Seagulls patrol the skies

ACHILLES

Do you miss your wife Odysseus
ODYSSEUS

Always
ACHILLES

Ive never missed anyone in my
life I used to think it was a
weakness needing someone else

ODYSSEUS
We all need someone else Right
now Greece needs you

ACHILLES
Greece got along fine before I was
born and Greece will be Greece long
after Im dead

ODYSSEUS
Im not talking about the land
The valleys the mountains -- they

dont care what we do The men
need you You should have seen the
slaughter yesterday

ACHILLES
I saw it And I saw who led the
men to slaughter 115

ODYSSEUS
Agamemnon is a proud man But
he knows when hes made a mistake

ACHILLES
The man sends you to make his
apologies He doesnt understand
honor What are you doing in
thrall to that pig of a king

ODYSSEUS
The world seems simple to you my
friend But when youre a king
very few choices are simple
Ithaca cannot afford an enemy like
Agamemnon

ACHILLES
Am I supposed to fear him

ODYSSEUS
You dont fear anyone thats your
problem Fear is useful

(beat)
Stay Achilles You were born for
this war
ACHILLES
My life is war Is that what you
think
ODYSSEUS

Am I wrong

Achilles stares at the sea again

ACHILLES
A week ago you were right But
things are less simple today

ODYSSEUS
Women have a way of complicating
things

Achilles smiles He turns to Odysseus and clasps his

hand

ACHILLES
Of all the kings of Greece I
respect you most But in this war
youre a servant And I refuse to
be a servant any longer

115 115

ODYSSEUS
Sometimes you need to serve in
order to lead I hope you
understand that one day

Odysseus walks away Achilles watches him go and then
turns back toward his tent He sees that Patroclus has
been standing by the tent throughout the previous
conversation

PATROCLUS
Were going home

ACHILLES
We leave at noon

He tries to enter his tent but Patroclus grabs his arm and
blocks his path Achilles stares at Patroclus hand
Patroclus releases him but doesnt move out of the way

PATROCLUS
If Poseidon curses us and our ship
goes down what will I tell the
shades in Hades That 1 died
running from this war abandoning
our countrymen

ACHILLES
Our countrymen

PATROCLUS

Yes our country Were Greek
cousin I broke bread with these
men I drank their wine I listened
to their jokes These are our
comrades We cannot desert them

(beat)
Your feud with Agamemnon is tearing
this army apart And your
reputation suffers The men are
talking --

Achilles eyes narrow as his temper rises

ACHILLES
If my blood wasnt in your
veins --

PATROCLUS

But your blood is in my veins 115
ACHILLES

I gave you an order cousin We
leave at noon

Achilles opens the tent flap

PATROCLUS
If you command us not to fight for
the king of kings so be it But
please dont ask me not to fight
for Greece
(long beat)

When the shades hear my name I want
them to know I led a worthy life

Achilles face inscrutable watches his cousin walk away
INT PRIAMS MEETING HALL - MORNING 116
The notables weve seen in this room before -- Priam
Hector Glaucus Velior Archeptolemus -- are gathered
again

ARCHEPTOLEMUS
The omens are gathering The
directive is clear

HECTOR
Fight for your country Thats the
only directive

PRIAM

(to Hector)
The last time the high priest spoke
to us he prophesied a great victory
for Troy We won a great victory
Let him speak

(to Archeptolemus)
What course of action do you
recommend

ARCHEPTOLEMUS
The gods favor our cause Now is
the time to destroy the Greek army

PRIAM
Glaucus

116 116

GLAUCUS
Their morale is battered Hit them
now hit them hard and they will
run

VELIOR
I must admit I overestimated the
Greeks They lack discipline and
courage

Hector frustrated and weary rubs his eyes

HECTOR

The Myrmidons did not fight
yesterday There must be
dissension among the Greeks But
if we attack their ships well
unify them

(beat)
If they decide to attack let them
They cant breach our walls Well
beat them back again

(beat to Priam)
Yesterday the Greeks underestimated
us We should not return the favor
today

Priam meditates on this conflicting advice He stands and
paces about the room He turns to Archeptolemus

PRIAM
Youre confident about the meaning
of these omens

ARCHEPTOLEMUS
The desecration of his temple
angers Apollo The gods have
cursed the Greeks Two of their
kings have already gone down to the
dust

Priam continues pacing hands clasped behind his back

PRIAM
Prepare the army We attack at
noon

HECTOR

Were making a mistake father
Father and son face each other across the long table

PRIAM
Prepare the army

INT ACHILLES WARSHIP - DAY 118
Briseis sits in the cabin watching Achilles tie a hammock

to a peg Something has changed between them She looks
at him with undisguised tenderness

BRISEIS
Am I still your captive

ACHILLES
Captive is a harsh word Youre my
guest

BRISEIS
In Troy guests can leave whenever
they want

ACHILLES

Strange custom

Achilles takes her hand and inspects her uncalloused
palms

ACHILLES
Youve never worked the fields
Never chopped wood never carried a
milk pail These are the hands of
royalty

Achilles raises his own hands and shows them to her

ACHILLES
My hands are gates to the
underworld
(beat)

All my life Ive walked with Death

But I grow tired of his company
(beat)

Come with me to Larissa

A hint of a smile crosses her lips

BRISEIS
Larissa Is that where youre
from

Its a pretty name

ACHILLES
I thought Id never see it again

Before I left home my mother told
me my fate

BRISEIS

She speaks with the gods

ACHILLES

She knows things

(beat)
She told me if I stayed home Id
have a long peaceful life And if
I came to Troy life would be
short but my name would never be
forgotten

BRISEIS
And you chose Troy

ACHILLES
But what if Fate brought me here
for another purpose What if I had
to go to war to find peace
(beat)
To find you

She cups his face between her palms pulls him closer
kisses his lips For a moment they gaze at each other
until the sounds of WAR CRIES HORNS and BATTLE DRUMS
fill the air

Achilles raises his head and listens his face hardening
Briseis alarmed watches him

EXT AGAMEMNONS TENT - DAY 119

Agamemnon Nestor and Odysseus exit the tent The beach
is a frenzy of activity Thousands of men rush to their
positions hastily arming themselves The kings look to
the high dunes

EXT HIGH DUNES - CONTINUOUS 120

EXT BEACH ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS 121
The GREEKS plainly nervous swarm to the long trench

theyve dug The Trojans crushed them yesterday Now
theyre back

EXT HIGH DUNES 121A
The Trojan ARCHERS pull their bows off their shoulders and
notch their arrows

EXT BEACH ENCAMPMENT 121B

The Greek archers notch their arrows

Odysseus stands with his ITHACANS waiting to battle A
cry starts up on the far end of the Greek line and grows
steadily louder Odysseus looks in that direction

A glittering figure has stepped forth from the Myrmidon
camp clad in the beautiful and distinctive armor that
every man in the Greek army recognizes

ODYSSEUS
Achilles

All down the Greek line we hear the cheer building to a
roar Agamemnon hearing the commotion turns and sees
the shining warrior He watches the spectacle with mixed
emotions

Eudorus standing with several Myrmidons is thrilled by
his leaders unexpected arrival

EUDORUS
Arm yourselves men

The Myrmidons quickly and excitedly arm themselves

EXT HIGH DUNES 1210

The Trojans are not aware of this energy Hector raises
his sword and points at the Greeks The Trojan army
charges When they are within range the Trojan archers
release sending a volley of arrows over the heads of
their comrades The Greek archers release at the same
time

Two flocks of arrows cross in the sky and swoop down on
the men below Dozens of Greeks and Trojans fall to the
sand
121D

EXT GREEK BEACH DEFENSES 121D

But now the glorious bronzed figure of Achilles leaps over
the trench sunlight reflecting off his polished armor

He raises his sword to the sky A great violent ROAR
rises from the Greek army When he runs toward the
Trojans the Greeks jump from their positions and follow

The two armies collide Unlike the grassy field the men
fought on yesterday todays battle takes place on the
sand and sand is everywhere

Horse hooves kick up clouds of sand Men struggle for
footing in the loose sand Red blood puddles on the
yellow sand

But much more is different than the terrain Now the
Greeks have a leader The Myrmidons are at the forefront
battling with a ferocity most Trojans have never seen
before

A Trojan OFFICER spear raised gallops toward the figure
of Achilles Before the Trojan can throw Eudorus hurls
his spear catching the officer in the neck The man goes
down

Odysseus immersed in combat sees this He hesitates for
a moment and in his distraction is nearly cut down by an
axe-wielding Trojan They fight

After Odysseus dispatches the man he looks back toward
the glittering figure of Achilles Somethings making him
uneasy

A Trojan swings his sword at the shining warrior narrowly
missing a clean decapitation The Greek hero thrusts his
spear and guts the Trojan

The Myrmidons surge forward hacking their way through the
Trojans The Greek army steadily pushes the Trojans back
picking up more and more momentum

Now it is the Trojans who seem frightened unsure where
the Greeks found this intense spirit

Glaucus the Trojan general on horseback shouts to
Hector

GLAUCUS
The gods are with them today We
should fall back
Hector fighting does not answer

121D

121D

The Myrmidons are getting closer to the elite Apollonians
Hector notices them now He notices the beautiful armor
of their leader notices the leader hop nimbly from the
path of a charging Trojan and cut the man down

HECTOR
(to himself)
Achilles

Hector goes after him He grips the reins and guides his
horse toward the Myrmidons His Apollonians clustered
about him protectively move in that direction as well

EXT GREEK BEACH DEFENSES 1215

The two elite forces clash These men are experts
wielding their spears and swords with superior skill

Hectors horse stumbles in the deep sand Hector abandons
his mount leaping down to the beach running for the
shining warrior A Myrmidon intercepts him Their battle
is quick-- Hector kills him with a sword thrust

Now he is face to face (or helmet to helmet) with the
figure of glorious Achilles The two men breathing
heavily from the combat stand still for a moment

The intricately-worked bronze of Achilles helmet
breastplate and shield all shine bright Hes a
difficult man to stare at for long Now he charges sword
raised

They fight And though the battle continues all around
them everyone seems to be aware of the duel taking place

The shining warrior is quicker than Hector and lighter on
his feet swinging again and again a blaze of bronze
Hector fights patiently parrying the blows waiting for
an opening

The sword of Achilles whistles over Hectors head swung
so hard that the man wielding it cannot protect himself
Hector takes full advantage swinging quickly his blade
carving the soft flesh just beneath Achilles helmet

A long question mark of blood whips out of the cut throat
The man falls

1215

Everything seems to stop Though the battle is still
underway and thousands of individuals are still fighting
for their lives a collective gasp of despair comes from
the Greeks

Odysseus stunned stares at the body on the ground
Hector stands next to the fallen man He wedges the tip
of his sword inside the bronze helmet and lifts it off

Patroclus is dying trying to breathe as his throat floods
with blood His eyes are panicked

Hector stares down at the dying boy at the blood-soaked
SEASHELL NECKLACE

For a moment they stare at each other the victorious
prince of Troy and the dying boy in the sand The sounds
of Patroclus gurgling breaths visibly upset the prince

With an anguished cry he raises his sword and brings it
down We dont see the blade hit but the boys suffering
ends

Hector sees a stunned Odysseus standing nearby The
Greeks have pushed the Trojans back from the beach onto
the grassy inland plains but now combat has halted

HECTOR
Enough for one day

Odysseus nods Hector calls out to Glaucus

HECTOR
Arms down Back to the city

Glaucus relays the call Odysseus calls to his CAPTAINS

ODYSSEUS
Arms down Arms down To the
beach

Odysseus sheathes his sword and approaches He crouches
by Patroclus and closes the dead boys frightened eyes
Hector and Odysseus look at each other for a beat

Hector mounts his horse and leads his men home The two
sides retreat Eudorus hurries over and kneels beside the
dead boy

EUDORUS
We were going to sail home at noon 1215
ODYSSEUS
I dont think anyones sailing home
now
EXT ACHILLES WARSHIP - LATER 122

Eudorus walks up to the ship takes a few deep breaths
and calls to his commander

EUDORUS
Achilles

Achilles emerges from the ships cabin and walks to the
bow He descends the gangplank to the beach Briseis
follows

Eudorus bows Achilles examines his captain Hudorus is
sweaty and dirty his hands caked with dried blood His
helmet is off but he still wears his armor

ACHILLES
Youve been fighting

EUDORUS
My lord --

ACHILLES

You violated my command

EUDORUS
No my lord There was a mistake

ACHILLES
A mistake I ordered the Myrmidons
to stand down You led them into
combat

EUDORUS
I didnt lead them

Eudorus cannot meet his commanders gaze

ACHILLES
Who did

EUDORUS
We thought you did

Now Achilles can tell staring at his captains face that
something is very wrong He looks around the encampment
All the men returning from combat avoid looking at
Achilles

122

Wheres Patroclus

EUDORUS
We thought it was you my lord We
-- he wore your armor Your
shield your grieves your helmet

like you He even moved like you
We all followed --

great courage But Hector came
after him

Achilles nostrils are flared his eyes narrowed

EUDORUS
If I could have saved him --

Achilles hits Eudorus hard in the mouth The captain
falls to the sand Achilles looms above him fists
clenched Eudorus holds his mouth Blood is already
beginning to stream out

ACHILLES
Liar

EUDORUS
My lord I saw him fall

Achilles seizes Eudorus by the hair and hauls him to his
knees He snatches Eudoruss sword and raises it
Briseis grabs Achilles shoulder

BRISEIS
Dont
With his free hand Achilles grabs her throat She claws
at his wrist Her feet spasm and kick inches off the
ground 122

Eyes bulging she stares at him Whatever kindness shed
seen in his eyes before whatever tenderness its gone
now

Achilles drops her She sags to the ground gasping for
breath beginning to sob Achilles releases Eudorus The
captain remains on his knees watching his lord

ACHILLES
Dead

EUDORUS
Hector cut his throat

Achilles walks to a dead campfire where the Myrmidons cook
their dinner He drops Eudoruss sword and kneels in the
ashes grabs handfuls of the soot and blackens his face

Achilles stands grabs the sword and walks toward the
sea Everyone stares at him He keeps walking as the
waters lap at his ankles his knees his waist

The waves are high crashing down on him but Achilles
does not turn from them He swings the sword chopping
through the surf slicing the crests off the waves
groaning as he fights The soldiers on the beach stare at
him

Achilles battles the sea

of horsehair

Scamandrius begins to CRY Hector removes his helmet

Now the boy sees his father He giggles and reaches out
Hector takes the boy in his arms and holds him He kisses
the boys fuzzed head and closes his eyes for a moment

The people on the walls are hushed Even the birds seem
reverent

Thousands and thousands of Greeks now line the high dunes
making the valley an enormous amphitheater ringed with
spectators from the dunes to the walls of Troy

Achilles stands motionless The two men are alone on the
great field Hector stops twenty feet away from Achilles

HECTOR
Ive seen this moment in my dreams

Achilles expressionless stares at the prince

HECTOR
Ill make a pact with you with the
gods as our witnesses Let us
pledge that the winner will allow
the loser all the proper funeral

rituals
ACHILLES
There are no pacts between lions
and men
Achilles tosses aside his helmet -- an insulting gesture

impugning Hectors combat skills

ACHILLES
Now you know who youre fighting

Hector pauses a moment before removing his own helmet and
tossing it aside

HECTOR
I thought it was you I was fighting
yesterday I wish it had been you
But I gave the dead boy the honor he --

You gave him the honor of your
sword

You wont have eyes tonight You
wont have ears or a tongue
Youll wander the underworld
blind deaf and dumb And all the
dead will know this is Hector the
fool who thought he killed
Achilles

Achilles draws his sword Hector draws his They charge

Weve seen extraordinary fighting before but weve never
seen this -- a prowess so extreme as to be hypnotic Two
better swordsmen have never clashed All their lives all
their training and past battles have led to this moment

Nothing is wasted No flourishes or balletic leaps or
spins Every swing is a death blow countered The
rapidity of the exchange is breathless

The bronze blades hiss as they split the air They swing
with such power that sparks fly whenever a sword scrapes a
shield

has skewered Achilles Hectors face is inches from Achilles
Achilles appears unperturbed Hector looks down

Achilles has trapped him allowing Hectors sword to miss
his side by inches and then clamping down on Hectors
sword arm Hector tries to yank his sword free but
cannot

Achilles stabs at Hectors face and Hector ducks at the
last moment the sword point puncturing the air above his
head Achilles releases Hector and takes another mighty
swing

close

Hector sees an opening and slashes Achilles jumps back
at the last possible moment but Hectors blade gouges out
a long strip of bronze from Achilles breastplate

Both men swing Their swords lock and for a moment
everything is still Achilles face is inches from
Hectors Hector is sweating and breathing heavily
Achilles is not

Achilles shoves Hector and relaunches his attack While
Hector still fights ably hes clearly tiring As
Achilles blows force Hector back the prince steps on a
rock trips and falls Achilles stands above him

ACHILLES
Get up prince of Troy I wont
let a stone take my glory

Hector stands He knows his energy is fading fast So he
spends everything on one last try He charges swinging
with explosive fury putting all his might into each blow

When the barrage is finished and Hector pauses for a
breath he sees that Achilles unhurt has parried
everything Now Achilles bores in swinging Hector
blocks and blocks but doesnt have the stamina for a new
assault

Achilles lunges Hector raises his shield The sword
plunges through the seven layers of oxhide plunges
through the hammered bronze of the shield the bronze of
the breastplate all the way into Hectors heart

Hector looks down at the blade He looks at Achilles
There is no mercy or remorse on the mans face

Hector falls

EXT WALLS OF TROY - CONTINUOUS 146

Priam reacts as if he received the blow clutching at his
chest and reeling backward

146

Paris presses forward gripping the edge of the wall so
hard his knuckles turn white

Andromache hears the GROANS of the crowd She covers her
ears and clamps her eyes shut Scamandrius stares at her
baffled

EXT BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS 147

Hector lies on his back Achilles pulls out his bloody
sword and walks to his chariot Hector blinks The sun
now high in the sky is blinding Hector stares into the
sun and dies

Silence Silence everywhere No victory cry from the
Greeks

Achilles returns in the chariot He jumps out with the
coil of rope He ties Hectors ankles together then ties
the other end of the rope to the back of the chariot

EXT WALLS OF TROY - CONTINUOUS 148

Something hardens in Pariss face Whatever callowness
weve seen before seems to ebb away as he watches Achilles
abuse Hectors body Priam and his subjects watch in
horror

PRIAM
My boy my boy

Andromache sits against the wall knees tucked against her
chest face against her knees Scamandrius begins to cry
Helen kneels by Andromache She picks up the baby and
soothes him Helen takes Andromaches hand Andromache
looks up Her eyes are a terrible thing to see

HELEN
Lets go inside

Andromache allows Helen to pull her to her feet Helen
holding the baby in one arm guides Andromache away
EXT BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS 149

Achilles whips his horse and the chariot starts rolling
dragging Hector through the grass

EXT WALLS OF TROY - CONTINUOUS 150

Priams legs give out Glaucus and Paris catch him before
he falls and carry him toward the shade beneath the blue
canopy

EXT HIGH DUNES - DAY 151

Achilles rides his chariot over the crest of the dune
The Greek army parts like the Red Sea solemn and silent

EXT BEACH ENCAMPMENT - DAY 152

Achilles rides into camp The Greek soldiers gather round
to stare at Hectors body Achilles doesnt look at
anyone He unties the rope and hauls Hector by hand
across the sands

Odysseus stands nearby amongst the men A few of the
soldiers laugh seeing the Trojan prince laid low

SOLDIER 1
He doesnt look so glorious now

Odysseus turns and glares at the soldier who shuts his
mouth Odysseus walks away

Achilles drags Hectors body to his tent dumps him there
and walks inside

INT ACHILLES TENT - CONTINUOUS 153

Briseis kneels in the center of the tent palms pressed
together eyes lowered in prayer She opens her eyes and
looks up when Achilles walks in

He looks more beast than man splattered with Hectors
blood Briseis sees Achilles face and knows what
happened For the first time her strength deserts her
She looks very young very childlike as she begins to cry

He regards her for a moment before going to his bedding
and lying on his back We stay on his face as Briseis
weeps

EXT BEACH ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT 154

All but the sentries are sleeping No campfires burn as a
fat moon rises above the sea

INT ACHILLES TENT - NIGHT 155

Achilles now clean sits in the center of the tent
sharpening his sword Briseis sits in a far corner
Shes been crying for hours her eyes red and swollen

BRISEIS
You lost your cousin And now
youve taken mine

Achilles looks up at her

BRISEIS
When does it end

Achilles continues sharpening his sword

ACHILLES
It never ends

Briseis stares at him for a moment and leaves the tent
Achilles quits his sharpening Now there is nothing but
silence nothing but a bronze sword for company

EXT TROJAN BEACH - NIGHT 156

Briseis sits on the beach facing the moonlit sea

INT ACHILLES TENT - NIGHT 157

Achilles still sits alone his eyes empty He hears a
rustling at the tent flap An old man wearing a hooded
robe steps inside The old man pulls his hood down Its
Priam

ACHILLES
Who are you

Priam seems physically hurt by the sight of Achilles For
a moment it seems he will collapse again

But he wills himself onward walking to Achilles chair
He sinks to his knees takes Achilles hands and kisses
them Achilles observes all this with curiosity

PRIAM
I have endured what no one on earth
has endured before I kissed the
hands of the man who killed my son

ACHILLES
Priam

157 157

Priam nods Achilles stands helping the old man to his
feet

ACHILLES
How did you get in here old king
The sentries --

PRIAM
I know my own country better than
the Greeks I think

ACHILLES
Youre a brave man If Agamemnon
knew you were here hed have your
head on a spit

PRIAM
Do you really think death frightens
me now I watched my eldest son
die watched you drag his body
behind your chariot

Priam stares at Achilles and for the first time since
weve known him Achilles looks away

PRIAM
Give him back to me He deserves
the honor of a proper burial You
know that Give him to me

ACHILLES
He killed my cousin

PRIAM

He thought it was you He defended
his country How many cousins have
you killed How many sons and
fathers and brothers and husbands
How many brave Achilles

(beat)
I knew your father He died before
his time But he was lucky not to
live long enough to see his son
fall

Achilles does not respond We cannot read his expression 157

PRIAM

Youve taken everything from me
My eldest son heir to my throne
defender of my kingdom

(beat)
I cant change what happened Its
the will of the gods But give me
this small mercy

Achilles looks into the old mans eyes Priam tries to
blink back his tears but fails

PRIAM

I loved my boy from the moment he
opened his eyes till the moment you
closed them

(beat)
Let me wash his body Let me say
the prayers Let me place two
coins on his eyes for the boatman

ACHILLES
If I let you walk out of here if I
let you take him it doesnt change
anything Youre still my enemy in
the morning

PRIAM
Youre still my enemy tonight But
even enemies can show respect

Achilles nods

ACHILLES
I admire your courage old man
Youre a better king than the one
leading this army Meet me outside
in a moment

EXT ACHILLES TENT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 158

Achilles carrying a torch and a white shroud walks to
the spot where Hectors body lies He crouches beside the
dead prince Death has not robbed Hectors face of its
dignity

A small sand crab approaches the body and Achilles shoos
it away He shoves the butt end of the torch into the
sand

158

Achilles rubs his eyes with his hand and takes several
deep breaths When he removes his hand we see something
remarkable Achilles eyes are wet with tears

For a moment he seems unsure what to do Finally he
begins wrapping the white sheet around Hectors body

ACHILLES
Well meet again soon

INT ACHILLES TENT - LATER - NIGHT 159

Priam deep in his grief sits with his head bowed He
hears noiases outside He stands and exits the tent

EXT BEACH ENCAMPMENT - CONTINUOUS 160

Achilles gently loads Hectors body now wrapped in the
shroud onto a moonlit chariot Priam walks to the
chariot

Four Myrmidons keeping a respectful distance stand
guard

ACHILLES
Your son was the best Ive fought
I want you to know that
(beat)
In my country the funeral games
last twelve days

PRIAM
Its the same in my country

ACHILLES
Then no Greek will attack Troy for
twelve days The prince deserves
that honor

Achilles hearing footsteps turns Briseis emerges from
the shadows Priam is stunned

PRIAM
Briseis

Priam wraps his arms around her thrilled shes alive
PRIAM
We thought you were dead little

swan

160

After a moment Briseis turns and looks at Achilles
Nobody speaks for a long beat Tears shine in Briseis
eyes

ACHILLES
Youll be safe behind the Trojan
walls

Achilles reaches into his tunic and pulls out the SHELL
NECKLACE that Patroclus had worn He fastens it around
her delicate neck where the purple bruises are still
visible He speaks quietly to her too softly for Priam
to hear

ACHILLES
If I hurt you -- its not what I
wanted
(long beat)

You gave me one night of peace in a
lifetime of war

She stares up at him her young face mapped with
conflicting emotions Finally Achilles turns to Priam

ACHILLES
Go No one will stop you you have
my word

Priam gets in the chariot Briseis still looks at
Achilles

PRIAM
Come my girl

Priam reaches down and helps her onto the chariot He
seizes the reins and theyre off the Myrmidons escorting
them to safety Achilles stares at Briseis until shes
gone

the words)

white and gold his hair washed and oiled his skin
gleaming and clean His face is undamaged Two coins
rest above his eyes

His hand trembles He is unable to light the pyre

to make the sheep invite the wolves

ODYSSEUS

ACHILLES
Agamemnon will kill them all Men
women children -- all of them

You know that

ODYSSEUS

165

ODYSSEUS

of the tower and squints into the morning fog Sentry 2
looks at him and then joins him

soldiers -- still wary of an ambush -- surround their
leaders protecting them from attack The Trojan leaders
dismount

Slowly they approach a WOODEN HORSE standing forty feet
high

168

The beach is deserted save for the bones of burnt-out
ships a few stray arrows the remnants of the camp fires
and corpses -- dozens of Greek bodies scattered in the
sands

Each of the cadavers is covered with large black sores
The Trojans inspect the bodies keeping a wary distance

PRIAM
Plague

GLAUCUS
Dont get too close my king

ARCHEPTOLEMUS
This is the will of the gods

Everyone turns to look at the high priest

ARCHEPTOLEMUS
They desecrated the temple of Apollo and Apollo desecrated
their flesh The Greeks could fight our swords and
arrows but they cant fight the gods plague
Glaucus shakes his head and laughs

GLAUCUS
They thought theyd come here and
sack our city in a day And look
at them now fleeing across the
Aegean

Priam stares up at the great horse

PRIAM
What is this

ARCHEPTOLEMUS
An offering to Poseidon The
Greeks are praying for a safe
return home

GLAUCUS
I hope the Sea God spits on their
offering and lets them all drown at
the bottom of the sea

ARCHEPTOLEMUS
This is a gift We should bring it
to the temple of Poseidon
All the men stare at the towering horse 168
PARIS
I think we should burn it
VELIOR
Burn it My prince -- its a gift
to the gods
GLAUCUS

The prince is right Id burn all
of Greece if I had a big enough
torch

what you insult Our beloved
prince Hector had sharp words for
the gods and a day later Achilles
sword cut him down

Priam turns to look at the high priest

PARIS
(glaring at
Archeptolemus)
Burn it father

Archeptolemus ignores Paris and speaks directly to Priam

ARCHEPTOLEMUS

the gods wrath

street

EXT BEACH ENCAMPMENT - DUSK 172

Soldiers emerge from the horse and slide silently down the
ropes Achilles Odysseus and ten other Greek soldiers
None of them wear the bright clanking bronze armor

Their swords and spears are wrapped in lambskins

Odysseus leads a team of Ithacans across the square
Quiet as shadows they creep up on the sentries guarding

smile crosses his face He has waited for this moment his
entire life He marches toward his destiny

Paris notches another arrow His hands are shaking but he
fires again This one drills deep into Achilles belly

BRISEIS
Stop

Achilles keeps coming Paris reaches for another arrow
His quiver is empty Aeneas has his sword

The palace around them is burning lighting their faces
Blood pours from Achilles wounds The arrow shafts stick
out of him Any other man would have already fallen But
he keeps coming relentless his face a mask of grim
purpose

Briseis runs in front of her cousin Paris and shields him
with her body Achilles lifts his bloody sword

BRISEIS
No more

Briseis does not move For several seconds the great
warrior and the young girl stare at each other

BRISEIS
No more killing

Achilles looks at the seashell necklace she wears

BRISEIS
No more

Achilles raises his sword and brings it down hard burying
its bronze blade in the soil of the garden

ACHILLES
No more

He reaches out and rubs the shells of her necklace

ACHILLES
My mother made this necklace

200 200

He sinks to a sitting position on the grass He pulls the
arrows out of his body and tosses them aside Briseis
sits beside him She cradles his head in her arms while
all Troy burns around them

ACHILLES
You have to get out

BRISEIS
Shh

ACHILLES
Get out

She kisses his lips running her fingers across his jaw

BRISEIS
Theres no way out

Achilles stares at Paris

ACHILLES
Theres always a way out for the
princes

Paris tries to lift Briseis to her feet but she refuses

ACHILLES
Briseis

She leans closer Hes losing too much blood his
strength is fading but he summons his remaining energy to
speak

ACHILLES
I chose this night but you will
see the sun again I want you to
live

Her face is full of sorrow and love He touches her lips
his fingers trembling as his body fails She kisses him

ACHILLES
Live

She doesnt want to go but he pushes her gently away
Finally she nods

BRISEIS
Because of you

200 200

She turns and follows Paris down the stairs toward escape
Achilles watches her intently until he sees shes safely
away He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes

Hordes of rampaging Greeks storm the garden burning
anything that will burn hollering their victory cries

Achilles sits alone in the garden He shivers hugging
himself for warmth waiting

EXT MAIN SQUARE OF TROY - DAWN 201

The Greeks are victorious The beautiful city of Troy is
a ruin Trojan PRISONERS are led off in chains Greek
soldiers carry gold treasures from the lavish temples and
palace

Funeral pyres fill the square One pyre taller than the
rest rises in the center of the square Odysseus stands
atop the highest pyre staring down at the body of
Achilles

For a long time Odysseus looks at the dead mans face He
knows the world will never see another Achilles Finally
he reaches inside his tunic pulls out two coins and
places them over Achilles eyes

ODYSSEUS
Find peace my brother

Odysseus climbs down from the pyre A LIEUTENANT hands

him a torch and Odysseus starts the fire The dry wood

quickly catches Black smokes rises toward the circling
crows

CLOSE on Odysseus as he watches his friend burn

EXT SCAMANDER RIVER - DAWN 202
A small band of Trojans marches east toward the rising

sun Helen and Paris Andromache and Scamandrius Aeneas
and the others -- alive They walk toward Mount Ida

Briseis walks behind the others She stops for a moment
and looks back toward the ruins of Troy

202

CLOSE on Briseis for a beat And then we see what she
sees the black smoke from Achilles pyre rising above
the smoldering city rising above the circling crows and
finally fading away into the deep blue sky

FADE OUT

THE END
