INT JAVEDS SAFE-HOUSE BATHROOM NIGHT

The thumping at the door continues The sound of mumbled
Indian prayer Dull gleam of a pistol A hand cracks the
chamber open Loads a single bullet and snaps the chamber
shut The hand clicks the cylinder round so that the
bullet is in line with the hammer Puts the pistol to his
head We still cannot see who this is

Under cover of the wild applause Prem ushers Amir
towards the guest’s chair leaning in and hissing

PREM (CONTD)

The lights seem to bore into him but Amir manages a
tentative smile Out of nowhere a hand slaps him
ferociously across the face Then again and again Blood
trickles from his mouth

INT POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM NIGHT

The studio lights have seamlessly transformed into the
harsh bulb of an interrogation light Amir is strung from
the ceiling by his arms

hair forcing him to stare directly into the lights

INT POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM DAY

Amir’s body dangles motionless from the ceiling His head
is bowed and he is moaning to himself The ceiling fan
thumps round slowly In the corner Sergeant Srinivas
mops his brow and lights a cigarette Hot work The door
opens and the Inspector of Police walks in A rumpled man
in his late forties who has seen pretty much everything

He eyes Am

ir surprised

INSPECTOR
Has he confessed yet

SERGEANT SRINIVAS
Apart from his name I can’t get a
word out of the runt

INSPECTOR

Srinivas What have you been
doing

Srinivas shrugs

SERGEANT SRINIVAS
Tough guy

INSPECTOR
A little electricity will loosen
his tongue

( )

Sergeant Srinivas brings a box and a tangle of wires out
of a cupboard and proceeds to put crocodile clips on
Amir’s fingers The Inspector stares deep in thought
Sweat trickles down his face He wipes it away with a
handkerchief seems to be talking to himself

INSPECTOR
Every night I get home “why can’t
we have ac like Bajan Chacha Why
don‘t you care about your poor
family dying in this heat”
Twenty-four years a policeman and
I can’t afford bloody ac

INSPECTOR (CONTD)
But you You’ve got half a million
rupees ek dum guaranteed yaar
And who knows how much further
Fancy the million do you

Amir just stares

INSPECTOR (CONTD)
I think you probably do

The Inspector nods absently to Sergeant Srinivas who
turns a handle Amir’s body pulsates and jerks He
screams His body goes limp again The Inspector goes
over to Amir

INSPECTOR (CONT’D)
So Were you wired up A mobile or
a pager correct Some little
hidden gadget No A coughing
accomplice in the audience
Microchip under the skin huh

Sergeant Srinivas hadn’t thought of that Grabs Amir’s
arms and starts squeezing them all over until the
Inspector has had enough

INSPECTOR (CONTD)
Srinivas Look it’s hot my wife
is giving me hell I’ve got a desk
full of murderers rapists
extortionists assorted bum-
fuckersand you Why don’t you
save us both a lot of time Hmm

Amir doesn’t answer The Inspector sighs and sits down
Looks at his watch nods at Sergeant Srinivas again
Amir’s body jerks with electric current

When the shudders and screams have subsided the
Inspector goes over to Amir’s collapsed form Clicks his
fingers in front of Amir’s face to check for a response

INSPECTOR OF POLICE
He’s unconscious chutiya What
good is that How many times have
I told you-

SERGEANT SRINIVAS
Sorry Sir

The door opens and a Constable walks in

CONSTABLE

The Inspector turns to Sergeant Srinivas with heavy
irony

INSPECTOR
Aré wa Srinivas Now we’ll have
Amnesty International in here

rights Get him down for Gods
sake and clean him up

Sergeant Srinivas goes over to Amir and starts to undo
the crocodile clips

INT INSPECTORS OFFICE DAY

Over the titles we see Amir in handcuffs being

shoved out

of the interrogation room and into the Inspectors
office Amir is shoved into a chair Sergeant Srinivas is

making a belated attempt to smooth Amir’s hair

straighten his shirt and fit him with a fake clip-on tie
as the door opens and the Inspector ushers in Mister
Johnson the English Producer of Who Wants To Be A
Millionaire carrying video tapes and a pile of books
Johnson gives Amir a sidelong glance rather shocked at

his appearance

INSPECTOR
A word Mister Johnson

They walk outside

INT CORRIDOR POLICE STATION DAY

short way of doing this

Johnson looks at his watch

Inspector

The Inspector watches him stalk down the corridor Wipes
the sweat from his face Goes back into the room

INT INSPECTOR’S OFFICE DAY

The Constable fiddles with a video recorder We get
snatches of filmi dancing- heroines singing on
mountainsides surrounded by implausible numbers of flags-
cricket and finally after some shouting by the Inspector
Who Wants to Be A Millionaire

INSPECTOR

Zanjeer

EXT CRICKET GROUND DAY

Bright sunlight filtered through the ever-present Mumbai
dust A group of children are playing cricket on a tarmac
cricket ground They are bare-foot dressed in little
more than rags wiry-skinny and fast on their feet
Salim a thick-set eleven-year old polishes the ball on
his almost non-existent shorts comes in with surprising
speed and bowls The batsman hooks it high in the air
The bowler screams at a boy in the outfield

SALIM
Amir Catch it Catch it

The nine-year old Amir stares up at the ball jinks
around trying to get into position He pays no heed to
the rest of the children who are scattering fast to the
edges of the tarmac The ball seems suspended in the blue
sky Shouts from the other children seem very far away
He doesn’t notice that they are screaming for him to get
out of the way Amir adjusts his feet for the perfect
catch Then out of nowhere a light aircraft almost takes
his head off as it comes in to land on the tarmac runway
Amir is knocked to his feet by the down-draft of the
plane The ball bounces away Also flattened Salim gets
to his feet

SALIM (CONTD)
How could drop that It was a
sitter

Then Salim’s face turns to one of alarm

EXT AIRPORT PERIMETER DAY

At the back of a pack of children Amir is running for
his life pursued by an ancient but surprisingly nimble
Security Guard from the airport who is screaming abuse
and wielding a long stick

The kids dash across a rubbish dump and disappear down
dozens of tiny lanes that run in between the shacks of
the slum

SECURITY GUARD
Private-ka land Private-ka land
The planes won’t kill you mader
chod I will

Amir and Salim break off head down a separate lane The
Guard pursues them

INT JUHU SLUM DAY

The lanes in between the corrugated iron shacks are three
feet wide with an open drain running down the middle
Many of the precarious upper floors of the shacks have
been built right over the paths turning them into black
tunnels Tunnels shot through with slivers of light If
you didn’t live here you would be lost and frightened in
minutes

But these children are natives and with the practice of
many years Amir and Salim zig-zag down the warren of
lanes

They dodge past people cooking in the doorways sleeping
washing clothes or in the case of Vinod a naked four
year-old pissing into the drain Salim shouts a warning

SALIM
Oi Vinod

Without breaking step they both jump expertly over the
stream of piss Not so the Security Guard who gets it all
over his trousers but doesn’t stop the pursuit

The two children charge past a shack filled to the roof
with chickens in cages who all start squawking They
break out into the sunlight of the ‘main road’ of the
slum lined with shops It is packed with people stalls
bicycles and cows All modern India is here drinking
tea shouting at each other selling food playing carom
video games Leaving a trail of shouting and wreckage
behind them the pair approach a brand new Mercedes
almost blocking the lane Beside it stands Javed an
impressive man in a beautiful suit and his two Minders
Amir and Salim skid to a stop put their hands together
in respectful greeting and edge ever so carefully past
the immaculate paintwork of the car

Still in pursuit the Security Guard also slides
carefully past the car with deprecating bows and smiles

On past the chi stall where a crowd has gathered to watch
a hindi film blaring from the tv rigged up overhead The
irate Security Guard gets tangled up in a bicycle Amir
and Salim stop to give him a taunting hip-gyrating
parody of the dance on the tv before scooting down
another tunnel They break out into sunlight again

WOMAN’S VOICE
Amir

Amir skids to a halt bumping into Salim who is already
frozen

AMIR
Shit Mamaji

AMIR‘S MOTHER
Don’t you move a muscle

The Security Guard arrives and he too skids to a halt at
the sight of Amir‘s mother

AMIR‘S MOTHER (CONT’D)
Thank you Mister Gupta I will
deal with these two

The Guard puts his hands together in grudging respect as
Amir’s Mother lifts each skinny kid off the floor by
their t-shirt and marches them down the road

INT SCHOOL DAY

The two renegades are dumped by Amir’s Mother into their
desks Mister Nandha the teacher stands and crashes an
English book down on Salim’s head The Three Musketeers

MISTER NANDHA
Salim

Salim opens the book Amir glances over and turns the
book the right way round for Salim

SALIM
I know

Mister Nandha hovers over Amir’s head He winces in
anticipation

MISTER NANDHA
And Amir

The book comes down like thunder Amir blinks from the
impact and suddenly we are back

INT STUDIO DAY

PREM

So You a movie fan Amir
Remember you have three lifelines

Ask the Audience 5050 and Phone
a Friend The question one more
time Who was the star of the 1973
hit film Zanjeer Is it A-

Close on Amir’s eyes

INT SHACK NIGHT

A tiny shack A garland of dirty plastic flowers
surrounds a torn flyer for one of Amitabh Bacchan’s
films

EXT JUHU SLUM RUBBISH DUMP DAY

Salim is sitting on a chair at the end of a rickety
wooden pier though it is not water but a sea of rubbish
and sewage that lies below them There are dozens of
these piers protruding from the slum onto airport land
each with a toilet shack perched right at the end
Another man hurries up the pier and hands Salim a coin

SALIM
Bhai get out of there Prakash
wants a shit

AMIR OS
Not finished

PRAKASH
Stop your time-pass This is
urgent

AMIR OS
It’s a shy one Since when was
there a time limit on a crap

SALIM
Since there was a customer
waiting that’s when

AMIR OS
(singing grunting)
Come on out you beauty unveil
yourself my darling-warling

PRAKASH
Look kid I got a bad stomach

A disturbing combination of heaving and snake-charmer
noises come from the toilet shack Finally Prakash can
stand it no longer

PRAKASH (CONTD)
I’m off to Devi’s bog Give me
that

He snatches the coin back from Salim and hurries off
Salim bangs on the toilet door

SALIM
You just lost me good money you
stupid idiot-—

Salim stops In the distance there is the faint sound of
shouting a crowd coming closer Then the crowd bursts
through the outer shacks of the slum pour onto the
rubbish dump and make for the airfield

MAN
It’s Amitabh That’s his
helicopter

AMIR OS

Amitabh Amitabh Bacchan

INTEXT TOILET DAY

Amir peers through one of the many cracks in the shack
He sees crowds surging around the pier charging towards
a landing helicopter Salim shoves the chair under the
door handle- effectively locking it- and runs down the
pier to join the chase Amir pulls up his shorts

AMIR
No Wait Salim sala Salim

Rattles the locked door stares hopelessly at the
disappearing crowd

AMIR (CONTD)
Wait Amitabh

He looks down the toilet hole at the sewage beneath him
the landing helicopter the disappearing crowd A final

rattle of the door There is only one way out He jumps

down the hole sprawling headlong into a year’s worth of
human waste Alive- if covered in shit- he pulls a torn

flyer out of his pocket and runs for the helicopter

AMIR (CONTD)
Amitabh-ji Amitabh-ji

Salim is at the back of the crowd trying to force a way
through but the adults shove him back Not so for Amir
The down-draft from the helicopter flicks bits of sewage
from his clothes Disgusted fans curse him and get out of
his way Suddenly the red sea parts and there is nobody
between Amir and Amitabh Bacchan getting out of the
helicopter

AMIR (CONT’D)
Please Amitabh-ji

Amir holds out his grubby flyer Used to signing
autographs the movie star barely looks at Amir He takes
the flyer then notices something distinctly unpleasant
on it To Amir’s delight he scribbles distastefully on
it

AMIR (CONTD)
A thousand thanks Amitabh-ji

Amir gets down on his knees and tries to kiss Amitabh’s
feet but Amitabh takes a couple of steps back now fully
aware where the smell is coming from Amir crawls faster
causing Amitabh to start skipping backwards There is a
brief undignified chase then he throws the flyer at
Amir as his bodyguards surround him and hustle him into a
car Amir chases the flyer across the tarmac grabs it
Kisses it

EXT JUHU SLUM NIGHT

From high up the rickety tin roof-tops of the slum seem
to stretch to the horizon There is a distant shout a
figure waving an arm

MAN
It’s coming

Then another shout and another a chain of voices coming
closer People come out of their doorways with pails and
buckets The shouts come closer until we see a naked
figure entirely encased in bubbles dancing and singing in
the lane Amir is the happiest boy in the slum

AMIR
(singing)
Amitabh Amitabh oh Amitabh I
have your autograph oh holy
Amitabh

MOTHER
Here it comes

Water comes bubbling through a hose and Amir’s mother
hoses down her ecstatic son

EXT JUHU SLUM NIGHT

Not far away Salim wanders to Mister Chi’s stall He
glances around to make sure everybody is glued to the
hindi film on Mister Chi’s tv and surreptitiously slips
Mister Chi the signed flyer Mister Chi takes a look and
gives Salim a small wad of rupees He sticks the money in
his pocket slinks away

EXT JUHU SLUM NIGHT

A tear-stained Amir is furiously trying to batter Salim
but Salim’s extra strength and height means that he can
keep Amir at bay with one hand Amir’s flailing fists
punching thin air

AMIR
Sala Salal

Salim’s laughter only makes Amir cry harder

INT INSPECTOR’S OFFICE DAY

Close on the tv screen in the Inspector’s office Prem

Instead of the usual slum chaos there is a strange quiet
in the slum A silent crowd has gathered around Mister
Chi‘s watching the large tv set Amir and Salim try to
get a view of what is on news footage of the destruction
of the Babri Masjid Some people in the crowd are crying
openly some look furious Others stand in doorways
watching with just a hint of pleasure

INT RAM’S HOUSE NIGHT

A sound so quiet we might not have heard it A deep drum
beat Amir and Salim lie on a mattress asleep On
another mattress lies their sleeping mother The drum
beats get louder followed by the faint sound of
chanting Amir wakes listens Prods Salim They sit up
Together they go to the door and out

EXT NIGHT SLUM

Amir and Salim creep through the deserted alleyways of
the slum heading for the sound of the drum beats
Slipping out of another door comes their friend Krishna
Through gaps in the streets tantalising glimpses of
fierce faces lit by lanterns Then they round a corner
and suddenly are confronted by a wall of colour and noise
and threat three decorated Gods on a processional
chariot surrounded by chanting acolytes and men banging
drums

ACOLYTES
Om Jai Jagdeesh Haré Om Jai
Jagdeesh Haré

Amir stares at the Gods

AMIR
Who are they

Krishna stares at him

KRISHNA
You don’t know

Amir shakes his head Behind them Amir’s Mother appears

AMIR’S MOTHER
Come Come away

She pushes the two children back down the street Krishna
watches them go then turns back to the procession

KRISHNA
Om Jai Jagdeesh Haré

EXT DHOBI JUHU SLUM DAY

Right next to the railway lines is a pond of dirty water
surrounded by shacks in which dozens of women are washing
clothes Trains flash past only feet away from them Down
the other end of the pond Amir and Salim are splashing
noisily with Krishna and some friends Amir’s mother
pauses in her scrubbing wipes sweat from her forehead
and gazes up at the leaden sky

Amir is trying to intercept the ball that Salim and
Krishna are throwing to each other He’s not having much
success The ball flies overhead again from Salim to
Krishna Amir dives for it misses and goes underwater
When he comes up for air he shakes his head clearing
his ears of water Then he stops listens Shakes his
head again Definitely something strange Thunder Salim
and Krishna are trading catches unaware that anything
has changed But Amir’s mother has heard it too The
faintest sound of shouting roaring The wave of noise is
still faint but getting louder A frozen moment broken
by

MOTHER
Run Amir Salim run

Everybody stares at her A train speeds through as she
continues to shout her words lost beneath the thundering
train

MOTHER (CONT’D)
Go Run

The train goes through the last carriage flying past
suddenly opening up the sight of a wall of rioting men
wielding clubs scythes metal bars They come screaming
across the railway tracks

SALIM
Krishna quick

Salim holds out his hand to Krishna who is wading with
difficulty through the water

KRISHNA
No way You’re a bloody Muslim
Get away from me

The rioters leap the tracks and are upon them

KRISHNA (CONT’D)
They’re Muslims Him and him

MOTHER
Go

Salim and Amir scramble out and retreat into the lanes
Amir turns to see his Mother felled by a rioter She is
surrounded by screaming chanting men who rain blows down
on her Salim grabs Amir and drags him down an alley As
they head down the alley they get glimpses of burning
houses fleeing women An eleven-year old girl ducks out
of a doorway and runs after them

They turn a corner and head towards some vans full of
police Amir sees Mister Nandha the school teacher
stops

AMIR
Salim

Then Mister Nandha starts walking towards him An oasis
of calm in the chaos Amir looks at him with relief

They reach the safety of the police vans But inside the
vans the police are smoking laughing playing cards
Down the street a man comes whirling out of a doorway
his hair on fire He falls into the middle of the street
and is engulfed by rioters Unperturbed the police

one of the police men turns looks at them Is
interested Motions to a colleague Puts out his
cigarette with purpose

Salim shakes his head fiercely silencing Amir for a
moment But only a moment

hurls it at her She dodges takes a couple of steps back
but makes no real attempt to get away He finds another
rock and hurls this in her direction too

faces

INT BUILDER’S YARD NIGHT

Rain as you’ve never seen A pile of huge water pipes in

INT BUILDER’S YARD LATER

Amir wakes with a jolt and a scream half-swallowed in his
mouth He shuts his eyes tight trying to force the image
out His breathing slows and he sees the girl staring at
him The rain is still falling She goes back to drawing
shapes in the mud with her finger Amir stares at her for

descending river of people out of his way the seventeen
year-old Amir is forging a path up steps that cross the
platforms He pushes to the middle of the footbridge and
leans out on the side railings He scans the sea of
people desperately Then he sees her the eighteen year-
old Latika heart-stoppingly beautiful over the other
side of the station A world away She is scanning the
crowd as wired as he is

AMIR

But though he is screaming her name his voice is
swallowed by the noise around him Then he sees Salim and
another man also fighting a way towards her

Frightened now he fights his way down the steps one
figure against an army of white-robed people He gets to

INSPECTOR OF POLICE
Bean bags

EXT MUMBAI STREET NIGHT

In the darkness Amir is studying a piece of paper and
reading out numbers from it There is something not quite
right about Amir- perhaps the fact that there are two
feet by his ears Salim is standing on his shoulders and
spraying the numbers on a wall with an aerosol and a
certain lack of confidence

AMIR
four nine zero nine- the one
with the stick going down Salim-
six- stick going up-

Latika’s head appears from around the corner She hisses
But they don’t hear Hisses again Then she is running
for her life past the pair of them

AMIR (CONTD)
Six one shit let’s go-

Salim collapses off Amir’s shoulders and all three run
off down an alley past a dozen of the gang’s sprayed-on
adverts all reading “Beanbags- 22 4909661” A fat
Security Guard with a long stick huffs round the corner

SECURITY GUARD
Got you now little fuckers

They gaze desperately around the cul-de-sac Trapped But
there is a way up the wall via some drain pipes Salim
and Amir scramble up the pipes Latika follows but is
pulled back down by the guard Amir is balanced on the
top of the wall Salim already safe on the other side

SALIM
Come on Let’s go

Amir looks down Latika has curled up into a foetal
position a tiny ball at the feet of the Security Guard
staring up at him just waiting to be beaten The Guard
lifts the stick over his head

SECURITY GUARD
First the stick little rabbit
Then we have some fun

SALIM
Amir Come on

Amir considers safety one side a beating on the other
then jumps onto the head of the Security Guard They both
topple into the dirt

AMIR
Go

Latika scrambles up the drainpipes as Amir dodges around
the Guard-

AMIR (CONT’D)
Hey fart-bag Wheel your fat
belly over here why don’t you
Come on if you dare I’11 take
you I’1l take you

Amir briefly and ridiculously squares up does a few mock
karate chops and then scarpers getting a few painful
strikes as he goes

EXT WASTE GROUND DAWN

Beneath giant advertising hoardings the size of a tower
block the three children sit around an open fire cooking
rice in a battered pot Their shelter is made of a couple
of sheets of plastic held up with sticks Amir is lying
wincing in pain as Salim examines the purple weals on his
back and the top of his legs Latika stands at a
distance watching

SALIM
Hissing What kind of a bloody
leok-out is that Hissing Know
what She can talk if she wants
to Can’t you

He marches up to her grabs her by the hair and drags her
towards Amir

SALIM (CONT’D)
Can‘t you

He tugs her head back painfully Her mouth opens in
protest but no sound comes out

SALIM (CONTD)
I’ve heard you At night I’ve
heard you

AMIR
Leave her Those are bad dreams
That’s different

SALIM
What does she do the fucking

Latika struggles free and stalks off They watch her
begin to climb the scaffolding that supports the tower-
block-sized advertising hoardings

EXT WASTE GROUND DAY

Amir and Salim lie in the baking midday heat under their
make-shift camp Amir shields his eyes tries to see
Latika high up the scaffolding

AMIR
What’s she doing up there

SALIM
Getting ready to jump I hope

Salim closes his eyes Amir quietly gets to his feet and
painfully makes his way to the scaffolding He starts up
it

EXT SCAFFOLDING DUSK

Amir and Latika sit on a platform a hundred feet in the
air their feet dangling in space The tiny dot below
them is Salim moving around the fire

AMIR
He’s alright really He just
wants to be in charge You just
have to pretend that he is then
he’s fine

They stare down at him Then Latika touches Amir’s leg
looks at the weal from the Security Guard’s stick

AMIR (CONT’D)
It’s okay

Latika strokes Amir’s leg He doesn’t really know how to
react to this Starts gabbling

AMIR (CONT’D)
The thing I don’t understand is
why I mean beanbags Bags of
beans Why do they need to phone
up They can get them in the
market can’t they Maybe they‘re
special bags of beans or- aré

They roll around on the platform Amir giggling

EXT WASTE GROUND DUSK

Salim prods the fire with a stick He stares up at the
scaffolding trying to see the two tiny figures Hears
the laughter Flings the stick into the darkness

from Latika’s throat and they are both laughing and
rolling around on the deck mock-fighting Exhausted

She indicates the mammoth hoarding behind them and pulls
two spray cans from her torn shorts Amir gets it

dirt but stops and stares

Salim are sleeping out the hottest part of the day Amir

alluring hiss It is almost an advert for thirst-

Untrained but pure Mamam looks at the Teacher The

lusty and appallingly out of tune Maman winces and moves
on The boy next to Salim giggles Immediately Salim is
on him Before a fight breaks out Punnoose pulls Salim
off the boy and hurls him across the room Salim gets up
and charges at Punnoose For a second Punnoose is back-
footed but then pins Salim’s arms to his side Maman

appearance must be a villager Punnoose and Salim sit
behind Arvind

MAMAN

Very good very good I am
pleased Arvind He is ready

ARVIND
Ready

Maman nods to Punnoose Before Arvind can turn round
Punnoose has covered his mouth with a cloth and after the
briefest of struggles Arvind’s body goes limp The
villager puts an old tin box on the table Taking the lid
from the tin he brings out a cloth and unwraps it
Inside is a spoon He checks the edge with his thumb
Sharp Douses it with whisky and passes it over a candle
flame The spoon ignites with blue flame for a moment
The villager wipes it with the cloth nods to Punnoose

PUNNOOSE
Salim

Utterly bemused Salim nevertheless helps Punnoose lay
Arvind on the table The villager takes hold of Arvind’s
eyelid and pulls it open He brings the spoon close
Suddenly Salim is being sick in the corner of the shack
By the time he has turned back the villager is wiping
the spoon on a blood-soaked rag

Salim and Amir are sitting on top of the train Amir is
staring blankly down the track

SALIM
Do I have to tell you a hundred
times chutiya She tripped What
could I do Aré come on

Amir wipes the tears from his eyes furiously

AMIR
We have to go back We can’t just
leave her

SALIM
He‘1ll kill us if we go back He
was going to take your eyes out
for God’s sake With a bloody
spoon She‘ll be alright She
always is

Salim gets up and starts walking unsteadily along the
roof of the train carriage

AMIR
Where you going

SALIM
First class bhai Where else

INT EXT FIRST CLASS CARRIAGE MORNING

The ancient train is huffing slowly up an incline A

middle class Indian couple with their three children are

sitting at a table their breakfast spread before them

Into this domestic scene unseen by them comes Amir
Upside down and still outside the train he is clearly
being dangled by his ankles from the train roof He gives
a few silent directional signs to Salim who manoeuvres
him across dips his hand into the open window snatches
a chapatti and signals franticly to be hoisted up The
family continue to eat unperturbed

Then Amir appears again This time one of the children
spots him Despite Amir giving her a friendly wave she
yelps The father of the group grabs Amir’s hand which
has just snatched a samosa There is a tussle Salim
holding onto Amir’s legs the father holding onto Amir’s
arms and Amir in the middle shouting Salim is losing
the battle and his footing He stumbles and the pair of
them fall from the train rolling and tumbling down an
embankment in slow-motion Interspersed with the
seemingly endless tumble are images of Amir and Salim on
top of different trains-

- huddled together against the freezing rain
- surfing the wind at the front of the train
- admiring the distant Himalaya

AMIR VO
We criss-crossed the country from
Rajasthan to Calcutta always
thrown off always getting back
on This was our home A home with
wheels and a whistle

The final tumble as they crash onto flat ground

EXT RAILWAY EMBANKMENT DAY

Groggily Amir sits up and groans Somehow in the tumble
he has been transformed into a fourteen year-old And
Salim a strong sixteen year-old Through the haze of pain
and dust Amir sees something glinting in the distance-
something impossibly beautiful

AMIR
Is this heaven

SALIM
You’re not dead chutiya

Amir clears his head Sees Salim picking himself up from
the ground But the apparition is still there

AMIR
So what’s that

SALIM
Wow

They stare at the apparition The unmistakable outline of
the Taj Mahal rises from the horizon pink in the morning
sun Nothing could be more beautiful

AMIR
Must be a hotel

EXT TAJ MAHAL DAY

Amir and Salim wander under the great dome of the Taj
Mahal Two tiny slum kids dwarfed by this massive
monument to love It is a moment of genuine wonderment
for them Then a tour guide bustles nearby tourists
flowing behind him

GUIDE
«-there are five main elements to
the Taj The Darwaza the main
gateway the Bageecha or garden
the Masjid or mosque the Naqqar
Khana the rest house and the
Rauza or mausoleum If you would
like to follow me I will show you
the ninety-nine names of Allah on
Mumtaz’s tomb As before please
remove your shoes

The Guide heads into the mausoleum followed by the crowd
of tourists Bored Salim makes a face at the Guide
while Amir slips in at the back of the group and follows
Salim spots the rows and rows of shoes left outside the
mausoleum Looks around Takes off his flip-flops and
stacks them neatly in line Puts his feet next to a nice
pair of mocassins finds them the wrong size and moves on
to the next pair He looks around is about to put his
feet into them when a large street kid looms up behind
him

SHANKAR
Take those shoes and I’11 kill
you

SALIM

Sorry they look just like mine-

He turns round and sees the source of the voice Sizes
him up
SALIM (CONT’D)
- oh and they’re yours are they

SHANKAR
I’m looking after them

He makes the universal baksheesh sign with his hands
Salim immediately spots a fellow traveller

SALIM
Ahh What if they don’t pay

SHANKAR
Godbole’s Uncle has a shoe shop in
Delhi

SALIM
First class What about the cops

SHANKAR
Every now and then we have to
catch somebody and turn them in
Or at least pretend to

SALIM
Right

Salim processes this information Sees an opening

SALIM (CONT’D)
Do you-

SHANKAR
You wouldn’t mind We haven’t had
a chase for a while now

SALIM
Kid you couldn’t catch me if you
tried

He snatches up the shoes he was trying on and races
across the marble floor of the Taj

SHANKAR
Hey Stop thief Stop thief

The cry is taken up by the other street kids who all hare
after him screaming theatrically

EXT TAJ MAHAL MAUSOLEUM DAY

Amir comes out of the mausoleum into the bright sunlight
and looks around for Salim No sign of him Amir happens

to be standing right next to the booth advertising guided
tours when a German couple approach

ADA

tour
AMIR
Err-
PETER

- so much waiting around in this
damned country

AMIR
No I-

ADA
- were on a very tight schedule

would cost more for just the two
of us

Peter waves a couple of thousand rupee notes at Amir His
eyes widen

AMIR
But of course Madam Please
follow me

Amir stalks off The Germans follow Amir stops before
the monument Points a confident arm at it

AMIR (CONT’D)
This isthe Taj Mahal

A terrible pause as Peter and Ada stare at him Clearly
more is expected He moves off at a pace

AMIR (CONT‘D)
The Taj Mahal was built by the
Emperor Khurram for his wife
Mumtaz who was maximum beautiful
woman in the whole world When she
died the Emperor decided to build
this five star hotel for everyone
who wanted to visit her tombbut
he died in- in fifteen eighty-
seven before any of the rooms
were built Or the lifts The
swimming pool however as you can
see was completed on schedule in
top class fashion

He waves confidently in the direction of the fountains

ADA
It says nothing of this in the
guide book

AMIR
With respect Madam the guide
book is written by a bunch of
lazy Indian good-for-nothing
beggars

ADA
Oh

AMIR
And this Lady and Gentleman is
burial place of Mumtaz

ADA
How did she die
AMIR
A road traffic accident
ADA
Really
AMIR
Maximum pile-up
PETER
(suspicious)

I thought she died in child-birth

AMIR
(nedding sagely)
Exactly Sir She was on the way
to the hospital when it happened

Amir moves on Ada and Peter exchange a glance

ADA
(shrugging)
You’ve seen the way they drive
around here

wheels are being removed Salim takes a hacksaw to the
Mercedes badge on the bonnet whilst urging the others
on

A shout from the top of the lane and the boys scatter
bouncing the four wheels at speed down the lane Amir
the Indian driver and the two Americans return They stop
in front of the denuded car

CLARK
Woah What happened here

Suddenly the Indian driver is slapping Amir ferociously
around the head with one of his shoes

DRIVER

Amir is dodging the traffic at a busy junction He moves
around the beggars who are working the cars Then he
hears singing He looks around suddenly panicked It is
a siren song drawing him across the road not even
noticing that he is narrowly run down by a couple of
cars to a traffic island underneath a flyover

He turns a corner and there is the singer leaning up
against one of the struts of the flyover Arvind Older
now just like Amir a fourteen year-old boy But eye-
less Amir freezes He approaches Arvind and waits until
he has finished singing Despite his eyeless sockets
Arvind appears to know somebody is there He turns and
bows low putting his hands together

EXT PILA STREET NIGHT

Dark crowded streets Gangs of women stand outside the
doorways or lean out of upstairs windows They are
garishly-dressed prostitutes varying in age from 13 to
60 Men wander past eying the possibilities exchanging
lewd comments with them Among the hordes on the pavement
are Amir and Salim They pass doorway after doorway of
Narrow rooms where prostitutes wait for customers Amir
and Salim stop at each group of women Amir clearly
asking them something as the women either shrug or offer
them something lewd- judging by the laughter that
follows But one woman in a narrow doorway points down
the street Amir has to drag a reluctant Salim away from
the group

staircase The Woman picks up the phone on her desk

On the tiny landing Salim and Amir pull back a curtain
to reveal a humping couple They move on past more women
lying on their beds or blankly having sex not in the
least perturbed to be interrupted They reach the end of
the landing From the other side of the door comes the
filmi music Amir puts his eye to one of the gaps in the
slatted door Through it he can see glimpses of a girl
dancing to the music Latika though not the rag-picker
of before Now fifteen she is a beautiful young woman
and dressed in a revealing turquoise silk sari

SALIM
Is it her or not

He shoves Amir out of the way and watches

SALIM (CONTD)
Shit she’s sexy man

Then the music stops an effeminate man steps into the
limited frame Salim can see and snaps a stick down hard
on Latika’s hand

trigger Or tries to Nothing happens There is a frozen
moment as they watch him fail to shoot Everybody watches
with surreal interest as Salim fumbles with the pistol
Eventually he looks up giggles stupidly

surprised than Maman who crumples onto the floor Latika
starts desperately gathering up the notes on the floor

Just one more thing to do Sir

Johnson looks worried

INSPECTOR (CONT’D)
This way please

The Inspector puts the handcuffs on Amir and escorts him
from the stage

INT POLICE JEEP NIGHT

Amir sits silent in the back seat next to the Inspector
as Srinivas drives through the traffic Then

AMIR
Truth alone triumphs huh I
should have known better

INSPECTOR
Stop
Srinivas stops the police jeep The Inspector gets out of
the jeep Unlocks the handcuffs Holds the back door open
for Amir
INSPECTOR (CONT’D)
Thought you might need a lift
Sir

He nods towards the outside world Dazed Amir gets out

EXT CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS DAY

The police jeep pulls away Amir finds himself gazing up
at VT station Slowly he wanders inside

INT CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS NIGHT

VT station is awash with the evening commute Thousands
of people crowd the platforms jostling the only still
figure who is sitting at the base of the statue of
Frederick Stevens Amir Then there is a gap in the wall
of bodies that swirls around him Amir gets to his feet

AMIR
Latika

Then she is gone in the melee again Only to reappear

LATIKA
Amir

Amir forces himself through the people Nothing will stop
him Latika too is shoving them aside until they are face-
to-face They stop look at each other hold each other’s
hands tight The whole station seems frozen the only
movement from a thousand bodies being Amir and Latika

LATIKA (CONTD)
I thought we would meet again only
in death

He shakes his head

AMIR
I knew you’d be watching

Amir puts his hand on Latika’s chin turns her head
gently so that she is facing him He sees the knife scars
on her cheek for the first time She tries to turn her
head but he won’t let her Runs his hand slowly down the
scar Rests his hand there

AMIR (CONTD)
This is our destiny

He gently kisses the scarred cheek

AMIR (CONTD)
This is our destiny

The camera pulls back and back rising above the station
The music starts and the frozen station comes alive two
thousand kurta-clad men and saree-clad women dancing in
and out and on top of the trains an unbound celebration
of hope and humanity that has at its centre Amir and
Latika

THE END
