FADE IN

EXT CENTRAL PARK -- SEPTEMBER AFTERNOON

A COUPLE moves down a walkway deep in subdued

All around them trees explode with autumn color Birds
Their path is dappled with leafy shadow

To their left on the sunny meadow TEENAGERS throw
and footballs smoke cigarettes and joints drink beer
soda savoring the waning hours of summer

CLOSER ON THE COUPLE

He is WILLS KEANE late 40s to early 50s strikingly
handsome impeccably dressed and supremely poised At

glance he has the proud glow of a hedonist who in the
against time has been the undisputed victor

Only a closer look hints at the toll of battle His
strain under the weight of so much repetition His eyes
touched by regret The lines in his face reveal an

disenchantment not so much with the world as with

Walking at his side is a WOMAN 30 attractive and

Her name is unimportant because so many have come
and if the past prevails so many will come after
She listens intently as Wills finishes speaking --

WILLS
-- and I could have waited to tell
you but I wanted to leave no room
for misunderstanding

WOMAN
Well you certainly didnt

EXT ANOTHER CENTRAL PARK WALKWAY -- LATER

Still talking quietly they pass into a more secluded

area
of the park--
WOMAN
No I see how you could feel this
way Of course I do Its human But
what I dont get is why youd want
to announce it so quickly I mean
we just met Feelings change You
dont even know me
WILLS
Yes I do
She is amused by his confidence --
WOMAN
Oh really
WILLS
The minute I laid eyes on you Its
the saddest thing about getting older
You know people so quickly I even
knew youd end up hating me
WOMAN
Well youre wrong I dont
WILLS
(with a weary smile)
Give it time
She laughs Then he stops He hears something She
stops
She hears it too Its a GIRLS VOICE He casually
turns

and looks squinting into the sun
He takes a few steps and there between trees he sees

TWO

DOZEN PEOPLE sitting on the grass and on folding chairs

most are middle-aged or older with a distinctly
intellectual-

bohemian look to them

Standing and addressing them is CHARLOTTE FIELDING 19
fair

willowy pale lovely in an unconventional way She
wears an

eccentric hat and a vintage dress Her bearing is
upright

her gaze warm and intelligent her voice rich with
emotion --

CHARLOTTE

-- and for weeks I sat by her bed
and cried I told her I loved her
and I begged her not to leave me
All I could think about was what Id
lose if she died And then one
night she was in really bad pain
I stopped thinking about myself for
a second and I thought about her

(fighting tears)
I stopped crying I said goodbye
And in less than an hour Ella was
gone

The woman whispers in Wills ear --

WOMAN
Its so sad

But Wills ignores her He watches Charlotte with keen
interest touched by the depth and sincerity of her
emotion

CHARLOTTE

I really think its possible to hold
a person back cry them back
from dying Thats what I did to
Ella and Ill never do it to anyone
else again

(softly)
I hope no one ever does it to me

She looks out at the group many of whom are crying A
tear
But

away

Wills

bustling

of

wire

backpack

Wheeling

runs down her cheek She smiles and wipes it away
The woman seeing Wills interest in the girl whispers
WOMAN
So what do you know about her
He knows a great deal Or at least he thinks he does
his answer is nonchalant --

WILLS
That shes just a kid

He takes the woman gently by the elbow and guides her
He steals one last look back

Charlotte returning to where she was sitting notices
Their eyes meet and a charge passes between them
Meanwhile an OLD MAN has risen from his chair --

OLD MAN
I met Ella at City College in 1938

Wills slowly turns and walks away

An antique clock ticks crisply on the dresser Wills
before a mahogany mirror buttoning a freshly laundered
shirt
Lying on the cradle bed half-wrapped in a sheet naked
for a string of pearls is TANYA 35 raven-haired
thin She smokes a cigarette
TANYA
Oh Wills please not again Its

a rut
WILLS
But I thought you loved it

She stretches with her cigarette but before she can
make it

to the ashtray her ASH FALLS on a New York magazine
On the cover is a PHOTOGRAPH OF WILLS standing next to

YOUNG CHEF in a fashionable restaurant The caption
reads

The Prodigal Son Returns

TANYA
Oh I do -- except for the fact that
there isnt a single thing on the
menu I can eat

WILLS
(with a chuckle)
Sure there is theres just very
little youre willing to digest

He slips in a cuff link She affects a breezy
indifference --

TANYA
Fine then Well go Ill get big
fat and horrible and itll serve
you right

Wills slips on a silk tie --

WILLS
No it wont Because it takes at
least a few weeks to get fat and by

then you wont even be speaking to
me

TANYA
(curiously)

Why do you say that

He stops tying his tie and stares at her in the mirror

WILLS
Because we have no future All I can
offer you is this what we have
right now nothing more

meaningful until it ends

She stares at him speechless
INT RESTAURANT -- THAT NIGHT
Its decor is exquisitely tasteful its ambiance warm
convivial The night is in full swing Most of the
are taken and the bar is packed
EXT UPPER EAST SIDE -- SAME
From amid the RUSH OF TRAFFIC a TAXI breaks free and
to the curb in front of the RESTAURANT
Its facade is windowless Only a small brass plaque on
grey marble reveals that this is ELYSIUM

Wills and ERIKO 30s Japanese aloof and stunning

from the taxi elegantly dressed and move to the front

INT ELYSIUM -- CONTINUOUS
TWO TIPSY DEBUTANTES pass Wills and Eriko as they

WILLS
Good evening Celia And how --
CELIA

CELIA

Celia barely making eye contact with Eriko walks
quickly
away Wills is amused and a little confused by Celias
behavior He lays a hand on Erikos back --
WILLS

Eriko nods and follows Celia
Wills moves to the reservation stand where his best
friend
and the restaurants manager JOHN VOLPE 40 a
brilliant

someone on the telephone
Wills lays a hand on his shoulder and mutters into his
ear --

with his head in Erikos direction --

JOHN
So whos the new potential ex-wife

time with Tanya-von-Whats-her-name

WILLS
We wisely agreed to cut our losses

Wills exits into the bar John smiles and shakes his

FOLLOW WILLS as he glides along the bar CUSTOMERS and
greet him warmly

As he enters the main dining room DINERS spot him --
sprinkled among them are CELEBRITIES from every walk of

life Wills greets them stopping to shake their hands
kiss their cheeks

Suddenly Celia the hostess red-faced blocks his

Wills smiles pats her in the shoulder and moves on

She

cant believe it

A WAITER carrying a BIRTHDAY CAKE -- blazing with
candles

and decorated with a WOMANS HAT made of MERINGUE
LATTICEWORK --

passes by on his way to the REAR DINING ROOM

From inside VOICES begin to sing HAPPY BIRTHDAY
Wills his

curiosity piqued follows

INT REAR DINING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

The waiter sets down the cake at the center of a round
table

Theres a CHEER and APPLAUSE as the song ends Wills
cannot

see whose birthday it is because the waiter blocks his
view

Just as Wills is about to exit the room the waiter
steps

away Wills glances over and sees the birthday girl At
first

he cant place her but then he does and his face
softens

and brightens

Its Charlotte She wears a black velvet dress and a

wonderfully eccentric hat Her eyes glow in the
candlelight

Through the chorus of voices urging her to make a
wish she
cries out --

CHARLOTTE
You guys Let me think
(concentrating)

Okay Okay

Charlotte blows hard and with a little more effort

than

you might expect extinguishes the candles Everyone
APPLAUDS

and CHEERS

To Charlottes right sits SIMON LORING late 20s
English

sardonic adoring He gestures at her CHEST and says --

spindly

mixed

SIMON
Watch carefully everyone -- they
ought to begin emerging any moment
now

Everyone laughs Charlotte playfully slaps him --

Charlotte

CHARLOTTE

at my feet

SIMON
Oh darling you know I would if I
could

s best friend SHANNON HARRIS 19 a spoiled

big-hearted redhead drowning in curls mutters --

SHANNON
The only time he falls at your feet
now is when he wants to borrow your
Prada loafers

More laughter

BACK TO WI

LLS He considers approaching Charlotte but

he looks back and sees Eriko sitting alone at their

idly stabbing at her drink with a straw

Regretting his rudeness he takes a step toward her

then hears

WOMANS VOICE
Is that Wills Keane

He turns and sees DOLORES TALBOT 70 blonde wig

frame weathered skin large sad eyes She holds a

drink --

WOMAN
It sure as hell is and he hasnt
changed a bit

WILLS

WOMAN

Dolly

His smile shows uneasy surprise --

WILLS
My God it is

DOLLY

of the cocktail

As he hugs Dolores he cant help but look over at
Charlotte
again

DOLLY

here Last I heard you were out in
earthquake country blowin the family
fortune

WILLS
Actually I doubled it

DOLLY
Good for you

ON CHARLOTTE She looks over Her view is such that she
sees
Wills but not Dolores

A faint blush creeps into Charlottes cheeks She
pretends
to listen as Shannon tells a story --

SHANNON
-- and you know how bouncers get

ID Ive ever seen And Im like
Yeah Well you have the worst dread-
extensions And then just when --

Noticing Charlottes distraction Simon whispers calmly

Charlotte watches furtively as Simon rises from his

and walks over As he passes Wills

smile Wills is confused by it

CHARLOTTE
Okay look

Shannon swivels her head and throws an aloof vacant

in Wills direction Then she looks back at Charlotte

agape --

SHANNON
Hes as old as my dad
Charlotte laughs

BACK ON WILLS He does his best to be attentive as
Dolores

exhales a plume of smoke into his face --

DOLLY
Sure LAs okay if youre a cactus
or a lizard but if youre a New
Englander your soul dries up and
blows away like a god damn leaf

WILLS
It only took me twenty years to come
to my senses

DOLLY
So whatre you doin now You owned
some restaurants out there didnt

ON CHARLOTTE She sits listening to Shannon --

SHANNON
And so after all that we pay our
cover we get in and its totally

Charlotte looks over and pales her eyes widening --

CHARLOTTE

SHANNON

Dolores walks up hauling Wills by the arm --

DOLLY
Kids I want you to meet an old chum

establishment -- Wills Keane

The table greets him Wills slightly self-conscious
looks

at everyone but Charlotte

DOLLY
And that over theres the birthday

The news hits Wills hard But he does his best to hide

it
He musters a casual smile --
WILLS

DOLLY

dad But her talents all Katies
Dolores indicates the hat that Charlottes wearing --
DOLLY

(to Shannon)
Honey show im
Shannon makes an elaborate comic show of modeling the
hat
shes wearing The table laughs
Wills levels his gaze at Charlotte --
WILLS
mpressive
Try as she might to accept the compliment with grace
Charlotte cant help but grin
CHARLOTTE
Thanks
The WINE STEWARD stands at a station on which sit TWO
BOTTLES
OF CHAMPAGNE on ice He reaches for one Wills stops
him --
WILLS

The steward understanding nods and departs taking
the

champagne with him

WILLS
Happy birthday Charlotte

CHARLOTTE

As

Amused he flashes Charlotte his most dazzling smile

A pleasure to see you again

Wills turns to exit Simon returning to his seat
seductively to Wills as he passes by --

SIMON
Leaving so soon

Wills looks at him confused again then continues
Simon sits he mutters to Charlotte --

SIMON
Be still my beating heart
(beat)
Or is that your heart

SHANNON

Youre not really into him are you

Charlotte turns to Dolores who has just sat down

Charlotte runs over to her sewing table looking for a

pen

INT BROWNSTONE LIVING ROOM -- AFTERNOON

The furniture is antique and dark The white walls are
with yellow from years of cigarettes In one corner
paint has chipped off the ceiling in a jagged plate
Dolores sits on a worn-out leather arm chair smoking
a cocktail watching a DAYTIME TALK SHOW

In the background we see Charlotte working in the

DINING ROOM which she has turned into a lovely sewing

CLOSER ON CHARLOTTE She builds her hat on a HAT BLOCK
wooden mannequin head Strewn all around her are the
of her hatmaking -- bolts of cloth hat blocks a
table
Shannon wearing sweats and a T-shirt lies on the
eating MMs and drinking diet soda while heavily
up a text book with a YELLOW HIGHLIGHTER
Charlotte stops and rubs her eyes then she glances
Shannon and smiles --

CHARLOTTE

Why dont you mark what isnt
important That way youll save ink
SHANNON
Why dont you sew your mouth to my
butt That way youll stop annoying
me

They both laugh Overhearing Dolores croaks

facetiously --
DOLLY
Now now if you two kids cant play

Shannon rolls over onto her back --
SHANNON
God I hate school
Charlotte pins a strip of black lace to the hat --
CHARLOTTE
Oh come on just last week you
said you were on a roll You loved
it
SHANNON
Well now Im on the rag and I hate
it
Charlotte chuckles and sets the half-finished hat on
her
head Still seated she wheels her work chair over to a
mirror --

CHARLOTTE
I think youre incredibly lucky Id
love to be going to college

Shannon rolls over and looks at her Suddenly her
expression
is inexplicably solemn --

SHANNON
Am I the most spoiled brat in the
world or what

CHARLOTTE
Spoiled brats dont even ask questions
like that
(re the hat)
What do you think
she

She models the hat Tears well in Shannons eyes and
says without even a hint of irony or sentimentality --
SHANNON
That youre the most beautiful person

Charlotte smiles looks away and trying not to cry
with the hat
EXT CENTRAL PARK WEST -- NIGHT
A cold autumn rain falls The Irish doorman MICHAEL
melancholy stoop-shouldered smokes a cigarette
at the unburdening sky
A LIMOUSINE pulls up The passenger window glides down
DRIVER

DOORMAN
A bit early arent you

DRIVER

and sneakers dashing at breakneck speed down the

carrying something in a GARBAGE BAG

She runs right past Michael --
INT ELEVATOR -- NIGHT

Michael works the shiny brass controls Charlotte
overhead

over

and

checks

sopping
the

breath and

approaching

to

hair dripping wet watches the numbers tick by
Michael smiles at her with paternal fondness --

MICHAEL

Charlotte nonplused by his lack of discretion smiles
politely --

CHARLOTTE
Oh really

INT WILLS PENTHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
The elevator doors open

MICHAEL
Watch your step Miss

CHARLOTTE
Thank you

She emerges moves to Wills door and waits for the
to close When it does she hurries back to a table
which hangs a GILDED MIRROR

She takes a LOVELY OLD HAT BOX out of the garbage bag
ditches the bag under the table Then she quickly
herself in the glass

She doesnt like what she sees She pokes at her

hair and squeezes it but its hopeless Remembering
time she hurries back to the door takes a deep
rings the bell

She waits And waits Then she hears footsteps

She realizes shes left the hat box on the table

She rushes over and grabs it just in time to get back

the door when it OPENS
Olivia the housekeeper steps out wearing her coat
and
carrying her purse Her voice is low and gentle --

OLIVIA
Hes waitin for you Miss Fieldin

They exchange cordial smiles Charlotte enters
INT WILLS APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

Charlotte steps into a dim hallway lined with oil
paintings

carpeted with a Persian runner and lighted by three
antique

sconces She walks slowly terribly self-conscious

INT WILLS LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

The room is vast furnished with antiques decorated
with

the same masculine good taste Charlotte enters
timidly

then hears --

WILLS
What happened

She looks and sees Wills standing back turned before

broad set of high windows City lights glimmer in the
distance beneath them lies the vast gloom of Central
Park

CHARLOTTE
I couldnt get a cab so I took the
subway only it was an express and
it didnt stop at --

WILLS
You realize dont you that youre
a full eighteen minutes late

CHARLOTTE
I know Im so sorry I --

Wills turns around A magnificent figure -- expertly
tailored

tux every hair in place freshly manicured And then
he

offers her an amused reassuring smile --
unties
sublimely

face

her

and

feels

tones --

WILLS
Charlotte relax Whats the point
of being a beautiful young woman if
it isnt to keep your admirers
waiting In fact you disappoint me
I was looking forward to at least
another half hour of suspense

Flattered her face brightens --

CHARLOTTE
I could leave and come back

WILLS
Nope too late Anyway I want to
see the hat
He walks over to her Smiling she sets down the box
the ribbon and gingerly removes the hat Its
simple and elegant She looks at him with hope His

betrays nothing --

WILLS
Try it on

CHARLOTTE
I cant Im soaked

WILLS
Its all right

Charlotte a little confused carefully sets the hat on
head She steps to a wall mirror pulls the veil down
sets it at the correct angle

Wills appears behind her and shares the reflection She

his presence hears his breathing They speak in hushed

WILLS
Its perfect Its like a tiny
sculpture

CHARLOTTE

I wanted it to be a tiny poem
She smiles Their eyes meet in the glass

WILLS
If only I had some use for it

He gestures toward the half-open door on other side of

WILLS
Nonsense Youre very good Where

CHARLOTTE
From Ella The woman whose memorial
you crashed

WILLS
So you did see me there

CHARLOTTE
Uh-huh And the next time I saw you
you were on the cover of New York
magazine And I had to pick a place
for my birthday So
It takes a few beats for Wills to put it together He
realizing that her presence at Elysium wasnt a

ON THE PERIMETER FIND TWO RICH WOMEN 40s too thin
lifted watching Wills and Charlotte waltz
They stand with LISA 23 unassuming fair-haired
dressed
RICH WOMAN 1
Of course he moved back I mean

list actress in town What was left
for him

Pause Lisa looks at her feigning naivety

LISA

RICH WOMAN 1
But if what I hear is true and hes
shopping for a bride I can tell you
one thing -- hes barking up the
wrong tree there

LISA
Why do you say that

RICH WOMAN 1
(with an icy smile)
Good wives are rarely found up cherry
trees

The women share a laugh Lisa slightly discomposed
looks
back at Wills and Charlotte

INT GRAND BALLROOM -- LATER

Wills and Charlotte slow dance to a romantic ballad
Wills
seems entranced by her easy manner of expression --

CHARLOTTE

I met Ella in the fourth grade She
was my teacher at the Little Red
School House We stayed friends after
she retired She taught me how to
cook and sew speak Italian
basically enjoy life have fun --
thats what she was best at even
when she knew she was dying

(pause)
he most important thing she did was
ntroduce me to poetry She believed
t was the highest form of art and
hat everything we say and do should
aspire to it

Wills is uncomfortable for a moment then ventures
quietly --

WILLS
It sounds as though in a way she
took your moms place

CHARLOTTE
My mom and my dads After they died
Dolly was so devastated she pretty
much gave up on everything It was
ironic

laughs --

Charlotte

like if something that tragic could
happen there was no way she was

ever gonna care about anyone else

ever again Including herself She
wasnt a horrible parent she didnt
abuse me or anything she just
ignored me She was more like a weird
landlady than a grandmother

smiles sadly Her eyes glisten in the light

WILLS
Im sure she did the best she could

CHARLOTTE
For a long time I kinda thought that
too and I made excuses for her but
now I dont I was seven years old
and I needed her and she wasnt there

Silence as Wills somberly reflects Finally he speaks

Suddenly

change of

WILLS
I remember when I heard the news
about your parents You know how
after a crash they print a long list
of names in the newspaper Well I
grew up outside Boston so I naturally
started to scan the list But
casually not expecting to --

a SWING SONG starts Wills smiles at the
mood then turns to escort Charlotte away --

CHARLOTTE
Oh no come on I love this stuff
Dont you Didnt you grow up on it

WILLS
How old do you think I am

CHARLOTTE
Ancient

Holding his hand she starts moving to the music Wills

WILLS
I have no idea what to do

CHARLOTTE
Have fun

She flings her wrap onto a chair and keeps dancing
charmed senseless finally surrenders

A SEQUENCE BEGINS during which we see WILLS and
having an inordinately good time Wills maintains a

of reserve Charlotte is joyful and entirely

CERTAIN GUESTS NOTICE THEM The reactions to their
runs from confusion to disgust to amusement
But no one watches them more carefully than Lisa
Finally in the middle of a song Wills and Charlotte
their way off the floor winded and laughing Wills
off to the bar Charlotte turns around and watches the
dancers
Then we notice Lisa standing next to her They smile at
other Lisa offers her a cocktail napkin Charlotte
and wipes off her brow
They speak above the music --
LISA
I had to come I work at the Met
Whats your excuse

CHARLOTTE
Sort of a date

LISA

CHARLOTTE
You know him

LISA
Just by reputation
CHARLOTTE
A major womanizer right

LISA
Thats what they say
(beat)
Im Lisa
CHARLOTTE

Charlotte Fielding

They shake hands Lisa looks away and sees Wills making

his
way toward them with two glasses of punch
Coolly covering Lisa beats a hasty retreat --
LISA
Anyway I should keep mingling But
it was nice to meet you
CHARLOTTE
Same here
Lisa smiles politely and walks away
Wills walks up watching Lisa melt into the crowd His
brow
is furrowed Hes wondering if his eyes have deceived
him
He hands Charlotte a punch --
WILLS
Who was that
CHARLOTTE
Lisa something
The name hits home Wills is flustered but then he
covers

as best he can and lifts his glass --
WILLS
(lifting his glass)

Heres to --

CHARLOTTE
Us

Wills smiles slowly and they toast

INT WILLS LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
The room is empty Theres laughter in the distance
The

front door opens and shuts We hear Wills and
Charlotte

both a little tipsy advancing down the hall toward us

CHARLOTTE
God you talk like youre a hundred
and sixteen

WILLS
Thats usually how I feel But not
tonight Tonight I feel sixteen
just sixteen and three-quarters

Wills crosses to the bar and from a small refrigerator
pulls

out a BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE already sitting in an ice
bucket

WILLS
Champagne

CHARLOTTE
He asked nonchalantly

Wills laughs then opens the bottle as he picks up his
previous train of thought --

WILLS

You see Charlotte the way you know
youre getting older is that you
start to notice patterns People
start falling into types Pretty
soon you know a person before youve
even been introduced And if its a
woman before the romance even starts
a whisper in your head tells you
exactly what it is and how long its
going to last And the saddest the
most tedious part of all is that
that little voice is almost always
right

(popping the cork)
Now what I like about you -- and I
think thats actually what inspired
this little lecture -- is that I
find you completely unprecedented
and therefore wholly unpredictable
CHARLOTTE
God it must be a relief

WILLS
(confused)
What

CHARLOTTE
To finally deliver that speech to a
woman and actually have it apply to
her

WILLS
Now wait a minute

CHARLOTTE
No because coincidentally I am all
those things you just said And more

Wills chuckles shaking his head charmed but a little
unsettled

CHARLOTTE
Ima unique At least thats what
my yoga teacher says He says there
are very few uniques in the world
and Im one of them

WILLS
Well hes a wise man

He hands her a glass of champagne

CHARLOTTE
You on the other hand are what
hed call a typical

WILLS
Oh really

CHARLOTTE
Uh-huh And I can prove it Want me
to Come here

Wills moves a few steps closer

CHARLOTTE
Closer

Wills walks even closer until they are just a few feet
apart

DISSOLVE TO

CHARLOTTE
No come on really close

Wills cant believe his good luck He nears her until
faces are almost touching

CHARLOTTE
Perfect Now watch very carefully

She rises on tiptoe and puts her mouth just inches from

Their breathing mingles Wills seems almost dizzied by

And then very slowly he kisses her
She does not kiss back
Finally he pulls away staring blankly breathing
sure what to say
Charlotte whispers --
CHARLOTTE
See Youre a typical
(pause)
And for what you just did most girls
my age would slap your face Or ask
to be put in a cab
(pause)
Lucky for you Im a unique
She smiles then kisses him deeply on the mouth Her
wrap around his neck
INT WILLS BEDROOM -- NIGHT
Cloaked in deep shadow set off against a rainy window

we see Wills his shirt off on top of Charlotte whose

is open He passionately kisses her neck and mouth

INT WILLS BEDROOM -- MORNING
The room is bathed in golden light Charlotte lies

naked
under the covers asleep on her stomach Her brow is
tense
and one of her hands is slightly clenched
ANGLE ON WILLS standing in the doorway watching her
his
face a portrait of conflicted thoughts
Finally she stirs Smiling and squinting into the sun
she
gets up on one arm and looks at him standing there in
the
doorway --
CHARLOTTE
Boy do you look guilty
EXT WILLS TERRACE -- LATER
Charlotte happily wolfs down her continental breakfast
Wills
sits across from her watching and worrying
CHARLOTTE
Didnt anyone ever teach you that
its bad manners to stare at a girl
when shes eating like a pig
Wills chuckles then his smile fades and he clears his
throat
WILLS
Listen --
CHARLOTTE

Uh-oh Here it comes

WILLS
Thats right because look I could
put this off but I genuinely like
you So I want to be clear right
now from the start so theres no
chance for misunderstanding later

A suggestion of a smile plays along his features --

Wills stares at her blankly not knowing what to think

I could have put off telling you

Charlotte gulps down the juice Wills watches his mind
reeling

INT DOCTORS OFFICE -- DAY
Wills sits across from a large desk beneath a wall of
certificates and diplomas The door opens and DR PAUL

60 African-American dour and forbidding enters --
SIBLEY
Mr Keane Dr Sibley

Wills jerks to his feet and they shake hands --

WILLS
Thank you so much for taking the
time

SIBLEY

Its my job sir Please sit down

He walks around the desk Sibley is all business but
his
brusqueness masks genuine regret --

SIBLEY

Now Mr Keane on the phone you
referred to Charlottes condition as
cancer That isnt strictly accurate
Neuroblastoma is a soft tissue
malignancy but it isnt cancer --
although it sometimes can be just as
aggressive

(sitting)
Its most common in children In
young adults the condition is
extremely rare In Charlottes case
the tumor is located in her chest
Its growing rapidly and has proved
resistant to both irradiation and
chemotherapy And because of its
proximity to her aorta surgery is
out of the question

WILLS
So then what treatment is she getting

SIBLEY
At present Nothing

Wills shifts uneasily in his chair

SIBLEY
Eventually shell be treated for
pain In the end surgery could become
an option but her chances of survival
would be slim Right now Charlottes
against it Shes signed a directive

intervention

A silence settles between them Sibley opens a folder

Wills doesnt react He keeps walking toward her
she holds up the puzzle

CHARLOTTE
How are you on Cambodian money units

Wills keeps advancing

Slowly C

path of his own thoughts

harlotte steals a sidelong look at him His

hen and unreadable --

CHARLOTTE
Hey

Wills slowly turns his head She smiles sweetly --

CHARLOTTE

Look on the bright side if I werent
sick theres no way we could hang
out together

(off his look)
Im serious Youd be scared of
hurting me and Id be scared you
were just using me for my perfect
young body

He cant help but smile Encouraged she moves closer -

CHARLOTTE

And then our friends would say we
were just into each other for weird
psychological reasons You know
because Im looking for a daddy
substitute and youre looking for
someone you can feel superior to so
you wont have to confront how scared
you are of real intimacy -- and of
course theyd be right and eventually
wed break up

(beat)
But since Im so sick it doesnt
really matter what deep-seated
weirdness has brought us together
because theres no way we can possibly
screw each other over or up
because that takes time And I dont
have much left
The cab comes to a stop in front of her brownstone She

smiles
archly savoring the irony --
CHARLOTTE
So considering everything dont you
think we should just sort of chill
out forget Im sick and enjoy what
we have right now no strings
just this until it ends Cause
thats really all I have to offer
Wills grimly appreciates the irony
CHARLOTTE
Think about it okay But not too
hard
She kisses his cheek and jumps out of the cab She
skips up
the steps of the brownstone then immediately turns
around
and runs back down to the open window
She leans in and mutters sexily --
CHARLOTTE
Last night was so incredibly hot
(beat)
By the way -- it was my first time
And I picked you for the job I hope
youre flattered
Wills is shocked She turns and runs back upstairs She
sticks
in the key then turns and waves at Wills before
banging
open the door with her hip

credulity

CHARLOTTE
Really Better put some ice on that

Shannon lifts a hand to high-five her --

SHANNON
Girlfriend you are so incredibly
cool

water --

WILLS
Not much I took her home and she
pointed out an irony -- that fate
was now offering us the very same
thing that just this morning Id
told her was all I could offer her
a relationship with no future

JOHN
(chuckling)
A kid figured that out

WILLS
Shes not a kid Thats what Ive

But I do know what she was

John looks at him curiously Wills glances over his
shoulder
at the bussers then leans in close --

WILLS
A virgin

JOHN
What

The busboys turn their heads

WILLS
I had no idea Thats the only reason
she had her party here so she could
lure me into doing the honors

JOHN
I dont know when you talk about

stupid I like that

WILLS

JOHN
And since I dont see you gettin
serious with any of your other

At work you should look perfect but
in everyday life you need to delight

sweet disorder in the dress kindles
in clothes a wantonness
WILLS
think that goes without saying

t was true when that poem was written
three hundred years ago and its
true today Wouldnt it be fun to
look wanton occasionally

ts been a lifelong dream of mine
But will a scarf do it

Totally Accessories rule But we
have to be careful I dont want you

Wills holds his breath for a moment then exhales and
it --

Charlotte sets down her wine glass as she pieces it

CHARLOTTE
So I made the hat for myself

And you bought that dress for me

And you did all this just so you

Why I mean why me

Wills settles himself then meeting her eyes speaks

softly --

her death about loss in a way
that I could never have done You
understood life emotionally in a way
that I didnt Whatever that
understanding was I wanted to get

And sex seemed like the best way to
do it

Wills FOLLOWS HER agitated and curious

He sees her pass through a set of glass doors into the
Research Library

He hurries over to the doors just in time to see her

behind a bank of card catalogues
Wills notices a sign at the door that forbids entry to

public He hesitates then enters

He speaks to the first person he sees -- a ROTUND

LIBRARIAN IN HER 60S He stops and asks a question
Lisa She nods

Wills is shaken by the answer He stares into the
distance wondering what to do his mind racing

The librarian a little nervous now reminds him that
not allowed in the library He snaps to thanks her
moves away

But then he stops takes out a BUSINESS CARD and

the librarian He is about to hand it to her but then
thinks better of it

Flustered he thanks her again and exits The librarian
after him confused and a little apprehensive

INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE LIBRARY -- SAME

Wills sees Charlotte at the end of the hall looking
for him When she spots him her face brightens She

out facetiously as she walks to him --

CHARLOTTE

I got restless

Charlotte moves slowly through the darkness

CHARLOTTE
This

She yanks a cord by the window The BLIND OPENS and the
is flooded with MOONLIGHT The room is still dark but

is far more clearly visible

Her dress is unbuttoned down the front She walks back

him and stops about five feet away

She releases the last buttons on her dress then slides
off her shoulders to the floor She wears only her

She crosses her arms over her breasts and smiles --

CHARLOTTE
Have I told you my latest motto

WILLS
No

CHARLOTTE
If its scary do it

WILLS
Im not sure I like that motto

CHARLOTTE
Im not sure that matters

She closes her eyes takes a deep breath then slips

She stands before him entirely naked

Her self-consciousness is excruciating but she is

to endure it Finally she opens her eyes and smiles

Wills eyes widen as he takes her in He crosses to her
lays his hands on her hips He kisses her neck

As their breathing quickens she begins to unbutton his
and pull it free of his pants

He takes hold of her hands stopping her and starts to

her toward the bed She resists Wills falters and she
realizes something

CHARLOTTE
Oh my God

WILLS
What

CHARLOTTE

Youre scared too
From his expression she knows she is right

CHARLOTTE
Your turn

For the first time since weve met him Wills is

a loss But he sees that Charlotte has no intention of
down

He begins to undress His hands are uncertain as he

his shirt and unbuckles his belt When he is finished
undressing he turns to face her his arms at his side

Although we cannot see him in the moonlight and
Charlotte can She looks down at his naked body and
it He stares back with shy wariness
Then she breaks into a crooked grin --

Laughing he grabs her wrists and throws her on the

INT WILLS BEDROOM -- LATER

Wills and Charlotte make love As their passion builds
Charlotte is suddenly stabbed with a pain in her chest

She grabs his back her face twists She holds her

not wanting to reveal the incident to Wills She closes
eyes and exhales as the pain subsides

INT WILLS BEDROOM -- LATER

Wills and Charlotte lie in bed with the blinds open and
city glimmering in the distance

Charlottes head rests on his chest Eyes closed he

his hand along her face as though he were a blind man
committing every detail to memory

Charlottes voice almost inaudible drifts up through
dark --

CHARLOTTE
Counting the beats
Counting the slow heart beats
The bleeding to death of time
In slow heart beats
Wakeful they lie

Wills half-asleep murmurs deeply --

So many words in that wonderful head

He slams down the phone His face is beet red Wills
up calmly from his paper --

WILLS
Are you familiar with the phrase
You can catch more flies with honey
than with vinegar

JOHN
Are you familiar with the phrase
Mind your own god damn business

WILLS
Sure its from Poor Richards

JOHN
No your business is to smile make

friends and get rich My business

John heads out then stops abruptly and looks back His
tone

is suddenly calm and curious --

John looks at him strangely with a hint of suspicion -

JOHN

No seriously Why not

Wills has no answer

John moves closer when Celia his
new

assistant enters cheerily --

CELIA

She tosses him a paper bag he catches it

No trouble

CELIA

Wills removes a PAIR OF RED PLASTIC HORNS John shakes
his

head with disbelief

JOHN

He holds the horns up to his forehead

She exits As Wills sips the drink he sits on the
sofa and continues to glance through his mail
Suddenly shocked he stops on a letter He sets his
down He hears Charlotte making noise in the next room
opens the letter and begins to read
His eyes dart down the page but he quickly sees that
letter is not friendly His face shows disappointment
He hears footsteps in the hall He folds the letter up

it back into its envelope and jams it in his back
Charlotte enters and throws her hands out to her side -

She stands before him dressed in a WHITE SPINSTERLY

She sees Wills standing there Watching the kids his

noticed at the toy store --

She gives him an affectionate poke in the stomach as
passes by and disappears upstairs

Finally the boy grabs the apple in his teeth and lifts
soaked head to the cheers of his friends

Then he grabs it out of his mouth and begins taking big
out of it until he uncovers a SILVER DOLLAR

Wills laughs at the kids excitement A moment later a

Shit

She gets to the end of the hall and is about to give
up
When she hears FOOTSTEPS
She walks around the corner and sees a NARROW STAIRCASE
leading to the third floor

At the dark at the top of the stairs Wills and Wendy
appear
Charlotte smiles --

CHARLOTTE
You lost your horns

Hey looking for me

CHARLOTTE
Uh-huh

We were checking out the roof Johns
got quite a set-up

They arrive at the bottom of the stairs

WILLS

Charlotte -- my friend Wendy Lister

They smile and shake hands Charlotte looks at them
both
carefully for any sign of uneasiness There is none

WENDY
Actually I saw you at that memorial
service in Connecticut Your eulogy

EXT BROOKLYN BRIDGE -- NIGHT

mirror

A TOWN CAR speeds toward Manhattan
INT TOWN CAR -- SAME

Wills and Charlotte stare straight ahead each lost in
thought The lights of the city illuminate their faces

eerie flashes
Finally Wills glances over and smiles --

WILLS
I have a strange feeling that youre
upset with me

CHARLOTTE
No I was just wondering if you had
sex with that woman

WILLS
Ever

CHARLOTTE
No the answer to thats pretty
obvious I meant tonight On the
roof

Wills breaks into a grin --

WILLS
Youre not serious

Wills laughs to himself then glances up and sees the
reflection of the drivers amused eyes in the rearview

Wills smiles back at Charlotte --

WILLS
Of course not Why would I want to
do something like that

CHARLOTTE
Thats what I was wondering I
thought Were so happy hed have
no reason to do it And if he did do
it hed at least look guilty
wouldnt he But he doesnt He looks
more relaxed than before the party
started

WILLS
Well there you have it
CHARLOTTE
But then I thought Hes a womanizer --
thats what they say Funny word
huh Sounds like some sorta machine
And how do you get to be a womanizer
Obviously by sleeping with lots of
different women for no good reason
and being really good at lying about
it

WILLS
Sure except that --

CHARLOTTE
Let me finish

Again Wills looks up at the drivers eyes in the
mirror
They seem more serious now

CHARLOTTE
Anyway theres something about being
sick right here --

She touches her own chest Her voice trembles slightly

CHARLOTTE
-- that has made me acutely aware of
my heart Nothing corny -- I mean
literally I feel every beat I
know how sensitive it is It reacts
to everything

She turns in her seat and lifts an OPEN PALM

CHARLOTTE
If youre lying to me Ill know it
(beat)
Did you have sex with Wendy on the
roof

He smiles at her as though he were indulging a child
She

looks him deeply in the eye and opens a button of his
shirt

She slips her palm inside over his heart

Still smiling he doesnt move a muscle
her

hands and

an

outward

voice

his

lights

Their eyes are locked

Ever so slowly her face crumples and tears appear in

eyes She shakes her head --

CHARLOTTE
My God oh my God

She slides away from him drops her face into her

begins to cry Wills looks down then glances up at
rearview mirror

the

Illuminated in flashes the drivers eyes have taken on

ominous unblinking quality as though they were the
embodiment of his own conscience
Wills looks out the window When he finally speaks
is calm and a little cold --

other than --

eyes small and frightened

This was all a mistake Right from

man and youre a child

Anyway you have better things to do
with your last -- With your time
than spend it with me

CHARLOTTE
(distantly)
What about you Do you have anything
better

Wills has no answer Charlotte slowly gets out of the
car
She leans back in her eyes narrow with disdain --

CHARLOTTE
You know maybe youre right Maybe
this is the best time to end it
Because I was actually starting to
love you Wills and thats the last
thing I ever wanted

She shuts the door

As Charlotte enters we hear Wills cab pull away She
moves

to the stairs and sees a LIGHT shining beneath the
living

room door

INT BROWNSTONE LIVING ROOM -- SAME
Dolores sits watching an old movie her eyes dulled by

cataract of boozy fatigue The door opens She looks up
and
sees Charlotte in costume

Well if it aint the Belle of

Charlotte smiles feebly and plops down on the cracked
leather

ottoman She looks blankly at the TV She sniffles and
wipes

a hand across her nose Dolores glances over then back
at

the set

DOLLY
Seen that face before
it

Charlotte

CHARLOTTE
You have

DOLLY
And for the same god damn reason

is confused but then puts it together --

CHARLOTTE
But you said Wills and my Mom were
just friends

DOLLY
Sure but she was nuts about him
The only reason she didnt sleep
with him is cause she was
sentimental And smart She wanted a
ring first

CHARLOTTE
Why didnt he give her one

DOLLY
Cause he knocked up little Millie
Tyler instead In Newport At Baileys
Beach During the Labor Day clam
bake

She chuckles grimly coughs and sips her drink

DOLLY
Millie was your moms best friend
from Nightingale You had to hand it
to him He sure knew how to make a
point

She coughs again Charlotte struggles to make sense of

all

CHARLOTTE
Why did he do that

DOLLY

Aw who the hell knows Cause the
moon was full Cause lifes short
Cause hes Wills Keane Ill tell
you a little secret -- after that
your Mom hated his guts but your
dad never made her smile like he
did

(pause)
Course your dad never made her cry
like that either

CHARLOTTE
(softly)
Why didnt you tell me any of this
before
DOLLY
Oh I dunno
CHARLOTTE
You never talk to me You never try

to help me
Dolores eyes grow nervous She swallows hard

DOLLY
Christ look at me Im gonna tell
you what to do

CHARLOTTE
Yes Youre my family Youre supposed
to take care of me

DOLLY
Aw you wouldnt listen Thats the
thing about people -- they just do

what they want from the day theyre
born till the day they die

She realizes her poor choice of words She looks over
and
their eyes collide Charlotte begins to cry --

CHARLOTTE
No thats you Dolly People who
have given up dont listen to other
people People who want to die close
off Thats not me I wanted your
help I wanted to learn

blankly He disappears into the bedroom

INT WILLS BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Wills enters and sees some of Charlottes clothes
neatly on the bed A LITERARY ANTHOLOGY lies open
DRAWING OF EMILY DICKINSON

He grabs the clothes and the book and puts them in a
BAG that she has left on the floor

Then he walks into the bathroom We see him gathering
PRODUCTS off the sink He walks back in and sets them
the shopping bag

He looks around and spots a nearly completed crossword
sitting folded on the dresser He drops that in the
bag too then sets it by the door

He feels a draft and spots an OPEN WINDOW As he

it he notices something on his pillow A blank

picks it up and rips it open

Its a HALLOWEEN CARD of a grinning JACK-O-LANTERN He
it and inside is handwritten

The scariest night of the year and only one thing

that we might never have met

Somebody always gets left behind
You try to avoid that youll end up
an old man toastin yourself with

Wills lifts his frightened eyes John pats him on the
cheek

EXT HIGH-RISE APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT

Wills stands with Patty in the driveway in front of the
glass

lobby He is distracted and terribly anxious She looks
as

though she expects at the very least a kiss --

PATTY
Thank you so much I had such a great
time

WILLS

Good Im Im glad

PATTY
Didnt you

WILLS
Patty I I want to be honest with
you right now from the start
so theres no room for
misunderstanding I didnt have a
good time but its nothing personal
I just split up with someone and
rather than admit to myself how much
I miss her I asked you out instead
And its unfair If I feel sad I
should just feel sad and not try to

use you and your body as some
sort of painkiller right
(beat)

Anyway I think youre a warm and
engaging woman and I wish you all
the best

Relieved to have unburdened himself of the truth he
shakes

her hand Patty utterly baffled doesnt know what hit
her

EXT WILLS BUILDING -- LATER

The doorman Michael smoking a cigarette sees Wills
walk
up his expression pensive

MICHAEL
Mr Keane --

WILLS
Good night Michael

MICHAEL
Youve got a visitor

Wills stops and turns --

MICHAEL
Shes been waitin almost an hour
In the lobby
(off Wills look)
A little surprise for ya

He winks Wills realizes that its Charlotte It must
be He
smiles and hurries inside
INT WILLS LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS

Wills bursts in and freezes A WOMAN stands across the

way

studying an oil painting She turns quickly Its LISA
She

sees his excited expression fall Beneath her rather
composed

facade Lisa is a chaos of conflicting emotions --

LISA
Sorry to disappoint you

WILLS
No no Not at all You surprised
me thats all I didnt expect to
see you not here not after
your letter

LISA
Well I didnt expect you to show up
at my job

WILLS

I followed you in I wasnt even
sure it was you All I have is an
old snapshot

LISA
My boss thought you were a stalker

WILLS
I didnt mean to run off like that

LISA
But you did

An awkward silence

LISA
So you got my letter Whatd you do
Freak out Burn it

WILLS
I saved it

LISA
I was just blowing off some steam
okay I think I have the right

WILLS
So do I Look why dont we go

LISA
(uneasily)
No I didnt plan to come Peter
my husband he agrees He thinks

its a futile exercise But it turns
out Im pregnant Just a few months

but --

WILLS
Lisa -- Congratulations Thats

His sincerity stops her She softens slightly
mustering a
tiny smile --

LISA
Thanks Anyway I guess it made me
want to meet you Ive been a little
sentimental about parent-hood

WILLS
Is that what you consider me

LISA
In a lousy absentee sorta way sure

Pause

WILLS
Hows your mom

LISA
Great Nuts She moved to Costa Rica
last summer

WILLS
Why

LISA
A guy what else He owns a charter
airline and wears sunglasses indoors
I think he might be a gunrunner

Wills chuckles For the first time Lisa relaxes enough
to
take him in

LISA
You know youre much better looking
in person than in photographs I
always assumed Mom was exaggerating
but she wasnt

WILLS
Thanks Youre not bad looking
yourself

Lisa smiles and much to her embarrassment tears come
to

her eyes She shakes her head at how absurd she is
treasuring

kind words from a father she doesnt know

LISA
Anyway I should go

WILLS
Already
LISA
I really just wanted to meet you
and maybe I dont know
WILLS
(gently)

What is it Tell me
She sniffles and looks away --

LISA
Nothing earth-shattering Maybe just
to hear you say you were sorry

Silence

WILLS
I am Im very sorry

She stares at him long and hard waiting for some more

palpable sign of remorse It isnt forthcoming
Finally she

nods

LISA
Okay Thanks

She turns and walks away His voice stops her --

As she reaches the landing she feels a STABBING PAIN
CHEST and stops walking Wincing she waits for the
subside

INT CHARLOTTES BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Charlotte enters wearily drops her purse on the floor

turns and GASPS
Wills lies sprawled in an armchair fully dressed sound
asleep

Charlotte is offended by the intrusion She hurries

over to
awaken him But then she stops Her face softens
slightly
She studies his face touches his cheek with the back
of
her hand traces the lines at his eyes with a
fingertip
smooths back a wisp of hair
Finally snapping to steeling herself she jostles him
CHARLOTTE
Hey
Wills wakes with a violent start When he sees her he
drops
his head back He closes his eyes again and murmurs
sleepily --
WILLS
Where were you I was worried
CHARLOTTE
So worried you fell asleep Whatre
you doing here
WILLS
Ive missed you You have no idea
how much
She crosses coldly to her closet and half-shutting the
door

blocking his view starts to undress

CHARLOTTE
Howd you get in

He sits up rubbing his eyes in the morning light

WILLS
Dolly We watched TV She fell asleep
What time is it

CHARLOTTE
I didnt know I had a curfew
and

relenting

she

WILLS
Where were you

CHARLOTTE
None of your business So what is
it What do you want

Wills sits forward more alert now He exhales heavily
begins

WILLS
To tell you that you were right I
do hate myself But not so much that
I cant see how stupid and despicable
and --

CHARLOTTE
Cowardly

WILLS
And cowardly what I did was And
even though theres no excuse for
it I want you to forgive me

She turns and looks at him She feels herself
She
turns away and continues undressing --

CHARLOTTE
Why should I

WILLS
Because for better or worse Im
falling in love with you and the
thought of our not being together is
unbearable to me

She stops then glances at him with a flash of pain and
longing Determined not to surrender to her feelings

crosses to the bed and throws open the covers

CHARLOTTE
Lets sleep

She crawls into bed
CHARLOTTE

In the morning well talk about
what a gigantic asshole you are
Wills relieved crosses to the bed and begins to
undress
He asks casually --

WILLS
So where were you

CHARLOTTE
With Shannon and Simon and Eric

WILLS
Whos Eric

CHARLOTTE
An old friend who used to work at
Blockbuster

WILLS
Whatd you guys do

CHARLOTTE
Talked and drank Simon and Shannon
finally went home Eric and I hung
out

Thinking nothing of it Wills nods He slips into bed
Her

back is to him He drapes an arm around her and pulls
her a

little closer

He smiles contentedly and closes his eyes But then
something
occurs to him He opens his eyes --

WILLS
Hung out where

CHARLOTTE
Stop Well talk about it tomorrow

WILLS
Fine

He closes his eyes again A few beats later they open
WILLS
Talk about what Is there something
to talk about What happened

Charlotte eyes still closed breaks into a sly amused
smile
brisk

tries

EXT CENTRAL PARK WEST -- DAY
Wills and Charlotte collars turned up against the
wind walk together Charlotte wears a backpack Wills

desperately to appear casual --

WILLS
No honestly I think I have a right
to know

CHARLOTTE

And I honestly think I have a right
not to tell you

WILLS
Youre being unreasonable

CHARLOTTE
Youre being nosy

EXT CENTRAL PARK -- DAY

They move down a winding walkway beneath barren trees -

WILLS
You know in this day and age its
not so outrageous a request I mean
I dont know this kid I dont know
where hes been

CHARLOTTE
(laughing incredulously)
Youre worried about where hes been
Give me a break

nearby --

WILLS
All I want is a simple answer and
youre torturing me And I resent
it Its cruel and juvenile And I --

CHARLOTTE

(exploding)
HEY

Her anger startles him She skates over quickly and
an abrupt stop --
CHARLOTTE
Its not Its adult Its revenge
And if you think its bad not knowing
what I did -- well its even worse
knowing exactly what you did
She turns and skates away

EXT WOLLMAN RINK -- AFTERNOON

Wills sits on the bleachers miserably brooding while
Charlotte gracefully glides by laughing and chatting

THREE YOUNG MALE SKATERS whom shes just met

EXT CENTRAL PARK -- NIGHTFALL
They walk together in silence Wills is sullen
Finally
Charlotte takes his hand and speaks gently but firmly -

CHARLOTTE
Do me a favor okay Never ask me
again what happened with Eric Just
accept the fact that youll never
ever know And if that hurts then
think about it next time you want to
cheat on somebody

Wills reflects
INT WILLS BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Charlotte and Wills are little more than silhouettes
lying
entwined in the rich darkness conversing in whispers

WILLS
I wish I were exaggerating but Im
not I slept with every one of them
Really Look through Dollys old
photo albums or any movie
magazine visit Aspen at Christmas
I was on a mission And until recently
I really didnt think I had a problem
Or if I did it was definitely the
most pleasurable one I could imagine

CHARLOTTE
What changed

WILLS
My house in Malibu burned to the
ground

Charlotte laughs Wills smiles with sad irony

WILLS
I know it sounds funny But it must
have triggered something because the
next thing I knew I couldnt sleep
Id lie awake at night absolutely
terrified Like a kid left alone in
the dark

CHARLOTTE
What were you scared of
WILLS

How quickly time was passing and how
adolescent I still felt How
meaningless all my choices seemed
How lonely I was So I liquidated my
portfolio sold my businesses and
moved back here To start over settle
down start acting my age

(beat)
You were supposed to be my one last
dalliance with youth

CHARLOTTE
Well for your sake I hope I am

He thinks for a moment then smiles and kisses her
brow

doorway

INT TELEMETRY FLOOR CORRIDOR -- NIGHT
Sibley walks Wills down the hallway --

SIBLEY
The repeat MRI and CAT scan do show
interval progression

WILLS
(uncertainly)
Which means the tumors grown

SIBLEY
Yes Yes it has Considerably As
for her loss of consciousness one
explanation is a disturbance in her
hearts electrical function Well
be monitoring her overnight for any
arrhythmias If we find something
well treat it Unfortunately the
more likely explanation is that the
tumor has begun to obstruct the
outflow of her heart If thats the
case theres little we can do We
could be speaking in terms of weeks
not months

They arrive at Charlottes room

SIBLEY
When she returns home well want
her to stay active but dont let
her overexert herself

(off Wills nod)
Dont stay long Shes been sedated

INT CHARLOTTES HOSPITAL ROOM -- SAME

Charlotte lies in the bed with her eyes closed An EKG
monitor

bleeps steadily in the corner An IV drip hangs by her
bed

Wills enters and sits down at her bedside He touches
her

hand She opens her eyes and smiles drowsily --

CHARLOTTE
Hey
Wills is terribly anxious His speech is accelerated

WILLS
Are you all right Youre okay How
do you feel

CHARLOTTE
Stoned

WILLS
Ill let you rest I should Youll
sleep and then --

CHARLOTTE

(touching his hand)
Shhh

He nods and inhales deeply His heart is racing She

murmurs --
CHARLOTTE
You still owe me a birthday present
WILLS
I do not
CHARLOTTE
Just cause I fainted is no excuse
for you to bail on your peacock pose
She smiles sleepily Wills lifts a hand to her mouth
and

whispers

WILLS
It ought to be illegal

CHARLOTTE
What

WILLS
Your smile Its too pretty

CHARLOTTE
Ive ruined you for other women

WILLS
You have

CHARLOTTE
All part of my master plan

(beat)
Do you wanna hear a story a bedtime
story

WILLS
Shouldnt I be telling you one

CHARLOTTE

Once upon a time there was a woman
on a ship crossing the Atlantic and
her little boy got sick Very sick
And she said whoever saves my boys
life Ill name my next baby after
them Well they got into port and
they rushed her son to St Vincents
hospital to here and they saved
his life And so the mother named
her next baby Edna St Vincent Millay

(beat)
And Edna grew up to be as I am sure
you know the second greatest female
poet in American history

WILLS
The first would be Emily Dickinson

CHARLOTTE

Youre a quick learner -- I like
that about you

(half to herself)
It may be when my heart is dull
Having attained its girth
I shall not find so beautiful
The meagre shapes of earth
Nor linger in the rain to mark
The small of tansy through the dark

Her eyes drift shut --

CHARLOTTE
I am so pretentious

Wills laughs then clears his throat and looks
suddenly
serious --

WILLS
Charlotte listen I --

CHARLOTTE
Uh-oh Heavy heavy
WILLS
I just think --

CHARLOTTE
No No violins Im fine Go home

sleep

He considers for a moment then tears welling in his

eyes
he lifts her hand to his mouth and kisses it
INT BROWNSTONE LIVING ROOM -- AFTERNOON
Wills sits across from Simon who strokes Shannons back
as
she weeps --
SHANNON
It just didnt seem real and now
that it is I hate it Its so unfair
Dolores sitting in her armchair mutters as though by
rote --

DOLLY
Fare is what you pay on the train to
Jersey Fair is the place that smells
like manure where if youre real
lucky you win a blue ribbon for
your home-made pickles Fair is a
sky without a cloud and a face with
a mark Fare is food What fair isnt
is everything else

SIMON
Well I think I speak for all of us
when I say that weve heard quite
enough from Dolores

Dolores chuckles Simon continues to Wills --

SIMON
Now correct me if Im wrong but I
believe what youre saying is that
while the end may be in sight it
has not yet arrived

WILLS
Thats right The tumors begun to
interfere with the function of her
heart but she --
contempt

SIMON
Then why exactly have you called us
here

Wills falters looking at him incredulously

SIMON
I cut short a lunch date Shannons
missing her low-impact aerobics class
and Dolores has delayed the start of
her happy hour -- surely you must
have had good reason

WILLS
I thought Charlottes health might
be of some interest you

SIMON
It is You could have told me all
about it on the telephone

WILLS
I also thought it might be a good
idea if we discussed ways to make
her as comfortable as possible for
the --

SIMON
Charlotte loathes comfortable I
never sought to bore her with comfort
while she was well why should I
start now that shes sick

Wills stares at Simon his face ashen and full of

Pause

WILLS
Tell me are you really so cold Or
is it just a pose that youve
cultivated

SIMON
Its a pose that Ive cultivated
(beat)
I chose it as a sort of smoke screen
some time after attending my twentieth
funeral in as many months

WILLS
Im sorry

SIMON

Its quite all right But honestly
it shocks me how often you people
forget Our phone books have as many
numbers crossed out as written in
So that while death is certainly as
painful to us as it is to you we do
not find it nearly so
extraordinary

(beat)
Dont misunderstand me I adore
Charlotte and when she dies I
would were it not already in that
state cry my heart dry

Shannon looks at Simon and burst into tears again

Simon

holds her even closer rubbing her back

carriage past

Wills and Charlotte walk together bundled up again the
Charlotte walks backward her breath shooting out into
cold air like smoke --
CHARLOTTE
You never talk about my mother

(beat)
Talk about her
WILLS
What do you want to know

CHARLOTTE

Everything All I remember is that
she smelled like vanilla loved to
read to me and was really good at
cutting up fruit I couldnt believe
she didnt cut her fingers off

WILLS
Well I remember a little more than
that Lets see she was blonde

about your height --

CHARLOTTE
Ive seen pictures dummy

WILLS
Oh okay She always ate her ice
cream with a fork -- hows that
CHARLOTTE
Much better
WILLS

And she wrote great letters but
couldnt spell at all

CHARLOTTE
Neither can I

WILLS
She was a McGovern Democrat but also
an incredible snob She loved
blueberries She had the worlds
worst backhand Her favorite singer
was Stephen Stills

CHARLOTTE
Who

WILLS
Never mind She was afraid of sharks
And considering the times she was
pretty square She only tried drugs

once -- a lifeguard gave her a hash
brownie and she threw it up all over
him

Charlotte laughs
WILLS
And she laughed just like that And
she bit her fingernails And she
couldnt tell a joke

In short she was a unique

Charlotte smiles happily

Wills and Charlotte lean down on the railing watching

the
water purl and eddy around Randalls Island

CHARLOTTE
Did you know she was in love with
you

WILLS
She told me

CHARLOTTE

Were you in love with her

WILLS
Yes

CHARLOTTE
Why Because she was the only girl
in Rhode Island who wouldnt sleep
with you

WILLS

Thats how she got my attention
its not why I fell in love with
her

(beat)
I fell in love with her because she
charmed me senseless day and night
for an entire summer

CHARLOTTE
Then why did you screw her best friend
on Labor Day

Wills looks at her darkly She smiles and shrugs --

CHARLOTTE
Its just a question

Wills sighs and looks away reflecting --
WILLS

I have no idea The summer was over
Your mom was going back to Smith I
was moving down here to work on Wall
Street It was our last day together
She was crying She told me for the
first time that she loved me I
said I loved her too I promised to
call and visit A few hours later I
was in a cabana with Millie

(beat)
When Millie told me she was pregnant
and that she wanted to marry me I
escaped to LA and I never saw
her or your mom again

CHARLOTTE
(wryly)
Well done

WILLS
I think its part of the reason I
never came back

CHARLOTTE
But whyre you like that What is
it I mean you werent born that
way

WILLS
I might as well have been For as
long as I can remember Ive always
run off at the first sign of a woman
wanting anything from me relying
on me in any way

She considers for a moment --

CHARLOTTE
But I want everything from you Wills
I rely on you in every way

WILLS
I know

So the only reason you dont dump me
is because Im sick Because you
know that its all going to be over
anyway

and whispers with passionate sincerity --

WILLS
I love you Charlotte

For an instant her eyes flare as though she were

Then her eyes fill with tears She tries to speak but
choked by a sob

She buries her face in his chest and cries Wills

with warm almost paternal indulgence He strokes her

She hugs him as though shell never let go

INT GRANDYS OFFICE -- SAME

tumors can regress like crazy but

fashioned transplant But it doesnt

restaurant But the rents are too
high

He smiles at her And she smiles back

INT WILLS BEDROOM -- MORNING

Charlotte lies asleep with her head on his chest She
opens

her eyes The room seems strange Its the light

She rises up and turns around Her eyes narrow with
curiosity

She crawls out of bed and runs to the window and looks
out

She cant believe her eyes Central Park is blanketed
by

deep snow and more is falling She calls out gaily --

CHARLOTTE
Hey How do you feel about Christmas

WILLS
(sleepily)
Bah humbug

She runs back laughing and jumps on the bed rousting

MUSIC UP

A SEQUENCE BEGINS showing Charlotte and Wills during a
of holiday shopping The deep snow has slowed the city
crawl but filled everyone with good spirits

Charlotte and Wills move from store to store they buy
wreaths garlands ornaments candles and finally a
CHRISTMAS TREE and STAND

Wills starts to lug the tree but when its obvious

its too much for him Charlotte spots a GROUP OF KIDS
spilling out of a record store

The next thing we know the kids are lined up carrying
tree over their heads like a battalion of ants
Wills and the kids load the tree into the freight
and squeeze in Theres no room for Charlotte Shell
the lobby elevator
MUSIC OUT
INT LOBBY ELEVATOR -- AFTERNOON
Charlotte carrying shopping bags ascends in silence
Michael She has no interest in chatting He as ever
MICHAEL

away for the holidays

CHARLOTTE
I doubt it

MICHAEL
Ive seen so little of America I
dont care for airplanes you see
and I have so little time to travel
(beat)
Did Mister Keane enjoy his trip then

CHARLOTTE
What trip

MICHAEL
Why just yesterday

CHARLOTTE
I wouldnt really call that a trip

MICHAEL
Perhaps not But Ive never been to

Charlotte goes pale The elevator stops and he opens

the
door
INT WILLS FOYER -- CONTINUOUS
Charlotte steps out right into the kids who are
roughhousing
and laughing Each holds a five-dollar bill --
MICHAEL
(calling out)

INT WILLS LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
Charlotte wanders in The tree stands erect Wills on
all
fours tightens the screws on the stand He crawls to
his

feet and studies it

WILLS
Straight

Then he sees her grave expression and freezes

CHARLOTTE
I thought we had a deal

WILLS

CHARLOTTE

You were in Ohio yesterday

bedroom

Wills stares at her for a moment then explains
apology --

WILLS
I met with a heart specialist Hes
willing to operate

For an instant she is surprised but then her

takes over --

CHARLOTTE
But you know I dont want that You
know Ive signed papers that --

WILLS
Well maybe I want it

CHARLOTTE
It isnt your decision

WILLS
Of course not but if youll hear me
out --

CHARLOTTE
No I told you right from the start
how I felt and you went behind my
back You lied and --

WILLS

(exploding)
Oh Christ knock it off Youre
such a god damn saint so above it
all but youre scared to death You
do want to live And if you were as
honest as you say you are youd let
the doctors do whatever they can to
help you

Her face shuts like a trap She walks toward the

door --

CHARLOTTE
I wont give people hope when there
isnt any

WILLS
Why not Maybe we want hope Or
maybe we just need to know that we
did everything we could Maybe I

without
need to know that if Im going to
be able to live to go on without
without --

Suddenly a sob catches in his throat Charlotte on

her way
to the bedroom stops and slowly turns around
She speaks matter-of-factly without judgment or
feeling
CHARLOTTE
Now I know why you hurt so many women
Because you always knew if you held
on to one of them youd never let
go
She turns and exits coldly to the bedroom Wills sinks
into
an armchair
INT WILLS BEDROOM -- LATER
In grey afternoon shadows Charlotte lies on her side
fully
clothed under the covers with her eyes open thinking
She
hears something and looks back
Wills stands in the lighted doorway
She gestures for him to come He walks over and lies
down
next to her She turns her back to him so that hes
spooning

her but she takes hold of his hand pressing it
against her
chest and squeezing it like a doll

For a long time they lie in silence Finally she
murmurs
almost inaudibly --

CHARLOTTE
When we met I was so lonely But I
didnt even know it Id been alone
so long almost forever

WILLS
So had I

CHARLOTTE
But now we have each other
(beginning to cry)

Oh what would I do Wills What

would I do if you werent here Where

would I be

Fighting his emotions determined to stay strong for
her he
holds her close

WILLS
You dont ever have to worry about
that

CHARLOTTE
Ill do whatever I have to Ill
tear up the papers Whatever you
want Tell the doctor Because I
really do want I dont want to
leave you

The dam breaks and she is wracked by sobs Wills closes
his

eyes holds her even tighter and rocks her in his
arms

DISSOLVE TO
INT WILLS BEDROOM -- THAT EVENING

Charlotte still fully clothed lies sound asleep She

slowly
awakens and sees that Wills is gone She gets up on one
elbow --

head

with suspicion

He looks into the room and freezes in the doorway He
up a step then crying out lunges into the room

half to himself --

WILLS
Time cannot break the birds wing

Can die as others do

Charlottes eyes open dreamily She shows a faint smile
the poem and murmurs almost inaudibly --

Dolores crushes out her cigarette her expression

Celia touches Johns back as he rises and walks over to

Simons face turns to stone
John reaches for Wills but Wills advances a few steps

decisive move YANKS OFF HIS SURGICAL MASK and THROWS IT
AGAINST THE WALL

CLOSE ON WILLS FACE as he realizes

His mouth opens wide as though to cry out but no sound
