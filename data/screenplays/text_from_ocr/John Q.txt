EXT TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY

Mancinis Ave Maria fills the screen as a white BMW speeds along the
road

CREDITS ROLL

A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN is behind the wheel We never see her face Hanging
from the mirror is a rosary with a crucifix Her porcelain hand turns
up the volume and the music swells A silver bracelet dangles from her
wrist

EXT TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

A slow-moving semi obstructs her path The woman leans out the window
to see if the road is clear before moving into the oncoming lane She
steps on the gas Shes in the wrong lane and cant get over There
are headlights in the distance and the moan of an airhorn is heard

EXT TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS
Suddenly the headlights are upon her And airhorn blasts and shes
trapped between two monstrous big rigs She cuts the wheel hard but
too late The oncoming truck clips her sending her car end over end

SLO-MO

The accident is violent and horrible The BMW cartwheels along the
highway in a grotesque ballet of destruction The music crescendos and
sparks fly as the car skids along the pavement on its roof And as the
BMW violently smashes headfirst into the embankment the beautiful
woman is slammed into the windshield like a crash-test dummy

Ah Mr and Mrs Archibald Rebecca Payne hospital director This is
Doctor Turner head of our cardiology department

JQ

Hows our boy doing
PAYNE

Please sit down

John and Denise sit and the lights are dimmed Dr Turner approaches
an illuminated display of X-rays He uses a pointer to clarify

DR TURNER

This X-ray is that of a normal nine year old heart This one is your
sons

John Q and Denise stare nervously at the fleshy fist-sized organs on
the translucent glass

DR TURNER (CONTD)

There are septal defects here here and here which have induced a
myopathy resulting pulmonary edema and malignant ventricular ectopy
As you can see Mikes heart is approximately three times normal size

He points to Mikes heart huge in comparison

JQ

Im sorry I dont understand Could you pout that in laymans terms

DR TURNER

Of course Basically theres not enough blood being pumped by the
heart so it backs up in the lungs Sort of like a sponge getting wet
Mikes heart is trying but Im afraid its working too hard
JQ

So whats he need An operation

Turner gathers himself takes off his glasses

DR TURNER

Im afraid were considerably beyond the point of corrective surgery
Mr and Mrs Archibald Your sons heart is useless He is going to
need a transplant

The room goes silent

DENISE

Hes nine

PAYNE

Wait a second There are other options

JQ

What options

PAYNE

To do nothing Medicate him Keep him as comfortable as possible You
need to start thinking about quality of life now

DENISE
I dont understand We were just with him He seemed fine

DR TURNER

Hes going to seem fine But as his heart gets worse he will become
increasingly fatigued need more and more sleep until one day hell
go to sleep and he wont wake up

PAYNE

I know its difficult but you must face the fact that your son may
not have much time left You might want to make it a happy time Say
goodbye

DENISE

Oh my God

PAYNE

And transplantation is a high risk operation You could lose your son
on the table You may not want to take that chance

JQ

What do you think Dr Turner

DR TURNER

This isnt my decision

JQ

I know that Im asking for your opinion Without surgery how long
does he have
DR TURNER

Not long Months Weeks Days

This is too much for Denise She breaks into tears John puts his arms
around her steadies her gathers his thoughts

JQ

What would you do if it was your son

PAYNE

Mr Archibald

JQ

Not you Him

DR TURNER

Id do the transplant Absolutely

JQ looks at Denise who nods

JQ

Okay Lets do it

DR TURNER
The first step is to get Mikes name on an organ recipient list Once
he does his chances are very good Your sons an extremely rare type
so theres less demand With B-positive blood Mike could go to the
top of the list right away

PAYNE

Its not that simple There are other considerations before a
prospective recipient is placed on the donor list Mr Archibald The
cost of transplant surgery is expensive In most cases prohibitively
so

JQ

Ive got major medical Dont worry Im covered

PAYNE

Actually weve already checked with your carrier Theres no
provision in your policy for a procedure of this magnitude

JQ

There must be some kind of mistake My son is covered Ive got full
medical Hes covered

PAYNE

What about you Mrs Archibald Do you have coverage

DENISE

No Ive only been working at the market a short time You need to be
there two years before you get benefits
Payne flips through the Archibald family file

PAYNE

I see that you dont own your own home No investments stocks bonds
And you have a little over one thousand in savings

JQ

Did you hear what I said Im telling you Im insured

PAYNE

That may very well be but youll have to check with your carrier on
that In the meantime Im afraid were going to have to treat you as
a cash account

DENISE

How much does a transplant cost

PAYNE

Transplant surgery doctor fees post operative treatment and
immunosuppressant drugs youre looking at two-hundred and fifty-
thousand dollars minimum

JQ

What are you saying If I dont come up with a quarter million dollars
youre not going to treat my son

PAYNE
We have treated him We continue to treat him Now I understand how
upset you are sir But with other options available we are not
obligated to cover a procedure this costly If you opt for replacement
surgery thats your choice But the hospital maintains a very strict
policy with respect to cash patients We require a down payment before
the patients name can be placed on the receiver list

DENISE

What kind of down payment

PAYNE

Thirty percent Seventy-five thousand

JQ Seventy-five thousand dollars to put my kids name on a list

DENISE

Our son is upstairs dying and all you can talk about is money

PAYNE

Yes it takes money to provide health service Its expensive for you
and for us My job is to keep this program alive For everyone Now

the country

Never mind me Youre worthless You know that Some security guard
You should have zapped the bastard

SECURITY GUARD

With what Besides Im not putting my neck on the line Not for
eight-fifty an hour

drawer steals a sharp-edged scalpel slips it into his pocket Next

NT EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

The vending machines have been jimmied open and a huge pile of candy
bars and soda cans sit on the waiting room table Everybody is chowing
down

JQ

The thing I dont understand is why no one caught it before Mike had
check ups every year since the day he was born Why didnt his doctors
pick it up

DR TURNER

Was he ever diagnosed with a murmur

JQ

Yeah he was About a week after he was born But his doctor said that
was normal That it happens all the time

DR TURNER

He might not have been tested thoroughly enough

JQ

Why not

MAGUIRE
You got an HMO right Theres your answer HMOs pay their doctors
not to test Their way of keeping costs down Lets say Mike needed
additional testing insurance says they wont cover them The doctor
keeps his mouth shut and no ones the wiser Little Mike falls through
the cracks and come Christmas the HMO sends the doc a big fat bonus
check JQ looks at Turner

JQ

Is that true

DR TURNER

Possible Not likely but possible

JQ

Then Mikes doctors could have known about his condition all along
And he could have been treated years ago

DR TURNER

Who knows

LESTER

Nothing personal Doc but you all are a bunch of damn crooks

MAGUIRE

You seeheres the problem Over here youve got your insurance
companies who basically want you healthy or dead Thats how they make
money And over here youve got your medical establishment doctors
pharmaceutical companies who dont want you healthy or dead They
want you sick Thats the way they make money
LESTER

Its all about getting paid man

MAGUIRE

And the individual is caught in the middle of this gigantic tug-of-
war Its a game And the end result is people dont get the
treatment they deserve

LESTER

Because then no one gets paid

JULIE

But what about that thing you guys take That promise What do they
call it

STEVE

recovers his weapon sticking it in his waistband Julie stands over
Mitch who is still writhing in pain

watching helplessly as the life drains out of his body

JQ

How are you feeling slugger

DR TURNER

Out

JQ

What

DR TURNER

I need some time to examine Mike and I dont need you getting in the
way Its crowded enough in here

JQ

Ill stay in the corner

DR TURNER

Turner ushers him out the door and closes it behind him John looks up
to find the hostages staring at him Uncomfortable he moves into a
recovery room

INT EMERGENCY ROOM - TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT

JQ alone notices the simple wooden cross hanging over the door He
stares at it a long time before kneeling his arms resting on the bed

JQ
Bless me father For I have sinned Its been a long time so forgive

me if Ima little rusty I know you do things your own way But Im
finding it hard to understand why you would want Mike to be so sick

INT MIKES TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT

Turner administers the meds and Mikes eyes glaze and roll back in his
head With all the drugs coursing through his system Mike is really
out of it now But as Dr Turner diligently attends to Mike the boy
considers him the bright OR lights casting a halo around the
doctors head

MIKE

Are you God

DR TURNER

(caught off-guard)
Yeah kid Yeah I am

Turner continues working and as he turns his back to the boy he
hears the question that floors him

MIKE

Where you been

INT EMERGENCY ROOM - TRAUMA ROOM - NIGHT

JQ

I keep waiting for you to step in and help him But you never do And
I dont understand I dont understand and I dont forgive So help
me Father Because Im trying Im really trying

Dr Turner appears at the doorway and sees John on his knees

DR TURNER

John

JQ looks up and Dr Turner soberly shakes his head The news isnt
good

INT EMERGENCY ROOM - TREATMENT AREA - NIGHT

Dr Turner and John look through the glass at Mike resting peacefully
DR TURNER

Mikes blood pressure has dropped into the mid-forties His atrial
blood pressure should be in the low teens Its thirty-five If I put
that LVAD into him his heart will never be able to handle the extra
strain

JQ

But

DR TURNER

Not buts John Without a new heart hes not going to make it

JQ is devastated It takes a few moments to sink in

JQ

Take mine

Turner doesnt get it

DR TURNER

What

JQ

You heard me Take my heart and put it in Mike

MITCH
John buddy youre talking a little nutsy cukoo here

DR TURNER

You cant be serious

JQ

You think Im just going to stand here and watch my son die You bet
Im serious Dead serious

DEBBY

Wow

JULIE

Oh my God

Lester tries to comprehend the nihilistic existentialism of it all

LESTER

But that means youll die man

JQ calmly finishes Lesters thought

JQ

And my sone will live
DR KLEIN

John you cant do this

JQ

Its the only way

DR KLEIN

No you dont understand You physically cant do it

JQ

Why not I kill myself You cut me open and take my heart Its
perfect

LESTER

The boy crazy

MITCH

Nutsy cuckoo Im telling you

DR KLEIN

We just cant remove your heart and put it into Mikes body

DR TURNER

Theres too many unknowns Matching a donor and receiver is extremely
complicated Theres several critical tests that have to be taken
JQ

Like what

DR TURNER

Cross matches for blood type chest cavity measurements If both blood
tissues arent compatible theres a very high likelihood of
rejection

JQ

Come on Doc I know all about compatibility Weve been tested up the
wazoo Mike and I are both B-Positive Our tissues are a match And
his heart is three times normal size which means mine will fit You
know damn well were compatible

DR TURNER

No we dont Youre an adult Mike is strong but the amount of blood
your heart pumps may be too much for Mike

JQ

Ill take that chance Its better than letting him die

DR TURNER

Out of the question Too risky

JQ

Im telling you hell make it

DR TURNER
Cant do it John

JQ

Youre telling me that if Im laying dead on the floor you wouldnt
take my heart and put it in my kid to save his life Youd let two
people die instead of one because of a technicality

JULIE

I think what Johns trying to do is right

DEBBY

Me too I think its very brave

MAGUIRE

Yeah its all very noble and brave But what do you think Mike would
want Or your wife

JQ

Mike is too young to know whats good for him Im his father Its my
job to protect him and Denise would do the same thing if she was in
my place

SECURITY GUARD

Are you saying Mikes life is more important than yours

MITCH

Or that its okay that Mike grows up without a father
MAGUIRE

You can have more children John

LESTER

What happened to Mike is bad man Its the worst It aint fair but
you cant kill yourself Sometimes youve just got to let go and let
God take care of it Youve got to accept it

JQ

Accept what

DR TURNER

That Mikes going to die

JQ

No I dont accept it I reject it out of hand

John moves over to Dr Turner to plea his case

JQ (CONTD)

I know you only think of Mike as a patient but hes a great kid
Really Hes like magic you know He loves bodybuilding You believe
that And hes funny Youd like him Doc Youd really like him if
you knew him
DR TURNER

I do like him

JQ

Please Youve got to help him Im begging you If you ever do
anything outside the rules do this Take a chance please

DR TURNER

Id like to I really would But what youre asking crosses the line
Its completely unethical

JQ

Ive crossed the line No youve crossed the line The whole system
has crossed the line

JQ paces around the room his hand on his weapon his mood very dark
and threatening

JQ (CONTD)

I dont think you understand Im not letting him die Havent you
figured that out by now I dont care what I have to do

DR TURNER

So what youre going to kill me if I dont operate

JQ

No Im going to kill myself
JQ puts the gun to his temple

JQ (CONTD)

And well just see what happens

LESTER

Aw man this is messed up

JQ

We all know how this works people In order for Mike to live someone
has to die Im the father It might as well be me

JQ and Turners eyes meet Turner doesnt speak for a long moment

DR TURNER

Alright

MITCH

Alright what

DR TURNER

Ill do it If thats what you want

MITCH
Wait a minute Are you serious

The room goes quiet

DR TURNER

Once hes dead Why not

Dr Klein moves to Dr Turner

DR KLEIN

Youre the finest surgeon Ive ever known You cant just throw your
entire career for this man

MITCH

Yeah youre not God Its not up to you to decide who lives and dies

JQ

Aw come on Mitch Were all going to die

MAGUIRE

Not for nothing Doctor But if you do this youre finished

DR TURNER

So what are they going to do Sue me Disbar me Evict me from the
country club
DR KLEIN

Raymond youre under a lot of stress Youre not yourself

DR TURNER

Yeah well what is myself Because right now I really dont know

I run six miles a day drive around in my little black Porsche and
date girls thirty years younger than me Is the picture clear now I

very short glimpse of my soul And let me tell you its been long
