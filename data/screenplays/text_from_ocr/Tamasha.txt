Grand Opera

Lights in the auditorium fading down The curtain on the stage is being
lifted revealing a grand theatre stage

Frontstage is a robotic figure walking on a treadmill Behind him is a
joker sitting on a rock with back to us fishing

Silence for a moment then there is a small beep sound and then -
Robot Kabhi kabhi mere dil mein khayaal aata hai
Joker Itni zor se aata hai ki pant mein hi ho jaata hai

Audience response Robot turns sharply to the joker turns back

Robot Kabhi kabhi mere dil mein khayaal aata hai
Joker To phir dimagh mein kya aata hai (turns) Bolo Bolo bolo
Robot Shut up Quiet Silence

Kabhi kabhi mere dil mein khayaal aata hai
(quick) Main kaun hoon

Joker (stands) Vo to mujhe pata Yes yes
Tu vohi hai jo subah ko office jaata hai aur sham Ko ghar aata hai
Jo boss ki daant khaata hai ha ha ha par kisi ko nahin batata hai
Bayalis seat ki bus mein jo ek sau bayalis log chadhte hain unmein
se ek tu hi to hai

Robot Warning - Audience aa chuki hai
Joker (sings) Aap andar se kuch baahar se kuch aur nazar aate hain

As this is going on in the front-stage lights begin to come on in the
backstage Many sections in the set come into view each having a different
setting and characters It looks like various stories playing out simultaneously on
stage

Ram Sita and some characters from the Ramayan Laila and Majnu an
autorickshaw and its driver Helen of Troy a ten year old school boy at Report
Card Day at school and a few others Meanwhile with the joker and robot -
Robot Get out Get out Sho

Joker Achcha
Robot Go go
Joker Arey tere hote main kaise go (coy) Apna to taanka hai na Janam

janam ka atoot bandhan jeena marna tere sang do badan ek jaan
Robot SOS SOS Charlie come in Charlie Security

Joker (turns to audience) Henh henh henh Maaf kar do bechaare ko
Dil ka achcha hai ye - aap hi ki tarah Magar kya karein dil aur
duniya ke beech kahin phans gaya hai - aap hi tarah Karna bahot
kuch chahta hai par haalat se maar khaata hai -

The joker extends her hand to the audience meaning ‘Aap hi ki tarah’

Joker Kintu parantu but magar Main hoon na yes main hoon iske
dil ki aawaaz

The Joker shows a finger then touches it to the Robot’s heart
Joker Ting

The heart begins to throb The robot gets worked up and speaks in
agitation -

Robot Dil to paagal hai
Thoda kachcha hai ji
Sheesha ho ya dil ho
Dil cheez kya hai
Dil Dil Dil

Joker Maana ki dil hai beqaraar
Is sey khatre hain hazaar
Par aise machine ki tarah jeena - nonsense bekaar
The joker shows a palm then touches it to the robot’s heart
Joker Tong
The heart begins to throb faster The set begins to capsize things fall
lights fuse sparks fly The robot becomes more damaged and speaks with

greater agitation in the background -

Robot Disruptive technology A B theeta beeta gaama zaalim lotion
paanch sau pachchattar methods fester organic growth measure
success square root 747 to the power n by the impact on Lado
Sarai Malkagunj King Kong Teriyaki Mon Amor

Meanwhile the joker comes closer to the audience and speaks -

Joker To audience yaar aisa hai
Isne ye tamasha banaya hai tumhaare liye Dil se banaya hai to
pasand aaye to taali vaali baja dena yaar hain
Aur koi bhool-chook ho jaaye to maaf karna theek hai
Na na iski chinta mat karna mujhe iske saare button pata hain
jhat se theek ho jayega ye mast tamasha dikhayega haan
To araam se baithe ho Shuroo karein

Then the joker picks up a funny hammer
Joker Ready steady

The joker runs and hits the robot’s heart with the hammer
Joker Dharraaang

A massive short circuit happens on the set The robot begins to break
down completely Sparks fly in all directions siren sounds are heard Things fall
All lights go off When the chaos subsides there is only one section of the
background that is lit and active

It is the set of the report card day in school A teacher is heard
complaining about the student boy to his father as the boy stands with his head

down in shame

Song 2

Don and Mona step away looking at each other He begins to sway with
the music she follows suit a relief sets over them She spins they begin to dance
Music changes colour the parade begins to move in the direction of Don and
Mona He begins to dance more and more intensely begins local desi dancing
She laughs dances along tries to ape him He makes the dance bigger and bigger
And more desi style He begins to sing Nonsense lyrics People notice fascinated
He sings and dances with conviction

He and she move around Then they move into the parade
He climbs on a make-shift stage and sings She dances People cheer They
do the full out desi dance

In the middle of it somewhere he swiftly transforms to Dev Anand - and
begins to do to music what Dev Anand does She laughs He sings like Dev Anand
now No one else can see the point of what he is doing but he does it with full
conviction

Later he moves around the vivacious atmosphere hung on to Mona like a
coat piling on to other people on the way and prancing in and out of places with

the hands’ swagger as Dev Anand would do He is Dev Anand

Storyteller ek faqta ud kar saamne ped par baith jaata hai magar
doosre faaqte ko Laila jaane nahin deti usey apni chhati se
laga leti hai aur jaise jaise faaqte ke dil ki dhadhkan badhti
hai Laila de dil ki dhadhkan bhi badh jaati hai Laila bhi us

hi aag mein jal rahi hai

Laila in the boy’s imagination standing at her window with a fake dove
Qaes watches from below as Laila is seen at the window high above

The boy continues the storyteller’s tale to his granny at bedtime -
Boy aur phir Laila female chidiya ko chhod deti hai aur vo
phhurr se ud kar male chidiya se milne chali jaati hai aur
Laila bhi Majnu se milna chahti hai

Dado Kyon

He looks at her suspiciously she keeps her face straight

Boy Aapko nahin pata

Dado (innocent) Nahin

Boy Tch Usko pyaar hai na Majnu se
Dado Oh

Boy Haan Pyaar

Opera music On the grand stage - Laila high at her window releases a
dove She looks at the dove as it flies away to the tree Qaes on the lower level
across the boundary wall with his horse watches her This spectacle is clearly
inspired from images of Ved’s early imagination Also seen in the background is
Juliet in her balcony and Romeo looking at her from the ground below -
mirroring Laila and Qaes

Do saal mein hazaar tution lene ke bawajood tum kisi bhi
engineering college ka entrance pass nahin kar paaye Apna ek saal
ghar baithe waste kiya tumne Ab donation de kar tumhaara
daakhila ek engineering college mein ho raha hai tumhein
shukriya ada karna chahiye sharm ke maare double mehnat karni
chahiye Aur interest hai kahan tumhaara Ped ke neeche baith

Allahabad In full glory full style He is living his dream in this performance

Flashback Ved walks up the corridor after the talk with his father He
enters Granny’s room and shuts the door He makes huge silent scream of
frustration Again But then he stops himself controls himself He stands in the
room trying to relax himself He looks at himself in the mirror

Flashback The autorickshawala sings on stage He is enjoying the
performance and his style

Flashback The house in Simla

Ved in the house another day ready to leave for the engineering college
He is standing at the terrace looking at the town that he is leaving His travel bag
in on his shoulder

Ved walks up to the car with his bag turns to looks back His granny
mother and some others are standing in the porch The trees where he has
imagined scenes from the Ramayan play out are seen in the distance He waves
goodbye to that life

Back in the present time The autorickshawala is singing the song without
music at a typical all night paratha corner Ved is sitting on the pavement stone

into the song -

Ved Phir kya hua

Hona kya hai
Vohi kahaani phir ek baar -

Majnu ne liye kapde phaad maar tamasha beech bajaar
Ruk ke socha - Aisa kyon
Aisa waisa jaisa taisa paisa

Paisa
Paisa na hota to phir kaisa hota

Socho

Arey chhodo boring baatein saali

Mast raho aur jam ke khao

Le lo pange chadh lo sooli

Phaad lo kapde khol do bandhan ghol do lassi bol do kissa
Sabhi janon ka dil behlao

Shor machao

Maaro thumka

People sitting around at the paratha stall have begun to notice Ved
continues -

Ved Phenk-bikhero man ki chandi
Dil ka sona aankh ke moti
Sab arpit hai
Aap ki khaatir
Main naukar hoon aapka maalik
Tie pehen kar lift mein chadh kar phir aaoonga aapke aangan
Vohi karoonga jo roz kiya hai
Vo phir se karoonga phir se karoonga phir se karoonga

Achcha beta
Kabhi udhar to kabhi idhar

Ved is clutching the socialite as Chadda and a few other try to wrestle
him out They finally manage to force Ved to let go and the socialite hurries away

saying -

Socialite He’s mad He’s mad He assaulted me He is dangerous I tell
you He can’t be walking around like this

playing They are performing with great flair and happiness

The diamond ring is strung on a black thread Ved is standing in front of

Song 7 (Part Two)

We enter the fourth grade classroom and reach the boy when he had got
his examination paper result He is looking down trying to control his tears

Then he turns and looks into the camera his face changes - a naughty
smile breaks out and he reveals the paper aeroplane that he has made with the
examination paper Then he gets up and flies the plane away and runs out of the
classroom as his teacher and classmates look at him in surprise

Music builds up The boy runs down a corridor Then turns and runs out
to the school ground where school boys are doing physical training The boy runs
across the PT formations this way and that disturbing the exercise He runs out
of the formation as other kids turn and look losing interest in their excercise
The boy is laughing

The school gate opens and Ved in the twelfth standard strides out and
tosses his examination sheets above his head The papers fly in the air

Ved in his engineering hostel gets up and yanks his writing desk to the
ceiling He is abusing wildly

He comes out of the room into the corridor screaming loud abuses He
runs up screaming abusing as the others look at him

He dances across a classroom where students are being taught some
complicated mathematical concept All students turn and look at him wondering

Ved climbs the table in the conference hall at his official presentation He
dances crazily as the boss Mohit the clients and others watch in disbelief

Majnu dances in the wild alone

Majnu dances on the grand musical stage

The dance of madness in the theatre play that the robot presents to the
audience Ram Sita Raavan and Hanuman dance wildly on the grand musical
stage The autorickshawala dances Prithviraj dances everyone dances

Apart from the characters of the play now we also see dancers joining in
the dance

The robot emerges on stage The dancers swarm to him and surround
him They begin to swirl around him as he remains frozen They snatch at the
robot’s costume and tear out a piece at a time in the dance and when finally the
whirlwind of dancers leaves we see that the robot has transformed into Ved An
announcement is heard - “Ladies and Gentlemen presenting the story-teller -
Ved Vardhan Sahni”

Audience applause Ved stands in front of the audience The entire cast of
the play is in a freeze Then Ved walks up front stage The applause roars Ved is
looking different from before Seven years have passed since he met Tara at the
corporate seminar in Japan Ved comes to the front bows to the audience

Massive cheer and clapping Standing ovation
Ved looks up then to the side On that side of the audience is Tara
standing next to the door and clapping He suddenly moves towards her ina
cheap filmy manner throwing many air kisses at her Tara also moves up ina
similar manner throwing air kisses at him More cheer and laughter and
clapping Ved looks at Tara for a moment then bows to her More applause and
cheering from the audience Ved looks at Tara Tara is overwhelmed Then Ved
goes down on his knees to Tara in gratitude Tara is embarrassed is indicating to
him to stop it Ved does not stop he prostates on the stage to her Tara gets
emotional tears rush to her eyes Massive cheer Ved looks up at Tara She moves
to him He clambers towards her in all fours She reaches out they look at each
other They kiss The audience and the players on stage cheer wildly They are
with each other in the crowd then she runs away Leaving him alone in all fours
exposed in front of the crod He gets up smiling looking away from the audience
Then extends his arms like an aeroplane like he would do as a child and flies to
this place in the center of the cast of the play He covers his face momentarily
then takes the hands of the cast and they all raise their hands to the audience and
bow Curtain falls The cast bows
