Saul Steinberg

A light goes on in Baltimore

A light goes on in Seattle
They are the only lights on the map

INT LIVING ROOM - LATER

Walter is sitting on the couch as Cliff shows him slides

of cloud formations in Guatemala In the next room

Toms at the piano and the kids are singing Christmas

carols

INT BACK STAIRWAY - SIMULTANEOUS

MAX one of the children is teaching Uncle Milton to

burp

INT ATTIC - NIGHT

The sound of Christmas carols from below
The attic is full of boxes and Annie walks through with

her mother

sheet over

antique dress

They come to a dressmakers dummy with a

it Barbara removes the sheet

BARBARA
The Historical Society wanted
this and I never would give it

to them --

ANNIE

Grannys dress Oh Mom

BARBARA
I notice these things are back
in fashion Oh honey
(tears are rolling down
her face as she tries
the veil on Annie)

Hes a lovely man Annie

ANNIE
I know Hes wonderful isnt

he

A beautiful

A veil sitting on top of the dummy
BARBARA

Are his folks nice

ANNIE
Youll love them Were going
down to DC tonight to be with

them Christmas morning

BARBARA

How did it happen

Barbara starts to unbutton the tiny buttons on the back

of the dress and remove it from the dummy

ANNIE
Its silly really I mean
Id seen him at the office
obviously Id seen him hes
the associate publisher and
then one day we both ordered
sandwiches from the same place
and he got my lettuce and
tomato sandwich on whole wheat
which of course he was allergic
to and I got his lettuce and

tomato on white
BARBARA
(utterly without irony)

How amazing

ANNIE
It is isnt it You make
millions of decisions that mean
nothing and then one day you
decide to order takeout and it

changes your life

BARBARA

Destiny takes a hand

ANNIE
Oh please Destinys just
something weve invented
because we cant stand the fact
that everything that happens is

accidental

BARBARA
Then how do you explain that
you both ordered exactly the

same sandwich except for the
bread How many people in this
world like lettuce and tomato
without something else like

tuna

ANNIE
It wasnt a sign It was a

coincidence

Barbara shrugs slips the dress off the dummy and Annie

steps into it

Barbra starts to button the dress on Annie

BARBARA
I was in Atlantic City with my
family Cliff was a waiter
He talked me into sneaking out
for a midnight walk on the
Steel Pier Ive probably told
you this a million times but
I dont care And then he held
my hand I was scared All
sorts of thing were going
through my head But after a

while I forgot about them At
one point I looked down at our
hands and I couldnt tell
which fingers were mine and

which were his And I knew

ANNIE
(hearing it for the

first time)

What
BARBARA
You know
ANNIE
(she doesnt know but
she doesnt want her
mother to know she
doesnt know)
What

BARBARA

Magic It was magic

ANNIE
(repeating)

Magic
BARBARA

I knew we would be together
forever and that everything
would be wonderful just the
way you feel about Walter
Walter Its quite a formal
name isnt it

(lowering her voice)
One of the things I truly knew
was that your father and I were
going to have a wonderful time

in the sack I believe you

call it --

ANNIE

Mom

BARBARA
Of course it took several years
before everything worked like
clockwork in that department
so dont be worried if it takes

a while --

ANNIE
Mom we already

BARBARA
Well fine fine Fiddle da

dee And hows it working

ANNIE

Like clockwork

She turns to look in the mirror The dress doesnt fit

at all

Its completely lopsided One shoulder is

higher than the other The waist is in the wrong spot

The effect is quite comical

EXT

BARBARA
So youll get married in a new

dress

ANNIE

Its a sign

INT HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

Jonah is smiling too

DR MARCIA FIELDSTONE (V0O)

under a cloud

JONAH
Tell her how you dont sleep at

night

SAM

How do you know that

Sam and Jonah both talk into their extensions literally
talking to each other on the phone within their own

house but also ON THE AIR

SAM

I dont think I have to now

Sam starts across the room towards Jonah who starts
toward him both of them holding their phone receivers

On the wall in the dining area is a pine bench

SAM
Look its almost Christmas --
(as the two of them sit
down together on the
bench)

A kid needs a mother --

houseboat Sam and Jonah are still on the bench but
Jonah has fallen asleep in Sams lap Sam is stroking

the boys hair

DR MARCIA FIELDSTONE (VO)

SAM

describe it

DR MARCIA FIELDSTONE (VO)

Why not
SAM

show

(he laughs to himself)
But what the hell Its not
one specific thing Its more
of a feeling

(continued)

Annie coasts to a stop outside a handsome mansion in
Washington DC the motor running Shes hooked now
shes not getting out of the car until shes heard it

all

SAM

time and suddenly youre
home Its almost like

SHES CRYING

DR MARCIA FIELDSTONE (VO)

searches for the button Finally finds it so that

Walter can open the door

ANNIE
Im sorry Walter I just

the radio

They start toward the front door Walter and Annie

carrying presents an overnight bag of Annies

ANNIE
People call up these shows and
you cant believe the stuff
they say Its the end of
privacy as we know it this
country is just one big global

village with everyone out there

As they enter the house we hear Silent Night and we see

a Christmas tree glittering with lights

cut To

A CHRISTMAS TREE GLITTERING WITH LIGHTS

as we pull back to reveal

INT HOUSEBOAT - EARLY MORNING

As Jonah opens his presents under the tree and we cut

from gift to gift

A BROOKS ROBINSON BASEBALL GLOVE which Jonah loves and

which he puts on his hand and keeps on while continuing

to open

A TIE which mystifies him but he hangs it around his

neck

A PLAID SHIRT

A MAP OF THE UNITED STATES -- the kind thats used in
schoolrooms that pulls down from a roller

And now Sam brings out a long narrow present from behind

the door and Jonah opens --

A NEW FISHING ROD

EXT BALTIMORE SUN - MORNING

INT LIFESTYLE SECTION - DAY

A large open newsroom-type space with REPORTERS at
computers Around the perimeter are glass-partitioned
offices and meeting rooms Inside one of the offices is
BECKY the Lifestyle editor of the Sun Shes at a
table with Annie now a reporter for the section and

two other colleagues -- KEITH and WYATT Wyatt is
playing Gameboy

KEITH

This man sells the greatest
soup youve ever eaten theres
a line around the block and he
is I am not kidding the meanest
man in America

(beat)
I feel strongly about this
Becky This is not just about

soup

BECKY

Do it What else

WYATT
New Years Eve Please dont

make me write it

Becky looks at Wyatt notices the Gameboy

BECKY
Wyatt I do not mean to remind
you of your mother but if you

dont put that game away no TV
for a week

WYATT
(pushing it to the
center of the table)
Would someone look this up

dont tell me where

Becky is riffling through some papers on the table
among which are some tearsheets from the Associated

Press wire

BECKY
Listen to this Phone service
in the greater Chicago area was
tied up for two hours Christmas
Eve because some kid called a
phone-in show to get a wife for
his father Two thousand women

called in for the number

KEITH

Jesus

ANNIE

I heard it This kid calls up
and says my dad needs a wife
and Im talking to myself in
the car saying this is
completely disgusting youre
taking advantage of a child
and then the father gets on and
this shrinkette says do you
want to talk about it And he
says no as a matter of fact I
dont and I am saying bravo
Right on Dont talk to her
its none of her business --

(shes completely into

this story now)

-- and then suddenly for no
reason at all hes talking

about how much he loved his

wife and how he just --

(she snaps her fingers)
fell in love with her and I am
crying Me A tear is
actually rolling down my face
It was like what happens when I
watch those phone company ads
I dont have to see the whole

ad I just have to see the part
where the daughter gives her
mother a refrigerator with a
big red bow on it have you

seen that one

Everyone looks at her Apparently shes finished

BECKY
You should write something

about this

ANNIE

About what

BECKY

Whatever it is

KEITH
(waving the AP story)
What it is is there are a lot
of desperate women out there

looking for love

WYATT

Especially over a certain age
Annie is looking at them This isnt what she was
talking about at all although she isnt quite sure what

she was talking about

KEITH
It is easier to be killed by a
terrorist after the age of 40

than it is to get married --

ANNIE
That is not true That

statistic is not true

BECKY
Its not true but it feels

true

ANNIE
Theres practically a whole
book about how that statistic

is not true --

WYATT

Calm down You brought it up --

ANNIE
(sharply)

I did not Wyatt

A beat everyone pauses Things are a little out of

hand

BECKY

So where were we

WYATT
New Years Eve Ill do it

okay

BECKY

Okay

ANNIE
If someone is a widower why do
they say he was widowed Why

ET MARINA PARKING AREA - DAY

Sam gets out of his car and starts down the dock toward

his houseboat Hes carrying a bag of groceries

In the parking lot is a US MAIL TRUCK

EXT HOUSEBOAT - DAY

Sam approaches his boat and a puzzled look comes over

his face

A MAILMAN with a sack of mail is standing outside the
front door of the houseboat Jonah is signing a receipt

for the mail
JONAH
Look at this Dad Theyre

all for you --

Sam picks up an envelop and looks at it Its
addressed to Sleepless in Seattle co Dr Marcia
Fieldstone Radio Station KWRS in Chicago Hes

stunned As he signs the receipt

MAILMAN
If youre having trouble
sleeping you might want to try
drinking a glass of water from

the other side

JONAH

I thought that was for hiccups

MAILMAN

Does it work for hiccups

JONAH
For hiccups a spoonful of
sugar you hold it in your

mouth for a minute
MAILMAN

Really

The mailman starts back toward the mail truck

Sam and Jonah start toward the door

INT HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

Sam is in the kitchen making dinner Jonah is sitting
at the table reading the letters from the stack they

found by the door

SAM
Just out of curiosity how did

they get our address

JONAH
They called and asked for it
(reading)
Dear Sleepless in Seattle
You are the most attractive man

Ive ever laid ears on

Jonah rolls his eyes tosses the letter into a pile of

rejects opens another
SAM
How did they get our phone

number

JONAH
You have to give them your
phone number or they wont let

you go on the air

Sam nods as if this makes perfect sense

JONAH
(continues reading)
Dear Sleepless in Seattle I
am an SWE--
(to Sam)

What is that

SAM
Thank God Something you dont
know Its a single white

female

JONAH

This is no good Shes looking
for someone French Or Greek
(puzzled he throws the
letter into the reject
pile opens another)

Dear Sleepless in Seattle I

live in Tulsa Where is that

SAM
Oklahoma Do you know where

that is

JONAH

Somewhere in the middle

SAM

Im not going to think about
what theyre not teaching you
in school I am not going to
think about it

(beat)
Generally speaking I think we
should rule out people who

dont live somewhere near here
JONAH

Shes willing to fly anywhere

As Jonah hands Sam the picture

SAM
She looks like my third grade
teacher I hated my third
grade teacher Hold it Wait
a minute She is my third

grade teacher

JONAH
Dad youre not taking this

seriously

SAM
This is not how you do it
(referring to the
hamburger)
You want this on an English

muffin or a bun

JONAH
English muffin How do you do

it
SAM
You see someone you like you
get a feeling about them you
ask them if they want to have a

drink or --

JONAH

-- a slice of pizza --

SAM

But not dinner necessarily on
the first date because by the
time youre halfway through
dinner you might be sorry you
asked them to dinner whereas if
its just a drink if you like
them you can always ask them
for dinner but if you dont you
can go home if you see what I
mean

(beat)
I wonder if it still works this

way

JONAH
It doesnt They ask you

SAM

Im starting to notice that

down

Past a sign saying Seattle Approximately 3000 miles

Past another sign Your nerves are shot
And another Your feet are cold

And another Will you find love

And another Before youre cold

And another Burma Shave

And Annie continues to run and now we see shes running
across a map of the United States -- its a little like
the one we saw in the beginning of the movie -- its
like the famous map of the United States by Saul
Steinberg but instead of being about New York this one

is about Seattle

In the distance at the very edge of the map we see two

indistinct figures -- a map and a young boy They start

to wave at her very slowly

I really do Are you happily

married

TOM
(completely panicked by
the question)

What

ANNIE
I mean why did you get
married Was it all fireworks

and trumpets and --

TOM
(regaining composure)
I got married because Betsy
said we had to break up or get

married So we get married

ANNIE

But when you met her did you
believe she was the only person
for you That in some mystical

cosmic way it was fated

TOM
Annie when you meet someone
and youre attracted to them
it just means that your
subconscious is attracted to
their subconscious
subconsciously So what we
think of as chemistry is just
two neuroses knowing that they

are a perfect match

ANNIE
I dont even know him But
Im having all these fantasies
about a man Ive never met

who lives in Seattle

TOM
It rains nine months of the

year in Seattle

ANNIE
I know I know I do not want
to move to Seattle But what I
really dont want to do is end
up always wondering what might
have happened and knowing I
could have done something
What do you think
(Tom opens his mouth to
say something but
before anything comes
out Annie fills the
void)
Its just cold feet isnt it
Everyone panics before they get

married didnt you

TOM

Yes I did

Thank you Tom I feel so much
better just having blown this

off

of paper litter the table Annies been unsuccessfully

typing a letter on an old Underwood typewriter

ANNIE
Now those were the days when

people knew how to be in love

She takes a blast from the wine glass to her right

Becky leans in refilling the glass Annie begins to
type and sob and look at the TV

(as she types)
They knew it Time distance
nothing could separate them

Because they knew It was

It sounds like the name of a

mattress store --

ANNIE
IT am not the sort of person
who listens to call-in radio

shows --

Becky flops on the couch

BECKY
And this woman is a writer
Thats what everyone writes at
the beginning of letters to

strangers

ANNIE
I know that You think I dont
know that I know thats a
dumb way to begin but its the
only way I can think of to
convey what happened to me the
other night when I heard the

two of you on the radio On

the other hand maybe Im just

losing my mind
BECKY
You are Youre losing your

mind What about Walter

ANNIE
Im going to marry Walter I

She types in Beckys idea

Then she takes the piece of paper out of the typewriter

smashes it into a ball and tosses it up in the air and

into Beckys lap
BECKY

You want to hear about destiny
If my husband hadnt gone on a
diet which caused me to leave
him I would never have been on
that flight to Miami and met
Rick and ended up having sex
in the bathroom of a 727 with
that nob you slide that says
vacant-occupied vacant-
occupied vacant-occupied --

(she shudders in

ecstasy then pulls

herself together)

ANNIE
You never told me you left your

there
ANNIE

Thats impossible A guy cant

BECKY

weight there and you left him

Deborah Kerr Winter must be cold for those with no

warm memories

our own What do you think

SAM

Sure Sure

Victoria waves goodbye and starts toward the jetway
As Sam watches her go Jonah looks at him sticks his

finger in his mouth and pretends to gag
SAM

(impatiently)
Jonah this isnt fair You
dont know Victoria I hardly
know her myself She is in
fact a mystery to me She
tosses her hair a lot Why
does she do this I have no
idea Is it a twitch Does
she need a haircut Should she
use barrette so it doesnt
keep falling in her face
These are things that Im
willing to get to the bottom
of and that is why I am dating
her That is all I am doing
I am not marrying her Can you
appreciate the difference
Thats what single people do
they try people on and they see
if they fit But nobody fits
perfectly everyone is an

adjustment

JONAH
Was Mom an adjustment

SAM
(complete exasperation)
Im never going to meet anyone
whos going to measure up to
your mom in your eyes What do
you think Theres a perfect

woman walking around out there

At that moment Annie emerges from the jetway right next

JONAH

The one who wrote us

Sam is preoccupied with Annie She takes a turn that he

doesnt expect Hes having trouble keeping up because
he has to wait for Jonah

JONAH

But Jessica says you and Annie
never got together in that
life and your hearts are like
puzzles with parts out of them
and when you get together the

puzzles complete

Hes lost Annie in the crowd Shes nowhere in sight

SAM

God dammit

A beat then Sam heads off to the exit Jonah follows

As they walk into the distance --
