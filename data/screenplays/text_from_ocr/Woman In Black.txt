THE WOMAN IN BLACK — A new dimension in terror

Young lawyer Arthur Kipps leaves his son in London to settle the legal affairs of the recently deceased Alice
Drablow He discovers a series of inexplicable accidents and suicides have forced the parents of her village
to barricade their children indoors as if protecting them from an unseen foeWhen Arthur stays the night
all alone at the Drablow’s foreboding house he hears the screams of a drowning child and sees decaying
children listlessly wandering the marshes He will soon discover these haunting figures share the same date
of death and the same killer

The ghost of a scorned woman who was unable to save her beloved son Nathaniel from drowning The
Woman In Black takes on a horrifying form Set on vengeance her veil hides gaping sockets eaten away by
scavengers and her curse hides an even darker secret whenever she is seen a child dies

In the face of hostility from the local residents Arthur dredges up Nathaniel’s skeleton and buries it with
his mother hoping the evil spectre will finally rest in peace In a cruel twist of fate The Woman In Black
turns her claws toward Arthur’s young son To avoid a fate worse than death Arthur must now sacrifice
everything he holds dear and save his child
DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT

Guillermo Del Toro has said that the best horror films are sad and scary in equal part These keynotes-
heart and horror- will determine my direction The Woman In Black is a story of love and loss want to
make it into a film that is tender as well as terrifying

First foremost terror Let me be clear want to make an edge-of-your-seat ghost house ride A film
that teenagers would want to see on a Friday night The story is set in the past but the telling cannot be
fusty It must be accessible want to create a world not a period want the audience to board the
ghost train with Kipps in London and take them into a dark horror fairytale closer in look to Tim Burton
than Pride And Prejudice want to lead the audience on a delicious thrill ride through this world jolts
and jumps chills and tingles setpieces of unbearable tension that track through the shadowy corridors
of the haunted house and the fog of the marshes Dominating this landscape the terrifying central
figure of the The Woman In Black raging behind her veil Like Sadako in The Ring think she can
become an iconic horror character a demon to invade people’s dreams

In Eden Lake wanted to ground the horror in reality so we shot with a raw aesthetic Here the film
should have an inky-black graphic novel sheen The camerawork should be the complete opposite of
costume drama not stately but subjective peering deep into bitumen blacks exploring our fears of
what we cannot see Production design is more about a dark sexiness than strict historical exactitude
think we should explore a costume tie-in campaign with a British brand- like Burberry- that has a long
history and contemporary style All aspects of the production- from casting to marketing- should
underline our modern take on this timeless tale of terror

Kubrick famously said that all films about the supernatural are inherently consoling they imply life after
death want the film with its heart-stopping ending to offer this consolation in a way that moves the
audience to tears

To achieve this attention must be paid to character Everyone in the story bears their own scars Kipps
has lost his wife and wraps his son in cotton wool the Woman in Black has lost her son and rages
against the world the villagers have lost their children and conspire to protect For me the smothering
dangers of such parental love- how far we will all go to protect our children- is the heartbeat of the film
and want to work at every stage to mine this emotion Casting is key Powerhouse actors who can
capture these characters who driven by loss circle each other in a taut psychological dance of death

have always been fascinated by our fears- think we all are With Eden Lake wanted to tap into our
modern fear of kids With The Woman In Black ’m interested in the flipside every parent’s fears for
their children The most relatable fear of all losing those we love think this thematic and emotional
richness will help the film reach out to a wider audience

want to make a dynamic and accessible film that combines the visceral kick of a ghost-train ride with
the lingering emotional resonance of supernatural thrillers like The Sixth Sense The Others and The
Orphanage In short an elevated genre film that tugs at the heart and chills to the bone

SALES and MARKETING GENRE

Horror is well established as one of the most commercial genres with proven appeal and demonstrable
worldwide returns from the box office and ancillary markets This is in part because it strongly appeals
to a younger more media savvy audience within which the most frequent cinema goers can be found

Key to success in this arena are strong characterisations and compelling scenarios and this of course is
where the artistic pedigree of a literary adaptation can be relied upon

INT GIFFORD ARMS - ATTIC ROOM DAY 2

A sparsely decorated but pleasant-enough country child’s
bedroom - three small beds a rocking horse a window-seat
beneath the open window

THREE LITTLE GIRLS 8 10 and 11 and dressed in simple mid-
period Victorian dresses and pinafores sit on the floor
playing tea party

TEDDY BEARS and PORCELAIN DOLLS are seated picnic-style
on a KERCHIEF as the girls cheerfully prepare them make-
believe cups of tea in a china TEA SET

Outside we can hear the chatter of the market-day crowd
Without warning the three girls stop and look up

simultaneously their eyes fixed on something across the
room their faces suddenly disturbingly blank

With steady synchronised movement the girls stand

The things they had been holding - china tea cups dolls -
drop from their hands and laps and fall to the floor

In eerily perfect unison the girls turn away from us to
face the window

As one they step daintily towards the window oblivious as
they knock over toys crush little china plates

They climb onto the window seat and stand in the frame of
the open window silhouetted against the bright sky

Then they jump

INT ARTHUR’S HOUSE - BEDROOM DAY 3

Staring blankly at himself in a washstand mirror ARTHUR

KIPPS 23 uses a cut-throat RAZOR to shave His shirt is
clean hair neat but he has a distracted distant look

He wipes his face with a washcloth

From 0S We hear a soft woman’s voice

FEMALE VOICE
Hello angel

Arthur closes his eyes a moment finishes wiping his face
then turns slowly wanting to prolong the moment

The room is empty No one but Arthur here

Behind him is a LADIES’ DRESSING TABLE A brush comb hand-
mirror perfume and powder are laid out neatly along with
a dish of SUNFLOWER SEEDS

Beside the dressing table is a BIRDCAGE From within a
MYNAH BIRD looks at Arthur its head cocked

He moves towards it carefully

ARTHUR
(whispering to the bird)
Again Say it again

Silence Then the bird speaks in a perfect imitation of
Arthur’s own voice

MYNAH BIRD
(in Arthurs voice)
Say it again

Arthur and the bird stare one another out

MYNAH BIRD (CONT’D)
(in Arthurs voice)
Not my voice Wretched bird

Arthur shakes his head in bleak amusement and feeds the
bird a couple of sunflower seeds

Arthur turns his back on the bird and busies himself closing
a SUITCASE that is lying on the bed nearby

Now we hear a different voice OS this time coming from
outside the room It belongs to Arthur’s son’s NANNY 50s

NANNY (0S)
Mr Kipps

ARTHUR
I’1ll be there in a moment

Arthur slips on a waistcoat and moves to the NIGHTSTAND He
opens a drawer and brings out a HIP FLASK He shakes it
near his ear and slips it into his trouser pocket

From on top of the nightstand he picks up a FOB WATCH
Observant aficionados of Victorian mourning jewelry might
note that the fob is woven from STRAWBERRY-BLONDE HAIR

Arthur clicks open the cover of the watch On the inside is
a portrait of a YOUNG WOMAN with hair the same colour

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Time to go

He snaps the cover shut leaves the room
In silence of the empty room the Mynah bird speaks again
this time in the same female voice we heard earlier

MYNAH BIRD

(in female voice)
See you later Angel

INT ARTHURS HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM DAY

A sheet of paper bearing a childs DRAWING a stick-figure
man waving to a stick-figure child outside a house Below
an uneven square contains the word “Tuesday”

Over this we hear a child’s voice It belongs to Arthur’s
son JOSEPH 3

JOSEPH
Do you like it Daddy

ARTHUR (0C)
Very much

Arthur sits in an armchair holding the drawing which we
notice is bound together with other pictures by a ribbon
Joseph frail and tiny perches on the arm of the chair

Arthur looks up as he hears Nanny just now entering the
room holding Arthur’s COAT She stops and regards Arthur’s
smart appearance with genuine surprise Arthur looks
himself up and down

ARTHUR (CONTD)
What

Nanny shakes her head apologetically -- nothing Joseph
squirms impatiently for attention pokes the calendar

JOSEPH
You didn’t look at it properly

ARTHUR
Of course I did Nanny have you
seen this Joseph made me a
calendar

NANNY
(winking at Joseph)
No sir Made it all by himself
didn’t you

JOSEPH
You can cross off the days ‘til
were back together

Arthur leafs through the other three pages Wednesday and
Thursday have just a named box
ARTHUR
I will

The final page Friday also bears a drawing a stick-
figure man carrying a stick-figure child Beside them is a
large train clouds of steam billowing from it’s engine

The stick-man’s face has a straight line for a mouth a
grave expression in contrast to the child’s big smile

Arthur peers at this his attention caught now

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Why do I look so sad

JOSEPH
That’s what your face looks like

ARTHUR
Oh it is is it

He scoops Joseph up onto his lap into his arms and growls
mock-crossly playfully tipping him backwards - an attempt
at playful rough-and-tumble that we get the impression

doesn’t happen very often

They both laugh But when the laughter dies Joseph

suddenly looks serious

JOSEPH

I wish you didn’t have to go away

from me
Arthur leans in to whisper to him

ARTHUR
Me too But we’ll have the whole
weekend in the countryside
(flipping through the
calendar)
See Tomorrow then Thursday
then we’re together again Not
long at all
(looking at the last
drawing)
Which reminds me - your tickets

NANNY
I Mr Kipps may I have a word

She gestures at Joseph not with him listening

ARTHUR
Can you fetch Daddy’s hat
please The brown one

Joseph trots away obediently Alone now Nanny looks

grave
NANNY
Are you sure about this Joseph
travelling in his condition The
doctor said -

ARTHUR
And I suppose the doctor reckons
all this smog is just the thing
for a bad chest does he

NANNY
Sir

ARTHUR
Getting out of London will do him
the power of good You’ll see

Joseph runs in carrying Arthur’s HAT He is out of breath

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Don’t run darling Don’t run

Arthur scoops him up and holds him close

EXT LONDON STREET DAY 5

The London street is filled with a thick yellow FOG and the
sound of HORNS blowing DRIVERS and PEDESTRIANS shouting as
people try to negotiate their way through it

At the open door of his house Arthur hurriedly grabs his
suitcase from Nanny He looks at his pocket watch -- reacts
in dismay Clearly he’s late

He hesitates as he looks out into the street FIGURES loom
out of the fog like ghosts scarves and veils clutched to
their faces

A glowing light approaches accompanied by the din of HOOVES
and WHEELS as A HANDSOME CAB clatters down the street
towards us and fades into view

Arthur registers this hesitates a moment -- should he --
then he hails it

He looks back to Nanny to see on her face the disapproving
expression he was obviously expecting

ARTHUR
Don’t worry - I wont be making a
habit of it I just can’t be late
Not today

She waves away his excuses with good-natured weariness
NANNY
If I was in this job for the money
Mr Kipps I’d have moved on a long
time ago

INT HANSOM CAB DAY

Arthur leans against the window suitcase at his feet
Outside visibility through the smog is virtually zero

Over this we hear MR BENTLEY 60s head of Arthur’s firm
BENTLEY (VO)
I don’t want you to regard this

assignment as any sort of short
straw Kipps

INT MR BENTLEY’S OFFICE DAY

An austere room Arthur sits across from Bentley a hulking
desk between them a sheaf of paperwork in Arthur’s hands

BENTLEY
I want you to view it as an
opportunity

ARTHUR
(leafing through it)
Widow Lived in India the past
twenty seven years One son died
in early childhood Leaving her
estate to charity Sounds
straightforward enough

BENTLEY
I expect you to retrieve the
deeds to her British home from
the local solicitor Mr Jerome
But principally you’re to go
through Mrs Drablows documents
Her private papers Bring back
anything of importance

Arthur nods Understood

BENTLEY (CONTD)
I must warn you that her paperwork
is likely to be in some disarray
She and her husband left England
rather suddenly And the house has
been empty ever since

ARTHUR
I’m sure I can tolerate a little
dust sir

BENTLEY
I’m sure you can

Bentley stands - Arthur follows suit - and hands over an
envelope

BENTLEY (CONTD)
The keys And funds to cover your
expenses
(a beat)
I’m hoping that you’ll seize this
chance to prove your dedication to
pursuing a future with this firm

Arthur is slightly taken aback by this

ARTHUR
I can’t afford to consider a
future without it

BENTLEY

I know these last years have been
difficult Kipps And I’m aware
of your need to fund your son’s
medical treatment You have my
sympathy But we cannot afford to
carry cargo And I’m increasingly
concerned that cargo is what you
have become

(a beat)
You have an opportunity to prove
me wrong Make use of it

OMITTED 8

EXT TRAIN DUSK 9

Daylight begins to fade and rain falls lightly as a STEAM
TRAIN cuts through the countryside

INT TRAIN DUSK 10

Inside Arthur shares a carriage with a LITTLE GIRL 4 and
her exceptionally pretty uniformed NURSEMAID 20s

It’s brightly lit in here cosy

Arthur holds a NEWSPAPER but doesn’t read it only stares
out of the window his mind wandering

The child watches him As if sensing this Arthur glances
over Smiles vaguely The little girl beams back

Arthur pulls a face and she dissolves into giggles

Arthur raises his newspaper before the Nursemaid notices
then when she’s looking away lowers it to reveal another
funny face More giggles Arthur hurriedly hides again

The Nursemaid speaks playfully to child but clearly for
Arthur’s benefit

NURSEMAID
Are you flirting with the
handsome man Wait ‘til I tell
your Mummy and Daddy

The child bounces wanting to play more Arthur complies
The Nursemaid stares at him smiling
Arthur nods back politely and begins to read the newspaper

oblivious to the girl’s irritation at his total lack of
interest in her

EXT COUNTRY STATION NIGHT 11

It’s dark and the rain heavier as Arthur carries the
nursemaid’s CASE and his own onto the lonely windswept
platform

Then he lifts the boy from the train and passes him to her

NURSEMAID
Thank you

The child’s face lights up as down the platform he spots
his waiting FATHER and MOTHER He wriggles from his nurse
runs to them and is happily scooped up in the man’s arms

Arthur watches wistfully as they leave

Moments later the train pulls away the warm glow of the

carriage interiors and smiling PASSENGERS within flashing

past then finally gone

-And Arthur is left entirely alone on the empty platform
in the darkness and rain

Nearby a CHALK BOARD reads

Last train for the Northeast 9 O’Clock

Rain sluices down over the board beginning to wash the
letters away

Arthur opens his POCKET WATCH and looks at the time in
dismay before closing it again and sitting down on the
solitary BENCH here drawing his coat around him and
holding his newspaper ineffectually over his head

He opens his pocket watch again but this time to look not
at the watch face but at the portrait

EXT COUNTRY STATION NIGHT 12

The chalk board is bare now just empty blackness slick
with rain In the distance we hear an approaching TRAIN

Arthur stands discarding his now sodden newspaper on the
bench

Momentarily the train arrives with a piercing WHISTLE
filling the damp air with a cloud of STEAM

This train is considerably shorter than the London train
squat and plain Inside the carriages are unlit It’s not
just unwelcoming it’s almost foreboding

Arthur moves through the steam and opens the door to a
darkened carriage with a mixture of relief and trepidation

EXT COUNTRYSIDE NIGHT 13

The grim little train moves through an endless stretch of
deserted countryside No houses no lights not a living
soul for miles around We’re in the middle of nowhere

INT UNWELCOMING TRAIN NIGHT 14

As the train rattles on Arthur sleeps alone in a carriage
his work file open in his lap

The train whistle SHRIEKS continuing for just a little too

long and we realise that the sound has mutated into
something that sounds very much like a woman’s SCREAM

INT ARTHUR’S HOUSE - UPPER HALL NIGHT 15

The woman’s piercing scream continues A younger Arthur
paces anxiously listens at a closed door paces again

The screaming ceases and Arthur rushes to the door
listening nervously Silence Then the cry of A BABY
Arthur breaks into a broad grin

As this new cry dies down we hear movement and low VOICES
from within Finally the door is opened by a DOCTOR 30s

DOCTOR
Mr Kipps

ARTHUR
Is it May I
(barging past)

Stella
DOCTOR
Mr Kipps
INT ARTHUR’S HOUSE - BEDROOM NIGHT 16

Arthur’s attention is instantly stolen by the sight of
Nanny standing by the door holding a swaddled BABY

NANNY
It’s a boy

Arthur reaches out instinctively too enraptured to notice
her odd expression and tone Gently she hands it to him

The baby stares at Arthur and Arthur stares back in awe

ARTHUR
Hello

In the bed beyond Arthurs wife STELLA 20 is propped
against a pillow her head bowed long strawberry blonde hair
hanging loose and damp with sweat

She doesn’t move

Arthur looks to the sombre-faced doctor to nanny and then
back to the bed again He reacts in queasy horror and now

we see what else he has seen what he failed to see before

The bottom half of the sheet is drenched in blood

DOCTOR
I’m so sorry Mr Kipps

Arthur clutches the baby close as the doctor leans Stella
back revealing her lifeless face and draws the sheet up

Over this image we hear another piercing SHRIEK

INT UNWELCOMING TRAIN NIGHT 17

The train whistle wakes Arthur from his nightmare

Arthur wipes the film of sweat from his forehead shakes
himself properly awake to realise --

A man is sitting opposite him now staring He is SAMUEL
DAILY 58 ostentatiously well-dressed Accompanying him is
his little dog SPIDER

The rest of the carriage is still empty

Arthur pets the dog

ARTHUR
Hello boy

DAILY
Her name’s Spider

For a while they ride on in silence as outside the rain
lashes the windows Daily peers at the file in Arthur’s lap

There’s an air of unease in his eyes in his voice when he
speaks

DAILY (CONTD)
Alice Drablow

ARTHUR
I’m her solicitor
(a beat)

Did you know her

Daily shrugs We sense that his now-casual manner is an act
requiring some effort

DAILY
Crythin Gifford’s a small place
(a small wry smile)
Supposed to sell Eel Marsh House
are you

Arthur gives him a quizzical look What did Daily mean by his
“good luck with that” tone

DAILY (CONT’D)
You’ll not find a local buyer

ARTHUR
Really Why’s that

Suddenly Daily looks like he regretted bringing the subject
up And there’s a sense of something unspoken in his reply

DAILY

(shrugging)
It’s not like the Drablows were
ever planning to come back Been

empty all that time -- anyone
wanted it they’d have bought it by
now

Arthur looks away stares out of the window Silence again -
just the rain lashing against the glass and the occasional
shriek of the whistle

DAILY (CONTD)
Staying at the Gifford Arms

Arthur nods

DAILY (CONTD)
Then allow me to drop you there
on my way home
(extending his hand)
Samuel Daily

EXT GIFFORD ARMS NIGHT 18

Daily’s impressive AUTOMOBILE pulls up outside the Gifford
Arms the inn we saw earlier Arthur climbs out wrestling
with his suitcase

Daily hands Arthur a BUSINESS CARD He shouts to be heard
over the rain

DAILY
Why don’t you join my wife and I
for supper tomorrow Don’t get to
see many new faces We’d welcome
the company Besides --
(re the inn disparaging)
You don’t want to eat here

Arthur opens his mouth to protest but it’s too late -
Daily has slammed the car door closed He pulls away

INT GIFFORD ARMS - ENTRANCE HALL NIGHT 19

The inn-keeper MR FISHER late 30s is at the desk Arthur
approaches

ARTHUR
Kipps Arthur Kipps I have a
room booked until Sunday

Fisher opens a LEDGER and runs his finger down a page He
shakes his head

FISHER
No Not finding a booking Let’s
see
(closing the ledger)
I’m sorry Mr Kipps it seems
were packed to the rafters

Arthur looks at him puzzled 0S we hear muted
conversation from the bar three or four people at most

ARTHUR
But my offices telegraphed
ahead and we were assured -

The inn-keepers wife - MRS FISHER mid 30s - enters

MRS FISHER
Evening sir

FISHER
I was just telling this gentleman
that we have no room at all

She looks confused then gestures to the bar with a weary
resigned look

MRS FISHER

Those loafers too soused to walk
home again

(to Arthur)
Well we can’t have you out on the
streets now can we

(to Mr Fisher)
We must have something Just for
tonight

Fisher looks at her with disdain

FISHER
But we don’t
(pointed rhetorical)
Unless you want to put him in the
attic

MRS FISHER
(calling his bluff)
Good idea

She leads Arthur towards the stairs her husband glaring

INT GIFFORD ARMS - UPPER HALL NIGHT
Arthur follows Mrs Fisher down the narrow hall

ARTHUR
-Actually I was hoping to stay
for the weekend -- my son and his
nanny are travelling up to join
me

MRS FISHER
I see That’s If a holiday’s
what you’re after sir youd
honestly be better off further
inland Gets awfully cold what
with the frets The sea mists

At the end of the hall is a BIRDCAGE a SHAWL thrown over
it for the night Arthur stops beside it

We may notice although Arthur doesn’t that there is a
PHOTOGRAPH on the wall here Mr and Mrs Fisher with their
daughters the girls from the ill-fated tea party

Arthur looks at the covered birdcage

MRS FISHER (CONT’D)
Mynah bird Hope you don’t mind
it Lot of folk find them
unsettling The mimicry and all

ARTHUR
No no I like them well enough
My wife had one

MRS FISHER
What happened to it

ARTHUR
Nothing

Mrs Fisher realises what he means She looks away

ARTHUR (CONTD)
They’re a fine bird

MRS FISHER
They are Nice to have someone to
talk to

Now it’s Arthur’s turn to read the upspoken feel awkward
But in the silence there’s a moment of connection

MRS FISHER (CONT’D)
It’s this way

Arthur follows her up a tiny narrow staircase towards a
tiny landing a single door

MRS FISHER (CONT’D)
How old is your son

ARTHUR
Three

Mrs Fisher fumbles with a large bunch of KEYS struggles to
unlock the door and to fight a wave of emotion

MRS FISHER
Lovely age
(a beat)
I’m afraid this room doesn’t get
used very often It’ll do for the
night though eh

INT HOTEL BEDROOM NIGHT 21

Arthur sits on a bed - there are three in here - and
surveys the room

It’s undoubtedly the one we saw the three little girls in
at the beginning but many years have since passed It’s
bare now the curtains faded and tattered the small
bedsteads rusted paint peeling from the walls

In the corner is a pile of items covered by dusty SHEETS

Arthur opens his case and gets out Josephs calendar and
his hip flask

He takes a long drink while staring at the calendar

He takes a pen from his pocket and draws a mark through the
box marked “Tuesday” Then he rolls up the calendar and
tucks it into the inside pocket of his COAT which is
hanging over the back of a nearby chair

Finally he takes his fob watch from his trouser pocket and
lays it carefully on the night stand

His fingertips linger on the watch

ARTHUR
Goodnight

He lies back on the bed staring ahead Thinking

The white sheets covering the pile of hidden items are
bright in the dim light of the bedroom Intriguing
unsettling

Curiosity piqued Arthur gets up and pulls off a sheet
to be greeted by an alarming old ROCKING HORSE the paint
peeling unpleasantly from its grimacing face

Beside it is a box of long-neglected DOLLS and TOYS
Looking again at the disturbing face of the rocking-horse

Arthur throws the sheet back over it and returns to the
bed

EXT VILLAGE STREET DAY 22

Arthur walks up the street It’s deserted aside from some
children in a front garden across the road

They are VICTORIA HARDY 7 and her brothers TOM 8 and
CHARLIE 5 They stare curiously at Arthur through the gaps
in their picket fence

Behind them their father GERALD HARDY 30s stares equally
curiously through a front window

Arthur smiles at the children

They don’t smile back

Seconds later Gerald Hardy emerges from indoors fixing
Arthur with a suspicious look He shouts across the road
Protectively he pulls his children away from the fence

HARDY
Yes Can I help you

ARTHUR
I’m looking for Mr Jerome

HARDY

(nodding up the street)
Next to the post-office

22A INT JEROME’S OFFICE DAY 22A

Arthur enters There’s nobody here

ARTHUR
Hello

No response beside a faint SHUFFLING noise from beneath
the floorboards

Arthur’s eyes move to a stairwell at the back of the room
that appears to lead down to a CELLAR The door is open
Arthur approaches slowly looks down to see

MRS JEROME 30s emerging from the cellar looking anxious
From outside the sound of a PONY AND TRAP approaching

MRS JEROME
Mr Kipps

ARTHUR
Yes

Mrs Jerome locks and bolts the cellar door behind her and
begins to ascend the stairs

MRS JEROME
My husband went to meet you at
the Gifford Arms

Beneath their feet the shuffling noise continues They both
hear it Mrs Jerome looks stressed But both of them are soon
diverted when --

The door to the street opens and MR JEROME 40s enters
fixing Arthur with a cold look

JEROME
I made it clear to your firm that
there was no need for you to make
the journey

Arthur waves away what he takes to be an apology

ARTHUR
It was only a few minutes walk

JEROME
The journey to Crythin Gifford Mr
Kipps We could have sent all the
relevant documents to London

Arthur is lost for words Jerome thrusts a FILE at him

JEROME (CONT’D)
In any event you’ll find
everything you need in here except
the deeds to the house Couldn’t
lay my hands on them I’m afraid
I’1l send them on when they turn
up Mr Fisher tells me you’re
leaving today

ARTHUR
No no Not until I’ve taken care
of Mrs Drablow’s paperwork

Jerome shakes his head anxious Points to the file

JEROME

All in there Like I said
ARTHUR

No -- at the house I’m told

there’s quite a substantial amount
of it I expect to be here until
Friday at least

Jeromes controlled facade slips even further revealing an
unmistakable sweaty anxiety

JEROME
Not possible The Gifford Arms is
fully booked For the week

ARTHUR
(a frustrated sigh)
I’m going to have to contact my
office Do you have a telephone

FISHER
Not even your friend Mr Daily has a
telephone sir You’ll not find one
in Crythin Gifford

ARTHUR
Fine I’1l1 send a telegram

Arthur turns to leave Jerome falls into step beside him

JEROME
Post office is closed on a
Wednesday morning
(a beat)
The London train leaves in half an
hour My colleague Keckwick is
waiting outside with your luggage

At the entrance Mr Jerome opens the door for Arthur and
politely gestures for him to leave Arthur steps out
confused and annoyed

JEROME (CONTD)
Pleasure to meet you Mr Kipps
And with that Jerome closes the door on him

OMITTED

EXT JEROME’S OFFICE DAY

Arthur stands before the closed door speechless

Not far from the entrance a PONY AND TRAP is waiting
Sitting atop it is KECKWICK 42 a weather-beaten man in
threadbare country clothes

Arthur’s suitcase is on the back of the trap

Fighting his anger Arthur climbs up beside Keckwick
Arthur glances back at the closed door to Jerome’s office

ARTHUR
Mr Keckwick Change of plans I’m
not catching the train I need to
get to Eel Marsh House

KECKWICK
Jerome paid me to take you to the
station

Arthur fishes in his pocket and produces the envelope
Bentley gave him He offers Keckwick a COIN from it

Keckwick stares at it unimpressed and gestures to the
envelope

KECKWICK (CONTD)
Make it six and I’1l think about
it

ARTHUR
Six shillings

KECKWICK
You’1l not find anyone else willing
to take you

Keckwick’s face tells us that he’s serious Arthur digs
resentfully into the envelope and hands over the cash

EXT CRYTHIN GIFFORD DAY 25

Arthur and Keckwick ride silently through the town
VILLAGERS stop to stare at Arthur as the trap passes There
are many weathered old faces here giving Arthur - and us -
an uneasy sense of rural ‘otherness’

As we pass one small cottage Arthur glances up to notice A
CHILD looking mournfully out of an upper window

But he attaches no significance to this and looks away
again his attention drawn now a bag of ROTTING APPLES that
sits between him and Keckwick attracting flies

ARTHUR
Not planning to eat those are
you

KECKWICK

For the pony

They ride on in silence

EXT MARSHES DAY 26

At the end of a road the pony trap arrives at the start of
a causeway - a narrow path snaking across an incredible
vista of shining marshland with EEL MARSH HOUSE perched
on it’s little island lying at it’s distant end

Arthur looks around in awe

Keckwick pulls hard on the pony’s reins barks a cautionary
noise of command as it veers a little off the pathway

Arthur steadies himself

ARTHUR
Bet these marshes can be
treacherous

Keckwick fixes Arthur with a look then picks up one of his
moldy apples and tosses it onto the apparently solid ground
beside the causeway

Within seconds it has been sucked down swallowed Gone
without a trace And likewise Arthur’s amusement

KECKWICK
Ask them what they reckon

He points ahead to where a TALL WOODEN CROSS is erected in
the marsh a few feet from the causeway

Silence reigns once again as they ride on broken only by
the eerie WHOOPS of the birds circling overhead

EXT EEL MARSH ISLAND DAY

Keckwick halts the trap at the beginning of the driveway
leading up to Eel Marsh house Arthur looks at him
puzzled and nods towards the house

But Keckwick doesn’t move He points up toward the house

KECKWICK
Storehouse is to the East by the
kitchen garden Should still be
some oil in there for the lamps

ARTHUR
I didn’t realise you knew the
house so well Mr Keckwick

KECKWICK
My father worked here all his
life

ARTHUR

Perhaps you could show me around
Keckwick shakes his head

KECKWICK
Need to get back to the mainland
before the tide comes in else I’1l
be stuck here for the day It’1ll be
out again by five I’1l come back
for you then

ARTHUR
The causeway won’t be passable
again until five

KECKWICK
Not unless you like swimming
(off his look)
Still have plenty of time to get to
the station for the late train

Arthur stares at Keckwick realises that he really isn’t
going to go any closer and climbs off the trap unable to
keep from laughing at the absurdity of the string of
obstructions he is meeting

EXT EEL MARSH HOUSE - GROUNDS DAY 28

The sound of the pony and trap recedes further and further
as Arthur walks up the drive carrying his bag He notes
to the East a crumbling FAMILY GRAVEYARD

But his attention is drawn away again by the imposing sight

of EEL MARSH HOUSE itself looming up ahead of him Vast
grey and magnificent against the open sky and marshland

EXT EEL MARSH HOUSE DAY 29

Silence now but for the birds Arthur reaches in his
pocket for key As he searches he notices

A few small MUDDY HANDPRINTS low down on the front door
Child-sized child-height

Arthur lets himself in

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - ENTRANCE LOBBY DAY 30

A dark entrance hall Arthur inches along the wall until he
finds a LAMP He fumbles with it but it doesn’t light

He opens the first door he finds

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM DAY 31

Faint rectangles of daylight glow around the shuttered
windows but still we can’t make out much detail in here

Arthur moves to the closest window tries to open the
shutters but they’re wedged fast warped with age

The other set of shutters is also stuck firmly closed
Arthur tries a nearby WALL LAMP Nothing
Something - it sounds like a pile of papers - falls to the

floor as Arthur fumbles with a DESK-LAMP This too fails

EXT EEL MARSH HOUSE DAY 32

Arthur walks around the East side of the house past a
barren KITCHEN-GARDEN

EXT STOREHOUSE DAY 33

Arthur arrives at the STOREHOUSE that Keckwick mentioned

He swats the cobwebs from the handle of the warped and
dilapidated storehouse door and tries it The years have
wedged it tightly shut

Eventually he shoulders it open

INT STOREHOUSE DAY 34

The daylight from outside provides just enough illumination
for Arthur and us to survey the contents of the room

A pile of LOGS are stacked against one wall and against
the other a plethora of GARDENING TOOLS and VARIOUS
CONTAINERS

Spying what he needs Arthur grabs a canister of LAMP OIL

EXT EEL MARSH HOUSE DAY 35

As Arthur walks back past the kitchen garden carrying his
canister he stops unsettled Carried on the wind is
something that sounds unmistakably like CHILDREN’S VOICES

Arthur squints towards the marshes but can see nothing
untoward Nevertheless the sound of voices persists

Still carrying his canister he walks towards the marshes

ARTHUR
Hello

As he moves further down the drive the very observant may
notice - though some may not - a WOMAN IN BLACK looking out
over the marshes from an upper window of the house

The closer Arthur gets to the marshes the louder and more
distinct the children’s voices become

But no children are to be seen Just the marsh the tide
coming in Trapping Arthur here on the island

Suddenly as if sensing that someone is watching him Arthur
turns uneasily to look back at the house Nothing there

In an increasing state of discomfort Arthur turns and begins
to walk briskly back toward the house

OMITTED 36

EXT EEL MARSH HOUSE DAY 37

Arthur opens the front door the haste in his movements
conveying an intangible desire to get indoors fast

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - ENTRANCE LOBBY DAY 38

Arthur closes the door behind him hesitates a moment then
bolts it shut

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM DAY 39

Canister of oil in hand Arthur stumbles into the darkened
room

We may make out a slight tremble in Arthur’s hand as he
uses the canister of oil to fill the desk lamp

He lights it
And surveys the now-illuminated room an untidy testament
to Mrs Drablows unstable mental state The entire surface

of the desk is covered with LETTERS and DOCUMENTS

He picks up a POKER from the fireplace and uses it to crow-
bar open the stuck window shutter

Light streams in Arthur looks around and sees now --

In fact every surface in the room is covered is dusty stacks
of PAPERS Bills receipts letters pamphlets

This is a thousand times worse than Arthur imagined

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - STUDY DAY 39A

Another room Arthur enters looks around His face falls

The shutters are open in here and all around the room we can
plainly see more untidy piles of PAPERWORK

Arthur sifts through a few items on the desk
Bank statements estimates prescriptions postcards
Arthur gathers up a large armful as many as he can carry

and leaves the room

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM DAY 39B

Arthur places a pile of papers on a large table

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL DAY 39C

Arthur exits another room with another armful of papers
39D

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM DAY 39D

The large table is now covered in stacks of paperwork Arthur
sets down the ones he is carrying

He looks around the room taking in the enormity of the task
ahead Overwhelmed Utterly dismayed

Among some of the debris nearby he notices

A DECANTER of brandy and TWO GLASSES thick with dust

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - KITCHEN DAY 40

DIRTY WATER chokes in noisy spurts from a faucet into a
long-unused SINK Somewhere distant in the walls of the
house pipes THUMP and RATTLE in complaint

Arthur pumping the handle sighs and abandons his efforts
The kitchen is bleak under three decades of dust On the
counter is the decanter and a glass from the drawing room
Arthur grabs an old DISHCLOTH and beats it on the counter
sending thick clouds of DUST dancing in the shafts of light
that stream through the grimy windows

He wipes the glass pours a large brandy and drains it

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - STAIRCASE DAY 41

Arthur climbs the stairs The walls here are dotted with
PORTRAITS and PHOTOGRAPHS He glances at them as he walks

A formal portrait of MR AND MRS DRABLOW AND THEIR SON 6
A formal portrait of THE SON alone
A framed formal photograph of the three DRABLOWS standing

outside Eel Marsh House

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - UPPER HALLWAY DAY 42

Arthur walks the upper hallway trying each door in turn
The first on his left reveals a EMPTY ROOM devoid of
furniture or window-dressings And most importantly
paperwork

He breathes a sigh of relief opens the next door along
Behind it

A JUNK ROOM Filled with TRUNKS BOXES And more
DOCUMENTS

Arthur’s heart sinks He doesn’t even bother to enter for
now instead continuing down the hallway on his inspection
his steps growing increasingly heavy

The third door at the very end of the hallway is firmly
locked shut

Arthur wrestles with the handle for a while then
eventually gives up trying to open it

He returns down the other side of the hall

The first door reveals a BOX ROOM - perhaps once a small
bedroom for guests or staff Just a bed a closet and a
built-in window seat Mercifully free of junk or
paperwork

The curtains are closed Shafts of light slant in from

above through exposed slats where a section of the roof has
succumbed to the elements He enters

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - BOX ROOM DAY 43

Arthur opens the curtains the window affords a clear
view down to the marshes beyond

Arthur kneels on the window seat and peers out scanning

the landscape He sees nothing untoward but tenses a
little when he hears a faint SCRABBLING noise nearby

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - UPPER HALLWAY DAY

Arthur opens the door to the next room It’s a small
BATHROOM The window affording the same view as the Box Room

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - BATHROOM DAY

As Arthur steps in he hears the noise again He freezes
Nothing Then the noise again Arthur presses his ear to

the wall dividing this room from the not-yet-investigated
room next door

A long pause then the noise It’s definitely in there

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - UPPER HALLWAY DAY 44

Outside the closed door to the next room Arthur gathers
himself and turns the handle The door fails to open but
this time the noise from within is not so much a scrabbling
as a sudden THUMP Arthur jumps back

Gingerly he turns the KEY that is in the lock beneath the
handle Almost immediately another THUMP

Arthur opens the door to discover a BEDROOM The
curtains drawn Dark but for the same shafts of light
through the ruined roof And silent He steps in

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - BEDROOM DAY 45

The shafts of daylight shine onto a dresser crowded with
medicinal-looking BOTTLES Dimly we can also see a bureau
that is covered with PAPERS

Arthur stands very still eyes darting around the room The
SCRABBLING noise is louder now frantic low to the ground

Arthur scans the ill-lit floor

A noise - though not the same noise as the one he heard
before this time a HIGH-PITCHED SQUEALING - leads Arthur
deeper into the room to the FIREPLACE where he finds

A NEST filled with BABY BIRDS Their beaks are wide open in
the hope of receiving food Eight wide dark gaping holes
out of proportion with their tiny bodies

Arthur exhales relieved

Then he notices one RUNTISH BABY BIRD has fallen out of
the nest and is writhing on the hearthstone It’s both
pitiful and creepy in its naked vulnerability

Arthur bends down and replaces it in the nest

Suddenly an almighty FLURRY - this is the noise he heard
before - and a BIRD flies past Arthur THUMPING into the
wall behind him It drops to the ground stunned

Arthur reacts shocked but - again - relieved He looks up
to the gaping ceiling where the bird must have got in

then back at the bird itself

Arthur moves to the window where he pulls open the
curtains

Arthur steps back in alarm

EXT EEL-MARSH HOUSE - GROUNDS DAY 46

Arthur’s distant elevated POV but still we plainly see

In the graveyard the WOMAN IN BLACK Standing perfectly
still Dressed in the formal funeral garb of the mid-1800s
her bonnet and mourning veil concealing her face in a way
that makes us nervous as to what might be under there

Arthur stares transfixed until suddenly --
47-48

A loud THUMP as the bird flies at the window beside him It
falls to the ground by his feet dazed

Watching the bird Arthur grasps the handles of the sash
window and with some effort wrestles it open

When he looks out again the Woman in Black has gone
The baby birds scream for food
On the floor the bird stands frozen in fear

Distractedly as he moves to leave Arthur pokes it with his
toe He points to the window

ARTHUR
Youve got mouths to feed Go

OMITTED 47-48

EXT EEL MARSH HOUSE DAY 49

Arthur bursts out into the daylight A light MIST has begun
to descend

EXT EEL MARSH HOUSE - GROUNDS DAY 50

Arthur heads down the drive looking towards the graveyard
eyes searching for any sign of the woman he just saw

She could be concealed by the mist but for all that we - and
Arthur - can tell there’s no one there

Suddenly the silence is interrupted by the unmistakable
sound in the far distance of A PONY AND TRAP

Arthur checks his pocket watch It’s ten to five
Arthur squints down towards the marshes but the mist is
growing heavier the bottom of the driveway and the marshes

barely visible

As Arthur walks further down the drive the steady rhythm of
hooves and wheels is suddenly replaced by a CLATTERING

Arthur stops in his tracks This doesn’t sound good at all
A PONY whinnies in panic

Arthur begins to sprint through the mist towards the
catastrophic sounds coming from the marsh

A MAN cries out

ARTHUR
Keckwick
Now what sounds like a child’s SCREAM And a woman’s voice

WOMAN (0S)
Keckwick

Horrified Arthur runs blindly down the driveway into the
white nothingness ahead towards the anguished cries

EXT NINE LIVES CAUSEWAY DAY 51

The mist seems to be getting thicker still and Arthur
begins to move ahead a little more gingerly

The mainland is entirely obscured from view The only visible
landmark is the faint indistinct outline of the wooden cross
out in the marsh

Looking down Arthur notes with dismay that he can no longer
see the ground beneath him

Reluctantly he looks back only to find that the mist is
all around now he can see nothing in any direction

The noise ahead - clattering whinnying screams are
horribly loud now Treading carefully Arthur steels himself
and moves through the whiteness towards it

ARTHUR
Keckwick

Panicking Arthur finds his shoe mired the marsh He pulls
himself free and stumbles back onto the causeway Through the
shifting mist he glimpses fragments of a horrific scene
Wheels sink deep into the marsh

A pony bares its teeth as it struggles

Skirts billow as a woman tries to climb to safety

CHILD (0S)
Mummy

Arthur hears a loud THUMP Like someone landing heavily on
the causeway nearby

We hear a child’s piercing scream

Arthur scrambles onward He can no longer make out anything
through the mist but we can hear a woman SOBBING And

whispering

WOMAN (0OS)
Sorry I’m so sorry
52-54

But now her whispers are drowned out lost in a louder

noise a ghastly SUCKING NOISE
Then silence

Arthur stops chilled to the core

He inches ahead in the whiteness silence Until out of the

mist looms

KECKWICK On foot Alive and well Arthur bumps right into

him

EXT POLICE STATION DAY

A small rural police station

INT POLICE STATION DAY

52-54

Arthur stands across a counter from an old policeman PC
ROBERT COLLINS 60 who fills in a form very very slowly
his calm demeanor providing stark contrast to Arthur’s state

of agitation

PC COLLINS

No one’s used Nine Lives Causeway
for years sir No one visits Eel

Marsh House - it’s empty

ARTHUR

I know what I heard Constable

PC COLLINS

But your companion heard nothing

ARTHUR
So he said

PC COLLINS

Well at any rate we can’t get
anyone out there until this fret
lifts As Mr Keckwick explained
to you causeway’s not safe for a
cart in a fret Barely safe on

foot

ARTHUR

I know For god’s sake --

PC COLLINS

Leave it with me we’ll send

someone

ARTHUR
When

Collins raises his hand indicating for Arthur to wait He
writes some more painfully slowly until - from somewhere
in a back room - a BELL rings He downs his pen

PC COLLINS
Excuse me one moment sir

Arthur can’t hide his frustration as very slowly Collins
shuffles away into a back room

Just the sound of a clock TICKING now as Arthur waits

Momentarily the front door opens to reveal Tom Hardy The
boy looks to the empty desk then at Arthur

ARTHUR
He’ll be back in just a moment I
think Is everything alright

The boy shakes his head With a growing sense of dread
Arthur looks behind the boy to see that hanging back a few
feet behind him are the younger boy Charlie and their
sister Victoria The girl looks horribly ill

Arthur leaps to his feet

ARTHUR (CONTD)
What happened

Charlie and Victoria step in silently The little girl is
deathly pale and stares straight at Arthur a blank
glazed wide-eyed stare None of the children speak

Tom points at his sister

The girl’s eyes stay locked onto Arthur’s as he drops to
his knees and takes her gently by the arms

ARTHUR (CONTD)
What’s the matter
(off her silence)
What’s your name Can you tell me
your name

TOM
Her name’s Victoria Hardy

ARTHUR
Can you tell me what’s wrong
Victoria Did something bad
happen

TOM
She drank some lye Our mam was
out

CHARLIE
It’s wash day

ARTHUR
Lye Oh god
(shouting)
Constable

TOM
Is she going to die

ARTHUR
Constable

CHARLIE
My cat died He went to heaven

ARTHUR
We need a doctor
(softly to Victoria)
It’s alright darling It’s going
to be alright

Eyes still fixed on Arthur her face remaining
expressionless the little girl’s jaw falls slack anda
stream of THICK BLOODY VOMIT spills from her mouth and
spatters down her front and onto the floor

EXT CRYTHIN GIFFORD DAY 57

Arthur sits on a low wall shell-shocked

Some distance away up the street we can see the police
station And outside it a small CROWD that has formed

Arthur watches numbly as a woman MRS HARDY stumbles out of
the police station barely able to stand supported by a
DOCTOR and A FEMALE NEIGHBOUR

Moments later Gerald Hardy follows He is carrying his
daughter’s BODY Wrapped in a blanket

The grief of these parents is almost unbearable to watch
Arthur looks away draws his flask from his inside pocket

and goes to drink from it not caring who sees only to
find that it’s empty

INT GIFFORD ARMS - ENTRANCE HALL DAY 58

The entrance hall is deserted

ARTHUR
Hello

Receiving no reply he walks through to the bar room

INT GIFFORD ARMS - PUBLIC ROOM DAY 59

The bar room is deserted too Not a soul here

ARTHUR
Hello

In the empty silence Arthur can now hear a sound coming

from upstairs It’s faint but sounds distinctly like a
woman sobbing

INT GIFFORD ARMS - ENTRANCE HALL DAY 60

Arthur wanders uneasily back into the entrance hall The
sound of sobbing is louder here coming from upstairs

ARTHUR
Mrs Fisher

INT GIFFORD ARMS - UPPER HALL DAY 61

Arthur makes his way down the hall towards the sound

It is a moment before he realises that it is coming from
the birdcage

Grimly fascinated he stares at the mynah bird within Its
beak is open utterly human-sounding sobs coming from it

Now for the first time Arthur notices the family photograph
on the wall here The sobbing continues as he stares at it

MRS FISHER
Mr Kipps

Arthur turns a little startled to see Mrs Fisher emerging
from a nearby bedroom carrying a pile of folded sheets

The bird continues its horrible imitation of her crying

There’s nothing either of them can say

INT GIFFORD ARMS - PUBLIC ROOM DAY 62

Mrs Fisher pours Arthur a large brandy

MRS FISHER
Say when

He stares at her The glass fills Still he says nothing
She stares back still pouring Her look says she
understands

She walks back to the bar replaces the bottle and begins
to busy herself wiping dust from the other bottles

The cheerful demeanor she displayed when we and Arthur met
her first is a distant memory She seems troubled

MRS FISHER (CONTD)
There was nothing you could have
done you know

He throws her a look Oh really It’s one she recognizes

MRS FISHER (CONTD)
If you hadn’t done this or that
Or been distracted If the events
of the day had shifted by only a
minute Everything would be
different Trust me Mr Kipps
thinking that way can drive you
to madness

He drains his glass dry and tips it in her direction

ARTHUR
Or drink Join me for one

MRS FISHER
It’s getting late You’1l miss
the London train

ARTHUR
I still have work to do here

MRS FISHER
My husband will be back soon

Behind the bar Mrs Fisher stands stock still She’s not
going to be serving any more drinks Arthur shakes his head
in amused resignation and stands to put on his coat

ARTHUR
I’ve never met a publican so hell-
bent on avoiding custom

MRS FISHER
He means well I assure you

Arthur smiles wistfully at her as he places a handful of
coins on the bar and turns to leave He is surprised when
Mrs Fisher catches his arm a little too tightly

MRS FISHER (CONTD)
Mr Kipps Sir You said you
have a son

ARTHUR
Yes

MRS FISHER
Go home to him Cherish him

Arthur is taken aback by her odd change of mood this
strange statement He wrests his arm from her grip
ARTHUR
Believe me Mrs Fisher I

wouldn’t be here if it weren’t
for the fact that I love my son

OMITTED 63

EXT CRYTHIN GIFFORD CHURCHYARD DAY 64

Arthur walks at a brisk pace through the churchyard past
row upon row of GRAVES many with recently-placed FLOWERS
He pays them no mind until he notices

On one is a weather-beaten TEDDY BEAR Threadbare and
bleached silvery grey by years in the elements

Arthur pauses overcome with sadness Then he walks on now
uneasily noticing details on the other plots he passes

One reads THOMAS BROWN May 25th 1861 - May 23rd 1872 The
headstone bears the carved image of a lamb

On the next grave a shrivelled DAISY CHAIN is draped over
the headstone

On the next a sleeping CHERUB STATUE and the inscription
“Taken from us too young”

The one next to that someone has left a small WOODEN TOY
TRAIN

Though we put no emphasis on this the observant among us
may note that these last three graves bear the same date of
death May 23rd 1872

Unsettled Arthur checks his watch and picks up his pace

EXT PICTURESQUE LANE DUSK 65

Arthur stops at a set of wrought iron GATES

Behind them is a sweeping drive leading up to a MANOR
HOUSE Arthur opens the gates and sets off up the drive

EXT DAILY’S HOUSE - GROUNDS DUSK 66

Arthur is halfway to the house when Spider the dog bounds
up to him

ARTHUR
Spider Hello girl

Moments later Daily emerges from an avenue of trees

Arthur calls out as

t on my way back Just

bidding my son Nicholas a good

night

The two begin to wal

Daily smiles ruefull

lk together Spider following behind

ly and gestures beyond the trees Arthur

looks back to see that the end of the avenue lies a small

white MAUSOLEUM

to the front entrance of the house now but Daily stops

May I ask

you a favour Mr

ARTHUR

DAILY
heard about the girl in

know It’d be best if you could

avoid the

subject of children in general if
at all possible

Before Arthur can speak the door is opened by a BUTLER

INT DAILYS HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL NIGHT 67

MRS DAILY 58 appears behind the Butler grinning broadly

MRS DAILY
Mr Kipps I’ve been so looking
forward to meeting you

ARTHUR
The pleasure’s all mine

The butler helps Arthur out of his coat
Mrs Daily reacts a little startled

Arthur looks down to realise he’s looking pretty
dishevelled Mud on his trousers from his stumble on the
causeway Tiny spatters of Victoria Hardy’s blood on his
white shirt He rearranges his jacket to cover them up

ARTHUR (CONTD)
I I do apologise for not
changing I seem to have found
myself without a room

MRS DAILY
Well then you must stay here
mustn’t he Samuel

DAILY
Aye Come on Let me get you
something to drink

Daily steers Arthur towards the drawing-room

MRS DAILY
Oh but first you must meet the
twins
(calling up the stairs)
Sarah Emily

DAILY
My dear I’m sure Mr Kipps
doesn’t -

He tails off as we hear a SCAMPERING noise on the stairs
and two LITTLE DOGS bound down into the hall Both wear
immaculate little dresses and bonnets with white mittens
on their fore-paws and patent leather booties on their
hind ones

The overall effect falls somewhere on the wrong side of the
line between comical and disturbing and Arthur tries to
hide his discomfort

MRS DAILY
Now now girls what have I said
about running about

ARTHUR
What a charming pair

Mrs Daily scoops up one dog in either arm cradling them on
their backs beaming with pride

MRS DAILY
(to the dogs)
Say hello to Mr Kipps
Arthur nods awkwardly Mr Daily gives his wife a sharply
disapproving look which she ignores

INT DAILYS DINING ROOM NIGHT 68

Arthur and the Dailys follow the Butler into the formal-
looking room but anger floods Mr Daily’s face as he sees

Two additional places - with TINY CHINA PLATES - have been
set at the table before two infants’ HIGH CHAIRS

DAILY
(to butler testy)
We have a guest Archer The
twins won’t be dining with us
this evening

The Butler moves swiftly to begin clearing the tiny plates

MRS DAILY
But Samuel

ARTHUR
(to Daily)
Truly it makes no odds to me

Samuel sighs and nods tersely to the Butler who replaces
the plates as Daily and Arthur take their seats

Mrs Daily places the dogs in the high chairs and ties BIBS
around their necks before sitting down in between them

TWO MAIDS step in and serve the first course
Mrs Daily begins to feed one of the dogs with a TEASPOON

MRS DAILY
Are you married Mr Kipps

Before Arthur has a chance to reply Mrs Daily looks
sharply to her husband who is looking away stony-faced
feeding a table-scrap to Spider who sits at his feet

MRS DAILY (CONTD)
SAMUEL I have TOLD you not to
feed that animal at the table
(MORE)

MRS DAILY (CONT’D)
(brightly to Arthur)
Any children

ARTHUR
(avoiding Daily’s eye)
A son
MRS DAILY

Glad to hear it You don’t want
to end up like this poor sap
Wealthiest man in the county and
no one to leave it all to The
good Lord’s little joke

(a beat)
Did he tell you about Nicholas

DAILY
Elizabeth

MRS DAILY
That’s him

She points across the room to a portrait on the wall A
rather tacky chocolate-box number featuring a little
blonde boy wearing a sailor suit in a pastoral setting
rendered slightly creepy by the presence of a heavenly
“doorway” of bright white light near him obscuring much of
the sky

Arthur looks at it uncomfortably

ARTHUR
A handsome portrait

MRS DAILY
I painted it myself I love to
paint and sketch

ARTHUR
Well it’s excellent You’re -

MRS DAILY
Nicholas loved to sketch too
(a beat)
He still does

DAILY
Elizabeth

MRS DAILY
(to Arthur)
Nicholas wants to draw a picture
for you right now

DAILY
Elizabeth no

Arthur looks at Daily in desperate confusion then back to
Mrs Daily Whose eyes roll back into her head as she
begins to have some kind of seizure Her arms flail and
she knocks her plate to the ground Her little dogs BARK

Daily leaps up and runs from the room leaving Arthur alone
Arthur watches in mute distress as Mrs Daily blindly grabs

for her STEAK KNIFE A beat then she begins frantically to
carve into the surface of the table

All the while the two dressed-up dogs bark in their
highchairs

Momentarily Daily returns with the maid who is carrying a
bottle of LAUDANUM The two struggle to subdue Mrs Daily
and administer it She fights them still stabbing at the
table until the knife is eventually wrested from her grip

MRS DAILY
No Nicholas hasn’t finished

Finally the medicine administered she falls silent The
dogs do too The maid loosens Mrs Daily’s collar as Mr
Daily stands up to leave the table He gestures for Arthur
to follow him

ARTHUR
Is she going to be alright

DAILY
Aye

INT DAILYS STUDY NIGHT 69

The men sit by the fire drinking On the table by Daily are
a number of family PHOTOGRAPHS mostly featuring his son

DAILY
I’m very sorry Arthur I thought
some youthful company might do
her good

ARTHUR
Please think nothing of it

DAILY
If she’d only take her
medication But she believes
it’s our son using her to
communicate I take it you’re not
one for all this fashionable
spiritualist claptrap

ARTHUR
Tried it once My wife wasn’t in
the habit of ringing bells and
wobbling tables when she was
alive SO

DAILY
Forgive me I didn’t Bloody
charlatans Preying on those most
in need Makes my blood boil

ARTHUR
Well It’s good to meet a
fellow sceptic

DAILY
Likewise They’re in short supply
round these parts As you’ve no
doubt found out for yourself
(off Arthur’s blank look)
You mean they let you go to Eel
Marsh House without any nonsense

Arthur’s mind begins to race

ARTHUR
What do you What sort of
nonsense

But Daily isn’t going to be drawn He waves the subject away

DAILY
You know Country ghost stories
Glad they had the sense to realise
a Londoner like yourself wouldn’t
abide them I’m the same Can’t
stand that rot

(a beat)

You and your wife me and
Nicholas we will be together
again When you die you go up
there You don’t stay down here

ARTHUR
I’d like to believe that

DAILY

I have to Else how would I get out
of bed

INT DAILY’S HOUSE - BEDROOM NIGHT 72

On the wall in this guest bedroom is another painting
presumably by Mrs Daily A beach landscape featuring four
little boys their backs to us wading in the sea

One of the boys has the same pale blonde hair we recognise
from the portrait of Nicholas Daily

(Further up the beach a woman watches them her back to us
also We probably wont notice this detail but if we do
we’ll assume it is a motherly figure)

Arthur studies the painting for a moment then turns his
attention to a large pair of PYJAMAS that have been left on
the bed for him to borrow He holds them up

He removes his jacket hangs it over the back of a chair
and searches the inner pocket It’s empty

Quietly he opens the door and steps out into the hall

INT DAILY’S HOUSE - UPPER HALL NIGHT 73

As Arthur creeps down the hallway he passes the open door
to Mrs Daily’s bedroom At first his eye is drawn to two
CRADLES one empty one occupied by a dog in a nightgown

Then a disconcerting glimpse of Mrs Daily sitting up in
bed cradling the other dog Oh my god is she nursing it

Arthur hurries past but it’s too late - she’s seen him

MRS DAILY
Mr Kipps

ARTHUR
(averting his eyes)
Sorry to disturb you I needed to
fetch something from my coat

MRS DAILY
Someone close to you is ill
That’s why you’re still here

ARTHUR
Excuse me

MRS DAILY
Nicholas told me He knows these
things And he says the situation
is graver than you know

ARTHUR
I I see I hope he’s wrong

77-78

MRS DAILY
Nicholas is never wrong Mr
Kipps
INT DAILY’S HOUSE - CLOAKROOM NIGHT 74

Arthur’s coat is hanging here He rifles desperately in the
inner pockets Relief washes over him as he retrieves

Josephs calendar He raises it to his face and closes his
eyes searching for the comforting scent of his son

Then he turns the page draws a PENCIL from his pocket and
draws a line through the box marked “Wednesday”

He flips forward through the next page to the final one -
Friday the picture of himself Joseph and the train He
presses the calendar close to his heart then turns back to
the blank “Thursday” page and rolls it up again

INT DAILY’S HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL NIGHT 75

Still holding the calendar Arthur makes his way back
towards the stairs As he walks however his attention
wanders to the open door of the dining room

He reacts in alarm and fear at something within With a
sense of dread he changes course for a closer look

INT DAILY’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM NIGHT 76
Arthur stops cold in the doorway as we now see

The DRAWING carved into the surface of the table by Mrs

Daily Incomplete child-like but easily recognisable as a
depiction of the woman in black a noose around her neck

INTEXT DAILY’S CAR DAY 79

Daily’s automobile drives through the deserted side streets
of Crythin Gifford It’s eerily silent

Inside Arthur sits beside Daily with Spider on his knee

ARTHUR

The shops and offices we pass are closed the houses dark

Unsettled Arthur looks back to see in the
deserted home TWO VERY YOUNG CHILDREN The

Before Daily can respond both men hear an
from beneath the floorboards Spider barks

That noise I heard it before

where he first saw Mrs Jerome

OMITTED 82

INT CELLAR STAIRWELL DAY 83

Arthur tries the door It’s locked He puts his ear to it
but now all is silent within

He puts his eye to the KEYHOLE and peers inside

INT JEROME’S CELLAR DAY 84

From Arthur’s POV we see a limited view of the cellar It
has been converted into some kind of room for habitation
with a bed in one corner But it seems to be unoccupied

We hear Arthur breathing but gradually we realise that
this is not all someone else is breathing too

A split second later our view of the room is obscured by
AN EYE looking back at us

INT JEROME’S CELLARCELLAR STAIRWELL DAY 85

Arthur leaps away in distress and at the same time we
hear a SCREAM from within the cellar - the owner of the
eye just as shocked as Arthur

Arthur braces himself to look again and sees

A PALE GIRL 12 scuttling backwards terrified

ARTHUR
Wait

The girl huddles in a corner of the cellar silent
Hearing the commotion Daily and Spider run down the steps

DAILY
What is it

ARTHUR
(low to Daily)
There’s a girl down here
(through the door)
Were going to get you out

DAILY
Arthur -

The girl stares at him wild-eyed

ARTHUR
I’m not going to hurt you

PALE GIRL
You killed Victoria Hardy
Arthur reacts in shock confusion
PALE GIRL (CONT’D)

GET AWAY FROM ME

EXT JEROME’S OFFICE DAY 86

A shell-shocked Arthur walks back to the car with Daily

ARTHUR
Do you think she’s going to be
alright

DAILY

Aye As well as she can be with
the Jeromes for parents

INTEXT DAILY’S CAR DAY 87

Daily’s car drives through the countryside

Arthur sits beside Daily Spider on his lap hindering his
efforts to leaf through the papers in the stolen file

ARTHUR
And here - look Two attempted
sales by Jerome himself Buyers
from outside the area

DAILY
I said he was fearful of visitors
to Eel Marsh House Didn’t say he’d
always been that way People can’t
stand the idea that misfortune
strikes without rhyme or reason
The need to explain bad luck can
turn the wisest man into a
superstitious fool

ARTHUR
Jerome has suffered misfortune

DAILY
All families suffer misfortune at
some time Arthur

They round a curve The marshes and causeway come into view
ahead Along with a line of people - Jerome Keckwick
Fisher PC Collins Gerald Hardy an ELDERLY MAN and four
other VILLAGE MEN - forming a human blockade

Daily slams on the brakes and the car comes to a stop

Daily and Arthur catch their breath and exchange looks
The men walk towards the car

JEROME (0OS)
Your work here is complete Mr
Kipps

FISHER
We don’t wish you any ill We
just think it’s high time you
went home

PC COLLINS
For your own good For the good
of us all Turn this contraption
around Mr Daily

ARTHUR
(to Daily steely)
Don’t

The mob stand silent and menacing A tense stand-off
Finally Daily puts the car into reverse
The car continues to reverse erratically down the lane away
from the mob and the marshes Arthur looks at him
incredulous
ARTHUR (CONTD)
Sam what the hell I have a
job to do
DAILY
I know Which is why I’m taking
you to the one place the village
idiots won’t dare follow

Daily changes gears and the car lurches violently forwards

Daily’s car veers off the lane and into a field
circumventing the mob entirely

The men watch in disbelief as the car circles behind them
back onto the path and out onto Nine Lives Causeway

EXT EEL MARSH HOUSE DAY 88

Arthur exits the car Daily passes him a small LUNCH SACK

DAILY

Arthur begins to walk towards the house Daily calls after
him

DAILY

Arthur Do something for me Take

EXT EEL MARSH HOUSE DAY 89

Arthur and Spider stand by the front door dwarfed against
the landscape as they watch the car shrink into the
distance

Arthur looks up at the house hesitates Then he turns the
door handle

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM DAY 90

Standing beside a WALL CLOCK Arthur checks the time on his
pocket watch He lingers a moment to look at Stella’s
portrait as if drawing strength from it then snaps the
watch shut and resets the hands on the clock

He winds it up It begins to TICK loudly The house is coming
back to life

Like a man going into battle Arthur picks up the canister
of lamp oil and fills the first of the wall-mounted lamps

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - ENTRANCE LOBBY DAY 91

Arthur fills another oil lamp and tests it It comes on

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - KITCHEN DAY 92

Arthur fumbles inside the cooking range It fires up with a
loud WHOOF that startles Spider

ARTHUR
It’s alright old girl It’s just

toasty soon

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - STAIRCASE DAY 93

Arthur marches purposefully upwards carrying a JUG OF
WATER and a handful of CANDLES Close to the top he turns
to see that Spider is still waiting at the foot of the
stair He pats his thigh and reluctantly she follows
93A

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - JUNK ROOM DAY 93A

Arthur drags trunks and boxes out into the hallway

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - BATHROOM DAY 94

Arthur places the jug of water on the wash stand and a
candle in the CANDLESTICK beside it

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - UPPER HALLWAY DAY 95

Arthur pulls the burnt-down CANDLE-ENDS from a wall sconce
and replaces them with fresh candles

That done his eye is drawn to the locked door again
He moves to it tries it one more time It’s still locked
Spider watches head cocked as Arthur produces a bunch of

KEYS and tries every one None work Fighting to keep his
resolute mood he pockets them and makes off down the hall

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - BEDROOM DAY 96

Arthur stands in the doorway to the darkened bedroom He
hesitates then strides in though Spider remains outside

He pauses at the window then grasps the drawn curtains and
yanks them open Relief as he sees no one is outside

He looks over to the fireplace and sees that the baby birds
in the nest are now dead FLIES buzz around them

Arthur’s face falls saddened by the this sight But he
rallies himself and gathers the papers from the bureau

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - UPPER HALLWAY DAY 97

The key is still in the lock on the hallway side of the
bedroom door as when he first visited Papers stuffed
under his arm Arthur locks the door from the outside

EXT STOREHOUSE DAY 98

Arthur emerges from the storehouse carrying an armful of
LOGS and an AXE Spider follows behind

Moments later Arthur is chopping the wood with considerable
aggression releasing some of his pent up nerves

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - MONTAGE DAY 99

A fire blazes in the grate Arthur sits at the writing
desk Spider at his feet the previously-scattered papers
on the desk now in some semblance of order in tall piles

Nearby the trunk and boxes are empty

On the large table behind Arthur are more neat piles of
paperwork

Arthur studies the first DOCUMENT from the pile on the
desk Then he screws it into a ball and tosses it in the
WASTEBASKET

The clock ticks

Arthur studies a PAIR OF DOCUMENTS His look suggests that
finally he has found something useful He places the
documents directly into his suitcase

The fire has burned low Arthur throws on another LOG
Arthur reads a LETTER The pile on the desk is lower too

Another balled-up document lands in the wastebasket

The clock hand CLICKS to the four o’clock mark It CHIMES
four times a nasty hollow chime

Arthur takes a SANDWICH and a bottle of BEER from the lunch
sack He opens the beer and takes a swig As he eats
Arthur continues to go through the papers Opening a large
ENVELOPE he finds a bundle of BIRTHDAY CARDS

Arthur flips through a few and we see that they belonged
to Nathaniel Drablow The last one in the pile reads

“TO OUR DARLING NATHANIEL HAPPY 7th BIRTHDAY WITH LOTS OF
LOVE FROM MUMMY AND DADDY”

Arthur puts down the sandwich his appetite lost He
carefully places the cards back in the envelope

The clock ticks

Arthur reads files and disposes of more documents

The fire in the grate gutters and goes out

The hands of the clock click into place Ten to five
The pile of papers has diminished considerably but a
daunting amount remains A weary Arthur looks up at the

clock then back down to the remaining stacks of papers

He reaches for another tattered ENVELOPE on the pile It
contains TWO DEATH CERTIFICATES

The first reads
“NATHANIEL DRABLOW AGE SEVEN CAUSE OF DEATH DROWNING”

Arthur puts it aside hastily Not wanting to think about it
more than necessary He reads the next

JENNET HUMFRYE AGE THIRTY CAUSE OF DEATH SELF-MURDER
As Arthur studies this a SHADOW sweeps across the paper
like someone outside is passing across the window behind

Arthur

He wheels around alarmed But there’s no one outside and
he’s quite alone in the room

He leaps to the window and peers out
No one to be seen in any direction
Regardless Arthur gets up and leaves followed by an eager

Spider

EXT EEL MARSH HOUSE DAY

Arthur looks around The grounds are deserted
As he gazes down the driveway contemplating heading back
inside Spider looks up at him optimistically - obviously
hoping for a walk
Arthur sighs
ARTHUR
Come on then Just a quick walk

EXT EEL MARSH HOUSE - GRAVEYARD DAY 100

Arthur wanders the silent graveyard with Spider He glances
around anxiously But there’s no one here

He scans the names on the HEADSTONES Most have been worn
away by time and the salty air but soon he finds a newer
one marked “JENNET HUMFRYE - DEAR SISTER OF ALICE
DRABLOW”

Nearby another newer addition a MONUMENT bearing a simple
stone cross The plaque reads

“IN MEMORY OF JOHN KECKWICK SR - 20 YEARS OF LOYAL SERVICE TO
THE DRABLOW FAMILY TAKEN FROM US TOO SOON”

Arthur turns noticing now a STATUE behind him close by a
disquieting STONE ANGEL with a worn-away face Arthur bends
to read the inscription

It reads IN LOVING MEMORY OF NATHANIEL DRABLOW August 2nd
1863 - December 29th 1871”

The rest reads “Beloved son of Alice and Charles Drablow

However someone has attempted to SCRATCH OUT this last
portion

Arthur moves away deeply unsettled by this

OS Spider begins to BARK

OMITTED 101

EXT EEL MARSH HOUSE - GROUNDS DAY 102

As Arthur retuns to the path he soon sees Spider facing
the causeway barking furiously

And we hear the same distinct sound of CHILDREN’S VOICES
that he heard earlier

But just as earlier there are no children to be seen
And suddenly as if sensing - as before - that someone else
is nearby watching him Arthur turns uneasily to look back

toward the house

In the upper window he sees The Woman in Black Looking
out towards the causeway

Arthur starts back toward the house moving fast
purposefully Spider at his heels

OMITTED 103

EXT EEL MARSH HOUSE DUSK 104

The sun is low in the sky Arthur and Spider walk towards
the house their long shadows playing across the drive

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL DUSK

Arthur makes for the stairs

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - UPPER HALL DUSK

Arthur hesitates for a moment getting his bearings
calculating which window belongs to which room

Then swiftly he moves towards the box room calling out

ARTHUR
Hello

INT BOX-ROOM DUSK

Arthur enters cautiously But it’s just as he last saw it No
one here Nothing has been touched

He steps to the window sits down on the window seat and
looks out across the marsh

EXT EEL MARSH HOUSE DUSK

From outside we now see Arthur at the window - the same
window at which we previously saw the Woman in Black

After a moment he steps away out of sight

105 INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM NIGHT 105

Arthur is hard at work going through the papers

The fire burns in the grate the windows are shuttered and
the room is lit by the oil lamps And yet somehow there is
nothing cosy about this room

He pulls out a desk drawer from the desk and empties out its
contents begins to shuffle the loose papers into a stack

Among the debris SEVERAL PHOTOGRAPHS Most are of Nathaniel
Drablow and his parents

Arthur leafs through them quickly only mildly interested --
this after all is not what he’s here for

Arthur begins to replace the drawer in the desk but after
going in a short way it sticks

He pushes it jiggles it But no Something is blocking it

Arthur removes the drawer again puts his hand inside the
desk to feel for the obstruction

He reacts as he feels something stuck to the underside of
the desk Deliberately concealed He pulls it free

A collection of DOCUMENTS bound with a black ribbon

Arthur unties the ribbon unfolds the first document It
reads

“CERTIFICATE OF ADOPTION”

As Arthur scans it we clearly see the typed words

“NATHANIEL”

“ADOPTIVE PARENTS ALICE AND CHARLES DRABLOW”

“BIRTH MOTHER JENNET HUMFRYE”

The silence is suddenly broken as Spider leaps up and BARKS

Seconds later we register another noise an intermittent
BUMPING rumbling sound

Spider runs to the drawing-room door and stands there hair
on end growling

Afraid now but trying to suppress his fear Arthur rises

and gingerly opens the door realising immediately and to
his great dismay that the sound is coming from upstairs

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - STAIRCASE NIGHT 106

Arthur mounts the stairs The upstairs hallway is in near
darkness illuminated only by the dim light from the oil
lamps in the downstairs entrance lobby

Again Spider remains at the foot of the staircase Arthur
looks back pats his thigh But Spider doesn’t move

Arthur continues up the stairs alone

But now the bumping noise STOPS Silence

Arthur pauses on the stairs Wonders now whether he imagined
it Decides to wait to see whether it will start again But

as he stands here he notices

The framed photograph of Eel Marsh House he saw earlier The
three Drablows standing before it Something about the

picture that Arthur hadn’t seen before --

In the upper window the Woman in Black is clearly visible

Arthur hurries back down the stairs

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM NIGHT

Arthur seizes the envelope of photographs and tips them out
onto the desk

In several photographs of the Drablow family or of Nathaniel
on his own the Woman in Black is somewhere in the

background

But Arthur barely has time to react before from upstairs
the BUMPING sound begins again

Arthur leaps to his feet and heads for the door

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - UPPER HALLWAY NIGHT 107

Arthur arrives at the upstairs corridor The sound is much
louder here

It is patently coming from behind the locked door

Arthur strikes a MATCH and lights the candles in the wall
sconce Their weak light makes precious little difference

The noise continues as Arthur approaches the locked room

Standing outside the door now the rhythmic bumping sound
from within is ridiculously loud absurdly clear

A breath and then Arthur’s hand shoots out and grabs for
the handle The door is still locked fast

He kicks at the door It won’t open The noise continues

EXT EEL MARSH HOUSE NIGHT 112

Arthur exits the house into the pitch black night a
LANTERN in his hand Spider yapping noisily at his heels

The drive is deserted He heads for the East of the house

INT STOREHOUSE NIGHT 113

In the storehouse containers CLATTER to the ground and
Spider yaps as Arthur fumbles in the clutter for the axe

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - ENTRANCE LOBBY NIGHT 114

Arthur downs the lantern bolts the front door and with
determination and axe in hand heads for the stairs

Upstairs the rumbling from the locked room continues

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - STAIRCASE NIGHT 115

This time Arthur doesn’t even stop to acknowledge that
Spider has stopped following him He marches on shouting
up the stairs as he approaches wielding the axe

ARTHUR
Enough

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - UPPER HALLWAY NIGHT 116

Arthur keeps going the noise louder as he enters the hall

ARTHUR
Enough of that bloody noise
Arthur’s words die on his lips and he stops in his tracks

The door at the end of the corridor is now open

Arthur lowers the axe in shock Then he seizes a candle
from one of the wall sconces raises the axe again and
walks towards the open door

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - NURSERY NIGHT 117

The room is in complete darkness but the noise continues

Arthur steps in and breathing unevenly shines the small
pool of candle-light around the room with an unsteady hand

A BED BOOKS A TOY-BOX TOYS DOLLS Some disconcerting
AUTOMATA - mechanical monkeys in finery protected under
glass domes

This is a nursery And in stark contrast to the rest of the
house it is immaculate

Finally by the fireplace Arthur at last sees the source
of the noise a ROCKING CHAIR Its rocking Hard but with
decreasing speed as if very recently vacated
Arthur reaches out nervously and steadies it into silence
ARTHUR
(whispering)
Who’s there

Arthur looks frantically behind him No one

Spying a WARDROBE big enough to conceal a person he pulls
its doors open But there are only children’s clothes here

Arthur studies them Touches them Row upon row of expensive
beautifully-made garments

Folded piles of neatly starched and ironed undershirts
Little pairs of polished shoes lined up side by side

A neat row of wooden hangers bearing day clothes formal
clothes play clothes Little suits A smart little coat

Arthur picks up a small SAILOR JACKET in both hands his
fear replaced by a sense of sadness

Slowly he now moves around the room touching the toys
the army of LEAD SOLDIERS a beautiful TEDDY BEAR

He turns the key on one of the automata a MONKEY PIANIST
Then another an ACROBAT And another Until the whole
shelf is alive with movement and the room filled with a
cacophony of different MELODIES

With a heavy heart Arthur places the candle on the
nightstand and sits down on the little bed his head in his
hands

Finally he gathers himself and stands to leave But as he
reaches for the candle he notices

The bright circle of light has illuminated something strange
about the wall behind the bed

Where two sheets of patterned wallpaper meet here there is a
distinct difference in shade

Arthur investigates further

He definitely hasn’t imagined this The wallpaper around the
nursery is faded by age but two sheets of it -- the sheets
behind the bed -- are newer The same pattern perfectly
lined-up but almost certainly replaced at some later date

Compelled by curiosity and some grim unknowable instinct
Arthur runs his fingernail under the edge of one of the newer
sheets of wallpaper

He peels a small section a little way back
Underneath the same wallpaper but faded Matching the paper

beside it the paper around the remainder of the room
Someone has covered something up

Arthur peels off a little more of the wall paper
Nothing

In the background each mechanical tune from the automata
slows to a discordant stop Silence now as Arthur tears a

little further revealing --

A BLACK MARK Staining the faded wallpaper beneath the fresh
one What is it

With a little more urgency Arthur scrabbles at the paper
around the black mark revealing enough that we see

It’s a LETTER “Y” Daubed on the paper in black paint

Now in earnest Arthur sets about revealing what else is
hidden

Arthur’s nails claw at the paper

We see snatches of black paint more letters

Torn paper drops onto the floor the bed

Finally Arthur staggers back and looks on in mute horror at
what he has revealed

Defacing the pale wallpaper above the bed a crudely daubed
message lettered in dripping black paint --

“YOU COULD HAVE SAVED HIM”

Arthur stumbles out of the room

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - UPPER HALL - NIGHT

As Arthur enters the hall he becomes aware that something is
different out here He looks around cautiously What is it

The Box Room The door is open The interior lit now by
candle-light

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - BOX ROOM NIGHT

Arthur steps inside just the sound of his breathing now
Afraid of what he might see

Immediately the source of the light becomes apparent --

On the window-seat someone has placed a CANDLE HOLDER The
candle is lit

Arthur’s eyes dart around the room But there’s no one here
He’s alone

He moves towards the window seat and sits down slowly beside
the candle trying to take all of this in

Finally he picks up the candle and stands to leave As he
does so the surface of the window seat makes a bang like
the lid of a hinged chest

Arthur looks behind him stares at it curious He grabs the
window seat to find that it is indeed hinged - it lifts
easily He opens it

He peers down into the dark recessed space There are things
in here but it’s too dark at first to see exactly what

Arthur moves the candle closer and sees --
This is some kind of SHRINE

Propped against the back wall in the centre a photograph of
Nathaniel Drablow Surrounding it a few sad time-worn
relics a neatly folded blue BABY BLANKET a pair of tiny
knitted BOOTIES a single TOY SOLDIER a child’s drawing a
stack of envelopes

Arthur picks up the drawing It depicts A WOMAN Scrawled
above the image the words
“TO AUNTIE JENNET FROM NATHANIEL”

Arthur replaces it and studies the envelopes now Brown with
age and apparently never opened

Carefully Arthur opens one at random Inside A BIRTHDAY
CARD

He opens the card Reads the inscription
“DARLING NATHANIEL HAPPY 3RD BIRTHDAY ALL MY LOVE MUMMY”
Arthur opens another envelope Another card

“FOR MY LITTLE MAN HAPPY 4TH BIRTHDAY DARLING ALL MY LOVE
MUMMY”

Arthur opens the last card in the stack

“FOR MY LITTLE NATHANIEL ON HIS 7TH BIRTHDAY WITH SO MUCH
LOVE FROM MUMMY xxxx”

As Arthur studies this last card he becomes aware that he
can faintly hear something Hooves and Wheels Far away on
the causeway

He replaces the card with the others closes the lid of the
window seat and kneels up close to the window He looks out

There’s a light mist outside now hanging above the marshes
making it hard to see the causeway in any detail

The sound grows louder
And far out close to the hazy outline of the distant cross
in the marshes we now see glimpses of an approaching PONY

AND TRAP

And now Arthur hears the same catastrophic sounds that he
heard before - first a CLATTERING

Through the mist we see snatches of the trap as it veers off
the causeway

The Pony WHINNIES The Man Woman and Child CRY OUT

WOMAN
Keckwick

Distant flash of hooves eyes and teeth through the mist and
darkness as the pony struggles fruitlessly to free itself
from the marsh

Arthur can’t bear to watch but he can’t look away

Outside through the mist we see the trap nearly submerged
in the marsh

The Woman gathers her skirts and climbs up onto the frame of
the trap

Mist obscures our view now but seconds later we hear a THUMP
and we see

The woman has jumped to safety Landing heavily on the
causeway

A child’s hand reaches out screaming

CHILD
Mummy

Now Arthur closes his eyes covers his ears unable to stand
any more

Outside there’s a terrible SUCKING churning noise And
finally an even more terrible SILENCE

When Arthur opens his eyes and looks reluctantly out of the
window he is shocked to see

The mist has GONE

The marshes and the causeway are clear deserted The moon
bright

Arthur rests his forehead against the window pane his head
spinning

His breath mists the window pane

In the cloud of condensation FINGERTIPS appear Small
dainty the mark of a woman’s fingertips pressed against the
glass long ago

A sickening realisation Arthur whispers

ARTHUR
Oh Jennet You saw it happen

118-120 OMITTED 118-120

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - BATHROOM NIGHT 108

Arthur enters It’s pitch black the view from the window
brighter than the room within - the tide out the causeway
and mirror-like surface of the marshes lit by the moon

Arthur strikes a match and lights the candle on the
washstand the view obscured now the window glass reflecting
the interior of the bathroom instead

Pouring some of the water from the jug into the basin Arthur
splashes his face

ARTHUR
Come on Arthur

Wiping his brow dry with his sleeve he peers at his
reflection in the window behind the washstand

Then something outside catches his attention Arthur presses
his face closer to the window

EXT THE MARSHES NIGHT 109

From Arthur’s POV we see the distant view of the marshes
Far away in the previously smooth surface beneath the wooden
cross there now seems to be a tiny irregular BUMP

Intercutting we see Arthur react in horror

There is definitely a bump now And it seems to be growing
rising out of the marshes

Despite the distance it soon becomes apparent that it is
unmistakably a SMALL HUMAN FIGURE covered in mud

Now fully risen it stands motionless under the moonlight for

a few moments before beginning to lumber awkwardly towards
the house

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - BATHROOM NIGHT 110

Arthur involuntarily takes a step back from the window away
from the approaching figure but then he rallies himself

He turns away shakes his head as if trying to shake sense
into himself He cannot possibly be seeing this It must be
his imagination

And indeed when he turns and looks through the window again

The figure is no longer there

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - DRAWING-ROOM NIGHT 121

Arthur drains a large glass of brandy as outside rain
falls noisily There is a distant rumble of thunder

He looks again at the bundle of documents that were hidden
The rest of the pile seems to consist mostly of LETTERS

The signature on the topmost letter catches Arthur’s eye
JENNET He tears off the ribbon and begins to read

As he leafs through them we see flashes of text

“Dear Sister”

“Dear Alice”

“Out of wedlock”

“our father insists”

“If you let me stay I swear never to tell him”
“But he is mine and can never be yours”

Arthur’s eye lingers on the letter containing this last
unsettling statement

He puts the letters down and picks up one of the photographs
he discarded earlier

Nathaniel And in the background Jennet Pain and longing
writ large on her face

Instinctively Arthur reaches towards the photograph
But just as his fingertips are about to make contact the
silence is shattered by a loud series of KNOCKS at the front

door Arthur freezes

Silence Then another knock

122-129 OMITTED 122-129

INT ENTRANCE LOBBY NIGHT 130

Arthur slowly approaches the door Spider is there already
hackles up a low steady GROWL coming from her throat

Another loud knock makes Arthur flinch

ARTHUR
Who’s there

Arthur reaches the door From the other side we faintly
hear a CHILD SOBBING over the sound of the torrential rain

Arthur puts his ear to the door The sobbing continues
Then another knock

Arthur backs away but the weeping continues until finally
unable to ignore it any longer he opens the door

Nothing Just darkness And rain battering the driveway

But Arthur has barely had a chance to register his relief
when Spider bolts out past him and runs down the drive

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Spider Here Spider SPIDER

Arthur walks out into the night

EXT EEL MARSH HOUSE - GROUNDS NIGHT 131

A full-blown storm is raging now Arthur ranges around in
the rain drenched but the dog is nowhere to be seen

ARTHUR
Spider

He keeps moving but slows to a halt when he hears
louder than when he heard them last the soft chattering
voices of CHILDREN

And this time when he looks out toward the causeway Arthur
sees just faintly through the darkness and rain

A GROUP OF CHILDREN standing motionless by the edge of the
marsh

He freezes Is he really seeing this

But the group of small figures stay in plain view
Unsettling Incongruous The sound of their voices continues

And to his queasy concern he realises

They are walking slowly towards him

A lightning flash and for a second they are illuminated
They are indeed children but there’s something not right
about them

Once again there is darkness

Then another flash

They are coming closer now And in the light we and Arthur
can now make out more detail

Some of the children look sickly others injured Several
appear to be victims of drowning their hair wet faces
bloated and decayed

Arthur remains rooted to the spot

Darkness

Then a double fork of lightning

Now the children are close enough for Arthur to see that

among their number is Victoria Hardy chin and dress
stained with a long steak of dark bloody vomit

Finally Arthur turns and runs

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - ENTRANCE LOBBY NIGHT 132

Arthur slams the front door and throws his back against it
drenched and gasping for breath

He sweeps his hair from his eyes and looks up to see

A single set of little muddy FOOTPRINTS They lead all the
way from the front door to the staircase

-and up the stairs into the darkness of the upper hall
Gripped by terror and compulsion in equal measure Arthur

picks up the lantern he abandoned earlier beside the door
and begins to follow the trail

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - UPPER HALL NIGHT 133

Breathing hard Arthur stops at the top of the stairs and
shines his lantern down the darkened hallway

The light from the lantern quivers with the trembling of
his hand and throws shadows down the hall but even so we
can see where the trail leads

Down the corridor it goes And all the way to the slightly
open door of the nursery

Only a dim light spills from within the single candle that
Arthur left burning on the night stand

Clearly audible the sound of THE ROCKING CHAIR

No turning back now Arthur continues down the dark hall
But as he nears the open door he is shocked by a burst of
MUSIC the kind made by the automata

Arthur pushes the door open a little further

Within the circular pool of candlelight on the wall two

distinct shadows are moving gently the rocking chair
tipping back and forth And a woman hanging by her neck

An otherworldly breeze blows through the hallway and the
candles gutter and die leaving only the light from Arthurs
lantern and the splash of candle-light beyond the door with
it’s horrifying shadows

Then that light gutters too leaving Arthur marooned in the
weak glow of his lantern with the sound of the rocking chair
and the mechanical music

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - NURSERY NIGHT 134

Arthur steps inside Even in the darkness we can see the
nursery has been vandalized The bed overturned broken
toys and clothes scattered everything covered in mud

With his lantern Arthur illuminates first one spot then
another in jerky urgent succession

As he streaks his light across the ceiling we see that the
low cross-beam is bare No one hanging here Not now anyway

Arthur touches the rocking chair stills it And we may
realise now that its position beneath the cross-beam suggests
an entirely more sinister reason for its movement than we
previously thought

Now just the broken mechanical music remains

On the ground Arthur quickly finds the source an
automaton - the monkey pianist - lies on its side
surrounded by the shattered glass from its protective dome
No longer in contact with its piano the movements of its
mouth head and arms give it the grotesque appearance of
something injured echoes of the baby bird

Arthur finds the CATCH that turns it off and finally the
toy is still the music silenced

The muddy footprints cover the ground impossible to follow
now The intruder could be anywhere

Arthur moves his lantern slowly across the back wall
illuminating the awful painted words Nothing here

Behind him he hears a scuttling movement

Arthur swings round and in the light from the lantern we
catch for just a moment the briefest glimpse of something
inhuman-looking

His hand shaking Arthur brings the light back A streak of
movement again as the moving thing quickly ducks down behind

a chest of drawers It is small and entirely covered in mud -
little more than a flash of eyes in the darkness - but
unmistakably a CHILD

Trembling Arthur trains the lantern onto the chest The
eyes peer back at Arthur

Arthur inches closer his breath loud The figure doesn’t
move

But just as he reaches the chest the lantern goes out

Total darkness as we hear Arthur lurching out of the room

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - BATHROOM NIGHT 135

The candle on the washstand has blown out but the
moonlight outside allows us to see again albeit dimly

Arthur fumbles for a match and lights the candle

Revealing the child Somehow he’s here now Crouched
behind the washstand

Reacting in shock Arthur turns and bolts into the hallway

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - UPPER HALL - NIGHT 136

Arthur darts towards the bedroom next door and fumbles
desperately with the key in the lock

Glancing anxiously over his shoulder he looks back to see

The silhouette of the muddy child casting a long thin
SHADOW down the hallway behind him

Finally getting the bedroom door open Arthur grabs the key
from the lock and hurries inside

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - BEDROOM NIGHT 137

In here we can still hear the FLIES in the fireplace

Arthur slams the door shut and scrabbles to insert the key
and lock himself in

This done he pushes the dresser across the door and slumps
to the floor fighting to catch his breath

But to his utter dismay he now sees
Little muddy FOOTPRINTS on the floor
They lead right to the bed

And in the bed is the unmistakable shape of someone small
hidden beneath the covers

As Arthur stares frozen in horror we see a mud stain
slowly spreading across the white sheet

Then the shape begins to sit up
Arthur darts to the door struggling to move the dresser
groping for the key in his pocket as behind him the

figure in the bed continues to heave itself upright

Finally he gets the door open and runs into the corridor

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - UPPER HALL - NIGHT 138

-Only to be confronted by the mud-covered child standing
right before him blocking his path The child’s mouth is
open the flash of his eyes and little white teeth
disconcertingly bright in the darkness of the hall

Arthur cries out and pushes blindly past the child toward
the stairs

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - ENTRANCE LOBBY NIGHT 139

Arthur virtually falls down the last few steps of the
staircase into the entrance hall but he keeps his balance
and dashes toward the front door

But just as he reaches out to open it he is scared out of
his wits by another KNOCK at the door

ARTHUR
Leave me ALONE

This time we hear a voice clearly on the other side
DAILY (0S)

Arthur Arthur It’s me Sam

INT DAILYS CARCAUSEWAY NIGHT 140

The tide is out now and Daily drives Arthur across the
causeway through the storm back towards safety

Spider is on Arthurs lap Arthur strokes her and stares
straight ahead a haunted look on his face

DAILY
(re Spider)
She must’ve recognised the sound of
my engine from more’n a mile away
you know Right over the other side
of the causeway she was Running
to meet me

ARTHUR
You don’t believe me do you

DAILY
I believe that even the most
rational mind can play tricks in
the dark

ARTHUR
(frustrated)

This wasn’t

ARTHUR (CONTD)
If Mrs Drablow endured a fraction
of what I just experienced I can
fully understand why she’d leave
for India at the earliest
opportunity and never return

They drive on in slightly tense silence Then

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Did you know why Jennet Humfrye
committed suicide

Daily nods

DAILY
Crythin Gifford’s a small place
Everyone suspected the boy was
hers And that accident -- terrible
business Mrs Drablow was the only
survivor Weren’t even able to
recover the bodies The boy and the
driver Still out there they
are

But something is bothering Arthur

ARTHUR
Who are the children Sam

Daily rounds on him stunned
DAILY
Why What’s wrong with you Why
would you say something like that

ARTHUR
I saw children On the marshes

DAILY
No No more ghost stories No more
lies

ARTHUR

(angry now)
I’m not lying I saw them Sam
Sick children Drowned children
Children who are dead

DAILY
My wife telling you tales
(louder now)
Was she

For the first time we sense Daily’s bluff exterior melt away
as he reacts slumping in the driver’s seat

Arthur shrinks away from him guilty and uneasy at having
touched such a raw nerve

They drive on in awkward silence
The car takes a right turn onto Jerome’s street
Suddenly
DAILY (CONTD)
What in the name Do you see

that

Grey smoke is billowing down the street towards them They
slow down the smoke obscuring their view as drive on

We can hear VOICES COMMOTION and a little way ahead we
can see FLAMES Arthur peers into the smoke

ARTHUR
Jesus

Daily brings the car to a stop and the two get out

EXT JEROMES OFFICE NIGHT 160

The two men walk through the cloud of smoke to find Mrs
Jerome in her night clothes hysterical being held back by
the post-mistress and Mrs Fisher

Jerome’s building is ON FIRE

Gerald Hardy PC Collins Fisher and the other village men
we met earlier fruitlessly throw PAILS OF WATER onto the
blaze and run off to fetch more Other BYSTANDERS look on

Keckwick emerges from the front door of the burning building
dragging a semi-conscious Jerome

Mrs Jerome reacts in anguish but it’s not just this sight
that is distressing her

MRS JEROME
LucY

Arthur’s face reveals his horrible dawning realization
He rushes towards the open door to Jerome’s office and

moves headlong into the thick smoke

INT JEROME’S CELLARCELLAR STAIRWELL DAY 161

Arthur fights his way through the smoke a HANDKERCHIEF
clamped over his mouth He pulls open the cellar door

Inside the wood-beamed ceiling is on fire fed by a tower
of flames issuing from what seems to be a sizeable BONFIRE
in the centre of the room

Through the smoke and heat-haze Arthur can just make out
the pale girl Jerome’s daughter motionless in a corner

The girl watches as Arthur inches closer

ARTHUR
Come to me

He reaches his hand out to her The girl takes a single
step forward eyes still trained on Arthur

ARTHUR (CONT’D)
That’s it come on Come to me

Closer now Arthur can clearly see the source of the fire
the bed has been dragged to the centre of the room other
furniture has been piled on top of it and all of it has

been set alight This was no accident The girl did this

Arthur struggles to take in what he is seeing He looks
back to the girl meeting her calm unemotional gaze

As Arthur tries to comprehend this the girl’s eyes finally
leave his and she looks to the opposite side of the room

Arthur snaps his head round to see
The Woman in Black She gives the child a firm nod
Arthur watches in mute horror as the girl nods back

Then slowly purposefully launches herself onto the pyre

ARTHUR (CONTD)
NO

He runs forward but is beaten back by the heat and smoke
We share Arthur’s dreadful POV as she’s consumed by flames

A beam crashes down from above and catches light The
ceiling is coming down

Arthur turns and runs for the door

EXT JEROME’S OFFICE NIGHT 162

As Arthur bursts out onto the street gasping for air
Daily rushes forward to help steady him lead him away

From inside a colossal CRASH as the ceiling collapses

A still-hysterical Mrs Jerome
the Fishers are attending to

and several others including
the still semi-conscious

Jerome None of them notice Arthur --

Except Mrs Fisher She walks
something But before she can
pulls her away

Fisher says something to her

towards him wanting to say
Fisher seizes her arm and

that we can’t hear above the

noise and she shouts something back that makes him angrily

release her arm and walk away
She follows but looks back a

Coming round Jerome surveys

to Jerome’s side

t Arthur with sorrow

the crowd groggily but when

his gaze finds Arthur his expression hardens

When he speaks his voice is cracked and altered rasping
through scorched lungs

JEROME
See what you’ve done

Mrs Jerome continues to scream

INT DAILY’S HOUSE - BEDROOM DAWN 163

Arthur removes his blackened jacket and hangs it on the
back of a chair then - a thought - he digs into the inner
pocket He is relieved to find Joseph’s calendar undamaged

It is open to the page marked “Thursday”
There is a knock at the door

DAILY (0S)
Arthur

Arthur opens the door to find Daily holding a cup of cocoa

DAILY (CONTD)
Just wanted to see if you were
alright Brought you this too
if you want it

Slightly embarrassed Daily hands Arthur the cup He takes
it silently and sits down on the bed still shell-shocked

DAILY (CONTD)
Always used to give Nicholas
cocoa when things were bad
(attempting levity)
I put some rum in yours though

Arthur puts the cup down loudly on the nightstand and
explodes unable to keep up this pretence at normality

ARTHUR
She was there Sam Jennet
Humfrye
Daily bristles
DAILY

For gods sake Jennet Humfrye is
dead You said yourself the girl
started the fire Being locked
down there must have driven her
out of her mind

ARTHUR
No I don’t think she’d been down
there that long Just since I
arrived Threatening to disturb
the status quo Jerome was
trying to keep her safe

Daily’s expression suggests that Arthur is onto something
DAILY
God only knows what nonsense that

madman believes

ARTHUR
You heard what he said to me

Daily stands up distraught and irate
DAILY

If you want to discuss old wives

tales Arthur find yourself an

old wife
Arthur opens his mouth to protest but Daily is already
gone storming out of the room slamming the door behind
him leaving Arthur stunned and alone

He lies on the bed more confused and troubled than ever

His eye wanders to the painting hanging opposite the bed --
the four little boys wading at the beach

Seeing it again now he notices the female figure watching
the children Not a mother Her dark clothes the familiar
shape of her silhouette Suddenly this scene has taken on
an altogether different and more malevolent atmosphere

And something clicks

MONTAGE - 164

Queasy flash cuts as Arthur remembers

- the nursery room at the Gifford Arms the with the old
rocking horse hidden under its sheet
- Gerald Hardy pulling his children away from the fence
- the very young children at the window barricaded indoors
- Jerome’s daughter scuttling away from the cellar door

- Victoria Hardy and the other ghostly children lit by
lightning in the storm

- The row of graves in the churchyard We now see clearly
that several share the same date of death - May 23rd 1872

EXT DAILY’S MAUSOLEUM DAY 167

Arthur runs to the engraved EPITAPH his eyes darting to
the last line where he finds exactly what he expected

- MAY 23RD 1872

Arthur runs his fingers over the letters then sensing that
he is being watched looks up to see --

Mrs Daily Standing a few feet away in her nightclothes
watching him A portable EASEL in her hand PAPER and
CHARCOAL balanced on it Arthur reacts in shock

MRS DAILY
I didn’t mean to give you a
start Mr Kipps Just came down
to sketch Sometimes me and
Nicholas sketch together

Collecting himself now Arthur faces her determined

An identical scene real now NICHOLAS DAILY and his friends
wading in the sea

Only they’re not wading Just walking straight ahead as if
hypnotised Deeper and deeper into the sea Fully clothed

Waist deep Chest deep Shoulder deep

And then gone Submerged beneath the waves

EXT DAILY’S MAUSOLEUM DAY

Arthur is lost for words

MRS DAILY
Nicholas says she’s trapped
Looking for her son never
finding him Nicholas says it
makes her angry

She reaches out touches Arthur’s arm

You mustn’t blame yourself You
didn’t know Jerome should
understand that better than most

staying away Jerome knew and he
didn’t listen After Nicholas and
his friends no one went to the

Took buyers from all over the
county She was there of course

vomit stains her chin and the front of her dress

She stares straight at him even as her eyes take on the
milky glaze of death

EXT EEL MARSH ISLAND NIGHT 179

Lightning illuminates the wraithlike children on the marsh
Close and in horrible detail as Arthur last saw them

EXT DAILY’S MAUSOLEUM DAY 180

Mrs Daily is still facing the mausoleum panting fast now
Arthur’s breathing quickens too in panic She’s having
another “episode” and he knows he should get help but he’s
grimly compelled to stay To know

ARTHUR
On the marshes

MRS DAILY
On the marshes between the worlds
(a beat then fearful)
I’m so cold

Then without warning Mrs Daily moves sharply grabbing a
piece of charcoal from her easel Her hands now stiff claws
she clutches the charcoal close to her looking increasingly
out of control

Arthur reaches out and tries to calm her but she struggles
free and begins to scribble crazily with the charcoal on the
side of the mausoleum

This has gone far enough Arthur turns and runs into the
avenue of trees shouting ahead

ARTHUR
Mr Daily Sam

EXT DAILY’S HOUSE DAY 181

As Arthur nears the house he is met by Mr Daily and the
Butler already running towards him

EXT DAILY’S MAUSOLEUM DAY 182

Mr Daily struggles to hold his wife while the Butler
attempts to administer medication Arthur stands back
awkwardly wanting to help too but having to dodge Mrs
Daily’s flailing arms and legs

Finally the butler gives her a slug of the medication and
she relaxes into Daily’s arms He lifts her up and begins
to stagger down the avenue of trees towards the house

Arthur follows behind them Silence now just the birds

Arthur turns to look back at the mausoleum He stops
paralysed by what he sees

On the side of the mausoleum is the word FRIDAY And drawn
above it in a childlike style a man a child a train

A perfect replica of the final page of Josephs calendar

INTEXT DAILY’S CARCOUNTRY LANES DAWN 184

There’s a purposeful air to proceedings as Arthur and Daily
drive fast down the lane that leads to Jerome’s street

Arthur has his pocket watch open in his hand

DAILY
As long as the telegram reaches
your house no later than half past
twelve They’1l not leave before
then I’m sure

Arthur’s anger has been simmering beneath his fear hearing
Daily’s undisguised concern brings it to a sudden boil

ARTHUR
How could you do it Sam Knowing
I had a son How could you take
me to Eel Marsh if there was even
a small part of you that feared
the stories were true

DAILY
I never believed

ARTHUR
You didn’t want to There’s a
difference

They turn into Jerome’s street

DAILY
I can know that Nicholas is ina
better place waiting for us to
one day be reunited Or that he
is lost Which would you choose

ARTHUR
Forgive me Sam but my son is
alive How could I chance that by
letting him come here I might
condemn him to death

Daily doesn’t reply His attention is on something outside
He stops the car and his head slumps against the window

ARTHUR (CONTD)

The Post office located right next to Jerome’s office has
been entirely gutted in last night’s fire

The two men sit in the stationary car Now what

DAILY
The next village is more than an
hour away

Arthur looks down at his watch First at the clock face
and then at Stella’s portrait He stares at it the
reminder of his first loss almost too much to bear in the
face of the unthinkable prospect of another

Daily just stares straight ahead The grimmest of silences
And then Arthur’s expression changes he’s had an idea

ARTHUR
What time is the tide back out

DAILY
Not until five Why

Arthur’s mind ticks over This could work Besides it’s his
only chance

ARTHUR
We can’t stop Joseph So we

must stop her

ARTHUR (CONTD)

If we can reunite Jennet Humfrye
with her son perhaps she’1l
finally be at peace

(off his silence)
I’m not asking you to change your
beliefs I’m talking about a
proper burial

Arthur if every man-jack before us
failed to recover his body how in
god’s name do you think we’1ll
succeed now

ARTHUR

Because you have something that
the others never did

EXT DAILY’S CARNINE LIVES CAUSEWAY NIGHT 187

The car has stopped its engine idling and Arthur is tying
a length of ROPE to the rear bumper He tugs at it to test
the strength of his knot then gives Daily - still seated
in the drivers seat - a nod

Now holding the lose end of the rope in one hand Arthur
gingerly steps first one foot then the other off the
causeway and onto the marsh

Immediately he begins to sink Panicking he leaps back
onto the causeway

Determined he steps off again and this time begins to run
his feet in contact with the ground as briefly as possible

Bar a couple of dicey moments he successfully reaches the
large wooden cross

Even as he clings to it however he begins to sink He
waves to Daily putting on a brave face

Daily waves back but can’t hide his anxiety

Arthur is now knee deep in the marsh and we realise that
he is deliberately allowing himself to be drawn down

He begins to flounder in the mud clutching the rope
plunging his free hand beneath the surface and scrabbling
urgently to feel for any sign of the pony trap

Lower and lower Arthur goes at a frightening speed - thigh-
deep waist-deep chest deep - fighting to stay calm
feeling around for anything solid beneath him

Finally his face lights up

ARTHUR
Sam I feel it It’s beneath my
feet

Arthur’s arms and shoulders vanish into the mud He tips
his head back taking a few last deep breaths

And finally Arthur’s head disappears from view

188 INT DAILY’S CAR NIGHT 188

From behind the wheel Daily looks back over his shoulder
watching desperate

After a short time that still feels too long he turns
back shifts the gear-stick and begins to drive

WHINES of straining protest issue from the engine

189 EXT DAILY’S CARNINE LIVES CAUSEWAY NIGHT 189

The engine continues to whine as the rope becomes taut

At last Arthur emerges from the marsh coated entirely in
mud clinging to the rope choking for breath

Suddenly he begins to sink again

ARTHUR
Keep driving

Even from this distance the noise from the engine is loud
and clearly not healthy But the car continues to creep
forward although we sense it can barely take the strain

Finally the other end of the rope emerges from the mud
and we see a KNOT tied around the brace of A TRAP

ARTHUR (CONT’D)
Don’t stop

The wheels on the automobile begin to spin losing traction
as the weight becomes too much

But with another burst of acceleration the front end of
the trap rises from the marsh A nightmarish contraption
rotted and skeletal silhouetted against the wide open sky

Arthur - and back behind the wheel Daily - stare at it in
horror and awe

Arthur clambers on to it leans in and shouts at Daily to
continue but now the wheels are just grinding fruitlessly

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Can you go any further

DAILY
The pedal is on the floor I
don’t think she can take any more
weight

But there is one last burst of acceleration

The trap rises again And inches from Arthur a HUMAN
HEAD emerges from the marsh surface It is alarmingly well-
preserved by the conditions in the marsh almost mummified
beneath the layer of mud

Arthur startles but composes himself and calls to Daily
ARTHUR
I think I’ve found Keckwick

Senior

The wheels continue to spin the engine howls and clanks
and white smoke begins to billow from beneath the bonnet

DAILY
I can’t hear you The engine is
overheating

ARTHUR
Turn it off And apply the brake

Daily complies

There is silence now on the marsh Arthur plunges his arms
into the mud feeling urgently for any sign of the boy

Presently we realise that the trap is beginning to sink
back into the marsh and the car is slowly being dragged
backwards by its weight

ARTHUR (CONTD)
I said apply the brake

DAILY
I have You’re going to have to
hurry

We intercut between the car rolling slowly backwards and
Arthurs efforts on the sinking trap until finally with
little time to spare Arthur grasps something beneath the
surface

With effort he hauls out the remains of Jennets son
Besides his stillness the boy looks much like the mud-
covered child we saw in the house and Arthur struggles to

fight his fear as he gently holds the little body

The car continues to drift backwards closer and closer to
the marsh pulled by the weight of the sinking trap

Cradling the boy with one arm Arthur hauls his way along
the rope back towards the safety of the causeway

He takes a heavy muddy step out of the marshes and onto
the road just in time to turn back and see

The trap sinking back into the marsh Without a trace

The rope slack again the car comes to a stop and Daily
climbs out He recoils at the sight of the child

Arthur looks down at the boy in his arms then looks up at
Daily tears in his eyes For a while neither man speaks

A light mist is beginning to descend Daily looks around

DAILY (CONTD)

There’s a fret brewing Best get
off the causeway while we can
and start digging the plot We
need to be at the station in an
hour

ARTHUR
If you don’t mind making a
start I should take him
indoors Clean him up first

DAILY
You could do with a bit of spit
and polish yourself
Both men try to smile at Daily’s attempt at jocularity but
find it to be nearly impossible

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - BATHROOM NIGHT 191

Arthur - now clean and wearing his clean clothes his hair
wet - holds the boy in his arms beside a BATH full of
water

He tips the boy back into the water their position a
poignant visual reminder of Arthur’s more boisterous
earlier play with his own son

Gently Arthur uses a WASHCLOTH to sponge the mud from the
child’s hair and face

The boy’s eyes are closed and as the mud washes away it
becomes apparent just how well the conditions in the marsh
have kept him preserved over the years

Arthur stares at him with a mixture of sadness and fear

Besides his bronzed leathery skin he looks like any
regular little boy asleep We linger on his face and may
fearfully wonder if his eyes will open But he remains
motionless

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - BEDROOM NIGHT 192

Arthur carries the boy - wrapped entirely in a clean sheet
face covered - into the room and lays him on the bed

Suddenly from downstairs there is a loud BANG - the sound
of the front door being flung open

ARTHUR (CONTD)

(calling downstairs)
Sam

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - STAIRCASE NIGHT 193

Arthur scrambles down the stairs and is shocked to see
Daily sitting at the foot of the stairs his back to him

Something is clearly wrong Arthur slows and steps toward
him with some trepidation

ARTHUR
Sam

Still Daily doesn’t turn round
Arthur touches his shoulder and finally Daily looks up at

him His face is wet with tears

EXT EEL MARSH ISLAND NIGHT 194

The fret is thick now out here visibility low as the two
men crunch down the gravel drive Arthur following Daily

In the distance we faintly hear children’s voices

Daily stops at the edge of the causeway and the two men
stand silently side by side

Out on the marshes we can see the faintly silhouetted
forms of the spectral children in the mist

Arthur touches Daily’s shoulder

ARTHUR
Perhaps When she is at rest
Maybe then Maybe when she has
her boy she can let them go

Daily nods wipes his eyes angrily He forces a smile
DAILY
Well What the hell are we

waiting for I’1ll finish digging
you fetch the child

EXT EEL MARSH HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL NIGHT 195

Arthur steps inside shivering from the chill of the mist
and shuts the door behind him Almost instantly he hears
from upstairs the sound of the rocking chair

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - UPPER HALL NIGHT 196

The sound is louder up here its dull heartbeat rhythm
striking fear into Arthur He glances at the closed door to
the nursery but heads directly for the bedroom

As he gets closer he stops and reacts in dismay

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - BEDROOM NIGHT 197

The bed is empty The child has gone

Arthur sits down heavily on the bed filled with rising
fear The sound of the rocking chair continues

His expression turns to one of total dread as he sees

Stretched across the small section of hallway floor visible
through the open doorway is a long thin SHADOW Without
limbs or form but undoubtedly belonging to something
alive There’s something deeply disquieting about the way
it undulates then stops Undulates then stops

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - UPPER HALLWAY NIGHT 198

Arthur steps into the hall dreading what he’1l find
At the far end of the corridor the end opposite the
nursery stands a small figure shrouded in a sheet
Motionless And then slowly twisting and writhing

Still again then moving A small hand paws at the inside
of the sheet

The sound of the rocking chair slows

Arthur looks to the nursery door then back to the child

ARTHUR
Go to her

The shrouded child writhes again and begins to move
towards Arthur

The sound of the rocking chair slows almost to a stop
The handle of the nursery door turns from inside
ARTHUR (CONTD)
(toward the nursery)
He’s here I want to help you
Arthur backs up against the wall and watches as the
shrouded child shuffles strangely down the hallway a

horrible deformed stiffness to his movements

Arthur jumps as - BANG - the nursery door is flung open
But there’s no one in the doorway

ARTHUR (CONTD)
I don’t mean any harm I want you
to be together Take him
He turns back to the boy only to see
He’s gone In this direction the hallway is now empty

Arthur wheels back round in the other direction

The Woman in Black Somehow impossibly she is now right
behind him lunging at him

At this close distance we can see through her veil
revealing her wasted sunken face as she SCREAMS in anger

In abject terror Arthur breaks away The stairway blocked
by the woman he takes the only escape route now open to
him he throws himself over the balustrade

199 INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - STAIRCASE NIGHT 199

Arthur lands on the stairs falls down the remaining steps

200 INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL NIGHT 200

-And lands at the foot of the stairs in the hall
unconscious

We fade to black

INT EEL MARSH HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL NIGHT 201

From Arthur’s POV we see Daily’s worried face

DAILY
Arthur What happened

Arthur comes round groggily sits up

ARTHUR
He’s gone the boy’s gone

Daily looks at him perplexed then looks upstairs Arthur
follows his gaze

Through the open door of the bedroom we can see that the
shrouded body is now back on the bed

EXT EEL MARSH GRAVEYARD NIGHT 202

Arthur and Daily stand in the mist before Jennet Humfryes
headstone Arthur cradling the shrouded body of her son

At the foot of the headstone there is now an OPEN GRAVE
Beside it a pile of DIRT and a discarded SPADE

As we follow Arthur’s gaze into the hole we see that
Jennets CASKET is visible

Arthur hands the child to Daily and jumps down into the
darkness of the grave

EXT OPEN GRAVE NIGHT 203

Straddling the casket Arthur pries open its lid

Inside we see JENNET’S REMAINS - just bones now and shreds
of her tattered black mourning gown and veil

Daily hands the boy down to Arthur who places the child
gently into the coffin beside his mother

One last look then he replaces the coffin lid

EXT EEL MARSH GRAVEYARD NIGHT 204

Arthur and Daily stand by the now re-filled plot their
devastating task complete

Silence now besides the wind in the trees and the strange
calls of the marsh birds Arthur bows his head

ARTHUR
May you rest in peace at last
Nathaniel

(MORE )

ARTHUR (CONTD)
(pointed)
And you Jennet You most
especially

Daily nods in agreement Pats Arthur awkwardly on the back
Arthur acknowledges him with a grateful smile

ARTHUR (CONTD)

The fret’s starting to clear We
should get to the station

EXT STATION - PLATFORM 1 NIGHT 205

The SHRIEK of a train whistle as Arthur stands on the
station platform watching the London train pull in

As the train grinds to a stop and PASSENGERS begin to spill
out Arthur scans the platform urgently

Finally not far away he spots Nanny standing beside two
SUITCASES carrying Joseph

He runs to them and takes Joseph into his arms hugging him
close flooded with love and relief

ARTHUR
My darling darling boy

A dawning sense that something is wrong but it takes hima
moment to notice the concerned expression on Nanny’s face

ARTHUR (CONTD)
What is it

NANNY
He On the journey - he got
worse I can’t wake him up We
need Is there a doctor in
Crythin Gifford

Arthur gently moves Joseph away to take a better look

The child is asleep his lips colourless and his skin pale
with a sheen of sweat He looks desperately unwell

ARTHUR
(cising panic)
No Not here He shouldn’t be
here We need to get away from
Crythin Gifford If we can just
get away he’1ll be fine

Arthur hurries towards the BRIDGE that leads to the
opposite platform Nanny dashes after him

NANNY
I don’t understand Where are we -

ARTHUR
The other platform The train
returning to London arrives in
five minutes

Nanny looks back at the abandoned suitcases then runs on

EXT RAILWAY BRIDGE NIGHT

Arthur sprints across the bridge whispering to the limp
child

ARTHUR
It’s alright We’re going home

Nanny stays in close pursuit out of breath She follows
Arthur down the steps and onto the opposite platform

EXT STATION - PLATFORM 2 NIGHT

Arthur stands on the platform cradling Joseph looking
urgently into the distance for any sign of their train

He touches the back of his hand to the boy’s forehead
tries to suppress his panic at its temperature

He loosens the boy’s collar fans him
Nanny finally catches up to Arthur breathless

NANNY
How is he

ARTHUR
Hot Burning up

He looks at his pocket-watch
NANNY
Will I buy some tickets and have

a porter fetch the bags over

In his turmoil this hadn’t occurred to Arthur He nods
Fishes some COINS from his pocket and hands them to her

She dashes back to the bridge Arthur whispers to Joseph

ARTHUR
Daddy’s going to take you away
from here You’re going to be
fine

The train whistle SHRIEKS again and STEAM billows and
drifts as the train begins to pull out of the station

Through the windows of the departing train we see rhythmic
flashed images of the now-empty platform opposite
interrupted by the gleaming bodywork of the carriages

Platform - carriage - platform - carriage - platform -
carriage

Through the next window that flashes past however we see
that the platform opposite is no longer empty The familiar
flock of spectral children stand huddled together
(Including now the burned figure of Jeromes daughter)

Carriage - children - carriage - children

Arthur squeezes his eyes shut and hugs Joseph close to him
willing this nightmare away He shouts his protest over the
HISSING and CLANKING of the departing train

ARTHUR (CONTD)
NO

Arthur keeps his eyes closed clutching Joseph tightly as
the sound of the train recedes into the distance

ARTHUR (CONTD)
(muttering mantra-like)
Not here They’re not here

Silence now in the empty station but for Arthur’s fevered
muttering

And then from the bridge the echoing FOOTFALLS of a
woman’s light step

It could be Nanny But Arthur knows it’s not Despite
himself he opens his eyes and looks up

The Woman in Black stops on the middle of the bridge and
raises her hand

Arthur looks down Joseph’s eyes open and with a quick
deliberate turn of his head the boy looks to the bridge

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Joseph

The Woman in Black is holding her hand out

Joseph now fully awake pushes Arthur’s arms and wriggles
energetically from his grasp

ARTHUR (CONTD)
No

Joseph - all trace of fatigue and illness vanished - begins
to move fast away from Arthur and toward the bridge

Arthur lunges forward and grabs the back of the child’s
coat Joseph just shrugs the coat off and keeps moving

Arthur throws the coat to the ground and begins to sprint
after him His far-longer legs mean that he’s quickly able
to catch up He snatches Joseph back into his arms and
presses him to his chest

Arthur looks up at the Woman in Black and doesn’t look away
from her as he begins to walk towards the edge of the
platform

We follow him as with calm determination he jumps down
onto the track

He fixes his gaze ahead and begins to walk down the track
From somewhere 0C we faintly hear a woman SCREAM

It’s Nanny Back on platform two she stands watching
confused and hysterical an equally horrified PORTER
standing by her side

NANNY
Mr Kipps

PORTER
Sir Sir

But their voices are soon drowned out by the incrementally
louder sound of the approaching train to London

Arthur keeps walking clutching Joseph tightly to him The
sounds of the train and the shouting muted Peace now the
everyday world far away

A smile spreads across Arthur’s face - a smile of triumph
and defiance He looks up at the Woman in Black again and
shakes his head at her slowly

ARTHUR
He’s mine He can never be yours

Without warning the sound returns to a normal level again -
a piercing WHISTLE the thunder of WHEELS a METALLIC
SCREECH of brakes

A STEAM TRAIN is coming toward us at speed upon us ina
second But only for a moment

INT TRAIN DRIVER’S CAB NIGHT 208

Inside at the front of the train the deafening noise
level sustains as the TRAIN DRIVER his face a mask of pure
panic wrestles the BRAKE LEVER with both hands

EXT STATION NIGHT 209

Silence As jarring in its suddenness as any noise

Arthur stands in front of the now stationary train still
holding Joseph Both unharmed The train just feet away

Joseph looks around and finally up at Arthur who smiles

JOSEPH
Daddy

ARTHUR
Yes my darling

JOSEPH
Who’s that lady

Josephs little finger points over toward platform one
Slowly and with a sense of dread Arthur follows Joseph’s
gaze And we watch as Arthur’s expression of fear melts

away replaced by a moist-eyed smile

ARTHUR
That is your Mummy

Arthur begins to walk towards platform one OS as we watch
Arthur’s face we hear a soft woman’s voice Stella’s
voice

STELLA (0S)
Hello angel

Back on platform two we see

Nanny the porter the train driver and a STATION MASTER
crowded at the edge of the platform reacting in horror

But the lips of the living move soundlessly unheard by
Arthur or by us

Arthur looks away again and begins to walk towards a set of
maintenance steps that lead to platform one

JOSEPH

Do you have to go to work again
ARTHUR

No
JOSEPH

So you can stay with me

ARTHUR
Always

Joseph smiles and nestles into Arthur’s neck as they mount
the steps

The closer they get to the platform the more strongly they
are bathed in a soft WHITE LIGHT

Though we don’t see it directly it becomes clear that this
light is pouring through the archway that once opened onto

the street outside the station but which now leads to some
powerful otherworldly light-source

On the platform the light dazzling him Arthur hesitates
Joseph wriggles impatiently

JOSEPH
Come on Daddy Mummy’s waiting

Arthur carefully sets him down on the platform

ARTHUR
Go to her I’1l1 follow There’s
something I need to do

Joseph smiles at him and trots happily away
Arthur watches him go then looks back over his shoulder

On the bridge the Woman in Black claws off her veil and
opens her mouth in a soundless scream of dissent

Arthur turns away from her then crouches down to child-
height and holds out his hand

Further down the platform the dead children wait Lost

ARTHUR (CONTD)
(fatherly coaxing)
Come with me Come on

Slowly they begin to move towards him and the light

The Woman in Black still screaming silently moves down
the stairs of the bridge and onto the platform her arms
reaching out in protest

But when she gets close enough for the light to fall on
her she begins to shrink back afraid of getting too near
She clutches at the side of the station building as if to
stop herself being drawn any closer Instead she can only
watch helplessly

Like a kindly teacher Arthur ushers each child past him
Victoria Hardy Jerome’s daughter Nicholas Daily - his
hair and clothes wet - pauses and looks up at Arthur

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Nicholas Nicholas Daily

The boy nods

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Thank you for the pictures You
knew I’d be here didn’t you

He nods again and gives Arthur a small smile as he walks
on towards the light

The three Fisher girls holding hands sweetly are the last
to vanish into the whiteness Alone on the platform now
Arthur looks back one last time at the Woman in Black

A beat And then in a moment of humane forgiveness he
holds out his hand to her An invitation to walk into the
light and be free an end to all of this

She cocks her head a moment as if considering it then
with a malevolent look on her face she turns her back on
Arthur and walks away

Arthur watches her go Then he walks towards the light

We follow him seeing for the first time the burning
whiteness beyond the archway

Arthur moves into it his form becoming less distinct the

further away he walks until finally he disappears from
sight

FADE TO WHITE
