April 2013
EXT MOROCCAN PALACE - DAY 1

We fade up on a yellow WALKMAN and hear Deee-Lite’s “Groove
is in the Heart”

It belongs to A GUARD practicing his dance moves outside a
remote MOORISH PALACE ANOTHER GUARD is more chilled Until

On the horizon a HELICOPTER comes in fast and low FOUR
ARMED MEN hanging from it on ropes They wear gas masks

The men shoot both Guards Then they blow out the windows and
swing inside expertly releasing from their ropes

Moments later the palace windows BLOW OUT Fire and smoke
billow Through the comms we hear over gunshots

MALE VOICE (V0)
Area secured Eyes on the
target Target secured

We move in through a broken window to find

INT PALACE STUDY - DAY 2

The four operatives tying A TERRORIST to a chair The first
operative performs a swift body check then removes his gas
mask This is JACK LINCOLN 32 handsome calm and assured

Another man removes his mask Late 20s black good-looking
His code name is MERLIN He nods respectfully to Jack

A second follows suit Early 20s white well-groomed oozing
aristocratic confidence He’ll come to be known as LANCELOT

It takes a nudge from Merlin to prompt the third to remove
his mask This is LEE 22 - rugged face army haircut and
strong London accent He looks to Jack apologetic

LEE
Sorry sir

Jack draws a GUN and addresses his captive in perfect Arabic

JACK
We know there’s a second attack
planned today I need the location
It‘ll take five shots to take you
beyond repair so I suggest you
answer quickly

Still no response Jack shoots him swiftly in both legs The
Terrorist screams and slumps forward

JACK (CONTD)
That’s two You dont want to find
out where I’1l put the third

Jack aims for the Terrorist’s groin The Terrorist sits up
He’s smiling Between his teeth he holds A GRENADE PIN

Without hesitation Lee dives onto him with a warning cry

LEE
Grenade

It DETONATES Lee and the Terrorist are killed instantly

Jack Lancelot and Merlin are blown back by the force but
thanks to Lee they’re alive They pick themselves up

JACK
Shit I missed it How did I
fucking miss it

MERLIN
Time was of the essence sir Could
have happened to any one of us

JACK
If it had been one of the trainees
it would have been forgivable

Jack glances regretfully at Lee Then gathers himself

JACK (CONTD)
Where does this leave us Merlin

MERLIN
Lee was the stronger candidate
sir As I believe he just made
evident But Hugo’s test
performances have been flawless

Merlin indicates Lancelot Jack extends his hand to him
JACK

Welcome to Huntsman

INTEXT TAXICOUNCIL ESTATE - NIGHT 3

A bleak run-down estate A LONDON TAXI pulls up

No ordinary cab - the interior looks like a gentlemen‘s club
Jack sits with a dignified older gent ARTHUR 50s Arthur
gazes out of the window with a look of disgust

ARTHUR
Revolting place

JACK
We wont be here long
ARTHUR
I still dispute whether we need to
be here at all

JACK
Rules are rules” That’s your
motto isn’t it Arthur

ARTHUR
The rules are for gentleman

JACK
Theyre for Huntsmen

ARTHUR
And that young man wasn’t one

JACK
Not yet But he behaved as much
like a Huntsman as any of those
smug elitists the others put
forward for the job If it weren’t
for him I wouldn’t be here

ARTHUR
Is that what’s troubling you
Galahad Or the fact that your
little experiment failed

JACK
With respect Arthur -- you’re a
snob

ARTHUR

With respect
Jack opens the car door and climbs out
JACK
The world is changing There’s a

reason aristocrats developed weak
chins

INT COUNCIL FLAT - DAY 4

The front room of a small but neatly-kept flat On the wall
is a large framed shopping-mall portrait Lee in army uniform
with his wife MICHELLE 20s and their little son EGGSY 4

JACK (0C)
We very much regret that your
husbands bravery cant be publicly
celebrated I hope you understand

On the floor Eggsy plays with POKEMON CARDS desperately
trying to ignore the conversation determined not to cry
MICHELLE (0C)
How can I if you won’t tell me
anything I didn’t even know he
wasn’t with his squad --

Now we see Jack and Michelle sitting close by Jack holds
out a beautiful MEDAL She takes it studies it

JACK

I’m so sorry I can’t say more But
Id like to present you with this
It’s a Guinevere Cross Very rare
and to those who know what it is
very highly respected

(Michelle hands it back)
I know it’s not much comfort But --
See on the back here That’s my
number As a more concrete gesture
of gratitude I’d like to offer
Let’s call it a favour

MICHELLE
What do you mean

JACK
The nature of it is your choice
Just tell the operator “oxfords not
brogues” then I’ll know it’s you

MICHELLE
Sorry what Who the hell are you

JACK
Someone well-placed to help But
Im afraid I can offer only one
favour So you may want to save it
for an emergency

Jack holds the medal out to her again She just stares

MICHELLE
I don’t need your help I need my
husband back

She gets up walks to the door and opens it Jack stands He
looks at Eggsy who stares doggedly at his cards Jack lays
the medal on the Pokemon cards Eggsy picks it up

JACK
Whats your name young man

LITTLE EGGSY
Eggsy

JACK
Take care of that Eggsy And take
good care of your mother too
EXT MOUNTAIN CHALET - DAY 5

A magnificent CHALET nestled near a snowy forest ARMED
GUARDS linger outside Under a CAPTION “17 YEARS LATER”

INT CHALET - DAY 6

Lavish decor at odds with its occupants -- a hooded MAN tied
to an art deco chair surrounded by FIVE GOONS

The BIGGEST GOON carefully removes the hood revealing the
prisoner This is PROFESSOR ALAN SWANSON 40s There’s gaffer
tape over his mouth The goon starts to gently peel it off

BIGGEST GOON
So sorry Professor Swanson Just a
tiny bit more I’m trying not to --

The tape is half off now The goon tugs gingerly at it

SWANSON
For god’s sake just rip it off

BIGGEST GOON
I’m under very strict instructions
not to hurt you but --

The goon complies wincing Swanson doesn’t flinch

SWANSON
Look youve made a mistake Ima
university lecturer I’ve got no
money

BIGGEST GOON
God no this isn’t about money
Youre in no danger our boss just
wants to talk to you He’s a fan

SWANSON
Am I meant to find that reassuring

GOON
Let me get you a drink Youre a
whiskey man right Hey Red Can
you get a selection of our finest
single malts please

Another Goon - RED - hustles out Suddenly Swanson’s
expression shifts first relief then anger

SWANSON
Wait is this one of those prank TV
shows
BIGGEST GOON
Look youll have a drink our boss
will be here soon he‘’1ll explain
everything Honestly our whiskey
selection You will shit We got a
1943 Dalmore thats just --

A KNOCK AT THE DOOR The confused Goon goes to answer it

It’s Lancelot Late 30s now and wearing an excellent suit
he’s even more dashing and assured than in his youth

LANCELOT
I suppose asking to borrow a bowl
of sugar is a step too far

Before anyone has a chance to respond Lancelot draws his
WEAPON and shoots every goon in the room Stone dead

LANCELOT (CONT’D)
Professor Swanson I’m here to take
you home

SWANSON
This isn’t a TV show is it

Behind him Red re-enters carrying a TRAY of various rare
malt whiskies Seeing the carnage he reaches for his gun --

But Lancelot spins around shoots Red dead and lunges just in
time to catch the tray in his free hand as Red crumples

LANCELOT
1943 Dalmore It’d be a sin to
spill any don’t you think

Suddenly there’s another KNOCK AT THE DOOR Lancelot -- still
holding the whiskey in one hand -- readies his weapon

Suddenly from another room a male figure cartwheels in with
unbelievable speed and agility He wears a pair of paralympic-
quality RUNNING BLADES This is GAZELLE 30s

Before he can react Gazelle amputates Lancelot’s gun hand
with a graceful arc of ome - apparently razor sharp - blade

Lancelot drops the whiskey in shock Gazelle catches it

And continues to hold it steadily throughout the brief but
intense fight that ensues Lancelot gives it his best but
hes no match for Gazelle and his fearsome samurai running
blades The whiskey survives Lancelot alas doesn’t

Swanson reacts in stunned shock Gazelle casually strides
away to answer the front door

Its his boss VALENTINE He’s a Mark Zuckerberg type 20s
Valentine takes the whiskey opens it and sniffs it happily
VALENTINE
My kind of welcome

Then taking in the carnage and Swanson’s haunted face he
moves to a nearby counter where he pours two glasses

VALENTINE (CONT’D)
Looks like Professor Swanson could
use a drop too

Gazelle slices the terrified Swanson’s ropes freeing him

Valentine heads over with the whiskey He hands a glass to
Swanson apologetic and then downs his own in one

VALENTINE (CONTD)
I‘ll never get used to bloodshed
Makes me very nervous
(awkward pause)

Looks like we have that in common
(pausing for a laugh that
doesn’t come)

Truly I mean you no harm Ive

read all your papers watched all

your interviews Like I adore you
and wanna help you and I am so
sorry you had to witness all this
violence due to our unwanted guest

I promise you by the time Ive

found out who he works for you and

I will be best of friends

INT EGGSY’S ROOM - NIGHT 7

The photograph we saw before of Lee and his family stands
propped up against a wall We can hear GUNFIRE

Eggsy now 21 and looking like someone who’d mug you for your
phone lounges on his bed playing Call of Duty From 0Ss
over the gunfire we hear

MICHELLE (05S)
Eggsy I said come here

With a sigh Eggsy pauses the game

INT EGGSYS MUMS FLAT - NIGHT 8

Eggsy enters The room is now dirty dilapidated Michelle
looks worn down slovenly She’s slumped on the couch
smoking flanked by two shady men DEAN 42 and KENZIE 27

A TODDLER in a sagging diaper wanders around aimlessly

MICHELLE
You got any Rizlas love
EGGSY
No

DEAN
Go and get us some then

EGGSY
Get ‘em yourself

MICHELLE
Oi What’ve I said about talking to
Dean like that

Eggsy looks at Dean with distaste then nods at Kenzie

EGGSY
Threes a crowd innit Why don’t
Deans poodle go

Dean stands up He’s big intimidating He produces a TEN
POUND NOTE from his pocket and forces it into Eggsy’s hand

DEAN
Get your mum the Rizlas and some
beers and I‘1l tell you what while
you’re gone well show her three
can be good company

Eggsy struggles to control his impulse to deck Dean
MICHELLE
Give him twenty Dean then he can
buy himself a drink and all

She whispers something in Dean’s ear He smiles pulls out
another tenner Reluctantly Eggsy takes it

MICHELLE (CONT‘D)
Cheers love And do me a favour
can you take your sister She’s
doing my head in

Seething Eggsy scoops up the toddler and storms out

EXT COUNCIL BLOCK HALLWAY - NIGHT

Eggsy stands in a windy graffitied walkway stabbing at an
ELEVATOR BUTTON In his arms his sister begins to grizzle
Eggsy takes off his hoodie and wraps it around her

EGGSY
That’s better innit

He pushes the button again Still nothing Eggsy kicks the
elevator door and heads for the urine-puddled stairwell

EXT COUNCIL BLOCK HALLWAY -— NIGHT 10

An identical cold dirty walkway Eggsy stands at the open
door to a flat talking to an elderly Indian lady MRS JOSHI

MRS JOSHI
Oh come on Eggsy not again

She takes Eggsy’s sister He kisses them both on the cheek

INT PUB - NIGHT 11

A grim pub Eggsy sits in a corner drinking with two mates --
RYAN and JAMAL

RYAN
If Dean treats your mum so bad why
don’t she leave him

JAMAL
Low self-esteem that’s her
problem

RYAN

Puck off why would she have low
self-esteem Eggsy’s mum’s fit

Eggsy’s not really listening He stares into his pint

EGGSY
One of these days I’m gonna
smash his face in

JAMAL

Without really thinking Jamal points over at a bunch of SIX
GANG MEMBERS at a nearby table They notice

FIRST GANG BOY
What you saying blud

SECOND GANG BOY

The first boy stands up and walks over to the table He looms
over Eggsy huge Eggsys mates freeze Jamal hisses to him

JAMAL
Leave it fam Lets just go They

A tense stand off for a beat Then Eggsy gets up and heads
for the door His friends follow relieved The Gang JEER

EXT PUB - NIGHT 12

Eggsy Ryan and Jamal swagger out trying as hard as they can
not to look like they’ve retreated

RYAN
Yeah Werent worth it

Jamal nods in agreement He and Ryan both pull up their hoods
before they walk on Eggsy doesn’t follow them -- he walks
towards the curb instead stops at a PARKED CAR

EGGSY
Why you walking It’s freezing

He produces a set of CAR KEYS and starts to unlock the car

JAMAL
Who’s car’s that

Eggsy gestures back towards the pub and grins
EGGSY
His innit Took the keys out his

pocket when he come over

RYAN
Shit son

The boys all explode into laughter and pile into the car The
doors slam shut Eggsy guns the engine and the gang burst out
of the pub just in time to see Eggsy pulling out

FIRST GANG BOY
You‘re fucking dead

Eggsy throws him a “wanker” hand gesture as he tears away

INTEXT CARSTREETS - NIGHT 13

The car roars through the streets
Inside the boys laugh uproariously

RYAN
Floor it Eggsy

JAMAL
If they don’t kill you Dean will

EGGSY
The only person with the right to
kill me is whoever actually paid
for this car

Suddenly A SIREN FLASHING LIGHTS

EGGSY (CONTD)

JAMAL

EGGSY
Like that’s my biggest problem

EXT RUN-DOWN STREET - NIGHT 14

Eggsy slams the car into reverse and guns into a side street

DRIVING COP

Requesting back up --

INTEXT CARSIDE STREBTALLEYSTREET - NIGHT 16

Eggsy roars backwards up the side street

Tension and excitement in the car now Suddenly a SECOND
POLICE CAR looms into view

Eggsy turns sharply onto a PEDESTRIAN ALLEY

JAMAL
The fuck are you doing

EGGSY
Feds car can’t get down here

He’s absolutely right The police car slows then drives on
Inside the boys laugh hysterically

Eggsy backs fast out of the alley onto another street a
broad grin on his face until A FOX runs across the road

Eggsy swerves to avoid it And loses control The car
hurtles towards the pavement and hits a LAMP-POST

SMOKE pours from under the hood The first police car turns
into the street sirens blaring

INT CAR - NIGHT 17

The airbag has inflated Eggsy struggles behind it trying to
get his seat—-belt undone

RYAN
Dickhead

JAMAL
Foxes are vermin cuz You

Eggsy’s seat-belt is jammed Outside a second siren howls

EGGSY
I should‘ve done a lot of things
Ill sort this Get out
(off their confused looks)
I said get out

They do As they run Eggsy accelerates violently SMASHING
into the Police Car giving his friends an escape route

EXT JACKS MEWS HOUSE - DAY 18

A charming London mews The camera cranes down to a copy of A
TABLOID NEWSPAPER lying outside the front door of one house

The door opens and a hand picks it up We jib up to reveal
Jack now 49 sporting a beautiful tailored dressing gown

He smiles as he reads the headline -- “BIKINI READY KIM
KARDASHIAN LOSES 15LBS” -- then shuts the door
INT JACK’S HOUSE — DAY 19

As we follow Jack inside we realize that the mews house is
in fact huge - the whole row has been knocked through

In Jacks study area a classic silver TEAPOT and bone China
cup stands on his desk The walls are covered in FRAMED
TABLOID NEWSPAPER HEADLINES Each more trivial than the last

Jack discards his tabloid settles at his computer and starts
to read the Financial Times online while sipping his tea

We track in to his wrist to see a magnificent Dent WATCH so
thin that it looks painted on Suddenly the face glows red

Jack presses a button on the watch and hastily gets up

EXT HUNTSMAN - DAY 20

The discreet classy shop-front of a tailors shop on Londons
Savile Row The awning reads “HUNTSMAN ESTABLISHED 1849

Jacks classic Bristol CAR pulls up outside and Jack alights

INT HUNTSMAN DAY 21

A couple of WELL-DRESSED TAILORS nod respectfully to Jack

WELL-DRESSED TAILOR
Arthur is in the dining room sir

INT HUNTSMAN DINING RGOM - DAY 22

Arthur now late 60s sits alone at a large table He wears
GLASSES Before him am exquisite DECANTER a BRANDY SNIFTER
and a leather bound FILE There are twelve empty chairs

JACK
Arthur

ARTHUR
Galahad Finally The others were
concerned that we may be making a
double toast

There’s another brandy at one seat Jack sits down here and
retrieves a pair of GLASSES like Arthur’s He puts them on

JACKS POV The previously empty seats are now occupied -- by
TEN GENTLEMEN wearing wonderful suits and identical glasses

Jack exchanges nods of greeting with them Then his eyes
alight on the single EMPTY SEAT His face registers dismay

JACK
So I take it that it’s Lancelot
were drinking to

ARTHUR

I’m sorry Now were all present
Gentlemen Im thankful to say that
it’s been seventeen years since we
last had occasion to use this
decanter And as ever the
circumstances make even a 1815
Napoleonic brandy taste bitter
Lancelot was an outstanding agent
and a true Huntsman and he will be
sorely missed

(raising his glass)
To Lancelot

JACK’S POV the other agents have brandy snifters too They
raise them solemnly then down the brandy in one

ARTHUR (CONTD)
To matters practical before we
disperse One Galahad will take
over Lancelot’s current mission
Two I intend to begin the
selection process for Lancelots
replacement tomorrow I expect each
of you to propose a candidate and
have them report to UK HQ no later
than nine PM GMT Thank you

JACKS POV The other agents acknowledge the order before
removing their glasses As they do they disappear from view

INT POLICE STATION - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY 23

Eggsy is sitting in front of A POLICEMAN and POLICEWOMAN
staring at a DOCUMENT that lies on the table between them

EGGSY
I just wanna get this straight
right If I sign this and then I
tell you who stole the truck with
all them flat screen TV’s last
month you give me full immunity

POLICEMAN
That’s right And the alternative
is you go down And you’re looking
at eighteen months At least

EGGSY
I can just walk right out of here

The officers nod Eggsy smiles signs the document and hands
it over The officers stare waiting with baited breath

EGGSY (CONT’D)
The person who stole the truck

is the person you’re looking at
right now
(getting up)

Nice doing business with you
The Policeman leaps up and slams Eggsy onto the desk

EGGSY (CONT’D)
Oh come on bruv A deal‘s a deal

POLICE MAN
Doesnt work like that Nice try
though

POLICE WOMAN
You can give us names or we can
just bin it It’s up to you

EGGSY
I wanna exercise my right to make a
phonecall

The policeman lets go of him

POLICE MAN
I hope its to your mum to say
youre going to be eighteen months
late for dinner

Eggsy reaches inside his tee-shirt for the gold chain he’s
wearing Hanging off it is the Guinevere Cross

INT HUNTSMAN DINING ROOM - DAY 24

Arthur passes Jack the file Jack opens it Behind Arthur a
beautiful ornate antique MIRROR transforms into A SCREEN

ARTHUR
Lancelot was investigating a group
of mercenaries experimenting with
biological weaponry

ON THE SCREEN a horrific image of NAKED BLOODIED AFRICAN
MEN They appear to be trying to eat one another

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Uganda 2012 Synthetic cathinones

JACK
Like bath salts The street drug

ARTHUR
They put it in the water supply at
a guerilla army base Rage
Cannibalism Multiple fatalities

ON THE SCREEN a room filled with bullet-riddled CORPSES

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Chechnya 2013 Insurgents turned
on one another Indisputably caused
by our mercenaries But this time
no trace of chemicals of any kind

JACK
Unconnected with the first attack

ARTHUR
All their attacks were unconnected
And none could be linked to any one
political interest

JACK
Well they are mercenaries So
what happened to Lancelot

ARTHUR
Im afraid this is where the story
becomes a little odd

On the screen A photo of the high-security MOUNTAIN CHALET

ARTHUR (CONTD)

He tracked them to this property
in Argentina And while he had them
under surveillance he became aware
that theyd effected a kidnapping
He tried to execute a solo rescue
mission Failed This was his last
transmission

On the screen words appear “KIDNAP VICTIM IS PROFESSOR ALAN
SWANSON”

JACK
Doesn’t sound especially odd Who
is he

ARTHUR

Some climate change doom-sayer
Expounds something called Gaia
Theory Overpopulation as a virus
earth trying to heal itself or some
such What’s curious is that he’s
not actually missing This is him
In London this morning

On the screen a CCTV IMAGE OF THE PROFESSOR appears

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Well it’s all yours And don’t
forget your membership proposal

Arthur slides the file to Jack who stands to leave

JACK
Nine PM at base Absolutely

ARTHUR
Try picking a more suitable
candidate this time

JACK
(amused)
Seventeen years And still
evolving with the times remains an
entirely foreign concept to you

INT POLICE STATION - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY 25

RECEPTIONIST (VO)

EGGSY

Eggsy stays on hold the more surreal this all seems to him

RECEPTIONIST (VO)

as a loyal customer

The line goes dead Egqsy’s face falls Great

INT POLICE STATION - DAY 26

examples of British engineering

EGGSY
So it’s shit then

JACK
It’s only seven minutes to your

EGGSY
How do you know where I live

JACK

interesting question

EGGSY

EGGSY
You were in the army Like an

JACK

EGGSY

‘Cept my mum obviously Listen

Like to say thank you

19

JACK
Splendid idea

They pull up outside the dodgy pub Eggsy was at last night
Jack reaches into the back seat for an UMBRELLA

EGGSY
Yeah no Not here You wont
like it trust me

JACK
Nonsense It says they have draught
Guinness What more can one ask

INT PUB - DAY 29

The pub is empty Eggsy’s face floods with relief At the
bar the BARMAN eyes Eqgsy suspiciously

EGGSY
Two halves of Guinness

JACK
(handing over a TENNER)
Make it two pints please

EGGSY
Cheers So where were you posted
you and my dad Iraq or something

JACK
I’m sorry Eggsy Classified

EGGSY
I thought my mum had been on the
crack pipe when she told me about
the number Feel guilty now

They take their drinks to a corner table Jack downs half of
his Guinness Eggsy sips his

JACK
So Want to know something about
your dad The day he died I missed
something And if it werent for
your dads courage my mistake
would have cost the lives of every
man present So I owe him He was a
brave man A good man And having
read your files I think hed be
bitterly disappointed in the
choices youve made

EGGSY
Whoa hold the fuck up You can’t
just say shit about me like that

JACK
I can and I will Huge I9 great
performance at primary school
Then it all went tits up Drugs
petty crime never had a job

EGGSY
Think there’s a lot of jobs going
round here do you

JACK
Doesn’t explain why you quit the
paras You were halfway through
training And doing brilliantly I
might add But you gave up

EGGSY
Because my mum went mental Banging
on about losing me as well as my
dad Didn’t want me being cannon
fodder for snobs like you Judging
people like me from your ivory
towers with mo thought about why we
do what we do We ain’t got much
choice you get me And if we was
born with the same silver spoon up
our arses wed do just as well as
you If not better

Eggsy’s so worked up that he hasn’t even noticed that the six
Gang Boys have come in And they’re looking right at him

FIRST GANG BOY
The fuck are you doing here You
taking the piss

Eggsy leaps up Jack doesn’t move Eggsy tugs his sleeve

JACK
Some more examples of young men who
simply need a silver suppository

EGGSY
No there are exceptions Come on

Jack watches apathetically as the gang walk towards them

JACK
Nonsense we haven’t finished our
drinks

The barman watches too anxious He’s not going to intervene
The gang reach Eggsy and Jacks table

FIRST GANG BOY
I told Dean what you done He said
that makes you fair game He dont
give a shit what your mum says

JACK
Listen boys I’ve had a really
frustrating day Whatever your beef
with Eggsy is -- and I’m sure its
well-founded -- Id appreciate it
enormously if you could just leave
us in peace until I’ve finished
this lovely pint of Guinness

The boys exchange incredulous looks

SECOND GANG BOY
Better get out the way grandad or
youre gonna get hurt and all

EGGSY
He aint joking You should go

A beat Then Jack gets up retrieves his umbrella and heads
for the door

FIRST GANG BOY
You want another rent boy they’re
on the corner of Smith Street

The gang all LAUGH Jack doesnt react keeps walking He
reaches the door

And bolts it shut He turns back around to face them

JACK
Manners maketh the man Do you know
what that means
(off the stunned silence)
Then let me teach you a lesson

Eggsy watches staggered as Jack approaches First Gang Boy

JACK (CONTD)
Well Are we going to stand around
all day or are we going to fight

The gang are just about to erupt into shocked laughter when --
CRACK Jack lands a mighty right hook followed up by a swift
elbow to the jaw The Hoy goes down like a sack of potatoes

A beat -- disbelief - then the rest of the gang rush Jack
And there follows the most one-sided five-on-one fight weve
ever seen Jack systematically beats the crap out of the
remaining Gang Boys using a breathtaking combination of
exceptional fighting skills and incredible SPY GADGETS

Jacks UMBRELLA turns out to have a multitude of functions
Two boys have KNIVES - a MAGNET in Jack’s watch disarms them

One boy grabs Jacks wrist to get the watch -- it gives him
an electric shock

At one point Jack sees the Barman getting out his phone
Jack gets out his LIGHTER Which releases a DART The dart
flies into the man’s neck and he collapses

In no time all six gang boys are on the floor out cold
Eggsy stares at Jack Jack meets his eye apologetic

JACK (CONTD)
Sorry about that Needed to let off
a little steam Heard this morning
that a friend of mine died He knew
your father too actually Funny

Eggsy glances over with concern at the unconscious barman

JACK (CONTD)

He’ll be alright Just a
tranquilizer With a little
something thrown in to blank a
couple of hours memory Not
terribly different to what they
give you at the dentist

He pulls out his lighter again and points it at Eggsy
Eggsy backs away hands held up defensively

JACK (CONTD)
I do apologize Eggsy I shouldnt
have done this in front of you

EGGSY
No please I won’t say nothing I
swear If theres one thing I can
do its keep my mouth shut Ask the
feds Ive never grassed anyone up

JACK
You wont tell a soul is that a
promise

EGGSY
On my life

Jack lowers the lighter and claps Eggsy on the shoulder

JACK
Much appreciated Eggsy And youre
right about the snobs But there
too there are exceptions Best of

INT OVAL OFFICE - DAY 30

Close on Valentine holding up a photograph of Lancelot Then
he sighs puts it down We can’t see who he’s talking to

VALENTINE
Great You don’t know the CIA
don’t know no one knows who this
guy is Fine Seriously it’s fine
Well it’s not actually fine But
it’s not why I’m here

He puts the photograph away in a briefcase then leans in

VALENTINE (CONTD)
Look you know me Money has never
been my issue All I ever heard at
Princeton was how lucky I was to
inherit an oil fortune So I went
to MIT instead and then my tech
company is worth more than my oil
company knock myself off the
Forbes top spot yada yada Point
is you know where the profit went

(a beat)
Tried to save the planet Climate
change research lobbying Years of
work Billions of dollars And you
know why I quit Because last time
I checked the planet was still
screwed So here’s my epiphany
money can’t solve this The idiots
who call themselves politicians
have buried their heads in the
sand stood for nothing but re-
election The last two years I’ve
looked for a real solution And I
found it And if you really want to
make the world a better place
listen the hell up very carefully
because I’m gonna tell it to you

We pull back to reveal that Valentine is in The Oval Office
talking to THE PRESIDENT

PRESIDENT
Go on Mr Valentine As usual I’m
all ears
INT EGGSYS MUM’S FLAT - SUNSET 31

Michelle and Dean are watching TV Dean playing a game on his
Iphone Michelle texting Eggsy’s sister sleeps beside them

The door opens and Eggsy enters Michelle and Dean leap up

MICHELLE
Where the hell have you been Gone
all night all day Ive been
worried sick Mrs Joshi said --

She breaks off in shock as Dean punches Eggsy Hard

MICHELLE (CONTD)
Dean

Dean proceeds to beat the crap out of Eggsy Eggsy tries to
fight back but Dean is huge Michelle screams in protest

DEAN

Shut your mouth I’ve had it with
him He needs to learn some
respect Winding up my business
associates nicking their car

(to Eggsy punching him)
And now your mate’s gone and put
four of ‘em in hospital Who is he
Who was you with in the pub

EGGSY
No one

DEAN
Youre gonna fucking tell me or
I’ll rip your head off I swear

As Dean punches Eggsy again we track past Dean’s fist and

land on a tiny DOT on Eggsys shoulder Right where Jack
patted him We track in until darkness fills the screen

INT JACK’S STUDY - SUNSET 32

And track out again to reveal that we are now in Jack’s
study He’s hanging up a FRAMED NEWSPAPER HEADLINE beside the
others “BIKINI READY KIM KARDASHIAN LOSES 15LBS” The sound
of Dean’s assault is clearly audible in here

MICHELLE (VO)
Dean stop it Eggsy tell him

EGGSY (VQ)
I don’t know what he’s talking
about I wasn’t with no one

CRUNCH The sound of another strike Then Eggsy GROANING
Jack raises an eyebrow and walks calmly over to his desk

On Jack’s computer we see FILES showing information on half a
dozen YOUNG SOLDIERS Jack closes them all Now there’s just
a MICROPHONE ICON and a SOUNDWAVE BOX moving in synch with
the audio transmitted from Eggsy’s home

DEAN (V0O)
I could kill you and the world
wouldn’t even notice

Jack clicks on the microphone icon and leans in closer

JACK
But I would

INT EGGSY’S MUMS FLAT - SUNSET 33

The assault is on hold Dean Michelle and Eggsy look around
baffled Jack’s voice is coming from every electronic item

JACK (V0)

I have enough evidence on your
activities to have you locked away
for the rest of your life Mr Dean
Anthony Baker So I suggest you
leave the boy alone or I will be
forced to deliver it to the
appropriate authorities

DEAN
What the fuck is going on

Taking advantage of Dean’s confused state Eggsy heaves
himself to his feet and bolts for the front door

JACK (V0)

And I suggest that from now on that
you treat Michelle with the respect
that she deserves Over and out

The sound from the TV resumes Dean gets up to examine it
Michelle is glazed in shock What the hell just happened

EXT HUNTSMAN - NIGHT 34

EGGSY
No

JACK
What about Nikita The Dirty Dozen
(Eggsy shakes his head)
Pretty Woman

(Eggsy looks affronted)
Alright My point is the lack of a
silver spoon has set you on a
certain path But you needn’t stay
on it If you’re prepared to adapt
and learn you can transform

EGGSY
Like in My Fair Lady

JACK
Well youre full of surprises
Yes Like My fair Lady Interested
(off Eggsy’s nod)
Good See that horse Get on it

EGGSY
Are you taking the piss

Jack doesn’t answer Eggsy climbs on self-conscious

EGGSY (CONTD)
Whats this for

JACK
So that a gentlemen can see how his
new jacket hangs when mounted Now
give it a kick and say “tally ho”

EGGSY
Fuck off
(off Jacks silence)
“Tally ho”

(nothing happens)
What does that do

JACK
Nothing I just wanted to see how
you were at following orders

This however

Jack smiles and pats the horse’s flank three times

And the room begins to SINK Eggsy looks around in wonder

EGGSY
What is this place

JACK
The finest tailors in London

EGGSY
No I mean all this

JACK
Since 1849 Huntsman have clothed
the world’s most powerful
individuals And at the close of
World War One the notion was
conceived that the wealth and
influence of our connections could
be channeled for the greater good

The room stops moving Jack motions for Eggsy to dismount
Then he opens the door On the other side is now

INT MONORAIL TERMINUS - NIGHT 37

A sleek chamber like a mini subway platform Eggsy boggles

JACK
And so began our other venture An
independent international
intelligence agency operating at
the highest level of discretion
Above the bureaucracy and politics
that undermine the integrity of
government-run spy organizations

Suddenly NOISE A capsule-like CARRIAGE shoots in Stops A
door slides open Jack steps in Eggsy follows mind blown

INT MONORAIL CARRIAGE - NIGHT 38

There are four reclined seats inside Jack and Eggsy sit

JACK
The suit is a modern gentleman’s
armor and the Huntsman agents are
the new knights Seatbelt

Eggsy fumbles with his belt as the carriage glides into the
tunnel And then they hurtle away at unfathomable speed

EGGSY
Holy shit

JACK
Dont worry its perfectly safe
Standard mag-lev system -- magnets
(MORE)

JACK (CONTD)
Our vacuum tunnel just makes it a
little nippier But it rarely goes
above mach one Are you alright

EGGSY
Where are we going

JACK

The carriage comes to a sudden stop

INT SECRET BASE TERMINUS —- NIGHT 39

A much larger chamber with a huge door at the end of it
Eggsy and Jack alight and head for the door It opens onto

INT SECRET BASE HANGAR - NIGHT 40

A vast underground hangar A Bondaholic’s wet dream A
BLENHEIM BOMBER and F2 FIGHTER hang from the vaulted ceiling
Eggsy can’t believe his eyes as he follows Jack past one
amazing thing after another CARS GADGETS JET-PACKS

JACK
Before you make your mind up
there’s something you need to know

EGGSY
As if Im going to bail out now

He gestures around at all the cool stuff
JACK
Your father tried out for
membership of Huntsman He was on
his final field test when he died
This business isn’t without risks

EGGSY
You think I have anything to lose

Jack nods a little wistfully Understands
JACK

Then lets get you signed in

INT REC ROOM - NIGHT 41

Eggsy and Jack enter the rec room to see EIGHT YOUNG MEN AND
THREE YOUNG WOMEN standing around chattering excitedly

Merlin is here too Mid 40s now and even more handsome and
poised He marks the CLIPBOARD he’s holding smiles at Jack

MERLIN
Galahad Late again

JACK
(to Eggsy explaining)
My code name Good luck

Jack pats Eggsy on the shoulder and leaves looking back like
a parent dropping his kid on the first day of kindergarden
Eggsy hovers awkwardly then gravitates over to the others

MERLIN
Attention

Everyone leaps to attention Eggsy is beside a small mousy
American girl ROXY 22 She doesn’t take her eyes off
Merlin but discreetly pats Eggsy on the back reassuring

MERLIN (CONT’D)
Ladies and Gentlemen now we’re all
here welcome My name is Merlin
And you are about to embark upon
what is arguably the most dangerous
job interview in the world Failure
in any of the tests you’1l undergo
over the coming weeks will mean you
lose your chance at this job But I
need you to be aware that you could
lose a great deal more

(gesturing to the wall)
Can somebody tell me what this is

Hanging up is A BODY BAG

One man puts up his hand quickly Aristocratic good locks
well-groomed supremely confident This is CHARLIE 23

CHARLIE
A body bag sir

MERLIN

Correct Charlie isn’t it
CHARLIE

Yes sir
MERLIN

Excellent On the table you will
find a marker pen Use it to write
your name on the bag plus contact
details for your next of kin And
in a moment the rest of you will
collect your body bags from that
closet over there and you will do
the same
(MORE)

MERLIN (CONTD

By doing so you acknowledge the
risks you face You also
acknowledge that you will never
discuss your time here even with
your families You break this rule
you put them at risk

to Charlie)
Well what are you waiting for

Charlie breaks from the group and heads for the body bag

MERLIN (CONT’D)

Why is this process so dangerous
Because the job you are competing
for is a hundred times more so If
you’re not up to it wed prefer to
know now and not later when the
lives of others may depend on it
Does anybody want out

The candidates’ eyes dart around the room Anybody moving
Eggsy’s eyes meet Roxys They both look away quickly

MERLIN (CONT’D)
When you’re done with your bags
bed The dorm is down the hall
Long day ahead tomorrow Fall out

Merlin leaves the room and everyone hurries to the closet

A tall attractive Danish blonde AMELIA 23 gets there first
and starts passing out the bags to the first four in line
ULRICH (macho German) KENJI (slim Japanese) ANTON
(EZurotrashy Italian) and SABA (tough-looking Ethiopian)

At the back of the line Roxy shakes Eggsy’s hand

RORY
Roxanne But call me Roxy

EGGSY
Im Eggsy

ROXY
Eggy

EGGSY
No Eggsy

Charlie standing close by done with his task overhears

CHARLIE
Where did they dig you up

ROXY
You know we’re not allowed to
discuss who proposed us

The boy in the line ahead of Roxy has been eves-dropping
This is HENRI -- 21 French handsome well-bred He’s pegged
Charlie as the alpha male and is keen to forge an alliance

HENRI
No need to bite his head off
Charlies only making conversation
Thats right Charlie no
(shaking Eggsy’s hand)
I’m Henri

Two more boys -- RUFUS (rugged blonde South African) and
AJIT (good-looking Indian) -- join the group Theyve
already got their bags Rufus has two and hands one to Henri

HENRI (CONTD)
Thank you Guys this is “Eggsy”
This is Rufus and Ajit So Eggsy
are you Oxford or Cambridge

Rufus and Ajit stifle a laugh Charlie smirks too

EGGSY
Neither

CHARLIE
Harvard

The others grin These four are really bonding now

RUFUS
Wait I think we may have met
Did you serve me at the McDonalds
in Gatwick airport

EGGSY
No But if I had I’dve given you
an extra helping of secret sauce

He mimes wanking onto a burger There’s a silence

CHARLIE
Definitely Harvard

Henri Rufus and Ajit explode into sycophantic laughter and
head for the table with their bags

ROXY
Just ignore them

Amelia approaches carrying the last three body bags She
hands one each to Roxy and Eggsy

ROXY (CONTD)
Thanks Amelia isn’t it
Amelia Eggy

AMELIA
Hey Eggy Don’t take any notice of
those guys

ROXY

Thats what I told him
A suave Persian boy hands Amelia the pen This is OMAR

OMAR
For you bebe

Amelia smiles pleasantly and passes it to Eggsy instead
Roxy turns around presents her back for Eggsy to use as a
writing surface and looks back seductively over her shoulder

ROXY
Here use me

AMELIA
She means to write on

EGGSY
I know

He leans the bag on Roxy He writes “EGGSY PRICE” His hand
shaking a little he adds “MOTHER Michelle PRICE”

ROXY
Its just scare tactics Classic
army technique Nobody’s gonna die

Eggsy glances up at Rufus Ajit and Henri currently hooting
with laughter at something Charlie has said

EGGSY
Shame

INT ARTHURS BASE OFFICE - NIGHT 42

The same layout as the London dining room only everything is
Zaha Hadid-style modern Jack and Arthur sit half-watching a
SCREEN with a live feed of the rec room the sound low

ARTHUR

JACK

No
ARTHUR

Well you should now He’ll find
this humiliating Still at least

Jack indicates the screen Charlie is holding court

JACK
Hmm And thats your proposal
Charlie is it All the right
credentials besides having any
understanding of the real world
He’ll be a perfect replacement for
you one day

Arthur mutes the sound from the screen completely

ARTHUR
I believe were here to discuss new
intelligence on the mercenaries

JACK
Absolutely The mountain property
where Lancelot died was purchased
eighteen months ago The funds were
transferred from a numbered account
at the BGK bank in Moscow

There’s an AIRSTRIP here a beautiful BRISTOL JET on the
runway Jack strides towards it

INT DORM - NIGHT 46

A windowless army barrack-style dorm room with a WET ROOM
area at one end -- HAND SHOWERS and TOILETS all barely
divided by low walls and barely concealed by a low BASIN
COUNTER along the front Privacy is going to be scarce

The recruits enter All but Eggsy have SUITCASES They stream
to the beds Amelia Saba and Roxy bag beds up one end

CHARLIE
Oooh All the girls together
Planning a little action

ROKY
Why do you need some tips

Eggsy finds one bed left between Roxy and Anton Anton

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Not that I’d expect you foreigners

EGGSY

CHARLIE
I wasn’t even talking to you I
think it goes without saying that

Eggsy’s discomfort increases as everyone starts changing for
bed Not only is he without a case but everyone seems
entirely relaxed about undressing in front of one another

Especially Roxy She removes everything but her briefs and
starts casually rummaging in her case She looks to Eggsy

ROXY
Wheres your stuff

EGGSY
No one told me to bring anything

ROXY
That sucks Wanna borrow something
to sleep in

She throws him a tee-shirt and smiles at him warmly He
smiles back grateful but trying to avert his eyes

Suddenly the lights turn off There’s a collective GROAN

AMELIA
Looks like its bedtime

Everyone climbs into bed Eggsy lies staring into the
darkness for a while before closing his eyes

on his glasses and looks over to an empty seat

on infiltrating the GBK mainframe

Fire away

Under Merlin’s V0 we now see the mission plan playing out

a TALL WOMAN -- fur coat gloves large pricey HANDBAG

MERLIN (VQ)
The bank opens at eight AM The
ladies’ is on the sixth floor

-- The woman enters a beautifully-appointed elevator
-- In a TOILET CUBICLE she looks up at an AIR VENT
MERLIN (V0)

The vent is above the last cubicle

The shaft will take you as far as

the East fire escape
-- She removes her coat to reveal a fitted black sweater and
ski pants and a rather manly body Then she tears off what
we now realize is A WIG and A LATEX MASK This is JACK

-- He climbs into up the ventilation shaft crawls along

He drops silently from a ceiling vent and races upstairs

MERLIN (V0)
The vault is two floors up On
the north side of the building

-- On a landing Jack applies a thick layer of PURPLE RESIN
to his palms Then opens the window here and climbs out

- He inches toward the corner of the building the mystery
resin somehow making his palms adhere to the masonry

MERLIN (VO)
The security corridor is unmanned
until eight fifteen AM But the
laser field will be active Your
access point will be three point
two metres from the end

-- Jack slips in through a window LASER BEAMS crisscross a
corridor a-la Oceans 12Entrapment He expertly negotiates
his way down it leaping ducking slithering Impressive He
stops in the middle and gets a GADGET out of his bag

-- In a stark SERVER ROOM a HOLE is cut into the ceiling
A CLAMP bites the hole A CABLE is looped through the clamp

MERLIN (VO)
Youll have five minutes Get in
get the info get out

Jack drops down now improbably wearing a harness He stops
neatly above a computer and begins to tap at the keyboard

INT HUNTSMAN JET - NIGHT 50

Jack looks to the holographic Merlin aghast

JACK
That sounds exhausting

MERLIN
Do you have a better plan

JACK
As a matter of fact I do

Merlin shrugs Then he looks at his watch And VANISHES

INT DORM - NIGHT 51

Eggsy is asleep Suddenly a GRINDING NOISE His eyes open

Above him the ceiling of the dorm room is scrolling open
like a car sun-roof It moves a couple of feet then stops

A split second later a tidal wave of WATER explodes through
the gap and CRASHES into the room

Everyone scrambles out of bed The water is already knee deep
on the floor and still sluicing down from above

CHARLIE
It’s a test Look for a way out

Henri closest to the door lunges for the handle struggles

HENRI
It’s locked

CHARLIE
No it’s the pressure pull harder

Rufus and Ajit join Henri in pulling the door while Amelia
Omar Anton and Saba move to the walls pounding them

KENJI
The floor Look under the beds

Kenji dives under water Ulrich follows

Roxy climbs onto her bed which is situated under the open
part of the ceiling under the gushing waterfall

ROXY
Theres no other opening Weve got
to go through it Give me a leg up

Eggsy climbs onto her bed and complies but as Roxy moves
into the flow she is wiolently thrown back by the force
And they both fall landing in the now waisthigh water

As she swims away fighting the current Eggsy looks around
assessing his next move He sees Charlie by the showers

EGGSY
Roxy Amelia Try the bathroom

But they cant hear him over the gushing water Eggsy swims
over Charlie is trying to rip a HAND-SHOWER off the wall

EGGSY (CONTD)
Breathing tube

CHARLIE

In the loo It’s the only way
EGGSY

The loo
CHARLIE

Toilet Lavvy Shitter Whatever
you chavs call it

EGGSY
I know what one is I meant --

The shower comes away Charlie hastily unscrews the head

CHARLIE
Stick this in it go past the U-
bend limitless air supply
Simple physics Spread the word

Charlie smugly dives under water Eggsy yells to the group

EGGSY
Grab a shower shove it in the bog

Everyone swims over fast Eggsy tears a SHOWER from the
wall unscrews the head and hands it to Roxy and Amelia

EGGSY (CONT’D)
Well have to share take it in
turns to breathe

The others get to work pulling the remaining hand showers
from the wall then diving under the water with their hoses

Eggsy doesn’t have one The water is nearing the ceiling now
He takes a deep breath and dives under

UNDERWATER Eggsy swims for the toilets Everyone is
clustered there taking turns to breathe Charlie and Henri
share a hose Eggsy taps Charlie desperate for air Charlie
makes a shooing motion passes it to Henri instead

Eggsy swims up to the surface There’s only an inch of air at
the ceiling now He takes a last desperate gasp before the
water finally rises again and there is no air left

Eggsy panics He’s running out of breath when he glimpses his
reflection in the MIRROR running along the side wall A FLARE
of light catches his eye He swims towards the mirror

Eggsy touches his fingertips to it An odd double-reflection

Eggsy’s eyes widen And we pull back through the mirror to
see it’s a two way mirror The dorm is a giant tank built
in cavernous OBSERVATION ROOM Merlin is in here watching

With all the strength he can muster Eggsy RIPS a BASIN free
and heaves it at the mirror And again Until it SHATTERS

Water floods through into the Observation Room creating a
powerful current that drags the candidates

INT OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT 52

--And washes them out of the dorm onto the floor of the
observation room gasping like fish from a broken fish tank
Merlin surveys the group

MERLIN

Congratulations to all of you on
completing your first test And in
particular to Charlie And
Eggsy Who it seems has some
experience with two-way mirrors

(off Charlie’s proud grin)
Id wipe that smirk off your face
if I were you and show some
respect Not everybody passed

Eggsy follows his gaze and reacts in dismay
Amelia is still in the dorm lying in a corner Motionless

MERLIN (CONTD)
Training begins tomorrow which I
will have nothing to do with
Watching people train is boring
When you see me it means theres a
test Your real dormitory is across
the hall Get some sleep

They leave in somber silence Eggsy last glancing back at
Amelia in disbelief And TWO MEN enter carrying her bodybag

INT LAVISH RUSSIAN LIVING-ROOM - DAY 53

An expensively furnished living-room TWO CHILDREN in
expensive clothes squeal with delight as a clown wearing make-
up and a carnival mask finishes an elaborate BALLOON LION We
May or may not recognise the clown immediately as Jack

He passes it to the smaller child who bounces happily and
then talks gently to the other child in Russian subtitled

JACK

What animal would you like
CHILD

Penguin
JACK

Penguin My favorite

SMALLER CHILD
Lion is my favourite Nanny look

We pull further back to see a young Russian NANNY sitting
nearby She doesn’t look happy She stares at

He points to a FLOWER in his lapel The children giggle

EXT SECRET BASE - TRAINING AREA - DAY 56

The recruits (in jumpsuits) follow Merlin past an ASSAULT
COURSE to a row of KENNELS containing PUPPIES of all breeds

MERLIN
As some of you learned last night
team work is paramount at Huntsman
But I need you all to learn that
Before we do the assault course
youre each going to pick a puppy

He gestures to them to approach the pens We follow Eggsy
down the row of eager puppy faces A tiny PUG cocks its head

MERLIN (0C) (CONTD)

Everyone rushes for the assault course Eggsy looks down
then back to the kennels his dog is still there Lying down

Charlie Henri Rufus and Ajit leap onto the first obstacle
YELLING instructions Their dogs race off in every direction
Charlie catches his smacks it on the muzzle

CHARLIE
No Bad Stay

Roxy Kenji Ulrich Saba Omar and Anton show more patience
coaxing their dogs gently But it’s anarchy Suddenly they
all turn to stare at something

Eggsy is approaching in a classic slow movie power walk of
heroic determination The Right Stuff Armageddon Reservoir
Dogs Only slightly undercut by the little pug head poking
out of the collar of Eggsy’s shirt

Eggsy leaps onto the first obstacle Hand’s free it’s easy
He continues passing all the other recruits Forges ahead

Charlie Henri Rufus and Ajit try fruitlessly to copy him
Henri tries to stuff his wriggling Doberman into his shirt

Charlie has his shirt off and is trying to tie his Alsatian
to his back in a papoose It scrabbles unhappily

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Christ I swear if this bastard
scratches me again

Eggsy continues around the course perfectly focussed The
pug looks about as happy as a pug ever can

Across the field Ajit chases after his escaping Labrador

At the last obstacle Merlin waits with a clipboard

INT HUNTSMAN DINING ROOM —- DAY 57

Jack and Arthur are at the table

JACK
The name on the account is fake
It’s entirely untraceable

ARTHUR
No surprise there What else

JACK
Multiple regular payments to the
mercenaries Again no surprise
But there were a lot of other
rather large recent payments to
individuals Rather prominent
individuals

(MORE)

JACK (CONTD)
Scientists doctors academics
artists authors A few of them
quite well known

ARTHUR
How bizarre

JACK
That wasn’t even the most
surprising discovery That would
have to be the very large payment
made to Professor Alan Swanson

ARTHUR
You mean from Professor Swanson
Ransom money

JACK
No I don’t

INT DORM - NIGHT 58

Everyone is asleep Their dogs sleep too in training crates
at the end of each bed One crate is empty and the bed
behind it - Ajit’s bed - is empty as well and stripped bare

The crate at the end of Eggsy’s bed is also empty But
Eggsy’s dog is asleep curled up on the bed

Suddenly WATER rains down on Eggsy He sits up terrified --
not again

Charlie is running away with an empty BUCKET Henri Rufus
Ulrich Omar and Kenji practically wet themselves laughing

Eggsy leaps up and runs at Charlie livid In a flash Roxy
is out of bed She pulls Eggsy away

ROXY
Eggsy forget it Seriously You‘’1l
get thrown out It’s not worth it

EGGSY
Maybe it’s worth it to me Maybe I
don’t care if I get kicked out

ROXY
But maybe I care Maybe I want a
little bit of real competition
here If you’re gone way too easy

Her jokey bragging makes him smile He lets her push him back
to his bed His expression turns serious now He whispers

EGGSY
Why are you being nice to me
44

ROXY
Because Im nice And because ten
years ago Id have been the one
getting ostracized
(seeing his blank look)
Made to feel different Just for
having a vagina

EGGSY
Fuck off

ROXY
I didn’t mean you have a vagina
That came out wrong

They both laugh Eqgsy climbs into his bed feeling better

Jack leaps up grabs him by the collar Swanson WHIMPERS

JACK
My colleague died trying to rescue
you and I’m sure you saw how well

they paid you to keep it quiet

SWANSON
Excuse me I have no idea what
youre talking about Now please —-

Jack slaps him Swanson starts to scream

JACK
Man up I barely touched you
Christs sake I didn’t even —-

Suddenly Professor Swanson’s head SPONTANEOUSLY EXPLODES
Literally Were talking Scanners here Jack is thrown back

The back window SHATTERS and TWO ARMED THUGS burst in
They open fire as Jack drags himself to the front window
behind him and hurls himself through it

EXT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY COURTYARD - DAY 61

GAZELLE
Good news is we know the emergency
and surveillance systems work

VALENTINE

over us Whoever you spoke to --

GAZELLE
I told you I made contact with the
KGB M16 Mossad and Beijing They
all insist he wasn’t one of theirs

VALENTINE
Beijing It’s so freaky how theres
no recognizable name for the
Chinese secret service Now that’s
what you call secret right
(MORE)

VALENTINE (CONTD)

(mercurial he darkens)
Keep looking I’m sitting here
waiting to push the button on phase
two Its way late to be doubting
who we can trust

(a beat)
Not happy Gazelle Not even a bit
happy Know what Fuck it We’re
gonna need to speed things up
Bring the product release forward

GAZELLE

Speeding it up will cost a fortune

VALENTINE
Like I care Just get it done

INT KIT ROOM - DAY 65

A TABLE here bears PISTOLS and WEBBING Also incongruously
colorful HELIUM ANIMAL BALLOONS Merlin picks up a PISTOL

MERLIN

This is our standard issue pistol
made for us by Purdey and Sons of
London As you see it also fires a
shotgun cartridge for messy short-
range situations Please note that
today you won’t use that function
Take a gun webbing and two
balloons And leave your dogs here

INT SHOOTING HANGAR - DAY 66

A MAZE -- like a laser-tag scenario but much more elaborate
The candidates follow Merlin in wearing the webbing Each
has two balloons tied to them floating above their heads

MERLIN
Shoot other people’s balloons
First to lose both is out As is
anyone who hits a person And by
“out” I mean going home

SABA
Wait These are real bullets

MERLIN
Well spotted Saba Now on the
first signal scatter On the
second the hunt is on
A KLAXON sounds and the candidates race for the labyrinth

Balloons bob above the walls Eggsy ducks as low as he can

Charlie and Henri creep together in some kind of truce
Ulrich climbs up into a small TOWER structure

A SECOND KLAXON sounds Then there is silence

POP One of Eggsys balloons bursts POP Roxy loses one too
Up in the tower Ulrich is taking pot shots at everyone

But now he’s the prime target From their various locations
every candidate now has his or her sights trained on Ulrich

Everyone fires POP POP Both of Ulrich’s balloons go
Then he is HIT in the chest He FALLS from the tower

ANOTHER KLAXON sounds It’s over Everyone runs over to where
Ulrich is lying groaning Merlin approaches too

ANTON
Medic We need a medic

MERLIN
No we don’t Unlike Churchill’s
jumpsuits ours have Kevlar woven
into them The fall probably hurt
more than the shot Just as well
you were the first to lose both
balloons Ulrich You can
recuperate at home instead of our
sick bay And Anton That was your
bullet so pack your bags

INT SICK BAY - DAY 67

Jack is in a sick bay bed Merlin is here and they’re
watching a screen playing footage of Professor Swanson’s head
exploding in super-slow motion on a loop

MERLIN
You felt heat

JACK
Heat Yes But mostly pain

MERLIN
Are you familiar with pyroclastic
density currents

JACK
Something to do with volcanoes

MERLIN
Exactly Superheated gas and
matter Stand downwind in the wrong
conditions and your brain can cook
fast enough to shatter the skull

JACK
Right Only there was no
superheated gas and matter Just an
unoccupied room with a very
agitated academic in it

MERLIN
Im told even academics contain
fluid and soft tissue Question is
how did it get superheated

Arthur enters

ARTHUR
How are we Shaken and stirred

JACK
Never been better

MERLIN
Four broken ribs multiple
lacerations and concussion Needs
to stay at least forty eight hours

ARTHUR
Still significantly healthier than
poor old Professor Swanson Who
perished in a tragic gas leak by
the way There was talk of an
autopsy but I dealt with it So
what do we have

(looking at the screen)

Good grief

On the screen Swanson’s head slowly explodes again

JACK
I ran a communications trace The
Prof received a blank text to his
mobile Just before his head blew

Merlin touches the screen The video freezes It’s at an
especially amazing moment in the earliest stage of explosion
Merlin points to the blue-tooth earpiece Swanson is wearing

MERLIN
Swanson’s phone earpiece Rigged to
deliver intense heat directly into
the ear canal Triggered by a text

JACK
Let‘s trace that text ASAP

EXT SECRET BASE - DAY 72

All the dogs sit obediently in a neat line Watching

The recruits scale the side of the building Clearly they are
using the same special purple resin we saw Jack use earlier
Eggsy is doing well Saba is struggling Merlin shouts up

MERLIN
Remember relax to release tense
to hold The resin responds to your
neurotransmitter chemicals

Sabas hands peel away from the building and she falls
Lands heavily on the ground The dogs run over and sniff her

MERLIN (CONTD)
That’ll do for today Saba -- pack
your bags Everyone else wash your
hands then straight to room nine

Everyone gets down hurries off Eggsy stops to help Saba up
Shes clutching her back in some pain from her fall

SABA
Leave me Go wash your hands

Eggsy wipes his hands on his trousers smiles at her and puts
his arm around her for support her as she limps slowly back

INT PAIN TEST ROOM - DAY 73

Eggsy Roxy Charlie Henri Omar Rufus and Kenji sit
anxiously in SPECIAL CHAIRS with HANDLES on the arm rests
They grab their handles and exchange uneasy looks

Merlin moves over to a PULL SWITCH on the wall

MERLIN
First to let go goes home

Merlin throws the switch

Everyone reacts in AGONY Teeth gritted spines arching
Rufus lets go of the handles and leaps up out of his seat

While the others continue to endure their suffering Merlin
points to the door and Rufus leaves ashamed

Roxy and Eggsy are side by side Roxy slumped hair damp

EGGSY
No Im done

Roxy looks over to him shakes her head unable to speak

Eggsy tries to remove his hands from the handles But they
are glued there by the resin he failed to remove earlier

EGGSY (CONTD)
shit

One by one the others let go Kenji Omar
Eggsy tries again to remove his hands but he can’t
Henri lets go Then Roxy

Just Eggsy and Charlie now The others watch them intently
Eggsy starts howling writhing in his chair

Charlie grits his teeth But can’t take it He lets go
A split second later Eggsy passes out

Merlin throws the switch

Eggsy is slumped forward not moving Roxy rushes for him

checks his carotid pulse Charlie saunters over and yanks his
arm Eggsys hand remains stuck to the handle

Charlie grabs Eggsy’s hand and peels it carefully away from
the handle He holds up Eggsy’s limp hand in angry triumph
The palm is covered in purple resin

CHARLIE
He cheated Look

MERLIN
He won Take him to the sick bay

CHARLIE

This better not get him out of the
general knowledge test tomorrow

74 INT SICK BAY - NIGHT 74

Eggsy wakes up in the sick bay He looks around to see his
dog asleep on the end of his bed And Jack in the next bed

JACK
It’s not normally this crowded

EGGSY
What are you doing here You okay

JACK

Excellent thanks No Actually
not so excelient Worried About
you About throwing you into this
situation And how you’ve been
treated by the others So guilty
Rather unhappy and guilty Or is
that “TMI” as you young folk say

EGGSY
Ive never said “TMI”

JACK
It means “too much information”

EGGSY
I know Listen don’t stress You
gave me a chance I’m just sorry I
ain’t gonna make it Tomorrow Im
out of here for having “FAI”

JACK
What

EGGSY
“Fuck all information” We’ve got
the general knowledge test
(spotting Jacks Ipad)
Actually can I borrow your Ipad I
could revise a bit

JACK
(handing it over)
Im impressed That shows spirit
Determination

EGGSY
It shows blind fucking optimism
That lot have had years of the best
education money can buy and I’m
pissing around on the internet like
I can catch up in a few hours

Arthur and Merlin enter Arthur looks at Eggsy

ARTHUR
What’s he doing here Get him out

JACK
Its okay He’s trustworthy

Arthur shrugs and Merlin activates the SCREEN by Jack’s bed
A photo appears Valentine

MERLIN
Ta da Richmond Valentine
Philanthropist and tech
billionaire
EGGSY
I know him Their phones are shit

Jack Arthur and Merlin look at him sharply

JACK
Shut up Eggsy
(to Merlin)

Wait you traced the text to him
personally Or to his company

MERLIN
It came from a number registered to
a charitable foundation he runs
Climate change research Billions
of dollars went through it over the
last decade then for the last two
years nothing And not a single
current registered employee Either
he lost interest in saving the
earth or were looking at a major
tax dodge thats never been
investigated

ARTHUR
This fellow is extremely well-
connected Well placed to pursue
his own agenda whatever it may be

JACK
Whatever it is he considered
Professor Swanson’s life a fair
price for keeping it quiet
Any further updates on the other
abductions

MERLIN
Were up to twenty three at the
last count Scientists doctors
academics No obvious link with
Swanson or Valentine but it’s too
much of a coincidence to discount

ARTHUR
Still the whole business has been
rather overshadowed by the
celebrity disappearances

JACK
There are more Since Elton John

EGGSY
Elton John disappeared

JACK ARTHUR AND MERLIN
Shut up Eggsy

ARTHUR
Two more Stephen Hawking this
weekend And Lady G’Gar today

EGGSY
Gaga
(off their looks)
Sorry

JACK

I think it’s time for Valentine and
I to have a téte-a-téte

INT LUXURY PRISON CELL - DAY 75

The most luxurious prison cell we’ve ever seen If it werent
for the bars that divide it from the corridor outside it
would look like a suite in one of the world’s finest hotels
There doesn’t seem to be anyone in here

Valentine approaches carrying a silver DOMED SALVER
VALENTINE
Sir Elton I have your dinner Had
it flown in directly from London

SPLAT Something brown hits Valentine in the face It looks
worryingly like shit

And now Sir Elton John storms towards the bars incandescent
ELTON

Flown in directly from my arsehole
Want some more

He’s holding A TURD in his hand He flings it at Valentine

This time Valentine dodges it and backs away from the bars

VALENTINE

restaurant

ELTON

dance to the Muppet song

Eggsy grins Jack lies back down pleased Closes his eyes
Eggsy is silent for a while Then loudly bursts out LAUGHING

Eggsy

EGGSY

funny one for Armenia

JACK
Okay I tell you what -- if you get

lucky pen to do the test with

Jack scrabbles on the bedside table and grabs a MONT BLANC
PEN He tosses it onto Eggsy’s bed

Eggsy picks it up looks at it suspiciously It’s a nice pen

EGGSY
How lucky is it

JACK
Very lucky Go to sleep

Eggsy shrugs puts the Ipad aside and lies down to sleep

INT CLASSROOM - DAY 77

The candidates scribble away furiously at their exam papers

Eggsy stares miserably at his All the answers are blank At
Eggsys feet hig little dog looks up at him wistfully

Suddenly the Mont Blanc pen begins to vibrate Eggsy
inspects it curious It looks normal He draws a scribble

Suddenly it begins to wibrate again And starts writing by
itself quickly dragging Eggsy’s hand along

It writes “WINSTON CHURCHILL FAILED HIS A-LEVELS DIDN’‘T
STOP HIM FROM SAVING ENGLAND EVERYBODY DESERVES A CHANCE”

Stunned Eggsy picks up the pen He peers at the nib

INT SICK BAY - DAY 78

Jack is now dressed and sitting in the chair by the bed
ANOTHER PEN in his hand a sheet of paper before him and his
phone propped up On the phones screen we see

A slight fish-eye view of Eggsys staring EYE Then his FACE
An amazed grateful smile spreading across his lips

The image from the pen camera moves away from Eggsy’s face to
land instead on The first QUESTION on Eggsy’s exam paper

Jack starts to write

INT CLASSROOM - DAY 79

Eggsy scribbles away happily Or rather the pen does

INT DORM - NIGHT 80

Six beds are empty now Eggsy is back in his own bed Roxy is
reading Charlie kicks the leg of Eggsy’s bed as he passes

CHARLIE
Youre a fucking cheat When I find

EGGSY
Just because I didn’t go to private
school doesn’t mean --

CHARLIE
Oh no I’m sure youre highly
educated What have you got A
vocational diploma in carjacking A
B-Tec in impregnating ugly girls
round the back of a bus shelter

Eggsy sits up hackles rising Fist clenching Roxy shoots
him a look He swallows his fury and looks away Not today

EXT VALENTINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT 81

A palatial estate Establishing

INT VALENTINE’S HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT 82

Jack in a green smoking jacket follows A BUTLER The Butler
is wearing an EAR-PIECE like the one Professor Swanson wore

As they near the dining room TWO ATTRACTIVE YOUNG ASSISTANTS
pass They wear EARPIECES One holds a pile of PAPERWORK

INT VALENTINE’S DINING ROOM - NIGHT 83

A magnificent dining room the large table formally set for
two Valentine sits here dressed extremely casually The
Butler opens the door and announces Jack

BUTLER
Mr Roman DeVere

VALENTINE
Hey man Sorry I didn’t feel the
need to dress up

JACK
Think nothing of it

VALENTINE
I don’t know how it is in England
but over here it’s considered a
little bit bourgeois

JACK
Ive always felt that over-dressed
is preferable to under-dressed
When one is a guest that is

Jack undoes his tie sits Valentine pours him wine

JACK (CONTD)
Thank you for your invitation I
must say I wasn’t expecting such a
prompt reply to my request

VALENTINE
Well I gotta admit I was
intrigued to meet you There aren’t
many billionaires I don’t know

JACK
I don’t doubt it

VALENTINE
So I had my people look into your
accounts Obviously That’s some
pretty old money you’re from Howd
your family make it

JACK
Property mostly Property and the
markets Nothing questionable if
that’s your concern

VALENTINE
Listen you ask me all money is
dirty Im just into finding out
what caliber of person you are I’m
sure you get that

JACK
I most certainly do

The butler re-enters carrying MCDONALDS on a silver salver
Jack doesn’t flinch

JACK (CONTD)
The Big Mac please

VALENTINE
Good call But for me you can’t
beat two cheese burgers with
secret sauce Goes great with a ‘55
Haut Brion

Jack takes a sip of his wine

JACK
A classic pairing And may I
suggest twinkies and a 1937 Chateau
Yquem for pudding

VALENTINE
Great idea So let’s talk You
wanna donate to my foundation
You are aware that I’ve wound
things down in that area
JACK
Climate change is a threat that
affects us all Mr Valentine And
youre one of the few powerful men
who seems to share my concerns

VALENTINE
A billion is a lot to offer any
organization Especially one that’s
been inactive for two years

JACK
About the right amount to get it
kickstarted again Thats my hope

VALENTINE
I shut it down because I didn’t get
anywhere Every bit of research
pointed to the same thing

JACK
That carbon emissions are a red
herring and we’re past the point of
no return no matter what remedial
actions we take

VALENTINE
You know your shit

JACK
There are times when I envy the
blissful ignorance of those less
well-versed in their shit As
Swanson always said “humankind is
the only virus cursed to live with
the horrifying knowledge of its
host’s fragile mortality”

VALENTINE
Professor Swanson man I was
bummed about that Loved that guy

JACK
Who didn’t

VALENTINE
Yeah It’s funny not a lot of
people have heard of him
(then pointed)
You a fan of spy movies Mr DeVere

JACK
These days they’re all a little
serious for my taste But the old
ones marvelous Give me a far-
fetched theatrical plot any day

VALENTINE
Right The old Bond movies Man
When I was a kid that was like
my dream job Gentleman spy

JACK
I always felt the old Bond movies
were only as good as the villain
As a child I rather fancied a
future as a colorful megalomaniac

VALENTINE
Well Isnt it a pity we both had
to grow up
(finishing his burger)
Lets have dessert in the drawing
room

84 INT VALENTINE’S HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT 84

Valentine is seeing Jack out at the front door

Jack leaves and Valentine shuts the door Then he pulls out
his phone and makes a video-call to Gazelle

GAZELLE (ON PHONE SCREEN)
Well

VALENTINE
Definitely

GAZELLE (ON PHONE SCREEN)
Want me to follow him I was gonna

HALO parachuting suits Roxy has her eyes closed

ROKY
Fuckfuckfuckfuck

EGGSY
What Don’t like heights

ROXY
Yeah It’s okay I’ve done it
before Which is probably why come
to think of it

Before Eggsy can respond Merlin stands addresses them all

MERLIN
Listen up Your target is a red “H”
-- that’s H for Huntsman Your
mission is to land in it without
the radar detecting you If I read
you on radar or you do not land in
the H you will not be joining the
H Understood

Everybody murmurs their assent Merlin grabs a loop and puts
on a HELMET The candidates follow suit

The back of the plane opens

MERLIN (CONTD)
Dropzone coming up Twenty seconds

A BEEP begins counting down Everybody charges to the hatch
Merlin strolls past them jumps out first

Then one by one the rest pile out Eggsy goes second to
last Roxy behind him She clings to the door frame Eggsy

pats her on the back before he jumps

Roxy closes her eyes ard reluctantly follows

EXT THE SKY - DAY 86

The six candidates plummet through the sky Insanely high up
Merlin is already out of sight

Eggsy surveys his HEADS UP DISPLAY He locates the H and
begins to enjoy the flying sequence everyone jockeying for
first position trash-talking through the comms

CHARLIE
Cheer up Eggsy Ill get the
kettle on when I land have a nice
cup of tea waiting for you

HENRI
I don’t know Charlie It might get
cold

EGGSY

Didn’t know Charlie knew how to
work a kettle

KENJI
Dont worry I‘1ll be down there
first to show him

Suddenly Merlins voice cuts in

MERLIN (VO)

My my youre all very cheerful
Did you really think this was going
to be straightforward

(a nerve jangling beat)
Any idiot can use a heads-up
display A Huntsman agent needs to
be able to solve problems under
pressure Like what to do when one
of your group has no parachute

KENJI
Which one

ROXY
Who

HENRI

What do we do

MERLIN (V0O)

I told you aim for the H come in
under the radar And I hope not to
be scraping one of you up But if I
do and it’s from inside the H
please know Ill be very impressed

EGGSY
Everybody listen I’ve got a plan —-
pair off Grab the closest person

Nobody argues Henri grabs Charlie Roxy grabs Omar Eggsy
reaches out for Kenji

EGGSY (CONTD)
Kenji

Kenji is panicking The ground now seems far closer now
Gripped by fear Kenji pulls his rip-cord Nothing happens
He and Eggsy lock eyes Kenji tries again

Kenji’s PARACHUTE opens and he disappears from view

EGGSY (CONT’D)
Shit Were an odd number now
Kenji you wanker Quick make a
circle

Roxy grabs Eggsy’s hand With his free one he grabs Charlie

CHARLIE
Fuck off Eggsy Well all die

EGGSY
We pull our cords one by one Soon
as we know whos fucked person on
their right grabs them

MERLIN (V0)
Good plan Eggsy You have thirty
seconds Hurry

CHARLIE
Me first

Charlie doesn’t wait for a response He pulls his cord His
chute opens and he shoots upwards

Henri goes next His chute opens too
Omar’s chute also opens
Just Eggsy and Roxy left now Roxy is petrified
EGGSY
Hold me tight It’ll be okay
Promise Yours first okay

Roxy nods They hold each other Eggsy pulls Roxy’s cord

Roxy’s chute opens and they both fly up

Eggsy struggles to hold on to her He ends up clinging to her
leg Roxy is screaming

They hit the ground hard

We pull back to see they are the only ones in the H Merlin
is standing nearby He walks over

MERLIN
Congratulations You two managed to
set a record Opening at three
hundred feet was pretty ballsy

Omar lands in the H Followed by Henri and Charlie

MERLIN (CONT’D)
I should fail the rest of you You
opened too early people You were
all over that radar But given the
circumstances I’1l let you all off
(Kenji lands behind him)
Except Kenji Pack your bags

Kenji walks away from the group ashamed

EGGSY
Sorry sir but why the fuck did you
choose me as the gimp Am I the
expendable candidate

MERLIN
Don‘t bellow Eggsy If you have a
complaint whisper it in my ear
Come on Dont be shy

Eggsy approaches him nervous now He gets close He’s about
to whisper to Merlin when Merlin whispers to him instead

MERLIN (CONTD)
You really need to take that chip
off your shoulder

He pulls Eggsy’s cord The chute opens sending him flying

EXT CALIFORNIAN DESERT - DAY 87

The middle of nowhere A MOTORBIKE tears across the sand the
rider cutting loose doing tricks just for the hell of it

Suddenly a HELICOPTER appears The Biker changes direction

The helicopter banks follows him Is this a chase now
Finally the helicopter lands

The rider stops takes off his helmet He is DAVID BECKHAM
From nowhere a BLACK 4X4 drives towards him fast
Gazelle gets out of the helicopter Beckham calls out to him
BECKHAM
Oh come on this is one of my few
escapes Just take your picture and
then get lost alright
GAZELLE
I‘m not paparazzi Mr Beckham I’m
here to collect you

BECKHAM
What Who are you

Two SECURITY GUARDS burst from the 4X4 and charge at Gazelle

SECURITY GUARD
You Step away from Mr Beckham

To everyone’s surprise Gazelle begins to run towards them
He bounds into the air and with a flying kick

Slashes the throat of one of the Security Guards The Guard
crumples to his knees clutching his neck then collapses

The Second Security guard reaches for his weapon but a
roundhouse move from Gazelle leaves him cleanly beheaded

Beckham is terrified He holds his hands up in surrender

GAZELLE
My boss will explain everything
And there’s a lovely bottle of
Chateau Petrus on board your
favorite I mean you no harm
Please know that as long as you get
in the helicopter Im under very
strict instruction not to hurt you

BECKHAM
Really

Gazelle nods reassuringly and Beckham walks towards him
Reaching Gazelles side Beckham kicks him in the balls

BECKHAM (CONTD)
So I can do that
(Gazelle nods in pain)
And I could do it again And youre
not allowed to retaliate
(heading for the chopper)
How long’s the journey

Valentine talks to a large gathering of INTERNATIONAL PRESS

VALENTINE

In the past I’ve gone on record
saying that I want to make a
difference It’s a phrase you hear
a lot And what tends to follow it
are actions that have very little
net effect on our daily lives

(a beat)
Well Im here to put my money
where my mouth is And right into
the pockets of the man and woman on
the street Every year each of us
spends on average nearly two
thousand dollars on cell phone and
internet usage It is my privilege
to announce those days are over

A curtain behind Valentine swishes open to reveal a huge
SCREEN On it an image of A SATELLITE in SPACE

VALENTINE (CONT’D)

From tomorrow every man woman and
child who so desires can claim a
free sim card and usb stick
compatible with any phone any

JACK

INVITATION and moves past with a smirk Roxy shows hers and
the bouncer ushers her in At Eggsys however he hesitates

BOUNCER

The bouncer shrugs apologetically

EGGSY

CHARLIE
Aw you ruined my plan I was going
to let you talk to Lady Sophie

her once she was sufficiently
disgusted

And with that Charlie swans inside And Eggsy walks away

EXT ALLEY BEHIND THE CLUB - NIGHT 97

A SIGN outside the back-door reads “LULU’S - NO ENTRANCE
DELIVERIES DURING OFFICE HOURS ONLY” Eggsy is here trying
to pick the lock Not having much luck Suddenly the door
swings open violently hitting him

A pretty waitress 20s holding an unlit cigarette and a
lighter stares at him in surprise This is POPPY When she
speaks it’s with an accent similar to Eggsys

POPPY
Shit sorry You alright

EGGSY
Yeah Don’t suppose you wanna turn
a blind eye if I come in this way

POPPY
(lighting her cigarette)
Theyll only chuck you out dressed
like that Anyway place is full of
arseholes Unless you were planning
to rob it I wouldn’t bother

Eggsy can’t help but smile She’s cute

EGGSY
Aint totally full of arseholes

She smiles back and takes off her apron

POPPY
Not for long Early shift today

point of view Personally I think

She thinks on this a moment Then she smiles at Eggsy and
holds open the door for him

INT LULU’S SERVICE CORRIDOR 98

Eggsy heads down the corridor past CRATES OF CHAMPAGNE He
passes a store room Over the pounding of MUSIC from the club
beyond we can hear MOANS coming from inside Eggsy peeks in

Behind a stack of wine crates theres an intense threesome
going on Lady Sophie Roxy and Charlie

and swarm Eggsy One throws a hood over Eggsy’s head

EXT RAILWAY TRACK - NIGHT 100

Eggsy is tied to a railway track The Three Russian Guys and
Poppy stand over him Poppy now speaks in a Russian accent

POPPY
Weve been monitoring the Huntsman
shop Eggsy We saw you there This
doesn’t have to be so hard

EGGSY
I told you I work for the post
office I drop stuff off all over
London Whoever you think I am

POPPY
You went in to Huntsman one night
and didn’t come out again
There’s a distant HONK A train coming Eggsy starts to cry

POPPY (CONTD)
Is Huntsman worth dying for

EGGSY
Just let me go Please

POPPY
You don’t have to die Do you work
for Huntsman

The TRAIN is in view now Eggsy just SOBS

POPPY (CONT’D)
Last chance

Poppy and the Guys back away The train looms Eggsy SCREAMS

Just as the train is about to hit him the section of track
that Eggsy is tied to DROPS abruptly

Eggsy is now three feet below the track concrete walls on
either side of him The train THUNDERS overhead

Just the clear night sky above Eggsy now Silence And then a
GRINDING NOISE as his section of track RISES back into place

Poppy and the Men are gone Standing in their place is Jack
He smiles and starts to cut Eggsy free

JACK
Congratulations Bloody well done
And the tears -- incredible acting
EGGSY

I wasn’t fucking acting
He gets up furious Jack looks taken aback

JACK
Are you alright

EGGSY
What No Of course I’m not What’s
wrong with you

Jack pulls out his phone and presses PLAY on a video ON THE
SCREEN footage of Charlie Sophie and Roxy

JACK
Maybe thisll cheer up you a bit

EGGSY

Im not really in the mood thanks

Jake pushes the phone at Eggsy making him look

INT LULU’S STORE ROOM - NIGHT

Lady Sophie whispers something to Charlie He whispers back
Then Lady Sophie stands up and rearranges her dress as the

two Bouncers burst in and throw a SACK over Roxy’s head

They drag her out Sophie follows leaving Charlie alone

Moments later Arthur enters looking furious Charlie
miserably does up his trousers humiliated

EXT TRAIN TRACKS — NIGHT

Eggsy looks away from the phone not cheered up at all

JACK
Charlie didn’t even make it to the
real test Gave his identity away
mid-fellatio

EGGSY
No one expected me to pull Lady
Sophie did they They didn’t even
expect me to get in

JACK
It didnt matter who any of you
ended up with The test always ends
the same way

EGGSY
Oh yeah And the back up is always
a chavvy waitress is it Or was she
just for me Admit it Jack -- Im
not like you I’m not like any of
you Just give the job to Roxy I
dont belong at Huntsman

JACK
The results of your tests suggest
otherwise Come on Let’s go

EGGSY
Were you listening I don’t wanna
go back

JACK
Then come with me instead I want
to show you something

INT JACK’S MEWS HOUSE - NIGHT 103

Eggsy is looking at all the stupid headlines on Jack’s wall
Jack points to the recently added one about Kim Kardashian

JACK
That was the headline the day after
I diffused a dirty bomb in Paris

He points to another “BRANGELINA TO BUY 22M LONDON PAD”

JACK (CONT’D)
Broke up an undercover spy ring at
the Pentagon

He points to an old yellowed one A picture of BOY GEORGE
beside the headline “SEX ID PREFER A NICE CUP OF TEA”

JACK (CONTD)
Foiled the assassination of
Margaret Thatcher My first

mission

EGGSY
Not everybody would thank you for
that one

JACK

The point is Eggsy nobody thanked
me for any of them The front page
news on all these occasions was
celebrity nonsense because the
nature of Huntsman is that our
achievements remain secret

EGGSY
And this is supposed to make me
want to stay

Now Jack fixes two glasses of whiskey as he talks

JACK
People like Charlie are all ego
Theyre after glory And that’s not
Huntsman The best we can offer is
the warm glow of a job well done A
job that matters a great deal
Youre not lazy Eggsy If you
wanted an ordinary life and an
ordinary job youd have got one
despite your protestations I saw
it in you as soon as I met you You
were looking for something more

Jack hands Eggsy a whiskey and he downs it in one

JACK (CONT’D)
No no One may down brandy but
whiskey is sipped This is a 1943
Dalmore the finest single malt It
should be drunk with a splash of
room-temperature water never with
ice and it should be savored Let
it comfort you with a slow hug not
a quick fuck

EGGSY
See I don’t know this stuff I
dont know shit Maybe be I am
looking for something more out of
life -- doesn’t change the basic
fact that I don’t fit in

JACK
Oh for gods sake All that can be
learnt It’s what you have
naturally that can’t

EGGSY
You lot had a lifetime to learn it

JACK
Stop whining will you Plenty of
us didn’t Arthur didn’t Like most
snobs he came from perfectly
humble roots He started out at
Huntsman as a bloody pattern
cutter Tell you what get some
sleep -- guest rooms on the left --
and tomorrow youll give me a day
of your time Then decide Deal

Jack holds cut his hand Eggsy hesitates Then shakes it

104 EXT ST JAMES’ AVENUE - DAY 104

A wide shot Jack and Eggsy walk down the street

EGGSY
So are you going to teach me how
to talk “proper” as well Like in
My Fair Lady

JACK
Don’t be absurd Being a gentleman
has nothing to do with one’s
accent It’s about being at ease in
one’s own skin Now your suit will
be ready by lunch But the
accessories are just as important

INT LOBB SHOE SHOP - DAY

An incredibly classy men’s shoe shop The STAFF greet Jack

warmly as he and Eggsy enter
Jack picks out a pair of Oxfords

EGGSY
Oxfords not brogues

JACK
Very good

In the FITTING ROOM Eggsy tries them on They look weird

with the track suit bottoms hes wearing

JACK (CONTD)
Huntsman has long enjoyed a
relationship with certain other
places serving gentlemens needs
These are no ordinary Oxfords Do
your best impression of a German
aristocrats formal greeting

Eggsy looks uncertain then does a Nazi salute

Jack rolls his eyes stands up and clicks his heels
A BLADE snaps out of the toe of his shoe

JACK (CONTD)
In the old days they had a phone in
the heel as well Blades coated
with Polonium so be careful

Eggsy clicks his heels His own blade pops out

EGGSY
How do I get it back in

JACK
Very carefully

Jack stamps his heel The blade retracts

EXT SWAINE ADENEY BRIGG - DAY

together

A 250 year old leather-goods emporium Jack and Eggsy enter

INT SWAINE ADENEY BRIGG - DAY

Jack shows Eggsy a very cool-looking BRIEFCASE

JACK
They used one like this in From
Russia with Love But this model
has many more features

Eggsy is distracted by a beautiful WHEELED BAG nearby

EGGSY
Do I need a briefcase Could I use
one of these instead

JACK
My boy if you become a Huntsman
you can have the pick of anything
you like and Merlin will conform
it to Huntsman specifications

They look at the UMBRELLAS and WALKING STICKS

EGGSY
I always wanted a sword stick

JACK

Oh we have those But why bring a
knife to a gunfight

(he cocks an umbrella)
More lethal than an M16 assault
rifle but in the right hands the
perfect way to stay dry If only
the Americans could comprehend
that

108 EXT TURNBULL AND ASSER - DAY 108

The venerable shirt-makers

109 INT TURNBULL AND ASSER - DAY 109

Eggsy is trying on a SHIRT in the fitting room

JACK
A gentleman always wears a double
cuff And these are made with
reinforced cotton to handle the
Huntsman cuff-link May feel a
little stiff at first -- theres
kevlar woven into the thread But
youll be glad of it if you should
ever need it You like this one

Eggsy admires himself in the mirror and nods Then pensive

EGGSY
I feel bad You buying me all this
stuff I’ll pay you back

JACK
Oh nonsense Its not as if I have
anyone else to spend money on And
as they say you can’t take it with
you when you go

110 INT BERRY BROTHERS AND RUDD - DAY 110

A beautiful wine shop Eggsy looks around confused

EGGSY
Exploding liquid in the bottle
JACK
Don’t be silly Thats made by
Floris next door And it smells
good enough to be aftershave

Jack leads him to a flight of back stairs leading downstairs

111 INT BERRY BROTHERS PRIVATE DINING ROOM 111

There‘s a dining table down here elaborately set They sit

JACK
Heres the one place we can go for
a good meal and a fabulous drink
without having to watch our
tongues Now there’s no point
looking like a gentleman if you
can’t eat like one But it’s not
hard Once everyone is seated you
unfold your napkin and place it on
your lap

Jack demonstrates Eggsy follows suit

JACK (CONTD)
If you leave the table during the
meal you lay the napkin casually
on the table Don’t re-fold it

Eggsy nods listening intently A WAITER appears at his
shoulder with a silver tray of BREAD ROLLS

JACK (CONT’D
One serves oneself when offered a
dish in this way But if the dish
is placed on the table you offer
it to your immediate neighbors
before taking your own portion

Eggsy nods and takes a bread roll

JACK (CONT’D)
Always break bread with your hands
never cut And this is a butter
knife The only one to remember
holding his up)

The rest of the cutlery is easy
start on the outside work your way
in with each course And never let
anyone describe you as “HKLP

EGGSY
Whats that

JACK
Holds knife like pen” A habit
erroneously believed to be upper
class dining etiquette It is quite
the opposite

The waiter returns with a SOUP TUREEN Eggsy serves himself

JACK (CONTD)
Excellent

EGGSY
Do I wait ‘til everyone’s been
served to start eating

JACK
Only if the dish being served is
cold or if the Queen is present
Otherwise tuck in

Eggsy starts eating his soup scooping it towards himself
JACK (CONTD)
Other way Always push the spoon
away from you
Eggsy jokily picks up the bowl and brings it to his mouth

EGGSY
This is okay though right

JACK

Actually if youre in Japan it’s
absolutely the done thing

112 EXT HUNTSMAN SHOP - DAY 112

Jack pauses dramatically outside the shop

JACK
Now for the piece de resistance

113 INT HUNTSMAN SHOP - DAY 113

Jack leads Eggsy to the fitting room One of the TAILORS
stops them He addresses Jack

TAILOR
I‘m so sorry sir but a gentleman
is completing his fitting Fitting
room two is available if you like

JACK
One does not use room two when
popping ones cherry Well wait

The fitting room door opens and Valentine steps out in
Huntsman’s finest morning suit Jack stays cool

JACK (CONTD)
It’s not often that I’m the one who
looks under-dressed

VALENTINE

Mr DeVere What a coincidence You

was admiring your smoking jacket
and I suddenly realized it was the
same cut as my father’s He always

This your son

INT HUNTSMAN DINING ROOM - DAY 114

INT HUNTSMAN SHOP - DAY 115

Jack continues his polite talk with Valentine

JACK
Have you had a chance to think any
further on my proposal

VALENTINE
Youll be hearing from us very
soon I guarantee it

He takes off the morning jacket -- chalked for alterations --
hands it to the tailor and heads for the door

As Valentine leaves he is discretely followed by UNDERCOVER
SECURITY MEN we had previously taken to be casual customers

As soon as they’ve all left the tailor ushers Eggsy into the
dressing room and Jack urgently resumes his conversation

JACK
And if MI5 don’t bite

Jack listens to the reply sighs He removes his glasses

INT HUNTSMAN FITTING ROOM - DAY 116

Jack enters to see Eggsy admiring the beautiful SUIT that is
hanging here feeling the fabric In awe

JACK
So Are you back in

Excellent

Jack gets out his lighter and shoots Eggsy with a dart And
we fade to black

We pull back to see that the note has been stuck to Eggsy’s
forehead He’s still out cold Pulling further back we see
that he is naked And lying in the road We can hear a loud
HONKING It wakes Eggsy up

The honking is coming from A POLICE CAR Eggsy gets
unsteadily to his feet utterly confused He rips the note
from his forehead and reads it as he approaches the cop car

EGGSY

ARTHUR
Jolly good It pains me to admit
it Eggsy but you’ve done better
than I could ever have imagined

He draws a GUN and points it at Eggsy who doesn’t flinch
ARTHUR (CONTD)
Take it
(Eggsy does)
Now shoot JB

Eggsy tries to hide his horror He raises the gun and aims it
at his dog The dog walks up to the barrel and licks it

Eggsy lowers the gun in despair No way he can do this
From another room we hear A GUNSHOT

ARTHUR (CONTD)
At least the girl has some balls

Eggsy grabs the dog and runs from the room Arthur just
watches him go Then he picks up the phone

ARTHUR (CONT’D)
Merlin bring Roxy in please And
contact the agents We’1ll hold her
swearing-in ceremony in an hour

140 EXT PUB - DAY 140

Dean and his Gang Boys are sitting outside drinking The
Bristol pulls up To their disbelief Eggsy opens the window

EGGSY
Oi Dean Can I have a word

DEAN
Only if you get out that poncy car
first And only if the word is “ow
you broke my nose”

EGGSY
Thats five words But no worries
About time you hit a man instead of
a bird Tell your muppets to go
inside and I’11 get out the car

Dean nods and the Boys all run inside Seconds later they
appear at the pub window craning for a good view

DEAN
Come on then you little prick

Eggsy smiles calmly and reaches for the door handle THUNK
The lock clicks shut Eggsy tries to pull it It wont budge

Dean looks at him incredulous

Eggsy reacts in total dismay and puzzlement as -- ROAR
the engine starts And the car pulls away

The Gang Boys LAUGH loudly Dean yells after him
DEAN (CONT’D)

grown a pair

INT BRISTOL CAR - DAY 141

And still the car keeps driving

EXT JACK’S HOUSE - DAY 142

The Bristol comes hurtling down Jack’s mews Jack is standing
at his front door holding a REMOTE CONTROL
The car stops sharply beside him

JACK
If there were such thing as an
ejector seat I’d be using it right
now Get out

INT JACK’S HOUSE - DAY 143

Jack shuts the door and rounds on Eggsy

JACK
You threw away your greatest
achievement over a fucking dog And
then you stole one of our cars
Thanks for humiliating me

EGGSY
If you think it’s alright to shoot
a dog just to get a fucking job
then I’m happy I humiliated you
I‘m only sorry I didnt do worse

Jack grabs Eggsy by his collar and marches him to the loo He
kicks the door open to reveal A MOUNTED TAXIDERMY DOG

JACK
Youre right And the guilt never
left me but I understood the
importance of following orders and
Mr Pickle here reminds me of that
every time I take a shit

EGGSY
You shot your dog and had it
stuffed you sick fuck

JACK

No I shot my dog And then I
brought him home and continued to
care for him for the next eleven
years until he died of
pancreatitis It was a blank
Eggsy It was a fucking blank

(off Eggsy’s silence)
And do you remember Amelia

(off his nod)
She works at our tech department in
Berlin She’s fine Limits must be
tested but Huntsman only condones
risking a life to save another

EGGSY
Oh yeah Like my dad saved yours
Even though your fuck up cost his

This hits Jack hard His emotional dam finally breaks

JACK
And as long as I live I’1l1 never
forget it Never forgive myself
Cant you see that That all I’ve
ever wanted is to make it right
somehow Cant you see that
everything I’ve done is about
trying to repay him By giving his
son a new life The life he so
dearly wanted for himself

EGGSY
(moved softening)
I’m sorry You gave me a chance
Ill always be grateful for that
(MORE)

EGGSY (CONTD)
I’m gonna take what you taught me
and try and do something good with
my life For my dad And for you
(a beat)
Shall I take the car back now

They are interrupted by a SIGNAL from Jacks watch He puts
on his glasses throws Eggsy an apologetic look

JACK

(on the phone)
-You’re joking Where the hell
were MI5 Any idea of the
destination Well there are
dozens of airports in Kansas do we
know which one I’m on my way

(glasses off to Eggsy)
Im sorry I need to go Look Ill

able to secure you a job in admin

The rally has begun The CHURCH LEADER 60s is bellowing

CHURCH LEADER
Watch the news AIDS floods the
blood of the innocent spilled
And yet there are those who doubt
that this is the wrath of God

The CONGREGATION jeer in agreement Jack is here trying his
best to blend in He puts on his glasses and scans the room

CHURCH LEADER (CONT’D)
Our filthy Goverment condones
sodomy divorce and abortion And
yet some still doubt that this is
the work of The Antichrist

146 INT JACK’S HOUSE - NIGHT 146

Eggsy is using Jack’s computer to check his Facebook Posts
saying “where da fuck r u” etc Suddenly a WINDOW pops
up a LIVE VIDEO showing what Jack is seeing Audio too

CHURCH LEADER (V0O)
To those I say you may not be a
fag a Jew a nigger or a whore
who has congress out of wedlock

Jacks is looking around the room now focussing on HIDDEN
CAMERAS There are many Then he looks back to the pulpit

CHURCH LEADER (V0) (CONTD)
You may not yourself be a dirty
foreigner a perverted Catholic or
a murdering soldier

147 INT CHURCH - DAY 147

The Church Leader is getting louder

CHURCH LEADER
But if you enable those who are
GOD HATES YOU And he will SMITE
your sons and daughters and he will
rejoice in your tears

The crowd CHEERS Jack looks around again No Valentine He
gets up to leave A BLONDE WOMAN beside him gives him a look

BLONDE WOMAN
Hey What’s your problem

Jack leans in and whispers to her as he slips past her

JACK
I’m a Catholic whore currently
enjoying congress out of wedlock

works in a military abortion
clinic Hail Satan and have a
lovely afternoon madam

VALENTINE

Okay Go

(Gazelle taps some keys)
Now lets just hope enough of these
freaks have our sim cards

INT CHURCH DAY 149

Jack is edging down a side-aisle towards the exit as the
Church Leader continues

CHURCH LEADER
And to those who would threaten our
first amendment rights I say —-

He stops Theres a strange high-pitched WHINE coming from
multiple directions He gets his PHONE out perplexed

In the congregation everyone is having a similar reaction
The whine continues A few people checking their PHONES too
In the aisle Jack staggers feeling peculiar

The Church Leader tears the CROSS from the wall behind him
Then he locks eyes with a HEAVY-SET MAN in the front row

And charges at him IMPALING him with the cross

A second later all hell breaks loose and the congregation
begin to VICIOUSLY ATTACK one another Several have GUNS

A TALL MAN charges at Jack Jack draws his own gun and pistol
whips the man knocking him to the ground

But then he keeps hitting him Can’t stop Whatever these
urges are Jack is affected too He ranges into the melee

INT JACK’S HOUSE - DAY 150

Eggsy watches the mayhem onscreen dumbstruck

It‘s wholesale slaughter but Jack’s trained killer status is
distinctly apparent he’s cutting his way across the room
taking people down leaving a trail of bodies behind him

Eggsy clicks something that looks like a communication icon

EGGSY
Jack Can you hear me What are you
doing What’s happening

INT CONTROL ROOM - DAY 151

Valentine and Gazelle watch pleased

VALENTINE
Bingo Nailed it Response rate
one hundred percent

GAZELLE
Hmmm But these guys were pretty
aggressive already God hates this
god hates that

VALENTINE
But they liked each other just
fine It works damn it

GAZELLE
Im just saying if you’d chosen
like Buddhists or something

VALENTINE
The fuss that woulda caused is the
last thing we need this close to Vv
day Everyone thinks these guys are
nuts already It’s perfect And we
even got to wipe out the Huntsman

GAZELLE
Not yet

INT CHURCH - DAY 152

Jack is choking the Church Leader to death

Behind him a woman repeatedly slams another woman’s head
into a pew until she is suddenly shot in the head

Jack drops the dead Church Leader and turns to see that he
and an ARMED MAN are the last two standing Jack draws his
gun and shoots but he’s out of ammo

The man fires misses Now he’s out of ammo too and Jack
is upon him with a SILVER CANDLESTICK WHAM He goes down

It’s quiet now except for the WHINE Suddenly it STOPS

Coming back to his senses now Jack surveys the scene And
he’s horrified He hears Eggsy’s voice

EGGSY (V0)
Jack Jack Can you hear me

JACK
They did something to me To
everyone I I’ve got to get out
153 EXT CHURCH DAY 153

Jack bursts out into the open only to see Gazelle sprinting
towards him gun aimed Valentine walks behind leisurely

GAZELLE
Drop your weapons
(Jack drops his gun)
All of them

VALENTINE
Judging by the fact that he used a
candlestick for his last kill I’m
thinking he’s outta tricks Am I
right or am I right

JACK
What did you do to me I had no
control I would never I killed

all those people I wanted to

VALENTINE
Clever isn’t it In simple terms
it’s a neurological wave that
triggers the centre of aggression
and switches off inhibitors

JACK
Transmitted through your nasty free
Sim cards I assume

Valentine starts to laugh

VALENTINE

You know what this is getting like
Its getting like those old movies
we both love Like I’m gonna tell
you my whole plan and then I set up
an absurdly convoluted way of
killing you that you find an
equally convoluted way of escaping

JACK
Sounds good to me

VALENTINE
Like I said It’s a shame that we
both had to grow up

He nods to Gazelle and Gazelle shoots Jack dead

INT JACK’S HOUSE - NIGHT 154

Eggsy freaks out

EGGSY

EXT CHURCH - NIGHT 155

Valentine and Gazelle walk away

INTEXT JACK’S CARSAVILE ROW — DAY 156

Jack’s car screeches around a corner races up the street

Eggsy is driving in shock He pulls up outside Huntsman The
shop is closed but there’s a light on upstairs

INT HUNTSMAN DINING ROOM - NIGHT 157

Arthur stands at the fireplace The decanter is on the table

EGGSY
Arthur Jacks dead

ARTHUR
Galahad Galahad is dead Hence we
have all just toasted him

EGGSY
Then you know what that maniac is
doing How many people round the
world have those sim cards If they
all go homicidal at the same time —-

ARTHUR
Indeed And thanks to Galahad’s
recording we have Valentine’s
confession The intelligence has
been turned over to the relevant
authorities Our work is complete
And a most distinguished legacy for
our fallen friend it is too
99

EGGSY
Thats it

ARTHUR
Sit down boy See this It’s an
1815 Napoleonic brandy It is only
drunk when we lose a Huntsman
(filling two snifters)

Galahad was fond of you and on this
occasion I feel it acceptable to
bend the rules Join me in a toast

Eggsy takes the snifter They both sit then raise their
glasses Arthur downs the brandy in one Eggsy does the same

EGGSY
Jack told me you don’t like to
break rules Arthur Why now

Eggsy stares at the mantel over the fireplace Tucked behind
a vase is AN EAR-PIECE Arthur follows his gaze and smiles

ARTHUR
You really are jolly good Eggsy
Perhaps I’1ll make you my proposal
for the Galahad position If we can
see eye to eye on certain
political matters

He places a PEN on the desk

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Can you guess what this might be

EGGSY
Yeah Jack showed me one when we
went shopping Activates the poison
that was clearly in my suspiciously
un-smooth brandy I’1l be dead ten
seconds after you click it

ARTHUR
Oh bravo

EGGSY
Valentine won you over Somehow
But not Jack So you let Jack go to
his death

ARTHUR
I know Jack too well Hes accused
me of being closed minded but he’s
an intractable bugger himself And
a sentimental one I elected not to
even try His dissent would have
put us all at risk

Eggsy eyes Arthur’s hand on the pen

EGGSY
But you think I might Agree To
turn a blind eye to Valentine
wiping out How many people
Millions You haven’t told the
authorities at all have you

Arthur cocks his head smiles Eggsy is correct

ARTHUR
Theyre all on board Grateful to
Valentine for solving the issues
that they promised they could fix
but deep down knew they could not
Once he explained I understood

158 INT HUNTSMAN PATTERN ROOM - FLASHBACK - DAY 158

Valentine is pitching his ethos to Arthur He comes over as
fiercely intelligent reasonable charismatic

VALENTINE
Earth is a self-regulating system
but anthropogenic forcing has
interfered by changing the external
boundary conditions Man’s
agriculture and industry has
altered and depleted forty percent
of the planet’s surface The human
body is another self-regulating
system When a virus interferes
with its functions either the
virus is destroyed or the host is
destroyed

ARTHUR
Either way the virus dies

VALENTINE
Mankind is that virus Population
growth is out of control Even if
you take climate change from the
equation the point of no return
passed a long time ago Fact is
were only sixty years away from
running out of space to grow enough
food to sustain this horde of ours
Fifty years from having depleted
the seas of all edible seafood
Whether we starve ourselves to
extinction or our carbon emissions
raise temperature to uninhabitable
levels first the outcome is the
same The virus dies

159 INT HUNTSMAN DINING ROOM - PRESENT — DAY 159

Arthur has just finished recounting this to Eggsy

EGGSY
So Valentine proposes to take care
of the population problem himself

ARTHUR
If nobody does nature will do it
for us Sometimes a culling is the
only way to ensure a species’
survival History will come to
regard Valentine as the man who
saved humanity from extinction

EGGSY
And he’s picking and choosing who
gets culled is he All his rich
mates they get to live And all
the people he rates as clever or
talented he’s keeping them safe
whether they agree with him or not

ARTHUR
And you Eggsy In Jack’s honour
I’m inviting you A new world will
rise from the ashes and you can be
part of it Time to make your
decision

EGGSY
Id rather be with Jack thanks

ARTHUR
So be it

Arthur clicks the pen Nothing happens
EGGSY
The problem with us common types is
that were light fingered
Arthur starts to wretch
EGGSY (CONTD)
Huntsman’s taught me a lot But
sleight of hand I had that down
already

Arthur collapses Eggsy grabs the ear-piece from Arthurs ear
and the PHONE from his pocket

ON THE PHONE A COUNTDOWN CLOCK 084259 Seconds ticking

INT SECRET BASE HANGAR — NIGHT 160

Eggsy has his hands up Roxy has a gun on him while Merlin
examines Arthurs phone and ear-piece

MERLIN
Okay Lancelot put it down It’s
verified

Roxy lowers the gun Eqgsy lowers his hands

MERLIN (CONTD)
Arthur’s phone is receiving update
texts about getting to safety
There’s not a lot of time

EGGSY
What are you gonna do

MERLIN
God knows who’s in Valentines
pocket and whos not We have no
choice but to deal with this
ourselves

EGGSY
Do you mean Me as well

Merlin glances at the clock then back to Eggsy indicating
an odd-looking RETRO EXO-SKELETON CONTRAPTION on a shelf

MERLIN
Load that into the plane

ROXY
Where are we going

MERLIN
Valentine’s base He’s sent the
coordinates in a group text
inviting his chosen people to join
him there if they don’t have a safe
retreat of their own

EXT VALENTINE’S MOUNTAIN BASE - NIGHT 161

We follow a PRIVATE JET flying towards a huge MOUNTAIN

Inside the pilot looks nervous -- it looks as if he is about
to crash into the rock-face

--But it’s a PROJECTION The jet flies straight through

162 INT VALENTINE’S BASE -- NIGHT 162

The Jet lands Smartly-dressed GREETERS wearing ear-pieces
walk over to welcome the newcomers

INT CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

Banks of TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT in here On a MONITOR a live
feed of a landing strip The pilot PASSENGERS and Greeters

Valentine is in here with Gazelle

VALENTINE
How many More are we expecting

GAZELLE
Not many Most have their own
bunkers I figure were just
getting the really nervous ones

163 INT HUNTSMAN JET - SUNRISE 163

Merlin is in scientific mode dissecting the inner workings
of the PHONE and HEADSET as Roxy and Eggsy watch

MERLIN
It seems the earpiece can emit some
kind of counter-signal to ensure
the wearer is unaffected by the
waves from the sim cards

ROXY
The ones that turn everyone into a
psycho-killer

MERLIN
Quite Presumably it’s just a
precaution And as I suspected it
can also super-heat the wearer’s
soft tissue in the event that they
blab to the wrong people

EGGSY
How does this help us right now

MERLIN
It doesn’t I’m just tinkering
while I wait for the phone to
reverse-locate the most accessible
satellites in Valentines chain

EGGSY
So we take out the satellites

MERLIN
Well only have time to take out
one

(MORE )

MERLIN (CONTD)

But that’ll break the chain and
stop the signal And you’ll have
dealt with Valentine before he can
do anything about it

EGGSY
Wait how do we take out a —--

A RED LIGHT starts to flash and Merlin interrupts

MERLIN
Got it Brace yourself for landing

Through the plane window all Eggsy can see ig a DESERTED
ROAD in the middle of nowhere They’re landing on it

EXT DESERTED ROAD - SUNRISE 164

Eggsy and Roxy disembark confused and apprehensive Merlin
follows carrying the odd Exoskeleton that Eggsy retrieved

MERLIN
Lancelot put this on

ROXY
What is it

MERLIN
It was developed as part of
Reagans Star Wars project but
ultimately rejected It’s quite
basic but it should still work

Roxy reluctantly gets in Merlin operates some VALVES A HISS
of gasses and huge METALLIC BALLOONS start to inflate

MERLIN (CONT’D)

When you reach the edge of the
atmosphere the balloons will
implode So youll need to deploy
your missile just before that

ROKY
The edge of the atmosphere

MERLIN
After youve deployed youll need
to release for your descent Fast
Roxy starts rising balloons near full Eggsy grabs her hand

EGGSY
You can do this

She smiles gratefully nods And he lets go Roxy lifts off

MERLIN
Stop gaping Eggsy Time is not our
friend Go and get ready

Wish I could say the same right
now

MERLIN

Youre doing great Not much
further to go Youre up next
Eggsy Valentine’s base is in that

INT VALENTINE’S BASE - DAY 169

hands over his phone to one of them She taps the keypad to
check something on it then hands it back to him

FIRST GREETER
Follow me sir And your pilots are
most welcome to make themselves at
home in the staff refectory

One Greeter ushers the Pilots away to a SECURITY SCANNER as
the First Greeter walks Eggsy to ANOTHER SECURITY SCANNER

FIRST GREETER (CONT’D)
Just a formality I’m sure youve
adhered to our no-weapons policy I
do apologize for the inconvenience
EGGSY passes through the scanner
The Greeter leads Eggsy to a waiting MINI-MOKE They get in
and drive off

INT VALENTINE’S HO LOBBY - DAY 170

They drive into a vast lobby It looks like the lobby of a
five star hotel Numerous members of THE ELITE gathered here

Eggsy gets out and strolls through the room doing a great
job of looking like he belongs He passes a sumptuous buffet
He’s eyeing a CARVING KNIFE on it when A BUTLER approaches

HQ BUTLER
Would sir like a drink

EGGSY
Dalmore whiskey no ice Anda
splash of room temperature water

The Butler looks impressed Eggsy walks off and continues to
subtly scope out the room Finally he spots A TEXAS OIL
BARON sitting alone on a couch using a LAPTOP

Eggsy makes a beeline takes a seat beside him The butler
serves Eggsy his drink Eggsy nods his thanks takes a sip
Then he raises his glass in toast to the Texan

EGGSY (CONTD)
Society is dead Long live society

TEXAN
Amen to that My oil won’t be worth
shit but Ill be king of Texas
Bobby Getty
The Texan offers his hand Merlin comes on to Eggsy’s comms

TEXAN

Valentine’s my nephew lent me one
of his Private network I guess

EGGSY
Ah Do you need a light

TEXAN

Eggsy shoots him with a dart from his LIGHTER He snatches
the laptop from the slumped Texan quickly inserts A DONGLE

Eggsy gets up And is floored by a PUNCH
He looks up to see Charlie Charlie leans down talks low
the carving knife we saw before pressed to Eggsy’s throat

CHARLIE
Theres no way anyone would want a
low life you to be part of the new
world So I assume you cheated your
way to becoming a Huntsman

EGGSY
Eh What are you doing here

CHARLIE
My family were invited Obviously
(seeing Eggsy reach for
his pocket)
Not so fast

Charlie reaches into Egqgsy’s pocket and pulls out a bottle
of aftershave He smirks relieved and amused

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Hoping to mask your stench were
you You’ll need this even more
when you’re rotting in jail

Eggsy wriggles away squeezes his cuff-links and
BOOM The bottle EXPLODES in Charlie’s hand

GUESTS run GUARDS run over The time for blending in has
passed Eggsy slips the laptop behind the couch and runs too

In the chaos he manages to lose his pursuers At the edge of
