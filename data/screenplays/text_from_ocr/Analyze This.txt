MANETTA (VOCONTD)

asshole thought it would be a good
idea to have this meeting at Joe
Babaras farm in the country where
nobody would notice

EXT RURAL GAS STATION - DAY

A local state police deputy is gassing up his motorcycle
when the parade of shiny black cars rolls by He looks
up and scratches his head at the unusual sight

MANETTA (VO)
Turns out the local cops were
watching Joe Babara like a hawk
So now you got about fifty Caddies
and Lincolns pullin into Apalachin
and some deputy sheriff with cow
shit on his shoes notices all the
traffic and calls the Feds

EXT JOE BABARAS ESTATE - DAY

The Caddies and Lincolns are all parked around a rambling
country manor Bosses and wiseguys are meeting and
greeting each other on the big front porch

One WISEGUY is trying to shoo a cow away from his car

started The Feds moved in --

EXT HOUSE - DAY

Agents with weapons drawn charge the house and start
breaking down the front door

Gangsters in shiny suits are squeezing through windows

and leaping off balconies

WIDE - WISEGUYS
fleeing into the surrounding woods and fields

MANETTA (VO)
Your papa and me hid in a field
with hay or corn some kinda
foliage I dont know

EXT FARM FIELD - DAY

Two wiseguys in suits crouch in the tall grass
Suddenly they see a John Deere harvester bearing down on
them

MANETTA (VO)
Then along comes this farmer who
almost runs us over in a tractor
so your father hauls out his piece
this 44 cannon he used to carry
and hijacks the goddamn tractor
Funniest fuckin thing I ever saw

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
The farmer goes flying off the harvester and the two

wiseguys drive off on it

The farmer looks up to see the John Deere disappear in a
swirling cloud of dust that FILLS the SCREEN

commission tried to meet -- until
now
VITTI
(brooding)

I dont know I dont like it

MANETTA
The 57 meeting was about how we
were going to divide up the whole
country This meeting is about
how were gonna survive You got
made guys informing for the
Feds bosses going to jail
everybodys dealing drugs people
are getting whacked without
permission And on top of

We need a leader Someone with
fresh ideas Someone like you

him Id always look out for you

table Bodyguards follow them to the door The waiters
and the owner bow to them as they pass They are almost
out the door when Vitti hesitates

VITTI

grab a toothpick

The instant he steps back inside Manetta and his
bodyguard are struck by an incredible VOLLEY of GUNFIRE
which BLOWS OUT all the GLASS in the DOOR and WINDOWS

Vittis bodyguard JELLY grabs him and throws him behind
the counter shielding him with his body

Outside the shooting has stopped and curious bystanders
are looking in the broken windows Vittis eyes well up
with tears

CAROLINE

(weepy)
I kept telling him that I needed
room to grow and find myself as a
person Not just as a woman but
as an independent entity

BEN SOBOL
her therapist seems to be listening intently
CAROLINE

I told him I needed to get in
touch with my uniqueness but he

couldnt handle that He said I
was driving him away Do you
think I was driving him away Dr
Sobol

Ben leans forward sympathetically

Hes in his mid-forties has an expressive face and a
quick wit and despite the occasional lapse he is a
gifted and caring psychologist

BEN
Things end Caroline Thats just
a part of life Its how we deal
with things ending thats important

CAROLINE
I just cant believe its over between
me and Steve Maybe theres still
hope

BEN
Well he did take out a restraining
order against you I have to be

sign

CAROLINE

thing you have to do

(voice rising)

is stop whining about this

queen

(mocking)
Steve doesnt respect me Steve
doesnt love me anymore Who gives

boring human being I have ever met

before I lapse into a goddamn coma

Caroline looks curiously at Ben unperturbed

CAROLINE
Dr Sobol

BEN

Lost in his fantasy not really listening He comes
to attention and tries to cover

mouth

Michaels room)

tied to a chair under a strong overhead light When he
speaks we get a hint of mental incompetence

NICKY

Please Mr Vitti I told em I

believe me cause that one time I
said Little Joe hit Dukey and it

turned out he didnt but I didnt
know because --

JIMMY
(smacks him)

steps aside and Vitti moves close holding a short length
of lead pipe

VITTI

you if you lie to me right

wince in anticipation of the blow But Vitti just
freezes there with his arm upraised Then he drops his
arm and seems to sag

VITTI
Forget about it He doesnt know
anything

He tosses the pipe aside

VITTI
Get him outta here

Jimmy looks at Jelly in surprise

each other and we didnt think
anybody would be into wearing any
fucking name tags

Laughter around the table
Sindone stands up and looks straight at Ben

SINDONE
Im Primo Sindone They call me
Sonny Long Its good to see so
many of the old faces here and to
welcome the new ones from all over
the country I see Frank Zello
and Joe Baldassare but Ima
little disappointed to see that
the head of our other New York
family isnt here today All I
see is his man Jelly and some
sawed-off little prick nobody
knows

Jelly looks at Ben waiting for him to speak but Ben
just sits frozen looking down at his hands

JELLY
(stands up rattled)
Yeah well the thing is Mr Vitti
has been detained and he sends his

apologies for -- being detained --
and he apologizes for his --
detainment

SINDONE

Detained What kind of bullshit

is that Whats more important
than this As the host of this
meeting I take his not being here
as a sign of disrespect to me and
to all these other men too who
came a long way to be here

JELLY
Mr Vitti meant no disrespect
The thing is hes not feeling

well Hes sick and he -- didnt
feel well --

108 Ben rises and slaps Jelly hard across the face

BEN
(quietly)
Jelly We dont ever discuss Mr
Vittis health outside the family
You know better

Jelly is stunned The bosses murmur

SINDONE

BEN

BEN

(slaps him again)

involved in all aspects of the
family business and Im prepared
to speak for Mr Vitti on all
matters

SINDONE
Okay Doctor then lets get down

and Paul Vitti for a long time

BEN

thing

SINDONE

He tugs meaningfully on his earlobe

SINDONE
What guy

BEN
The guy with the thing

SINDONE
What thing What the fuck are you

BEN

(gestures helplessly

to the others)
This is the whole problem You
cant have an intelligent
conversation with the man

SINDONE
How about if I just break your
fuckin neck What do you think
of that

BEN
Its not important what I think

SINDONE

Sindone turns to a couple of other bosses FRANK ZELLO
and JOE BALDASSARE

SINDONE

ZELLO

tendency to get angry a lot

BALDASSARE

SINDONE

BEN

not worthy enough to be talked
about

SINDONE
What does that mean

BEN
What do you think it means

SINDONE
Fuck you

ZELLO
Primo calm down SINDONE

Calm down How can I calm down
when this prick wont stop with
the questions

BEN

SINDONE

Sindone whips out a pistol and points it at Ben but just
as hes about to shoot --

VITTI (0S)
Primo

All eyes turn

109 PAUL VITTI

Hes standing there staring at Sindone cool clear and
unafraid He looks like a king The room goes silent
Vitti looks around the table nods and crosses to Ben
Jelly gets up to greet him

VITTI
(quietly to Jelly)
Wait outside with the car running

Jelly nods and exits

BEN
What are you doing here

VITTI
Saving your ass Sit down Tll
take it from here

Ben sits greatly relieved

VITTI

(to the group)
Im Paul Vitti Im sorry I was
late Those of you who know me
will know I meant no disrespect
If its all right with you
theres something Id like to say
then Ill leave you to your
business

Ben looks at Vitti and sees a kind of serenity and
clarity hes never seen before

VITTI
About two and a half weeks ago
somebody killed my friend Dominic
Manetta

He looks straight at Sindone

SINDONE
Dont look at me Everybody knows
you whacked him so you could take
over everything

VITTI
What I really came here to say is
that Ive come to a very important
decision in my life I want out

A great murmur of surprise sweeps around the room

looks at him proudly

VITTI
Im going away for a while but I
will respect the oath I took the
day I was made and whatever I
know about anyone elses business
I take with me to the grave You
have my word

A negative buzz among the bosses

VITTI
As for my own organization I know
Carlo Mangano would like to be the
new boss

Mangano smiles gratefully

MANGANO
Thank you Paul

VITTI
Thats why he betrayed Dominic and
me to our enemies and sent his own
man to kill me in Miami

Ben

Mangano is stunned

VITTI
But I leave it to my people to
deal with that and choose their
own boss And even though its my
right I wont take revenge
mostly because Im in a good place
mentally and feeling good about me

ZELLO
(perplexed)
I dont know Paul I can see
where some people might have a
problem with this

VITTI

I realize that so as an extra
token of good faith between us
Ive taken the liberty of writing
down everything I know and putting
it in a safe deposit box in case
anything happens to me or my
family

Theres a long tense silence while the other bosses
consider all this Then finally --

ZELLO
I dont know what anybody else
thinks but I say good luck and
God bless Paul

BALDAS SARE
Good luck Paul Salut

They all raise their glasses and toast Vitti Ben raises
his glass to Vitti and drinks

BEN
(to Vitti)

Vitti smiles at him and drinks
