Fade from studio logos
Blackness Silence for a moment

Studio credits appear on screen as the noise of computers
clicking telephones ringing and people chattering with each
other begins to grow

The names of the three lead actors appear on screen for a moment
before it slowly fades to

Int NASA control center —- communications room

There are several long desks with the newest high-tech
computers placed on them On the large wall in front of all the
computer desks there are several large TV screens with 3D models
of space on the screens There are also a few dozen engineers
and astronomers in the room

Focus on one technician at a computer

The TECHNICIAN types at the computer a tired look on his face
Suddenly a flashing white light illuminates his face
accompanied by a beeping sound

The Technician’s eyes widen as he sits up at the desk and types
on the keyboard for a moment After another moment the
Technician stands up out of his chair

Technician
Mr Brown I need you to take a look at this

After a moment NASA Director Marcus Brown (mid-40’s) walks up
to the Technician Brown looks like the kind of guy who worked
extremely hard to get to where he is today and he doesn’t plan
to quit anytime soon

Brown
Yes what is it

Technician
Mr Brown several of our satellites that were taking pictures
of Alpha Centauri saw this

The Technician presses a button on the computer On one of the
large TV screens on the wall an image appears The image shows a
small oval shaped bright object Brown the Technician and
everyone else in the room looks up at the TV screen They all
seemed shocked and confused

Brown
Jesus

Technician
Apparently that’s not the only image

Several more images appear on the screen They all show the
object getting larger and larger in each picture

Brown
What is it

Technician
Unknown From what I’ve read all of these images where taken
within the last half hour

The Technician turns and looks back at the computer screen

Brown
Where is it headed

The Technician sits down in the chair continuing to type on the
keyboard and reading over data on the screen

After a moment the Technician looks up at Brown

Technician
It’s heading towards Earth

Brown looks at the computer screen then back up at the TV
screens

Brown
How big is it

Technician
It’s no bigger than a hundred sixty feet across (pause) And by
the looks of it the object should enter our atmosphere

The Technician’s eyes widen in shock Brown looks over at the
Technician after a moment

Brown
When
Technician (shocked)
Within the next few hours

Every other person in the room gasps after hearing the news
After a moment the Technician looks up at Brown

Technician
What are we gonna do sir

Brown
Confirm this information as quickly as possible then inform the
President about the situation Let him decide what will happen
next

Brown continues to look up at the image of the glowing object
Focus on him for a moment then cut to

walked by it this morning and saw that it was a mess

Andrew

sitting The look on her face says that she was hoping that it
would have gone better

shines its light onto the building The streets and highways
surrounding the Pentagon are not jam packed yet but rush hour
is starting

Int Pentagon - underground hallway

In the dull cement covered underground hallway Secretary of
Defense JACOB PATTERSON (mid 40’s) stands close to a steel door
He looks down at the floor deep in thought Patterson is
wearing a dark blue formal suit completed with a red tie

After a moment the steel door opens and NASA director Brown
General George O’NEIL (late 60’s) and Vice President MELINDA
HARVARD (mid 40’s) walk through the doorway General O’Neil is
holding a dark brown folder in his hand VP Harvard is wearing a
black shirt over a formal red skirt that goes down to her knees
Her hair is tied up behind her head

Patterson
Madame Vice President

VP Harvard
Mr Patterson I guess you’ve been informed on what’s heading
towards Earth

Patterson
To a degree

Patterson looks over at General O’Neil and Brown General O’Neil
reaches over and shakes Patterson’s hand

General O’Neil (to Patterson)
Mr Secretary (motions to Brown) this is Marcus Brown He is
the director of NASA

Patterson reaches over and shakes Brown’s hand

Brown
Mr Secretary I’m sorry that we have to meet under these
conditions

All four of them start to walk down the hallway

Patterson
Alright I want to be fully brought up to speed on what’s going
on Is this object in anyway connected to the massive blackouts
occurring all over Asia Europe and Australia

General O’Neil
Well considering that the object entered our atmosphere about
an hour ago we have

Patterson (cutting him off)
Wait it’s already entered the planet’s atmosphere

Brown
Yes

VP Harvard
What the President and I want to know is where is it now and
where is it heading

General O’Neil
We lost communications with British Prime Minister Brown five
minutes ago

They all stop walking VP Harvard looks at General O’Neil
somewhat shocked

VP Harvard
What

General O’Neil
It’s official all of Europe is experiencing some kind of
blackout

Patterson
Is it just a normal blackout or is it something more

General O’Neil
From the small amount of information we have its more like an
EMP

VP Harvard
A what

Brown
It’s an electromagnetic pulse It shuts off all electrical
equipment for a short amount of time Cars watches cell
phones land lines everything

Patterson
Well that explains why no information what so ever is coming
out of the entire eastern hemisphere

VP Harvard (slightly disturbed)
Jesus

Brown Patterson General O’Neil and VP Harvard continue walking
down the hallway

General O’Neil
We have reasons to believe that the object is heading towards
the eastern sea coast

Patterson
What are our options

VP Harvard
We can’t afford to have this object or what ever it is enter
restricted United States airspace This thing cannot be allowed
to show air superiority over any major metropolitan area

General O’Neil
Madame Vice President Mr Secretary this thing has already
done that over half of this planet We can’t expect to see a
different outcome when it enters American airspace

They all walk up to another steel door Patterson presses a few
buttons on a keyboard on the wall next to the door The door
slides open and all four of them enter the room

Int Pentagon - Underground intelligence briefing room

Inside the room is a semi-large oval shaped table On the walls
are flat screen TV’s showing images of the glowing object in

space Sitting at the table are Howard Benson and Secretary of
Homeland Security ADAM MARLOWE (mid 40’s) Marlowe adjusts his

glasses as VP Harvard General O’Neil Patterson and Brown walk
into the room

Everyone sits down at the table and look at each other for a
brief moment

VP Harvard
It’s good to see you Adam

Marlowe

Nice to see you again Melinda (to everyone else) This is
Howard Benson He is an expert on advanced communications I
felt that with the possibility of this object being
extraterrestrial it would be best to have Mr Benson with us

VP Harvard
It’s a pleasure to meet you Mr Benson

Howard
Mrs Harvard I’m honored to meet you as well

VP Harvard
Alright if this thing is heading towards the eastern sea coast
we need to come up with some kind of plan to deal with it Any
ideas

Patterson
Well first off we need to get the First Family to a secure
location until we can determine if this object is hostile in any
way

Marlowe
We may not have time to transport the First Family

VP Harvard
President Reeves wants to receive constant updates concerning
this situation Everything we know he wants to know as well
You all know how he hates being left out of the loop when it
comes to matters of nation security

General O’Neil
Before this thing enters our airspace we need to ready our
missile defense system immediately We need to stay on the side
of caution

Howard raises his hand slightly Everyone looks at him for a
moment after which he lowers his hand

Howard
Can I say something

Marlowe
Go ahead Mr Benson

Howard
Well if this thing is extraterrestrial in origin I don’t
think we should greet an alien being with missiles and gun fire
We don’t want to screw up our first impressions do we

General O’Neil smiles at the comment

General O’Neil
We can’t go into this situation expecting any intelligent
extraterrestrial life to be like ET or the friendly big-headed
aliens from Close Encounters

Howard
I didn’t say we should completely let our guard down All I’m
suggesting is that we let them make the first move

General O’Neil

They already have They’ve cut off communications with half of
the world They have shut down our missile defense capabilities
in Europe and knocked out all communications to and from the
Middle East The entire eastern half of the world is in total
darkness and we have no idea what is happening

That shuts Howard up He sits back in his chair and decides to
let the big boys figure this out General O’Neil turns and looks
over at VP Harvard

General O’Neil

Madame Vice President we need to get the President and his
family to a secure location then immediately ready all of our
defense systems to prepare for a possible assault by this
object

Howard seems almost offended at what is being planned but
continues to sit back in his chair Suddenly a younger man ina
formal suit enters the briefing room walks over to Patterson
and whispers into his ear for a moment

Everyone turns and looks at Patterson After a moment the
younger man stands up straight and takes a few steps back behind
Patterson

Patterson
Whatever we’re gonna do we need to do it fast

Marlowe
What happened

Patterson
All of Maine and parts of eastern Canada are experiencing the
same thing that is happening in Europe and Asia It’s here and
apparently the object is heading this way

Everyone in the room seems overwhelmed after hearing this
information Focus on them for a brief moment

blackboard In the classroom there are about 20 students
sitting most of them are facing Helen and writing in their
notebooks In the back row there are two guys and one girl (all
of them are 14-15 years old) that are talking amongst each
other

Helen finishes up writing the word TOLERANCE on the blackboard
She turns and looks at her class

Helen
Alright I know that this may seem like a stupid thing to ask
but does anyone know what tolerance means

A TEENAGE GIRL raises her hand Helen smiles pointing at her

Helen
Yes Katie

Teenage girl
To be respectful of other people’s beliefs

Helen
That is correct The textbook definition is to recognize and
respect the opinions practices and behaviors of others

deep voice) “Yo girl this is James from school You need to
stop cheating on your boyfriend He’1ll be pissed if he finds out
that you’ve been sleeping with Scott for the past few months”

Erin and Max try not to laugh out loud but they can’t help it
Several of the other students turn around and look at them
along with Helen

Helen (semi-annoyed)

Max Erin and David turn and look at Helen

Max
Yes Mrs Benson

Helen
I know that sociology isn’t the most exciting class but it sure
ain’t the funniest

Max
I’m sorry Mrs Benson

Erin
Yeah Max and David are bad influences on me

Max and David chuckle to themselves Even Erin can’t keep a
straight face Helen turns and looks at the blackboard again

After a moment Max David and Erin turn to face each other
again Now they speak in lowered voice

Max
So what did she say after that

David reaches into his back pants pocket and pulls out his cell
phone

David
I couldn’t help myself I recorded the whole conversation This
bitch flips the fuck out I’m not kidding

these beings do try to make contact with us we’1ll consult you

In the park there appears to be what looks like a large
silvery-metallic object about 150 feet across hovering just
slightly above the ground It looks almost like a giant
metallic tortoise shell However even though it is metallic in
appearance it also seems to be somewhat translucent with small
patches of pulsating light popping up randomly all over the
object

The voice of the News Anchor seems startled but he is keeping
his calm

Voice of News Anchor

You are currently looking at live images of what looks like a
large object in the downtown Washington area The object is
approximately a hundred or so feet across This breaking news
story is very scary indeed

Helen sits down on the couch her eyes still transfixed on the
TV screen After a moment Andrew turns and looks at his mother

Andrew
Mom are we gonna die

Helen
I’m sure that they won’t hurt us They wouldn’t have come all
this way to hurt us

Helen wraps her arm around Andrew’s shoulder and pulls him
closer to her Both of them continue to watch the TV screen for
a few moments

Focus on TV The large object continues to hover just slightly
above the ground in the downtown Washington DC park

Voice of News Anchor

has called for calm and patience as they deal with this
situation It is believed by several reports that we are
receiving that the object is in fact extraterrestrial in nature
and that the President has called for the National Guard and all
local law enforcements to be on high alert

A montage of shots

-A long procession of military personnel carriers humvees and
police cruisers driving into the park and stopping about a
hundred feet away from the ship

-Dozens of soldiers jumping off of the personnel carriers and
running to form a defensive line around the ship raising their

assault rifles and aiming them at the large ship

-several police cruisers driving on the grass of the park their
sirens blaring and redblue lights flashing

-More shots of military vehicles driving on the grass moving
towards the large ship Gunners on top of the humvees ready the
machine guns that are mounted to the vehicles

-A shot of a tank pulling up next to a humvee It rocks back and
forth slightly as it comes to a stop

-several soldiers carrying shoulder mounted missile launchers
rushing towards the defensive line set up in front of the ship

-Several black vans pulling up next to a park picnic table The
doors slide open and several scientists in hazmat suits step out
of the vans

Ext Ariel view of large open park - Early Afternoon

A large thick circle of military vehicles and police cruisers
along with (possibly) hundreds of soldiers surrounds the large
tortoise shell-shaped object After a moment a TV news
helicopter flies over the ship

Ext Large open park - Early Afternoon

Focus on a group of soldiers maybe six of them slowly walking
towards the ship Walking along side the soldiers is one of the
scientists’ in a hazmat suit looking up at the ship in awe
(this would be my small cameo role)

The large object continues to glow with the small patches of
light popping up all over the ship The soldiers and the
scientist in the hazmat suit continue to walk towards the front
of the ship slowly

Scientist in hazmat suit
I’m detecting small amounts of radiation coming off of the ship
but it is no where near a lethal amount

They continue approaching the ship

Voice in radio (os)
At the sign of any form of aggression turn back immediately

Scientist in hazmat suit
Affirmative We are going to proceed towards the craft

The soldiers and the scientist in the hazmat suit continue to
walk towards the ship Suddenly the front part of the ship’s
underbelly begins to glow brightly It is followed by a soft
buzzing noise

The soldiers and the scientist in the hazmat suit raise their
arms up to the eyes for a moment The scientist in the hazmat
suit lowers his arm and looks into the light and after a moment
his eyes widen and his mouth drops open

Scientist in Hazmat suit POV a figure literally materializes
out of the bright light coming from the ship It stands about 30
feet away from the scientist in the hazmat suit It looks like
it is wearing some sort of skin tight dark green colored suit
which appears to be covered in some kind of armor The figure
also looks like it is wearing some kind of helmet over its head
which has a thin black visor where it’s eyes would be

The soldiers with the scientist look at the figure in shock for
a moment then immediately raise their assault rifles and aim
them at the figure which appears to be standing six feet tall

The scientist in the hazmat suit overcome with awe begins to
walk slowly towards the figure As he walks towards it the

voices over the radio seem to grow in intensity

Voices over radio (0s)

Stand back Stand back What are our rules of engagement
Do not fire Repeat do not fire What is that thing
Everyone hold your positions Do not let your guard down

The scientist in the hazmat suit and the strange figure are now
only standing ten feet apart from each other The scientist in
the hazmat suit slowly raises his hand towards the strange
figure in what looks like an attempt to shake hands with the
strange figure (for those of you who don’t know the strange
figure is KLAATU in a suit)

The figure (Klaatu) takes a few more steps towards the scientist
and raises his arm as well The dark green colored suit looks
like it is actually sparkling in the light

Voices over radio (0s)
Step away Continue to aim at the target Everyone do not
fire We have contact with the target Do not show
hostility towards the target

Suddenly there is a deafening sound almost like a gun shot
The scientist in hazmat suit flinches in response to the sound
He takes a step back before looking up at Klaatu

Klaatu is clutching his left shoulder as he falls to his knees
The scientist in hazmat suit stares at Klaatu in shock for a
moment Klaatu looks down at the ground then up at the
scientist in hazmat suit before finally falling onto his side

Voices over radio (0s)
Everyone hold your fire now Call for a medic
immediately Has the target been hit Clear out the
nearest high level security medical facility

The scientist in the hazmat suit rushes over to Klaatu followed
by several soldiers with their assault rifles aimed at the
figure laying on the ground

The scientist in hazmat suit kneels down on the ground and
carefully turns Klaatu’s head to face his own A look of shock
sadness and guilt is all over the scientist’s face

Scientist in hazmat suit
I’m sorry

Suddenly there is another loud sound almost like that of a jet
engine Everyone reaches up to try and cover their ears

Montage of shots

-the soldiers in the humvees letting go over the mounted guns
and covering their ears

-police officers standing next to their police cars their hands
tightly pressed against their ears

The scientist in the hazmat suit finally turns and looks towards
the ship

Standing in front of the ship silhouetted against the bright
light is a much taller darker figure This one stands at least
17 or 18 feet tall This figure is completely covered in black
which also seems to sparkle like glitter in the light and it
looks like it is built to resemble a pro-football quarterback in
appearance physically

It is GORT GORT takes a single step away from the ship and
turns his completely blank head and face to turn and look around
at everyone

Suddenly a large but somewhat thin visor appears over GORT’Ss
face (it was completely covered in the black sparkling
material No face what so ever) and begins to glow brightly red

Suddenly a thin red beam of light briefly shoots out of the red
visor and strikes a humvee a hundred feet away The military
vehicle explodes into flames and smoke Soldiers and police
officers turn and run away

A second beam of red light shoots out of the visor and strikes a
second humvee It rapidly travels over to a police cruiser and
that vehicle explodes as well

The beams of light disappear but the visor over GORT’s face
continues to glow brightly GORT suddenly walks over to where
the scientist in the hazmat suit and Klaatu are The scientist
turns and looks up in shock at the giant robot

GORT stops walking turns and looks down at the scientist and
Klaatu The red light coming from the visor begins to glow
brighter and brighter accompanied by an electrical sizzling
sound

Suddenly Klaatu’s hands reach up grab a hold of the helmet and
rip it off revealing the kind human face of a man
approximately in his mid to late thirties

Klaatu
Gort Deklato prosko

The scientist turns and looks down at Klaatu then back up at

GORT GORT is standing upright looking straight ahead The red
visor has disappeared from GORT’s face and the giant robot seems
to stand motionless almost as if he is guarding the large ship

Ext Ariel view of large open park - early afternoon

robot is motionless and the soldiers police officers and other

scientists are standing still staring up at GORT

Int Benson House - kitchen - Early Afternoon

Helen is standing in front of the kitchen sink with her cell
phone in her hand and held up to her ear

Helen
I know I know Dad I’m gonna wait for him to call me Do you
think that Andrew and I could come over for the next few days or
until this thing comes to an endThank you Dad soo much I
don’t know if Howard will be home by the time we leave I think
that he’s involved somehow Ok I’11 call you when we’re on
our way I love you Dad Bye

Helen closes the phone and puts it in her pants pocket She
looks out at the backyard through the window After a brief
moment the faint sound of a jet flying overhead is heard

Helen turns and walks out of the kitchen and into the front
hallway

Int Benson house - Andrew’s bedroom - Early Afternoon

Andrew is laying on his bed staring up blankly at the ceiling
After a moment Helen walks in and looks down at her son

Helen
Andrew

Andrew turns and looks at his mother

Andrew
Yeah Mom

Helen
Pack up a couple days worth of shirts pants and underwear
We’re going to Grandpa’s until this thing is dealt with

Andrew
You mean until the spaceship leaves

Helen
Yeah

Andrew
What about Dad

Helen
I don’t know I’m gonna wait as long as possible for him to call
us I doubt that he’1ll be home by the time we leave

Andrew sits up turns and sits on the edge of his bed Helen
walks over to his bed and sits down next to her son

Helen (cont’d)
Do you wanna talk about it I know that you’re scared So am I
If you wanna talk it’s ok

Andrew looks down at he bedroom floor not saying a word After
a moment Helen turns and looks up at the dresser next to
Andrew’s bed On the dresser there are a few pictures of Helen
Howard and Andrew

Focus on pictures Focus on a specific picture showing Helen
sitting on a couch looking up at the camera and smiling Andrew
is sitting next to Helen also smiling up at the camera He has
his hand over her stomach In the picture Helen seems maybe
five or six months pregnant

Helen turns and looks at Andrew He is still staring at he
ground After a moment Helen stands up and walks over to
Andrew’s open closet Andrew looks up at Helen

After a moment Helen pulls out a small blue suitcase She
carries it over to the bed and sets it down on the bed

Helen
I’m gonna go into our bedroom and pack a suitcase as well
Please be finished in a half hour ok

Andrew nods his head yes Helen turns and walks out of the
bedroom

Int Walter Reed facility - underground hallway

In this hallway instead of concrete it is made up of steel
There are three doors in the hallway (disregarding the one at
the end of the hallway) one of the right side of the hallway
the other two on the opposite sides

The door at the end of the hallway opens and VP Harvard
Patterson General O’Neil and PRESIDENT ALEXANDER REEVES (early
40’s) walk into the hallway Pres Reeves is wearing a black
suit with a blue business tie

Pres Reeves
Patterson what’s the latest that we know

Patterson
Mr President after the being left the space craft and the
large automaton emerged and attacked our soldiers it ceased its
attack and for the past hour or so it has not moved at all

Pres Reeves
How’s the EBE doing

Patterson
What sir

Pres Reeves
The extraterrestrial biological entity How is the being doing

VP Harvard
It was sedated during the operation to remove the bullet

Pres Reeves
Was the operation a success

VP Harvard
It couldn’t have been better

General O’Neil
It’s just up ahead Mr President

They continue walking towards the door on the right General
O’Neil walks ahead of the President and opens up the door Pres
Reeves VP Harvard and Patterson walk into the room followed by
General O’Neil

Int Walter Reed facility - underground observation room

As Pres Reeves walks into the room he turns and notices
Marlowe and Howard standing looking at another room on the
other side of a large glass window Marlowe and Howard turn and
face Pres Reeves Behind the President the other three enter
the room and the door closes

Pres Reeves (to Howard)
Who might you be

Howard
Mr President my name is Howard Benson

Marlowe
I felt that we could use his communications skills to help us
with this situation

Pres Reeves nods his head then turns and walks over to the
glass window In the other room are several doctors examining
Klaatu who is strapped to a hospital bed with a raised head
rest He appears to be unconscious his eyes are closed He is
wearing just a typical blue patient’s gown

Pres Reeves
That’s him isn’t it

Marlowe
Yes Mr President

Pres Reeves
But he looks like one of us Is his DNA human

Howard
No it’s not That’s what makes him soo interesting He looks
human but his DNA is soo different from ours

Everyone in the room looks at the glass window for a moment

Pres Reeves
I want to talk to him personally

Int Walter Reed Facility - underground examination room

Focus on Klaatu’s face His eyes are still closed but they
moving underneath his eye lids Suddenly his eyes snap open

Pres Reeves Marlowe Howard General O’Neil and several
soldiers and Secret Service Guards are standing in the room
look at Klaatu

Klaatu slowly turns and carefully looks at everyone After a
moment Pres Reeves takes a cautious step towards Klaatu

Pres Reeves
Can you understand us

Klaatu looks at Pres Reeves and nods his head

Klaatu
Perfectly

Everyone in the room seems slightly shocked that he speaks
English but it passes

Pres Reeves
I see that you can speak our language

Klaatu
My people have been studying this planet for a long time We
know more than just how to speak in your tongues

Pres Reeves takes a quick deep breath then breathes out
Pres Reeves

My name is Alexander Reeves I’m the President of the United
States of America

Klaatu smiles warmly

Klaatu
I am honored to finally meet one of the many distinguished
leaders this planet has to offer

Pres Reeves
Do you have a name as well

Klaatu
Yes Klaatu

Everyone briefly looks at everyone else then back at Klaatu
Pres Reeves
I would like to personally express my deepest apology for what

happened back in the park

Klaatu
I understand It was expected

Pres Reeves
What

Klaatu

We have studied this planet for quite some time and we knew that
your species is you use the words “trigger happy” You

position your fingers on the triggers before you even understand
the situation you are dealing with

Pres Reeves seems a bit taken aback by the comment After a

moment General O’Neil steps forward

General O’Neil
Do you understand the impact on this planet that your arrival
has caused

Klaatu
Fully I’ve never seen soo much panic before
planet has never sat down with another civilization
understood what would happen and the results of my arrival
expected as well

but since this
we

were

General O’Neil
Where exactly do you come from

Klaatu
I come from a planet that orbits the star you call Alpha
Centauri I like to think of Earth as a new neighbor that we
haven’t welcomed to the neighborhood

General O’Neil smiles

General O’Neil
Its rather difficult for us to think of a distant planet as a
neighbor

Klaatu
I’m afraid in the present situation you will have to learn to
think that way rather quickly

General O’Neil
The present situation

Klaatu
I mean the reason why I came to this planet

General O’Neil
The United States Government and the US Military is very curious
about that

Klaatu
I’d be glad to speak about it but not here with just you
people
General O’Neil takes another step towards Klaatu

General O’Neil

Why not
Klaatu
If our studies are correct your people have a “United
Nations” Is that organization still in operation

Pres Reeves
Yes

Klaatu
I will discuss my purpose there

Pres Reeves gives Klaatu a brief smile

Pres Reeves
I’m afraid that won’t happen

Klaatu
Why not

Pres Reeves
National Security issues We can’t just willing let an alien
being speak to the United Nations Why can’t you tell us your
purpose

Klaatu
The reason for me being on this planet is far too great to let
only the representatives of one nation know about it I must
speak to representatives from all the nations of Earth

Pres Reeves

The current struggles that our world is going through it
would be impossible for representatives from every nation on
Earth to agree to lay down their weapons and listen to a alien
visitor

Klaatu
My mission concerns all life on this planet Human animal
marine plant life Everything that lives on this planet is in
danger and is threatened by extinction

Howard takes a few steps towards Klaatu Klaatu turns and looks
at Howard

Howard
Please tell us If its that important

Klaatu
I’m sorry but I will not speak to one nation alone Either the
whole world hears it or no one does

Everyone stares at Klaatu slightly stunned about what Klaatu
has said about the human race

Pres Reeves
May you excuse us for a moment

Klaatu nods his head
Int Walter Reed facility - underground observation room

Pres Reeves Howard General O’Neil Marlowe and Patterson are
standing outside the examination room Klaatu can be seen in the
examination room in the background looking around at everything
curiously

General O’Neil
I agree with you that we shouldn’t even consider using extreme
measures to get him to talk but we need to know what his
intentions are

Pres Reeves
I understand General

General O’Neil

He shut off global communications our defensive capabilities
entered the most sensitive airspace in the world and that large
automaton attacked our troops and blew up several military
vehicles Technically just the robot incident alone is an act
of war

Howard

We’re all jumping to conclusions He shut off power all over the
world so that he could arrive safely and the robot attacked in
an attempt to defend him apparently It was violent I know

but we fired the first shot remember

General O’Neil walks over to Pres Reeves

General O’Neil
Mr President I know that you look at the goodness in people
That’s what helped you get elected but we are dealing with an
alien representative who has technology that can shut off all
electrical power all over the world and he has in better terms
a weapon of mass destruction

Pres Reeves
I understand but I doubt that he will reveal his purpose on
Earth if we use violent measures We need to get him to trust
us not find ways to harm us

Howard
Harm us

General O’Neil turns and looks at Howard almost smirking

General O’Neil

I think we all understand to some degree his intentions on
Earth What he did before he arrived clearly showed that he
wanted to demonstrate superiority not just in the air but with
our power grids and defensive and military options

After a moment Howard walks into the center of the room and
turns to look at the President a little aggravated

Howard
Let me talk to him

Everyone turns and looks at Howard

General O’Neil
What

Howard

Let me talk to him Give me a chance to talk to him Maybe I can
get him to trust us Maybe I can get him to reveal his mission
since you won’t let him speak to the United Nations which I
personally think would be the best option Mr President I
think it would be best if you let an ordinary person talk to
him someone who he can learn to trust Please let me try Give
me one shot at it please

Howard continues to look over at Pres Reeves along with
everyone else in the room

Pres Reeves
Anything’s worth a shot You have my permission Mr Benson to
talk with Klaatu Get him to trust you Get him to reveal as
much as possible

Howard nods his head
Int Walter Reed facility - underground examination room

Klaatu is still strapped to the hospital bed It appears that
Klaatu is now hooked up to a polygraph machine a lie-detector
A small table with a computer screen showing a steady pulse is
set up next to Klaatu’s bed

After a moment Howard enters the room and slowly walks over to
Klaatu holding a clipboard in his hands Klaatu looks up at
Howard curiously Just by how Howard is walking shows that he
seems to be nervous in Klaatu’s presence

After a moment Klaatu slightly smiles

Klaatu
You look nervous

Howard
A little

Howard walks over to the metal table sits down at it and places
the clipboard down next to the computer screen Howard takes a
deep breath before looking up at Klaatu

Howard
I’m going to ask you a series of questions Please answer them
honestly and truthfully

Klaatu
I have been doing that the entire time Mr Benson

Howard appears stunned to hear Klaatu say his name

Howard
How do you know my name

Klaatu
My people have been studying this planet Mr Benson Remember
that

Int Walter Reed facility - underground observation room

Pres Reeves Patterson General O’Neil Marlowe and a doctor
are standing at the window watching what is going on in the
examination room

Marlowe
Mr President we have been receiving calls from the United
Kingdom Japan and France asking if they could send over some
of their top scientists to examine Klaatu and his ship

Pres Reeves
Not until we learn more about why he is here

After a brief moment VP Harvard walks into the room Everyone
turns and looks at her She appears to be a little stressed

VP Harvard
Alex we need to hold a press conference Soon

Pres Reeves
I understand

VP Harvard (cutting him off)

According to what I’ve been watching on the TV half the world
is thinking that this is the end of days The other half is
demanding to learn more about this guy We need to say
something to calm everyone down

After a moment everyone turns and looks back into the
examination room

Pres Reeves
Once we learn more we’ll hold a press conference

Int Walter Reed Facility - underground examination room

Howard is carefully looking back and forth at Klaatu then at
the computer screen set up on the desk

Howard
Are you in a seat of position on your planet’s government

Klaatu
Yes

Howard
What is that position

Klaatu
I am a representative to other planets

Howard quickly looks down at the clipboard then up at Klaatu
who is staring back at Howard but not in a frightening way He
is looking at Howard with a slightly sympathetic look

Klaatu
There is something bothering you Mr Benson I can tell by your
facial expressions while you have been talking to me

Howard stares at Klaatu for a moment then stands up out of his
chair

Int Walter Reed facility - underground observation room

Everyone’s eyes widen and General O’Neil takes a step towards
the door that leads to the examination room

Pres Reeves
Wait

Int Walter Reed Facility - underground examination room

Howard looks down at Klaatu trying to find the words that he
wants to say Klaatu looks up at him with a patient look on his
face

Howard
I’m gonna speak from my heart ok

Klaatu
Why should I mind All beings are their true selves when they
speak from the heart

Howard
When you came when I learned of what was happening I
thought the world was gonna come to an end today I was soo
scared not for me but for my family my wife my son My
family has gone through a tragedy over the last year and
today we are not the only ones who are scared The whole
planet is

Klaatu and Howard stare at each other for a moment

Klaatu
I understand that all people go through tragedies in their
lives The same goes for our world I wish and hoped that

your people wouldn’t have reacted with fear and aggression but
like I said before my arrival on this planet is the first of
its kind

Howard looks at the glass window then at Klaatu with a stern
look on his face

Howard
Tell us please I just wanna know Why have you come to our
planet

Klaatu stares at Howard for a moment then sighs

laatu
I came here to offer mankind two choices

Howard
What choices

laatu
Salvation or extermination

Klaatu said

Inside the communications room there are about a dozen or so
computers and several land line telephones attached to the wall

sense that he is scared

We’ re headed up to my father’s I called him and he said it
would be alright if we stayed with him until the situation gets
better or something

up at her

upset as well I’m sure everything will be alright in the end

After a brief moment there is a rapid beeping sound coming
through the phone Howard pulls the phone away and hangs it back
up on the wall receiver

He buries his face into his hands and stays like that for a
moment The sound of him sniffling can be faintly heard

Int Walter Reed Facility - underground communications room

Howard Marlowe General O’Neil and several soldiers are looking
up at a large flat screen TV hanging on the wall On the TV
Patterson is speaking to reporters about the situation via a
news conference

Marlowe
This wasn’t a good idea

Howard
Why not

Marlowe
We shouldn’t be speaking about the entity so soon after his
arrival Besides we don’t fully know why he is here

General O’Neil turns and looks at Marlowe and Howard

General O’Neil
He already revealed enough information Either we accept his
“salvation” or he will destroy us You heard him yourself Mr
Benson

Howard
We don’t know what he meant exactly

General O’Neil shakes his head turns and looks back at the TV
screen

General O’Neil
Mr Benson I know that you’re scared Do you really think that
the rest of us are completely calm about this situation

Howard
I think we should let him speak to the UN

General O’Neil
If anyone remembers anything from history class it is that
first encounters between civilizations don’t always go well

Unfortunately most of the time the lower civilization is wiped
out due to a war mass genocide or an intended viral outbreak
Think about Columbus and the Native Americans British Colonists
and the Tasmanians Cortez and the Aztecs the list goes on and
on This time however humanity is the lower civilization

Marlowe
Mr Benson we can’t leave anything to chance We need him
contained until we can confirm that he isn’t here to harm us

Howard sighs loudly General O’Neil turns and looks at Howard

Howard

Are you guys blind This is the biggest discovery in the history
of the human race Even if it was discovered that there is a
bloodline related to Jesus still walking around today it
wouldn’t reach the scale of the discovery that we are not alone

Marlowe
You’re acting like this is breaking news Trust us its not
We’ve known that we are not alone in the universe for more than
sixty years

Howard
Then why haven’t you released this information to the public

Marlowe points to the TV screen

Marlowe
We feared this would happen

Howard turns and looks at the TV screen On the TV screen a
helicopter shot of Klaatu’s ship appears on screen with GORT
still standing motion less in front of the ship

After a moment the image changes to a shot of a news reporter
standing some distance away from GORT The news reporter is
holding a microphone as she speaks

News Reporter

So far there has been no sign of movement coming from the large
robot however there has been an impressive showcase of military
vehicles coming here to surround the large ship and the robot
for the past hour or so

After another moment the image on the screen changes to a
helicopter shot of a highway jam packed bumper to bumper with

hundreds of cars moving at a slow pace The headline on the TV
says END OF THE WORLD

Marlowe turns and looks at Howard

Marlowe
People fear that our days are now numbered Its like Orson
Welles’ War of the Worlds on a global scale except this time
the aliens are real

Howard
But now the world knows the truth

General O’Neil
There were plans being arranged to have Reeves become what some
call a “disclosure president” I just never would have guessed
that the aliens would be the first to do it

They turn and look back at the large TV screen Howard looks
down at his wrist watch

Howard
I need to get home

General O’Neil turns to look at Howard

General O’Neil
Pardon me

Howard
I need to get home to my family They’re scared terrified
frightened by what’s happening and I don’t want to be away from
them for long

General O’Neil
Mr Benson you cannot leave until you have been cleared to
leave I’m sorry

Howard stares at General O’Neil getting agitated at the
general Suddenly someone’s cell phone begins to ring Marlowe
reaches into his pocket pulls out his phone and holds it up to
his ear

Marlowe
Hello YesI understandWe will be there shortly

Marlowe pulls the phone away and looks over at Howard and
General O’Neil

General O’Neil
What’s going on

Marlowe

Reeves wants Klaatu to be moved from here to a more secure
location so that he can be further questioned by officials
He’s asking for us to wait for him at the Pentagon Doctors are
on their way now

General O’Neil
Then lets go

Marlowe Howard and General O’Neil turn and walk out of the
communications room

Int Walter Reed Facility - underground examination room

Klaatu is still strapped to the bed but he is no longer hooked
up to the polygraph machine He is watching the door as it opens
and Marcus Brown (the NASA director) two doctors and two Secret
Service agents walk into the room

Brown and Klaatu stare at each other for a brief moment

Brown

Mr Klaatu we are going to be transferring you to a more
secure place so that you can be questioned by military and
government officials We will sedate you using the same non-
lethal temporary drugs that were used on you during the
operation to remove the bullet from your shoulder

Klaatu smiles slightly
Klaatu
Alright but I would like to be released soon I am being

confined here when I have done no wrong

Brown turns and whispers into one of the doctors’ ears Klaatu
watches them carefully

A circle of police cruisers and military vehicles still
surrounds GORT and the large ship in the open park

Focus on GORT who is still standing motionless in front of the
ship After a moment a low ringing sound seems to be coming from
GORT The robot however still does not move

Int Walter Reed Facility - underground examination room

Klaatu is still looking up at Brown as the two doctors walk over
to a table on the other side of the room and begin to full two
syringes with a liquid of some kind

Suddenly the low ringing sound is heard again Klaatu looks up
at the ceiling somewhat startled at the sound The strange
thing is no one else in the room is reacting to it almost as
if they don’t here it

After a moment the look on Klaatu’s face changes from startled
to sadness However as the doctors walk over to Klaatu’s
bed Klaatu looks at Brown with a stern apologetic look on his
face

Klaatu
Mr Brown

Brown
Yes

Klaatu
I’m sorry

Brown gives Klaatu a confused look but suddenly a look of shock
and pain spreads across Brown’s face He reaches up and tries to
cover his eyes He begins to scream as well before he collapses
to the floor

The doctors and the two secret service agents turn and look at
Klaatu who is looking back at them After a brief moment they
begin to scream in pain and they cover their eyes with their
hands as well before they all fall to the floor as well

The straps around Klaatu’s arms chest waist and legs suddenly
snap open and Klaatu sits up in the seat He looks down at the

doctors the service agents and Brown who are withering in pain
on the examination room floor

Klaatu stands up off of the bed and walks over to the secret
service agent laying next to the door Klaatu looks down at the
agent then cocks his head to the side a bit

Int Walter Reed facility - underground hallway

There are two soldiers standing on opposite sides of the door
leading into the observation room After a moment the door
slides open

Before the soldiers can turn their heads to look into the room
two hands emerge from the doorway and grab a hold of the
soldiers’ shoulders Suddenly a look of pain appears on the
faces of the soldiers and their skin begins to turn an icy white
color

The two soldiers collapse onto the ground and after a moment
Klaatu walks out of the room now wearing the black suit pants
work shoes and black tie belonging to the Secret Service agent
that was laying on the ground

Klaatu turns and begins to walk down the hallway
Int Pentagon - Press conference room

There are more reporters journalists and photographers than
there are seats in the conference room In the front of the room
is the President’s podium with the Pentagon seal hanging on the
blue curtain in the background

After a moment Pres Reeves VP Harvard and General O’Neil walk
into the room and General O’Neil and VP Harvard stand on either
side of the podium while Pres Reeves stands at the podium

The cameras continue to flash non-stop and there is a loud
murmuring going on throughout the crowd Pres Reeves raises his
hand for a moment then lowers it The commotion in the room
calms down

Pres Reeves
Ladies and gentlemen I understand that there are many questions
that you wanna ask and I’1ll get to those in a moment However
please let me explain all that we know about the current

situation At approximately 9 o’clock this morning a large ship
of extraterrestrial origin landed

Int Pentagon - office conference room - Early evening

Patterson Marlowe several Secret Service Agents and Howard are
sitting at a small oval shaped table They are watching Pres
Reeves’ speech on a large flat screen TV

Patterson
When Alexander comes back we need to discuss what we are gonna
do about the alien

Howard
What do you mean

Patterson
You know we need to interrogate the being We need to get him
to tell us what his agenda is

Howard sighs for a moment then closes his eyes A cell phone
starts ringing and Howard looks over at Patterson who has his
phone up to his ear

Patterson
Hello WHAT

Patterson’s eyes widen Everyone in the room turns and looks at
Patterson

Patterson (cont’d)
Well find him immediately Alright thank you

Patterson closes his phone then drops it on the table

Marlowe
What happened

Patterson
He’s escaped Five minutes ago Practically walked right out of
Walter Reed

Everyone’s mouths drop open

Marlowe
Are you kidding me

Patterson
I wish I was

Howard takes a deep breath as he turns and looks out the window
Suddenly another cell phone rings Howard looks away from the
window and reaches into his own pants pocket

He pulls out his cell phone and looks at the screen A look of
confusion briefly appears on his face but he then brings the
phone up to his ear

Howard
Hello

Unknown voice (over the phoneos)
Mr Benson

Howard
Yes

Unknown voice (over the phoneos)
This is Klaatu

An expressionless look is on Howard’s face He then begins to
appear stunned and shocked but he looks around at everyone else

in the room

Howard
What do you want

Klaatu (over the phoneos)
My mission here on Earth has changed I need your help

Howard
Hold on a second please

Howard stands up and begins walking towards the door Patterson
watches Howard walk away

Patterson
Where are you going

Howard looks at Patterson

Howard
It’s my wife Something’s bothering her I’1ll be a minute

Patterson nods his head but he continues to watch Howard as he
walks out of the conference room

Int Pentagon - office hallway - early evening

Howard walks into the empty silent hallway closing the
conference room door as well

Howard
How are you talking to me How did you get this number

Klaatu (over the phoneos)
Every phone number can be easily accessed with well I can
access them easily I’m using a phone booth located in a subway
station underground

Howard
How did you get out of Walter Reed Hospital

Klaatu (over the phoneos)
I had to do things to people that I am not proud of that I
would not have done in any other circumstance I apologize for
what I have done

Howard
Did you kill

Klaatu (over the phoneos)
I didn’t kill anyone Mr Benson I just I frightened them in
a way that may or may not scar them for the rest of their lives
which may not last for much longer

Howard
Why not

Klaatu (over the phoneos)
I will not state what has happened over the phone Only in
person Mr Benson

Howard
Where If you don’t already know I’m still in the Pentagon

Klaatu (over the phoneos)
You know where When you get the opportunity head home

Howard
Wait Don’t you

Klaatu (over the phoneos)
Goodbye Mr Benson I’11l see you soon

Suddenly there is a clicking sound Howard pulls the phone away
and looks at the screen A small panicked look is on his face
He closes the phone and puts it back into his pocket

Suddenly the door to the conference room opens and a SECRET
SERVICE AGENT walks into the hallway Howard turns and looks at
the agent

Secret Service Agent
Mr Benson are you ready to come back in

Silence for a moment

Howard
Yeah I just I wanna get a quick drink of water from the
small kitchen

Secret Service Agent
Be back here in one minute

Howard nods his head turns and begins to walk down the hallway
The Secret Service Agent watches Howard disappear around a
corner Focus on the agent watching the hallway corner for a
moment

Int Pentagon - underground parking garage

Inside the underground garage there are about two dozen cars
parked in their spaces Howard speed walks over to a black
colored Ford Mustang

He reaches into his pocket and pulls out the keys An unlocking
beeping sound is heard and the headlights on Howard’s car turn
on

Howard walks over to the driver’s side door and opens it up

Int Howard’s Mustang - underground parking lot

Howard slides into the driver’s seat and closes the door He
puts the keys into the ignition and turns the car’s engine on

Int Pentagon - underground parking garage

Howard’s black Mustang pulls out of it parking space and begins
to drive towards the exit ramp

Int Pentagon - office conference room - early evening

Patterson Marlowe and several other presidential advisors are

Suddenly the door opens and the Secret Service Agent walks into
the room and looks over at Patterson The Defense Secretary
turns and looks at the agent

Secret Service Agent
Mr Secretary Howard Benson can’t be found anywhere

Patterson
What

Secret Service Agent
His Ford Mustang was seen leaving our underground parking
garage

Patterson slams his fist down hard onto the table angry

Patterson
God damn it

Ext Bridge over river - Early evening

Howard’s ford mustang is driving rapidly across the bridge The
entire bridge is clear of all traffic except for Howard’s car

Watch Howard’s car for a moment
Ext Suburban street - Early evening

The entire neighborhood looks empty vacant Paper litters the
street sidewalks and front lawns of the houses

Howard’s car drives down the street for a moment before turning
into the driveway of the Benson’s house

Int Benson’s House - Front Hallway - Early evening
The front door opens and Howard stands in the doorway slightly
nervous to enter the house After a brief moment he steps into

his house and looks up and down the hallway

Howard
Hello

Howard turns and walks towards the living room
Int Benson’s house - living room - early evening
Howard walks into the living room and immediately notices Klaatu

sitting in the recliner chair next to the doorway leading to the
kitchen

Howard and Klaatu stare at each other for a brief moment then
laatu smiles and stands up out of the chair

Klaatu
Mr Benson

Howard
Please call me Howard

Klaatu extends his hand out in a friendly gesture Howard
nervously reaches over and shakes his hand After a moment they
both let go

Howard
What do you want

laatu
Something has changed concerning my mission here on Earth

Howard
What’s changed

laatu
I need to get back to my ship immediately

Howard
What’s changed How can I help you if you don’t tell me what’s
changed

Klaatu walks over to the front window and looks out at the
neighborhood suburban street

laatu

When I came I was instructed to give your species two choices
either end all forms of violence and hatred against each other
and your planet or face extermination However my leaders have
made the decision for you

Howard
What

laatu

At this moment a fleet of our star ships are heading towards
this planet and they are preparing to exterminate the human

race

Howard is so taken a back by this that he can’t speak for a
moment

Howard
You can’t do this

laatu

My leaders feel that your civilization is unable to change its
views towards each other and this planet’s environment Within
the next twelve hours my people will arrive on this planet
and your civilization has seen its last day Mr Benson

Howard
You didn’t even give us a chance

Klaatu begins walking back towards Howard a little firm is his
tone as he speaks

Klaatu

We have waited for a very long time to see if your planet would
change Unfortunately it has not Your people use lies and
hatred to hurt injure and kill others The amount of
discrimination we have seen geared towards other groups of
individuals is sickening The way your people have almost
complete disregard for the planet is frightening You cut down
entire forests and use little if any of the dead and destroyed
tree products Half of all of those products are burned anyway
You throw trash all over this Earth not even caring of the
repercussions it has on the environment Your nations are always
in a constant struggle to see who can be on top economically

politically and militarily Sometimes your own leaders have
disregard for its own people they only push for their own
personal agendas

Howard

For your information there are people who care Not everyone
hates or wants to hurt everyone else There are programs set up
to help those who have been victims of violence whether it be

because of their race gender age or background

Klaatu
We know and we honor those who do show sympathy and support for
others in dark times However Howard unfortunately a few

good individuals are not enough to save the entire human race

My leaders have decided that your civilization will not change

its ways and therefore you have been deemed a hostile society
in our galaxy and we cannot allow any of your Earth-based
violence to threaten the security of the other planets

Howard
Give us a chance to change You haven’t even given us a fucking
chance Klaatu Please

Klaatu gives Howard a sympathetic look

laatu
I’m sorry Mr Benson but there is nothing I can do

Howard
Are you sure

laatu

I’m sorry (pause) I need to get back to my ship before the
fleet arrives I need your help because my ship is heavily
guarded by your soldiers I may be an “alien” to you but I am
still only mortal I will not make it to my ship alone

Klaatu turns and walks towards the front hallway Howard watches
Klaatu for a brief moment then rushes over and grabs Klaatu on
the shoulder

Klaatu turns and looks at Howard

Howard
Is there any chance that I can get you to change your mind

Klaatu
How so

Howard
My father-in-law my wife’s father he was a professor at Yale
University for twenty years before he retired Throughout his
life even today he is a human rights advocate He has spoken
out publicly in support of civil rights for gays and Latinos
and Middle Easterners He is also an advocate for women’s rights
in Pakistan and the rights of the Tibetans He only taught
physics and advanced calculus at Yale but he is still one of
the most famous human rights supporters on this planet Maybe he
can get you to change your mind Please listen to him He’1l be
able to prove to you I’m sure of it that the human race is
worth saving Just listen

Klaatu and Howard stare at each other for a moment

Klaatu
I will listen to what he has to say But if I am to make any
personal decisions I will need to get back to my ship

Howard nods his head lets go of Klaatu’s shoulder turns and
walks back into the living room Klaatu turns around and looks
at Howard

Howard
He lives about an hour or so away Just let me just let me
grab a few things before we go

Klaatu
I suggest you hurry Howard There isn’t much time to spare in
these last few hours of the Earth

Howard looks back at Klaatu for a moment then walks into the

kitchen Klaatu turns and looks back out the front window at

the empty silent neighborhood street

Ext Deserted forest road - night

Through the forest tree branches the outline of a ford mustang
can be seen driving at a fast speed (but not ridiculously fast

speed) up the road

Focus on the car for a moment

Int Howard’s Mustang - Night

Howard is sitting in the driver’s seat Klaatu in the
passenger’s seat

After a moment Howard looks over at Klaatu then looks back at
the road

Howard
Can you tell me something

Klaatu looks at Howard

laatu
Of course What do you want to know

Howard
Um what is that thing that came out of the space ship
after you were shot

laatu
Gort

Howard
If that’s what you call it then yes Gort

laatu

He is Gort unit number 55760 He belongs to a system of robotic

intelligences that accompanies representatives like me to other

planets In some circumstances like the one that happened here
on Earth they can be used as defensive weapons

Howard
So I was right He attacked our forces to defend you

Klaatu
Correct That is after all their main purpose Gort activates
in the presence of violence That’s why I had to stop him back
at the park before he could do more damage

Howard nods his head as he continues to drive
Klaatu (cont’d)

Right now he is waiting to be re-activated either by me or by
aggressive actions caused by your military and your government

Howard quickly glances over at Klaatu then focuses back on the
road

Howard
Sounds wonderful

Both Klaatu and Howard share a brief chuckle

Klaatu
I guess it does

For a moment Klaatu seems to study Howard carefully by
looking him up and down

Klaatu (cont’d)
You asked a question Can I do the same to you

Howard
Sure

Klaatu
Back at the medical facility you said that your family had

undergone a tragedy over the past solar year What happened

Howard’s face becomes sadden and Klaatu notices

Howard
Um my wife was pregnant a year ago and there were
complications while she was in labor and the baby died before

it came out

Klaatu’s mouth opens up slightly Howard does his hardest to
fight back tears

Klaatu
I am deeply sorry Mr Benson

Howard

Our son who’s ten right now he was soo looking forward to
becoming a big brother Honestly I personally think that he was
the one who was hit the hardest with what happened You have no

idea what he went through after the stillbirth

Klaatu
No I haven’t I have never felt a tragedy like the one you
went through

Howard looks over at Klaatu and stares at him for a moment
before turning back to look at the road

Howard
You know Andrew has felt that we don’t care about what has
happened He actually thinks that my wife and I are trying to
forget it

Klaatu
Are you

Howard
No We think about it every day Every time we tell Andrew to
get ready for school we remember that we could have been doing
this to two kids not one Every night before I go to sleep I
think about how different our lives would have been if the baby
was still alive It’s just very difficult for us to deal
with

Klaatu looks down slightly upset at the news He then turns and
looks forward out of the front windshield

Klaatu
Every time an individual dies it is a sad moment But no one
truly dies After an individual moves on from his mortal life
he joins up with the Almighty Spirit in peace

Howard again quickly glances over at Klaatu

Howard
You believe in God

Klaatu

We believe in an Almighty Spirit He is the one who has mapped
out the destinies of the stars he is the one who rules in the
kingdom of love and paradise Your God is similar to our
Almighty Spirit Who knows maybe your God is our Almighty
Spirit Maybe one day when we enter the Spirits kingdom we
will see each other again and I can assure you you and your
family will see your lost child as well

Howard slightly smiles
Howard

That’s kinda weird Believing in the same heavenly being that
knows what lies in store for our civilization

Klaatu
Not so weird to me After all my civilization was just like
yours at one point We aren’t completely different Mr Benson

Howard nods his head slowly as he continues to drive the car up
the road

Ext Barnhardt’s house - Front lawn and driveway - Night

About 50 feet from the main road is the house which looks more
like a summer villa than a normal house Helen red nitro can be
seen parked in the driveway as well

After a moment the headlights of a car illuminate the mailbox
which has the words BARNHARDT labeled on it Howard’s black
mustang drives up the driveway and comes to a halt behind
Helen’s red nitro

Focus on front of house and driveway

The driver’s side door and the passenger door open and Howard
and Klaatu stand up out of the car They close the doors and
Howard notices that Klaatu is looking at the American flag
placed above Barnhardt’s door

Klaatu
It’s beautiful

Howard smiles

Howard
Yeah not many people think of it like that

Klaatu
It represents the bravery and courage of your nation

Howard
Uh huh

Howard walks over towards the front door with Klaatu following
him

Howard
Now let me do most of the talking They’re almost getting ready
to sit down for dinner I think

Klaatu
Understood

Howard walks up to the front door and knocks on it Klaatu and
Howard stand next to each other staring at the door Howard’s
eyes look over at Klaatu for a moment then they return to the
door

The door opens and Andrew stands in the doorway

Andrew
Dad

Howard
Andrew

He smiles immediately and runs into Howard’s arms They hug
tightly Klaatu watches them hug tightly He looks up just in
time to see Helen walking towards the door from what looks like
the kitchen She is looking at Klaatu and Howard

Andrew
I missed you Dad soo much

Howard
I know I know I love you soo much

Andrew
I love you too Dad I’m scared

Klaatu looks back down at Andrew After a moment Howard lets go
of his son and everyone walks into the house Klaatu and Helen
stare at each other’s eyes as he walks into the house

Int Barnhardt’s house - front hallway - night

Howard and Helen embrace in a tight hug Helen does her best not
to cry but a single tear escapes her eyes

Helen
I’m soo glad you’re here

Howard
I’m just happy you and Andrew are ok sweetheart

They pull away and briefly kiss each other on the lips After a
moment Helen looks at Klaatu curiously So does Andrew
Helen
Who’s this

Klaatu straightens up his posture as Howard looks over at
Klaatu

Howard
He is anhis name is

Klaatu extends his hand out towards Helen with a warm smiles on

his face

Klaatu
My name is Mr Carpenter

Helen smiles back and shakes Klaatu’s hand for a moment then
they pull away Klaatu turns and look at Andrew

Andrew
Are you from the government

Klaatu
Not exactly

Howard stares at Klaatu then puts his hand on Andrew’s
shoulder

Howard

Why don’t you go get ready for dinner I can smell it already

Andrew
Ok Dad Is Mr Carpenter gonna eat with us

Howard
Yes Now go help Grandpa ok

Andrew
Ok

Andrew walks down the front hallway and into the kitchen
Howard Helen and Klaatu watch Andrew disappear into the
kitchen

Helen turns and looks at Klaatu and Howard with a look on her
face saying that she isn’t buying this story
Helen (in a whisper)
Seriously who is this

Howard (in a whisper)
Can this wait ‘til after dinner

Helen (in a whisper)
No (to Klaatu) Exactly who are you

Klaatu
My name is Carpenter

Helen
Bullshit

(in a whisper)
Helen

Howard

Helen

Klaatu and Helen stare at each other for a moment
Klaatu
Do you really want to know

Helen
Yes

Klaatu smiles slightly
Klaatu
I am the being that emerged out of the ship

I am Klaatu

Helen stares at Klaatu in shock She takes a step backwards

looks over at Howard then back at Klaatu

Helen
Are you serious

Klaatu

In these circumstances yes I am serious

Helen
Howard

She

Howard walks over and grabs a hold of Helen’s arm

Howard
Sweetheart I want to explain everything later Just calm
down and relax

Helen
I am relaxed but you just brought an alien here the one
thing that is scaring Andrew and I

Howard
He’s not here to harm us ok I brought him here so that he and
your father could speak

Klaatu nods his head

Klaatu
Mrs Benson I come here in peace I’ve been invited here to
speak with your father Professor Barnhardt

Howard lets go of Helen’s arm Helen continues to stare at
Klaatu

Helen
Um we are just getting dinner ready Not much just
meatloaf (pause) Do you eat

Klaatu smiles brightly

Klaatu
I’m not that alien All forms of life need to eat in order to
survive A simple fact of life (pause) Please do not be afraid
I mean no harm to anyone

Howard looks back at Klaatu then back at his wife Helen nods
her head turns and walks into the kitchen Howard looks back
over at Klaatu

Howard
That could have gone worse

Klaatu
Again no human has ever had the chance to speak one on one
with an alien It would have been weirder if she was completely
calm

Howard starts to walk down the hallway

Howard
You coming

Klaatu
Of course

Klaatu walks down the hallway as well As he walks down the
hallway Klaatu looks at the pictures hanging up on the walls

Int Barnhardt’s House - kitchendining room - Night

The circular kitchen table is set up for four to sit A plate
with a medium sized meatloaf is sitting in the center of the
table with bowls of potatoes and green beans set up around the
table as well

Andrew is sitting at the table watching Helen move about the
kitchen Howard and Klaatu walk into the kitchen and look
around Helen walks towards the table with a glass of wine in
one hand and in the other a can of Dr Pepper

Howard
Where’s your father

Helen
He’s getting another chair for for Mr Carpenter

Helen sits down next to Andrew and hands him the can of pop
Howard walks over to the chair on the other side of Andrew and
sits down Klaatu watches everyone

Helen looks up at Klaatu for a moment a look of worry in her
eyes

Suddenly PROFESSOR SAMUEL BARNHARDT (early to mid 70’s) walks
into the kitchen holding a wooden chair with both of his hands
Barnhardt is wearing a blue velvet lounge robe

Howard stands up and takes the chair from Barnhardt

Barnhardt
Well then I hope we have enough chairs

As Howard sets the chair down next to the other empty seat
Barnhardt walks over to Klaatu and they shake hands

Barnhardt
You must be Mr Carpenter

Klaatu
Yes I am I’ve heard soo much about you and it is an honor to
finally met someone of your status

Barnhardt
Well I take that as a compliment

Barnhardt and Klaatu smile as they pulls their hands away
Howard sits back down next to Andrew while Klaatu and Barnhardt
sit down next to each other

Barnhardt
Mr Carpenter I hope that you have an appetite for meatloaf
(to Helen) I’m sorry for not making anything fancier
Helen

Dad it is fine I understand
Barnhardt
I just didn’t want to try and go out knowing that the stores

were probably over crowded

Barnhardt starts to chuckle as he looks around at Klaatu
Howard Andrew and Helen

on it

Klaatu swallows and looks at Helen

Klaatu
Very delicious Not like what I normally eat

Andrew looks over at Klaatu

Andrew
What do you eat normally Mr Carpenter

Howard looks at his son then at Klaatu

Klaatu
Well normally vegetables and fruits I usually don’t eat that
much meat

Andrew nods his head Barnhardt looks up at Klaatu as well

Barnhardt

Helen looks at her father then at Klaatu Klaatu turns and
faces Barnhardt

Klaatu
Well I don’t want to reveal much but

Howard
He’s an agent assigned to me He will keep me updated on what’s
going on with the spaceship

Barnhardt
Are you like Secret Service

Klaatu
No I’m not Howard’s bodyguard I’m just his assistant

Barnhardt nods his head before he continues eating Klaatu
watches Barnhardt eat then he turns and looks at Helen

Klaatu
Mrs Benson what is it that you do

Helen

Klaatu nods his head then looks at Andrew

Klaatu
And what about you Andrew

Andrew

Klaatu
Oh do the teachers give you lots of homework
Andrew

You should always listen to your teachers

Andrew
I do Not a lot of kids do but I do when I’m not sleeping

Helen

Andrew

Klaatu looks at Helen then stands up from the table Howard
Helen Andrew and Barnhardt look up at Klaatu

Howard

Klaatu
Yes I just need to use your restroom

Barnhardt
You can use the one upstairs Second door on the right

Klaatu
Thank you

Klaatu turns and walks out of the kitchen Helen watches him
walk away

Barnhardt
Very interesting man

Helen looks at her father for a moment

Int Barnhardt’s house —- 24 floor hallway - Night

Helen walks up the stairs and enters the 24 floor hallway She
walks down the hallway looking at the pictures that are on the
walls as well

Helen walks towards a room with a plague labeled STUDY nailed to
the door The door is slightly open and it sounds like someone
is in the room

Helen gently pushes the door open and looks inside
Int Barnhardt’s house - Barnhardt’s study - Night

laatu is standing in front of a large blackboard that is
covered with some kind of heavily complex mathematical equation

Helen watches Klaatu as he picks up the eraser and erases the
entire bottom line of the equation Helen walks further into the
room

Helen
I wouldn’t do that

Klaatu turns and looks at her

Helen (cont’d)
My father has been working on this for about a month

Klaatu
And it would take him weeks if not more at this current rate
to finish it I just wanna help

Klaatu turns and using a piece of chalk in his hands he begins
to write out more pieces of the equation on the blackboard
Helen watches him for a moment

Helen
Why are you here

Klaatu doesn’t look at Helen as he writes

Klaatu
What do you mean Mrs Benson

Helen
Why are you here on Earth

Klaatu
The fate of the human race depends on what happens over the next
few hours

Helen
Why

Klaatu puts down the chalk and looks at Helen
Klaatu

Unless I make it back to my ship and tell my leaders to call off
their plans the human race will be exterminated soon

Helen’s eyes widen in shock

Helen
I thought you said you weren’t here to harm us

Klaatu
I won’t harm you but I wasn’t speaking for the fleet that is
rapidly approaching this planet

Suddenly Helen and Klaatu turn to look at the doorway
Barnhardt is standing in the doorway looking at Klaatu and the
blackboard

After a moment Barnhardt walks over and stands next to Klaatu
Helen watches the two of them Howard walks into the study and
stands next to his wife

Helen
here’s Andrew

Howard
In the kids room

Barnhardt looks over the blackboard then at Klaatu Barnhardt
then picks up the piece of chalk and writes down several more
numbers and variables on the board

Barnhardt takes a step backwards looks at the board then at
Klaatu

Barnhardt
You did this

Klaatu
It was clumsy of me I know

Barnhardt
No No its not Mr Carpenter

Klaatu points to a fraction on the board

Klaatu
All you have to do now is substitute this fraction

Klaatu then points to the final line of the problem

Klaatu (cont’d)
into this part of the equation You should then have your
answer in no time

Barnhardt
I see That will reproduce the first altered term but what
about the effects of the other terms

Klaatu
Negligible With several small variations you had your answer
long ago

Barnhardt studies the board carefully

Barnhardt
How can you be so sure

Klaatu looks at Barnhardt who turns to look at Klaatu after a
moment of looking at the board

Klaatu
I find that it works well enough to get me from one planet to

Barnhardt stares at Klaatu his face full of awe and shock

Barnhardt looks at Helen and Howard then back at Klaatu

Barnhardt
Are you

Klaatu smiles

Klaatu
Yes My name is Klaatu
Barnhardt lets out a small gasp as he continues to stare at
Klaatu

Barnhardt
Helen Howard

Howard
Its true sir

Helen
Dad he really is who he says he is

Barnhardt walks over to a recliner chair but he doesn’t sit
down

Barnhardt
Please sit down Mr Klaatu

Klaatu
You sit I’m quite alright

Barnhardt slowly sits down not taking his eyes off of Klaatu

Barnhardt
So you really are an alien

Klaatu smiles

Klaatu
Yes Professor Barnhardt

Silence for a moment

Barnhardt
There are soo many questions that I have for you

Klaatu
I understand Professor But there is little time for small
talk I understand that you are more than just a physics
professor am I correct

Barnhardt
I don’t teach anymore but yes I still do more than just
teach I am a public advocate of human rights

Klaatu
I’ve been told that you speak out publicly for gay black
Latino women’s rights

Barnhardt
Yes not just here in America but all of the world as well

Klaatu
I am very interested in your experiences

Barnhardt looks over at Helen and Howard then back at Klaatu

Helen
(to Klaatu) He loves to tell people these stories

Barnhardt
I feel that if I tell these stories it’1ll wake people up to
what is happening all over the world

Klaatu nods his head Barnhardt slightly smiles

Barnhardt
I am very interested in well my first question is why
have you come here

Klaatu

Up until several hours ago my mission was to speak to the
representatives of every nation on Earth and offer the human
race one of two paths to follow Either put an immediate end to
all violence and hatred or face extinction

Barnhardt takes a deep breath

Barnhardt
Why would an alien race be soo interested in what goes on here
on Earth

Klaatu

We feared that if you do not put an immediate end to your
violence you will soon threaten the other planets in our
galactic community and we cannot tolerate that So several
hours ago I was informed by the transmitter placed inside of
Gort that my leaders have made the decision for you

Barnhardt
What’s going to happen

Klaatu
The extermination of the human race will commence in less than
four hours

Barnhardt’s eyes widen at the news

Barnhardt
Why Why not offer us these chances

Klaatu

Apparently my leaders feel that no matter what your
civilization has soo much hatred towards each other that it
would be impossible to reverse The way you treat the planet
is very similar to the way you treat each other

Barnhardt
Yes I understand but you are making it seem as if everyone
hates everyone else I do not hate anyone I speak out against
hate There are hundreds thousands like me advocates

Klaatu
I know that But there are six billion people on this planet
Several thousand good people are not enough to save the species
Your civilization unfortunately lacks the will to change its
ways but you do have the ability

Barnhardt
Then help us change

Klaatu
This is entirely up to the human race

Barnhardt leans forward in the recliner

Barnhardt
Every civilization reaches a crisis point at some period of
time It is here that we think back on how we treat each other
and the environment

Klaatu

The same happened with our civilization In fact we were very
much like your species at one point We were on the verge of
destroying our planet due to the endless wars we were waging

against each other

Barnhardt
So we aren’t so different

Klaatu

We realized how pointless it was that we were fighting because
of the fact that we were different Every individual is
different We realized that differences in opinions and ideas
help make a civilization thrive

Barnhardt

Exactly that’s where we are at at the current moment Yes I
understand that not everyone will change and you have to
understand that as well but you said that we have the capacity
to change we just lack the will You know what we need in order
to change

Helen walks over and stands behind her father’s chair

Helen
A global crisis

Klaatu looks up at Helen

Helen
When we are pushed to the edge that’s when we fight for change

Barnhardt

And you know what else I personally feel that your very arrival
on this planet has sparked that change Millions of people all
over the world are now laying down their weapons letting their

war prisoners go embracing each other Your arrival sparked
this change Maybe in a way that’s all that you needed to do
in order for us to put an end to violence

Helen
Exactly I saw on the TV that Middle Eastern nations are now
writing up peace deals with each other

Howard
You just need to give us some time Please that’s all we ask
Just give us some time to change Its already happening and
now you are threatening to wipe away all that has happened

Klaatu looks at everyone for a moment then turns and looks out
the window

Klaatu
Maybe you are right Maybe your civilization as violent
naturally as it is all it needed to change was a spark I’m
that spark

Barnhardt
Yes you are

Helen looks at Klaatu with a sad look in her face

Helen
Please give us a chance You know we can change you just didn’t
give us time

Klaatu turns and looks at Howard

Klaatu
I need to get back to my ship and call off what is coming You
are right I see that you have the capacity and the desire to
change

Helen Howard and Barnhardt smile

by this

Barnhardt walks out of the study leaving Klaatu and Helen to
look at Andrew

Helen
Are you ok Andy

Andrew
No I’m not

Helen lowers herself to Andrew’s level and wipes away a tear
from his face

Helen
What’s wrong sweetheart

Andrew
You don’t remember do you
Helen

More tears begin to run down Andrew’s face Helen places her
hand on his cheek Suddenly Andrew pushes Helen away Klaatu
takes a step towards Andrew and Helen

Helen

Helen

Andrew what are you talking about

Andrew

Just as Andrew begins to fully cry Helen wraps her arms around
him and holds Andrew tightly against her body Andrew buries his
face into her shoulder and continues to cry Helen fights back
her own tears

Helen
I know it’s not fair baby

Andrew
Why Why did he have to die
Helen
I don’t know but please don’t blame your father and I We are

as upset about it as you

Andrew
I don’t blame you I just I miss him

Helen
I know

Helen pulls away so she can look Andrew in the eyes

Helen

I don’t want you to ever think that your father and I have
forgotten It’s very hard for us to bear especially me We lost
a second child and you lost a little brother we know We don’t

love you less because of this alright We love you soo much

Helen and Andrew stare at each other for a moment trying to end
their streams of tears

Andrew
I love you Mom

Helen
I love you too

Helen places her hand on his cheek and gently lovingly rubs it
She does this for a moment

Andrew
I’m sorry

Helen
Its ok

They once again hold each other tightly not wanting to let go
Klaatu continues to watch them a look of sympathy in his own
eyes

After a brief moment Howard and Barnhardt enter the room and
look down at Helen and Andrew Klaatu takes a few more steps
towards Helen and Andrew

Klaatu
Tragedies bring people together It is at these moments that the
true human spirit emerges from the heart

Helen looks up at Klaatu

Klaatu
If we don’t hurry soon an even bigger tragedy will take place
one from which no one will survive

Helen and Klaatu continue to look at each other
Int Underground bunker - operations room

Inside this other underground bunker room is a long rectangular
shaped table and several big flat screen TV hanging on the wall
Pres Reeves Patterson General O’Neil and several Secret

Service agents are sitting at the table looking at the screens

One of the screens shows a thermal image of GORT and the
spaceship both of which are glowing bright blue another screen
is showing another camera angle normal view of GORT and the
third is showing nothing but static

Pres Reeves
General I want this operation to run smoothly and effectively
We may only have one shot at destroying the ship and the large
automaton

General O’Neil

Yes Mr President We are going to use the new F-22 Raptors
the Stealth Bomber and other pieces of high tech equipment
which are now being set up around the ship and robot After this
assault it should rather easy to track down Klaatu and bring
him back into custody

Suddenly the steel door opens and a PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR steps
into the room Everyone turns and looks at the advisor

Presidential Advisor
Mr President we’ve just received news from NASA

Pres Reeves
What exactly

The Presidential Advisor walks over to the third flat screen and
presses a button on its side

Suddenly a satellite image appears on screen showing the curve
of the Earth and what looks like dozens a brightly glowing oval
shaped objects entering the planet’s atmosphere

Pres Reeves stares at the screen in confusion

Pres Reeves
What are those

Presidential Advisor
NASA believes that they are more spaceships just like the one
that landed in Washington this morning

General O’Neil turns and looks at Pres Reeves

General O’Neil
Mr President that so called representative is responsible for
this Klaatu was nothing but the vanguard of an invading enemy
force (pause) He was preparing us for an invasion

Pres Reeves
We need to begin operations immediately Prepare our missile
defense system in case more ships begin to head towards our
capital

General O’Neil
Yes sir

Focus on Pres Reeves for a moment as he watches the TV
screens

Focus on the image of the other ships beginning to enter the
Earth’s atmosphere Maybe this is the end of the human race

holding his phone to his ear

Helen

Howard
No

Howard pulls the phone away and puts it in his pocket

Howard (cont’d)
Damn it The only other thing I could do is drive all the way
back

Helen
Sweetie if the TV is correct then they’re gonna be bombing the
Washington area to destroy the ship

Klaatu
Gort cannot be allowed to activate

Helen
Why not

Klaatu
If he does activate he will destroy everything he sees Once
activated only I can stop him

Howard opens up the front door and looks outside The wind has
begun to pick up a bit from before

Howard
Helen you drive Klaatu back to his ship I’1l go back to the
Pentagon and try to get a hold of somebody

Helen
Are you sure sweetheart

Howard
Yes

Howard turns and looks at Helen They embrace in a tight hug and
they kiss each other on the lips for a moment
After they pull apart Howard turns and walks out the door

Howard
I’11l call you if anything changes

Helen
Same here

Helen turns and looks at Klaatu

Helen
Go outside and wait by my car It’s the red one

Klaatu
Understood

Klaatu walks past Helen and out of the house Barnhardt and
Andrew come walking down the stairs there are still tears in
Andrew’s eyes

Andrew

Helen
You’re gonna stay here with Grandpa ok We’ll be back ina
little while

Andrew rushes over and wraps his arms around Helen’s waist
Helen holds onto Andrew as well

Helen

Helen reaches down and kisses Andrew on the forehead Helen lets

go of Andrew and he lets go of her She looks up and at her
father

Barnhardt
Help him no matter what

Helen
I know Dad Thank you soo much and I’m sorry

humvees and tanks begin to back up from their positions

The soldiers aim their rifles at the ship and GORT Soldiers
with the shoulder mounted missile launchers do the same

Ext Airspace above Washington DC - Night

Ext Large open park - Night

A loud engine-like sound erupts from the ship The ship suddenly
begins to glow a bright red color The soldiers stare in awe at
the ship and GORT

The thin red visor re-appears on GORT’s face He turns and looks
up into the sky in the direction of the fighter jets

Voice over radio (os)
He’s activating Repeat the automaton is activating

One of the soldiers turns around just in time to see the
fighter jets flying in low the lead jet firing a missile
towards GORT

A red laser beam fires out of the visor at the missile The
missile explodes in mid-air

The other jets fly over GORT and the ship GORT turns around and
watches the jets fly away He fires another red laser beam at
one of the jets The jet explodes in mid air and flaming pieces
fall out of the sky

Voice over radio (os)
Fire Fire at will

Suddenly every single humvee and tank begins to fire their
rounds and shells at GORT and the ship A non-stop roar of
machine gun fire coming from the humvees and the soldiers
combined with a constant rhythm of thuds coming from the tanks

Smoke and fire erupts all around the ship and GORT Trees catch
fire and explosions erupt as well Standing in the middle of the
smoke seemingly unscathed by the battle GORT still stands
strong

GORT turns his head down and fires a red laser beam at a nearby
tank causing it to explode The red laser beam slices across
the park causing humvees police cruisers and tanks to explode
into flames and smoke

The roar of the battle continues GORT turns around and fires
the red laser beam again at another group of humvees causing
them to explode Huge fireballs rise up high into the air This
is a huge epic battle for the survival of the human race

Ext Downtown Washington streets - Night

The streets are deserted barren Pieces of paper and briefcases
litter the streets and sidewalks In the distance the flashing
of lights and the sounds of machine gun fire and explosions can

be heard

Suddenly Helen’s red nitro zooms down the street moving
incredibly fast towards the battlefield

Int Helen’s Red Nitro - Night

Helen is focusing on the street in front of her trying not to
lose control of the car Klaatu holds onto the grip on the door

Klaatu
It’s begun

Helen
I know

Klaatu leans forward and looks up through the windshield He
suddenly begins to breathe slightly harder and faster

Klaatu
Hurry

Helen still driving leans forward and looks through the
windshield

Through windshield the other space ships glowing very
brightly begin to appear high in the sky above Washington DC
They may be several thousand feet above the ground There must
be at least of dozen of them

Helen’s mouth drops open as she sits back and continues to focus
on driving

Helen
Oh my God Is that them

Klaatu
Yes You must hurry

Helen
I’m going as fast as I can

Ext Street leading towards large open park - Night

The red nitro turns onto this other street which leads straight
towards the park the spaceship GORT and the battle Explosions
continue to erupt all around the park which is at least five
hundred feet away from the intersection

The Nitro stops in the middle of the intersection Focus on the
car

The wind has really begun to pick up with paper and leaves
blowing madly all over the street The sounds of the battle are
also much much louder

The driver’s side door open and Helen steps out staring in awe
and shock at what is happening five hundred feet down the road
Klaatu steps out of the car as well and looks down the street

Klaatu
He’s activated

Suddenly a jet flying low to the ground screeches overhead
firing a missile in the direction of the ship A massive
explosion ensues in the park A red laser beam emerges from the
smoke strikes the jet and the Raptor erupts into flames and
crashes into the office building halfway down the street

Klaatu rushes around the front of the car grabs Helen’s hand
and the two of them start running as fast as they possibly can
towards the park

Over head three more jet fly in formation towards the park
After a moment another massive fireball rises into the sky from
the park The red laser beam shoots into the sky and two of the
jets explode in mid-air

Klaatu and Helen continue running fiercely the sounds of
machine gun fire growing louder and louder along with the
sounds of explosions

Several missiles fly over head and slam into the ground about 50
feet away from Klaatu and Helen They both duck for cover behind
an abandoned news van just as small pieces of asphalt rain down

onto them

They are now about 200 or so feet from the park Klaatu peaks
around the corner of the van and looks down towards the park

Klaatu’s POV 200 feet away a group of soldiers emerge out of
the cloud of red smoke covering the large open park They don’t
make it more that fifty feet for the red laser beam shoots out
of the cloud and strikes them all All the soldiers explode into
ash and dust

Klaatu turns and looks at Helen who is crouching down with her
hands behind her head Klaatu reaches over and gently touches
her face

Helen looks up at Klaatu with tears smeared across her face
which is also covered in dirt and dust

Klaatu
Mrs Benson your father is right Only when we are on the brink
do we change All individuals have the capacity to do so They
only need someone or something to give them a push a spark

Helen watches with her mouth open as Klaatu stands up and walks
calmly and smoothly down the street Helen stands up and watches
Klaatu walk towards the thick cloud of smoke and flames that
encircle the park

Another jet flies over head and moments later a third massive
fireball erupts and rises into the air Klaatu looks up into the
sky at the small balls of light that are moving swiftly down
from outer space towards the Earth He continues on walking he
doesn’t even seem to be affected by the winds whirling around
the area

Another shot of Helen watching Klaatu a look of sadness and
hope on her face

When Klaatu is approximately 60 feet away from the park’s edge
he stops walking and looks at the cloud of smoke

Klaatu
Gort

After a moment the outline of GORT appears in the smoke his red
visor still glowing brightly After another moment he steps out
of the smoke and walks towards Klaatu

Klaatu looks up at GORT

Klaatu
Klaatu barada nikto

GORT looks down at Klaatu then he begins to reach down for his
master However GORT doesn’t pick up Klaatu instead he holds
his right hand out above Klaatu’s head with his hand completely
outstretched

Klaatu reaches up and with his hand touches GORT’s palm
Suddenly both Klaatu and GORT begin to glow brightly The
intensity of the light gets brighter and brighter until they
cannot been seen anymore

Helen covers her face with her arm as the light gets brighter
and brighter but then it suddenly vanishes Helen lowers her

arm and stares at where Klaatu and GORT where standing but they
are not there anymore

Smoke and patches of fire are all over the large open park
However the only thing that seems unaffected is the large ship
which is still hovering slightly above the ground

It changes from glowing red to glowing a greenish-blue color

image

into the room again

Presidential Advisor

going on I felt that this was the best way for me to
communicate with each and every one of you

Int Barnhardt’s house - living room - Night

on the screen

this planet very soon

Suddenly the entire theater screen goes to static Then not on
the TV but on the entire theater screen Klaatu appears
looking back at us at the movie audience almost as if he is
speaking directly to us

Klaatu

We have been studying this planet for many many years We were
saddened by the way you treat each other The way you act and
feel towards people of different cultures races identities and
beliefs is unthinkable on our planet We love and embrace each
other because we know that difference amongst our people is what
makes our civilization thrive Of course we are not perfect we
are not trying to be because true perfection is impossible Even
we have had our own deadly flaws In our dark past we were
approached with a catastrophic situation Just like your
scientists we called this “the tipping point” We realized
that if we continued our own violent and destructive ways
against each other and our planet we would face extinction
We tried to undo as much of the damage as possible but still
to this day there are parts of our planet that are permanently
destroyed and uninhabitable We knew that we couldn’t afford to
face the same situation again and if left unchecked we would
have destroyed our planet In order to keep peace on our planet
in an attempt to get rid of all weapons and all forms of
violence and hatred we created a race of robots similar to the
one that accompanied me on this journey Their function is
similar to that of your police forces They activate in the
presence of violence and automatically act against the
aggressor The penalty for provoking their action is too
terrible to risk The result is now we live in peace without
arms or armies secure in the knowledge that we are free from
aggression war hate free to pursue more profitable
enterprises I came here to give you these facts If you
threaten to extend your violence to outer space this Earth of
yours will be reduced to a burned out carcass of a once
populated planet I come here to offer you a choice a simple
choice Join us and live in peace or continue to pursue your
present ways and face extinction We do not have to be the ones

to commit this horrific act you are fully capable of destroying
yourselves We are not asking you to give up any of your
liberties or your rights The choice is yours and soon I
will be returning to this planet and I await your decision
