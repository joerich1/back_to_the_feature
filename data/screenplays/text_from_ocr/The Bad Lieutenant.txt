DAY ONE
GAME THREE LT WINS

EARLY MORNING — LTS HOME — QUEENS

This typical QUEENS HOUSE is sandwiched between other
neighboring nearly identical HOUSES

The MORNING SOUNDS Of FAMILY BICKERING LAWN MOWERS
and SHOUTED GOOD-BYES are heard coming from many HOUSES
on this close-knit block A NEW BABY can be heard BAWLING inside
LTS HOUSE

LT hurried and harried stumbles out his FRONT DOOR He heads
for his CAR parked askew in the DRIVEWAY

LT is some 40 years old His natural swagger makes up for his lack of
conventional good looks He is obviously hung-over

LT squints pained by the SUN He fumbles with his SHADES puts
them on

LTs TWIN EIGHT YEAR-OLD SONS trundle out the FRONT DOOR of
the HOUSE bickering as they run to catch up with their Daddy The
hefty TWINS wear ill-fitting PAROCHIAL SCHOOL UNIFORMS Their
oversize PAROCHIAL SCHOOL BRIEFCASES threaten to trip them
up

LTs WIFE BABE in arms comes out to watch LTS lovely SEVEN
YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER head off toward her school on foot Many
other members of LTs EXTENDED FAMILY hang out on the STOOP
and the LAWN

As the TWINS cross the LAW the bickering turns physical They
start whacking each other with the BRIEFCASES

The TWINS pile into LTS CAR
CUT TO

INT MORNING —- LTS CAR — EN ROUTE TO AT PAROCHIAL
SCHOOL

The CAR is obviously LTS home away from home FOOD DEBRIS
BEER CANS VODKA BOTTLES and other garbage litter the interior
An impressive HAND-GUN is visible between the seats

An old ICON of MOTHER MARY rides on the DASHBOARD

As the TWINS get in LT tries to hide the GUN and the illicit detritus
To little avail The TWINS pay no mind to his machinations they have
evidently seen it all before

As LT drives the TWINS to SCHOOL the three play wild rough-house
The CAR swerves crazily
LT

How many times are you gonna miss the bus
Huh All the other kids can get up in the morning
but you guys wanna be driven around like the
fucking President Im your goddamn chauffeur

TWINS

moment taking on KIDS LT cuts oft the TWINS tirade

LT

Shit man - there s your fucking bus I oughtta
make you late Make the nuns whack the shit

LT and the TWINS banter back and forth poke each other and box
around The apparent hostility of their words is balanced by the
laughter and gung-ho play of the rough-housing
The TWINS yell cat-calls as they drive past a BLONDE PEDESTRIAN
LT joins in

ANGLE - Through the WINDSHIELD the PAROCHIAL SCHOOL
comes into view A CROWD of UNIFORMED KIDS is gathered

10 EXTINT LATE NIGHT — KOREAN DELI

LT approaches the market where he intends to buy the DIET COKES
A display of FRESH FRUITS and VEGETABLES extends onto the
Sidewalk

LT notices a SQUAD CAR parked in front of the MARKET LT picks
up his pace

Closer now LT sees a YOUNG UNIFORMED COP outside standing
with the KOREAN OWNER an elderly man who doesnt speak much
English The OWNER is agitated and out of breath He argues
fiercely with TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS

A SQUAD CAR is parked in front of the MARKET
LT gets an idea He takes command
LT
(tc Cop)
Whats going on
The UNIFORMED COP is a timid rookie

00P

Uh Lieutenant Sir - The owner says they stole
cash from the register He was chasing them
down the block when I caught up with them

The KOREAN OWNER is still agitated He tries to give his side of the
story mixing English and Korean At the same time —-

The TWO BLACK KIDS plead their case They try to drown out the
OWNER It all gets rather noisy

YOUNG BLACK KID
We didnt do nothing man
LT shouts in the YOUNG BLACK KIDS FACE Its shockingly loud

LT
Shut the fuck up
LT turns to the UNIFORMED COP
LT
(to Cop)

Go get me a Bud A High Boy And make sure its

(indicates the situation at hand)
T straighten this out
The UNIFORMED COP looks at LT for a moment then goes
LT is now alone with the KOREAN OWNER and the TWO YOUNG
BLACK KIDS

LT turns to the OWNER
LT
How much did they take

KOREAN OWNER
Five hundred dollars cash
The TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS continue protesting their innocence
YOUNG BLACK KID
We didnt -
LT whips out his GUN and shoots a deafening BLAST between the

TwO KIDS heads It almost takes off the left ear of one and the righ
ear of the other

The TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS are stunned Speechless

The YOUNG UNIFORMED COP rushes out of the MARKET GUN
raised in one hand BEER CAN in the other Hes relieved that a co
wasnt shot but the whole situation makes him uneasy

LT grabs the BEER points to the KOREAN OWNER

LT

(orders the Cop)
Take this guy down to the Precinct I need to talk
to him

The OWNER protests wildly in Korean as the flustered COP ushers
him into a waiting SQUAD CAR They drive off

Now LT is alone with the TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS
LT takes the KIDS inside at gunpoint
INT The store appears to be deserted
LT
Gimme the money Now

The TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS have regained some of their cool
They are still belligerent

INT

YOUNG BLACK KID
We told you man We didnt take no -

LT jams his GUN down the PANTS of one of the KIDS At the same
time he whips out his BADGE and thrusts it into the other KIDS
FACE

LT
Give me the fucking money assholes
They give LT the CASH The KIDS stand there
LT
What the fuck are ya standing there for Be gone
The KIDS stunned split

LT swaggers around the store GUN in hand drinking the BEER
assessing the inventory with a proprietary air He pretends to SHOOT
at various products Plays around

In the back aisle LT aims his GUN at a BIG BOX of TOILET PAPER
While he holds the TOILET PAPER at bay a THIRTEEN YEAR-OLD
KOREAN KID rises up fron behind it his hands up terrified

LT LAUGHS then puts the GUN away
LT

BOWTAY rolls over sprawls on the floor in an even sexier position
On her face an expression of utter bliss

LT abandons the BEER

LT

Brown Downtown There hasnt been any

ARIANE

Who said anything about the fucking street Ive

ARIANE helps LT with the thin TIN FOIL PIPE She burns the
SMACK on the TIN FOIL SHEET for him so that he can manage to
inhale the PLUME OF SMOKE in time

le gets a nice deep hit
-ARIANE gracefully takes a hit of her own
They are both very high already Beginning to NOD OUT

ARIANE goes back to the IMPLEMENTS and prepares another hit
This time she catches the SMOKE in a SHERRY GOBLET and LT
drinks it
LT is very high now A meditative hallucinatory state
ARIANE takes a DIET COKE and lies down on the BED
She slowly sips soda through a straw Her eyes are closed

Susses out the situation
Around him POLICE TECHNICIAN-TYPES are busy lifting
fingerprints and analyzing the CAR and WILLIE - to no apparent
avail

LT uses his Lieutenants’ privilege to enter the MURDER CAR anc
begin his own investigation
TIRE TRACKS are discovered nearby The OTHER COPS are
distracted

LT takes Iis shot He reaches for and finds the Kl of COCAINE under
the BACK SEAT LT slips it under his COAT and emerges from the
MURDER CAR

Outside the MURDER CAR LT makes to stand up In the act he -
DROPS the BAG of COKE

LT is stunned He cant believe the Kl is actually in the shitty gutter
water in plain view of the other COPS

The COPS spot the KILO of COKE Even those COPS that were far
away somehow know what has happened They quickly gather
round the MURDER CAR LT and the KL

The PLASTIC BAG filled with WHITE POWDER floats on the DEEP
PUDDLE

LT is silent wrath incarnate

DRINKING heavily

Present are the BET COP and several other FAMILIAR COPS from
previous scenes
Whats going on

SECONDCOP

LT bursts out swings into high gear

CUT TO

LATE NIGHT — CORRIDORS OF A CITY HOSPITAL — HUNTING
FOR THE NUN

The HOSPITAL is an inferno LT exploits his cop privileges shows
his BADGE to the GUARDS

He wants to get into the inner sanctum Beyond where even COPS
were allowed to go He wants to get to the NUN

A sexy NURSE stops him
NURSE
Can I help you
LT cant help but check her out and flirt
LT

Im in charge of the investigation Just checking
security

INT

NURSE

(Suspicious)

LT

Do you want those guys coming back For the
nun Or for you

The NURSE looks at him unsure then walks off down the
CORRIDOR
LT continues his hunt

He comes upon a DOOR that is plastered with QUARANTINE
SIGNS One too many perhaps LT senses the NUN is inside

He has to open the DOOR but hopes he wont get a blast of disease
in his face He CROSSES himself - wearing a smirk but
nonetheless Going on instinct LT opens the door a crack

Hes right Its the NUN He positions himself outside the DOOR
keeping it open a few inches He peeks inside without being seen

Security

CUT TO

LATE NIGHT — THE NUNS HOSPITAL EXAMINING ROOM

From just outside the door LT peep-toms on the NUN while she is
being examined He sees her stark naked laid out on a table her
legs spread wide apart

The DOCTORS NURSES COUNSELORS work on the NUN as if
thty are automatons They dont grasp either the humanity or the
trotitism of the scene LT does The image of The Alabaster Nun
turns him on no end Yet there is also a deeper pathos to the scene
And the NUN is spectacularly beautiful She doesnt speak Looks
Tike a Pieta

A DOCTOR in a WHITE-COAT reads the MEDICAL REPORT to a

FEMALE COP The FEMALE COP writes down the details on a hard-
backed pad As if its a parking ticket

INT

The moving contrast between the words and the image seems to be
apparent to LT — and the NUN — alone

DOCTOR

(to Female Cop)
They inserted a crucifix eleven centimeters into
her vaginal aperture breaking the hymen
membrane Then they pursued the same course
with their natural organs of sexual penetration
They used a sharp object probably a hunting
knife with a curved blade to carve a cross
between her shoulder blades entering the flesh
an average of nearly one centimeter throughout
the area of the wound They -

Finally as if she knew he was there all along the NUN looks up at
where LT is hiding and boldly meets his eyes

CUT TO
VERY LATE NIGHT — ARIANES APARTMENT

LT has been there for some time They are alone Theyve both been
DRINKING and COKING

LT is carrying on about the NUN As he speaks about various
Subjects his tone changes radically From contempt and cynicism to
profound reverence From decadence - to awe ARIANE too
manages to switch from one attitude to the other

LT
Have you ever seen a naked nun I tell you
man I went to school with the nuns Ive seen
hundreds since then and Ive never tven seen a
nuns bellybutton you understand But this nun
let me tell you What a beautiful lady
(snaps out of his awe)
And whered the Church get the 50 G in the first
place The fucking Church is the biggest scam
going You know whats the real killer It costs

8000 per kid for them to go to parochial school
Ive got three kids in there already with two on the
way Christ That fucking reward is my money
man But thats Church policy The Pope is the
worlds biggest bookie Makes people bet on

their own salvation Double or nothing on

Heaven You go to Hell - then go to Hell In the
beginning was the Word and the Word was
bullshit

ARIANE cant stop thinking about the rape

ARIANE

I cant get over what those guys did to her I just

cant
LT

Theyre alive arent they Come on man

Everyones making such a fucking fuss just
because shes a nun Just because she wears a
penguin suit the church puts up 50 G for the guys
who dared to rape her Do you think theyd put up
a dime if you got raped Of course not Or even
for your little sister The virgin Like shit they

would
ARIANE
Susies not a virgin anymore
LT

Shes fucking nine years old Jesus Christ
ARIANE suddenly starts up
ARIANE

they make her leave the convent
LT thinks for a moment

LT

Who knows Who knows what their policy is
(sudden dreamy reverence)

But Ill tell you man that nun She was

LT snaps out once again grabs the TELEPHONE He dials LITE
Hes not in LT leaves ARIANES NUMBER on LIMELITES BEEPER

LT stubs out his CIGARETTE on the back of his hand He does the
move with intensity and bravado
ARIANE responds by calmly doing the same But she does it entirely
impassively and rubs the CIGARETTE into her flesh longer than LT
did
ARIANE comes over to LT and starts kissing and licking his CHEST
She discovers -

ACROSS
ARIANE
Do you believe in God Do you believe that
Jesus Christ is the Son of God

LT hesitates
ARIANE kneels down in front of LT As if in prayer
She starts giving him head

Before he can answer The Question he is saved by the bell The

ARIANE does even as she gives him head Every time she speaks
She pulls away and it frustrates him This dialectic continues
throughout the scene

ARIANE

LT thinks about it even as ARIANE gets him hotter and hotter

LT
The Church is a fucking racket I know how they

ARIANE does something OC that causes LT sudden pain

LT cries out Snaps to attention Looks at ARIANE
ARIANE

ARIANE gives him head again LT is more excited now than before

of the DESECRATION but cant see much because hes blind drunk

The enormous graphically bloody CRUCIFIX confronts him
He collapses immediately into a PEW Sleeps
TIME PASSES
CUT TO
MORNING — CHURCHCONVENT

LT wakes up Ruckus all around him The COPS are there in force —
including some of the guys from the BAR the UPTOWN MURDER and
the HOSPITAL PARKING LOT They are privately checking out the
Scene of the Crime looking for leads that will give them an
advantage Everyone wants the TWO NUNS to talk The NUNS are
in acircle of interrogators At first LT cant even see them

The ELDERLY NUN was attacked but not raped They carved
crosses on her

In the background the questioning has already begun The
interrogators become increasingly frustrated It can be heard in their
voices They want the reward and - despite a certain constipated
respect in their attitude - the COPS are willing to browbeat the
NUNS to get it
LT silently bums a COFFEE off a COP and staggers into the ring

LT hangs back in the crowd staring at the YOUNG NUN as the COPS
interrogate both NUNS

COP 1

Cant you tell us anything Sisters Anything at
a
The ELDERLY NUN speaks up
ELDERLY NUN

They broke my glasses I didnt see anything but

I did hear them They were young And there

were two of them They spoke Spanish One of

them was named Julio
LT on the sidelines turns to an OLDER COP IT mutters his
commentary

LT

(to Older Cop)
Julio Great There are 20000 spies named
Julio
The ELDERLY NUN lowers her head Shamed
ELDERLY NUN
I would tell you more if I could I am so sorry
Officers

Now the COPS are magnetized by the YOUNG NUN She does not
appear to need GLASSES Evidently she could give the COPS what

they want
COP 2

What about you Sister Wont you tell us

anything
LT watches the YOUNG NUN as—
POV LT - The YOUNG NUN smiles a quiet intractable smile
COP 2 is screaming mad but tries to hide it
LT has observed their interaction Though he would have loved to
have heard some information from the YOUNG NUN her defiance
gives him even more pleasure

The MONSIGNOR comes forward to translate the NUNS stubborn
Silence He is possessed by a conventional sort of ambition - this is

INT

his big chance He woud like to be Cardinal some day but never WIN
be He enjoys the spcngrt as he pcn ficates

MONSIGNOR

Listen One nun is nearly 80 years old Im not
from this Church of course but I assume theyll
be getting her a new pair of glasses Apparently
shes legally blind without them The Sister who
suffered a rape is just 17 She arrived from
Ireland only a couple of months ago This -
event - is Just too much for them to take

The MONSIGNOR clears his threat- demonstratively takes a
w-Diicitous tone

MONSIGNOR

Listen The Church would like to know who did it
just as much as the NYPO These arrant
criminals broke the laws of man and the lawsof
God The Church wants nothing more than to see
them behind bars Thats why were offering the
50000 reward to whomever brings them in Im
sure our hero will be one of New Yorks Finest

The YOUNG NUN shoots the MONSIGNOR an offended Look

It appears for a moment as if the YOUNG NUN makes eye contact
with LT But he cant be sure

HARD CUT TO
AFTERNOON — THE CHURCHCONVENT

Th« interior of the CHURCHCONVENT is still desecrated In stark
contrast to the white Church (above Scene 22)

POLICE ROPES have cordoned off certain desecrated areas of the
CHURCH In other places MOPS and SLOPPY BUCKETS of SHIT-
WATER wait for someone to finish cleaning up
LT appears to be entirely alone in the CHURCH He is desperate for
Clues He searches for leads and perhaps fcr something else

CU — He lights a CANDLE gives a QUARTER —
Then LT hghts his CRACKPIPE ever the FLAME
Suddenly the NUN appears

LT hides watches as the NUN enters the CONFESSIONAL Once s-e
is ensconced mside LT stealthly approaches the CONFESSIONAL
and from right outside - a tantalizing proximity - he listens as she
confesses to the PRIEST (This is an elderly PRIEST with a striking
unusual voice Not the MONSIGNOR from the COPS interrogation of
the NUNS Scene 20)

NUN

Forgive me Father for I have sinned It has been
two days since my last confession Father my sin
is a terrible sin A sin of omission There was
another sin that happened at the same time and
in the same place but my sin I think was graver
till

PRIEST

Sister we all know what happened to you
yesterday morning I expected that you would
want to speak to me about it But you could have
come to my office Your being here in the
confessional implies that you Sister have done
something wrong You havent I assure you I
feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt
If you condemn yourself because you
experienced feelings of curiosity or even
pleasure you mustnt -

The NUN LAUGHS At first it sounds like crying But it is a strange
low laughter

NUN
Father f c-y it was so trivial So natural So -
‘crgettaoie No I have sinned And you must
sten f you are to prescribe an appropriate act of
contrition and to absolve me Father what would
you do if you had but one day in which to use
your arrrs to serve God

PRIEST
Its funry you knew But the first thing I think of is
kneacirc the bread that I help bake for the soup
kitchen Maybe thats because my the muscles in
y aT-s still hurt

NUN
I also thought of that bread Father And of that
night six days ago when the Mother Superior
died and I kept the cool damp cloth on her
forehead freshly moist Father what would you
do if you had but one day in which to use your
legs to serve God

PRIEST

I think of running for help and falling to my knees
in prayer
NUN

As I have prayed day and night since the
desecration of this church yesterday morning -
and my sin You see Father -

PRIEST

Yes Sister

NUN

Yesterday morning God gave me but one chance
to use something else to serve Him Not my arms
or my legs but something I used for the first time

for the last time and will never use again My

vagina
Outside the CONFESSIONAL LT reacts to the explicit word Shock
titilation - and fascination

NUN
Those boys those sad raging boys They came
to me as the needy do and like many of the
needy they were rude Like all the needy they
took And like all the needy they needed

(beat)
Father I knew them They learn in our school
And play m our schoolyard And they are good

boys
PRIEST

You knew them
(beat)

Who were they Sister Who are these boys
What are the names of these - good boys you
knew

Outside the CONFESSIONAL LT stiffens This could be the clue he
needs to solve the case

NUN

I could tell you their names now and I know youd
be bound by a sacred vow to keep my secret But
I cannot tell you their names For I too am
bound As I am bound now to confess my sins
So listen Father Listen

LT cant help but start up As if telepathicaliy the NUN knew he was
there and cned out to him Asked him to complete her mission

LT senses the confession is over As the PRIEST begins to speak
again LT snaps to and returns to his original hiding place near the
CANDLES

LT watches as the NUN exits the CONFESSIONAL KNEELS holds
her ROSARY BEADS and begins to whisper the ACT OF

altar kneeis As if waiting for him

LT staggers down the center aisle Hes carrying the CIGAR BOX
LT joins the NUN kneeling next to her at the altar
ANGLE-The CHALICE is still missing

They are all alone At the ALTAR before the CRUCIFIX LT confronts
the NUN face to face The NUN holds her ROSARY BEADS

and PAOLO No one knows anything LT stops people at random
getting really desperate He shows people the CHALICE asks them if
theyve seen it before No one has

LT plays both ADDICT and COP as it suits his needs By now he
looks more like a homeless man than anything else But none of his
play-acting or lethal threats get him anywhere

The GAME is everywhere and the Mets are still losing

Finally LT approaches a hustling STREET DEALER He cops The
STREET DEALER is wearing a WALKMAN so the deal goes down in
mime

Now LT speaks and wants to be heard

LT
Hey — Have you seen Paolo or Julio around
The STREET DEALER uses his WALKMAN and the resulting
deafness to excuse his total lack of response

LT starts MOUTHING WORDS silently at the STREET DEALER No
response Then he — silently- begins to shout
The STREET DEALER s aarmed that he seemingly cant hear at an
above the WALKMAN music He moves the WALKMAN away from
his ears but doesnt teke it off

STREET DEALER
What the fuck you want

LT

You know my Uncle used to wear a walkman an

the time The walkman looked just like yours

And you look something like my Uncle But one

day he was standing in a cuddle - the puddle

locked just like that one -
IT points to a PUDDLE m wnich the STREET DEALER is now
Standing

STREET DEALER

LT
And he got electrocuted

The STREET DEALER tries to consider what this crazy guy has just
told him but before the STREET DEALER can even react LT leans in
on him shows his GUN and then his BADGE

LT

Look - I dont know you and you dont know me
