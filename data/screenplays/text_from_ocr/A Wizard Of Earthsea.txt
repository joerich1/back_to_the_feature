A WIZARD OF EARTHSEA

PROLOGUE TO BE SPOKEN

PROLOGUE
If you sailed out into
the Open Sea with the
wind of magic in your
sails your boat might
come at last to the
istands that lie just
over the horizon
the archipelago of a
thousand isles called
EARTHSEA

ON THE SCREEN the smal boat Lookfar sailing on the open sea among
great waves A man and a woman are in the boat

PROLOGUE
Before you came to the
white city of Havnor at
the heart of all the isles
you might see the North
Reach close to the
frozen seas

ON THE SCREEN a glimpse of the towered city before the boat but the
camera is rising moving over the many islands northward to
black desolate islands at the top of the map Snow to the waters
edge A white bear roams spied on by HUNTERS in furs and skins

PROLOGUE
Far to the south youd
find the Raft People drifting
on the warm ocean currents
Earthsea 2

ON THE SCREEN seen from the air but close above we see great RAFTS
crowded with huts and gardens with flower-crowned golden-skinned
PEOPLE pulling ropes on vast lazy colored sails handling long
steering-oars that take a dozen people to manage CHILDREN diving
and swimming alongside as the rafts drift in company along the
warm currents near the Equator

PROLOGUE ©
In the East Reach there
was war and raiding between
the Inner Islands and the
Kargish Lands

ON THE SCREEN two forty-oared WAR GALLEYS manned by white-skinned
savage-looking seamen and warriors are attacking a SEAPORT

On land the dark-skinned DEFENDERS are winding back a huge
CATAPULT with its charge a bag full of rocks

The LONGSHIPS come sweeping in

The CATAPULT is released The rocks fly -- and land in the
sail of one of the attacking ships It capsizes hurling
the crew into the sea

The dark-skinned ISLANDERS CHEER

PROLOGUE
To the West there were DRAGONS

ON THE SCREEN the ISLAND OF PENDOR with its ruined seaport deserted
by men smoke curling from the blackened and dilapidated towers

A sudden ROAR A great chord of MUSIC --

DRAGONS spouting fire and smoke perform evolutions over the
stricken island

Beyond the island a distant view of the DRAGONS RUN strange
rocky islets aligned in a kind of corridor over which the
dragons dance against the setting sun

PROLOGUE
Among the thousand isles
was one called GONT

ON THE SCREEN we see boiling springs spouting geysers volcanoes
rising out of the sea and gigantic golden waterfalls thunder-
ing over cliffs while rainbows form the mist above (Iceland)

PROLOGUE
GONT was famous for its wizards

ON THE SCREEN a GOLDEN EAGLE appears circling in the sky
Earthsea 3

MAIN TITLE
A
WIZARD OF EARTHSEA
SCENE 1 THE GOLDEN EAGLE in the sky
He is watching something on the earth below We see his

seven-foot expanse of wing the upward curving primaries
spread out like fingers as he turns on the currents of air

2 CLOSE on his eye unwinking as he turns

3 EAGLE P0V looking down on the mountainous coast of the
ISLAND OF GONT AIRBORNE CAMERA is sinking rapidly

4 THE EAGLE descends in great sweeping circles

VILLAGE ON GONT

or

PEOPLE are milling about It seems to be the goal of a
pilgrimage TOWNSFOLK TRAVELLERS are mixing with the
LOCAL VILLAGERS

6 THE VILLAGE SMITHY

A CROWD surrounds the Smithy the BRONZE-SMITH and his
COTTAGE adjoining They SHOUT questions The Smith gestures
as he tells a marvelous tale to the PEOPLE around him The
NOISE OF THE CROWD drowns his words Some of the people are
picnicking There are a lot of GOATS about

7 A WOMAN in the CROWD looks up and sees --

8 THE EAGLE stooping on the CROWD -- And like a thunderbolt
he falis --

9 THE CROWD scatters Some wave arms and SHOUT to scare the
great bird

10 A HUNTER with a crossbow He winds the ratchet as quickly
as he can

Earthsea 4

THE EAGLE stoops on the SMITHS COTTAGE

A WISE WOMAN comes out of the cottage She sees the EAGLE
and the BOWMAN She runs and gives the man a push as he
pulls the trigger

THE EAGLE lands and turns into a MAN
THE BOLT hits the side of a barn and sticks fast in the planks

THE EAGLE-MAN is tall middle-aged wiry He is dressed in a
loose robe kilted at the knee He has silver rings on his
fingers and a silver chain around his neck his feet are bare
and like leather on the soles He carries an oak WIZARDS STAFF
of exactly his own height He advances towards the CROWD

(Note The people of the Inner Islands of the Archipelago are
dark-skinned with features like the Indians of Central or
South America)

THE CROWD backs away Only the SMITH and the WISE WOMAN hold
their ground Wizards were commoner then than now worse luck
The Wise Woman makes a peculiar sign in the air and bows to the
WIZARD

WISE WOMAN
Welcome Lord Ogion

OGION
How is the boy

THE BOY He is a rangy 13 or 14 He lies on a jow bed in the
dark hut motionless rigid staring straight ahead with an
expression of exhausted terror

OGION THE WISE WOMAN THE SMITH They look down at him

OGION
Are you his father

SMITH
His mother said so Lt

OGION (to Wise Woman)

WISE WOMAN

Lord Wizard In spells and charms

SMITH
Shes spoilt the boy with her potions
and mutterings hes never at the forge
when hes wanted Hell never be a
smith

WISE WOMAN
Shame on you brother-in-law He
saved the village He saved your
life He saved all our lives

OGION
Tell me

The SMITH tells the story He starts slowly and reluctantly
then the excitement and the danger take hold of him and the
wonder of their escape from violent death and in the end he
is fairly shouting IMAGES will accompany the SMITHS SAGA

SMITH
It was a raid Heathens from the
Kargis Lands They came in their
longboats leaping like leopards
Down there at the foot of the cliffs
they landed There On our sandy
beacheswhere the fat cattle stand
in the water They cut their throats
and drank cups of their blood Soon
we saw farms burning One -- two -- a
score of them A torch in the thatch
Our friends and neighbors running out
to be killed They tossed them back
into their burning houses In East
Port they manned the walls so the
heathens turned away they came up the
mountain here to Ten Alders to the
village They sang their songs They
were drunk with wine and blood We
sent the children and the old folks up
into the forests Each of us stood in
front of his hearth We were going to
die but we meant to take some of them
with us -- oe

WISE WOMAN
(interrupts)
That was when Duny came running and
pulled at your cloak brother That
was when he said ‘Father --

BOY
Father Listen to me I can doa
spell I can hide you all Im
sure I can Let me try

WISE WOMAN
Poor lamb He says that over and
over in his fever --

SMITH
(violent)
I know

WISE WOMAN
You know And what did you do when
your son said let me try to save you
Father

SMITH
I boxed his ears

OGION
Hard

SMITH

I was a bit wrought up I could
hear the Kargs talking in their
heathen tongue I could hear their
harness creak as they came up the
hill and the clink clink when
their spearpoints struck the rocks

OGION
What did the boy do

SMITH
He stood there and rubbed his ears
and then he went down the street to
the last house on the left there
the Tanners house He stopped
there I could see he was saying
words and making signs -- (The
Smith illustrates with grotesque
hand-wavings) And as I watched a
bank of mist came rolling down the
mountain like a wave and hid him
from sight

Earthsea 6
(19

Continued)

WISE WOMAN
He made it come it was a Spell of
Hiding --

SMITH
Call it what you like JI call ita
piece of luck

OGION
And the raiders

SMITH
Well Wizard you know what its like
up here on the mountain when the
clouds come down

OGION
(nods)

SMITH
One minute were here and the
raiders are coming at us there --
The next were all blundering
about shouting in this mist this
fog -- And its our village after
all we knew where we were And
they didnt

OGION
So you killed them

SMITH
Three of them With my hammer In
the mist And the Butcher got two
And the-old fellow at the mill he got
one They got the Tanner But they
were so muddied by us jumping on ‘em
out of the mist that they went all
directions some running up the hill
some down back towards their boats

OGION
What happened to the ones that went
uphill

WISE WOMAN
Voices voices in the mist lead-
ing them to the edge of the cliff --
And over they went screaming

OGION
And those that went downhill

SMITH
Found their boats burning And the
townsmen coming at them from one side
and our men from the mountain on the
other And they made a stand with
their backs to the sea

THE SMITHS SAGA in images They should not be too realistic
though sometimes the images shock The sequence should have a
shifting uneasy style about it and the point of view often
changes or blurs

The SOUND shifts too in perspective Sometimes it is bright
and clear sometimes only half volume sometimes certain sounds
(like the CLINK of harness as in Tam Lin) are very sharp and
clear while other sounds are muffied

The scenes itemized in this version of the Script are meant to
be indications for the STORY BOARD

The GALLEYS coming in

RAIDERS leaping out into the surf

CATTLE slaughtered

TORCHES hurled into thatches ricks of hay or straw
MEN killed

WOMEN raped

PEOPLE burning their houses

TOWNSMEN AND WOMEN on walls of EAST PORT watching
VILLAGERS at TEN ALDERS

RAIDERS coming up the mountain path

the WISE WOMAN awaits him She makes a sign a large ritual
gesture

WISE WOMAN

The nameless BOY wades across the icy chest-deep pool to where
OGION is waiting A group of PARENTS watch including the SMITH
(Note Oniy Ogion is on the farther shore the others are all

on the near side)

CLOSE THE SMITH glowers as he looks at last on his son

THE BOY reaches the rocky bank where OGION waits with arm out-
stretched

OGION clasps the boys arm and draws him close He whispers

OGION
Your name is GED

MUSICAL SEQUENCE GED AND OGION

Master and pupil walk over the mountain to RE ALBI a village
like a swallows nest hanging on the cliffs above the Port of

Gont and crowned with a little castle

NO MUSIC OGION leads looking about him seeing everything
missing nothing GED follows seeing nothing
Earthsea 13
(72-99 Continued)

We see what OGION sees a spiders web silver with dew a

forget his sulks

GED
Look A sparrowhawk Can you call

(gravely)

If I summon him he will come

GED
Do Master Please summon him

Ogion looks at the boy then at the HAWK He says some words
in the OLD SPEECH holding up his arm

OGION
Enn kalannow avahee

The Hawk hovering above He stoops

The Hawk lands on Ogions wrist As he beats his wings for
balance his fierce yellow eyes look into Ogions

CLOSE ON HAWK AND OGION They understand each other
Ged watches excited and envious

Ogion tosses the Hawk into the air It hovers above them

GED

Earthsea 17
(72-99 Continued)

Ged is impressed But Ogion goes on ahead just as before
pointing out another weed with his staff making silent inquiry

GED
(savagely)
Milkweed

MUSIC as they climb A cloud which has been lowering above them
begins to pour rain Ogion unhurriedly turns aside and takes
shelter under a dense shrub or thicket sitting down on the
ground as a man would sit down in an armchair in his own house
Ged looks at the uninviting shelter and halfheartedly gets half-
way under the branches standing up finally a suppressed ques-
tion bursts out

GED
Master Arent you going to stop the
rain

OGION

It isnt raining under here

GED
But -- with a spell I mean --
Any kind of sorcerer can do it

OGION
Do what

GED
(getting wet)
Make the raincloud move away

OGION
But its business is here not some-
where else
(A pause GED gives up
and crouches under the
thicket near Ogion glower-
ing)
Besides I like rain

Ged cynical rolls his eyes Rain MUSIC

The rain thins sun gleams across the mountainside Ogion
and Ged emerge take up the climbing trail again

GED
Master I want to learn the Art of
Magic -- The High Art When will

my apprenticeship begin

OGION
It has begun
Earthsea 18

(72-99 Continued)

MUSIC launches into main theme as they climb on

OGIONS HOME could hardly be simpler Standing apart from the
village of Re Albi it is a barn with broad eaves and deep
windows with heavy shutters to keep out the snow in winter It
is no better than a house at Ten Alders GED thinks OGIONs
GOATS come bounding and bleating down the mountainside to greet
them MUSIC ENDS Apparently its their home too

A GIRL appears OGION is polite but distant GED tares She
has slanting eyes and a careless air of authority And wonder-
ful straight black hair

GIRL
Welcome back Lord Mage I came to
look after your goats But of course
youd put a spell of milk-stay on them
hadnt you

OGION
(though civil makes
no reply)

GIRL
Is this the boy they tel about Who
drove the Kargish raiders off the cliff

OGION
(nods)

Without waiting for an answer she turns and goes

High up in the CASTLE OF RE ALBI TWO PEOPLE stand at a window
watching the scene below One is the LORD OF RE ALBI the
other his LADY a mature version of her daughter

OGION sees them He also sees GED staring after the GIRL

OGION
Her mother is an enchantress Shes
from the North where they use magic
differently

Ged is intrigued naturally

OSION
It may be that her mother sent her to
talk to us

THE ENCHANTRESS turns slowly away from the window

GED and OGION enter OGIONS HOUSE -- one big room with thick
walls small windows and alcoves for sleeping The GOATS
come in too there is a corner for them behind a partition

of hurdles Ogion goes to make a fire

OGION
Ged sorcery is not a game we play
for praise That girl and her mother
the powers they serve are not the
powers we serve

GED
What are those powers Master

OGION
The natural powers that are in the
earth and in the air above the
earth and in all waters We serve
them We do not master them By
knowledge of them we share their
being and their power

GED
And their true names

OGION
That is one part of knowledge But
you cant eat it Hungry
(Ged nods)
My house is yours Sparrowhawk

SERRET joins in chanting the words with him GEDs arms begin

to rise almost as if involuntarily forming one of the great
gestures of invocation His voice gets louder clearer Darkness
thickens around their candle The GOATS behind the partition
shuffle and are restless panicky Strange SOUNDS begin to be
heard ECHOES of the words GED reads

125 BOTH OF THEM CHANTING THE SPELL Serret is more conscious than
he that the SPELL is working -- he is being “worked by it

126 SOMETHING is materializing in the darkness

127 THE DOOR CRASHES OPEN OGION enters A GREAT WIND accompanied
by WAILING SOUNDS rushes by him out into the night

SERRET
(terrified and triumphant)
Ive been taking lessons from your
pupil Lord Ogion He does you
credit

OGION simply stands aside SHE goes Ogion shuts the door
puts down his bundle without speaking or looking at GED He
goes to the fire and lights it hangs the iron pot on the arm
to heat the water

128 GED confused indignant and ashamed

129 OGION talks without looking at GED while he begins to cut up some
spring carrots and onions

OGION
She hoped through you to find the
Ring of Erreth-Akbe and through the
power of the Ring to rule us all

GED
The Ring of Peace -- But that was
lost -- the songs say When the
dragon killed the hero in Atuan

OGION
(nods)
Lo The ring
was broken -- not lost

GED oo
Broken
Earthsea 24

OGION
One half was taken by Prince Thoreg
of Atuan The last of his descendants
were drowned at sea and the half-Ring
was lost with them

GED
And -- the other half

130 In answer there is a STUNNING BLAST OF SOUND MUSIC CHANTING
OF WOMENS VOICES DANCING A PAGAN RITUAL ’

INSIDE THE TEMPLE OF ATUAN IN THE KARGISH LANDS

CAMERA CLOSE on the broken half of the RING OF ERRETH AKBE
held by THE CHIEF PRIESTESS KOSSIL The half circle of silver
deeply engraved with RUNIC SYMBOLS hangs on a chain

THE SCENE OPENS UP SWIFTLY AND DRAMATICALLY

KOSSIL stands on a dais before an empty ancient cob-webbed
throne MANAN a vast EUNUCH stands opposing her an
EXECUTIONERS SWORD in his hands

A PROCESSION is filing into the Temple escorting an IMPORTANT
PERSON

PRIESTESSES dance and CRY OUT revolve CLASH CYMBALS
There are no men in the Tempie

131 ANOTHER VIEW shows that the Temple is old and half-ruined Nobody
cares for it or repairs it The elaborate CULT goes on year after
year but the tradition is all that keeps it going The Temple
is gradually sinking into dust jike Petra the rose-red city like
Shelleys Ozymandias while the PRIESTESSES dance and genuflect
in a ritual which they no longer think about

132 As if we were GED our CAMERA GOES FOREWARD inquisitively to see
THE PERSON whom all the noise is about
The Person is a solemn little girl about three years old She
wears a shift Bare feet

133 CLOSE ON the expressionless faces of the DANCERS and PRIESTESSES

134 CLOSE ON KOSSIL She believes A fanatic

Earthsea 25

CLOSE ON MANAN He is an unbeliever but he puts up a good
show (he hasnt much choice actually)

THE CHILD has been well rehearsed She mounts the steps of
the dais kneels before the empty throne and bends her neck
for the SWORD OF THE EXECUTIONER

MUSTC AND CHANTING STOP ALL MOTIONLESS

MANAN raises his sword on high THE PRIESTESSES CRY OUT --
sharp exultant

KOSSIL steps forward as prescribed in the Ceremony and swiftly
interposes the BROKEN RING OF ERRETH-AKBE between the CHILD and
the EXECUTIONERS SWORD

MANAN lowers the Sword

KOSSIL
OQ Nameless Ones
Behold the one reborn
Behold the nameless one
Take her as Your sacrifice
Take her as Your Priestess
Let all her life be Yours
As it has been a hundred’ times
before
Let her be eaten

CYMBAL CRASH GONG TRUMPET-WAIL the PRIESTESSES SHOUT

PRIESTESSES
Arha She is eaten
Arha She is eaten

THE CHILD TEMPLE BELL TOLLS its cracked note overhead

CLOSE ON the CHILDS FATHER AND MOTHER with their OTHER CHILDREN

Mother is CRYING

They look back across a desert river-bed to the slope where
the cluster of great crumbling dusty TEMPLES stand and at
the top of the siope tall black STANDING STONES against the
sky

The BELL TOLLING

The CHILDS MOTHER AND FATHER Ahead of them the way they are
going is DESERT -- high sagebrush country distant mountains

OGIONS HOUSE GED listens to OGION

OGION
Many men have crossed the seas and
deserts to the Tombs of Atuan to
steal the broken Ring But the Tombs
are guarded by Powers stronger than

OGION

Yes

(after a pause he

speaks quietly)
Ged you are not bound to me or to
my service You did not come to me
but I to you I can give you what
you need I think but the School of
Wizards on Roke Island can give you
what you want Your power is great
you must learn to use it You must
choose between Re Albi and Roke

148 GED kneels to him

GED
Master I will go to Roke

149 ROKE PORT AND TOWN

The entrance is narrow and rocky like Bonifacio in Corsica
Houses crown the cliffs and hang on their sides The PORT is
smal and busy asthe SHIP which brings GED (a smal TRADING
GALLEY with both sail and oars -- Ged will say later that he has
rowed in a galley) glides alongside the jetty throwing her
mooring rope ashore

150 Amid CHEERFUL AND RAUCOUS FAREWELLS from the SHIPS CREW among
whom he has worked his passage from GONT to ROKE GED stands
ready to go ashore a knapsack on his back a bundle under his
arm All that he has is in them He looks with interest and
warily at this first place other than Gont that he has ever
seen

151 The MAIN STREET OF ROKE is narrow and stepped as it climbs
tortuously and steeply up to the MARKET PLACE LADEN DONKEYS
and MULES HERDS OF SHEEP harried along by DOGS jostie the
PASSERS-BY and send them to the wall GED stares at something

152 TWO STUDENTS are coming down the street DISPUTING the text of a
book in the hands of one of them a familiar sight in a
University town not so familiar is that one of the students
is a man-sized FISH Nobody seems to mind

153 GED watching with professional interest

155

Earthsea 28

THE OTHER STUDENT turns into a CAT The FISH slips back into
manshape and then not to be outdone turns into a DOG Cat

runs away and Dog chases him Nobody takes the slightest notice
of these capers

GED emerges on the MARKET PLACE at the top of the town out in
the sunlight and looks about him

A HIGH GREEN MOUND faces HIM across the MARKET PLACE
FISHWIFE

(voice off)
Thats our Knoll youre looking at

GED looks around SHE is minding her STALL OF FISH She nods
to him between CRIES of ‘MACKEREL FRESH MACKEREL’

FISHWIFE
Roke Knoll Where the magics
strongest

GED

Im looking for the School

FISHWIFE
Use the eyes in the back of your head
Fish here Fresh Mackerel

GED turns around

In the other direction closing the MARKET SQUARE on two sides
is a huge grey building of stone In the high walls are very
few windows and no obvious doors The School of Roke is a
formidable place a castle or fortress of the Arts of Magic

GED looks The FISHWIFE looks at him
FISHWIFE
Fine fresh mackerel -- Want to be

a wizard do you

an undertone)

161 The FISHNIFE is totally unimpressed She picks up a coin

FISHWIFE

166 IN THE HIGH SHOOTH WALL there is a SMALL DOOR It seems to be
made of a smooth translucent substance such as horn There is
no knocker no bell no handle GED draws a deep breath BANGS
on the door

A small square-shaped elderly MAN opens it He waits
courteously for Ged to speak

Earthsea 30

GED shows his LETTER

GED
I bear a letter from the Mage
Ogion of Re Albi to the Archmage
Nemmerle at the School for Wizards
on Roke

The DOORKEEPER looks at him mildly
DOORKEEPER

This is the School I am the Door-
keeper Enter if you can

GED steps forward He seems to enter But he ends up outside
as before

He tries again Same result
The DOORKEEPER watching

GED makes a Spell of Opening (broad and exact hand motions eyes
fixed on the DOOR one WHISPERED WORD which we do not hear)

Nothing happens
He appeals to the DOORKEEPER
GED
(dour)
Will youv let me in
DOORKEEPER

GED thinks about this Then decides (He addresses the DOOR
not the Doorkeeper)
GED

Who -- could --
JASPER

It could be done With the proper
training But provincial magic can
be quite interesting -- will you show

In the background the roofs of the School and a grove of trees
that shimmer like silver aspen

JASPER leading the way up the knoll at the top turns and
addresses GED

JASPER works an ILLUSION SPELL making an elaborate and palatial
set of fountains like the fountains of Versailles spring up
and play on the hilltop he conducts them like an orchestra
conductor

GED watches
JASPER dismisses the whole illusion with a flick of the wrist

JASPER
Now you Vetch

VETCH makes a pass or two and then offers on a platter a
ROAST SUCKLING PIG with an apple in its mouth GED puts out
his finger to it and it pops like a soap-bubble -- gone

JASPER
Your turn Sparrowhawk

GED
I dont work illusions

JASPER
Why not

GED
(lofty quoting OGION)
Sorcery is not a game

JASPER
Well what can you do

He starts back in astonishment

CHANGING SPELL

The Spells of Iltusion are always quite obviously just that
perhaps one sees the grass of the hilltop just a bit through the
fountains -- the ROAST PIG tends to flicker in and out of exis-
tence A Changing Spell is abrupt dramatic and intensely vivid
GED vanishes above where he stood a great FALCON hovers opening
its hooked beak to SCREAM It is there for just an instant then
Ged stands there again his eyes on JASPER

better know what it was before you
changed it

You wont study with the Master
Patterner till youve been made

the Master Summoner I advise you
Ged to -listen very closely to the
old man in the tower

An ISOLATED TOWER on the wild and lonely North Coast of ROKE
Two TRAVELLERS cloaked with knapsacks approach it

INSIDE THE TOWER the MASTER NAMER sits on a high seat above
his STUDENTS adding name after name in crabbed runes to the
long LISTS OF NANES that hang down and curl around and below

nm a is thin and parchment-colored and like the List
imself

MASTER NAMER

(his voice is dry and crackles)
A mage can control only what he can name
Many a mage of great power has spent his
whole life to find out one lost or hidden
name And still the lists are not
finished Some names are known only to
dragons who are the oldest of us all
Some names can never be known And this
May be well For the equilibrium of the
world may be upset by the wickedness of
the powerful or by the folly of the wise

STUDENTS working and listening lists great illuminated
scrolls books bound in vellum and boards litter the desks
and tables
GED looks up at the MASTER NAMER
VETCH is all tied up in lists and piles of books
VETCH

In the folds of his cloak is a Tittle ANIMAL It is small and
sleek like a muskrat with a broad face big eyes dark fur
sharp white teeth It is an OTAK

GED
Hullo Youre an Otak

The OTAK sits up and washes its fur

GED
I know your name Otak Your true

The OTAK pauses looks up at him opens its mouth as if to
answer but makes no sound - and goes on washing

AT ROKE SCHOOL THERE IS A FESTIVAL

We enter the great Dining Hall with VETCH who has escaped at
last from the tyranny of the MASTER NAMER As a matter of
fact the NAMER is here too at the HIGH TABLE where the
MASTERS OF ROKE presided over by the ARCHMAGE are gathering
to greet important guests

Note There are ten Masters on Roke that is why being
wizards they say there are nine

They are The Archmage Chanter Herbal Windkey Hand Namer
Changer Patterner Summoner and the one you dont realise is
a Master until you are a Master -- the Doorkeeper The Door-
keeper would not sit at the High Table or if he did he would

the neck JASPER is conspicuous as one of these VETCH wears
one too Jaspers cloak fits beautifully hangs gracefully
Vetch cant get the collar straight GED is too junior yet

to be made a Sorcerer although he jis known already for a
brilliant student

Vetch joins his friends and is greeted uproariously

VETCH
I made it I got away from the Tower
Lucky he likes parties

He indicates the MASTER NAMER who has obviously made some
gastly pun to the MASTER HAND who deadpans it

GED
You wont have to go back

VETCH

Look My Sorcerers cloak It was in
my room waiting for me

VETCH
(to GED softly)
Sparrowhawk be a man and drop this
now

GED shakes his head He lifts the OTAK from his hood and puts
it on Vetchs shoulder The little animal crawls into Vetchs
hood

GED
--(to VETCH)
Keep Hoeg for me
(to JASPER)
What would you like me to do

JASPER
Summon a spirit from the Dead

The words cauSe a sensation One of the students runs to get
a Master Ged is calm

JASPER
Do you dare

GED
By my name I will

GED turns to face the KNOLL

GED
Whose spirit shall I call

JASPER
(his voice shakes) -
Anyone Nobody will come

GED
Il call a woman Queen Elfarran
who gave the Ring to ErrethAkbe

VETCH
She died a thousand years ago Maybe
there never was such a woman

GED
Do the Songs lie

He is in the stance of magic-working now he stretches out his
arms in a wide gesture and begins the Invocation

NATURAL SOUNDS MUSIC AND SILENCE are all employed in this scene

We have allowed 14 numbers for this elaborate and intricate
sequence cutting between GED and the other YOUNG MEN the
KNOLL and the APPARITIONS OF ELFARRAN and the SHADOW

The words GED speaks making the spell are in the beginning the
same words as the spell he began in OGIONs house (Sc 124)
Sometimes when he speaks the words in the Old Speech they are
strangely distorted or turn into CHORDS OF MUSIC Sometimes he
draws the runes of them in the air and the rune burns in the air
for a moment and then fades or a rune or sign leaps out in fire
as he speaks the word

When ELFARRAN does appear there is none of the insubstantial
shimmering quality of Illusion about her she is real she is

THE HILL SPLITS OPEN

THE ONLOOKERS are knocked flat GED falls to his knees His
arms are still open in the wide final gesture

GEDs face He sees --

IN THE RIVEN HILL-FACE in the space created between GEDs
widely-separated hands a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN stands her face
sorrowful and full of fear She looks straight at Ged though
she stands half turned away 1

GED
Elfarran I bid you speak
Where is the Ring you gave away

With a heartbroken cry Elfarran puts her hands to her face and
her figure suddenly shakes trembles dissolves into a BLINDING
WHITE LIGHT FROM BEHIND HER

Out of the LIGHT flaring from the riven hill springs a BLACK
SHAPELESS SHADOW There is a flash of awful claws as it leaps
but it keeps no shape andswells and shrinks horribly as it

fastens upon Ged clawing at his face as he struggles to tear
it away

The OTAK SCREAMS and leaps off VETCHs hood
The OTHER STUDENTS run away
JASPER lies face down on the ground

VETCH runs forward to his friend
A WIZARDS STAFF of white wood bars his way

It is the ARCHMAGE NEMMERLE who has appeared The old man is
speaking in the Old Speech quietly calmly with complete
authority

NEMMERLE
0 argo now sahm hedrune
Kahmey sul sun ah shapvas

As NEMMERLE speaks the blazing GAP in the hill closes The
SHADOW THING has disappeared

The rising moon glimmers on NEMMERLEs white cloak
GED Ties his arms wide his face and shirt black with blood

With the end of his STAFF the ARCHMAGE NEMMERLE touches GED on
the heart on the lips

Ged stirs and gasps groans He is alive but only just

All is quiet OTHERS of the NINE MASTERS are there standing
on the hillside near the ARCHMAGE quiet as standing stones in
the moonlight The DOORKEEPER comes to the Archmage and puts
a hand out to him as the old man leans heavily on his staff
exhausted

THE HERBAL ROOM

Candlelight and shadows

Earthsea 56

GED has been carried there and his terrible wounds are being

dressed by the MASTER HERBAL

VETCH who has helped to carry him watches his friend

The OTAK crouching on the bed licks GEDs motionless hand

On ROKE KNOLL in the MOONLIGHT the MASTER SUMMONER stays on

watch

JASPER shaken and humble watches with him

JASPER
It had no shape but it had claws
It had no face
(he shudders)
Was it trying to eat him It burned
him But it was cold What was it

MASTER SUMMONER
It has no name

JASPER
But -- why --

MASTER SUMMONER
He acted in spite and pride He

has great power and so the thing he called

into his world is a thing of power

JASPER
But its gone Isnt it

SUMMONER
(always calm remote)
No It is here

doing the will of darkness

THE HERBAL ROOM
Candles burning low

GED is blind and dumb in high fever The MASTER HERBAL renews
the charms whispering and tries to soothe the wounds with
Totion-wet linen and with delicate precise doctorly hand-
spells

THE COURT OF THE FOUNTAIN Just before dawn

ARCHMAGE NEMMERLE on a pallet on the grass near the fountain
He is dying peacefully fully conscious In restoring the
balance of the-world on Roke Knol he has used up his life

The NINE MASTERS attend him grave and serene

NEMMERLE
Does the boy live

MASTER HERBAL
Yes But very near death

NEMMERLE

Save him Ogion said
(with sudden energy)

You must save him He wil be the
greatest of us all He will talk
with dragons He will bring back
the Ring the Ring of Peace to
Havnor If the wind blow true

PATTERNER
If he dies now the evil he has loosed
may die with him

WINDKEY
If he lives that evil will grow as
his power grows

PATTERNER
Yet that evil was born here on Roke

HERBAL
If he lives must he be sent away

NEMMERLE
Guard him -- keep him -- teach him

Her Ring Queen Elfarran

ATUAN THE TEMPLE COMPOUND NIGHT

HALF OF THE RING polished bright hangs at the throat of the
girl ARHA She is fifteen now She is listening to TALES told
by one of the two Sub-High-Priestesses THAR a thin old
woman KOSSIL -- bulkier crueller avid of power though
outwardly respectful of young Arha the High Priestess --
listens with interjections
(323

Earthsea 60

Continued)

MANAN and DUBY the two eunuchs are playing a game with
sticks tossing a bundle of sticks in the air and catching

aS many as possible on the back of the hand They play in
the HALL just outside the ROOM where the Priestesses are It
is a STORMY cold night and the women in their patched black
gowns huddle at a tiny fire of sagebrush on the hearth which
smokes and flares up as gusts blow down the open chimney
almost drowning THARs voice

THAR
So the High Priest fought and fought
with that wizard ERRETH-AKBE And
for a long time he couldnt defeat
him because the wizard used the powers
of sorcery they have in the West So
the High Priest called on the ones we
serve the Old Powers and they made
a dragon come And the dragon was
stronger than that Erreth-Akbe and
his staff broke and his Ring of Power
broke and he died and the dragon ate
him All his power was gone when he
lost the Ring Your Ring

KOSSIL
So they used to come to try to steal
the Ring back Thieves Redskins
Trying to sneak into the very Tombs

ARHA-holds up the HALF RING on its chain and studies it in the
firelight

ARHA
What do the marks on it mean

KOSSIL
Heathen gibberish

ARHA
But wheres the other half

THAR
A traitor took it and it was lost

ARHA
But the wizards used to come to try
to steal back even half the Ring
Stupid Didnt they know nobody
is stronger than the Nameless Ones
What are they like

KOSSIL

ARHA
You said just now they were red

KOSSIL
Red or black they all died down

ARHA
I like the dark

ARHA IN THE LABYRINTH

A long underground passage lined with dressed stone Arha
carrying a tiny faint rushlight passes us her face is intent
The glimmer dies away leaving black dark

SPYHOLE outside the Temple on the desert hillside near the
wall around the Temple complex MANAN scrabbles about finds
the right stone lifts it aside calls down into the ground

MANAN
Arha Arha Are you there

ARHA in another part of the LABYRINTH with her rushlight She
comes out of a dim tunnel and barring the way ahead of her sees
a WALL OF STONES - about waist-high She knows instinctively
that to go further is to go too far

ARHA
(whispers)
The Wall The Dry Land

The WALL winds and vanishes up a vast hill CAMERA PANS ahead
of ARHA to show what she sees beyond the wall a dusty DESERT
and the shape of a DARK UNLIGHTED CITY in the valley

CLOSE ARHA looking listening
A WHISPER comes up from the CITY OF THE DEAD

A SIDE ROOM OFF THE LABYRINTH CORRIDOR

Faint light in a cone shape from the SPYHOLE above Nothing
to illuminate -- stones dust maybe a rats skull

MANANS VOICE
(through the spyhole)
Arha Are you there

Just outside the doorway in the corridor hardly visible ARHA
stands The light from the SPYHOLE vanishes as the stone GRATES
back into place A flick and dazzle of light as Arha uncovers
her rushlight and blows on it to revive it Shadowy she

passes by the doorway and is gone

329 THE NINE STANDING STONES ON THE HILL THE TOMBS OF ATUAN

ARHA appears among them coming up from underground we do not
quite see how She stoops to replace the TRAPDOOR

CLOSE ON ARHA
Although young she has the poise of great authority She moves
among the great black stones her black dress fluttering in the

wind She lays a hand on one of the stones as one greeting a
friend or stroking a horse

MANAN comes BLEATING and sees her He goes to her

MANAN and ARHA among the stones

MANAN

Old Clotthe-Milk sent me after you
ARHA

What for
MANAN

Youre to go look after the novices in --

ARHA
Thats her job not mine Im the High
Priestess I go into the Labyrinth when

MANAN
Dont get lost down there Little One

ARHA
I wont I cant Ive had a hundred
lives to learn it But if a thief

the grim Standing Stones of Atuan silent in the desert

335 VETCH now two years older (perhaps a beard) and a full
WIZARD with a WIZARDS STAFF his own height strides
eagerly through the CROWD towards the SCHOOL PEOPLE make
way for him without any special fuss but appreciating the fact
that hes a Wizard

336 AT THE DOOR HE RAPS THE MASTER DOORKEEPER opens it

THE IMMANENT GROVE the rather odd grove of trees that we have
seen at a distance is not always in the same place Tonight
it is right on the slope of the KNOLL
The TREES OF THE GROVE are glowing not illuminated but glow-
ing subtly from within each leaf and the trunks are like
columns of soft light

In the foreground STUDENTS watch from the walled gardens of
the SCHOOL

MUSIC accompanies the RITUAL throughout

CLOSE THE PRESENT ARCHMAGE GENSHER OF WAY

He is in his thirties big black with a black look A
greater contrast to NEMMERLE could not be imagined

ALL NINE MASTERS are present when a Wizard receives his Staff
That means al TEN MASTERS of course The DOORKEEPER manages
to be there without being noticeable

THE MASTER PATTERNER is in charge of the CEREMONY He is the
most weird fey-looking of the MASTERS
Earthsea 66

346 THE MASTER CHANTER directs the MUSIC and SINGING no choir
is visible however he mainly seems to be conducting the
TREES

347 GED follows the grave simple ceremony Each MASTER might
come by to touch him on forehead or hand He receives his
STAFF from the MASTER PATTERNER ‘It is carved yew the
toughest and springiest wood of all and is shod with bronze
It is exactly his height a moment of the ceremony is the
demonstration of that fact

348 CLOSE GED surrounded by the MASTERS Suddenly he is aware
that he is among wise teachers who love him and wish him well

GENSHER

wool such as fishermen wear Ged shrugs it on

THE DOOR OF ROKE SCHOOL FROM THE INSIDE

GED in his new cloak with HOEG the Otak and his STAFF a
knapsack on his back looks like a pilgrim ready for anything
The DOORKEEPER pauses at the DOOR carved with the Tree of Life
Hy Drasil --

DOORKEEPER
Five years ago you won entrance here
by saying your name Now you may win
your freedom from this place by saying

LOW TORNING in the NINETY ISLES

It is the same wall (Scene 326) that stopped ARHA in the Labyrinth
when she knew that she could only go so far and no farther

GED stands on the daylight side of the wall There are TWO
ROUGH STONES that project on each side to make a STILE

On the dark side of the wall is the VALLEY and THE CITY OF THE
DEAD IOETH is running down the slope of the hill already
some way away

side of life -- of the WALL

As it forms it holds out great shadowy arms and WHISPERS to
GED

CLOSE ON THE SHADOW -- glimpses of glaring eyes -- teeth --
talons -- a proper bogey more is suggested than is seen
But we -- and GED -- have seen it before It WHISPERS to GED

Quickly it rushes towards the boat and becomes big and menac-

GED fights his way ashore ALMOST NIGHT

ON THE SAND AN OBJECT GLIMMERS It is his STAFF shining with
dim WERELIGHT

GED stands with his STAFF shivering in the wind

A BEDRAGGLED OTAK SNEEZES in his hood pops out

GED

Hoeg
(he calls)
Ohe Ohe

IN A HOVEL among the dunes built of driftwood are two old
smal white-skinned people a MAN AND A WOMAN dressed in
rags of woven grass and birdskins The man is squatting by a
fire-pit the woman lies near him under a heap of rags

GED (off)
Anybody here

The old man and woman exchange terrified glances as they
hear his voice

Using his STAFF as a support GED has made his way up the dunes
and sees the faint firelight through the cracks in the HOVEL
TEETH CHATTERING he struggles towards it

THE OLD WOMAN peers out of the rickety door darts back
inside as she sees GED coming

IN THE HOVEL the OLD MAN AND WOMAN are QUARRELLING feebly The
door opens and GED enters He has to stoop

Earthsea 78

THE OLD MAN AND WOMAN are terrified

GED WHISPERS

GED
IT wont hurt you

He strips off his clothes his TEETH CHATTERING
The TWO OLD PEOPLE cower away from him

Naked GED puls a rag from the heap and dries himself The
OTAK pops up out of his discarded hood and licks its fur

GED
Have you got something

The little OLD WOMAN timidly indicates the heap of rags
feathers etc that was her bed GED burrows into it

He remembers his STAFF and pulls it beside him He looks once
more at the castaways

They stare at him

GED
Go to sleep poor
(he is asleep)

The OTAK sits by his head glaring fiercely at the old
couple

NEXT MORNING the sea is calm and we can see the SANDBAR for

that is all it is No trees sparse dune-grass The hut which
looks as if children playing had built it is in a saucer of the
dunes There is a shallow well Racks for drying fish and seal-
skins How would they kill seal -- are made of driftwood and
bird-bones Piles of shells big and little And all around

the empty sea

GED is still asleep but restless The OTAK washes his face

The little OLD MAN AND WOMAN sit looking at their unwelcome
guest There is a yearning look in the little Old Womans
eyes Seeing him move she dips up water for him from a
big shell into a little shell

GED sits up rather suddenly and wildly staring about him

THE WOMAN spills the water then CRIES and wipes her eyes with
her hair

GED
Do you speak Hardic - No --
Kargish

The OLD MAN nods then panics and blunders outside through the
open door

GED
(to Woman)
Please --

He hands her the shell she scoops up water and gives it to
him he drinks

She watches him stil with the same look in her eyes She
turns and scrambles out the door

OUTSIDE the OLD MAN is down the beach as far as he can get
from the hut The OLD WOMAN goes to a rockpool and scoops
a handful of mussels from a reserve

IN THE HUT GED is half dressed She returns and offers the
mussels He nods thanks and smiles -- we have scarcely seen
him smile before - and opens the mussels with his knife

Meanwhile she rummages in the ragheap and produces a bundle
With some timid childlike ceremony she opens it and holds up
for GED to see a childs silk brocade dress stiff with seed-
pearls yellow and stained with age and sea-water On the bodice
is worked in pearls a double arrow with a Kings Crown over all

there is a tremor in the walls about them

starts to work the bellows which are like a smiths bellows

staring at the fire He is still dressed in furs and cloth of
silver now stained with seawater and weather and torn by

the Back Door of the Labyrinth

GED IN THE LABYRINTH

He is coming down very steep narrow stone steps lit faintly

by a dim werelight glow from his STAFF At the foot of the

step he stops looking around alert and poised as a wild

animal The dark passages lead off in more than one direction
Shadows gather all around and move even though the light does
not move There is a queer threatening THRUMMING DRONE OF SOUND
almost subsonic The werelight flickers nearly fails Ged
revives it with a gesture but it remains weak He flicks a
slightly worried glance at it and then sets off resolutely down
one of the passages The faint light vanishes in the dark

soft VOICE

which lies a vast darkness in which his werelight picks out
faint gleams and sparkles

the far end

ARHA
(breathes)
Robbers

She comes forward cautiously feeling the wall with her hand
for guidance

ARHA comes to a stop in an angle of the passage From here
she can see into THE GREAT CAVE UNDER THE STANDING STONES --
a hollow hill The first glimpse is a dim immensity Then --

GED at the arched doorway some yards distant raises his STAFF

and the WERELIGHT brightens revealing the VAULTED CAVERN alive
with the flash and sparkle of crystals glittering with lovely

traceries and pinnacles and stalagmites of white limestone --

a glory of light Still mirror-pools reflect the light

CLOSE ON GED holding the bright staff aloft We see his scarred
face clearly

CLOSE ON ARHAs face wide-eyed illuminated by the glory
GED comes further into the CAVERN and takes the formal STANCE
of a SPELL OF SUMMONING
GED

Oh Nameless Ones By my own name

Ged I summon you
The WORDS ECHO around the walls and down the passages
A sort of VAST SIGH comes back to him

to stoop In the dimmest possible light

ARHA
(gasps to herself)
Cut off the Back Door -- Trap him --

GED following her lets the WERELIGHT glow stronger

ARHA wrestles with the IRON DOOR It closes with a CLANG
Sparks

Arha strikes a light with unsteady hands holds her rush-
light to check that the iron door is tight shut

ARHA
(vicious whispering)
You wont get that open with all
your magic

MANAN sits on the TRAPDOOR where ARHA left him BANGING on

MANAN AND ARHA

MANAN

Little Mistress --

Arha frowns shrugs him away She keeps watching this extra-
ordinary person

GED lets the WERELIGHT float up into the air above his head

as he pillows his head on his knapsack He lies back and gets
comfortable on the stones A silver chain with an amulet on it
very like ARHAs flashes as he moves He puts his hand over it
as if the touch reassured him

ARHA fingers the chain and amulet on her neck

Ged looks at her with genuine admiration he is impressed but
not frightened

GED
You do How

ARHA
You said it OQut loud In the --
In the cavern When the light made
it so beautiful

Her defiance and hatefulness are spent at speaking of the cavern

to touch the outside of her hand with the outside of his
She does not draw away but holds still gazing at him steadily

ARHA
Your name is GED

GED
Yes Your name is Tenar

ARHA -- henceforth TENAR «- is motionless hearing her true name
Her lips move soundlessly forming the name -- TENAR

There is a SOUND LIKE A SWELLING THUNDER ROLLING THROUGH THE
STONE PASSAGES AND ROOMS

TENAR STANDS

TENAR
Yes -- Tenar
(she shouts)
QO Nameless Ones My name is Tenar --
Tenar -- TENAR I am not your servant

A ROAR from the LABYRINTH in reply and a stirring of the stones
as the echoes return
TENAR holds out the half of the Ring she wears
TENAR

GED
Take it

He places it in her palm They exchange looks

The two halves lie on her palm The edges match

WIND is now HOWLING where no wind should blow the stones are
GRINDING and CLASHING the SOUNDS OF THE EARTHQUAKE are terrific
dust falls in streams from the roof cracks appear across the
painted figures on the walls GED and TENAR are totally
absorbed in their endeavor GED grips his STAFF in his left
hand and with his right covers the RING on TENARs palm

Urgently he SPEAKS the WORDS OF A SPELL

SWEAT breaks out on his forehead TENARs FACE intent almost
smiling

A HIGH WAILING SCREAMING dominates the EARTHQUAKE ‘NOISES
Their HANDS tremble GED moves his hand aside The RING
lies whole a circle on TENARs palm

GED slips it on TENARs thin arm which it fits on the wrist

A MIGHTY ROAR OR SOUND FROM THE LABYRINTH LIKE and FRUSTRATED
DRAGON

Swift and decisive Tenar unlocks Geds chains
She helps him stand up The whole room rocks and shakes They

turn to the door Tenar leading the way

behind TENAR and GED She leads the way their light is from
Geds STAFF STRANGE ROARING NOISES from the bowels of the
earth

THE PIT

They have come to a place where the tunnel widens out into a
kind of oval floorless cavern The only way past the PIT is
a narrow ledge one stones width that stretches for fifteen
or twenty feet along one side

TENAR
This is a bad bit

GED
Take the light

She takes his STAFF and goes forward careful but fearless

She reaches back her hand to him he takes it They have to
edge along bent forward because the roof of the PIT is low and
curving sliding their feet along sideways TENAR holds the
LIGHTED STAFF up and ahead of her as they go They are near
the end of this fearful passage when -- the STAFF is pulled
from Tenars hand

lunges forward --

Lashing out wildly with the STAFF Kossil overbalances and
falls into the pit The light of the STAFF flares brilliant

642 The dim figure of TENAR stands motionless behind GED on the
far side of the WALL -- the side of life

643 GED sees something

644 A DARK SHAPE reminiscent of the WATERSPOUT is approaching
swiftly out of the twilight It is condensing writhing
solidifying taking form as it seeks and pounces searches
then sees GED and is at once upon him

645 GED in the posture of SUMMONING confronts the SHADOW

646 THE SHADOW Bodies faces shifting changing melting into
one another

THE STANDING STONES are moving

They jerk and Jean like the masts of ships in a tideway One
seems to rear up Then with a shudder it falls Another falls
smashing the first Behind the Stones the great mass of the
Temple of the Throne domes and walls is collapsing The
earth ripples and buckles A huge crack opens in the Hill of
the Tombs The Stones still upright topple into it and are
swallowed With a great SCREAM the raw black lips of the crack
close a THUNDERCLAP the whole hill shakes violently and is
still Dust

GED AND TENAR cross the rise of the desert ridge and look
back at the ruined Tempie in the distance

A swirling murk of dust hanging over the ruined bujidings

Suddenly shy TENAR lets go of GEDs hand with the excuse of
looking at the RING on her wrist
