INT WORKSHOP - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Under the cold morning light a black fly on a rough cement
floor A small pool of blood slowly stretches toward the fly
which flies away

The pool flows to the face of a young man of Moroccan origin
NAOUFEL is lying on the ground groggy but conscious
with a black eye In front of him are his broken glasses
smeared with blood

He looks at an amputated hand A right hand clenched whose
closed fist relaxes a little It has a small mole wedged
between its index and middle finger This hand is ROSALIE

Naoufel and Rosalie seem to look at each other The fly lands
on the young mans cheek

Behind Naoufel a man whose face is not visible opens a
door A voice reaches him as if stifled

GEORGES
Naoufel

Impassive Naoufel gently turns his head towards the man who
rushes to rescue him

END FLASHBACK

INT RABAT HOUSE - DAY - 1975 (FLASHBACK)

Through the window a beautiful garden a small swing Tall
palm trees edge a sunny path Morocco A fly hits the window
trying to escape in vain Bzzzz Bzzzz

A childs hand approaches pointing a microphone toward the
fly Its Rosalie with her mole between index and middle
finger She is about 6 years old Naoufel attached to her
is 6 years old too

The fly ends up giving up and disappears
Naoufel stops the recording on the tape recorder he wears on
his shoulder before storing his microphone in a holster

attached to his cowboy belt

NAOUFEL
Daddy

His father SAJI sitting in an armchair at the other
end of the room glances at him over his newspaper The
Moroccan lounge is rich bourgeois

SAJI
Yes Naoufel
NAOUFEL
How do you catch a fly
SAJI
You have to aim at its side
NAOUFEL
(pf£f£) Come on
SAJI

You asked me I’m telling you
It’ll always be faster than you

The fly has just landed on the furniture under the window

SAJI (0S) (CONTD)
If you aim for it by the time you
get to it itll be gone Take it
by surprise Dont go for where it
is but for where it will be

Naoufel gets ready to trap the fly with Rosalie

SAJI (0S) (CONTD)
The trick is to wait until the fly
rubs its legs together And then
you take it by surprise

Rosalie pounces and misses the target

NAOUFEL (0S)
Pff that wont work the fly can
see everything with its giant eyes

SAJI (0S)
(laugh) That’s true But it cant
foresee you coming from the side
Come on try again

Rosalie tries again and again On a door on a partition on
an astronaut figurine Without success

The fly is now walking on a globe Rosalie’s shadow hovers
overhead

NAOUFEL (0S)
Pff your trick doesn’t work
SAJI (0S)
I never said it was easy You can’t
always win That’s life

The fly rubs its little legs together and flies away before
Rosalie can catch it

INT MEDICAL SCHOOL - NIGHT - PARIS

Black Boom boom Like someone is trying to open a door
The sound of glass utensils clashing with each hit Maybe an
animal Boom

Something suddenly escapes from a fridge trapped ina
plastic film Flasks and containers of all kinds break on the
tiled floor

In the fridge still open a jar full of eyes ready to be
dissected spills An eye flips into the void bouncing off
the floor like a ping-pong ball before rolling in front of
the small plastic bag that has fallen from the fridge
Rosalie inert is inside

A laboratory in medical school

Suddenly Rosalie is seized with a spasm that tightens
violently The five fingers clash against the plastic bag and
hit the eye which is projected towards a door open onto the
hallway

Rosalie pats on the right on the left she probes the
surroundings and pricks her finger on a piece of glass
Drip drip She uses the broken glass to cut the plastic and
is finally free

She crawls with difficulty toward the door but freezes In
the hallway a cleaner moves the polisher over the floor
Rosalie waits the man continues on his way The way is
clear

Rosalie stands up a little on her fingers Like a newly born
foal she awkwardly discovers her new center of gravity her
new autonomy She doesn’t stay stable for long Her stump
swings over her making her fall and hit a trolley A scalpel
resting on the edge trembles falls and just misses Rosalie

The unbalanced hand charges down the corridor as far as the
feet of a professor busy writing on an information board
She steadies herself in extremis and retreats into the room
As she passes near the fallen eye she notices a small
reflection in the pupil Rosalie turns around and sees a
small window ajar at the back of the room Next to it there
are metal lockers and an anatomical skeleton

She begins her ascent of the skeleton The bones creak and
rattle as Rosalie climbs the ribs and then the skull

The lab door opens rolling the eye away the professor
enters The sound of bone scraping catches his attention but
when he turns toward the skeleton everything seems normal
Perplexed he goes to the open fridge and the objects on the
ground

Rosalie emerges from behind the skull She launches herself
and jumps on the cabinet causing the skull to break on the
floor The professor rushes over but sees nothing The
hand advances to the top of the lockers out of sight of the
man crouching down to pick up the pieces of skull

Meanwhile with one finger Rosalie discreetly opens the door
of the last locker and points it toward the window Hidden
behind the door clinging with her fingertips she progresses
towards freedom when a squeak from the locker hinge draws
the professors attention He walks determinedly toward the
lockers Rosalie twitches The professor reaches out to the
door as he walks on the eye which explodes like a pea

PROFESSOR
Euark Pfff

Disgusted the man insistently wipes his sole on the floor
before closing the door of the locker A movement on the
windowsill catches his attention but too late Rosalie took
advantage of the distraction to escape The man closes the
window unknowingly trapping Rosalie on the narrow outer
edge high up

Rosalie relaxes ‘sits’ on the edge her fingers in the air
In front of her the roofs of Paris The sun has not come up
yet

Rosalie leans over its high A small squeak draws her
attention a TV antenna vibrating in the wind A meter maybe
less just in front

The hand steadies herself and propels herself forward She
hits the antenna but fails to catch it and disappears into
the void
EXTINT RABAT HOUSE BEACH GARDEN (FLASHBACK)

Rosalie 2 falls hands first against the cement tiles
Attached to her Naoufel spits out his pacifier before
starting to cry His father comes running up behind him

Childhood memories scroll by chaotic fragmented Rosalie
turns over the cylinder in a baby’s toy Covered with paint
she puts her imprint on a wall Determined she crawls to an
electrical outlet Her index finger is removed from a snotty
nostril A finger annoys the telescopic eyes of a snail
Resolute Rosalie reaches out to the thorns of a rose bush in
bloom her thumb squeezing out the blood that bursts from the
end of the index finger

The beach Rosalie emerges from the sand Naoufel child is
lying on his towel Through his glasses he observes the sand
flowing from his palm His parents are with him

END FLASHBACK

EXT PARIS GUTTER - DAY

Rosalie 20 alone is lying in a gutter unconscious A
pigeon leans over her Next to them there is a nest with
eggs one of them is broken A piece of the shell is stuck to
Rosalies finger

Seeing the carnage the pigeon protests and pecks Rosalie
with its beak No reaction It puts its head under Rosalie
and begins to push her out of the gutter over the edge onto
the street It is difficult Rosalie is heavy The bird’s
feet scratch the zinc gutter Rosalie is about to fall

This is a rude wake-up With a reflex action Rosalie bends
and closes around her assailant’s neck The pigeon panics and
flaps its wings in an attempt to escape hitting its eggs
skidding on the zinc

It takes off a few centimeters falls skids along the
gutter hits the edge Rosalie tightens her grip so as not to
fall the pigeons neck breaks cleanly Its lifeless body
lies in the gutter but its head hangs in the air with
Rosalie holding on

The lull is short-lived The bird glides gently Rosalie
tries to climb up the body to cling to the feathers but
it’s too late The pigeon wins and falls She lands brutally
in the bottom of a dumpster Black

He casts an indifferent glance at the young people who are
standing in front of a building door before disappearing
into one of the buildings

Naoufel discreetly closes the apartment door behind him The
living room is kitsch and yet dull decorated with marine
trinkets a stuffed swordfish a ship’s helm

His uncle Samir is slouched in his chair in front of a soccer
match The pale glow of the TV is the only light a well-
filled glass of whiskey on the coffee table bills scattered
Naoufel stealthily walks behind him but is stopped by Samir
who speaks to him without even turning around

SAMIR
Didn’t you forget something

Naoufel goes back takes money out of his pocket and puts it
in a box on the unit by the entrance Samir mutes the TV to
listen to the money resonate in the box only turning the
volume up again once the last coin has fallen

Naoufel parts the hallway bead curtain and opens the door of
the room he shares with his cousin Raouf

He interrupts his cousin in full coitus with a young woman
SANDRA She recoils on seeing him

SANDRA
(gasp) Oh

NAOUFEL
Oh so-sorry (he closes the door)

Naoufel then sees the post-it note on the door ‘I’m with
Sandra’ surrounded by hearts On the back a dick has been
drawn and its signed Raouf

Meanwhile behind the door Raouf is trying to convince his
girlfriend

RAOUF (0S)
No wait What are you doing babe

Rosalie emerges from the middle of garbage bags The dumpster
is packed full With her fingertips she tries to lift the
lid Too heavy She crawls to where the light is coming in
tries to get out that way Just then a garbage truck arrives
and garbage collectors grab the dumpster with Rosalie still
inside The dumpster tips Rosalie tries desperately to grab
the ledge but she is dumped with the rest of the garbage into
the gaping truck The ruthless metal press compresses
everything

EXT GARBAGE TRUCK - NIGHT

Sitting on the top of the garbage in the back of the truck is
the dead pigeon that fell with Rosalie Suddenly it seems to
come back to life Under it a small can pushes and releases
the bird and it manages to extricate itself from the pile of
garbage It’s Rosalie who has found refuge in a can of
ravioli She stands up on her fingers with the tin can on
her back she looks like a hermit crab She goes quietly
toward the exit

A garbage collector notices the tin can but it falls off the
truck and bounces on the road before he can stop ite

EXT SIDEWALK - NIGHT

Rosalie lands on the sidewalk As soon as she lands a skater
strikes the tin can which begins to spin like a top
spilling tomato juice in their path

Rosalie staggers a bit before recovering her balance and
seeing a subway station She rushes to it

In the back of a passing car a child watches the can of
ravioli running along the ground in amazement

EXT ENTREE METRO - NIGHT

Rosalie gets ready to go down the stairs but backs out at the
last moment a man is coming up

Visibly drunk the man stops on the ramp He stays there
leaning for a moment exhausted barely standing Rosalie
takes advantage of the opportunity to jump down the steps
the staggering man just has enough time to glimpse the tin
can overtake him on the stairs

INT SUBWAY HALLWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT

The subway station is almost deserted Rosalie still hidden
in her can of ravioli takes care to avoid a couple at the
turn of a hallway She reaches an escalator but no luck
it’s going in the opposite direction Rosalie is committed to
it anyway The task turns out to be perilous and she rocks
forward descends the staircase and tumbles onto the platform
still in her can Just then a subway comes into the station

At the last second Rosalie manages to grab the footplate
The subway cuts the can of ravioli immediately and Rosalie
falls a few inches from the rails She quickly takes refuge
against the wall covered with tomato sauce and trembling

INT RAILS - NIGHT

Attracted by the scent of tomato a snarling rat turns toward
her behind her Rosalie jumps and flip-flops The rat slowly
approaches her sniffs her Above them the passengers get on
and off the train The rodent risks two licks on Rosalies
index finger gently and suddenly it bites her Two more
rats emerge from the darkness and fall on Rosalie biting
her scratching her She manages to break free to flee but
the rats are close behind She catches one by the throat but
the other two attack her and force her to let go

Rosalie notices a lighter and picks it up as she is dragged
into a hole under the platform Black the lighter clicks A
flame glows making the rats look red as they squeak
frightened Rosalie waves the flame in front of her like a
torch keeping her attackers at bay but for how long Above
them the noise of the closing doors the subway sets off A
rat springs at Rosalie who stops his momentum by throwing the
lighter at his muzzle The hand jumps on the rails avoiding
a guide wheel and clings to the axle of a moving car

Rosalie sees the tunnel and its neon scroll The subway goes
out into the air The street the buildings the sky The day
is beginning

scooter driven by Naoufel The scooter zig-zags between

The handlebars hit the rearview mirror of a car Naoufel
turns around without slowing his frantic slalom

Sudden braking The scooter wheel seizes slides on the wet
ground and Naoufel scrapes along the side of a car which has

lowers the window

DRIVER

NAOUFEL

NAOUFEL (CONTD)
Shit Shit shit shit

The car restarts and goes with no more comment Naoufel
stays in the middle of the crossroads like an idiot

EEEY HEY OH

Naoufel puts the pizzas back in the delivery box Frustrated

NAOUFEL (CONTD)
Fuck Dammit

He sets off again on his scooter in the rain He has to
drive slowly because of his twisted handlebars

INT HALLWAY - EVENING

In front of the main door of an apartment block Naoufel’s
scooter is parked in the pouring rain

Naoufel is standing in front of the intercom in the entry
hall his eyes hidden behind his wet glasses The rain is
making as much noise indoors as outdoors A female voice
coming through the intercom wakes him suddenly from his
dream

INTERCOM

He turns toward the glazed double door and waits for someone
to open it

It doesn’t open

NAOUFEL (CONTD)
Can you can you open the door

Naoufel takes a moment to respond he seems to be waking up
bit by bit

NAOUFEL

could do

NAOUFEL

I said hello I said Hello Fast

While the customer answers he looks at the order on the
pizza box automatically Neapolitan extra onion Mrs
Martinez

INTERCOM

Rosalie clinging to the handle
NAOUFEL

minutes late

INTERCOM

do

NAOUFEL

(resigned) It’s your call Mrs
Martinez

INTERCOM

explanations) My super was supposed

NAOUFEL

Naoufel leaning against the wall next to the intercom has
not managed to open the door Pizza box still in hand he
looks at the rain pouring on his twisted scooter

INTERCOM
Now its official you are not
getting a tip

He smiles quickly at the thought of it

INTERCOM (CONTD)
Don’t move I’1ll just grab a
sweater

Naoufel lifts the lid of the pizza box and closes it
disillusioned

CUT TO
He rings the intercom again

INTERCOM (CONTD)
Gimme a second Ill be right
there

NAOUFEL
Don’t bother

INTERCOM
Why’s that

Naoufel rubs his neck in embarrassment

NAOUFEL
Uhm I’m afraid the pizza and I
were in a small accident It
doesn’t look too good

INTERCOM
How bad was it

He takes a quick look inside the box The pizza is completely
crushed

NAOUFEL
It looks like a pizza topped
with the chewed-up remains of
another pizza

INTERCOM
(interrupting) No I meant the
accident you didnt get hurt
right

Naoufel surprised by this sudden attention lifts his head
toward the intercom

NAOUFEL
Me No I’m fine Thanks for

Naoufel smiles agreeing

NAOUFEL

NAOUFEL
Yeah Well you should just
reorder it tell them what

Good night

He walks away from the intercom

CUT TO

Naoufel hasn’t left He is sitting next to a big green plant
in the entrance hall eating the destroyed pizza At the
other end of the room the intercom starts to crackle

INTERCOM
Are you still there

Naoufel turns his head towards the voice but does not answer
The pizza topping takes advantage of his lack of attention to
slide off Naoufel spreads his legs but too late his pants
take a direct hit

NAOUFEL
Ah shit

He rubs his crotch and picks up the bottle of beer at his
feet

INTERCOM
Shitty evening right

Naoufel gets up and opening the door leans outside to see
the top of the building The rain is deafening

NAOUFEL
(talking loudly while chewing) 35th
floor right Even from down here
it gives you vertigo

He goes back inside
INTERCOM
Is that my pizza you’re eating Is

it any good

NAOUFEL
Extra onion was a bad choice

INTERCOM
Unbelievable

Naoufel puts the rest of the slice into the empty box and
puts it all in the trash He looks out of the glazed door

NAOUFEL
(loudly) What do you see from up
there

INTERCOM

I can see your scooter it looks a
little sad

NAOUFEL
When you look straight ahead what
do you see

INTERCOM
Nothing Nothing vertical only the
horizon

Naoufel peers into the raindrops

NAOUFEL
(quietly) That must be very
comforting

INTERCOM

(louder) What What did you say I
couldnt hear you

NAOUFEL
(louder) I said it must be
comforting to be cut off from the
world like that (pause) To see
nothing To hear nothing Can you
hear the rain

Naoufel draws closer to the intercom listening to the
answer

INTERCOM

Rain doesnt make any noise At
least not up here it just passes
through I do hear the wind
though When it blows through the
high rises it howls It feels
like Im on an ice floe in the
middle of a a storm sheltered
in my igloo

Naoufel turns hearing an old lady enter the hall with an
umbrella and a shopping cart She stands in front of her
mailbox and searches her bag while watching Naoufel out of
the corner of her eye

INTERCOM (CONTD)
And when it blows really hard when
theres a lot of wind I can feel
the building swaying I don’t
know It feels like

NAOUFEL
like the whole world is drunk

There is some laughter in the voice The old lady MRS
LUSSAC has reached the intercom

cousin who is playing with the disconnected telephone plug
Raouf looks over his shoulder at him as he leaves

EXT PARK —- DAY

It’s morning the park is frosty Rosalie wakes up with
difficulty and shivers with horror she is covered with
ants swarming on her back Panicking she struggles to get
rid of insects and retreats to the frozen river

Rosalie slips but manages to climb onto a twig caught in the
ice out of reach of stubborn insects Unfortunately the
twig like the ice is too fragile for her weight Rosalie
sinks into the water swept away by the current trapped
under the thin layer of ice Her fingers hammer the frozen
surface in vain

She finally spots a hole in the ice created by a tennis ball
floating on the surface Rosalie must act quickly she lets
herself sink to the bottom of the river leans on the bed
and propels herself towards the surface She clings to the
tennis ball like a buoy in the ocean

Suddenly hairy legs break the ice as they run towards her a
big labrador picks up the ball and Rosalie in its mouth A
whistle calls the dog

BLIND MAN (0S)
Edison

Well trained Edison returns to his master quickly with the
ball and Rosalie The man sitting on a bench strokes the
dog’s head without commenting on the hand in his mouth

BLIND MAN (CONTD)
That’s it that’s a good boy Come
on

He picks up a white cane his dog’s harness and they walk
away The BLIND MAN is not aware that Edison is bringing
Rosalie with them

hand over the microphone to muffle the noise

NAOUFEL

GABRIELLE
Hello there

A few meters further on Gabrielle is staring at him not
moving a cat in her arms Naoufel pulls himself together
his body is getting carried away He smiles clumsily doesn’t
know what to do with his hands

NAOUFEL
Hi
Gabrielle turns her head toward the workshop
GABRIELLE
Gigi

and GEORGES head appears at the corner of the wall
A man of some years well built in blue work clothes He
looks suspiciously at Naoufel

GEORGES
Hello can I help you

Naoufels stupid smile gives way to embarrassment His
panicked look finally rests on the workshop door where ads
are taped haphazardly He pulls off the biggest one and hands
it to Georges

NAOUFEL
Actually I’m here because of the
ad Are you still looking for an
apprentice

Gabrielle frowns

GABRIELLE
Which ad

Georges puts on his glasses and reads the sheet confused

GEORGES
Oh that’s been there a while It’s
pretty old Sorry

He removes his glasses and gives the paper back to Naoufel
who pretends to be disappointed

NAOUFEL
Ah

Gabrielle gives a pharmacy bag to Georges and kisses him
affectionately on the cheek

GABRIELLE

bench behind him

Georges walks into the workshop he’s forgotten Naoufel
already The young man has forgotten him too he’s watching
Gabrielle staring into space until he comes back to the
ad

INT JOINERY WORKSHOP - DAY
Naoufel stumbles into the workshop the ad still in his hand

NAOUFEL
Hire me Hire me you won’t regret
it I promise

Carried away by his enthusiasm Naoufel knocks a board on
trestles He puts Rosalie on it instinctively but the board
is covered in wet paint

GEORGES
Watch out

Naoufel takes back his hand quickly embarrassed Georges
sighs and throws him a cloth to dry himself before heading
to his office in the back of the workshop

GEORGES (CONTD)
That ad’s ten years old I haven’t
taken an apprentice in

NAOUFEL
Take me on probation What’s there
to lose

GEORGES

Time It’s a lot of work to teach
an apprentice It takes time I’m
too old for that now

He puts down his meds and pours a coffee to which he adds
something from a metal flask Naoufel follows him not
dropping the conversation or the ad

NAOUFEL
Exactly I can ease your burden

GEORGES
Ease my burden What burden

He glances at him unconvinced Silence Naoufel looks around
him so as not to break down

bravery disappears he closes up slowly looking down at his
ad

NAOUFEL

The metallic sound of the spoon stirring the coffee stops for
a second

GEORGES
(he calms down a little) They’re
dead

He drinks a mouthful

GEORGES (CONTD)

He turns to Naoufel again who lowers his head Silence

NAOUFEL

NAOUFEL
(weakly) I don’t know

Naoufel has given up He gently puts down the ad looking
away George hides his sympathy behind his cup As he leaves
Naoufel points to the painted wooden board

NAOUFEL (CONTD)
And um sorry about that

GEORGES
(more gently) No big deal it’s an
easy fix (he calls to him

suddenly) Do you have a light No

Naoufel is in the doorway Georges moves towards him still
looking at his cup

A pretty and bright apartment green plants an upright
piano vinyls Slumped on the floor Edison the guide dog is
sleeping peacefully Rosalie not without difficulty manages
to extricate herself from his mouth without waking him

Dribbling but free she crosses in front of the blind man
safely and runs to the front door of the apartment She
notices the handle and the latch which are high up already
thinking about the next stage of her escape when she hears
music

The blind man is sitting at the piano and playing a piece of
Bach (Concerto in A Major) Rosalie watches him and slowly
approaches him hypnotized

CUT TO

Rosalie has climbed onto the piano to watch the man play She
studies his agile hands moving on the keys Rosalie is
transported it is no longer the blind man she sees on the
piano but the pianist Naoufel the one from her childhood
dreams He moves from side to side to the rhythm of the
melody concentration on his face Rosalie is part of him

her a small complicit smile

glass of whiskey on the piano but grabs Rosalie instead

down on to the piano keys The harsh notes betray her
position and the pianist brutally slams the lid closed

Rosalie jumps to the ground the nail of her index finger
bruised by the flap No time to dwell she just avoids the
man’s step and takes refuge under the sofa

BLIND MAN (CONTD)
Damned rats Edison Fetch Come
on Get it Get it Get it Yes

The dog wakes up and runs after Rosalie barking Following
the sound his master swipes his cane all over the place
under the sofa Rosalie slaloms between the cane and the
dogs jaws clings to the slats and finds herself cornered
against the wall near a ventilation grill A violent swipe
from the cane bends the grill in half creating enough space
for the distraught hand to sneak into

stepping out of the shower to answer the phone

INT BATHROOM —- DAY

Rosalie takes the opportunity to turn the grill and jump on a
clothesline

She walks on her fingertips along the dryer when she hears
chirping Under the clotheshorse a baby is lying on his back
in his little bath He seems very amused by Rosalies
presence The hand brushes against a clothespin and makes a
sock fall which makes the baby laugh more

The woman comes back into the room the handset wedged
against her ear in full discussion with a girlfriend

YOUNG WOMAN
Hey

Dunno around eight0

During her conversation she puts the sock back on the
clotheshorse takes the baby out of the bath and wraps him in
a towel Absorbed by the discussion she does not notice
Rosalie but the baby does not stop staring at the hand The
woman leaves the room turning off the light the baby in her
arms

Rosalie comes down from her hiding place and climbs in the
small bathtub still full of water She lets herself sink to
the bottom watching all the dirt rise to the surface

long boards out of the truck

GEORGES (CONTD)
Ready Lift One two three

They go back to the workshop struggling with the boards

GEORGES (CONTD)
So you have tools accessories and
instruments The cat (the cat
runs through Naoufel’s legs) The
tool is what mankind uses to
transform material Let’s put it
over there

The two men let go of the planks in a cloud of dust anda
cough from Georges The carpenter shows the instruments on
his workbench

GEORGES (CONTD)
(panting) My workbench that’s an
accessory it doesn’t transform the
material I use it to

The noise is deafening the jigsaw is running at full speed
Naoufel at the controls uses it to cut the small board At
his side Georges needs to shout his advice

GEORGES (CONTD)

the most important step After
that it’s easy you just follow
the layout Anybody can do this
Good work starts with a good
working drawing

He is interrupted by a coughing fit

NAOUFEL
What’s a working drawing

Naoufel stops the saw and examines the cut piece An
apparition puts an end to Georges’ coughing Gabrielle takes
off her scooter helmet on the doorstep She looks at the two
men in turn visibly upset Naoufel tries a shy greeting

CUT TO

Naoufel watches Gabrielle telling off Georges through the
office windows her voice muffled by the walls He is still
holding his piece of wood in his hands

GABRIELLE
Helping you Helping you what Stop

GEORGES
He was at a loss

GABRIELLE
So what

GEORGES
Leave it I’m just old he can’t

Naoufel brushes the tools hanging on the wall with his
fingertips but he is so absorbed by the scene between
Gabrielle and Georges that his shin hits a beam knocking
down a pile of planks He hurts Rosalie trying to catch them

NAOUFEL
Ah

From the office Gabrielle looks at him wearily The phone
rings Georges answers

GEORGES
Hello

Naoufel looks up at Gabrielle with sheepish eyes

INT JOINERY WORKSHOP - DAY

dotted over Rosalie’s fingers Naoufel watches the situation

Their conversation is interrupted by Georges who pokes his
head out of the office phone against his ear

Encouraged Naoufel points out a photo smiling

Gabrielle pouts doubtfully Naoufel watches her transfixed
as she turns the pages

GABRIELLE

beautiful double page spread of an
immense landscape and an Inuit in
the center) It’s just there’s
nothing there When will you ever
see anything like that in your
life We’ll never go there We’1l
never see that Except in a book

She loses her words

NAOUFEL
Just close your eyes

Gabrielle comes back to the present Naoufel stands up eyes
closed hands covering his ears nodding his head

NAOUFEL (CONTD)
--and put your hands over your
ears like this press your ears a
little one after the other very
softly like this If you do it

the next desk Mado is repeatedly pressing the microphone
button while watching Gabrielle She nods to the long line of
customers behind Naoufel

Without bothering to answer Gabrielle hands the pile of
books to Naoufel

GABRIELLE

see

MONTAGE IGLOO - WORKSHOP USINE ABANDONEE

Naoufel is building a wooden igloo similar to the one in the
book on the roof of the abandoned factory Days and music
give rhythm to his efforts

Alone in the workshop Naoufel unfolds a plan He draws the
curves with a compass cuts wood with a band saw and refines
his plan

With the help of a construction site pulley he hoists the
pieces of the igloo onto the roof of the building With chalk
and string he draws a circle on the ground the foundation
of his future construction Then he assembles the arches
screws the pieces together Days and nights combine in the
workshop where he cuts and polishes and on the roof where
he assembles Naoufel continues with his project

Until he positions the last board the igloo is finished

INT LIBRARY - DAY

Gabrielle is arranging books headphones on She sees Naoufel
looking for her between the rows of books When he reaches
her she removes her headphones and the music that
accompanied the construction of the igloo fades

Naoufel is brandishing a bear-shaped wooden key ring

NAOUFEL
Here as an apology I’m late

Gabrielle takes the bear out of politeness

GABRIELLE
(low confused) Thanks and
that’s

NAOUFEL
A bear

Mado in the next section grunts while arranging a book to
remind them where they are

NAOUFEL (CONTD)

it with some scrap wood

Gabrielle looks at him a little embarrassed

GABRIELLE
But did we have a date

NAOUFEL

He gives her the books he borrowed Gabrielle relaxes
understanding the mistake She places the books in the cart
and takes another one out

GABRIELLE

my favorites

Naoufel looks at the novel They look at each other Slight
embarrassment

Gabrielle has already walked away with her cart

EXT ROOFS - NIGHT

Clinging to a hanger and using it as a zip line Rosalie
slides on an electric cable between two Parisian buildings
She lands on a roof and continues on her way climbing from
one surface to the other zig zagging between the chimneys
with always the sight of the crane in the distance

Suddenly a masked figure passes next to her The hand
freezes and quickly hides between two chimneys The man is
wearing a dark sweatshirt with a hood and a backpack from
which hang big sticks poles for paint rollers

Always lurking in the shadows Rosalie sees the man turn his
head he is wearing a crow mask

The graffiti artist is also heading to the crane Rosalie
follows him He keeps his finger on a can of spray paint
leaving behind a trail of color on the walls and on an old
umbrella which is lying forgotten there His can emptied he
throws it on the ground and moves on Rosalie watches him
leave toward the rising sun

INT GEORGES’ TRUCK - DAY

spoiler

EXT WORKSHOP - DAY

Naoufel enters the yard with a cardboard box filled with
paintbrushes and pots of paint Raouf is there in
conversation with Gabrielle Sitting on Gabrielles scooter

cigarette with the other

Raouf drains the bottom of his coffee snapping his tongue
looking at his watch and goes to put his cup in the
workshop

RAOUF
Alright all good things must come
to an end (to Gabrielle) I told
you family makes him
uncomfortable (loud toward the
workshop) Hey Gigi thanks for the
coffee (to Gabrielle elegantly)

Raouf goes to his car Passing Naoufel he imitates a
blowjob looking him straight in the eye Then he slaps him
on the shoulder before trotting off again

NAOUFEL
You prick

RAOUF
(loud) Good to see you too (he
taps on his car and points to
Gabrielle and Naoufel) Counting on

Angrily Naoufel watches Raouf’s car leave sounding its
horn

GABRIELLE
He’s throwing a party
NAOUFEL
A party
GABRIELLE
I said yes but we don’t have to
go

Naoufel pulls himself together and goes to the workshop with
his cardboard box

NAOUFEL
Yeah yeah it’s a good idea
Youll pick me up on your scooter

GABRIELLE
OK

GEORGES
(from the workshop) Careful with my

Gabrielle smiles as she smokes

EXT OUTSIDE NAOUFEL’S BUILDING CITY - EVENING

engine to let Naoufel know She then sees him watching her
sitting on the workshop wall a ladder next to him a funny
smile on his lips He waves to her

Naoufel passes behind the rooftop billboard followed by
Gabrielle

NAOUFEL
(smiling) Come

Gabrielle crosses the plank bridge on all fours
GABRIELLE
Uhh this better be worth it
CUT TO

Naoufel is climbing the stairs that lead to the roof
Gabrielle is a few steps in front of him Naoufel watches her
with a strange insistence that Gabrielle notices

CUT TO
Naoufel stops just before the door onto the roof He puts on
his cap without a word Gabrielle looks at him a little
puzzled before copying putting up her hood

EXT ON THE ROOF TERRACE - NIGHT

Naoufel removes the caps from two beers and hands one to
Gabrielle

NAOUFEL
So Whadda ya think

She looks at the wooden igloo on the roof confused He
watches for her reaction

NAOUFEL (CONTD)
It’s an igloo

Gabrielle walks across the roof and puts her hand on the
surface of the igloo patting the wood Her hand moves toward
the small entrance tunnel crouching and squinting inside

NAOUFEL (CONTD)
Do you like it

GABRIELLE
(surprised) Did you build this

He nods his head

EXT ON THE ROOF TERRACE - NIGHT

Gabrielle and Naoufel drink a beer sitting on the edge of
the roof

NAOUFEL
Do you believe in fate

Gabrielle questions him with her look

NAOUFEL (CONTD)
No seriously

GABRIELLE
Like everything is defined in
advance And we just follow that

path
NAOUFEL
Yeah
GABRIELLE
And that you couldn’t change a
thing
NAOUFEL

We think we can But it’s an
illusion Unless we do something
completely unpredictable and
irrational It’s the only way to
counter fate for good

Gabrielle turns the beer in her bottle as if to stir up the
bottom of her thoughts She draws on her cigarette

GABRIELLE
Something like what

She gets caught up in the game and listens to Naoufel
pensive

NAOUFEL
Something um It could be I
dunno Anything

(MORE)

NAOUFEL (CONTD)
(he mimes with two fingers on the
railing) Say you’re walking
peacefully you pretend to go one
way but you fake it and go the
other way you deviate

His hand is close to Gabrielle’s his face is too They look
at each other for a moment

NAOUFEL (CONTD)
And boom You jump on that crane
(smile) Something you would never
do You shouldn’t have done it but
you did do it because it was right
it got you somewhere else (he is
watching her) And you don’t regret
it Something like that

Silence
She stares at him she seems to be waiting for something
GABRIELLE

And then what And once you’ve
fooled destiny then what

NAOUFEL
And then you You don’t let it
catch up to you You barrel
through and cross your fingers

Gabrielle drinks a mouthful of beer Suddenly overcome with
laughter she spits out beer slobbering and coughing
Naoufel smiles without understanding

NAOUFEL (CONTD)
What

Gabrielle wipes her mouth a little embarrassed

GABRIELLE
Sorry (she laughs and coughs) You
hungry

NAOUFEL

I ordered a pizza

EXT ROOFS OF PARIS - EVENING

Rosalie is sheltering behind a big pipe The crane is a
hundred yards ahead She seems very close

Rosalie observes the graffiti artist once again in her path
who is painting the front of a wall with a roller attached to
the end of a long handle He kneels down arranges his
things then leaves leaving the way clear for the hand

Rosalie leans over the edge Below cars pass by at full
speed on the beltway Rosalie moves back and looks up The
crane is on the other side so close

On the facade below her graffiti in large white letters
‘I’M HERE’

INT IGLOO - NIGHT
Outside the igloo Naoufel writes something on the pizza box

GABRIELLE (0S)
It’s probably cold by now

NAOUFEL
Just give me one minute

Gabrielle sits cross-legged in the igloo It is lit by a
small lantern hanging from the roof and Gabrielle has fun
tipping it with her fingertips

GABRIELLE
(joking) You should have ordered
sushi Don’t you get a discount
from your old job

Naoufel enters the igloo stooping He is holding the pizza
proudly on the end of his fingers like a server ina
restaurant a large smile on his lips

NAOUFEL
It’s not just any pizza

GABRIELLE
What did you order

He puts the box down and pushes it toward her She reads what
is written on the top

GABRIELLE (CONTD)
‘Neapolitan pizza extra onions
Mrs Martinez’ (silence) It’s

NAOUFEL
It’s me The the delivery guy
Fast Pizza That was your order
right

Naoufel observes her closely watching for the slightest of
reactions as a sign but she shows nothing She looks at the
igloo around her as if the pieces of the puzzle are falling
into place in her head Naoufel beats his chest and adopts a
stern look mimicking a pistol with Rosalie

NAOUFEL (CONTD)
(imitating Lee Van Cleef) “I always
follow my job through You know
that” BANG (he imitates the sound
of a shotgun) It’s in ‘The Good
The Bad and The

GABRIELLE
--The Ugly’ yeah I know that

Naoufel opens the pizza box cheerfully

NAOUFEL
Really I love that movie It’s my
favorite Van Cleef is

He takes a piece but Gabrielle gets up and walks past him
without saying anything Naoufel watches her the pizza
hanging from his hand

EXT ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT

NAOUFEL
What are you doing

Gabrielle gets up takes two tentative steps tries to gather
her thoughts Naoufel tries to get out of the igloo to join
her but she stops him by standing in front of the exit She
turns to him her eyes searching for an answer

GABRIELLE
What a lousy plan

Naoufel watches her from the tunnel like a dog ina
doghouse

NAOUFEL
What plan It’s not a plan

GABRIELLE
All that bullshit So you can
bang the girl in the igloo Is that
it

Gabrielle stays remarkably calm Naoufel exits the tunnel
quickly so he can explain

NAOUFEL
Of course not Who do you think I
am

Gabrielle seems lost in her thoughts she stares into space
Naoufel tries to calm the situation with an intimate and
confidential tone

NAOUFEL (CONTD)
When we spoke on the intercom I
wanted to meet you I found out
where you worked I ended up
following you It’s a simple
story I complicated it a little
that’s all You listening

Gabrielle walks in front of him to get her purse

GABRIELLE
Yeah

She is walking away He increases the volume a notch tries
sarcasm bitterness

NAOUFEL
What was I supposed to do Tell
me ‘Hey hi it’s me the delivery
guy the guy who can’t even open a
door Let’s have a drink’ Would
that have worked

Gabrielle shrugs her shoulders without stopping Naoufel
plays the romance card

NAOUFEL (CONTD)
I took that job just so I could see
you again You have to admit it’s
quite chivalrousno

At these words Gabrielle turns to Naoufel who shrinks back

GABRIELLE
My uncle Did you think about my
uncle When are you gonna tell him
you don’t give a shit about him or

his job

NAOUFEL
I love this job Look at what I
built

Naoufel indicates the igloo the cuts on his hands but
Gabrielle interrupts him

GABRIELLE
He’s sick You didn’t notice that
Naoufel is dismayed Gabrielles eyes pierce through him
NAOUFEL
But no he’s just a little old
that’s all

Gabrielle turns away putting her hood up

GABRIELLE
Asshole

NAOUFEL
What’s wrong with him Is it bad

She slams the roof door in Naoufel’s face He spreads his
arms thrown

He returns to the igloo grabs a board and hits the igloo
violently to drive a nail in properly In vain the board
breaks instead The pizza is still inside intact and
neglected

On the edge of the roof the two empty beer bottles are still
there Naoufel grabs one and uses it to push the other over
the edge

EXT PARISIAN ROOFS AND BELTWAY - NIGHT

The wind sweeps along the roofs It dislodges a drop of fresh
paint which slides between Rosalie’s fingers before flying
off the edge The paint explodes below on the beltway filled
with cars that roll past at full speed

An astronaut the astronaut of Naoufel’s childhood dreams is
sitting on one of the large billboards on the beltway He
stares at Rosalie before turning his head to look at the
other side of the road The crane is reflected on his helmet

Rosalie firmly holds the handle of the closed umbrella She
is waiting for the right moment She is waiting

The wind makes her lose her balance She just manages to
straighten up and tightens her grip on the umbrella

Further down the astronaut nods his head as if to encourage
her

The umbrella is moving Rosalie concentrates and presses the
button that opens it The wind rushes into the canvas
sending Rosalie into the air

But the makeshift paraglider instead of flying slowly falls
towards the traffic turning on itself Rosalie clings as
best she can to the edge of the roof panicking but to no
avail

The astronaut observes the unstoppable descent

The hand tries desperately to move up the pole but slips and
catches the handle Landing in the traffic Rosalie just
avoids a car but is hit full on by the headlamp of another A
truck is heading straight for her The impact is imminent

STARRY SKY

In a starry void Rosalie whirls drifting with her umbrella
The astronaut watches her pass by

EXT BELTWAY - NIGHT

The umbrella has just avoided the truck It grazes the side
of the vehicle and the turbulence propels the umbrella high
in the air

The astronaut waves to Rosalie as she rises up

Swept along by the wind Rosalie flies over the city towards
the crane

INT SAMIR’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The apartment is dark smoky and crowded Raoufs evening is
in full swing Alcohol marijuana underground hip-hop video
games people dancing or sprawled everywhere Naoufel is at
the kitchen counter a drink in his hand untouched by the
atmosphere Raouf jostles him putting his arm around his
shoulders causing him to spill his drink

RAOUF
Hey where is your girl

NAOUFEL
She’s not my girl (he dries
himself) It’s nothing

Raouf teases him by running his index finger over his lips
Naoufel pushes him away

NAOUFEL (CONTD)
Just fuck off Get off me man

Naoufel refills his glass trying to ignore him Raouf stubs
out his cigarette and looks at him defiantly Naoufel
prepares to drink but Raouf beats him to it by emptying his
glass in one gulp

NAOUFEL (CONTD)
(groans) Get lost

As a final insult Raouf ruffles his hair before returning to
the dance floor

RAOUF
Corinne We were just talking about
you

Naoufel protests silently in front of his empty glass He
gets up for a moment to grab a bottle A guy takes the
opportunity to take his place

NAOUFEL
Excuse me I was sitting there

PASCAL turns around and looks at him disdainfully He
indicates the neighboring space which is empty

PASCAL
Why are you busting my balls There
is a stool right there

Annoyed Naoufel sits on the nearby seat without saying
anything

EXT ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT

Rosalie hovers gently hanging from her umbrella She passes
the crane and continues her flight to the abandoned factory
The dilapidated windows reflect her as she approaches

INT SAMIR’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Naoufel slaps Pascal on the shoulder determined to explain
himself He points to his glass on the counter in front of
Pascal

NAOUFEL
Actually that’s my drink I just
left for a second to um I was
sitting there that’s my stool

The guy takes his time to turn around He grabs Naoufels
glass

PASCAL
Oh that’s your drink

NAOUFEL
Yeah

PASCAL

You should’ve said so

He clears his throat before sending a thick gob of spit into
it Suddenly Naoufel pushes his head onto the counter
Pascal responds with a jab from his elbow Naoufel sends him
to the floor Naoufel throws himself on him to beat him and
Raouf arrives to hold him back

BLACK

Small fly footsteps that echo like in a cave In total
darkness a fly appears explores the space disappears and
then comes back She seems to be flying around something

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

The fly lands near the blank look of a goat The animal is

grazing peacefully in the night at the edge of a road lined
with a forest It notices a more appetizing tuft of grass on
the other side of the road It walks toward it the fly now
resting on its horn

INT ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT
The interior of the factory is empty dilapidated Whats
left of the umbrella is gently tossed by the wind caught in

a broken window

Rosalie is lying on the ground motionless among the pieces
of glass A huge fly hovers over her

In the cold morning light Naoufel returns to the workshop

to fall his fathers watch still on his wrist

INT WORKSHOP - DAY

NAOUFEL
Gigi Gigi

Naoufel looks in the workshop and then in Georges office He
has a black eye and his glasses are taped across the bridge

He smiles when he sees the instructions left on the table
numbered by post-its 1 - some aspirin 2 - a glass of water
and 3 - a diagram of the work to be done

Naoufel drinks down his aspirin while analyzing the
instructions He takes a board places it on the bench makes
his measurements draws a line with the square A fly lands
on the board Trying to drive it away Naoufel misdraws his
line

INT ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT

Rosalie still lying on the factory floor has a slight
spasm

INT RABAT HOUSE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

The fly walks along the windows in Naoufels parents’ house
The little boy is watching it Rosalie resting on the
windowsill takes care not to move too fast not to scare the
insect

INT WORKSHOP - DAY

Naoufel continues to work without paying attention to the
fly walking on the bay window of the workshop

The young man sets up the machine The band saw starts
powerful and thick

INT ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT

Rosalie gets up She crosses the factory floor strewn with
broken glass staggering groggy but determined

INT WORKSHOP - DAY

Naoufel slides the wooden board under the saw along his

line The deafening screech immediately hurts his still-foggy
head and he puts on a helmet with ear defenders

EXT ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT

Rosalie rushes along Naoufels makeshift bridge between the
building under construction and the billboard in front of his
house

INT WORKSHOP - DAY

Naoufel holds the board firmly to make a clean straight cut
He is about to push the wood through the saw again when the
fly lands on Rosalie He chases it away with an irritated
hand motion a little near the saw

EXT ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT

Rosalie goes up the ladder to the roof step by step

INT WORKSHOP - DAY

The fly lands on the side of the machine Naoufel stops
working and tries to catch it without success

With his helmet on he cannot hear either the buzzing of the
insect or the saw which is still moving

INT NAOUFEL’S STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rosalie reaches the roof and lies exhausted on the skylight
of Naoufels studio apartment After a few seconds of
respite she decides to enter and raises it gently

INT WORKSHOP - DAY

Naoufel watches concentrates with patient movements

The fly walks down the machine It advances on the metal
wall slowly unhurried

It finally stops a few inches from the saw It rubs its front
legs together

Naoufel closes his fist around it Captured

He scarcely has time to be proud of his achievement His
watch strap gets caught up in the teeth of the saw blade

He tries to pull Rosalie toward him but it’s too late the
saw has begun to cut Blood Naoufel cries out first in
surprise then in pain

INT NAOUFEL’S STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rosalie approaches Naoufels bed where he is curled up
sleeping Rosalie looks at him for a moment then climbs onto
the bed

His glasses still taped in the middle are placed next to
him Naoufel turns in his sleep There is an empty space
where his right hand should be

INT WORKSHOP - DAY

The saw is still running Breathing heavily Naoufel holds
his bloody wrist against his body With his left hand he
grabs the right still clenched in a fist lying on the
table Naoufel sways and collapses

Rosalie falls to the floor next to the blood-stained glasses
Sneaking between his index finger and his middle finger just
below the mole the fly escapes

INT NAOUFEL’S STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rosalie looks at the bandage on Naoufels arm which stops so
abruptly She lies there in her place where she was should
be As if for a few moments she and he were still
connected She remembers

EXT BEACH - DAY (FLASHBACK)

The young Naoufel lifting Rosalie letting the sand slip
between his fingers

dreaming right now of the beach when they were still
together He brings his arm up against him breaking the
spell

INT NAOUFEL’S STUDIO APARTMENT - DAY

Naoufel suddenly becomes serious He stops tapping on the
recorder

Rosalie is hiding under Naoufel’s bed An open cassette box

is lying on the floor next to her It is the cassette with no
name

The recording moves on to another moment Rosalie curls up

INT CAR - RABAT - NIGHT

SAJI

At the wheel Saji turns to look at his young son in the
back Naoufel holds up his microphone to better capture what
his parents are saying

NAOUFEL

the cocktail party after the
concert But we didn’t So now

Saji smiles Sitting in the passenger seat Louisa is
freshening up her make up

LOUISA

NAOUFEL
But this time I won’t have school

She looks at him tenderly

INT CAR - RABAT - NIGHT

Young Naoufel leans out of the car window holding out his
microphone with Rosalie

He looks at the trees bordering the road Its night the sky
is illuminated by stars He is too focused on the sound of
the wind in his headphones that he does not hear his father

SAJI
Naoufel (louder) Naoufel

His father leans back to bring him back inside the vehicle

the road but hits it violently The microphone is still

hanging out the window scraping on the blacktop the car
tilts and falls over smashing against the trees

Rosalie listens without moving under the bed Silence
‘Click’ the sound of a cassette rewinding ‘click’ The
cassette starts over again Before everything changede

hears a scooter enter the yard

It’s night Snow is falling and gathering on the skylight
Gabrielle is asleep on the bed the book in her hands
Rosalie comes out from under the chest of drawers

INT NAOUFEL’S BEDROOM - DAY

Gabrielle wakes up hearing a sound of dishes Intrigued she
opens the kitchen cupboard

Inside she discovers a small igloo made of sugar cubes
Rosalie watches her hidden near her construction behind a
pile of plates Gabrielle contemplates the strange message
then leaves the room

EXT ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

The roof and the igloo are covered with snow like the
landscapes that Naoufel and Gabrielle saw in the book

Gabrielle approaches the igloo there are no footprints She
looks inside and sees only two empty beer bottles

She gets up and looks around
Nobody

Just a wooden board covered with snow and positioned as a
springboard against the railing

She walks to the edge of the roof and looks at the empty
space below

Under the wooden board Naoufels recorder

Gabrielle puts the headphones on her ears and rewinds From
the door to the roof Rosalie is watching

Gabrielle presses ‘play’ She hears the cello

LOUISA (0S)
(surprised) Aaahh (laughing) Come

and the noise of cars in the distance It has been recorded
over from there

Naoufel presses the red RECPLAY button He is standing on
the roof with no snow yet the microphone in his hand He

climbs on the small railing and slowly lets the microphone
slip holding it by the cable

EXT ABANDONED FACTORY-— DAY

Gabrielle listens attentively to the cassette the wind
whistling like a revolution

EXT ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT

Still standing on the railing Naoufel spins the microphone
at the end of its cable like a propeller and then catches
it in his left hand He jumps back and knocks over a glass
bottle on his way back to the roof

EXT ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

Gabrielle hears the sound of a glass bottle rolling on the
floor She finds the bottle now covered with snow a little
further behind her

The sound stops for a moment then resumes with a scraping
sound

It is Naoufel who is carefully sliding the recorder on the
ground under the wooden board The device is still recording
Naoufel adjusts the board facing the crane

if someone is retreating on the roof She looks up to where
they should be

She presses the headphones with one hand to hear better
Nervous breaths

It is Naoufel who is breathing deeply to give himself
courage

the springboard just about where Gabrielle is and
appreciates the distance he has just jumped

The adrenaline running out a little he lies down on the
metal floor He laughs Snow starts to fall on him

EXT ABANDONED FACTORY- DAY

The recording has finished Gabrielle removes the headphones
smiling She looks toward the empty bridge where Naoufel
landed after his jump As if Naoufel and Gabrielle were
looking at each other from their own moments in time

EXT ABANDONED FACTORY - NIGHT

Naoufel lying on the crane looks at his sleeve floating in
the wind without a hand
