MARK

BETH

Just from a fall in the shower

VANESSA

I talked to Coach Jenny and she said
there was a detective and police going
through the boy’s locker room It was
blocked off all day Like a crime scene

KURT
They think someone pushed him down or
something

VANESSA

She didn’t say But she did tell me that
she told him about what happened with
creepy Bridget today during PE and he
wanted to question her

BETH
I wouldn’t put anything past that girl
She’s always like creeping around

KURT
(to Mark)

MARK
Got you covered bro

VANESSA
(re beers)
What if it’s the cops

KURT
Nah These woods are school property
they won’t come back here

BETH
(flirtatious)
Wouldn’t you guys rather stay and protect
us
Vanessa shoots Beth a look as the boys head off
VANESSA
(in Beth’s voice)
‘Wouldn’t you guys rather stay and
protect us’
(normal)
It would have been more subtle if you had
said ‘I want your penis in my mouth’

Beth scowls

EXT DIFFERENT PART OF WOODS - SAME
Kurt and Mark make their way through the trees

Bridget’s FEET RUN across the forest floor She’s breathing
heavy

Kurt and Mark catch a glimpse of her

KURT
You see that

They throw down their beers and GIVE CHASE

Bridget has a decent lead and nearly disappears into the
woods up ahead

It’s hard for Kurt and Mark to tell where she went while
they’re full-out running

Bridget trips and falls in the thick leaves slides down a
small hill

The boys stop

MARK
Where did they go
KURT
I don’t know but it looks like only one
person Let’s split up Cover more
ground

Fear crosses Mark’s face as Kurt starts to head off

MARK
(high-pitched)
Wait wait wait

Kurt stops

KURT
The hell’s wrong with your voice

MARK
(extra deep)
Nothing I just
(normal)
I just think we should maybe stick
together Have each other’s back

KURT
Are you scared

MARK
No I mean We just don’t know who’s
out there

KURT

Pound for pound you’re the biggest
hardest hitting mofo in a fifty mile
radius whoever’s out there is gonna be
more scared of you than you will be of
them

Silence hangs in the air for a beat then

MARK
If they’re human
(off Kurt’s expression)
This is just kinda how horror movies
start Two guys split up in the woods
then BAM the monster kills one of them
You know

KURT
But by that logic I’d be the one who gets
killed because the black guy always dies
first

MARK
(relaxes and smiles)
Oh yeah thanks That makes me feel a lot
better

KURT
Way to have my back asshole

With that Kurt shakes his head then takes off Mark watches
him go for a beat then shrugs his shoulders and heads in the
opposite direction

The camera pans to where Bridget lies in the leaves She

waits a beat until she’s sure the boys are gone and then gets
up brushes the leaves off and turns to look behind her where

A GIRL in a Westlake High Cheerleader uniform RUNS across the
woods

The GIRL stops suddenly turns and GLARES AT BRIDGET
Bridget frozen gapes back at AMY BRACKEN

Heart racing confused frightened Bridget turns and
continues to RUN in the opposite direction

EXT WOODS - SAME

Mark HEARS SOMEONE RUN BEHIND HIM He looks back but no one’s
there He looks to his left and right He can’t see what or

who but he hears something

He slows down looks around cautious Mark’s just gone from
predator to prey

MARK
Kurt Yo Come on this isn’t funny

TREES RUSTLE nearby THEN the wind blows Mark looks over
but doesn’t head in the direction of the noise

He backs up in the other direction

Becoming increasingly frightened he turns to run back and
when he does -

SPLAT A THICK STICK IS SHOVED SO DEEP INTO HIS MOUTH that it
juts out the back of his throat

On Mark -- the pain and shock are so intense that he barely
cries out and just doubles over That’s when his feet are

pulled out from under him and he’s dragged downhill

Mark’s dead body lies prostrate at the bottom of a ravine

EXT WOODS POPULAR’S HANGOUT
Kurt comes back to where the girls are

KURT
Where’s Mark

VANESSA
Isn’t he with you

Kurt pulls out his phone texts Mark

BETH

VANESSA

Kurt checks his phone Nothing from Mark

He kisses her more pulls off her shirt He undoes her bra

She wraps her legs around his waist and he carries her over
to a couch lays down so that she’s on top of him They more

EXT STREET - LATE AFTERNOONEARLY EVENING

The sky darkens further as Bridget nears her house

She trudges through an upper-middle-class suburb full of four
and five-bedroom houses then out onto a two-lane

neighborhood street that was a dirt road fifteen years ago

She heads towards the oldest house for miles

EXT BRIDGET’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The Bate’s house wouldn’t be too far off as a comparison
Built in the early 1900’s when the land all around the house
was farmland and the nearest neighbor was five miles away
the house is now either a blight on the neighborhood or a
charming reminder of a time long gone by depending on your
perspective

There are still six semi-unkept acres around the house that
are devoted to a few horses cows and a chicken coop

Several dogs and cats also roam the fenced-in property

Bridget heads into the -

INT BARN - CONTINUOUS

happy to see her Bridget pets him gives him a hug

She’s half-way up when the voice of her mother calls out -

Get down here

Bridget slowly makes her way back down the stairs

INT FAMILY ROOM

Bridget’s mother GERALDINE “GERRY” VANCE 40 eighty pounds
overweight sits on the couch in front of a decade-old TV
which she mutes when she sees Bridget Gerry’s wearing a worn
nightgown that she purchased on sale at JC Penny eight
years ago Her blonde hair is in a short lady-do and her dark
roots are an inch long

Shes eating scalloped potatoes and meatloaf off of a plastic
dish which sits on the coffee table in front of the couch
like a human trough

She looks Bridget up-and-down with a critical eye

GERRY

GERRY
You do and you better be home right after
your shift And I mean RIGHT after If

job goodbye

BRIDGET
Why can’t I just take the car You never
go anywhere after work

Gerry ignores her Bridget goes into the kitchen which is
within earshot of the living room grabs some leftover
spaghetti from the refrigerator nukes it

GERRY

at Bridget

GERRY

BRIDGET

GERRY
No I need to get my robe on Get down

Bridget slowly comes down the stairs Gerry goes upstairs
out of sight

Bridget goes to the door

INT VANCE HOUSE - NIGHT
Bridget opens the door slightly sees her nightmare -

Detective McConnell stands on the dark unlit porch A grey
CAT winds it’s way around his legs meows at him

He tries to peer through the cracked front door

DETECTIVE MCCONNELL
Hello Bridget

He can hardly see her -- she’s backlit and he’s in the dark
The cat attempts to run in -- she stomps her foot blocks it

BRIDGET (CONT’D)
(to cat)
No Psshht Go away Clive (to McConnell
re cat) He claws up the furniture

DETECTIVE MCCONNELL
Your parents home

BRIDGET
No

The door is RIPPED OPEN by Gerry shrouded in a long pink
robe

GERRY
Can I help you

DETECTIVE MCCONNELL
Id like to ask Bridget a few questions
about something that happened at the
school today Would you mind turning a
light on out here or could I come inside

GERRY
The light’s broke And no you can’t come
inside I want to see some kind of
identification

McConnell takes out his badge holds it up

DETECTIVE MCCONNELL
Ma’am if you don’t let me question your
daughter here it will be necessary for
me to take her down to the station A
whole lot of trouble will be caused or
she could just answer a few questions

Gerry flips on the light in the foyer opens the door

McConnell steps inside appraises the shabby but clean house
disapprovingly

He takes out a notepad turns his attention to Bridget

DETECTIVE MCCONNELL (CONT’D)
What happened between you and Jeff
Williams today

Gerrys eyes go wide

BRIDGET
I was in PE class jogging around the
football field and he said there was a
wasp around my head and he made me run
over to where there was a a dead
squirrel And I stepped on it

GERRY
What What was a dead squirrel doing on
the football field

DETECTIVE MCCONNELL
(to Gerry)
Excuse me please(to Bridget) And then
what happened

BRIDGET
I cleaned off my shoes and took a shower

DETECTIVE MCCONNELL
And then

BRIDGET
I went to the nurse’s office

DETECTIVE MCCONNELL
What was wrong with you

BRIDGET
I didn’t feel well (embarrassed) I had
cramps

DETECTIVE MCCONNELL
Why did Jeff single you out Out of all
the other girls he could have chosen he
chose to do that to you Why

BRIDGET
I don’t know (thinks) He doesn’t like
me

DETECTIVE MCCONNELL
Did you do something to make him not like
you

BRIDGET
No Not that I can think of

GERRY
The kid sounds like an asshole It-

DETECTIVE MCCONNELL
Excuse me Ms Vance Jeff Williams is in
a coma at County General

She doesn’t know what to say about that but her face says the
kid still sounds like an asshole

DETECTIVE MCCONNELL (CONT’D)
Were you mad after you went back to the
girl’s locker room

BRIDGET
I was upset It wasawful

DETECTIVE MCCONNELL
Did you want to get back at him

Gerry sees where this is going but remains quiet

BRIDGET
I don’t know I-

DETECTIVE MCCONNELL
Did you go into the boy’s locker room
after you showered Coach Jenny says you
left before all the other girls

Bridget’s knees feel like they’re going to buckle

BRIDGET
I did I mean I did leave the locker room
early but no I didn’t go into the boy’s
locker room

Bridget is about to say something else when -

GERRY
That’s it Arrest her or get out

DETECTIVE MCCONNELL
Just a few more questions

GERRY
I said get out or I’m calling 911 and my
lawyer I know my rights Either you’re
going to arrest her for doing something
to this kid or not Bridget go upstairs

Bridget is frozen

GERRY (CONT’D)
Bridget

Bridget comes to her senses dashes upstairs

McConnell looks around the outdated house as if it were an
admonishment to Gerry’s parenting skills

DETECTIVE MCCONNELL
(threatening)
I talked to Principal Keller this
afternoon She says Bridget misses a lot
of school

Gerry doesn’t give a rat’s ass what this arrogant prick
thinks Before she can reply -

McConnell’s Blackberry buzzes He steps aside answers
MCCONNELL
This is McConnell () When () I’11l
be right there

He hangs up is now in a hurry to leave

DETECTIVE MCCONNELL (CONT’D)
I’m going to have more questions for
Bridget In the meantime might be a good
idea to send a social worker over here

GERRY
You do that You do it Good night

Gerry practically hits him with the door as she closes it
She walks over to the bottom of the stairs flicks on the
light

GERRY
You up there

Bridget comes into view

BRIDGET
Yeah Mom you know I didn’t -

GERRY
Of course you didn’t do anything But you
better pray to Jehovah that that jerk
finds someone else to harass My
meatloaf’s probably cold now

INT BRIDGET’S BEDROOM —- NIGHT

Lit only by a desklamp and her laptop screen the only thing
this room has going for it is a substantial bookshelf

There are no family photos or pictures of Bridget with
friends anywhere in the room

The bed is twin size on the floor and has lots of pillows
so that it also doubles as a couch

Bridget is on Facebook looking at pictures of the popular
kids who were just talking shit about her in the woods There
are pictures from the previous school year that include Amy
Bracken with Vanessa Amy with Beth and Jeff Amy and Vanessa
with Mark standing in between them with his arms around both
of them

Bridget pauses on a photo of Jeff wearing jeans and a t-
shirt laughing like he doesn’t have a care in the world
EXT WOODS - NIGHT

YELLOW POLICE TAPE marks off a perimeter under FLOODLIGHTS

Detectives McConnell and Foster look down at the thick stick
jutting out of Mark’s neck

FOSTER
Dog got loose from the neighborhood
Owner chased him here which is
technically Westlake High School
property Kid’s name is Mark Lopez His
phone and wallet are still on him We got
a hold of a friend Kurt who texted him
wondering where he was Kurt said they
were chasing someone they thought was
spying on them They thought it may have
been Bridget Vance but he couldn’t say
for sure Didn’t get a good enough look

MCCONNELL
I just came from questioning Bridget She
would have to have done it gone right
home and answered the door She didn’t
appear to have struggled with anyone But
her clothes did seem a little disheveled
now that I think about it

FOSTER
Id say this kid is 6’4 about two-fifty
He was dragged a good ten yards Whoever
did this was big Strong
McConnell looks at the hill Mark was dragged down and then
around the darkened woods

something up after what happened to Jeff
AND Mark yesterday

BRIDGET
(whispers)
I took the shortcut through the woods
after school Stephen I swear I saw Amy
Bracken She looked right at me

STEPHEN
Did you tell the detective guy

BRIDGET
No I didn’t think he would believe me I
think he was trying to blame me for Jeff
and if I had told him I was in the
woods

STEPHEN
There’s no way you could have taken out
two football players

(MORE )

STEPHEN (contd)

I mean don’t get me wrong you’re bitter
and jaded enough but you have like zero
upper-body strength Just show the police
your arms

BRIDGET
Well then I guess you wouldn’t be a
suspect either What if it was her

What if she’s out there and has gone
crazy or something

Bridget thinks cuts

STEPHEN (CONT’D)
Don’t go Nancy Drew on this

BRIDGET
I feel like if I don’t figure out what’s
going on that frat guy detective is
going to try to pin it all on me Or at
least keep harassing me which will drive
my mother insane

STEPHEN
You mean insane-er I think you’re over-
reacting and maybe you saw Vanessa or
someone and only thought it was Amy

BRIDGET
Maybe (thinks a beat) I need you to
take me somewhere at lunch

lead into the walls

We were friends in the third grade
Remember You liked horses And my
grandma had a few and your dad would
bring you over to ride You were nice

He’s lifeless She runs her finger up his arm gently touches
the bandaged bump where the needle from the IV pierces his
skin

CLOSE ON Bridget’s finger on the needle-bump

BRIDGET (CONT’D)
Im here because I wanted to see ifyou
just fellon your own Or if you saw

She removes her finger looks at his puffy dead-looking
face He BREATHES in and out

She looks over and sees his BACKPACK on the floor Curious
she peaks inside sees his iPhone She reaches in pushes the
button It’s ON She pulls it out goes to his TEXTS

She scrolls down sees AMY BRACKEN

Bridget reads a conversation from June 15th

tube loose that was connected to him

Without moving his neck Jeff looks directly at her with his
big blue eyes

there

STEPHEN
Good goin’

BRIDGET
(confesses)
I looked at his phone

STEPHEN
WHAT

BRIDGET
Okay don’t kill me But back in June he
texted with Amy Bracken about some
pictures It sounded like they were going
to bribe Coach Jenny into making Amy
Cheer Captain instead of Vanessa

STEPHEN
Vanessa dumped Jeff for Kurt You think
it was because he was banging Coach

Jenny
BRIDGET

Did you just say “banging”
STEPHEN

Did I
BRIDGET

What if this has something to do with
what happened to Jeff and Mark Or Amy

STEPHEN
But what does Mark have to do with it

BRIDGET
I don’t know

He starts the car backs out

BRIDGET
I guess we’ll just have to wait and see
what Jeff says when he comes out of a
coma Hopefully he doesn’t think I
pushed him

STEPHEN
Please You just want an excuse to come
back here and see him again Take
advantage of his bedridden condition
because you like him

was there And then a second later the

on a bar of soap that came out of

Bridget slowly leans in and Jeff puts his hand -- arm still
attached to an IV -- on her face and kisses her

And he keeps kissing her until it turns into French kissing
and a total make-out session with Bridget leaning over his
hospital bed

And in the hallway Vanessa watches BEYOND PISSED She pulls
out her phone and SNAPS A PICTURE before she stalks off

Still kissing Jeff takes Bridget’s hand and guides it to his

be the only one who can see me which I
guess is cool But it’s “my friends” that
I’m after

I’m gonna let them have what everyone
knows is the best days of your life high
school while I’m dead

BRIDGET
I don’t think high school is supposed to
be the best days of your life

AMY
Of course you don’t

I don’t know I just can And as long as
I’m here at school I have power and I
can feel myself getting stronger every
day So watch out Creeper

the plug out of the wall

hands

rope around her neck

In one quick movement Jenny’s body is jerked up and she’s
HUNG from the light box

consciousness is a can of hair spray miraculously moving out
of her gym bag to meet a lighter that flies out of her purse
The hair spray is sprayed the lighter lit and -

QUICK CUTS of CREEPY PEOPLE from various YOUTUBE VIDEOS

“There are individuals known as sensitives -- those who can
sense an unearthly presence when it comes near them Some
sensitives may see a presence and at another time only feel
its presence”

“Often this type of activity is created by a negative angry
ghost who is caught on the astral plane”

“Make sure you’re centered or you’ll open yourself up to the
risk of possession Carry a talisman with you at all times”

“Utilize the Light Spiritually protect yourself by
visualizing a bright white Light”

“Sprinkle salt in doorways or around people to protect them”

Bridget JUMPS Gerry has snuck-in so quietly that Bridget
didn’t hear her She stands behind Bridget looking at what’s
on her screen

BRIDGET
Why don’t you knock

GERRY
(serious concerned)
Why are you watching this demonic stuff
BRIDGET
Don’t go getting all freaked-out It’s
just some some research for school

GERRY
They’re teaching you about demons in
school

BRIDGET
It’s notdemonic It’s it’s just about
ghosts

GERRY

There’s no such thing as ghosts There
are demons and you need to pray to
Jehovah if you think one is terrorizing
you

Bridget just looks at her not knowing who’s crazier

GERRY
Well

BRIDGET
I’m not being terrorized by a demon mom

GERRY
But you’ll pray if you are At least say
Jehovah’s name out loud That will make
them go away

BRIDGET
Yes Okay Fine I will

GERRY
I’‘1l pray for you too I pray for you
every day And stop looking at that stuff
online That’s what attracts them Put
that stuff out of your head I don’t want
you ending up like your grandma seeing
people who aren’t there

BRIDGET
Okay I know I won’t

Bridget remembers her grandma gets a sinking feeling
Gerry heads into her bedroom talking the whole time -
GERRY
I’m going to give you this Watchtower

article on ghosts
(MORE)

GERRY (cont d)

It’s nothing but Satan’s tricks and the
further you stay away from that stuff
the better

Gerry returns with a Jehovah’s Witness’s Watchtower Magazine
which is a twenty-page paper magazine Bridget takes it

BRIDGET

Thanks I’1l check it out Will you drive
me to work in an hour

GERRY
Isn’t that a little early

BRIDGET
Yeah I need to pick some stuff up at the
mall first

GERRY
(sighs)
I guess I have no choice

Gerry leaves Bridget goes over to a drawer pulls out a box
opens it

Inside is an old photograph of a five-year-old Bridget
sitting next to her GRANDMA on a couch Bridget is looking at
her Grandma who looks away as if at something Bridget can’t
see

Also in the box is a gold NECKLACE with a SMALL ROUND
MEDALLION on it Camera pans to the picture where we notice
Grandma wears this necklace

Bridget puts the necklace on She sits down cross-legged and
closes her eyes

WHAT BRIDGET IMAGINES The whole room is covered in a bright
white light that desaturates everything

On Bridget Nothing has changed She’s just sitting with her
eyes closed

WHAT BRIDGET IMAGINES The light becomes brighter A white
light shoots out of her third eye

On Bridget A glimmer of a white light slowly covers her
Bridget opens her eyes The light stays with her She stands
up as if in a trance concentrating A NOISE comes from
downstairs and Bridget loses her concentration The light
quickly fades

INT HOSPITAL — DAY

Bridget apprehensive nervous giddy enters Jeffs room He
sits cross-legged in bed engrossed in something on his iPad
He looks markedly better

you’re doing before I went to work

JEFF
(slightly uncomfortable)
Oh hey I heard about the fire And
Coach Jenny It’s horrible

Bridget senses something’s off with Jeff

BRIDGET
Yeah It was really scary Did youlike
Coach Jenny

JEFF
She was okay I guess

Knowing what she knows Bridget waits for more Jeff doesn’t
offer anything After an excruciating pause -

JEFF
Listen about beforeI really need to
focus on a full recovery and getting back
into the game

Bridget feels a knife going into her -

BRIDGET
Oh So

JEFF
I probably shouldn’t really hang out with
you I mean things are good between us
it’s just you know

Bridget is gutted

BRIDGET
Yeah sure

Bridget feels herself turning to stone Any gushy-sweet
feelings she had for Jeff two minutes ago are swiftly locked
in a box in the far recesses of her head
Jeff is

Jeff is

JEFF
Thanks for coming by to see me I go home
tomorrow so -

BRIDGET
I get it I’1ll leave you alone

JEFF
I didn’t mean it like that I just meant -

BRIDGET
(cold dead)
Whatever I just wanted to warn you I
saw Amy Bracken At school

JEFF
What do you mean

BRIDGET
(matter-of-fact)
She killed Mark and Beth I think she
killed Coach Jenny Amy’s a ghost
Someone killed her

floored

BRIDGET
I know I sound totally crazy but it’s the
truth I saw her at school before it was
set on fire I think I’m a ‘sensitive’
someone who can see ghosts

JEFF
(you’re crazy but -)
Ooooookay Why would Amy kill her
friends

BRIDGET
She seems really mad at everyone She
said you were all “two-faced liars”
I think she’s also really pissed off
about being dead

speechless

BRIDGET
I don’t think she has any power beyond
the school for some reason I’ve been
researching ghosts and I emailed a ghost
hunter for advice I don’t know what’s
going to happen or how I can make her go
away or whatever I just wanted to warn
you I have to go to work

Bridget walks out her face the definition of pain

INT MALL BOOKSTORE —- DAY

About three CUSTOMERS browse the half-empty shelves Jasmine
is in her usual spot but now reading People

Bridget sits across from her sulking half-reading a book
entitled “Real Life Ghost Hunters”

JASMINE
That’s what you get for messing around
with a jock They have “asshole”
engineered into their DNA

Bridget just shakes her head

JASMINE
What are you reading about

BRIDGET
Ghosts It says in here that ghosts “can
move objects around” and that “the
stronger the ghost the more powers they
have to interfere with the living”

JASMINE
My uncle had a ghost in this old house
they lived in out in Farmington They
thought it was in the baby’s room and
that the baby my cousin Tina could see
it One night my uncle found Tina who
could only crawl walking around the
house

BRIDGET
What did they do

JASMINE
They moved

Bridget flips to another chapter
BRIDGET
It says “ghost possession is likely to
occur in people who are depressed or
otherwise distraught”

Jasmine shrugs

JASMINE
The baby was probably upset Hungry or
something and the ghost slipped right in
there

Bridget looks up sees Stephen at the front of the store She
puts her book down goes over to him

STEPHEN
Hey I got your message What’s up

BRIDGET
We haven’t talked in like two days

Foster stops in the doorway

FOSTER
Forensics found pictures of Coach Jenny
and Jeff Williams on her computer I got
a warrant to search her house Tomorrow
morning good for you

MCCONNELL
Yep

FOSTER
Looks like she and Jeff were definitely
having some kind of inappropriate
relationship

MCCONNELL
You think she pushed him in the shower

FOSTER
Could have been angry at him for
something Or maybe he was going to tell
on her Thought she’d kill him to shut
him up Who knows I checked and he was
definitely in the hospital when she was
killed

MCCONNELL
So it still doesn’t add up

FOSTER
No And I’m sure his parents are going to
lawyer-up for any questioning

VANESSA
Do you really think that Jeff Williams

BRIDGET
Youre just jealous because Jeff doesn’t
want you back because you’re boring and
shallow And if you didn’t know it now

to Bridget that keeps her at bay

Bridget

looks to Stephen for support but he looks away

BRIDGET
Stephen Will you take me home

Wishing she would just go away -

STEPHEN
I just got here

Like a robot programmed to walk away Bridget turns and walks
straight out of the party and into the rain

EXT PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT

Wobbly from drinking Kurt comes off of the porch and into
the rain pulls his hoodie over his head He staggers across
the front lawn onto the lawn of the dark empty house next
door He sees someone coming towards him in the darkness

KURT
Hey Who is that

No answer

KURT
Yo

The person gets closer They’re smaller than Kurt so he’s not
too worried but still a little anxious as well as pissed
because whoever the fuck it is they’re not identifying
themselves

Finally Bridget comes into view She’s upset winded

KURT
Why didn’t you say who you were Are you
trying to live up to being a Creeper or
somethin’

BRIDGET
No Don’t call me that I wasn’t sure who
you were

Kurt relaxes but not in a comforting way He gestures to the
porch on the abandoned house

KURT
Come over here for a sec out of this
rain

BRIDGET

I can’t I’m going back to the party
He takes her by the arm He’s twice her size

KURT
They don’t want you in there Trust me on
this one

He’s trying to keep it light-hearted as he guides her over to
the dark porch under the awning There’s no door in the
front doorway just a black hole

BRIDGET
Let me go I need to go back to the
party

KURT

Just give me one minute to charm you I
can be VERY charming I promise

BRIDGET
(sarcastic)
I’m sure you’re a real awesome guy but I

He puts his big hand all over her chest accidently RIPS OFF
HER NECKLACE which falls to the ground Bridget sees the
necklace fall goes to get it but Kurt pulls her into the
dark house

And now we’re SEEING THE WORLD THROUGH AMY’S EYES IN AWESOME
FULL-COLOR NIGHT-VISION

AMY POV Amy can see everything in the room crystal clear
and in vivid color even though it’s dark Visually it’s
remarkable disturbing

Amy sees Kurt overpowering Bridget groping her the twisted
look on Bridget’s face

Amy moves lightening fast towards Bridget goes INTO
BRIDGET’S BODY

Once inside Bridget possessing her Amy’s looking at Kurt
through Bridget’s eyes He has both hands on Bridget’s arms
and is trying to kiss Bridget’s neck His body is thrust up
against Bridget’s pinning her

All of the sudden Bridget’s body language changes She goes
from rigid and resisting to relaxed and welcoming

BRIDGET
(Amys voice)
Mmmm I forgot what a big guy you are

The hairs on the back of Kurt’s neck stand up He loosens his
grip on Bridget

KURT
(wtf)

BRIDGET
(Amys voice)
Remember when we stole that beer from CVS
and then had sex in your dad’s Range
Rover

All of the sudden BOARDS and NAILS start flying around the
room It’s chaos

BRIDGET
(Amys voice)
So sweet that you remember

He steps away from her sober now alert scared and shocked
by the flying nails and boards He’s about to ESCAPE when -

A LONG NAIL stabs him in the arm

KURT
Owe Oh shit

And then ANOTHER NAIL to the leg He tries to get away but
MORE NAILS attack him One-by-one the NAILS FLY INTO KURT and
he’s NAILED TO THE WALL in a hundred different places

The pain is palpable until the LAST ONE 6 INCHES LONG zips
THROUGH HIS HEART killing him

puts his phone away

STEPHEN

VANESSA

EXT PT CRUISER - SAME

We’re with AMY as she FLIES over the car twisting mid-air
and going from window-to-window not getting wet

WE SEE the car below and the nighttime suburban world around
it from Amy’s POV - extreme wide angle almost fisheye vivid
colors

WE HEAR the distant-sounding but audible echo-ey way she
hears Stephen and Vanessa

EXT PARTY HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Police lights flash and an ambulance and fire truck sit idle
McConnell and Foster get a statement from Bridget

MCCONNELL
How long were you gone before you came
back to the party

BRIDGET
(shaken)
Not long I walked to the front of the
sub and it started raining harder I got
nervous so I came back

MCCONNELL
Why didn’t you call your mother right
away

BRIDGET

I knew I’d be in big trouble if she had
to come and get me I thought if I asked
Stephen again he would give me a ride

MCCONNELL
And when you got back

BRIDGET
I couldn’t find him He still hasn’t
texted me back

MCCONNELL
Wouldn’t he have seen you walking through
the subdivision

BRIDGET

skittish bird

VANESSA

music

STEPHEN
(now subconscious with
mouthful of burger)
It’s ‘The Kills’ Do you like it

He turns the heat up and the music down starts scrolling
through his iPod

STEPHEN
What do you want to listen to

VANESSA
I don’t care I usually listen to
whatever’s on the radio

He nods This is so not the awesome time he was hoping for
VANESSA

I can’t believe they’re going to have
school on Monday after the fire

STEPHEN
Yeah (beat) Sorry about Coach Jenny
VANESSA
Yeah it’s really sad Do you have any
Rhianna
STEPHEN
I think so

He puts on “WE FOUND LOVE” looks miserable

The HEAT goes up FULL BLAST Stephen tries to turn it down
but can’t

VANESSA
Wow that’s hot

Even though it’s raining she goes to roll down the window
but it won’t go down

VANESSA
Is there something wrong with your car

STEPHEN
No I don’t know what’s going on

The windows quickly FOG UP Both look at the fogged
windshield as “YOU’RE NEXT CHEER CAPTAIN” is written

VANESSA
What the

She goes to open her door to escape the car but the DOORS
LOCK Stephen tries his door same thing

Stephen tries turn the car off he pulls the key out but the
car is still running

STEPHEN
I can’t turn it off

And then a RIPPING SOUND

VANESSA
What’s that

The FLOOR IS BEING RIPPED OFF of the car They both look down
in horror as the floor of the car is SLOWLY LOUDLY EERILY
PEELED OFF

In fight-or-flight mode Vanessa SCRAMBLES over the seats to
the back of the car tries frantically to get out the back
door She KICKS the back window with both feet The window
starts to CRACK but then -

The car is THROWN INTO REVERSE and THE GAS PEDAL GOES DOWN
Going backwards the car picks-up speed

VANESSA
(shrieks )
What are you doing
STEPHEN
I’m not doing anything It’sthe car or
something
The car is going backwards faster 40 50 mph
Vanessa looks out the window as -

THE CAR PLOWS BACKWARDS TOWARDS THE SCHOOL

She now hurries to get to the front of the car climbing over
the seats jumping into the front seat as -

THE CAR CRASHES INTO THE SCHOOL

Stephen’s HEAD SLAMS into the steering wheel as the AIRBAGS
BLOW UP everywhere Vanessa is thrown ass first into the
windshield and then -

The car SHIFTS INTO DRIVE and is about to plow into the woods
when the STEERING WHEEL TURNS HARD TO THE LEFT and the car
does a few DONUTS on the wet pavement before-

- it SPINS UP INTO THE AIR

STEPHEN
Oh my God

VANESSA
What’s happening

The roof of the car SMASHES INTO THE LAMPOST knocking out the
light and sending GLASS SPEWING everywhere

The car is now suspended thirty feet in the air and Stephen
and Vanessa are looking down through the non-existent floor

Vanessa SCREAMS grabs onto the roof handle Stephen white
knuckles the steering wheel

Their seats suddenly disappear as the bottom frame of the car
DROPS to the ground below with a heavy CRASH

Both of them DANGLE in the wind and rain Vanessa is more
athletic and manages to get her feet up on the arm rest on
the door Stephen is about to lose his grip of the steering
wheel when the car starts moving forward and then CRASHES
DOWN INTO WOODS

Stephen is thrown from the car and killed instantly

The car rolls flips on it’s side and finally comes to a
stop

The passenger side window is smashed out and Vanessa is
barely alive when she’s DRAGGED semi-conscious out of the
car and over to the rain-drenched parking lot by unseen
hands

WE SEE (but Vanessa doesn’t) Amy drags her

AMY
I know we were Brownies together And we
went to dance and gymnastics together We
even hooked-up with the same boys But
that doesn’t mean that you get my life

Amy stops let’s Vanessa go Vanessa has no idea what’s going
on but instinctively tries to CRAWL away

Amy walks along side her unseen (except by us)

AMY
You thought you could replace me as the
most popular girl at Westlake didn’t
you Even when I was alive you were
always scheming against me You stole
Jeff from me and then somehow convinced
Coach Jenny to make you Cheer Captain
You always made things hard for me

Amy leans over close to the bloody struggling Vanessa

AMY
And yet you were my bestie

Amy breaks Vanessa’s neck

WIDE SHOT as rain pours down on the mangled bodies of Vanessa
and the PT Cruiser

newspaper with the gruesome DETAILS Kurt’s MURDER

On another page are details about Stephen’s CAR CRASH We see
the words “MARIJUANA MIGHT HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN PUZZLING
CRASH”

Bridget blows her nose She crawls off of the bed sits on
the floor with her legs crossed She touches her
grandmother’s necklace (now fixed) and closes her eyes
Bridget concentrates

She sits perfectly still takes DEEP BREATHS

CLOSE ON Bridget’s face relaxes becomes calm

A bright white light slowly envelopes Bridget The light is
strongest on her temple her third eye

A calm slight smile comes over her mouth

Bridget slowly opens her eyes the light is still around her
She stands up the light moves with her

help

McConnell leans back in his chair at his wit’s end

MCCONNELL
Let’s see if we get a match on DNA found
on either Coach Jenny or Kurt first

FOSTER
You still thinking about Bridget Vance

MCCONNELL
Despite the size of the boys I still
haven’t ruled it out She says she wasn’t
in the woods when Mark was killed but the
kids think they saw her She was made fun
of by Jeff the day he was pushed in the
shower She was at the party last night
but left and came back She doesn’t fit
the physical profile but if she was
working with someone else I don’t know

FOSTER
Her only friend seems to be Stephen
Weintraub also now dead
They look at each other for a beat
MCCONNELL

We have to handle this delicately but I
want to keep an eye on Bridget Vance

JEFF
All of them
BRIDGET

What did you want to talk about

JEFF
I believe you About Amy And you said
something about getting rid of her Do
you think you can do that ‘Cause I’m
afraid to go back to school

BRIDGET
Yeah I think I know how to get rid of
her I need to find out who killed her
and where she’s buried It must be
somewhere at school

JEFF
What makes you think that

BRIDGET
She seemstied there somehow

JEFF
But what about Kurt

Bridget thinks back to the night before to the party and
what she remembers before she passed out

BRIDGET
I think Amy’s getting stronger I don’t
know how shekilled Kurt

JEFF
So what’s next

BRIDGET
I’m going to find out how she died And
then I need to get her spirit to the
other side to the spirit world I need
to make sure her body gets a proper
funeral so that her soul has closure with
the dimension of the living If I can do
all of that Amy will be laid to rest and
won’t haunt Westlake High School anymore

JEFF
But if she can kill people why wouldn’t
she kill you

BRIDGET
I can see her and I know how to protect
myself I’m gonna go to the school find
her and talk to her try to get her to go
to the other side on her own but force
her if she won’t go

JEFF
How are you going to force Amy

BRIDGET
I’ve read how to do it and this woman a
ghost hunter emailed me I feel strong
enough especially because of Stephen I
need to do this for him

JEFF
It seems really dangerous

BRIDGET
Amy has no reason to hate me I just have
to stay calm and let my positivity banish
her negativity

JEFF
No offence but your positivity

BRIDGET
I’m positive If you knew me better you
would know that but you or your friends
never really gave me a chance

Both are surprised that Bridget is sticking up for herself to
Jeff

JEFF
You’re right I’m sorry Do you want
someone to go with you

BRIDGET
No You couldn’t see her anyway and she
tried to kill you once already so

JEFF
Good point Stillit doesn’t seem safe
Remotely

one of the desk legs nails her shoulder It’s PAINFUL and

the globe pegs her in the forehead causing a huge gash which
starts to BLEED

imagines the white light around her protecting her but she
has trouble concentrating as she runs down the hall

Amy stands in front of her

But something stops Amy she can’t get closer than a foot
away from Bridget

A bright white aura now surrounds Bridget

Feeling weightless Bridget focuses all of her energy on Amy
The white light expands travels towards Amy envelopes her

changes her mind

Amy takes all of her energy and tries to get out of Bridget’s
white light She nearly succeeds is inches from clawing
Bridget’s eyes out Bridget focuses harder sweat coming down
her forehead

Bridget doesn’t see him but JEFF is peeking around the
corner watching He CAN SEE what’s happening

Piece by piece Amy’s ‘body’ breaks apart and FLIES back into
another dimension First an arm then a leg another leg the
bottom half of her torso

AMY
Stop Stoppit Let me go you stupid
loser

Bridget concentrates harder and Amy’s head EXPLODES reels
back into the white light Finally there’s nothing left of
Amy Bracken

The white light that was around Amy fades Bridget’s aura
also fades and she collapses onto the floor

Jeff runs over to her She looks up at him weak and
frightened

JEFF

I knew Amy was dead I had to see if you
were right about Amy’s ghost ‘cause I
