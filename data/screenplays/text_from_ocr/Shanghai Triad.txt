BO) 05 S03 Sap Si 97S AE in RS we or nn aEEREEEEEEEEEEE

RAIN

1 A horde of passengers is disembarking from a ferry-boat Hundreds of faces
Luggage of different shapes and sizes Multi-coloured umbrellas

2 Shui Sheng a youth arriving from the country is completely lost in the
throng Carrying a small case in his hand he is swept forward by the crowd
descending from the boat

3 As he walks down the gang-plank Shui Sheng catches glimpses of the
buildings of the Shanghai Bund of the 1930s over the drenched backs and
dripping umbrellas of the passengers

4 Shui Sheng scans the waiting crowd looking for his uncle his eves
nervously flitting from face to face

5 The rain pours down on the huge buildings which rise up over the top of
the scrum of umbrellas

6 Shui Sheng is both excited and nervous He stands up on tiptoe to stare at
these huge building unlike anything out in the country

7 An umbrella bursts open in front of him completely blocking his vision

SCENE 2 EXTLATE AFTERNOON ROADNEARTHE PORT
LIGHTRAIN

1 Shui Sheng pulls his jacket over his head to protect him from the rain He
looks lost and continues to scan the quaysside for signs of his uncle

2 Gradually the huge crowd drifts away Only puddles are left reflecting the
grey sky

3 Shui Sheng clutching a bundle to his chest props himself up against
telegraph pole His case is at his feet on the wet pavement The rickshaws
scurry past Shui Sheng looks up and stares at the electric cables spinning out
from the top of the pole

The camera follows his gaze
5 Shui Sheng hears his name being called

6 A heavily laden lorry skids to a halt in front of him Three men in western-
style suits are squeezed into the cabin A middle-aged man opens the door and
jumps down

7 Shui Sheng recognises the man and calls to him timidly

SHUI SHENG
Liu Shu
(Liu Shu is Shui Shengs uncle He is the Triads
number Six)

8 Liu Shu heads over to Shui Sheng and slaps him affectionately on the cheek

LIU SHU

(loudly)
There you are Youve grown How is your
father

SHUI SHENG
Very well

LIU SHU
And your mother

SHUI SHENG
Shes well also

LIU SHU

Im late I was scared you might have got lost

SHUI SHENG
My mother told me to wait for you by a
telegraph pole if you werent here when the
boat docked And not to move

LIU SHU

(smiling)
Quite right Shanghai is very different from the
provinces It can be dangerous if you get lost

nN
Liu Shu leans forward to pick up the case nods towards the lorry and says to
his nephew

LIU SHU
Get in the back and hold on Im going to take
you for a ride around Shanghai

SCENE 3 EXTEVENING RUE DE SHANGHAI RAIN

1 The streetlights have come on Like magical mirrors the puddles in the road
reflect the buildings which recede as Shui Sheng hurties backwards down the
street

(4 series of shots from the childs viewpoint In the 1930s motor vehicles
could move very quickly through the streets of Shanghai)

2 Shui Sheng sees different colours whirling around him

3 He is sitting on piles of sacks in the back of the lorry looking constantly
from left to right He holds a waterproof cloth over his head to protect him
from the rain and with the other hand clings to the side-rail so as not to fall
out

4 The neon lights blur as the lorry speeds past

5 Shui Sheng opens his eyes wide with delight The wind whistles around his
ears his head switches from side to side like a mechanical toy taking in the
many different colours and noises of the chaotic city

SCENE 4 EXTZEVENING WAREHOUSERAIN

Deen eee ee eee ee eee eee eee ema ERR

1 The lorry draws to a halt in the shadows at the rivers edge The motor cuts
out taking with it the city’s brouhaha

2 The lorry has stopped in front of the large wooden door of a warehouse The
honking of the lorrys horn penetrates the silence

3 The bloated face of a shaven-headed man appears through a small opening
in the door

4 Liu Shu leans out of the lorry and gives a strange signal to the man
- 3
5 With a loud creaking of its hinges the wooden door sw ings inwards The -
steel cable holding the door uncoils noisily

The dark entry of the warehouse appears like a gaping mouth ready to eat the
lorry Footsteps ring out hollowly giving the impression that the warehouse is
very large and empty Two groups of men dressed in black appear on both
sides of the door

6 Liu Shu moves towards the door flanked by two of his men His expression
is very serious and he is clearly on his guard with one hand stuffed firmly in
his pocket He walks into the warehouse itself followed by his two acolytes
each with a hand in his pocket also

7 From the back of the lorry Shui Sheng looks on curiously The rain has
stopped

8 He catches sight of another group of men in the warehouse all standing in
the same way legs apart and one hand in a trouser pocket

In the middle of the group Liu Shu is in whispered discussion with the
shaven-headed man who looks up and glances over at the lorry

9 Bundles of empty sacks fall one after the other to the ground

10 The shaven-headed man along with some of the black-clothed men are
kicking these bundles hastily out of the back of the lorry

11 They unload haif of the lorrys contents in this way to reveal a large trunk

12 They suddenly stop their activity The shaven-headed man makes to lift
the trunk

13 Seeing that the trunk is very heavy Shui Sheng who has been standing
next to the lorry moves forward to help Just then a voice rings out

LIU SHU
(vo - harshly)
Shui Sheng

14 Liu Shu in the shadows of the warehouse is not completely visible The
deathly silence merely amplifies the sound of his voice

15 His shout brings Shui Sheng up short
16 The shaven-headed man pulls the trunk out of the lorry and carries it into
the warehouse The other men form a close circle round the trunk

A man wearing a long Chinese robe emerges from the shadows He bangs on
the trunk with his hand before approaching Liu Shu

They each stretch out their hand link the ring-fingers of their right hands and
shake hands in this way

17 Intrigued Shui Sheng watches the movements of the men in the
warehouse He looks up as he hears the sound of a car arriving

18 A black car crosses the pool of light thrown by a streetlight at the corner of
the warehouse and pulls up in front of the door

19 The car-door opens and a young man in a suit jumps out He walks round
the front of the car and ostentatiously opens the rear door on the passenger
side A man of about thirty vears old wearing a well-cut suit and glasses gets
out His dress makes him look like vaguely professorial but it is clear by his
manner that his importance is not merely paedogological

Liu Shu hurries over to him

LIU SHU
(bowing)
Song Er Ye

20 Song Er Yes sole reply is a nod of the head
‘Together they walk towards the warehouse As they pass in front of Shui
Sheng Song Er Ye pauses

LIU SHU

(hastily)
His name is Shui Sheng The Master himself told
him to come to the city
(turning towards Shui Sheng)
Shui Sheng Come quickly Say hello to Song Er
Ye
SHUI SHENG
Song Er Ye
(In Chinese Song Er Ye alone is considered
polite)

22 Song Er Ye looks Shui Sheng up and down and then without a word he
leads the group into the warehouse

The door is closed on Shui Sheng leaving him alone with the lorry in front of
the warehouse

23 Shui Sheng settles down on the sacks thrown from the lorry Night is
falling the puddles left from the afternoon rain now reflect the moons bright
light

24 Through a crack in the door Shui Sheng observes what is happening inside
the warehouse Thus he sees the shaven-dheaded man force open the trunk
and the man in traditional dress lean forward to inspect its contents

The door has cut off one of the few sources of light in the warehouse forcing
Shui Sheng to peer in to distinguish the shadows

In turn Song Er Ye approaches the trunk the other man straightens up
motions towards Song Er Ye and says something to him while gesticulating

25 Shui Sheng is getting bored He turns away and scans the city sky-line

26 The lights on the huge building of the Bund form a sea of stars both
intriguing and luxurious

As his imagination begins to take him awy over this horizon a deafening
gunshot rings out in the warehouse

27 Shui Sheng turns quickly back to the crack in the door

The shaven-headed man appears to have fallen to one side of the trunk He is
trying to pull himself to his feet

29 Sounds of people running the man in traditional dress and some of his
mob burst out of a side door and head off down the street
30 Shui Sheng is unable to clearly distinguish what is happening inside the
warehouse He can only see Song Er Ye looking still more serious walk slowly
towards the shaven-headed man

The injured man is racked with spasms Shui Sheng hears two more gunshots
and sees his body slump to the floor motionless

31 Shui Sheng surprised by the rapidity and almost game-like simplicity of
all he has witnessed is left gaping

32 Song Er Ye walks towards the door Shui Sheng can see him taking a
carefully folded white handkerchief from his pocket which he shakes open
and uses to thoroughly wipe the barrel of his gun His expression is caim as if
nothing had happened

SCENE 5 EXTEVENING STREET - LORRY

1 Liu Shu his eves hooded over grips the steering-wheel and stares at the
road ahead

Shui Sheng is seated at his side thinking about the events at the warehouse
He risks a sidelong glance at his uncle

SHUI SHENG
Lui Shu what happened earlier

LIU SHU
Its none of vour business Just keep what you
saw to yourself

Shui Sheng dares not speak He watches the electric streetlights through the
cabins window

2 The road is still wet and the lights on both sides rush by like multi-coloured
ribbons

3 Liu Shu lights a cigarette before speaking

LIU SHU
Dont be in such a hurry to help next time
SHUI SHENG
My mother told me that life in the city makes
people lazy They all keep their hands in their
pockets She made me swear not to become lazy
like them

Liu Shus expression darkens even further and he says something whose
meaning escapes Shui Sheng

LIU SHU
Being in a hurry will make you lose your head
one of these days Your mother doesnt
understand these things

Shui Sheng remains silent
Liu Shu exhales noisily
LIU SHU
(more kindly’)
In Shanghai knowing when to help and when
not to when to put your hand in your pocket
and when to take it out is a real art You must
listen to what I tell you And do what I tell you
to do Get it
Shui Sheng nods his head

Just then a clock begins to chime over their heads Shui Sheng leans out of the
window to look

4 The clock-tower recedes from his view chiming seven times in all
5 His curiosity is awakened and he forgets the previous conversation

SHUI SHENG
Liu Shu whats that

LIU SHU
Its a clock Shanghais iron cock

He pulls Shui Sheng back inside the lorrys cabin
LIU SHU
Stop it Even with an eye in the back of your
head you couldnt see all there is to see in
Shanghai All this looking left and right its as if
youve never seen anything
We are both from the Tang clan and if the
master asked me to fetch you here its because
of your name
The Master only trusts the men of our clan The
Tangs are respected throughout Shanghai
Dont be sucha bumpkin You understand

SHUI SHENG
(sagely)
Yes I understand

SCENE 6 EXTEVENING ENTRY TO THE TANG
PROPERTY

1 A tall muscular man dressed in black opens the door to them He
Scrutinises the case Shui Sheng is Carrying

Liu Shu
This is Shui Sheng He has just come up from
the country

The man gives no reply He moves forward to take the case from the boys
grasp

2 As he comes into the light Shui Sheng notices a scar running from right to
left across his face as if it were cut in two

3 He has barely the time to conceal his surprise and the case is already in the
mans hands

4 The man in black adroitly sifts through the case Its contents are made up of
everyday items given to Shui Sheng by his mother just before he left

5 Shui Sheng has hold Of Liu Shu by the back of his jacket which makes his
uncle smile
LIU SHU
This is Master Tangs house Who are you
scared of

SCENE 7 EXTEVENING THE MAIN HOUSE

1 The main building of the residence is a three-storey western-style house
Fiower-pots and indoor plants have been placed along each staircase The lawn
which runs round the house has been planted with plane-trees Through their
leaves the lights of several rooms are visible and illuminate the facade of the
house

The driveway leading up to the front door is lined with black limousines
which appear to be guarded by a number of men dressed in black who pace
up and down

2 Liu Shu leads Shui Sheng towards the building walking over the shadows of
the plane-trees

3 The man and his nephew have their identity checked by the men dressed in
black who recede back into the shadows as soon as they recognise Liu Shu

SCENE 8 INTNIGHT THE TANG PROPERTY

1 Wall-lights and hanging lamps diffuse a peaceful orange light all the way
down a marble corridor Liu Shu leads Shui Sheng towards the stairs at the
‘end of the corridor receiving the greetings of the many servants on the way

2 It is the first time that Shui Sheng has seen a room of such luxury His eves
open wide with astonishment as he treads carefully down the marbie floor
still clinging to Liu Shus jacket His eyes continue to flick from left to right

3 Chinese-style lanterns have been placed against the marble walls each one
defining a coloured space before it Above the staircase wooden lanterns
bearing Chinese characters spell out the words Honest and direct

4 One of the hanging lamps resembles a glowing bush

(suddenly)
Its truly good to have a lot of money

LIU SHU
Have money Its not just that In Shanghai if
someone gives vou a coin our Master will
already have touched it

Shui Sheng passes his case from one hand to the other

SHUI SHENG
How does one get a lot of money

LIU SHU
Everyone who comes to Shanghai asks the same
question How can I earn easy money
It depends you have to obey its word

SHUI SHENG
What Money can talk What language does it
speak

LIU SHU
At the moment its talking a Shanghai dialect

SHUI SHENG

(abruptly)
I want to obey it When I have a lot of money
Ill go back home and open a tofu shop

LIU SHU

(bursting out laughing)
You really are a little peasant When you have a
lot of money you can have anything you want
in Shanghai A tofu shop is nothing

SCENE 9 INTDAY BATHROOM
1 The water gushes down into the bath

2 Shui Shengs head emerges from the water he wipes the water from his
eves and looks around

3 The bathroom is very large filled with whirling clouds of steam which filter
the light

Shui Sheng leans his head against the edge of the bath His hair is plastered
over his eyes making him look slightly ridiculous His face is very close to that
of Liu Shu

Shui Sheng finds this funny He smiles and noticing that Liu Shu is ina good
mood decides to ask him

SHUI SHENG
How is my great-uncle

LIU SHU
(raising his eyebrows)
Your great-uncle Who is your great-uncle

SHUI SHENG
My mother told me I had to call him that

7 Liu Shu gives him a gentle slap

LIU SHU
Youre not in the provinces here This is
Shanghai The Master rules Shanghai even the
foreigners respect him Who do you think you
are to dare call him that

SHUI SHENG
What should I call him then

LIU SHU
You must call him Master Do vou understand

SHUI SHENG
Yes I understand

10 Liu Shu gives a nod of satisfaction and gets to his feet

LIU SHU
I was right to bring vou here Even an idiot can
become intelligent if his name is Tang Let me
soap you down

11 Liu Shu washes Shui Shengs hair which is a completely new experience
for him with soap suds running down his body

LIU SHU
This soap comes from Japan Just one wash will
get rid of all the smells you have been carrying
around
Even the Tang family servants cannot be
allowed to be the laughing-stock of the streets

Shui Sheng wipes the lather from his face

SHUI SHENG
What am I to do for the Master

LIU SHU

(smiling)
You You want to serve the Master You have
to train for many years before even thinking of
that

12 Shui Sheng wipes his face once more and looks up

LIU SHU
You are going to serve a woman
SHUI SHENG
(disappointed)
No I dont want to

LIU SHU

(whispering and smiling)
Its not just any woman Its the Masters
woman He bought her ten vears ago And now
she is the most famous singer in Shanghai

SHUI SHENG
(annoyed)
I dont know how to serve a lady

LIU SHU
Nobodys asking you to become the Master To
be a servant is just a matter of training

SHUI SHENG
I dont want to

LIU SHU
You dont want to Okay then but you cant
change your mind after youve seen her

SHUI SHENG
Who is she

Liu Shu rinses his hands in the water

LIU SHU
Who is she Ive Known her for ten years but
all that know about her is that her name is
Xiao Jin Bao and that she was born in the Year
of the Snake And thats what the Master told
me

14 Liu Shu dips his head into the water then stands up and shakes it
vigourously

LIU SHU
There are many people who want to work for
the Tang family you know To get a job here
you spend a month on trial and only if you get
through that can you really sav you have been
taken on Dont vou want to learn If Ive
managed to get where am today its because
never said no in this house
A young bird doesnt realise how big the forest
is Many people in Shanghai have drowned in
the Huang Bu river and do you know why
Because they dared to utter that word
And you you have managed to say the word
“no” whilst still a boy If I werent here you
wouldnt even be a servant Work well okay

SHUI SHENG
Okay
SCENE 10 EXTNIGHT THE CITY OF PLEASURES
Sn I I YY OF PLEASURES

1 The neon lights flicker in the night all along the road and are reflected
below by the wet street which is bustling with people and cars rushing bv like
beetles whose backs reflect the lights once more The noise of the crowd and
car-horns intermingle

2 The night-club is called The City of Pleasures The characters of its name
are made up of different coloured neon tubes but the constantly changing
colours makes the Chinese characters lose their form

SCENE 11 INTNIGHT THE CITY OF PLEASURES

1 The cabaret is decorated in a gaudy luxurious style It is full of people and
very noisy

Lights and noises mix colouring the smokey atmosphere The music is very
loud On the curved stage a group of tap-dancers are performing

2 Shui Sheng has new clothes and his hair gtistens with a parting in the
middle He follows Liu Shu past several brightly-lit tables The stage in front
both excites and scares him

3 Champagne Ice Ties Watches
4 Westerners Chinese Western suits Chinese tunics
5 Women who burst out laughing Men who dance

6 Shanghai is a word which describes very well the image of the city a
stormy ocean for those who dive into it
(Shan means over and also “to enter Hai means sea Thus Shanghai means
both “Over the sea and Enter the sea)

And in this ocean Liu Shu is proving to be a real life-buoy for Shui Sheng He
holds onto his uncles hand following hesitantly as if he could be swept away
with the merest false step

7 The tap-dancers finish their show to rousing applause

8 Liu Shu selects a table near the stage and orders a whisky for himself and
an ice-cream for Shui Sheng When the order arrives he puts the ice-cream in
front of Shui Sheng and nods to him to eat it The boy takes a mouthful and
puts his hand to his lips surprised by the coldness of it He shyly looks up at
Liu Shu Liu Shu leans back in his chair and smiles kindly at him

9 The musicians come back on stage The drummer skilfully twirls his sticks
around his fingers and the trumpetists start up

The customers become even more animated The curtain draws back to reveal
a dozen girls on stage all wearing very short skirts They begin a wild dance
under flashing lights

10 Shui Sheng is still eating his ice-cream but his eyes open wide at the
spectacle of so many pretty and bouncy girls

11 A woman in a scarlet dress makes her entry provoking shouts and
applause from the audience

12 Just like everybody else Liu Shu smiles and claps He leans over to Shui
Sheng and whispers into his ear

LIU SHU
And that is Xiao Jin Bao

13 Shui Sheng gazes attentively at the stage

14 Xiao Jin Bao walks forward to greet the audience Then she begins to dance
to the rythm of the music throwing seductive smiles into the crowd of
admirers Before the applause has fully abated she approaches the
microphone and starts to sing

XIAO JIN BAO
(singing)
“Hypocrite Hypocrite
Whats the use of being such a hypocrite

If vou have something to say
just sav it

Theres no point stammering
15 The audience applauds at the end of each line and some go down to the
dance-floor They dance imitating the movements of the girls on stage making

the atmosphere increasingly raunchy

16 Liu Shu leans over to Shui Sheng while watching the stage with an
admiring smile

LIU SHU
Have you ever been bitten by a tortoise

Shui Sheng finds it hard to understand what Liu Shu is saying amidst the noise
of the music and the audience He continues to stare at the stage

Lui Shu puts his glass down and in annoyance takes Shui Sheng by the chin
with his right hand and forcibly turns his head towards him

LIU SHU
Have you ever been bitten by a tortoise

Shui Sheng looks at him unsure then turns back to the stage Once more Liu

Shu takes his head and turns it away from the stage At this point Liu Shus
mouth is almost touching Shui Shengs nose

LIU SHU
You really deserve to be bitten by a tortoise
When it bites into you you mustnt move If
you move you show that youre scared and if
voure scared the tortoise just bites harder and
harder
If you can stand the pain control vour fear and
simply look at it theres a good chance the
tortoise will simply let go after a moment

Shui Sheng nods The audience is still shouting and clapping Liu Shu looks
back to the stage with a smile

17 Xiao Jin Bao is still singing accompanying her voice with voluptuous
movements She repeats

XIAO JIN BAO
“Hv pocrite Hypocrite
Whats the use of being such a hypocrite

If ou want to look
just look

Theres no point peeping

18 Liu Shu watches the show out of the corner of one eye with his head
leaning slightly to the left

LIU SHU
When she arrived in Shanghai she was barely
your size and she was even more of a bumpkin
The Master bought her and turned her into a
star for his own pleasure What matters is the
Masters pleasure
And because of her the Master sent his own
wife out into the country Who now would dare
say anything against her
Shes a real whore She thinks that the Master
will always take her side and so she treats all of
us like her servants
She takes herself very seriously

LIU SHU

(cont
When the Master gets rid of her all that will be
left will be the whore
But shes not stupid she doesnt believe what
anybody says not even the Master For her
there is no truth
Here she makes money for the Master and in
bed she allows him to save money
The only thing she knows how to do is to give
the Master pleasure with the help of her two
tofus

SHUI SHENG
So if have my shop one day I could give the
Master tofu to make him even happier

20 Liu Shu turns his head slowly to look at Shui Sheng giving him an odd
smile In a slightly sadistic way he raises the little finger of his clenched hand

LIU SHU
You can keep your tofu for yourself Let her
look after the Master
Incredible

Liu Shu scrutinises Xiao Jin Bao from head to foot

LIU SHU

(to himself)
Shes quite incredible The Master often says
that hes never met a woman like her Shell do
anything for his pleasure

21 Xiao Jin Bao rolls her hips slowly as her seductive eyes roam around the
room offering themselves equally to all the men present

She wears a smile as complex as a poppy flower both seuctive and dangerous
As she ends her song the audience claps and whistles even louder than before
She then disappears graciously behind the curtain

22 Liu Shu tugs at Shui Shengs sleeve

SCENE12 INTNIGHT BACKSTAGE
1 Liu Shu leads Shui Sheng down a long corridor full of dancers
2 Their made-up faces are barely visible in the dim light

3 Yet the faces are so close to his and so strange that Shui Sheng becomes
nervous His steps falter

Liu Shu turns to speak to him
LIU SHU

Remember you only call her Mistress from
now on You are her servant at all times

SCENE 13 INTNIGHT DRESSING ROOM
1 Liu Shu knocks on the wooden door with a curled index finger Even as he
does so he unwittingly bends at the waist Shui Sheng notices this change of

attitude

XIAO JIN BAO
Enter

Liu Shu grasps the door handle turns it and pushes the door open with great
care

SCENE 14 INTNIGHT DRESSING ROOM

1 Once the door is open Shui Sheng sees an old mirror on the wall opposite
and reflected in the mirror he sees Xiao Jin Bao lying nonchalantly on a couch
She has her legs resting on the dressing table and between them a pack of
cigarettes and a golden lighter

She yanks the golden combs from her hair and throws them against the
mirror

2 With a metallic chink the combs bounce back off the mirror and fall onto
the table

3 Liu Shu nudges Shui Sheng and whispers to him

LIU SHU
Say heilo to your mistress

SHUI SHENG
Mistress

Xiao Jin Bao doesn’t reply She is staring via the mirror at a dresser standing
near the door

XIAO JIN BAO
(to the dresser)
Come closer

The dresser holding her crossed palms to her stomach comes to stand in front
of the singer

5 Xiao Jin Bao turns to look at her

XIAO JIN BAO
Turn round

The dresser mechanically turns her back to Xiao Jin Bao She seems very tense

XIAO JIN BAO
(lightly stroking the dressers behind)
Mmm not bad I can see why all the clients
want to paw you

The dresser turns back to face Xiao Jin Bao she is flustered

XIAO JIN BAO

(smiling)
At least you didnt let them get away with it
for nothing eh

Xiao Jin Bao briskly thrusts her hand into the girls cleavage and brings out a

silver coin She stares directly into the girls eyes which are beginning to
resemble those of a cowering cat

XIAO JIN BAO
You thought you could hide it eh Wherever
vou Stash it away Ill always find it

The dresser is no longer able to speak
Xiao Jin Bao slaps her on the behind with the silver coin

XIAO JIN BAO
Listen to what Im going to say Your bottom
belongs to you but this is my house so what
the clients give vou for touching it is mine
Thats the rule

THE DRESSER
(almost in tears)
Yes mistress

10 Xiao Jin Bao smiles once more and slips the coin back into the girls
cleavage

XIAO JIN BAO
Just this once you can keep the money

THE DRESSER
(hastily - joyfully)
Yes mistress

11 Xiao Jin Bao turns and looks at herseif in the mirror As she does so the
smile seeps from her face

XIAO JIN BAO
but rules are rules I cant strectch them for
you ll dock it from your pay Just so that you
remember You may go

12 The Dresser leaves

13 Xiao Jin Bao serves herself a glass of wine and looks at Shui Sheng through
the mirror It is a very icy stare
XIAO JIN BAO
(to herself)
This time theyve sent me a voung cock

14 Liu Shu pushes Shui Sheng in the back forcing him forward somewhat
reluctantly he comes to a halt behind Xiao Jin Bao who is still Standing in
front of the mirror Reflected in the mirror we now see Shui Shengs face next
to that of Xiao Jin Bao

15 Without turning round Xiao Jin Bao stretches her hand out to Shui Shengs
neck Her hand is cold making Shui Sheng hunch up his shoulders

Xiao Jin Bao squeezes Shui Shengs neck He remains completely frozen as she
places her thumb on his throat

She looks at him in the mirror

XIAO JIN BAO
How old are you thirteen or fourteen

LIU SHU
(replying for Shui Sheng)
Fourteen

Xiao Jin Bao looks intensely at Shui Sheng

XIAO JIN BAO
(pensively)
Fourteen
Have vou ever slept with a woman

LIU SHU
(tense)
Miss

SHUI SHENG
(unhesitatingly)
Yes

XIAO JIN BAO
(bringing her head level with Shui Shengs
and whispering)
Who with
SHUI SHENG
With my mother when I was little

XIAO JIN BAO
Ah with your mother when vou were little
Whats your name

LIU SHU
(hastily)
Shui Sheng

XIAO JIN BAO
And vour surname

She spins round to face Liu Shu

XIAO JIN BAO
Let him answer for himself

SHUI SHENG
(swallowing hard)
Tang My name is Tang

XIAO JIN BAO -
(deliberately)
T-a-n-g

She holds her expression for a moment mouth open then quickly stands
straight

XIAO JIN BAO
I like him

19 Slyly Liu Shu gives a sigh of relief
20 Xiao Jin Bao takes the packet of cigarettes and her lighter and sits down
XIAO JIN BAO

(kindly)
Could you light me a cigarette

21 Shui Sheng looks at her questioningly

SHUI SHENG
Where are the matches

Xiao Jin Bao hands him the lighter and puts a cigarette in her mouth
Shui Sheng takes hold of the gold lighter He hears Liu Shu whispering over his
shoulder

LIU SHU
Its a lighter

Shui Sheng looks at the lighter from every angle but still cant work out how
to spark it

Liu Shu moves to show him but a reproving look from Xiao Jin Bao stops him
dead in his tracks

22 Xiao Jin Bao flips the lighters top and puts Shui Shengs thumb on the
flint-wheel A flame jumps out at the first go

XIAO JIN BAO
(to Liu Shu)
Hes smart

23 Shui Sheng tries to work the lighter a second time It sparks but no flame
appears

24 Liu Shu takes a box of matches from his pocket lights one and walks over
to Xiao Jin Bao who merely looks at him without moving He stops

25 Out of the corner of her eye Xiao Jin Bao watches the match burn down
until the flame reaches Liu Shus fingers

26 The lighter falls from Shui Shengs dumbstruck grasp
Liu Shu jumps forward to pick it up

LIU SHU
What are you doing You good-for-nothing

Shui Sheng is speechless his eyes fill with tears
Liu Shu cups the lighter in his hands and offers it to Xiao Jin Bao
His voice softens

LIU SHU
Forgive him Miss Forgive him

27 Xiao Jin Bao takes the cigarette from her mouth and breaks it in two She
stands up

XIAO JIN BAO
Forget it its not important
No member of the Tang family can be made to
ask forgiveness
Lets go the Master is waiting for me

SCENE 15 EXTNIGHT THE TANG PROPERTY

1 When Xiao Jin Baos beautiful black limousine draws up there are already
many other shining black cars in the driveway surrounded by the usual
black-clad smoking bodyguards

The main building is well lit and an aura of calm seems to reign over the
house

2 Liu Shu gets out of the car first He carefully opens the side door allowing a
tired-looking Xiao Jin Bao to get out holding her gown to one side

LIU SHU

(loudly’)
Shui Sheng Hurry up and help the lady to her
quarters

3 Shui Sheng jumps out of the car to receive the make-up case which Liu Shu
thrusts into his hands

4 The butler arrives to tell her of the Masters arrival
BUTLER
Miss the Master has returned Song Er Ye and
Zheng San Ye have also arrived
Xiao Jin Bao glances at the long line of cars in the driveway Without looking at

anyone in particular she nods to show that she has understood and sets off for
the house swinging her hips generously

SCENE 16 INTNIGHT TANG HOUSE

1 Shui Sheng carries the case and follows Xiao Jin Bao step by step Liu Shu is
still at his side

LIU SHU
Remember the way In the future every time
that she visits you must bring her anything she
requires

2 The marble glistens under the multi-coloured lights in the luxurious
corridors Xiao Jin Bao wearing a traditional costume continues to swing her
hips aware that two pairs of eyes are following her every movement

3 Shui Sheng wears a nervous look Liu Shu also As they reach a corner he
spits and whispers a string of insults

LIU SHU
Look at that trollop When she wears western
clothes she looks like a white whore and when
she wears traditional clothes she looks like a
Chinese country whore

SCENE 17 INTNIGHT THE MASTERS BEDROOM

1 Liu Shu pushes open the heavy polished door of the bedroom Xiao Jin Bao
goes through As he watches her enter Shui Sheng notices that there is
another door inside

Liu Shu closes the first door from the outside

LIU SHU
Miss should I ask the Master to come

XIAO JIN BAO
Yes

2 The two men are left standing in a large lounge decorated in rich-looking
gold colours Liu Shu turns to Shui Sheng and says

LIU SHU
Pay attention When the lady has gone into the
bedroom you must wait here

Liu Shu leans against the wall showing Shui Sheng how he should stand

LIU SHU
And you mustnt fall asleep You just wait like
this and pass on messages if the Master or the
Lady want to eat or drink

3 He points to a servant sitting motionless in front of a door on the other side
of the room which leads to a pantry stocked with all kinds of products from
the most refined to the most ordinary

LIU SHU
He will prepare everything and only when they
for it you bring it in Do you understand

SHUI SHENG
Yes understand

LIU SHU
(still anxious)
Show me how you must stand

Shui Sheng stands against the wall just like he has been shown

LIU SHU

(satisfied)
Not bad Now remember this Shui Sheng The
more you like something the less you should
look at it Even if you want to look at it do so
with your heart not with your eyes
For if you stare at something you become
stupid
For the time being you are merely the ladys
servant but in a few years you too will be
somebody in Shanghai Once you have been
accepted as part of the family nothing will ever
be the same
Do you understand what I have said

- 28
aa oe

SHUI SHENG
Yes

LIU SHU
Now lets go now and ask the Master to come

SCENE 18 INTNIGHT BY THE DINING ROOM

1 Through the gap in the glass partition Shui Sheng sees four men sitting
around a redwood table beneath a sumptuous chandelier There is obviously
tension in the air

2 Liu Shu and Shui Sheng are seated on a couch in a next-door room Without
taking his eyes off the four men in the dining room Liu Shu leans over to Shui
Sheng

LIU SHU
If the Master is in conference with his Brothers
as he is now you cant just walk in
The Master often repeats that we must wait
here until he has finished his meeting The most
banal subject of discussion between the
brothers is more important than any other
matter
Song Er Ye is the Masters most valued
Brother Hes the one you saw at the warehouse
He is like Zhu Ge Liang (a 3rd century
strategist) He is both intellectual and a man of
action If he likes you you have nothing to fear
for the rest of your life
The bulky one is Zheng San Ye the Masters
favourite He merely has to open his eyes for
Shanghai to become quiet and docile He is the
audacious one always the first in the front line
He is easily angered
The old one is Tang Shi Ye (Shi Ye means
steward) He is a blood relation of the Master
the one he confides in the most He looks after
all the Masters business and is the only other
person of any importance among the Tangs
LIU SHU

(cont)
You must pay great attention to these three
men To greet them you just look up once and
then lower your eves to the floor Thereafter
make your eyes retreat into your ears and keep
both wide open
Do you understand

4 The Master looks about fifty years old He is neither tall nor very muscular
He wears a silk Chinese costume beneath his shaven head His creased face and
slightly arched back do not give the impression that he is the Master Only his
well-trimmed moustache and his well-cut dress discreetly indicate his rank as
the Triads number one

5 Song Er Ye is as elegant as ever He talks calmly despite his fiddling with
the frames of his glasses Shui Sheng has difficulty comparing him now with
the man he saw with the revolver in the warehouse

G Zheng San Ye has moved over to the window and is looking out He has his
hands on his hips and the movements of his shoulders betray his rising anger

7 Tang Shi Ye is sitting next to a large clock In his boney hand he holds a
hookah which when he puffs on it accentuates his hollow cheeks

He opens the water chamber containing an abacus which he uses to calculate
sliding the beads up an down with one very long nail He then hands the pipe
to the Master who silently contemplates the abacus

8 Liu Shu continues talking

LIU SHU
The master has the rank of Tong in the Ding
Triad Number Two and Number Three are of
the next generation thus of Wou rank
There was a shoot-out on the Bund and the
master saved their lives Afterwards they held
a religious ceremony to become Brothers
Thats why he is the Master His temperament
has allowed him to build power and authority

9 Shui Sheng listens attentively to Liu Shu whilst gazing fixedly at the Master
then Song Er Ye and Zhang San Ye

Shui Sheng cannot hear what they are saving and his mind starts to wander
Just then a ringing noise brings him back to what is happening in the room

10 Liu Shu looks up He walks over to the telephone and picks up the receiver

LIU SHU
Hello

The conversation stops as soon as the other men hear this word

Later Shui Sheng discovers that the black object his uncle is holding is known
as electric word

Having answered very soberly a broad smile breaks out over Liu Shus face
as though he has heard something which makes him very happy He
subconciously bows slightly

LIU SHU
Its boss Yu

11 They all come over to where Liu Shu stands with the telephone

LIU SHU
(whispering)
Its fat Yu

THE MASTER

Whats happened
14 Liu Shu looks up at Song Er Ye before replying

LIU SHU
Its about this afternoons delivery

THE MASTER
This afternoons delivery

He goes over to the telephone which maks him amile hus as much as Liu Shu

THE MASTER
Ah boss Yu its been a long time since we saw
each other
Im sorry about your sons birthday That day
at Suzhou

The Master falls silent and listens attentively His expression blackens
16 Song Er Ye looks calmly at Liu Shu

THE MASTER
Yes Yes boss Yu Let me look after it Of
course of course

The Master utters several wells” trying hard to keep the smile on his face
then he hangs up He comes over to Song Er Ye

THE MASTER
Number two Youre getting back into bad
habits Why let the small-fry annoy you Why
accord them so much importance

ZHENG SAN YE
What has number two done

SONG ER YE
(calmly)
When we delivered this afternoon Lao Wu one
of Yus men insulted the Master I couldnt help
myself and I shot him

Zheng San Ye glances up at Song Er Ye

ZHENG SAN YE

(lightly)
It’s just another corpse Does a day go by
without someone dying Well just have to pay
a little compensation Whats more number two
was defending the Masters honour

21 The Master crosses his hands behind his back

THE MASTER
Its easy to shit but harder to clear up
somebody elses
(to the Intendant)
I have to go out

The Intendant nods and goes to prepare the departure

SONG ER YE
Brother is that really necessary You are taking
it all too seriously

THE MASTER
I cannot be seen to lose face

SONG ER YE
Brother I am sorry to cause you problems it is
for me to go

The Master waves away his protestations

SONG ER YE
(to Zheng San Ye)
Have some men accompany him

ZHENG SAN YE
Fat Yu is not bold enough as yet

Song Er Ye puts his arm round Zheng San Ye

SONG ER YE
Itis the Master who is going in person we must
be vigilant

24 The Master is waiting his hands still crossed behind his back He looks up
and sees Shui Sheng who has remained by the telephone

25 Liu Shu comes forward hurriedly

LIU SHU

(smiling)
Master this is Shui Sheng He has just arrived
from the country to serve Xiao Jin Bao He is a
Tang - your cousins third nephew
(to Shui Sheng)
Say hello to the Master

SHUI SHENG
Master

26 The Master appears lost in thought and is no longer paying attention to
Shui Sheng

THE MASTER
Ah yes

The Master leaves followed by the others

27 And it is Song Er Ye who looks meaningfully at Shui Sheng as he leaves

SCENE 19 INTNIGHT CORRIDOR
1 The Master stops abruptly just outside the door

2 Xiao jin Bao is standing in the corridor her feet together and hands clasped
in front of her

Her bearing is completely different from that she displayed earlier in the
cabaret She is beautiful and shy and looks obediently at the Master with her
mouth closed and her red lips apparently impatient with desire

XIAO JIN BAO
(in a low voice)
Master

3 The Master scratches his head obviously embarrassed by the situation

THE MASTER
What are you doing here

4 The men who had been following him out turn back into the room and close
the door leaving the couple alone in the dimly-lit corridor
The Master approaches Xiao Jin Bao and strokes her cheek

THE MASTER
(eagerly)
Youre not a woman youre a she-devil

Xiao Jin Bao flashes him a seductive look and lowers her eyes immediately
She takes his left hand and squeezes the index finger

XIAO JIN BAO
Master Its now twelve days since I last served
you

THE MASTER

(laughing)
Ill be straight back Dont worry my sweet
Ill be straight back

The Master extracts his hand from Xiao Jin Baos grasp and knocks on the door
The others come out as if nothing had happened

5 Xiao Jin Bao refuses to let him go so easily

XIAO JIN BAO
(between her teeth)
Which lucky whore are you going to see

THE MASTER

Dont worry Im going to see Fat Yu I have
business to discuss with him

XIAO JIN BAO
I dont believe you
If you gO you must give me all your rings

THE MASTER
(smiling)
Okay then here you are

He takes off two rings

Xiao Jin Bao turns to Shui Sheng takes his hand and slips the rings onto his
fingers

XIAO JIN BAO

(to Shui Sheng)
You see I didnt ask him for money just want
to look after his rings

The rings are of course too big for the boys fingers

XIAO JIN BAO
Look How can you claim to be a Tang Youre
not really born to rule eh

11 The whole group bursts out laughing Meanwhile the Master has set off at
a brisk pace

THE MASTER
Hurry Hurry

bedroom

SCENE 21 INTNIGHT THE MASTERS BEDROOM

1 Shui Sheng gently pushes open the bedroom door
2 He notices Xiao jin Bao sitting on the bed She is whispering into the
telephone and seems tense and mysterious The noise of Shui Shengs arrival
surprises her and she hangs up hurriedly Whan she sees that it is only Shui
Sheng she cries out angrily

XIAO JIN BAO
Why didnt you knock before entering Get out

3 Shui Sheng goes out again He frees a hand from under the tray and knocks
No reply He tries again

Shui Sheng in the corridor feels tears of rage and humiliation welling up in
his eyes
He knocks once more

SHUI SHENG

There is a short silence

XIAO JIN BAO

(nastily)
Come in
SCENE 22 INTNIGHT THE MASTERS BEDROOM

1 Shui Sheng enters with his tray He keeps his eyes fixed to the floor
Suddenly the tray crashes to the floor

2 Shui Sheng stumbles against a large mirror which shatters He pulls himself
up and looks aghast at the remains of the mirror

Xiao Jin Bao’s face appears in one of the remaining shards Along with Shui
Shengs her reflection is contorted

3 Shui Sheng dare not turn round His eyes meet Xiao Jin Baos in the mirror
There is a knock at the door Nobody answers

LIU SHU
Miss the Master has asked me to tell you that
he will not be coming home this evening He

through the deserted streets of Shanghai From his seat in the back Shui Sheng
can only see one side of her face lit by the streetlights

2 Liu Shu leans forward to talk to her

LIU SHU
You must not get angry with him Miss He is
still young and needs time to learn

XIAO JIN BAO
What can I possibly teach a member of the
Tang clan You should ask the Master that

Liu Shu smiles an embarrassed smile and falls silent
The car passing under intermittent streetlights allows Shui Sheng to glimpse
the bright red lipstick worn by Xiao Jin Bao

4 His face gradually transforms itself into a hostile grimace

1 A long-faced servant opens the door to them without uttering a word
through her half-open lips She is dressed in black from head-to-toe making
her even more gloomy

2 She looks at Shui Sheng standing next to Liu Shu with piercing eyes which
make shivers run down his spine Shui Sheng turns away to avoid her
unpleasant scrutiny

3 The servant leads them into a half-moon shaped room The refinement of its
décor distinguishes it straightaway from the gaudiness of the Masters house
A small spiral staircase of ancient design is in the middie of the room

4 Xiao Jin Bao starts up the stairs without turning round

5 Expressionless the servant waves to a room near the stairs and follows her
mistress up the stairs carrying a porcelain bowl she has taken from a low
table

LIU SHU
(to Shui Sheng)
She is dumb but not deaf Her tongue hasbeen
cut out

Shui Sheng shivers at the very idea

SCENE 26 INTNIGHT SHUI SHENGS BEDROOM

1 Liu Shu turns on alamp which casts a dim light over the few objects in the
room

2 He looks around him and points to the bed

LIU SHU
This is where you sleep

He then rings a small bell which hangs onthe wall over the bed It makes a
cracked sound

LIU SHU
When this bell rings it is the mistress calling
you Whatever you are doing evenif you are
peeing you must run toher side as quickly as
possible
Your first word must always be Mistress She
will then tell you what she requires You must
never look up at her and always keep your
eyes in your ears and both wide open
Do you understand

2 For the first time Shui Shengs reply is not that which is expected of him

SHUI SHENG
I dont want to stay here

3 Liu Shu is taken aback He turns round and looks at the boy

LIU SHU
(forcefully)
Shui Sheng

SHUI SHENG
(stubbornly)
No I dont want to stay here

Liu Shu his face twisted with anger smacks Shui Sheng across the face almost
making him fall over

LIU SHU

(through gritted teeth)
Dont force me to beat you Do you think you
have come here to be the Young Master If
your name was not Tang what you have just
said would be enough for me to put you in a
sack and throw you in the river
Remember I havent mentioned the mirror
yet
If you dont do your work well I shail send you
back to the country
Do you understand

5 Streams of tears flow down Shui Shengs face as he strokes his reddened
cheek

Yes

cleavage

5 Xiao Jin Bao sits down at her dressing table massages her neck and looks at
her reflection in the mirror

(6 The door behind her opens slowly It is Song Er Ye wearing a dark suit and
carrying his shoes He is out of breath

7 Xiao Jin Bao does not move

8 Song Er Ye closes the door behind him and slides the bolt across With a
smile he crosses to where Xiao Jin Bao is sitting

9 His reflection joins hers in the mirror both betraying profound desire
The silence is shattered by one of Song Er Yes shoes which drops to the floor
He turns out the lamp but Xiao Jin Bao turns it back on immediately
She then stands up and turns to face Song Er Ye She slips the cord which
controls the lamp-switch into his mouth

10 Xiao Jin Bao takes one step back and offers her slightly open lips to Song Er
Ye

Song Er Ye moves forward to put his mouth to hers and in doing so he turns
out the lamp

In the half-light they roll entwined on the rug Their accelerated breathing
resonates in the absolute silence of the house

SCENE 35 INTNIGHT SHUI SHENGS BEDROOM

1 Shui Sheng wakes from his nightmare with a start He is soaked in sweat
and scans the room trying to remember where he is

2 The small bell hanging on the wall diffuses a yellowish glow

fragile and helpless

SCENE 36 EXTNIGHT THE COURTYARD

1 Night has at last fallen over the house All the lights are now off

SCENE 37 INT-EXTNIGHT SHUI SHENGS BEDROOM
1 Shui Sheng is bent double on his bed sobbing with unhappiness and
homesickness

2 Suddenly his bedroom door opens wide Xiao Jin Bao wearing a shawl
stands on the threshold

The blueish light from the main room defines her silhouette but leaves her
face in shadow

3 Shui Sheng stops crying and looks up briefly before lowering his head once
more
XIAO JIN BAO

(coldly)
When arrived in Shanghai 1 was a year
younger than you But I never once cried Who
has mistreated you What are you crying for
Arent you supposed to be a Tang How can you
be so weak
Hurry up and prepare me a bowl of warm milk
little peasant

Xiao Jin Bao pulls on the string which runs down the door-jamb The harsh
sound of the bell rings out in the silence of the night
Xiao Jin Bao turns on her heel and leaves

at Xiao Jin Baos back as she starts up the stairs

Shengs reflection in the mirror covers one haif of her face

3 Suddenly a woman of about forty bursts in

WOMAN
Mistress Hurry the Master has arrived

XIAO JIN BAO
Why is he here already

WOMAN
The Master Song Er Ye Zheng San Ye They are

Fat Yu to come and hear vou sing
The Master requests you to sing Beautiful
flower in the moonlight
Mistress you must get changed quickly

XIAO JIN BAO
(indifferently)
Fat Yu that pervert

She gets wearily to her feet and lets the woman take off her tunic

XIAO JIN BAO
Shui Sheng give me my Chinese dress

7 Shui Sheng quickly opens the wardrobe but is taken aback by the number
of costumes it contains He chooses a violet coloured dress with a pattern
similar to that which adorns the robes of taoist monks and hands it to Xiao Jin
Bao

8 Xiao Jin Bao throws it back at him without even looking at it shouting
angrily

XIAO JIN BAO
A Chinese dress I said Dont you understand
what that is I want a Chinese dress You really
are thick Do you think that the Master comes
here to pray

WOMAN

1 The Master Song Er Ye and Zheng San Ye are sitting round a table in the
company of a very corpulent man They all seem very relaxed

2 Shui Sheng carries a tray bearing a lea-pot cups and napkins He has taken
up position behind the stage curtain
He watches the dancers who are dressed in typical regional costumes

3 Xiao Jin Bao hurries towards the stage doing up the last buttons of her
silver dress followed by the woman from her dressing room who adjusts her
dress from time to time

As she passes Shui Sheng she takes a cup and gulps down some tea before
placing the cup back on the tray giving the boy a very ugly look

But the moment she steps out into the lights her coldness is transformed into
an expression of warmth and seduction as she begins to dance

4 The Master is the first to applaud as she appears quickly followed by the
rest of the audience

5 Xiao Jin Bao copying the bearing of a Southern Chinese girl sings

XIAO JIN BAO
The clouds disappear
The limpid moon shines bright
The joy of union between people
Drunk with joy
The inseparable swans
cavort on the lake
The twin lotus flowers blossom

6 Zheng San Yes expression becomes rather tense

7 Whereas in Song Er Yes expression there is something which he alone could
explain

8 Fat Yu looks lecherously at the stage before leaning over to whisper into the
Masters ear
The Master bursts out laughing

THE MASTER
You also boss Yu You also

9 Xiao Jin Bao looks in the direction of the Masters table Lovingly half
closing her eyes

10 Song Er Ye exchanges barely perceptible complicitous looks with her

11 The Master clearly thinks that Xiao Jin Bao is directing her attention at
him He is in a very good mood

THE MASTER
What do you think boss Yu

FAT YU

(smiling)
Its interesting to listen to her but its even
more interesting to watch

THE MASTER
Of all the songs in her repertoire this is the one
I prefer
Everybody in Shanghai knows this song But
when she sings it its completely different from
anyone else
Listen to her Isnt it just like the caress of a
feather on ones ear

12 Song Er Ye has moved down to the dance floor and is dancing very
elegantly with one of the dancers

13 Zheng San Ye watches Song Er Ye with a broad smile on his face
14 Song Er Ye does not let his eyes drift from Xiao Jin Bao for a second
15 And without losing step Xiao Jin Bao pays him the same attention

XIAO JIN BAO
Couples love each other deeply
Like the breeze caresses the flowers
Happiness reigns all over the world

16 In a dark corner of the wings Shui Sheng has adopted a rather contorted
version of his usual position

He looks left and then right He produces a cup from underneath the tray into
which he has apparently just relieved himself It is quite clear for whom the

joke is intended

17 Shui Sheng empties the cup into the tea-pot and shakes it up Then he fills °
a cup with his mixture

18 On stage Xiao Jin Bao’s movements reveal a large slit in her dress
19 She continues singing and dancing

20 The applause of the audience mixed with laughing male and female voices
The atmosphere is even more festive than usual

21 Shui Sheng holds his tray as before He peeps out onto the stage and into
the audience smiling to himself

SCENE 41 INTNIGHT XIAOJIN BAOS BEDROOM

down at her dressing table She pours herself a glass of wine and toasts her
reflection in the mirror

2 Song Er Ye gently pushes open the door carrying his shoes as before He is
freshly shaven

3 Xiao Jin Bao is surprised She turns to face him

XIAO JIN BAO
Why didnt you call me first You frightened
me

4 Song Er Ye draws closer with the intention of undoing the belt of her gown
Xiao Jin Bao stops his hand

XIAO JIN BAO
The servants’ doors are not locked

SONG ER YE
(smiling)
Theres only a mute and a little peasant

Xiao Jin Bao shakes off his hands

XIAO JIN BAO
The bumpkin is also a Tang Theyre all
bastards
Song Er Ye takes his hands away and sits at the edge of the table He helps
himself to her glass

SONG ER YE
You really do hate them dont you

5 Xiao Jin Bao turns back to the mirror and rubs her hands over her face

XIAO JIN BAO
And you Dont you hate them Be careful not
to let the Master get wind of what youre doing
Youve been coming too often recently

G6 Song Er Ye takes a sip of wine

SONG ER YE
Recently he’s only had time for Fat Yu He cant
think of anything else
He believes that Fat Yu is being honest with
him But sooner or later hell find out the hard
way

XIAO JIN BAO
You shot Fat Yus man on purpose the other
day didnt you Its not your style to get
annoyed over nothing

Song Er Ye smiles

SONG ER YE
Everybody in Shanghai knows that Im frugal

going to win

be more killing in Shanghai youll see

7 Xiao Jin Bao looks up and glances at Song Er Ye

SONG ER YE
(casually)

Dontworry about all that Thats not why Im
here

He takes Xiao Jin Bao in his arms and kisses her neck She presses up against
him

XIAO JIN BAO
Do you love me

SONG ER YE
(smiling)
What about you Do you love me

Xiao Jin Bao pushes him away unhappily

XIAO JIN BAO
I know what youre thinking about you
hypocrite

Song Er Ye frowns

SONG ER YE
And I know better than you what youre
thinking about You only spread your legs with
me to get your own back on the Master
Im the tool you use to humiliate him
I understand that now

9 Xiao Jin Baos anger has been rising as he speaks She jumps up

XIAO JIN BAO
And what am I to you
The bed on which you take your revenge
You think its enough to sleep with his woman
to become Number One dont you
You think that I cant read your mind
But just whos going to be Number One in the
end Nobody knows

She sits down again

XIAO JIN BAO
Dont touch me Im an honest woman
The Master bought me and I belong to the
Master

10 Song Er Ye bites his lips looking at the woman who is now rejecting him
Her gown has slipped to reveal her thighs He is wild with anger

SONG ER YE
(furiously)
Im the Master now

He grabs Xiao Jin Bao by the hair and throws her to the floor He tears up her
gown

SONG ER YE
(hissing)
Im the Master Im the Master

Xiao Jin Bao lashes out with her feet and they both roll over onto the floor In
total silence

breaking every object in the room Her white gown is torn revealing her thigh
and her back Her hair has come down and she breaks anything she can lay
her hands on

XIAO JIN BAO
Bastard How dare you treat me like a whore
Bastard You think that vou just have to fuck
me to become the Master

2 Xiao Jin Baos chest is heaving as the anger and effort exhaust her She
throws herself on the floor tears pouring from her eyes She hides her face in
her hands and sobs She is painfully aware of her loneliness and sadness

The silence of the night makes her tears even more heart-rending

3 Shui Sheng watches Xiao Jin Bao from outside her room He is unaware of

what has taken place before but astonished to see such terrible sadness his
face takes on a warm expression

XIAO JIN BAO

Shui Sheng is standing against the wall in the position shown him by his uncle

2 The camera moves into close-up to show that Shui Sheng is in fact asleep
3The silence is shattered by the screeching wheels of cars pulling up doors
banging and running feet and shouting

Shui Sheng wakes with a start

SCENE 48 EXTNIGHT FIRST FLOOR BALCONY

1 Shui Sheng looks down into the courtyard as the quiet of the house is
brutally disturbed

2 A line of black cars shudder to a halt in the courtyard their doors swing
open and a number of men jump out carrying corpses out with them

Two groups of men run from the house The first goes to help the men in the
cars the other group disperses to the edge of the property

3 Shui Sheng alerted by the noise of loading notices the rifles each man is
carrying

SCENE 49 INTNIGHT LOBBY

1 The men run towards the bathroom The guards carry a number of bodies
between them

2 Shui Sheng looks towards them
3 The revolving door continues to spin round long the men have gone through
4 Shui Sheng tiptoes forward

5 The mens running creates a breeze in the corridors
Shui Sheng hears the noise of a metalic object falling to the ground and
bouncing off the marble several times with a tinny noise

6 Shui Sheng crouches down and moves forward a few steps

As he reaches the corner he walks on something in the haif-light

The crunch on the marble makes him jump He bends down to pick up the
object and holds it to the light

7 A knife He feels something clammy on its hilt
He changes hands to look at the outstrectched fingers of his right hand closer
to the light

8 Shui Sheng realises that his hand is covered with blood His mouth opens
but no sound comes out His hand lets the knife fall to the floor making the
same metalic noise as before

He looks up

9 A trail of blood runs along the floor with the odd footprint of the men who
have run through it

SCENE 50 INT-EXTNIGHT BATHROOM

Nae eee ne eee el

1 Shui Sheng advances down the mosaic corridor leading to the bathroom

2 The light shines from under the bathroom door and through the frosted
glass panes Shui Sheng can see figures moving

There is the sound of running water and a red liquid is being rinsed from the
floor

3 Panic-stricken Shui Sheng finally pushes the door open

All eves turn to him surprised to see who is the new arrival and they gaze
at him

5 A morbid atmosphere fills the bathroom The only noise is the sound of
water gushing from the tap

Three corpses are lying on the floor One of them has at least seven knives
protruding from it

G The eyes of the corpse are half-open’as if he too were looking at Shui Sheng
7 Suddenly Shui Sheng cries out in terror

SHUI SHENG
Liu Shu Liu Shu

His cry is stifled by a blood-covered hand over hismouth
A mans deep voice barks out an order

MAN
Get him out of here

8 Another man enters It is the Master leaning on one of his mens shoulder

All the pride of being the Godfather of Shanghai has gone out of his eyes His
waist is bandaged with a blood stain gradually expanding over his left hip

wr ST eres Tro

9 He walks forward unsteadily and kneels beside Liu Shus corpse He looks at
the still body for a long moment

BODYGUARD
His eves are still open

10 Grief shoots across the Masters face Shui Sheng sees blood ooze from his
dressing

ll
THE MASTER
The members of our clan always keep their
eyes open even when they are buried

He gets to his feet and goes to the door assisted by his henchman

For the first time he notices Shui Sheng standing by the door his mouth still
covered by the bloody hand

THE MASTER
(harshly)
Let him go

12 Shui Shengs mouth is ringed by a bloody handprint

THE MASTER
(to Shui Sheng)
This was Fat Yus doing
Your uncle stopped the knives from reaching
me
Remember that your uncle has not closed his
eyes
(in China dying with ones eyes open means
that one has regrets or unfulfilled desires)

Tang Shi Ye arrives breathless

TANG SHI YE
Master the doctor is waiting for you Ill call
Song Er Ye and Zheng San Ye

THE MASTER
Why have you called a doctor Im hardly
scratched Dont summon Song Er Ye and Zheng
San Ye just vet All the others must stay here

1G Tang Shi Ye and the Master disappear off down the hall

17 Shui Sheng is left alone in the corridor ignored by those who are left
The bathroom door closes leaving just the sound of the running water

18 Shui Sheng slumps against the wall half his face covered in blood He
senses a presence in the corridor and looks up

19 Xiao Jin Bao is standing in front of him She looks toward the bathroom
After a while she sighs

XIAO JIN BAO
Why did you come to Shanghai

SHUI SHENG
(troubled and stuttering)
to earn money my mother wants too open a
shop selling tofu Ill earn Ill go

‘Xiao Jin Bao slowly reaches forward to take one of his hands With the index

finger of her other hand she wipes away the traces of blood from his face
Shui Sheng is unable to contain himself in the face of such unexpected
tenderness He holds Xiao Jin Bao by the waist and sobs into her chest

SCENE 51 INTNIGHT SHUI SHENGS BEDROOM

SCENE 53 EXTMORNING COUNTRY ROAD

1 They drive along a narrow track along the river threading between small
lakes and villages In the early morning sunlight the wooden shacks along the
river are quiet except for the odd person washing on the stone steps leading
down to the river
Two river junks cross beneath a stone hump-backed bridge disturbing the
shimmering water

SCENE54 INTMORNING BOATS CABIN

eee nnn RN a ra eaten oe ar ame

1 Shui Sheng leans out of the porthole to look outside

TANG SHI YE
Get your head in Whats so interesting outside

Shui Sheng withdraws his head and lowers the blind He turns round and sits
down

The cabin darkens once more with just the odd ray of morning light filtering
through the slats in the blind

2 Shui Sheng is apathetic He sits in one corner of the cabin without talking

3 The Master is in a half-lying position on the bed bolstered by many pillows
behind his back

Tang Shi Ye holds a bow of water in one hand

Xiao Jin Bao gives the Master his tablets which he swaliows without flinching

THE MASTER

(to Tang Shi Ye)
They must just be starting to fight now in
Shanghai

TANG SHI YE

I should think theyre even more worried to
know that you have left the city than to think
that you are still there

THE MASTER

(with a slight smile)
Let them all kill each other
When the gods go to war humans undergo
terrible suffering when humans go to war the
gods go home
Ill just let them have their fun first

Xiao Jin Bao puts down the bowl she has been holding

XIAO JIN BAO
The gods We sneaked away like thieves The
others are more likely to think that youre
scared of them

Xiao Jin Bao puts her arms around the Masters neck with her mouth brushing
against his chin

XIAO JIN BAO
Master I dont want to go anywhere I wish to
serve you in Shanghai

The Master smiles and shrugs

THE MASTER
I have no other course of action In Shanghai
they are ail jealous of my throne
(stroking Xiao Jin Baos hair)
and they want to steal my bed as well

4 Xiao Jin Bao is quietly surprised but her face does not betray her

XIAO JIN BAO
Who would dare take your throne or your bed

5 The Master slowly closes his eyes

THE MASTER
For him to steal my throne and my bed he
must be behind me already
Thats why I am leaving Shanghai to let the fox
come out of his hole
And in a month Ill rub him out shall
withdraw to prepare my attack

G6 Xiao Jin Bao leans her head on the Masters her eyes haif-open

XIAO JIN BAO
A whole month My body will have rusted up

The Master is obviously very happy by what he hears He caresses Xiao Jin
Baos cheek

THE MASTER
No no my little lovely I have found you a
beautiful hiding-place with lovely views
You can use the month to fill out and then when
I am better we will go back to Shanghai
together
My throne will remain my throne and my bed
will remain my bed
I am still Godfather Tang of Shanghai and you
are the Queen of the City of Pleasures

Xiao Jin Bao complaining

2 She is standing with one hand on her hip directing her remarks alternately
to both the Master and Tang Shi Ye

XIAO JIN BAO
This bed is far too small How do you expect me
to be able to sleep on something that size

TANG SHI YE
(wilfully misunderstanding her)
It is quite sufficient for one person I think

Tang Shi Ye talks in a calm and deliberate voice

Xiao Jin Bao stares at him His apparent incomprehension cuts her short After
a few seconds’ hesitation she replies

XIAO JIN BAO’
So where do I sleep

Tang Shi Ye takes the small box from Shui Sheng and places it on the Masters
bedside table

TANG SHI YE
You You will sleep in the next room The
Master needs to rest Whats more it will allow

THE MASTER

buried Its the Tang custom

1 Xiao Jin Bao lifts the quilt from the bed and holds it to her nose and creases
up her beautiful face She throws the quilt back down and cries out

XIAO JIN BAO
How am I supposed to sleep under such a thing
Its got all sorts on it

Nobody replies There is a heavy silence hanging over the island

Xiao Jin Bao stands still for a moment and then sits down on the bed which is
made pf bamboo As she does so the bed creaks loudly She tries to sit
perfectly still

Slowly at first then faster and faster she rocks from side to side

2 The noise of the creaking bed becomes her sole company She continues
accelerating going further to each side each time She finally establishes a
rythm resembling the music of the City of Pleasures

Somebody knocks against the wooden wall It is the Master His knocking is
not particularly loud but is very explicit Xiao Jin Bao stops suddenly and
Temains still once more After a few minutes she gets up and goes over to
extinguish the small lamp on the table

3 Xiao Jin Bao turns to try to find a comfortable position on the bed Her
ahgitation makes the bed creak again
There is another knock on the wall This time it is Tang Shi Ye

TANG SHI YE

(hissing through the wall)
Mistress Settle down quickly -you are
disturbing the Master

Xiao Jin Bao turns over one last time on the bed

XIAO JIN BAO

(angrily)
You will have to change my bed then Its more
of a radio than a bed

TANG SHI YE
We shall do so tomorrow Mistress The Master
is tired after so much travelling
If you carry on like that the Master will get
angry with you

SCENE 64 EXTNIGHT HOUSE

1 Xiao Jin Bao opens the main door of the house and walks out onto the
terrace

2 In the night thelimit betwen the sky and the lake is blurred except for
where the moonbeams shimmer across the waters surface Guards criss-cross
on the paths outside the house

3 Xiao Jin Bao walks along the terrace When she reaches one corner of the
house she stops

4 She has noticed the tiny silhouette of Shui Sheng caught in the moonlight
5 Xiao Jin Bao watches him from the corner of the house For the first time

she feels a similarity between them and this feeling encourages her to go
towards him

6 Shui Sheng hears her footsteps approaching and looks up When he
recognises who it is he stands up and scuttles off with his eyes fixed to the
floor

As he goes past Xiao Jin Bao speaks to him

XIAO JIN BAO
Stop

Shui Sheng stops

XIAO JIN BAO
Why do you walk away when you see me Do I
frighten you

Shui Sheng does not reply nor does he look up

XIAO JIN BAO
Why arent you in bed

After a moments silence Shui Sheng replies
SHUI SHENG
(softly)
I cant sleep
Xiao Jin Bao looks at him
XIAO JIN BAO
(soothing)
Do you have any other relations in Shanghai
besides Liu Shu

9 Shui Sheng remains silent

XIAO JIN BAO
Stay here a while if you cant get to sleep

Xiao Jin Bao sits on the terrace and looks out at the lake Shui Sheng sits down
at her side

11 The shimmering water is a dark blue colour The moon seems like a huge
ice cream in the sky

12 Shui Sheng glances at Xiao Jin Bao She is sitting with her back towards
him

The autumn moon defines her silhouette Suddenly without turning round
Xiao Jin Bao asks

XIAO JIN BAO
Can you climb trees

SHUI SHENG
Yes

15 Xiao Jin Bao looks up her face pointing towards the moon

XIAO JIN BAO
Whan I was a little girl at home we had two
big mulberry trees in the garden
For the people in our village the two trees
meant that somebody of great value would be
born under our roof
Each summer the trees would be covered in
mulberries and all the neighbours would come
round to eat them
We children would climb into the trees and
only come down when we couldnt eat any
more

Xiao Jin Bao turns rounds to look at Shui Sheng

XIAO JIN BAO
You see Im a peasant too Xiao Jin Bao the
bumpkin

This makes her smile

16 Shui Sheng smiles tooFor the first time he detects a note of tenderness in
Xiao Jin Baos laugh
He cannot help himself from talking

SHUI SHENG
I have an older sister in the country She likes
mulberries too

17 Xiao Jin Bao smiles gently at him without saying a word She turns back to
look at the moon shining over the lake After a moment she speaks

XIAO JIN BAO
As soon as youve got enough money for your
tofu shop go back home Whats the point in
staying in Shanghai

SHUI SHENG
I want to avenge Liu Shu The Master told me
that Liu Shus eves are still open

19 Xiao Jin Bao turns to face Shui Sheng once more
It is now the Xiao Jin Bao that Shui Sheng is used to seeing

XIAO JIN BAO
If the Master likes pigs you want to become a
pig If he likes dogs you want to become a dog
If thats what you think go and die in Shanghai
Go to bed

20 Shui Sheng does not know what to do He jumps up and enters the house
21 As he reaches his bedroom door he turns round
22 Xiao Jin Bao remains sitting in the moonlight motionless

23 The tears welling up in her eyes reflect the light of the moon just like the
water on the lake

overwhelmed by the long wavy hair gold earrings bracelets high heels and
long dress

21 Xiao Jin Bao returns her attention

XIAO JIN BAO

days Whan I am no longer bored Ill send her

CUI HUA

23 Xiao Jin Bao offers no reply She walks towards A Jiao and squats down
before her

XIAO JIN BAO
A Jiao Tell me who is nicer between your
mother and I

24 A Jiao smiles Her eyes flit from her mother to the woman in front of her
She is at a loss

XIAO JIN BAO

A Jiao blinks shyly

A JIAO

(It is the Custom in the Chinese countryside not
to enter a house or a room without being
invited to do so)

CUI HUA
(embarrassed)
It doesnt matter go ahead

While she says this Cui Hua nevertheless keeps one hand on the door

XIAO JIN BAO
No You will choose an outfit for me

14 Cui Hua enters the room and from the main room Xiao Jin Bao can hear her
moving around

15 She sits down once more barely able to contain her laughter

CUI HUA
Ive found one Ive found one

Cui Hua is red-faced as she emerges from the room She hands some clothes to
Xiao Jin Bao A green suit with a flowery pattern neatly folded with
embroidery down the seams

XIAO JIN BAO
Look at this vest Its beautifully made you
really are very talented

CUI HUA
You are mocking me Thats very easy to do

XIAO JIN BAO

(projecting her voice)
If I were a man I would want you to be my
wife

Cui Hua gives an embarrassed smile

SCENE 73 EXTNIGHT ISLAND

i When Xiao Jin Bao comes out of the houseshe waves the jacket over her
head gaily but she clamps her free hand over her mouth to contain her
laughter

2 Shui Sheng watches her unable to grasp the reason for her good mood

SCENE 74 EXTNIGHT THE HOUSE

1 The guards continue to peer suspiciously in the direction of Cui Huas house

SCENE 75 EXTSUNSET THE EDGE OF THE LAKE

1 The suns last rays shine over the autumn reeds The sky is clear without
any trace of a cloud The lake reflects the glow of the sun

2 A Jiao and Shui Sheng are washing clothes at the edge of the lake

A JIAO
Shui Sheng Ge what is the most interesting
thing you have seen in Shanghai
(Ge means brother)

SHUI SHENG
The iron cock It sits on top of a building and
rings once for each hour

A Jiaos eyes gleam as she listens to him

A JIAO
And what else

SHUI SHENG

The electric lamps You pull on a string and the
glass bulb becomes bright There is lots of
electricity inside
The telephone also No matter how far you are
from someone you just sit there and say hello
and you can hear everything he says

82
A JIAO
Whats electricity

Shui Sheng thinks for a moment then shakes his head

SHUI SHENG
I dont know Ive never actually seen it

A JIAO
Shui Sheng Ge the next time you come bring
me a little bit of electricity 1 will swap you a
fish for it

SHUI SHENG
(very sure of himself)
No I dont think I can bring you any

A JIAO
Shanghai must be a really good place to be

9 Shui Sheng does not reply at first
Then

SHUI SHENG
Its good in the daytime but not so much at
night

10 Xiao Jin Bao is approaching wearing the suit Cui Hua gave her the night
before as if she were modelling it in a fashion show
Her bearing shows that she is very happy with her new costume
She reaches the two children and gives them her biggest smile
11 A Jiao looks at her and smiles back
A JIAO

Yinang why are you wearing my mothers
clothes

(Yinang” means aunt and is Customary for a
young girl adressing a woman of her mothers
generation)

12 Shui Sheng smiles at Xiao Jin Bao also

XIAO JIN BAO
Do I look good

A JIAO
Yes

XIAO JIN BAO
Do I look like your mother

A JIAO
Yes

1G Xiao Jin Bao draws even closer to A Jiao

17 A Jiao laughs

XIAO JIN BAO

(immediately)
In that case in the future you must call me
Mummy and you will call your mother
Aunt

A JIAO
Can you teach me to sing Shui Sheng told me
you sing very well

18 Xiao Jin Bao throws Shui Sheng a look

19 He averts his eyes

20 Xiao Jin Bao sits down

XIAO JIN BAO
Shui Sheng lied to you I dont know how to

P sing

21 A Jiao doesnt believe her

22
XIAO JIN BAO
When one sings one must sing what one wants
to say Sing only good songs

A JIAO
And what are those songs

24 Xiao Jin Bao keeps quiet She seems lost in thought

XIAO JIN BAO
Do you like singing

A JIAO
Yes

on XIAO JIN BAO
Well you must first sing me a song then
Afterwards Ill teach you other songs

27 A Jiao is a litle embarrassed She casts a quick glance at Shui Sheng before
Starting to sing

A JIAO
Sway on sway on palanquin
All the way to grandmothers door
Grandmother is calling me
My little treasure I cry and I laugh
Two dogs carry the palanquin

28 Xiao Jin Bao is very pleased

oo 85
XIAO JIN BAO
I know your song A Jiao My grandmother
taught me it when I was little

She starts singing with A Jiao

XIAO JIN BAQandA JIAO
Sway on sway on palanquin
All the way to grandmothers door
Magpies are singing on the roof
Theres a pair of red trousers
and a flowery jacket
Grandmothers coming with me
in the Brides palanquin
Sway on sway on Palanquin
All the way to grandmothers door

29 Shui Sheng laughs happily Watching Xiao Jin Bao he Tealises that he has
never seen her like this

30 Xiao Jin Bao beats out the rythm laughing unreservedly She is radiant

31 The piants glow in the soft autumn light the reeds sway in the wind The
lakes water glitters

32 Xiao Jin Bao looks out over the lake and her smile freezes on her face
33 The legs of a corpse emerge from the water and float Slowly towards them
34 A cloud passes across Xiao Jin Baos face and she turns away

35 A Jiao and Shui Sheng have already stood up and are walking away
chattering and laughing

36 Terrified Xiao Jin Bao leans forward to have a better look at the corpse

37 The corpse floats closer and closer It is a mans body and he is wearing
the same grey jacket as the one Xiao Jin Bao saw in Cui Huas house the night
before

38 Xioa Jin Bao’s mouth falls open her face marked with complete
astonishment

annie

1 Shui Sheng much tenser than just before looks towards the Masters
bedroom Tang Shi Ye and his bodyguards are near him looking in the same
direction

Tang Shi Ye keeps at a respectful distance from the door Nobody knows what
is happening inside the room

2 The Masters door is closed but raised voices can be heard from time to
time It is hard to understand exactly what Xiao Jin Bao and The Master are
Saying to each other

THE MASTER
(vo)
Yes gave the order So what No-one knew
who he was I have to be vigilant
And then silence
After a moment the Masters voice makes itself heard again
THE MASTER
Shanghai follows me wherever go Dont get

involved in my business Those who have tried
to do so have all ended up regretting it

3 The Masters voice rings out clearly with each word Spoken very precisely

Shui Sheng thinks that Xiao Jin Bao would be better not to Say anything
Tang Shi Ye wears a satisfied smile

4 Suddenly the noise of a porcelain object breaking comes through the door
The Master cries out angrily

THE MASTER
He runs away from the shit that he has stirred

up
Who dare say sucha thing

The door is suddenly pulled open

Xiao Jin Bao emerges looking very strained She walks determinedly and
angrily Nobody has ever seen her in such a fury Her face is pale and the
blood has drained from her lips She looks Straight in front of her She kicks
open her bedroom door and disappears

SCENE 77 INTNIGHT KITCHEN

1 Xiao Jin Bao pushes open the door

SHUI SHENG
You are up
SCENE 78 EXTNIGHT

1 Xiao Jin Bao and Shui Sheng walk out of the house with a guard following
them

GUARD
Mistress where are you going

Xiao Jin Bao stops and glares nastily at the guard without saying a word The
guard takes a few steps back

GUARD
Take care mistress

SCENE 79 INTNIGHT CUIHUAS HOUSE

1 Xiao Jin Bao opens the door and smiles at Cui Hua
XIAO JIN BAO
Saozi this evening you will have the time to
talk with me

2 It is not very late and both Cui Hua and A Jiao are making baskets Cui Hua
puts down her work and hurries over to Xiao Jin Bao

A JIAO
Yinang

Shui Sheng sits down next to A Jiao to help her
Xiao Jin Bao sits down also Cui Hua doesnt know what to say to her She goes
back to her work

XIAO JIN BAO
Saozi how old are you

CUI HUA
I was born in the year of the horse

XIAO JIN BAO
You could be my younger sister Why have you
let yourself age like that

bad

CUI HUA
A weathered skin attracts less flies

XIAO JIN BAO
(spontaneously)
Why dont you marry again

CUI HUA
You are joking with me again Madam live in
the country not in the City

XIAO JIN BAO
That doesnt stop you loving a man
11 Cui Hua looks across at her daughter

CUI HUA
Please stop mocking me

XIAO JIN BAO
I cant believe that a woman like you does not
attract mens attention

If you want I can introduce you to some

A JIAO
(interrupting)
Yinang my uncle adores my mother
14

CUI HUA
A Jiao Its time you were in bed

15 A Jiao does not move smiling

XIAO JIN BAO
(slowly)
Ah I see Saozi

17 Cui Hua is disconcerted to know that her secret has been revealed

CUI HUA
(to A Jiao)
Go to bed Now

18 Xiao Jin Bao continues probing

XIAO JIN BAO
When are you going to be married

19 Cui Hua looks at the floor

CUI HUA
A Jiao says the first thing that comes into her
head
I dont know yet

20 Xiao Jin Bao looks Straight at Cui Hua with a serious expression on her face

will come specially with two red silk quilts and
a set of red pillows I want your bedroom to be
filled with red candles and red Shuang Xi
(Shuang Xi means double happiness and is
often written on pieces of red Paper at
weddings)

Xiao Jin Baos eyes seem to have become entranced by the smoking flame of
the oil lamp

XIAO JIN BAO
Or I could give you a white wedding dress
made of lace imported from France Two small
boys will follow you holding the train

21 Cui Hua is taken aback

CUI HUA
Madam stop mocking us we are only poor

22 But Xiao Jin Bao is unable to restrain herself She takes Cui Hua in her
arms

XIAO JIN BAO

(to herself)
The woman who doesnt want to get married
does not exist However often you must do it
its always better to be married

CUI HUA
(sighing)
But the gods only allow a woman to marry once
If she gets married twice she will have her
heart broken a second time Its her fate

XIAO JIN BAO

You are very lucky to have a peaceful life on
this island and to have someone who loves you

CUI HUA
If you were asked to spend your life here you
wouldnt say the same thing Why do all the
peasants go to Shanghai otherwise Things
must be better there

24
XIAO JIN BAO
If I get married one day I want to do it here
You will be my witness

CUI HUA
What You are not married already

26 In the dim light of the oil lamp Xiao Jin Bao simply shakes her head

CUI HUA
(concerned)
Why arent you married You shouldnt be too
demanding
XIAO JIN BAO
Yes

28 Xiao Jin Bao smiles All of a sudden tears well up in her eyes

XIAO JIN BAO
Youre right I should get married
But Im afraid that Im never going to see him
by my side again

29 Cui Hua tries to console her

CUI HUA
You must be patient Madam

30 Xiao Jin Bao nods her head The light catches her tears as they begin to roll
down her cheeks

31 Cui Hua puts down her half-finished basket and takes Xiao Jin Baos hands

CUI HUA
You just have to be honest and wait for him
patiently Hell come to you one day Men are all
the same

XIAO JIN BAO
Yes

But the tears continue to roll down her face

CUI HUA
The first time I saw you I knew that your life
was not easy You didnt need to tell me Wait
patiently Patience is all that a woman has

34 Xiao Jin Bao throws herself into Cui Huas arms She holds onto her neck
and sobs uncontrollably

XIAO JIN BAO
Saozi I should never have come to your house
nor to this island I feel guilty about what is
happening to you

Cui Hua does not really understand what Xiao Jin Bao is saying but she holds

her in her arms and consoles her as she would a younger sister

35 Shui Sheng and A Jiao are afraid but can only look at each other

SCENE 80 EXTMORNING THE HOUSE

1 The Master comes out of his bedroom for the first time since his arrival on
the island He seems fully recovered completely different from the day he
arrived All the men turn to greet him

2 Cui Hua is in the middle of setting the table She is slightly tense as it is her
first encounter with the Master

CUI HUA
Good Morning Master

3 The Master is in a good mood

THE MASTER
Oh so you are Cui Hua Sao

CUI HUA
(surprised)
Sorry You know my name

THE MASTER
I eat your fish soup every day How could I
forget your name

The bodyguards burst out laughing as if the Master has said something
extremely amusing

The Master sits down He spots A Jiao

THE MASTER
And you must be A Jiao

A JIAO
Good morning Grandfather
(in China all children refer to older men as
Grandfather - ye Ye)

The Master takes hold of A Jiaos hand and draws her towards him He looks
her up and down

THE MASTER
Shes beautiful just like Xiao Jin Bao at the
same age
Where is Xiao Jin Bao Shui Sheng go and find
her

5 But before he can move Xiao Jin Bao emerges from her bedroom looking
very tired Her arms droop the length of her body giving the impression that
she has not slept all night
THE MASTER
Xiao Jin Bao look at this little girl Dont you
think she looks like you when you were her
age

7 Xiao Jin Bao gives no reply

8 The Master remains calm and turns his attention to Cui Hua

THE MASTER
Cui Hua Sao please Prepare two chickens at
midday I am expecting guests
(to Xiao Jin Bao)
Number Two and Number Three are coming

9 Xiao Jin Bao is quite clearly surprised

SCENE 81 EXTDAY THE LANDING STAGE
eT IE LANDING STAGE

1 Zheng San Ye comes out of the boats cabin shouting

ZHENG SAN YE
Shit its too hot in there I thought I was going
to suffocate

2 The Master Tang Shi Ye Xiao Jin Bao Shui Sheng and a few others are there
to welcome them

Song Er Ye and Zheng San Ye come towards the Master to pay their respects
The Master seems very happy to see them

SONG ER YE
How are you feeling

The master pats his side to show that his wound has healed and that he is
back to full health

SONG ER YE
(relieved)

Excellent

Zheng San Ye takes a cigar from his pocket lights it and takes a long puff with
unconcealed pleasure

3 Song Er Ye walks forward looking at Xiao Jin Baos feet

SONG ER YE
(to Xiao Jin Bao)
Madam

XIAO JIN BAO
(smiling)
Er Ye

ZHENG SAN YE
(loudly to both Song Er Ye and Xiao Jin
Bao)

Whats happened to you both In the space of a

few days its as if you didnt know each other

THE MASTER
(softly to Song Er Ye)
How are things down there

Song Er Ye takes a number of newspaper cuttings from his pocket and hands
them to the Master

The Master reads them immediately nodding his head with satisfaction

Zheng San Ye draws closer

Their three heads seem to resemble each other

7 Song Er Ye steals a glance at Xiao Jin Bao

8 She moves off towards the house

9 Song Er Ye turns away disappointed

The Master folds the cuttings and holds them out to Zheng San Ye who flicks

his lighter and burns them

10 The Master watches the bundle as it is gradually reduced to ash
96
THE MASTER
At least the knife has served a purpose

ZHENG SAN YE
Very true Very true

SONG ER YE
But you must still be careful

THE MASTER
(patting Song Er Ye on the shoulder)
Iam lucky to have you as my brothers

SONG ER YE
We merely did what you asked of us Its
mostly Number Threes doing

THE MASTER
I understand

SCENE 82 EXTNIGHT THE HOUSE

1 The night is dark and the island is quiet

2 Somebody slides down one of the posts of the terrace noiselessly

3 It is Xiao Jin Bao She crouches down and looks around her

4 At one end of the terrace the tip of a guards cigarette glows in the night

5 Xiao Jin Bao leans forward and scuttles off towards the rushes

SCENE 83 EXTNIGHT RUSHES

The Autumn breeze continues to blow through the reeds All is dark
Two forms are entwined

2 Song Er Ye holds Xiao Jin Bao close He is sitting slightly behind her kissing
her neck

Xiao Jin Bao has her eyes half-closed Her reactions are much more muted than
before Perhaps because they are no longer in Shanghai Perhaps because
recent events have changed things for her They both seem tense and worried

Song Er Yes eyes flit constantly between Xiao Jin Bao and the reeds
surrounding them He leans forward

SONG ER YE
Has he begun to suspect me

Xiao Jin Bao does not reply Her eyes have closed and her head rests on his
chest She seems to be thinking about something else entirely Song Er Ye cups
her chin in his hands and continues giving her tender pecks on the neck

SONG ER YE
(sollicitously)
Tell me Does he have any doubts

Xiao Jin Bao leans her head still further back and reaches up to stroke the side
of his head

XIAO JIN BAO
Do you really love me

Song Er Ye continues to kiss her neck
SONG ER YE
Yes Havent you already noticed Havent
always been faithful to you

3 Xiao Jin Bao turns round abruptly She takes Song Er Yes hands in her own

XIAO JIN BAO

(animatedly)
Take me away Lets leave Shanghai and go far
away

SONG ER YE
Where

XIAO JIN BAO
Anywhere want to marry you Let me be a
young bride and lead a normal life I will love
you as long as have breath

4 Song Er Ye smiles

SONG ER YE
Whats happened to you After a few days on
this island youve started hallucinating

Xiao Jin Bao takes her hands away and her expression hardens

XIAO JIN BAO
Will you take me away or not

Song Er Ye pulls her back towards him

SONG ER YE

(softly)
I want you to be a young bride my bride but
its impossible just now When take over in
Shanghai I want you to be the most beautiful
young bride ever
You must have patience and listen to what I tell
you
Why did the Old Man call me to this island

Xiao Jin Baos enthusiasm is waning She tries desperately to recapture it She

has one last try but she is no longer sure of herself even

XIAO JIN BAO
Who cares about Shanghai Forget it all and lets
go

5 Song Er Ye is no longer listening to her He is deep in his own thoughts

SONG ER YE
(frowning)
He hasnt made me come all this way for
nothing There must be something important

Song Er Ye turns back to Xiao Jin Bao and says jokily

SONG ER YE
You havent given me away I hope

Xiao Jin Bao looks at Song Er Ye with deep disappointment in her eyes She
suddenly transforms herself into her Shanghai personage

XIAO JIN BAO
Other than that do you have anything
interesting to say
Me Given you away I was the one who was
given away in Shanghai How could I ever give
someone else away after that

7 Song Er Ye rediscovers his expression of tenderness and gently strokes her
cheek

SONG ER YE
You know Im doing all this for you Think
about it Where could we go together Even if I
took you underground he would find us
If he hasnt found out this time Ill have
another chance to get him
(gritting his teeth)
Fat Yu is totally useless We could have had it
all over with the other night

8 Xiao Jin Bao does not want to listen any more She shrugs off her lovers
hands

XIAO JIN BAO
If I came here this evening it wasnt to listen to
you talk about your dealings with Fat Yu
Im going in

Song Er Ye holds her back

SONG ER YE
Try to get the Old Man to tell you why he called
for us Tomorrow night at two oclock here
Xiao Jin Bao walks away in complete silence

9 Song Er Yes face takes on a nasty aspect

SONG ER YE
(brutally)
Stop
10 Xiao Jin Bao stops

SONG ER YE
(hissing)
If the Old Man knows about us neither you nor
I will survive do you understand
Thanks to your considerable charms the Old
Man cant resist you You must try to find out
what he knows Here tomorrow at two okay

XIAO JIN BAO
Ah Are you getting angry now Okay
tomorrow morning Ill go and see the Master
and tell him Do you realise that your brother
is trying to take your place and he has already
taken your woman

So saying she turns on her heel

13 Song Er Ye stays hidden in the rushes and watches Xiao Jin Bao disappear
into the night Behind his glasses his eyes are shot through with menace

SCENE 84 EXT DAY

1 Shui Sheng comes running along the walkway clutching his hands to his
stomach and looking very ill

GUARD 1
Shui Sheng what have you eaten How many
times have you been to shit today

SHUI SHENG
Six times

GUARD 2
And how many more times before tonight
Look behind the house and count how many
piles you have made already Cant you smell
it If you keep on shitting close to the house
Ill belt you

SCENE 85 EXTEVENING

ee a

1 Clouds are gathering in the sky and the wind is blowing up In the distance
there are rolls of thunder The storm is approaching -

SCENE 86 EXTNIGHT THE HOUSE

1 The front door opens suddenly and Shui Sheng comes running out like a
Jack from a Box He runs down the steps pressing his hands against his
stomach as if trying to keep something in

GUARD 2
You again Go further away Havent you
noticed the winds changed direction Go round
the other side Go on

3 Shui Sheng turns round and runs off in the opposite direction

SCENE 87 EXTNIGHT RUSHES

De a ee nana

1 Shui Sheng squats down in the reeds Suddenly he hears two voices
whispering

MAN 1
Shit its going to rain

MAN 2
Good itll make thing easier for us

Shui Sheng is taken aback He dare not breathe but turns round slowly to see
where the voices are coming from

2 Where he is the reeds are very thick Shui Sheng cannot make anything out
but the voice is very close to his position

FIRST MAN
Whats come over Song Er Ye Why does he
want to eliminate Xiao Jin Bao

SECOND MAN
Dont ask too many questions Just remember
when she comes by you grab her from behind
and strangle her with the rope

FIRST MAN
But Song Er Ye told us to stab her

SECOND MAN
Listen If we kill her with the knife her lovely
skin will be spoilt and shell bleed and then we
wont be able to have any fun with her

FIRST MAN
But if it starts raining where are we going to
hide
SECOND MAN

In the lake Theres hardly anybody on the

island Dont worry
3 Shui Sheng wriggles through the reeds trying not to make any noise
4 When he is far enough away he gets up off his belly

5 But instead of running normally he decides to crouch down and scuttles
‘along on all fours

oo 103
SCENE 88 INTNIGHT THE MASTERS BEDROOM
1 Shui Sheng bursts into the room

2 Song Er Ye Zheng San Ye and Xiao Jin Bao are gathered round a table
playing Mah Jong with the master

Tang Shi Ye is sitting next to the Master When they hear the door open the
whole group turns round to face the intruder

Without hesitating a guard steps forward and grabs Shui Sheng

3 Shui Sheng had not imagined that there would be so many people in the
Masters bedroom He breathes heavily unable to open his mouth staring at
Song Er Ye and Xiao Jin Bao

4 Xiao Jin Bao is the first to ask a question

XIAO JIN BAO
Shui Sheng what is going on

5 Shui Sheng still has difficulty getting his breath His eyes move from Song Er
Ye to the Master

’ SONG ER YE
(harshly)
Shui Sheng How dare you infringe the rules
Get out if you have nothing to say Cant you see
that the Master is in the room

7 The Masters experience prompts him to interrupt Song Er Yes rebuke of
the young boy He observes Shui Sheng and smiles at him

THE MASTER
(weighing his words)
Shui Sheng what have you seen

8 Shui Shengs hesitations are washed away He speaks directly to Xiao Jin
Bao

SHUI SHENG
Mistress you must not go out later Dont go

9 Xiao Jin Baos expression changes completely

10 Nobody understands what Shui Sheng is talking about except Song Er Ye
who freezes in his seat

11 The Master continues to coax Shui Sheng to reveal what he has seen

THE MASTER
Shui Sheng speak slowly What have you
heard Have you heard something or have you -
seen someone

SHUI SHENG
I heard two people talking in the rushes they
work for Song Er Ye
I heard them say that they were going to kill
the mistress tonight

13 The room falls completely silent except for the noise of a Mah Jong piece
bouncing off the floor Dropped by whom

Nobody moves

Xiao Jin Bao stares at Song Er Ye who has broken into a sweat His face has lost
all its colour

Zheng San Ye takes his hand from the table and puts it in his pocket

With a deathly stare Tang Shi Ye looks at the Master who stands up and
walks slowly over to where the guard is holding Shui Sheng His face is still
smiling but his eyes bore into Shui Shengs

THE MASTER
Shui Sheng look at me and repeat what you
have just said

SHUI SHENG
(stammering)
1 I wasnt feeling well When I squatted
down I heard voices over there in the rushes
they were saying
- its going to rain
- the rain will make our job easier

SHUI SHENG
(cont)
- whats come over Song Er Ye Why does
he want to eliminate Xiao Jin Bao
- when she gets here at two oclock you
grab her and strangle her with the rope If she
loses a lot of blood its no fun

Thats what heardand I came running back
on all fours

16 The Master is still smiling at Shui Sheng He asks no further questions
simply maintains his piercing expression

17 It seems as if even the air in the room has stopped moving

18 Xiao Jin Bao stares at Song Er Ye freezing him to the spot

19 Song Er Yes expression has twisted into a grimace He is deathly pale with
one or two beads of sweat breaking out on his forehead He tries to avoid Xiao

Jin Baos eyes

20 Zheng San Ye is particularly alert with his eyes moving from one person to
another

21 The Master nods his head and pats Shui Sheng on the cheek He turns back
to the table without looking at anyone in particular He stretches out his hand
and calmly picks up one of his pieces as if it were the most important thing to
do at the present time

22 Shui Sheng watches the scene without moving

23 The Master keeps the piece in his fingers turning it round and round
without actually playing

24 The noise of the piece grating on the table resonates around the room
Nobody moves and nobody speaks The tension increases with every second

The Master lets out a sigh and looks up from the table

THE MASTER
Lao Er how many men did you bring with you

25 Song Er Yes face is drained of any colour With a great effort he finally
manages to open his mouth

SONG ER YE
Two

26 Xiao Jin Bao breaks into a laugh Her cold stare has been replaced by a
vacant look as if her whole world had disappeared Her eyes are fixed on Song
Er Ye Gradually her laughter subsides as the tears well up in her eyes

27 The Master turns back to Shui Sheng

THE MASTER
Go to bed now Shui Sheng Its over

Tang Shi Ye comes over and leads him to the door

28 The Masters door is firmly closed after him with everybody and all its
secrets locked inside

SCENE 89 EXTNIGHT THE HOUSE

1 Shui Sheng is sitting on the terrace staring at the closed door

2 There is so little sound coming from the bedroom that it is as if the whole
house were asleep A thin ray of light emerges from underneath the door
cutting the corridor into two distinct sections

3 A few armed guards are dispatched to search the rushes

4 Shui Sheng knows that they are going to kill the two men he saw earlier and
thus that Xiao Jin bao will not be strangled or stabbed

He has the vague impression that what he has done will however cause Xiao
Jin Bao a certain amount of trouble and pain

He is very worried about what is going to happen

5 The door is still closed The thunderclaps are becoming increasingly
frequent The rain is about to arrive

SCENE90 EXTNIGHT THE HOUSE RAIN

1 The stormclouds cover the whole sky Thunder and lightning succeed each
other in an increasing rythm illuminating the island for a brief moment before
plunging it back into darkness

2 Hurrying footsteps outside wake Shui Sheng There must be a great deal of
water on the ground because the footsteps splash along

3 Shui Sheng opens the door There is no light in the corridor
He goes to look in the Masters bedroom

4 Its door is wide open and the room is empty Shui Sheng realises that the
house is empty also As he turns to go outside the wind blows the Masters
bedroom door shut with a terrible bang

5 Shui Sheng runs out onto the terrace

6 There a single oil lamp suspended from a post gives off a flickering light as
the lamp is blown first one way then the other by the storm A few people
have gathered around the lamp looking out silently

7 Shui Sheng joins them and follows their eyes into the night

SCENE 91 EXTNIGHT ISLAND RAIN

1 The rain is pouring down Groups of men are huddled round different lights
beyond the terrace Shui Sheng has difficulty understanding how all these
people have come to be on the island

He catches a glimpse of half-a-dozen guards dragging two male corpses along
the ground

The guards throw the bodies into a newly-dug pit Standing around the pit are
more guards carrying shovels Their black trousers are covered with a
yellowish mud from their digging

2 Not far from the pit a group of lights throw up the silhouette of another
huddle of people sheltering under umbrellas

3 The Master is among them with Zheng San Ye and Tang Shi Ye behind him
They are covered by umbrellas held over them by three other men They are
all silent The terrace lamp lights up the falling rain

4 Song Er Ye is led forward by two men He is pushed to the floor just in front
of the Master he has lost his elegant bearing as the rain soaks his hair and
washes it forward over his eyes

5 As he is thrown to the floor his face grinds into the sodden ground Despite
his hands being tied behind his back he manages to pull himself up to kneel in
front of the Master

SONG ER YE
Forgive me Da Ge Spare my life

6 The Master looks at him without replying

7 Song Er Ye shuffles forward on his knees close enough to bang his head
repetitively against the Masters legs His glasses fail from his face as he does
sO

SONG ER YE
Give me a chance just one chance

8 The Master does not even look at him now Instead he stares into the
distance as if he were expecting someone

SONG ER YE
San Di (third brother) help me Save me

10 Zheng San Ye remains silent also
The Master brings his eyes back to focus on the traitor before him
He crosses his hands behind his back

THE MASTER
A little courage number two Tell yourself that
you are dying a heros death
When I return to Shanghai I shall let it be
known that you died protecting me from Fat Yu
I shall mourn you I want the whole of
Shanghai to know that I am still the Master
And then with number three we will go and
avenge your death against Fat Yu

° 109
THE MASTER

(cont)
That way I will repay my debt to him for the
knife which wounded me I am still the Master
of Shanghai Do you understand now

11 Song Er Ye remains motionless for a moment His face is unrecognisable as
he stares blindly upwards

SONG ER YE
DaGe give me a chance I was tricked by Fat
Yu

THE MASTER

I cannot forgive your betrayal I called you
here on purpose to punish you

The Master waves to the guards

THE MASTER
Bury him

13 Two men drag Song Er Ye towards the pit covering his mouth with a cloth
to stifle his screams

Through the rain it is difficult to distinguish anything other than his scuffling
legs which leave a trail through the mud

14 The Master picks up Song Er Yes glasses and looks at them

THE MASTER
(sighing)
Its a shame we wont be able to finish our
game of Mah Jong

restrained by a guard

SCENE93 EXTNIGHT RAIN

SF 97 bk oo Le REE 97 0 AE See

1 The Master takes a lamp from one of his guards He shines it in the face of

Xiao Jin Bao

2 She has not been tied up but is left without shelter from the rain Her hair is
wet and sticks to her face her eyes bear no expression either of hatred or
fear she is in fact very calm

3 The Master leans forward and half-whispers to her

THE MASTER
I shall cover the City of Pleasures with fifty
thousand fresh flowers as a sign of my sadness
L will throw even more flowers into the river
I know how much you like flowers its just a
pity you wont be there to see them
No-one will know of what you have done to me
I do not like losing face That way you can die
as if you had done nothing wrong

Xiao Jin Bao does not look as though she has taken in a word of what the
Master has said Her eyes remain completely impassive

4 The Master pulls away from her

THE MASTER
Do you have anything to say to me

5 Xiao Jin Bao gives no answer She turns her face away and looks into the
distance

6 towards the flickering lights of Cui Huas house

XIAO JIN BAO
I have a last request

THE MASTER
Say it

XIAO JIN BAO
Dont harm Cui Hua or A Jiao They had nothing
to do with any of this

10 The Master stretches out his hand and wipes her hair from her face

THE MASTER

(smiling)
I didnt spoil you for nothing You are the only
one who understands me Im going to keep A
Jiao and take her to Shanghai to bring her up
In a few years she will be the new Xiao Jin Bao
As for Cui Hua Sao it wasnt my fault and you
cant hold it against me She heard a noise came
out of her house and saw everything It was
bad luck You see I cant afford to leave living
witnesses behind
No-one who is not z part of the clan must know
about what happened this evening

11 Xiao Jin Bao looks back towards the lights in the distance Her tears mix
with the rain pouring down her face

XIAO JIN BAO

(to herself)
Saozi I am the guilty one I should never have
come here

12 The Master has missed what she said and draws closer once more

THE MASTER
What are you saying

13 Without warning Xiao Jin Bao throws herself on him in rage She hits
scratches and slaps him in an explosion of accumulated hatred

The Master was not expecting such violence and he is knocked off his feet
Together they roll over in the mud The others were taken by surprise also
Zheng San Ye is the first to rush forward to separate them

However Xiao Jin Bao clings to the Master as though she were rooted to him
The lights start to waver and everything becomes chaotic

Moreover Xiao jin Bao starts screaming insults at the Master letting out ten
years of suppressed anger

XIAO JIN BAO
Tang Lao Da (Number One)1 want to kill you
you old cretin have always hated you I wish
I could kill you Ill be watching you every day
from my grave I want to eat your flesh and
drink your blood Bastard Youll get yours in
the end

SCENE 94 EXTNIGHT RAIN

1 Shui Sheng suddenly cries out

SHUI SHENG
Mistress

He runs forward
2 but somebody holds him back

GUARD
Do you want to die too

3 Shui Sheng shouts and tries to wrestle his way free but the guard holds him
tighter and slaps a muscular hand over his mouth to stifle his screams Shui
Sheng lashes out at fresh air and finally calms down He looks sadly at the
spectacle before him

SCENE 95 EXTNIGHT RAIN

IN

1 The lights barely illuminate a group of people huddled together
Coming from the middle of the huddle is the dull sound of shovels at work

SCENE96 EXTMORNING BOAT
- 1 The boat is ready to depart After the rain of the night before the morning
seems cleaner and fresher

2 The guards resemble a line of ants loading up the boat in the bow of which
the Master is sitting with A Jiao A Jiao is overjoyed and proves it by giving
everyone a big smile

The Master looks at her fondly like an old man taking his granddaughter out
on a trip

A JIAO
Grandfather where are my mother and Yinang

THE MASTER
(with a smile)
They have already left for Shanghai We will
meet up with them when we arrive

A JIAO

lovely clothes

A JIAO

THE MASTER

THE MASTER
Yes yes You will have all you desire

A JIAO

(proudly)

L want to be like Yinang

The Master pats her on the cheek

THE MASTER
Yes of course just like Yinang

3 Shui Sheng is sitting next to them looking at the lake ahead

4 They gradually draw away from the island which in the morning light
seems peaceful and magnificent

Shui Sheng has the impression that he can hear Xiao Jin Bao and A Jiao singing
their song

XIAO JIN BAO and A JIAO
Sway on sway on palanquin
All the way 0 grandmothers door
Grandmother is calling me
My little treasure Icry and I laugh
Two dogs carry the palanquin

5 Tears begin to fill his eyes and he turns away

6 The Master is playing with A Jiao with his back to Shui Sheng

7 Shui Sheng stares at this back and an expression of anger and hatred
sweeps over his face Finally Shui Sheng gets up and throws himself on the

Master
His face twisted with hatred enters the frame and freezes in close-up
