INT HOUSE -- DAY

WERE TIGHT on A MAN sitting at a small table He STARES at
a few clipped newspaper articles in his hands

His name is DAVID ROHACEK Hes late 40s -- and by the way
hes staring intently at those articles we can tell hes a
man on a mission (We cant see the articles)

His FINGERS TAP on the table Hmm Then -- decision made --
Rohacek lights a match and burns the clippings He throws
them into the sink -- SIZZLE -- the articles BURN to a crisp
So Who is this guy And what are the articles about

Ah All will be revealed

EXT WAREHOUSE DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES -- DAY LATER

HAND-HELD VIDEO FOOTAGE of downtown life Workers in a hurry
Buses shriek

The SHAKY FOOTAGE focuses on a windowless warehouse that sits
behind a cyclone fence HOMELESS SHELTER FOOD AND BOARD

A LONE GUARD stands in a security booth at its entrance
Strange A guarded homeless shelter Maybe
INT EXPLORER -- CONTINUOUS

The man videotaping everything is Rohacek parked across from
the warehouse He aims the camera at its entrance

The shaky footage shows A FEW MEN guiding a dozen HOMELESS
PEOPLE through the entrance

Fuck Rohacek looks with concern at the homeless men being
herded inside -- when suddenly he hears

OMINOUS SUNGLASSES MAN
Can I help you

He turns to see OMINOUS MAN WITH DARK SUNGLASSES at his open
window

OMINOUS SUNGLASSES MAN (CONTD)
Thats private property Im going
to have to ask you for that tape

Rohacek considers his options Another Ominous Man In A Suit
begins to approach from the warehouses security booth -- and
worse the homeless group are almost at the warehouse entrance

No time Rohacek SWINGS the video camera and -- CRAACK --
takes out three of Ominous Sunglasses Mans teeth He dashes
out of the car --

EXT HOMELESS SHELTER WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

-- and races towards the warehouse yelling at the homeless
as theyre herded inside

ROHACEK
Stop Dont go in Stop

The homeless group turn to him confused Rohacek scrambles
up the cyclone fence

ROHACEK (CONTD)
Its not what you think Dont go
in
Another Ominous Man opens the warehouse door and quickly ushers
the homeless group towards the entrance

ROHACEK (CONTD)
Dont Stop

The homeless guys look at him He looks worse off than them --
a crazy guy screaming at the top of his lungs as hes YANKED
off the fence by the guard

Rohacek struggles desperately -- a VIOLENT ELBOW into the

guards face momentarily frees him but the other OMINOUS MEN
reach up and DRAG him down onto the dirt

Crunch A knee sinks into his stomach He crumbles gasping --
and looks in despair as the homeless group disappear into the
dark warehouse

ROHACEK (CONTD)
Noooo

The metal doors SLAM tight sealing them inside

Thump A gun butt collides with the back of Rohaceks head
He goes down hard

EXT UNKNOWN FACILITY DOWNTOWN -- DAY

A van pulls up outside the building on the other side of town
The back doors open and Rohacek is carried inside on a gurney
INT LONG CORRIDOR UNKNOWN FACILITY -- LATER

Rohacek is now in a blue patients uniform and he is being
half-carried and half-dragged down the corridor by SADISTIC
GUARD and OVERCOMPENSATING BODYBUILDER GUARD

Patients in cells on either side of the corridor silently
watch the spectacle Their doors are reinforced Plexiglas
their rooms snow white and empty their eyes scared and lonely

Theyre not drooling psychos They look like regular guys
whove been thrown in here and shot up with thorazine

Rohaceks eyes dart anxiously back and forth as hes dragged
by Poor fuckers Poor me

They haul him to a double door a secure guard station at its
entrance A man in a white doctors coat stands there tall
and silent waiting with a clipboard DR PENZLER

SADISTIC GUARD
Section 48 Hallucinations paranoia
Usual deal

Rohacek looks up at the impassive Dr Penzler

ROHACEK

I know what youre doing

(no answer)
I know what you are

(no answer)
You think youre safe You think
youve got me here you think you
can keep me here you think no one
else knows whats happening

Rohacek glances through the Plexiglas double doors Inside
is A COMMON ROOM with patients milling about

ROHACEK (CONTD)
But youre not safe Theres others
like me And were going to stop
you

Dr Penzler gives a small gesture to Sadistic Guard -- a slight
nod of the head barely anything at all -- but judging by how
quickly the guard responds Dr Penzler is clearly a man of
great power and authority Take him inside

Overcompensating Guard SLIDES A KEYCARD -- the Plexiglas doors
BUZZ OPEN They HURL Rohacek inside just another patient
now

He BANGS on the doors stares at Dr Penzler through the glass
ROHACEK (CONTD)
You hear me Were going to stop
you

And this is where you enter the picture

You get in the truck gun the engine -- but there are two men
in the middle of the road in front of you guns aimed straight
at you -- and theyre not moving
BURKE
Duck

Lisa lies low as you floor it straight at them They SHOOT --
but you stay the course -- a split-second before you flatten
them they leap away just in time

BLAM BLAM

They take out your back tires as you pass The truck SWERVES
violently straight into an oncoming Cadillac CRAAAASH

The truck ROLLS onto its back skids to a stop

Dazed you reach for Lisa Shes okay upside-down still
buckled in

You drag yourself out of the battered car Unbuckle Lisa and
pull her out the smashed window

But as you stagger out you see the men swarming towards the
car guns held high

BURKE (CONTD)
Wait Dont shoot

But BLAM -- ONE OF THE GUYS takes a shot at you dirt ERUPTING
near your leg

Its over Lisa takes your arm Theyre going to take you
down

The men move forward guns raised ABOUT TO SHOOT -- when

A VAN

suddenly screeches up beside you The back doors swing OPEN
and

STARBUCKS GUY

leans out and lobs a small grenade towards the approaching
men KA-BOOM

The grenade EXPLODES sending clouds of smoke and debris
through the street the men scattering for cover

Starbucks Guy LOBS another concussion grenade -- KA-BOOM
The LEAD SUV RISES into the air in a fiery inferno

Next to you the drivers window of the van slides down
revealing a familiar face

ROHACEK
Hi Nick Howve you been

Again with the Nick You stare at Rohacek (Remember
The guy from the opening scene)

ROHACEK (CONTD)
Get in

LISA
(to you)
Who are these people

Blam Blam No time to talk The men take shots at you
through the thick smoke ripping holes in the up-turned car

You grab Lisa and pile into the back of the van -- but
Starbucks Guy HOLDS Lisa off

STARBUCKS GUY
Not her Just you

BLAM BLAM The shots get closer

BURKE
Im not going without her

Starbucks Guy takes in the oncoming men emerging out of the
thick smoke guns FIRING -- and he yanks her in as well and
closes the van doors

Screech The van takes off It speeds around the corner
leaving behind a mass of twisted metal and glass

INTEXT VAN -- CONTINUOUS

The van SWERVES violently as Rohacek steers through the crowded
streets Starbucks Guy LEANS out the back window FIRES an
AK-47 at the SUVs giving chase

SMAAASH Bullets SHATTER the back windows as the SUVs TRADE
SHOTS You scream at the guy driving

BURKE
Rohacek Youre gonna get us killed

LISA
You know this guy

Rohacek turns back as he races through the streets

ROHACEK
You havent told her

LISA
Told me what

ROHACEK
You havent told her who you are

BURKE
Dont listen to him --

STARBUCKS GUY
You think he sells wheelchairs You
think thats who he is

LISA
How do you know these people

SCREECH Cars COLLIDE violently trying IN VAIN to steer out
of the vans way as it CAREENS onto a FREEWAY OVERPASS

You LEAN forward GRAB Starbucks Guy

BURKE
You killed him didnt you The
delivery guy --

STARBUCKS GUY
I didnt kill anyone They did it
His stomach was human stew right
Youknow thats how they roll --

He TAKES another SHOT through the broken window at the SUVs
giving chase BLAM-BLAM

STARBUCKS GUY (CONTD)
Get with the program They were

coming for you Its all real
Its all happening Just like we

thought
Lisa GRABS you

LISA
WHOARE THESE PEOPLE

BURKE
We met in apsychiatric facility

SCREEECH Rubber burns as the van swerves the SUVs chasing

LISA
An asylum You were in an asylum

BURKE
We didnt call it that --

LISA
Youre telling me Ive been living
for two years with a mental patient

BURKE
Was Was a mental patient Im
rehabilitated

LISA

Oh my god
BLAM BLAM Bullets TEAR into the vans doors

LISA (CONTD)
And these two are also nutcases

STARBUCKS GUY
Hey lady back off on the labels

Blam Starbucks Guy UNLOADS the AK-47 out the back window at
the SUVs Blam CLICK Out of ammo

Screech The SUVs swerve and HIT the van trying to knock
it off the overpass

Rohacek accelerates SWERVES back -- and KNOCKS the SUV
straight into an oncoming truck Cruuunch

One SUV left It approaches fast -- and out of the window a
man leans forward with an RPG launcher

STARBUCKS GUY (CONTD)
Nick In there

He points to a chest beside you But you cant stop staring
at the CARNAGE outside

BOOM An RPG EXPLODES just in front of the car sending
asphalt and gravel CASCADING into the windshield Rohacek
swerves around the fiery crater

STARBUCKS GUY (CONTD)
Nick

You spring into action open the chest -- its jam-packed
full of weapons ammo and grenades Holy shit

STARBUCKS GUY (CONTD)
Grenade

You grab the grenade pass it to Starbucks Guy -- he leans
out the broken window HURLS the grenade at the last SUV just
as the guy with the RPG is about to take his second shot --

KA-BOOOM The SUV BLOWS to pieces its burnt wreck
SOMERSAULTING down the road behind you

Thats the last of them For the moment The van disappears
off AN EXIT and accelerates away

INSIDE THE VAN an EERIE MOMENT OF SILENCE as the chaos
settles Lisa wipes glass and dust off her face GLARING
DAGGERS at you Starbucks Guy checks his chest of weapons
Rohacek turns back to you from the drivers seat

ROHACEK
Good to see you again Nick

INT APARTMENT SANTA MONICA -- DAY

WERE TIGHT ON MR SPECTORS CORPSE as its carefully lowered
and placed in a body bag

A FIGURE looms over the bag before they zip it Its the
other man from the opening Dr Penzler the man who greeted
Rohacek in the facility He stares at Spectors corpse

Beside him theres a MAN IN A SUIT A long scar RUNS along
his cheek He lowers his blackberry from his ear

SCARRED MAN
He escaped

Dr Penzler nods Zzzzip Scarred Man CLOSES the body bag
over Mr Spectors pale face

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING SANTA MONICA -- CONTINUOUS

Two Agents flank a couple of familiar faces standing by an
SUV outside -- Fat Guy Passing Time and Divorcee Trying To
Make Ends Meet They stand nervously as Penzler approaches

AGENT
These are Mr Burkes co-workers

DR PENZLER
I understand you saw the package
that was delivered to him

FAT GUY PASSING TIME
We saw the DVD

DIVORCEE TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET
He made it himself

FAT GUY PASSING TIME
He said he was going to save the
world

DIVORCEE TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET
Whats going on

DR PENZLER
Did you see the other contents of
the package

FAT GUY PASSING TIME
(shaking head no)
He took it with him

DIVORCEE TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET
Is he going to be okay

DR PENZLER
Mr Burke is a very disturbed person
Were trying to save him from himself
before something terrible happens

He gestures to the agent with them

DR PENZLER (CONTD)
Thank you for your help I insist
my men give you a lift home

The agent opens his car door for them For a moment Fat Guy
Passing Time hesitates -- he looks anxiously at the body bag
that contains Mr Spector as its placed in a van near-by

FAT GUY PASSING TIME
Wheres the ambulance

SCARRED MAN
Were taking care of everything

AGENT
(gestures to car)
Lets get you home

They hesitantly get inside the car and disappear behind the
tinted windows

Dr Penzler walks away Behind him the car doesnt move
They could be dead inside there Just like that

Or maybe not
EXT DESERT -- DAY

Somewhere well outside Los Angeles the van swelters across a
lonely dirt road in the desert

INT VAN -- DAY

The van shakes Starbucks Guy sits opposite you the gun
resting in his lap

Lisa leans across to you A slow burn waiting to explode

LISA
Are you going to tell me whats going
on here --
STARBUCKS GUY
(interrupting)
Hey You better pay the man respect
(to you)

Tell her who you are Go on
Youd rather not thanks very much Not right now

ROHACEK
Hes not a wheelchair salesman
Thats not who he is Thats what
he does to conceal who he is Hes

a genius

STARBUCKS GUY
A scientist

ROHACEK
A geneticist

STARBUCKS GUY
The worlds greatest geneticist

ROHACEK
He was a prodigy Harvard PhD at
23 Invented the transvector at 24

LISA
The what

ROHACEK
The transvector A bioengineering
device that instantaneously --

LISA
You cant even toast a bagel

BURKE
(under your breath)
Can we talk about this later

LISA
Yeah I1l1 come visit you in the
nuthouse and well all workshop this
hows that

STARBUCKS GUY
Hey What did I say about the labels
you fucking bitch --

BURKE
(lunging at him)
Back off --
ROHACEK

Everyone just calm down

STARBUCKS GUY
(to Rohacek)
I told you we shouldnt have brought
the chick

She YANKS OPEN the door -- gutsy at 45 mph -- and tries to
leap out You PULL her back in She struggles lipstick
keys and wallet flying out of her jacket --

LISA
Get off me

She KICKS Starbucks Guy into Rohacek Screech The van
swerves to the side of the road Lisa hauls ass out of the
back door

EXT DESERT -- CONTINUOUS

She does a Marion Jones arms and legs pumping -- Blam A
gunshot KICKS up sand by her feet She stops dead Turns

STARBUCKS GUY

go --

STARBUCKS GUY
Cant risk it Get back in pumpkin

She moves to the van You reach to help her in -- BUT SHE
PUSHES your hands away

LISA
Dont touch me

-- and steps back into the van
INT VAN -- DAY
Starbucks Guy drives now Rohacek riding shotgun

Your feet and hands are tied to the chair So are Lisas
You try to lean close to her

BURKE
Can I explain Please
(she ignores you)

Could you just --

LISA
(interrupting)

BURKE
I told you I had a complicated past
I told you I didnt deal with stress --

LISA
You said you popped a few Klonopin
Who doesnt pop a few Klonopin I
chew on tem like M and Ms before a
presentation --

BURKE
My problems were a little deeper
(off her look)
I had hallucinations Paranoia
Delusions

LISA
Delusions Exactly what are we
talking here Did you think you
were Napoleon Did you hear voices
Were the black helicopters following
you How crazy were you

BURKE
Crazy enough to think I wasnt crazy

She SHAKES her head in frustration trying to process this

LISA
So I take it you were never an
engineer

BURKE
(shaking head no)
I was a research scientist
(pause)
Theres something else too I told
you I was engaged

LISA
Yeah Vicki You said it didnt
work out

BURKE

Theres more to it She was a
scientist too

INT LABORATORY -- DAY (FLASHBACK)

Dressed in a white lab coat you walk through the sleek high-
tech lab passing centrifuges bioreactors and incubators
the essential tools of the genetic engineer

BURKE (V0O)
We worked together at USAMRID the
major biodefense laboratory in the
US

You move through a secure glass partition and into the
BIOCONTAINMENT AREA - where VICKI WADE works at a long row
of Plexiglas cages full of rats on one side and rabbits on
the other

BURKE (VO) (CONTD)
My job was to imagine the worst
bioplague a terrorist could
manufacture so that I could create
the vaccine to protect us against
it To help me I invented the
transvector

You prepare a small metallic device the size of a paperback
it has two INPUT areas one OUTPUT and a digital read-out

BURKE (V0O) (CONTD)
the first device that could
immediately target a plague to destroy
whichever species you desired It
required two elements

Using a vacuum test-tube you add a plague sample into one of
the inputs The read-out analyzes it YERSINIA PESTIS
AMPLIFIED BACTERIAL PLAGUE

BURKE (VO) (CONTD)
The first was the bioweapon I used
an amplified strain of Yersinia
Pestis the black plague that wiped
out two-thirds of Europe in the Middle
Ages -- its effectiveness multiplied
thousands of times

Vicki extracts blood from an unconscious rat with a syringe

BURKE (VO) (CONTD)
The second element was a DNA sample
for the target species For my
trial I inputted a sample of rat
DNA

She places a sample of the rat blood on a small tray in the
second INPUT The read-out analyzes the DNA thousands of
genome sequences scrolling by

BURKE (V0O) (CONTD)
The transvector genetically combined
the two elements so that the plague
was now only targeted to kill rats

After a moment it reads GENE SEQUENCE FINALIZED PLAGUE
TARGET SPECIFIED

BURKE (V0) (CONTD)
It would be harmless to any other
species

You place the transvector in a sealed vacuum door inside the
rat cages and press the trigger to ACTIVATE Theres a WHOOSH
as a single drop of the plague is released into the cages

The horrible effects take place within seconds The rats
jerk slightly BLOOD LEAKS from their mouths eyes and ears
they ROCK SIDE-TO-SIDE their bodies SHAKE as if a series of
small detonations erupt inside their bodies scattered BURSTS
of blood and fur and skin SHOOT onto the glass walls SPLAT

BURKE (V0) (CONTD)
The transvector was a massive success

Within seconds the entire rat population lies dead The
rabbits utterly unaffected stare curiously at the dead rats
around them

BURKE (V0O) (CONTD)
If I had engineered human DNA into
the plague one drop would take out
the entire west coast One test-
tube would wipe out all humanity

LISA (VO)
How is that a success

BURKE (V0O)
If I could create it it was only a
matter of time until a terrorist
did This way I had a headstart I
kept its design secret and I started
work on a vaccine to protect us

Your eyes FOCUS INTENTLY on the dead rat corpses Perhaps a
little too intently And are your hands starting to SHAKE

BURKE (V0) (CONTD)
But the responsibility -- the stress --
it was too much I started
deteriorating Mentally And thats
when I found it The anomaly

CUT TO
MICROSCOPIC BLOOD CELLS swim in a petri dish Were now
INT LABORATORY -- DAY
and youre not happy with what youre seeing in the microscope

BURKE
Where did this come from

VICKI
Its regular donated plasma

BURKE
This isnt human plasma See
Theres some kind of genetic anomaly
Look at the nucleus structure

VICKI
Are you sure I cant see it

You STARE AGAIN into the microscope -- then type at your
computer

BURKE (VO)
But I knew what Id seen What Id
thought Id seen This was my area
of expertise I emailed the CDC to
issue a national alert The public
blood supply had been compromised

INT BIOCONTAINMENT AREA - NEXT DAY

BURKE (VO)
But next day there was no response

You scan your emails on a computer Beside you Vicki works
A SERIES OF BUNSEN BURNERS heating various liquids

You take a glass from a near-by specimen fridge and chug it

VICKI
I dont know how you can start every
day with iced chocolate

You SWALLOW the last drop still unhappily scrolling emails

BURKE
Im going to send the CDC another
email They shouldve responded by
now --

But before you can you see -- through the Plexiglas partition --
TWO MEN enter the lab They approach solemnly flash an ID
through the Plexiglas

FED AGENT
Dr Matheson Were federal agents
Your security clearance is being
revoked We need to collect your
research seed samples plague lines
and the transvector prototype

BURKE
Youre not collecting anything You
cant just revoke my clearance --

The other Fed Agent punches in a code on a glass door that
separates the lab from the biocontainment area -- where you
Vicki the plague samples and the transvector are

BURKE (CONTD)
You have no right to come in here --

The code is DENIED Youve re-programmed it

FED AGENT
Open the door sir

BURKE
Youre not federal agents are you
(they dont answer)
This is about the anomaly isnt it

The Fed Agent takes out his gun

FED AGENT
Open the door Now

Theres a LARGE VAT beside your console marked ETHANOL As
you PUNCH in the code to open the door you quietly lean down
and OPEN THE VALVE and REMOVE the SAFETY DRIP TRAY

Thick liquid SLUDGES towards the array of lit Bunsen Burners

FED AGENT (CONTD)
Open it

You FINISH PUNCHING in the code on the console -- and MAKE
SURE Vickis seen the HIGHLY FLAMMABLE ETHANOL streaming
towards the bunsen flames --

She gives you a slight NOD - shes seen it -- B2ZZT -- the
doors OPEN and you step through

But just as Vicki steps out first the Feds ROUGHLY GRAB her --

BURKE
Hey

You turn on them grapple to release her -- but VICKI gets
SHOVED BACK through the doors and INTO the biocontainment
area She glances at the FLAMMABLE LIQUID INCHES FROM the
Bunsen flame -- and desperately grabs the door Locked

BURKE (CONTD)
Let me up --

You try to get to the security panel but the Feds hold you
down WHOOOSH

BURKE (CONTD)
Nooo --

The ethanol reaches the bunsen and catches alight FLAMES
SNAKE BACK to the vat and EXPLODE setting the entire
biocontainment aflame Plasma supplies seed samples the
transvector -- all of it becomes a fiery inferno

VICKI

looks at you in horror Within seconds her hair and skin
are alight Her FLESH MELTS as the flames consume her

You open your mouth in a silent scream struggling madly as
The Feds hold you down Vicki burning alive in front of you

EXT ASYLUM -- DAY

The facility is an old military installation downtown Barred
windows Grim and foreboding

INT CELL ASYLUM -- DAY

You WAKE UP curled on the bottom of a bunkbed Look around
groggily -- white walls white everything Where am I You
turn to your left and --

VICKI

reaches for you her face burnt beyond recognition eyelashes
lips skin hair all burnt off --

INT CELL ASYLUM -- DAY

Startled you WAKE and rise out of bed SCREAMING Your
cellmate REACHES down to you from the top of the bunkbed

CARD-TWIRLING CELLMATE
Wake up Wake up
(you calm down)
No point screaming The cells
soundproof and airtight

CARD-TWIRLING CELLMATE slides a playing card the Ace of
spades between his fingers up and down like a magician

BURKE
Where am I

INT TREATMENT ROOM ASYLUM -- DAY
DR PENZLER
Youre in a psychiatric facility
downtown Youve had a breakdown
Im Dr Penzler

Sadistic Guard stands sentry at the door Youre on the bed
in restraints Face pale eyes lifeless

Dr Penzler sits opposite clipboard in hand

BURKE
Youre one of them arent you

DR PENZLER
One of who

BURKE
You sent them to my lab You had
them kill Vicki --

DR PENZLER
I didnt do anything They were
federal agents responding to a false
national alert that you issued
claiming the blood supply was being
polluted by dangerous anomalies of
unknown non-human origin

BURKE
There was an anomaly I saw it

DR PENZLER

(shakes head no)
You went off your medication You
were having a severe paranoid episode

(consults chart)
Apparently not the first time
This has been an issue for you on
and off since childhood hasnt it

You stare at him through heavy-lidded eyes

DR PENZLER (CONTD)
The government cant have you working
in sensitive classified areas when
youre hallucinating about genetic
anomalies They had to close you
down

BURKE
I want to speak to a lawyer I want
to get out of here

DR PENZLER
Youre Section 48 Youll stay until
I decide youre no longer a danger
to yourself or others
(puts his hand on your
shoulder)
Dont worry I wont abandon you

He inserts a needle into your vein pushes down on the syringe
DR PENZLER (CONTD)

Ill show you the worlds not as
complicated as you think

You sink into unconsciousness
INT COMMON ROOM ASYLUM -- DAY

A few other patients mill about You sit by a barred window
staring at a television nature documentary it shows a spider
attacking a fly trapped in its web

NATURE DOC NARRATOR
spiders use their chelicerae --
sharp appendages just above their
mouths - to paralyze their victim
then spray a digestive enzyme to
liquify its organs before sucking
the stew into its mouth

Theres a racket at the entrance You turn to see A MAN being
thrown into the common room

He scrambles to his feet yells at Dr Penzler on the other
side of the door

ROHACEK
You hear me Were going to stop
you

Remember this Its the opening scene of the movie ROHACEK
turns away from the doors surveys the common room

BURKE (V0O)
That was the first time I saw him
Rohacek

His eyes lock with yours You look away nervously focus on
the picture of a cocoon on that tv documentary

NATURE DOC NARRATOR
An amazing transformation occurs as
a butterfly emerges from the cocoon

Rohacek moves in front of the tv obscuring your view

ROHACEK
I know you Youre Dr Nicolas
Matheson The geneticist

He pulls up a chair beside you

ROHACEK (CONTD)
Im David Rohacek Im a scientist
too I read your piece on RNA
replication in The Journal of Genetic

Engineering

BURKE
Youve read me
ROHACEK
(nods)
Activated ribonucleotides to speed
up non-enzymatic replication -- that

was groundbreaking work
(leans closer)
Im a virologist I work with the
cbc tracking emerging retroviruses
(leans in even closer)
I saw something too Theyre trying
to silence me just like you

You look up through bleary eyes A friend Thank god

BURKE (VO)
I told him about the anomaly

A SERIES OF DISSOLVES as you tell Rohacek your story He
listens intently nodding

BURKE (V0) (CONTD)
I told him about Vicki The
transvector Everything And for
the first time someone made sense
of it all for me

THE DISSOLVES END -- and you lean back exhausted after telling
the story But Rohaceks not exhausted Hes energized

ROHACEK
Youre not crazy That was an
anomaly I found the exact same
thing

BURKE
What

ROHACEK
Non-human DNA samples in the public
blood supply evidenced by structural
anomalies in the nucleus I found
thousands from all over the country
so that means theres thousands of
them all over the country

BURKE
Thousands of what
44

ROHACEK

(leans closer)
Aliens Theyre systematically
infiltrating every aspect of society
waiting until they have enough numbers
to take over You think this is a
psychiatric facility This is an
alien observation facility -- a
Panopticon

He gestures towards the mirrors on the wall

QUICK CUT TO in an observation room next door Dr Penzler
watches them through the two-way mirror their voices echoing
through a speaker on the wall

ROHACEK (0S) (CONTD)
Theyre studying us Watching
Learning All the time

CUT BACK TO THE COMMON ROOM
where Burke sits with Rohacek

ROHACEK (CONTD)
I reported the anomalies just like
you They shut me down took my
research -- but not before I found
out what they were doing

EXT DOWNTOWN -- NIGHT

ROHACEK (VO)
I followed one of the men who had
donated blood with the anomaly

Rohacek follows a man who looks totally normal -- JOE NORMAL --
across town

EXT DOWNTOWN -- NIGHT

Joe Normal turns a corner walks towards a warehouse up ahead --

HOMELESS SHELTER -- we recognize it as the warehouse from
the opening

Rohacek follows takes the corner -- when JOE NORMAL steps

out from behind a dumpster and GRABS him He opens his mouth
wide sharp appendages SLITHER out of his mouth and plunge
into Rohaceks neck SLIIIT Just like a spiders chelicerae

Rohacek COLLAPSES to the ground paralyzed Joe Normal throws
him over his shoulder and carries him inside

INT WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT
Rohacek wakes up

Hes in a huge open area shrouded in shadows But all around
him he can see

ROWS AND ROWS OF BODIES

-- not dead bodies but hundreds of homeless adults all unable
to move their shirts RIPPED OPEN to reveal their bare
stomachs

A BURST OF LIGHT invades the room as a door opens and

TEN ADULTS

enter in formation Each goes to the head of a row

Rohacek recognizes one of the adults as Joe Normal That
means the others with him must all be aliens too

JOE NORMAL
KNEELS beside a homeless man in the first row and OPENS his
mouth wide -- wider -- impossibly inhumanly WIDE like a

snake with a dislocatable jaw

His stomach CONVULSES as if hes trying to bring something
up -- and then as his jaw widens a last time out slides

A SLIME-SMEARED EGG SAC

that -- PLOP -- lands right on the homeless mans stomach
Joe Normal SPEWS another few sacs out of his distended mouth
onto the homeless mans stomach then moves onto the other
humans in the row

THE OTHER ALIENS

do the same stretching their dislocatable jaws DROPPING
multiple egg sacs on the paralyzed humans

JOE NORMAL

comes to Rohacek The sac slides out of his mouth and onto
his stomach Plop Paralyzed he can only watch in horror
The men -- or whatever they are -- leave in unison LOCKING

the heavy double doors behind them THUD

ROHACEK manages to move a finger But thats it He glances
beside him The other immobile adults are all as paralyzed -—-
and terrified -- as him

THE SAC

starts to TREMBLE on the homeless man beside him The membrane
fissures with a squelch and

A SMALL INSECTOID CREATURE

emerges shiny with juices round head twitching Chelicerae
EMERGE out of its mouth and PIERCE the homeless mans stomach

The creature dribbles a white juice into the wound the
digestive enzymes break down the homeless mans inner organs
LIQUIFYING his tissues Hes just become human stew

The newborn insectoid buries its mouth in the wound and SUCKS
UP the human stew Other insectoid creatures hatch out of
the sacs and join in the meal SHHLLLP

ROHACEK

manages to move his arm But only just The sac on his
stomach begins to tremble -- and

A SMALL CREATURE

CRAWLS out antennae TREMBLING It SCUTTLES on its multiple
legs towards his exposed stomach

The insectoid settles on his bare belly Its chelicerae
EMERGE razor-sharp twitching towards his skin

SLAP He manages to BRUSH the creature away The insectoid
lands upside-down on the ground SCREECHING it immediately
up-ends itself and scuttles back up to his stomach

Even worse the other eggs on his body hatch as well New-
born insectoid nightmares CRAWL EN MASSE towards his stomach

The one he swatted away reaches his exposed skin first It

LIFTS its chelicerae READY to pierce his skin -- when SPLAT --
he manages to swat another of the creatures towards it

IMPALING it on the first insectoids uplifted chelicerae

The impaled creature SQUIRMS and SCREECHES Suddenly its
FLOODED by the thick white digestive juices flowing from the
insectoids mouth above it (who has impaled it)

Smelling food the other insectoids SWARM towards the impaled
creature in a cannibalistic feeding frenzy

ROHACEK manages to SCRAMBLE away while the insectoids DEVOUR
their own distracted by their meal

He retreats deep into the warehouse hides behind piles of
discarded shopping carts clothes and blankets the remnants
of the homeless abductees

Once the creatures have eaten they SCUTTLE away from the
rows of unmoving carcasses and settle in a quiet spot Each
BEGINS TO SPIN a large wet WEB around themselves

The webs harden into large COCOONS Soon the warehouse is
littered with rows of fresh cocoons and half-eaten bodies

A QUICK SERIES OF DISSOLVES as Rohacek tries to escape from
the warehouse He tries the locked doors a high window the
corrugated iron walls But nothing works

He negotiates through the scattered cocoons when - SPLAAAT --
the cocoon in front of him RIPS OPEN and A HAND pushes out

Rohacek THROWS himself under a hollowed-out carcass to hide

Hairless eyes blinking DOZENS OF HUMANS tear out of the
membranes emerging FULLY-GROWN from the cocoons

The heavy metal doors OPEN and the men -- or whatever they
are -- enter again moving in unison They hurl the dead
abductees into the corner PILING them on top of Rohacek

They reach for the trembling creatures that have emerged from
the cocoons gently wrap them in blankets and guide them
through the doors and to another part of the facility

Just as the last ones leave Rohacek overhears them

MAN 1
The Reproduction Program continues
next week in Tokyo Then Sydney
London New Delhi and Capetown at
monthly intervals --

MAN 2
At this rate the date for critical
mass will be achieved five years
from now November 6th 2009

This time their work finished they leave the metal doors
open behind them Rohacek bides his time then crawls out
from the pile of corpses and heads out through the doors

A variety of Morgue Workers bend hungrily over corpses that
have been pulled out of the drawers in a morgue They spray
the liquefying enzyme over the dead bodies lean forward and
suck up the stew

INT COMMON ROOM ASYLUM -- DAY
You lean forward horrified

BURKE
They eat us when were dead

Is that what theyre going to do to
us

ROHACEK
Were too prominent they cant kill
us This way they find out what we
know mess with our heads then throw
us back out totally neutralized
Whos going to listen to a mental
patient

Suddenly a voice appears from behind them

STARBUCKS GUY
Well make them listen

but now in a blue patients outfit
STARBUCKS GUY (CONTD)

girlfriend six months ago She hasnt

ROHACEK
We cant just take anyone He might
be a plant

STARBUCKS GUY

months I found their base of
operations the reproductive
incubators the Zeta Reticulan war
plans the human abattoirs But I
got too close and they threw me in
here Im one of you -—-

ROHACEK
Open your mouth

Rohacek stretches his jaws examines his gums closely

ROHACEK (CONTD)

liquify their victim -- you can see
the holes if you know where to look

STARBUCKS GUY

STARBUCKS GUY

I heard them talk about November 6th

ROHACEK
Theyre spreading all over the planet
In five years time 2009 their
population will be in the tens of
millions Theyll have critical
mass -- enough numbers to come out
into the open and take over

BURKE
How can we fight them

ROHACEK
We cant But you can
(off his look)
The transvector You can engineer a
plague that only targets the aliens

BURKE
But its destroyed

ROHACEK
(points to your forehead)
But its all still up here isnt

Hes got a point And havent you always felt you were meant
for a higher purpose

Behind you a SMALL GROUP OF OTHER PATIENTS have been
eavesdropping -- they lean forward

GORGEOUS NUTCASE

They took my semen

MIND-SCAN DUDE
They conducted a fourth density mind-
scan on my temporal lobes

CATTLE-MUTILATION THEORY GUY

ANAL PROBE MAN
They probed me Anally

STARBUCKS GUY
Thats not an abduction Thats a

(off his look)
Youre all in anal dudes out

You and Rohacek share a glance There is strength in numbers

BURKE
Welcome

Starbucks Guy pulls up another four seats

GORGEOUS NUTCASE
Shouldnt you check us first

She opens her jaw wide Rohacek nods examines their mouths
one by one

BURKE (V0O)
That was the start And from there
we grew

QUICK DISSOLVES a dozen patients now sit around Rohacek and
Burke hanging on their every conspiratorial word then

twenty then thirty then the entire patient population all
listening enraptured

BURKE (VO) (CONTD)
The word spread like wildfire It
was a dream come true for the
paranoids the schizos the bipolars --
finally someone made sense of their
delusions They werent crazy after
all Their life had a purpose

IN THE PANOPTICON OBSERVATION ROOM -- Dr Penzler watches the
growing assembly of abductees with great concern

INT TREATMENT ROOM ASYLUM -- DAY
Whack Sadistic Guard straps you into a restraint bed pulls

the leather straps HARD Next to you Starbucks Guy and
Rohacek have already been tied to their beds

Bzzt The door opens Dr Penzler enters

DR PENZLER
Ah The leaders of the resistance
(moves towards the beds)
It seems you three are at the
forefront of a movement to quell an
alien invasion And I believe Im
one of the Alien Commanders

BURKE
One of them

DR PENZLER
Good because when I invade a planet
I like to be a Commander Sometimes
I even demand to be Emperor I like
to come in I like to destroy a few
national landmarks I like to harvest
some female eggs and I like to eat
some of the local indigenous people
But thats just me Every Alien
Commander has their own style

BURKE
If were so insane how come we all
believe the same thing

DR PENZLER
Youre all suffering from a collective
delusion A mutually-reinforced
fantasy inspired by our friend Mr
Rohacek

ROHACEK
Dr Rohacek Ive a PhD --

DR PENZLER

Thats what you told them Youre a
scientist

(to all)
He was brought in after a psychotic
episode where he physically assaulted
four people outside a homeless
shelter Thats your scientist

ROHACEK
That was a breeding facility You
were incubating alien eggs --

DR PENZLER

I really cant have you infecting
the entire patient population with
your fantasies

(to all)
Havent you considered how strangely
similar your alien life-cycle is
to the insect life-cycle youve been
watching on The Discovery Channel
247 “The paralysis the cocoon
the transformation Your suggestible
minds have all been subject to media
contamination --

BURKE
(interrupting)
Youre not going to be able to stop --

DR PENZLER
(interrupting him)
Do not interrupt me while Im giving
a monologue I was enjoying hearing
myself speak

He sits on your bed

DR PENZLER (CONTD)

want to help you
(smiles)
I told you I wouldnt abandon you

CARD-TWIRLING CELLMATE
I can lock myself in but I cant
get out I can lock myself in but

Sadistic Guard grabs the keycard out of his hand and passes
it back to the embarrassed guard he stole it from

SADISTIC GUARD

ROHACEK (CONTD)

Strangely Kind Male Nurse leaves Rohacek turns to the other
revolutionaries

ROHACEK (CONTD)
Theyre going to break him Brainwash
him Its just a matter of time

They look at your crumpled figure your eyes glazed exhausted
Rohacek starts laying out an idea to them

BURKE (V0)
Thats when we came up with the plan
In case they cured me we had to
send me a wake-up call in five years
time before the alien invasion

INT THERAPY ROOM -- DAY

A few patients play chess Starbucks Guy Rohacek and you
enter and go straight for the locked cupboard

BURKE (VO)
something that would remind me of
the truth

Starbucks Guy picks the lock easy enough and you bring out a
video camera used for taping the patients sessions Rohacek
sets it up on a tripod in front of you

ROHACEK
Ready

He presses RECORD and you look straight into the lens

BURKE

The screen goes black Lisa looks at you like youre the
single greatest lunatic of all time Which you might be

LISA
And you believed all this

BURKE
My girlfriend was dead Id hada
breakdown I was in a mental asylum

You gesture to Rohacek whos riding shot-gun looking out the
window at the dust clouds outside

BURKE (CONTD)

These poor lost souls You return to Dr Penzler

BURKE

DR PENZLER

You disappear through the exit and into the blinding light of
day

INT VANDESERT -- DAY (PRESENT)
The van SPEEDS on Lisas quiet taking all this in
BURKE
After I got out I just wanted to

have a normal life I changed my
name and made a new start

LISA
And you think this is normal

BURKE
Im sorry I never told you I wanted
to -- so many times -- but I was

embarrassed And afraid I thought
youd leave me

LISA
(shakes her head)
Two years Its all been a joke I
never even knew your real name

BURKE
This is the real me That wasnt
I look at that video and I think
what a sad lost soul I was Trying
so hard to convince myself I was
important

Rohacek has overheard this last exchange He moves into the
back of the van still holding his 45

ROHACEK
I know this is all very
destabilizingbut everythings
under control The important thing
is were perfectly set up to kill
every single one of the aliens

LISA
Really And how are you going to
kill the aliens when that prototype
was destroyed

Rohacek reaches into your backpack brings out OPEN SECOND
rips it open and brings out the TRANSVECTOR An exact
replica of the LETHAL DEVICE we saw decimate the rats earlier

ROHACEK
Totally rebuilt Exactly to Nicks
specifications

QUICK FLASH In the asylums therapy room just after youve
made the tape you write page after page of detailed
INSTRUCTIONS and DIAGRAMS on how to rebuild the transvector
Rohacek takes the pages from you END FLASH

Rohacek proudly pats you on the shoulder You dont share
his enthusiasm And now Lisas getting really freaked

ROHACEK (CONTD)
We also have a sample of the alien
DNA which they kindly donated --

He tears the paper off OPEN THIRD and brings out A SEVERED
FINGER perfectly preserved in a small locked container

QUICK FLASH In the asylums food hall Starbucks Guy swipes
a knife from the canteen line and attacks Sadistic Guard He
holds his hand to the ground and hacks off his finger in a
split-second

As he screams in agony the finger is quickly kicked under
table to table by various patients ending up in the hands of
Rohacek who secretly ferries it out in an ice-pack END FLASH

STARBUCKS GUY
Cost me a year of solitary But it
was worth it

ROHACEK
Getting it out wasnt hard
(MORE)

ROHACEK (CONTD)
They still had to use humans to
deliver supplies

QUICK FLASH HUMAN DELIVERY GUY drops boxes off in the asylums
storage basement Gorgeous Nutcase is waiting for him And

he for her She kisses him deeply then hands him a box --
containing the scrawled instructions the severed finger and
the DVD

He takes off with it Gorgeous Nutcase smacks his ass in
gratitude END FLASH

passenger -- or a prisoner

Lisa tries to sell it with her eyes Please Help me

Starbucks Guy turns the key The engine KICKS in

ATTENDANT (CONTD)

that hes had concealed under the door

Starbucks Guy just manages to push the barrel away -- BLAM
The shot goes through the roof inches away from splattering
his brains

Starbucks Guy WHIPS out his 45 --

The Attendant RE-AIMS straight at him -- but too late -- BAM
Starbucks Guy SHOOTS from point blank range

The Attendant FALLS TO THE GROUND DEAD a bullet hole between
the eyes still clutching your note in his blood-stained hand

You LUNGE forward shove Starbucks Guys hand through the
window SMASHING the glass He DROPS the gun

Lisa KICKS free of Rohacek KNOCKING his head against the
vans metal walls She rips open her shoulder against the
metal wall -- you GRAB her and RUSH out the door

EXT ISOLATED GAS STATION -- CONTINUOUS

Blood seeps through a tourniquet in Lisas shoulder She
leans in to you talks quietly

LISA
Theyre out of their minds Weve
got to do something

She looks in the bag at the severed finger and transvector

LISA (CONTD)
This DNA -- from the alien finger --
they think its going to make the
plague only kill aliens right

(you nod)
But if theres no aliens if thats
just a human finger -- which I think

is pretty likely -- then the plague

will actually target humans right
(you nod again)

So itll wipe out humanity

BURKE
(you nod again)
There might be a few saved People
in air-proof facilities basements
but not many

LISA
You gave instructions on how to
engineer the deadliest plague ever
known to a couple of guys you met in
an asylum

BURKE
I told you I was in a bad place
(off her look)
And I didnt give them everything
Im the only one who knows how to
engineer the last stage of the plague
Thats why they need me

LISA
And youre not going to right

BURKE
Of course not There are no aliens
I know that Im cured

The van turns off onto a small dusty road

Starbucks Guy moves the flame into his throat His flesh
MELTS Smoke wafts around his face

BURKE
Stop This isnt proving anything

Rohacek pulls Starbucks Guy back He reaches for a strange
METAL CONTRAPTION a faceplate with clamps and steel rods

Starbucks Guy opens the prisoners mouth and FORCES the
contraption in place around his face

BURKE (CONTD)
What are you doing

The clamps open the prisoners jaw Metal rods push his mouth
WIDE OPEN

BURKE (CONTD)

his gums He squirms in agony

ROHACEK (CONTD)
The chelicerae are hidden --

Theres a horrible SQUELCHING as he YANKS out a tooth strands
of blood-stained gum hanging from it He throws it on the
tray -- CLINK -- and shines a light in his mouth

He STICKS the pliers in again JABS away The tooth wont
give He yanks twists yanks again -- with a last effort
and a huge scream he RIPS out another gore-stained tooth

But thats not what youre really staring at Youre really
staring at

THE BLOOD-SMEARED CHELICERAE

that stick out of Strangely Kind Male Nurses mouth and are
IMPALING Mind-Scan Dudes stomach

Holy fuck

Strangely Kind Male Nurse is a fucking alien

A thick white enzyme LEAKS out of his chelicerae turning
Mind-Scan Dudes internal organs into a thick soup He DIGS
his hands into the gaping wounds brings the human stew to
his lips and greedily SWALLOWS every drop

Lets repeat Strangely Kind Male Nurse is a fucking alien

Youre FROZEN TO THE SPOT Strangely Kind Male Nurse spots
you wipes his mouth smiles shoves his latest meal aside
and MOVES towards you with unholy speed

Crunch You SLAM to the ground The twitching chelicerae
DART out of his lips and SNAKE towards your stomach Youre
next on the menu

The sharp tips of the chelicerae pierce your skin the
paralyzing enzyme flows towards you -- when

A SCALPEL

slices through one of the chelicerae SLLLIIT White
digestive fluid SPRAYS everywhere

You turn to see Rohacek wielding the scalpel

Strangely Kind Male Nurse looks up stunned -- his remaining
chelicerae SLITHERS back into his mouth his lips still smeared
with remnants of human stew

He opens his mouth and ROARS -- an alien inhuman taunt --
and HURLS himself through the window behind him -- SMAAAASH

Rohacek races to the window Just catches a glimpse of him
as he disappears into the inky desert He hits an intercom

ROHACEK
Secure the perimeter This is Dr
Rohacek The prisoner has escaped
Repeat secure the perimeter the

You hold a cloth to Mind-Scan Dudes stomach -- but blood and
liquified organs SEEP through it

MIND-SCAN DUDE
Did -- he -- escape

BURKE
Shhh Shhh

MIND-SCAN DUDE
Youll save us -- wont you --

You dont have time to answer His body shudders his eyes
stay open with his last breath Hes dead

You bury your head in your hands in anguish the pressure in
your head ready to explode The guilt the responsibility
another dead body --

BURKE
Its all my fault --

IMAGES RAPIDLY FLASH through your tortured brain Spectors
dead body in your lap his insides turned to sludge Gas
Attendant falls to the ground his brains blown out the
insectoid SUCKS up Paralyzed Guys organs youre thrown into
the asylum ECT convulsing your body and most haunting of
all Vicki BURNS to death in front of you END FLASH

Its too much You look at the corpse in your arms and TEARS
BURN your eyes DESPAIR overwhelms you

Better to end it than live like this You GRAB one of the
shards of glass -- and put it to your throat digging into
your skin -- blood TRICKLES as you dig deeper

And thats when ROHACEK comes back in the room He sees you
crumpled holding the glass to your throat totally lost

BURKE (CONTD)
I cant go on I dont want to be

He kneels beside you

ROHACEK
Youre not crazy It is happening

BURKE
I cant save anyone --

You look up at him in despair

BURKE (CONTD)
Help me Please

He gently TAKES the glass out of your hands He puts his
arms around you as you tremble

ROHACEK
We can stop them

And his voice -- his conviction -- is so reassuring that your
TREMBLING stops You nod slowly GAINING STRENGTH from his
confidence

You both look up to see Starbucks Guy in the door-way sullen-
faced

STARBUCKS GUY
It got away

EXT SHELTERED BALCONY RANCH -- CONTINUOUS

Still hidden the sounds of tracking dogs and sirens all around

Finally a dark figure emerges She breathes a sigh of relief
when she sees its you

about you

BURKE
I have to tell you something And I
need you to trust me

LISA

BURKE
No Its not

She searches your eyes takes your hand

LISA
Listen youre hallucinating youre

She tries to make you run with her But you wont budge

BURKE
Im not fighting it anymore This

LISA
Please Dont give in to this You

You told me Youre cured

She looks around anxiously Figures dart along the perimeter

LISA (CONTD)
We gotta go --

She turns -- bam -- only to run straight into the forceful
hands of Starbucks Guy And behind him Rohacek Gorgeous
Nutcase and a group of other ARMED PATIENTS

You take the gun from her hand

BURKE
Were not going anywhere

INT LAB RANCH -- NIGHT

The multiple bioreactors hum in front of you

ROHACEK
The invasion begins at midnight
BURKE
We have time Well do the DNA sample

first

You use a scalpel to cut a tissue sample from the alien finger
put the sample between two slides filled with plastic resin

WE INTERCUT with Lisa in her room at the ranch watching the
video footage of you from five years earlier

BURKE (V0) (CONTD)
we are on the verge of the end
of humanity and you are the only
one who can stop it

IN THE LAB Using your loyal followers as helpers you slice
the hardened resin with a microtome confirm the DNA sample

in the electron microscope then place it in the transvectors
input and turn to Rohacek

BURKE (CONTD)
Im ready to complete the final stage
The plague purification
(off their looks)
Alone

Rohacek nods He LEADS EVERYONE out of the room

Finally alone you take the equipment in Do you destroy it
all Do you tear it apart and run Heres your chance

But you dont destroy anything You get to work You connect
tubing to the bioreactor draining plague-soaked cells from
the hourglass core to a sealed glass collection jar

BURKE (V0O) (CONTD)
you wont want to face what you
have to do but in your heart you
know the truth You know what our
true destiny is You know what will
happen if you fail”

You filter the dregs A sickly-pink plague sludge fills the
collection jar A timer by the drying trays counts down the
time TEN MINUTES and the plague will be infective

Ten minutes And then youre going to have to release it
Are you sure you can do it Are you sure you should

INT BEDROOM RANCH -- MOMENTS LATER

BURKE (CONTD)
Can I show you something

INT INFIRMARY RANCH -- MOMENTS LATER

corpse and the gaping sludge that used to be his stomach

BURKE
Do you think something human could
have done that

LISA

clear I would give anything to be
wrong to be paranoid crazy But
Im not I cant run from this

LISA
Look at these people Were ina
madhouse You cant make this
decision now not in here --

BURKE
I dont have a choice -- Im telling

Isnt that what love is a leap of

faith

LISA
Maybe thats love Or maybe its
madness

BURKE

I know Im doing the right thing
thats all that matters

LISA
Thats what every mass murderer
throughout history has said

You take her hand

BURKE
When I met you I didnt believe in
anything But you gave me hope
Now Im going to do the same for
you

Before she can answer an ALARM RINGS out What now You

and DOZENS OF HEAVILY-ARMED FEDERAL AGENTS (if thats what
they are) who have secured the outside of the ranch

INT GUARD SHACK RANCH -- CONTINUOUS

PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN

Starbucks Guy takes in his alleged girlfriend Is that
recognition on his face Or anger at a cruel trick

Send the scientist outside Im
begging you I dont want to see
you hurt

Ive never stopped loving you

Starbucks Guy turns to you

STARBUCKS GUY

Young Woman aside

DR PENZLER
There are others here who dont share
my patience I need to speak with
Nicolas immediately or I wont be
responsible for what happens

You look at the timer the plague will be infective in THREE
MINUTES

Guy shoves him inside

INT FOYER RANCH -- CONTINUOUS

Starbucks Guy rejoins the patients behind the Plexiglas that
separates the foyer from the biocontainment lab

You step out and approach Dr Penzler in the foyer

DR PENZLER
Hello Nick

BURKE
Dr Penzler

DR PENZLER
Id ask how you are but it seems
fair to say that your rehabilitation
has suffered somewhat of a large
setback

Dr Penzler takes in the extensive lab and equipment his
former patients monitoring the bioreactors standing guard
with assault rifles

DR PENZLER (CONTD)
Very impressive Who knew my patients
could be so focused

BURKE
Take them off the thorazine and ECT
youd be surprised at how productive
they --

DR PENZLER
(interrupting)
That saved your life --

BURKE
(interrupting him)
-- do not interrupt me while Im
giving a monologue I was enjoying
hearing myself speak

Dr Penzler smiles

DR PENZLER
Im here to appeal to you The others
were always beyond help -- they were
only released because the facility
was overcrowded But you were
different You can still make
something of your life With new
treatment we can truly rehabilitate
you in a few months -—-

BURKE
The world doesnt have a few months

DR PENZLER
Ah The alien takeover

BURKE
I saw your nurse turn someones
stomach into human stew Just like
you did to the delivery man

DR PENZLER
Youre having another episode --

BURKE
Is that so And how were the FBI
at my apartment so quickly

DR PENZLER
You think they havent been following
you -- watching you -- for the last
five years You think changing your
name would keep them away Youre
too dangerous They had to make
sure you werent going to relapse --

like you are right now

BURKE
Youre running out of time And you
know it

He gestures to the multiple armed figures outside that proves
how desperate Penzler is
DR PENZLER
This is a legitimate national security
operation to neutralize an unstable
scientist determined to unleash a
unique and deadly weapon

BURKE
So why are you here

DR PENZLER
Because I know you best And I want

to help you -- before they kill you

BURKE
You want to stop me

DR PENZLER
Exactly how far are you willing to
take this Are you willing to destroy
the whole world just for your messiah
complex Just to prove youre someone
special

BURKE
I am someone special

DR PENZLER
Yes Well We all like to think
so dont we

He gestures to the patients inside the lab

DR PENZLER (CONTD)
I dont know how far along you are
with your plan but you have to know
they cant let you finish it If
you dont surrender these people
will all be dead within two minutes

BURKE
You know I cant do that

Dr Penzler looks at the faces of the patients
the intercom so he can talk to them

DR PENZLER
(to patients)

Listen to me I know what you think
is happening here but if theres

one shred of doubt inside any of you
about what youre doing please listen
to it You need to step outside
immediately Your lives are at risk

He moves

to

IN THE LAB - Rohacek glances at the drying trays TWENTY-
SEVEN SECONDS until the plague is infective

DR PENZLER (CONTD)
This is your last chance This
decision is out of my hands

Nobody moves Dr Penzler moves back from the intercom He
looks at you shakes his head sadly

DR PENZLER (CONTD)
It must be a terrible thing to live
inside your mind

He talks into a small microphone stuck to his top pocket

DR PENZLER (CONTD)
(into microphone)
Hes not coming out Proceed as you
wish
(to you apologetically)
I tried

A HORRIBLE HIGH-PITCHED WHINING fills the air growing louder
closer deafening --

Ka-BOOOM Twin rocket-propelled grenades RIP the lab apart
The bioreactors explode corpses litter the smoke and debris
stunned surviving patients stagger to their feet

Ears ringing you move through the shattered equipment and
kneel at the drying trays The plague is INFECTIVE It fills
a small test-tube

DR PENZLER is ushered outside as FEDERAL AGENTS swarm inside
guns blazing

You grab the transvector and reach for the alien DNA sample
but -- BLAM BLAM -- the samples SHATTER in front of you
destroyed by gun-fire

And then -- fuck -- THE AGENT who just shot the samples turns
his gun towards you Its over Youre a dead man

He FIRES -- but youre SHOVED out of the way in the nick of
time as a FIGURE takes the bullet for you

You turn the body over to see whos saved you -- its Gorgeous
Nutcase With a bullet hole -- the bullet meant for you --
right between the eyes Dead

The Agent AIMS at you again -- but just before he shoots a
shot RINGS OUT and he FACEPLANTS on the burning floor DOA

And behind him we REVEAL STARBUCKS GUY -- lowering his 45

STARBUCKS GUY
Come on

He and Rohacek push you through the chaos towards an exit

BURKE

Through the smoke you see Lisa on the other side of the lab

STARBUCKS GUY
Weve gotta go

But you dont move Your eyes lock with Lisa -- on the other
side from you A FEDERAL AGENT approaches her through the
smoke He offers his hand

AGENT
Come with me

She looks back towards you Which way should she go To the
boyfriend who might be insane or to the federal agent who
might be an alien

AGENT (CONTD)
Come with me Youll be safe

But just as his hand almost reaches her Lisa YANKS down on a
fermenter tank - it CRASHES down on the Agent -- and she
SPRINTS through the inferno towards you No going back now

few inches from his hand with the pin still attached

but he cant reach it He tries to pull his arm out from

You move gingerly -- the shoulder hurts -- and meet up with

This is all yours

BURKE
(nodding)
Go to town

Everyone grabs a box TEARS open the top You PULL out a

variety of your old professional mementos -- framed Ph D
and med degrees dozens of articles in Lancet Medical
Journal Virology Remnants of a lost life

Rohacek opens a box -- old clothes

Lisa opens a box -- full of old photos You as a child you

and Vicki graduating together and the two of you both sitting
on a beach tanned and happy and holding hands

LISA
She was pretty

You turn look at the photograph -- but her image is
overwhelmed by A QUICK VIOLENT FLASH of her burnt corpse

Look away Dont think about her Not now Grab another
box Rip open the top Thats it Focus

Behind you Lisa OPENS another box And shes a little spooked
its full of sci-fi toys Mr Spock action figures Klaatu

OPENS another box --this one is full of old sci-fi books
Asimov Heinlein Clarke Bradbury Van Vogt Weird Tales
Amazing Fantasy -- each cover showing a bug-eyed alien reigning
supreme over the helpless human slaves at its feet

She watches you obsessively open the boxes sweating with
manic determination surrounded by your old sci-fi memorabilia

This is getting weird

She pulls out -- a stack of old sci-fi movie posters CLOSE

He PULLS out of a box a small stainless steel CYLINDRICAL
FREEZER powered by a long-life internal battery

You punch an access code into the display -- the alarm disarms
with a BUZZ the light turns green and the lid retracts

With a WHOOSH a cloud of white nitrogen vapor billows out
across the floor Inside a number of identical vials and
jars sit in a plastic tray

You take the glove and tongs from the box and reach inside

BURKE
This is it The plague bacterium
And the DNA sample

You carefully take two small jars out of the freezer Now
lets get out of here -- but before you can move you hear

DR PENZLER
Ill take that

You turn -- to see TWO FEDERAL AGENTS flanking Dr Penzler
both holding semi-automatics at you

DR PENZLER (CONTD)
You really have a very complicated
relationship with reality dont
you

An AGENT grabs Rohacek Dr Penzler TAKES the two jars from
your hand -- and then carefully picks up the transvector

But Lisa Theyre leaving her alone

DR PENZLER (CONTD)
(to Lisa)
You have two minutes

She nods Penzler and the others move back into the corridor
carefully holding the jars leaving the two of you alone

Ah Now its all perfectly fucking clear

keycard into the access slot

Bzzt The metal doors at the entrance GROAN OPEN
EXT ASYLUM DOWNTOWN LA -- DAY

You step out into the harsh sunlight Your eyes adjust you
look around -- to see that

The world is one big open mass grave

Plague-ridden HUMAN CORPSES are EVERYWHERE -- on the sidewalks
the streets door-ways half-falling out of over-turned cars
pressed against the blood-smeared windows of abandoned buses
lying in the gutter outside restaurants

Theres no ambulances No movement at all Just corpses in
a dead world as far as the eye can see

LISA
What have you done

We FLASH around the entire city THOUSANDS OF BODIES lie
slumped in rows at Staples Center NURSES AND PATIENTS AND
DOCTORS BODIES all lie together in hospital wards SECRETARIES
AND LAWYERS AND ACCOUNTANTS all lie dead in their suits
turning offices into makeshift tombs

You look around at the horror in disbelief

BURKE
I dont understand

You can barely get the words out

BURKE (CONTD)
I was so certain I was right

A voice draws your attention to your left

ROHACEK
Hi Nick

You turn to see -- Rohacek Hes kneeling beside a stack of
neatly-piled bodies

Dr Penzlers corpse is in front of him Rohaceks chelicerae

retracts into his mouth and he calmly sticks his hands into
the gaping hole in Penzlers stomach brings the human stew
tohis mouth and swallows

BURKE
Youre -- one of them

Rohacek smiles and wipes his lips

BURKE (CONTD)

But -- where -- are the others I
thought -- there were millions
ROHACEK

(shakes head)
No Just two

Behind him we REVEAL the other alien -- its Strangely Kind
Male Nurse (remember -- he escaped at the ranch) and hes
eating Sadistic Guards insides his one remaining chelicerae
sucking up the broth

Rohacek stands wipes his hands of Dr Penzlers insides
ROHACEK (CONTD)
The others will be here soon -- now

that you cleared the way

You hear something A low deep HUM that grows and grows
HuuuuuuummmmmmmMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM -—

A MASSIVE SHADOW spreads out over the city You look up in
the sky -- to see -- not just one not just two but

THOUSANDS OF ALIEN SPACE SHIPS
in the sky An armada of alien transport vehicles as far as

the eye can see spreading out over the city -- and moving on
towards other cities in the distance
ROHACEK (CONTD)
Weve learnt its easier this way
Let the civilization destroy itself

You just have to target the right
man to do it

FLASH -- To the opening of the film We see now the articles
that Rohacek was looking at in his house PRIZE-WINNING
SCIENTIST ADMITTED TO PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY Theres a photo
of you NICOLAS MATHESON INVENTOR OF THE TRANSVECTOR HAS A
HISTORY OF MENTAL DISORDERS THAT HAVE CULMINATED IN

Rohacek sets the articles alight grabs the video camera and
takes off As the articles burn we see hes circled a photo
of the asylum where you were just admitted

FLASH -- Rohacek is thrown into the same asylum himself

ROHACEK (CONTD)
You hear me Were going to stop
you

He spots you in the common room -- a slight smile crosses his
lips Hes found you THATS why he got himself thrown in
here He moves towards you and introduces himself

ROHACEK (CONTD)
I know you Dr Nicolas Matheson
The geneticist Im David Rohacek
Im a scientist too

FLASH He sits beside you in the common room spinning his
web about the alien invasion”

BURKE
How can we stop them

ROHACEK
We cant but you can The
transvector You can engineer a
plague that only targets the aliens

BURKE
But its destroyed

ROHACEK
(points to your forehead)
But its all still up here isnt
it

You smile Hes right It is all still up there

FLASH -- Thunk Rohaceks chelicerae TEAR OPEN Mr Spectors
stomach in your apartment Rohacek killed him

You did think you were cured so Rohacek had to re-inspire
you to action against the alien invaders -- and turning Mr
Spectors stomach to human stew was the first step

FLASH -- Rohacek waits in the van outside your apartment

Its the scene just after you discover Spectors dead body

He sees you RACE OUT FBI agents chasing you - then follows
FLASH -- so that he can SAVE you here outside Lisas office

building Just when the FBI is going to grab you he pulls

up in the van and HUSTLES you and Lisa inside taking you

away to safetyand the lab in the desert Where hell
convince you to finish the plague that will destroy humanity

FLASH -- by making sure you discover Strangely Kind Male
Nurse eating Mind-Scan Dudes stomach here at the ranch --
proving to you that the aliens exist From the shadows
Rohacek watches your shocked reaction with deep satisfaction

END FLASHES
You stand in the empty dead city that you have created
Rohacek moves slowly towards you

ROHACEK (CONTD)
Id had my eye on a few candidates
over the years but once I found

you the worlds greatest geneticist --

with a history of mental instability --
able to create a plague that could
wipe out his speciesall I had to

do was nudge you in the right
direction After all it doesnt

take an army to destroy the world
Itonly takes one man whos convinced
hes right

We PUSH in on you as the horror -- and truth -- of that lands
In the distance the arriving ships fill the horizon

ROHACEK (CONTD)
The food supply should last us a few
years here

Food supply That is the human carcasses strewn around them
ROHACEK (CONTD)
Then well move on like we always
do

You stare at him with unspeakable hatred

ROHACEK (CONTD)
Oh dont hate me Nick My species
were dying To them Im a hero
You wouldve done the same for your
people
(smiles)
In fact you thought you were

In the sky smaller landing crafts begin to emerge from the
transport ships They float gently down towards earth

Rohacek tears off some flesh from Dr Penzlers body stuffs
it in his belt for later and walks away with Strangely Kind
Male Nurse towards the smaller crafts landing in the distance
You call after him

BURKE
You wont win

Rohacek keeps walking

BURKE (CONTD)
Therell be other survivors

Rohacek stops turns
ROHACEK
There will be But not many Well
round them up cage them farm them
and when weve consumed these well
take them next
He gives a wave

ROHACEK (CONTD)
Bye Nick Thanks for everything

They walk away stepping over the bodies in their path
Lisa steps beside you

LISA
Its the end of the world

You watch the two aliens disappear down the road hundreds of
crafts floating down to earth in front of them

BURKE
No Its just the beginning

FADE OUT

THE END
