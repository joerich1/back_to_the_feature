EXT SALOON - NIGHT

As Haven leaves the hotel and has reached the saloon a
lighted plush-looking spot illumined by kerosene
Sticking a pipe in his mouth Haven saunters in

INT CHARLIES SALOON - EVENING

It is a huge elaborate room lit by overhead

long mahogany bar runs the length of it To one side

is a big stove and the gambling tables Beyond can be
pool tables in an alcove To another side a man grinds
at a piano A stairway near the end of the bar leads to
upper floor The place is crowded and noisy with

odds on the seven then on the come the hard way

point is eight

CAMERA FOLLOWS Haven as still smiling slightly he
towards the bar searching the faces of the crowd as he
Two miners are squared off for a fight and Haven going
way walks between them very indifferent not even
back at the SOUND of scuffle behind him

AT THE BAR - Haven alone is not watching the fight All

others have turned to see it even the barman is busy
watching But Havens eyes are resting on the figure of

woman now at the piano singing Softly as if to

and for her own enjoyment He is near the end of the
near the piano and since no one else listens to her at
moment she sings half smiling directly for him and
self-consciously she stops and turns to sit ata

Haven watches her Behind them the fight is being

and Charlies eyes follow the huge bouncer Mick

he drags the offenders out to the door and the street
is as usual The bartender is back at work As Haven

he finds that the place beside him is now occupied by

young Lieutenant (Phil Stellman) Haven glances at the
uniform then at the pleasant face of the officer as

barman comes up

HAVEN
(to barman)
Whiskey -- like youd pour it for

yourself
A girl sidles up to him blonde brash and pretty
BLONDE

Dont you know its no fun to drink
alone
Not till after the first one

He turns his back to her she gives him a look and

saunters
off The barman produces the drinks -- a beer for
Stellman
the young officer The barman folds his arms Stellman
looks
at Haven
STELLMAN
You a stranger here
HAVEN
(to barman after
gulping it in one
gulp)
What kind of whiskey was that
BARMAN
On the bottle it says Rye -- but the
way you take it I dont see what
difference it makes
Haven smiles at him
HAVEN
Another Rye
The barman turns to get it Stellman is still looking
at
Haven
STELLMAN
(easily)

You didnt answer my question

HAVEN
Im a stranger everywhere

STELLMAN
Got a job

The barman gives Haven another Rye

HAVEN
Listen soldier I know that one
too Got a job stranger No Why
dont you join the Army Three meals
a day a place to sleep a nice warm
uniform --
STELLMAN
It has a little more than that

HAVEN
(deliberately)

Yeah it has one thing more and
thats what I could never take --
(looking at Stellmans

stripes)
Its got Second-Lieutenants

The barman listening senses trouble and signals with
his

eyes to a big bouncer down the bar The bouncer moves
up

quietly

STELLMAN
If you want to make it a personal
matter --

HAVEN
(coldly)
dont make it anything soldier
You tried to sell something and I
didnt buy it -- so why dont you
just beat it

They stare at each other for a long second then
Stellman
speaks icily

STELLMAN
fÂ£ I werent in uniform I might
teach you some manners

HAVEN
f you could teach me anything you
wouldnt be in a uniform

Stellmans jaw tightens then he turns and exits
abruptly
The barman sighs with relief the bouncer turns away

him)

HAVEN
I dont doubt it but his mouth is
too big -- like your ears

He turns away from the bar after flipping a coin on to
while the barman stands there not knowing whether to be
or philosophical

CAMERA FOLLOWS Haven as he threads his way through the
towards the door His eyes catch sight of the girl who
at the piano Charlie She is sitting at a table with
Prince murmurs to her and she glances at Haven then
away again Haven notes it As he comes near the table
blonde who spoke to him at the bar accosts him again

The gaze holds like a spell and then Charlies smile
back from nowhere

CHARLIE
You see -- here everybody fights

HAVEN
I wouldnt know --

So anyone who doesnt like the Army --

HAVEN

She looks at him in a seconds silence Haven turns and
leaves She watches him go Prince studies her face

slim fingers at an habitual trick that of idly

dice in a little pillar and then picking the pillar

holding the lowest dice pinched between the thumb and
forefinger NOT by the edges but by the sides Now he

it as he watches Charlies face Her eyes glance again
the disappearing back of Haven The sense of

seems to have gotten her too Then she realizes the
of Prince and his shrewd gaze She looks at him coolly

CHARLIE
Well -- cool him off

Prince flips the dice into his palm and rises

Stellman and Haven go through then quickly follows

It is remarkably neat and elegant inside As Haven

around pauses inside he finds himself facing a burly
uniformed cavalry officer captains bars gleaming on

side of his collar The captain is big and broad and
He is standing by the fireplace and his eyes are boring

forward as Haven and the captain are measuring each
STELLMAN

Captain Iles -- the Commanding Officer

of the Post
Haven gives a casual nod

STELLMAN
Mr Haven -- sir

Iles looks him up and down Haven hands him an envelope
he slips into his tunic without removing his gaze from

ILES
I see you finally got here
smiling

HAVEN
(pleasantly)
I seem to finally get everywhere

They eye each other Iles scowling Haven thinly
The sense of conflict is already between them

ILES
(introducing)
Mrs Caslon -- Mr Haven

She nods and smiles warmly

ILES
Youve met Mr Stellman

Haven nods

STELLMAN
It came off beautifully He picks a
very good fight In fact I think
Im still a little sore at him

ILES
(grunting)
Sit down Mr Haven

HAVEN
Thank you Captain

He sits down Iles is still studying Haven

ILES
So youre operating under sealed
orders

Haven nods agreeably

ILES
(disgruntled)
All this mumbo jumbo is characteristic
of the Military Information
Department

HAVEN
We use it as sparingly as possible

Iles pulls out a cigar lights it sizing Haven up

ILES
Ive been in this territory for a
number of years -- and I think it
might be a little rougher here than
a suburb of Washington DC

HAVEN
Very possibly

ILES
Then why is MID sending you out
here

HAVEN
Because two soldiers have been
murdered

ILES

And they think I cant handle that

HAVEN
They merely know you havent

There is a tight little silence while Iles formulates
his
dislike for this newcomer

ILES
I have only ninety-four men on the
post with Indian trouble up north
The War Department has refused to
send reinforcements or am I boring
you

HAVEN
(looking bored)
Im not the War Department

ILES
(explaining)
The two soldiers were killed while
escorting one of the gold stages

HAVEN
(quietly)
Is escorting gold a function of your
command

ILES
Young man the functions of my command
look very pretty on paper but theyre
not very practical in a territory
like this Do you have any illusions
about that
HAVEN
I have no illusions about anything

Haven takes out his pipe and fills it

HAVEN
Whats happening to the gold

ILES
Ive permitted it to be stored ina
warehouse on the post Now everybody
is waiting to see what I do next

HAVEN
What do you do next

ILES
(with sarcasm)
Arent you here to tell me

HAVEN

(lighting the pipe)
Captain youre in a bad way

(going over to discard

the match)
Wells Fargo wont convoy gold You
tried and failed and two men are
dead The gold is piling up on the
post and you cant move it Your
post is under-manned You want the
Quartermaster at Platte to replace
seventy uniforms sent to the freight
office at West Rim City --

ILES
The freight building burned down
with the uniforms Im not operating
a fire department -- and if I was
West Rim City is sixty miles away

HAVEN
That doesnt concern me either

ILES
What does

HAVEN
The killing of two soldiers

ILES
They were my men Haven and Im

though

criticize

smile in

rises

trying every way I know to find out
who murdered them

HAVEN
So will I

For the first time Iles looks amicably at him as
realizing that after all the man isnt there to
him
ILES

Youll find it harder than you think

I dont know how you operate but

its a dangerous job that can get

you killed
He smiles slightly at Iles who gives him a slight

return somehow intrigued by this nonchalance Haven

from the chair lighting the dead pipe in vain

HAVEN
Perhaps I can get some help from the
Sheriff

ILES

You can forget him Hes a miserable
man that somebody is using to keep
the law a joke

HAVEN
You make it sound very difficult
Why dont you just wrap up your flag
and take it back East with you

ILES
(smarting)
Tell me how will I know what youre
doing
HAVEN

Ill let you know from time to time

ILES
(coldly)
Thats very obliging of you

HAVEN
But I dont want to visit the Army
post

ILES
Then report to me through Mrs Caslon
here You can be a friend of her
husbands He owned the Argus mine
and died last year If that meets
your approval

Haven glances at Mrs Caslon smiles back at Iles

HAVEN
Only if it meets with hers

MRS CASLON
Id be delighted to help
(she smiles at Haven)

ILES
(grim at the smile)

Is that all

HAVEN
I think so

Iles marches out abruptly followed by Stellman The

door
shuts Haven smiles after him then at Mrs Caslon
MRS CASLON
He really isnt that abrupt -- he --
The door opens again smartly Iles marches back in
kisses

Mrs Caslon on the cheek

ILES
Goodnight Mary

MRS CASLON
(warmly)
Goodnight George

Then he marches out again shutting the door after him

MRS CASLON
You see

I see

MRS CASLON

She

I think he secretly likes you

HAVEN

Hes a man who can sure keep a secret

MRS CASLON
(smiles)
Would you like a little sherry

HAVEN
Only if you have some too

smiles as she brings him the wine

HAVEN
Thank you

MRS CASLON
To your good luck

Haven nods and they sip

HAVEN
What mine did the two soldiers try
to convoy the gold from

MRS CASLON
My mine -- The Argus

HAVEN
(smiling a little)

That brings me to a question I decided

not to ask

MRS CASLON
(smiling back at him)
Then Ill answer it first Captain
Iles has asked me to marry him

HAVEN
I can understand that

MRS CASLON
(quietly)
But you cant understand why Captain
Iles should be involved in the gold
business

Haven watches her

She goes over to a sideboard and pours a little from a
decanter into two wine glasses

For

first time he realizes she is a very attractive woman
HAVEN
(smiling)
I do now

MRS CASLON
It isnt just mine You must realize
theres a lot of gold from all over
the territory stored at the post
warehouse

How much

MRS CASLON
Perhaps as much as half a million
(worried now)
In fact I have about fifty thousand
in my safe now

HAVEN
Who is doing all this

MRS CASLON

I dont know thats the worst
part of it not knowing
HAVEN

(puts down the glass
pats her shoulder
with casual
reassurance)

I might find out

He starts for the door and she follows him At the open
door
he pauses

MRS CASLON
Dont get into trouble --

HAVEN
Thats why Im here

I know but --

Mick charges and Haven catches him full in the mouth
stops Mick and then Haven socks him again this time

surprised tasting the blood on his hurt lips

closes ponderously in on Haven his booted foot

blow on the inside of his thigh numbing the leg so

almost goes down And now Mick gets to him His great

close around Havens waist his hands locked in the

Havens back Haven braces himself against the crushing
squeeze tensing his back muscles and stiffening his

but there is nothing he can do against the implacable
power of the other man

The sweat stands out on Havens face as Micks great

bends him over farther and farther He must do

and soon or his back will be cracked like a barrel
Suddenly he bends his knees and lifts his feet up from
the ground Mick suddenly finding Havens full weight

him forward crashes down on top of him With all the
bruised

left in him Haven brings his knee to the pit of Micks
stomach as Micks hold breaks Haven rolls clear

Now they are both hurt Havens ribs and chest are so
that it is agony to take a breath He knows it has to
quickly or he is done for and he goes all out As Mick
to close with him again he stands his ground and
pile-driver punches to Micks midsection as Mick
lowers his arms to cover his body Haven shifts his

to the face This is not Micks style of fighting but

lashes back clumsily and angrily each time he touches

it is with punishing power Toe to toe they slug it
the belt now unwound and dangling from Micks fist
groggy but both refusing to go down Finally Mick is
to protect himself but Haven hasnt got power left to
him off those sturdy legs Gathering himself Haven
his body shoulder first at Micks chest but he
glances off and falls flat on his face As he rolls
dogged and slow with exhaustion he sees that his
staggered Mick the big man has taken a step back and
he starts to walk forward Dazed and blind with pain
passes Haven staggers forward until the tie-rail stops

There he stands his hands on the rail moving his head
side to side like a wounded animal

The crowd is silent now waiting Haven gets to his
drunk with weariness He puts a hand on Micks

hasnt the strength to whirl him around He braces

You cant do this
Before he is up he goes down again unable to make it
MICK
(in the dirt)
Nobody can do this to me

The crowd is transfixed They cant even cheer The two
bouncers lean over the fallen Mick

BOUNCER
Somebody just did

They pick up Mick as Haven stupidly watches Then as
turns and goes away swaying and weak the roar rises
pushes aside people who try to assist him They move
and watch him leave The crowd goes back in the saloon
the vanquished Mick
ANGLE on Charlie Bristow and Prince Prince watches
beaten Mick go by with a smile of contempt Charlies
are fixed on the vanishing lonely figure of Haven

INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Haven stands in the darkness only lighted by lights of
saloon next door He stands there looking vaguely out
window sucking his knuckles absently as he listens to
piano playing Then he goes wearily to the bed and

it gratefully shutting his eyes the towels still

his shoulder There is a moment of silence and then a
KNOCK at the door Another KNOCK and painfully Haven
himself on one elbow and drags out his gun The door
and Charlie enters She shuts it behind her and stands
at him He lets the gun fall and turns over on his
Charlie walks across to the bed and stands looking down
him

CHARLIE
How do you feel

HAVEN
Like a million dollars

CHARLIE
You just cost me a thousand You
lost your pipe in the fight I brought
it to you
She puts it on the table beside the bed Havens eyes

her She sees the towels takes them to the washstand

them and brings them back and compresses them gently on
Havens bruised face When she takes the towel away he
pulls

himself up a little propped against the pillow
looking at

her curiously She sits down on the edge of the bed

HAVEN
Do you always get sweet with the men
who fight over you

CHARLIE
Only the winners

He watches her as she wets the towels again returns
and

wraps his hands in them sitting again on the edge of
the

bed

HAVEN
Tell me something --

CHARLIE
(quietly smiling)
What

HAVEN
(he lies back)
That fellow might have killed me --
(sleepily)
Where do you bury the losers

He is almost asleep She takes the now unused towel and
puts

it back in the basin soaks it returns with it and
tucks it

against the side of his face

CHARLIE
You talk too much

HAVEN
(bitterly)
What do you want -- the next dance

CHARLIE
I think youd better sit this one

He is sound asleep the next second She stares at him

Iles is pacing the floor Mrs Caslon is occupied with
minor domestic chore Stellman is standing by the door

Of all the stupid bonehead plays
What did he fight about -- dont
tell me a woman

STELLMAN
Thats what they tell me

ILES
Who started it

STELLMAN
I dont know but Haven finished it

ILES
That probably strikes you as a very
admirable thing

Stellman shrugs

ILES
Well I dont think so I have men
who can use their fists Why didnt
they send a man who could use his
brains

There is a knock at the door Iles gives her a look

then
glares at Stellman
ILES
Well -- open it up
Stellman opens the door and Haven walks in He pauses
glances
around and smiles Mrs Caslon smiles at him

She smiles and nods Irons Haven can feel the
surcharged
air Deliberately he assumes that casual manner that so
burns

Captain Lieutenant
ILES
(coldly)

Mr Haven we may not have very much
around here that pleases you but we
do have a strict post regulation
against brawling in the town Now
would you like to explain what
happened last night

HAVEN
(smiling)
I came here to return Mrs Caslons
call

Iles glances sharply at Mrs Caslon and then to Haven

ILES
(indicating a chair)
Sit down

Haven sits wincing a little But he beams at Iles who

now
picks a book off the table

ILES
This book I have in my hand is the
Army Register 1882

Haven inspects his knuckles

ILES

I am now going to read from it

(finds the place

reads)
Haven John Martin born Ohio 1852
Appointed Second Lieutenant Promoted
First Lieutenant 20th Infantry March
1880 reduced in rank to 2nd
Lieutenant January 12 1881

He tosses the book on the table glaring at Haven

ILES
s that correct

HAVEN
ts the Army Register

ILES
Haven youve lost your rank once
t may very well happen again

HAVEN
To almost anybody

MRS CASLON
Maybe if youd let him explain He
might have a good reason

ILES
Even a bad reason would delight me

HAVEN
What would you like to know

ILES
Did you pick that fight

HAVEN
Those things can become very vague

Iles scowls to him

ILES
(shrewdly)
And where do you expect all this to
get you

HAVEN
(rising wearily)
That is a question I prefer not to
answer

ILES
(snaps it)
I think youre trying to carry your
authority too far

Haven goes to the door gently touching his sore jaw
At the
door he turns

HAVEN
Perhaps but theres one thing
Captain Iles We had an arrangement
that we wouldnt meet -- you and I --
except through Mrs Caslon I think
its important to keep it that way
(one more glance back)

She seems to enjoy Havens momentary confusion Prince
is

indifferent

HAVEN
Youre Charlie

CHARLIE
Thats right

HAVEN
You mean with his equipment

Prince gives him a thin smile and rises
PRINCE
She means either

Prince saunters out
Haven sits in a big chair very gingerly takes out his

pipe
and tobacco
HAVEN
You surround yourself with very
affable characters
CHARLIE
It makes me feel at home
HAVEN
Youre not that sinister Last night
with the wet towels you were Florence
Nightingale in silk stockings
(stretching his legs
looking at her)
Have you got a match
She comes over with one and lights his pipe
HAVEN
Theres one in my pocket but I hate
to reach for it thanks
She takes his hand and looks at the cut knuckle
CHARLIE
Sit there
She walks out of the room and he watches her then
around

the
front of him and sits down She has bandages and a
little
jar of ointment
HAVEN
(smiles)
Now youre Florence Nightingale again
She takes one of his bruised hands and as she bandages
his

hands slowly carefully and rather expertly they talk

CHARLIE
Why did you pick that fight

HAVEN
I thought you did
CHARLIE
(smiling)
Really

HAVEN
You could have insisted I was your
cousin

CHARLIE
Perhaps that isnt the way I felt
about you

Ouch

She stands up Haven looks at her and ignores his

bandaged
hands

Beautiful
CHARLIE

(walking towards the

window)

CHARLIE
And what will you do for it

HAVEN
Anything -- except hang How did you
get -- all this

CHARLIE

I learned one thing from my father
As long as men think they can beat
the tables all you have to do is
get a table Sometimes they run out
of cash and I find myself with new
responsibilities

HAVEN
Such as --

CHARLIE
A couple of stores for one thing

HAVEN
I cant see myself behind a counter
CHARLIE
A sawmill and a logging camp The
logging camps a long way from town

Haven gets the meaning and shakes his head

CHARLIE
I own the stage line from here to
West Rim City but thats a dud

Why

CHARLIE
Outlaws The money was in gold
shipments Now the mines wont ship
it

HAVEN
Ill take that job

running the stage line

HAVEN
A commission on all the gold I get
through

good
Only with money

HAVEN
Well the fact that they dont seem
to shoot too straight

Its a big favor and I wouldnt
blame you if you refused

MRS CASLON
What is it

but thats one reason why Im here --
to find cut what makes it impossible

MRS CASLON
Isnt that very risky

HAVEN
Thats why I couldnt go to anyone
but you

MRS CASLON
(hesitating)
Im just wondering if we shouldnt
speak to Captain Iles first

HAVEN
You know what hed say
(she smiles grimly

and nods)
Hed advise against it -- but if it
works my way it may clear everything
up -- for all of us -- and for Iles

too The War Department doesnt like
all that gold around an Army Post

He watches her face as she thinks it over

HAVEN
(softly)
Were working too much in the dark
This may be the only way to see
something Its a risk -- but someone
has to take it

MRS CASLON
(firmly)
Who else will know of it

HAVEN
Just us Thatll be all who know --
and thats the idea

MRS CASLON
(simply)
Ill arrange it

This is my favorite place in the

CHARLIE
The rook here and the stream The
stream is always running away and
the rock is always watching it go
Its two ways to be -- and I always
wonder which is the best

HAVEN
They probably envy each other

CHARLIE
Do you suppose any woman could envy
me

I know it

CHARLIE
But not a good woman

HAVEN
Nobody is any good You mean
respectable

(adds thoughtfully)
Shes certainly not hard to look at --
and now she has the money and is --
(looking away)

HAVEN
Then why would she be interested in
me

CHARLIE

Because youre no good And good
women like men who are bad for them

Flattery will get you nowhere

Fooling with her will get you nowhere
too -- except in trouble

uniform
In this interlude he changes to an icy man

MRS CASLON
Now dont excite yourself

ILES
I am very calm and I calmly ask you
how you could allow that scoundrel
to transport gold from your mine
when --

MRS CASLON
The man you call a scoundrel may be
dead at this moment
He

ILES
And he may be in town at this moment --
where in fact he is

How you could do this without telling
me --

MRS CASLON

US Government

ILES
Who do you think I represent

MRS CASLON
I told you George I was only trying
to help you

And while were on the subject who
does Mark Bristow represent

MRS CASLON
You know perfectly well that hes my
lawyer

About a gear box I failed to deliver

I dont know anything I merely --

PRINCE
Shut up

Mark relapses into a perspiring silence

HAVEN
(quietly)
Mark is right He doesnt know
anything He just knows what I
dictated to him in a deposition

CHARLIE
And what was that

HAVEN
It was just a story About a man who
got murdered a thief who got shot
and a gear box that got lost Probably
nobody would believe it --
(glancing up)
unless I got killed for it

whistling softly the tune that Charlie always sings At

couple of gunny sacks slung across his shoulder

Bottom of the gulley as Haven gets there and locates
crate at rest in a clump of brush The crate has broken
the fall Haven loads the buckskin bags of gold into
gunny sack and scrambles back up the slope

Side of slope as Haven scrambles to the top he finds
looking into a six-shooter held in the unwavering hand
Mrs Caslon Her eyes are hard and a grim smile plays
corners of her mouth

MRS CASLON
Drop it
Haven obeys

Turn around with your hands up

Haven turns She takes his gun and tosses it in the

wagon
then glances inside the sack sees the gold She backs
off a

You want to put it in the wagon

eyes)

he came Then stands back looking at her

Now was there something you wanted
to say

where they cached it I couldnt
haul it on horseback so I came here

get you hanged

fury
BRISTOW
Dont you laugh at me I ought to

They want you to Mark
Haven again leans on one elbow looking at Mark and the
trembling hand that holds the gun
HAVEN
And it may be your only out if you

Because even if you took them my
scalp it wouldnt buy your life
Youre in debt and youre broke and

As Haven enters SHOOTING FROM his ANGLE we can see
does Mark crossing the street apparently towards his
office He is in such a hurry that he falls down

little gets up runs Just as he reaches the office

just as his hand touches the knob a shot rings out and

crumples He still tries then his hand slips from the
and he lies there dead The vacant street is empty with

death Haven stares He takes a match from the counter
applies it to his pipe -- then finding the pipe empty

thinly and pockets it

HAVEN
(softly turning to
the clerk)
You didnt throw away that verse

were ready to wear them

ILES
Wear them What for

HAVEN
What other reason To get in the

Iles gawks at him

HAVEN
You were taking a detachment up north
on an Indian scare

Iles nods vaguely

HAVEN
Well that scare is a fake A ruse
So you know where to send them now

ILES
Look here Lieutenant --

Correction

Haven dips into a lining pocket under his arm and
paper at Iles Iles glances at it then looks
at Haven

ILES
Major
You better get down to that sawmill
Captain They may try it anyway

ILES expression slowly changes He smiles at last

ILES
I guess I owe you an apology

Ill take it

He shakes hands with Iles for second then Iles goes

out
abruptly Outside we can hear abrupt commands to the
Sergeant

at

slightly
She gets her voice at last

the angle on Haven up the stairs is no good He lowers

down gently on the couch

ANGLE on couch as Haven kneels beside her He starts to

away the top of her dress but the wound is close to

her)

Well -- say it
