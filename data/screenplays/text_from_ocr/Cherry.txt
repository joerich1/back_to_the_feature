Based on the novel CHERRY by Nico Walker
CHYRON -- PROLOGUE 2007
A MALE VOICE with the soft lilt and tone of a mumble poet
MALE VOICE (VO)
This movie is a work of fiction These
things didn’t ever happen These people
didn’t ever exist
FADE IN
EXT CHERRY AND EMILYS HOUSE - MORNING
DRONE SHOT OF CLEVELAND OHIO--
FIND A RESIDENTIAL STREET Two-story wood and brick homes Small
front yards If not for the BLACK 70’s SEDAN that screams “drug

dealer” parked in the road it would look like a Norman Rockwell
painting

MALE VOICE (VO)
Emily and I live on a street of homes with
front porches where we don’t belong

FIND ONE HOUSE IN PARTICULAR A quintessential starter home
though it has seen some wear these past few years The owner of
the voice exits the side door-- let’s call him CHERRY CHERRY (VO)
But we’re happy enough though we’re often
sad because we feel like we’re losing
everything

LAND ON CHERRYS FACE Brown guileless eyes peek out from dark
hair acertain resolve written in his visage AND OFF THIS--

INSERT FLASHBACK LIVING ROOM DAY--

EMILY big dark eyes and thrift store duds SCREAMS from
the bowels of unknowable pain

CHERRY (VO)
Sometimes Emily gets to carrying on real
loud and screaming at me about shit like I
can help it

REVEAL Cherry hopping up and down beside her like the floor was
hot coals

CHERRY
What the fuck is wrong with you Are you
fucking crazy Why are you making all this
noise like you’re being murdered Are you
being murdered Am I murdering you

REVEAL Livinia their dog HOWLING Emily SCREAMS LOUDER Cherry
freaks out more--

CHERRY (CONTD)
The neighbors will think I’m murdering you
And they’1l call the fucking police And
the police’1l come over here and they’11l
see me and they’ll say “This guy looks
like the guy who’s been doing all this
shit” And then I’1ll go to fucking prison
and youll feel terrible

Emily stops crying now

CHERRY (VO)
And sometimes she says--

EMILY
--I’m sorry

CHERRY (VO)
And sometimes she doesn’t say anything

IN THE BATHROOM ON ANOTHER DAY

Cherry shuts the medicine cabinet FINDS Emily standing behind
him in the mirror nostrils flared

CHERRY
(startled)
Jesus Christ

CHERRY (VO)
Or sometimes she punches me in the neck

IN THE KITCHEN ON ANOTHER DAY

Cherry pours milk into his cereal when Emily suddenly PUNCHES
him in the neck

CHERRY
Ah Ahh shit Baby why’d you punch me in
the neck
Livinia licks the spilled milk
CHERRY (VO)
And then she’1ll run upstairs and lock

herself in the bathroom--

FOLLOW EMILY upstairs where she slams the bathroom door
CHERRY (VO)
--and not come out for hours while I’m
crying my eyes out over her

PAN DOWN TO FIND CHERRY lying on the floor outside the bathroom
door sobbing hysterically

HE SPEAKS ALOUD NOW AS IF “TO US”--

CHERRY (TO US)
I love her so much it feels like dying
every time she does that She’s a beauty
and I tell her all the time--

CHERRY (CONTD)
(calling through the door)
--You’re a beauty Em

CHERRY (TO US) (CONTD)
I think she’d do anything for me

BACK TO OUTSIDE THE HOUSE
Cherry gets into his Dodge and pulls out the driveway--
FOLLOWING HIM THAT 70’S SEDAN ALL BLACK WITH BLACKED-OUT

WINDOWS Cherry turns left on Cedar the landscapes glimpsed
through his windshield shifting to reveal--

QUICK CUTS OF A CITY PASSING BY A pharmacy an abandoned KFC
the movie theater Wendy’s another pharmacy

CHERRY (TO US)
I’m twenty-three years old and I still
don’t understand what it is people do

ON CHERRY considering it all--

CHERRY (CONTD)
It’s as if all this were built on nothing
and nothing were holding this together And
then I hear people talk and that just makes
things worse

EXT HAMPSHIRE BLVD - MOMENTS LATER

Cherry gets out of the car on the picturesque street and walks
down the sidewalk DRONE SHOT of mature trees pre-war apartment
buildings-—-

CHERRY (TO US)
Some of the apartments here have balconies
And the trees are nice

(MORE)
CHERRY (TO US) (CONTD)
I don’t understand them either but I like
them I think I’d like them all

CHERRY considers the trees getting lost in thought And it’s
here that we start to realize he may not be fully in his right
Mind Maybe he’s on something Maybe he’s just tortured by
rumination Maybe both Finally he settles on--

CHERRY (TO US) (CONTD)
It’d have to be a pretty fucked up tree for
me not to like it

VFX BEAUTIFUL IMAGES surrounding him begin to SATURATE WITH
COLOR one ata time Some are obvious (the swaying trees

vibrant grass overcast sunlight) some not so obvious (the

abstract expressionism of dirt stained on a car power lines
criss-crossing like poetry cracks in the pavement weaving a
delicate tapestry)

CHERRY (TO US) (CONTD)
It’s not that Im dumb to the beauty of
things I take all the beautiful things to
heart and they fuck my heart till I about
die from it

Cherry reaches the 70’s Sedan The tinted window slowly rolls
down to REVEAL--

BLACK -- A WEST-SIDE DRUG DEALER WITH A BLACK HOLE FOR A FACE

CHERRY (CONTD)
I’1ll be quick You know where you’re going
right
Black half nods
CHERRY (CONTD)
Just make the first left three times and
you can’t go wrong
Black nods again
CHERRY (CONTD)
I’11l meet you in the parking lot in two
minutes give or take

MOMENTS LATER

Cherry walks calmly down the street now low profile
CHERRY (TO US)
I’m in a baseball hat and a red scarf with
a blue hoodie white button down shirt
some jeans white Adidas nothing out of
the ordinary

He turns the corner and arrives at the main drag coffee shops
and restaurants and pharmacies and-- banks

CHERRY (TO US) (CONTD)
--The scarf covers the lower half of my
face It’s a little late for it to do any
good I’ve been at this awhile now and
it’s no secret what my face looks like

Arriving at a CREDIT NONE bank on the corner Cherry pauses
exhales Steadying himself

CHERRY (CONTD)
The gun is in my waist I pull the scarf
up before I go--

HE ENTERS THE FOYER
Cherry scarf up looks to a SECURITY CAMERA and we CUT TO--

VIDEO FOOTAGE OF CHERRY VIA THE CAMERA VARIOUS DIFFERENT BANK-
ROBBING CHERRYS-- all in different garb from different days and
all looking up at the lens

BACK ON CHERRY as he opens the door pulling his gun from his
waistband--

CHERRY (TO US) (CONTD)
I’m through the door and I have my gun out
so everyone can see

INT CREDIT NONE - CONTINUOUS

CHERRY
NO ALARMS I’M A WANTED MAN THEY’LL KILL
ME

FREEZE-FRAME ON CHERRY his face crazed UNFREEZE--

CHERRY (TO US) (CONTD)
I have a lot of sadness in the face to make
up for so I have to act like I’m crazy or
else people will think I’m a pussy

The few patrons shudder with fear as Cherry approaches the YOUNG
FEMALE TELLER
CHERRY (TO US) (CONTD)
One thing about holding up banks is that
youre mostly robbing women so you don’t
ever want to be rude
(then to the teller)
It’s nothing personal I’m sorry

YOUNG FEMALE TELLER
(nervous )
That’s okay

CHERRY
What’s your name

YOUNG FEMALE TELLER
Vanessa

CHERRY
I’m sorry Vanessa

YOUNG FEMALE
TELLERVANESSA
What’s your name

CHERRY
Youre funny Vanessa

As Vanessa quickly empties out cash drawers--

CHERRY (TO US) (CONTD)
About 80 of the time so as long as youre
not rude the women don’t mind when you
hold up the bank probably breaks up the
monotony for them Of course there are
exceptions

INSERT FLASHBACK WESTSIDE CREDIT NONE
Cherry robs a WOMAN WHO LOOKS LIKE JANET RENO

CHERRY (VO)
Like there was this one lady on the
Westside looked like Janet Reno wouldn’t
go above--

WOMAN WHO LOOKS LIKE JANET
RENO
--Eighteen hundred dollars

Cherry stares at her clearly not having it She shrugs
WOMAN WHO LOOKS LIKE JANET

RENO (CONTD)
That’s as high as I go
CHERRY
You mean to tell me you’d see everybody
here dead before you come off another cent

Janet stares at him unmoved Cherry shakes his head and takes
the 1800 depressed as all hell

CHERRY (VO)
She actually thought the bank was right
But this was a fanatic

BACK TO CREDIT NONE
Vanessa places stacks of money on the counter

CHERRY (TO US)
Usually it’s very civilized

Cherry takes the cash He and Vanessa lock eyes as-- ALL THE
PEOPLE IN THE BANK SINK INTO DARKNESS as if Cherry and Vanessa

are under a SPOTLIGHT on a theater stage

CAMERA SPINS AROUND VANESSA TO LAND ON CHERRYS FACE as he
takes her in

CHERRY (TO US) (CONTD)
I think maybe we’re the same age I could
be in love with her if things had been
different

Then as Cherry disappears to darkness WE TRANSITION OFF THE
BACK OF VANESSAS HEAD TO--

INT JESUIT COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY

THE BACK OF ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN sitting in the front row of a
CLASSROOM

CHYRON -- PART ONE WHEN LIFE WAS BEGINNING I SAW YOU 2002

CHERRY (VO)
When I first saw Emily I was attending one
of the local universities the one with the
Jesuits a decent school

The young woman EMILY (at 18 years old) turns to look at us
She wears a thin WHITE RIBBON around her neck

REVERSE TO REVEAL Cherry (also 18) watching her through a mop
of strawberry-blonde hair a few rows back He has his iPod
headphones in LISTENING TO THE SCORE OF THE FILM
CHERRY (VO)

And I don’t want to tell lies The first
thing I thought was “Id like to have sex
with that girl”

A PROFESSOR running an overhead projector near Cherry
approaches him The MUSIC CUTS as the Professor yanks his
headphones out--

PROFESSOR
Can we at least pretend to care

Cherry stands ignoring this Professor Grabs his book-bag and
walks down the riser stairs as--

CHERRY (TO US)

I shouldn’t have even been there Just my
folks had enough money so it was
expected

As Cherry exits the classroom a DIOPTER WIPES FRAME
TRANSPORTING HIM TO--

INT CHERRY’S CHILDHOOD HOME DINING ROOM - DAY

Where his MOM and DAD eat steak dinners Cherry puts his book
bag down to sit at the table with them

VFX Throughout the film CHERRY’S DAD APPEARS AS A SHADOW OF A

MAN-- as if he is present but not really A cigarette dangles
from his lips

CHERRYS MOMS own lips are slightly overdrawn with lip liner--

CHERRY’S MOM
How is school

CHERRY
Good We’re reading The Canterbury Tales

CHERRY’S MOM
The Canterbury Tales Id have liked to
have gone to college and read The
Canterbury Tales That sounds wonderful
The Canterbury Tales Id like to have read
all the books and talked about them But me
and your Dad we didn’t get to do that

CHERRYS DAD
We had to work

ON CHERRY troubled by this when his Mom reaches out and
squeezes his hand wanting desperately to know--
CHERRY’S MOM
Why aren’t you happy honey You never seem

happy

Her eyes press him for an answer as she takes a long sip of her
wine Cherry just stares at her as if a Greek tragedy were
playing out before him and it’s too much to bear The lights in
the dining room THEATRICALLY DIM--

CHERRY (TO US)
And she was right I wasn’t happy Problem
was I didn’t know why I mean I tried to
be good I didn’t even eat meat-—-

INSERT CHERRY’S PLATE A bare veggie burger patty baked potato
and broccoli

BACK ON a depressed Cherry--
CHERRY (TO US) (CONTD)
All I could figure was the world was wrong
and I was in it

EXT JESUIT COLLEGE - DAY

FOLLOW CHERRY (with headphones in LISTENING TO THE SCORE
AGAIN) He walks across the quad as--

The world around him seems to move at a SLIGHTLY MORE ELEVATED
SPEED as if he can’t keep up

A FOOT playfully kicks him in the ass Cherry pulls the
headphones out the MUSIC ABRUPTLY CUTTING OFF Turns around to
find Emily laughing--

EMILY
I called your name like ten times

CHERRY
(embarrassed)
My music’s loud

EMILY

given to melancholy Not entirely
guileless

the dough in the air and all that

A petite elderly man enters wearing a petite suit This is OLD
MAN FATOOK He watches Cherry less than amused

CHERRY (VO)
He had a slight frame and he wore a little
grey suit so he looked like a puppet I saw
him and I thought “Oh here comes a nice
old man”

OLD MAN FATOOK
(to Cherry)
Come on Let me see you do it

Cherry tries again but he doesn’t get much spin on it and the
dough comes down roughly in the same shape it was

CHERRY (VO)
There had been an all-encompassing sadness
in its trajectory I didn’t have the magic

MOMENTS LATER

North gets out of the Humvee as Cherry and Cheetah approach
Cherry climbs in tension rising He grabs the handset clipping
it to him when--

BOOM THIS IS THE LOUDEST EXPLOSION

Cherry spins around in his seat-- And for one moment there is
aneerie sense of quiet No sound at all and it’s another
moment before Cherry knows if he’s even alive and then he
realizes

The Humvee with his friends has hit an IED and is now dust

FOLLOW CHERRY GETTING OUT OF HIS HUMVEE AND RUNNING STRAIGHT
TOWARD THE CHAOS

North is heard shouting after him--

SERGEANT NORTH (0S)
Dont fucking run into it

But a force beyond Cherrys control is sending him head-first
INTO THE FIRE overwhelmed by--

Body parts scattered on the ground The imprint of a face melted
to a window All the faces are burned off actually there are
no faces left Cherry takes in each horror as TIME SLOWS--

CHERRY (VO)
The smell is something you already know
It’s coded in your blood The smoke gets
into every pore and every gland your mouth
full of it to where you may as well be
eating it

A SERIES OF CUTS Cherry running back and forth from the
culvert to the burning Humvee his helmet full with water and
it’s not occurring to him that this is useless since everyone
is fucking dead already

MOMENTS LATER

-- CUT TO other soldiers arriving now joining in to help him
using helmets ammo cans whatever

LATER
The Captain arrives taking the scene in his eyes landing on--

CHERRY standing immobile where the fire once burned He’s
looking up at Bautista who’s on the platform under the turret--
A burned-up skull with empty sockets teeth clenched

The Captain approaches Cherry with gentle tact--

CAPTAIN
Private

CHERRY
(beat)
That’s Bautista He was the gunner

The Captain gives Cherry a look as if to say help me get him

And together they pick up Bautistas CORPSE-- Cherry has it by
the top half and the Captain has it by the legs The black
muscle tissue is scalding slick Cherry lets go his hands
searing--

CHERRY (CONTD)
Shit my gloves are melting-- I’m sorry
Captain--

--he rips the gloves off hands trembling

The Captain acutely aware that Cherry is on the verge of
falling to pieces--

CAPTAIN
It’s alright Try hooking your arms
instead

Cherry nods and they hoist the corpse up again Cherry hooking
his arms under Yuri’s this time
A SERIES OF CUTS Cherry and the Captain carrying Bautista
Bautista set down in a body bag Bautista zipped up inside--

Gone

Cherry notices Cheetah watching shaken

CHERRY
That was Bautista
CHEETAH
I think there’s some more of him still in

the truck

TIGHT ON CHERRY scraping a piece of Bautista off the seared
seat He doesn’t know what to do so he throws it in the water

CUT TO CHERRY Staring at Lessings melted face stuck to the
front windshield He says to the Captain

CHERRY
That one was Lessing

Then he notices SOMETHING on the ground next to him STAY ON
CHERRY’S FACE as he considers it his jaw tensing

CHERRY (CONTD)
(to the Captain)
This one’s Jiminez

REVEAL A LEFT HAND lying on the ground severed from the rest of

its body-- Jiminezs gold WEDDING RING still in place
underneath

I like to hear myself talk I tell you
these things ‘cause I want to help you And

Cherry is practically out of his mind now He turns to walk
away North screaming after him--

STAFF SERGEANT NORTH

(Cherry ignores him)
None of it matters if youre dead too

ON CHERRY

Blood-drenched wind and sand whipping him He stumbles off
alone into the DESERT VOID Before collapsing exhausted no
longer making sense in the world--

INT HUMVEE DRIVING ENTERING THE FOB CHECK POINT

A vacant Cherry rides covered in blood and dust Cheetah drives

Jolted the Young Medic scrambles out into the gunfire helps
Cherry load up the Screaming Soldier Together they run the
litter back out of the village to the landing CASEVAC

ON CHERRY as they run taking in the anguished Soldiers face--

CHERRY (VO)
Truth was I wasnt some hard

REVERSE TO CHERRY’S POV The Soldier no longer looks like a

human being to him but a MANNEQUIN instead (just like the ones
Cherry worked with in training)

CHERRY (VO)
I was just some guy who couldnt give a
shit anymore And just so happened not to
get shot

They load the litter onto the chopper and the Young Medic bowls
over vomiting into the dust

more wounded as if on auto-pilot DISAPPEARING INTO THE SMOKE

PRELAP DISCO MUSIC--

to go running into gymnasiums about

CUT TO THE SOLDIERS BACK IN FORMATION NOW Hightower signals
their DISMISSAL as they each begin moving towards the bleachers
searching the hoards of family members who rush out onto the
gymnasium floor to reunite with their loved ones

CHERRY (VO)
My one true accomplishment was not dying--
and really I had nothing to do with it

Just then Emily reaches Cherry wrapping her arms around his
body for the first time in an eternity feeling the warmth of
his face with her hands searching his eyes as--

Cherry tears up all of the emotion he has stuffed down for so
long finally able to surface

And as the two of them stand there holding one another--

BLACK SCREEN CHYRON Three weeks later
INT US PRANK - DAY

Cherry with a buzz-cut and a mustache waits in line at the
bank overcome with dope sickness

CHERRY (VO)
The essential problem of being hooked on
dope is that whenever you get flush you
spend it on dope Until the money’s gone
And then when the dope’s gone you get
sick

Just then he throws up in his shirt

CHERRY (VO)
At which point you need to find more money

A WOMAN IN LINE turns around disturbed--

I think you’re really sick

CHERRY
No no I’m fine I just can’t stop
sneezing--

He vomits into his shirt again His mustache revealed to be a
FAKE as it is now starting to fall off

CHERRY (VO)
I don’t imagine that anyone goes in for
robbery if they are not in some kind of
desperation With robbery it’s a matter of
pure abasement

JUMP TO Cherry sliding a note to the TELLER She reads it and
looks at him almost saddened Starts emptying her drawer

Cherry ready to collapse takes the cash off the counter and

until he finds a guilty MANAGER standing near the back
beelines to him gun still aimed--

EXT CREDIT NONE - MOMENTS LATER

THE ALARM BLARES Cherry walks out of the bank oddly serene He
walks over to Black’s waiting Sedan and opens the back door
Tosses the money in and then closes it again walking off down
the street A beat and Blacks Sedan pulls off

ON CHERRY looking around as he goes The apartments with
balconies the trees-- the beautiful fucking trees

CHERRY (VO)
The morning was overcast but it was bright
nonetheless-- a bright overcast morning In
just-spring

The sounds of SIRENS rise from a few blocks away
Cherry stops getting down to his knees now
CHERRY (VO)
This is the beauty of things fucking my
heart I wish I could lie down on the grass
in the sun for a while But it’s a childish

thing to wish for

The SIRENS grow louder and Cherry pulls a syringe from his
pocket

CHERRY (VO)
But here come the sirens Here come their
fucking gangsters-—-—

The SIRENS deafening now closing in on him He shoots up the
sun shining down on his face

CHERRY (VO)
The sirens screaming now now turning--

Police cars approach from behind as Cherry falls back to the
concrete his head landing just next to the green grass Feeling
the rush of his high

CHERRY (VO)
And I feel peaceful

A hollowed out Cherry (STILL 23) now in uniform is led to
his cell through a crowded common area

IN A PRISON CELL NIGHT

An insomnia laden Cherry sits on his bunk hunched against the
wall unable to sleep

IN THE PRISON YARD

Cherry sits in the prison yard bundled up in his INDUSTRIAL
PRISON JACKET Smoking a cigarette with headphones in LISTENING
TO THE FILM’S SCORE THAT HAS BEEN PLAYING

He takes in the world around him when-- He pulls the headphones
out the MUSIC ABRUPTLY CUTTING OFF THE CAMERA STOPPING

A long beat as he sits there really hearing the quiet of the
morning reflecting on the choice hes made

Then as the MUSIC and CAMERA start up again--
A SUPPORT MEETING

Cherry enters a support meeting for the first time Awkwardly
finds a seat

IN THE LATRINE

(NOTE CHERRY IS NOW 26)

sandwiched in-between the other inmates a sense of normalcy to
it all

others

Cherry brushes his teeth again

IN A PAROLE HEARING

(NOTE CHERRY IS NOW 33)

Cherry visibly more than a decade older sits anxiously before
the THREE MEMBERS OF THE PAROLE BOARD

PAROLE COMMISSIONER
These were serious crimes and you
deserved to go to prison for the minimum 10
years You have no prior history of
criminal activity You have complied with
prison regulations and rules You have
programmed in an acceptable manner
Considering these factors you are deemed
low-risk to reoffend Therefore it is our
vote to grant your parole effective
immediately This decision although
difficult is fair and just

THE CAMERA STOPS ON CHERRY as he smiles tearing up
IN CHERRY’S CELL AGAIN
(NOTE THE CAMERA IS NO LONGER MOVING LEFT TO RIGHT)

Cherry reads alone on his bunk clean shaven and with a fresh
haircut

GUARD (0S)
Hey Cleveland--

Cherry looks to the GUARD standing in his cell door
