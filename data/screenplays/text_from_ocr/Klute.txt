Grunemann smiling back at her We cut back to a
closeup of Mrs Grunemann looking back at her

(holding a report) TRASK a New York detective
Cable and the plant director STREIGER

ROSS
-- has disclosed no evidence of
crime or criminal intent within the
jurisdiction of this bureau and
since subject Thom --

CABLE
(turns sharply
interrupts)
Its been almost a year Tom
Grunemanns been missing for a
year And all the FBI has to offer
is a report that must bore even

you
ROSS
(restraint)
Well sir
STREIGER

Are you closing the case

ROSS
No sir we dont state that Were
countin --

CABLE
But you dont find it worth much
effort

ROSS

(injured dignity)
Well Mr Cable youve got me here
from the Bureau You got Lieutenant
Trask here from New York
representing his department and I
dont frankly consider --

STREIGER
(moderating suggesting)
Why couldnt you ever find out
anything from the girl

ROSS
(refers the question)

Trask --

TRASK
(summarizes from notes)
We first hold her under
surveillance expectin your boy
Grunemann to show up there Didnt
Then we bagged -- we arrested her
on a CP charge convicted two
months womens city prison offer
to reduce sentence she cooperated

(counts)

Four interrogations She thought
she remembered Grunemann -- from
those letters from before she made
that connection -- but she hadnt
seen him since and couldnt
identify his photograph and she --

STREIGER
Why not

TRASK

Oh a good call girl shell turn
six-seven hundred tricks a year
The faces get blurred

(resumes)

And since then recent months
shes reported several you know
incidents like breather calls
anonymous phone calls also
somebody maybe following her
watching her things like that So

conceivable Grunemanns still
around there just hangin around
her spooking her But you know
that --

He shakes his head gestures doubtingly Ross caps
it

ROSS
The subject got emotionallv
disturbed he just dropped out
Theres thousands

STREIGER

position ours is a little
different We have an investment in
Tom Grunemann The Company has an
investment and we feel entitled to
investigate for ourselves

ROSS
Private investigation you mean
Yes sir of course youre entitled
and theres some very competent --
STREIGER
Klute offered us his services
weve accepted

Pause Ross and Trask look at Klute - more than a
bit startled - then at each other Klute just looks
uneasy

STREIGER (CONTD)
Klute knew Tom He has a great many
ideas about the case --

ROSS
(sourly)
Yes sir we know he --

STREIGER

TRASK

unusually strong personality some
ways high intelligence a high
bracket call girl

EXT WOMENS PRISON ROOF - CAGED IN RECREATION AREA

SPANGLER a prison psychiatrist sits on a bench
eating a sandwich partially wrapped in wax paper
and sipping from a carton of milk He is obviously
a man pressed for time KLUTE sits beside him
Across from them some prisoners are taking their
exercise Through the metallic netting that
surrounds them we see the skyline of New York
City It only dramatizes more the sense of being
caged

SPANGLER

-- Usual case history -- this isnt
a medical confidence its all of
them -- broken family lonely
confused crummy childhood early
promiscuity formal prostitution
beginning in her teens income
twenty-five to thirty thousand a
year

(notes Klutes reaction)
Oh they dont keep the money they
get rid of it they get pimps Why

(stabs at record)
Why do you want to know all this

KLUTE
I want to know how Tom Grunemann
got mixed up in it

SPANGLER
Not unusua

KLUTE
Did she talk about him to you

SPANGLER
About his letters -- thats all she
remembered Quite violent material

Id say obsessive a quite sick
man But thats not unusual either

KLUTE
Has she talked with you since
prison

SPANGLER
No She had every good intention of
it -- coming to me as a private
patient getting out of the life
devoting herself to an acting
career

KLUTE
I think shes trying that

SPANGLER
Oh sure they try The idea of a
better life But they dont really
know much about life They get
confused -- or scared or frustrated
or bored -- they pop back to the
one thing they can handle
The trick The trick Men in bed
Not men in general not life not
love not even real sex -- it
avoids all that Just the trick
the transaction

He pours a glass of wine for her for himself She
speaks with a neat continental accent -- doing it
fairly well really -- a member of the
international set

BREE
Oh thank you

He sits in the chair opposite sips his wine

MR FABER

Well --
BREE
(diffident)

MR FABER

BREE
Well -- well Im just back And --
I must tell you -- something quite

wonderful

MR FABER
(intently)
Yes

BREE
And Cannes was quite fun quite
and we played baccarat and
chemindefer and there was a nice
little Italian marquis quite
enthusiastic for me -- but a young
man can be so silly --

MR FABER
Mm

BREE
And then one night -- at the gaming
tables -- well I just saw him A
stranger -- looking at me -- and I
knew suddenly that all my life Id
been --

She hesitates strangely her fingers at the neck of
the cape Faintly --

BREE (CONTD)
-- May I Its so --

MR FABER
(quickly)

Please --

She stands unloosing the cloak letting it fall on

the couch But she doesnt sit again -- begins to
move here and there about the enclosure her hands
wandering about her dress and body -- an erotic
restlessness
BREE
Not young he wasnt young -- gray
at the temples he -- well actually

he looked like you

MR FABER
(tensely)
Yes

BREE
And nobody could tell me who he was
-- an exiled prince or a mercenary
or a bullfighter or -- but I felt
it stirring inside me this -- this
wild pagan feeling --

EXT GARMENT BUILDING DOOR - NIGHT

KLUTE arrives from across the street It takes him
a while (with a loid probably) to slip the lock
He eases door open moves inside --

INT CORNER OF CUTTING ROOM BREE - NIGHT

BREE is farther along in her narrative more
fervent in manner MR FABER sits at the edge of
his seat ducking his head now and then in
pleasure but making no move to molest her

BREE
And next day at the beach -- our
beach pavilion -- I saw him again

his eyes burning into me I was
helpless Without his even speaking
to me without his even touching I
knew that somehow -- somehow --

She casts away an accessory garment Mr Faber
burns her with his eyes --

INT GARMENT BUILDING - CUTTING ROOMS - NIGHT

KLUTE mounts into view at the head of the stairs
prowls along the aisles of clothing looking --
sees -—-

POV PAST GARMENT RACKS TO MR FABER

Klute sees Mr Faber first -- clearly a senior
citizen -- sitting transfixed fastened in some
private dream Then BREE drifts into view -- stands
-- lets fall the evening dress about her ankles
poses -- drifts out of view again --

KLUTE

Klute watches in that direction a moment longer In
his expression a certain curiosity -- a prurience --
but rather more strongly disappointment a measure
of disgust Not his affair He turns away from it
into camera and --

EXT BREES BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

Near the entrance outside the door to KLUTEs
apartment below We open on BREE She shouts
angrily miserably --

BREE
Whynt you just cut out

We WIDEN TO INCLUDE KLUTE Now she begins to get

comes slowly down steps
INT KLUTES ROOM - DAY

She steps in the door looks slowly around at his
various appurtenances -- the bed the necktie over
the mirror etc -- and then the TAPE RECORDER and
then the STACK OF TAPE BOXES Softly venomously --

BREE
Oh you bastard

But then she adjusts -- a frightened but matter-of
fact hooker --

BREE (CONTD)

KLUTE

KLUTE

Could I ask some questions

BREE
Or youll get me shoved back in the
brig you mean another month with

She seems to have expressed it the balance of
power She turns goes out heads upstairs Klute
unhurriedly takes up his folder of notes then
follows

INT BREES APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bree disposes her belongings Klute moves to table
There is a group of plants on the table that long
since died of neglect He notices them and the
disorganization of the room without comment opens
his folder rummages for the photographs Then
exasperatedly --

BREE
Look I told the police everything
I dont even remember the schlub

Klute doesnt respond Klute sets out a photograph
for her to look at
INSERT PHOTOGRAPH TOM GRUNEMANN

questioningly

KLUTE

Well it could be any one of them
bubi I get to see them all

She separates from Klute around the table (but
remains standing restless) Klute puts photo
aside prepares to take notes as she pleads --
BREE (CONTD)
Look -- please -- will you just try
to get it from my side A year ago
I was in the life fulltime I was
living on Park with leather
furniture and a million dresses
Then they dropped on me the fuzz
they caged me -- they started
asking me about a man some man

before that Two years ago two He
could be in Yemen

She waits for Klute to respond -- he doodles
permissively on his pad of paper -- she goes on

BREE (CONTD)
A name Grunemann Nothing And
they showed me pictures like this
and they meant nothing Then they
asked me well had I been getting
letters from someone out there in

Cabbageville --

was that dumper once he sounded
like that dumper --

(explains)
Dumpers they get their kicks

Without warning she wheels to the open windows
shouts out full-voiced -- both startling and
somewhat intriguing Klute --

BREE (CONTD)

KLUTE
But you cant say that Dumper was
Tom Grunemann

BREE

A brief pause Klute sorts his notes She may take
it that hes packing to leave -- hopes so anyhow
For an instant we see the undefended girl
underneath --

BREE (CONTD)
So -- OK -- thats all

Then again she changes manner -- remembering a
practical problem approaching it as a matter-of
fact hooker

BREE (CONTD)
Well could I have them back now
hon -- those tape recordings
youve got downstairs -- OK -- and
if you want you can have a good
time and Ill have a good time and--

KLUTE

reasonably on top of things Starting now we see
her driven toward the things shed really rather
not talk about -- and increasingly more shaken

KLUTE (CONTD)

Tom Grunemann disappeared The
phone calls and the --

BREE

BREE
(trembling)

cautions her She falls silent as suddenly as she
began Then cheerfully --

BREE
Gee I hope this doesnt make my

KLUTE

BREE
(casual pleasant)
Mm Oh he was my old man We broke
up

She wanders away toward a bureau Her shirt seems
to itch her she scratches her ribs Then opens
drawer takes out a different shirt as --

KLUTE
When
(beat)
When did you and Ligourin break up

She pulls off her shirt unhooks her brassiere and
discards it apparently quite unselfconscious
Klute reacts then carefully maintaining his cool

KLUTE (CONTD)
Mind not doing that

She turns to him in total innocence holding the
shirt rather carelessly in front of her -- a new
attack

BREE
What This

KLUTE
-- OK

BREE
(ingenuously)
I thought you could trick me for
those tapes Dont you get lonely
in that little green room Or let
me get you someone I have terrific
friends wild

KLUTE
No thanks

At this point -- or about this point -- Klute takes
note of something A little above her He grows
more watchful but containing it carefully We
dont understand the change in his manner -- or
even notice she doesnt In mock dismay --

BREE
Gee Ive had men pay two hundred
dollars for me -- here youre
turning down a freebie
(pause)
You can get a perfectly good
dishwasher for that

He has risen is approaching her slowly -- carrying
his notes as if to check something She is hopeful
again --

BREE (CONTD)
Youve changed your mind You do
want to play

KLUTE
(quietly steadily)
I dont want you to look up
Theres someone on the skylight

She gasps terrified -- immediately -- almost
beyond control He taps the pencil on his notes

KLUTE (CONTD)
Easy -- pretend youre looking here-
(more insistently)
-- here

She manages to take hold of a corner of the notes
trembling He goes on --

KLUTE (CONTD)
Now Im going to walk around -- you
just keep talking straight
through straight through

He strolls away from her His destination is the

area of the door -- out of view from the skylight --
from where he can head for the roof But he doesnt
head that way directly -- first takes a turn in

another direction his bearing casual Prompting --

KLUTE (CONTD)

Tell me about acting -- what are

I go on rounds

KLUTE
Rounds what are they -- dont
watch me keep talking

BREE

labors on --

abandoned building

INT STAIRWELL - ABANDONED BUILDING

CAMERA follows KLUTE as he cautiously makes his way
down the stairwell of the boarded up old
brownstone He gets to the first floor He can see
no exit in the building He opens door that leads
to a narrow staircase into the cellar

INT CELLAR - ABANDONED BROWNSTONE

It is as black as a dungeon and as low He lights a
match but sees no one There is a sound of
movement coming from the floor above He runs up
the steps to the floor above and sees a very faint
light coming through one of the closed apartment
doors Carefully takes out a gun and then with one
quick movement he breaks through the door

INT ABANDONED APARTMENT

The walls ceiling floors are entirely covered
with crudely painted psychedelic signs and sayings
The room is lighted by some candies stuck in
bottles Sitting on a blanket on the floor are
several teenaged boys and girls having a pot party
They have obviously made a clubhouse for themselves
in the abandoned house It is a MOOT POINT whether
they or KLUTE is more stunned at the sight that
faces them He puts his gun away in embarrassment
Again he has been made to feel like an awkward
peeping tom in this hidden world of the city

INT CELLAR - ABANDONED BUILDING

CAMERA wanders restlessly through the blackness and
stops at a pinpoint of light coming through a low
door CAMERA goes through opening into long narrow
furnace room with the ceiling so low that an
ordinary man could not stand up We hear the sound
of breathing CAMERA follows the sound through the
darkness revealing a sweaty man huddled in the
corner looking like some strange animal from a
painting by Bosch It is Cable

up against a corner shivering immobilized We hear

Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the
Dumper too

BREE
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin
- shes the one who started Frank
Shes strung out now you wont
find her

KLUTE
You could help me find her You
know the people
(as she turns away)
Ill pay you a hundred dollars

BREE
I can make that in a lunch break
(then)
Look Hiram youre sure it isnt
just me -- you decided you liked
it after all the other night
youll hang around for seconds

KLUTE
Dont worry

She examines him -- shrugs -- turns proceeds along
the sidewalk Klute accompanying --

EXT DISCOTHEQUE - NIGHT

In the small hours The same place seen previously
the gathering place KLUTE BREE arriving and
entering

INT DISCOTHEQUE - NIGHT

Klute and Bree head toward the rear Her arrival

BREE

Bree leads on to where --
PAST KLUTE BREE TO TRINA

TRINA sits alone at a rear table -- anything but a
whore in appearance -- a quietly beautiful
immaculately dressed woman of about thirty

BREE (CONTD)
Trina this is Klute I told you
about him

TRINA
Oh yes Mr Klute -- wont you both
join me
(as they sit)
And how do you like our fair city
Theres so much here dont you
think The museums and the books
and the foreign films -- Bree have
you seen the Godard film

BREE

TRINA
Oh youve got to He does such fun

things with imagery And Ive been
reading The Fall --
(to Klute enunciating
carefully)
-- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo --
its the same thing you know the
imagery --

BREE
(patiently)
Trina honey he just wants to find
Arlyn Page

Trina undergoes a change of demeanor Flatly --

TRINA
Why Shes a junkie

BREE
(prods gently)
She was with you after she left
Frank

TRINA

Well shes not now

(then quavering --)
I did everything for Arlyn I loved
Arlyn I took her right into my
apartment my own sweet apartment
on First But she wouldnt stay off
it -- the junk -- and I wept and I
pleaded and I held her in my arms -
and she started taking things my
things and selling them for horse

My clothes

We couldve had everything
together everything -- and then
the bitch sold

my mink

INT ANOTHER LATE NIGHT SPOT - NIGHT

We dolly with KLUTE and BREE as they walk in front of
a row of tables This night spot is totally black
except for a series of huge slide projections on
the wall in back of the tables The slides which
change every few seconds are elegant
representations of the beautiful people living the
good life as seen in such magazines as VOGUE TOWN
and COUNTRY and HARPERS BAZAAR The customers sitting
in the darkness below provide a direct contrast to
the pictures in back The silhouette figures of
BREE and KLUTE stop at a table seating three people
two call girls and a pimp CAMERA moves in

FIRST GIRL
Arlyn Page

SECOND GIRL
Youll never catch up shes
grooved out

BREE
Gil

The pimp looks distrustfully at Klute who reassures

KLUTE
Im not looking for her personally
- someone she might know about

PIMP
(shrugs to Bree)
Try Janie Dale

INT JANIE DALES PENTHOUSE

It is a very small penthouse KLUTE and BREE stand in
the small living room waiting for JANIE DALE There
are two very casually dressed prostitutes sitting
around the living room One sits at an upright
piano playing of all things STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT
Another one sits on a couch talking to a Wall
Street Broker who is spending his lunch hour KLUTE
finds himself staring down into a pile of
pornography magazines on the coffee table BREE is
amused at his discomfort

JANIE DALE the madame who has been on the phone
in the back puts the receiver down and crosses to
the girl on the couch JANIE looks and talks a bit
like Lauren Bacall

JANIE DALE

(to girl on couch)
Its old Mr Clean from Cleveland
He wants to know when he can fly in
and clean up the apartment and see
you I told him I have all the
cleaning equipment and that he can
come anytime but its up to you

GIRL on couch rises

GIRL
You know he wants us to be
dominant

JANIE DALE

Tell him that hed better have his
ass in here by one oclock on
Monday afternoon or you wont let
him clean the bathroom floor and
tell him the price has gone up

twenty bucks -- Old Dutcn
Cleansers not as cheap as it used
to be

She shrugs and turns to KLUTE and BREE

JANIE DALE (CONTD)
You wanted to know about Arlyn
honey I had to let her go dear
Arlyn stopped being reliable

(explains to Klute)

I deal with a high type client
business people you understand I
cant send them someone thats all
the time half zonked out

KLUTE
Do you know where she went

JANIE DALE
Try Momma Reese

THIS IS A CHEAPER APARTIENT THAN JANIE DALES

The girls look cheaper and the customers rather
than Wall Street lawyers and brokers look more
like out of town salesmen who stay at local motor
inns

MOMMA REESE is older than JANIE DALE heavier and
with no pretense at chic She indicates that she
has not seen ARLYN in some time

MOMMA REESE
Try Bill Azure If you can find
him

INT EIGHT AVENUE BAR - ABOUT 4 IN THE MORNING

This is a hangout where black and white pimps wait
to meet their whores after their night of street
walking This streetwalker world is far removed
from the world of the call girl or the world of
Janie Dale CAMERA pans past a group of pimps at
the bar taking bet on whose girls have made the
most money that night CAMERA then goes on to
reveal KLUTE talking to another pimp (Azure) Azure
represents a clear step down from Frank Ligourin

We catch only part of their dialogue
AZURE

-- a couple weeks then shed drift
off a couple of weeks you know
what I mean

KLUTE
Have you heard from her recently

AZURE
She liked me all right but she had
what she liked better you know
what I mean

We START FADE SOUND as Klute repeats --

KLUTE
Have you heard from her recently

-- and CUT TO --
INT LINGERIE SHOP PROPRIETRESS BREE KLUTE

PROPRIETRESS
-- Shed come in and Id let her
have something Why not shed been
a good customer a beautiful
person a beautiful beautiful

Again we fade sound a little before picture then
CUT TO --

EXT OUTSIDE ADULT MOVIE THEATER KLUTE
STREETWALKERS - DAY OR NIGHT

Outside Theatre or Bookstore - Peepshow an 8th
Avenue establishment SILENT ACTION this (or VOICES
UNDER) Klute confers with one girl who summons and
consults another They seem to know of Arlyn --
havent seen her recently -- refer him elsewhere --

EXT APARTMENT HOUSE MRS VASEK KLUTE - DAY

A shabby place in a shabby neighborhood Mrs
Vasek the landlady shifts barrels at the same
time that she barks at Klute in heavy accent

MRS VASEK
The whore yeah I threw out

KLUTE
Do you know where she went from
here

MRS VASEK
Live like animals Her and the man
Out

KLUTE
(reacts)
Was she living with a man

We see Klute persisting - DISSOLVE
EXT WIDE SHOT SLUM STREET - DAY

We still HOLD WIDE to establish the scene This is
a genuine slum We see Bree Klute move along
street We see Bree drop back a little Klute
waiting for her to catch up

EXT STREET BREE KLUTE

KLUTE
Whats the matter

BREE
(glances about)
What the hell do you thinks the
matter
(then suggests)
I could wait for you someplace

KLUTE
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom
Grunemann --

BREE
(eagerly)
-- Then you dont need me

KLUTE
But if its someone else I do

He starts on simply assuming that shell follow
(There is a degree of acquaintanceship in their
manners now - a reluctant collaboration)

BREE
You sure pull a lot of mileage out
of a hundred dollars

-- and follows on He checks numbers then crosses
street diagonally toward a half-framed house

INT NEWARK HOUSE - DAY

A downshot from second floor level toward the entry
way where KLUTE and BREE appear KLUTE strikes a
match to inspect the names of tenants He and Bree
climb through stench and litter to the second floor
-- a door From somewhere near at hand come the
sounds of someone RETCHING A square of wood has
been sawed out of the door itself removing handle
and lock -- light sifts through Klute hesitates
decides against knocking pushes in
INT ARLYNS APARTMENT - DAY

The retching sounds are coming from the connecting
room No one visible here A very few barren pieces
of furniture We hear ARLYNS VOICE ask from the
next room --

ARLYN (OS)
Cappy

ARLYN enters rather eagerly She sees Klute first
then Bree -- recognizes her -- retires flat against
a wall holding one palm outwards to shield her
face She is unbelievably gaunt Inside one elbow
looking rather like a birthmark we see a lacework
of purple where her veins have pulped together

BREE
Arlyn Honey
(then)
Look its all right

From the connecting room a MANS VOICE (Bergers)
calling out hoarsely

BERGER (0S)
Is it Cappy Cappy --

BREE
Arlyn its all right

BERGER hastens stumbles into the doorframe
carrying a CAR-RADIO with wires dangling speaks
before he sees them

BERGER
Cappy I got a radio

He stops for an instant face-to-face with Klute
Then turns plunges out of view again Arlyn breaks
after

ARLYN
No --

We hear the MUMBLE and WHISPER of their voices from
the connecting room (as she reassures him) Bree
looks inquiringly at Klute (is that Grunemann) he
shakes his head Pause then ARLYN reenters
wrapping her fingers together timidly -- wanting
them out -- her only purpose

ARLYN (CONTD)
Bree -- honey - please were
waiting for someone

BREE

Arlyn he just wanted to ask some
questions -- something you could

help us about

ARLYN

Cant you see Im strung out

(cries out)

Please were waiting for it --

hes got to have it

KLUTE

Well go Just something you could

tell us first

Arlyn seems to accept the bargain He indicates to

Bree to proceed stands away a little

Arlyn covers

her elbow with one hand Bree manages as best she

can
BREE
Honey a couple of years ago with
Jane and Frankie -- Jane sent me a

Dumper --

ARLYN

Please if he sees you he wont

come

BREE

Arlyn just tell me did Jane have
a dumper one of her regular Johns

ARLYN
What about him Yes

BREE
Did he come around often

Klute hands Grunemanns picture to Bree Bree shows
it to Arlyn Arlyn inspects it then uncertainly

weakly --

ARLYN
No He was an older man hon
dumper was older

KLUTE

The

Do you remember his name What can

We hear FOOTSTEPS - UNDER DIMLY - mounting the
stairs Bree notices them first Klute persisting

with Arlyn --
BERGER (0S)
(shouts desperately)
Arlyn get them out

ARLYN
Please I am begging you

KLUTE
Its important

ARLYN
Thats not the Dumper thats all
He was an older man

KLUTE
Can you give me any more
description than that

Arlyn catches the footsteps dodges past him toward
the door intending to reassure --

ARLYN
Cappy --

-- as the pusher CAPPY steps in All of this is
very quick simultaneous a confusion of voices
CAPPY takes one look at Klute --

ARLYN (CONTD)
Its all right theyre all right --

-- turns and runs

BERGER (0S)
Cappy -- Cappy

Cappys FOOTSTEPS race away down the stairs BERGER
plunges out from the connecting room still
carrying the car radio shouting pursuing --

BERGER (CONTD)
Cappy its all right I got a radio
-- dont run dont --

We hear him STUMBLE AND FALL on the stairs outside
the sound of body reeling down Arlyn shrieks and
races after Klute and Bree follow

INT HOUSE LOWER HALL - DAY

We see BERGER lying at the foot of the stairs As
Arlyn clatters down toward him Berger sways up
onto his knees His nose is bloodied he cries
Arlyn casts herself on her knees beside him pulls
his face against her croons to him soothes and
tends him

ARLYN
Oh baby -- no its all right -- oh
my baby baby baby --

Klute and Bree are only a half-step behind Klute
offers to assist Arlyn puts him away ferociously

ARLYN (CONTD)
Get out
(to Berger again)

Dont cry my baby Ill find him
Ill get it Baby baby dont cry
(to Klute savagely

incoherently)
Leave us alone Get out and get out
and leave us alone

(to Berger)
My honey my baby my baby --

We DISSOLVE TO --

INT SUBWAY TRAIN REFLECTION IN WINDOW OF BREE AND
KLUTE SITTING SIDE BY SIDE

CAMERA moves in closer so we only see reflection of
BREE looking at herself and at the world seeming to
speed by at an inhuman pace as the lights of the
tunnel zoom past her face What she sees is the
figure of a woman with life screaming past her out
of control

INT SUBWAY

SUBWAY slows to a stop and a door opens BREE sits
with KLUTE staring at the open door and then
without warning - gets up and runs off the train
The door closes leaving KLUTE locked in the train

SUBWAY EXIT

SHOT of BREEs feet rushing up the stairs in
darkness and then quick cut to her face as she hits
the sunlight She pauses for a moment - relieved to
be out of the darkness

EXT ROOFTOP OF BREES BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

CAMERA pans from night view of New York City to
KLUTE sitting on the rooftop alone as if trying to
comprehend all he has seen the mystery of TOM
GRUNEMANNs disappearance in this world and the
mysteries of the behavior of BREE

SKYLIGHT INTO BREES APARTMENT - NIGHT
Alongside of him the skylight of BREEs apartment

lights up He looks through the skylight and sees

BREE enter her apartment He can hear BREE talking
to somebody and then he sees that she is talking

to FRANK LIGOURIN

KLUTE watches through the skylight and hears bits
and pieces of the scene between BREE and FRANK He
sees the same kind of symbiosis the same kind of
parody of loving that he saw between ARLYN and
BERGER As the scene becomes more intimate he
leaves

INT CABLES (CITY) OFFICE ON KLUTE - DAY

The pristine antiseptic elegance off CABLES
office is in its own way as unreal and dehumanized
as the sexual underworld KLUTE has been exploring
with BREE and KLUTE looks as out of place in the
one as he does in the other TRASK sits beside
KLUTE facing CABLE who is impeccably dressed He is
the total image of the executive in control

CABLE
She wouldnt be reliable anyhow --
a narcotics addict

KLUTE
I believed her Pete

TRASK
Hes right you know Waiting for
the pusher shed tell you
anything

KLUTE
I believed her the Dumper was not
Tom Grunemann

CABLE
All right suppose it wasnt Tom
Grunemann where does that get you

KLUTE
(smiles ruefully)
Its where it doesnt get me Ive
got nothing left that connects to
anything

CABLE
Then close the case

KLUTE
I better keep looking
CABLE
Where how

KLUTE
(the best he can offer)
I could try Arlyn Page again She
saw much more of the Dumper than
Bree Daniel

CABLE

You just finished telling me she
had nothing to offer Not Tom you
said the Dumper was clearly not
Tom

KLUTE
Its got to make sense some way

CABLES SECRETARY appears for a moment tapping her
watch significantly

SECRETARY
Mr Cable -- they are meeting in
Mr Camaras office

CABLE
Yes Evvie thanks Gentlemen Im
sorry

They rise dismissed He sorts a paper or two
continues to Klute

CABLE (CONTD)
Im flying back out to Pennsylvania
Friday Ill fill them in on
things

KLUTE
How is it back there

CABLE

I think youre homesick

(reflects)
Ill be out at my camp over the
weekend Nice right now that touch
of fall in the air that skim of
frost in the early mornings very
peaceful

(briskly again)
John Ill be back here again
Thursday Ill be in touch
Lieutenant thank you

KLUTE and TRASK depart

CABLE closes the door and returns to his desk He
pulls out a tape recorder from a drawer in his
desk rewinds it and turns it on We hear a
playback of the previous scene with KLUTE and
TRASK He stands at the window listening with some
satisfaction as if listening to what KLUTE
revealed keeps him in control of the situation

EXT WINDOW - CABLES OFFICE - DAY

The CAMERA pulls back from a CU of CABLE standing
at the window to a wide angle looking at CABLE
through the window The window is 30 or 40 stories
high The wide angle lens almost makes the building
look like it is standing on point and CABLE a man
suspended in space

EXT WIDE SHOT DOCKS - DAY

A TUGBOAT has pulled in The SOUND of its heavy
ENGINES IDLING runs underneath this entire
sequence A POLICE VEHICLE or two has parked at the
head of the dock We see several figures on the
rear deck of the tug but its not clear at this
distance what theyre doing The POLICE CAR WITH
KLUTE arrives He dismounts and proceeds from dock
to tug-deck

EXT TUGBOAT DECK GROUP - DAY

TRASK glances toward Klute as he arrives but
doesnt greet him His attention like the others
is directed downward and

off-scene (to the surface of the water actually
just outboard of the tug) We see beside Trask TWO
Uniformed Cops (SUGARMAN and SPENCE) and DECKHANDS
And we hear along with the throbbing of the
engines a stirring about of the water anda
peculiar third noise -- rather commingled with the
engines -- which we cant at first identify

Klute joins the group watches

SPENCE brings into view and shakes out a giant
neoprene body bag INSTRUCTIONS among the group AD
LIB UNDER --

TRASK
(toward Klute)
They were bringing a freighter down
through Kill Van Kull propellers
washed it up on top

SUGARMAN brings into view a METAL BASKET attached
with short ropes He complains --
SUGARMAN
Why didnt you bring it up on deck

DECKHAND
Would you bring it up on deck

They slip the basket downward out of frame (into
the water)

DECKHAND (CONTD)

(to other)
Mickey get something Get the eels
off
SPENCE
(calmly)

Theyll drop off theirselves when
she comes out

We CUT TO -
BERGER - DAY

We see Berger sitting huddled against the tugboat

cabin -- we havent seen him before -- with his
hands bunched in front of his mouth We identify
the noise which may have puzzled us before -- his
SOBBING

DOWNSHOT SURFAICE OF WATER BASKET BODY

We catch a fleeting glimpse of the body being
lifted just before it breaks the surface of the
water

FAVORING KLUTE

Klute looks on as EFFECTS trace the processing of
the body SPENCE kneels down out of frame to slide
the bag around it TRASK kneels down to make a
brief examination -- straightens again To Klute --

TRASK
Itll go to the Examiner But I
dont see nothin that means nothin

We MOVE WITH KLUTE as he turns and moves away a few
feet along deck Here he stands Then SUGARMAN
moves into view holding a clipboard Routinely --

SUGARMAN
You help us with ID We cant get
nothin from him

He indicates the direction of Berger Klute
examines the clipboard data
KLUTE
Arlyn Page was probably an alias
She went by the names Terry Arlyn
and June Price She may have been
from Pittsburgh someone told me I
can give you a list of people who
knew her if that would help to --

SUGARMAN
No point thanks

KLUTE
Is he claiming the body

SUGARMAN
Uh uh thatd mean funeral
expenses

He spits moves back in the direction of the group
Klute continues to stand BERGER moves in his
direction Brokenly --

BERGER
Man could you help me

Klute doesnt understand his purport reacts
instantly sympathetically --

KLUTE
Yeah what

BERGER
You know help me out Thats my
baby there dead I got to get up

Klute stares at him -- a quiet horror -- as Berger
insists --

BERGER (CONTD)
Man you dont know what that does
to me my baby dead --

KLUTE
-- Youve got to get up

BERGER
Yeah

Klute shoves a bill in his hand turns away very
sharply off the tugboat

EXT DOCK KLUTE - DAY

Klute walks a longer distance this time sits down
on one of the pilings of the dock Watching him we
see what might be a profound awe and grief at all
these things -- but is in fact a good deal more

EFFECTS OS as Police Vehicles are loaded driven
away and as tug toots runs up engines puts out
again

TRASK moves into scene sits on another piling
looks at him speculatively Silence Then --

TRASK
Thats how the other one died you
know In the water

KLUTE
(nods)
I looked it up

Then -- (we are assuming a complete understanding
here between Klute and Trask non-verbal What
Trask is asking in effect is is this meaningful
Do we both suspect the same man)

TRASK
Well

KLUTE
Yeah

INT BREES APARTMENT - DAY

It is late afternoon but BREE is in her pajamas
curled up in her bed There are some magazines
scattered around the bed and the television set is
on an old movie There are cracker crumbs in the
bed and a cup of coffee and an open jar of peanut
butter with the knife sticking out of the jar on
the floor by the bed It would seem that BREE has
spent most of the day in bed She looks like an
unkempt child The phone is ringing but she does
not answer it The phone no sooner stops than the
door bell rings Reluctantly she gets out of bed
and goes to the door She looks through the spy
hole and sees Klutes face She undoes two locks
and an obviously new chain and bolt and opens the
door

BREE
Well hello -- come on in

He barely enters the room His manner is cool and
remote

KLUTE
I thought you ought to know Arlyn
Page is dead
BREE
How

KLUTE
The same as Jane McKenna

BREE
(she betrays no reaction)
Thanks for the jolly news I
thought maybe youd left town by
now You kind of just disappeared
But you boys from Tuscarora have a
habit of disappearing dont you

Klute looks around the disorderly room The plants
in the windowsill have never been in worse shape
They look as if she deliberately let them die of
thirst

KLUTE
The next few weeks I would like to
know where you are all the time

BREE
(harshly)
Why

KLUTE
Just let me know when you are going
out and where --

BREE
What if i go out on tricks - you
wanna come along You could sit and
read the National Geographic

KLUTE
How can you do it to yourself

BREE
(coolly)
I dont get you

KLUTE
Ligourin How could you do it

BREE
I told you before you wouldnt
understand

KLUTE

Youre right I dont understand
Explain it to me

(pause)
You were scared Arlyn Page that
scared you Well it should thats
death

So what did you do you ran
straight for it death Ligourin

BREE
No

KLUTE
No no youre right Im sorry He
uses women he lets them kill

it

BREE
Arlyn was a junkie Im not on

KLUTE
No you can find some other way

(beat)

Explain it to me Bree show me any
sense to --

BREE

(screams incoherently)
You get the Christ out You dumb
stupid bastard you dont know
anything you square you get out
I dont have to show you anything

Klute goes
INT KLUTES APARTMENT - DAY

The empty apartment He enters switches a light on
(dusk) tosses aside jacket bookcase etc then
sits down on the edge of his bed with one foot
propped up on it

FOOTSTEPS and A RAP at the door He looks up but
doesnt move doesnt answer BREE opens it
enters There are tear-tracks down her face but
shes no longer crying She tries to smile tries
to explain her wants Then with the unhurried
graven composure of absolute desperation she sits
on the edge of the bed

BREE
If I asked you something would you
not laugh -- asked you to look at

something

She pushes up her sleeve points at tiny spot on
her arm - a freckle He peers at it then at her
puzzledly

BREE (CONTD)
(apologetic)
I thought it was maybe changing
shape or something

Klute looks at it again Judiciously --

He shows her a spot or two on his own forearm She
compares is reassured Embarrassedly she tries to
smile It is unsuccessful She gets up and moves
about Her manner in general is totally unguarded
honest undramatic searching

BREE (CONTD)
Look -- I hate everybody and Im
sorry for everybody and Im scared
all the time

He only grunts A sound like OK or ‘all right --
an invitation to leave But she wont be driven
away More urgently helplessly

BREE (CONTD)
Look I dont know either Its
like the only thing I know how to
do -- I feel safe

Shes left the door a little ajar He widens it for
her

KLUTE
Its been a full day

She pushes it out of his hand pushes it shut A
little more angrily

BREE
Please

KLUTE
We did this before

BREE
No
(then)
Well all right But you want to and
I want you to and we both know it
and all right

KLUTE
(evenly slowly)
I dont like getting splashed
She accepts it decently Tries to smile again
nods

BREE

She gestures tries to find something more to say
moves by degrees toward the door -- and would
succeed in leaving But then

KLUTE
--- Bree ---

Standing still she starts again to cry -- and
bravely to keep the crying to herself The child
bereft He contends with himself then crosses to
her puts his arms around her soothes her hair A
completely asexual gesture at this point a giving
of comfort She clings trembles burrows Then --
a SERIES OF DISSOLVES The street outside at
different times of night interposed with Bree and
Klute at different times of love As Follows

EXT THE STREET - DAY

The street as we saw it just previously still
daylight still somewhat populated but drawing
toward dusk

DISSOLVE
INT KLUTES APARTMENT BPEE KLUTE - NIGHT

Darkness now or close to dark the room heavily
shadowed Bree and Klute sit together on the bed
He still strokes her hair He has pulled a blanket
around her shoulders The transaction is still not
overtly sexual but the tenderness is more overt
He rubs his cheek against her forehead She herself
is quieter comforted She begins to stir against
him

DISSOLVE
EXT THE STREET - NIGHT

The street at night Eleven oclock lets say
Some lit windows a single car moving past

DISSOLVE
EXT THE STREET - NIGHT

All the windows dark this time The deepest night
just before the sky begins to lighten
DISSOLVE
INT KLUTES APARTMENT BREE KLUTE - NIGHT

Klute is alseep -- more or less -- on his stomach
Bree beside him lies awake She trails her fingers
about his back A rather tentative exploratory
business Her expression is more wondering than
anything else -- what does she have here and can
she get used to it

DISSOLVE
EXT THE STREET - DAY (DAWN)

The streets first stirrings From not far off the
sounds of trash cans being collected

DISSOLVE
INT KLUTES APARTMENT BREE KLUTE - DAY (DAWN)

Klute half sits up in bed Bree is fast asleep with
her head pillowed on his midsection Some humor in
this shot he wants to move but doesnt want to
wake her At a point he risks it reaches out for
something beside the bed Her eyes open
immediately He puts his hand on her face trying
gently to press her back

KLUTE
Go back to sleep

But she takes his hand -- and retains it -- rolls
onto her back Still relaxed but a little more
separate thoughtful -- a mixture of the Bree weve

seen before and the Bree weve glimpsed the
possible Bree She observes

BREE

Im still scared

(beat)
I mean different but still

(frowns)
Look I made it very clear from the
start youre a yokel you dont
excite me you dont even interest
me and so I only have one question
which is what the hell are you
doing in my bed

KLUTE
My bed

She grins then starts to reach for him still
receptive -- then feels another (and genuine) pang
turns her head away sharply

BREE
Oh

He looks at her with concern but only caresses
her She manages to explain --

BREE (CONTD)
I am scared The things I do The
things I could do to you

KLUTE
Mm
BREE
No not just mm You dont know
what I --
He settles himself beside her makes overtures She
responds but
BREE (CONTD)
Oh boy say you think youre
pretty good
KLUTE
Yup
She pretends to bite -- they tussle -- she feels a

suddenly growing excitement seizes him Fiercely

welcomingly full out

BREE
Oh --

And we cut directly to
INT SPANGLERS OFFICE BREE SPANGLER - DAY

Bree standing angry antagonistic demanding

Ina

way -- a Bree-like way -- shes seized psychiatry

by the throat

BREE
The son of a bitch seduced me

She waits Spangler says nothing

BREE (CONTD)
I know its ridiculous But its
tearing me up and I dont know why
And look all right I came here
didnt I And if I have to Ill
keep coming here the works and
talk about my mummy and my daddy
and Ill even pay for it but will
you kindly for Gods sakes say
something

SPANGLER
(smiles)
Id just be guessing

BREE
Guess

SPANGLER
Maybe this wasnt just a trick
Maybe youre in danger of real
love real involve --

BREE
(primly distintly)
I do not love him

SPANGLER
(undeterred suggests)
Youve spent your life avoiding
this Youll try hard to deny it
youre quite likely to destroy it

WE CUT TO
EXT THE PLAZA OF LINCOLN CENTER

Sunlight is beaming on the graceful fountains and
elegant architecture

Groups of cheerful tourists are admiring the
civilized monuments to mans search for culture
CAMERA pans to ugly street across the way revealing
Klute approaching and entering a dingy warehouse
topped by an absurdly placed copy of the Statue of
Liberty This is the municipal storehouse

INT MUNICIPAL STOREHOUSE - DAY

The abrupt cut from the bright sunlight leaves us
in almost total darkness as we follow KLUTE We are
in a huge storeroom As we grow accustomed to the
darkness we see bits and pieces of incongruous
objects scattered along Klutes path - old pieces
of furniture lamps piggy banks etc - the
remnants of the lives of the plundered the
destroyed and the dispossessed Some is stolen
property some evidence for homicide cases and
some the unclaimed possessions of the unclaimed
dead

A CUSTODIAN -- an ancient retainer sort a civil
servant leads KLUTE into an old elevator cage
INT ELEVATOR

Klute and Custodian as elevator ascends looking up
the elevator shaft through the open cage we see a
series of doors hanging over space seeming to lead
nowhere The whole sequence has the feeling of a
dream of being lost in a black limbo

Klute and Custodian leave elevator on higher floor
and walk down the long very low corridor past rows
of locked vault doors The Custodian stops at one

and opens it We are in a small dungeon-like room

filled with banks of files from floor to ceiling

The Custodian counts to himself --

CUSTODIAN
Four -- five -- what numberd I
say

KLUTE

Four ninety-seven Jane McKenna

Custodian finds it unlocks for Klutes inspection
Reaches for paper Klutes holding

CUSTODIAN
-- And I keep the authorization
please

KLUTE

I thought thered be more

Klute pokes through a small collection of personal
effects -- perhaps an ankle bracelet rabbits foot
faded snapshot of a child some letters pitiful
remnants of Jane McKennas life Klute closes the
drawer and the front of the drawer is marked
McKENNA JANE

Over the visual material of Klutes trip through
the warehouse we hear WILD TRACK VOICE OVER bits
and pieces of BREE talking with the psychiatrist

BREE (VO)
All right Loneliness

(space)
Well -- separated From other
people Forgotten

(space)

Well as if I can be here I can go
through the motions right But the
truth is I dont belong

SPANGLER (VO)
(prompts mildly)
Dont belong
BREE (VO)
(snappishly)
Do you always have to repeat

SPANGLER (VO)
Sorry
(then)

BREE (VO)
Well its more than loneliness
Hate People hating me -- and
watching me and following and
waiting to hurt me -- you know Im
all screwed up

SPANGLER (VO)
You think people hate you

BREE (V0O)
The truth is I hate them they must
hate me All right the money

(pause)
All right not the money A kind of
put-on
It gets things back together
(pause)

Well lets say Id go to one of
these cattle-calls a tryout I
mean before -- before I got this
job -- and theyd always say thank
you very much and id feel you
know brought down They didnt
want me

SPANGLER (VO)
Didnt want you

BREE (V0O)

(snaps)
I said that
(resumes)
Well so you have a choice You can
either feel lonely -- you know the
hate -- or --
(then more rapidly
plunging)

So you take a call and go toa
hotel room and theres some John
youve never seen before but he
wants you He must hes paying for
it

(beat)
And usually theyre nervous and
thats all right too because
youre not you know this thing
And then for a while boy they
really pay attention youre all

there is

(beat)
And its not real and you dont
have to even like them -- you can
even hate them its all right it
safe -- you know

INT PROJECTION ROOM - MISSING PERSONS BUREAU

On the left a portion of the original obscene
letter On the right a series of comparison
documents -- beginning with a portion of a personal
letter We hear TRASKS KLUTES VOICES OVER and
occasionally cut to them as --

TRASKS VOICE
(skipping summarizing)
All right theres Tom Grunemann
youre right different margins
different spacing absolutely
sloppy right

KLUTES VOICE
Mm

TRASKS VOICE
All right try this next guy

The right-hand document is switched
KLUTE TRASK
Klute reacts

TRASK
Think this is our guy

KLUTE
I dont know It looks familiar to
me

TRASK

Thought it might Its off an
arrest report you typed two years
ago Man you wanted samples of
everybody

Then -- with subdued satisfaction switching the
projector again

TRASK (CONTD)
Now the next cat Mm

SCREEN DOCUMENTS
TRASKS VOICE
Same margins top and sides He does
best with his middle fingers you
get fainter registration from
outside keys like Q A L P and
like that Next thing look around
apostrophes how he hits the space
bar before --

KLUTE and TRASK - STARING AT PROJECTIONS

KLUTE
But what reason could he have What
possible reason

TRASK
Unless he was involved with
Grunemanns disappearance

KLUTE
I knew Tom never wrote that letter

TRASK
What else do you know

KLUTE
I never could believe that Tom was
a split personality I never
believed he was a Dumper and I
dont believe he disappeared of his
own volition and I dont believe
es alive

TRASK

We have some very tentative
circumstantial evidence of freeky
behavior but theres no evidence
of murder - theres not even a
body

KLUTE
I dont believe Toms alive

As Klute talks he paces back and forth in the
darkness He crosses in front of the lighted
screen the letters projected on the screen ripple
over his face

KLUTE (CONTD)
But why Why

INT MISSING PERSONS BUREAU

Klute and Trask are seen entering from the
Projection Room In the background we see an old
black woman sitting in front of the picture file of
unidentified dead carefully studying each picture

In the foreground Klute sits down at a phone and
dials

KLUTE
Yes Mr Cables office please

CAMERA goes in close on Klute

CABLES VOICE
(through telephone)

KLUTE

CABLES VOICE
Its a beautiful day in Tuscarora -
I dont envy you that humidity in
the city

KLUTE
Its not so bad

There is a silence Both Klute and Cable seem to be
waiting for one or the other to make the next move

KLUTE (CONTD)
Would you like to know whats in
it The report

CABLES VOICE
(obligingly)
Whats in it

KLUTE
I think Tom Grunemanns dead Ive

lot of people Ive found no proof

was ever around

CABLE VOICE
How do you go from that to the idea
Toms dead Suicide youre
suggesting He killed himself

KLUTE
(plodding unemphatic)
He couldve been murdered

CABLES VOICE

explored that possibility

KLUTE
No They never did really But

The next step Unless something --

CABLES VOICE

KLUTE

CABLES VOICE

CABLES VOICE

KLUTE
Goodbye Pete

Klute hangs up

KLUTE (CONTD)
He was always at their house on

holidays Tom and Holly always had

him over on holidays Tom felt
sorry for him - his whole life was
work Tom felt sorry for him

The old black lady motions to Trask who crosses to

her

She points to a picture in the file

She has

obviously found her missing person among the
photographs of the unidentified dead She

stand but then sits again

starts to
obviously shaken

Klute crosses to her and gently helps her out of

the chair

loss he feels for his friend

He sees in her face the same sense of
EXT OUTDOOR MARKETS - EIGHT AVENUE - NIGHT
KLUTE and BREE

Bree examining and feeling fruit in some imitation
of a very shrewd and experienced housewife shopper
She is obviously enjoying her sense of domesticity
and Klute is amused by her enjoyment

OUTDOOR NURSERY - EIGHT AVENUE - NEXT TO MARKET

The nursery is an absurdly cheerful spot of
greenery in the midst of the dirty chaos of the
avenue

Klute and Bree wander through the plants

BREE
I saw Mr Faber
(beat)
You remember Mr Faber dont you

KLUTE
(controlledly)
Yeah

BREE
Is that all you have to say

KLUTE
What am I supposed to say

BREE

Well I told him I wouldnt - uh -
go there any more

(pause)
I know its tough to understand
but it wasnt easy You see he was
nice to me I mean it wasnt just
him I got something out of it too
I guess Anyway I told him I
wouldnt go there anymore

She is like a child awaiting praise from her
teacher Klute says nothing They continue walking
among the plants and he picks up a few that she had
admired

KLUTE
Well heres your gold star

Considering his contempt for all the dead plant
life he has seen in her apartment in the past she
is pleased by this act of belief in her
BREE
Spangler says we have a

relationship
KLUTE

What
BREE

You and I -- a relationship
KLUTE

I was wondering what that was

BREE
(beat)
Hell theres nothing so mysterious
about the square life

EXT BROWNSTONE ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

Bree Klute approach unhurriedly along the
sidewalk She is holding his arm HUMS to herself
enjoys the evening

INT STAIRWALL - NIGHT
We follow them up
INT ANGLE INTO BREE APARTMENT - NIGHT

The apartment is a shambles -- furniture
overturned decorations ripped from the wall
bedding scattered and ripped

INT BREE APARTMENT - NIGHT

Klute jettisons the grocery bags thrusts himself
inside looks quickly about finds no one Bree
follows more slowly whispering

BREE
Oh Jesus Oh Jesus

KLUTE
Dont touch anything

He moves quickly to the rear of the apartment
looks at the rear window which has been broken
inward in a litter of glass -- then returns to the
table at the front of the apartment his folders
Bree cracks wise unsteadily

BREE
You suppose hes a married fella

ANGLE TO TABLE FOLDERS
The contents of the folders have been spilled
across the table and -- we ZOOM IN -- the
photographs of Tom Grunemann sorted out and ripped
apart Even the COMPANY PICNIC photograph has been
painstakingly torn specifically to destroy the
image of Grunemann in the front row

KLUTE
He stands looking down taking no notice as --

BREE
He got in my clothing

Then a moment later she cries out again more
sharply

BREE (CONTD)
Oh Oh

He turns quickly She is holding out at arms
length a pair of her underpants With a disgust so
extreme she can only laugh

BREE (CONTD)
Oh look what he did in them

KLUTE
Drop it

She doesnt respond He seizes her arm shakes the
garment back onto the floor She starts to gag
slaps her hand over her mouth starts for the
bathroom Klute yanks her back

KLUTE (CONTD)
Stay out of there

She twists free of his hands backs away The same
elementary terror weve seen before

KLUTE (CONTD)
Listen to me Its all right Ive
been expecting something

BREE
(full out vengefully)
My God I thought it was over And
here I am daddy right back at the
start

KLUTE
Bree -—

BREE
Right back at the start right

KLUTE
Go down in my room

BREE
You said it was over right You

Shes broken for the door its questionable that
shes even heard him He hasnt time to pursue --
shouts again --

KLUTE
Go down in my room and wait

Then he turns back into the apartment
INT BREES APARTMENT - DAY

A DOWNSHOT TO UNDERPANTS (as if from Klutes POV
connecting directly to the previous shot) -- then a
FLASHBULB goes off and a hand and pair of tongs
enter frame and flip the garment into a collecting
box and we widen to reveal that its now daylight
and the scene has been invaded by POLICE
TECHNICIANS One is a photographer another a
fingerprint man is spraying surfaces with a can of
fixative In the foreground Klute and Trask are
talking with Ross the FBI man Ross is looking
through a dossier on Cable that Klute has compiled
Over the following conversation we show CLOSEUPS of
material in the dossier It contains photographs of
Cable and his life from childhood to the present -
including pictures of him with his mother and
father - she a very dominant looking lady and he a
very passive looking man

also graduation pictures and pictures with his
former wife taken when he was still a very young
man They are the personal images of a life time

ROSS
(to Klute)
But if Cable killed Grunemann why
would he get you hired to look for
Grunemann

KLUTE
Because he knew I couldnt leave
the case alone And this way at
least hed keep track of it And
me

ROSS

Grunemann -- he found out Cable was
a dumper Cable couldnt take that
We think we know why he killed

McKenna -- she wanted to blackmail
him for it All fine But we got no
body no direct witnesses we cant

go any-damn-where

KLUTE
Thats the reason i told him we had
no evidence Tom was still alive We
wanted to shake him into another
phone call or another letter It
didnt work out just that way

The Technicians meanwhile have packed to depart
The first Technician scoops the torn up photographs
into another collecting box Trask retrieves the
company outing photograph

TRASK
Gov want to leave me that one How
come he got to play with this one
anyway

KLUTE
I left them here I was doing some
work here

Trask eyes Klute for a moment as if a querying his
relationship with Bree Klute is clearly
unresponsive Trask resumes

TRASK
Its damn lucky you didnt have the
dossier on Cable here

KLUTE
Nobodys seen that

TRASK
If we get anything from the lab
well have it by noon And just
think -- all he really had to do
was write us a letter

ROSS
Sounds to me you better shake him
again Put him in a spot he has to

do something more -- but this time
give him a time and a place to do
it

KLUTE

He called this morning from
Tuscarora Asked me to meet him at
300 at the downtown heliport Hes
on his way to Chicago

TRASK
He sure chalks up a lot of flight
time
Klute starts gathering his papers we CUT TO --
INT STAIRWELL BREE - DAY

Bree coming up the stairs meets the Technicians
coming down -- stands aside to let them pass --
starts up again and comes face to face with Klute
On her part we see a wish to be reconciled -- a
shyness mixed with defiance -- but Klutes manner
is arduous She smiles nervously asks --

BREE
Ah Schmendrick -- whats the scam

KLUTE
Those were police laboratory
people theyve been over the
apartment

BREE
(mock delight)

Trask wants to talk with you
She starts on then turns back toward him -- rather
pleadingly --

BREE
Hey -- look officer -- I can
explain everything It was just --

KLUTE
Trask wants to talk with you

She continues on up Klute continues down
INT BREES APARTMENT - DAY

Entering without greeting Trask (his manner is not
uncivil but simply neutral unreacting Cop-like)

she quickly gathers up a few properties a change

of shoes

TRASK
Miss Daniel be sensible you find
another place till we get things
cleaned up

BREE
(brightly)
Oh well that shouldnt take you
more than another oh two and a

BREE
What was better I made better

He coerces her to the table and unrolls the Company
outing picture (We see the rip extending up
through the image of Tom Grunemann in the front
row)

BREE
Oh no
TRASK
Like for you to look for the man

BREE
Grunemann Ive looked at him a --

Trask has clamped his thumb over the torn image of
Grunemann indicates with the other hand --

TRASK

Dumper
We see her comply -- her eyes moving over the rows

of faces Then we see her stiffen hear her gasp --

BREE

INT DOWNTOWN HELIPORT - DAY

Cable welcomes Klute His outer manner is warm
voluble congratulatory --

CABLE
Sorry we had to meet here But Im
pressed for time

KLUTE
Well theres a couple --

CABLE
I read your report I had to go
along with it -- the idea of this

being a wild goose chase Tom being
nowhere around --

KLUTE

KLUTE

CABLE
(slowly)
Some mistake perhaps that --

KLUTE
No No mistake Pete It doesnt

CABLE
You must be discouraged

KLUTE
(prosaically)
Not too bad This brings back that
Dumper in the picture

CABLE

KLUTE
Dumper the man Bree Daniel
mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and
Jane McKenna knew

CABLE
You said he was no possible
connection with Tom The Page girl

CABLE
You were hired to look for Tom not

McKennas black book

book when she died it was stolen

CABLE
You were hired to look for Tom

KLUTE
Im meeting a man tomorrow night
He wants to meet me on East-River
Drive -- he wants five hundred
dollars for the book Can you get
that for me Pete

Sometime -- right along about now -- it privately
comes to Cable that Klute may know everything and
that he Cable may be being trapped

CABLE
I cant follow you

KLUTE
Will the Company put up five
hundred dollars to get Jane
McKennas list of clients

CABLE
No Its ridiculous This has
nothing to do with Tom Grunemann
KLUTE
(shrugs stolidly)
It probably has the Dumpers name
It might give us some kind of new
lead
(beat)
I want a look at it anyhow

CABLE

Klute the Companys interest is
Tom Grunemann Solely and
exclusively You say you cant find
Tom all right Ill see that

KLUTE
All right but Im going to see

HELICOPTER FLIGHT is announced over loud speaker

Klute smiles awkwardly raises his hand in a
goodbye gesture

KLUTE
Well --

CABLE
Tomorrow See you tomorrow night

INT HELICOPTER

Cable sits down next to window The helicopter
begins to rise CAMERA goes into a medium close
shot of Cable against the helicopter window The
helicopter ascends in front of a very tall office
building made up of endless glass squares A
telephoto lens brings the glass squares of the
building directly against Cables head and
shoulders giving us the feeling that Cable is
almost levitating by himself As one floor after
another disappears behind him we see an almost
manic exhultation in Cables face as if he is on
top of things once more

EXT STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - DAY

We bring Klute along street and into the
Brownstone

INT STAIRWELL - DAY

Klute climbs the stairs to Brees apartment --
knocks He waits No answer He calls once --

KLUTE
Bree

No answer He starts downstairs again -- then turns
back unlocks the door himself enters

INT BREES APARTMENT - DAY

The room is still disordered Bree and Frank
Ligourin look at him silently Bree has been
assembling armfuls of dresses to carry away with
her Frank sits nearby in a chair Klute smiles a
little -- almost apologetically

KLUTE
Im always getting surprises

Bree doesnt answer She sets the armload of
dresses over the back of a chair moves aside to
get others Frank smiles cautiously ruefully Then

KLUTE (CONTD)
I dont want you to do this

He still doesnt extract an answer She returns
with other dresses

KLUTE (CONTD)
Please I said I dont want you to
do this

BREE
(tight small)
Trask said I should move Lets not
make a thing of it

He continues to look at her she continues to
gather possessions Then trying to smile to deal
with it casually --

BREE (CONTD)
Look too much is going on here
Im moving in with another girl
thats all Just for a while

FRANK

(helpfully)
Thats right This other girls got
a very big apartment big plenty
of room

(then)
Look its not necessarily how it
looks right Its --

He thinks better of continuing Klute looks from
him back to Bree He speaks gravely spacing his

words -- unable to speak any faster
KLUTE
No Please Not with this son of a
bitch
Frank rises both nervous and offended -- but

dealing with Klute as between civilized men
Smiling

FRANK
Klute lets handle it like
grownups I mean were all grown up
now right
(ventures forward)
-- we all respect each other you
know what I mean -- I respect you
Bree respects you -- you could say
it just didnt work out between you
and she But you got to respect her
too -- you know her best
interests best for her --

Klute hits him pursues recovers and starts to
beat him BLOOD thickly descends the side of
Franks face as he struggles away Bree is
screaming Bree grabs at him from behind He
thrusts her off But it allows Frank to break away
through the still-open door Klute pursues

INT LANDING AT DOOR - DAY

Frank clatters down a stairs as Klute arrives in
the doorframe and as Bree behind Klute screams --

BREE
No

Klute is restrained -- restrains himself Frank has
faced around on the stairs still bleeding
extravagantly from his torn scalp Earnestly --

FRANK
Hey Im gonna get you dropped

Klute starts out after him -- Frank vaults away
down the stairs -- we hear him stumbling and
running -- Klute faces sharply around into the
apartment

INT BREES APARTMENT - DAY

PAST KLUTE TO BREE She is running away from him
again to a corner of the apartment fumbling at a
sewing basket He starts in after her

KLUTE
(indistinctly)
Please --

TWO SHOT

She swings about as he overtakes her holding a
pair of scissors -- simply and transcendently
terrified She strikes at him slashing his
forearm He and she stand in absolute silence He
looks down at the stain of blood spreading through
the fabric of his jacket sleeve Then he turns out
of the room and down the stairs
EXT BREES BROWNSTONE - DAY

Klute comes out of door -- goes down steps to his
own apartment A passerby stops him for directions
and doesnt seem to notice the blood on his sleeve
Klute goes into his apartment

Bree is in the middle of dialing the phone Her
hands are shaking she misdials -- holds down the
receiver for a moment then starts again

INT KLUTES APARTMENT KLUTE - DAY

bleeding) He turns toward the bathroom pulling
his jacket off with the other hand

INT BREES APARTMENT BREE - DAY

Bree speaks to the phone trying to make a simple
point trying to keep her voice even

BREE

She hangs up before the other party can object in
detail -- takes up her purse and goes out not even
closing the door behind her

washcloth reaches for the faucet --

EXT BREES BROWNSTONE - DAY

Bree comes out of door - goes down steps —
hesitates in front of Klutes apartment struggling
with the question of whether to knock CAMERA pulls
back to reveal we are watching her through the
windshield of a car in the parking lot across the
street CAMERA pulls back further to reveal the
back of Cables head as he sits in the car watching
her Bree starts to knock on Klutes door but stops
herself and walks down the street Cables head
moves out of the shot We hear the sound of the car
door opening and closing Through the windshield we
see Cable cross in front of the car and start to
follow Bree down the street

if we want to be accurate - from mid room without
directly approaching the windows themselves) Then
he secures a pistol from his jacket (and folds the
jacket itself over his arm to conceal it as a
matter of public decorum) and goes on out

INT STAIRWELL KLUTE - DAY
Klutes manner over the next few minutes exhibits
an absolute untheatrical care and competence A

man -- Cable -- may in fact be hiding here
somewhere to kill him He sets about checking the
likely places -- first of all the lower hallway

then the stairwell itself moving steadily
unalarmedly up

At the top he notes -- but still without main
concern that Brees door is open He calls ahead --

KLUTE
Bree -—

INT BREES APARTMENT KLUTE - DAY

He enters puzzles starts checking around (quite
thoroughly she might be hiding from him) We CUT

INT STAIRWELL - DAY

Klute comes quickly back downstairs back into his
room takes up the phone Through the still-open
door we watch him begin dialing -- then CUT TO --

INT SPANGLERS (OUTER) OFFICE - DAY

Bree sits isolated on the waiting-room couch She
may have been here for fifteen minutes -- or an
hour She turns the pages of a magazine -- one
handed without even lifting it from the coffee
table with an absolute lack of interest a
mechanical gesture

We hear FOOTSTEPS approaching directly toward where
we are watching Bree sit

LELA (0S)
Mrs Daniel --

WIDER - TWO SHOT

Bree looks up in a kind of frozen terror as the
Secretary smiles nicely -- lovingly down at her

LELA
-- I have to close up now Leave

message service Mrs Daniel and

until he --

BREE
No

(the same tone
completely)
Well Im certain Doctor Spangler

Bree moves to the desk and telephone But we move
with the Secretary as she moves into Spanglers
inner office and switches out the lights
(establishing TIME CHANGE dusk now) and as we

hear OS the sound of DIALING and BREES VOICE --

BREE (0S)

FABER ON PHONE (OFFICE)

FABER
Yes - yes dear yes -- maybe half
an hour sure yes

He hangs up An ancient stirring a kind of
triumph He glances about then tightens his tie
Then it comes to him after all -- he takes note of
himself -- he leans forward against his desk and
rubs his forehead with old bony fingers We CUT TO

INT KLUTES APARTMENT - DAY (NIGHT)
KLUTE on phone

KLUTE

He is interrupted again -- Trask wasting no words
on his end of things -- nods once --

KLUTE (CONTD)
Yeah

-- and depresses the receiver just long enough to
clear the connection and starts dialing again --
We CUT TO --

INT STAIRWAY OF GARMENT BUILDING - DAY (NIGHT)

Quitting time As Bree enters from street level
employees are coming down the stairs pushing past
her She continues up on until at one point -- one
more officious or more communicative than the
others informs her --

FOREMAN
Lady its closing up there

BREE
What

FOREMAN
Were closing up quitting time
Fabers

BREE

(unsurely)

I have an appointment with Mr
Faber

FOREMAN
Oh yeah

He lets her pass glances after her like the
others continues on his way

INT GARMENT BUILDING FABER RECEPTION AREA - DAY
(NIGHT)

Bree arrives at the head of the stairs -- as still
others press past her on their way down -- and
comes more or less directly up against the thickset
RECEPTIONIST She is packing her purse preparing
to depart looks somewhat challengingly at Bree --
who sees no way to avoid the issue

BREE
I have an appointment with Mr
Faber
RECEPTIONIST
In there
(turns bawls)
Mr Faber --

Bree goes on nervously in the direction indicated
toward --

A CORNER OF OFFICES NATHAN FABER

NATHAN stands bending over a bench with back to
camera conferring with another man as Bree
approaches -- looking to us as to her exactly
like his father We hear the Receptionists VOICE
repeating --

RECEPTIONIST (CONTD) (0S)
(CONT D)
Mr Faber --

As Bree nears him he straightens and turns -- a
much younger man Bree stops short recognizing the
error

NATHAN

Yes
BREE

Im sorry -- Mr Faber Senior
NATHAN

(calmly)
My father went home about fifteen
minutes ago he wasnt feeling too
good

She has already started away He calls after her
evenly --

NATHAN (CONTD)
Can I help you

She looks back quickly smiles nervously --

BREE
It wasnt important

But we hold on him for a moment as she continues
out of scene -- until he turns away to other
matters Then --

RECEPTION AREA RECEPTIONIST BREE
Bree returns toward Receptionist awkwardly --

BREE
Did Mr Faber leave a message for
me or anything Mr Faber Senior
Bree Daniel

RECEPTIONIST
Oh I thought that was for
tomorrow

The Receptionist riffles through a stack of

assorted envelopes -- hands one out to Bree -- and
promptly takes her way off Out Bree starts to
open the envelope then and there -- but OTHERS

continue to move past her She seeks a more private
place

ROWS OF GARMENTS
Bree shelters herself out of sight from everyone
else -- though we continue to hear INTERMITTENT
VOICES OS and continue to maintain the sense of
other presences

We see her open the envelope --
CLOSER BREE ENVELOPE

She finds nothing inside but money -- bills
totaling fifty dollars We see her looking for a
message finding nothing It comes to her slowly
that shes been paid off and avoided She bites her
lips in pain She pushes back out of hiding --

RECEPTIONIST AREA

-- back to the reception area again (By now this

immediate scene has emptied though we catch sight
of a figure or two at scene-start moving through

the background and continue to hear an occasional
NOISE or VOICE OS)

Bree looks about for someone -- then scouts for a
pencil finds one in a desk (or bench) drawer
starts to readdress the envelope (to direct it back
to Mr Faber) Then she breaks off from that takes
up a PHONE instead dials -- waits -- then --

BREE

Bree Daniel Has he called in yet
Well if he does Im at --

(reads phone)
-- two seven eight three one
hundred and I guess I can wait
here five minutes then Ill try
from somewhere else

(impatiently)
Just tell him Bree Daniel he knows
who

She hangs up goes back to readdressing the
envelope FOOTSTEPS are approaching in her
direction She glances up apologetically

BREE (CONTD)
Mr Faber I just wanted to leave
this for your father and I
wondered if youd --
She pauses --

ANGLE PAST BREE TO CABLE

Cable hastens toward her along a lane of garments
In this brief glimpse a ludicrous and terrifying
figure -- a noise a gesticulation (actually the
gesture is arms out palms downward intended as a
quieting gesture and the hissing noise is intended
as a shushing) Bree cries out turns to run --

BREE (CONTD)
Someone --

-- as we immediately even as shes turning CUT TO

INT KLUTES APARTMENT KLUTE - DAY (NIGHT)

Klute speaks quietly but with terrible urgency into
the phone (dealing evidently with an ethically
skittish message service at the other end)

KLUTE

Did she leave a number

(beat)
This is a police call dont make
me take time to prove it Did she
leave a number What is the number

(beat)
What is the number --

INT GARMENT BUILDING - DAY (NIGHT)

Cable and Bree They are at some remove from the
site of Cables first appearance there are other
evidences of time-lapse Cables manner is that of
slightly-strained patience -- a civility -- an
attempt now and then to smile Bree watches his
every slight gesture quivers to make a break for
it tries throughout to buy time

CABLE
Cant we talk together reasonably
just -- ordinarily

(beat)

I know youre expecting some kind
of -- extravagant behavior but
believe me -- do you believe me --

BREE
Yes -- all right --

CABLE
-- We can talk --

BREE
-- Yes

CABLE

All right then an ordinary
matter Im a quite well off man I
have a -- position to respect I
would feel personally uncomfortable
to be connected with a -- certain
kind of woman Im sure you
understand Do you Well Id like
to buy Jane McKennas book

He looks at her discerningly She seems not to have
followed his exposition He tries patiently to
clarify it

CABLE (CONTD)
Her black book Jane McKennas her

list of -- of persons I was told
youre negotiating for it on behalf
of --

The PHONE RINGS an explosive noise Bree startles
It has been put on night-ring to sound all over
the loft and the noise is deafening But -- the
most bizarre element is Cables absolute lack of
response to it It rings and rings as he talks and
talks -- in the same expository tone as before
without raising his voice It drowns out most of
his words -- at most we catch only odd phrases of
all the following -- but he seems not to hear it
any more than the clamor of other things torturing
his soul

CABLE (CONTD)

That was what Klute told me -- you
were negotiating for him to buy
that list And Im in a position to
pay a good deal more for it than he
can Do you understand Id like
you to acquire it on my --

(beat)
Miss Daniel do you not understand

(beat)
Miss Daniel I cant tell whether
you understand me

(beat - still reasonably)
Is this something Klute just
invented Is this a trap for me
Miss Daniel does Klute know about
me

He turns and lifts a phone (one of the extension
phones situated around the loft) -- though up to
now hes given no evidence of even hearing the
ringing He just stands holding the phone for a
time then lowers it back on the receiver With a
sort of absolute quiet --

CABLE (CONTD)
You have no idea what Im talking
about

BREE
Yes -- Jane McKennas book -- I
could make a phone call

CABLE
No youre frightened youre
pretending Well -- Klute knows

about me then Does everybody know
can you tell me

BREE
Yes

CABLE
Then it doesnt matter what I do
any more does it

Pause Then he shudders slightly

CABLE (CONTD)
You people know nothing about pain

We CUT TO --
EXT STREETS - DAY (NIGHT)

We see Klute -- probably in MLS -- running along
street He tries for a cab -- misses it -- halts
the next by expedient of cutting bodily in front of
it The Driver starts to lean out to object Klute
mashes him back inside enters the cab We CUT BACK
TO --

INT GARMENT BUILDING - DAY (NIGHT)

MLS the two FIGURES CABLE BREE They are

somewhat separated -- Cable has gone to look down
from one of the arched windows of the loft while
Bree remains in place She is a prisoner we can

suppose -- when we cut closer well see her eyes
continually shifting her mind calculating her
chances -- but he hasnt molested her He bears her

no animus at this point His manner is rather
quiet undetermined He feels some relief that the
thing is in effect over -- and some puzzlement
about what to do (with either her or himself) now
He returns toward her

CLOSER BREE CABLE

Nearing her again he gestures several times
apologetically seeking words

CABLE
Ive got no idea what I shall do
He happens too close she cant avoid shrinking

CABLE (CONTD)
Im not going to hurt you
absolutely Im not

BREE
Will you let me go then

He seems not to have heard the request He sits for
a moment An intellectual interest a curiosity
(Meanwhile perhaps we see her starting to slip
her shoes off in hopes of running)

CABLE
It puzzles me so badly Ive done
terrible things but I cant
consider myself a terrible man
Ive killed three people and Id
still want to say it was accident
do you see

BREE
(tries again slowly)
If youll let me go I could tell

them what --
CABLE
(unhearing resumes)
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we

were here on business together he
discovered me with Jane McKenna
Then I suppose it was the -- the
contempt I saw in his face and the
certainty that sooner or later hed
use it against me Within the
Company I endured that as long as
I could do you see

BREE
Im sorry Im just frightened
Yes

CABLE

Excuse me Miss Daniel

BREE
I said yes I see

CABLE
(doubtingly)
Oh no I dont think --

BREE
Tell me Ill listen
(pause)
I just want you to tell me

He rises approaches her -- apparently taken in
credulous grateful wondering --

CABLE
Youre willing to listen You want
me just to keep talking

He hits her

CABLE (CONTD)
Thats what you do isnt it you
make a man feel accepted
Thats what you all do Your stock
in trade a mans weakness

He hits her again

CABLE (CONTD)
Why dont you ask for mercy My
God what mercy has anyone given
me

EXT GARMENT BUILDING ROOF (DIRECTLY ABOVE FABER
LOFT) - DAY (NIGHT)

Klute has gun out - as he carefully makes his way
across the roof Man in hotel window across street
holding drink - watches him with amused curiosity
Klute spots entrance to stairway

INT GARMENT BUILDING KLUTE - DAY (NIGHT)

Klute goes downstairs to back entrance of Faber
loft He slips inside He hears THE SOUNDS OF THE
BEATING -- a stirring of feet and indistinct impact
sounds a murmur of voices (but all quite muted
undramatic) He maneuvers through lanes of
garments trying to gain a line of sight He
understands whats going on strains to intervene
but cant disclose himself At a point he drops to
hands and knees slides underneath the garment
racks drawing closer to Cable trying to gain
position We intersperse his progress with further
Bree-Cable fragments as for instance --

FRAGMENT CABLE BREE
CABLE

Youre a person of no value you
have no value --
KLUTE SHIFTING CLOSER

Klute works his way steadily closer -- under
steadily increasing pressure as the pursuit and
beating continue as SOUNDS 0S Even close at hand
the noises are ambiguous -- the clatter of
footsteps grunts a slap of flesh -- rather than
distinct Once or twice we hear CABLES VOICE
clearly enough to make out words --

CABLE (CONTD)
-- Is that contempt Is it
(then)
No Im the one who feels contempt
-- and once or twice a CRY from Bree
Klute tries to gain aim --

POV TO BREE CABLE

-- but Cable is too close upon her and they are
too steadily in motion

KLUTE

Klute moves on -- moves on -- gains position --
springs

CABLE

Cable catches the sound whirls screams --

POV TO KLUTE

Klute closes with him knocks loose Cables pistol
- contends for it again knocks it loose again
EFFECT -- under -- SIRENS

CABLE KLUTE

Cable breaks loose backs a step -- backs another
step -- and then turns and runs unhesitant against
one of the windows exploding it outward with him
both frame and glass

We see the body tracing its quick path down the
dark side of the building

EXT DOWNSHOT FROM LOFT TO STREET (KLUTES POV) -

The sound of SIRENS a little LOUDER
INT GARMENT BUILDING KLUTE BREE - DAY (NIGHT)
Klute turns from looking down moves to where Bree

kneels on the floor He hunkers down
In a gentle-enough VOICE but matter-of-factly

withal -- as if to a child --
KLUTE

(pause)
Come on

(Note also shoot in MSL without dialogue with
SIRENS OS full up) Then we CUT TO --

INT KLUTES APARTMENT - DAY

KLUTE is packing to leave We follow him about as
he carries clothing from closet and bureau folds
it into his suitcase on the table We hear the
familiar FOOTSTEPS on the stairs Brees KNOCK He
lets her in keeps on about his business His
expression is sober hers is quite tentative

BREE
Hi

He doesnt at least expel her She ventures in
sits on the table swings her heels watches him
pack His arm impairs him At length --

KLUTE

BREE
Oh

Well it wasnt us city people that

country boy

KLUTE

BREE

KLUTE

Pause She compresses her lips slips down from the
table starts smartly out of the room

KLUTE (CONTD)
Wait

She returns and sits on the table again waits But
Klute doesnt seem about to say anything more --
goes on packing

BREE
Well suppose I hadnt come
downstairs Would you just have
folded up and sneaked away

KLUTE
(slowly)
No I was going to come up I
wanted to ask you to marry me
(pause)

BREE
You wanted to or you are

KLUTE

BREE
You could at least look at me

He complies stands and looks folding a necktie
But now she finds she has to look away Somewhat
brokenly --

BREE (CONTD)
Look -- yes I mean thanks but --
dont you think we better be
realistic

KLUTE
About what

BREE
Look at me Im pretty and sort of
clever and very well intentioned
and dear God Id tear your heart
out

KLUTE
I dont think so

He resumes packing continues through the
following
BREE
How can you not think so You know
the things I can do

KLUTE
(unclearly)
They dont scare me any more

BREE
What

KLUTE
Doesnt scare me I think we could
handle it

Thereafter he guards his silence staunchly goes on
packing as she comes at the thing from various
sharp angles

BREE
Please Im a city person Im sure
its just as good as here but Ima
city person thats all I am
(pause)
Hell I know what its like I was
in Jersey once the frogs go bra-a
p all night

socks and sing in the church choir
(pause choking) )
Do you not believe I love you Im

He has almost finished packing -- returns toward
the suitcase with the tin CLOCK and electric FAN
tries to fit them in as conversation continues

BREE (CONTD)
Look why should it be yes or no
Cant we keep it going and see I
mean we can keep in touch and visit
each other and see People do that
thats realistic

KLUTE
OK

BREE
(bitterly)
You dont believe that either do

KLUTE
Can you use these
He sets the fan beside her hands her the LOUDLY
TICKING clock She holds it in her lap numbly
Hes packed -- closes various drawers leaving in
good order -- snaps the suitcase shut lifts it
stiffly down from the table She remains sitting

BREE
Can I carry something for you to
the car
(he shakes his head)
Will you kiss me

KLUTE
No Im sore

He moves to the door pauses half-smiles --

KLUTE (CONTD)
Well --

She smiles back He goes We hear the entryway door
opening and closing

She slips down off the table We CUT TO --
EXT STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - DAY

Klute is lets say about seventy feet on his way
when she appears at the front door calls after
him

BREE
Hey

He turns around and stops He walks slowly back to
her

CLOSER BREE KLUTE

He arrives in proximity to her Then the following
events in more or less the following order

He looks at her inquiringly She responds by
sitting down plunk on the grubby front step of
the Brownstone

Having stood for some time -- during which she has
offered only twitching motions of her hands -- he
sets down the suitcase

Having set down the suitcase but derived no
answer he reaches out one arm and leans against
the building front

She nearly arrives at the level of statement
Fretfully indecisively --
BREE
Oh heck --
(pause)
Oh heck --

Then aS a man not to be dallied with he picks up
the suitcase again She looks at him strickenly
but it doesnt precipitate her into speech

He puts it down again

And then -- then after all goddamit he reaches
out grabs her wrist and simply hauls her along
suitcase in one hand Bree in the other As she
yanks shouts struggles --

BREE (CONTD)
I havent decided yet
(beat)
I havent decided yet
(beat)
I havent decided yet --
