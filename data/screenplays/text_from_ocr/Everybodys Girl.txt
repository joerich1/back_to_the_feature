EVERYBODYS GIRL
SYNOPSIS

Florence is a shop girl of the quiet sweet clean type She finds it
hard to make ends meet Her more practical more worldly-wise friend
Ella the shoe-store cashier suggests that they share her present
quarters in Brickdust Row--a decaying tenement block By this
division of expense they can both save enough to buy an extra pickle
for lunch once in a while

When Florence sees Brickdust Row she is depressed by its dull
aspect its dreary environment But she accepts Ellas proposal and
the two girls begin their sharing of the tiny room as cheerfully as
possible

Through a terrifying experience with a male flirt Florence comes to
learn that Ella has long been used to accepting attentions and escort
from men outside the home atmosphere Ella explains that since the
owner of Brickdust Row is so avaricious that he allows the parlors
to be rented out no place is provided where the girls may entertain
men properly and so the society of the opposite sex must be sought
and enjoyed here there and everywhere

The idea is repugnant to Florence who is unusually fine in her ideas
of propriety but she comes to see that Ellas way is the only outlet
for youth and the desire for companionship brightness life

She is very choice in her selection of escorts and never permits any
young man she meets to discover even where she lives

The owner of the tenements is a bored money-spoiled young
man--Alexander Blinker His lawyer tries to make him take enough
interest in his tenements to change the leases so that the girls can
have a place to meet gentlemen with the shield of propriety Blinker
is too anxious to get to a golf tournament even to listen

Florence grows used to her réle of Everybodys Girl and while she
is decidedly decorous she learns the arts and affectations of the
street meeting

Blinker has to come to his lawyer in order to sign some important
documents they are not prepared He must stay in the city over
Sunday The idea fills him with disgust he longs for the hunting trip
he has planned In sheer desperation he decides to do that which his
butler considers equivalent to jumping from the window in view of his
social status--Blinker determines to go to Coney Island

His experiences may be imagined as he is pushed and jostled by the
rough-and-ready pleasure-seekers He gets on the boat and is seen by
Florence who regards him as a prospective escort and so conducts
herself that he is virtually forced into conversation and with no
experience to guide him in this strange method of introduction he
manages to bear himself suitably to the end that the two debark at
the island of pleasure-seeking and set out to enjoy themselves
Florence being the guide by virtue of her experience

At first Blinker feels entirely out of his element but Florence shows
him the spirit in which to accept the tinsel and the rude fun-making
He soon comes to like it--and to think very well of the naively
different girl beside him

He is treated like all her other cavaliers at the time and place of
parting--she goes home alone He returns to his apartment with a new
idea of the citys possibilities

at same evening Florence finds an intruder unceremoniously invading
er room--a gang leader who believes the shot he has just fired at

n adversary has been fatal in its effect He tells her his story but
ays he did not do the shooting She believes him and when the police
ome to her door in their search for the culprit she pretends that

e man opposite her at the table is her brother

taney yyH

Later she learns that he has told her a falsehood but she does not
deliver him to justice and when she finds that the man who was shot
is not fatally injured she sends the shielded one away in safety for
which display of her fine sense of loyalty he becomes a veritable
watchdog never intruding his presence upon her but being always near
to observe the quality of the companions she still allows herself

Blinker meets her by appointment the next evening and the faithful
Watchdog follows them to Coney Island vigilant feeling sure than a
man of the evident social status of Blinker can mean no good to a girl
in Florences station

On the boat coming home Blinker tells Florence that he loves her So
accustomed is she to this display of sentimentality in her cavaliers
that she merely laughs He persists and she indicates a belief that
he is just like the rest Mention of the rest awakes question in
Blinker He learns that she meets men indiscriminately He has a
horror of this evidence of what he considers to be moral laxity and
when Florence sees this she is amazed He has met her in the same
way yet he is shocked that she should meet others In justifying her
course she explains what sort of place Brickdust Row is and how the
girls are driven out

A fire is discovered on the boat and in the excitement Blinker and
Florence are separated and the Watchdog is unable to find the girl he
worships She has jumped into the water as the flames drew too close
to her

Later she is found at home by the Watchdog safe though suffering from
shock He discovers that the shock is less from exposure than from her
discovery that Blinker was serious and that he refused to condone her
mode of meeting men

Blinker is visited by his lawyer and in their conversation a
reference to Brickdust Row gives Blinker the knowledge that he is
the owner of that tenement--that it is his own fault which gives rise
to such unconventional practices as Florence has innocently indulged
in It is too late he thinks now--too late to change things His
dream of love is rudely dispelled

However after a visit from the Watchdog in which the gangster
loyally champions Florences character and lays down the law to
Blinker the latter sees Florence again realizing his own great fault
in being too quick to judge--and the reconciliation is made sweeter by
his willingness to have Florence do her will with the remodeling of
the tenement while the Watchdog finds comfort in the smiles of Ella

see the picture you will no doubt observe directorial alterations that
came up during production In that case you will have valuable
experience in seeing the difference between the original--the
script-writers conception--and the directorial interpretation
