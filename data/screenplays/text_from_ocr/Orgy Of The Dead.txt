FADE TO BLACK
FADE IN
EXT HIGHWAY IN WILDERNESS NIGHT

A CONVERTIBLE is driving along a DESERT ROAD LONG SHOTS of
the automobile driving are filmed in bright sunlight The
desert hills are clearly visible in the background with only
a slight darkening to suggest day-for-night but the cars
headlights are on so we clearly understand that it is pitch
black in the dead of night

CUT TO

MEDIUM SHOT - BOB AND SHIRLEY IN CAR NIGHT

BOB and SHIRLEY are seated in the CONVERTIBLE driving through
the night on a date They are searching for an ancient
CEMETERY MEDIUM SHOTS have a pitch black background and dark
shadows across the car

Shirley is leaning over in her seat toward Bob who is
driving

SHIRLEY
We sure picked the wrong night
to find a cemetery Lets turn
back

BOB
No Its on a night like this
when the best ideas come to mind

SHIRLEY
But does it have to be ina
cemetery

BOB
You wouldnt understand Seeing
a cemetery on a night like this
can stir in the mind the best
ideas for a good horror story

SHIRLEY
But therere so many wonderful
things to write about Bob

BOB
Sure there are--and Ive tried
them all Plays love stories
westerns dog stories Huh
now there was a good one that
dog story all about--

SHIRLEY
(interrupting)
But horror stories Why all the
time horror stories

BOB
Shirley I wrote for years
without selling a single word

Bob lets go of the wheel with his right arm and puts it around
Shirley who leans closer against him

BOB

My monsters have done well for
me You think Id give that up
just so I could write about
trees or dogs or daisies
Huhuh--Daisies Thats it
Ill write about my creatures
who are pushing up the daisies

Shirley looks up at Bob and smiles He tilts his head down and
they kiss
BOB
Your puritan upbringing holds
you back from my monsters but
it certainly doesnt hurt your
art of kissing

SHIRLEY
Thats life My kisses are
alive

BOB

Whos to say my monsters
arent alive

LONG SHOT of the car driving down the road
CUT back to MEDIUM SHOT of Bob and Shirley

BOB
All of my books are based on
fact or legend Thats perhaps
why theyre more interesting
and sell in the top spots
SHIRLEY
Well fact or not I dont
see how were going to find
an ancient cemetery in these
mountains tonight I cant
see a thing Lets turn back

BOB
Theres an old cemetery on
this road Ive been there
before

LONG SHOT of car driving up a desert road with a sandy
mountain in the background

SHIRLEY
Im getting the jitters
Lets turn back

BOB
(reluctantly)
Okay

Bob takes his arm from around Shirley and puts it back on the
wheel

BOB
Just as soon as I finda
place wide enough to turn
around
CLOSEUP of CAR INTERIOR - DASHBOARD
CUT BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT - Bob and Shirley

SHIRLEY
Not so fast

We hear sounds of tires squealing on the road
CLOSEUP of car wheel racing along the road
CUT BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT - Bob and Shirley
SHIRLEY
(desperately)

Not so fast

CLOSEUP - CAR PEDALS Bob steps hard on the brake
then pumps the brake repeatedly
CUT BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT - Bob and Shirley Shirley screams
and hides her face with her hands

ZOOM IN on a high dirt bank at the roadside then the screen
swirls and spins quickly to suggest a dizzying automobile
crash

DISSOLVE TO

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Bob and Shirley are lying on their backs unconcsious
on the ground The ground is covered by scattered leaves
Misty fog swirls over them
(beat)

Shirley wakes up and sits upright groggily She looks
around then looks down at Bob She moves toward him and
cradles his head in her lap

DISSOLVE TO

EXT CEMETERY - NIGHT

Cemetery is filled with fog We see a large stone throne
framed by ornate columns with an altar beneath it There
are tombstones in the background and skulls and bones on
the ground

CAMERA PANS RIGHT across a small clearing to the MAUSOLEUM

CRISWELL (VO)
It is said on clear nights
beneath the cold light of the
moon howl the dog and the wolf
and creeping things crawl out
of the slime It is then the
ghouls feast in all their
radiance

The Mausoleum doors creak open on their own and Criswell
quickly stalks out across the clearing hiding his face
behind his long black cape which is held up with his bent
elbow against his face in Dracula fashion

CRISWELL (VO - Continuing)
It is on nights like this most
people prefer to steer clear of
uh Burial Grounds It is on
nights like this that the
creatures are said to appear
and to walk

CUT TO
MEDIUM SHOT CRISWELL CLIMBING ONTO HIS THRONE

Criswell walks up the steps to the altar across the altar
and then sits down on the stone seat He then slowly lowers
his cape from his face and regally looks off to the right
(at his cue card)

CRISWELL
The day is gone the night is
upon us and the moon which
controls all of the underworld
once again shinesin radiant
contentment

(beat)
Come forth come forth o
Princess of Darkness

Criswell repeatedly beckons slowly toward himself with his
right hand staring across the clearing at the mausoleum

The PRINCESS OF DARKNESS is standing in front of the
Mausoleum She walks into the clearing with an entrancing
demeanor her arms outstretched straight in front of her
She is wearing a long black low-cut dress with long open
sleeves The sleeves are lined with red and hang down a
couple feet from her wrists She walks slowly over toward
Criswells throne

The Princess of Darkness stands beside Criswells throne
crosses her forearms in front of her chest and bows toward
him He nods toward her She reaches out and places her
left hand on Criswells right hand

CRISWELL (VO)
Time seems to stand still Not
so the ghouls when a night of
Pleasure is at hand

Criswell continues to hold the Princess of Darknesss hand
and she looks at him seductively

CRISWELL
If I am not pleased by tonights
entertainment I shall banish
their souls to everlasting
damnation

The Princess of Darkness again crosses her arms in front of
her chest and slowly bows to Criswell

CUT TO shot of the FULL MOON with dramatic cymbals crashing
then back

CRISWELL
And who is to be first

The Princess of Darkness claps twice summoning the first of
the nights entertainers These poor souls must dance for
Criswells approval If he is pleased they can continue to
entertain him for centuries but if not they will be banished
to everlasting damnation by the All-powerful Criswell

LONG SHOT OF THE CLEARING Huge flames rise from the ground
in front of the clearing The INDIAN GIRL enters the clearing
and begins to Dance She is wearing a red Native American-
style dress and headband

PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
One who loved flames Her lover
was killed by flames She died
in flames

The INDIAN GIRL DANCE begins

The Indian Girl dances around for awhile then dances away
into the foggy background

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Bob slowly wakes up and sits up Bob and Shirley look
around

EXT GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

The Princess of Darkness points dramatically toward the
mausoleum and begins to speak without moving her lips A
marvel of filmmaking art

PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
(out of sync with picture)
One who prowls the lonely streets
at night in life is bound to prowl
them in eternity

The STREET WALKER DANCE begins The STREET WALKER walks
into the clearing wearing a pink dress and purple feather
boa and beckons with her finger as if to say Come here
Criswell

EXT WOODS NIGHT

At the car accident scene with Bob and Shirley slow jazz
music is audible from the nearby festivities in the cemetery
Bob and Shirley are still sitting on the ground looking
toward the source of the music

CRISWELL (VO)
Ahh the curiousity of youth
on the road to ruin May it
ever be so adventurous

SHIRLEY
Im so frightened

BOB
Well we certainly cant stay
here Cmon

SHIRLEY
Where

BOB
In there

SHIRLEY
It frightens me

BOB
Silly theres nothing in
there to be afraid of

SHIRLEY
Thenthen whats that music

BOB
Thats what I want to find out
We have to get help

SHIRLEY

What help can we possibly find
in the cemetery at this time of
night

BOB
Somethings making that music

SHIRLEY
Im not sure I care to find out
what it is

BOB
All right Dont worry Ill
be right beside you

SHIRLEY
What help will that do if
something in there isnt dead

BOB
Not dead In a cemetery

SHIRLEY
I cant imagine anything dead
playing that music

BOB
Well its probably just the
caretaker and thats exactly
who we want to find Theyll
have a telephone Cmon

Bob helps Shirley up from the ground and leads her into the
thick bushes

EXT CEMETERY NIGHT

Criswell nods repeatedly smiling at the dancer in approval
The Street Walkers clothes have suddenly disappeared

Bob and Shirley creep beneath the bushes crouched down low
They reach the edge of the clearing where Criswell and the
Princess of Darkness are watching the Street Walker Dance

SHIRLEY
Could it be some kind of
college initiation

BOB
Its an initiation all right
but not of a college as you
and I know them Nothing
alive looks like that

SHIRLEY
Cant we get out of here

BOB
Im not sure

SHIRLEY
What do you mean

BOB
Im not sure myself Its
just a feeling Ive had
since the crashLike I
feel a cold chill all over
-Now this

The Street Walker dances with a Skeleton that is hanging by
the door of the mausoleum

The Street Walker dance ends

CRISWELL
I would see for approval the
one who in life worshipped
gold above all else

The Princess of Darkness points dramatically toward the
mausoleum again to start off the next dance

The giants walk to the doors now wearing red and white
horizontal-striped miniskirts (or ancient egyptian garb)
They pull the iron doors open slowly and we see the GOLD
GIRL DANCER lying on her back on the altar inside

SHIRLEY
(pointing toward the mausoleum)
Look

BOB

Be careful--They1ll see you

The Gold Girl Dancer rises slowly and seductively from the
table then stalkingly dances out into the clearing She is
wearing a metallic gold tunic-like dress

We see a shot of Bob and Shirley watching and suddenly the
Gold Girls dress has disappeared

The Gold Girl Dance continues

CRISWELL
Throw gold at her

The giants pick up a bucket of gold doubloons and begin
slowly sprinkling them over the Gold Girl as she dances
She sits on the ground and reaches for the falling coins

CRISWELL
More gold
The giants continue dropping gold coins on the Gold Girl
She picks up the gold coins rubbing them over her body

in ecstasy

For all eternity she shall

he Princess of Darkness laughs in acknowledgement then
laps her hands twice commanding the Giants to finish the
eremony

he Giants walk toward the Gold Girl who is still on the
round playing with the gold coins and rubbing them on her
ody The giants pick up the Gold Girl who resists trying
o maintain contact with the gold She reaches for it as
hey lift her up

LOSEUP of a BUBBLING GIANT CAULDRON full of a substance that
s supposed to look like gold

he Giants dip the Gold Girl feet first into the cauldron
ubmerging her entire body

few seconds later the giants lift the Gold Girl out of the
auldron Her body is now entirely gilded and she is stiff
hey lift her onto their shoulders carrying her like a board
alking in front of Criswells throne then back into the
ausoleum laying her body on the altar

e see Bob and Shirley looking dismayed

CRISWELL (VO)
And both couldnt help but
remember a line from one of
Bobs stories A sudden wind
howls The night things are
all about me Every shadow a
beckoning invitationto
disaster I know I should
think of other things of
pleasant things but I cant
How can I think of other things
of pleasant things when I am
in a place surrounded by
shadows and objects which can
take any shape here in the
darknessAny shape my mind
can conceive

Deep in the woods we see THE WOLF MAN and THE MUMMY walking
quickly

Suddenly Bob and Shirley are grabbed from behind by the WOLF
MAN and the MUMMY The Wolf Man and The Mummy drag Bob and
Shirley over to the clearing near Criswells throne

The Princess of Darkness is now seated at Criswells right
side with him on his throne

CRISWELL
Bring em in

The Princess of Darkness stands and walks to the end of the
altar below Criswells throne then sits on the lower seat at
the end of the altar and crosses her legs

The Wolf Man and The Mummy drag Bob and Shirley over to the
center of the clearing to face Criswell The Sole Ruler of
the Dark World

CRISWELL
They are live ones

THE MUMMY
(with audible tape hiss added)
Yes Master

CRISWELL
Live ones where only the dead
should be

THE MUMMY
Yes Master and we caught
them him and me

The Mummy motions toward the Wolf Man

THE WOLF MAN
WWWWOOOOOOAAAAAAAUUUUUGGGGHHHHAHAAAA

CRISWELL
You shall both be rewarded
(To Princess)
My Dear Empress of the Night
put these intruders to the
test

Medium Shot of Princess of Darkness (Suddenly the Princess
of Darkness is beside the throne again several feet from the
seat at the foot of the altar)

PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
But they are not yet one of us

CRISWELL
(happily)
A situation easily remedied

PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
Tie them that they may watch

CUT back to long shot of the entire throne and throne altar
The Princess of Darkness is now seated again at the end of
the altar

The Wolf Man and The Mummy tie Bob and Shirley to very tall
grave stones

CUT to medium-close shot of Princess of Darkness whose chest
is heaving excitedly as she grips the handle of the long
sacrificial dagger tucked into the belt at her waist

SHIRLEY
(desperately to Criswell)
Fiend Fiend

PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
To love the cat is to be
the cat

Criswell motions toward The Princess of Darkness who then
walks back up onto the altar and then sits down beside
Criswell again

The CAT GIRL DANCE begins

CRISWELL
(jovially)
A pussycat is born to be
whipped

The Cat Girl Dance ends
CRISWELL

(excitedly)
It will please me very much
to see the Slave Girl with
her tortures

CUT TO interior of the stone mausoleum The Ancient Egyptian
SLAVE GIRL is chained from her wrists to a high hook on the
wall One of the giants pretends to whip her with a cat

o nine tails

CUT back to CRISWELL

CRISWELL

(excitedly)
Torture Torture It
pleasures me

The slave girl pulls with all her might and the chains
suddenly pop off the hook She then pushes the iron doors
open and dances out into the clearing

The Slave Dance concludes

SHIRLEY
Im so frightened

BOB
Youve got a right to be
Were trapped by a bunch of
fiends

SHIRLEY
Those creatures

BOB
Dont let them hear you

SHIRLEY
What can we do

BOB
I dont know I just dont
know But dont give up
Were not finished yet

Shirley closes her eyes and sighs

BOB
Easy Shirley Easy Panic
wont do us any good Let
me think Weve got to
stall for time

SHIRLEY
Im afraid Ill faint

BOB
Whatever you do dont do
that

The Camera zooms back and we see that the Wolf Man and The
Mummy are hiding behind Bob and Shirley The Wolf Man has
his hand up to his ear so he can hear what Bob and Shirley
are saying

The Wolf Man and The Mummy then creep over toward Criswells
throne

The Wolf Man whispers into The Princess of Darknesss ear while
The Mummy and Criswell watch

The Princess of Darkness gets up from the throne and walks over
to Shirley Shirley grimaces The Princess of Darkness
unbuttons Shirleys blouse then marks Shirleys abdomen with

a red (blood) cross using her long sharp fingernail

Shirley screams

The Princess of Darkness pulls her long dagger out of her belt
and raises it staring into Shirleys eyes Suddenly Criswell
yells

CRISWELL
HOLD

The Princess of Darkness pauses and looks back at Criswell

CRISWELL
Let her continue to learn
The time is not yet right
that they should join with
us

The Princess of Darkness reluctantly puts her dagger back in
her belt and tucks Shirleys blouse back in

The Princess of Darkness walks back to Criswells throne
He pulls a human skull out from behind his seat

CRISWELL
And what is this

PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
A symbol Master

CRISWELL
What kind of symbol

PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
She loved the bull ring

and the matador She
danced to their destruction
Now she dances to her own
destruction Her dance is
of skulls

The Princess of Darkness takes the skull from Criswell and
throws it dramatically into the clearing

The MEXICAN DANCE (SKULL DANCE) ensues

CRISWELL
She came to us on the Day of
the Dead

PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
El Dia De Los MuertosA
celebration in her country

CRISWELL
Her dance has pleased me

The Princess of Darkness snaps her fingers starting the
HAWAIIAN DANCE (SNAKE DANCE)

PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
With the loss of her lover
this one cast herself into
the Volcanos fire

A couple times during the dance there are abrupt cuts to
STOCK FOOTAGE of a rattlesnake in a bright daylight shot in
tall dry grass (Looks like it was from a documentary)

CRISWELL
She was

PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
As I said a worshipper of
snakes and of smoke and
flames

CRISWELL
Oh yes a religion of sorts
PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
It would seem so Master

Hawaiian Dance continues then cut to The Mummy and The Wolf
Man

THE MUMMY
I dont like snakes I remember
the one Cleopatra used Cute
little rascal until it flicked
out that red tongue and those
two sharp fangs Youd never
think such a little thing
packed such a big wallop

THE WOLF MAN

THE MUMMY

THE WOLF MAN

The Hawaiian Dance ends

CRISWELL
She pleases me Permit her to
live in the World of the Snakes
(audible cue card flip)

CRISWELL
(continuing after finding his place on the next cue card)
Now I will talkto The
Wolf Manand The Mummy

PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
As you wish Master

The Princess of Darkness motions for The Wolf Man and The Mummy
to come

THE MUMMY
He wants us

THE WOLF MAN
Aaahhnnnahnnnn

THE MUMMY
What do you suppose for

THE WOLF MAN
Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh

THE MUMMY

THE WOLF MAN
Aannnnaahhnn

THE MUMMY
Did you howl off-key at
the moon again

THE WOLF MAN
Aannnnaahhnn

THE MUMMY
I cant remember doing
anything wrong either

PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
COME

THE MUMMY
We better go before we
make him mad

The Wolf Man and The Mummy walk over to Criswells Throne
THE MUMMY

(apprehensively)
We are your servants Master
The Wolf Man bows to Criswell

CRISWELL
Of course you are

The Wolf Man and the Mummy crouch in fear as they face
Criswell

THE MUMMY
Have we in some way made
you angry Master

CRISWELL
You know better than that

THE MUMMY
We dont know of anything
Master

CRISWELL
Then why do you shake so

THE MUMMY
Its not often an Emperor
like you calls on creatures
like us

CRISWELL
Well rest easy Im not
angry with either of you

THE MUMMY
(relieved)
Aaaahhhh

The Mummy Sighs in relief and the Wolf Man nods

THE MUMMY
Then it is some service you
desire of us

CRISWELL
You are the keepers of the
Damned You two know them all
And I am tired of this usual
type of entertainment
I wanta decided change

PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
The moonis soon gone

The Princess of Darkness points up at the full moon
PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
There is little time left for
the remainder of the evenings
pleasures

The Princess of Darkness gets up from the seat at the end of
the altar and walks around beside Criswells throne

CRISWELL
Yes yes yes I know all that

PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
At the first sight of the
morning suns rays we must
be gone

CRISWELL
I suppose most of the others
will have to wait for their
judgement until after the next
full moon

PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
It would seem so Master

CRISWELL
Ahh but I declare there is
still time for something

THE MUMMY

There are one or two which
should complement the nights
entertainment Master

CRISWELL
Ahh good Then I will
see them Dismiss the rest

THE MUMMY
Yes sir Master

Bobs hands are wiggling trying to loosen the rope binding
his wrists behind his back around the stone column

BOB
The ropes are coming loose

SHIRLEY
Be careful

BOB
I am--Its our only chance

SHIRLEY
Nothing is worth your life

BOB
My guess is if we dont
take the chance pretty soon
were not going to have much
life left anyway

SHIRLEY
Im frightened Im so
frightened

BOB
Hold on just a little
longer Shirley

SHIRLEY
Be careful oh please be
careful Well never get
out of here alive I know
it I just feel it

BOB
You do

SHIRLEY
Yes I feel it in my bones

BOB
Youre talking nonsense

SHIRLEY
Oh no Im not These
heathens probably have
an open grave for us

BOB
They wouldnt dare put
us in the same grave--
or would they

SHIRLEY
I should hope not I
hate you

BOB
That sudden

SHIRLEY
Yes that sudden If it werent
for you we wouldnt be hunting
for an old cemetery on a

night like this Its all

your fault

BOB

(dejected)
And I thought you loved me

The Princess of Darkness is leaning over covering her mouth

and whispering into Criswells ear looking over her hand back

at Shirley

CRISWELL
Not yet I perhaps have other
plans for such a pretty one
No matter I will tell you when
and if you may have her

The Princess of Darkness crosses her forearms and bows to
Criswell

PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
The Wolf Man informs me that
the next one is the woman who
murdered her husband on their
wedding night Now she dances
with his skeleton

The SKELETON DANCE begins

The SKELETON DANCE GIRL wearing a white dress and long
wedding veil comes into the clearing with a skeleton She
dances with the skeleton then dances in the clearing for
Criswell

The Skeleton Dance concludes

CRISWELL

(to Shirley)
Have you not enjoyed the
evenings festivities

Shirley is silent and looks downward
CRISWELL
Ahh that will soon change

when you become one of us

The Wolf Man leans back and howls (He tilts his head back

so
far his fake rubber wolfman mask comes up and you can see his
skin at the bottom of his neck)

THE WOLF MAN
WWAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAHHGGGGHHHAAAA-
AAAAAAAAAHHGGGGGHHHHHHHhhhhhh

CRISWELL
It would seem that The
Wolf Man would have you
for his own

SHIRLEY
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

CRISWELL
I have promised both The
Wolf Man and The Mummy a
reward It could be that
you are that reward

SHIRLEY
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

CRISWELL
You need not worryNot just
now anyway

BOB
Leave her alone you fiend

CRISWELL

Fiend is it You will not
be so fortunate Your
existence will cease within
moments No one wishes to
see a man dance

(looking at Shirley)
And you my dear will entertain
for centuries to come

BOB
If I could get my hands on
you
CRISWELL
-Oh You could do nothing
(to Shirley)

I can save you much pain

BOB
Leave her alone I tell you
CRISWELL
(to Shirley)
I do not joke in my proposal

PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
She is to be mine It is so
spoken

CRISWELL
The Princess of Darkness would
have you for her own to join us
through extreme pain
(beat)
Yet am inclined for one as
lovely as you to be more lenient
I have but to touch you with my
finger and it would mean the end
of you all over quickly and
painlessly

SHIRLEY
No No No

CRISWELL
I repulse you Very well It
seems you have chosen your own
fate Live with it I should
say die with it

Bob looks down somberly then looks over at Shirley

BOB
Ive got the ropes loose now
Ive got my hands free Be
careful--Dont change your
expression too much They
must not catch on

SHIRLEY
What can we do against them

BOB
I dont know yet Well
just have to watch our chance
When it comes Ill know what
to do--I hope Ill know what
to do

SHIRLEY
I still dont know what ever
made me go steady with a
crackpot writer like you

BOB
All right Put it on heavy

SHIRLEY
My old boyfriend Tommy would
never have gotten me ina
mess like this At least hes
got brains

BOB
Him Ill bet he sleeps
with all the lights on

SHIRLEY
Maybe so

CUT TO shot of The Mummy talking to The Wolf Man

THE MUMMY
I could make her another
Cleopatra

PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
(looking at Shirley)

The FLUFF DANCE Girl dances for approval

CRISWELL

climax to an evenings enter-
tainment You musthurry
now

The Princess of Darkness begins ceremoniously dancing with
her long sacrificial dagger slowly moving toward shirley
gazing back at Criswell seductively She finally gets to
Shirley and cuts the button off of Shirleys shirt which
was so tight it was about to burst open anyway She unsnaps
the front of Shirleys bra

Bob sees his chance and makes his attempt at a move merely
stepping forward He is instantly hammer-fisted on the back
of the neck by The Wolf Man and falls down unconscious

The Princess of Darkness raises her long dagger high above
Shirleys head But suddenly the sun rises (it is already
high overhead) and the night creatures lose their power The
Princess of Darkness clings to Shirleys arm as she slowly
sinks down to the ground losing all strength
The Camera pans around showing Shirley and Bobs faces then
back to the ghouls all of whom have turned to steaming
skeletons Only their clothing and bones remain

Quick Zoom in on Criswells throne Criswells steaming
skeleton still sits surveying the cemetery wearing his cape

FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN
EXT WOODS - MORNING

At the clearing in the woods near the car wreck Bob and
Shirley are lying on their backs on the ground just as they
were after the crash before they got up to investigate the
strange music that led them to the ghouls

There are two DOCTORS examining Bob and Shirley

In the foreground we see a REPORTERs shoulder and hands
He is writing down details of the accident in a small paper
pad

DOCTOR 1
Easy Miss everythings
gonna be alright

SHIRLEY
Bob Bob

DOCTOR 1
Hes right here beside you
Hell be alright too

The reporter walks around and crouches beside Shirley and
DOCTOR 1 and continues writing in his pad

A Newspaper PHOTOGRAPHER crouches in the foreground to get a
shot of the accident scene and victims

SHIRLEY
Where are they where did
they go They tried to kill
me

DOCTOR 2
Whats this you say Who
was going to kill you

SHIRLEY
The ghouls--they all turned
into skeletons

DOCTOR 2
Take it easy Miss

DOCTOR 1
What she needs is a good
rest

SHIRLEY
Its true I tell you its
true They all turned into
skeletons She-she cut me
here

Shirley points to her abdomen where The Princess of Darkness
had made the X with her fingernail

NURSE crouches down and pulls out a length of medical tape
then hands it to the doctor She cuts another piece of
tape but the Doctors dont realize this and leave her
hanging

DOCTOR 1
Probably was bruised in the
crash

DOCTOR 2
You know you two were very
lucky

SHIRLEY

I love you Bob I really do
Forgive me

BOB
Theres nothing to forgive
It was all a dream

SHIRLEY
You love me then

BOB
Of course I do

The doctors put Shirley onto a stretcher while the photographer
takes more pictures They put her into the back of an
ambulance

Then after the doctor listens to Bobs neck with a stethoscope
Bob just gets up and walks into the back of the ambulance
CRISWELL (VO)
As it is with all the Night
People they are destroyed
by the first rays of the sun
But upon the first appearance
of the deep shadows of the
night and when the moon is
full they will return to
rejoicein their evil lust
and take back with them any
mortal who might happen along

CUT TO

INT MAUSOLEUM MORNING
Criswell is back in his coffin sitting upright

CRISWELL
Yes they were lucky those two
young peopleMay you be so
luckyBut do not trust to
luck at the full of the moon
when the night is darkMake
a wide path around the unholy
groundsof the Night People
Who can say that we do not
exist-Can you

But now we return to our
graves and you

(pointing at audience)
may join us soon

Criswell reclines back into his coffin crossing his arms and
returning to the slumber of the undead

THE END
