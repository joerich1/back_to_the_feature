“THE KEEP

EXT DINU PASS - WIDE - DAY

Sheer mountain walls a thousand feet high on either
side of the pass are slate grey granite The pouring

‘rain washes in darker more reflective rivulets down

the stone It is impossibly steep jagged slabs with
narrow ledges and precipitous drops A few stunted
and bare trees We hear the deep RUMBLE of VEHICLES
HOLD nothing Then

with German markings on the front rumbles along the

ledge halfway between the raging stream and the floor

of the pass twenty feet below and the top of the gran-
ite a thousand feet above Following Woermanns com-
mand car are two trucks carrying soldiers and weapons

All vehicles bear German World War II markings

INT ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER (APC) - WOERMANN - DAY

WOERMANN is dark haired scarred and battle-weary The
consummate combat veteran His grey Wehrmacht uniform
is rumpled and unbuttoned He won the iron cross in
the First World War but doesnt wear it A Hamburg
dockworkers son and a member of the Spartacist Bund
in his youth he took part in the 1918-1919 mutiny of
the German soldiers and sailors against the right win
militarists e end of the war Hefought e
si itt against’ the ‘British Frene san
and rearmed German police that put down and smashed
the nascent Hamburg Soviet Like many rank and file
members of the German Social Democratic Party after
it was smashed between 193337 Woermann ironically
found himself drafted into the Third Reichs Wehrmacht

OVER WOERMANNS SHOULDER THE PASS
winds through the brown-grev wet granite down the

precipitous ledge Across the gorge the escarpment
begins to jut out into a slab of rock Just then

ise

FLASH OF LIGHTNING

and a BLAST of THUNDER rages and reverberates dying

into a RUMBLE through the narrow confines of the gran-

ite gorge

WOERMANN
reacts not at all Repeated squalls swooping through
the pass spear LIGHTNING in all directions They

threaten to bring the mountains down with their thunder
None of it disturbs the battle-weary ennui of this man

closing and opening his eyes in the agony of maintaining
wakefulness Lutz is on the far right side of the
FRAME OUT OF FOCUS beyond him in the distance of
