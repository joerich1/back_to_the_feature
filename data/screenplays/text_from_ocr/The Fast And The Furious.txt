Patton found out He ambushed your

INT BRIANS 240SX (MOVING) - DAY 231
The car rockets forward Brian ignores the gages and
LISTENS to the engine Time seems to slow as Brian finally
finds that special zone

His face reflects a serenity we havent seen before

It seems like forever as he clutches and shifts into third
Just as perfect as can be He can almost hear each

individual GEAR in the transmission The car is SPEAKING to
him as none have before

from his engine Computer car and driver have become a
trinity of acceleration
