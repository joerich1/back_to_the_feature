FADE IN
A WORN SATCHEL (MOVING - DAY)

is being carried by a world weary middle European wearing a black
armband VLADIMIR NEKHORVICH exits a gleaming building pausing
for a moment under a motto clearly visible above his head
Where the future is now He checks the time

INSERT - WATCH

set in Countdown Mode Its at 19 hours forty-seven minutes and
sixteen seconds and dropping 193715 14 13 12 etc

OS children are singing

Ring a ring a rosya pocketful of posy
a tissue a tissuewe all fall down

Nekhorvich looks to see children at play outside the adjacent
Natural History Museum They are moving in and around an odd

freeform sculpture

POV - SCULPTURE AND CHILDREN
a blur where the sculpture seems to be distorting the children
almost like mirrors in a fun house

NEKHORVICH
wipes his eyes a horn honks He looks toward the sound
MOVING SHOT - SATCHEL (INT AIRPORT SECURITY - DAY)

on the belt that takes it thru X-Ray On the other side a guard
opens the satchel and pokes thru a few toilet articles personal
items books a battleship gray digital camera and - in a small
plastic container marked SG - a small square shiny object
hi-tech and at odds with the other items She pulls out an urn-
shaped vessel

GUARD
Whats this then

NEKHORVICH
(handing her documents)
The ashes of a colleague Im taking them
to his family If you wish to open it
please be careful

COMPUTERIZED SCREEN DISPLAY (INT PLANE - MOVING - DAY)

on the cabin wall displays a colorful map showing the flight
point of departure in Sydney continuously updating distance
direction and time to its ultimate destination Atlanta Georgia

CAPTAINS VOICE
- folks were a little over two anda
half hours from touchdown in Atlanta but
if you look out your windows on either
side of the aircraft well soon be
crossing the southern section of the Rocky
Mountains a range which includes more
than 50 peaks rising above 14000 feet
The chains loftiest point Mount Elbert
at 14 433 feet should be coming into view
as we pass over central Colorado shortly

NEKHORVICH (INT CABIN - DAY)

seems intent on the map its changing times and distance He
checks his watch - the countdown has gone from 20 to three hours
and 32 minutes as Nekhorvich is mesmerized by the descending
seconds whipping by

ETHAN HUNT sits into shot on the vacant first class aisle seat
beside Nekhorvich

ETHAN
You keep staring at that watch as if your
life depended on it Doctor

NEKHORVICH
Well yes I suppose I am a bit anxious

ETHAN
Theyre ready and waiting Youll soon be
with old friends

NEKHORVICH
(meaning Ethan)
Im with an old friend now Dmitri

ETHAN
Sorry it couldnt be under happier
circumstances

NEKHORVICH
Yes Im sorry too Youre sorry and Im
sorry

(bemused laughter then looks at Ethan)
- you do know Gradski thought the world of you

Nekhorvich is overcome Ethan puts a comforting hand on his
shoulder

ETHAN
He was quite a man Did he know before
the end you two had succeeded

NEKHORVICH
Yes he knew Just

ETHAN
--not in time to save him

NEKHORVICH
No After youve lived with Chimera for
twenty hours nothing can save you Not
even Bellerophon

Nekhorvich pats the satchel

ETHAN
You carry them together Safely

With an almost impish grin and a wink
NEKHORVICH
Yes and youll get us to a safe place
with them thank godleft to my own
devices Im an old fart too inept to read
a railroad timetable

Good-natured laughter Cut off by a flight steward who passes

by giving a sidelong silence in Ethan and Nekhorvichs
direction

Oxygen masks suddenly deploy from the ceiling Passengers are

puzzled and alarmed

CAPTAINS VOICE
You Captain again Weve experienced a
slight but abrupt drop in cabin pressure

A passenger struggling with his mask As Nekhorvich fumbles with
the strap on his mask he notes that the display screen shows
their altitude is below 30000 feet and dropping He checks the
countdown time on his watch again Nekhorvich looks around him
The flight attendants are conspicuously absent and all the
passengers who have on oxygen masks are passed out

INT - COCKPIT
The flight crew now wearing their oxygen masks

CAPTAIN
(into radio)

Pan pan pan Denver Center This is
Trans Pac Flight two-two-zero-seven 747
heavy We are not reading you Were
unable to maintain cabin pressurization
We have initiated a descent to one six
thousand

The Co-pilot is working on the planes altitude when his hands
slip off the controls His eyes flutter then

CO-PILOT
Captain I dontcant

He passes out The Captain HUGH STAMP turns to verify that the
relief pilot is also unconscious at the controls

He then removes his oxygen mask sets the auto pilot inputting
numbers to slow the plane and descend As the craft titles
downward

INT - GALLERY

The flight attendants are pulling on jump suits Stamp emerges
from the cockpit
INT - CABIN

Ethan returns Nekhorvich beckons to him Ethan sits Grinning
around Nekhorvich conspiratorially

NEKHORVICH
it seems we have a problem Dmitri

ETHAN
(in the same tone)
You keep calling me Dmitri You really
shouldnt

Nekhorvichs eyes narrow

NEKHORVICH
Youre not Dmitri

With a lightning swift move Ethan breaks Nekhorvichs neck

ETHAN
- no

He grabs the satchel

ETHAN (contd)
(to Wallis)
Wallis hold onto it

Wallis slashes the satchel handle open takes the satchel for
Ambrose He peels off the latex mask revealing SEAN AMBROSE

ETHAN (contd)
Ulrich pull the -

He tears off the vocal oscillator at his adams apple clears his
throat now as Ambrose

AMBROSE
- pull the NO2 tank and dump it its potential
evidence

STAMP
(the captain into shot)
All done chief

AMBROSE
(what else)
- right -
(kidding)
- dont go too far ahead of me now â€”-

STAMP
Not possible

Ulrich has rolled back the carpet over an access panel just
beneath them that leads to the belly of the plane Stamp pulls
back the panel hops into the compartment below which is four
walls of electronic equipment Stamp kneels and slides back the
floor hatch The wind howls puffs of cloud zip by beneath them
As they descend into the belly

WALLIS
Checkpoint Charlie plus 30 altitude minus
two-zero-thousand Airspeed one-seven-
niner knots

AMBROSE
Its that time Go

They don goggles and with Ambrose in the lead
the team leaps one after another from the hatch sailing off
into the sky

INT - COCKPIT (DAY)
An automated voice repeats in an ominous monotone

VOICE
Terrain terrain Pull up pull up

The co-pilot stirs He blearily rouses himself just in time to
see

A mountain rushing toward him As mountain meets airplane the
frame is filled with fire but when camera pulls back from the
fireball it is in fact no more than a match head filling frame
which ignited lights a fuse

The MI theme music kicks in the main credits roll to
EXT - FACE OF MOUNTAIN (DAY)

For a moment it might be thought part of the same range when the
plane crashed but when Ethan Hunt climbs into frame the angle
widen and titles down revealing more of where hes come from
than where hes going Aside from the fact that hes in the
midst of free-climbing what is easily a sheer rock face of at
least a thousand feet theres the sunny picture-postcard view of
a lovely valley and pellucid lake thousands of feet below Ethan
climbs out of shot

his

To

WIDE UP ANGLE (DAY)

revealing the summit a light breeze hitting the lichen and
whatever growth has a slender purchase on the rocky mountainside
fluffy clouds overhead

Ethan into shot Despite the spectacularly precarious handholds
hes using to hang onto the mountain and his life he appears
relaxed engaged - for him - in the equivalent of busmans
holiday Its leisurely danger for Ethan one might almost
expect to hear Julie Andrews trilling Climb Every Mountain on
the soundtrack

Then a rock hes been grasping crumbles and Ethan drops about six
inches before he grabs onto the mountain again As he hangs by
five fingers thousands of feet above the earth he doesnt seem
terribly concerned until he spots a helicopter

Its materialized behind the summit and passes surprisingly close
just overhead casting its shadow downward over Ethan
Instinctively Ethan flattens himself against the rock surface
as if the copter poses some sort of threat to him But when

its rotors whir it into the distance Ethan relaxes and resumes

climb
A HAIRY OVERHANG (EXT MOUNTAIN - DAY)

near the summit Ethan departing from the vertical and is now
traversing the mountain with more of his back than his feet
exposed to the earth far below Hes clinging to the mountain
almost like a fly walking on the ceiling When he reaches for a
handhold that will restore him to the vertical he dislodges a
lizard - and manages to catch it before it plunges thousand of
feet to oblivion

ETHAN
Whoaa

He pockets the lizard climbs the overhang

REVERSE ANGLE - SUMMIT

with Ethans hand then Ethan coming into view and making the
summit He reaches into his pocket and releases the lizard who
favors Ethan with a stern reptilian stare by way of gratitude

lizard

ETHAN
Youre welcome
The lizard scampers off then a low beeping sound at his back
attracts his attention He turns to see the source of the
beeping a small package in day-glo colors with a day-glo
streamer Ethan looks to the sky where the helicopter is now
ominously circling back

Ethan lifts the day-glo package and waves it in the direction of
the copter With a distinct lack of enthusiasm

The helicopter once again turns banks and disappears Ethan has
opened the beeping package and finds a pair of sunglasses

ETHANS POV SUNGLASSES
First a retinal scan

ELECTRONIC VOICE
Identity confirmed

SWANBECK
Good morning Mr Hunt

Swanbecks face flashes onscreen Over his introduction of Nyah
is a series of satellite photographs whose subject is so elusive
she never seems to give the camera a clean shot

SWANBECKS VOICE
Your mission should you choose to accept
it requires you to recover a stolen item
designated Chimera Essential to the
mission is the recruitment of a civilian --
a Miss Nyah Nordoff-Hall She is a highly
capable professional thief currently
active in Spain

A series of Nyahs accomplishments ie warrants complaints
Interpol summaries of her various criminal activities as well as
glimpses of the elusive Nyah circulating about Seville

SWANBECKS VOICE (contd)
Her dossiers available on I-COM 3 You
have 48 hours to recruit Ms Nordoff-Hall
and meet me in Seville to receive further
details Should you or any member of your
IM force be caught or killed the
Secretary will disavow all knowledge of
your actions

Swanbecks face reappears on screen

SWANBECKS VOICE (contd)
And Mr Hunt - the next time you go on
vacation please be good enough to let us
know where youre going This message will
self-destruct in five seconds

Ethan removes the glasses then tosses them into space

ETHAN
If I let you know where Im going -

The glasses explode in a puff of smoke

ETHAN (contd)
- wont be on holiday

Ethan with a fair amount of disgust gets to his feet and jumps
off the mountain in what for a moment looks like a suicidal
snit Then somewhere hundreds of feet below camera theres a
little puff of color as the tulip-shaped chute pops out of his
back-pack Begin the sound of a castanets and the animal-like

cries

EVE)

of flamenco dancers

DISSOLVE TO

EXT - ANDALUSIAN VILLA (EVE)

Bustling in the activity of a large private party with arriving
guests and attentive valets as a young woman her face unseen
exits her car and enters the villa

A FLASH OF SKIRT AND LACE (INT-EXT VILLA - FLAMENCO DANCERS -

where to the cries of dancers add graceful feminine hands
wielding the castanets The dancers perform on a raised platform
and NYAH NORDOFF-HALLS face can be glimpsed thru the swirling
skirts and pounding heels looking thru not at them

REVERSE ANGLE - ETHAN

looking back in a similar way to Nyah surreal lighting and the
relentless chorus of pounding heels seem to isolate them in the
crowed party Nyah continues to look at Ethan over the shoulder
over her wanna-be escort a very attentive gentleman Nyah
offers up her empty glass and the gentleman eagerly takes it to
the bar for a refill leaving Nyah and Ethan looking at one
another Ethan approaches her

ETHAN
Do you know me

NYAH
No Should I

ETHAN
No You just looked as if you did

NYAH
No Just as if Id like to

ETHAN
Oh Well I think that can be arranged

NYAH
Not tonight Bad timing Sorry -

ETHAN
Theres not enough time in the world for
any of it to be bad

This stops her Nyah moves closer to him until theyre nose
to nose Whispered but breezy

NYAH
Look its either you or the rent and I
dont mind telling you its not an easy
choice

ETHAN
What if I pay the rent

NYAH
Uh-huh

ETHAN

Uh-huh

Glancing at the gentleman making his way back with her drink
then

NYAH
Go find the wealthy lady you came with and
next time we meet - Ill pay your rent

(kissing him sweetly)
Now bugger off

And purposeful creature that she is she takes her frustrated
desire upstairs timing her footsteps so as to use the sound of
the dancers steps to cover her own Once upstairs a security
guard near the master bedroom can be seen eagerly following her
down the hall both moving past a pair of windows visible to
Ethan In a few moments Nyah can be seen past the

windows in the opposite direction without the guard following
In another moment or two a very puzzled looking security guard
can be glimpsed in the first window looking up and down the
hall clearly having lost sight of Nyah Ethan smiles moves out
of shot

INT - MASTER BEDROOM (EVE)
Nyah has opened the door and moves swiftly thru the bedroom
INT - BATH (EVE)

A decadent looking affair with suggestive lighting mirrored
walls The tub has a tray across it which includes a wine cooler
chilling a bottle of Crystal and a mound of caviar on a bed of
ice Nyah cant resist She spoons a dollop of the caviar and
downs it before she moves along the frescoed walls of the tub to
its back There she pulls out her compact and removes the puff
revealing an electronic density meter She turns it on and holds
it at the rear of the tub Its sweep gauge jumps sharply from
green thru yellow and into red

NYAH
(her fondest hopes confirmed)
Mmmm

She now steps into the tub and focuses on the grout between the

tiles just above the sop dish Her knee eyes search for any

cracks in the grout and she spots one Using a tweezers she

pulls the silver of the grout out from between the tiles
revealing

something that looks like a credit card wedged between the tiles

She slips the card into a narrow opening under the sop dish

Theres the sound of hydraulics and two arms move the marble
casing out from the rear of the tub Nyah breathes a sigh of
relief and anticipation kneeling in the tub she finds herself
looking down at an open safe revealing some half-dozen locked
compartments As she studies them

ETHAN
Decisions decisions

Nyah looks up to see Ethans reflection in the bathroom
mirrors looking down at her kneeling in the tub

NYAH
What are you doing here

ETHAN
Think youre the only one who can pick a

lock

NYAH
(not altogether pleased)
I see Youre not just another pretty face

Before Ethan can answer a voice can be heard coming from the
bedroom warbling Granada in Spanish and with considerable gusto

NYAH (contd)
Oh god A bloody baritone

Nyah catches a reflection behind Ethans in the bathroom mirror
She reaches up and grabs Ethan by the lapel yanking him into the
tub pulling him down on top of her Once again theyre nose to
nose

ETHAN
I take it you prefer tenors

She glances up at the mirror In it is the reflection of SENOR
AUGUSTO DE LARENA a big amiable Castilian in his fifties whos
changing a white dinner jacket thats had wine split on it He
breaks into a heavily accented version of Now or Never and
disappears from the dressing room mirror

NYAH
Would you mind if Im on top

ETHAN
Oh either way works for me

With a jaundiced look she rolls over on top of Ethan and begins
working on one of the safe compartments using a tiny torque
wrench from a tube of lipstick and a carbide pick from a mascara
brush She glances down and is rather disconcerted Continues
working with the pick and wrench

ETHANS VOICE
Youre never gonna find it there

NYAH
(she jumps dropping the torque wrench)
Damn it Find what

ETHAN
His ex-wifes Bulgari necklace that goes
up for auction Tuesday
Looking down to Ethan a touch of indignation

LOOKING UP

more or less hands locked behind his neck as he rests against
the raked back of the tub his eyes and nose inches from Nyahs
lower pelvic region as she straddles him Not exactly in the
mood
to move

She stiffens - he knows too damn much

NYAH
- rightwhere is it

ETHAN
Far right

She immediately switches her efforts from top left to the
bottom right compartment Shes utterly nonplussed

NYAH
Wheres the bloody -

ETHAN
(plucking it off his chest
offering it up like a mechanic
under the chassis)
- torque wrench

NYAH
- this is very disconerting

ETHAN
Hey you put me here I just do what Im
told

NYAH
- right

She unstraddles him and with a few deft moves with the torque
wrench and carbide pick - and its open She withdraws a velvet
pouch and opens the pouch Out spills the spectacular necklace

NYAH (contd)
Lovely
(starting to close the safe)
Who are you and whats it going to cost me

ETHAN
(having sat up)
I wouldnt do that

NYAH
Do what

The alarm goes off
ETHAN
That

The bathroom is suddenly filled with security guards gun drawn
Senor de lArena looking highly upset pops in

SENOR DE LARENA
Oh Senor Keyes thank God it is you
(in Spanish to security guards
annoyed)
Its Senor Keyes the security engineer

ETHAN
Well Senor de 1lArena the goods news is
that the heat sensors were activated But

Miss Nordoff-Hall my associate -
Senor de lArena kisses Nyahs hand

SENOR DE LARENA
Mucho gusto senorita

ETHAN
- did feel that she had rather too long to
work on the safe before they triggered the
alarm isnt that right Miss Hall

NYAH

Oh yes Absolutely Much too long I
should yes

Nyahs initial shock and panic slowly gives way to a wary
intensified curiosity - about Ethan

ETHAN
Under the circumstances I think we would
recommend re-setting the senors to
respond to a lighter load How do you
feel about forty kilos Miss Hall

NYAH
Indeed

ETHAN
Well Senor de lArena theres no reason
to disrupt your party any longer we have
some further concerns about the disposition
of your security guards which youll
receive in our written report by fax in the
morning hard copy to follow Shall we
He offers Nyah his arm They start out Ethan immediately
stops

ETHAN (contd)
Miss Hall Havent you forgotten
something

Nyah looking genuinely puzzled

NYAH
The necklace

Nyah slowly reaches into her dress and withdraws the glittering
string of diamonds and rubies from her bust

SENOR DE LARENA
(a great kidder)
What are you trying to do senorita Rob
me

They all laugh and Ethans got her out the door
EXT - ANDALUSIAN VILLA (LATE NIGHT - PRE DAWN)

The stars dimming the sky a gun metal blue Ethan and Nyah
emerge from the villa walking slowly Nyahs clearly
preoccupied

NYAH
Im missing something here aside from a
500000 pound necklace Even after I
botched the job I couldve walked out of
there with the bloody thing

ETHAN
At least you walked

NYAH
If you werent going to let me get away
with it why did you let me go thru with
it

ETHAN
Wanted to see how good you were
Im hoping we might work together

NYAH
May I say something no offence You
look like a gigolo you sound like a
thief you act like a cop - what the
bloody hell do you have in mind
ETHAN
Working under adverse conditions Highly
adverse conditions

NYAH
Sounds smashing Im in Muchacho mi
carro por favor Now be serious You
couldnt possibly want me off tonights
performance

ETHAN
You didnt do that badly

Her car arrives

NYAH
(as she moves to her car)
Youre apologizing for me Quite the
gentleman

ETHAN
(opening the car door)
Not really I triggered the alarm

One foot on the floorboard she freezes back to Ethan

ETHAN
Hey the Bulgari job last week was
flawless And Ive always been partial to
pale yellows

She slides behind the wheel

NYAH
(as he leads on the car)
I dont do laundry or put up with
cheeky bastards who set me up on their
territory so they can poach on mine

She takes off spewing bits of gravel and dust in her wake
Ethan smiles and shakes his head

ON THE ROAD - NYAH (MOVING)

around curves hair flying shes free Her car phone rings
Perplexed she lets it ring once or twice picks it up

NYAH
(tentatively)
Hola

ETHAN
Hi Would you mind slowing down

NYAH
Where did you get this number I dont
even have it

ETHAN VOICE
Would you like it

She hits the End button and disconnects The phone immediately

rings again She refuses to pick up Ethan pulls alongside
hers

She looks at him They speak through the open cars

ETHAN
Pull over and listen to me will you
Just listen

NYAH
Listen to what

ETHAN
I need your help and I thin you can use
mine

NYAH
Your help What are you talking about

ETHAN
Scotland Yard Interpol every Dutch
authority I can make them go away

NYAH
Oh bloody hell Youre a spy

She floors it and shoots ahead of Ethan nicking his car as she
takes off

ETHAN
(to himself)
I deserved that

SERIES OF DRIVING SHOTS - NYAH AND ETHAN

Ethan rings her again And keeps ringing Her face becomes
grim her flight progressively more desperate and with Ethans
pursuit progressively more determined They are reaching the
limits of adhesion around blind curves

MORE SHOTS DRIVING (DAWN)

The skys battleship gray Ethan pursues Nyah around hairpin
turns high above the Costa del Sol they rip thru patches of
marine fog drifting on the road obscuring it

Both are appalled by the others willingness to escalate risk in

this game of flight and pursuit until Ethan tears thru a fogbank

and sees on his GPS what Nyah cant see thru the fog -

less than four hundred meters ahead is a turn she cant possibly

negotiate and if she cant shell plunge off the road hundreds of
feet to rock and sea below Ringing her number again

ETHAN
(half to himself)
Slow down slow down

She turns up a mound and loses control She spins out and heads
toward the edge of the cliff

NYAH
(realizing shes in trouble)
Uh-oh

Ethan cuts her off and sends them both into a 540 degree spin
Her car stops just at the cliffs edge

Furious she wrenches open the car door and gets out

ETHAN
No

Suddenly theres no Nyah Ethan leaps over to Nyahs car and
sees Nyah dangling over the ocean and rocks hundreds of feet
below holding the door handle

NYAH
Ohoh

Taking a firm grip on her wrist

ETHAN
Dont look down Justlook at me
Thats itthats it

He pulls Nyah up to the car across the seat and half into
his arms For a long moment it looks like shes in shock Then

NYAH
Whats you name

ETHAN
Ethan Hunt

NYAH
Well Ethan Hunt what is it you want to
talk to me about

Thru the veil of morning fog Nyah looks at Ethan Her dark eyes
suggest wit and willingness and longing

ETHAN
Â»-more than I thought

They scarcely to move to bring their lips together

NYAH
Awfully short notice

ETHAN
Care to wait a decent interval

NYAH
Who wants to be decent

DISSOLVE
CLOSE - ETHAN (INT-EXT SAFEHOUSE - SEVILLE - DAY-EVE)

sleeping His eyes open slowly He comes to full consciousness
his head still on the pillow Something approaching serious
anxiety informs his features He lifts his head and looks at his
left angle widening Nyah lies on her side facing him

sleeping serenely Anxiety on the order of oh-God-this-isnt-
approved-recruiting-technique confirmed He lets his head flop
back on the pillow Then he turns so he and Nyah are profile to-
profile As he looks at her sleeping his anxiety fades replaced
by curiosity and even wonder He lifts his hand and just

brushes her cheek Her eyes open She knows where she is

ETHAN
So whatve you got against spooks

Nyah smiles
NYAH
When theyve got your recruiting

technique Not a thing

ETHAN
Oh Wellthis isnt exactly by the book

NYAH
Theyve got a book for this

ETHAN
Theyve got a book for everything

NYAH
The only other spook I knew was a liar
Charming but absolutely incapable of
telling the truth Hed lie about his
favorite color But then I reckon its an
occupational hazard All spies really do
is conceal the truth and tell lies

ETHAN
Not revealing information doesnt
necessarily make someone a liar

NYAH
Thats not the point In the end what
spies rely on is the one thing they think
they know that you dont

ETHAN
Which is

NYAH
That theyre lying

Ethan laughs

NYAH (contd)
-once they know that they can
get very verycrosee

Nyah shoulder and moves into Ethan

Nyah stops

ETHAN
So where did I got right

NYAH
Youre not a liar Or youre an awfully
good one
(then)
this thing these blokes pinched

ETHAN
I dont know that they pinched it
Dont even know that theyre blokes

to think about this

NYAH
Well then what I am I doing here I assume
Im meant to be some sort of thief-to
catch-a-thief
ETHAN
So do I Sort of

Nyah looks at Ethan a little worried

NYAH
Spoken like a spookyou ever afraid

ETHAN
Of what

Nyah laughs

NYAH
Ask a question you get an answer

ETHAN
Damn youre beautiful

NYAH
Thats because Im on my back

Quick as a cat Ethan flips Nyah over so shes looking down
at him

ETHAN
I dont think so

She sinks into his arms
EXT-INT - STREET - SEVILLE (VALENCIA FESTIVAL) (EVE)

Ethans step is unusually jaunty as he bounces along making his
way thru the festive and jostling crowds preparing for the Crema
portion of the Fallas de Valencia On this night great papier
mache effigies some serious some comic are placed all thru the
city and torched in great bonfires Outside the bar Ethans
looking for theres a street vendor hawking Fallas mementos and
flowers He starts past the vendor and it hits him - hes going
to buy some flowers

He chooses a colorful spring bouquet so fresh the dew can be
seen on the petals Ethan pays the vendor starts into the bar
and thinks better of walking into Swanbeck with the bouquet
Turns back to the vendor

ETHAN
Are you gonna be here a while

VENDOR
Si senor
ETHAN
Ill pickem up on my way out okay

Ethan enter the bar and goes upstairs to the second floor where
he passes security at a pair of double doors

INT - IMF BRIEFING ROOM

Swanbeck stands looking out the window Noisy crowds from the
festival provides a constant walla and during the sequence the
first effigies are lit and smoke and flame provide a vivid
background thru briefing rooms window

SWANBECK
Fetivals a pain in the ass Honoring
saint by settingem on fire
(turning to Ethan)
Sit down sit down

Ethan sits

SWANBECK (contd)
Lets you know what they think of saints
doesnt it Damn near set me on fire on
my way over here As if I havent been
burned enough today

A moment where its impossible to tell which way the wind is
going to blow between these two Then civilly

SWANBECK (contd)
Sorry I barged in on your vacation

ETHAN
Sorry I didnt let you know where I was

SWANBECK
Dont be Wouldnt be on vacation if you did

ETHAN
Well Youre sorry and Im sorry

SWANBECK
Why did you phrase it like that

ETHAN
Like what

SWANBECK
Youre sorry and Im sorry

ETHAN
You gotta be kidding

Swanbeck turns to his computer and begins play on a DVD and
projected onto a computer screen staring back at Ethan is

VLADIMIR NEKHORVICH

NEKHORVICH
(with exaggerate brio)
Well Dmitri How are you

Nekhorvich pauses as if waiting for reply Ethan smiles

ETHAN
Im fineand you

NEKHORVICH
Im fine

Ethan laughs

ETHAN
Im fine and youre fine

With Ethan simultaneously whispering

NEKHORVICH
Im fine too Im fine and youre fine - do
you remember dear fried how you got
Sergei and I to repeat those lines from Dr
Strangelove and we gave you the name of that
silly Soviet Premier because we didnt know
your nameIn those days you not only
saved our lives you saved our sanity Now
then Dmitri - we have this little problem
Every search for a hero must begin with
something that every hero requires a
villain Therefore in a search for our
hero Bellerophon we created a monster
Chimera I beg you Dmitri come to Sydney
and accompany me to Atlanta immediately
However we travel I must arrive at me
destination within 20 hours of departure
Forgive this fanciful explanation but for
now prudence dictates that I communicate
nothing but the gravest urgency
I fear I can entrust this to no one but
you Dmitri as we say â€˜Im sorry and
youre sorry

Swanbeck stops the DVD
SWANBECK
Let me ask you something You have any
idea what the hell hes talking about

Ethan smiles

ETHAN
An idea yeah

SWANBECK
Like

ETHAN

Like its a good idea to pick him up ina
hurry And a bad idea to fly him ona
commercial carrier So lets get on with
it Hes still in Sydney

SWANBECK
Dr Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead So is his
colleague Gradski but that happened
earlier We had Nekhorvich on a flight
from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies

Ethan sits back heavily

SWANBECK (contd)
- Hunt are you listening

Slowly looking up

ETHAN
If he didnt want to go anywhere without
me how did you get him on the flight

SWANBECK
You were there

Swanbeck clears his throat He turns back to the computer and
punches in MISSION DOUBLE IMAGE File open to computer scans
of AMBROSE SEAN and HUNT ETHAN the computer scanning and
comparing their features millimeter by millimeter stat by stat
as the computer then imposes with the help of the physiognomy
scan Ethans face on Ambrose hence mission double image

ETHAN

slowly looks up at Swanbeck

SWANBECK
When I couldnt find you I had to replace
you Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice
He double you what Two three times

ETHAN
Twice

SWANBECK
What did you think of him

ETHAN
You know we had reservations about each
other Isnt it a little late in the day
to be asking me that

SWANBECK
Not necessarily

Swanbeck shows Ethan a photo of airline Captain

SWANBECK
Airline record list Captain Harold
Macintosh as the pilot for Flt 2207 as
far as the media and all governmental
agencies are concerned Captain Macintosh
died on the flight but in fact he missed
it He did however make the next flight -
in cargo stuffed into a rather small
suitcase considering his size

Another photo of an open suitcase the body in it partially
obscured by a ring of police and customs officers

SWANBECK (contd)
Someone on that flight planned an
operation designed to down the plane and
make it look like an accident Someone
skillful enough to bring the whole thing
off without a hitch but - they dont
always get your luggage on the plane even
when you fly first class

ETHAN
So theres one thing we know Ambrose
doesnt

SWANBECK

Then you do think it was Ambrose
Ethan barely nods

SWANBECK (contd)
And youre not surprised
Ethan gives Swanbeck a look

ETHAN
Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean
wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact
that he took it

SWANBECK
Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred
innocent passengers

Ethan smiles

ETHAN
Sean feels he hasnt done the job unless
he leaves a lot of hats on the ground

SWANBECK
The question is why What was this
Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying

Ethan rises and moves to the window

ETHAN
Right now only Ambrose knows that

SWANBECK
In any case youve got to recover Chimera
and bring it to us

ETHAN
In order to do that Ive got to figure
out how he plans to make money with it

SWANBECK
- right In fact since the plane went
down our banking sources have confirmed a
marked increase in the stock pilling of
cash in terrorists accounts

ETHAN
Terrorists

SWANBECK
Well you know Nekhorvichs history
Youre the one who got him out of the
Soviet Union was it still in bio-
weapon business

ETHAN
If thats what youre thinking Ambrose
would have set up a bidding situation with
any number of buyers before he got on the
plane Locating him in time to stop
something like that -

SWANBECK
- is where Miss Hall comes in

ETHAN
(blindsided)
Excuse me
SWANBECK

Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship
which he took very seriously She walked
away and hes wanting her back ever
since We believe shes our surest and
quickest way of location him

ETHAN
(acidly)
And then what

SWANBECK
Then makes sure she continues to see him
Gets him confide in her and report to
you

ETHAN
You made it sound as if I was recruiting
her for her skills as a thief

SWANBECK
Well then I mislead you Or you made the
wrong assumption Either way were asking

her to resume a prior relationship not do
anything she hasnt already done

ETHAN
Shes got no training for this kind of
thing

SWANBECK

Go to bed with a man and lie to him
Shes a woman Shes got all the training
she needs

Ethans anger flashes but does his best to contain it

ETHAN
I dont think I can get her to do it

SWANBECK
on

eye

You mean itll be difficult

ETHAN
Very

SWANBECK
Well its not mission difficult Hunt
Its mission impossible Difficult should
be a walk in the park for you If you can
think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose
youre welcome to try Oh by the way you
might want to take a look at theseif you
have any further qualms about getting her
to do the job

He pulls out a little Minolta digital camera (identical to the
one in Nekhorvichs bag at airport security) Swanbeck sets it

A grim Ethan starring fixedly ahead of him emerges to an ever
more lively crowd as he does

Yes Theyre very nice

And hes lost in the crowd leaving a very puzzled vendor holding

NYAH
Theres nearly 2 million in London

ETHAN

A long shocked moment Nyah laughs

NYAH
Right

INT - SAFEHOUSE (EVE - LATER)

The pounding beat of the flamenco music seems to fill the room
Nyahs back to Ethan

NYAH
(grimly amused)
Not that it matter much butI seem to
recall you staying something like I was
hoping we could work together

ETHAN
This wasnt what I had in mind Nyah

NYAH
But it is what youd like me to do
so tell me to do it

She approaches Ethan Theyre inches apart
NYAH (contd)

Come on out with it Tell me to go and
insinuate myself back into Seans life
ETHAN
Go and insinuate yourself back into Seans
life

NYAH
Id like a little more conviction

ETHAN
So would I But its not mine to give

NYAH
(archness there)
Youve either got it or you dont Let
your conscience be your guide

ETHAN
Something like that

With a smile and a wink

NYAH
But I dont have a conscience Ima
bloody thief

ETHAN

You can be a thief and have a conscience

NYAH

No You can be a thief and have a
conscience Not me Why did you have to
tell me about this

(pouring herself a drink)
What do I have to do to get away from this
guy When youre with him he messes
about with your head every waking
momenteven now Ill be at some out-of-
the-way-place a tin of caviar and a
bottle of Crystal shows up at the table
with two glass God knows how he finds
out at any given moment where I am in the
world but he does And it looks like hes
done it again You know his definition of
a true paranoid

ETHAN
I dont

NYAH
Someone in possession of all the facts
(she turns away pauses)
Are you telling me I have to do this
ETHAN
Generally I dont favor coercing someone
Not when theres a chance my life could
end up in their hands

NYAH
And thats the only reason

ETHAN
Can you think of a better one

NYAH
Not me I was just hoping you mightor
thatsomehow in the course of business
this got personal as well as physical

ETHAN
Look would it make you feel better if I
didnt want you to do this

NYAH
Much

ETHAN
Then feel better

Long moment while she looks at him

ETHAN (contd)
Well That made all the difference in the
world didnt it

Ethan walks out onto the balcony She looks at his back

NYAH
Sean will never be anything but suspicious
if he picks up some sort of yoo-hoo-Im-
not-nad message Not after the way we
broke up

ETHAN
What wouldnt make him suspicious

NYAH
Probably that I needed him in some urgent
waydestitute - in serious troublethe

kind I couldnt possible sort out myself

ETHAN
Serious trouble Nyah is something I can
always arrange

Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA
molecules In the myth Bellerophon killed
Chimera a recombinant monster with the head
of a lion and the tail of a serpent who
plagued the ancient world I think Nekhorvich
has created a monster virus in Chimera and
apparently the means to kill it in
Bellerophon

do you trust her

As he speaks Ambrose pulls a cigar case and a cutter out of his
robe Takes a cigar out of the case and clips the end of the
cigar the razor-sharp cutter decapitates the tip of the cigar
like a guillotine

AMBROSE
One considers her timing of course -
getting nicked within a week of the plane
going down Suggestive even borderline
suspicious but hardly conclusive

STAMP

Well youve thorough about it at any
rate

tobacco trapped by the cut

AMBROSE
Youre not scrutinizing any casual shrug
for some hair-splitting nuance are you

STAMP
Sean please

Sean pulls Stamps hand closer

AMBROSE
Suppose she is some sort of Trojan horse
sent in by IMF to spy in us why should I
deny myself the pleasure of a ride or two
Or dont you think I can learn more from
her than she can from me

Ambrose twists Stamps wrist so that Stamp drops to one knee
trying to alleviate the pain

STAMP
(in pain)
I do

Ambrose leans in close to Stamps face as he places the cutter
around Stamps pinkie

AMBROSE
Now Hugh you must realize that some of us
have the burden of sex to deal withand
my dear chap I may or may not know why
she thinks shes here but Im willing to
take the risk because Hugh I am gaging
for it

Ambrose closes the cutter on Stamps finger and cuts the nail
just nicking the top of the finger and drawing blood Stamp
cries out Ambrose tosses Stamp a napkin light his cigar and
exhale

reaches the bookie who warns her to get down her bet She gives
him her money and gets the tickets just as the buzzer goes off -
no more bets Flustered by it she picks up her tickets but drops
the envelope She quickly kneels and scrambles to recover it
tucking it away and looking up - to see Stamp standing over her

McCloy stares at Nekhorvich for a long moment

MCCLOY
How could I possibly be infected

Nekhorvich shrugs

NEKHORVICH
Thats exactly what Gradski said - 27
hours before he died With Chimera the
most minute exposure can be fatal

McCloy again looks at his vital sign on the monitor He grips
the edge of the hospital bed

NEKHORVICH
But then you shouldnt be feeling to ill
not for another three of four hours
anyway

You took it All of it And what if I need
it
NEKHORVICH

If My my mythe five hundred
people on Bruny Island that you
deliberately infected with Chimera needed
it as well

MCCLOY
Oh please How was I to know they had to
be treated with Bellerophon within twenty
hours
NEKHORVICH
By asking me

MCCLOY
You still dont get it do you You want
to make an omelet you break a few eggs -
I needed to know just how bad the disease
was - in the real world not the lab And
you never know til you try You thought
you were genetically splicing together
strains of influenza to create a
cure for all influenzas But I saw you
creating a disease so terrible in Chimera
that the cure would be priceless

NEKHORVICH
You wanted the disease in order to peddle
the cure

MCCLOY

Well the thought had occurred to me I needed
Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon For
hero to be appreciated you need a monster

Now thats not so difficult to understand is
it Look time was a shot of penicillin could
knock off every bloody bug in the zoo Not
anymorehave you any idea the RandD money it
takes to float one little pissy boutique
antibiotic thats barely effective against one
strain of one bacterium If I couldnt makes

Okay here you go -

with the BIOCYTE PHARMACEUTICALS ELEVATORS AND RENDERINGS is
being rapidly morphed to three dimension existence off the
rendering specifications by Luther as if the building itself
were being constructed at a madly rapid pace from its foundation
to its reinforced steel structure to its honeycombing of floors

static but moving around and above it even as he proceeds

All storage and production of Chimera is
done here in this lab on the forty-second
floor the heart of the building

bio-containment suits etc -- populate the lab passing through
security door and air locks monitoring the virus stock pading
the injection gun etc

production vials in an incubation room and
housed in a small airtight chamber - inside
three injection guns

one pale yellow one sunset red Behind them are monitors
marked
respectively WORKING SEED STOCK MASTER SEED STOCK IN VITRO
VIRUS Behind these is a monitor screen with a blow-up of the
contents of the vials and the magnitude of the blow-up - 950000x

These are X-Ray microscope blow-ups ie allowing the viewer to
see the motility of the virus and its metabolism not dissimilar
to an MRI this of Chimera in its three different cultures

Ethans on the computer controls racing thru to WORKING SEED

temperature to a hundred The effect on the greenish hue in
the bottle is subtle but immediate - not so subtle is the
effect on the virus seeds viewed microscopically - they
immediately appear agitated their microscopic DNA innards
contracting and expanding

injection gun begins falling to the lab floor below one of
Ambroses team runs to grab it but before he can reach it he is
shot by Ethan whos falling to the floor below

AMBROSE
(to Ulrich)
Get it

As Ethan hits and dives for cover Ulrich goes for the gun
Ethan shoots Ulrich in the leg Ulrich hops back in pain

AMBROSE
Those were two explosions your van and
your safehouse in case you didnt hear
them both -- I believe that means youve
also lost a friend

Ethans crouching on the ground protected behind a series of
vertical metal sheets

ETHAN
And you couldnt walk to tell me about it

Ethan moves to pick up the injection gun which lies in the
shattered glass on the floor Ambrose Wallis and a couple of
other Ambrose team members fire kicking up broken glass Ethan
backs off

AMBROSE
(yelling)
Hold your fire dammit

The two spot one another in a mirror on the far wall of the hot

AMBROSE (contd)
Well Hunt Howve you been

ETHAN
(smiling)
Fight a bit of a cold

AMBROSE
And youre happy about that

ETHAN
Beats fighting the flu Im here to tell
you

AMBROSE

You know that was the hardest part of
having to portray you Grinning like an
idiot every fifteen minutes

ETHAN
I wouldve thought the hardest part was
exercising restraint Curbing that
pressing need of your to get your gun
off You were in such a hurry to knock
off that 747 you never figured out where
the virus really was

AMBROSE
I knew where it was

ETHAN
Oh then you knew the only way
in

could smuggle the live virus to the CDC
scientists in Atlanta was by injecting
himself and using his own bloodstream as a
Petri dish doing it inside of twenty
hours so he could take the anti-virus and
still have it be effective You knew that
while you were knocking him off and
destroying the very thing you came for

Ethan has been using this exchange to ease a fresh seventeen

round clip

into his weapon and he punctuates this last witha

spray of gunfire attempting to cover his own effort to the reach
the injection gun The return fire nearly hits the injection
gun kicking up glass and dust and making it move around on the

floor

AMBROSE
Stop Put a sock in it Hit that bloody
gun and youll spray the bloody virus all
over the place

Everybodys regained cover but the injection gun remains out of
everybodys reach

Nyah walks

ETHAN
There it is guys the last of it

AMBROSE

Yep Youve provided us with a golden
opportunity to have both the bug and the
bug killer

ETHAN
What was the top bid

AMBROSE
Why you going to make me a better offer

ETHAN

really

Enraged but trying to control it

This isnt exactly working out the way you
thought it would Ethan Sorry

Finger on the injection trigger she rises and turns the barrel
on her arm firing The sound of the air pressure pushing the
virus into her is unmistakable as is the circle of tiny puncture
wounds on her skin Nyah moves in front of Ethan covering him
as she turns to face Ambrose

ETHAN

shocked by Nyahs gesture but as she addresses Ambrose he
resets the Countdown on his chronometer to twenty hours As
it drops into the nineteen

AMBROSE

You bitch

Shes been laughing away with Ethan

NYAH
Youre not going to shoot Sean Not
this bitch Shes worth thirty-seven
million pounds

I wasnt thinking Justtrying to keep
you from getting hurt thats all

This hits Ethan with the force of a blow

ETHAN
- you who dont have a conscience

NYAH
(something of surprise to
her)
I guess I liedYou cant get both of us
out of here can you

ETHAN
No

NYAH
Then youll have to kill me before its
too late Before I start killing people

ETHAN
No

NYAH
Im infected with Chimera You know you
dont have a choice Just do it now

She puts Ethans gun to her forehead

Ethan runs from the cover of the tanks toward the exploded wall
once in the open he exchanges direct gunfire with Ambroses
team wounding a couple men He reaches the wall and dives thru
camera with him as he drops 25 stories the sound of gunfire in
the air all around him

Less than a hundred feet from the ground a small dark chute
deploys and Ethan is lost from view beneath it

Swanbeck breaks off and turns to a somewhat battered and battle
weary Ethan

SWANBECK (contd)
- since it appears that Chimera the
mother of all nightmares is on the loose

somewhere around here - is there any way
this disaster can be viewed as a qualified
one

ETHAN

(tight-lipped)
Not yet We did manage to pull any
sensitive equipment and material out of
our safehouse wreckage

SWANBECK
We could lock down passport control and
all ports of authority but that wont
stop Ambrose and beyond him we dont
know who else were looking for -- all
terrorist bank accounts of which were
aware are stable No deposits no
withdrawals Therefore no suspects

ETHAN
We think weve got our finger on the
buyer

SWANBECK
Do you Even assuming youre able to
prevent Ambrose selling Chimera youve
now got an additional problem You
destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte If
Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now
hell have to do it by taking a pint or so
of Miss Halls blood to market

ETHAN
Yes I believe thats right

SWANBECK
But that leaves another seven or eight
pints of Chimera

ETHAN
You mean that leaves Miss Hall

SWANBECK
Yes I believe thats right Now my
understanding is that 20 hours after
exposure the victim becomes infectious
Highly infectious

Ethan glances at his chronometer Swanbeck sees it

Ethan nods

SWANBECK (CONTD)
You noted the time of exposure

SWANBECK (CONTD)

- good Then if you manage to get hold of
Ambrose and obtain what hes got youve
got -

(glancing at the chronometer)
- 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three
seconds to destroy the largest remaining
source of Chimera on earth

ETHAN
She sacrificed herself

SWANBECK
Brave girl If you can get hold of
Bellerophon with the time limit you may
spare her the ultimate sacrifice But in
either case youve got less than nine

hours to kill her or cure her After that
its out of our hands and a matter of
worldwide material law And Hunt However
you obtain it we want you to preserve a
sample of Chimera Bring it back alive

Ethans staring at Swanbeck

SWANBECK (CONTD)
Something else

ETHAN
Arent you even curious About why she
did it

SWANBECK
No I cant afford to be curious And

neither can you Hunt

As the eerie wail of the didgeridoo seems to mount in volume and
intensity the overcast sky filtering into the loft seems
particularly oppressive Ethans up against it and he knows it

Ethan reaches Nyah at the copter Inches apart they can only
stare silently at one another

INT - CULTURAL MUSEUM

Didgeridoo music A child admires a painting Swanbeck and
Ethan

face one another A long long pause For a moment it appears
as

if Swanbeck has lost awareness of Ethans presence

SWANBECK
Sorry Ethan I dont quite know where to
begin Any suggestions

ETHAN
Youd like me to conduct my own
debriefing

SWANBECK

Why not Youve done just about
everything else on this operation

ETHAN
Id thank you -- but Im not sure that was
a compliment

SWANBECK
Of course it was Anyone whose operations
requires the level of disinformation that
yours do is bound to get a little flak
here and there You try flogging the
stories on CNN Ive had to come up with
about whats been going on around here the
last few days At any rate its been

most instructive -- what theyll swallow
or what theyll broadcast with a straight
face

(picking up a file)
Miss Halls blood it appears has
absolutely no elements of the Chimera
virus Not even antibodies

ETHAN
Yes I gathered as much

SWANBECK
And the only other remaining sample was in
the canister you recover from Ambrose

ETHAN
Yes

SWANBECK
And that appears to have been destroyed
It also contained the anti-virus
Bellerophon

ETHAN
Well Bellerophon it turns out was only
really effective against Chimera

SWANBECK
But you were under specific instructions
to bring back a living sample of the
Chimera virus Id be very interested to
know how after youd managed its recovery
intact it subsequently got destroyed

ETHAN
By fire Thats the best way really

SWANBECK
So you didnt fail mission you simply
changed it

Ethan doesnt respond

SWANBECK (contd)
Its no longer enough for you to execute
and implement IMF policy you now wish to
go in the business of creating it

ETHAN
No I dont But in this case -

SWANBECK
In this case it wasnt a bad idea In
face it was a pretty damn good idea
Just dont make a habit of it And as for
Ms Hall in light of her efforts her
criminal records will certainly be
expunged Im assuming you approve

ETHAN
I do

SWANBECK
Where is she now by the way Do you
know

ETHAN

I dont No exactly

SWANBECK
Well Hunt what are your plans

ETHAN
Not sure Some sort of vacation Ill
let you know where Im going

SWANBECK
Oh you dont have to do that Wouldnt
be a vacation if you did

Ethan and Swanbeck exchange one final knowing glance

SKY NEWSCASTER
This incident in the wake of rumors
suddenly surfacing about Mr McCloy and
Biocytes financial difficulties --
including criminal allegations of insider
trading embezzlement conspiracy to
commit fraud and stock parking -- have
understandably sent stock prices of the
pharmaceutical company plummeting

EXT - SYDNEY (DAY)

Ethan emerges to a very crowded street Billy and Luther are
waiting Both look to Ethan
LUTHER
(worried)
So what did he say

ETHAN
Good job And thanks

BILLY
(incredulous)
Thats it Thats it Thats it

LUTHER
(dryly looking at Billy)
And the checks in the mall

BILLY
Right Just remember mates Billy
Bairds the name Anything you need to
get move or watch Im your man

And Billys gone Ethan and Luther remain alone both reluctant
to say anything both reluctant to leave

One quick bear hug then
LUTHER

Always nice hearing from you man Stay in
touch

And Luthers off Ethan looks after him a bit wistfully Then
curiously tentative he moves off into the crowd After a half-
dozen steps something catches his eyes He stops

One quick bear hug then

NYAH
(a tad wary)
Do you know me

NYAH
is inches from him Without batting an eye
ETHAN
No Should I

NYAH
No You just looked as if you did

ETHAN
No

She wraps her arms around him and kisses him with considerable
conviction

ETHAN (contd)
-just as if Id like to

NYAH
Oh Well

He kisses her with a conviction that is more than a match for
hers

NYAH (contd)
I think that can be arranged

Looks around at the swirling crowd

ETHAN
Lets get lost

And in a moment theyve vanished from the frame and into the
crowd Camera begins to pull back the bustling crowd ever
filling the frame - and in the distance perhaps just a splash
of a bouquet of flowers can be seen appearing to bounce along on
its own the rising beat of the MI theme
