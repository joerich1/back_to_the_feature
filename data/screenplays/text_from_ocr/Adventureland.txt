your signifier

if I just wanted to get it over with-

BRAD
Or a hooker In New York I hear the
Asian ones are the best value

JAMES
Right that was in Consumer Reports
Jesus I know most people have low
standards but I’m different

He sees Arlene across the room holding court with her
friends She’s clearly talking about him Humiliated he
skulks out of the room

4 EXT LONG ISLAND EXPRESSWAYSURROUNDING STREETS - DAY
A newish 80s-model sky blue Plymouth Reliant rolls down the
highway James’s bicycle strapped to the roof James is
slumped against the window sharing the back seat with some
duffel bags and crates of records

WE PASS BY

strip malls and chain stores a high school looking a
little worse for the wear suburban homes varying only
slightly from one another

THE CAR APPROACHES

a young man on a bicycle The back of his orange t-shirt
reads

ADVENTURELAND

As the car passes we see the biker a wiry goofy-looking 20-
year-old His name is TOMMY FRIGO

Frigo recognizes James He grins and gives him the finger

The EQ on the Neil Young song changes -- IT’S PLAYING ON

Cocktail hour in the Brennan household COUNT BASIE swings
on the stereo as James’s father (MR BRENNAN) is finishing
off a frozen daiquiri preparing another MRS BRENNAN sips
white wine while reading a paperback copy of “Iacocca An
Autobiography”

James enters clutching the legal pad looking determined

JAMES
Okay so I need to talk to you guys about-
ADVENTURELAND (revised 8507)

Silence

MRS BRENNAN
(putting down her book)
Now what do you want for dinner I can
make a roast burgers minute steaks

JAMES
Wow I uh-

MRS BRENNAN
(crossing to the fridge)
-or leftover lamb stew

JAMES
Any of that sounds-—

MRS BRENNAN
And I even got that frozen manicotti the
kind you like

MR BRENNAN
He loves that

JAMES
Sure Let’s have that Sothe trip is
going to cost a tiny bit more than we
discussed

MRS BRENNAN
What are we talking about

JAMES
Um my Europe trip So my original
estimate for the whole trip was 1568
dollars But I’ve researched more youth
hostels and the median cost is a bit
higher than I thought by seven dollars
and sixty-eight cents multiplied by
forty-two days is 32256 But the good
news is I still qualify for a student
eurail pass which saves us 14345 But
I also think my emergency fund is
unrealistic at 100 I should make it
150 So with the 768 dollars I have
from grandma’s trust fund plus the 800
you guys are already giving me I will
need another 229 dollars and eleven
cents It makes the total for you guys
1029 dollars and eleven cents

MRS BRENNAN
One-thousand and twenty-nine dollars

MR BRENNAN
And eleven cents

Jamess parents exchange a look
ADVENTURELAND (revised 8507)

MRS BRENNAN
James your father has been transferred
to a different department

JAMES
Really That’s great-

MRS BRENNAN
It’s not a better department We’1ll be
making less money Considerably less

JAMES
Whwhat happened

MR BRENNAN
It’s not a big deal they just they
reorganized a bit It’s temporary

MRS BRENNAN
We hope I’m sorry honey I know we
said we thought we could help with your
trip We can’t

JAMES
But it’s my graduation present

MRS BRENNAN
I know but we don’t have it We can’t
spare a penny for Europe And we can’t
spare a penny for grad school either

JAMES

rent

MRS BRENNAN
James we cancelled our week in Montauk

JAMES

JAMES
I really haven’t had many jobs per

Se

But here’s my academic record and my
extracurricular activities I wrote for
the literary journal ‘The Gordian Knot’
And in high school I got a 750 on the
math SATs so I’d be good at tabulating

checks-—

RESTAURANT MANAGER
These are the only jobs you’ve had

neighbors the Palmieri’s I have their

letter of recommendation-

RESTAURANT MANAGER

Frigo throws a punch at James’s groin James manages to
partially deflect the blow

Frigo Quit it

The two young men start swinging wildly at each other

FRIGO
Watch out the lawn mower

privates James falls to the lawn moaning

JAMES

pleasure Out where I grew up if I tell
someone that they’ll beat me to death
with a table leg

ERIC
You still thinking about graduate school

JAMES
Yeah
ADVENTURELAND (revised 8507)

ERIC
Total mistake What do you need another
degree for Did Henry Miller need a
degree Or Samuel Beckett

JAMES
Actually Beckett went to Trinity College
and after that he was an assistant for
James Joyce Which is a story I always
wanted to turn into a two-character play-

ERIC
Yeah shut up my point is -- you don’t
come from money Graduate school’s gonna
require massive loans Three more years
of school then what a decade or two of
paying them off Why not blow your
brains out now

JAMES
But if something’s worth doing

ERIC

Take some time to picture the narrative
of your life Needing it or wanting
money is the fundamental trap of
humankind

(putting a hand on James’s

shoulder)
Look I want you to know youll be with
me in spirit this summer Take this

From a coat pocket Eric produces a baggie that contains
several thin poorly-rolled joints

JAMES
But you knowI get a little crazy-

ERIC
Take it

James nervously jams the bag into his pocket

ERIC
You think you don’t like weed You will

JAMES
(worried won’t drop it)
But how am I going to break into
journalism if I don’t go to grad school

ERIC
Brennan you’ll be with me Ina few
short months we’1ll be in New York City
Well be living the adventure together

look at “Adventureland” -- it’s a ramshackle place a lot

closer to Coney Island than to Disney World

radio plays loudly all day long every day)

JOEL

so watch what you say
ADVENTURELAND (revised 8507) 13

EXT “LAUGHING CLOWN” BOOTH ADVENTURELAND - LATER 16

Joel and James are at the ubiquitous carnival game wherein
contestants squirt water into a plastic clown-head’s mouth
inflating a balloon until it pops

JOEL
The trick here you’ve got a better
chance of winning if you pick a clown
with a new balloon The old balloons
have already been stretched out Less
likely to pop You can share this info
with cute girls at your discretion

JAMES
I appreciate that

JOEL
No sweat new guy

Flying Dutchman” Even more inexplicable
is how they decided to spell it Morons

The sign reads “THE FLIGHING DUTCHMAN”

They enter the game which is a platform with for
large milk bottles Very large stuffed panda bea
dangling over them

JOEL

ty or so
rs are

One dollar buys five rings If the ring
lands on one of the red bottles they win

one of these giant-ass pandas

JAMES
That is a giant-ass panda

JOEL
It’s the best prize in the park And
that’s because this game is unwinnable

Observe I’11 drop the ring from three

inches away

Joel holds a plastic ring right above a bottle
The ring bounces off

JAMES
Nobody ever wins

JOEL
If they do it’s because you weren’t

He drops it

being vigilant and they reached over and
placed the ring on the bottle Someone

wins a giant-ass panda bear on your
watch Go home you’re fired

19 EXT “FREE THROW” BOOTH ADVENTURELAND - LATER
They stand at a booth with five basketball hoops

JOEL
If you stand directly below a hoop you

will see that it’s been hammered into an

oval shape But back here the sucker
can’t tell

ADVENTURELAND (revised 8507)

James passes a basketball through the narrow hoop

JAMES
It barely fits That’sso wrong
JOEL
A criminal abuse of the laws of
perspective
JAMES
Well people are getting ripped off-
JOEL
Yeah yeah Trotsky let’s get you a

booth

(he walks away James follows)
So your life must be utter shit or you
wouldn’t be here

JAMES
Yeah I want to be in Manhattan But to
make enough to cover rent and actually
save anything seems so hard

JOEL
Wait til your parents start charging you
rent My dad even makes me pay
utilities

It’s the hour when the park starts getting overrun with
teenagers and young adults Blaring from the many

James notices that the customer’s eyes are darting to
something behind him Just as James turns to look he sees a
DRUNK DAD (wearing a Scorpions concert tee) holding his six-
year-old child over the milk bottles The boy places a ring
on a red bottle and the man quickly pulls him back

DRUNK DAD
(slurring drunkenly)
He won Check it out Look my kid won

JAMES
(lowering his voice)
Sir I saw you holding him over the
bottles That’s cheating

DRUNK DAD

MOLLY HATCHET T-SHIRT
I saw the kid throw it

JAMES
C’mon guys give me a break-

MOLLY HATCHET T-SHIRT
(for passersby to hear)
This faggot’s trying to cheat a kid
Give the kid his prize

James glances over to a fellow employee in the adjoining
booth a pint-size funny-looking 15-year-old MUNCH (his
nickname short for “Munchkin”) He shrugs

JAMES
Guys fellas I could lose my job-

DRUNK DAD
(leaning close)
Give my kid the fuckin’ panda

The dad shows James a hunting knife he’s concealing by his

hip

Suddenly a young woman in a “GAMES” t-shirt EM LEWIN
enters from the other side She pulls down a panda and gives
it to the man
ADVENTURELAND (revised 8507)

broken ahead of the pack In the
backstretch it’s Orange and Green
Orange and Green And Orange takes it by
a nose Green places and Red shows
Please come to the window to collect your

JOEL
Well we are doing the work of pathetic
lazy morons

JAMES
I figured out that I’1l probably need
three to four hundred a month for my
share of the apartment If I can save up
twelve hundred dollars this summer
that’s three or four months of rent

JOEL

driftwood onto a fire

Em presses down the play button on an old-school cassette
playerrecorder Through the plastic door we see hand-
written on the cassette J’S FAVORITE BUMMER SONGS A stark
solo acoustic version of Neil Young’s “Cowgirl In The Sand”
starts to play

LATER Em and James are lying on a blanket staring at the
night sky Em suddenly stands and walks away James looks
up bemused He gets up follows her as she enters a nearby
wooded area She glances back then goes into a run

The Neil Young song slowly grows less tinny more intimate

James enters the dark tree area He glances around for Em
whos disappeared He looks a bit spooked

A SLASH OF LIGHT
crosses Em’s face as she emerges from the dark She pushes
James into a tree moving her lips to his They kiss and
grope hungry and breathless

JAMES
No she’s great But I’m not really
looking for a girlfriend I’m getting
over a broken heart
CONNELL
You didn’t tell her that did you
JAMES
Um why
CONNELL
(rolling his eyes)
Christ Girls don’t want to hear about
your broken heart
JAMES
Wh-why not
CONNELL
Because women don’t want a guy who’s all
confused and torn up over someone else
Look I’m not saying you should never be
vulnerable in front of a girl But you
don’t play that card first
JAMES
It’s a card Like acard

like that I bet you’re good at science

James is looking out the window

ON THE CORNER

a rusty old Dodge Dart has just pulled over And Joel is
getting out of it looking furtive not wanting to be
associated with his father and his battered car

JAMES
(to Mr Brennan)
Um Wait for me at the corner

James hops out of the car The Dart sputters away as Joel
starts walking

JAMES
(jogging across the street)
Hey Joel

Joel turns around He’s wearing his “games” shirt

JOEL
Oh Hey

JAMES

INT BACKYARD BRENNAN HOUSE - LATER EARLY EVENING 172
James stands in his backyard taking in the evening
A PIERCING WHISTLE
echoes from a field behind his house James sees a few
bottle rockets shoot into the sky He climbs over the fence
and heads toward the group of young men shooting the
fireworks Frigo runs toward James
FRIGO

Brennan We stole a case of Schlitz from

Zeblisky’s garage
EXT FIELD BEHIND BRENNAN HOUSE - ALMOST NIGHT 173

Frigo runs around with a roman candle pointing it like a
rifle as it shoots fireballs

AN EMPTY SCHLITZ CAN

is tossed into a pile of cans James sitting under a tree
opens another beer

He lies on the ground staring up He watches an errant
bottle rocket ricochet into the branches above his head

WE MOVE IN CLOSE ON his pensive face

JAMES’S MEMORY THERE IS NO SOUND

WE’RE WATCHING EM from James’s POV as she rides the
roller coaster at Adventureland She’s feigning boredom as
the ride swoops and dips recklessly behind her

MORE QUICK CUTS OF OTHER IMAGES OF EM

- At Danny’s Bar giving the camera a devilish look as she
throws back a shot of bourbon

- A moment at a game booth where Em turns away from an
irritating customer and shoots us a “save me from this
hell” look

- Looking at James sitting on the hood of her car at the
beach at night her eyes filled with sadness and fear

- Driving in her car at dusk singing along with the radio
- In her pool at night staring at us
JAMES ’S DAYDREAMING

is broken by Frigo who stands over him

FRIGO

Don’t fall asleep Brennan
JAMES

Why
FRIGO

Cause I‘ll jack off on your face
Frigo giggles like a lunatic

JAMES
What on earth is wrong with you

James stands up He’s come to a decision
JAMES

Look can you get your mom’s car again
Right now I’1l give you twenty bucks

FRIGO
Thirty

JAMES
Fine

FRIGO
Forty

James shakes his head He gets out his wallet removes two
twenties and hands them over

As Frigo goes to pocket the cash James slugs him in the
privates Frigo collapses onto the grass

JAMES

Even
EXT FRIGO’S HOUSE - NIGHT 174

Once again Frigo is behind the wheel of his mother’s Cutlass
as James pushes the car out of the driveway

EXT SUBURBAN STREETLEWIN HOUSE - LATER 175

The Cutlass rumbles down a street As they approach Em’s
house they see that there are a few cars in the driveway and
several more parked on the street

JAMES
Huh

Frigo stops the car

FRIGO
Ill wait for you

JAMES
No don’t

Beat Frigo looks sympathetically at James

FRIGO
Hope it works out

JAMES
(surprised and a little touched)
Thanks Frigo

James surprised and a little touched by Frigo gets out of
the car and crosses toward the front door He rings the
bell He turns back toward Frigo He’s not in the car --
instead he’s over on the side of Em’s lawn urinating on a
tree

FRIGO
I can’t hold it

James hears the door open and turns back Em stands there
Behind her we can hear an adult cocktail party in progress
Em stares at James tongue-tied

JAMES
Hey I wanted to talk to you My timing
sucks as usual

EM
Um Come in Hurry

She ushers him inside

INT

Em leads James past the living room where oblivious adults
are clustered talking loudly

INT

James enters the room

FOYERSTAIRS LEWIN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

EM’S BEDROOM LEWIN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

look at each other for an awkward beat

Beat

EM
This is pretty weird

JAMES

Yeah
(beat)

Look I’m here to apologize First of
all I’m sorry I hung up on you that day
Worse it’s my fault everyone found out
about you and Connell I told Lisa P
Andwhile you and I were seeing each
otherI went on a date with Lisa P
Nothing really happened We kissed a
little But II don’t knowI feel
bad about that

EM
I heard you guys went out

JAMES
You did You never said anything

EM
(looking down)
What could I say
(beat)
I’m sorry if I hurt you II don’t
know what’s wrong with me

JAMES
The only thing wrong is that you need to
find someone you can trust

She looks up at him for a long beat

EM
Are you nominating yourself

They hurry up the stairs

Em follows shutting the door

They

JAMES
As long as you don’t mind trusting a guy
who clearly doesn’t have a fucking clue
about anything

Em moves to James She pulls his shirt off He leans
forward and kisses her Without abandoning her lips he
slides off her t-shirt They kick off their shoes pull off
socks then help each other out of their pants Em takes off
her bra They both slide off their underwear

They stand facing each other naked Their eyes are nervous
and searching James caresses her cheek and smiles Em
laughs blinking away a few tears

We hold on them for a long moment

EXT MIDWAY ADVENTURELAND - DUSK 178
It’s right after sunup Nobody is here yet

IN SEPARATE SHOTS THE CAMERA PULLS BACK FROM THESE THINGS

The empty midway a rusty cotton candy vending cart the
snack bar menu sign that hasn’t changed for years and is
missing letters the dark and silent video arcade the “Bimbo
the Clown” machine with an “OUT OF ORDER” sign the
moronically grinning “Hats Off To Larry” mannequin racks of
stuffed “bananas with eyes” empty Chopper ride gondolas
creaking and swaying

WE END ON A SHOT THAT CRANES INTO THE AIR showing a wide
view of the shabby little park A desolate wind blows
through Adventureland Another summer’s almost over
