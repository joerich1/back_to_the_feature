TULLY

Written By Diablo Cody
INT MARLO AND DREW’S HOUSE (JONAH’S BEDROOM) - NIGHT
MUSIC “SPACE ODDITY” by the Langley Schools Music Project

MARLO MOREAU wears a maternity T-shirt and sweatpants She is
hugely pregnant She kneels on the floor of a BOY’S BEDROOM
in a small suburban home Her son JONAH 5 is standing next
to her He is shirtless but wears pajama pants

The song “Space Oddity” as performed by a children’s choir
plays on Jonah’s little CD player

Marlo holds a strange little PLASTIC BRUSH with nylon
bristles It’s not for Jonah’s hair Instead she runs the
brush in long smooth strokes down her son’s bare arm

MARLO
Hold still Jonah

She moves to the other side running the brush down the other
arm gently pressing the soft bristles into his skin

MARLO (CONTD)
There we go Let’s do feet now Sit
down

Jonah sits down He casually grabs his crotch and holds on

MARLO (CONTD)
Do you need to go to the bathroom

Jonah continues holding himself

JONAH
No

MARLO
Just being your own best friend
huh

Jonah nods blithely

MARLO (CONTD)
Okay

She resumes brushing gently running the bristles over the
soles of Jonah’s BARE FEET

INT MARLO AND DREW’S HOUSE (SARAH’S ROOM) - NIGHT

Marlo heads into another bedroom equally small but more

feminine SARAH 8 is sitting at a small desk looking
irritated with her homework
MARLO
Almost done here

SARAH

MARLO
Let me see
(reading)
“In Chapter Three of I Hate Rules
Katie Kazoo decides that there
should be no more rules at school
What are the consequences”

SARAH
I don’t know
MARLO
Things get out of hand don’t they
SARAH
Yeah
MARLO

How about George He ate ten
desserts and then what happened

Sarah plays with her hair distracted
MARLO (CONTD)
I’m not going to write this

for you Sares

Sarah puts her head down on the desk dramatically She BANGS
it twice

Marlo stares at her daughter wearily

Sarah bangs her head a THIRD TIME for good measure

INT MARLO AND DREW’S HOUSE (KITCHEN) - NIGHT

Marlo walks into the kitchen It’s small and there are a few
boxes of assorted ENERGY BARS propped open on the already-
cluttered counters Marlo Grabs two LUNCH BOXES off the
counter Then she reaches for her PHONE and plugs a set of
EARBUDS into it She picks a song

MUSIC UP “Blue” by the Jayhawks
As the music plays Marlo begins makes two LUNCHES for Jonah

and Sarah Finally an escape from the children even if
she’s still servicing them

She places two different sandwiches into plastic bento boxes
She pours Goldfish crackers from a Costco-sized container
into two of the compartments She cuts on the diagonal

Marlo’s husband DREW enters He’s a slightly nerdy software
engineer in a Doctor Who T-shirt Marlo pulls out her
earbuds Her private moment is over abruptly

Without missing a beat Drew begins filling Thermoses and
slicing the green tops off the strawberries Marlo and Drew
are a well-oiled machine Their childcare routines are
choreographed like ballet

DREW
Jonah’s finally down Jesus it’s
like trying to kill the head
vampire

MARLO
Did you bring Sarah her inhaler

DREW
Yeah Did you uh brush Jonah

MARLO
Roger wilco Hey don’t forget
we’re going to my brother’s for
dinner tomorrow night

DREW
Ugh Craig hates me

MARLO
Craig doesn’t hate you He just
hangs out with i-bankers all day
so his default setting is “ass”

DREW
You think he’‘ll respect me more now
that I got a promotion

MARLO
No
(then)
But I bet he can’t wait to show us
his new Tesla

They switch to stupid deep “bro” voices to imitate Craig

DREW
“Tt’s sick dude”
MARLO
“It’s soooo sick Look how I plug
it in”
They bond briefly over making fun of Craig
MARLO (CONTD)
“IT don’t just look cool I’m single-
handedly saving the planet”

DREW
“Youre welcome Earth”

Marlo chucks a mayonnaise-covered knife into the sink

EXT ST VITUS SCHOOL (LOWER LOT) - DAY

A wet spring morning in Rye New York Marlo’s dented Honda
Fit rolls into the parking lot of ST VITUS ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL

INT MARLO’S CAR - DAY

Marlo is behind the wheel Jonah and Sarah are strapped into
booster seats in the back of the car

JONAH
This is not our lot

MARLO
What

JONAH

Go to the other parking lot

MARLO
The other parking lot’s full
honey We have to park here today

SARAH
(groaning)
Not again

MARLO
Jonah I have to meet with Mrs
Bell in
(checking)
negative three minutes Please
let’s just park here

JONAH
Other lot Other lot
SARAH
Jonah don’t

Jonah begins KICKING THE SEAT and SCREAMING He can’t handle
any disruption to his routine He melts down

JONAH

No No Noooooo
SARAH
(distressed)

Mom Make him stop

JONAH
(screaming)
Other lot Other lot

SARAH
Jonah stop

Marlo attempts to respond calmly but she’s unraveling

MARLO
(to Sarah)
You know how he is with his
routine He doesn’t like when we do
things differently

SARAH
Nobody cares about what I like

Jonah is WAILING at this point

MARLO
Jonah the other lot is full
There’s nowhere to park
(desperate)
Jesus Christ Please

EXT ST VITUS SCHOOL (UPPER LOT) - DAY
A different crowded parking lot Jonah got his way One CAR
pulls out of a spot Marlo’s car is braked patiently waiting
for said spot Marlo’s car pulls into the spot
INT MARLO’S CAR - SAME
MARLO
(to Jonah)
All right you happy

Jonah nods tear-stained
INT SCHOOL (PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE) - DAY

Marlo enters the PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE flustered MRS BELL
aka LAURIE waits at her desk

MARLO
Hi Laurie I’m sorry I’m late
(lying)
Regent was backed-up for blocks

LAURIE
Hi Marlo Are you on maternity
leave yet You look like you’re
about to pop

MARLO
Yeah Friday was my last day

Marlo stands awkwardly in front of the desk forcing a big
fake expectant smile This is her “school persona”

MARLO (CONTD)
Such a blessing

LAURIE
I’1l try not to take up too much of
your time here so I’ll just get
right to it Ms Marvish tells me
that Jonah is still having a tough
time in class We’re concerned
about his social and emotional
development

MARLO
Kindergarten’s a tough transition

LAURIE
It’s April

MARLO
(sheepish)
Yeah

LAURIE
And there’s about to be a big
disruption in Jonah’s life too

MARLO
What

Laurie nods at Marlo’s huge belly duh

MARLO (CONTD)
Oh yeah
LAURIE
Jonah’s sweetheart We love him
But as you know he’s an “out-of-
the-box” kid He’s quirky

Marlo nods subtly lip-syncing the word “quirky” as Laurie

says it It’s a euphemism that comes up a lot regarding
Jonah

LAURIE (CONTD)

There are twenty-four other
children in the class and it’s not
fair to them when Jonah needs so
much of the teacher’s time

Marlo’s response is eager desperate

MARLO
We’re working on the meltdowns at
home And we’re doing these
exercises and all this stuff I
just made this chart--

LAURIE
(interrupting)
We think Jonah could benefit from a
one-to-one aide A teacher just for
him who shadows him during the day
and gives him the extra support he
requires

MARLO
Is the aide someone on staff here

LAURIE
No we don’t provide aides

MARLO
Oh so I have to go out and get
AIDS all by myself

She chuckles dryly at her own joke Laurie doesn’t catch on

LAURIE
Yes you’d need to hire this
person

MARLO

I’m paying to get AIDS

LAURIE
(confused)
One aide He just needs one
Marlo nods seriously giving up on the AIDS joke

MARLO
Right Okay

LAURIE
We don’t usually make these kinds
of accommodations for students at
Saint V’s but you guys are a
great family so

MARLO
Thank you Laurie I really really
appreciate it I want to make this
work

LAURIE
No problem Have a great day now

Marlo musters a smile and rises to exit shattered

INT COFFEE SHOP - DAY

With the kids dropped off and a temporary reprieve from work
Marlo enters the local COFFEE PLACE on the town’s main drag

She heads to the counter
MARLO
I’ll have a decaf skim latte
please
An OLDER FEMALE CUSTOMER behind Marlo pipes up
NOSY CUSTOMER
You know there’s trace amounts of

caffeine even in decaf right

MARLO
Huh

The women gestures to Marlo’s PREGNANT BELLY

MARLO (CONTD)
Oh yeah

NOSY CUSTOMER
Just so you know

BARISTA
You still want it
MARLO
Yeah yeah

NOSY CUSTOMER
Just don’t overdo it
(then know-it-all)
My daughter has three so I read up
on all this stuff

MARLO
This is my third as well

NOSY CUSTOMER
Are your children short-statured

MARLO
What

NOSY CUSTOMER
From the caffeine

The BARISTA is tapping out a total on the register

MARLO
Yes My kids are miniature And my
son actually came out with the
Starbucks logo burned into his ass
like a cattle brand

BARISTA
Would you like any sweetener with
that

MARLO

Yeah Give me the one that causes
cancer in rats

The barista shrugs and tosses four PINK PACKETS at Marlo

INT COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

Marlo seated at a table takes a voracious bite of a giant
MUFFIN She drinks her latte Suddenly--

VIOLET
Marlo

VIOLET a woman about Marlo’s age approaches the table She’s
unconventionally attractive with an artistic style She
carries a to-go box of coffee and her mouth is agape

MARLO
Vi

VIOLET
Holy shit

MARLO
You said it

They stare at each other for a moment stunned

MARLO (CONTD)
What are you doing in Rye

VIOLET
I’m here for a memorial My
friend’s dad passed away

MARLO
Oh I’m sorry

VIOLET
It’s fine He was a dick

Marlo’s sudden laugh is a GOOFY BARK She covers her mouth

MARLO
Jesus What was that

VIOLET
That’s the standard “Marlo laugh”
Somewhere between a bike horn and a
goose orgy I miss it

Violet pulls up a chair and sits down There’s ELECTRIC
NOSTALGIA in the air-- and also considerable awkwardness

VIOLET (CONTD)
So do you live here Fill me in on
everything I mean you randomly
dropped off Facebook like five
years ago never to be heard from
again so

This is lightly delivered but there’s hurt beneath

MARLO
I hate social media

VIOLET
We all do That’s the point It’s a
mandatory rage-fuck

MARLO
Ha Well I live here in town
Still married to Drew Two kids
Nothing’s changed

VIOLET
Mm I don’t know how to tell you
this but you’ve really blown up

Marlo laughs again

VIOLET (CONT’D)
No congrats Anyway I have to get
this coffee back to the house
before it gets as cold and black as
my womb Do you still have my
number

MARLO
The same one 718

VIOLET
Same number as always and same
address too

MARLO
(surprised
What You’re still at the loft

VIOLET
Mm-hm Still in Bushwick Building
went co-op years ago so I bought
the place I’m surrounded by
Millennials crying on the phone to
Mommy Call me sometime okay If
you feel like it

Marlo nods as Violet exits Once Violet is gone Marlo sits
and stares at her muffin for a moment Her cheeks are red
When she reaches for her latte the cup RATTLES briefly
against the saucer

INT MARLO’S CAR - NIGHT

Drew Marlo Sarah and Jonah are in the car headed to Marlo’s

cousins

SARAH

JONAH

pounds He can’t hurt you

Jonah moans worried as usual

MARLO
What is that dog’s name again

DREW
“Prosecco”

MARLO
I want to kill myself

SARAH

DREW
Mommy’s joking Like a clown

Marlo “honks” her own nose in response
MARLO
Beep-beep
EXT CRAIG AND ELYSE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Marlo’s older brother CRAIG lives in a newly constructed
“French”-style mansion with a motor court and fountain It’s

incredibly grand compared to Marlo and Craig’s little
rambler Jonah spots Craig’s new car

JONAH
Is that Uncle Craig’s electric car
DREW
Yeah it’s called a Tesla
SARAH
Can we get one
DREW
Nope
MARLO

You wouldn’t want one They catch
on fire all the time

Drew snorts at Marlo’s lie

JONAH

Greta grabs Jonah’s hand All five kids joyously run off
toward the playroom with Shasta

ELYSE
Shasta’s so awesome She has a
masters degree in Early Childhood
Education I feel like she should
be telling me what to do
(then)
Marlo you are glowing

Marlo looks like death warmed over

MARLO
Really I feel like an abandoned
trash barge

ELYSE
What

MARLO
In the eighties there was this
giant boat full of garbage that
just drifted up and down the East
Coast for weeks They couldn’t
figure out where to dump it
Eventually they docked the boat in
Brooklyn and burned all the trash

Elyse hesitates then laughs cheerfully

DREW
Marlo didn’t want to know this

day now

Craig and Elyse smile awaiting a response from Marlo Isnt
this exciting She fakes a smile

MARLO
Yep

INT CRAIG AND ELYSE’S HOUSE (DINING ROOM) - NIGHT

Marlo Craig and Drew walk into the dining room holding
drinks and chatting The table is gorgeous and rustic with
flickering candles and artfully mismatched plates and
goblets It’s perfect without trying too hard Marlo notices
that there are only four place settings at the table

MARLO
Where are the kids going to sit

ELYSE
Oh they’re with Shasta They have
their own little kid-friendly
spread Mac and cheese Kobe
sliders something green

She fiddles with her phone and speaks into it

ELYSE (CONT’D)
Siri Play Hamilton

Music fills the room via Wi-Fi Elyse looks pleased with
herself for liking hip hop

CRAIG

Marlo is confused for a beat then realizes Craig is
referring to her pregnancy He nods at her belly

Oh Yeah

MARLO

ELYSE

having three And the third kid is

always the

easiest

(to Craig)
Right Greta’s so chill

MARLO

ELYSE

hands full with Jonah
(quickly)

I don’t mean that in a bad way

He’s so great

DREW

No he’s tough He’s quirky The
school actually wants us to get him
a aide because the teacher can’t
handle him anymore

Marlo glances at Drew flustered that he would disclose this
Drew eats matter-of-factly

ELYSE

Oh Well that’s awesome
(spinning it)
That they’re you know recognizing

his needs

MARLO

Oh yeah they’re all over it

INT CRAIG AND ELYSE

S HOUSE (KITCHEN) - NIGHT

Elyse enters the kitchen protesting as Drew and Marlo
attempt to carry in the dirty serving dishes

ELYSE

Guys do not help I got it

She hands a platter to a waiting HOUSEKEEPER

Let me at

MARLO
least put this away

CRAIG
No You’re not allowed Besides I
want to show you something

MARLO
I saw the Tesla

CRAIG
Yeah yeah no Come here

He puts a brotherly hand on Marlo’s shoulder and steers her
away from the sink

INT CRAIG AND ELYSE’S HOUSE (TIKI BAR) - NIGHT

Craig has a TAHITIAN-STYLE home bar that looks like something
at a resort Marlo looks around at the decor

CRAIG
You like it

MARLO
It’s like I’ve been transported to
another room of your house

CRAIG
It was inspired by the most
beautiful place I’ve ever been

MARLO
Tahiti

CRAIG
Epcot

Marlo climbs awkwardly onto a stool Craig goes behind the
bar and pours himself a scotch and Marlo a pineapple juice

CRAIG (CONTD)
So I have a special baby gift for
you this time around

MARLO
Is it money

CRAIG
Ha ha It’s more like an
experience

MARLO
Okay

CRAIG
Have you ever heard of a night
nanny

Before Marlo gets a chance to reply

CRAIG (CONT’D)

(quickly)
Everyone does it I mean everyone
we know It’s like a regular nanny
but she only comes to your house at
night She stays over for a few
weeks-- or months-- and takes care
of the new baby so Mom and Dad can
get some sleep

His tone is cheerful careful What is he getting at

MARLO
How does that work Does this lady
breast-feed Jesus there’s nothing
you people won’t outsource

CRAIG
No She doesn’t breast-feed This
isn’t feudal China She wakes you
up to do
(gesturing awkward)
That But then you can go right
back to bed when you’re done

MARLO
Why have a baby if you’re not
willing to put in the time Sleep
deprivation is part of the deal
Besides I don’t want some stranger
in my house bonding with my newborn
at night That’s like a Lifetime
movie where the nanny tries to kill
the mom and the mom wins but still
walks with a cane for the rest of
her life

CRAIG
We had a night nanny

MARLO
You did I don’t remember that

CRAIG
That’s because she was only here at
night They come in and out like a
ninja I barely had any interaction
with the woman

(MORE)

CRAIG (CONTD)
(shrugging)
Elyse said she was great

MARLO
Craig you didn’t hire one of these
people for me did you

Craig’s tone becomes more serious

CRAIG
Marlo You’ve got a lot going on I
know this kid wasn’t planned okay
I know I know it’s a miracle and
the best thing ever and blah blah
blah

Craig lowers his voice

CRAIG (CONTD)
--But I don’t want what happened
last time to happen again

MARLO
Craig don’t

CRAIG
(interrupting)
I love you I don’t want to ever
see you that way (again)

MARLO
(over)
It won’t happen Just stop

CRAIG
Drew needs to focus on his career
He’s finally getting somewhere and
you can’t let this baby derail him
And you need to be there for Jonah
and Sarah Get them to school in
the morning Be “happy Mommy”
Awake Present Especially for
Jonah

The mention of Jonah gives Marlo guilty pause

CRAIG (CONTD)
I know you think this is some
bougie thing that rich assholes do
And maybe it is But remember I
wasn’t always a rich asshole
(MORE)

CRAIG (CONTD)
I grew up in the same shitty house
as you with the same shitty
parents and that shit-brown Buick
on the lawn And I’m telling you--
for the sake of your kids-- get
over yourself and call her

He reaches into his pocket and hands her a folded-up piece of
paper

CRAIG (CONTD)

This is the number Make whatever
arrangements you need for however
long you want She’1ll bill me we
already worked it out This isn’t
the person we used-- she was booked
until August-- but this one comes
highly recommended Think about it

Marlo tucks the folded paper into her pocket

MARLO
How much money does this cost

CRAIG
An assload
(then serious)
Think about it

INT MARLO’S CAR - NIGHT

Marlo is driving A tipsy Drew is in the passenger seat
Marlo rants about Craig’s proposal

MARLO
(mid-rant)

I mean I understand having a
cleaning lady or a babysitter or
whatever if you can afford it But
the “night nanny” thing just sounds
crazy Like what is this Downton
Abbey

DREW
It sounds pretty ideal to me Like
not having to wake up five times a
night or whatever

MARLO
You don’t wake up anyway

Her observation is matter-of-fact not hostile

DREW
I don’t have boobs Marlo

MARLO
Yeah that’s true

DREW
It’s not like I can do anything

They’ve arrives a stoplight Marlo looks out the window at a
group of YOUNG PEOPLE congregating on a sidewalk They’re
talking and laughing animated

MARLO
I’m fine with doing it myself
anyway You need to be rested for
work This is a big year for you

As she recites this she’s fixated on the young crowd

DREW
You’re sure you’re going to be
okay

MARLO

Of course

He notices that she’s spaced-out

DREW
Honey

MARLO
What

DREW

It’s green

The light has changed Marlo accelerates

INT MARLO AND DREW’S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT

The lights are off Drew sleeps Marlo is lying in bed
wrestling with a huge snakelike body pillow She can’t get
comfortable She settles for a moment We hear a distinct
POP Marlo’s eyes open

Marlo gets up and walks to the bathroom From her POV we
see WATER dribbling onto the floor with every step It’s not
the dramatic scene we see in movies just a tiny dribble But
it’s unmistakable

INT CAR - DAWN

A disoriented Drew drives to the hospital Marlo rides
quietly in the passenger seat

INT HOSPITAL (DELIVERY ROOM) - DAY

Drew holds Marlo’s hand while an ANESTHESIOLOGIST who looks
sixteen years old injects an EPIDURAL into her spine

INT HOSPITAL (DELIVERY ROOM) - DAY (LATER)

Marlo watches E News on TV in her hospital bed

INT HOSPITAL (DELIVERY ROOM) - DAY (LATER)

Marlo lies on her side checking her phone

INT HOSPITAL (DELIVERY ROOM) - NIGHT

Marlo is pushing out her baby A DOCTOR and a couple of
NURSES are there Drew stands by taking video with his phone
A not-particularly-meaningful SONG plays on someone’s iPod
The doctor is laid-back almost distracted

DOCTOR
Okay can you feel my hand inside
you Push against my hand One
two three

Marlo closes her eyes and pushes silently

INT HOSPITAL (RECOVERY ROOM) - DAY

Marlo is sitting up in the hospital bed still wearing a
hospital gown and tethered to an IV Craig and Elyse are in
the room Elyse holds the BABY making little cooing noises

ELYSE
Marlo she is your mini Look at
those lips

CRAIG

I wish we could stay but Emmy’s in
the middle school musical tonight

MARLO
What show is it

ELYSE
(proud)
Rent

CRAIG
I don’t get it It’s like just pay
your fucking rent Problem solved

Elyse is about to pass back the sleeping baby back to Marlo

MARLO
You can just put her in the
bassinet

ELYSE
Oh Okay

Surprised she places the baby in the hospital bassinet
Craig leans in and pats Marlo’s shoulder

CRAIG
You take it easy okay And tell
Dad congrats when he wakes up

Reveal Drew SOUND ASLEEP on a cot Craig and Elyse quietly
exit the room

Marlo swings her numb legs out of bed and tries to get up
It’s tough She looks over at Drew He is sound asleep on a
cot

Marlo manages to get up and walks gingerly toward the
bathroom dragging her IV behind her She stumbles into the
door frame Through the open back of her hospital gown we
see she’s wearing an ADULT DIAPER

Marlo reaches for the nurse call button

INT HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY
Craig and Elyse walk to the elevator

ELYSE
So did you talk to her about the
night nanny

CRAIG
Yeah She said she could never let
a stranger take care of her baby

ELYSE
Oh so she’s judging our choices
Nice

Craig pushes the elevator button

CRAIG
I just want my sister back The
last few years She used to be

happy you know

ELYSE
Wasn’t she also like totally
irresponsible

CRAIG
She got a little wild sometimes
sure But overall she was just fun
to be around Then she had the
kids Once Sarah came along it was
like somebody snuffed the match
And when Jonah was born

They shudder at the unspoken

ELYSE
Yeah that wasn’t pretty
(then)
Maybe you should call Drew and see
if he can convince her

CRAIG
Drew hates me

INT HOSPITAL (BATHROOM) - DAY

Marlo sits on the toilet in the cramped bathroom while a
motherly RUSSIAN NURSE encourages her

RUSSIAN NURSE
You have to show me you can do a
pee-pee

MARLO
It’s just not coming out

RUSSIAN NURSE
If you don’t pee soon we have to
put the catheter back in

Marlo strains desperately hoping to avoid this outcome We
hear a tricklingpouring sound

MARLO
There

She struggles to stand up The nurse glances into the bowl

RUSSIAN NURSE
That’s not enough

MARLO
Why is this so important

RUSSIAN NURSE
Don’t get angry

MARLO

I peed Why don’t you believe me
It’s in there I swear Run a test
or something

(angry)
How much do you fucking need Do I
have to spray it all over the room
You want a golden shower

RUSSIAN NURSE
You need to rest mommy

We hear the baby CRY OUT

RUSSIAN NURSE (CONT’D)
I can take her to the nursery

MARLO
No She needs me I’m the only one
who can do it

She staggers out of the bathroom toward her baby

INT MARLO AND DREW’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Marlo nurses the baby alone The TV flickers in the dark
living room It could be 200 am could be 400 Time doesn’t
exist anymore

The living room is temporarily “baby central” There’s a
portable BASSINET (known in parental circles as a Pack n’
Play) a pile of diapers and a makeshift CHANGING STATION on
a chair

Marlo closes her eyes She opens them Her arms are empty
THE BABY IS GONE

She leaps to her feet panics Scans the floor Runs to the
kitchen She hears a coo coming from the kitchen sink A
babys arm waving What is the baby doing in the sink

Marlo opens her eyes The baby is in her arms still nursing
It was a dream a weird one

Through a series of dissolves we see a MONTAGE of endless
grinding exhausting DAYS and NIGHTS of baby care We never
leave the living room Marlo sleeps on the couch with a
blanket and pillow-- when she gets to sleep

Marlo is suddenly DRIVING HER CAR Jonah is inexplicably (and
illegally) sitting in the front seat Marlo glances in the
rear view and sees the BABY lying in the back seat She SLAMS
on the brakes gasping She looks over at Jonah who has
turned into a DISAPPROVING OLDER WOMAN (Her mother)

Marlo suddenly wakes up in her makeshift bed on the couch

The baby is in her arms What time is it Hard to say Drew
in a suit and tie enters to kiss the baby goodbye and head

to work He looks so polished Marlo so feral

Marlo paces nurses feeds Her clothes change but they’re
all the same variation on T-shirt and sweat pants

Marlo is lying on the floor of a FOREST gazing up at the
sky Its peaceful for a moment Someone POKES her with a
stick in the shoulder Poke Poke Poke Poke

Marlo wakes up She’s fallen asleep sitting up Jonah is
repeatedly poking her in the shoulder with a TOY LIGHT SABER

Later Jonah and Sarah are watching cartoons Sarah tries to
snuggle up to her mom who barely responds

Marlo stares blankly at Barbie’s Mermaid Adventure Her eyes
brim with TEARS

INT SAINT VITUS SCHOOL - DAY

Marlo walks down the hallway with Jonah like a zombie She
carries the baby’s INFANT CAR SEAT by its handle it has a
muslin blanket draped over it so we can’t see the baby They
arrive at his KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM

MARLO
(distracted)
Love you

Jonah jumps up and down and licks Marlo’s sleeve clinging to
her She manages to detach him

MARLO (CONTD)
Okay Okay

Jonah dashes into his classroom Marlo continues down the
hallway

INT SAINT VITUS SCHOOL (PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE) - DAY

Laurie is seated at her desk drinking coffee and pushing
paper Marlo enters escorted by a MALE SECRETARY

MARLO
Hi

LAURIE
Hi Thank you so much for coming in
today I know mornings aren’t easy
Especially for you right now

MARLO
Why

Laurie gestures to the car seat warmly

MARLO (CONTD)
Oh yeah

Marlo sits down in front of the principal’s desk and places
the car seat on the floor Laurie obviously finds it a little
odd that Marlo doesn’t want to show off or talk about the
baby but says nothing She comes around to Marlo’s side of
the desk and sits in the other chair there

LAURIE
So we’re coming up on the end of
the kindergarten year and I just
wanted to talk to you about
Mister Jonah

Her quasi-affectionate use of “Mister” doesn’t mask the
tension

MARLO
We’re getting him the aide The one-
one aide We just have to figure
out how we’re going to pay

Her voice trails off She’s sick of talking about it

LAURIE

Right I know

(then)
Back when you guys applied we did
express some concerns about whether
or not Saint Vitus was the right
fit for Jonah But we love your
family and we have such a great
relationship with your brother and
his wife
MARLO
I know Jonah is only here because
of them

LAURIE
That’s not--

MARLO
No I know They’re big donors and
they called in a favor

Now Laurie is uncomfortable She takes a deep breath

LAURIE
We think Jonah might be better
served by a different school

MARLO
You’re expelling him

LAURIE
No Marlo Expulsion is a
punishment We would call this a
dismissal

MARLO
Oh

LAURIE
There are places better suited to
kids like Jonah

MARLO
What does that mean “kids like
Jonah”

LAURIE
Well you know Jonah is quirky

MARLO
(interrupting)
What is this “quirky” thing
everyone keeps saying
(officious voice)
“Parenting Your Quirky Child” It’s
so stupid What does it mean It’s
like do I have a kid or a fucking
ukelele Why can’t you say what you
mean which is that you think Jonah
is retarded And he’s ruining it
for all the other kids in the class
who are reading like The Iliad or
whatever
(MORE)

MARLO (CONTD)
Sorry about my retarded son Oh
I’m sorry quirky Because he’s a
pocket watch Fuck This

She stands up and grabs the baby carrier Mrs Bell is
alarmed

LAURIE
No no no Jonah is bright He’s
great It’s just not the right fit

MARLO
Just say what you mean You hate my
kid You hate us

The secretary appears having overheard the skirmish
LAURIE

(shaken)
Dallas please walk her out

MARLO

Don’t touch me Dallas
SECRETARY

I wasn’t--
LAURIE

You need to calm down I’m not
letting you leave like this

MARLO
Oh I leave like this every day
you just don’t know it This is the
real me when I’m not licking your
asshole Surprise

Marlo turns and accidentally SLAMS the unwieldy car seat hard
against the frame of the door We hear the baby SQUEAL
Laurie and the secretary gasp

MARLO (CONTD)
She’s FINE

She manages to exit leaving the stunned pair in her wake

INT VAN (PARKING LOT) - DAY

Marlo steps up into her van and manages to snap the baby’s
car seat into its base She climbs into the driver’s seat
and stares into space breathing heavily The baby begins

CRYING in the back seat

Marlo climbs into the backseat She finds a pacifier in the
baby’s seat and sucks on it to “clean” it

MARLO
Here

The baby rejects the pacifier

MARLO (CONTD)
(desperate)
Take it Just take it

The baby finally starts sucking Marlo collapses in the
unoccupied captain’s chair next to the baby Now it’s Marlo’s
turn to burst into TEARS Her shoulders heave

Marlo makes a decision She crawls down onto the floor of the
van and searches for something There’s a lot of garbage and
family detritus Then under the driver’s seat she finds
what she’s looking for

She unfolds the PIECE OF PAPER with shaking hands

MARLO (CONTD)
(reading)
Tully

INT MARLO AND DREW’S HOUSE (KITCHEN) - NIGHT

The kids are watching TV Marlo takes a FROZEN PIZZA out of
the oven and slaps it down on a cutting board She drains
some broccoli from a pot on the stove and divides it on to
two plates Just going through the motions

JONAH
Daddy

We hear the FRONT DOOR open The kids get up and run to the
door to greet Drew thrilled to finally get some attention

A suit-clad Drew walks in flanked by Sarah and Jonah

DREW
Frozen pizza all right
(noticing the TV)
I thought we weren’t doing screen
time during the week

Marlo just looks at him with hollow eyes Drew puts his palms
up helplessly

JONAH
Fine with me It’s your rule

He walks to the kitchen table and sits Marlo comes over with
the plates and sits down The kids take their places

MARLO
So uh I decided to call that
night nanny

DREW
(surprised)
You did
MARLO
What
DREW

I just-- you know Craig’s paying
for it so I’m sure he’1ll lord that
over us

He laughs barely masking his annoyance

MARLO
Oh I’m sorry I wouldn’t want you
to sustain a bruise to your ego
That’s cool I’1l1 just cancel I’‘11
just cancel and make another pot of
coffee We’re good

DREW
No no I’m sorry I didn’t mean--
(concerned)
Are you okay

Marlo shrugs

DREW (CONTD)
Guys is Mommy okay

SARAH
I don’t know

MARLO
She’s coming tonight at 1030

Jonah knocks over a GLASS OF MILK It spills directly onto
Marlo’s shirt and lap but she doesn’t flinch

DREW
Jesus Careful Jonah

Marlo peels off her shirt wordlessly She sits in a NURSING
BRA Her body is a deflated stretch-marked mess Drew looks
away Sarah’s eyes widen with comic amusement

SARAH
Mom what’s wrong with your body

INT MARLO AND DREW’S HOUSE (ENTRY) - NIGHT

Marlo sits in the dimly lit living room holding the baby
She watches HBO’s Cathouse with the closed-captioning on
Onscreen a naked PROSTITUTE negotiates with a john The room
is a wreck

We hear a soft KNOCK Marlo gets up and hurries quietly to
the door with the baby on her shoulder She opens the door
revealing TULLY the night nurse standing there bathed in
porch light

TULLY
Hello I’m Tully

Tully is in her early twenties Her hair is long she wears a
T-shirt and jeans and has a BACKPACK slung over her shoulder
There’s punky black EYELINER applied in cat-like swipes above
her eyes She looks like a friendly grad student with slacker
tendencies

Marlo is taken aback this is not what she expected

MARLO
Hi

TULLY
You must be Marlo

MARLO
Yes

TULLY
May I come in

Marlo steps aside wordlessly Tully enters
TULLY (CONTD)
(indicating the baby)

Who’s this

MARLO
You mean the baby

TULLY
Yes What’s her name

For some reason the question startles Marlo It’s as though
she’d forgotten the baby was human

MARLO
Her name is Mia

Tully is examining the baby who is snuggled against Marlo’s
shoulder We see the baby’s FACE for the first time Her eyes
are open She is beautiful

TULLY
Mia

Marlo rambles nervously
MARLO
It was my mother’s name I always
said I would use it But now it’s
really popular I guess

She shrugs as if apologizing for her choice

TULLY
Who cares

MARLO
What

TULLY

Who cares if it’s popular It’s a
beautiful name

She touches Mia’s cheek Mia coos Marlo is mesmerized by
Tully’s calm direct manner

MARLO
It is
(then)
How old are you

Tully smiles Marlo checks herself

MARLO (CONTD)
I’m sorry I just wasn’t expecting--

TULLY
Don’t apologize I get that a lot
I’m older than I look

There’s an awkward beat Then

MARLO
So how does this work

TULLY
How do you want it to work

MARLO
I have no idea

Tully strides confidently into the house proper Marlo
follows behind her as if being led into her own home

TULLY
I’m here to take care of you

MARLO
I thought you were here to take
care of the baby

TULLY
Well you kind of are the baby

Marlo chuckles confused

TULLY (CONT’D)
Even though this one’s been
earthside for three weeks her DNA
is still inside of you In fact
her cells will hang around in your
bloodstream for years

As she speaks Tully reaches for Mia Marlo hands Mia over
without hesitation surprising herself

TULLY (CONT’D)
And though Mia here will be her own
person someday right now she’s
still very much a part of you She
knows your voice your smell your
heartbeat And you know her better
than anyone You built her from the
toes up

Marlo just stares at Tully Then
MARLO

I feel like I don’t know her at
all yet

TULLY
It’1l come

She smiles reassuringly-- and we believe her

MARLO
Okay

They’re standing in the KITCHEN now

TULLY
I’1ll be here as long as you need
me You look like you could use
some rest Ill settle in with Mia
down here You go upstairs and
sleep

Marlo seems shocked by this suggestion

MARLO
Don’t I need to show you what
to do

TULLY

Are there diapers down here

MARLO
Yes

TULLY
Does she have a place to sleep

MARLO
There’s a bassinet in the den

TULLY
Then we’re good I’1ll come wake you
up when she’s ready to nurse

Marlo nods confused Sleep-deprived But game

MARLO
Okay See you soon

Tully smiles kindly

TULLY
“And so to bed”

MARLO
Hm

TULLY
Samuel Pepys He kept a diary
during the English Restoration

MARLO
Right Samuel Pepys

She turns shaking her head and heads toward the stairs
Tully looks down at Mia now awake and smiles beatifically

INT MARLO AND DREW’S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT

Marlo enters the bedroom Drew is in bed The lights are off
He wears a GAMING HEADSET as he plays SKYRIM on his Xbox He
pulls off his headset when he sees Marlo surprised

DREW
Hey

MARLO
The night nanny is here

DREW
Oh yeah What’s she like
MARLO
(whispering)
Weird
DREW
What
MARLO

She’s weird

DREW
Are you going to just leave her
down there with Mia

Marlo ponders this briefly

MARLO
Yeah

DREW
Okay

Marlo climbs into bed She closes her eyes overwhelmed by
the sudden possibility of sleep

A moment later she rises from the bed anxious She walks
toward the bedroom door Opens it revealing not the hallway
but

A BEACH

INT WATERS EDGE - DAY (DREAM)

Marlo is standing at the edge of the ocean in a bikini Her
body is beautiful like it used to be She runs her hands
over her flat belly

She looks down and sees MIA lying on the sand alert and
kicking

MARLO
(to Mia)
Dont go anywhere

She walks into the ocean Its beautiful The sun shines on
the water

Marlo ducks under Suddenly shes in a deep swimming pool
She swims down down

We hear the song “Blue” again but a muffled underwater
version

The floor of the pool is strewn with TOYS and random
detritus like an empty FROZEN PIZZA BOX

Theres a MERMAID down there Her hair undulates like kelp

The mermaid turns around smiles at her Its TULLY The Tully-
mermaid swims up to Marlo

TULLY
Dont come up too fast

MARLO
What

INT MARLO AND DREW’S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT

Marlo opens her eyes Tully is standing over her holding Mia
and speaking softly

TULLY
There you go Nice and easy Hi
Marlo She’s ready for you

Marlo is disoriented Hair is plastered to her cheek with
drool Drew is sound asleep next to her Mia fusses a bit

TULLY (CONTD)
I’1l help

She leans down and un-clicks the strap of Marlo’s nursing
tank top It’s a weirdly intimate gesture but appreciated
Marlo takes the baby wordlessly and feeds her Tully sits
cross-legged on the floor of the dark bedroom She stares
serenely at Marlo not breaking eye-contact

INT MARLO AND DREW’S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - MORNING
We hear the sound of a BABY STIRRING

Marlo wakes up It’s Saturday morning Birds chirp Drew is
still sleeping An audio-only BABY MONITOR is plugged in next
to the bed Mia’s little noises are being transmitted

INT MARLO AND DREW’S HOUSE (LIVING ROOM) - SAME

Marlo wanders downstairs She gasps The house is IMMACULATE
Almost unrecognizable The kitchen GLEAMS There are YELLOW
DAFFODILS picked from the back yard arranged in a vase

Marlo walks over to the bassinet Mia is swaddled neatly as
she stirs

Jonah emerges behind Marlo bleary-eyed in his pajamas

JONAH
Is it a school day or a family day

MARLO
It’s Sunday It’s a family day

Jonah looks around the room confused

JONAH
Why is it clean

MARLO
I dont know

EXT PARKPLAYGROUND - DAY

Marlo and Drew walk through a LOCAL PARK while Sarah runs
ahead in her SOCCER UNIFORM and Jonah rides a scooter

DREW
(incredulous)
So she was in our bedroom last
night

MARLO
Yes She brought Mia to me to nurse
and she just sort of sat in the
shadows and waited for me to
finish

DREW
And then she went downstairs and
chiseled the filth off our floors
Doesn’t she sleep

MARLO
Maybe she’s nocturnal Like an owl

DREW
Or Sarahs hamster Remember that
thing The wheel going all night
long
Sarah runs over interrupting the conversation

SARAH
Mom I need water

Drew rolls his eyes as Marlo dutifully produces a Thermos

DREW
The game didn’t even start yet

SARAH
So I’m thirsty

Marlo offers Sarah water Marlo resumes the conversation
MARLO
The nanny just seems so serene
Like she really enjoys taking care
of people

DREW
What’s wrong with her

MARLO
Right
INT Marlo AND DREWS HOUSE (LIVING ROOMENTRY) - NIGHT

Marlo is watching Cathouse again and holding Mia We hear
Tully’s soft signature knock Marlo hurries to the door

A smiling Tully casually attired in a Jayhawks T-shirt
stands on the threshold with her backpack

TULLY
Good evening

MARLO
Hi Hey I just wanted to thank you
for cleaning the house You really
really didn’t have to do that

TULLY
I enjoyed it I have an energy
surplus Like Saudi Arabia

MARLO
(WTF )
Oh all right

As they enter the den Marlo realizes that she has forgotten
to turn off the television A client and a topless hooker are
interacting on Cathouse

MARLO (CONTD)
Oh God I’m sorry

Embarrassed she reaches for the remote Tully stops her

TULLY
No What is this

MARLO
It’s an old reality show It’s
called Cathouse

TULLY
What’s it about

People are FUCKING on the TV screen
MARLO
Um the goings-on at a legal
whorehouse in Nevada Just you
know day-to-day operations

Tully looks at the smiling BLONDE onscreen

TULLY
Whos she

MARLO
That’s Air Force Amy

TULLY
Is she a pilot

MARLO
No I’m going to turn this off

TULLY
There’s really no need You’re
enjoying it

MARLO
I’m not enjoying it It just
happened to be on

She realizes she’s hit pause on the RECORDING she’s made

MARLO (CONT’D)
--my DVR

TULLY
Marlo I want to make it abundantly
clear that you can’t be self-
conscious around me This won’t
work if you are

MARLO
I’m just not used to being served
I guess

TULLY

Relax and accept my service
Pretend I’m Air Force Amy

The conversation has reached peak weirdness

MARLO
Okay Well I’m just going to go
upstairs and watch a movie with
Drew

Tully has scooped up a cooing Mia
TULLY

Have fun You know I can put on
headphones if you guys want to be

intimate

MARLO
We’re not loud I mean that’s
fine

Tully holds Mia up in Marlo’s face

TULLY
Kiss good night Tomorrow she’ll be
different

MARLO
In what way

TULLY
She’1l grow a little overnight And
so will we

With her eyes fixed warily on Tully Marlo leans in kisses
Mia’s cheek

INT MARLO AND DREW’S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT
Drew is watching Orphan Black on Netflix Marlo pulls out her
iPad from under the bed and immediately starts tapping away
Marlo and Drew don’t acknowledge each other
INT MARLO AND DREW’S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT
Marlo wakes up She massages her breasts they’re

uncomfortably full The clock on the night stand reads 207
am

INT MARLO AND DREW’S HOUSE (LIVING ROOM) - NIGHT

Marlo walks into the living room Tully is perched on a
chair holding Mia as she sleeps She smiles at Marlo

TULLY
Hi there

MARLO
Hey I think I need to nurse her I
feel like I’m going to explode

She subtly indicates her engorged boobs

TULLY
Sure Let’s do a dream feed

Marlo settles onto the couch while Tully hands her the baby
She lifts her shirt as a sleeping Mia latches on Marlo
WINCES in pain-- it’s intense

TULLY (CONTD)
She’s got a strong latch

MARLO
Yes she’s a barnacle

TULLY
If she’s a barnacle then are you a
boat or are you a whale

MARLO
I don’t know

TULLY
Well boats get hurt by barnacles
But whales don’t When a barnacle
latches onto a whales it’s
harmless It’s just a little
obligate parasite doing its thing

Tully smiles Marlo looks down at Mia’s little face choosing
not to continue with this odd conversation

TULLY (CONT’D)
Does she look like your other kids

MARLO
Huh Yeah she looks a lot like
Sarah My daughter

TULLY
What’s Sarah like

MARLO
Well Sarah’s eight She’s getting
to this age where she can be really
hard on herself And that makes me
nervous because it doesn’t get
better for girls you know

TULLY
No it doesn’t

There’s a KNOWING SADNESS in Tully’s voice

MARLO
And my son Jonah well he’s
pretty great But he’s exhausting
He all these weird behaviors and
anxieties We have to brush him
Like I have to brush his body at
night Like a horse

TULLY
Why

MARLO
Well a therapist told us that it’s
supposed to reduce his
sensitivities to everyday things
(sheepish)
(MORE)

MARLO (CONTD)
We can’t afford to take him to a
therapist anymore so I just
watched YouTube and learned the
exercises It’s called the
“Wilbarger Brush Protocol”

TULLY
“Protocol”

MARLO
Right It sounds like a Tom Cruise
movie except shitty and kind of
sad Anyway it’s my fault he has
all these issues

TULLY
Why is it your fault

Marlo hesitates She’s not ready to share this information
with a near-stranger

MARLO
I
TULLY
You don’t have to talk about it
(beat)
You seem like an amazing mom
MARLO
Yeah you’d be “amazed” by how much
I suck
TULLY
Why would you say that
MARLO

Well I know moms who are really
amazing They organize the class
parties and “Casino Night” and
they make little cupcakes with
googly-eyes All that stuff

TULLY
Youre laying bedrock they’re
planting flowers

MARLO
But I want to be the cupcake mom I
used to love to bake But now I’m
so exhausted Even getting dressed
feels like work

(MORE)
MARLO (CONTD)
Every morning I open my closet and
think “Didn’t I just do this” And
that continues for the rest of the
day “Didn’t I just do this” My
life is like stuck on repeat mode

TULLY
That’s the downside of living on a
planet with a short solar day
Although Jupiter’s even shorter

MARLO
Youre like a book of fun facts for
unpopular fourth graders

TULLY
Thank you
(then)
What do you do for work Marlo

MARLO
I’m the office manager at a company
that makes protein bars I have a
useless degree in Philosophy so
now I write emails letting people
know they can’t wear Crocs on
“casual Friday” Or sometimes you
know Ill make a sign for the
ladies room that says “Please stop
flushing tampons Your bitch-
missiles are clogging the pipes
XO Marlo” It’s deeply fulfilling

TULLY
What do you wish you did

MARLO
That’s the problem I don’t know
If I had some big dream that never
came true I could at least be
pissed off at the world Instead
I’m just pissed off at myself

TULLY
You’re empty

MARLO
Yeah

TULLY
No I mean you’re empty on that
side She’s done I’1l take her

-Or not Tully gently takes Mia from Marlo Marlo seems
reluctant to go back to bed She heads toward the stairs
then turns

MARLO
Thanks for the uh interview It
was cathartic

We sense that it really was

TULLY
Come back to the couch any time

She flashes Marlo the peace sign

TULLY (CONTD)
Marlo
MARLO
(turning
Hm
TULLY

I’m here to help you with
everything Not just Mia I can’t
fix the parts without treating the
whole

MARLO
No one’s treated my “hole” ina
long time

TULLY
Now if that were true we wouldn’t
have Mia Sleep tight

Jonah he’s almost too big to be held but he still fits

MARLO
Are we going to have a good day
today

Jonah MEOWS in response

MARLO (CONTD)
Oh youre a kitty

Marlo sees something on the counter it’s a tray of WHIMSICAL
CUPCAKES with GOOGLY EYES They’re beautifully decorated
even Pinterest-worthy

MARLO (CONTD)
What the f

Jonah scampers over to the cupcakes delighted

JONAH
Mom Did you make these
They’re funny

MARLO
They sure are

She picks one up admiring the craftsmanship

MARLO (CONTD)
You want to take these to school

JONAH
Yes For my friends

He hugs Marlo’s leg happily Heartbreaking

INT SAINT VITUS SCHOOL (JONAH’S CLASSROOM) - DAY

Marlo looking unusually bright and put-together walks Jonah
into his classroom She “wears” Mia in a comfy-looking WRAP
a far cry from the car seat she carried her in during the
last time we saw her at school

Class hasn’t started yet but around ten KIDS scamper around
socializing Marlo peels the foil back from the tray
flashing the cupcakes at Jonah’s teacher MRS MARVISH

MARLO
Okay if we brought in a treat
They’re nut-free

The handful of KIDS in the classroom roar with approval One
even runs up and hugs Jonah who beams But Mrs Marvish
seems oddly skittish

MRS MARVISH
What’s the occasion

MARLO
No occasion I just love to bake

Marlo reads Mrs Marvish’s nervous expression

MARLO (CONTD)
Oh You heard about it’s fine
I get it No hard feelings about
Jonah or anything

(MORE)

MARLO (CONTD)
In fact I kind of made these as a
peace offering You know I’m going
to bring one to Mrs Bell since
she’s the one I

Marlo plucks a cupcake from the tray as she stammers this
nervous apology

MRS MARVISH
Okay Thank you

MARLO
Have a good day

Laurie’s office door is open she’s discussing something with
her secretary Dallas Marlo knocks on the door frame When
Laurie and Dallas see Marlo they both BLANCH from fear Poor
Dallas practically jumps a foot

MARLO

Hi
(off their expressions)

Don’t freak out I’m here to
apologize for the other day I
brought an olive branch of sorts
Actually it’s a strawberry cupcake
with cream cheese frosting but who
wants a actual olive branch right
No thanks Bleh

She tentatively places the cupcake on Laurie’s desk

MARLO (CONTD)
Sorry I only brought one Dallas
Anyway um I was totally out of
line the other day I had a little
touch of the “baby blues” and I
think my hormones just got the
better of me But I have help now

LAURIE
I’m very pleased to hear that

MARLO
And I understand about Jonah
Sometimes it’s just not the right
fit

LAURIE
Youll find the right fit for him

MARLO
Public school Free of charge free
of Jesus

She grins triumphantly Laurie is not sure what to make of
Marlo’s manic humor but she smiles back

MARLO

(rambling)
--So then I stopped by the
Department of Education and they
told me the public schools provide
free occupational therapy for any
kid who qualifies You just have to
get something called an IEP but
the evaluation for that is free
too and I already called Early
Intervention to schedule it So
this could wind up being better for
Jonah than St Vitus ever was

DREW
Wow You’ve been really busy

MARLO
I’m just energized I guess Craig
was right Sometimes you just need
an extra pair of hands

DREW
And this is so delicious I want to
punch someone in the face How did
you make it

Marlo shrugs

MARLO
It’s so easy to roast a chicken
You just stick some lemons in the
cavity salt pepper and you’re
good to go

SARAH
Is the cavity the butt

DREW
Gross Sarah no

JONAH
What is it

MARLO
It’s just a big gaping hole where
the chicken’s guts used to be

SARAH
That’s worse than a butt

MARLO
You’re right Sarah it’s murder

Drew is a few yards away at the BAR A costumed PRINCESS
swishes past him with an armful of PARTY PROPS (wand bag of
dress-up clothes etc)She accidentally drops her tambourine

Marlo watches as Drew bends over to help the princess pick up
her items They chat for a moment The princess is basically
a rough-looking stripper in a ball gown but Drew is clearly
charmed

Craig suddenly and conveniently appears next to Drew and
joins the conversation It’s obvious the two guys are being
extra “on” for the princess who’s laughing Marlo can’t help
but notice how the girly costume and wig affect the two men

Drew notices Marlo watching with a wry expression and heads
back over Craig reluctantly follows Marlo clocks Craig and
Drews beers

Craig and Elyse appear at Drew’s side

ELYSE
Marlo seems really awake

CRAIG
Ha ha yeah she’s got the pep back

OVERSTUFFED BACKPACK on the floor of the kitchen and opens
the fridge like a hungry teenager Marlo can’t help but smile
as she paws through the food

TULLY
What’s that in the pitcher

MARLO
Oh I made sangria since it’s
getting warmer It always reminds
me of college

TULLY
You see You are a homemaker

MARLO
Because I made sangria People make
sangria in prison toilets

TULLY
I know It’s called “pruno” May I
have a glass

This request surprises Marlo coming from her baby’s
caregiver but she

MARLO
Uh sure I guess I’1l have one
too That’s polite hostessing
right

Marlo gets two glasses out of the cabinet
TULLY

A-1 Let’s take the baby outside
and enjoy the evening

MARLO
Sure

EXT MARLO AND DREWS HOUSE (BACK YARD) - NIGHT
Marlo and Drew’s back yard is small weedy and unimpressive--
no Japanese soaking tub But there are WHITE FAIRY LIGHTS

strung from the house to the detached garage and it’s cozy

Tully and Marlo (accompanied by Mia) sit on an outdoor couch
side by side sipping their sangria

TULLY (CONT’D)
Am I ever going to meet Drew

MARLO
(sarcastic
Sure let’s wake him up right now

TULLY
I mean isn’t he curious about the
person who’s ministering to his
wife and baby every night

MARLO
He’s curious He asks about you
But he’s-- well he’s not the most
social guy Like I love him but
he’s a nerd A real nerd not like
a postmodern nerd He’s the kind of
guy who went to high school wearing
a trench coat and a hat and not
even a little deodorant

Tully nods

MARLO (CONTD)
Anyway he works all day and then
he really does a lot with the kids
when he gets home Homework the
reading log all of it We make
their lunches together And then he
just shuts down He goes upstairs
and puts on his little headset and
then he’s just out

TULLY
Don’t you guys ever

MARLO

Have sex No We haven’t had sex in
months Maybe close to a year He
does puts a sock on the door to
warn me when he’s masturbating

TULLY
That’s considerate

MARLO
Are you in a relationship

TULLY
I’m in several

MARLO
Ha I was like you back in the day
I tried every horse on the
carousel And then I met Drew

TULLY
Which horse was Drew

Marlo tosses back the last of her drink

MARLO
Drew was the bench

She pours out more sangria for her and Tully

TULLY
But you love him

MARLO
Yeah Definitely I chose the right
person I know that

TULLY
Then why don’t you have sex

MARLO
Well I hold the baby all day It’s
me and her and it’s primal we’re
just like two gorillas at the zoo
Then nighttime rolls around and
I’m just supposed to switch gears
and go “Okay now I’m sexy Now my
boobs are supposed to be sexual
instead of two bags of milk in a
Canadian grocery store It’s like--
did you ever play Tetris When I
was a kid I used to play Tetris for
hours and hours I was addicted
And when I’d go to bed Id close
my eyes and I’d still see those
stupid bricks falling It’s like
that now except instead of bricks
it’s Mia I go to bed and I just
see Mia I smell her I feel her I
can’t turn it off

TULLY
I understand

MARLO
Of course you do
TULLY
I like Drew I like what I know of
him And I want you guys to stay
together

MARLO
Oh I do too I don’t want my kids
to grow up like I did I had three
stepmothers can you believe that
Krystal Tricia and Wei-Wei

TULLY
Then we need to fix this
Does Drew have any sexual
fantasies

Marlo is taken aback by this frank query

MARLO
Well I mean I’ve seen his browser
history Pretty basic stuff You
know girls from Florida with stars
tattooed on their ribs

Tully knows Marlo is holding back information

MARLO (CONTD)
Actually there is one thing
Drew worked at a diner when he was
in high school Washing dishes And
the waitresses they all wore those
little outfits with the hat He’s
had a fantasy about it ever since

TULLY
There’s a reason they call them the
formative years

MARLO
Yeah So I actually bought a
uniform a while back thinking I
would wear it and surprise him But
then I just never got around to it
And now my legs have veins my tits
have veins my body’s a relief
map of a war-torn country

TULLY
Do you still have it The little
uniform

MARLO

Yes but even if it fits it would
just be depressing
(MORE)

MARLO (CONTD)
You on the other hand-- you could
wear the shit out of it

She gives Tully an awkward once-over Tully raises an

eyebrow inspired

INT MARLO AND DREW’S HOUSE (STAIRS) - NIGHT

Marlo quickly tiptoes down the STAIRS holding a wadded of
clothing Tully sticks her HAND out of the bathroom dressing-
room style Marlo hands her the dress amused by the gambit

MARLO
Here Never been worn

There’s your trouble

Marlo waits outside the bathroom The door swings open Tully
does in fact look very cute

TULLY (CONTD)
Patty melt

MARLO
You should keep that Wow you have
had zero children

TULLY
Do you think I should leave it on
when we get upstairs or take it
off

MARLO

Tully smiles expectantly and squares her shoulders
MARLO (CONTD)
You’re joking
INT MARLO AND DREW’S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT
Marlo opens the door a crack Drew is sound asleep curled up
on his side of the bed The clock on the night stand reads
1210 AM

Marlo opens the door fully Tully walks in behind her

TULLY
(whispering)
Is this a Fifties diner I want to
be accurate to the period

MARLO
It’s just a regular diner

TULLY
Am I sassy

MARLO
Maybe just keep the dialogue to a
minimum

TULLY
Okay

Tully nods and walks over to the bed She gently wakes Drew

DREW

(groggy)
Huh Jonah

TULLY
Hi there I don’t think we’ve met
Will you be dining in today

Marlo nods reassuringly Drew in shock just stares at
Tully

Tully climbs on top of Drew effortlessly

TULLY (CONT’D)
If you’re not familiar with our
menu I recommend the egg cream

Drew struggles surprised

DREW
What the hell Marlo

MARLO
It’s okay Drew This is for you
Just go with it

Tully begins KISSING Drew Marlo walks to the side of the
bed Drew resists for another moment then surrenders Tully
begins pulling up Drew’s T-shirt

TULLY
We also have a wonderful selection
of pastries And I’ve just put ona
fresh pot of hot coffee

DREW
(helpless)
Okay
MARLO
(to Tully)
I’‘1l tell you what he likes
TULLY
Why don’t you show me I’m just a
trainee
MARLO
All right

Drew eagerly pulls off his shirt Tully pulls down his pants

Marlo gingerly creeps onto the bed and kneels behind Tully
She unzips Tully’s waitress uniform-- if it’s possible to do
so tenderly she does

She looks into Drew’s eyes over Tully’s shoulder He gazes
back at her with LOVE AND GRATITUDE in his eyes accepting
the gift without further question

INT DREW AND MARLO’S HOUSE (KITCHEN) - MORNING

The next morning over COFFEE They can barely make eye
contact Drew clears his throat While embarrassed he also
looks like the proverbial cat who ate the canary

DREW
Should we talk about last night

MARLO
We don’t have to

DREW
That was pretty kinky Where did
the costume come from

MARLO
Just a uniform supply place I was
really nervous you wouldn’t be up
for it

DREW
Are you kidding

MARLO
I was afraid you’d think I was
crazy

DREW
Why haven’t we ever done that
before

MARLO

It’s not like the opportunity ever
presented itself Hi Jo-Jo

Before she can finish explaining herself Jonah prances into
the room in his pajamas

JONAH

Marlo pulls him onto her lap

MARLO
A camel Were you in the desert
JONAH

JONAH
Yes
MARLO
Let’s see if we can make Mickey
Mouse

feel it

head to the refrigerator for eggs and milk

INT PARK (RUNNING TRAIL) - DAY

A running trail Marlo with earbuds in her ears is ready
for her first workout since giving birth She wears a sports

tank and sweats She starts JOGGING with a slow gait

There’s another RUNNER up ahead a college girl with a
ponytail a perfect ass and perfect running skills

Marlo runs faster Soon she’s gaining on the woman

Determined Marlo speeds up

She keeps running her cheeks red She’s pushing herself past
the point of exhaustion running like the T-1000

We see Sarah riding her bike nearby She pauses watching her
mom fly by She looks both impressed and confused

Marlo finally PASSES the girl She veers off the path and
practically collapses against a tree She’s panting red-
faced

The girl slows up as she approaches

RUNNER GIRL

spreading over her breasts

Marlo laughs at the utter absurdity of the idea

MARLO
Who’s going to take care of Mia

Oh I don’t know It’s almost as
though there’s another responsible
adult at this address Named Drew

MARLO
But what if she--

TULLY
Mia’s been sleeping through the
night for the last week Drew wont
even know we’re gone

You know I feel like I’ve been
very useful around here In many
regards And I don’t think this is
an unreasonable request I don’t
have a lot of friends my own age
due to the unusual nature of this
job and I just need to get out

And PS-- you do too You can’t be
a good mom without adequate self-
care

MARLO

I don’t know if getting shit-
wrecked in Manhattan qualifies as
“self-care”

TULLY
Okay You’re right
(then)
We’ll go to Brooklyn

Her smile is irresistible

studs I hardly recognize it

TULLY
Have you ever heard of the “Ship of
Theseus” paradox

MARLO
Yeah in college I think Which
one is that

TULLY

Let’s say you were to take a wooden
ship and replace one plank every
year Eventually the ship would be
made up of entirely new planks and
there would be nothing left of the
original ship So is it still the
same ship Or a new ship

A buzzed Marlo thinks about it very briefly

MARLO
New ship

TULLY
Why

MARLO

Because it just is Nothing’s the
same It’s a new ship baby
Nouveau bateau

Her French accent is absurd as she takes a swig of bourbon

TULLY
Then what about people When you
look at your baby pictures clearly
you’re unrecognizable compared to
now But it’s you

MARLO
If every part of me has regenerated
then I guess I’m not me anymore

for round with me Let’s just leave
the car here and take a cab back

Marlo braces herself against a parking meter
MARLO

Drew doesn’t get angry He just
gets very quiet

TULLY
And that’s worse than angry isn’t
it
Right As always
MARLO

This is the last thing you’re going
to talk me into Tully

TULLY
You’re right It is

MARLO
Oh you’re quitting

TULLY
You knew this was temporary
Besides I think it’s time for me
to find another line of work

MARLO
So what do you have lined up I bet
you have big plans Your twenties
are great But then your thirties
come around the corner like a
garbage truck at 5 am Yeah You
gotta think long-term What are you
going to do when that cute little
ass drops and your feet grow half a
size with each pregnancy and the
whole “free spirit” thing stops
being charming and starts looking
ugly

TULLY
I’m not afraid of the future

MARLO
You should be I’m it

TULLY
What’s wrong with that You know
what your problem is You’re
convinced you’re a failure but you
actually made your biggest dream
come true

MARLO
What

TULLY
I know how bad your childhood was
So now you’re giving your kids what
you never had That sameness you
despise That’s your gift to them
Waking up every day doing the same
things for them over and over even
though it grinds you down Yes you
are boring Your marriage is
boring your house is boring and
that’s incredible That’s the big
dream you had when you were young
To grow up and be dull and constant
and raise your kids in that circle
of safety You made it happen
Marlo You are a steady and elegant
mother Day after day Night after
night

MARLO
(whispering)
But I don’t feel safe I feel
scared

TULLY
That’s what I’m here for To keep
you safe so you can doing your
job We can’t afford to lose you

MARLO
Stop caring so much You’re such a
care lord

Marlo rubs her BREASTS wincing with discomfort

MARLO
Ow

TULLY
Youre really full

MARLO
It hurts I need Mia I’1l just go
home and feed her

Marlo is massaging her sore breasts compulsively

TULLY
No Not yet

MARLO
(crying)
I miss her

TULLY
You’1l see her soon Come on

MARLO
She won’t the same tomorrow That’s
what you said I don’t want her to
grow

TULLY
Yes you do

Tully beckons to Marlo Defeated Marlo stumbles toward
Tully Tully takes her arm and leads her away from the
building Marlo lays her head on Tully’s shoulder and cries

As they walk off into the night we suddenly hear a VOICE on
the intercom It sounds hoarse and disoriented

VIOLET (0S)
Hello Marlo are you out there

But Tully and Marlo are already out of earshot disappearing
into the night

VIOLET (0OS) (CONT’D)
Marlo

INT SEEDY DIVE BAR - NIGHT

Tully and a disheveled Marlo enter a SEEDY DIVE BAR they
definitely don’t belong at

Tully guides Marlo toward the bathroom The door SWINGS OPEN
A truly DISGUSTING DUDE is walking out We can see even from
this vantage point that it’s not an appealing place to deal
with the milk situation But Marlo is desperate

INT DIVE BAR BATHROOM - NIGHT

Tully and Marlo enter the bathroom It’s Trainspotting-
filthy with grafitti on the walls Tully takes off her
SWEATER and wets it in the sink under hot water

MARLO
What are you doing

TULLY
I’m making a hot compress It’1l
feel like a little baby mouth

MARLO
This is really messed up

TULLY
It‘ll help get things going

She hands Marlo the makeshift compress Marlo puts it on her
boob dutifully

TULLY (CONTD)
Okay Now milk yourself

Marlo stands over the toilet and starts massaging herself

MARLO
It’s not working
(gagging)
Oh God it smells like Spam in
here

TULLY
Think about Mia Do you have a
photo That might help

She takes Marlo’s phone out of her purse and quickly pulls up
Marlo’s PHOTOS She scrolls through looking for a photo of
Mia We glimpse a lot of weird SELFIES of Marlo

TULLY (CONTD)
Why do you have so many pictures of
yourself

MARLO
I keep thinking the next one will
look different

Tully finds a photo of Mia and holds the phone in front of
Marlo’s face Someone BANGS on the door

TULLY
One second

MARLO
I’M PERFORMING A MIRACLE
(then)
It won’t come out

TULLY
Let me Do you mind

Marlo tacitly agrees Tully begins kneading Marlo’s breast

TULLY (CONT’D)
You have to use a rolling motion

Marlo looks queasy Tully rolls her hand back and forth

TULLY (CONTD)
See It’s like a wave

MARLO
I think I’m going crazy

We hear a TRICKLING sound as Marlo’s milk finally lets down
into the toilet bowl below

TULLY
There we go

Marlo VOMITS Tully holds back her hair When Marlo comes up
for air Tully is already there to gently wipe Marlo’s mouth
with a napkin

TULLY (CONTD)
Now we’ll go home
INT MARLO’S CAR - NIGHT

Marlo is slumped in the front seat Tully is in the drivers’
seat For the first time ever she seems NERVOUS

TULLY
Try to stay awake

MARLO
I’m so tired

TULLY
I know But I need you to stay
with me Let’s have a conversation

MARLO
All we do is converse We’re like
the people in a Spanish textbook
Maria and Julio they never shut
up
(then)
What am I going to do without you

TULLY
Youre going to take care of
yourself You’re going to shower
every day nourish and exercise
your body and maybe even send
yourself roses once in a while
Promise me you will

MARLO
(drifting off)
That’s so corny
TULLY

Look Marlo it’s the bridge
They’re approaching the BRIDGE that takes them back to Rye

TULLY (CONTD)
Look You’re going to be in a soft
bed in your little house before you
know it Under the same roof with
your three babies cozy and
crowded That old carpeting in your
bedroom World’s weakest shower
Home

MARLO
Mmph

TULLY
We’re going home

Tully begins to lose control of the vehicle First subtly
and then it’s beyond saving

In an instant the car CRASHES into a guard rail Marlo’s
eyes briefly open Another car plows into them Black water
Silence

A flashback to Marlo’s DREAM the first night she met Tully A
vision of the TULLY-MERMAID in the pool her back turned
swimming away forever

SIRENS the groan of a TOW TRUCK The surprisingly mundane
conversation of PARAMEDICS

PARAMEDIC 1 (0S)
Can you pass me that gauze Yeah I
didn’t even know they had pizza
But it wasn’t bad

PARAMEDIC 2 (0S)
Let’s get another blanket here

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Marlo lies asleep in a hospital bed She’s BEAT UP There are
cuts and lacerations on her face She has a black eye a
broken arm and her leg is in traction

Drew sits on a chair next to her bed pale and gravely
concerned The room is silent

DR SMYTHE a middle-aged woman knocks and enters

DR SMYTHE
Hi You are Marlo’s husband

DREW
(rising)
Yes I’m Drew

DR SMYTHE
I’m Dr Smythe I’m on the
psychiatric staff here I’d like to
talk to you about Marlo

DREW
Okay

DR SMYTHE
Not here Let’s let her nap
INT EMPTY HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Drew and Dr Smythe are in an empty hospital room or office
away from where Marlo can hear them

DR SMYTHE
Does she have a history of mental
illness

DREW

No Well yeah She had some
depression after our son was born
five years ago It was pretty bad

DR SMYTHE
When you say “bad”

DREW
She didn’t want to hold him She
couldn’t look at him She just
wasn’t herself for months She
actually well she did try to--
(flustered)
Just tell me what’s going on

DR SMYTHE

We think she’s experiencing
something similar now but on a
more extreme scale This is what we
call “postpartum psychosis”

Drew is flabbergasted

DREW
Psychosis

DR SMYTHE
Yes It’s a lot more serious than
just depression It’s characterized
by hallucinations delusions

DREW
But she’s been amazing She’s so
different this time Her brother
got her a night nanny to help out
and she’s getting sleep

DR SMYTHE
Actually we believe she’s
suffering from extreme exhaustion
and sleep deprivation

DREW
Oh How
(surprised)
I didn’t know She seemed better
than she’s ever been
(thinking)
(MORE)

DREW (CONTD)
I mean there have been a couple of
things that were out-of-character
but I just I just can’t believe
she would drive drunk like that
And she just disappeared without
telling me There was no one
watching the baby

DR SMYTHE
Weren’t you home

DREW
Well yeah but

DR SMYTHE
What about the night nanny

DREW

I don’t know where she was I don’t
know anything about her it was
Marlo’s thing Can I go back in
there please

DR SMYTHE
They actually need you to finish
some of the paperwork at Admitting
Then well reconvene

DREW
Okay
INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Marlo lies in bed woozy and dreamy She stares at the TRAY
next to her bed Untouched food a plastic pitches or water

There’s a KNOCK She manages to turn and look at the door
MARLO
(whisper )
Come in

INT HOSPITAL (ADMITTING DESK) - DAY

Drew walks up to the ADMITTING area where a female EMPLOYEE
surrounded by files taps away on a computer

DREW
Hi Did you guys need some
information on Marlo Moreau

HOSPITAL EMPLOYEE
Moreau yes I have almost
everything I need Do you have your
insurance card

Drew digs the card out of his wallet

DREW
Yes yes

He hands the card over The employee begins typing rapidly on
her keyboard and asking questions in the familiar
distracted tone of those who do such work

HOSPITAL EMPLOYEE
-And the patient’s date of birth

DREW
6777

HOSPITAL EMPLOYEE

(typing)
-Last four digits of her social

DREW
Um 8734

HOSPITAL EMPLOYEE

Drew is distracted checking his phone as he replies
DREW
Tully
INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
The door to Marlo’s hospital room swings open It’s Tully
uninjured No worse for the wear She smiles apologetically

at Marlo

TULLY
Hey You’re a little beat up

MARLO
You should see the river

Marlo’s voice is an exhausted croak

MARLO (CONTD)

I didn’t tell anyone About you
They don’t even know you were
there

TULLY
You can tell them if you want to
It’s okay The people here will
understand

MARLO
I don’t know if they will

Tully sits down on Marlo’s bed

TULLY
We can’t see each other anymore

MARLO
I know

TULLY
This was supposed to be temporary
anyway A few weeks Just until the
smoke cleared

MARLO
What do I do now

TULLY
What you’ve always done And then
youll do it again And they’1l
grow and you’1ll grow and one day
you’1l rest and you’1l wish you
could do it all over

MARLO
If I’m older how are you wiser

TULLY
Because I have lots of time to
think about stuff Remember

She smiles and smooths Marlo’s hair back from her forehead
Marlo takes Tully’s hand and holds it

MARLO
Thank you for keeping me alive

TULLY
Same

INT HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY
Drew is heading back to Marlo’s room He passes Tully in the

hallway as they head in opposite directions He doesn’t
notice her Of course

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Drew enters He sees that Marlo is awake and stops in his
tracks

DREW
MARLO

Drew reaches out and touches Marlo’s hand

DREW
Um
(choked up)
I’m sorry
MARLO

Why are you sorry
Drew is trembling

DREW
I’m sorry I let this happen to you

MARLO
You didn’t do anything

Drew starts crying

DREW
I know That’s the problem I
didn’t know what was happening at
night I was just overwhelmed
between the baby and work and it
seemed like you were doing great

MARLO
I was doing great
(smiling)
Wasn’t I great

DREW
Fuck that I don’t need you to be
great I just need you to be you
We love you so much I’m sorry if
you want to run away I do too But
I don’t because I love us

MARLO
I love us too
(then)
Am I in trouble

DREW
Yeah You’re in trouble

Marlo nods painfully Drew lays his head on her chest She
touches him with her good hand

DREW (CONT’D)
Who were you with last night

MARLO
Nobody

Tears slide down her cheeks

MARLO (CONTD)
But next time I want to be
with you

DREW
Yeah

MARLO
Yes Let’s go out Let’s talk
There’s still a world out there We
could go see it sometime Even if
it’s just for a few hours

DREW
Okay

MARLO
Okay

INT MARLO AND DREW’S HOUSE (HALLWAY) - NIGHT

Weeks have passed Marlo walks down the hallway of her house
with a CANE Her bruises have faded to yellow but her arm is
still ina sling

She stops into Sarah’s room Sarah is laboring over her
homework as usual Marlo leans over Sarah’s desk murmuring
guidance then tousles her hair

INT MARLO AND DREW’S HOUSE (JONAH’S BEDROOM) - NIGHT

Marlo moves on down the hallway to Jonah’s room Jonah sits
patiently in his pajamas awaiting his treatment as he does
every night Marlo is there to attend to him She props her
cane against the wall and limps toward him

MARLO
Ready

As in the beginning we hear “Major Tom” from Jonah’s
Langley Schools Music Project album

Marlo reaches for Jonah’s WILBARGER BRUSH

MARLO (CONTD)
Let’s start with your feet tonight

She begins sweeping the brush over the soles of his feet

JONAH
Mom is this real

Marlo pauses

MARLO
What do you mean

JONAH
Does it work We do it every night
but I’m not sure what it’s supposed
to do

Marlo thinks about it
MARLO
Well honestly I don’t know Do

you like when we do it

JONAH
I like being by you

Marlo smiles

MARLO
I like being by you too
JONAH
And it feels nice I guess
MARLO
Well maybe that’s all that
matters
JONAH

But we can just be together We
don’t have to do the brush I kind
of don’t think it’s real

MARLO
Okay If you don’t think we need
it then I guess well stop

She puts the brush down and rests her chin in her hands

Jonah suddenly leans forward and puts his arms around her

JONAH
I love you

The SONG ends

MARLO
I love you too

They’re still wrapped in an embrace

JONAH
Can you play the song again

MARLO
The same one

JONAH
Yes silly mommy Always the same
one

Marlo leans over to the CD player She presses “play” on the
track again starting the song

Then she presses “repeat” ensuring that Jonah will hear it
as many times he wants

Jonah and Marlo rock back in forth in an embrace as Major Tom
counts down again for the hundredth time the thousandth

THE END
