FADE IN

EXT COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

The end of Winter SNOW blankets the landscape A SMALL
STREAM rushes through the VALLEY A clear blue sky hangs over
the DISTANT MOUNTAINS adding to the beauty of the setting

SUPER IMPOSE SCOTTISH LOWLANDS - 1665

The CAMERA begins to PAN The color of the SNOW begins to
change darkening from PURE WHITE to ASH GRAY eventually to
COAL BLACK We continue to pan until we arrive at

EXT VILLAGE - DAY

Plague Once a charming settlement it is now ravaged by
disease Everywhere BONFIRES burn sending plumes of BLACK
SMOKE rising into the sky -- the ash and soot drift back down
blackening the earth VILLAGERS scurry about in tattered
clothing their faces soiled by soot as they throw objects of
WOOD and CLOTH into the fires

THREE HORSEMEN ride into the village Two of them we can see
clearly as large powerful men with savage faces The THIRD
MANS mans face is hidden from us in the shadows of a black
HOODED CAPE He dismounts motioning for the other two to wait
for him

The Hooded Man walks though the village The SOUND of
HAMMERING fills the air as several VILLAGERS finish building a
make-shift GALLOWS

CUT TO

EXT CHURCH - DAY

Built of stone it is already centuries old A VILLAGER stands
guard at the entrance The Hooded Man approaches and WHISPERS
something in the Villagers ear then holds up a GOLD PIECE
INT CHURCH - DAY

Dark and musty lit only by shafts of LIGHT which flow in
through the windows The Hooded Man follows the Villager
across the stone floor until he reaches a WOODEN DOOR at the
back

INT STONE ROOM - DAY

No windows The Hooded Man enters In the center of the room
a CIRCLE has been drawn Bordering the circle are hundreds of
CANDLES forming a ring of fire A MAN stands in the center
his head bowed -- his weight supported by thick ROPES around
his wrists that are fastened to a wooden beam which runs the
length of the room

HOODED MANS VOICE
Vieira

VIEIRA looks up He is old his hair thin and gray but his
eyes are alive defiant The Hooded Man moves closer Vieira
follows him with his eyes trying to see the Hooded Mans face
Vieira strains against his ropes The Hooded Man does not
move

VIEIRA
How comes it your are not afraid

HOODED MAN
Wouldst you harm one who comes to
aid you

Vieiras silence indicates he is listening

HOODED MAN
(continuing)
Ive come to strike a bargain with
you I wish to learn the power of
changing

VIEIRA
And what wouldst I gain from this
bargain

HOODED MAN
(nonchalantly)
Your life

VIEIRA
How

The Hooded Man slowly pulls back his hood We see his face for
the first time It is hard brutal his eyes cold and dark
He grins -- a wicked grin

HOODED MAN
I have a magic of my own

The Hooded Man removes a KNIFE from under his coat He holds
it before Vieira then he quickly stabs it into his chest His
face fills with pain -- blood flows from the wound -- he falls
to his knees A beat He slowly looks up at Vieira as he
pulls the knife from his chest then stands unharmed Vieira
cannot believe what he has seen

HOODED MAN

Teach me the chant and I will take
your place on the gallows

EXT CHURCH - LATER - DAY

A GROUP of RELIGIOUS-LOOKING MEN walk toward the church

INT STONE ROOM - DAY
Vieira has finished teaching the chant

VIEIRA
After you recite the chant you must
concentrate of the form you wish to
take The stonger you are the longer
you can hold the illusion

In the bg we HEAR the SOUND of FOOTSTEPS coming up the
stairs Vieira looks at the Hooded Man

VIEIRA
They come Quickly take my place

The Men enter One of them looks at the Hooded Man

RELIGIOUS MAN
What are you doing here

The Hooded Man stares at him -- a hard unnerving stare -- then
slowly his thin lips from a cruel grin

HOODED MAN
Just saying goodbye to an old friend

Vieira stares at the Hooded Man angrily
VIEIRA
We had a bargain You promised

HOODED MAN
I lied

The Hooded Man walks from the room

EXT CHURCH - DAY

The Hooded Man walks out The TWO HORSEMEN ride up The
Hooded Man climbs on his horse He takes a DEEP BREATH as he
looks at a RANGE OF MOUNTAINS in the distance

CUT TO

EXT VALLEY - DAY

The SOUND of SWORDS CROSSING fill the air Two MEN one YOUNG
the other OLD fight across the SNOW-SWEPT GROUND In the bg
a large stone building is built at the base of a mountain
range

The Young Man fights furiously his only weapon strength but
he is clearly inexperienced The OLD MAN is agile and easily
moves out of the way of each blow The Young Man swings
wildly he loses his balance The Old Man strikes his SWORD
away then pushes him to the ground The Young Man looks up as
the older man raises his SWORD above his head Their eyes
lock The Old Man smiles and slowly lowers the sword to the
Young Mans neck

OLD MAN
Its over

The Old Man reaches out his hand helping the Young Man to his
feet The Young Man is clearly angry

OLD MAN
Your anger blinds you You must
learn to control it When the time
comes youll only have but one
chance You best use it well

INT STONE BUILDING - DAY

Large and barren A fires roars in the fireplace The Old Man
sits across a wooden table from the Young man as they finish
eating

The Young Man appears restless He pushes his plate
away -- stands up and walks toward the door

OLD MAN
Where are you off to

YOUNG MAN
To the village for some ale -- and if
the truth be known I need to see
someones face other than yours old
man

They smile The Young Man takes his SWORD then puts on his
COAT He picks up a SACK and leaves The Old Man begins to
clear away the dishes Suddenly he stops -- his smile fades
He looks towards the door filled with a premonition Outside
we HEAR the SOUND of SWORDS CROSSING It lasts only for a
moment SILENCE

A blinding GREEN LIGHT fills the frame of the door The ground
begins to TREMBLE -- the STONES of the building shake from the
force -- debris falls from the ceiling It stops SILENCE

The Old Man takes his SWORD from the mantle The DOOR OPENS
The SOUND of the WIND rushes in Outside nothing can be seen -
- only the darkness of the night A beat The Young Man
enters the room The Old Man smiles at the sight of him The
Young Man places his sack on the table

The Old Man turns his back as he starts to replace his sword on
the mantle The Young Mans expression hardens He stares at
the Old Mans neck as he starts to raise his sword

OLD MANS POV

In a SILVER WINE CHALICE he sees the reflection of the YOUNG
MAN who is now slowly raising his SWORD and about to strike at
the Old Mans neck

In one fluid movement the Old Man unsheathes his sword then
turns quickly The Young Mans blade slices through the air
missing its target The Old Man pivots and slices his blade
across the Young Mans chest The Young Man winces in pain
then takes a deep breath -- his body begins to shake violently

A TRANSFORMATION BEGINS The image of Young Man begins to fade
and is replaced by the HOODED MAN He LAUGHS LOUDLY as he
holds up his arms as if prompting The Old Man for his
appreciation of the illusion

OLD MAN
(hatefully)
Kilvara
The Hooded Man smiles when he hears his name

KILVARA
It flatters me you remember old one
Its been what two hundred years
OLD MAN

Its not been long enough What
witchcraft is this

KILVARA
Impressive -- is it not The problem
is I can only keep the illusion for a
few minutes I need more power to
hold the form longer I need the
Highlander Where is he

OLD MAN
I do not know -- and even if I did

KILVARA

(cutting him off)
I know I know-- you would not tell
me Loyalty -- it really is a
concept that eludes me

(shrugs his

shoulders)
Oh well -- I shall find him Time is
on my side

The Old Man looks sadly at the open door Kilvara notices and
grins

KILVARA
Is this what youre looking for

Kilvara opens the SACK Inside it is the head of the Young
Man Kilvara LAUGHS a deep guttural laugh He turns and
starts towards the door Suddenly he stops and turns back to
face the Old Man

KILVARA
(mockingly)
Oh -- I almost forgot Your head

OLD MAN
It does not come off as easily as the
young ones

KILVARA
(amused)
Perhaps -- but it comes off none the

EXT MOUNTAIN - WIDE SHOT - NIGHT

The RUMBLING SOUND subsides In the distance we hear the
savage SCREAM of Kilvara The CAMERA MOVES UP the side of the
mountain As we come over the top we see

SMASH CUT TO

EXT NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

The familiar towers of the city skyline stand along the bay
their LIGHTS reflecting off the water

EXT STREET - NIGHT

A thick FOG hangs in the air A light wind blows moving
newspapers and other articles of trash along the deserted
street

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT

Crates and trash dumpsters line the alley A single naked
light bulb shines down like a spotlight Through the fog the
SILHOUETTE of man appears as he steps under the light

MOVING WITH THE MAN - REVERSE SHOT

We follow the man from behind He is tall dressed in a long
tan rain-coat jeans and sneakers A small TRAVEL BAG is slung
over his shoulder As he moves down the alley he hears a
SCRAPING SOUND HE stops -- but does not turn around

A street PUNK emerges from behind a trash crate scraping the
BLADE of his KNIFE along the wall of a building He studies
the man for a moment as he runs his thumb along the edge of the
blade almost caressing it

PUNK
Whatcha got in the bag

Not only does the man not answer -- he doesnt even turn
around

PUNK
Hey -- you hear me
CONNER MACLEOD slowly turns around He is mid thirties
handsome his chin dotted with the stubble of a beard He is

calm detached -- yet under the surface there is a great
sadness from a lifetime of pain and loneliness He stares at
the Punk wearily -- knowing both what is going to happen and

what the outcome will be

MACLEOD
(softly)
Yes -- I hear you

PUNK
Good Now give it up

Macleod studies the Punk for a moment

MACLEOD
Go home -- while you still can

Macleod turns his back to him and starts to walk away The
Punk moves after him quickly Macleod reaches into a trash can
and pulls out a piece of PIPE The Punk stops and stares at
Macleod

PUNK
(amused)
What do you think youre gonna to do
with that

Macleod raises the pipe twirling it around expertly in his
hand

MACLEOD
(deadly calm)
Lets find out

A beat The Punk is losing confidence He looks at Macleod
CLOSE ON MACLEODS EYES

Deep Confidant They radiate an intensity that seems to burn
into the Punk

The Punk is unnerved by Macleods calm Macleod waits letting
him make the next move A beat The Punk backs away and
disappears into the darkness Macleod stares him for a moment
then drops the pipe to the ground and walks off in the other
direction

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Macleod stops at the mouth of the alley where it intersects
with the street He stares across the street
MACLEODS POV
An old building A sign reads RUSSELL NASH ANTIQUES

A sadness falls across his face -- his mind floods with
memories as he looks at the building

Across the street the door of the antique store opens RACHEL

an attractive woman in her fifties exits -- locks the door --
walks down the street

Macleod watches her affectionately -- painfully As she
crosses the street he steps back into the shadows of the
alley hiding in the darkness Rachel reaches the alley then
stops -- thinks -- looks back at the Antique Store She is
only a few feet away from Macleod

CLOSE ON MACLEOD

Macleod struggles to make a decision Slowly he raises his
hand -- reaches out -- but cannot bring himself to touch her

Rachel starts to walk away

MACLEOD (OS)
Rachel

No more needs to be said She recognizes the voice instantly
She turns around slowly and looks behind her In the bg
Macleod steps out of the darkness He smiles at her weakly

Confusion fills her face but is quickly replaced by a wave of
emotion She moves towards Macleod slowly as if trying to
determine if he is really there She cups her hands to his
face and stares deeply into his eyes No words are spoken --
none need to be The power of their feelings are shown in
their eyes

CUT TO

INT ANTIQUE STORE - NIGHT

Crowded with tables chairs cabinets and other rare old
objects of furniture Macleod is seated at a 17th century
dinning table Rachel stands in the center of the room

RACHEL
You know its not safe here for you

MACLEOD
I know
RACHEL
The police still have a lot of
questions for Russell Nash

MACLEOD
I can take care of myself

Rachels emotion builds

RACHEL
Why are you here Conner After
seven years without a word why have
you come back You went off to make
a new life with Brenda and that was
the last I heard--

A sadness falls over Macleods face

MACLEOD
Brendas dead

Rachel is stunned

MACLEOD
(continuing)
Four years ago Ive nowhere else to
go Youre all I have Rachel -- and

Im just so tired of being alone
His words touch her She opens a cabinet and pulls out a
bottle of GLENMORGANGIE scotch Macleod forces a weak smile
In the light he looks tired She pours him a drink

RACHEL
It isnt over is it Conner

MACLEOD
(wearily)
No

RACHEL
How can that be

MACLEOD
I dont know

Rachels face fills with compassion She reaches out and holds
Macleod He lays his head on her shoulder like a baby

INT LIBRARY - NIGHT

Every inch of wall-space is filled with shelves and BOOKS
Macleod walks along a row studying the titles A faint grin
falls across his face as he sees a selected works of poetry

Rachel enters the room with a tea service and places it on the
table

RACHEL
Is there anything else you need

MACLEOD
No -- Im fine Thank you

RACHEL
Im glad youve come home Conner

MACLEOD
Me too

Rachel leaves Macleod takes a small book off the shelf and
looks through it Outside a STREAK of LIGHTNING cuts across
the night sky Macleod looks out the window concerned

EXT FARM - DAY

Seventeenth century Scotland The CAMERA rise over an old
stone wall A charming farm house with stone walls and a
thatched roof sits in the distance Smoke drifts lazily from
the chimney

IN THE FIELD

A man toils behind an ox his arms straining as he guides a
plow through the soft earth He stops runs his hand across
his brow then turns around It is Macleod His hair is
longer but he looks exactly the same

The FARMER and owner of the land a kindly-looking man in his
fifties walks over to him He picks up and handful of soil and

tastes it

FARMER
It will be a good harvest this year

MCCLEOD
Can you really tell from doing that

FARMER
What do you think

MCCLEOD
I think you just like to eat dirt

They both LAUGH SARAH fifteen years old with flaxen hair
and bright blue eyes approaches Macleod with a water pale

SARAH
(shyly)
Would you care for some water
Conner

MCCLEOD
Aye -- that I would lass

Conner takes the ladle and pours it over his head He scoops
out some more water and drinks then WINKS at Sarah She
blushes and runs off

FARMER
I think my Sarah fancies you Conner

MCCLEOD
Shes a treasure she is

FARMER
Shell soon be of age

Macleod understands him only too well

MCCLEOD
Your words are kind and they flatter
me -- but I think of her as a sister

Besides you hardly know me

FARMER
I know that for six months youve
worked hard and asked for little
That youre a good and honest man
What more need I know

The conversation is interrupted by the SOUND of HORSES HOOVES
thundering across the fields TWO MEN dirty and rough-looking

ride up to the house They have the look of warriors to them
The Farmers wife and Sarah stand outside the house

EXT FARM HOUSE - DAY

The Farmer arrives out of breath from his run across the
field In the bg we see Macleod going into the barn

FARMER
Good day

The Men do not answer The Farmer is nervous He has seen men
like this before A few other FARM HANDS mostly OLD MEN and
WOMEN come in from the fields

FARMER
You are welcome to share our food and
our fire

WARRIOR 1
We do not share old man We take

Warrior 1 dismounts His eyes fall on young Sarah He looks
back at his friend with a toothless grin

WARRIOR 1
You can eat if you want Im going
to start with her

Warrior 1 walks towards Sarah who clings to her Mother The
Farmer stands in the path of the Warrior

FARMER
No

Warrior 1 backhands the Farmer across the face sending him
falling to the ground Sarah tries to run but the Warrior
grabs her He lifts her over his shoulder and carries her
inside the barn closing the door behind them We HEAR Sarah
SCREAM A beat Suddenly the doors of the barn crash open as
the Warrior flies out of the barn and lands on his back

Macleod steps out of the barn his Samurai in hand Warrior
2 Still mounted on his horse grins

WARRIOR 2
It appears this farmer has a temper

Warrior 1 staggers to his feet He removes his sword and
stares angrily at Macleod

WARRIOR 1
This farmer is dead

Warrior 1 lunges at Macleod who casually sidesteps his attack
and slices his sword across the Warriors chest The Warrior
GASPS then falls to the ground dead

Warrior 2 cannot believe what he has seen Anger fills his
face He reaches to the side of his saddle and lifts a CROSS
BOW Macleod changes his grip on the sword and holds it like a
spear He THROWS it at the Warrior at the same time he FIRES
the cross bow The sword flies into the Warriors stomach
Blood flows from his mouth A beat He falls from the saddle
dead
Macleod is standing an ARROW dead-center in his chest Blood
flows from the wound He slowly walks into the barn The
Farmer runs after him

INT BARN - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

The Farmer enters Macleod is on his knees his face filled
with pain He pulls the arrow from his chest and stands The
farmer cannot believe what he has just seen He crosses
himself

Outside through the open barn doors we see Sarah and her
mother running towards them The Farmer quickly closes the
doors and bolts them

FARMER
(stunned)
This cannot be

MCCLEOD
It is Do not ask me how I do not
know I must leave for if I stayed

worse than they will come

Agreed

MCCLEOD
(sadly)

The doors opens and the Farmer comes outside He motions for
his wife and Sarah to enter

INT BARN - DAY

Sarah is crying as she enters with her Mother and Father
Macleod is laying on the ground his head propped up under a
mat of straw

FARMER
Be quick -- he has not much time

Tears flow from Sarahs eyes as she kneels next to Macleod
She holds his hand
He gently

The Farmer ushers his wife and Sarah from the barn

SARAH

FARMER

He can see the LIGHTS in the

Go I will dig a grave and mark it

Macleod turns around

FARMER
I will not pretend to understand what

back into the past He opens the book of poetry and searches
through it

EXT ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS - LATE AFTERNOON

The WIND HOWLS through the valley Outside the crumbling RUINS
of the STONE BUILDING (we saw in the opening sequence) are
several four wheel drive trucks and vans PROFESSOR PAUL
DAJORSKI is a typical academic in his fifties beard glasses
pipe tweed jacket He walks across the field with a REPORTER
and CAMERAMAN

PROFESSOR DAJORSKI
For years this site was thought to
hold no archaeological value That
is until a few weeks ago when some
local boys discovered what appears to
be a collapsed passageway that leads
into a cavern

REPORTER
How much longer until you expect to
enter the main cavern

PROFESSOR DAJORSKI
Thats what were going to find out
now

A STREAK OF LIGHTNING CUTS across the clear blue sky
Professor Dajorski looks up

REPORTER
(referring to the
lightning)

bright green light oscillates up and down She looks up at

JENNIFER
Electro magnetic soundings indicate
weve only got a few inches of rock
left before we reach the main
chamber

REPORTER
Any idea how big the cavern is on the
other side

JENNIFER

JENNIFER

(to Dajorski)
Paul I thought we agreed No

going to find in there It could be
a huge excavation A little friendly
PR never hurt

JENNIFER
Where is the film crew from the
British Museum

PROFESSOR DAJORSKI
Theyve had a little car trouble

Seventeenth century England

Macleod rides his horse along a road blanketed by dense forest
on each side Suddenly he stops his horse as a premonition
fills him He looks around A horse is tethered to a tree off

Good day

The VOICE comes from above Macleod looks up Sitting on the
branch of a tree that extents over the road is THOMAS

EXT ANCIENT CHURCH - DAY

The Church stands alone in a valley its stone walls collapsed
from time and neglect Fog carpets the ground HORSES and
CARTS are in front of the building

INT ANCIENT CHURCH - DAY

Only three of the four stone walls are standing A large
section of the roof is gone Inside are about thirty MEN
WARRIORS fierce and hard-looking They stand before what once
was the altar and listen as Cavenaugh speaks

CAVANAUGH
Ive called this gathering on holy
ground so that each man might take
comfort in knowing he is protected
inside the confines of these walls
None of us good or evil would dare
raise a hand against the other in
Gods house

MAN 1
If God protects us so why has he
cursed us

CAVANAUGH
Gods purpose for us is unclear save
that he has given us a gift

MAN 2
A gift You call never growing old -
- watching friends and loved ones die
a gift

CAVANAUGH
I do not profess to know what is in
Gods mind He has chosen us We
are his warriors through time The
final Gathering is still far away but
the prize must be captured by a man
who is pure of heart Those of us
who would use the prize for goodly
purpose must band together against
those who would use it for evil

In the back of the room standing alone is Macleod His eyes
are on the altar but his mind seems far away

Macleod walks with Cavanaugh weaving through the crowd of men
and horses

MCCLEOD
The prize So much blood so that in
the end the one that remains will be
mortal again So much pain so that
the winner can grow old and have
children The prize hardly seems
worth the cost of it

CAVANAUGH
There will be more to the prize than
that Power will come with it -- and

it must be used for good

MCCLEOD
The days of magic are ending The
world is changing

CAVANAUGH
Aye -- yet one such as I who has
wandered this world for nearly nine
centuries can remember back to other
days of change Days of Robin of the
Hood and Arthur Pendragon They were
real enough once but they drifted
into mens dreams and became legend -
- as we shall do one day

Macleod stops at his horse

MCCLEOD
I grow weary of the fight

Macleod mounts his horse

CAVANAUGH
You cannot run from your destiny

against the railing staring out over the water A beat
Suddenly Macleod stiffens his gaze lifts off the water A
premonition fills him He turns around knowing what he will
find behind him

MACLEODS POV

The other Horseman approaches He holds his broad sword at his
side

Macleod holds his hand up

MCCLEOD
Wait We dont have to do this

The Horseman lunges at Macleod He raises the sword and brings
it down quickly Macleod moves quickly to his side The sword
miss him by inches as it smashes into the railing slicing
through the metal

Macleod stares into the Horsemans eyes -- they are cold
savage He knows there is not point in talking

MCCLEOD
Alright

Macleod opens his rain coat and slowly removes the ancient
Samurai sword He expertly twirls the sword as he raises it
over his head and holds it in a fighting stance A beat Both
men lock eyes The Horseman attacks

Blades cross Sparks fly The men move across the quay
towards the warehouse

The Horseman thrusts his sword Macleod steps to the side and
slices the blade of the Samurai across the Horsemans face A
deep gash appears blood flows down his cheek The Horseman
touches the wound looks at the blood on his finger then
tastes it He grins and attacks

The Horseman whirls his sword swinging furiously at Macleod
Blow after powerful blow pounds against the samurai Macleod
is backed up against the railing The swords cross and
remained locked -- each man pushing against the other in a show
of strength

The Horseman knees Macleod in the groin Macleod doubles over
The Horseman brings the butt of his sword down hard between
Macleods shoulder blades Macleod falls to his knees
dropping his sword The Horseman lifts the Samurai and throws
it behind him Macleod struggles to shake the pain from his
body as the Horseman raises the sword above Macleods neck

As he brings it down Macleod lunges forward hurling his body
into the Horseman and picking him Macleods runs across the
quay carrying the Horseman on his shoulder The Horseman
raises his sword above his head Macleod heads towards one of
the large windows of the warehouse

INT MEAT PACKING WAREHOUSE - DUSK

CRASH Glass shatters as Macleod and the Horseman break
through the window Carcasses of BEEF hang from hooks on a
curving S-HAPED processing line Slowly the two warriors get
to their feet The Horsemans sword is a few feet behind him
He stands and walks to it Macleod looks around the room
looking for something -- anything -- that might be used as a
weapon

The Horseman attacks swinging his sword wildly Macleod grabs
the racks of beef using them as a shield The Horsemans
blade slices through the meat Macleod back up grabs another
side of beef and pushes it into the Horseman The impact
knocks the Horseman to the ground His sword slides across the
floor The Horseman gets up and walks over to his sword

Macleod grabs one of the MEAT HOOKS and hurls it towards the
Horsemans back The Horseman has just about reached the sword
when the Hook spears him between the shoulder blades

Macleod pushes a RED BUTTON The processing line begins to
move -- the hook lifts picking the Horseman off the ground
The Horseman tries desperately to reach the hook but he
cannot Macleod picks up the sword and readies himself The
Horseman heads back towards Macleod In one fluid motion
Macleod cuts off his head -- leaving the rope intact The
headless body continues to swing across the room

A beat Macleod readies himself for what he knows his coming
Sparks of green light begin to pulse out from the Horsemans
headless body

Macleods body stiffens as a jolt of power fills him Overhead
LIGHT FIXTURES CRACKLE as the LIGHT BULBS begin to glow The
ENGINE of an old fork lift comes to life A RADIO turns on
filling the room with MUSIC

JENNIFER
My name is Jennifer Hillman I was

JENNIFER
I was wondering if I could talk to
you

MCCLEOD

Are you a cop

JENNIFER
No Im an archaeologist

MCCLEOD
What do you want

JENNIFER
To talk to you

MCCLEOD
I dont think we have anything to

MCCLEOD
Corpses

JENNIFER
Yes We found another man outside a
site we were working at in Scotland

MCCLEOD
In the highlands

JENNIFER
Yes How did you know

MCCLEOD
A lucky guess

JENNIFER
I dont think so -- but then maybe
youve can guess how a guy with a
sword could rob the First national
Bank this afternoon -- and get shot
six times in the chest by the guard
and still get up and walk out

MCCLEOD
He was wearing a bullet proof vest

JENNIFER
Bullet proof vests dont bleed

MCCLEOD
(shrugs his shoulder)
You got me

JENNIFER
Why do I feel that you know whats
going on

MCCLEOD
Are you the type of person who takes

advice Miss Hillman

JENNIFER
If its good advice

MCCLEOD

JENNIFER

Why Whats going on

Macleod shows a hint of frustration that she isnt going to
take his advice Macleod starts to walks away Jennifer grabs
his arm Macleod turns around and pulls her hand away
Suddenly his expression changes as he stares at her hand

MACLEODS POV

On her finger is a distinctive RING It is very old intricate
gold patterns carved in gold and set in ivory

Macleod is shocked He slowly raises her hand up before his
face and looks her in the eyes

MCCLEOD
Where did you get this ring

Jennifer is more than a little frightened by Macleod intensity

MCCLEOD
(continuing)
Where did you get it

JENNIFER
Its mine Its been in my family
for years It belonged to my great
great great grandmother

Macleod stares at the ring again -- his mind drifts away for a
moment then he looks at Jennifer

MCCLEOD
Goodnight Miss Hillman

Macleod walks towards the elevator A beat Jennifer gathers
her composure -- in spite of his intensity there is something
that interests her about Macleod Macleod steps in the
elevator and looks back at her He says nothing The elevator
doors close Jennifer stares after him intrigued

Something catches Macleods eye

MACLEODS POV
Across the room standing with a group of pompous-looking MEN

Macleod

CAVANAUGH

So you do this for yourself What

(beat)
You cannot not have a relationship
Macleod Youve told me of your
wife Heather and how you loved her
Romeriz warned you then but you
would not listen You watched her
grow old and die -- and there was
nothing you could do

A sadness falls over Macleod as he remembers
over to him and puts his arm on his shoulder

CAVANAUGH
(continuing)
That was two hundred and fifty years
ago -- and the pain still scars your
heart Would you live that pain
again
MCCLEOD

end it

MCCLEOD
Where Im going you cannot follow

ISABELLE
(on the verge of
tears)
Why are you doing this

MCCLEOD
Because its for the best There

unexplained

Macleod takes a ring off his finger IT IS THE SAME RING
JENNIFER WAS WEARING He gently slips on Isabelles finger

MCCLEOD
Take this -- and whenever you look at
it remember that it came from one
who loved you

He kisses her forehead gently then starts to leave
ISABELLE
I wanted to grow old with you -- to
have your children
Macleod turns back to her and smiles sadly
MCCLEOD

him The instant the COP passes Macleod he turns and removes
a SWORD from under his jacket

just as the sword comes streaking at his head Macleod side-
steps the attack the blade slices across his forearm a stripe
of BLOOD appears on his arm Macleod quickly removes his
Samurai from under his jacket

The cop studies him for a moment then begins to LAUGH A

just witnessed

Kilvara smiles at Macleod his eyes alive with hatred

MCCLEOD
Why did you wait

KILVARA

It was not by choice A small matter
of a mountain falling down on us We
were trapped inside

(serious)
When the time of the Gathering came
the urge to go was so strong we tried
to claw through rock with our bare
hands What you thought was the end
-- was not This is the end We are
the last of our kind Macleod

MCCLEOD
It will not end tonight

KILVARA
You cannot hide from me You will
not stand between me and my destiny

struggling with a PROSTITUTE He grabs her roughly and pins
her against the wall From inside his overcoat he slowly
removes a long sword He holds the tip of the blade up before
her eyes

PROSTITUTE

This seems to please the man

He smiles -- then just as quickly his smile fades He appears
to sense something He turns around to see

The Man stares at Macleod then smiles -- a wild crazy smile
MAN
(English accent)

MAN

Im afraid I cant do that Just let
me kill her and then we can attend to

Macleod takes a few steps closer He is now almost is striking
range He slowly slides his Samurai out of the walking stick

MCCLEOD
When you make your thrust at her Ill
take your head Its her or me

MAN
Oh dear me -- I do so hate decisions

The man realizes that Macleod is right He reluctantly lets
her go The prostitute runs from the alley A beat The two
men stare at each other -- then the Man lunges at Macleod
swinging his sword furiously Sparks fly as sword cross

gruesome sight his eyes filled with horror

Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your
theory

JENNIFER
No

MCCLEOD
Why not

JENNIFER
Because I dont feel like sitting in
a rubber room for forty-eight hours

MCCLEOD
You dont really believe this do you

JENNIFER

(sidesteps the

question)
Let me ask you something else At
the excavation site in Scotland the
tunnel leading into the cavern had
collapsed The day we found the body
someone had moved the rocks making a
hole in the collapsed section What
bothers me is that we found the rocks
from the hole on our side of the
tunnel wall

MCCLEOD
So

JENNIFER
Why would someone pull on the rocks
to get in the cavern They were
wedged in tight They couldnt get a
grip on them They would have had
much more strength pushing on them

MCCLEOD
If they pushed the rocks you would
have found them on the other side of
the cavern wall

JENNIFER
Yes -- if they were trying to get in
-- but what if they werent What if
they were trying to get out

A beat Macleod isnt sure how much she knows -- but he knows
she is close

MCCLEOD
That would mean theyd been trapped
in there--

JENNIFER
--for three hundred years
MCCLEOD
How could that be People dont live

for three hundred years

JENNIFER
Not unless theyre immortal

Their eyes lock Macleod studies her He knows she knows -
or at least suspects Jennifer smiles warmly she places her

hand on Macleod arm -- then quickly tears the BANDAGE of his
arm

HER POV - OF MACLEODS ARM
There is no trace of the cut No scar -- nothing

Jennifer looks back at Macleod astonished Macleod slowly
peels her hand off his arm His eyes stare deeply into hers

MCCLEOD
Youre very smart for someone who has
not even lived a single lifetime
Maybe too smart

Macleod gets up and leaves Jennifer follows

EXT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Macleod walks down the street Jennifer runs after him She
grabs him by the stop He stops

JENNIFER
What did you mean a single lifetime

Are you saying that its true

Macleod says nothing He stares at her for a moment then
walks off

CUT TO

EXT CITY STREET - NIGHT

Empty Macleod walks along the pavement his mind deep in
thought

CUT TO

EXT JENNIFERS APARTMENT FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
Jennifer opens the door She is surprised to see Macleod A
beat

MCCLEOD
May I come in

Jennifer opens the door wider Macleod walks inside

INT JENNIFERS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Macleod walks to the middle of the room He is struggling with
himself inside himself

MCCLEOD
You asked me earlier if that ring
meant something to me -- it does It
reminds me of someone I knew a long
time ago

Jennifer starts to take it off her finger

JENNIFER
Would you like to see it

MCCLEOD
Ive seen it

JENNIFER
On the back it has--

MCCLEOD
--the crest of a lion and a dragon
and a single word Courage

JENNIFER
How did you know that

Macleod away -- his mind drifts as he speaks

MCCLEOD
It came from your great great great
grandmother Isabelle Tourez who
lived in Paris and died on the
guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and
unmarried The ring was given to her
by someone who loved her -- but knew
that it could never be

JENNIFER
You

Macleod looks at her his eyes staring deeply into hers
MCCLEOD
Yes

Now that she has heard what she suspected a look of doubt
crosses her face Macleod notices it

MCCLEOD
I was born into the clan Macleod
five hundred years ago in Glenfinnan
-- on the shores of Loch Shiel

Jennifer stares at him -- there is doubt in her eyes
Suspecting and believing are two different things and her
expression relays her skepticism Macleod picks up a DAGGER on
the worktable and holds it before his heart

MCCLEOD
Ive wandered the world ever since
then I cannot die

She tries to stop him but before she can Macleod thrusts the
dagger into his chest His face fills with pain -- he drops to
his knees Jennifer watches in horror A beat Macleod looks
up at her then pulls the dagger from his chest Jennifer is
overwhelmed with astonishment She slowly drops to her knees
They are inches from each other

MCCLEOD
(weakly)

You wanted the truth -- now you have
it

JENNIFER
And the other one -- he is like you

MCCLEOD
He is immortal -- yes -- but he is
not like me We are the last of our
kind

(he looks at her)
The last of the Calans I do not
know what purpose we were put here
for I only know that if he wins the
world will suffer for it

Macleod starts to stand Jennifer gently places her hand on
his shoulder

JENNIFER
Where will you go now

MCCLEOD
It will end tonight
JENNIFER
Must you fight him

MCCLEOD
He will not stop until it is over

Jennifer stares deeply into his eyes She moves closer and
then gently kisses him They search each others eyes She
leans in to kiss him again Macleod pulls away She starts to
say something he gently puts his finger over her lips and
stares at her fondly -- then leaves

CUT TO

EXT NASH ANTIQUES - NIGHT

Macleod walks down the street towards the shop Suddenly from
out of a doorway Bedsoe appears

MCCLEOD
Good evening Lieutenant

BEDSOE
No -- it isnt A cop died today and
the other is barely holding on I

MCCLEOD
Im sorry about that -- but I had
nothing to do with it

BEDSOE
That doesnt mean you dont know
whats going on Youre connected to
this guy somehow Hes after you --
just like the others were

MCCLEOD
(looks at his watch)
Its late

Macleod starts to leave Bedsoe grabs him by the neck and
slams him into the wall then holds his GUN to Macleods face
A beat Macleod stares at him calmly

BEDSOE
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy
He said he saw two men fighting in an
alley with swords One cut off the
others head He shot the surviving
guy twenty times and he got right
back up and stabbed him
MCCLEOD
Maybe he was a lousy shot

Bedsoe anger fills Bedsoes face He slowly pulls back the
HAMMER of his pistol A beat He studies Macleod for a
reaction There isnt one

BEDSOE
Most people would show some sign of
fear with a gun in their face

MCCLEOD
Most people are afraid of death

BEDSOE
Most people can die

A beat Their eyes are locked on each others probing
studying evaluating

MCCLEOD
If you really believe that youll
pull the trigger

Bedsoe struggles within himself The gun shakes in his hand
A beat Slowly he lowers the pistol Macleod walks inside

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Macleod sits on the couch staring into the darkness His mind
races filled with thoughts and decisions He sharpens the
blade of his Samurai The PHONE RINGS Macleod answers it

KILVARAS VOICE
Can you come out and play

Macleod doesnt answer

KILVARAS VOICE

No You know some people think that
I dont have any good qualities but
that isnt true I saw you tonight
with your little friend -- I let you
say goodbye to her I think of it as
letting a condemned prisoner have his
last request Besides I have her
now

MCCLEOD
She isnt part of this
KILVARAS VOICE

figured wed have more room for our
business here If you hurry you

Pain fills Jennifers face A beat Slowly she smiles as a
TRANSFORMATION begins The image of Jennifer is replaced with

that of Kilvara Macleod smiles at him

MCCLEOD

Macleod swings his blade at Kilvaras neck Kilvara ducks them

Bedsoe reaches the front door He tries to break it open but

CUT TO

INT MUSEUM MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

Macleod moves slowly through the work tables waiting
watching listening Something catches his attention
MACLEODS POV

Jennifer is gagged and tied to a chair which has been placed on
top of a long table Another chair has been placed about three
feet away from her on the table On the second chair a
CROSSBOW has been mounted and aimed at Jennifer A ROPE is
tied to the TRIGGER and stretched to her chair A WEIGHT has
been tied in the center of the rope A CANDLE burns behind the
WEIGHT When it burns though the rope the WEIGHT will fall and
the CROSSBOW will fire at Jennifer

Kilvara steps out of the shadows a wicked grin on his face

KILVARA
Clever -- dont you think You can
save her All you have to do is blow
out the candle Of course you have
to get past me to do it

The rope is beginning to turn black as the candle burns deeper
into it Macleod knows he has little time before the ropes
snaps He moves towards her Kilvara blocks his path

KILVARA
Now you die

Kilvara swings his sword at Macleod Macleod blocks the
attack Kilvara kicks him in the stomach doubling him over
and driving him back Kilvara wields his sword powerfully
Macleod side-steps the attack -- Kilvaras blade slams into a
table slicing it cleanly in half

Jennifer struggles in her chair her eyes open wide in horror
staring at the candle

sword furiously and relentlessly at Macleod Macleod jumps up
on a table Kilvara swings his blade at Macleods knees
Macleod jumps the blade sails under his feet when he lands he
KICKS Kilvara in the face knocking him to the ground
Kilvaras sword slides across the floor Macleod looks at
Kilvara then across the room He has only a second to decide
Kilvara or Jennifer

MACLEODS POV

The ROPE is about to snap -- strands are staring to fray

Macleod runs across the tabletop and jumps onto another as he
heads for the long table across the room

Kilvara stands -- picks up his sword and runs after Macleod

More strands of the rope snap as the flame burns deeper in the
rope It is just about to when

Macleod runs onto the long table He dives and slides across
it -- his Samurai extended in front of him

The rope SNAPS The WEIGHT begins to fall

Macleod drives the blade of his sword through the trigger
housing The WEIGHT pulls on the rope -- but the blade of the
Samurai blocks the trigger from pulling back

Kilvara reaches Macleod Their eyes meet Macleod knows he
cannot removes his sword to defend himself or the crossbow will
fire Kilvara raises his sword and is about to strike when a
SHOT is FIRED

Bedsoe is standing in the doorway his gun aimed at Kilvara

BEDSOE
(to Kilvara)
You
KILVARA
I know -- freeze

A beat Kilvara looks at Bedsoe then at Macleod He is only
a few feet away He thinks -- then lunges at Macleod

Bedsoe fires two shots They hit Kilvara in the chest He
drops to the ground

Macleod unties Jennifer quickly Bedsoe moves across the room
towards them He carefully passes the motionless body of
Kilvara

MCCLEOD
Bedsoe -- he isnt dead

Too late Kilvara stands grabbing Bedsoe guns hand He
smashes it against the wall The GUN flies out of Bedsoes
hand and slides across the floor Kilvara effortlessly lifts
him off the ground and throws him against the wall Bedsoe
hist the floor hard his face etched in pain from several
broken bones Jennifer runs over to him

Kilvara picks up his sword and moves towards Macleod

KILVARA
Now -- we finish it

Macleod stares at him confidently

MCCLEOD
Yes

Macleod quickly spins the chair with the CROSSBOW around so it
is facing Kilvara He removes his Samurai The trigger snaps
bac

WHOOSH The ARROW hits Kilvara in the chest Pain fills his
face

Macleod runs towards him Kilvara pulls the arrow from his
chest and manages to raises his sword just in time to block
Macleods attack Through the room they battle Macleod
fights fiercely backing Kilvara up

Jennifer makes Bedsoe more comfortable by propping him against
the wall She looks around the room

JENNIFERS POV

of Bedsoes gun on the floor

Jennifer rushes over to it and picks it up She aims it at
Kilvara

Kilvara sees her with the gun He knows that if she shoots him
he would be stunned along enough for Macleod to take his head

Jennifer FIRES a SHOT It misses -- the bullet hits the wall
Kilvara swings his sword powerfully at one of the WOODEN
PILLARS His blade slices through it Part of the ROOF
collapses

DUST fills the room SILENCE Jennifer slowly moves forward
trying to see through it The dust clears She stops --
stunned and confused by what she sees

JENNIFERS POV

Standing in the middle of the room are TWO MACLEODS
Jennifer moves the gun back and forth between each of them
noting knowing which is the real Macleod

Both Macleods look at each other They lunges at each other
and the battle begins again

Jennifer can only watch helplessly

Through the room they fight -- both Macleods swinging their
swords at the other -- their swords cross -- sparks fly They
move through the room -- fighting fiercely

One of the Macleods swings his sword -- it slices through the
other arm The other Macleods drops his sword The first
Macleod raises his sword

MCCLEOD
There can be only one

He swings the sword slicing it across the other Macleods
neck A beat Out the gash come a brilliant GREEN LIGHT --
then the transformation begins The image of Macleod fades and
is replaced by Kilvara He stares at Macleod tries to smile
but falls to the floor and dies

A beat Macleod readies himself The place explodes in a
burst of GREEN LIGHT Windows explode overhead lights flash
on and off then blow up

Jennifer and Bedsoe shield their eyes from the brilliant
spectacle

Macleods body pulses with pain as Kilvaras power flows into
him

SILENCE Macleod drops to his knees Jennifer rushes over to
him and helps him to his feet

JENNIFER
Is it over

For a moment it is as if he didnt hear the question then
slowly he looks at her He picks up his Samurai and slowly
slices the blade into the palm of his hand A cut appears A
beat It does not heal Macleod looks at her with a trace of
grin

MCCLEOD
Yes -- I think it is
BEDSOE
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand
