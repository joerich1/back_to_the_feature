I can deal with it if I want to
Its just that Ive had it ever
since I was a baby and and
I find it very comforting
HE KISSES IT AND SHOVES IT INTO HIS POCKET

BIALYSTOCK
(to himself)
They come here They all come here

BLOOM
(recovering his dignity)
Mr Bialystock

BIALYSTOCK
Yes Prince Mishkin what can we do
for you

BLOOM

This is hardly a time for levity
Ive discovered a serious error
here in the accounts of your last
play

BIALYSTOCK MOVES AROUND THE DESK TO EXAMINE THE LEDGER

BIALYSTOCK
Where What

BLOOM
According to the backers list you
raised 60000 But the show you
produced only cost fifty-eight
thousand Theres two thousand
dollars unaccounted for

BIALYSTOCK
I went to a Turkish bath who cares
The show was a flop What
difference does it make

BLOOM
It makes a great deal of difference
Thats fraud If they found out
you could go to prison

BIALYSTOCK
Why should they find out Its
only two thousand dollars Bloom
do me a favor move a few decimal
points around You can do it
Youre an accountant The word
‘count is part of your title

BLOOM
(aghast)
But thats cheating

BIALYSTOCK
Its not cheating Its charity
Bloom look at me look at me

Im drowning Other men sail
through life Bialystock has
struck a reef Bloom Im going
under I am being sunk by a
society that demands success when
all I can offer is failure Bloom
Im reaching out to you Dont
send me to jail Help Help

DURING BIALYSTOCKS LAST SPEECH BLOOM UNCONSCIOUSLY REACHES
INTO HIS POCKET TAKES OUT THE BLUE BLANKET AND RUBS IT
ACROSS HIS CHEEK

BLOOM

BIALYSTOCK

Nothing Nothing Do it Do it
BLOOM
(pouring over the accounts)

department of internal revenue
isnt interested in a show that

flopped

BIALYSTOCK

)

Wake me if theres a fire

HE HURLS HIMSELF DOWN ONTO THE COUCH

CAMERA MOVES IN TO TIGHT SHOT OF BLOOM

BLOOM

Now lets see if we add these

figures we get

CAMERA MOVES INTO CLOSE-UP OF BLOOMS FINGER SWIFTLY MOVING
DOWN LONG COLUMN OF FIGURES HE COMES TO THE END AND

IMMEDIATELY WRITHES TOTAL BELOW

BACK TO TIGHT SHOT OF BLOOM HE COMPARES PAGES

BLOOM
(musing to himself)
Heh heh heh amazing

Its

absolutely amazing But under the
right circumstances a producer
could make more money with a flop

than he could with a hit

QUICK CUT TO BIALYSTOCKS SLEEPING FACE

CUT BACK TO BLOOM

BLOOM

Yes Yes Its quite possible
If he were certain the show would
fail a man could make a fortune

HIS EYES POP OPEN
CUT TO BIALYSTOCK BY NOW HE IS HALFWAY ACROSS THE ROOM
HIS WHOLE BEING TINGLING WITH ALERTNESS HE MOVES TO
BLOOMS DESK AND HOVERS OVER HIM WAITING EXPECTANTLY FOR
MORE INFORMATION BUT BLOOM IS LOST IN HIS WORK UNAWARE
THAT BIALYSTOCK IS HANGING ON HIS EVERY WORD

BIALYSTOCK
Yes

BLOOM LOOKS UP HE IS STARTLED TO SEE BIALYSTOCKS FACE SO
CLOSE TO HIS OWN

BLOOM
(at a loss)
Yes what

BIALYSTOCK
What you were saying Keep talking

BLOOM
What was I saying

BIALYSTOCK
You were saying that under the
right circumstances a producer
could make more money with a flop
than he could with a hit

BLOOM
(smiling)
Yes its quite possible

BIALYSTOCK
You keep saying that but you dont
tell me how How could a producer
make more money with a flop than
with a hit

BLOOM SLIGHTLY EXASPERATED PUTS HIS PENCIL DOWN AND FACES
BIALYSTOCK HE SPEAKS TO BIALYSTOCK AS A TEACHER WOULD A
STUDENT

BLOOM
Its simply a matter of creative
accounting Let us assume just
for the moment that you are a
dishonest man

BIALYSTOCK
Assume away

BLOOM
Well its very easy You simply
raise more money than you really
need

BIALYSTOCK
What do you mean

BLOOM
Youve done it yourself only you
did it on a very small scale

BIALYSTOCK
What did I do

BLOOM
You raised two thousand more than

you needed to produce your last play

BIALYSTOCK
So what What did it get me Im
wearing a cardboard belt

BLOOM
Ahhhhhh But thats where you made
your error You didnt go all the
way You see if you were really a
bold criminal you could have
raised a million

BIALYSTOCK
But the play only cost 60000 to
produce

BLOOM
Exactly And how long did it run

BIALYSTOCK
One night

BLOOM
See You could have raised a
million dollars put on a sixty
thousand dollar flop and kept the
rest

BIALYSTOCK
But what if the play was a hit

BLOOM
Oh youd go to jail If the play
were a hit youd have to pay off
the backers and with so many
backers there could never be enough
profits to go around get it

BIALYSTOCK
Aha aha aha aha aha aha So
in order for the scheme to work
wed have to find a sure fire flop

BLOOM
What scheme

BIALYSTOCK
What scheme Your scheme you
bloody little genius

BLOOM
Oh no No No I meant no
scheme I merely posed a little
academic accounting theory Its
just a thought

BIALYSTOCK
Bloom worlds are turned on such
thoughts

BIALYSTOCK STARTS MOVING IN ON BLOOM

BIALYSTOCK
Dont you see Bloom Darling
Bloom glorious Bloom its so
simple Step one We find the

worst play in the world -- a sure
flop Step two I raise a million
dollars -- theres a lot of little

old ladies in this world Step
three You go back to work on the
books Phoney lists of backers --
one for the government one for us
You can do it Bloom youre a
wizard

(MORE)

BIALYSTOCK (CONTD)
Step four We open on Broadway and
before you can say step five we
close on Broadway Step six We
take our million dollars and fly to
Rio de Janiero

BIALYSTOCK GRABS BLOOM IN HIS ARMS AND BEGINS TO LEAD HIM IN
A WILD TANGO AROUND THE ROOM

BIALYSTOCK
(sings)
Ah Rio Rio by the seao meo
myo meo

BLOOM
(afraid of the
scheme afraid of the
dance afraid of Bialystock)
Mr Bialystock No Wait Please
Youre holding me too tight Im
an honest man You dont understand

BIALYSTOCK
(leading Bloom as he talks)
No Bloom you dont understand
This is fate this is destiny
Theres no avoiding it

AT THIS POINT BIALYSTOCK SWEEPS BLOOM INTO AN ELABORATE DIP

BLOOM

(the back of his head

practically touching

the floor)
Mr Bialystock not more than five
minutes ago against my better
judgment I doctored your books
That sir is the ultimate extent
of my criminal life
BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS FISTS TO THE HEAVENS IN DESPAIR

BLOOM EXPERIENCING A DEFINITE LACK OF SUPPORT

to make himself more comfortable)

BIALYSTOCK

(angrily hovering

over Bloom)
You miserable cowardly wretched
little caterpillar Dont you ever
want to become a butterfly Dont
you want to spread your wings and
flap your way to glory

BIALYSTOCK FLAPS HIS ARMS LIKE A HUGE PREDATORY BIRD

BLOOM
(his eyes widened in terror)
Youre going to jump on me

BIALYSTOCK STARES AT HIM INCREDULOUSLY

BLOOM
Youre going to jump on me I know
youre going to jump on me -- like

Nero jumped on Poppea

BIALYSTOCK
(nonplussed)

BLOOM
(by now he is shrieking)
Poppea She was his wife And she
was unfaithful to him So he got
mad and he jumped on her Up and
down up and down until he squashed
her like a bug Please dont jump

BIALYSTOCK
(shouting and jumping
up and down next to Bloom)
Im not going to jump on you

BLOOM
(rolling away in terror)
Aaaaaaaaaa

BIALYSTOCK
(hoisting Bloom to
his feet)
Will you get a hold on yourself

BLOOM
(up on his feet and
running for cover)
Dont touch me Dont touch me

HE RUNS TO A CORNER OF THE ROOM TRAPPED HE TURNS

BIALYSTOCK
What are you afraid of Im not
going to hurt you Whats the
matter with you

BLOOM

BIALYSTOCK RUSHES TO THE DESK PICKS UP A CARAFE OF WATER
AND SHOSHES ITS CONTENTS INTO BLOOMS FACE

BLOOM

BIALYSTOCK IN A DESPERATE MOVE TO STOP BLOOMS HYSTERICS
SLAPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE

BLOOM
(holding his face)
Im in pain And Im wet And Im

BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS HAND AGAIN

BLOOM
No No Dont hit It doesnt
help It only increases my sense
of danger

BIALYSTOCK
What can I do What can I do

BLOOM

Sit over there

BIALYSTOCK SITS ON THE SOFA

BIALYSTOCK
