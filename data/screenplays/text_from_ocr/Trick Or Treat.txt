BLACKNESS

Pierced by flickering candlelight It grows brighter until
the orange scowl of a JACK O’LANTERN fills the frame

WIDER to reveal the jack o’lantern sits at the foot of a
home‘s FRONT GATE An identical pumpkin is next to it

EXT SIDEWALK - FRONT GATE - NIGHT

A YOUNG COUPLE approaches the gate EMMA is dressed as The
Bride of Frankenstein while her husband HENRY is a mad
doctor They laugh and stumble down the sidewalk a little
drunk from the night’s festivities Emma bends over to blow
out the jack o’lanterns but Henry stops her

HENRY
Whoa Not yet

EMMA
What

HENRY

Its one of the rules You need to
keep them lit

She rolls her eyes checks her watch smiles a drunken smile

EMMA
I’m lit You’re lit But our friends
here

Emma blows out the jack o’lanterns

EMMA (contd)
--their night is over

SOMEONES POV

Watching from across the street half hidden behind a tree
Watching as Emma kisses Henry on the cheek

HENRY
You’re asking for it

EMMA
Oh I am

Emma grabs his ass He yelps as they stroll up the walkway
toward the front porch Their average suburban home is new
and pristine sporting a fresh coat of BRIGHT YELLOW PAINT
It is also covered in HALLOWEEN DECORATIONS skeletons hang
in the trees coffins and fake severed limbs are scattered
across the lawn
32103 TRICK OR TREAT Michael Dougherty 2

SCARY SOUND EFFECTS play from speakers set up in the windows
A DOZEN GHOSTS made from old sheets are propped up on wooden
crosses around the yard Someone really loves the holiday

THE POV MOVES

It keeps low scurrying across the street to the front gate
It focuses on the unlit jack o‘lanterns then drifts to Henry
and Emma on the porch They step inside the house and shut
the door

THE POV MOVES
EXT HOUSE FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

Darting into the yard leaping over coffins under ghosts--
we hear panting and little footsteps as it runs It finally
stops at A LIVING ROOM WINDOW

THROUGH THE LIVING ROOM WINDOW the stalker watches listening
to the couple talk barely audible over the screams and howls
of the sound effects tape Henry tugs at Emma‘s dress

HENRY
Come play doctor

EMMA
After I take them down

HENRY
You can take them down in the morning

EMMA
It looks like a crime scene out there
and my mother will be here in the
morning She’1ll have a coronary

HENRY
So well just make her one of the
decorations There are plenty of
coffins
She playfully smacks him
EMMA
Go get undressed I’‘ll let you doa
full exam later
Henry whines a little then kisses her and mopes upstairs
THE POV ENDS drifting away from the window

EXT HOUSE FRONT PORCH — NIGHT

The door opens and Emma steps onto the porch She grabs a
piece of candy from a nearby bowl then stares at the
decorated yard She sighs This is going to be a long night
INT HOUSE UPSTAIRS

Henry stumbles down the dark hall He’s about to walk into
the bedroom when EERIE LAUGHTER echoes through the house He
listens slightly alarmed

HENRY
Emma

The laughter stops replaced by RATTLING CHAINS He realizes
it’s just the sound effects tape and smiles

EXT HOUSE FRONT YARD

CLOSE ON A SEVERED ARM sitting in a pile of leaves

Emma reaches down and picks it up tosses it into a box
already half full of other decorations She almost trips over

a skeleton

EMMA
Shit

Emma walks between the ghosts their white sheets blowing in
the wind Grabbing one sheet she yanks it off and tosses it
into the box revealing the wooden cross underneath and a
round head made from a flour sack

TRICK OR TREATERS run by the house Emma watches them and
smiles when something else catches her attention

ACROSS THE STREET

A TALL FIGURE is standing under a tree wearing a red robe
and a DEVIL MASK- staring at her

IN THE FRONT YARD

Emma continues pulling down the ghosts and putting them in
her bag but she’s becoming uneasy She glances at the Devil
never taking her eyes off of him

ACROSS THE STREET

The Devil is still watching Beat
32103 TRICK OR TREAT Michael Dougherty 4

A CAR filled with teenagers pulls up and honks The passenger
door opens and MUSIC BLARES The Devil climbs inside the car

IN THE FRONT YARD

Emma watches the car drive off She sighs slightly relieved
The street is now dead quiet No sign of anyone

EMMA (cont‘d)
(to herself)
Trick or treat

She walks up to another ghost about to pull off its sheet--
THE GHOST LUNGES AND WRAPS ITS ARMS AROUND EMMA

It envelops her wrapping its arms tight around her face
keeping her from screaming smothering her Emma struggles
but it wont let go

She looks up at the house- a light is on in the bedroom
Finally pulling the ghost’s arms away for a moment she lets
out a loud SCREAM

INT HOUSE BEDROOM

Henry is sprawled on the bed passed out Hearing Emma’s
screams outside his eyes flutter open but her cries blend
with the shrieks and wails of the sound effects He grins and
goes back to sleep

EXT HOUSE FRONT YARD

THE GHOST PULLS EMMA CLOSE and she sees that it’s holding A
PUMPKIN LOLLIPOP with a large bite taken out so that it now
has a very sharp edge

He presses it against her neck and in one fluid motion
SLICES EMMA’S THROAT She gags Blood spurts soaking into
her dress

INT HOUSE BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

THUD Henry’s eyes slam open staring at the ceiling It
sounds like something heavy just fell on the roof

Baffled he stares at the ceiling following the sound of
tiny footsteps on the ceiling and a childlike GIGGLE

EXT HOUSE FRONT YARD

Henry walks out of the house and into the yard
32103 TRICK OR TREAT Michael Dougherty 5

HENRY
Emma

There’s no sign of her but a CROWD OF PEOPLE is gathering on
the sidewalk staring at his house in stunned silence A
mother covers her son’s eyes

Henry turns around to see what they’re gawking at He squints
to get a better look

ON THE ROOF

A COFFIN sits upright propped up by plastic skeletons posed
around it like morbid cherubs Inside is Emma’s corpse
wrapped in pumpkin vines and orange lights Her long white
dress is soaked red with blood that steadily drips like a
fountain flowing into the storm pipes

A JACK O’LANTERN rests on her shoulders One of the two she
blew out earlier

CLOSER ON THE JACK O’LANTERN Behind the triangle eyes and
wicked grin is EMMA’S FACE frozen in terror She has been
turned into a halloween decoration a horrifying yet eerily
beautiful work of art

IN THE YARD
Henry stares at the sight baffledfear slowly sinking in

CLOSE ON THE OTHER UNLIT JACK O‘LANTERN sitting in front of
the gate POP HISS A match is lit A child’s small hand
sticky with blood reaches in and relights the candle

The Jack O’Lantern’s eerie scowl once again glows to life
FADE OUT
EXT KREEG HOUSE - SUNSET

To neighborhood children this is the classic suburban haunted
house To adults it’s just an eye sore Bright yellow paint
is now cracked and faded The overgrown yard is surrounded by
a rusty iron fence and unlike the homes to either side of
it there are no pumpkins on the porch and no Halloween
decorations in the windows Leaves cover everything in sight
with more falling from the trees like rain

And just barely visible in a ground floor window is the
SILHOUETTE OF A MAN peering out from behind a curtain
32103 TRICK OR TREAT Michael Dougherty 6

A KID ON A BIKE rides by the house A BLOODY SHEET pulled
over him like a ghost This is thirteen year-old BRANDON
SNIDER

We follow him as he speeds down the tree-lined street the
sheet fluttering behind him A BROWN PAPER LUNCH BAG dangles
from one hand

EXT SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS

Brandon speeds by one suburban home after another Each one
is just a slight variation on the same model-- a different
shade of paint here a different mailbox there but all are
decorated for Halloween

Brandon pedals faster racing up a hill He reaches the top
and from there we see

A SMALL TOWN far below surrounded by more quaint homes Its
MAIN STREET bustles with activity A VAST FOREST surrounds
everything filled with fiery autumn trees stretching as far
as the eye can see

SUPER TITLE SHARON WOODS OHIO

Brandon picks up speed as he races downhill towards town
passing groups of kids on their way home from school

On the sidewalk a young boy named BILLY pokes at a DEAD BIRD
with a stick then picks it up and chases a group of
screaming girls with it

Brandon shakes his head and laughs watching the girls flee
in terror-- but NOT watching where he’s going He looks back
at the street and

A WOMAN IN A RED COAT is crossing the street in front of him

BRANDON
OH FU-

SCREEEECH Brandon hits his brakes but he’s still skidding
straight for her He shuts his eyes tight waiting for the
impact still screeching toward the unsuspecting woman

EXT MAIN STREET - INTERSECTION

Brandon opens his eyes shaking He stopped

--right in the middle of an intersection on MAIN STREET He
looks up and gawks at the woman in the red coat which we now

see is a RED RIDING HOOD costume He was just inches from
hitting her She smiles
32103 TRICK OR TREAT Michael Dougherty 7

LORI
Try to be more careful or we‘’1ll both
wind up as ghosts tonight

BRANDON
Uhhhummm

This is LORI KLINE early 20s with girl-next-door looks mixed
with big city flare Her revealing costume is complete with
pigtails picnic basket and a very small skirt Brandon
gawks speechless She smiles and walks away and as she
leaves WE FOLLOW HER

EXT MAIN STREET HARDWARE STORE

Lori stops in front of a HARDWARE STORE looking a little
lost She opens her basket and takes out a small envelope

HANDWRITTEN ON THE ENVELOPE “You have been summoned”

INSIDE THE CARD “To the annual Howl-a-Ween Bash Sharon
Woods Ohio October 31st BYOB” A CRUDE MAP is drawn on the
other side of the card

Lori frowns and starts walking again still trying to figure
out the map when she BUMPS INTO A MAN Grocery bags fall from
his arms spilling APPLES and CANDY across the sidewalk

LORI
Oh God I’m so sorry

They both kneel down and as they reach for the same apple
Lori finally makes eye contact with

STEVEN PIERCE Early 30s handsome but a little nerdy He
wears a plain brown tie white dress shirt and khakis making
him look like any other cubicle dweller who just clocked out
He stares at Lori enthralled

STEVEN
No no my fault I was
(smiles)
distracted

Lori hands him a few more of his apples and a bag of caramel

STEVEN (contd)
Youre not from around here are you

LORI
Does it show
32103 TRICK OR TREAT Michael Dougherty 8

STEVEN
A little
(eyes her outfit)
but not nearly enough

Lori is getting slightly uncomfortable with his staring

LORI
Yeah just here for a little party

STEVEN
(trying to be hip)
Oh sure I love a good rage

LORI
Rave

STEVEN
Right

An awkward beat She hands him one last apple

LORI
Welluhhagain sorry about that

STEVEN
No worries Happy Halloween

Lori smiles politely then turns and walks off She grimaces
and lets out a relieved sigh

Steven watches her leave Intensely He gets one last good
look then turns and enters the HARDWARE STORE Just as the
door shuts

A BUS WIPES FRAME and we follow it as it heads down Main
Street past more stores and people in costume

INT BUS

A WEREWOLF MASK sits on the lap of ADRIAN MILLER 16 scruffy
but good looking The kid your mother warned you about He
glances out the window while gluing plastic claws to his
fingers He almost looks like a girl doing her nails

ACROSS THE AISLE A HOT YOUNG COUPLE whispers to each other
snickering at Adrian SAMANTHA and JEFF are both in their mid
20s Adrian hears their remarks and tries to look cool--
while doing his nails

SAMANTHA
(whispering)
Ooooh look at the scary werewolf
32103 TRICK OR TREAT Michael Dougherty 9

JEFF
(whispering)
Careful He might scratch your eyes

out

Samantha cackles Jeff grabs her and they start making out
Trying to look tougher Adrian takes out a cigarette

BUS DRIVER
Sharon Woods last stop

Adrian looks out the window

It looks like the town is getting ready for a parade The
street is getting crowded with costumed pedestrians Families
set up chairs along the sidewalk Stores are closing early

A TEENAGE GIRL in a school uniform walks right by the bus
trailed by THREE YOUNGER KIDS

ADRIAN‘S EYES go wide and he ducks below the window
EXT MAIN STREET —- SIDEWALK - SUNSET

The girl walks by the bus but doesn’t spot Adrian This is
HEATHER THOMPSON 16 She walks with the kids she’s
babysitting for the night Two twins AUTUMN and AMBER WILSON
and young TODD FOSTER They walk by A BAKERY and the camera
lingers on

EXT MAIN STREET - BAKERY

JIMMY McDANIEL 13 standing in the doorway munching on a
cupcake He sees the kids walk by and his eyes light up

JIMMY
Hey guys wait up

He’s about to dash out the door when THE BAKER grabs him by
the collar and pulls him back inside It’s his mother

JIMMY (cont’d)
C’mon ma I gotta go

JIMMYS MOTHER
Costume first

Jimmy fidgets as she puts a big black wig on him and we now
realize he’s dressed as a pale ghoulish DEAD ELVIS Finally
primped he bolts after his friends
32103 TRICK OR TREAT Michael Dougherty 10

EXT MAIN STREET - SIDEWALK

Jimmy catches up and finds a curious Todd in the midst of
questioning Heather

TODD
«then where’s your broom

HEATHER
I don’t ride a broom That’s just in
the movies

Jimmy rolls his eyes munching on a cupcake

JIMMY
Man he’s still stuck on this

BRANDON rides up next to them and hops off his bike still
holding the brown paper sack

BRANDON
What’s up Jerry’s Kids

JIMMY TODD HEATHER
Hey Braindead

Brandon smiles at Heather paying special attention to her

BRANDON
Who’s hungry

He opens the sack and pulls out A PLASTIC SANDWICH BAG filled
with bloody CHICKEN FEET The kids SQUEAL revolted Heather
snatches the bag hides it in her backpack

HEATHER
Jesus What the hell are you doing

BRANDON
Chicken feet For tonight You said
you needed some so I dug through the
butcher store dumpster

HEATHER
Listen we need to keep this quiet
Your parents would lynch me if they
knew what we were doing

BRANDON
(sulking)
“ Okay Sorry Was just trying to help

As they walk away Jimmy pats Brandon on the back
32103 TRICK OR TREAT Michael Dougherty 11

JIMMY
You’ve got a lot to learn about older
women

BRANDON

Piss off Jimmy
INT PANDORA’S BOX - SUNSET

PAN ACROSS shelves filled with occult items both familiar
and strange Ouija boards ceremonial candles crystals and
pendants This is PANDORA’S BOX the local occult shop

DORA a big woman in her 50s sits behind the counter
absorbed in a book but still keeping a watchful eye on her
store In the glass case behind her are various CEREMONIAL
DAGGERS

THE DOOR jingles and opens Heather and the kids file in

TODD
(loudly)
Heather it smells like pee in here

HEATHER
SHH

Dora looks up from her book not especially thrilled

Todd follows Heather as she inspects some candles The others
scatter into the store An overweight teen named CHARLIE
CORRIGAN stands at the end of the aisle slipping some
crystals into his pocket He sees Todd gawking and sneers

AUTUMN AND AMBER sit at a table using a Ouija Board trying
not to laugh while Brandon and Jimmy snicker at nude statues
of pagan goddesses

AT THE COUNTER

Heather eyes the daggers in the display case Dora looks at
her suspiciously

HEATHER (cont‘d)
(points to display case)
Ill take the ivory one

Dora looks at THE DAGGER Heather is pointing to It’s large
and ornate with a silver blade and a hilt that looks as if
it was carved from bone Dora smiles
32103 TRICK OR TREAT Michael Dougherty 12

DORA
Summoning ceremony eh You know what
youre getting into

HEATHER
I can handle myself

DORA
Then where are your candles for the
circle of protection

Heather holds up the black candles Dora shakes her head and
grabs some white candles from a shelf Brandon Jimmy and
the twins gather around the counter

DORA (cont‘d)
You kids think tonight’s just about
gettin’ a sugar high don’t ya

Jimmy nods excitedly chocolate icing smeared on his face

DORA (cont’d)
But do you know why you get dressed
up Or why you go door to door begging
for candy

They shake their heads Dora opens her thick book OLD
ENGRAVINGS and illustrations cover the yellowed pages

DORA (cont’d)

Of course you don’t Most people don’t
know that Halloween goes back
thousands of years It works just like
any other holiday Christmas
Passover Easter They all have their
traditions and their deities As for
Halloween it’s all about

(points to a page)
Samhain Celtic God of the Dead

(NOTE Dora pronounces Samhain correctly which is
technically SAW-wane

The kids lean over the counter staring at an illustration of
an EIGHT FOOT TALL HORNED DEMON standing in a pumpkin patch
It’s a classic image if somewhat cliche

BRANDON
(mockingly)
I‘d see him coming from a mile away
ai

32103 TRICK OR TREAT Michael Dougherty 13

She shows

DORA
It’s just a drawing Samhain is always
in costume so no one really knows
what he looks like Could be anywhere
Or anyone

JIMMY
(whispers to Brandon)
I thought it was SAM-hain

DORA
A common mispronunciation
(glares at Heather)
For an amateur

BRANDON
Well Sam sounds a lot less lame than
SAW-wane

DORA

Suit yourself But tonight is HIS
night And like any god he has his
rituals and his disciples

(flips pages in the book)
Demons Monsters The Undead

them artwork of Samhain surrounded by creatures--

vampires werewolves zombies you name it

She points to an old engraving of VILLAGERS CARVING PUMPKINS

DORA (contd)
-they all gather in his honor to
punish those who disobey his rules

TODD
What kinds of rules

DORA
Ones that might help you survive

BRANDON
(mumbles to himself)
Here we go

DORA
First carve a Jack O’Lantern and make
sure you keep it lit They represent
lost souls and lighting one is a
simple way of showing your respect

BRANDON
Easy enough Next
32103 TRICK OR TREAT Michael Dougherty

Dora sneers at him flips to AN ILLUSTRATION of corpses
rising from their graves while villagers flee in terror

DORA

Second since the dead are pretty sure
to go for a stroll it’s a good idea
to stay out of the cemetery Break
that rule and Sam--

(corrects herself)
Samhain- is likely to turn you into
one of them

Todd stares at Heather worried

DORA (cont‘d)
Number three People naturally thought
the notion of ghouls roaming the
streets was terrifying so costumes
were worn as a way of blending in

The kids gawk at an engraving of peasants in masks calmly
walking by a group of skeletal demons while another person

without a mask is being devoured by wolves

BRANDON
Like camouflage

DORA
Exactly So if I were you I’d get
your butts home before sunset and
don’t come back out until you’re
dressed for the occasion

Todd turns and looks outside It’s getting dark

DORA (cont‘d)
(teasing)
Tick tock tick tock tick tock

JIMMY
What about the candy

DORA
Well people once tried to find a way
to appease the appetites of Samhain
and his horde so they left crops and
baked goods out on their doorsteps
Like a sacrifice Over time it became
expected- and those who didn’t paid
dearly

JIMMY
Trick or treat
32103 TRICK OR TREAT Michael Dougherty 15

DORA
Youre smarter than you look kid

His smile fades He’s about to take another bite of his
cupcake when Dora snatches it from his hand

DORA (cont’d)
(looks at the cupcake)
One more Make sure you check your
candy before you gorge yourselves His
followers are a tricky bunch and
poison treats to keep people from
taking what’s rightfully theirs

She hands the cupcake back to Jimmy He stares at it his
appetite suddenly gone

BRANDON
Okay okay We break a stupid rule we
get on Sam’s shit list and he sends
some ghoulish hit man after us Fine
But what if you’re like some Halloween
Scrooge who breaks all of his rules

Dora smiles

IN THE BACKGROUND Charlie makes his way toward the door
trying to look casual His pockets filled with merchandise

DORA
Then Samhain himself will probably be
stopping by and he won’t be selling
cookies He might not come for you
tonight or even next year

Charlie slips out the door

DORA (cont’d)
---but he will come for you

EXT MAIN STREET - PANDORAS BOX - DUSK

Charlie waddles down the street and disappears in a crowd of
costumed pedestrians It‘s getting dark Streetlamps turn on

EXT ABOVE SHARON WOODS - DAY TO NIGHT

The small town is far below and as the sun begins to dip
below the horizon we TIME LAPSE from dusk to night Stars
appear Crickets sing Lights appear in the windows of homes
and stores
32103 TRICK OR TREAT Michael Dougherty 16

AN ORANGE FULL MOON RISES above the sleepy town Dark clouds
drift by and for a brief moment the moon almost looks like a
grinning faceA Jack O’Lantern in the sky

DISSOLVE TO
EXT SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

A REAL JACK O‘LANTERN eyes and mouth flickering orange
candlelight It suddenly falls hits the ground and SMASHES
Stringy guts splatter on the sidewalk at the feet of

CHARLIE His costume is nothing but a lame tee-shirt that
says “This IS my costume” He kicks at the remains and steps
through the mess Pumpkin guts SQUISH under his shoes

Charlie waddles down the sidewalk dragging a pillowcase
looking for something else to terrorize Crickets CHIRP and
the GIGGLES of unseen children echo in the dark

He spots a YOUNG BOY dressed in a GOBLIN COSTUME approaching
about a half block ahead Hes dragging a bag full of candy
almost as big as he is

Charlie looks at his own bag-- it’s barely half full He
looks at the boy’s-- his sack is ready to burst at the seams

Charlie smiles and lumbers toward his prey

The GOBLIN BOY tries to step around Charlie but he steps
right in front of him taking up the entire sidewalk Beat
They stare at each other

CHARLIE GRABS THE BOY‘S RUBBER MASK and spins it around so
the eyeholes face backward THE BOY DROPS HIS CANDY SACK
reaches up and tries to turn the mask back around Charlie
grabs the goods and takes off

CHARLIE
Trick or Treat kid

He snickers and leaves the boy behind
EXT SIDEWALK - LATER
A CANDY WRAPPER drops to the sidewalk

Charlie rounds a corner a half-eaten chocolate bar dangling
out of his mouth candy smeared on his chubby cheeks

SPLAT Something small hits him hard and fast splattering
against his chest
32103 TRICK OR TREAT Michael Dougherty 17

It’s an EGG The slimy yolk oozes down his shirt

CHARLIE
Son of a bitch

LAUGHTER echoes-- a faint childish giggling Infuriated
Charlie looks around but can’t find the source Finally he
spots the culprit peering out from behind a distant tree

The odd trick-or-treater is dressed as a little scarecrow
wearing bright orange pajamas and a flour sack mask with two
buttons for eyes and a permanent sewn-in grin We’1ll call him
SAM

He steps out from behind the tree reaches into his bag and
HURLS ANOTHER EGG

CHARLIE DUCKS and it hits a mailbox behind him

CHARLIE (cont’d)
What the hell is your problem

Sam just cackles then turns and scampers down the sidewalk
disappearing around a corner

Charlie chases after him fuming
EXT SUBURBAN STREET AROUND THE CORNER

Hes barely run a half block but is already wheezing He
stops to catch his breath and looks around

Its quiet Sam is nowhere to be seen Suddenly he hears his
tormentor’s unmistakable GIGGLE Charlie gathers himself up
and starts to run again when CRUNCH He looks down

Hes stepping on A LOLLIPOP shaped like a Jack O’Lantern

He reaches down to pick it up when and spots A CANDYBAR on
the sidewalk nearby followed by some LICORICE further ahead
Its a long trail of candy leading down the sidewalk

CHARLIE
Whoa

He looks around cautiouslystill keeping an eye out for
Sam There’s no sign of him

CHARLIE LUNGES and grabs every piece he can get his meaty
paws on throwing everything into his bag He progresses down
the sidewalk making short work of the candy trail following
it past the KREEG HOUSE and to the house next door
32103 TRICK OR TREAT Michael Dougherty 18

The trail stops

SCREAMING startles him as THREE BOYS come running out of
Kreeg’s yard chased by a small barking creature in a rubber
mask They nearly knock Charlie over their THREE STOOGES
COSTUMES covered in sticky red liquid

Baffled Charlie watches the boys tear down the street until
they’re gone He looks back at the dark Kreeg house and
catches a glimpse of a shadowy figure standing in the doorway
just as it slams shut

Charlie turns his attention back to the candy and tosses one
last lollipop into his bag No more candy No sign of Sam
either

He looks at the house next door

A MAILBOX is marked ‘Pierce’ A few decorations are taped to
the windows and A HUGE BOWL OF CANDY sits on the porch

Bingo Charlie grins

EXT PIERCE HOUSE FRONT PORCH

Charlie walks up a flight of steps onto the porch The house
is completely dark inside A moth circles a FLICKERING PORCH
LIGHT

THE CANDY BOWL sits on a small table with a note taped to the
edge “Sorry we’re not home help yourself to one piece”

Charlie looks around This is too good to be true Screw it
He grabs the bowl and plops down on the steps tearing open
the candy shoving one after another into his gaping maw

A HOMEMADE CARAMEL APPLE sits in the bowl half-buried by
candy He’s too busy devouring the chocolate to notice it

BEHIND CHARLIE THE FRONT DOOR creaks open Just slightly

Charlie continues stuffing his face with chocolate bars and
candy corn oblivious

THE PORCH LIGHT FLICKERS AGAIN briefly illuminating a TALL
DARK FIGURE stepping out of the doorway It moves slowly and
silently onto the porch careful not to step on dead leaves

Charlie continues eating

THE FIGURE INCHES CLOSER It pulls something out from behind
its back-- a glimmering BUTCHER KNIFE
32103 TRICK OR TREAT Michael Dougherty 19

Charlie grabs another candy bar and takes a bite The figure
steps directly behind him The knife moving toward his
headclose enough to cut a strand of hair

The figure slowly raises the knife

THE LIGHT FLICKERS AGAIN and THE FIGURE’S SHADOW is cast on
the steps Charlie spots it WHIPS AROUND and sees

THE FIGURE LOOMING ABOVE KNIFE RAISED HIGH
CHARLIE SCREEEEAMS THE FIGURE SCREEEEAMS

The light flickers on AND STAYS ON revealing STEVEN PIERCE
Screaming like a girl He brandishes the knife in one hand a
bright orange pumpkin cradled in the other

Charlie stops screaming So does Steven Easily the more
frightened of the two Steven nearly collapses gasping for
air

STEVEN
D-don’‘t beaf-f-fraid

Charlie sneers at the dorkish man and goes back to his
favorite activity-- eating Steven sits down next to him
with the pumpkin in his lap still catching his breath

STEVEN (contd)
Guess we gave each other quite the
scare eh

Charlie just GRUNTS and swallows a candybar

STEVEN (contd)
Yepquite the scare Whew I’m
Steven What’s your name son

Steven offers a handshake Charlie doesn’t even look at him
talking with a mouth full of creamy caramel

CHARLIE
(muffled)

Charlie drops a wrapper on the ground Steven looks slightly
annoyed JABS the wrapper with the knife and picks it up

STEVEN
Nice to meet you Charlie Sorry about
the knife It’s for the pumpkin not

32103 TRICK OR TREAT Michael Dougherty 20

He flashes the Boy Scout salute and LAUGHS Charlie doesn’t

STEVEN (contd)

about isn’t it Being scared Not that
you could tell by today’s standards
The holiday just isn’t the same No

Charlie BELCHES Steven shoots him a stern look

STEVEN (cont’d)
Excuse you
(beat)
Now when I was your age Halloween was
different

The kid rolls his eyes He knows hes in for it He reaches
into the bowl again about to grab the caramel apple--
but takes another candy bar instead

STEVEN (cont‘d)

Back then it was a real holiday about
tradition and family Why my dad and
I would spend hours carving pumpkins
and making caramel apples With real
caramel Not this bag of chocolate for
two bucks at Wal-Mart stuff Do you
even know what the heck goes into this
junk

Charlie just GRUNTS Steven looks at the bowl of candy sees
the apple still sitting there He continues gets more
passionate waving and poking the knife while he speaks

STEVEN (contd)
The magic is gone I mean look at
this
(points at empty street)
Years ago this street was filled with
vampires zombies werewolves maybe a
cute little witch or two

Charlie sighs When will this guy shut up

STEVEN (cont’d)
Now everyone’s afraid of Satanists or
serial killers or God knows what
else Can you believe that A
perfectly innocent holiday-- ruined
32103 TRICK OR TREAT Michael Dougherty 21

Steven SWIPES THE KNIFE close to Charlie’s face Too close
NOW he’s nervous Without taking his eyes off the knife he
finally GRABS THE CARAMEL APPLE Takes a bite

STEVEN (cont’d)
Why if I saw one of those freaks
wandering around my house you can bet
IdId

THUNK Steven STABS the knife into the pumpkin Smiles
Charlie is making short work of the apple The boy COUGHS
His eyes are wide Startled Worried Steven sees his fear

STEVEN (cont‘d)

Charlie slowly munches never taking his eyes off the blade

STEVEN (cont’d)

Charlie COUGHS Steven gets nostalgic

STEVEN (contd)
--Ssome warm pumpkin pie

Charlie COUGHS again harder He looks at Steven worried

STEVEN (cont‘d)

Charlie GAGS AND WHEEZES clutches his throat

CHARLIE DROPS THE APPLE and doubles over in agony trying to
hack up something in his throat Steven pats the boy’s back
trying to help but it doesn’t do any good His face is blue

HES CHOKING Charlie gawks at Steven eyes pleading

Steven casually picks up the apple breaks off a small piece
and uncovers A SMALL RAZOR BLADE covered in caramel and
blood

STEVEN (cont‘d)

Steven sits with the body with a look of child-like amusement
on his face Beat He digs through Charlie’s bag and pulls
out a lollipop He pokes the body with it just to make sure
then unwraps the lollipop and takes a lick

Steven looks around The street is empty and quiet A dog
barks in the distance There isn’t a soul in sight

Steven looks up and spots HEATHER and ADRIAN running to his
front gate alarmed by the screams He waves to her She half-
smiles and waves back like the bored babysitter she is

The kids raise their bags higher still waiting

He walks by the kitchen table where a pot of warm caramel
sits next to a pile of applesand razors

the world taste good

Steven opens a cabinet and removes a BURLAP SACK
EXT PIERCE HOUSE BACK PORCH - LATER

A porch light turns off The back door creaks open and Steven
pokes his head out looking around

The yard is huge dotted with trees and surrounded by a white
picket fence The neighboring yards are dark and silent The
coast is clear

Yanking on a thick rope he grunts and finally emerges from
the house dragging Charlies body-- now encased in the burlap
sack He drags it across the porch and down a small flight of
stairs They CREAK Loudly Steven pauses for a moment tries
to move more carefully and quietly

He reaches the bottom and yanks the sack a little too hard
The body tumbles and THUMPS down the stairs

STEVEN
DAMN IT

Steven flinches at the volume of his own voice and slaps a
hand over his mouth

Crickets chirp and the wind howls The chanting of TRICK OR
TREATERS echoes in the distance but it’s nothing to be
alarmed about He turns back to his task

shovel sits in a mound of dirt

Steven drops the sack next to the tarp panting and sweating
He looks over his shoulder All clear He pulls back the
plastic tarp revealing

A WIDE BUT SHALLOW GRAVE Another burlap sack already rests
at the bottom Its shape and fresh blood stains hint at
another recent victim

Steven yanks Charlie’s sack trying to drag it into the
grave It doesn’t budge He pulls again Still won’t move He
looks down and sees its caught on a tree root Steven pulls
harder and the bag TEARS

hits the bottom with a heavy THUD He throws a shovel full of
dirt on top when A LOW GROWLING startles him He looks up at
the nearby fence and sees

32103 TRICK OR TREAT Michael Dougherty 28

Spite chews on it like a piece of jerky Suddenly the
neighbors porch light turns on and the back door opens to

etched on his wrinkled face He wears a dirty robe and grips
a baseball bat like he’s looking for trouble

kicks it and the body quiets down

KREEG (0S)
I got an NRA membership in my pocket
and a shotgun in the closet so get

drag you out in pieces

and waves putting on a fake neighborly smile

STEVEN

The body tries to punch its way out of the sack Steven steps
on it hard trying to keep it still keep it quiet

With a swift kick the toy SQUEAKS and is sent flying across
the lawn

Hes on the back porch when A MUFFLED YELL catches Stevens
attention He stops and looks at OLD MR KREEG’S HOUSE

head against the door

THE CREATURE stares at himthen begins to SNICKER It

stolen by Charlie earlier in the evening

gritting his teeth trying to hide his anger

every corner Boxes old toys and rusty tools scattered
about

Steven picks at the blade with his thumb It breaks his skin
A small drop of blood oozes

His son is playing with the spoons and candles Oblivious

Slowly walking up behind Billy Steven brings the knife out
from behind his back and stares at it glistening in the
light A perverted smile stretches across his face as he
caresses the edge with his finger

WIDER ON THE ROOM to reveal
THE KNIFE buried to its hilt in
THE SEVERED HEAD OF CHARLIE CORRIGAN

It sits on the table-- his terror-filled eyes staring wide
his mouth frozen in a scream

Steven yanks the knife back out and gently places it in
Billy’s tiny hands wrapping his sons fingers around the
wooden handle

smiles proudly almost teary-eyed Together they stare at
the head It’s a real father and son moment

rethinking what she’s about to do The path ahead is dark
barely lit by the full moon above

LORI

She walks into the woods leaves crunching under her feet
EXT SHARON WOODS PATHWAY

AN OWL sits on a gnarled branch It HOOTS twists its head
watching Lori stroll down the dark path It narrows and
darkens as she heads deeper into the forest She tries to
keep herself calm checking every shrub and tree Crickets
and creaking branches are the only sounds to comfort her

Suddenly there’s A NOISE aheadsmall FOOTSTEPS CRUNCHING
LEAVES and something being DRAGGED It’s getting closer

Lori stops trying to see what’s coming
THE FOOTSTEPS ARE CLOSER She starts to back up when SAM

steps out of the darkness and into a shaft of moonlight

Relieved Lori sighs and keeps walking As they approach each
other Sam suddenly stops Lori looks down at him puzzled

as if looking at something behind her in the distance

Lori turns around but doesn’t see anything

LORI (cont’d)
What is it

Sam stares at Lori for a moment then continues on his way

Lori watches him leave not quite sure what just happened
She keeps walking listening to Sam’s footsteps fading behind
her

Then his footsteps stop Lori glances over her shoulder--
Sam is gone

seem to get larger swaying in the wind their twisted arms
veaching out for her It’s like she’s stepped into a dark
fairytale She tries to calm herself

And when Little Red Riding hood was in
the dark forest on her way to
Grandmother’s house she met a Big Bad

Lori turns bolts down the path looking back over her
shoulder Up ahead the pathway splits

TO THE LEFT-- the path veers into the woods

TO THE RIGHT-- the path winds towards an old COVERED BRIDGE
She heads for the bridge

INT COVERED BRIDGE -— ENTRANCE

Lori dives into the bridge and crouches by the entrance
hiding in the shadows She’s PANTING but trying to keep
quiet She catches her breath listening for the footsteps

hears nothing Beat She SIGHS and stands

Then she hears it again-- the distinct CLICK-CLACK of hard
soles on the pavement

Lori slowly peers out at the pathway She squints and sees

THE SHADOWMAN Drenched in black approaching the fork in the
road

Her breath quickens She pulls back into the bridge just
enough to stay hidden but still able to keep an eye on him

He’s getting closer to the fork

Lori carefully inches further into the bridge but THE
FLOORBOARDS creak with every step She stands perfectly
still never taking her eyes off the approaching stranger

He stops at the fork and looks down both paths Deciding

Suddenly Lori feels something on her hand She glances down
and sees A HUGE SPIDER is slowly making its way up her arm
32103 TRICK OR TREAT Michael Dougherty 78

She wants to scream but holds it in and closes her eyes
tight

A moment passes She opens her eyes to see

THE SHADOWMAN is gone Not heading down either path just
plain gone Lori looks puzzled

She quickly swats the spider off her arm and CRUSHES IT

Suddenly she hears LAUGHTER Faint and distant echoing from
the opposite end of the bridge It sounds familiar and
comforting She walks a little further into the bridge
careful not to make too much noise and sees it

THE ORANGE GLOW of a fire in the woods far ahead
EXT COVERED BRIDGE - EXIT

Lori emerges from the bridge and stops LOUD SCREAMS catch

She smiles relieved With her attention on the party she
doesn’t see

THE SHADOWMAN emerging from the bridge behind her

She gets ready to head for the party when she hears
BREATHING From behind Steady and deep So close that she
can feel it on her neck

A sense of dread washes over her She turns around and her
eyes lock on The Shadowman looming above She can’t see his
face but feels him staring at her She’s paralyzed gawking

Lori opens her mouth but before she can make a sound SHE’S
YANKED BACK INTO THE BRIDGE

building The group writhes and moans They caress and rub
each other ripping and clawing at their costumes exposing
naked and sweaty flesh Suddenly entwined arms and legs
stretch and distend Hair sprouts Their LAUGHTER and VOICES
meld into a guttural chorus of GROWLS Then all at once
they rear back and let out long terrifying HOWLS

Then all at once the wild and unruly pack becomes eerily
quiet They slowly turn away from Steven to look at

Sitting on a tree-stump kicking his legs back and forth like
an eager child The werewolves bow slightly in supplication
and Sam nods his head in approval

The pack turns back around and hungrily stares at Steven but
keeps its distance This kill belongs to Lori

Kreeg nearly has a coronary

KREEG

Spite wags his tail Kreeg is about to head inside when he
hears a faint YELP He looks over the fence into the yard
next door and something catches his eye

He can see the top of someone’s head poking out of what looks
like a freshly dug grave

KREEG (cont‘d)

Kreeg sees the dog looking inside the house He follows
Spite’s gaze looking down the hall to see

THE DOGGIE DOOR swinging back and forth settling shut as if
something just crawled through it

Spite heads down the hall and stops SNIFFING the air
Unafraid Kreeg sneers and steps back inside the house

SCREEEEEECH Kreeg is hit by a SWARM OF RED EYES WINGS
HANDS AND GHOULISH FACES He SCREAMS and falls to the
ground trying to fend off the attack

He stops recomposes himself panting Looks closer The
glowing eyes and leathery wings are only mechanical bats
They flutter a few more times and finally come to a stop The
ghoulish faces are just old masks and gloves that looked a
lot more sinister in the dark The cardboard box that fell
from the closet is labeled “HALLOWEEN DECORATIONS”

Kreeg gets to his feet embarrassed and angry

The shadowy figure scampers away disappearing into a corner
of the room

He grabs the gaping wound It’s bleeding badly soaking into
his pajamas Still he grits his teeth and tries to stand
but that familiar GIGGLE stops him in his tracks

Kreeg looks over and sees TWO SMALL FEET dangling off the
edge of his recliner too short to reach the ground They
kick back and forth childlike

behind his back

KREEG GASPS as Sam slowly reaches around and brings out A
CHOCOLATE BAR in a red wrapper Thick and halfeaten

Kreeg relaxes a little

Sam looks at the candybar then reaches up and pulls the
wrapper back further-- revealing A RAZOR BLADE stuck into the
creamy caramel center It’s covered in blood Kreeg’s blood
Sam looks at the blade then at the old man He GIGGLES

Kreeg tries to make a break for the front door but falls
again Sam skips towards him making playful stabbing motions
with the candy razor His voice is raspy and demonic with a
hint of childish glee

Kreeg tries to stand using the bat for support Sam toddles
over and KICKS THE BAT out from under him Kreeg collapses

Sam in the face SAM SCREECHES and falls to the ground His
candy bar slides across the floor

Sam rolls around in pain holding his head He SCREECHES more
like an animal than a child

He opens the barrel It’s loaded He cocks it then grabs a

into his robe pocket

But above Kreeg’s headSOMETHING is scurrying across the
ceiling It’s too dark to see exactly what

LIGHTNING FLASHES illuminating SAM crawling on the ceiling
like a spider He scurries directly over the old man staring
down at his prey

Kreeg turns another lock when he hears A FAINT SNICKER He
looks around but can‘t find the source Finally he realizes
it’s coming from above He slowly looks up just as

The seams tear as Sam continues to punch and SCREECH Kreeg
yanks the mask harder and it finally RIPS OFF plopping to

the floor The old man stares in horror at

SAM‘S FACE

A demonic visage not so different than the mask it resembles
a Jack O’Lantern made of flesh and bone pale veiny skin
sunken black eyes a skeletal nose and a permanent grin
filled with razor sharp teeth

His body slides and hits a wall with a THUD

Sam convulses and twitches for a few seconds then stops
Kreeg sits up panting He looks down the hall at the
motionless body still smoking and sizzling He picks up the
mask sitting next to him and painfully stands

He limps down the hall gun raised never taking his eyes off
the body

Kreeg stands over the corpse Half of Sam’s monstrous face
has been blown away Instead of red blood his innards are a
mix of stringy orange pumpkin guts seeds and thick black
blood

He takes two shells from his robe pocket and reloads the gun

waves to him then crawls up his chest over his shoulder
and reattaches itself at the end of the right arm Good as

covers a portion of his face and as he smiles we see his
gleaming sharp teeth are still in tact

blasted to bits leaving a skeleton wearing burned and
tattered orange pajamas Stringy moist organs dangle and
writhe from twisted bones He cocks his head to the side and
eerily waves at Kreeg-- hello there

Kreeg whimpers inching further back towards his chair
desperately looking for something he can use as a weapon

blade cleaning melted chocolate off the sharp edge He takes
an awkward step forward slowly walking towards the old man
