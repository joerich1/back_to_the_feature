PEDDLER Oh I come from a land
From a faraway place
Where the caravan camels roam
Where they cut off your ear Where its flat and immense
If they dont like your face And the heat is intense
Its barbaric but hey--its home
When the winds at your back
And the suns from the west
And the sand in the glass is right
Come on down
Stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly
To another Arabian night

Arabian nights

Like Arabian days
More often than not
Are hotter than hot
In a lot of good ways

Arabian nights

Neath Arabian moons

A fool off his guard
Could fall and fall hard
Out there on the dunes

Ah Salaam and good evening to you worthy friend
Please please come closer--(Camera zooms in hitting
peddler in face) Too close a little too close (Camera
zooms back out to CU)ThereWelcome to Agrabah City of
mystery of enchantment and the finest merchandise this
side of the river Jordan on sale today come on down
Heh heh Look at this Yes Combination hookah and
coffee maker--also makes Julienne fries Will not break
(taps it on table) will not--(it falls apart)--it
broke Ooohhh Look at this Pulls out Tupperware) I
have never seen one of these intact before This is the
famous Dead Sea Tupperware Listen (Pries it open
makes raspberry sound) Ah still good (Camera begins
to pan to right PEDDLER hurries to catch it) Wait
dont go (Stop pan)I can see that youre only
interested in the exceptionally rare I think then you
would be most rewarded to considerthis (PEDDLER
pulls the MAGIC LAMP out from his sleeve) Do not be
fooled by its commonplace appearance Like so many
things it is not what is outside but what is inside
that counts (Another pan this one slower to left
Again PEDDLER rushes to catch up) This is no ordinary
lamp It once changed the course of a young mans life
A young man who liked this lamp was more than what he

seemed A diamond in the rough Perhaps you would like
to hear the tale (PEDDLER pours shiny sand from the
lamp into his hand) It begins on a dark night (PEDDLER
throws sand into the sky where it forms a starry
nightscape) where a dark man waits with a dark
purpose

(Camera tilts down to find JAFAR sitting on his horse and IAGO
on his shoulder GAZEEM comes riding up to the pair)

JAFAR Youare late
GAZEEMA thousand apologies O patient one
JAFAR You have it then
GAZEEMI had to slit a few throats to get it (Pulls out
half of the medallion JAFAR reaches out for it
but GAZEEM yanks it back) Ah ah ahhh The treasure
(IAGO squawks as he flies by and grabs the medallion) Ouch
JAFAR Trust me my pungent friend Youll get whats
coming to you
IAGO Whats coming to you Awk

(JAFAR pulls out the second half of the medallion He connects
them and the insect medallion begins to glow Finally it
flies out of JAFARs hand scaring the horses and is off
towards the dunes)

JAFAR Quickly follow the trail

(All ride off following the glowing speck of light until
it reaches a large dune It separates into two and the
halves plunge into the dune All that remains are two glowing
points of light on the dune But then the dune begins to rise
up transforming into a giant lions head with the glowing
points serving as the eyes)

JAFAR At last after all my years of searching the cave
of wonders

IAGO Awk Cave of wonders

GAZEEM By Allah

JAFAR Now remember Bring me the lamp The rest of the
treasure is yours but the lamp is mine

(GAZEEM starts to approach the lions mouth which forms the
entrance to the cave He chuckles as he goes)

IAGO Awk the lamp Awk the lamp (Now that IAGO and
JAFAR are alone IAGO opens up in normal English)
Jeez whered ya dig this bozo up

(JAFAR puts his finger to his lips and shushes him GAZEEM reaches
the cave but is blown away by the roar of the caves speaking)

CAVE Who disturbs my slumber
GAZEEM It is I Gazeem a humble thief
CAVE Know this Only one may enter here One whose

worth lies far within A diamond in the rough
(GAZEEM turns to JAFAR with a questioning look)
JAFAR What are you waiting for Go on

(GAZEEM hesitates then moves one foot inside the cave With
great apprehension he plants his foot down Nothing happens
Relieved he begins his trek again Then another roar comes
He turns back but the lions mouth slams shut and the dune
collapses back to normal All that are left are JAFAR IAGO
and the two separated halves of the medallion)

CAVE Seek thee out the diamond in the rough
(IAGO unburied himself from the sand coughing as he does so)

IAGO I cant believe it I just dont believe it Were
never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp Just
forget it Look at this Look at this Im so
ticked off that Im molting (He flies up to
JAFARs shoulder)

JAFAR Patience Iago Patience Gazeem was obviously
less than worthy

IAGO (Extremely sarcastically) Oh theres a big
surprise Thats an incred--I think Im gonna have
a heart attack and die from not surprise Whatre
we gonna do We got a big problem herea big prob-
(JAFAR pinches his beak shut)

JAFAR Yes we do Only one may enter I must find this
one thisdiamond in the rough

(Cut to a rooftop where ALADDIN rushes up to the edge carrying
a loaf of bread He almost drops it over the edge)

GUARD Stop thief Ill have your hands for a trophy
street rat

ALADDIN (Looks back then down then at the bread) All
this for a loaf of bread

(He jumps off landing on two ropes strung between buildings with
drying clothes on them He skies down them collecting bits
and pieces of clothing on him as he goes Finally hes
nearing the end of the rope at a window when a woman reaches

out and slams the shutters closed ALADDIN slams into the
shutters and falls to the street his fall being broken by
numerous awnings and the pile of clothes around him He pulls
off the top layer of clothes and is about to enjoy his bread

when)
GUARD 1 There he is
GUARD 2 You wont get away so easy
ALADDIN You think that was easy

(He looks at three women laughing at him)

GUARD 1 You two over that way and you with me Well

(ALADDIN pulls a sheet over him and wraps himself as a disguise
He rushes over to the women)

ALADDIN Morning ladies

WOMAN 1 Getting into trouble a little early today arent

ALADDIN Trouble No way Youre only in trouble if you
get caught--

(A hand grabs ALADDINs shoulder and yanks him back Its the
first GUARD ALADDINs disguise falls off)

ALADDIN Im in trouble

GUARD and this time--(A screeching sound from ABU
then the guards turban is pulled down over his
eyes ABU dances on the GUARDs head laughing)

ALADDIN Perfect timing Abu
ABU Hello
ALADDIN Come on lets get outta here

One swing ahead of the sword

I steal only what I cant afford

Thats everything

(ALADDIN battles a GUARD wielding a sword He dodges a couple of
swings then pulls down the GUARDs pants ABU raspberries the
GUARD then dodges an attack The GUARD swings at ALADDIN
but destroys a barrel of fish As ALADDIN runs off the GUARD

pulls a fish over his lower body as a pair of pants)

One jump ahead of the lawmen
Thats all and thats no joke
These guys dont appreciate Im broke

(ALADDIN and ABU scamper up a pile of barrels then kick one down
on top of another GUARD)

GUARDS (one at a time) Riffraff Street rat
Scoundrel Take that
ALADDIN Just a little snack guys

(ALADDIN scampers to the top of a platform The GUARDS shake the
platform back and fro trying to knock him off)

GUARDS Rip him open take it back guys

ALADDIN I can take a hint gotta face the facts
Youre my only friend Abu

WOMEN Who

(ALADDIN jumps off the platform to certain death only to grab ABUs
hands like an acrobat The pair swing into a harem)

Oh its sad Aladdins hit the bottom
Hes become a one-man rise in crime
(ABU finds a plate full of fruit and stuffs his mouth full like a
chipmunk )

WOMAN Id blame parents except he hasnt got â€˜em
ALADDIN Gotta eat to live gotta steal to eat
Tell you all about it when I got the time

(ALADDIN and ABU exit Cut to MUSCLEMAN flexing to a crowd The
GUARDS rush past Cut to ALADDIN and ABU behind the MUSCLEMAN
matching his moves until they make a mistake and are discovered)

One jump ahead of the slowpokes

One skip ahead of my doom

Next time gonna use a nom de plume

One jump ahead of the hitmen

One hit ahead of the flock

I think Ill take a stroll around the block

(A chase sequence in which ALADDIN and ABU pursued by the GUARDS
race through a flock of sheep hurdle a MAN sleeping on a bed of
nails of course one extremely large GUARD lands on him ABU

disguises himself with jewels until a SHOPKEEPER discovers him

CROWD Stop thief Vandal
Outrage Scandal
ALADDIN Lets not be too hasty

(ALADDIN is surrounded by GUARDS in front of a door The door opens
and a large ugly LADY comes out)

LADY Still I think hes rather tasty

(ALADDIN tumbles away then puts his arm around a GUARD acting
like theyre all chums)

ALADDIN Gotta eat to live gotta steal to eat
Otherwise wed get along
GUARDS WRONG

(They all jump into a pile and fight When they stop ALADDIN and
ABU are gone They are sneaking away in barrels They run
across a flaming pit followed by GUARDS who hop up and down
screaming in pain as they cross the rocks ALADDIN and ABU
pass a SWORD SWALLOWER then ABU goes back pulls the sword
out of the SWALLOWERs mouth ABU advances on the guards
who retreat in fear)

GUARD 1 Hes got a sword
GUARD 2 You idiot--weve ALL got swords

(ABU sets the sword down gently then runs ALADDIN and ABU are
once again surrounded with GUARDS coming from left and right
He jumps up and climbs a robe trick being done on the street
as the GUARDS all crash into each other)
ALADDIN One jump ahead of the hoofbeats
CROWD Vandal

ALADDIN One hop ahead of the hump

CROWD Street rat

ALADDIN One trick ahead of disaster

CROWD Scoundrel

ALADDIN Theyre quick--but Im much faster
CROWD Take that

(The GUARDS chase ALADDIN up a staircase into a room He grabs a
carpet and jumps out the window)

ALADDIN Here goes better throw my hand in
Wish me happy landin
All I gotta do is jump

(The GUARDS follow him out the window but they go straight down to
the street and land in a pile with the sign Crazy Hakims
Discount Fertilizer ALADDIN uses the carpet as a parachute
to land safely and out of danger ALADDIN and ABU high-five each
other)

ALADDIN And now esteemed effendi we feast All right

(ALADDIN breaks the bread in two and gives half to ABU who begins
to eat But ALADDIN looks over and sees two young children
rummaging through the garbage for food The GIRL sees him then
drops her find and tries to hide ALADDIN looks at them then
the bread then at ABU)

ABU Uh-oh

(ABU takes a big bite of his food but ALADDIN gets up and walks
over to the children The GIRL pulls her brother back)

ALADDIN Here go on--take it

(The children giggle with delight ABU tries to swallow his bite
then looks guilty He walks over to the children and offers his
bread to them In delight they pet him on the head)

ABU Ah dont Huh

(ABU sees ALADDIN walking into the daylight where there is a parade
going onALADDIN peers over the shoulders of people He sees

PRINCE ACHMED riding on a horse)

BYSTANDER 1 On his way to the palace I suppose
BYSTANDER 2 Another suitor for the princess

(ALADDIN is startled as the two children come running out from the
alley The BOY runs out in front of the PRINCEs horse
startling it)

PRINCE Out of my way you filthy brat
(The PRINCE brings up his whip to attack the children but ALADDIN
jumps in front of them and catches the whip)

ALADDIN Hey if I were as rich as you I could afford some manners
PRINCE Oh--I teach you some manners

(The PRINCE kicks ALADDIN into a mud puddle The crowd laugh at him)

ALADDIN Look at that Abu Its not every day you see a
horse with two rear ends

(The PRINCE stops and turns back to ALADDIN)

PRINCE You are a worthless street rat You were born a
street rat youll die a street rat and only
your fleas will mourn you

(ALADDIN rushes the PRINCE but the doors to the castle slam shut
in his face)

ALADDIN Im not worthless And I dont have fleas Come
on Abu Lets go home

(ALADDIN makes the climb to his home with the view then tucks in
ABU for the night)

ALADDIN Riffraff street rat
I dont buy that
If only theyd look closer
Would they see a poor boy No siree
Theyd find out theres so much more to me

(He pulls back a curtain to reveal the beautiful palace)

Someday Abu things are gonna change Well be
rich live in a palace and never have any problems
at all

(Dissolve to same shot during day Cut to int of SULTANs chamber
The door bursts open and PRINCE ACHMED storms in missing the
rear end of his pants)

PRINCE Ive never been so insulted

SULTAN Oh Prince Achmed Youre not leaving so soon are
you

PRINCE Good luck marrying her off

SULTAN Oh Jasmine Jasmine Jasmine (The SULTAN goes
off into the garden looking for his daughter He
finds her but is interrupted by RAJAH JASMINEs
pet tiger who blocks him off RAJAH has a piece
of the PRINCEs undershorts in his mouthThe SULTAN
grabs the cloth and yanks it out of RAJAHs mouth)
Confound it Rajah So this is why Prince Achmed
stormed out

JASMINE Oh father Rajah was just playing with him
werent you Rajah (RAJAH comes over and allows
JASMINE to pet and hug him) You were just playing
with that overdressed self-absorbed Prince Achmed
werent you (She cuddles with RAJAH enjoying the
moment until she looks up at her angry father
Ahem

SULTAN Dearest youve got to stop rejecting every suitor
that comes to call The law says you

BOTH -must be married to a prince

(They walk over to a dove cage)
SULTAN By your next birthday

JASMINE The law is wrong
SULTAN Youve only got three more days

JASMINE Father I hate being forced into this (She takes

a dove out of the cage and pets it) If I do marry
I want it to be for love

SULTAN Jasmine its not only this law (She hands him
the dove and he puts it back in the cage) Im not
going to be around forever and I just want to make
sure youre taken care of provided for

JASMINE Try to understand Ive never done a thing on my

own (She swirls her finger in the water of the
pond petting the fish)Ive never had any real
friends (RAJAH looks up at her and growls)

Except you Rajah (Satisfied he goes back to
sleep) Ive never even been outside the palace
walls

SULTAN But Jasmine youre a princess

JASMINE Then maybe I dont want to be a princess (She
splashes the water)

SULTAN Oooohhh Allah forbid you should have any
daughters

(RAJAH looks up and thinks for a second JASMINE goes to the dove
cage and yanks open the door The birds fly off into freedom
She watches them go Cut to int of SULTANs chambers)

SULTAN I dont know where she gets it from Her mother
wasnt nearly so picky (A shadow falls over him
He looks up startled and sees JAFAR) Ooh oh

Ah Jafar--my most trusted advisor I am in
desperate need of your wisdom

JAFAR My life is but to serve you my lord (He bows)

SULTAN Its this suitor business Jasmine refuses to
choose a husband Im at my wits-end

IAGO (In the parrot voice) Awk Wits-end

SULTAN Oh ha ha Have a cracker pretty polly (He
pulls a cracker out from his pocket IAGO looks
terrified Then the SULTAN stuffs it in IAGOs
mouth IAGO grimaces as he tries to eat it JAFAR
and the SULTAN both laugh)

JAFAR Your majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals

(IAGO glares at him) Now then perhaps I can
divine a solution to this thorny problem
SULTAN If anyone can help its you

JAFAR Ah but it would require the use of the mystic blue
diamond

SULTAN Uh my ring But its been in the family for
years

JAFAR It is necessary to find the princess a suitor
(JAFAR says the word princess with the accent on
the second syllable cess He turns his staff
with a cobra head towards the SULTAN The eyes of
the staff begin to glow The room darkens JAFARs
voice slows down and deepens The SULTANs eyes
get a hypnotized look) Dont worry Everything
will be fine

SULTAN Everythingwill befine

JAFAR The diamond

SULTAN Here Jafar Whatever you need will be fine

(The SULTAN removes his ring and hands it to JAFAR The room returns
to normal as JAFAR pulls back the staff)

JAFAR You are most gracious my liege Now run along and
play with your little toys
SULTAN (Still hypnotized) Yesthatll bepretty good

(JAFAR and IAGO exit We follow them When theyre out of the room
the parrot spits out the cracker)

IAGO I cant take it anymore If I gotta choke down on
one more of those moldy disgusting crackersbam
Whack

(JAFAR pulls a rope which reveals a hidden entrance to his chambers)

JAFAR Calm yourself Iago

IAGO Then Id grab him around the head Whack Whack

JAFAR (Speaking over IAGO) Soon I will be sultan not
that addlepated twit

IAGO And then I stuff the crackers down his throat Ha
ha

(The pair pass through a door and slam it shut Diss to ext gardens
at night A shadowy figure walks through We see it is JASMINE
in disguise She reaches the palace wall then begins to climb it

She is tugged from behind by RAJAH)

JASMINE Oh Im sorry Rajah But I cant stay here and
have my life lived for me Ill miss you (She
begins to climb again and is helped up by RAJAH
who begins to whine and whimper) Good bye

(She disappears over the wall Cut to daytime on the street ALADDIN
and ABU are up to their capers again They are on top of the
awning of a fruit stand)
ALADDIN Okay Abu Go
(ABU dips over the edge and looks at the PROPRIETOR)

PROPRIETOR (To passing crowd) Try this your taste buds
will dance and sing (ABU grabs a melon and
hangs there distracting his attention) Hey
get your paws off that

ABU Blah blah blah

PROPRIETOR Why you Get away from here you filthy ape

(He grabs the melon away from ABU But in the foreground ALADDIN
dips down and snatches another melon from the stand)

ABU Bye bye

(He zings back up The PROPRIETOR takes the melon to the front
where he places it on top of a stack He looks confused like
he has just done this)

ALADDIN Nice goin Abu Breakfast is served

(ALADDIN and ABU on the roof break open the melon and eat We see J
ASMINE walking through the street)

SHOPKEEPER 1 Pretty lady buy a pot No finer pot in brass
or silver

SHOPKEEPER 2 Sugar dates sugar dates and figs Sugar
dates and pistachios

SHOPKEEPER 3 Would the lady like a necklace A pretty

necklace for a pretty lady

(She is charmed by the action but is startled by a fish thrust
into her face)

SHOPKEEPER 4 Fresh fish We catch em you buy â€˜em

JASMINE I dont think so (She backs away but bumps into
a fire eater who is startled into swallowing his
fire) Oh excuse me (He gulps then belches

fire from his mouth JASMINE is disgusted He is
pleased and taps his stomach ALADDIN sees her

and a strange look comes over his face) Im
really very sorry
ALADDIN (Hes obviously deeply in love with her) Wow

(She pulls the hood of her cloak over her head ABU sees him and
jumps up on his shoulder waving his hand in front of ALADDINs
face)

ABU Uh oh Hello Hello
(JASMINE stops at the fruit stand and sees a young homeless child
reaching for a piece of fruit She picks one up and gives it to

him)

JASMINE Oh you must be hungry Here you go (The
boy runs off)
PROPRIETOR Youd better be able to pay for that

JASMINE (Mystified) Pay

PROPRIETOR No one steals from my cart

JASMINE Oh Im sorry sir I dont have any money
PROPRIETOR Thief

JASMINE Please if you let me go to the palace I can

get some from the Sultan
PROPRIETOR Do you know what the penalty is for stealing

(He takes her hand and pins it down on the table intending to
chop it off)

JASMINE No no please

(The sword drops but his hand is stopped by ALADDINs)

ALADDIN Thank you kind sir Im so glad youve found
her Ive been looking all over for you

JASMINE (whispering) What are you doing

ALADDIN (whispering back) Just play along

PROPRIETOR You know this girl

JASMINE Sadly yes She is my sister Shes a little
crazy (He circles his finger around his ear
She is shocked The PROPRIETOR grabs him by
the vest)

PROPRIETOR She said she knows the Sultan

ALADDIN She thinks the monkey is the Sultan

(ABU is picking a pocket He hears this then straightens up

JASMINE playing along kneels and bows to ABU)

JASMINE Oh wise Sultan How may I serve you

ABU Well blah blah blah blah

ALADDIN Tragic isnt it (He leans forward picking
up another apple from the cart with his
foot) But no harm done (Walks over to
Jasmine) Now come along sis Time to see the
doctor

JASMINE (To a camel standing nearby) Oh hello doctor
How are you

ALADDIN No no no Not that one (To ABU whose

pockets are bulging) Come on Sultan

(ABU bows to the crowd and everything hes stolen from the cart falls
out)

PROPRIETOR Huh What is it (ABU picks up what he can
carry and the trio run off) Come back here
you little thieves

(Cut to int of JAFARs lab IAGO is running on a gear in a bizarre
contraption At the top of the contraption is a storm brewing)

IAGO (huffing and puffing) With all due respect your
rottenness couldnt we just wait for a real storm
JAFAR Save your breath Iago Faster (He places the
SULTANs ring in the contraption)
IAGO Yes o mighty evil one

(IAGO runs faster A lightning bolt streaks through the ring passing
into an hourglass below The sands begin to swirl)

JAFAR Ah sands of time--reveal to me the one who can

enter the cave (The sand in top forms the Cave of

Wonders It falls through into a storm but it

shows ALADDIN climbing up a ladder followed by

JASMINE who is covered in her cloak) Yes yes

There he is My diamond in the rough

IAGO Thats him Thats the clown weve been

waitin for (IAGO loses his footing and is sucked

into the gears)

JAFAR Lets have the guards extend him an invitation to

the palace shall we

(IAGO goes flying past and slams into the wall upside down)
IAGO Swell

(JAFAR laughs hideously and the camera zooms in on the sandstorm with
ALADDIN in it Finally we dissolve into the real ALADDIN climbing
to the top of the ladder followed by JASMINE)

ALADDIN Almost there

(JASMINE climbs over the top but trips and falls into ALADDINs arms
She stands up)

JASMINE I want to thank you for stopping that man
ALADDIN Uh forget it (He grabs a pole) So uh this is
your first time in the marketplace huh

(ALADDIN pole vaults to the next building leaving JASMINE behind)

JASMINE Is it that obvious

ALADDIN Well you do kinda stand out (He stares at her
still in love She returns the look But he
realizes what he is doing and returns to normal)

I mean uh you dont seem to know how dangerous
Agrabah can be (He lays a plank between the
buildings for her to walk over but as he is leaned
down she vaults over his head He looks back in
surprise She tosses the pole to him Both
ALADDINs and ABUs eyes bulge)

JASMINE Im a fast learner
ALADDIN Right Cmon this way (They go inside the roof
of a building dodging planks and beams as they
go) Whoa Watch your head there Be careful
JASMINE Is this where you live
ALADDIN Yep Just me and Abu Come and go as we please
JASMINE Fabulous

ALADDIN Well its not much (he pulls back the curtain and
exposes the palace) but its got a great view
Palace looks pretty amazing huh

JASMINE Oh its wonderful

ALADDIN I wonder what it would be like to live there to
have servants and valets

JASMINE Oh sure People who tell you where to go and how
to dress

ALADDIN Its better than here Always scraping for food
and ducking the guards

JASMINE Youre not free to make your own choices

ALADDIN Sometimes you feel so--

JASMINE Youre just--

BOTH (in unison) --trapped

(They look at each other realizing that theyre perfect for one
another But ALADDIN then realizes where he is and breaks the
look He takesthe apple out of ABUs hand and rolls it down his
arm into the hand of JASMINE)

ALADDIN So wherere you from

JASMINE What does it matter I ran away and I am not
going back

ALADDIN Really (He takes a bite from the apple in his

hand then hands it to ABU who has a disgusted
look on his face)
ABU Why you

(ALADDIN walks over and sits next to JASMINE)
JASMINE My fathers forcing me to get married

ALADDIN Thats--thats awful (ABU appears from behind the
princess and tries to steal the apple) Abu

(ABU races up to a higher point chattering and cursing as he goes)

JASMINE What

ALADDIN Abu says that--uh--thats not fair

ABU What

JASMINE Oh did he

ALADDIN Yeah of course

JASMINE And does Abu have anything else to say

ALADDIN Well uh he wishes there was something he could do
to help

ABU Oh boy

JASMINE Hmm tell him thats very sweet

(ALADDIN and JASMINE have been getting closer and closer until
ALADDIN leans in to kiss her He is interrupted however
by the GUARDS who have found them)

GUARD Here you are

ALADDIN and JASMINE Theyve found me (To each other) Theyre
after you

JASMINE My father must have sent them--

ALADDIN Do you trust me

JASMINE What
ALADDIN Do you trust me (He extends his hand)
JASMINE Yes (She takes it)
ALADDIN Then jump

(They both jump off the roof fall and land in a pile of salt They
try to get away but the exit is blocked by a GUARD)

GUARD We just keep running into each other dont we
street rat

(Again the GUARDs turban is pulled down by ABU but more guards are
here and block the exit The first GUARD pulls ABU off his head and
throws him in a vase Three other GUARDS grab ALADDIN)

GUARD Its the dungeon for you boy

ALADDIN Hey get off of me

JASMINE Let go of him

GUARD (Not realizing she is the princess) Look what we
have here men--a street mouse (He throws her
down)

JASMINE (standing up and pulling off the hood of her cloak
Unhand him by order of the princess

(The GUARDS suddenly stop and bow forcing ALADDIN to bow as well)

GUARD Princess Jasmine

ALADDIN The princess

ABU (peeking out from the vase) The princess

GUARD What are you doing outside the palace And with
this street rat

JASMINE Thats not your concern Do as I command Release
him

GUARD Well I would princess but my orders come from
Jafar Youll have to take it up with him

(The GUARDS drag ALADDIN out bowing as they go)

JASMINE (getting a very pissed-off look) Believe me I
will

(Cut to int of palace JAFAR emerging from his secret chambers He
slides the door shut carefully but the princess comes storming
in before he is finished He slams it shut pinning IAGO inside
the door frame)

JASMINE Jafar
JAFAR Oh uh princess
TAGO Awk Jafar Im stuck

JAFAR How may I be of service to you (He spreads out his
cape hiding the door)

JASMINE The guards just took a boy from the market on your
orders

JAFAR Your fathers charged me with keeping peace in
Agrabah The boy was a criminal

JASMINE What was the crime

TAGO I cant breathe Jafar

JAFAR Why kidnapping the princess of course

IAGO If you could just--(JAFAR kicks him back inside the
door and it slams shut)--wow that hurt
JASMINE He didnt kidnap me I ran away

JAFAR (Walking away as if shocked) Oh dear Oh why
frightfully upsetting Had I but known

JASMINE What do you mean

JAFAR Sadly the boys sentence has already been carried
out

JASMINE What sentence

JAFAR (with a sinister tone) Death (JASMINE gasps)
By beheading

JASMINE No (She collapses to the floor)

JAFAR I am exceedingly sorry princess

JASMINE How could you (She runs from the room crying)

(IAGO finally makes it out through the door He flies up and lands on
JAFARs shoulder coughing)

TIAGO So how did it go
JAFAR I think she took it rather well (They both get a
sinister smile on their faces)

(Diss to JASMINE at night crying at the edge of the fountain RAJAH
comes over to comfort her She pets him)

JASMINE Its all my fault Rajah I didnt even know his
name

(Cut to int of dungeon Rats scurry by and we descend until we see
ALADDIN chained to the wall)

ALADDIN (to himself) She was the princess I dont believe
it I must have sounded so stupid to her
ABU (from a distance) Yoo-hoo Aladdin Hello

(ABU appears at the window at the top of the dungeon)

ALADDIN Abu Down here Hey cmon--help me outta these

(ABU stops then begins chattering wildly dropping to the ground He
wraps a cloth around his head and makes his eyes big in an
imitation of the princess)

ALADDIN Hey she was in trouble Ah she was worth it

(ABU jumps up on ALADDINs shoulders and pulls a small set of tools
out of his pocket then frees ALADDIN)

ABU Yeah yeah yeah

ALADDIN Dont worry Abu Ill never see her again Ima
street rat remember and theres a law Shes
gotta marry a prince she deserves it

(ABU finally frees ALADDINs hands)
ABU Ta da
ALADDIN (Rubbing his wrists) Im a--Im a fool
OLD MAN Youre only a fool if you give up boy

(We see an OLD MAN sitting in the corner that neither ALADDIN nor ABU
have seen before)

ALADDIN Who are you

OLD MAN A lowly prisoner like yourself But together
perhaps we can be more

ALADDIN Im listening

OLD MAN There is a cave boy A cave of wonders Filled

with treasures beyond your wildest dreams
Treasure enough to impress even your princess Id
wager

(Listeners will note that the OLD MAN pronounced the word
princess as prin-CESS rather than the standard pronunciation
of PRIN-cess The OLD MAN turns his back and IAGO sticks
his head out of JAFARs old man disguise)

IAGO Jafar can ya hurry it up Im dyin in here
ALADDIN But the law says that only a prince can marry--
OLD MAN Youve heard of the golden rule havent you boy

Whoever has the gold makes the rules (He grins
showing a hideously bad mouth)

ALADDIN So why would you share all of this wonderful
treasure with me

OLD MAN I need a young man with strong legs and a strong
back to go in after it

ALADDIN Ah one problem Its out there were in here

(The OLD MAN walks to a wall and pushes open a hidden exit)

OLD MAN Mmm mmm mmm Things arent always what they
seem So do we have a deal

(ALADDIN looks at ABU who shrugs his shoulders)
ABU Oh hmm

(Cut to desert scene We see ALADDIN leading a horse with the
OLD MAN and ABU on it Diss to cave of wonders)

CAVE Who disturbs my slumber
ALADDIN It is I Aladdin
CAVE Proceed Touch nothing but the lamp

(The cave opens up with a roar and a staircase appears in front of

ALADDIN )
OLD MAN Remember boy--first fetch me the lamp and then
you shall have your reward
ALADDIN Cmon Abu (to ABU hiding under the shoulder of

his vest)
(ALADDIN begins to descend the staircase He reaches the bottom
and enters a golden chamber filled with treasure)

ALADDIN Would ya look at that
ABU Uh oh
ALADDIN Just a handful of this stuff would make me richer

than the sultan
(ABU peeks out sees the treasure then bolts for it)
ALADDIN Abu
(ABU stops in mid run hovering over a rug on the floor)
ALADDIN Donttouchanything We gotta find that lamp

(They begin to make their way through the room when the CARPET rises
off the floor and begins following them ABU gets the feeling
theyre being followed)

ABU Huh

(He turns and the CARPET lies flat on the floor He continues and
the CARPET begins to follow again Again ABU turns back but the
CARPET is rolled up and leaning against a pile of treasure ABU
runs to ALADDIN and tugs his pant leg)

ABU Aladdin Aladdin
ALADDIN Abu will ya knock it off

(Again the CARPET follows but this time when ABU turns the carpet
jumps to the other side It reaches down with a tassel and pulls
ABUs tail When ABU jumps around CARPET again goes to the other

side This time ABU lands in a karate stance CARPET reaches
down and plucks ABUs hat off then puts it on himself ABU sits
thinking for a second until CARPET waves a tassel in front of his
face ABU and CARPET both jump scared and run away ABU tackles
ALADDIN and turns his head to look at the CARPET)

ALADDIN Abu what are you--crazy
(The CARPET peeks out from behind a pile of treasure)

ALADDIN A magic carpet Cmon Cmon out Im not gonna
hurt you

(The CARPET slowly comes out shyly then picks up ABUs hat and dusts
it off It flies over to ALADDIN and hands the hat to ABU next to
him ABU screeches and jumps onto ALADDINs shoulder)

ALADDIN Take it easy Abu Hes not gonna bite

(The CARPET again picks up ABUs hat and hands it to him ABU shakes
his fist and screeches at it CARPET begins to walk away sadly)

ALADDIN Hey wait a minute Dont go Maybe you can help
us (CARPET looks back excited It then flies

over and wraps around the pair) Hey whoa You
see were trying to find this lamp (CARPET
motions for them to follow it) I think he knows

where it is

(They pass through a long cave until they emerge in a giant
underground cavern In the centre of the room is a tall pillar
with a staircase going up to it It is surrounded by water
with unevenly placed stones forming a bridge At the top of
the pillar is a beam of light ALADDIN begins to cross the bridge)

ALADDIN Wait here
ABU Oh Huh

(ABU sees a Shrine with a golden monkey The outstretched paws hold a
giant ruby ABU is hypnotically drawn to it ALADDIN climbs the
stairs quickly CARPET sees ABU and grabs his tail trying in vain

to hold him back ALADDIN finally reaches the MAGIC LAMP)

ALADDIN This is it This is what we came all the way down
here to-- (He looks down and sees ABU break free
of CARPETs hold and lunge toward the jewel) Abu-
NO

(ABU grabs the jewel There is a rumbling and the room begins to
shake)

CAVE VOICE Infidels
ABU Uh oh
CAVE VOICE You have touched the forbidden treasure (ABU
places the jewel back into the paw but the jewel
and the shrine melt into lava) Now you
will never again see the light of day

(ALADDIN races down the steps but they flatten into a ramp and he
skies down until he flies into the air The water has turned into
lava He is falling toward it when all of a sudden CARPET appears
and catches him ABU is standing on one of the rocks of the
bridge He looks left and right and sees rocks exploding into lava
Then CARPET races over and ALADDIN grabs him just as the last rock
is exploding)

ALADDIN Whoa Carpet lets move

(Together they race back through the caves dodging walls and falling
debris ABU grabs ALADDINs head and covers his eyes)

ALADDIN Abu this is no time to panic (He pulls ABU off
his head and sees they are flying into a wall)
Start panicking

(CARPET goes into a dive then through another cave Finally they
emerge through the internal entrance Outside the cave begins to
growl and close CARPET and company are almost to the top when a
boulder drops on carpet sending it to the floor ALADDIN grabs
onto the rock wall and holds on He sees the OLD MAN at the top
within reach)

ALADDIN Help me out

OLD MAN Throw me the lamp

ALADDIN I cant hold on Give me your hand
OLD MAN First give me the lamp

(ALADDIN reaches in and pulls out the MAGIC LAMP He hands it up a
nd the OLD MAN raises it above his head)

OLD MAN Ha ha ha ha Yes At last Ha ha ha ha

(ALADDIN has climbed out with the assistance of ABU But the OLD
MAN kicks aside ABU and grabs ALADDINs wrist)

ALADDIN What are you doing
OLD MAN Giving you your reward (JAFAR returns to his
normal voice) Your eternal reward

(He pulls out a crooked dagger and is about to stab ALADDIN when
ABU bites him on the wrist He screams but lets go of ALADDIN
who falls into the cave OLD MAN throws ABU into the cave as
well They fall CARPET sees this but is pinned under a
boulder It struggles to break free then does It races
up and catches ALADDIN but he has already hit the wall several
times and is unconscious On the surface the cave roars one
final time then sinks back into the sand JAFAR pulls off
his disguise)

JAFAR Heh heh heh Its mine Its all mine I (He cant
find it in his pocket)--- where is it No NO

(Kiss fade to JASMINEs bedroom She is sitting on her bed next
to RAJAH who looks sad The SULTAN walks in)

SULTAN Jasmine Oh dearest Whats wrong

JASMINE Jafarhasdone something terrible (She
looks as if shes been crying)

SULTAN There there there my child--well set it right
Now tell me everything

(Cut to int of cave ALADDIN lies unconscious on the CARPET
ABU tries to wake him)

ABU Oh oh Aladdin Wake up Aladdin

(CARPET rises up lifting ALADDIN up He awakes slowly)

ALADDIN Oh my head (He looks at the entrance sealed in)
Were trapped (Angry shaking his fists at the
entrance) That two faced son-of-a-jackal (Calmer)
Whoever he was hes long gone with that lamp

ABU Aha

(ABU pulls out the MAGIC LAMP)
ALADDIN

Why you hairy little thief Looks like such a
beat-up worthless piece of junk Hey I think
theres something written here but its hard to
make out

(He rubs the LAMP Suddenly smoke comes out of the hole the
LAMP begins to shake and glow but ALADDIN holds onto the
LAMP and our wonderful friend the GENIE comes out)

GENIE

ALADDIN
GENIE

ALADDIN

GENIE

ALADDIN
GENIE

Aaaaahhhhh OY Ten-thousand years will give ya
such a crick in the neck (He hangs ALADDIN on a
nearby rock Then he pulls his head off and spins
it around yelling as he does so CARPET pulls a
ALADDIN down) Whoa Does it feel good to be
outta there (GENIE uses the lamp end of himself as
a microphone) Nice to be back ladies and
gentlemen Hi where ya from (Sticks the mic in
ALADDINs face) Whats your name
Uh Al--uh--Aladdin
(Says his name as if hes discovered something
major) Aladdin (A neon sign lights up wit
ALADDINs name on it circled by chase lights The
sign changes to reflect the GENIEs upcoming line)
Hello Aladdin Nice to have you on the show Can
we call you Al Or maybe just Din Or how
bout Laddi (GENIE disappears then a dog
wrapped in plaid jumps in) Sounds like Here boy
Cmon Laddi
(Shaking his head) I must have hit my head harder
than I thought
(Still a dog) Do you smoke Mind if I do (Dog
poofs into smoke then back to the GENIE ABU
screeches wildly) Oh sorry Cheetah--hope I
didnt singe the fur Hey Rugman Havent seen
you in a few millennia Slap me some tassel Yo
Yeah (CARPET flies over and high fives the GENIE
GENIE looks at ALADDIN) Say youre a lot smaller
than my last master (Lifts his beer-gut) Either
that or Im gettin bigger Look at me from the
side--do I look different to you
Wait a minute Im--your master
(Slaps a diploma in ALADDINs hand and a
mortarboard on his head) Thats right He can
be taught What would you wish of me (as Arnold
Schwarzenegger) the ever impressive (inside a
cube) the long contained (as a ventriloquist with
a dummy) often imitated (tosses the dummy aside)
but never duplicated--

(He multiplies into multiple GENIES who surround him)

DUP GENIES Duplicated duplicated duplicated

GENIE

duplicated duplicated duplicated
duplicated duplicated duplicated
(Says it like a ring announcer at a boxing match)
Genie Of The Lamp (Goes into Ed

Sullivan) Right here direct from the lamp right
here for your enjoyment wish fulfillment

Thank youuuuu

ALADDIN Whoa Wish fulfillment

GENIE Three wishes to be exact And ix-nay on the
wishing for more wishes (Turns into a slot
machine arm pulls down and three GENIEs appear in
the windows) Thats it--three (Three GENIE
caballeros come out of the slot) Uno dos tres
(Changes into bw Groucho Marx) No
substitutions exchanges or refunds (The duck
drops with the secret word Refunds

ALADDIN (To ABU) Now I know Im dreaming

GENIE (Music for Friend Like Me begins) Master I dont
think you quite realize what youve got here So
why dont you just ruminate whilst I illuminate
the possibilities (GENIE lights up like a
fluorescent light)

Well Ali Baba had them forty thieves
Scheherazadie had a thousand tales

But master you in luck cause up your sleeve
You got a brand of magic never fails

(GENIE produces 40 thieves who surround ALADDIN with swords
GENIE appears in his vest then sticks his arms out and boxes
the thieves into submission)

You got some power in your corner now

Some heavy ammunition in your camp

You got some punch pizzazz yahoo and how
See all you gotta do is rub that lamp

And Ill say

(Boxing ring appears ALADDIN in the corner being massaged
by GENIE Then GENIE turns into a pile of fireworks and
explodes Then GENIE appears inside lamp and grabs ALADDINs
hand and rubs lamp with it)

Mister Aladdin sir

What will your pleasure be

Let me take your order jot it down
You aint never had a friend like me
No no no

(GENIE produces a table and chairs then writes down things on a
note pad like a waiter

Life is your restaurant

And Im your maitre d

Cmon whisper what it is you want
You aint never had a friend like me

(GENIE appears as a plate of chicken then returns to normal
but enlarges his ear to listen to ALADDIN Finally he explodes
into four duplicate GENIEs)

Yes sir we pride ourselves on service
Youre the boss the king the shah

Say what you wish its yours True dish
How about a little more Baklava

(The GENIEsS give him a shave haircut and manicure then ALADDIN
appears in a comfy chair (eh) surrounded by the treasure
and being fanned by women The GENIE appears and fills the
screen with baklava)

Try some of column A

Try all of column B

Im in the mood to help you dude

You aint never had a friend like me

(ALADDIN rises up on a column of food with a giant A on top
then jumps to another column with a B on top He falls off
and is caught by a cushion held by GENIE He opens his mouth
and his tongue turns into a staircase A miniature GENIE
dressed like a magician comes out)

(The mini GENIE does a little dance with the GENIEs two giant
hands At the end they surround the mini GENIE and squish
him into nothing)

Can your friends do this

Do your friends do that

Do your friends pull this out their little hat
Can your friends go poof

Well looky here

Can your friends go Abracadabra let â€˜er rip
And then make the sucker disappear

(The GENIE pulls off his head duplicates it then juggles them
He tosses them to ALADDIN who juggles with one hand and spins
one of the heads on his fingertip like a basketball He tosses
the heads back onto the GENIE who proceeds to try and pull
himself out of a hat at his base He spirals around and around
until he turns into a white rabbit The rabbit transforms into
a purple dragon (very reminiscent of Figment from EPCOT Center)
The dragon breathes fire which turns into three HAREM GIRLS
who dance around ALADDIN Just as he begins to enjoy them
they disappear)

So dont you sit there slack jawed buggy eyed
Im here to answer all your midday prayers

You got me bona fide certified

You got a genie for a charg daffairs

I got a powerful urge to help you out

So what you wish I really want to know

You got a wish thats three miles long no doubt
So all you gotta do is rub like so and oh
(GENIE imitates what he is calling ALADDIN then turns into a
certificate which rolls up and surrounds ALADDIN GENIE pulls
a list written in Arabic out of ALADDINs ear which he uses
to rub his behind like drying off after a shower)

Mister Aladdin sir have a wish or two or three
Im on the job you big nabob
You aint never had a friend never had a friend
You aint never had a friend never had a friend
You aint neverhad a friend likeme
You aint never had a friend like me

(The dancing HAREM GIRLS reappear and ALADDIN leans in to kiss one
She turns into the GENIE who zaps four dancing elephants into
existence To the other direction he zaps in four dancing camels
and a grand finale dancing number ensues ABU grabs as much gold
as he can but the GENIE wraps everything up in a cyclone and
zaps it away until theyre all back in the cave GENIE has a
neon APPLAUSE sign on his back ABU turns his hat over and
sees that is is empty)

GENIE So whatll it be master

ALADDIN Youre gonna grant me any three wishes I want

GENIE (As William F Buckley) Ah almost There are a
few provisos a couple of quid pro quos

ALADDIN Like

GENIE Ah rule number one I cant kill anybody (He
slices his head off with his finger) So dont
ask Rule two I cant make anyone fall in love
with anyone else (Head turns into a big pair of
lips which kiss ALADDIN) You little punim there
(Lies flat then gets up and transforms into a
zombie) Rule three I cant bring people back from
the dead Its not a pretty picture (He grabs
ALADDIN and shakes him) I dont like doing it (He
poofs back to normal) Other than that you got
it

ALADDIN (Looks at ABU as if plotting) Ah provisos You
mean limitations On wishes (To ABU) Some all
powerful genie--cant even bring people back from
the dead I dont know Abu--he probably cant even
get us out of this cave Looks like were gonna
have to find a way out of here--

(They start to leave but a big blue foot stomps down in front of
them )

GENIE Excuse me Are you lookin at
me Did you rub my lamp Did you wake me up did
you bring me here And all of a sudden youre
walkin out on me (Gets madder and madder) I
dont think so not right now Youre gettin your

wishes so siddown (They all get on CARPET
GENIE takes the form of a stewardess with lots of
arms pointing out the exits) In case of

emergency the exits are here here here
herehere here here here here here here
here anywhere Keep your hands and arms inside
the carpet Weeeerrrrrreeeoutta here

(The CARPET and passengers fly out of the sand in the desert and off
into the distance Cut to int of SULTANs chamber JAFAR is
there with IAGO JASMINE and the SULTAN)

coming in for a landing)

GENIE

ALADDIN

Carpet for all your travel needs Dont stand

CARPET) Thank you Good bye good bye Thank you

shoulders and looks like Arsenio Hall Then becomes
a tailorfashion designer) First that fez and

vest combo is much too third century

he flies over)
Uh oh

Here he comes (ALADDIN and GENIE are on a game
show set where ALADDIN stands behind a podium with

AL on it) And what better way to

make your

grand entrance on the streets of Agrabah than

riding your very own brand new camel
it spits (A door bearing the GENIE
opens where ABU is transformed into

Watch out
s head on it
a camel He

spits out the side of his mouth on cue But the

GENIEs not sure) Mmm not enough

(He snaps his

fingers and ABU turns into a fancy white horse)
Still not enough Lets see What do you need
(The GENIE snaps his fingers repeatedly turning
ABU into a duck an ostrich a turtle and a 57

Cadillac with license plate ABU 1

(That ones

a guess I dont know cars but judging by the tail
fins nuff said) Finally hes returned to

normal) Yes Esalalumbo shimin

dumbo Whoa

(And on the keyword of the spell Dumbo ABU turns
into an elephant CARPET struggles to get out from
under ABUs size 46 feet) Talk about your trunk

space check this action out

(ABU sees his reflection in a pool of water
The tree naturally bends right back down to the ground where ABU
hangs on and looks at ALADDIN upside down)

ALADDIN

Abu you look good

then jumps into a tree
GENIE Hes got the outfit hes got the elephant but
were not through yet Hang on to your turban
kid cause were gonna make you a star

(We zoom out slowly with the oasis in the distance as fireworks
begin to explode outward Cut to a CU of a pile of toys
(Look for the BEAST here) We tilt up and see the SULTAN
balancing them He carefully balances the last piece on top

then sits back and sighs JAFAR storms in though and the
pile collapses)

JAFAR Sire I have found a solution to the problem with
your daughter

IAGO Awk The problem with your daughter

SULTAN Oh really

JAFAR (Unrolling a scroll) Right here If the princess
has not chosen a husband by the appointed time
then the sultan shall choose for her

SULTAN But Jasmine hated all those suitors (He tries to
stuff a cracker into IAGOs mouth IAGO backs
away The SULTAN absentmindedly pulls the cracker
back) How could I choose someone she hates
(IAGO is relieved but the SULTAN quickly stuffs a
cracker in his mouth)

JAFAR Not to worry my liege There is more If in the
event a suitable prince cannot be found a princess
must then be wed tohmminteresting

SULTAN What Who

JAFAR The royal vizier Why that would beme

SULTAN Why I thought the law says that only a prince can
marry a princess Im quite sure

JAFAR Desperate times call for desperate measures my
lord (He pulls out the staff and hypnotizes the
SULTAN with it)

SULTAN Yesdesperate measures

JAFAR You will order the princess to marry me

SULTAN Iwill orderthe princessto(the spell
breaks momentarily)but youre so old

JAFAR (Holds the staff closer) The princess will marry
me

SULTAN The princess will marry(the spell is again
broken this time by the trumpet fanfare of Prince
Ali) What What is that That music Ha ha ha

Jafar you must come and see this

(We see an advancing parade led by what appears to be the GENIE in
human form as a MAJOR)

MARCHERS Make way for Prince Ali
SWORDSMEN Say hey Its Prince Ali
MAJOR Hey clear the way in the old bazaar
Hey you let us through its a bright new star
Now come be the first on your block to meet his eye
Make way here he comes
Ring bells bang the drums
Youre gonna love this guy
(The MAJOR mingles amongst different crowd members)

Prince Ali fabulous he Ali Ababwa
Genuflect show some respect
Down on one knee

(ABU the elephant marches through town with ALADDIN (ALI) on his back)

Now try your best to stay calm
Brush up your Sunday Salaam
And come and meet his spectacular coterie

(IAGO is dancing to the music until JAFAR glares at him The
MAJOR wheelbarrows six men up onto ABUs trunk They stand
on each others shoulders as ALI shakes hands)

Prince Ali mighty is he Ali Ababwa
Strong as ten regular men definitely
He faced the galloping hordes
A hundred bad guys with swords
Who sent those goons to their lords why Prince Ali
(The pile collapses on ALI but a GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt
zaps the pile and he ends up holding them all up in an acrobatic
wheel formation The GENIE turns into an old man then a child
and speaks the last two lines to the crowd)
CHORUS OF MEN (Carrying the camels) Hes got seventy-five golden camels
(In pops a typical parade commentator)
HARRY Dont they look lovely June
CHORUS OF WOMEN (On a float) Purple peacocks hes got fifty-three

(In comes another commentator)

JUNE Fabulous Harry I love the feathers
GENIE (GENIE is off screen a giant balloon gorilla proceeds down
the parade)

When it comes to exotic type mammals
Has he got a zoo Im telling you
Its a world class menagerie

(GENIE pops in as a leopard then a goat and speaks the last two
lines to the two children from earlier We cut to a balcony
where three HAREM GIRLS are joined by the HAREM GENIE)

GENIE
GIRLS (in couterpoint)
Prince Ali Handsome is he Ali Ababwa
Theres no question this Alis alluring
That physique how can I speak
Never ordinary never boring
Weak at the knee
Everything about the man just plain impresses
Well get on out in that square
Hes a wonder hes a whiz a wonder
Adjust your veil and prepare
Hes about to pull my heart asunder
To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali
And I absolutely love the way he dresses

(JASMINE has been watching from the balcony of the palace She
humphs it off then leaves)

CHORUS Hes got ninety-five white Persian monkeys
(Hes got the monkeys lets see the monkeys)
And to view them he charges no fee
(Hes generous so generous)
Hes got slaves hes got servants and flunkies
(Proud to work for him)
They bow to his whim love serving him
Theyre just lousy with loyalty to Ali Prince Ali

(ALADDIN throws gold coins out to the people who rush over to
collect them ABU and the parade march up the steps of the
palace and inside The SULTAN runs back inside to the door
to the throne room but JAFAR stands in front of the door
Suddenly it bursts open with ABU leading the way and crushing

JAFAR and IAGO behind the door)

GENIE Prince Ali
Amorous he Ali Ababwa
Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see
And thatgood people is why
He got dolled up and dropped by
With sixty elephants llamas galore
With his bears and lions
A brass band and more
With his forty fakirs his cooks his bakers
His birds that warble on key
Make way for Prince Ali

(More and more fanfare build up until ALADDIN flies off ABUs back
on MAGIC CARPET and flies down to the SULTAN JAFAR slams the
door shut)

SULTAN (Clapping) Splendid absolutely marvelous

ALADDIN (Takes on a deeper voice) Ahem Your majesty I have
journeyed from afar to seek your daughters hand

SULTAN Prince Ali Ababwa Of course Im delighted to

meet you (He rushes over and shakes ALIs hand)
This is my royal vizier Jafar Hes delighted
too

JAFAR (Extremely dryly) Ecstatic Im afraid Prince
Abooboo--

ALADDIN --Ababwa

JAFAR Whatever You cannot just parade in here uninvited
and expect to--
SULTAN by Allah this is quite a remarkable device
(He tugs at the tassels and they tug his
moustache) I dont suppose I might

ALADDIN Why certainly your majesty Allow me

(He helps the SULTAN up onto the CARPET and he plops down
JAFAR pins the CARPET down on the floor with the staff)

JAFAR Sire I must advise against this--
SULTAN --Oh button up Jafar Learn to have a little fun

(He kicks away the staff and CARPET and SULTAN fly away IAGO who
was standing on the head of the staff falls down repeatedly
bopping the staff with his beak as he descends SULTAN and
CARPET fly high into the ceiling then begin a dive-bomb attack

flying under ABU scaring him The flight continues in the
background while JAFAR and ALI talk in the foreground

JAFAR Just where did you say you were from

ALADDIN Oh much farther than youve traveled Im sure
(He smiles JAFAR does not)
JAFAR Try me (IAGO lands on the staff)

SULTAN Look out Polly

(They all duck in time as the CARPET whizzes centimetres over their
heads CARPET returns and the SULTAN chases IAGO around the room)

TIAGO Hey watch it Watch it with the dumb rug

(The CARPET zooms underneath IAGO who sighs wipes his brow and
crashes into a pillar He crashes to the floor and his head
is circled by miniature SULTANS on CARPETS saying Have a cracker
have a cracker The real SULTAN begins his final approach)

SULTAN Out of the way Im coming in to land Jafar
watch this (He lands)

JAFAR Spectacular your highness

SULTAN Ooh lovely Yes I do seem to have a knack for
it (CARPET walks over to ABU dizzily then
collapses ABU catches it) This is a very
impressive youth And a prince as well (Whispers
to JAFAR) If were lucky you wont have to marry
Jasmine after all

JAFAR I dont trust him sire

SULTAN Nonsense One thing I pride myself on Jafar Im
an excellent judge of character

IAGO Oh excellent judge yeah surenot

(JASMINE walks in quietly)

SULTAN Jasmine will like this one

ALADDIN And Im pretty sure Ill like Princess Jasmine
JAFAR Your highness no I must intercede on Jasmines
behalf (JASMINE hears this and gets mad) This

boy is no different than the others What makes
him think he is worthy of the princess
ALADDIN Your majesty I am Prince Ali Ababwa (He pricks
JAFARs goatee which springs out in all

directions) Just let her meet me I will win
your daughter

JASMINE How dare you (They all look at her surprised)
All of you standing around deciding my future I
am not a prize to be won (She storms out)

SULTAN Oh dear Dont worry Prince Ali Just give
Jasmine time to cool down (They exit)

JAFAR I think its time to say good bye to Prince
Abooboo

(Diss to JASMINE on her balcony at night We tilt down and find

ALADDIN and company in the courtyard)

ALADDIN What am I going to do Jasmine wont even let me
talk to her I should have known I couldnt pull
off this stupid prince wish (ABU struggles with
his elephant paws to open a banana He squishes
it and the banana squirts into his eye He then
tosses the banana peel into a heaping pile of the

same)

GENIE (to carpet playing chess) So move (CARPET does
knocking a black piece off the board) Hey
Thats a good move (As Rodney Dangerfield) I
cant believe it--Im losing to a rug

ALADDIN Genie I need help

GENIE (as Jack Nicholson) All right sparky heres the

deal You wanna court the little lady you gotta
be a straight shooter do ya follow me

ALADDIN What

GENIE (Back to normal wearing a mortarboard He points
out his words on a blackboard) Tell her

ALADDIN No way If Jasmine found out I was really some
crummy street rat shed laugh at me (He
puts on his turban which lights up as the GENIE)

GENIE A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh
(ALADDIN pulls the chain turning off the light

GENIE comes out holding the real turban) Al all
joking aside you really oughtta be yourself
ALADDIN Hey thats the last thing I want to be Okay

confident How do I look
GENIE (Sadly) Like a prince

(ALADDIN flies up to the balcony on CARPET JASMINE is on her
sighing RAJAH is by her side)

ALADDIN (From a distance) Princess Jasmine
(RAJAH looks up and growls)
JASMINE Whos there

ALADDIN Its me--Prince Ali Ahem--(Then he jumps to his
deep voice) Prince Ali Ababwa

bed
JASMINE I do not want to see you

ALADDIN No no please princess Give me a chance (RAJAH
growls and advances on him)

JAFAR Just leave me alone

ALADDIN Down kitty

(Over the edge of the balcony CARPET is watching with GENIE below)
GENIE Hows our beau doing

(CARPET cuts his neck with his finger)

ALADDIN Good kitty take off Down kitty (He takes off
his turban to brush RAJAH away)

JASMINE (She looks at him thinking she has seen him
before) Wait wait Do I know you

ALADDIN (Quickly replaces his turban) Uh no no

JASMINE You remind me of someone I met in the marketplace

ALADDIN The marketplace (A bee buzzes around his head)

I have servants that go to the marketplace for me
Why I even have servants who go to the marketplace
for my servants so it couldnt have been me you

JASMINE (She looks disappointed) No I guess not

BEE (Its the GENIE) Enough about you Casanova Talk

ALADDIN (Swats at bee) Buzz off

BEE Okay fine But remember--bee yourself (BEE buzzes into
is turban)

ALADDIN Yeah right

JASMINE What

ALADDIN Uh youre right You arent just some prize to be

to make your own choice (JASMINE and RAJAH look
at each other in confusion) Ill go now (He
steps up on the ledge and drops off)

JASMINE No

ALADDIN (Pokes his head up from over the edge) What What

JASMINE (Now shes amazed) How--how are you doing that
(She looks over the edge and sees the CARPET)

ALADDIN Its a magic carpet

JASMINE Its lovely (CARPET takes JASMINEs hand with a
tassel)

ALADDIN You uh you dont want to go for a ride do you
We could get out of the palace see the world

JASMINE Is it safe

ALADDIN Sure Do you trust me

JASMINE (She looks at him at the saying of that all-
important line) What

ALADDIN (Extends his hand the same as before) Do you trust
me

JASMINE (Gets a sly grin on her face) Yes

(She takes his hand and gets up on CARPET It zooms into the sky
knocking them both into sitting positions The music of A Whole
New World swells JASMINE looks back and sees RAJAH looking
up at her questioningly She gasps as they fly over the palace
wall and into the sky)

ALADDIN I can show you the world
Shining shimmering splendid
Tell me princess now when did you last
Let your heart decide

(CARPET zooms down through the town stopping slightly to pick a
flower It gives the flower to ALADDIN who gives it to JASMINE
She smiles)

I can open your eyes

Take you wonder by wonder
Over sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

(CARPET does as ALADDIN sings then zooms into the clouds)

A whole new world

A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no

Or where to go

Or say were only dreaming

(JASMINE looks back and watches Agrabah disappear from sight CARPET
flies in and out of the clouds)

JASMINE A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when Im way up here
Its crystal clear
That now Im in a whole new world with you
ALADDIN Now Im in a whole new world with you

(They each catch a small cloud as CARPET continues the flight It
then circles a pillar of clouds giving a swirly look to it)

JASMINE Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring tumbling freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

(They join a flock of birds in the sky One of them looks terrified
and squawks CARPET does somersaults and flips at times putting
ALADDIN and JASMINE in free-fall but catching them They then
zoom above the clouds where a starry night awaits them)

JASMINE A whole new world

ALADDIN Dont you dare close your eyes
JASMINE An hundred thousand things to see
ALADDIN Hold your breath--it gets better
JASMINE Im like a shooting star

Ive come so far
I cant go back to where I used to be

(They zoom down over a river apparently the Nile for beyond the
ships sails are the Great Pyramids They wave at a worker
sculpting the complete nose of the Sphinx He smiles but

chisels too much and breaks off the front section of the nose)

ALADDIN A whole new world

JASMINE Every turn a surprise
ALADDIN With new horizons to pursue
JASMINE Every moment red-letter

(They fly alongside wild horses running JASMINE pets one of them)

BOTH Ill chase them anywhere
Theres time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

A whole new world
Thats where well be

(They fly through Greece where ALADDIN grabs an apple from a
tree and rolls it down his arm to JASMINE who is now sure
she is dealing with ALADDIN not PRINCE ALI)

ALADDIN A thrilling chase
JASMINE A wondrous place
BOTH For you and me

(CARPET hovers along over a lake and we see the reflection of
the moon in the lake Fireworks burst and we see the couple
at a Chinese New Year celebration sitting on a rooftop)

JASMINE Its all so magical
ALADDIN Yeah

JASMINE (She looks at him and decides to burst the bubble)
Its a shame Abu had to miss this

ALADDIN Nah He hates fireworks (CARPET looks up
realizing what is happening) He doesnt really
like flying either (And now ALADDIN realizes it)
That isoh no

JASMINE (She pulls off his turban) You are the boy from the
market I knew it Why did you lie to me

ALADDIN Jasmine Im sorry

JASMINE Did you think I was stupid

ALADDIN No

JASMINE That I wouldnt figure it out

ALADDIN No I mean I hoped you wouldnt No thats not
what I meant

JASMINE Who are you Tell me the truth

ALADDIN The truth (He looks at CARPET who wave him on
giving up hope) The truththe truth isI
sometimes dress as a commoner to escape the
pressures of palace life (CARPET slumps down in
defeat) But I really am a prince (The feather on

his turban falls down over his eyes)

JASMINE Why didnt you just tell me

ALADDIN Well you know umroyalty going out into the

city in disguise it sounds a little strange
dont you think
JASMINE Not that strange

(She flicks up the feather and cuddles with him CARPET puts a
tassel under his chin and looks mystified Dissolve to ext
of palace balcony where ALADDIN and JASMINE return CARPET
forms a set of steps and she descends ALADDIN then descends

just below the balcony)

JASMINE Good night my handsome prince
ALADDIN Sleep well princess

(They slowly lean forward to kiss but CARPET bumps him up and they
kiss sooner than expected She walks away slowly then turns and
looks at him Finally she enters her room through the curtain)

ALADDIN Yes (He falls back onto the CARPET who descends
to the ground) For the first time in my life
things are starting to go right

(He looks up at JASMINEs balcony and four sets of hands grab him)
ALADDIN Hey What (A gag is tied around his mouth

Muffled words) Abu Abu (We see the elephant

hanging from a net tied in a tree)

GUARD Hold him

(Shackles are placed on his feet and his hands Another GUARD ties
CARPET in a knot around a tree)

JAFAR Im afraid youve worn out your welcome Prince
Abooboo (Walks away) Make sure hes
never found

(A GUARD hits him in the head and he falls unconscious Cut toa

cliff where GUARDS laugh as ALADDINs body drops into the water
He is conscious now but his feet are tied to a rock The rock

hits the sea bottom then the turban lands and the lamp tumbles
out He sees this and struggles to rub the lamp However he
loses consciousness and falls to the floor The lamp unsettled
by his movement rolls down and rubs against his hands It shakes
and GENIE emerges with a bath brush rubber duckie and shower cap)

GENIE Never fails Get in the bath and theres a rub at
the lamp (Squeaks the duck) Hello (Sees
unconscious ALADDIN) Al Al Kid snap out of it
You cant cheat on this one I cant help you
unless you make a wish You have to say Genie I
want you to save my life Got it Okay Cmon
Aladdin (He grabs ALADDIN by the shoulders and
shakes him His head goes up then falls) Ill
take that as a yes (Head turns into a siren)
Wooga Wooga (Turns into a submarine) Up
scope (He babbles in something that sounds like
German On the surface a giant water spout
emerges and lands on top of the cliff ALADDIN
reawakes and coughs the water out of his lungs)
Dont you scare me like that

ALADDIN Genie I--uh I-uh(He cant think of how to say
it so they just hug each other) Thanks Genie

GENIE Oh Al Im gettin kind of fond of you kid Not
that I want to pick out curtains or anything

(Cut to JASMINE in her room humming A Whole New World and brushing
her hair The SULTAN appears in one of the double doorshypnotized)

SULTAN Jasmine

JASMINE Oh father--I just had the most wonderful time
Im so happy

SULTAN (Still monotone from the hypnosis) You should be
Jasmine I have chosen a husband for you

JASMINE What

SULTAN (The other door opens and reveals JAFAR) You will

(JASMINE gasps at the sight of him)

JAFAR Youre speechless I see A fine quality ina
wife

JASMINE I will never marry you (She goes to the SULTAN)
Father I choose Prince Ali

JAFAR Prince Ali left

(A quick pan finds ALADDIN standing in the doorway to the balcony)

ALADDIN Better check your crystal ball again Jafar
JASMINE Prince Ali
(JAFAR gasps at the sight of ALADDIN)

TAGO How in the he--(back to parrot-ese)--uh awk
ALADDIN Tell them the truth Jafar You tried to have me
killed

JAFAR What (He goes to the SULTAN) Ridiculous
nonsense your highness He is obviously lying
(He brings the staff close to the SULTANs face)
SULTAN Obviouslylying

(ALADDIN sees the staff with its glowing eyes)

JASMINE Father whats wrong with you
ALADDIN I know

(ALADDIN grabs the staff and smashes it on the floor JAFAR flinches
and the spell is broken for good)

SULTAN Oh oh oh my

ALADDIN Your highness Jafars been controlling you with
this (He advances the staff)

SULTAN What Jafar You you traitor

(The trio advances on JAFAR)

JAFAR Your majesty all of this can be explained

SULTAN Guards Guards

IAGO Well thats it--were dead forget about it Just
dig a grave for both of us Were dead

(But JAFAR sees the lamp in ALADDINs pocket He makes a move but
is grabbed by guards)

SULTAN Arrest Jafar at once
JAFAR This is not done yet boy

(JAFAR pulls a vial from his pocket ALADDIN sees this and rushes
him but JAFAR throws the vial to the floor A large red cloud
appears When it is gone so is JAFAR)

SULTAN Find him search everywhere
ALADDIN Jasmine are you all right
JASMINE Yes

(They lean in to kiss but the SULTAN barges between them)

SULTAN Jafar my most trusted counselor plotting against
me all this time Just horrible How will I ever-
(He stops in mid sentence and looks at the pair)
Can it be true My daughter has finally chosen a
suitor (She nods) Ha ha Praise Allah You

Yes yes And youll be happy and prosperous and

ALADDIN

Sultan
Yes a fine upstanding youth like yourself a
person of your unimpeachable moral character is
exactly what this kingdom needs (ALADDIN looks
concerned at this)

int of JAFARs chambers JAFAR and IAGO enter)
We gotta get outta here We gotta get-- I gotta

start packing your highness Only essentials
(IAGO starts throwing things out of his cage

JAFAR smiles broadly) Travel light Bring the
guns the weapons the knives (Stops and takes out
a picture of himself and JAFAR) and how about

this picture I dont know--I think Im making a
weird face in it (JAFAR starts to laugh wildly)
Oh boy--hes gone nuts Hes cracked (IAGO
flies down to him and knocks on his head) Jafar
Jafar Get a grip Jafar (JAFAR grabs him around
the neck) Good grip
Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin
Aladdin He has the lamp Iago

Why that miserable--
But you are going to relieve him of it

Me

ext of palace ALADDIN is looking at the gardens)

Sultan They want me to be sultan

(GENIE comes out of lamp)

GENIE

ALADDIN
GENIE

ALADDIN

GENIE
ALADDIN

Huzzah Hail the conquering hero (Turns into a
one-man band He sees ALADDIN walk away with his
head hung He stops scratches his head comes up
with an idea then zooms over to ALADDIN He holds
up his hands like a director scoping a picture and
we look through them) Aladdin youve just won
the heart of the princess What are you gonna do
next (ALADDIN looks at him then walks away in
sadness to the bed where he falls on it and sighs
GENIE again is confused then goes to him and pulls
out a script labeled Aladdin Whispering )
Psst your line is Im going to free the genie
Anytime
GenieI cant
Sure you can You just go Genie I wish you
free (He grabs ALADDINs head and uses
him as a mock ventriloquists dummy ALADDIN pulls away
Im serious Look Im sorry--I really am But
they want to make me sultan--no They want to make
Prince Ali sultan Without you Im just Aladdin
Al you won
Because of you The only reason anyone thinks Im
anything is because of you What if they find out
Im not really a prince (Quietly) What if

Jasmine finds out Ill lose her Genie I cant
keep this up on my own I cant wish you free

GENIE (Sarcastically) Hey I understand After all
youve lied to everyone else Hey I was beginning
to feel left out Now if youll excuse me
master (He says the last word in disgust then
poofs back into the lamp)

(ABU and CARPET are watching from the window)

ABU Ohhh

ALADDIN Genie Im really sorry (A tongue comes out of the
spout and raspberries him) Well fine (He slams
a pillow on top of the LAMP) Then just stay in
there (He looks at ABU and CARPET) What are you

sorry Wait Abu-- wait--Im sorry I didnt--

wait cmon (He sighs) What am I doing
Genies right--I gotta tell Jasmine the truth
JASMINE (From a distance) Ali oh Ali--will you come here
ALADDIN (Putting on his turban) Well here goes (He walks
into the garden) Jasmine Where are you

(We see IAGO wearing a beak and standing on stilts next to a FLAMINGO
in the pond He is imitating JASMINEs voice)

IAGO Ahem--In the menagerie hurry
ALADDIN Im coming

(We see ALADDIN hurry past not noticing the birds IAGO laughs
then turns back and looks into the face of a FLAMINGO who is
panting)

FLAMINGO Duh

IAGO Ya got a problem pinky (He sweeps the birds
feet out from under it IAGO runs into the palace
and finds the lamp under the pillow) Boy Jafars
gonna be happy to see you (Stretches his face
like JAFARs and imitates it) Good work Iago
(Normal) Ah go on (JAFAR) No really--on a scale
of one to ten you are an eleven (Normal) Ah
Jafar--youre too kind Im embarrassed Im
blushing (He flies away with the lamp)

(Cut to the palace entrance The SULTAN is standing on top making
an announcement to the people)

SULTAN People of Agrabah My daughter has finally chosen a
suitor

(Cut to behind the curtain where JASMINE is peeking ALADDIN
appears at the bottom of the stairs)

ALADDIN Jasmine
JASMINE Ali where have you been
ALADDIN Theres something Ive got to tell you
JASMINE The whole kingdom has turned out for fathers

announcement

ALADDIN No But Jasmine listen to me please

JASMINE Good luck (She pushes him out onto the platform
with the SULTAN where he overlooks the entire
crowd)

SULTAN Ali Ababwa

ALADDIN Oh boy

(Far above IAGO and JAFAR watch through a window)

IAGO Look at them cheering that little pipsqueak
JAFAR Let them cheer

(He lifts the lamp and rubs it GENIE comes out)

GENIE You know Al Im getting (turns and sees JAFAR)
reallyyyyyy--I dont think youre him (He
descends and consults a playbill) Tonight the
role of Al will be played by a tall dark and
sinister ugly man

JAFAR I am your master now (He throws GENIE to the
ground and puts his foot on GENIEs face)

GENIE I was afraid of that

JAFAR Genie grant me my first wish I wish to rule on
high as sultan

(Cut to ext where dark clouds circle the castle The castle shakes
The roof rips off and the SULTAN and ALADDIN duck)

ALADDIN Whoa
SULTAN Bless my soul What is this What is going on

(His turban lifts off his head When he grabs it his whole body
flies up then is stripped of all his clothing except his boxer
shorts The clothing reappears on JAFAR)

JAFAR Heh heh heh

SULTAN Jafar you vile betrayer

IAGO Thats Sultan Vile Betrayer to you

ALADDIN Oh yeah Well well just see about that (Pulls
off his own turban but finds it empty) The lamp

JAFAR Finders-keepers Abooboo

(They both look up and see a gigantic GENIE lift the palace into
the clouds ALADDIN whistles and CARPET flies up to greet him
They fly up near the GENIEs head)

ALADDIN Genie No

GENIE Sorry kid--I got a new master now (He places the
palace on top of a mountain)

SULTAN Jafar I order you to stop

JAFAR Theres a new order now--my order Finally you
will bow to me

(The SULTAN bows but JASMINE does not)
JAFAR Well never bow to you

IAGO Why am I not surprised
JAFAR If you will not bow before a sultan then you will
cower before a sorcerer (To GENIE) Genie my

second wish--I wish to be the most powerful
sorcerer in the world

(GENIE extends his finger ALADDIN tries to stop him but he cannot
and another GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt strikes JAFAR
returning him to his normal look)

IAGO Ladies and gentlemen a warm Agrabah welcome for
Sorcerer Jafar

JAFAR Now where were we Ah yes--abject humiliation
(He zaps JASMINE and the SULTAN with his staff and
they both bow to him RAJAH comes running at him
He zaps RAJAH and the tiger turns into a kitty-
cat) Down boy Oh princess--(lifts her chin
with his staff)--theres someone Im dying to
introduce you to

ALADDIN (off-camera) Jafar Get your hands off her

(JAFAR zaps ALADDIN CARPET flies away)

JAFAR Prince Ali
Yes it is he
But not as you know him
Read my lips and come to grips
With reality

(JAFAR brings the two of them closer in the air)

Yes meet a blast from your past
Whose lies were too good to last
Say hello to your precious Prince Ali

(JAFAR zaps ALI back to ALADDIN)

IAGO Or should we say Aladdin
ALADDIN Jasmine I tried to tell you

JAFAR So Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin
Just a con need I go on
Take it from me
His personality flaws
Give me adequate cause
To send him packing on a one-way trip
So his prospects take a terminal dip
His assets frozen the venue chosen
Is the ends of the earth whoopee
So long

IAGO Good bye see ya

JAFAR Ex-Prince Ali

(JAFAR has zapped ABU back to normal He sends the two of them into
a tall pillar then launches it like a rocket but not before
CARPET can get in F2B then we see a snowy wasteland where
the pillar crashes and rolls It finally comes to a stop
ALADDIN emerges obviously very cold)

ALADDIN Abu Abu (He looks back at a shivering pile of
snow) Oh this is all my fault--I should have
freed the genie when I had the chance (He digs
out ABU and cradles him inside his vest) Abu
Are you okay Im sorry Abu--I made a mess of
everything somehow I gotta go back and set

things right (He starts to walk through the snow

and he eventuallysteps on a frozen CARPET)

Carpet (He looks up and sees CARPET is pinned by

the pillar He tugs to try and free CARPET He

cant do it so he begins to remove snow from the
base of the pillar) Abu start digging Thats
it (Finally enough snow has been removed and
the pillar begins to roll ALADDIN runs away
looks back then slides into place The pillar
rolls over him and when it is gone ALADDIN and

ABU are left sitting in the patch of snow made by

the window of the pillar) Yeah All right (He

looks up at his turban made out of scared ABU

CARPET shakes off the snow and rushes over to pick

them up) Now back to Agrabah Lets go

(We cut back to ext long shot of Agrabah shrouded in red clouds
Cut to int and slow zoom of throne room IAGO has the SULTAN
tied up like a marionette and JASMINE is chained next to the

throne)
IAGO Puppet ruler want a cracker Heres your cracker
Shove em all right down your throat Here have
lots

(JAFAR pulls the chain and JASMINE walks up to him holding an apple

JAFAR Leave him alone
(IAGO stops for a second then continues)

JAFAR It pains me to see you reduced to this Jasmine
(He takes a bite out of the apple she is holding)
A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be
on the arm of the most powerful man in the world
(He waves his finger and a crown appears) What do
you say my dear Why with you as my queen

(She picks up a glass of wine and throws it in his face)

JASMINE Never
JAFAR Ill teach you some respect (She falls back as he
raises his hand to slap her Then he stops) No

Genie I have decided to make my final wish I
wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in

)
love with me
(We see ALADDIN race back into town)

GENIE (Again as Buckley) Ah master-- there are a few
addendas some quid pro quo-

JAFAR Dont talk back to me you stupid blue lout You
will do what I order you to do slave

(JASMINE looks up and sees ALADDIN in the window motioning her to
play along)

JASMINE (She stands and puts the crown on her head)
Jafar I never realized how incredibly

handsome you are

(The GENIEs jaw drops)

JAFAR Thats better (He pulls the GENIEs jaw up like a
shade) Now pussycat tell me more
aboutmyself

JASMINE Youre tall well dressed

(JAFAR walks over to her ALADDIN jumps down with ABU and GENIE
sees them)

GENIE Al Al little buddy
ALADDIN Shh
GENIE (Literally zips his mouth shut then unzips it)
Al I cant help you--I work for senor psychopath
now (His head turns into JAFARs then back)
ALADDIN Hey--Im a street rat remember (He rezips GENIEs
mouth) Ill improvise

(He slides down a pile of coins and hides close to JAFAR and JASMINE
JAFARs back is to ALADDIN)

JAFAR Go on

JASMINE And your beardis sotwisted (She has her
arms around him She pretends to twist with her
finger but she is actually motioning for ALADDIN
to come over He makes his move IAGO sees him)

IAGO Jaf--mmmmmm (ABU grabs him and covers his mouth)
JAFAR And the street rat
JASMINE What street rat

(They are about to kiss when IAGO manages to knock over a bowl JAFAR
turns to look but JASMINE grabs him back and kisses him ALADDIN
looks disgusted IAGO and ABU both look disgusted)

ABU Yuck

JAFAR That was--(he sees ALADDINs reflection in her
crown) You How many times do I have
to kill you boy
(He zaps ALADDIN JASMINE rushes him and he throws her to the
ground ALADDIN rushes and grabs the staff)

ALADDIN Get the lamp

(JASMINE runs to it JAFAR however shakes off ALADDIN then
zaps her into an hourglass)

JAFAR Ah ah ah princess--Your time is up

(Sand begins to fall from the top onto her)

ALADDIN Jasmine
IAGO Oh nice shot Jaf-- (he is knocked out by ABU)

(ABU rushes for the lamp)

JAFAR Dont toy with me (Hes zapped into a toy monkey
ALADDIN Abu

(CARPET rushes in)

JAFAR Things are unraveling fast now boy (CARPET is
zapped and unravels ALADDIN again rushes for the
lamp) Get the point (His path is blocked by
large swords sticking in the floor JAFAR grabs
the lamp and laughs hideously ALADDIN pulls a
sword out of the floor) Im just getting warmed

up (He breathes a ring of fire around ALADDIN)
ALADDIN Are you afraid to fight me yourself you cowardly
snake
JAFAR A snake am I Perhaps youd like to see how
snake-like I can be (He smiles broadly and we

see a snakes tongue come out from behind his
teeth He then turns into a giant cobra and the
ring of fire around ALADDIN becomes part of the
snake encircling ALADDIN The snake JAFAR makes
moves on ALADDIN and on the third try ALADDIN
swings the sword and hits JAFAR Cut to GENIE
cheerleaders wearing A sweaters)

GENIE Rickem rockem rackem rake--stick that sword into
that snake
JAFAR You stay out of thissss

(GENIE waving a tiny pennant with a J on it

GENIE (Weakly) Jafar Jafar hes our man--if he cant do it
GREAT

(ALADDIN uses the distraction to make a break for the hourglass where
JASMINE is trapped However JAFAR sees this and blocks the path
ALADDIN is thrown away and he loses his sword)

JASMINE Aladdin
(ALADDIN jumps on a large gem and slides across the floor grabbing
the sword on his way He turns a corner but the pursuing snake
cannot and the front half of JAFAR crashes through a wall and
hangs outside the palace ALADDIN jumps up on the snakes back

and stabs it JAFAR screams in agony ALADDIN again tries to
free the princess)

ALADDIN Hang on Jasmine

(He is about to hit the glass with his sword when JAFAR grabs him)

JAFAR (laughs hideously) You little fool You thought
you could defeat the most powerful being on earth
IAGO (with GENIE coming up behind him) Squeeze him

Jafar--Squeeze him like a--awk (GENIE elbows him
out of the way)

JAFAR Without the genie boy youre nothing

ALADDIN (Has an idea) The genie The genie The genie
has more power than youll ever have

JAFAR What

ALADDIN He gave you your power he can take it away

GENIE Al what are you doing Why are you bringing me
into this

ALADDIN Face it Jafar--youre still just second best

JAFAR Youre right His power does exceed my own But
not for long

(JAFAR circles around the GENIE)

GENIE The boy is crazy Hes a little punch drunk One
too many hits with the snake (His hand
turns into a snake and he hits his head with it)

JAFAR Slave I make my third wish I wish to be an all
powerful genie

GENIE (Reluctantly) All right your wish is my command
Way to go Al

(GENIE zaps JAFAR with the last GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt
JAFARs snake form dissipates and he turns into a genie We
see JASMINEs raised hand disappear under the sand ALADDIN
runs over and finally smashes the glass Sand and princess
pour out)

JAFAR Yes Yes The power The absolute power
JASMINE (to ALADDIN) What have you done
ALADDIN Trust me

(A black lamp appears at JAFARs base JAFAR is busy conjuring)

JAFAR The universe is mine to command to control

ALADDIN Not so fast Jafar Arent you forgetting something
(JAFAR looks down questioningly) You wanted to be a genie you
got it And everything that goes with it

(Shackles appear on JAFARs wrists)
JAFAR No No
TAGO Im gettin out of here Come on youre the
genie I dont want--

(IAGO tries to fly away but is sucked in with JAFAR)

ALADDIN Phenomenal cosmic powers Itty bitty living space
GENIE Al you little genius you

(ABU turns back to normal the CARPET re-ravels JASMINE the SULTAN
and RAJAH are standing together RAJAH jumps up into the arms of
the SULTAN then they are all transformed The SULTAN is crushed
because of the weight of the new RAJAH The palace reappears
where it used to be in the city ALADDIN is left holding the
new lamp)

JAFAR (Both from inside the lamp) Get your blasted beak
out of my face

TAGO Oh shut up you moron

JAFAR Dont tell me to shut up

GENIE Allow me (He takes the lamp and goes to the

balcony He is now wearing a baseball cap He
winds up as if to throw the lamp but opens his
palm flat and flicks it out into the desert

with his finger) Ten- thousand years in a cave of
wonders ought to chill him out

(JAFAR and IAGO continue to argue as they fade out JASMINE walks
over to ALADDIN They hold hands but both look sad)

ALADDIN Jasmine Im sorry I lied to you about being a
prince

JASMINE I know why you did

ALADDIN Well I guessthis is goodbye (GENIE pokes
his head around the corner shocked at what he is
hearing)

JASMINE Oh that stupid law This isnt fair--I love you

GENIE (Wipes away a tear) Al no problem Youve still

got one wish left Just say the word and youre a
prince again

ALADDIN But Genie what about your freedom
GENIE Hey its only an eternity of servitude This is
love (He leans down next to her) Al youre

not gonna find another girl like her in a million
years Believe me I know Ive looked

ALADDIN Jasmine I do love you but Ive got to stop
pretending to be something Im not
JASMINE I understand

(They take one final look into each others eyes then ALADDIN turns
to the GENIE)

ALADDIN Genie I wish for your freedom
GENIE One bona fide prince pedigree coming up I--what
ALADDIN (He holds the lamp up to GENIE) Genie youre
free

(A transformation scene ensues in which the shackles fall off
GENIEs wrist and the lamp falls uselessly to the ground
GENIE picks it up and looks at it)

GENIE (He cant believe it) Heh heh Im free Im
free (He hands the lamp to ALADDIN) Quick
quick wish for something outrageous Say I want
the Nile Wish for the Nile Try that

ALADDIN I wish for the Nile

GENIE No way (Laughs hysterically He bounces around
the balcony like a pinball) Oh does that feel

good Im free Im free at last Im hittin
the road Im off to see the world I--

(He is packing a suitcase but looks down and sees ALADDIN looking
very sad)

ALADDIN Genie Im--Im gonna miss you
GENIE Me too Al No matter what anybody says youll
always be a prince to me

(They hug The SULTAN steps forward)

SULTAN Thats right Youve certainly proven your worth
as far as Im concerned Its that law thats the
problem

JASMINE Father

SULTAN Well am I sultan or am I sultan From this day
forth the princess shall marry whomever she deems

worthy

JASMINE (She smiles widely and runs into ALADDINs arms)
Him I chooseI choose you Aladdin

ALADDIN Ha ha Call me Al

(They are about to kiss when giant blue hands pull everybody together
GENIE is decked out in a Hawaiian shirt with golf clubs and a Goofy
hat)

GENIE Oh all of ya Come over here Big group hug
Mind if I kiss the monkey (He kisses ABU) Ooh
hairball Well I cant do any more damage around
this popsicle stand Im outta here Bye bye
you two crazy lovebirds Hey Rugman ciao Im
history No Im mythology No I dont care
what I am--Im free

(The GENIE flies up into the blue sky leaving a trail of sparkles
behind him They cut (a jump cut to make matters worse)
to fireworks exploding over a nightscape We tilt down and see
ALADDIN and JASMINE flying on CARPET)

ALADDIN A whole new world
JASMINE A whole new life
BOTH (with off-camera chorus) For you and me
MENS CHORUS A whole new world

(They fly off into the moonlight and after they have disappeared
the moon turns and reveals the GENIEs laughing face Suddenly
the film is grabbed off the projector the GENIE lifts it up

and looks at the audience)

GENIE Made ya look

(Drops the film back to normal with the normal moon Fade to black
The end)
