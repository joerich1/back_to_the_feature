INT BANK DINING ROOM - NIGHT
In MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT we see three men sitting at the table
COLONEL SMITHERS at the head of the table M on the left and
Bond on the right Each has a brandy snifter in front of him

and there is a decanter in front of Smithers M takes a
sip

A servant BRUNSKILL walks over holding a cigar box He
offers it to M who takes a cigar then crosses behind Bond
and offers it but Bond waves him off

At the same time we PULL BACK across the extremely long table
until we see a candelabra at each end and an end table in fg

SMITHERS
We here at the Bank of England
Mister Bond are the official
depository for gold bullion just as
Fort Knox Kentucky is for the
United States We know of course
the amounts we each hold we know
the amounts deposited in other
banks and we can estimate what is
being held for industrial purposes
This enables the two governments to
establish respectively the true
value of the dollar and the pound
Consequently we are vitally
concerned with unauthorized
leakages

BOND
I take it you mean

TWO-SHOT - BOND AND SMITHERS

BOND
smuggling

SMITHERS
Yes

Brunskill holds the box out to Smithers and he takes a cigar
then hands it back so Brunskill can clip its end Meanwhile
M off-screen lights his cigar and blows out a puff of smoke

SMITHERS
Gold gentlemen which has been
melted down and recast is
virtually untraceable which makes
it uh unlike diamonds ideal for
smuggling attracting the biggest
and most ingenious criminals

Brunskill bowing slightly hands Smithers the clipped cigar

SMITHERS
Thank you Brunskill That will be
all

BRUNSKILL

Thank you sir

Brunskill exits Smithers picks up the decanter and hands it
to Bond
SMITHERS
Have a little more of this uh
rather disappointing brandy

gold bullion on deposit in Zurich
Amsterdam Caracas and Hong Kong
worth twenty million pounds Most
of it comes from this country

Bond passes him the decanter

BOND
Well why move it

Smithers passes the decanter to M

SMITHERS
Because the price of gold varies
from country to country If you
buy it here at thirty dollars an
ounce you can sell it in say
Pakistan at a hundred and ten
dollars and triple your money

You disappoint me Goldfinger You
know Operation Grand Slam simply
wont work Incidentally Delta

GOLDFINGER
You are unusually well informed
Mr Bond

The servant approaches with Bonds drink on a tray

BOND
Youll kill sixty-thousand people
uselessly
(to servant)
Ah

He takes his drink The servant moves off Kisch though
lingers behind them

INTERCUT - BOND AND GOLDFINGER

GOLDFINGER
American motorists kill that many
every two years

BOND

Yes well Ive worked out a few
statistics of my own

(sits across the

table from him)
Fifteen billion dollars in gold
bullion weighs ten thousand five
hundred tons Sixty men would take
twelve days to load it onto two
hundred trucks Now at the most
youre going to have two hours
before the army navy air force
marines move in and make you put it
back

GOLDFINGER
Who mentioned anything about
removing it

Bond stops drinking Kisch leans back against a pillar behind
them watching
GOLDFINGER
Is the julep tart enough for you

BOND
(thinking)
You plan to break into the worlds
largest bank but not to steal
anything Why

GOLDFINGER
Go on Mister Bond

BOND
Mister Ling the Red Chinese agent
at the factory Hes a specialist
in nuclear fission -- But of
course

Goldfinger smiles back at him

BOND
His governments given you a bomb

GOLDFINGER
I prefer to call it an atomic
device Its small but
particularly dirty

BOND
Cobalt and iodine

GOLDFINGER
Precisely

BOND

Well if you explode it in Fort
Knox the uh entire gold supply
of the United States will be
radioactive for fifty-seven
years

GOLDFINGER
Fifty-eight to be exact

BOND
I apologize Goldfinger Its an
inspired deal They get what they
want -- economic chaos in the West
-- and the value of your gold
increases many times

GOLDFINGER
I conservatively estimate ten
times
BOND
Brilliant But the atomic device
as you call it is already
obviously in this country

GOLDFINGER
Obviously

BOND
But bringing it to Fort Knox uh
undetected could be risky -- very
risky

GOLDFINGER
Oh the contrary Mister Bond The
risk is all on your side If the
authorities should attempt to

locate it who knows where it might
be exploded eh Perhaps the
Polaris submarine pens at New
London Cape Kennedy near the
White House But we are
speculating idly Operation Grand
Slam will be successful You will
be there to see for yourself -- to
closely for comfort Im afraid
