SINGER (0S)

(sings )
Way down in Missouri when I heard
this melody
When I was just a little baby on my
mama’s knee
The old folks were humming the
banjos were strumming
So sweet and low
Hushabye my baby go to sleep on
mama’s knee
Journey back to these old hills in
dreams again with me
It seems like your mama was there
once again
And the old folks were strumming
that same old refrain

Ashlee helps her sister REE 17 hang laundry Ree buttons
Ashlee’s doll’s dress hands it to her sister and then picks
up the full laundry basket

SINGER (0S)

(sings )
Way down in Missouri where I heard
this lullaby
When the stars were blinking and
the moon was shining high
and I hear mama calling as in days
long ago
Singing hushabye

REE
Let’s go

couples play cards

MARIDETH

(sings )
As I look on that valley far below
It’s green as far as I can see
As my memories return oh how my
heart does yearn
For you and the days that used to
be
High on a mountain wind blowing
free
I wonder if you still remember me

Play it through

Ree and Gail (with baby carrier) knock at the door
April gets up to answer their knock

Or has time erased your memory
As I listen to the breeze whisper
gently through the trees
I wonder if you still remember me

to Ree He grasps her chin and examines her bloody face
shooting a look at Merab

Thump Milton walks back into the barn flanked by Ray and
Bobby He stops within an arm’s length of Teardrop

TEARDROP
What Jessup done was against our
ways he knew it I know it and I
ain’t raised no stink at all about
whatever became of him But she
ain’t my brother

Teardrop looks around the gathering finally locking eyes
with Ree before concluding his case

now and carrying her on out of here
to home That suit you Thump

THUMP MILTON

on me

Ree registers the gravity of this commitment on Teardrop’s
part

THUMP MILTON
She’s now yours to answer for

TEARDROP
This is a girl who ain’t gonna tell
nobody nothing

INT SCHOOL ROTC CLASSROOM - DAY

Army recruiter SGT SCHALK 30’s rises to shake hands with a
student who he has just interviewed

SGT SCHALK
It was nice meeting you Have a
good day OK

STUDENT
Thanks

Sgt Schalk beckons Ree over

SGT SCHALK
Hi how are you doing Sergeant
Schalk

REE
Ree Dolly

SGT SCHALK
Nice to meet you So what brought
you down here today Ree

REE
I wanted to find out more about the
forty thousand dollars I get for
signing up

SGT SCHALK
Well that’s a good reason for
joining but why don’t you give me
three better reasons for joining
(MORE)
SGT SCHALK (contd)
Because once you join up there’s
no turning back and it might not
be worth forty thousand dollars to
you

REE
Well the main reason is I need the
money It’d be nice to travel I
suppose

SGT SCHALK
You know five years is a long
commitment

REE
Well how long before I get the
money

SGT SCHALK
Well after you sign up it would be
anywhere between fourteen weeks to
eighty-two weeks

REE
Well how come it doesn’t say that
on the poster

SGT SCHALK

Probably a clerical error or it
just wasn’t on there It might
have been in fine print at the
bottom Do you mind me asking
what happened to your eye and your
lip

REE
I fell off my bike

SGT SCHALK
Fell off a bike Well um how old
are you

REE
Seventeen

SGT SCHALK
You’re seventeen OK Now if
this is something you really wanted
to do we’d have to bring Mom and
Dad in on this OK

REE
I can sign for myself

SGT SCHALK

Not at seventeen you can’t At
seventeen you’re still considered a
minor by the U S Government OK
You have to be eighteen to sign up
Would it be a problem getting Mom
and Dad in here I mean I can
come out to you guys’ house and-

REE
My mom’s sick My dad’s gone

SGT SCHALK
Well do you have any brothers or
sisters that might be able to help

REE
I got a little brother and a little
sister twelve and six

SGT SCHALK
Well who’s taking care of them
right now

REE
I am

SGT SCHALK
You are Is that why you need the
forty thousand dollars

REE
Yes sir

SGT SCHALK
Well it sounds like it might be a
bigger challenge just to stay home
you know and actually take care of
your brother and sister Because
you know you’re not going to be
able to take them with you to
training right

REE
I thought maybe I could

SGT SCHALK

Not right at the beginning Plus
you wouldn’t be able to have them
when you’re actually in the active
duty army Because who’s going to
be there to take care of them if
you have to go off and actually
fight

Ree falls silent

SGT SCHALK (CONTD)
So it sounds like right now you
need to buckle up and stay home
It’s going to take a lot of
backbone and a lot of courage to
stay home but that I think is what
you need to do right at this point
OK Now something might change
here in the next year or so You
might decide this is what you want
to do you know But don’t take it
lightly and don’t do it just for
the money You need to have a good
reason to do this OK

REE
OK

SGT SCHALK
Alright Well it was nice meeting

you

REE
Nice meeting you

SGT SCHALK
Have a good day OK

REE
Thank you

to Alice

leads the group through the gathering darkness to the edge of
a pond Cows moo plaintively The sisters pull a rowboat
from the underbrush No one speaks Merab Alice and Ree
get in Kat puts the chainsaw in the boat and Merab paddles
away from shore towards a tangle of branches in the middle of
the pond

MERAB
He should be right there You’re
gonna need to reach down and tug
him up

Ree removes her coat and rolls up her sleeves She
hesitates

MERAB
He ain’t deep

Ree plunges her arm into the pond groping in the water

MERAB
Straight down Can you feel of
him

Ree shivers feels something and gasps recoiling Merab
shines a light on the water as Ree goes back in horrified
but determined grabbing a firm hold of an icy hand

MERAB
Alright now take this

Merab lifts the chainsaw to Ree

REE
What

MERAB
Well how else you gonna get his
hands

ALICE
Oh come on child Your daddy
would want you to do this Now

Ree looks to Merab and away making no move to take the
chainsaw

ALICE
She can’t do it Merab

Merab sees that Alice is right

MERAB
Hold his arm out straight child

Merab starts the saw and begins to cut

Ree sobs She drops the severed hand in the boat Her
father’s body sinks away from her grasp

MERAB
Why’d you let go You’re gonna need
both hands or sure as shit they’1l
say he cut one off to keep from
going to prison They know that
trick Now reach back down in
there now - quick

Ree reaches back into the pond She grabs hold of Jessup’s
body again and hangs on Merab revs the chainsaw and severs
the second hand
Ree is stunned Merab wraps her coat around her
