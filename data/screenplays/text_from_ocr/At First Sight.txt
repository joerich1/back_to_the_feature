AT FIRST SIGHT
EXT VALLEY - DUSK
Gold light dappling across a valley that seems
to reach on forever We ease back revealing
more - taking in the visual feast - finally
discovering a seated figure facing out over
the valley - a DOG at his feet
VIRGIL ANDERSON life ahead of him - someone
seemingly at ease with himself As we watch
him a moment - SOUNDS become prominent -
whistle of the wind through the grass - a
birds wings as it takes flight - a tree
branch creaking under its own weight And as
he sits there listening we see the last rays
of sunlight slip from the day
BLACK - and our TITLES come up
Then out of the darkness come a pair of
HEADLIGHTS - and were

HER POV - A small iced over pond - and in the
middle - moving about is Virgil ICE SKATING -
hockey stick in hand - moving about the rink
with an imaginary puck

AMY (0OS)
(distracted)
Yes I took the first

Virgil winds up and takes a slap at the ice
with his stick - throws his hands up in the
air like he just scored
Amy smiles peers off down the road A sign

Virgil has his back to us as he prepares the
table The room is very ordered - every vial
bottle towel has its exact spot
VIRGIL
Hey Amy Im Virgil - why
dont you get ready - hop
up on the table
Amy sees Virgil - his head turned slightly
away - she drops her sweats and lies on the
table face down - pulling the sheet to cover
herself

AMY
Sounds like youre a genius
at this

VIRGIL

(laughs)
Thats right Mozart
Einstein Virgil Anderson
massage therapist Now Im

we hear the soulful aria Mira 0 Norma from
Bellinis Norma
VIRGIL
First time in Pinecrest
AMY
Came in late last night
missed the town completely
VIRGIL
If you came in broad
daylight you could still
miss the town completely
Slow moving cuts of Virgil working long
strokes over Amys body - - his hands
gracefully LENGTHENING and STRETCHING her

muscles
VIRGIL
Too much compute work
AMY
Uh-huh
VIRGIL

Bad chair - you should
think about a change

AMY
(quiet)
Absolutely

Virgil reaches his hands all the way down her
spine and makes a move that causes Amy to
release a very deep guttural sound

VIRGIL
Too deep

AMY
No just right

Amy is now lost in another world - as Virgil
shifts - working gently - not caressing - but

molding - like a sculptor

A moment and Amy surprisingly

begins to cry

- softly Virgil stops - takes a step back

She cries
breath

VIRGIL
I - Im sorry - it was too
deep

for another few beats - then takes a

AMY
No - it Its not you
Its just things have kinda
built up I dont know why
Im crying look this is
embarrassing

VIRGIL
Dont be embarrassed - you

VIRGIL
Not since grade school Im

minute

VIRGIL

DISSOLVE
TO
Virgil sits next to her - then reaches out -
takes her hand and starts a slow comforting
massage - we see Amy visibly relax
AMY
You ever feel like a
Martians invaded your
entire body
VIRGIL
Every day
Amy closes her eyes - smiling slightly in
thanks

CAROLINE (0OS)
(laughing)
Quite a compliment Virgil

VIRGIL (0S)

Amy looks down the hall - sees a glimpse of
Virgil rounding the corner She chases after
hin into the reception area where she sees
him exiting the door and moving of f down the
driveway
AMY
Virgil - wait
Hes gone Hopping along tugging on her last
sandal - she decides to go after him -
fighting her way through a large tour group
just checking in
EXT BEAR MTN SPA - LATE DAY
Virgil in the distance moving his way towards
the main street Amy exiting the building -
trying not to slip on the ice as she hurries
after him - trying to get close enough to call
out
Virgil stops at a main roadway as Amy comes up
behind him
AMY
Virgil hey
Virgil turns - sunglasses on - looks directly
at Amy

VIRGIL
Yes
AMY
Its Amy - Amy Tremont
VIRGIL
Of course - you were

But I loved to skate as a
kid - unfortunately I have
two left feet
VIRGIL
(playing with her)
They look perfectly OK with
me
Amy laughs starts relaxing - unconsciously
starts to flirt Head cocked shifts her
weight on one foot moving slightly closer

AMY
I love the view you get
here

VIRGIL

Same here - I never get
used to it
Just then a YELLOW SCHOOL BUS pulls up in
front of him and WHOOSH the doors pop open
revealing CARL KIPLING black a hundred years
old Virgil turns as a few kids pile off the
bus
VIRGIL
Well this is my ride Hey
Tommy my man
And with his hand extended a kid high fives
it Amy looks up - a BUS full of young school
kids Seems odd
TOMMY
Virge
As the kid moves off
AMY
Well I just wanted to

was just in a weird place
VIRGIL
And now
AMY
Now Im fine - so I wanted

VIRGIL
For making you cry
AMY

VIRGIL

Virgil starts towards the bus reaching behind
to his pack Pulls something out
VIRGIL

in his hand And he taps his way to the bus

AMY
See you oh my God

VIRGIL

VIRGIL

(smile)

Hey you already apologized
once - no need to overdo

it Bye now
Amy doesnt know how to respond And he moves
into the front seat of the bus - amongst Hey
Virgils from the school kids and Ca-chunk
the doors close - the Yellow Bus steaming off
- past Amy as she stares at Virgil in the
front seat - about to wave to him - then
realizing he wouldnt see
As she turns and watches the bus move off down
the street - a hand comes out - Virgils - and
waves good-bye
EXT VIRGILS HOME- DUSK
The BUS stopping in front of Virgils home - a
side-by-side DUPLEX at the edge of surrounding
woods
Virgil steps into the street and with a HONK
the bus pulls away He turns grazes his hand

across a tree out front - and starts towards
his home
AT THE PORCH - he hesitates at the first door
Finds it with his hand - then raps on it
No answer He moves over to his own door - and
goes inside
INT VIRGILS HOME - EVENING
As he enters Sophie an aging LAB lays on
the couch
VIRGIL
Get of f the couch Sophie
As the dog slides guiltily off the couch

Some seeing eye dog - more
like sleeping eye dog
Virgil bends down as he passes the coffee
table to pick up the REMOTE CONTROL placed
just so Click - a Game Show pops on
VIRGIL
Met a girl today - nice
voice - followed me out of
the building
Sophie barks
VIRGIL
No she wasnt a stalker
CLOSE ON Virgils hand flipping open a large
book marked TV HOCKEY SCHEDULE - its

JENNIE (0S)
Sophies just worried about

horror movies
In the kitchen JENNIE ANDERSON older than
Virgil simply dressed putting a just made
dinner carefully onto a plate
VIRGIL
Hey youre here - so how

Running his hand down the pure white page - he
finds what he wants BAP - he hits the channel
changer and the game comes on
JENNIE
The usual - need a lot of
attention So whos the
girl
Moving into the kitchen Virgil puts the
remote to the side of the refrigerator where
it VELCRO sticks to an exact spot

VIRGIL
From the spa I made her
cry

JENNIE

VIRGIL JENNIE

a glass Back to the fridge he grabs a coke
JENNIE

spot on a coffee table (facing away from the
TV)
JENNIE
(laughs)
One day Im going to switch
them on you
VIRGIL
And one day Ill play
forward for the New York

Four precise steps into the room and Virgil
plops down on the sofa - finds his fork
Jennie moves to a counter where a pile of
school books sit

JENNIE
Ha - ha You need new jokes
VIRGIL
Or a new sister
JENNIE

Picking up the books she moves past Virgil -
pecks him on the head and moves to the door

VIRGIL
You want to watch some
hockey

JENNIE

(at the door)
You want to grade some
spelling tests
(beat)

She leaves and Virgil pats the couch and
Sophie hops up next to him
VIRGIL
You know this girl - for
one moment - she actually
thought I could
(Sophie grumbles as
she settles in)
Im not kidding
(beat)
And she had this great

voice - relaxing - soft
like a breeze through
(beat)

Wonder what she thinks
about blind dates
INT AMYS ROOM - EVENING
Amy in bed - just out of the shower - the only
light in the room comes from the TV She has
the remote mindlessly switching channels -
not staying on one for more than a second or
two
Click - an Odd Couple rerun - click - ESPN
bowling - click - Three Stooges - Moe poking
Curly in the eye - click - click - click
Bored she stops - notices a small scarf ona

it against her eyes and ties it tight around
her head
She stands - hands out in front of her -
starts to walk across the room - not so bad -
WHAM - right into a side table Shit that

As Amy starts to get changed in the bathroom
VIRGIL
Anyways I was in the

VIRGIL

Great - Im blind and

youre deaf - what a pair

A few store windows lit up Some people eating
dinner at a streetside cafe Virgil holding
Amys arm as they walk down the street
WITH AMY AND VIRGIL WALKING

VIRGIL
the Mechanic at the top

of the street is Doug -

smokes too much - but a

good guy Three steps down

is Carlsons hardware -

hes got a laugh like a

donkey - we sometimes

listen to games together -

hes a Devils fan And

just up ahead should be

Gradys junk shop - he

calls it antiques

Smells like junk Id hate

to see what it looks like
A woman bustles past NANCY BENDER weighed
down with groceries

VIRGIL
(intuitively)

Hey Nancy
NANCY

in for you

VIRGIL
Nancys our librarian
brings in any braille book

(to Amy)

The guys nuts about the
pyramids - anything he can

Nancy laughs - as she moves off
AMY
Nice place - you seem to
know everyone here
VIRGIL
Moved here when I was
eight My family figured it
would be a good place for
me to grow up Tell me what
you see
AMY
Well theres a good
structure to the town -
genuine lines good use of
space To be honest Id
find a better balance to a
lot of these buildings But
thats me
VIRGIL
Whats you
AMY
The architect in me - cant
leave well enough alone
Art school in college - I
made the arms for the Venus
DeMilo
(realizing he
probably doesnt
understand)

no arms and
VIRGIL
(laughs)
I know the Venus De Milo
has no arms and the Mona
Lisa has this captivating
smile and David doesnt
wear a fig leaf
AMY
How do you
VIRGIL
I may not have been a lot
of places - but I read
about things then make an

image up here -- (points to
his head) --that works for
me

Grazing his hand across a telephone pole -
Virgil stops - turns to Amy
VIRGIL
This is the end of the
street We should turn
back
AMY
What about past the end of
the street Whats out
there
He turns around
VIRGIL
(shrugs)
Nothing
AMY
No - theres an old run
down building off to the
side
VIRGIL
Must be the old firehouse
It had a fire so they shut
it down (Amy laughs)
Honest to God
(intrigued)
What else do you see
AMY
A wall of shrubs - a field
with an interesting
configuration of trees
The wind has picked up a bit
VIRGIL
Tell me how you see it
AMY
(enjoying the game)
OK sure Lets see - long
and elegant Like -- like a
woman dancing with two
lovers trying to decide
which one she loves
Virgil stops a moment - takes in the image

AMY
What
VIRGIL
Its just - the image you
just gave me - Dancing
trees - I like that
Virgil stops - his head cocks slightly
VIRGIL

We should go - its
starting to rain
AMY
(looking around)
Theres a bit of a breeze
but--
KABOOM - thunder - and the rain just drops
INT FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
They run in laughing - Amy closing the door
behind them as Virgil moves his way into the
center of the room - stands where the
moonlight from a high window hits the floor
Water runs down the outside glass causing the
light to ripple across him The room is empty
- almost surreal
AMY
I cant believe how fast it
happens
(she sees Virgil -
his head cocked
towards the
ceiling)
AMY
Virgil
Virgils head turns toward her
VIRGIL
You like rain - I love the
rain
AMY
(moving to him)
What were you just doing
there
Virgil slowly moves his head about sensing
the room
VIRGIL
Listening - the rain - it
brings out the contours of
everything gives life toa
room I cant see
WE SEE SLOW MOVING CUTS of the building as
Virgil describes what he hears
VIRGIL
You hear iton the roof
dripping down the walls on
every side On the right
on the drainpipe its
drumming with a deeper
steadier sound - - like a
timpani - echoing across
the room - tells me the
room is large - open You
feel it - in your chest On
the left the rain says
(he listens) a fire
e
r

scape with its own

ythm - ping - ping Then
isten - there

(he points)
--whats that - over

there
AMY
Looks like its
VIRGIL

No listen for it - not

what it looks like - what

it becomes Come here
Amy moves closer - Virgil puts his hands out
on her shoulders - turns her to the sound

VIRGIL

Now just listen to it -

shut out everything but

that sound - do you hear

it

Amy strains to listen - closes her eyes - her
head instinctively turning - no in unison with
Virgils
AMY
Yes - there - its soft -
like a shimmer
VIRGIL
The wind blowing the rain
against a window
AMY
(smile)
Like a cymbal Its like
our own percussive
symphony isnt it
Amy opens her eyes - looks about the room -
listening
VIRGIL
The world is invisible to
me - with my touch it comes
alive But only one thing
at a time But when its
raining I feel everything
at once Sometimes I wish
it could rain inside rain
all around us

AMY
(musing)
Einfuehlung
VIRGIL
What
AMY

Einfuehlung - its an
architectural term It
means to share an empathy
Been a long time since I
felt that
And as they stand listening to the rain
playing its music - Amy watches him -
fascinated by him - then shivers slightly
VIRGIL
Youre cold we should go
AMY
No Im fine really It
was just something passing
through me - cant explain
it - a good thing
Amy smiles at him - then quietly realizes he
cant see it She moves close her hand
reaching out and taking his
AMY
What you just showed me
how I feel - makes me
smile
She takes his hand - hesitates - then puts it
on the side of her face
VIRGIL
I see it now Thank-you
We hold a beat - enjoying the symphony of rain
- then cut to
EXT BEAR MTN LODGE - MORNING
The sun warming the cool morning air The
school bus pulling away to reveal Virgil
making his way into work
VIRGIL (VO)

I thought after yesterday

table again
INT MASSAGE ROOM - NEXT DAY
Amy on the table Virgil squirting oil in his
hand - preparing
AMY
You kidding today Im
looking for a complete
nervous breakdown
VIRGIL
I love a challenge

And as he places his pa
back - working her back
play quietly in the bac

ms carefully on her
slowly we hear opera
ground

Virgils hands on the small of her back -
something amazingly sensual about how he works
her muscles Amy speaks to him in low tones -
in a state of complete relaxation
AMY
Can I ask how long youve
been blind
VIRGIL
Of course most people
avoid the subject You tell
them youre blind and they
act surprised Youre
blind Reallv I didnt
know - you hide it so
well And then they wave
their hand in front of your
face just to make sure
(beat)
It started when I was a
little over a year old
Virgils hands move down Amys sides - slow -
feeling each contour - the oil making her skin
glisten Amy moves her head slightly with his
touch She lets out a small breath of air
AMY
(quiet)
You see shadows
VIRGIL
No Congenital cataracts
And a case of retinitis
pigmentosa thrown in for
good measure This area
needs to loosen up

DISSOLVE
TO
AMY
I think youre doing it
(beat)
No bright lights nothing
VIRGIL
Im blind as a bat
Actually blinder cause
they emit sonar all the
time I dont have a sixth
sense I just dont have
the fifth one I cant hear
things in Vermont cant
smell if youre mad at me
and no - I dont know
Helen Keller Ray Charles
or Stevie Wonder
Amy murmurs in response to Virgils touch
VIRGIL
You say something
AMY
No I just - this feels
nice - too nice
Virgil moves his hands down her back -
sensually kneading each muscle Its clear
hes enjoying this as much as she is
AMY
Youre very good at what
you do
Another breath exhales from her involuntarily
as Virgil hits a sensitive spot

VIRGIL
Thank-you

AMY
You enjoy it

VIRGIL

At times Some clients make
it more enjoyable than
others
Virgil now works down her thighs - Amys back
arching slightly with the movement - both of
them heating to the moment Both their breaths
quickening
AMY
And this client
VIRGIL
Is very very
DING - and the spell is broken
AMY
What
VIRGIL
Sorry - its time Ive got
Mr Ketchum coming in next
- all two hundred pounds
Sorry - I felt like we were
just getting started
Amy sits up on the table - the sheet pulling
away slightly revealing her For a moment she
watches him - his head turned towards her -
but not seeing Then she slowly pulls the
sheet up covering herself
AMY
Thank-you For last night
as well - love to do it
again
VIRGIL
How about I cook dinner
then tonight
AMY

Virgil hangs up the phone - frustrated he
reaches for the frying pan - and promptly
burns his hand
VIRGIL
-DAMN IT
Dropping the pan - Sophie goes scurrying as
he kicks at it - sending it across the room
He turns - thrusts his hand under the sink -
turning on the cold water

What I just want to know a

little more about whats

wrong with him

BETSY
(pause)
Amy Friend to friend
AMY
Shoot
BETSY

I hate to admit it but I
agree with Duncan on this

one
AMY
(back to the
computer)
Dont shoot
BETSY

He makes sense sometimes

My father had a problem a

few years back with severe
cataracts Do you have any
idea what youre getting

into

Amy spins in her chair - looks to Betsy
AMY
You ever listened to rain -
I mean really listened
BETSY
This like that smell the
roses thing
AMY
(turns to her)
Ive spent the last five
years of my adult life with
a man who has the emotional
content of a soap dish The
only time I saw him cry was
doing our tax return three
years ago
(beat)
I need more than that
Betsy For once in a long
long time I feel like I can
breathe again Just the way
he touches me I know I
found someone I can connect
with
BETSY
Ah here we go
AMY
No no I can tell hes
sensing everything about me
with a simple touch He
listens to my every word as
if its the only sound on
the planet - I feel like
even though he cant see
me he knows everything
about me He just moves me
- does that sound crazy
BETSY
(beat)
Does he have a brother
EXT PINE CREST MOUNTAINS - LATE DAY
The FROZEN POND nestled against a strand of
pine Virgil skates fast across the ice
enjoying the speed - the wind using his hockey
stick as a guide - he nears the edge of pond -
feels it with the stick and slams to a stop
He shuffles his body around to face in the
other direction - then starts skating again -
passing AMY standing on the snow covered bank
ON AMY - smiling watching Virgil - enjoying
his release of energy
HER POV - VIRGIL - skating well a look of
relaxation weve never seen on his face He
skates in an arc coming back past Amy
Finally she speaks

AMY
Wayne Gretzky look out
Virgil slams to a halt in surprise - nearly
toppling over
AMY
Sorry -- sorry Didnt mean
to scare you

VIRGIL
Amy
AMY
I said Id come back
VIRGIL
How long how long have
you been
AMY

Watching you Just got here
- couldnt find you at the
spa - took a chance youd
be here Youre very good
VIRGIL
Skated since I was a kid
My dad taught me - wanted
me to play pro one day How
do you like my pond
AMY
Its beautiful
VIRGIL
Describe it for me
AMY
OK Lets see Like cool
blue silk - you know blue
VIRGIL
I think so - keep going
AMY
Blue silk stretched tight
across a bowl - surrounded
by white jacketed sentries
of trees on the horizon
protecting it from the
outside world

VIRGIL
Horizons a tough one

AMY
What

VIRGIL

Never understood horizon -
if touch it - dont know
what it thats OK I liked
the rest of picture
(he starts moving
towards her)
You want to skate
AMY
Sorry I didnt bring my
skates
VIRGIL
Dont need them Come on
step hold of my stick
AMY
Excuse me
VIRGIL
(smile)
Hockey stick Here
He holds the stick out like a cross bar Amy
moves cautiously forward and takes hold of it
VIRGIL
OK Now hold on for
balance I used to do this
with Jennie when we were
kids
And Virgil starts skating backwards pulling
Amy with him Amy is apprehensive at first
then starts to enjoy the movement - the
sensation - both of them laughing out loud
WIDE as we see them move about the rink - Amy
sliding and being pulled by Virgil As he
picks up speed we hear Amy scream in delight
AMY
Look out - were running
out of ice
Virgil turns expertly arcing around the edge
of the ice but Amy loses her nerve - and
balance - and lets go of the stick and goes
flying into an embankment The momentum
carries Virgil off down the ice - both of them
laughing hysterically
VIRGIL
You OK
AMY
Fine Never been dumped so
fast in my life
VIRGIL
Me dump you No way Stay
where you are - Ill come
to you - just keep talking
Amy sits up on her elbows in the embankment
AMY
What do I say
Virgil starts gliding across the ice searching
for Amy
VIRGIL
(hearing her voice
veering in her
direction)
Anything - howd you become
an architect
AMY
God - lets see - I was in
college - art school - a
little aimless - and I met
this guy - an architect -
opened up a new world to
me I liked the structure
the control - finding
problems coming up with
solutions - when I
graduated - we started a
company together - on
impulse got married - which

was crazy - divorced a year
ago - but were still
partners which must seem

even crazier
And Virgils suddenly there - going a little
too far - tumbling off the pond and into her

VIRGIL

Youd think I meant to do

that A patented move
Theyre close - in the snow together - face to
face

AMY
(Amy smiles
realizes)
This is tough
VIRGIL
What
AMY

I bat my eyelashes toss my
head just right and
theres this very sexy
thing I do with my eyes -
then realize none of it
matters to you
VIRGIL
It doesnt matter Tell me
what you look like

AMY
I 1 dont know Im
VIRGIL

Wait Let me
He puts his hand out over her face --
hesitates then slowly feels down the contours
of her cheek her eyelids the shape of her
lips - Amy moving with the touch the
sensuality of it - and as he continues - Amys
hand reaches up - touching his face - Virgil
smiles

VIRGIL
Eyes mouth chin cheek
you are very beautiful
AMY

Thank-you So are you -

more than I could describe
Virgils hands move down her face - closing
her eyes - letting her just experience his
touch - his exploring
And as both their hands continue enjoying the
sensation of discovering each other - Amy
leans forward her eyes still closed finding
his mouth - grazing his lips with her own -
softly gently then they fold into each
others arms locked into a warm deep kiss
INT VIRGILS HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Its dark - a pale moonglow highlights the two
intertwined naked bodies A fire burns in the
background In flowing CUTS we see them make
love
Virgil - his head tilted down - Amy - puts her
hand to his chin - lifts his head - then
kisses each of his closed eyelids in rhythm
with Virgils movements
Amy - now astride Virgil - she closes her eyes
- feels it the way Virgil would - moving
faster now - in total rhythm - shuddering in
mutual release -- and she collapses on top of
him - a deep breath and she rolls over -
cuddles into his arm
A long beat - out of breath
AMY
So -- thats what a blind
date is
They breathe - then both start laughing -
quietly - then hysterically together as Virgil
wraps her up in his arms - holding her
tightly
EXT PINECREST - DAWN
The horizon The sun cresting it - bringing a
new light to the day
INT VIRGILS HOME - EARLY MORNING SOUNDS OF A SHOWER
IN THE BACKGROUND AMY IN VIRGILS ROBE PULLS A
JUICE CONTAINER OUT OF THE FRIDGE - POURS HERSELF A
GLASS PUTTING THE JUICE ON THE COUNTER AS SHE WALKS
INTO THE LIVING ROOM - TAKING IN THE SPARSENESS OF
HIS SURROUNDINGS
CLOSE ON - an open Braille Book The
completely white pages with minute bumps Amy
pulls up a chair sits - and flips through the
book running her hand across the pages -
trying to understand his world
She then turns to the front cover to see what
it is Playboy
We hear the shower stop as Amy smiles puts
the book down - pushes the chair aside then
moves to a series of pictures on the wall
Virgil as a young boy - his sister Jennie a
few years older - and his mother and father
Then another picture next to it - Virgil in
his skates and Jennie older - no father -
Sophie at their feet
And a final picture - Virgil as an adult - he
and Jennie on the front porch - his arms
wrapped around his sister like hes never
going to let go
VOICE (0OS)
Hello
Amy turns to see - Jennie carrying a bag
under her arm
AMY
Hello
Jennie moves towards the kitchen
JENNIE
Im Jennie Virgils
sister And you are
Virgil steps out - bathrobe - drying his hair
VIRGIL
Jen this is Amy Tremont
Jennie now at the kitchen - stares at the
juice container - places it back in the fridge
- just so
JENNIE
I was just at the market
Virgil picking up a few
things before school - and
I thought you might like
some
VIRGIL
(smells)
Apples and bananas Amy
sees the fruit on the
counter - impressed
JENNIE
Hes being a show-off Amy
- I always bring him these
(putting them in
the fridge)
The apples are on the
bottom shelf
VIRGIL
At two oclock Oranges at
10 I know thanks
JENNIE
Amy -- you in town long
And WHAM - Virgil moving into the room
collides right into the chair Amy moved -
knocking into a lamp sending it to the ground
Jennie immediately rushes over
AMY
Virgil
VIRGIL
Im fine
JENNIE
No youre not - youre
bleeding
(turning to Amy
sudden)
First lesson with a blind
man Amy - dont change
anything - its too
dangerous
AMY
(moving to Virgil)
Im sorry - I didnt
know
VIRGIL
It was my fault Im OK
Jennie still dabbing at his leg
VIRGIL
(embarassed snaps)
Goddamit Jennie - I said I
was OK - leave me alone
Jennie hesitates then stands to go - sees the
hockey book out of place A glance to Amy and
she picks it up - quietly moves it back to
its rightful spot
JENNIE
Ive got parent meetings
tonight - theres dinner in
the freezer - left corner
(turns to Amy)
Nice to have met you Amy
AMY
Me too - and again - Im
sorry
And shes gone - leaving Amy and Virgil
together - a moment of awkwardness
AMY
She seemed nice
VIRGIL
She seemed jealous
AMY
Your leg is still bleeding
VIRGIL
Itll stop - happens all
the time Welcome to my
world We hold on Amy -
taking this in
INT BEAR MIN - LATER THAT NIGHT
Japanese lanterns criss-cross across an open
area Guests of the spa mingle about - drinks
in hand - some dance on a floor set up over
the aerobics area Music plays in the
background
Amy carrying two trays of food finds her way
to where Virgil sits at a table off to the
side - putting his food in front of him
AMY
Lets see if I can get this
right Chickens at three -
salad at seven - vegetables
at ten
VIRGIL
(picking up his
fork)
Very good - thank-you
AMY
This is nice They do this
every weekend
VIRGIL
Every Friday - for the
guests leaving Supposed to
make them want to come
back
AMY
(sits uneasy)
Love the music - Gershwin -

makes you want to
She stops Virgil fork poised over his food
senses her uncomfortableness

VIRGIL
You like dancing

AMY
Hmmm Yeah - dont do it

much
(changing subject)
Chickens good
Amy resumes eating - Virgils fork spears
something on his plate - raising it to his
mouth - both we and Amy now see its a large
pat of butter Too late - its in his mouth
Amy watches him - the reaction on his face as
he tastes it - then surreptitiously swallows
it Then realizes Amy saw him
VIRGIL
Nothing like a good pat of
fat What do you say we
dance
AMY
No really Im fine
Virgil is up - pulling her hand
VIRGIL
Come on
She stands and Virgil puts his hands on the
back of her shoulders
VIRGIL
Lead on
And as she ushers him to the floor the music
changes - a salsa - lively Amy stops

AMY
Different piece - maybe we
should

VIRGIL

You kidding - take my hand
And as she does - Virgil starts dancing to the
music - feeling the beat - in perfect rhythm
but his moves are his own something weve
never seen before - uninhibited wild - a
little funny but also theres something
sensual in his abandonment
All Amy can do is hang on for the ride -
enjoying Virgil enjoying himself People even
clear back a little to give him some room -
however he moves about the floor easily -
somehow sensing where the other couples are
Its a whirlwind moment - a moment where the
two of them get lost with each other - for a
second shutting out the world and its just
them the music and their movement
Then suddenly the music is over And they stop
- the moment gone Virgil turns to Amy and she
applauds Virgils wild moves

He takes a bow with a flourish Spins to
another angle - another bow Spins back again
- a step back and
CRASSSH - hes into the buffet table - sliding
to the ground - food spilling on top of him
Amy cant help but laugh rushes to him
AMY

You have to teach me that

move
And Amy reaches down to his guacamole covered
hand - and pulls him up into an embrace and as
they kiss amidst sauce and salad dressing - we
see
INT AMYS HOTEL ROOM - MORNING
Amy - on the phone - looking out her window

AMY

Betsy - you were telling me

about your father his

cataracts - you said he had

a problem How is he now

(she listens)

Doctor - Dr Aaron - do

you have his number
INT BEAR MIN GYM - DAY
A handful of people on various pieces of
equipment Virgil tank top heavy sweat on a
stationary bicycle - working out Amy next to
him on a treadmill - trying to keep up as
Caroline from the front desk comes and hands
her something
Amy reads it briefly then hops off the
treadmill moving to Virgil

AMY
Virgil I just got some
great news

VIRGIL
(picking up speed
again)
The Atlanta project
AMY
No no - I was talking to
my assistant this morning -
her father had these severe

cataracts
VIRGIL
(slowing)
Oh Really
AMY

She put me in touch with a
Dr Richard Aaron - the
guys the leading eye
surgeon on the eastern
seaboard - hes been
working with techniques - I
dont know all the jargon -
but I spoke to him earlier
on the phone at the
Institute
VIRGIL
You called this guy
Virgil stops riding - starts to get off the
bike
AMY
(excited)
I told him all about you -
he just faxed me back -
hed love to get a look at
your eyes - he thinks
maybe mavbe - there might
be a chance of reversal
Virgil faces Amy best he can while he pulls
on his sweat jacket
VIRGIL
I dont get it - am I
missing the sign that says
its help the handicapped
week
Virgil starts to move away Amy stops him
AMY
I thought youd be excited
Whats the problem
Virgil turns on her
VIRGIL
No problem Thats the
whole point here Amy -
there is no goddamned
problem
And Virgil turns and bumps into a stationary
bike he SHOVES it off to the side and makes
his way out of the gym
INT LOCKER ROOM - DAY
Virgil enters visibly upset - passing a CO-
WORKER coming out of the shower
CO-WORKER
Hey Virgil
Virgil steams right past him - not answering -
hands feeling down the lockers - finding his -
he tugs it open - pulls off his shirt and
throws it in He takes a breath settles
himself - then SLAMS the locker door shut
EXT JENNIES SCHOOL
PARENTS are picking up their CHILDREN from
Jennies school As Jennie helps the last of
the kids into her mothers car - she looks up
to see Amy across the street
JENNIE
Amy right
Amy nods - starts towards her

AMY
Id like to talk to you if
I could -- about Virgil
JENNIE

Something wrong
AMY
Sort of Theres something
I dont understand You see
I spoke to a doctor whos
apparently doing
breakthrough work on
cataracts —-
(Jennie turns to
Amy)
- but when I brought it up
to Virgil he acted as if
JENNIE
What dont you understand
AMY
If I was blind almost all
my life -- and there was
even a remote possibility I
could see - Id jump at it
JENNIE
When theres something
youve adapted to accepted
- youd just want to change
it without even thinking
about it
(beat)
Were very comfortable
here Amy Virgil has
everything he needs
AMY
I thought just maybe hed
like to not be falling over
things for the rest of his
life Look I see
JENNIE
(cuts her off)
Yes you do and Virgil
doesnt He spent the first
eight years of his life
having his eyes prodded
pierced and poked by
doctors faith healers
spiritualists shamans and
medicine men My father had
them lined up out the door
It hurt and disappointed us
all and it almost killed
him He doesnt need to go
through that again Now -
maybe you understand
And she turns on her heel and is gone
EXT VIRGILS COTTAGE - LATE DAY
Amy making her way up to the porch - hearing
from inside
VIRGIL (VO)
No no - why - why
She hurries up the steps reaching the open
door where she sees Virgil his head in his
hands
VIRGIL (VO)
I cant believe youre
doing this to me
AMY
What - Virgil
Virgil turns sharply - Sophie jumps up -
starts barking
VIRGIL
Sophie - stop it Amy
Cmon in - its just the
Rangers I could check
better than these guys
today
AMY
They lost
VIRGIL
I prefer to think of it as
not winning I thought you
would have been long gone
after that outburst from my
evil twin brother Weve
had him committed you know
Rikers Island - hard time
(standing)
Can I get you something - -
Coke - beer
AMY
No - I - Im fine I just
wanted apologize for
stomping around in life
like Bigfoot today
Virgil turns towards Amy
VIRGIL
Amy you see the big tree
outside How far is it from
my front porch

AMY
Guessing about thirty
feet

VIRGIL

To you But to me its
fourteen steps exactly
Fourteen steps and I arrive
right where I want to be

But -- if I run or rush
Ill lose count and slam
into it

AMY

Im sorry Told you - cant
leave well enough alone I
- I guess I should get
back start to pack
VIRGIL
Rushing into trees again
Off Amys smile we CUT TO
EXT VIRGILS HOUSE - NIGHT
On the Porch - the two of them - sipping
glasses of wine - we see their dinner - Hungry
Man beef entree - each category of food in
its own perfect little compartment
AMY
You know this dinner - this
is really quite
VIRGIL
Ordinary
(she laughs)
Its an acquired taste -
trust me Jennie thinks
its the only way Ill know
where my food is But I
have a secret weapon
(holds up a little
bottle)
Hot sauce Lets you know
youre eating something -
like some
He starts to sprinkle liberally on Amys food
Amy laughing grabs the bottle
AMY
Thats OK - Ill do it
Dont want to overdo it
She puts the bottle down - looks to Virgil -
sips her wine Time to face it

AMY
Virgil - I have to go home
tomorrow

VIRGIL
Wait wait - you smell
that

AMY
No - what

VIRGIL

The winter pines - its so
strong at night - drifts on
the wind - wait - hear the
breeze then

AMY

There
Amy closes her eyes - takes in the scent - and
they both sit there - close - taking in the
night air - enjoying the moment
And on Virgils face we see him lost in
thought
INT VIRGILS HOME - NIGHT
CLOSE ON VIRGIL - eyes closed - we hear a
sound - like night crickets His eyes slowly
open

He rolls over - his arm reaching out for her
But theres no one there Virgil sits upright
VIRGIL

Amy
Amy is sitting in a chair by the window

AMY
Im here - trouble
sleeping

VIRGIL
Cmere

And she crawls back into bed Virgil takes
hold of her and as she settles into his arm
he strokes her face gently - a blind mans
version of watching his lover fall to sleep
BLACK - then we hear voices
INT VIRGILS BEDROOM - MORNING
CLOSE ON Amys face - the voices awaken her -
cutting into her dreams
She looks out the doorway - sees Virgil and
Jenny arguing on the front porch She cant
hear what they are saying - but its clear
theres a problem
INT VIRGILS LIVING ROOM - MORNING
Amy pulling a robe around herself - comes into
the room - as Jenny turns on her heel and
walks away from Virgil
EXT PORCH - MORNING
Virgil stands there a moment - taking in what
just happened Amy steps out onto the porch
AMY
Everything alright
VIRGIL
Yeah yeah Morning - Look
something I want to say
AMY
The leaving thing - I know
- hate it too
VIRGIL
The other night - when we
were dancing - being with
you - I felt different -
special - I dont know -
whole
AMY
That was whole
Virgil puts his hand out - she takes it - he
turns to her

VIRGIL
(smile)
Just for a second I felt
like I could see you - all
of you
(beat)
What you said about this
Doctor this eye guy - I
know how important it is to
you
AMY
(turns to him)
Are you sure you want to do
this
VIRGIL
Were just going to talk to
the guy - what could it
hurt Off Amys smile

EXT GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE - MORNING
A soaring shot Amys car - travelling across
the bridge - heading towards Manhattan
AMY (V0)
Youre going to love the
city - so many things to
see
INT CAR - MORNING
Virgil in the passenger seat - windows open -
taking in all the sounds - new and exciting
Amy watches him as she drives
VIRGIL
(laughing)
Waitwaitwait - he hasnt
said he can even do
anything yet
AMY
I know I just feel good
about this
(Amy looks to him -
sees him feeling
the light against
his face)
Virgil before you lost all
sight do you remember
seeing anything at all
VIRGIL
Yeah I do I was just a
baby when it happened - but
there is one thing
(beat)
Something puffy Thats
all I remember about it
Everyone says its
clouds but I know I had
it in my hands - so it
couldnt be clouds This
puffy thing - that was
something special - its
stayed with me all these
years - I dont know why
INT NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - EXAM ROOM - DAY
DR RICHARD AARON wire rims short stylish
haircut - is finishing a high-tech examination
of Virgils eyes Cups attached to wires sit
over his eyes The machine an
ELECTRORETINOGRAM emits an irritating strange
flat line sound The room is very dimly lit
Aaron adjusts an intensity dial on the machine
- a series of flashing lights hit Virgils
eyes The doctor jots down a reading - then

SMASH
TO
with a flourish spins the machine away from
Virgils face and pops a button emitting a
detailed computer print out
In the corner sits an older gentleman - Dr
Goldman - focused on papers in his hands
AARON
OK - were done
Aaron bumps up the lights and wheels his chair
back over to Virgil as Amy moves to join them
AARON
Some good news You have
grade 4 posterior
subscapular cataracts
VIRGIL
And this is the good news
AARON
Good news in that I should
be able to remove them with
little or no damage to your
cornea
AMY
So -- what does that mean -
theyre gone - then what
AARON
The cataracts are acting
like a curtain - covering
the window of sight If the
disease to the retina is
reduced as much as I think
it is - theres a very good
possibility we can give you
sight
Amy looks to Virgil - apprehensive Virgils
expressionless - taking this all in
VIRGIL
Sounds expensive
AARON
(looks to Goldman
who nods
imperceptibly)
We feel theres an
opportunity for us all here
- I think I can get the
institute to pick up the
bill
VIRGIL
So Say you remove the
cataracts - do you have any
idea what kind of vision
Id have
Aaron looks to Goldman
AARON
At this time - no
Unfortunately the cataracts
are not allowing me to see
the retinal wall I cant
tell how advanced the
retinitas pigmentosa has
become
VIRGIL
So youre suggesting an
operation that may or may
not be successful
AMY
But there is a chance he
could regain his sight
AARON
ere have been a few cases
f restored vision in
dulthood to a patient
lind since birth
(moves near Virgil)
e operation is delicate
ll admit - but nothing as
nvasive as what you went
rough as a child Of
ourse there is always some
isks with any operation -
nfection swelling - long
shot stuff I would do both
eyes at the same time -
its basically out patient
surgery Virgil - an exhale
of air A lot to take in
VIRGIL
What if it doesnt work
What if I have the
operation - with all its
risks - and you remove the
cataract - and it doesnt
work
Aaron looks to Amy

om oH

BROdhHA

AARON
(somber)

It would be evident that

you will never be able to

see
Virgils head shifts slightly Not what he
wanted to hear Amy reaches out takes his
hand

AMY
What do you think
VIRGIL
Thats what I need - to

think
EXT AMYS LOFT - SOHO - DAY
Virgil and Amy stepping out of a cab Virgil

using his cane - seems blinder than weve seen
him before The city sounds an assault on him
AMY

This is my place - theres
a park across the street
and
She stops - realizes he wants to walk in
silence They enter her loft building an old
converted industrial space
INT LOFT STAIRWELL - DAY
There is an odd loud sound which echoes three
times after every bounce As they come up on
the second floor landing a basketball comes
flying down the hall which Amy fumbles with -
then catches
AMY
Ethan
From around the corner comes ETHAN COLVIN
eight oversized Knicks shirt Amy tosses him
his ball
ETHAN
Sorry - my mom wont let me

AMY
Well if the super catches

VIRGIL
Hey Ethan
ETHAN

And he turns and runs back up the stairs
AMY
(apologetic)
Virgil
VIRGIL
Hey the kid thinks Im
cool - whats so bad
INT AMYS LOFT - LATE DAY
Amys loft is a wide open space - a KITCHEN
facing onto a small living area - a BED in the
corner of the room - a WORK SPACE with
DRAFTING BOARD and DRAWING RACKS fill one side
of the room By a window stands a plaster
SCULPTURE stuck in the corner as if forgotten
AMY
This is where I hang my hat
- its a bit of a mess
but
Amy stops realizes he cant see it Virgil
puts his overnight bag down
VIRGIL
Now Blind 101 Help me out
with a mental map Walk me
down a straight line and
show me your place all the
obstacles Remember once
youve told me they cant
be moved - otherwise
AMY
Got it - here take my arm
(they start about
the room)
Couch chair TV to the
left low table at at 4
oclock has the phone on
it
They come to the Sculpture Virgils hand
grazes across it

VIRGIL
Whats this

AMY
Nothing A sculpture

VIRGIL
Its yours

AMY

My art school days - not
very good
Virgil continues to feel the sculpture from
top to bottom not stopping during the
dialogue
VIRGIL
Its a mother - holding
her child - up in the air -
like shes proud Its
beautiful
AMY
Its not done yet - one day
Ill finish it
Virgil turns - his hand to the wall - feels a
window
VIRGIL
Does this window open I
could use some air
AMY
(moving to the
windows)
I think so
As Amy throws open the window a wind blasts
through - catching a stack of plans on her
drafting table - blowing them across the
floor

AMY
Damn
Virgil turns concerned makes his way to her
VIRGIL

What happened
AMY
The wind - knocked over my
plans
Amy down on the floor picking them up - Virgil
senses her down there - crouches down beside
her - tries to help her pick up
VIRGIL
What is this - these plans
Amy looks at Virgil - - his hand running
across one of her plans
AMY
Just my work - - some plans
for the Atlanta project
were bidding on - drawings
of a lobby were finishing
up some other smaller
stuff Its -- its what I
do
Amy realizes they mean nothing to him - he
hands them back - stands She watches him -
then standing moves to him
AMY
Ive got to get to work
Tonight well do something
- we could listen to music
or go out for dinner

VIRGIL
How about a movie

AMY
A movie

VIRGIL
Yeah I havent been in
years

AMY
Alright A movie I wont
be long

And Amy gives him a quick kiss and dodges for
the door - a beat - she forgets her purse -
steps back in to see
Virgil standing there quietly - his hand out
on her plans again - feeling the paper -
searching for the design - wanting to know her
- wanting to understand her - finding nothing
there
Amy feels uncomfortable - quietly steps out -
closes the door
INT REVIVAL THEATER - NIGHT
WIDE - the theater half full playing Woody
Allens Annie Hall the very funny scene
where Woody and Diane Keaton wrestle with the
lobster
We move in slowly and discover Virgil and Amy
leaning in close to each other - Amy quietly
describing the scene to him
AMY

Theres these big pots and

Woodys got a huge lobster

in his hand
VIRGIL
Lobster - whats a lobster
AMY
(trying not to use
her hands to
describe)
Its a kind of like
its got
Then she looks to Virgil - sees he was kidding
her

AMY
(laughing)
Thats it - youre on your

own

Off Virgils laugh

INT SUBWAY LINE - NIGHT

BWAM - a subway train explodes past us

INT SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

A collection of typical night riders -
everyone keeping to themselves Two kids sit
in the corner - blasting their boom box Virgil
stands in the middle of the train - enjoying
the vibrations Amy sits on a seat watching
him

VIRGIL
And they lived happily ever
after
AMY
Woody and Diane
VIRGIL
And the lobster
AMY

Stop with the lobster
A song comes on the radio - Virgils head
turns
VIRGIL
Hey - you here that
All she hears is the clatter of the subway
AMY
What
Virgil turns towards the music - BAPPING his
hands rhythmically on the subway car wall
VIRGIL
Hey - can you turn that up
The KID shrugs - CRAKKS it up Its Gershwins
Cant take that Away from Me Virgil turns
to Amy - picks up on the song - hands RAPPING
- he starts singing
VIRGIL
The way you comb your
hair The way you sip your
tea
He finds Amy pulls her up and into an embrace
as he saunters them down the aisle
AMY
Virgil
VIRGIL
(loudly)
Cant take that away from
meee - what
AMY
People are watching
VIRGIL
Watching Watching what
AMY
You Me Everyone is
staring at us

VIRGIL
And

AMY
Well - it can be
embarrassing

VIRGIL

(kidding)

Oh - I see

AMY

No - you dont
VIRGIL Touche The way you make me see
AMY
(turns to him)
What do you mean
(Virgil gives her a
look -
I want the
operation)
You mean it I mean I only
want you to have the
operation
VIRGIL
Amy I want the chance to
see The chance to see
Central Park the Brooklyn
Bridge apples raisins a
buffalo a carbuerator and
the man in the moon
(beat)
But I would give all that
up - just to see this face
And Amy folds herself into Virgil - a moment -
they hold each other - then - Amy starts to
sing along with the song - Virgil joining in -
and they dance - together - in love

EXT SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT
AMYVIRGIL (V0)

You cant take that away

from me
And the car explodes past again - and as the
music dies we cut to
INT NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - OPERATING ROOM
CLOSE ON a platter of silver utensils - fine
exacting scalpels A gloved HAND comes into

SMASH
CUT TO
frame - picks up a clamp - and we follow it
to
VIRGILS EYES - the clamp being used to hold
it open The work we are seeing is grueling -
difficult to watch - but at the same time so
fascinating it is hard to take our eyes off
Dr Aaron followed by Dr Goldman - hands in
the air - mask on - leans over Virgil - looks
to the ANESTHESIOLOGIST who nods - then to no
one in particular
AARON
OK Virgil - lets get to
it
And as he is handed a SCALPEL we watch as it
moves down to cut open the white section of
the eye - and just as it feels almost
unbearable to watch- -
INT NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - DAY
We see Amy coffee cup in hand grab a second
just poured cup out of a vending machine She
makes her way over to reveal Jennie who sits
quietly reading a book
AMY
Coffee Its really bad
Jennie looks up - smiles takes the cup Amy
sits down next to her They both sip for a
moment
AMY
Virgil never mentions his
parents - do they know
JENNIE
Our mother died when I was
20 - Virgil wasnt even a
teenager And our father -
hes been gone for quite
awhile
AMY
Im sorry I didnt know
Jennie looks into her coffee - takes another
sip

JENNIE
(smile)
Youre right this is bad
AMY

It must have been very
tough on you - taking care
of Virgil alone after your
mother died

JENNIE
Hes my brother

Simple

AMY
You dont like Virgil doing
this - do you

JENNIE
I dont like Virgil getting
hurt Hope is like fire it
can keep you warm - - or it
can burn you
INT NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - OPERATING ROOM - DAY
Dr Aaron - focused on his exacting work His
hands move deftly
CLOSE ON Virgils eye Cut open Aarons
probe working right in the middle of it
DR AARON
There you are
And Aaron pulls out the cloudy cataract tissue
- holding it up for all to see - before he
PLOPS it on a tray Switching instruments - he
gingerly picks up a plastic implant - moving
back towards the eye - he glances at the nurse
assisting him
DR AARON
You know what they say
Virgil The eyes are the
windows to the soul
Virgil cant move - listens intently as he
carefully places the implant into Virgils
eye
DR AARON
(with a wink)
That makes us the Windex to
the soul
(he focuses)
OK both eyes done Lets
patch him up
On a large monitor we see an EXTREME CLOSE-UP
of Virgils eye - waiting
INT NEW YORK HOSPITAL - LATER
Virgil being wheeled down a hall - head
wrapped in bandages
INT EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY
As he enters

VIRGIL
Hello
Jennies there - takes his hand
VIRGIL
Jennie
JENNIE
Howre you feeling
VIRGIL

OK - a little pain like a
tequila hang over - is Amy
here
AMY
Right here - Dr Aaron said
you did great
VIRGIL
So hows my hair - Id hate
the first time I see myself
to be a bad hair day
(Virgil reacts to a
sound)
Whats that
AMY
Theres camera guys here
too
WIDE - we now see the room has a small VIDEO
CREW in it preparing to document the event

VIRGIL
Camera guys
AARON
(entering)

For posterity Were going
to make you famous Were
also sending this closed
circuit to one of our
conference rooms - theres
a lot of people interested
in our results today So
how you feel Virgil

VIRGIL
Good Great Fine
(a laugh)

Nervous
Aaron moves about the room closing blinds to
let in just a few slats of light
AARON
Nothing to be nervous
about Now Jennie and Amy
if you would stand off to
my right -- I want Virgil
to get just a slight bounce
of light
(returning to
Virgil)
Ready Virgil
VIRGIL
Lets go
Both Amy and Jennie subconsciously adjust
their hair as Aaron starts to unravel the
bandages
When the bandages are completely off - all
that is left are two gauze patches on both
eyes
AARON
Okay - last phase - we
remove these patches and
VIRGIL
(suddenly
apprehensive hand
up)
Okay - wait So - so - what
do I do I mean what will
I see first
AARON
Well - were all here -
Amy your sister This is
new for us all Why dont
we find out
Aaron reaches up and plucks the two patches
from his eyes - and everyone waits
Virgil slowly opens his eyes - he just seems
to be staring blankly bewildered - not
focusing at Aaron who stands before him still
holding the bandages
Amy looks to Jennie - to Aaron - whats
happening Then finally
AARON
Well
And Virgil reacts - a startling look of
recognition mixed with fear crossing his face
AMY
What is it Virgil
VIRGIL
Its - its - I dont know
And now for the first time we see Virgils
POV
There is light movement color shadow - but
somehow it is foreign to us There is no
perception of depth - no sense of definition
of shape or shadow - it is as confounding to
us as it is to Virgil - like an explosion of
Picasso Dali and Monet on screen
Suddenly in the midst of this chaos of images
- there is movement - and a voice emits out of
what we now for the first time recognize as a
mouth Dr Aaron speaks again - leaning in to
Virgil who reacts back
AARON
Virgil - what do you see
VIRGIL
Somethings wrong
Jennies reaction comes pouring out of her
eyes in tears first slowly then a dam break

AMY
Virgil whats wrong Whats
happening

AARON

Everythings fine - its
going to take
JENNIE
Its not fine - dont say
its fine
AARON
Tell me what youre seeing
Virgil
Virgil suddenly pulling back - his eyes
dancing around in his head - trying to take it
all in - trying to focus
VIRGIL
(over everyone)
I dont know - its all
screwed up - this cant be
seeing - somethings wrong
- too confusing - what the
hells happening
HIS POV - the camera crew coming toward him
for a closer shot - its like a giant monster
violently moving towards us
VIRGIL
What is it - Stop
Virgils hand lashes out towards the camera
crew - even though they are 15 feet away
AARON
What The camera
JENNIE
(to the crew)
Stop moving
AMY
Virgil its just the
camera
The room has heightened into chaos - Virgil
reacting to everything he sees any quick
movement - Amy moves next to him - Aaron
trying to remain calm - Jennie assuring Virgil
everythings OK
AARON
Alright - alright - theyve
stopped OK Lets
everybody just calm down -
well take it slowly
Everyone settles - takes a breath
AMY
Virgil What can we do
They all look to Virgil - breathing heavy -
his eyes swinging back and forth
VIRGIL
I gotta focus - gotta think
- gimme a second - OK OK -
get me a coke Somebody
JENNIE
Hes thirsty - someone get
him a drink
VIRGIL
No - just a can - a bottle
-- put something in my
hands
Amy reaches over - grabs an empty coke can
AMY
Here - hows this
Virgil takes it in his hands - closes his eyes
- feels it Then slowly opens his eyes -
trying to focus on what is in his hand - Aaron
catching on
AARON
Good Virgil - thats it -
use your touch - associate
- now tell me - what do
you see in your hand
Long moment Virgil holds it up - stares hard
VIRGIL
A can Is it a can
JENNIE
Whats going on
They all look at Virgil turning the can over
and over in his hand - staring intently at it
- learning it

AARON
(beams)

Hes associating - one

sense to the other His

fingers tell his brain -

then his brain tells his

eyes and he recognizes the

image in front of him

(realizing)

Hes seeing
Aaron looks to Amy and Jennie - theyre still
doubtful - he motions to them to meet him
outside

AARON

Virgil - lets rest your

eyes for today and well

check them again tomorrow

We should all be happy -

weve got something
Virgil not happy just very confused As
Aaron leaves Jennie takes Virgils hand while
Amy stands there upset - watching him just
staring at a Soda Can
INT NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - DAY
In the corridor Dr Aaron shaking hands with
Dr Goldman - people exiting the near-by
conference room all congratulating the two
doctors As Amy exits the room - Aaron moves
to her

AMY
What just happened in
there

AARON
You saw it Success

AMY
Success - wait a minute -

then why cant he see me
his sister anything

AARON
He sees you He just
doesnt understand that he
sees you

AMY
But hell overcome it - I
mean - this is temporary
right

AARON
Theres a very real
possibility the part of his
brain area allocated to
vision is atrophied - given
its lack of use Virgil
has probably used it for
some other function
Jennie has stepped into the waiting area - has
just heard Aaron
JENNIE
You didnt think of this
This is as much an accusation of Amy as of
Aaron
AARON
We had no way of knowing
what his faculties were
until we gave him the
operation If you remember
- we didnt know what to
expect - though its clear
his retinal disease must be
in remission
AMY
So what are we supposed to
do now - you saw him - its
like hes another person in
there
AARON
He wont need to stay here
- take him home - let him
rest But I will need to
see him every couple of
days for the next month
AMY
Isnt there some kind of
therapy he should be doing
- someone to help him
Aaron stares at her - hadnt thought of this
AARON
K there is a visual
erapist - Ray Webster - a
ittle unorthodox - thats
y hes probably your best
et especially considering
e unique aspects of
irgils condition Ill
ontact him for you - but
eres no guarantee he can

yvrradtatoerato

be
ie

JENNIE
(cant believe
this)
No guarantees
AARON
Jennie I told Amy here
when we first talked - this
is whole new ground - for
all of us
And Jennie quietly turns and goes back into
Virgils room Amy just stares at Dr Aaron -
a little overwhelmed
INT HOSPITAL ROOM - CHANGE AREA - DAY
Virgil - starting to dress He stares at his
clothes on a hangar - not comprehending what
it is He closes his eyes - his hand going out
to feel it - then opening his eyes - he takes
the shirt turns - and notices someone watching
him
VIRGIL
Hello
HIS POV - its his own reflection in a mirror
next to his clothes Virgil stares at himself
standing stock still - waiting for a response
from the person staring at him
VIRGIL
Is there
Slowly realizing that what he sees is himself
He starts moving towards the mirror
fascinated
Virgils POV - Focusing on the image as it
slowly takes shape - becomes clearer to him
His hand going up to his nose - moving it back
and forth - laughs at its absurdity - then is
taken with his own smile He tries a smile -
comes off awkward as he starts to stare at his
teeth Touching each part of his face he
investigates his chin ears and finally his
hair
Then he stops - and just stares - and stares
at a face that is his own - but so incredibly
foreign to him Who is this person
INT VIRGILS ROOM - DAY
Jenny starting to pack up Virgils things
Suddenly there is a burst of laughter from the
other room She looks up quizzically
INT HOSPITAL CHECK-OUT - DAY
Amy in the check-in area - pacing - ona

Jenny - finishing packing up Virgils things
VIRGIL (VO)

Jenny looks up - Virgil standing in the
doorway dressed
JENNIE
No - its Jennie
She moves toward him - Virgil pulls back -
hands out in front of him
JENNIE
Im sorry - Ill move
slower - I just
And Virgils hands are on her face - eyes
closed - feeling He opens his eyes - staring
blankly - trying to figure this out
VIRGIL
This is you
JENNIE
This is me
INT HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY
Angle on Amy moving down the hall - hearing
the voices
INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
JENNIE
Everythings going to be
alright - we just need to

VIRGIL
No no - I cant go home I
need to be here - see the
therapist - doctors I
want to be here
JENNIE
But I cant stay here - and
you cant do this alone--
whos going to take care

She stops Realizing
ANGLE On Amy - outside the door - not wanting
to go in
JENNIE
Amy Shes going to look
after you She doesnt know
anything about the blind
VIRGIL
Im not blind anymore - and
Im not going to let
someone I care about walk
out of my life again
JENNIE
(moves to him)
Its not your fault he
left You cant keep
blaming yourself
VIRGIL
(beat)
Im staying here
A pause - and Jennie moves her hand out to him
- touches his arm
INT HALLWAY - DAY
Amy feeling uncomfortable - starts to step
away
JENNIE (0S)
Amy
Amy turns - Jennie in the doorway
JENNIE
Virgils finishing getting
ready Could you walk me to
my car
Amy nods - sees an element of defeat in
Jennies eyes
EXT HOSPITAL - LATE DAY
Jennie and Amy stand on the curb near Jennies
car A moment of uncomfortableness - then
AMY
You alright
JENNIE
Im scared to death Ive
spent my whole life looking
for any holes he might fall
in Id run up ahead and
cover them Everywhere I
look here I see holes
AMY
Please believe me - I dont
want him to get hurt
anymore than you do
JENNIE
Amy - when Virgil was very
young he couldnt see
those close to him - so he
never learned to reach out
(turns to her)
Dont expect him to reach
out when hes in pain or
confused or unhappy If
you really care about him
you have to just be there
for him
And before Amy can answer she gets into her
car - starts it up and drives off
EXTINT AMYSLOFT - DUSK
Virgil slowly gets out of the cab looks up at
the buildings - immediately gets dizzy and
nearly falls over Amy lunges to help him
Virgil is laughing in spite of himself
VIRGIL
This is just great - I
dont believe this Whats
that saying - stop the
world I wanna get off
ETHAN (0OS)
Hey Virgil its Ethan
Virgil turns to the familiar voice Ethan
basketball under his arm coming out of the
building with his Mom KAREN COLVIN Virgil
scans tries to focus on them

VIRGIL
That you Ethan

ETHAN
Its me - and this is my

mom
AMY
Virgil - Karen
KAREN
Hi Virgil - heard a lot
about you
ETHAN
You look funny
VIRGIL
You should see how I look
from this side
AMY Lets just get you inside - then you can
rest Well see you later Ethan Karen
And she gives Karen a small glance as she
takes Virgils arm as they start towards the
stairs leading into the building - Virgil
suddenly slamming to a halt
VIRGIL
Wait wait what are we
doing - WERE WALKING INTO
A WALL
Virgils POV - the staircase A flat image - a
solid wall with horizontal lines Ethan
surprised whats up here
AMY
Its OK - its not a wall -
its just a staircase
Youre going to have to
trust me on these things
VIRGIL
God I feel like like
such a child - I just
thought seeing would be
different
AMY
Well get a hold of this
Ray Webster guy - well get
his help
Virgil steps slowly forward - giant baby steps
- each foot reaching out to feel the step
before making the commitment
HIS POV - the wall of stairs changing
perspective with each step Like an accordion
spreading itself out to us This is all a very
bad acid trip
INT AMYS APARTMENT - DUSK
VIRGILS POV - multi-colored balloons dozens
of assorted flowers bowls of colorful fruit
and streamers intertwined across the room A
candyland of seeing
VIRGIL
Man Something exploded in
your apartment
Amy laughs - pulls him into the room Virgil
trying to take it all in - not understanding
anything
AMY
I wanted to do something
special for you
VIRGIL
Its making me a little bit
dizzy - but it is special
Virgils hands go out - Amy moves to him - he
holds her shoulders He stares at her
As she turns her head slightly Virgil is able
to focus on her - her eyes - her smile
VIRGIL
Okay - so - this is what
beautiful looks like
AMY
Thank-you You want to see
the rest Focusing on her
Virgil smiles takes her
face in his hands - leans
in and kisses her She
pulls back a little
AMY
I cant believe this - how
nervous I am
She kisses him then takes a step back

AMY
What if you dont like what
you see

VIRGIL

Do you want me to turn off
the lights
AMY
No - no This is your first
seeing day
(she starts to
unbutton her dress)
I want you to see
everything
And she drops the dress from her shoulders -
it hits the ground - a beat - and she stands
there naked
AMY
OK
VIRGIL
Yes very OK
And she takes a step towards him and folds
into his arms and as they kiss we slowly fade
to black
INT AMYS LOFT - NIGHT
The sound of heavy New York rain Amy
awakening and sees Virgil is gone his side
of the bed empty She looks across the room -
where she sees silhouetted against the moonlit
window - - Virgil standing next to Amys
sculpture his face and body pressed up
against the pane of glass
AMY
(wrapping a house
coat around her)
Virgil
Virgil turns around - half faces her - the
rain on the windows decorating his face
VIRGIL
I cant sleep - Im afraid
if I close my eyes
AMY
Itll be black when you
open them again
Virgil nods A moment and his hand goes out to
her sculpture
VIRGIL
You enjoy sculpting
AMY
At first I liked the idea
of molding - taking the way
I saw things up here- -
(touching her head)
- and making it take shape
with my hands
VIRGIL
But you never finish them
AMY
Pieces never come out the
way I wanted - the way I
saw them I end up working
on them forever - like this
one - never getting them

right
Virgil stares out the window at the rain

VIRGIL

This is what rain looks

like
AMY

Yeah
VIRGIL

It looks lonely Not what I

expected But I like it
Amy smiles - moves into him as he pulls her in
close and they look out at the night rain
INT ROSWELL-TREMONT - DAY
Amy working over a CAD computer with and
draftsman

AMY
Youve got to alter each of
the windows by five feet

DRAFTSMAN
These are the specs you

Betsy

Betsy pokes her head in
AMY

Can you get me some
research on those Maple
trees were leaving in
Theyre too big - I want to
change them so they fit in
with the design better Get
rid of the dead weight
BETSY

Amy looks to her watch Starts for her jacket
and the door
AMY
Yes yes Thank-you Evan

DUNCAN (0OS)

Duncan steps out of his office She turns -
virtually out the door
AMY
Just give me two hours
And shes gone
EXT NYU CAMPUS - NEXT DAY
A few KIDS smoking on the steps Others
entering laden down with books - a small sea
parting to allow Amy helping Virgil up the
steps and inside
INT NYU HALLWAY - DAY
They make their way down the hall - past a -
room where a group of BLIND CHILDREN learn to
read Braille Amy cant help but stare at
these young faces struggling to learn Its a
whole different world
INT RAY WEBSTERS OFFICE - DAY
A strange space dark as all the windows are
covered In a jar on the desk - two pickled
eyeballs stare back at Virgil and Amy waiting
patiently There are books everywhere -
periodicals stacked and overflowing on
shelves A dead plant in the corner
RAY WEBSTER - 60s almost completely bald
wearing a worn NYU sweatshirt sits at the
desk in front of them - flipping through a
file in front of him
WEBSTER
Right - OK Virgil - says
here you went blind at one
- before you developed a
visual vocabulary
(Webster stands -
moves towards a
bookshelf)
You have no sense of depth
of field no knowledge of
space shape size or
distance Basically your
eyes work but your brain
hasnt learned to process
the information
(beat)

You are mentallv blind
Neurologists call this
visual agnosia

VIRGIL
I call it pretty screwed
up

WEBSTER
Better term Ill make a
note of that

Webster plops down a large book - flips
through some pages then searching his

pockets
WEBSTER
Dammit
AMY
What
WEBSTER

Glasses can never find
em

(calling out)
Mrs Fenster

Mrs Fenster pops her head in the door - this
must be a ritual they have as she instantly
pulls her GLASSES off and hands them to
Webster who drops them over his nose They are
clearly womans glasses - pointed in the ends

- little jewels

As Mrs

Fenster leaves

WEBSTER
(referring to the
book)
OK Alberto Valvo Sight
Restoration after Long Term

Blindness - blah-blah-
blah - ah here
(reading)

One must die as a blind
person to be born again as
a sighted person However
it is the interim the
limbo- -between two worlds
one deadthe other
powerless to be born - that
is so terrible
(slamming the book
shut)
There Youre in limbo
AMY
What do you mean - there -
hes in limbo Thats all
you have to offer
WEBSTER
What - Im Anne Bancroft
all of a sudden Ima
professor - I teach people

how to teach the blind how

to become independent

(beat)

Theres no book on what

youre going through - Id

like to help - but like the

rest of things in life -

its up to you

VIRGIL

Wait a minute - up to me I

thought you were going to

help me here
Webster rummages in his desk - pulls out a
magazine photo - then digging in a brown paper
bag - he pulls out an apple

WEBSTER

You want a lesson Right -

here Whats this
He holds out the apple for Virgil - who
reluctantly takes it - holds it in his hand
eyes closed feels it - then opening his eyes
he holds it out in front of him trying to
focus on it
HIS POV - as the apple slowly takes on
dimension and shape

VIRGIL
Its an apple
WEBSTER
Good Good
(holding up the
photo)

OK Whats this now
Virgil stares at the photo HIS POV - a photo
of -- an APPLE Not that different from the
real apple he holds in his hand - he holds the
real apple up to compare - using his eyes
VIRGIL
Its an apple
WEBSTER
(holding the paper
out to Virgil)
Good Good But is it an
apple or just a picture of
an apple
And Virgil feels the paper and suddenly
realizes - its not an apple - just a
representation of one Virgil is visibly
disappointed
VIRGIL
So this is a joke Is that
what youre saying - your
eyes lie to you Great -
looking forward to this
WEBSTER
Your eyesight can and will
play tricks on you Virgil
Remember that No matter
what I could teach you - no
matter what exercises I
could give you - theyll
still play tricks on you
VIRGIL
Thats all it is right now
- one big trick Nothing
makes any sense I cant
function like this
WEBSTER

(he moves to his

chair)
Virgil - look - you have to
learn to see - just like
you learned to speak Only
this is not like learning a
new language - its like
learning language for the
first time

(he leans forward)
Perception - sight - life
is about experience - about
reaching out and exploring
the world for yourself
Its not enough to just see

Virgil --
(he points two
fingers into his
eyes)

-- weve got to look as

well

And Webster turns the fingers from his eyes
outward - to the world
AMY
(wound up)
Well thank-you Obi Wan
Kenobi - but that doesnt
tell us anything What we
need is some assistance
here - some kind of program
- a set of exercises -
were kind of adrift and
WEBSTER
Amy - last I checked - this
isnt a game of Parcheesi
it doesnt come with a set

of rules
AMY
I cant believe youre
just
VIRGIL
Amy Lets go
AMY
No wait Virgil
VIRGIL

Lets go
(standing)
Thank-you Dr Webster
WEBSTER
You want me - Im always
here
And Virgil turns and half steps - half
shuffles towards the door We hold on Amys
befuddled face - then
EXT NYU - DAY
Virgil feels his way down the steps - Amy
rushing out after him
AMY
Im going to call Aaron -
get him to recommend
someone else
VIRGIL
Hes right Amy Ive got
to do this on my own No
one taught you how to see
Virgil starts walking stiffly towards the
street Amy hurries after him - grabs him just
as he was about to step into traffic
AMY
I was a baby then - I had
years to learn - you dont
- you need to
(anxious)
--we dont even know what
to do - where to start
Virgils hand goes out - brushes a mailbox
VIRGIL
Whats this - this thing
Amy looks over

AMY
(shrugs)

What - its a mailbox
VIRGIL

What color is it
AMY

Blue

Virgil stares at it - tries to take it in

VIRGIL

Blue OK good - thats a

mailbox - its blue There

- weve started
She says nothing Virgil senses her
apprehension
AMY Lets just get a cab get you home - and
tonight we can work on it

(hand out)
Cab
A cab veers across traffic - pulls up to them
VIRGIL

I want to walk I want to
see whats out there

AMY
Fine Lets walk
VIRGIL
Dont you have a job
AMY
Im going to make time for
this I promise
VIRGIL
Go to work If I need you -
I have your number
A beat she looks to Virgil then climbs into
the cab and it pulls away
Virgil looks left right - trying to decide
where to start his journey when we see the cab
back up in front of him and Amy climbs out
AMY
Screw work - lets go try
those eyes

Virgil - determined to see - making his way
down a street - trying to dodge people coming
at him from all angles Amy walks a short
distance behind him - coaxing him along
HIS POV - people seem to explode out of two
dimensions into three This is clearly
exhausting
AARON (CONTD)
- and his progress with
depth of field has been
especially slow
WHAM - Virgil collides with a kid ona
skateboard - Amy winces as he quickly regains
his balance - shakes it off - starts his
journey again - determined
EXT BROADWAY - STREET VNNDORS - DAY
Amy trying to help Virgil take in the
confusion of images - explaining to him items
hanging about the stalls Its clear hes a
little overwhelmed - when something familiar
catches his eye He moves toward it
HIS POV - focusing - trying to give it shape -
its a YELLOW CAB - just like the one Amy
drove off in - again he focuses - reaches out
- surprisingly wrapping his hand around the
car
AARON (CONTD)
Virgil is still very
reliant on his touch to
interpret objects in his
surroundings -
He then realizes its a porcelain toy froma
souvenir shop Amy watches him examine it like
a child as we hear
EXT STREET CORNER - DAY
AARON (CONTD)
- and his understanding of
three dimensionality is
extremely limited and
confounding to him
Virgil - his hands all over a small long
haired TERRIER He looks to Amy as he stands
VIRGIL
Its a dog
Amy on her cellphone - trying to get work done
- nods - yes thats a dog Virgil looks back
at the pup - which has now turned around
backwards
VIRGIL
Now whats that
On Amy - disturbed by his slow progress
EXT GARDEN MARKET - ANOTHER DAY
Amy and Virgil being led through a series of
plants and trees by a
EARTHY SALESWOMAN
SALESWOMAN
I believe we have just the
tree youre looking for
your lobby Needs very
little light - slow growing
- ah here we are
Amy and Virgil stop at a large Ficus Tree
AMY
Nice Good What do you
think Virgil
AARON (CONTD)
He is also still having
great difficulty
scanning basically
putting a whole picture
together
Virgil stares at the large tree Up - down -
up - down - up - down - up - down - Amy and
the Saleswoman watch him Amy wants to help
but cant comprehend what hes going through
AARON (CONTD)
If he looks at the top of a
tree - then scans to the
bottom - hes forgotten the
top by the time he reaches
the trunk
INT AMYS WORK - DAY
ANGLE ON Virgil in Amys office - staring at a
construction sign - FUTURE HOME OF etc
Using his finger to outline the letters of the
sign - he tries to read the word FUTURE He
mouths the letters - tries to form the word
AARON (CONTD)
This includes the ability
to read In reading a word
- he forgets the first
letter by the time he gets
to the last
Amy working with a draftsman - glances up to
see Virgil struggling with reading
INT NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL - LECTURE ROOM - DAY
Bathed in a bank of lights Aaron at the
podium continuing Virgil quiet - is seated
behind him
AARON (CONTD)
-- meaning he has a
total lack of visual
memory This is an
unexpected physiological
flaw We are hopeful Virgil
can overcome this
(beat)
Thank-you - thats all for
today
INT NEW YORK EYE HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY
Virgil and Amy exit the hall are immediately
surrounded by REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS
Theres a sudden FLASH Virgil reacts pulling
away

about your progress - and
were wondering what your
expectations are
As Virgil stops - stunned by the lights in his
face As he looks to Amy we cut to
INT HOME - LATE DAY
TV MONITOR - Virgil turns to camera - starts
talking to the reporter As we pull back we
hear less and less as we reveal a modest
living room A TEENAGER doing homework on a
table in the corner and a MAN - early 60s
rugged - sitting on a couch watching the news
MAN
Oh my God
He leans forward - his interest piqued and he
picks up the phone

AMY
(beat)

OK weve been invited to a

party - Duncans birthday
An ITALIAN WAITER appears - putting a large
plate of spaghetti in front of Virgil and Amy
Virgil is a little repulsed by what he sees

VIRGIL
Whats this - looks like
worms

AMY

Its spaghetti - its fine
As Virgil tries to maneuver his fork - Amy
reaches behind her
AMY
I brought you a present -

Duncan puts his hands on her shoulders -
starts to knead them Amy starts to relax
AMY
Do you ever wonder why you
do the things you do
DUNCAN
Didnt get what you
expected did you
AMY
Sometimes I think hes not
going to make it - that
hes never going to be able
to see
DUNCAN
Amy - listen to me You
liked this guy - I saw
that You wanted to help
him - it didnt work out so
hot You cant punish
yourself Sometimes things

grater Virgil stares again Ethan mimes
grating cheese
VIRGIL
Cheese grater
ETHAN
Yes - my man
Ethan holds up something new - one of those
strange spaghetti strainers Now they are both
staring at something they dont understand
Virgil looks to Ethan
ETHAN

VIRGIL
(laughing)
Youre no help How am I
supposed to do my homework

ETHAN
Homework - dude - I aint

Virgil continues to look at the strainer as
Ethan gravitates towards his cane folded up on
the table
ETHAN
(beat)
Youre lucky you got a
cane
Virgil looks over - sees his fascination
VIRGIL
You want it Ive been
thinking about throwing it
out
Ethans up in a flash
ETHAN
Man - really - I can have
it Cool
(picking it up)
I could be a Ninja Darth
Vader fighter with one of
these - protect my mom from
the evil super
Virgil is up - with the spaghetti strainer in
his hand
VIRGIL
But first youll have to
fight off the evil ---
whatever this is
As they joust about - Virgil enjoying himself
- theres a knock at the door
VIRGIL
Could be the super - go for
cover
As Ethan ducks behind the couch Virgil makes
his way to the door fumbling with the handle
- he opens it to
JENNIE Virgil stares at her We soon realize
he has no idea who this is

VIRGIL
Yes
Jenny looks at him her eyes welling
JENNIE

Virgil - its me
And suddenly Ethan is there - cane drawn like
a sword
ETHAN
En garde
Jennie startled - looks to Ethan then Virgil

Virgil and Jennie standing across the street
from a building being torn down Hard hatted
WORKERS hover about the large trucks at work
VIRGIL
You want to tell me what

Father
Virgil looks in the direction shes pointing -
tries to focus on a figure moving across the
lot The MAN we saw watching TV
VIRGIL
I cant - I cant see him
Jennie looks to him

JENNIE
I thought your eyes were
better

VIRGIL

No I - I dont want to see

Virgil takes a step back
JENNIE
Hes our father He heard
about the operation and
hes asked to see you Look

and starts of f down the street leaving Jenny
alone
INT AMYS BUILDING - NIGHT
Amy making her way up the stairs - roll of
plans under her arm Opening her door to
INT AMYS LOFT - NIGHT
A totally dark room She drops her things
AMY
Virgil Virgil
She flicks on the light - to reveal Virgil has
been sitting in the dark She looks over -
sees the scattered blocks on the floor
VIRGIL
Im here I forget about
the lights sometimes
AMY

- maybe we should just
VIRGIL
Its your partners

meet your friends right
AMY
Yeah Right
INT LOFT - NIGHT
Noisy crowded - PEOPLE mill about carrying
drinks - black and silver balloons float about
the ceiling Moving through the crowd - music
blasting - Amy introducing people to Virgil
over the noise
A WAITER walks up to them holding a tray of
wine
WAITER
Glass of wine Red - white
Amy reaches out - takes one
VIRGIL
Which is the red
Amy looks at the waiter - then points to one
Virgils hand reaches out slowly - hovering -
its clear its confusing - trying to separate
out one glass The Waiter looks to Amy like
is he OK
AMY
Virgil - here let me
Her hand darts in front of his
VIRGIL
(quick)
No Sorry - I mean - Im
almost there - I think I
got it
And she backs off as his hand wraps around a
glass - pulling it back At the last second
knocking over two other glasses
VIRGIL
Dammit Sorry
The Waiter - trying not to spill on himself
WAITER
Trust me - youre not the
first - or probably the
last Let me get a cloth
VIRGIL
Thanks
The Waiter smiles - and as he walks off
Virgil nervously takes a large drink of wine
WAITER
I hope youre driving
Suddenly from the front of the room -
MARSHALL the host calls out
MARSHALL
OK Hes coming up the
stairs Everybody get ready
- kill the lights
Excitement - a buzz - Virgil looks around then
CLICK - all the lights go out Virgil panics
momentarily
VIRGIL
What - whats happening
Amy moves to him in the near dark room
AMY
Its for the surprise -
they turned off the lights
VIRGIL
Surprise - yeah
And suddenly the lights flood back on
everyone screams SURPRISE
Duncan - at the door with Betsy - genuinely
surprised - catches his breath - then fakes a
quick heart attack and drops to the floor
The room explodes in laughter - Amy included
This action is even more confusing to Virgil
VIRGIL
Is he OK
Hearing this - everyone breaks into bigger
laughter - Virgil now the focus of attention -
good naturedly laughs - Amy smiles
embarrassed Virgil takes a gulp of his wine
finishing it off
LATER
The Music is cranked Many couples dance
Virgil exits the bathroom - glances back in
the mirror again at his hair - not sure he
likes its style He tries brushing it to the
other side - its OK How about the other way
- not so bad - maybe Its clear hes a little
tipsy as he keeps playing with his hair
WAITER (0S)
Here ya go Virgil
Virgil turns - the Waiter stands there holding
a glass of wine - placing it carefully into
Virgils hand
VIRGIL
Cheers Kevin
AMY (0OS)
(over the noise)
Virgil
Virgil embarrassed turns - can faintly hear
Amys voice over the music Searches the room
- bopping bodies - balloons being bashed round
- lights dim The number of drinks hes had
isnt helping
AMY
Virgil--over here
Amy standing with Duncan and Betsy
DUNCAN
Maybe hes blind again

Duncan pulls Amy in close to talk - shutting
Virgil and Betsy out

BETSY
Amy said you had great
hands

VIRGIL

(laughs)
She did did she
Virgil holds them up in front of his face -
tries to see them Then looks past them and
watches Amy and Duncan - more importantly
looks at Duncans hair his clothes Its
clear hes becoming aware of appearances His
own especially
As they break their tete a tete
BETSY
You know my father was
blind for several years he
had cataracts as well
Somehow this comes out patronizing
VIRGIL
Really Im surprised I
dont know him Its a club

Kevin the African American waiter comes up
KEVIN

Yes
Virgil throws his arm around Kevin
VIRGIL
Kevin - Duncan here the
birthday man - could use

KEVIN

Virgil looks to Amy

VIRGIL
Whats that look

AMY

VIRGIL

Ive never seen your face

that way before Its

-weird What does it mean
Before she can answer - a dance song breaks
out - Betsy wraps her arm around Duncans

BETSY

Come on Duncan - lets

dance - move those old

bones
Duncan only acknowledges Betsys contact with
a raised eyebrow to Amy

DUNCAN
What the hell its my
birthday -- nice to meet
you Virgil - see you at the

opening
And theyre gone onto the floor Virgil
watches him - sees the ease with which Duncan
moves handles things
VIRGIL
Opening
AMY
The lobby we designed
Virgil - you cant
VIRGIL
Lets dance
Virgil takes her arm and pulls her out on the
floor Amy - ready for one of Virgils wild
dances takes hold of his hand The music
blaring Virgil starts to get into it - Amy
starting to relax - then Virgil slowly notices
how everyone else is dancing - more
conservative
Hes even getting some looks from people
Slowly he winds down - tries to mimic what
everyone else is doing - ends up in just a
slow shuffle
Amy watches him - sees hes uncomfortable -
moves to him - but Virgil turns on his heel
and strides away Amy follows after him
INT LOFT - CORNER - NIGHT
Virgil stands near the glass doors leading to
an outdoor balcony Amy comes up to him -
finds Virgil facing a wall - eyes shut
AMY
What are you doing
Virgils head cocks slightly towards her -
just like when he was blind
VIRGIL
I feel like Rip Van Winkle
Ive woken up from a thirty
year sleep - and the
worlds passed me by
AMY
Its just dancing Who
cares
Virgil whirls on her - his hand on her
shoulder to steady his look at her
VIRGIL
No-no-no-no Its not the
Goddamn dancing I wanted
to come here tonight - show
you I could fit in Like
the big boys do Big seeing
boys Yes Well I dont

AMY
Its just going to take

VIRGIL
No - I - me shouldnt have
come You want me to see —
but you know what - you

belong in the wonderful
world of seeing
Amy reaches out to him
AMY
Virgil look
Amy realizes what she just said - Virgil pulls
his arm away
VIRGIL
No I wont Im tired of
looking Fuck looking and
the horse it came in on
And he spins to get away from her and takes a
step crashing right into the sliding glass
door which explodes in a shower of little
crystals
The party slams to a halt - Amy stands
stunned Virgil shaken - tiny cuts on his
face
AMY
Oh my God are you alright
Virgil slams his eyes shut
VIRGIL
Yeah Im just fine Take
me home
INT AMYS LOFT - NEXT MORNING
Virgil small nicks on his face wakes up -
rolls over - feels the empty bed beside him
Looks up to see Amy pulling her coat on -
suitcase at her side

AMY
Didnt want to wake you

VIRGIL
Youre going

AMY
Ill only be a couple of
days

VIRGIL
This isnt working

AMY

What - were not working -
your eyes - whats not

working

VIRGIL
I get up every morning - I
look in the mirror - and I

stare at a total stranger
I stare and I stare - and
no matter how hard I look -
I dont see Virgil there
anywhere And the more I
look at you

AMY
What You dont see me

VIRGIL
I saw you better when I was
blind

AMY
Well youre not blind any
more Im sorry if that
disappoints you
(beat)
Ive got a plane to catch
Im going to go before we
say things we dont mean
And she grabs her bag and is out the door As
we hold on Virgils face
AT THE WINDOW - Virgil looking out - watching
Amy get in the cab
As she drives away we see Virgil watch the car
recede - then his hand goes out
HIS POV - his hand grasping at the tiny
disappearing cab - trying to hold onto it like
in Times Square - trying not to let it go
INT FALK BOARD ROOM - DAY
CLOSE ON - Amys sketches The Mall has been
integrated into the two large trees - giving
it shelter and shape
FALK (0OS)
I love it
Amy and Duncan sit across from Falk a man in
his 40s - earned everything hes got - no
bullshit kinda guy
FALK
But we already cut those
trees down
EXT NYU CAMPUS - DAY
Kids milling about A young couple neck
unabashedly against a wall
We see this is Virgils POV - hes watching -
people together
INT NYU HALLWAY - DAY
Virgil makes his way down the hall Stops at
an open doorway - a sign next to it with
raised letters in Braille As his hand feels
across it - he also reads the visual letters -
Dr Ray Webster
Peering inside - he sees a Lab - full of the
NEWLY BLIND - some TEENAGERS - a couple of
ADULTS - a handful of SEEING IMPAIRED - all
learning to use a cane The rapid tapping of
their cane like a room full of typewriters
Virgil watches - the Blind working their way
around a small obstacle course - many of them
running into desks tables - its tough
frustrating work
Suddenly Virgil feels someone next to him
Webster
WEBSTER
You want to join us
Virgil watches the blind
VIRGIL
No - no - Ill wait for you
out here - when youre
done
As Virgil moves off to a hallway bench
WEBSTER
VIRGIL
Virgil turns as Webster tosses his something
Virgil misses it - it hits the ground - he
reaches down - finding it he picks it up -
its an apple He looks to Webster who smiles
back at him
WEBSTER
Ill be done in a minute
INT HOTEL LOBBY - ATLANTA - DUSK
Amy and Duncan walk through the lobby to their
rooms A little combo plays music in the
adjacent bar - a few people on the tiny dance
floor
AMY
Youd think he would have
told us I mean those trees
were in the photos
DUNCAN
Well just have to win him
over tomorrow Let me buy
you a drink - get those
creative juices going
AMY
(looks at her
watch)
Aw - no - I really
But Duncan has her by the arm - and in one
spin has her in a dance embrace This move
seems comfortable familiar to them both
DUNCAN
Cmon - listen theyre
playing our song
AMY
(laughs)
Mack the Knife was our
song
INT WEBSTERS LAB - LATER
Webster is cleaning up after class Virgil
watching some of the Teenage kids and Adults
find their way out of the room As the last of
them leaves
WEBSTER
OK - Im just about done
here - I got a place for
you - relax those eyes a
bit
INT STRIP CLUB - NIGHT
A table front and center Some empty beer
glasses in front of them Two full ones in
their hands - theyre both a little in their
cups A STRIPPER grinds and weaves her way
about the small dance floor to the sounds of
Talking Heads Burning down the House
VIRGIL
(eyeing the girl)
You want to know the truth
-- Gods honest truth
Seeings been the shits
WEBSTER
You got to be kidding me
son You can say that -
sitting here in these prime
viewing seats Forget
fixing your eyes - were
going to get your head
examined

VIRGIL
Im serious I was better
off blind People dont
have these expectations of
you you cant live up to
Youre blind - fine - they
deal with it
WEBSTER
Didnt get what you
expected did you
VIRGIL
When I was blind - I had an
image of what everything
was up here
(points to his
head)
now - its all different -
not at all what Id
expected - not what Id
hoped for
WEBSTER
Virgil let me explain
something here When you
were blind - you dealt with
things one at a time -
sequentially right A wall
led to a door to a tree to
a car Thats how you got
to what you wanted - right
(beat)
Seeing people - for better
or worse - deal with
everything all at once -
taking in the whole picture
- which sometimes confuses
the hell out of what they
want
(beat)
Virgil my advice after
three beers - dont be
afraid to take in the whole
picture - just dont lose
sight of what you want
VIRGIL
What I want is to make it
work with Amy

WEBSTER
And what does she have to

say
VIRGIL

She just wants me to see
WEBSTER

Its that important is it
VIRGIL

You know what I learned a

long time ago Seeing girls

like seeing guys

(beat)

Im not going to let her

down
INT HOTEL BAR - NIGHT 102
Amy and Duncan are dancing - they seem good
together Nothing fancy - but they move as one
about the floor

DUNCAN
See - not so bad

AMY
Not so bad

DUNCAN
Its nice to dance together
again

AMY
Yeah

DUNCAN
You remember

AMY

First time we danced -

leaves turn - so much to
see - Id love to go back

DUNCAN
So would I

(beat)

What happened to us Amy
Youre so intent on fixing
everything - whyd you give
up on us

AMY
I learned some things cant
be fixed We got married
for all the wrong reasons
I dont think I fell in
love with you as much as I
fell in love with
architecture

DUNCAN

(serious)

I never fell in love with
architecture - but I know I
fell in love with you

AMY
Now - thats bullshit

DUNCAN
It used to work
They smile at each other - everythings easy
right now - pause - they dance - Amy looks up
at Duncan - who hesitates - then leans in and
kisses her
A moment and Amy pulls away slightly - looks
down for a second - then she leans back in and
they kiss again We hold on this kiss then
cut to
INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
BLACK - we hear movement - then a light comes
on in the bathroom Amy stands there clutching
her clothes - staring into the mirror In the
background we see Duncan curled up asleep in
bed
Amy stares at herself long and hard

AMY
(whisper)

Oh God
And she starts to dress
DUNCAN
Amy - whats going on -

what time is it
Click - he flicks the bedside lamp on -
squinting - finds Amy She doesnt talk -
keeps dressing
DUNCAN
Whats wrong
AMY

an important meeting
tomorrow

DUNCAN
Ive got - hold on here -

AMY
(flat)
For the meeting
DUNCAN

Of course for the meeting
Dressed she moves toward the doorway - Duncan
sits up in bed
AMY
Im going home
DUNCAN
To be a babysitter
She stops at the door
AMY
Cant we for once be adults
- face the fact that weve
just made a colossal error
DUNCAN
Fine - this was stupid
there - happy - but
goddamit Amy - I still care
about you Where do you
actuallv think any of this
is going to lead with this
guy
AMY
I dont know - but the one
good thing to come of this
mess tonight - I know I
want to find out
And shes gone - WHAM
EXT AMYS LOFT - DUSK
A cab pulls up - Amy gets out - looks up at
her loft - its dark
INT AMYS LOFT - DUSK
Kitchen light on - a pile of Ethans blocks on
the table Amy makes her way over to see it
reads
ON THE ROOF
EXT AMYS ROOF - DUSK
Amy opens the door and sees Virgil leaning
against the parapet wall staring out at the
night Manhattan skyline After a moment he
walks back to the other end of the roof turns
and slowly walk - toward the parapet wall
again - all the time staring at the skyline -
with a smile and look of amazement on his
face
AMY
Hi
Virgil turns - finds her
VIRGIL
Hey
Amy starts toward Virgil
AMY
Whatcha doing
VIRGIL
Its the craziest thing
You start back over there -
focus on a building And
when you walk towards it -
it changes - each step
makes it look different I
started out just looking
for the horizon
AMY
You cant see it from here
- too many buildings
VIRGIL
But its still there - even
though you cant see it -
right You gotta have faith
its there Things exist
beyond what I can see - I
just have to take it on
faith
She comes

AMY There

up next to him - Virgil looking out
over the wall turns to her -

VIRGIL
You have so many looks

s something I have to tell you
was getting confused - which is no excuse for

how Ive acted but

Amy moves

VIRGIL
Wait - no - this isnt your
fault - Im the ones been
a shit Youre too hard on
yourself - expect too much
of yourself

AMY
Virgil

VIRGIL

(stopping her)

Let me say this Every day
of my life - Ive wished
for just one thing

AMY
To see

VIRGIL
To be whole For just one
month For just one day or
one minute For one
goddamned half a second
And not just to be able to
run or ride a bike or
drive a car

(beat)

But for once not to have a
bruise from bumping into
something or to stand in a
room and have to ask is
anyone here and here that
dead silence knowing
someone is there Not to
have food on my sweater or
have to put my finger in my
glass to know when its
full I just want to be
whole

(beat)
I went to see my father the
other day

toward him

VIRGIL
I couldnt face him I felt
like I was letting him
down I feel like Im
letting you down

AMY
No

VIRGIL
No listen I gave up years
ago - Im not going to give

studies her face
up now Amy - that day I
met you - for the first
time in my life I felt
someone needed me as much
as I needed them I dont
want you to give up on me
Amy out of breath - feels a surge of love for
this man - moves in kissing him A long kiss -
then
VIRGIL
Besides I couldnt leave
you - I owe too much in
back rent
And as Amy pulls him into embrace - we hold on
her face - then
INT LECTURE HALL - DAY
CLOSE ON - Dr Aaron - harsh lights washing
him out
AARON
Up until the operation five
weeks ago - Virgil had been
a touch person - someone
whos vocabulary whole
sensibility his picture of
the world was based on
tactile -- non-visual
terms
INT DOWNTOWN ATELETIC CLUB - DAY
A HEALTH INSTRUCTOR - 50s Jack LaLaine type -
is giving Virgil the tour of the facilities
They enter the weightworkout room Various
shapes and sizes of people work out on various
shapes and sizes of workout machines
Aarons voice-over continues as Jack motions
to Virgil to follow him Virgil hesitates
HIS POV - chrome iron plastic - but somehow
its more defined than weve seen before
Determined - Virgil starts his way into the
gym - hand out brushing by what he sees in
front of him
AARON (CONTD)
But - now - as a sighted
person - by focusing
singlemindedly on his goal
Virgil has a new found
ability to understand his
own physical relationship
to objects in his life
around him
Virgil now drops his hand - starts moving
through the maze of people and equipment -
actually seeing his way
AARON (CONTD)
Distance size shape -
perspective - now all have
profound meaning to him
EXT HEALTH CLUB - DAY
Virgil negotiating a glass door - exiting the
building
AARON (CONTD)
and though there are still miles to go in his
learning process - for all medical intents and
purposes - he is becoming a seeing person
Virgil walking down the street - deftly
dodging a kid on a skateboard - throwing out
his hand to hail a cab
AARON (CONTD)
This is an extraordinary
achievement and advancement
for medical science anda
tribute to Virgils
determination to see
INT LECTURE HALL - DAY
AARON (CONTD)
Ladies and Gentlemen -
Virgil Anderson
Applause and Virgil looking to Amy in the
audience stands - a seeing man - and easily
makes his way to the podium Standing in the
lights he readjusts the microphone - moving it
up from the much shorter Aaron
VIRGIL
(clears his throat)
Since this may be one of
our last sessions - are
there any questions
VOICE IN THE DARK
Mr Anderson - is there

surprised to see for the

sexy)
Tonight is your night

VIRGIL
What is it
SMASH
TO
EXT BUILDING - LATE DAY
AMY (V0)
Everything
TOP OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER
The sun starting to set - the whole of the
five burroughs of New York laid out in front
of us Virgil moves to the edge - looks out
over this amazing panorama
Amy moves up next to Virgil - they take it in
a moment
AMY
Thats the Brooklyn Bridge
Empire State Building
Chrysler building just over

ere

VIRGIL
Amy look at me

AMY

VIRGIL

This face - this is
everything Its all Ive

You have so many looks
What do all those looks
mean

AMY
Well Lets see This
(makes
corresponding face)
is sad Thisis
frustrated This is
tired This is confused
This is happy And
this
(her face softens)
is what in love looks
like
Virgil puts his hand on her face - looks at it
carefully
VIRGIL
This look - this look I

love
Amy leans forward and kisses him - and he soon
forgets it even happened As they kiss we pull
slowly back and away as the sun goes deep gold
and we start to hear what sounds like rain
We cut to
INT AMYS LOFT - NIGHT
And they are still kissing - and we realize
they are in the shower - together - kissing -
exploring - very sensual As Virgil moves to
kiss her neck - her breasts - Amys head tilts
back in to the spray

AMY

Virgil - its raining
And he moves up again - looks her in the eyes
- and for a moment his eyesight shudders ever
so slightly - it goes away and they kiss
again
EXT AMYS LOFT - MORNING
Amy and Virgil on the street - each hailing
separate cabs
AMY
So - eight oclock tonight
VIRGIL

Eight oclock - building

opening - I havent

forgotten
She blows him a kiss and shes gone Virgil
watches her cab pull away - clear something is
bothering him
HIS POV - his vision going in and out Then
clear then clouded again
INT DOWNTOWN ATHLETIC CLUB - DAY
Virgils massage room Not as organized as he
had at Bear Mtn Virgil is working on an
OVERWEIGHT MAN - his back is splotchy from too
much sun
Virgil massaging - becomes preoccupied with
his skins imperfections - losing his
concentration

OVERWEIGHT MAN
Hey Virgil - Im the one
supposed to fall asleep
here
VIRGIL
Yes - sorry
He closes his eyes - gets back into his
rhythm
INT ATHLETIC CLUB - LATER
Virgil pack over his shoulder leaving for the
day - about to cut through the weight room -
when it suddenly comes to a halt
His POV - his vision fading in and out - and
then suddenly quick flashes of black On the
final BLACK
We smash to
INT NEW YORK HOSPITAL - DAY
Virgil at the desk The Nurse looks up
VIRGIL
Daphne - I need to see Dr
Aaron - right away Its an
emergency
INT NEW YORK HOSPITAL - EXAM ROOM - DAY
Dr Aaron is again examining Virgil on the
Electroretinogram Done Aaron pulls the
machine out of the way Looks at Virgil - rubs
his hand across his face

VIRGIL
What does that mean

AARON
What

VIRGIL

What you just did
Virgil imitates him

AARON
It means - the machine is
only registering sparks of
activity - retinal sparks -
followed by nothing How
long has this been going
on

VIRGIL
I dont know - first I
thought I was tired - some
blurs - occasional
cloudiness but its been
getting worse Today Im
getting complete blackouts

AARON
Your retinal function is
down ten percent Im
afraid - your retinal
disease seems to have
returned

VIRGIL
Youre afraid What does
that mean - I thought you
corrected it You told me I
was a seeing person

AARON
Now youve every right to
be upset Maybe you didnt
have the blood vessels to
supply enough oxygen to the

retinas - Possibly some
trauma - there are so many
variables (beat) to be

honest I dont know I
wish to God I did
Virgil stands anxious - starts pacing
VIRGIL
OK Youre the expert Tell
me - what do we do now -—
how do we repair this
AARON
Virgil I -- I wish there
was a nice way to say this
Virgil backs away - doesnt want to hear it
VIRGIL
No - there is no nice way
to say it is there No nice
way to let the man know
its all over - that hes
going blind again

AARON
Virgil I understand
what

VIRGIL

No you dont Dont ever

say that Youll never

understand Ever
Aaron stands there - says nothing - tries to
let Virgils anger dissipate A long moment

VIRGIL
How long
AARON
Hard to say Month - few
weeks -
(beat)
Days

Virgil stands there stunned - then looking to
Aaron
VIRGIL

God what do I tell Amy

What do I tell her
On Virgils face
INT EYE INSTITUTE HALLWAY - DAY
Virgil steps into the hall - Sees
A FIVE YEAR OLD BOY - blind - eyes half shut -
hands reaching out plodding it a half circle
over to where his mother waits for him
And we see the realization on Virgils face of
seeing his past - and what he will return to
EXT STREETS - DAY
Virgil RUNNING RUNNING best he can - through
the crowded street - hands out - bumping into
people - desperate - scared - trying to run
from himself - from his fate
WHAM - he comes to a stop - out of breath - he
looks left - right - where do you go - then
sees something off screen His face torn with
fear - he moves forward - hand out - reaching
to a window - to his own REFLECTION
And we push slowly in on the reflection as he
touches the window - his hand on his face - a
face he may never see again - and a cloud
passes overhead and his reflection is gone
EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY
Virgil stands at the site - amidst the rubble
and mud His Father walks slowly over to him -
raising his arms to embrace him

Virgil takes a step back - not ready - his
father stops understands - looks his son up
and down

FATHER
You look good Hey - how do
I look

VIRGIL

I need some answers Whyd
you leave Because Im
blind - or because I quit
trying to see
FATHER
To the point - I like that
- something you got from
me
VIRGIL
Cut the bullshit - dad I
dont hear from you for
over twenty years - then
you find out I can see and
all of a sudden you show
up
FATHER
(looks around)
Hey Virge - can we talk
about this later huh
VIRGIL
No not later Now Was my
blindness so wrong that
made you tear our family
apart
Virgils riled his father He steps towards
Virgil tries to speak under his breath
FATHER
Every morning I woke up and
looked at you and saw my
own failures If I couldnt
get my own son to see
thenWhat difference does
any of this make - you can
see now - hell I knew you
could
Virgil watches his father - this stranger His
eyes start to well
VIRGIL
Im going blind again
His Father looks at him - stunned He reels
from the news - takes a step back
FATHER
No
VIRGIL
The doctor told me today
Youre the first person
Ive told I wanted to come

see you before it was
completely gone
FATHER
(speechless)
A beat and Virgils father takes another step
back then turns and walks away - forever
EXT NEW BUILDING - LATE DAY
Virgil standing across the street Trying to
take in the building

Standing at the front as a security guard
opens the door
GUARD

open until tonight
VIRGIL
I know Im Virgil
Andersonwith Roswell
Tremont We did the lobby

details for tonight
GUARD
Oh okay sure Mr
Anderson
INT LOBBY - LATE DAY
The lobby is pretty straightforward Open - a
few plants - a large central check in desk
Simple - unobtrusive - nothing exceptional or
unique
Virgil moves his way about the lobby - looking
at it carefully from every possible angle -
his hand grazing across walls entranceways —-
desperately committing as much as he can to
memory - finally ending up in the middle of
the room in a final attempt to absorb as much
as he can
GUARD (0OS)
You want to see that the
thing work
VIRGIL
Thing What thing
GUARD
This thing
The Guard reaches over - hits a switch - and
against one section of windows a wall of water
comes dripping down - causing a shower of
indoor rain - the sound instantly echoing off
of the walls
Virgil smiles - moves toward it - closing his
eyes - listening to the indoor rain - really
taking in the room having total empathy with
what Amy has created
INT AMYS LOFT - BATHROOM
Virgil wrapped in a towel is shaving But he
has his eyes closed Amy comes in dressed
beautifully - using the mirror to put her
earrings in Virgil quickly opens his eyes
VIRGIL
You nervous
AMY
No - not a bit What do you
think
She pivots for him
VIRGIL
You look great
AMY
Really Not too flashy
(she looks in the
mirror she is
nervous)

Virgil lets her go - calls to her
VIRGIL
This is an important night
for you
AMY
But you know whats most
important
(she pokes her head
in)
That youre going to be
there to see it
Virgil turns to the mirror stares at himself
- contemplating what hes up against
INT NEW BUILDING - NIGHT
The lobby is filled with business types
waiters circulating with champagne tiny hors-
doeuvres Virgil and Amy enter - standing at
the top of the stairs leading to the party
Virgil immediately going into a performance
for Amy
AMY

the detail - planted pots
in the corners the
moldings
(beat)
Its got genuine lines
AMY
(excited)
Look around - do you see
it
VIRGIL
What
He looks about the room - then turns towards
the indoor rain
HIS POV - clear - then slight haziness - a
momentary flash of black - then back in focus
He turns to Amy Puts his arm around her
VIRGIL
Our rain
AMY
Your rain

DUNCAN

Hey Virgil
He extends his hand Virgil
extends his - having trouble

obliged slowly
focusing - but

Duncan helps him - taking hold of it and

shaking it

DUNCAN

VIRGIL

AMY
Ill be right back

Theres

food and drinks down on the

floor

Duncan and Amy start down the stairs as Virgil

tries to find a safe place to stand His

eyesight fading in and out -

he looks around

decides to negotiate the steps
He takes one step on the stairs - looks down

is able to see Amy with Falk

and Duncan

looking up at him - she smiles - he does his

best - smiles back - lets go
takes another step - finally
bottom floor

He stands there for a long moment - lost as to

of the handrail
reaching the

where to move A glimpse towards the rain
sculpture and he starts towards it using the

sound to help guide him

Amy looks over - sees Virgil moving across the

floor - gives him a little wave - he doesnt

notice her

At the rain Virgil stands taking in the sound

A FIGURE comes up next to him
VIRGIL
Quite a party Love the
detail of the building
WEBSTER
Sometimes the detail

doesnt matter

Virgil stops - turns to Webster
VIRGIL
Ray What are you doing
here

WEBSTER
Aaron called me He was
worried Ive been trying
to find you - Amys office

VIRGIL
Its almost gone Last few
days have been pretty bad

WEBSTER
Obviously Amy doesnt know

VIRGIL
Its going to break her
heart This is her big
night - I didnt want to
ruin it Thought I could
pull it off

WEBSTER

(beat)
You cant avoid this
forever
Virgil turns back towards the rain

VIRGIL

I know
(beat)

So Ray Is it better to
have seen and lost than
never to have seen at all

WEBSTER
I thought it was loved and
lost
Amy comes up to them
AMY
Dr Webster - this is a
surprise
WEBSTER

Virgil invited me - wanted
to show you off I think

The place is terrific -

proud

AMY

for a moment - schmoozing
time

WEBSTER
Shmooze away

VIRGIL

(as hes led away)

Thanks Ray Ill call you

ANGLE ON - Duncan standing anxiously with Falk
and his wife Donna as they arrive
AMY
Virgil - Id like you to
meet Jack Falk and his wife
Donna up from Atlanta

VIRGIL
Pleased to meet you

DONNA
Amy tells us you were

blind
Amy spurts out a glass of wine Virgil
deflects the comment
VIRGIL
Thats OK - nice to see
someone so honest
FALK
Amy tells us youre her
inspiration Any help you
can give us with our
project
VIRGIL
Im a little biased but I
kind of liked Amys
original design
FALK
But could we do better
Amy jumps in with
AMY
We could do better Mr
Falk - a lot better
FALK
Good I like that attitude
Lets keep trying for
perfection
Everyone smiles - Amy wraps her arm around
Virgil

AMY
Thats right - thats why
Ive got Virgil
Pleasant laughter all around - and as Amy and
the others continue - we push in on Virgil as
he takes in this thought
EXT NEW BUILDING - NIGHT
Virgil and Amy out front People leaving -
Duncan getting into a town car with Falk and
his wife - he looks back - gives the thumbs up
and climbs in after them The car pulls away
into the night
VIRGIL
You wanna walk - I feel
like some air
AMY
See what we see Sure
VIRGIL
Can I take your arm - eyes
a little tired
As they walk
VIRGIL
You really made the place
come alive with that
fountain
AMY
Thank-you
(beat)
You know Ive been thinking
- youre doing so great now
- and if we get this new
design job wed have some
extra money - I think we
should go on a big seeing
celebration
VIRGIL
(taken aback)
A seeing celebration
AMY
Yeah maybe in a couple of
months I looked into Egypt
- we could see the pyramids
- we could see it together
for the first time What do
you say
VIRGIL
You know - there is
something Id like to see
AMY
Of course anything
VIRGIL
The Rangers play tomorrow
Seasonll be over before we
know it - could be our last
chance
AMY
The Rangers Sure why not
BLACK
Then a tiny pinpoint of light ahead - one that
grows increasingly larger as we move towards a
SOUND A hum that grows in intensity until the
light fills the frame and BAM - we exit the
tunnel and we are
INT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT
That glorious first view - people - the white
ice shining below like a giant jewel- and the
players - in bright colors scurrying about the
playing surface below
AMY
This is amazing - isnt it
She looks to Virgil who is awed by what he is
seeing Then suddenly on his face - a flash -
one of those moments of darkness
AMY
Should we find our seats
Looks like the games
already started
VIRGIL
Yeah - I - Ill follow you
INT GARDEN - SEATS - LATER
Virgil and Amy in the loge seats - on the
aisle - up behind the goal Amy looking at the
stadium while Virgil next to her watches the
game best he can
AMY
I love the stadium the way
its structure
VIRGIL
Amy - the game
AMY
Right - the game
SMASH - a hard check into the boards deep in
the Rangers end of the ice The puck squirts
out Gretzky picks it up - fires it across ice
- one two its back to him and he has a wide
open break from center ice - the crowd is out
of their seats - Virgil included - Amy quickly
getting caught up in the enthusiasm
On Virgils face - watching Gretzky skate
towards him - excited - then losing him -
another flash of blackness - like a blow to
the head - and we hear the crowd suddenly
explode - and as Virgils vision regains we
see the players mobbing Wayne after his goal -
the little red light behind the net the only
evidence of it happening
We see the frustration as Virgil realizes
hell never see it

AMY
He scored he scored - you
see that - it was amazing
As the players make their way to center ice -
the crowd sits and Amy sees the expression
again on his face

AMY

What That was good right
VIRGIL

Yeah - it was great - I was

just
Suddenly Virgil becomes transfixed Walking
down the aisle away from him
A VENDOR - carrying a tray of PINK COTTON
CANDY
Virgil stares at it a moment - transfixed -
then like in a trance - he stands - stepping

out into the aisle - a man on a mission
AMY
Virgil where are you
going

And hes on the stairs - carefully moving down
the stairs toward the vendor

Then she sees the Vendor - handing Virgil a
large cotton candy - round and puffy like a
cloud - but something he can hold in his hand
Amy cant believe it - watching Virgil - his
fascination at finding this long lost memory
AMY
The puffy thing

Angle on Virgil turning - admiring his prize -

then looking up

waves to him excited

HIS POV - scanning the crowd - its hazy -

then flashes of dark

Amys face - suddenly drops - its clear

trying to find Amy - who

even

though she is only four rows up - he doesnt

see her

INT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT
Game is over - Virgil is packing up his stuff
- Amy staring at him

AMY
Virgil whats happening
VIRGIL
Just having a bad eye day
A lot to take in
AMY
Tell me Whats going on
VIRGIL
Nothing I see almost
nothing

Amy she feels like shes about to explode

AMY
Oh God

VIRGIL
Its OK

AMY
OK

VIRGIL
Its OK for you to cry

AMY

(recovering)

No no - Im not going to
cry Solve the problem We
made it through one
operation - well make it
through another We wont
give up Well get this
right - we just need to
VIRGIL
I saw Dr Aaron Theres
nothing they can do
AMY
Then well find another
Doctor Theres got to be
someone else Well find
something that works
VIRGIL
Dont you get it - I cant
go through this again
AMY
So just like that - we just
forget it - give up Why
the hell havent you told
me what was going on

VIRGIL
(whirls on her)
Because of this
AMY
What this
VIRGIL
You Not letting it go -
thinking theres a
solution Goddamit Im not
design flaw in your fucking
work that you can just
change to make work Or
throw away because it
doesnt meet your
expectations
(beat)
Lets face it - its over
AMY
Virgil give it time
youll see
VIRGIL
No I wont This
conversation is ended
INT AMYS APARTNENT - NIGHT
The door swings open - Amy and Virgil enter -
Virgil moves towards the bed - pulls out his
duffel bag

AMY
What are you doing

VIRGIL
Im leaving

AMY

What do you mean leaving -
youre leaving this
apartment - youre leaving
New York - youre leaving
me
Virgil turns - they stand across the room from
each other - miles apart
VIRGIL
Im going home
Amy walks toward him picking a battle
rejection
AMY
So youre big sister can
take care of you - feed you
TV dinners for of your
life
Virgil tries to side step her
VIRGIL
Im not going to go through
this bullshit again
Amy moves in front - confronting him
AMY
Is that what this has all
been to you - bullshit
VIRGIL
Yes Who the hell were we
fooling Im blind - Im
not meant to see - I dont
belong here

AMY
God damn right youre
blind You want to live in
your own little world -
this perfect world that
your sister built for you -
where no one can touch you

where no one can reach

you

VIRGIL
Do you know the reason why
I remembered the cotton
candy all those years
Because I went to the game
with my father And its
the only good thing I can
remember about him The
rest is him pushing me to
be something Im not - then
turning his back on me the
minute his plans fail

AMY
I am not turning my back on
you You want me to give up
on you - you love the self
pity

VIRGIL
I dont want you to give up
on ME But you wont give
up on me seeing

AMY
Because there must be other
options

VIRGIL

Not anymore
Virgil avoiding her sidesteps quickly past
her - straight into the lamp which crashes to
the ground and breaks
DARKNESS
VIRGIL
Dammit
A short few steps then a much larger crash -
the sound of a large heavier thing breaking
AMY
Virgil
my feels her way to the lights - and turns
em on We see that Virgil has collided with
mys sculpture of the woman He sits among
e pieces on the floor
Virgil - feeling the damage
AMY
(going to him)
Is anything broken

A
t
A
t
VIRGIL
No - no bones are broken
Virgil uses the wall to stand - then - with
his hands out in front of him he finds his way
to the bed
VIRGIL
Its finished - cant you
see that We both didnt
get what we wanted
AMY
(quietly)
I never meant to hurt you
VIRGIL
When you asked me to come
here - did you ever think
this wasnt going to work -
that for one minute I may
not be able to see
(beat)
Did you ever think it would
be OK to have a
relationship with a blind
man
Amy - a pause Too long
VIRGIL
Theres my answer
And he grabs his duffel and pack - throws the
last few things in - and moving to the door -
leaves
INT BUS - NIGHT - RAINING
Virgil riding - crossing the George Washington
Bridge - going home He looks out the window -
sees the receding city - and he closes his
eyes - listens to the rain
EXT PINECREST - MAIN STREET - NIGHT
The Bus comes down the main street of
Pinecrest Stopping - the bus door opens and
Virgil gets out - and turns to face up the
street - the street he knew so well that is so
foreign to him right now
EXT VIRGIL AND JENNIES - NIGHT
The door opens Jennie smiles warmly reaches
out to him
JENNIE
Welcome home
INT HOME - NIGHT
Virgil and Jennie entering his place - to be
greeted immediately by
SOPHIE bounding across the floor towards them
- tail wagging - tongue hanging out
VIRGIL
Sophie
And he bends down to hug her Sophie laps at
his face Virgil holds her back to get a good
look at her
VIRGIL
Let me look at you Youre
so beautiful yes
Jennie watches her brother - happy to have him
home Hoping to get him back to normal
INT VIRGILS HOME - LATER
Virgil walks around touching things seeing
the simplicity of his life Nothing on the
walls - no decorations - no plants Everything
functional He realizes this is a home
designed by his sister
He moves over to the photo of the family He
on his dads shoulders Stares at it - at his
father and mother for the first time
JENNIE
Mom and dad
Virgil just stares
JENNIE
Everythings as you left
it Nothings changed
VIRGIL
Jen - Im pretty tired -
Id like to be alone
The PHONE rings Rings again Virgil doesnt

move - his apprehension is clear - he knows
who it is Jennie sees this and moves toward
the phone

Virgil turns and walks out onto the front
porch - followed by Sophie as his sister
picks up the phone in the background

EXT VIRGILS PORCH - NIGHT

He sits down - looks into the night as we hear
Jennie faintly on the phone A beat and she
hangs up We hold on Virgil

EXT PINECREST STREET - DAY

Virgil walks down Main street Seeing his town
- a town he grew up in but now seems so
foreign Virgil seems oddly disturbed by what
he sees

The yellow bus drives by - full of kids - Carl
at the helm Somehow its not what he
expected

INT ROSWELL-TRRMONT DESIGN FIRM - DAY

Amy organizing all her work on the Atlanta
project - - the original designs - the new
design with the trees - then she sees

The sketch she made of the dancing trees
Her eyes hold - and she slowly shuts them -
and with them tightly closed - her hand
reaches out and runs along the drawings

EXT PINECREST - END OF MAIN STREET - DAY

We find Virgil standing - looking out at the
end of the street where he stood with Amy In
front of him he sees

The dancing trees

VIRGILS POV - a retinal spark - a quick
glimpse of the intertwined trees - one lover
choosing between two others
INT FIREHOUSE - LATE DAY
Virgil - stands in the middle of the room
Looks about at what was at one time so special
to him Now it just seems old and dingy - the
magic is gone
He closes his eyes for a moment - listens -
cocks his head to the left - the right - but
there is nothing there
EXT TOWN LIBRARY - LATE DAY
Virgil standing outside - staring at a
building hes never seen - never been inside
HIS POV flickering a moment
INT LIBRARY - SUNSET
Virgil now sits at a table Stacks and stacks
of LIFE magazine splayed out in front of him
He is flipping through them at a rapid rate -
like a drowning man searching for air
IMAGES - cars JFK the pyramids Martin
Luther King houses flowers Marilyn Monroe
that Napalm burned little girl in Viet Nam
African masks Dachau prisoners Nixon Warhol
paintings the Mona Lisa that vulture
watching over the little baby the Eiffel
tower First Man on the moon the Venus De
Milo that guy in front of the tank in
Tianaman square and the Pyramids
The pictures go by fast and furious - Virgil
soaking them up like a sponge - life beauty
horror great people great events
And we move in on his face - absorbing these
images for the last time - a face filled with
anguish at a world disappearing And we cut
to
EXT AMYS ROOF - SUNSET
Golden rays of the late afternoon sun Amy on
the roof - leaning on the parapet - watching
the horizon
Then a thought comes to her And mimicking
what Virgil had done - she walks back to the
other end of the roof turns and looks out
towards the skyline again then starts
slowly walking towards the parapet till she
reaches the wall again
The reaction on her face - she doesnt see
it - not like Virgil did
INT VIRGILS HOME - DAY
Virgil is shifting furniture in his house A
table - moves it to the window - moves a chair
to join it - stands back to have a look at it
HIS POV - a moment of clear - then haze - then
dark - then haze
Virgil rubs his head - these last days of
sight have been painful and exhausting for
him

to start over
EXT PINECREST - SUNSET
Virgil walks the path Sophie following close
behind By the way he walks counting steps
touching landmarks we realize he is using
sight very little
EXT HIDDEN VALLEY - SUNSET
Coming through the clearing to the plateau
ere he took Amy the leaves now starting to
urn golden colors - he stops - stands over
op of the pond
IRGILS POV - A retinal spark The view
cross the valley with white clouds against
e bluest sky
is hand reaches out - to touch the edge of
e world - to touch the horizon
nd as he drops his hand we see the clouds
start to race by - while the blue sky goes
golden then drifts into darkness Virgil
doesnt move from the spot The screen goes
almost black - then slowly the sun starts to
rise in the east
Virgil makes no movement A long beat - then -
as the sun moves across him - he realizes its
day He stands and unfolds his cane Its
clear he has returned to being completely
blind
As he turns and starts his way down the hill
we hear

INT WEBSTERS LAB - NYU
VIRGIL (VO)

darkness when we dont look

need eyes

percussion of the city
