THIRD PRISONER (0S)

Or hes wondering why someone would
shoot a man before throwing him out
of an aeroplane

CIA Man turns to the Third Prisoner Shuts the cargo door

CIA MAN
Wiseguy huh At least you can
talk Who are you

THIRD PRISONER
We are nothing We are the dirt
beneath your feet And no one cared
who I was until I put on the
mask

CIA Man wary approaches the Third Prisoner - pulls off his
hood revealing a dark mask with a breathing apparatus The
eyes behind it are cold Still This is Bane

BANE
Who we are does not matter What
matters is our plan

CIA MAN

(FASCINATED)
If I pull this off will you die

BANE
It would be extremely painful

CIA MAN
Youre a big guy -

BANE
For you

CIA MAN

(UNNERVED)
Was being caught part of your plan

BANE
Of course Dr Pavel refused our
offer in favor of yours We had to
know what he told you about us
DR PAVEL
Nothing I said nothing

CIA MAN
Why not just ask him

BANE
He would not have told us

CIA MAN
You have methods

BANE
Him I need healthy You present no
such problem
CIA Man laughs for the Special Forces benefit A heavy bass
tone is rising The Sergeant looks out the window

EXT SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUOUS

The commuter plane is dwarfed by a massive transport plane
looming over it dangerously close

INT MAIN CABIN COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS
The plane lurches The noise is building

SERGEANT
Sir

CIA MAN
Well congratulations you got
yourselves caught Whats the next
step of your master plan
BANE
Crashing this plane

EXT MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

The ramp of the transport opens Four men leap out on
tethers - dropping towards the commuter plane two each
side

INT MAIN CABIN COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

The Spacial Forces react to the turbulence from the plane
above CIA Man looks at Bane

BANE

(RISING)
With no survivors
A Special Forces soldier spins around - an Armed Man is
outside the window Bang -

EXT SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUOUS
Two men shoot through the windows the other two attach
grapples to the fuselage - give the thumbs up - hoists start

to pull and the tail of the commuter plane is lifted
unnaturally

INT COCKPIT COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS
The Pilots battle the controls as the plane tilts forward

INT MAIN CABIN COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

Like lightning Bane has the CIA Man is his handcuffed arms
legs wrapped around a seat back The entire cabin upends
Tumbling chaos - Soldiers falling - Bane cracks CIA Mans
neck and drops him onto the Sergeant - they tumble down the
plane smashing into the cockpit door with a terminal thud
Dr Pavel strapped in pushes against the seat in front of
him - the plane vibrates trying to tear itself apart

EXT ATLAS MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

The men climb the tail of the smaller plane as it dangles
helplessly above the mountains Its wings shear off

INT MAIN CABIN COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

Bane breaks his handcuffs as if they were plastic then
opens his legs and drops down the cabin somersaulting
gracefully and using his arms to stop himself halfway down
by Dr Pavel

EXT SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUOUS

The men attach explosives to the tail then jump away
swinging out as the tail explodes

INT MAIN CABIN COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

An explosion takes off the rear door of the cabin - the
Armed Men drop through the smoke on cables

A body bag is lowered into the cabin Bane lies it on the
seat backs next to Dr Pavel and unzips it to reveal a body
the same age and build as Dr Pavel

Bane rips Dr Pavels sleeve - pulls out a length of
surgical tubing - pushes a needle into Dr Pavels arm -
runs the tube to the bodys arm Dr Pavel watches
horrified as Bane starts compressions on the bodys chest
drawing Dr Pavels blood across the tube and into the
body

An Armed Man pulls Hooded Man 1 up through the cabin and
out Bane stops Hooded Man 2

BANE
Friend They expect one of us in
the wreckage
The man nods unhooks himself takes Banes arm

HOODED MAN 2
Have we started the fire

BANE

(NODS)
The fire rises
Hooded Man 2 hands Bane his line Bane clips it around Dr
Pavel takes out a knife and cuts Dr Pavels seat belt Dr
Pavel panics flails Bane takes his arms Gentle

BANE
Calm Doctor Now is not time for
fear
Bane slides Dr Pavel out of his seat They hang in the
vertical windblown cabin Bane takes out a detonator

BANE
That comes later
Bane presses the detonator - the cabin drops from around
them revealing the terrifying drop to the peaks below Dr
Pavel screams as they are hoisted up towards the transport
and we -

EXT GOTHAM - EVENING
Drifting over the vast city

MAYOR (VO)

Harvey Dent Day may not be our

oldest public holiday

moving past the enormous Gotham Bridge

MAYOR (VO)

But were here tonight because its

one of the most important

over the Gotham river to the Palisades on the far side

MAYOR (VO)

Harvey Dents uncompromising stand

against organized crime and yes

ultimately his sacrifice have

made Gotham a safer place than it

was at the time of his death eight

years ago

finding a party in the grounds of Wayne Manor The Mayor
addresses the wealthy and powerful of Gotham

MAYOR
This city has seen a historic
turnaround No city is without
crime But this city is without
organized crime because the Dent
Act gave law enforcement teeth in
its fight against the mob Now
people are talking about repealing
the Dent Act And to them I
saynot on my watch

Enthusiastic applause as the Mayor wraps up
I want to thank the Wayne
Foundation for hosting this event
Im told Mr Wayne couldnt be here
tonight but Im sure hes with us
in spirit
High above on a darkened balcony a lone figure Watching

MAYOR (0S)
Now Im going to give way to an
important voice

Down below at the bar Commissioner Gordon examines some
sheets of densely written paper A Congressman muscles in

CONGRESSMAN
Commissioner

GORDON
Congressman

CONGRESSMAN

Ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of

these things

Gordon shakes his head Gordons Deputy Commissioner Foley
cuts in

FOLEY
No one has Not in years

MAYOR (0S)

He can tell you about the bad old

days when the criminals and

corrupt ran this town with such a

tight grasp that people put their

faith in a murderous thug in a mask

and a cape A thug who showed his

true nature when he betrayed the

trust of this great man - (Turns to

picture of Dent) And murdered him

in cold blood
The Congressman watches a tray of canap√©s breeze past then
grabs the ass of the maid carrying them She freezes

CONGRESSMAN
Sweetheart not so fast with the
chow

MAID
(turns tight smile)
Shrimp balls
The Congressman grabs two The Maid moves off The
Congressman glances down at Gordons papers

MAYOR (0S)
Jim Gordon can tell you the truth
about Harvey Dent

CONGRESSMAN
Jesus Gordon is that your speech
Were gonna be here all night

GORDON
Maybe the truth about Harvey isnt
so simple Congressman

MAYOR (0S)

But Ill let him tell you himself -

Commissioner Gordon
Applause Gordon approaches the mike Looks down at his long
speech Thinks

GORDON
The truth
INSERT CUT Harvey Dent face half destroyed threatens
Gordons son with a handgun

Gordon surveys the audience Deciding

I have written a speech telling the

truth about Harvey Dent

Gordon folds up his speech

Maybe the time isnt right

Gordon stuffs the papers inside his jacket The Congressman
mutters under his breath

CONGRESSMAN
Thank Christ for that
GORDON
Maybe right now all you need to
know is that there are a thousand
inmates in Blackgate Prison as a
direct result of the Dent Act
These are violent criminals
essential cogs in the organized
crime machine that terrorized
Gotham for so long Maybe for now
all I should say about Harvey
Dents death is thisit has not
been for nothing
The figure on the balcony turns back into the mansion
People clap as Gordon leaves the mike Gordon approaches
Foley

GORDON
The second shift reports in

FOLEY
On your desk But you should put in
some more time with the Mayor -

GORDON
Thats your department

Gordon heads for the line of town cars in the gravel drive

CONGRESSMAN
Anyone shown him the crime stats

FOLEY
He goes by his gut and it
continues to bother him whatever
the numbers

CONGRESSMAN
Must be popular with the wife

FOLEY
Not really She took the kids and
moved to Cleveland
CONGRESSMAN
Hell have plenty of time for
visits Mayors dumping him in the
spring

FOLEY
Really Hes a hero

CONGRESSMAN
War hero This is peacetime Stay

INT KITCHENS WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

Our Maid dives into the bustle of Wayne Manor below stairs -
Caterers and Maids Wait Staff She overhears another Maid

MAID 2
They say he never leaves the East
Wing

MAID 3

I heard he had an accident - that
hes disfigured

The other Maids signal her to be quiet All the chatter has
died Alfred has entered the kitchen

ALFRED
Mr Till why are your people using
the main stairs
Alfred places a glass of water on a tray next to a covered
plate Picks up the tray looks around the chaotic kitchen

ALFRED
Wheres Mrs Bolton

MAID

Shes up at the bar sir Can I

INT HALL WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

Alfred talks to an elegant woman thirties Miranda Tate

ALFRED
Im sorry Miss Tate but Ive
tried He wont see you

MIRANDA
Its important Mr Pennyworth
Her accent is European Hard to place

ALFRED
Mr Wayne is as determined to
ignore important things as trivial
ones

MALE VOICE (0S)
Dont take it personally Miranda
They turn to see a man in his fifties Daggett

DAGGETT
Everyone knows Waynes holed up in
there with eight-inch nails peeing
into Mason jars (To Alfred) Good
of you to let me on the grounds

ALFRED
The Dent Act is about all Gotham
Even you Mr Daggett Miss Tate
always a pleasure
Alfred turns and walks off Daggett smiles glib

DAGGETT
Why waste your time talking to the
man who threw away your investment
on some save-the-world vanity
project He cant help you get your
money back But I can

MIRANDA
I could try explaining that a
save-the-world project vain or
not is worth investing in
whatever the return I could try
Mr Daggett but you understand
only money and the power you think
it buys so why waste my time
indeed

She walks away Daggett watches her go

INT DRAWING ROOM EAST WING WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

Close on the dinner tray We hear a labored step approach
Bruce Wayne appears leaning on a cane Gaunt Grey temples
He lifts the lid of his dinner then freezes hearing
something He slowly limps into the next room
INT SITTING ROOM EAST WING WAYNE MANOR CONTINUOUS

The Maid looks at framed photographs of Rachel Thomas and
Martha Wayne Some are half-burned She notices an archery
target arrows stuck in it She reaches out WHAM An arrow
sticks into the target - the Maid spins around flustered
Wayne at the other end of the long room lowers a composite
bow Picks up his cane

MAID
Im Im terribly sorry Mr Wayne
It is Mr Wayne isnt it

Wayne nods gently Limps towards her

MAID
Although you dont have the long
nails (Nervous laugh) Or facial

scars
She trails off embarrassed Coy She seems very young

WAYNE
Is that what they say about me

MAID
Its just thatnobody sees you

Wayne approaches slowly He nods at her pearl necklace

WAYNE

Thats a beautiful necklace

Reminds me of the one that belonged

to my mother It cant be the same

one - her pearls are in this safe -

He reaches out with his cane to press open a panel on the
bureau revealing a safe door

- which the manufacturer clearly

explained is uncrackable

which swings open with an awkward creak

MAID
Oops No one told me it was
uncrackable

The Maid suddenly seems more confident Older

WAYNE
Im afraid I cant let you take
those

She smiles at him Moves towards him

MAID
Look you wouldnt hit a woman any
more than I would beat up a
cripple
She kicks his cane from under him smashes him down
Of course sometimes exceptions
have to be made

The Maid vaults onto the bureau and up to a high window
Goodnight Mr Wayne

She flips backwards through the window Wayne smiles then
rocks forward on his good leg and rises with athletic grace
He looks at the safe notices something Powder

EXT DRIVE WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

Moving toward the line of town cars the Maid pulls off her
white apron cuffs and collar leaving a black dress and
pearls A Valet hurries to open a car door for her - she
slips into a town carbeside the Congressman

MAID

BLAKE

was babbling about an underground
army A masked man called Bane

WAYNE
Shouldnt you be telling this to
your superior officers

BLAKE
I did One of them asked if he saw
any giant alligators down there He
needs you He needs the Batman

WAYNE
If Commissioner Gordon thinks Im
the Batman he must be in a bad way

BLAKE
He doesnt know or care who you
are (Off look) But weve met
before When I was a kid At the
orphanage See my mom died when I
was small Car accident I dont
really remember it But a couple of

of people who know what it feels
like do they To be angry In your
bones People understand foster
parents understand For a while
Then they expect the angry kid to
do what he knows he can never do
To move on To forget

Wayne stares at Blake

BLAKE
So they stopped understanding and
sent the angry kid to a boys home

Catwoman follows confused as Batman leaps off the roof
She gets to the edge pauses to look down into the alley -
sees the black angular roof of the Bat cockpit open
Shots impact around her - she leaps landing hard but
gracefully on the back of the vehicle slides into the
cockpit As the engines thunder into life and the canopy
hisses shut taking bullets from above

CATWOMAN
My mother warned me about getting
into cars with strange men -

BATMAN

ALFRED
From the look of the television
coverage you seem to have your
taste for wanton destruction back

WAYNE
(pulls out USB drive)
I retrieved this

ALFRED
Shouldnt the police be gathering
the evidence

WAYNE
They dont have the tools to
analyze it

ALFRED
They would if you gave them to them

WAYNE
One mans tool is another mans
weapon

ALFRED

In your mind perhaps But there
arent many things you couldnt
turn into a weapon

WAYNE
Alfred Enough The police werent
getting it done -

ALFRED
Perhaps they wouldve if you
havent made a sideshow of

yourself
WAYNE
Perhaps youre upset you were
wrong
ALFRED
Wrong

WAYNE

You thought I didnt have it in me
Alfred looks at him Puts down the cape and cowl

ALFRED

intending to make a life with you

WAYNE

shed chosen Harvey Dent over you
Wayne watches confused as the old man prepares to say -

ALFRED
And what if to spare you
painId burned that letter
Wayne stares at Alfred shocked

WAYNE
Why would you say such a thing

ALFRED
Because I have to make you
understand

WAYNE
Youre lying

ALFRED

Because you are as precious to me
as you were to your own mother and
father and I swore to them that I
would protect you and I havent

WAYNE
Youre lying

ALFRED
Ive never lied to you Except when
I burned Rachels letter
Wayne turns on the old man furious

WAYNE
How dare you use Rachel to stop me

ALFRED
Im using the truth Master Wayne
Maybe its time we all stopped
trying to outsmart the truth and
just let it have its day Im
sorry

WAYNE
Sorry You expect to destroy my
world then shake hands

ALFRED
No I know what this means -

WAYNE
What does it mean Alfred

ALFRED
It means your hatred It means
losing the person Ive cared for
ever since I heard his first cries
echo through this house But it
might also mean saving your life
And that is more important

Wayne looks at Alfred Furious Summons the worst thing to
say and says it quietly and calmly

Youve built a lot of security
around a damp squib

About three years ago a Russian
scientist published a paper on
weaponized fusion reactions One
week later your reactor started
developing problems (Looks at
Wayne) I think this machine works

WAYNE
Miranda if it were operational
the danger to Gotham would be too
great

MIRANDA
Would it make you feel better to
know that the Russian scientist
died in a plane crash six months
ago

WAYNE
Someone else will work out what Dr
Pavel did Someone else will figure
out how to turn this power source
into a nuclear weapon I need you
to take control of Wayne
Enterprises and this reactor

then dies to cold
MIRANDA
And to do what with it

WAYNE
Nothing Until we can find a way to
guarantee its safety

And if we cant

WAYNE
Decommission it Flood it

Bane steps to the bars - looks up at a bright opening five
hundred feet above Like being at the bottom of a gigantic
well

Hope Every man who has rotted here

over the centuries has looked up to

the light and imagined climbing to

freedom So simple So easy And

like shipwrecked men turning to sea

water from uncontrollable thirst

many have died trying I learned

that there can be no true despair

without hope (Turns to Wayne) So

as I terrorize Gotham I will feed

its people hope to poison their

souls I will let them believe they

can survive so that you can watch

them clamber over each other to

stay in the sun
Bane points to an old TV just outside the bars

You will watch as I torture an

entire city to cause you pain you

thought you could never feel again

Then when you have truly

understood the depths of your

failure we will fulfill Rs al

A
Gh 1s destiny We will destroy

U
Gotham And when it is donewhen
Gotham is ashesthen you have my
permission to die

dangerous man not the crusader for
