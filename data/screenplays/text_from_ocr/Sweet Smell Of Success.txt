THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS

FADE IN
EXT INT GLOBE NEWSPAPER BUILDING - DUSK - NY

A row of newspaper delivery trucks is lined up against the
long loading bay waiting for the edition In the foreground
a large clock establishes the time as 810 PM A rumbling
noise warns the men to take their positions a few seconds
later the bales of newspapers come sliding the spiral chutes
onto the moving belts from which they are manhandled onto

the trucks Much noise and shouting

The front truck moves out to the city street As it does
CAMERA EMPHASIZES the big poster on its side The design
features a large pair of spectacles with heavy rims - a
trademark of Hunseckers (It will later be seen as the
masthead of the gossip column)

They eyes of Broadway

EXT BROADWAY - DUSK - NY

The truck starts on its journey along Broadway Some shots
are of the vehicle moving through very heavy traffic (taken
from a camera car) Others are from the inside of the
truck as it slows down the delivery man tosses the heavy
bundle of papers onto the sidewalk CAMERA following the
truck holds it in foreground against the blazing electric
signs of Broadway and Times Square

EXT BROADWAY - NIGHT
The southeast corner of the intersection of Broadway and
46th Street CAMERA fairly high shoots north towards the
impressive vista of electric signs silhouetted against the
darkening sky Very heavy traffic and crowded sidewalks
CAMERA descends towards the Orange Juice stand on the
corner passing the booth which sells souvenir hats It
moves through the congestion of chattering passersby
steadily approaching a smartly dressed young man who stands
at the counter of the Orange Juice stand Oblivious of the
hub-bub around him SIDNEY FALCO is concerned only with his
private problems

He turns sharply as a newspaper truck pulls up at the curb
behind him this is what he has been waiting for

CLOSER ANGLE - NIGHT

The news truck delivery man tosses a bundle out onto the
sidewalk besides a newsstand

DETAIL

The bundle of newspapers It hits the sidewalk with a smack
CAMERA PULLS BACK as Sidney Falco crosses the sidewalk The
owner of the newsstand IGGY comes to pick up the bundle

he is a grizzled gnome with a philosophical sense of humor
Sidney snaps his fingers with impatience Iggy wears
spectacles and is clearly more or less blind he has to
grope for the cord that binds the papers

IGGY
Aw Lady if I looked like you Id--

SIDNEY
CmonCmon

IGGY
(recognizing Sidneys voice)
Keep ya sweatshirt on Sidney

Majestically taking his time Iggy lifts the bundle to his
stand and cuts the cord

IGGY
Hey Fresh the Globe just came
in -- Hey Sidney want an item for

Hunseckers column Two rolls get
fresh with a baker Hey hot hot
hot -- etc

Annoyed Sidney throws him a dime seizes a paper and
returns briskly to the orange juice stand
ORANGE JUICE STAND - NIGHT

Sidneys place at the crowded counter has been taken by
newcomers Rudely he recovers his half-consumed glass of
orange juice and sandwich He takes them further down the
counter to a quieter corner at which he can examine the
paper CAMERA MOVING WITH HIM picks up further snatches of
overheard dialogue (See dialogue attached at the end of the
scene) We move close enough to see Sidneys hands open the
paper expertly at HUNSECKERS column - identifiable by the
picture of the spectacled eyes Over scene there is a
babble of offstage dialogue

CLOSE UP OF SIDNEY

His face is sullen as his eyes run rapidly down the column
He is reacting to a not unexpected disappointment

EXT SIDNEYS APARTMENT - BROADWAY - NIGHT

CAMERA SHOOTS WEST on 46th Street as Sidney comes down the

side street from the newsstand in background Irritably he
jerks open the door of a shabby entrance As the glass door
closes Sidney is seen striding up the stairs

FIRST FLOOR - OUTSIDE SIDNEYS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Beside the top of the stairs is the door to Sidneys office
On it there is a cheaply printed cardboard sign which reads

SIDNEY FALCO
Publicity

From inside comes the sound of desultory typing Sidney
comes up the stairs two at a time and turns into the door

INT SIDNEYS APARTMENT - NIGHT
SALLY is on the phone as Sidney strides in
SALLY
Just a minute Mr Weldon I

think

Sidney vigorously indicates that he doesnt want to take the
call

SALLY
(to phone)
Im sorry I thought that was Mr
Falco returning Yes Ill tell
him when he comes in I know hes
been trying to reach you

She hangs up

SALLY
Thats the third time hes called
today

SIDNEY

He wants me to break a leg

SALLY
(literally)
No an arm he said

(then)
I told him you were sure the item
would be in Mr Hunseckers column
in tomorrows

SIDNEY
(interrupting sharply)
It isnt Ive just seen the early

edition

SALLY
But

SIDNEY
But what

SALLY

That makes five days in a row that
Mr Hunseckers cut you out of his

column

SIDNEY
May I rent you out as an adding
machine

He has begun to change his clothes

SIDNEY
Get me Joe Robard

Sally goes back into the outer room

SIDNEY
Who else phoned
SALLY
The renting agent and the tailor

SIDNEY
Pay the rent Let the tailor wait

SALLY
It wont leave much of a balance in
the bank
(to phone)

Mr Robard Could you locate him

Sidney in a state of semi-undress comes to take the phone
from her

SIDNEY
(gloomily)
Watch me run a fifty yard dash with
my legs cut off

Very abruptly he comes alive on the phone A real laughing
boy

SIDNEY

(effusively)
Sidney Joe How do you like it
Im running out of alibis No I
asked Hunsecker to withhold the
item until he could give it a
fine fat paragraph The column
was running over and I didnt want
you kissed off with just a line

INT ROBARDS CLUB - NIGHT

Robard is a stolid secure man balding and with a moustache
He has a morose sense of humor He is speaking froma
telephone on a little desk at the end of the bar In
background the Club is open but there are few customers as
yet Some recorded jazz is being played while the musicians
are still arriving strolling past in background depositing
their overcoats and music cases in the little closet assigned
to them

ROBARD

(in answer to Sidney)
Of course

(he listens to

protest from Sidney)
What is this Sidney a kissing
game Youre a liar - thats a
publicity mans nature I wouldnt
hire you if you wasnt a liar I
pay you a C-and-a-half a week
wherein you plant big lies about me
and the Club all over the map

(a pause)
Yeah I mean in that sense But
also in the sense that you are a
personal liar too because you
dont do the work I pay you for

(new protests on the

other end of the line)
Oh stop it Sidney Youre from
the country not me

RESUME SIDNEY

Sally is watching him unhappy on his behalf

SIDNEY
(to phone)
Now wait a minute Joe When I
saw JJ last night he said

But Robard has cut off Sidney hangs up A silence Sally
tries to be comforting

SALLY
I wish I could help in some way
Sidney
SIDNEY
(aggressively)

Help me with two minutes of silence
Sally hurt says nothing Presently he adds

SIDNEY
Go home Sally Its late

SALLY
I hate to see you like this --

Sidney with another mercurial change of manner begins some
sarcastic clowning

SIDNEY
(horsing around)
Yes but as a new subscriber youre
under no obligation to take more
than three books And if you mail
the enclosed card within ten days --
SALLY
(pleadingly)
Sidney I know you by now Dont
do a dance with me

SIDNEY
(still clowning)
You mean you dont want the extra
free gift of a colorful giant map
of the world

SALLY
(distressed)
Sidney please dear if you feel
nervous

Sidney is abruptly savage

SIDNEY
(with cruelty)
So whatll you do if I feel nervous
Youll open your meaty sympathetic
arms

SALLY
(breaking down)
Sidyou got me soI dont know
what

She is crying Sidney feels uncomfortable Not too
generously he relents

SIDNEY
You ought to be used to me by now

SALLY
(pathetically)
Im used to you

SIDNEY

(with a touch of bitterness)
No You think Im a hero Im no
hero Im nice to people where it
pays me to be I gotta do it too
much on the outside so dont
expect me to kow-tow in my own
office Im in a bind right now
with Hunsecker so --

(grimly)
Every dog has his day

(going)
Lock up and leave the key

The phone rings Sidney is dressed by now As Sally goes
for it he makes for the outer door

SIDNEY
If thats for me tear it up

SALLY
Take a top coat

SIDNEY
And leave a tip in every hat-check
room in town

He is already gone as she picks up the phone

SALLY
Sidney Falco office Oh Miss
Kay he tried to reach you No
hes at the barbers now No
thats held over till the Tuesday
column

LAP DISSOLVE TO
INT ELYSIAN ROOM - NIGHT

The quintet As the dissolve clears a clatter of polite
applause greets the end of a previous number CAMERA is on
the bandstand moving smoothly through the group of five
musicians as the rhythm of a new number is set up first the
leader (a guitarist) snaps his fingers giving the tempo
tothe bass who walks with the beat bringing inthe
drums which start a quiet insistent wire-brush background
forthe cello and the flute whose introductory phrases
set the stage for

STEVE DALLAS

the guitar the leader again It comes in after this
short preamble with the first statement of melody (The tune
has a faint echo of significance because it is one of the
themes of the film already heard as a phrase in the
background score of the title music) CAMERA lingers a
moment on the guitarist STEVE DALLAS He is a youth of
pleasant intelligent appearance He plays with the intent
air of the contemporary jazz musician who takes his work
very seriously indeed and affects a much greater interest in
the music and his fellow musicians than in the listening
audience

SIDNEY
A close shot Sidney has just entered the club strolling
into the vestibule near the entrance He wears an expression
of oddly unsuitable antagonism as he looks forward

DALLAS

Seen in long shot from Sidneys viewpoint CAMERA moves to
include Sidney in foreground again He turns as he is
accosted by RITA the cigarette girl of the club She is a
pert creature attractive and not unaware of the fact

RITA
Dont you ever get messages
Eyelashes I called you twice

SIDNEY

(irked)
Ive been up to here Listen
honey tell me something You know
Susan Hunsecker

(Rita nods)
Has she been in I mean lately in
the last coupla days

RITA
I dont think so

SIDNEY
Youre sure Find out for me

RITA
(with a nod)
Sidney can I talk to you a minute

Rita wears an injured air Sidney preoccupied with other
worries callously ignores it

SIDNEY
Is Frank DAngelo around

RITA
At the bar - Sidney

But Sidney has moved away from her
DANGELO

He is at the bar listening with satisfaction to the music
watching the performers and studying the audience Sidney
comes up behind him We see Sidneys eyes flick from

DAngelo towards the bandstand and back again Then as he
takes the stool next to DAngelo he assumes a different
manner a sulky resentment DAngelo sees Sidney

D ANGELO
(to the bartender)
Joe give my nephew a drink

SIDNEY
(sullen)
Your nephew doesnt want a drink

DAngelo is still watching the quintet The guitar can be
heard again

ANOTHER ANGLE
Shooting past DAngelo and Sidney towards the bandstand

D ANGELO
Thats a lollipop that boy The
kid is only great

SIDNEY
And with ten percent of his future
youre great too Frank

DAngelo looks quickly at Sidney sensing the undercurrent
Then he turns his back on the musicians remarking ina

quiet tone

DANGELO
Went over to Philly yesterday an
seen the folksits nice you send

them the fifty a month

SIDNEY
(after a pause)
See my mother

DANGELO
(shaking his head)
I only had a few hours

A glum moment Frank sips his highball Sidney lights a
cigarette animosity on his face

D ANGELO
Thanks for the publicity spread you
got the boys for the benefit
tomorrow

SIDNEY
(begrudgingly)
Robards my client I did it for
him and his club not your boys

Frank again notes Sidneys resentful manner Sidney looks
towards the musicians

SIDNEY
(quietly)
Frank I think maybe you lied to me

DANGELO
(quietly)
Looka Sidney youre my own
sisters son but where does that
give you the right to call me a liar

SIDNEY
(looking towards Steve)
You told me that your boy was
washed up with Susie Hunsecker
didnt you

DANGELO
Yeah and its the truth to the
best of my knowledge And frankly
Im glad For Steves sake Im
glad not yours I manage these
boys and I got their best interests
at heart Steve shouldnt get
mixed up with no bimbo at his age

SIDNEY
(narrowly)
You told him that

DANGELO
Not in those exact words - you know
what a temper hes got

A pause Sidney is thinking

SIDNEY
When do these hot-headed boys of
yours go on the road

DANGELO
Coupla weeks For eight weeks

SIDNEY
Thats a nice tour All booked
(Frank nodding)
When was Susie around here last

DANGELO
Four five nights ago Thats how I
know the romance is off Also
Steves in a very bad mood

SIDNEY
(abruptly)
Listen Frank youd better make
sure youre telling me the truth

D ANGELO
(annoyed)
I dont like this threatening
attitude When it comes to it
what the heck is it your business
what they do this boy and girl

RITA

Locating Sidney she comes up behind him He turns away
from DAngelo as she whispers to him As she departs
Sidney turns back

SIDNEY
If you knew Hunsecker as well as I
did you might understand why its
my business Maybe youre walking
around blind Frank without a cane

Sidney gets off his stool Casually but to effect he adds

SIDNEY
and in case you didnt know it
Susie Hunseckers out there on the
back step right now

He turns away glancing towards Steve on the bandstand
behind him

DANGELO

He looks disturbed

INTEXT BACKSTAGE AND COURTYARD

From DAngelos point of view CAMERA LOOKS UP at Steve
The Quintet is now reaching the end of the number a driving
rhythm of considerable excitement A waiter passes in fg

and the CAMERA CRANES BACK through the curtained doorway to
the backstage part of the club This movement is continued
as we see some other employees including Jerry Wiggins the
intermission pianist who is waiting in the corridor near
the fire-exit As he steps out of the door to discard a
cigarette CAMERA AGAIN CONTINUES ITS MOVEMENT CRANING BACK
AND DOWNWARD into the little courtyard Here it discovers
the figure of a young woman who is waiting in the shadow
near the steps of the fire-escape listening to the music

CLOSER ANGLE

This is SUSAN HUNSECKER She wears an expensive mink coat
It is oddly in contrast with her personality the face is
sensitive and intelligent but childlike and tragic A girl
in adolescence already burdened with problems beyond her
capacity Over scene the music continues Susan shifts
her position knowing that the session will soon be at an
end and that the musicians will be coming backstage

INT ELYSIAN ROOM

Steve is playing the last bars of the number the whole
group now in unison

QUINTET

The music comes sharply dramatically to its finish There
is some applause The boys relax Steve reaches for the
microphone and in the characteristically casual manner of

the cool musician announces the end of the set thanking
the audience identifying the quintet by name and introducing
the intermission pianist During this Carson Chico and
Paul wander off the bandstand behind him

EXT BACKSTAGE AND COURTYARD

Chico Paul and Carson come through to the corridor backstage
As they do so Chico glancing out of the open door sees

Susan in the courtyard He goes out onto the fire-escape
Paul following behind

CHICO
Hi Susie

SUSAN
Hello Chico Paul

CHICO
(to Paul)
Throw a rope round this chick while
I go get Steve

Chico goes swiftly back into the club Paul remains with
Susan There is a momentary silence Paul is embarrassed
because Susan is Susan makes an effort at conversation
she nods towards the club

SUSAN
Full house

PAUL
Packin em in

INT CLUB

Steve has been trapped by a young woman in spectacles a
much-too-earnest devotee of progressive jazz

DEVOTEE
Im terribly interested in jazz --
serious jazz You studied with
Milhaud didnt you This is such
an interesting fusion of the
traditional classical form with
the new progressive style I just
wanted to ask you how you came to
form the group-

CHICO

He comes through the curtains of the doorway pausing as he
sees that Steve is involved with the Intellectual Young Woman

REVERSE ANGLE

Steve glancing at Chico over the shoulder of the Intellectual
Young Woman Seeing that Chico has something to say to him

he wriggles out of the young womans clutches by passing the

buck to the unfortunate to Fred Katz who is descending from

the bandstand behind him

STEVE
Well we just sort of got together
(turning to introduce Fred)
Maybe if you ask Mr KatzHe
writes the stuff you know

FRED
(blankly)
Huh

RESUME CHICO

Steve joins Chico and they go through the curtains into the
corridor outside
CORRIDOR
Chico smiling explains

CHICO
Dont waste your time there man
Youve got something better waiting
outside
(as Steve looks at him)
Susies out there

STEVE

His reaction betrays some emotion (Over scene the
intermission pianist has begun to play a Blues number)
Steve moves a quick step towards the door to the courtyard
then hesitates - almost as if he was afraid to go out He
meets Chicos eye again

STEVE
What did she say

CHICO
He is amused but sympathetic
CHICO
You proposed to her not me
(slapping him on the back)
Go get your answer

COURTYARD

Susan waiting at the foot of the iron steps turns as Steve
comes out on the fire escape above Steve comes quickly
down the steps towards her slowing down when he gets a few
paces away from her

SUSAN

She looks up at Steve

STEVE

A CLOSE SHOT In his expression we read his mute inquiry

RESUME SUSAN

Quite deliberately with her eyes moistened by love and
affectionshe nods
REVERSE ANGLE

Great relief and happiness can be seen in the boys face
After a moment he moves to her and she to him They
embrace swiftly hold each other close and then kiss with
passion Presently when the kiss is over Susan speaks
softly

SUSAN
(in a whisper)
SteveIllIll try to make a
good wife

Steve is still too choked with relief to speak For answer
he clasps her more tightly to him The beam of light which
falls on the iron stairs behind them narrows and then is
extinguished

CORRIDOR

Paul has closed the door Turning he shares a look with
the grinning Chico and Fred Katz who has managed to escape
from the young woman Before there is time for either of
them to make a remark Sidney comes through the curtains
from the Club

SIDNEY
Hi Fellows Wheres the Chief

Sidneys manner is very friendly But it is immediately
apparent from the reaction of the other three boys that none
of them likes Sidney Fred is deliberately uncomprehending

FRED
Who
SIDNEY
(who gets the point)
Dallas Is he around

Chicos back is to the closed door which opens onto the
courtyard Chico nods in the opposite direction towards the
stairs

CHICO
(unhelpfully)
Yeah hes around somewhere
Upstairs maybe

SIDNEY
(coldly as he goes)
Thanks
COURTYARD

Steve and Susan are still embracing Steve is exultantly
proud and happy

STEVE
(incoherent)
This is big you know Very big
Lets go out later drink some
firewater With the boys Fred
can call Millie and -

SUSAN
Steve Id rather you didnt say
anything for a day or twountil I
tell my brother

STEVE
His sobering reaction shows this is something important

STEVE
(gently)
You havent told him yet

SUSAN

SUSAN
Im telling him in the morning
after breakfast

STEVE AND SUSAN

Turning her head she makes a little gesture an unconscious
movement putting her fingers to her brow as if feeling a
headache

STEVE
He isnt going to like it

Susan says nothing She looks to Steve smiling but the
smile is not too confident

STEVE
You sure you dont want me to be
with you

Susan stoutly shakes her head Defensively she reassures
Steve

SUSAN
Steve my brother isnt as bad as
hes painted He isnt perfect
but -

STEVE
But he isnt going to like this
Susie And he makes you nervous
not me No I take that back - he
makes me nervous too But I
wouldnt give him a second thought
if not for you

The topic evidently makes Susan uneasy In an effort to
dismiss something that she does not want to think about
Susan puts her arms around Steves neck again

SUSAN
Lets forget him and -

But Steve is not so ready to change the subject

STEVE
His stooge Falco is around - I
saw him walk in

(soberly)
Hes been spying on me for weeks
Susie
SUSAN

(quickly perhaps too quickly)
Darling I dont care - really I
dont Sidneyd had a secret crush
on me for years but nothing we do
is his business -

STEVE
(gently insisting)
But he could be reporting back to
your brother couldnt he

SUSAN
(pleading)
Steve dear please forget all of
this What can it matter after

tomorrow
Now Steve responds He grins holds her closer
STEVE
(softly)

I have a message for you I love
you
(kissing her lightly)
May I dedicate the next number to
youAnd the next and the next
Every Sunday Ill buy you a new

bonnet —-

SUSAN

(amused but moved)

If the stores are open -

STEVE

And on Monday Ill take it off and
stroke your light brown hair and -

SUSAN

And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer

STEVE

(abruptly grinning)
How do you think I realized I love

you

SUSAN

I made you write a beautiful song

STEVE

No you had me eating that Chinese

food

They laugh and enjoyably but then

as the CAMERA MOVES

we

realize that Sidney is there on the fire escape above them

his manner is affable

SIDNEY

Can more than two enjoy this joke

(to Susan)

Hello Susie I didnt expect to

find you here

Steve says nothing But he obviously resents the intrusion
and finds it difficult to conceal the fact Sidney comes

down the fire escape towards them

SIDNEY

Wheres those glossy prints you
promised Tonights the latest I

can place them -

STEVE
(barely polite)

Well thanks anyway - lets forget

it
(to Susan)
Its cold out here Susie

Steve makes a move to lead Susan back inside It isa
gesture which appears to dismiss Sidney Sidney chooses to
take umbrage

SIDNEY
(lightly sarcastic)
Let me apologize for getting you
that press spread Its been an
honor to serve you gratis

Steve turns to Sidney his manner is quiet but challenging

STEVE
(levelly)
I get the feeling Falco that
youre always snooping around

SUSAN
(quickly intervening)
Steve stop it please

ANOTHER ANGLE

Frank DAngelo has followed Sidney out onto the fire escape
other members of the Quintet have also appeared

D ANGELO
What are you boys fighting about

Aggressively indignant Sidney throws up his hands he
knocks on the metal of the fire escape

SIDNEY
(sarcastic)
Kill me Find me a door somewhere -
I walked in without knocking

Sidney is trying to needle Steve Steves temper would
normally have exploded but now he controls it

STEVE
Im feeling too good to fight with
you but that isnt what I said - I
said you snoop For instance what
were you doing around my hotel the
other night

SIDNEY
(needling)
Begging your pardon I havent been
down the bowery in years

D ANGELO
(soothingly)
Come on boys break it up

STEVE
(overriding DAngelo)
The next time you want information
Falco dont scratch for it like a
dog - ask for it like a man

SIDNEY

His face tightens he appears to be mortally insulted and
controlling himself with difficulty He turns his back
swiftly on Steve addressing Susan in a voice that has a
sharp edge

SIDNEY
If youre going home Susie Ill
drop you off

Sidney starts quickly up the fire escape This makes Steve
angry and he steps forward to follow him But Chico
contrives without seeming to interfere to obstruct Steve

CHICO
(easily)
Time for the next set Chief

STEVE
Just a minute Chico

CORRIDOR

Sidney comes inside When he is out of sight or the group
in the courtyard his manner swiftly changes Its obvious
now that his indignation was assumed now he looks back
towards the courtyard and there is shrewdness in his eyes
he is assessing Steves temper But presently seeing
DAngelo and the boys returning he moves back to the
curtains into the Club

COURTYARD

As DAngelo and the other boys go inside Steve turns back
to Susan

STEVE
(fondly)
Just so you dont leave me ina
minor key
INT CLUB

Rita has succeeded in recapturing Sidney near the entrance
to the club Sidney alert and interested listens to her
while keeping his eye on the bandstand in bg where the
intermission pianist is finishing his performance and the
quintet are returning ready to mount the bandstand again

SIDNEY
Dont tell me you started a polka
with Leo Bartha

RITA
(shaking her head)
No Thats what I mean - Im being
fired for what I didnt do

Sidney is amused Rita continues in a confidential manner
which is heavily loaded with sex appeal and not-very-
convincing air of injury

RITA

(soto voce)
He came in last week on a very dull
rainy night I know who he was
but I didnt let on

(emphatically)
He didnt take his eyes off me all
night Listening

Rita has mistaken Sidneys shrewdly calculating expression
for inattention

SIDNEY
Avidly He was staring

RITA
(continuing)
Staring Consequently when he
approached me on his way out I
wasnt surprised but I didnt let
on

SIDNEY
(prompting)
He was writing a special Sunday
piece on

RITA
(nodding)
Ccigarette girls And naturally -

SIDNEY
You were thrilled to be interviewed
(she nods)
Were you interviewed

RITA
In his apartment -

SIDNEY
And where was his wife

RITA
I dont know - its a big apartment
But I wasnt interviewed In fact
I was totally unprepared for what
happened

SIDNEY
(grimacing)

Were old friends Chickie - quit
it A big columnist comes in this
room without his ball-and-chain
and you make like a delicatessen
counter What did you think would
happen in his house

RITA
(with a nod)
But Sidney darling the man must
be out of his mind - it was only
eleven oclock in the morning

Despite himself Sidney chuckles but she is distressed

RITA
For a moment I was so taken aback
that I said anything that popped
into my sleepy head If Im not
mistaken I even ordered the man
out of his own house

Sidneys eyes have been caught by something at the other end
of the big room

STEVE AND SUSAN
From Sidneys viewpoint Susan has come back into the club

with Steve and seems to be taking leave of him She starts
to walk through the club on her way out
RESUME SIDNEY AND RITA

Sidney with half his attention on Susan and Steve listens
to Ritas rueful protest

RITA

(rapidly)
He was furious and by the time I
could have put on a Tropical Island
mood I was out on the street

(dolefully)
That night Mr Van Cleve calls me
into his office here Hes got
nothing against me he says but he
cant afford to antagonize
columnists I told him I still
have Sonny at military academy but
Van Cleves made of ice

Aware that Sidney is moving to leave her so that he can
catch Susan Rita detains him with an appeal

RITA
(tentative)
Do you think you could do something
Sidney
SIDNEY

(a quick nod)
Thats what Im thinking Rita
Maybe

Rita is anxious to cement the offer Delicately she asks

RITA
Do you still keep your key under
the mat

SIDNEY

(eyeing her)
Can you be there by two-thirty

She drops her eyes nods Sidney pats her arm and is gone
She looks after him

SIDNEY AND SUSAN

Sidney overtakes Susan at the front entrance in time to open
the door for her He has now reverted to another mood in
which he appears to be sulking over the insult delivered to
him by Steve He goes out ahead of her
BANDSTAND

The quintet are resuming their positions on the stand
Steve lingers a moment his guitar already in his hand while
he talks to DAngelo

STEVE
Frank I dont want any secrets
from you I proposed to Susie
tonight

DAngelo hides his feelings asks

D ANGELO
Did she accept

STEVE
You dont like it do you I think
she will accept but Im not sure
She may be too dependent on her
brother

He mounts the bandstand

D ANGELO
(solemnly)
Lots of good people in this town
are dependent on her brother

Steve sits on the stool quietly gives the beat to his group
and begins at once the guitar opening of a very simple and
lonely melody (The Sage)

ANOTHER ANGLE

While DAngelo watches him the boy continues CAMERA
tracks slowly back through the club as the chatter and
babble of the customers begins to diminish in appreciation
of the quiet melancholy of the music

OUTSIDE THE ELYSIAN ROOM

Susan is standing beside the poster which features Steve
listening to the music from inside the club Sidney comes
to join her He is now pretending to be hurt

SUSAN
Youre touchy Sidney - dont be so
touchy

SIDNEY

(gruffly)
I wasnt looking for a brawl I

came to bring him a present
(then)

Wanna bite to eat

Susan shakes her head She looks up as she hears the
doormans whistle off screen Sidney moves forward to
escort her to the taxi

LONGER SHOT

They cross the sidewalk and get into the cab It starts off
and CAMERA PANS with it

INSIDE CAB

Susan is relaxed content but thoughtful Sidney flicks her
a quick anxious look Finally gloomily

SIDNEY
Feels like a Monday night dont
it
SUSAN
(softly)
Not to me Sometimes the world

feels like a cage Then someone

comes along and opens the doorand

its never Monday night again
(turning to Sidney)

I wish you and Steve could like

each other

SIDNEY
(grimacing)

We stick in each others craw

SUSAN
Yes but why

SIDNEY
Well for one thing he thinks JJ
is some kind of monster

SUSAN
Quizzically she studies Sidney

SUSAN
Dont you

SIDNEY
He looks up sharply (he is momentarily startled at Susans
insight) Swiftly he assumes a protesting air

SIDNEY
Susie your brothers one of my
best friends and -

RESUME SUSAN

She is not totally convinced by this performance She
smiles skeptically

SUSAN
I know But someday Id like to
look into your clever mind and see
what you REALLY think of him -

RESUME SIDNEY AND SUSAN

Sidney makes a show of indignation

SIDNEY
Where do you come off to make a
remark like that

SUSAN
(quietly)
Who could love a man who keeps
jumping through burning hoops like
a trained poodle

Sidney doesnt immediately answer Susan drops her eyes
becoming absorbed in her own problems Cautiously Sidney
lets the momentary silence continue Then

SUSAN
(thoughtfully)
Do you think JJ likes Steve

SIDNEY
(glibly)
Frankly yes to my surprise He
thinks hes very gifted - those
boysll go a big mile he thinks

Susan says nothing Sidney watching her closely probes
further

SIDNEY
(gently)
You feel pretty strong about this
boy

A pause Then Susan nods She is not looking at Sidney and
cannot see the watchfulness in his face Sidney prompts
again

SIDNEY

Wedding bells you mean
Again Susan nods

SUSAN
He wants me to go on the road with
them Its an eight month tour
all the way to Oregon

SIDNEY

The news has considerable impact on him But he hides it
saying lightly

SIDNEY
Well congratulations But dont
go just for the ride Or didnt
you accept the proposal

RESUME SUSAN AND SIDNEY
Susan continues

SUSAN
Im going to discuss it with JJ
in the morning

A pause Each is concerned with private thoughts Susan
relaxed adds quietly

SUSAN
(softly)
Its given me a big lift to know
that some people want me for
myself not just because Im my
brothers sister

SIDNEY
Chickie Ill have to laugh at
that - an attractive girl like
you

Susan ignores his remark continuing thoughtfully

SUSAN
I hope that JJ really likes
Steve that it isnt an act

SIDNEY
(with an indignant edge)
Why should he put on an act Your
brother has told PRESIDENTS where
to go and what to do

The taxi has pulled to a stop Susan sits for a moment
before she remarks

SUSAN
The act would be for my sake not
Steves

Realizing that they have come to their destination Susan
gets up moving out of CAMERA as she disembarks from the
taxi CAMERA catches a glimpse of apprehension in Sidneys
eyes Quickly he decides to follow her

EXT BROADWAY

Susan getting out of the taxi moves past CAMERA Sidney
following her instructs the driver

SIDNEY
(to cabbie)
Wait for me Ill be right back

LONGER SHOT
Sidney moves after the girl calling Susie
SUSAN

Hearing him Susan turns back Sidney walks into shot to
join her

SIDNEY
(lightly)
Its not my nature Susie but Ill
talk to you like an uncle

SUSAN
(smiling)
But I dont need an uncle Sidney

They move through the doors

REVERSE ANGLE
Sidney quickly corrects himself saying earnestly

SIDNEY

No I mean because I admire you -
in fact more than admire you -
although thats neither here nor
there

(quickly skipping to

the important point)
Susie dont sell your brother
short Talk this over with him I
mean - youll find him a real friend

SUSAN

Susan looks thoughtful making no comment
RESUME SIDNEY AND SUSAN

Carefully (again probing) he prompts her

SIDNEY
Any message in case I see JJ
later

Susan turns away and walks out past CAMERA Sidney watches
her

SUSAN
She looks back at Sidney quietly firm

SUSAN
Yes Tell him for me that Steve
Dallas is the first real man Ive
ever been in love with

She turns away and walks through the inner door going down
the corridor towards the elevators in background

RESUME SIDNEY

The sincerity of the girls manner strikes home to Sidney
Now that her back is turned we see the sharp twinge of pain
with which he hears the statement of her feelings for
another man Angered he wheels striding out of the door
onto Broadway

EXT BROADWAY

Sidney returns to the cab instructing the driver
SIDNEY
The Twenty One Club

He climbs in and the taxi drives off down Broadway
LAP DISSOLVE TO
EXT TWENTY ONE CLUB - NIGHT

CAMERA HIGH SHOOTING WEST down 52nd Street as Sidneys cab
pulls up double parking in front of the 21 Club Sidney
maneuvers his way between the parked cars towards the
entrance and the CAMERA DESCENDS to SHOOT ALONG the courtyard
towards the entrance We see the figure of Jimmy Weldon and
his girl friend coming out of the Club

CLOSER ANGLE - NIGHT

Jimmy Weldon is coming out of the Club accompanied by a

girl he is slightly tight As he steps through the outer
doors Weldon again spies Sidney on the sidewalk he steps
to one side of the entrance way

Sidney slips through the congestion but just as he tries to
enter the Club Weldons hand shoots out neatly ambushing
him pulling him aside into the narrow courtyard Sidney is
instantly resentful of this manhandling but has to adjust
himself assuming a quick smile for the benefit of Weldon

SIDNEY
Jimmy This is a coincidence I
am just going -

WELDON
(overlapping)
Yeah A coincidence you should run
into the very man youve been
ducking all week
(to the girl)
This is my press agent Joan

Weldon jibing at Sidney plays his remarks off the girl
who is amused Sidney of course is not

SIDNEY
(quickly)
I tried to reach you twice -

WELDON
(overlapping)
What do you do for that hundred a
week Fall out of bed
SIDNEY
Jimmy Im on my way inside right
now to talk to Hunsecker I can
promise you -

WELDON
(horsing)
Joan call a cop Well arrest
this kid for larceny

Sidney flinches his pride touched

SIDNEY
Listen when your band was playing
at Roseland -

WELDON
(cutting in)
That was two months ago Take your
hand out of my pocket thief

The girl tries to quiet Weldon who has gone from horsing to
loud contempt

THE GIRL
Take it easy Jimmy dear

WELDON
(indignantly)
Why Its a dirty job but I pay
clean money for it dont I

Abruptly Sidney bursts out giving as good as he has taken

SIDNEY
No more you dont What is this -
Youre showing off for her Theyre
supposed to hear you in Korea

WELDON
(smirking to the girl)
Hes intuitive - he knows hes
getting fired

SIDNEY
If youre funny James Ima
pretzel Drop dead

Weldon shepherded by the girl is already on his way across
the sidewalk
WELDON
It was nice knowing you Sidney
Not cheap - but nice Happy
unemployment insurance

INT TWENTY ONE CLUB - NIGHT

Sidney entering the Club threads his way through the
crowded foyer coming up to CAMERA near the foot of the
staircase There he meets a Captain who turns to him

CAPTAIN
How are you tonight Mr Falco

SIDNEY
(nodding towards the restaurant)
Is he inside

CAPTAIN
But of course

SIDNEY
Alone or surrounded

CAPTAIN
A Senator an Agent and Something -
With - Long - Red - Hair

Sidney moves past CAMERA coming a couple of paces towards
the door to the restaurant He pauses

REVERSE ANGLE

From Sidneys viewpoint Shooting through the doorway into
the restaurant we can see the group at the table
(Hunseckers back is turned to us) CAMERA PULLS BACK to
include Sidney in foreground He decides not to go into
restaurant and turns away out of shot

INT LOUNGE

Sidney comes round the corner from the foyer and walks
through the lounge to the door into the alcove where the
phone booths are CAMERA PANNING

PHONE BOOTHS

Sidney moves briskly past the girl at the switchboard
instructing her

SIDNEY
Honey get me Mr Hunsecker
The girl reaches for a book of phone numbers then remembers

OPERATOR
Hes right inside Mr Falco

SIDNEY
(from inside the booth)
So it isnt Long Distance

As the girl shrugging puts through the call CAMERA moves
closer to Sidney in the booth He hears the connection
made speaks at once

SIDNEY
(to phone)
JJ3 Its me --

We are close enough to the instrument to hear the sound of a
voice on the other end Though the words are not
distinguishable it is quite clear that the speaker is not
talking to the phone Sidney seems to relax as if this is
something that happens often He waits studying his
manicured fingertips

Presently Sidney hears the voice on the other end become
clearer It asks Yes CAMERA moves closer as Sidney says

SIDNEY
J3 its Sidney Can you come
outside for one minute

Hunseckers voice filtered through the sound of the
telephone is sharp and tiny but the words are now very
clear

HUNSECKER (0S)
Can I come out No

SIDNEY
(tensely)
I have to talk to you alone JJ
thats why

HUNSECKER (0S)
You had something to do for me -
you didnt do it

SIDNEY
Can I come in for a minute

HUNSECKER (0S)
No Youre dead son - get yourself
buried

There is a click as Hunsecker hangs up Sidney more
slowly also hangs up Brooding he comes out of the booth

INT TWENTY ONE CLUB - LOUNGE

Sidney comes out of the door to the phone booths walks
through the lounge to the hallway He turns towards the
dining room

INT HALLWAY

Sidney comes to the door into the dining room CAMERA
tracking with him Here he pauses looking towards

HUNSECKER

From Sidneys viewpoint Hunsecker is seated at a table
which is cleverly his habitual position We see him only in
semi-back view a broad and powerful back He is listening
to a man who has paused at his table stooping over Hunsecker
to whisper in his ear As the columnist listens his hands
play with an omni-present pad and pencil which lie on the
dinner table amongst an assortment of envelopes mimeographed
sheets and a telephone Beyond Hunsecker and the man

talking to him are the SENATOR the AGENT and an attractive
if fatuous GIRL

HUNSECKER
Ill check it in the morning Low -
thanks

The man leaves Hunsecker is scribbling a note on the pad
Meanwhile the Senator whispers something to the girl who
giggles softly

REVERSE ANGLE

Sidney comes across to the table nervous but deliberate
CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Hunsecker in foreground
Sidney without accosting him stands a few feet from the
columnists elbow and deliberately lights a cigarette
Hunsecker barely turning his head sees him We have heard
of Hunsecker as a monster but he is evidently in a mild
phase of his metabolism for he seems gentle sad and quiet
as he turns his gaze casually to the Senator totally
ignoring the young man who stands behind him

HUNSECKER
(softly)
Harvey I often wish I were dead
and wore a hearing aidwith a
simple flick of a switch I could
shut out the greedy murmur of
little men

SIDNEY

A close shot Sidney shows no reaction to this insult He
steps in closer an Indian fixity in his face

SIDNEY
JJ I need your ear for two
minutes

REVERSE ANGLE

Shooting across Sidney onto Hunsecker JJ turns - but

not to Sidney He raises his hand in a small gesture which
summons a passing Captain who steps into picture at Sidneys
elbow

HUNSECKER
Mac I dont want this man at my
table

SIDNEY

(quickly but quietly interrupting)
I have a message from your sister

The Captain is already there But now Hunseckers eyes have
switched to Sidneys face For the briefest of moments
nothing happens Then Hunsecker seeming to relax and
ignoring the Captain whom he has summoned turns back to
casual conversation with the Senator as if nothing had
happened

HUNSECKER
Forgive me Harvey We were
interrupted before -

In foreground Sidney turns to the Captain with a carved
smile indicating that Hunseckers change of topic is to be
interpreted as sanction for Sidney to remain The Captain
not entirely convinced retreats Sidney finds himself a
chair places it and takes a seat which is near enough to
the table to establish his presence During this

SENATOR
(who is mildly
surprised and faintly embarrassed)
Errthe Supreme Court story I
was telling you - Justice Black

HUNSECKER
(nodding)
Yes the Justice thats right
But I think you had it in the column

SIDNEY
(smoothly casually)
Last July the lead item

Sidneys interjection is quietly well-mannered Hunsecker
totally ignores it The other members of the party are a
little astonished at the interplay The girl in particular
is fascinated she clearly admires Sidneys looks The
Senator noting this glances at Sidney accepting the point

SENATOR
(laughing)
And I believe thats precisely
where I read it too You see
Jd where I get my reputation for
being the best-informed man in
Washington

HUNSECKER
Now dont kid a kidder

THE SENATOR THE GIRL AND THE AGENT

The girl looks again towards Sidney The Senator again sees
this addresses Sidney pleasantly

SENATOR
I dont think we caught your name
young man

REVERSE ANGLE

Group shot The Senator in foreground Sidney beyond
Hunsecker in background and the others on edge of shot

SIDNEY
Sidney Falco sir And of course
everyone knows and admires you
Senator Walker

SENATOR
(humorously)
Every four years I get less
convinced of that This young lady
is Miss Linda James
(indicates the Girl)
Shes managed by Manny Davis
(he indicates the Agent)

SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER
Sidney nods pleasantly to the Girl and the Agent

SIDNEY
I know Manny Davis

HUNSECKER
(quietly)
Everyone knows Manny Davis
(as the phone rings
on the table)
except MRS Manny Davis

Hunsecker is picking up the phone continuing

HUNSECKER
Yes Go ahead Billy - shoot

REVERSE ANGLE

To intercut with the above The Senator the Agent and the
Girl watching Hunsecker The Agents reaction to Hunseckers
remark is a sickly smile

RESUME HUNSECKER
He repeats aloud a story which is told him over the telephone

HUNSECKER
Uh huh Sports cars in California
are getting smaller and
smallerthe other day you were
crossing Hollywood Boulevard and
you were hit by oneyou had to go
to the hospital and have it
removed

(coolly)

Youre not following the column I
had it last week

During the speech CAMERA eases back to include Sidney again
At the end Sidney looks up in the direction of the Senator

SIDNEY
Do you believe in capital
punishment Senator
RESUME REVERSE ANGLE
The Senator amused asks

SENATOR
Why

RESUME HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY
Sidney glances sidelong at Hunsecker

SIDNEY
(pointing to the phone)
A man has just been sentenced to
death

Hunseckers face hardens aware of Sidneys impertinence he
does not design to react directly he turns towards the Agent

HUNSECKER
Manny what exactly are the UNSEEN
gifts of this lovely young thing
that you manage

THE AGENT AND THE GIRL
The Agent glances uneasily at the Girl beside him

AGENT
Well she sings a littleyou
know sings

GIRL
(by rote)
Mannys faith in me is simply awe-
inspiring Mr Hunsecker Actually
Im still studying but -

RESUME HUNSECKER
He studies the Girl intently

HUNSECKER
What subject

RESUME THE AGENT AND THE GIRL
GIRL

Singing of coursestraight
concert and -
RESUME HUNSECKER

Hunseckers glance flicks between the Girl and the Senator

HUNSECKER
Why of course It might for
instance be politics

As the Girl betrays herself with a nervous glance at the
Senator beside her CAMERA eases back to include him The
Senator is unruffled gravely he lights a cigar The Girl
laughs

GIRL
Me I mean I Are you kidding
Mr Hunsecker With my Jersey City
brains

RESUME HUNSECKER
Again his glance links the Girl and the Senator

HUNSECKER
The brains may be Jersey City but
the clothes are Trainor-Norell

THE SENATOR THE AGENT AND THE GIRL

The Girl and the Agent are both nervously uneasy The
Senator closely examines the tip of his cigar and with
deliberation turns towards Sidney

SENATOR
Are you an actor Mr Falco

GIRL
(supporting the
change of subject)
Thats what I was thinking Are
you Mr Falco

SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER

Hunsecker for the first time half-turns in Sidneys
direction amused

HUNSECKER
How did you guess it Miss James

RESUME THE AGENT THE GIRL AND THE SENATOR

They all look at Sidney
GIRL
Hes so pretty thats how

RESUME SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER

Sidney bitterly resents the adjective but contrives to hide
the fact he smiles gracefully accepting the compliment
Hunsecker (who knows what Sidney feels) is pleased he turns
towards Sidney expansively

HUNSECKER
Mr Falco let it be said at once
is aman of FORTY faces not one
none too pretty and ALL deceptive
See that grin Its the charming
street urchins face Its part of
his helpless act - he throws
himself on your mercy I skip the
pleading nervous bit that sometimes
blends over into bluster The
moist grateful eye is a favorite
face with him - it frequently ties
in with the act of boyish candor
hes talking straight from the
heart get it Hes got about
half-a-dozen faces for the ladies
but the real cut one to me is the
quick dependable chap - nothing he
wont do for you in a pinch At
least so he says Tonight Mr
Falco whom I did not invite to sit
at this table is about to show in
his last and most pitiful role
pale face with tongue hanging out
In brief gentlemen and Jersey
Lilly the boy sitting with us is a
hungry press agent and fully up to
all the tricks of his very slimy
trade

Hunsecker has started his speech lightly but it has built
up to enough cold contempt and feeling to embarrass and
intimidate the others at the table In conclusion
Hunsecker his eyes on Sidney picks up a cigarette and
waits expectantly

HUNSECKER
(quietly)
Match me Sidney

SIDNEY
(coolly)
Not just this minute JJ

Amused Hunsecker lights his own cigarette turns towards a
man who comes up to the table

HUNSECKER

A single close up to intercut with the above

SIDNEY

A matching single Sidneys reaction to Hunsecker and to the
others at the table

THE AGENT THE GIRL AND THE SENATOR

To intercut with the above their reactions of embarrassment

GROUP SHOT

A florid MAN comes up to the table obviously anxious to
catch Hunseckers attention Hunsecker in the act of
lighting his own cigarette scarcely looks at the man as he
dismisses him

HUNSECKER
I know - that loafer of yours opens
at the Latin Quarter next week
(more sharply)
Say goodbye Lester

The florid man retreats To cover the embarrassment the
Senator makes a sally in Sidneys direction

SENATOR
May I ask a naive question Mr
Falco Exactly how does a press
agent work

SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER
Sidney doesnt answer

HUNSECKER
Why dont you answer the man
Sidalee Hes trying to take you
off the hook

SIDNEY
(to the Senator)
You just had a good example of it
A press agent eats a columnists
dirt and is expected to call it
manna

RESUME THE AGENT THE GIRL AND THE SENATOR

GIRL
Whats manna

RESUME HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY
Hunsecker glances spitefully at the Girl

HUNSECKER
Heaven dust

RESUME THE AGENT THE GIRL AND THE SENATOR
The Senator continues to Sidney

SENATOR
But dont you help columnists by
furnishing them with items

RESUME SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER

Sidney leans forward indicating to the Senator some of the
items of paper that litter the table in front of Hunsecker
these are both handwritten notes and mimeograph sheets

scraps of assorted items from professional and amateur

agents who supply the columnist Sidney fingers some of them

SIDNEY
Sure columnists cant get along
without us Only our good and
great friend JJ forgets to
mention that We furnish him with
items -

Sidney lifts a mimeographed sheet as an example

HUNSECKER
What some cheap gruesome gags

SIDNEY
(to Hunsecker now)
You print them dont you

HUNSECKER
Yes with your clients names
attached Thats the only reason
those poor slobs pay you - to see
their names in my column all over
the world Now as I make it out
youre doing ME a favor

SIDNEY
I didnt say that JJ

HUNSECKER
The day that I cant get along
without press agents handouts
Ill close up shop lock stock and
barrel and move to Alaska

THE AGENT THE GIRL AND THE SENATOR
The Agent makes the mistake of trying to agree with Hunsecker

AGENT
(nodding)
Sweep out my igloo here I come

CAMERA pulls back as Hunsecker leans forward across the
table He vents upon the unfortunate Agent some of the
annoyance prompted by Sidneys impertinence

HUNSECKER
(to the Agent)
Look Manny you rode in here on
the Senators shirt tails so shut
your mouth

The Senator doesnt like this treatment of others and his
manner and face show it

SENATOR
(slowly)
Now come JJ thats a little
too harsh Anyone seems fair game
for you tonight

HUNSECKER
(not as harsh but -)

This man is not for you Harvey
and you shouldnt be seen with him
in public Because thats another
part of a press agents life - he
digs up scandal among prominent men
and shovels it thin among the
columnists who give him space

SENATOR
He finds Hunseckers manner disturbing but addresses him
frontally

SENATOR
There is some allusion here that
escapes me

HUNSECKER

HUNSECKER
(an edge of threat)
Were friends Harvey - we go as
far back as when you were a fresh
kid Congressman dont we

RESUME SENATOR

SENATOR
Why does everything you say sound
like a threat

RESUME HUNSECKER
He leans back speaking more quietly enjoying himself

HUNSECKER
Maybe its a mannerism - because I
dont threaten friends Harvey
But why furnish your enemies with
ammunition Youre a family man
Someday with God willing you may
wanna be President Now here you
are Harvey out in the open where
any hep person knows that this one

AGENT
Hunsecker leans into shot pointing directly at the Agent

HUNSECKER
(continuing)
is toting THAT one

Hunsecker points to the Girl and the CAMERA makes a slight
crab movement to include the Girl as Hunsecker points in
turn to her

HUNSECKER
(continuing)

around for you

Another CAMERA movement Now Hunsecker is directly
challenging the Senator
RESUME HUNSECKER
He smiles disarmingly

HUNSECKER
(continuing)
Are we kids or what

Hunsecker rises
GROUP SHOT

As Hunsecker stands up Sidney follows suit The Agent
very nervous gets to his feet and the Girl does likewise
The Senator whose face is sober also rises from the table

HUNSECKER

(to the Senator affably)

Next time you come up you might
join me at my TV show

With Sidney making way for him Hunsecker walks round the
end of the table to the Senator The Senator faces Hunsecker
solemnly

SENATOR
(quietly and cautiously)
Thank you JJ for what I consider
sound advice

Hunsecker matches the Senators solemnity

HUNSECKER
(deadpan)
Go Thou and sin no more

Hunsecker moves out of shot Sidney murmurs a pleased to
meet you to the Senator then he follows Hunsecker The
Senator remains looking after Hunsecker Behind him the
Agent and the Girl watch him apprehensively The Senator
his face now showing the traces of guilt which he did not
reveal to Hunsecker seems unwilling to turn back to face
them

ON THE WAY TO THE FOYER

Hunsecker and Sidney Hunsecker addresses the Captain on
his way out of the restaurant

HUNSECKER
Mac dont let the Senator pay that
check

CAPTAIN
Tll take care of it Mr Hunsecker

CAMERA tracks with Hunsecker and Sidney as they move out
towards the hat check stand

HUNSECKER
(murmuring)
President My big toe would make a
better President

By now they are at the coatroom Hunsecker smiling

ATTENDANT

HUNSECKER
Find me a good one Joe

He accepts the proferred coat as he moves past CAMERA
LONGER SHOT - NIGHT

The Doorman on the sidewalk has noticed Hunsecker almost
before the columnist has appeared The Doorman wheels
snapping his fingers and signaling towards the car park
attendant who can be seen at some distance in the background
under the lights of the Kinney Car Park The attendant is
seen to react with alacrity running into the Park

HUNSECKER

Putting on his overcoat he addresses another of the Captains
who has escorted him out of the Club

HUNSECKER
Dan anyone calls tell em Ill be
at the Morocco maybe the Embers

DAN
Very good Mr Hunsecker

Sidney catches up with Hunsecker as he moves out onto the
sidewalk

HUNSECKER
Wheres your coat Sidalee Saving
tips
Sidney thinks of an impertinent reply decides not to be
drawn and says nothing

HUNSECKER
(to Sidney)
My curiosity is killing me what
are you so rambunctious about
tonight

Sidney again does not answer this time he points across the
street

SIDNEY
Theres your fat friend

LONGER SHOT - POLICE CAR - NIGHT

The car is framed in foreground We can read the sign POLICE
attached to the visor Two men in plain-clothes detectives
are in the front seats The man nearest is HARRY KELLO
Wanting to look like a prosperous business man Kello looks
soft fat mild and well-barbered but he is dangerous he
knows it and enjoys it With big shots he is playful and
kidding always says just enough not too much He is very
relaxed and mild in manner but underneath there is not
only an animal energy but a feral pressing at you His
voice is on the hoarse side He measures situations
automatically and instantly

The police radio is chattering Also in evidence is the
telephone the radio link with headquarters The detective
at the wheel nudges Kello pointing across the street
Kello gets out of the car and moves to meet the columnist

HUNSECKER
(as he approaches)
Hello Harry

KELLO
(cheerfully)
Bonna sera commendatore Come sta

Sidney follows a couple of paces behind Hunsecker he is in
no hurry to meet the detective whom he clearly dislikes

HUNSECKER
(turning to Sidney)
You see Sidalee that shows that
Lt Kello likes your people

REVERSE ON KELLO
Kello offers his hand to Hunsecker

KELLO
Its my Brooklyn background JJ
Im good on Yiddish too

Hunsecker accepting the handshake winces with pretended
pain at what is clearly an over-enthusiastic grip

HUNSECKER
Harry am I supposed to say uncle

Kello laughs releases the grip Hunsecker strolls past him
stoops to lean into the car listening to the police calls on
the radio

HUNSECKER
Anything fit to print tonight
(to the policeman in
the car)
Hello Phil Howre the kids

The detective inside the car answers respectfully

PHIL

Hunsecker turns back to Kello and Sidney

ANOTHER ANGLE
Mischievously Hunsecker nods at Sidney

HUNSECKER
(to Kello)
Say hello to Sidney Falco Tickle

KELLO
(mildly)

Instantly aware that JJ is toying with Sidney Kello
offers his large hand to Sidney who refuses it

SIDNEY

cop in town

KELLO
(with a laugh)

cream face

HUNSECKER
(laughing)

The memory of something unpleasant clouds Kellos face

KELLO
Citizens committees I didnt mean
to hit the boy that hard Yeah

The policeman in the car sticks his head out of the window

PHIL
(to Hunsecker)
She died twenty minutes ago Mr
Hunsecker Theyre still
investigating

HUNSECKER
(shaking his head
with total dismissal)
Thats show business Thanks Phil
(to Kello)

HUNSECKER

CAMERA now SHOOTS down 52nd Street Hunsecker back to
CAMERA studies the evening hearing the sound of a screech
of female laughter from one of the groups in the distance

A drunk is being thrown out of one of the strip tease joints

HUNSECKER
I love this dirty town

Amused Hunsecker turns back he signals across the street
to the car park indicating that the big black Lincoln
Continental should follow as he strolls with Sidney

HUNSECKER SIDNEY FOLLOWING
HUNSECKER
(after a pause)
Conjugate me a verb Sidney For

CAMERA TRACKS with them in a CLOSE TWO SHOT Sidney is
alert now

HUNSECKER
(continuing)
You told me youd break up that
romance - when

SIDNEY
(hesitantly)
You want something done JJ but
I doubt if you yourself know whats
involved

HUNSECKER
(soft and sardonic)
Im a schoolboy - teach me teach me

SIDNEY
(carefully)
Why not break it up yourself You
could do it in two minutes flat

Hunsecker pauses halts

HUNSECKER

(harshly)
At this late date you need
explanations Susies all I
got - now that shes growing up I
want my relationship with her to
stay at least at par I dont
intend to antagonize her if I dont
have to

(starting to walk again)

HUNSECKER

Correct me if Im wrong

Sidney steps in front of Hunsecker blocking his way for a

moment

SIDNEY
(very rapidly)

About a year ago you asked me to
do a favor It was a thing - well

Hunsecker totally disinterested in Sidneys problems of

conscience signals to his car again
continues rapidly

SIDNEY

HUNSECKER
(sardonically)

Sidney quickly moves into JJs path desperate to hold his
attention

SIDNEY

pound Ill see it through but

HUNSECKER
(his mouth tight and mean)
What you promised - do it Dont

Hunsecker walks past Sidney now making for the car at which
the attendant still waits

SIDNEY
(as Hunsecker passes him)
Excuse it but its later than you

HUNSECKER

Hunsecker is HIT he stops in his stride he pauses and he
turns slowly to look at Sidney Lowering he hesitates
mind clicking

HUNSECKER

REVERSE ANGLE - FAVORING SIDNEY

Sidney his eyes bright nods Hunsecker studies Sidney
then

HUNSECKER
No wonder youve been so feisty
tonight
A pause
HUNSECKER
(quietly)

Can you deliver

Sidney nods

SIDNEY
Uh huh

HUNSECKER
When

SIDNEY

Tonight Before you go to bed
The cat is in the bag and the bag
is in the river

HUNSECKER

Expressionless he examines Sidney Then he walks off
toward the car He tips the attendant who thanks him but
instead of getting into the back of the car he makes a
small authoritative gesture to Nikko (double) to move over
so that Hunsecker himself may drive While Nikko does so
Hunsecker turns back to Sidney whom the CAMERA now includes

HUNSECKER
(quietly)
Dont be a two time loser Sidalee
The sentence could be severe

SIDNEY
He is satisfied
HUNSECKER

Hunsecker gets into the drivers seat beside Nikko the
Japanese houseboy CAMERA is CLOSE on Hunsecker who does
not look back but is clearly aware of the position of Sidney
as he puts the car into gear revving the engine

SIDNEY - NIGHT

The big car accelerates with impressive power In doing so
it sends a cloud of fumes and a swirl of dust in Sidneys
direction He leaps out of the way too late CAMERA MOVES
closer to him as with anger and ignominy he inspects his
precious clothing for damage But as he looks after the
car his face hardens into grim humor he senses that this
petty gesture from Hunsecker is an indication of his
vulnerability not his strength As dusting his coat
Sidney walks away CAMERA RISES watching his jaunty figure
cross the street in the direction of 51st Street

QUICK LAP DISSOLVE TO
INT TOOTS SHORS RESTAURANT

A LONG SHOT looking over the round bar towards the entrance

The Captain nods towards a booth on the other side of the
bar where Mrs Bartha is sitting alone Seeing that Bartha
is not with her the Captain looks around the bar

CAPTAIN
Hes somewhere

SIDNEY
(interrupting)
Thanks I see him

Sidney is looking back towards the entrance hall where

BARTHA

Bartha comes forward (from the Mens Room) passing the
Captain and Sidney Sidney moves to intercept him

SIDNEY
Hello Leo How goes that Sunday

ANOTHER ANGLE

A CLOSE SHOT on Bartha as he turns towards Sidney stopping

BARTHA
(cautiously)
Who told you about it

SIDNEY
Sidney smiles at Bartha but the threat is clear

SIDNEY
The cigarettes girlRita And
she took out all her hairpins too

RESUME BARTHA

He throws a quick glance at his wife in the booth in
background CAMERA PULLS BACK as Sidney who has noted the
look moves closer to Bartha

SIDNEY
I never had the pleasure of meeting
your wife You know what I wonder
Leo Could you use a hot little
item for tomorrows column

Sidney is pulling out of his pocket a pad on which to
scribble the item But Bartha faces him squarely speaking
sotto voce but with emphasis

BARTHA
What is this blackmail Beat it

Bartha turns on his heel and turns to walk towards his wife
beyond

SIDNEY

Sidneys face tightens After a pause he makes a decision
and walks towards the booth

BARTHA AND HIS WIFE

Barthas wife is reading a tabloid and sipping champagne
while her husband resumes eating a sandwich These two are
antagonists in a long war Sidney comes up to the table
repeats

SIDNEY
Leo Ive never had the pleasure of
meeting your wife
Bartha looks up What can he do Begrudgingly

BARTHA
LorettaSidney Falco

WIFE
(chatty)
How do you do Mr Falco If you
know anything about horses sit a
minute Help yourself to a glass
of this NY State champagne -

Mrs Bartha pushes the champagne bottle in Sidneys direction
as Sidney sits pleasantly Bartha concentrates on his
sandwich

SIDNEY
All the imported wines arent what
theyre cracked up to be

WIFE
Whose side are you on Mr Falco
his or mine

SIDNEY
Frankly Mrs Bartha Im a neutral
observer for the United Nations

WIFE

Mrs Bartha laughs enjoying his deftness then

WIFE

SIDNEY
(over scene)
Sidney

Mrs Bartha turns to concentrate on the names in the racing
column of the tabloid

WIFE
(searching the column)
No horse running tomorrow by that
name

BARTHA WIFE AND SIDNEY
An ANGLE favoring Bartha and Sidney Bartha glowers at his
wife resenting the fact that she has permitted Sidney to
join them

BARTHA
You ought to stop this nonsense
Loretta these two dollar bets

WIFE
(cheerfully)
Its compensation Leo for the
marginal life we lead

(to Sidney)
Sidney did you hear the story
about the cloak-and-suitor who --
BARTHA

(sharply interrupting)
Thats right Tell him so I can
read it in Hunseckers column first

(to Sidney brightly)
Oh are you a spy for the other side

SIDNEY
No I actually sat down to give Leo

WIFE
Leo he wants to give you an item -

Bartha notes Sidneys writing

BARTHA
(to his wife)
Will you mind your own business

WIFE

Hitler

She returns to her paper ignoring them Sidney finishes
scribbling the item

SIDNEY
Just in case youd like to print
it Leo Its a blind - no names
mentioned But for your private
information the guys name is
Dallas

He pushes the item to Bartha who reads it briefly
Meanwhile

WIFE
(concentrating on the tabloid)
There isnt a single name here that
gives off vibrations

Bartha pushes the item back towards Sidney Sidney glances
quickly at Barthas stony face then significantly turns
towards his wife

SIDNEY
Anything there with a name like
cigarette girl

Bartha raises his head looks squarely at Sidney with
contempt and anger His wife is unaware of this reaction

Still looking at the paper she murmurs

WIFE
MMmmmmcigarette girl No no
horse with a name like that

Sidney pushes the item back towards Bartha

WIFE

Mrs Barthas attention is attracted by Sidneys gesture
She looks up made aware of this strange by-play

BARTHA AND SIDNEY

A CLOSE TWO SHOT Sidney waits Bartha is white-lipped but
pushes the item back again

BARTHA
I dont print blind items

RESUME WIFE
She looks from Sidney to her husband and back

WIFE
What is this chess or checkers

RESUME BARTHA MRS BARTHA AND SIDNEY

The THREE SHOT favoring Bartha and Sidney Both Sidney and
Bartha are now aware of Mrs Barthas curiosity

SIDNEY
(pointedly)
Neither does Hunsecker
(fractional pause)
He likes to use the real names

A moment of chill silence Then Bartha gets to his feet
signals for a waiter As Sidney rises also

WIFE
Where are we running What am I
missing here

BARTHA
Waiter the check
(to wife)
This man is trying to hold a gun to
my head
WIFE
(abruptly)

Thats the horse Shotgun -
Shotgun in the fifth

She quickly studies her newspaper again As quickly Bartha
leans across the table and snatches it out of her hands In
doing so he upsets the glass of champagne which contains
only a few drops

SIDNEY AND BARTHA
Bartha turns challengingly to Sidney

BARTHA
(sternly)
What do you want to tell my wife
Sidney

WIFE
She is brushing her lap with her napkin
WIFE
(indignantly)
He wants to tell me that you poured
champagne all over my lap

RESUME BARTHA AND SIDNEY

Bartha ignores her again challenges Sidney
BARTHA
Go on tell her Im waiting

SIDNEY
(flustered)
What are you talking about Are

The Waiter arrives in picture beside them puts the check on
the table and goes Bartha picks it up

RESUME WIFE

Still mopping her dress with her napkin she waits for her
husband to speak

BARTHA
He glances unhappily at his wife

BARTHA
Lorry I cant let this man

MRS BARTHA BARTHA AND SIDNEY

A THREE SHOT favoring Mrs Bartha her husband and Sidney in
foreground

WIFE
Blackmail

Sidney decides to retreat He turns starts to go But
Bartha blocks his way holding Sidney and explaining to the
Wife

BARTHA
He wants me to print a dirty smear
item for keeping his mouth shut

A momentarily pause Then

WIFE

RESUME BARTHA
He is uneasy ashamed of himself

BARTHA
Foolishly Lorry and I hope youll

judgment Lorry bad tasteand
Im just sorry Lorry thats all

RESUME WIFE
She says nothing
RESUME BARTHA SIDNEY AND MRS BARTHA

The ANGLE favoring Bartha and Sidney Mrs Bartha in
foreground Bartha now turns on Sidney

BARTHA
Your friend Hunsecker - you can
tell him for me - hes a disgrace
to his profession Never mind my
bilious private life - I print a
decent responsible column - thats
the way it stays Your man -
theres nothing he wont print if
it satisfies his vanity or his
spite Hell use any spice to
pepper up his daily garbage Tell
him I said so and that like
yourself hes got the morals of a
guinea pig and the scruples of a
gangster

Sidney tries to brazen it out sneering

SIDNEY
What do I do now Whistle The
Stars and Stripes Forever

Mrs Bartha slides along the seat reaching for her fur
MRS BARTHA

CAMERA PULLS BACK with her as she collects her belongings
slides out between the tables and comes forward passing
Sidney to her husband

WIFE
(lightly)
What you do now Mr Falco is crow
like a hen - you have just laid an
egg
She presents her fur to her husband and turns her back
inviting him to put it around her shoulders

BARTHA AND WIFE

ANOTHER ANGLE favoring Bartha He has not fully understood
the significance of his wifes gesture He studies her
She confirms his hopes as she adds

WIFE
Leo this is one of the cleanest
things Ive seen you do in years

With the fur around her shoulders she turns and takes her
husbands arm with some pride They walk away CAMERA
ERASES BACK to include Sidney He is angry at himself -
more for the failure of his efforts at blackmail than any
sense of shame at the attempt

OTIS ELWELL

A MEDIUM LONG SHOT At a booth on the other side of the bar
sits a dapper gentleman with a twinkle of malice in his eyes
He has been watching the altercation with keen interest and
satisfaction Elwell gives some instructions to a waiter
who is serving him with drinks pointing towards Sidney

SIDNEY

Sidneys face shows a burning resentment He glances about
him to see how much of the embarrassing scene has been
observed As he moves away the waiter walks into shot
addressing him

WAITER
A waiter approaches Sidney He has a message

WAITER
Otis Elwell wants to see you Sidney

The waiter nods towards the other side of the circular bar
Sidney his humiliation and rage still burning looks off
towards

OTIS ELWELL

From Sidneys viewpoint Elwell beckons

SIDNEY
He comes round the circular bar He shows no eagerness to
join Elwell but approaches the table Elwell makes a
gesture inviting Sidney to sit Sidney doesnt accept it

ELWELL
(pleasantly)
I see Bartha gave you cold tongue
for supper
(as Sidney starts to leave)
Hey wait a minute

SIDNEY
(hesitating)
Im late for a date with a dame

Then returning he leans over the table addressing Elwell
with quiet anger

SIDNEY
Otis if youre trying to blow this
brawl into an item for your column -
forget it

REVERSE ANGLE

Across Sidney and Elwell Elwell is quietly enjoying
Sidneys display of hurt dignity

ELWELL
(affably)
How is dear old JJ by the way

SIDNEY
(his anger relapsing)
Call him up and ask - he might drop
dead with shock

ELWELL
(lightly)
If it were that easy you wouldnt
find an empty phone booth for the
next two hours

SIDNEY

A CLOSE SHOT While Elwell continues he is not looking at
Sidney Elwells expression of dislike of Hunsecker is not
overemphatic but Sidney senses nevertheless that it is
very real - and this gives him a new idea

ELWELL
(continuing over scene)
Talk of a wake - theyd club
each other to cater the affair for
free

RESUME ELWELL AND SIDNEY

Elwell looks up at Sidney as he continues

REVERSE ANGLE

ELWELL

(happily)
By the way did I hear something
about JJ giving you the flit gun
treatment - he shut you out of the
column
(amused)
Why

Sidney has rapidly resumed his manner of resentment
order to exploit Elwells dislike of Hunsecker)

ELWELL

He has lost

SIDNEY

You dont know that lunatic yet
Whims - egotistic whims Like the
gag - when you got him for a
friend you dont need an enemy

(a pause then)
Thats what the fight with Bartha
was about Leo I says Hunsecker
froze me out So Im eating humble
pie this month - please print me an
item

ELWELL
(pleased)
And instead he printed his heel
in your face

SIDNEY
(morose)
I see youre full of human
feelings

interest in Sidney

ELWELL
(with a shrug)
Like most of the human race
Sidney Im bored Id go a mile
for a chuckle
Elwells voice fades his attention has been caught by

REVERSE ANGLE

three people are passing the table squeezing their way
past a man with two very fetching young women Elwells
eyes are riveted to the anatomy that is temptingly displayed

SIDNEY
(noting Elwells preoccupation)
and two miles for a pretty
girl

ELWELL

He is unembarrassed at Sidneys all-too-accurate estimate

ELWELL
(lightly)
Threeeven four

Elwell turns back towards the papers on his table a zippered
document case and some publications among which a columnist
might search for scandal among these is a magazine of
semipornographic nature

ELWELL
(continuing casually)
Then youre really washed up with
Hunsecker

REVERSE ANGLE

The nature of Elwells reading tastes is also not lost on
Sidney With his eyes glancing at the magazine Sidney now
accepts the original offer to sit down He produces the
slip of paper that Bartha rejected offering it as
illustration

SIDNEY
This is how much Im washed with
JJ

As Elwell reads Sidney continues giving a passing scrutiny -
apparently casual - to a picture of a girl on the magazine
cover

SIDNEY
Look Otis I make no brief for my
bilious private life but hes got
the morals of a guinea pig and the
scruples of a gangster

Elwell shows no undue enthusiasm for the item

ELWELL
(dryly)
A fine fat dirty item
(offering it back to Sidney)
Whos it about

But Sidney doesnt take the paper back he explains

SIDNEY
A kid named Dallas who runs a
dinky jazz quintet
(he leans closer)
He keeps company with JJs
screwball sister

ELWELL

This does get a reaction a flicker of genuine interest
Elwell reads the item for a second time

SIDNEY AND ELWELL

Watching Elwell read Sidney encourages

SIDNEY
Its a real goody if like me you
wanna clobber JJ

Now Elwell lays the item down in front of him Clearly he
is considering it Sidney prompts again

SIDNEY
Hes got his TV tomorrow Hed
read it just before rehearsals

Elwell nods But he is still reluctant

ELWELL
(cautiously)
Mmm Trouble is I cant think of
any good reason why I should print
anything you give me I cant even
think of a bad reason

SIDNEY

Sidney drops his eyes to the magazine once more He fingers
it in a preoccupied but significant way

SIDNEY
(gently)
Suppose I introduce you to a lovely
reason Otis One thats good and
badand available

ELWELL

His eyes go from the magazine to Sidney he gets the point
alright

ELWELL
Im not an unreasonable man

Elwell reaches for the slip of paper once more
SIDNEY AND ELWELL

In picking it up Elwell clearly implies his readiness to
accept the item - on conditions Sidney in his turn gets
this point He turns towards the passing waiter

SIDNEY
Waiter The check

INT SIDNEYS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rita is in the bedroom She appears to have some familiarity
to the premises She hears the doorbell She makes swift
adjustment to her appearance and takes a swift gulp of a
drink as she carries it through to answer the door

SIDNEYS OFFICE

The outer room is lit only by one of the lamps on the desk
Rita crosses and goes to the door Sidneys shadow can be
seen through the frosted glass At the door Rita opens it
slowly and with a seductive manner

RITA

(coyly)
Hi

Sidney steps into the room Rita begins to close the door
prior to stepping into his embrace Sidney puts one arm

about her But now she reacts to

ANOTHER ANGLE
Otis Elwell stands on the landing outside In most
gentlemanly fashion he takes off his hat

RITA
This new arrival gets a dismal reaction from the girl
SIDNEY
(unembarrassed)
Rita say hello to Otis Elwell
RITA
(with no welcome whatsoever)
Hello
ANOTHER ANGLE

Elwell is not unaware of his cool reception He glances at
Sidney as he comes into the room But his manner is suave

ELWELL
Friends call me Otis - sometimes
Tricky Otis

SIDNEY

Otis was outraged when I told him
Van Cleve was going to fire you
Tell him not to pay any attention
to anything you-know-who says about
you-know-what

(to Otis)
Right Otis

ELWELL
Right

Elwell sits down on the sette stretches his limbs smiles
at the girl Rita still says nothing Sidney mistakes her
attitude for acquiescence He swallows his drink sets it
down

SIDNEY
I thought you two could talk the
whole thing over till I got back

Rita looks at him sharply

RITA
Back

SIDNEY
One of those business meetings
honey - always coming up in the
middle of the night

He grins at Rita She doesnt respond Turning she goes
swiftly through the door into the bedroom

RITA
(sharply)
Hold on You can drop me off on
your way

Emphasizing the asperity in her voice she closes the door
behind her

ANOTHER ANGLE

Elwell looks at Sidney Sidney looks at Elwell Elwell gets
up slowly from the settee

ELWELL
(amused by acid)
Consternation reigns

Sidney is uncomfortable not sure how Elwell is taking the
rejection Elwell glances at his wristwatch lays down his
drink

SIDNEY
(quickly)

Now Otis

Elwell shrugs remarks pleasantly but with significance

ELWELL
I hate JJ -- but not that much at
this moment

SIDNEY

Give me a chance --
He goes into the bedroom closing the door after him
INT BEDROOM
Rita is in a flurry of indignation Sitting on the bed she
is fastening one high-heeled shoe Sidney stands glaring at

her

SIDNEY
Dont you know who that man is
RITA
(bitingly)
Yeah Otis Elwell The columnist

SIDNEY
(nodding with emphasis)
Yeah

RITA
(aggressively)
And hes a perfect stranger to me

SIDNEY
(explosively)
So take five minutes Get
acquainted Hes an important
man - hes lonely - dont be dumb

Rita who one shoe on has begun to search for the other

RITA
What do you want all of a sudden -
Lady Godiva Wheres my other
shoe

SIDNEY
What kind of an act is this

Rita jumps to her feet Her righteous indignation is
handicapped by the lop-sided stance caused by the lack of
one shoe

RITA
Dont you think I have any feelings
What am I A bowl of fruit A
tangerine that peels in a minute

SIDNEY

(caustic)
I beg your pardon I turn myself
inside out to help you and now Im
a heavy

(stooping swiftly as

he discovers her shoe)
Heres your shoe theres your
coat thats the door

Contemptuously he thrusts the coat and the shoe into her
arms The positive force of his manner gives the girl pause
There is a silence Rita searches for words to explain the
offense to her sensibilities
RITA
SidneyII dont do this sort
of thing

SIDNEY
What sort of thing

RITA
(emphatic)
This sort of thing

SIDNEY
(as emphatic)
Listen you need him for a favor
dont you And so do I I need
his column--tonight
(then)
Didnt you ask me to do something
about your job Dont you have a
id in Military School

A pause Sidney has struck brutally home Ritas lower lip
trembles

RITA
Youre a snake Falco Youre a
louse a real louse

Sidneys manner becomes swiftly sympathetic - but still
urgent

SIDNEY
(persuasively)
Honey - hes going to help you
You want to lose your job

Rita begins to waver her moral indignation losing ground
before Sidneys reminders of her dire necessity

RITA
(remonstrating)
A girl needs a little romancing
before she -

SIDNEY
(cutting in)
Next time Ill call in a guy to
paint silver stars on the ceiling

RITA
(in a small voice)
What would you think of me if -
SIDNEY
(cutting in to
reassure her)
Nothing I didnt think of you before

RITA
(dryly with significance)
- thats what I mean

This attempt at humor signals to Sidney that he has brought
her round He comes to her pats her in an encouraging
manner - to which she does not respond

He turns to the door and picks up the glasses she has set
down on the table behind it

SIDNEY
(as he opens the door)
How many snorts does it take to put
you in that Tropical Island Mood

Sidney goes out

SIDNEYS OFFICE

Elwell overhears the last remark and as Sidney passes him
he winks While Sidney pours another drink Elwell faces
the doorway Rita comes into it stands on the threshold
She is still far from enthusiastic

ELWELL
(an inspiration)
Havana Thats where we met

Rita shakes her head morosely Sidney comes and puts a
stiff drink into her hand Elwell raises the glass toasting
the girl encouraging her to drink Rita responds dimly

RITA
(to Otis)
Heres mud in your column

Sidney laughs more from relief than from the joke

SIDNEY
Blessings on thee the bothwell
Gotta run now See you two kids
later

ELWELL
(lightly)
Hurry back
At the door Sidney takes cheerful leave of them

SIDNEY
Dont do anything I wouldnt do
That gives you lots of leeway

HALLWAY OUTSIDE SIDNEYS APARTMENT

Closing the door Sidney seems pleased with himself He
goes swiftly down the stairs

INT SIDNEYS OFFICE

Rita remains on the threshold of the doorway between the two
rooms There is an uncomfortable silence Elwell carries
it off by coming to the girl offering her a cigarette She
accepts it Elwell studies her smiling affectionately
Rita meets his eyes avoids them again then quietly offers
the information

RITA
Palm Springs Two years ago

Elwell begins to laugh Whatever the memory it seems to
amuse him vastly because he continues to laugh

ELWELL
(delighted)
Thats right

Rita drinks She adds glumly

RITA
Dont tell Sidney

Elwell continues to laugh as we
CUT TO
ORANGE JUICE STAND - NIGHT

Shooting east on 46th Street walks Sidney coming out of the
entrance of his apartment towards CAMERA He is pleased
with himself satisfied with his ingenuity in dealing with
Rita and Bartha

The streets behind him are dark and empty (it is about 300
in the morning) CAMERA moves with Sidney as he steps
briskly into the orange juice stand and lifts the receiver
from the pay telephone There are no other customers at the
counter but the man behind is squeezing orange halves for
the day ahead piling up a mountain of empties some of which
fall at Sidneys feet

The ringing of the telephone is heard in the big room - an
impressively furnished apartment which has a decor indicating
that the owner thinks of himself in epic terms

CAMERA moves to discover Hunsecker in robe and pajamas
tapping at his typewriter Taking his leisurely time he
picks up the phone and eventually answers it

HUNSECKER

Hunsecker is writing Robards name on his pad but he says
into the phone

HUNSECKER

He cradles the phone looks at it for a moment switches his
eyes and then physically follows them rising to stroll
towards the glass doors onto the terrace He moves out and
turns aside to look in at the adjoining window which
belongs to Susans bedroom

INT SUSANS BEDROOM - NIGHT

CAMERA shoots across Susan in foreground she is asleep a
tired helpless sweet kid The figure of her brother is
seen - a dark shape on the terrace outside He moves away
across the terrace

EXT TERRACE - NIGHT

Hunsecker turns from the window CAMERA is close on his
brooding face CAMERA tracks with him as he crosses towards
the parapet At this height there is a wind which blows his
hair and the movement of the camera emphasizes a remarkable
vista of the New York skyline The buildings are now dark
only a few of the electric signs are left on all night
CAMERA comes to rest looking over Hunseckers shoulder it
tilts downward to a view of Broadway below Duffy Square in
the distance

A close-up Hunsecker is looking down on his kingdom But
there is little love in the mans face only authoritarian
power

Gimme The Record

Sidney buys and opens the paper CAMERA MOVES closer to
shoot over his shoulder We see the gossip column which
bears a photograph of Otis Elwell at the top Smirking with
satisfaction Sidney turns away from the CAMERA and throws
the paper into a trash basket before he disappears into the
impressive entrance of a large office building The sign
above the doorway reads THE NEW YORK GLOBE

QUICK DISSOLVE TO

Mary Hunseckers secretary occupies a cubicle which is
separated form the rest of the newsroom by a partition

From the big room beyond comes the hum and chatter of a big
newspaper The walls of the urgent murmur of the staff of a
big newspaper The walls of Marys cubicle are covered with
photographs filing cabinets are piled high with unopened
mail two wire service teletype machines click desultorily
Mary is plain but attractive past 30 a level-headed woman
with a sense of integrity She is on the phone just now
bored with the insistent voice on the other end Beside her
an earnest young LAWYER waits with several papers in hand

MARY

(to phone)
I have no power to retract Mr
Cummings Im only Mr Hunseckers

secretary No Nor can I agree
that can retraction is necessary
Thank you for calling

Sidney has come through the newsroom in background He
pauses tactfully seeing Mary occupied with the lawyer

LAWYER
(huffily)
I fail to see whats amusing about
these papers

MARY
Ill get the boss to sign them

LAWYER
(giving her the papers)
Theyre important

MARY
Youve said that six times - thats

As the disgruntled lawyer leaves Sidney comes in wearing
his most winning smile With a glance after the lawyer
making sure that he is not observed Sidney greets Mary
assuming a brogue

SIDNEY
Hello Mary me darlin and phwat

Sidneys hand caresses her shoulder with a gesture which
indicates a certain intimacy between them

MARY
Thats a question I usually like to
ask YOU Your secretary phoned

SIDNEY

MARY
(shrugging)

Something about a Frank DAngelo
trying to reach you
Sidney reaches for the phone As he does so Mary hesitates
and glances at a copy of The Record which lies on the desk
open at Otis Elwells column She picks it up

MARY
(continuing)
Is that the man who manages Susies
boyfriend

Sidney murmurs casually Yeah Why as he dials Mary
holds up the paper indicating the item

MARY

Have you seen this In Otis
Elwells column

(reads)
The dreamy marijuana smoke of a
lad who heads a highbrow jazz
quintet is giving an inelegant odor
to that elegant East Side Club
where he works Thats no way for
a card-holding Party Member to act
Moscow wont like you naughty boy

Sidney accepts the paper from Mary examines the item while
he talks to Sally on the phone

SIDNEY
(into phone)
Sally I got the message If
DAngelo calls again tell him Ill
be at the office around noon

He hangs up continuing to read

MARY
Could this be that boy

SIDNEY
(casually)
Dallas Could be He doesnt look
like a reefer smoker

He discards the paper with a show of disinterest Mary
picks it up again

MARY
(looking at The
Record again)
If this is true JJs going to
hit the ceiling
Sidney moves around behind Mary His eyes are fixed on a
spike which sits on Marys desk On it is impaled a proof
of Hunseckers column Meanwhile he remarks

SIDNEY
Can it be news to you that JJs
ceiling needs a plaster job every
six weeks

INSERT

From Sidneys viewpoint Hunseckers column The shot is
just too distant for us to be able to read the print

SIDNEY AND MARY

Sidney is looking at the column Mary is concentrated on
papers before her Without looking up she is clearly aware
of Sidneys efforts to read the proof

MARY
(quietly)
Sidney you know that JJ doesnt
like people to look at the column
proof in advance

Sidney caught in flagrante laughs

SIDNEY
Mary Im not people - theres
Falco blood sweat and tears in
that column

He turns away changing the subject (apparently)

SIDNEY
How about dinner tonight

Mary turns to study him

MARY
Bribing me again

SIDNEY
(uncomfortable under
her scrutiny)
And why should I bribe the woman
who holds most of my heart

Mary is thoughtful Without malice in a detached sort of
way she examines Sidney
MARY
Youre a real rascal Sidney Id
certainly dislike you if I didnt
like you Youre an amusing boy
but there isnt a drop of respect
in you for anything alive - youre
too immersed in the theology of
making a fast buck Not that I
dont sometimes feel that you yearn
for something better

Sidney finds this analysis hard to take Again he tries to
laugh his way out of it

SIDNEY
(cynical)
Mary dont try to sell me the
Brooklyn Bridge I happen to know
it belongs to the Dodgers

Mary smiling decides to let him off the hook She takes
the spike and the column and passes it across to Sidneys
side of the desk as she returns briskly to her business

MARY
(affably)
I dont mind you looking at the
proof of the column in advance as
long as JJ doesnt know But
dont do it like a boy stealing gum
from a slot machine

Sidney doesnt like this but on the other hand he does
want to look at the column After only a momentary struggle
he picks the column off the spike and reads

SIDNEY
Who put this item in about the
comic
(reading)

If theres a more hilarious funny
man around than Herbie Temple at
the Palace youll have to pardon
us for not catching the name We
were too busy screaming Does this
Temple have a press agent

MARY
No Its one of JJs occasional
beau gestes Evidently the fellows
funny so he gave him a plug
He goes to the door grinning

SIDNEY
Whats your favorite ribbon to go
around your favorite chocolates

MARY
Lets wait till Christmas - its
more legitimate then

She looks after Sidney thinks about him for a moment Then
she types

EXT PALACE THEATRE - DAY

Sidney comes down 47th Street from Broadway making for the
stage door entrance of the Palace theatre He walks
confidently into the alleyway paying no attention to the
old doorman gossiping with the shoeshine boy at the chairs
next to the entrance The doorman turns protesting

DOORMAN
(calling out)
Hey

LAP DISSOLVE TO

Sidney without halting looks back towards the Doorman
addressing him with the patronizing manner of a superior

SIDNEY
Herbit Temple here yet

DOORMAN
Yeah but you cant come in now

SIDNEY
Im in Sonny Boy

He is already on his way into doorway
INT BACKSTAGE OF PALACE THEATRE

The movie will soon by finished and the comedian who opens
the stage show is ready and made-up in the wings He sits
with his agent (AL EVANS) a small worried bespectacled
man who waves an unlighted cigar as big as himself They
converse in loud whispers talking against the muffled and
echoing sound of the film sound track silhouetted against
the ghostly distorted images on the big screen seen at a
weird angle behind them
EVANS
I didnt waste words Herbie take
my word I says look Figo Im
not selling you a dozen eggs Im
selling you HERBIE TEMPLE I says
so dont gimme your lip

The comedian Herbie Temple looks up Sidney comes through
a fire-proof door which separates the stage from the
corridors to dressing room In background two chorus girls
in costume are squeezed into a telephone booth Sidney
joins the comedian and the agent he smiles to the comedian
while he addresses the agent

SIDNEY
Hiya Al

The agent looks from Sidney to Temple surprised and
displeased

EVANS
Since when did you two get
acquainted

Sidney has clearly never met Evans blandly he chooses to
regard the agents remark as an introduction he offers his

hand with generous amiability

SIDNEY
How do you do Mr Temple

The comic accepts the hand doubtfully

EVANS
(uncertain)
Delighted
SIDNEY

Im Sidney Falco

TEMPLE
(still dubious)
Yeah delighted

Evans stands up warns the comic
EVANS
Watch this guy Herbie hes a

press agent

Temples smile congeals
TEMPLE
You watch him Al I ssstutter

SIDNEY
(in no way discouraged)
Temple I caught your act the other
night and -

TEMPLE
Did you now On which bounce

SIDNEY
- and I just had to drop by and
tell you how great I thought you

were
TEMPLE
(dryly)
Cheers What time is it Al
EVANS
You got ten minutes
(to Sidney)

Hope you dont mind Falco were
busy and if -

Sidney stands up

SIDNEY
No I dont mind Im busy too

TEMPLE
(scowling)
Good Were all off to Utica so
excuse me Mr Frannis-on-the-
Portisan

Sidney moves toward the doorway onto the corridor The
chorus girls have now vacated the phone booth

SIDNEY
But can I ask one impertinent
question here With no criticism
intended because I know Al you
earn your ten percent how come you
let a sock act like Herbie Temple
tip-toe through town without a
publicity build

Smiling wise Evans shakes his head

EVANS
Were not buying it Falco - no
fish today

Sidney presses as if annoyed

SIDNEY
Im not selling Im just curious
thats all

Temple turns away from Sidney leaving him to Evans

TEMPLE
Answer the man Al if he asks you
a question Quick before he
thinks up another

Evans moves to Sidney trying to shepherd him out the way he
came

EVANS
Mr Temple doesnt believe in press
agents - does that answer you

something

ANOTHER ANGLE

Evans makes the mistake of laying a hand on Sidneys elbow
Sidney doesnt like people touching him He reacts in
anger as we have seen before - fixes a burning eye on Evans

SIDNEY

Take your hand off lump

(more politely to Temple)
No one believes in press agents
Temple when they make claims they
cant perform I got nothing to
sell - I didnt come here to
peddle - but if I tell a client
that Hunsecker will give him space
its not just talk

Sidney stops briskly up the stairs into the corridor
Evans angry is stalled for a moment of delay action by
mention of the magic name of Hunsecker

EVANS
(after hesitation)
Listen you bull artist -

TEMPLE
Let him go Al
SIDNEY

But Sidney has already stepped to the phone booth and is
dialing

SIDNEY
(to phone)
Hello Mary let me speak to JJ

REVERSE ANGLE

Shooting past Sidney in foreground onto Temple and Evans
beyond they watch him open-mouthed Sidney notes their
reaction

SIDNEY
(to phone)
Tell him its important

Sure Ill wait

While doing so he glances back with disinterest at Evans
and Temple The comedian and the agent exchange looks
Evans is uneasy he comes up the steps into the corridor to
address Sidney with a deflated manner

EVANS
(hesitant)
Look nobody hired you We didnt
talk any deal and -

With his hand over the mouthpiece Sidney addresses Evans
with contempt

SIDNEY
Relax lump I told you Im not
selling fish
(abruptly reverting
to the phone)
J3SidneyHow are you

(laughing)
Yeah

(then seriously)
Listen I know its late JJ but
is it too late to add something
important to the column

(grinning)
No not a relative but important

Shaking her head Gloria places the phone down on the desk
looks at it as it chatters away She considers returning to
her typing but worried picks the phone up again Sidneys
chattering voice is barely audible You know Herbie Temple

great Thats what about him And youd do me a big bunny
basket of a favor if you would say it in tomorrows column

RESUME BACKSTAGE PALACE THEATRE

Temple and Evans are now staring at Sidney with considerable
respect

Uhuh

The comedian and the agent in foreground Sidney still on
the phone beyond

SIDNEY

(then)
Its sweet of you JJ thanks
Probably see you at Twenty One

Right Bye
TEMPLE
Speak to this lad Al to Mr
Falco

SIDNEY
See me in my office

He turns and walks away down the corridor As he vanishes
Temple starts after him

CORRIDOR
Sidney walks off in the direction of the exit -- (not so
fast that he cant be overtaken) Temple hurries into the

corridor and comes after him Evans also follows though
not so eagerly

TEMPLE
Wait a minute
(turning back to
encourage Evans)
Speak to him Al
(to Sidney apologetically)
Al makes all my deals

Sidney permits himself to be detained

SIDNEY

(coolly looking

toward Evans)
I dont like a guy thats quick
with the hands

(to Temple)
Temple youve been three passes
behind for twenty years This
could start you off big - TV and
anywhere

Evans not as wholly convinced as the comedian comes up to
join them Temple looks at the agent

TEMPLE
And it would cost a pretty penny
huh
SIDNEY
(to Evans)

You tell him I stutter

EVANS
(shrewdly)
UhWhy dont we wait till tomorrow
Sidney shrugging makes a negligent exit

SIDNEY
(as he goes)

Wait as long as you like - you know
where my office is

They look after him Evans face is cold and suspecting but
Temples face contains fresh warmth

DISSOLVE TO
STAIRS OUTSIDE SIDNEYS OFFICE - DAY

Sidney comes briskly up the stairs Outside his door he
pauses listens hearing the murmur of voices inside Then
he walks in casually

INT SIDNEYS OFFICE - DAY

Sidney steps in closing the door He pretends surprise as
he sees

ANOTHER ANGLE

Steve and DAngelo waiting for him Sidney comes into
SHOT Sally remains at her desk while Steve and DAngelo
are silent looking at Sidney

SIDNEY
(perkily)
What is here a wake

DAngelo rises from the couch crossing to Sidney to hand
him a copy of the tabloid The Record It is folded open at
Elwells column As he passes it to Sidney DAngelo marks
with his thumbnail an item near the bottom of the column
Sidney takes the paper and reads (He reads a little too
quickly) Then he hands it back to DAngelo

ANOTHER ANGLE
Steve notes Sidneys too-perfunctory reading

STEVE
You read as you run dont you

Sidney turns on Steve coldly

SIDNEY
Its a habit with me So now Im
briefed So what

STEVE
(glancing at DAngelo)
Frank thinks I shouldnt have come
here -

DANGELO
(a quick correction)
Excuse me Steve I said namely
you shouldnt go around wild
blaming people without justification

STEVE
(watchfully to Sidney)
I thought you might have a faint
idea of how this item originated

REVERSE ANGLE

Favoring Sidney He pauses

SIDNEY
Why me

STEVE
Why not you

SIDNEY

Thats your idea of logic I tell
the Judge I didnt murder the man -
the Judge says Why not you

STEVE
Only two men in this town could be
responsible for that smear - you or
Hunsecker or both

SIDNEY
(explosively)
Dallas ask your own manager - hes
standing here like a pained
wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell
are enemies to the knife So how
do you get him doing JJ a favor

STEVE
(quickly)
It is a favor isnt it

SIDNEY
(as quickly)
According to you yeah

(continuing rapidly

and with heat)
Dallas your mouth is as big as a
basket and twice as empty I dont
like you comma but neither do I
go along with this column saying
you smoke marijuana and belong with
the Reds Also since were
talking repulsive JJ wont like
this for two cents Dont give me
that look Dallas - JJ believes
in fair play And secondly this
could splatter his sister with
rotten egg by implication - your
her boyfriend

RESUME REVERSE ANGLE

Sidneys manner is a little too vigorous (In adopting an
aggressive tone he is really trying to needle Steve)
Steve though on the verge of losing his temper is sharp
enough to notice the point

STEVE
Youre talking very fast

SIDNEY
(expostulating)
Well Ill tell you what - excuse
me for breathing will ya
(wheeling to Sally)
How do you like it He comes to my
office and -

DANGELO

Sensing the danger DAngelo moves forward soothingly
between them

D ANGELO
Boys this gets nobody nowhere -
youre over excited Steve and -

STEVE
(sharply)
Dont apologize for me Frank

D ANGELO
excited with good reason I
wanted to say
(to Sidney)
Because this endangers the future
of the whole quintet

SIDNEY
(lightly)
Should I cry

Steve with a glare at both men goes to the phone on
Sallys desk He dials

D ANGELO
(continuing)
People catch on quick to such an
item Van Cleve already called
me —- hes firing the quintet

SIDNEY
Then what are you doing here Go
over there and fight If Van Cleve
fires your boy it gives a lie the
ring of truth

In background Steve speaks quietly into the phone

STEVE
I want to speak to Miss Hunsecker
please

DANGELO

(replying to Sidneys question)
Were on our way there now

SIDNEY
(who has wheeled on Steve)
What are you calling her for

STEVE

Sidneys reaction to the mention of Susans name gives Steve
food for thought While he waits for Susan to be summoned
to the phone he studies Sidney

STEVE

(to Sidney)
Im the boyfriend remember I
hope one day shell be my wife

(into the phone gently)
This is Steve Susie Dont be
alarmed Susie but I want you to
look at Elwells column in The
RecordtodayNo about me
INT HUNSECKERS PENTHOUSE - SUSANS BEDROOM - DAY

Susan is on the phone Listening to what Steve says she is
frightened - almost too frightened it is as if in some
curious sense she had been expecting this blow It brings
an echo of an earlier tragedy

SUSAN
A smearWhatWhat kind of
smear Where are you

INT SIDNEYS APARTMENT

Steve is on the phone in foreground the others watching him
In particular Sally who stands near Steve is studying him
with obvious sympathy She looks slowly towards Sidney

STEVE
(to the phone)
Were on our way to the Elysian
Room to dicker with Van Cleve -
hes fired us already Ill call
you later dear Bye

He hangs up quietly looks at Sidney and walks towards the
door

STEVE
Come on Frank

ANOTHER ANGLE

As the door closes behind Steve Frank follows more slowly
As DAngelo reaches the door he pauses with his hand on the
doorknob and turns back to study Sidney

SIDNEY

He feels uneasy under DAngelos scrutiny Sally in
background is also watching Sidney

SIDNEY
(to DAngelo)
What are you looking at
DANGELO
He does not answer for a moment The unspoken accusation in

his look is very clear Then

D ANGELO
(quietly)
The ugly world Sidney

(a pause)
If I told Steve what I really
think hed tear your head off

RESUME SIDNEY

He brazens it out

SIDNEY
(sneering)
Tell him
RESUME DANGELO
DAngelo shakes his head
DANGELO

No Im interested in his future
DAngelo goes slowly out
RESUME SIDNEY

He hesitates before turning towards Sally (because he
realizes that this exchange with DAngelo must have confirmed
Sally in her suspicions)

SALLY

Her face shows that Sidney is right Sally is deeply hurt
disillusioned

ANOTHER ANGLE
Sidney turns to her challenging

SIDNEY
Whats the matter

SALLY
(not looking at him)
Nothing

Resentfully Sidney moves about the room Sensing the
silent accusation against him he is aggressive

SIDNEY
You know Sally sometimes I get
the impression you think you live
in Star-Bright Park This is life
kid - get used to it
Sidney comes to the phone on her desk He dials Then he
glances swiftly at Sally and carrying the phone walks into
the bedroom dragging the long cord behind him

INT BEDROOM

When the phone comes alive Sidney pushes the bedroom door
shut The gesture is as casual as he can contrive to make
it Keeping his voice fairly low so that it cannot be heard
in the other room he says

SIDNEY
(to phone)
Nikko is Mr Hunsecker there
This is Mr Falco Well have him
call me as soon as he can Its
important

He sets the phone down on the bedside table looks at it
thoughtfully before he goes back to the bedroom door opens
it and goes back into the office

INT OFFICE

Sidney stands on the threshold studying Sally His manner
is now more sympathetic as he asks

SIDNEY
Did you send my folks in Philly the
check

SALLY
Yes

Leaving the bedroom door open Sidney comes up to her
watches her shrewdly cautiously

SIDNEY
(softly)
I put a lotta trust in you
Chickie

SALLY
(low-voiced)
I know you do Sidney

SIDNEY
Dont judge a situation where you

dont know whats involved

Sally is putting paper in the typewriter trying to hold her
head up

SALLY
Im not judging

Sidney comes closer to her He puts his hand on the nape of
her neck carrassing her Under his touch the girl is
unhappy and yet at the same time responsive Sidney still
has power over her but she is disturbed by feelings of shame
Feeling her relaxed Sidney bends and kisses her on the side
of the throat with more than negligence for something about
her always excites him his aggression tune in with her
submissiveness

SALLY
(pathetically)
I swear Sidney I cant help it -
sometimes I wonder what I see in
you

SIDNEY
(murmuring)
Thats no way to talk

SALLY
Or what you see in me for that
matter

SIDNEY

Stay down town tonight Maybe
well take in a show etc

SALLY
If you want me to -

The phone in the bedroom rings Sidney reacting sharply
forgets his advances to Sally as he turns towards the bedroom

SIDNEY
(exhilarated)
You see Hunseckers gotta phone ME

He goes into the bedroom closing the door as he goes
Sally looks at the closed door

INT BEDROOM
Sidney has picked up the phone
SIDNEY

(calmly)

He bangs down the phone tense thought in his manner
INT SIDNEYS APARTMENT

Sally is busy with her typing again but in a depressed mood
when Sidney comes out of the bedroom to put the phone down
on her desk again He seems satisfied with himself smug
Sally watches him for a moment Then

SALLY
What are you going to do

Sidney prepares to leave the apartment His tone is full of
confidence self-assertive (For once Sidney is certain
that he is smarter more cunning than even Hunsecker)

SIDNEY
(the wise one)
Chickie a lotta people think
theyre smart You watch Theyre
dumb theyll do the work for me
Just watch

Sidney makes for the door goes out

Japanese butler comes in to remove the breakfast table

HUNSECKER
The table can wait No calls I

NIKKO
Pleased to do I will come back
later
HUNSECKER
(abruptly)

Did you put the bread out on the
terrace for the birds

NIKKO
Yes but they dont come no more
this time of year

Smiling Nikko leaves Hunsecker picks up a pencil and
makes a note on a pad about birds no doubt Abruptly he
looks up calling
HUNSECKER
Susie Come in a minute dear

She has been trying to pass unnoticed to her room She
comes forward to him her manner is serious and wary His
act is one of a tasteful Mammy singer but he is watchful
too

HUNSECKER
Susie youre very much in my
thoughts today

SUSAN
Why

HUNSECKER
What a question dear with that
newspaper in your hand

SUSAN
(pausing)
Did Sidney tell you about it

HUNSECKER
Yes he phoned I dont know this
boy too well Anything in these
charges

She shakes her head

HUNSECKER
Not being partial are you

SUSAN
(with quiet certainty)
No Im not Im not

He soothes smiles indulgent but watchful

HUNSECKER
Susie take it easy Ill trust
your judgment - you dont have to
protest with me

With a paternal gesture of affection he holds out his arms
inviting her into his comforting embrace Not wanting to
she walks into his open waiting arms

HUNSECKER
Why are you trembling dear
SUSAN
History repeats itself Everything
that happened to Alan Lesliebegan
with a smear like this

Hunsecker considers this gravely as if it was a new and
troubling thought

HUNSECKER
Yes

She leaves his arms he watches keenly

SUSAN
(incoherent)
Its just as if Ive seen a ghost
today
HUNSECKER
(quickly)

But that wasnt your fault dear
what happened to Leslie Ive told
you that a million times

He goes to her gently she appraises both him and her
wrenched life with brooding frightened eyes

SUSAN
Then whose fault was it JJ It
was someones fault wasnt it

HUNSECKER
(gravely)
I wouldnt have called the boy
exactly balanced

SUSAN
(stronger)
Alan was notunbalanced when I
married him And he was

notindifferent to women no
matter what they said
HUNSECKER
(simply)

Im not fighting with you puss
She gets up and walks around in considerable agitation

SUSAN
He never would have killed himself
if I hadnt gone through with the
annulment Dont you see that made
all the rumors seem true I should
have stood up for himnot run out

She turns to Hunsecker her manner firmer

SIDNEY
JJ I want you to get them back
their job Steve and the Quintet

HUNSECKER
(incredulously)
You mean theyve been fired already
on the basis of this crude smear

He walks away with a wag of indignation but turns asking

HUNSECKER
Susie youre sure there isnt some
fire where theres this much smoke

Susan shakes her head emphatically

SIDNEY
(earnestly)
I know Steve No

HUNSECKER
Then maybe you can tell me if hes
as solid as you say why does he
rap me every chance he gets

SUSAN
(involuntarily)
Sidney is a liar

HUNSECKER
Who said Sidney

SUSAN
(defiantly)
I said Sidney

Staring he pauses then he deftly changes the subject

HUNSECKER
You know dear were drifting
apart you and I and I dont like
that

SUSAN
I thought we were talking about
Sidney
HUNSECKER
(with rasp)
Let me finish dear You had your
say now let me have mine

SUSAN
(interrupting)
I havent said anything yet JJ
but if -
Susan hesitates Hunsecker waits for her to continue But

she isnt yet sure enough of herself or of the point she
means to make She turns away

HUNSECKER

(gently)
I started to say were drifting
apart A year ago in your wildest
dreams would you have walked by
that door without taking up this
situation with me Today I had to
call you in

SUSAN
Im taking up the situation with
you now

HUNSECKER
(interrupting)
Susie I want to help you--
theres nothing I wont do for you
Youre all Ive got in the whole
wide world

Hunsecker strides about elaborately playing on a note of
disillusion and pain

HUNSECKER
(continuing)
Well what have I got Alimony to
a pair of tramps Theyre of no
concern to me Its you who count
but dont get me wrong - I dont
intend to let you break your neck

again

SIDNEY
JJ3 you said you want to help
me - prove it

HUNSECKER
(quietly)
How

SIDNEY
Get Steve back his jobplease

HUNSECKER
(pausing)
He means that much to you

SIDNEY
(simply)
Yes
(then)
With your prestige it only takes
a minute - ten cents worth of
American Tel and Tel

HUNSECKER
Youre picking up my lingo hon

SIDNEY
(levelly)
I read your column every day

He looks at her with pursed lips and for a change some
real interest Her level straightforward manner has pinned
him down completely he shows a slow charming grin as he
goes for a private phone book

HUNSECKER
Susie I like this new attitude of
yours Youre growing up and I
like it I dont like it when
youre limp and dependent when
youre odd and wayward This gives
you a chance for real survival in a
very lousy world Because dont
forget dear you wont always have
me with you will you

SIDNEY
No I wont

He crosses to the white desk phone delaying dialing for a
moment

HUNSECKER
This Dallas boy must be good for
you Why not bring him around
today before the show This time
Ill clean my glasses for a better
look
Susan doesnt like this idea is evasive

SIDNEY
Im not sure I can reach him in time

HUNSECKER
(easily)
Sure you can if you want to and I
know youll want to
(then)
By the way whats your beef

HUNSECKER

Burton dont stand around If I
go over Ill cut some items off the
tail

Burton departs Mary whips a second sheet out of the
typewriter hands it to Hunsecker As he accepts it
Hunsecker looks off towards the auditorium

SIDNEY

SHOOTING towards the auditorium from Hunseckers viewpoint
Sidney mounts the steps onto the stage Seeing that the
columnist is surrounded but knowing that JJ wants to talk
to him privately Sidney loiters so that JJ can join him
as soon as he chooses to CAMERA PULLS BACK to include
Hunsecker Only momentarily distracted by private
considerations connected with Sidneys arrival Hunsecker
returns to the business of timing the script He clicks the
watch again

HUNSECKER

From Washington through to
Jefferson from Lincoln and FDR
right up to today - the Democratic
Way of Life Thats what the man
said Nowadays it doesnt export
to well

(then concluding)
But you knowand I knowthat
our best secret weapon is D-E-M-O-
C-R-A-C-Y

(dropping to a modest tone)
Lets never forget it ladies and
gentlemen

ANOTHER ANGLE

Sidney lingers beside the old movie star who is listening
rapt to Hunseckers words Sidney is less impressed with
JJds eloquence At the conclusion Mildred applauds

lightly She stands up and moves towards JJ JJ wants
to talk to Sidney but is frustrated by the old movie star

MILDRED TAM
Thats grand just grand JJ
(then anxiously)
Is my makeup all right You know
despite the scads of movies Ive
made Ive never appeared on TV
yet

HUNSECKER
(cutting her short)
Of course Mildred Of course
You look fine

(swiftly summoning Mary)
Mary help Miss Tam - anything she
wants shes our star today

Under the pretense of studying the typed script JJ walks
away across the stage Sidney strolls after him

ANOTHER ANGLE

A TRACKING SHOT Sidney comes up beside Hunsecker falls
into step beside him As they cross towards a water cooler
at the back of the stage they talk in rapid undertone

HUNSECKER
I got that boy coming over here
(a glance at Sidney)
Whats so funny

SIDNEY
(who is smiling faintly)
With a pocket fulla firecrackers -
good

HUNSECKER
(narrowly)
I think you loused this up but good
If I can trust my eyes and I think
I can Susie knows all about your
dirty work

SIDNEY
(shrugging)
Cant hurt
HUNSECKER
(incredulously)
Cant hurt I had to get him back
his job
SIDNEY
(smugly)

I like that too
(closer faster)

Look JJ we can wrap this up in
one neat bundle addressed to the
dumps - to oblivion Were going
great but please play it my way

I cased this kid

Know his ins and outsHes fulla
juice and vinegar just begging for
some big shot like you to give him
a squeeze Do little Sidney a
favor squeeze - You know JJ -
the porcupine bit - needles

HUNSECKER
But its too late I got him back
the job
SIDNEY
(impatiently)

No thats the point - he wont
accept your favor The manager
yes but not the boy

A pause Hunsecker renumerates

HUNSECKER
Well hes got her in a tizzy Ill
tell you that

SIDNEY
Sure he steams her up - wants her
to stand on her own two feet and
all that jazz

HUNSECKER
And whos feet is she on now

SIDNEY
Presumably yours
(a hasty addition)
Thats according to St Dallas

HUNSECKER
Whats this boy got that Susie likes

SIDNEY
Integrity - acute like indigestion

HUNSECKER
What does that mean - integrity

SIDNEY
(repeating as before)
A pocket fulla firecrackers -
looking for a match

(grinning)
Its a new wrinkle to tell the
truth I never thought Id make a

killing on some guys integrity

Hunsecker gives him certain slow begrudging admiration
HUNSECKER
Full of beans aint you But you
know that youll stand or fall by
what youre doing now

SIDNEY
(grins confidently)
Calculated risk Only we happen to
know JJ that you like me Im
your star pupil -- I reflect back
to you your own talent

Hunsecker permits himself a faint smile Burton is
approaching with script in hand

HUNSECKER
I wouldnt like to take a bite of
you youre a cookie full of arsenic

Sidney smirks He turns away and goes off towards the
auditorium in the background

EXT TV STATION - DAY

Frank DAngelo pays a taxi out of which he and Steve have
just emerged Frank turns towards the boy resuming a
conversation as they stroll across the sidewalk towards the
entrance of the theatre

STEVE
(depressed)
I still think hes responsible for
the smear

DANGELO
Not that Im convinced but youll
never prove it in a million years
(gently)
Steve youll do what you want but
it cant hurt he offers you an
olive branch - so today like olives

STEVE
I guess youre right but -

Steve completes the sentence with a slow shake of the head
compromise is a gesture which he finds very difficult

DANGELO

DAngelo studies the boy with a paternal affection
DANGELO
Steve sometimes its better not to
look at your own honesty but to
look the other man in the face
Not because youre my meal ticket -
which you are - but because I like
you and the boys please take my
advice we -

DAngelo stops halted by an expression which he sees in
Steves face

STEVE

He is looking through the glass doors of the TV Theatre no
longer listening to DAngelos words his face has hardened
in anger

INT TV THEATRE FOYER

From Steves viewpoint Sidney has come out of the curtained
entrance to the auditorium CAMERA PULLS BACK to include
Steve in foreground With a movement that suggests his
annoyance at discovering Sidney present Steve jerks open

the glass door and moves in

ANOTHER ANGLE

Susan is waiting in the foyer She is standing in a position
where she has not been able to see Steve until he enters

now she moves forward to greet him As soon as she is near
him she speaks in a quiet urgent manner

SUSAN
(in an undertone)
Steve before we go in - Id like
to

But she too is halted as Steve lays a hand on her arm
Seeing his look over her shoulder she turns

SIDNEY

He is already strolling forward to join them CAMERA PANS
with him to include Susie Steve and DAngelo

SIDNEY
Hey Susie - This is a real
surprise -- not one but three

Jds just finishing up his
rehearsal
STAGE

Hunsecker comes forward to the front of the stage looking
towards

STEVE SUSAN DANGELO AND SIDNEY

In the group that comes down the aisle of the empty theatre
RESUME HUNSECKER

He studies them then calls out

HUNSECKER
Looks like a wedding

REVERSE ANGLE

Hunsecker back to CAMERA in foreground he begins to whistle
The Wedding March to the rhythm of Steve and Susans walk

STEVE

He breaks the rhythm of his stride his face rigid
RESUME HUNSECKER

He descends to meet them his manner is full of welcome
REVERSE ANGLE

Susan nervously makes the introduction - Steve is nervous
DAngelo hangs behind warily Sidney is in background

SUSAN
Steve you remember my brother

STEVE and HUNSECKER
(together)
Of course

Steve shakes the hand that the smiling Hunsecker gives

HUNSECKER
Well son looks like you went out
and bought yourself a packet of
trouble

STEVE
Youve been very kind about it Mr
Hunsecker
HUNSECKER
Give Susie credit for that I took
her word that there was nothing to
the smear Matter of fact Ill
have my say about smears on the
show today Thats why Id like
YOUR personal assurance too

STEVE
(quietly)
Mr Hunsecker theres nothing to
that smear You have my sincere
word

HUNSECKER
(nodding judicially)
Ill by that son Now you owe ME
a favor
(pausing to Susan)
Be good to my kid sister

SIDNEY
(solemnly)
Yeah shes had a peck of trouble
for a kid

Hunsecker flicks a look at Sidney No one else warier by
the minute knows what to say Hunsecker purrs onward

HUNSECKER
Susie likes to keep her girlish
secrets But in her heart of
hearts I imagine Dallas that she
fancies you in an uncommon way
Now what about YOU son Not just
tom-catting aroundI hope

SUSAN
(quickly)
JJd Steve isnt

Hunsecker cuts her off with lazy good nature

HUNSECKER
Take it easy Susie He wouldnt
be much of a man if he didnt
understand my concern Would you
son

STEVE
(pausing quietly)
No I wouldnt
HUNSECKER
(nodding)
Serious as a deaconI like it I
like your style son In a world
of old rags and bones I like it
For instance take Sidney

Hunsecker crosses toward Sidney

HUNSECKER (CONTD)

If Sidney got anywhere near Susie
Id break a bat over Sidneys head

(smiling faintly)
Sidney lives so much in a moral
twilight that when I said you were
coming here he predicted disaster
You wouldnt take my favor -- youd
chew up the job he said and spit
it right back in my face

(sniffing)
Any truth in that

DANGELO STEVE AND SUSAN
Steve is thrown for a loss momentarily Frank steps in

DANGELO
No Mr Hunsecker and if I can
amplify --

HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

HUNSECKER
(motionless)
Dont amplify

RESUME DANGELO STEVE AND SUSAN

DANGELO
Steve wantsa thank you for this
favor He --

GROUP SHOT

SIDNEY
(provocatively)
Frank you dont listen JJ just
told you to shut your mouth

STEVE
(hotly)
Dont you think its about time you
shut yours Who are you to tella
man like Frank DAngelo to shut up

DANGELO
(warningly)
Steve that isnt important --

But Steve on a heated rip has turned to Hunsecker

STEVE
Does he have to be here in our hair

HUNSECKER

HUNSECKER
Why has he bothered you before

STEVE DANGELO AND SUSAN

STEVE
Is it news to you

HUNSECKER

HUNSECKER
Son lots of people tell me Ima
gifted man but I still cant see
around corners

GROUP SHOT

HUNSECKER

(tolerantly)
Just exactly what are you so hot
about

(waiting)
I mean I know its a difficult
thing to be an artist in this
crudest of possible worlds but --

STEVE
(impatiently)
Nuts Im not here as an artist
Im here as an average Joe who
happens to love your sister Susie

HUNSECKER
(with ironic smirk)
Well just be careful you dont
knock her down huh
Steve stops dead Then strangely and dangerously he picks
up Hunseckers smile On each mans face the smile broadens
and grows up into a chuckle from each but the meanness
still flickers around Hunseckers mouth Steve is out of
the net

HUNSECKER
(affably)
Frankly son you lost me on that
last hill Just give us the punch
line

STEVE
(agreeably)
No punch line Maybe I was just
admiring your know-how---yours and
Falcos

HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

HUNSECKER
Why do you keep coupling me with
Falco

STEVE DANGELO AND SUSAN

STEVE
(innocently)
Hes here isnt he Do you think
sir when he dies hell go to the
dog and cat heaven

HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

Even Hunsecker smiles Sidney likes neither the ridicule or
the turn of events He moves quickly past CAMERA

SIDNEY STEVE DANGELO AND SUSAN
Sidney comes round the row of theatre seats to attack Steve

SIDNEY
Lets forget cats and dogs and
other pseudo-literary remarks---
Ill just lay it on the line What
about that big rumpus in my office
today You were there Frank
Where according to St Dallas JJ
was responsible for the Elwell smear

HUNSECKER
HUNSECKER
Dont go wild Sidney

GROUP SHOT

SIDNEY
Wild Take a look at them and see
whos wild

Playing along nicely Hunsecker looks at Steve and Frank and
slowly removes his arm from Susan he pauses before asking
Dallas

HUNSECKER
What about that

DANGELO
(uneasily)
Steve was excitedhe didnt mean
it exactly the way its stated

here
HUNSECKER
(to Steve)
How did you mean it
SIDNEY SUSAN
What he likes to--- JJ I dont want to say---
With a roar Hunsecker takes them both out of play he stands

up
SIDNEY STEVE DANGELO

Hunsecker enters from behind CAMERA

HUNSECKER
Both of you keep quiet
(to Sidney)

Youve made more damage here in one
minute than a plague of locusts
If youre tired Susie sit down---
this needs investigation

(to Steve quieter)
How did you mean it

(waiting)
Come on lets go Lets go

Steve is cornered the other completely out of play He
pauses

STEVE
I dont take kindly to you and
Falco selling me ethics Whos the
injured party here you

HUNSECKER
(with contempt)
Right now youre in no position to
ask questions And your snide
remarks---

STEVE
(stronger)
Wait a minute I havent handed
over punishing privileges to you
YET Put the whip down and I might
respect what youre saying

Switching his leonine tail Hunsecker looks broodingly at

Susie Frank says one beseeching word Steve but no
one hears him

SUSAN

HUNSECKER

HUNSECKER
Susie did you know about this
accusation
SUSAN
(mutely)
No
HUNSECKER
(abruptly)

Before you leave son Ill answer
your question---Susan Hunsecker is
the injured party here

(balefully)
Or will I be hearing next that I
dont even have my sisters welfare
at heart

STEVE AND SUSAN

Steve hesitates defensively but cant resist a small smile
he moves nearer to Susan

STEVE
Mr Hunsecker youve got more
twists than a barrel of pretzels
HUNSECKER
(unturning)
You hear that Susie
(to Steve)
Continue please

STEVE
(shaking his head)
Im afraid I cant cope with them

REVERSE ANGLE
Susan in foreground Steve Hunsecker and Sidney beyond

STEVE (CONTD)
(simply)
Youre too shrewd for me so Ill
just be honest Susie and I love
each other if Im not mistaken
and we want to get married

Hunsecker pauses Sidney throws in a stage whisper

SIDNEY
Give him credit---the boys gall is
gorgeous

STEVE
Why dont we hear what Susie has to
say

HUNSECKER

(sardonically)

Thats stout of you Dallas but
Susie may not care to air her
dismal views in public

Steve walks to Susie trying to lift her with his hopes and
air of gentle urging and support

STEVE
Susie

SUSAN
She stares at the floor
RESUME REVERSE ANGLE

Hunsecker doesnt like the drift of things his mouth
tightens and he speaks to Susan with veiled warning
HUNSECKER
Susie as always is free to say
anything she thinks Go on dear
say exactly whats on your mind
dear

STEVE
Those dears sound like daggers
May I suggest that you stop DARING
her to speak

HUNSECKER
May I lift my eyebrows What is
this What are you trying to do

STEVE
(strongly)
Im trying to get Susie to stand up
to you But your manner is so
threatening that shes afraid to
speak

HUNSECKER
Son you raise your voice again and
youll be outa here on your golden
pratt

SUSAN

Suddenly Susan lets loose with restrained nervous energy
she is near to tears

SUSAN
Steve if only for my sake I want
this stopped And the same goes
for you too JJ

HUNSECKER
He interjects

HUNSECKER
(contritely)
Susie Im sorry if---

RESUME SUSAN

SUSAN
(bitterly)
Sometimes I think ALL men are
fools
Restraining tears she runs up the steps to the stage
STEVE HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

Steve looks after her Sidney watches intently Hunseckers
smile is frostily taunting

HUNSECKER
You see Dallas a plague on both
our houses
(then)
We may have to call this game on
account of darkness

Steve turns a blank-eyed stare at him Tension gone a slow
mumbling fatigue has set in Hunsecker plays it light

HUNSECKER
If looks could kill Im dead

STEVE
(slowly)
No I dont care about you --
youre fantastic My whole
interest if its not too late is
in Susieand how to undo what
youve done to her

HUNSECKER
(smiling)
And what have I done to her
besides not buy her a new fur coat
lately Sidney you were right --
the boys a dilly

STEVE

(stung)
Why Because I dont like the way
you toy with human lives - Your
contempt and malice Because I
wont be the accomplice of your
sick ego - and the way its crippled
Susie You think of yourself -
you and your column - you see
yourself as a national glorybut
to me and thousands of others like
me you and your slimy scandal

your phony patriotics - to me Mr
Hunsecker you are a national
disgrace

HUNSECKER
(blandly)
Son I dont fancy shooting
mosquitoes with elephant guns So
suppose you just shuffle along and
call it a day

He turns and stares away but Steve stops him with---

STEVE
But my day with Susie isnt over
yet and--
HUNSECKER
(cold)

Tenll get you fifty youre playing
hookey from a padded cell

STAGE

Hunsecker comes up the steps from the auditorium Sidney
following closely behind In background beyond Steve and
DAngelo are walking up the aisle to the exit CAMERA
TRACKS CLOSE on Sidney and Hunsecker Hunseckers face is
rigid Sidney close at his elbow whispers

SIDNEY
(softly)
You did it JJ you did it good

Sidney is full of confidence But Hunsecker barely hears
him (Hunsecker has been hurt very deeply by the boys
attack in particular by the appalling fear that what Steve
has said is the kind of thing which Susan may also secretly
believe)

ANOTHER ANGLE

Susan is still standing in the wings Mary is with her
obviously sympathetic The girl is drying her eyes with
Kleenex and Mary glances at her employer with a look of
reproach Hunsecker walks round the table obviously trying
to approach Susan seeing this Susan turns away and moves
further from him Hunsecker stops

HUNSECKER

There is some emotion in his face as he looks towards the
girl More gently he moves forward past CAMERA

SUSAN

Sensing the approach of Hunsecker behind her she moves away
again she is still crying but is trying to recover
Presently Hunsecker approaches her again He speaks very
gently soothingly comforting

HUNSECKER
(softly)
You in a mood Susie to run over
to Milgrims later and buy a few
new frocks

SUSAN
(a small voice)
No Im going home

Hunsecker again tries to come nearer to her

HUNSECKER
Want Sidney to drive you over

Ignoring the shake of her head he calls to Sidney

HUNSECKER
Drive Susie home

HUNSECKER

Again we see some emotion in his face as he studies the girl
His eyes flick towards the stage behind him where Sidney
stands watching He moves gently forward and then speaks in
a quiet voice which reveals how desperately he needs her
reassurance

HUNSECKER
SusieIId have to take it
very much amiss if you ever saw
that boy again

SUSAN

After a pause she turns towards him she looks him straight
in the face

SUSAN
(levelly)
Ill never see him again

RESUME HUNSECKER

He seems to take this as a gesture of forgiveness from her
Now he touches her His need for her is apparent he tries
to reach her tries to find an excuse to embrace her She
submits to this very passively
SUSAN

A VERY CLOSE SHOT We see the effort with which she is
controlling herself

RESUME TWO SHOT

Satisfied with this crumb of affection from his sister
Hunsecker lets her go Susan moves away still avoiding his
eyes Then she goes off towards the steps down into the
auditorium Sidney looks at Hunsecker then after Susan and
follows her

RESUME HUNSECKER
He goes back to Mary and the script He instructs her

HUNSECKER
Call Van Cleve Tell him he was
right Tell him I said the Dallas
boys are not worthy of his club

Poring over the typewritten pages he senses Marys eyes on
him He speaks to her quietly without raising his head and
there is still an undertone of feeling in his voice

HUNSECKER
(without looking up)
Maryfor Susies own gooddont
give her misplaced sympathy

Mary says nothing Hunsecker gathers his papers and with a
visible effort to resume his public personality turns
towards the machinery of the television broadcast in
background

INT TV THEATRE FOYER

Susan crosses towards the doors out onto the street Sidney
comes behind her watchful as he overtakes her near the
doors He goes past her to open the door for her

SIDNEY
Ill get you a cab

Susan stops dead
SUSAN

(coldly)
Get away from me
She goes out into the street Beyond we see a crushing cab
Hesitating Sidney adds

SIDNEY
JJ asked me to drive you over
and -

But Susan has already moved out of shot hurrying across the
sidewalk to hail the taxi

RESUME SIDNEY

Uncertain what to do whether to follow her or not he moves
after her

SUSAN

She has already opened the door of the taxi She turns to
see Sidney come up behind her As he enters SHOT she
repeats

SUSAN
I told you to leave I dont know
if Stevell ever talk to me again
and Im ready to blame it all on you

She starts to get into the cab

SIDNEY

Alert he moves to detain her (anxious to know exactly the
extent of her suspicion)

SIDNEY
Susie

ANOTHER ANGLE

As Sidney steps up he grasps at the door of the taxi
trying to hold it open but Susan pulls it shut catching
his fingers in the door Sidney steps back in pain

TAXI

It drives off down Sixth Avenue
SIDNEY

Nursing the injury to his hand he looks after the
disappearing taxi As he recovers from the pain his
expression slowly changes to one of thoughtful appraisal
(Susans suspicions maybe of less importance than some other
considerations)

DISSOLVE TO

INT TWENTY ONE CLUB WASHROOM - NIGHT

Hunsecker and Sidney are washing in adjoining basins Coat
off the former is in one of his punitive moods of silence
Sidney despite his throbbing bandaged finger
satisfied and self-confident He hums quietly

throws him annoyed side-glances

catch on

Sidney no longer hums after a moment

is feeling
Hunsecker

but Sidney refuses to

The following dialogue is spaced between the
washing the drying and hair-combing

HUNSECKER
So thats what integrity looks
like Well Im always willing to
learn
(later)
How is that slob DAngelo your
uncle

SIDNEY
My mothers side--her brother
That reminds me JJ Susie looks
run down She can stand a vacation
and so can you People say Oh
the great JJ hes made of

iron but you can use a rest guy

Sidneys cheerfulness annoys Hunsecker

HUNSECKER
What are you so chipper about If
I put a cross on every one of your
mistakes youd look like a
graveyard

SIDNEY
(smiling)
But not for anything I did today

HUNSECKER
Sidney I know human nature Susie
lied to me - shell see that boy
again

Hunsecker moves out of shot

SIDNEY

he answers
Youre right JJ - she wont give
him up but it doesnt matter
Because the real money ball is
the boy not Susan And if --

Hearing the sound of the door Sidney turns sharply CAMERA
MOVES to discover that Hunsecker has gone out Sidney
quickly finishing the brushing of his hair follows

INT DINING ROOM - 21 CLUB

Two waiters are fussing over Hunseckers table at which
places are already set for Sidney and Hunsecker Matre d
hands him an envelope as he passes

MATRE D
Mr Hunsecker this was to be
delivered to you personally -

When the columnist comes up to the table the waiters
quickly pull out the table for him Sidney comes to join
him Sidney gets some attention but considerably less
CAMERA MOVES CLOSER

HUNSECKER
These drinks are warm

WAITER
You said you like to have them on
your table

HUNSECKER

What are you a critic

WAITER
Ill change --
HUNSECKER
Forget it
(to Sidney)

The real money ball is the boy

SIDNEY

Yeah the boywere on the verge
of a farce a real farce As I see
it if Susie had stood behind him
today he might have proved a threat
But since primarily hes wedded to
his work hes not going to be able
to take it

A waiter shifts the position of the salad dish at Hunseckers
elbow

HUNSECKER
(to waiter)
Stop tinkering pal - that horse
radish wont jump a fence

The waiter retreats rapidly

SIDNEY
In brief JJ its all over
because any hour now the boy will
give her up Is it a farce or not

Delicately salting his oysters Hunsecker looks obliquely at
Sidney

HUNSECKER
This syrup youre giving out
Sidney you pour over waffles not
JJ Hunsecker What do you mean
that lousy kid will give up my
sister

Hunsecker with a casual gesture tugs lightly at the end of
Sidneys tie

Hunseckers gesture is playful but it inflicts great injury
to Sidneys dignity Sidney cannot bear to be touched he
finds this liberty on JJs part as intolerable as anything
he has experienced and only with great difficulty controls
himself The SHOT FAVORS Sidney

SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER

Hunsecker continues

HUNSECKER
Are you listening

SIDNEY
(warily)
How does it matter whos sister
The main thing theyre through
and -

HUNSECKER

From Sidneys viewpoint Without turning Hunsecker
interrupts

HUNSECKER
Am I supposed to forget how that
boy talked to me today

RESUME SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER
Sidney senses a warning in Hunseckers manner He protests

SIDNEY
J3 is he worthy of a second
glance from a man like you Is he
I mean

HUNSECKER

From Sidneys viewpoint Pausing during the process of
eating Hunsecker reaches into an inside pocket

HUNSECKER
Brief epitaph The boy was talking
when he should have been listening
(then)
Bite on this

CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Sidney as Hunsecker tosses in
front of him an envelope Sidney opens it extracts two
steamship tickets

SIDNEY
Steamship tickets

HUNSECKER

(as he eats)

For the next sailing of the Mary
Susans run down - shes never been
abroad and as you so cogently put
it Im not made of iron

Sidney slowly pushes the envelope back to Hunsecker who
leaves it lying on the table before him

SIDNEY
Thats good Now that louse is
outa Susies hair for good
SIDNEY
He has an instinct to laugh but something tells him not to

HUNSECKER

As Sidney makes no response Hunsecker slowly carefully
continues in a voice which is dangerously soft
HUNSECKER
I want that boy taken apart

SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER

SHOOTING ACROSS Hunsecker onto Sidney Sidney puts down his
fork He sees now that the issue is serious and must be
faced

SIDNEY
(seriously)
Why do something that would drive
them right back into each others
arms Not to mention that this
time Susie would know who shot the
arrow

HUNSECKER
(interjecting quietly)
She knows now

SIDNEY

(quickly)
Why give her real proof You
nearly ruined her with her first
husband - and you were right
JJd - but she almost followed him
out the window What do you want -
a chronic invalid

HUNSECKER

He wants no advice from Sidney He interrupts with quiet
savagery

HUNSECKER
I know how to handle Susie You
just handle the boy Sidney
(scribbles on scratch pad)
preferably tonight
(pushes pad across to Sidney)

SIDNEY AND HUNSECKER

SHOOTING ACROSS Hunsecker onto Sidney Sidney feels sick

SIDNEY
Why whats tomorrow - a holiday

CAMERA MOVES CLOSER as Sidney picks scratch pad up We can
read two words Get Kello
SIDNEY
I think Ill go home - maybe I left
my sense of humor in another suit

HUNSECKER

Hunsecker finishes eating During the ensuing speech which
he begins quietly and sensibly Hunseckers venomous feelings
are unexpectedly betrayed

HUNSECKER
Youve got that God-given brain -
learn to use it Do you think its
a personal matter with me this boy
Are you telling me I see things in
terms of personal pique Dont you
see that today that boy wiped his
feet on the choice on the
predilections of sixty million men
and women of the greatest country
in the world If you had any
morals yourself you would
understand the immorality of that
boys stand today It was not me
he criticized - it was my readers

CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Sidney Hunsecker manages to
control himself he reaches with nervous fingers toward his
scribbling pad

SIDNEY

Sidneys face has tightened He has begun now to realize
the extent of this mans megalomania After a moment he
says

SIDNEY
Im leaving JJ

HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY
SHOOTING ACROSS Sidney onto Hunsecker
HUNSECKER
(a quiet warning)
Dont remove the gangplank Sidney
you may wanna get back on board

SIDNEY

Sidney feels the chill of despair upon him
HUNSECKER
This crab gumbo - terrific

HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

SHOOTING ACROSS Hunsecker onto Sidney A waiter has come to
serve the next course Hunsecker appears relaxed but
Sidney is sightlessly staring at the piece of paper in his
hand He speaks with a quaver in his voice for he has
worked hard to make a life which is now ready to relinquish

SIDNEY
JJ its one thing to wear your
dog collarbut when it gets to be
a nooseId rather have my freedom

HUNSECKER
The man in jail is always for
freedom

Sidney begins to get up from the table

SIDNEY
(as he rises)
Except if youll excuse me Im
not in jail

Hunsecker looks up at Sidney
HUNSECKER
From Sidneys viewpoint
HUNSECKER
(easily)
Sure youre in jail Sidney
Youre a prisoner of your own

fears of your own greed and
ambition youre in jail

SIDNEY
From Hunseckers viewpoint

SIDNEY
JJ If youre trying to -

He leans over Hunsecker and the CAMERA PULLS BACK to include
Hunsecker in fg

HUNSECKER
(interrupting)

You little boy dont know who you
are Talking around corners with
the big shots ten dollar dinners -
fourteen suits and cashmere coats -
you tell yourself THATS who you
are Later you wont know who you
are without a penthouse on upper
Park But underneath it all
ratting around from day to day you
DO know who you are Youre a
fearful ignorant nobody - a poor
wop kid from the slums of Philly -
hoping nobody else finds it out

SIDNEY

A CLOSE UP He knows the truth of what is said But he

takes refuge in quiet retaliation

SIDNEY

A little hunch occurs to me - you
have just painted a self-portrait
You know who YOU are because you

scare people - thats what youve

got against this boy He

HUNSECKER
Hunsecker is prepared to give it out

HUNSECKER
(cutting in)

but not take it

I told you what I want you to do

tonight

SIDNEY

He looks down on Hunsecker leans over the table

SIDNEY
Youre blind Mr Magoo

This is a

crossroads for me I wont get
Kello Not for a life-time pass to
the Polo Grounds Not if you serve
me Ingrid Bergman on a plate

CAMERA has PULLED BACK to include Hunsecker whose attention

has returned to his food

HUNSECKER
(over patient)
Sidney I told you -

SIDNEY
(continuing)
JJ I swear to you on my mothers
life I wont do it
(he leans even closer)
If you gave me your COLUMN I
wouldnt do a thing like that

But as he speaks the last words Sidneys voice falters
because he has glanced down at the table

SIDNEY

We see that an idea has entered his head - an idea that
takes the wind out of his indignation His eyes lift
rapidly to Hunseckers face

HUNSECKER
(delicately touching
the envelope)
And who do you think writes the
column while Susie and I are away
for three months

RESUME SIDNEY
He is quite speechless Over scene Hunseckers voice

HUNSECKER (VO)
(continuing)
The man in the moon

HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY

CAMERA SHOOTS across Sidney again onto Hunsecker Hunsecker
leans back looks at Sidney

Seeing that Sidney has accepted the proposition he smiles

HUNSECKER
(softly)
Thank you Sidney

In a pleasantly affable way he leans across the table to
tap the hand with which Sidney is leaning on the table

HUNSECKER
And Sidney Ill have that piece
of paper back
Helplessly Sidney unclenches a fist and reveals the slip of
paper which he had meant to keep Hunsecker takes it With
his eyes on Sidney he slowly tears it up

CIGAR STAND AND PHONE BOOTH - EVENING

DAngelo is buying a cigar at the counter He turns as
Steve opens the door of one of the booths and comes out
Steve is in a gloomy irksome mood DAngelo is sympathetic
and fatherly

STEVE
Shell be down in a minute

CAMERA TRACKS with them as they come out into the hallway
They move towards the side entrance away from the elevators

D ANGELO
What does she wanna see you about

The boy shrugs impatiently

STEVE
She didnt say

Some passersby come down the hall and enter a waiting
elevator barely glancing at DAngelo and the boy DAngelo
feels uneasy

D ANGELO
I could think of better places to
meet her instead of here He
lives on the whole top floor

STEVE
(carelessly)
I doubt that it matters any more

DANGELO
He addresses Steve soberly

DANGELO
Steve You made a very dangerous
enemy of him today Matter of
fact Im very glad we got the tour
ahead If Im any judge you hurt
him today where he lives He
wont forget it and he wont
forgive
RESUME STEVE AND DANGELO

Steve is silent He hears the sound of the elevator door
opening and turns

Susan comes out of the elevator the one farthest from them
and looks around

SUSAN
(as she comes forward
to join them)
Good evening Mr DAngelo

DAngelo acknowledges her greeting touches his hat and
retires tactfully Susan faces Steve Its an awkward
meeting Each does not know where the other stands She
has thrown her fur coat about her shoulders like a cloak it
will keep slipping off He is faintly embittered a little
hurt and baffled but he is sympathetic he is involved and
concerned

MED CLOSE TWO SHOT OVER SHOULDER - SUSAN TO STEVE

SUSAN
Hello Steve Im glad you could
come

STEVE

Why did you call me

SUSAN
Would you buy me a cup of coffee
In there

REVERSE ANGLE
Susan nods in the direction of the door into the little cafe

STEVE
Sure

As he walks with her towards the cafe
STEVE
Were on our way to Robards for a
benefit Ive only got five
minutes

INT CAFE

As they enter the cafe the Counterman looks up from counting
the days take at the far end

COUNTERMAN
Too late for service

STEVE
Just two cups of java

COUNTERMAN
(with a twinkle)
We serve here only moka coffee

STEVE
(smiling faintly)
Make it moke

The Counterman goes to the urn for the coffee
SUSAN AND STEVE

A closer angle They talk in quiet undertones Steve waits
for her to speak first she starts slowly hesitantly with
difficulty

SUSAN
Stevewhat you tried to do
todayyou tried to take me up on
a high mountainI couldnt go all
the wayI failed you

(a pause)
Will you forgive me
(then)
Have I lost you Steve Have I
STEVE
Well maybe I was wrong too But

theres no doubt Susie that we
have to face some serious things

SUSAN
No ones ever stood up to my
brother the way you did

STEVE
(quietly to the point)
But you didnt do much about it
Susie You walked out and there I
wassoloand not too good at
that

SUSAN
I just didnt think that I could
antagonize him Steve -- for OUR
sake I mean

STEVE

STEVE
Susie I was there for OUR sake
too But what a world it would be
if we were all afraid to learn to
walk and talk because it might
offend poppa By the way I think
your brother was completely
responsible for the smears

SUSAN

This accusation is made lightly in passing But Susan
reacts to it trying to interject

SUSAN
Steve I

STEVE

(overriding her)
But I dont care about that now
He knew what he was doing today
He was laying down the conditions
under which he MIGHT consent to our
marriage - if I would bend to every
whim of his like Sidney I
couldnt do that Susie

SUSAN
After a pause she says

SUSAN
Youre saying goodbye arent you

SUSAN AND STEVE
Steve flares up

STEVE
No Im saying that for your sake
you have to make a clean break with
your brother

SUSAN
(wrenched)
But please Steve please - one
step at a time I was born only
yesterday

STEVE

(pausing softer)
I told your brother I couldnt be
his accomplice I cant be yours
either Susie and encourage him to
go on pulverizing you I know what
type - hes my old man all over
again

Susan pathetically despairing fingers the handle of her
coffee cup which she has not touched The coat slips from
her shoulders

ANOTHER ANGLE

Steve stoops to pick it up replaces it on her shoulders

STEVE
This beautiful coat is more than
just a coat I hate it Itsa

mink straight-jacket
Susan turns to him She is deflated lacking all will power

SUSAN
(drooping)
Steve I feel exhaustedwhat do
you want me to do

STEVE
(not sure of himself)
Not what youre doing now At
least dont ask me - dont ask him
Youre fighting for your life
What do YOU want to do

SUSAN
(pausing woodenly)
You are saying goodbye arent
you

STEVE
He reacts vigorously protesting

STEVE
(impatiently)
Thats fish four days old I
cant buy it Susie Right out of
that mouth I love like youre a
ventriloquists dummy your BROTHER
is saying goodbye Geeyou want
me to be honest dont you

SUSAN
A despairing cry

SUSAN
No Steve I dont I dont Not

SUSAN AND STEVE

It takes her a moment to recover When she does so she
gets up leaving the counter

SUSAN
(without luster)
Lets not talk any moreyou have
to go

She moves towards the exit into the hallway he follows
HALLWAY
DAngelo is waiting for them Silently they come up to join

him very depressed Susan looks towards DAngelo speaks a
little pathetically

SUSAN
Goodbye Mr DAngelo Take care
of Steve
D ANGELO
(softly)

I will Miss Hunsecker

He walks a little way down the corridor again leaving them
alone

SUSAN AND STEVE
She smiles at him trying to smile trying to make a joke

SUSAN
Say something funnyMr
Hasenfeffer

Steve steps to her quickly kisses her Then he turns and
swiftly walks off down the corridor without a backward
glance He goes past DAngelo who walks quietly after him
towards the exit in background

SUSAN

She remains just in the attitude in which he left her
EXT BRILL BUILDING - NIGHT

Steve comes out of the door pauses without looking back
DAngelo comes up behind him

STEVE
(after a moment)
Look back Frank see if shes

DAngelo looks discreetly over his shoulder

From DAngelos point of view She is still standing where
Steve left her

RESUME STEVE AND DANGELO
DAngelo turns back to Steve

D ANGELO
Still there

Steve still without looking back walks up the street
CAMERA TRACKING WITH THEM

DANGELO

(with sympathy)
Not that I dont like her - shes a
very lovely person but who can
tell A year from now you might
thank your stars that it turned out
this way

(changing the subject)
By the way Robard said that

Steve his manner full of pain stops

STEVE
Frank I dont want to make the
benefit Theyll be jammin all
night and the way I feel -- Id
like to be alone -- Id like just
to walk and walk and never come back
DAngelo takes him firmly by the arm

devoted Frank he shrugs They walk past CAMERA

anxiously CAMERA PANS with Susan towards the door to the
apartment Susan fumbles for her key

INT HUNSECKERS PENTHOUSE

The apartment is dark as Susan enters She does not switch
on the lights She walks through the shadows of the big
room which has a grim and menacing atmosphere She kicks
off her shoes and hugging the coat about her for warmth
walks to the glass windows of the terrace After a moment
she opens them and steps out

EXT TERRACE - NIGHT

Susan walks across the terrace At this height the wind is
very strong CAMERA TRACKS with the girl emphasizing the
dizzying panorama of New York at night The girls manner
is strange she moves as if under compulsion a sleepwalker
When she reaches the stone parapet she leans against it
with her body slumped still hugging the fur coat as if it
were some protection against her misery

EXT FROM THE TERRACE - NIGHT

Vertically downward From Susans point of view The stone
sidewalks of Broadway are a terrifying distance below

SUSAN

An angle shooting sharply upwards against the night sky
Wind blows the girls hair as she looks fixedly downwards
Her face is blank expressionless (For a moment we may fear
for her afraid that she may have suicide in mind) But
presently she lifts her head looking towards the horizon

DETAIL

As he hangs up his coat Sidney identifies the other coat a
black and white check raglan which he (and we) saw Steve
wearing when he visited Hunsecker at the TV Studio

advances on Sidney DAngelos manner is unfriendly for an
instant we feel like Sidney that DAngelo may have seen
Sidney tampering with Steves coat but then we are reassured
as DAngelo deliberately using Sidneys surname says

situation) He turns away moving out of shot

From Sidneys viewpoint A LONG SHOT of Steve on the
bandstand CAMERA PANS deliberately towards the coatrack in

finding something gruesome in his relaxed manner

resentful manner

SIDNEY
Cant you wait up the block Its

uneasiness He begins to cat and mouse Sidney

KELLO
(heavily humorous)
Its nice Sidney that you give me
this tip

SIDNEY
(interjecting)
- Hes got them on him

KELLO
(solemnly nodding his approval)
And hes got them on him I
appreciate a thing like that - I

deigning to respond As he goes by Kello grasps him
forcibly by the arm

be so lonely without one real
friend in the world - to have to
hang on to a worthless rag of a
girl like me because shes his only
real family -

SIDNEY
(moving towards her again)
Come on now chickie why dont you
go to bed

Now she turns to him
SUSAN
And Im sorry for you too Sidney

SIDNEY
What ship

She walks past him still aimlessly wandering about the
room then she turns back indicates herself

SUSAN
THIS ship

She studies Sidney

SUSAN

stainless sister to suicide

SIDNEY

He cant go Probably shes bluffing But he cant be
certain He is suddenly angry

RESUME SUSAN AND SIDNEY

He strides back towards her

SIDNEY
Susie whatever problems you have
with JJ - I didnt invent them

Whatre you blaming me for If you
learned to let out your hatred you
would be better off
SUSAN

SIDNEY
Yeah Like me I dont choke on
my own gall - I fight back Let
THEM choke not me

SUSAN
Im not a man Sidney Im -

SIDNEY
I know that bit - youre a girl
you need a man to give you strength
So what do you pick such weak
sisters for Dont you know yet
that you fight fire with fire not
with tear drops

SUSAN
I could almost forgive you if what
you did to Steve came from jealousy
and love

SIDNEY
(quickly)
I didnt do anything

SUSAN
but you did it for greed
Sidney - and thats pathetic

She moves past him He grips her turning her around

SIDNEY
Dont run away - I was always the
man for you Im talking to you
out of two years of silence -
listen to what I say Inside of
six months -

SUSAN
(helplessly)
Please Sidney I cant stand this -

CAMERA HOLDS Sidney and Susan in foreground But it is now
shooting towards the door of the apartment A PANNING
movement has included a figure at the other end of the big
room

HUNSECKER
He is taking off his overcoat near the door of the apartment
We dont know how long he has been there how much he has
overheard Without appearing to be consciously spying
Hunsecker is listening to Sidneys voice over scene

SIDNEY
(over scene)
Listen to me lunatic All your
life youve been doing penance for
crimes you never committed I
could change that Id teach you
Id show you -

CAMERA PANS round with Hunsecker who strolls across the

room making his presence known Sidney breaks off drops

his hands releasing the girl Susan turns towards Hunsecker
Hunsecker lays his briefcase and papers on the table He
addresses Susan without looking at her

HUNSECKER
Go to bed Susie Its late

Susan makes no move Hunsecker glances at her sees Sidney
but treats Sidney as if he were invisible

HUNSECKER
(to Susan)
What is he doing here

Susan walks towards Hunsecker

SUSAN
I called him

Sidney moves forward also

SIDNEY
(carefully)
She was depressed - she heard about
Dallas

Hunsecker still ignores his existence he walks past Susan
carrying his papers to the desk Susan turns watching him

HUNSECKER
(controlling his feelings)
That subject it might be better not
to start me on
(angry)
Hes made all the papers tonight
Hunsecker studies the item in the paper
SUSAN

She is staring at her brother Suddenly she is unable to
suffer his authoritative air she goes to him he ignores
her

HUNSECKER AND SUSAN

Childishly she snatches the paper from his hand throws it
to the floor He looks at her Patiently as with a
hysterical infant he stoops recovers the paper

HUNSECKER

(mildly)
Is there something you wanted to
say

(as she does not

answer continuing

with growing viciousness)
Ive put up with a lot of your
guff Susie because you were a
child But youre a woman now and
I suspect despite my best
intentions more than a bit of a
slut

SUSAN
Her head comes up sharply at the insult

HUNSECKER AND SUSAN AND SIDNEY

Hunsecker glances at Sidney clearly reminding them of the
compromising situation in which they were found Sidney
moves to answer

SIDNEY
(quickly)
Jd if you think -

SUSAN
(cutting in)
Dont explain Sidney It doesnt
matter now
HUNSECKER
(continuing)

Whose arms will I have to pry you
out of next Not that I dont
think you didnt invite it I know
that look of yours that pose of
being wronged - and how it arouses
the crusading instinct in even a
Sidney Falco -

Hunseckers rising tide of brutality is having some effect
on Susan and Sidney fearing for her tries to intervene

SIDNEY
I was trying to build her up not
tear her down -

HUNSECKER

(viciously)
Is that why you were romancing her
you mutt

(turning back to Susan)
Lets call it quits my dear Id
like it fine if you found another
home That means the front door is
open Pack your things rent a
moving van and GIT

(pacing the room)
And as for marriage let me hit you
with a few choice facts you arent
ready for marriage Youre
incompetent - a capricious and
shaky frail with a sick fatality
for frail and useless men

Susan is staring sightlessly at the floor near Hunseckers
feet After a moment she turns and moves to the door of her
bedroom her walk is a little unsteady she goes inside
closes the door in Hunseckers face

INT BEDROOM

With the door closed she leans against it as if afraid of
falling She gropes for the door handle finds the key and
turns it

INT LIVING ROOM - HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY
Hunsecker is studying the closed door

HUNSECKER
(to himself)
Another crisis past
(walking away)
Shell be fast asleep in five
minutes loaded with those headache
pills
SIDNEY

Sidney seems not to hear this remark He is concentrated on
the door he moves hesitantly towards it apprehensive
CAMERA includes Hunsecker in background

HUNSECKER
Now well get to you Sidney
(turning to Sidney)
As far as the column is concerned -
tonight you have forfeited every
ethical consideration I ever felt
for you

Much more concerned with his anxiety for Susan Sidney
interrupts

SIDNEY

(cutting in)
Look JJ Ill grant you anything
you want

(as Hunsecker is

about to interrupt)
Susies off her rocker tonight Go
in and see what shes doing Go in
and talk to her quietly - unless
you want a corpse

Sidneys conviction is impressive But Hunsecker is
unwilling to admit the danger he continues

HUNSECKER
(acid)
Let me finish what I started to
say -

Seeing that Hunsecker is not taking his advice Sidney
strides swiftly to the door of Susans bedroom He knocks
on it

INT BEDROOM
SHOOTING TOWARDS the door Susan is sitting on the bed in

foreground In a methodical hypnotic way she is destroying
the contents of the drawer tearing letters into small

fragments Sidneys voice is heard outside Susie Susan
appears not to hear it CAMERA TRACKS closer to her
Sidneys voice is heard again louder Susie Susan turns

sharply towards the door

SUSAN
A CLOSE UP Susan rises to her feet staring at the door
She begins to back away from it

RESUME REVERSE ANGLE

CAMERA PULLS BACK as Susan glances down at the record player
beside her She turns the knob We hear the clatter of a
record dropping and music begins The tune is The Sage

INT LIVING ROOM
CLOSE SHOT of Sidney He hears the music starting

HUNSECKER

Hunsecker has come forward But now as he listens to the
gramaphone record playing in the bedroom Hunsecker relaxes
assuming that this is a sign that Sidneys suspicions are
unfounded

HUNSECKER
(coming forward)
What a cornball you are Sidney

CAMERA TRACKS to include Sidney He does not share
Hunseckers confidence he knocks again calling

SIDNEY

RESUME LIVING ROOM

A DETAIL SHOT Sidneys hand is still shaking the doorknob
He releases it CAMERA PULLS BACK to a TWO SHOT of Sidney

apprehension Now Hunsecker has begun to share Sidneys
anxiety He moves to the door knocks and then pounds on it

HUNSECKER

A CLOSE UP She comes forward past the blowing curtains
The wind whips at her hair Over scene we hear the rumble
of the traffic on Broadway far below

RESUME HUNSECKER

He is pounding on the door again CAMERA makes a quick pan
to Sidney who in a split second realizes that Susan may
have gone out on the balcony He turns dashes towards the
study to look out on the terrace

RESUME SUSAN

She has now started to climb onto the parapet Sidney leaps
into shot dragging her bodily off the parapet and out of
shot We hear Susan cry out a hysterical gasp CAMERA
looking through the windows of Susans bedroom sees the
door fly open as Hunsecker bursts into the room He looks
swiftly around advances towards the open window
Exasperated by the sound of the gramaphone he switches it
off he steps out onto the terrace CAMERA PANS with him as
he turns to look back into the study where Susans inanimate
figure is sprawled on the floor half across the low
upholstered footstool Sidney white and shaking is
standing over her

lower half of Sidney can be seen beside her Hunsecker is
on the terrace in background Shocked he moves quickly
into the room

HUNSECKER

A CLOSE UP He looks down at his sister He is badly
shaken The sharp bite of terror produces a reaction of
something akin to anger But he swiftly controls it He
moves past CAMERA

REVERSE ANGLE

Hunsecker stoops into shot Tenderly he lifts the girls
body to get it into the arm chair Susan is quite lifeless
limp with the dead weight of a creature that has lost any
instinct for self-preservation But as she feels her
brothers arms and as she recognizes who it is she breaks
out in hysteria

SUSAN
(wildly)
No NO Dont touch me

HUNSECKER
(sharply)
Susan

But Susan strikes at him a vicious gesture of revulsion
Hunsecker lets her go She falls into the arm chair her
face hidden from him she begins to sob

SUSAN
(her body shaking)
Go awayGo away

Hunsecker would like to comfort her but he dare not touch
her again for fear of inviting another rebuff He is deeply
hurt and wounded Embarrassed that Sidney should watch this
moment Hunsecker rises To cover his emotion he walks to
the tray of drinks in background he pours a brandy and
comes back Stooping he offers it to Susan Her only
reaction is again to wrench herself away from him facing
the opposite direction

SUSAN
(sobbing bitterly)
GO AWAY

Hunsecker sets down the drink stands up
HUNSECKER

(in a choked voice)
Talk to her Sidney

SIDNEY
(hushed)
Talk to her yourself

Over scene the telephone rings It is ignored While
Hunsecker looks down at the girl helplessly the telephone
continues to ring

SUSAN

A CLOSE UP It is she who first becomes aware of the
telephone Her weeping has stopped now Slowly she raises
her head CAMERA EASES BACK to include Sidney beyond her

REVERSE ANGLE

Hunsecker comes forward to set down the telephone in front
of her on the footstool Hunsecker and Sidney watch She
reaches a hand which is still trembling picks up the
receiver Her voice as she speaks to the instrument is
barely audible

SUSAN
Yesyesyes

Presently she hangs up When she becomes aware that
Hunsecker and Sidney are waiting for an explanation she
tells them

SUSAN
(speaking with difficulty)
Steveis out of danger
HUNSECKER

Hunsecker nods He already knows this Then

HUNSECKER
(soberly)
That means a lot to you

SUSAN
She does not look at him she lowers her eyes but answers
with a nod And then more positively

SUSAN
Yes

RESUME HUNSECKER

He studies the girl His face has hardened He moves
beginning to pace (And also beginning his manipulations)

HUNSECKER
But I have to warn you Susie - for
your own sake - hell still do
time

CAMERA FOLLOWS Hunsecker It now takes in Sidney who is
standing beside him Sidney has begun to stare fixedly at
Hunsecker (He is now realizing that Hunsecker although he
has been faced with this demonstration of the girls
willingness to kill herself has still learned nothing is
still continuing in the old pattern)

HUNSECKER
(continuing warming
to his theme)
Hes a hop-head - thats a felony
in New York I can try of course
to

SIDNEY
A CLOSE UP Revolted Sidney breaks in
SIDNEY
Youre unholy JJ Youd rather
kill this girl than let her go
GROUP SHOT
Hunsecker wheels on Sidney bellowing
HUNSECKER
(in blind rage)
GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE

Sidney with equal heat spins round to Susan crying out
before he has time to check himself

SIDNEY
(impulsively)
Susie YOU get out of this house -
Get out before its too late

SIDNEY

Sidney has gone too far now to pull back Inevitably he
continues During the speech CAMERA PULLS BACK to include
Susan and then Hunsecker

SIDNEY
(with sincerity)
Listen with care - this will cost
me everything so you know Im
telling you the truth

HUNSECKER
(trying to stop him)
Youre incapable of the truth

SIDNEY

(who will not by stopped)
Susie theres nothing wrong with
Dallas

(turning toward Hunsecker)
Your brother and I arranged it all
And if the Leslie boy is still a
squooshy item in your life forget
it - your brother arranged that
one too I dont usually give
away presents but this is my gift
to you Get out of here Leave
this man

During the latter part of the speech Susan rises slowly to
her feet staring first at Sidney and then with fearful
significance at her brother Hunsecker does not look at
her he is concentrated on Sidney Twice he has been about
to demolish Sidney but he now stops A THOUGHT IN HIS HEAD

HUNSECKER

He is perfectly controlled smiling

HUNSECKER
Like most Italians Sidneys got a
big gift for dramatics I however

prefer the cool and stubborn facts
Sidney has not appeared in my
column in weeks - check that fact
with Mary That leads right to
another fact Sidney had nothing to
lose tonight To the contrary
dear - ONLY HIS OBVIOUS GREED TO
BEAT HIS WAY BACK INTO THE COLUMN
EXPLAINS HIS ACCUSATIONS AGAINST ME
In brief BLACKMAIL

Hunsecker pauses impressively
GROUP SHOT

Framing Hunsecker in foreground Susan and Sidney beyond
Susan listens to Hunsecker objectively with a mounting
sense of his diseased reasoning

HUNSECKER

(continuing)
Mind you not that one true fact
didnt come out of Sidneys mouth
tonight self-admittedly he
committed a vicious crime of
jealousy against Steve Dallas

(pausing)
Now we have to clear Dallas dont
weBut Ill have to sacrifice
him

(he indicates Sidney)
to do it

(turning to Susan)
Am I doing right

Slowly Susan nods
REVERSE ANGLE

SHOOTING ACROSS Susan onto Hunsecker Hunsecker turns away
from her and walks to the telephone He picks it up and
begins to speak While the scene continues we hear his
voice off screen speaking to the phone saying This is
JJ Hunsecker I want you to get a message through to
Lieutenant Kello Ask him to ring me back Its urgent
Susan backs slowly away from Hunsecker Then she turns into
CAMERA which TRACKS with her and includes Sidney Susan
looks at Sidney and then ashamed avoids his eye But
Sidney comes nearer to her Susan is deeply distressed
SUSAN
(very quietly)
Hes sick

She looks again at Sidney Deliberately Sidney nods
Susan walks toward her bedroom

INT BEDROOM

Susan comes into the room finding shelter from the
revelation which has so appalled her Inexorably Sidney
follows her He comes across the threshold closes the door

SIDNEY
(quietly)
Yes hes sick and youre the only
idiot alive who didnt know it

A pause Sidney moves closer to her

SIDNEY
But what are you going to do

There are some tears of pity in Susans eyes Once more she
moves away from Sidney Sidney senses that her compassion
for Hunsecker might easily lead her once again to slip back
into the trap He insists

SIDNEY
(with emphasis)
You dont owe your brother a cup of
water

Another pause Sidney again repeats

SIDNEY
What are you going to do

She moves away from Sidney CAMERA following her After a
moment she answers

SUSAN
Go to Steve

SIDNEY

Sidney is moved having done his solitary act of chivalry
To hide his feelings he is harsh

SIDNEY
(sharply)
For Petes sake straighten out the
seams of your stockings - comb your
hair - dont be so helpless all the
time

CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Susan From the other room we
hear the telephone ring Sidney turns and goes quickly out
After a moment Susan looks back at the door through which
Sidney has disappeared

the window to the street outside where the squad car pulls
ahead to a position ready for him outside the door

(or if he does refuses to recognize it)

HUNSECKER
(with a faint scoff)
Dont kid a kidder Ill see you

Without waiting for a response Hunsecker goes out closing
the door Susan stares at it for a moment Then she moves
to get a small suitcase which she lays on the bed

Hunsecker opens the windows onto the terrace comes out and
looks over the parapet (looking to see how far Sidney has
got hoping to see Kellos squad car)

RESUME SUSAN

She completes her simple packing closing the suitcase
With a gesture that is obviously automatic she starts to
put on the fur coat then she halts realizing what she is
doing She pauses CAMERA MOVES CLOSER Now deliberately
she throws the coat back on the bed CAMERA PANS down with
the gesture She looks down at the coat the discarded
symbol of her dependence upon her brother CAMERA PULLS
BACK again as she takes a quick look round then goes to
take a duffle coat from the wardrobe She throws this over

INT LIVING ROOM

Susan comes out of the door She moves with a sober
determination expecting to find Hunsecker in the room
CAMERA TRACKS with her But then she realizes that Hunsecker
has gone out on the terrace She takes a step or two

towards him then pauses

HUNSECKER

From Susans viewpoint SHOOTING through the big glass
windows Hunsecker is at the parapet He is impatiently
looking down into Broadway

SUSAN

A CLOSE UP She now realizes that there is no point in
saying goodbye to him she has already told him that she is
leaving and if she becomes involved in further argument
with him it can do no good Yet there is some emotion on
her face as she takes a last look at her brother she turns
away

HUNSECKER

Framing him in foreground at the parapet Susan can be seen
through the windows before she disappears to the door
Hunsecker reacts as he catches sight of a vehicle on Broadway

halts

SHOOTING ACROSS Kello onto Sidney Sidneys smile is tired

SIDNEY
I thought he would

KELLO
Yeah
(then)
And another thing - hes gonna say

You know JJ

Sidney turns away to look back towards Phil Then taking
Kello totally by surprise he wheels striking the cop
viciously across the mouth

KELLO

Kellos head jerks back Recovering at once he guffaws
lurches into CAMERA with a sudden vicious movement There
is a sharp guttural cry over scene

LONGER ANGLE

Phil runs forward towards the figures of Sidney and Kello
seen beyond him In doing so he blocks the view so that we
do not clearly see the violence with which Kello strikes
Sidney down Phil in foreground is seen to relax When
he moves aside clearing the view Sidney is writhing on the
ground at Kellos feet

CLOSER ANGLE
Kello wipes his knuckles on his handkerchief He signals to
Phil to help lift the body at his feet Phil enters shot
and they raise Sidney half carrying half dragging him out
of shot

police car can be seen moving off circling the square and
disappearing southward on Broadway CAMERA PULLS BACK to
include Hunsecker in foreground

HUNSECKER

A CLOSE SHOT SHOOTING sharply upward at Hunsecker He
looks down quiet impassively and there is a slightly
insane grandeur a paranoiac superiority in the way that he
turns back dismissing Sidney from his thoughts

INT LIVING ROOM

CAMERA SHOOTS towards the closed door of Susans room
Hunsecker walks into the shot stops before the door He
begins to take off his tie and unbutton his shirt clearly
preparing to go to bed As an after-thought he comes back
to the door addresses it

HUNSECKER
(gently)
Susie
(getting no answer)
Are you in bed

CAMERA MOVES CLOSER It is at a low level still emphasizing
the mans dignity He strolls for a few paces

HUNSECKER
(continuing)
I dont have to tell you of
course that I cleared your
boyfriends name I didnt let you
down

CAMERA has now moved so that we are shooting past Hunsecker
onto Susans door He gets no answer except silence
HUNSECKER

A CLOSE SHOT REVERSE ANGLE We now see in his face a
flicker of fear With what is clearly an effort he
reassumes a confident manner

HUNSECKER
I was saving this news for
breakfast but I think Ill jump
the gun IM GONNA GIVE YOU AND
DALLAS THE BIGGEST WEDDING THIS
TOWN HAS EVER SEEN

Still no answer from inside the bedroom Hunseckers forced
expression remains unnaturally fixed upon his face He
calls out

HUNSECKER

INT BEDROOM

The room is quite empty CAMERA SHOOTS across the bed
towards the door in background Susans discarded fur coat
lies on the bed And the doors of the wardrobe are open
Hunseckers voice can be heard continuing over scene

the ceremony and - NO I think Ill
fly the Governor down from Albany
(a pause)
Do you hear

A pause Then very tentatively the bedroom door is opened
HUNSECKER (0S)
(outside)
Are you listening
Now he opens the door and comes in

HUNSECKER

A BIG CLOSE UP The sight of the empty room freezes his
face for a moment His eyes look round

INT BEDROOM

From Hunseckers viewpoint A PANNING SHOT from the open
door of the cupboard to the fur coat CAMERA PULLS BACK to
include Hunsecker He steps to the bed picks up the coat

REVERSE ANGLE

There is a dazed incredulous look on his face But as he
glances over his shoulder CAMERA ZOOMS PAST him towards a
little door in the wall behind him It is ajar showing a
couple of inches of light

RESUME HUNSECKER

Once again Hunsecker reassures himself that Susan must be
behind the door But his voice is even more false as he
declares

HUNSECKER
(a note of anger
appearing in his voice)
SusieYou wont threaten
meNobody walks out on JJ
Hunsecker
CAMERA NOW MOVES CLOSER and closer to Hunsecker The ANGLE
is a weird one tilting grotesquely upward

HUNSECKER
(continuing)
You need me - you all need me

Hunsecker his fists clenching fiercely at the fur coat
walks towards the door CAMERA PANS with him He stands a
few inches from the narrow opening He seems about to push
the door open further but is afraid to do so

INT BATHROOM

CAMERA SHOOTS ACROSS the bathtub showing enough of the tiny
room to make it clear that it too is completely empty
Through the slit in the door we can see only a glimpse of
the movement of Hunsecker outside Hunseckers voice
continues

HUNSECKER (0S)
The Lord is my Shepherd I shall
not want
(a sneering laugh)
Thats bunk in a book Im the
Shepherd of millions of little men
and women

INT BEDROOM
A DOWNWARD ANGLE SHOOTING past Hunsecker to the door As
Hunsecker retreats from the door he is still clutching the
fur coat He stands alone in the middle of the room and his
gestures are a little wild CAMERA rises higher to shoot
down at Hunsecker alone in the little room

HUNSECKER
(continuing)
I dont ask them to get on their
knees but they come to me for
advice and guidance Who are you
to reject me

With an increasingly eccentric manner Hunsecker strides out
of the bedroom door into the living room again

INT LIVING ROOM

A similar ANGLE SHOOTING down on Hunsecker as he comes out
of the bedroom But as he starts to roam the vast room
CAMERA rises higher still pulling backwards and upwards to
a LONG SHOT which holds the entirety of the big room in all
its ugliness

HUNSECKER
(continuing)
What makes YOU fit to sit in
judgment on a man like me Only a
great person understands another
great person and that leaves you
out

Hunsecker is now addressing the whole of the apartment no
longer pretending even to himself that the girl is still
listening He moves off towards the windows to the terrace
where the curtains are now blowing in the morning wind He
goes out towards the terrace his voice becoming more
distant - a man shouting empty nonsense addressing no one

HUNSECKER
(continuing)
- That leaves you ALL out Youre
pigmies Youre all sick weak
midgets Im proud to be alone

EXT BROADWAY

CAMERA SHOOTS STEEPLY UP towards the top of the Brill Bldg
(At this angle Hunseckers terrace will not be visible but
its position is established in relationship to the Budweiser
sign) CAMERA PANS DOWN to pick up the figure of Susan
Hunsecker as she pushes her way out of the brass doors onto
Broadway
CLOSER ANGLE

Susan pauses on the sidewalk She stays there for a moment
She breathes in the fresh morning air looking around with
the expression of someone who sees the world with new eyes
Then she starts up Broadway - away from the Times Square
area The girls step has a purpose in it she has
confidence and courage Music for the end titles is quiet
simple and lyrical
