Welcome to the jungle
LOST HILLS
FADE IN

A BRIGHT BLUE FLOWER Seven petals round a yellow center
It bobs a little to and fro on a tree branch

Two COMMON FINCHES land on the branch next to the flower
They are PSYCHEDELIC COLORED with black eyes The birds
begin to preen each other

DISSOLVE TO

EXT JUNGLE -- DAY

Dense foliage fills our field of view A nearby shrub
RUSTLES There’s a GRUNT from behind as--

WENDY KEEN (19 for now) untangles herself from the fern

A brunette she has the body of a woman but she still carries
herself like a girl She wears a backpack and cargo shorts
Looks like she’s been hiking for a while now She wipes
sweat from her brow

Something catches her eye and she cocks her head

WENDY
There you are

Wendy stands in the shadow of a GIGANTIC TREE roots flared
wide like wings TWO FIGURES stand at the base surveying

MARTIN KEEN (40s) Wendy’s father turns regards her from
behind his spectacles Martin is a brilliant man his mind
constantly pouring over information while you’re telling him
your life’s story So he can seem a little distracted

MARTIN
Wendy my dear

WENDY
It took me two hours to track after
you guys Just leave me behind and
have all the fun Way to go

Standing beside the tree is PRISCILLA KEEN (40s) Wendy’s
mother She’s got her silver hair tied back wears the
jungle’s grime with elegance A PENDANT glints from around
her neck It’s a CARTOON PENGUIN all smiles

Unlike Wendy the fire in Priscilla’s eyes comes from a
matriarchal place She’s a lioness Priscilla parses out a
length of rope as she kisses her daughter on the forehead
PRISCILLA
We didn’t want to wake you honey

WENDY
You know Id rather be out here

PRISCILLA
Honey it’s dangerous

MARTIN
Were going up You should head
back We’ll see you for lunch

WENDY
That’s not very exciting is it

MARTIN
We’re not fooling around here
Wendy

WENDY

(rolls eyes)
You got any water I’m dying

Priscilla tosses her a fresh bottle Wendy gulps Priscilla
claps her hands final

PRISCILLA
Well Shall we
MARTIN
(glares up)
I don’t know Cil It’s pretty
high up
PRISCILLA

We could use another pair of eyes
Marty Besides you’ve already had
enough of me for the morning

Wendy smiles at Martin who finally nods

WENDY
Yes

Martin quickly removes a white TABLET COMPUTER from his pack
holds it aloft as if he’s trying to find cell phone service
It BLEATS at him and he speaks to it

MARTIN
We’re making our ascent Felix
I’1l radio from the top

Priscilla removes a GRAPPLING GUN from her belt It looks
cobbled together from spare parts She aims the thing--
FISSSHHH--an ANCHOR SPIKE rushes into the top of the tree
Priscilla tugs it to make sure it’s stuck

EXT CANOPY -- MOMENTS LATER

The three ascend along the trunk of the tree with the help of
MOTORIZED CARABINERS that use a simple “push-and-pull” system
on TWO ROPES More of an elevator ride than a climb

Wendy bounces a little in her harness

WENDY
(re the carabiners)
This is nice

MARTIN
It’s Felix’s design Could use
some more power though

WENDY
(mocking)
More power

PRISCILLA
Sure beats the old fashioned way

Priscilla steps onto a branch helps Martin and Wendy up
Martin squints behind his specs

MARTIN
Well I just don’t see it

WENDY
What’re we looking for

MARTIN
A flower When it blooms it’s a
bright blue--
Wendy’s gaze flits to something BEHIND Martin

WENDY
--blue

MARTIN
Bright blue

WENDY
Dad Wrong tree

Martin and Priscilla follow her gaze 30 feet away to
ANOTHER TREE
Growing amongst the foliage is our BRIGHT BLUE FLOWER The

two finches who landed near it earlier take flight from the
branch into the distance

PRISCILLA

Smiles at Martin

MARTIN
Would you look at that

PRISCILLA
She’s your daughter

Priscilla winks at Wendy and unholsters her grappling gun

MOMENTS LATER

Martin clips his motorized carabiner to parallel TRACKS OF
ROPE that SPAN THE DISTANCE between the two trees

MARTIN
(to Wendy)
Well be quick You stay put

He activates his carabiner and it begins to carry him out
across toward the flower Priscilla’s next

WENDY
Ugh I can’t stand it when he talks
to me like that

PRISCILLA
Maybe this time you better listen

Priscilla leans off the branch and moves

ACROSS THE JUNGLE

Away from Wendy She looks down to the forest floor below --
steep drop 80 feet or so

HALFWAY ACROSS the carabiner’s motor makes a WINDING DOWN
noise A wisp of smoke wafts from between the rope as it
crawls to a halt Cil makes a face tries to move hand-over-
hand but the carabiner has her LOCKED in place
PRISCILLA
(beat)
Marty I’m something’s funky
with this

MARTIN

Has made it across the rope and is trying to find his footing
on a branch fixated on the flower that’s just out of reach
Priscilla’s cries fall on deaf ears She turns to

WENDY

Who silently nods clips herself onto the same rope zips out
across toward her mother and tries to ignore the heights

Once she reaches Priscilla she grabs for her and doesn’t
notice that the “pull” rope FRAYS ever so slightly

PRISCILLA
Coupling’s fried Switch it for
another okay It’1ll be fine

Wendy steadily clips herself in between the push-and-pull
ropes--TWANG--makes the rope Cil’s on fray a little more
She goes wide-eyed speechless

Wendy works swiftly a bead of sweat runs down her nose as
every movement makes the rope Priscilla’s on fray even
more Priscilla glares up grips for a handhold

PRISCILLA (CONTD)
Baby it’s not going to hold

WENDY
It’1ll hold

Wendy reaches to clip the final latch closed sees that the
rope is down to ONE STRAND--
MARTIN

Climbs to a higher branch reaches for the flower brushes it
with his fingertips

Behind him Priscilla and Wendy silently FALL out of frame

Martin plucks the flower by the stem turns to triumphantly
meet Priscilla on the line -- but she’s GONE
WENDY

Flies through the air the WIND the only sound as she drops
like a stone It’s a VERTIGO effect everything warps and
rushes up to meet her Instant death--

The rope she’s attached to--THWACK--is pulled taut five feet
before impact Blood rapidly rushes to her head

Priscilla lies unmoving on the ground below her

MARTIN
Scurries out across the remaining rope

The second carabiner Wendy dangles from works as a
DECELERATOR servos WHIR Martin looks down mortified by
what he sees

SMASH TO

MEN in medical SCRUBS hover over us Fluorescents FLARE our
vision and an unsteady BEEPING crescendoes

EXT MEDICAL SUITE -- LATER

Wendy ambles down a hallway of exposed sheetrock with a
thousand-yard stare She comes to a corner where she can spy
a CLOSED DOOR Martin hurriedly exits with ANOTHER MAN

They both wear medical scrubs

As the second man strips the latex gloves from his hands the
mask from his face we meet FELIX TREMAIN (30s) Martin’s
assistant and right-hand man by way of Liverpool Felix is
wire-thin with piercing eyes and a mustache He speaks with
a watered-down English accent Wendy listens from afar

MARTIN
That’s internal bleeding Shes
right we can’t do anything more
for her here
(off Felix’s silence)
I’m going to call in an airlift to
the mainland--

Martin moves past Felix who grabs his arm

FELIX
Wait Just wait
(beat)
We found it Martin
MARTIN
Felix my wife is in there

FELIX
They’11 shut us down for this
What have you both been working for
all this time
(beat)
I can keep her alive

Wendy makes a noise alerts the two men

WENDY
Dad Is Mom alright

MARTIN
(all smiles)
Wendy Come here

Martin embraces her eyes Felix over her shoulder Felix
crosses his arms

DISSOLVE TO

INT MEDICAL SUITE -- LATER

Priscilla sits feebly upright in a hospital bed Her hair is
matted with sweat she looks frail and gaunt Priscilla
wakes as Wendy and Martin enter

PRISCILLA
Everyone’s here I’m glad

WENDY
(through tears)
Mom I’m so sorry I let you fall

Priscilla meekly takes Wendy’s face in her hands
PRISCILLA
No no You did everything right
My sweet Wendy Don’t ever doubt
yourself Not for a second

Priscilla turns to Martin expectantly

PRISCILLA (CONTD)
Did you find it

Martin removes the BLUE FLOWER from his pocket wilted
Priscilla smiles and sighs a deep resigned sigh
PRISCILLA (CONT’D)
Don’t lose focus now Marty
That’s all that matters

WENDY
Youre all that matters Mom
PRISCILLA
That’s sweet
(to Martin)

She’s sweet
Wendy nods Priscilla’s eyes grow heavy

WENDY
Mom I--

Priscilla’s heart monitor’s BEEPS become erratic and her
eyes grow heavy Wendy backs away from the hospital bed as
Felix rushes in with a CRASH CART Priscilla has FLATLINED

Wendy hugs herself in the corner as Felix and Martin work
furiously the monotone BEEEEEEEEP all we hear Finally
Felix shuts the monitor off as Martin clasps Priscilla’s

hands over her heart

Felix and Martin watch Wendy take off through the hallway
with tears streaming down her face Felix puts his hand on
Martin’s shoulder as we

SMASH TO

EXT JUNGLE -- MOMENTS LATER

Wendy’s footsteps pound the ground her hair a mess She
comes to the tree Priscilla fell from and stops running
exhausted every bit of her strength gone

She notices her mother’s PENGUIN PENDANT coiled in the mud
She picks it up as rain INSTANTLY begins falling around her
like someone turned on a shower head Her tears mix with the
falling rain

She kneels SOBBING and we PULL BACK to reveal the metal
girders of a CONSTRUCTION CRANE then ANOTHER in the far
distance Wendy isn’t standing in a clearing in the jungle
anymore

As our eyes adjust we see the ground DROPS OFF trees give
way to a man-made CEMENT SUBSTRUCTURE below Wendy is
dwarfed by whatever this work-in-progress is as we

DISSOLVE TO
INT MARTIN’S STUDY -- LATER

Martin enters and removes his lab coat Something catches
his eye There on his desk sits Priscilla’s PENDANT

He looks around for a moment hangs his head as we
FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN

EXT COLORADO RIVER -- DAY

Roaring RAPIDS thrash the river From around a craggy rock
speeds an INFLATABLE RAFT filled with SIX PASSENGERS and--

Wendy (late 20s now) who sits in the center of the raft
rowing double oars to steer She shouts COMMANDS

WENDY
Alright people This is it The
last class four before we go home
You ready

PASSENGERS
Yeah Bring itLet’s do this

TWO FRAT DUDES on the left side of the raft high-five each
other begin to paddle furiously

WENDY
Weve got to build up speed in
order to push through this
hydraulic or we’re gonna dump
truck So paddle Now

Everyone paddles furiously with their oars Wendy grits her
teeth as they bob down and enter the rapids

WENDY (CONT’D)
More More speed

The Frat Dudes snicker at Wendy and pump their arms faster

The raft rattles as it becomes LODGED in the churning
whitewater

The left side begins to slowly lift over their heads

WENDY (CONTD)
To the high side Stay low

The Frat Dudes freak and STAND STRAIGHT UP Wendy goes wide-
eyed as they’re LAUNCHED from the raft and into the rapids

She scrambles grabs one of them by his life jacket as he
spins beside He crawls into the raft

But his buddy swirls further down stream He SCREAMS for
help careens right toward a jagged SHARD OF ROCK

Wendy grabs a THROW BAG from under her seat as the rest of
the passengers dig their way out of the rapids She plays
out a meter of rope from the bag clips it inside the raft

She cranes her neck spies Frat Dude in the water and waves
the orange bag at him He raises his arms in response

Wendy tosses the bag It flies through the air parses out
the rope within and lands a few meters downstream from the
Frat Dude He grabs the bag inches from the rock--

Wendy YANKS the rope from the raft pulls with all her might
and reels him in HAND OVER HAND As the Frat Dude helps his
buddy out of the water the shard of rock NICKS the raft

FRAT DUDE
Dude Dude

Wendy notices small TEAR in the raft She continues to
paddle downstream where the rapids lead to calmer waters

EXT RIVER BANK -- LATER
The passengers mill about their life vests hang open

We get a good look at Wendy as she stands by the water
Older wiser a grown woman now She’s still wound tight
only confident more FOCUSED She emphatically ties a knot
as the Frat Dude she saved approaches

FRAT DUDE
Hey I just wanted to say thanks
Again
(beat grave)
Seriously I was gonna be
skewered and you saved my life

Wendy tucks her hair behind her ear bashful
WENDY

Don’t sweat it Comes with the
territory

A car horn BLEATS at her as a 4x4 crests the ridge Painted
on the side Westward River Expeditions Est 2007 Wendy
smiles goes to approach remembers something She reaches
into her pocket and slips on a modest ENGAGEMENT RING

ALAN HARMON (30s) steps out of the truck and watches Wendy
climb up the bank toward him Alan wears glasses skinny as
a rail Wendy’s fiance

ALAN
Ahoy How was the run

WENDY
Couple of bumps but we made it

ALAN
Couple of bumps
(re the passengers)
Couldn’t have ditched a few of ‘em
over Beaver Falls

WENDY
I was feeling generous

ALAN
That’s my girl

Alan puts his arm around Wendy kisses on her lips

INT ALAN’S TRUCK -- MOMENTS LATER
Wendy rides shotgun The raft bobs down over the windshield

ALAN
I figure if we land a few more
runs before fall we’ll be golden
Hmm Take some time off

WENDY
Alan it’s the height of the
season

ALAN

Babe I know

WENDY
So what do you want time off for

ALAN
I thought we’d have ourselves an
old fashioned Grand Canyon weddin’

WENDY
I don’t know

ALAN
That’s what you said when I
suggested Montana

WENDY
I said “no” to Montana right away

ALAN
Okay so what’s wrong with the
Canyon You love it there

WENDY
I’1l think about it

ALAN
Parents say that when they mean
“no” We ever going to have a

serious conversation about this
WENDY
(beat)
I’1l think about it
He taps the brakes as they pull into a dusty PARKING LOT
ALAN
Whose truck is that

EXT WESTWARD RIVER EXPEDITIONS -- MOMENTS LATER

Parked in front of the main office of Westward River
Expeditions is a WHITE TRUCK

Wendy marches up to it but there’s nobody inside

FELIX (0OS)
Wendy Keen A proper grown up

Wendy spins to see Felix sitting in a wicker rocking chair on
the front porch of the cabin He stands moves to where she
can see him better He’s aged well grey at the ears

WENDY
Felix

Alan comes jogging up beside Wendy

ALAN
(always the salesman)
Hi there Looking for the
adventure of a lifetime

FELIX
I’ve had my share thank you--

WENDY
Felix this is Alan My fiance

ALAN
Oh you know Wendy

Felix descends from the porch

FELIX
Since she was a little sprite
You’re a tough cookie to find
(beat)
Alan you keep up with her

ALAN
Wendy runs the rapids I’ve got
dry land duty right Hon

WENDY
Felix what’s this about

FELIX
Is there somewhere we can talk

Wendy shoots Alan a grave look

INT WESTWARD RIVER EXPEDITIONS -- MOMENTS LATER

Felix eyes the rustic decorations A large map of the
Colorado River on the far wall pamphlets scattered about
antique oars crossed over the fireplace

ALAN
I can wrangle up a cup of coffee
if you like

FELIX

Id love some
Alan nods exits to another room Wendy pulls up a chair

FELIX (CONTD)
(beat)
Wendy when was the last time you
spoke with your father

WENDY
The day I left

Felix raises his eyebrows and looks away

FELIX
He always thought you’d come back

WENDY
Oblivious

FELIX
After Priscilla passed your father
became rather unpredictable
Maybe you didn’t realize this when
you were younger but the lilypad
doesn’t pay for itself Quest
Logistics stepped in as financiers
when all the grants dried up
Unlimited capital in exchange for
the patents on everything to come
out of that jungle More recently
they’ve started putting in
requests
(long beat)
Wendy three days ago Quest lost
track of Martin

WENDY

They what

FELIX
He’s disappeared inside Lost Hills

WENDY
So Jesus get some researchers in
there and find him--

FELIX

He’s shut us out unfortunately
Well first he fired most everyone
That or they quit The day I
tendered my resignation I was the
last one to go

WENDY
You left him there alone

FELIX
Let’s not go pointing fingers at
who left where
(off her stare)
I’m afraid he’s gone and well
frankly that his life’s in danger

Alan comes back with the coffee

FELIX (CONT’D)
I know Martin left the door open
for you He always said that

WENDY
If he wants to rot alone in there
that’s his business Not mine

FELIX
I implore you now before you lose
another member of your family see
the gravity in this Without
Martin Lost Hills Research Center
will be no more It was your
parents’ dream

WENDY
Don’t you put that on me Felix

Felix sees she’s finished He leaves Wendy a card

FELIX
My contact Quest Logistics is
permitting me twenty-four hours
Then they take drastic measures
(beat stands)
A pleasure meeting you Alan

Felix exits Wendy stares down at the floor

EXT WESTWARD RIVER EXPEDITIONS -- LATER

Wendy and Alan remove the raft from the top of his 4x4 as the
sun sets behind them Wendy watches Alan work silently

He runs a brush soaked in Bubble solution over a section of
the raft presses down on the side--HISSSS--a bubble gurgles
from the urethane inflatable He looks to Wendy

ALAN
(beat)
I think you should go I really
do You say things in your sleep
Sometimes it wakes me up and--

WENDY
Alan I don’t need you to play
Devil’s Advocate Not now

Alan reaches for a bottle of Stay-Bond Adhesive

ALAN
It’s just you talk about your dad
like he’s already dead

WENDY
He might as well be

ALAN
(beat)
You say that now But one day

Wendy doesn’t answer instead walks back toward the office
with her head down

Alan flattens the section of leaky raft and spreads the gook
over the hole Then he places a 4x6 plastic patch on top
As he waits for it to dry and watches the sun set we

EXT JUNGLE -- DAY (WENDYS DREAM)

Wendy stands in the highest boughs of a tree overlooking the
jungle from the prologue MARTIN is out on the line His
decelerator is stuck like Priscillas

Wendy furiously tries to make her way out to help him

Shes privy to the SHREDDED ROPE every movement makes it
fray STRAND BY STRAND until

Martin is frozen in a SLOW-MOTION scream as the rope--TWANG--
snaps and the drop down is WARPED Wendys vision BLURRY as
he plummets everything rushing up to meet him

Instant death--

WENDY

a lot of catching up to do And if

He ducks for cover behind the log turns back to see--

ARIANNA CRUZ (30s) who falls in next to him Cruz is a
lanky olive-skinned Venus Hair pulled back laser eyes

Since we last saw him Dr Keen has developed a NERVOUS TICK
He blinks his eyes and purses his lips constantly

MARTIN
This is Marty Keen It’s July
the fourteenth and I’m now
officially the last employee of
Lost Hills Research Center

WENDY
Averts her eyes

WENDY
He looks so old

ON SCREEN
ERRR--the image jumps Martin stands further from the camera

MARTIN

And I told him if he couldn’t prove
to me that he wasn’t the one
pilfering the lab’s supply closet--

(ERRR--last distortion)
I’m going to solve this riddle at
last It’s peaceful here Quiet
I can think finally

Martin reaches forward and the screen goes BLANK

FELIX
Crosses his arms

FELIX
Well the important question is
where did he go

WES
(typing)
That shouldn’t be too hard

YARI
Get outta here dude

Yari moves to the terminal next to Wes begins furiously
typing in speed with his brother

WES
Slow down you’re going to--
(off Yari’s GRUNT)
--there’s a security protocol--

KER-KLUNK All the screens FLASH Unauthorized Zenith

Whoops

FELIX
What do you mean “whoops”

YARI
Minor setback

WES
You troll That’s not a minor
setback We’re going to have to
reset the whole processor core

FELIX
How long

WES
On this beast

Wendy HUFFS promptly storms out of the control room Felix
shoots the brothers a look

DISSOLVE TO

INT MARTIN’S STUDY -- DAY

Alan stands looking at a BUST OF ALBERT EINSTEIN Hanging
around his neck is a GOLD MEDALLION Alan’s eyes light up

ALAN
Omygod This is his Nobel Prize

Wendy rifles through drawers in Martin’s desk amidst the
clutter of his study The place is warm a Man-Cave where
microscopes sub in for electric guitars

WENDY
(re the bust)
He thought old ‘Bert got shafted
since he was never recognized for
Relativity He dedicated it to him

Alan peruses more memorabilia -- photos of Martin shaking
hands with STEVE JOBS with HILARY CLINTON

ALAN
You know your dad’s nothing to be
embarrassed about

WENDY
I was never embarrassed Alan
Dad’s a wonderful scientist
He’s just really shitty at caring
about anything else

Wendy finds a tin box at the bottom of the drawer
She shakes it -- something RATTLES inside A KEY Wendy
stands with it moves to a LOCKBOX across

Wendy opens it and removes a KEY CARD crosses again toward
an OIL PAINTING of TWO GORILLAS Alan watches mesmerized

She removes the painting from the wall reveals a safe that
eats the key card Wendy opens the safe and removes TWO MORE
LASER-CUT KEYS

ALAN
Jesus how many keys is that

WENDY
He’s very meticulous Here help

She shows Alan to TWO SLOTS on the bookshelf behind them
They insert their keys

KLUNK The bookshelf SWINGS OPEN reveals a hidden ROOM
Wendy leads Alan inside

MARTIN’S WARDROBE

His private stash of stuff There are LAB COATS hanging
stacks of FRAMED PATENTS a MIRROR that reads TIME Man of
The Year across the glass

Wendy reaches for Priscilla’s PENGUIN PENDANT It hangs
over Martin’s TABLET COMPUTER cradled in a docking station

Wendy drapes the necklace around her neck as the tablet--
BLEEP--restarts Screen reads Good Afternoon Dr Keen

Wendy grabs the thing begins scrolling through it
WENDY
Bingo
INT LOST HILLS -- ATRIUM -- MOMENTS LATER

Felix points as Steady and Cruz heft more cases through the
airlock Wendy and Alan come jogging in

WENDY
He’s in the habitat

FELIX
How do you know that

Wendy shows the tablet to Felix

WENDY
(scrolls through)
I found his lab notes

FELIX
You really are your father’s
daughter
(to the group)
Move everything into the labs
well bed down there for now

STEADY
(hefts a case)
Everything

Wendy takes Alan’s arm

WENDY
You gotta see this

INT PRIMARY LABORATORY -- MOMENTS LATER

Felix mashes a button next to an access door marked PRIMARY
LAB FACILITY PERSONNEL ONLY The door opens and Wendy
Alan Felix Dreyfuss Steady and Cruz file into the CONE-
SHAPED research facility with all their supplies

A mess of wires and cables snake from the four-story high
concave ceiling and down to different WORK STATIONS

At the center of it all is an OVEN-SIZED CHAMBER bolted to
the lab floor Wendy stands beside it with Alan

WENDY
The Nano-Accelerator Chalk
everything up to this Dad’s
telegraph His light bulb

Wendy moves to a WORKSTATION where a glass canister stands
upright She lifts it to the light examines a SEED POD
floating in a CLEAR SOLUTION inside

Wendy dons a pair of gloves and places the canister inside
the vault-like kiln Wendy seals the oven and mashes a RED
BUTTON on the side the chamber begins to do its “thing”

Sounds like a JET ENGINE revving up YELLOW LIGHT seeps out
from the edges of the door as the sound CRESCENDOES

Wendy pops the kiln open and removes the canister with a pair
of tongs The previously clear solution is CLOUDY metallic
The seed pods are awash with it

ALAN
Kind of a microwave oven
on steroids

Wendy carefully sets the canister down on a conveyor belt
It’s WHISKED AWAY through a sealed passage Felix smiles
Everyone else is mesmerized

FELIX
(to Wendy)
Go on Open her up

Everyone moves to a larger set of doors marked SECONDARY
LAB PLEASE REMEMBER TO DECONTAMINATE

The double doors SWING OPEN and our tour enters

THE SECONDARY LAB

FIVE TIMES the size as the first A FOREST in the making
Entire trees are CROSS-SECTIONED affixed with PROBES The
effect is an overwhelming melding of nature and machine The
CHAMBER rises 10 STORIES something akin to a missile silo

They file down a CATWALK that hangs twenty feet over the soil
floor of the lab

STEADY
These trees are over three hundred
years old How

Felix sighs quickly moves to an OBSERVATION PANEL It’s a
readout of all the specimens in the lab

FELIX
Were able to grow viable specimens
in as little as six months
(re the panel)
Hello my darlings Good to see
that everyone’s still growing

ALAN
(points)
What’s down there

The catwalk continues across the laboratory to an even larger
set of HANGAR DOORS marked TERTIARY LAB NO ADMITTANCE

WENDY
Moms lab

Wendy says no more her eyes wander to another catwalk
perpendicular TENTED OFF with sheets of plastic

INT VEGETATION TENT -- MOMENTS LATER

A bright hothouse with a MOUND OF DIRT at the center
Planted in the soil are three of the BLUE FLOWERS we’ve seen
Each in various stages of DECAY

Three OCTANGULAR CELLS made of opaque glass blast light
onto them Wendy kneels before the flowers

FELIX
Martin’s passion project Cielo
Azul They’re shy buggers

CRUZ
Means “blue skies”
(of Felix’s nod)
What’s so special

FELIX

We know they reverse the growth of
malignant neoplasms

(off blank stares)
They cure cancer Martin thought
there were other possibilities a
genetically engineered flower of
youth

Dreyfuss kneels snaps some shots

WENDY
Photosynthates still giving him
trouble

FELIX

I wouldn’t know He locked me out
of the project I know he couldn’t
cultivate enough for a viable
compound however You’d need a
field-full

DREYFUSS
You lost me back at “cure for
cancer”

ALAN
Yeah how can you be sure

WENDY
Luke and Leia They eat the
flower
(a light bulb)
Felix They’1ll know where Dad is

Wendy dashes back out of the tent

INT SECONDARY LAB -- MOMENTS LATER
Wendy shouts orders as everyone files out after her

WENDY
Gear up We’ll need extra water
And energy bars--

FELIX
--Wendy--

WENDY
--Alan those shoes won’t cut it--

FELIX
Wendy That won’t be necessary

Wendy puts her hands on her hips as Felix moves to a control
panel beside a portion of the catwalk that ENDS abruptly
Something goes there

Felix accesses a screen reads ENGAGE VIEWPOD YN Felix
selects Y The wall opposite REVOLVES

THE VIEWPOD

Emerges from a docking bay It’s an enclosed glass capsule
15 feet across Once sleek now run down like everything
else here Rust seeps from the rivets

The machinery that powers it reminds us of the DECELERATOR
Wendy jimmied in the prologue only larger and more complex

The viewpod rotates toward them on a SKI-LIFT mechanism
A metal bulkhead door opens like a mouth

WENDY

Hesitates chews her lip

FELIX
Going up

WENDY
I’m not getting in that thing

FELIX
That’s a few hours hike The
viewpod is perfectly safe

INT VIEWPOD -- MOMENTS LATER

Standing room only Leather straps hang along the rim for
support More of a subway car than anything else

Felix pilots at a simple set of controls mashes a button
that closes the door

FELIX
Kneecaps and elbows

He winks at Alan who regards Wendy clutching her arms to her
chest The whole thing JOLTS as they begin to move up

The glass bubble speeds through the highest reaches of the
lab and through a BRIGHT CREVICE in the ceiling into

THE HABITAT

Where everything is OVEREXPOSED for a moment Alan shades
his eyes to see as they continue to ascend

EXT VIEWPOD -- SAME

The viewpod acts like a giant PRIZEBOX CLAW that can lower
down anywhere inside the habitat It speeds along the
SURFACE of “sky” beneath the dome made of the same OCTAGONAL
CELLS from the lab all tuned to DAYLIGHT

Below us 16 square miles of LANDSCAPE grown in a lab

INT VIEWPOD -- SAME

Wendy grips her leather strap averts her eyes Problem is
everywhere she looks she SEES DOWN She flares her
nostrils Sweat beads on her forehead

ALAN
(re the view)
This is This is Wendy
This is amazing
(notices Wendy trembling)
Hon You’re shaking

Alan grabs her hand loosens her death grip on the strap
ALAN (CONTD)

That’s it Tell me what the hell
I’m looking at cuz I have no idea

THROUGH THE VIEWSHIELD
The viewpod careens over A DESERT LANDSCAPE

WENDY (0S)
(breathless)

It’s half desert half jungle

Highlands and lowlands Split

down the middle--

Wendy GASPS as the whole vista DROPS OUT from underneath us
to reveal the JUNGLE below

A WATERFALL springs from AN OASIS on the edge of the cliff

and spills down into an ARTIFICIAL RIVER that meanders
through the trees

ALAN

Rubs Wendy’s back as Steady and Cruz press their faces to the
glass wide-eyed at it all Dreyfuss shoots frames

FELIX
Almost there

EXT VIEWPOD -- SAME
The bubble GRINDS to a stop above the jungle sways in place
After a moment it begins to DESCEND toward the forest floor

INT VIEWPOD -- SAME

Wendy braces herself squeezes her eyes closed as the pod
touches down with a RUMBLE

Wendy finally EXHALES opens one eye then the other
Steady Cruz and Felix have already exited the viewpod
Alan pries Wendy’s hand from his own

ALAN
(beat)
Okay I need that hand

EXT BANYAN TREE -- MOMENTS LATER
Everyone stretches their legs Felix points through the

jungle to a BANYAN TREE the width of a city block Alan
gesticulates in the middle of an anecdote
ALAN

(scoffs)
It’s a really boring story

(oh alright)
Environmental Science graduate
program at New Mexico New Student
mixer couple of margaritas Love
at first sight etcetera

CRUZ
Absolutely Fascinating

ALAN
How ‘bout you two Married

STEADY
Hey I got her the rock

CRUZ
And I didn’t say “no” Exactly

Steady grabs Cruz on the ass Cruz slaps his wrist

CRUZ (CONTD)
Ay Dios

STEADY
Talk ethnic to me baby
(laughs it off)
What are we looking for here

WENDY
Two of them You’re going to want
to announce your presence vocally
before treading their territory

STEADY
(screams to the tree)
I’m announcing my presence
(back to Wendy)
Like that--

Suddenly Steady is GONE in a BLUR OF FUR Cruz looks into

the boughs of the Banyan tree and SCREAMS

Two MASSIVE SILVERBACK GORILLAS hold Steady hostage

Their

eyes GLINT in the semi-shade the creatures seconds from

tearing his head from his neck Steady MOANS--

WENDY
(top of her lungs)

Staaaahhp

Wendy makes QUICK MOTIONS with her hands yells again

WENDY (CONTD)
Put him down

The gorillas narrow their eyes and release Steady He lands
on his feet immediately rolls out from under the branches
and draws his knife--

The gorillas SWING down from the boughs Built like brick
shit houses the female smaller than the male Black fur
dappled with silver spots and stripes The same ones from
Martin’s OIL PAINTING

One of them ROARS a mighty roar as Wendy sprints between

WENDY (CONTD)
(through gritted teeth)
Steady drop the knife

She makes more furious HAND SIGNALS and we realize
Wendy’s talking in SIGN LANGUAGE to the gorillas She slowly
approaches and the two gorillas EMBRACE her

STEADY
(sheathes his knife)
Regular Jane of the jungle

WENDY
Guys meet Luke and Leia
(beat)
Dad wanted to go with Adam and Eve
but I’ve always had a soft spot for
Star Wars

One of the gorillas tustles Wendy’s hair she laughs

LATER

The light has changed beneath the banyan where Wendy and Alan
sit with the gorillas Felix Steady Dreyfuss and Cruz hang
back wait for Wendy to do her thing

Wendy speaks to Luke and Leia in sign language SUBTITLED for
our convenience

WENDY
I missed you two So much

LEIA
Luke had given up on you I never
did and I never will Girl power

LUKE
Oh please

Alan frowns at Wendy

ALAN
You know sign language

WENDY
Only a little
(whoops aloud)
Only a little
(to the gorillas)
This is Alan We are mates

LUKE
(snorts )
That is funny I am laughing

WENDY
You can say hello Like this

Alan copies Wendy’s sign The gorillas return it

ALAN
Ha

WENDY
Leia got really sick when I was
little and Dad thought he’d need
to put her down When we got back
to the lab the scans showed her
tumor had shrunk from like a
basketball to a pea That’s when
dad found his power flower

Dreyfuss’ camera WHIRS from across the clearing distracting

LETA
I wish he would stop that

WENDY
(to Dreyfuss)
Cut it out
Dreyfuss stops quietly backs away Wendy turns to Luke

WENDY (CONTD)
Felix and I are looking for Martin

LUKE
Are they still in a fight

LETA

(off Wendy’s frown)
Oh yes
(MORE )

LEIA (CONTD)
They had a great fight and then
Martin walked into the trees

WENDY
Do you know where Dad is

Something unspoken passes between them Leia nods to Luke

LUKE
He is where they go two by two

WENDY
(beat frowns)
Why

LUKE
We do not know why We were not
supposed to say where

LEIA
Unless it is Wendy

LUKE
We trust Wendy

WENDY
It doesn’t make sense

Luke suddenly stands puffs his chest He looks across to
where the others stand

LEIA
It is not safe here

GREEN FOLIAGE

Rustles behind Felix Everyone turns holds their breath and
backs away from the sound After a moment the rustling
stops and--

A multi-colored goat BLEATS at them meanders out of the
shrubs and munches on some leaves

CRUZ
Awww

Cruz reaches out pats the thing on the head Felix leans in
closer catches something SILVERY further in the foliage

FELIX
(grave)
Everyone back into the viewpod

INT VIEWPOD -- MOMENTS LATER

Everyone hurries into the viewpod Wendy and Alan pick up
the rear as Luke and Leia climb up into the tree

WENDY
What is it The gorillas were
freaked

FELIX
(sotto)
And they should be--
Felix GASPS his gaze flits to the far end of the viewpod
A pair of YELLOW EYES blink at him Then they VANISH below
the pod’s rim

As Alan scrambles into the viewpod something SNAGS his leg
from below the ladder

ALAN
Aaaaaaaaaaaaahh

Alan GRIPS the doorway and uses his free leg to KICK back
Whatever’s got him lets out a BIZARRE SCREECH and releases
The calf of his jeans is shredded

Felix scrambles for the controls but the whole viewpod ROCKS
sideways on the cable and everyone is thrown to the floor
The controls FLASH RED

EXT VIEWPOD -- SAME

We can’t see what’s attacking but one of the decelerators
SPARKS knocked off its track as the pod is jostled

The viewpod ASCENDS on its own--

INT VIEWPOD -- SAME

Wendy reacts to the UPWARD motion and stands breathless with
another panic attack She glares

THROUGH THE VIEWSHIELD

The goats scatter THREE SILVER SHAPES grow smaller as they
slink after the herd deeper into the foliage below

FELIX

Jiggers the joystick to no avail

FELIX
We’re on autopilot back to the lab
(SLAMS his fist)
Bloody hell

WENDY
Whad’ya mean “autopilot”

The whole pod SHUDDERS as they rise higher

Wendy backs away from the plexi-glass squeezes her eyes--
KRAM The viewpod JERKS to a stop and throws everyone to the
ground again The door SNAPS OPEN and Wendy is tossed--
EXT VIEWPOD -- SAME

Wendy is THROWN FROM pod and tumbles down the open plank

She clings to the second-to-last step white-knuckled The
decelerator makes a WINDING-DOWN noise as the viewpod comes

to rest at an awkward angle PARTIALLY DESCENDED

Wendy kicks her legs furiously and tries to scramble back
inside as the pod LURCHES forward toward the laboratory

Wendy’s grip slips with every lopsided bob down to the
edge of the door--
ALAN

Grabs the collar of her shirt and pulls her back

INT VIEWPOD -- SAME

Where she lands on top of him They smile relieved
Dreyfuss slowly stands behind everyone and points--
THROUGH THE VIEWSHIELD

Where the CLIFF-FACE rapidly approaches With the pod
hanging low like it is--

FELIX

Goes wide-eyed

FELIX
Brace yourselves

EXT VIEWPOD -- SAME

The pod COLLIDES with the cliff-face and swings off course
like a yo-yo It careens through the air and--WHOMP--sends
up a cloud of sand

The pod carves a ditch as it’s dragged across the desert like
a torpedo exposes cement girders below

INT VIEWPOD -- SAME

Wendy and Alan grab each other as the cylinder careens toward
a massive BOULDER--WHAM--everything goes BLACK inside

EXT HIGHLANDS -- SAME

The pod has UPENDED shorn right through a FALSE BOULDER
revealing an aluminum husk The decelerators SPARK AND POP
the thing has SEVERED from the cable overhead It’s totaled

Steady throws himself out onto the sand chuckles Then he
pokes his head back in

STEADY
Cruz You in one piece

A hand extends out of the viewpod Steady pulls Cruz free as
she coughs UNINTELLIGIBLE SPANISH

STEADY (CONTD)
Ill assume that means “yes”

MOMENTS LATER
Steady helps Dreyfuss the last of them out of the viewpod

They’ve settled on a desert landscape with catci and more
artificial rocks that dot the horizon Felix massages his
neck as Wendy stands

WENDY
What the hell just did that

FELIX
Panthera Sphyraena Jungle cat
with a twist They hunt the goats
fixate on the viewpod like a toy

(re the viewpod)
Just let me think for a moment

Wendy removes the tablet computer scrolls through

WENDY
We can still make it

FELIX
(hikes his thumb)
Can’t call a tow truck exactly

ALAN
If you can get me back to the labs
I could take a look Just point me
in the direction of a toolbox

FELIX
That’1l take hours

WENDY
Which is why we’re going On foot

Steady and Cruz perk up Felix shakes his head “no”

FELIX
Have you gone barmy The sun is
about to set We do not want to be
in here when that happens You
really have no idea--

WENDY
Don’t you tell me what I know and
what I don’t Felix

Felix shuts up Steady cuts the tension

STEADY
We got the gear Couldn’t hurt if
we stay in radio contact

WENDY
(to Felix)
There That’s settled

Behind her Steady kicks open a hole in the glass viewpod
Their supply cases come TUMBLING out

Steady unlatches one and begins rifling through He hands
Felix Dreyfuss and Cruz Kevlar SAFARI VESTS with EARPIECES
that plug in through the shoulder

A SPARK OF LIGHT alerts Alan Steady hands Felix A STUN
WAND has one himself They tuck them into their belts

ALAN

EXT HIGHLANDS -- MOMENTS LATER
A BOULDER splits down the middle--HISSSS--decompresses and
reveals the inside of an airlock like a coffin Wendy

scrolls through the tablet as Alan steps inside

Something WHIPS out of the semi-darkness and SUCKS the light
out of her hand It skitters across the sand and points
directly at our backpackers BLINDING THEM

Cruz covers her eyes and marches into the light bends to
retrieve it but it’s covered in opaque STRANDS

Wendy DIVES onto the flashlight as the ground behind her
snaps up and she comes face to face with an ARACHNOPOD--
a spider the size of a Golden Retriever but not nearly
as affectionate

She screams and KICKS the thing in the eyes sends it
SKITTERING back into its hole

Wendy finally gets her fingers around the torch Horrific
SCREECHES echo from inside THE NEST as Wendy finally CLICKS
the power cord into the battery pack--

It RECOILS its exoskeleton SMOKES AND POPS allergic to the

It lies still a bubbling oozing mess in the sand
Wendy smiles to herself--

Her smile quickly fades as the sand begins to CHURN all
around The ground COLLAPSES and Wendy falls into

THE NEST

A system of TUNNELS beneath the surface lined with a lattice
work of webbing

Wendy shines the light down one end and spots an Arachnopod
scurry around a corner dragging Cruz’s LIFELESS BODY Wendy
storms after it and--SQUISH--steps on an EGG CASING

Teeny Arachnopods scurry beneath her feet and away from the
light down the tunnel

A DUSTING of sand from behind her Wendy SNAPS the light
around Nothing She HYPERVENTILATES as FOUR MORE SPIDERS
descend from above They freak Wendy and she BLINDS THEM
with the light--

One SLASHES the flashlight out of her hands--YANK--the light
GOES DEAD again as the power cord is severed Wendy dives
down onto the floor of the nest and plays possum

The blind Arachnopods scurry around her and begin slowly
searching the nest for their prey one segmented leg at
a time

Wendy INHALES as they aimlessly fondle her face and brush
against her arms Her stillness camouflages her but she
can’t hold her breath any longer and EXHALES--

The spiders stop in their tracks and CHITTER to one another
They slowly skitter back over her body

Wendy grips a rock and tosses it back down the tunnel where
it SPLATTERS another egg sack The four spiders let out
WARNING SCREECHES and scurry that way--

Everyone shields their eyes for a moment as the SQUEALS of
the Arachnopods fill their ears The creatures SIZZLE and
POP on the sand Everyone gasps for air

Steady begins digging with his bare hands in the spot where
Cruz vanished Ferocious until Wendy stops him

WENDY (CONTD)
You did everything you could
James

Steady marches toward one of the Arachnopods with his stun
wand He jabs the thing with it--TZZZZ--as it crumbles

STEADY
Fuckin’ ugly What the hell else

Steady makes for Felix about to mash his face in but
Wendy breaks them up

WENDY
Hey Cut it out I didn’t know
about these things okay I would
never have suggested we go this way
if I did
(beat to Felix)
My father created these

FELIX
For Quest’s contracting arm You
drop a whole nest into a combat
zone and save a bundle on bullets

STEADY
Clearly spiders don’t understand
the rules of engagement

Wendy shades her eyes looks toward a cluster of PALM TREES
on the horizon and stands tall She appeals to Steady

WENDY

James I know this is difficult
but if we stay on guard and keep
close you can still do what you
came here for We can find my Dad

(beat)
Not everything here wants to kill
us huh Felix

Felix shakes his head “no” as Steady collects himself

Wendy stands in the shadow of a STUNNING OASIS the best view
in the house She drapes the penguin necklace atop the
HEADSTONE flanked by Felix and Steady

FELIX
Let’s take five

WENDY
(raises her head)
No

A GURGLING pool springs a WATERFALL down the cliff face
Wendy reaches her arm elbow-deep into the water feels around
for something--KLUNK--and the pool begins to DRAIN

An ACCESS LADDER is exposed beneath that follows the cliff
face 25 stories down through the mist Dreyfuss whistles

DREYFUSS
We’re going down

WENDY
Against my better judgement

EXT CLIFF-FACE -- MOMENTS LATER

Steady leads everyone down the ladder all connected by a

Wes and Yari silently slog over Zenith’s hard drives
The OUTER RING slides into place and Yari smiles

Wes moves onto the next set of drives marked CLIMATE SYSTEMS

EXT CLIFF-FACE -- MOMENTS LATER
Wendy steps down another rung pauses to catch her breath

From beneath the rock-face scurry palm-sized MITES A GIANT
SALAMANDER-THING follows after brushes against Wendy’s hand
She slips for a moment knocks the creature off the rocks

She follows it down through the mist her vision goes BLURRY
Wendy clasps her hand back onto the rung and gulps for air

Felix looks to Wendy above trembling

FELIX
How goes it up there

WENDY
(through teeth)
I can’t do it I can’t

Suddenly the rain starts again On-off-on-off Like a hose
with a kink in it Puts Steady back in a bad mood

The water bubbles over and CASCADES right toward

WENDY

Looks DOWN where the view WARPS everything blurry with
VERTIGO She’s PUMMELED by the force of the waterfall loses
her grip and FALLS DOWN--

Connected by the safety line Wendy’s weight rips Felix
Steady and Dreyfuss from the ladder like Christmas lights

Wendy’s view CARTWHEELS as she passes through the mist
BLURRY GREEN for a moment then she PLUNGES

UNDERWATER

She’s forced under by the strength of the waterfall tries to
swim up is pushed down again--

A HAND reaches below grabs her by the pack and YANKS

We’re close

FROM ACROSS THE RIVERBED

Felix and Dreyfuss wring themselves out a few feet away
Everyone silently regroups presses onward through the
foliage beyond the river

Something raises its SILVERY HEAD into frame and WATCHES them
slip into the jungle It emits a soft sound a PURRING
then stalks off

INT SECONDARY LAB -- MOMENTS LATER

Alan flips through the manual scratches his head He moves
to the control pad at the edge of the catwalk reads aloud

ALAN
Reset coupling controls done
Enter five-digit repair code

The sound of a KLAXON as the wall beyond the catwalk SPLITS
reveals SPARE VIEWPODS hanging in the darkness beyond

ALAN (CONT’D)
Bingo Now come to Papa

He mashes another set of buttons -- but the control panel
BLEATS a negative tone at him Alan tries again ERRRR
He frowns goes back to poring over the manual

DISSOLVE TO

A MULTI-COLORED FINCH

Flits through the air We STAY CLOSE on it can’t see much
around us The thing lands on a NEEDLE THIN green branch
It HOPS to another evenly spaced then another--

Then it’s ENSNARED by a CAGE OF GREEN NEEDLES The finch is
EATEN by a GIANT VENUS FLY TRAP FROM HELL Feathers fly

EXT BRIAR PATCH -- DAY

Wendy Felix Dreyfuss and Steady come to the edge of a pit
that’s 10 feet down 500 yards across Like a cookie cut
from the jungle floor Dense FOG flows between TRELLISES
arranged in A TOPIARY MAZE

FELIX
Still know the path through

WENDY
You bet
(to Dreyfuss and Steady)
Masks You two That fog’1l
suffocate you And don’t touch

Anything
Wendy pulls on a GAS MASK with an air exchange that HISSES
She hops down the wall
INT TOPIARY MAZE -- MOMENTS LATER
Limited visibility in the mist

Steady brushes the wall of the maze as he passes by
A VINE curls around the strap on his pack It TUGS--

Steady draws his MACHETE and HACKS the plant Wendy calls
out from the front

WENDY
Yeah the walls are alive So

Everyone cautiously moves to the center single file

A TELEPHOTO LENSE

Focus pulls on a SEA of glistening PINK GLOBULES CLICK

DREYFUSS

Takes a snapshot of a STALKY PLANT potted in the corner It
towers over him droops like a street lamp covered in pink
GLUEY NODES

DREYFUSS
(sotto)
Just magnificent

He looks from Wendy to the plant then back to Wendy
Dreyfuss flares his nostrils reaches out and TAPS a section
of the pink nodes Snotty Dreyfuss wipes it on his pants

DREYFUSS (CONT’D)
(back to Wendy)
I touched it And nothing--

The stalk of the plant UNFOLDS and quickly CLOSES AROUND his
body Dreyfuss is ENVELOPED

DREYFUSS (CONTD)
(bloody murder)
Get me get me out

Everyone runs and grabs his hand his vest tries to pull him
free They WOBBLE the white ceramic pot the plant sits in

Dreyfuss’ cries CRESCENDO as the potted plant TOPPLES OVER
right into the wall of the topiary maze

The vines MOVE like ONE ORGANISM and SMOTHER his squeals
Dreyfuss is CONSUMED by the LIVING WALL ramblers snake
through his mouth and fill his mask

As he’s pulled into the brush Steady reaches to help
Wendy pulls him back

WENDY
It’ll get you too
(stands)
You gonna listen now

Steady angrily HACKS some more of the wall with his machete

EXT MAZE CENTER -- MOMENTS LATER

A sense of urgency now as Wendy PEELS BACK a strip of sod and
accesses a control panel at the CENTER of the maze They
stand at a clearing with a grassy knoll

INT ZENITH CONTROL -- SAME

Frustrated he finally HURLS the repair manual at it--

To his surprise the thing LIGHTS UP decelerators WHIR
The ski-lift mechanism pushes the viewpod into place at the
edge of the catwalk before Alan Bright shiny new

INT ARC HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

Fluorescents FLICKER as Wendy and Felix pad softly down a
narrow hallway Written in white letters

Asset Reclamation Container

They come to a BULKHEAD DOOR and Wendy pushes it open

THE ARC

Is a fortified bunker with TANDEM VIALS of DNA from every
plant and animal inside Lost Hills Alphabetized on ice

Liquid nitrogen cools the space Wendy hugs herself as she
walks past STORAGE CYLINDERS Felix removes a shinier
version of the GRAPPLING GUN from a case on the wall

There’s a WHITE GLOW behind a book case as Wendy peeks her
head around the corner

A small cot has been set up on the floor wrappers littered
about an electric lantern Dozens of octagonal cells are
propped up rotting Cielo Azul specimens underneath them

Martin lies askew on the bed mouth open Wendy quietly
gasps runs to him and kneels

WENDY
Dad oh Dad
(takes his hand)
He’s still warm

Martin SNORTS frightens Wendy as he opens his eyes and
WAKES UP Hair all flock-of-seaguls He blinks nervously

MARTIN
(groggy)
What is it Who’s there
(scrambles for glasses)
--Wendy Is that really you

WENDY
Dad the habitat’s a wreck

MARTIN
Wendy it’s Why you look even
more like your mother
(beat)
How did you find me

Felix emerges from the shadows

FELIX
I had to practically drag her here
And I don’t think she liked it
(beat)
Won’t you come out now that we
have ourselves a proper family
reunion

MARTIN
Felix you and I have already had
this conversation You are no
longer in my employ Please leave

WENDY
(revelatory)
He wasn’t lost

Wendy stands Felix aims his grappling pistol at her chest
It WHIRS baleful

FELIX

I’ve already gone quietly Martin
This time I’ve come with
considerably more enthusiasm

(to Wendy)
Ask your father how many times I’ve
propped him up from the wings of
this sideshow Every step he took
backward I helped him jump two
more ahead When the grants dried
up who brought you Quest Martin
Hmm When your wife lay dying who
kept her alive so you could say
your good byes

(beat seething)
Everything you touch you break
like a child’s toy Look around
You turned an Eden to hell

MARTIN
Felix Did I not treat you like
family

FELIX

I don’t think you know the meaning
of the word

Felix SNATCHES Martin’s tablet computer from Wendy’s belt

INT VIEWPOD -- MOMENTS LATER

Wes Yari and Alan cruise along the underside of the dome
A plume of RED SMOKE rises from the lowlands

YARI
Smoke

WES
Dude am I blind

Alan grips the leather strap anticipation all over his face

EXT MAZE CENTER -- MOMENTS LATER

Alan leaps out of the viewpod toward Wendy and Martin led
from the Arc by Felix gun at their backs He’s still got
Martin’s tablet tucked under his arm Wendy tries to eye
Alan but he’s fixated on Martin

ALAN
(offers his hand)
Thank God you’re alive sir I want
you to know that I’m committed to
your daughter Alan Harmon

WENDY
(awkward)
Alan wait
Felix JABS Wendy in the back with the gun Alan sees it
FELIX
By all means carry on This will

be the only chance you get

WENDY
We’re not going anywhere

MARTIN
Wendy I’m sure Felix is willing to
talk about this It’s not safe

WENDY
Damn right it isn’t

FELIX
(snickers )
Just as stubborn as the old man
WES AND YARI

Chuckle as they watch Martin

YARTI
Old guy Your team

Something PURRS from within the red smoke Wes and Yari stop
to look for a moment

FELIX

Recoils raises the grappling gun to Wendy’s CHEST

FELIX
Say hello to your mother for me
She was always my favorite--

Someone SCREAMS and Felix looks to see

Wendy SOCKS Felix across the jaw and knocks the tablet
computer from his hands Wendy YANKS Alan away from Felix

WES AND YARI

SHOUT and run from the red curtain of smoke as TWO JUNGLE
CATS bound from within and TACKLE the brothers

We see the cats in full view now FISH and FELINE the love
monster of a panther and a barracuda Covered in a thick
armor of SILVER SCALES their translucent incisors glisten
The cats SHIMMER with their hackles raised their tails
twitch to-and-fro

Wes SCREAMS in pure terror as the cat snatches his neck
bites down--CRRRAACK Wes lies quiet his head on wrong

Yari reaches for the stun wand at his side and jams it into
the cat’s soft belly The thing screams (the MGM lion in the
key of the violins from Psycho) and rolls off

The two cats see Wendy Alan Felix and Martin by the Arc and
pounce toward them Felix drags Martin away Steady flanks
fixated on the felines and narrows his eyes

STEADY
Screw my earnings I stroll out of
here with one of those slung over
my shoulders we call it even

FELIX
Be my guest They make horrid

pets anyway

Felix coolly raises his stun wand and SHOCKS Martin He
collapses into Steady’s arms is hauled inside the viewpod

WENDY
Dad No
(livid)
Felix You son of a bitch

FELIX
(mock salutes)
If you’re not at the table with us
then you’re on the menu

The mouth of the viewpod CLOSES and the thing speedily
ASCENDS toward the top of the dome

Yari leaps up and runs to his fallen brother as the cat he
stunned cautiously circles licking its chops

YARTI
Oh God He’s dead
(to cat with wand)
Stay back I mean it

Something BLEATS in the grass -- the tablet The other cat’s
distracted for a moment

Wendy cautiously steps toward the tablet but the cat
guarding reveals retractable CLAWS opaque nasty

It swipes and Wendy’s vest is SHREDDED

The two cats keep watch over their prey waiting

A THIRD CAT leaps through the red curtain of smoke

Our ALPHA FEMALE She stands taller and seethes malevolence
as she GNASHES at the other two She SCREECHES at Yari and
the other cats POUNCE toward him

He shocks one of them away and the other collides with his
shoulder--CRAACK Wendy drags Alan away back into the maze

The alpha female lifts her gaze after them and the other two
nervously pursue The Alpha eyes Yari licks her chops
THE TOPIARY MAZE

Wendy and Alan bolt to the left where they HIDE Wendy
peeks her head around the corner to see

The two SUBORDINATE CATS enter the maze after them They
pounce toward the same corner Wendy led Alan hide behind
WENDY

Clamps her hand over Alan’s mouth

THE CATS
Leap around--

To find NOTHING A potted Venus fly trap wobbles
conspicuously to the left They MEWL and sniff for a moment

WENDY AND ALAN

Hide behind the OPPOSITE END of the junction The cats turn
the corner across from them out of sight

Alan looks SCARED OUT OF HIS SKULL He hyperventilates and
almost backs into the maze wall -- the vines WRIGGLE for him
THE CATS

Return to the center of the junction frustrated

The wall ahead of them CONVULSES as if to say “Look here”
Wendy pulls Alan away from the wall and into plain sight

One of the cats licks its jowls and lunges to leap through
the air at Alan

Wendy YANKS him out of harms way and the cat goes TUMBLING
right into the TOPIARY WALL

The thing MEWLS as the vines wriggle their way beneath its
scales and drag it into the underbrush

The remaining cat licks its teeth raises its hackles--

It’s TACKLED in a BLUR OF FUR

LUKE AND LEIA

With their chests puffed up stand between the feline and its
prey Leia guards Wendy and Alan like a goalie while Luke
ROARS a mighty roar

Luke’s massive fist connects with the cat’s jaw knocks
scales into the grass The thing is dazed as Luke begins
with blows to the head and stomach

BLUE BLOOD sprays from its skull Luke quickly dispatches
the thing and twists its head all the way round

WENDY AND ALAN

Dash back through the topiary maze away from the sounds of
CARNAGE They come to the grassy center--

Where Yari keeps the alpha female at bay with his stun wand
Her gaze flits to Wendy and Alan as the Gorillas emerge from
the maze behind them She cocks her head impressed and
BARRELS past Yari eyes set on the primates

Luke and Leia crack their knuckles to meet the alpha’s CLAWS

Leia leaps onto her back and begins ripping out chunks of
scales and flesh Luke TEARS OUT the cat’s eye--REEEEE

She bucks the gorillas lets out a WARNING CRY and escapes
into the red smoke

Yari grabs his stun wand sniffles and sprints off after
Leia HUFFS signs to Wendy

LEIA
We have to get into the jungle
Where it is safe

Wendy eyes Martin’s tablet computer askew in the grass

EXT BRIAR PATCH -- MOMENTS LATER

get a signal He grabs her by the shoulder--

contingency a “reset” button in
case the habitat is compromised
Dad’s the only one who can activate
it Of course

(off Alan’s blank stare)
Come on Felix won’t see us coming
if he thinks we’re dead

The gorillas hoist Alan over the edge of the wall Alan
helps Wendy up frowns when he sees her hand

ALAN

You have to try The only way back
into the labs is on the other side

Wendy begins removing some of her bulkier gear Alan removes
his glasses his shoes Wendy signs to the gorillas

WENDY (CONTD)

You two get to high ground okay
I am going to stop Felix I will
not let him do you any harm

Luke and Leia embrace Wendy she holds them tight After a
moment they gallop off into the forest Wendy tucks
Martin’s tablet into her pack while Alan and Yari gulp

MOMENTS LATER

Yari clings to both of them as they make their way chest-deep
into the rapids Wendy cranes her neck observes the water

WENDY
We’re going to let the current take
us down a bit then see if we can’t
cut across in the shallows Ready

UNDERWATER

The BASIN of the river is made of CEMENT SEGMENTS covered in
moss and brown gloop A school of MINNOWS flit across--

They’re GULPED by a GAPING MOUTH lightning quick

THE RAPIDS

Churn and bubble around Wendy She lifts her knees floats
on her back shows Alan and Yari how to do the same
UNDERWATER

Something slick and black bumps against Yari’s leg Yari
accidentally kicks it in the head sends it threshing away
A CATFISH the size of a couch Its whiskers flit

THE RAPIDS

Yari sits up in the water wide-eyed

YARI
I just kicked something

Yari is SUCKED UNDER the water for a moment Alan reaches
beneath to grab him--

Yari breaks the surface SCREAMING straight out of Jaws
He’s HURLED AROUND and we can see the fish has got him down
its gullet to the waist It drags him

UNDERWATER

Where Yari GURGLES then he’s SLURPED DOWN like an oyster

THE RAPIDS
Alan and Wendy reach beneath to no avail

ALAN
(swallows water)
What the hell was that

WENDY
Okay everything here does want
to kill us Swim

The catfish crests the rapids again WRIGGLES toward them
Wendy and Alan pound the water furiously kick
FURTHER DOWNRIVER

Where the rapids slow There’s a rock that PROTRUDES from
the surface painted with red and white HAZARD STRIPES

The fish flounders to the surface behind them as Wendy begins
to BASH the top of the rock with her elbow and reveals a RED
LEVER Warning tape reads PUSH TO CLOSE

Wendy grabs the lever--

WENDY
It’s gonna go quick take a breath

--Alan gulps as Wendy SHOVES the lever forward

UNDERWATER

The catfish darts in for the kill A round DRAIN behind
it CORKSCREWS OPEN and sucks the fish down a manhole-sized
Dispos-All

WENDY AND ALAN

Watch as the river empties around them FLUSHED like the
world’s largest toilet Water SWIRLS in whirlpools and

they’re each pulled toward separate eddies--

--Wendy grips Alan’s elbow slips down to his wrist snags
his hand their fingers grapple--

They’re TORN APART by the force of the rapids each down

EXT RIVER BANK -- MOMENTS LATER

Chunks of soil trees and chaos slide muddily down the
EXPOSED RIVER With the facade of nature stripped away the

CRUSTED from the gorilla brawl She peers at one of the
GAPING DRAINS that flushed the river licks her jowls

A ROARING DIN inside a massive HOLDING TANK beneath the
river Alan SPLASHES to the surface gasps for air as he

pulls himself out of the churning water

The chamber is divided into sections that all flow toward a

GIANT MESS OF CLEAR TUBES at the far end

Alan sees Wendy flopped on her stomach a few feet
He runs to her and gently turns her over He goes
administer CPR but Wendy COUGHS water on her own

helps her turn her head

MOMENTS LATER

Wendy pries a metal grate open where the tubes converge
MITES scatter away from RUSHING WATER bubbling beneath

WENDY
Gotta skirt the reverse osmosis
chamber or we’ll have our guts
sucked out

She turns to lower herself into the tube takes a HUGE GULP
of air then she’s whisked away by the current inside

Alan dips his feet into the tube PANTS then sucks in a
final MOUTHFUL--

INT MEMBRANE TUBES -- SAME

Alan ROCKETS through the clear tube in a SPIRAL PATTERN
The world’s most expensive water slide

The membrane NARROWS toward the middle and Alan--SLUNK--
is squeezed between clear plastic He panics for a moment as
the pressure builds FWUMP He’s swept further through

THE SURFACE
They both shoot up out of the water She leads him toward

the edge where they lift themselves from the gigantic
freshwater tank

Wendy catches her breath while Alan marvels at the REVERSE
OSMOSIS CHAMBER submerged beneath sea level on the underside
of Lost Hills

The walls are massive clear panels with views of the ocean
360 degrees around Schools of fish swim by Alan turns
hikes his thumb at the underwater view

ALAN
You guys could put Sea World in the
dark ages with this

The whole chamber RUMBLES for a moment dust falls around
them Wendy removes the tablet from her pack scrolls

WENDY
In a few minutes this place is
going to be Sea World

Wendy moves toward a door marked MAINTENANCE ACCESS BEWARE
OF COUNTERMEASURES

She pries open the door Something CLICKS above and the
space is ENGULFED IN FLAMES

ALAN
Ah Countermeasures

The chamber RUMBLES again a crack SPIDERS ACROSS the glass
Water fissures Wendy and Alan lock eyes

She quickly scrolls through the tablet’s menu

WENDY
They’re supposed to keep the creepy-
crawlies out of the lab
(beat scrolls)
Try it now

Alan winces sticks his foot into the doorway--

CLICK WHOOOOOSH A continuous stream of flames Wendy
moves to the control panel beside the door punches numbers--

There’s a SPLASH from behind them as something FALLS from the

through the tank like a shark--

The alpha cat leaps from the water her tail FLARED WIDE like
a fan She dries herself by PUFFING UP her scales Then she
sees Alan and Wendy

All around them are examples of these BOTCHED SPECIMENS
An Arachnopod with too many legs One of the goats with its
spinal cord exposed

At the center of it all -- a massive version of the NANO-

when he sees Wendy and Alan The lab SHUDDERS a bit

Wendy locks eyes with Martin as Felix moves to a planter box
where Cielo Azul flower pods are potted They are all DEAD
or WILTING Felix glares at Martin

ruffles her scales and dries off Steady glares at her

The hangar bay doors SLAM CLOSED and alert the cat Felix
stands by the controls and--BLAM--shorts them out

her feet She looks on it with pity then flits her harsh
gaze at Steady Steady takes aim like a cowboy--

KNOCKS Steady head-first into the control panel on the side
of the gigantic Nano-Accellerator

Well I followed you to Santa Fe

then I “accidentally” bumped into
you again at the department mixer
You were so pretty

had bad intentions I was wrong to
bring you here

As a SHORTCUT Wendy LEAPS over one of the turbines Martin
goes to do the same--

The fan--GRRREEE--grinds to a halt and SHREDS through the
turbine exploding shrapnel The glass around the turbine
SHATTERS and the whole section CAVES into the habitat

Martin dives toward another fan as the glass all around him
crumbles Wendy doesn’t notice he’s CUT OFF

MARTIN
Wendy

Wendy skids to a stop and sees that Martin stands
precariously on a PENINSULA of steel

The whole section COLLAPSES a few feet as fire erupts from
the turbine behind Martin He makes like he’s going to jump--

The chasm widens more the sound of destruction DEAFENING
Martin backs away from the edge looks to Wendy

MARTIN (CONTD)
Go Go I’11 be fine

Wendy reluctantly leaves her father across the chasm

FELIX

Leaps onto a section of elevated CATWALK The whole thing
SHUDDERS with the force of destruction

The catwalk leads to a STRUCTURE like A PIMPLE on the
surface of the dome A glass observation deck converted
into A GREENHOUSE

Felix SHORTS the door controls with his stun wand and
enters

THE OBSERVATION DECK
The field-full of Cielo Azul Felix has been looking for

He collapses to his knees at the sight delicately runs his
hands over the bright blue flowers Then he greedily UPROOTS
as many as he can stuffs them into a GLASS CYLINDER--

KRAM Wendy TACKLES Felix face-first into the flower bed
She straddles him and knocks the cylinder away

EXT TOP OF THE DOME -- SAME
Lost Hills is burning

The support girders that hold the observation deck upright
CRUMPLE in the heat The deck SLAMS into the glass--

INT OBSERVATION DECK -- SAME

Wendy and Felix are THROWN across the greenhouse as the
SPRINKLER SYSTEM above swings down like a lapbar on a fair
ride and pins them to the floor

Only now the deck slopes down and they’re suspended above
the EXPOSED PIPES mere feet from being SKEWERED
Felix slips glares down wide-eyed He reaches for Wendy

FELIX
Wendy Help me up
(re the flowers)
Well give a gift to the world
Come now Help me back up

Felix clamors for Wendy’s hand After a beat she gives it
to him He clutches the pipe with one hand

FELIX (CONTD)
That’s a girl I’m not going to
die here--

Felix goes to grip with his other hand--

FELIX (CONTD)
--you are

Instead Felix swings his STUN WAND around

Wendy GASPS blocks his wrist the wand’s teeth SPARK inches
from her face There’s an intimate struggle with the wand
Wendy has the high ground though and she JABS Felix in the
neck with it He falls into the pit of exposed metal
IMPALED through the shoulder

She shakily lifts the pipe from her lap as the whole
observation deck GROANS

EXT TOP OF THE DOME -- SAME

Wendy crawls out of the airlock door and it closes after
She WAVES FRANTICALLY to the flock of helicopters circling
holds the glass cylinder aloft like a trophy

Behind her the section of dome beneath the observation deck
CAVES and the whole thing swings down out of sight begins
to DRAG the catwalk she’s on with it

Wendy dashes away on the backward conveyer belt as pieces of
the dome shatter and collapse all around her She dives to
an ISLAND of twisted wreckage--

A steel CABLE AND BASKET lower beside her Martin’s inside
Wendy looks up to see the COAST GUARD CHOPPER hover in the
sky She clings to Martin as he helps her into

THE BASKET

They’re hoisted up Wendy and Martin watch as the entire
lilypad begins to slip beneath the sea

With the north end SUBMERGED the south LIFTS OUT OF THE
OCEAN like the edge of a dinner plate hangs there--

Then the island SPLITS DOWN THE MIDDLE fire and water ERUPT
from inside as the separate halves SINK independently

The Coast Guard chopper speeds toward the mainland

INT OBSERVATION DECK -- MOMENTS LATER

Felix plants his hand against the cracked glass of the
greenhouse He drools blood SURROUNDED BY OCEAN

He puffs out his cheeks as--CREEEEEE--the glass begins to
spiderweb around him Felix INHALES--

The observation deck SHATTERS and he’s INSTANTLY CRUSHED by
the impending pressure as we

SMASH TO BLACK

FADE IN

EXT PACIFIC OCEAN -- LATER

A flock of seagulls feed on the floating corpses of the
Arachnopods The water begins to CHURN and BUBBLE around
them and they take flight as A BLACK VESSEL rises to the
surface with the aid of inflated AIR SACKS On the side

Asset Reclamation Container

EXT ALAMEDA AIR BASE -- DAY

Wendy and Martin sit inside an ambulance the Cielo Azul
canister between them in the sun EMTs pore over their
cuts and bruises

ACROSS THE TARMAC

Camera crews are held at bay by SFPD Suddenly they’re
ABUZZ as a BLACK SUV rolls in flanked by two more

Out steps Novick The news people SWARM He waves his hand
quiets them

NOVICK
What’s happened is unfortunate but
there will be no statements until I
see to our survivors

His security does their best to clear a path

WENDY

Sees him coming She stands--
NOVICK
(offers his hand)
Martin We’re so very thankful
that you’re alive--

--and SOCKS him across the jaw As Novick cradles his

the NEWS CREWS go crazy

NOVICK (CONTD)
(recoils)
Where’s Felix Tremain

WENDY
Yeah I don’t think Felix’1l be
taking credit for this one
(massages her knuckles)
Looks like it’s all on you

NOVICK
He’s

WENDY
»as a doornail Along with
everything else my dad built

Novick runs his tongue over his teeth

NOVICK
That’s not entirely accurate

Wendy cocks her head--

There’s a THUMPING overhead

cheek

Wendy waves Novick off as a Coast Guard chopper hoists THE

ARC and touches down on the tarmac ahead

INT THE ARC -- MOMENTS LATER

Acetylene torches slice through the metal bulkhead

entire container fills with bright light

The

A team of EMTs rush in only to be greeted by Luke and Leia
cradling Alan in their arms They tower over the humans

EMT
Everyone get back
(into radio)
Weve got something here--

ALAN
It’s okay
(to the gorillas)
You can put me down We are safe

Alan signs to the gorillas and they reluctantly place him on
the floor of the Arc Luke GRUNTS seemingly satisfied

As the EMTs cautiously move in with a stretcher something
SHINES on the floor gets Alan’s attention

EXT ALAMEDA AIR BASE -- DAY

Alan is hauled out on a stretcher as news choppers hover
above the base Wendy and Martin rush to his side with the
canister Alan shakily removes his oxygen mask

ALAN
Wendy

WENDY
Don’t speak Alan We got you out
just in time

Alan holds Wendy’s ENGAGEMENT RING aloft Wendy reaches for
it but Alan hangs on for a moment

ALAN
Wendy Keen Will you Again

WENDY
(a beat with the ring)
Grand Canyon right

ALAN
Really

WENDY
I said I’d think about it

Martin smiles

MARTIN
You take good care of her okay
She’s all I’ve got

ALAN
(coughs )
Yes sir

Wendy takes the ring and Alan is rushed to a waiting
MED-EVAC chopper

MOMENTS LATER

The news crews aim their lenses as Luke and Leia are escorted
by Wendy into cages with the Quest logo on them

WENDY
(off Luke’s look)
I will see you soon

She touches them on the cheek as they’re whisked away
Martin gazes across the bay

MARTIN
I lost what was most precious to
me How can I make it up to you
Wendy I thought I could save the
world

WENDY
Mom’s still with us Dad
No matter what happened

Wendy and Martin stand together on the tarmac chopper blades
WHIP their hair She smiles as Martin eyes the cylinder

WENDY (CONT’D)
And Dad

MARTIN
Hmm

Wendy raises

THE GLASS CYLINDER

Into the bright pure sunlight

The Cielo Azul flower pods inside UNFURL and BLOOM right
before our eyes Bright blue with an egg-yolk center
WENDY

Tucks the thing under her arm and takes Martin’s hand as the
two watch the gorillas loaded into a cargo plane and we

FADE OUT

THE END
