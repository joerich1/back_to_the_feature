INT THE FRONT ROOM OF A HOUSE IN BELFAST - DAY

Twelve-year-old COLLETTE MCVEIGH is absorbed in making a
necklace with a bucket of beads She’s listening to 10CC’s
hit single Rubber Bullets on the gramophone

Load up load up the rubber bullets
PUNCH UP JUNE 1973
COLLETTE’S father GERRY SENIOR puts his head around the
door He has interrupted a call and has his hand over the
receiver

GERRY SENIOR

Get us some fags love Your
mother’s run out

He disappears again COLLETTE continues with her fun a
moment then stands and walks through to the

INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

where her seven-year-old brother SEAN is eating a bowl
of cereal He’s a cute-looking kid the baby of the family

COLLETTE
Dad wants you to get some fags

SEAN
He asked you

COLLETTE
Doesn’t matter I went last time

SEAN rolls his eyes Sisters

EXT BELFAST STREET - CONTINUOUS

SEAN emerges into the street leaving the door open so that
10CC’s song comes with us

He instinctively turns left for the shop but then checks
himself There’s a huge riot at the other end of the
street Curiosity gets the better of him and he heads
towards it

Some kids are playing football Parents gossip in the
doorways every day life in a city torn apart by civil
strife
EXT FALLS ROAD - CONTINUOUS

SEAN’s POV as he steps out into the fringe of the riot
He can just make out his older brothers GERRY and PADDY
with masks around their faces throwing tear gas at the
soldiers The troops are using armoured Land Rovers as
barricades

A bus is burning

One hell of a playground

10CC have got to the chorus again Load up load up the
rubber bullets

Wham

He’s hit

On the ground

Silence

PADDY and GERRY running towards him A crowd gathering
Why can’t he hear anything What’s happening

SMASH CUT TO

EXT BELFAST STREET - SECONDS LATER

As the sound CRASHES BACK GERRY and PADDY are stumbling
down the street with SEAN in their arms They are
surrounded by rioters onlookers neighbors

Chaos Shouts Voices It’s Sean Aye it’s wee Sean Jesus
Christ it’s Sean Bastards Theyve shot wee Sean

INT COLLETTE’S PARENTS HOME - THE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

The crowd tumbles in

GERRY lays his baby brother gently down on the floor

GERRY (CONTD)
Dad

He bends over him

GERRY (CONT’D)
Jesus Sean Speak to me

GERRY SENIOR and SEAN’s MOTHER appear in the doorway MA is
white as a sheet as GERRY SENIOR thrusts the others aside
He takes SEAN’s pulse Tries CPR
Nothing
Tries again
The room grows quiet MA falls to her knees

MA
Speak to me Sean

Silence
A hand on his cheek

MA (CONT’D)
Speak to me my boy

He’s dead

She puts her arms around him and draws him to her chest
She starts to cry It’s gut-wrenching heart-breaking

GERRY SENIOR catches sight of COLLETTE’s stunned face in
the throng He yanks her into the
INT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
where she retreats from his fury
They stare at each other
GERRY SENIOR
(quietly)
What happened

No answer

GERRY SENIOR (CONTD)
I asked you to go

No answer
GERRY SENIOR (CONTD)
(louder )
Why wasn’t it you

She takes a few more paces back

GERRY SENIOR (CONTD)
It should have been you

He pushes her into
INT FRONT ROOM - CONTINUOUS
--and slams the door
The noise recedes
Terror in her eyes Desolation Isolation
Silence again
Until we can just make out her breathing
FADE TO BLACK
IN THE DARK THE SOUND OF BREATHING AGAIN BUT THIS TIME
URGENT HURRIED

CRASH IN

expect But maybe it’1ll help

He closes his briefcase leaves

He watches from the other side of the glass She stares at
the file like it’s a contagious disease

He walks around the corner gets a cup of coffee and slips
out to the

MAC (CONT’D)

MAC (CONTD)

That would lead to a lot of

awkward questions

No answer

MAC (CONTD)
(flicking through)

What were you planning to tell

them That their kit didn’t work

That you were being followed

No answer He leans forward

MAC (CONTD)
You didn’t set the timer
Collette This thing couldn’t
have blown up a fucking paper
bag

COLLETTE
Id like to speak to my lawyer

MAC
You come all the way over here
but you were planning to fire a
dud Why

No answer

MAC (CONT’D)
So here’s a girl who puts flowers
on a victim’s grave And who
suddenly can’t bring herself to
arm the bomb she’s been sent to
plant

Still none

MAC (CONTD)
Maybe your brothers would say
youre betraying Sean’s memory
But I--

COLLETTE
(with a flash of anger
he’s touched a nerve)
I have a right to speak to a
legal representative

MAC takes a video tape from the briefcase slaps it into
the machine bangs it shut and presses play We see a
grainy undercover shot of COLLETTE and her five-year-old
son MARK walking home from school

She’s trying not to watch but it’s hard He’s a cute-
looking boy Her son Her pride and joy Not much younger
than Sean was when he died

The tape goes on rollingand rolling
We can just make out his voice now chattering to her

COLLETTE turns away She’s a soldier of war Like her
brothers Just got to hold on

God it’s hard
Bastard

MAC

(quietly)
You know what it’s going to be
like an Irish girl in an English
jail Every time you want to see
your boy his grandmother will
have to load him onto a ferry and
drive four hundred miles It’1l
break his heart

A beat
MAC (CONTD)

Maybe we can talk to our friends
in the social services See if we
can have him put up for adoption
After all he’d surely be better--

COLLETTE reaches forward suddenly to stop the tape
seizes her wrist

MAC (CONTD)
Tell me you don’t believe in
something better

She tries to withdraw but he won’t let go

MAC (CONTD)
You can have it

She struggles free He sits back

MAC (CONTD)

(sighs )
Maybe your leaders are serious
about peace this time We have to
believe that But your brother
Gerry will kill it off if he
possibly can Is that what you
want

No answer

MAC (CONTD)

You agree to talk to us to watch
him and you’re out of here like
nothing ever happened Back to
your Mother Back to your boy
Well pay you Well And one day
if you want it we can give you a
life far away from this

COLLETTE
Id like to call my lawyer now

MAC
This is the road you took when
you put flowers on Raymond
Quinn’s grave Collette It’s the
road you took when you decided
not to arm that--

COLLETTE
(exasperated)
You don’t know a damned thing

A beat He looks at her Hard

and MAC

MAC
I know it bugs the hell out of
you your mother won’t get the
washing machine fixed I know you
ask yourself why your boy still
wets his bed at night I know you
were so lonely the evening before
you came here that you went home
with a guy you don’t even like I
know he fucked you so roughly
that--

COLLETTE
(on her feet pushing
the table back)
For Christ’s sake--

MAC
(on his feet also)
You went back to your mother’s
place took your son into your
arms and cried until it was time
to leave

COLLETTE
I want To speak To a--

MAC
Jesus You people have no sense
of irony

He scoops up the files and puts them back in his briefcase
The interview is over

MAC (CONT’D)
If you want to take your anger to
the grave be my guest But you
can be fucking sure youll take
your son with you

attractive but dresses to hide it She’s calm focused a
little icy even She’s considerably younger than MAC

Some of her officers lurk in the hedgerows A car guns down
the lane lights spinning in the darkness A little rat of
a man named GINGY HUGHES steps out

FLETCHER
(like a mother scolding
her son)

is not afraid to use her femininity

FLETCHER (CONTD)
We need you Gingy More than
ever You know that If McVeigh
and Fox are linking up

He closes his eyes He doesn’t want to do this

There is something impressive and at the same time
completely grotesque about the way she holds him in place

A hard woman to break free from In every way

The wind rattles the windows and they look around but it’s
nothing Just a ghost in the night

GINGY

MULGREW
Ayemaybe youse’re right The
quality of mercy should not be
strained What about that

MULGREW touches GINGY’s shoulder paternally but we see
from the faces of his crew that they don’t buy the
possibility of a reprieve

CLOSE on the youngest He looks like he’s about to shit his
pants

MULGREW pulls the trigger GINGY slumps forward dead

MULGREW turns away He looks irritably at his shoes to make
sure there is no blood on them

An ordinary family scene MARK is finishing his tea whilst
COLLETTE and her MOTHER wash up The door opens and in walk
COLLETTE’S two brothers GERRY and PADDY GERRY is taller
and older He is brooding and handsome with cropped hair
naturally a leader But PADDY got all the emotional
intelligence He is shorter and bulkier with long unkempt
hair and a moustache

There’s a warmth here They’re a family right or wrong

PADDY
We heard a rumour our girl was
back

He hugs his sister and whispers

It was all over the news Ma’s
been in pieces

He kisses his mother GERRY takes a hunk of bread off the
side and wipes some of the left-over gravy from MARK’s
plate He winks at his sister

Prime Ministers are giving a press conference

He looks at her

MA (CONTD)
And who’s to say it isn’t
something

He turns back to the TV and whacks up the volume The
British Prime Minister John Major is answering a
question

MAJOR
Of course the document entertains
the possibility of a united
Ireland But it also very clearly
recognises the right of the
people of Northern Ireland to
determine their own future Any
process must be based on the
consent of both communities

We cut back to the newscaster He intones gravely

NEWSCASTER
But even as the two Prime
Ministers made that announcement
police in Northern Ireland
discovered a hooded body on the
border

Now we’re looking at shots of GINGY’s house Kids toys lie
abandoned in the garden

NEWSCASTER (VO) (CONTD)

The dead man has been named as Mr
Gerard ‘Gingy’ Hughes His family
deny claims that he was a
security force informer

who knows -- he’s a little envious That isn’t his style

GERRY
Glad you made it

She nods still watching her son

GERRY (CONTD)
Were they waiting

She hesitates like she’s working out what’s best to say

COLLETTE
Yeah

GERRY gets up again and for a moment we think he’1ll place
a hand upon her shoulder but it’s beyond him He
disappears into the house

PADDY joins her MARK jumps onto his lap again

PADDY
Aaagh You little bugger Go
shoot at goal Man U one nil down
with a minute to go Penalty

MARK trudges off happily PADDY turns to his sister

PADDY (CONT’D)

the swing They both know it’s more complicated than that

PADDY (CONT’D)
(quieter)
How ‘bout you

COLLETTE
I’m fine

He ruffles her hair

PADDY
They said on the news the girl
ran down a tube tunnel

PADDY looks at her These are crazy risks we run

COLLETTE
What do you reckon on this
document

PADDY
Gerry says our leaders want a
ticket to fancy handshakes at the
White House

COLLETTE
What do you think

A beat

PADDY
We made a promise That’s what
Gerry says

So there it is GERRY is the self-appointed keeper of the
flame And they’re all still trapped by that day

Except that COLLETTE isn’t any more Or maybe she is ON

finally gives the door a good KICK It starts to work
again As she smiles to herself it springs an alarming
leak

COLLETTE
ShitMam

MA comes in and now the two women fiddle with the dials
Eventually MA switches it off at the wall and pushes the
door shut hard enough to stem the leak

forehead A moment of unalloyed warmth But it doesn’t fix
the yawning chasm between them

COLLETTE is taking MARK to school an arm around his
shoulder She’s stopped to chat to a friend Just small
talk He’s out of control so he is Someone should tell
her But the friend seems kind of in a hurry to move on
like she doesn’t want them to be seen together in public

CLOSE on COLLETTE for a beat as she reads this Not the
first time by any means but a tiny wound all the same

They break up COLLETTE and MARK walk away past an army
patrol A soldier suddenly blocks her way He’s an older
guy with a rugged face but he’s friendly Or at least
polite

SOLDIER

We need to check your bag Ma’am

She lets him search it No point in a confrontation

SOLDIER (CONTD)
Your pockets

COLLETTE
Sargeant I’m just taking my son
to school

But he’s not budging She spreads her arms

SOLDIER
Perhaps youd be kind enough to
step into the doorway here

COLLETTE frowns But the guy is still being extremely
polite so she complies

SOLDIER (CONTD)
If you could put your arms
against the wall

She shakes her head but does so The long RAINCOAT she is
wearing is spread wide like a bat’s wings Or a screen

The soldier checks her raincoat pockets

He begins with her right wrist The search is tight It is
slow

Too slow

child’s picture It depicts a man with a gun lying ina
pool of blood

COLLETTE stares at the painting She doesn’t look like she
really wants to deal with it

Davies

Volunteer-

Miss McVeigh I don’t seek to
make a judgement I just want to
draw your attention to the fact
that your son is struggling to
concentrate on his school work

COLLETTE
(chastened)
I understand

HEADTEACHER

Your mother said that Mark had

been upset by your recent

winding through the headstones COLLETTE and her MOTHER
walk arm in arm MA carries two bunches of flowers and a
brand new LIVERPOOL scarf

They stop before a grave The headstone reads SEAN MICHAEL
MCVEIGH BELOVED SON MURDERED BY CROWN FORCES

black ties and black shoes wait to carry BASEBALL CAP’s
coffin They’re surrounded by a crowd of mourners outside a
terraced house GERRY MCVEIGH is among them PADDY and
COLLETTE stand either side of him But we can pick out MA
too

This is the community the IRA wants to believe it
represents

Cops dressed in riot gear pack the street A helicopter
hovers above A shot from its MONITOR reveals the cops
fanning out into dozens of surrounding alleys It looks
like a siege In a sense it is

BASEBALL CAP’s family stand by the doorway waiting for the
procession to begin They look tense They wouldn’t have
chosen an IRA ‘military’ funeral

As the coffin emerges draped in an Irish flag a police
COMMANDER approaches GERRY who is clearly the ranking IRA
Man present He raises his wooden baton

COMMANDER
We agreed there’d be none of
this

GERRY ignores him nods for the pallbearers to continue
The officer raises his stick again

COMMANDER (CONT’D)
No paramilitary displays You’re
not going to bury this man as a
soldier McVeigh Not on my
watch

GERRY
There is no display

COMMANDER
That’s a colour party

GERRY
It’s a few grieving men

COMMANDER
Split them up and have others
carry it or this is going
nowhere

GERRY stares at the man He oozes a visceral tribal
hatred like those around him

But a confrontation would upset the family Reluctantly he
nods to the men to indicate he concedes

INT CHURCH - A FEW MINUTES LATER

The coffin has reached the church but there is no respite

Whatever message we may wish to
give to the massed ranks of the
crown forces who besiege this
church today whatever hatred we
may tell ourselves it is our
right to harbour in our hearts I
must say this to the paramilitary
leaders why did you send this
young man to his death

On GERRY as he tries to retain his composure

PRIEST (CONT’D)
After so many years of
bitterness what do you hope to
achieve with this daily litany of
death Peace as Yeats once told
us may come dropping slow but
come it must

On MA The priest reflects her sentiments exactly

Back to GERRY who really can’t stand to listen to much
more of this

to face the loyalist thugs in the street behind them They
begin to charge towards the men until one opens up with a

MAC He is closest to the thugs half-hidden behind a car
ON HIM as he pulls out his Browning revolver

Shouldn’t be doing this Not his gig

He stands aims fires -- misses

One of the thugs has seen him swings around

MAC doesn’t flinch He steps into the road takes aim
again Blam blam blam -- and the guy goes down

The other two thugs are still shouting As one of them goes
to throw a pipe bomb MAC CUTS HIM DOWN

One left He hasn’t got a gun He’s thrown his bombs
MAC closes in

The guy raises his hands

The cops have woken up and are advancing behind MAC but
some of the IRA men have slipped through the lines They

CHARGE towards the loyalist thug Suddenly it’s a race to
see who can get there first

MAC wins grabs him turns his gun on the would-be lynch
mob

MAC
Get back

They keep coming Slowly With menace The cops are trying
to push them away but they want this guy bad Voices You
lookin after your Proddy friends Bastards

A couple of the men lunge closer

to BEAT THEM BACK

hard to credit)
You want a ceasefire now

We’re not there yet Gerry

What’s on the table

What’s on the table is the square
route of fuck all so it is

of surrender

of the IRA’s sword is always
going to be there always ready

hear a Christmas carol ‘As shepherds watched their flocks
by night’

MAC manages a world-weary smile Complicated as it may be
it’s good to be home

He’s about to move to the front door when another man
appears in the living room He’s carrying a glass of
champagne for MAC’s wife and she is SMILING AT HIM

knocks over the table GERRY’s glass of beer has been
standing on GERRY leaps to his feet soaked

bang on the money And the contrast with his own life is
painful

She roots around in her husband’s drinks cupboard and holds

up a bottle of whisky triumphantly

MAC
No thanks

FLETCHER (CONTD)
If I’d known you were on your
own I’d have invited you to join
us

No she wouldn’t

FLETCHER (CONTD)
Shoot Mac

MAC
Why have you locked the Henderson
file

KATE shrugs like she doesn’t know what MAC is talking
about

FLETCHER
Maybe it was London

MAC
My Dad had an old saying if it
looks like a dog and barks like a
dog it’s a fucking dog

FLETCHER
(half smiling but still
as cool as you like)
That’s a new one on me Mac

MAC
Barry Delavine works the same
side of the street So if you
were pumping his hand it must
have been because he had another
angle on Henderson Another angle
means another tout

KATE FLETCHER looks at him She really doesn’t want to go
here

MAC (CONTD)
Collette McVeigh was your idea
So I’m asking myself why

FLETCHER
Mac--—

MAC
I spend eight months reeling her
in and you’re prepared to burn
her on day one Why

FLETCHER
Mac please I--

MAC

I’1l1 tell you why because you
already have another agent in
place Someone close to her
bigger better Mulgrew and his
friends started sniffing around
so you needed someone you could
feed them if they get too close

She’s grim-faced now

FLETCHER
Ive known worse results Mac

He stares at her He can’t quite believe he heard that

FLETCHER (CONTD)
She’s a good agent but not a
great one Sometimes we have to
choose

MAC
You cannot--

FLETCHER
We can And I do That’s my job
There are no easy choices This
is a war And we have to win it

MAC
(leaning forward)
You think we can win anything if
were that cynical

FLETCHER
Do you think we can win if we’re
not

Boy two different styles

MAC
There are no winners here Kate
There never have been And there
never will be

not forget that

brother knew the full details of
the Henderson operation right

GERRY gives a barely perceptible nod

CHIEF OF STAFF (CONT’D)

discussed that

MI5 OPS OFFICER (CONTD)
We think the residence is a
better target The Ambassador is
a distant cousin of the Queen and
the house itself is more--

MAC
(straightening)
It’s not Paris

They all look at him including FLETCHER

MAC (CONTD)
Gerry McVeigh wants something big
enough to derail the process
That ain’t the British ambassador
or any other target in Paris

FLETCHER
So

MAC
He needs scale or scope Scale
maybe a military barracks He
could drive to one of the
Rhineland bases in a night
Scope we should run a check on
all the grade one targets and
their movements over the next 24
hours the Queen Prime Minister
Charles We know Gerry’s had his
own man in London Stands to
reason this is why

But we’ve got every exit covered
