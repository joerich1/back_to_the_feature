FADE IN

--CLOSE ON A MAN’S FACE 2

He is STARING at us with fixed concentration He is
sweating slightly in the summer heat We hold for a
moment Silence apart from the soft swish of an unseen
ceiling fan

WIDE SHOT - the Man wearing military uniform sits at
his desk in his office still staring straight ahead

SUPERED TITLES appear reading General Putkin United
States Army Intelligence SED Arlington Virginia 1983

The General’s assistant LIEUTENANT BOONE sits at his
desk working After a moment Putkin seems to come to a
decision

GENERAL PUTKIN
(solemnly
Boone

LIEUTENANT BOONE
Yes General

GENERAL PUTKIN
I’m going into the next office

LIEUTENANT BOONE
Yes sir

The General stands up smooths down his uniform steps
out from behind his desk and begins to walk Boone
watches with some trepidation as the General increases
his pace He quickens to a jog his face set with
determination

He breaks into a run

Then he slams into the WALL of the office rebounds and
lies splayed on the floor

He stares up at the wall balefully

GENERAL PUTKIN
Damn it

military base He has a band-aid over his injured nose
SUPERED TITLES read Special Forces Command Centre Fort
Bragg North Carolina

GENERAL PUTKIN (0S)
I have been having ideas
gentlemen Challenging ideas And
when I thought about these ideas I
thought about who in the US Army
would be most receptive to my
challenging ideas

The Jeep pulls up at the SPECIAL FORCES COMMAND CENTRE
The General gets out a brief case in his hand and
surveys the centre

GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT’D) (0S)
(CONTD)

Which section of the military is

always straining to reach the peak

of their physical and mental

capabilities

INT SPECIAL FORCES COMMAND CENTRE - DAY 4

General Putkin stands in front of a room full of seated
SPECIAL FORCES OFFICERS

GENERAL PUTKIN
You are gentlemen Special
Forces

The assembled Officers nod modestly

GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT’D)
I want to talk to you about Mind
Wars gentlemen WarWith
MINDS

His audience stare at him With a flourish he produces a
BENT FORK from his briefcase

GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT’D)
How’d you like to be able to do
this What if you could teach
soldiers to do this Would you be
interested

Silence

(CONTTNURFD )

GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT’D)

(changing tack)
Or or let’s say you have a unit
operating outside the protection
of mainline units What happens if
someone gets hurt How do you deal
with that

He surveys the blank faces

GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT’D)
Psychic healing Protect the unit
with hands-off healing Using the
mind to heal

Silence Putkin senses he is not convincing his audience

GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT’D)
Let’s talk about time What if
time is not a point but a space
and at any one instant we can be
anywhere in that space (Laughing)
Physicists go nuts when I say
that

Silence He is growing desperate

GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT’D)
Animals Stopping the hearts of
animals This is the idea I’m
coming to you with You have
access to animals right

Special Forces look like they’ve had enough A tough

looking officer - MAJOR JIM HOLTZ - stirs
MAJOR HOLTZ

No sir We don’t have access to
animals

EXT SPECIAL FORCES COMMAND CENTRE - DAY

A dejected General Putkin climbs back into his jeep

Lieutenant Boone in the driving seat looks at him with

sympathy

BOB (VO)
In 1983 when Special Forces told
General Putkin that they weren’t
interested in his ideasthat was
a lie

BOB (VO)
And when they told him they didn’t
have access to animalsthat was
also a lie

We FOCUS on the window - a shaky ZOOM taking us towards
an abandoned looking HOSPITAL BUILDING half hidden by
trees

INT ABANDONED HOSPITAL - DAY 7

We TRACK forward into the shadowy interior into a large
space which we now see is full ofGOATS

BOB (VO)
The hundred goats in the disused
hospital building had been
secretly flown in from Central
America so as to avoid customs
Special Forces weren’t worried
about the General hearing the
goats because they’d been de-
bleated

The GOATS stare at us their mouths silently opening and
closing

BOB (VO) (CONTD)
This is the story of those goats

We CLOSE ON the unblinking EYES of one GOAT then

My name is Bob Wilton Imagine me
back in Michigan where I was born

We PAN to the next desk and Bob’s over-weight colleague
RON who sits eating a hot-dog

BOB (CONT’D) (VO) (CONTD)

Ron suddenly pitches violently forward thudding face-
first into his desk

BOB (CONT’D) (VO) (CONTD)
He’s the man who died

INT OFFICE - LATER 9

Bob is clearing Ron’s desk putting his possessions into
a box

BOB (VO)
My wife Debora told me later
that Ron’s death had been like a
wake-up call for her - what people
used to call a memento mori

Bob sits down feeling a little ghoulish at the dead
man’s desk He notices a large INDENTATION on the leather
in front of him - the mark left by Ron’s forehead He
touches it fascinated

BOB (CONT’D) (VO) (CONTD)
That massive coronary had reminded
her that life was too short to
waste any chance of true
happiness

Bob rests his own forehead experimentally onto the
indentation and sits there face down on the desk His
eyes wander over to where Dave and Debora are talking in
Daves office

BOBS POV - Debora’s hand BRUSHES against Dave’s
LINGERS just a fraction too long

Bob frowns

the time We couldn’t see beyond

our little lives to the great

events of history unfolding out

there in the world

JUMP CUT to Dave holding Bob in a head-lock with his one
good arm Debora is sitting head in hands

BOB (CONT’D) (VO) (CONTD)
I was like a child Or a Hobbit
safe in the Shire

JUMP CUT to Bob alone in the trashed room exhausted and
drunk watching Bush’s STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH on TV

BOB (CONT’D) (VO) (CONTD)
Or a blonde farm boy on a distant
desert planet unaware that he was
already taking the first steps on
the path that will lead him
inexorably towards the heart of a
conflict between the forces of
Good and Evil

PRESIDENT BUSH
(on TV)
Americans are a resolute people
who have risen to every test of
our time Adversity has revealed
the character of our country to
the world and to ourselves

Bob wipes his eyes stares at the screen

BOB (VO)
Had I known where that path would
lead had a soft wind from my
future brought me the name of Bill
Django I might never have gone
But as it was I did what so many
men have done throughout history
when a woman has broken their
heart I went to war

BOB
Actual invisibility

LYN CASSADY
Wellyeah that was the goal

reality you learn to dance with
invisibility

Bob tries to follow this

BOB

Bill always said it started for
him when he fell out of a
helicopter in Vietnam

EXT VIETNAM - DAY - THE PAST 28

Bill hits the ground which is luckily mainly composed of
MUD He lies stunned as MORE HELICOPTERS lower around him
and his PLATOON begin to debark The Helicopters barely
touch the ground before they take off again SUPERED
TITLES read Vietnam January 1973

Bill gets up onto his knees and examines his M-16 - the
barrel clogged with earth He pokes his finger into the
muzzle trying to clean it then finds he can’t get it
back out again

BILL DJANGO
Oh man

He tries to pull his finger free glances up and FREEZES

Ahead of Bill and his Platoon is a WALL OF DEAD AMERICAN
TROOPS - rotting in the sun

His men stand staring at the wall aghast A PRIVATE
beside Bill snaps and opens FIRE yelling wildly

BILL DJANGO (CONTD)
(over the gun-fire)
Knock-it off Chris Knock-it off

Bill grabs him with his free hand and shakes him his M-
16 hanging painfully from his other hand

Will you knock it off (Climbing
to his feet) Jesus What do you
think

his head sprayed over nearby soldiers

another SOLDIER DROPS The others flinch scan the tree-

BILL DJANGO
What the fu Why isn’t anyone
firing

His men stare back at him frightened

BILL DJANGO (CONTD)
TAKE HER OUT

The Soldiers open fire - a deafening roar The Woman
keeps on running as the foliage above her head is
shredded by bullets NO SHOT COMES CLOSE Bill watches
amazed

BOB (VO)
Every single one of Bill’s men
fired high They instinctively
hadn’t wanted to shoot another
person Later Bill would come
across a study by General SLA
Marshall which revealed that only
15-20 percent of fresh soldiers
shot to kill The rest
aimed high didn’t fire at all or
pretended to be busy doing
something else

Bullets still flying above her head the Woman stops
running crouches down and RETURNS FIRE

Bill is SHOT stumbles backwards and falls into the mud
his finger still stuck in his M-16 He lies there
staring up at the sky his expression one of puzzlement
as a huge blood stain spreads over his chest

BILL’S POV - the edges of our vision darken down as the
sound FADES OUT The darkness flows inwards as if an
IRIS IS CLOSING DOWN - until only a PIN-POINT OF WHITE
LIGHT remains in the centre of the sky We begin to move
towards the light slowly at first and then faster and
faster Just as we are about to reach it a VISION OF THE
FACE OF the VC WOMAN appears filling the white disc

What Bill hadn’t told the Pentagon
was that he was really looking for

What attempt

BRIGADIER GENERAL HOPGOOD
There was no attempt sir It
seems the story was a French hoax

Let’s say we have no choice but to
fight with these men Then
we use visual aesthetics to
instill psychically in the enemy a
disincentive to attack

What do you mean

After a year’s training Lyn was
given his first tasking A senior
Nato General had been kidnapped by
Red Brigade members in Italy Bill

was unofficially

asked if his unit would be able to
help find him before it was too

late

LYN CASSADY
(concentrating)

We’re north of Verona It’s a

nearby I can see a Cinema

Across

from the Cinema is a shop or

Bill looks proudly over to where an important looking

OFFICIAL watches from the next room
impressed

BOB (V0O)

The Official looks

It’s true that the unit never
found out whether any of their
remote viewings were accurate or
not Nevertheless from that moment

on Lyn’s reputation soared

INT EX-MESS HALL - DAY

Lyn stands in front of the other Jedis

BILL DJANGO

Rank medalsthese things mean
little to the Jedi But growth in
spirit in wisdom in psychic
power these things earn our

respect

He presents Lyn with an EAGLE FEATHER

BILL DJANGO (CONTD)
Native Americans believed that

when one received an Eagle

feather it was the mark of love
of gratitude and ultimate respect
Only true Human Beings may carry

the Eagle feather

He gives the feather to a deeply moved Lyn as the other
Jedis applaud Larry watches Lyn with HATE

Feather on a chain around his neck A period song is
playing in the room

The word soon got out in the
intelligence community that there
was a sergeant at Fort Bragg who
could find whatever you needed
found It was as if Lyn could fly
anywhere in the world without
leaving his room

We TRACK INTO LYN’S EYE - UNTIL WE ARE INSIDE HIS MIND

-as the Pick-up with Bob and Lyn in the back pulls up
next to another TRUCK

Two MEN dressed in black with their kaffiyeh covering
their faces stand by it staring at them In the back seat
of the Truck sits a blindfolded IRAQI MAN

The Driver of the Pick-Up crosses to the TWO INSURGENTS
with a half-gallon bottle of WATER and passes it to them
They drink and confer briefly in Arabic He turns and
gestures to the other two Young Iraqis who push Lyn and
Bob down from the back of the pick-up Lyn stands still

The First Young Iraqi gestures more angrily at the Truck

YOUNG IRAQI
Edkhol

LYN CASSADY
Don’t move Bob

BOB
(scared whispering)
Are you going to use the Blob

LYN CASSADY
Let’s hope it doesn’t come to
that

One of the Insurgents stirs and says something softly in
Arabic The other laughs Angrily the First Young Iraqi
takes out a HANDGUN and levels it at Lyn

YOUNG IRAQI
EDKHOL

Lyn raises one hand towards him

LYN CASSADY
You can put your weapon away
You’re not interested in us

The Young Iraqi points the gun at Bob who starts to walk
towards the truck

LYN CASSADY (CONTD)
(firmly )
Stay where you are Bob

Bob stops

BOB
Shitshit

LYN CASSADY
(to the Iraqi
calmly)
We can go about our business

Apparently having had enough one the Insurgents pulls his
own GUN out and aims at Lyn The tension builds Suddenly
Bob remembers the phrase he was taught

BOB
(blurting)
La termi ana sahafi

(CONTTNURFD )

102108 58 89

Immediately everyone stares at Bob The Insurgent OPENS
FIRE at him

Terrified Bob dives across the sand The Young Iraqi
behind him also scrambles for cover

Still firing the Insurgent is suddenly aware of Lyn
sprinting towards him Before he can turn to aim at him
Lyn LEAPS into the air spinning around face contorted
as he emits a bizarre SHRIEK

We FREEZE-FRAME ON HIM HUNG IN MID-AIR

BOB (CONT’D) (VO) (CONTD)
Now at the time I thought Lyn was

having some kind of fit here

Later I discovered what he was

actually doing was performing the
Echmeyer technique

INT DOJO - DAY - THE PAST 90

CLOSE on a man who looks like WOODY ALLEN in a jungle
hat He has his eyes closed in IMMENSE CONCENTRATION A
bead of sweat runs down his face SUPERED TITLES read

with sixty-three confirmed kills
He remains the only non-Korean to
achieve the rank of Master in Kwa

teachers at Fort Bragg

SHOOTING from behind Ben to the rows of JEDI RECRUITS
watching with expressions of mingled admiration and
horror

BOB (VO) (CONT’D)
It was said he could have a tug of
war with a dozen men and not move
an inch

We PAN DOWN the back of BEN and find he is NAKED from the
waist down A SAND BAG is somehow hanging between his
legs

EXT ARMY BASE - DAY - THE PAST 91

OVER-HEAD SHOT - Ben lies on the ground staring up at us
We hear the sound of an approaching engine

BOB (VO)
Another demonstration involved
letting a recruit drive a jeep
over him This in the end was to
be his undoing

Next second a JEEP roars straight over Ben going at
sixty miles an hour

We FREEZE FRAME on the JEEP

BOB (VO) (CONTD)
Before his untimely death Ben
caused quite a stir by advocating
his controversial “shock and awe”
knife attack method

INT DOJO - DAY 92

Ben leaps spastically in the air spinning and shrieking
a knife held in one hand

BOB (VO)
The approach was hailed by some
knife aficionados as revolutionary
but criticized by others who
believed that the leaping and
spinning might lead you to
accidentally stab yourself

TRACKING ALONG BEN’S TRAINEE JEDIS - as they watch his
display

BOB (VO) (CONT’D)
Lyn Cassady however became a
firm convert to the style

We reach LYN who TURNS TO CAMERA

LYN CASSADY
Ben you’re not forgotten The
knife you gave me lies next to my
beret God bless Ben Echmeyer

102108 60

EXT DESERT - EARLY MORNING 93

We UN-FREEZE ON LYN - as he whirls and shrieks towards
the Insurgent Bob watches amazed from where he lies on
the sand

BOB (VO)
Of course Lyn didn’t actually
have a knife with him at this
particular timeso I still think
what he did was kindareckless

The Insurgent understandably startled flinches
backwards trips over the water bottle and falls on his
ass

Lyn scoops up the gallon bottle of water and begins to
POUND the fallen man with it The Young Iraqi moves to
intervene but Lyn smacks him in the face with the bottle

The BLINDFOLDED IRAQI IN THE TRUCK manages to open the
door and stumbles out claws his blindfold off and races
away over the sand

The second Insurgent is distracted for a moment by his
victim’s flight When he turns back Lyn has scooped up
the Insurgent’s GUN and is aiming it at him

Beat Nobody moves

EXT ROAD - MOMENTS LATER 94

The sun is rising as the PICK-UP TRUCK roars over the
sand and swerves onto the road

INSIDE THE TRUCK

Lyn drives Bob is leaning out of the window staring at
the road behind them

BOB

back in)
They’re not coming We’re okay Oh
God we’re gonna be okay

The Truck crests a hill and we see the IRAQI MAN running
desperately down the road ahead of us his hands tied

He puts his foot down and the truck roars after the
running man

Lyn leans out of the truck window as he drives up behind
him

We’re here to help you

Terrified the Man sprints faster Lyn tries to pass him
but the Man veers at the same time and the truck CLIPS
him sending him flying

IN THE TRUCK

LYN CASSADY (CONTD)
Oh crap

BOB

LYN CASSADY
(braking)
I think I just ran him over

EXT ROAD 95

Lyn runs over to where the MAN lies moaning on the road
his head bleeding

LYN CASSADY

give me a hand here will you

Bob gets out and the two lift the Iragi Man and begin to
carry him back towards the truck

They stop listening to an approaching rumble

BOB
Oh shit Oh shit they’re coming

They scuttle faster back towards the truck the Iraqi Man
dangling between them

Next second two GLEAMING WHITE SUVs crest the hill and
roar towards them Seeing the road blocked by the truck
the SUVs screech to a halt and several MEN IN FLAK
JACKETS AND SUNGLASSES tumble out in formation aiming
their M-16’s at Lyn and Bob

BOB
Psy for psychic

LARRY HOOPER
(Chuckling)

LARRY HOOPER (CONTD)

“American Soldier - your wives are
back home having sex with Bart
Simpson and Bert Reynolds”

at the racks of CD’s Larry notices

LARRY HOOPER (CONTD)
Howd you find us Lyn

LYN CASSADY

Larry smiles a little mockingly

BOB
If this is Psyops what are you
doing here

LARRY HOOPER
I said primarily Psyops This is a
restricted area you understand
Everything you hear and see stays
secret or you go to prison

Bob nods a little nervously

LARRY HOOPER (CONT’D)
There are individuals in the
current administration who are
looking forcreative solutions

touch with me I got in touch with
Bill

LYN CASSADY
(To Bill)
You’re working for him

Bill frowns at the CDs not seeming to hear

LARRY HOOPER
Bill’s been looking into
subliminal messaging (Selecting a
disc) This is one we’ve designed
to play to our own troops before
combat

He puts the disc in a player and presses play We hear a
burst of a period song

BOB
There’s a subliminal message in
this

LARRY HOOPER
(reading the CD)
This is”Don’t get drunk before
firing heavy machine guns” We’ve

BILL DJANGO
(Without turning)

LARRY HOOPER
You get the odd flash of what he
used to be but he’s pretty
burnt out with the booze

Larry waits until Bill has left before turning back to

Larry shakes his head in apparent sorrow Then he notices
some candy on a desk

LARRY HOOPER (CONTD)
Ooo Twizzlers

He picks it up and starts to eat it

LARRY HOOPER (CONTD)
(To Lyn)
You want one

Lyn shakes his head trying not to show the emotions he
is feeling

LARRY HOOPER (CONT’D)
(Watching him)
God I love these things

listening There is a faint sound of MUSIC coming from
somewhere nearby

INT BASE - CELL CORRIDOR - DAY 156
Lyn walks down the corridor Bob following At the end of
the corridor is a single door with a SPY-HOLE The loud
music is coming from there We can hear now that it is an
annoying children’s show song or heavy metal

We TRACK towards the door

Lyn hesitates then slides back the SPY-HOLE cover and
peers in

LYN’S POV -

An IRAQI PRISONER sits huddled in the cell illuminated
in the flashes of a powerful STROBE LIGHT OVERHEAD

SONG (0OS)
(Lyrics from chosen song )

The prisoner looks terrified and despite the whimsical
music the whole scene is horribly sinister

Lyn steps away from the spy-hole

looks troubled Bob suddenly leans into Lyn

BOB
(Softly)

BOB
Don’t eat the jello

Lyn tries to puzzle this out but is distracted by Larry
outside who seems to have noticed something in the sand
at his feet - a small insect of some kind He begins to
watch it with strange fascination After a moment he
sinks to his knees in order to get a better look at it
One of the SOLDIERS notices and starts to laugh softly
His neighbor looks at him as if he’s crazy then begins to
laugh himself Lyn looks around him sensing the strange
atmosphere creeping through the room

LYN CASSADY
What’s going on

BOB
