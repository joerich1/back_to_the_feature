Laura enters in a new pair of scrubs blocking the screen

LAURA
I have to go back in to cover
Susan’s rotation There’s a frozen
pizza in the oven Just turn it to
350 okay For twenty minutes

Max gives her a thumbs up
LAURA
I may have to stay at the hospital
in the morning If I’m not here

of chores

Max nods to get her to shut up Laura clicks off the
television and tosses him a NOTEPAD

LAURA
And no TV until you write your
apology letter

He has no idea what she’s talking about

LAURA
(frustrated)
You have to explain yourself and
read it to the judge It’s
important This isn’t a science
fair project I can’t write this
for you

She kisses him on the forehead
LAURA

I’m really trying here Max What

else can I do
Their eyes connect He doesn’t seem to know either Or he
doesn’t give a shit She exits He turns back on the TV

dropping a bomb on a stick-figure

She walks away and CRUNCH She steps on an empty beer can
There’s a half-dozen spread across the floor

Laura pulls out her PHONE

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Max opens his eyes He sees his mother speaking to a MAN on
the side of the room but Max only sees the man’s back

MAN
Well what about Robert I know my
son’s a shithead but shouldn’t he
have some weekends where he --

LAURA
Youre joking right He’s out
there still “finding himself”

MAN

for a few days
LAURA
You tell him that then But I’m
working doubles just to keep up
with everything

MAN

this trip twice a year

Suddenly Maxs view is filled with the smile of an elderly
WOMAN

This is CAROL ANDERS his GRANDMOTHER

CAROL
Someone’s awake

Max screams

CAROL
Well look who woke up on the wrong
side of the bed this morning Or

Max sits up startled The Man talking to his mother turns
This is THOMAS ANDERS his GRANDFATHER

Uh Hi
(back to Laura)
Now let’s talk about this There
has to be someone else who --

CAROL
(to Laura)

small SUITCASE next to the front door

MAX

their house on the water Remember
CAROL
Are there any books you want to

CAROL

MAX

The adults exchange glances Thomas turns on CNN He’s not
dealing with this Laura takes a seat on the couch

THOMAS

Thomas lifts the bottle of Peptobismal

THOMAS
Disengages any pains from tacos or
whatever food you eat It could
probably fix anything If I broke
my arm I’d pour it on the wound

Max puts on his headphones blocking out the sound of their
argument with something full of angst and false emotions

Max looks out the window as

A STATION WAGON drives beside them The FATHER and MOTHER in
the front seat seem to be arguing while a TEENAGE GIRL sits in the back with her sleeping younger BROTHER

Max notices the notepad sticking out of his BACKPACK

sign he turns to see

THOMAS
Well leave on the radio at least
CAROL
No music no nothing Starting

THOMAS

This is bull --

CAROL
Not Another Word

And the sound of the road fills the car Max sits back
grinning He’s going to enjoy this

LATER

Hours have passed Thomas’ lips move slightly talking to
himself Carol sits in the same position holding her own

Max sits in the back beyond bored He pulls up the UNLOCK
LATCH Considers CLICK The lock jumps down Thomas stares
at Max through the rear-view Youre not going anywhere bud

Max glances at his notebook After a moment he gives up and
begins to write

Thomas nudges Carol pointing out that Max is working Carol
is pleased with herself
LATER
CLOSE ON - LAST LINE - “Fuck you very much Max”

Max has a full page written It’s a mixture of prose
drawings that only a disturbed inmate would doodle

Max closes the binder

MAX
How far are we from Florida

Thomas clicks on the radio

THOMAS
Thank Christ

CAROL
(to Max)
Is it finished Do you want me to
look it over

MAX
How far are we

Carol stares at him for a moment Then smiles

CAROL
Well that depends on the route we
take How long would you say until
were home Thomas

THOMAS
I don’t know Fourteen maybe
fifteen hundred miles

Oh God

CAROL
(to Max)
Let’s say we go 60 miles an hour
the entire way and the trip is
1400 miles How many hours would
it take to get there

Max stares at her

THOMAS
He’s Robbie’s kid not a genius

CAROL
When I worked for the school board
this would have been answered by a
child his age

and

THOMAS
Let’s just say the gene pool in
this family can barely swim let
alone count

CAROL
(ignores him)
Come on Max How long would it --

MAX
(doesn’t care)

23 hours

CAROL
That’s right

THOMAS
It is

CAROL

Very good Max

THOMAS
Jesus Christ We’ve got Rain Man in
the back seat Hey Max do you know
how to play craps

CAROL
If you can do that so easily why
are your grades so low

Thomas eyes Max in the mirror

THOMAS
I know why He doesn’t give a shit
He’s just like his dad Thinking
that he doesn’t have to get his
hands dirty to get ahead

Max glares at Thomas for the comparison Carol shakes her
head

THOMAS
(to Carol)

What are you looking at me for
Look at him He’s probably taking
pills or something The news is
always talking about kids stealing
their parents pills and selling
them Swapping with each other on
the playground I just don’t
understand it

He trails off He tends to do that

Carol stares at Max waiting for an answer Max stares right

back

She reaches into the glove box and removes a TRAVEL GUIDE

She tosses it in the back next to Max

CAROL
You’re going to be our navigator
Were going to make stops so you
can learn something on this trip

THOMAS
We have a schedule to keep

CAROL
Oh come on Thomas When’s the
next time we can do a drive like
this with our grandson

THOMAS
Depends if I drive us off a cliff

CAROL
(ignores Thomas to Max)
You look through that and if
there’s any place you want to go

to skim the travel guide

THOMAS
Where do you buy jeans like that

YOUNG WOMAN
Excuse me

THOMAS
Those are good strong jeans Where

ten dollar bill out of her purse

CAROL
Go get us some water bottles okay

After a moment Max takes the money and exits the car Carol
goes back to watching her husband flirt with a stranger

INT CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

Max holds onto three bottles of water under his arm as he
attempts to peer through the plastic-wrapping of a porno mag
at a magazine rack It’s difficult to do without ripping the
bag so he reaches for another option

Until he turns to see he’s being watched by the GIRL from the
Station Wagon This is MEGAN Though just two years
older in Max’s eyes she’s a woman

Embarrassed Max drops the bottles of water as he tries to
return the adult magazine He quickly picks up the bottles
She waves recognizing him

Max rushes over to the line to pay Of course Megan arrives
at the same moment with a Pepsi

MEGAN
Go ahead

MAX
Okay

Max steps in front of her She rolls her eyes surprised
Max immediately regrets not letting her go first He counts
to himself working up the courage to talk to her

Through the window we see Max and Thomas high-five as they
rush toward the Lincoln

INT LINCOLN TOWN CAR - MOVING - DAY

Thomas laughs drinking his coffee He tosses an apple back
to Max Carol shakes her head

THOMAS
Lesson “Always take what you can”

CAROL
That’s an awful lesson Don’t
listen to him He’s a bitter and
cheap old man

Max bites into the apple

CAROL
(snapping)
That’s enough We’re not going to
go through this entire trip with
the two of you teaming up against
me It’s not fair

THOMAS
Alright Carol Just calm down

Carol takes a breath Thomas winks at Max in the rear-view

CAROL
(sweet)
Did you look through that travel
guide Max

Max hands her the travel guide She looks through his
earmarked pages She wrinkles her nose

CAROL
Six Flags Cedar Point Busch
Gardens

THOMAS
I could go to that last one They
give out beer samples I saw it on
History a few weeks ago
CAROL
These are amusements parks They’re
not “learning” places
Carol looks out the window Something catches her eye

CUT TO

EXT AMISH FARM - DAY
PLOP Horseshit hits the ground
An AMISH TOUR GUIDE stands next to a horse in front of a

CROWD OF TOURISTS All of the men in the tour group wear
large black Amish hats the women wear Amish bonnets

AMISH TOUR GUIDE
We here at Lancaster Farms have
been raising horses cows and
sheep since the late 1800s We hope
your wide brim hats and bonnets
help bring you a little into our
world

Max and Thomas stand in the back of the crowd about as
unhappy as an old man and early teen can be

Carol smiles taking a picture of them in their hats

AMISH TOUR GUIDE
We live the true Amish life No
electricity no cars no
television Yeah it’s not a life
for everyone but it’s the life for
us Any questions

No one in the crowd raises their hand But Carol can’t help
herself

AMISH TOUR GUIDE
Yes Ma’am

CAROL
Hello Carol Anders from Buffalo
New York What kind of products do
you make on the farm

AMISH TOUR GUIDE
There will be a small shop at the
end of the tour where you can
purchase anything from homemade
baskets to soap Now who would you
like to see how the butter is made

The Amish Tour Guide walks over to a WOODEN CRANK BUTTER
CHURNER He lifts the handle and pushes the bar up and down
It’s quite phallic

Thomas laughs Max follows suit
THOMAS
(aside to Max)
If you get me out of here I’1l
give you an extra 20

CAROL
Shush I’m trying to listen

Thomas rolls his eyes

The Amish Tour Guide begins spouting off information about
making butter But Max’s attention drifts to a small BOY who
steps to the front of the crowd

This is CODY He watches the Tour Guide’s hand with
unwavering attention

Max smiles to himself when

MEGAN steps forward and takes Cody by the hand She looks
over and sees Max She shakes her head and leads Cody over to
their parents - RON and JENNIFER CARTER (40s)

AMISH TOUR GUIDE
Now if you’ll follow me to the
stable we’ll show you the process
of removing the milk

EXT AMISH STORE - DAY

basket with other hats To the side of the store is Megan

THOMAS

Bullshit like that

Max looks over his shoulder Megan smiles at him She can
hear everything Max turns red

Megan waves at Max as she enters her family’s car

CAROL
Surprise

Carol appears with newly purchased AMISH HATS

CAROL
To remember the stop

Both men exhale as she places them on their heads

Carol hesitates watching the pair in their new hats walk
toward the Lincoln She smiles to herself then follows

INT LINCOLN TOWN CAR - MOVING - DAY

Thomas drives listening to TALK RADIO Something about
stocks Carol sleeps in the front seat

Max listens to music on his iPod He looks out his window to
see Megan’s Station Wagon pull alongside again Inside Ron
and Jennifer talk in the front seat In the back is Cody
singing and Megan bored

Max waves at her She motions “one second” and begins to
write something

She presses a new paper SIGN against her window It reads
“302-415-7921 TEXT ME”

Max quickly dials her number into his phone The Station
Wagon speeds up and passes the Lincoln

Max adds Megan’s number to his phone He types into his
phone NOTE Text Messages are in italics

checks his phone

defending their country

CAROL
Youre thinking of Williamsburg

THOMAS
I know exactly what I mean They do
war things at these fairs

CAROL
You don’t understand what he wants
to see

THOMAS

Maybe you don’t want to understand
what I’m trying to say for him to
learn about

CAROL
You’re not making any sense

THOMAS
Jesus H Christ Carol

Carol glares at him Until finally she crosses her arms and

turns away from Thomas

CAROL
(matter-of-fact)
There is no ‘H’ in my Savior’s
name

That ends their fight Silence

Max sits back in his seat Anxious

EXT RENAISSANCE FAIR - ENTRANCE - DAY

A LARGE MAN is dressed like an EXECUTIONER covered head-to-
toe in LEATHER eating a TURKEY LEG

Thomas stares at the leather outfit while tying his shoe
He’s somewhat fixated on the Executioner’s belly like he’s
in a trance A piece of turkey lands on Thomas’ foot

THOMAS
You gotta be shitting me

Carol taps him on the head

Thomas stands REVEALING our trio in a long line They stand
out like a sore thumb - they’re the only ones not in costume

CAROL
Shush We just got here And look
how excited he is

Max looks down the line for Megan and her family She’s not
here yet

THOMAS
(to Max)
Why did you want to go to this

The line begins to move forward They approach the TICKET
BOOTH Thomas reads the sign “MARYLAND RENAISSANCE PLEASURE
FAIR”

THOMAS
What the hell

A TICKET OPERATOR stands behind a table in a COURT JESTER
outfit He clearly just received his Acting MFA and the
world is his stage He would be too much even for Disneyland

TICKET OPERATOR
Welcome to the Maryland Renaissance
Pleasure Fair Would you like to be
Royal or Street

THOMAS
(blank)

TICKET OPERATOR
Royalty tickets include meals and
rides while Street tickets just
include entry

THOMAS
Just give me the goddamn tickets

Carol curtsies - getting into character

CAROL
Why we are Royal of course

TICKET OPERATOR
My A Queen is with us today

THOMAS
(under his breath)
She’s not the only one

The Ticket Operator breaks character and stares at Thomas

TICKET OPERATOR
That will be 3575 each

THOMAS
Retired discount

TICKET OPERATOR
(back into character)
Sorry sir During the Renaissance
era there were no discounts for
anyone Especially for Royalty

Thomas rolls his eyes while Carol pulls out a Visa card

TICKET OPERATOR
I’m sorry ma’am We did not have
cards during the Renaissance
Everything is true to the period

THOMAS
I’m sure you accept American
dollars

TICKET OPERATOR
Yes sir

THOMAS
That makes a lot of sense

Carol pays the Ticket Operator and they head into the Fair
Max looks back at the crowd hoping to spot Megan

Defeated Max heads back toward the bench His phone buzzes

Megan points to Ron and Jennifer fighting as they argue over
a park map Cody wears a CHILD’S LEASH that is connected from
his chest to a bracelet around Jennifer’s wrist
MEGAN

She’s pissed Clearly I don’t

care Come on Let’s go They won’t

MEGAN

She looks him over
MEGAN

Few more years you could be cute

Max sits up a little Confidence coming back She notices and
starts laughing at him

MEGAN
You remind me of this boy from
school Will Gordon He always
tries to act cool too The “cool
quiet” type But everyone knows
it’s just an act

Max looks down at the ground

MEGAN
Truth or Dare

MAX
- Truth

MEGAN
Only pussies pick truth

MAX
Fine Dare

MEGAN
You already said truth Hmm

She enjoys toying with him

MEGAN
(leans forward)
Have you ever been kissed

Here comes the flop-sweat Now Max is really nervous But he
tries to cover

MAX
Yeah

MEGAN
More than once

Max a little high can’t hide the truth He turns red She
laughs Then moves a little closer

MEGAN
We’ve all had first ones But have
you had a good one

Max reaches for the joint not wanting to answer She pulls
it away and takes a hit herself

Megan holds the smoke in her mouth and leans toward Max She
puffs her lips He leans forward and before their lips
touch

She blows the smoke into his mouth Max pulls back coughing

MEGAN
It’s easier to take it that way

Max can’t hide his disappointment Megan puts out the joint
and pockets it for later

MEGAN
Come on

Off Max’s glazed smile

SERIES OF SHOTS

Max and Megan ride a ferris wheel go-karts and various
other rides that do not make any sense being at a Renaissance
Fair They’re high and enjoying themselves Everything is a
little slower than it should be A little more colorful

More importantly we catch glimpses of Max looking at Megan
Her laugh her smile her eyes

He’s falling for her
END SERIES OF SHOTS AS

Max and Megan walk toward a new ride when a HAND grabs Max’s
shoulder

THOMAS
That’s three strikes THREE

Thomas notices that Max’s eyes are incredibly red

Say goodbye to your girlfriend
Max

Thomas grabs Max by the shoulder and leads him toward the
Fairground’s exit Max walks backwards watching Megan go the
opposite direction

glass objects by her feet Thomas drags Max directly to
Carol

THOMAS
This isn’t working out I thought

all of my time playing baby-sitter
I look forward to these trips

CAROL

better
(to Carol)
I love you

CAROL
(heart melting)
I love you too And we’ll have a

She tousles his hair

CAROL
Can you put this in the car for me

She hands the bag of glass objects to Max He seems a little
disoriented by the task He can’t open the door and hold the
bag at the same time He’s too high

Thomas pulls Carol a few feet away from the car while Max in
the background tries to get the bag inside

THOMAS
Twice a year we do this drive
together It’s the highlight of the
year for me You know that

CAROL
I do not understand why this is
such a problem for you He’s been
fine aside from the kidnapping
thing

Max lifts the heavy bag and heaves it onto roof of the car
But the large bag CRASHES through the SUNROOF

Thomas and Carol watch shocked
MAX
(just as surprised)
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh balls

on his phone and slowly crawls off his cot He’s still
dressed from dinner

From his view his Grandparents both appear to be asleep Max

to make his outline under the covers

Max slowly opens the door and successfully sneaks out

and Dad Cody’s always with
Jennifer though He’s only my half-

ocean She steals Maxs

MEGAN

wanted to ‘backpack for a year’
That he never did it after high
school and regretted it

MEGAN
So he’s homeless

MAX
No Well I don’t think so

MEGAN
Do you talk to him

Max shakes his head

MEGAN
At least you don’t have to see him
anymore

Max doesn’t know what to say to comfort her Maybe it’s the
small amount of alcohol but

MAX
I threw a trash can onto the
principal’s car

Megan bursts out laughing

MEGAN
Why did you do that

MAX
(truthful)
I don’t know

MEGAN
You really want to be a bad guy

her head so she can see

here How’d you like to stay at the
beach a few days Max

Carol looks up from her plate at Thomas

THOMAS
What can I say I like it here

THOMAS
This is the last straw He’s been
trying to ruin this entire trip so

Max squirms out of Thomas’s grip He doesn’t run away though
He stands firm

THOMAS

THOMAS
How late were you out

Thomas waits looking for the words For the first time he
opens himself up to Max Wanting an honest answer

THOMAS
What do you think you know Max

MAX
I know you’re not going to tell me
what to do ever again

THOMAS
Excuse me

MAX
(mimicking Thomas)
“Youre going to keep your mouth
shut do as your told and we’re
going to have fun on this trip Do
you understand”

THOMAS
Are you threatening me you little
shit

MAX

Hey Grams I think I saw something
in Room 204 Do you wanna --

THOMAS
Jesus Christ

Thomas sits on the side of the bed Overwhelmed He rubs his
temples

THOMAS
Youre a prick just like your dad

Max’s eyes burn with anger Thomas looks away regretful for
that statement

After a moment Thomas grabs his keycard and heads for the
door He stops at the handle his back to Max

THOMAS
One day It’s complicated Life
isn’t as easy

Thomas gives up And exits

Max listens to Thomas’s footsteps head down the hall Then
lays back on the bed

Max doesn’t reach for his headphones or turn on the TV He
lets the silence of the room surround him

KNOCK KNOCK
Max goes to the door and opens it’s Megan

She rushes past and sits on the side of the bed She looks
like she’s seen a ghost

MEGAN
I didn’t tell them about last
night I promise

Max closes the door and watches her lay down on the bed This
is the only time he’s been alone with a girl He’s nervous

MEGAN
They were awake

MAX
So they caught you sneaking in

MEGAN
I opened the door and it was
quiet So I thought hey I’m

She pops up

MEGAN
She was on top of the sink riding
my Dad Backwards

MAX

She lays back on the bed covering her eyes with her arms

MEGAN
I opened the door and they just
stared at me What the fuck

MAX
Wait What about --

MEGAN
Cody I’ll get to him Jen screamed
at me “Close the door Close the

saw them and screamed He’s been
drawing pictures of them all

Max sits on the side of the bed just a few feet away from
her

MEGAN
Did you talk to your Cheat-Machine

Max shakes his head She sits up

MEGAN
What is this place Some kind of
sex center

MAX
(trying to play it cool)
Ha yeah

She rests her head on his shoulder

MEGAN
I never want to be an ‘adult’ It
doesn’t make any sense

MAX
- Maybe it’s good that they were
uh you know Maybe they’re happy
again

MEGAN
But they don’t love each other
It’s just all they have sex
doesn’t mean anything It’s just
something two people do when
they’re alone

Silence fills the room Theyre all alone

Megan lifts her head and their eyes connect She looks
confident he’s probably sweating If he spoke now his voice
would

CA-CRACK

A KEYCARD is inserted in the front door They jump to their
feet as the door opens to REVEAL a

MAID
Oh I’m sorry I thought the room
was empty I’1ll come back later

Max watches the Maid and her pushcart’s shadow pass the
window toward the next room He goes to the door and sees

Max looks down the hall and notices a “Do Not Enter” hangtag
on Room 204’s doorhandle

Megan adjusts her hair and sits back down on the bed Acting
like an adult crossing her leg and leaning back She’s not
sure what’s she’s doing but does it anyway

Ron downs his drink and orders a round for both of them Then

(with a wink)
Ever anything on the side

Without hesitation Thomas shakes his head

RON

Never Shit Jennifer’s my second

Thanks for the drink

Thomas exits the bar and heads outside Ron calls back to

doesn’t nod It’s just a passive glance Max looks down at
the pool

Thomas goes back into the room

Megan puts her hand on his hand Trying to be comforting A
friend
MAX QUICKLY LEANS IN AND KISSES HER

Shocked she pushes him INTO THE POOL Max jumps up from
under the water

be the moment to kiss me

Max is confused Hurt Until

INT CHURCH - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Around a dozen friends and family are seated around the
conference table as a LAWYER (40s) sits at the center
speaking to the crowd A SMALL BOX rests on the table in
front of him

And then at the end of the table is Carol and Thomas She’s
composed he looks like hell Several people in the room
stare at them during the meeting unsure who they are

Max sits a few feet behind his Grandparents in a chair by
the door He types into his phone

MAX (TEXT)

Deciding whether to send But Carol startles Max and his
thumb hits SEND

CAROL
(whispers to Max)
Put your phone away dear Don’t be

We we were acquaintances

The Middle-Aged Woman nods unsure who they are
LAWYER

And lastly is there a Mr and
Mrs Thomas and Carol Anders in

attendance
CAROL
Yes
LAWYER

Alright then

He uses his pen to open a sealed ENVELOPE Carol and Thomas
ready themselves for the worst The crowd watches with
curiosity

The Lawyer READS from a letter with a dry monotone voice

LAWYER
“Carol”

Carol and Thomas sit up in their seats shocked They did not
expect for the letter to be addressed to her

LAWYER
“I cannot express the guilt that I
have felt over the years A real
woman would have spoken to you
Told you the truth I do not think
there is any way I can make up for
what I have done to you”

Everyone in the room’s mouth drops
Carol looks at her husband He can’t meet her eyes

LAWYER
“Thomas was the love of my life but
he would never come home to me or
build me a house or have children
with me”

Max’s phone BUZZES He ignores it

LAWYER
“IT know that there is nothing I can
give to make up for what I may have
done to your marriage but I hope
you find this as a token of my good
will”

The Lawyer leans forward and hands Carol a sealed envelope
Everyone watches as Carol considers opening it but instead
places it in her purse

LAWYER
(to Thomas )
Ms Miller did not leave a letter
for you Mr Anders

The Lawyer opens the cardboard BOX and removes a LARGE
BINDER

LAWYER
But she left you this

The Lawyer hands Thomas your average black three-ring binder
The crowd watches as Thomas opens the binder

Inside are DOZENS of PLASTIC SLEEVE PAGES that one would
normally use to collect baseball cards However in this
binder are ROOM KEYS Every room key from every evening they
spent together

The opening of the binder shows actual metal keys As Thomas
flips through the pages the metal keys transition into
electronic keycards Each representing a different hotel room
and conversely a different drive down the coast with Carol

Max watches as Thomas closes the binder and wipes tears from
his eyes Carol looks away from him

EXT CHURCH - DAY

follows his Grandparents toward the car The envelope pokes
out of Carol’s purse

MAX
Are you okay

She miles and goes back to watching Thomas

MAX
Uhm I know we haven’t spent much

Go ahead

They watch from the sand as Thomas in his shoes and pants
walks KNEE HIGH into the ocean

They can’t make out what he says but Thomas speaks to the
binder He holds it close to his chest

Thomas drops the binder into the ocean and it quickly sinks

Max watches Carol closely Without taking her eyes off
Thomas Carol pulls the ENVELOPE from her purse TEARS IT
and lets the pieces fall into the sand

Thomas walks back toward his wife Carol steps ahead of Max
toward her husband

Carol SLAPS him hard across the face (opposite side of his
black eye) Thomas takes it They stare at each other for a
moment Max is unsure what will happen next He watches as

They kiss

His Grandparents wrap their arms around each other and truly
kiss Max’s jaw drops He can’t take it anymore

MAX
Are you fucking kidding me

They look over at him

MAX
You have got to be fucking kidding

for years Did you see how many
keys were in that book

Carol and Thomas share a look

Carol and Thomas look at each other
CAROL
He is an asshole You’re right

Thomas looks down at the sand There’s a silence between
them The BINDER washes up onto the beach They all notice

Carol heads toward the car Max and Thomas watch her leave

THOMAS
(softly)
Look This is my one chance kid
I don’t get it either but Help
me out We’re family

Max looks at him blankly Thomas appears sincere Max can’t
decide what to do Thomas catches up to Carol and holds her
hand

MAX
What the fuck is going on

Max watches as the couple quietly walk together toward the
car holding hands He places his hands in his pocket and is
surprised to find the Room 204 keycard Considers

He walks over to the washed-ashore binder and begins to dig a
hole in the sand to bury the binder

CAROL
Cause everything else is bullshit

Max is speechless She begins to exit the car
