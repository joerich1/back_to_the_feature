the ignition But before he can turn it --

- a HAND reaches in through his open window and snatches the

keys Sam whirls and sees --

Max Cady in his tight Hawaiian shirt Sam stiffens

CADY
Free as a bird apparently You go

Could it be you don’t remember me

SAM
Sure Last night You --

CADY
I’m disappointed Hurt

SAM
I would like my keys --

CADY
Max Cady You look the same Maybe
ten pounds heavier --

Sam abruptly reaches for his keys -- but Cady’s faster and
the keys remain dangling just out of Sam’s reach

CADY
I read that the average man gains ten

pounds every ten years till he’s sixty
Me I dropped ten pounds the first ten

years of my sentence
(beat then)
Maybe that means I’m not average

And now Sam remembers

He rattles

‘Cause it’s a struggle to stay healthy
in the joint You’re white they stick

my only vice I needed a vice in the
joint to remind me I was human

Sam strains to sound curious net at all confrontational

SAM
Have you been following me

CADY
Small town Everywhere I turn

He shrugs in ostensible chagrin Sam starts his car again
He wants his parting words to sound vaguely like a warning

SAM
Take care Mr Cady

Cady responds -- but what he says is drowned by the Volvo’s
engine Sam thinks he heard but he can’t be sure

SAM
w- What

But Cady is already moving lithe as a cat back to his Ford

But when I reached out to pet him he
gmashad his teeth at me viciously --
then he started howling Horrible
high-pitched howls More like screams
Denny ran in I called the vet Then
it was like he was winding down
winding down like a clock

Beneath her subdued speech there is a rage percolating

KAREN
And then he stopped His eyes were
still wide open He died maybe a
minute before the vet came The vet
took his body away
(e faint laugh)
He just barely fit in the back seat

Sam is silent for a moment Then softly

don’t cotten to dog-killers Trouble
is poisoning a dog is just a fine So
what well do well “uncover” other --
problems F’r instance an ex-con
on early release has to register with
City Hall Chances are Cady didn’t do
that If he’s unemployed he’s got to
show considerable savings Basically
we find so many ways on the books to
lean on an undesirable he‘ll feel
about as welcome here as a case of
Yellow Fever

INT ID ROOM MORNING
A small darkened theater with a large window facing onto an
adjacent room for line-ups Elgart takes a seat in front of
the window Unwraps a square of Beech Nut chewing tobacco
- ELGART

Youll ID ‘im Well do a full bod

strip search Jerk a knot in his tail
He gives Sam a conspiratorial smile

Sam the lawyer isn’t entirely comfortable with the concept
of an unnecessary strip search -- but he’s with the progrs

’ SAM
« Alright

Simultaneously a door in the line-up room opens and Max Cady
is huetled in not gently -- by two Uniformed Officers

ELGART
That him

Cady’s eyes eweep the room and land on “he window He seems
to be looking directly at Sam -- who shifts uncomfortable

ELGART
One-way mirror Mr Bowden He doesn’t
KknoW youre back here

Sam turns away from the window to Lieutenant Elgart

SAM
Yeah That’s him

In the line-up room they’ve instructed Cady to remove ris
clothes He does so Slowly deliberately defiantly
but he’s teasing too like a Chippendale’s stripper
Perhaps prison cured him of his modesty or he won‘t be
humiliated Either way he has nothing to be ashamed of

Both Sam and Elgart are quietly stunned by Cady’s physique
Elgart’s hand holding the square of chewing tobacco is
frozen at his mouth

Now fully naked Cady stands facing the one-way mirror on
his face is a smirk that says You like what you see

ELGART
Jeez Couldn’t hurt that with an ax

There is a KNOCK -- a young Detective enters
DETECTIVE
We searched Cedy’s apartment Car
registration’s in order No gun or
other weapons We found these

He hands over two items to Elgart (Through the window out

of focus now Cady’s strip-search has begun) Elgart grunts

SAM
o- What

Elgert waves Item 1 a receipt from the City of New Essex

ELGART
He registered with City Hall
Elgart inspects Item 2 a bank passbook Then hands it
over to Sam

ELGART
He might could be better off in cDd’s
-s but I’m afraid that’s no crime

SAM
(scans the passbook)
«es Twenty-thousand dollars

(2

ef
aw

DETECTIVE
Says his mother died while he was
serving Farm got sold off Cady got
the proceeds

SAM
SO where does that leave us

ELGART
Very least we nail him for the dog
Now what happened You let the dog
out Cady abducted ‘im --

SAM
We didn’t let him out

ELGART
Well If Cady came into your home
that’s illegal entry with intent --

SAM
He didn’t come into our home

Elgart looks confused Then how did Cady poison your dog

SAM
I don’t know how he did it I just
know he did it Somehow

Elgart doesn’t look happy He glances out at Cady’s strip
search Then turns back to Sam and studies him Finally

ELGART
It’s a holiday Mr Bowden
Shouldn’t you be with your family

CUT TO
EXT MAIN STREET - LATE MORNING

The sidewalk is jammed for the New Essex Independence Day
Parade At the moment the county’s finest vintage cars are
slowly being driven down the street by their proud owners

Karen and Sam slowly thread their way through the throng

SAM
They said if he spits on the sidewalk
it‘ll cost him a hundred bucks He
drives one mile over the speed limit
they’11 pull him over

KAREN
Swill but if he doesn’t spit or drive
too fast we have to Live with ted

te
vay

SAM
But he will One way or another
sooner rather than later he‘ll screw
up Sheriff says they always do
And then he’ll get the message in no
uncertain terms

KAREN
Okay Maybe that’s fine Id still
like to blast that bastard right
between the eyes

They stake out an unclaimed patch of sidewalk and watch as a
Deusenberg then a Cord Roadster cruises by

SAM
That’s a Cord from the ‘30s See the
coffineshaped nose

As each beauty passes the heads of the onlookers swivel to
follow ‘then turn back to focus on the next automobile

SAM

A Bugatti and a Phaeton I think
ANGLE
There is one face in the crowd that hasn’t turned SLOW PUSH
IN on Max Cady looking straight ahead seeming not even 5
blink Still wearing that smirk

BACK TO KAREN AND SAM

As they reactto the Kissel car that passes

SAM
Look rumble seats on the fenders

And now he notices Cady across Main Street a peacock in his
Hawaiian shirt baldly staring Sam’s smile congeals
SAM
Sonovobitch

Now Karen sees too She instinctively olutches Sam

KAREN
That’s him He‘’s staring at us

SAM
He’s staring at you

Not sure quite how he’s going to handle this -- but sure he
uas to do something -- Sam disengages himself from Karen and
¢ j Carts across the Street in between cars toward Cady

Who blithely continues to stare at Karen
Now Sam is rignt in Cady’s face

SAM
What do you think you‘’re dcing

Cady casually raises his chin just an inch so as to peer
over Sams shoulder at Sams wife Sam tabs his shoulder

SAM
Godammit I’m talking to you

Finally Cady turns to him With a coy infuriating grin

CADY
Just admiring a very pratty chassis

And Sam snaps He swings a fist at Cady’s jaw But Cady is
quicker -- he ducks the punch then drops into the street
curled into a ball arms protectively folded over his head

CADY
-- Help me

Momentarily bewildared Sam blinks at Cady on the ground

Suddenly some well-meaning Spectator grabs him from behind
Sam instinctively jerks free And Cady cries

CADY
(I didn’t do anything

Two more Spectators work to restrain a still-struggling San
Other concerned Bystanders help Cady to his feet The ex-con
faultlessly feigns unsteadiness and shock Karen meanwhile
is now grappling and pleading with the three men holding San

CADY
Iwas just standing here just
watching the nica parade

Cady is encouraged to walk away He does so all the while
murmuring expressions of fright and dismay

ANGLE - DANNY

notices the nearby disturbance and is naturally drawn to it

Seeing that her parents are at the core of the melee she
breaks into a wild sprint

As she reaches them citizens move away and darkly mutter
Did you see He just attacked the poor man Almost got him
killed What is he crazy
As we CRANE UP and UP above the chaos the discordant sounds
slowly FADE OUT and we HEAR OVER

From OFF-SCREEN we hear the person she’s conversing with

Max Cady sits on the next stool He’s traded his tight

Hawaiian shirt for something loose in black rayon

CADY

Cady sips his Evian Lori appraises the attractive stranger

LORI

CADY

This gives Lori a moment’s pause Then she laughs

CADDY

CADY
There was this protest march on this
nuclear power plant When they came to

rough with the lady behind me I
cold-cocked the little bastard

He makes a face dumb huh
Lori smiles Then turns and signals the bartender

LORI

Cady puts his hand on her arm Gentle but emphatic

CADY

CADY

Cady lights up a cigar

CADY

Oh yeah right I’m gonna sleep with

LORI
No I told you We never

Now Cady sharply pinions both of Lori’s arms behind her

CADY
He hurt you like this

LORI

No He didn’t hurt me physically --

Cady reaches into his coat strewn on a chair by the bed
pulls out a pair of handcuffs

New Essex proper You work hara but
you live in a fancy suburb ten miles

The subdued tone and use of Sam’s first name quiets Sam

KERSEK

The system is set up pretty well to
handle generalized routine dangers
robbery burglacy crimes of greed
and opportunity But if one lone
nutcase cut there targets you for some
obscure reason the system is slow
skeptical pathetic even Which
is bad for you But fortunate for me

His grin is modest yet supremely eelf-assured

Now what’s your connection with this
fella

SAM
I was his lawyer His public defender

A ceat Kersek squints at Sam

But you shafted him somenow -- yes

Well

Karen doesn’t respond the fight seems tc have drained out of
her She sits on the bed ‘

SAM
But I think and this scares me z
think Cady knew shed refuse to testify
‘cause she knows the system And that
youd draw the conclusion you drew
which would create a rift between us
And wed be that much more vulnerable

Cady lowers the paper

KERSEK
Cady I’ve been in a real down mood
these last couple days Shame huh

Cady raises his eyebrows

KERSEK
You want a tip as to how you could help
brighten my mood

Cady’s look is so neutral it’s comic Kersek though is
clearly unamused

KERSEK
I don’t want you hanging around
anymore And I don’t just mean around
town I don’t want to get word you’re
anywhere in this whole beautiful state

Finally Cady responds a studied mellowness to his tons

CADY
Are you my friend

Kersek takes a step forward into Cady’s personal space

KERSEK
Now why would I be your friend Max

CADY
(patiently)
Because I plan my Comings and goings
with friends But if you’re not my
friend and you’re planning my comings
and goings I’d call that presumptuous
And I’d call that rude

KERSEK

LOO Gosh I’m sorry if Ive offended you
NAA beat)
Fuckface

Kersek tenses hoping Cady will take a swing Instead

CADY
It’s met necessary to call me a name
It could make me uoset things could
get out of hand And then in self-
defense could kill you right here

KERSEK
(easy grin)
You’re welcome to try

CADY
Are you muscling me

KERSEK
’ Wow You’re a guick study Max

CADY
Beceuse I’m well within my rights to be
here And if I stay here what are you
gonna do What are you gonna do Are

L you gonna arrest me Are you a cop
CD
Neu Kersek doesn’t answer his easy grin tightens a ted

CADY
Were you a cop Were you not good
enough to remain on the force ecause
that’s the feeling I’m getting here

Kersek looks as though he’d like to take e bite out of Cady’s
heed Instead he forces himself to walk away with a final

KERSEK
Watch your ass Max

GRACTELLA

DANNY
Ma neither Maybe it’s just these

grabby corporations Dad represents
just puts something bad into the air

She fills a bag starts on another one
DANNY
Or have you noticed that whan things
get too good there’s a thing inside
people makes them want to wreck it
Graciella smiles as she rises and dusts off her hands
GRACIELLA
Like the trouble you get into with the
marijuana
Danny doesn’t answer -- she busies herself with the beans

GRACIELLA
Because it is easier to be unhappy

Danny’s quickly filled another bag

DANNY

KERSEK
Not my damn fault Cady was

expecting to be covered So ali I’ve
been getting is cuteness Last night
he sends me a bettle of champagne at
this fancy-ass roadhouse he frequents
Today he spends four hours at the
public library Sucker just sat
there four hours reading Thus Spake
Zarathustra by Friedrich Nietzsche

Sam looks incredulous Friedrich Nietzsche

KERSEK
German philosopher God is dead

Sam gives out with a dark laugh

SAM
Tell me

KERSEK
Good news is he won’t try anything
while I’m watching him Bad news is
this goes on and on - the champagne
the library the cuteness -- and
nothing gets settied Which quickly
gets to be an exorbitant proposition

SAM

Look days I’m not so concerned about
Stay on him a few more nights willya

As he climbs out of his car a BIG MAN steps from the shadows
behind him

Oh Max

Cady whirls -- and takes a length of pipe to the kidneys He
yelps and reels back --

-- into the grip of BIG MAN 2 who’s appeared from out of
nowhere As Cady struggles to get free --

-- BIG MAN 3 materializes snapping a bicycle chain‘at Cady’s
chest shredding’ his shirt drawing blood

ANGLE SAM

stands thirty yards away half-hidden by the wall of a dark
alley He intently watches his face a taut mask

Cady is like a gered bull ringed by toreadors -- he staggers

bent and bloedy as the Big Men continue to punish him their
swats and wallops almost gratuitous now

BACK TO SAM

He’s watched quite enough he starts away But with his back
turned he doesn’t see

BACK TO THE BEATING
Big Man 1 closing in for anether round with the pipe And
abruptly Cady thrusts his head forward and viciously CONKS

Big Man 1 in the face expicding his nose

As Big Man 1 collapses Cady wrests the pipe from his hand
gracefully spins and then brutally brings it down on the

skull of Big Man 2 whe instantly topples as though dead

Which leaves Big Man 3 - the guy with the bicycle chain --
whe savagely swings his lethal metal whip at Cady --

-- and Cady howling with pain and exhilaration catches the
end of the chain and yanks it out of Big Man 3’s grip

BACK TO SAM
Who stands frozen shocked at this inconceivable reversal

He swings the bicycle chain like a lassce whipping it down in
great deadly dips at Big Man 3 --

o- who finally takes off running like a jackrabbit

BACK TO SAM

Now it’s just him and Cady alone in the night Holding his
breath Sam starts to quickly creep away only to
accidentally kick an empty can that’s lying in the alley
The can hideclsly CLANGS Sam freezes again And HEARS

CADY’S VOICE
Counselor
ANGLE CADY

Still twirling the bicycle chain drunk on adrenalin He
lureches here and there SHOUTING

CADY
Come out come cut wherever you are

Assorted neighbors SHOLT fer Cady to shut up but he’s c
some psycho-endorphin high and he’s blissfully ecblivicus --

BACK TO SAM
Straining to hear Cady’s footsteps He’s coming closer
his voice much louder Sam clenches his fists in case

(God forbid) it should come to that --

CADYS VOICE
Every good man’s gotta wrestle with the
devil

Sam ducks behind a thick utility pole -- just as Cady starts
down the alley He finally stops twirling the chain so that
he can light up a cigar

CADY
Whod you take me for Jethro Bodine
Few whacks in my good ol’ boy gut and
Tim back to Tobacco Road Counselor
I listen to opera I read the
hil

metaphysical osophers I drink

gallons of goldan Mineral water
Hes so close Sam can smell his smoke As Cady prowls Sam
takes a step around the utility pole adjusting the angle so
he’s invisible to Cady Cady’s senses are super-stimulated
- he knows Sam is right around here He edges closer --—

-- and Sam takes another step around that pole to stay out
of sight But he doesn’t see that if he takes just one more

blind step he’s going to kick another empty can --

“- and Cady Closes in -«
“- and Sam slowly lifts his foot to take that fatal step --
“- and then Cady chucks away his fuming cigar and sighs

CADY
Fuck it

And retreats into the dark At last Sam empties his lungs

Or best case you manage to shoot Cady
dead Vengeance is mine you say as

an unforseeable act of god that cancels

We HEAR Lieutenant Elgart’s VOICE over the phone line as he
indignantly responds Sam hangs up in mid-tirade

one powerful arm Sam violently thrashes -- manages to give
Cady a good poke in the eye - but Cady’s got him ina
chokehoid and he finally goes limp
Cady cradling Sam in his arms pats his head Softly
CADY
I’ve been worried counselor Worried

His hand finds Kersek 38 in Sam’s pants Cady clucks his
tongue -- naughty boy -- as he pulls it out examines it

Another heavy sheet of rain pelts the cabin Karen crosses

But just as she reaches the door Cady drops down a spider
The eye Sam hit is bloodshot and already swelling making
Cady look even more dangerous

Cady improvises a little bow and a new opening line

what’a down in this ghastly cramped space the hot water

As the craft tosses the severed anchor line is knocked over

in again and Karen must abandon her position near the lamp -

raises the knife up to the floorboards trying to follow the
shadows -- but they’re moving too fast both sets of feet are
too close together it’s too risky then tha shadows part
again and Danny thinks she knows which footsteps sounded
heavier She carefully inserts the blade into the crack
between the boards « can she take the chance A beat of
indecision - then she squeezes shut her eyes and whispers

DANNY
Please god please god please god

Then she drives the blade up through the floor --

The houseboat rocks and Cady maintaining his balance shifts
his foot and avoids the blade by an inch as it thrusts up

As the boat wildly pitches in the storm the dangling line
finally drops down into Sams outstretched straining hand

Karen backs into the lower berth then falls onto it Cady
is on top of her eagerly groping like a high school kid

Meantime Karen’s free hand inches toward the back pocket of
Cady’s pants the pocket with Kersek’s gun stuck in it
But just as her fingertips graze the Charter’s butt

-- Cady abruptly stands

CADY
Excuse’ me Mrs 8 but you see «- and
pleasa don’t take umbrage but in

formulated you are basically a -«
how do I put this Warmup Exercise

He backs to the hatch Somewhat breathless from the clinch

CADY
My concept is that I will -- initiate
your daughter into the mysteries
while youwatch Thet okay Or does
it sound a bit on the barbaric side

Keren’s mind is racing

CADY
Frankly I think you’ll enjoy it We
‘id this a lot in prison and it really
s waally brings out the voyeur in a
person to observe two other people
mating Something very basic very
thrilling perhaps because it’s taboo

Now out of her mouth just one word

Karen nods again Cady slides the cigar into his mouth and
flicks on the lighter

His kerosene-soaked shirt goes up like a torch

Just before the flames engulf his head Cady stares at Karen
with a sad little-boy-lost expression

Then he bolts afire from the waist up out of the cabin --

EXT DECK - NIGHT - LATER

Sam steers the houseboat into the waves Bent on getting his
family home oblivious to the lashing wind -- a hero at last

And then something catches his eye He turns away from his
task for an instant to grimly consider --

- the anchor line that had dropped over the side earlier
ItS been hanging down the hull all this time an invitation

It makes Sam very unhappy

At the first opportunity he leaves the wheel to inspect the
‘line He bends down and with a sense of dread gives it a
tug -- is anyone holding on below ‘

Sam is pleased to find that the line pulls up quite easily
nothing nobody is attached He straightens back up --

-- amd a gun barrel is pressed into his ear OS we HEAR

CADY’S VOICE
The people call Samuel G Bowden

INT CABIN «- A MOMENT LATER
Cady waves the gun at Karen and Danny

CADY
You’re the jury

In the weak flickering light of the kerosene lantern Cady’s
puffy welted face looks especially horrific

He pushes Sam onto a chair
CADY
And I’m the prosecutor How does that
sound -
Everyone nervously nods at Cady sounds fine
Now Cady turns and starts in on Sam with a fierce

Do you swear to tell the truth and
nothing but tne truth so help you God

CADY

your civic duty You’re the jury
Danny sinks back down

If only to defuse the situation Sam raises his right hand

SAM
Okay I swear to tell the truth What
do you want to know

As the houseboat plunges downriver Cady begins the “cross-
examination of his former defense attorney

CADY
Mr Bowden Who was Richard Lehman

When Sam fails to answer immediately Cady swats the gun
across his face Sam moans Karen and Danny both ery out

Cady looks up at a judge that only he can see
CADY

was argumentative
He turns back to San

He was the investigator who wrote up a

She starts to spring at Cady but Danny holds her back
Cady’s oblivious « he’s arguing with the judge

CADY
Because he’s perjuring himself Your

said
(at Sam)
Don’t you

Now in a monotone as he massages his badly bruised jaw

SAM
It said she was “promiscuous” It said
shed had three different lovers in one
month alone prier to the rape

CADY
That’s right At least three And did
you show this report to the prosecuting
attorney

SAM
No

The houseboat shudders Cady pays no attention

CADY

No You didn’t It wasn’t in the file
‘you turned over to me either I only
discovered it after I petitioned to
represent myself five years into my
sentence When I finally got my hands’
on the court file there it was But
back in ‘80 you buried it counselor
Would you care to tell the jury why

Sam wearily turns to the jury his wife and daughter

SAM
Because I knew he’d brutally raped her

th

CADY
(enraged)
Talk to me I’m standing here --

Sam turns to Cady No fear in his eyes now Simply

SAM
The fact she was promiscuous didn’t
changa that And you’d bragged to me
that youd beaten two prior aggravated
rapas You ware a menaca

CADY
You were my lawyer That report
could’ve savea me fourteen years
SAM
Youre probably right

CADY
You self-righteous fuck

He goes for Sams face again with the gun-butt But the
houseboat bumps hard against the bank and Cady misses

Regardless the third-degrae continues

CADY
Counselor Please quote for me the
American Bar Association’s rules of
professional conduct in this area

SAM
(beat then)
A lawyer is obligated by the rules of
ethics to dafend --

CADY
Nee to zealously defend his client
within the Bounds of the law And rt
find you guilty counsalor

His blistered face is turning obscenely red with rage

oe CADY

Guilty of abrogating your oath Guilty
of 2yeaing me of selling me out andi
sentence you

Suddenly in his free hand Cady is waving handcuffs -- the
same heavy cuffs he‘d used on Lori Davis

CADY
I sentence you to learn about loss
He snaps one cuff onto the pole that supports the houseboat’s
roof
CADY

Loss of freedom Dignity Humanity
Now you and I will truly be the same

He yanks Sam to his feet Confides

CADY
Don’t fret counselor You’re halfway
to heaven

As he starts to lock the other cuff around Sam‘’s wrist the
houseboat slams into the riverbank and everyone and
everything (including Kerseks gun) goes flying Cady is hit
in the chest by the propane stove he goes down The boat
pirhouettes then continues pell-mell down the raging river

Sam grabs Danny then Karen

He hustles the women out of the cabin onto

struggling for the gun which slides across the floor --
teward one or tha othar -- than away as the boat pitches

And then ae the dinky old boat hits the rapids there’s no
telling which end is up A jutting rock impales the hull

and than the rampaging tide forces the craft onto the next
treacherous shoal that gives the Cape Faar River its name -

- and suddenly Cady hae the gun and ha’e wildly looking
around for Sam pointing the gun -- at Sam wheres Sam --
Then a click below him Startled he looks down Sees

Sam crouchad has locked the other handcuff around Cady’s
ankle Cady is now chained to the pole

For an instant the men lock eyes

SCENE

As Sam scuttles away Cady fires - but it’s as wild as the
waves that rock the houseboat Then another wild shot as the
null splinters the floorboards start to shred then a huge
rock crashes up into FRAME knocking the gun from Cady’s grip
and cracking the cabin in half as Sam is hurled out onto

EXT RIVERBANK NIGHT
Semiconscious lolling on the muddy bank An instant later

Whats left of the houseboat is tossed by the tide onto the
bank as well And there is Cady sprawled still manacled to
the wreckage Now he stirs unsteadily rises to his knees -

-- and Sam’s hand wrapped around a heavy rock connects with
Cady’s face Cady is stunned But still he manages to jeer

CADY
Forget about that restraining order
counselor Youre well within five-
hundred yare-

Another roundhousa to Cady’s face splitting open his lip

Cady blinks and rubs his palm over his cheek mopping blood
Then raaches for the nearest stone and jabs it at Sam’s jaw

(cackles)
So here we are two lawyers --

Sam screams and rolls away in the muck Cady comes after
him again but the braakers crash onto the bank washing the
hulk down a few feet and dragging Cady backward with it He
flings his rock gashing open Sam‘s forehead

CADY
e working it out

Sam enraged runs at Cady - slipping in the mire down on

his knees but swinging His rock rammed hard at Cady’s
mouth cracking teeth Cady topples spits blood and laughs

SAM
I’m gonna kill you --
CADY
(smiles)
Kill me --

Now Sam scoops a small boulder out of the mud and raises it
high - with a gutteral cry he brings it crashing down --

-- just as Cady’s head slips out from under the big rock
harmlessly sinks into squishy mud as Cady is dragged by the
wrecked houseboat back into the river

And now as the houseboat starts to sink so does Cady He
furiously paddles to the surface gulps for air goes down
again bobs back up

Sam watches bloody and transfixed on the riverbank as Cady
“- just his head visible now -- regresses to the choir boy he
once was long ago In a small voice he begins to sing

CADY
On Jordan’s stormy banks I stand
Oh who will come with me

It‘s a revival song from Cady’s youth and he renders it in a
reedy eerie almost beautiful alto

CADY
IT am bound for the Promised Land
IT am bound for the Promised Land

And then his mouth is under then his nose And now just his
eyes staring at Sam Impossible to say what is behind those
eyes And then he’s gone Swallowed whole by the Cape Fear

Sam dazedly watches doesn’t move for a long time And then
he notices his hands slick with Cady‘’s blood

He squats dips his hands into the black water to rinse

Suddenly he is grippad by terror -- he yanks his hands out
before Cady’s corpse can somehow grab him pull him under

The blood is still on Sam’s hands It‘1ll be there for
awhile

Now CAMERA begins to RISE and we slowly glide upriver as we
gradually DISSOLVE TO the following DAWN and we HEAR OVER

DANNY’S VOICE
It wasn’t until lats fall that all our
bongs and bruises healed Dad says he
still feels some ache now and then

CAMERA LANDS on
EXT RIVERBANK DAWN

The storm has long since abated It is an impossibly clear
crisp summer morning

but I’m not sure it’s physical pain
that he’s feeling

On the bank huddled and shivering are all three Bowdens

DANNYS VOICE
Back home everything eventually got
straightened out Dad kept his license
and I managed an A in Special English
and Mom bought herself a new dog

Now Sam rises Squints downriver looking for boats

DANNYS VOICE
Still after all that happened folks
treated us differently And I guess we
are different now But that’s okay
Because I think that if you hang on to
the past you die a littie every day

Then Karen rises too She slips an arm around Sams waist

Then Danny stands All three scanning the horizon for a boat
to take them nome

DANNYS VOICE
And for myself I know Id rather live
