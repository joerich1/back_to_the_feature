INT HOSPITAL NURSERY - NIGHT

BABIES in bassinets isolettes incubators BABIES sleeping
BABIES blinking BABIES cooing BABIES chirping BABIES
squalling

Its the SQUALLING BABIES the ones with pinched faces and tiny
bunched fists that seem to interest the TWO ANONYMOUS MEN in
Military Uniforms (Their anonymity is assured by the angles
from which they are seen they are hands they are feet they are
the backs of heads)

A lone NURSE watches them grimly as they make their selections
marking the cribs of the most active noisy BABIES with Xs

CUT TO
EXT VANHOSPITAL - NIGHT

ANGLE ON VAN DOORS slamming shut on a dozen squalling BABIES in
tiered red cribs

ANGLE ON THE VAN pulling away from the loading dock of the large
hospital as a date is SUPERED over the scene

CUT TO
INT CAGEBASEMENT ROOM - DAY OR NIGHT

Vicious teeth savage snarls tearing flesh as three fierce
fighting DOGS battle a single WOLVERINE in large steel cage

The cage is in the middle of a gloomy windowless room surrounded
by twenty TWO-YEAR-OLDS seated on folding chairs and dressed in
identical gray overalls As the TWO-YEAR-OLDS watch the battle
amazement on their innocent faces a date appears SUPERED over
the scene

WE DISCOVER in the shadows more ANONYMOUS MEN (and WOMEN) some
of them in Military Uniforms observing the children

CUT TO
INT A WINDOWLESS CEMENT ROOM - DAY OR NIGHT

Its creepy the same children two years older milling about a
bare cement room apparently unsupervised They ought to look
cute but somehow these joyless FOUR-YEAR-OLDS look slightly
sinister all of them wearing drab uniforms and military burr-cut
hair Again a date is SUPERED over the scene --

-- just as an AGGRESSIVE FOUR-YEAR-OLD approaches a PASSIVE FOUR
YEAR-OLD seated on the floor and kicks him

Its a harmless childs kick But then as the DATE DISAPPEARS
he kicks the PASSIVE FOUR-YEAR-OLD again And again

The servo-motor in a remote video camera mounted high on the wall
WHINES slightly as the camera pans to the record the action

CUT TO
INT WINDOWLESS CLASSROOM - DAY OR NIGHT

Puzzles Fingers fit shapes into holes The puzzles arent fun
puzzles theyre obviously tests of intelligence or dexterity or
both SIX-YEAR-OLDS now the boys perform in a grim room under
fluorescent lights as more ANONYMOUS MEN and WOMEN in polished
shoes and sharply creased military slacks cruise the aisles
observing

As a date appears SUPERED over this scene

WE NOTICE one of the SIX-YEAR-OLDS is becoming familiar to us
TODD We NOTICE his intense eyes as he dexterously manipulates

a puzzle

Cut TO
EXT FIELD - DAY
Behind a cyclone fence topped with curlicues of razor wire the
boys now TEN-YEAR-OLDS are marching in formation under the
supervision of a (faceless) DRILL SERGEANT Again a date is
SUPERED over the scene

CUT TO
INT GYMNASIUM - DAY
Fourteen-year-old TODD is doing bench presses in shorts while all
around him his FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD COMRADES work out with weights
in a very grim and spartan gym that resembles a sinister
concentration camp more than the yuppie spas of the 20th Century
The date appears SUPERED over the scene

CUT TO
EXT OBSTACLE COURSEMONTAGE - DAY

The FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLDS TODD among them jump roll dive crawl
swim and rappel through a brutal course featuring

vertical wooden walls
fast moving rapids
tangles of barbed wire
steep rock faces
and finally a jungle of dangling chains with tiny circular
platforms about eight inches in diameter every ten feet
FOURTEEN YEAR OLDS bloody each other with pugil sticks and padded
cudgels while they swing twenty feet above the ground One of
them is knocked off plummets downward CRUNCH

CUT TO
EXT SNOW COVERED LANDSCAPE - DAY
Long even strides two inches of snow Breathing hard the
SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLDS now lope through hills and woods in shorts and
T-shirts their breath coming in steamy blasts as the date is

SUPERED over the scene

This a brutal cross country run under a grim sky in bitter cold
weather but the SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLDS are super-fit their faces
hard and without expression their eyes as cold as snake eyes

Except for the STRAGGLER a lone boy whos bringing up the rear
obviously in trouble gasping for air struggling struggling
struggling to keep his feet

ANGLE ON A HILL where ANONYMOUS OBSERVERS all in military dress
watch

ANGLE ON THE STRAGGLER unable to keep his feet going down
gasping With fearful eyes he looks toward the hill where he
knows the OBSERVERS are

ANGLE ON THE PACK sixteen SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLDS not looking back
even as a single SHOT rings out TODD doesnt even blink just
keeps running

CUT TO
EXT SHOOTING RANGE - DAY

Suddenly out of nowhere a scary mechanized pop-up target a
MILITARY FIGURE erupts from the long grass weapon pointing
Before the weapon can flash a laser bean AUTOMATIC FIRE ravages
the target and it disappears back into the grass The boys
EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLDS now are wearing combat gear and carrying
automatic weapons as they advance through a sloping field of tall
grass

Different sophisticated TARGETS pop up urgently sometimes close
sometimes far some MOVING rapidly on tracks

The EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLDS expertly mow down menacing MILITARY
FIGURES while holding their fire when ANIMAL TARGETS or UNARMED
CIVILIANS and CHILDREN appear

The eighteen-year-old on point is RILEY a muscular redhead
TODD is right behind him as a date is SUPERED over the scene

Suddenly multiple TARGETS appear charging

BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA First TARGET down

RILEY panning for the next target holds fire passes over two
MOTHERS HOLDING CHILDREN pans for a nearby SOLDIER TARGET But
the SOLDIER TARGET zips behind the MOTHERS HOLDING CHILDREN
taking cover weapon pointed at RILEY
For half a second RILEY hesitates

BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA TODD blazes away mercilessly blowing away
the MOTHERS HOLDING CHILDREN TARGET and the SOLDIER TARGET

THE MAIN TITLE APPEARS
as the ROAR OF GUNS gives way to MUSIC
CUT TO
INT PROCESSING ROOM - DAY
Skillful hands operate a tattoo pen stenciling an insignia and
a number on the left side of RILEYS face over the cheekbone
His cheek says RILEY LB his face reveals nothing as

OPENING CREDITS BEGIN

The next face is TODD The skillful hands with the tattoo pen go
to work on his face marking stenciling the skin as

OPENING CREDITS CONTINUE

Then the tattoo artists bands finish with TODD and move on to
the next MAN leaving TODD staring straight ahead his cheek
tattooed his face like carved stone his eyes as unfathomable as
the eyes of a statue as THE OPENING CREDITS CONCLUDE

Cut TO

EXT JUNGLE - DAY

Machinegun fire SOLDIERS in cammies moving through lush tropical
growth

A mortar explodes a SOLDIER is engulfed in shrapnel As the
smoke clears the SOLDIER screams mindlessly like a siren This
is real war not training

A title and date appear on the screen saying
2011 THE BOLIVIAN WAR

As the title fades we glimpse TODD advancing at a crouch through
smoke and enemy fire blazing away at the unseen enemy Sweaty
and smudged his uniform torn and stained with blood TODD
reveals nothing on his stone face But hes clearly
unintimidated by the death of his screaming comrade as we

Cut TO
EXT PINE WOODS - DAY

Automatic weapons CHATTER as TODD struggles through thick snowy
woods half-carrying a bloody comrade barely recognizable as
RILEY Bullets spatter bark and leaves as TODD and RILEY take
cover behind a fallen log A date and title appear SUPERED over
the action

2012 THE MONTANA INCIDENT

RILEY is nearly unconscious TODD glances at his own wound a
savage opening in his side He considers the torn flesh as
dispassionately as a man checking a flea bite

Bullets whiz around the wounded man as we

WE DISCOVER TODD RILEY and several OTHER SOLDIERS exhausted
parched in torn and bloodied uniforms sharing a single canteen
under the blazing sun War is hard work

CUT TO

EXT LAUNCH PAD - DAY

A fury of flames the THUNDER of ignition as huge rocket engines
lift a space vehicle off the launching pad and propel it skyward

EXT OUTER SPACE
Profound SILENCE The space vehicle that the rocket propelled is
a weathered looking military spaceship gliding through the
blackness of outer space like a huge shark A date and title
appear SUPERED over the scene

As the title fades away in the eerie silence we

Cut TO

EXT ANOTHER PLANET - NIGHT
A huge moon looms in the blackness above a barely visible
landscape

2020 THE ARGENTINE SECTOR

SIX SOLDIERS stagger through the rough terrain in pressure suits
and plexi helmets breathing from tanks

Sudden automatic fire staggers the lead SOLDIER His helmet is
pierced air and blood erupt from the hole in his face plate

The SERGEANT his futuristic chevrons on his helmet signals
the men to take cover starts to return fire As a flare
illuminates the battlefield we RECOGNIZE the sergeant through
his visor Its TODD

CUT TO
EXT EXTRATERRESTRIAL CITY - DAY

Bombed out Buildings turned to rubble smoking ruins rain An
extra-terrestrial city ravaged by war to such a degree that it
bears an uncanny resemblance to DresdenEarth in 1945 after the
fire-bombing The architecture even in ruins recalls old
Europe and the streets are narrow as in before (or after)
automobiles

Bursts of AUTOMATIC FIRE occasional MORTAR BLASTS A spooky
battle between unseen SOLDIERS is taking place in seemingly
deserted streets and alleyways And SUPERED over the gloomy

scene

THE THIRD DRESDEN MOON
(116 Earth atmos acceptable oxygen)

CRACK CRACK CRACK Shots

Suddenly a terrified MOTHER dashes along the street a screaming
BABY in her arms looking for shelter

A CIVILIAN MAN pops out of a doorway pulls her to safety
REVEAL TODD watching from the shell of a once proud building

TODDS POV of four ENEMY SOLDIERS running at a crouch among the
rubble

ANGLE ON TODD watching them scurry into a cellar door TODD
turns and gives a hand signal

ANGLE ON RILEY twenty yards away hidden behind exposed
machinery acknowledging the signal and along with a THIRD
SOLDIER advancing toward the cellar

EXT CELLAR DOOR

TODD RILEY and the THIRD SOLDIER converge stealthily
coordinating with hand signals

TODD pulls the pin on a grenade and RILEY and the THIRD SOLDIER
kick in the door

TODD tosses the grenade in as RILEY fires a withering barrage of
automatic fire through the cellar door

BAHWHOOM The grenade EXPLODES

Then RILEY TODD and the THIRD SOLDIER charge in

INT CELLAR

HEAVY FIRE as TODD RILEY and the THIRD SOLDIER spray the room
ANGLE ON TODD signaling cease fire

Sudden silence Drifting smoke ThenGROANS

Four ENEMY SOLDIERS are sprawled motionless horribly
eviscerated A fifth ENEMY SOLDIER horribly wounded is
groaning

ANGLE ON TODD surveying the scene stone faced

TODDS POV of the enemy dead and several CIVILIANS equally dead
as well as the dead BODIES of several CHILDREN

BANG RILEY shoots the groaning ENEMY SOLDIER
Silence again

CLOSE ON TODD his stone face What does he see What does he
feel Anything A mystery

CUT TO
INT BARRACKS - DAY
A spartan room bare bunk-beds Rain POUNDS on a window that
looks out into a stormy sky over the godforsaken ruins of the

Third Dresden Moon

TODD is sitting on a bunk shirtless His new rank has been
tattooed on his right cheek theres a scar under one eye and
war-

another scar that distorts his lip slightly The names of
various battles have been neatly stenciled down his left arm an
official record not a decoration TODD is silent staring into
space The room is full of SOLDIERS in T-shirts fatigues
sleepwear WORDS APPEAR SUPERED OVER THE SCENE

The WORDS FADE AWAY the silence continues the rain BEATS on the
barracks no one says a word they just stare into space or watch
the rain beat on the windowpane They look like robotsused
robots made individual only by their different scars

CUT TO
EXT BARRACKS - DAY
Rain Low buildings boarded windows slogans painted on the

scarred walls the makeshift barracks in one building command
quarters in the next

A lone figure a MAN IN A PONCHO hurries through the downpour
passing the barracks heading for the command quarters

INT COMMAND QUARTERS

Entering the MAN shakes rain off his poncho His name is
RUBRICK hes thirty-five a lieutenant He faces the two bored
OFFICERS lounging in the cluttered office where outdated
equipment is strung together by mazes of wire and the desktops
are heaped with printout sheets and styrofoam coffee cups

The captain CHURCH has his feet on the desk Hes fifty years
old gray and fat and soft The other officer SLOAN also a
lieutenant is a thirty-five year old woman dark moderately
attractive but not particularly happy

INT STATION - DAY - LATER

A WEAPON FIRING BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA The automatic weapon is
being fired by the veteran soldier RILEY Hes blazing away at
an elaborate electronic target a hundred yards away in the huge
space

TODD is watching with the other VETERAN SOLDIERS Theyre seated
on the floor wearing drab fatigues directly across from the
twenty NEW SOLDIERS

As TODD glances at them the NEW SOLDIERS look back unblinkingly
(The VETERANS in spite of their impassive expressions look very
human compared to the NEW SOLDIERS Their battle scars mark them
as individuals in sharp contrast to the perfectly-muscled young
giants across from them)

The firing stops and RILEY his weapon empty leaps to his feet
and salutes RUBRICK whos been watching the demonstration with
the rest of the officers

RILEY
Sir

RUBRICK
Very nice Riley Fall away

RILEY
(another salute)
Sir

As RILEY joins the VETERANS squatting motionlessly RUBRICK
glances at the shredded electronic target glances at his
stopwatch then looks at Mekum

RUBRICK
Thirty seconds 90 percent hits

MEKUM smirks picks up the weapon disassembles it rapidly
MEKUM
Lets make it more difficult

RUBRICK CHURCH and SLOAN exchange glances of disbelief as MEKUM
scatters the disassembled parts onto the concrete floor with a
loud clatter

TODD watches unblinking as MEKUM looks to the NEW SOLDIERS

MEKUM
Caine Six-Oh-Seven
A blond Nordic giant is suddenly on his feet among the NEW
SOLDIERS There is real dignity in his salute hes like a pro

CAINE 607
Sir

MEKUM
Assemble the weapon load fire on
the target from various evasive
positions in a thirty-second period

OFFICERS look at each other again in disbelief
MEKUM

Startingnow

MEKUM punches his watch as CAINE 607 gracefully begins to pick up
pieces of weapon doing it rapidly yet without apparent haste

TODD is watching revealing nothing

CLACK KA SHACK CLICK CAINE 607 slaps the weapon together
loading a magazine with a final KA SHUCK then he dives to the
floor firing a rapid burst at the electronic target which blinks
wildly

OFFICERS watch impressed

CAINE 607 is firing from another position

The target goes crazy

CAINE 607 is rolling and firing at the same time
The target goes wild

MEKUMs watch clicks off 27 seconds2829

The firing stops

TODD stares impassively as CAINE 607 salutes Beside him RILEY
watches also

MEKUM
(to Caine 607)
As you were soldier

RUBRICK is looking at the electronic target grudgingly
impressed

RUBRICK
Ninety-nine percent
MEKUM
(smug)
While taking evasive action

RUBRICK
(amazed)
Thatsvery good

CUT TO
INT WEIGHT AREASTATION - DAY - A LITTLE LATER

A NEW SOLDIER cleans an awesome weight with what looks like ease
as RUBRICK CHURCH and SLOAN again exchange impressed glances
and MEKUM watches smugly

Theyre still in the giant warehouse in the gym section among all
sorts of ominous exercise devices The NEW SOLDIERS and VETERANS
are gathered in separate groups at attention their faces like
stone

TODD is watching the big man handle the weight easily
MEKUM
See Much stronger

CHURCH
What about endurance

Cut TO

EXT RUINS - DAY

TODD is loping through sheets of rain The terrain around him
features ghostly shells of buildings shards of a city nearly
invisible through the curtains of rain

His feet slash through flooding gutters and trash filled streets
bordered by ruins as he runs smoothly evenly keeping a good
pace his breath rasping rhythmically his eyes revealing
nothing as we

CUT TO
INT OFFICER QUARTERS - DAY

SLOAN accepts a cup of hot coffee from RUBRICK as she considers
the plastic papers MEKUM has spread on the cluttered desk
Ponchos have been hung by the door MEKUM is pointing to various
numbers and paragraphs

CHURCH has been staring out the window into the pouring rain He
turns to MEKUM and interrupts
CHURCH
Our man has been out there fifteen
minutes now Shouldnt you send one

MEKUM

(smug grin to Church)
In a minute

(turning back to Sloan)
Now see this test This shows what

EXT TODD RUNNINGRUINS - DAY

Rain slashes his face as TODD runs his eyes staring vacantly
into the blinding storm his legs pumping evenly his feet
chopping through the thick mud in a wasteland of shelled
apartment buildings where rat-like CREATURES scurry out of his
way as we

CUT TO
INT STATION - DAY

Separated by fifteen yards the two groups of SOLDIERS the NEW
and the VETERAN sit on the cold cement floor staring vacantly
into space as they await orders Occasionally a VETERAN will rub
his chin another will scratch his nose but nobody says
anything and when their eyes accidentally meet they look away
deliberately expressionless Nobody flinches when a big door
opens and pale light streams in

MEKUM is standing there in a poncho

MEKUM
Melton Eight Five Forward

MELTON one of the husky new soldiers climbs to his feet and
steps toward MEKUM saluting

MELTON
Eight Five sir

MEKUM
Ten miles Melton on the run

MELTONs face shows no expression as MEKUM continues
MEKUM (0S)
Youve got sixty minutes Go

MELTON

MELTON heads out into the rain running smoothly and easily as
we

EXT TODDRUINS - DAY

TODDs breath comes in even rasps as his feet splash over rough
terrain splash splash splash hard work but nothing in his
stone face indicates hes not equal to the task Splash splash

Cut TO

INT OFFICER QUARTERS - DAY

In the cluttered office RUBRICK CHURCH and SLOAN look up from
a conversation as MEKUM enters dripping wet and takes off his
poncho smiling smugly
MEKUM
My man left exactly twenty minutes
after yours Make a note of that

RUBRICK
What are we supposed to do with the
old soldiers

MEKUM
(a shrug and a grin)

Old soldiers never die

EXT TODDRUINS - DAY

Breathing steadily raspily TODD lopes through the rain
Something makes him glance back over his shoulder

fq

Thirty yards back he sees a vague shape obscured by rain
TODD looks ahead again his face revealing nothing his legs
maintaining the same even pace running running running

fq

Then he looks back again

The vague shape is taking form a GHOSTLY RUNNER getting closer
TODD continues at the same even place He doesnt look back
again until he feels closeness Then he looks

TS MELTON only a few yards behind him running effortlessly
eeping a steady pace thats faster than TODDs The bigger man
moves even with TODD without even looking at him as though TODD
werent there and then he moves ahead like a big machine
inexorable

As TODD runs eyes straight ahead he can see MELTON becoming
ghostly disappearing in the curtains of rain ahead as we

Cut TO

INT STATION - DAY

The huge doors are open to the rain as SLOAN CHURCH RUBRICK
and MEKUM watch for signs of TODD Still dripping vet the
muscular MELTON is standing beside MEKUM breathing heavily but
not desperately

MEKUM
Of course age is a factor but the
real factor is the training program
especially the psychological The
mind controls the body after all
and were doing wonderful things
with the mind
A shape appears in the rain a hundred yards off moves closer
takes the form of a runner running Its TODD still moving at
the same pace his face like stone

TODD lopes into the big warehouse and breathing hard but evenly
comes to a halt in front of RUBRICK and salutes

TODD
Sir

RUBRICK
At ease soldier

CHURCH has been thinking and now he speaks to MEKUM

CHURCH
Whats the price of all that speed
Is he tired

MEKUM
Tired

CHURCH
Todd here ran the pace hes been
taught to run Hes still strong
Send him up the chain Rube

RUBRICK
(to Todd)
Soldier Up the chain
TODD

Sir
TODD salutes and lopes toward ten chains that dangle from the
rafters sixty feet above grabs one and starts up it hand over
hand

MEKUM watches TODD climb then looks at CHURCH who is looking at
him expectantly

MEKUM grins at CHURCH

Then MEKUM looks back at TODD not hurrying

TODD is thirty feet up and climbing passing the eight inch
circular platforms or footholds in the chain every ten feet
MEKUM
(sharply)
Melton on the double Up a chain

MELTON
(saluting)
Sir

MELTON takes a few easy strides gracefully catches a chain mid-
stride and smarts up climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD

CHURCH SLOAN and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men
struggle upward toward the rafters

Three quarters of the way up MELTON comes even with TODD then
passes him

MEKUM watching smirks

CHURCH is watching too and hes still not satisfied His brow
is knit somethings bothering him

ANGLE HIGH ABOVE AMONG THE GIRDERS

Stonefaced MELTON is resting an a platform on the chain sixty
feet up beneath the girders swaying gently

His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a
platform on an adjacent chainonly three feet away

Their eyes meet TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up
three feet apart Neither man blinks neither man flinches
neither man reveals anything at all

LOW ANGLE LOOKING UP

CHURCH considers the men high above then to MEKUM

CHURCH
What aboutspirit
MEKUM
(as in whats that)
Spirit
(a grin)
Oh You mean AQaggressive
qualities
CHURCH
Whatever the latest jargon is

MEKUM

sexual energy in aggressive
physicality these new ones are
ninety-nine percent without
sexual inclination Its all
aggression

SLOAN
(dryly)
Real men

CHURCH
(sharply to Sloan)
At ease Lieutenant
(turning to Mekum
serious)
What if they fought

A sudden silence
SLOAN raises her eyebrows gives RUBRICK a look

Frowning thoughtfully MEKUM looks up
MEKUM
You mean up there

CHURCH
(to Rubrick)
Go ahead Rube Tell Todd to take
him
MEKUM
No

They all look at MEKUM Is this the chink in the armor The new
soldiers cant fight

CHURCH

MEKUM
Not fair No contest Send two
more of your old ones up

Now CHURCH RUBRICK and SLOAN are stunned They exchange a
glance

MEKUM
Go ahead

RUBRICK shrugs turns to the VETERANS still sitting stoically in
a group on the cement floor

RUBRICK
Romero A -- Goines DL -- up

Two of the veterans ROMERO and GOINES leap immediately to their
feet and climb rapidly
SLOAN CHURCH and RUBRICK exchange a look as MEKUM smirks
confidently

ANGLE ON TODD AND MELTON ABOVE Theyre still facing each other
across the sixty foot drop

MELTON glances downwithout losing sight of TODD

ROMERO and GOINES are coming up the chains fast hand over hand
Theyre within ten feet their impassive faces look dangerous

Nothing shows on MELTONs machine-face but he starts a slight
motion in his chain so that he spins slowly That way as the
veterans surround him he keeps a continual eye an all three

TODD his face impassive eyes MELTON vigilantly
ANGLE ON RUBRICK BELOW

around the new soldier then he shouts loudly at them

his free hand and with both feet

MELTON ignores the blows from behind as he grabs ROMERO by the
face with one hand yanks the face close to his own and squeezes
mercilessly

ANGLE ON TODD TWENTY FEET BELOW Hes managed to get a foothold
on one of the mini-platforms His face horribly bloody he looks
up at the action twenty feet above him and sees MELTON suddenly
hurl ROMERO downward

ROMERO rockets down past TODD
ANGLE ON THE FLOOR as SMASH ROMEROs body crunches against the

cement not far from RUBRICK SLOAN and CHURCH splattering them
with blood

Their eyes are wide with disbelief and horror as they look up
again

ANGLE ON MELTON in the girders as he turns to face the man whos
been clubbing him from behindGOINES

GOINES swings his chain wide and MELTON eyes merciless deadly
swings after him

ANGLE ON TODD bloody struggling up the chain hand over hand
His eyes follow MELTON above as the new soldier swings and
swings trying to get a blow at GOINES

Just then GOINES lunges at MELTON SMACK SMASH he hits him
hard and WHAM MELTON hits him back

ANGLE ON TODD who has climbed to a platform foothold on his
chain five feet above the swinging fighters TODD looks down

on MELTONs back as the big man swings close watching tensing
then

TODD dives off his chain and lands on MELTONs back crooking one
arm around the new soldiers neck and pounding him with one free
hand and strangling him with the other arm

MELTON gurgles while GOINES hits him in the face

ANGLE ON MEKUM WATCHING BELOW For the first time a frown of
concern wrinkles his brow

ANGLE ON MELTON AND TODD on chains just below the girders
MELTON slams an elbow back into TODDs ribs hard and TODD gasps
for air but

GOINES uses the moment to slam a knee into MELTONs balls and
MELTON gasps then grabs GOINES by the neck with one hand rips
him from the chain and sends him plunging violently downward
even as

TODD goes for face with his free hand

SLAM MELTON smashes TODD in the ribs with an elbow

WHAM Another blow to the ribs from MELTONs elbow
TODD is losing his grip

RILEY watches below his face a mask

MELTON bites and elbows furiously

TODD loses his grip and grabs at MELTON rakes flesh as he begins
to fall and then

Plunging downward TODD grabs wildly at the chain and catches it
but he keeps falling the chain ripping flesh from his hand
for twenty feet until

He cant hold on any longer TODD plunges the last thirty feet
to the floor landing with a terrible crunch right on top of
ROMEROs broken body below

Sudden silence

ANGLE ON THE VETERANS watching impassively as TODD lies
motionless sprawled on ROMEROs body

ANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS revealing no feelings
ANGLE ON CHURCH SLOAN and RUBRICK looking stunned and shaken

Its MEKUM who breaks the silence SCREAMING furiously at the

CHURCH glances at TODDs corpse dumped over ROMEROs broken body
tries to assuage him

CUT TO
INT FURNACESFURNACE ROOM - NIGHT

A rage of flame The mouth of a huge furnace leers with yellow
fury eight feet high

Two men BURNERS in asbestos fire suits and helmets appear
laboriously dragging a tattered sofa leaking stuffing With
effort they shove it into the blazing furnace where it is quickly
consumed Slowly the BURNERS turn and trudge back for another
load as we REVEAL A REFUSE BIN seven feet high looming in the
shadows not far from the flickering light of the furnace Its
overflowing with junk barely distinguishable in the gloom

The BURNERS grab blindly and haul out the next object

ts ROMEROs dead body They haul it out of the bin and let it
flop limply to the floor where ROMERO stares sightlessly at
nothing
The BURNERS stare at the body exchange a blank look through
their visors shrug and start to drag the heavy carcass toward
the flames

INT REFUSE BINFURNACE ROOMCLOSE BY

In the near darkness the faintest flickering light reveals two
tangled BODIES motionless in the confusion of refuse But not
quite motionless A hand opens and closes A bloody hand
Fingers twitch

INT FURNACE ROOM

ROARING FLAMES as ROMEROs body is tossed unceremoniously into
the
fire where the flames begin to consume it

For half a second the BURNERS watch ROMERO melt into fire then
they turn their backs and head back for another load

INT REFUSE BINFURNACE ROOM

BURNERS hands reach in and haul out another corpse GOINES
dragging the body right over TODDs body

As GOINES shoe drags over TODDs face TODDs eyes flicker
stupidly

Then GOINES corpse is pulled over the edge of the bin

TODD blinks fighting for consciousness Where is he He moves
his head

INT FURNACE ROOM

The BURNERS silhouetted by flames feed GOINES body to the
furnace

CLOSE ON THE FLAMES as GOINES body is consumed by raging
flames

ANGLE ON THE BURNERS trudging to the bin They reach in blindly
for whatevers next Tugging with effort they struggle the
clumsy object over the rim and let it fall to the floor Itsa
mattress

Communicating with a look the FIRST BURNER drags the mattress
toward the fire while the SECOND BURNER reaches again into the

bin

The SECOND BURNER frowns through the visor struggles with
something frowns wrestles with it

Finally with great effort he pulls out a big carton that
immediately spills old magazines on him

Disgusted he pulls the partially full carton across the refuse-
littered floor toward the furnaces

ANGLE ON HIS FEET as the SECOND BURNER struggles toward the
fire stepping over a trail of blood which is hardly noticeable
in the flickering firelight

He passes another big corrugated bin with a sign an it The sign
says NONFLAMMABLE WASTE DISPOSALand the trail of blood leads
to that bin

CUT TO
EXT OUTER SPACE - DAY

Silence A vast darkness with only a few tiny lights in the
infinite depths

A battered rusty spaceship glides slowly and silently into view
This is a GARBAGE SHIP and it looks it Awkward and slow and
totally unglamorous it moves through space like a great clumsy
church made of steel as we

CUT TO
INT HOLDGARBAGE SHIP - DAY

As the massive doors on the underside of the ship open light
spills in and there is a huge ROAR as tons of debris including
massive pieces of machinery huge statues old vehicles and
numerous containers spill out through the open bays and tumble
downward The one that says Nonflammable Waste on the side
careens against the bulkhead with a THUNDEROUS sound then
hurtles downward

EXT JUNK MOUNTAINSLANDSCAPE

As debris from the ship tumbles down onto one of several huge
mountains of junk that loom 800 hundred feet above a windswept
terrain dimly lit by four pale suns the bays close and the
rusty GARBAGE SHIP glides away

Still the cascade of machines and other bulky junk THUNDERS down
the steep slopes shattering breaking into parts tumbling and
tumbling settling here and there while a SCREAMING WIND very
powerful picks off the lighter pieces and carries them off like
snow blowing off a mountain
The familiar-looking container somersaults halfway down the slope
where it bursts open spilling a confusion of junk

Above the container a huge drum smashes into a hunk of machinery
and splits oozing an awful looking liquid that spills down onto
the contents of the container sizzling and smoking on steel
eating it like acid

Not far from a smoking piece of steel WE FIND TODDS foot
protruding from the junk heap Its motionless Acid drips and
hisses

ANGLE ON TODD sprawled inside the mountain of junk grimacing
in pain as acid hits his exposed foot Trapped in the debris
battered and bloody and weak he struggles to rise fights the
heavy objects pinning him fights to avoid the dripping acid As
the wind SCREAMS furiously he continues to struggle against the
junk that pins him as we

CUT TO
EXT INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE MOUNTAIN - DAY - A LITTLE LATER

TODDs head caked with blood appears from the junk like a man
looking out of a cave Wind seizes at his hair furiously

He looks up sees four pale suns in the skyjust as a huge
steel lathe comes somersaulting down from above like a loose
boulder and TODD has to duck hastily to avoid certain death

As the heavy steel tumbles down the slope below him wind plucks
a twelve-foot I-beam from the slope next to him and whips it off
in a frenzy

Holding on for dear life TODD looks down at the ground four
hundred feet below and sees a bleak wasteland strewn with junk
shifting and skittering in the wind

He notices something and reacts

Far down on the floor there is a strange pattern of linesand
moving along one of the lines are four tiny FIGURESthey could
be humansbut maybe not

For a moment TODD watches them

Then he starts to climb downward through the labyrinth of junk
inside the mountain and we

Cut TO
EXT LOWER ON JUNK MOUNTAIN - DAY - MINUTES LATER

Far down the slope perhaps forty feet from the foot of the
massive mountain TODDs head pokes out of the confusion of junk
and he looks down at the FIGURES below

Seen more closely the FIGURES are more distinct but no less
mysterious Heavy outer garments like huge parkas and hoods blur
their individual shapes as they inch across the landscape
apparently clutching one of several crisscrossing wires that
stretch tautly for miles across the bleak terrain like roads
through the wind

TODD watches as one of the FIGURES moves off the road Hes
trailing rope that attaches him to the others as he struggles
through the wind walking almost on all fours like an ape

TODD watches the FIGURE moving among bits of junk until he
locates something he wants picks it up and starts to struggle
back toward the others dragging his burden after him

TODD is watching what would seem to be some sort of scavenging
process by these strange unearthly FIGURES as we

CUT TO

EXT FADING SUNS - DUSK - LATER

The four suns are changing color dimming in the sky as we
CUT TO

EXT LANDSCAPE AND JUNK MOUNTAIN - DUSK

Tiny in the distance the four FIGURES are moving together along
a cable headed away from the junk mountain

At ground level now TODD is watching them crouched behind a
massive transformer that teeters slightly in the wind in spite of
its great bulk

Peeking around the sheltering transformer he spots one of the
taut cables lashed to an enormous piece of junk near the foot of
his mountain The cable is twenty yards away in a canyon of
junk and hell have to move across open space partially exposed
to the wind in order to get to it

He starts out from behind the transformer
WHOOOOOO Screaming wind lifts him and hurls him thirty feet

his arms flailing He comes down even further from the cable
struggling to keep on his feet Gritting his teeth he fights
the wind struggles toward the cable

Suddenly a chunk of steel whips at him and he ducks just in time
as it whistles close to his head

TODD drops to the ground and starts to crawl under the wind
toward the taut cable and we

CUT TO
EXT STEEL HENGE - DUSK - LATER

Seen by TODD the four tiny FIGURES are far ahead disappearing
in the distance and the dusk

Following them on a taut wire TODD is passing through a barren
landscape punctuated by strange ruins great shapes of steel
thrusting out of the ground and looming over and around him
vaguely recognizable as the wreckage of a space vehicle that must
have crashed long ago

The mountains of junk squat a mile behind him Hes come a long
way its almost dark hes weak

He hangs onto the wire walking with effort
He can no longer see the creatures ahead of him on the wire
He notices something thirty yards off the wire to the right
Steel crosses Maybe a hundred of them A cemetery
Just then the wind catches TODD yanks him but he hangs onto
the wire holding on desperately as the wind pulls at him and
makes him flap like a pennant in the breeze
Then the wind dies enough for him to get both hands on the wire
and get weakly to his feet For a moment he looks like he might
collapse but he doesnt and we

CUT TO
EXT LANDSCAPE - NIGHT

At night the four suns glow darkly like night lights

TODD is alone on the planet punished by the savage wind
struggling along the wire shivering

Every stop is an effort but the eyes stare into the dark and
they reveal no emotion not even when he suddenly tenses seeing
something ahead
In the distance a faint light glows
TODD considers it as we

CUT TO
EXT WINDOWSKYLIGHT - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

The window is detached plexi from some kind of vehicle embedded
in a low mound of earth like a skylight Whatever is making
the light comes from below in a sort of hut that slopes only
inches above the ground

TODD is hanging onto the cable only ten yards from the strange
window He can see more of them glowing all around him as well
as silhouetted pipes issuing smoke to the wind

TODD drops to his belly to keep under the wind He crawls ten
yards to the window and pears through it

TODDS POV of a fantastic confusion of color and movement seen
through the thick scratched plexiglass window The wild blurs of
activity make no sense to him whatsoever nor do the very FAINT
SQUEALS of sound barely audible over the deafening ROAR of the
wind

(What hes seeing in the room below is a violent pillow fight
between eight BOYS and GIRLS ranging from four to ten years old
Wearing cotton shifts dyed red blue or yellow theyre smacking
each other violently with rag pillows and laughing happily ina
dormitory-style full of stacked bunks)

ANGLE ON TODD prone on the roof mystified Hes never seen
anything like it His grease-covered face barely reveals his
puzzlement when he is suddenly distracted by a change in the
wind

The ROARING WIND that has dominated the environment since he
first
arrived has diminished to a strong breeze

TODD tries sitting up The breeze doesnt overpower him He
looks around

The meaningless SHRIEKS of the pillow fight though still muffled
by heavy plexiglass are LOUDER now but TODDs attention is on
the other windowskylight that glows from this strange roof and
on the strange sound thats coming to him borne on the breeze
a MUSICAL sound

Struggling weakly to his feet TODD staggers toward the next
window The MUSIC is LOUDER as he approaches -- its waltz music
played on an accordion

TODD drops to his knees and peers through the next window

TODDS POV through the second window another mysterious
vision The color and movement are more subdued but TODD is
just as puzzled

What hes seeing indistinctly through the thick plexiglass is an
OVERHEAD VIEW of a man and a woman gliding across the floor
moving as one first this way then that in time to a WALTZ In
the corner another person is making a strange movement that
seems to initiate the music

ANGLE ON TODD flat on the roof Now that the weak breeze has
given way to a deathly stillness the mysterious (to him) MUSIC
is clearly audible as TODD peers through the plexiglass at the
warm scene below as puzzled by the waltzing couple as by the
pillow fights

Then he gets to his feet again and in the stillness makes his way
past a smoking chimney toward the next window Halfway there he
freezeslistening

A strange haunting WHISTLING sound is coming from somewhere

TODD looks around at the blackness beyond the roof windows
Theres nothing visible

The mysterious sound is louder now drowning out the music
ominously drowning out everything everything everything

Suddenly TODD understands but hes too late

ROOOOOOOOOOAAR Its the WIND back with renewed fury more
powerful than ever

TODD is hurtled into the air tossed head over heels by the wind
struggling clutching at empty air in vain buffeted slammed to
the ground lifted again before he can flatten himself tossed
violently somersaulted helplessly

EXT INSIDE A TRENCH

WHAM TODD is slammed face first to the ground For a long
moment hes motionless untouched by the HOWLING WIND for reasons
that arent clear

Finally he rolls over weakly and looks up

In the weak light he can just make out the steep earthen walls of
a narrow trench looming eight feet straight up protecting him
from the wind howling overhead

TODD tries to get upbut the fall has injured his leg and he
slumps to the floor of the three-foot-wide trench too weak and
injured even to crawl

Lying there barely conscious gasping for breath he suddenly
sees something

Shoes Less than a foot from his bloody face
He manages to lift his head a little and look up

Silhouetted by the light spilling from an open door in the trench
wall are four childrenELLEN ten WILL six TOMMY five and
JOHNNY eight

Barely conscious TODD can just make out the astonishment on
their blurred shadowy faces as they look down at him in
amazement Then they go OUT OF FOCUS altogether as TODD slumps
unconscious and everything goes BLACK BLACK BLACK and we

CUT TO
INT MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

VOICES CONFUSION About fifty people are jammed into the low-
ceilinged meeting room all of them talking at once They are
PIONEERS men and women of all ages and many races a hardy
weathered-looking group dressed in plain clothes of muted color

Their faces seem to have been etched by the wind with deep lines
the skin burnished and even the younger ones have crows feet
around the eyes from squinting

As they chatter excitedly asking each other what happened who
found him where and so on a sharp-faced fifty-ish woman
HAWKINS is standing behind a table in the front of the room
calling for order

HAWKINS
Please Quiet please

Just as the hubbub finally dies down a grizzled pioneer named
SLADE bellows loudly at her

SLADE
Just tell me one thing How many of

them are there and are they armed

HAWKINS stares SLADE down refusing to speak until she has real
silence When she finally speaks her voice is calm and
controlled

HAWKINS
There in a manone man He was
found in the trench by several

children

A sudden murmur dies away quickly under HAWKINS hard stare
HAWKINS
This man was not armed

A murmur goes through the crowded room then a woman named ELISE
speaks over the hum of voices

ELISE
How could there only be one How
could he get here

HAWKINS glances toward MACE a muscular bearded man about
thirty

MACE
He was unconscious We couldnt ask
him anything He --

A commotion in the back room causes MACE to break off as JIMMY
PIG a clean-shaven burly-looking pioneer in his thirties pushes
his way in followed by four more PIONEERS All five of then are
wearing their huge hooded parkas strange Eskimo-type wind
goggles and carrying weapons

JIMMY PIG
Nothin out there We couldnt see
nobody couldnt see no ship no
vehicles nothinplus the winds
up again real strong

An excited hubbub HAWKINS is trying to restore order when SLADE
shouts over the commotion

SLADE
Theyre hiding I bet

HAWKINS ignores him as she speaks with firm authority

HAWKINS
Lets everybody calm down right now
(beat silence then)
We have an injured man among us
One man A traveler Unarmed
(another pause then)
We all want to do the decent thing
The decent thing is to help him
Maces wife Sandra is looking
after him now Now Id like a vote
of support on this course of action
from all of you

The way she says it you know shes used to getting her way and
in fact PIONEERS are exchanging glances and nodding when SLADE
shouts again

SLADE
You keep an eye on him Mace You
watch him

TODD is on his back in a bed in a tiny earth-walled bedroom He
stares stupidly at the woman bending over him She is SANDRA a
woman of twenty-five who is attractive but not in a glamorous
way Its a very natural beauty worn with intelligence and
dignity Shes wiping away blood and grease from TODDs face

TODDs eyes flick around the room even as he lies motionless
He sees a window high on one wall

He sees old-fashioned magazine pictures and bits of patterned
material hung here and there for decoration

Clothing hangs from pegs on the walls

He doesnt see the look in SANDRAs eyes as she discovers the
savage scar on his forehead or the sergeants tattoo on his
cheek Eyeing these telltale marks SANDRA pours liquid into a
spoon and holds it to his lips

SANDRA
Want to try some more of this

TODD swallows weakly
SANDRA smiles stands up moves toward the door
SANDRA
You rest now Ill give you more

later

TODD watches her exit
He hears her VOICE in the next rooma low murmur

Hes looking around again when a NOISE makes him look back toward
the door

A two-year-old is crawling into the room on hands and knees The
baby boy NATHAN stops just inside seeing TODD in the bed

NATHAN looks into TODDs eyes with childlike interest and wonder
TODD meets the look with those blank soldiers eyes

INT LIVING ROOM

A second tiny room next to the bedroom is the rest of the

conversation

MACE and SANDRA look into each others eyes very worried
Then

SANDRA
Well have to sleep on the floor

MACE
(suddenly alarmed)
Wheres Nathan

MACE is looking around He spots the open door to the bedroom
hurries to it and disappears
SANDRA starts after him looking worriedbut before she gets to
the door MACE reappears with NATHAN safely in his arms

even in the best conditions and right now the conditions are
awful as SOLDIERS in bulky space suits stumble through thick
smoke while a SIREN WHOOPS urgently and wounded SOLDIERS scream
in agony

WHOOOOM Another EXPLOSION SCREAMING METAL

Part of the bulkhead is shot away and the suction is like wind
ripping SOLDIERS out of the hole into space

whos firing back at the enemy while all around him SOLDIERS are
screaming and dying as we

Its the same bedroom but morning light is streaming in the high
window

He can hear SOUNDSLAUGHTERcoming from beyond the door

INT OTHER ROOM

NATHAN is wobbling forward with wide eyes as MACE holds one of
his hands and SANDRA holds the other Theyre teaching the child

to walk encouraging each step But when they let go NATHAN
totters forward only one step before landing flat on his ass
MACE and SANDRA laugh making the whole thing a game and NATHAN
after a moment of confusion joins in the laughter Its a warm
moment until SANDRA sensing a presence turns toward the
bedroom suddenly serious

MACE follows her look
TODD is standing in the doorway supporting himself on the door
framehis soldiers eyes full of unspoken menace one leg

heavily bandaged

SANDRA
(nervous)
You must beyou must be feeling
better
TODD says nothing His eyes flick to NATHAN
MACE is watching TODD sharply

MACE
Were teaching the boy to walk

SANDRA
(nervously filling silence)
Hes late learning He was sick for
a long time

TODD says nothing His eyes follow MACE whos gone to the corner
where hes seizing a heavy metal rod that might be a weapon

TODD tenses Ready Dangerous

As MACE turns toward him MACE doesnt notice the danger in
TODDS eyes

MACE
I got something for you

He innocently approaches with the metal rod
Super alert TODD watches MACE hold the rod out to him

MACE
Here

TODD looks mistrustful

MACE
Like this

MACE demonstrates using the rod like a cane
MACE
See

Expressionless watches MACE use the cane

MACE
Practice with it In a day or two
maybe youll be strong enough to go
out to the garden with Sandra

MACE never even realizes how much danger he was in
CUT TO
INT OTHER ROOM - DAY - A LITTLE LATER

TODDs heavy boots come close to NATHAN the cane clumps down
just missing him

NATHAN looks up with open-mouthed innocence and childlike wonder
at TODD who looms past him walking very cautiously with the help
of a cane

TODD looks down at NATHAN Their eyes meet for a moment TODD
is wearing one of the heavy parkas the pioneers wear

SANDRA answers a KNOCK at the door opens it revealing ELLEN
the ten-year-old in the doorway Behind her are JOHNNY and
WILL as well as several other CHILDREN of various ages

ELLEN
I came for Nathan

But ELLENs eyes are on TODD and so are the others crowding
behind her to peep over her shoulder They all want to geta
look at TODD but when he looks in their direction they retreat
shyly

SANDRA is wearing a parka too She picks up NATHAN from where
hes sitting near TODDs feet and carries him to the door giving
him a kiss then handing him to ELLEN

NATHAN starts to cry and holds his arms out to his mother as
ELLEN hugs him and comforts him

TODD watches the drama as ELLEN and SANDRA comfort the child and
soothe his fears at being separated from his mother

Nothing shows in TODDs eyesbut affection seems to fascinate
him

As ELLEN and her cohorts hurry off with NATHAN they sneak over-
the-shoulder glances at the strange monster TODD

Just then MACE dressed in a heavy parka also comes out of the
bedroom and heads for the door

MACE

Single-file a dozen PIONEERS move along a trench as the wind
SCREAMS overhead

We DISCOVER the cane and boots of TODD among them The MAN in
front of TODD glances back at him occasionally curious while
MACE and SANDRA walk behind him

As they pass huts there are windows high in one sloping wall of
the trench TODD doesnt notice the distorted faces of the
CHILDREN peering out at him their noses pressed against the
plexiglass full of curiosity as we

confused at the wave then he salutes

MACE is startled by that He sort of grins as we

EXT GARDEN - DAY - LATER

A nasty little snake a ten-inch VIPER slithers through the dirt
among the neat rows of seedlings growing there until

SQUASH One neat blow from the sharp edge of a trowel
decapitates the VIPER
SANDRA flips the still wriggling thing aside and wipes her trowel
clean in the dirt as TODD watches with those blank snake eyes of
his

Theyre on all fours in a garden The garden is simply a much
wider trench covered by a trellis so the light can be regulated
There are already neat rows of vegetables are growing Behind
them kneeling PIONEERS are planting new seedlings and weeding
around more mature plants

SANDRA turns back to place a seedling in the dirt with only an
offhand glance at the dead VIPER

SANDRA
You have to watch out for them
They probably wouldnt kill someone
your size not if you were healthy
anyway But theyd make you pretty
sick Someone smallerlike me or
a child

Her meaning clear SANDRA continues to demonstrate to TODD how to
plant the seedling in the earth

SANDRA
In a month this one will be as big
as those

TODD follows her look to the other side of the trench where the
plants are already eighteen inches high

Other PIONEERS working on their hands and knees also are
sneaking glances as TODD among them a middle-aged woman named
JUDITH and an older woman EMMA

SANDRA frowns one of their looks away protectively as she selects
another seedling from a tray and hands it to TODD

SANDRA
Here You try one

TODD looks at it He doesnt exactly look scared but he handles
it gingerly seemingly intimidated by the delicate seedling He
starts to plant it carefully as we

Jabbering VOICES the click of utensils Heaping plates of food
are being passed the length of long tables set up in communal
style JOHNNY is kicking ELLEN under the table WILL flips a
piece of food at TOMMY when his mother ILONA isnt looking and
the outspoken SLADE is lecturing a pioneer named CHESTER

SLADE
You cant talk to a soldier no more
than you can talk to aabomb
Or a bullet Theyre trained
theyre killing machines They got
an objective and they go after that
objective and nothing stops them but
killing them

CHESTER
(a glance over his
shoulder)
Just one To kill us all

The conversation gets the attention of JOHNNY and WILL who stop
food-fighting to listen to the adults talk

SLADE
First off if theres one theres
more Thats how it is soldiers
travel in bunches Second they
dont waste soldiers on folks
like us thats for police Training
soldiers to kill weaklings like us
is not what they call cost
effective

CHESTER
Then who do they fight

SLADE
Other soldiers Theres a saying
Soldiers deserve soldiers

ANGLE ON ILONA noticing WILL and TOMMY listening

ILONA
Slade hush up

ANGLE ON TOMMY and WILL glancing toward the next table
ANGLE ON THE NEXT TABLE where TODD wedged between SANDRA and
MACE is eating like a machine looking neither right nor left as

people jabber all around him

ANGLE ON JUDITH whispering to EMMA at a nearby table as she
watches TODD eat

JUDITH
You see how much hes eating

ANGLE ON SLADE who turns now and boldly addresses TODD across the
gap between the tables

SLADE
I dont see how you can not remember

how you got here Sergeant

Theres a sudden hush in the noisy room broken only by a few
urgent whispers and a cough

TODD looks up from his food and meets SLADES look
SANDRA scowls at SLADE as SLADE persists
SLADE
Youre not a deserter are you
Sergeant

The silence is even more charged than before

SANDRA looks alarmed Someone coughs The tension is
unbearable

TODD
No sir

A sigh of relief from everybody But SLADE presses on

SLADE
Then how come youre not with your
unit

JIMMY PIG

Oh come on Slade let the man eat

SLADE
Its not an unreasonable question
(to Todd)
How about it Sergeant

ON TODD actually struggling with the question
remembering Suddenly he blurts

TODD
I wasreplaced

MACE
Replaced

TODD hesitates for half a second before answering
TODD
By a better soldier sir

TODD reaches for another seedling Hes one of a group of ten
PIONEERS all on their hands and knees all working intently

TODD is carefully patting the next seedling in the ground when
something causes him to look up

Five ENEMY SOLDIERS in torn and dirty uniforms are looming over
him weapons pointed at him All around them is a desert of sand
stretching forever under a baking sun

One of the soldiers kicks TODD

ANGLE ON EMMA JUDITH and several other PIONEER WOMEN exchanging
nervous glances as they look back to where TODDs kneeling

There are no soldiersbut somehow hes trampled several rows
of seedlings

TODD looks toward them confused disoriented by his memory
The women look away quickly frightened and we

INT OTHER ROOM - NIGHT

SANDRA is changing NATHANs diaper as she chatters her back to
TODD

SANDRA
And it got worse and worse My
father hadnt had any work in three
months andalsothere were other
thingsviolence political
feelings My father said hed heard
it was better in the Trinity moons
A lot of other people must have had
the same idea because the ship was
jammed with peoplemostly
families Thats probably why it
broke down overloaded

Across the room TODD wearing a T-shirt and baggy pants is
sitting on a stool his face impassive as ever

As SANDRA talks her back to him TODDs eyes are on the contours
of her body against the shift shes wearing Its veryerotic

SANDRA
Even after they made the repairs it
barely got off the ground it was an
old converted mining transport a
piece of junk to start with It
justdropped Maybe you saw
whats left of itout there in the
wind A lot of people died And we
couldnt make any radio contact
So we were stuck here Nobody was
happy about it A few years later
when the dumpers started coming over
and dropping stuff people tried to
get their attention with explosions
and fires But it didnt work
They must be unmannedor they just
dont care Maybe they think were
garbage too

TODDS face is as impassive as ever while his eyes caress the
shape of her bodyand she unaware continues to reminisce

SANDRA
So there really wasnt any choice
People had to pull together and make
the best of it We became a
community

As SANDRA maneuvers NATHAN TODD catches glimpses of her breasts
pushing against the material of the shift She continues still
not noticing where his attention is

SANDRA
One good thingnobody bothers us
Whod want to fight over a
godforsaken place like this

A wry laugh She turns to put NATHAN down on the floor and

INT CORRIDOR (AND MEETING ROOM) - DAY

The CHILDREN are peeking around a doorway watching something in
the meeting room

HAWKINS coming along the dirt-walled corridor spots the
CHILDREN ahead

HAWKINS
You children are supposed to be
doing lessons

The CHILDREN barely acknowledge her as she comes even with them
She looks at what theyre looking at

What theyre seeing through the doorway is TODD shirtless doing
an eerie sequence of tai chi exercises His muscular body
ripples revealing an incredible map of scar tissue that speaks
eloquently of the life hes ledgash marks long zippers of
stitches the puckered patches of burns

HAWKINS watches for a long moment her eyes worried

In the midst of a slow graceful movement TODD suddenly whirls
and delivers a lightning blow to an unseen enemy with amazing
speed and fury the terrible force contained in the movement all
too obvious

Even as HAWKINS and the CHILDREN gasp silently TODD returns to
the graceful almost balletic movement even spookier now that
preceded the deadly thrust

The CHILDRENs eyes are like saucers their jaws agape

HAWKINS shuddersand breaks the hypnotic spell speaking aloud
to the children

Its dark the winds HOWLING just above the trench walls as TODD
peers into a faintly lighted window in the wall of the trench

TODDS POV THROUGH THE BEDROOM WINDOW reveals a tender moment
between MACE and SANDRA as they enter the bedroom and kiss A
flickering candle on a low table the only light exaggerates
their shadows

ANGLE ON TODD his face revealing no feelings as he turns away

Light spills from other windows some more brightly lit as TODD
begins to jog along the trench gradually picking up speed until
hes running hard through intermittent pools of light in the maze
of dark trenches

EXT INSIDE A TRENCH

As MACE continues talking to TODD he loads the pockets of his
heavy parka with miscellaneous hunks of metal

MACE

(continuing)
Thats why were weighing down And
thats why were always on the wire
even when the winds down like now
You dont get much warning Here
load up youll want the weight I
promise

MACE hands heavy hunks of metal to TODD whos wearing a parka
like MACES He pockets the metal obediently

Behind them a small crowd of PIONEERS are doing the same JIMMY
PIG SLADE CHESTER RED a woman named SALLY and several OTHERS
In addition to the parkas they wear eskimo-style eye-protectors
and carry canteens tools and coils of rope attached to various
parts of their outfits
ANGLE ON MACE noticing TODD eyeing the rifle JIMMY PIG is
carrying

MACE

Oh were not going to shoot
anything Thats not what we mean
by hunting

(then laughing to

Jimmy Pig)
Jimmy Pig youre not going to shoot
anything are you

JIMMY PIG
(laughing)
What could I hit

MACE
(to Todd)
Its how we call for help Two
shots Therell be someone on duty
listening in case we get off the
wire and get lost or something We
have flares too Come on

Other are already climbing the ladder out of the trench to the
surface above as MACE urges TODD to follow

Cut TO

EXT STEEL HENGE - DAY

Its very still no wind The little group of PIONEERS is moving
along a wire that passes close to the towering ruins of the
wrecked spaceship They are tiny figures in the vast landscape

CLOSER ON TODD AND MACE as they plod along in the line of
PIONEERS MACE indicates the wreck off to the right

MACE

Sandra said she told you how we
wound up here Our parents and so
on

(turning left

indicating)
Over here we call these catcher
trenches

TODD follows his look to a long open trench leading apparently
nowhere

MACE
(continuing)
Smaller stuff that blows across the
ground it falls in these trenches
it works sort of like a filter We
go through the trenches sometimes
and get some good stuff

As they pass close along the trench TODD looks in and observes
the trench is knee deep in muddy water with rusty machine parts
and assorted junk protruding

MACE chuckles at the sight

MACE
We try to work em when theyre dry
Its lousy going in there when
theyre flooded You can see

A sudden SHOUT HEYYUP YO distracts them

TODD looks forward sees RED pointing to a chunk of steel a
hundred yards off the wire

ANGLE ON JIMMY PIG already fastening his safety rope and a
second rope to the wire then heading off toward the piece of
steel trailing the two ropes

ANGLE ON MACE explaining the procedure to TODD

MACE
Whatever looks useful if we can get
a rope to it well go for it But
you cant ever go further than your
safety line because itll come up on
you with sometimes maybe ten seconds
or even less

TODD is watching JIMMY PIG as he approaches the piece of steel
and starts to attach his rope to it

MACE
Like right now You hear that

TODD listens

Nothing at firstthen a very faint WHISTLING The sound he
heard that first night when he was on the settlement roof

MACE
Its close when you hear that

TODD can see JIMMY PIG Hes attached the rope to the steel and
he gives a signal

As PIONEERS start to haul on the line pulling the steel toward
them MACE shouts at JIMMY PIG

MACE
SHES GONNA BLOW JIMMY

JIMMY waves starts back toward them

MACE indicates for TODD to help haul the steel and the two of
them are just joining in the effort when

WHOOOOO00000 THE WIND IS SUDDEN AND FEROCIOUS IT STAGGERS
THEM

MACE
GRAB ON SERGEANT

TODD follows MACES example and like the others grabs the wire
and hangs on as the wind SCREAMS and tears at them

One of the pioneers CHESTER shouts points

They all see JIMMY PIG being blown faster than he can run his
legs churning desperately to keep up with his wind-propelled
body To no avail Hes suddenly airborne his legs still
churning like cartoon legs as he flaps helplessly at the end of
his safety tether like a kite fifty feet in the air

An eighty-pound steel barrel blows past tumbling in the wind
Bits of junk zip dangerously around like missiles

ANGLE ON THE PIONEERS crouched low on their knees against the
wind clutching the wire with one hand while they pull on JIMMY
PIGS safety line But the wind is too stronguntil suddenly
TODD is pulling and TODDS strength makes the difference
slowly JIMMY PIG is pulled toward themand Pioneers exchange
amazed glances at TODDS strength

As he pulls TODD notices what the others dont

ANGLE ON THE RIFLE dropped by JIMMY PIG ten yards away

ANGLE ON JIMMY PIG as hes hauled safely in to the group of
PIONEERS who clap him on the back and hug him CHESTER is
laughing so hard he can barely stand up as he tries to describe
and mimic JIMMYS desperate effort to outrun the force of the
wind

CHESTER
(shouting guffawing)
JIMMYRUNNINGCANTHA HA
CANTKEEP UP WITH HIMSELF
HA HA HA

CHESTER breaks off suddenly sober staring off and the others
turn to see what hes looking at Everybody stops laughing

ANGLE ON TODD carefully moving away from the wire to retrieve
the rifle The WIND is dropping off some enough to stand

ANGLE ON MACE and the other PIONEERS reacting with alarm at the
sight of TODD picking up the rifle

ANGLE ON TODD as he turns rifle in hand

TODDS POV of the PIONEERS staring at him the WIND diminishing
further

ANGLE ON TODD looking toward them Nothing shows on his face
ANGLE ON SLADE looking sour Trouble Just what he expected

ANGLE ON MACE taking a deep breath smiling as he moves toward
TODD holding out his free hand for the rifle

MACE
Uh thanks Sergeant Thanks a
lot

But MACE breaks off realizing that TODDS attention is
elsewhere

TODD is beyond MACE toward the landscape
MACE (and the other PIONEERS) turn to see what TODDS looking at
ANGLE ON THE JUNK MOUNTAINS in the distance several miles off
where hovering high above the junk mountains an ancient DUMPER
SHIP issues a steady stream of metal and concrete debris onto the
junk heaps far below The faint THUNDER of the refuse tumbling
onto the steep slopes is just audible over the SOUND of the wind
CLOSE ON TODD as realizes how he got here
ANGLE ON MACE reacting to TODDS intense interest
MACE
Dumpers They come every twenty or

thirty days

As TODD turns and looks at MACE MACE puts out his hand again for
the gun
TODD seems to notice the weapon in his hand for the first time
Unhesitatingly he hands the rifle to MACE

As MACE casually takes the weapon the PIONEERS breathe a sigh of
relief grinning again as the tension eases

TODD has turned his gaze back to the DUMPER SHIP fascinated So
thats what they did to him

Just then JIMMY PIG claps TODD heartily on the shoulder

JIMMY PIG
Thanks partner These no-goods
woulda just let me blow away

TODD reacting to the smack on his shoulder looks at JIMMY PIG
like what was that Are you hitting me

But all the PIONEERS are gathering around TODD in such a jovial
manner that the puzzled soldier sort of understands this isnt an
attack

youd got the transmission on the

Glowering at the monitor where MEKUMs badly transmitted VIDEO

hes holding in his hand a map showing hundreds of little dots
against a vast field stars and moons in the vast sea of space
RUBRICK and SLOAN watch as CHURCH addresses MEKUMs image
indignantly

CHURCH
We got it all right This is an
outpost here not the Third Army
Youve got us securing thirty-four
locations and erecting monitor units
in one month and --

MEKUM
(interrupting)
Piece of cake guys These are

totally remote totally uninhabited
territories All you do is set
down send out a patrol purely as a
formality then have those veterans
of yours put up an A-Type unmanned
monitoring unit You should be on
about number twenty-five by the time
I get back from my vacation

CHURCH
What if we do run into people
say squatters or refugees

MEKUM

(a frown)
Well you sure as hell dont want to
get involved in evacuating people
and that sort of thing

(then meaningfully)
My advice would be toavoid
paperwork

CHURCH
Eliminate them you mean

MEKUM
Well no ones out there but
officially these are hostile
zones Therefore youd be within
your rights to classify anyone as
hostile I think
But I repeat you should be worried
about boredom not action Any
other questions before I go

CHURCH hesitates SLOAN and RUBRICK look at him Then CHURCH
blurts a question his voice breaking

carrying a couple of half-empty bottles

SLOAN

Eyes riveted on the THREE OFFICERS the NEW SOLDIERS are
unresponsive to Christmas cheer In fact they look almost
angry like big dangerous animals as the three OFFICERS stagger
stupidly down the row of bunks every eye following them

But TODD spots NATHAN trying to pull his pull toy along so the

touches the strange water with his finger then studies the

MACE lunges from the bed

snatches the boy in his arms and yanks him away

SANDRA sits up in bad looking around alarmed
MACE is holding NATHAN staring down at the VIPER

buffets him

catcher trenches toward the mountains of junk towering over the
flat landscape several miles off

A heavy barrel blows by then an old refrigerator tumbles past
MACE squints into the wind

Off to the right about a quarter mile away he can see a big piece

see TODDs face as he SHOUTS at him

TODD watches him come

MACE stumbles on dances a few feet recovers struggles toward

TODD WERE SORRY WE WERE WRONG

Just then a sharp gust staggers MACE driving him several yards
toward a catcher trench

Hes teetering on the lip of the flooded trench about to fall
in when TODDS strong arms grab him

They look like a strange four-footed beast as TODD drags him
through the wind in an awkward embrace toward the cable

Once MACE has the cable in his hands he laughs and gasps
MACE
Damn Thank you Todd God damn
I almost took a aswim there

MACE breaks off Todd isnt listening hes looking off toward
the horizon

TODD meets his look but doesnt answer He finishes the
tourniquet and turns his back on MACE to peer out through a gap
in the engine at the CRAWLER

TODD sees the CRAWLER approach the cable watches it veer left
and start to travel along the cablestraight toward the colony

TODD turns and looks into MACEs face MACEs eyes are clouded
with horror

to the floor of the trench

But hes a super soldier so that almost at the same time he hits
the ground hes already lunging upward to regain his feet and
fight except

A knife blade rips across his throat opening it wide in one
swift movement and

The THIRD SOLDIERs head sags back because not even superman can
fight with no neck and the last thing he sees through his plexi

Surrounding him on the floor in neat piles are the rocket rifles

pulls on boots Then he pulls a jersey over his muscular torso
covering all the old scars the tattooed names of battles and
the tourniquet on his arm

Staring at him with glazed eyes SANDRA notices a blotch of blood
form on the jersey leaking through the tourniquet She speaks
numbly

SANDRA
Your woundits still bleeding

Stuffing his pockets with ammo and other items TODD glances at
her with eyes that glitter dangerously
TODD
I like to bleed sir

SANDRA stares at him stupidly as he continues to dress pulling
on a heavy armored vest

SANDRA
It doesnthurt

TODD pulls on a second armored vast one that already has a
ragged hole in it from a rocket

TODD
Not enough sir

SANDRA watches him go to the heap of charred furniture in the
corner and take a blackened stick from it watches him smear
charcoal under his eyes
SANDRA
How do you know theyll come back

TODD looks at her a savage with blackened eyes

TODD
Theyre soldiers sir Like me

SANDRA

TODD
Nothing
SANDRA

TODD
They are obeying orders sir Its

For a moment SANDRA is silent then

TODD crosses two utility belts across his armored chest like
bandoliers

TODD

No
His voice is soft as silk but hard as steel She looks into his
eyes Does she detect a hint of approval of respect in those

flat expressionless snake eyes

SANDRA
Why not

TODD turns to go laden with weapons a flamethrower on his back
a rocket rifle on his shoulder another in one hand

he looms closer to then heading for the door The two of then
shrink hastily out of his way

Stepping into the trench TODD hears the wind SCREAM overhead
He approaches crude steps dug in the side of the trench and
begins to pull himself up into the wind

As he climbs the SCREAMING wind changes pitch radically and by
the time he bellies over the lip of the trench the wind is only
a breeze

Getting to his feet and finds even the breeze is dying replaced
by a terrible stillness

As TODD looks off into the darkness a voice calls to him from
the trench behind biz

TODD turns back looking down into the trench and sees SANDRA
looking up at him

SANDRA

TODD looks at her for a long moment his face a mask before he
nods almost imperceptibly Her eyes are full of tears

SANDRA

SANDRA is reacting to vague movement in the shadows beyond the

She puts her hand over the mouth of a whimpering CHILD hushes
another

A timber falls outside the door and SANDRA sees a shadowy shape
enter the meeting room looming in the darkness

Frightened CHILDREN hold their breath peer out fearfully

CRACK SMASH The huge shape hurls aside the debris in his way
switches on a flashlight probes the darkness

The light wipes the damaged room
Suddenly SANDRA gasps

ANGLE ON RED summoning all his courage raising his rifle

ANGLE ON CAINE 607 reacting looking toward RED

ANGLE ON RED scared to death firing again And again

ANGLE ON CAINE 607 wrenching a heavy door from its hinges and
holding it in front of him shielding himself from REDs
continuous shooting advancing

ANGLE ON RED firing again and againand backing up

ANGLE ON CAINE 607 holding the doorshield as he advances on RED

Backing RED trips goes down flat on his back
CAINE 607 only six feet away hurls the door at him

RED shoves the door aside aims his gun up at CAINE 607 as the
huge soldier looms over him

Before RED can pull the trigger CAINE 607 snatches the rifle
barrel and yanks the weapon out of REDS hands

RED rolls scrambles to his feet

And CAINE 607 clubs him to the ground with the butt of the rifle
crushes his skull with three brutal blows
INT ROOM

TODDS impassive face somehow reveals the alarm and awkwardness

he feels at whats happening to him

TOMMY is seated on his

shoulders hes got NATHAN in one arm and JOHNNY is nervously
looking up at him as he clutches at TODDS huge free hand and
now a little girl SARAH clutches at his combat pants as SANDRA

instructs her

Clutching TODDs combat pants fiercely

SANDRA
Sarah you hang on to Sergeant Todd
No matter what happens

the big stonefaced man as SANDRA turns to ELLEN

SANDRA
Ellen go to the Commons Tell
Jimmy Pig and Mr Slade that
Sergeant Todd says we have to leave
as soon as they get everybody out of
the root-cellar Can you do that

ELLEN
(scared)
Uh yes maam

SANDRA
Its all right The soldiers are
gone for now But be careful where
you walk And if its too smoky
just come back

SARAH
(on her way out)
Yes maam

SANDRA

(calling after her)
Tell them to bring all the food and
clothing they can carry

(turning to the

children)
Do you all understand that Sergeant
Todd here is going to help us and
whatever he says to do you must do
immediately as if he was your
father or your mother

SARAH
(tears)
Hes not my father

SARAH looks up timidly at
ANGLE ON TODDS stone face Unfamiliar territory

SANDRA
No but hes our friend Our good
friend Do you understand

Frightened faces look to the awkward killing machine
TODD looks like a statue decorated with CHILDREN

JOHNNY is sobbing as he hangs onto TODDs giant hand obediently
JOHNNY
I want my father and my mother Can
he find where my father is I want
him to find my father

SANDRA
No No he cant do that but --

A SCREAM From the corridor

SANDRA freezes TODD is alert tenseand covered with
CHILDREN

SANDRA turns and runs for the door as TODD starts to put the
CHILDREN down But hes awkward slow not his usual graceful
self trying to be gentle like a clumsy man handling breakables

INT CORRIDOR

Bursting into the corridor SANDRA sees ELLEN racing toward her
weaving through broken beams SCREAMING as CAINE 607 lumbers

after her out of the shadows CAINE 607 doesnt bother to avoid
obstacles shoving beams aside like twigs dragging his bad leg

SANDRA
Sergeant Todd

ELLEN dives into SANDRAs arms and SANDRA turns only three steps
ahead of CAINE 607 and rushes into the meeting room

INT MEETING ROOM

TODD is just putting NATHAN gently on the floor when he sees
CAINE 607 arrive in the doorway For halt a second their eyes
meet then --

CAINE 607 advances on TODD

Still encumbered by CHILDREN clutching at him TODD sees his
weapons but cant get to them Then its too late
The terrified CHILDREN watch as the giant CAINE 607 clubs TODD
mercilessly with the rifle butt then hurls him backwards like a
rag doll

Horrified SANDRA sees TODD slam into a wall slump to the floor
Dismissing TODD CAINE 607 turns looms toward the CHILDREN

SANDRA
THEYRE JUST CHILDREN

CAINE 607 ignores her heads for ELLEN dragging his bad leg

Spotting TODDS weapons SANDRA snatches a heavy rocket rifle
brings it up awkwardly points it FIRES

And the kick from the heavy gun sends SANDRA sprawling back the
weapon trembling from her hands

But the WHIZZING ROCKET a near miss gets CAINE 607s attention
He turns away from ELLEN toward SANDRA

ANGLE ON TODD rising to his knees blinking stupidly trying to
focus as blood pours into his eyes from a gash in his forehead

TODDS POV a vague unfocused image of SANDRA snatching a
bayonet from TODDS gear on the floor and lunging courageously at
CAINE 607

Vaguely TODD sees CAINE 607 parry her thrust effortlessly and
grab her As she beats at CAINE 607 bravely with her fists the
big man slams her into a wall brutally As she crumples he hits
her again

ANGLE ON TODD struggling to his feet staggering as he shakes his
head to clear it

His eyes go to SANDRA slumped against the wall bloody

Terrified CHILDREN look up at CAINE 607 as he towers over them
Suddenly

SHTUNK A knife blade suddenly sticks in CAINE 607s neck

CAINE 607 only flinches and as he YANKS the knife from his
neck by the handle he turns to see who threw the blade

WHAM TODD slams into him tackling him driving his big
shoulder deep into the new soldiers waist slamming the big man
hard into a wall
Air goes out of CAINE 607 the knife drops from his hand

But thats it for TODDs victory Six-five two-sixty CAINE 607
is bigger and stronger than TODD His powerful arms rip TODD off
him like hes taking off a Band-Aid

Terrified wide-eyed CHILDREN watch TODD hurled back across the
room

TODD scrambles to his feet shakes his head clear
Here comes CAINE 607 dragging his bad leg

TODD attacks Combining a martial arts feint and lunge with a
vicious kick

But 607 counters expertly brushing aside the attack
TODD lunges again employing yet another skilled move

SMACK CAINE 607 outmaneuvers TODD again punishing him
brutally

WHACK WHAM SMASH CRUNCH This time TODD jolts the bigger
man with a terrible combination of moves smashing him in the
Adams apple kicking him in the knee driving an elbow into the
jaw

This time its CAINE 607 who has to back away to recover And
now he seems to re-consider TODD revealing for the first time a

genuine respect

As their eyes meet CAINE 607 seems to be saying All right then
youre serious lets do it fella

TODD lunges
SMASH CAINE 607 creams him
TODD twists slams CAINE 607 back
BASH A fist to the face
UMMMMMPH A knee in a groin
SLAM A head against a wall

are almost swollen shut as he looks up at CAINE 607 kneeling on
top of him Both men are bloody and exhausted their breath
coming in gasps but its CAINE 607 whos on top beating the
last bit of resistance out of TODD who struggles desperately one
more timebefore he slumps unconscious

Horrified NATHAN sees CAINE 607 smash the unconscious TODD with
the last of his strength finishing him off NATHAN cant
stand it

He toddles toward CAINE 607 whos still on all fours and
attacks his tiny fists raining blows on the amazed monsters
bloody face

The frightened CHILDREN see CAINE 607 ignore NATHANs ineffectual
blows and struggle with enormous effort to his feet

Once standing he looks down at NATHAN beating at his knees For
a moment hes confused Whats this

Then he sees the frightened CHILDREN and orients himself When
he looks down at NATHAN again tiny NATHAN is an enemy as good as
dead One blow and
But just then big hands close around CAINE 607s ankles tackling
him As the giant topples TODD lets go of the ankles and crawls
on top of the fallen man

As CAINE 607 looks up into TODDs fierce face the fight goes out
of his eyes He knows hes beaten he knows TODD will never
quit Hes helpless as TODD grips him in a terrible hold and as
TODD puts the pressure on CAINE 607 whispers

CAINE 607
It hurts
TODD

I know

SNAP TODD breaks CAINE 607s neck and watches the life go out
of him

enemy he hears a VOICEher VOICEvery weak

more blood in her hair Her eyes dont look right

Struggling to his feet TODD picks up NATHAN and puts the boy
down close to his mother

SANDRA reaches out and takes NATHANs hand She holds NATHANs
hand toward TODD

TODD looks confused

There are tears in SANDRAs eyes as she pushes NATHANs little
hand into TODDs huge left paw

TODD looks down at the joined hands then he looks into SANDRAs
flooded eyes

Does TODD understand her gesture His face is impassive Maybe
he doesnt Just then a hand touches his shoulder

TODD turns to see JOHNNY face him trembling but valiant to ask
the question the others are fearful of asking

NATHAN keeps going toddling toward a hatchway

him with blank faces He is alone again

NATHAN totters onward

CLOSE ANGLE ON CHARTS the same ones Church had on Christmas Eve
showing tiny dots in a vast sea of space
TODD and RILEY are poring over them their eyes considering dot
after dot Finally TODD points to a dot and looks a question at
RILEY

RILEY considers the dot for a long momentthen he looks TODD in
the eye

RILEY
Cold

TODD looks back at the dot considers it looks back at RILEY

RILEY nods a yes
TODD is thoughtfulfinally asks the next question

But very cold
TODD considers the dot on the map again then looks at RILEY

TODD
That one

RILEY
Aye aye sir

RILEY turns toward a console but something makes him look down
toward his feat Then he looks back at TODD

TODD follows the look
Tiny NATHAN is looking up at TODD whos towering over him

TODD looks down without expression the scarf from Jimmy Pig
still wrapped around his neck

NATHAN puts his arms out to be picked up
TODD considers the outstretched arms
RILEY looks from TODD to NATHAN and back to TODD Whats this

TODD hesitates a half second more then leans down and picks
NATHAN up in his arms lifting the boy to his chest

RILEY looks on Never seen anything like it

NATHAN is close to TODDs face looking right into it trying a
little smile a nervous one looking for a response

TODD hesitates takes a breath moves the muscles of his face

All he can produce is an awkward grimace the distortion of a
smile almost comical

NATHAN reads the intention successfully His face collapses into
a huge friendly grin

TODD tries again making a clumsy sort of rubbery wince
RILEY watches Totally amazed
TODD turns takes NATHAN to a porthole puts his face up to it

NATHAN stares out at the darkness punctuated by a billion stars
a sky full of hope

As NATHAN looks out TODD works his face again trying for a
smile the way a weak man might try to lift a heavy weight

NATHAN looks at the stars outside TODD looks with him and
suddenly TODDs face relaxes into an awkward grin almost by
accident

RILEY watches the two of them for a moment confounded by what
hes seeing Then he turns to the console and

THE CLOSING CREDITS ROLL
