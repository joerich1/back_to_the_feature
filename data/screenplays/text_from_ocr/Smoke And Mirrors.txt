Based on a true story
FADE IN
Darkness A black night sky
Suddenly a blast of FIRE shoots across the screen

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

EXT KABYLE CAMPSITE SAHARA DESERT NIGHT

A crazed FIRE-EATER swallowing a blazing torch Again he BLOWS THE
FLAME out of his mouth

CONTINUE PULLBACK

Were on a stony hillside Hundreds of KABYLE TRIBESPEOPLE are in
a hypnotic frenzy all around us They dance and stagger in
clusters before a 20-foot high bonfire tearing their robes and
wailing in their worship to the god of destruction Angry DRUMS
and exotic dissonent FLUTES whip them into a fever

Each cluster of Tribespeople surrounds a half-naked glassy-eyed
DERVISH We PAN past the first Dervish -- the FIRE-EATER -- to
further weirdness

A SECOND DERVISH who stabs three sharp spikes through his forearm
without showing any pain

As a THIRD DERVISH walks across a bed of hot coals

Suddenly a HOWLING OF JACKALS The Kabyles join in rising to their
feet in fear and awe looking towards the bonfire The drums and
music pound faster and louder

SLOW ZOOM TO
the interior of the flames where a DARK ROBED FIGURE appears
ZOOM CLOSER

as the dark figure lifts his head and raises his arms into the air
He steps out of the fire unsinged and throws back his hood We
stare directly into the burning evil eyes of the Marabout ZORAS
AL KHATIM the chief sorcerer of the tribe

The mob hushes instantly at a single wave of Zoras hand Zoras
thunders his demonic message

ZORAS
(in Berber)
I have been to the heavenly place I
have passed through the fire I have
seen your victory - victory to the
Kabyle nation

Ecstatic war cries from the crowd Zoras quiets them again

ZORAS
(in Berber)
The white-skinned devils who occupy
our land will die How horribly they
die you must choose Show no mercy

War DRUMS pound The Warriors rise to their feet with bloodthirsty
chanting and screaming Many whirl convulsively out of control as

if possessed by demons Zoras surveys the chaos with a wicked
satisfied smile

As the people yowl in response Zoras steps back toward the fire
and VANISHES in an EXPLOSION of flame and smoke

MATCH CUT TO
A cloud of dust
PULL BACK TO REVEAL
EXT - TEE EDGE OF THE SAHARA DESERT DAY
The dust is being kicked up by a HORSE ridden by

CAPTAIN TREY DARCY an intense young expatriate American an
officer of the French Foreign Legion

Even after an arduous journey across a hellish wasteland Darcy
“sits tall and alert in the saddle He wears a single WHITE GLOVE
on his left hand which holds the reins of his horse

SUPER TITLE “Algeria - August 1856°

A troop of 17 Legionnaires follows Darcy in ragged spread-out
formation Each soldier is an unshaven mess parched and listless
in the North African heat

Far ahead lie forbidding mountains Behind them endless desert

An oversized stallion lumbers up alongside the Captain The rider
is a hulking bull of a Spaniard -- CORPORAL AUGUSTINO BARTOLOTE

BARTOLOTE
How much longer to Biskra Captain

DARCY
I thought you wanted a life of
adventure Bartolote

Suddenly the sound of GUNSHOTS in the distance The Legionnaires
-instantly come alert all eyes on Darcy for orders

DARCY
Fall in Check your weapons

An amazing transformation occurs Seconds ago the soldiers looked
like death warmed over Yet at Darcys command their fatigue
miraculously vanishes and they fall into a tight battle formation

DARCY
Legionnaires After me

Darcy gallops ahead towards the still continuing gunfire his
troops following

EXT - OASIS AT BISKRA DAY

Thundering HOOFBEATS A Kabyle Warrior on horseback charges
directly toward us scimitar raised a scream of death on his lips
The scimitar sweeps down --

and DECAPITATES an overdressed French gentleman still aiming a
wavering pistol at his killer As his severed head rolls across
the sand the dead mans body collapses

All around a small caravan of French civilians tries to hide
behind overturned wagons and a handful of nearby palm trees as

100 Kabyle Warriors on horseback attack savagely Thirty or so
French gentlemen and a few ladies lie dead on the banks of the oasis

The remaining men ill-equipped for warfare fire pistols at their
attackers with little success

The women and children huddle in the wagons some trying to shoot
others praying and crying as the Kabyles turn for another attack

Then a BUGLE CALL

Its the Foreign Legion troop Darcy leading vastly outnumbered
But they gallop over the crest of the dune without hesitation
rifles out bayonets fixed

Half the Kabyles whirl to attack the Legionnaires -- and begin to
fall as a RIFLE BARRAGE hits them The Legionnaires shoot and
slash with a near-suicidal fervor

Darcy draws his sword and rides into the thick of combat In an
unstoppable frenzy he slashes his way through the Kabyle ranks to
reach the civilians

By the overturned wagons a young French mother her arms around
her two children -- a boy and girl -- pleads with her attacker

FRENCH MOTHER
Theyre only children Three years
old six years old Please -- you
must have children of your own

But the attacker only aims his rifle at the woman a wicked grin
on his face He shoots

The Mother looks down in disbelief as blood billows out across her
midsection A second later she falls dead Her children scream

As the Attacker raises his scimatar to dispatch the children a
PISTOL SHOT rings out

The Attacker seizes up in a convulsion his arms outstretched
towargs the sky The scimitar falls from his hand

ANGLE PAST ATTACKER
to Darcy pistol in hand galloping up to the spot as the Attacker dies

Behind him in the distance the last of the Kabyles ride away
Some of the Legionnaires pursue still shooting

Darcy dismounts and looks around in horror All around him
slaughtered women and children lie in pools of blood surrounded
by overturned wagons and dead horses
Bartolote and other Legionnaires approach but stop short as they
see the extent of the massacre The surviving children run to
grab Bartolotes legs -- something solid to hold on to

BARTOLOTE

(sickened)

Holy Mary Mother of Jesus

FOLLOW DARCY

stepping over corpses to the edge of the field of slaughter He
watches the dust of the fleeing Kabyles with wrathful eyes

DISSOLVE TO
EXT - PARIS SUBURB HOUDINS ESTATE DAY

A horse-drawn carriage clatters down a gravel lane past rows of
gated estates

SUPER TITLE paris - One month later

The driver -- a French Army private -- pulls the horse up at a set
of wrought iron gates and jumps down to open the carriage door for
COLONEL JULES GASTINOT a French Army functionary

Gastinot tries the gates Theyre locked He rattles the bars in
frustration then looks for the bell No bell

But affixed to the left gatepost is a brass plate with a grotesque
knocker in the shape of a demons head The brass plate is
engraved with the word ‘Frappez

Gastinot obeys the sign and raps the knocker

GASTINOTS POV

The word Frappez vanishes In its place magically appears the
inscription ‘Entrez

The locks click loudly To the Colonels surprise the heavy
gates creepily swing open by themselves

Gastinot looks suspiciously at the knocker runs his finger
gingerly over the brass plate -- then enters
EXT - HOUDINS ESTATE DAY

Gastinot walks up the long carriage driveway toward an elegant
17th century mansion

INT - HOUDINS ENTRYWAY DAY
HIGH SHOT

looking down three stories to an elegant foyer as Gastinot steps
inside An aged Manservant closes the door and takes the
Colonels hat and coat

The lady of the house glides in to greet Gastinot

COLETTE ROBERT-HOUDIN in her 30s is radiantly pretty Though
she looks every inch the rich mans spoiled wife she is matter-of-
fact sharply intelligent and kind

Gastinot bows over Colettes hand We hear Gastinot and Colette
speak faintly as if from several rooms away

GASTINOT
Madame Robert-Houdin May I present
myself -- Colonel Jules Gastinot
attaché to Foreign Minister Béjart

COLETTE
We received your letter sir

GASTINOT
Is Monsieur Robert-Houdin available

COLETTE
He is here Whether he is available
is another matter

INT - STAIRWAY DAY

Colette leads Gastinot up a grand marble staircase Hanging on
the wall are many framed theatrical posters and playbills
advertising performances by the legendary magician Robert-Houdin

COLETTE
I must warn you My husband is a bit
distracted these days

GASTINOT
The eccentricities of genius I quite
understand

COLETTE

I doubt that you do

INT - HALLWAY DAY
Colette and Gastinot arrive at the end of a long corridor

COLETTE
Please pardon any mess He wont let
the maids set foot inside this room
Colette raps at the workshop door
COLETTE
Husband Colonel Gastinot is here
From the Foreign Office
VOICE BEHIND DOOR
(grouchy )
Im busy Ask him to wait

COLETTE
For how long

VOICE BEHIND DOOR
(a beat) A week

Gastinot is startled Colette shakes the doorknob Its locked
COLETTE

Jean-Pierre If you dont unlock this

door Ill just go get the other key
Silence Seconds later the lock clicks loudly She turns the
knob and pushes the door open A cacophony of odd CLICKING and
WHIRRING sounds begins
INT - WORKSHOP DAY

The CLICKING and WHIRRING grow louder as Colette leads Gastinot
in Gastinot stares at the chaos around him aghast

GASTINOTS POV
The workshop is a lunatic inventors playpen
PAN STILL GASTINOTS POV

To Gastinots right a small MECHANICAL FIGURE -- a servant holding a
tray with liqueur glasses -- steps forward bows then steps back

A pair of near-life-sized mechanical AUTOMATONS sit playing chess

A tiny MECHANICAL MAN holds up a chair on which another mechanical
man performs acrobatic tricks

Elsewhere myriads of CLOCKS click away while other partially
completed mechanical figures move at random ELECTRICAL ARCS
sparking between their unconnected parts

Completing the mess is a litter of books papers loose mechanical
parts wiring and clunky 50-pound batteries

But theres no sign of anyone in the room Whoever the ‘voice
was hes vanished

lat toseth tohnetalt

GASTINOT
Where did he go I distinctly heard-

COLETTE
Im sorry Colonel He does this all
the time when he doesnt want to be
sociable

Colette walks over to a standing full-length mirror only three inches
deep in the middle of the room She sternly lectures the mirror

COLETTE
Jean-Pierre Come out of there

Do we hear a faint grumble Maybe Colette stamps her foot

COLETTE
Now
The mirrorturns pitch black and JEAN-PIERRE ROBERT-HOUDIN steps
through the darkened mirror into the room wiping his hands with a

rag The mirror instantly becomes just a mirror again

HOUDIN
How do you do Colonel

Houdin is a handsome polished gentleman in his 50s He radiates
lightning intelligence plus the impatient cockiness that comes
from being used to success

Gastinot doubting his sanity circles the entire mirror frame
taps the mirror with his fingertips

GASTINOT
Impossible How in the world

HOUDIN
A private joke I grew tired of
ignorant critics theorizing all my
tricks were done with mirrors So I
decided to design one that was

Houdin curtly turns to his work table Gastinot still amazed by
the trick mirror forces his attention back on the business at hand

GASTINOT

Monsieur permit me to describe the
gravity of the Algerian situation The
thought is that if you were to do some
of the feats of magic for which you are
so justly renowned then explain that
they are all just (glancing doubtfully
at the mirror) illusions the people
following these self-styled magicians
would realize they are being fooled-

HOUDIN
(interrupting)
Yes yes I read your letter No

GASTINOT
(startled)
Perhaps I didnt make myself clear
The Foreign Minister himself requests --

HOUDIN
And I respectfully decline I will not
be used as an instrument of political
propaganda I regret youve made a trip
for no purpose Madame Robert-Houdin
will see you out Good day

Gastinot dogs after him unable to comprehend the rebuff

GASTINOT
Perhaps if you understood the evil
these sorcerers are fomenting among
the tribes the sheer barbarity their
black magic incites against your brother
countrymen even women and children
Surely as a concerned Christian -

HOUDIN
Colonel Are you hard of hearing

GASTINOT
I cannot believe a gentleman would
turn his back on his fellow citizens

Houdin thwacks his palm on the desk and explodes out of his chair

ROUDIN
Why in Gods name do you think I can
manage what the French Army and
Foreign Legion cannot

GASTINOT
(a true believer)
Because you are the great Robert-Houdin
You can do anything

HOUDIN
Colette tell this man what a washed-up
fraud I am

COLETTE
Im afraid hes right Colonel Why anyone
would admire my husband is beyond me

GASTINOT
No Sir you are a living legend
The greatest magician of all time--

HOUDIN
Stop This (with distaste) legend
you speak of JI created it J sustained
it Like everything else it was an
illusion A lie Thats what magic is
Deceit raised to its highest levels

(CONTI

GASTINOT
You cannot deny your accomplishments

HOUDIN
I gd2 deny them Manipulating the laws
of physics on one hand twisting
peoples minds on the other -- Its
not a fit way to make a living

GASTINOT
Sir you are wrong What you do is
true art

Houdin tries again to drive his point into this numbskulls brain

HOUDIN
Youre not listening My life now is
devoted to science Thats real Thats
worth pursuing (gesturing around)
Here in this room I discover truth

He gestures expansively around the room

HOUDIN
Electricity Chemistry Optics
Whatever days I have left Im not
going to waste doing card tricks for
Barbarian primitives in the God-
forsaken desert just to prove that my
brand of lying is superior to their
brand of lying No Colonel Im not
the man you seek

e The debate is ended Houdin goes back to work Gastinot shaken and
attempting to maintain his dignity bows formally Houdin ignores him

GASTINOT
Ill carry your sentiments to the
Foreign Minister

HOUDIN
(without looking up)
Please do

GASTINOT
In the meantime the butchery in
Algeria goes on I had hoped to have
appealed to your conscience Please
pardon my intrusion on your important
work Good day

Gastinot bows and exits Colette scowls at her husband He feels
her disapproval

HOUDIN
j I have my reasons

Colette turns on her heel and coldly exits

Now alone Houdin gazes down at the mechanical figure hes working
on a cavorting harlequin

The absurdity of the figure -- not exactly a stunning example of
pure science -- seems to strike home to Houdin Something in his
eyes hardens for a second then softens again He sets the

harlequin down gently

INT - HOUDIN ENTRYWAY DAY

The Manservant hands Gastinot his hat and coat then opens the
door Colette escorts the Colonel to the threshold

GASTINOT
I heard hed become foul-tempered I
had no idea

COLETTE
Ever since he gave up the stage he has
become I wish we could help you

Houdins strong voice barks out commandingly from above

HOUDIN
Colonel Gastinot

Startled Gastinot and Colette look up to see Houdin calling down
from the second floor railing

HOUDIN
If I were to go to North Africa as you
request would I have the complete
support of the Republic

GASTINOT
Monsieur Houdin I thought you said--

HOUDIN
I will not undertake any task that is
doomed to failure from the start
because of asinine bureaucracy and
lack of nerve Is that clear

Gastinot falls all over himself to agree surprised and delighted

’ GASTINOT
On behalf of the Foreign Minister I
can personally promise you a free hand

HOUDIN
To do the job as I see fit With no
outside interference

GASTINOT
You have my word on it Anything you
need Tell me Monsieur why the
change of heart

Houdin trots vigorously down the stairs
HOUDIN
That is my business When does this
ship of yours set sail
GASTINOT
The 23rd of September The steamer
EXT - MEDITERRANEAN SEA DAY
GASTINOT (VO cont)
Alexander® out of Marseilles

Ill book you a first class stateroom

COLETTE (V0)
For beth of us

The steamship Alexanders big paddlewheels amidships each side
plow through choppy seas

INT - STATEROOM THE ALEXANDER DAY

Houdin rehearses sleight-of-hand drills as the ship pitches and rolls

beneath him The cabin is plush and spacious all mahogany and brass

Colette stands still wearing a mans suit with tiny bells sewn on
all over Houdin walks past and quick as a blink darts his hand
into one of her pockets to filch a gold coin

The bells jingle Colette slaps his hand

HOUDIN
Blast it

COLETTE
Losing our touch are we

She holds out her palm for the coin
HOUDIN
Its not my fault The damn floor
keeps moving

He flips the coin back Colette drops it deep in her pocket

COLETTE
I hear the natives cut off the hands
of pickpockets By my count youve
lost that hand 18 times

HOUDIN
I dont need the lecture Again

He stomps past her back to his starting position He turns around
and smugly holds up the coin

HOUDIN
Is this better

Colette dives her hand into her pocket jangling the bells The
pocket is empty She smiles broadly Just then a KNOCK at the door

SHIPS CAPTAIN (0S)

INT - SHIPS CORRIDOR DAY
The SHIP CAPTAIN knocks again

EXT THE BOW OF THE ‘ALEXANDER DAY
SHIP CAPTAIN
There she is folks Algiers Land
of the Mohammedans God help us all

Colette properly dressed again with Houdin and Gastinot behind
her takes a spyglass from the Captain and adjusts it to her eye

COLETTE
Oh my

SPYGLASS POV

Still far off the Algiers of 1856 glistens under the bright African
sun Palm trees against clear azure skies Recent French
architecture mingles with whitewashed native buildings centuries old

ZOOM THROUGH THE SPYGLASS TO

EXT - ALGIERS HARBOR DOCKSIDE DAY

The piers a beehive of activity Black stevedores unload cargo
from docked boats Arabs and French mill around in the confusion
A babble of conflicting languages everywhere

A longboat ferrying Houdin Colette and Gastinot docks at the
pier In the bg the Alexander is anchored far out in the bay

EXT - DOWNTOWN ALGIERS DAY

A caravan of 4 horse-drawn carriages loaded with trunks and crates
threads through a hot crowded noisy bazaar

As Houdin Colette and Gastinot ride past in the lead carriage
Arab merchants wave exotic goods -- silks flutes hookahs carpets
even a live snake Strains of discordant Middle-Easern MUSIC and
DRUMS add to the exoticism and confusion
EXT - DOWNTOWN ALGIERS ANOTHER STREET DAY

Beggars and peddlers run alongside the lead carriage clamoring
for attention Houdin follows Gastinots example in ignoring
them Wilting in the heat Colette fans her perspiring face

HOUDIN
Whats being done about publicity
(gesturing back at the carriages)
Ive brought handbills posters--

GASTINOT
Have no fear the theatre will be packed
The Marshal-Governor will see to that

HOUDIN
(to Colette wryly)
Where was he in Vienna

COLETTE
Colonel Is there a bath in my future
any time soon

GASTINOT
“Im sure you will find everything you
could wish for at the Hotel DOrient

HOUDIN
In his letter the Foreign Minister
singled out one particular native
sorcerer as the chief cause of trouble

GASTINOT
Ah yes That would be Zoras al Khatim
If you were to prove him a charlatan
the political impact would be enormous
We cannot compel him to attend your
magic show But Im very sure he knows
you are here His spies are everywhere

INT - HOTEL DORIENT LOBBY DAY

A grand attempt to bring Paris direct to Africa Lush carpets
velvet divans gaslight chandeliers

Houdin and Gastinot chat while Colette melting in the heat keeps a
watchful eye on Porters hauling trunks up a curving staircase

The hum of activity in the lobby keeps us from hearing the mens
conversation Suddenly Colette whirls around at something Gastinot
says responding loudly enough to be heard by all

COLETTE
Seven
INT - HOUDINS HOTEL SUITE DAY

The sumptuous French-style suite contrasts drastically with the
white Moorish architecture seen just outside the balcony window

(Corrtanten)

Colette flurries around the suite distraught directing the
unpacking as two uniformed Arab SERVANTS do her bidding Houdin
emerges from the bathroom freshening his face with a wet towel

COLETTE
Monsieurs luggage can wait Start with
that one (to Houdin) How could you

possibly agree to dinner at seven I
have to bathe my gown has to be aired
out and pressed I need to curl my hair--

She grimaces at her bedraggled reflection in the dressing-table mirror

COLETTE (cont)
--if it will curl in this heat at all
(to the servants) Does the hotel have
a trained ladys maid

SERVANT
Yes Madame--

COLETTE
Well thats something Where are
my hatboxes

She begins pulling hairpins and curling papers out of her trunk
while Houdin hands a Servant his wet towel

COLETTE
You men have no idea

Houdin gives her a curt peck on the cheek on his way to the door

HOUDIN
Im sure youll be lovely Ill be
back in plenty of time

COLETTE
Where are you going

HOUDIN
The theatre I need to see what kind of
fleatrap Gastinot has saddled me with

COLETTE
Husband We just--

HOUDIN
I‘ll send up the maid

‘And hes gone before she can throw a handful of hairpins at him

EXT - HOTEL DORIENT DAY

Houdin steps outside to a row of taxi carriages at the curb
Instantly hes surrounded by a babble of Arab cabbies all
vehemently pitching themselves as the best in town Houdin grabs
the wrist of a 14-year-old BOY CABBIE

(

HOUDIN
You

The Boy Cabbie pulls Houdin to his taxi

EXT - OPERA HOUSE DAY

The carriage pulls to a stop before an ornate Parisian-style opera
house Houdin jumps out of the taxi and pays the Cabbie to wait
INT - OPERA HOUSE DAY

Deserted and quiet the only light coming from exit doors propped
open to the outside

Houdin walks onstage and looks around To him the theatre -- any
theatre -- is holy ground

In his minds eye he sees the house packed hears growing APPLAUSE
He makes a few grand stage gestures as hes mentally transported to
scenes of his former stage triumphs

WIPE -- A SWEEP OF HOUDINS ARM

across the audience reveals a THUNDEROUS AUDIENCE filling the opera
house

CLOSE-UP ON

Houdin drinking in the adulation metamorphizing before our eyes into a
larger-than-life star presence -

The APPLAUSE STOPS suddenly jarringly Houdin is alone with his
memories in the silent empty theatre

EXT - OPERA HOUSE DAY

The Cabbie half asleep jumps to his feet as Houdin trots back down
the opera house steps

CABBIE
Back to the hotel Monsieur

Houdin pulls out his pocketwatch and checks the time
HOUDIN
No hurry I dont suppose you know
where a Frenchman can get a drink
The Cabbie points up the block Houdin pays the boy two more francs
HOUDIN

Good boy Wait here I£ Im not back
in one hour come and get me

is
INT - GENTLEMANS CLUB DAY

Houdin steps into a surprisingly elegant dining and gaming salon
Arab waiters in white tunics and gloves attend the whims of RICH
CIVILIANS and SPOILED OFFICERS from the French Army and Navy
Beyond the main salon area are several gaming rooms

Houdin pauses at the untended Maitre D station He skims through
the guest register signs it Then he strolls over to the bar

BARTENDER
Your pleasure Monsieur

HOUDIN
Brandy The best you have

He looks around the room absorbing all the details The Bartender
hands him his drink

Sipping his brandy Houdin curiously saunters across the room
toward the gaming salons catching the notice of

an ARAB WAITER who angles himself to keep a surreptitious eye
on Houdin while clearing a table

INT - CARD SALON CONTINUOUS -

Houdin lingers in the doorway to observe a poker game among two
French Navy LIEUTENANTS and three French Army officers -- a MAJOR
and two CAPTAINS

The Major (MAJOR GUILLAUME) and one Captain (CAPTAIN MERLE) wear
distinctive RED SHOULDER BRAIDS Major Guillaume smokes a
cigarillo as he leans superciliously back in his chair

Houdins eyes widen ever so slightly as he strolls behind the
players glancing sidelong at their cards

HOUDINS POV -- MOVING

The two Navy Lieutenants hold incredibly good hands -- a full
house and four jacks respectively The Lieutenant with four
jacks slides a thick pile of bills into the por

LIEUTENANT
One hundred

The braidless Army Captain (CAPTAIN DUNOIS) matches the bet
Captain Merle counts out 200 francs then scowls at Houdins
nosiness But before Merle can hide his cards we see
HOUDINS POV

Captain Merle only holds a pitiful pair of fours

MERLE
One hundred And one hundred again

Meanwhile Major Guillaume regards Houdin suspiciously gripping
his cards to his chest as Houdin walks behind him The Lieutenant
with four jacks considers a moment then meets the bet

fCONT TATION

LIEUTENANT
Your bet And fifty more

As everyone else bets Captain Merle folds quietly

MAJOR
Call
All cards are laid out The Lieutenants four-of-a-kind the
other Lieutenants full house Captain Dunois three deuces and
lastly the Major‘s— igh

A whistle of admiration and groans from the others The Major
grins and rakes in the enormous pot

HOUDIN
Is this a closed game Or may anyone
play

GUILLAUME
Ill take your money if you have it
to lose -- Monsieur

Houdin pointedly ignores the question He pulls up a chair and
rops a hefty wad of cash on the table

Houdin boldly takes the deck While continuing to talk he
rapidly FLIPS THROUGH the cards one by one front and back

HOUDIN
I cant help but notice Major
Guillaume seems to be having the
lions share of luck today

GUILLAUME
(seemingly unruffled)
The cards have been kind to me
How is it you know my name

HOUDIN
Lets just say the spirits told me

His examination complete Houdin hands the deck across the table
to one of the Lieutenants

HOUDIN
Would you be so kind as to shuffle
these I wouldnt want to be accused
of cheating -- like your friend Major
Guillaume

Guillaume is instantly livid as is Merle The others are shocked
GUILLAUME
Sir -- I consented to your joining our
game I did not grant you permission
to disparage my honor

in

HOUDIN
Since there is no honor in cheating at
cards I have not disparaged yours in
any way Ive merely stated a fact (to
the others) Wouldnt you gentlemen like
to know how the Major is cheating you

OTHER PLAYERS
Yes Indeed Absolutely

Club patrons and staff begin to gather round Among them leaning
casually against the doorway is a Foreign Legion officer We
dont quite see his face but we see hes wearing one WHITE GLOVE

GUILLAUME
Bo you know who I am

HOUDIN
Should I care

MERLE
Major Guillaume is deputy adjutant to
‘the Marshal-Governor himself

HOUDIN
Would you do me the honor of dealing the
cards Lieutenant I dont even wish
to touch them Five apiece No draw

The Lieutenant deals out the cards

MERLE
He could have you jailed for your
insolence

HOUDIN

I doubt that I have diplomatic
protection from the Foreign Minister
himself You cant bully me like
you can these other fellows Major
One hand to prove whos telling the
truth Your antes gentlemen

Intimidated everyone antes

HOUDIN
Now for the betting I venture
(looking at the backs of the
Lieutenants’ cards) you have a
pair of fives and you have
nothing Id sit this one out
But you do as you please

The two Lieutenants eye other then quickly lay their cards face down
HOUDIN
Of course that mightve been a

fortuitous guess on my part
Captain Dunois Your bet sir

Dunois hesitates then takes the plunge

DUNOIS
Twenty francs

HOUDIN
A cautious gentleman Excellent
Captain Merle Care to put your
money on the table

But Merle refuses to cooperate

MERLE
Fold

HOUDIN
With two pairs queens and jacks
Now why would an honest player like
yourself fold with cards like that
Could it be you can read Captain
Dunois hand and see that he holds
three eights

Dunois glances again at his own cards
DUNOIS POV
A deuce a five and sure enough three eights

Ore Lieutenant makes a grab for Merles cards

LIEUTENANT
Let me see those

Merle angrily slaps his palm down to keep his cards from being
exposed

MERLE
I said fold

HOUDIN
Testy arent we That leaves Major
Guillaume Captain Dunois here and
myself

MERLE
How does he know everybodys name
Who let this man in here

HOUDIN
I raise two thousand francs

Shock among the spectators at the size of the bet

Dunois tosses down his cards face up for all to see Things are
suddenly too weird for him

DUNOIS
I think Im in the wrong game

The spectators crane and stretch to see if Dunois cards match Houdins

prediction Houdin leans back in his chair projecting total command

HOUDIN
So its the Major and myself (to
Guillaume) Are you willing to match
my bet Or are you as great a coward
as you are a cheat

Guillaumes eyes lock murderously on Houdin He forces himself to
check his cards again

GUILLAUMES POV
The seven of clubs and four kings

A sneer dances around the edges of Guillaumes mouth He pushes
over half his entire pile of winnings seeing Houdins bet --
then deliberately the rest of his winnings as well By now
everyone in the room is breathless

GUILLAUME
Is that brave enough for you

HOUDIN
Lets make it even more interesting

Houdin materializes out of thin air a 20-CARAT RUBY Gasps
throughout the room

Among the shocked spectators is the Arab Waiter who was watching
Houdin earlier He follows Houdins every move without even the
pretense of working

HOUDIN
From India The Maharajah of Amritsar
gave it to me on my 43rd birthday

Houdin tosses the ruby into the pot

HOUDIN
This ruby Major -- against your bet
your sword and your pistol You lay
your cards face down on the table and
dont touch them again until its time
to show your hand Do we have a wager

Guillaume hesitates

HOUDIN
What do you have to lose Since you
marked the deck you know perfectly
well which cards I hold Its not as
though youd be gambling

Houdin fans his hand around the table showing everyone but Merle
and Guillaume that his hand is garbage nothing not even a pair

Guillaumes eyes burn at Houdin He rechecks his own cards

GUILLAUMES POV
Same as before Four kings and the seven of clubs

Guillaume resentfully lays his cards face down on the table one
at a time

HOUDIN
Bravo So what do we have here

He reaches over and delicately spreads out Guillaumes cards tapping
each one just once with his middle finger

HOUDIN
King of hearts king of diamonds king
of spades and king and seven of clubs

GUILLAUME
(with menace)
I call

HOUDIN
First place your wager on the table

Guillaume angrily removes his saber and pistol dumps them all on
the table

GUILLAUME
For the last time Show your cards

Koudin dramatically lays down his hand FOUR KINGS and the seven

Enraged and disbelieving Guillaume turns over his cards -- He has
Youdints r e hand Everyone is flabbergasted
HOUDIN

It would appear the winning cards
prefer my company Still a bet is
abet Especially in front of all
these witnesses

GUILLAUME
You-- you cheated

HOUDIN
Did anyone here see me cheat

The spectators murmer ‘no Houdin rakes in his winnings

HOUDIN
There you have it

Guillaume seething pushes back his chair and stands Merle does
likewise

GUILLAUME
You will regret this Monsieur Whoever-
you-are

CONTTNITEN

HOUDIN
The dogs bark but the caravan passes on

Guillaume and Merle roughly shove their way out the door

The gallery immediately starts buzzing Spectators jostle forward
to congratulate Houdin shake his hand offer to buy him a drink

Houdin coolly hands off a generous share of the money to one of
the Navy Lieutenants

HOUDIN
For you and your friend who were rooked

Houdin works his way through the throng of admirers Paying no
special notice he plunks his empty brandy snifter on the tray of
the Arab Waiter the same waiter whos been watching him with
such keen interest

EXT - OPERA HOUSE STREET DAY

Houdin crosses the street from the bar clutching Guillaumes
weapons as souvenirs However-his taxi is nowhere to be seen
He calls up and down the street

HOUDIN
Taxi Taxi (no answer) Blast it

Now he must walk back to the hotel He starts down the street
But he doesnt get far

Major Guillaume Captain Merle and four other JUNIOR ARMY
OFFICERS -- also wearinc red shoulder braids -- step out from an
alley and block Houdins path Houdin not taking the threat
seriously tries to maneuver around them

HOUDIN
How melodramatic I thought we
settled this matter inside

Guillaumes men surround Houdin forcing him towards the alley

HOUDIN
Perhaps I didnt make myself clear
Iam a diplomatic representative of
the--

One of the Red Braids slams his fist into Houdins stomach knocking
all the air out of him

HOUDIN
(wheezing)
Republic

The Red Braids strongarm Houdin into the alley out of public view

EXT - ALLEY DAY

Two Red Braids pin Houdins arms while two others administer half a
dozen punches to his gut Guillaume steps forward and sadistically
grabs Houdins jaw pressing his skull against the wall

GUILLAUME
I dont know who you are but you have
made a fatal mistake No one shames
Henri Guillaume and lives to brag
about it (to Merle) Take his money
And the ruby

The Red Braids jam Houdin hard against the wall as Guillaume lets
go to rearm himself Merle robs Houdin as ordered

MERLE
You thought you were so clever

Merle himself hits Houdin a vicious punch to the kidneys then a
hard right cross to the jaw

HOUDIN
(in pain gasping for breath)
I stand corrected

Guillaume draws a dagger and twists the blade back and forth
before Houdins eyes relishing his victory

GUILLAUME
As far as anyone will know you were
just another rich gentleman who was
accosted by bandits unknown --
undoubtedly Arab lowlifes -- who robbed
you of your valuables and slit your
throat It happens all the time

VOICE (0S)
Not today Guillaume Let him go

All the Red Braids turn and look

ANGLE ON

A bare right hand poised to draw a sword
FOLLOW the sword up as its drawn TO REVEAL

Captain TREY DARCY of the Foreign Legion WHITE GLOVE on one hand
sword in the other He advances steadily down the alley

MERLE
Darcy

DARCY
(conversationally)
I can never decide which is more
repulsive Maggot-infested meat
vomited up by a one-eyed three-
legged dog with leprosyor an
officer in the French Army

GUILLAUME
Stay out of this Legionnaire This
isnt your fight

DARCY
I think the dog has just a slight edge
What do you think

Darcy advances to within a few feet of Guillaume The Red Braids
fearfully unhand Houdin who slumps to the ground

GUILLAUME
You completely misunderstand the
situation I merely meant to give
our friend here a scare

DARCY
to Houdin)
Did he scare you

HOUDIN
(gasping)
Well enough

DARCY
(to Guillaume)
Give the man back his valuables and
maybe I wont have to bloody my sword

Guillaume steps back Merle sullenly tosses the stolen money and
ruby back at Houdins feer

Darcy sheathes his sword He contemptuously bats Guillaume aside
in order to reach Houdin and help him to his feet

DARCY
You all right

Behind Darcy Guillaume angrily cocks his pistol and presses the
barrel to the back of Darcys skull

GUILLAUME
You know Darcy someone really should
teach you Legionnaires some manners

Darcy freezes but doesnt lose his composure or bravado
DARCY

I cant argue with that My mother

taught me the importance of etiquette
With lightning speed Darcy spins around in place and knocks away
Guillaume‘s gun arm The pistol DISCHARGES wildly shooting Merle
in the hip In the same move Darcy breaks Guillaumes nose and
decks him with a single smashing blow
Merle and Guillaume both fall screaming in agony

DARCY
Rule of etiquette number one Never
draw your gun unless you mean to use it

JUNIOR RED BRAID
(reacting to Merles wounding)
You filthy bastard

All the Red Braids draw swords and attack Darcy -- four to one

Darcy becomes a twisting whirlwind of slashing steel with his right
hand delivering punishing smashes with his left arm ducking and
dodging one lethal blow after another

The first Red Braid is down mangled Now the Second Red Braid
falls Guillaume struggles to his feet and rejoins the fight

Darcy suffers a few good blows but fights his way back His
uniform is ripped open Another sword gashes him in the arm--
But Darcy gives back tenfold what he gets

Darcy slashes down each remaining Red Braiduntil only Guillaume
is left

He hurls away his own sword disarms Guillaume with a bone-
breaking kick to the elbow and picks him up like a rag doll
throwing him against the wall

Darcy mercilessly pummels him at will over and over again pounding
Guillaumes face into a grotesque pulp Horrified Houdin grabs
his arm to stop the mauling

HOUDIN
Stop it Youll kill him Stop it

Darcy lands several more blows before responding to Houdins pleas

With a final groan Guillaume collapses in a bloody unconscious
heap

As his violent madness subsides Darcy looks around in bewilderment
as if wondering where his other foes went

Guillaume and his cohorts lie all over the alley battered moaning
in agony One Red Braid starts to rise thinks better of it
Panting hard Darcy bends over the unconscious Guillaume

DARCY

Rule of etiquette number two Never
cross a Legionnaire

EXT - OPERA HOUSE STREET DAY
Houdin still a bit wobbly emerges from the alley with Darcy
HOUDIN
Tell me when do you think I lost

control of the situation

DARCY
When you wandered into a tigers den
and expected it to purr

HOUDIN
Ill remember that (grateful handshake)
Jean-Pierre Robert-Houdin Of Paris
and Saint-Gervais At your service

DARCY
Trey Darcy of the Foreign Legion
At yours

HOUDIN

Without which Im fairly sure Id be
a dead man

DARCY
More than likely

Corporal Bartolote rides up leading a second horse He dismounts
at the sight of his bloodied captain and immediately unpacks a
whiskey bottle for Darcy

BARTOLOTE
With all due respect sir you look
like hell

DARCY
And you need to improve your timing
Corporal (to Houdin) Augustino
Bartolote The toughest soldier
youll ever want to meet in battle

HOUDIN
Coming from you thats commendation
indeed

BARTOLOTE

Any friend of the Captains

Bartolote extends a friendly bone-crusher handshake Houdin
flexes his throbbing hand after the Corporals ‘light squeeze
Darcy meanwhile pours whiskey over his gashed forearm

HOUDIN
Youve done this before

DARCY
Once or twice

HOUDIN

You saved my life I think I owe you
a drink

The two men are all spiffed up in formal wear -- white tie for
Koudin dress uniform for Darcy Colette is ravishing her hair
pinned high her neckline low

Theyre seated at an elegant dinner table having a wonderful
time Uniformed Arab waiters whisk away soup plates In the
adjoining ballroom the hotel orchestra plays Strauss waltzes

COLETTE
What then Captain

DARCY
He produced a ruby Out of thin air

COLETTE
Not from the Majarajah No
(rapping Houdins arm with her fan)
I cant believe you had the nerve --

HOUDIN
I was shameless I admit it

COLETTE
That ‘ruby is a paste imitation Horrible

DARCY
It was still most amazing Your
husband is quite a remarkable man
Madame Houdin

COLETTE
As are you Yet your life is devoted
to war and killing Why

HOUDIN
(Dont be rude)
Colette--

COLETTE
Im just curious Why would a man
with your breeding and education
choose a military career

DARCY
Perhaps it chose me -

Just then Colonel Gastinot arrives at the door thoroughly
discomposed at being late Darcys back is turned to Gastinot as
the Colonel in his haste bows to Colette

GASTINOT
(blathering)
Madame Houdin Monsieur Houdin My
deepest apologies The Marshal-
Governors office summoned me at the
last minute -- Good I see youve
already ordered dinner and-and

He stops short as he sees Darcy Hes not pleased at the sight

GASTINOT
Captain Darcy How very odd to find
you here in Algiers On leave Or
have you finally deserted

DARCY -
Good evening Colonel Shuffled any
good papers lately

GASTINOT
Uh Monsieur Houdin May I speak
with you privately

HOUDIN
(to the others)
Please excuse me

Houdin rises The hotel orchestra begins another inviting waltz
In the background we can see the ballroom filling up

DARCY
Perhaps youd permit me to ask your
lovely wife to dance

HOUDIN’
You may ask The lady has a mind of
her own

Gastinot drags Houdin away from the table

INT - HOTEL DORIENT LOBBY NIGHT

GASTINOT
What on earth are you doing associating
with Trey Darcy

HOUDIN
You disapprove

GASTINOT
Hes not fit company for a gentleman
And I would never let him come near

HOUDIN
Madame Houdin can handle herself
What is this about

INT - HOTEL DORIENT BALLROOM NIGHT

Darcy and Colette make a striking couple as they step onto the
Gance floor The instant she lays her gloved right hand into the
palm of his white glove she stops dancing and becomes flustered -

COLETTE
Your hand Its
DARCY
Unique
COLETTE
uh yes

FOLLOW THEM -- MOVING
Darcy takes Colette in his arms again They resume their waltz

DARCY
It was in the Crimea A Russian
artillery shell landed in our trench
I picked it up to throw it back

COLETTE
Im so sorry

DARCY
So am I I was left-handed

INT - HOTEL D‘ORIENT LOBBY NIGHT

GASTINOT
He should be out in the desert with
the other wild animals These
Legionnaires are nothing but criminals

HOUDIN
Then why is France depending on them
to hold off the Kabyle rebels

GASTINOT
The man has already corrupted your
thinking Im sorry but I cannot have
you associating with such riff-raff--

HOUDIN
Then my wife and I shall return to
Marseilles on the next ship No one
dictates to me--

GASTINOT
-You cant do that

EXT - VERANDA OUTSIDE BALLROOM NIGHT
The music and light from the ballroom scream outside to the veranda
where Darcy and Colette are alone together Darcy removes his white
glove for Colette
CLOSE-UP ON
the glove coming off revealing a WOODEN HAND Finely crafted of
polished teak the prosthesis is strapped firmly onto his forearm
above the wrist It even has articulated fingers and joints

Colette pulls off her own glove and strokes the wooden hand

gingerly -- a strangely sensual moment
COLETTE
Does it ever need repair
She was going to say ‘hurt and Darcy realizes this
DARCY

Occasionally Mostly it helps with
the simple things The reins of a
horse Or the important things
Dancing with a beautiful woman

He takes Colettes bare hand with his hand the real one the
first time theyve actually touched To her own surprise Colette
doesnt pull back She cant take her eyes from Darcys face

Emboldened Darcy leans in to kiss Colette softly on the lips

But now Colette forces herself to move She snaps her fan open
blocking Darcy a few inches from her lips -- though her eyes remain
fixed on his

DARCY
Ive offended you

COLETTE
Very little offends me Captain

DARCY
Dont tell me You love your husband

COLETTE
Unfashionably so

DARCY
Just now Gastinots telling him
youre in the company of a depraved
swinish beast not to be trusted

COLETTE
And is he right

DARCY
Almost But I can be trusted I
shall make no more advances I give
you my word

COLETTE
I dont object to your advances as
long as you dont mind my rejection

DARCY
At any rate I would have nothing to
offer you but grief I shall die
before Iam 40 Thats what
Legionnaires do We fight and we die

COLETTE
strangely moved)
Then you have chosen for yourself the
most tragic life possible Captain
And I count myself fortunate never to
i have fallen in love with you

Darcy abruptly steps back and gently kisses her hand farewell
DARCY
Please give my regards to your husband
I consider him the luckiest of men

COLETTE
Where are you going

INT - HOUDINS HOTEL SUITE NIGHT
Houdin is in bed watching Colette brush her hair

HOUDIN
And youre positive he said nothing

COLETTE

He had to hurry back to his post
How many times must I repeat it

HOUDIN
How strange Not even saying goodbye

COLETTE
Perhaps its for the best Hes gone
We shall not see him again

She looks at herself one last time in the mirror strangely
perturbed She sets down her brush and climbs into bed

Houdin shakes his head He reaches out to turn out the gas lamp
Blackness

HOUDIN
Very odd

compound and right up to the Main Building

They rein up before a distinguished Legion COLONEL standing on the

DARCY
Colonel Chabriére Captain Darcy and
Corporal Bartolote reporting for duty
as ordered

The Colonel returns the salute Behind Darcy a FRENCH ARMY rifle
platoon marches out from behind a building in a routine-looking drill

COLONEL

COLONEL
Captain Darcy you are under arrest

Surrender your weapons

Darcy is indignant but trapped by troops of the French Army The
front door of the building opens and

MAJOR GUILLAUME hobbles out and stands alongside the Colonel

EXT - FESTIVAL GROUNDS DAY

A bright lovely morning The Algerian autum festival is underway
The fairgrounds are studded with the colorful tents of Arab nobility

French gentlemen with their ladies mingle amiably with upper-class
Arab men sipping cool drinks chatting and laughing

Amid this striking inter-cultural harmony Gastinot walks Colette
towards the parade field

COLETTE
How is it Colonel that the Arabs can
live in peace with the French but the
Kabyles cannot

GASTINOT

- Madame you first must know the history
of this region The Kabyles have never
accepted conquest And now these
barbarians have themselves a new
religious leader what they call a
Marabout Zoras al Khatim

COLETTE
Ive heard the name What is he like

GASTINOT
Zoras Hes a pure work of the devil
Pagan rituals sorcery so black I
cant even describe it

EXT - PARADE GROUNDS DAY
Colette and Gastinot approach the parade field where a military
fantasia® -- an exhibition of Arab horsemanship -- is beginning
COLETTE

You dont actually think this Zoras
performs real magic do you

GASTINOT
I saw him once in the town square in
Constantine He bit off the head of a
live cobra (shuddering) I hope never
to see such things again

COLETTE
After my husbands performance
e everyone will understand these are
only clever tricks

GASTINOT
I know real magic when I see it

COLETTE
Do you

Colette stops waves her fan crisply a few times in front of
Gastinots nose Then POOF The fan DISAPPEARS into thin air

COLETTE
I think I can find my way from here
Thank you for the escort Colonel

Gastinot is left speechless
But Colettes trick has attracted someone elses attention a short

distance away A pair of ARABS dressed as servants catch each
others eyes
c
EXT - PARADE GROUNDS DAY 35

The equestrian fantasia is underway Two long flanks of crack Arab
riders charge at each other at full gallop Just before they meet
they raise their seven foot long rifles and FIRE overhead at exactly
the same moment The report is as if only one gun was fired

With uncanny precision the flanks of horsemen then pass through
each others ranks and wheel around for the next charge

Colette joins Houdin at the front rail His spirits seem low

HOUDIN
What kept you

COLETTE
Colonel Gastinot was blathering on about
some wicked sorcerer Supposedly Gods
gift to the Algerian rebellion

HOUDIN
Maybe he is

COLETTE
What prompted this

HOUDIN
Colette what are we doing here

COLETTE
Were watching a horse show A very
good one too

HOUDIN
This is sheer arrogance Sailing across
the sea to meddle in someone elses
national affairs Im not political

COLETTE
Darling youre being asked to put on a
show Thats all Considering how our
enemy takes pride in slaughtering women
and children I should think youd be
anxious to knock their witcheraft
peddling demi-gods off their pedestals

HOUDIN
But what if I cant

COLETTE
Ah now we get to it

HOUDIN
What if something goes wrong I havent
been before an audience for five years
What if Ive lost my touch

COLETTE
Youll probably die of embarrassment
Right there on the stage in front of
500 people Your heart will give out
(MORE)

COLETTE (cont)
Your rotting cadaver will be sent back
to France in disgrace Meanwhile
Ill get all your money marry someone
much younger and easier to get along
with Ill take several handsome
lovers on the side and settle down
in a gorgeous villa on a hillside in
Tuscany overlooking the sea Thats
what will happen if something goes
wrong Feel better dear

WOODRUFF

“magic equipment
Colette climbs down through an OPEN TRAP DOOR beneath center stage

Meanwhile huffing and puffing Colonel Gastinot heaves a heavy
wooden chest up onto the stage

HOUDIN
Right there will be fine

Gastinot leans against the stage for a second to catch his breath

GASTINOT
What more can I do for you Monsieur
Houdin

HOUDIN

Cant think of a thing Colonel
Thanks for your help

Gastinot climbs onstage and begins to nose around

GASTINOT
Youre sure

HOUDIN
Quite sure Colonel You must have
much more important things to do
Well see you at dinner

GASTINOT
Whats all this for

Gastinot wanders over toa large nest of apothecary jars of
powders and chemicals spread out on a table He picks up one
large bottle filled with white powder squints to read the label

GASTINOT
Its so dark in here What does that say

HOUDIN
Put that down Colonel Unless you have
a driving desire to blow up this theatre

Gastinot doesnt put the jar down Instead he uncaps the lid to
sniff it Houdin irritated plucks it away restraining an
impulse to slap Gastinots hand

GASTINOT
duly repentant)
I‘m sorry

(CONTINU™

HOUDIN
Colonel please Dont touch anything
else without asking

Gastinot wanders over to some electrical gizmos

GASTINOT
What about these What do they do

Colette climbs out of the trap door carrying an armful of crushed
velvet Houdin throws her a look but she gestures helplessly

HOUDIN
(sighs gives up)
-Would you like me to show you how a
trick is done

Gastinots eyes widen in delight This is too much to hope for

GASTINOT
You woulddo that Oh Monsieur
Houdin I would be so-so-so--

HOUDIN
Qne trick One And you must promise
not to reveal the secret

GASTINOT
I swear As an officer of the French
Army I will tell no one Not a soul

COLETTE
Show him the pistol illusion

HOUDIN
Excellent (to Gastinot) Youll like
this one

GASTINOT

The pistol illusion Whats that

Houdin unlocks a fancy wooden case Inside an antique dueling
pistol gunpowder wadding barrel rod and lead balls He hands
the pistol to Gastinot

HOUDIN
Colonel would you be so kind as to load
this weapon A charge of powder a lead
ball of your choosing and wadding

GASTINOT
I know how to do it

Gastinot loads the pistol stuffing the wadding down the barrel
with the metal rod

HOUDIN
May I see To make sure you did it
properly

4c

Houdin takes back and scrutinizes the weapon keeping it always in
Gastinots plain sight Colette moves back a few paces

GASTINOT
I told you I know how to load a
common pistol

Apparently satisfied Houdin hands the pistol back

HOUDIN
So you do Excellent Now would you
be so kind as to shoot my wife

GASTINOT
I beg your pardon

HOUDIN
She displeases me She rarely does
as shes told she argues incessantly
and shes a terrible cook I wish
you to shoot her dead

Gastinot thrusts the pistol back into Houdins hand
GASTINOT
I most certainly will not Thats not
even funny

HOUDIN
Very well I11 do the bloody deed

Without a moments hesitation Houdin aims the barrel directly at
Colettes heart and fires BLAM

GASTINOT
My god man What have you done

But Colettes just standing there unaffected by the bullet

COLETTE
sees Am I dead yet

Gastinot sinks down on a nearby chair his nerves shot to hell

GASTINOT

But I loaded that gun I know I put

in a real bullet
HOUDIN

So you did And had I fired-the gun

you loaded something like this would

have happened

Houdin aims the gun in his hand at a huge goblet clear across the
stage He fires BLAM

The goblet SHATTERS

Gastinot almost jumps out cf his skin Colette glides over and
lays a calming hand on his shoulder

COLETTE
Its all right Colonel Its just a
trick
Houdin sets down two identical pistols in Gastinots lap
GASTINOT
Two guns But I watched you the
entire time I would have seen if
you made a switch
HOUDIN
Would you now And would you also have
noticed if all this time there was a
live rabbit crawling down your back

Houdin reaches down inside the back of Gastinots coat collar and
-- impossibly -- pulls out a huge full-grown hare

Poor Gastinots head is swimming Houdin and Colette exchange
mischievous grins

Yet scmehev the Houdins personal belongings -- clothing papers
toilecries -- all are pristine and clean absolutely untouched

Frantic heedless of damage to her gown Colette wades through the
mass of still smoking embers and throws open her jewelry case on
top of the blackened dresser Her jewelrys intact unharmed

COLETTE
Thank God (looking around) What in
heavens name--

Houdin more fascinated than upset surveys the damage

HOUDIN
Amazing Absolutely amazing (to
the Concierge) Did the fire spread
to any other rooms

CONCIERGE
No monsieur Only this room One of
the maids smelled the smoke But -
there was no fire to put out You see
the room exactly as we found it

Houdin fingers a shredded remnant of burnt curtain lace

HOUDIN
A chemical burn of some sort I
doubt the flames lasted more than a
few seconds

The handle to the charred armoire falls off as Colette opens it
Nothing inside is damaged Colette smells the clean fabric of
various garments in wonder

COLETTE
Not a thread singed (looking around)
None of our belongings were damaged
Or even touched How

CONCIERGE
I cannot explain it Madame

HOUDIN

Fire is the most dangerous and
unpredictable of the elements
Whoever did this wanted to show me
he can control the uncontrollable

Houdin nods in agreement The exchange is lost on the Concierge

Colette shoots Houdin a critical look turns her charm on Randon

COLETTE
Please excuse my husband Your
Excellency The main reason he came
here this late at night was to say how
deeply he regrets any embarrassment he
caused you and to appeal to your
powers of clemency

HOUDIN
(under Colettes glare)
I did not come to Algiers to get an
innocent man thrown in a hotbox to
die Your Excellency I ask you

He takes a breath Groveling like this is truly tough for him
HOUDIN (cont)
I plead with you to show mercy on
Captain Darcy for the sake of justice

Randon is lapping this up He takes his sweet time responding

RANDON
Thank you Monsieur Houdin Im very
moved by what youve said

COLETTE
So youll grant our request

RANDON
No Its a point of honor I
cannot allow the hordes I govern to
think its open season on government
officials It might become fashionable
But I do appreciate your abasing
your dignity to come here and beg
Can you roll over and bark as well

Colette drops the sweet little lady act and explodes

COLETTE
How dare you play stupid political
games when a mans life is in danger

HOUDIN
Colette--

COLETTE

If it werent for the Foreign Legion
you wouldnt be the Marshal-Governor
of anything The barbarians would
ride into Algiers and roast you for
dinner over an open fire Lord knows
they wouldnt have to baste you you
big fat porculent--

HOUDIN
Colerte

RANDON

No no no nono Let her talk You
both have diplomatic immunity And as
long as were trading insults let

me say that Colonel Gastinot may think
you walk on water but I regard your
coming to Algiers as a complete waste
of time Tell me do you really think
your ‘magic show will scare these
savages out of their war of rebellion

HOUDIN
You honestly believe my being here
is pointless

RANDON
Im quite convinced of it

HOUDIN
Then let your disbelief be your bond

RANDON
How do you mean

HOUDIN
Ill make you a wager If my
performance produces no good political
results you can send me packing on the
next ship Vilify me in the newspapers
gloat all you want But if I succeed
you give me your word of honor to
release Captain Darcy immediately

Randon ponders the offer looking for the loophole

RANDON
And youll let me judge whether
youve succeeded or failed

HOUDIN
I will

RANDON
(derisively)
Then you are not as clever as you
advertise yourself to be I accept
your challenge Monsieur And I
look forward to seeing you off on
the next garbage scow

EXT - RANDONS MANSION NIGHT

Houdin and Colette climb into their waiting carriage and collapse

INT - OPERA HOUSE STAGE NIGHT

Colette peeks through the curtain sizing up the audience In the
background behind her Houdin is making last minute preparations

COLETTES POV THROUGH CURTAIN CRACK

The house is filling up fast Arab Chieftains and French VIPs
have choice seats down front and in the boxes The Marabouts are
in the very first two rows

COLETTE
Oh my You wont believe whats
sitting down front Those must be
the Berber chieftains

HOUDIN (0S)
How do they look

COLETTE
Hungry For your skin

Up in the Royal Box Marshal Randon and his matronly wife squash
into their seats Madame Randon is tackily bejeweled and her satin
gown is hideous with an overabundance of furbelows and flourishes
COLETTE
Theres the Marshal-Governor and his
wife Someone should teach her how
to dress

HOUDIN (0S)
How does he look

COLETTES POV

Randon looks overly pompous in a dress white field-marshals uniform
with more medals ribbons and braids than Napoleon himself

COLETTE
He could be his own parade

HOUDIN
How do I look

Colette drops the curtain and turms to Houdin

COLETTE
Perfect

COLETTES POV

of the Robert-Houdin of legend a man weve barely glimpsed 50
far Any trace of nerves is gone In white tie and tails Houdin
exudes power and absolute confidence

Colette kisses Houdin on the lips proudly

INT - OPERA HOUSE NIGHT

In front of the audience an Arab Stageboy lights the last gas
footlight The audience quiets

The curtain rises A bare stage except for two sawhorses set
side by side To a smattering of polite APPLAUSE Houdin steps
onstage carrying a thin leather PORTFOLIO He bows and begins his
spiel relaxed and utterly in command

HOUDIN
Ladies gentlemen Marshal-Governor
Randon Madame Randon Honored guests
Thank you for your gracious welcome
When I was invited here from France I
had very little time to pack my personal
belongings Since I was in a hurry
I grabbed this my magical portfolio
knowing everything I could possibly use
on my journey would fit inside it

He tosses the portfolio in the air and catches it He sets it
down on the sawhorses opens it and peeks in

HOUDIN
Naturally I couldnt leave without
my pet birds

He takes out an impossibly large CAGE containing FOUR LIVE DOVES
A few minor oohs and ahs

HOUDIN
Then I thought what if Im lost at
night in the Sahara with nothing to read

Rummaging he pulls out THICK BOOK after THICK BOOK chucking them
carelessly over his shoulder -- THUD-THUD-THUD-THUD-THUD-THUD-THUD
-- until they form an absurdly huge pile The audience titters

HOUDIN
Of course one needs light to read by

The first real gasp of awe from the audience as Houdin pulls out a
brass CANDELABRA on a SIX FOOT STAND with 10 FULLY LIT CANDLES
The audience is flabbergasted Scattered applause

HOUDIN
And one can always use a little music
to lift the spirit when traveling
He pulls out a bulky FRENCH HORN and blasts a few sour notes

Houdin again closes the portfolio and twirls it in the air Light
as a feather He places it back down on the sawhorses

HOUDIN
Then in case of marauders --

Straining a bit Houdin pulls out two 40-POUND CANNONBALLS They
THUMP to the floor and roll off the end of the stage toward the
Marabouts who are already suspicious and frightened

HOUDIN
And of course one should never cross
the desert without a knowledgeable
trail guide

Houdin reaches in his magical portfolio one last time and lifts
out a CHIMPANZEE It gives Houdin a kiss on the cheek The
audience bursts into HUGE APPLAUSE

FLIP WIPE TO

A massively-built MARABOUT stands before Houdin dripping with
contempt His Berber accent is very strong

HOUDIN
So you are the strongest of your people

MARABOUT
IT am stronger than you

HOUDIN
No longer By my magic I will take
away your strength

MARABOUT
You have no power over me

HOUDIN
No Then I challenge you to lift
this little box

Houdin sets a small iron box on the stage floor The Marabout
snatches it and waves it overhead laughing His fellow Marabouts
hoot derisively Houdin grabs back the box

HOUDIN
Wait I am not finished By the Powers
of Mystery I command all your strength
to leave you You are weaker than the
weakest woman A tiny baby has more
strength than you Now lift the box
The Marabout tries again -- but the box wont budge
DISSOLVE THROUGH THE STAGE TRAP DOOR

to Colette who operates a switch connected by cables to a two
foot round ELECTROMAGNET mounted to the underside of the stage

HOUDIN (0S)
Perhaps you are not trying hard
enough Let me show you
Colette flips the switch gff
ONSTAGE

Houdin reaches down and lifts the box ever so easily He waves it
around spins it on his finger The Marabout fumes

MARABOUT
Let me try again

BENEATH THE STAGE

Colette flips the switch back on SPARKS crackle

ONSTAGE

The poor Marabout strains for all hes worth Sweat pours from
his forehead but the box wont move He pulls and claws at the
box savagely slipping and falling even crawling around on the
floor to wrest it free All to no avail Total humiliation

The French and Arabs applaud and laugh heartily

But the Berber Marabouts arent laughing Two of them lean
together to WHISPER frenziedly not taking their eyes off Houdin

FLIP WIPE To

A SURLY MARABOUT desirous of killing a Frenchman stands center
stage and aims an antique PISTOL point blank at Houdins heart

An APPLE sits on a table behind the Surly Marabout Houdin faces
his would-be executioner without fear

The Surly Marabout pulls the trigger As the pistol FIRES Houdin
Simultaneously points to the apple One side of the apple EXPLODES

Houdin walks back picks up the apple slices it open
CLOSE-UP ON

the apple as Houdin extracts a LEAD BALL and holds it up for all to
see The Marabout backs off afraid

Thunderous APPLAUSE and CHEERS
FLIP WIPE TO

Our final trick Houdin welcomes a MOORISH CHIEFTAIN onstage
His rich robes and headdress bespeak great wealth and rank

Gastinot hamming shamelessly to his friends helps Houdin lay a
wide wooden plank across the sawhorses used earlier The two
Frenchmen guide the Chieftain up onto the plank

Houdin brings over a four foot high PAPIER-MACHE CONE
‘ONE CONTINUOUS SHOT

As instructed the Moorish Chieftain squats down on the plank
Houdin places the cone over him

Houdin and Gastinot each grab one end of the plank and lift
Hobbling under the weight they carry the plank and cone downstage
to the footlights and

SLOW-MOTION

they HEAVE the plank towards the audience The Cone flies out
toward the Marabouts REVEALING

The plank is bare The Moor has vanished into thin air
STILL SLOW-MOTION

‘Houdin and Gastinot let the plank drop heavily to the hardwood
floor The SLOWED CRASH SOUND echoes surreally

BACK TO REAL TIME

Amazed silence Then a Marabout in the audience leaps to his feet
and screams

MARABOUT
Shaitan Shaitan

More horrified Berbers pick up the same cry Within seconds all
the Berber Marabouts and most of the Arabs panic out of their seats
Pointing accusingly at Houdin and caterwauling they scramble over
each other to escape the devil onstage

of the ‘vanished Chieftain standing at the front of the steps
looking around dazed (How did I get here)

As the mob crowds around him all asking questions at once the
Moor simply shakes his head -- he has no answers to offer

The two Whispering Marabouts still suspicious stand back from

the throng They confer then one slips off down the street

INT - OPERA HOUSE NIGHT

Houdin stands alone onstage facing his decimated audience A
smattering of nervous APPLAUSE begins then swells into a thundering
standing ovation with shouts of ‘Bravo Bravo

But Houdin doesnt even acknowledge the adulation of his audience
He just folds his arms across his chest and stares defiantly up at
Randon in the royal box (Well)

—e

Even Madame Randon is on her feet applauding But Randon just stares
back at Houdin not budging from his chair not moving a muscle

Then finally Randon nods slowly in agreement The magician has
proved his boast

Houdin half-bows in acknowledgement then turns back to accept the
cheers of his adoring audience

Houdin bows and accepts the gifts with a few words in Arabic

INT - COURTYARD PORTICO RANDONS MANSION DAY

Houdins weary but remains gracious to the very end of a tedious
receiving line Randon ever the gushing politician basks in
Houdin’s reflected glory all smiles and small talk as the lavishly
robed Arab Chieftains file by 7

As the very last VIP approaches Randons political grin broadens
He steps forward to introduce a handsome young Sheik

RANDON
Houdin my good friend May I
introduce Sheik Rachid Mohammed al-
Bakhar The son of the Bash-Aga of
the DJendel Bou-Allem

HOUDIN
I am honored

” RACHID
I bring blessings from my father He
has heard of the many wondrous things
you have done

RANDON
Many consider Bou-Allem to be the
single most powerful Arab in North
Africa

HOUDIN
(genuinely intrigued)
Is that so

RACHID
Marshal Randon exaggerates It is true
my father has great wealth but whatever
power he has proceeds from his wisdom
which is respected by rich and poor alike

RANDON
Sheik Rachid here has a proposition
Id like you to consider

INT - RANDONS OFFICE DAY

Boudin and Rachid converse while Randon hovers ready to goose the
discussion along Gastinot stands apart with Colette

RACHID
Thus my father could discern with his
own eyes the power of French magic

HOUDIN
As Ive taken pains to explain to the
other chieftains my magic is no more
than human cleverness Neither I nor
the Kabyles are gods Can Bou-Allem he
made to understand this point

RACHID
My father seeks only the truth

HOUDIN
Do I conclude from your invitation there
will be Kabyle sorcerers present as well

RACHID
Only one The great marabout Zoras
al Khatim

A conversation stopper Houdin glances over Rachids head at
Colette Alarmed she shakes her head ever so slightly in warning

HOUDIN
And just where is this winter palace
of Bou-Allem

RACHID
At Tiffelfel

GASTINOT
A charming spot Just over the Aures
Mountains Along a lovely river
Date palms olive groves clean desert
air sweeping up off the Sahara It
will be like going on holiday

ROUDIN
Im sure its bliss itself But if I
studied my maps correctly wouldnt we
have to pass through Berber territory

He crosses to the wall to examine a huge framed map of Algeria

RANDON

(laughing it off)
I assure you theres not the
Slightest danger Sheik al-Bakhar
and five of his cousins will ride
with you to guarantee safe conduct
No rebels would dare attack Arab
nobility of their rank

GASTINOT

Naturally a small Legion detachment
will be provided as escort A
symbolic presence really

HOUDIN
If theres no danger why a military
escort at all And why the Legion
rather than the French Army

GASTINOT
Um yes this is you see this sort of
task really is more the Legions domain
We wouldnt want to infringe on their
mission Protocol and all that

None of this fools Houdin

HOUDIN
Ill go to Tiffelfel On one condition
RANDON ©
Which is
HOUDIN
(to Rachid)
No disrespect to you and your cousins
but -- (to Randon) I want a full

company of Legion cavalry with me

RANDON
Jean-Pierre my friend You really
are making too much of this This is
a quiet diplomatic peace mission I
assure you--

HOUDIN
I dont want your assurances I want
adequate military protection or else
I dont go And J choose the
commanding officer

Randon squirms Houdin unflinchingly waits for his answer

Darcy rides up to the hotel by himself pushing his way through
the beggars and cabbies to dismount Suddenly Houdin bursts out
of the hotel The two men embrace joyfully

EXT - ARAB COFFEE HOUSE DAY

Houdin and Darcy are the only Europeans in the dark men-only
establishment They confer over friendly cups of steaming coffee
Houdin is revitalized brimming with zeal for his mission

DARCY
You realize if you fail to impress
Bou-Allem you only make Zoras
stronger than he already is

HOUDIN
I know what I can do I doubted
myself before but no longer This
is why I came to North Africa It
finally makes sense to me

DARCY
At the very least you shouldnt drag
Madame Houdin along Its very
foolish to bring her

HOUDIN
She insists Besides if you were
married to her youd do foolish
things too

Darcy knows this is true Uncomfortable he nods and sips his coffee

EXT - OPERA HOUSE CARRIAGE YARD DAY

Behind the opera house Arab SERVANTS load Houdins equipment into
a wagon under Houdins supervision Theres no way all the crates -

and boxes are going to fit Darcy leans against a post offering
free advice

DARCY
You know Randons just using you to
curry favor with Bou-Allem If
something goes wrong hell be the
first to disown any part in this

HOUDIN
The mans a snake I know (to the
servants loading the wagon) Wait
That one stays -- take it off

The servants comply
DARCY
As for the barbarians they define
treachery and deceit Well probably
fight off an ambush at every turn

HOUDIN
If youd rather stay home

DARCY
(Are you kidding)
This is what I live for

Six royal Arab ESCORTS including Rachid ride Camels and Horses
at the front of the wagon The Legion Calvary brings up the rear

Bartolote drives the wagon Next to him Colette shades herself
with a parasol

Houdin and Darcy ride alongside the wagon Darcys sharp eyes
constantly scour the terrain for signs of danger

HOUDIN
Who could exist out here in this
Godforsaken wilderness

DARCY
Youd be surprised See those caves
(pointing) This whole area was once
a killing ground for the hashashin
They regularly preyed on travelers
who thought as you

COLETTE
The who

DARCY
An order of fanatics devoted to the
art of political murder Thats
where our word ‘assassin comes from
Assassin - hashashim

- ROUDIN
Shouldnt we be moving a bit faster then

COLETTE
Youre not afraid are you husband
(looking at Darcy) Im not afraid

DARCY
I wouldnt worry The Assassins died
out four centuries ago (gesturing)
Their ancient fortress is about a
day’s journey east of here Built
into the side of a mountain The
Kabyles wont even go near it

HOUDIN
Why not
DARCY
Ghosts
Houdin snorts in scorn
COLETTE
Id like to see it Would you take
me there
DARCY

Do you believe in ghosts

COLETTE
I will if you want me to

Houdin raises an eyebrow at Colettes flirting Having gotten her
husbands attention Colette smiles with a trace of smugness

EXT - HIGH DESERT SUNSET

Tired and sweaty the party is stopped at a stone well Several
soldiers haul up goatskins of water for the horses

Darcy brings a ladle of water over to Colette alone in the wagon

COLETTE
Youre so thoughtful Captain Trey
Thank you

She drinks deeply Darcy cant take his eyes off her Their hands
touch as she hands back the ladle -- and theyre both aware of it

COLETTE
(flirtatiously)
You must have broken some hearts
when you left America

DARCY
Not a one I never learned how

COLETTE
Thats hard to believe

She stands in the wagon holds out her hand to be helped down
Instead Darcy takes her firmly by the waist and lifts her down
inches in front of him She doesnt step away

COLETTE
‘Youve never told me why you joined
the Legion

DARCY
Youre right I never did

He strides away carrying the ladle back to the soldiers

COLETTE
(taking it as an affront)
Well

EXT HIGH DESERT CAMPSITE NIGHT

The caravan has formed camp in the high desert country Most of the
party has bedded down A few Legionnaires guard the camp perimeter

Colette brings a plate of stew to Bartolote who sits by a fire
cleaning his pistol

COLETTE
Would you care to finish mine
Corporal Ive had all I can eat

Bartolote hesitates then takes the plate and starts wolfing the
food down Colette perches next to hin leaning on a rock

COLETTE
Im curious What made Captain Darcy
enlist in the Legion

BARTOLOTE
(mouth full)
I have no idea

COLETTE
Well what made you join

BARTOLOTE
The desire not to answer questions

COLETTE
One hears such intriguing even
romantic stories about men who run
away and join the Legion Affairs of

love gone wrong broken hearts left
behind painful memories
BARTOLOTE

If you must know I killed a man
Colette is struck speechless It takes her a second to recover
COLETTE
YouThis- this man you killed Was he
a bad man He must have deserved it

Bartolote plunks his fork down He looks hard at Colette as he
punishes her with the facts

BARTOLOTE
It was a priest (pausing to let
the shock register) In Seville He
caught me robbing his church and 1
killed him I was sentenced to the
gallows but I escaped Thats when
I joined the Legion

Colettes fascination has turned to revulsion as she struggles to
Square her experience with Bartolote with this sordid picture

BARTOLOTE
Not so romantic is it
COLETTE
But you dont seem to be the type of
man to I mean who would
BARTOLOTE

Theres a bit of killer in all of us
I was blind drunk one night and it
came out in me

COLETTE
There you are You werent yourself
when you committed the crime

BARTOLOTE
I knew what I was doing I just
didnt have the courage to face my
punishment Thats the way it is with
all of us And dont think Captain
Darcy over there is any different

COLETTE
Hes not a murderer

BARTOLOTE
How do you know He could be

Colette doesnt know In doubt she gazes across the camp at Darcy
BARTOLOTE
Whatever hes done it doesnt matter
Because thats what the Legion is
Home when nobody else on earth will
take you

Bartolotes eyes deaden as he stares into the campfire We sense
torturous images impossible to erase tumbling through his mind

SLOW ZOOM TO
Bartolote through the smoke and flickering of the fire

BARTOLOTE

You start over New name no questions
asked The Legion -- they dont care
what youve done Alls they demand
is that you obey orders and fight

If youre lucky you get something
decent to fight for But even so we
dont much care one way or the other
And if you do take a bullet in the gut
or in the chest you dont complain
because you knew all along you had it
coming So you keep fighting and hope
another bullet comes along to finish
the job sos you dont suffer long

HOLD ON

A spectacular view down 2000 feet to the end of a river canyon
opening out to the desert beyond A tiny farming village lies
alongside a winding river Date palms and orange groves stop

abruptly at the edge of the barren sand dunes of the Sahara

Dominating the settlement is a magnificent 100-room palace straight
out of an Arabian fairy tale replete with domes and minarets

BOU-ALLEM leads Houdin Colette and Darcy through his opulent
palace in and out of courtyards and rooms all of which drip with
extravagance and luxury with myriads of servants everywhere

Bou-Allem 60ish is strong and handsome -- a devout lion of Islam
who obviously enjoys his wealth but also embodies graciousness
wisdom and honor

CONSTANTLY MOVING

BOU-ALLEM
Tell me my friend What do you think
of Arab culture Do you consider us
uncivilized savages

6C

HOUDIN
I hardly think the culture that invented
the astrolabe and the geomantic
calculator qualifies as uncivilized

BOU-ALLEM

(pleased)
You do not speak like ether Europeans
What else do you admire about us

HOUDIN
Simple things I know the numbers 1
write are Arabic numbers The star
charts which take ships across great
oceans are Arabic star charts I know
that in the year of my Lord 825 an
Arab wrote the first book on algebra
for the common man while the French
aristocracy was trying to keep the
peasants from learning how to read
I respect your elevation of knowledge
over superstition design over chaos
In short Your Eminence I admire so
much of your culture that for the
betterment of my countrymen I hope to
take some home with me when I depart

BOU-ALLEM
You have studied our ways That is
good I too respect many things the
Europeans have brought to our land
It would be a shame if we could not
continue to live together in peace

Bou-Allem leads them up an open stairway to an equally opulent
guest wing Their voices echo off the exquisite tilework of the
palace walls

STILL MOVING

HONDIN
I quite agree Now it is my turn
to ask you a question Bou-Allem
I understand my opponent Zoras al
Khatim claims to speak for God
Do you believe this to be true

BOU-ALLEM
answering with care)
Truth is hard to discern I do not
want to believe what he says but I
cannot argue with divine miracles

HOUDIN
Neither can I But if I show you the
falseness of his miracles will you
accept the falseness of his character

BOU-ALLEM
As aman of honor yes But I must
warn you If you do not prevail and
should Zoras persuade me you are indeed
the enemy of Allah it will be my duty
to kill you Please do not take it
personally

Houdin swallows his unease Nothing like a polite death threat at
the top of the stairs Bou-Allem leads them around a final corner

pillows before the remains of an elaborate feast

Bartolote and the other Legionnaires sit in spots of lesser honor
but they can still see enough to make them drool

Colettes so embarrassed at the dancers skimpy silk-and-sequins

dont seem to have the same problem

HOUDIN
She is absolutely lovely Bou-Allem

BOU-ALLEM
She is too thin One would think 1
did not feed her

COLETTE

Your Eminence May I ask a question
BOUALLEM

Of course

Why do you require your women to veil
their faces

BOU-ALLEM

I have 63 sons and 147 grandsons
COLETTE

And how many daughters and grand-

daughters
Bou-Allem has never been asked this question before

BOU-ALLEM
I have no idea

COLETTE

count your female children

HOUDIN
Colette--

COLETTE
Do you even know how many wives
you have

BOU-ALLEM
Thirty-five No-- Thirty-six

HOUDIN
Please forgive my wife She talks
more than she should

BOU-ALLEM
True But I like her spirit In
fact my friend I will offer you a
trade Your wife for any two of my
concubines

COLETTE

Dont entertain even the thought
BOU-ALLEM
And I will throw in three black
racing camels

Its a very generous offer

HOUDIN
Three black camels you say

COLETTE
(to both men)
This is not funny

HOUDIN
Let me think it over

BOU-ALLEM
Dont think too long my friend
Very few women are worth three black
camels Very few are even worth two

COLETTE

The second we get home
Just then a Servant enters and whispers in Bou-Allems ear
Bou-Allem claps his hands twice The dancers stop at once bow
to their master and run off The music continues softer
BOU-ALLEM
Zoras al Khatims holy disciples
have arrived

HOUDIN
Only his disciples

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Nine KABYLE DERVISHES dancing wildly around the fire chanting and
wailing to madly pounding DRUMS

Houdin reclines next to Bou-Allem with Colette and Darcy just
behind them Bou-Allems entire household is there watching

Suddenly the drums stop The Dervishes all bow low toward the
fire All eyes are on the flames

LOOKING INTO THE FIRE

First nothing Then a vague outline appears at the bottom A
HOODED SHADOW rises to man height The Shadow walks forward

Colettes eyes widen in fear She glances at Houdin

Houdin is impassive His eyes narrow as he studies the apparition
moving inside the flames

HOUDINS POV

as ZORAS AL KHATIM steps out of the bonfire his eyes closed as
if ina trance He swivels slowly to face Bou-Allem then his
eyes pop open wide as if hes returning to the living Zoras
kneels loyally before Bou-Allem

ZORAS
(in Arabic)
Your Eminence I have come

Bou-Allem gestures Zoras to rise then leads him to Houdin Zoras
addresses Houdin respectfully in Arabic Bou-Allen translates

BOU-ALLEM
The great marabout Zoras al Khatim is
honored to meet the celebrated French
marabout Robert-Houdin He looks forward
to teaching you the power of Allah

HOUDIN
Please ask him how he wishes to be
addressed that I may pay him the
proper respect

Bou-Allem starts to translate Zoras lifts his hand to interrupt

ZORAS
You may call me simply Zoras It
means The Learned One

Greatly startled Bou-Allem mutters fearfully to himself in Arabic

HOUDIN
I had been told on good authority you
did not speak any European tongue

ZORAS
It is true I did not until this very
moment when my God revealed to me by a
powerful miracle your entire language
in all its dimension Is it not an
amazement

HOUDIN
Amazement seems too light a word

ANGLE BEHIND HOUDIN

to Colette and Darcy

COLETTE
How about the word ‘lie

DARCY
Shhhh

ZORAS

Would it not be a fair test to now ask
weur Christian god to reveal to you
the Berber language in a‘similar
manner This way we shall know whose
God is the more powerful

HOUDIN
If the Almighty wishes me to speak
Berber I presume Hell put me in touch
with a good language teacher

ZORAS
As I expected He runs from my
challenge

BOU-ALLEM

Come my new friend Robert-Houdin It
is time for Zoras and his disciples to
astound you with their wonders Then
you must prove to me if these are not
indeed genuine signs and miracles
HOUDIN

Iocant wait

EXT - PALACE COURTYARD NIGHT

ANGLE PAST

sizzling coals red-hot and glowingto a pair of BARE FEET stepping
forward onto the coals We hear the HISS as the flesh hits the embers

WIDEN TO REVEAL
Zoras walking slowly across the bed of coals
DISSOLVE TO

Zoras pulls a red-hot iron from the coals He ceremoniously places
it on his tongue then runs it down the front of his body

Houdin studiously takes in every detail
DISSOLVE TO

Zoras shows Bou-Allem a screened wooden box He opens it The box
is full of live SCORPIONS

Zoras reaches into the bex and pulls out a handful of the poisonous
creatures Slowly he places the scorpions in his mouth

Several of Bou-Allems wives and concubines flee Colette looks
away sick Darcy riveted with disgust wrenches his eyes away

COLETTE

(shaky)
I thought I was prepared for anything
What is he

DARCY

(trying to convince himself)
Houdin says hes just a man

Suddenly Colette and Darcy look down and realize theyre holding
hands squeezing tightly in fact Embarrassed they let go
Colette quickly glances at Houdin He hasnt noticed

Smugly sure hes already won Zoras begins his grisly finale He
ritualistically draws a sword

One of his disciples kneels head to the floor and presents his
arms Zoras slashes at the mans arm with the blade leaving
several bloody gashes

Zoras steps hautily before Bou-Allem His eyes roll upward into the
whites

as he slowly STABS the sword from right to left through his
stomach Blood drips from both the entry and exit wounds

Darcy cant look anymore Even Houdin winces a bit

Zoras exhibits neither pain nor concern Just as slowly he
withdraws the sword and proudly waves the blade high in the air

Colettes face is buried in her hands She leans forward to Houdin

COLETTE
Am I missing anything Please say yes

HOUDIN
Its over Its my turn

BOU-ALLEM
My friend you must admit these are
truly signs of great wonder

HOUDIN
They are tricks Every one of them

BOU-ALLEM
Tricks The sword the scorpions --
these are tricks

HOUDIN
Bring me the scorpions

Bou-Allem snaps his fingers A Servant fetches Zorass box

Houdin rolls up his right sleeve He opens the box lid and sticks
his right hand inside He lifts out several scorpions lets them
run over his bare arm Bou-Allem shudders

Houdin shakes the scorpions back into the box then rummages in a
small leather pouch He lifts out a small glass box containing a
single live scorpion

HOUDIN
This is a real scorpion One whose
poison sac has not been surgically
removed

Houdin opens the lid dumps his scorpion into Zorass collection

HOUDIN
Zoras I defy you to put your hand in
the box once more Show me a miracle

Zoras doesnt move In Arabic Bou-Allem questions the Marabouts
hesitation Zoras consults two disciples then quickly announces

ZORAS
This scorpion has not been blessed by
Allah To touch it would defile me

HOUDIN
How convenient

BOU-ALLEM
What about walking through the fire
On the hot coals

ZORAS
Can you do the same

HOUDIN
Lets find out Bring me the hottest
coal in the fire

Zoras barks out an order in Berber A Disciple uses tongs to
pluck out a fiery coal and bring it to Houdin

Houdin fearlessly takes the smoking coal between his fingers He
rolls it around in his palm without harm Bou-Allem is confused

HOUDIN
There is no magic here It is all
fakery A lie As is Zorass claim
to be a holy man

BOU-ALLEM
Strong words Then show me how this
fakery is done

HOUDIN
As you wish Will you permit my wife to
touch her fingers to your royal hands

BOU-ALLEM
I have no objections

Colette who has been pouring out lotion from a glass bottle
scoots forward and rubs her hands all over Bou-Allems

HOUDIN
A simple paste of common ingredients
Invisible on the skin it forms a
shield that protects against heat

Houdin picks up the hot coal

HOUDIN
Hold out your hand This will not
hurt you

Bou-Allem reluctantly holds out a clenched fist

BOU-ALLEM
You realize what happens if I am burned

HOUDIN
The offer of two concubines and three
black camels is off Trust me Open
your fist

Colette gently strokes Bou-Allems fist to coax it open Bou-Allem
exinges in anticipation of pain as Houdin drops the coal into his
hand But amazingly

BOU-ALLEM
I feel nothing Perhaps the coal is
no longer hot

HOUDIN
One way to test that

Houdin wads up a piece of paper and places it on top of the coal in
Bou-Allems hand The paper bursts into a harmless ball of flame

BOU-ALLEM
You speak the truth

HOUDIN
Congratulations Your Eminence on
your promotion to the rank of marabout
Bou-Allem delights in his new toy like a child bouncing the burning
paper from hand to hand He stands up and shows off to all his
attending servants who applaud him
Zoras can stand this no longer

ZORAS
He deceives you IZ prayed that Your
Eminence would not be harmed by the
fire The Frenchman claims the glory
for mz magic Let him do something
of himself

Houdin abruptly stands His commanding voice echoes off the walls

HOUDIN
Enough of your lies Zoras You want
Magic you say Trye magic

Houdin thrusts up both arms The air above the courtyard EXPLODES
with a boom into STREAKS OF PHOSPHORESCENT LIGHT

Zoras disciples panic babbling looking for a place to hide
Zoras screeches at them to shut up

Houdin gives Colette his hand and she rises He waves to some of
Bou-Allems servants who slide a small wooden platform before Bou-
Allem and Zoras

On the platform a plank is held up at the corners by four tall
poles 5 high Colette steps up onto the platform With Houdins
assistance she climbs onto the plank and lies flat on her back

HOUDIN
Zoras shows you illusions of fire
poison wickedness I instead
wish to bring you peace relaxation
a feeling of being lighter than air
itself

With grand style Houdin removes the first pole Colette remains
horizontal

Houdin holds that pole aloft for effect then hurls it into the
bonfire With similar pomp he removes the next pole Colette
still floats in mid-air

Bou-Allems mouth hangs wide open JZoras worried for the first
time begins watching Bou-Allems reactions instead of the illusion

Houdin removes the final two poles He slides the plank itself
out from under Colette and throws them all into the fire

Colette hangs in the air completely unsupported

Suddenly Zoras springs forward towards the stage lunging at Colette
Just as hes about to bound on to the platform

Darcy blocks his path waving his sword point at Zoras chest
forcing him back from the platform

Bou-Allem rebukes Zoras in Arabic Zoras slinks back to his place
rage steaming from every pore

Houdin snaps his fingers toward Darcys sword

HOUDIN
Captain may I

Darcy lobs his sword by the hilt Houdin catches it with panache
Houdin circles the levitated Colette passing the sword blade above

beneath around in front of behind and alongside her at every
possible angle No strings No supports

Bou-Allem begins chuckling with sheer delight Hes yery impressed

At last Houdin takes Colettes hand and guides her down to the
platform She curtseys to Bou-Allem then proudly returns to her seat

BOU-ALLEM
Zoras Can you match this magic

ZORAS
French-man I have heard that by

magic you can make yourself invulnerable
to a bullec

BOU-ALLEM
Can this be true

HOUDIN
I have done this in the past Yes

On cue a Dervish hands Zoras two dueling pistols

ZORAS
Then I challenge you to a duel Let
me shoot at you now with one of these
Pistols If you do not die then I
give you permission to shoot at me
(to Bou-Allem) By this you shall
know whom Allah will favor

Naked fear on Colettes face Bou-Allem noting Colettes reaction
turns sympathetically to Houdin

BOU-ALLEM
My friend I do not think this is
an honorable test You have my
permission to refuse it

Houdin just stares at Zoras thinking intently A moment of tension

HOUDIN
On the contrary I accept the challenge

COLETTE
(a whispered gulp)
No

HOUDIN
However for such strong magic
defying the very hand of death itself
I require six hours at prayers

BOU-ALLEM
Is this acceptable to Zoras

ZORAS
Six hours should be long enough for
you to prepare to die

INT - PALACE STAIRCASE NIGHT

Bou-Allem tarries at the foot of the stairs with Houdin and Colette
He places his hand on Houdins shoulder

BOU-ALLEM
(genuinely concerned)
My friend Is there anything you
require for your meditations You
have only to ask

HOUDIN
A secure room with no windows and
complete privacy

BOU-ALLEM
Granted I shall post my best guards
No one shall disturb your prayers
until the sun rises

INT - HOUDINS BEDROOM SUITE NIGHT

The moment they enter Houdin starts rummaging intently through his
trunks digging out supplies He doesnt stop while they talk
Colette trails around the room desperately hopeful

COLETTE
So how will you manage it

HOUDIN
I dont know yet

This is mek what Colette wants to hear

COLETTE
You mean you havent chosen which
method youre going to use to--

HOUDIN
Imean I dont know yet (sarcastic)
I dont think Zoras will let me tamper
with his pistols God but the mans
clever I never saw that coming

COLETTE
Then what possessed you to say yes
Your pride again Is that what this
is about

HOUDIN
Colette this is not helping I£ you
have any ideas Im happy to hear

them Otherwise leave me alone and
let me think

Houdin keeps working He dumps candles chemical bottles matches
-- anything else thats useful -- into a satchel Colette tries
to grab him slow him down

COLETTE
Will you stop for one minute

Angry Houdin hurls a deck of cards across the room It lands on
the bed and fans out

HOUDIN
Colette Ive got six hours to invent
a new way to stop a bullet Maybe
well talk about this tomorrow
He opens the door to leave
COLETTE
(shouting after him)
I hope Zoras has good aim
He slams the door closed behind him leaving Colette alone and
furious

INT - STAIRWAY BOU-ALLEMS PALACE NIGHT

Houdin storms down the stairs

INT - HOULDINS BEDROOM SUITE NIGHT

Colette still fuming yanks off her jewelry piece by piece and
flings it on the bed

She kicks off her shoes and begins ripping off her clothes all
the way down to her corset and pantalettes She unpins her hair
and shakes it free

Standing before a full-length mirror she calms down a bit and
curiously considers her reflection

MIRROR SHOT -- COLETTE

She pushes her hands up through her hair and slowly swivels her
torso erotically like a bellydancer

Faint bellydancing MUSIC begins to play inside her head Colette
starts humming the dissonent tune

LOW SHOT THROUGH A BASKETWEAVE PATTERN
Across the room Colette shimmies and hums before the mirror

ANGLE WIDENS AND RISES

As Colette gets lost in her dance the lid of a tall basket across
the room jiggles and falls off A huge COBRA rises up out of the
basket and slithers out onto the floor towards Colette

Colette is totally unaware of the threat behind her She continues
to shimmy in front of the mirror

The Cobra stops six feet behind Colette and rears its spectacular
hooded head as if readying to strike

-But no Instead mesmerized by her movements the snake starts
imitating Colette swaying from side to side

COLETTES POV

As she moves around dancing she catches a glimpse in the mirror
of the swaying Cobra behind her She freezes The Cobra hisses

DARCY (0S)
Keep dancing A slow steady rhythm

REVEAL

Darcy perched on the windowsill slowly climbing into the room
Colette is nearly as surprised by him as by the snake

DARCY
Make him keep his eyes on you

Colette terrified nervously resumes her sinewy dance -- this
time for the snake The Cobra responds by swaying its head from
side to side utterly fascinated

Colette also resumes humming as loudly as she can Darcy draws
his sword and creeps around behind the Cobra

DARCY
Dont waste your breath Snakes are
Stone deaf
Colette stops humming She keeps dancing

COLETTE
H-How longve you been spying on me

DARCY
(still creeping)
I wasnt spying HAHHH

Darcy leaps forward With the quickness of a cobra himself he
swings his sword and severs the Cobras neck Colette squeals

Darcy goes after the Cobras head snapping away on the floor
DARCY
I knocked and you didnt answer I
thought something might be wrong

He spears the head with the tip of his sword Though decapitated
the fangs keep biting Darcy dumps the snake head in the basker
Colette meanwhile grabs at some clothing to shield herself

COLETTE
Are you sure thats the reason Ive
heard of men who like to peek at women
in their underclothing

Darcy dumps the snakes long still-twisting corpse in the basket
as well and closes the lid

DARCY
Madame I just saved your life If
you werent so busy auditioning for
Bou-Allems harem maybe you would
have heard me knocking

COLETTE
I was net auditioning for anyones
harem The very idea repulses me

DARCY
Right

Darcy quickly searches the room making a mess looking through luggage
Pulling apart bedclothes poking behind wall hangings with his sword

COLETTE
What are you doing Stop it

DARCY
Im not leaving until I know this
room is secure

COLETTE
Get away from there Those are my
Private things

Darcy stabs his knife into a drawer of Colettes dressing table
extracts a hairbrush He holds it out on the point of his knife

DARCY
This your private hairbrush

She angrily seizes the brush He stabs his knife into the drawer
once again This time he extracts a small deadly viper and holds
it out to her dangling on his knife point

DARCY
This your private asp

Colette recoils Darcy cuts up the asp and throws the pieces in the
basket as well He wipes his sword and knife clean on a piece of
bed canopy silk before sheathing them

DARCY

I have to report this to Bou-Allem
You can have your room back now

He turns towards the door abruptly Colette blocks his way

COLETTE
Im sorry I apologize

DARCY
Dont bother

He tries to push past but Colette grabs his sleeve

COLETTE
I said Im sorry

She doesnt even realize how hard she is clutching Darcys arm

Darcy reaches over and squeezes her wrist forcefully removing her
grip But having touched her now he wont let go

DARCY
I have to go

Defiantly she yanks her wrist free

COLETTE
Then go Im not stopping you

He doesnt budge an inch

COLETTE
What are you waiting for

Saddenly Darcy grabs her around the waist and kisses her hard
castead of pushing him away she kisses back with startling ferocity

Colette starts to pull Darcys shirt off Clutching and tearing
at each other in feverish passion they sink to the bed

They roll frenziedly across the bed still kissing Darcys eyes
dart past Colette and abruptly lock onto

Houdins playing cards strewn across the pillow inches away --
practically slapping him in the face

Darcy stops cold He wrenches himself away from Colette and stands
up Colette pushes herself up on her elbows

COLETTE
What is it Whats wrong

Darcy panting shakes his head Summoning all his willpower he
backs away from the bed and rebuttons his shirt

DARCY
There are enough people trying to kill
your husband tonight already

Darcy snatches up his sword and exits Colette starts to sweep the
cards off the bed in anger -- then stops as shes overwhelmed by a
flood of remorse Fighting back tears she clutches a wad of cards
to her heart and collapses onto the pillows
INT - HOUDINS PRIVATE ROOM NIGHT

Houdin works feverishly his equipment and gadgets spread all over
His powerful ELECTROMAGNET plugged into its battery hums faintly

Houdin fingers Darcys military pistol and struggles to hold it
steady two feet from the Electromagnet He lets go and the Magnet
SNAPS the iron pistol to itself

He fingers a few lead balls then tosses them on the Electromagnet
with irritation He catches them as they roll off not held by the
magnetism

Utterly exhausted Houdin checks his pocketwatch 438 His time
-- maybe his life -- is running short

Houdin rubs his eyes runs his hands over his sweaty face Hes
gotten nowhere and hes out of ideas

He forces himself to sit up straight and takes a deep breath
Functioning on sheer will he opens his chemistry kit

EXT - PALACE COURTYARD SUNRISE

Pink sunlight paints the western end of the courtyard A peaceful
place with only a tinkling fountain to break the stillness

People begin gathering in little groups Bou-Allem and his household

Zoras and his Disciples in the shadows Darcy Bartolote and the
other Legionnaires

Colette is conspicuously absent

Houdin enters the courtyard alone somewhat tense He strides over
to Bou-Allem

BOU-ALLEM
My friend Are you ready

HOUDIN
Momentarily Your Eminence

Houdin crosses to Darcy who seems oddly withdrawn this morning

HOUDIN
Wheres Colette She should be here

DARCY
a beat)
You havent seen her

HOUDIN
Last night we had harsh words

DARCY

Im sure thats not it Perhaps the
strain --

HOUDIN
(grabbing the excuse)
--Of course Youre right The strain
(forcing a wry smile) What is it you
Legionnaires say ‘Today is a good day
to die

He starts to turn away but Darcy grips his arm firmly

DARCY
Not today

Houdin turns back to Bou-Allem but stops as he sees
HOUDINS POV

-Colette She has come after all Pale and solemn she stops
at the courtyards edge alone

The sight of Colette lifts Houdins spirits Suddenly energized
he approaches Zoras and Bou-Allem

ZORAS
Is the lying Frenchman ready to prove
that he is a god

HOUDIN
You grow tiresome Zoras Produce
your weapons

Zoras lays his two pistols on a small table next to a horn of
gunpowder a handful of lead bullets wadding and a smooth stick

HOUDIN
Load the pistols and give them to
Bou-Allem to test

ZORAS
(as he loads the guns)
You waste time Frenchman These
guns have not left my side

Zoras hands the loaded pistols to Bou-Allen

BOU-ALLEM
And what do you wish me to do

HOUDIN
Shoot them Prove the vents are clear
and the pistols are in working order

Bou-Allem fires the weapons into the dirt An ear-splitting CRACK
Then another CRACK Both shots raise puffs of dust

BOU-ALLEM
I am satisfied They are real

He sets the pistols on the table

HOUDIN
Again Zoras This time may I suggest
a double charge of powder

Zoras glowers and pours gunpowder into each chamber

HOUDIN
Now select two bullets and carve your
mark into the lead

Zoras chooses his bullets carefully then draws a fearsome knife
CLOSE-UP ON
each lead ball as Zoras carves a distinctive evil-looking mark

HOUDIN
Give me the bullets

Houdin holds out his hand Zoras is reluctant

BOU-ALLEM
Do as he says

Zoras hands them over suspiciously Houdin delicately pinches each
bullet between thumb and index finger so theyre visible to everyone

HOUDIN
See the marks Zoras has made so
that you may recognize his bullets

He carries the bullets around in a circle to show the carved marks
to all the important witnesses starting with Bou-Allem Then he
returns to the table

With everyones eyes glued to his movements Houdin openly slides a
bullet into the chamber of each pistol There appear to be no tricks

HOUDIN
Would ‘The Learned One like to
complete the loading

Zoras eagerly takes over

ZORAS
Infidel You will soon burn in
the deepest pits of hell

HOUDIN
Ill say hello to your father

Zoras sets down one gun keeps the other

HOUDIN
I remind you all of our agreement
First he fires at me with a weapon
of his choice If I live I have
the privilege of firing at him

BOU-ALLEM
That is the bargain

ZORAS
You shall not fire the second shot
French-man

HOUDIN
You shall stand there I shall stand
there ten paces away Do you think
you can hit me from that distance

Zoras laughs wickedly with his disciples As far as theyre
concerned theyve won

Houdin strips bare to the waist handing his garments to a
servant He is in remarkably fit shape

Zoras and Houdin walk to their spots Houdin stands at rigid
attention steeling himself for the test Zoras milking his
moment of triumph for all its worth slowly aims the pistol

ZORAS
Bou-Allem Behbdld the power of
Allah who destroys all those who
mock his name
Colette closes her eyes
Zoras fires CRACK

Houdin rocks backward as if hit -- then raises his arms above his
head rotating to show hes unharmed JZorasand his disciples
stare in disbelief Zoras looks at his pistol as if betrayed

Houdin grins revealingthe BULLET caught between his teeth

Bou-Allems household explodes in cheers Darcy and Bartolote

pound each other on the back in relief Colette her eyes open
again smiles weakly

Houdin takes the lead ball from his teeth offers it to BouAllem
Bou-Allem examines it and joyfully proclaims

BOU-ALLEM
It is the same mark

Darcy joins Colette who is now glowing with pride

DARCY
How did he do it

COLETTE
The question is how could I have
doubted him

Incensed Zoras runs back to the table for the other pistol Houdin
lunges grabbing it out from under Zoras hand

HOUDIN
No-no-no We had an agreement
Its my turn

ZORAS
It was a trick

HOUDIN
Then let me see you perform the
same trick

Zoras starts backing away Houdin follows him around the courtyard
maintaining his 10-pace distance aiming the pistol at Zoras face
until Zoras quaking backs into the corner of the courtyard wall

ZORAS
I I cannot

HOUDIN
Am Ia true marabout Is French
magic greater than Kabyle magic

ZORAS
(bitterly)
Y-you are greater Your magic is true

HOUDIN
Then I will show you still more of it
Turn your eyes to that wall

Zoras slowly turns his head sideways
HOUDIN
Only by French mercy do I spare your
miserable life Behold

Houdin swings the pistol away from Zoras head and aims straight
at the wall insead He fires CRACK

The bullet strikes the whitewashed wall and a splattering of
BLOOD runs down the wall

A Dervish stumbles over to the wall to examine the blood He runs
his finger across it shuddering then touches a dab to his tongue

Terror fills the Dervishs eyes as he tastes real blood He cries to

his comrades who fall prostrate towards Houdin wailing for mercy
HOLD ON

Zoras black with anger as he sees his followers collapsing in fear

EXT - PALACE GATES DAY

Bou-Allem personally sees off Houdin and his party Their caravan
ready to roll waits in the background

BOU-ALLEM
My friend I will give you some
advice Do not waste time on your
journey back to Algiers In Zoras
you have made a death enemy

He kisses Houdin three times on the cheeks

EXT CLIFFS OVER TIFFELFEL DAY

Moving briskly Houdins caravan travels the rim trail atop the
white cliffs overlooking Tiffelfel

EXT - MOUNTAIN CAMPSITE NIGHT

Darcy Houdin Rachid and a Legionnaire SERGEANT huddle over a
survey map by campfire light Darcy uses his dagger as a pointer

DARCY
Sergeant LaMartine

LAMARTINE
Yes sir

DARCY

Im placing you in command Take a
dozen men and make haste for Fort
Khemis Here

HOUDIN
I dont like dividing the party

RACHID
A very wise idea Zoras will chase
after the wrong enemy

LAMARTINE
Thats a three day ride

DARCY
Itll take Zoras at least a day even
two to gather an army of any respectable
size Theyll hunt for us first along
the main road We wont be there

HOUDIN
We were promised safe conduct the
entire journey Protection against
our enemies

DARCY
If you had shot Zoras when you had
the chance you wouldnt have any
enemies left

Stung by the criticism Houdin nods reluctantly
EXT - MOUNTAIN CAMPSITE DAWN

Two Legionnaires set fire to Houdins wagon still partially loaded
and push it over a ridge down into a gully

Darcy comes over as Houdin watches his precious gear go up in smoke
HOUDIN

Some of that equipment took years
to construct

DARCY
We cant take the wagon where were
going and it would only slow the
others down

HOUDIN
Youre right of course Still

Sergeant LaMartine rides up to Darcy

LAMARTINE
All present and accounted for sir
Sheik Rachid asked us to take the camels

DARCY
Do as he asks Good luck Sergeant

LAMARTINE
The same to you Captain

Darcy returns LaMartines salute

EXT - MOUNTAIN TRAIL SUNRISE

The expedition splits up into two groups The larger detachment of
Legionnaires including camels canters down the wide main trail

Remaining behind on the mountain trail are Darcy Houdin Colette
Bartolote three other Legionnaires Rachid and his five cousins
Leading two extra pack horses they head up a difficult path into
the forbidding mountain wilderness

One of the Legionnaires follows on foot With a leafy branch he
wipes away tell-tale hoof tracks

EXT - TWISTING MOUNTAIN SWITCHBACK DAY

High in the desolate craggy Aures Mountains Colette rides up
alongside Darcy and Houdin and points ahead

COLETTE
What is that up there

COLETTES POV

Shimmering like a mirage in the distance is what appears to be a
castle built into the side of the mountains

DARCY
The Fortress of the Assassins

HOUDIN
(greatly impressed)

Thats it I dont suppose we could
stop and have a look around

DARCY
Not a chance We must cross the Chelia
Gorge before nightfall Once we burn -
the bridge even Zoras can‘t follow us

Houdin squints ahead to the castle disappointed

EXT - TRAIL TO FORT KHEMIS DAY

Sergeant LaMartines detachment canters confidently down into a
ezater-like canyon Suddenly the front riders rein up at the
bone-chilling sight ahead

LAMARTINE
Holy Jesus

SERGEANTS POV

A huge ambush force headed by Zoras appears dead ahead cutting
off the trail at the far rim of the crater

PRIVATE
Sergeant

LAMARTINE
Oh God The son of a bitch already
has his army Retreat Retreat
The company panics and wheels around to retreat But--
LAMARTINES POV
Zoras ambush has cut off the trail behind them as well
LAMARTINE

turns his horse in all directions looking for a way out- The
situation is hopeless

INTERCUT WITH LAMARTINES POV - MOVING

‘Looking upward and around Zoras troops -- over 200 men --
completely surround their victims all around the canyons rim

LaMartine draws his pistol despair written on his face He
knows his death is seconds away

CLOSE-UP ON
Zoras An evil smile He drops his hand

Bt

ANGLE ON
a row of Kabyle rifles firing We hear a FUSILLADE of 200 SHOTS

Soldiers and horses begin to collapse as the bullets connect
SCREAMS from the dying Legionnaires

MATCH SOUND DISSOLVE TO
The HOWLING of a piercing WIND

EXT - HIGH MOUNTAIN TRAIL DAY

Darcy leads Houdins party around the curve of a steep mountain
fighting the wind

DARCY
Just around this next bend

The party rounds the bend and stops short stunned
THEIR POV - EDGE OF CHELIA GORGE

The 300 wooden bridge that once spanned the gorge extends about
70 feet out into nothingness -- and then ends

The bridge has been burnt to a crisp from the far side of the
gorge Their escape route has been cut off

Darcy is devastated He dismounts and walks to the brink Houdin
joins Darcy at the edge of the bridge and begins inspecting the area

HOUDIN
How could this happen

DARCY
Zoras got here first

HOUDIN
I thought you said it would take him
days to raise his army

DARCY
I was wrong He was planning this
from the beginning And I played
right into his hands

HOUDIN
Is there somewhere we can camp for
the night and re-strategize

DARCY
Yes On the other side of the gorge

Darcy stalks away furious back to his horse Colette goes to him

COLETTE
Its not your fault

DARCY
Just trying to be a hero thats all
Iwas doing (slaps his saddle) Idior

COLETTE
Trey You are not an idiot

She shuts up as Houdin joins them

HOUDIN
Theres no other way across

Darcy shakes his head Bartolote trudges over fighting the wind

BARTOLOTE
Captain weve got to get out of this
wind Itll be dark soon and cold as--

DARCY
I know When I want your opinion
Corporal Ill ask for it Get back
in ranks

Bartolote is shocked by the rebuke but he obeys Darcys orders
Darcy stomps back in a huff toward the cliffs edge Houdin and
Colette follow him Houdins manner is cold and businesslike

HOUDIN
How about the Fortress of the Assassins

DARCY
Wed probably walk straight into a
Kabyle ambush there too

HOUDIN
(faultlessly logical)

We cant go forward Our path has been
burned beneath us We cant return to
Bou-Allems Our safe conduct is
meaningless We cant forge our way over
the mountains -- much too dangerous We
cant go back to the main road Im sure
youre aware Sergeant LaMartine and the
others have certainly been killed by now

DARCY
(bitterly)
I know

HOUDIN
Your plan has simply failed thus far
thats all Now we can--

COLETTE
You cant blame this on him None
of it Its thanks to your pride were
here in the first place If it werent
for Trey we wouldnt even be alive
right now You should be grateful

She whirls around and marches off Houdin and Darcy are equally
surprised at her fervor

HOUDIN
So What about the Fortress
EXT - LAND BRIDGE OUTSIDE FORTRESS LATE AFTERNOON
Long shadows Less than an hour of light left in the sky

Darcy leads the party single file over a harrowingly narrow land
bridge which spans a 600-foot wide chasm

Colette glances nervously over the edge

COLETTES POV

straight down 2000 feet No bottom in sight

As the party rounds a small promontory they see looming overhead
THE FORTRESS OF THE ASSASSINS

The Fortress is built into the side of a mountain under an
overhanging cliff face Designed for defense it rises eight
stories behind its battlements

The architecture is part medieval castle part Persian monastery
Bits of the facade are crumbling but the building is still
massive oppressive

The entrance gate is a 15-foot-high double door of iron directly
ahead The fortress is completely isolated by the chasm the party
just crossed with the narrow land bridge providing the only access

The party is awestruck at the sight of the forbidding Fortress

COLETTE
Who built this And why did they leave

HOUDIN
More to the point how do we get in
EXT FORTRESS GATE LATE AFTERNOON

Bartolote and another Legionnaire sling a grappling hook over the
castle wall It catches

Bartolote pulls himself steadily up the rope hand over hand until
he disappears over the wall

EXT - FORTRESS RAMPART LATE AFTERNOON

Bartolote rolls over the wall lands then jumps up drawing his

sword as if expecting to be attacked No ones there We see
little as Bartolote nervously looks around then heads in
EXT - FORTRESS GATE SUNSET
Its getting darker The party at the gate is getting restless

DARCY
Im going after him
HOUDIN
(checking his pocket watch)
Lets be patient shall we Wait
five more minutes

DARCY
In my profession waiting gets you killed

Rachid points to the door We hear an IRON BOLT slide back

RACHID
Look

One of the giant iron doors slowly begins to creak inward Darcy
is the first to run over and push

DARCY
Come on

Everyone else rushes to help push the heavy gate open a few feet
Bartolote appears from the inside exhausted and shaken

As the party enters the oppressive gates

DARCY
What took you so long

BARTOLOTE

Sir you wont believe it
INT - FORTRESS CORRIDOR SUNSET
On foot by lantern light Bartolote leads Darcy Houdin Colette
and three Arab guards down a stone passage to an open doorway
The others wrinkle their noses - something smells incredibly bad
INT - FORTRESS GUARD ROOM SUNSET
The party steps inside and chokes at the sight of
a dozen DEAD KABYLE WARRIORS sprawled across the stone floor
The eyes of the corpses are wide open grotesquely pushing from
their sockets Their tongues are black swollen out of their

mouths Their hands are black and puffy clenched in fists

Darcy and Houdin both try to shield Colette from the sight but
she stubbornly stares past them at the dead bodies

COLETTE
You want me to faint Sorry to
disappoint you

Still she pulls out a handkerchief to block the smell
bends down to inspect the corpses

HOUDIN
Zoras men

DARCY
Iwas right They were waiting for
us Only something got to them first

He prods at one corpses clenched fist with his boot
PIECES fall out and CLINK onto the stone floor

BARTOLOTE
Gold

But before he can pick the coins up

HOUDIN
Hold it Corporal

DARCY
Dont touch that Thats an order

BARTOLOTE
But its gold Captain

HOUDIN
Thats what killed these men

BARTOLOTE
I dont understand

Darcy

Two GOLD

Houdin kicks the coin with his foot kneels and examines the corpse

careful to touch nothing

DARCY -
Poison

HOUDIN
Something on the metal that penetrates
the skin

DARCY

(admiringly)

They say love of money is the root of
all evil

HOUDIN

The assassins may have died out 400
years ago but it seems they left this
place as an ongoing monument to their
art form as it were

BARTOLOTE
Thats diabolical

HOUDIN
Or poetic actually Depending on
your point of view ss

DARCY
Wed better warn the others

EXT COURTYARD SUNSET

Darcy Houdin Colette Bartolote and the three Guards rush back
into the courtyardtoo late -

They find two Legionnaires lying on the floor dead with the same
gruesome symptoms as the dead Kabyles

Rachid the other two Arabs and the remaining Legionnaire PRIVATE
CASLAV are huddled together in shock A spilled pouch of gold
coins lies on the dirt

RACHID
They found it under the staircase
They were like children

BARTOLOTE
(to Darcy)
Are we all going to die here Just
like that
RACHID
Captain We must not miss our prayers
Not today
DARCY

Of course (pointing) East is that way

As the Arabs head for the eastern side of the courtyard Houdin
looks at the dead men with disdain and shakes his head

HOUDIN
Fools Absolute fools

DARCY
It wasnt their fault

HOUDIN
Anyone can spot a trap

DARCY
You didnt spot Zorass trap The
bridge the ambush

HOUDIN
Im not the leader of this expedition

DARCY
Would you like to be Is that what
youre saying

91

HOUDIN
If I were in charge I certainly
wouldnt--

COLETT

Excuse me generals

Shes got their attention

COLETTE
Youre both so clever tell me this --
Where is Zoras now And how long will
it be until he finds us

Darcy and Houdin look at each other then gaze around the fortress
HOUDIN

I wonder what other charming toys our

friends have left behind
INT - FORTRESS BANQUET HALL NIGHT
Darcy leads Houdin Colette Caslav two Arab guards and Bartolote
bringing up the rear into the banquet hall The men wear military
packs and carry oil lanterns
The banquet hall is a huge room with an air of decay and malevolence
Long half-rotted wooden tables line the room the walls of which
are draped with the tattered remains of elaborate tapestries

COLETTE
What are we looking for

DARCY
If it kills us youll know youve
found it

HOUDIN
Wonder what thats for

Houdin scrambles over a pile of rubble in a corner of the room
toward a round hole in the floor

DARCY
Careful

Houdin sticks his lantern into the hole

INT - STONE WELL SHAFT CONTINUOUS

as Houdin sticks his head in

The well goes down farther than Houdin can see with his flickering
lantern Running down the shaft on a rusted chain-and-pulley
mechanism is a string of wooden buckets many rotted out

we hear a faint WHOOSHING sound from below
INT - BANQUET HALL CONTINUOUS

DARCY
What is it
Houdin grabs a chunk of rubble Timing the fall with his pocketwatch
he drops the rock down the shaft Six seconds later a FAINT SPLASH

HOUDIN

Running water About 200 feet below us
BARTOLOTE

A river
HOUDIN

Why not Any castle has to have a
fresh water source

He climbs back down pleased with his discovery

COLETTE
Maybe thats a way out

DARCY
Dont count on it Any stream in these
parts would only carry us further
underground Our drowned corpses would
probably pop up in an oasis in the
middle of the Sahara somewhere

HOUDIN

Youre not an optimist are you
INT FORTRESS CORRIDOR NIGHT
The party heads through a long low-ceilinged corridor They turn
a corner and Darcy stops as they enter
INT - UNDERGROUND ROTUNDA NIGHT
A huge rotunda of stone block construction 80 feet across
The party is at the top of a narrow winding staircase Each step
is a single wedge of stone jutting out a mere 12 inches from the

curving rotunda wall with a sheer drop straight down

At various levels across from the stairs several passageways
inexplicably open into the nothingness of the rotunda

The side of the stairway has no railing but opens to a black abyss
The lanterns are too dim to reveal whatever lies far below

Colette advances eagerly

COLETTE
This must be the way

But Darcy blocks her path

DARCY
Let me go first It could be slippery

He uncoils two lengths of rope knots them together and ties one
end around his chest He tosses the other end to Bartolote
gesturing also to the two Arabs

DARCY
You three Just in case

Bartolote and the two Arabs anchor the rope around their waists
Darcy lights a torch and starts cautiously down the stairs hugging
the wall He tests each step before putting his weight on it runs
his hand along the wall checking for anything unusual

BARTOLOTE
Captain You still all right

DARCY
Nothing so far

CLOSE-UP ON

Darcys feet as he continues to step down

Then as he hits the next step it SINKS slightly beneath his weight
A great RUMBLING begins behind the wall Darcy looks up startled
Below him where the stairs fade into darkness the individual steps
begin to DISAPPEAR one after another quickly RETRACTING into the
rotunda wall The sheer drop into nothingness CASCADES UPWARD
toward Darcy

Darcy turns to run back up the stairs But hes not fast enough
The stairs continue to retract into the wall past the step which
triggered the boobytrap

Darcy FALLS as the stairs disappear from under his feet

FOLLOW DARCY

falling

AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS

the men gripping Darcys rope brace themselves The rope snaps
taut and we hear Darcy YELP

BACK ON DARCY

The jerk of the rope wrenches Darcys body His TORCH SNUFFS OUT
as it falls from his hand

Meanwhile the upwards cascade STOPS just six steps from the top

HOUDIN
Darcy

Darcys voice echoes up from the blackness

DARCY
Im fine Drop me a lantern

Houdin ties a lantern to another rope and lowers it

INT - PIT UNDER STAIRS CONTINUOUS

Darcy dangling like a hooked fish grabs the lantern REVEALING
-he is swinging above a deadly pit of four-foot high stone spikes
razor sharp and jaggedly barbed at the tips Skulls and broken
skeletons litter the pit with some jammed onto the spikes

As Darcy catches his breath another low RUMBLE starts -- and the
trap stairs begin to reset themselves in place from the bottom up

DARCY
Pull me up
INT - TOP OF ROTUNDA STAIRS NIGHT

The others pull up the rope hand-over-hand Houdin and Bartolote
help Darcy back onto the landing Darcy unties himself

COLETTE
Are you all right

DARCY
Yes I think

HOUDIN

Which step triggered that reaction
Darcy stares at him blankly

HOUDIN
You mean you didnt count

Darcy sighs heavily and starts to retie the safety rope

DARCY
Lets try this once more
HOUDIN
Very nice work by the way
DARCY
Thanks
HOUDIN

No no The trap Excellent design

INT - FOOT OF ROTUNDA STAIRS ENTRANCE TO CATACOMBS NIGHT

With the skeleton-filled pit just behind them the party stops
dead in front of us looking from side to side in confusion

REVERSE ANGLE -- GROUPS POV

as we PAN across a conjunction of five identical tunnel openings
Which way to go Darcy doesnt hesitate He picks a tunnel

DARCY
This way

INT RIVER CAVERN NIGHT

The party emerges from the tunnel into a limestone cavern The
LOUD RUSHING WATER is very close now Just a few more yards and

DARCY
Theres your river my wizard friend
Care to jump in and see where it leads

Everyones hopes are dashed by the sight of the river a swift torrent
BLASTING OUT of the high side of the cavern and shooting through a
deep channel to the opposite cavern wall where it disappears into
blackness The exit tunnel has six inches of air space if that

HOUDIN
After you

COLETTE
So theres no way out

Meanwhile one of the Arabs hoists a lantern to examine a shaft in the
ceiling directly above the river Houdin joins him finds coiled rusty
chains and decayed wooden buckets piled near the edge of the river

HOUDIN
As I thought The Hashashim drew
their water to the top levels from
here Very nice

BARTOLOTE
But what good does it do us

Houdin rummages in his pack

HOUDIN
Water is always useful

BARTOLOTE
Great So we wont die of thirst

HOUDIN
Never let your imagination be hindered
by the facts

He carefully spoons out a mere sprinkling of white powder from an
apothecary jar into a cigarette paper He twists it shut reseals
the jar and throws the paper packet into the river

BOOM A white hot EXPLOSION as the packet hits the water sending
spray flying everywhere The rest of the party whirls in shock

DARCY
What was phar

HOUDIN
Pure sodium Not to be confused with
salt for your soup

Darcy appreciatively watches the smoke fade He approaches Houdin
DARCY
Jean-Pierre tell me what else have
you got in that bag

INT - CATACOMES MOVING NIGHT

Down at this level the corridors are dug out of-rough rock not
the finished stonework of the higher levels

Darcy and Houdin lead the way Further back Bartolote helps
Colette clamber over rubble blocking their way

BARTOLOTE
(nodding ahead)
What do you think theyre talking about

COLETTE
If I know my husband hes working out
a plan

BARTOLOTE

A plan would be good
ANGLE AHEAD TO
Houdin and Darcy who keep their voices low

HOUDIN
So what are our chances Militarily

DARCY
The truth (an uncomfortable beat)
Zoras knows where we are Hes only
waiting for daylight And hell bring
a small army with him Even if we had
enough weapons and ammunition -- which
we dont -- we couldnt resist an all-
out assault

HOUDIN
Cant we just surrender

DARCY
You wouldnt like what they do to
captives Trust me (shrugging)
Any way you look at it were dead

A sense of fatalistic relief ripples through Houdin A moment of
complete understanding passes between the two men

They begin to climb a claustrophobic stairway

HOUDIN
What do we say to the others

DARCY
What any commander says before battle
We tell them what they want to hear
and hope we get lucky

EXT - RAMPART NIGHT

Darcy and Bartolote dubiously inspect several decayed catapults

DARCY
Can these be repaired

BARTOLOTE
Iocan try

EXT - COURTYARD NIGHT

Activity everywhere Some of the Arabs carry wood up the rampart
steps to Bartolote and Darcy who are hammering away on the broken
catapults

Across the courtyard Houdin sits on the floor surrounded by
tools and what looks like an old-fashioned chemistry kit thick
glass apothecary jars filled with strange substances

Houdin carefully measures chemicals into an iron saucepan a white
powder of some sort a clear liquid He picks up a bottle of rum
sniffs it Nearby Colette warms herself at a small campfire

COLETTE
Whats the rum for

Houdin answers by taking a stiff swig

COLETTE
Can I do anything

Houdin doesnt look up from his work Total concentration

HOUDIN
Yes Take off your clothes

COLETTE
Jean-Pierre There are people around

HOUDIN
Not all your clothes Just your
petticoats To start with

Colette ducks behind a pillar and hikes up her skirt amused

COLETTE
I must say darling this is a side of
you I havent seen before

HOUDIN
I need cotton As much as you can lay
your hands on

COLETTE
Wouldnt you prefer silk Its ever
so much softer against the skin

HOUDIN
(sharply)
Cotton Clothes bandages anything

Private Caslav starts to pass by -- but stops to gawk at Colettes
bare thighs as she peels her petticoats and pantalettes off

HOUDIN
You Private Eyes front

Caslav snaps to attention Colette resettles her skirts and drops
her petticoats in front of Houdin

Houdin pours the clear liquid over chunks of yellow sulphur in a
skillet over the fire and watches it dissolve He mixes in a
white powder and adds yet another clear liquid from a bottle
Colette holds her nose

COLETTE
What are you cooking

HOUDIN
Guncotton

The word means nothing to Colette -- but it sure does to Private
Caslav who begins to back off

CASLAV
What

HOUDIN
Caslav Is that what they call you
Get me a barrel of some sort Ora
large cooking pot

CASLAV
Yes sir
He scurries away
COLETTE
What is it
HOUDIN

Bismuth solvent oi of vitriol and

He rips off a small strip of petticoat and using tongs soaks it in
the solution

HOUDIN (cont)
Strips of cellulose

He picks up the soaked strip of cloth with the tongs grabs a dagger
and moves to a nearby section of wall

At the wall Houdin chips out old mortar and stuffs the soaked cloth
deep between the stones He then pours a liquid trail of rum out to
a spot about eight feet from the wall

HOUDIN
Stand behind that pillar

Colette obeys but her curiosity drives her to step back out to watch

Houdin plucks a burning stick from the fire and torches the rum He
ducks behind a wall

FOLLOW THE FLAME
as it streaks across the floor and up the wall
THE WALL EXPLODES Large pieces of stone go flying

A chunk of rubble hits Colette square in the stomach and throws her
on her butt She shrieks

Immediately the Legionnaires working on the catapults jump to
their feer Darcy flies down the rampart stairs

DARCY
Colette

As the white smoke clears we see a four-foot square hole in the
wall Everyone in the courtyard begins to gather round

Darcy arrives and sweeps Colette up off the floor and into his arms

DARCY
Are you hurt

Houdin emerges from behind the wall and sees Darcy holding his wife

HOUDIN
Colette Can you stand alone

Houdin watches suspiciously as they slowly step apart Colette
cant take her eyes off Darcy Acutely aware of Houdins unspoken
accusation Darcy changes the subject

DARCY
What the hell were you doing

HOUDIN
Just a small experiment

10¢

CASLAV
Guncetton sir

DARCY
You must be out of your mind

HOUDIN
Insanity is a necessary part of the
creative process

DARCY
Are you trying to blow us to bits

HOUDIN

(coldly)
I know what Im doing Caslav
Come with me

CASLAV
Yes sir

Houdin heads abruptly into the fort Caslav right behind Darcy
immediately turns and heads away in the opposite direction

Colette left alone looks after them both

INT - STABLE ROOM NIGHT

Colette enters the room to find Danjou alone among the horses
trying to pick up a 100 lb keg of gunpowder His wooden hand
unable to grip keeps slipping

COLETTE
Let me help with that

DARCY
No I dont need your--

He drops the keg on the hard stone floor Gunpowder spills out

Colette kneels down and scoops up the spilt powder with both hands
Darcy strongarms her wrist to prevent her

DARCY
Ill take care of it Go back to
your husband

Colette shakes off his grasp and keeps scooping Darcy kmeels and
tries to outdo her at the same task

COLETTE
He doesnt need my help

DARCY
Neither do I

COLETTE
Were all going to die in a few hours
Cant we at least leave this earth
being honest with each other

They both rise as Darcy hefts the powderkeg onto his shoulder

DARCY
Were not going to die Were going
to send Zoras straight to perdition
and then youll return safe to Algiers
and sail home to France with your
famous husband

COLETTE
Even my famous husband couldnt sell
me that lie And hes a professional
Darcey starts toward the door
COLETTE

You wont say it will you
Darcy stops turns to meet her challenge
DARCY
If we do get out of this alive are
you getting on that ship Or are you
staying in Algiers
COLETTE

I-I dont know I cant think that
far ahead

from a big iron pot of liquid He packs the cloth tight
inside a rock fissure Behind him down the tunnel Bartolote
pours a long trail of gunpowder leading right to the fissure

3) IN THE ROTUNDA -- Two Arabs standing in the doorways opening
from different levels toss ropes to a third Arab standing on
the trap stairway The actual stair that trips the trap is
marked clearly with chalk The Third Arab carefully steps
over it and hammers a spike into the wall three stairs down

4) IN THE RIVER CAVERN -- Darcy leans precariously over the
river where it sweeps into the tunnel He hooks a saddlebag
onto a rope strung taut across the river

5) IN THE BANQUET HALL -- Filthy with paint and charcoal
Colette paints a mural of some sort on a large tarp spread
on the stone floor We cant decipher the design

6) ON THE LOWER LEVEL OF THE COURTYARD -- In a corner Houdin
works on an intricate device fitting into an iron box It
involves gears wires clock parts and many tiny gizmos

Several of Zoras troops point accusingly toward the upper part of
the Fortress Zoras looks up Hes not pleased

Above the rampart the French flag is raised on a makeshift flagpole
Sunlight strikes the banner gloriously as it flaps in the wind

Zoras barks out an angry command In perfect synch all 200 warriors
raise their longrifles and fire on the hated flag
INT - UPPER BATTLEMENT DAY

Bartolote ducks and rolls down the stairs just in time as a fusillade
of 200 bullets smashes all around him

BARTOLOTE
Good thing I didnt sing the Marseillaise

holes snaps and breaks apart The flag tumbles to the courtyard

Darcy runs to two Arabs team operating the first of three catapults
Mounted on each catapult arm is a wooden chest

DARCY
Ready first catapult

RACHID
Ready

Darcy rechecks the trajectory Hes satisfied

DARCY
Ready catapults two and three

Further down the rampart the Arabs manning the other catapults reply

ARABS
Two ready Three ready

DARCY
All right Lets thin out their
ranks Fire one

One of the Arabs lights a fuse attached to the first chest Rachid
swings an ax down on the catapults taut firing rope The rope
breaks The catapult hurls the chest out from the Fortress higher
and higher over the chasm

other two catapults ignite their fuses and ax their firing ropes

In quick succession TWO MORE CHESTS of coins are into the sky

EXT - FAR SIDE OF THE CHASM CONTINUOUS
FOLLOW TRAJECTORIES

as the two chests fly across the chasm One falls short EXPLODES
and drops uselessly into the gorge The other chest EXPLODES
directly over the Kabyle Armys heads Hundreds more GOLD COINS
pelt down on the enemy

The confused Kabyles are reckless at the sight of gleaming gold
scattered all over the ground They shove past each other to grab
up the treasure with their bare hands

Zoras screams orders to his men but to little avail Their gold
lust is too strong

Suddenly an OFFSCREEN WAIL OF PAIN shocks the men Some turn to
see the source of the cry

A Kabyle warrior still clutching his precious gold coins rakes
his hands over his face in acid pain

ANOTHER WAIL Then another Then another Meanwhile the first
victim falls on the dirt froths at the mouth and begins convulsing

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Kabyle warriors by the score falling prey to the same symptoms
Their tongues swelling gruesomely out of their mouths Palms
turning black Excruciating pain Stumbling falling writhing
on the ground Then dying horribly but quickly

A dozen Kabyles stumble off the cliff and fall to their doom

Zoras jolted by this sudden catastrophe calls a retreat to his
surviving troops -- about 125 men They gallop back from the chasm
brink leaving the dying to their agony

EXT - RAMPART DAY

Darcy Bartolote and the four Arabs jump and whoop in jubilation at
the enemys retreat Darcy yells over the battlements

DARCY
Dont hang me on details soldier
Man your firing position

A bullet blasts away a piece of stone six inches away Darcy and
Bartolote hit the deck Darcy gives him a dirty look

Bartolote crawls down the rampart as enemy bullets whiz overhead

EXT - LAND BRIDGE TO FORTRESS DAY

Half the Kabyle warriors many carrying ropes and grappling hooks
run single file across the land bridge to storm the gates while
the remaining 60 warriors cover them from the edge of the chasm

EXT - RAMPART DAY

The DEFENDERS -- Darcy Bartolote Caslav Rachid and the 5 other
Arabs -- fire on the INVADERS as they approach the Fortress gates
Their first shots connect The dead Invaders fall into the chasm
But the rest keep charging across the land bridge while the
Defenders stop to reload

Six grappling hooks land over the walls The Defenders rush to
dislodge them but a hail of bullets forces them back
EXT - FORTRESS WALL DAY

The Invaders begin climbing the ropes Two grappling hooks are
dislodged from above The climbers fall The others keep climbing
107
EXT - RAMPART DAY

The first Invader makes it to the top Darcy kicks him in the
teeth and sends him falling to his death

Another Kabyle reaches the top Rachid shoots him in the heart
then rifle butts a third climber to oblivion

A quick thrill of success -- then five mere grappling hooks take
hold Nothing stops these guys
EXT - FORTRESS WALL DAY

More Kabyles callously step over dead comrades and grab the ropes

EXT - RAMPART DAY
Darcy and Bartolote watch the next wave climbing the ropes

DARCY
Youd think theyd get tired of this

They tilt their pistols over the battlement to shoot two climbers
off the ropes

One Arab daringly leans out to do the same but before he can get
off his shot he is riddled by enemy bullets He tumbles over the
battlement knocking a climbing Kabyle off his rope

Bartolote picks a Kabyle climber up over his head and throws him 40
feet down into the courtyard where he breaks his neck

The Kabyles keep coming over the wall They stab an Arab reloading
his gun

Darcy dodges a bullet as he skewers one Kabyle Another Kabyle
attacks him with a scimitar and fences him backward down the
rampart steps

Caslav gets into a swordfight of his own Hes hopelessly
overmatched He loses his sword Laughing in his face his Kabyle
opponent slashes broadly -- and beheads Caslav

Caslavs head rolls off the rampart and bounces into the courtyard
More grappling hooks More Kabyles over the top Bartolote takes
them on hand-to-hand heaving them and their rifles down to the
courtyard

Darcy fences his opponent all over the rampart He finally spears
his opponents throat then whirls to take on more oncoming Kabyles
EXT - FORTRESS WALL DAY

More Kabyles scale the ropes More are right behind
EXT - COURTYARD DAY

Colette runs out from cover to retrieve the dead Kabyles rifles
She ducks as another dead Kabyle crashes into the courtyard

She grabs his rifle too

EXT - RAMPART DAY

A sheer frenzy of a battle with five men holding off 20 enemies
at a time Darcy is superhuman all over the battlement a one-
man army He skewers two Kabyles with one thrust

The three Arabs fighting for their dead brothers are just as fierce

EXT - FORTRESS WALL DAY

Three dislodged ropes fall Ten Kabyles drop to their deaths

EXT - RAMPART DAY

While Darcy fences another dangerous opponent a Kabyle aims his
rifle point blank at Darcys back

But before he can pull the trigger the Kabyle takes a bullet through
his own chest Shock on his face he collapses and falls to reveal
EXT - COURTYARD DAY

Colette dropping a smoking rifle Shes behind a pillar with a
pile of 15 rifles next to her

She picks up another rifle and shoots another Kabyle on the rampart
BLAM She throws that one aside picks up another one aims and
fires BLAM Another Kabyle dies She picks up the next rifle

EXT - LOWER COURTYARD DAY

While Armageddon rages on the rampart Houdin continues his mysterious
work on the iron box in a state of almost trancelike concentration

CASLAVS ASSASSIN slides out of the shadows and creeps down the
Fortress stairs behind Houdin Houdin keeps working away Scimitar
drawn the Kabyle steals up behind closer and closer

EXT - COURTYARD DAY
Colette glances down to the lower courtyard She spots Houdins
attacker and instantly whips her rifle around She pulls the

trigger CLICK An empty chamber

COLETTE
Jean-Pierre Behind you
EXT - LOWER COURTYARD DAY

But her warning is too late The Assassin is already on Houdin
He raises his scimitar and swings down to slice Houdin in two

ANGLE ON

the scimitar swinging down -- then freezing in mid-air and SPARKING
madly as it hits a nearly invisible WIRE NETTING

ELECTRICITY flashes through the wire netting making its mesh
visible The voltage jolts through the blade into the Kabyles body

Houdin turns a voltage control dial to full The increased charge
kicks the Assassin three feet backwards onto his ass Houdin dials
down the voltage and grabs his stage vapler

Jumping to his feet Houdin ducks under the net and quickly stabs
the Assassin to death Immediately another Kabyle -- Huge --
rushes downstairs brandishing an even bigger scimitar

Houdin defends himself with an almost comical mincing fencing
academy style of swordplay

With one crude swing the Huge Kabyle slices Houdins blade in two
The Kabyle pauses and gloats wickedly Houdin looks heartbroken at
his beloved stage prop

HOUDIN
That was an antique

Houdin retreats and scoops up the dead Kabyles scimitar He resumes
his ultraformal fencing style - but this time it works He stabs
straight through his opponents heart The dead Kabyle slides down
the blade onto Houdin Houdin pushes the beast away with disgust
With no other visible danger at hand Houdin ducks under the wire
net spins the voltage dial and returns to his project

EXT - FORTRESS GATES DAY

Zoras waits protected by three bodyguards The heavy iron gates
begin to creak open

EXT - LOWER COURTYARD DAY

Colette rushes down to Houdin concerned

COLETTE
Are you all right

INT - ROTUNDA DAY

Darcy bounds onto the Rotunda main floor and hurries past the Pit
of Spikes to the spot where five catacomb tunnels begin

TWENTY KABYLES arrive at the top of the stairway They spot Darcy
below and shout with glee

A few Kabyles shoot -- but their bullets careen wildly off the
curved stone walls

Darcy sets the Iron Box down and fishes a key from his shirt pocket
He winds the Box with the key as if winding a clock The Iron Box
Starts TICKING

Darcy then confounds his pursuers by running back up the stairs
Straight at them The Kabyles daggers and swords drawn close on
him hollering and whooping

Darcy stops a few stairs short of the chalk-marked trap stair and
yanks a tethered rope loose from its spike Gripping the rope he
STOMPS down on the step as hard as he can and

SWINGS OUT ON THE ROPE all the way across the Rotunda

A great RUMBLING begins behind the walls

Darcy lands safely at the mouth of a tunnel some 50 feet above the
Rotunda floor He ties off the rope to a stake

Back on the stairs the Kabyles look down in sudden fear

KABYLES POV

as the narrow stairs retract one by one in their upward cascade

The Kabyles panic and try to run back up the stairs Too late The
Cascade Effect overtakes them The stones slide out from under their

feet and the entire squad falls screaming into the Pit of Spikes

Darcy satisfied turns and runs down his escape tunnel

INT - A MAZE OF TUNNELS DAY -- FOLLOWING DARCY

Darcy hears the sound of MORE KABYLES APPROACHING He changes
course quickly down a series of side tunnels to an escape ladder
He climbs out of sight

Bad luck on this level MORE KABYLES RUNNING towards him He keeps
climbing

INT - CORRIDOR CONTINUOUS - STILL FOLLOWING DARCY

Darcy pulls up the ladder tosses it aside He runs on down the
tunnel around a corner and right into

ZORAS backed by three tough BODYGUARDS

Darcy doesnt hesitate He pulls his pistol on Zoras and aims point
blank But before he can pull the trigger one of the Bodyguards
CRACKS A BULLWHIP and yanks the gun right out of his hand

Darcy draws his saber -- then freezes as all three Bodyguards step
forward with raised scimitars

Zoras waves his protectors back He slowly unsheathes his own
gleaming sword He bows courteously to Darcy

Darcy attacks at once with animal fury taking Zoras by surprise

Zoras blocks the blows and fights back Hes far better than
Darcy expected Suddenly Darcy is on the defensive

Bartolote slings Rachid over his shoulder
The Defenders reach another four-way intersection Colette pulls a
tiny SMOKE BOMB from her decolletage She lights it off a lantern
and drops it just as the Kabyles appear behind them

passageways Superb a swordsman as Darcy is Zoras is better He

cuts a deep gash across Darcys thigh -- first blood

Zoras smirks enjoying the sport of killing Darcy smashes back
gets lucky and cuts Zoras across the face One Bodyguard
immediately moves in and shields Zoras from further attack

The smile drains from Zoras face This duel is no longer amusing
He steps back gestures to another Bodyguard

ZORAS
(in Berber)
Kill him

The BULLWHIP cracks yanking the sword out of Darcys right hand -
The Bodyguard lunges ferward stabbing at Darcys throat But
instead of dodging the blow Darcy blocks it with his left hand

To the Bodyguards astonishment his sword stabs into Darcys
gloved palm

Zoras is shocked but impressed Blocking a sword with a bare
hand This is something hes never seen before

DARCY
(in the glee of battle)
You like thac Zoras Legion magic

Darcy yanks his wooden hand sideways and jerks the sword from his
Opponents grasp

A Kabyle dives straight for Darcy grabs the sword ang Darcys hand

and kill them too

HOUDIN
(laughing)
You and your men will never leave
those gates Youre standing on your

Soon the story will spread over all
of North Africa of how you and your
weak warriors were vanquished by a

mere ten men -- and a woman
ZORAS
You will say no more
HOUDIN
They will laugh at the name of Zoras

a prophet By my magic this very
ground will shake like thunder beneath
your feet 1 prophesy that the unholy
walls of this fortress will tumble
down and crush you like an insect

Enraged Zoras shoves his sword blade up under Houdins chin
pinning him helpless up against the wall

And when shall this ‘prophecy’ be
fulfilled
