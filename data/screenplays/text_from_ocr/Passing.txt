PASSING

Written by

Rebecca Hall

Based on the Novella by Nella Larsen
EXT NEW YORK UPPER EAST SIDE AUGUST 1927

Unnatural quiet given that we find ourselves in a busy
shopping street in a well-to-do part of town It is
unreasonably hot and too bright to see anything clearly

Dissolve to Light flaring in a static frame As the focus
sharpens we see feet walking As many feet as we can get
flare in and out of focus fading away to a white then
reforming as the honking of car horns and footsteps on the
pavement builds to a realistic volume

Eventually we focus on two pairs of female feet marching
purposefully

WOMAN 1
It’s like the whole city is out
today

WOMAN 2

Summer sales

WOMAN 1
That’s right

WOMAN 2
You can’t keep a New Yorker away
from a bargain

WOMAN 1
Ain’t that the truth

We follow them for a while eventually panning up to their
well hatted heads

WOMAN 1 (CONT’D)
Let’s get to the toy store and out
of this heat I’1l never hear the
end of it if I don’t get my niece a
doll for her birthday

WOMAN 2
Is she asking for a special sort
You know they have those ones with
the darling hair that you can

braid

WOMAN 1
Oh maybe she’1l like that I don’t
know

As they

INTEXT TOYSHOP

-Enter a Toyshop The toyshop is packed with merchandise
spilling into all corners leaving little space for the
customers of which there are already too many to accommodate

WOMAN 2
There now that’s better

An ATTENDANT holding a large pile of wooden airplanes fights
his way through the crowd as the women browse the doll
section We stay on their backs

WOMAN 2 (CONTD)
Look at that precious little
pickaninny one That she’1l love

WOMAN 1
No

WOMAN 2
Mm Of course she never even met a
colored that didn’t work for us
Thank Heavens

WOMAN 1 ruffles through a bucket of dolls and picks out a
‘Golliwog’ as the ATTENDANT comes towards them still carrying
the planes for the window display

ATTENDANT (0S)
Excuse me

The shop ATTENDANT teeters causing a calamity as everything
falls to the floor

WOMAN 1 drops the ‘Golliwog’ in order to help the ATTENDANT
ATTENDANT (CONT’D)
Never you mind ladies Accidents

will happen

He heads towards the register to deal with the line of
impatient shoppers

In the general commotion an UNKNOWN WOMAN picks up the doll

WOMAN 1
Oh dear

The UNKNOWN WOMAN holds the doll out to the women

UNKNOWN WOMAN
Here
We see the women’s faces looking closely at the unknown
woman IRENE REDFIELD (30s) She turns away nervous as they
take the doll from her

WOMAN 1
Thank you

IRENE walks away

WOMAN 1 (CONTD)
What a nice lady

INT TOYSHOP MOMENTS LATER
IRENE stands in line behind a TALL BLONDE MAN

For the first time we see her face underneath her cloche hat -
dark and furtive IRENE is not necessarily extraordinary
looking but definitely different to those in line with her
Her eyes Her mouth Her hair She’s difficult to place and
therefore people rarely do

The TALL BLONDE MAN finishes paying and leaves

IRENE sets down two toy cars on the counter Her hand is
shaking a little and throughout this exchange she tries to
avoid eye contact with the ATTENDANT

IRENE
Do you have the ‘Mother Goose
Tracing and Drawing Book’

ATTENDANT
All Sold Out

IRENE
Figures Ive tried all over town
My son won’t settle for anything
but

ATTENDANT
Try again in a couple weeks Might
get lucky

IRENE
His birthday’s tomorrow

He shrugs and finishes tying the string around her box
before passing it to her

ATTENDANT
Well better luck next time
EXT TOYSHOP THE SAME

IRENE scrambles out into the glaring sun Her bundles are
awkward to carry and she’s starting to fade under the heat

She looks towards a store on the other side of the street
fanning her perspiring face with a handkerchief

She takes two steps away from the curb and sees a MAN on the
other side of the street from her

HE LOOKS DEAD INTO HER EYES CLOSE IMPLORING THEN CLUTCHES
HIS CHEST AND STUMBLES

A couple passing by moves toward him and catches him

The glare is strong in IRENE’S eyes as she tries to focus on
THE MAN

THE MAN is lying in the street and a gaggle of people are
forming around him

IRENE also faint hails a cab

INT TAXI
IRENE settles into her seat

In the rear view mirror the also perspiring CABBIE’s eyes
look concerned

CABBIE
This heat Feel like I’m about to
pass out myself

IRENE
Yes I guess it’s tea I need I’m
a little faint

CABBIE
The Drayton ma’am They do say as
how there’s always a breeze up
there

IRENE
The Drayton’1l be lovely

Through the back window driving away she watches THE MAN’s
motionless body lying on the ground His grey anonymous face
obviously dead from a sudden heart attack
EXT HOTEL
IRENE gets out of the cab and looks at the hotel It is an
impressive period building Well to do white people drift in
through the revolving doors Suddenly everything looks
crisper and cleaner
INT HOTEL
IRENE walks a quiet hall towards the tea room
Everything here looks crisp and in focus A cool eerily
quiet and strangely remote oasis
INT HOTEL TEA ROOM
IRENE stands in the doorway of the empty tea room A SERVER
bobs into IRENE’s view signaling ‘one’ - she follows him to
a table and sits
SERVER
The waiter will be right with you

INT HOTEL TEA ROOM LATER

IRENE powders her forehead and checks her face in a compact
mirror

She looks around the room It is unusually silent A PAIR OF
ELDERLY WOMEN and A YOUNG MAN AND WOMAN IN LOVE The ice
cubes tinkle and the breeze carries the muffled conversations
past her

One such conversation drifts into Irene’s earshot

She hears the mumbles of a baritone voiced MAN and a light
HUSKY VOICED WOMAN behind her

Their conversation escalates in volume as they walk past her
table and sit at a table a little ways in front

The HUSKY VOICED WOMAN is obscured from view by the MAN
standing with his back to us

IRENE catches a glimpse of her legs crossing under the table
the extravagant chiffon of her dress as it blows around them

MAN
(barely audible)
See you later then
HUSKY VOICED WOMAN
(barely audible)
I should hope so

IRENE sees fragments of golden hair as the MAN leans down to
kiss the HUSKY VOICED WOMAN’s cheek before turning around
adjusting his tie and walking back the way he came briefly
making eye contact with IRENE on his way

IRENE looks away nervous to be caught staring She looks up
in the other direction

POV of the LOVED UP COUPLE clasping hands
POV ELDERLY WOMEN sipping tea in silence

HUSKY VOICED WOMAN (0S) (CONT’D)
Tea Thank you

The waiter brushes past IRENE again she looks down Then up
again careful not to look in the direction of the HUSKY
VOICED WOMAN

THE LOVED UP COUPLE

THE ELDERLY WOMEN

AND THEN SUDDENLY

A PAIR OF DARK EYES ARE STARING DIRECTLY BACK AT HER

They are those of the HUSKY VOICED WOMAN

We see her properly as she stares unapologetically at Irene
She is extraordinary looking - Fine golden hair strong
features beautifully shaped mouth precisely painted a bright
geranium red and big dark almost black eyes

IRENE LOOKS AWAY CAUGHT

IRENE DARES TO LOOK AGAIN aping confidence So what if she
looks She can’t possibly know

THE HUSKY VOICED WOMAN keeps staring She is neither hostile
nor smug - but something close to both She stands up and
starts to walk towards her

Time to leave IRENE turns to ask the waiter for the check
She turns back around to get money out of her purse only to
be greeted by the woman now standing by her table

HUSKY VOICED WOMAN (CONT’D)
Pardon me I don’t mean to stare
but I think I know you
IRENE returns her smile and makes to leave

IRENE
I’m afraid you are mistaken

HUSKY VOICED WOMAN
No no why of course I know you
‘Rene

IRENE is taken aback

HUSKY VOICED WOMAN (CONT’D)
You look just the same Tell me do
they still call you ‘Rene

IRENE
Yes though nobody’s called me that
for a long time

HUSKY VOICED WOMAN
Don’t you know me Not really
‘Rene

IRENE
I’m afraid I can’t seem to place

A spark of recognition THE HUSKY VOICED WOMAN nods excitedly
and breaks into a laugh - crisp like a bell

IRENE hand to mouth sits down in shock
IRENE (CONT’D)
(covertly)

Clare

CLARE
That’s right

IRENE
Not really Clare Kendry

CLARE sits
CLARE
Now don’t run away You simply must
stay and talk Fancy meeting you
here It’s simply too lucky

IRENE
It’s awfully surprising yes

Pause They look at one another knowingly

CLARE laughs again
IRENE (CONT’D)
Id never in this world have known
you if you hadn’t laughed You’ve
changed so

CLARE
Well it’s been twelve years at
least

She stares at IRENE

CLARE (CONTD)
You know I almost dropped by your
father’s house not so long ago-
I’ve thought of you so often

IRENE
You have

CLARE
Of course

CLARE smiles

CLARE (CONTD)
You know since I’ve been here I’ve
hoped I might run into someone
Preferably you though And now
youre here

She goes to grasp IRENE’s hand on the table stops as IRENE
withdraws her hand slightly Just slightly CLARE lights a
cigarette

CLARE (CONT’D)
Ill wager you’ve never given me a
thought So tell me I want to know
everything Married Children

IRENE
Yes Two boys You

CLARE
Mmm one girl Margery - she’s my
angel My husband John is here on
business Banking business - in
this heat Can you imagine

IRENE
That was your husband

Clare almost nods Pause
CLARE
We’ve been here a whole week from
Chicago That’s home Although I
come here and remember what home
really is

She smokes

PAUSE

CLARE (CONT’D)
Well - we can see lots of one
another these days that I am here
can’t we

IRENE
I don’t know I mean - I’m just - I
live in Harlem still I don’t come
to this part of town a whole lot

CLARE
Oh That’s sad -

CLARE (CONTD)
- Perhaps I can come visit with you
another time in Harlem Meet your
boys We’re often here - and if
things go well with this trip
John’s quite sure we’ll move It’s
my dream to come back ‘Rene

There is something desperate in CLARE’s expression that
touches IRENE despite herself

IRENE
I’m sure

CLARE snaps out of the brief melancholy with a wide smile

IRENE (CONT’D)
(cautious )
Clare does he

CLARE
Know -

She coyly shakes her head

CLARE (CONT’D)
Let’s go up to my suite where we
can talk properly

With complete authority -

CLARE (CONT’D)
Waiter

INT CLARE’S HOTEL SUITE LATER

The women enter an elegant if somewhat immodest room CLARE
heads to the back where the bed is behind a screen

CLARE
I can’t bear this heat I have to
change

IRENE hovers at the door still holding her bags and observes
the flurry of fine things scattered around the suite

CLARE (0S) (CONT’D)
John’1ll be back soon and here I am
sweating up a storm

IRENE
(bluntly)
That’s nice

CLARE (0S)
You know I found Gert Johnson in
the phone book - well Gertrude
Martin now She married Fred
Remember

IRENE
Yes - I haven’t seen Fred for an
unmentionable time

CLARE changes her dress partially obscured by the screen

CLARE
They have twins Isn’t that
wonderful Boys I’d love to have
boys

CLARE emerges trying to do up a button in back

CLARE (CONT’D)
Id never risk it again though -
never I went through hell those
nine months for fear Margery might
come out dark

IRENE looks behind her at the exit unable to move - but
desperate to

IRENE
Mine are “dark”

CLARE
And your husband He
IRENE
He couldn’t exactly ‘pass’ if

that’s what you mean

CLARE
Oh I thought you -

CLARE laughs loudly

CLARE (CONTD)
- Well then Would you

She stands in front of IRENE with open button

CLARE (CONTD)
Would you

IRENE puts down her bags and does up the button on the back
of her dress

CLARE grabs a nail polish and sits down to fix a chip

CLARE (CONTD)
Anyway - she goes as white

She faces IRENE

CLARE (CONTD)
So you haven’t ever thought to

IRENE
What

CLARE
I’m asking if you’ve ever thought
of passing

IRENE
No Why should I

CLARE shoots her a disdainful look
IRENE (CONT’D)
I mean for convenience -

occasionally I suppose But no

CLARE continues to stare
IRENE (CONT’D)
I just mean why would I I have
everything I ever wanted Except
perhaps a little more money

CLARE
Of course That’s all everybody
wants - a little more money Money

is an awfully nice thing to have
In fact all things considered I
think it’s entirely worth the
price

Pause

IRENE
I should go Clare I am not sure
it’s such a good idea if John comes
back

CLARE stands desperate to keep IRENE from leaving

CLARE
No ‘Rene - please It is You must
stay a little while longer Please
say youll stay

IRENE is touched but reticent

CLARE (CONTD)
(noticing her nails)

Oh hang it I made a mess Give me

a second and I’1ll order some food

up here huh

IRENE sits as if hypnotized by the nail business

IRENE
Alright

CLARE blows the nail polish dry
CLARE

What you thinking ‘Rene You’re
curious is that it

IRENE
Yes
CLARE
I don’t mind you can ask me

anything Anything you want

Sternly

IRENE
What have you told him about
your family

CLARE
You know I haven’t had to worry
about it as much as you’d think
There were my Aunts you see who
took me in after father died and
gave me a home of sorts Very
white Very respectable Very
religious I met John not long
after and as soon as I turned
eighteen and legal we got married
and well went off and left for
good

Incredulous

IRENE
And - you’re happy

CLARE
Of course ‘Rene As you say I have
everything I ever wanted

Shamed

IRENE
Sorry Clare - That was rude of me
Of course you’re happy Look at
you And your daughter -

CLARE
Margery She’s divine John wants
to put her in one of those Swiss
boarding schools this fall I dare
say it’1ll give her quite the
education Not anything like we had

-
CLARE picks up the phone still blowing her nail polish dry

CLARE (CONTD)
Hello - room service We want
cakes The most beautiful cakes you

have and tell me what kind of
tea you got passes for French
champagne

(beat)

Oh I’m messing

She pulls a hip flask from a drawer and shakes it
provocatively

CLARE (CONTD)
Well take a pitcher of iced tea -
in champagne flutes - we’re
celebrating

IRENE smiles CLARE’s joy is infectious

INT CLARE’S HOTEL SUITE LATER

A tray of beautiful cakes are on the table CLARE pours more
liquor from the flask into IRENE’s glass and passes it to
her She has finally removed her coat but her hat stays on

IRENE
That’s enough thank you
CLARE
Oh have a drop more youve hardly

had any

The door opens with a BANG and from behind IRENE JOHN BELLEW
enters Confident entitled charismatic His manner is
relentlessly jovial and easy - even in moments of extreme
cruelty

JOHN
Nig Come here and -

IRENE gulps swallows gasps or none of the above - but the
effect is the same

CLARE
- John dear

CLARE knows the kind of mood JOHN is in and interrupts him
quickly

CLARE (CONT’D)
I ran into an old old friend of
mine from school Irene Westover
Irene this is my husband John
Bellew

IRENE and JOHN shake hands Lucky for IRENE he’s far more
interested in his wife who he expected to find alone

JOHN
Oh A pleasure to meet you Mrs
Westover —

IRENE

Actually it’s Mrs Redfield

CLARE
Of course I didn’t even ask -

JOHN grabs a cake

JOHN
Well - I’m sorry if I’ve
interrupted Will you get me a
drink honey

CLARE
Well here

She passes him her glass

JOHN
Thank you What do you say then To
old friends

They toast ‘To old friends’ etc

JOHN loosens his tie a little examining IRENE properly for
the first time She looks away

He clocks the champagne flutes

JOHN (CONT’D)
Cute

He grabs another cake Displacing his desire for his wife
with desire for cakes

CLARE
You hear what John called me ‘Rene

JOHN chuckles and waves it away dismissive

JOHN
Oh Clare please

There is a knock at the door CLARE runs to open it

CLARE
Go on - tell her why

JOHN
It’s silly really but when we
were first married this woman was
white - white as a lily

Behind IRENE a ROOM SERVICE MAN A DARK SKINNED BLACK MAN IN
HIS LATE TEENS talks inaudibly to CLARE - she tells him to
clean the pitcher empty the ashtray and bring up a fresh
glass etc

JOHN (CONTD)
But as the years go by she seems to
be getting darker and darker -
- So I told her if you don’t look
out you’ll wake up one morning and
find you’ve turned into a nigger

He roars with laughter Another cake

JOHN (CONTD)
- She’s been ‘Nig’ ever since

CLARE joins the laughter affectionately batting him

IRENE stares in shock concentrating hard on THE ROOM SERVICE
MAN going about his business in silence She is not sure if
she’s going to scream or cry in fury

THE ROOM SERVICE MAN shuts the door behind him and suddenly
and unexpectedly IRENE explodes into gales of hysterical
laughter

IRENE
That’s good

IRENE continues to laugh

JOHN
Well it’s silly

CLARE and JOHN have stopped

IRENE
No that’s that’s that’s good

IRENE catchers CLARE glaring at her and manages to pull
herself together

CLARE
My goodness John After all these
years what would it matter if you
found out that I was one or two
percent colored

He pulls her towards him kissing her throughout

JOHN
You can turn as black as you please
as far as I’m concerned - I know

you’re not colored

There is an awkward silence awkward for so many reasons not
least because of the lecherous show of affection towards his
wife that follows this speech Then

IRENE
So you dislike Negroes Mr Bellew

JOHN

Oh no nothing like that at all
IRENE

Oh
JOHN

I hate them But not as much as Nig
does - for all she’s trying to turn
into one She won’t have them near
her not even as a maid Isn’t that
true

The whites of IRENE’s knuckles show Her lips compress

IRENE
Have you ever known any Negroes

CLARE throws her a sharp look JOHN turns serious

Silence

Pause

JOHN
No no but I do know people who
know them And I read about them in
the papers of course Terrible
mess Robbing killing It’s sad
really

CLARE
John dear I’m sure ‘Rene doesn’t
need to hear your pet perversions

JOHN
Youre right I’m sorry Didn’t
mean to bore you Mrs Redfield

JOHN (CONTD)
You live near Mrs Redfield

IRENE
Fairly

JOHN
Great city New York City of the
future What’s your husband’s line
of work

IRENE
He’s a Doctor

JOHN
Interesting life a Doctor’s

IRENE
Yes Hard Nerve wracking too

Flirtatious
JOHN

Wife’s nerves too eh - All those
lady patients

He laughs
CLARE
John dear don’t start More tea
‘Rene
IRENE
I’ve taken up too much of your time
already

She stands They stand

CLARE
But we’re just getting started

IRENE
Thank you for the drink Clare

JOHN
Ill see you out

They walk to the door JOHN opens it for her IRENE stands in
the doorway looking at the two of them

CLARE
‘Rene I do hope Ill see you
soon

JOHN

Good-bye Mrs Redfield Glad to
have met you

IRENE
Good-bye Clare

He closes the door on her IRENE stands in the corridor
Finally she takes a breath

EXT REDFIELD HOUSE STREET A SUMMER EVENING

At peace at last in her environment IRENE walks slowly up a
beautiful tree lined residential block A single shot
tracking with her The day is winding down The street is
becoming quiet House lights start to turn on as she walks
past

A neighbor walks up the stoop to his house He tips his hat

IRENE
‘Evening Lance

A window opens and the sounds of someone practicing a trumpet
floats out

She reaches her house and walks up the stoop to the front
door

INT REDFIELD HOUSE HALL LIVING ROOM THE SAME

IRENE drops her bags on the floor and looks in the living
room

The house is simple A staircase hits the entrance to the
front door with a living room to the left and a dining room
to the right The kitchen is out back with a modest backyard
and porch The hallway has a hat stand a mirror and a table
with the one telephone in the house

In the living room BRIAN REDFIELD is fast asleep in an
armchair He is dressed in a smart suit but his shoes are
unlaced - as if he fell asleep in the act of untying them

Upstairs can be heard the frenzied thuds of children playing

IRENE kneels by BRIAN’s feet and starts to take his shoes
off He stirs

BRIAN
Where you been

IRENE
Looking for that darn book They
eaten

BRIAN
Think so Yes I was gonna put them
to bed -

IRENE

But you fell asleep

BRIAN
Apparently
She kisses him deeply

BRIAN (CONT’D)
Am I still sleeping

BRIAN pulls her into his lap

FADE TO

EXT REDFIELD HOUSE THE STREET EARLY MORNING

It is now Autumn The calm before the day begins

Eventually the front door bursts open and BRIAN and his two
children JUNIOR and TED run out onto the sidewalk thick with
autumn leaves

JUNIOR is in stature and coloring much like his father
TED (nearly 12) also dark like his father his manner is far
more internal and contemplative than his brother JUNIOR
tosses a football at TED

JUNIOR
Catch it

TED doesn’t and instead halfheartedly kicks the ball back to
his brother

JUNIOR (CONTD)
Pass Pass

Brian smiles at him A trace of concern for his fragile
offspring

INT REDFIELD HOUSE IRENE AND BRIAN’S BEDROOM THE SAME
IRENE watches her children play out the window

The bedroom is homey but a mess Clothes are strewn
everywhere the bed is unmade there are toys scattered The
signs of a busy family life

As usual she is late for the day

INTEXT REDFIELD HOUSE

From the window she can hear and see them

BRIAN
Ted Come here

TED

BRIAN
(teasing)
I thought you nailed this already

TED
(shyly but teasing back)
I get confused
He ties his son’s laces
BRIAN
Go on now go play with your
brother We gotta leave in 5
minutes
We glimpse hear him disappearing into the house

INT REDFIELD HOUSE IRENE AND BRIAN’S BEDROOM THE SAME

IRENE goes to the closet to fetch stockings As she puts them
on she notices a ladder

IRENE
Damn

BRIAN creeps up on her from behind

BRIAN
Caught

IRENE
Damn it Brian you scared me Why
you gotta always be creepin’ round
the place like that

BRIAN
The profanity miss

He kisses her neck She shoos him away a little too quickly
BRIAN fixes his tie in the mirror

BRIAN (CONT’D)
They’re gonna be late for school

The sounds of the boys draw IRENE’s attention and she stares
out the window thoughtful

BRIAN (CONT’D)
And I wont make it downtown for my
next call if I have to drop you

She’s not listening

BRIAN (CONT’D)
Irene

IRENE
Sorry honey

She snaps into gear grabbing new stockings and putting them
on

IRENE (CONT’D)
I was just thinking how much Junior
is getting like you

BRIAN decides to change his tie

IRENE (CONTD)
I wonder if he isn’t going too fast
- in school It’s easy to forget
he’s younger -

BRIAN
I do wish you wouldn’t be ever
fretting about those boys They are
fine Perfectly good strong
healthy boys

IRENE admires how handsome her husband is

IRENE
I suppose I’m just afraid he’s
picked up some queer ideas about
things - from the older boys

BRIAN
‘Queer’ - what about

IRENE
You know ‘things’ young boys be
thinking about

BRIAN
You mean about sex

IRENE
Yes - jokes Things like that

BRIAN
If sex isn’t a joke what is it
And what is a joke

IRENE
Don’t be facetious

BRIAN
You ready

She is still in her robe

IRENE
You go I’1l take the bus

He’s familiar with this routine

BRIAN
I’1l pick you up then

IRENE
Please From the printing office I
need to see about more handbills
and tickets for the dance

BRIAN
They ought to be paying you

She brushes down his jacket
IRENE
It’s not charity work if they pay

me for it

He kisses her She ends it a little fast

INT REDFIELD HOUSE HALL MIDDLE ROOM MOMENTS LATER

Their maid ZULENA a small dark skinned black woman helps
JUNIOR and TED into their coats BRIAN puts on his hat IRENE
sits on the stairs smiling at them

BRIAN
(to the boys)
Are we ready

IRENE
Alright now - lickety split

JUNIOR
Can’t catch me

ZULENA
Come back

BRIAN
(to Ted)
Are you ready

TED
I don’t wanna go

BRIAN
You have to I’m afraid

They dart out the door BRIAN tips his hat at IRENE on the
way out ZULENA heads back to the kitchen

JUNIOR (0S)
Bye mama

Quiet IRENE goes to collect the mail off the hall table She
shuffles through the letters pausing on one with ORNATE
FLOWERY HANDWRITING addressed from CLARE BELLEW

She places that letter back on to the table absentmindedly
and heads down the stairs

INT REDFIELD HOUSE DINING ROOM THE SAME

IRENE settles into a seat Around her is the wake of the
family breakfast She has no intention of cleaning it up

ZULENA comes in with the pot and pours her some

ZULENA
You want grapefruit ma’am

IRENE
(reading a letter)
Uh-huh Thank you

IRENE divides the post into organized piles One for bills
another with envelopes marked ‘Negro Welfare League’ The
action is methodical and slow So precise as to be obsessive

INT REDFIELD HOUSE HALL MIDDLE ROOM LATER
IRENE now ready to go out puts on her coat in front of the

hall mirror ZULENA is dusting the hall Irene realizes she
has left her hat upstairs and goes to retrieve it

As she goes ZULENA spots the flowery letter on the table and
hands it to IRENE

ZULENA
Mrs Redfield you forgot one

IRENE
Thank you

IRENE takes the letter and continues up the stairs

EXT PRINTING OFFICE STREET

BRIAN waits in the car for IRENE as IRENE walks towards the
car counting the Tickets in her bundle

IRENE
(getting in)
You want me to drive

BRIAN
Sure

We stay looking at the inside of the car as they swap seats

INT CAR THE SAME

They drive We see them in the car and very little out the
small back window behind them

BRIAN
Everything set

IRENE
Uh-huh - we’re a month away and all
the bookings are gone - not
counting the door

They stop behind a car In front of the car is a dump truck
with a guy collecting garbage cans from the street

BRIAN rolls down a window

BRIAN
I’m as busy as a cat with fleas
myself

IRENE

Aint you cold
BRIAN rolls up the window

IRENE (CONT’D)
No Leave it If you’re not cold
BRIAN stares at the garbage man hauling the trash

BRIAN
This city

IRENE
Bad today huh

BRIAN
Bad Yes bad All of it Really
Irene I’m beginning to hate sick
people Their stupid meddling
families smelly dirty rooms -- I
can’t I swear This city -

IRENE
Come on now It’s just a bad day -
you don’t mean that You’re helping
those sick people

The car moves

BRIAN
Let’s not talk about it

IRENE
You brought it up

Pause

IRENE (CONT’D)
Put the window down would you

BRIAN
Thought you said you were cold

IRENE
Well now I’m saying I can’t
breathe Put the window down

He does The car stops again

IRENE (CONT’D)
I know you think trying somewhere
else would be easier for us - South
America or some such And to a
point I agree We should go -
abroad somewhere

BRIAN looks up
IRENE (CONT’D)
Not for a while of course but when
the boys leave - We could visit
Brazil

BRIAN
Visit

IRENE
Or maybe - I was thinking one of
them European schools for Junior

The car moves

BRIAN
Youre going to make a mollycoddle
out of that boy Ted is the one who
needs your attention not Junior
You needn’t think I’m going to let
you change Junior to some nice
kindergarten school coz he’s
getting a little necessary
education

IRENE
I wasn’t —-

BRIAN
- coz the sooner he learns about
sex the better Certainly if he
learns it’s a grand joke the
greatest in the world

IRENE feels the slight of this on her She loves him
they haven’t Don’t so much anymore

IRENE
What’s that supposed to mean

The car stops

BRIAN
Nothing

He gives up
BRIAN (CONT’D)
I’m just getting a little tired of
playing second fiddle to your
precious Negro League that’s all

He playfully pushes her dress up over her leg

but

BRIAN (CONT’D)
How ‘bout a little charity for this

Negro

IRENE
Come on now - there’s people
looking

She pushes his hand away BRIAN looks out the window and
happens to catch eyes with a lady waiting on the sidewalk

The lady looks at them in the car as they move past - the
idyllic picture of the respectable middle class couple in
their automobile He tips his hat

INT REDFIELD HOUSE IRENE AND BRIAN’S BEDROOM NIGHT

IRENE is sitting up in bed reading a magazine BRIAN enters
taking off his robe and slippers He picks up a letter from
the dresser

BRIAN
What’s this

IRENE
I think it’s from Clare Bellew

BRIAN
Clare Bellew That the woman from
Chicago you told me about running
into

IRENE nods and turns out her lamp settling down to sleep

BRIAN (CONT’D)
You gonna see her again

IRENE
I haven’t opened the letter

BRIAN
It’s postmarked New York

IRENE
I know

BRIAN
Maybe they moved

IRENE
Brian I’m not going to see her

BRIAN
Thought you said you two were good
friends in school

IRENE
Brian darling I would have to be
an idiot not to realize that if a
man calls me a ‘you know what’
it’s his fault the first time but
mine if I give him the opportunity
to do it again

BRIAN
Sure sure May I

She shrugs Closes her eyes and rolls over He opens the
letter Nonplussed

IRENE rolls back over to face him cross He tries to contain
himself

BRIAN (CONTD)
(reading)
“T am so lonely so lonely
cannot help longing to be with you
again”

IRENE
Don’t mock her That’s not fair

BRIAN
I’m just reading it

IRENE
Fine

BRIAN
“You can’t know how in this pale
life of mine I am all the time
seeing the bright pictures of that
other that I once thought I was
glad to be free of”

He giggles again IRENE rolls back over trying to ignore him

BRIAN (CONT’D)
Cmon it’s funny She’s very
dramatic “It may be ‘Rene dear
that your way may be the wiser and
infinitely happier one -

IRENE
- well I am flattered “Wiser” As
if anything could rectify the

humiliation -

BRIAN
Wait There’s more - “I wouldn’t
feel this wild desire if I hadn’t
seen you” -

BRIAN tosses the letter on the table and rolls towards IRENE

BRIAN (CONTD)
That’s rich - blaming you “Wild
desire” (whistles) Don’t give her
an inch

He turns out his light Snuggles down

BRIAN (CONT’D)
What you so angry for anyhow The
husband didn’t call YoU a -

IRENE
- No but he would have It amounts
to the same thing

BRIAN
It has you will admit its
humorous side

She sits up abruptly turning back on her light

IRENE
No - I won’t It’s not funny at
all It’s revolting

BRIAN yawns

BRIAN
Irene leave it It’s normal They
always come back

IRENE
Why They have to work so hard
getting there Why would they want
to come back

BRIAN
(falling asleep)
If I knew that I’d know what race
is

Disdainfully
You’

IRENE
d think they’d be satisfied

‘being white’

Rot

BRIAN
Who’s satisfied being

anything

IRENE turns of

f her light Settles down

IRENE
I am

BRIAN
Hmm

IRENE

Satisfied I am

for a moment as she realizes there are no

EXT REDFIELD

HOUSE STREET THAT AFTERNOON

IRENE walks the block and up her stoop with bags of groceries
to the sound of the boy practicing his trumpet - now a little
more accomplished

INT REDFIELD HOUSE HALL

IRENE walks through the hall and down the stairs

INT REDFIELD HOUSE KITCHEN
IRENE places the bag on the counter for ZULENA to unpack
IRENE
I got yams for tonight Save the

chicken for tomorrow

ZULENA
Yes ma’am

IRENE
Did you clean the boys’ room
already

ZULENA
Not yet

IRENE
Well hurry - they’1ll be back soon
and then it’1l be impossible
IRENE stands there watching ZULENA unpack She has an
instinct to help her but resists it in order to treat her
servant in the ‘proper way’

ZULENA
Can I get you something

IRENE
No I can get it

She pours herself a drink ZULENA carries on acutely aware
of her presence
INT REDFIELD HOUSE FRONT ROOM LATER

IRENE naps in an armchair a book lying open in her lap
THUMPING from the playroom above wakes her up

IRENE looks at the clock 4pm - It chimes

The phone starts ringing over the clock

INT REDFIELD HOUSE HALL

ZULENA picks up the phone

ZULENA
Redfield residence
(beat)
Yes hello

IRENE takes the call from ZULENA

ZULENA (CONT’D)
It’s Mr Wentworth

ZULENA walks back down to the kitchen
IRENE
Hello Yes Hugh oh quite -
and you Every single one Honest
I know wait - I’1ll give mine to
Bianca I won’t need it anyway

The doorbell rings ZULENA walks back through to open it

IRENE (CONT’D)

No I mean it Was silly of me
not to in the first place Ill be
so busy -

IRENE turns around to face the door
Silhouetted in the door is CLARE

IRENE waves to ZULENA to show her into the living room Then
turns back partially facing the wall

IRENE (CONT’D)

Mmm well as long as Brian has a
place to drop down now and then -
uh-huh -

She traces her finger along the wood of the table stiff and
deliberate

IRENE (CONT’D)
- that’s nice My love to Bianca
Yes Ill see to it right away See
you tomorrow Hugh Bye

IRENE hangs up the phone and checks herself in the mirror

INT REDFIELD HOUSE LIVING ROOM CONT

IRENE rounds the corner to the living room to see CLARE
resplendent in a fine day dress

IRENE
Dear god but aren’t you lovely
Clare

IRENE goes to greet her genuinely moved to see her in spite
of herself

CLARE turns away She seems hurt She sits down curling her
legs easily under her

CLARE
Didn’t you mean to answer my letter
‘Rene

IRENE stays silent

CLARE (CONT’D)
Every day I went to that nasty
little post office -I’m sure they
all thought I’d had some love-
affair and that the man had thrown
me over

IRENE
Oh Clare I -

She finally looks directly at IRENE

CLARE
Well - eventually it sunk in You
hadn’t written and didn’t intend
to

IRENE taken aback by the heightened drama in the room takes a
moment to put her feelings into perspective

CLARE (CONTD)
I tried very hard to forget about
it But I couldn’t I had to know
why So that’s why I came here

Pause

CLARE (CONTD)
Why didn’t you write to me ‘Rene

Irene takes a cigarette now observing CLARE rather than
running to put her out of her pain

IRENE
You see -

She takes a drag being careful to word everything with great
care and precision
IRENE (CONT’D)
Well you see - I can’t help
thinking that you ought not
ought not to come up here

CLARE
What you mean is you don’t want me
here

IRENE
No Just what I said You ought not
to run the risk It’s terribly
foolish - you must see that and
well - just not the right thing

CLARE laughs The air shifts

Snapping

CLARE
Oh ‘Rene You’re priceless ‘The
right thing’

IRENE
I mean it isn’t safe
CLARE
Safe
IRENE

To come up here - considering what
I saw of Mr Bellew’s attitude

CLARE
Of course I understand And I
don’t blame you for being angry
That said you behaved beautifully
that day Really beautifully -
thank you

IRENE
I don’t want thanks

CLARE
I just mean it was very kind of you
to be so delicate about it all

IRENE
What other option did I have
Clare I’ve been furious with you
Really furious - putting me in that
position

CLARE
Of course

CLARE wells up again

IRENE
And honestly I don’t see why you
can’t know that’s why I wouldn’t
write -

CLARE
- How foolish of me

IRENE
- Why I wouldn’t want anything to
do with you

CLARE starts to cry

IRENE (CONT’D)
Oh no now don’t cry

IRENE goes and hugs her The instinct to protect this woman
always wins

CLARE
I just feel so terrible about it
all I didn’t even think - how
could I I’m just so sorry ‘Rene

IRENE
There there - don’t be I’m sorry
too

She hands CLARE a hankie They smile at one another

IRENE (CONT’D)
Darn it but truth is - I’m very
glad to see you Clare Very

CLARE
And I you ‘Rene You can’t imagine -
without that day I might have gone
to the end unable to really speak
to anyone You can’t know - never
anyone to really talk to

IRENE
Of course It was very insensitive
of me not to think about that

CLARE
Oh I don’t expect you to
understand

She tries not to cry again

CLARE (CONTD)
Youre happy You have a true good
life - and you’re free Free - and
safe I don’t even know what that
is anymore

IRENE is incapacitated She stares at the ceiling towards the
inconsistent thumping of the children above her

IRENE
I’m beginning to believe that no
one is ever completely happy or
free or safe

CLARE collects herself Another emotional U-turn
CLARE
So then what does it matter if I
come up here sometimes
IRENE looks at her straight
IRENE
You have a child Clare It’s not
just a matter of your safety
The phone rings Eventually
CLARE
I think - that being a mother is
the cruelest thing in the world

IRENE thinks about how this statement disgusts her Her
perspective is back

IRENE
Yes - and the most responsible

Silence The thumping stops as abruptly as it started
ZULENA enters
ZULENA
Mr Wentworth is on the telephone

again ma’am

CLARE smiles at ZULENA to which she returns an unimpressed
nod

IRENE
‘Scuse me

INT REDFIELD HOUSE HALL LIVING ROOM THE SAME

IRENE watches CLARE move around the living room whilst
talking to HUGH on the phone

CLARE traces her finger gracefully around a photograph of
BRIAN and the boys The actions is invasive and a touch
sinister

IRENE
Hello Oh honestly Hugh - tell her
to stop being silly I’ve told you
it’s fine Ill see you tomorrow

INT REDFIELD HOUSE MIDDLE ROOM STAIRS THE SAME
IRENE re-enters as CLARE turns to face her

CLARE
You sound busy

IRENE
It’s this Negro Welfare League
Dance tomorrow I’m on the
organizational committee - am the
committee pretty much

CLARE
Hugh Wentworth the novelist

IRENE
Yes You know him

CLARE
I’ve read a book or two of his

IRENE
(surprised)
You have Good aren’t they

CLARE
I suppose - sort of contemptuous

IRENE
Yes Well he’s a dear really

She wishes CLARE would leave

IRENE (CONTD)
You don’t mind if I do some things
around the house I wasn’t
expecting guests

They start down the stairs

CLARE
I don’t mind You can show me your
home

INT REDFIELD HOUSE KITCHEN

The women enter the kitchen ZULENA is preparing yams A
stock is simmering on the stove

CLARE
So Hugh Wentworth is coming up here
to your dance

IRENE
Yes Why not

IRENE sniffs the stock and starts to exit CLARE following

INT REDFIELD HOUSE STAIRS HALL UPPER FLOOR LANDING

IRENE and CLARE climb the stairs up to the first floor

CLARE
Seems rather curious A man like
that going to a Negro dance

IRENE
Hundreds of white people like Hugh
come to affairs in Harlem now -

CLARE
Why

IRENE
Same reason you’re here to see
Negroes

They have reached the landing near the front door Still
CLARE does not leave IRENE shouts up the stairs

IRENE (CONT’D)
What you doing boys

No answer just thumps IRENE grabs a discarded sweater from
the bannister and a pair of shoes

IRENE (CONT’D)
- To enjoy themselves get
material

(MORE )

IRENE (CONTD)
gaze on the great and near great
while they gaze on the ‘Negroes’

CLARE
‘Rene suppose I come too

IRENE
Because so many white people go

IRENE starts up the next flight of stairs with CLARE in
pursuit

CLARE
No Because it will be fun

IRENE
I don’t know What if someone
recognizes you

CLARE
I’1l take my chances on getting by

IRENE
You will be bored stiff

CLARE
I won’t honestly I won’t

INT REDFIELD HOUSE IRENE AND BRIANS BEDROOM THE SAME

IRENE moves into her bedroom to put her sweater and shoes
away She grabs some other stray items off of the bed CLARE
stays in the doorway There is a wide open window with gauzy
curtains blowing in the wind

IRENE
(as to a child)
I won’t be able to look after you

CLARE
I’1l be good as gold Just sit and
gaze on the great and near great

IRENE realizes that she really does not want her to come
That in fact the thought of it is already making her anxious

IRENE
Look - I don’t care what you do or
where you go But I don’t see why
you should put yourself in a place
that might bring you trouble

She slams the dresser drawer shut with her hip

CLARE
Damn John He gets in the way of
everything I want I could kill
him

IRENE goes to close the window and notices a weed in one of
the pots in the window box She lifts the pot out in order to
get better purchase

IRENE
I wouldn’t There’s still capital

punishment - in this state at
least

CLARE walks into the room behind her settling against the
wall next to IRENE
CLARE

I want so much to be with Negroes

again to talk with them to hear

them laugh I’ve almost forgotten

it -
Something about the preposterousness of this sentiment and
CLARE’s proximity serves to unsettle IRENE enough to lose her
grip on the plant pot
WE HEAR A SMASH
BOTH WOMEN CRANE OUT THE WINDOW TO LOOK
WE SEE THE SMASHED POT ON THE GROUND BELOW

IRENE
Oh damn

CLARE
Shall I go down -

IRENE
No It’s nothing Zu will clean it
INT REDFIELD HOUSE UPPER FLOOR LANDING
IRENE moves to the landing CLARE follows
She shouts over the bannister

IRENE
Zu

No answer IRENE wipes her hands on her dress

IRENE (CONT’D)
Oh look - come to the dance if you
want to I’m not going to stop you

CLARE
Thank you ‘Rene You’re so kind
Really thank you
IRENE moves to the boys room and knocks on the door
IRENE
BoYs

INT REDFIELD HOUSE JUNIOR AND TED’S BEDROOM THE SAME

IRENE and CLARE stand in the doorway

JUNIOR
We’re busy What do you want

IRENE
Junior

CLARE instantly crouches down to their level

CLARE
Oh please don’t be cross I know
I’ve gone and spoiled everything
If I promise not to get too much in
the way will you let me in

TED turns his attention to her and JUNIOR is enchanted CLARE
moves into the room to play IRENE watches for a minute and
then backs out to deal with the pot downstairs

INT REDFIELD HOUSE KITCHEN A LITTLE LATER

IRENE talks to ZULENA who is cooking IRENE has pieces of
plant pot in her hand

IRENE
It’1l just be us for dinner

ZULENA
Just as well I don’t have anymore
for more

She goes back to attacking some vegetables
CLARE enters and goes to refill her water glass She’s

already more comfortable in this kitchen than IRENE ZU
remains suspicious
CLARE
Well They were the cowboys and I
was the Indian and they captured me
in front of the fort But I think I
just made my escape

JUNIOR (0S)
CLARE

IRENE
Pay no attention Junior gets ahead
of himself fast

CLARE walks further into the kitchen

CLARE
What’s cooking Yams How you
fixing them

ZULENA
Butter salt sugar Simple

CLARE
Simple Why it’s about the most
perfect taste on God’s earth

CLARE rejoins IRENE at the doorway
CLARE (CONT’D)
Where did you find her ‘Rene I
long for a maid who knows real home
cooking
IRENE
It’s not like that

INT REDFIELD HOUSE HALL MOMENTS LATER

IRENE and CLARE climb the stairs

CLARE
Not like what

IRENE
Everyone needs help It’s normal

IRENE hands CLARE her coat

IRENE (CONT’D)
Maybe next time you can stay for
dinner Hmm

CLARE
Oh please yes I can stop by here
tomorrow and we can go to the dance
together

IRENE
‘Alright

CLARE
See you tomorrow then

IRENE
Yes Tomorrow

CLARE
Bye ‘Rene

CLARE finally exits IRENE shuts the door behind her with

force and leans against it as if it might open again at any
moment

EXT REDFIELD HOUSE STREET TWILIGHT

TED and JUNIOR hopscotch on the sidewalk ZULENA opens the
door and beckons them in The trumpet is playing

ZULENA
Alright now boys c’mon in

INT REDFIELD HOUSE IRENE AND BRIAN’S BEDROOM THE FOLLOWING
LATE AFTERNOON

IRENE in her robe picks out three un-fussy dresses from her

closet and lays them on the bed She is not convinced by any
of them

INT REDFIELD HOUSE IRENE AND BRIAN’S BEDROOM EVENING

IRENE now sits in front of her dressing room mirror finishing
her make up in a negligee

BRIAN enters
BRIAN
Thought you might have fallen

asleep or something

IRENE
No About on time For once

BRIAN
Good

BRIAN sits on the bed

BRIAN (CONT’D)
You nervous

IRENE
Hey Get off You’re sitting on my
dress

He shifts smooths out the one dress left on the bed she has
picked out Surveys it He knows it is not her nicest

IRENE starts to do her eyebrows

IRENE (CONT’D)
Clare’s coming

BRIAN
Huh

IRENE
Clare Bellew

BRIAN
The crazy woman Clare

IRENE
Her yes her

BRIAN
Crazy woman Clare Bellew

IRENE
She’s not crazy

BRIAN
Since when

IRENE
Just - different

He raises more eyebrows if there were more eyebrows to raise
Starts to remove his tie

IRENE (CONT’D)
She surprised me with a visit
yesterday

BRIAN
Yesterday Why in the world didn’t
you tell me

IRENE
Dunno I’ve had a lot to think
about

BRIAN
Irene -

IRENE

She made it sound not such a
problem if she came with us - so I
said fine -

He unbuttons his shirt thoughtfully

BRIAN
She’s coming here

IRENE nods

IRENE
Any minute I would think Be nice
huh

BRIAN
I highly doubt it

IRENE
I mean you be nice to her

BRIAN
Ill be polite

He lets himself flop back on to the bed and lies there for a
moment staring at the ceiling

THERE IS A SMALL CRACK IN THE PLASTER

IRENE
You gonna dress or just lie there

BRIAN gets up He changes shirts quickly watching IRENE and
shaking his head He grabs a different tie then goes to check
himself over IRENE’s shoulder in the mirror

IRENE (CONT’D)
You done

BRIAN
IRENE

Quit hovering Go wait for me
downstairs

He grabs his jacket and heads to the door

IRENE (CONT’D)
Wait I’m sorry I love you

At the door

BRIAN
Boy You are nervous

INT REDFIELD HOUSE STAIRWAY LANDING THE SAME

BRIAN closes the door and bounds down the stairs putting on
his jacket in the process

INT REDFIELD HOUSE IRENE AND BRIAN’S BEDROOM LATER

IRENE stares at her hands as we see her reflection in the
dressing room mirror Her make up is simple and well applied
She is ready still and serene

The doorbell rings breaking her out of her reverie She
looks at herself in the mirror listening to the voices
drifting up from downstairs CLARE can be heard IRENE winces
almost imperceptibly at her reflection She stands up to
check her outfit

She smooths the creases in her gown and heads downstairs

INT REDFIELD HOUSE MIDDLE ROOM FRONT ROOM THE SAME

IRENE walks with mounting confidence down the stairs As the
voices from the living room become louder she stops for a
moment to listen

From the stair she can just make out the curve of a leg A
high heel - obscured by BRIAN - the play of shadow and light
makes it appear that BRIAN and CLARE are much closer to one
another

CLARE (0S)
I thought I’d die Truly I did I
had such a fever

BRIAN (0S)
It was close to an epidemic I
can’t recall how many cases I
treated last year Not all of them
made it You were lucky

IRENE watches a corner of CLARE’s arm as she reaches up to
finish a drink

She watches what looks like CLARE’s hand brushing past
BRIAN’s chest

Her neck arching back in laughter
BRIAN (CONT’D)
More on my watch got through than
others but I’m bragging
CLARE
So what if you are It’s worth

bragging about if it’s true

BRIAN
You may be right

IRENE moves forward

INT REDFIELD HOUSE FRONT ROOM CONT

IRENE comes in with energy

BRIAN and CLARE stand up to greet her Not so close to one
another after all

Now we see CLARE in her full glory She is exquisitely
dressed in a shining gown of black taffeta with her hair
pulled back into a small twist at the nape of her neck

IRENE is suddenly self-conscious about her choice of dress
especially now she sees how well CLARE compliments her
husband She does a good job of covering

IRENE
Gosh I’m sorry I had no idea you
were here already

CLARE
We made our own introductions

BRIAN
We did

CLARE
You look lovely ‘Rene

IRENE
I feel I may have chosen all wrong

CLARE
Rot It’s perfect

IRENE is flattered Softens a little

ZULENA comes in with the boys in their pajamas to say good
night

CLARE (CONTD)
Here they are
(to TED)
Howd I look

TED
Like a princess

BRIAN
Okay fella Bedtime

IRENE and BRIAN kiss the boys and hurry into the hall

INT REDFIELD HOUSE HALL THE SAME

ZULENA and the boys head upstairs as BRIAN IRENE and CLARE
get their coats on

BRIAN helps CLARE into hers

CLARE
You know I feel exactly as I used
to the night before Christmas I
knew there was a surprise for me
and couldn’t quite guess what it
was I’m so excited You can’t
possibly imagine

BRIAN smirks at IRENE behind CLARE’s back

BRIAN
You can’t possibly imagine

IRENE
(laughs)
Stop now

BRIAN puts on his hat

EXT TOWN HALL NIGHT

They walk alongside the long line of people waiting outside
the hall to get in

IRENE leads the gang to the front Whilst the people stare at
CLARE and she stares back

INT TOWN HALL THE SAME

The dance is in full swing People from all walks of life for
one night together The frame fills with dancing bodies -
Lindy Hopping frenetically A band plays somewhere obscured
by dancers A bandstand made up of a Baby Grand Piano double
bass Clarinet Drum Kit Two Trombones Two Trumpeters
Baritone Sax and Banjo

In one of the booths sits HUGH WENTWORTH a distinguished
white man in his 40s He is watching his wife BIANCA dance
with a handsome group of black men

HUGH
(shouting)
Bianca I’m outraged

IRENE BRIAN and CLARE make their way through the crowd to
the booths on the edge of the dance floor

IRENE
There’s Hugh

BRIAN
We got somewhere to sit

IRENE
That booth with Hugh - if we can
get there

CLARE

What a hoot

HUGH claps for his wife ostentatiously as the song finishes

INT TOWN HALL LATER

CLARE is pouring booze from her hip flask into soda bottles
under the table She passes them to HUGH and BRIAN

IRENE is standing a little in front of the booth surveying
the party

FELISE FREELAND and her husband DAVE dance past her eye-line
She waves at them

FELISE
It’s a triumph The band is peachy
DAVE
It’s a riot

CLARE stands and drags BRIAN into the throng
seated behind IRENE

CLARE
Come on Brian we’re going dancing

BRIAN
Oh no no no

CLARE
Oh yes yes yes

IRENE waves on her husband and CLARE
IRENE

Oh god look out Clare the man has
two left feet

HUGH stays

She laughs BRIAN is ‘being nice’ and it’s making her happy

At leastnot so anxious

CLARE
Is that true

BRIAN
No
(beat)
Yes it’s very true

IRENE looks at the people dancing ‘young men

old men white

men black men youthful women older women pink women

golden women fat men stout women’

She focuses a while on a particularly GOOD LOOKING AND ADEPT

DANCING COUPLE

Near them CLARE and BRIAN dance not nearly so well

IRENE
Rich man poor man beggar man
thief How the rest of it go

HUGH
Doctor lawyer Indian chief
Everybody seems to be here and a
few more

He watches CLARE

HUGH (CONTD)

What I am trying to find out is the
history status and of the blonde
beauty out of the fairy tale you
brought along The one currently
seen dancing with your husband

IRENE
She’s a girl from Chicago I used to
know She’s very excited I know
you

HUGH
Good of her I’m sure

HUGH searches for something

HUGH (CONTD)

Can you spot my wayward wife in the
throng

IRENE points -

BIANCA is seen being taught a dance by an enthusiastic group
of HARLEM LOCALS

HUGH (CONT’D)
Ah yes The usual problem - all
these er gentlemen of color have
driven a mere Nordic out of her
mind

IRENE
Stop

He pats his forehead with an elaborate handkerchief His
dress is altogether elegant if not a tad flamboyant

HUGH
Have I laid eyes on her tonight
except in spots here and there
being twirled about by some
‘Ethiopian’ I have not

HUGH often affects racist generalizations as ‘irony’ - IRENE
tolerates it It is a game they both play

IRENE
Well sir you’ve got to admit the
average colored man is a better
dancer than the average white That
is if the celebrities who find
their way up here are fair
specimens of your sort

HUGH
Having not tripped the light
fantastic with any of the males I
am hardly in a position to argue
the point

He rolls his eyes The music changes to something slower

HUGH (CONTD)
Bianca and Co are always raving on
about the good looks of some Negro -
especially an unusually dark one

RALPH HAZELTON very tall and impressive cuts in and steals
CLARE for a dance BRIAN relieved makes his escape

HUGH (CONT’D)
Like Ralph Hazelton there

RALPH and CLARE dance It’s not silly There is electricity
in their movements which become increasingly charged and
committed

HUGH (CONT’D)
Dozens of women have declared him
fantastically handsome What do you
think Is he

IRENE
No And I don’t think anyone else
would either Just plain exoticism
An interest in what’s different A
kind of emotional excitement - that
something you feel in the presence
of something strange and even
perhaps a bit repugnant to you

She is watching CLARE

HUGH
And there you have it

HUGH CLOCKS A SMALL GROUP OF WHITE MEN OGLING SOME DANCING
GIRLS

HUGH (CONT’D)
So you subscribe to the notion that
our motives for coming up here
are predatory

IRENE
No More curious I should say
HUGH
Like your princess from Chicago -

IRENE laughs knowingly Or maybe it’s an eyebrow raised
Either way HUGH notices

HUGH (CONTD)
Now what’s that supposed to mean

IRENE
Things aren’t always what they
seem Hugh

HUGH
What is she then if not a princess
from Chicago

The penny drops

HUGH (CONT’D)
I’1l be damned

IRENE
Nobody could tell from looking at
her

HUGH

No Most surprising
He watches her

HUGH (CONTD)
Tell me something - can you always
tell the difference

IRENE
Now you really are sounding
ignorant

HUGH
No I mean it Feelings of kinship
or something like that

IRENE
Stop talking to me like you’re
writing a piece for the National
Geographic I can tell the same as
you
But I suppose sometimes - it is a
thing a thing that can’t be
registered

HUGH
Yes I understand what you mean Yet
- lots of people pass all the time

IRENE
It’s easy for a Negro to pass for
white but I don’t think it would be
so simple for a white person to
pass for colored

HUGH
Never thought of that

IRENE
No Hugh Why would you

This lands on him

HUGH
Sometimes I think you could

IRENE
Yes

HUGH
And in a way if you can why
wouldn’t you

She’s offended

HUGH (CONTD)
I’m asking Why wouldn’t you

IRENE spots BRIAN making his way through the crowd with fresh
sodas

IRENE
(under her breath)
Who says I’m not

HUGH
Youre being unusually cryptic this
evening

IRENE

And you are being an ass I just
mean we’re all of us passing for
something or other aren’t we

He knows what she means

HUGH
An ass am I

CLARE approaches exhilarated from dancing

CLARE
Oh my feet hurt like a marathon
runner

CLARE flops into the booth

IRENE
I am in awe of your energy

HUGH
I suppose I ought to retrieve my
wife before some man or other
steals her away from me
indefinitely

CLARE
Won’t you dance with me Mr
Wentworth

Loaded

HUGH
It’s not my strong suit Mrs
Bellew

BRIAN crosses HUGH on the way out He sits down handing IRENE
a drink

CLARE
Your husband has ruined me ‘Rene -
I simply must have another dance
with him He’s the best here

Everyone knows this is a lie for BRIAN’s benefit

BRIAN
I suppose my wife hasn’t told you
that I don’t respond well to
flattery

BRIAN stands and kisses his wife on the cheek
BRIAN (CONT’D)
However I would be more than happy
to find you a suitable replacement
He goes to root out a friend
CLARE stands one knee resting on the edge of the seat She

sways gently watching the dancers Behind her IRENE sits
observing her

Something about her innocence or fragility in this moment
hits IRENE

IRENE reaches forward and grabs CLARE’s hand Surprised
CLARE spins round

They hold one another’s gaze - a well of empathy affection
and history between them

BRIAN RETURNS WITH A SHORT JOLLY LOOKING MAN WHO HE PRESENTS
TO THE TABLE LIKE A PRIZE

The two women break apart

BRIAN (CONT’D)
Now - This is your man

CLARE looks at him benignly She’s nothing if not game

CLARE
Well you’1ll do Come along

CLARE pulls the man to the dance floor

IRENE
He doesn’t stand a chance

BRIAN
(laughs)
None whatsoever
INT REDFIELD HOUSE IRENE AND BRIAN’S BEDROOM NIGHT
IRENE and BRIAN get into bed
IRENE
You know I’m rather glad she came
tonight
BRIAN shrugs
IRENE (CONT’D)
Isn’t she extraordinarily beautiful

though

BRIAN
No not particularly

IRENE
You’re fooling

BRIAN
No She’d be an unusually good
looking white woman I suppose

He starts to kiss her

BRIAN (CONT’D)
Personally I like my women darker

IRENE
Yeah

She breaks away

IRENE (CONT’D)
Maybe it was just because she was
so happy

BRIAN
Shh

They kiss some more It is cautious It has been a long time
and both are a little wary of rejection

BRIAN (CONT’D)
Irene - watch yourself

IRENE
Hmm

BRIAN
Don’t find yourself responsible for
that kind of happiness

IRENE
Nonsense

She kisses him No one is going to be rejected tonight

EXT REDFIELD HOUSE THE SAME

A light goes out in their window

The boy in the window opposite plays the trumpet He is
considerably more accomplished than the last time we heard
him

Across the way a voice screams -

Hey can it

Sunlight

INT REDFIELD HOUSE KITCHEN DAY

ZULENA in her apron preparing vegetables

INT REDFIELD HOUSE FRONT ROOM LATER

The afternoon light streaming in the window wakes IRENE from
a nap in her reading chair

She squints and rubs her head The beginnings of a migraine
The clock chimes

INT REDFIELD HOUSE MIDDLE ROOM HALL THE SAME

IRENE heads upstairs rubbing her head and feeling woozy
BRIAN TED and JUNIOR enter through the front door

JUNIOR
Clare

JUNIOR runs into the living room then the kitchen the
dining room and back into the hall

TED
You going back to bed mama

IRENE starts back down the stairs putting a brave face on

IRENE
No Of course not sweetie

JUNIOR finishes his lap back in the hall Grumpy

JUNIOR
Where’s Clare

IRENE
She’s coming later When you’ll be
in bed She sends you special
kisses

JUNIOR
But Pa said she’d play with me
after school

IRENE
Ted take your brother in the
kitchen and get something to eat

JUNIOR
I don’t want something to eat

He starts to get tearful

IRENE
Ted - take -

TED heads upstairs annoyed not to have his mother’s
attention

TED
Excuse me

Before she can question it JUNIOR runs up after him
BRIAN
I’m sorry I told Junior Clare
would be here

TED slams the door shut IRENE stands and turns to the noise

IRENE
What’s that about

BRIAN weighs up how to tell her so she will hear
BRIAN
Someone called him a dirty you know
what today

He finishes removing his coat and walks towards the kitchen

IRENE
Oh

IRENE sits back down paralyzed

EXT THE REDFIELD HOUSE STREET DAY

An unusually warm day in early winter The trumpet plays
IRENE carries groceries down the block and up the front
steps

INT REDFIELD HOUSE HALL THE SAME

IRENE moves through the hall and down the stairs towards the
kitchen

IRENE
Zulena

INTEXT REDFIELD HOUSE BACK PORCH

CLARE and ZULENA sit together in the sun They are both in
winter clothes with the exception of CLARE who is barefoot
feet on the railings

CLARE
We’re out back ‘Rene

IRENE comes out still holding the groceries

IRENE
What in the world Clare - aren’t
you freezing

CLARE
When the lord brings you a magical
day like today - I say lap it up

ZULENA chuckles

IRENE
Youre crazy I’m getting you a
blanket Zu can you help me with
these groceries

ZULENA
They call this an Indian Summer

CLARE
An Indian summer That’s right
It’s perfect

IRENE
Zu

ZULENA finally gets up and takes the groceries Did she make
a face at CLARE on her way Difficult to say but it looked
like something

IRENE watches her move into the kitchen She takes off her
coat and covers CLARE’s feet with it then sits down beside
her

CLARE
Zu and I were just talking about
the Charlestons next door That
eldest girl is getting so pretty

IRENE
She is Ted can barely look at her

CLARE
Puberty makes such a mess of
friendships

ZULENA (0S)
Puberty is a mess

CLARE
Amen to that

IRENE
I don’t know You had a lot of
friends as I recall

CLARE
I suppose

She observes IRENE

CLARE (CONTD)
Sometimes I wonder why we werent
better friends

IRENE
Oh we did alright

CLARE
I always admired you though You
were so calm and beautiful in the
face of everything

IRENE
Me Come on now you were always
the beauty

CLARE

Not how I see it

CLARE looks at IRENE Something hangs in the air that makes
IRENE uncomfortable

IRENE
Youre staying for dinner

CLARE
I can’t John is coming home

IRENE
Oh I thought next week
CLARE
He’s come back early Misses me
Can’t say the same I wish he’d
stay away always

IRENE
You mustn’t say that

CLARE
‘Mustn’t’ I

She shakes it off - takes the coat off her feet and stands

up

CLARE stretches catlike in the last of the sun

the ease in her body

IRENE
You’re still coming to Bridge

CLARE
Heaven forfend I would miss the
bridge ‘Rene

INT REDFIELD HOUSE FRONT ROOM LATER

IRENE watches

The clock chimes waking IRENE from another nap in her reading
chair She rubs her head again

It is almost as if she’s not sure what to do with herself
when Clare isn’t here

INT REDFIELD HOUSE LIVING ROOM NIGHT

TED and JUNIOR are in PJ’s as IRENE finishes reading them a
bedtime story by the fire BRIAN reads a newspaper

IRENE

(reading)
It was dusky inside and smelled
like wood and oil She bumped her
head on a bare light bulb that was
dangling from the ceiling

(to Ted)
Do you want to take the next part

TED
(reading)
All that time the rat studied the
bulb and pulled the chain and light
flickered
BRIAN
There was a lynching in Little
Rock Pretty bad You hear about

it
IRENE
(mouthing)
Not now
TED

What happened

BRIAN
A black man was accused of
assaulting two white women

TED
What did he do to them

BRIAN
The question is less ‘what’ than
‘if’ Ted

TED

But they lynched the man anyway

BRIAN
Exactly

IRENE
Junior go brush your teeth

BRIAN
They chased him down -

JUNIOR stands but doesn’t leave

IRENE
Brian

BRIAN
- and when they found him they hung
him from a telephone poll and shot
him

JUNIOR stares shocked TED looks at IRENE then back to
BRIAN

JUNIOR
Why papa

BRIAN
Because they hate us son

IRENE
I said Brian - not now

BRIAN picks up JUNIOR and squeezes him

BRIAN
It seems son that we can’t discuss
these things without distressing
the ladies of our family

He tickles JUNIOR who giggles IRENE remains upset

BRIAN (CONT’D)
Go and brush those teeth

BRIAN is rocked

EXT REDFIELD HOUSE THE STREET - LATER

The same shot as always IRENE and CLARE walk the block home
holding large bunches of white flowers

IRENE
I know I take being a mother rather
seriously I know I’m wrapped up in
my boys and the running of my house
- but I don’t think there’s
anything funny in that

CLARE
Oh ‘Rene I know You’re so good
So perfect

They walk past the house with the boy out of sight playing
the trumpet

IRENE
You say that like it’s a bad thing

CLARE pauses on the stoop while IRENE looks for her keys

CLARE
Let’s sit here a minute I like
hearing him play

IRENE sits by her

CLARE (CONT’D)
Don’t think whatever happens that
Ill ever forget how good youve
been to me

IRENE
What are you talking about

CLARE
No - I mean it You see I havent
any proper morals or sense of duty
like you

IRENE
Youre talking nonsense

CLARE
But it’s true ‘Rene Don’t you
realize I’m not like you a bit

CLARE stands and drifts down the steps towards the music She
drifts into a sort of dreamlike state a melancholic reverie
of sorts

CLARE (CONTD)
Why to get the things I want badly
enough - I’d do anything hurt
anybody

IRENE watches her as she traces a finger delicately up the
length of her arm in time with the music It is a sad and
sensual gesture For IRENE it signals that deep and
unidentifiable fear returning to her

CLARE (CONTD)
Throw anything away anything
I’m not safe

IRENE stands up shaking and frightened

IRENE
Clare Stop it

CLARE doesn’t turn around to face her

IRENE (CONT’D)
What you’re saying is wrong
Utterly wickedly wrong You’ve
always had so much you haven’t
given up anything

CLARE drifts further away IRENE watches compelled by the
beauty of her movements

Finally she turns around Huge tears envelop her face

IRENE (CONT’D)
Clare

Again the fear gives way to a need to save her IRENE
embraces her tightly

INT REDFIELD HOUSE IRENE AND BRIAN’S BEDROOM NIGHT

IRENE hears the doorbell She grabs her purse and heads
downstairs

INT REDFIELD HOUSE FRONT ROOM THE SAME

BRIAN is standing over CLARE The silhouette is the same as
before but this time they really are standing very close to
one another

IRENE enters almost embarrassed to have interrupted them -
they look so perfect together

IRENE
Oh I’m sorry has Mae called

BRIAN
No

IRENE
I don’t know where she can be Damn
Zu for taking the night off -

BRIAN
She does have to see her family
from time to time

CLARE
But we’re late already and it’s my
last night before I leave for
Europe

IRENE is compelled by such a strong instinct to make her
happy she doesn’t even quite know what she is saying

IRENE
Why don’t I stay with the boys and
you two go

BRIAN
Really

IRENE
I don’t mind

CLARE
No We can’t leave you

IRENE
Oh yes you can

Now that she has made this choice her pride makes sure she
will follow through to the end

IRENE (CONT’D)
AND - it will make the numbers

even
BRIAN

So now I really have to play

Bridge

INT REDFIELD HOUSE HALL THE SAME

BRIAN moves towards the door CLARE hovers looking a little
guilty

A quiet moment between the two women

IRENE
Go on now

IRENE shoos them out the door Anything to make her happy

CLARE
I’‘1l miss you ‘Rene

IRENE
No you won’t

CLARE kisses IRENE warmly on the cheek

IRENE (CONT’D)
Go on - get

SLAM Peace
She sighs in relief Being with the two of them in the same
room fills her with a deep unidentifiable anxiety so much so

that it is a genuine release when they are gone

What has she done

INT HARLEM SPEAKEASY NIGHT

BRIAN HUGH and IRENE sit at a table watching a solo Trumpet
supported by a Clarinet a Banjo and a humble Upright Piano

IRENE is transfixed by the music battle
BRIAN is distracted and slightly distant

The music ends All clap

IRENE
(to Hugh)
This is where all the talent is
HUGH
Yup and the hooch

He downs his drink

HUGH (CONTD)

Where’s princess tonight It’s a
rarity having the two of you all to
myself

IRENE
In Europe Her daughter is in
boarding school - Switzerland of
all places

BRIAN downs his drink IRENE notices

IRENE (CONT’D)
What

BRIAN
Nothing Just What do you know
about Switzerland

HUGH senses some friction

HUGH
Well I shouldn’t miss her too much

IRENE
Of course we miss her

Actually she’s not entirely sure that she does

HUGH
I find her hard work

IRENE
Many would say the same about you

HUGH
True But I call it shameless what
she does Always playing the
victim ‘Poor little tragic me’
etcetera It’s a low way to make
yourself popular -

tonight

BRIAN
- I don’t think that’s fair -
HUGH
(sternly)
I didn’t quite finish - but she
does maintain a certain charm
BRIAN
You hardly know the woman and since
she’s not here to defend herself -
HUGH
- You will Very chivalrous of you
I’m sure

This stops BRIAN

HUGH’s look suggest his chivalry might have a less moralistic
motivation

The musicians start up again IRENE watches BRIAN concerned

He doesn’t look at her She may as well not exist

EXT REDFIELD HOUSE STREET

The same as ever IRENE walks towards the house with
groceries The neighbor Lance passes her She hardly notices
but still says hello

IRENE
Good afternoon Lance

INT REDFIELD HOUSE KITCHEN AFTERNOON

IRENE is cooking It is Sunday and the absence of ZULENA is
notable

IRENE struggles to find her way around the cabinets
IRENE hates it and is not a good cook but she’s doing her
very best to win back her family

INT REDFIELD HOUSE DINING ROOM THE SAME

JUNIOR is playing on the floor while TED and BRIAN construct
a model toy of some kind on the table

BRIAN
You have to wait for this part to
dry before you can attach it
IRENE enters and starts to lay the table around them
IRENE
This is nice isn’t it Just us
four
BRIAN nods
IRENE (CONT’D)
I’11l make some hot chocolate How

bout that
JUNIOR
Yes please
INT REDFIELD HOUSE KITCHEN MOMENTS LATER

IRENE pours the milk in the pan Her hand is trembling a
little

She stops and turns it around inspecting it as if an alien
thing

INT REDFIELD HOUSE DINING ROOM THE SAME

IRENE comes back in with glasses for the table

TED
No papa I want to keep talking

IRENE
You two look serious

TED
Were talking about John Carter -
the one who got lynched in Little
Rock

IRENE
That again

TED
You gotta know about these things
ma

IRENE
Do I

BRIAN

We got any more nuts
Is he trying to get rid of her Or is she being paranoid

IRENE
Ill go see

TED
I want some too

He follows her out

INT REDFIELD HOUSE KITCHEN THE SAME
IRENE searches for nuts TED follows her fired up

TED
You know they didn’t just shoot him
- they attached his body to a
caravan and dragged it through the
city

She finds them

IRENE
You tell your father that

TED
He told me

IRENE
Did he

TED

You know I’m old enough not to be
spoken to like a child anymore

He grabs the nuts out of her hand and runs back out She
doesn’t have the energy to put up a fight

IRENE is floored by her son’s brief confrontation and struck
that the world seems to be going on without her Her Children
are growing and she can’t seem to focus her attention to
notice

THE MILK BOILS OVER

INT REDFIELD HOUSE DINING ROOM EVENING
IRENE BRIAN TED and JUNIOR finish dinner

JUNIOR
Thank you for dinner mama

The boys head out and upstairs to their room to play Thump
thump thump

After a moment

IRENE
I do wish you wouldn’t keep talking
about all that lynching stuff with
them

BRIAN
Why

IRENE
There’1l be time enough for them to
learn about horrible things when
they’re older Right now they’re
safe

BRIAN
You are absolutely wrong If you’re
so determined that they grow up in
this damned country the sooner
they find out what they’re up
against the better

This hits her hard She takes a moment proceeding carefully
IRENE
But they’re happy Why ruin that I
want them to stay happy

He gets up to clear the dishes

BRIAN
Irene -- what’s the use of keeping
things from them We kept them from
learning the word ‘nigger’ and what
happened They found out the hard
way

IRENE
Stop it Don’t use those words in
my house You’re not to talk about
the race problem I won’t have it

He clangs a plate back down on the table

BRIAN
It’s my house too and I tell you
they’ve got to know these things

IRENE
THEY DON’T They do not

The effort to control it all becomes too much She starts to
cry

He stays where he is and looks at her Shocked by the
outburst

BRIAN
I don’t understand how someone as
intelligent as you can be so
stupid

She desperately wants him to hold her But understanding that
he’s not going to she pulls a handkerchief from her pocket
and composes herself Steely

BRIAN sits back down again closer to her

BRIAN (CONT’D)
I wanted to get them out of this
hellish place years ago -

IRENE
- I’ve been saying we should go
away for a bit But then you’ve
seemed happier having Clare around -

BRIAN
What the hell has Clare got to do
with any of this

IRENE
Only we would have gone on a trip
but for that

BRIAN
No no - I gave up the idea because
you objected

IRENE
I never objected to having Clare
here

BRIAN hits the table
BRIAN

GOD DAMN IT IRENE I’M NOT TALKING
ABOUT CLARE -

IRENE BRIAN (CONT’D)
- because it seems to me - - and I am not talking about
‘a trip’
IRENE (CONT’D) BRIAN (CONTD)
Because it seems to me - I am talking about leaving

this country for good
IRENE (CONT’D)
- You are a lot less content With
what you’ve got when she’s not
here
He takes his plate and leaves her

IRENE breaks down - irretrievably this time

INT REDFIELD HOUSE IRENE AND BRIAN’S BEDROOM DAY

Cold winter sun streams in through the window IRENE sleeps
fully clothed the light shimmering over her form On her
bedside table is a bottle of migraine medication

She stirs a little tries to focus in on the abstract shapes
dancing in front of her eyes

She stares at the CRACK IN THE CEILING

With her eyes still closed she loosens one of the buttons on
her cardigan and drifts back to sleep

FADE SLOWLY TO
BLACK

The sound of wind in the trees

FADE SLOWLY IN

INT REDFIELD HOUSE IRENE AND BRIAN’S BEDROOM DAY

A different outfit the same scenario Now there are two
bottles of medication on the table One lying open and empty

IRENE’s shut eyes begin to open

Again she stares at the CRACK IN THE CEILING NOW LARGER THAN
BEFORE

She closes her eyes again
She opens them

She is vaguely aware of someone sitting on the end of the
bed Initially it’s just a shape in silhouette - hazy
through her sleepy eyes Is it CLARE

It focuses and we see it is BRIAN He is staring right at
her Motionless An unfathomable expression in his eyes

He may have been there some time
She closes her eyes again

IRENE
I’m getting up Don’t worry It was
good of you to think to call me

She sits up He stays still

BRIAN
Always the attentive husband

She rubs her head

IRENE
Bother those people coming to tea
Thank goodness everything is ready

BRIAN
Clare’s downstairs

IRENE
Clare How I didn’t invite her
Purposely

BRIAN
She’s been back for a while Zu’s
always taking messages and you
never respond Might a mere man ask
why

IRENE
This party is for Hugh and Hugh
happens not to care a great deal
for her - so I didn’t ask her

BRIAN
If you ask me his dislike happens
to be less to do with her and more
to do with the attention she
happens not to give him much of

IRENE
You love Hugh

BRIAN
I do But you’ll admit he has a
rather God-like opinion of himself

IRENE
I disagree He thinks far better of
himself than that

This doesn’t get the laugh she would have hoped
IRENE gets up and starts to get ready

BRIAN goes to the door and stays staring curiously at the
floor

The sealant for the floor board has come up
IRENE looks at him staring at the floor

IRENE (CONT’D)
Brian

BRIAN
I’m sorry Irene It’s my fault She
seemed so hurt at being left out I
told her I was sure you’d
forgotten

IRENE is hurt and enraged Not because of what he’s said but
because the way he’s said it suggests something more
entirely

IRENE
But Brian I -

He goes to leave and stops with his hand on the door handle
He stiffens imperceptibly like a man about to receive a blow
then looks at her slowly with a look that is as good an
admission of guilt as the hardest piece of evidence

It hits her The hazy depressed out of focus quality of
IRENE’s life falls into sharp and painful relief

IRENE (CONT’D)
You spoke to her then

BRIAN
Yes

She buries the torrent of emotion and goes to compose herself
in her mirror

IRENE
Of course you did And in spite of
what I said Clare does add to any
party She’s so easy on the eye

He looks at her again sadly This time he looks frail - like
a man in love with his wife but unable to connect to her
anymore From his perspective she is a woman slipping out of
his grasp into a depressive fog

BRIAN
You won’t be long

IRENE shakes her head Unable to speak or look at him He
leaves

IRENE stares hard at the mirror

INT REDFIELD HOUSE MIDDLE ROOM FRONT ROOM LATER

The tea party in HUGH’s honor is filled with HARLEM
INTELLECTUALS and a spattering of white ones all talking
loudly

IRENE pours tea for a group of ladies but her focus is very
much on CLARE

IRENE
Josephine Baker No I’ve never seen
her

CLARE sits a little way off holding court with a charmed
gaggle

MAN (0S)
You’re missing out

IRENE
I think she might have been in
Shuffle Along when I saw it but I
don’t remember

LADY (0S)
I much prefer her to Ethel Waters

IRENE
Ethel Waters is awfully good

IRENE carries the tea pot over to FELISE

IRENE (CONT’D)
Hello Felise So happy you made
it

She moves on with her tea pot FELISE follows

FELISE (0S)
Come back Irene You haven’t sat
down all afternoon I want to talk
to you

IRENE spots BRIAN and CLARE sitting close to one another
talking

FELISE (0S) (CONT’D)
Come out of it Whatever it is you
look like the second grave digger

From her perspective CLARE is the center of attention - the
natural host Any attempt towards kindness from CLARE now
just feels like charity to IRENE and stokes her lack of self
worth

IRENE
I’m not quite feeling up to par
The weather I guess

FELISE
Buy yourself an expensive frock
child It always helps

IRENE clutches the tea pot hard as she watches CLARE

FELISE (CONT’D)
I’ve been trying to get her alone
all afternoon

She moves towards CLARE
DAVE joins his wife

FELISE (CONT’D)
Clare You look too divine sitting
so quiet like a painting Will you
come to ours for a little gathering
next month

IRENE stares on isolated

CLARE
Felise I was just telling Dave
I’ve just finished his book

FELISE
Youve read his books
CLARE
Of course I have I’ve read all of

them
IRENE notices him glance at CLARE

HUGH has moved up behind IRENE during this He observes her
with concern

IRENE is suddenly very hot She looks at the tea pot in her
hands - it doesn’t belong to her nothing does

She looks back at CLARE so much more composed and capable
than she is in this moment

Overwhelmed with panic and surprise at HUGH standing so close
to her she drops the tea pot

CLARE BRIAN etc look over at the accident

Dark tea stains dot the bright rug

HUGH grabs her elbow Hidden support

HUGH
Steady

HUGH covers

HUGH (CONT’D)
So sorry ‘Rene I must have pushed
you Clumsy of me Don’t tell me -
it’s priceless and irreplaceable

She rises to the game however there is a mania bubbling
underneath it They crouch down to pick up the pieces

As she looks away BRIAN looks to IRENE with concern

IRENE
No no you didn’t push me I’m quite
sure That - That pot was THE
ugliest thing that your ancestors
- the charming confederates ever
owned

(MORE )

IRENE (CONTD)
I’ve forgotten how many thousands
of years ago it was that Brian’s
great- great - great great
something uncle owned it - what I’m
coming to is the fact that I’ve
never figured out a way of getting
rid of it that is until about
just this minute Inspiration I
had only to break it and I was rid
of it forever Simple

HUGH
Well done

She smiles Thank you

Across the room CLARE smiles at her too

INT REDFIELD HOUSE HALL LATER

IRENE stands by the door as THE GUESTS are leaving

BRIAN stands in the living room doorway as guests pass

HUGH wal

lks up to IRENE

HUGH
My lovely well done

HUGH moves to the doorway

HUGH (CONTD)
Brian thank you so much

BRIAN
Thank you

CLARE (0S)
Bye ‘Rene

CLARE kisses IRENE on the cheek

Out of habit without even thinking

IRENE
You’re staying for dinner

CLARE
Can’t tonight

She’s fixated on what CLARE might be doing tonight

IRENE
Oh Right Too bad Brian has work
tonight anyway
CLARE moves through to the door to say goodbye to BRIAN

She looks at BRIAN and CLARE kiss cheeks Could they be
meeting

CLARE
So glad to see you

BRIAN
So long

More guests shuffle CLARE out the door

BRIAN again looks at IRENE with concern

INT REDFIELD HOUSE LIVING ROOM EVENING

IRENE is putting up Christmas decorations She opens some
Christmas cards and places them above the mantle

Out of sight THE BOYS and BRIAN come in the front door
letting in the cold The bang of the door snaps her back into
reality

THE BOYS run upstairs past the living room doorway trailing
snow BRIAN stops

BRIAN
Evening

BRIAN’s POV as she carries on decorating the tree

He looks despairing but familiar with the sequence of events
Sure of not getting an answer he walks away

EXT MANHATTAN STREET DAY

The street is busy with Christmas shoppers IRENE and FELISE
come out of a store with some bags and rush against the
blizzard

FELISE
Heaven’s my eyes are watering

IRENE
I fear my fingers might fall off
The wind is brutal

The wind blows them round a corner and straight into JOHN
BELLEW
IRENE (CONT’D)
(looking down)

Pardon -

JOHN
Oh Mrs Redfield How do you do

IRENE looks up and is stunned
JOHN takes off his hat Holds out his hand smiling genially

He looks from IRENE to FELISE clocks FELISE’s golden face
her frizzy black hair

His smile fades but his hand remains outstretched

IRENE registers the disgust in his face She decisively links
FELISE’s arm and walks on

FELISE
(looking behind her)
Well that was abrupt

IRENE looks back JOHN’s hand still outstretched staring
after them confused

IRENE
Felise you just passed the only
person that I’ve ever met while
disguised as a white woman
EXT MANHATTAN STREET MOMENTS LATER
From a little distance we watch as IRENE leaves FELISE
behind and hurries towards the subway

EXT REDFIELD STREET

IRENE walks the blocks towards her house eager to get to the
phone and warn CLARE of what has happened

As she walks a light snowfall starts
It stops her

Thoughtful - She walks the steps to her house and enters

INT REDFIELD HOUSE HALL MOMENTS LATER
IRENE enters and picks up the phone

IRENE
Hello Central Quincy 5 4 7 3

The call takes a moment to connect
IRENE (CONT’D)
Hello Is Mrs Bellew in It’s
urgent No
She makes a decision
IRENE (CONT’D)
Never mind It’s not that urgent
I’1ll try again later
She hangs up the phone and removes her hat and coat in the
mirror trying to regain her calm

INT REDFIELD HOUSE KITCHEN - THE SAME

IRENE enters the kitchen In a routine fashion IRENE gets
herself a glass of water

ZULENA is preparing vegetables

IRENE looks out the back window

The snow is coming down harder now Thick and fast and
settling

INT REDFIELD HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT

IRENE lies in bed fully clothed and awake staring out the
window

She watches the snow stop falling

INT REDFIELD HOUSE MIDDLE ROOM HALL -

She walks downstairs and out the front door

EXT REDFIELD HOUSE STOOP - NIGHT
IRENE sits on the stoop breathes in the fresh air

She’s shaking Only partly from the cold

She can see BRIAN approaching He seems happy and content
BRIAN
Irene What you doing It’s
freezing
IRENE doesn’t respond
BRIAN (CONT’D)
Aren’t we going to that party with
Clare

She nods BRIAN goes inside

She sits there quivering with the chain of events that she
may have set in motion and excited by them

EXT FELISE’S APARTMENT BUILDING NIGHT

There is a courtyard in front of the building covered in
undisturbed freshly fallen snow

We hear that familiar CLARE laugh BRIAN and CLARE walk
through the arch on to the snow with IRENE a little way
behind Their dialogue is almost out of range

BRIAN
Ever go up to the sixth floor

CLARE
Of course My father was a janitor
In the good ol’ days before every
ramshackle apartment had its own
elevator

BRIAN
Elevator

CLARE
You can’t mean we’ve got to walk
up

BRIAN
All the way to the top

CLARE
Oh lord

He opens the door and lets them through

INT FELISE’S APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRWELL - CONT’D

IRENE BRIAN and CLARE climb the six floors BRIAN runs
ahead CLARE tries to catch up with him but is struggling in
her shoes

CLARE
Why on earth would anyone live
here

BRIAN

She claims it discourages the
casual visitor

BRIAN runs ahead further two steps at a time

BRIAN (CONT’D)
Says she’d rather be dead than
bored

CLARE and IRENE pause to take a breath

CLARE
Damn these thin shoes
(beat)
What is it ‘Rene

Pause

IRENE
Clare - Have you ever thought what
youd do if John found out

A brief brief smile that leaves as fast as it came

CLARE
Yes

Brian leans over the bannister from above

BRIAN
Don’t fall by the wayside before
the fourth floor I absolutely
refuse to carry anyone up more than
the last two flights

CLARE laughs

IRENE
And what would you

CLARE
Id do what I want to do more than
anything else right now

(MORE )

CLARE (CONTD)
Id come up here to live In
Harlem with you

CLARE stands up and bounds up the stairs to link arms with
BRIAN on the floor above

CLARE (CONT’D)
Oh lord

IRENE watches the two of them above her through the fractured
lens of the stairwell as they reach the fourth floor

They lean over the bannister to hurry IRENE

BRIAN
Come on slowpoke

IRENE looks up at them in all their exuberance beauty and
happiness wishing she were anywhere else

INT FELISE’S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A dozen or so guests including RALPH HAZLETON dot the untidy
living room FELISE changes a record on the phonograph while
DAVE holds court halfway through a story

IRENE is sitting silently by herself on a sofa opposite them

DAVE
Dinner at Eddie’s then Leroy’s
then Smalls The dancers seem
strange to anyone else there

FELISE
No honey just the liquor

DAVE
And that is why I have given it up

FELISE
Since this morning

DAVE
Yes And nothing in the least
exciting has happened to me

FELISE passes him a drink

DAVE (CONTD)
Thank you

BRIAN
I wouldn’t - I’ve heard the drinks
here arent safe

General laughter DAVE moves dispersing the circle
DAVE perches on the arm of the sofa to talk to her
DAVE
Irene Have you taken a vow never
to laugh again
IRENE
No - it’s simply the rest of you

are so clever Im speechless

She watches CLARE talking with BRIAN and RALPH

DAVE
You havent a drink What will you
take

IRENE

Ginger-ale and three drops of
scotch Scotch first then the ice
then the ginger ale

FELISE hears this
FELISE
Don’t attempt to mix that yourself

Dave darling - Have the butler in

IRENE
- and the footman

The laughter settles

Smoking a cigarette IRENE moves to the adjoining room and
pushes open a large window

Outside is the quiet that only comes with the aftermath of
heavy snow Cool and serene an extreme contrast to the
party Silence

CLARE notices IRENE standing in the window She joins FELISE
standing in the arch between the two rooms

CLARE keeps one eye on IRENE

CLARE
It really is a perfect evening

FELISE
Good

IRENE throws her smoke out the window and watches it fall
down A moment of peace She takes a deep breath out the
window

The song changes The party noise breaks back in

DAVE approaches behind her and takes IRENE’s arm and leads
her a little way away from the window

DAVE
Don’t stand there aren’t you
freezing Come along and talk to
me or at least listen to me
gabble

As she is turned around IRENE sees CLARE now standing in the
arch with BRIAN and FELISE

Almost in slow motion she scans the room starting with BRIAN
and CLARE then slowly as if against her will her eye is
pulled towards the other arch through which she glimpses what
looks like JOHN BELLEW speaking to a guest at the front
door

GUEST (0S)
Evening Can I help you

JOHN (0S)
Let me in

GUEST (0S)
Perhaps you’ve come to the wrong

home

JOHN (0S)
I know where I am My wife is in
there

DAVE lets go of IRENE’sS arm and moves towards the door
leaving her looking on panic stricken and isolated

GUEST
Your wife No sir she’s not here
I guarantee it I’m afraid you’re
wrong

JOHN
I’m NOT wrong

GUEST
Do not come in Sir calm down

IRENE looks to CLARE BRIAN has left her and is moving into
the hall via the other entrance to the hall
JOHN (0S)
I’ve been to the Redfield’s and I
know she is with them

CLARE stands beckoning to RALPH

CLARE
Where’s my drink Ralph

CLARE starts to move towards the window

IRENE is now watching JOHN in one arch and CLARE in the
other Their view of one another separated by a wall

DAVE blocks JOHN from going any further

DAVE
Now maybe you ought to calm down
and we -

JOHN
If you’re finished get out of my
way

IRENE looks on mesmerized and motionless
BRIAN joins the commotion around JOHN

BRIAN
I’m Redfield

JOHN pushes past BRIAN and gets into the room

BRIAN (CONT’D)
What the devil’s the matter with
you

JOHN
You don’t get to tell me what to
do Any of you people

JOHN sees CLARE standing at the window composed ready and
seemingly unaware of danger

RALPH comes through from the other room holding two drinks
for himself and CLARE

IRENE looks at CLARE who is looking at JOHN

JOHN furiously points his finger at CLARE

JOHN (CONTD)
You liar

FELISE jumps in between them

FELISE
Careful You’re the only white man
here

JOHN

A damned dirty liar -
IRENE looks at CLARE CLARE looks back to IRENE There is the
faintest of smiles on her lips her eyes are shining She
looks down to the open window beside her

IRENE turns to face JOHN backing up slightly and reaching
for CLARE’s hand behind her just as

JOHN breaks out from behind FELISE pushes her out the way
and lunges violently towards CLARE

IRENE reflexively swipes her arm out behind her to protect or
push CLARE away from one imminent danger and accidentally or
purposefully towards another

BRIAN runs in gasps

IRENE looks to her side where CLARE’s body had just been and
now where JOHN is

She looks in front to the STUNNED faces looking beyond her
and out the window

The guests move to the window to see what has happened

GUEST
Good Lord Jesus

JOHN runs out of the apartment

IRENE stays rigid in shock still looking into the room while
everyone stands in front of her

A sudden animated rush as everyone else scrambles to the
door

INT FELISE’S APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRWELL - NIGHT

The party guests run down the stairs in silent panic

Fifth floor

Fourth floor

Third floor

Second floor

Ground floor

INT FELISE’S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Once IRENE is alone and breathing steadily she slowly turns
around to look

Far below on the snow lies CLARE - fallen

Her dress splayed over the snow like an angel

IRENE walks slowly away from the window trying to regulate
her breath

INT FELISE’S APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRWELL - CONT’D
IRENE descends the six floors slowly

One at a time alone and in silence

As she gets to the first floor she hears a voice in the
atrium out of sight

VOICE SOMEWHERE (0S)
The husband’s just sitting there

ANOTHER VOICE (0S)
Is she still breathing

VOICE SOMEWHERE (0S)
I don’t know

ANOTHER VOICE (0S)
What do you mean you don’t know

VOICE SOMEWHERE (0S)
I’m not even sure she’s dead

She gasps and breaks into a cold sweat moving quicker
towards the door and opening it into the bright white of the
snow noise and activity

EXT FELISE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONT’D

IRENE moves into the courtyard towards a circle including TWO
POLICE OFFICERS BRIAN FELISE and DAVE to her left

POLICE OFFICER
(to the group)
Just trying to protect his wife
Doesn’t strike me as particularly
unusual

DAVE
Here’s Irene now

BRIAN sees IRENE they stare at each other in shock

IRENE
Is she- is she -

IRENE turns to see CLARE lying dead in the snow JOHN sitting
right beside her

IRENE nearly wretches as BRIAN wraps his coat about her
BRIAN holds IRENE tightly
He loves her She realizes it
BRIAN

There there Irene You mustn’t

Youll make yourself sick
His voice breaks
IRENE glances behind him where RALPH HAZELTON is sitting He
is weeping uncontrollably Is it possible that it was RALPH

who was having an affair with CLARE all along

IRENE looks to where DAVE is being questioned by one of the
POLICE OFFICER

DAVE
Irene was right there beside her
weren’t you Irene

OFFICER (0S)
This lady here

The officer turns his attention to IRENE

OFFICER (CONT’D)
You’re sure she fell Her husband
didn’t give her a shove or anything
like that as Dr Redfield here seems
to think

IRENE looks behind her to JOHN who is alone near the body in
shock

IRENE
No No I’m quite certain that he
didn’t She just fell before anyone
could stop her - it was so quick -
I

OFFICER
You’re sure

IRENE looks at the OFFICER looming above her her knees
giving up

BRIAN
Careful Careful

IRENE falls to the ground drowning BRIAN supports her
OFFICER (0S)
So none of you saw how she went

out

FELISE (0S)
He was upset it’s true

OFFICER (0S)
So an accident

FELISE (0S)
I guess an accident yes

OFFICER (0S)
That’s what I thought

The OFFICER and DAVE etc move towards JOHN
BRIAN and IRENE stay outside the crowd huddled in the snow

IRENE buries her face into her husband’s neck and cries
quietly Almost inaudible

BRIAN
I love you

We crane up as the body is carried away into an ambulance
and the two OFFICERS move back towards the building while the
rest of the group close in around JOHN

OFFICER
Death by misadventure I’m inclined
to believe Let’s go up and have
another look at that window

Slowly they become indistinguishable dots in the snow

FADE TO BLACK
