WALL STREET MONEY NEVER SLEEPS

Written by

Allan Loeb

A BLACK SCREEN
Onto which is written in white letters

When business in the United States underwent a
contraction the Federal Reserve created more paper

reserves

The excess credit spilled over into the market triggering a
fantastic speculative boom

EXT CLINTON CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - DAY

Its a summer day The heat floats above the pavement
A cab waits in the lot

The large gates of New Yorks largest prison open and

todays
group of newly released emerge
They pass a guard who lifts up a copy of The USA Today to
reveal the headlines and date that tells us its 2002
Amongst this group we find a man carrying a small duffel
And we know this man He is Gordon Gekko
But he is not as slick as we remember he doesnt have
that
gleam in his eyes or that gel in his hair No this isa
very different version of the man we remember because now
theres nothing behind those eyes nothing we can read
anyway
And he just stands there coldly watching his recently
freed brethren greet their wives and children reuniting
with the people who waited for them the people who love
them

The cab slowly pulls up and Gordon holds up a finger wait
a minute He glares over to the entrance of the lot

waiting for his people but they dont come

And the cab waits Gordon stands there in the heat
completely disappointed and completely alone

And we

SLAM BACK INTO

As the white letters reappear on the screen

As a result the American economy collapsed

Taken from an article about the pre-crash 1929
written by Alan Greenspan

JACOB (VO)
Its funny the more we find ourselves
slaves of chance the more
superstitious we become

SLAM INTO A MANHATTAN MORNING
A gorgeous June Friday

JACOB (VO) (CONTD)
And that would make Andrew Zabel one
superstitious motherfucker

Find ANDREW ZABEL mid 50s shaved-head and in good shape

JACOB (VO) (CONTD)
He started every day the same exact
way He would walk his dogs then
leave his Gramercy Park condo at seven
am on the dot

As Andrew leaves 36 East Gramercy Park East an impressive
building made of white stone
Andrew wears a suit and holds an umbrella

JACOB (VO) (CONTD)
And he would take an umbrella with him
even when there was no chance of
rain

As Andrew heads to a newsstand and throws the INDIAN CLERK a
familiar nod And without saying a word the clerk knows
exactly what to give him
JACOB (VO) (CONTD)
Hed buy a journal a tin of chocolate
Altoids and a cold bottle of Poland
Springs water

23RD ST SUBWAY STATION
As Andrew bounds down the stairs and through the gate

JACOB (VO) (CONTD)
He had timed it out so he wouldnt
have to wait more than three minutes
for the uptown five train

As Andrew emerges out to the platform and sees the headlight
from the 5 train coming down the tunnel

JACOB (VO) (CONTD)
I guess you could say that day was
like every other

And as the train approaches holding that Wall Street
Journal the bottle of water and that tin of Altoids

JACOB (VO) (CONTD)
Except for one thing

Andrew Zabel simply steps forward and falls onto the
track

And as the train SLAMS into US

DARKNESS
Which holds for an uncomfortably long moment then
Money Never Sleeps graces the screen and we move down

below the letters to find

A CHART
Now filling the screen Its of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average Its for the year 2008 and its down to the
right not good
A circle marks Friday June 13th Follow a blue line back
three days and stop Another circle is now formed and
Matthew Goods Giant rings out
CARD JUNE 6th 2008 8 DAYS EARLIER

MIDTOWN
Opening titles the workplace throng listening to their
holds

iPods checking their Blackberrys and sipping their
Starbucks

Move with this throng to the Matthew Good tune under the
opening titles past 745 Seventh Avenue the Lehman Brothers

building with that giant ticker that rounds the building
posting Dow 1257976 -- 11986
And keep moving all is normal in the financial center of

the universe

Land on a impressive modern building made of glass and steel
then climb up it to the top to the penthouse office
suites

And push in through the window to be in

INT KELLER ZABEL INVESTMENTSANDREW ZABELS OFFICE - DAY

with the major indices and just one stock ticker KZI

ZABEL

Zabel forces a smile But Jacob can tell somethings wrong
with him

JACOB
Are you okay
Zabel doesnt answer he just nods to the envelope

ZABEL
Open it
He opens the envelope and looks down at the check
1450000 And he can barely contain his excitement

JACOB
Thank you

display humility with a trace of mischievousness thrown in

Hes definitely sexy definitely cerebral and definitely

And Jacob tries to play it cool as he looks up at the

electronic ticker on the wall 1259246 -- 13246

ROBBY

JACOB

And Robby stops walking

ROBBY (CONTD)
Senior year I couldnt get my mind
around how all those dot coms with no

dollars and you were the one who said
something that made it all clear for
me

JACOB
I dont remember
Turning to Jacob with

ROBBY
An assets value can only be priced
at its perception

JACOB
I said that
Robby confirms then
ROBBY

So buddy -- it dont matter if the
rumors are true or not Because in
this climate if they exist at

Looking his friend head on

ROBBY (CONTD)

Jacob

INT KELLER ZABEL INVESTMENTSTRADING FLOOR - DAY
The normally very loud and frenetic place is very quiet and
sober today They all watch Alexis Glick report

ALEXIS GLICK (ON THE TVS)
Rumors of insolvency have hit the
street concerning KZIs books and
theyre shooting first then asking
questions later The stock is now
trading just a bit over thirty one
dollars a share down almost forty
four percent on the session
And standing in the center of the floor watching this

JACOB
Stunned horrified his universe becoming unglued
And he turns to Audry helpless and in shock
JACOB
Who did this to us
She can only shrug tears in her eyes
Jacob shifts his gaze over to the trading floors electronic
ticker on the wall KZI 2634 -2957
And he moves for the elevator banks unable to take it

anymore

EXT MIDTOWN -DAY

Furious Jacob walks down 6th ave with his phone to his ear

JACOB
Andrew call me back Im going to
find out who did this to us I swear
to God if its the last thing I do

(BEAT)

Were going to bounce back from this

And were going to find out who spread
the rumor and then were going to
destroy them

He disconnects the call and keeps walking

After a beat with his anger brewing Jacob SLAMS his

phone
down on the ground and it shatters

INT JACOBS APARTMENT - DAY
Jacob lays on his couch vacantly pondering the ceiling
Fox Business plays on the new plasma tv on the wall
footage of THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK a tough looking man in
his 40s speaking to the press outside of The State Capitol

GOVERNOR (FOOTAGE)
I dont know anything about the
solvency of Keller Zabel I do know
that whats bringing down the stock at
this precise moment are rumors And
this practice of short selling
American financial institutions then
floating rumors in order to profit
from them must be stopped The uptick
rule must be reinstated
Jacob glares over to the tv

GOVERNOR (FOOTAGE) (CONTD)

And once again I will point to

largely unregulated world of hedge

funds an ever-growing and

increasing powerful area of the market

that I repeatedly tried to regulate as

Chairman of the SEC
And theres a loud knock on the door Jacob ignores it

GOVERNOR (FOOTAGE) (CONTD)

And the collapse of this legendary New

York financial institution is why I

continue to fight that battle as

Governor of this great state
Another knock this time louder Jacob mutes the tv

JACOB
What
From the door

ROBBY
(SHOUTING)
Jacob answer the door

Jacob gets up moves slowly and answers the door

ROBBY (CONTD)
You werent answering your phone
shatters

JACOB
It broke
Robby sharply nods

ROBBY

Dude

He stops short swallows
JACOB

What
ROBBY

I just found this out and it hasnt
hit the press yet

Once again he stops short and looks away in frustration
JACOB
What Robby what are you trying to
say
ROBBY

Andrew Zabel threw himself in front of

the subway this morning

Jacob just stands in that doorway No reaction at all
Absolutely frozen

INT JACOBS APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Jacob now stands in the center of his apartment Completely
in shock As he looks to the plasma Fox Business on mute
Brian Sullivan reporting under the graphic KZI 1934 -

3728

He glares at it for a long moment then almost calmly
picks up a chair and throws it into the tv which

And Jacob not sure what to do Until he turns and
sees on the dresser a gorgeous engagement ring sitting
in an open box a fuck you ring

EXT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITYCAMPUS - DAY

As Jacob bounds the steps of the Business School and heads
into the old stone building

INT COLUMBIA SCHOOL OF BUSINESSURIS LECTURE HALL - DAY
The lecture hall is packed with wall to wall students

stands at the back
A PROFESSOR is at the podium

PROFESSOR
Our speaker today has quite a
checkered background in the world of
finance
Some laughter from the room

PROFESSOR (CONTD)
He graduated from City College in 1966
and became a securities broker at
Hudson River Bank then moved on to
Smith Barney In 1973 he went out on
his own to establish a spectacular
career as a independent trader then an
active participant in the LBO craze of
the 1980s

(BEAT)
In 1988 he was indicted for insider
trading and then charged with other
various forms of securities fraud and
IRS violations In one of the most
harshest sentences ever given to a
white collar criminal he served
fourteen years in a maximum security
prison and he wants me to stress that
it was not a country club
Again laughter from the floor

PROFESSOR (CONTD)
Since his release in 2002 he has
written and has spoken publicly about
what he refers to as the current state
of the world economy He is not
allowed to trade on the US exchanges
His new book Moral Hazard Why Wall
Street Has Finally Gone Too Far
comes out in October

(BEAT)
Please welcome Gordon Gekko

Jacob

The room applauds and out to the podium slowly walks

GORDON GEKKO

No swagger in his step not in a suit hair not slicked

back but still looks fucking good

As he waits for the applause to wind down and even a
little longer surveying every corner of the large room
commanding its full attention getting it holding the
silence until finally he leans into the mic and
says

GORDON GEKKO
Youre all pretty much fucked
The room breaks into laughter Gordon smiles and waits for
it to die down

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
Whats not funny is whats happening
out there I dont think people get
it And I know the financial center
of the world doesnt get it which
happens to be Washington DC now

As he takes to a pace

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
To understand where we are we need to
understand how we got here No good
deed goes unpunished all fires start
with a well meaning spark and we
wanted Americans to be able to afford
homes Sounds nice enough lets try
to get the middle and lower classes
into homes they can own So we made
money cheap and lowered restrictions
on mortgage lending
As he takes a moment and looks over the room

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)

Somebody reminded me the other night
that I once said greed is good I
swear I dont remember it but it
sounds like something I would say in
the Eighties

(BEAT)
And I was right then Greed was good
America needed greed and risk-taking
and leverage to get to become the
superpower we are or were And
capitalism needed greed and risk and
leverage to become the economic
platform it has become but those
same attributes that got us there are
now the liabilities that threaten to

destroy us

Jacobs blackberry vibrates and he checks it He has a text
KZI -- wtf

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)

So greed has been redefined Who

knows -- maybe it was always like this
and like everything else in this
world its good and it is evil
Taking a moment to survey the room

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
Because people -- its greed that
caused someone who aspires to own a
seven-hundred thousand dollar house
they cant afford to take on a loan
theyll never be able to pay back
and its greed that caused their
mortgage lender to give them that loan
then sell it right away and its
greed that caused the buyer of that
loan to slice it into a million little
pieces then spit them all over the
world and its greed that caused
the rating agency to give that toxic
loan a triple-A rating just because it
was mixed in with some good loans
and its greed that caused the
insurance company to insure that loan
Jacob quickly glances down again at his blackberry and
checks
the quote KZI 1453

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)

They were insuring the end of the
world When the world explodes
just find us in the rubble and well
be sure to pay your claim
Drawing in a deep breath

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)

CMOs CLOs CBOs CDOs CDSs
SPEs ABCPsSIVs REMICs CMBSs
toxic traunches ninja loans credit
default swaps affinity marketing
stapled financing synthetic
securitization

(BEAT)
Maybe I was in prison too long but I
have no idea what half that shit
means
The room laughs in agreement

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
And Im considered a pretty smart guy
when it comes to finance
And Jacobs blackberry vibrates again This time he removes

it from his pocket doesnt check it and simply turns it
off

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)

And if I know our central bank --
which I do -- I predict its going to
throw gasoline on this fire with more
cheap money and federal bailouts and

HEAD-IN-THE-SAND MANIPULATED
statistics on productivity and
inflation
And Gordon stops pacing takes a moment for effect

Then sums it all up with

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
So no good deed goes unpunished and
all fires start with a well-meaning
spark and when you take free money and
no lending standards then add it with
unaccountable risk and ungodly
leverage and unbridled greed what
you end up with is cancer

And Gordon takes in a deep breath

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
Systemic malignant and global
Now the room is completely silent

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
Do they still have the VandT restaurant
on Amsterdam Is that still there
A stunned girl in the front row shakes her head

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
(with a smile)
God I loved their pizza

INT URIS HALLWAY - DAY

Jacob looks on as Gordon is surrounded by professors and
students alike

GORDON GEKKO
(announcing to the throng)
Ill give you six minutes then I
really have to go

EXT URIS HALL - EXACTLY 6 MINUTES LATER

Gordon quickly walks out with his PUBLISHER a woman in her

40s and heads into the quad Jacob immediately matches their
stride

JACOB
Mr Gekko can I speak to you fora
moment
As he keeps walking

GORDON GEKKO
Youre too late Sport QandAs over

JACOB
My name is Jacob Moore and Im dating
your daughter

(AND THEN)
Im going to ask her to marry me
And this makes Gordon stop and finally face Jacob with

GORDON GEKKO
Ill give you nine minutes

EXT 112TH STREET - MOMENTS LATER
As Gordon and Jacob leave the campus and take to the street

GORDON GEKKO
Keller Zabel Then you have my
apologies

JACOB
Yeah

GORDON GEKKO
Stocks in a free fall My guess is
that it just lost its Bar Mitzvah
Jacob quickly takes out his blackberry turns it on and
checks to see Gordons right KZI 1254

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
By the end of the day it might not
even be potty trained

And Jacob looks at him

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
I might not be allowed to trade Jake
but I still love to watch from home

JACOB
Andrew Zabel took me under his wing
when I was in high school He
basically got me my scholarship to
Yale then hired me right out of
business school

GORDON GEKKO
Andrews smart he beats the
benchmarks consistently Hell land
on his feet

JACOB
Hes dead
And Gordon stops walking and regards Jacob Who confirms

JACOB (CONTD)
He killed himself this morning
As that registers

GORDON GEKKO
Im sorry to hear that

JACOB
He was a father to me

And Jacob coldly shakes it off then sucks in a deep breath
and looks into Gordons eyes genuine and lofty

JACOB (CONTD)
I love your daughter very much and I
would be honored if

And realizing what this is Gordon starts to laugh
which
throws Jacob off

JACOB (CONTD)
you would bless-- I really dont
understand what you find so funny

GORDON GEKKO
My daughter hasnt spoken to me for
eleven years and you know it She
blames me for her brothers overdose
and every other disaster thats fallen
upon the world since the mid-nineties

(BEAT)
And by the way isnt it strange that
Winnie would date a guy from the
street

JACOB
What

GORDON GEKKO
She hates me And she hates Wall
Street and everything it represents
so dont you find it curious that she
would fall in love with you
And that slams into Jacob whos frozen for a beat
Jacob finally snaps out of it then joins Gordon

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
So you want my blessing

JACOB
Yes

GORDON GEKKO
I guess I should know a little about
you first Where did you grow up

JACOB
Matinecock

GORDON GEKKO
Im impressed
JACOB
It wasnt like that I mean we didnt
have much money My mother was a
tailor

GORDON GEKKO
And your father what did he do

JACOB
Disappear
And Gordon regards Jacob for a long moment taking him in
until

GORDON GEKKO
Clever
Jacob looks down the street

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
What are you looking for

JACOB
Your town car
With a laugh

GORDON GEKKO
Well pal
As Gordon pats Jacob on the back

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)

and heads for the subway

INT 110TH STREET SUBWAY STATION - DAY

Gordon takes out his wallet and produces his metrocard
Jacob notices a picture of Winnie in the wallet

JACOB

(RE PICTURE)

Gordon shrugs and shows the picture to Jacob
Its of a young Winnie and younger Gordon on the back of a
gorgeous white horse
GORDON GEKKO
She was eight in that one It was
taken in Egypt

JACOB
Can I have it
(EXPLAINING)
She doesnt keep pictures from her

childhood
Gordon slowly nods

GORDON GEKKO
What do I get in return

JACOB
You wanna make a trade
And Gordon thinks about then

GORDON GEKKO
Yes Ill give you this picture and
in return Id like a picture of
Winnie taken recently without
you in it

JACOB
I dont have one on me
Gordon sighs takes the picture out of his wallet and hands
it to Jacob

GORDON GEKKO
Then Ill give you this one on margin

PLATFORM
As they wait for the train
Jacob produces the ring box and opens it to show Gordon the
ring

JACOB
I really did come to ask for your
blessing

GORDON GEKKO
No you didnt Nice ring
As the train arrives
GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
Its so typical
(inside of an ironic laugh)
Levered to the hilt and with the
ship going down
As he gets on

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)

INT THE DOWNTOWN 3 TRAIN - DAY

Gordon stares at a one sheet advertisement on the wall
And he doesnt look at Jacob when he says

think I know that look

(BEAT)

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)

I know it by sight Kid because I
lived it for years Christ I can
even smell it on you

JACOB
Smell what on me

GORDON GEKKO
Revenge
Jacob just looks away

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)

Some hedgehog said bad things about

your company It caused the stock to

plummet and made those bad things

become true
And Jacob now sees the poster that has Gordons attention
It features a pile of money being blown out the window under
the caption that reads If this looks familiar to you
its because youre renting

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
The man you loved like a father threw
himself in front of the uptown five
this morning and you want to bring
that hedgehog to their knees

JACOB
You knew he was dead
Guardian Mortgage Low down payments Adjustable
rates

GORDON GEKKO
Like I said -- I still love to watch
from home

And now Gordon turns to face Jacob with

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
So dont insult me by pretending to
ask for Winnifreds hand when what you
really want to know is who to bring
down to their knees and how to do it
And Jacob swallows that back doesnt argue it

JACOB
I know who

GORDON GEKKO
Really

JACOB
It was either Nassim Tariq from the
Frontier Fund Bretton Woods from
Locust or Karen Molina from ESL

GORDON GEKKO
Does Winnie even know you came to see
me

JACOB
Well not exactly

(THEN)
But Im going to tell her

GORDON GEKKO
Not such a grand idea Pal
Off Jacobs confusion
GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
See I have a feeling youre going to
want to see me again And if you tell
her we had this little pow-wow
shes not going to let that happen
As Jacob considers that the train slows to a stop

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
Look you seem like a smart kid

(BEAT)
Walk away dust off your resume and
get another job

As he steals one last glance at that Guardian Mortgage ad

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
but do it quick
And with that Gordon moves for the doors
But Jacob steps in front of him

JACOB
Im going to bring them down Whoever
floated the rumor for a quick buck

GORDON GEKKO
Its not worth it Its a waste of
energy and time See Jacob nobody
gets it they never did
As the subway doors open

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
If theres one thing I learned in
prison its that money is not the

prime commodity in our lives time

(BEAT)
And your nine minutes are up
And Gordon Gekko gets off the subway leaving Jacob on the

train But right before the doors close Gordon stops and
turns with

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)

There are worse ways to go than
jumping in front of a train For
instance could you imagine taking
something for your diabetes
As the doors close

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
and end up having it cause you to
die of acute pancreatitis

And as the subway pulls out of the station Jacob Moore just
stands there holding the pole and wondering what the hell

that was supposed to mean

EXT ANDREW ZABELS HOME - DAY

Jacob heads for the main house He sees BARBARA ZABEL
Andrews wife sitting next to the some friends

Jacob slowly walks over and when she sees him she
stands wobbly and full of tears

BARBARA
Jacob

Jacob takes her into his embrace

BARBARA (CONTD)
(through her sobs)
You were a son to him
Squeezing her tight fighting back a rush of emotion

JACOB

I was a fucked up kid I was angry my

mother couldnt control me He was

the only one who cared I wouldnt be

anywhere right now if it wasnt for
And Jacob Moore stops short finally breaking down
allowing his own tears to stream down his face

He pulls away

JACOB (CONTD)

If you need anything

She nods
And Jacob moves away from the people and moves across the
lawn But he stops when he sees a woman standing across the
way weve seen pictures of her
Shes in her late-twenties with a natural beauty that might
take two glances to notice But after that second glance
its unforgettable Shes WINNIE GEKKO
As she rushes to him

WINNIE
Jacob Im so sorry
(BEAT)

JACOB

The butler nods then leads Jacob through the full floor unit
and into the

PARLOR

A huge chandelier hangs over the all marble room A
fireplace on one wall and a twelve foot wall of glass
featuring that park view on the other

And Jacob realizes that sonata is live Hes walked into a
recital of some sort

About twenty people sit watching a YOUNG GIRL play on a very
unique looking silver grand piano

The girl cant be a day over thirteen Shes playing
the

ARTIST

Mozarts Ronda Alla Turca her fingers gliding across

keyboard in precision her eyes closed in inspiration Its
as spectacular as it is moving

And BRETTON WOODS

Mid 40s slicing jawline deep set eyes in great shape

And Bretton sighs

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)
The rumors were true

JACOB
You made them true

BRETTON WOODS
No Jacob being levered thirty-eight
to one in toxic debt made them true

(BEAT)
Institutional money-running was
Zabels talent he didnt have a

down year in the last twenty
Jacob just glares at him

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)

His fatal flaw was allowing the
children on his mortgage security desk
to talk him into the deadly game of
hot potato everybodys been so fond of
playing recently

And Jacob holds Brettons look for a moment then

for the door without saying a thing

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)
Come work for me
Jacob stops and turns

JACOB
What

BRETTON WOODS
I run three billion dollars Come
help me run it
And Jacob takes a beat processing this

JACOB
Why me

BRETTON WOODS
Because your loyalty desired revenge
your balls actually attempted it and
your skills pulled it off
As he stands

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)

And as for Andrew Zabel there
really is no telling why he did what
he did

(BEAT)

As far as Im concerned it was just a

heads
bit of money and there are surely
more important things in the world
And Jacob sucks in a deep breath -- containing his anger

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)

Now Im going on Safari with my

family Think about the offer and get

in touch after the July 4th holiday
heading for the door

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)

Bretton smiles

BRETTON WOODS
Excuse me

JACOB
The amount of money you would need to
be able to walk away from it all and
just live happily-ever-after

Everybody has one -- its an exact
number -- whats yours

And Bretton takes a moment to think about that then simply
says

JACOB
So you didnt use me to make a little
money
And never to look up from his lunch

GORDON GEKKO
Naw I prefer to write about the
action now than be apart of it

JACOB
Whyd you give it to me

GORDON GEKKO
Youre out of a job and most likely
going to marry my daughter I
figured you could use the money

JACOB
I didnt make any money off of it

The other man is much bigger and clearly doing the heavy

JP Morgan he single-handedly
stopped the Panic of 1907 by stepping
in and buying up shares in all the
companies that were crashing
Everyone else quickly followed like
lemmings
(re political cartoon)
See -- people had stopped looking to
their government or trusted advisors
They looked to JP Morgan It was all

about simple psychology -- every crash
should have a JP Morgan to step in and
save it

As they walk the hardwood floor

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
See Jacob the best opportunities

are found where angels fear to tread
And they arrive at the next piece on the wall a small
framed bond

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)

Thats a bond issued by the Central
American country of Poyais Gregor
McGregor made a fortune dealing these
to the British elite in 1820

(BEAT)
The country didnt exist
And now Jacob notices a very strange picture across the

room he goes over to look at it

Its very old black and white of a woman filling her

stove with money

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)

Weimer Republic of Germany 1922
Inflation turned to hyper-inflation
and it was more efficient to burn the
money for heat than spend it

JACOB
Thats horrifying

GORDON GEKKO
I know
As they both hold on the picture

JACOB
What caused it

GORDON GEKKO
A country in debt that took on even
more debt to fund a war then
printed mountains of money to avoid a
depression and other financial
imbalances
As he turns to face Jacob

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
sound familiar

JACOB
And you honestly think this is where
were heading
Looking Jacob head on deadly serious

GORDON GEKKO
If we dont take our heads out of the
sand yes Its going to get bad
out there Champ Im not going to
lie Even the small regional bank I
started out at might go under

JACOB
Hudson River Bank

GORDON GEKKO
Thats right
And then

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
And Ive got some news for you he
aint bleeding Hes not even cut

JACOB
What are you talking about

GORDON GEKKO
What Im talking about Jake is
that Id bet dollars to donuts that
Bretton Woods unwound most of his
position in Amlyn last week That he
knew about the pancreatitis
Off of Jacobs confusion

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)

The only reason you think you hurt him
is because he wanted you to think
that

JACOB
How do you know that

GORDON GEKKO
I dont But its not Brettons first
rodeo and my instincts for this
sort of thing dont often disappoint
Jacob cant believe it And with each passing moment of
realization shock turns into rage

JACOB
I cant believe it

GORDON GEKKO
Believe it Princess hes beating
your ass all over the court
As Jacob tries to calm himself

JACOB
And you think I should take the job --
bring him down from the inside
Gordon confirms that with a simple shake of the head and

GORDON GEKKO
I dont know Jake what you kids
think is pay-back these days is really
incredible When I was coming up we
slaughtered men

(BEAT)
There are guys still working at penny
ante brokerages in the Poughkeepsies
of this country because they crossed
me
While Jacob processes that

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
So Ill make you another trade Jake
Ill help you bring him down if you
help me get her back

As Jacob just looks away non committal

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
then you both can have a father

EXT PARK AVENUE - NIGHT
As Jacob walks on the phone with

JACOB

JACOB

ROBBY

Jacob stops walking sucks in a deep breath
JACOB

Im sorry to make you do that
With that he disconnects and shakes his head in
frustration
And after a moment Jacob sucks in a deep breath then makes
another call

JACOB (CONTD)
(into the phone)
Okay Gordon youve got yourself a
trade

FIREWORKS
Exploding over the Capitol building

EXT SENATOR LEHIGHS GEORGETOWN HOME - NIGHT

A BBO for the political set and their families Paper plates
and plastic cups are being thrown away by HELP Children and
parents lay on blankets watching the fireworks

Jacob holds Winnie as they look up at the sky

WINNIE
My parents would always throw this
huge party in the Hamptons on the
fourth The city of South Hampton
would have its firework show at 8pm
then my father would wait until it was

over then put on his which of
course was always twice as
spectacular

She leans up sips her wine then

WINNIE (CONTD)
Then one year the city passed an
ordinance that their firework show had
to be the last of the night they
were sick of getting shown up by
Gordon Gekko
Jacob laughs

JACOB
Whatd he do

WINNIE

He rented a barge and shot the
fireworks off of it a mile off the
coast out of jurisdiction
(then almost to herself)
The show was even more amazing over
the water

And Jacob looks at her

JACOB
I think he should be invited to the
wedding

WINNIE
No

JACOB

Winnie hes your father
As the fireworks explode into their finale

WINNIE
You dont know him

JACOB
I know hes unhappy Look at him out
there trying to scare everybody

Hes desperate for attention

WINNIE
This is none of your business

JACOB
Thats not how this works
Remember
She just looks away

JACOB (CONTD)
Hes got nothing
The firework show ends and everyone applauds

WINNIE

And thats what he deserves

Suddenly everyone begins to look over to the house where
something is happening

WINNIE (CONTD)

The things that came out after he was

convicted The affairs the things

he was recorded saying

SECRET SERVICE PERSONNEL wearing ear pieces start walking
the lawn

WINNIE (CONTD)
This wasnt the man we knew Jacob
It was sociopathic
She stands up and looks across the lawn to where all the
action is

JACOB
It was a long time ago
He stands and kisses her

JACOB (CONTD)
Just consider it okay Thats all
Im asking

She holds his look for a long moment then nodding over
to
all the excitement
WINNIE
Cmon you can meet the next President
of the United States
INT THE LOCUST FUND FOYER - DAY
A massive foyer of black marble with wall to wall views of

her heels clicking as she walks over
SIX FOOT
Jacob are you ready
Jacob stands and she leads him toward a bank of elevators
The doors open and Jacob gets on
INT ELEVATOR - DAY
Jacob stands there with Six Foot
SIX FOOT
Do you have everything they said youd
need
Jacob nods holding a folder of his previous tax forms
his
passport and other documents obviously needed for the job
And the elevator doors open but not to an office
Jacob shields his eyes to the wash of daylight then looks

to realize that hes on the roof of the building
to

INT BRETTON WOODSS CHELSEA HOMETHE BLACK SWAN HOUSE -

The design is much different that Woodss New York CPW

And Jacob is lead into the

DINING ROOM
Where Bretton eats alone at the head of the long table

BRETTON WOODS
Jacob
As Jacob walks through the expansive space

JACOB
Mr Woods
BRETTON WOODS

(Call me)
Bretton
and sits
JACOB
Okay Bretton I thought we were

going to meet in New York

BRETTON WOODS
And I thought you had no interest in
working for a fund that was in
trouble

JACOB
I was emotional I was angry

BRETTON WOODS
And what changed

JACOB
I caught a glance of my portfolio

And Bretton laughs
Jacob notices two huge chocolate brown French Mastiffs
sitting at Brettons feet

JACOB (CONTD)
Cute dogs

BRETTON WOODS
Dogue de Bordeaux bred to kill
But Contango and Backwardation here
are socialized since birth so theyre
harmless
Jacob laughs

JACOB
You named your dogs after technical
futures market terms
And Bretton stands

BRETTON WOODS
Of course not
(with a wink)
My children did
As he heads into

THE LIVING ROOM
A fire burning in the fireplace Jacob follows Bretton in

JACOB
And where are your children
Bretton moves toward a table with a classic phonograph
player
on it

BRETTON WOODS

Greece with my wife My boys are

studying The Iliad now
While Bretton looks through the various sleeves of records
Contango and Backwardation slowly find their way into the
room and sit by the fire
Bretton finds what hes looking for removing the record
from its sleeve

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)

Here it is one of the most
beautiful pieces of music youll ever
hear

Bretton places the record on the phonograph and The Rolling
Stones Let It Loose rings out

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)

Exile On Main Street without a

doubt The Stones greatest album
Jacob laughs He was expecting Beethoven

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)

It was all outtakes Throwaway
tracks And the critics hated it
And it didnt sell well at first

(BEAT)
But now its universally known as
their best release I asked Mick once
how he thought that happened How
something could go from so worthless
to so valuable He just looked at me
and said it never went from
worthless to valuable just the
opinions of it did
Taking a seat

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)
And that was the greatest lesson I
ever learned about investing

JACOB
An assets value can only be priced at
its perception

BRETTON WOODS

(IMPRESSED)
Exactly There is no intrinsic
Then simply

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)

Youll work out of the New York
office I wouldnt want to pull you
away from your fiancee in Washington

JACOB
Thank you

BRETTON WOODS
Shes Gordon Gekkos daughter

JACOB
Thats right

BRETTON WOODS
He was a legend at one time Its
quite sad how he publicly cries out
wolf now
Bretton stands and stretches

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)
You see for a legend

Inside of a tired sigh

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)
the only thing worse than death is
becoming irrelevant
And Bretton just sits there enjoying his scotch while
taking in the Stones tune

GORDON GEKKO (V0O)

Jacob you need to help him get this

And Jacob glares at Bretton like he might kill him

GORDON GEKKO (V0) (CONTD)

But be cautious Your relationship

Bretton looks up and Jacob immediately replaces his glare
with a smile

JACOB
Looks better than meals I get on

BRETTON WOODS
Johns Pizza on Bleeker It crossed
the Atlantic with you yesterday
Would you like a slice
Jacob declines then

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)

I appreciate you wanting to help with

JACOB
Well -- theres a lot I can learn from
you

BRETTON WOODS
For this trip just stay in the
background and observe
As Bretton tosses some pizza to Contango and
Backwardation

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)

Were going to meet with Oleg Bakunin

Looks like a bit of news broke while

we were in the air
And Bretton turns on Fox Business to see footage of The
Governor of New York standing at a podium next to his WIFE
He doesnt look happy as he says

GOVERNOR (ON THE TV)

The remorse I feel will always be with
me Words cannot describe how

grateful I am for the love and
compassion they have shown me From

expected

Jacobs confused Brettons enjoying every second of

BRETTON WOODS
Hes been after us for years

I have been given much -- the love of
my family the faith and trust of the
people of New York and the chance to
lead this state
Laughing with delight

Oh Jacob you dont want to live in

BRETTON WOODS
If he offers you a drink -- take it
And with that Bretton points across the room where OLEG

If he offers you a line of coke --

snort it
Hes in his mid-40s overweight sweaty draped in tight
black Prada and smoking a cigarette

crazy mortgage shit
Bretton just looks away Jacob stays cool

Oleg motions to a WAITRESS who immediately pours vintage
champagne

OLEG (CONTD)

glass of 1927 Heidsiek champagne
Oleg hands Jacob a flute before he can decline

OLEG (CONTD)

As Oleg shakes cocaine out of an envelope

OLEG (CONTD)
You never really know who to trust in
this world
Jacob takes a beat swallows nervously then

JACOB

I couldnt agree more Oleg Its one

of the first things that Andrew Zabel

taught me I worked very closely with

him Its why Bretton hired me To

get behind the Andrew Zabel curtain
Bretton flashes Jacob a look What the hell are you
doing Jacob swallows back some nerves then continues

JACOB (CONTD)
You said before that you always wanted
to invest with Zabel but couldnt
because he only handled institutional
money Well heres your chance
Zabel taught me everything he knew
Oleg looks up to Jacob from the line of coke with interest

OLEG
Such as

JACOB
Well Im not going to give you the
whole cake Oleg
He looks over to Bretton who still glares at Jacob

But I can give you a little bite

It involves building positions in high
yielding stocks new to volatility then
writing calls with split strike

prices
And Oleg regards Jacob for a long moment a jury determining
the verdict Jacob holding on to that sly smile Bretton
looking away playing it cool

Its complicated but like Bretton said

But its gone up so much
sitting at Jacobs computer looking over a chart for

JACOB
I know but if youre going to

PAULINA
I always sell too soon

JACOB
Very common mistake You need to cut
your losers short and let your winners
run
She looks to her friend with a smile

NADIA
Good advice for everything no
Her friend agrees with a laugh And Jacob checks the clock

JACOB
Okay I think enough time has passed

And Jacob finally gets up from his desk goes to the
window looking across midtown Manhattan

GORDON GEKKO (V0) (CONTD)
And then Jacob

eyes pasted on a building made of glass and steela
building he once called home

GORDON GEKKO (V0) (CONTD)

EXT WASHINGTON DC - MORNING

As the sun rises over our nations capital
EXT ROCK CREEK PARK - MORNING

Winnie and Jacob jog the park through the humid July haze
Its very early

And Jacob stops jogging Catches his breath She keeps
running

JACOB
Why are you with me
She stops and turns back to him

WINNIE

JACOB
You hate finance You hate Wall
Street Why are you with me
Winnie nods Its a valid question And she thinks about it
for a moment then

WINNIE
Repetition compulsion

JACOB
Huh

WINNIE
Its Freud

JACOB

And what does it mean psych major

WINNIE
Well its when people repeat the same
dysfunctional relationships from
childhood in their adult life in hopes
of trying to master them

JACOB
Like when children of alcoholics fall
in love with alcoholics

WINNIE
Yeah
He turns away upset
JACOB
Thats great Winnie

WINNIE
Jacob that might be why I was
initially attracted to you but its

not why I love you
She moves to him

WINNIE (CONTD)
I love you because youre
compassionate and you care so deeply
about what you do and you have like no
ego its crazy
She reaches to him turning his face to meet hers

WINNIE (CONTD)
And youre the smartest person Ive

ever met and theres nobody I trust
more in the world
Jacob looks away almost ashamed And Winnie can sense

somethings not right

WINNIE (CONTD)
Whats wrong

JACOB
Nothing
As Jacob draws in a deep breath collects himself and
finally
turns back to her with

JACOB (CONTD)
I just wish you would master that
relationship from childhood so you can
move forward with this one

AND WERE BACK ON THE CHART

And as a circle is formed around August 11th we

cut To

EXT WESTSIDE HIGHWAY- DAY
And Manhattan as it sweats through the heart of summer
Two jetvans ride uptown

INT JETVAN - DAY
As Jacob rides with Bretton

JACOB
Bretton I found something I like
Bretton looks over to him

BRETTON WOODS
Ive been wondering when my new
portfolio manager was going to come to
me with something special

JACOB
I just wanted to make sure I would be
bringing you the smartest idea
possible I know you dont go light
Confirming

BRETTON WOODS
Thats right If I commit to this
we go large and we dont back down

JACOB
It might be better to do this in the
office I have color and support to

PRESENT -—
Waving him off

BRETTON WOODS
Cmon Jacob you know thats not how
we do

EXT ADIRONDACK FOREST PRESERVE - DAY

27 million acres of State protected majestic land All
nature rivers and lakes cypresses and maples Clean
air And trails Many trails that go on for miles

As the two Becker jetvans arrive at a restricted area a
STATE RANGER opens the gate and allows them to drive through
then park
of

Jacob and Bretton emerge from the jetvan

BRETTON WOODS
This is how we do
And with a nod the DRIVER of the other jetvan opens it to
reveal two motorcycles inside Brettons MTT Turbine
Superbike and an Agusta these bikes are handcrafted works

art as much as they are demons of speed
Jacob laughs in disbelief and excitement

JACOB
And were allowed to ride these
through here
Sucking in the fresh summer air

BRETTON WOODS
No

AND JACOB AND BRETTON
Now decked out in leather riding gear on the bikes at
the mouth of the trail revving the engines

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)

Follow me
And with that shoots into the forest Jacob quickly
follows

AND THEY RIDE

Winding through the trees along the side of a river
Bretton riding extremely fast with Jacob trying to keep up
Bretton reaches a clearing and waits for Jacob to catch up
Once he does

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)
Youre going to have to keep up

JACOB
Okay Im just getting used to it

BRETTON WOODS
Tell me your idea

JACOB
Here

BRETTON WOODS
Where else

JACOB
Right Okay

(COLLECTING HIMSELF)
Are you still short any of the
financials

BRETTON WOODS
No After KZI I took profits

JACOB
I think its time to go the other way

BRETTON WOODS
Banks

JACOB
Insurance companies Im talking the
old school insurers that have become
the babies thrown out with the bath
water
Jacob waits for a reaction from Bretton But all he gets
is

BRETTON WOODS

Keep up
And with that Bretton rips into the clearing Jacob rides
just as fast Theyre neck and neck its definitely a
race

Bretton pulls ahead but Jacob doesnt give up

As they move quickly toward a patch of forest with a only
narrow trail entering it Jacob focuses on the horizon and
revs the bike into more speed He pulls up next to Bretton
as they approach the trail

If Jacob doesnt slow down and fall in line behind Bretton
hes going to hit the trees But he doesnt

Instead Jacob blasts the bike into its final dose of speed
narrowly avoiding impact by zipping into the trail

ahead of Bretton and taking the lead

A TRANQUIL LAKE

As it sits still in the setting sun Untouched by man
Bretton and Jacob get off the bikes and walk to the shore
As they catch their breaths and enjoy the beauty

JACOB
The basket of stocks Im putting
together focuses on reinsurance
brokering and management services for
businesses Theyre trading below
book and have large dividends

(BEAT)
I say we buy them here
Bretton thinks about it Hes not sure

BRETTON WOODS
Financials are a falling knife
Jacob nods

JACOB
Im not arguing that but the best
opportunities are found where angels
fear to tread
Jacob can see he has Bretton on the hook

JACOB (CONTD)

So yeah -- they are falling knives
But Bretton
And with confidence driving it home

JACOB (CONTD)
whats life without a little blood
on your hands

On the stage the spotlight finds BILL MAHER and the
applause
breaks out

BILL MAHER
Welcome to the 2008 Financial Follies

(APPLAUDS)
Im Bill Maher and Im getting paid in
Euros
Jacob shares a table with Bretton Brettons wife and a few
other FINANCIAL PLAYERS Winnie is not here

BILL MAHER (CONTD)

When The Financial Writers Association
asked me to host an event for the
world of finance I was shocked Im
known in Washington not Wall Street

(BEAT)
but then they informed me that
Washington is actually in the process
of buying Wall Street so it all makes
sense
Laughter

BILL MAHER (CONTD)
I asked them if anythings off limits
And they said to stay away from the
brokerages banks and insurers
(pause for effect then)
where the fuck was that advice

five months ago

More laughter

BILL MAHER (CONTD)
I see Sammy Rosens here
The spotlight finds SAMMY ROSEN billionaire hedge funder

BILL MAHER (CONTD)
Sammy how are you
From his table

SAMMY ROSEN
Doing well
BILL MAHER
(to the room)
Of course he is in the amount of
time it took for us to have that
exchange he made three hundred and
nine thousand dollars
(back to Sammy)
Sammy let me give you some free
advice the next time someone with bad
eyesight wants to sell you a hundred
and fifty million dollar painting
dont let them personally deliver it

Its an inside joke that this room gets

BILL MAHER (CONTD)
Somebody told me Gordon Gekko is here
Gordon

Across the room a spotlight finds Gordon

BILL MAHER (CONTD)
There you are I have some inside
information for you Gekko sex
sells books not bread lines

Gordon smiles and raises his glass up to Bill

BILL MAHER (CONTD)

Talk about your sour grapes
Seriously Gordon -- just because the
SEC doesnt let you make obscene
amounts of money by being wrong and
nefarious doesnt mean you have to
ruin it for all of these hard working
people

The room applauds

BILL MAHER (CONTD)
Okay we have a video to show now
Its a very detailed and academic
account of the current mortgage
crises Let ‘er rip
And the room goes dark and on the screen plays a
childlike
roughly illustrated stick-figure skit being narrated by
children

FIRST FRAME
Under the caption Main Street National Bank is a drawing

of
a Poor Man sitting across from a Banker Man behind his desk
POOR MAN

named Rich Man sits behind his desk and holds a phone to his
ear

RICH MAN

INT FINANCIAL FOLLIES - LATER

Desert is served Jackets are off cigars are lit Brettons

GEORGE an investment banker at the table thinks about it

GEORGE

The definition of rich flying

private

The table reacts some agree other dont George turns to

Jacob

GEORGE (CONTD)

Jacob What do you think

JACOB
To be rich is to have the love of a
good woman
They all boo

JACOB (CONTD)
(with a smile)
For real I truly believe that
And Jacob turns to Bretton

JACOB (CONTD)
Bretton whats your definition of
rich
An approaching voice answers it for him

VOICE (0S)

To have twice as much money as you
currently do
As he takes a seat

GORDON GEKKO
Isnt that what you always say
Bretton
Then announcing to the table

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
He brings up the question runs it
round the table then finishes with
that Its an old bit

Also announcing to the table

BRETTON WOODS
Be careful Gordon
(looking at Jacob)
your daughters financial health
is in my hands now
Jacob loses his smile suddenly becoming uncomfortable

GORDON GEKKO
Thats right

(BEAT)
And the way The Locust Fund has been
buying up the insurance companies
lately makes me worried about my
future grandchildrens college
educations

JACOB

(TO BRETTON)
I didnt tell him

BRETTON WOODS
No I dont suppose you did
Bretton looks over to Jacob

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)
Go ahead Jacob preach your book
defend your names

And Jacob turns to Gordon

JACOB
We have a proactive central bank the
charts show a clear bottom on July
15th and these companies are trading
at half of what they were six months
ago

GORDON GEKKO
Just cause its low dont make it
cheap Sport

JACOB
I read your book

GORDON GEKKO
Its not out yet

JACOB
I have a friend in publishing

(BEAT)
25 unemployment stagflation
bread lines Martial law
government seizures of assets and
gold end of democracy
Bretton leans back taking in this sparring match

JACOB (CONTD)
Really Gordon Do you really need
attention that badly

GORDON GEKKO
Since I have forty-four seconds to
spare Im going to tell you a story
Its about a guy named Sam
And we go close on Gekko

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
Sam used to work a job he made things
and he grew things and he sold those
things Until one day Sam got a

credit card and was amazed how easy it
was to buy things with it So Sam got
another card and then another Then

he used the credit card money to make

it look like he had an income and
he used that income to secure a
loan

(MORE)

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)

And with that loan Sam bought a fancy
BMW car and rented a fancy penthouse
apartment

(BEAT)
Now the credit cards hit their limit
and the bank needed him to service
that loan so Sam went to his friends
His Chinese friend and his Japanese
friend and his British friend and
so on And his friends loaned Sam
money

(ANOTHER BEAT)

And that brings us to today where

Sam owes the credit cards and Sam owes

the banks and Sam owes his friends and

eventually theyre going to take away

Sams fancy BMW car and his fancy

penthouse apartment
And Jacob can now see in Gordon Gekkos eyes he truly
believes every word hes saying

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)

And Sam doesnt make anything anymore

and Sam doesnt grow anything anymore

so Sam doesnt sell anything anymore
As he stands

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)

Our favorite Uncle Sams desperate
Jake and he just found a printing
press in his basement
(BEAT)
So you tell me -- where do we go from
here
And with that Gordon Gekko goes

BRETTON WOODS

(RE GEKKO)
It is sad isnt it That he cant
just take his ball and go home

(BEAT)
That he has to piss on the whole game

EXT 533 THIRD AVENUE - MORNING

Bretton holds Jacobs look fighting to keep his
composure
Until he simply stands and offers Jacob his desk back

BRETTON WOODS
Then buy more
Jacob takes his chair and reaches for the phone

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)
Cost us down to current levels
Jacob looks up surprised

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)

Its just a question of time before
this turns around right
And he glares at Jacob

JACOB
Right
Bretton just stares nervously at the electronic ticker a
frazzled gambler talking himself into his bet

BRETTON WOODS
Fuck it

As he goes

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)
Leverage is sexy

Jacob gets out of bed and throws on his robe

WINNIE (CONTD)
I was only eight but I could tell he
was worried about something and that
made me worried
(softly almost to herself)
Then the market would go back up and
he would sleep through the night
again

JACOB
Its not the market Winnie
As he sits on the edge of the bed

JACOB (CONTD)
Its just that I havent been able to
sleep through the night since
The thought trails off she leans up and kisses him

WINNIE
I wish I could tell you something was
going to come along that would make it
better but I cant Its just going

After a beat she sees Jacobs wallet

WINNIE

And she stops staring at that picture
Her and her father on that white horse taken years ago

A picture she knows she never gave to Jacob

another brutal wave of selling and

people were now at our lows for

Jacob looks up at ticker on the wall

He stands in the doorway holding a drink

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)

And Bretton CHUCKS the drink against the wall and the glass
shatters Jacob takes a step back

Brettons in a complete state as he walks over to Jacobs
desk and SWIPES it clean papers flying about

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)
Finished

BRETTON WOODS
Face full of sweat blood all over his hand hair strewn
about completely out of breath bloodshot red eyesa

beaten down mess of a man

JACOB
What happened to composure Bretton

BRETTON WOODS
Well I suppose it went to hell with
your fucking insurance stocks
And Bretton calms down walks to the window

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)
Its not making sense to me anymore
The market always made sense to me and

for the most part I was better than
it quicker than it
(MORE)

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)

(BEAT)
But its moving too fast now and it
looks like the world is going to shit
anyway
And he faces Jacob Moore

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)

If I unwind the fund now Ill still

walk with six hundred million or so
And Jacobs face falls this is news to him

JACOB
What

BRETTON WOODS
Its time to call it a day Spend
more time with my family I suppose
this moment comes for all of us

JACOB
You still have six hundred million
Bretton vacantly nods
And Jacob Moore trying his best to hide his
disappointment

JACOB (CONTD)
(almost to himself)
Thats a fortune
With a shrug

BRETTON WOODS
I guess its all relative
Bretton then takes a moment confirming to himself that
this is the right decision then finally looks over to
Jacob with

BRETTON WOODS (CONTD)

to ride off into the fucking sunset

GORDON GEKKO

Okay

JACOB
No its not okay because were so
fucking close and hes going to

walk with six hundred million dollars
and thats unacceptable
And Gordon sighs in defeat

GORDON GEKKO
I dont know what to tell you Pal
You wanted to make him bleed I wanted
my daughter back
As he walks

GORDON GEKKO (CONTD)
looks like life brings
disappointment to us all
And Jacob as he matches Gordons stride in a complete
state

JACOB
What happened to slaughtering men
Gordon What happened to turning them
into penny-ante brokers in
Poughkeepsie
Gordon stops walking

GORDON GEKKO

Look at you This cant possibly be
the man my daughter fell in love with
Jacob turns away

JACOB
I want to finish the job

GORDON GEKKO
Why

JACOB
Because nobody gave a shit about me
before Andrew Zabel came along
Because he didnt deserve what he got
GORDON GEKKO
The universe is an efficient market
Kid we all get what we deserve

JACOB
Did you
Now its Gordon who looks away

GORDON GEKKO
I know you cared about him and I
know how that motivates But Jacob
he wasnt such a Saint

And with that Gordon Gekko heads on his way

JACOB
Whats that supposed to mean

GORDON GEKKO
You dont want to know

Jacob steps forward shouting out after him

revenge he saw his window
Upset she looks for her keys

I have to go to work

JACOB

Bretton owed him a favor because he

fed your father information twenty

three years ago when he was a young

broker in London and your father never

ratted him out

She just looks at him shaking her head and not in
disapproval but in pity But he keeps going

JACOB (CONTD)
And he never put the money into
Brettons fund Turns out your trust
had built up a controlling position in
Hudson River Bank

WINNIE
Thats the bank he worked at when I
was born
on

Well now he owns it Or shall I say
pilfered it before he went AWOL

billion dollar airplane by the seat of

half of the fucking money is going

they want this out there

kills every trade

See Jacob -- the hustle we all fall
for is actually thinking we can fight
whats inherent whats inevitable
that we can somehow undo what
genetics or God or whatever name you

revenge or the compulsion to chase

it all amounts to the same thing

loss of control And its always
