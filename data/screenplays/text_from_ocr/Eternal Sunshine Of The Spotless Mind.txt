Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind by Charlie Kaufman

INT PUBLISHING HOUSE RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Its grand and modern Random House-Knopf-Taschen is etched
on the wall in large gold letters An old woman enters
carrying a tattered manuscript maybe a thousand pages She
seems haunted hollow-eyed sickly The young receptionist
dressed in a shiny stretchy one-piece pantsuit looks up

RECEPTIONIST
Oh hi

OLD WOMAN

(apologetically)
Hi I was in the neighborhood and thought
Id see --

RECEPTIONIST

I think hes in a conference
Unfortunately Im really sorry

OLD WOMAN
Would you just try him You never know
As long as Im here You never know

RECEPTIONIST
Of course Please have a seat

The old woman smiles and sits the bulky manuscript on her
lap She stares politely straight ahead

RECEPTIONIST (CONTD)
(quietly into headset)

Its her -- I know but couldnt you just
-- Yes I know but -- I know but shes
old and it would be a nice -- Yes sorry

(to old woman)
Im sorry maam hes not in right now
Its a crazy time of year for us

The receptionist gestures toward a Christmas tree in the
corner Its ornaments are holograms

OLD WOMAN
This book -- Its essential that people
read it because --
(gravely patting the
manuscript)
-- Its the truth And only I know it

RECEPTIONIST
(nodding sympathetically)
Maybe after the holidays then
INT TILED HALLWAY - DAY

The old woman carries her manuscript haltingly down a subway
hall She stops to catch her breath then continues and
passes several archway with letters printed above them When
she arrives at one topped by an LL she slips a card in a
slot A plastic molded chair drops into the archway She
sits in the chair it rises

INT TUBE -DAY

The woman is still in the chair as it slips gracefully into a
line of chairs shooting through a glass tube The other
chairs are peopled with commuters We stay with the woman as
she and the others travel over New York City in the tube
There are hundreds of these commuter tubes crisscrossing the
skyline The woman glances at the manuscript in her lap
Its called

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
This serves as the movies opening title The other credits

follow as the old woman studies commuters in passing tubes
Their faces are variously harsh and sad and lonely and blank

INT WAITING ROOM - DAY

Mierzwiak steps out from behind his desk
MIERZWIAK

Clementine enters the office Mary smiles at Mierzwiak and
closes the door leaving them alone

INT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Mierzwiak directs Clementine to a chair next to a coffee
table and a conspicuously placed box of tissues Mierzwiak
sits across from her He smiles

MIERZWIAK
How are you today

CLEMENT INE
Okay I guess

MIERZWIAK

(nodding sympathetically)
Well why dont you tell me whats going

He indicates a tape recorder

CLEMENT INE
I dont care

He turns it on smiles at her gestures for her to begin

CLEMENTINE (CONTD)
Well Ive been having a bad time of it
with um my boyfriend I guess

MIERZWIAK
You guess hes your boyfriend Or you
guess youre having a bad time with hm

CLEMENT INE
What No I dont like the term
boyfriend Its so gay

Mierzwiak nods Hes attentive pleasant and neutral
throughout

CLEMENTINE (CONTD)
Maybe gay isnt the right word But
anyway its been rough with him
whatever the fuck he is Heheh My

significant other heh heh And I
guess on a certain level I want to break
it off but I feel yknow its like

this constant questioning and re
questioning Do I end it Should I give
it more time Im not happy but what do
I expect Relationships require work
You know the drill The thing that I
keep coming back to is Im not getting
any younger I want to have a baby at
some point maybe right So then I
think I should settle -- which is not
necessarily the best word -- I mean hes
a good guy Its not really settling
Then I think maybe Im just a victim of
movies yknow That I have some
completely unrealistic notion of what a
relationship can be But then I think
no this is what I really want so I
should allow myself the freedom to go out
and fucking find it You know Agreed
But then I think he is a good guy and
Its complicated Yknow

MIERZWIAK
I think I know I think we can help Why
dont you start by telling me about your
relationship Everything you can think
of Everything about him Everything
about you And well take it from there

She nods thinks

CLEMENT INE
Um well hes a fucking tidy one --

EXT COMMUTER TRAIN STATION
SUBTITLE TWO WEEKS LATER

The platform is crowded with business commuters Joel is
among them He is in his 30s gaunt and holding a
briefcase The platform across the tracks from him is empty
Suddenly he turns and makes his way through the crowd He
climbs the stairs crosses the overpass to the empty
platform Soon an almost empty train pulls up to that
platform Joel gets on and watches the business commuters
through the dirty window as his train pulls out of the
station

EXT MONTAUK TRAIN STATION - LATER

Joel talks on a phone The wind howls around him He tries
to shield the mouthpiece as he talks

JOEL
Hi Cindy Joel Listen Im not
feeling well this morning No Food
poisoning I think Sorry it took me so
long to call in but Ive been vomiting

EXT BEACH - DAY

Joel wanders the windy empty beach with his briefcase He
passes an old man with a metal detector They nod at each
other
Later Joel looks out at the ocean

Later Joel sits on a rock and pulls out a notebook He
opens it and writes with a gloved hand

JOEL
January 13th 2006 Today I skipped work
and took the train out to Montauk

(thinks)
Its cold

(thinks some more)
The sky is gray

(thinks some more)
I dont know what else to say Nothing
happens Nothing changes I saw Naomi
last night We had sex It was weird to
fall into our old familiar sex life so
easily Like no time has passed After
two years apart suddenly were talking
about getting together again I guess
thats good

He has no other thoughts He glances up spots a female
figure in the distance walking in his direction She stands
out against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded
sweatshirt Its Clementine He watches her for a bit then
as she nears he goes back to his writing or at least
pretends to Once she passed he watches her walk away She
stops and stares out at the ocean Joel writes

JOEL (VO) (CONTD)
If Im constitutionally incapable of
making eye-contact with a woman I dont
know I guess Id better get back to
Naomi

Later Joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the
season He peeks cautiously in a dark window

Later Joel digs into the sand with a stick
INT DINER - DAY

Its a local tourist place but off-season empty Joel sits
in a booth and eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of
tomato soup An elderly couple drink coffee at the counter
Clementine enters looks around takes off her hood Joel
glances at her bright blue hair She picks an empty booth
and sits Joel studies her discreetly The waitress
approaches her with a coffee pot

WAITRESS
Coffee

CLEMENTINE
God yes Youve saved my life
The waitress pours the coffee

WAITRESS
You know what you want yet

CLEMENT INE
(laughing)
Aint that the question of the century

The waitress is not amused

CLEMENTINE (CONTD)

The waitress heads to the grill Clementine fishes in her
bag brings the coffee cup under the table for a moment
pours something in then brings the cup back up

CLEMENT INE
(calling)
And some cream please

Clementine looks around the place Her eyes meet Joels
before he is able to look away She smiles vaguely He
looks embarrassed then down at his journal Clementine
pulls a book from her purse and starts to read Joel glances
up tries to see the cover Its blue He cant read the
title

EXT BEACH - DAY

Joel stares out at the ocean Far down the beach Clementine
stares at it too Joel glances sideways at her then back at
the ocean

EXT MONTAUK TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON

enters the platform sees Joel the only other person there
She waves sort of goofily enthusiastic playing as if
theyre old friends He waves back embarrassed She takes
a seat on a bench far down the platform Joel stares at his
hands pulls out his journal and tries to write in order to
conceal his awkwardness

INT TRAIN - A BIT LATER

Joel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the
slowly passing desolate terrain After a moment the door
between cars opens and Clementine enters Joel looks up
Clementine is not looking at him she busies herself deciding
where to sit She settles on a seat at the opposite end of
the car Joel looks out the window He feels her watching
him The train is picking up speed Finally

The conductor enters the car

CONDUCTOR

CLEMENTINE
What is nice anyway I mean besides an

The conductor turns to Clementine She fishes in her bag

pandering Cowardly

CLEMENTINE (CONTD)

INT CLEMENTINES APARTMENT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Joel stands in the living room somewhat nervously He tries
to calm himself by focusing on the surroundings He looks at
the books on her shelves Clementine is in the kitchen We

see her as she passes by the doorway several times preparing
drinks and chatting

CLEMENT INE
Thanks I like it too Been here about
four years Its really cheap My
downstairs neighbor is old so shes
quiet which is great And the
landlords sweet which is bizarre but
great and I have a little porch in the
back which is great because I can read
there and listen to my crickets and

Clementine is in the living room now with two gin and tonics

CLEMENTINE (CONTD)
Two blue ruins

Joel is looking at a framed black and white photograph of
crows flying

CLEMENTINE (CONTD)
You like that

JOEL
Very much
CLEMENT INE
This someone gave that to me just
like recently I like it too I like
crows I think I used to be a crow

She caws and hands Joel a drink

Reincarnation

JOEL

(takes it off the wall reads)
The way a crowShook down on meThe dust
of snowFrom a hemlock treeHas given my
heartA change of moodAnd saved some
partOf a day I rued

JOEL
Frost

CLEMENT INE

(impressed)
Yeah Im not like a Robert Frost
lover by any stretch His stuff seems
strictly grade school to me But this
made me cry for some reason Maybe
because it is grade school Yknow

JOEL
Its pretty

CLEMENT INE
I miss grade school I dont know why
Im calling it grade school all of a
sudden When I went we called it
elementary school But I like grade
school better Sounds like something
someone from the forties would call it
Id like to be from then Everyone wore
hats Anyway cheers

JOEL
Cheers

They click glasses

Clementine giggles and takes a big gulp

of her drink Joel sips She plops down on the couch and

pulls her boots off
CLEMENT INE
God that feels so fucking good Take
yours off

JOEL
Im fine

CLEMENT INE
Yeah Well have a seat anyway

Joel sits in a chair across the room Clementine finishes
her drink

CLEMENTINE (CONTD)
Ready for another

JOEL
No Im okay for now

She heads toward the kitchen with her glass

CLEMENT INE
Well Im ready Put some music on

Joel crosses to the CDs and studies them

JOEL
What do you want to hear

CLEMENTINE (0S)
You pick it

JOEL
You just say Im not really --

CLEMENTINE (0S)
I dont know I cant see them from
here Joel Just pick something good

Joel studies the unfamiliar CDs He picks up Bang On a Can
performing Brian Enos Music for Airports to look at
Clementine reenters with her drink

CLEMENTINE (CONTD)
Oh excellent choice

She grabs it and sticks it in the CD player The music is
dreamy and haunting and slow Clementine falls back onto the
couch closes her eyes and sips her drink

CLEMENTINE (CONTD)
Mmmmmmm Way to go Joel You pick
good

Joel sits down in his chair and drinks Theres a silence
which seems fine to Clementine but makes Joel anxious
JOEL
Well I should probably get going

CLEMENT INE
No stay Just for a little while
(opens her eyes brightly)
Refill

JOEL
No I --

CLEMENT INE
I know a man who needs a refill

She grabs Joels drink from his hand takes it into the
kitchen

CLEMENTINE (CONTD) (O0S) (CONTD)
God bless alcohol is what I say Where
would I be without it Oh Jesus Mary
and Joseph maybe I dont want to think
about that

She giggles Joel looks around the room again There are
several potatoes dressed as women in beautiful handmade
costumes a nurse potato a stripper potato a schoolteacher
potato a housewife potato Clementine returns with Joels
drink and a refill for herself

JOEL
Thanks

CLEMENT INE
Drink up young man Itll make the
whole seduction part less repugnant

Joel looks a little alarmed

CLEMENTINE (CONTD)
Im just kidding Cmon

She sits back on the couch closes her eyes Joel watches
her looks at her breasts She opens her eyes smiles
drunkenly at him

CLEMENTINE (CONTD)
Yknow Im sort of psychic

JOEL
Yeah

CLEMENT INE
Well I go to a psychic and shes always
telling me Im psychic She should know
Do you believe in that stuff

JOEL
I dont know

CLEMENT INE
Me neither But sometimes I have
premonitions so I dont know Maybe
thats just coincidence Right Yknow
you think something and then it happens
or you think a word and then someone says
it Yknow

JOEL
Yeah I dont know Its hard to know

CLEMENT INE
Exactly Exactly Thats exactly my
feeling about it Its hard to know
Like okay but how many times do I think
something and it doesnt happen Thats
what youre saying right You forget
about those times Right

JOEL
Yeah I guess

CLEMENT INE
(dreamy beat)
But I think I am I like to think I am

CLEMENTINE (CONTD)
Its helpful to think theres some order
to things Youre kind of closed
mouthed arent you

JOEL
Sorry My life isnt that interesting
I go to work I go home I dont know
what to say

CLEMENT INE
Oh

(considers this)
Does that make you sad Or anxious Im
always anxious thinking Im not living my
life to the fullest yknow Taking
advantage of every possibility Just
making sure that Im not wasting one
second of the little time I have

JOEL
I think about that

She looks at him really hard for a long moment Joel tries
to hold her gaze but cant He looks down at his drink
Clementine starts to cry again

CLEMENT INE
Youre really nice Im sorry I yelled
at you before about it God Im an
idiot

JOEL
I do have a tendency to use that word too
much

CLEMENT INE
I like you Thats the thing about my
psychic thing I think thats my
greatest psychic power that I get a
sense about people My problem is I
never trust it But I get it And with
you I get that youre a really good guy

JOEL
Thanks

CLEMENT INE
And anyway you sell yourself short I
can tell Theres a lot of stuff going
on in your brain I can tell My

goal can I tell you my goal
JOEL

Yeah
CLEMENT INE

(ala Paul Simon)
Whats the goal Joel

(laughs)
My goal Joel is to just let it flow
through me Do you know what I mean
Its like theres all these emotions and
ideas and they come quick and they change
and they leave and they come back in a
different form and I think were all
taught we should be consistent Yknow
You love someone -- thats it Forever
You choose to do something with your life
-- thats it thats what you do Its a
sign of maturity to stick with that and
see things through And my feeling is
thats how you die because you stop
listening to what is true and what is
true is constantly changing You know

JOEL
Yeah I think so Its hard to --

CLEMENT INE
Like I wanted to talk to you I didnt
need any more reason to do it Who knows
what bigger cosmic reason might exist

JOEL
Yeah
CLEMENTINE

Youre very nice God I have to stop
saying that Youre nervous around me

huh

JOEL
No

CLEMENT INE
Im nervous You dont need to be

nervous around me though I like you

Do you think Im repulsively fat

JOEL
No not at all

CLEMENT INE
I dont either I used to But Im

through with that Yknow if I dont
love my body then Im just lost You

know

CLEMENTINE (CONTD)

With all the wrinkles and scars and the

general falling apart thats coming
round the bend

(beat)
So Ive been seeing this guy

Joel looks slightly crestfallen

CLEMENTINE (CONTD)
(off his reaction)

Well for the last week anyway Hes

kind of a kid Kind of a goofball
hes really stuck on me which is
flattering Who wouldnt like that
hes like a dope but he says these

smart and moving things sometimes out of

nowhere that just break my heart

the one who gave me that crow photograph

JOEL
Oh yeah

CLEMENTINE

That made me cry But anyway we went
up to Boston because I had this urge to

lie on my back on the Charles River
gets frozen this time of year

JOEL
Thats scary sounding

CLEMENTINE

Exactly I used to do it in college and
I had this urge to go do it again so I
got Patrick and we drove all night to get
there and he was sweet and said nice
things to me but I was really
disappointment to be there with him
Yknow And thats where psychic stuff
comes in Like it just isnt right with
him Yknow

She scribbles her phone number hands it to him He puts it
in his pocket He stands there uncomfortably for a moment
then forces himself to speak

JOEL (CONTD)
I dont think your personality comes out
of a tube I think the hair is just a

She tears up swallows and kisses him on the cheek Hes
surprised and pleased and nervous

the snow and getting in his car

INT JOELS CAR - NIGHT

Joel speeds through the suburban Rockville Center
neighborhood There is no snow on the ground He seems
different somehow foggy and disoriented

SUBTITLE THREE DAYS EARLIER
He arrives at his apartment building and parks
EXT JOELS APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Joel gets out of his car spots a van parked across the
street There are two dark figures inside

VOICE-OVER
Them
He hurries inside the building
INT JOELS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel enters dumps his overcoat on a chair turns off the
lights crosses to look furtively out the window Its
snowing in large flakes which seem to fall only in the beam
of a streetlight

JOEL
It was snowing

VOICE-OVER
There are two of them Couldnt make
them out The orange glow of a
cigarette

Joel squints to see inside the van Two dark figures talk
One sucks on a cigarette and s dim orange light momentarily
illuminates the interior The figure in the driver seat
rolls down his window and gives a cheery wave to Joel

JOEL
The driver waved So casual friendly

VOICE-OVER
Im like a joke to them

Joel pulls away from the window his face blanched

VOICE-OVER
I guess they figure they can act like
they want They dont have to worry
about me remembering

He paces mulling things over As he does the scene starts
to change almost as if it is drying out

JOEL
I might be making a mistake

VOICE-OVER
Maybe Im making a mistake Maybe I just
need to learn to live with this First
of all Ill get over it Secondly it
happened Those who do not remember
history are condemned to repeat it Who
said that Churchill Im not sure
But I dont care She did it to me I
have to rid myself of this Fuck her

JOEL
Fuck you Clementine

The colors bleach the surroundings become slightly vague
Even Joels persona and voice-over seem to alter his
emotional intensity becoming diffused Joel does not seem
aware of this He stops pacing takes a small vial from his
pocket dumps the lone pill onto his palm He looks at it
Its pink Theres some illegible initials stamped on it

JOEL (CONTD)
Pink

(beat)
There was a number on it I remember
AL 1718

(beat)
I have to follow through with this I
have no choice

VOICE-OVER
The pill was pink I remember It had
some letters and numbers on it What
were they AL 1718 AL something Four
digits I dont like taking pills when I
dont know what they are I have no
choice

He swallows it peeks out the window again takes off his
clothes slips into a pair of pajamas fresh from the store
packaging He sits on the edge of the bed dials the phone

JOEL (CONTD)
Were sorry the number you have
dialed

(beat)
Screw you Clementine for doing this

RECORDED VOICE
Were sorry the number you have dialed
is no longer in service If you think
you have reached this recording in error

JOEL (CONTD)
Bye
Joel hangs up and lies on his back on the bed By now the
scene is lifeless almost a husk He hears the apartment

building door open He hears footsteps

JOEL (CONTD)
Its them

VOICE-OVER
Its too late

His eyelids are getting heavy He closes his eyes
BLACK

He hears a key in his apartment door
JOEL (CONTD)
Fuck

INT BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

Joel sits in the bookstore coffee shop Its a jarring
transition visually and emotionally Joel is in the midst
of some traumatic state of mind

He fingers the vial with the pink pill in it as he watches
Clementine stack books on shelves Her hair is bright orange
now

JOEL
I should maybe talk to you

VOICE-OVER
Clementine I should just maybe talk to

her

Joel rises and heads toward Clementine

JOEL
I love you and if you knew that if I
told you what happened Ill explain

everything what we meant to each other
Ill tell you everything about our time
together Youll know everything again
and

VOICE-OVER
Maybe if I just explain what happened I
wouldnt have to go through this and I
could tell you everything and it would be
like you knew and we could rebuild and we
could be happy again and

Right before Joel gets there Patrick a skinny young man
approaches Clementine Joel stops watches The young man
seems out of breath He glances over at Joel then taps
Clementine on the shoulder She turns annoyed sees who it
is and her face lights up

JOEL
Clementine

VOICE-OVER
Thats your look for me

Clementine giggles stands and pokes Patrick playfully in the
ribs

PATRICK
I just thought Id say hi I was in the
neighborhood

CLEMENT INE
You were not
PATRICK
I was not

Joel is mesmerized by their familiarity As he stands there
the scene starts to dry out

Clementine and Patrick continue their flirtation but its
turning lifeless as if they are just reciting lines The
bookstore start to lose its color and immediacy

CLEMENT INE
Come over after Im done here

PATRICK
IT cant I want to but I have to study

CLEMENT INE
You rat

PATRICK
I really want to but tonights

JOEL
How could she have done this to me How

CLEMENT INE
(to Patrick)
You didnt say anything about my hair

PATRICK
Its so cool Youre by far the most
sensational person in the room

CLEMENT INE
In the room

PATRICK
In the world

Joel seems dazed in some sort of dream confusion as he
realizes the world around him is looking increasingly odd

JOEL
Whats happening here

(looks at watch its 930
Oh God I have to go home Theyll be
there soon

Joel turns to leave
INT JOELS CAR - NIGHT

Joel drives fast recklessly The intensity is back Hes
weeping as he drives
JOEL
Gotta get home How could she do this to
me
How could she not care about what we
meant to each other What a fuck What
a fucking monster she is

VOICE-OVER
Oh God I miss her I cant believe
shes with that guy now Im never going
to see her again I love her so much
What a fucking monster she is

The scene is faded as he parks in front of his apartment
building and gets out of the car Joel spots the parked
van Weve seen this before but its dried out now

JOEL
Them

EXT NEW YORK STREET - DAY

Joel trudges along carrying two big trash bags full of stuff
Hes been crying He looks behind him and finds himself
looking out the window of his apartment at the dark van on
the snowy street He turns back to the New York Street and
spots the address he was looking for 610 11th Avenue

INT WAITING ROOM - DAY

Joel sits in the small room with his bags A woman across
from him cradles a box full of belongings in her lap Her
eyes are red from crying Mary the receptionist pokes her
head through her window into the waiting room

MARY
Hello again Mr Barish Good youve

MARY

INT LABORATORY - DAY

Joel enters Mierzwiak stands there with Stan in his lab
coat

MIERZWIAK
Ah Mr Barish This is Stan Hell be
in charge of your procedure tonight
Stan nods professionally

STAN
Mr Barish

JOEL

How exactly is this going to work
tonight

As Mierzwiak talks the room colors start to fade
Mierzwiaks tone of voice is also affected it becomes dry
and monotonous

MIERZWIAK
Well start with your most recent
memories and go backwards -- There is an

emotional core to each of our memories --
As we eradicate this core it starts its
degradation process -- By the time you
wake up in the morning all memories
weve targeted will have withered and
disappeared Like a dream upon waking

JOEL
Is there any sort of risk of brain
damage

MIERZWIAK
Well technically the procedure itself
is brain damage but on a par with a
night of heavy drinking Nothing youll
miss

Joel looks quizzically at the eroding environment Suddenly
he gets it

JOEL
Its happening now Im already in my
brain

Mierzwiak looks at the fading room

MIERZWIAK
Yes I suppose you are
(back in his faded memory
persona)
So lets get started -- If we want the
procedure underway tonight we have some
work to do

Joel is sitting in a chair Electrodes connect him to some
electronic machinery monitored by Stan Mierzwiak watches
from the corner

STAN
We use the articles you brought to create
a map of Clementine in your brain
Tonight while you sleep well be able to
trace the map and erase

JOEL
But youre tracing and erasing now Its
already started Im home in my bed

Stan pulls a snow globe from one of Joels bags shows it to
Joel The equipment registers Joels reaction

STAN
Very good

Stan pulls out a potato dressed as a Vegas showgirl Joel
studies it The machines register his response

MIERZWIAK
Well dispose of these mementos when
were done here That way you wont be
confused later by their unexplainable
presence in your home

Stan pulls out a coffee mug with a photo of Clementine
printed on it Joel looks at the cup The machines record
his reaction

STAN
Good Were getting healthy read-outs

The room Stan and Mierzwiak are now vague and wispy

STANS VOICE
Patrick do me a favor --

Joel is watching Stan Stan is not speaking yet his voice
continues

STANS VOICE (CONTD)
-- and check the voltage levels Im not
wiping as clean as I would like here

Joel looks up Stans voice seems to be coming from above
INT JOELS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Joel lies on his back in fresh pajamas His eyes are closed
and electrodes connect his head to several machines The
machines are operated by Stan now in grubby street clothes
and in need of a shave and by Patrick dressed similarly
The monitor on one of the machines traces a myriad of light
blips running like streams through an image of Joels brain
Stan presses buttons and operates a joystick aiming for the
lines Patrick (who we saw earlier with Clementine at the
bookstore) studies a meter on one of the machines

PATRICK
The voltage looks fine

STAN
Then check the connections

Patrick fiddles with some jacks

PATRICK
Does that help

STAN
Yeah that looks better Thanks

INT LAB ROOM - DAY

The memory is becoming vague characters affects flat Stan
pulls out a pile of loose-leaf pages Mierzwiak smiles

MIERZWIAK
Ah your journal This will be
invaluable

STAN

(reading)
December 15th 2004 I met someone

tonight Oh Christ I dont know what
to do Her name is Clementine and shes
amazing So alive and spontaneous and
passionate and sensitive Things with
Naomi and I have been stagnant for so
long

The scene is just a shell of itself as Stan rattles on

STANS VOICE
I think we got this one Lets push on

Joel looks up at the ceiling

INT JOELS APARTMENT - DAY

Joel snapped into a new memory cries as he fills two large
plastic garbage bags with mementos of his relationship with
Clementine There are funny little gifts wind-up toys some
potatoes dressed as women some clothing Clementine has left
there some CDs He pulls a big clump of pages out of his
loose-leaf journal and dumps them in the bag

He gets some clean loose-leaf paper and writes

December 15 2004 Nothing much happened today I stayed
home Naomi worked on her dissertation

The scene is fading as he continues to write

moment He glances at the unconscious Joel

Since I was a

this part where the skin Horse tells the
rabbit what it means to be real

(crying)

I cant believe Im crying already He
says It takes a long time Thats why

it doesnt often happen

to people who

break easily or have sharp edges or who
have to be carefully kept Generally by
the time you are Real most of your hair

has been loved off and

your eyes drop

out and you get loose in the joints and

very shabby But these

things dont

matter at all because once you are Real
you cant be ugly except to people who

dont understand

helping all these people You didnt
come on to me at all I liked that I
was tongue-tied around you at first I
wanted you to think I was smart You
were so nice I loved the way you
smelled I couldnt wait to come to
work I had these fantasies of us being
married and having kids and just
(starts to cry)

»-and so then when

Naomi

VOICE-OVER
On the couch Dark Quiet I wondered
if I had made a terrible mistake I
almost reached for the phone about a
thousand times I thought I could take
it back erase it explain I had
momentarily lost my mind Then I told
myself we werent happy That was the
truth That what we were was safe
It was unfair to you and to me to stay in
a relationship for that reason I
thought about Clementine and the spark
when I was with her but then I thought
what you and I had was real and adult and
therefore significant even if it wasnt
much fun But I wanted fun I saw
other people having fun and I wanted it
Then I thought fun is a lie that no one
is really having fun Im being suckered
by advertising and movie bullshit then
I thought maybe not maybe not And then
I thought as I always do at this point
in my argument about dying
