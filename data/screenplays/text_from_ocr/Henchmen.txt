FADE IN

EXT BUDDHIST MONASTERY — NIGHT

Snow swirls around a Buddhist monastery clinging to a sheer
cliff in the Himalayan mountains Several HENCHMEN in red
jumpsuits patrol the terraces of the monastery

Title Bagmati District Nepal

EXT MONASTERY ENTRANCE — NIGHT

An old SHERPA approaches the entrance on a yak Two HENCHMEN
standing guard seem unconcerned The Sherpa dismounts
motioning for the guards to approach

In a flash the Sherpa KNOCKS the two guards out and just as
smoothly pulls off his disguise - AGENT SHARP He is
dashing svelte vaguely British and all business

INT BUDDHIST MONASTERY — NIGHT

The cavernous interior of the monastery is completely
modernized Dozens of HENCHMEN in red jumpsuits SCURRY around
industrial catwalks and everywhere hums with hi-tech
equipment The center of the space is dominated by a MASSIVE
ROCKET pointed at an opening in the ceiling

Agent Sharp appears from the shadows deftly avoiding
detection He crosses to the rocket and begins to unscrew a
metal panel at the base of the weapon

CHAANG (0S)
Agent Aaron Sharp

Sharp FREEZES Standing behind him is CHAANG an elderly
villain dressed in the red robe of a Buddhist monk Sharp
turns just as two HENCHMEN take hold of each arm

SHARP
Chaang

CHAANG
So predictable really

SHARP
I love what you’ve done with the
place Pity I have to destroy it

Chaang falls into a laughing fit that lasts a beat too long
HENCHMEN 2

CHAANG
Oh Agent Sharp Always the
optimist In a way I am glad
youve come You more than anyone
here will appreciate what I’m
about to accomplish

Chaang and Agent Sharp continue to trade barbs but our
attention drifts to a catwalk above them

SHARP (0S)
Destroying the United Nations What
will that give you

CHAANG (0S)
Control Agent Sharp World
domination Power

(beat)
And money

On the catwalk two HENCHMEN stand guard in red jumpsuits
One is a bit disheveled hair longer than regulation
jumpsuit unzipped to his chest He is not terribly alert in
fact he’s bored Meet GUY - our hero Sort of

GUY
Hey

The other henchman does not respond

GUY
Hey You got any gum I’m parched

The other henchman continues to ignore him Guy studies the
monastery architecture

GUY

You know these retrofit jobs never
really get a handle on climate
control No one wants to take the
time with the duct work

(beat)
I’m dying up here Have you been
called for lunch yet It’s been
hours I’d pack an energy bar if
this jumpsuit had any pockets

HENCHMAN 1
Do you mind I’m trying to
concentrate

GUY
On what
HENCHMEN 3

HENCHMAN 2 (0S)
Hey

Guy turns to see another henchman halfway down the catwalk

HENCHMAN 2
Would you two keep it down

GUY
Was I talking to you

HENCHMAN 2
We’ve got an agent down there The
place could be crawling with them

GUY
Take it easy Besides when do they
ever send more than one

Guy turns back to Henchman 1 shaking his head

GUY
Can you believe that guy

Before he can answer an EXPLOSION rocks the catwalk Down
below Agent Sharp has freed himself from his captors and
somehow caused the laser cannon to begin to self-destruct

FEMALE VOICE (0S)
Facility self-destruct in five
minutes

HENCHMEN scurry around the facility as the monastery begins
to slowly crumble Guy seems unconcerned

GUY
I have got to meet the girl who
does the voice over for these guys

Guy turns just as Henchman 1 begins to unload his MAC-10
onto the floor below

GUY
What are you doing It’s evac time
Look everybody else is running
around in a chaotic manner It’s
what we do

At that moment Henchman 1 catches a bullet in the chest and
FALLS from the catwalk leaving Guy standing alone

GUY
(shaking his head)
Rookie
HENCHMEN 4

EXT BUDDHIST MONASTERY - NIGHT

Guy LANDS HARD in the snow and begins to slide down the slope
as the monastery EXPLODES behind him He SLAMS into a snow
bank as debris rains down around him

Guy recovers just in time to see Agent Sharp SPEED past on a
hi-tech snow mobile - a beautiful Nepalese WOMAN clinging to
his waist Sharp SKIDS to a stop and surveys the destruction

AGENT SHARP
That’s the end of Chaang

WOMAN
Oh Aaron

Sharp and the woman linger over a KISS then speed off down
the mountain Guy watches them go then scans the horizon

GUY
Looks like I’m walking

INTEXT UNKOWN LOCATION - DAY

Were tight on a pair of EYES squinting in focused intensity
As we slowly pull back instrumental music builds adding to
the sense of impending danger Behind this mysterious man we
see the blurred outlines of a jungle as he straps a headband
around his crew cut Meet MAX - also our hero Sort of

We pull back further to see

INT MAX’S OFFICE - DAY

We are in a DRAB office The “jungle” is a poster of a monkey
hanging from a branch Hang on Friday’s coming

Max raises a set of NUMCHUCKS to his face and kisses them as
the music abruptly stops

DJ (0S)
Let’s keep the jazz flowing Here’s
Sade with Smooth Operator

Sade starts singing as Max begins a FURIOUS routine with his
weapon Just as he reaches a fever pitch of low grunts and
flying numchucks there is a knock at the door and PETE a
nervous 15 year-old high school student pushes in

PETE
Mr Simon
HENCHMEN 5

Max loses all concentration and the business end of the
numchucks SLAMS into his GROIN

INT MAX’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Max is sitting at his desk across from Pete A small placard
reads “MAX SIMON - GUIDANCE COUNSELOR” On Max’s desk sits a
stack of Agency Entrance Exam review booklets and several
self help titles The most prominent title is Teaching You to
Love You next to a small bear holding a tiny chalk board that
reads “Be yourself Everyone else is taken”

PETE
I’m just not sure if I’m really cut
out for band

MAX
Listen Pete high school like
life is short And your dream is
like a ticking time bomb

PETE
A time bomb

MAX
-and between you and that time
bomb are three highly trained
assassins of distraction despair
and doubt

PETE
Mr Simon I don’t think

MAX
(ignoring Pete)
You know you can take the first
assassin out using the Swansburg
neck break maneuver and you can
floor the second with a solid eye-
gouge nose-break combo

Max freezes A LOW BEEP sounds He looks around suspicious

MAX
Do you hear that

PETE
I think it’s your watch

MAX
(looking at his watch)
Oh crap
HENCHMEN 6

He LEAPS from his chair an ice pack in one hand and a large
WET SPOT on his crotch Gathering up the exam review
booklets he heads for the door

MAX
Sorry Pete Gotta go

PETE
Wait Are you saying I should stay
in band
EXT AGENCY ENTRANCE - DAY
A large stone sign reads The Agency Department of Worldwide

Security A smaller temporary sign planted in the grass
reads Annual Entrance Exams Today

INT AGENCY CLASSROOM - DAY

Two dozen APPLICANTS including Max sit at small school
desks pouring over a multiple-choice test

After a beat one of the APPLICANTS stands and walks his
answer sheet to the PROCTOR at the head of the class Annoyed
and jealous Max watches him exit

INT AGENCY SHOOTING RANGE - DAY

Max and a dozen other APPLICANTS are lined up at a firing
range The others empty their weapons in a ten second span
and push a button to bring in their target posters As the
rattle of the shots clears Max FIRES his first shot

INT AGENCY TESTING ROOM - LATER

Max sits at a small table across from two TESTING AGENTS
strapped into a lie detector

TESTING AGENT 1
All you have to do is lie without
setting off the detector

MAX
Okay Um A lie I can do this

The detector makes a loud BUZZ Testing agent 2 marks his
sheet Max starts to sweat

MAX
Wait okay Wait wait I can lie
HENCHMEN 7

BUZZ
MAX
Okay Here’s one Here’s one I
still live with my grandmother
No buzz
MAX
And I’ve never made love to a real
woman
No buzz
MAX
And I don’t flush public toilets
I’m afraid people will hear me
No buzz
TESTING AGENT 1
Are these really lies
MAX
Of course they are
BUZZ

INT AGENCY FIRING RANGE - DAY

Max takes aim and FIRES his second shot Other applicants
stare a few are sitting

MAX

(to himself)
Slow and steady wins the race

INT AGENCY CLASSROOM - DAY
The room is half empty now but Max continues to sweat it out
over his test Two more APPLICANTS turn in their tests

INT AGENCY FIRING RANGE - DAY

Max FIRES his final shot Max smiles arrogantly and presses a
button to bring in his target

MAX
Haste makes waste my friends
HENCHMEN 8

There is a SINGLE HOLE in the upper right hand corner of the
target Trying to hold his smile he sends his target back
out hoping no one notices

INT AGENCY CLASSROOM - DAY

Max is the only one left in the room With a satisfied smile
he looks over his answer sheet then rises from the desk He
steps over to the proctor waving the sheet with a big grin

PROCTOR
Fifth time’s the charm eh

MAX
So do you grade on a curve or is
it more of a passfail

INT AGENCY - DAY

We are TIGHT on Max’s answer sheet as it is carried by the
proctor through several different rooms and into a mechanized
grading machine It pops out the other side where another
PROCTOR takes the sheet and clips it to the notes from the
testing agents The papers are put into a folder and we see
printed in bold letters Easily Influenced Lacks Leadership
Cracks Under Pressure

A red stamp slams down onto the folder’s cover REJECTED

The proctor STACKS Max’s folder with the other rejects and
seals them all into a cardboard file box It is wheeled on a
hand truck through several more rooms and out through a pair
of swinging doors

EXT AGENCY LOADING DOCK - DAY

The file box sits on the empty loading dock A white van
rolls up and a GUARD climbs out Checking that the coast is
clear he grabs the box and TOSSES it into the van

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT

The white van sits idle in the darkened alley A sleek black
van eases into view and parks next to the white one The
guard climbs out of the white van with the file box while two
HENCHMEN in gray jumpsuits emerge from the black one The
guard hands it off and gives them a nod They all quickly
return to their vehicles and drive off into the night
HENCHMEN 9
EXT APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

INT APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY

Guy KNOCKS at apartment E2 The door opens to the length of
the security chain SUSAN a striking blonde peers out

GUY

SUSAN

The blonde shuts the door rattles the chain and opens the
door wide to reveal her rather large PREGNANT belly

GUY
Wow you’ve really let yourself go
SUSAN

GUY
Pregnant You mean I’m gonna be a
father
SUSAN

HENCHMEN 10

SUSAN

SUSAN
You had a pair of jeans some
socks and a David Lee Roth poster

GUY
I could use the socks about now

SUSAN

She closes the door Guy stares in disbelief

GUY
Man I did not see that coming

INT DINER —- DAY

Guy sips coffee sitting opposite FRANK an overweight union
representative wearing a gravy stained T-shirt that reads
HM LOCAL 419

GUY
Honestly Frank you need to get
these masterminds to master-their-
minds around some sort of
contingency plan when things go
south Do you know how hard it is
to cross South Asia with no
passport Uzbekistan Pakistan I
went through more Stans than a
hooker at an insurance convention

Frank his mouth stuffed with food shrugs

FRANK
Hey the union doesn’t run the Ops
we just provide the benefits Whose
got a better dental

GUY
Yeah well you can keep your
dental plan I’m done No more
plots to take over the world I’ve
got eight years of pension money
coming my way and I’m cashing in

Frank takes a gulp of soda
HENCHMEN 11

FRANK
No can do buddy
(off Guy’s look)
You didn’t read the union by-laws
did you

GUY
Oh come on Frank I have union
rep so I don’t have to read

FRANK
Union rules state that you have to
complete ten Ops before you draw
We can’t have men jobbing in and
out whenever they feel like it

GUY
How many jobs have I done It’s
gotta be more than ten

Frank wipes ketchup off a file and slides it over to Guy

FRANK
Nine

Guy looks through his file

GUY
Nine

FRANK
Yeah you know I don’t think
anyone has actually made it that
far before You’re like a freak of
nature Guys down at the office
thought you should get a plaque

Frank hands Guy an oversized pen

FRANK
We got you this instead

Guy takes the pen from Frank

GUY
A pen

FRANK
It’s a pocket tazer

GUY
I don’t want a pocket tazer or a
damn plaque I want my pension
HENCHMEN 12

FRANK
Look one more job won’t kill you
Or at least hopefully it won’t
And then youll be sitting pretty

Frank digs into the stack of files on the seat next to him
and comes up with one

FRANK
I even got you an easy set up It’s
a new Op Guy named Rochefort He’s
hiring every yahoo in a jumpsuit
You hang back stay out of the
shit you’ll be over and out in no
time Nice and easy

Guy leans back taking it all in

GUY
Nice and easy huh

INT NANA’S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Max holding his REJECTION LETTER slouches at one end of a
plastic covered couch in his grandmother’s den His
grandmother NANA sits in an easy chair knitting They are
both staring straight ahead at the television - Matlock

NANA
There’s always next year

MAX
(disgusted)
Next year

NANA
The most important thing is that
you do your very best Remember be
yourself everyone else is taken

While Max petulantly mouths “everyone else is taken” the
doorbell RINGS He HEAVES himself from the couch

INTEXT NANA’S FRONT DOOR - EVENING

Max opens the door to find a SMALL PACKAGE on the doorstep
He looks up and down the quiet New Jersey suburban street and
sees no one He picks up the package listens to it sniffs
it shakes it There is only one word printed on it MAX
HENCHMEN 13

INT MAX’S ROOM - LATER

Max’s room decked out with POSTERS and BAND TROPHIES looks

the same as when he was fourteen The contents of the package
are spread across his bed a HARD HAT a SAFETY VEST with an

MTA logo on it a MAP with some directions and a DVD

Max turns the DVD over in his hands then crosses the room to
a TV and DVD player

As Max settles back onto the bed the screen blinks and a
video fades in Henchmen Saving the world from itself
Max raises an eyebrow The title dissolves into a smiling
NARRATOR in a white jumpsuit

NARRATOR
Hi Max Sorry about your agency
test we know you’re disappointed

Max looks around a little freaked out

NARRATOR
But where they see failure we at
the Henchmen World Union see your
future

The Narrator is replaced with scenes of various HENCHMEN
guarding various modern facilities smiling at each other and
occasionally waving

NARRATOR
Max are you ready for adventure
Ready to travel to exotic
locations Ready to change the
world Then maybe you’re ready to
be a henchmen

We see henchmen still smiling and with MACHINE GUNS strapped
to their backs DIGGING a well in central Africa PLAYING
soccer with children in the barrios of Mexico HELPING a
heifer birth a calf on a small Missouri farm

NARRATOR (0S)
In the past henchmen and the
masterminds that employ them have
gotten a bad reputation but the
truth is no one is doing more to
improve conditions around the
globe Everywhere henchmen are
helpmen

Max raises the other eyebrow - he’s intrigued
HENCHMEN 14

The video cuts to a small poverty stricken village A
HENCHMAN stands in the middle of an unpaved litter strewn
street The villagers slightly annoyed go about their
business Title New Dungbow Bangladesh

HENCHMAN 1

Just 3 years ago Dungbow was what
some would have called a shit hole
But with big machinery and a little
ingenuity we were able to cover
that hole up and tap its natural
gas reserves while relocating the
entire village here

We pan with Henchman 1 as he takes a few steps to his right
revealing a spotless 7-11 STORE between two shacks

HENCHMAN 1
Once moved we contracted
convenience stores like this 7-11
Now we get Slurpies 24 hours a day
and we’re giving villagers the on-
the-job-training they’1l need when
they sneak into America

Another HENCHMAN is outside a shanty between two grubby eight-
year-old CHILDREN He has a hand on each of their heads
Title Dangret Mountains Cambodia

HENCHMAN 2
Meet Tiffany and Zach Those are
nicknames I gave them Their real
names are really hard to say When
we purchased a textile factory as
cover for a cloning laboratory we
learned that these two along with
countless other children worked
long hours in deplorable conditions
assembling low quality garments for
American consumers

Another HENCHMAN steps into view with two balloons and hands
one to each of the kids Close-up on their smiling faces

HENCHMAN 2
Improving the quality of those
clothes is something we’re
committed to

We see Max on the bed entranced

MAX
Aw balloons
HENCHMEN 15

The video cuts to the interior of a large modern facility in
total chaos - EXPLOSIONS MACHINE GUN FIRE SIRENS

NARRATOR
Of course there’s danger

A sinister unattractive man in a suave secret agent-esq
suit is shooting it out A HENCHMAN with NUMCHUCKS SWINGING
flies through the air and disables the Agent

NARRATOR
But there’s also romance

Two HENCHMEN SHIRTLESS but with machine guns still on their
backs sit in a HOT TUB as six SCANTLY CLAD WOMEN with
daiquiris climb in

NARRATOR
And friendship

The two henchmen in the hot tub high-five Freeze-frame

NARRATOR
Henchmen Are you ready for the
challenge

The scene dissolves back to the narrator as Max heaves
himself from the bed shaking his head

MAX
Please they’re the bad guys

NARRATOR
I know what you’re thinking
“They’re the bad guys”

Max stops surprised and puzzled

NARRATOR
But labels just hurt If we’re the
bad guys who are the good guys
The Agency Governments
(laughing)
You’re not that naive

Max quickly laughs along shrugging in agreement

NARRATOR
World Wars Taxes The fake moon
landing
(beat)
The fact is without us there’d be
no quote-unquote “good guys” We’re
the ying to their yang
HENCHMEN

Max is sucked in forgetting he’s talking to a television

MAX
But you just wreak havoc for piles
of money

NARRATOR

(interrupting)
Sure it seems like we’re just
wreaking havoc for piles of money
but in fact we only threaten to
wreak havoc Money is beside the
point It’s a means to an end And
as Mahatma Gandhi said “The ends
always justify the means”

MAX
He said that

Max sits on the edge of his bed

NARRATOR

The world needs a change Max As a
henchman you’1ll be working for
proactive men Men who are actually
trying to do something

(beat)
Besides as a member of the
Henchmen World Union youll
receive a carry-over pension and be
part of one kick-ass dental plan

Max is nodding but then catches himself

MAX
Come on Max snap out of it

NARRATOR

Think about it Max How many times
has the Agency rejected you They
think you’re too easily influenced
but we know that just means you’re
open to new ideas

(manipulative)
Aren’t you Max

Max nods almost imperceptibly
NARRATOR

Were here to say yes Yes to Max
Simon Yesto your future
HENCHMEN 17

Max can’t bring himself to switch off the television He
picks up the hard hat then looks back at the screen - his
moment of truth

NARRATOR
This DVD will self destruct

The DVD player starts to HISS and SMOKE Max scrambles

MAX
No no no

He frantically presses the eject button but it is too late -
the DVD player SPARKS then EXPLODES into a thousand pieces A
chunk SMACKS Max in the forehead and KNOCKS him to the floor

INT SUBWAY PLATFORM — NIGHT

Max appears in a hard hat and reflective vest emblazoned with
the New York MTA logo He checks his watch and eyes the
handful of PEOPLE that idle on the platform

Title New York USA

At one end of the tracks a diesel service train chugs into
view pulling a flatbed car of MTA SERVICE PERSONNEL The
train clatters to a halt and Max steps on with the other
workers He takes a seat and the train lurches into motion

INT SUBWAY TUNNELS — NIGHT

The train winds its way under the city carrying the dozen or
so WORKERS Max is wedged between two stone-faced MEN

MAX
So first time

The two men sit silently eyes straight ahead No response
After a beat Max shrugs catches the eye of the MAN across
from him and gives him a little wave

INT HENCHMAN CONVENTION — NIGHT

The train rolls into a secret surprisingly large CONVENTION
CENTER deep under the city — complete with garish lighting
industrial carpeting and aluminum convention booths A wide
banner proclaims HENCHMEN Saving the World from itself

Max and the rest of the men disembark leaving their MTA
disguises on the train Max pauses taking it all in
HENCHMEN 18

Before him are dozens of display booths with banners like
“Henchman Insurance Your job cost you an arm and a leg your
insurance shouldn’t” and “The Pocket Grappling Hook
Everyone’s a Hero” The aisles teem with a motley collection
of henchman job seekers along with an occasional clique of
ASIANS in white jumpsuits and bright blue hard hats

As Max strolls down the aisles he passes a small group
surrounding a gabby SALESMAN

SALESMAN
Every henchman needs an exit
strategy Sure the boss usually
gets the short end of the stick
but what about the handful of you
that make it out alive Are you
really living and working to your
full potential as a handmaiden to
world domination

The salesman deftly grabs a copy of the book and holds it up
for his audience

SALESMAN
Isn’t it time you ask yourselves
“What color is my jumpsuit”

A few paces further Max passes a large CROWD of black and
Latino henchmen ARNOLD a charismatic black spokesman
stands on a small platform regaling his audience The banner
reads “The Black and Latino Henchmen Association”

ARNOLD
Charlie you were on that Jamaican
job last year how many brothers
were on that job

CHARLIE
Just me and you

ARNOLD
Two in Jamaica Do you know how
conspicuous that was

INT INTERVIEW AREA — LATER

The interview area is cordoned off by tall curtains marked by
large cardboard numbers To one side bulletin boards display
job listings We see a small group of drop-dead gorgeous
WOMEN scanning the postings under the heading Femme Fatales
Another group of thickset steroid-enhanced MEN are looking
at listings under AssassinsOperations Managers
HENCHMEN 19

Max is with the largest group of MEN trying to see all of the
jobs listed for General Henchmen

INT INTERVIEW BOOTH — LATER

Max sits in a cramped interview booth surrounded by thick
curtains Across a flimsy table sits an intimidating
INTERVIEWER with a huge scar down the center of his face He
looks over Max’s resume

INTERVIEWER
If you had to describe yourself in
one word what would it be

MAX
Punctual

We see a quick series of INTERVIEWERS each more hideous than
the last Max offers a different one word answer each time

MAX
Hygenic Vivacious Swarthy
Flappable I mean unflappable
Enigmatic Whimsical Fiducial

On this last one Max sits across the table from THE KAISER
He is an ENORMOUS man in full military uniform - a disgraced
Eastern European nobleman turned assassinoperations manager
His most notable feature is a FALSE RIGHT EYE made of
stainless steel He squints suspiciously at Max

THE KAISER
Fiducial

MAX
Yeah it means reliable and

THE KAISER
(interrupting)
I know what it means I am The
Kaiser operations manager for
Rochefort If you work for
Rochefort you work for me
(beat)
I see you’ve never actually done
any henchmaning

MAX
Well no

THE KAISER
But it says here you’ve had some
combat experience
HENCHMEN 20

MAX
Yes sir Sort of I went to Chuck
Liddell’s Warrior Weekend
Intensive Ultimate Fighter stuff
But I’m a very fast learner I
perfected some of the techniques

Max pushes back from the table and sets himself against an
invisible foe The Kaiser raises an eyebrow

THE KAISER
That really won’t be necessary

Max straightens up a bit defeated The Kaiser stamps Max’s
resume and places it in a large pile

THE KAISER
Frankly we need all the men we can
get

MAX

You mean I’m hired
The Kaiser slides a contract across the table

THE KAISER
Just sign here

Max looks down at the contract then up at the Kaiser who is
busy with other paperwork

MAX
So I sign this and I’m a henchman

THE KAISER
(without looking up)
Sign that and you work for
Rochefort quite possibly the most
brilliant man who has ever lived

The Kaiser finally looks up at Max deadpan
THE KAISER
Sign that Max and you will be
part of history
Max bites his lip his pen hovering over the contract
MAX

And youre serious about henchmen
saving the world from
HENCHMEN 21

THE KAISER
(reaching for contract)
Oh just forget it

MAX
Okay okay sorry

Max dashes off his signature The Kaiser quickly files away
the contract but Max remembers one last thing

MAX
By the way who do I talk to about
getting reimbursed for my DVD
player I don’t mind but my
grandmother loves her Netflix

THE KAISER
Next

MAX
Right we’ll talk later Thank you

EXT JUNGLE LANDING STRIP — DAY

A passenger jet with the Rochefort logo touches down on the
muddied landing strip in the middle of a dense jungle

Title Altamira Northern Brazil

The jet rolls to a stop near three waiting buses We see The
Kaiser at attention in front of the lead bus A ground CREW
in khaki jumpsuits moves mobile stairs into place as the
cabin door swings open

Several HENCHMEN emerge from the plane before we see Max
squinting into the Brazilian sun Arnold spokesman for the
Black and Latino Henchmen Association brushes past him

MAX
Man I’m going to freckle for sure

Arnold slips on a pair of sunglasses

ARNOLD
Welcome to the jungle

Max joins the flow of henchmen filing onto the buses as
PIERREa French Canadian in a wheelchair with a buzz cut and
a soul patch emerges from the plane

PIERRE
No ramp Merde
HENCHMEN 22

INT BUS - DAY

Max climbs aboard a converted school bus full of stern-faced
HENCHMEN As Max walks down the aisle each henchman moves
his bag onto the seat or simply stares him down

Finally at the back of the bus Max spots Guy wide-mouthed
and fast asleep next to an empty seat He sits down

GUY
(still asleep)
Too many Triscuits Can’t swallow

EXT JUNGLE ROAD — DAY

The buses lumber along the recently cleared jungle road

INT BUS — DAY

Guy is still asleep Beside him Max is reading from a thick
binder They are jostling with every bump in the road One
particularly big bump wakes Guy He rubs his eyes and lowers
his window trying to get his bearings

GUY
Where are we

MAX
We refueled in Mexico I spotted
the ruins of Teotihuacan from the
air And given our flight time Id
say we couldn’t have gotten much
further than northern South
America

Max thinks a moment then leans forward to Arnold
MAX
Hey I don’t suppose you know our
precise location
ARNOLD
Hey Rand McNally you think they’re
gonna tell me something you don’t
know

Max settles back and looks to Guy

MAX
Colombia or Brazil maybe

After beat
HENCHMEN

GUY
You’re new aren’t you

MAX
I’m Max

GUY
(looking out the window)
Name’s Guy

MAX
So what do you know about this
Rochefort

GUY
He signs my checks That’s all I
need to know

MAX
But I mean it must be a big
operation Look at all these guys

Guy takes in the bus around them

GUY
More men less work
(off Max’s binder)
What’s that

MAX
Training manual

GUY
Training manual

MAX
Yeah Did you know you have to
finish ten jobs before

Guy YANKS the binder out of Max’s hands

GUY
Let me see that

Guy thumbs through the binder feigning interest Then
summarily TOSSES it out the window

MAX
Hey They charged me for that
HENCHMEN 24

GUY
Look Max Here’s the gig keep
your head down stay out of the
shit and enjoy the fringe
benefits Training complete

Guy settles back into his seat and shuts his eyes Max is
still in shock He leans forward to Arnold

MAX
(whispering)
Can I borrow your manual

EXT ROCHEFORT MINING COMPLEX — DAY

Rochefort’s facility consists of several large concrete
bunkers in a clearing at the base of a jagged cliff
surrounded by razor wire We can see several tunnels dug into
the cliff and dozens of indigenous LABORERS moving in and out
of them carrying sacks of debris The busses roll through the
main gates and circle up in the middle of the compound

INT BUS - DAY

Guy still beside Max is looking uncomfortable and restless
The Kaiser steps onto the bus and addresses the new recruits

THE KAISER
Gentlemen welcome to your new
home Before you leave the bus we
have a first order of business

GUY
(quietly to Max)
Is he kidding I had like eighty
Frescas on that flight

THE KAISER
There has been a union complaint
about a lack of contingency plans

GUY
Um excuse me Kaiser Could we
perhaps use the facilities first

THE KAISER
That’s THE Kaiser I insist on that
definite article
HENCHMEN 25

GUY
The Kaiser I would have thought
that was more of a third person
kind of thing You know like
“Don’t mess with The Kaiser” One
on one it seems pretty awkward

There are a few suppressed chuckles from the men The Kaiser
glares at Guy and continues his announcement at a low boil

THE KAISER
We are instigating a buddy system

The bus ERUPTS in disappointed groans Guy looks around a
bit embarrassed and settles back into his seat

THE KAISER
Before leaving this bus you must
choose a buddy You will be
responsible for him and he will be
responsible for you

Max looks to the HENCHMAN across the aisle - he is a hulking
mass of hair and body odor He turns back to Guy

GUY

Cool Me and you Matt
MAX

Max
GUY

Whatever you say buddy Gotta go
hydrate the jungle

Max tries to argue but it’s too late Guy has jumped from
his seat and is running for the door

INT BARRACKS — DAY

HENCHMEN file into the barracks a large open space with rows
of beds A khaki jumpsuit and sub-machine gun are laid out on
each bed along with a mint on each pillow We see a fruit
basket with a “Welcome” card attached Max finds a bed and
takes up his weapon

MAX
German parts French assembly Top
of the line Nice

Max begins unpacking a stack of SELF-HELP BOOKS then looks
up to see Guy admiring the khaki jumpsuit
HENCHMEN 26

GUY
I really like this color I saw it
on some of the guys and hoped it
was standard issue

Max looks down at his new gun then back up at Guy

MAX
Maybe we rushed into this whole
buddy thing We should take our
time get to know other people

GUY
What are you breaking up with me

Guy unzips the suit and feels the inside

GUY
Silk lining wicks away moisture
(slipping into the suit)
Warm in winter and cool in summer
And look Pockets

Across the room Pierre squints at his pillow

PIERRE
Is that a mint

INT COMPOUND CLINIC - DAY

Max and Guy clad in their new jumpsuits are standing ina
long line of HENCHMEN A large sign reads Vaccinations Max
walks backwards reasoning with Guy as Arnold and Pierre
trail behind

MAX
It’s just if we’re going to work
as a team we should be compatible

GUY
Team Down boy Don’t be so eager
It’s just a job

MAX
Just a job But we’re here to make
a difference - to be part of
something bigger

Pierre rolls out of line to face Max

PIERRE
Cest lesprit
HENCHMEN 27

Guy just shakes his head

PIERRE

I remember my first Op Oh what
thrills what action le fait
détre concupiscent Guy told me I
wouldn’t walk out of there alive
Ha Well I showed him how a

(trails off)
Well I’m still alive

Arnold leans over Guy’s shoulder addressing Max

ARNOLD
Were security guards with stamps
in our passports Don’t get
delusions of grandeur

GUY
He’s right newbie

Max is surprised to see he’s now at the front of the line and
a NURSE-HENCHMAN is waiting with prepared syringe He
swallows hard unzips his suit and bends over

MAX
(to Guy)
Hey just because I’m new doesn’t
mean I’m stupid

NURSE-HENCHMEN
Uh this goes in your arm

Embarrassed Max straightens up and rolls up his sleeve

GUY
Yeah you got it all figured out

INT COMPOUND AUDITORIUM - LATER

The newly arrived HENCHMEN including Guy and Max sit ina
large darkened auditorium in rows of chairs They are all
watching a very low budget video

VIDEO NARRATOR (0S)
Sexual harrassment is no laughing
matter

On the screen we see two male HENCHMEN machine guns strapped
to their backs working a copier
HENCHMEN 28

VIDEO HENCHMAN 1
Would you mind bending over for
some more paper

VIDEO HENCHMAN 2
Sure thing

Henchman 2 bends over as Henchman 1 leers dramatically

VIDEO NARRATOR
We want everyone to feel they are
in a safe working environment

Our attention drifts back to Guy and Max

GUY

Look Max I understand your
enthusiasm But you can’t let these
guys get in your head or you won’t
last your first Op They want you
to think you’re special but we’re
just nameless human targets in
matching suits

(beat)
See that guy up there

In the front row sits a HENCHMAN with perfect posture taking
notes Max nods impressed

GUY
I give him a week

MAX
Him

GUY
Oh yeah the eager bird bites the
worm every time

Max is a bit puzzled by Guy’s “proverb”

EXT ROCHEFORT MINING COMPLEX - DAY

Guy Max and the rest of the henchmen ride through the
complex in a long open-air TROLLEY The Kaiser stands at the
front pointing out sites over a microphone

THE KAISER
On your right is the ammunition
bunker and state of the art
laboratory

(MORE)
HENCHMEN

THE KAISER (CONTD)
Up ahead you’1l see the newly
refurbished torture compound
complete with a water-boarding
feature and snake pit In the
distance you can just make out the
tennis courts and pilates gym Like
the compound and sauna earlier
they are strictly off limits

GUY
(quietly to Max)
And you see those guys over there

Guy motions to three muscle-bound HENCHMEN admiring each
other’s biceps

GUY
Roid-Heads They’11 die too And
the dweebs three seats up

Two young HENCHMEN are playing rock paper scissors

GUY
ADD no focus They’1l survive
for a while but I hope they don’t
have pets waiting at home

MAX
So who lives

Guy looks around the trolley then shrugs

GUY
Me

EXT ROCHEFORT MINING COMPLEX - LATER

The Kaiser wearing a GAS MASK stands before the new

recruits

Behind the Kaiser are the tunnels dug into the

cliff we saw earlier Dozens of indigenous LABORERS continue
working as a thin red haze emanates from the tunnels

THE KAISER
Behind me is reason you are here -
one of the most advanced mining
operations in the world

ARNOLD
Why are you wearing a gas mask

THE KAISER
What we are mining is a highly
dangerous substance

(MORE)
HENCHMEN 30

THE KAISER (CONTD)
Just inhaling the fumes once could
cost a man ten years of his life

GUY
Ah excuse me Mr The Kaiser
Shouldn’t we have gas masks

The Kasier waits a beat

THE KAISER
Please save all questions until the
end of the tour This way

The Kaiser walks off and the henchmen follow

EXT ROCHEFORT MINING COMPLEX — LATER

The henchmen including Guy and Max are in formation The
Kaiser stands at attention facing them

THE KAISER
And now may I present your
employer Rochefort

Music swells as the earth SPLITS OPEN in front of the
henchmen and ROCHEFORT emerges on a VERY SLOW-RISING
platform He is a doughy 40-something in a white short-
sleeved button-down shirt shorts and black socks - Bill
Gates as Evil Mastermind

Standing behind him is ZOE a classic femme fatale in a nylon
jumpsuit and oversized Gucci belt She is young beautiful
and coolly detached

The platform moves AGONIZINGLY SLOW and Guy shifts his feet

GUY
I hate this grandstanding

MAX
He probably just wants to make an
impression

GUY
He built a small city in the middle
of the jungle I get it already
You want to really impress me how
about a barbeque on our first day
Maybe some door prizes You know
show us a good time before all the
heavy lifting

(beat)
(MORE )
HENCHMEN 31

GUY (CONTD)
Besides I saw Van Halen do this
same thing in like ‘85

Rochefort is almost in full view when the platform CLUNKS to
a halt two feet below ground level Rochefort looks at The
Kaiser disappointed The Kaiser shrugs

THE KAISER
Must be the humidity

The Kaiser puts out a hand to help Rochefort CLIMB OUT of the
hole just as the platform JERKS back to life nearly knocking
Rochefort off his feet

ROCHEFORT
Oh it’s working now

The platform reaches ground level and continues to rise

ROCHEFORT
Wait wait Turn it off

It rises two feet and stops Rochefort begins to CLIMB OFF
and it JERKS up a little more Rochefort JUMPS off and tries
to restrain his frustration

Zoe rolls her eyes and gracefully steps from the platform

Rochefort scans the crowd a moment trying hard to look
authoritative

ROCHEFORT
You men I may not know your
names to be perfectly honest
you all look pretty much the same
to me

ARNOLD
(quietly to Pierre)
You think he’s talking about us

ROCHEFORT
But I know who you are You are the
privileged few who will help
unleash the power of the universe
itself and bring the world to its
knees All I demand is your
loyalty and for some of you
perhaps your life But for all of
you I promise a mark in history
Yes I even promise you the world

Rochefort walks down the line inspecting the men
HENCHMEN 32

ROCHEFORT
You don’t believe me I don’t blame
you

He stops in front of Pierre puzzles over the wheelchair but
continues on

ROCHEFORT
How many of you have heard this
speech in your line of work

Rochefort stops face to face with the HENCHMAN next to Guy

ROCHEFORT
How many times have you been
promised ultimate victory

The henchman remains silent Rochefort looks to Guy

ROCHEFORT
And how many times as it slipped
away

GUY
Honestly

ROCHEFORT
Yes Honestly

GUY
Everyone promises the world but no
one delivers Ever

ROCHEFORT
And do those broken promises rot
your soul

GUY

Not really I’ve never really felt
world domination was the point
It’s sort of a “the journey is the
destination” kind of vibe What got
me into was the steady paycheck and
the three squares a day And I
gotta say it’s been an okay ride

Rochefort’s eyes narrow and he turns from Guy in disgust

ROCHEFORT
I promise you more More than just
a steady paycheck and“three
squares”
HENCHMEN 33

There is an awkward beat as The Kaiser steps over and
whispers in Rochefort’s ear

ROCHEFORT
(quietly to The Kaiser)
That’s what “three squares” means
Huh
(to the men)
So anyway I promise you more The
world will be ours

The speech ended The Kaiser steps forward

THE KAISER
That is all You will now report to
your barracks

The men begin to disperse In the background Rochefort and
Zoe climb back on the platform It SLOWLY descends

MAX
That was pretty good

GUY
I give him points for the one on
one time That was a nice touch

They all head for the barracks We see Pierre his wheelchair
stuck in the mud

PIERRE
A little help

INT CAFETERIA — DAY

Guy and Max are seated at a long table staring down at trays
full of non-descript barely identifiable food

MAX
Maybe you’ve just had bad luck with
masterminds Maybe this guy is for
real

Guy takes a sip of his bright red beverage
GUY
The fruit punch is good Have you
tried the fruit punch It says it’s
100 juice

Max shakes his head disappointed
HENCHMEN

MAX
It can’t hurt to have a little
faith Don’t you get tired of
losing all the time

GUY
Losing The way I see it I’m
wearing quality threads got a
shiny new gun and am well into my
first in a long line of free meals
Granted the food could be better
but you can’t cook for this many
people and expect to maintain the
quality It’s basic chemistry

MAX
I’m not talking about you I’m
talking about us The team

GUY
(dismayed)
Again with the team

A HENCHMAN carrying stacks of envelopes passes by their
table laying one down in front of every pair of buddies

Guy takes

Guy opens

EXT OPEN

HENCHMAN
Job assignments

up his envelope
GUY

Something easy something easy
the envelope and as he reads it his face drops

Max and Guy stand at the edge of a lagoon of raw sewage

EXT OPEN

CESSPOOL - LATER

Guy relaxes on a chaise lounge sipping a drink while Max
floats over the SEWAGE in a small boat DREDGING the surface
with a pool skimmer
HENCHMEN

GUY
Guidance counselor Seriously

MAX
Yeah But I saw it more as a place-
holder until something more
exciting came along
(beat)
What about you

GUY

Oh you know the usual Small
town wanted out wanted to see the
world The Agency was a no-go I
mean there’s agent or being some
desk monkey and I didn’t have the
chops to make agent So it was
this the Navy or being a male
flight attendant I’m not gay so
henchman-ing was my only option
And honestly I thought women would
really go for it you know Fact
is chicks don’t want to hear about
what you do for a living Job talk
just isn’t sexy anymore

(beat)
They usually don’t believe you
anyway Dating is just hard

Guy looks over at Max struggling with the pool skimmer

GUY
You missed a spot

EXT ROCHEFORT’S MINING COMPLEX - LATE AFTERNOON

Max and Guy trudge across the grounds filthy from raw

sewage

GUY
I can’t take another day of that

MAX
Maybe we just need to distinguish
ourselves somehow Get noticed

GUY
Max We are by definition
indistinguishable Kinda the point
really

HENCHMEN 36

As they walk by a small courtyard next to Rochefort’s
compound we hear a woman’s SCREAM coming from a second story
window Max stops

MAX
What was that

Another SCREAM Guy keeps walking

GUY
Id say that was a woman screaming

MAX
Guy She could be in trouble

GUY
(turning to Max)
There is only one woman within 1000
miles of here - and she is off
limits Didn’t you read the manual

MAX
You threw it away

Another SCREAM Max turns to the compound

MAX
We’ve got to do something

Max JUMPS a garden bench RACES for a trellis and begins to
climb Guy shakes his head hands on hips

GUY
Max Don’t be a hero It’s not in
your job description

EXT ROCHEFORT’S COMPOUND - DAY

Max scales the trellis and LEAPS onto a balcony He can hear
a woman struggling in one of the nearby rooms Desperate he
tries one door - locked

Leaning over the balcony he can see open shutters and exposed
beams above Quickly he unzips his jumpsuit and pulls out a
POCKET GRAPPLING HOOK He throws a hook toward the exposed
beams and miraculously it holds

MAX
(to himself)
You can do this

He LAUNCHES HIMSELF off the balcony swinging out over open
space and into the open shutters
HENCHMEN 37

INT ZOE’S BATHROOM —- DAY

Max CRASHES through the shutters and SPRAWLS onto the floor
of the bathroom Zoe reclining in a steaming bath stares at
Max as he recovers setting himself for combat

MAX
Are you okay

ZOE
What the hell are you doing

Max glances around then straightens up confused

MAX
You’re alone

ZOE
Well I was

MAX
I heard screams I thought

Max takes in the room notices a few candles burning soft
music playing a tube of something near the tub He puts two
and two together and he blushes

MAX
Ohhh Um sorry It’s just

Zoe stands in the tub completely naked Max’s eyes nearly
explode Then he lamely tries not to look

MAX
Oh This is awkward

ZOE
Hand me that

Zoe motions to a small table There is a robe a bottle of
chilled champagne and a filled glass Max grabs the robe

ZOE
Not the robe

MAX
Oh

Still holding the robe Max picks up the glass and hands it
to Zoe A SURPRISED SMILE spreads across her face

ZOE
You were coming to rescue me
Thats sweet
HENCHMEN 38

Out of instinct Max covers himself with the robe and backs
toward the open window He looks down reconsiders and moves
toward a door

MAX
Yes But no need I see
Everyone’s entitled to a little
“me” time
(babbling mortified)
Nothing to be ashamed of

He slips out the door and Zoe smiles in spite of herself Max
pokes his head back in and hangs the robe on a hook

MAX
Sorry this is yours

Max catches a glimpse of Zoe’s body

MAX
(to himself)
Oh sweet Lord
(ducking back out)
Enjoy your evening

INT BARRACKS LOUNGE — LATER

Guy and Arnold are battling it out over a foosball table Max
sits on a stool behind them reading a self-help book titled
The Best Me Possible HENCHMEN in various states of
relaxation watch a flat panel television or play pool In one
corner a jukebox plays an old blues tune as two HENCHMEN
slow dance together

Arnold flicks his wrist and sends the foosball to Guy’s goal

ARNOLD
(to Max)
So the boss’s girlfriend was sowing
a little of her own oats huh
Maybe Rochefort isn’t the stand up
guy you think he is

MAX
Is that a pun of some sort

GUY
Were just saying if he can’t keep
one oversexed femme fatale happy
where else is he falling short

Max finally looks up
HENCHMEN 39

MAX
I don’t think that has anything to
do with his ability to take over
the world

Arnold CRUSHES another shot scoring again

ARNOLD
Tell that to Eva Braun

Guy steps over to a vending machine that announces BEER in
generic letters A flyer taped to the vending machine
reads Auditions for the Henchmen Players Les Misérables this
Tuesday

GUY
There’s something you need to
understand about this gig Anyone
actually trying to take over the
world is already an idiot

As Guy slips a couple of bills into the machine a HENCHMAN
passes BELTING out a version of “Who Am I” From Les
Misérables Unfazed Guy retrieves two cans of beer He
tosses one to Arnold and cracks open his own

GUY
And anyone willing to spend this
much cash on a plan that will
inevitably fail is certifiable
Some Agent will show up before this
Rochefort poisons the earth’s water
supply or floods the southern
hemisphere or whatever And then
youre on to the next job

PIERRE (0S)
Don’t listen to him Max

Guy turns to see Pierre roll into view

PIERRE
Guy already has one foot out the
door

GUY

Don’t start Pierre

PIERRE
(to Max)
I remember a time when being a
henchman meant something to our
friend here
HENCHMEN 40

GUY

(to Pierre)
Deep down you know I’m right

(to Max)
Even if this guy did miraculously
achieve world domination you think
we get half of Moldova for a job
well done There is no “team”
That’s just not the way these
things work We’re just employees
That’s why he’s over in the big
house and we’re skimming the shit
pool

Guy puts an arm around Max and leads him away from Pierre

GUY
You know what we need buddy We
need a closer look at how the other
half lives

Guy and Max exit Pierre and Arnold watch them leave There
is an awkward beat

ARNOLD
How the hell did you get this job
anyway

PIERRE

Viva la affirmative action

ARNOLD
Touche

Arnold holds out a fist Pierre not sure what to do leans
over and kisses it

EXT ROCHEFORT MINING COMPLEX — NIGHT

Guy leads Max across the clearing toward Rochefort’s
compound He takes a last swig of his beer and tosses it

MAX
This is crazy We don’t pick and
choose our assignments There’s a
protocol to these things

GUY
This place is crawling with khaki
jumpsuits You think management
knows the difference
HENCHMEN 41

EXT ROCHEFORT’S COMPOUND — NIGHT

Two HENCHMEN stand guard at the front door of the compound as
Guy and Max approach Guy is all confidence Max is trying
unsuccessfully to look nonchalant

GUY
Thanks for holding our place Rick

Guy gives one of the guards a friendly slap on the back The
two guards look at each other then back at Guy

GUARD 1
It’s Steve and we’re on duty until
six

GUY

So get moving boys your shift on
the eastern perimeter started 10
minutes ago

The guards share a look Guy feigning exasperation holds
out a hand toward Max

GUY
Max let me see the shift schedule

Max stands there awkwardly not sure of his role in the ruse

GUY
You didn’t bring the schedule Damn
it Max

GUARD 1
We don’t know anything about shift
changes

GUY
Hey we don’t pick and choose our
assignments There’s a protocol to
these things

Max smiles a little self-satisfied smile

GUY
The Kaiser sent us over here to
relieve you guys take it up with
him if you want But we’re suppose
to take over here and that’s what
were going to do

GUARD 2
All right all right We’ll go sort
it out
HENCHMEN 42

GUY
You do that

The two guards move away and Guy takes up his post by the
front door Max takes his position next to Guy

MAX
What now

Guy keeps his eyes on the retreating guards until they are
well out of sight

GUY
Now We go see what’s in the
fridge
Guy slips stealthily into the front door Max is horrified

MAX
What What are you doing

Max alone tries to look on duty

INT ROCHEFORT’S COMPOUND — NIGHT
Max peeks inside the front door

MAX
Guy

Glancing around he reluctantly steps inside The interior of
the compound is sleek lines and all leather and dark wood
Max steps cautiously through the living room

MAX
Guy

A toilet FLUSHES Max JUMPS training his gun on the
direction of the sound A door opens and Guy steps out wiping
his hands on his jumpsuit

MAX
(an angry whisper)
What are you doing

GUY
Going to the bathroom

MAX
In there
HENCHMEN

GUY
Where would you have gone
(beat)
They have these tiny little soaps
Hard to get a lather

MAX
They’re probably just decoration

GUY
How are you supposed to wash your
hands

MAX
I don’t know Probably no one uses
that bathroom It’s one of those
show bathrooms

GUY
Show bathroom

MAX
You know the extra one just to
show off Like a front room no one
uses

GUY
That’s ridiculous

Guy strolls through the living room feeling the upholstery

Max is creeping behind him desperate to leave

MAX
You know what’s ridiculous Us in
here

GUY
Would you stop whining We’re in
here now let’s take a look around

Guy notices a stairway and begins to ascend

MAX
No I’m leaving Now

GUY
Does the buddy system mean nothing
to you You’re the one who wanted
to be part of a team

Guy disappears upstairs shaking his head in disappointment
Max stands at the bottom frustrated and angry Finally he
STORMS up the stairs muttering to himself
HENCHMEN 44

INT HALLWAY IN ROCHEFORT’S COMPOUND — DAY

Photographs of Rochefort and various important world leaders
cover the walls of the hallway Guy and Max walk quietly past
each one taking a closer look at some of them

GUY
Rochefort won a Nobel Prize

On the opposite wall Max is squinting at another photograph

MAX
Is that Ann Coulter

At the end of the hallway a door FLIES open Guy and Max
JUMP to attention on either wall trying to blend in
Rochefort appears tucking in his shirt He looks both furious
and deeply embarrassed He passes Guy and Max hesitates and
eyes both of them a moment

ROCHEFORT
We need towels in the master
bedroom

He then pushes through a nearby door SLAMMING it behind him

GUY
Do I look like house keeping

Max exhales The first door FLIES open again and the two of
them JUMP to attention Zoe emerges wrapping a bathrobe
around her She STORMS down the hall her eyes a squint of
anger in the direction Rochefort just passed

Zoe stops between Max and Guy still fuming eyes straight
ahead She glances at Max a brief moment of recognition

ZOE
You I need a sparing partner

Zoe grabs Max and PULLS him through a nearby door The door
SLAMS behind them leaving Guy alone in the hallway
INT EXERCISE ROOM — DAY
MAX
-but Chuck Liddell didn’t show up

all weekend So that was a jip

He finds himself standing in a room filled with various
rather intimidating sparing weapons

HENCHMEN 45

MAX
Wow

Zoe begins to untie her robe as she moves toward a screen to
change Max averts his eyes by focusing on a rather nasty
looking weapon hanging on the wall

MAX
My Dojo was nothing like this

INT KITCHEN AT ROCHEFORT’S COMPOUND — DAY

Guy wanders into the well-appointed kitchen He picks at some
fruit on a counter and turns admiring the refrigerator

GUY
Viking built-ins Nice

INT EXERCISE ROOM - DAY

Zoe has Max in a scissor hold his head in a socially awkward
position

ZOE
What are you saying he’s
intimidated

Max can barely breathe much less talk

MAX
Who wouldn’t be

ZOE
What

Max SLAPS the mat and Zoe releases him

MAX
I said who wouldn’t be

Zoe JUMPS to her feet as Max massages his neck and slowly
rises from the mat She pulls two QUARTERSTAFFS from the wall
and tosses one to Max He fumbles it but quickly gets into
position more out of fear than skill

ZOE
Rochefort’s a very successful man
why would he be intimidated by me

Max relaxes pondering her question
HENCHMEN 46

MAX
You know success is a funny
thing

Before he can finish his thought Zoe is on the ATTACK Max
successfully parries the BLOWS mostly by accident Zoe gets
in close locking Max’s staff in hers

ZOE
What’s so funny about it

MAX
We are all seeking something
filling voids Some men seek
success because they feel
inadequate in other areas

ZOE
You mean like a penis replacement

MAX
I’ve never really been a big fan of
Freud

In a fluid movement Zoe spins away from Max and THRUSTS a
heel into his chest sending him SPRAWLING onto the mat

INT KITCHEN AT ROCHEFORT’S COMPOUND — DAY

Seated regally at the kitchen table Guy presides over a
mountain of leftovers culled from the refrigerator He snaps
open a beer and pours it ceremoniously into a tall glass Guy
takes a sip of the beer

GUY
Mmm What is that Belgian
INT EXERCISE ROOM — DAY
Zoe and Max square off with BROAD SWORDS Max is terrified

ZOE
Are all men like that

MAX
What intimidated by powerful
women

Zoe LUNGES toward Max with a series of blows Max continues
to defend himself
HENCHMEN 47

ZOE
Are you

MAX
Me

ZOE
Yes you

In a practiced move Zoe disarms Max and holds him in place
with the tip of her sword Max raises his hands in the air
staring down at her sword

ZOE
Is Max looking for a penis
replacement

A wicked smile appears on Zoe’s lips

MAX
No no I’m fine thanks

Zoe lowers her sword hovering it just below Max’s waist

ZOE
Maybe I am

MAX
You have a penis

Without taking her eyes off of Max Zoe HURLS the sword
across the room where it lodges in the wall

ZOE
I still need a sparing partner

In a flash Zoe unzips Max’s jumpsuit to the waist and pulls
it down around his arms Grabbing his undershirt she pulls
him close and kisses him violently

Max manages to pull away and retreat to a far wall just
below the sword Zoe threw earlier Max is in a panic but Zoe
walks slowly deliberately after him

ZOE
You work for me Max You’1ll do as
I say

Max unsuccessfully tries to pull the sword from the wall

MAX
Look I’d love to help out really
Youre beautiful Really beautiful
But we hardly know each other
(MORE)
HENCHMEN 48

MAX (CONTD)
And sex which is what I think you
mean when you say “Sparring” well
I want it to be something more than
a meaningless physical encounter
with no emotional grounding

Max still struggles with the sword as Zoe reaches him

ZOE
Really

Zoe studies Max for a moment intrigued Then she pushes in
and kisses Max again He struggles a moment his hands still
on the sword above his head Finally he relaxes into the
kiss just as the sword comes loose and the metal handle
CRASHES onto Zoe’s head She collapses unconscious at his
feet the sword now in his hand

MAX
Zoe

compound the two guards in tow

GUARD 1
They were right here when we left

The Kaiser stops before entering

THE KAISER
This time stay at your posts

INT ROCHEFORT’S COMPOUND — DAY

The Kaiser enters the living room cautiously Still scanning
the room he reaches for his FALSE EYE Plucking it from its
socket The Kaiser gives the metal orb a squeeze and three
blades snap into place He begins to move through the room
his deadly eyeballthrowing knife at the ready

INT KITCHEN AT ROCHEFORT’S COMPOUND — DAY

Guy has eaten most of the food piled high on the table He is
bloated and sleepy a deeply satisfied look on his face He
lifts his plate to lick some gravy

The Kaiser bursts into the kitchen and FLINGS his false eye
The razor sharp blades EMBED themselves in Guy’s plate
HENCHMEN 49

For a moment the plate is intact then it falls into two
pieces Guy’s face tongue in mid-lick is revealed

GUY
Hey Kaiser

THE KAISER
(fuming)
That’s The Kaiser

Guy fishes The Kaiser’s weapon out of some mashed potatoes

GUY
(disgusted and fascinated)
Is this your eyeball

INT EXERCISE ROOM — DAY

Max is still standing over Zoe’s limp body He is panicked
and close to hyperventilating Finally he drops to his knees
and ineptly tries to check her vital signs He lightly slaps
her a few times on the cheek

MAX
Hello Zoe Can you stand

Standing behind her he struggles to lift her to her feet
She is completely limp Max uses his feet and legs to move
her feet and legs Zoe starts to fall forward

MAX
Oh no Oh no

Max tries to stop Zoe’s fall by grabbing her hips She bends
at the waist her top half landing on a cushioned chair Max
presses closer against her backside desperately trying to

raise her up Zoe her eyes still closed smiles devilishly

Rochefort BREEZES through the door his expression turns from
conciliatory to outraged

MAX
Rochefort

Max JUMPS back Zoe slowly stands upright
ZOE
Rochefort We were just talking
about you Have you met Max my
martial arts instructor

Max offers a weak smile
HENCHMEN 50

ROCHEFORT
Instructor And what aspect of the
martial arts was he instructing you
in just now

MAX
Um That’s umI can show you

ZOE
Rochefort please jealousy does not
become you

The Kaiser enters pushing Guy before him
THE KAISER
I found this one raiding your

fridge

The Kaiser SHOVES Guy over to Max Rochefort is furious

THE KAISER
Do you want that I should kill
them

GUY

(quietly to Max)
Who talks like that

Zoe moves to Rochefort’s side using her femme fatale charms

ZOE
Kill them if you wish but you know
what would really turn me on

Zoe whispers in Rochefort’s ear A smile spreads across his
face Unseen by Rochefort Zoe gives Max a seductive wink

ROCHEFORT
Send them to the mines

INT ROCHEFORT MINE — DAY

We are deep inside one of the many mine shafts that cut
through the cliff above Rochefort’s mining complex Guy Max
and Arnold are standing guard over a dozen BRAZILIANS working
with pick and shovel in the dim lamp light and thin red mist

GUY
Blaming me is unproductive

MAX
It certainly makes me feel better
HENCHMEN 51

GUY
It was your girlfriend who sent us
to the mines

MAX
She’s not my girlfriend And it
sure beats immediate death which
is standard issue when you take a
self-guided tour of the boss’s
private residence

GUY
Or jump his girl toy

MAX
She jumped me

GUY
Oh sure That makes sense She’s
shacked up with a billionaire evil
mastermind but she really wants to
settle down with the help

MAX
Hey it was your big idea to sneak
in there and raid the fridge I
could have been killed My God
Guy do you ever think of anyone
but yourself

During the above Guy begins to let out a long moist belch

GUY
My bad say that last part again

Max falls into a smoldering silence Guy shrugs and makes a
face at Arnold that says “What’s up with him”

GUY
(to Arnold)
What are they punishing you for

ARNOLD
Are you for real They gave me this
post fresh off the bus Shit I’m
lucky I’m not holding a damn
shovel

GUY
Where’s Pierre
HENCHMEN 52

ARNOLD
Getting his chair tricked-out with
off-road tires This jungle
terrain’s a bitch

A BRAZILIAN INDIAN spills a shovel of dirt on Arnold’s shoe

ARNOLD
Hey hey watch what you’re doing

The Brazilian looks at him blankly

ARNOLD
Cuidado hombre Nuevo shoes

Arnold gives up

ARNOLD
Must have some Indian dialect

BRAZILIAN
Portuguese

ARNOLD
What

BRAZILIAN
Youre in Brazil asshole We speak
Portuguese

MAX
I told you Brazil or Colombia

GUY
What are you guys digging for

BRAZILIAN
A need to know basis cock lump

GUY
Whoa easy

The Brazilian digs out a pack of cigarettes
BRAZILIAN
I’m just messin’ with you The boss
is a dick anyway Smoke

The three henchmen wave him off

GUY
Is that healthy as a miner
HENCHMEN 53

BRAZILIAN
(to Arnold)
Are you a proctologist

ARNOLD
Uh no

BRAZILIAN
(motioning toward Guy)
I was hoping you could get rid of
this pain in my ass

The Brazilian laughs at his own joke slapping Arnold on the
back Getting no response he shrugs and lights up

BRAZILIAN

Actually these are nothing This
new element the boss found is crazy
radioactive and we’ve been pulling
a crap load of it out of this
mountain

(beat)
My pubes are falling out Look

The Brazilian starts to undo his pants

ARNOLD
Whoa hold on no need why would we
doubt you

The Brazilian stops and takes another drag off the cigarette
Guy looks around and then covers his crotch with his hands

MAX
A new element

BRAZILIAN
Some new transition metal heavier
than Uranium but very stable If
this guy knows what he’s doing it
could end all life as we know it

GUY
You mean he could actually destroy
the world

BRAZILIAN
The world my ass A fusion reaction
with the right energy could
duplicate the Big Bang and rip
apart the galaxy

ARNOLD
Impressive
HENCHMEN 54

GUY
Makes me miss the shit pool

MAX
So that’s his plan It’s fresh
creative It’s expanding the
knowledge of science

GUY
He’1ll screw it up Besides there’s
no such thing as a new element

BRAZILIAN
What are you Stephen-fricken-
Hawking What do you know about
physics

GUY
More than a Portuguese miner

BRAZILIAN
Brazilian I speak Portuguese
dickweed And where do you think I
learned English

The Brazilian stamps out his cigarette and grabs his shovel
BRAZILIAN
I was an analyst at Los Alamos for

15 years

ARNOLD
What the hell are you doing here

BRAZILIAN
World domination ultimate power
the usual Thought the women would
dig it but

The Brazilian disappears into the darkness of the mine

BRAZILIAN (0S)
Job talk just isn’t sexy anymore

ARNOLD
That guy is over qualified

GUY
I’m telling you Rochefort’s gonna
screw it up

MAX
Come on guys This could really
work
HENCHMEN 55

GUY
Yeah and if it does he destroys
the whole freak’n galaxy Were you
listening

MAX
He only has to threaten to destroy
the galaxy No one would be crazy
enough to actually do it As Gandhi
says “The ends justify the means”

GUY
Gandhi did not say that

ARNOLD
That doesn’t sound like Gandhi

MAX
Oh and I suppose he never said
“Might makes right” either Geez
read a book every once in a while
(beat)
I gotta take a leak

Max sulks into the darkness

INT MINE SHAFT — DAY

In the dark we hear him unzip and begin to relieve himself
Looking down and squinting in the low light he realizes he
is peeing on a shoe Confused he looks up to come face to
face with Agent Aaron Sharp

Sharp brings a finger to his lips SHHH

Max GASPS but before he can move Sharp lays a LIGHTNING
QUICK BLOW between his eyes

INT ROCHEFORT MINE — DAY

Guy and Arnold are playing rock paper scissors as Max comes
stumbling out of the darkness It appears that in the
confusion Max has peed on himself

GUY
Where’ve you beenand why have
you pissed on yourself

MAX
A secret agent
HENCHMEN 56

GUY
--peed on you What

MAX
We’ve been compromised

Max grabs his automatic and heads for the exit

GUY
Wait a minute Max

EXT ROCHEFORT MINE — DAY

Max CAREENS out of the mine pulling up short at the edge of
the cliff Guy jogs up to his side

GUY
What’s going on

Max is staring hard at the facility below Arnold saunters up
next to them Max points

MAX
There

We see Agent Sharp DASHING across the open space of the
complex HENCHMEN in pursuit Sharp LEAPS into a nearby BUS
and the vehicle LURCHES into action

ARNOLD
Where’s he gonna go with that

Max watches the bus head for the main entrance then breaks
into a SPRINT down the steep trail from the mine shaft

GUY
Where are you going

Guy watches him go for a moment then takes a tighter hold on
his gun He is torn - fight or flight

GUY
I’ve got to go after him don’t I

Guy DASHES after Max Arnold shrugs as he pulls an energy bar
from him pocket

ARNOLD
Gotta love the buddy system
HENCHMEN 57

EXT CLIFF — DAY

Max is keeping pace with the bus below as it powers through
the main gate sending HENCHMEN FLYING Guy is not far behind

GUY
Would you wait a minute Let’s talk
about this you have no plan

Below them we see two jeeps loaded with HENCHMEN speed
through the now open gate in PURSUIT of the bus

Max RACES down the steep trail until he is right above the
bus Guy is on his heels In another second the trail will
end and the bus will be gone Max LAUNCHES from the trail and
miraculously lands on the top of the bus Guy moving too
fast to think FLINGS HIMSELF into the air

GUY
What am I doing

Guy HITS the back of the bus BARELY GRABBING a railing

EXT JUNGLE ROAD — DAY

The bus is ROARING through the jungle throwing mud in all
directions Max slowly makes his way toward forward on the
roof Guy is still CLINGING onto the back his legs SWINGING
wide with every bend in the road

Behind them the two jeeps are CLOSING in HENCHMEN in the
lead jeep OPEN FIRE on the bus BARELY MISSING Guy as he
tries to clamber onto the roof

Max is getting closer to the front of the bus Through the
muddied windshield we see Agent Sharp eyeing his mirrors
SLIPPING one hand into his tailored utility jacket he pulls
out a SMALL BLACK BOX In one fluid motion Sharp FLIPS a
switch and casually drops the device out of the window

The device plunges into the mud near the road a small RED
LIGHT FLASHING quicker and quicker The lead jeep passes
unscathed but as the second jeep reaches the same point the
device DETONATES sending the jeep HURTLING bumper over
bumper HENCHMEN fly in all directions

As Guy SCRAMBLES onto the roof his gun accidently FIRES a
spray of bullets BLOWING the two back tires on the bus The
bus SQUEALS and CAREENS off the road and into the jungle

The remaining jeep nearly FLIPS as it RIPS into the jungle
HENCHMEN 58

EXT JUNGLE UNDERGROWTH — DAY

The bus is BOUNCING and AIMLESSLY LURCHING through the
jungle It is clearly OUT OF CONTROL Max is trying to regain
his balance as Guy crawls toward him

Guy is halfway to the front Max GRABS HOLD of the railing

GUY
Max

Max SWINGS down to eye level with Agent Sharp Agent Sharp
still calm and suave is trying to regain control of the bus

MAX
Sorry to spoil your

Max is SIDESWIPED by a thick branch and TUMBLES into the
undergrowth Guy tries to see where Max lands

In a flash the bus ROARS into a small clearing Guy turns
his attention forward and his eyes go wide He FRANTICLY
gets to his feet and LEAPS from the roof of the bus

As he LANDS HARD and rolls to one side we see the bus PLUNGE
off the edge of a precipice with the jeep HURTLING after it

Guy hurries to the edge and peers over We see the ground
drop away hundreds of feet below The bus jeep and a few
HENCHMEN are still FALLING through the air

The emergency exit on the bus open and Agent Sharp BASE-JUMPS
from the back His chute UNFURLS and he DRIFTS through the
air as the vehicles EXPLODE on the rocks below

GUY
(impressed)
Now that is a contingency plan

Guy saunters away from the edge

GUY
Max

EXT ROCHEFORT’S COMPOUND BALCONY - DAY
Rochefort Zoe close behind him is watching the mayhem
created in the compound below by Agent Sharp One lone

HENCHMAN runs in terror across the open courtyard

HENCHMAN
Where’s my buddy Where’s my buddy
HENCHMEN 59

The Kaiser appears behind Rochefort

THE KAISER
He escaped sir And he made it out
with a sample from the mines

ROCHEFORT
No matter we have extracted enough
material Assemble the men and
prepare to return to headquarters
Then destroy the compound

The Kaiser exits Rochefort has a slight smile

ROCHEFORT
Nothing can stop us now

Zoe rolls her eyes

EXT ROCHEFORT CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS — DAY

We are hovering over a vast European city A towering glass
building dominates the skyline At its roof line a large
sign displays Rochefort

Title Berlin Germany

INT HALLWAY AT ROCHEFORT HEADQUARTERS — DAY

Dressed in jet black jumpsuits Max and Guy STAND GUARD at
the double doors of a corporate boardroom The cold marble
decor is slightly warmed by the soft muzak version of The
Girl from Ipanema playing and the sounds of a gurgling
fountain We also hear occasional sounds from the boardroom
where Rochefort is hosting his investors

MAX
Your toothbrush I haven’t seen it

GUY
I remember packing it but I can’t
find it anywhere

The doors open A HENCH-WAITER with a water pitcher walks
out We see inside the vast boardroom BUSINESSMEN of various
nationalities sit around an enormous half-circle table
Rochefort is pacing He is dressed for the occasion a blue
suit just a tad too small brown belt black shoes A
HOLOGRAM earth spins in the center of the table

While the door is open we can hear
HENCHMEN 60

ROCHEFORT
with this laser we will jam all
of the communication devices in the
world We will then activate our
own communications satellite
already orbiting the planet

The door closes Max and Guy were not listening

MAX
It’s a toothbrush Buy a new one

GUY
Well

A BUSINESSMAN late RUSHES up to the doors and enters

ROCHEFORT
-I call this new element
Rochefordium It has the potential
to crack the earth’s core or even
destroy the galaxy In a particle
collider hidden in the Sahara
desert

As the doors shut we see Zoe seated inside catch Max’s eye
She gives him a SLIGHT SMILE

GUY
we’ve got this thing today the
gig tonight I’1ll just use yours

MAX
What

The pair goes quiet as the volume rises in the room

ROCHEFORT (0S)
That’s why it’s called mutually
assured destruction Have any of
you read the emails I’ve been
sending out

Max and Guy look at each other and shrug Suddenly Rochefort
BURSTS through the doors Behind him we see the core of the
hologram earth glowing bright red Max and Guy are frozen
Before the doors close we see The Kaiser

THE KAISER
What about his blog posts

In the hall Rochefort is fuming pacing back and forth
HENCHMEN 61

ROCHEFORT
(to himself)
Is it required that investors are
idiots This is not rocket
science It’s particle physics

Rochefort stops closes his eyes and begins counting to ten
Unable to hold back he attempts to muffle a frustrated
SCREAM that causes Max and Guy to jump Rochefort opens his
eyes looks around sees a pen in the breast pocket of Max’s
jumpsuit He grabs it and opens the doors to the board room

ROCHEFORT
(to investors)
Okay sorry about that but I
needed this pen

The doors close and again Max and Guy are alone

GUY
He really needs to get control of
his anger You know he fired half
the guys in Brazil

MAX
Were lucky we still have our jobs

GUY
Lucky You saved our asses with
your little bus-capades The boss
thinks we’re loyal we’re in like
Flynn

MAX
You jumped on the bus too

GUY
Wellyou are my buddy

They both smile while staring straight ahead as the hench-
waiter returns with more water The doors open The hologram
earth is now split into BURNING FRAGMENTS

ROCHEFORT
-And the world will be ours

He and all the investors BURST into maniacal laughter The
doors close Guy looks at Max

GUY
Can you buy floss in Germany
HENCHMEN 62

EXT ROCHEFORT MANSION — NIGHT

Tuxedoed high rollers and their luxury cars roll through the
main gates of Rochefort’s walled mansion HENCHMEN in black
jumpsuits patrol the ramparts with sub-machine guns

A BLACK MAYBACH glides into the grounds and around to the
front door Arnold opens the driver side door Agent Sharp
steps out of the vehicle Sharp hands Arnold the keys and a
Euro bill without even looking at him

SHARP
Keep it up front I don’t want it
buried behind a ton of cars out
back And don’t mess with the radio
or seat settings

Arnold looks at the single bill in his hand and calls out to
Sharp who is already at the front door

ARNOLD
How about I check the fluids and
top it off
(to himself)
Shit I could do this work at home
and see my kids more

landing of the foyer surveying the party

Among the partygoers is Guy holding a tray of cocktails one
of which is in his other hand Sharp passes Guy and takes a
martini Guy finishes his drink grabs a fresh one and hands
the tray off to a passing HENCHMAN Max appears at his side
holding a tray of tiny sausages

GUY
Are those cocktail wieners

Guy reaches for one but Max pulls the tray out of reach

MAX
They’re for the guests

GUY
Come on I need something to go
with my drink
HENCHMEN 63

MAX
You’re drinking

GUY
It’s a party

MAX
It’s not our party

GUY
Thank God Look at these people
They’re more bored than I am
Max scans the crowd and Guy SWIPES a sausage unnoticed
MAX
Remember Any one of these guests
could be a saboteur or secret
agent Stay alert
Guy smacks his sausage and casually takes in the room
GUY
Yeah I’11 do that
INT KITCHEN — NIGHT

The kitchen is bustling with black jumpsuits Max cheerily
pushes through a swinging door with an empty tray

MAX
Need more of those little smokies

A HENCHMAN hands Max another tray full of sausages
MAX
Man these things are a hit
INT HALLWAY — NIGHT
Max backs out of the kitchen right into Zoe

ZOE
Have you been avoiding me

He clumsily tries to keep his sausages from spilling
MAX
Yes of course I have Are you

trying to get me killed

Zoe moves in closer making Max’s job that much harder
HENCHMEN 64
ZOE
Id say I saved your life

Zoe grabs Max by the jumpsuit and pushes him into the wall

INT ROCHEFORT MANSION - NIGHT

Agent Sharp glides through the room finding Rochefort
talking to a group of GUESTS all laughing nervously at his
last joke Sharp taps Rochefort on the shoulder

SHARP
Herr Rochefort

Rochefort turns his tuxedo one size too small and sizes up
Agent Sharp He has a flash of recognition

SHARP
Smith Aaron Smith with Smith
Global Investments I was hoping we
could have a word

ROCHEFORT
Smith is it Shall we retire to my
study We can speak more privately
there yes

Rochefort turns and steps through the crowd Sharp follows
with The Kaiser bringing up the rear They pass Guy holding
another cocktail

GUY
(to himself)
Man he looks familiar

The Kaiser catches Guy’s eye

THE KAISER
You there come with me

Guy drains his drink and hands the glass to a nearby GUEST
He wipes his mouth with a sleeve and follows The Kaiser

INT HALLWAY — CONTINOUS

Max back against the wall and his platter above his head is
locked in a deep kiss with Zoe Sausages roll off the tray
and land on Zoe Max breaks the kiss

MAX
Sorry about my wieners
(beat)
(MORE )
HENCHMEN 65

MAX (CONTD)
Listen Zoe you have some
unhealthy boundaries Well
actually no boundaries at all

ZOE
I see your mouth moving but I
don’t know what you’re saying

MAX
See that right there You have
this idea that it’s okay to want
what you want when you want it No
means no I have food to get out
before it gets cold and you should
be mingling

Zoe impressed by his resolve lets go of his jumpsuit Max
impressed with himself as well heads back into the party

INT ROCHEFORT’S STUDY - NIGHT

Rochefort hovers over a small LIQUOR CABINET as Sharp stands
in the middle of the study

The room is filled with plush leather chairs mahogany
paneling and an impressive collection of hunter’s trophies
including a GRIZZLY BEAR a BOBCAT a MONKEY in mid-screech
and a BALD EAGLE with wings extended The Kaiser stands by
the door Guy looks on a bit bleary-eyed and a little tipsy

ROCHEFORT
Have a seat Mr Smith

Sharp settles into one of two leather armchairs next to a
small table Rochefort selects a bottle and eases into the
other chair He places the bottle on the table the liquid is
clear and there is no label Rochefort SNAPS his fingers in
the direction of Guy and The Kaiser

ROCHEFORT
I think you will find this both
unusual and I hope enjoyable

The Kaiser nudges Guy who stumbles over to the table with
two glasses and begins to pour the two a drink The Kaiser
glares at Agent Sharp and then SLIPS out the door

SHARP
The drink or the conversation

ROCHEFORT
Perhaps both
HENCHMEN 66

Rochefort and Sharp take up their glasses Rochefort DOWNS
his with a slight grimace Sharp SNIFFS suspiciously then
swallows the liquid with a taught smile

SHARP
Delicious

Rochefort motions for Guy to pour them another

ROCHEFORT
It is my own recipe A distillation
process that yields a particularly
high alcohol content without
actually incinerating the palate
No one has ever lasted 3 glasses

Guy holds the bottle up to the light curious The two men
down another glass eyeing each other competitively Guy
takes a swig from the bottle at the same time unnoticed His
eyes go wide and his leg involuntarily KICKS the small table

SHARP
(an octave higher)
Fascinating Now tell me about your
little discovery Rochefordium

Rochefort motions for Guy to refill their glasses

ROCHEFORT
If such a thing existed how would
it interest you

SHARP
I represent certain wealthy
individuals venture capitalists
that may be inclined to invest
They have a taste for investing in
things that are shall we say
unorthodox

ROCHEFORT
(smiling)
Have another drink won’t you

Sharp and Rochefort bring their third glass to their lips

SHARP
So a stable transition metal
heavier than Uranium eh An
element like that in a particle
accelerator the right size

Sharp eyes Rochefort as they drain their glasses and Guy
swipes another mouthful from the bottle
HENCHMEN 67

Rochefort’s lips tremble slightly and Sharp twitches into a
satisfied smile Guy SLAMS the bottle back down onto the
table and spins around COLLIDING into a set of French doors

ROCHEFORT
would yield an awesome power not
seen since the birth of the
universe A power that unleashed
could

SHARP
destroy the very fabric of space
and end all life as we know it

Guy BUMPS into a bookshelf a few books fall he tries to
catch them A large volume SLAMS into his head

ROCHEFORT
or reveal the origins of the
universe itself

Guy STUMBLES back from the bookshelf and turns to face the
stuffed grizzly bear The bear teeters Guy SILENTLY screams
and stumbles back into the stuffed monkey

SHARP
Sounds dangerous

ROCHEFORT
(smiling)
Great science requires great risk

The monkey’s claws are snagged on Guy’s jumpsuit As he moves
the monkey follows Guy tries to turn around and see what is
on his back the monkey SLAMS into a tall standing lamp

ROCHEFORT
Besides you’re not averse to a bit
of danger Are you
(beat)
Mr Sharp

Guy turns towards the lamp as it SLAMS into his head He
FALLS to the floor and out of sight

SHARP
That’s Smith Aaron Smith

Rochefort rises to his feet as the grizzly bear falls on Guy

ROCHEFORT
My mistake Mr Smith You’1l
forgive me but I must return to my
other guests
HENCHMEN 68

Sharp remains in his seat grinning Rochefort turns and
LIMPS for the door as Guy struggles to his feet

INT ROCHEFORT MANSION — NIGHT

Kaiser is waiting at attention by the door Rochefort smiles

at a few of the GUESTS and leans toward The Kaiser

ROCHEFORT
Eliminate him

THE KAISER
It shall be so
INT ROCHEFORT’S STUDY — NIGHT

Sharp is still seated the same grin on his face Guy
struggles to his feet

GUY

Sharp slowly TEETERS over in his chair and SPRAWL onto the
floor Guy stares for a beat then shrugs

GUY
Light weight

EXT ROCHEFORT’S GARDEN — NIGHT

Sharp has one arm around Guy as they STUMBLE through the
garden Guy is drunk but Sharp is barely conscious Sharp is
wiping his mouth with his sleeve

SHARP
What was in that stuff I never

GUY
For a little guy he can put it

SHARP

HENCHMEN 69

GUY

PIERRE
Ah Max tout petit cochonnet The
Kaiser wants you to bring champagne
to the master bedroom

MAX
The Kaiser

PIERRE
It’s a party what can I say

INT ROCHEFORT’S MANSION - LATER

Max is walking down the hallway carrying a bottle of
champagne and two glasses on a tray He gets to the master
bedroom musters courage and slowly enters

MAX
Hello The Kaiser

Max is suddenly KICKED from behind The bottle flies in the
air He flails forward and ends up on a massive bed Hands
CATCH the bottle and both glasses It’s Zoe stripped down to
slinky LINGERIE and high heels

ZOE
Nice vintage

MAX
Dear God Zoe You scared theand

EXT ROCHEFORT MANSION — NIGHT
Rochefort is on the front steps seeing off the last guests

ROCHEFORT
Good evening See you in Africa

The smile vanishes He checks his watch and turns inside

INT ROCHEFORT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Zoe and Max are SITTING on edge of the bed talking Zoe is
swinging her legs like a child still in lingerie and heels

ZOE
Oh there were others Always evil
mastermind types I guess I’ve
always been afraid to be on my own

MAX

It’s not so surprising Insecurity
brings out all sorts of self-
destructive behavior It’s a nasty
cycle But you’re more than just a
pretty deadly plaything You’re
smart and talented You show great
leadership qualities

(tapping her forehead)
Maybe there’s an assassin of doubt
sneaking into your head and
sabotaging your confidence

ZOE
You feel I’m afraid to step out
and
MAX
(interrupting)

It doesn’t mater what I feel What
do you feel You know there’s a
book that I think you should read

Max reaches into his jumpsuit and pulls out a thick BOOK
titled “Teaching You to Love You”

MAX
Have you ever gone on a you-date
Just you and you

Zoe blushes
HENCHMEN 71

MAX
(pointing to his heart)
No I mean in here

Zoe takes the book staring at its cover

ZOE
What about you

MAX
What about me

ZOE
You’re smart talen
(awkward beat)
sensitive Why are you wasting
your time as a henchman

MAX
Wasting my time But I’m part of
something bigger Rochefort’s plan
is blazing an exciting new trail

Zoe smiles puts a hand on his

ZOE
You really believe that don’t you
It’s just a job Sooner or later
some agent will

MAX
You too Doesn’t anyone believe in
this guy
A CHIME sounds
MAX

What was that
Zoe leans back and grabs a REMOTE CONTROL on the center of
the bed She presses a button and a video monitor on the far
wall blinks on showing Rochefort trudging up a stairwell

MAX
Rochefort He’s coming here

ZOE
This is his bedroom

Max jumps up frantic Zoe lies back on the bed unconcerned

ZOE
Let him come It’s for the best
HENCHMEN 72

MAX
No no It’s not for the best I’1l
get fired What am I saying I’m
gonna get fed to feral badgers or
something

Max is FRANTICALLY searching for an exit The video monitor
switches to a camera in the hallway outside the bedroom

ZOE
It’s like you said I should be my
own woman This could break the
cycle Max

MAX
For crissakes I saw that on Oprah
What the hell do I know I haven’t
even finished the book

Max finds one window unlocked and manages to wriggle through

ZOE
Max I want to finish this
conversation

Max disappears just as Rochefort steps into the room
Rochefort stops sees Zoe in bed and the open window

ZOE
Rochefort How was the party

Rochefort crosses the room to the window

EXT ROOF OF ROCHEFORT MANSION — NIGHT

Rochefort peers out of the open window We see Max clinging
to a ledge just out of sight

ROCHEFORT
You left early Zoe That was
disappointing And we ran out of
ice
(beat) )
The little smokies were a hit

Rochefort closes the window and Max exhales He begins to
shimmy along the ledge looking for a way down
EXT ROCHEFORT’S GARDEN — NIGHT

Guy and Agent Sharp are sitting on a thin patch of grass in
the garden still sodden with Rochefort’s homemade liquor
HENCHMEN 73

SHARP
Hey I’m not complaining I get to
see the world an excellent per
diem — and at my pay scale I don’t
even have to turn in receipts — but
sometimes I’d like to be the guy
behind the guy you know Support
staff don’t have to second guess
villainous billionaires bent on
global destruction

GUY
I hear you

SHARP
Some asshole actually succeeds in
redirecting the sun’s energy or
unleashing some super virus who
takes the heat from upstairs

GUY
You do

The Kaiser SLINKS in the shadows behind them

SHARP
Me do that’s right They don’t
care how many times you’ve saved
mankind — let a few million die and
suddenly you’re the bad guy

GUY
I can’t argue

SHARP
At least I’m not you right I
mean you actually are the bad guy

GUY
Now why do you have to be like
that It’s just a job

The Kasier plucks out his false eye and TRIGGERS the blades
with a sadistic smile

SHARP
Just a job
(shaking his head)
Sounds like someone’s substituted a
paycheck for personal
responsibility
HENCHMEN 74

GUY
I punch a clock like everybody
else I’m not the one trying to
take over the world

SHARP
Huh I always wondered how you guys
slept at night

Guy starts to speak but stops Sharp has touched a nerve

In the background The Kaiser raises his arm about to fling
the eye-blade Just before he throws we hear a muffled YELL
A body FALLS from the sky and KNOCKS him to the ground

Sharp and Guy casually glance behind them see Max and The
Kaiser both unconscious on the ground and just as casually
turn forward again

SHARP
Did that just happen

INT MAX’S ROOM — DAY

Max is sleeping soundly nestled in a comforter He stirs
rolls over and opens his eyes to see Agent Sharp passed out
next to him Max BOLTS upright

We see that Max’s single bed in the small cell-like room has
been pushed to one side and that he Agent Sharp and Guy
have all slept together on the floor
MAX
(panicked whisper)
Guy

Guy does not stir

MAX
Guy

Max HURLS a pillow at Guy Guy wakes up disoriented

MAX

What is he doing here
GUY

HENCHMEN 75

GUY

party Nice guy Had a few too many
so I told him he could crash here

Max is on his feet

MAX

GUY
Hmmm he was droning on about

tuned him out after a while

Agent Sharp finally comes to and sits up between Max and Guy
He looks from one to the other

SHARP
Where am I

MAX
You’re in Rochefort’s mansion

SHARP
Still

Max scrambles around the room and comes up with his sub-
machine gun He aims it at Sharp

MAX

Let’s see you get out of this one
SHARP

I don’t think that’s a good idea
MAX

Shut your talk-hole
GUY

Talk-hole
SHARP

If you turn me in I’1l have to
explain to Rochefort some startling
information about his girlfriend

Max glares at Guy

GUY
What So maybe I filled him ina
little but I didn’t know he was an
agent
HENCHMEN 76

MAX
We just talked That’s it

They both give Max a “Yeah right” look Sharp begins to get
to his feet Max points the gun recklessly in his direction

MAX
What are you doing

SHARP
A laser cannon is about to shut
down the world’s communications
I’m going to stop it

MAX
You’re just going to walk out of
here

SHARP

Or you could show me out

MAX
Help you escape Are you crazy

SHARP
You would be avoiding a very
embarrassing and deadly situation
You don’t think Rochefort is going
to believe you sat in his bedroom
and chatted with his seductress

Max thinks for a moment then drops the gun to his side

MAX
I suck at this job

INT ROCHEFORT’S MANSION — DAY

Max his gun at the ready PEERS around the corner of one of
the many rooms in the mansion The coast is clear and he
moves into the open Agent Sharp appears behind him in a
wrinkled tuxedo Guy brings up the rear his GUN dangling
over one shoulder

Max stops at the edge of a large living room motioning Sharp
and Guy to do the same He peers cautiously around a corner
and comes face to face with Zoe

ZOE

MAX
Zoe
HENCHMEN 77

Max tries to smile as he WAVES frantically behind him Guy
SHOVES Sharp through a small doorway and out of sight Zoe
smiles and moves in close

ZOE

I’m hoping we can continue our
conversation from last night

INT ROCHEFORT’S MANSION

Zoe shoves Max through the same small door Sharp and Guy
used Rochefort appears from the next room

ZOE
Yes darling
INT ROCHEFORT’S SHOW BATHROOM — DAY
Max Guy and Sharp are crammed into a very small bathroom

GUY
It just doesn’t make sense

SHARP
It’s an extra bathroom just to show
off Like a living room no one

uses
MAX
I’ve tried to explain the concept
GUY
So you’re not suppose to actually
use it
(beat)

Then why does the plumbing work
Guy FLUSHES the toilet Max and Agent Sharp panic trying to
keep Guy quiet
INT ROCHEFORT’S MANSION — DAY

Zoe hooks arms with Rochefort and leads him down the hall

Max slowly emerges from the bathroom making sure it is safe

EXT ROCHEFORT’S MANSION — DAY

Max leads Agent Sharp and Guy out the front door and around
to a small parking lot Sharp’s black Maybach sits alone in
the empty lot

Sharp lays a hand on the door and looks at both Max and Guy

SHARP
It doesn’t have to be this way you
know You could join me and fight
the good fight

MAX
The Agency had it’s chance
GUY
Yeah And I’m this close to a fat

pension
Sharp slips behind the wheel and looks back to Guy and Max

SHARP
All the same when I foil his plans
and you’re both out of a job you
should look me up

Sharp pulls out driving gloves with a gallant smile

ROCHEFORT (0S)
Extreme measures just to avoid
tipping the valet

Guy and Max turn to see Rochefort standing behind Sharp’s
car his arms folded and a self-satisfied smirk on his face
He is flanked by two HENCHMEN

Guy and Max QUICKLY grip their machine guns playing it off
like they have Sharp cornered With a sigh Sharp gets out of
his car and slams the door behind him
HENCHMEN 79

ROCHEFORT
I enjoyed our little talk Agent
Sharp

The Kaiser arrives with an ice pack on his head Glaring at
Sharp he steps between Max and Guy

ROCHEFORT
But now it’s time we said adieu

The Kaiser tosses his ice pack and with an eager grin
removes his false eyeball and triggers the blades

MAX
(disgusted)
Is that your eyeball

GUY
I know right

THE KAISER
Shut up

Rochefort scowls at The Kaiser

ROCHEFORT
Do you think you can finish the job
now

Rochefort turns away and heads for the mansion There is a
SCUFFLE off screen Rochefort turns back to see The Kaiser
HOWLING in pain clutching his bad eye and Agent Sharp
FORCING Guy and Max into his car with their own guns

Rochefort turns back to the two henchmen Hands on hips he
lets out a low sigh

ROCHEFORT

(half-hearted)
After them

A small machine gun sprouts from the back of Agent Sharp’s
Maybach and begins to fire into the front grill of one of the
pursuing Volvos

The Volvo loses control and SLAMS into a line of parked cars
The two other cars continue close behind

INT SHARP’S CAR - DAY

Guy riding shotgun looks back at the destruction then at
the console

GUY

SHARP

GUY

SHARP

communication frequencies Don’t

could be hidden

GUY
We’re going to die

Suddenly the car SCREECHES to a stop and the engine shuts
off Guy and Max are left mid-scream feeling rather foolish
HENCHMEN 82

MAX
What happened

GUY
I guess it’s like a tread-mill or a
jet ski where if you fall off
or get shot out the roof it just
stops Like a kill switch

Arnold driving one of the white Volvos pulls along side
Pierre rolls down the passenger side window

PIERRE
Bonjour hommes trés petits Need a

on Sade’s Smooth Operator Guy and Max are in the back

retracted

EXT ROCHEFORT CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Arnold pulls the white Volvo up to the building’s entrance as
Rochefort exits with a dozen henchmen The Kaiser steps out
last a bandage over his bad eye

Arnold Max and Guy step out of the car as Agent Sharp gently
FLOATS to the ground in front of them strapped to a
parachute Throughout the following in the background we
see Arnold STRUGGLING with a wheelchair for Pierre

ROCHEFORT
Ah Agent Sharp Late as usual
HENCHMEN 83

SHARP
Don’t be too sure

Sharp unhooks the chute and sets himself to take on all of
them at once Suddenly there is a LOW HUM the henchmen
cower preparing for a BLAST Then a TINY BEAM of light emits
from the top of the skyscraper

ROCHEFORT
Oh I’m sure

There is an AWKWARD pause as they all except for a grinning
Rochefort expected more Sharp relaxes

THE KAISER
(quietly to Rochefort)
Is that it

ROCHEFORT
Yes What

THE KAISER
I don’t know feels a little anti-
climatic

ROCHEFORT
I just jammed every communications

system on the planet What do you
want fireworks

The Kaiser shrugs
ROCHEFORT
(to the henchmen)
Seize him
Henchmen surround Sharp as Guy leans in closer
GUY
(to Sharp)

Are you always wearing a parachute

Sharp is lead away

EXT EARTH’S ORBIT - EVENING

Matlock where are you

INT SUBURBAN HOME - EVENING

A FAMILY cuddle up on a sofa watching their favorite sitcom
Suddenly the screen fills with static Everyone groans

INT WHITE HOUSE OVAL OFFICE - EVENING

The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES stands hands on hips in
front of the Oval Office television as several SECRET SERVICE
AGENTS try to find a working channel

President It’s cable

PRESIDENT
Did you try wrapping tin foil
around it

EXT OUTER SPACE - EVENING

A hulking dead satellite drifts through space With a small
metallic CLICK the satellite begins to separate revealing
another smaller satellite inside The smaller satellite
springs to life BEEPING and FLASHING in it’s orbit

INT SUBURBAN HOME - EVENING

The family still on the couch is groaning in disappointment
as the father tries to find a channel In frustration the
father smacks the top of the set and the static changes to a
rotating image of the Rochefort corporate logo while a muzak
version of The Girl from Ipanema plays in the background The
family stares at it wondering if it’s some new show
HENCHMEN 85

INT MAX’S HOUSE - EVENING

Nana reads a book entitled The Pole Dance Workout while
unnoticed by her the Rochefort corporate logo spins on her
TV screen

INT WHITE HOUSE OVAL OFFICE - EVENING

The secret service agents are turning the channels The
Rochefort logo stares back at them on every one The
President turns to an agent

PRESIDENT
Get me the Joint Chiefs of Staff

The President sits down uneasily watching the rotating logo
on the screen as the agent exits

(calling after the agent)
And some pretzels if we have ‘em

He settles back to watch the logo bobbing his head slightly
to the muzak tune

EXT SAHARA DESERT — DAY

We are high above a low-slung concrete encampment hidden
among the dunes of the Saraha desert We can see several long
rectangular buildings as well as one large concrete oval
extending several miles out into the desert

Title Sahara Desert Southern Egypt

EXT ROCHEFORT’S SAHARA FACILITY — DAY

Down among the concrete bunkers we see dozens of HENCHMEN in
white jumpsuits SCURRY from building to building several of
them riding SEGWAYS Jeeps ZIP here and there the occasional
shuttle bus lumbers past One of the henchmen on a Segway
loses control and CRASHES into a dumpster

On the outskirts of the facility a couple dozen HENCHMEN are
stripped to the waist in their white jumpsuits sunbathing and
playing beach VOLLEYBALL Their bodies are oiled and rippling
with muscles as they LUNGE in SLOW MOTION for the ball We
hear KENNY LOGGINS’ “Playing with the Boys” the volleyball
theme song from Top Gun BLARING over the beach party

Off to the side Guy and Max are SITTING in lawn chairs
enjoying the sun
HENCHMEN 86

Guy has a reflective board angled up at his face and Max is
busy reading My Hero Myself A HIBACHI GRILL is SIZZLING
with hot dogs Just behind them Arnold is begrudgingly
RUBBING sun-block on Pierre

PIERRE
Be thorough I burn easily

ARNOLD
I know the feeling

Max puts down his book something is bothering him

MAX
Guy
GUY
Yeah
MAX
What exactly is mutually assured
destruction
GUY

Basically when both parties will
be destroyed if engaged such that
neither party is willing to
initiate It’s political checkmate
that insures against unprovoked
aggression

ARNOLD
How are the wieners

Max CRANES his neck to see the grill

MAX
Another few minutes
(to Guy)
So mutually assured destruction
only works if everyone has the same
capability

GUY
Something like that

MAX
But if Rochefort is the only one
with the new element then
destruction is not mutual Making
any demands would be like putting a
gun to your own head and demanding
a ransom
HENCHMEN 87

GUY
Hey man I just work here

MAX
I don’t get the angle

ARNOLD
(butting in)
Max there is no angle He’s a
moron

Max turns to Arnold prepared to defend Rochefort but thinks
better of it He returns to soaking up the sun

MAX
You know I’m a little surprised we
didn’t get a “job well done” back
in Berlin

GUY
We were helping the secret agent
escape
MAX
He didn’t know that
(beat)

Maybe you’re right I should just
keep my head down stay out of the
shit and enjoy the fringe benefits

Guy sits up troubled He tries to find the words

GUY
Look Max there’s no shame in
taking a job seriously

Max looks over at Guy and smiles

MAX
Thanks

A volleyball FLIES into view BOUNCING violently off of
Pierre’s head Arnold turns

several consoles Plate glass windows look down upon the
large CONCRETE OVAL Above the windows jumbotron screens
display information on the impending particle collision and
various shots from around the facility

A CAMERA stands on a tripod pointing at one of the consoles
as Rochefort and The Kaiser his bad eye still wounded
prepare for their broadcast to the world The Kaiser hovers
over Rochefort who is looking over his NOTES

The Kaiser’s false eye FALLS out He catches it clumsily and
tries to suavely replace it in its socket

ROCHEFORT
Seriously that eye thing is
disturbing

Rochefort shakes his head while The Kaiser gives him a
sheepish look

ROCHEFORT
(looking at his notes)
Shouldn’t it sound more menacing

THE KAISER
It’s all in the delivery

ROCHEFORT
Yes but I’m just not sure “almost
certain annihilation” really
communicates the truth of the
piece

A CAMERAMAN looks up

CAMERAMAN
We’re ready to uplink

Rochefort TOSSES his notes on he floor and then with his
foot tries to PUSH them out of the camera shot

THE KAISER
Remember r-r-round tones
HENCHMEN 89

ROCHEFORT
Yes yes Oh grab me a water

CAMERAMAN

from Rochefort’s boardroom As they enter a HENCHMAN on a
Segway attempts to exit but SLAMS into the door

As the businessmen make their way toward the stairs of the
metal platform Rochefort LEAPS from his chair to greet them

ROCHEFORT
Ah gentlemen welcome to our
control room

Zoe and the businessmen climb the stairs and join Rochefort
on the platform He points to the screens overhead

ROCHEFORT
As you can all see from here we
can monitor every subtle reaction
in the fusion process down to the
molecular level

BUSINESSMAN 1
Is it safe

ROCHEFORT
Safe

Rochefort steps to one of the control panels and points to a
large red button

ROCHEFORT

With the touch of this button I
will unleash the world’s most
destructive element capable of
destroying everything - everything -
in the known world Is it safe

(beat)
Sure

The men all smile and nod approvingly

ROCHEFORT
And you will be pleased to know
that I have a little entertainment
set up for you during the
experiment

Rochefort motions to one of the screens and we see Agent
Sharp CHAINED inside a concrete tunnel surrounded by
mechanical equipment
HENCHMEN 92

ROCHEFORT
The agent you were all so worried
about is at this moment locked
inside the particle accelerator We
have no idea of the effects of
molecular fusion on the human body
but I bet it leaves a mark

The Kaiser standing near Rochefort adjusts his false eye
Rochefort notices and GLARES at The Kaiser who quickly drops
his hand

BUSINESSMAN 1
So now we broadcast a test run to
show the world what kind of
destructive power we have

ROCHEFORT
Gentlemen really What good is a
test run

To show the world what kind of
destructive

So Rochefort really is insane
(shaking his head)
I am such an idiot

ZOE
I never thought I’d hear myself say
this but we’ve got to free agent
Sharp and figure out how to stop

Max tears himself away from his own self-pity long enough to
look at Zoe

MAX
Why Sharp doesn’t need our help
We’re background

What about all your talk about
being part of real change making a
difference

Max moves in close puts a hand on Zoe’s arm

MAX
And stop leaning

GUY
You’re not meant to use your hands
Steer with your mind or your
feelings or something

MAX
What are you talking about

GUY
It’s like the Force You have to
feel it Look let me

Guy reaches and takes Max’s hands off the handle bars

MAX
Stop it Guy I’m driving

GUY
Let go Max Feel the Segway

Max and Guy’s Segway SLAMS into the side of the tunnel Max
gets to his feet to see the terminus of the accelerator
SHACKLES hang empty and a hatch stands open to one side

MAX
This is it

GUY
Where is Sharp

A distant EXPLOSION rocks the tunnel and Max and Guy STAGGER
to the open hatch
EXT PARTICLE ACCELERATOR — DAY

Max and Guy emerge from the hatch to find two HENCHMEN left
as guards laid out cold in the sand

MAX
What the hell happened here
HENCHMEN 103

Another EXPLOSION rocks the facility A BALL OF FIRE rises up
over the concrete buildings and a SIREN begins to sound

MAX
It has to be Sharp

GUY
What

How the hell We’re suppose to be
saving him

Max is already climbing into a nearby jeep

INT PARTICLE ACCELERATOR CONTROL ROOM — DAY

The control room still empty is alive with FLASHING LIGHTS
and the GROAN of the generators Sharp and Zoe have Rochefort
at GUN POINT on the metal platform The Kaiser is missing

MALE VOICE (0S)
Particle acceleration in fifteen
minutes

SHARP
You must shut down the sequence

ROCHEFORT
Why would I want to do that

ZOE
Rochefort this is insane

Emboldened Rochefort laughs then glares menacingly

ROCHEFORT
All my life I have

A garbled YELP from off screen interrupts his speech

ROCHEFORT
(looking up)
What the

From the shadows we see Max SWINGING in from the rafters on
his pocket grappling hook - Guy CLINGS to his waist like a
frightened lemur

They COLLIDE into Rochefort sending him SPRAWLING Max gets
to his feet triumphant Guy looks on sheepishly as Zoe and
Sharp SHAKE their heads their guns still aimed at Rochefort

HENCHMEN 104

SHARP
That really wasn’t necessary

ZOE
Max we had him at gun point

Max suddenly mortified tries to help Rochefort to his feet

ROCHEFORT
What the hell is going on

MAX
(to Sharp and Zoe)
Sorry guys Just trying to help

GUY
This was all his idea

Rochefort completely flustered is nursing a hurt elbow

ROCHEFORT
These are my men aren’t they

Max turns discreetly to Guy

MAX
(surprised)
Hey he knows us

GUY
(quietly to Max)
Like the jumpsuits aren’t a dead
give-away

SHARP
Can we please focus on the
impending destruction of the en
galaxy

ROCHEFORT

(glaring at Max)
What I was going to say before I
was so rudely interrupted was that
I’ve already begun the acceleration
sequence and it cannot be stopped
once it is started

(to Sharp)
Youve already lost Agent Sharp

THE KAISER (0S)
Yes Agent Sharp You have lost

The Kaiser appears behind Sharp an automatic pistol aimed at
his head Sharp lowers his gun to his side
HENCHMEN 105

Rochefort LUNGES for Zoe’s gun wrenching it from her hands
then pointing it at her head

ROCHEFORT
Well it’s about time

The Kaiser takes Sharp’s gun then steps back keeping Sharp
Max and Guy in his sights

THE KAISER
My apologies but I was negotiating
with striking henchmen

ROCHEFORT
Negotiating Why don’t you just
shoot them

THE KAISER
Well that’s actually what I meant
by “negotiating” I was trying to
be oblique and menacing

Rochefort backs toward an exit still holding Zoe hostage

ROCHEFORT
Well I’1l leave you to negotiate
with these three

The Kaiser grins maniacally as Rochefort backs out the door

THE KAISER
With pleasure

ROCHEFORT
Farewell Agent Sharp
(awkward beat)
And youtwo anonymous henchmen

Max desperate to go after them is held in check by The
Kaiser Sharp hands raised does nothing

THE KAISER
I will take great pleasure in
taking your lives One of the perks
of the job really

Guy looks from Max to Sharp to The Kaiser

GUY
(to The Kaiser)
Look I just want you to know this
is nothing personal
HENCHMEN 106

The Kaiser begins to laugh In a FLASH Guy UNLEASHES an
amazing flurry of MARTIAL ARTS moves catching The Kaiser
completely off guard Soon The Kaiser is LAID OUT cold and
Guy stands in a JOHN WOO pose as a white dove flies past him

GUY

Maybe it was a little personal
SHARP

Nice moves
MAX

I didn’t knowwhen did youthe

Rochefort spins around waving the gun

ROCHEFORT

The henchmen keep their distance Rochefort moves to his hi-

XM radio He FORCES Zoe in and climbs behind the wheel

Max APPEARS in the crowd as Rochefort SPEEDS away

MAX

MAX

The henchmen stand there SILENT and a little CONFUSED

then Max Arnold and the other henchmen DASH after Rochefort
Except Pierre - his wheelchair is STUCK in the sand

PIERRE

EXT ROCHEFORDIUM STORAGE FACILITY - DAY

Rochefort SLAMS on the brakes of the jeep in front of a large
metal gate He LEAPS from the sand jeep to open the gate but
it is LOCKED tight Rochefort about to climb in and ram the
gates sees Max and the other henchmen RUNNING after them

He sees a door to a large concrete building with a SIGN that
reads Rochefordium Storage Facility - Contamination Danger -
Keep Out He GRABS Zoe and RUSHES into the building

INT ROCHEFORDIUM STORAGE FACILITY - DAY

Rochefort PULLS Zoe down a metal catwalk It dead-ends
overlooking a large glass enclosure filled with glowing green
fragments of Rochefordium Generators on all sides send
SPARKS into the enclosure agitating the fragments and
casting an eerie LIGHT around the facility

Rochefort looks down not happy

ROCHEFORT

behind As Rochefort SPINS to face them Zoe PULLS AWAY
HENCHMEN 108

nowhere else to go

ROCHEFORT
No you’ve got nowhere else to go

Zoe joins Max at his side as he and Rochefort keep their
guns trained on each other Arnold and the other henchmen
move in behind Max as he turns and looks into Zoe’s eyes

MAX
Zoe I know who I am now It’s time
I made some decisions for myself

Zoe smiles tenderly and touches his cheek Just when it
teeters on sappy

ROCHEFORT
You have to be freak’n kidding me

ZOE
HENCHMEN 110

Max TURNS from Zoe to Rochefort He AIMS his gun and PULLS
the trigger but there is only a SOFT CLICK Max STARES at
the empty gun as Rochefort laughs RAGE washes over Max

Max THROWS the gun at Rochefort distracting him long enough
to ATTACK

In a series of precise moves Max DISARMS Rochefort and
PUMMELS him back onto the railing of the catwalk

MAX
I don’t care what Gandhi says the
ends do not justify the means

ROCHEFORT
What

MAX
You’re finished Rochefort

ROCHEFORT
You can’t stop me You’re just a
henchman I define you A henchman
without an evil mastermind is like
a a donut without a hole

MAX
I’m my own hole now you son-of-a-

With a frenzy of blows Max CATAPULTS Rochefort over the
railing His body FALLS into the enclosure below SHATTERING
the glass and IMPALING on the jagged shards of Rocheforidum

stately older woman and her two VICE COMMANDERS

COMMANDER
And what of this new element

SHARP
Well madam Rochefort’s
understanding of his own discovery
was lacking Our preliminary
findings suggest the new element is
stranger than he ever guessed

Sharp continues Our focus DRIFTS to the back of the room
HENCHMEN 114

SHARP (0S)
Rochefordium’s fusion reaction did
not crack the planet’s core in
fact it actually repaired the hole
in the ozone layer It seems also
to have reversed ocean pollution
and cured Diabetes

We see Guy and Max standing at the back of the room They are
wearing stylish BLACK SUITS with pinned ID badges Max is
GRINNING while Guy pulls at his collar

GUY
Hey is it hot in here to you

missing it

GUY
Missing what You were there
