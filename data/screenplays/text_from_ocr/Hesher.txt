TJ and Nicole sit on the edge of the pool with their legs
dangling in the water Theyre fully clothed and soaking

He walks off around the side of the house looking for more

things to break

There is an awkward silent moment between TJ and Nicole TJ
looks down and notices a small army of ants marching along

side of the pool He manages to get one to crawl onto the
finger

NICOLE
So how do you know this guy

TI
I dont know hes sort of moved into
my grandmas house with us

( )

NICOLE
What like hes renting a room or
something
TJ

No not really I dont know its
kinda a long story

TJ flicks the ant off of his finger then another one thats
climbing up his arm

NICOLE
Do you realize that the equivalent to
you flicking that ant would be like
one of us getting hit in the face by a
giant wrecking ball at 100 miles an
hour and getting thrown into the next
yard

TJ stops mid ant flicking

TJ
Sorry I

NICOLE
Do you think the other ants are gonna
wonder where that ants gone Do you
think their gonna miss her

TJ doesnt know how to answer

Hesher reappears with a container of lighter fluid and goes
to

the diving board He climbs on and squirts the lighter fluid

through his lighter sending streams of flames into the
pool

Hesher douses the diving board with lighter fluid and
ignites it
with his lighter The diving board erupts into flames

NICOLE (CONTD)
Jesus Christ

HESHER
(SINGING)
Jump in the fi-re

Hesher takes a few steps back then runs toward the board He
springs through the flames into the air He does a messy
sideways flip

HESHER (CONTD)
FUCK YOU BITCHES

He lands in the pool splashing TJ and Nicole He pulls
himself

out and shakes his hair around like a wet dog He looks over
at

the flaming diving board

She lets out a small disbelieving laugh
( )

NICOLE

it
TI

shame

Grandma and Hesher make eye contact with each other
Dad gets up and leaves the kitchen

Hesher shovels some more food into his mouth Grandma looks
concerned

GRANDMA
Did I miss something

HESHER

(MOUTH FULL)
Not really Paul came in and said some
dumb shit which TJ got angry about and
so TJ smashed his plate and then Paul
smashed his plate too but I got a
feeling he smashed his one cuz he
couldnt actually think of anything to
say cuz he kinda knew TJ had a point
and so now he feels bad about it and
so hes gone somewhere
(takes another mouthful)
I dont know where

Grandma contemplates this

GRANDMA
Those boys have been through a lot

This makes Grandma very sad

GRANDMA (CONTD)
Sometimes I wonder if theyre ever
gonna smile again
Tears well in Grandmas eyes Grandma is quietly crying

GRANDMA (CONTD)
I just wish there was something more I
could do

A long beat passes

Hesher doesnt know what to say He pours applesauce on his

food Grandma looks around the kitchen at the mess She
shakes

her head takes a deep breath and starts cleaning up She
picks

up bits of broken plate and takes them to the sink Hesher

watches her

HESHER

bacon
GRANDMA
No not yet dear Can you do me a

Grandma opens her red tin and takes out what looks like a
rolled
cigarette

HESHER (CONTD)
Woah whats that

me with the nausea Will you light a
match for me dear

HESHER
(IMPRESSED)
Hang on a second Can I see that

Hesher sniffs the cigarette

HESHER (CONTD)
No shit

Hesher sets the cigarette down

HESHER (CONTD)
Ill be right back

Hesher dashes out of Grandmas room

After a few moments he comes back and sits on the edge of
the

bed He is holding a glass BONG The bong has so much resin

caked onto the sides it looks as though a thousand pounds
of

marijuana have been smoked through it

HESHER (CONTD)
May I

Hesher takes one of Grandmas medical joints and breaks it
in
half and loads the bowl of the pipe
GRANDMA
What is that

HESHER
Its a bong The water filters the
smoke Its probably the most healthy
way to smoke weed

Hesher lights up and takes a HUGE hit from the bong He
explains
his technique to Grandma while holding the smoke in

HESHER (CONTD)
OK so basically cover the hole here
with your thumb then suck on the top
and once the chamber fills with smoke
take your finger off the hole and suck
in

Hesher takes a quick sip of air sucking the smoke deeper

into
his lungs
HESHER (CONTD)
Then try and hold the smoke in for as
long as possible OK bro
GRANDMA
Umm OK
Grandma takes the bong and has a hit Its a bit clunky but
she
manages to make it work
HESHER
Ok lift your finger
Hesher helps her The smoke shoots into her lungs Grandma
begins to cough
GRANDMA
Oh wow That was a big one
HESHER
Yeah that was good Hit it again
Grandma has another hit It goes well She blows out the
smoke

Hesher takes the bong off her and has another HUGE one for
himself He passes the bong back

GRANDMA
I think Im OK dear

Hesher takes the last hit He dusts off the bowl and sets
the
water pipe down

They sit for a moment and let the drug sink in

GRANDMA (CONTD)
Honey how old are you

HESHER

GRANDMA

GRANDMA
No Im his grandmother

HESHER
Yeah I guess you have a point OK
well I used to have a mouse No
wait hang on a minute I used to

have a snake And do you know what
snakes eat

GRANDMA
Actually theres no limit to the food
items that you can even think of that
a snake might eat Whatever is
available in abundance would become
the prey for the snakes Depending on
their growth their diet -

Hesher cuts her off

HESHER
Yeah OK OK well actually they eat
mice

( )

GRANDMA
They do eat mice A lot of times
snakes eat other snakes because
theyre the right shape -

HESHER
Yeah OK well anyway I used to
have a snake and I fed it mice But
one time I fed this little fuckin
mouse to my snake and that mouse was
tough I dropped that mouse in the
snakes tank and the snake wouldnt go
near him and any time he tried that
mouse would just smack him with his
little you know

Hesher looks at his hand not knowing what mouse hands are
called

HESHER (CONTD)
With his little mouse hand So instead
of eating the mouse the snake just
curled up crying in the corner and the
mouse ruled that fuckin cage And
this went on for weeks the snake
wouldnt go near him That tiny mouse
used to sit in a little miniature lawn
chair scratching his balls and
shelling peanuts and this snake was
just too scared to go near it And cuz
the snake was scared of that mouse I
had to feed him other mice but every
time I dropped another mouse in the
tank itd hide behind the brave
mouse And so eventually the snake
starved to death I had a cage full of
mice

Grandma is stoned and sleepy and fading out

GRANDMA
So is TJ the mouse

HESHER
Maybe he is

GRANDMA
Well then what am I

HESHER
Youre an old lady

Ah I guess

We shared so many wonderful walks and
enjoyed each others company very
much I will miss our walks I will
miss our talks and most of all I will
miss Madeleine I will always remember
what she told me life is like

walking in the rain you can either
hide and take shelter or you can just
get wet She was dear to me and she
will always have a place in my heart

as he claps He is VERY drunk
The funeral director tries to wrap it up

FUNERAL DIRECTOR

FUNERAL DIRECTOR

Hesher pushes the funeral directors arm away hard
HESHER

Hesher gestures to Grandmas coffin

HESHER

There is a beat of silence No one knows what to say or do

HESHER (CONTD)
Im here cause shes been trying to
tell you guys something but you dont
want to listen so Im gonna fuckin
break it down

Hesher takes a long pull from his beer can

HESHER (CONTD)
I pulled the gas tank from an old
Chevy and I wanted to fuckin blow it
up so I did I didnt think about the
millions of bits of metal that were
gonna fly in every direction I almost
bit of

killed myself I woke up ina
hospital I couldnt remember what
happened and then this doctor at the
end of my bed said son and I said
dont call me son you fuckin cunt
then he said you blew off your nut
Some shrapnel had penetrated my left
scrotal sack and ripped the furry
sucker right off My left fucking nut
was gone just like that

Hesher makes a magic disappearing arm gi
beer on the floor

HESHER (CONTD)
I went crazy I assaulted a nurse a
doctor or two I cant remember I got
arrested I got sent to juvie But all
I could think about day and night was
my missing fuckin nut I couldnt eat
or sleep I just wanted my fucking nut
back I had to get out of there and
find it so I busted out of juvie and
went lookin for it I looked for
days but didnt find shit

The tiny crowd listens half offended

HESHER (CONTD)
And then one night I was taking a shit
and I was just staring down at my
balls looking at my flabby piece of
sack where my left nut used to be and
then I noticed my right nut for like
the first time My right nut was just
sitting there totally happy just
hanging out

(MORE)

HESHER (CONTD)
All this time Id been driving myself
crazy thinking about my missing nut
and not thinking about the nut I still
had all along And I realized Ive
still got a nut Ive still got one
good nut God or the Devil or whoever
left me with one good nut At least I

Hesher looks up at TJ and Dad sad and imploring hes made
point They look back at him stunned

HESHER (CONTD)

You lost your mom You lost your wife

I lost a nut

Hesher takes the last swig of his Budweiser He sways

This soaks in with the crowd

HESHER (CONTD)
Fuck this

Hesher throws the can down He goes to stomp on it He
and stumbles crashing into the microphone podium knocking

over and falling in a heap with it He starts puking on the
stage A couple of old ladies are horrified

The funeral director motions to his assistants that now is
time to move the coffin out Hesitantly they obey Hesher
over from the floor
HESHER (CONTD)
Leave her alone Were not finished
yet
FUNERAL DIRECTOR
(POLITELY)
Unfortunately sir we need to be
They continue to push the coffin away Hesher lifts himself
and wipes the vomit from his face and steps toward the
The funeral workers back away
HESHER

with her and Im gonna do it

Determined Hesher leans down and unlocks the wheels of the
coffin stand
and

to

him to

heads

the

does

TJ

in

street

stop

Dad stands not exactly sure what to do

( )

With purpose Hesher pushes the coffin down the stage ramp
down the center aisle of the room toward the exit He turns
TJ -
HESHER (CONTD)
You promised Grandma youd go ona
walk with her This is your last

chance

Hesher seems overcome with emotion he continues pushing the
coffin toward the exit and out through the doors

TJ and Dad watch him unsure After a moment They follow

the door They stand at the doors watching Hesher push the
coffin out into the parking lot

TJ is overcome with emotion his eyes well with tears He
across the lot and catches up with Hesher joining him on
walk Dad watches for a beat his eyes well up too then he
the same

All three are now walking together through the funeral home
parking lot with Grandmas coffin They dont speak Its a
release Other mourners watch from the doorway

EXT FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS

Hesher wheels Grandmas coffin across the parking lot with
and Dad beside him They seem solemn and strangely dignified
a dishevelled way

Hesher leads them out of the parking lot and into the

Traffic passes around them Some cars come to a complete
side of

and
climbs

speaks

and

on

Hesher gets the coffin up onto the sidewalk on the other

the street and the three continue their silent walk with
Grandma

In slow motion the three walk Dad puts his arm around TJs
shoulders TJ puts his arm around Dads

And then a cop car cruises beside them slow The cops inside
watch them Dad looks over One of the cops smiles

EXT FORNEY HOUSE - EVENING
The cop car pulls up outside the house The back door opens

Hesher falls out onto the sidewalk still very drunk Dad

out and steps over Hesher helping him to his feet A cop

to them from the open window

OFFICER
(SMILING)
Youll get him to bed now wont you

DAD
Thats the plan

Hesher squirms and slurs

HESHER
Get your hands off me pig

DAD
Thats the plan

The cop gives them a casual wave as their car pulls away TJ
Dad help Hesher across the lawn to the front door We hold
the house for a beat

INT FORNEY HOUSE BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING
Close on scissors to beard

Dad stands over the sink cutting away at his beard Golden
sunlight pours in through the windows

A moment later he lathers his face up with shaving cream
INT FORNEY HOUSE TJS ROOM - MORNING

Theres a gentle knock at the door TJ wakes and makes a big
stretch His hairs a mess

TJ
Come in

Dad enters hes clean-shaven now He looks like a new man

DAD
Morning Teej

TI
Hey Look at you

DAD
I know It feels weird I can feel air
on my face

TJ
I hardly recognize you

DAD
I think Heshers gone

TJ
Gone where

DAD
I dont know But I think you should
come take a look at this

EXT FORNEY HOUSE GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
and

They

the

Dad

saluting

The garage door is open The garage is flooded with daylight
no sign of Hesher

TJ and Dad walks across the garage to the open door At the
garages entrance they stop Their eyes register something
seriously unusual outside

Master of Puppets by Metallica punches in LOUD

A giant red cube of Volvo scrap metal has been placed in the
center of the driveway like a huge piece of abstract art

stand and stare at it almost in awe

Then from the across the street we see the object in the
driveway and TJ and Dad on the porch looking at it

We also see the words HESHER WAS HERE spray painted on
front of the house in big letters as yet unseen by TJ and
Dad puts his arm around TJs shoulders
On the beat we CUT TO

HESHER MOMENTS
Hesher ripping on the guitar Hesher blowing something up
Hesher cupping a fart and putting it in TJs face Hesher
pantsing Dad Hesher metal saluting Grandma and Grandma

him back

Hesher behind the wheel of his van smoking a cigarette and
making a direct line for the setting sun

A mouse sits an in a tiny armchair like a human shelling a
peanut He throws the shell over his shoulder watching the
setting sun

CUT TO BLACK

THE END
