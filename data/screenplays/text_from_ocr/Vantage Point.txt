INT CNN PRODUCTION TRUCK - DAY

TIGHT ON PRODUCER REX BROOKSas he spearheads the BROADCAST
TEAM Rex is the alpha driven aggressive Beside him is
his associate producer GRACE RIGGS Grace is resilient a
vital quality for working with the hard-driving Rex --

In front of them is a BANK OF MONITORS Each is marked A
B C D and “ON AIR” Filling the “ON AIR” monitor is
reporter ANGIE NEDERLANDER standing just inside the
northwest gate with her back to Plaza Major --

ANGIE (ON SCREEN)

(re to in studio news anchor)
Thank you Mark I’m standing just
inside Plaza Major in Madrid where
crowds have lined up for the kick off of
what is certain to be a landmark summit
Over the next 5 days President Ashton
will be meeting with leaders from all of
the European Union countries in the hopes
of bringing the continents together in
the ongoing war against terror It is
the belief that together Western leaders
can once and for all put a stranglehold
on international terrorism Dignitaries
from France’s Jean Jacques Pierre to
Russia’s Vladmir Rhiechnov are on hand
for this historic event

REX
Let’s bring him up

As Angie continues -- The “ON-AIR” monitor splits with Angie
on one side and MARK REINHART in the Newsroom on the other --

MARK (ON SCREEN)
Tell us Angie what’s the mood there

ANGIE (ON SCREEN)
For the most part hopeful Certainly
everyone here is sympathetic to those who
lost loved ones in the recent bombing I
did however speak to delegates from two
countries both of whom anonymously
took a hardline --

REX
What’s she doing

ANGIE (ON SCREEN)
-- suggesting that the US Foreign Policy
has to bear some of the responsibility
for recent events

REX
Christ Kevin shut her down -- Now

Immediately KEVIN CROSS the board operator begins speaking
into his microphoneand we see Mark in the newsroom
subtly getting word from his ear piece --

MARK (ON SCREEN)

have to keep us informed

As Mark continuesKevin slides another of the 4 cameras
into the “ON AIR” slot The PHONE rings and Grace answers --

REX
(into his headset)
-- Angie What the hell was that

posters in hand the PROTESTORS shout at the camera

GRACE

Grace points to another TV as PRESIDENT ASHTON has arrived

AGENTS as they lead PRESIDENT ASHTON across the Plaza The
President shakes hands kisses babies etc Seeing Barnes --

REX (CONTD)

KEVIN

-- right here

Kevin motions to the playback monitor with the time-date
stamp over a year ago as archival footage unfolds --

REX
Jesus --

GRACE
-- where’s he been

Rex shakes his head no idea He stares at the screen
fascinated as A MAN charges the President and BARNES dives in
front knocking Ashton out of the way as he Barnes takes
the bullet

REX
(under his breath)
I can’t believe he’s back

KEVIN
If we’re the only ones who’ve got it

ON THE “ON-AIR” MONITOR -- we remain on President Ashton big
smile as the APPLAUSE overwhelms Just then --

BANG And AGAIN SHOTS ring out and -- PRESIDENT ASHTON
GOES DOWN

REX (CONTD)
Oh my God

Rex swallows hard trying to catch his breath
ON GRACEthen KEVIN both staring in disbelief
ALL AT ONCE WE SEE (ON THE FOUR DIFFERENT MONITORS)

-ON A-CAM -- we watch as CHAOS fills the PLAZA People run
in every direction --

-LUIS (B-CAM) turns his camera around searching for the
shooter along the back wall of the buildings --

-D-CAM captures the HANDLERS scurrying to protect the various
DIGNITARIES and LEADERS --

-ON C-CAMwe see A MAN (ENRIQUE) as he jumps onto the
Podium rushing toward the President --

GRACE REX
Who is that -- what’s he doing--

Before ENRIQUE makes it to the PRESIDENT BARNES stops him
wrestling him to the ground as TWO OTHER AGENTS take over --

GRACE
C-Cam push in --

-- Barnes rushes toward the President --

REX
Luis turn around
(re Enrique)
Luis follow that guyC stick with the
President

A GROUP OF AGENTS lift the PRESIDENT carrying him out --

REX (CONT’D)
This is insane --

Barnes returns standing alone on the podium barking orders--

-- Rex watches as the camera inches closer before looking
back at A-CAM

REX (CONT’D)
Angie where are you
(no response)
AngieA-Cam what the hell’s going on

KEVIN
Rex --

Kevin points to A-CAM MONITOR where Angie looks rattled

REX
Angie we need you sweetheart

ANGIE (ON SCREEN)
Give me a minute --

REX
We don’t have a minute
(beat)
Angie you’re a goddamn CNN reporter act
like it
(giving up)
D-CAM what’s the problem Do something

ON THE B-CAM MONITOR -- where the SECRET SERVICE remove a gun
from ENRIQUE

REX GRACE
Oh my God He’s got a gun

Immediately SECRET SERVICE throws ENRIQUE off the podium --

D-CAM
Go for D

REX
Hold on D Luis get us closer Angie
move your ass --

ANGIE
I can’t

REX
What do you mean you can’t I’m pretty
sure you did better than this in Jenin

ANGIE
I just need a minute here Rex alright

In the background we HEAR an unseen EXPLOSION outside the
Plaza --

REX
(looking at the monitors)
What the hell was that Damnit D-CAM
turn it around find what that sound was
Kevin get playback going we’1l need to
uplink everything we’ve got

ON D-CAMas he spins toward the outside of the Plaza --

GRACE
(handing Rex the phone)
Bruce --
REX

Yeah I told her Look I’m tired of
being in the middle --

Rex spots a few WISPS of smoke coming over the tops of
buildings from D-CAM as he continues with Bruce --

REX (CONT’D)
-- you want to tell her then tell her
Otherwise hang on

He slams the phone down as C-CAM captures the PRESIDENT being
loaded into an Ambulance Except we can’t quite see --

REX (CONT’D)
No more calls C you’ve got to do
better --

C-CAM (V0)

They’re not letting me through What am
I supposed to do

REX
FIGURE IT OUT

Silence Grace and Kevin and the others look at Rex timid

REX (CONT’D)
Angie listen to me I Know this is
tough alright I know But you’re at
ground zero I need to Know what it
looks like

Her lips quiver as she looks at a YOUNG MOTHER (MARIE) and
daughter (ANNA) being separated by the crowd Marie rushes
toward her daughter -- screaming -- and falling Angie
watches in horror as this woman is run over by the masses
As she speaks Rex orders Kevin to start airing what she’s
saying --

ANGIE (ON SCREEN)
It looks awful People are running
scared
(re Marie and Anna)
There’s a young mother she’s lost her
daughter They’re getting trampled
It’s horrible

Without hesitation Angie runs for Marie reaching to pull
off her mic as she goes --

REX
Don’t take that off Angie

-- before she even gets to Marie Marie is swallowed up in
the crowd --

REX (CONTD)
This is a Pulitzer C’mon Angie A
goddamn Pulitzer Talk to me

ANGIE stops She hesitates Unsure of what to do

REX (CONT’D)
Angie please I need you to put it back
on You gotta get to Luis He’s
northeast of the podium

ANGIE
-- these are people Rex --

REX
And you owe it to them to report what’s
happening People need you right now
They need you to do your job

Beat Angie nods tearfully She’s not happy about it but
she’1l go REX eases back at the sight of her moving --

REX (CONTD)
Thank God

ON THE B-CAM MONITOR -- where ENRIQUE is being interrogated
by two other SECRET SERVICE AGENTS MATTHEWS and JANKOWSKI --

REX watches catching a glimpse of SECRET SERVICE AGENT
THOMAS BARNES and KENT TAYLOR on the edge of the screen Rex
leans forward speaking into his microphone --

REX (CONTD)
Luis see if you can get me the other two
agents
(Luis turns the wrong way)
They’re behind you Luis

Luis swings the camera 120 degrees to find BARNES and TAYLOR
talking With their backs toward him he steers closer we
get a look at BARNES the intensity is hard to miss --

REX (CONTD)
A year ago this guy could’ve walked
away

-- as Luis draws even closer we pick up their conversation --

BARNES (ON SCREEN)
(to Taylor)
There was something else in that window--

GRACE REX
Window What win-- Kevin find me that window

As Kevin wheels his chair Rex watches as on screenTaylor
exits and BARNES turns to a third MAN (obscured) --

KEVIN

(re the play back deck)
Here

Rex turns to Kevin as he rewinds through the footage passing
shots of the back annex --

REX
There Let’s see if we can find what
they’re looking for --

As Kevin presses “PLAY” the PHONE RINGS --

REX (CONTD)
Don’t touch that

GRACE
It could be Bruce --

REX
It is Bruce Just man the board
(to Kevin)
Start again --

Again Kevin readies to press “PLAY” button when out of the
blue the MICROPHONES BLOW OUT REX looks over to THE MASTER
as --

-- an EXPLOSION rocks the Podium The ground erupts Every-
thing is blown to bits The MICROPHONES SCREAM THEN CRACKLE--

REX (CONTD)
Jesus Christ

ON THE A-CAM MONITOR -- all too graphically ANGIE has been
thrown back Unconscious

GRACE
Oh my God Angie

KEVIN
This is crazy

THE A-CAM Cameraman staggers -- clearly out of sorts -- as he
moves next to her He tries shaking her Rex looks away

GRACE
Kevin pull A
(Kevin hesitates to Rex)
Rex you’re not going to show this

The PHONE rings again They stare at it

GRACE (CONT’D)
Rex
(Rex looks back at the screen)
Kevin turn it off

Rex grabs the cable pulling the A-CAM monitor cable from the
feeds The screen becomes entirely snowy He picks up and
immediately hangs up the phone They’re free of nuisances

REX

(to Grace)
Don’t say a word
(MORE)

REX (CONTD)

(watching B-CAM)
Luis go back

No response From Luis’ (B-CAM) camera we see that Enrique
has run off but we hear nothing The camera like the SECRET
SERVICE searches the Plaza --

REX (CONT’D)
Luis Luis
(no response)
Shit Luis

-- just then Luis’ camera finds Enrique Enrique’s running
with TWO SECRET SERVICE AGENTS (JANKOWSKI and PARSONS)
pursuing Luis races to keep up --

REX (CONTD)
C-Cam come in D-Cam are you there
No one’s answering

KEVIN
The blast must have blown the mics --

REX
We’re losing him

ON ALL OF THE MONITORS -- Rex has got Luis running with the
camera (B-CAM) Enrique is well ahead of him

lsewhere (on D-CAM) Rex watches the pandemonium PEOPLE
crying out for help Some injured Other’s trampled

ona third monitor (C-CAM) we see the ambulance taking
off with the PRESIDENT inside --

Rex stares helpless Suddenly he realizes --

REX (CONTD)
Do we have cell phones for the cameramen
(as Grace begins to say “yes”)
Get ‘em They’re gonna shut down this
city and we’re the only window in

ON THE DOOR TO THE PRODUCTION TRUCKas AGENT BARNES rushes
in Flashes his ID

BARNES
Secret Service I need to see your tapes--
Rex looks -- it’s him
REX
Kevin

KEVIN
-- Over here

Rex watches as Kevin wheels his chair back over to PLAYBACK
Barnes follows Rex stares -- he’s here --

BARNES
I need to see any footage you have of the
back half of the Plaza --

Kevin cues the tape As he waits Barnes notices the monitor
which still holds a frozen image of him saving the President
From behind Rex stares desperate to know what Barnes is
thinking

Suddenly it hits him Reaching over to Grace’s control
panel Rex hits the “PROD TRUCK MIC” -- turning it on

-- Grace looks over as he as he attempts to listen Disdain
written clear across her face this feels dirty --

GRACE
Rex

REX
Just deal with the damn phones --

BARNES

(to Kevin)
Stop it there

(answering his cell phone)
YeahAbout what -- Did you call it
in I’ve got it Go

(hanging up into his mic)

Master Command come in Master Command

(reaching his cell he dials)
Washington this is Agent Barnes Master
Command is down My partner is in
pursuit of a suspect We need assistance
outside the back annex

Rex turns to the D-CAM monitor Desperate to capture what
Barnes is talking about he begins barking orders --

REX
(into his mic)
D-Cam turn aroundD-Cam

GRACE

(re D-Cam)
He can’t hear you --

REX
-- Goddamnit Get him to turn it around

-- Rex turns from the D-CAM monitor noticing that Barnes has
backed away heading for the exit where’s he going --

REX (CONTD)
(to Barnes)
Wait

-- just then Barnes stops at door turning around Rex
freezes as Barnes seemingly looks right at him --

BARNES
Rewind that

-- Rex hesitates before realizing that Barnes has looked
right through him -- past him -- over to the D-CAM monitor as
POLICE take to the street --

BARNES (CONT’D)
Oh my God

-- Rex looks over to the monitors as Barnes races off He’s
struck what did Barnes just see

REX
Whatwhat was that

GRACE
-- I can’t get through

Looking at something anything that he can use right now --

ON THE B-CAM MONITOR -- we catch a glimpse of AN AMERICAN
TOURIST (LEWICKI) a small DV camera in hand passing before
Luis’ lens He’s running after Enrique --

REX
Motherf--
(stopping himself)
-- even tourists are better at this

As Luis B-CAM continues he seems ever more erratic PEOPLE
bump Luis as he tries to push past Ina jolt the camera
falls Crashing The camera’s left tilted on its side

REX (CONTD)
Luis get up Get up Luis Luis0h
God This isn’t happening

GRACE
I got C-Cam He’s on his way

ON THE C-CAM MONITOR -- the camera jumps with every step
Rex Grace and Kevin all stare as the C-CAM cameraman fights
his way northfinally arriving at Luis’ camera --

KEVIN
There’s the camera --

REX
-- so where the hell is he

ON BOTH B and C CAMS -- the small girl (ANNA) we saw with her
mother moments ago runs into the street hysterical

GRACE
I got D-Cam one block--
(Grace tails off seeing ANNA)
Oh Jesus

C-Cam whips around just as a car narrowly misses ANNA --

GRACE (CONT’D)
Someone get her out of there

ON THE D-CAM MONITOR -- ENRIQUE runs across frame -- THROUGH
AN INTERSECTION -- and then gone --

REX
There He’s right there Stop

Grace grabs the phone dials quickly They watch as D-CAM
draws closer to the intersection Closer still --

REX (CONT’D)
Come on Turn --
(only D-CAM continues straight)
No No Christ Go back Follow
him Him

Rex kicks the chair Grace looks over phone to her ear --

REX (CONT’D)
We’ve lost ‘em

ON EACH OF THE THREE CAMERAS PEOPLE run scared Rex watches
in disbelief it’s mass hysteria Beat --

REX (CONT’D)
I should call Bruce

Rex turns away from the chaos looking instead at the

PLAYBACK MONITOR which now features the AMERICAN TOURIST
HOWARD LEWICKI clutching the hand of a young girl ANNA

We FREEZE ON THIS IMAGE before JUMPING IN on the DV CAMERA IN
HIS OTHER HAND

CUT TO

EXT PLAZA MAJOR - CHRYON 15 MINUTES EARLIER

TIGHT ON HOWARD LEWICKI’S CAMCORDER SCREENas we see the
bluest of blue skies He’s just outside Plaza Major his
camera exploring the exotic sights and sounds of Madrid

In his viewfinder he sees KIDS waving at him from a balcony
Lowering the camera he waves back and here we get our first
glimpse of HOWARD LEWICKI Mid-40s Lewicki is mid-life
crisis personified Recently divorced Lewicki is desperate
to recapture his youth as he wanders further in taking in
the size and scope of the 100000 people filling the Plaza

Amid the masses he is at once a part of the everyday and yet
completely alone He struggles with the operations of his
camcorder -- intermittentlyaccidentally triggering the
“TIMEDATE” functionas he records images along the
northwest side near where the President is set to arrive

Elsewhere Lewicki’s camera finds a COUPLE making out Alone
Lewicki is fascinated by this couple He watches even as
they whisper lovingly to one another the MAN looks into the
WOMAN’S EYESthis is VERONICA As she hands him something
LEWICKI suddenly becomes aware that his actions border on
stalking He instead turns his attention to --

THE PODIUM
where he zooms in on Mayor De Soto greeting the DIGNITARIES

GRANT (0S)
What are you seeing

Lewicki turns to see British GRANT STRONG Grant is
everything that Lewicki’s not free spirited daring at
peace with himself

LEWICKI
Oh uhI was watching all of the people
up there

GRANT

Remarkable huh

LEWICKI
Do you recognize any of them

GRANT
The important ones How relevant is
Poland really
(offering his hand)
Grant Strong

LEWICKI
Howard Lewicki Nice to meet you

GRANT

(Lewicki nods)
What brings you to Madrid

LEWICKI
I was looking for a little excitement

GRANT
New to it all

LEWICKI
No I justfelt like the right time
(Grant nods politely beat)
What about you

GRANT
Curiosity mostly I go where the moment
takes me

LEWICKI
No family

GRANT
None that I Know of really

LEWICKI
Things change when there are kids running
around

GRANT
Are yours with you

LEWICKI
Oh no uh they’re with their mother
(reluctantly explaining)
We’re going through sort of --

Before he finishes Lewicki’s bumped from behind Looking
back he sees ANNA in front of him with an empty ICE CREAM

cone in ha

nd and the scoop on the ground before her

MARIE
(in Spanish)
Anna I told you to be careful
(to Lewicki)
Very sorry Sorry

LEWICKI
(checking his pants he’s fine)
It’s fine Really No problemo
As Lewicki looks over Anna’s ready to cry

MARIE
Don’t Don’t cry

-- the father in Lewicki can’t help himself

LEWICKI
UhComo se Llama What’s her name
MARIE
Name
LEWICKI
Your daughter May I buy her another
cone
MARIE

No no She’s fine

LEWICKI
It’s nothing Really

MARIE
No Thank you Come on Anna

LEWICKI
Anna
(Anna turns hearing her name)
I’m sorry Lo siento

They turn to go Grant looks back it’s awkward He’s not
the family man Beat

GRANT
You probably’1l want to get back to your
filming

LEWICKI

Probably should
GRANT
(Lewicki nods slightly)
It was nice meeting you

LEWICKI
You as well Have fun

The APPLAUSE picks up but LEWICKI feels out of sorts He
turns to see PRESIDENT ASHTON led through the crowds by
AGENTS BARNES and TAYLOR and TWO OTHERS --

Lewicki sees his opening and steps forward trying to worm
his way closer to the walkway

ON THE SECRET SERVICEBARNES and TAYLOR -- as they clear a
path for the PRESIDENT Seeing Barnes Lewicki stops that’s
Thomas Barnes Momentarily star-struck he looks down at his
view screen angling to get a better shot --

LEWICKI (CONT’D)
That’s

--he stops himself there’s no one to tell

ON THE VIEW-SCREENnow held overhead as the President and
the Mayor meet Once the President has shaken hands with De
Soto he turns to other leaders working the photo-ops while
the Mayor moves to the podium quieting the crowds

DE SOTO
Buenos tardes Welcome Thank you so
much for being herethis is a wondrous
day Today we make history

THE CROWDS ERUPT As the Mayor continues Lewicki notices
that the SECRET SERVICE AGENT (BARNES) appears to be
whispering into his wrist mic

Ever the voyeur Lewicki turns his attention to BARNES He
follows the agent’s eyes --

DE SOTO (CONTD)
Senor Presidente fellow members of
the European Union President Ashton and
citizens of the world it is with great
pleasure that I invite you all to our
humble city

-- Lewicki turns his camera around toward the back trying to
see what BARNES is looking at He searches the back wall

ZOOMING IN -- window by window until he sees

A MAN

standing inside a second story window Lewicki hesitates
That seems oddLewicki turns back to Barnes Unsure of how
to act Lewicki looks around should he speak up He

hesitates glancing over to those around him No one else
seems to notice

DE SOTO (CONTD)
therefore I offer you my City my
heart and my hope

APPLAUSE The Speech is over President Ashton waves
smiles until -- BANG

Shots ring out The President goes down
ON LEWICKI

as it catches him off guard Immediately he looks back --
no one’s in the window A momentary pang of guilt

LEWICKI
I --

All at once he’s BUMPED and SHOVED SCREAMS overwhelm
PEOPLE stumble as others push past trying to get away

Looking down at his hand he feels the weight of his camera --

he’s seen the shooter He can’t quit now Standing his
ground he raises the camera and begins filming again --

-- ZOOMING IN --

-- he sees the SECRET SERVICE lifting the PRESIDENT leading
him off stage As he looks closer his lens finds THOMAS
BARNES eyes wild scanning the rooftops He’s barking
orders into his wrist microphone but Lewicki can’t hear what
he’s saying

-- tracking with Barnes’ glance Lewicki follows his eye line
over to TWO OTHER AGENTS -- JANKOWSKI and MATTHEWS as they drag
the man away who charged toward the President This is
ENRIQUE Clearly local Enrique has an earnest decent
quality to his concern Lewicki pushes closer hearing

ENRIQUE
No You don’t understand --

JANKOWSKI ENRIQUE
Keep moving -- -- he’1l die

Lewicki locks onto this tussle and notices Enrique looking
over to the side

Lewicki follows his gaze and there at the edge of the

frame -- he notices VERONICA the woman he filmed kissing
another man earlier

Just as he catches her in his viewfinder she throws her bag
beneath the podium --

ENRIQUE (CONTD)
(pointing)
Mira Mira mira She throw something--

-- with all eyes on Enrique Veronica backs away undetected
This time Lewicki has to act Swallowing his fear --

LEWICKI
(to Secret Service)
Wait

Just then JANKOWSKI finds the gun in Enrique’s holster --

JANKOWSKI
Gun

Immediately the SECRET SERVICE throw Enrique to the ground
OTHER AGENTS swarm --

MATTHEWS
(to Lewicki)
Step away
LEWICKI MATTHEWS
He wasn’t lying There was-- Step back sir
LEWICKI

Please listen I think --

Jankowski shoves Lewicki back Lewicki’s thrown off balance
by the blow Gathering himself he looks back helpless He
saw herhe’s sure of it His camera up to his eye he
scans the Plaza before finding --

VERONICA

ZOOMING IN -- he watches as she races furiously for the exit
He turns toward the SECRET SERVICE unsure of what he can do
What is he capable of

ON LEWICKI

as he looks down at the view-finder aimed at the PODIUM
catching sight of the red stain that now marks the stage
flats He struggles to catch his breath His heart racing
adrenaline pumping He looks around canvassing the chaos as
hysteria sets in --

LEWICKI (CONTD)
This isn’t happeningthis can’t be
happeningoh God

Lewicki pauses unsure of what to do He reaches into his
pocket and removes his cell phone He dials Waiting he
tries to swallow his emotion

-- voice mail picks up He stands looking at his watch
Trying to figure out the time zones -- after the BEEP --

LEWICKI (CONTD)
Pam It’s me I’m probably waking
you It’s just -- you’re going to see on
the news when you wake up the
President’s been shot Oh God He was
here In Madrid I think I just saw

AN UNSEEN EXPLOSION sounds off in the distance Lewicki
turns caught up in it all Beat

LEWICKI (CONT’D)
Look I’m okay I just I wanted to let
the kids know that I’m fine I love them
very much and I’m not in danger
Alright

He hangs up His cheeks sag his eyes mist He’s
overwhelmed Lost --

BARNES
-- Sir We need your camera

Lewicki turns as BARNES and TAYLOR swarm Before he can fully
hand it over Barnes has it and is aiming up at the window in
the back annex -- ZOOMING IN for a closer look --

LEWICKI
(after the fact)
Sure

Lewicki stands a step away his mind swirling he’s in the
thick of things He wants to tell them what he saw --

BARNES
I saw something Like a flash of light
(looking back at the window)
There

-- ZOOMING INthere’s something lurking in the shadow --

BARNES (CONTD)
There was something there

LEWICKI
I saw something too

They turn he recoils -- Taylor nods okay

TAYLOR
I’11l go check it out

BARNES
I’m coming with --

TAYLOR
No

-- Lewicki turns away He wants to pinch himself he can’t
believe he’s at the center of all of this In that moment
Barnes looks back at him--

BARNES
Did you film this entire thing
(Lewicki nods)
Show me

Lewicki reaches in rewinding Barnes looks in As they
rewind --

ON BARNES -- as he watches the LCD screen Lewicki watches
him He hardly looks down at the viewfinder until --

BARNES (CONT’D)
Wait a minute --
(turning realizing)

Oh my God
Barnes Looks out to those who remain The other Secret
Service -- it suddenly dawns on him
BARNES (CONT’D)
There’s a bomb -- get down Everyone get
down now

As he calls out to the others he moves further from Lewicki
However before he can alert them --

EXPLOSION The podium erupts --

Barnes is thrown back Lewicki’s thrust aside The camera
falls All around the crowds that remain are marred by
debris -- ash and fire

ON LEWICKIas he staggers to his feet He’s clearly
disoriented His hearing is off -- the world is silent all
around him

ON THE FALLEN CAMERA -- as Lewicki reaches out for it
Picking it up he looks across the Plaza It’s like nothing
he’s ever seen As he surveys his eye stops at --

-- BARNES hunched over an INJURED MAN working to save his
lifeBarnes calls out for help but no one can hear him --

Lewicki can’t stop himself now Making up his mind Lewicki
has to do something He has to get involved Just then --

ANNA staggers past disoriented tearful Lewicki hurries to
her grabbing her hand --

LEWICKI
(silenced)
Anna Anna

Lewicki looks around at the wreckage -- scanning for Marie
She’s not there

LEWICKI (CONT’D)
(silenced)
Where’s your mother Where is she

His voice trails off as he looks out -- she might be gone
All at once the paternal instinct takes over Within
seconds he has them both running toward the exit --

ON ANNAnearing the exit looking back crying as they head
out --

EXT OUTSIDE THE PLAZA - CONTINUOUS

Lewicki maintains his run with Anna’s hand in his own He
steers clear of the crowds dodging as best he can as he
nears the end of the block --

ROUNDING A CORNER

They run further away until a SHOT IS FIREDand just like
that his hearing is restored All at once HORNS blare as
they run out into the street

Lewicki pulls Anna back to safety He turns back around and
sees the SECRET SERVICE AGENTS --

JANKOWSKI and PARSONS
running behind him Their guns are aimed up at the sky

firing warning shots They try to shove their way through
the crowds as they run --

JANKOWSKI PARSONS
Get out of the way Move

ON LEWICKI

looking up ahead to see ENRIQUE running away Beat Lewicki
begins to put it together They’re chasing Enrique Lewicki
continues to film pulling Anna trying to keep up It’s
clearly not a winning proposition

EXT CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS

Up ahead Lewicki sees a POLICE WOMAN tending to SEVERAL
CIVILIANS in the background there are a SERIES of AMBULANCES
and POLICE CARS --

LEWICKI
Excuse me Excuse me

-- the POLICE WOMAN turns to him as the SECRET SERVICE run
past Lewicki watches desperate to be involved this is his
chance Turning back to the Police woman --

LEWICKI (CONTD)
I need your help UhAyudame Please
I need you to watch her Her mother is
gone I don’t know where but --
(to Anna)
I will be right back Espera para mi
Okay Just wait JI will be right back

The Officer looks over as Lewicki backs up He catches sight
of the tears in Anna’s eyes as he turns to go He runs off
camera in hand giving one more look back to Anna before
heading

DOWN A SIDE STREET

where the foot traffic is a bit more diluted The Secret
Service are now fifty feet in front of him MORE WARNING
SHOTS ARE FIRED

But Enrique never turns back Enrique angles leaning in to
a turn At the last second Enrique sees something
Whatever it is appears to force him to change direction As
Lewicki follows he Looks down to see --

AN EMERGENCY VEHICLE
With the lights spinning and the sirens blasting The
VEHICLE nearly plows through the SECRET SERVICE As Lewicki

watches the tension of the moment only further whets his
appetite for adventure

As he treks on he watches Enrique rushing across another
street Just then --

A CAR barrels into Enrique picking him up onto the
windshield The BRAKES slam Enrique drops Hitting the
ground hard --

ON LEWICKI

stopping in horror The Driver races out He tries to help
but Enrique staggers back to his feet running again --

-- (JANKOWSKI and PARSONS) close in Lewicki chugs on in
backMORE SHOTS

Enrique evades He moves from the right of Lewicki to the
leftas though preparing to turn down the next block

Lewicki’s losing this foot race He has a choice to make
Lewicki turns to his own immediate left He can see

DOWN A SIDE STREET

where there’s a right-turn one block down it could be a
short cut that gets him closer Without hesitation he
barrels down the side street

His chest heaves his teeth clench He wills himself
forward Sweat now fills his brow as he hears MORE SHOTS
fired from a block over

Lewicki turns desperately hoping the short cut works out

As he makes his way down the next block he sees ENRIQUE
cutting right in front of him It worked Enrique evades
the cross traffic as he disappears off to the left

Lewicki draws closer He sees the ground rising as it leads
to an overpass bridge Rounding the corner he climbs
higher This is his adventure He can’t quit now

Lewicki fights to keep going He stumbles at the curb
barely retaining his balance --

HIGHER AND HIGHER

he climbs Pushing pushinguntil he reaches the peak As
the road begins to slope down again he looks around No
one’s there He checks off in both directions but he’s
alone Just then out of the corner of his eye he catches
sight of someone just below him Looking over at

THE GROUND BENEATH

Lewicki spots Enrique in front of the overpass unaware that
Lewicki’s watching from above

A POLICE CAR DRAWS NEAR Enrique’s caught for sure

Lewicki watches shocked at his good fortune -- he’s
capturing the whole thing Only Enrique doesn’t move He
waits as the sedan comes to a stop and a POLICE OFFICER gets
out of the car Lewicki zooms in on Enrique as he rounds
the side of the car He appears to smile ZOOMING
FURTHERLewicki notices that as Enrique raises his arms in
celebration he has a badge clipped to his belt --

ON LEWICKI
shocked

LEWICKI (CONT’D)
1S he a cop

Just then he hears footsteps drawing closer Lewicki sees
PARSONS and JANKOWSKI their guns out in front

JANKOWSKI
(pointing)
There he is --

Suddenly shots RING OUT Lewicki turns looking over the
rail to see ENRIQUE’S DOWN The Officer runs to his aid

Lewicki looks back at the Secret Service did they just shoot
him Lewicki’s world is turned upside did the Secret Service
just kill a Spanish Police officer

Parsons and Jankowski rush to the edge of the bridge ready to
jump down --

Just then we HEAR a CHILD screaming in the distance
followed by cars SCREECHING to a stop (just as witnessed in
the CNN newsroom)

Lewicki stops dead in his tracks Turning back around he
rushes across the bridge --

PEERING OVER THE EDGELEWICKI sees ANNA standing in the
street A CAR has narrowly missed her --

LEWICKI
Oh God Anna

Lewicki sprints SHOTS are fired behind him but he no longer
has a hunkering for adventure--

LEWICKI (CONT’D)
Anna

he rushes to the end rounding the side sliding down He
tries to maintain his balance but it’s impossible He skids
as he goes -- He hears her SCREAM again

LEWICKI (CONT’D)
I’m coming

As he rolls he HEARS TIRES SCREECH GLASS SHATTERS METAL

SCRAPES AGAINST THE CONCRETE -- MORE SCREAMING as he runs
toward her --

LEWICKI (CONT’D)
Oh God I’m sorry I’m so Sorry

-- coming round he sees a VEHICLE ON IT’S SIDE SKIDDING
TOWARD HER --

-- it’s getting closer --

-- he reaches out --

-- the vehicle keeps coming --

-- just then he grabs her whisking her out of harm’s way

FROM THE SIDE OF THE ROADhe looks back over the wreckage
at what just past her by --

LEWICKI (CONT’D)
Jesus Christ

Turning away he stares -- through the dark shadings of the
underpass to the other side where Enrique is lying on the
ground dead More than 200 yards away we FREEZE FRAME on
this image of Enrique

and with Howard Lewicki’s every clipped breath we JUMP IN
CLOSER ON THE BODY before we

CUT TO

EXT OUTSIDE PLAZA MAJOR - CHRYON 15 MINUTES EARLIER

TIGHT ON ENRIQUE CONTRERASas he walks toward the entrance
a bag slung over his shoulder He looks over at the
PROTESTORS as he goes The PLACARDS accuse the UNITED STATES
of provoking terrorists --

PROTESTORS
(in Spanish)
Not our problem Not our problem

Enrique maintains a calm even keel amid this intense protest
Watching him we can see he is the promise of the future
Young good looking He screams “hero”

EXT PLAZA MAJOR - SECURITY CHECK POINT - CONTINUOUS
Just inside the Plaza Enrique falls into line at the

Security check point CROWDS stack up in front and behind
An AMERICAN WOMAN looks back as he joins He smiles

THE WOMAN
Are you American

ENRIQUE
No

THE WOMAN

Sorry You look American

He flashes his thousand-watt smile one last time as the woman
walks over to one of the SECURITY PERSONNEL (JUAN)

JUAN
(offering her a bin)
Metal objects

She drops her jewelry and her purse into the bin allowing
Juan to place it on the conveyor before she walks through the
Metal detector Enrique waits patiently --

JUAN (CONT’D)
Next

Enrique steps forward Before walking through the metal
detector Enrique subtly shows his badge

ENRIQUE
Policia

JUAN
Uno momento

Enrique waits as Juan turns to his CO-WORKER (PAULINA)
Within seconds PAULINA approaches --

PAULINA IN SPANISH
Do you have your event credentials

Enrique nods handing her his materials She studies his
face then his materials As she does he looks out into the
Plaza spotting VERONICA His eyes brighten at the sight of
hershe’s beautiful However as quickly as his mood
lightened his temper flares at the sight of her hands
interlocked with another MAN

PAULINA
Okay Sign here
(as he complies)
Are you carrying

Again he nods Paulina turns to Juan and gives him the
okay Juan turns the metal-detecting wand off allowing for
the fact that the crowds behind Enrique don’t need to know
that he’s an undercover police officer

Enrique hardly notices the wand as he focuses instead on the
MAN (JAVIER) as he leaves Veronica and heads for the exit
The jealousy thinly veiled Enrique glares at Javier as he
passes --

PAULINA (CONTD)
You can go

Gathering his things Enrique nods thank you and heads in --
EXT PLAZA MAJOR - CONTINUOUS
Stepping into the Plaza Enrique makes a bee line for
Veronica As he ventures closer she glances in his
direction sensing immediately his intensity she knows that
look
ENRIQUE
(baiting her)
You have a glow about you

VERONICA
It’s the heat

Leaning in to kiss her she turns offering her cheek Beat

ENRIQUE
What have you been doing

VERONICA
(motioning to the crowds)
Taking in all of the people

ENRIQUE
Some more than others

-- she looks away she’s not going to respond --

ENRIQUE (CONTD)
I saw you with him just now

VERONICA
And
(he pauses waiting for more)
You saw nothing

ENRIQUE
It didn’t look like nothing

VERONICA
And what now you think something’s
going on

ENRIQUE
You tell me

VERONICA
I’m not having this conversation again
Enrique You’re the one I want Why
can’t you understand that

Looking deep into her eyes he’s lost torn between his love
and his suspicion Beat He can’t believe her not anymore

ENRIQUE
Because I can’t

He backs away leaving his bag at her feet it’s the same bag
that we saw Veronica throw --

VERONICA
Enrique I love you

But Enrique keeps going He fights struggling to get his
emotions back under control Approaching the podium he
comes across MARIE and ANNA In Anna’s hand is an ice cream
cone without ice cream

ANNA
its not fair

MARIE
Life’s not fair

-- pressing forward Enrique reaches the SECURITY BARRIER
that surrounds the podium On the other side of the
barricade MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA TECHNICIANS and SECURITY
PERSONNEL congregate Flashing his badge he’s allowed
through

As he enters he hears a CACOPHONY The APPLAUSE is
deafening as the PRESIDENT of the United States has arrived

Out of the corner of his eye he sees Veronica Just seeing
her pains him He has to look away Turning back to the
podium he sees that PRESIDENT ASHTON has arrived on stage
and has begun to shake hands with the DIGNITARIES

Making his way to the front Enrique continues to survey the
people he passes almost as if he were looking for someone

As DE SOTO attempts to quiet the crowds Enrique takes note

of the SECRET SERVICE --

DE SOTO (0S)
Buenos tardes Welcome Thank you so
much for being herethis is a wondrous
day Today we make history

APPLAUSE Enrique notes Agent Taylor calm put together --

DE SOTO (CONTD)
Senor Presidente fellow members of
the European Union President Ashton and
citizens of the world it is with great
pleasure that I invite you all to our
humble city

-- following Taylor’s watchful eye Enrique turns to observe
BARNES Barnes whispers into his microphone while he scans
the crowds His eyes always on the move As Barnes looks
across he seems to stop on Enrique They lock eyes until
Enrique turns away uncomfortable

DE SOTO (CONT’D)
It is with a sad heart that we must meet
in mourning with those who lost loved
ones recently But we cannot today nor
ever Let the spectre of evil overcome
the hope of a better tomorrow

Enrique again turns to where VERONICA stood but she’s gone

He exhales noticing the moisture that licks his palms
Wiping his hands on his pant legs he turns back to De Soto --

DE SOTO (CONTD)

We must come together on this day in

this renown place to band together for

peace

APPLAUSE Enrique rubs his hands again nerves on edge --

DE SOTO (CONTD)

Therefore I offer you my City my heart

and my hope

The applause erupts as Ashton and the other leaders wave to
the crowds The moment swells until -- BANG

Enrique doesn’t hesitate even before the second shot rings
out he darts into action --

As the second shot rings out Enrique races up to the podium
BANG -- heading for the fallen man

-- his chest heaves breath quickening as he goes --
-- Enrique looks up to see the President closer into view

TAYLOR (0S)
Barnes

-- he’s almost there --

As Enrique reaches out Barnes grabs him taking him down--

BARNES
Get him out of here

TAYLOR
Let’s go move it Go go go go go --

Immediately MATTHEWS and JANKOWSKI wrestle Enrique away --

ENRIQUE
No No I helpSoy Policia--

-- As Enrique struggles fighting with every breathhe
searches for something --

-- there at the end of the barricade is Veronica Suddenly
Enrique becomes more vigilant more aggressive --

JANKOWSKI ENRIQUE
Get -- No wait

-- as he attempts to fend them off he sees BARNES and the
OTHERS hurrying to the PRESIDENT as his body begins to shake

MATTHEWS
-- move --

-- Veronica’s now inside the barricade moving closer His
eyes call out to her even as he continues his charade --

ENRIQUE JANKOWSKI
-- I have special training Quiet --

BARNES
-- start clearing a path so we can get
him out of here --

She’s so close to the podium he can’t take his eyes off her
As she throws the bag her eyes meet his and his jealousy
gets the best of him he can’t let it gohe can’t help

himself -- as much as he wants to stop himself he can’t --
ENRIQUE
(pointing)
Mira Mira mira
MATTHEWS ENRIQUE
Shut up -- -- she throw something
LEWICKI
Wait
JANKOWSKI

(finding Enrique’s holster)
Gun

Immediately the SECRET SERVICE throw Enrique down Lewicki
rushes to try to get their attention --

ENRIQUE JANKOWSKI
Soy policia -- Shut your mouth

As Matthews begins to examine it Enrique looks around
She’s gone--

MATTHEWS
It’s loaded

ENRIQUE

-- please Listen to me I am policia
(fighting them as they brace
his hands behind his back)

My badge is in front pocket Please

MATTHEWS reaches in finding it Handing it to Jankowski
Enrique looks to his side noticing BARNES watching him --

Just then

Barnes

ENRIQUE (CONT’D)
I just want to help --

JANKOWSKI
(to Enrique)
Are you on duty
(Enrique doesn’t understand)
Are you working now Soy trabajo

ENRIQUE
Si I was to be here

JANKOWSKI
Did you see anything Anything at all

ENRIQUE
No

Barnes steps forward edgier than the others --

BARNES
Why’d you run for him

JANKOWSKI ENRIQUE
I hear bang I go --

BARNES (CONTD)
After which shot

ENRIQUE
Huh I no --

BARNES
After the first shot or the second one

ENRIQUE
The second

BARNES
You got up here pretty fast

ENRIQUE
-- No I I --

JANKOWSKI
Barnes he’s a cop

Barnes stops turning toward Jankowski -- seeing the badge

BARNES
-- he Knows something --

Enrique looks over the accusation stops him in his tracks
Jankowski glares at Barnes the unspoken tension between
them boiling over --

JANKOWSKI
(to PARSONS)
Get him out of here

-- Frustrated Barnes steps away -- and Enrique quietly
exhales relieved

JANKOWSKI (CONTD)
(to the agents nearby)
Let’s round up anyone else who saw
something
(into his mic)
Master Command go for Jankowski

As he continues Enrique looks over at Barnes as he now
speaks with Taylor Barnes watches him still suspicious --

Parson begins leading Enrique away Looking back ENRIQUE
looks over to where Veronica had thrown the bag With each
step he’s now moving further awaythe worst is over --

-- he can see the edge of the podium home free As he
begins to descend he turns back to see Barnes pre-occupied
with Lewicki’s camera

BARNES
Everyone get down

-- Enrique looks back --

BARNES (CONT’D)
Get down now

In that instant Barnes locks eyes with Enrique Enrique
begins to backpedal just as the --

EXPLOSION --

-- hits The PODIUM erupts Fire debris shoot into the
air The blast throws Enrique and the SECRET SERVICE to the
ground

ON ENRIQUE

looking over He sees the wreckage scattered across the

Plaza He sees the agents -- some scattered others
staggeringand then BARNES --

-- looking right at him Enrique hurries to his feet he has
to go Now Without waiting another second he takes off
Feet hitting the pavement legs cycling No looking back

JANKOWSKI (0S)
Get him back here --

-- but he doesn’t stop His breath heaves as he sprints
NEARING THE EXITS

Enrique fights through the CROWDS and the wreckage steering
clear of the overturned cafe tables and other impediments --

JANKOWSKI (CONTD)
-- Freeze

-- but there’s no stopping now --

EXT OUTSIDE OF PLAZA MAJOR - CONTINUOUS

Enrique races out looking both ways As he sprints he
checks behind him JANKOWSKI and PARSONS are fast in pursuit
Enrique powers on never letting up He knocks over
PEDESTRIANS avoiding foot traffic as he jumps --

OUT INTO THE STREET -- he skims the hood of a car cutting it
off The vehicle brakes hard as he slides by Nearing the
other side he turns back to see

JANKOWSKI and PARSONS

not far behind pursuit continuing along the outside of the
Plaza PARSONS raises his gun firing to the sky But
Enrique doesn’t stop

PARSONS JANKOWSKI
Stop where you are he’s not stopping

Just then Enrique turns heading away from the Plaza --
DOWN A SIDE STREET

where the foot traffic is more diluted more dispersed
AN INTERSECTION

just a few building lengths away is now the goal as Enrique
hops back onto the sidewalk

Arriving at the cross-section he looks down the street to
his right --

SIRENS flash LIGHTS spin Enrique looks to see the
EMERGENCY VEHICLE coming right toward him but what catches
Enrique’s eye is not the vehicle itself rather --

VERONICA -- riding shotgun Their eyes meet and his rage
returns

THE SECRET SERVICE -- weave through traffic continuing in
foot pursuit As they cross the intersection --

THE EMERGENCY VEHICLE narrowly misses them Parsons is
forced to dive just missing

BACK ON ENRIQUE

it’s clear that seeing Veronica has troubled him As he
runs he looks back just as

A CAR --

-- barrels into him thrusting him onto the windshield The
BRAKES slam He drops Hitting the ground --

DRIVER
Oh my God

-- Enrique cringes as he gets up He can’t stop Not now
his rage won’t allow it --

DRIVER (CONT’D)
Are you alright --

ENRIQUE
Get away from me

DRIVER
Wait You’re bleeding --

-- but Enrique’s not going to wait He sprints on unaware
that Jankowski has his gun in hand and is aiming for him --

He firesmissing

Gritting his teeth Enrique pushes up hill turning --
AROUND A CORNER

as the hill steepens Up ahead Enrique sees a bridge a
block away Just prior to the bridge cross traffic blocks

his path He looks back -- Jankowski and Parsons are still
in firing distance He has no choices --

ON ENRIQUEseeing this as his chance This is his moment
He limps almost stumbling forward Behind him Jankowski
and Parsons raise their weapons Each taking aim --

-- FIRING -- their shots narrowly miss Enrique’s running
low on time He looks up He has to get away Just thirty
feet

TwentyMORE SHOTS

TenFivehe rushes into the street CARS fly past He
dodges stepping across dancing madly with fate --

Until he’s through He looks back as the AGENTS struggle to
evade the oncoming cars BADGES in the air trying to get
across --

He’s free He turns running up toward the bridge--

Climbing higher and higher Enrique won’t let up A quarter
of the way up he looks over the side to see the ground
dropping significantly Without hesitation he hops onto the
rail jumping down

He hits against the side of the hill -- rolling tumbling --
until he finds himself --

EXT BELOW THE OVERPASS - CONTINUOUS

In the shadow of the overpass Enrique stands alone
Preparing his gun so that the firearm is just outside his
jacket he glares off in the distance Nothing

From his pocket he retrieves his cell phone and dials As
it “CONNECTS”

MAN’S VOICE (V0)
Yeah

ENRIQUE
Where are you

MAN’S VOICE (V0)
Look --

ON A POLICE CARwith its lights flashing as it speeds right
for him Drawing closer it slows to a stop

From the passenger side an OFFICER steps out As he locks

eyes with Enrique we see that it is JAVIERthe man who had
been holding hands with Veronica

ENRIQUE pastes as smile on his facespeaking in perfect
English as he moves closer arms extended in what seems like
celebration --

ENRIQUE
As planned no

but casually Enrique lowers his arms subtly reaching
back for his gun But Javier beats him to the draw --

JAVIER
Not exactly

Javier fires Enrique drops to the ground Javier moves
closer kicking the gun out of reach before picking it up --

JAVIER (CONTD)
-- you’re going to pay
(Enrique gags)
Why Why did you do it

ENRIQUE
(spitting back at him)
Go to hell

JAVIER
(aiming again)
After you

MAN (0S)
Freeze

-- Javier turns and fires off into the distance as Enrique’s
head drops to his side -- MORE SHOTS ARE HEARD -- and
suddenly a car accelerates and Javier runs --

JAVIER (0S)
Wait --
Enrique’s eyes dim as SHOTS ARE FIRED TIRES SKID -- and a
SEDAN crashes off screen FOOTSTEPS run past Enrique’s
breath shortens He gasps his chest rising back-and-forth
back-and-forth until it stops

Dead Enrique’s head drops in the direction of the
footsteps We leave his body and move toward the feet

aS we draw closer we rise up -- getting a better look at
the “man” It’s THOMAS BARNES the Secret Service agent

-- before we even get a full glimpse we

soul that hides beneath a hero’s exterior There’s a KNOCK

MATTHEWS (0S)
It’s time

Deep breath Barnes gathers He checks his gun checks his
radio Looking down at his hand -- it shakes The anxiety
returns He removes a pill bottle from his pocket Popping
jt open he stops short He can’t do it Not today He’ll
have to make do without Pitching the bottle he heads for
the door

Looking down the hall he can see that everyone’s left
without him Undeterred he heads to the elevators
Pressing the “DOWN” button he waitsthe door CHIMES

INT ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Once inside the trembles in his hand resurface as he reaches
for the button -- “P” Pressing with vigor the doors close
He checks his gun his radio Deep breath he’s okay

Standing in silence he waits as the elevator comes to a
stop The doors open and he exits heading into the parking
garage Entering he can hear VOICES just around the corner
they’re talking about him

JANKOWSKI (0S)
But that was before he lost his shit --

TAYLOR (0S)
C’ mon--

Taking a breath he presses on --

MATTHEWS (0S)
-- dude had a nervous breakdown --

TAYLOR (0S)
-- six months ago he’s better --

JANKOWSKI (0S)
-- and what are the chances he’s going to
freak out the minute we walk --
Barnes enters the others stop oh shit --

BARNES
I’d put it at 50-50

Barnes heads for the limo as Taylor chuckles and follows
leaving Jankowski and Matthews in stunned silence

BARNES (CONT’D)
We doing this

INT LIMO - CONTINUOUS

ASHTON sits in back a phone to his ear as Barnes and Taylor
climb in A small television fills the background as the car
doors close Barnes and Taylor get situated as Jankowski and
Matthews head to another car in front --

The LIMO begins moving heading out of the darkness and into
the light Matthews and Jankowski’s car cruises just ahead
with TWO POLICE MOTORCYCLES leading the way --

As they cruise onto the streets LIGHT FLARES through the
window HOLD on Barnes as the light finds him The adrenaline
flows this is what he’s been waiting for he’s back

MARK (V0)
Tell us Angie what’s the mood there

ANGIE (V0)
For the most part hopeful

Barnes Looks out The streets are deserted save for
MILITARY PERSONNELSNIPERS loom atop buildings the city
has been “secured” without hardly a soul in sight

BARNES
Thanks

TAYLOR
For what

BARNES

Getting me back out here again

TAYLOR
Don’t thank me yet

Taylor smiles Barnes understands the inference As the limo
turns once more we can hear nay feel the crowds

JANKOWSKI (V0)
Eagle has arrived Repeat Eagle has
arrived

BARNES TAYLOR
Co -- Copy that

Barnes looks over to Taylor he’s not the lead any more
Taylor nods its okay

The Limo comes to a stop Almost immediately Jankowski and
Matthews approach As the doors open --

TAYLOR
Sir
(Ashton nods moving to exit)
Here we go

Silently Barnes follows Taylor out this is it
EXT OUTSIDE PLAZA MAJOR - CONTINUOUS

ON BARNESas he steps out his discomfort thinly masked
CROWDS surge forward as the MEDIA smothers FLASH BULBS fire
off like gunfire He flinches at the memory

Sweat glistening on his brow Barnes looks around He sees
hands sliding into pockets Parasols raised in the sunlight
Eyes shifting Every movement is a threat every shadow
hides an assassin He tries to take a breath

TAYLOR
Alright let’s do it Mr President

ASHTON turns from the crowds and they begin moving

ON THE PROTESTORSthe Anti-American vitriol hard to miss
Barnes moves slowly scanning the crowd the metal fences
groan under their weight anxiety building

His eyes suddenly lock on -- A MAN -- who leans out onto
their path His eyes meet Barnes’his hand reaches under
his coat A glint of light -- and Barnes’ instinct takes
over He rushes forward

The man’s hand slides out just as --

-- Barnes reaches grabbing --

-- Something falls to the ground -- it’s a camera

Realizing his error Barnes re-coils shit He over-reacted
He turns back to the others hoping they didn’t see what he
did only it’s immediately clear they did Jankowski shoots
Taylor a look Taylor cuts him off --

TAYLOR (CONTD)
Not now

Instead Taylor guides them forward into the Plaza entrance
with Jankowski and Matthews falling in just a step behind
leaving Barnes to pick up the rear

EXT ENTRANCE PLAZA MAJOR - CONTINUOUS

They lead the President through a large stone archway Once
inside the shade of the arch they slow as they begin their

ascent into Plaza It’s like walking into a bullring The

arena awaits WHITE HOT and intense And then all at once

Barnes is awash in a sea of humanity

The CAMERA spins around Barnes as he’s left breathless by the
sheer volume of the crowd There are windows everywhere
it’s a Secret Service nightmare

THE PODIUM feels like a world away As Jankowski and Taylor
begin to clear a path Taylor looks back at Barnes do it

Barnes swallows and then nods Barking into his mic --

BARNES
Agents go for count off

SECRET SERVICE VOICES (V0)
East Annex -- Clear North Tower --
Clear West is clear

All eyes on him The Podium inches closer

BARNES
South

SECRET SERVICE VOICES (V0)
We’re clear Ground cover -- good 24
Clear 13 has blue skies 12 is a go

TAYLOR nods Barnes breathes deep they made it

AT THE PODIUMBarnes and Taylor give way so that the
President can greet DE SOTO and the OTHER DIGNITARIES The two
men smile posing for photos The CHEERS drown out
everything making it almost impossible to hear

Barnes turns to face the crowds swathe upon swathe stare
back A bead of sweat runs down Immediately he wipes it
clean

DE SOTO
Buenos tardes Welcome Thank you so
much for being herethis is a wondrous
day Today we make history

BARNES’ eyes never rest He searches WINDOWS He glances
across the ROOFTOPS The entrances the exitssearching
searchingHe continues to scan the perimeter Looking out
as a CURTAIN FLUTTERS in a window along the far wall

Barnes looks over to the others no one else has seen it He
looks back again -- the flutter appears to have lessened was
there someone there Not wanting to lose face again Barnes
hesitates before speaking into his microphone --

BARNES
Back annex the building should’ve been
cleared

SECRET SERVICE 1 (V0)
Copy It’s clear

BARNES
I’ve got a flutter on the second floor
Third window from the right

SECRET SERVICE 1 (V0)

Taylor looks over and Barnes nods trying to appear
confident in control Turning back to the window Barnes
stares focused as De Soto’s words echo in the PA system
Waiting waiting

ON THE WINDOW -- as SECRET SERVICE AGENT 1 steps into the
frame He closes the window (we now see that the man that
Lewicki had seen was just Secret Service) --

SECRET SERVICE AGENT 1 (V0)
The breeze must’ve blown the curtains
We’ve got it

Barnes looks back at Taylor only Taylor doesn’t return his
gaze The shame is hard to misshis glance drops

DE SOTO
Therefore I offer you my City my heart
and my hope

The APPLAUSE overwhelms as Ashton steps forward and waves
BANG a shot RINGS out its ECHO fills the square and --

TIME STANDS STILL -- as Barnes turns to see Ashton falling
Taylor and the OTHERS rushing for him

Taylor shouts out BARNES can’t hear him He can’t hear
anything The CROWDS scream in silence people RUN wild --

Barnes turns back to the windowand in a FLASH of light

BANG -- another shot rings out hitting Ashton again His
eyes never stray locking on the weapon Smoke drifts off
from the rifle’s shaft BIRDS escape the rooftops TAYLOR
screams again

TAYLOR
Barnes

-- finally hearing his name Barnes looks back to see ENRIQUE
charging directly for the downed President Heart pumping
eyes wild Barnes STORMS forward taking him down

TAYLOR (CONTD)
(Gun-Shot-Wound)
Eagle’s down Eagle’s down We’ve got a
GSW Repeat G-S-W

Powerless Barnes watches Taylor work to stop the bleeding --

BARNES
(re Enrique)
Get him out of here

-- AGENTS grab hold of Enrique and wrestle him away as
Barnes race over toward the President --

TAYLOR
We need to move Eagle now
(calling to the others)
Let’s go move it Go go go go go --

A RING OF SECRET SERVICE AGENTS swarm Ashton --

TAYLOR (CONT’D)
We’re picking him up -- 1 2 3 --

-- the President’s Lifted up --

ON BARNESlooking down at the PRESIDENT an eerie feeling
of deja vu The group collectively begins moving --

BARNES
Start clearing a path so we can get him
out of here
(to Taylor)
You got him

TAYLOR

(nodding yes)
Find that shooter

As Taylor and the others lead Ashton away Barnes lifts his
radio barking orders --

BARNES
I want a perimeter set at a half block
out Let’s get local authorities
sweeping through all of the buildings
along the back annex No one goes in or
out without our go

He watches as the others carry the PRESIDENT towards awaiting
ambulance

BARNES (CONT’D)
Master Command I need a twenty on
Potus

It looks bad for the PRESIDENT they’re losing him He’s not
breathing As they struggle to save him EMTs rush over --

BARNES (CONTD)
Repeat Master Command come inMaster
Command
(no response)
Damnit

Frustration rage it all boils over He looks back at the
window then at Enrique Something doesn’t add up Storming
over Barnes confronts Enrique --

BARNES (CONTD)
Why’d you run for him

JANKOWSKI ENRIQUE
Barnes I hear bang I go --

BARNES (CONTD)
After which shot

ENRIQUE
Huh I no --
BARNES
After the first shot or the second one
ENRIQUE
The second
BARNES
You got up here pretty fast
ENRIQUE
-- No I I --

JANKOWSKI
Barnes he’s a cop
Barnes stops turning toward Jankowski -- seeing the badge
BARNES

-- he Knows something --

JANKOWSKI
(to PARSONS re Enrique)
Get him out of here

-- the two men face off Out of the corner of his eye
Barnes notices Taylor returning he hasn’t got time for this
He heads off --

BARNES
There’s no response from Master Command --

TAYLOR
I just spoke with them Potus is secure
In the meantime until we find that
shooter we’re shutting down the city

BARNES

This never should’ve happened
TAYLOR

Except that it did and it was on our

watch

Taylor’s comment stings Barnes shakes his head he can’t
live with that --

BARNES
We’ve got to find him
(spotting Lewicki)
Sir we need your camera
Barnes runs over to Lewicki Before he can fully hand it
over Barnes has the camera He aims it up at the window in
back annex as Taylor joins him
BARNES (CONT’D)
Third over that’s where the flutter came
from But the shot was to the left --

TAYLOR
Wait you saw the shooter

Wishing it were different Barnes shakes his head -- no

BARNES
I saw something Like a flash of light
(looking back at the window)
There

-- ZOOMING INthere’s something lurking in the shadow --

BARNES (CONTD)
There was something there

LEWICKI

I saw something too

Taylor looks over -- both of them saw it

TAYLOR

I’11l go check it out
BARNES

I’m coming with --
TAYLOR

No If it’s nothing let me take the

heat
-- Barnes nods understood Turning back to Lewicki --

BARNES
Did you film this entire thing
(Lewicki nods)
Show me

Lewicki reaches in rewinding as BARNES looks down at the
screen All of the action plays in reverse he tracks
Veronica disappearing into the crowdshe catches a glimpse
of the Agents tussling with Enriqueand going even further
still notices Veronica throwing her bagsuddenly he stops
in his tracks --

BARNES (CONTD)
-- Oh God
(looking out calling)
There’s a bombEveryone get down

Turning toward the others he begins to run --

BARNES (CONT’D)
Get down now

-- the PODIUM EXPLODES --

Fire and debris shoot into the air The AGENTS are thrown
Barnes is tossed aside The camera is thrown off to the side
as he tumbles

-- slowly Barnes gets to his feet taking in the horror He
rushes toward a fallen agent its MATTHEWS He works to
revive him He barks out orders --

BARNES (CONT’D)
We need medics here now

mouth-to-mouthit isn’t working Jankowski rushes over
but Matthews is gone

Looking up Barnes and Jankowski spot Enrique running off
Jankowski looks back to Barnes Barnes was right --

JANKOWSKI
(to the others)
Get him back here --

As Jankowski jumps to his feet Barnes turns again in the
direction of the back annex window As he looks over LUIS
with a CNN camera over his shoulder runs past An idea
dawns Standing again Barnes races for the exit --

EXT OUTSIDE THE PLAZA - PRODUCTION TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
Barnes rounds the corner drawing close to the truck
INT CNN HEADLINE NEWS PRODUCTION TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
The door’s thrown open --

BARNES
Secret Service I need to see your tapes--

REX KEVIN
Kevin -- Over here

Kevin slides over to Playback as Barnes draws closer --

BARNES (CONTD)
I need to see any footage you have of the
back half of the Plaza --

As Kevin rewinds WE PUSH IN ON BARNES as he stops dead in
his tracks There on one of the Playback decks is the frozen
image of him getting shot a year earlier

He stares his eyes locking on the pixilated image of a HERO

a man he barely recognizes a man he’s been running from a
year now The two men man face each other at last --

His phone breaks the spell Barnes breathes deep sensing
that all eyes are on him He slowly turns looking through
Rex like he isn’t there and going back to KEVIN’S monitor

BARNES (CONT’D)
Stop it there

Kevin presses PLAY as Barnes leans in close answering the
phone --

BARNES (CONT’D)
Yeah --

TAYLOR (V0)
You were right

BARNES
About what

TAYLOR (V0O)
The shooter
(Barnes stops)
I’m in pursuit leaving the back annex
heading west --

Barnes’ heart skips beat eyes open wide

BARNES
Did you call it in

TAYLOR (V0)
I need you to --

BARNES
I’ve got it Go

No response STATIC is all that he hears Vindicated by
Taylor’s notice Barnes turns to his cell dialing --

BARNES (CONTD)

Command is down My partner is in
pursuit of a suspect we need assistance
outside the back annex heading west
along surface streets Copy

Hanging up Barnes turns toward the exit as he calls Taylor --

BARNES (CONTD)
Back up is on it’s --

Out of the corner of his eye Barnes catches sight of the D-
CAM MONITOR where a POLICE OFFICER runs from the BACK ANNEX --

BARNES (CONTD)
Rewind that

ON BARNESas he moves closer to the D-CAM monitor There

on screen is a SPANISH POLICE OFFICER with a cell phone to
his ear --

TAYLOR (V0)
What Thomas what is it

Barnes stares at the Spanish police officerit’s TAYLOR

BARNES
Oh my God

ON BARNES -- the shock horror Beat Suddenly the
connection goes dead Taylor’s gone Backing out Barnes
hangs up and takes off --

EXT CNN HEADLINE NEWS PRODUCTION TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Barnes sprints off Rounding a corner he picks up his pace--

EXT BACK ANNEX - CONTINUOUS

BARNES arrives Looking around Something is clearly wrong
Very wrong He has to find Taylor --

-- his eyes surveying the scene he spots an alley way
Taylor would’ve gone down there He sprints down it His
pace more urgent more determined

-- looking down the narrow alley he sees a POLICE CAR burst
onto the road way ahead was it Taylor

Without hesitation Barnes steps into the street and a CAR
BRAKES in front of him Running toward the driver’s side --

BARNES
Secret Service step out of the car

-- he doesn’t even wait for a response grabbing the DRIVER
and removing him Climbing in he speeds off --

ONCE INSIDEBarnes accelerates Looking ahead the police
car is gone --

BARNES (CONT’D)
Shit

-- suddenly it dawns on him his phone Grabbing it again
he dials--

BARNES (CONTD)
Washington this is Agent Barnes

(beat into his phone)
I’ve lost Agent Taylor he’s in pursuit
of a suspect and I need a GPS location of
his cellular

As he passes through the next intersection he looks to his
LEFT and he catches sight of a POLICE CAR 200 yards down
picking up another OFFICER (JAVIER) --

Barnes slams on his brakes forcing the cars behind him to
stop as well BARNES jerks the car into reverse as he
attempts back up the rest of the way into the intersection
he’s got to Keep up --

HORNS BLARE as he looks DOWN THE STREET as the Police car has
turned right running parallel --

Flipping the gear back into DRIVE Barnes accelerates again
Trying to figure it out where is Taylor going

He weaves through traffic avoiding PEDESTRIANS as he
watches the car crossing the next intersection --

-- up ahead a TRUCK blocks a portion of the road and BARNES
veers hard narrowly missing -- he’s got to get closer --

BARNES (CONTD)
(the operator comes back)
He’s where He’s heading for the river

He looks out the window for landmarks the streets are too
narrow there’s nothing

BARNES (CONT’D)
--that’s where everyone is heading

Reaching the top of a hill Barnes look around -- the RIVER
IS BEHIND HIM Taylor set up a decoy --

BARNES (CONT’D)
Sonuvabitch
(back into the phone)
Alright I know how this is going to
sound but they’re not going to find
anyone No I know I made the call
(MORE)

BARNES (CONT’D)

I know but just listen -- you’ve got to
get those agents back from the river
there’s something else going onMaster
Command is compromised there’s no twenty
on Potus --

(no one’s buying it)
Damnit listen to me --

(hanging up)
Goddamnit

Sealing his resolve he slams the phone down -- he’s going to
have to do it himselfEyes straight ahead he hits the gas
hard -- shooting forward --

At the next cross-street he cuts into the narrow alley --
THE POLICE CAR is now 150 yards ahead --

BARNES pushes with everything he’s gothe draws closer and
closerhe’s got to stop them --

DOWN A SIDE STREET

he sees an AMBULANCE leaving cars in it’s wake the tell tale
signs of chaos run amokHe exhales as he speeds toward the
next intersection --

The LIGHT CHANGES -- he’s gonna make it yellow-turns-to-red--

A CAR SMACKS THE TAIL END OF BARNES’ CARsetting it off
course The rear fender hangs scraping against the ground

ON THE POLICE CARas the collision causes Taylor to look
back in the rearview before turning to see BARNES

The two men lock eyes Taylor can’t believe it all at once
the chase shifts into an even higher gear

DOWN THE NARROW SPANISH ROADWAYS THEY GOTAYLOR turns hard
and by the time BARNES arrives at the intersection Taylor’s
already turning again --

FIGHTING TO KEEP UP BARNES speeds to the end of the block
only to look around and seenothingTaylor’s gone --

BARNES (CONT’D)
C’monthink

CANVASSING THE LANDSCAPEhe cruises forward only to hear the
SCREECH OF TIRES off to the side It has to be Taylor --
Barnes races ahead Ignoring all sense of reason he barrels
forward cutting them off --

BRAKES SCREECH HORNS BLARE as he makes it across the first
two lanes of carsheading toward the downward sloping on-
ramp that must have been Taylor’s destination --

Just prior to the on ramp a TRUCK smashes his side door--

ON BARNESas he’s trapped in this shoe box as the car is
thrust sideways he hurtles closer and closer toward a wall

THE TRUCK SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES but it’s too late SMASH
Barnes is jammed between the truck and the wall Catching
his breath Barnes kicks through windshield forcing his way
out--

TRUCK DRIVER
What’s the matter with you

-- Barnes doesn’t have time for answers as he runs forward
his gun out in front --

BARNES
Move

IN THE DISTANCEBarnes can see that the car has stopped
down below he actually has a shot He can make out the back
of TAYLOR in the driver’s seatand there’s a COP (JAVIER)
out in front talking to ENRIQUE Redoubling his efforts
Barnes pushes with all he’s worth --

BANG Enrique falls to the ground As Javier rounds the
car heading closer to the fallen man --

BARNES (CONT’D)
Freeze

Javier looks up and immediately fires --

-- striking Barnes Barnes looks down shocked His abdomen
reddens and as he sets himself firing back at JAVIER --

-- his shot connects hitting Javier Javier runs back
toward the car as TAYLOR accelerates --

JAVIER
Wait --

-- instead Taylor fires at Javier Javier’s down and Taylor
takes off Barnes doesn’t even hesitate He runs forward
firing as he goes aiming for the tires --

-- he hits one and the car skids sparks flying MORE SHOTS --
THE REAR WINDOW SHATTERS --

-- the CAR turns wildly Taylor’s hit -- the AIR BAGS
EXPLODE The Police car spins out of control coasting-
skidding-crashing into the guard rail

BARNES runs closergun drawn his free hand holding his
wound Reaching the car he throws the door open and pulls
Taylor out Hurling him back against the car the two
friends come face-to-face bloodied and bowed Taylor’s
beaten The wounds clearly have sucked the life from him --

BARNES
Goddamn you You used me --

laylor gasps for air

BARNES (CONT’D)
I trusted you

TAYLOR
-- you can’t stop it

BARNES
What have you done

CUT TO

INT PRESIDENTIAL LIMO - CHRYON 15 MINUTES EARLIER

We’re looking at PRESIDENT ASHTON from over the shoulder of
the SECRET SERVICE the agent’s earpiece letting us know
where we are As he talks on the phone we hear the drone of
the CNN in the background

ASHTON

(light-hearted)
--when exactly do we think the changes’11
be ready Rick It’s not like I’m
supposed to be giving a speech now I
suppose I can just wing it I’m sure
that’11 be okayhow much trouble can I
really get myself into

A shadow falls across his face looking up Ashton see’s them
moving through an underpass The MOTORCADE slows down

ASHTON (CONTD)
We’re stopping

He turns to the SECRET SERVICE AGENTS that face him -- AGENTS
CAVIC and SOMMERS (not Barnes and Taylor) No response Before
we can question what happened to Barnes and Taylor the door
opens TED HEINKIN senior Presidential attache climbs in
Heinkin (30s) is the President’s “go to” guy

HEINKIN
Mr President --

Ashton turns locking on Heinkin’s face In that moment
everything changes -- Christ --

ASHTON
Rick I’1l call you back

After he hangs up --

HEINKIN
The NSA just confirmed the threat

ASHTON
Where’s Phil

HEINKIN
The hotel he’s on with the Joint Chiefs

Ashton looks up as another Motorcade passes by
ASHTON
He sent the double didn’t he

HEINKIN
Yes
(to the Driver)
We’re taking Potus to the hotel

The Driver nods and our vehicle begins to move again --
Ashton nods his displeasure is hard to contain

HEINKIN (CONTD)
We moved the speech till tomorrow
(waiting for Ashton’s response
before)
We let the Press Know that we’re
“deferring” to Prime Minister Gutierrez
as we’re in his country

ASHTON
(sarcastic)
Deferring that’s great
(beat)
today of all days

Beat reading the President’s expression --

HEINKIN
We’ve had doubles since Reagan

ASHTON
For photo ops not for anything this big

HEINKIN
(trying to re-assure)
He’s not going to say anything --

ASHTON
He doesn’t have to

The President looks out as the car turns down into an alley
Shadow cuts across his face as they drop down out of view --

INT PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

The LIMO enters The garage door closes behind the car
Standing in wait are two SECRET SERVICE AGENTS and Chief of
Staff PHIL McCULLOUGH The car stops The SECRET SERVICE
step out before escorting Ashton toward the elevator --

MCCULLOUGH ASHTON
Sir -- Talk to me Phil

MCCULLOUGH
NSA called it about five minutes ago
There’s no question -- it’s real
ASHTON

And we Know who it is

MCCULLOUGH

It looks like it’s a local group with
some sort of vague connection to the
Mujahedin Brigade

(beat)
Two weeks ago US Special Forces
uncovered a plot to smuggle a dirty bomb
out of Morocco We took their men and
their bomb and this may be their
retaliation

The elevator doors are held open by an AGENT who steps out
as the PRESIDENT HEINKIN McCULLOUGH and CAVIC step in

ANOTHER AGENT (SOMMERS) swipes his pass card on the elevator
locking out the other floors As the agent steps out of the
elevator he speaks into his radio --

SECRET SERVICE AGENT
Potus iS moving --

MATCH CUT TO

ON A BANK OF SECURITY CAMERA SCREENSas we watch Ashton
from inside the elevator as McCullough hands him a dossier

ASHTON
This is them --

CROSS CUT WITH
INT ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
Ashton looks down at the dossier opening to a grainy digital
photo of Tehuel Suarez in the photo he sits bearded and
brooding with several others --
HEINKIN
(nodding pointing)

That’s Tehuel Suarez AS near as we can
tell he heads up the group

ASHTON
(re the photo)
How old is this

HEINKIN
A few years

Ashton keeps turning as he moves to the next --

MCCULLOUGH
A couple days ago we intercepted an
email between members of his group
Embedded in it were links to maps blue-
prints of the area

As he turns to the next page we see an email threatening the
President’s life

MCCULLOUGH (CONT’D)
(re the email)
It wasn’t until this morning that we
received the threat

Ashton skims it before closing it He’s seen enough

ASHTON
You talked to the Joint Chiefs
(McCullough nods yes)
What are they recommending

MCCULLOUGH
That we go after their leadership --

ASHTON
(skeptical)
Their leadership

MCCULLOUGH
(nodding)
We’ve got a satellite lock on one of
their camps

Ashton’s frustrated that isn’t going to make any difference
right now --

ASHTON
Do we even Know if the order came from
that high

MCCULLOUGH

We’ve got verification of the threat --

ASHTO
But as for where it began

MCCULLOUGH
Nothing yet --

ASHTO
Then why not focus on the ones who are
here who are actually doing this

MCCULLOUGH
We are We’re working with Spanish
authorities --

ASHTO
But

MCCULLOUGH
It’s a big city

ASHTO

-- This summit is too important --

MCCULLOUGH
I know Sir But we’re looking for five
people out of six million We’re trying--

ASHTO
Try harder

Silence Beat The doors open and CAVIC leads them out --

INT PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - CONTINUOUS

Ashton enters He moves toward the window where we can
practically feel the crowds just a block and a half away
Beat he looks out over the Plaza and then the City at large--
he can’t help but feel trapped

Turning back to McCullough he has the television on CNN --

ON SCREENThe faux-Ashton greets FOREIGN LEADERS The real
Ashton glares disgusted

ASHTON
He doesn’t even look like me

Finishing his hellos the faux-Ashton flanks the MAYOR --

DE SOTO (ON SCREEN)
Buenos tardes Welcome Thank you so
much for being here This is a wondrous
day Today we make history

Applause carries As De Soto waits for the crowds to quiet
Ashton notices behind the faux-Ashton Agent THOMAS BARNES --

ASHTON
That’s Thomas
(McCullough nods yes)
I thought he was still inactive --

HEINKIN
-- He was

Ashton’s surprised beat Seeing Barnes has opened him up
The tension of the previous moment seems forgotten at the
sight of his protector --

ASHTON
If he’s back why isn’t he with me

HEINKIN
(looking off McCullough before)
We weren’t sure if he was ready --

ASHTO
You sent him out there
MCCULLOUGH
We needed someone to “sell” the double
ASHTO
To sell-- He took a bullet for me Phil
MCCULLOUGH
And look at him
ASHTO
He hasn’t stopped punishing himself
since
MCCULLOUGH

Look I liked him every bit as much as
you did but we need to know we can count
on him again before putting him on your
detail --

ASHTON
-- and so you threw him out there to see
if he could

Silence Ashton turns away from McCullough dismissive

DE SOTO (ON SCREEN)
Therefore I offer you my City my
heart and my hope

ON THE TELEVISION

APPLAUSE erupts The BODY DOUBLEASHTON waves from the
podium The emotion swells -- until --

BANG Shots ring out The faux-President drops to the
ground ASHTON watches His own mortality all too apparent

Long silence

ASHTON
(re the Joint Chief’s
recommendations)
Tell me who we’re going after

McCullough nods however as he starts talking the
President’s eye is drawn back to the television

PUSH IN ON ASHTON

as he stares McCullough speaks in the background but right
now he can’t be heard Ashton’s mind is adrift lost --

ON SCREEN
Barnes rushes to aid the body double this is deja vu

ASHTON (CONTD)

MCCULLOUGH
Mr President

Ashton gathers himself he wants someone to paysomeone has
to pay Turning back toward McCullough --

MCCULLOUGH (CONTD)
The Joint Chiefs have a satellite lock on
one of the Mujahedin campsthey’re
ready to go

Ashton looks over to Heinkin who appears skeptical

ASHTON
(re Heinkin)
What’s the problem

MCCULLOUGH
There’s an issue with when we can go--
ASHTON
Go now --
HEINKIN
You can’t give the order
(ironic)

You’ve been shot If we go now we risk
telling the world that you weren’t there

ASHTON

I don’t care I want that order given
HEINKIN

Sir --
ASHTON

Kevin will work up a story --

HEINKIN
That’s not going to fly

ASHTON
Damnit we need to be at that summit So
if we have to go to some goddamn hospital
and put on a show about how I’m okay
then that’s what we’1l dobut we are
not sitting this one out

Heinkin looks over to McCullough

MCCULLOUGH
I think we need to talk about this --

ASHTON
I’m done talking The sooner we get the
word out that I’m okay the better --

We HEAR a CAR BOMB EXPLODE some seven stories below (the same
unseen explosion that CNN picked up on) Windows shatter --

MCCULLOUGH
Holy Christ --

Standing he looks out at the chaos -- FIRE WRECKAGE --

People have been thrown by the fury of the blast it’s clear
what he has to do

CAVIC
Mr President please step away from the
glass --

Ashton turns back to his staff while CAVIC radios the
SECURITY ROOM --

CAVIC (CONT’D)
Cavic to Security Room --

ASHTON

(lethal re the Joint-Chiefs)
Call the Joint Chiefs We’re ending
this

(to McCullough)
I want Rick drafting something asap
Everything’s fine -- everything is okay
Close the door on this now

CAVIC
Security room come in --

HEINKIN
What’s the matter

CAVIC
I’m not getting through
(trying again)
Come in Security --

MCCULLOUGH
Alright we’re leaving right now

CAVIC
Until we confirm with Master Command I
can’t recommend that course of action --

HEINKIN
Jesus

ON ASHTON
as he reaches for the phone he dials

ASHTON
(into the phone)
It’s the President Is my wife there
(beat to McCullough)
We have to be better than this Phil

As he waits for his wife to pick up HEINKIN and McCULLOUGH
begin speaking on two of the OTHER PHONE LINES

ASHTON (CONTD)
Kay it’s me Yeah it’s okay
(beat)
No I’m fine really--

ALL OF THE SUDDEN THE DOOR COMES UNHINGED -- the entire panel
is launched across the room Ashton turns in shock as smoke
coils into the room

CAVIC
Mr President get down

Suddenly a MAN WITH A GAS MASK enters his guns out in
front He fires pegging CAVIC

Ashton drops toward the floor shielding himself --

-- as the MAN unloads on both HEINKIN then McCULLOUGH
BULLETS SPRAY as

Ashton struggles toward the bedroom SMOKE fills in around

him Before he gets there he’s stopped by the MAN WITH THE
GAS MASK --

MAN WITH THE GAS MASK
Don’t move

ON THE MAN WITH THE GAS MASK

as he aims at Ashton Instead of firing he reaches into his
bag and pulls out a second gas mask --

MAN WITH THE GAS MASK (CONTD)
Put it on

ASHTON
What --

MAN WITH THE GAS MASK
Put it onnow

After Ashton obeys the man grabs his hands and SMACKS hand
cuffs down on his wrists The pain is apparent in his
actions --

Let’s go

poked by the butt of his fire arm Ashton’s thrust
forward out of the room --

INT HOTEL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

As they hurry forward they pass the downed BODIES of the

ON ASHTONrefusing his emotions

Rounding a corner they stand just shy of the elevator
entrances Immediately the MAN rips the mask from Ashton’s
face As he does the ELEVATOR CHIMES The sound jars the
MAN and he turns back his guns aimed straight ahead --

ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS

as they open He’s poised to shoot until he sees VERONICA
enter in front of her is gurney that she wheels forward --

Immediately Veronica raises a drug-doused handkerchief to
ASHTON’S FACE

Ashton’s eyes roll back as they catch him from falling Amid
the haze Ashton can hear voices but the words are
unintelligible as they go to work on Ashton --

-- His shirt is ripped as he’s lowered onto the gurney --

-- His ARM is pricked by the IV --

-- An oxygen mask comes down on his face and his breath is
now audible Ashton can hear the MAN WITH THE GAS MASK head
off Within seconds Ashton’s shoved into the elevator --

sees the vague outline of a WOMAN --

SUDDENLY the doors open --

INT HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

As Ashton’s wheeled out it looks like a bomb has just gone
off A MAN (the MAESTRO) rushes to assist and together they
wheel Ashton forward --

ON A SECRET SERVICE AGENT

who screams into his radio Ashton wants desperately to
speak -- call out for help -- only he can’t manage the words

All around LOCAL POLICE and EMTs help the INJURED as
VERONICA and the MAESTRO push the President outside --

EXT HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

LIGHT GLARES from above as the Maestro and Veronica bring the
President to the back of the Emergency Vehicle

THE BACK AMBULANCE DOORS OPEN
and the gurney wheels fold back as he’s slid in
ON ASHTON

as his eye is drawn to A YOUNG BELL MAN (FELIPE) lying on the
ground His glazed open eyes stare backDEAD It is an
image that haunts Ashton this will be him if he doesn’t do
something Anything

INT EMERGENCY VEHICLE - CONTINUOUS

Just as the doors close a SECOND MAN enters the back with
Ashton Ashton’s hands still tied together and his head
overpowered by the drug He shakes his head struggling to
come to Wake up

suddenly the doors in front open and the MAESTRO and
VERONICA climb in The car’s started SIRENS blare They’re
off

As they continue Ashton rocks himself back and forth
desperate to regain control Finally he draws enough
momentum to hurl himself off the side of the gurney onto the
floor --

MAESTRO (0S)
(from the front seat)
What’d he do

-- Ashton’s arm is still fastened to the IV drip As the
weight of his arm pulls it clear he lies on the floor --

MAN’S VOICE (0S)
he fell off

MAESTRO (0S)
He’s fine Leave him

The car accelerates again and the cross talk picks up around
him

LYING ON THE FLOORAshton braces himself pushing curling

into a seated position He can hear voices but has no idea
what’s being said --

Searching wildly Ashton’s hands find the metal pole from
which the IV drip hangs Discovering it he grips hard
fighting for leverage His expression seals he will not die
quietly

Within the conversation the SECOND MAN grows concerned
There’s clearly a tension here Building building until

Shots are FIRED inside the car --

ON ASHTON -- as he brings both hands up and grabs the pole
Lifting it He can’t wait any longer -- it’s now or never --

ASHTON SWINGS clocking VERONICA in the head She cries out

Stop him

Veronica gets out of her seat moving back toward the
PRESIDENT He fights swinging again and again His vision
still impaired he’s wild as he tries to fend her off
Veronica pulls out her gun aiming at his leg as he blocks as
best he can --

MAESTRO (CONT’D)
-- don’t kill him

She fires into his leg Ashton goes down --

VERONICA SCREAMS -- just then the vehicle turns wildly and
he’s thrown

with blood -- as he drops to the ground The last vestige of
consciousness is gone --

CUT TO

EXT PLAZA MAJOR - CHRYON 15 MINUTES EARLIER

ON THE COUPLEthat Lewicki had filmed earlier Drawing
closer we get a second look at VERONICA Her eyes are
locked on the man across from her Its no wonder that
Lewicki mistook the intensity for desire

however standing before her is JAVIER As he stares
back we get a far different sense of the man Beneath his
steely eyes we sense a darkness a man who has lost his soul
fighting now to restore it

Holding a man’s bracelet in her hands Veronica smiles --

VERONICA
I thought you’d want it for luck

JAVIER
I want to know he’s okay

She looks at him again before agreeing Reaching into her
pocket she retrieves her cell phone handing to him --

VERONICA
(re video footage)
This was taken fifteen minutes ago I
think you’11l find that we’re taking good
care of him

Looking down at the screen Javier sees a clip of his BROTHER
(MIGUEL 16) staring back bound gagged his eyes pleading

Javier glares back at Veronica --

JAVIER
What have you done to him

VERONICA
He’s still in one piece you should be
happy about that

Javier brings his rage inward he’s without options
Veronica moves closer whispering into his ear --

VERONICA (CONTD)
As long as you do what you’re supposed
to your brother will be fine
(putting the bracelet on)
But if you failthis will be the last
thing you have to remember him by

Javier pulls away and she smiles -- sinister

JAVIER
Don’t worry about me

We follow him toward the entrance As he maneuvers the
crowds he passes ANNA with her mother MARIE A fully
fledged ICE CREAM CONE in hand Anna is bumped but the cone
stays together --

MARIE
Anna
(Anna’s not listening)
Anna I’m not going to tell you again
I’1l take it away from you --

NEARING THE ENTRANCEJavier spots ENRIQUE at the security
check point Their eyes connect Enrique’s look seems dark
potentially threatening -- further confirmation that he can
trust none of these people

EXT OUTSIDE THE PLAZA - CONTINUOUS
Javier slips out checking his watch as he goes he’s late

ROUNDING A CORNERHe picks up the pace trying to catch up
for lost time As he walks he fishes an ear piece from his
pocket Almost immediately he picks up a conversation in
midstream Leading is THE MAESTRO the brains behind their
operation --

MAESTRO (V0)
stick with the protestors We never
see this
(ironic)
No one hates the Americans

The commentary hardly affects Javier He hurries out into
the street -- Beat

JAVIER
Go ahead

MAESTRO (V0)
Where were you

JAVIER
I’m on my way

MAESTRO (V0)
“The slightest mistake could screw us all

up

While its unclear as to what this refers we hear laughter on
the other end possibly Maestro possibly someone else --

MAESTRO (CONTD)
Your brother spoke very highly of your
special forces training

Javier can’t stomach listening any longerhe just wants to
do what is required and go

MAESTRO (CONT’D)

Javier walks toward the entranceas he crosses the street

we note that half the street is barricaded off As he passes
through the barricade FELIPE (the same YOUNG BELL MAN we saw
at the end of Ashton’s story) approachesoffering his hand

FELIPE
Good afternoon sir

Javier barely nods as he shakes his hand While we didn’t
see the exchange in Javier’s hand he now holds a small
credit-card sized envelope (which Felipe slipped to him) as
he heads inside

INT POSH HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

As JAVIER enters he takes note of the SECRET SERVICE both
inside and out He makes his way toward the elevator
opening the envelope Casually looking down he retrieves a
card key --

IN THE ELEVATOR LOBBYJavier presses the button looking
over at a nearby AGENT who appears to be sizing him up
Maintaining his composure Javier turns away refusing to
give the agent a reason to approach

The elevator doors open and Javier enters He presses “5”
and waits as the doors close Just prior to closing a hand
stops the doors An OLDER WOMAN enters flustered She
presses “3” and the doors close As she turns to face front
Javier checks his watch time is not on his side

INT ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
Silence All eyes are on the lights as they climb 12
In his ear JAVIER hears the MAYOR’S SPEECH

DE SOTO (V0)
this is a wondrous day Today we
make history

DING Third floor The doors open and she exits He steps
forward it’s time to move --

Just as the elevator begins to move again JAVIER pulls the
STOP button The carriage holds and he reaches up to the
emergency panel pushing it open and retrieving a bag hidden
above Bringing it down he pushes the STOP button back and
the elevator continues to climb

INT FIFTH FLOOR - HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

Leaving the elevator Javier moves with purpose down the
hall Listening to DE SOTO’S speech

As he walks down the hall he nods to a HOUSEKEEPING WOMAN --
paying close attention as she steps back into one of the
rooms

Further down he stops at ROOM 514 --

Checking back the hall’s clear Setting down his bag he
reaches in retrieving one of his guns --

DE SOTO (V0)
We must come together on this day in
this renown place to band together for
peace

Just then the door across the hall opens and Javier shuts
his bagas a FAMILY OF ASIAN TOURISTS enter Pre-occupied
with their kids the parents hardly notice Javier He
strains to smile at the young BOY who seems taken with
him

His hand still in the bag still holding the weapon Javier
waitsunsure of what to doas the BOY stares at this
ominous figure

the parents call out to the boy Javier looks down at
him go --

DE SOTO (CONTD)
Therefore I offer you my City my heart
and my hope

-- finally the father grabs his son’s hand leading him
offAPPLAUSE --

Javier exhales as they exit Removing two firearms
silencers attached to each Javier turns toward the door --

In his ear he hears BANG the first shot in the Plaza is
fired -- SCREAMS CRIES --

-- Javier slides the key card halfway in and waits --
-- BANG a second shot --
Javier releases the safeties ready --

TAYLOR

transfixed by a series of SECURITY MONITORS (which include
images of the Plaza) RADIO MONITORS and all of the HOTEL’S

JAVIER FIRES The SHOTS are silent as the FIRST and then the
SECOND AGENT-TECHNICIAN goes down

The THIRD reaches for his firearm but he’s too late --
Javier beat him to the punch

BARNES (V0)
Start clearing a path so we can get him
out of here

Javier lowers the volume as he fires additional kill shots
into each hurrying to the computer

JAVIER
(into his mic)

ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN

Javier reads the frequency bandwidth marked “HOTEL DETAIL”
As he leans in he yanks two of the transmitters from the set
up thereby disconnecting them from the network --

Entering he climbs one flight then another While he
climbs he throws a belt with the requisite charges and
cannisters over his shoulder and fixes a gas mask to the top
of his head (not yet obscuring his face) --

He stops as he draws near to the seventh floor Catching his
breath he checks in on Barnes’ conversation --

BARNES (V0)
--repeat a twenty on Potus over

-- turning down the volume he looks at the bracelet around
his wrist The emotion tugs at him in ways he cannot express--

All of the SUDDEN the ground shakes He can hear SCREAMS
CRIES as the car bomb explodes downstairs

moving to a window Javier looks down to see THE BLACK
SMOKE that shades the aftermath the scattering of PEOPLE
rubble and debris --

-- Javier steps away from the window refusing to deal with

his emotions In the background he hears over the Secret
Service radio--

MAESTRO (V0)
Agents down Repeat agents down -- we
have a situation at the front requiring
immediate back up now

-- heading up to the landing above Javier ducks out of sight
as AGENTS enter the stairwell from the seventh floor and
below hurrying down toward the ground level --

Once they’ve gone Javier breathes deep this is it He
moves back toward the door and opens it --

On the other side only one AGENT is left to guard the
stairwell Immediately Javier fires taking out the agent --

INT HOTEL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Javier enters gun out in front -- his movement and accuracy
a testament to his training

Nearing the elevators he locks in on a SECOND AGENT and
without a moment’s hesitation he fires again -- nailing him

Javier continues around a corner The REMAINING AGENT on the
floor turns and Javier strikes before the Man even has a
chance

AT THE PRESIDENT’S DOOR --

Javier mounts an explosive He steps back lowering the gas
mask onto his face --

He’s forced to consider the destruction he has wrought --

as he leads the President

ROUNDING A CORNER

they stand just shy of the elevators Arriving he looks
around once more before stopping the President -- ripping
the mask from his face Javier looks back at Ashton for the
first time acknowledging what he’s done

Turning away he notices blood beneath him Following it’s
path back up he suddenly realizes he’s been shot

His chest has reddened around the entry wound Looking at it
now Javier’s expression drops It looks bad --

Just then the ELEVATOR CHIMES The sound jars Javier and
he turns his guns aimed straight ahead --

ON THE ELEVATOR

as the doors open Veronica enters and immediately raises a
handkerchief to ASHTON’S FACE Ashton’s eyes roll back

As she lowers Ashton onto the gurney she begins ripping his
shirt away --

-- Javier looks down at his own injury appraising his
options Beat --

JAVIER

Javier aims his gun at the President -- she stops --
JAVIER

doesn’t flinch She doesn’t so much as blink --

Javier cocks the gun setting his shot

Taylor looks over at Javier what the fuck’s your problem
Pressing the gas pedal again he accelerates further

Javier looks around itching Still not fast enough He has
to get there He has to move

Taylor watches him out of the corner of his eye as they
continue down the side streets and through the alleys --

Getting back onto a main road Javier looks down at his
injury The bleeding hasn’t stopped --

-- Taylor watches --

TAYLOR
It’s bad

But Javier refuses the conversation shaking his head --

JAVIER
It doesn’t matter

-- Just then they HEAR a CRASH in the background Looking
back there’s a DAMAGED CAR behind them Taylor looks again

TAYLOR

Javier reads Taylor’s face as he’s recognized Barnes in the
car behind them ---

TAYLOR (CONTD)

We’ve got company -- it’s Barnes

Javier’s expression drops --

Seeing the police car Enrique hangs up A smile broadcast
across his face However Javier’s expression hardens his
brother’s not there

As they stop Javier opens the car door stepping out they
set him up --

ENRIQUE
As planned no

aS Enrique reaches for something behind him Javier senses
danger and beats him to the draw --

JAVIER

gun out of Enrique’s reach before picking it up --

As Javier prepares to finish Enrique off he hears SHOTS
fired from behind He turns to see BARNES running down the
hill toward him --

-- as he runs back to the car Taylor accelerates --

JAVIER
Wait

-- Javier’s exposed running after the car as Barnes fires
again -- pegging him --

-- And Taylor fires back finishing Javier --
All at once his hand slips and Javier falls to the ground

SHOTS RING OUT all around him ONE AFTER THE OTHERGLASS

McCullough show Ashton however we’re less focused on the
whole as much as on words like “assassinate” and “President”
it is clear that this originated here with Suarez
