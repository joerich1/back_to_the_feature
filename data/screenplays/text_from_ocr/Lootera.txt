EXT PAKHIS COTTAGE -- DAY
An almost barren tree Not many leaves left
Snow all around and a light snow falls as well
Watching this tree from inside a cottage is PAKHI Shes
in her early twenties and pretty but her eyes make her

look much older

The wind picks up and a leaf breaks off the tree It
starts to float towards the ground

Pakhi watches the falling leaf all the way till it hits
the snow-covered ground

Overlap the soft sound of drums and woman ululating
Slowly a title fades in on screen

BASED ON OHENRYS THE LAST LEAF
The title fades out The leaf disappears into the snow
The drums get louder
INT HAVELI -- NIGHT
ON a light bulb unlit On this visual a title

MANIKPUR BENGAL 1953

Behind the bulb is the courtyard of a grand haveli
Durga pooja in progress

Woman ululate and men play the drums A decorated statue
of Durga looms over everyone

Standing amongst many people in front of the statue
dressed in finery is Pakhi the same age but looking
years younger

Next to her stands a very dignified middle aged man
SOUMITRA ROYCHOWDHURY the Zamindar of the haveli

The drums beat on
INT HAVELI -- NIGHT

On a makeshift stage in the centre of the courtyard a
jatra is being performed

Loud actors appear from the middle of the crowd walking
dramatically on stage The audience claps whistles and
cheers

Pakhi sits in the crowd with DEVYANI her friend Like
everyone else they have wide smiles on their faces
fascinated by the play
Lootera Shooting Draft vl Pg 2

She looks across the stage and sees the Zamindar sitting
with his estate manager MAJUMDAR Theyre in deep
conversation

MAJUMDAR
Thodi savdhaani baratne mein aap
hi ka faayda hai kanoon kabhi
bhi lagoo ho sakta hai

ZAMINDAR
Apni viraasat hum nahin bechenge
Majumdar

MAJUMDAR

Nahin bechna hai to trust bana
leejiye uss mein bhi waqt lagta
hai Baki sab zamindar babu log
bhi yahi kar rahe hain

The Zamindar ignores him

Another loud actor enters the stage dramatically
delivering a line Pakhi and Devyani laugh aloud

Pakhis laugh turns into a bout of coughing soft at first
but gradually becoming more persistent

Devyani doesnt notice at first but then she does
The Zamindar also notices
INT HAVELI -- NIGHT

The Zamindar and Devyani hurriedly help Pakhi through a
corridor

Shes breathing with a lot of difficulty

She looks at him and smiles again
ZAMINDAR
Maine tumhe kabhi bheel raja ki

kahani sunayi hai

Pakhi shakes her head

ZAMINDAR
Bahut pahle bheelon ka ek raja
hota tha bahut taakatvar koi

usse maar nahin sakta tha Sab
darrte the usse sainkdon baar
angrezon ne inke jungalon mein
dhava bola usse hazaaron teer
maare talwaar se kaata lekin vah
marre hi na phir unko pata chala
ki iss bheel raja ne apni jaan ek
tote mein rakh chhodi hai ab
lakhon tote jungle mein kaise
dhoonde iski jaan kiss tote mein
hai To unhone ek jasoos bheja
Ek sundar sa jasoos bheel uske
pyaar mein padh gaya aur shaadi
kar liek din uss jasoos ne bhaanp
liya ki kiss tote mein bheel raja
ne apni jaan daal rakhi hai
phir aav dekha na taav yoon pakda
tote ko aur

He starts walking towards the gate

INT PAKHIS COTTAGE -- MORNING

Pakhi hears the tinkling of the gate bell
She closes her eyes

SONG 3 begins

EXT FOREST LANE -- MORNING

Varun walks through the forest path now totally covered
with snow

The song echoes the thoughts in his head
He holds the wound at his side Grimaces as he walks

He walks on troubled thinking and comes to a group of
cottages all abandoned Everyone has left for the winter

In the distance stands a man looking at his watch Its
Nandan or the man we know as Biswajeet Roy

INT PAKHIS COTTAGE -- MORNING
Pakhi looks at the tree
We realise that this is the very first visual of the film

The leaf breaks off the tree and floats to the ground
Pakhi watches it all the way

As it hits the ground

After a few more steps he stops in the middle of the

back

The SONG reaches a crescendo and ends as

Lootera Shooting Draft vl Pg 96
He walks around the cottage till he sees a pile of
firewood Holding the axe kept next to the pile he lifts
it and then puts it down groaning in pain and holding
his side
Taking a few deep breaths he grabs the handle of the
axe and with a massive effort and a roar smashes the
axe down on the wood

it near the fireplace and comes to Pakhi again

Varun walks towards her She puts a hand out to stop
him and looks at him through huge wheezing breaths
defiant
He looks at her getting angry while her breathing gets
worse then starts rummaging through the room for her
medicine

He opens a drawer and finds the syringe He loads it and
comes towards her She tries to fight him off

He grabs her arms but she still struggles breathing
heavily all the time

Finally grabbing both her arms in one hand he gives her
the shot in the arm and holds her while her breathing
comes back to normal

She shakes him off and slumps in bed

He sits on the floor against a wall holding his injured
side

They look at each other she with hatred he with anger

The phone begins ringing but neither of them make any
move to answer it

He smiles

The first light of morning breaks through the frosted
window

Slowly Varun disengages his hand from her grip She
sleeps on like a baby

He reaches into his pocket and takes out the photograph
of them from the temple site and places it on her desk

Then he walks out of the room watching her all the time

At the door he takes one last look and finally steps
out

EXT PAKHIS COTTAGE -- MORNING

Varun huddles under his jacket and steps out on the porch
He looks at the tree

His POV Completely bare The last leaf has fallen

He smiles to himself and reaches into his jacket pocket
He takes out a painted leaf

SONG 4 begins

INTERCUT with the police marshalling their forces for the
final showdown

Lootera Shooting Draft vl Pg 108

Varun walks around the house and from behind the pile of
wood he removes a wooden ladder

He carries it towards the tree
Snow begins to fall harder

Varun places the ladder against the tree trunk and slowly
climbs up the tree till he reaches a branch

He takes the painted leaf and some string
We see other older pieces of string on the tree

Varun starts to tie the painted leaf around the branch of
the tree

The snow falls harder the wind gets stronger

The leaf flutters and flies off Varun reaches his hand
out and grabs the leaf The ladder falls away He hangs
onto the brach with one hand slamming into the tree trunk
He wants to shout out in pain but cant Blood falls on
the snow

The police gather at the end of the lane led by KN Singh

With a mighty pull Varun climbs onto the trunk of the
tree and reaches further onto the branch

He reaches further onto the branch The wood digs into
his side He grimaces in pain but doesnt stop Blood
seeps all the way out to his jacket

He ties the leaf around the branch with his last bit of
strength then lets go

He falls to the ground hitting the snow injuring himself
even more

The wind swirls the snow falls But the leaf hangs on
Varun gets up looks at the tree then notices a very weak
and watery sun on the horizon the first time weve seen
it in a while

He smiles and starts walking out of the gate

He walks on the forest path bent over in pain

He looks up and sees the police at the end of the lane
guns pointing towards him

He keeps walking looking them in the eye
Then takes out the gun he has holds it in his hand
KN Singh taps a policeman on the shoulder He fires

Varun takes a bullet in the chest Slumps to his knees
His breath comes out in spurts frosted
