Maniac 1 Meirschultz laboratory--
cabinet in background Oper-
ating table in semi-foreground
Table containing apparatus--—
some strange-looking paraphana-
lia which might remind one of
vivisectionist--overhead light
on table--rest of room dim and
eerie-looking Two practical
hypodermics

2 Dr Meirschultz is working on
table testing hypodermics with
back to audience (side view) and
doing business with instruments

He holds hypo to light and ad-
dresses his assistant

MEIRSCHULTZ
Tonight my dear Maxwell I
am ready to try my experi-
ment on a human

Maxwell is a bit alarmed

MAXWELL
Yes

MEIRSCHULTZ
At the morgue there is a
lethal gas suicide--an ideal
specimen

Maxwell is surprised runs
hand thru his hair

MAXWELL
Have you made arrangements

We see Meirschultz face for the
first time--rather typical half-
mad scientist--mussed gray
hair--very penetrating eyes--

beard

3 Shows his eyes as
he says prying
eyes

MEIRSCHULTZ
(very sharp) No You know I
do not work under prying

Very contemptuous

Maxwell is excited at the
queer look in Meirschultz
eye

Meirschultz drums on table

Craftily

Seeing Maxwell succumbing

Max is agitated and
seems afraid of the doctor

Max is excited

Notices Satan

CUT to Satan gazing at him

eyes

You will find a way for me to
work without detection It is
your chance to show your
gratitude for my generosity
and protection

MAXWELL
I will never forget what you
have done for me and will do
anything to help you--but the
morgue--dead people--sup-
pose we should be caught

MEIRSCHULTZ
How many times have you
told me of your imperson-
ations--that you never had a
chance

Maybe your art will serve you
after all You have seen the
coroner Why not impersonate
him--Thats it

Impersonate him The time
has come when you can repay
me for what I have done

MAXWELL
Its horrible I tell you
Working on the dead trying to
bring back life

Its not natural-- you

with your weird ideas Havent
I stayed here and nursed dying
dogs--and--

--even that miserable cat
And for what--for a measly
roof and food Because you
took me in when I was down
and out

The doctor glares at Maxwell
who seems to cringe under the
spell of the doctors eyes
MEIRSCHULTZ
Once a ham always a ham

You an actor And dont for-

get my dear Maxwell the

police will be glad to find you

Max is very contrite--smiles
wanly Clears his throat

MAXWELL
Hm--I did not mean I
wouldnt--
Meirschultz is satisfied--
but half sarcastically--
MEIRSCHULTZ

Of course not In time you
may be a great man

FADE OUT

FADE IN the morgue--very
dark Several sheeted tables
with supposed corpses under-
neath sheets

One in foreground is that of

a frail beautiful girl Meirschultz
has a case and Max is looking down
in guise of coroner--very dignified
--looks entirely different than
earlier scene Has extreme at-
mosphere of confidence about him

CUT to cat pouncing on rat
and eating it

TWO SHOT--Meirschultz
hands his case to Maxwell--
whispers
MEIRSCHULTZ
This is the one--here
Maxwell papers in hand
reads--
MAXWELL
File No 26941--Maria
Altura--24--suicide--carbon
monoxide gas--not claimed

He shudders involuntarily
as he watches--looks about him

Meirschultz opens case--
takes out hypos--looks at them
--gets air bubble out--gives one

from each into neck of girl

He then starts a series of
manipulations--massages
abdomen in region of heart--
raises arms--works arms

Maxwell watches then notices

that girl is rather good-looking

--starts working with arms

Meirschultz puts stethoscope
to heart--works more rapidly
He is very tense--and excited
Use every effort to build up
tenseness

Finally a faint sigh from the

girl--then

CU of slight drool from the
mouth This is all to let the
audience know she is faintly
alive

Max is astounded at the signs

of life He seems pretty awestruck

He then looks at the girl
This look decides him to
brazen it out

Meirschultz continues

TWO EMBALMERS are working
on a body and notice Meir-
schultz and Maxwell working
on Maria

MEIRSCHULTZ
Perfect--we will have to work
fast

MEIRSCHULTZ
I must get her out of here--
she must have oxygen

Unlock the side door Then
get the cart--but watch out
for the guard Get him out

of the way and well take her
out

1ST EMBALMER
By gosh them stiffs are get-
tin heavier and more of em
every day They even got the
coroner working overtime

2ND EMBALMER
Yeah between the gangsters
and the autos we wont need
another war to carry off the
population

1ST EMBALMER
You didnt even mention the
suicides Did you notice the
beaut that came in today

2ND EMBALMER
Did I

1ST EMBALMER
Thats the one thats got the
coroner doing nightwork

2ND EMBALMER
What--special autopsy

1ST EMBALMER
Guess so Must be I wonder
who that old Santa Claus is
20 Meirschultz laboratory
Max and Meirschultz come
thru door of room off lab
where they have left Maria
Meirschultz looks thought-
ful but agitated
MEIRSCHULTZ
With twenty-four hours com-
plete rest she will recover
Maxwell thoughtful seems
a bit awestruck
MAXWELL
Think of it--life back ina
body that sought oblivion Its
uncanny--the possibilities
terrify me
Meirschultz is excited by
Maxwells speech
MEIRSCHULTZ
Not a word of this out This is
only a step Cases like this
have an element of doubt I
want a victim with a shattered
heart Yes a heart--that can
be replaced by this beating
thing I have forced life back
into Now for my supreme
accomplishment Maxwell you
will get me such a victim
21 CUT TO CU heart beating
in bottle
22 TWO SHOT

MAXWELL

Meirschultz grows more
excited

Maxwell at door He is
alarmed at the doctors
eyes and excitement and
decides to be on his way

CU Max at door

Thinks out loud

LS Exterior Robinsons
mortuary on Washington
Street Just a large brown
house with sign Shoot
down to basement window

A basement window--
Maxwell opens it and
climbs in very stealthily

Interior basement mortuary
Complete darkness except
beam from small window
shining on hazy outline of
table with stiff on it

CU Max tiptoing to table
his figure rather crouched
and looking very fearful

CU Maxwells head--
glances around as if he
fears a presence

CUT to cat fight outside--
one cat runs and other follows

They jump thru basement window

They scoot across floor under
Maxwells legs--frightening
him so he knocks over body
with frightful clatter and he

Not from the morgue Theyll
get suspicious

MEIRSCHULTZ
I dont care where you get it
From the morgue the street--
the undertaker But get one
(whispers) The end will just-
ify the means

MAXWELL
The undertaker around the
corner That gangster shot
today Just the thing

dashes out of the basement

Street from mortuary to
Meirschultz--Maxwell is
running as if pursued

Meirschultz lab--Maxwell
enters excitedly His expres-
sion is one of fear and terror

Impatiently
MEIRSCHULTZ
Where is it
Very breathless and excited
MAXWELL
(gasps) I--couldnt get--it--

CU face of Meirschultz--he
is very angry and glares at
Maxwell contemptuously
MEIRSCHULTZ
Coward-—-

Then Meirschultz cools off
and paces up and down with
Maxwell watching as if not
knowing what might happen

Suddenly Meirschultz stops

in front of Maxwell
You fool You have failed me
in the greatest moment of my
life

Then Meirschultz goes on

walking Maxwell still watches

fascinated (build up)

CU Meirschultz hands taking

gun from drawer as we hear

his voice
I have it You have seen my
powers You have worked
with me You have faith in
me

TWO SHOT--Meirschultz

hands gun to Maxwell
Take this--take your life I
will give it back to you You
know I can

Meirschultz is exultant
My beating heart shall live
in your body--think of it--

Gleam appears in
his eye--CU
Live
Maxwell thinks the doctor
is mad--takes gun auto-
matically

Turns around and looks at
it then whisks around facing
the doctor gun pointed

CU hand--fingers pulling
trigger

TWO SHOT--Meirschultz falls

to floor Maxwell drops gun

goes over to doctor looks him
over realizes the doctor is dead

CU Maxwell--whispers on

knees beside body

Slowly the realization dawns
on him his remorse is turned
to fear and terror

Questioning

Decisive

Conclusive

(shots)

MAXWELL
Murder Ugh

Murderer--and of my bene-
factor--horrible--how could
I

(What will I do I must bring
him back But can I You
should live--you have so

much to give the world But
has he Why should the
unconscious peace of the dead
be disturbed

Isnt the spark that moves
the maggot the self-same
spark that moves the man
Preserving that spark in
the individual is not
important What we do with
the spark while we have it
is important

In Meirschultz the spark

is gone In Maxwell it lives
Still Meirschultz was great
Maxwell was nobody Meirschultz
could bring life back Why
couldnt I

Buckley saw that body--if he
tells the police--no they
wouldnt believe him Well
they might--they would

search this place--they--
mustnt--find him dead I

must bring him back Ill find
that formula and use the beat-
ing heart

Maxwell goes thru
letters and papers
before making
dash for liberty
Among them he
finds

INSERT

By the use of XDSQ formula

in injection into spine violent
superadrenal criminals can be
made completely docile

Maxwell
MAXWELL
The formula for restoring life
must be here Nothing to
bring him back But--this
may come in handy

Id better hide him

Doorbell rings and Maxwell
decides to answer it to avert
suspicion He shoves the

body into Marias room

The above formula paper
drops on floor

Doctors waiting room Max-
well opens door A woman is
standing there rather excited

MRS BUCKLEY

MAXWELL
He isnt here

She thinks the doctor is just
busy working and will see
her if it is important enough

MRS BUCKLEY
Thats terrible Its so very
urgent Will you tell him that
Mr Buckley is having posi-
tively alarming hallucinations
Why he thinks hes the orang-

JONES
Oh then you were speaking
with the coroner--

MIKE
No--He was a-talkin to an old
fella looked like Santa Claus--
like I said to Jake--
suddenly--

Half to himself--

Jones thinks of
Meirschultz but
does not commit
himself

Jones has been
thinking and turns
to the coroner

Belittles this
suspicion as of
no consequence

Jones rises

Ushering them out

Anyway he had a beard And
busy hair n n eyes kinda
wild

It musta been two other
fellas

JONES
Could you identify the man if
you saw him again

MIKE
I wouldnt swear to anything
now--since I was so sure it
was the coroner

JONES
Mikes description sounds like
your friend Meirschultz Have
you seen the doctor lately

CORONER
Whuh Dr Meirschultz is a
great research scientist Why
he has formulated some ama-
zing methods for preserving
gland extracts in their most
potent state Hes no body

JONES
Well doctors and scientists

their minds Anyway Ill look
into it

CORONER
Go easy Jones I wouldnt

rass you

(to Buckley)
You are willing of course to

you undergo this operation at

Buckley is angry

Soothingly but relieved

help him Well try that first

MAXWELL (to himself
Water--thatll do him no
harm and Ill be rid of them

Much the dutiful
wife--put on

Slow questioning

A little exasper-
ated at Jones
slowness Very sweet

Very explanatory
--her sweetest
manner

Fully for their effect

She is scared stiff Wants
to shield Meirschultz but
wants to save herself

from any complicity

JONES
Your husband seems to be
harassed about something
Are you aware of it

MRS BUCKLEY
Oh indeed I am very anx-
ious to have him cured Dr
Meirschultz has been hand-
ling the case

JONES
So I understand Has the
doctor treated him for--

MRS BUCKLEY
Pressure on his brain It can
be easily removed and all
James worries will be over
Oh I will be so happy

JONES
Do you realize your husband
is in a dangerous condition
Has Dr Meirschultz tried any
new theories on him

MRS BUCKLEY
Oh no Not on my husband
He has a theory about glands
as stimulants Why he has
brought dead animals back to
life He has performed some
amazing experiments

JONES
Mrs Buckley do you realize
that you are shielding a
murderer--
Takes it when she says
Dr Meirschultz He
watches carefully as he
says the following

She tells this
fable carefully careless

Very careful questioning

Trying to save
Buckley to get
him out

Ushers Mrs
Buckley out

MRS BUCKLEY
Why--er--what do you
mean by that--why Dr
Meirschultz--

JONES
No not Meirschultz Your
husband had a dying woman
in his arms when found

MRS BUCKLEY
Oh surely the doctor can
explain that My husband is
innocent You ask the doctor

JONES
Tell me exactly what hap-
pened when your husband
left Dr Meirschultz

MRS BUCKLEY

He didnt want to sign the
necessary papers to enter a
hospital proper The first
thing I knew he had the most
terrible spell he has ever
had And before the doctor
could help him--there was so
much confusion I fainted
When I came to he was gone

JONES
Then he did not take the
young lady with him

MRS BUCKLEY
He may have I think I did
see her then You had bet-
ter ask the doctor He can
tell you exactly what she died
of--youll find she wasnt
murdered--

JONES

Ushers her to door
