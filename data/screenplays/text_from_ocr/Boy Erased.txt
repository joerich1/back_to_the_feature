BOY ERASED

Screenplay By

JOEL EDGERTON

Based on the memoir written by Garrard Conley
EXT MEMPHIS SKY CARPARK 2004 - DAY

We hold on a big slice of MEMPHIS BLUE SKY The only sound is
the out of focus American flag whipped by wind in the
distance Soon after we hear but don’t see -

A car pull up on the gravelled asphalt and -

The beeping of the door as it opens From it spills the radio
sounding out the ‘90s country hit -

‘Check Yes or No’ by George Strait

GEORGE STRAIT
I think this is how love goes
Check yes or no

And - a fresh faced young man 18 stands up filling the
frame looking out into the distance

This is JARED EAMONS

He wears an ultra crisp white shirt buttoned to the neck with
no tie He is slim and wears his hair cropped short

The camera moves slightly to take in an out of focus church
cross atop a basic baptist steeple ahead of him All the
while - that distant American flag flapping in the breeze
flanks him from behind

Asecond door opens 0S spilling out that music again -

GEORGE STRAIT (CONTD)
Now were grown up and shes my
wife Still like two kids and stars
in our eyes

- and now -

Jared’s mother NANCY steps into frame She is made up to the
nines bottle blonde voluminous hair hoop earrings and thick
mascara Underneath her heavy make-up we can see concern

She slides on Jackie O sunglasses and looks out toward the
steeple as Jared turns toward the flag They both seem lost
Nancy hides her concern behind the shades tries a bright
smile and out comes her chirpy southern voice -

NANCY
Are you ready honey

Jared looks away for a beat then turns with a convincing
smile and starts walking They leave frame
INT LIA FOYER - CONTINUOUS

LIA is an acronym for ‘Love In Action’ -- But we should
not know that yet There is no signage

Grey-blue carpet covers an expansive floor space Stark white
walls with no hangings or decorations Some empty basic
chairs lining one section of wall Heavy doors lead off to
unknown rooms A potted plant in a corner seems an
afterthought

NB For now we should see it as a dry clinical facility
It should feel like a juvenile detention center of some kind

-- Through the glass of the aluminum framed doors we see
Jared and Nancy approach uncertainly - then enter

Nancy’s ensemble is elegant if not a little gaudy and
mismatched a Southern Belle dress and a shoulder padded
coat She wears heels and clutches a white bedazzled purse

Jareds white shirt is tucked into a pair of brand new khakis
with no belt He wears rubber soled black shoes and holds a
book in a blue plastic shopping bag

They look an odd pair A tall ‘Tammy Baker’ mother escorting
her awkward ultra conservative son

MALE VOICE 0OS
I help you What’s your name

Nancy turns taking her sunglasses off

AARON (40s) stands inside a reception booth Stocky with a
severe hair-cut he puts a clipboard on the reception ledge

NANCY
Nancy

AARON
The kid I mean Unless you’re the
one checking in

Jared and Nancy side by side at the reception desk sign the
clipboard document Aaron stands erect with his authority
inside the booth He too wears khakis and a white shirt
along with a blue tie and a name badge He sizes Jared up

AARON (CONTD)
Let’s get you checked in properly
Jared Wanna say your good-byes

He comes out from the door of his reception booth
NANCY
Can I see the place

AARON
Afraid you won’t be allowed beyond
the reception area Missus Eamons
You can pick him up at five PM

On Nancy uncertain --

JARED
It’s okay mom

NANCY
Call me if you need anything I’1l
be at the hotel and on my cell ph--

AARON
Well be holding his cell-phone If
there are any emergencies we will
contact you Otherwise five PM

Aaron punches a code into the door and the door mechanism
releases with a mechanical buzz

Jared and Aaron pass through the secure door to a hallway
leaving Nancy waving nervously goodbye

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Jared walks ahead as Aaron follows him When Jared turns the
blank expression on Aaron’s face troubles him a little

AARON
Door on the right

They stop in front of the third door and Aaron knocks Soon -
A tall skinny blonde man (Michael 24) answers the door His
shark grey piercing eyes are almost permanently set ina

judgmental frown giving him a mean-streak air

AARON (CONTD)
Newbie Eamons

INT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Michael picks through Jareds possessions scrutinizing each
thing placed down coins cash gum a plastic hotel key-
card the bag containing the book and his wallet
He starts going through the wallet while throwing the gum in
the trash Jared reacts

Jared holds out his cell phone unsure who to give it to
Aaron takes it from Jared and puts it with the pile

MICHAEL
Do you have any numbers or photos
we need to be concerned about

On Jared Thinks Shakes his head slowly It reads like he is
not convinced Michael’s eyes drill into him

MICHAEL (CONTD)
We will check this daily for any
‘False Imaging’ and call any
numbers we want to at random So
best you be straight with all this

JARED
There is nothing And yeah call
whatever numbers if you need to

Michael now back in the wallet holds up a business card
And flips it a handwritten cell number on the back

MICHAEL
Who will answer if I call this
number

JARED
Umm It is my doctor
(beat)
It’s her off hours number I forgot
it was even there

MICHAEL
Anything else

Aaron starts to pat Jared down He finds something --

JARED
Oh Yeah This It’s

From his back waistband he pulls a moleskin notebook Michael
takes it and flicks through It feels like a personal
intrusion to Jared who leans forward

JARED (CONTD)
It’s just I write stories
sometimes I’m at college studying
and I forgot cause it’s --
MICHAEL
You have to start getting a better
memory Trust is one of the key
words around here No journaling
We’1ll need to read this Again for
any false imaging

(to Aaron)

It’s almost nine -

JARED
Sure Will I get this stuff back

MICHAEL
Most things you get back at the end
each day

JARED
That’s fine It’s just stuff I -

Aaron starts to usher Jared out

MICHAEL OS
Forgetting something else

Hold Jared already feels in trouble Then Michael takes
Jareds LIA handbook from the plastic bag On it we see a
logo an upside down triangle with a red heart in it

MICHAEL
You need the handbook at all times
Good luck

JARED
Thank you

It’s the only warmth Michael has offered thus far Meager
INTEXT LIA HALLWAYS - DAY

Jared is led by Aaron As he turns the corner he looks back
and sees another young person being led to the check in area

- They walk out a door and under an awning toward a larger
building

INT LIA MAIN AUDITORIUM - DAY

Jared wearing a name tag finds a seat and settles into a
semi circle of chairs with TEN OTHERS a half dozen teens and
young people a few in their twenties and thirties and one
guy in his forties Three women Mostly boys They all take
out their handbooks We take in their faces as we hear -

- The rules read out starting with Carl super conservative likely taking time out his retail managerial position
CARL
‘Sobriety No smoking No alcohol

or drugs’

And the CREDITS will appear over -

-- during the rules we will intercut with various historical
religious paintings and other images --

The Last Supper by Dagnan-Bouveret Jesus holds up a wine
And now to Sarah (tomboy-ish teenager - all of 16)

SARAH
‘Off hours All clients to remain
within the ‘Safe Zone areas as
designated’

Les Romains de la Décadence Thomas Couture

Credits continue over -- An aerial shot of Memphis Then -
shots of basic boring diners and hotels

Family Portrait by Gillis van Tilborgh NB The withering
look of the central bored male pilgrim facing the viewer

Now - Cameron Cropped hair All of 17 he is a hulking line-
backer in the making with a baby face He reads nervously

CAMERON
‘Hygiene Men to shave facial hair
and women to remove underarm and
leg hair daily’

Toilette der Esther - Théodore Chassériau depicting an
immoral woman with outstretched arms No hair visible

CREDITS continue as we move to LEE Lee is the SLIM BOY who
peeked at Jared in hall Well Lee is actually gender fluid
Non-Binary Most people in fact would have a hard time
being certain of Lee’s gender Lee’s voice is no guide either
way It is soft and intelligent

LEE
‘Attire Men to wear long sleeves
and pants at all times’

Portrait of Jesus by Del Parson where a blonde Jesus has his
hands outstretched in an almost ‘you dig my robe gesture
LEE 0S
‘Women’s skirts must extend below
the knee and bras are to be worn at
all times’

The Virgin Mary in the Rose Garden - Albert Edelfelt
We see a flash of a brassier catalogue dry but sexual

Now PHILLIP (30s Balding and short The guy from the hallway
when Jared first arrived)

PHILLIP
‘Visitations and phone calls to be
pre-approved by LIA staff’

The Religious imagery continues Credits too
And over to SIMON (40 IT Worker type)

SIMON
‘Confidentiality All matters
discussed in therapy are to remain
private’

The Last Supper Leonardo Da Vinci Close on whisperings
ANDERS 17 is fidgety and freckled

ANDERS
‘Restrooms Members must be
supervised by staff during rest-
room visits’

GARY (20s) Even under the crisp khaki and white uniform we
can still tell he is a ‘Goth’ dyed black hair pale
complexion and black converse He is slight of frame
handsome and super smart

GARY
“Sexual misconduct No viewing of
pornographic material’

His reading carries a thinly veiled cynicism that tells us he
does NOT believe LIA and does NOT want to be here

Jan Breughel and Marshall Paul Rubens The Garden of Eden Then

A flash of male pornography
GARY (CONTD)
‘No masturbation No physical
contact with any members or non
members at any time apart from the
briefest of handshakes’

The Last Judgement by Michelangelo depicting men kissing men
Push in We may keep returning to this image -

TINA 27 - super conservative librarian’s hairstyle Glasses

TINA
‘False Imagery Cell phones will be
checked in and out each day
Without exception’

We see flashes of pornographic images PLUS innocent images of
men in modern society with their arms around each other

As the credits wind up it is Jared’s turn now

JARED
‘Sinful salacious and extraneous
materials All reading material
films and television are off limits
while inside the program’

Hold on Jared --

SYKES 0OS
Very good Let’s leave it there

Jared and the rest of the group respond to the voice Someone
new has entered

Closer on The Last Judgement - Michelangelo

CREDITS END --

INT LIA MAIN AUDITORIUM
Tight on the various faces as they listen to --

SYKES 0OS
‘IT am using sexual sin and
homosexuality to fill a God shaped
void in my life’

GROUP
(repeating)
‘IT am using sexual sin and
homosexuality to fill a God shaped
void in my life’
Jared looks around to see the DOZEN or more people that have
entered and line the back walls Various men and women of all
ages Mostly young A similar cross section to the seated
group

SYKES OS
‘But I am not broken and God
loves me’

They repeat

SYKES 0S (CONTD)
Somebody tell me what this is

And finally Sykes steps into frame A man in his mid-forties
Greying cropped hair Piercing eyes A blue shirt and black
pleated trousers The only one deviating from the dress code
here He holds up a dollar bill

SIMON
A dollar

SYKES 0OS
No matter how much you crumple up a
dollar bill you can never take
away its value Even if you rip it
which would represent our being
severed from Christ you can tape
it back together

Jared following the logic soaking up all wisdom

SYKES
Jesus puts us back together and
even though there is a scar our
value does not change

Behind Sykes is the only signage The same ‘heart’ logo from
the handbook cover

Jared looks across at the androgynous boy Lee Out of
everyone Lee seems the most terrified

SYKES (CONTD)
You are somebody You are worth
something And that’s a fact

The door opens interrupting Sykes and in jogs a young
attractive boy in his late teens Breathless

SYKES (CONTD)
Nine-O-five Jon

JON
Sorry Had to run here Apologies

Jon takes a seat Dressed the same as the rest of the group
his cowboy boots are the only thing that sets him apart

Jared can’t help but steal a look as Jon slouches in his
chair As Sykes continues Jon hurriedly fixes the last
couple of high buttons on his shirt Sweat has rendered
patches of the shirt see-through Jon catches Jared looking
who turns away guiltily

SYKES

Thank you Jon
(beat)

Well I want to welcome all you
brave souls I know the road here
wasn’t easy for many of you but I
promise you a smoother ride now
that you are here Welcome to ‘The
Refuge’ program

All of the men and women lining the walls follow Sykes’s lead
in applauding the NEWCOMERS that are Jared’s group

SYKES (CONT’D)
Okay you guys Get back to your
schedules

And with that all of the men and women lining the walls
start to file out Jared watches them

SYKES (CONT’D)
(to Jareds group)
So we can get down to business

He crumples the dollar bill and throws it to Cameron who
catches it

SYKES (CONTD)
Don’t spend it all at once

Jared feels buoyed by Sykes’s rhetoric and light energy in
the room

SYKES (CONT’D)
This may be the toughest but the
most rewarding twelve days many of
you will ever face
(Jared and four others)
We have only one task Simply to
bring ourselves back to God To
invite Him back in T’understand
how he truly meant to create us
(MORE )

SYKES (CONTD)
Before those pieces got torn away
beat)
‘What sinful things have you done’
And to ask Gods forgiveness
beat)
Discover who made you this way
‘Who led you into sin’
beat)
And get you on the right path to a
life restored
beat)
I tell you we are all about to go
on a wonderful journey together
Who’s ready
smiles)
That was a question

Everyone either raises their hands nods or utters ‘yes’

SYKES (CONT’D)
If you are ready say ‘Amen’

EVERYONE JARED
Amen

SYKES
If you know you’re worth a dollar
say ‘Amen’

Jared feels suddenly good and swept up in the new atmosphere
in the room For the first time we see him smile

SNAP TO BLACK

EVERYONE OS

As the title disappears a more personal silence develops
JARED OS
Please Lord make me pure
INT LIA MAIN AUDITORIUM - MID MORNING
It’s tea break Jared sips tea as he looks around

- Sykes speaks to a fellow staff member

- Sarah sits alone eating cut carrots and celery
- Lee sits doing nothing Totally lost

- Nearby Jon talks with Carl the super conservative
managerial type Then Jon salutes him in a casual military
style During this Jon and Jared catch eyes

Sykes claps his hands together

SYKES
Okay Bring it in

Jared approaches his chair Next to him is the VERY large and
very young linebacker-type CAMERON A gentle giant

The sneakers the calloused hands and the crew cut suggest
he was probably blocking a touchdown rush last Friday night
to the roar of his high school home crowd Now for reasons
that he seemed to be puzzling in his head he had found
himself locked in at LIA The roaring stadium bleachers
now replaced by a prison

Jared and Cameron acknowledge each other He is painfully
shy clutching his LIA handbook wishing it was just his
team’s playbook Something he fully understood

Jared catches eyes again with Jon who gives him a mini
salute

SYKES OS
Who can tell us what a Genogram is

INT LIA MAIN AUDITORIUM - AFTERNOON
On the group Finally Phillip raises his hand

PHILLIP
A Genogram is like a family tree
Only one that shows patterns of
family behavior as well But like
an illustrated one

SYKES
Someone read the handbook Thank
you Phillip

Michael moves through the room with big sheets of butcher
paper and plastic tubs of colored sharpies for each member

SYKES (CONTD)
A Genogram shows hereditary
patterns and behavioral clues in
our families It traces the history
behind our sinful behavior

(beat)
Be as expressive as you will but
write a list or draw these folk in
your family Anyone of influence to
you as you grew up too Blood or
otherwise First sexual partners
even Teachers Coaches

Jared looks across at the other members curious of their
various stories and histories

Sykes goes to a board where Michael is furiously writing up a
list of ‘behaviors’

SYKES (CONT’D)
Then write next to these people
their sins --

All members old and young start to sprawl out on the ground
like children drawing Jon and Sarah already familiar with
the task are writing out family names and drawing etc

SYKES (CONTD)
Michael --

Michael’s sounds out the codes

MICHAEL OS
A Alcoholism P Promiscuity H
for homosexuality D for drugs A
Money sign for Gambling M for
mental illness Big A little b for
abortion G slash C for gang or
crime involvement Big P little o
for pornography

Jared looks to big Cameron as he writes slowly -- Mom

SYKES
Youre forgetting oh ‘Dv’

MICHAEL
Oh sorry Big D little v for
domestic violence

Cameron now adds ‘Dv’ next to his Dad

SYKES
Call them out in your Genogram
Because I can guarantee and you
May not even realize it yet but
one or some of these people are to
blame for why you are here

Jared looks down at his page He has listed - Dad Mom
Grandpa W Grandma W Nan Poppy Uncle Chris Aunt Minny
Now his hand wavers over what to mark any of them as
Sykes’s feet step before Jared’s poster

SYKES OS
Search your mind and you’ll find
something

Sykes crouches down Jared out of fear of coming up blank
writes ‘A’ Next to Uncle Chris

SYKES
You know or you don’t know ‘Uncle
Chris is an alcoholic’

Jared erases the ‘’ He looks at Sykes’s feet thinks and
then writes Chloe ‘P’ - (promiscuous)

PRE-LAP - The roar of a crowd

INT ST MARTIN’S AUDITORIUM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 2003)

Packed bleachers out of focus Then in poetic slow motion we
see a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG CHEERLEADER fly into frame A sequined
red white and blue uniform with a big ‘M’ on the chest She
throws a shape in slow motion beaming a THOUSAND WATT smile

Title card CHLOE

Gravity takes her away again but soon she is back bending
into an even more brilliant and dynamic shape

WAYNE OS
Chloe wants to have sex with you

She lands nowin real time and the sound returns to normal

Jared sits on the bench leaning into his friend Wayne He
didn’t hear Basketball players press in front of them

WAYNE
I said Chloe is down to do it
She’s been asking Mindy and Mindy
has been positive for obvious
reasons So you can thank me

Before Jared can respond - The buzzer rings sounds and the
St Martin’s Colonels basketball team are in a GROUP HUG

Soon friends and family members are among them offering
congratulations

Jareds parents approach We recognize Nancy but his dad we
will now meet MARSHALL He limps over in a mismatched blazer
and pants A sturdy man in his 50s

NANCY
Yay You set up so many points I

INT JARED’S ‘02 FORD MUSTANG - NIGHT ARKANSAS SUMMER

A JAMMED CAR Just the opposite of what his father ordered

Jared and Chloe ride up front In the back are two couples
Wayne and Mindy along with Lance and Cheryl

As they pass parked cars and kids walking we see a LAKE in
the BG KIDS are already stripping down and jumping in

They park and everyone goes to get out Chloe pulls Jared
back for a kiss After a couple of attempts he pulls away

JARED
Come on

EXT LAKE - NIGHT

A sprawl of wet undressing youth all in bathers or
underwear

Jared strips down and heads for his teammates who are already
splashing in the water He passes -

A flat-bed truck that is reversed close to the water’s edge
A couple of guys are trying to set up speakers Meanwhile -

Chloe and the girls undress more carefully hanging clothes
in trees or folding them into neater piles

Then the music BLARES received with a victorious cry Bring
Me to Life - Evanescence Another cheer rings out simply for
the choice of song Through the opening riff -

The girls continue to undress while -
In the lake other kids start to ‘air-drum’ to the song

Jared and his mates tune in too all playing their air
guitars Then as the song shifts gear Wayne splashes Lance
and the others and they start to wrestle and play-fight -

Jared jumps into the fray grappling with Wayne fully
committing to the camaraderie Then - Wayne breaks free

WAYNE
Holy Dude Check it out

And then Jared turns to see -

- what would normally make any teenage boy quiver
immediately Chloe in a white bra and panties semi see-
through when wet She is full breasted and wading barely hip
deep in the water The boys all stare - at the trio of
girls pure teenage fantasies wading in the lake Jared turns
back to the guys

WAYNE (CONTD)
Bro What’s wrong with you Go Go
That’s the trophy
The guys all push Jared toward Chloe It’s a slow approach
WAYNE (CONTD)
You know white is see through when
it’s wet Chloe

A few chuckles from the boys

CHLOE
I heard that laugh before I think
on a documentary about hyenas
that were retarded And their
retarded friends

Jared laughs like a goof at Chloe’s joke

WAYNE
You may as well take it off cause
we can pretty much see it all

CHLOE
Shall I Okay
(she teases)
Oh But I wouldn’t want you guys to
pollute the water with all your

WAYNE
Say it You can’t even say it

CHLOE
Cum

Shock Off Wayne’s expression she turns to the girls

CHLOE (CONTD)
See He just did I bet You guys
actually have hard-ons right now
don’t you

Blank expressions Wayne gives an ‘as if’ response

CHLOE (CONT’D)
Prove it

Long pause Jared certainly doesn’t have a hard-on but
wonders if he should Chloe won’t let up

CHLOE (CONT’D)
Stand up properly All of you

None of them are willing Finally Lance goes up on his tip-
toes We don’t see it but Chloe must be right because Mindy
stifles a laugh and Cheryl turns away with an ‘Ewwww’ Lance
drops back down into the water He doesn’t care

LANCE
Damned if you do Damned if you
don’t

Then - Chloe splashes Jared breaking the tension and they
all start to wrestle thrashing in the water

EXT LAKE-SIDE BEACH BONFIRE - NIGHT

Jared and Wayne by the bonfire Lance and Nick dress close
by Wayne offers sage advice on sex -

JARED
What’s it like

WAYNE
We’ve done it four times now

Jared nods His friend is an expert

WAYNE (CONTD)

It’s pretty awesome dude I have to
say I mean I’m sure it’d be even
better just relaxing on a nice bed
instead of in the corner of a barn
or in some dark closet with an
actual real fear of getting caught
and shot by Mr Riggs But -
Even still it’s a-mazing

(beat)
It’s like being in a place you’ve
been told over and over is bad and
then you get in there and you are
like - ‘how is this bad I wanna be
in here forever’

LANCE
Like White Castle

NICK
Like eating a burger

LANCE NICK (CONTD)
Like shut up You compared sex with a girl
to eating shitty food

Lance punches Nick and Nick returns fire Soon they are up
wrestling each other Wayne and Jared

LANCE OS
Get off me fag Faggot

WAYNE
It’s warm And it gives you this
amazing great feeling

JARED
I bet yeah
(MORE )

JARED (CONTD)

WAYNE

Plus man Listen This whole no
sex before marriage thing would
your dad expect a customer to buy a
car without test-driving it See
You almost have to try it

(good point)
You won’t wanna stop dude
Seriously Try it You’ll see

This lands with Jared The thought that maybe sex with Chloe
could make him snap out of his thoughts aimed at men He
looks across at her on opposite side of the fire She has
finished dressing and wears his hoody

INTEXT JARED’S FORD CHLOE’S FAMILY HOME - NIGHT
Elton Johns - “Sad songs said so much plays as Jared pulls
up to Chloe’s family home Their hair is still wet

CHLOE
Go back behind the tree

JARED
I should get home I -

CHLOE
We are fifteen minutes early

He reverses so a large maple tree blocks the view from the
house to the car She immediately starts to kiss him Jared
engages Then his eyes open looking down --

A hand Chloe’s hand is on his thigh He stops her

CHLOE (CONTD)
What I just wanna touch it
(beat)
On the outside

Jared keeps his hand on hers
CHLOE (CONTD)
If it’s not hard I can make it
hard

JARED
We should wait for that kind of -
20A

CHLOE
I’m not asking you to put it inside
me Jared I just wanna feel it
through your jeans

(MORE)

CHLOE (CONTD)
Wayne and Mindy have gone all the
way and they didn’t get struck by
lightning or put in prison Cheryl
has put at least three in her mouth
that I know of

JARED
Cheryl

CHLOE
I just wanna feel it

JARED
If we start that then it’s gonna
be hard to stop I want to but
shouldn’t we wait until you know -

CHLOE
You asking me to marry you
(beat Silence)
That’s what my parents think should
happen To keep us together through
college

Jared is at a loss for words Then Chloe tries one more time
He stands his ground She sits back defeated and opens the
door

CHLOE (CONT’D)
What is wrong Jared

Jared is left alone aware this is an escalating issue

INT EAMONS FAMILY HOME - JARED’S BEDROOM - DAY

Jared shirtless staring at a screen He types something
quickly and bites his nails and checks the door

Circa 2004 downloads were not so fast so it starts with the
top inch of a man’s face then five seconds later the neck
and bare shoulders A slow motion strip tease

NANCY OS
Jared honey

Jared tries to shut the screen but gets the ‘spinning wheel’
The image is stuck halfway He tries again but the image
downloads one bar further Nancy approaches Thinking quick
he turns the screen to black

NANCY
I’m starting a new painting Which
one do you like best

(MORE)

NANCY (CONTD)

She holds up two images (both of the family) He picks one
She stays there continuing to look at the photos

JARED
Mom I’m getting dressed

On her way out

NANCY
Make sure you pack for Dallas I
think your father wants to go
straight from church tomorrow

Nancy leaves Did she see or not see the glistening muscular
man in the underpants ad He brings the screen up again The
image no longer enjoyable is a just source of guilt

INT EAMONS FAMILY HOME - LATER

Marshall sits at the breakfast table Jared shuffles in
dressed in a similar shirt Jared goes to the fridge

MARSHALL

Well detail that car today
JARED

Dad seriously it’s so awesome
MARSHALL

Are you ready I’1l ride with you --
JARED

Why are we actually going to

Dallas
MARSHALL

The architect has updated the
remodelling plans for the ministry
and we are taking a tour of two
similar churches there

JARED
Do you think I could stay at
Chloe’s when you go instead
(Off Marshall’s look)
It’s okay I can stay at Wayne’s or
I’1l just come I’1l just come

MARSHALL
I’m okay with you staying there if
they are I think it’s a good idea
(MORE)

MARSHALL (CONTD)

INT FIRST NATION BAPTIST MINISTRY - DAY
On Jared flanked by Nancy watches Marshall preach

MARSHALL
Let’s see a show of hands --

Wayne who sits next to Jared palms him something A condom
He winks Jared is mortified

MARSHALL (CONTD)
Who knows they are imperfect

Everyone’s hands go up Jared swaps the condom in his hands
to comply with all the hands firing up in the air

MARSHALL (CONTD)
And those that are

No hands - a polite chuckle from the congregation -

MARSHALL (CONTD)

Well that seems like the perfect
segue to my introduction Jesus
spoke to me the day I saw this man
first speak and said ‘listen to
and learn from this man’ Which I
have done every week in this very
church He has helped me immensely
and given me the strength to start
my own mission at Mountain Home

Jared catches eyes with Chloe -

MARSHALL (CONTD)
He’s about as perfect as any man
can get in this world and in his
true service to the Lord My
mentor Pastor Lynn Marks

He passes the mic to the elder Pastor Marshall then sits in
front of Jared and turns with a smile and a weird high-
fivehandshake Pastor Wilkes climbs the stairs

PASTOR
Everybody stand up On your feet

And such is Pastor Wilkes’ power the congregation stand

INT CHLOE’S FAMILY HOME - NIGHT

Jared sits for dinner with Chloe her parents ERIC and BRANDY

INT STAIRWELL - NIGHT
Jared moves ever so quietly up the stairs But then -

CHRISTOPHER OS
Where you think you’re going

Jared frozen turns to see Christopher Sprung

INT BASEMENT - NIGHT

Jared plays Dynasty Warriors III with Christopher The music
is synthesized and upbeat The character Zhang looks like
an Asian rock prince clad in purple silks wearing a slick
hair topped by a tiara He swings a four pronged sword

CHRISTOPHER
What do you think of him What’s-
his-face Zhang He there with his
girly crown and pony tail in the
purple outfit moving around like a
dancer

JARED
Yeah It’s a bit much

CHRISTOPHER
A bit gay don’t you think

Jared looks at Christopher

CHRISTOPHER (CONT’D)
Don’t you think

They stare at each other Something shared in the look
Dangerous and also tender There is a wisdom to Christopher
for a younger kid The silence broken only by a text message

CHRISTOPHER (CONTD)
You wanna go and fool around with
my sister I ain’t gonna stop you

Hold
26A

INT CHRISTOPHER’S BASEMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jared stares at the ceiling then finally turns to fall
asleep He’s given up the attempted mission

CUT TO

INT LIA MAIN AUDITORIUM - AFTERNOON (PRESENT)

Jared stands back from his Genogram and stretches He making
some notes on his LIA notebook

INT LIA ADMIN OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

Jared is handed a zip-lock bag containing his possessions by
Michael Jared opens his phone just to check it

MICHAEL
Tomorrow at nine

Jared starts to walk toward the exit as Michael moves back
down the bowels of LIA Jared turns holding his Moleskin

JARED
Um Hey You tore out the pages -

MICHAEL
False Imaging

Jared looks at the book with the pages crudely ripped out

JARED
They’re just stories

MICHAEL
Sykes will decide that

EXT LIA - AFTERNOON

Jared comes out quietly fuming holding his bag of items Jon
is on the steps waiting Jared sits a little way off

JON
Whatever they took you’ll probably
get it back Don’t sweat it

Jared tries to let it go

JARED
Were you in the military I saw you
salute I thought --

JON
Oh That No I could do the whole
handshake thing I’m just trying
zero contact what-so-ever

(MORE )
27A

JON (CONTD)
Twenty-three days now So I -
(he salutes)
Salute instead

JON (CONTD)

Jared nods awkwardly

JON (CONT’D)
Sure it don’t feel like it right
now maybe but you’1l love it here
You get all sorts but this group
seems good

JARED
Have you been here before

JON
It’s my second go round in the
Refuge Program I started a couple
days late last time and -
(beat)
I’m actually waiting for a place to
open up in one of the houses

JARED
What houses

JON

Down the back there past the fence
they got a couple houses for the
long-stayers New Hope house for
the men One for the women too

(points)
Those others you saw earlier today
most of them stay there

(beat)
Meanwhile I’m at the Best Western
while I wait for my spot Assuming
youre staying at one of the local
‘safe zone’ hotels with a relative
too

Jared takes this in

JARED
How long will you stay for

JON
That’s not really up to me Sykes
decides - sometimes six months Or
else a year You eighteen

JARED
Just Yeah

JON
Then you can stay at the houses

28A

Off Jared’s look -

JON (CONTD)
Nobody explained that to you This
is just an assessment program The
Refuge To see what to do with you
next

Just then - the doors open and out walks Sarah flanked by
Aaron on one side and an older man possibly a stepfather on
the other Everyone watches as she gets ‘put’ in the car like
an escorted prisoner Jon takes it in

JON (CONTD)
Should’a seen her arrive this
morning She’1ll be fine Like I
said ‘all sorts’ Some are ready
for it Some not

This hangs Is Jared there by choice or by force He catches
eyes with Gary who leans against the fence

JON (CONTD)
Lean into it man It’s the only way
to do it and win S’only way it’s
possible Just lean in

(beat)

And it is possible If you’re on
your heels you’1ll lean too far away
and fall backwards into hell again
No point not leaning in when you
get given the chance

Jared absorbs Jon’s optimism He already has identified him
as someone to look up to

JARED
Yeah No I’m excited to be here

Suddenly Nancy pulls up and leans out the window -

NANCY
Hey How was it Was it fun and
interesting

Jared stands up a little embarrassed She waves to Jon -

NANCY (CONT’D)
Hi I’m the Mom
(no response)
I’1l1 turn around

Nancy starts the turn as Jared gets set to leave -

JARED
You need a ride I think we’re just
near the Best Western

JON
Someone’s on their way to grab me
Thanks though And don’t sweat the
things they took Lean in Think of
the bigger picture

He salutes from his perch and Jared starts off -

Jared passes Cameron who gets into his Dad’s suburban SUV
At a first glimpse CAMERON’S DAD a wealthy man looks like
an ex-football player

JARED
See ya Cameron

Cameron turns sweetly flattered to be acknowledged But his
father turns sharply to assess Jared

INT NANCY’S CAR - AFTERNOON

Nancy’s car pulls onto the highway into the dimming Memphis
sunlight toward the glowing row of cheap hotel lights

Jared winds down the window and puts his arm out dancing in
the breeze

NANCY
Please don’t do that I’ve told you
that makes me nervous What if a
truck comes and

JARED
That is never going to happen

NANCY
It’s happened before It has

He pulls his arm back in and winds the window up

INT HAMPTON INN AND SUITES RESTAURANT - DUSKNIGHT

Jared and his mother eat She keeps looking at him Jared
puts his fork down decisively as if to say ‘what’ --

NANCY
Well I wanna know about your day
(MORE )

NANCY (CONTD)

JARED
We’re not meant to talk about it
outside of group

NANCY
I don’t need gossip You can speak
generally

JARED
I’m going to lean into it And
there are some good people and
yeah I like it
They go back to eating Nancy relieved He seems happy Jared
thinks a beat and finally takes a piece of paper from his
pocket and places it beside Nancy’s plate
JARED (CONTD)
Do we have people in the family who
had issues with any of this stuff
Nancy examines it getting her reading glasses

NANCY
‘Pornography’

The people at the booth behind turn and she lowers her voice
NANCY (CONTD)
‘Drugs’ ‘Gang affiliations’ What

is this

JARED
I need to know for homework

NANCY
Gang affiliations

OMITTED

INT HAMPTON INN AND SUITES HALLWAY - DUSKNIGHT

Jared and his mother walk the long hall to the room

NANCY OS
Why does the family matter Our
family is so normal

As Nancy enters the room Jared clocks Sarah and her
stepfather a little way down the hall

INT HAMPTON INN AND SUITES ROOM - NIGHT

Jared puts his schedule on the wall He takes his LIA
handbook and homework and piles them on the nightstand He
weighs his own books he brought for the stay -- now certainly
‘off limits’ About to place them in the trash he thinks
better of it and piles them over on his mother’s nightstand

Nancy enters from the bathroom and places a piece of paper on
the top of his LIA handbook Jared’s Genogram homework

NANCY
Sleep well Big day tomorrow

As she walks away he examines the paper

NANCY (CONT’D)
I was only with the gang for a year
or so Until I went down for
drugs and got sent to prison

JARED
Ha ha

Jared leans over and switches off the lamp Then after a
pause in the near darkness we hear -

NANCY OS
I put your Uncle Victor down there
We never see him He moved to
Louisiana We always figured he
might have been well he was
very feminine-like you might say

Jared stares at the ceiling the traces of light outlining
his face

SYKES OS
What is a real man
INT LIA MAIN AUDITORIUM - MORNING
CLOSE ON JARED’S GENOGRAM It now has a handful of ‘A’s added
and ‘Dm’ in both grandparents lines And a new BOLD

addition UNCLE VICTOR -- ‘H’ (Homosexuality)

SYKES OS
What defines a ‘real’ man

Close on Cameron’s child-like drawing of his dad Brutish

SYKES 0S (CONT’D)
Perhaps being close to the flames
of hell and finding your way back
forges a great strength --

Jared and the others pin their work to the back wall From
his position near the big open door Jared can see the fence
line outside A big black Chevy pickup parks outside

OMITTED

INT LIA MAIN AUDITORIUM - DAY

Close on the members of the group as they keenly watch the
‘newcomer’

SYKES OS
And if so if this isn’t a real
man I don’t know what is

Sykes is almost too excited to introduce their guest staff
member And we finally see him -

SYKES
Meet Brandon Ellis

There is no mistaking Brandon is a hard man who’s lived a
hard life and walked a hard road That 1 that makes most
self-proclaimed men feel ‘less than’

SYKES (CONT’D)
Over to you Brandon

Sykes tries a tough-guy handshake It is comfortable on
Brandon Not with Sykes

BRANDON
Thanks Sykes Mighty kind of you
and God bless

(beat)

A ‘real man’ to me is a man of God
first and foremost I’m a man of
God no doubt But I wasn’t once
If I was ever listed on my own
son’s Genograms - God forbid I was
and that he were here -

In that comment we see not just Brandon’s thinly veiled
disgust for homosexuality

BRANDON (CONTD)
- But if I was Drugs Violence
Prison time Gang crime Id
have so many letters next to my
name it would look like
qualifications from some
university

(pause for effect)
And I actually believe that to be
true I’m qualified to be here not
maybe because I have ever had the
kinds of thoughts and feelings that
yall are wrestling with Or that
your other guidance counselors have
overcome

There is the disgust again PLUS it dawns on Jared that most

of the staff may be ex-gay He steals a look at Sykes

BRANDON (CONTD)
But I’ve had all sorts of my own
trials that took me so far from the
Lord it is a true miracle that I
am standing here before you But I
am

INT LIA SHORT BUS - DAY

Jared and the gang all ride the short bus Brandon and Sykes
flank the aisles near the front Aaron drives We are not
sure where they are headed Jared turns for a moment and
looks down the aisle - perhaps to see Jon

INT OUTDOOR FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

The whole group are in a line Brandon moves along spreading
the guys’ stances wider and correcting posture while Sykes
and Aaron and the girls sit on the concrete bleaches

BRANDON

Standing Leaning Sitting It’s
all the same idea Triangles are
the strongest shape This

(he shows a wide stance)
Not this

(a narrow one)
Okay hand or hands on hips Go

Brandon claps and each boyman lifts their hands to hips in
their own manner It’s a drill they’re being subjected to

BRANDON (CONT’D)
(to what he sees)
Fingers forward not backwards
Sjust the way it is Elbows out
Not back S’just the way it is
Triangles Triangles

Sykes watches with his hands on his hips Not exactly the
picture of manliness he adjusts his own elbows out a little

BRANDON (CONTD)
Think of the shapes you are making
and ask yourself ‘Is this a
manly shape I am making’ Or ‘is
this a girly or a feminine shape’

On Sarah frowning She is sitting this one out But she’1ll
serve another purpose

BRANDON (CONT’D)
Sarah I want you to arrange these
guys in a line in terms of
masculinity if you will Least to
most

Jared and the others look around wondering where they might
fall on the line Sarah tentatively starts in on the task

BRANDON (CONTD)
Myself and other alcoholics and
addicts put their faith in AA Get
familiar with this phrase -
(beat)
‘Fake it until you make it’

Sarah struggles in deciding who is on what side of the MANLY
evolutionary chain of LIA

SYKES
Do it Sarah Don’t think Just do

Sykes’s authority seems diminished by the mere presence of
Brandon the clear biological ruler here

Jared is moved along by Sarah He is placed somewhere in the
middle next to Gary They share an awkward friendly nod
Sarah has placed Lee at one end and Jon and then Cameron at
the ‘Most’ end Cameron gets the crown

Sarah stands back and Brandon steps forward He walks the
line starting with Lee his face hides nothing in his
confused assessment of Lee As he completes the line -

BRANDON
Perrrr-etty good

Brandon moves to face Cameron who stands at least five
inches taller than him He reads his ‘sticker’ name tag

BRANDON (CONTD)
So You think ‘Cameron’ here wins
(beat)
You think being big and tall and
overeating immediately just puts a
guy at the front of the line

Brandon lets it hang then moves away addressing the group
Cameron relieved to have Brandon out of his personal space

BRANDON (CONTD)
In prison I knew men who could shop
at Gap for Kids by that I mean
little guys who were pound for
pound tougher than any linebacker
Swear to the mighty Lord

(aside)

Now Jesus was a tough dude Don’t
get me started on that

He looks up at Cameron Tries to make eye contact

BRANDON (CONTD)
It’s more than triangles and
posture and genetics

He offers to shake Cameron’s hand to which Cameron offers a
‘limp’ shake Brandon casts it aside with disgust

BRANDON (CONTD)
Firm handshakes Eye contact Not
too much Looking at women at the
right times The wrong times too

Meanwhile he pushes Cameron fourth down the line

BRANDON (CONTD)
No offense son All a process Fake
it Make it

Jon now takes the prize of ‘manliest’ Brandon offers a hand
shake Jon wants to but he’s on his ‘no-touch’ promise
After a tense pause he offers one of his salutes

BRANDON (CONTD)
Military man G’bless son

BRANDON (CONTD)

EXT BASEBALL BATTING CAGE - DAY

Jared and the others line up outside of a batting cage fence
We hear the ball being shot out and the grunt of -

Simon who misses the ball then miserably hits the second

BRANDON
Who you are on the inside can be
affected by the outside Next

Lee look bewildered realizing it’s time to step up to the
plate Simon hands Lee the helmet

BRANDON (CONTD)
Outside in Fake it till you make
it Adapt to survive

Lee enters as Brandon slides another coin into the slot
There is a terrible anticipation and the first ball comes
SHOOTING out Lee startles

BRANDON (CONTD)
And you kids and folk being what
you are afflicted with --

Lee spins disoriented by the second Then the third makes
awful body contact tilting the helmet from Lee

BRANDON (CONTD)
- better learn how to survive
Become the man you are not

Jared sees Brandon smirk amused and unwilling to turn off
the machine Lee is swamped and scared Gary goes in to help

BRANDON (CONTD)
When you are in a prison you would
surprise yourself --

On Jared absorbing all this as we hear -

METALLIC NOISES GUNS in fact Guns being loaded CHKCHK
Magazines being locked CHK Firing bolts being racked

Beside Jareds table is A YOUNG MAN barely 25 his three
KIDS and young wife There is also two men sitting at a
window booth that Jared particularly notices Just then -

Once in Marshall takes a pile of religious pamphlets from
the glove compartment On one he writes a bible reference

Romans 127

MARSHALL
There are two men sitting by the
window I just paid for their
lunch Tell them Id appreciate
them taking a look at this paper
and this verse For their sake

Jared wants to ask why but is unable He knows
40A

MARSHALL (CONTD)
Men committed shameful acts with
other men and received in
themselves the due penalty for
their error

INT CARMEN’S STOP - DAY

Jared walks back into the diner He looks to where the men
enjoy their lunch Jared looks out the window to where his
father’s truck is in clear view watching He moves in their
direction holding the pamphlet behind his back

JARED
You guys travelling

MAN 1
We are on our way to a wedding in
New Orleans

JARED
Oh Cool Um My father my
father just paid for your lunch

The two men look strangely at this kid in hunting gear

JARED
Nothing Just He’s out there -

The two men wave out the window He pockets the flyer

MAN 1
Well Tell him thank you

JARED
Yes Sir Safe travels

MAN 1

INT MARSHALL’S TRUCK - LATER

After a long silence --

JARED
They said to say thank you

The moment hangs Does he know that Jared failed the task

EXT GRAVEL ROADLIA COMPOUND - DAY

Feet hit gravel Jared and the new group run in a somewhat
military formation with Brandon as their commander Aaron
follows them driving the short bus

INT HAMPTON INN AND SUITES - DAY

Jared brushes his teeth - his shirt is off He examines a
bruise on the back of his shoulder a baseball strike But he
enjoys the wound like a new sense of his manhood

Then - he catches himself with one hand on his hip He clamps
down on the tooth brush and stands ala Brandon two hands on
hip hand back legs wide - proudly faking it Soon Nancy
joins and they both brush side by side

INT LIA MAIN AUDITORIUM - DAY

The words “Fake it till you Make it” written on the board
Then - Sykes steps into frame perusing -

The bewildered faces of the group staring back

SYKES OS
Moral Inventory
(beat)
Now the real work starts Catalogue
your sins and ask God’s forgiveness
for your wrongs Sarah --

Sarah hesitates to get out of her chair She finally does and
passes Aaron who is setting a video camera on a tripod His
secondary task here seems to record significant events

CUT TO

Sarah facing the group reading from a handful of papers She
is mid-flow It is painfully awkward hearing her read She is
trying to motor through it as fast as humanly possible

SARAH
-and it was there that I had
sinful thoughts of other girls
(MORE)

SARAH (CONTD)

I would look at other girls in
the changing rooms before gym And
in the showers My biggest sin is
one that I am also thankful for
because it has led me to Love In
Action

(beat)
I had run away from my uncle’s
house and stayed with some girls I
knew whose parents were away And
it was there that for a few days I
finally acted on my homosexual
thoughts

(breathes )
I renounce these sinful thoughts
and actions and I ask God to
forgive me all these things -

Jared watches He knows that he’1l be up there soon
cataloging his own sins

INT LIA MAIN AUDITORIUM - DAY

Sykes sets up the ‘LIE CHAIR’ exercise Two empty chairs
facing each other a role-playing exercise

Sarah takes one of the seats waiting with dread

SYKES OS
Go Sarah There he is in that chair --

CUT TO

We smash right into the exercise Jared watches Sarah be
BERATED by Sykes to engage with an invisible family figure
Sarah grips the side of her chair White knuckles

SYKES
- staring right back at you

He isn’t Opposite her is literally an empty chair

Jared turns to check on Jon who leans forward in his chair
Gary beside him leans back biting his nails

SYKES (CONT’D)
There he is Use your words Spit
them out with purpose Personal
pronouns like I said ‘YOU’ wronged
me ‘YOU’ showed me sin

SYKES (CONTD)

But Sarah keeps thinking Paralyzed

SYKES (CONTD)
Don’t over think it Nobody’s
judging Sarah But God is watching

SARAH
I’m trying

SYKES
He’s watching And He’s waiting

SARAH
I’m trying to find the right words

Sykes unleashes a trial mock tirade on the empty chair
SYKES

‘You wronged me You wronged me
Uncle’ what was his name

SARAH
Joe
SYKES
‘You wronged me Uncle Joe -- You

took me into the care of your home
and locked me up for ---

SARAH

SYKES
‘You wronged me Uncle Joe and Aunt -
(stops himself)
Aaron Bring me that empty chair

Aaron hustles and Sykes puts it next to the other empty
chair Two chairs for two imaginary people Behind him we
hear a laugh He swivels catching Tina with a smirk

SYKES (CONT’D)
You think this is funny Tina You
think the reason y’all are here is
funny Take these exercises

are trying to help you

He clicks his fingers in front of Sarah

SYKES (CONTD)
Yes Yes Let it out

SARAH
Leila wasn’t my aunt She was my
cousin that lived with Uncle Joe

SYKES
(sighs)
Alright Let’s take a break

He checks his watch Aaron turns off the camera

SYKES (CONTD)
Sarah can try again tomorrow Every
day two of you will walk into the
arc like Noah’s animals And get
refuge from damnation This is the
ticket of entry No free rides

He taps the empty chair and meets with Michael who has an
urgent issue Sykes turns concerned

Seven o’clock can you meet me by

Jared nods and moves away conflicted by the encounter
Through the open door Jared sees Sykes with two PARENTS It’s

somewhat heated admonishment by the father Then we see Lee

‘How you came to be at LJA

He checks his watch Almost seven --

INT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Jared walks into the hallway leading to the bathrooms It is
empty apart from the ATM Then the bathroom door opens up and
Sarah peeks through Seeing Jared she marches over covertly
and puts her hand out He hands her his phone and just as
quickly she disappears into the bathroom He waits
Awkwardly That’s when he sees -

Sykes with a woman and kids ages six and four They move
into the restaurant Seemingly an average American family

Jared nervously hides behind the ATM and waits guiltily What
is he doing What if he gets caught

Finally Sarah emerges wiping her eyes She hands Jared the
phone and utters -

SARAH
Don’t you dare tell anyone

Jared watches her sneak away like she was never even there

guy Henry bounds up the stairs toward him Perfect timing

HENRY

Jared accepts the help with an awkward thanks Henry looks in
a drawer as he carries it It is mainly full of books

Everyone stands and Henry does too Jared is a beat behind

of worship Henry offers Jared a hand to stand Jared stands
and watches as Henry euphoric cuffs the young TEEN in front
of him and lets out a ‘whoop’

HENRY

Henry puts his manly arm around Jared who allows himself to
smile and start to enjoy it He relaxes and puts his arm
around Henry too It’s a brotherly embrace that feels safe in
this environment But --

The music turns to something synthesized and ominous

EXT LYON COLLEGE CAMPUS - NIGHT

Jared and Henry on a run jog around trees deflecting cherry
blossom tree branches to cut a smoother line

Later -
47h

At the end of their run they stare at each other as they
stretch and search for oxygen Jared tries a smile But it’s

behind as Jared controls the game and Henry watches sipping
a beer A lone player makes his way through the green and
blue glow of an underground concrete facility Jared steals
a look at Henry’s face glowing in the screen’s light

Henry checks his watch Sips his beer He’s tired

Henry gets up and we hear the sounds of Henry climbing up the

bunk ladder

Jared watches turns down the sound and then goes back to his
game conflicted He’s attracted it’s clear But Henry is
straight and Jared has ZERO experience with ANYONE

JARED OS
Am I in trouble

INT LIA ADMIN OFFICE - DAY (PRESENT)

Tight on Jared’s face as a door opens and shuts OS

JARED
Have I done something wrong

MICHAEL OS
Here he comes now

SYKES OS
Morning Jared
48A

Sykes sits carrying a file His demeanor is supremely casual
and friendly Not the ‘man on show’ he is in the group
sessions The only sound is a ticking clock

SYKES
No reason to be worried Around day
three I just check in with the new
recruits See how they’re getting
along Little private chat

A poster behind Sykes linking AIDS to homosexual deviant
behavior draws Jared’s attention for a moment

SYKES (CONTD)
So how is it going for ya

JARED
It’s good I’m finding it all
helpful yeah

SYKES
How is your Moral Inventory coming
along Are you ready You wanna go
today Dive right in

JARED
Oh I um I’d like to watch a
couple more people do theirs I
think if that’s okay I haven’t
completed everything yet

Sykes pulls out a handful of papers from his file Jareds
journal stories He selects a page and holds it up

SYKES
What is this

JARED
It’s a story

SYKES
It’s a love story about a boy and a
girl Were you thinking about two
boys when you wrote this
(hold)
Is this a true story

JARED
No It’s just a story
(off Sykes)
Will I be able to get them back
They’re assignments for college
SYKES
Yes I noticed your list of books
here A reading list I assume
(holds it up
(MORE)

49A

SYKES (CONTD)

Some of these books -- considering
everything that’s going on for you
I wonder if this is really the
right thing for you to be pursuing
at all Perhaps a year with us is a
better use of your time Something
to think about

This troubles Jared but he nods Sykes reads him his eyes
narrowing a little and then the smile returns -

SYKES (CONTD)

Listen I want you to know I’ve
had conversations with your parents
in the lead up to you being here
and I know a little of your story
somewhat

(smiles )
I know there are discrepancies from
what your parents were told and
what you have said to them And
they are really unsure what to
believe But I know there is a
bigger story Or stories Right
We’re not here based on mere
thoughts alone

(beat)
You know the ones that get the
most out of this are the ones who
are brave The ones who fess up to
what God already sees Jared

His friendly concern has somehow taken on the air of threat
SYKES (CONTD)
You really gotta put it all on the
table here That way we can really

assess what is the best future for
you

INTEXT HALLWAYSYKESS OFFICE - DAY
SLOW MOTION Jared walks out We read his disappointment -
GARY 0OS
Dear heavenly father today I ask

your forgiveness for my sins

Jared takes the corner

GARY OS (CONT’D)
For a year we lived under the cover
of being ‘roommates’ though we
werent using separate rooms

INT LIA MAIN AUDITORIUM - DAY

Gary goes through the process of reading his Moral Inventory
He has tears streaming his face To the side - Aaron is
filming with his small mounted camera

GARY
Much like a normal couple we lived
that way and for a time it felt
normal Until my family
discovered the truth But I was
fooling myself Being fooled I was
seduced into sin by all sorts of
sinful people I knew in my heart
I had forsaken Jesus for Satan

Jared listens frowns This just seems like a regular caring
relationship being described He looks across to Jon who we
can see has a minor black eye Jon won’t engage

GARY (CONT’D)
But I am awake to my sins I can’t
believe the disgusting person that
I once was I ask --

The haunting SYNTHETIC music of ‘SPLINTER CELL’ Pulses --

SYKES OS
Lesbian Gay Bi --

INT LIA AUDITORIUM - DAY

On the board is a circle with several WORDS inside of it
Marriage Children family support caring In an opposing
circle is another list Rape child molestation promiscuity
AIDS loneliness zero children --

Sykes writes Heterosexual over the ‘GoodLIFE’ circle and
‘Homosexual’ and LGBTQ over the other He adds ‘D’ and ‘P’ as
well literally as a joke
SYKES
Transgender Queer Dolphins
Pandas Unicorns Cupcakes So much
choice over here

(MORE)

SYKES (CONTD)

It’s designed to make everyone laugh and most don’t but
Jared and Jon do Sykes adds ‘DEATH’ above the circle

SYKES (CONTD)
Talk about one way to ruin your
dollar bill To burn it by falling
right back into hell Inviting this
behavior into your life --

Move in on Jared as the ‘SPLINTER CELL’ theme riffs We will
recognize it and it will take us back to -

INT JARED’S DORM ROOM 346 - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
We are taken back to the night Henry crashes in Jared’s dorm

Jared plays alone for a beat but then finishes a game and
turns the console off casting the room into darkness

Later - Jared is lying on his bunk still awake Noises come
from the springs above Henry moving Turning After a while -

JARED
Can’t sleep huh
(no answer)
Probably shouldn’t run so late at
night

Then the figure of Henry jumps down in the darkness A weird
moment of pause as Jared turns to look at his silhouette

HENRY
Um

Jared frowns Something in the air Then -

Suddenly Henry lunges forward and clamps a hand over Jared’s
mouth Almost gently the command comes -

HENRY (CONTD)
Shhhh Shut up

In a weird and almost silent flurry Jared is forced to flip
over by Henry His sweats are pulled down and Henry is on
him

During the rapid and silent rape Jared’s head is knocked
against the upright strut arm of the bunk Then it is over
Henry recedes And all we hear is -
52A

HENRY OS
Damn it
(MORE )
HENRY 0S (CONTD)

Hold on Jared Paralyzed His forehead trickles blood

-- We hear Henry climb back up on the top bunk

Jared is confused What the hell just happened We hold on

this for the longest time Until -

Henry starts to cry Finally Jared moves ever so slightly

HENRY 0S (CONTD)
What is wrong with me What the
hell is wrong with me

Jared rolls over onto his back He listens to Henry cry

HENRY 0S (CONTD)
I’m going to be in so much trouble

JARED
Are you okay

HENRY
Oh man

JARED
Henry
(beat)
Have you done that before

Silence Long

HENRY
I need to confess I’m going to
have to will you hear me Can

Jared thinks and utters ‘Mmhmm’ And Henry jumps down

sits on Jared’s bed Jared doesn’t move

HENRY (CONTD)
I’m so sorry

Hold

one in front of us

INT JARED’S DORM ROOM 346 - MORNING

Jared wakes Cautiously he stands to see -

INT EAMONS FAMILY HOMEJARED’S ROOM - AFTERNOON
Jared sits on his bed reading A knock comes to the door

MARSHALL OS
Jared

Something in the tone of his voice makes Jared concerned

INT EAMONS FAMILY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

We SMASH INTO A FIERCE FAMILY ARGUMENT Jared IS AT WAR with
his father Under interrogation Nancy is the bystander

JARED MARSHALL
Did he give you a name Answer my question
JARED
If he gave you a name I’m just

saying why wouldn’t he give you -

MARSHALL
Answer me Are you doing all the
things he says

JARED
Did he give you his name

MARSHALL
Enough I command you -

JARED
- command me all you want I’m
asking questions too

Marshall makes a move toward Jared

NANCY
He didn’t give me his name
(wavers )
I don’t think
57A

They both look to Nancy

JARED
The guy is full of shit

MARSHALL
Nancy Leave the room

JARED
T1ll leave the room

MARSHALL
No You sit down

JARED
It’s bullshit dad
MARSHALL

NANCY MARSHALL (CONTD)
He just said ‘counselor’ I (a warning)
asked for his name -- -- Nancy
NANCY
--- and a number but
JARED MARSHALL
See NANCY

Nancy starts to retreat Finally she leaves

JARED
I can’t believe this

Marshall tries a new tactic trying to focus the conversation
MARSHALL
Okay son Let’s sit and talk

calmly Man to man

JARED
No Dad because it’s --

MARSHALL
-- Is it true He said you’ve
been that you are a homosexual

Jared sighs deeply He gets up and moves for the door

MARSHALL (CONTD)
Hey We are not finished
58A

JARED
I am Because you won’t listen
(MORE )

JARED (CONTD)
Jared tries to go to his room Marshall tries to intercept
him Nancy watches from the hallway
Jared tries to force the door shut which results in a
physical battle now with his father The door hits Marshalls

face knocking him backwards and bringing renewed fury

Marshall forces Jared against the wall

MARSHALL JARED (CONTD)
Answer me What this man (correcting)
says - What this full-of-shit guy

who is not a counselor and -
MARSHALL
Is it true
JARED MARSHALL (CONTD)

Who didn’t have the spine to Son

give his own name -

JARED
Who raped a kid at his Pentacostal
church group And God knows who
else

Marshall still grips his son but is rattled into stillness

JARED (CONTD)
Dad you’re hurting me

Questions rage in his father’s grip But the thought of
hurting his son wakes him from the attack

JARED (CONTD)
Dad It’s not true The guy is
lying I can tell you --

As Marshall slowly releases Jared steps forward He takes in
his mother and father flanking him

JARED (CONTD)
His name is Henry Wallace He’s not
a counselor He’s a student too He
told me he did some bad things

(beat)
I think he thinks I’m going to tell
on him

Pause The dust settles finally But Marshall’s radar is
tuned to the fact that he doesn’t have ALL the information

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jared is playing a game on his PLAYSTATION 2 FINAL DOOM -
Level 9 with its dread filled pipe-organ theme track Roaming
the pit he blasts demon soldiers and fiery skulls with a
double barrel shotgun Computer blood flows freely He is
deep in burying his reality when his father walks in

MARSHALL
Your mother is making dinner

JARED
I’m okay I’m not hungry

He pauses the game as Marshall sets down a note pad and pen

MARSHALL
I want you to write down this boy’s
name and the name of this
Pentecostal Church If he did what
you say then it needs to be
reported

JARED
I don’t want you to talk to him

MARSHALL
I think this matter is a little too
important for us to get into the
business of protecting anyone

Jared looks at the paper and pen Marshall moves to leave

MARSHALL (CONTD)

Eric is coming over tomorrow to
discuss rewiring for the new
ministry

(beat)
I extended the invitation to Chloe
and Brandy too Id appreciate it
if you stuck around another -

JARED
I really should get back

MARSHALL
If you can miss one day of classes
I’m sure one more is not going to
end the world
(beat)

MARSHALL (CONTD)
Why did you come back in the first
place Mid-week

The way he asks it still feels like he mistrusts his son

MARSHALL (CONTD)
You know there is nothing like the
feeling of being with a woman
If you knew what it was like -

JARED
Dad It’s not true

Jared goes to put his head phones on
MARSHALL
You know what I think about those

kind of games too

Marshall leaves Distracted Jared is swamped by soldiers
Game Over He sits in silence for a moment and then -

Jared explodes The closest thing we have seen to rage He
rips the cord from the controller out of the system and
throws it across the room

INT EAMONS FAMILY KITCHEN - NIGHT

Marshall looks at his ministry architectural plans while
Nancy preps dinner A somber mood Broken as -

Jared enters and drops the ENTIRE gaming system on the table

You want me to stop with the games

His parents are puzzled

JARED (CONTD)
Ok I’11 stop with them

Pause

JARED (CONTD)
I don’t want to see Chloe

We broke up

And he exits leaving his parents confused But then -
Moments later he is back ---

61A

Jared is trying to find the words It’s hard but he’s going
to stay until the message gets across Finally

Marshall swoops up his architect plans and leaves the room
There is a long pause Until Nancy awkwardly pipes up

NANCY
Are you sure honey
INT JARED’S ROOM - FAMILY HOME - NIGHT
Jared is watching through a crack in the door He sees -

In the kitchen his father sitting embracing his mother Then
he hears a car and moves to the window He is alarmed to see

Two men approach the house Big Jim and Pastor Wilkes
Marshall walks to greet them It’s definitely conspiratorial
And it’s definitely something to do with Jared He moves to
the landing to watch them enter the house careful to avoid
being seen
MARSHALL

Thanks for coming Jim Pastor

boiled egg

INT THE BEST WESTERN BUFFET ROOM - MORNING

Nancy holds a bedazzled phone in overly manicured hands
Bangles rattle and rings knock against bigger rings
Meanwhile Jared scans the room looking for Jon

NANCY
We’re about to find out

As Jared cracks the top off a soft-boiled egg Nancy
stretches out those hands in suspenseful expectation The
pantomime of ‘Did they get it right’ One of their many
‘games’ Off Jared’s reaction she clenches her fists
‘foiled again’

NANCY (CONTD)

Overcooked

(into the phone)
If they have an office in Memphis
I could check the color swatches
down here I think a muted green is
a good match with oak Blue is
always a little dominant
regardless of shade

Jared goes back to scanning the room Then he finds -

Jon Trailed by a guy (20s) An older brother Jared guesses
an even manlier version of Jon The brother hangs back to
talk on his cell as Jon hits the buffet

INT THE BEST WESTERN - MORNING

Jared plants himself at the buffet waiting to be seen

JON
Plate

Jared almost answers but then realizes it’s not an offering
for him Instead - Jon’s brother brushes past

BROTHER
I said I’11 look after myself

JON
You want a juice
63A

And so it comes to be that Jon COMPLETELY IGNORES JARED

BROTHER
Look after yourself I got mine

Jared hangs self-consciously filling his plate until it’s
safe to walk back to the table

INT THE BEST WESTERN BUFFET ROOM - MORNING

Jared sits back down at the table stung He is handed the
phone by Nancy

Okay You tell yourself that

MOMENTS LATER Jared sits drinking tea on his own

JON OS
Listen man -

Jon plants himself in another chair

JON

You gotta think about why you went
there Seriously You don’t think I
wasn’t fishing for where you were
staying when I told you my hotel
These are the urges we gotta stamp
out Whole reason we’re even here
Gotta control this

He taps his head too hard Admonishing

JARED
We were just looking for somewhere
that could do boiled eggs properly

JARED (CONTD)

Jon gives a ‘sure you were’ grunt then jumps up seeing
Cameron is throwing a football inside with Tina He joins We
sees Cameron suddenly relaxed and happy to have a football
in his hands

Jared stands too beside Jon They take turns throwing back
to Cameron who is now joined by Tina The group keep
throwing but suddenly STOP when they hear the door open

SYKES
You don’t have to stop

In the BG Sykes starts re-arranging chairs with Michael
SYKES OS
Football is okay S’long as you

Sykes jumps in and starts throwing with them It becomes
awkward but sort of fun The whole group encouraged to join

in Some do Some don’t Jared watches the madness Then --

He throws the ball to Cameron who catches it happily as --

INT LIA MAIN AUDITORIUM - DAY

Cameron is in the chair now He is doing the Lie Chair

It’s so quiet that everyone has to lean in to hear him
Aaron behind the camera gestures to Sykes ‘volume’

SYKES
We can’t hear you Cameron

CAMERON
- hate you for the way you have
treated me since you found out
about my problems

SYKES
‘About my sins’ Say it Cameron

Cameron looks like he wants to disappear Jared intervenes

JARED
I can go I don’t mind -

SYKES
(shutting him down)
Everyone gets a turn This is
Cameron’s turn Cameron ‘Found out
about my sins’ --

CAMERON

Found out about my sins
SYKES

Louder
CAMERON

(trying still soft)
-- I hate you because you never
listen to me or acknowledge me Or
if you do acknowledge me it’s to
make fun of me --

SYKES
‘IT’S TO MAKE FUN OF ME’

CAMERON
-- in front of other people or -
You just yell at me --
Sykes decides to let Cameron work at his own volume
CAMERON (CONT’D)
When you told me you wished I
hadn’t been born that really hurt

Cameron stops reading from his notes He looks at Sykes
SYKES
Well you say that you are angry
but frankly I don’t see it ‘That
really hurt

67A

SYKES (CONTD)

(nothing from Cameron)
I wanna see you express it

Cameron sighs Something is definitely inside of him -

SYKES (CONTD)
Only then can we have a chance to
tell these people in the real world
how they have affected us

Cameron’s wraps his arms around himself

SYKES (CONT’D)
Where is that anger Cameron You
wanna learn and grow Well
(turns away)
I guess not Oh well
(to the group)
S’up to you

Sykes urges the others to go on break and they all file
around Cameron who sits feeling a failure in the chair -

But then - they hear an almighty noise and turn to see -

- Cameron bring the chair crashing down like a pick-axe on
the empty chair opposite POUNDING it repeatedly Everyone is
in shock When the dust settles they all stare at Cameron
and Cameron back at them --

CAMERON
Um Sorry

Cameron looks around like he has made a mistake He retreats
into apologies and starts to pick up what he’s broken

SYKES
It’s okay It’s okay Take a break
Cameron I’1ll get that

CAMERON
I’m sorry That’s just how I
express my anger so --

Jared watches Cameron retreat back into his massive shell

INT LIA BATHROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Jared steps up to pee Unbuttoning he sees a shape pass the
high window Curious he hoists himself up and can see -

Sykes alone and in the magical afternoon light staring at
the tree line Hands on his hips Jared immediately wonders
about him Then the door swings open and Jared steps down -

BRANDON OS
You’re meant to attend bathroom
breaks with a staff member

Brandon eyes him cautiously and Jared goes to exit --

BRANDON
What you not gonna pee now

Jared realizes his mistake Looks at his unbuttoned pants

BRANDON (CONTD)
Or were you gonna do something
solo That’s why they make the
rules

Jared turns back to pee It’s a fearful stop-start pee

BRANDON (CONTD)
Sounds like Morse code You sending
me a message faggot

Finished Jared goes to walk out Brandon turns on the tap to
for him to wash He complies Now Brandon gets awful close
and hands him a paper towel

BRANDON (CONTD)
I do not get you guys at all Too
much mothering and not enough
fathering I can’t be both for you

Finally Jared is allowed to leave

INT NANCY’S CAR - DAY

Jared rides back from LIA deep in his head Nancy drives
wondering if she should respect the silence or probe --

NANCY
It’s still early Do you want to
watch a movie

(MORE)

NANCY (CONTD)

JARED
I got homework still Plus
I can’t anyway The rules say all
movies contain ‘sinful content’

NANCY
What about an animation

JARED
‘What’d you do last night’ ‘I was
hanging at the Hampton Inn watching
The Lion King with my mom’

Jared winds his window down Nancy turns off the air -

NANCY
You want fresh air

Jared reaches out his hand and his hand dances with the air

NANCY (CONT’D)
Honey You know I don’t like -

JARED
Mom Who did that happen to and
when Seriously Do you know

Nancy retreats into silence But Jared is spoiling for a
fight

JARED (CONTD)
Seriously Do you actually know who
that happened to Do you For real

After another silence -

JARED (CONTD)
It was Nobody From Nowhere Town
(beat)
On Highway Zero It never happened

Now she feels the right to bite back

NANCY
Parents want to protect their kids

JARED
So they feed them lies

NANCY
I think those are okay lies
70A

Jared realizing he’s been unfairly combative pulls his hand
back just a little bit

JARED
You know the whole thing you and
Dad are paying for here is all
about how messed up we are by our
parents They want to know about
you That’s why you can’t know all
about it Cause then they wouldn’t
get their money out of you

NANCY

What have I ever done to you I’m
not a drunk or a divorcee Your
father and I don’t fight We barely
even raise our voices

(beat)
Talk about me however you want my
conscience is clean

Nancy stops She hit ‘my’ a little too hard Silence

NANCY (CONTD)

I think I should read the book too

(beat)
See what it’s all about Read these
rules and what not

(no answer)
They get to discuss us I think we
should know about them too We are
paying for it and trusting them
with your care

Jared winds his window up Happy He leans against the glass

INT HAMPTON INN AND SUITES - NIGHT

Jared and his mother schlep down the hallway Five steps
behind his mother Jared’s step is heavy and tired

INT HAMPTON INN AND SUITES - ROOM - NIGHT
Jared sits on his bed as his mother showers in the bathroom -

Jared flips open his phone and finds the number Sarah dialed
two days before He presses dial after a moment of
deliberation Waits Then -

YOUNG FEMALE VOICE
Hello Sarah
(beat)
Sarah is that you
71A

Jared hangs up Soon he turns to find Nancy there

NANCY
Honey Is everything okay

He nods She holds up the handbook That’s when he notices
she has taken it from the nightstand

NANCY (CONT’D)
I’m reading it No debate I need
to know what’s inside of it

JARED
I don’t see why anyone would read
it unless you absolutely had to

INT HAMPTON INN AND SUITES - NANCY’S ROOM
We push slowly toward Nancy’s room as -

JARED 0OS
You can read it at night when I’m
here if you seriously want to
(beat)
There are tons of spelling errors
in it I almost wanna mark up a
copy for them But -

Nancy reads the Love In Action handbook with interest by her
bedside light She frowns as we hear -

JARED OS (CONTD)
- that would take away the only
real enjoyment you get from reading
it Cause I guess its actually
not much fun to be there

Whatever she has read - a rule a task or an ideology - it
troubles her She looks across at her son

JARED OS (CONTD)
At least if you turn to page ‘87
you can enjoy that the goofball
that transcribed it was typing so
fast -

Nancy remembering guiltily turns the page to eighty-seven --

JARED OS (CONTD)
- he wrote ‘Dog’ instead of God

We read the line as Nancy’s manicured finger runs along it
“and so we always come back to Dog’s true design

JARED OS (CONTD)
Itd be a shame to ruin the next
poor kids fun
Tight on Nancy as she smiles ruefully and whispers --
NANCY
Almighty Dog
INT THE EAMONS FAMILY HOME KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Nancy washes dishes We move in on her slowly from behind
The clatter of dishes Then she stops rock still

She is crying

And we pull back - there behind her on the table is Jareds
gaming console It’s the night Jared declared himself

She hears men entering the house and turns so we see her
mascara stained cheeks She leaves the room

OS Sounds of Nancy vomiting

INT UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - NIGHT

Nancy post vomit steps up to the mirror and redoes her eye-
liner With each application she calms herself with -

NANCY
Everything Is Going To Be --

Hearing noise she puts on her happy voice

NANCY (CONTD)
One minute

JARED OS
Mom

NANCY
Oh Yes honey
73A

JARED
Why are Pastor Wilkes and Jim
Picard here

(MORE)

JARED (CONTD)

NANCY

I think your father is having a
meeting

(no point lying)
Because of that call today and what
you just told us

(beat)
Pastor Wilkes has dealt with this
kind of thing before Jim’s son
Sam When you were just a boy

JARED
What did they do to him

Nancy smiles and then laughs She embraces him

NANCY
Oh silly They didn’t do anything
to him They did things for him
Just like your father is wondering
what to do for you To help you
(beat)

You go to your room Everything is
going to be okay I promise

INT STAIRWELL LANDING - NIGHT

Jared sits on the stairs listening to murmured conversation
but not being able to hear clearly Suddenly Marshall appears
at the base of the stairs

MARSHALL
Can we see you in the kitchen
please

INT EAMONS FAMILY KITCHEN - NIGHT
Jared led by his father enters the kitchen -
MARSHALL
You know Pastor Wilkes and Jim
obviously
Jared says his ‘hellos’ curious about the stack of brochures
of a ‘Christian Nature’ that are piled on the table The

LIA logo of the heart in a triangle is prominent here

His father seems strung out and tired but there is a
paternal care and gentleness that still exists despite

MARSHALL (CONTD)
We have one question and then I’11
let you sleep It’s been a big day
I’ve shared our conversation with
these two fine and trustworthy men
and asked for their guidance Now
we don’t have all the answers but
you hold the key to the next step
(beat)
In your heart do you wanna change

Hold It is a big question

MARSHALL (CONTD)

And I have to be forthright here
before you answer I don’t think
continuing to live and be part of
things at home is going to be easy
for you if the answer is ‘no’ I
don’t wanna make that a more bitter
pill to swallow but if the answer
is ‘no’ then I have to be tough and
protect my needs with the ministry
taking flight and my commitment to
my whole flock

(beat)
Your mother and I can’t see a way
to have you under this roof and
attending service and working at
the dealership and driving that car
if you go against the grain of our
beliefs

There it is - an ultimatum Jared looks at his mother who
can’t bear to look at him In that moment he feels alone

MARSHALL (CONTD)
Well son

LONG Pause

JARED
Yes Yes I wanna change

MARSHALL
I was hoping for a quicker answer
But okay
(beat)
Can you be free in the morning for
your mother to take you to see Dr
Muldoon
(Jared frownsnods
(MORE )
MARSHALL (CONTD)

Then Pastor Wilkes has invited us
to accompany him to the jail
tomorrow

(the Pastor’s steely look)
Take a seat -

They all link hands

PASTOR WILKES
Heavenly Father Look down on us
now with your wisdom and unleash
your power for one of your flock
Jared who has lost his way We

pray Lord that you make him pure

Sound starts to fade out --

PASTOR WILKES (CONT’D)
And deliver him safely back to us
See the errors of his mind as
nothing more than what it is - a
momentary straying

EXT ARKANSAS STRIP MALL - MORNING

Jared and his mother walk We follow them Nancy puts on her

dark glasses She turns to look over her shoulder

is nervous they are being watched That people know

INT DR MULDOON’S WAITING ROOM - MORNING

Jared sits in a waiting room with a couple other folk The
door opens and Nancy and Dr Beverly Muldoon come

DR MULDOON
Jared
(to Nancy)
I’1l see him alone if that’s okay

Nancy takes Jared’s seat

INT DR MULDOON’S OFFICE - DAY
Jared sits opposite doctor Jane

DR MULDOON
Your father has asked me to take
some of your blood and check for
testosterone levels Jared Is that
okay with you

(MORE)

DR MULDOON (CONTD)

He shrugs

DR MULDOON (CONTD)

You know anything we discuss here
is just between you and me Both
ways I hope that’s okay

He nods She leans forward with kindness

DR MULDOON (CONT’D)

I’m in a little bind here Jared
And I said this to your mother too
Now I’m a religious woman no
question but I’ve also been to
medical school So I guess you
could say I hold science in one
hand and God in the other And
that’s not always an easy balance

Jared seems confused so she drops the round-a-bout speak

DR MULDOON (CONTD)

We won’t find any answers in your
blood Jared I wish I could say
otherwise And then send you to the
pharmacy for a pill that will
magically fix you But that’s not
going to happen

On Jared

DR MULDOON (CONTD)
I’m going to take your blood and I
know what it will tell me That you
are a perfectly normal and very
healthy teenage boy It’s not my
place to tell you your parents are
wrong But

(beat)
There is a different opinion - a
medical one - that says that they
are wrong And well -

(it hangs)
What happens next is still your
choice It may not feel that way
but it is That’s all

Jared hears what she is saying He’s just not sure yet
exactly what the ‘next’ is

DR MULDOON (CONTD)
Do you have any questions for me
(MORE )

DR MULDOON (CONTD)

He doesn’t She looks at him with a maternal air and then
knowing what may be ahead of him offers him this -

DR MULDOON (CONTD)
Well just know you can call me any
time Now or anytime in the future

She slides her card writing her cell number on the back (We
saw this card during Jareds induction into LIA)

DR MULDOON (CONTD)
Okay Which arm you want me to
excavate

INT CAR DEALERSHIPLUNCH ROOM - DAY

Jared alone eats His sleeves are rolled up and a cotton
bud taped in the crook of his left arm He watches -

Through the glass Nancy and Marshall in conversation with
Big Jim Jim heads for the lunch room

JIM

Hey pal Your father wanted me to
show you something

(beat)
I think your mom told you about my
son Sam Ten years ago he was in
the same spot you’re in pretty
much Here -

Jared looks at the photo Jim hands him A happy family
portrait A smiling middle-aged guy a slightly overweight
woman and their three children a girl 8 and twin boys 5

JIM (CONTD)
This is him today Happy as a clam
(beat)
Don’t know if that helps But
it’s all possible my friend

Marshall knocks on the door ‘Ready’ Jim tucks the photo
back in his pocket and pats Jared on the shoulder

JIM (CONTD)
I’m rooting for ya pal
78A

INT PRISON - DAY

Jared trails Pastor Wilkes and Marshall as they go through
the prison security check

A big multi-bag of peanut MandM’s gets scanned along with
three King James Bibles and pamphlets

MARSHALL

Candy to anyone who can recite at
least two verses from the bible

(beat)
If a want for candy tricks them
into finding truth in the gospel
then -- We have to appeal to their
lower natures before we can appeal
to their higher ones

Jared nods Marshall seeing Jared’s fear offers hima
reassuring pat on the shoulder

INT PRISON HALLWAY - DAY

Jared terrified and wary stands carrying the MandM bags He
watches as his father consoles a prisoner with truly great
compassion Then he hears his name called Pastor Wilkes
needs a bag of MandM’s Jared steps closer to the cell he is
in trying not to make eye contact with the prisoner

PASTOR WILKES
This is where the fallen land You
see Look around you son

INT MARSHALL’S CAR —- DAY
Marshall and Jared approach the car Marshall eats MandMs

Then hands the bag to Jared who is still deep in memory of
the pastor’s warning They get in -

MARSHALL

You going to stay for dinner Or --
JARED

I should probably make a start

today
Hold Marshall puts his hand on Jared’s shoulder

MARSHALL
We’1l get through this son

Then Marshall turns on the radio Credence Clearwater revival
blasts out There’s a Bad Moon on the Rise

INTEXT JARED’S CARHIGHWAY - DAY

Jared on the side of the highway where people only usually
stop because their car has broken down He is in the midst of

apanic attack trying to regulate his breathing

He gets out and closes the door leaning against the car He
manages to calm himself a little

VRrrrmmm The sounds of trucks racing past by catches his
attention Soon he steps forward until -

He is very close to the edge Might he just step forward and
solve all his problems on the grill of a speeding semi One

driver HONKS a warning Finally -

Jared walks back to the car kicking out at the side mirror

breaking it He gets back in the car and starts the ignition
His complicated life must keep going

INT HAMPTON INN AND SUITES - MORNING (PRESENT)
Nancy wakes up She looks around Jared is gone
On his freshly made bed she finds a note -

‘Xavier’
Henry has been scratched out Nancy seems concerned She
moves to the bed and covers herself entirely with the sheet
Hold
EXT HIGHWAY - MORNING

Jared walks along the gravelled edge of the highway He reads
a handful of pages rehearsing for his Moral Inventory

Then - A pick-up pulls next to him Jon’s brother’s car

JON
Yo Need a ride
80A

Jared sees Jon’s brother in the driver’s seat eyes front

JARED
Thanks but I got a little while I
thought I’d walk Looking through
my stuff for today

Jon understands ‘Okay’ The pick-up pushes on Then -

Up ahead it slows and stops Then Jon gets out slamming the
door His brother blasts the horn and completes a screeching
U-turn as Jon walks toward Jared Shrugs it off

CUT TO

EXT PATHWAYPARK - DAY

Jared and Jon have taken a short cut through a park Jared
waits as Jon finishes peeing behind an old abandoned car

JON

So I got all these feelings in me
obviously Toward men and so on
Have since I was thirteen or so
But I never did anything about it
Then when I got older and
discovered booze I’d get real
drunk and I’d let my guard down
Basically I’d wrestle guys and
fight just to get the contact ina
way that seemed okay But you
know people started to notice and
talk Guess I’d go too far too
often

(beat)
Then one party I get real drunk
I mean like super crazy drunk and
while a bunch of people are
cheering me and watching me wrestle
this kid I kiss this dude like
full on on the mouth

(beat)
I think in my haze I thought it was
okay ‘cause I figured it would look
like a domination over a kid
everyone was already suspect over

Jared listens deeply curious
JON (CONTD)
Then I guess I realized in the
moment how it looked to everyone
and I tried to start the wrestling
charade again

(MORE)

81A
JON (CONTD)
But when I saw it wasn’t working
I had to do something and so --
(He sighs deeply)
I really started to whale on this
kid like choked him out and beat
his face in like bad bad bad
bad bad Bad
(beat)
And when it was done I remember I
stood up all messy and put my fist
in the air like I’d just won at the
UFC or something whack and I
was waiting for the cheers and --

Jared waits - walks -

Pause

Pause

Jared absorbs this Jon knows he can’t change He just

JON (CONT’D)
Everyone’s faces were like dead
still Like -‘What the fuck just
happened

JON (CONT’D)
I haven’t been home since
(beat)
I’m sorry for it But it’s also
what got me to where I am So

JON (CONTD)
And I’m committed I’m not here to
waste anyone’s time don’t get me
wrong but -

(beat)

- I am what I am I don’t think
there is any changing me and my
thoughts and whatnot But I do know
by staying off the drink and making
certain choices I can just choke
that side of me away Put it aside
There is a difference Whether you
can actually change or just choose
different things

believes he can put his desires in a drawer

JON (CONT’D)
Haven’t touched another guy since
That’s why I don’t even shake hands
you know I’ve just decided that’s
it for me Whatever it takes

(MORE )

JON (CONTD)

Jon kicks a rock

JON (CONT’D)
What you got
(beat)
What’s your big crazy story

Jared absorbs what he has on his meager pages
JON (CONT’D)
Sykes’s gonna decide you know
based on what you say today
whether you stay another month
three months six A year
Finally Jared stops
JARED
I don’t really have a crazy story
We ah probably shouldn’t walk in
together

And they walk in silence for some time --

EXT LIA HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Jared approaches to see Sykes on the steps conferring with

two OLDER MEN One a striking man with silver hair and sharp
features and a shiny-bald stocky man Both in their fifties

Sykes sees Jared

SYKES
Today’s going to run a little
differently I’1l be inside soon

INT LIA MAIN AUDITORIUM - DAY
There is trash bag in the center of the room and from it
the members of the group are trying on black and dark-blue

blazer coats as instructed by Michael and Aaron

JON
What’s going on Michael

MICHAEL
Sykes can tell you Try this on

Jon and Jared try on coats They are handed ties too as -
Sykes enters looking troubled

SYKES
Everybody sit down Michael Aaron
You can start on the windows

Jared sees a MASSIVE roll of black material Duct tape etc
He wonders “what the hell is going on”

And then the door opens and a couple of STAFF lug a funeral
casket into the room Aaron runs to help

SYKES (CONT’D)
Okay We haven’t got much time and
I need your help
Sykes signs for the casket Then he turns to the group
SYKES (CONT’D)
There’s been a situation with

Cameron overnight

Everyone sinks Is Cameron dead

SYKES (CONTD)
Cameron has broken some serious
rules and in conference with his
father and their church elders
weve decided to offer hima
chance To shock him into recovery

Jared is confused

SYKES (CONTD)
Today Cameron is going to choose to
be dead to his life and to his
family or to truly surrender

INT LIA MAIN AUDITORIUM - DAY

The room is now cast in darkness the windows blacked out
Candles flicker and dim lamps otherwise illuminate the room
The centerpiece is the casket Slivers of sun infiltrate

Jared Simon Jon Carl all are in attendance

Jared looks across to a handful of NEW PEOPLE CAMERONS
FAMILY and CLOSE FRIENDS An OLDER BROTHER and SISTER And
TWO YOUNGER SIBLINGS The two younger ones are confused and
are teary-eyed CAMERON’S MOTHER also attends along with
Cameron’s LOCAL MINISTER (the balding man we saw earlier)
Plus a couple of FOOTBALL TEAMMATES along with their COACH
84A

Sykes enters He gestures for everyone to stand He grabs a
chair and sets it down beside the casket facing the group

SYKES
Here
The BALD MAN nods approval Sykes is not in control here

Then a knock at the door alerts him --

Sykes opens the door Cameron BLINDFOLDED is led by his
FATHER and Rev Neil the silver haired man

Jared looks deeply concerned It looks more backyard
improvised and pagan-like than truly Christian

Brandon starts a classic funeral dirge on the Hi-fi system
OPUS 35 - Chopin

Cameron is taken to his seat by the casket They unmask him
and when he sees his family gathered together plus the
casket his weeping deepens Understandably he is scared

Jared squirms

REVEREND NEIL

Sadly we are gathered here today
to say farewell to our son our
brother and friend Cameron Van
Huessen who by his own making
last night fell prey to Satan’s
wishes falling farther away from
God

(beat)
But the Heavenly Father in the
wisdom of his mercy hasn’t had his
last word on this boy’s soul -

Jared watches as --

-- Music starts drowning out the ‘service’ The beatific -
Moonlight Sonata by Beethoven

----- as it plays we see -----
Various images in slow motion to the music

- Cameron wraps himself in his big arms and folds over Sykes
attends him holding him in place

- Camerons sisters hug each other
- The bald Minister opens the coffin as Cameron is led there

by Sykes and Rev Neil A pantomime where the message is
clear Does Cameron want to DIE or BE REBORN
85A

- Cameron shakes his head fervently He doesnt want to die

- They crowd around Cameron offering an ultimatum He nods
his head still in tears fully submitting

- Sykes gestures to Aaron and Michael who rip the black
material off the walls letting the light in

- Cameron kneels eyes shut hands up surrendering himself
Rev Neil places a hand on Camerons head In a wild jolting
gesture he PUSHES to CAST the demons out

- Others join him doing the same

- Camerons Father pushes Camerons head aggressively
Cameron falls backwards to the ground

- Camerons brother is handed a bible He strikes Cameron
with it Camerons anguished face as he rolls over tears
streaming

- Various people are encouraged to strike Cameron with bibles
and other books Harder and harder they strike

- Later Cameron vomits in a trash can held by Brandon Rev
Neil brings him back to his knees

- Jon is handed a bible He stands Jared watching him
- Jon strikes Cameron with the bible

- Cameron stands with the help of those around him His
sisters are close

The music carries through -

EXT DRIVEWAYSTREETS - LATER

- Cameron walks the street propped up by his father and
others The full congregation snakes behind

Jared is right up the back Sarah near him They share a
look

- They walk up the path toward a house New Hope House The
Men’s ‘long stay’ house we have been hearing of Follow into -
INT NEW HOPE HOUSE - DAY

Seen through Jared’s POV A suburban house with all doors

removed and closed circuit surveillance cameras in the corner
of EACH ROOM HE notices as they pass -
86A

The ONLY DOOR in the house It has two PADLOCKS securing it

INT NEW HOPE HOUSE BATHROOM - DAY

Jared watches through the crowd as Cameron is placed in the
basic shower bath-tub of the small bathroom

There he is baptized with his father and mother close
encouraged by Rev Neil to place their hands on him

His big body shudders and his strong arms reach out for the
water Like a massive baby Full surrender

Jared watches mute
The only thing that makes this even remotely bearable is that
Cameron seems ecstatic and accepting of his REBIRTH His

arms clawing for God reaching for a loving embrace

Beethovens music underpins the whole horrible beautiful
scene

Jared sees Sykes on the edge of the action involved but not
really Jared turns to go unable to watch anymore
Interestingly Sykes doesnt try and stop him But -

Jon does He grabs for Jareds arm Jared shakes him off

EXT NEW HOPE HOUSE HALLWAY - DAY
Jared moves into the hall escaping the horror He is alone

GARY OS
Starting to see it for what it is

Gary is standing by the corner

GARY
They catch him with another boy in
a steam room and what do they do

(beat)

You seem smart You want my advice
Tell them everything they need to
hear and play the part You’re up
any day now Let them know you’re
understanding your mistakes
getting better that it’s working
Think all my stories and my tears
were real ‘Fake it to make it’
None of this is going to help any
The sooner you are out of here and
home the better

(MORE )
87A

GARY (CONTD)
And the sooner we are all out of
home and somewhere else the better -
(that hangs
(MORE)

GARY (CONTD)
You don’t want to end up at one of
these houses for any amount of
time I’ve heard the stories and
they are not good
A muffled chorus and shout comes from the bathroom
GARY (CONT’D)
Unless you really think you can
change Or want to

INT HAMPTON INN AND SUITES - NIGHT

The music continues as -

Jared walks the hall with his mother Seen from behind they
walk away and enter the room leaving an empty hallway Hold

And the music ends on a deep base note -

EXT MEMPHIS MOTEL MILE - NIGHT

Jared runs exorcising the days events Hood up he pounds
the pavement past the various motels The rushing oncoming
cars WHOOSH past like his dark thoughts

Later As he passes a bus shelter he comes to a stop A strip
mall in the background Not a soul about He takes a seat on
a bench to catch his breath and when he looks back he sees -

On the outside of the bus shelter a beatific advertising
image of a SHIRTLESS GUY lit and inviting Jared looks away
but something draws him back His nature

Then something fierce wells up in him and he gets up as if
he is looking around for something Leaves frame Hold We
hear noises of effort

He soon returns with a heavy paving stone He is about to
launch the missile at the advertising image However --

On the approach the poster slides to the NEXT ad a woman
in a swim suit It railroads his intentions

JARED
Arghhhh

He throws the paver anyway and it bounces off the Perspex
shield doing minimal damage He sits down drained Defeated

JARED (CONTD)
Fuck
(turning skyward)
Fuck you I hate you Fuck you
FUUUUUUCK

He waits Nothing Then -

The advertising image slides back to the beatific male
image But now buckled by the assault its mechanism falters
and sticks halfway We move in on Jared Recognition Memory
The man the face albeit obscured with fracture glass
reminds him of something Someone

SNAP TO BLACK

INTEXT JARED’S CARCOLLEGE DORM BUILDING - LATE
AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)

Jared parks the car He is dressed as he was the day of the
prison visit The day he had his panic attack on the highway
and had thoughts of suicide We know this too because when he
gets out he inspects the freshly broken side window

INT COLLEGE DORM BUILDING - EARLY EVENING

Jared lugs his overnight bag dragging his feet Depleted
He lumbers past a bulletin board then stops Backs up

An image of Christ It’s a western depiction of Jesus where
the man himself could have signed with a California modeling
agency The words ‘God vs Science’ pop out

He steps closer and takes the flyer in his hands It is
advertising for a college art exhibition

EXT JARED’S DORM ROOM 346 - NIGHT

Jared unlocks his room He notices behind him TWO STUDENTS
whisper gossip about him Has word gotten around somehow
Then he looks into the room -

INT JARED’S DORM ROOM 346 - NIGHT

Inside his room has been trashed He enters cautiously
89A

Then he stops - Just above his bunk bed mattress is a crudely
spray-painted message ‘DIE HOMO

- He corrects a fallen chair and finds a bottle of wine

- Room fixed up Jared sits on his bed holding the bottle He
turns over the flyer in his hands then puts it aside He
opens the bottle sniffing the booze ‘Die Fag’ behind him

INT LYON CAMPUS ARTS BUILDING FOYER - NIGHT

A section of the Fine Arts building turned gallery space
People mill about A decent crowd Jared steps into frame

He raises a glass of wine to his lips He is staring at -

The Mormon style image of Jesus The same ultra-color Blonde
depiction as the flyer The actual artwork is five feet by
six HUGE We see that in Jesus’s hand is an image of a CELL
PHONE It’s controversial in a playful way

To Jared it is distasteful and somewhat irrelevant Trite He
turns and places his drink down and suddenly stops seeing --

A BEAUTIFUL BOY gesturing to a small group about an
image MARY Arms in offering a Virtual Reality system on
her face Someone in the group shakes his hands in
congratulations and he nods humbly in thanks This is the
ARTIST Xavier

Jared is transfixed Not by the image but by Xavier
And then Xavier catches him and looks right back He steps in

front of the image so that he appears Jesus-like Divine
Marys offering arms seem to be his

Jared does not turn away Xavier gestures ‘cheers’ with his
wine and moves away Jared keeps staring

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Jared walks an expansive hallway alone Soon -

Xavier comes into frame following Then he takes the lead
90A

INT XAVIERS STUDIO ROOM - NIGHT

They walk in together As the door closes the music stops

There is minimal improvised and eclectic furniture in this
studio space Beyond it Jared can see at the far end a bed
room lit by warm lamp light

Xavier puts on Otis Redding - Change is Gonna Come Vinyl

XAVIER OS
I’m having some wine Do you want
some more

When Xavier speaks he has a slight European accent French
Swiss It is hard to tell

Jared looks around at the motley pictures hanging Subversive
religious images magazine cut-outs plus sketches of people
and shapes Curated by a novice yet somehow captivating

JARED
Where are you from Xavier

XAVIER OS
I lived in thirteen countries
before I left high school Born in
Vienna Ended up in Canada Now
here

He approaches with a red wine Jared takes it

JARED
Do you believe in God
XAVIER
Serious
JARED

Why is that serious

Jared is buoyed by drink It is a bold side of him we have
never seen Perhaps some things are possible with booze that
otherwise are not as we may remember from Jon’s tale

Like with that - this encounter should carry an edge that
carries the possibility of that same danger

JARED (CONTD)
Do you believe in God or not Your
whole art thing is --

XAVIER
I do I was raised with religion
and I question it but I still
believe in God

(MORE)

XAVIER (CONTD)

JARED
Who created the earth

Xavier laughs That’s a BIG question

XAVIER
You like a little small talk huh

JARED
I don’t think you can believe in
science and religion equally

Xavier frowns not ready to engage in the seriousness

JARED (CONTD)
Don’t you think you have to pick a
side Don’t they cancel each other
out

XAVIER
Well paper beats rock Then no one
can believe in God

JARED
Why

XAVIER
Because science has shown itself
and God has not

JARED
Sure he has

XAVIER
Not all the time Science shows
itself all the time It’s always
around us developing Does God show
himself enough Where is He
(off Jareds expression)
Wait till you really suffer

Jared seems to be getting either angry now or emotional He
may lash out physically OR sexually or totally crumble
It is hard to tell

Xavier walks away

When he comes back he has a joint He lights it Jared has
never been this close to drugs

XAVIER (CONTD)
Do you believe in the devil
92A

Jared’s silence is a yes
XAVIER (CONTD)
Does he look like me

JARED
I don’t know

XAVIER
Because he also doesn’t show
himself

Jared surprises us by taking the joint He takes a toke

After a long beat

JARED
You know Job From the Bible

XAVIER
Not personally

Jared sees the humor in it

XAVIER (CONTD)
I hear he’s not great company
Always complaining

Jared cracks up Then gets real He has to make his

JARED
I imagine I’m him sometimes That
God and the Devil are having a bet
over me That one day he’1ll show
himself to me and let me in on the
experiment he was having to test
me

XAVIER

You just summed it all up

(beat)
People hoping someone is watching
over them That hard times are part
of a design

(beat)
I think we are our own test Our
own judgement Our own god Meaning
I think he is in us All of us Not
somewhere watching and hiding

Jared thinks about this

XAVIER (CONTD)
Stay with me

point
93A

Jared is not flinching

XAVIER (CONTD)
Nothing needs to happen I swear

Nothing from Jared
XAVIER (CONTD)
I’1l prove to you that God won’t

strike you down

JARED
What if you are the devil

XAVIER
Then you are too

He backs away
XAVIER OS
We are the same I could be you or
you could be me
Soon Jared looks back for the door but instead he watches
Xavier who disappears into the warm glow of his bedroom den

INT XAVIERS BEDROOM DEN - NIGHT

From above Jared and Xavier lie down The music filters in
from the other room

They look at each other

They hold hands And that’s it

INT XAVIER’S DEN - MORNING

Jared wakes up to full sunlight Xavier is facing him asleep
Jared looks down They are still holding hands and still
fully clothed Jared slowly releases his hand from Xaviers

He stares for some time then finally moves out of frame

Jared dripping wet stands before the mirror in his running
gear staring at himself The shower runs in the BG Then we

Contemplating Phone poised he actually starts to dial Then
he thinks better of it and takes off his shirt walking into

I feel invigorated I feel hopeful
that so much is possible

Jared steals a look at Cameron Cameron does not seem to be
sharing the same vigor He seems truly sunk

SYKES (CONT’D)

SYKES (CONTD)

CAMERON
I feel great Sir

SYKES
Do you feel the true presence of
God in your heart

CAMERON
Yes sir

SYKES
It feels great don’t it

CAMERON
Yes sir It does for sure

Jared catches Gary’s eye A shared skepticism Then he
catches Jon’s eye but Jared turns away almost coldly Things
have shifted between the two of them Broken

SYKES OS
Ready when you are Jared

INT LIA MAIN AUDITORIUM - MOMENTS LATER
Jareds hands squeeze his papers for his Moral Inventory
We hold on Jared’s face through --

JARED

I had thoughts of men

JARED (CONTD)

SYKES
Come on Jared Don’t hide your
sins God sees everything What

Jared stews He really is telling the truth What happened
with Henry was Henry’s sin

JARED

I lied on my Genogram My uncle
Chris wasn’t an alcoholic

Sykes sighs

JARED (CONTD)
It’s true How do you know

SYKES
You want to waste everyone’s time
JARED SYKES (CONTD)

I’m not And mock everyone who has got
up here being honest and
brave

JARED

I could make something up Is that
what you want me to do Isn’t that
a sin too

He eyeballs Sykes A new strength of defiance
JARED (CONTD)
If thoughts are a sin I ask God’s
forgiveness for that but I’m not
making anything up
On Sykes He eyes Jared It seems like a stand off

SYKES
Okay then

He moves off to get the lie chair He sets it down in front
of Jared And places another chair beside Jared

SYKES 0OS
There’s your father Sit down

Jared sits albeit reluctantly
SYKES

me and he’s let me down but -

JARED

Why do I have to be angry
SYKES

Sit down Jared Sit
JARED

I’m not a dog

(beat)
And I don’t think anyone is
responsible for me So -

Jared continues to hold his ground

JARED (CONTD)

I don’t see how it’s going to help

Picking someone to blame or hate

Pretending we’re angry at someone
(to Aaron)

Can you stop filming me -

Aaron tracking him does not stop filming

JARED (CONTD)
I don’t hate anyone

SYKES
Then why all this anger -

JARED
Because you are making me angry

SYKES

SYKES

JARED

Tina’s jaw is wide open Gary smirks Cameron is raising his
eyebrows

Jared moves a few steps toward the door

SYKES
Where are you going You’re not
going anywhere until --

JARED
Youre in my chair There you go I
hate you But how does that help

Jared is starting to breath heavily Panic

JARED (CONTD)
I really want to go

SYKES
Just take a minute

JARED
I mean how does any of this help
It’s crazy
And he walks out

EXT LIA HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
The office door is locked He knocks Panic rising

Sykes comes from the main auditorium He is oscillating
between tender and hard tactics Tender it is -

SYKES

A FEMALE CLERK opens the door Jared moves past

JARED
I want my things

SYKES
Well get your things just come
back and have a talk with me first

JARED
I want my things now And I want -

Jared just walks around and opens a drawer and finds various
bags of people’s belongings At one stage Michael rushes in
and tries to intervene and Jared scuffles with him

Finally Jared finds his bag and grabs his cell phone from
it He leaves the room -

INT LIA HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Sykes blocks his way to the exit Jared retreats

INT LIA MEN’S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Jared storms into the bathroom and finds a stall and locks
himself in His breath is short now Panicked

JARED
(on the phone)
Mom It’s me I need your help

He waits For a long time there is silence Then voices on

Jared is scared now Shit He has to get out He prepares
himself and then storms out past Sykes back into --

INT LIA HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Jareds way to the exit is blocked by Brandon and Aaron
Behind Jared are the other group members all too scared to
help or comment in any way It’s a stand off staff on one
side blocking the exit Clients on the other side

JARED
I wanna leave okay Please

SYKES
You are just having a rough moment

JARED
‘A moment’ A moment

SYKES JARED (CONTD)
Steady on I know it feels - I don’t wanna talk I wanna
go
SYKES JARED (CONTD)
I don’t want you to I read the rules and none of
them say you can stop me from
leaving

Sykes turns to Brandon Mutters something It’s certain he is
asking Brandon to use his muscle to contain Jared

JARED (CONTD)
And if you or anyone puts their
hands on me I have witnesses
(phone rings)
Mom Where are you If I put him on
they might take the phone
(listens )
How far away

Heavy screeching outside and a minor collision Then a door
slam and -

NANCY
Jared

NANCY (CONTD)

Heavy POUNDING comes from the other side of the exit door

NANCY OS
(breathless and LOUD)
JARED Honey What’s happening

JARED
Mom They won’t let me out

NANCY OS
What Why Who’s there with you

Sykes walks toward the door Jared tries to too but Brandon
blocks his way

SYKES
Jared is having a moment born out
of a role-play task He thinks he
wants to go because it brought up
some issues for him but I think
it’s best for his development that
he doesn’t --

JARED
No That’s not Mom Tell him he
has to open the door

SYKES
Ill call Mr Eamons and you and I
and Jared can all sit down to --

NANCY OS
Who exactly am I speaking to

SYKES
This is Victor Sykes We spoke on
the phone a few weeks back
(beat)
Missus Eamons I think the thing to
understand here --

NANCY OS
Open the door Mr Sykes Now
Before I call the police

Hold Jared waits Sykes remains unmoved

Then Cameron steps forward

CAMERON
Open the door
102A

It’s a HUGE moment Cameron rebelling He moves forward and -

Puts his MASSIVE FRAME between Brandon and Jared challenging
the tough guy who once belittled him

CAMERON (CONTD)
He wants to leave

Hold Brandon stands his ground But then something shifts
He knows in this moment he is the weaker of the two men

NANCY OS
Jared

CAMERON
Come on

JARED

We’re coming
Cameron escorts Jared all the way to the exit door

Sykes too steps aside having been overpowered by forces on
both sides allowing Cameron to open the door

The reveal of Nancy is AMAZING She wears sweats and no make-
up or jewelry This is what Nancy looks like when she doesn’t
have to present The real her Naturally beautiful

Jared shakes Cameron’s hand and then hugs him tight Thanks
He eyeballs Sykes ‘You got a problem with this’

Now Jared joins Nancy as they start to move for the door
Then she turns sharply -

NANCY OS
What actual qualifications do you
have Mr Sykes I never asked

Hold Great question It hangs

NANCY
Are you a doctor A psychologist A
real proper one

Nothing --
NANCY OS
Just as I thought Shame on you

Shame on you

It’s true No disputing it Nancy and Jared continue to exit

EXT LIA HEADQUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER
Jared and Nancy walk fast from the door to the car

NANCY
They following

JARED
No
NANCY
Don’t look at me I’m a mess

(beat)
You said hurry

They get in the car And they drive away as fast as Nancy
will drive Maybe one spin of the tires

Music starts -

INT THE PEABODY HOTEL MEMPHIS - EARLY EVENING

Jared sits alone in the affluent green and cream dining hall
of the famous hotel It is early and almost empty

WAITER
Can I help you

JARED
I’m not sure if I’m staying or
going

Then Nancy arrives Jared waits expectantly She is done up
again now albeit a conservative version of herself

NANCY
Your father wants you to go back

Hold We can see Jared’s crest fall Nancy sits

NANCY (CONT’D)
I told him we’ll see him at
home I told him you are not going
back

(beat)

That night Pastor Wilkes and Jim
came to the house

(MORE)
NANCY (CONTD)
Those men decided what to do with
you and I just fell into line like
I usually do Sometimes they say
you gotta hurt a child in order to
help them

(MORE )

104A

NANCY (CONTD)

And that may be so with some
things but a mother knows when
something isn’t right and I knew
in my bones it wasn’t hurting to
help I was just letting you down
and I kept my mouth shut I’11
always regret that

(beat)
So I’m going to do a different
thing now I have a chance I’1l1
handle your father He can fall
into line with me for a change

Jared allows his mother’s embrace Now she lifts the mood

NANCY (CONTD)
I bet this hotel is “off limits”
Out of the “safe zone”

He smiles at her use of the LIA jargon

NANCY (CONTD)
We may as well have a drink
(small laugh)
One of my ideas one of my many
ideas that I know would have made
a lot of money ‘Ministers Wives
Gone Wild’

She gets up heroically not an ounce of fear and turns as if
the brave should follow the brave - ‘come on’

NANCY (CONT’D)
Let’s go to the bar

Jared smiles and stands buoyed by her support

INT EAMONS FAMILY HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Jared and his mother and father eat

Given what’s happened you would think that there would be
much discussion Instead there is none Maybe it’s already

been had Maybe it is to come Or maybe not

Finally Marshall takes his plate and leaves Nancy and Jared
share a look and she keeps eating unperturbed

Music continues

INT JARED’S ROOMEAMONS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jared sits on his bed He unzips his LIA bag He raises
his white shirt Throws it in the trash Behind him now as he
unpacks we hear a doorbell ring He turns to register it but
doesn’t pay too much mind Moments later he hears a knock at
his door

NANCY
(knocking)
Honey
Jared turns -
NANCY (CONT’D)
Do you know a boy by the name of
Cameron Van Huessen

JARED
Is he here

NANCY
No honey That’s a sheriff He’s
come to ask you some questions
Apparently this Cameron boy killed
himself today

The world drops away And much like Cameron’s fake funeral
we absorb his death in a similar fashion slowly --

-- Jared sits to talk to a young sheriff The sheriff takes
Jareds statement Behind the sheriff -

-- Jared sees him father move away up

-- The Sheriff is seen to the door and the whole family
disperses into separate rooms

- Jared walks into his room He turns and sees his father
watching him Jared closes his door

SNAP TO BLACK

FADE TO BLACK

EXT BROOKLYN STREETS - NIGHT (THREE YEARS LATER)

We follow Jared A black coat If it isn’t apparent it will
be as we take in his profile and then his face full frontal
as he turns the corner that it is a few years later

It’s not so much that he has aged More that he wears a new
confidence that wasn’t apparent before Under his arm he
carries a six pack of craft beer and a bottle of wine He
approaches a building in an industrial area --

Jared puts a phone to his ear An iPhone 1 (It is 2008)

JARED
I left my keys They fixed the
buzzer

He buzzes and is buzzed up We pull sideways to take in - New
York City The vast skyline

OMITTED

INT JARED’S SHARED APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jared and friends share a drink post dinner They are
playing a board game

Improvised scene from which --

We move back to see this action now in BG From a bedroom we
discover is Jareds His phone sits beside his computer and a
stack of papers Perhaps we see certain things in the glow
An article with Jared’s name on it in an open journal
magazine a photo of him and his Mom posted on a board
Another of him and a boyfriend Then as we reach his iPhone
and push in - it lights up and rings faintly The vibration
moves it toward the desks edge until it finally stops
teetering over the lip The glow of the ‘unknown number’
finally goes away

Back with Jared and his friends Unaware of who was calling
him and what it would potentially mean Jared continues
laughing and playing
107A

LATER The kitchen is empty The bottles and dishes can wait
for another day We hear Jared farewell a friend OS

OMITTED

INT JARED’S BROOKLYN BEDROOM - LATER

Jared works Now lit by the screen of his desktop we see
evidence of the writer Jared has become We pick off various
things including a post-it note saying ‘write what you

know ’

Jared types furiously and when an email pings he immediately
switches to his email page an email from - Nancy Eamons
“URGENT -- I WAS RIGHT” How could he not open it -

A news article A BOY WHO LOST HIS ARM HANGING IT OUT OF A
CAR IN IBIZA

Then another PING He sighs she has hooked him again
dragging him from work into a text chat

MOM Are you coming for Thanksgiving

JARED I dont know I can

MOM Your dad would love to see you

JARED Ill come when Dad is away at the convention
Then the phone rings He snatches it up -

JARED
Mom I’m working

Pause Then a PING on the computer - Again it is -
MOM Okay Goodnight
Then who is on the phone
VOICE
Is this Jared Eamons

JARED
Yeah Who’s this

Jared walks out to the fridge in the darkened kitchen to grab
another beer --

VOICE
From LIA a few years ago
108A

He stops Moves back to the bedroom and turns off the music
Now there is utter silence

JARED
Who is this
VOICE
It’s ah It’s Victor Sykes
Hold
SYKES

Before you hang up Please hear me
out I’ve been contacting as many
ex-clients as I can

Jared listens and Sykes’ call drowns out We move behind
Jareds head as he listens and we hear faint traces --

When we come across to Jared’s other side of Jared we hear a
fierce and firm drum snare SNAP

THEN TO BLACK

Then a drum roll rumbles over -

EXT BROOKLYN STREET - DAY

A truck passing reveals Jareds face cautiously standing on
the street keenly watching something He puts his phone to
his ear Another drum beat and we see - the drumming actually
comes from a TEEN BOY right by Jared Jared looks at him for
a moment

Jareds friend one we saw from the night before steps up
FRIEND
He’s in there Well from your
description I think he is
(Jared tenses)
You don’t have to do this you know
And with that Jared moves off
FRIEND (CONTD)
Call if you need back up
INT BROOKLYN CAFE - DAY

Jared pokes his head in He looks around --

Jared turns the bend cautiously and looks around
109A

A man stands -- It is Sykes He looks different A new
haircut A grey goatee Loose clothing Transformed

SYKES
Jared Thanks for this

JARED
How did you get my number

SYKES
I tried the one I had on file

They sit

SYKES (CONT’D)
I’m sorry to jump out of nowhere
and contact you

Sykes seems interminably nervous Not his LIA self He
rummages through a shoulder bag

SYKES (CONTD)
I said I had some things for you

Jared is just watching and waiting Uncomfortable

SYKES (CONTD)
There’s a few things about me you
don’t know And well reading the
article I figured it was about time
I made contact with you
(beat)
Try and make some kind of peace

Sykes finds what he wants to give handing it over The torn
out pages of Jared’s Moleskin from all those years ago

SYKES (CONTD)
I kept everything When I left --

Jared is trying to compute everything

SYKES (CONTD)
I couldn’t recognize it at the time

but they really were are very
good The stories
(beat)
You look well And seem good So --
(beat)

Listen I don’t know where to start

left the ministry and LIA and
well I guess you could say I’ve
turned my back on all of it
110A

On Jared absorbing

Sykes pushes a picture across the table - Jared picks it up
A picture of - Sykes with his arm around a man

Jared feelings welling gets up and heads for the restroom

INT RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jared closes the door And it is here of all places and in
this moment that Jared finally releases emotion His shaking
hands wipe a tear and he tries to suppress it But then -

It’s too much and IT ALL COMES OUT

INT BROOKLYN CAFE - CONTINUOUS
Sykes waits patiently at the table He peruses the menu Then
his phone rings
INT RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS
Jared wipes his eyes and speaks on the phone

INTERCUT WITH Sykes Empathetic he listens Something ironic
in the image of him now facing an empty chair

SYKES
I understand Of course

INT BROOKLYN CAFE - CONTINUOUS

And Marshall continues inside leaving Jared unresolved

INT EAMONS FAMILY HOME KITCHEN - NIGHT

Marshall makes notes for a sermon his bible beside him
Suddenly a newspaper placed down Jared’s article (A few in
fact) Nancy holds Marshalls look She picks up the bible

NANCY

Still will be I meant to run and
make a living from But I know you
got other fish to fry

(beat)
I ran your grandfathers mill like
he wanted until I had the gall to
tell him I didn’t want that

He is still looking around not making eye contact Then --

MARSHALL (CONTD)

I stayed up all night trying to
think of good reasons to convince
you to keep everything to
yourself the book and whatnot
but then I thought that would be
like your grandpa forcing me to run
the mill

Jared listens

MARSHALL (CONTD)
I like to do what I want so who am
I to get in anybody else’s way

He turns to Jared

MARSHALL (CONTD)
The truth is I do want you to do
well and have a good life I know
we don’t agree on a handful of
things And I realize by what’s
happened I’ve set myself up to
lose you I had to ask myself and
God if I was ready for that

(beat)

Your mother said a prayer that she
got comfort from Whether it was
her that needed to change and not
you My prayer didn’t so much
give me comfort I don’t think I am
ready to lose you and so I wanted
to let you know -
