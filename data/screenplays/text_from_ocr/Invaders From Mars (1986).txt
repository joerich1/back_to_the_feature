the glass

Linda gets up and opens the door

LINDA (CONTD)
Mrs McKeltch if youre going to
wait could you please have a seat

looks daggers at Linda -- but moves back several paces
from the door

Jimmys attention now Trusting her more

LINDA (CONTD)
(to Jimmy)

DISSOLVE TO
THE VEIL NEBULA

A red and purple wisp of stars and gas hanging deep in
space

TILT DOWN to a small planetarium device glowing ina
dark room

JIMMY is looking at the constellations projected on his
bedroom ceiling

He turns the planetarium device off
Gets out of bed in his pajamas and goes to the window

He can see the city -- from 10 stories up All the lights
and distant buildings from his apartment

A small telescope stands by the window on a tripod
He uses it to look at the Moon

In the bg we can HEAR CONVERSATION going on in another
room in the apartment

Jimmy climbs back under the blankets and looks out --
through the crack in the door -- at his MOM and DAD in
the next room

JIMMYS POINT OF VIEW

The slightly ajar door offers him a sliver of a view and
MUFFLED CONVERSATION He can SEE his parents having
dinner with a MAN Late-night talk cigar smoke the
CLINK of GLASSES dishes on the table Their conversation

is strange to an 11-year-old ear -- available only in
snatches and bits -- and then not completely understandable
at that

DAD

(muffled voice)
» sounds interesting

Jimmys mother is smiling -- occasionally eats something
from her plate

THE MAN
(gesturing)
» critical great opportunity
George up the ladder arranged
MOM

moving again
Jimmy reacts -- upset -- at the word moving
Jimmys Dad and the Man shake hands
DAD
» all right youre right of
course
Theres more CONVERSATION a CLINK of GLASSES and the
SOUND of CHAIRS SCRAPING A man walking to the door
Hugs and good nights
VOICES
Good night night George

Talk to me from there

The apartment door opens and closes

Quiet

The SOUNDS of his parents coming toward his room passing
in the hall outside

They stop

DADS VOICE

MOMS VOICE

The door opens a bit -- sending a streak of light into
Jimmys darkened room
His Dad looks at him
Jimmys looking back

DAD

JIMMY
Yes

Mom and Dad come in

His Dad sits on the edge of his bed

A gentle loving man

Jimmys frightened of whats coming next

DAD

He pats Jimmy on the head -- hoping hell understand
Jimmy thinks a long thought -- teary

EXTERIOR - SKY - MORNING

Clouds GATHERING

INTERIOR - STATION WAGON - MORNING

Jimmys face pressed to the back window -- watching the
neighborhood disappear

EXTERIOR - INTERSTATE HIGHWAY - MONTAGE

Their CAR on the road
Moving through low foothills
The countryside changing
The sun dropping in the west

Stars coming out

The car traveling at night
A million STARS above

JIMMYS VOICE (VO)
(over)
Like I said we move around a lot
Dads really good at his job and when
they open a new plant they always ask
him to go work at it So I was used
to it But I was sad

INTERIOR - CAR - DAY

Jimmys face pressed against the window
The landscape reflected in the glass
Moving into large mountains A new part of the country

JIMMY
Whats that Dad

DAD

TWO JETS SHRIEK overhead on approach

JIMMY
Wow

Jimmy sees all the trucks and jeeps coming and going
The electric fences and gates Power transformers HUMMING

JIMMY (CONTD)
Are you going to sell power to
them Dad

His Dad laughs

DAD
No son They have their own

Jimmy looks through the fence -- and sees two mysterious
BLACK DOME-LIKE BUILDINGS on the base

JIMMY
What are those Dad

His father looks
DAD

Thats their radar Jimmy It picks
up anything that moves across the sky

Their car moves on
Jimmy looks back at the two black buildinghuts
They WHIRR and CLICK with eerie electro-mechanical SOUNDS

EXTERIOR - THE NEW HOUSE - COUNTRY - LATE AFTERNOON

A little house in a fairly lonely spot

White Colonial two-story Surrounded by trees

At the foot of a large HILL

In the distance the dramatic mountains of Colorado

DAD
(smiles)

JIMMY
Lets check it out Dad

EXTERIOR - HILL - DUSK

Jimmy and his Dad make their way up a twisting path
Through a dense pine forest to the crest of the ridge
An old wooden handrail marks the path and disappears in
the bushes in the valley

From the crest they can see the town in the distance
A lonely lovely spot Breathtaking
Jimmy and his Dad take it all in in the dying light

JIMMY
(pointing)
Wow Theres the town And
theres the air base This is a
great hill

DAD
Its got a name Copper Ridge
There used to be a copper mine
near here

JIMMY
Lets see whats on the other side
Maybe well find some copper

They hike over the top
On the far side of the hill is a big SAND PIT

JIMMY
Wow

Dad steps forward and scoops up some of the sand
Lets it run through his fingers

DAD
Well isnt this something Be
careful if you play here

A CRY from the house breaks the silence

MOMS VOICE
(calling)
George Jimmy

DAD
(draping his arm
around Jimmy)

They turn and head back down the path to the house
A FALLING STAR shoots across the sky

COL WILSON

(nods to Jimmy)
Welcome Im new here myself

Jimmy smiles He likes the Colonel

COL WILSON (CONTD)

(back to the class)
The United States Government
maintains bases in every state and
even in some other countries by
mutual agreement between those
countries and us Grove is part of
the Air Defense Command -- which has
the responsibility of repelling any
aerial attack on the United States
Youve all seen and heard our planes
flying over

(spontaneous jet

sounds from the kids

he smiles)
They protect this city and the
surrounding area out to a distance
of approximately 300 miles In
addition we do research involving
some of the most advanced aircraft
in the world

Jimmy looks around the room -- at the blackboards and
cabinets -- then quickly back to the Colonel Listening
closely to the man

COL WILSON (CONTD)
We have two fighter-interceptor
wings at the base consisting
of four squadrons each of F-15
fighters Each wing has 10 pilots
Some of them are administrators --
just like your teachers and principals
who work in your school There are
maintenance and supply buildings
Parts for planes trucks cars food
storage refrigeration plants
a power plant for electricity fuel
storage cooking facilities mess
halls In other words boys and
girls Grove Air Base is just like
a self-contained little city and
can survive by itself for an extended
period of time

Jimmy is listening to all of this closely

COL WILSON (CONTD)
We are your protection against any
hostile forces that threaten the
peace and security of this school
city or the country Do you have
any questions

LITTLE GIRL
Are there any girl pilots in the
Air Force

COL WILSON
As a matter of fact there are quite
a few now Most of them are attached
to the Military Airlift Command

LITTLE BOY
How do you prevent planes from
sneaking up on you

COL WILSON
We have radar that looks at the sky
day and night Its a brand new
radar called phased array So
nothing can sneak up on us

ANOTHER BOY
Can we come and see the planes
sometime
COL WILSON

I would welcome all of you to visit
You can call me personally and
arrange a school or group visit
almost any time

(looks around)
Well -- boys and girls I hope Ive
answered some of your questions I
hope you have a better idea of what
Grove Air Force Base is doing here
Ive enjoyed talking to you today
and I know youll look at me and
the other airmen on the base as your
friends

Mrs McKeltch nods for the class to show its appreciation
They do -- applauding whistling

EXTERIOR - SCHOOL YARD - LUNCHTIME

Jimmy all by himself on the playground
The other kids not coming over to say hi

Three KIDS come over Two BOYS and a GIRL

BOY
(to Jimmy)

The little GIRL steps forward Teasing

LITTLE GIRL

They turn and run away laughing
Jimmy yells after them

JIMMY

Mrs McKeltch comes over a long ruler in her hand
MRS McKELTCH

The other kids giggle and point at him

DISSOLVE TO

EXTERIOR - JIMMYS HOUSE - EVENING

LONG SHOT of the house under a full moon
A shooting star sizzles across the sky

EXTERIOR - PORCH - EVENING

Jimmy and his Dad sitting out

The long low hills Distant Odd Dark

The scrub pines and owls at night Frogs and crickets
and whippoorwills

A big moon hanging over the top O£ the trees

A magic night

The Milky Way a band of stars across the sky

DAD
(pointing out)
There goes another one That
was a bright one

They watch a meteor arc glowing across the sky
Jimmy looks -- and nods

The SOUND of CRICKETS and the silent fall of meteors
in a late summer evening
Jimmys eyes see everything

JIMMY
There Dad -- look

His father nods at the next one
Theyre coming in heavily now -- one every ten or
fifteen seconds

JIMMY (CONTD)
There are more this year than last

DAD
This should be the heaviest shower

JIMMY (CONTD)

DAD

They look up at it
The two lean back and watch as meteorites continue to fall
Mom comes out quietly

Watches too
She looks at them

MOM

JIMMY
Mom -- this is the best show all
year

MOM

Dad nods

DAD
Five minutes more

Mom gives up
She watches a little while longer and goes back inside

The screen door slams shut
LONG SHOT - JIMMY AND HIS DAD ON THE PORCH

They watch a few minutes more

The sky seems immense above the trees
Dark and clear

Here and there a cloud coming up

DAD
Well son Should we call it a
night I for one have had a long
day

JIMMY
(reluctantly)
Okay
INTERIOR - JIMMYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

His father turns at the door

DAD
Goodnight -- sleep well Dream a
nice one for me

Jimmy nods lying under the blankets

JIMMY
You too Dad

The door to his room closes

Dark

Moonlit

Jimmy pushes the covers back and goes to the window
His small TELESCOPE waiting for him

Sitting on the sill lit by the moon

Jimmy tries looking through it at the meteorites
Theyre hard to find

He goes back to watching with his unaided eyes

Tired eyes sleepy he crawls back to bed
Gets under the covers

Settles in

His eyes close -- and he goes to sleep

EXTERIOR - SKY - NIGHT

Heavy CLOUDS begin to move across the moon
A storm coming in
THUNDER and lightning heavy rain

INTERIOR - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jimmys tossing and turning
Dreaming

DREAM IMAGES

of leaving the city whirls of color the trees along the
ridge -- blowing RAIN -- the hostile faces of the kids at
school -- Mrs McKeltchs face --

The CRASH of THUNDER and HOWLING

Jimmy WAKES UP with a start Bolt awake

A terrible storm is raging outside

His window open

Rain blowing in

He looks at the alarm clock on the night table

440 AM

He runs to the window
The trees are lashed with wind and rain

Water running down the panes of his window
Blowing through the open screen

Jimmy tries to close the window -- pull it down
Its stuck He puts his weight into it

Suddenly the rain comes to a dead STOP

Like the eye of a hurricane

Its eerie Not a sound outside

Just the wet lawn and the water dripping from trees

A moment passes -- a heartbeat -- and then --

A HORRIBLE SOUND comes from the sky
A throbbing ululation
Massive Terrifying

A HUGE LIGHT drops down through the clouds

It breaks through the cloud layer and descends toward the Earth
An OBJECT -- ENORMOUS METALLIC GLOWING

CHANGING SHAPE as it falls

First a sphere

Then flattening out into a disc

Expanding to a bottle-shape

Elongating to a spear and dropping down behind the HILL

The hill with the sand pit

The light dies and the SOUND ceases

As Jimmy stands in the window open-mouthed still clutching
the sill the RAIN and LIGHTNING start up again
With a howl of wind and rain blowing in his face

Shaken wild-eyed Jimmy runs for his parents room

INTERIOR - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Tearing down the hall
Jimmy barges into his parents bedroom

INTERIOR - BEDROOM - NIGHT

JIMMY
Dad Mom

His parents -- still asleep
They sit up suddenly

DAD
Jim -- whats wrong

JIMMY
(screaming)
Youve got to come see -- a big
thing went down over the hill

INTERIOR - JIMMYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

They -- all three -- look out the window
The rain is abating again but more naturally gradually
Water running off the roof of the house

Nothing is visible beyond the hill
It looks normal
Dark but for the occasional flicker of sheet lightning

JIMMY
It was big -- and it glowed -- and
it went down over there -- behind
the hill

DAD

What did it look like

JIMMY
It was -- it was -- it changed shape
First it was big and round then it
was flat then it was long and thin

Dad and Mom give him a funny look

DAD
Are you sure you saw that In the
rain -- it may have looked like it
changed shape --
JIMMY
(unhappy)

I dont know Dad But it was big

DAD
Ill go take a look when the rain
lets off
MOM
(to Dad)

What do you think he saw Could
it have been something from the
air base

JIMMY
No Mom It wasnt a plane

His father looks concerned -- and interested
DAD
You go back to sleep Ill look
when its light

They wait for Jimmy to climb back into bed
They close the door

Jimmy looks at the top of the ridge from his bed
Hard to see anything in the dark
DISSOLVE TO

INTERIOR - JIMMY S BEDROOM - MORNING

Jimmy wakes up

Early morning sunlight on his face

He jumps up runs to the window

The hill looks clean and bright in the morning light

Jimmy aims his telescope at the top of the hill

HIS POV - THROUGH THE TELESCOPE

This enlarged VIEW of the crest of the hill suddenly
affords us a startling view of DAD coming toward the
house -- from the far side of the hill

Jimmy dashes out the door

EXTERIOR - BACK PORCH - MORNING

Jimmy looks a little worried for his Dad
Sees him coming out from behind some trees

JIMMY
Did you see anything Dad

Dad says nothing -- keeps coming

His bathrobe is a little mussed

He looks all right -- but not all right

He seems a little cold -- or maybe just tired

JIMMY (CONTD)
Are you all right Dad

DAD
(brightens a bit)
Sure fine
Dad walks by him
As he does -- Jimmy sees that hes missing a SLIPPER

INTERIOR - KITCHEN - MORNING

Mom making breakfast greets him a hug

MOM
George where have you been

JIMMY
What happened to your other slipper

Mom looks now too
DAD

I lost it
(smiles a little
sheepishly)
Its kind of muddy out there

JIMMY
Was there anything over the hill

Both Jimmy and his Mom are interested now

Dad looks at his son Smiles
Taps him affectionately on the head

DAD
Nothing I could see son It was
a bad dream is all

He walks over to get some coffee in his bathrobe
Jimmy follows him with a look

His father rubs the back of his neck

Picks up a cup of coffee -- and sits down at the table

Jimmy SEES a SCRATCH MARK -- BLOODY -- ON THE BACK OF DADS NECK
But he doesnt get a good look at it Its a half-glimpse
Jimmy tries to get another look

He does as the Father sits down

Looking directly at it A strange bloody SPOT above his
Dads collar

JIMMY
(slightly alarmed)
What happened to your neck Dad

Dad reaches back touches the spot Immediately
Passes it off --

DAD
A branch must have nicked me
(smiling sips
his coffee)

His bathrobe collar now covers his neck Mom -- busy
getting breakfast -- misses the exchange

DAD (CONTD)
(changing the subject)
How are you today son

Before Jimmy can answer his Dad gets up and goes over

to the refrigerator

He pops open the door -- looks around inside -- and takes
out some luncheon meat

Dad comes back to the breakfast table with two thick pieces
of ham

Sets them down on a saucer next to his coffee

MOM
(at the sink)
Your father asked you a question

JIMMY
(startled still
watching Dad)
What -- I
(trails off)

Jimmy watches as his Dad pours several teaspoons of sugar

into his coffee -- then continues pouring SUGAR ONTO THE
HAM SLICES until theyre covered white

Jimmy stares -- hes never seen --

Dad smiles at him -- and POPS the sugar-covered ham into

his mouth
Mom turns around from the counter and sets their breakfast
on the table

MOM
Both of you eat this before it gets
cold

Dad digs right in to the cereal and eggs Moms fixed
Jimmy doesnt seem interested in eating

MOM (CONTD)
I have to go over to the town this
morning and do a lot of shopping
This house needs just everything
Ill probably be gone all day
Jimmy hurry up and eat or youll
be late

DAD
Ill take you to school

MOM
You dont have to The school bus

Ive got to run

Mom leaves them and goes upstairs to get her keys
Dad finishes his coffee
Its 700

Mom comes down kisses Jimmy and goes out to the car
Jimmy looks at the clock 703

Jimmy goes to the window and watches his Mom go to the used
STATION WAGON theyve just bought as a second car

She gets in and turns the ignition key

The car GRINDS -- and doesnt start

She tries again -- nothing

MOM
(calls in to Dad)
George the car wont start
Dad takes another sip of his sugared coffee and gets up

EXTERIOR - THE DRIVEWAY - MORNING

Dad and Jimmy come out

MOM
(to Dad)
Thats strange I had a dream
last night where the car wouldnt
start Isnt that funny

Dad pops open the hood Fiddles

DAD
Try it again

Mom in the car turns the key
It starts Mom looks relieved

Jimmy looks on Dad wipes off his hands
DAD (CONTD)
Its probably the solenoid Take it
back to Gleasons they said theyd
fix it if we found anything wrong
MOM
Iwill But isnt that odd -- about
my dream

He slams the hood and starts back inside

DAD
See you later

She waves to both of them and drives down the driveway
They watch her drive away

INTERIOR - KITCHEN - STILL MORNING

Jimmy and his Dad alone

They sit across the table from each other
Looking at each other

Dad says nothing Expressionless
Unblinking

A CLOCK TICKS loudly

Jimmys starting to get scared

DAD
Let me walk you to the bus stop

EXTERIOR - THE ROAD - MORNING

The two walk down the driveway to the road
Jimmys upset
Somethings wrong with his Dad and he doesnt know what
Dad looks down at him An odd smile
DAD
You know something son You were
right There is something over

the hill

Jimmy looks shocked

JIMMY
What
His Dad looks back -- at the hill behind the house
DAD

Come on Ill show you

Jimmy suddenly doesnt want to see it
Dad reaches out -- still smiling -- to take him by the hand
Jimmys suddenly frightened

JIMMY
(shrinking back)
No Dad

Dad grabs Jimmys hand and starts dragging him toward the
hill

JIMMY (CONTD)
(struggling)
No

Jimmys crying He tears free from his old mans grasp
Dad steps toward him
Jimmy takes a step back

At that moment they HEAR a loud HONKING
Jimmy looks and sees the SCHOOL BUS rounding the bend

Books in hand he runs for the bus

INTERIOR - BUS - MORNING

Jimmy sits alone At the back Near tears

He looks out the rear window as the bus pulls away

The last image -- his Dad standing at the side of the road --
waving goodbye

INTERIOR - SCHOOL - HALL - MORNING

Jimmy walking down the hall toward room 101

A KID -- JUMPS out at him -- BOO -- from around the
corner

Jimmy nearly goes through the ceiling

The two KID jokesters run off laughing
EXTERIOR - NUCLEAR POWER PLANTGRID

CUT TO

CONTROL STATION - MORNING

Dad (George Gardner) is being shown
location Dad is a striking figure

The SUPERVISOR points to two large

around his new job
in his dark suit

domed buildings as

they walk

SUPERVISOR
Those are twin reactors Sodium
cooled cores Best damn design in
the whole country Never worry a
minute about them

He smiles and continues on showing the facility to George
They go into a low building adjacent to the reactors

INTERIOR - POWER SWITCHING AND CONTROL GRID - MORNING

The Supervisor takes George into a large room with an
immense GRAPHICS BOARD showing the electrical GRID networks
for the Western United States

In front of the displays are control consoles with men
at them -- much like Houston Control

SUPERVISOR
(to George)
There it is We know exactly how
much extra juice we can throw into
the network just by checking the
reactors

George scopes it out carefully

They walk over to desk 1 The man at the desk LARRY
stands up and shakes hands with George

SUPERVISOR (CONTD)
Larry -- George Gardner I was just
showing George around Hes our new
whiz kid -- trouble shooter Hes
gonna be your new supervisor

(NOTE This scene is shot from a series of ANGLES
which convey the impression of it being seen through
the eyes of a child Adults are tall -- and seen at
tilted angles -- conversations are somewhat cryptic --
equipment looks foreign and unfamiliar )

SUPERVISOR (CONTD)
(to Larry)
George tells me hes programmed a
crisis into our simulation tape
He wants to see how we do

LARRY
(to George)
Flick that switch

Jimmys Dad does Looks at the board

LARRY (CONTD)
(to George)
Youve just taken control of all
the electric power in the western
sector of the United States Youve
run one of these before Go ahead

Jimmys Dad (George) welcomes the opportunity His eyes
race up and down the control panels

On the Graphic Board we can SEE a power CRISIS unfold
The flow of current (colored representation) starts to
surge in Colorado

George punches some buttons and diverts some power

Larry and the other Man stand by and watch

A bigger crisis rolls over the board ALARMS SOUNDING
Power draining from the system

A BLACKOUT beginning

George starts taking counter-measures

GEORGE
Theres the transient I programmed
(punching buttons
the crisis worsens)

» Okay -- were losing Colorado
Nevada Utah Its going to
crash the whole system

There it goes --

The other two men stand by smiling

Suddenly the situation starts to reverse itself -- without
Georges efforts
The collapse -- and rolling blackout -- starts to limit
itself -- small pockets browning out -- the main system
intact

LARRY

See The systems self-limiting
the problem Its cutting off
power in cells to preserve the
entire network

Georges eyes race across the board -- studying just how
its doing that Eagerly taking it all in

GEORGE
And how does it do that

LARRY
Its designed to We just put it
in As long as the ADPs are
functioning theyll always save the
total network Faster than any
human response

GEORGE
What if the ADPs fail

The Supervisor smiles So does Larry

SUPERVISOR
Thats highly unlikely

LARRY
Unit 2 over there --
(he means the nuclear
power plant next door)
-- isnt counted on the grid If
its needed it kicks in and gives
us a 12 safety margin

George is impressed He didnt know that But hes a
pessimist

GEORGE
And if that doesnt do it

SUPERVISOR
(shrugs)
Oh -- well -- in that case youd
have a catastrophic failure Wed
lose the whole thing -- vapor lock
it so to speak and not be able to
start it up again for hours

A fold-down anatomical chart and a chalk sketch

Jimmy looks at the wall clock

An Air Force fighter JET is making low passes in the distance
Back and forth over the hills

The two Cops nod to Mom

Jimmy looks quickly in the dark

Just a flash as one goes by -- but it looks like

As they get into their car Officer Keneny touches the

INTERIOR - JIMMYS ROOM - NIGHT

Jimmy lies in bed The blankets pulled up to his chin
LISTENING intently to the SOUNDS of dishes CLATTERING
pots and pans in the kitchen -- downstairs

His parents finishing up

Every fiber of his being -- straining
As long as he HEARS them theyre safe -- inside

Suddenly the sounds -- grow less
Then -- stop
Silence from the kitchen
Jimmys heart skips

He gets up -- goes to the bedroom door
Opens it -- looks downstairs Listens
No one downstairs

He runs to the window

SEES his Mom and Dad walking up the path to the ridge
His heart sinks

Dad escorting Mom

Jimmy aches to cry out -- do something
Theres nothing he can do -- but watch Theyre getting
smaller He goes to his TELESCOPE on the window sill

JIMMYS POINT OF VIEW - THROUGH THE TELESCOPE

His Mom and Dad talking at the top of the ridge
They disappear over it
Gone

Jimmy looks back out at the hill with his naked eye
Jimmy waits -- watching

Eyes never leaving the crest of the hill

His heart pounding Waiting

He rests his head on his arms on the sill Crying
The bedside alarm clock says 1010

Jimmy forgets to say anything
Just stares at his food -- afraid to look at Dad

Mom goes to the refrigerator rummages through and
finds some RAW HAMBURGER
As Jimmy WATCHES

She scoops out a small mound with her hand -- grabs a
SALT shaker and pours enough SALT on the raw meat to
cake it WHITE

Mom without hesitating puts it in her mouth -- chewing
it casually -- absentmindedly

Jimmy STARES

Mom finishes swallowing and closes the refrigerator door

She washes her fingers off at the sink and comes over
to them

MOM

Jimmys heart leaps
She believes him He loves Ms Magnuson

Jimmy opens the window -- and lowers himself out

EXTERIOR - SCHOOL BUILDING - DAY

Jimmy drops down from the window -- behind some low bushes
and a tree outside the window

Free -- he takes in some breaths of clean fresh air
Looks both ways to see no ones around and starts
across the school grounds toward the gate

Sneaking out to the gate now Jimmy hugs the building
The grounds deserted -- all the other kids back in class

Suddenly Jimmy SEES his PARENTS CAR coming down the road

Jimmy presses close to the wall -- and watches as his
parents car parks in the visitors parking lot

Then he starts to run -- through the teachers parking lot
Jimmys almost around a van -- when he sees Mr Cross the
Principal coming toward him headed for his car

Nowhere to go -- Mr Cross is going to see him any second

The door on the van hes hiding behind stands open
Jimmy hops in -- just before Mr Cross turns the corner

INTERIOR - VAN - DAY

Jimmy can HEAR Mr Cross go by

MR CROSSS VOICE
Good afternoon Mrs McKeltch

Jimmy freezes --

Just as he leans forward to climb out of the van -- someone
outside touches the sliding van door and SLAMS it shut
Jimmys trapped

He scrunches down behind the jump seats The front door
opens and someone gets in

MRS McCKELTCH His heart stops
She doesnt see Jimmy She starts the van and pulls out
of the lot

They start driving -- Jimmy stowed away unseen

INTERIOR - VAN - DRIVING

Mrs McKeltch drives along the highway -- then a country
road

Jimmy sneaking peeks at her from in back -- can SEE the

Driving into the woods

window
He sees Mrs McKeltch walking away through the woods toward
a HILLSIDE

Jimmy continues to watch as Mrs McKeltch stops before some
sort of TUNNEL

She goes in

EXTERIOR - FOREST - DAY

Jimmy lets himself out of the van and follows
along the path Mrs McKeltch took

He comes to the mouth of the TUNNEL

Eight feet high

Jimmy can HEAR Mrs McKetlch WALKING down the
tunnels length

He follows her

INTERIOR - TUNNEL - DAY

The SOUND of Mrs McKeltchs FOOTSTEPS in the tunnel

Jimmy looks at the tunnel walls Theyre frozen BUBBLES
of some kind -- as if the tunnel was formed by melting
Following Jimmy notices that its not getting any

darker Theres a light -- red colored -- up ahead
Hugging the wall hiding behind rocks Jimmy follows
Ahead he hears Mrs McKeltchs footsteps come to a

HALT

He PEEKS around the corner and SEES
Mrs McKeltch standing in the half-red light --

met by TWO 7 FOOT HIGH CREATURES
Part MACHINE part FLESH --

Their arm and leg appendages -- metal

Their mid-section -- electro-mechanical

Their HEADS -- large box-like things -- with something
inside -- floating in liquid and visible through a
window

The thing inside is BRAIN-LIKE A small STRUCTURE

constantly changing -- forming and re-forming itself
Delicate TENDRILS grow out from the edges and an EYE
of sorts floats over the surface of the brain-flesh

They escort Mrs McKeltch through a rectangular door
in the tunnel Jimmy waits till they clear -- then
sneaks up

INTERIOR - TUNNEL DOOR - DAY

Jimmy sneaks up to the door he saw Mrs McKeltch disappear

through Its machined reddish metal and plastic -- set
flush with the tunnel The door itself is a door set in
the side of some larger object -- a ship

Jimmy listens at the door From inside he hears a heavy
RUMBLING Jimmy hesitates a moment -- steeling himself --
then goes in
INTERIOR - SHIP - DAY

A bronzegreen light on the machined walls

Cold austere and no one around

The ship appears to be built -- inside -- in the
form of a SPIRAL -- like a sea shell --

long curving ramps and translucent bronze walls

The only corridor leads -- down -- to a small ROOM
Through the semi-transparent WALL Jimmy can SEE
into the ROOM

INTERIOR - ROOM - DAY

Mrs McKeltch is standing before a CONSOLE -- or
ALTAR

The 7 Cyborgs stand on either side of her like
two escorts

LOW LOOMING ANGLES of Mrs McKeltch -- waiting in front
of the altar As Jimmy watches two heavy metal
SHUTTERS slide open to reveal --

The SUPREME INTELLIGENCE

The same sort of brain tissue as in the Cyborgs --

but LARGER and more active Swimming in a perfect
glass sphere -- the brain has the IMPRESSION of a

FACE on it Slitted eyes with heavy lids no mouth --
the brain-face is capable of registering RAGE cool
ALARM irritation and lightning THOUGHT that is
transmitted to its agents

Mrs McKeltch appears drugged -- mechanically responsive
to this controlling thing As Jimmy watches --
it TESTS her

Like checking out a circuit board -- Mrs McKeltch
responds to slight movements of the eye in the box
She raises one arm -- then another

Looks left -- looks right

Opens her mouth

MRS McKELTCH
(speaks vowels)
Aa Oh Ee Oo

A pause -- a SILENCE settles over the ship

Jimmy feels it -- and interruption in the exchange between
Mrs McKeltch and the INTELLIGENCE The eye in the thing
on the altar starts to move about -- RAPIDLY -- as if
searching the area for something Jimmy ducks down

Jimmy freezes Looks back at the open door in the ship
Two CYBORGS begin moving toward the open door
Mrs McKeltch starts RUNNING in Jimmys direction
Jimmy runs -- underneath the grasp of a Cyborg --
out of the ship -- and down the tunnel

Running faster than hes ever run in his life

INTERIOR - TUNNEL - DAY

Jimmy running -- can SEE the light ahead at the end
of the tunnel --

EXTERIOR - FOREST - HILLSIDE - DAY

Jimmy comes bursting out of the tunnel opening
He marks its location in his mind with reference points

Two nearby trees -- a large rock outcropping --
and then continues RUNNING Down the hillside --
through the forest -- Trying to orient himself as he runs

He stops and sees his house a quarter of a mile to the left
The tunnel opening is in the same ridge that runs in back
of his house To the right should be the road leading to
Linda Magnusons house He stops and hides behind a bush
taking a breather and checks the map Linda drew for him

Lindas house is just a half mile down the road from his
He reaches the road and starts running for Lindas

EXTERIOR - ROAD - AFTERNOON

Jimmy can see Lindas house up ahead Her car in the
driveway Jimmy runs around to the side of her house
Looks in the window Sees Linda -- alone -- in the house
He runs to the back door and pounds on it Linda opens it

JIMMY
Ms Magnuson Ms Magnuson I
found them -- theyre down in the

tunnels
Linda tries to calm him down

LINDA
Jimmy calm down What happened
Tell me what happened

JIMMY
(nearly incoherent)
I got trapped in Mrs McKeltchs
van -- and she went to the tunnel
and went down there with them --
behind my house I saw them

LINDA
Where Jimmy

JIMMY
Behind my house up on the ridge
LINDA
If we go and look and theres
nothing there youll have to admit
to me that this is all in your mind

Jimmy catches his breath then nods

JIMMY
Yes
EXTERIOR - ROAD - AFTERNOON
Linda parks her car out of sight -- off the road at a

spot Jimmy shows her They get out and start toward
the top of the ridge Jimmy leading the way cautiously
Jimmy sees the two large trees the rock outcropping

JIMMY
This is the spot

Linda looks around for something -- anything Theres
nothing No tunnel opening No sign of anything wrong
Jimmy looks too Disturbed

JIMMY (CONTD)
This is where it was -- the tunnel
opening

LINDA
(gently but firmly)
I dont see anything

JIMMY
No but it was here

He goes over as she watches and feels the side of the hill
Solid and undisturbed Grass growing out of where the
tunnel opening has to be

JIMMY (CONTD)
It isnt here Its gone

Linda looks at him skeptically

JIMMY (CONTD)
I swear it was here

LINDA
But its not Jimmy

JIMMY
No

LINDA
Lets go look at the sand pit
behind your house
The mention of the place produces a feeling of dread in
Jimmy

JIMMY
Theyll get us

LINDA
Well be very careful But we
have to see
(she studies Jimmy)
If something landed there there
would be a big scar in the ground
Wouldnt there

Jimmy nods

LINDA (CONTD)
Lets go

EXTERIOR - HILL - LATE AFTERNOON

Jimmy and Nurse Magnuson are climbing toward the crest --
along a different path than the one leading from Jimmys
back yard

JIMMY
(whispers)
Be careful Please be careful

Linda nods Her face serious and alert glancing around

EXTERIOR - CREST OF HILL - NEAR SUNSET

Jimmys heart is in his mouth
Down below they can see his house
Looking the other way -- THE PIT

It lies before them -- undisturbed
The sand smooth and white

LINDA
(holds his hand)
Does it look to you like anything
landed here

JIMMY
(looking around)
Maybe -- it landed in the bushes

Two figures against the orange sky A wind blowing
Big fleecy clouds in the sky

LINDA
(kindly)
Jimmy -- were already in trouble
both of us because of me helping
you run away Now I can make up

a story that will smooth things over
Your house is right down there Why
dont you let me take you home and
tell your parents something that will
make them not be mad at us

He looks up at her Holding her hand
Shes still in her white nurses uniform -- beautiful
Every young boys vision of a protector

Jimmy looks down at his house

At that moment a blue AIR FORCE PICKUP pulls up in front
of Jimmys house

He gasps and jerks his head down

He and Linda peek through the bushes

As they watch TWO AIR FORCE MEN go and knock at the
front door of the house

The door is opened by Dad

He talks with them awhile -- then POINTS up the hill --
seemingly directed at Jimmy and Linda which makes them
duck back down

The AIR FORCE MEN start up the hill
They have some sort of detector with them that Jimmy can see
They sweep the ground as they walk
Closer now to the crest of the hill

As Jimmy and Linda watch the two Air Force MEN reach the
crest of the hill -- and go down to the sand PIT
50 yards across

Their instrument-counters perhaps registering something
They fan out -- walking out onto the sand
Their backs to each other

Jimmy -- watching -- is almost afraid to breathe

Suddenly -- as Jimmy and Linda look on --

the GROUND OPENS UP beneath one of the men

A VORTEX OF SAND under his feet --

PULLING him -- swiftly and wordlessly -- DOWN
GONE under the sand

The OTHER MAN -- hears the gasp

Turns swiftly --

gets the same surprised look on his face

He is SUCKED DOWN

Both gone now

The sand SMOOTHS OVER as though it had never been
disturbed

Linda and Jimmy look at each other

Jimmy and Linda -- RUN for the car
INTERIOR - LINDAS CAR - SUNSET

Linda tries to start the engine

It has trouble catching

She grinds the engine -- it falters

Panicked now -- she pumps the gas pedal

Cranks the car -- it wont go

Nearly hysterical -- she pounds the steering wheel
Jimmy watches

Still the car wont go

Suddenly they see the Air Force PICKUP coming down the road
Jimmy and Linda freeze

EXTERIOR - ROAD - DUSK

The AIR FORCE PICKUP -- with the TWO MEN in the front seat --
looking as if nothings happened -- drives by

No sign from the men that anythings wrong
The pickup goes around the curve in the road
Jimmy and Linda look at each other
CUT TO

INTERIOR - COLONELS OFFICE - NIGHT

LINDA
Afterwards the two Air Force men
came back in their truck They
drove by us like nothing had happened
Now theyre on the base I saw them

Jimmy nods
Its all true
Wilson looks at Sgt Rinaldi

SGT RINALDI
(to Col Wilson)
That would be Hollis and Johnson
They were assigned to ground
search in this area

CUT BACK TO

EXTERIOR - ROAD - DUSK

Linda tries the car again
Now it roars to life
Linda gets it back on the road and drives away quickly

JIMMY
What are we going to do now

Lindas silent -- thinking She turns down several roads --
arriving at some streets in a residential neighborhood
outside town

JIMMY (CONTD)
Where are we going

Linda gets to the corner -- about to turn onto the street

They see a POLICE CAR parked in front of her house
Waiting

JIMMY (CONTD)
No no The cops are with them

Linda drives through the intersection -- and keeps going

EXTERIOR - MARKET PARKING LOT - TOWN - EVENING

Linda pulls into a full parking lot -- finds a place
LINDA
Stay here Im going to make a
phone call
JIMMY

Who are you calling

LINDA
The State Police

Linda gets out and walks toward a Public Telephone
behind the market

Jimmy slinks down onto the front seat out of sight

INTERIOR - PUBLIC TELEPHONE - NIGHT

Linda drops in 20c and dials 411

LINDA

(into phone)
Yes Id like the number of the

the phone book)

INTERIOR - LINDAS CAR - NIGHT

Jimmys looking up -- through the open window at
MRS McKELTCH

MRS McKELTCH
(staring at him --
hard)
There you are Everyones looking
for you

Panicked Jimmy slides across the front seat -- and jumps
out of the car from the drivers side

Runs away

Mrs McKeltch trying to follow him

MRS McKELTCH (CONTD)

Wait
Jimmy runs into an alley -- off Main Street
Jimmys a fugitive in the small town
He darts out of the alley -- onto Main Street

EXTERIOR - MAIN STREET - JUST DARK

Jimmy slinks along the sidewalk like a criminal
Looking for a place to duck into
Nothings open in this part of the block

Suddenly up ahead he sees a COP

Walking in his direction

Jimmy freezes -- looks back

MRS McKELTCH coming up on him from behind

Suddenly a car pulls up next to him -- a white Ford
The passenger door pops open

LINDA
Get in the car

Jimmy gets in and she pulls away

INTERIOR - CAR - NIGHT

Linda thinking as she drives

JIMMY
Did you call the State Police

LINDA
All their lines were busy

Linda looks bothered by that
Shes driving out of town while trying to think where to go

Up ahead parked under the lights of a filling station
is a POLICE ROADBLOCK
A cop talking to a motorist

Linda turns off onto a side road
LINDA

Theres one place we can hide
while we call the FBI
EXTERIOR - THE SCHOOL - NIGHT

Deserted at this hour
Linda pulls up

LINDA
No one comes here after dark

JIMMY
Hide the car

Linda pulls off the road rolling across the grass and dirt

EXTERIOR - ROADSIDE - NIGHT

Linda parks the car behind some trees and hedges
Not visible from the road

She and Jimmy get out -- and cross the road
Headed for the school

EXTERIOR - SCHOOL BUILDING - NIGHT

Linda unlocks the door and they go in

INTERIOR - SCHOOL BUILDING - NIGHT

Linda unlocks the office Deliberately avoids turning on
lights Jimmy follows her in Hard to see in the dark
office

She goes for the phone

The phones have LOCKS on them

Linda tries to undo the lock No good

LINDA
(frustrated)
Damn

JIMMY
I know a way

He takes the phone from her hand

JIMMY (CONTD)
Whats the number

Linda takes the slip of paper from her purse and gives
it to him

The phone is a dial-type rather than pushbutton
Jimmy positions his index finger carefully over the
cradle button -- and begins TAPPING out the number
TAP TAP TAP - pause - TAP TAP TAP TAP TAP TAP TAP
TAP TAP TAP - pause - TAP TAP TAP - tapping out each
number in the exact rhythm the dial would make

Linda watches amazed
The phone starts RINGING in Jimmys ear
He hands it to Linda

She puts it to her ear

The line on the other end is picked up

VOICE ON PHONE (VO)
All circuits are busy at this time
Please try again later

LINDA
(looks at Jimmy)
Still busy

JIMMY
(remembering)
There was this guy with Dad who
said he worked at the telephone
switching division

Car HEADLIGHTS sweep the parking lot
The CRUNCH of gravel outside

Linda looks out the window

A cop car has parked in the school lot
Two OFFICERS coming toward the building

LINDA
(grabs Jimmys hand)
This way

INTERIOR - HALLS - NIGHT

Linda and Jimmy running down the darkened halls
Jimmy sees a door leading to the basement

Linda pulls open the heavy fire door

They make their way down the metal stairs -- into the
bowels of the school

INTERIOR - SCHOOL FURNACE ROOM - NIGHT

Huddled in the furnace room
A ruddy glow coming from behind the large furnace doors
A slight RUMBLING from the boilers

Moving through the floor above they can hear FOOTSTEPS
Doors OPENING and CLOSING A quick search going on
Then the feet leave The outside door SLAMS SHUT

The COPS are gone

Linda and Jimmy breathe easier

Linda looks upset

JIMMY
What is it
LINDA
I dont know I dont know what
Im doing here --

Lindas doubts emerging -- unsure what shes doing
JIMMY
But you saw -- the men go under
the sand
LINDA
Yes yes but Im not sure what

I saw anymore

Just then -- they hear a new strange RUMBLE
DEEPER than the boiler and all around them

JIMMY
(listening)
Whats that

Linda looks at the FLOOR of the furnace room Concrete
It begins to CRACK then HEAVE
They both fall back against the stairs

The floor ERUPTS -- CRACK

A GLEAMING bronze-red METAL POD rears its head Alien
technology no human has ever seen -- rising up on a shiny
metal telescoped neck -- flexible capable of rotating a
full circle -- it confronts them

A ruby red eye in the tip It all but HISSES cobra-like
Thrashing around Grabbing for light and air

Jimmy SCREAMS

The thing takes note -- and like a finger withdrawn
reflexively from a hot stove it RETRACTS

Slithering back down into the floor -- like a giant roach
As suddenly as it appeared -- its gone

Shaking like a leaf -- Jimmy goes over to the torn up
section of the floor

A gaping hole -- going down 10 feet -- the entrance
to an underground tunnel

LINDA
Dont go in
JIMMY
Im not
(backs off)

They must be tunneling under the
whole town

LINDA
We cant do this alone Weve got
to get help

JIMMY
(remembering)
There was a man named Colonel Wilson
from the Air Force Base He was
talking in our class He said we could
visit him any time we wanted Ill bet
he could do something

LINDA
Lets try

She takes his hand and they run up the stairs leaving
the gaping hole in the basement behind them

INTERIOR - CAR - NIGHT

Linda Magnuson driving like a madwoman
She looks at her watch

DISSOLVE TO

INTERIOR - COL WILSONS OFFICE - NIGHT

Col Wilson is sitting back in his chair
Staring at his desk
Slowly tapping the eraser end of his pencil on the desk

Jimmy and Linda watch him intently
Waiting for a response

JIMMY
(fearful)
Colonel Wilson -- whatever is
supposed to happen -- its supposed

to happen at midnight
They all look at the wall clock 1120

LINDA
I assure you -- its true Colonel

Their conviction is enormous But the story is mind-boggling
Wilson looks at them -- then at Sgt Rinaldi

COL WILSON
(shakes his head)
I can see that youre sincere but
Im sure you can understand how hard
it is to believe this story

The BUZZER in the Colonels office buzzes
He flicks the switch

AIDES VOICE
Colonel Lts Hollis and Johnson are
here to see you sir
Wilson suspicion growing looks at Rinaldi

INTERIOR - THE COLONELS RECEPTION AREA - OUTSIDE

Lts Hollis and Johnson the men we saw at the pit are
waiting to go in Sidearms in the holsters

COL WILSONS VOICE
(after a beat)

-- Send them in

The Colonels AIDE (CURTIS) nods for them to go in
Lts Hollis and Johnson -- very grim -- go in

INTERIOR - COL WILSONS OFFICE - NIGHT

The door swings open

The Colonel at his desk -- seemingly alone in the room
Hollis and Johnson step inside and draw their service
weapons

Rinaldi immediately jumps them from behind the door --
knocking the guns away Rinaldi gets the drop on them
Two MPs rush into the office -- guns drawn on Hollis
and Johnson

RINALDI
You two are under arrest

Hollis and Johnson are dragged to their feet by MPs

COL WILSON
Now you two are going to tell me
what this is all about

Before he can go further Johnson and Hollis get a peculiar
look on their faces They GRAB the back of their heads --
and CRASH to the ground -- SPASMING

Wilson looks shocked
Sgt Rinaldi kneels over them Feels for the pulse in
their necks

RINALDI
(looking up astounded)
Theyre dead

Jimmy and Linda come out of the Colonels lavatory where
they were hiding They look at the two bodies

Wilson looks at them -- then at the two bodies The
backs of their necks He and Rinaldi are looking at
TWO RED SPOTS on the necks of Hollis and Johnson
Rinaldi meets the Colonels eyes Shaken

Linda and Jimmy turn away from the sight
CURTIS the Colonels aide comes in With him -- more
of the Colonels men

Wilson looks at the wall clock 1126 It takes him
only a second to leap into action

COL WILSON
Close the base Seal the perimeter
Alert base security

Curtis jumps to
COL WILSON (CONTD)
(to Rinaldi)
I want these two men taken to sick
bay and autopsied

Colonel Wilson looks at Jimmy My God is it true

The Colonel walks to his windows and opens the levelor
blinds He looks out at something In the distance --

bathed in SPOTLIGHTS -- is a ROCKET of some kind

The Colonel stares at it -- joined by Rinaldi Both
of them thinking now Jimmy goes over -- looks also
Now Jimmy sees it -- a gleaming ROCKET being prepared

for launch Awash with lights

JIMMY
Whats that

The Colonel doesnt answer -- looks at Rinaldi
Theyre joined by several CIVILIAN and Air Force
TECHNICIANS

TECHNICIAN
Whats going on

COL WILSON
Weve sealed the base Im
increasing security around the
launch

TECHNICIAN 1
(alarmed)
Is something wrong

COL WILSON
Im not sure

The Colonel looks at Jimmy -- whos waiting for an
explanation

COL WILSON (CONTD)
(to Jimmy)
Jimmy looks

We have a launch scheduled for
tonight We thought by launching
it from here we could minimize
publicity

at him -- still doesnt understand

COL WILSON (CONTD)
Were disguising it as a military
satellite launch Only its not
a satellite

Jimmy and Linda look at each other

The Colonel

The Colonel

Linda looks

COL WILSON (CONTD)
(nods to the Tech)
Go ahead Tell them

TECHNICIAN 1
Its a soft landing mission

JIMMY
Wheres it going

TECHNICIAN 2
To Mars

JIMMY
(eyes wide)
Mars

shoots Jimmy a glance

LINDA
What will the rocket do

nods for the Technician to explain

ENGINEER
It will explore a 50-mile square of
Mars -- looking for life Its

designed to retrieve samples from
beneath the Martian surface down
to 200 feet

COL WILSON
Earth and Mars are in this relative
position only once every 20 years

TECH 2
(getting concerned)
We have to launch tonight

puzzled

LINDA
Youre looking for life
JIMMY
They didnt find any signs of life
on the Viking missions

SCIENTIST
Thats why were looking beneath
the surface this time Something
might be able to live down below

Silence A thought forming

COL WILSON
And if it does -- it might not want
to be found

LINDA
(realizes)
The tunnels

Colonel Wilson and Rinaldi look at each other

COL WILSON

(faces Jimmy and Linda)
Theres something you two should know
Two nights ago there was a very large
meteor fall on our radar -- but no
reports of a strike We were on full
alert for an hour and weve had
search teams out looking for a sign
of some kind of impact or landing
Hollis and Johnson were the ground
team assigned to your area

The Colonel goes back to the window -- looking out at
the rocket being readied

COL WILSON (CONTD)
I want every man on the base checked
I want updates every five minutes
from launch control
The clock on the wall reads 1156

Copper wire

CUT TO

INTERIOR - AUTOPSY ROOM - SICK BAY - NIGHT

Two teams of AIR FORCE SURGEONS are operating on the
corpses of Hollis and Johnson each of whom lies face
down on a stainless steel table

Slowly -- painstakingly -- a surgeon removes a long needle
from the back of Hollis NECK
Everyone stares hard as he holds it up

The surgeon wipes blood from it The NEEDLE is extremely
narrow -- the color of gleaming BRONZE -- with a tiny
radiant CRYSTAL glowing on the tip of it

The surgeon carries it over to a work bench As he
passes an electric pump the needle gives a slight
RINGING SOUND and the crystal GLOWS

Startled the surgeon passes the needle around the
electrical pump The needle fluoresces brighter and
softer as he moves it EVERYONE gathers round

The surgeon WAVES the needle around It reacts when its
near a TELEPHONE a LIGHT SOCKET near peoples
HEADS

He puts it next to an FM RADIO

Turns on the radio and tunes the dial

The NEEDLE REACTS to every setting on the dial
until at one setting the needle gives a tiny BANG
and a FLASH -- and the surgeon drops it grimacing

The surgeon flaps his hand His teeth clenched with pain
His GLOVE is burned through and his FINGERTIPS

are blackened with wisps of smoke rising from them

The needle on the floor is still intact

CUT TO

INTERIOR - COLONELS OFFICE - NIGHT

The Communications Officer holds a phone for Wilson

COMM OFFICER
They just finished the autopsy on
Hollis and Johnson

(relaying from other

end of call)
They say theyve removed an electronic
pin from the base of both Hollis and
Johnsons brains The thing was
capable of receiving radio signals It
triggered a cerebral hemorrhage in both
of them -- on command

A crushing statement for Jimmy

JIMMY
(to Colonel Wilson)
Then my Mom and Dad

Jimmy looks around at Linda Colonel Wilson Everyone
No one says anything
Linda puts her arm around Jimmy

COL WILSON
Jim -- can you take us to that
place -- the sand pit

Jimmy nods yes

COL WILSON (CONTD)
(to another Officer)
Are the jeeps and half-tracks okay

TRANSPORT OFFICER
Ready to go when you are sir

COL WILSON
(to Jimmy)
A base like this has troops stationed
on it to ensure its security Were
not out of options yet

Colonel Wilson turns to Rinaldi
COL WILSON (CONTD)

Lets roll Rinaldi Curtis
Everyone we can muster goes

RINALDI

Two CYBORGS moving around next to her

Linda is face down -- still wearing her nurses uniform --
unconscious
Her hair is pushed up off her bare neck

A GIANT MACHINE above her begins to push a CRYSTAL NEEDLE
down toward the BACK OF HER NECK

CLOSING on her neck -- a small spot of light illuminating
the SPOT where it will be implanted --

at the base of her brain

Jimmy spins around and faces Mrs McKeltch

They point the long silver weapon down the tunnel It has
a wide flared barrel

Jimmy SEES the operation of the weapon

The needle -- HUMMING with a high-pitched cold WHINE

A peaceful look on her face Unconscious Unaware

CLOSE SHOT -- The needle almost touching her skin
A BURST of gunfire stops the progress

Another BURST and the GIANT MACHINE in the operating chamber
sparks -- and SHATTERS apart

They run over to the table

Two of the Colonels men gently lift Linda off the
table

As soon as they do she starts to come to

LINDA

Theyve sealed off the entrance

Colonel Wilson surveys the scene -- desperately

COL WILSON

Start digging

The men start grabbing rocks boulders dirt -- shoveling
clawing at the collapsed part of the tunnel and ceiling

DEMOLITION MAN
(shouts to Col Wilson)
Three minutes thirty left

They dig harder
Its impossible -- the dirt slides back in

Jimmy SEES an abandoned Martian WEAPON One of the blasters

CURTIS
(sees it too)
They use these to tunnel Maybe
we can --
He picks it up Totally unfamiliar with its operation

JIMMY
I know how to use it

Colonel Wilson looks at him

JIMMY (CONTD)
I saw them do it

Colonel Wilson nods for Curtis to give Jimmy the weapon

They all stand back as Jimmy takes the blaster -- and points
it at the ceiling
Fiddles with the controls

It FIRES -- a continuous soft-red beam that turns the ceiling
red --

The walls and ceiling start to BUBBLE

Then it EXPLODES --

Theres a HOLE punched through to above

Their faces -- terrified -- running for their lives

Jimmy and Linda and the Colonel and Curtis

About to DIE
Just as he SCREAMS

And then everything blew up
And then I woke up

DAD
Thats a doozy of a dream son

JIMMY
It was so real Dad

DAD
It was all made of stuff thats
happened to you in the last few
days The sand pit in back of
the house and the meteor shower
and meeting your teacher and the
colonel at school and being afraid
of the new kids because you dont
know them

MOM
Its all this moving from place to
place Were never settled Im
having nightmares myself

JIMMY

MOM
(looking back)
Good night
JIMMY
(sleepy)
Night

They turn off the light and close the door

Jimmy closes his eyes and snuggles down to sleep
His eyes open one last time and he looks at the
clock on his bedside table -- 440

The rain hits the panes of his window outside
Jimmy looks out the window

Then he SEES it -- a HORRIBLE GLOWING SHAPE coming down
through the rain

The SOUND exactly the same as in the dream

Coming down behind the hill in back of his house

MOVE IN ON JIMMYS FACE WATCHING
And now he knows exactly whats going to happen

THE END
