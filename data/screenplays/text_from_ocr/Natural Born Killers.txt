INT COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A coffee shop somewhere in New Mexico MICKEY KNOX his back
turned to us is sitting at the counter finishing his meal We
hear the PINGBANGof a pinball machine being played OFF
SCREEN

MABEL a waitress comes over and fills Mickeys coffee cup

MICKEY
What kind of pies do you have

MABEL
Apple pecan cherry and key lime

MICKEY
Which do you recommend

MABEL
The key lime is great but its
an acquired taste

MICKEY
I havent had a key lime pie in ten
years

MABEL

When ya had it did ya like it

MICKEY
No but that dont mean much I was a
completely different person ten years
ago Lets give key lime a day in
court And a large glass of milk

Mabel turns to her right

MABEL
(to someone OS)
Should I make that two pieces

CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see for the first time MALLORY KNOX
Mickeys wife sitting on a counter stool next to him Her back
is to the camera as well

MALLORY
Nada Rosey

MABEL
(annoyed)
My names not Rosey
(points at name tag)
Its Mabel

Mabel exits FRAME

MALLORY
Whatever

Mallory hops from the stool walks over and grabs the JAR next
to the cash register then dumping out the coins on the counter
she selects a quarter

MABEL
Hey what the hell do you think youre
doin

Mallory saunters past the COWBOY playing pinball As his eyes
follow Mallory he loses his ball

She walks to the jukebox in the back inserts the quarter
selects a song punches the buttons a needle lands on a record

and a good God almighty rockabilly tune cuts through the coffee
shop

Mabel brings Mickey his pie and milk

MABEL
(to Mickey)
She ought not be doing that Thats
for Jerrys kids not rock n roll

CAMERA moves around to a CU of Mickey This is the first time
we see him As he takes a bite of green pie

MICKEY
I cant take her anywhere

Mallory starts doing a slow seductive fandango around the coffee
shop Shes really cooking and smoking
Pinball Cowboy and Mabel are starting to wonder just who the
hell these people are

Mickey isnt paying much attention Hes too busy enjoying his
pie and milk

EXT COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A dirty pickup truck sporting a Confederate flag decal pulls
up to the coffee shop SONNY OTIS and EARL three
tough-looking rednecks pile out Steam rises from beneath the
pickups hood

EARL
Goddamn this sumbitch is runnin hot
Yall go inside Im gonna check er
out

INT COFFEE SHOP - DAY

The LOUDNESS of the Rockabilly song slaps Sonny and Otis in
their faces as they walk inside the door The sexy sight of
Mallory doing the ubang stomp stops them in their tracks

SONNY
Good God almighty What the hell is
that

oTiIs

Thats a bitch outta hell son
Otis and Sonny exchange looks

SONNY
Take a run at ‘er kiddo

Otis heads toward Mallory Sonny moves over to the counter next
to Mickey

SONNY
Miller Mabel

MABEL
Comin up

Otis stands in front of Mallory trying to copy what shes
doing Her eyes are closed at the moment so she doesnt see
him

Mabel sets the Miller down in front of Sonny Sonny takes a
swig enjoying the floor show
SONNY
(to Mickey)
Thats some sweet piece of meat aint
it

Mickey turns from his pie and looks at Sonny His expression
betrays nothing

MICKEY
Her names Mallory

The needle lifts off the record The song ends
Mallory opens her eyes and sees Otis
OTIS
Hells Bells Dont stop now sugar

Im just getting warmed up

Otis gives her his best shit-eating grin before turning to
Sonny

Sonny gurgles out a laugh

SONNY
Hey I think shes sweet on you

Otis turns to Mallory as she PUNCHES him hard in the face
spinning him around

Sonny spews his mouthful of Highlife

Mallory grabs the back of Otis head and SMASHES it down on the
table cracking the linoleum

Otis buckles dropping to his knees

Sonny jumps off the counter stool but Mickeys hand clutches
hold of his shoulder

Sonny spins around toward Mickey loaded for bear and points
his finger at him threateningly

Before any threat can be made Mickey whips a large buck knife
out from its sheath and in a flash SLICES off Sonnys finger

Sonnys finger drops on his boot He grabs his aching hand
Blood flows from the wound

MICKEY
Just because my womans mopping up the
floor with your buddy is no reason for
you to join in

Mickey makes five lightning quick SLASHING SWINGS The buck
knife slips back into its sheath At first there seems to be
no difference with Sonny Finally blood flows from the slices
made in his face and chest Sonny collapses

The SHORT-ORDER COOK charges out of the kitchen at Mickey
wielding a meat cleaver and screaming

Mickey whips out a 45 automatic from a shoulder holster inside
his jacket and FIRES

BULLETS POV Heading fast toward Short-Order Cooks face It
HITS Short-Order Cook puts his hands to his face and falls to
the ground screaming

Mickey spots Earl whos standing outside the plate glass
window Earls watched the whole shebang

Earl mouths Fuck He turns and runs for it
Mickey hurls the knife through the plate glass window which

SHATTERS The knife PLUNGES deep into Earls back He hits the
ground dead

Mickey turns to Mallory Shes sitting on op of Otis SLAMMING
his head repeatedly on the floor

MICKEY
Honey

Mallory looks up at Mickey She gets off Otis and moves to
Mickeys side

Mickey trains his 45 on Pinball Cowboy whos shaking in his
cowboy boots Mickey aims at Mabel whos clutching the coffee
pot crying

MICKEY
(to Mallory)
Pick one

Mallory does eanie meanie minie moe pointing back and forth
from Mabel to Pinball Cowboy

MALLORY
Eanie meanie minie moe catch a
nigger by the tow If he hollers let
him go Eanie meanie minie moe My
mom told me to pick the best one and

She ends pointing at Mabel Mabels crying She screams

MABEL
NO

Mickey FIRES the 45 The bullet CHINKS through the coffee pot
Mabels holding and explodes THUNKING her in the chest She
hits the floor dead

Mickey and Mallory join hands and walk over to the Pinball
Cowboy who stands in a pool of his own urine

MALLORY

Pinball Cowboy nods yes

The two killers plant a big wet kiss on each others mouths
Then holding hands Mickey and Mallory walk out of the cafe

(surprised)
Wayne Gayle

INT JAIL - VISITING AREA - DAY

WAYNE GAYLE a young energetic commando journalist ala
Geraldo Rivera is sitting on the visitor side of the county jail
visiting area Wayne is alone and the visiting area is empty
Apparently some arrangement was made for the visit Wayne has a
miniature tape recorder in his hand and is testing it

WAYNE
(into recorder)
Testing onetwothree
testingonethreeover
over over Mickey Knox meeting

Wayne shuts off the recorder rewinds and plays it back It
works beautifully He hits the record button and conceals the
recorder in his sport coat jacket

The door opens on the prisoner side and Mickey Knox is lead into
the room by two SHERIFFS DEPUTIES Mickeys wearing the country
jail blue jump-suit He has a thick and wide leather belt around
his waist with a metal ring built into each side Long sturdy
chains with handcuffs on each end are wrapped across his body
and through the rings binding his arms to his sides His hands
and feet are double cuffed

The Deputies both have their guns drawn ready to blow Mickey in
half at the slightest provocation For a man wrapped and bound
in chains Mickey seems strangely in control of his environment
Even restrained as he is by the symbols of society (the chains
jail guards guns jump-suit) he remains a dangerous
intimidating and fascinating figure
Wayne takes in the image of Mickey

WAYNE
(to himself)
Showtime

Mickeys roughly shoved into his seat on the prisoners side of
the glass The Deputies move to their place off to the side by
the wall

WAYNE
Hello Mickey Weve never been
introduced but Im Wayne Gayle I
dont know if youve ever heard of me
or remember me I was one of the
reporters outside the courthouse during
your trial---

MICKEY
Everybody knows who you are Youre
famous
Wayne pauses and retorts
WAYNE
I could say the same thing about you
(smiles)

I want to thank you very much for
seeing me

Mickey is silent

WAYNE
I have a television show Its very
popular Every week we do a profile on
a different serial killer You dont
mind if I call you a serial killer do
you

Mickey shakes his head no

WAYNE
The episode we did on Mickey and
Mallory was one of our most popular ones

MICKEY
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy

WAYNE
Yes
MICKEY
Whose ratings were higher

WAYNE
Yours

MICKEY
How bout Ted Bundy Ever do one on
him

WAYNE
Yes Yours got the larger Nielson share

MICKEY
Goodyuppie piece of shit

WAYNE
What Id like to do---

MICKEY
How bout Manson

WAYNE
Manson beat you

MICKEY
Yeah its pretty hard to beat the
king

WAYNE

Weve been waiting to do a follow up
episode on you for a long time And
that time has definitely come

(pause)
I feel its apparent to anyone whos
hip to whats going on that the prison
board has thrown the constitution
straight out the fuckin window
You and Mallory may be killers but
youre not insane You belong ina
prison not in an asylum The prison
board is blatantly railroading you into
a hospital for the sole purpose of
turning you into vegetables Now some
people are saying So what I am not
one of those people If we avert our
eyes while they do this to you we give
them permission to do it again whenever
they see fit Today they wipe clean
your mind because they feel your
actions are dangerous tomorrow they
wipe clean my mind because they feel

what I say is dangerous Where does
it all stop

No response from Mickey

WAYNE
My problem Mickey is that you dont
exactly inspire empathy Im all alone
on this I need your help I want
what the prison board is doing to be
the focus of our follow up episode
Now I have interviews with chairman of
the prison board Dewight McClusky about
this issue And Im tellin ya
Mickey he looks bad The two
psychologists they used for their
psychiatric kangaroo court wont talk
to us which always looks bad I have
an interview with both the judge of
your trial Bert Steinsma and the
psychologist and author Emil
Reinghold both of which discount the
notion that youre insane You put
that all together and what the state
is doing becomes obvious But the
network isnt satisfied They feel the
show needs another element It needs
you In order to put the show on the
air I need to get an interview with
you You havent talked to the press
since your trial Now a few days
before you get transferred to an
asylum you grant an interview on
television with Wayne Gayle Were
talkin a media event here Every son
of a bitch out the with a TV sets
gonna tune in to see that
Well make their motives so blatant
well shame em into dropping the whole
thing At least for a little while
the publicity would keep them from just
giving you and Mallory lobotomies
Well whatta ya say

MICKEY
Have you talked to Mallory about this

WAYNE
She wont even see me Mickey Now
youre not supposed to know anything
about whats going on with her but Im
gonna tell ya somethin Since you
twove been sentenced Mallory hasnt
spoken one word

MICKEY
She doesnt talk

WAYNE
Not to anybody She sings

MICKEY
She sings What does she sing

WAYNE
Songs Hes A Rebel Leader Of The
Pack Town Without Pity that Dusty

Springfield song I Only Want To Be
With You Thats what I hear anyway
Her behaviour was the main thing the
doctors report used against you So
even if she would see me which she
wont I couldnt put her on camera
anyway If I ask her Mallory are
you insane And she starts singing
Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road
that blows our whole case

Mickey cracks a smile
The guards come over to take him away

DEPUTY SHERIFF (0S)
Time motherfucker

They grab Mickey and jerk him from the chair Wayne stands

WAYNE
Wait a minute Mickey I need an
answer

Mickey doesnt respond He just leaves with the guards
WAYNE
(yells after him)
Just think about it But dont think
too long

INT MICKEYS CELL - DAY

DISSOLVE TO
INT RESTAURANT - DAY

MEDIUM CU of Wayne holding a piece of paper in front of his face
and reading from it out loud We hear Waynes VOICE over
Mallorys singing before the last scene DISSOLVES

WAYNE
(reading out loud)
After taking a few days to reflect on
your offer Ive come to the conclusion
that you are one hundred percent
correct A national TV interview would
be very advantageous to both Mallory
and I The only obstacle is theyre
shipping me out to the funny farm in
four days However that is your
problem and not mine I feel confident
youll manage Heres to us making
television history Sincerely Mickey
Knox

Wayne drops the letter down from in front of his face

WAYNE
Am I a God or what

We now see the restaurant adorned with the standard Dennys
decorum Waynes team is gathered in a booth that surrounds the
remains of a greasy meal In response to his last remark they
all pretend they are praying to him

The team consists of SCOTT the cameraman who wears wild
t-shirts (presently a t-shirt with the movie She Devils On
Wheels splashed on the front) ROGER the soundman who wears
wild Hawaiian shirts and Bermuda shorts and UNRULY JULIE
Waynes assistant a young lady who wears Bermuda shorts a
baseball jersey and a dark sports coat no matter how hot the
weather is at any time Rogers never seen without his
recorder Scotts never without his camera and Unruly Julie
always has her giant notebook These dishevelled film types are
all in their twenties and are a marked contrast to Waynes
stylish yuppie demeanour

Unruly Julie pops the cork on a champagne bottle The guys hold
out coffee mugs while Julie fills Julie however drinks
straight from the bottle

NOTE This scene is to be played at a rapid fire His Girl
Friday pace

WAYNE
Drink up This is a celebration This

interview with the most charismatic
serial killer ever one day before hes
being shipped to a mental hospital for
the rest of his life This is one of
those golden moments that happens maybe
only four times in a lucky journalists
career This is Wallace with Noriega
this is Elton John confessing his
bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone this
is the tearful reporting of the
Hindenberg disaster this is Truffaut
setting the record straight on
Hitchcock this is a Robert Capa photo

make him think his grey matter depends
on it When I told Woody and the brass
about this coup they practically shit

The Mickey and Mallory Knox murder
trial was so event filled it made the
crime spree that took place before pale

was unexpected was how well Mickeys
performance would be

JUDGE STEINSMA
Mickey was surprisingly effective
When I was told I was to be the judge

Oh thats rich Well considering
that Mickey Knox turn his court into
a mockery and personally made him look

benevolent of Judge Steinsma As far
as Mickey being an excellent amateur
lawyer maybe Im old fashioned but
when I went to law school we were
taught the object was to win the case
which I did

able to totally psyche out any
confidence Ferigno had
NORMAN
He squashed him mentally before

He had the edge The minds edge

WAYNE

How can you say that you admire them

NORMAN
Its like this Wayne Two people are
standing in a dark room waiting for the
other to attack These two people
cant see each other yet they know
theyre there Now they can either
stand in the dark room forever waiting
until they die of boredom or one of
them can make the first move

WAYNE
Why cant they just shake hands and be
friends
NORMAN
They cant because neither knows if the
other is a deranged senseless killer
like the Knoxs So you may as well
make the first move

WAYNE
And they made the first move

NORMAN
Unfortunately yes

SIMON
But you see thats okay Wayne

WAYNE
Why

SIMON
They passed the edge along to us

WAYNE
How so

SIMON
By taking away our legs Now we have
to fight harder to get ahead than

the fighting spirit Before this

again

Never is a very long time Wayne A
word only the weak use Im not a sore
loser Even if I dont have a leg to
stand on Im going to get up and fight
this world until Im on top again

NORMAN
Thats the Mickey and Mallory way

SIMON
Thats the way of the world

NORMAN
Theyre shocking the world into
remembering the primal law

SIMON
Survival of the fittest

WAYNE
One last question Usually Mickey and
Mallory kill all of their victims Why
did they let you two survive

The brothers pause then turn to Wayne

NORMAN
They had us tied down during one of
their house raids youve seen the
headlines and they were taking a
chainsaw to our legs before they were
gonna kill us

SIMON
Just for fun I guess

NORMAN
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says
Hey these are the Brothers Hun

SIMON
Mickey stops sawin on my leg and says
Oh my God Im your biggest fan

NORMAN
Apparently theyve seen all our films

SIMON

Conquering Huns of Neptune

Wayne MOS

CUT INTO INTERVIEW

NEIL POPE
It is my belief that Mickey and Mallory
Knox are a cultural phenomena that
could only exist in our sexually
repressed society A flower that could
only bloom amidst a grotesque fast food
culture A what I tried to do with
Thrill Killers was trace the root of
the problem all the way down the vine
to the original bad seed Yet amidst
the violence and murder and carnage
youve got the structure of a Wagnerian
love story

BACK TO THE POPE INTERVIEW

WAYNE (0S)
Why did you kill Mallory Both of
them are still alive

NEIL POPE
It was dramatic license no doubt But
I felt an operatic love story needed an
operatic ending The two of them kill
for each other They offer the death
of their victims to each other like
other lovers offer flowers or bon bons
So what more natural what more
organic what more poetic than Mallory
offering her death to Mickey Its
where its been leading since day one
We worked it in the movie by using a
what if they escaped situation I
think it works beautifully Youd be
surprised People come up to me at the
end of the movie in tears

BUFFY
I didnt play Mallory the murderer I
didnt play her as a butcher I played
her as a woman in love who also
happens to murder people I didnt
want her to be at arms length from the
audience or myself If you play her as
this wild maniac the audience never
has to deal with her If you see a
decapitation in a movie you just say
Oh wow a neat special effect
Because you cant relate toa
decapitation It doesnt mean anything
to anybody because its not personal
Decapitations dont fall into most
peoples realm of life experiences
But if you show somebody in a movie
getting a paper cut the whole audience
squirms Because everybody can relate
to a paper cut

REINGHOLD who sits behind the desk

To get a psychiatric view on the
strange attraction Mickey and Mallory
seems to have we talked with Doctor
Emil Reinghold noted psychologist and
author

Wayne begins his interview

WAYNE
Can you shed some light Doctor
Reinghold on why the public has taken
a pair of sociopaths so close to their
bosom

DR REINGHOLD
Well for one the media has done a
tremendous job of turning the husband
and wife mass murderers into
celebrities But its the countrys
youth who have turned the couple into
the ultimate anti-heroes Basically
the very thing that makes them most
lethal is the exact same thing that
captures the publics hearts and
minds -- Mickey and Mallorys operatic
devotion to each other In a world
where people cant seem to make the
simplest relationships work and the
slightest emotional commitment is
considered devastating Mick and
Mallory have a do-or-die romance of a
Shakespearean magnitude To the
countrys youth 75 percent of which
are coming from broken homes thats
appealing They have an us against
the world posture which always appeals
to youth And theyve taken that
posture seventeen steps beyond

Its not us against the world its
were gonna kill the world Theyre
exciting I read their file and I find
myself turning the page like it was a
paperback Why do disillusioned youths
get into Mickey and Mallory Why do
disillusioned housewives read romance
novels Why are you filming this
special Because you know as well as I
do you say ‘tonight at nine Charles
Manson speaks everybodys going to
tune in to hear what he says Mickey
and Mallory have shocked a country numb
with violence Theyve created a world
where only two exist and anybody who
inadvertently enters that world is
murdered

MICKEY
When you study the martial arts they
give out belts that come in different
colors to signify what level youre at
in your training Am I correct on that
point

GRACE
Yes you are

MICKEY
What was the color of Tims belt

GRACE
The style of fighting that Tim studied
didnt believe in belts

MICKEY
Is that a fact Well then Grace
could you tell us what form of martial
arts it was that Tim was schooled in

GRACE
Tim studied several styles but his
favorite was Jeet Kune Do

MICKEY
Jeet Kune DoNow I did some research
on that form of fighting and I found
out that Jeet Kune Do was a style
developed by Bruce Lee Did you know
that

GRACE
Yes I did Thats why Tim studied it
Because it was Bruce Lees fighting
style

CU of COURT CLERKS HANDS typing in SLOW MOTION
MICKEY

Now while I freely admit total
ignorance on the subject I have heard
of Bruce Lee And I was under the
impression that Bruce Lee was one of
the if not the greatest fighter in the
history of martial arts

GRACE
Thats what Tim said

MICKEY
So I think it would be safe to say
that anybody who studied the fighting
style that Bruce Lee arguably the
greatest martial artist of all times
developed for nine years that would be
a fella who could defend himself
Would you describe Tim that way Grace

GRACE
Yes I would

Mickey points at Grace with the pencil in his hand

CU of Mickeys

MICKEY
Point of fact werent Tims hands
registered as lethal weapons

GRACE
Yes they were

hand holding the pencil

That means his hands are considered a

correct on that point

INT JUDGES DEN - DAY

Interview with Judge Steinsma in his den at home

MOS SHOT of Wayne and Judge talking

The interview

WAYNE (VO)
We spoke with retired Judge Steinsma at
his home in Baltimore Maryland

WAYNE
Was there any vengeance on your part
with your unique sentence

JUDGE STEINSMA
Yes unquestionably After they did
what they did in my court and judge
worth his robe will tell you the same
thing It couldnt help but affect my
decision Thats why they have judges
Were supposed to be fair to a fault
but when its showtime we have to make
a decision Thats why we dont just
input all the facts into a computer for
the appropriate punishment I couldnt
give them the death penalty See
California hops back and forth on that
issue Mickey and Mallory went to
court when it was out of favor which
is actually good because it leaves more
room for imagination Anybody can give
somebody the chair When you have
someone who deserves to die and you
cant kill them you have to be
creative And if the bastards had let
it stand it would of been the perfect
sentence It hit em right where they
lived Far more punishing than the
death sentence

WAYNE
Would you please describe for our
viewers what your sentence was

JUDGE STEINSMA
Well in a rogues gallery of killers
Mickey and Mallory are very unique
Ive seen a lot of killers in my day
and theyre a very cold lot They have
no more feelings about taking a
persons life than squashing a tiny
bug Its all the same to them Well
Mickey and Mallory were that kill em
to watch their expression change
attitude personified Except with each
other And since they lived only for
each other I wanted to attack that at
its very root So in a nutshell my
sentence was double life for each
without any possibility for parole
That would be fairly standard in their
case The twist I added was that the
husband and wife would have no contact
or correspondence with each other for
the rest of their lives And they
would never receive any word or
information about the other

So basically once the cell door slams
shut Mickey and Mallory will
completely disappear from each others
life Theyll never know when the

other dies But alas the best laid
plans of mice and men

Board about this curious turn of

INT MCCLUSKYS OFFICE - DAY
Waynes interviewing McClusky

WAYNE
Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved
to an asylum And who made the
decision

MCCLUSKY
The prison board made the decision A
board of which I belong Were the
who The why is simple Mickey and
Mallory are mentally ill and need to be
under a doctors care where hopefully
theyll receive the help they need

WAYNE
Mickey and Mallory were deemed
competent in a mental examination
before their trial Im confused
Whats changed

MCCLUSKY
Well since that time theyve killed
one person during their trail And
since their incarceration theyve
killed one psychologist along with
several guards and inmates

WAYNE
When they were found competent before
hey had already killed fifty people
ther than the fact theyre a
isciplinary problem which frankly
houldnt surprise anyone I still
ont see where this situation is any
ifferent then it was before So I
sk you again Mr McClusky whats
hanged

Qqeaanaod

MCCLUSKY

Whats changed Mr Gayle is our

minds We felt they were competent a
year ago A year has passed sir a

year where they were under close
observation day in and day out and
their behaviour has led us to believe we
were wrong

WAYNE
Who is we

MCCLUSKY
The prison board and the doctors who
examined them

WAYNE
Were any of the doctors who made the
first evaluation on the Knoxs mental
state asked to re-examine them

MCCLUSKY
Using the same doctors is not common
practice

WAYNE

I take it by your answer it was a whole
new team

MCCLUSKY
Now that you bring it up yes They
were different men I hadnt really
thought that much about it Since many
psychiatric opinions are by a rule
sought out for this kind of situation
What do you think normally happens
The Knoxs are assigned a family
psychologist that takes care of them
throughout the rest of their lives
The state doesnt work like that

sought were those of Albert

INT DR REINGHOLDS OFFICE - DAY
Back with Dr Reinghold Hes laughing

DR REINGHOLD
Its a funny situation actually If
anyone besides Mickey and Mallory give
a damn what the prison board is doing
would be considered an outrage The
prison board is basically saying We
cant handle these guys Theyve
moved em around twice since their
sentence started
They were a handful everywhere they
went Now the prisons theyre at now
want them outta there But no other
prisons gonna be stupid enough to take
em So the prison board is left
scratching their heads wondering what
theyre gonna do Well what they
decided to do was to set up a kangaroo
medical court that found them crazy
Then they get them transferred to
Nystrom Medical Asylum or Lobotomy Bay
as its referred to in the psychiatric
circle Put em on a strict dope and
electro shock diet and Mickey and
Mallory cease to be a problem to
anybody except the orderlies who clean
out the bedpans which if you want to
see them get theirs thats all well
and good But theres something being
said here Forget the immorality for a
second Forget the corruption and the
skulduggery involved What the board
is saying is we give up Mickey and
Mallory ran amuck in polite society
They were put in an alternative society
and they ran amuck there too All the
powers that be cant deal with these
two kids And whatever cant be
assimilated has to be terminated

WAYNE
So in your opinion Mickey and Mallory
are not insane

DR REINGHOLD
Insane no Psychotic yes A menace
to living creatures yes But to
suggest that theyre insane gives the
impression that they dont know right
from wrong Mickey and Mallory know
the difference between right and wrong
They just dont give a damn

Of a surf tormented shore
As I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand--

Through my fingers to the deep
While I weep--while I weep

Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream

make sure everyone of those son of a
bitches down there ends up on the
unemployment line In fact Id sue
every man down there personally I

bring the LA County Jail to its knees
I would do expose after expose on the
brutality and the conditions and the
inhumanity that exists here

Mallory winks at Mickey Mickey smiles and begins wrapping tape
around the barrel of his shotgun

Mickey Knoxs plan worked We walked
out the front door into my news van
and made our getaway When we were
followed by patrol cars Mallory Knox
killed Deputy Sheriff Duncan Homolka
and tossed his body out of the back
Mickey told authorities over my police
band that I would surely be next if
they didnt give up the pursuit They
took Mickey at his word and called off
the pursuit Why helicopters werent
employed I dont know My only
thought is it all happened too fast for
arrangements to be made Weve just
pulled off to the side of the road to
do this interview Tensions run high--

Mallory what did you think of Mickeys
plan Did you think it would work

MALLORY
It wasnt till we got on the ground
floor that I totally realized they
werent gonna shoot unless we shot
first When we got out of the

God This might work But
Mickey knew it would work all along
There wasnt any doubt in his mind
Its not like there was and he just
didnt show it He knew it would work

WAYNE (0S)
What did you think then

MALLORY
I wondered how long it would be before
wed get to be alone together And I
wondered if I could wait that long

WAYNE (0S)
Did you have anything to do with the
riot in the laundry room

MALLORY
Havent you been listening to a fuckin

Mickey takes the CAMERA from Wayne and while he speaks he
balances it on a fence post

MICKEY
Oh were gonna do a little wrap up
