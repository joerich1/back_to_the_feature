A BRILLIANT SQUARE OF WHITE FILLS THE CENTER OF THE SCREEN

SOUND GIGGLES A young woman and a small hoy - DONNA

Right side up this time Vic Donna and Tad are standing
in front of their house To the right in the driveway
is a small blue car probably a Pinto

VIC (VO)
There

CREDITS ROLL as slides continue to 5s
Theres no other background dialogue as
are watching these little freezeframes of their life
in rapt silence The MONTAGE shows us
a) Vic playing tennis with bearded man of about 30 --
STEVE KEMP We see Donna and Tad in the bg Tad
is on the ground playing with a toy Donna is watch-
ing the match -- but its Steve shes looking at not
her husband

b) Vic standing before a store-front in the city - AD
WORK the sign over the door behind him reads He
shows great pride

c) Vic pushing Tad (who is about four) on a backyard
swing while Donna looks on smiling

a) A backyard barbecue scene Vic in a barbecue chefs
hat and apron turning hot dogs on the grille Friends
with drinks standing around Donna is looking at her
hasband from a distanceand not smiling

) Donna and Tad running through a backyard spray in
bathing suits

Now they come faster half a dozen or more we just get
glimpses of Donna in her slip waving the picture-taker
(Vic we presume) impatiently away Tad in his bedroom
lining up toy cars Vic washing an old Jaguar -- hes
wearing a bathing suit and sunglasses Etc

odds with the picture itself It shows the Camber doar
yard with Joe Cambers garage a red-painted converted
barn in the bg Also in the bg - in front of the
garage doorway -- we see Vics sportscar up on jacks one
rear wheel removed

In the foreground we see Tad Trenton riding on the back of
a huge St Bernard dog Tad is laughing The dog -— CUJO --
appears almost to be grinning

DIRECTORS CREDIT - the last -- APPEARS The MUSIC SWELLS
more and more ominous

THE CAMERA MOVES IN Now the slide FILLS the entire SCREEN
now we see only the small boy astride the giant dog and
now we are ECU ON CUJO his face blurred and fuzzy in this
extreme magnification

As the CAMERA CONTINUES TO MOVE IN we DISSOLVE SLOWLY the

He begins to creep stealthily forward Theres an element
of the comic in this one usually doesnt see a St Bernard
creep up on anvthing

EXT UsO AND THE RABBIT - DAY

The director will cut back and forth as he sees fit but
Cujo actually gets quite close to the rabbit before it
suddenly takes off its legs flyine and its long lollopy
ears laid back (we may even get the impression that the
rabbit has let Cujo creep up just to tease him)
Cujo gives chase barking wildly

EXT THE CHASE - DAY

Once again the director will lay this out as he sees fit
and select his shots depending on exactly what these two
animals give him

Cujo chases the rabbit energetically and seems to he
gaining
