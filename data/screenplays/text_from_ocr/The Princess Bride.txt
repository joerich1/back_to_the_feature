The Princess Bride by S
Morgenstern Chapter One
Buttercup was raised on a small
farm in the country of Florin

DISSOLVE TO

The story hes reading about as the monochromatic look of
the bedroom is replaced by the dazzling color of the English
countryside

GRANDFATHER

(off-screen)
Her favorite pastimes were riding
her horse and tormenting the farm
boy that worked there His name
was Westley but she never called
him that

(to the kid)
Isnt that a wonderful beginning

THE KID
(off-screen doing his best)
Yeah Its really good

GRANDFATHER
(off-screen reading)
Nothing gave Buttercup as much
pleasure as ordering Westley
around

CUT TO

BUTTERCUPS FARM - DAY

BUTTERCUP is standing holding the reins of her horse while
in the background WESTLEY in the stable doorway looks at
her Buttercup is in her late teens doesnt care much about
clothes and she hates brushing her long hair so she isnt
as attractive as she might be but shes still probably the
most beautiful woman in the world

BUTTERCUP
Farm boy Polish my horses
saddle I want to see my face
shining in it by morning

WESTLEY
(quietly watching her)
As you wish

Westley is perhaps half a dozen years older than Buttercup
And maybe as handsome as she is beautiful He gazes at her
as she walks away

GRANDFATHER
(off-screen)
As you wish was all he ever
said to her

DISSOLVE TO

WESTLEY outside chopping wood Buttercup drops two large
buckets near him

BUTTERCUP
Farm Boy Fill these with water --
(a beat)
--please
WESTLEY
As you wish
She leaves his eyes stay on her She stops turns -- he

manages to look away as now her eyes stay on him

GRANDFATHER
(off-screen)
That day she was amazed to
discover that when he was saying
As you wish what he meant was
I love you

DISSOLVE TO

BUTTERCUP IN THE KITCHEN - DUSK
Westley enters with an armload of firewood

GRANDFATHER
(off-screen)
And even more amazing was the day
she realized she truly loved him
back

BUTTERCUP
(pointing to a pitcher
that she could reach herself
Farm Boy fetch me that pitcher

He gets it hands it to her they are standing very close
each other gazing into each others eyes

WESTLEY
As you wish

Now he turns moves outside

DISSOLVE TO

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP outside his tiny hovel in the red
glow of sunset They are locked in a passionate kiss

THE KID
(off-screen)
-hold it hold it-

CUT TO
THE KIDS ROOM
THE KID
What is this Are you trying to
trick me -- Wheres the sports --

Is this a kissing book

GRANDFATHER
-- wait just wait --

THE KID
-- well when does it get good

to
GRANDFATHER
Keep your shirt on Let me read
(reading again)
Westley had no money for marriage
So he packed his few belongings
and left the farm to seek his
fortune across the sea

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP
They stand near the gate to the farm locked in an embrace

GRANDFATHER
(off-screen reading)
It was a very emotional time for
Buttercup --

THE KID
(off-screen groaning)
I dont be-leeve this

BUTTERCUP
I fear Ill never see you again

WESTLEY
Of course you will

BUTTERCUP
But what if something happens to
you

WESTLEY

Hear this now I will come for you

BUTTERCUP
But how can you be sure

WESTLEY
This is true love You think this
happens every day

He smiles at her she smiles too throws her arms so tightly
around him They kiss Then as Westley walks away Buttercup
watches him go

GRANDFATHER
(off-screen reading)
Westley didnt reach his
destination His ship was attacked
by the Dread Pirate Roberts who
never left captives alive When
Buttercup got the news that
Westley was murdered --

THE KID
(off-screen perking
up a little)
-- murdered by pirates is good --

CUT TO

CLOSE UP Buttercup staring out the window of her room

GRANDFATHER
(off-screen)
She went into her room and shut
the door And for days she
neither slept nor ate

BUTTERCUP
(no emotion at all in
her voice)
I will never love again

HOLD ON HER FACE perfect and perfectly sad
DISSOLVE TO
FLORIN CASTLE - DAY

The main courtyard of Florin replete with townspeople
livestock and a bustling marketplace

GRANDFATHER
(off-screen reading)
Five years later the main square
of Florin City was filled as
never before to hear the
announcement of the great Prince
Humperdincks bride-to be

CUT TO

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK a man of incredible power and bearing
standing in his royal robes on a castle balcony Three
others standing behind him an OLD COUPLE with crowns the
aging KING AND QUEEN and a dark bearded man who seems the
Princes match in strength this is COUNT RUGEN

HUMPERDINCK
(raises his hands
starts to speak)
My people a month from now
our country will have its 500th
anniversary On that sundown I
shall marry a lady who was once a

commoner like yourselves --
(pause)

-- but perhaps you will not find

her common now Would you like to

meet her

And the answering YESSSS booms like summer thunder

A giant staircase leading to the CROWD and as a FIGURE just
begins to become visible

CUT TO

THE CROWD as they see the figure (We havent yet) And if
there is such a thing as collective action then this crowd
collectively holds its breath

CUT TO

THE STAIRCASE as the figure appears in the archway It is
Buttercup And she resplendent

HUMPERDINCK
My people the Princess
Buttercup

She descends the stairs and starts to move amongst the people
CUT TO

THE CROWD and they do a very strange thing with no
instruction at all they suddenly go to their knees Great
waves of people kneeling and --

CUT TO

BUTTERCUP terribly moved She stands immobile among her
subjects blinking back tears HOLD on her beauty for a
moment

GRANDFATHER
(off-screen)
Buttercups emptiness consumed
her Although the law of the land
gave Humperdinck the right to
choose his bride she did not
love him

CUT TO

WOODLANDS
-- and Buttercup barreling along controlling her horse

easily
GRANDFATHER
(off-screen)

Despite Humperdincks reassurance

that she would grow to love him

the only joy she found was in her

daily ride

CUT TO

A WOODED GLEN - CLOSE TO SUNDOWN
Lovely quiet deserted Buttercup suddenly reins in

VOICE
A word my lady

CUT TO

THREE MEN standing close together in the path Beyond them
can be seen the waters of Florin Channel The three men are
not your everyday commuter types Standing in front is a
tiny man with the most angelic face He is Sicilian and his
name is VIZZINI Beside him is a Spaniard erect and taut as
a blade of steel His name is INIGO MONTOYA Beside him is a
giant His name is FEZZIK

VIZZINI
We are but poor lost circus
performers Is there a village

nearby

BUTTERCUP
There is nothing nearby not for
miles

VIZZINI

Then there will be no one to hear
you scream-

He nods to the giant Fezzik who merely reaches over
touches a nerve on Buttercups neck and the start of a
scream is all she manages --unconsciousness comes that fast
As she starts to fall --

CUT TO
A TINY ISOLATED SPOT AT THE EDGE OF FLORIN CHANNEL

A sailboat is moored Its dusk now shadows are long
Inigo the Spaniard busies himself getting the boat ready
CUT TO
The giant Fezzik carries Buttercup unconscious on board

Vizzini rips some tiny pieces of fabric from an army jacket
and tucks them along the saddle of Buttercups horse There
is about the entire operation a sense of tremendous skill
and precision

INIGO
What is that youre ripping

VIZZINI
(not stopping or turning)
Its fabric from the uniform of
an Army officer of Guilder

FEZZIK
Whos Guilder

VIZZINI
(pointing straight out)
The country across the sea The
sworn enemy of Florin
(slaps the horses rump)
Go

The horse takes off They start for the boat

VIZZINI

Once the horse reaches the
castle the fabric will make the
Prince suspect the Guilderians
have abducted his love When he
finds her body dead on the
Guilder frontier his suspicions
will be totally confirmed

FEZZIK
You never said anything about
killing anyone

Vizzini hops onto the boat

VIZZINI
Ive hired you to help me start a
war Thats a prestigious line of
work with a long and glorious
tradition

FEZZIK
I just dont think its right
killing an innocent girl
VIZZINI
(whirling on Fezzik
Am I going mad or did the word
think escape your lips You
were not hired for your brains
you hippopotamic land mass

INIGO
I agree with Fezzik

CLOSE UP Vizzini ina fury

VIZZINI
(We only thought he
was in a fury --now
hes really getting mad)
Oh The sot has spoken What
happens to her is not truly your

concern -- I will kill her --
(louder)

And remember this -- never forget

this --

CUT TO

INIGO AND FEZZIK as Vizzini advances on them Nothing shows
on Inigos face but FEZZIK is panicked by Vizzini

VIZZINI

(to Inigo)
-- when I found you you were so
slobbering drunk you couldnt buy
brandy --

(now to Fezzik who

retreats as much as he

can while Vizzini advances)
-- and you -- friendless
brainless helpless hopeless --
Do you want me to send you back
to where you were unemployed in
Greenland

Vizzini glares at him then turns leaves them

During this Inigo has gone close to FEZZIK who is very
distressed at the insults hes just received As Inigo casts
off

INIGO
(softly)
That Vizzini he can fuss
(a slight emphasis on
the last word)

FEZZIK
(looking at Inigo)
fuss fuss

(Suddenly hes got it
again emphasis on the
last word)

I think he likes to scream at us

INIGO
Probably he means no harm

FEZZIK
Hes really very short on charm

INIGO
(proudly)
Oh youve a great gift for rhyme

FEZZIK
Yes some of the time
(he starts to smile)

VIZZINI
(whirling on them)
Enough of that

As they sail off we hear their voices as the boat recedes

INIGO
FEZZIK are there rocks ahead

FEZZIK
If there are well all be dead

VIZZINI
No more rhymes now I mean it

FEZZIK
Anybody want a peanut

As Vizzini screams we

DISSOLVE TO
THE SAILBOAT RACING ACROSS THE DARK WATERS
Inigo is at the helm FEZZIK stands near the body of the

princess whose eyelids flutter slightly -- or do they
Vizzini sits motionless The waves are higher there are
only occasional flashes of moon slanting down between clouds

VIZZINI
(to Inigo)
Well reach the Cliffs by dawn

Inigo nods glances back

VIZZINI
Why are you doing that

INIGO
Making sure nobodys following us

VIZZINI
That would be inconceivable

BUTTERCUP
Despite what you think you will
be caught And when you are the
Prince will see you all hanged

Vizzini turns a cold eye on the Princess

VIZZINI
Of all the necks on this boat
Highness the one you should be
worrying about is your own

Inigo keeps staring behind them

VIZZINI
Stop doing that We can all
relax its almost over-

INIGO
Youre sure nobodys following us

VIZZINI
As I told you it would be
absolutely totally and in all
other ways inconceivable No one
in Guilder knows what weve done
And no one in Florin could have
gotten here so fast Out of
curiosity why do you ask

INIGO
No reason Its only I just
happened to look behind us and
something is there

VIZZINI
What
And suddenly the three whirl stare back and as they do --
CUT TO

THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM

Its hard to see the moon is behind clouds now But the
wind whistles And the waves pound

And suddenly its all gone ominous
CUT TO

INIGO FEZZIK AND VIZZINI squinting back trying desperately
to see At this moment they are all holding their breaths

CUT TO
THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM

And theres still nothing to be seen Its still ominous
Only now its eerie too

Then --

The moon slips through and --

Inigo was right -- something is very much there A sailboat
Black With a great billowing sail Black Its a good

distance behind them but its coming like hell closing the
gap

CUT TO
INIGO FEZZIK AND VIZZINI
staring at the other boat
VIZZINI
(explaining with as
much logic as he can muster)
Probably some local fisherman out
for a pleasure cruise at night
through eel-infested waters
And now as a sound comes from their boat they turn as we
CUT TO

BUTTERCUP diving into the water starting to swim away

CUT TO
THE BOAT
and Vizzini screaming

VIZZINI
Go in get after her

INIGO
I dont swim

FEZZIK
(to the unasked question)
I only dog paddle

VIZZINI
Veer left Left Left

CUT TO
BUTTERCUP

still close to the boat switching from a crawl to a silent
breast stroke The wind dies and as it does something new
is heard A not-too-distant high-pitched shrieking sound
Buttercup stops suddenly treads water

CUT TO
THE BOAT

VIZZINI
Do you know what that sound is
Highness Those are the Shrieking
Eels -- if you doubt me just
wait They always grow louder
when theyre about to feed on
human flesh

CUT TO

BUTTERCUP treading water still not far from the boat The
shrieking sounds are getting louder and more terrifying
Buttercup stays silent

CUT TO
THE BOAT

VIZZINI
If you swim back now I promise
no harm will come to you I doubt
you will get such an offer from
the Eels
CUT TO

BUTTERCUP and shes a gutsy girl The shrieking sound is
louder still but she doesnt make a sound Behind her now
something dark and gigantic slithers past

Shes scared sure petrified who wouldnt be but she
makes no reply --

-- and now a SHRIEKING EEL has zeroed in on her --

-- and now she sees it a short distance away circling
starting to close --

-- and Buttercup is frozen trying not to make a movement of
any kind --

-- and the Eel slithers closer closer --

-- and Buttercup knows it now theres nothing she can do
its over all over --

-- and now the Eel opens its mouth wide and its never made
such a noise and as its great jaws are about to clamp

down --

GRANDFATHER
(off-screen)
She doesnt get eaten by the Eels
at this time
And the second we hear him
CUT TO
THE SICK KIDS ROOM

The Kid looks the same pale and weak but maybe hes
gripping the sheets a little too tightly with his hands

THE KID
What

GRANDFATHER
The Eel doesnt get her Im
explaining to you because you
looked nervous

THE KID
Well I wasnt nervous

His Grandfather says nothing just waits

THE KID
Well maybe I was a little bit
concerned But thats not the
same thing

GRANDFATHER
Because I can stop now if you want

THE KID
No You could read a little bit
more if you want

He grips the sheets again as the Grandfather picks up the
book

GRANDFATHER
(reading)
Do you know what that sound is
Highness

CUT TO
VIZZINI
Were back in the boat
VIZZINI
Those are the Shrieking Eels
THE KID
(off-screen)
Were past that Grandpa
CUT TO
THE SICK KIDS ROOM
THE KID
You read it already
GRANDFATHER
Oh Oh my goodness I did Im
sorry Beg your pardon
CUT TO

BUTTERCUP
treading water

GRANDFATHER
(off-screen)
All right all right lets see
Uh she was in the water the Eel
was coming after her She was
frightened The Eel started to
charge her And then -

And were back where we were at the last moment we saw her

Buttercup frozen the Shrieking Eel jaws wide about to
clamp down as we

A GIANT ARM

pounding the Eel unconscious in one move then easily
lifting Buttercup

PULL BACK TO REVEAL
The boat and FEZZIK Buttercup being deposited on the deck

VIZZINI
Put her down Just put her down

CUT TO
INIGO
pointing behind them

INIGO
I think hes getting closer

Vizzini tying Buttercups hands

VIZZINI
Hes no concern of ours Sail on
(to Buttercup)
I suppose you think youre brave
dont you

BUTTERCUP
(staring deep at him)
Only compared to some

DISSOLVE TO

The boat at dawn being followed closely by the black
sailboat which we can see for the first time is being
sailed by a MAN IN BLACK and his boat almost seems to be
flying

INIGO
Look Hes right on top of us I
wonder if he is using the same
wind we are using
VIZZINI
Whoever he is hes too late --
(pointing ahead of them)
-- see
(big)
The Cliffs of Insanity

And once hes said the name--
CUT TO

THE CLIFFS OF INSANITY - DAWN

They rise straight up sheer from the water impossibly high
CUT TO

THE TWO SAILBOATS

in a wild race for the Cliffs and the Man In Black is
closing faster than ever but not fast enough the lead was
too great to overcome and as Inigo sails with great
precision straight at the Cliffs

CUT TO
THE BOAT

being pursued

VIZZINI

Hurry up Move the thing Um
that other thing Move it

(staring back now)
Were safe -- only FEZZIK is
strong enough to go up our way --
hell have to sail around for
hours til he finds a harbor

There is much activity going on all of it swift expert
economical FEZZIK reaches up along the Cliff face grabs a
jutting rock reaches behind it Suddenly there is a thick
rope in his hands He drops back to the boat gives the rope
a freeing swing and

CUT TO
THE CLIFFS
The rope goes all the way to the top

CUT TO

INIGO
hurrying to FEZZIK He straps a harness to him then lifts
Buttercup and Vizzini in the harness Finally he himself
gets in the harness All three are strapped to FEZZIK like
papooses

And he starts to ascend the rope carrying them all along
with him as he goes

CUT TO

THE MAN IN BLACK sailing in toward the Cliffs of Insanity
watching as FEZZIK rises swiftly through the first moments
of dawn

CUT TO
THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS - LOOKING DOWN

FEZZIKS GROUP is only faintly visible far below This is
the first time weve gotten the real vertigo feeling and
its a gasper

CUT TO

FEZZIK CLIMBING ON Buttercup is almost out of her mind with
fear

CUT TO
THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE CLIFFS

FEZZIK is moving right along however high they are hes
already over a third of the way done

CUT TO
THE MAN IN BLACK

leaping from his ship to the rope starting to climb Hes
impossibly far behind but the way he goes youd think he
didnt know that because he is flying up the rope hand over
hand like lightning

CUT TO
VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS
INIGO
(looking down)
Hes climbing the rope And hes

gaining on us

VIZZINI
Inconceivable

He prods FEZZIK who nods increases his pace

CUT TO

THE MAN IN BLACK
roaring up the rope and

CUT TO

LONG SHOT - THE CLIFFS

-- and the Man In Black is cutting deeply into FEZZIKs lead
CUT TO

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS

VIZZINI
(shrieking)
Faster

FEZZIK
I thought I was going faster

VIZZINI
You were supposed to be this
colossus You were this great
legendary thing And yet he gains

FEZZIK
Well Im carrying three people
And hes got only himself

VIZZINI
(cutting through)
-- I do not accept excuses
(shaking his head)
Im just going to have to find
myself a new giant thats all

FEZZIK
(hurt)
Dont say that Vizzini Please
And his arms begin moving much more slowly
CUT TO

THE MAN IN BLACK

His arms still work as before If anything he has speeded
up FEZZIKs lead is smaller and smaller

CUT TO

THE VIEW FROM THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS
Maybe a hundred feet for FEZZIK to go Maybe more
CUT TO
VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS and its getting too close now
VIZZINI
Did I make it clear that your job
is at stake
CUT TO
THE MAN IN BLACK
less than a hundred feet behind them And gaining
CUT TO
THE CLIFF TOP AS FEZZIK MAKES IT
Vizzini leaps off and takes out a knife begins to cut the
rope which is tied around a great rock while Inigo helps the
Princess to her feet and FEZZIK just stands around waiting
for someone to tell him to do something Nearby are some

stone ruins Once they might have been a fort now the kind
of resemble Stonehenge

CUT TO
THE MAN IN BLACK
feet from the top now maybe less -- maybe only 50 -- and
his pace is as dazzling as before and

CUT TO
VIZZINI
cutting through the last of the rope and

CUT TO

THE ROPE

slithering across the ground and out of sight toward the
Channel like some great serpent at last going home

CUT TO
FEZZIK

standing with Inigo and Buttercup by the cliff edge

FEZZIK
(to Inigo -- impressed)
He has very good arms
CUT TO
THE MAN IN BLACK

hanging suspended hundreds of feet in the air holding to
the jagged rocks desperately trying to cling to life

CUT TO
VIZZINI
stunned turning to the others looking down

VIZZINI
He didnt fall Inconceivable

INIGO
(whirling on Vizzini)
You keep using that word -- I do
not think it means what you think

it means
(looks down again)
My God Hes climbing

CUT TO
THE MAN IN BLACK

and so he is Very slowly he is picking his way upwards
sometimes a foot at a time sometimes an inch

CUT TO
The group at the top staring down

VIZZINI

Whoever he is hes obviously
seen us with the Princess and
must therefore die

(to Fezzik)
You carry her

(to Inigo)
Well head straight for the
Guilder frontier Catch up when
hes dead If he falls fine If
not the sword

Inigo nods

INIGO
I want to duel him left-handed

VIZZINI
You know what a hurry were in

INIGO
Well its the only way I can be
satisfied If I use my right --
tch -- over too quickly

VIZZINI
(turns abruptly
starts off-screen)
Oh have it your way

CUT TO
THE MAN IN BLACK
still creeping his way upward
CUT TO
FEZZIK
who goes to Inigo
FEZZIK
You be careful
(gravely)
-- people in masks cannot be
trusted
VIZZINI
(calling out)
Im waiting
FEZZIK nods hurries after Vizzini
CUT TO

INIGO

He watches them depart then turns peers down over the
Cliffs He watches a moment then paces shaking his hands
loose He practices a few of his honed fencing skills He is
a taut and nervous fellow and has never been one for
waiting around
CUT TO

THE MAN IN BLACK

climbing on He must be six inches closer to the top than
when last we saw him Inigo is watching

CUT TO

INIGO

walking away Finally he goes back to cliff edge starts to
talk Its instant death if the Man In Black falls but
neither gives that possibility much credence This is our
two heroes meeting They dont know it yet but thats what
it is

INIGO
(hollering down)
Hello there

The Man In Black glances up kind of grunts

INIGO
Slow going

MAN IN BLACK
Look I dont mean to be rude
but this is not as easy as it
looks So Id appreciate it if
you wouldnt distract me

INIGO
Sorry

MAN IN BLACK
Thank you

Inigo steps away draws his sword loosens up with a few
perfect thrusts Then resheathes and looks eagerly over the
edge again

INIGO
I do not suppose you could speed
things up

MAN IN BLACK
(with some beat)
If youre in such a hurry you
could lower a rope or a tree
branch or find something useful
to do
INIGO
I could do that In fact Ive
got some rope up here But I do
not think that you will accept my
help since I am only waiting
around to kill you

MAN IN BLACK
That does put a damper on our
relationship

He finds another bold a few inches higher

INIGO
But I promise I will not kill you
until you reach the top

MAN IN BLACK
Thats very comforting But Im
afraid youll just have to wait

INIGO
I hate waiting I could give you
my word as a Spaniard

MAN IN BLACK
No good Ive known too many
Spaniards

And he just hangs there in space resting gathering his
strength

INIGO
You dont know any way youll
trust me

MAN IN BLACK
Nothing comes to mind

And on these words CAMERA ZOOMS into a CLOSE UP on Inigo
He raises his right hand high his eyes blaze and his voice
takes on a tone we have not heard before

INIGO
I swear on the soul of my father
Domingo Montoya you will reach
the top alive

CUT TO
THE MAN IN BLACK

There is a pause Then quietly
MAN IN BLACK
Throw me the rope

CUT TO

INIGO

He dashes to the giant rock the rope was originally tied to
CUT TO

THE MAN IN BLACK

as his grip loosens a moment trying to cling to the side of
the cliff

CUT TO
INIGO

now with a small coil of rope hurries back to the edge and
hurls it over --

CUT TO
THE ROPE
It hangs close to the Man In Black He releases the rocks
grabs the rope hangs helplessly in space a moment then
looks up at Inigo and --
CUT TO
INIGO
straining forcing his body away from the cliff edge and --
CUT TO

THE MAN IN BLACK

rising through the early morning light slowly steadily
and as the cliff top at last comes within reach --

CUT TO
INIGO

watching as the Man In Black crawls to safety then looks to
Inigo

MAN IN BLACK
(pulling his sword)
Thank you
INIGO
Well wait until youre ready

MAN IN BLACK
Again Thank you

The Man In Black sits to rest on the boulder that once held
the rope He tugs off his leather boots and is amazed to see
several large rocks tumble out The Man In Black wears
gloves Inigo stares at them

INIGO
I do not mean to pry but you
dont by any chance happen to
have six fingers on your right
hand

He glances up -- the question clearly baffles him

MAN IN BLACK
Do you always begin conversations
this way

INIGO
My father was slaughtered by a
sixfingered man He was a great
swordmaker my father And when
the six-fingered man appeared and
requested a special sword my
father took the job He slaved a
year before he was done

He hands his sword to the Man In Black

MAN IN BLACK
(fondling it-impressed)
I have never seen its equal

CUT TO
CLOSE UP - INIGO
Even now this still brings pain

INIGO

The six-fingered man returned and
demanded it but at one-tenth his
promised price My father refused
Without a word the six-fingered
man slashed him through the heart
I loved my father so naturally
challenged his murderer to a duel
I failed
INIGO (CONTD)
the six-fingered man did leave me
alive with the six-fingered
sword but he gave me these

He touches his scars

CUT TO
THE MAN IN BLACK
looking up at Inigo

MAN IN BLACK
How old were you

INIGO
I was eleven years old When I
was strong enough I dedicated my
life to the study of fencing So
the next time we meet I will not
fail I will go up to the
sixfingered man and say Hello
my name is Inigo Montoya You
killed my father Prepare to die

MAN IN BLACK
Youve done nothing but study
swordplay

INIGO
More pursuit than study lately
You see I cannot find him Its
been twenty years now I am
starting to lose confidence I
just work for Vizzini to pay the
bills Theres not a lot of money
in revenge

MAN IN BLACK
(handing back the
great sword starting
to rise)
Well I certainly hope you find
him someday

INIGO
You are ready then

MAN IN BLACK
Whether I am or not youve been
more than fair
INIGO
You seem a decent fellow I hate
to kill you

MAN IN BLACK
(walking away a few
paces unsheathing his sword)
You seem a decent fellow I hate
to die

INIGO
Begin

And on that word --
CUT TO
THE TWO OF THEM

And what we are starting now is one of the two greatest
sword fights in modern movies (the other one happens later
on) and right from the beginning it looks different

Because they arent close to each other -- none of the
swordscrossing en garde garbage

No what we have here is two men two athletes and they
look to be too faraway to damage each other but each time
one makes even the tiniest feint the other counters and
there is silence and as they start to circle --

CUT TO
THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD
feinting here feinting there and --
CUT TO
THE TWO MEN
finished teasing begin to duel in earnest
Their swords cross then again again and the sound comes
so fast its almost continual Inigo presses on the Man In

Black retreating up a rocky incline

INIGO
(thrilled)
Youre using Bonettis defense
against me ah
MAN IN BLACK
I thought it fitting considering
the rocky terrain --

INIGO
Naturally you must expect me to
attack with Capo Ferro

And he shifts his style now

MAN IN BLACK
(coping as best he can)
-- naturally --
(suddenly shifting again)
--but I find Thibault cancels out
Capo Ferro dont you

The Man In Black is now perched at the edge of the elevated
castle ruin No where to go he jumps to the sand

Inigo stares down at him

INIGO
Unless the enemy has studied his
Agrippa-

And now with the grace of an Olympian Inigo flies off the
perch somersaults clean over the Man In Blacks head and
lands facing his opponent

INIGO
-- which I have

The two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain
never losing balance never coming close to stumbling the
battle rages with incredible finesse first one and then the
other gaining the advantage and by now its clear that
this isnt just two athletes going at it its a lot more
that that This is two legendary swashbucklers and theyre
in their prime its Burt Lancaster in The Crimson Pirate
battling Errol Flynn in Robin Hood and then incredibly
the action begins going even faster than before as we

CUT TO
INIGO

And behind him now drawing closer all the time is the
deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity Inigo fights and
ducks and feints and slashes and it all works but not for
long as gradually the Man In Black keeps the advantage
keeps forcing Inigo back closer and closer to death
INIGO
(happy as a clam)
You are wonderful

MAN IN BLACK
Thank you -- Ive worked hard to
become so

The Cliff edge is very close now Inigo is continually being
forced toward it

INIGO
I admit it -- you are better than
I am

MAN IN BLACK
Then why are you smiling

Inches from defeat Inigo is in fact all smiles

INIGO
Because I know something you
dont know

MAN IN BLACK
And what is that

INIGO
I am not left-handed

And he throws the six-fingered sword into his right hand and
immediately the tide of battle turns

CUT TO
THE MAN IN BLACK
stunned doing everything be can to keep Inigo by the Cliff
edge But no use Slowly at first he begins to retreat Now
faster Inigo is in control and the Man In Black is desperate
CUT TO

INIGO

and the six-fingered sword is all but invisible now as he
increases his attack then suddenly switches styles again

A ROCKY STAIRCASE leading to a turret-shaped plateau and
the Man In Black is retreating like mad up the steps and he
cant stop Inigo -- nothing can stop Inigo -- and ina
frenzy the Man In Black makes every feint tries every
thrust lets go with all he has left But he fails
Everything fails He tries one or two final desperate moves
but they are nothing

MAN IN BLACK
Youre amazing

INIGO
I ought to be after twenty years

And now the Man In Black is smashed into a stone pillar
pinned there under the six fingered sword

MAN IN BLACK
(hollering it out)
Theres something I ought to tell
you

INIGO
Tell me

MAN IN BLACK
I am not left-handed either

And now he changes hands and at last the battle is fully
joined

CUT TO
INIGO

And to his amazement he is being forced back down the steps
He tries one style another but it all comes down to the
same thing -- the Man In Black seems to be in control And
before Inigo knows it the six-fingered sword is knocked
clear out of his hand

Inigo retreats dives from the stairs to a moss-covered bar
suspended over the archway He swings out lands and
scrambles to his sword and we

CUT TO

THE MAN IN BLACK

who watches Inigo then casually tosses his sword to the
landing where it sticks in perfectly Then the Man In Black
copies INIGO Not copies exactly improves

He dives to the bar swings completely over it like a circus
performer and dismounts with a backflip

CUT TO
INIGO
staring in awe

INIGO
Who are you

MAN IN BLACK
No one of consequence

INIGO
I must know

MAN IN BLACK
Get used to disappointment

INIGO
Okay

CUT TO
INIGO

moving like lightning and he thrusts forward slashes
darts back all in almost a single movement and --

CUT TO
THE MAN IN BLACK

Dodging blocking and again he thrusts forward faster even
than before and again he slashes but --

CUT TO
INIGO
And there is never a move anyone makes he doesnt remember
and this time he blocks the slash slashes out himself with
the sixfingered sword
On it goes back and forth across the rocky terrain Inigos

feet moving with the grace and speed of a great
improvisational dancer

THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD
as it is knocked free arching up into the air and --

CUT TO
INIGO

catching it again And something terrible is written behind
his eyes he has given his all done everything man can do
tried every style made every maneuver but it wasnt
enough and on his face for all to see is the realization
that he Inigo Montoya of Spain is going to lose

CUT TO
THE MAN IN BLACK

moving in for the end now blocking everything muzzling
everything and

CUT TO
THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

sent flying from Inigos grip He stands helpless only a
moment Then be drops to his knees bows his head shuts his
eyes

INIGO
Kill me quickly

MAN IN BLACK
I would as soon destroy a stained
glass window as an artist like
yourself However since I cant
have you following me either --

And he dunks Inigos head with his heavy sword handle Inigo
pitches forward unconscious

MAN IN BLACK
Please understand I hold you in
the highest respect

He grabs his scabbard and takes off after the Princess and we
CUT TO
CLOSE UP VIZZINI

VIZZINI
Inconceivable

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Vizzini staring down from a narrow mountain path as far
below the Man In Black can be seen running FEZZIK carrying
the Princess stands alongside Its a little later in the
morning
VIZZINI
Give her to me
(grabs Buttercup
starts off)
Catch up with us quickly

FEZZIK
(starting to panic)
What do I do

VIZZINI
Finish him finish him Your way

FEZZIK
Oh good my way Thank you
Vizzini
(little pause)
Which way is my way

CUT TO
A COUPLE OF ROCKS

Nothing gigantic Vizzini points to them There is a large
boulder nearby

VIZZINI
Pick up one of those rocks get
behind the boulder and in a few
minutes the Man in Black will
come running around the bend The
minute his head is in view hit
it with the rock

As Vizzini and Buttercup hurry away

FEZZIK
(little frown softly)
My ways not very sportsmanlike

He grabs one of the rocks and plods behind the boulder and
we --

DISSOLVE TO

THE MAN IN BLACK

racing up the mountain trail Ahead is a bend in the trail
He sees it slows Then he stops listening

Satisfied by the silence he starts forward again and as he
rounds the bend -- a rock flies INTO FRAME shattering on a
boulder inches in front of him
CUT TO

FEZZIK

He moves into the mountain path He has picked up another
rock and holds it lightly

FEZZIK
I did that on purpose I dont
have to miss

MAN IN BLACK
I believe you -- So what happens
now

FEZZIK
We face each other as God intended
Sportsmanlike No tricks no
weapons skill against skill alone

MAN IN BLACK
You mean youll put down your
rock and Ill put down my sword
and well try to kill each other
like civilized people

FEZZIK
(gently)
I could kill you now

He gets set to throw but the Man In Black shakes his head
takes off his sword and scabbard begins the approach toward
the Giant

MAN IN BLACK
Frankly I think the odds are
slightly in your favor at hand
fighting

FEZZIK
Its not my fault being the
biggest and the strongest I
dont even exercise

He flips the rock away
CUT TO
THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND THE TWO MEN
The Man In Black is not now and has never been a shrimp But

its like he wasnt even there FEZZIK towers over him so
much
There is a moments pause and then the Man In Black dives
at FEZZIKs chest slams him several tremendous blows in the
stomach twists his arm severely slips skillfully into a
beautifully applied bear hug and in general makes any
number of terrific wrestling moves

FEZZIK just stands there kind of taking in the scenery
Finally the Man In Black pushes himself away stares up at
the Giant

MAN IN BLACK
Look are you just fiddling around
with me or what

FEZZIK
I just want you to feel youre
doing well I hate for people to
die embarrassed

They get set to begin again Then suddenly --
CUT TO
FEZZIK

as he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size
and reaches for the Man In Black who drops to his knees
spins loose and slips between the Giants legs

FEZZIK
Youre quick

MAN IN BLACK
And a good thing too

FEZZIK
(getting set for
another onslaught)
Why do you wear a mask Were you
burned by acid or something like
that

MAN IN BLACK
Oh no Its just that theyre
terribly comfortable I think
everyone will be wearing them in
the future

FEZZIK considers this a moment then attacks and if he
moved quickly last time this time he is blinding and as the
Man In Black slips down to avoid the charge FEZZIK moves
right with him only instead of twisting free and jumping to
his feet this time the Man In Black jumps for FEZZIKs back
and in a moment he is riding him and his arms have FEZZIKs
throat locked across FEZZIKs windpipe one in front one
behind The Man In Black begins to squeeze Tighter

FEZZIK
(standing talking as
he does so)
I just figured out why you give
me so much trouble

CUT TO

FEZZIK

as he charges toward a huge rock that lines the path and
just as he reaches it he spins his giant body so that the
entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black

CUT TO
THE MAN IN BLACK

And the power of the charge is terrible the pain enormous
but he clings to his grip at FEZZIKs windpipe

MAN IN BLACK
(his arms never leave
Fezziks throat)
Why is that do you think

FEZZIK

(his voice just

beginning to get a

little strained)
Well I havent fought just one
person for so long Ive been
specializing in groups Battling
gangs for local charities that
kind of thing

ANOTHER HUGE ROCK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PATH
Again FEZZIK charges slower this time but still a charge
and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the
rough boulder

CUT TO
THE MAN IN BLACK

And the punishment is terrible and for a moment it seems as
if he is going to let go of Fezziks windpipe and crumble
but he doesnt he holds on

MAN IN BLACK
Why should that make such a
difference

FEZZIK

Well

(And now his voice is

definitely growing weaker)
- you see you use different
moves when youre fighting half a
dozen people than when you only
have to be worried about one

Again FEZZIK slams the Man In Black against a boulder only
this time his power has diminished and Fezzik starts to
slowly collapse

CUT TO
FEZZIK
and there isnt much breath coming

CUT TO
THE MAN IN BLACK

holding his grip as FEZZIK tries to stand halfway makes it
but there is no air Back to his knees he falls holds there
for a moment and pitches down to all fours The Man In
Black increases the pressure FEZZIK tries to crawl But
there is just no air No air FEZZIK goes to earth and lies
still

CUT TO

FEZZIK

as the Man In Black turns him over puts his ear to FEZZIKs
heart It beats The Man In Black stands

MAN IN BLACK
I dont envy you the headache you
will have when you awake But in
the meantime rest well and
dream of large women

And he nimbly scoops up his sword with his foot catches it
and as he dashes off up along the mountain path --

CUT TO
PRINCE HUMPERDINCK
as he slips his boot into a foot print in the sand

Count Rugen mounted watches Behind him half a dozen armed
WARRIORS also mounted A GREAT WHITE HORSE waits riderless
in front Humperdinck is all over the rocky ground and
maybe he isnt the best hunter in the world Then again
maybe he is Because as he begins to put his feet into
strange positions we realize that what he is doing is
miming the fencers

HUMPERDINCK
There was a mighty duel -- it
ranged all over They were both
masters

RUGEN

Who won How did it end

HUMPERDINCK
(looking down in the
position where Inigo
fell unconscious)
The loser ran off alone
(points in the
direction Vizzini and
FEZZIK took)
The winner followed those
footprints toward Guilder

RUGEN
Shall we track them both

HUMPERDINCK
The loser is nothing -- Only the
Princess matters --

(to the armed warriors
-- clearly this was all planned
by warriors of Guilder We must
be ready for whatever lies ahead

RUGEN
Could this be a trap

HUMPERDINCK
(vaulting onto his horse)
I always think everything could
be a trap -- Which is why Im
still alive

And he gallops off --

CUT TO
THE MAN IN BLACK
cresting the peak of the mountain

CUT TO
CLOSE-UP ON

a knife pointed at a throat -- PULL BACK TO REVEAL Vizzini
munching on an apple holding the knife to Buttercups
throat She is blindfolded

A PICNIC SPREAD is laid out A tablecloth two goblets and
between them a small leather wine container And some
cheese and a couple of apples The picnic is set on a lovely
spot high on the edge of a mountain path with a view all
the way back to the sea

The Man In Black comes running around the path sees Vizzini
slows The two men study each other Then --

VIZZINI
So it is down to you And it is
down to me

The Man In Black nods and comes nearer --

VIZZINI
If you wish her dead by all
means keep moving forward

And he pushes his long knife harder against Buttercups
unprotected throat

MAN IN BLACK
Let me explain-

VIZZINI
-- theres nothing to explain
Youre trying to kidnap what Ive
rightfully stolen

MAN IN BLACK
Perhaps an arrangement can be
reached

VIZZINI
There will be no arrangement --
(deliberate)
-- and youre killing her

CUT TO
BUTTERCUPS THROAT

as Vizzini jabs with his long knife Buttercup gasps against
the pain

CUT TO
THE MAN IN BLACK
stopping fast
MAN IN BLACK
But if there can be no
arrangement then we are at an
impasse
VIZZINI
Im afraid so -- I cant compete

with you physically And youre
no match for my brains

MAN IN BLACK
Youre that smart

VIZZINI
Let me put it this way have you
ever heard of Plato Aristotle
Socrates

MAN IN BLACK
Yes

VIZZINI
Morons

MAN IN BLACK
Really In that case I challenge
you to a battle of wits

VIZZINI
For the Princess

The Man In Black nods

VIZZINI
To the death

Another nod

VIZZINI
I accept

MAN IN BLACK
Good Then pour the wine
As Vizzini fills the goblets with the dark red liquid the
Man In Black pulls a small packet from his clothing handing
it to Vizzini

MAN IN BLACK
Inhale this but do not touch

VIZZINI
(doing it)
I smell nothing

MAN IN BLACK
(taking the packet back)
What you do not smell is called
iocane powder It is odorless
tasteless dissolves instantly in
liquid and is among the more
deadlier poisons known to man

VIZZINI
Hmm

CUT TO

VIZZINI

watching excitedly as the Man In Black takes the goblets
turns his back A moment later he turns again faces
Vizzini drops the iocane packet It is now empty

The Man In Black rotates the goblets in a little shell game
maneuver then puts one glass in front of Vizzini the other
in front of himself

MAN IN BLACK
All right where is the poison
The battle of wits has begun It
ends when you decide and we both
drink and find out who is right
and who is dead

VIZZINI
But its so simple All I have to
do is divine from what I know of
you Are you the sort of man who
would put the poison into his own
goblet or his enemys

He studies the Man In Black now
VIZZINI

Now a clever man would put the
poison into his own goblet
because he would know that only a
great fool would reach for what
he was given Im not a great
fool so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of you But you
must have known I was not a great
fool you would have counted on
it so I can clearly not choose
the wine in front of me

MAN IN BLACK
(And now theres a
trace of nervousness beginning)
Youve made your decision then7

VIZZINI
Not remotely Because iocane
comes from Australia as everyone
knows And Australia is entirely
peopled with criminals And
criminals are used to having
people not trust them as you are
not trusted by me So I can
clearly not choose the wine in
front of you

MAN IN BLACK
Truly you have a dizzying
intellect

VIZZINI
Wait till I get going Where was I

MAN IN BLACK
Australia

VIZZINI
Yes -- Australia and you must
have suspected I would have known
the powders origin so I can
clearly not choose the wine in
front of me

MAN IN BLACK
(very nervous)
Youre just stalling now

VIZZINI
(cackling)
Youd like to think that wouldnt
you
(stares at the Man in Black)
Youve beaten my giant which
means youre exceptionally strong
So you could have put the poison
in your own goblet trusting on
your strength to save you So I
can clearly not choose the wine
in front of you But youve also
bested my Spaniard which means
you must have studied And in
studying you must have learned
that man is mortal so you would
have put the poison as far from
yourself as possible so I can
clearly not choose the wine in
front of me

As Vizzinis pleasure has been growing throughout the Man
In Blacks has been fast disappearing

MAN IN BLACK
Youre trying to trick me into
giving away something -- it wont
work --
VIZZINI
(triumphant)
It has worked -- youve given
everything away -- I know where
the poison is
MAN IN BLACK
(fools courage)
Then make your choice

VIZZINI
I will And I choose --

And suddenly he stops points at something behind the Man In
Black

VIZZINI
-- what in the world can that be

THE MAN IN BLACK
turning around looking

MAN IN BLACK
What Where I dont see anything

CUT TO

VIZZINI
busily switching the goblets while the Man In Black has his
head turned

VIZZINI
Oh well I-I could have sworn I
saw something No matter

The Man In Black turns to face him again Vizzini starts to
laugh

MAN IN BLACK
Whats so funny

VIZZINI
Ill tell you in a minute First
lets drink -- me from my glass

and you from yours

And he picks up his goblet The Man In Black picks up the
one in front of him As they both start to drink Vizzini
hesitates a moment

Then allowing the Man In Black to drink first he swallows
his wine

MAN IN BLACK
You guessed wrong

VIZZINI
(roaring with laughter)
You only think I guessed wrong --
(louder now)
-- thats whats so funny I
switched glasses when your back
was turned You fool

CUT TO
THE MAN IN BLACK

Theres nothing he can say He just sits there

VIZZINI
watching him

VIZZINI
You fell victim to one of the
classic blunders The most famous
is Never get involved in a land
war in Asia But only slightly
less well known is this Never
go in against a Sicilian when
death is on the line

He laughs and roars and cackles and whoops and is in all
ways quite cheery until he falls over dead

CUT TO

THE MAN IN BLACK

stepping past the corpse taking the blindfold and bindings
off Buttercup who notices Vizzini lying dead

The Man In Black pulls her to her feet

BUTTERCUP
Who are you

MAN IN BLACK
I am no one to be trifled with
that is all you ever need know

He starts to lead her off the mountain path into untraveled
terrain

BUTTERCUP
(a final glance back
toward Vizzini)
To think -- all that time it was
your cup that was poisoned

MAN IN BLACK
They were both poisoned I spent
the last few years building up an
immunity to iocane powder

And with that he takes off dragging her behind him

A MOUNTAIN PATH

Its where FEZZIK fought the Man in Black CAMERA PULLS BACK
TO REVEAL the Prince kneeling inspecting every grain of
misplaced sand The others wait behind him

HUMPERDINCK
Someone has beaten a giant
(roaring)
There will be great suffering in
Guilder if she dies

He leaps onto his horse and they charge off
CUT TO
A WILD STRETCH OF TERRAIN

The Man In Black comes running into view still dragging
Buttercup who sometimes stumbles but he keeps forcing her
along Finally when she is close to exhaustion he lets go
of her

MAN IN BLACK
(his voice harsh now
carrying the promise
of violence)
Catch your breath

BUTTERCUP
If youll release me whatever
you ask for ransom youll get

it I promise you

MAN IN BLACK
And what is that worth the
promise of a woman Youre very
funny Highness

BUTTERCUP
I was giving you a chance No
matter where you take me
theres no greater hunter than
Prince Humperdinck He could
track a falcon on a cloudy day
He can find you

MAN IN BLACK
You think your dearest love will
save you

BUTTERCUP
I never said he was my dearest
love And yes he will save me
That I know

MAN IN BLACK
You admit to me you do not love
your fiance

BUTTERCUP
He knows I do not love him

MAN IN BLACK
Are not capable of love is what
you mean

BUTTERCUP
I have loved more deeply than a
killer like yourself could ever
dream

And the Man In Black cocks back a fist Buttercup flinches
but does not retreat

MAN IN BLACK
That was a warning Highness The
next time my hand flies on its
own For where I come from there
are penalties when a woman lies

CUT TO

VIZZINIS BODY
The picnic is spread as before

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Prince kneeling by the body
as the others ride up The Prince grabs the empty poison
packet hands it to Rugen after first sniffing it himself

HUMPERDINCK

Iocane Id bet my life on it

(gestures to the trail ahead)
And there are the Princesss
footprints She is alive or
was an hour ago If she is
otherwise when I find her I
shall be very put out

And as he vaults onto his horse and the all charge off --

BUTTERCUP

being spun INTO CAMERA view falling heavily as the Man In
Black releases her We are at the edge of an almost sheer
ravine The drop is sharp and severe Below the ravine
floor is flat but getting there would not be half the fun

MAN IN BLACK
Rest Highness

BUTTERCUP
(stares at him)
I know who you are -- your
cruelty reveals everything

The Man In Black says nothing

BUTTERCUP
Youre the Dread Pirate Roberts
admit it

MAN IN BLACK
(bowing)
With pride What can I do for you

BUTTERCUP
You can die slowly cut into a
thousand pieces

MAN IN BLACK
Hardly complimentary Your
Highness Why loose your venom on
me

CLOSE UP - BUTTERCUP quietly now

BUTTERCUP
You killed my love

CUT TO
THE MAN IN BLACK

watching her closely

MAN IN BLACK
Its possible I kill a lot of
people Who was this love of
yours Another Prince like this
one ugly rich and scabby

BUTTERCUP
No A farm boy Poor Poor and
perfect with eyes like the sea
after a storm
CUT TO
BUTTERCUP

And probably if she did not hate Roberts so there would be
tears

BUTTERCUP
On the high seas your ship
attacked and the Dread Pirate
Roberts never takes prisoners

MAN IN BLACK
(explaining as a
teacher might)
I cant afford to make exceptions
Once word leaks out that a pirate
has gone soft people begin to
disobey you and then its
nothing but work work work all
the time

BUTTERCUP
You mock my pain

MAN IN BLACK
Life is pain Highness Anyone
who says differently is selling
something I remember this farm
boy of yours I think This would
be what five years ago

Buttercup nods

MAN IN BLACK
Does it bother you to hear

BUTTERCUP
Nothing you can say will upset me

MAN IN BLACK
He died well that should please
you No bribe attempts or
blubbering He simply said
Please Please I need to live
It was the please that caught
my memory

MAN IN BLACK (CONTD)
I asked him what was so important
for him True love he replied
And then he spoke of a girl of
surpassing beauty and faithfulness
I can only assume he meant you
You should bless me for destroying
him before he found out what you
really are

BUTTERCUP
And what am I

MAN IN BLACK
Faithfulness he talked of madam
Your enduring faithfulness Now
tell me truly When you found out
he was gone did you get engaged
to your prince that same hour or
did you wait a whole week out of
respect for the dead
BUTTERCUP

You mocked me once never do it

again -- I died that day
The Man In Black is about to reply as they stand there on
the edge of the sheer ravine But then something catches his
attention and as he stares at it briefly

CUT TO

HIS POV

The dust cloud caused by Humperdincks HORSES is rising up
into the sky

CUT TO
BUTTERCUP

and while his attention is on the dust cloud rising high
she pushes him with all the strength she has

BUTTERCUP
You can die too for all I care

CUT TO
THE MAN IN BLACK

teetering on the ravine edge for a moment then he begins
to fall Down goes the Man In Black

Down down rolling spinning crashing always down toward
the flat rock floor of the ravine

CUT TO
BUTTERCUP
staring transfixed at what she has wrought

There is a long pause She stands there alone as from far
below the words come to her drifting on the wind --

MAN IN BLACK

aS you wish
BUTTERCUP

Oh my sweet Westley what have I

done

And without a second thought or consideration of the dangers
she starts into the ravine A moment later she too is
falling spinning and twisting crashing and torn
cartwheeling down toward what is left of her beloved

CUT TO
THE DUST CLOUD
rising
PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Prince Humperdinck and the others reining in at the spot
where Buttercup promised ransom in exchange for her freedom
The Prince shakes his head

HUMPERDINCK
Disappeared He must have seen us
closing in which might account
for his panicking in error
Unless Im wrong and I am never
wrong they are headed dead into
the fire swamp

CUT TO
COUNT RUGEN

The mere mention of the Fire Swamp makes him pale

THE RAVINE FLOOR

TWO BODIES lie a few feet apart not moving It is of
course Buttercup and Westley They might be corpses After
a time Westley slowly forces his body into motion and as he
does

CUT TO
BUTTERCUP
bruised and torn as Westley crawls slowly toward her

WESTLEY
Can you move at all

BUTTERCUP
(weakly stretching out
an arm toward him)
Move Youre alive If you want
I can fly

WESTLEY
I told you I would always come
for you Why didnt you wait for

me
BUTTERCUP
Well you were dead
WESTLEY

Death cannot stop true love All
it can do is delay it for a while

BUTTERCUP
I will never doubt again

WESTLEY
There will never be a need

And now they begin to kiss its a tender kiss tender and
loving and gentle and --

THE KID
(off-screen)
Oh no No please

CUT TO
THE KIDS BEDROOM

GRANDFATHER
What is it Whats the matter

THE KID
Theyre kissing again do we have
to hear the kissing part

GRANDFATHER
Someday you may not mind so much

THE KID
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that
sounded good

GRANDFATHER
Oh Youre sick Ill humor you
(he picks up the book again)
So now where were we here Yeah
yeah yeah Ah Oh Okay Westley
and Buttercup raced along the
ravine floor

CUT TO

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP
racing along the ravine floor Westley glances up
CUT TO
HUMPERDINCK AND HIS MEN

perched on top of the cliff looking down at Westley and

Buttercup
CUT TO
WESTLEY
WESTLEY
Ha Your pig fiance is too late
A few more steps and well be
safe in the Fire Swamp
CUT TO
BUTTERCUP

and Westley has tried to say it with Chevalier-like
nonchalance but she aint buying

BUTTERCUP
Well never survive

WESTLEY
Nonsense -- youre only saying
that because no one ever has

As they race off leaving Humperdinck and his men stranded
defeated

CUT TO

THE FIRE SWAMP

And it really doesnt look any worse than any other moist
sulphurous infernal horror you might run across Great
trees block the sun

CUT TO
WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

Buttercup is clearly panicked and maybe Westley is too but
he moves jauntily along sword in hand

WESTLEY
Its not that bad Im not saying
Id like to build a summer home
here but the trees are actually
quite lovely

THE GIANT TREES thick and black-green look ominous as hell
and they shield all but intermittent stripes of sun

A GIANT SPURT OF FLAME leaps up preceded by a slight
popping sound and this particular spurt of flame misses
Westley but Buttercup is suddenly onfire at least the
lower half of her is and --

CUT TO
WESTLEY

instantly forcing Buttercup to sit gathering her flaming
hem in his hands doing his best to suffocate the fire This
isnt all that easy and it causes him a bit of grief but he
does his best to sound as jaunty as before

WESTLEY
Well now that was an adventure

He examines where the flames burst over her

WESTLEY
Singed a bit were you

BUTTERCUP

(She wasnt and she
shakes her head no

He was and he shakes his head no As he pulls her to her
feet --

CUT TO
THE SWAMP FLOOR
-- and as theres another popping sound

CUT TO
WESTLEY GRABBING BUTTERCUP

pulling her aside to safety as another great spun of flame
suddenly shoots up

WESTLEY
Well one thing I will say The
Fire Swamp certainly does keep
you on your toes

Buttercup is frozen with fear He takes her hand gently
leads her forward as we-
CUT TO
THE TWO OF THEM

moving slowly along through a particularly dangerous part of
the Fire Swamp

Its later now the sun slants down at a slightly different
angle

WESTLEY
(happily)
This will all soon be but a happy
memory because Roberts ship
Revenge is anchored at the far
end And I as you know am
Roberts

BUTTERCUP
But how is that possible since
hes been marauding twenty years
and you only left me five years
ago

WESTLEY
I myself am often surprised at
lifes little quirks

There is again a popping sound then a huge spurt of flame
Westley simply picks up Buttercup as they walk along moves
her out of danger puts her back down goes right on talking
without missing a beat

WESTLEY
You see what I told you before
about saying please was true
It intrigued Roberts as did my
descriptions of your beauty

CUT TO
SOME HIDEOUS VINES --

they look like they could be flesh eating Westley takes his
sword slices a path for them to follow The vines groan as
they fall Hes been chatting away the entire time

WESTLEY
Finally Roberts decided something
He said All right Westley
Ive never had a valet You can
try it for tonight Ill most
likely kill you in the morning
Three years he said that Good
night Westley Good work Sleep
well Ill most likely kill you
in the morning It was a fine
time for me I was learning to
fence to fight anything anyone
would teach me And Roberts and I
eventually became friends And
then it happened

BUTTERCUP
What -- go on --

Westley picks her up carrying her across some swamp water
that is bridged by a narrow rickety tree branch

WESTLEY
Well Roberts had grown so rich
he wanted to retire So he took
me to his cabin and told me his
secret I am not the Dread
Pirate Roberts he said My
name is Ryan I inherited this
ship from the previous Dread
Pirate Roberts just as you will
inherit it from me The man I
inherited it from was not the
real Dread Pirate Roberts either

(MORE)

WESTLEY (CONTD)
His name was Cummerbund The real
Roberts has been retired fifteen
years and living like a king in
Patagonia Then he explained the
name was the important thing for
inspiring the necessary fear You
see no one would surrender to
the Dread Pirate Westley

The two of them have by now crossed the pond

WESTLEY
So we sailed ashore took on an
entirely new crew and he stayed
aboard for awhile as first mate
all the time calling me Roberts
Once the crew believed he left
the ship and I have been Roberts
ever since Except now that
were together I shall retire
and hand the name over to someone
else Is everything clear to you

Buttercup perplexed is about to reply but the ground she
steps on gives way -- its Lightning Sand -- a great patch
of it and it has her -- a cloud of powder rises and she
sinks into the stuff crying Westleys name but then she is
gone as we --

CUT TO
WESTLEY WHIRLING

slashing at a U-shaped vine hacks it in half -- its still
connected to the tree Then be grabs it drops his sword
and clutching the other end of the vine he dives into the
lightning sand and there is another cloud of white powder
but it settles quickly

Now nothing can be seen Nothing at all Just the lightning
sand lovely and lethal

HOLD ON THE LIGHTNING SAND -- THEN --

An odd panting sound is heard now The panting sound is
suddenly very loud And then a giant R0US darts into
view The R0US -- a Rodent of Unusual Size -- is probably
no more than eighty pounds of bone and power It sniffs
around a bit then as quickly as it has come it goes

THE LIGHTNING SAND
as Westley lungs long past the bursting point explodes
out he has Buttercup across his shoulders and as he pulls
to the edge of the lightning sand pit using the vine --
CUT TO
CLOSE-UP - BUTTERCUP
Her face is caked with the white powder It is in her eyes
her ears hair mouth Shes still probably beautiful but
you have to look awfully hard to see it As Westley continues
to pull them to safety --
CUT TO
THE R0US
high above them it watches --

CUT TO

BUTTERCUP
placed against a tree Westley is cleaning the lightning
sand from her face He hesitates glances around and

CUT TO
THE R0US
on a much lower branch now It stares down at Westley

Westley stares back up at the beast Buttercup is oblivious
Her eyes flutter He continues to work on her as --

BUTTERCUP
Well never succeed -- we may as
well die here

WESTLEY
No No We have already succeeded

He glances back again Now THERE ARE TWO R0USs The
have climbed into a nearby tree stare hungrily down

CUT TO
WESTLEY picking her up

He puts an arm around her starts to walk with her as he
encouragingly goes on talking

WESTLEY
I mean what are the three
terrors of the Fire Swamp One
the flame spurts No problem
Theres a popping sound preceding
each we can avoid that Two the
Lightning Sand But you were
clever enough to discover what
that looks like so in the future
we can avoid that too

BUTTERCUP
Westley what about the ROUSs

WESTLEY
Rodents of Unusual Size I dont

think they exist

And as he says that a R0US comes flying at him from
offscreen

CUT TO

BUTTERCUP
screaming and --

Westley pinned under the attacking R0US trying to fend
it off Cant The things teeth sink deep into his arm He
howls

Westley drives a fist into the beasts face rolling it off
He reaches for his sword just a few feet away but the
R0US is back atop him Its a fierce battle and just
when we think Westley cant possibly win he flips the ugly
rodent clear

Westley scrambles for his sword The R0US stampedes on
changing its target heading right for --

Buttercup and shes scared to death and --

BUTTERCUP
Westley

Westley abandons his sword reaching for the rodent grabbing
only a tail wrestling with it Buttercup grabs a small
branch and using it as a club beats the skull of the

thing doing pretty well but the beast manages to snag her
hem with its razor teeth and shes pulled to the ground and

WESTLEY

jumping onto its back and the R0US is all over him now
sinking needle teeth into Westleys shoulder

CUT TO
WESTLEY

with death close at hand as a popping sound starts He
tries one desperate move rolls into the sound --

CUT TO
A FLAME SPURT
shooting skyward and --
CUT TO
WESTLEY
with the R0US pinned under him and as the beast bursts

into flame it lets go and Westley rolls safely free grabs
his sword and exhaustedly stabs the R0US which is
trying to put itself out

The R0US collapses dead Westley stands motionless
exhausted The danger has passed

CUT TO
BUTTERCUP
relieved

DISSOLVE TO
THE FAR EDGE OF THE FIRE SWAMP
Beyond a beach

CUT TO

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

BUTTERCUP
(almost in disbelief
We did it
WESTLEY

Now was that so terrible

And from somewhere they summon strength pick up their pace
and as they reach the edge of the Fire Swamp --

CUT TO
SOMETHING WE HADNT EXPECTED
Humperdinck on his horse Rugen beside him THREE WARRIORS
armed and ready are mounted in formation behind Buttercup
and Westley are at the edge of the Fire Swamp about to
leave it They stop Buttercup looks beyond exhaustion

Westley looks worse

HUMPERDINCK
Surrender

Its dusk Behind Humperdinck are the waters of the bay
CUT TO

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

staring out at the others

WESTLEY
You mean you wish to surrender to
me Very well I accept
HUMPERDINCK

I give you full marks for

bravery --dont make yourself a

fool

WESTLEY
Ah but how will you capture us
We know the secrets of the Fire
Swamp We can live there quite
happily for some time So
whenever you feel like dying
feel free to visit

HUMPERDINCK
I tell you once again -- surrender

WESTLEY
It will not happen

CUT TO

BUTTERCUP

looking from one to the other then something else catches
her eye and we --

AN ARMED WARRIOR
in shadow with a loaded crossbow aimed at Westleys heart
CUT TO
BUTTERCUP
looking the other way --
CUT TO
ANOTHER WARRIOR

crossbow aimed at Westley

HUMPERDINCK
(roaring)
For the last time -- SURRENDER
WESTLEY

(roaring right back bigger)
DEATH FIRST
CUT TO
BUTTERCUP
frantically staring around and now

CUT TO
A THIRD WARRIOR

crossbow stretched ready to shoot this one is hidden in a
tree blocking any escape Westley might try

BUTTERCUP
Will you promise not to hurt him

CUT TO
HUMPERDINCK
whirling to face her
HUMPERDINCK
What was that
CUT TO
WESTLEY
whirling to face her
CEE
WESTLEY
What was that
CUT TO
BUTTERCUP

talking to them both

BUTTERCUP

If we surrender and I return
with you will you promise not to
hurt this man

HUMPERDINCK
May I live a thousand years and
never hunt again

BUTTERCUP
(looks at Westley)
He is a sailor on the pirate ship
Revenge Promise to return him
to his ship
HUMPERDINCK
I swear it will be done

CUT TO
BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY
staring deep into each others eyes

CUT TO
HUMPERDINCK AND RUGEN

HUMPERDINCK
(whispering)
Once were out of sight take him
back to Florin and throw him in
the Pit of Despair

RUGEN
(almost a smile)
I swear it will be done

CUT TO
BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

BUTTERCUP
I thought you were dead once and
it almost destroyed me I could
not bear it if you died again
not when I could save you

Westley is dazed Silent

Buttercup tries to speak again cant and is swooped off
her feet onto Humperdincks horse and off they go

CUT TO
WESTLEY

staring after her Rugen watches as his warriors bring
Westley to him The Count has a heavy sword and he holds it
in his hand

RUGEN
Come sir We must get you to
your ship

WESTLEY
We are men of action Lies do not
become us
RUGEN
Well spoken sir --

Westley is looking at him

RUGEN
-- what is it

WESTLEY
You have six fingers on your
right hand -- someone was looking

for you --

Count Rugen clubs Westley hard across the skull Westley
starts to fall --the screen goes black

FADE IN ON
THE PIT OF DESPAIR

Dank and chill underground and windowless lit by flickering
torches Frightening Westley lies in the center of the
cage chained and helpless

CUT TO
SOMETHING REALLY FRIGHTENING A BLOODLESS-LOOKING ALBINO

Dead pale he silently enters the pit carrying a tray of
food and medication He puts it down

WESTLEY
Where am I

ALBINO
(he only whispers)
The Pit of Despair

He begins tending Westleys wounds Westley winces

ALBINO

(garbled)
Dont even think --

(A hack sputter

cough - now his voice

seems normal again)
-- dont even think about trying
to escape The chains are far too
thick And dont dream of being
rescued either The only way in
is secret And only the Prince
the Count and I know how to get
in and out
WESTLEY
Then Im here till I die

ALBINO
(working away)
Till they kill you Yeah

WESTLEY
Then why bother curing me

ALBINO
The Prince and the Count always
insist on everyone being healthy
before theyre broken

WESTLEY
So its to be torture

The albino nods

WESTLEY
I can cope with torture

The albino shakes his head

WESTLEY
You dont believe me

ALBINO
You survived the Fire Swamp You
must be very brave
(little pause)
but nobody withstands The
Machine

He studies Westley whose face is almost sad

CUT TO
BUTTERCUP
and her face is sad Pallid perhaps ill She wanders down a
corridor in Florin Castle As she moves unseeing past an
intersecting corridor

CUT TO
PRINCE HUMPERDINCK AND COUNT RUGEN

watching her

HUMPERDINCK
Shes been like that ever since
the Fire Swamp

(looks at Rugen)
Its my fathers failing health
thats upsetting her

RUGEN
(unbelieving)
Of course

As they move on--
CUT TO

FLORIN CASTLE - NIGHT

CAMERA HOLDS ON IT while we hear the Grandfathers voice
reading

GRANDFATHER
(off-screen)
The King died that very night
and before the following dawn
Buttercup and Humperdinck were
married

CUT TO

MAIN SQUARE OF FLORIN CASTLE

And if we thought it was packed before we didnt know how
many more could fit in this courtyard Humperdinck Rugen
and the Queen stand high on the balcony

GRANDFATHER
(off-screen)
And at noon she met her subjects
again This time as their Queen

HUMPERDINCK
My fathers final words were

THE KID
(off-screen)
-- hold it Hold it Grandpa
And the scene FREEZES Humperdinck caught in mid-sentence
CUT TO

THE KIDS ROOM

The Kid is half sitting now not strong yet but clearly
stronger than when we first saw him
THE KID
You read that wrong She doesnt
marry Humperdinck she marries
Westley Im just sure of it
After all that Westley did for
her if she does not marry him
it wouldnt be fair

GRANDFATHER
Well who says life is fair
Where is that written Life isnt
always fair

THE KID
Im telling you youre messing up
the story now get it right

GRANDFATHER
Do you want me to go on with this

THE KID
Yes

GRANDFATHER
All right then No more
interruptions

(starts to read again)
at noon she met her subjects
again This time as their Queen

And on these words--

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK
HUMPERDINCK

My fathers final words were

love her as I loved her and

there will be joy I present to

you your Queen Queen Buttercup
And on his words--

CUT TO

THE CROWD
and its gigantic

CUT TO

THE ARCHWAY
we saw before as Buttercup emerges
CUT TO
THE CROWD

suddenly going to its knees wave after wave of silent
KNEELING PEOPLE All of them down

CUT TO
BUTTERCUP
touched as before but then she seems stunned as we
CUT TO
THE CROWD

SOMEONE IS BOOING The BOOING gets louder as an ANCIENT
WOMAN approaches Buttercup through the crowd BOOING every
step of the way

BUTTERCUP
Why do you do this

ANCIENT BOOER
Because you had love in your
hands and you gave it up

BUTTERCUP
(distraught)
But they would have killed
Westley if I hadnt done it

ANCIENT BOOER

Your true love lives and you
marry another --

(to the crowd)
-- True love saved her in the
Fire Swamp and she treated it
like garbage And thats what she
is the Queen of Refuse So bow
down to her if you want Bow to
her Bow to the Queen of Slime
the Queen of Filth the Queen of
Putrescence Boo Boo Rubbish
Filth Slime Muck Boo Boo

She advances on Buttercup now who is more and more panicked
CLOSE-UP - THE ANCIENT BOOER

Louder and louder and LOUDER she shrieks vituperation at
Buttercup reaching out her old hands toward Buttercups
throat and Buttercup is as frightened now as Dorothy was
when the Witch went after her in The Wizard of Oz and
suddenly

CUT TO
BUTTERCUP

coming out of her nightmare alone in her castle bedroom As
she frantically grabs a robe and starts to run

GRANDFATHER
(off-screen still reading)
It was ten days till the wedding
The King still lived but
Buttercups nightmares were
growing steadily worse

THE KID
(off-screen)
See Didnt I tell you shed
never marry that rotten
Humperdinck

GRANDFATHER
(off-screen)
-- yes youre very smart Shut-Up

CUT TO
BUTTERCUP

bursting into the Princes chambers Count Rugen stands
nearby

BUTTERCUP
It comes to this I love Westley
I always have I know now I
always will If you tell me I
must marry you in ten days
please believe I will be dead by
morning

CUT TO
PRINCE HUMPERDINCK
Just stunned Finally softly he begins to talk

HUMPERDINCK
I could never cause you grief
consider our wedding off
(to Rugen)
You returned this Westley to his
ship

RUGEN
Yes

HUMPERDINCK

Then we will simply alert him

(to Buttercup now)
Beloved are you certain he still
wants you After all it was you
who did the leaving in the Fire
Swamp Not to mention that
pirates are not known to be men
of their words

BUTTERCUP
My Westley will always come for me

HUMPERDINCK
I suggest a deal You write four
copies of a letter Ill send my
four fastest ships One in each
direction The Dread Pirate
Roberts is always close to Florin
this time of year Well run up
the white flag and deliver your
message If Westley wants you
bless you both If not please
consider me as an alternative to
suicide Are we agreed

And she nods --

A VERY THICK GROVE OF TREES

The trees are unusual in one respect all of them are
extraordinarily heavily knotted

PULL BACK TO REVEAL
Humperdinck and Rugen walking into the grove of trees

RUGEN
Your Princess is really a winning
creature A trifle simple
perhaps but her appeal is
undeniable

HUMPERDINCK
Oh I know The people are quite
taken with her Its odd but

when I hired Vizzini to have her
murdered on our engagement day I
thought that was clever But its
going to be so much more moving
when I strangle her on our
wedding night Once Guilder is
blamed the nation will be truly
outraged Theyll demand we go to
war

They are deeper into the grove now Rugen is searching around

RUGEN

Now where is that secret knot
Its impossible to find

(Finding the knot on

the tree he hits it

and it opens revealing

a staircase leading underground)
Are you coming down into the Pit
Westleys got his strength back
I am starting him on The Machine
tonight

HUMPERDINCK
Tyrone you know how much I love
watching you work But Ive got
my countrys five hundredth
anniversary to plan my wedding
to arrange My wife to murder
and Guilder to frame for it Im

swamped

RUGEN
Get some rest -- if you havent
got your health you havent got
anything

Rugen smiles and hurries down the stairs as the tree slides
back perfectly into place

CUT TO
AN ENORMOUS THING

We cant tell quite what it is or what it does but somehow
it is unsettling

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Count Rugen dragging Westley up alongside the thing --
Levers and wheels and wires you name it its there

RUGEN
Beautiful isnt it
The Albino starts attaching suction cups to Westley

RUGEN
It took me half a lifetime to
invent it Im sure youve
discovered my deep and abiding
interest in pain At present Im
writing the definitive work on
the subject So I want you to be
totally honest with me on how The
Machine makes you feel

CUT TO
A DIAL

with numbers ranging from a low of 1 to a high of 50
Rugen goes to it

RUGEN
This being our first try Ill
use the lowest setting

And he turns the dial to 1

WESTLEY

He has suction cups on his head now on his temple on his
heart his hands and feet He says nothing keeps control of
himself

CUT TO
COUNT RUGEN

fiddling with his Machine a moment more And then he opens
the flood gate water pours down the chute turning the
wheel which in turn really gets The Machine going

CUT TO
WESTLEY

and hes lying on the table and hes only flesh and the
chains are metal and thick but such is his desperation it
almost seems he might break them A terrible sound comes
from his throat an incessant gasping It keeps on coming as
we finally

CUT TO
COUNT RUGEN

He switches off The Machine picks up a large notebook and
pen sits in a chair The NOISE of The Machine subsides
Rugen opens the book to a blank page

RUGEN
As you know the concept of the
suction pump is centuries old
Well really thats all this is
Except that instead of sucking
water Im sucking life Ive
just sucked one year of your life
away I might one day go as high
as five but I really dont know
what that would do to you So
lets just start with what we
have What did this do to you
Tell me And remember this is
for posterity so be honest --
how do you feel

AND NOW AT LAST

WESTLEY
in anguish so deep it is dizzying Helpless he cries
Count Rugen watches the tears then starts to write

RUGEN
Interesting

CUT TO

HUMPERDINCK

in his quarters swamped Piles of papers are strewn all
over Now YELLIN a pale shifty quick-eyed man appears in
the doorway

HUMPERDINCK
Yellin

YELLIN
(bows then kneels)
Sire

HUMPERDINCK
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin
I trust you with this secret
killers from Guilder are
infiltrating the Thieves Forest
and plan to murder my bride on
our wedding night

YELLIN
My spy network has heard no such
news
CUT TO
BUTTERCUP
entering
BUTTERCUP
Any word from Westley
CUT TO

THE PRINCE AND YELLIN
turning to her in the doorway

HUMPERDINCK
Too soon my angel Patience

BUTTERCUP
He will come for me

HUMPERDINCK
Of course

As she glides out--

HUMPERDINCK
She will not be murdered On the
day of the wedding I want the
Thieves Forest emptied and every
inhabitant arrested

YELLIN
Many of the thieves will resist
My regular enforcers will be
inadequate

HUMPERDINCK
Form a Brute Squad then I want
the Thieves Forest emptied
before I wed

YELLIN
It wont be easy Sire
HUMPERDINCK
(alone exhausted)
Try ruling the world sometime

CUT TO
THE THIEVES FOREST - DAY

A lot of hollering is going on The THIEVES are being
rounded up by the BRUTE SQUAD a large group of large men
Yellin stands on a wagon in the midst of all the scuffling

GRANDFATHER
(off-screen)
The day of the wedding arrived
The Brute Squad had their hands
full carrying out Humperdincks
orders

YELLIN
(to an unpleasantlooking
assistant)
Is everybody out

ASSISTANT BRUTE
Almost Theres a Spaniard giving
us some trouble

YELLIN
Well you give him some trouble
Move

And his wagon starts and as it does
CUT TO
INIGO

drunk as a skunk sprawled in front of a hovel a bottle of
brandy in one hand the six-fingered sword in the other He
looks dreadful Unshaven puffy-eyed gaunt But the way he
brandishes the great sword in front of him would give anyone
cause for worry

INIGO
I am waiting for you Vizzini
You told me to go back to the
beginning So I have This is
where I am and this is where
Ill stay I will not be moved

He takes a long pull from his brandy bottle He stops as the
Assistant Brute comes into view
ASSISTANT BRUTE

Ho there

INIGO
I do not budge Keep your Ho
there

He waves his sword dangerously

ASSISTANT BRUTE
But the Prince gave orders --

INIGO
-- So did Vizzini -- when a job
went wrong you went back to the
beginning And this is where we
got the job So its the
beginning and Im staying till
Vizzini comes

ASSISTANT BRUTE
(gesturing off-screen)
You Brute Come here

INIGO
-- I -- am -- waiting -- for --
Vizzini --

VOICE

(off-screen)
You surely are a meanie

INIGO feels a hand on his back A huge hand He compares it
to his own smaller hand

FEZZIK
Hello

INIGO
Its you

FEZZIK
True

And as the Assistant Brute is just about to club Inigos
brains out FEZZIK lets fly with a stupendous punch

The Assistant Brute takes the full force of the blow right
in the chops Its like he was shot from a cannon as he
careens backwards out of sight across the street

There is a pause Then a crunching sound as he clearly has
come in contact with something hard and immobile
FEZZIK puts Inigo down

FEZZIK
You dont look so good
(after Inigo blasts
air in protest)
You dont smell so good either

INIGO
Perhaps not I feel fine

FEZZIK
Yeah

And so FEZZIK puts Inigo down Thats when Inigo faints and
as he does

CUT TO
AN EMPTY ALEHOUSE IN THE THIEVES QUARTER

Inigo sits slumped in a chair while FEZZIK spoons him some
stew

GRANDFATHER
(off-screen)

FEZZIK and Inigo were reunited
And as FEZZIK nursed his
inebriated friend back to health
he told Inigo of Vizzinis death
and the existence of Count Rugen
the sixfingered man Considering
Inigos lifelong search he
handled the news surprisingly well

And he faints again into his stew
CUT TO

TWO LARGE TUBS

one filled with steaming water the other with water clearly
of an icy nature Without a word FEZZIK stuffs Inigos head
into the icy water then after a reasonable amount of time
pulls him out ducks him into the steaming stuff and a
short time after that puts him back in the cold again then
back in the hot --

GRANDFATHER
(off-screen)
Fezzik took great care in reviving
Inigo

INIGO
(up and going)
Thats enough Thats enough
Where is this Rugen so I may kill
him

FEZZIK
Hes with the Prince in the
Castle But the castle gate is
guarded by thirty men

INIGO
How many could you handle

FEZZIK
I dont think more than ten

INIGO

(doing the math on his fingers)
That leaves twenty for me At my
best I could never defeat that
many

(he sinks sadly down)
I need Vizzini to plan I have no
gift for strategy

FEZZIK
But Vizzinis dead

CUT TO
THE TWO OF THEM
Silent and bereft Then a wild look hits Inigo

INIGO
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the
Man in Black --

FEZZIK
-- what --

INIGO
-- look he bested you with
strength your greatness He
bested me with steel He must
have outthought Vizzini anda
man who can do that can plan my
castles onslaught any day Lets
go --

FEZZIK
-- where

INIGO
To find the Man in Black
obviously

FEZZIK
But you dont know where he is

INIGO
(he is possessed by
demons now)
Dont bother me with trifles
after twenty years at last my
fathers soul will be at peace

CUT TO
CLOSE UP - INIGO
INIGO

(big)
There will be blood tonight

PRINCE HUMPERDINCKS CHAMBERS
-- strewn with maps etc Yellin enters and kneels

HUMPERDINCK
(sharpening his dagger)
Rise and report

YELLIN
The Thieves Forest is emptied
Thirty men guard the castle gate

HUMPERDINCK
Double it My Princess must be
safe

YELLIN
The gate has but one key and I
carry that

He shows the key dangling from a chain around his neck
Just at that moment Buttercup enters

HUMPERDINCK
Ah My dulcet darling Tonight we
marry Tomorrow morning your men
will escort us to Florin Channel
where every ship in my armada
waits to accompany us on our
honeymoon
BUTTERCUP
Every ship but your four fastest
you mean

The Prince looks at her blankly for a moment

BUTTERCUP
Every ship but the four you sent

HUMPERDINCK
Yes Yes of course Naturally
not those four

YELLIN
(bows exits)
Your Majesties

CUT TO
BUTTERCUP

staring at Humperdinck

BUTTERCUP
You never sent the ships Dont
bother lying It doesnt matter
Westley will come for me anyway

HUMPERDINCK
(sharply)
Youre a silly girl

BUTTERCUP
Yes I ama silly girl for not
having seen sooner that you were
nothing but a coward with a heart
full of fear

HUMPERDINCK
(close to erupting
speaks very distinctly)
I-would-not-say-such things-if-
Iwere-you-

BUTTERCUP
Why not You cant hurt me
Westley and I are joined by the
bonds of love And you cannot
track that Not with a thousand
bloodhounds And you cannot break
it Not with a thousand swords
And when I say you are a coward
that is only because you are the
slimiest weakling ever to crawl
the earth
CUT TO
HUMPERDINCK

jumping at her yanking her by the hair starting to pull
her along out of control his words indistinct

HUMPERDINCK
IWOULDNOTSAYSUCHTHINGSIFIWEREYOU

CUT TO

A CORRIDOR OF THE CASTLE

as the Prince throws open the door to Buttercups room
slams it shut locks it breaks into a wild run and --

WESTLEY IN THE MACHINE

but its not on Count Rugen is adding more notes to his
book He looks up as the Prince suddenly comes down the
steps raging

HUMPERDINCK
(at Westley)

You truly love each other and so
you might have been truly happy
Not one couple in a century has
that chance no matter what the
storybooks say And so I think no
man in a century will suffer as
greatly as you will

And with that he whirls turns on The Machine grabs the
lever and --

CUT TO
COUNT RUGEN
calling out --
RUGEN
Not to fifty
But its too late as we --
CUT TO

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK
shoving the lever all the way up and
CUT TO
WESTLEYS FACE

And there has never been such pain The pain grows and grows
and with it now something else has started

THE DEATH SCREAM As The Death Scream starts to rise --
CUT TO
OUTSIDE THE PIT OF DESPAIR

as the SOUND moves along LOUDER AND LOUDER and --

CUT TO

YELLIN AND HIS SIXTY BRUTES

and they bear it and a few of the Brutes turn to each other
in fear and as the scream builds --

CUT TO
BUTTERCUP IN HER ROOM
and she hears the SOUND doesnt know what it is but her
arms involuntarily go around her body to try to control the
trembling and the scream still builds and --

CUT TO
ESTABLISHING SHOT ACROSS THE RIVER
There are many PEOPLE --it is the day of the countrys 500th
Anniversary -- but all the People stop as the sound hits
them A few CHILDREN pale bolt toward their PARENTS and --

CUT TO

INIGO AND FEZZIK

trying to make their way through the jammed marketplace
which suddenly quiets as the fading sound comes through

INIGO
(instantly)
FEZZIK FEZZIK listen do you hear -- That is the sound of

ultimate suffering My heart made that sound when Rugen
slaughtered my father The Man in Black makes it now

FEZZIK
The Man in Black

INIGO
His true love is marrying another
tonight so who else has cause
for Ultimate Suffering
(trying to push through)
Excuse me --

Its too crowded

INIGO
-- pardon me its important --

No one budges and the sound is fading faster

INIGO
-- Fezzik please --

FEZZIK
(gigantic and roaring)
Everybody MOVE

And the Crowd begins to fall away and he and Inigo start to
track the FADING SOUND

INIGO
Thank you

CUT TO
A GROVE OF TREES NEAR THE PIT OF DESPAIR

The Albino appears wheeling a barrow Inigos sword pushes
at his chest

INIGO
Where is the Man in Black

The Albino shakes his head says nothing

INIGO
You get there from this grove yes

Silence

INIGO
Fezzik jog his memory

And Fezzik crunches the Albino on the top of the head as if
he had a hammer and was driving in a nail The Albino drops
without a sound
FEZZIK
(upset)
Im sorry Inigo I didnt mean
to jog him so hard Inigo
CUT TO
INIGO

He kneels the sword held tight between his hands Eyes
closed he faces the grove of trees starts to talk his
voice low and strange

INIGO

Father I have failed you for
twenty years Now our misery can
end Somewhere somewhere
close by is a man who can help us
I cannot find him alone I need
you I need you to guide my sword
Please

And now he rises eyes still closed

INIGO
Guide my sword

CUT TO
THE GROVE OF TREES

as Inigo eyes shut tight walks forward the great sword
held in his hands

Fezzik frightened follows close behind

CUT TO
THE SECRET KNOT
that reveals the staircase

CUT TO
INIGO

walking blind through the grove of trees He moves to the
Secret Knot hesitates then moves past it

Then Inigo stops For a long moment he stands frozen
Suddenly he whirls eyes still closed and the sword strikes
home dead center into a knot and --
Nothing He has failed
In utter despair he collapses against the tree Against a
knot in the tree Against THE KNOT in the tree It slides

away revealing the staircase FEZZIK and Inigo look at each
other then start down

CUT TO

WESTLEY

heartbeat Then he looks at Inigo shakes his head

FEZZIK

INIGO
(barely able to speak)
It just is not fair

THE KIDS ROOM

He is terribly excited and looks stronger than weve yet

to stiffen up a little He lays Westley down across a bench

MIRACLE MAX

starts to pump

MIRACLE MAX

And he presses lightly on Westleys chest

WESTLEY

Everybody stares at Westley lying there on the bench

INIGO
True love You heard him You

cause than that

MIRACLE MAX

Sonny true love is the greatest

toward

MIRACLE MAX

INIGO
Humiliations galore

MIRACLE MAX
That is a noble cause Give me

And as Valerie shrieks excitedly we

CUT TO
THIS LUMP
It is somewhat smaller than a tennis ball

PULL BACK TO REVEAL MAX AND VALERIE exhausted looking at
the lump with beautific pleasure as Valerie cooking
utensil in hand covers the thing with what looks like
chocolate Inigo and FEZZIK stare at the thing too but more
dubiously

INIGO
(a little appalled)
Thats a miracle pill

Max nods

VALERIE
(finishing)
The chocolate coating makes it go
down easier But you have to wait
fifteen minutes for full potency
And you shouldnt go swimming
after for at least what

MIRACLE MAX
An hour

VALERIE
Yeah an hour

MIRACLE MAX
A good hour Yeah
Inigo accepts the pill as FEZZIK takes Westley who is stiff
as a board now

INIGO
(heading out the door
Fezzik close behind)
Thank you for everything

MIRACLE MAX

VALERIE
(waving after them)
Bye-bye boys

MIRACLE MAX
Have fun storming the castle

VALERIE
(to Max)
Think itll work

MIRACLE MAX
It would take a miracle Bye

VALERIE

And as they wave trying to look happy we --
CUT TO
FEZZIK INIGO AND WESTLEY

on the top of the outer wall of the castle They look down
to the front gate of the castle The sixty Brutes are visible

FEZZIK is thunderstruck by how many Brutes there are Upset
he turns to Inigo who is concentrating unsuccessfully
trying to prop Westley against the wall

FEZZIK
Inigo -- theres more than
thirty --

INIGO

(absolutely unfazed)
Whats the difference
(indicating the half-
dead Westley)
Weve got him Help me here
Well have to force feed him
FEZZIK
Has it been fifteen minutes

INIGO
We cant wait -- the weddings in
half an hour and we must strike
in the hustle and the bustle
beforehand

During this FEZZIK using all his strength has managed to
get Westley into a right angled sitting position while
Inigo brings out the miracle pill

INIGO
Tilt his head back Open his mouth

FEZZIK
(following orders)
How long do we have to wait
before we know if the miracle
works

CUT TO
INIGO
Pill in hand he drops it into Westleys mouth

INIGO
Your guess is as good as mine --

WESTLEY
(frantic)
Ill beat you both apart Ill
take you both together

FEZZIK
Guess not very long

Inigo and FEZZIK react Westley is the only one not amazed

WESTLEY
Why wont my arms move

He sits there immobile like a ventriloquists dummy

FEZZIK
Youve been mostly dead all day

INIGO
We had Miracle Max make a pill to
bring you back

WESTLEY
Who are you -- Are we enemies
Why am I on this wall -- Wheres
Buttercup --

INIGO
Let me explain --
(pauses very briefly)
-- No there is too much Let me
sum up

INIGO (CONTD)
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck
in a little less than half an
hour so all we have to do is get
in break up the wedding steal
the Princess make our escape
after I kill Count Rugen

WESTLEY
That doesnt leave much time for
dilly dallying

He is watching his fingers one of which twitches now

FEZZIK
Youve just wiggled your finger
Thats wonderful

WESTLEY
Ive always been a quick healer
(to Inigo)
What are our liabilities

INIGO
There is but one working castle

Fezzik helps Inigo raise Westley just high enough so he can
see for himself

INIGO
And it is guarded by sixty men

WESTLEY
And our assets

INIGO
Your brains Fezziks strength

CUT TO

WESTLEY
absolutely stunned

WESTLEY
Thats it Impossible If I hada
month to plan maybe I could come
up with something But this

He shakes his head from side to side

CUT TO

INIGO AND FEZZIK

FEZZIK
(trying to be cheery)
You just shook your head -- that

doesnt make you happy

WESTLEY
My brains his steel and your
strength against sixty men and
you think a little head jiggle is
supposed to make me happy I
mean if we only had a
wheelbarrow that would be
something

INIGO
Where did we put that wheelbarrow
the Albino had

FEZZIK
Over the Albino I think

WESTLEY
Well why didnt you list that
among our assets in the first
place What I wouldnt give for a
holocaust cloak

INIGO
There we cannot help you

FEZZIK
(pulling one out)
Will this do

INIGO
(to Fezzik-- surprised)
Where did you get that

FEZZIK
At Miracle Maxs It fit so nice
he said I could keep it

WESTLEY
All right all right Come on
help me up
Inigo and Fezzik do
WESTLEY

Now Ill need a sword eventually

INIGO
Why You cant even lift one

WESTLEY

True but thats hardly common
knowledge is it

(And his bead tilts

limply back Fezzik

sets it up right for him)
Thank you Now there may be
problems once were inside

INIGO
Ill say -- how do I find the
Count -- Once I do how do I
find you again -- Once I find

you again how do we escape --

FEZZIK
(sharply)
Dont pester him hes had a hard
day
INIGO

(nods)
Right right sorry

CUT TO
A SHOT OF THE THREE OF THEM IN PROFILE

They move along the wall in silence for a time Then these
words come to us on the wind --

FEZZIK
Inigo

INIGO

FEZZIK

CUT TO
BUTTERCUP

CUT TO
BUTTERCUP

BUTTERCUP
My Westley will save me

CUT TO
HER WESTLEY
looking down on the gate with Inigo and Fezzik
CUT TO
THE MAIN GATE OF THE CASTLE
-- and Yellin standing there flanked by his sixty Brutes
CUT TO
WESTLEY AND INIGO AND FEZZIK

looking out at the enemy This is it Inigo and FEZZIK shake
hands

Westley cant even do that but after a bit of rocking back
and forth he manages to get enough momentum to catapult his
arm over and onto his friends

CUT TO
AN ABSOLUTELY GEM-LIKE LITTLE CHAPEL

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The most intelligent looking the most impressive appearing
CLERGYMAN imaginable

Buttercup and Humperdinck kneel before the Clergyman Behind
them sit the mumbling old KING AND QUEEN Standing in the
back is Count Rugen

FOUR GUARDS are in position flanking the chapel door

IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
(clears his throat
begins to speak)
Mawidgemawidge is what bwings

He has an impediment that would stop a clock

IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
Mawidge the bwessed awwangement

And now from outside the castle there begins to come a
commotion And then--

YELLIN
(off-screen)
Stand your ground men Stand
your ground
CUT TO
THE BRUTES AND YELLIN

by the gate for it is indeed they who are making the
commotion frightened pointing

YELLIN
Stand your ground

CUT TO
THEIR POV

And it is a bit unnerving -- a GIANT seems to be floating
toward them out of the darkness a Giant in a strange cloak
and with a voice that would crumble walls

FEZZIK
(deep and booming)
I AM THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS
THERE WILL BE NO SURVIVORS

FEZZIK

and he seems to be floating because hes standing in the
wheelbarrow as Inigo hidden behind him busts a gut by
pushing it and supporting Westley

INIGO
Now
WESTLEY
Not yet
CUT TO
THE GIANT FLOATING CLOSER
FEZZIK
MY MEN ARE HERE AND I AM HERE
BUT SOON YOU WILL NOT BE HERE

orders instructions and as yet the Brutes hold Now --

CUT TO
INIGO AND WESTLEY
Inigo struggles bravely under their combined weight --

INIGO

FEZZIK

CUT TO

THE CHAPEL where The Impressive Clergyman plows on

IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK turning quickly giving a sharp nod to
Count Rugen who immediately takes off out of the chapel
with the Four Guards as we

CUT TO

FEZZIK flaming and scary as hell

FEZZIK
THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS IS HERE
FOR YOUR SOULS

CUT TO
YELLIN

as suddenly the Brutes just scream and take off in wild
panic --

YELLIN

CUT TO
INSIDE THE CHAPEL

IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN

HUMPERDINCK

IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN

As Humperdinck whips out the ring the screams are very loud
outside
BUTTERCUP
Here comes my Westley now

CUT TO
Fezzik as he pulls off the holocaust cloak

WESTLEY
FEZZIK the portcullis

And FEZZIK rushes forward grabbing the portcullis which is
indeed closing quickly

FEZZIK grabs the gate and swings the tonnage back upward
Yellin just watches in fear

CUT TO
THE CHAPEL
as Humperdinck shoves the ring on Buttercups finger

HUMPERDINCK
Your Westley is dead

Buttercup only smiles shakes her head

HUMPERDINCK
I killed him myself

BUTTERCUP
(never more serene)
Then why is there fear behind

HUMPERDINCK
(whirling to the King
and Queen)
Escort the bride to the Honeymoon
Suite -- Ill be there shortly
And as he dashes off --
CUT TO
BUTTERCUP

standing there Dazed

BUTTERCUP
He didnt come

CUT TO
COUNT RUGEN AND HIS FOUR WARRIORS
racing through the castle and as they reach a complex

intersection of several corridors Rugen stops incredulous
as we
CUT TO
WESTLEY INIGO AND FEZZIK

moving toward them Actually Fezzik is dragging Westley who
is in turn dragging Yellins sword like a stiff dog
leash --Westley simply hasnt the strength to raise it

COUNT RUGEN

as the confrontation is about to start

RUGEN
Kill the dark one and the giant
but leave the third for
questioning

And as his Warriors attack --

Inigo goes wild and maybe the Warriors are good maybe
theyre even better than that -- but they never get a chance
to show it because this is something now this is Inigo gone
mad and the six-fingered sword has never flashed faster and
the FOURTH WARRIOR is dead before the FIRST ONE has even hit
the floor There is a pause Then --

INIGO
(to Rugen evenly and soft)
Hello My name is Inigo Montoya
You killed my father Prepare to
die

CUT TO

COUNT RUGEN

For a moment he just stands there sword in hand Then he
does a most unexpected thing He turns and runs the hell away

CUT TO

INIGO

momentarily surprised then taking off after him leaving
Westley and Fezzik to exchange curious looks and Rugen
running through a half-open heavy wooden door shutting it
and locking it just as Inigo throws himself against it He
tries again No kind of chance

INIGO
(calling out)
Fezzik I need you --
CUT TO
FEZZIK WITH WESTLEY

who is still unable to walk under his own power He calls
back --

FEZZIK
(indicating Westley)
I cant leave him alone
CUT TO
INIGO

desperately pounding at the heavy door
INIGO
Hes getting away from me Fezzik
Please FEZZIK
CUT TO
FEZZIK AND WESTLEY
FEZZIK
(to Westley)
Ill be right back
And he props Westley up against a large suit of armor and
takes off toward the intersection where Inigos voice came
from --
CUT TO
INIGO
still hammering the door Fezzik approaches gestures for
him to stop and with one mighty swipe of his mighty hands

the door crumbles

INIGO
Thank you --

And Inigo flies through as Fezzik heads back to Westley
CUT TO
BUTTERCUP WALKING WITH THE KING AND QUEEN

The Queen more sprightly is several paces ahead
KING
(can hardly be understood)
Strange wedding

QUEEN
Yes A very strange wedding Come
along

Buttercup gently stops the King and places a kiss on his
forehead Hes very surprised and pleased

KING
What was that for

BUTTERCUP
Because youve always been so
kind to me And I wont be seeing
you again since Im killing
myself once we reach the Honeymoon
Suite

KING
(smiling away --his
hearing isnt what it
once was)
Wont that be nice
(calling out to the Queen)
She kissed me
And on those words --

CUT TO

COUNT RUGEN

And hes running dashing through corridors and as he
glances back --

CUT TO
INIGO
behind him coming like a streak and --
CUT TO
THE INTERSECTION
with the large suit of armor and Fezzik gaping staring at
all those choices trying to piece together the puzzle of

the missing Westley

CUT TO
COUNT RUGEN

flashing out of one room down a staircase picking up his
pace He pulls out a deadly looking dagger with a sharp
point and a triangular shaped blade and sprints on and --

CUT TO

INIGO

closing the gap closer closer and hes down the stairs and
heading into a dining hall and --

CUT TO
COUNT RUGEN
throwing the dagger --

CUT TO
INIGO

trying like hell to get out of the way but no and it
sticks deep into his stomach and he hurtles back helplessly
against the wall of the room his eyes glazed blood coming
from his wound

The room is going white on him

INIGO
Sorry Father I tried
I tried

CUT TO
COUNT RUGEN

looking across the room at Inigo He stares at Inigos face
and then touches his own cheeks as memory comes

RUGEN

You must be that little Spanish
brat I taught a lesson to all
those years ago Its simply
incredible Have you been chasing
me your whole life only to fail
now I think thats the worst
thing I ever heard How marvelous

Inigo sinks

CUT TO
BUTTERCUP

shutting the door of the Honeymoon Suite crossing quietly
to the far wall where she sits at a table opens a jeweled
box and takes out a very deadly looking dagger She seems
very much at peace as she touches the knife to her bosom

WESTLEY
Theres a shortage of perfect
breasts in this world It would
be a pity to damage yours

And Buttercup whirls as we --
CUT TO
WESTLEY

lying on the bed Yellins sword is beside him His voice
sounds just fine but he does not move

Buttercup leaps to the bed covering him with kisses
Westley is helpless

BUTTERCUP
Oh Westley darling
(more kisses)
Westley why wont you hold me

WESTLEY
(gently)
Gently

BUTTERCUP
At a time like this thats all
you can think to say Gently

WESTLEY
(not so gently)
Gently
And she lets go thumping his head against the headboard and
CUT TO
COUNT RUGEN

looking very much surprised

RUGEN
Good heavens Are you still
trying to win

PULL BACK TO REVEAL
Inigo struggling feebly pulling the dagger from his
stomach Holding the wound with his left hand

Rugen is pushing off from the table sword in hand moving
in to kill Inigo

RUGEN
Youve got an overdeveloped sense
of vengeance Its going to get
you into trouble some day

Inigo watches the Count approach and the Count flicks his
sword at Inigos heart and theres not much Inigo can do
just kind of vaguely parry the thrust with the six-fingered
sword and Count Rugens blade sinks deeply into Inigos left
shoulder

Inigo doesnt seem to feel it his other agonies are so much
worse

CUT TO
THE COUNT
stepping back going for the heart again

CUT TO
INIGO
And as this blow comes hes trying to use the wall for
support in forcing himself to his feet and its not a
roaring success of an attempt but he does at least make
some progress and again he manages to parry the thrust as
this time Rugens sword runs through his right arm Again
Inigo doesnt seem to mind doesnt even feel it

CUT TO
COUNT RUGEN
stepping back forj ust a moment watching as Inigo continues
to inch his way to his feet and then just before the Count
is about to strike again Inigo manages a little flick of
his own and Rugen hadnt expected it and he jumps back
makes a little involuntary cry of surprise and

CUT TO
INIGO

slowly pushing away from the wall
INIGO
(all but audible)
Hello My name is Inigo Montoya
you killed my father prepare to
die

CUT TO

COUNT RUGEN

suddenly going into a fierce attack striking with great
power and precision for he is a master swordsman and he
forces Inigo easily back drives him easily into the wall
But he does not penetrate Inigos defense None of the
Counts blows get home As the Count steps back a moment --

CUT TO
INIGO
pushing slowly off from the wall again

INIGO
(a little louder)
Hello My name is Inigo Montoya
you killed my father prepare to
die

CUT TO
THE COUNT

And again he attacks slashing with wondrous skill But none
of his blows get through and slowly Inigo again moves
forward

INIGO
(a little louder still)
Hello My name is Inigo Montoya
You killed my father Prepare to
die

RUGEN
Stop saying that

CUT TO
COUNT RUGEN
retreating more quickly around the table
Inigo drives for the Counts left shoulder now thrusts home

where the Count had gotten him Then another move and his
blade enters the Counts right shoulder the same spot Inigo
was wounded

INIGO
(all hes got)
HELLO MY NAME IS INIGO MONTOYA
YOU KILLED MY FATHER PREPARE TO
DIE

RUGEN
INIGO
-- offer me money --

And now the six-fingered sword strikes and there is a slash
bleeding along one of Rugens cheeks

RUGEN
-- yes --
INIGO
-- power too -- promise me that --

The great sword flashes again and now there is a parallel
slash bleeding on Rugens other cheek

RUGEN
-- all that I have and more
please --

INIGO
-- offer me everything I ask

for --

RUGEN
-- anything you want --

INIGO
(roaring)
I WANT MY FATHER BACK YOU SON-
OFA-BITCH
And on that --
CUT TO

INIGO

and almost too fast for the eye to follow the sword strikes
one final time and --

CUT TO

COUNT RUGEN
crying out in fear and panic as the sword hits home dead
center and --

CUT TO

INIGO AND RUGEN

the sword clear through the Count They are almost frozen
like that for a moment Then Inigo withdraws his sword and
as the Count pitches down --

CUT TO
RUGEN

lying dead His skin is ashen and the blood still pours from
the parallel cuts on his cheeks and his eyes are bulging
wide full of fear

CUT TO

INIGO

staring at Rugen And now Inigo does something we have never
seen him do before he smiles HOLD FOR JUST A MOMENT on
Inigo smiling then --

CUT TO
INSIDE THE HONEYMOON SUITE

WESTLEY lies as before not a muscle has moved his head is
still on the headboard Yellins sword at his side

Buttercup is alongside the bed her eyes never leave his face

BUTTERCUP
Oh Westley will you ever
forgive me

WESTLEY
What hideous sin have you
committed lately

BUTTERCUP
I got married I didnt want to
It all happened so fast

WESTLEY
It never happened

BUTTERCUP
What
WESTLEY
It never happened

BUTTERCUP
But it did I was there This old
man said Man and wife

WESTLEY
Did you say I do

BUTTERCUP
Well no we sort of skipped that
part

WESTLEY
Then youre not married -- if you
didnt say it you didnt do it
(a pause)
-- wouldnt you agree Your
Highness

CUT TO
HUMPERDINCK
entering the room staring at them He pulls out his sword

HUMPERDINCK
A technicality that will shortly
be remedied But first things
first To the death

WESTLEY
No
(a little pause)
To the pain

HUMPERDINCK
(about to charge
stops short)
I dont think Im quite familiar
with that phrase

WESTLEY
Ill explain And Ill use small
words so that youll be sure to
understand you wart-hog-faced
buffoon

HUMPERDINCK
That may be the first time in my
life a man has dared insult me
CUT TO

WESTLEY
lying there comfortably his words quiet at first

WESTLEY
It wont be the last To the pain
means the first thing you lose
will be your feet below the
ankles then your hands at the
wrists next your nose

CUT TO
HUMPERDINCK
gripping his sword watching

HUMPERDINCK
-- and then my tongue I suppose
I killed you too quickly the last
time a mistake I dont mean to
duplicate tonight

WESTLEY
I wasnt finished -- the next
thing you lose will be your left
eye followed by your right --

HUMPERDINCK
(takes step forward)
-- and then my ears I understand
Lets get on with it

CUT TO
CLOSE UP WESTLEY HUGE
WESTLEY
Wrong Your ears you keep and
Ill tell you why --
CUT TO

HUMPERDINCK

And now he stops and the look that was in his eyes at the
wedding that look of fear is starting to return

WESTLEY
-- so that every shriek of every
child at seeing your hideousness
will be yours to cherish -- every
babe that weeps at your approach
every woman who cries out Dear
God what is that thing will
echo in your perfect ears

(MORE)

WESTLEY (CONTD)
That is what to the pain means
It means I leave you in anguish
wallowing in freakish misery
forever
CUT TO
HUMPERDINCK

doing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside
him

HUMPERDINCK
I think youre bluffing --

CUT TO
WESTLEY
lying there staring at him
WESTLEY
Its possible pig -- I might be
bluffing -- its conceivable you

miserable vomitous mass that Im
only lying here because I lack

the strength to stand -- then
again perhaps I have the strength
after all

And now slowly Westley begins to move His body turns his
feet go to the floor he starts to stand --

CUT TO
HUMPERDINCK
staring eyes wide

CUT TO
WESTLEY
And now he is standing sword in fighting position

WESTLEY
(slow and determined)
DROP-YOUR-SWORD

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

and hes so panicked he doesnt know whether to pee or wind
his watch He throws his sword to the floor

WESTLEY
(to Humperdinck)
Have a seat

CUT TO
WESTLEY
speaking to Buttercup as Humperdinck sits
WESTLEY
Tie him up Make it as tight as
you like
And as she sets to work --
CUT TO
INIGO
entering looking around
INIGO

Wheres Fezzik

WESTLEY
I thought he was with you

INIGO
No

WESTLEY
In that case --

his balance betrays him

INIGO
(to Buttercup)
Help him
BUTTERCUP

Why does Westley need helping

INIGO
Because he has no strength --
HUMPERDINCK
and now be starts wrestling mightily with his bonds

HUMPERDINCK
I knew it I knew you were
bluffing I knew he was bluffing

INIGO
(staring at the Prince)
Shall I dispatch him for you

WESTLEY
(considers this then)
Thank you but no -- whatever

happens to us I want him to live
a long life alone with his
cowardice

FEZZIK
(off-screen)
Inigo Inigo where are you

They look at each other then move to the balcony and
CUT TO
FEZZIK

leading FOUR GREAT WHITE HORSES He glances up sees them on
the balcony

FEZZIK

Ah there you are Inigo I saw
the Princes stables and there
they were four white horses And
I thought there are four of us
if we ever find the lad -- hello
lad -- so I took them with me in
case we ever bumped into each
other

(considers things a moment)
I guess we just did

CUT TO
INIGO AND WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP
looking down at FEZZIK

INIGO
FEZZIK you did something right

FEZZIK
Dont worry -- I wont let it go
to my head

And as he holds out his great arms--
CUT TO
SOMETHING UNEXPECTED AND VERY LOVELY

Buttercup floating through the air Whats happening of
course is that shes jumping from the balcony so Fezzik can
catch her But her fall is in slow motion so you might think
she was flying

Westley and Inigo watching as FEZZIK catches Buttercup

INIGO
You know its very strange -- I
have been in the revenge business
so long now that its over I
dont know what to do with the
rest of my life

WESTLEY
(as Inigo gets him
ready for his jump)
Have you ever considered piracy
Youd make a wonderful Dread
Pirate Roberts

Now from that --
CUT TO
THE FOUR GLORIOUS WHITE HORSES WITH THEIR FOUR RIDERS
triumphantly racing through the night --
CUT TO
BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY
and at last their trials are done They stop
GRANDFATHER
(off-screen)
They rode to freedom And as dawn
arose Westley and Buttercup knew
they were safe A wave of love

swept over them And as they
reached for each other
As Buttercup and Westley begin their ultimate kiss --
CUT TO

THE KIDS BEDROOM

The Grandfather stops reading

THE KID
What What

GRANDFATHER
No its kissing again You dont

want to hear it

THE KID
I dont mind so much

He gestures for his Grandfather to read

GRANDFATHER
Okay

CUT TO
BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY
locked in a deep pure and passionate kiss
GRANDFATHER
(off-screen)
Since the invention of the kiss
there have been five kisses that
were rated the most passionate
the most pure This one left them
all behind The end
CUT TO
THE KIDS ROOM

The Grandfather snaps the book closed

GRANDFATHER
Now I think you ought to go to
sleep

THE KID
Okay

GRANDFATHER

(standing readying to leave)
Okay Okay Okay All right So
THE KID
Grandpa

The Old Man stops turns

THE KID
Maybe you could come over and
read it again to me tomorrow

GRANDFATHER
(a beat)

As you wish

And his smile is enough As The Grandfather steps out the
door tipping his hat--

FINAL FADE OUT

THE END
