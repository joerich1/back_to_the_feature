Your first six months at the firm are
as a trainee you make one hundred
and fifty dollars a week After youre
done training you take the Series
Seven test When you pass you become
a junior broker and youll be opening
accounts for your team leader After
you open forty accounts you begin
working for yourself and then skys
the limit Now a word about being a
trainee The other brokers your
parents whoever theyre gonna give
you shit about it And its true a
hundred and fifty a week is not a lot
of money but pay no mind You need to
learn the business and this is the time
to do it Once you pass the Series
Seven none of it will matter

He pauses to drink
JIM (CONTD)
Your friends are shit Youre gonna
tell them you made twenty-five thousand
last month and theyre not going to
believe you Fuck them Your parents

you If you decide it isnt nothing
to be embarrassed about Its not for

Im really learning a lot Theyre
very thorough

NEIL
Are you gonna be rich Seth

SETH
I hope so

MOTHER
God willing

MARTY
I gotta ask you how come Ive never
heard of this firm

The question makes Seth nervous Familiar territory

SETH
Theyre a small firm Dad Theres a
million others just like it that youve
never heard of either

MARTY
I guess what Im asking is why you
didnt try and go straight to Goldman
Sachs or a company of that stature

MOTHER
Marty why are you starting

SETH

(calm)
Its okay Mom The reason Dad is
that the larger houses dont hire kids
straight out of college unless you went
to an Ivy League school or you want to
do cash-flow analysis for the next
fifteen years They want you to work
outside their firm for a couple of
years to get a sense of the
marketplace Thats why almost all
brokers start in small firms like JT
Marlin

MARTY

(to Mother)
See that wasnt so bad He answered
the question This is good stuff
Seth Good stuff So how does it feel
to have a real job

SETH
It feels real good Dad

Seth looks elated Theres a long content pause
MARTY
All you have to do now is close the

team wrote a million dollar ticket

quarter million dollar hit Besides

Rip Commission Thats why we work
here We get huge rips

SETH

share you sell Real money Jesus

first trade You service the client
right and hell be back for more Bide

return and hell trust you to watch his

least one decent suit There is a
minimum level of aesthetic
professionalism that we have here In

outfit your whole closet but for now
just get something to hold you over
Theres an important phrase that we use
here and I think its time you all
learned it Act as if Do you
understand what that means Act as if
you are the fucking president of this
firm Act as if you have a nine inch
cock Act as if To do this properly
you need to at least look the part So
go get dressed Secondly its time to
get your Series Seven books No need
to get nervous If you study youll
pass Then you begin trading as an SEC
licensed broker Then youre a fucking
millionaire Its that simple I need
three hundred from each of you for the
books which will be returned if and
when you pass the exam And Ill need
that tomorrow

Marlin How you doing this afternoon

HARRY
Fine thanks

SETH
You got a call from an associate broker
of mine last month and I just wanted to
know if you enjoyed the information we
sent you

HARRY
What information

SETH
If you get as much mail as I do you
probably brushed it aside but more
importantly we made a commitment to get
back to you I am presenting you with
an investment opportunity that I think
youll find very interesting

HARRY
Well thanks but Im not really in the
market for that right now

SETH
Tell me Harry are you married or

happy

Harry laughs at this remark He finds it genuinely funny

HARRY
Actually Ive been married for ten
years

SETH

Oh yeah Six years for me

HARRY
Theyre great arent they

SETH
Yeah they sure are So are you
playing the market at all

HARRY
Well I dont know about playing I do
own some blue chips They were
actually wedding gifts from our friends

explosive situation we have going on
right now A pharmaceutical company
Farrow Tech has a drug called Parattin

Seth kicks his chair hard enough to send him rolling

SETH
I would love to show you what I mean
and I can do so on a relatively small

HARRY
I really cant buy anything right now
Seth My wife and I are buying a house
this month and were saving every last
penny

SETH
Look I dont care how much stock you
pick up I just want you to test me
out Harry I want you to judge me on
the percentages I show you Obviously I
show you thirty or forty percent no
matter how big or small your position
is youre gonna get pretty excited
about my next idea right

HARRY
Well yeah

SETH
Of course you would Youd be handing
out my business cards wouldnt you

Harry laughs

SETH (CONTD)
Pick up one hundred shares Its the
absolute firm minimum Okay if I show
you three or four points on the trade
its not going to make you rich On
the same token if the stock doesnt go
anywhere youre not out in front of
your store with a cup in your hand

HARRY
(laughs)
No thats true

SETH

(serious)
Look Harry the truth is I could sell
you a lot more than one hundred shares
and feel completely comfortable about
the trade but Im asking you to start
small just to prove what I can do for
you

HARRY
Alright

SETH
Great Should I send the confirmation
to your business or your home

HARRY
Well I just have to talk to my wife
first Then Ill call you right back

decisions

Well of course

SETH
Alright well when you make one of
these decisions do you call your wife
to ask her what you should do

HARRY

(a little annoyed)
No of course not But thats a little
bit

SETH
Different How Its your money you
earned it Besides all youre doing
is investing it Im not selling crack
here Harry I mean shes only going
to be happy when she sees youve made a
wise investment for the family Just
think of the flip side
When your wife does the shopping does
she call you from Pathmark to ask you
if she can use the coupons for Captain
Crunch

HARRY
Come on thats not fair

SETH
Im just trying to make a point here
Harry Were not talking about a lot

to say when you bring her back a big
fat check because you had the foresight
to see a good thing coming

Things arent right at work Im sick
of opening accounts for Greg

DEBBIE (CONTD)
Theres something else Its your
father

SETH
yeah actually it is Were
finally getting along I mean were
having lunch next week on his request
Do you know how happy that shit makes
me

DEBBIE

SETH
But its all based on this fucking job
This very legitimate respectable job
A job he can tell his friends about
during the Yom Kippur appeal And its
all bullshit

DEBBIE
Then youll quit Youll tell him what
was happening and hell respect you for
walking away

SETH
I cant do that Ive invested too
much time and energy

Seth takes a deep breath here and stares at Debbie

DEBBIE
Talk to me Seth

SETH
I figured out how Michaels making his
money I almost wish I hadnt because
its all illegal

DEBBIE
It really is huh Well we knew it was
shady So hows he doing it

SETH

Its called bridge financing Its so
simple A group of investors make a
loan to a private company Lets say
for three million After the company
gets taken public they pay back a
million in cash and the other two they
pay back in common stock but at the
IPO price So the investors basically
get two million worth of IPO stock
Then they can sell it on the open
market at triple what they bought it
for Now thats actually all legal as
long as the investors are not tied to
the brokerage house But Michaels
friends are the investors on every IPO
we do

DEBBIE
Thats why all the names were the same
on the contracts

SETH
Right Then he has us push it all on
the open market Were selling
Michaels shares Thats where the two
dollar rips come in He can afford to
pay us that much Hes still in an
obscene profit margin Its to his
advantage to give us those rips He
has to motivate us to push these
stocks He depends on us to literally
create the market Its all artificial
demand Theres no other firm selling
this shit Thats why hes always
telling us to go into debt He wants
us hungry Then as soon as we sell off
Michaels position theres no need to
maintain the inflated price anymore

We stop pushing it and it crashes And
get this The last IPO Med Patent
its cardboard No research and
development no employees not even a
fucking building Annual reports are
all bullshit Michael manufactures
them Med Patent doesnt exist

Now I dont know Maybe now I go do
it for myself

started asking him buying questions
Like whats the firm minimum Thats
a buying question I ask a question
like that he should take me down
Its not like I asked him what his 800
number was Thats a fuck off
question I was giving him a run but
he blew it To a question like Whats
the firm minimum the answer is zero
You dont like the idea dont pick up
a single share This putz is telling
me

high and selling low Harry

HARRY
So whats going on Tell me why we
shouldnt just get out now

SETH
Alright heres the deal I told you
things would happen within sixty days
its only twenty so far but the
situation here is explosive and I
wanted to get you involved Thats why
I havent returned any calls Ive
been gathering information all morning
So here it is The stocks down for
tech reasons Its been on the
restricted list all week But its the
same company As a matter of fact
while it was on the restricted list
Farrow was doing nothing but signing
more contracts Im telling you its
looking like our next big one here
Hold on a second Harry

that we picked up at eight only now
its at four Now when it was at
eight I told you it was going to
twenty right

probably even higher now This doesnt
change anything except that youre
going to make more money than you did
before Look Harry I liked it at
eight I love it at four Its an
average down for you

HARRY
What

SETH
Dollar cost averaging If you own a
hundred shares at ten dollars and now
you buy another one hundred at five
thats a F200 shares at 750 a share
Your cost basis is lower Now if I get
you involved at ten and take you out at
fifteen youve made how many points
Harry

HARRY
Five

SETH
Exactly But if I get you involved at
seven and a half and I take you out at
fifteen well thats seven anda half
points thats even better
