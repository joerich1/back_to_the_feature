Scary THRASHING SOUNDS come from the trap Arlo prepares
himself with his big stick goes to investigate

The horrible thrashing sounds grow louder with each step Arlo
takes getting closer closer

struggling in the trap The critter is pissed off screaming
and fighting the trap

Suddenly the critter turns toward Arlo Arlo ducks back
down hiding in the brush

Arlo moves back toward the silo

But then Arlo swallows gets determined This is his job
He raises the stick over his head preparing for the kill

with Arlo

Arlo can’t do it he lowers the branch
Arlo moves to the side -- still well away from the critter --
and springs the trap The ropes fall from the critter and we

The boy just sits at the edge of the cliff watching as Arlo
ineptly gets up the cliff

Arlo lifts his head up over the ledge He uses his neck to
inch forward toward the boy

ARLO
This is all your fault

He bites at the boy trying to get ahold of him The boy
quietly watches Arlo’s struggle

ARLO
Get over here Get over here

Suddenly the boy tries to climb on Arlo’s face again

ARLO
Ah Get away Get AWAY GET AWAY
GET -- A -- WAY

Arlo jerks his neck tossing the boy back The boy tumbles
and then gets up looks at Arlo still unfazed The boy turns
and uses his hind legs to kick dirt in Arlo’s face

That’s it Arlo’s had it He rolls himself up the ledge ready
to fight But the boy is gone Human hand and foot prints
lead into the wilderness

ARLO
That’s right you better run

PSSHHHH The SOUND OF A GEYSER echoes through the wilderness
Arlo sees the geysers lining a far ridge The highest point

Arlo can see which means the best place to see his
surroundings

EXT RIDGE - CONTINUOUS
Arlo climbs to the top of the ridge the WIND WHISTLING
around him and he sees vast miles of unpopulated

wilderness

ARLO
Where am I

Arlo turns in circles his panic growing On all sides just
more wilderness

ARLO
Where’s home

He spots the river in the valley below him going on for
miles and miles and Arlo realizes

ARLO
As long as you can find the river
you can find your way home

Arlo starts his journey upriver

EXT RIVERS EDGE - DAY (LATER)

Arlo tired hungry following the river through the woods
He seems very small in this big world He looks for food but
finds nothing

SQUISH Arlo steps on berries scattered on the ground He
tastes the squashed fruit off his foot it’s pretty good
His stomach GROWLS Arlo looks up the hillside a BERRY TREE

EXT ROCKY SLOPEBERRY TREE - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

Arlo balances on a boulder trying to reach the berries
hanging high in a tree

The boulder tilts down the small incline Arlo almost loses
his balance but catches himself His hunger is making him
more daring He stretches his neck forward blowing on the
berries to get them to swing closer to him He tries to grab
them with his teeth Almost got them --

CRACK The boulder gives way tumbling down the slope Arlo
crashes to the ground BAM BAM

Arlo lays there stunned frustrated He picks himself up --
BUT HIS FOOT IS CAUGHT He pulls but it’s stuck fast between
boulders Arlo panics pulling harder but his foot won’t
budge

DISSOLVE TO

EXT ROCKY SLOPE - NIGHT
It’s dark now and Arlo is still stuck

We see Arlo’s panicked track marks all around the boulder
evidence of his day-long struggle to pull himself free

He curls up cold scared alone A scary animal ROARS from
the deep woods it’s something big What is out there

It CRIES OUT again Arlo is not safe out here He curls up
tighter just the moon for company

DISSOLVE TO

EXT ROCKY SLOPE - DAY

Arlo wakes up not sure for a moment where he is Then he
remembers looks at his foot but it’s free now the
earth dug out from under his foot Arlo is stunned

He sees human tracks in the dirt The same tracks he saw
around the silo and leading into the mountain pass

EXT RIVERS EDGEWOODLAND - DAY (LATER)

Arlo walking along the river through the wilderness He
limps still bruised from his fall

It starts to drizzle SOFT THUNDER Arlo keeps going -- but
quickly he is cold and shivering

WILDERNESS CRITTERS scurry across the ground The drizzle
turns into rain Arlo’s footprints become puddles
THUNDERCLAP

Arlo collects sticks to build a makeshift shelter But after
only propping up three sticks they tumble to the ground

Nearby creatures are nestled in their dwellings dry safe
Arlo notices one FURRY CRITTER sitting under an overhung
rock has taken particular interest in watching Arlo’s
efforts

Arlo tries positioning larger branches and has more success
He sits inside his shelter proud smiling at the critter
under the rock The critter keeps staring Arlo sticks his
tongue out at it DRIP DRIP SPLASH A puddle pours down
onto Arlo’s face

The critter squeaks as if laughing at Arlo It goes away and
comes back with TWO OTHER CRITTERS (implying “let’s watch
this”) They all squeak staring at Arlo Arlo groans
frustrated

Nearby shrubs RUSTLE Arlo sits up -- something is coming
toward him

Arlo looks out into the wilderness -- whatever it is it’s
getting closer

The bushes in front of Arlo move and there is the boy He
carries a stunned LIZARD in his mouth

ARLO
You again

The boy lays the lizard in front of Arlo

ARLO
Get outta here

The boy steps back a few paces looks at Arlo Arlo looks at
the stunned lizard in front of him What am I supposed to do
with that The boy looks at Arlo Waits

The lizard comes awake runs off

The boy growls at Arlo and leaves rushing back into the
brush

CUT TO
Arlo sleeping in his shelter The rain is much lighter now
The boy flies in on a BUG over Arlo’s head landing in the
brush The boy comes out dragging the huge ugly bug toward
Arlo The boy flips the bug on its back and signals for Arlo
to eat it

Arlo looks at the bug in front of him The head moving back
and forth Yuck

The boy notices Arlo looking at the bug’s pinchers and
slithering tongue so he rips the head off Then steps back --
“Okay now eat it”

Repulsed Arlo takes a branch brushes the bug’s body and
head to the side

The boy barks at Arlo runs off again
CUT TO

BERRIES ON A STICK dropped on the ground The boy runs off to
the side waits

Arlo’s so relieved He takes a small bite

ARLO
I told you to STAY AWAY
from me
He devours them The boy keeps an eye on Arlo as he climbs up
a nearby boulder his face showing no emotion It’s just a
fact you have to eat
The rain has stopped
ARLO
I am still going to squeeze
the life out of you

The berries are gone just the empty stick left Arlo turns
to the boy

ARLO
But before I do can you find me
some more

The boy just stares at him

ARLO
Uh here More of these

Arlo picks up the stick with his mouth The boy still stares

ARLO
You know um nom nom nom

Arlo pretends to chew the stick

The boy grabs the other end of the stick starts pulling it
He’s playing tug of war

ARLO
No no Stop What are you
doing
Arlo lets go the boy gnaws on the branch
Suddenly the boy takes off

ARLO
H-Hey wait

Arlo gets up sees the boy dashing away on all fours

ARLO

Arlo checks to make sure the river is in sight follows the

EXT CLIFF - CONTINUOUS

There’s a cliff wall ahead The boy jumps onto a nearby
leaning tree running across it like a squirrel He jumps
down to a ledge scampers up the cliff Arlo follows

ARLO
Where are you going

The ground beneath Arlo narrows each step becoming more
precarious as they make their way up the cliff Arlo presses
his body tightly against the wall Rocks crumble beneath him
tumbling to the ground far below

The boy stops The ledge ends with a huge gap to the other
side The boy thinks a moment

ARLO
I-I knew it I’m gonna die out here
because of you

The boy turns to Arlo starts pushing Arlo’s feet out from
underneath him Arlo stumbles trying to keep his balance

ARLO
Hey -- hey -- hey -- hey -- hey
what are you doing N-N-No s-stop

The boy gets behind Arlo and starts pushing him toward the
gap

ARLO
Hey hey NO STOP

The boy bites Arlo’s leg Arlo yelps losing his balance and
crashing forward He barely catches himself with his teeth
clinging to the opposing cliff edge He’s stretched out
across the gap the tip of his tail holding the other side

The boy scampers across him -- he’s made Arlo into a bridge
The boy climbs over Arlo’s face stepping on his eyes
ARLO
Ow OW Why you little come
back here
The boy sniffs ahead His body shivers his foot taps He’s

found something The boy looks back at Arlo happily panting
Now Arlo sees them too

Arlo is suddenly full of energy He drops his tail and
propels himself up the opposing ledge He runs toward the
berry bush

The boy starts to growl Arlo walks past him but the boy
jumps between Arlo and the berries growling fiercely

ARLO
What’s with you Th-they’re right
here

The boy just gets louder and louder Arlo pushes him away
with his foot

ARLO
Crazy critter

Arlo breaks off a branch with berries and a SERPENT-LIKE
CREATURE falls onto his face Arlo yelps in surprise and
falls off the ledge

EXT ASPEN TREE GROVE - CONTINUOUS

Arlo’s fall is broken by a patch of aspen trees below As he
stands up the snake rises up in front of him

Suddenly the boy jumps between Arlo and the snake The snake
lunges at the boy but the boy attacks it

The two have a vicious fight but the boy is tough breaks
free from the snake’s coil and head-butts the beast it
squirms away into the nearby brush

Arlo runs next to the boy for safety The boy shifts from
attack mode to happy canine looking up at Arlo Arlo smiles
back but then

The T rexes take off their legs like galloping horses --
their top halves calm and concentrated on following the
tracks of their herd

ON ARLO Gulp

He scoops up Spot chases after the T rexes

EXT BIG SKY COUNTRY - CONTINUOUS

The tracks have disappeared over a rise The T rexes stop
get on their bellies Arlo joins them belly crawling to the
edge of the rise

There below them out in Big Sky Country is the HERD OF
LONGHORNS

No sign of any other dinosaurs

ARLO

and big teeth

BUTCH
Don’t over think it

He pushes Arlo out into the field

Arlo with Spot on his back goes a few steps but does not
want to do this He glances back at the T rexes Butch nods -
— Gol

Arlo steels himself (does a “get over my fear” face) and
moves toward the herd He creeps through the grass looking
back again The T rexes are now gone Arlo continues

Arlo and Spot make it to the rock Arlo does his “get over my
fear” face again and climbs on top

He opens his mouth to roar NOTHING COMES OUT Just a
strangled whisper

Spot watches Arlo try again -- still nothing

Spot BITES Arlo HE SCREAMS

Suddenly Arlo sees something in the tall grass moving toward
him first one then another RUSTLERS COMING RIGHT AT
HIM

Arlo turns around -- BUBBHA a mean-looking Velociraptor
stares at him NOSE TO NOSE

BUBBHA
Howdy

Another rustler lunges out LURLEANE She seems rabid
gnashing her teeth and grunting

Something crawls up Arlo’s rock FROM BEHIND

Arlo turns sees Earl lunging at him Arlo closes his eyes

Butch leaps out of the grass and grabs Earl in midair

The other three Raptors leap into the air at Arlo but Nash
is there swipes them down

Arlo is stunned It’s like being in the middle of a bar

Arlo sees storm clouds cover the mountain pass The ground is
wet It is very similar to the day he and his father walked
into the pass

Lightning flashes Arlo flinches

ARLO

Nervous he backs away But then he sees something that makes

him stop

What looks like a shark fin cutting through the clouds above
him First one then another there are five of them
circling

CRACK Lightning flash We see the silhouettes of
Pterodactyls above the clouds

ON ARLO Oh no

Cackles echo across the pass

It all happens very fast The Pterodactyls dive down out of
