Good night Sweetheart

LITTLE BOY (0S)
Gnight Mom

FATHER (0S)
Sleep tight Kiddo

The bedroom light CLICKS off Soft moonlight illuminates the
room A little boy snuggles into bed as his parents’
footsteps fade away down the hall All is quiet

The closet door CREAKS open The boy looks around the room
nervously eyes growing wide Suddenly he spies a TENTACLE
emerging from the closet The boy turns away in fear but a
second look reveals it to be just a SHIRT SLEEVE He relaxes
back into bed

A DARK SHADOW cuts across the bedspread From under the bed
a pair of EVIL RED EYES peer out

Rising up behind the boy preparing to scare his young
victim towers a FEARSOME MONSTER

The boy sees the monster and SCREAMS

The monster horrified by the child lets out an even more
blood curdling SCREAM of his own

He backs away and slips on a soccer ball which ricochets off
the wall and beans him squarely on the face He stumbles
back onto a skateboard slips and lands on a pile of JACKS

Crazed with pain the monster runs around the room SQUEALING
and holding his backside

Worklights flash on flooding the room with light The boy
now revealed to be an ANIMATRONTIC winds down and resets

INT SIMULATORTRYOUT ROOM DAY

The bedroom is a set a simulator where monsters practice
their scare tactics
Behind a control console sits an evaluator the dragon-like
MS FLINT Judging by her tone she’s been through this
before

FLINT
(to our monster)
Alright Mr Bile is it

BILE
Uh my friends call me Phlegm

FLINT
Uh huh Mr Bile can you tell me what
you did wrong

BILE
I fell down

FLINT
No no before that Can anyone tell me
Mr Bile’s big mistake Anyone

Flint addresses a panel of pathetic looking RECRUITS seated
behind her They stare back at her blankly

FLINT (CONTD)
(frustrated)
Let’s take a look at the tape Here we

go
Flint rewinds the tape then plays it

ON THE MONITOR Bile sneaks into the bedroom leaving the
door open The image freezes

FLINT (cont’d)
Right there See The door You
left it wide open

RECRUITS BILE
Oooh

FLINT
And leaving a door open is the worst
mistake any employee can make because

- BILE
Um it could let in a draft

VOICE (0S)
IT COULD LET IN A CHILD

MR WATERNOOSE CEO of Monsters Inc steps from the shadows
FLINT
Oh Mr Waternoose

WATERNOOSE
There is nothing more toxic or deadly
than a human child A single touch could
kill you

Bile shuffles nervously away from the animatronic kid

WATERNOOSE (cont’d)
Leave a door open and a child could walk
right into this factory Right into the
monster world

One recruit loses it leaping into the lap of the monstet
next to him

RECRUIT
I wont go in a kids room You cant
make me

Waternoose grabs a nearby yellow SCREAM CAN

WATERNOOSE
You’re going in there because we need

this

He uncorks the can and the sound of CHILDREN’S SCREAMS leak
out The lights SURGE and monitors CRACKLE The recruits
cover their ears

Waternoose corks the can

WATERNOOSE (cont’d)
Our city is counting on you to collect
those children’s screams Without
screams we have no power Yes it’s
dangerous work and that’s why I need you
to be at your best I need Scarers who
are confident Tenacious Tough
Intimidating I need Scarers like
like James P Sullivan

child may have escaped

RANDALL
Yeah well until we know for sure we’re
gonna act like nothing happened

and running I’11l take care of the kid

Were in the human world Oh what a
great idea going to your old pal
Waternoose Too bad he was in on the
whole thing All you had to do was
listen to me just once But you didn’t

Sullivan desperately runs his hands along the sides of the
door looking for anything that might activate it

MIKE (CONTD)

Youre still not listening

Mike leaps onto Sullivans back sending both of them
tumbling down the side of the snowy mountain

Aaaaaaaaaah

Mike continues to pound at Sullivan as they flip over an
embankment landing with a THUD several yards below

mittens on his horns hands and feet

Why can’t they call me the “adorable
snowman” Or the “agreeable” snowman for
crying out loud I’m a nice guy

Snowcone

The Yeti holds out a tray of yellow snowcones

MIKE —

Yeech
YETI
Oh no no no Don’t worry It’s

(to Sullivan)
How about you big fella Snowcone

Sullivan sits at the mouth of the cave staring at his hands

SULLIVAN
(muttering to himself)
Did you see the way she looked at me

In anguish he buries his face in his hands

YETI
-Oh poor guy I understand It ain’t
easy being banished Take my buddy
Bigfoot When he was banished he
fashioned an enormous diaper out of
poison ivy and wore it on his head like a
tiara Called himself “King Itchy”

Mike looks up at Yeti as though he’s insane

lucky can you get Banished with your
best friend

MIKE
He is not my friend

YETI
Oh I just assumed you were buddies

(yelling to Sullivan)
A stupid kid Because of you I am now
stuck in this frozen wasteland

YETI
Wasteland I think you mean w and
I mean how ‘bout all this fabulous snow

milk

For the first time Sullivan turns his eyes alive

SULLIVAN
What did you say

YETI
Uh yak’s milk Milking-a yak ain’t
exactly a picnic but you know once you
pick the hairs out it’s very nutritious

Sullivan jumps up runs across the cave and grabs the Yeti

No no something about a village
Where Are there kids in it

kids who climb on rocks
This diversion is more that Sullivan can handle
SULLIVAN
WHERE IS IT

At the bottom of the mountain around a
three day hike

SULLIVAN

Sulley PUNCHES the wall in frustration sending A PIECE OF
ICE across the floor It stops in front of a PILE OF HIKER
PARAPHERNALIA piled in the corner of the cave

Sulley’s eyes light up He has an idea
Yeti watches as Sullivan digs through the stuff

YETI
You wanna go to the village Okay rule

SULLIVAN
(focused on his task)
We need to get to Boo

A SNOWBALL hits Sullivan in the back Yeti points to Mike
nervously -- he did it

ignored everything I’ve said And now

MIKE (CONTD)
And what about me I’m your pal I’m

Sullivan stops at the mouth of the cave and turns around

SULLIVAN
I’m sorry Mike I’m sorry were stuck

there might be a way to save her If we
can just get down to that--

There is nothing Sullivan can say He turns and pushes the
toboggan out of the cave

The cave grows dark Mike stares in disbelief Sullivan is

gone

Sullivan RACES down the mountainside on his makeshift sled

The LANTERN dangles from a ski pole on the sled lighting the

The sled narrowly missing boulders and picking up speed
until

SULLIVAN
Whoa

Sullivans sled SMASHES into a boulder and bursts apart He
tumbles down the mountainside finally sliding to a stop
face down in the snow

Sulley lies motionless in the snow the wind howling through
his fur

A child SCREAMS in the distance Or was that the wind
Sullivan slowly lifts his head

Another SCREAM this one louder than the first Sullivans
eyes widen

Through the snow Sullivan can barely make out a SMALL

INT CHILD’S BEDROOM
A kid sleeps in bed Soft moonlight illuminates the room

‘A shadow cuts across the bedsheets The silhouette of a
large horned creature rises up over the bed

The kid sees the monster and GASPS

The kid turns on a light revealing Mike sitting on a stool
microphone in hand

The kid looks on sceptically That was worse than the last
joke Mike knows he’s dying

MIKE (cont’d)
Alright

Mike stands up tosses the microphone in his mouth and
SWALLOWS IT Amplified STOMACH GURGLES are heard while he
waits He finally lets out a HUGE BURP projecting the
microphone out of his mouth and catching it

MIKE (CONT’D)

The kid begins HOWLS with laughter Mike grabs his stool and
heads for the closet door

MIKE
Not bad huh You know only somebody
with perfect comedic timing could produce
this much energy in one shot

SULLIVAN
Uh huh And the fact that laughter is
ten times more powerful than scream had
nothing to do with it

Mike clears his throat sheepishly

A monster inserts CHATTERING TEETH into his mouth as he walks
into a closet door

Fungus puts on a pair of THREE-EYED GROUCHO GLASSES

FUNGUS
Oh this is great

George walks by carrying a watermelon and a mallet

Thaddeus Bile backs out of a door JACKS sticking from his
butt Laughter emanates from the kid’s room filing the
tank Satisfied Bile bounces a soccer ball and smiles

Sullivan makes his way to the end of the hall He surveys
the fruit of his labors

LAUGHTER emanates from all the doors Workers happily move
giant scream cans tell each other jokes juggle and enjoy
themselves

A GRAPH on Sullivan’s clipboard shows FIRST YEAR PROFITS
going through the roof

But Sulley’s smile fades Taped to the clipboard backing is
the now tattered PICTURE Boo drew of herself and Sulley
Below is the WOODEN CHIP from her door

The door is clearly missing a piece Sullivan looks down to
his clip board where the sliver of Boo’s door is taped

Sullivan fits the piece into the door It fits perfectly
The red light above the door glows

Mike smiles and steps aside

Sullivan reaches for the door-knob
