Effigies of Jimmy Carter and the deposed Shah -- crowds

An IRANIAN STUDENT films the scene with a Super 8 camera

2 EXT EMBASSY GROUNDS - MORNING 2

From INSIDE THE EMBASSY GATES we can hear the noise of
the protest There are three primary buildings on

traps and steel bars on the windows of the consulate

Standing on a chair looking at the protest outside the

The PROTEST in front of the gate is getting rowdier --
its energy and numbers swelling

A group of STUDENTS -- these more brisk organized all
bearded and dressed in flak jackets -- push their way to
the front of the protest --
WOMEN raise a banner Its a signal

As if on cue the IRANIAN POLICE move from the gates A
WOMAN removes a large pair of bolt cutters from
underneath her chador -- hands them to a BEARDED STUDENT
-- who gets to work on the CHAINS holding the gate

CLOSED --
When one YOUNG MAN wearing a green military field jacket
raises his fist we can see that he has a concealed
PISTOL in his clothes
More STUDENTS climbing the wall -- dropping the 12 feet
to the other side one after another
