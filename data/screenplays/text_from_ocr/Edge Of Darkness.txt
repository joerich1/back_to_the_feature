EXT THE CONNECTICUT RIVER PRE-DAWN

LATE WINTER ICE floats on the black water The water level is
high the current whorling among the black boles of trees
half submerged along the banks

EXT THE STREET NEAR SOUTH STATION LATER

Its getting darker CRAVEN takes change out of his pocket
and puts it into the slot on the parking meter He cant see
the slot very well His eyes aren’t what they were

We see his car an old yellow VALIANT It has unpainted steel
sheets riveted or spotwelded on over the rusted areas of the
fenders Craven clearly does not care about certain forms
of appearances

He wanders back towards the station entrance and waits
hands in his coat pocket
te

We are on his face as he sees his daughter (in a burst of
other arrivees from Springfield MA) come through the

GLASS DOORS OF THE TERMINAL

EMMA CRAVEN is in her middle twenties and there is no
mistaking that she was the girl in the silent videos The
same coppery hair She walks towards her father smiling

EMMA
Hi Dad

CRAVEN
Howaya

Out of the corner of his eye he sees a ROSE-SELLER and
realizes he might have got one for his daughter But hes
missed another one donkey

He gives her a kiss on the cheek Awkward In panicked shy
adoration And takes her duffel Her other luggage her
BACKPACK is on her shoulders

CRAVEN (CONTD)
You look tired

EMMA
(shrugging lying looking
at him)
Rough trip

She seems already to have something to say to her dad
something worrying her but she says nothing Finally she
smiles

EMMA (CONTD)
Daddy

CRAVEN blushes
CRAVEN
Thats right I am
(looks at her holding
her)
Lets get home
EXT BOSTON EARLY EVENING

RAIN is falling on the city Neon lights smoke in the rain
INT A STAR MARKET NEAR HUNTINGTON AVENUE EVENING

Exterior of an urban supermarket street people sheltering
under the overhang as the rain comes down

INT STAR MARKET CONTINUOUS

CRAVEN is shopping like an Irishman PORK CHOPS a bag of
POTATOES ONIONS BUTTER MILK BREAD Orange juice for
vitamins He hesitates in front of the mysterious PREPARED
SALAD section He reaches out as if the salad might be toxic
and unfolding his reading glasses reads the label carefully
Uncertainly he puts SALAD in the cart He starts to leave
the vegetable section and looks gloomily at ASPARAGUS He
grabs some and flees

EXT STAR MARKET MOMENTS LATER

CRAVEN comes out carrying his purchases running through the
rain and when nearly at his car he sees

EMMA bent over beside the open passenger door of the car
vomiting He runs to her He pulls off his raincoat and holds
it over her head protecting her from the rain

CRAVEN
Are you all right

She nods gasps Its as if shes actually drowning in the
rain

CRAVEN (CONT’D)
Are you all right

She nods holding her hair away from the vomit On CRAVENs
concerned face

CUT TO
INT EXT JAMAICAWAY CRAVENS CAR NIGHT

The traffic is heavyish and slow in the rain Winding past
the scarred oak trees which lean into the road with nailed-
on reflector strips CRAVEN shifting his three on the tree
looks at EMMA and finally cant keep silent

CRAVEN
You know there are things you can
tell me I’m not as bad at
communication as you might think
Ive lived in the world

She looks at him loving her Dad

a

EMMA
I’m not pregnant

The very idea

CRAVEN
No no I wasnt saying that
(though he was A long
beat )
Are you seeing someone

EMMA
Yes

CRAVEN
Someone with a name

EMMA
(she looks out the window
at the passing lights)
You wouldn’t like him

CRAVEN accepts this as logical Odds are he would not But
with genuine interest

CRAVEN
How do you know

(Its as if hes praying Let me learn how to be closer)
EMMA doesnt answer that but

EMMA
I wish you had someone

CRAVEN
(broadly)

Who says I don’t have some honey
stashed somewhere

She looks at him

EMMA
Me

He drives shifts He takes her hand and kisses it

CRAVEN
Youre my girl

He puts her hand down Drives He looks over a moment later
to see that EMMA is silently weeping

Instead of asking anything--this man is a Boston Irish
Catholic of the lace curtain variety--he drives and leaves
her daughter as private in her pain as he is in his own
Wipers beating

CRAVENS CAR enters the rotary in Jamaica Plain Red
taillights swerve slowly around the roundabout past mock-
Tudor mansions

EXT CRAVENS HOUSE NIGHT

His car is parked on not a driveway but two concrete tire
strips between a house directly next door His house is what
you might call an urban Victorian A small house but ornate
Guilty of stained glass Dating about 1910

At the end of the street where it joins Washington Street
Roslindale GANGBANGERS stand around in a wash of neon

INT CRAVENS HOUSE LANDING NIGHT

EMMA her face no longer tear-streaked but still puffy is
looking at an object on a bookshelf on the landing She
reaches out her fingers to it

DETAIL

It is an object from her childhood a CAST-IRON STAG Her
fingers touch the rough iron coat It is something she
remembers from earliest childhood

That stag This landing This sound of rain in this silent
house EMMA looks around in a kind of afterlife wonderment
wondering how that past became this present Off we hear WBZ
ACCU-WEATHER FORECAST

INT KITCHEN CONTINUOUS

A bakelight AM RADIO plays as CRAVEN in his yellow kitchen
unchanged in any detail since perhaps 1960 drains boiled
spuds and mashes them with milk and butter PORK CHOPS are
ready to go into the pan with a little onion He is precise
maybe even a little bit of a fuddy-duddy Craven was trained
early on the toilet He pees sitting down He looks around as
EMMA comes in EMMA notices the yogurt and salad
andasparagus

She holds up the ASPARAGUS

CRAVEN
Yeah well I

She kisses him She sniffles Gets a knife and cuts the ends
off the asparagus She really does not feel well Stops
cutting

EMMA
You finally got a vegetable and I
dont know if I can eat it

She sits down CRAVEN is a man whose wife died young

CRAVEN
Youre all right youve been to
the doctor right

EMMA
Whens the last time you went

CRAVEN

EMMA
Thats right They make you

She lifts a ceramic CAKE COVER with a rooster for a handle
off a dish on the table and reveals CRAVENS SERVICE PISTOL
WALLET BADGE

CRAVEN
Howd you get time off from work

EMMA sits for a moment without answering

EMMA

EMMA

CRAVEN puts the PORK CHOPS in the pan

CRAVEN

ale It will settle your stomach
EMMA nods

CRAVEN (CONT‘D)

He goes to the fridge an actual frigidaire immaculate and
yellowed and when he turns

EMMA has vomited through her fingers He drops the plastic
gingerale bottle and goes to her with a dishtowel

CRAVEN (CONTD)
(cleaning her up)
Listen I want you to go upstairs
and lie down Ill bring you what
you need okay You go lie down

She nods crying defiled with vomit

CRAVEN (CONTD)
You go lie down sweetheart

Her shirtsleeve has rucked up a bit and we see as Craven
sees A TATTOO OF A BLACK FLOWER on her left shoulder He
notices it (and when Craven notices something he notices
it) doesnt mention it

CRAVEN (CONTD)
Just go upstairs dont worry about
it you go Do you want me to help
you

She shakes her head

EMMA
Daddy

CRAVEN

EMMA

I think I better go to the doctor

CRAVEN
You have to tell me what

EMMA
I have to go to the doctor
INT CRAVENS HOUSE LATER

CRAVEN moving fast with his coat on grabs KEYS and WALLET
He leaves his PISTOL EMMA in her coat ashen shaking is
already standing near the front door looking out through the
frosted VICTORIAN glass at the rain the street of houses
mostly converted into apartments

CRAVEN comes along jingling his keys his change in his
pockets He opens the dark-stained door turning the top
lock and escorts EMMA through onto the porch

EXT PORCH CONTINUOUS

CRAVEN turns to close the door and lock the deadbolt with his
key At that moment

A VOICE CRAVEN

CRAVEN turns in time to see
A MASKED GUNMAN fire both barrels of a shotgun THROUGH EMMA

The window beside his head blows out Craven and what remains
of the glass is covered with blood

EMMA staggers backwards and CRAVEN catches her There is no
impulse to chase the manwhy would there be EMMA is blown
apart gargling on blood CRAVEN looks up desperately as the
GUNMAN runs away down the road but theres no thought of
chasing him He looks down at his ruined daughter hes a
cop he knows shes done Her hand bats at his face She is
trying to breath talk

CRAVEN
Youre my girl

EMMA
I know

She convulses and dies CRAVEN screams He lays her down
gently and runs in a circle He picks her up again He puts
her down and starts to do chest compressions but it is
clearly too late He holds her against him

CRAVEN

hand and smears it on his face And holds his dead daughter

INT AN APARTMENT HALLWAY AFTERNOON

A baby crying somewhere in the building CRAVEN uses one of
Emmas keys on the door of apartment four

INT THE APARTMENT CONTINUOITUS

CRAVEN pushes the door open slowly revealing a kitchen to
the left a bathroom and back door to a fire escape To the
right a hallway a warren of rooms carved out of the attic
and turret of an old victorian The apartment has knob and
tibe wiring warped windows paint spatters It reminds you
how old Massachusetts is how European how utterly not like
the rest of the country

CRAVEN closes the door behind him Seeing that the rear
window has been punched out above the doorknob he pulls his
pistol He moves--we follow him-- through what is revealed as
a totally ransacked apartment Mattresses shredded

Drawers pulled out and capsized Pictures taken down and
frames smashed CRAVEN finds the ends of some wires

Her computer and hard drives are gone
He lies on her trashed bed

He lights another cigarette and continues to go through
Emmas things He finds a vibrator For a minute he doesnt
know what it is He nearly reacts and the thought that men
searching his house found thisHe continues picking up
things from the mess on the floor PHOTOGRAPHS of BURNHAM and
EMMA together He puts them in his pocket

EXT SUGARLOAF MOUNTAIN AFTERNOON

SUGARLOAF MOUNTAIN is one of many mountains or hills called
Sugarloaf but this one with its observatory on top is the
one where the Indian King Phillip watched the British army
come out of Boston for him in 1675 One can see for miles
down the Connecticut Valley For our purposes it is the
Northmoor Facility A fortress The CONNECTICUT RIVER runs
past its base We come closer and see the wire fences the
barbed wire the PUMP HOUSE that would convey river water
into the facility

EXTINT CRAVENS CAR LATER

CRAVEN sits in his parked car across from the gates of the
Northmoor Facility Crash barriers force the workers now
leaving the premises to zigzag out onto the road There are
no sign of heavily armed guards but CRAVEN sees

What might be concrete camouflaged bunkers above the road
that climbs the hill

CRAVEN realizes that he necessarily must be photographed if
he lingers He puts his car in gear

EXT AN ICE CREAM SHOP TWILIGHT

An ice cream shop with a view of sugarloaf CRAVEN is sitting
with a coffee Not looking at sugarloaf coronaed with
blazing sunset behind him Across the road fields blazing
with light Tobacco barns

CRAVEN
This was a nice place to live
(drinks coffee)
I never came out

EMMAS VOICE
You never liked new experiences

CRAVEN
No I never did

Now imitating Cravens accent

EMMAS VOICE

INT EMMAS APARTMENT NIGHTHALLUCINATED MORNING

CRAVEN sits at the kitchen table wedged into its alcove and
looks out at the kitchen Hallucination morning light EMMA
(her age at time of death) passes by

CRAVEN watches as she walks back and forth doing her morning
routine getting ready to go to work Sometimes she passes by
him at the table when he is thinking not watching He
watches her with her mug of tea (perhaps put the MILK into
into play) watches her put her coat on watches her go out
the back door onto the fire escape porch

CRAVEN
Have a nice day sweetheart

He gets up looks around the thrashed apartment NIGHT

CRAVEN a nonsmoker for perhaps many years has obtained
cigarettes He unwraps them puts one in his mouth He looks
at the DUFFEL on the bed His suitcoat is folded across a
corner of the bed He is in shirtsleeves his pancake
holstered pistol visible

He opens the duffel and removesa damp bundle of
clothingmildewed not smelling very good muddy boots
which he examines a flashlight and a folded hand-drawn map
which could be of anywhere Its a map for someone who knows
a location anyway Its unintelligible Arrows He finds a
clip of bullets which -yes-does fit the gun that Emma was
carrying And then he findsa Geiger counter He finds the
switch and turns it on It registers a mild response He
tosses it down on his folded jacket and it SHRIEKS He pulls
it away from his jacket it falls silent He moves it back
and the instrument squeals The response is to something in
the breast pocket of his coat He reaches into the pocket and
removes

The generous figure of DARIUS JEDBURGH rises from the bunker
He smiles at MILLROY a tense man in a dark blue suit and
phone headset who is waiting for him

MILLROY
T wouldnt know I’ve never played
the game I havent dared to have
sex since Clinton sold missile
technology to the Chi-Coms

JEDBURGH eyes his putt

JEDBURGH
Chinese dont golf Theyre very
tense Got little dicks too
thats why theyre dangerous I
think Im probably number one on
their hit list

MILROY
Ever been to Boston

JEDBURGH
I try to stay on this side of the
Potomac I fight for the South
(a beat examining his
lie)
I have a handicap of four Millroy
You know what that means

MILROY
I have no idea what that is but I
hope it lets you use the special
parking spaces

JEDBURGH
What can I do for you Millroy

MILLROY
What do you do generally Jedburgh

JEDBURGH maybe doesnt like to think about what he does
generally He sinks his putt Dink He straightens

Generally at this juncture I have a
drink
INT 19TH HOLE BAR LATER

JEDBURGH looks at a blown up ID photo of EMMA

Emma Craven MIT in nuclear
science

JEDBURGH

You didnt say top of her class
Millroy We usually surf in your
world of resume cliche You have
referred to your own wife as summa
cum laude At what I would
hesitate to guess

MILLROY
In point of fact Emma Craven was
not at the top of her class The
verdict on Emma Craven is that she
was extremely bright and extremely
disinterested inoutward
distinctions

JEDBURGH
You do understand that the very
intelligent usually are
uninterested in gold stars and
fucking bulishit

MILLROY flushes

MILLROY
Is this about your continued
eriticism of my middle class matrix
of perception or is it about
national security

JEDBURGH takes a long drink

JEDBURGH
At this stage of my life its about
whatever the hell I say it is
Millroy

MILLROY
Brilliant scientist but bored by
science and mathematics Her honors
counselor predicted that she would
never work in her apparent field
and he was right until two years
ago after a sabbatical she put
herself on the nuclear research
market and was snapped up by
Northmoor in Massachusetts

JEDBURGH
Whats Northmoor

MILLROY
Its an American based RandD
subsidiary of Hollander-North
Enormous multinational Northmoor
Massachusetts based has two sites
one of them a particle accelerator
one of them even more hush
hushthats where she worked
has no less than twenty four
Defense Department contracts and
licenses

Very little of what they do is
unclassified Most of it very
classified

JEDBURGH

MILLROY
Were not sure what side she batted
for

JEDBURGH

You mean shes a carpet layer

MILROY

I dont believe so But if she is
shes a dead carpet layer now She
was shot dead three nights ago

there is one main building a concrete structure simply the
entrance to a facility largely underground in the hollowed
out hill Some workers are having lunch at picnic tables
under the trees or having their constitutionals on a path
that goes around the facility

EXT THE GATE LATER

CRAVEN stands looking at the facility A man in a suit

him come BENNETT is more salesman than scientist He has
something of Steve Jobs about him A brilliantly well-made
suit

BENNETT
Detective Craven Jack Bennett Im
sorry for your loss

CRAVEN
Thank you

BENNETT
Can I say how shocked we were to
hear of Emma’s death She was a

valued member of our team I cant
Say that I knew your daughter very
well personally But she is well
thought of She is missed

CRAVEN nods inarticulate at this

EXT A BALCONY OF THE MAIN BUILDING LATER

An incredible view of the Connecticut River valley BENNETT
and CRAVEN stand together

BENNETT
It was from this hill that the
Indian King Metacomet the chap
behind King Phillips War watched
the English army come out from
Boston in 1675 This was his
stronghold Until it wasnt Do you
know about King Phillips war

CRAVEN
I went to school when we still had
education yeah

BENNETT
Bloodiest war per capita in
American history and no one knows
about it Phillip was betrayed by a
praying Indian and shot dead
Massachusetts cut his body into
quarters The head was displayed at
Boston The rest of him was hung
from trees or given away as
souvenirs

Is there a point to this CRAVEN examines BENNETT

BENNETT (CONTD)

(a beat)
In the Sixties this hill was
excavated it was a site for Nike

wife and two children the eldest a daughter not much younger
than Emma

BENNETT (CONT’D)
How can I help you

CRAVEN
I suppose I want to know what Emma
was doing here

Beat Too brightly

BENNETT
In what sense

CRAVEN notices but

CRAVEN
When your child dies you realize
there are conversations you should
have had

BENNETT
She never told you about her work

CRAVEN
Perhaps because she observed
security protocol

BENNETT
And what is that In your
understanding
CRAVEN
She didnt talk about work
(a beat)

She had a badgea security
badge This is a tech facility

BENNETT
Right Well youll understand that
most of what we do is classified
and the rest tends to be trade
secrets Extremely expensive ones
What she didDespite her
qualifications your daughter was a
trainee What we call an intern
She did filing That sort of thing
Of course she was a full employee
there was a benefit packagewhich
I suppose you should see Personnel
about

CRAVEN
Im not interested in that just
yet

BENNETT
All our people are very well
insured

CRAVEN whose daughters hair just set off a geiger

counter

CRAVEN
I bet they are

BENNETT
Well What we do here Northmoor is
essentially a research facility We
have a mandate from government to
develop a safe and clean energy
source based on fusion technology
Very green

CRAVEN
And weapons

Fluently swinging in his chair

BENNETT
What about them

CRAVEN
You make them don’t you

BENNETT
Tf we did it would be classified
I can tell you because youre a
policeman and have access to this
information anyway that Northmoor
is an important part of the
nation’s SSandM program

Craven looks at him wanting some elaboration

BENNETT (CONTD)
Stockpile Stewardship and
Maintenance It’s our
responsibility to ensure that the
nation’s nuclear stockpile remains
ready for the President’s order
Not weapons butraw materials
This is a very secure facility
Hardened facility

CRAVEN
Was Emma a part of this

BENNETT
God no As an intern she didn’t
have a direct involvement in SSandM
She worked on the research floors

CRAVEN
May I see where she worked

BENNETT
Im afraid I cant do that Ill be
as hospitable as I can but this is
a secure facility As you
understand We all very much very
much regret Emmas death It must
be especially painful in the
circumstances

CRAVEN
You mean that she was shot instead
of me

BENNETT
As a parent I can guess at your
pain I think Though I am sure I
cannot imagine its full dimensions

CRAVEN
I wont take up any more of your
time Id like to talk to some of
her friends If any

BENNETT
Ill tell personnel Ill see what
I can do Well get you a list
Contact numbers So forth Can I
ask you a question

CRAVEN nods

BENNETT (CONTD)
What does it feel like

CRAVEN doesnt answer

BENNETT (CONT’‘D)
What does it make you want to do

CRAVEN
To be dead with her Afterwards

BENNETT
After what

CRAVEN
After I take care of a few things

BENNETT
I suppose thats a fathers
thought

CRAVEN nods He stands

BENNETT (CONT‘D)
We didnt know about the
arrangements We would have sent
flowers Ill call Personnel
Theres some paperworkyou can
deal with it later as you
wishand theyll take you back

up

CRAVEN
Is there any chance that your
security people turned over her
apartment

BENNETT
Turned over What do you mean

CRAVEN
Searched it

ie

CONTINU

BENNETT
There are circumstances in which
that would be imaginablebut she
had an unblemished record here
Detective Craven So far as I know

CRAVEN
If someone doesnt have an
unblemished recordwho does the
searching

BENNETT
Thats classified

CRAVEN stands and looks at BENNETT

BENNETT (CONTD)
If theres anything I can do

CRAVEN
I dont know What can you do

BENNETTS eyes wander over his rogues gallery of influential
people

BENNETT
You might be surprised Help

WHITEHOUSE

You got no buzz off this guy

What do you think about him being a

Im curious about it

Youre awfully calm Tom

It doesnt do me any good to be any

EXT A STREET OF THREE DECKERS IN REVERE MORNING

A SWAT TEAM the heavy mob goes into the first floor
apartment No waiting

INT BUONAROTE APARTMENT CONTINUOUS

The team comes across BUONAROTE in his underwear at least
three days dead executed with two in the hat while kneeling
in front of his couch with his hands tied behind his back

A LADY OFFICER coming late into the room accidentally rips
off a three-burst from her automatic weapon and everybody
hits the deck Cop fuck-up

COP AND RADIO ADLIBS
What the fuckwhat the fuck was
that

INT BUONAROTE APARTMENT LATER
CRAVEN stands staring at the corpse Buonarote has a crewcut

head shattered CRAVEN runs his hand over it thoughtfully
He looks at the stubbly backgrowth on the neck

WHITEHOUSE
Whats the matter

CRAVEN
Nothing

WHITEHOUSE

Youre looking at something Tell
me what youre looking at

CRAVEN
In the evidence log it said the
hair you found was two and a half
inches

WHITEHOUSE
So he cut his hair

CRAVEN
Well Not recently as a week ago

WHITEHOUSE stares

WHITEHOUSE
So what are you saying

CRAVEN
Not saying anything Hair can stick
to a hat for a long time Years
Decades

CRAVEN stares down at the dead man

WHITEHOUSE
Why would a pro blow off two
barrels of a shotgun instead of
saving one for his target

CRAVEN
A hitter can make a mistake
Everybodys an asshole Why does a
deli clerk get his hand caught in a
slicer Why does a guy driving a
car drop a lit cigarette through
his open fly and run over a nun
Why do half the people in the world
get married Why is there no Roman
Empire They fucked up

WHITEHOUSE
So who wanted you dead And then
killed the killer

CRAVEN here could tell his friend she was carrying a gun
Her apartment was tossed She was the target But he doesnt

CRAVEN
I wouldnt put the two things
together Guy like this has any
number of reasons to get dead

SYRINGES works on a kitchen counter

WHITEHOUSE
Did you do it

CRAVEN
I was in Western Mass I didnt
know this guy existed But thanks
for asking So far all youve
connected to my daughter is a hat
with a hair in it Maybe somebody
borrowed his hat

WHITEHOUSE
Well I need you in the rooms now

CRAVEN
-Ill probably come in tomorrow

WHITEHOUSE
Time for you to come in and think
at the department Cause between
you and me the rest of us aint so
good at it

EXT CRAVENS REAR YARD - NIGHT

Craven wears heavy gloves as he pours petrol on the back pack
and the pile of clothing He strikes a match and lights the
pile

He steps back and watches the flames rise The dosimeter
shrinks and melts with the heat

Craven removes the lock of Emma’s hair he hesitates then
throws it into the flames We hold on Craven’s face in the
darkness He turns and we see

A MAN sitting on the back steps
JEDBURGH

JEDBURGH
Public burning is illegal

CRAVEN
So is trespassing And creeping up
on a bereaved man at a murder scene
is not very bright

We see that CRAVEN backlit by the fire is holding his
pistol low

JEDBURGH

taking out and lighting a

cigar)
In the circumstances youd be
forgiven if you shot me Even in
the Peoples Republic of
Massachusetts Where if you are
threatened you must wait in hope
fortified with prayer for the duly
constituted authorities to arrive
fail to understand and fuck
everything up Even the cops suffer
these constraints I imagine And
sometimes wish to avoid them

(shakes out match)
You smoke cigars

CRAVEN shakes his head no

JEDBURGH (CONTD)
Theres a secret about cigars Even
the best ones are like burning
dogshit Craven we’ve got things
to talk about

CRAVEN
Like what

A long beat

JEDBURGH’S VOICE
Like who shot your daughter

Craven is silent

CRAVEN
Do you know who shot my daughter
JEDBURGH
No Im anxious to find out
(beat)

I know you dont smoke It mentions
the fact on your DARPA file

CRAVEN holding the gun on Jedburgh reaches into Jedburghs
coat and comes up with his wallet He looks at it Just a
Virginia drivers license

Stand the fuck up JEDBURGH stands up as ordered

CRAVEN sits down beside Jedburg holsters his

CRAVEN (CONTD)
Why do I have a DARPA file

JEDBURGH
Because your daughter was flagged
as a possible terrorist threat to
the United States of America

CRAVEN
Funny the Boston Police Department
didnt come up with that

JEDBURGH
No it isnt funny at all

watches the stuff burn in the ancient burning barrel

NEIGHBOR (0S)
What the fuck are you burning over
there Jesus fucking CHRIST

A window slams down

JEDBURGH
The term terrorist is loosely
applied these days Say someone
decided to run a check on say a
person with a security clearance
who had come under suspicion of
some kind A person of suspicion
Anyone and everyone can get the
whole nine yards Your daughter got
it And we dont know why

CRAVEN
Who pulled the report on her

pistol and

JEDBURGH
Unknown But some agent or agency
did Without identifying
themselves These days you dont
need to

CRAVEN
Who are you Mr Jedburgh

JEDBURGH
I may or may not be associated with
a government agency

INT CRAVENS KITCHEN NIGHT

CRAVEN pours out a whiskey for Jedburgh Jedburgh looks at
his watch and then takes the time to take a number of pills

JEDBURGH
Age is a terrible thing Pills
pills pills Not like it was in
youth when it was pills pills pills
in a very different context I bet
you never were a partier

CRAVEN stares at him

JEDBURGH (CONT’D)
What do you do for fun Craven

CRAVEN
What’s your interest in my
daughters death

JEDBURGH slides a file across the table CRAVEN opens it to
reveal photographs of DROWNED BODIES Two men and one woman
Under the age of thirty

JEDBURGH
Recognize them

CRAVEN
Should I

JEDBURGH shows a further image A NIGHTFLOWER TATOO

JEDBURGH
They were friends of your daughter
Two journalists and a videographer
They broke into a US Classified
nuclear research facility Theres
a theory out there Craven that they
had your daughters help

JEDBURGH (CONTD)

nothing from Craven)
They landed a boat at Northmoor
where your daughter worked broke
into the facility And then they
drowned in the Connecticut River
while making their escape Before
you ask it was an accident I
looked into it Just because people
were committing treason doesnt
mean they can handle a canoe or
swim too good in thirty degree
water Agnosco peregrinus

JEDBURGH lifts the cake plate revealing the gun and badge

JEDBURGH (CONT’D)
Whered you get that throwdown you
pulled on me outside

CRAVEN
My daughter was carrying it

JEDBURGH
Police know that They know that
you know that her apartment was
tossed Her computer stolen That
she was the real target

No
JEDBURGH
You are a smart fucker

Dont look for the web site its
been taken down

A few marches and the waving of
placards is all within reasonbut
these people are serious They make
raids into secure facilities and
post videos on the internet
Usually they depend on inside help
Say an intern at a facility With
sympathetic politics

CRAVEN
My daughter was not a joiner She
was like me

JEDBURGH
Thats not what it looks like
Craven You see I saw the autopsy
report The tattoo

For some reason that makes CRAVEN want to kill him

CRAVEN
Listen to me She was not anti-nuke
protester She was a nuclear
scientist She called vegetarians
dirtwizards She said that beer
in a brewpub was made with a
hippys sock She ate veal and that
other shit that

JEDBURGH
Its probably called foie gras
Craven I see what youre
struggling after

CRAVEN
She was not the type

JEDBURGH
We dont yet know what type was
required What could be bad enough
to make her join forces with
enviromentalist dirtwizards who she
would ordinarily despise is what
we maybe should be asking
Politics Money

CRAVEN is stumped

JEDBURGH (CONT’D)
Her friends died She came home
She came to you

CRAVEN
She didn’t tell me anything I
think she meant to but she didnt
make it
(a beat)
You dont know who killed her

JEDBURGH
No And I have advised my
department of one which would be
me that the best way to find out
is to let you keep at it

CRAVEN
With you concealing what I find

JEDBURGH
Fuck I have a magic wand I wave
it over anything and it turns
Classified But I think you dont
need any help concealing anything

CRAVEN
Im not going to arrest anybody
Jedburgh You know that

JEDBURGH
I know that

CRAVEN
Im going back out west Tomorrow

JEDBURGH
Ill be at the Ritz on Avery
Street Under the name of Diogenes
Hes the one who went around with

Burnham shambles along the street past Joes Cafe He follows
him at a distance
INT PACKAGE STORE MARKET AND MAIN AFTERNOON
BURNHAM not in good shape coughing pays for off-brand

cigarettes and an alcoholics holiday a pint of Jim Beam and
a dollhouse of off-brand beer

stopped at the red light BURNHAM moves around the corner
with his beer

CRAVEN sits on in his car
INT BURNHAMS DUPLEX HOUSE LATER

Sounds of key in lock and Burnham comes in He enters the
bumf-crammed hallway (things he might have needed before he
was a drunk like skis plus things hes needed recently
like the knife up in the door casing and the length of pipe
against the jamb) He moves through into his kitchen a
destroyed poststudent shithole and clumps the beer on the
table He hesitates bleakly for a moment Then he turns into

A PISTOL With Craven behind it CRAVEN grabs BURNHAM by the
throat and holds him against the refrigerator

CRAVEN
Same deal as before Quick call I
came to chat Saw an illegal
firearm You want to talk now

BURNHAM
Theres nothing you can do to me

CRAVEN begging to differ lightly pops Burnhams head with
the pistol barrel and breaks the skin Blood runs into
Burnhams eye

CRAVEN

BURNHAM
There are times you dont have a
fucking choice what kind of guy you

He shoves away from Craven and rips the cardboard open and
gets a beer pops it open virtually drains it

BURNHAM (CONTD)

BURNHAM
Anyway this politician couldnt

suck water into the place and flood
it in case of a fire Thats how
they got in I told her how to put

your prints were though

CRAVEN
I visited him

NORTHAMPTON POLICE DETECTIVE
You handled his firearm

CRAVEN
He had a Springfield Armory micro-
compact in his kitchen On the
counter I advised him that it
should be safely stored with a
trigger lock in place to comply
with Mass Law

The NORTHAMPTON DETECTIVE looks at his partner

NORTHAMPTON POLICE DETECTIVE
You were in Boston last night

CRAVEN
I already told you that

NORTHAMPTON POLICE DETECTIVE
Well the time of death isnt
arguable He woke up the
neighborhood

Turns a page on his notepad

NORTHAMPTON POLICE DETECTIVE (CONTD)
What was your impression of his
state of mind

CRAVEN
He was despondent over my
daughters death He was drinking
heavily He was confused But not
to the point where I would have
ever thought to PC him He put away
the firearm when requested to do
so

NORTHAMPTON POLICE DETECTIVE
You know he was unpermitted for a
handgun in Mass

CRAVEN
I did not know that I was visiting
him in civilian capacity outside
my jurisdiction and I took his
representations about the firearm
at face value

NORTHAMPTON POLICE DETECTIVE
OK well Im done You got one
lucky thing admiral

CRAVEN
Whats that

NORTHAMPTON POLICE DETECTIVE
Were not putting it out there that
he was your daughters boyfriend

CRAVEN
Why not

NORTHAMPTON POLICE DETECTIVE
I thought you asked

CRAVEN looks at him

CRAVEN
I didnt But maybe it was someone
with my familys interest at heart

NORTHAMPTON POLICE DETECTIVE
Like the Lieutenant Governor

CRAVEN
Were you also told to not mention
Northmoor

A stare

NORTHAMPTON POLICE DETECTIVE
No one tells a police officer
anything But as you know it can
be strongly suggested

(a beat)
You remember when the Statie who
busted Whitey Bulger got
transferred to the airport

CRAVEN nods

down beside him On sound Neil Diamonds A Solitary Man is
playing

JEDBURGH
Your theme song Craven This your
intro

CRAVEN

I prefer the Johnny Cash version

Jedburgh
You would because its as
depressing as fuck

CRAVEN
Happiness is not an emotion Im
overly familiar with But whenever
I did feel it Emma was usually the

cause
JEDBURGH
You loved her very much didn’t
you
Craven is silent
CRAVEN

Nightflower My daughter
evidently helped them get into the
Northmoor facility I have had a
source that says that they were
intentionally exposed to radiation
while in the tunnels

JEDBURGH
You got him on record

CRAVEN
You are kidding right

JEDBURGH
You know Craven you have to
wonder how many cases go down the
toilet are never solved simply
because theyre too fucking
complicated Too much work Theres
a lot out there in this world that
youll just never connect A to B
In my own profession sometimes
that has not mattered Facts In
yoursyou cant leave home
without em And sometimes its like
trying to get warm jello to take a
shape You threatened Bennett

CRAVEN
How do you know

JEDBURGH
Because I was told to kill you

CRAVEN
You gonna kill me

JEDBURGH
Well see-what Im trying to tell
you about my profession is that I
wasnt told in so many words to
kill you You see deniability is
such a god to people because its
all you need Like Love in the old
days In a world where you have to
be guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt plausible deniability is
your best friend And its very
easy Craven Very easy You cant
connect me to the government Im
just another swinging dick in the
universe But everybody being so
shit scared about being connected
to what I do means I can use my
judgement

CRAVEN
Could someone have used their own
judgement to kill Emma

JEDBURGH
No I think whoever did that is who
I want to kill Expose Or mutilate
unto the death by media Theyre
not really playing for Team USA

Scott Fitzgerald thing about an
artist being a man who could hold
two opposing ideas in his head and
believe in them both
simultaneously

CRAVEN
Heard of it

JEDBURGH
Thats what I have to be

CRAVEN
Why dont you just be what its
right to be

JEDBURGH looks at the bar

JEDBURGH
Ill take it under advisement

JEDBURGH
I didnt do it But if I had1

burglarized that mans apartment

CRAVEN
Youre really nervous Mister
Sanderson

SANDERSON

CRAVEN
Youre about two seconds from
telling me that this is
inappropriate so let me say right
off that I know you couldnt help
her with her NDA but you suggested
that you could give it some further
discussion and then you had
dinner

This is all accurate SANDERSON is in a state

CRAVEN (CONT’D)
Now I think you had two agendas
One you wanted to have sex with
her Hey Im not passing
judgement The second thing on your
agenda is that you wanted to know
more about what sort of potential
breach she represented to
Northmoor

SANDERSON
I have to get to a deposition in
Springfield

CRAVEN
-Which you also represent

SANDERSON stares at him

SANDERSON
This is

CRAVEN
Let me add that you also organize
Western Mass for Tim Pine who has
put your name up before two
different governors for district

something

from your jurisdiction

blow the whistle on Northmoor and
that you work for Northmoor and did
not disclose it to her And youll

SANDERSON
On what evidence would you say
this

CRAVEN

-»Ill forge a fucking diary I
dont care Getting you in

Listen asshole This is not about

not about police and arrest and
all that This is about me knowing

EXT A COUNTRY AIRPORT TWILIGHT

A G4 is landed and BENNETT is waiting for whoever gets out of
it Whoever turns out to be

MOORE Call him a younger Jedburgh Without the charm class
or savoir vivre or conscience But no one is a perfect
villain he probably has kids He donates to his alumni
charities He comes forward and shakes hands with BENNETT

MOORE
You mind if I get philosophical

BENNETT
By all means

MOORE
Were calling this a containment
situation But really the problem
is that there are things
uncontained and some of them will
never go back in the box

BENNETT realizes this

MOORE (CONTD)
Youre worried about Cravenand
wisely But apart from Craven
three sets of parents have lost
their kids The dead have friends
lovers relatives One missing
person leaves a billion loose ends
Estimated Nightflower was
hubristic You dont think they

announced their intentions
(MORE )

94

MOORE (CONTD)
And as for the deaths They are
paranoid anti-corporate freaks You
think that three of their people
drowning is going to read as an
accident

BENNETT
It was an accident

Another man gets out of the plane MILLROY Something is up
with MILLROY being here Something not good MILLROY stands
and waits for his luggage

MOORE
Their bodies were recovered by a
radiation team and disposed of One
of them was the only child of a Mum
with multiple sclerosiswhen
shes on TV saying the last I knew
they were breaking into
Northmoordo you know what Im
saying to you Bennett Do you
understand what you have done

BENNETT
Whats worse Me doing it if in
fact anything has been done or you
covering it up Im just a private
individual What are you

MOORE shuts up

BENNETT (CONTD)

(serenely)
Whatever they say there was no
break-in Northmoor has never had a
security breach Northmoor has
never had an accident and
Northmoor does not make weapons
much less dirty bombs with jihadist
fingerprints on them and fuck you
its classified still works as far
as I know

(less serenely)
Im not an idiot Our best scenario
may well be to enhance our position
of deniability

MOORE
Im a student of appearances Im
an analyst of appearances
(MORE)

MOORE (CONTD)
And if youre not completely fucked
I am not worth a penny Ive ever
been paid We have an advantage
Nightflower is a pack of nuts We
can spin that But the cop is a
different matter

BENNETT
There are difficulties with his
being a cop

MOORE
Hes like anybody else He has to
be presented with a credible
scenario and he has to buy
itPerhaps pay him off

BENNETT
Youre coming to this late Ive
met him

MOORE realizes that he may not be exactly where he should be
on the learning curve but

MOORE
Why does no one know that Emma
Craven was contaminated

BENNETT
She was cremated Checking for
radiation is not common in an
autopsy

MOORE
How was she exposed

BENNETT says nothing MOORE looks at him

BENNETT
Perhaps a protocol was expanded in
scope

MOORE
I get it

BENNETT

Hes unhinged by grief Thats a
color in your paintbox

MOORE
Ill decide what colors are in my
paintbox Are you even here Mister
Bennett Are we even talking

He gets the car in gear and he drives watching for a tail
We stay in the car as he turns onto Pearl Street and then in
front of The Tunnel a head-scarfed young woman in a long coat
steps out of the recess beneath the train station and he
reaches over and unlocks the door

MELISSA gets in

He stops the car MELISSA has lunged and hugged him He holds
her tears leaking

MELISSA
Im so sorry

CRAVEN

MELISSA stares at him Maybe a plain girl Eyes red of
course

MELISSA
I introduced her to them

CRAVEN
Introduced her to who honey

MELISSA
Nightflower Fuck you know Fuck
Corporations this corporations
that Those people How the fuck
was I supposed to know

CRAVEN
That theyd run into what they only
fantasized about

MELISSA
Yeah They were just crusading
jerkoffs It was evil corporation
this and evil corporation that but
they never expected
(suddenly together)
You know what Emma said

Cravens look no what did Emma say
CRAVENS POV

EMMA in a winter coat a scarf is walking down Pearl
Street looking in the windows of shops Hip happy girl out
for a walk in her town

MELISSA (CONTD)
She said what it was all about was
where academia blended into
corporate and corporate blended
into the government and it was a
world which didnt really know what
it was any moreand it did just
not give a fuckit just did
notgive a fuckShe said you
give some academic dork a corporate
job and a jet hes bad enough but
if you give him a security
apparatus and hes worse than
anything that ever crawled on the
earth Bennetts the motherfucker
Its Bennett Thats all she wanted
to say first That he was insane
She realized he was completely
fucking insane

CRAVEN
OK listen whether the guy is this
that or whatever what do they do
at Northmoor Why did Emma go to
Nightflower

MELISSA
Because she couldnt go to the
papers because of her contract and
the senator wouldnt help and you
are NOT hearing this from me I run
a luggage store I have a three
year old

CRAVEN
I am not hearing it from you What
did Northmoor do that Emma wanted
to expose

MELISSA
They came to my house these guys
in black suits asking about Emma
and I lied my ass off

CRAVEN
Honey concentrate What did
Northmoor do that Emma wanted to
expose Tell me Ill let you out
of here you can go back to your
baby I never saw you at all

MELISSA
I have to tell you something else
first

CRAVEN
What is it

MELISSA

They poisoned her They poisoned
her with cesium She said she was
going to die but she had to go see
you

(a beat)
She said it was in the milk in her
fridge

CRAVEN takes this on board

CRAVEN
You know I like this town you
know when she moved out here she
said it was like moving to Paris in
the Twentiesbecauseyou
know-we have a very traditional
homeMaybe not what she wanted
out of life

He loses it
INSIDE THE FRIDGE

The door opens and the light comes up on the GLASS MILK
CONTAINTER And CRAVEN is partially revealed as he

Lays the DOSIMETER close to the MILK CONTAINER The glass
part gives a weak signal

But when he moves the dosimeter up to the paper cap (that
reads SAFE AS MILK) the reading oes through the roof

We do not see Cravens face

He closes the door and we go to
BLACK

INT SUBURBAN NIGHT

BENNETT is riding with MILLROY and MOORE Silently Other
cars behind them

MOORE
OK I dont need to know every
detail of this fuckup

BENNETT takes it

MOORE (CONTD)
But I need to know something about
the properties of the substance you
gave Emma Craven

MOORE (CONTD)
I would rather not discuss it in
those terms

MOORE fumes

MOORE (CONTD)
Is it something she could have
encountered in her work

BENNETT
Any exposure if there were an
exposure would be consistent with
a documentable procedural failure
on her part

MOORE
Is it something that could have
remained in her effects and been
transferred to her father without
much collateral contamination

BENNETT
Yes it is

MILLROY sits light washing over him

MOORE
Wed be further along in this if
Jedburgh hadnt disappeared Any
news of him

MILLROY looks up from his BLACKBERRY

MILLROY
None

MOORE
If Northmoor were a Defense RandD
operation whats the situation in
the opinion of you not of your
department if Craven opens his
mouth

MILLROY
Its unsurviveable

JEDBURGH
Do you see a soul in there

DOCTOR
I beg your pardon

No answer from Jedburgh

DOCTOR (CONTD)
You can put your shirt on

JEDBURG

(buttoning his shirt)
As a class Ive found that doctors
have no sense of humor Plus they
think that a narrow technical
education in a service profession
is a mark of intellectual
superiority You get it in a form
from dentists as well which Ive
always found truly puzzling

DOCTOR
As we discussed yesterday there
will be some erratic behavior
erratic ideation Ideation

se Fe HO

JEDBURG
I know what ideation means

DOCTOR looks at him Jedburgh looks out the window at the
Boston skyline

JEDBURG (CONTD)
I have to say that if youre going
to get sick Bostons not a bad
place to do it

Looks at doctor

JEDBURG (CONTD)
Ive had some aural hallucinations
My fathers voice calling my name
just as I start to sleep I come
awake Im not sleeping Evey time
I start to sleep I jolt awake
Theres something about the
darknessthat I dont like

DOCTOR
Im not a counselor

JEDBURGH grins at him finishing buttoning his shirt

DOCTOR (CONTD)
I know you want to banter with me
I dont do that I can only give
you the facts

JEDBURGH

Everybody knows the facts We live
we die in most cases horribly and
much sooner than we would wish And
when we do we think about what
weve done and what we didnt do
Doctors too I admire what you do
I know if I were operable youd be
in there like a kid after ice
cream The way you do it could use
some work

INT SENATOR PINES KITCHEN DAY

TIM PINE in a fairly goofy dressing gown is failing to make
a tuna fish sandwich CRAVEN stands looking at him coat
still on TIM PINE licks mayo off his thumb

TIM PINE
Its always a pleasure to meet

another combat veteran
(MORE )

TIM PINE (CONTD)
You left as a Master Sergeant of a
heavy weapons platoon

CRAVEN
Yes sir I did

TIM PINE
Howd you do that at twenty

CRAVEN
Everybody else was dead

TIM PINE
Did you have trouble adjusting when
you came home

CRAVEN
No

TIM PINE
Really

CRAVEN

I know a lot of people say things
about trauma and so forth but
pretty much you come out of combat
the way you come in I know thats
not a very kind thing to say but
its my own observation

Senator Pine has a facial tic Ignoring this

TIM PINE
What is the nature of our
appointment Detective Craven

CRAVEN
Im gonna ask you to tell me that

TIM PINE
Please sit

CRAVEN does

TIM PINE (CONTD)
How am I supposed to tell you what
you want to see me about

CRAVEN
Youre seeing me less than forty
eight hours after I spoke to your
attorney

TIM PINE
Your daughter did come to me with
allegations about Northmoor She
sent me a letter

CRAVEN
What did that letter contain

TIM PINE
It touched on National Security
matters that are classified

CRAVEN
What happened to that letter

TIM PINE
Thats also classified But
protocol would be to turn it over
to the committee which does
oversight on the area your
daughters letter touched upon

CRAVEN
Prompting an investigation of my
daughter And myself

TIM PINE
Im not involved in security
aspects I did write to your
daughter advising her that she
might be in breach of security

CRAVEN
So you didnt help her

TIM PINE
I am very glad to see you
Detective as both a veteran and as
a police officer of your many years
of service but I have to tell you
that your daughter and we have to
say this despite her terrible
accident was in violation
ofalmost everything of which she
could be in violation

CRAVEN
What did she allege

TIM PINE
Thats classified You know
Detective a very important part of
the Massachusetts economy is
research and development whether
its biotechnology or military
technology We have unusual
capability people like your
daughter coming out of MIT and so
forth you might say were the
brain of the United States

CRAVEN
Senator

THe Senator has mayonaise on his face

TIM PINE
Yes

CRAVEN
If you cant help me I have things
to do

TIM PINE

Things like what

CRAVEN
I think youre in a position
Senator as regards Northmoor
where you had better decide whether
youre hanging on the crucifix or
banging the nails

TIM PINE blinking Facial tics

CRAVEN lays out photographs of the drowned nightflower people
and a horrible in situ photograph the first one we have
seen of the murdered Emma

TIM PINE
Why do you include your daughter

CRAVEN
These deaths are the result of a
conspiracy by one of your major
campaign contributors

TIM PINE
Why do you include your daughter

CRAVEN
Because Bennett poisoned her with
cesium Possibly partially as a
result of your handing her letter
to your oversight committee But
the radiation poisoning wasnt
happening fast enough She made it
home And she was shot on my front
porch With both barrels of a
shotgun

TIM PINE
By someone after you

CRAVEN shakes his head no

CRAVEN

It may not connect I know the sort
of people Im after But I can make
it connect as much as I need to I
think Im scaring you Senator and
theres probably no real upside to
scaring a Senator so Im gonna go
and Im gonna leave you these
pictures And I want you to get on
the phone and tell everybody
concerned that I know what I have
to know to throw a real box of
tarantulas into your situation

(as the SENATOR starts to

INT THE LAKE HOUSE NIGHT

THE SENATOR MILLROY MOOREand thats who we see for now

gathered around the polished dining room table under the
rafters This is a war conference A spin conference

MOORE
Weve got a cop of almost thirty
years spotless service and theres
not one person not on our side who
could account for his instability
without lying who has executed the
director of a nuclear research
facility at which his daughter was
employed OK Ideas

JEDBURGH
Your scenario is this He was
poisoned accidentally by his own
daughter But he blamed Bennett

MOORE
How do we know that

JEDBURGH
-Testimony of an altercation at
Northmoor when he was there
Testimony from the Senator

SENATOR
I can easily testify that I found
him unstablehe came to my
house

JEDBURGH
Thats right He made wild
allegations And youre lucky to be
alive

SENATOR
True My people can draft a
statement

JEDBURGH
Now the real story is Senator
Escapes Assassination

MOORE is glad that Jedburgh is here

MOORE
Thats right Thats the lead
story It will wipe the rest of it
right out of the newspapers

JEDBURGH
Anyone looking into the rest of
this is going to know that
something happened but no one is
going to be able to figure it out
MORE)

JEDBURGH (CONTD)
Thats your objective That its so
convoluted that everyone can have
theories and no one has a fact that
isnt contradicted by another

SENATOR
Thats quite good Jedburgh

JEDBURGH
Senator Ive been making things
unintelligible for thirty years
(a beat)
And by the way its Colonel
Jedburgh To you
(a beat as PINE flinches)
Whats the prognosis on Craven

MILLROY
Hes terminal

JEDBURGH sits

JEDBURGH
So let me suggest that youve
been blowing smoke up my ass as
well You werent really attempting
to treat him at the Northmoor
facility You just didnt want it
known that he was exposed to
radiation Because it was a link

MOORE looks at MILLROY who looks at MOORE

JEDBURGH (CONT’D)
You would have let him die chained
to the bed and then disposed of the
body

MILLROY
A plan almost worthy of you I
should think

JEDBURGH not liking what this says about him lays out his
pills One two three He takes out his FLASK Then he doesnt
take the pills He puts them away into the bottle One two
three MILLROY looks significantly at Moore

SENATOR
I understand you had a chance to
terminate Detective Craven and did
not do so

JEDBURGH looks at him

JEDBURGH

Well Thats a difficult issue

(a beat)
Let me explain something to you
gentlemen I dont get orders I
get suggestions I dont exist
Its up to me who I take into the
dark As I once said to Craven
We were drinking He wasnt much
fun you see something had
happened to his daughter

(a beat)
Now Im a Romantic man

MOORE
Jedburgh weve got to get the
senator out to the press

JEDBURGH
»and I would like to think that
what I have spent my life on is the
fight between good and evil

MILLROY
Are you feeling quite well

SENATOR
We wouldnt be in this situation I
think we all agree if Craven had
been neutralized

JEDBURGH
I dont think youre aware of the
side of the situation youre on

He stands up and before we even see that he has a gun he
shoots MILLROY and MOORE both directly in the forehead

SENATOR
Im a United States Senator

JEDBURGH
By what standard

JEDBURG FIRES The door bangs open the YOUNG TROOPER who was
nice to Craven stands there with gun drawn-but Jedburgh has
the drop on him

JEDBURGH (CONTD)
You got family son

The TROOPER nods JEDBURGH holds his gun aside like a
gentleman refusing fire in a duel and the TROOPER fires

INT CAR MOMENTS LATER

CRAVEN gets into the car He looks across to the passenger
seat Emma is there She is the age she was at the time of
her death for the first time in these hallucinations She

This is encouraging I can see Emma but still it is death
