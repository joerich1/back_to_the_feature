There’s nothing nice about a

better when two people can come to
anagreement without a judge
telling you how you are going to
live your life Because a judge
doesn’t care about you after he or

don’t care It’s always better if
youcan craft or make your own
deal That being said I just want
to remind all parties present that

still time to revise the specifics
of this agreement but after these
divorce documents are signed of
course that window closes Ok Mr

made many friends Before he fell

that I was dedicating my run for
