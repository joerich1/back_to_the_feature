INT CARGO PLANE MILITARY AIRBASE ISRAEL - DAY

A strange ROARING sound

CLOSE ON A YOUNG WOMAN

in darkness Light begins to spill on her from the right
- revealing her face lost in thought This is RACHEL
SINGER - pretty painfully young looking A surgical
dressing covers half her face

As we pull back a little we see that two YOUNG MEN sit
either side of her They are STEPHAN GOLD (thirties) thick-
set capable and DAVID PERETZ (late twenties) dark-haired
and pale-faced

The three faces in the darkness each looking straight
ahead - something from a Caravaggio painting

The roaring which we realise is the sound of ENGINES
gradually runs down into silence

The light from the bay door which is opening off-screen
begins to flood the scene with HARSH DAYLIGHT revealing
the inside of a CARGO PLANE

Stephan turns to look at the growing light Then he turns
to Rachel

STEPHAN
Breathe

He stands Rachel turns to look at David but he is standing
too his face a mask

Rachel gathers herself then stands and turns to follow the
other two walking towards the light

As the three approach the opening and descend the ramp of
the bay door we hear a womans voice
SARAH (VO)
We should never forget how young
they were

Silhouetted against the bright light is a group of waiting
MILITARY and MOSSAD DIGNITARIES Their hands are raised in
applause

Despite their youth theyd had
the courage to confront an
unimaginable evil

The three walk towards their welcoming party Rachel blinks

against the sunlight takes out a pair of sunglasses and
slips them on

CLOSE ON YOUNG RACHEL

as she waits behind David and Stephan face bleached out
by the sunlight She stares at the ground

SARAH (VO)
But this was not what was
celebrated It was their youth
itself that became a symbol Here
were the children who had faced

Israels greatest nightmare her

greatest pain
David and Stephan have moved out of shot and Rachel reaches
the DIGNITARIES Still looking down she manages a smile a
bob of her head reaches out to shake the first hand

People around Rachel begin to applaud the sound almost
startling her Automatically she gives the same bob of the
head acknowledging the applause

Sarah cheeks burning with a mixture of embarrassment and
emotion hasnt finished yet She locks eyes with her
mother

SARAH (CONTD)
Mother Im so very proud to be
your daughter

More applause Rachel manages to smile

INT FUNCTION ROOM HOTEL NEAR TEL AVIV - LATER
The room is now alive with the excited chatter of the
guests

Rachel moves against the tide of the audience with a fixed
social smile murmuring thanks to well-wishers trying to
get out trying not to look like shes trying to get out
EXT TEL AVIV HOTEL NEAR TEL AVIV PATIO - CONTINUOUS

She emerges onto the empty patio slides the glass door
shut behind her muffling the chatter from the room beyond
She lights a cigarette inhales greedily trying to calm
down She stares at the sun blazing over the Mediterranean
ahead of her Her glasses darken against the reflected
glare

As if sensing something she turns to see a SMALL BOY - her
GRANDSON - watching her from behind the glass of the patio
door something UNNERVING in his direct gaze

Rachel stares back at him in silence

Sarah appears behind the boy her son and scoops him up
into a hug Still the boy stares at his grandmother who
gives a tight smile and turns back to the sea

Another guest walks up to Sarah and she nods smiling at
what he is saying to her but her eyes slide back to her
mother standing on the other side of the glass

1NTEXT APARTMENT BLOCK TEL AVIV SUBURB - DAY

A shabby dimly-lit stairwell in a run-down section of the
city

A YOUNG MOSSAD AGENT knocks at one of the apartment doors
After a moment it is answered by OLDER DAVID now 62

YOUNG AGENT
David Peretz

DAVID
Yes

YOUNG AGENT
You were expecting me

David looks at this young version of himself

DAVID

Yes I was expecting you
YOUNG AGENT
Would you come with me sir

David stares at him then walks back into the apartment
The door almost swings shut and the Agent catches it

considering walking in after him But before he can David
re-emerges carrying his jacket

DAVID
Lets go

TITLES BEGIN -

We TRACK with David CLOSE on his face as the two men begin
the long walk down the staircase

He doesnt say anything to his companion doesnt look
around him and we HOLD on that face as his mind tries to
catch up tries to work something out to decide

EXT STREET - CONTINUOUS

The apartment block stands on stilts Abandoned furniture
is piled around the columns supporting the building

Still on David as the two men walk out from the darkness
into the street that services the run-down estate David
follows as the agent moves ahead towards a larger road
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 260309 6

They cross a busy carriageway and wait for a moment on the
central reservation for a break in the traffic

Parked on the far side of the road two identical cars
their windows tinted

The Agent moves to the leading car opens the drivers door
and gets in David stops in the road opens the rear
passenger door and throws his jacket inside

He pauses for a moment and turns to look back at the second
car

INT CAR - CONTINUOUS

A MAN sits in the back of the car silhouetted against the
brightness outside This is OLDER Stephan now 63

He watches as David straightens up hands on hips
squinting up at the sun

11 EXT STREET TEL AVIV SUBURB - CONTINUOUS 11

DAVID
(Indistinctly)
Sorry

The Agent turns

YOUNG AGENT
What sir

DAVID
(Beat)
I - I think I

He stands like that for a moment and then suddenly STEPS
OUT INTO THE ROAD in front of an on-coming TRUCK The
impact sweeps him out of the frame

The shocked Agent scrambles out of the vehicle as other
cars screech to a halt in front of Davids lifeless body

her

Well Ill be back We

MIRIAM a PUBLISHER appears at her shoulder with a copy of
Sarahs book

MIRIAM
Ive marked the place I thought
perhaps from chapter eleven

RACHEL
Yes thank you

Rachel nods absently flicking through the pages of the
book Sarah realizes with a small stab of pain that she
has no idea what that means

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 260309 8

SARAH
If youd rather read something
else mother

RACHEL
No thats fine

Rachel is barely listening She is staring at a black and
white photograph in the book

We see that the photograph is of a YOUNG MAN in NAZI
UNIFORM Its titled DIETER VOGEL The Surgeon of
Birkenau
MIRIAM
You must be very proud

Rachel looks up at her realizes what Miriam is talking
about
RACHEL
(A little automatic)
Its a wonderful achievement
Im very proud of her

MIRIAM
And Im sure you were invaluable
in the research

SARAH
(Keeping it light)
Actually my mother withstood all
interrogation My father was the
talker (Trying a joke) Im the
only journalist in Israel she
wont speak to

Miriam laughs obligingly but Sarah instantly regrets the
remark

There is a sudden excited MURMUR from the table The women
look over to where Stephan approaches the table He is ina
motorised WHEELCHAIR The Mossad Agent attends discreetly
in the background

Rachels face hardens

RACHEL
I thought he couldnt come

SARAH
(Standing up surprised)
So did I

Several of the local POLITICOS have stood up to greet
Stephan who is all smiles and handshakes
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 260309 9

Theres good-natured laughter from the table Sarah joins
her father kissing his cheek

SARAH

STEPHAN

Rachel watches as he takes a place at the table picks up a
copy of the book and examines the cover photograph holding
his glasses a little from his eyes to focus

SARAHS HUSBAND

STEPHAN
Thats good Good good Thats

Rachel takes a sip of water and notices Stephens hands
crumbling some bread - theyre SHAKING

She looks up at his face reads the hidden STRAIN there

He senses her gaze and meets it and for a second his smile
falters and SOMETHING LIKE PANIC flickers in his eyes

Rachel stares back at him disturbed Miriam stands
tapping her glass with her fork
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 260309

MIRIAM
I just want thank you all for
coming to help us celebrate the
launch of this wonderful book
Im sure were all particularly
thrilled to have two of the
heroes of this story at the
table And even more thrilled
that one of them has agreed to
read for us

Applause She gestures to Rachel who stands still looking
at Stephan The table quietens down Rachel opens the book
at the marked place and hesitates only now realising what
she is about to read Then

RACHEL

(reading)
On the evening of the 31st of
December it began to rain more
heavily So isolated had they
become from the outside world
that it was only when she looked
out of the window that Rachel
remembered it was New Years
Eve

INT KITCHEN BERLIN SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT - THE PAST

Young Rachel stands in the small kitchen Rain lashes on
the window She stares out at some FIREWORKS exploding
nearby then turns away and begins to gather three METAL
SAUCEPANS from the shelves

We TRACK with her as she walks into the
LIVING ROOM

And begins to place the pots on the floor to catch the
rainwater which is dripping through various points in the
ceiling

As she positions the last pot we REVOLVE around her to get
our first view of the far wall And there tied to a
radiator is DIETER VOGEL now 50 Hes bound his mouth
taped apparently asleep

Rachel doesnt of course react to this sight Instead
she begins to clear away some pieces of BROKEN GLASS BOWL
from the floor We TRACK with her as she walks back down
the short hallway into the kitchen drops the pieces of

bowl into the bin From the living room comes the three
distinct PINGS of rainwater dripping in the pots
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 260309 11

She stops suddenly puzzled Its a moment before she works
out what shes noticed - something has changed in the sound
of the rainwater next door

There are only two drips instead of three
She walks back towards the living room

RACHELS POV - through the living room door we can see
that one of the pots has been overturned Rachel slows to a
stop A sudden wave of adrenalin causes her to turn
butits too late Vogel steps out of the alcove hes
been standing in so that he is directly in front of her
Before she can even cry out he has slashed her face open
with a SHARD OF GLASS

Instinctively she cups her hands to her ripped face Vogel
grabs her by the hair and stepping behind her tries to
worm his other hand underneath her raised arms to reach her
throat with the glass

Her training kicking in Rachel uses a krav magah move to
grab and twist Vogels forearm breaking his hold on her
and turning the arm until with a yell of pain Vogel drops
the shard He swings wildly at her but Rachel ducks the
fist and drives the palm of her hand up into his face

Vogel stumbles back surprised by her speed and the sudden
pain of the blow

Rachel is about to press home the attack but is blinded by
blood from her wound washing into her eyes

As she wipes her eyes clear Vogel grabs a LAMP from a
small chest of drawers in the hall and smashes it into her
face She falls

Vogel begins to run but driven by adrenaline and
desperation Rachel scrambles onto all fours and lunges at
him catching hold of his trouser leg as he moves towards
the front door

Vogel stumbles manages to pull a leg free and stamps down
on Rachel who lets go with a moan He stamps again steps
free and kicks her hard in the head

Rachel rolls with the force of the kick and comes to a
rest losing consciousness
RACHELS POV - LOW ANGLE - Fluttering in and out of
darkness - Vogels feet as he stands beside us breathing
hard Then he turns and hurries to the front doorand
out

Vogel hurries along the walkway and sets off DOWN THE
SPIRAL STAIRCASE of the apartment building

Rachel lies motionless Then a cough And another And
finally she rolls over holding her gaping cheek with one
hand and drags herself towards the CHEST OF DRAWERS

With difficulty Rachel pulls out a GUN fitted with a
silencer and pulls herself towards the door

stairs

20 EXT WALKWAY - NIGHT
Streaming blood from her face Rachel heaves herself out of
the apartment towards the railings guarding the walkway We
hear the clatter of Vogels feet on the stairs below She
raises the gun to the railings to take aim

21 EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT
Bursting from the stairwell Vogel starts to run across the

courtyard towards the street

22 EXT WALKWAYCOURTYARD - NIGHT

Rachels aim follows Vogels lunge for the gateway

RACHELS POV

There is a lurid flash of fireworks from nearby and for a
moment we see Vogel lit about to make it to the gate and
disappear forever
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 260309 13

Rachel FIRES A single shot And improbably incredibly
the tiny figure of Vogel drops

Rachel hangs over the banisters far above us gun in hand
staring at us with disbelief

EXT TERRACE HOTEL NEAR TEL AVIV - NIGHT
Rachel finishes reading and puts the book down

Nobody moves The air of bonhomie has been replaced by an
uneasy silence Not knowing what else to do one of the
guests begins to clap and the others hurriedly join in
Rachel doesnt acknowledge the applause

Stephan is staring at her with a STRANGE INTENSITY

INTEXT STEPHENS CAR TEL AVIV - NIGHT

Stephan and Rachel sit in the back of the car Behind a
screen the young Mossad Agent we saw earlier sits in the
front next to the Driver Tel Aviv races by in neon smears

The air is charged with tension

(Of the driver)
Hes driving too fast

Stephan ignores her She turns to the window watches as
they streak past another car

RACHEL
He didnt tell me anything (Off

to go

Stephan is still staring at her reading her

Something terrible has happened

in thought

little islands of occupation the places where David sat

As the door behind him opens he stands aside and watches

Rachel is packing folding clothes neatly precisely
silently - all the time a terrible tension in her
movements

She tries to close a drawer but it sticks She keeps
trying then in a sudden rush of fury yanks the drawer free
and hurls it across the room

She stands breathing hard

Stephan takes out an ENVELOPE and passes it to her

She opens it and examines the contents - an AIR-PLANE

Rachel walk in and stand framed in the doorway looking
every inch the young married couple Stephan looks at them
for a beat then starts to play the first few bars of
Mendelssohns wedding march

The other two blush furiously not amused Rachel takes her

very aware of this new female presence in the house theyve

been sharing together for the last month

STEPHAN
What do you think of your new

Stephan to examine

of Rachel wrapped in a towel as she slips past the door
heading for her room The two men watch her pass Stephan
turns and catches Davids expression

knife and repeats the attack move on her She disarms him
easily

Rachel and David are walking to Vogels surgery holding

she steps out of them

We TRACK with her as she walks out from behind the screen
into the large brightly lit room She walks towards the
GYNAECOLOGICAL CHAIR at the centre of the room On the far
wall behind a screen someone stands washing their hands
at a basin

As she walks Rachel passes a tray of MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS
her glance lingering on it

She reaches the chair and climbs onto it A pause and then
tentatively she lifts her feet into the stirrups tugging

the gown to cover herself as best she can

She tries to steady her breathing focussing on the
ceiling A bright LIGHT shines down on her

We hear footsteps approach

Rachel closes her eyes
VOGEL
Good morning Frau Roget Im
Doctor Bernhardt

Rachel opens her eyes Vogel is sitting on a small stool
taking a speculum from the tray of instruments his back to
us

RACHEL
Good morning doctor

He turns and smiles at us - and he has a wonderful warm
smile the air of a gruff but kindly Uncle

VOGEL

She manages to nod

VOGEL (CONTD)
Alright this is my hand and
this is the speculum Its going

Rachel reacts as Vogel pushes the speculum into place
opens it and begins the examination She stares up into the
light

VOGEL (CONTD)

VOGEL
And how long have you and your
husband been trying for a baby
RACHEL
Nearly two years

VOGEL
Uhuh Well the ovaries look
fine Alright lets see your

cervix is slightly retroverted
Tilted backwards

Rachel raises her hand to her LOCKET NECKLACE and begins to
fiddle with it
RACHEL
Really
The angle from which we next see VOGEL and the way the
image of his face freezes in black and white tells us
clearly that this locket conceals a CAMERA DEVICE

VOGEL
Mmm But that generally shouldnt
affect fertility

RACHEL
Oh good

VOGEL

Roget Where are you from

RACHEL

He looks up at her and Rachel instinctively moves her hand
away from the locket She finds herself nodding

Vogel looks away again Rachel bites down on a wave of
panic

An eerie silence

Through the high fence behind the vans we can make out the

On the floor of the van lies Vogels unconscious form

They wait in absolute silence listening to the fading
footsteps of the worker

David checks his watch holds up a single finger to
Stephan Moments later we hear the sound of an approaching
TRAIN

Stephan raises a hand and counts them down - five four
three two one

The two men open the van doors and run at a crouch to the
base of the foot-bridge stanchion as the train roars from
the darkness and begins to pass them screening the two men
from the GUARDS ON THE PLATFORM

Rachel closes the rear door behind them and runs along the
line of the fence to the other end of the yard and crouches
down by a junction box screened from the platform
standing watch

She looks over to Stephen and David in the shadows of the

Rachel holds her breath but nothing disturbs the new
silence

Along the fence she can just make out the two men crouched
in the shadows Stephan raises his hand in an OK
signalling theyre ready

Rachel suddenly hears FOOTSTEPS echoing in the car park

Through the window of a van she can see a POSTAL WORKER
emerging from the depot and crossing the car park

As she watches he takes out a cigarette starts to light it
but then stops He is staring over at the footbridge as if
he can faintly make out those dark shapes at the base

He takes a few steps forward puzzled A little closer and
he might really see something

staring at something

RACHELS P0OV

three POTS have been placed under drips from the ceiling
inside the room We hear the three distinct notes of the
water drops

Rachel stares dully at the water dripping feeling
exhausted and numb

A key scrapes and Rachel turns to the door as Stephan and
David walk in hair soaked from the rain

the living room The camera continues after her

DAVID

shift We never leave him alone

STEPHAN

And youre compromised You dont

The three turn to stare at something off-screen

The camera continues into the room to find Vogels body
slumped on the floor bound to the radiator mouth taped
slumped unconscious

Rachel walks in and finds a flushed David wiping oatmeal
off his trousers the empty bowl on the bench beside him

DAVID
(Off her look)
At this rate hes going to starve
himself to death before we can
get him back

LIVING ROOM - LATER

Rachel sits in the armchair near the end of her shift
watching Vogel who is slumped asleep He looks dishevelled
the oatmeal he refused to eat smeared down his chin She
cant delay the moment anymore

She takes a bowl of prepared oatmeal from the table beside
her and walks towards Vogel stirring the bowl with an
unsteady hand

She kneels down in front of him
In the silence we hear rain falling heavily outside

Vogel wakes stays slumped staring at her with dull eyes
She takes the napkin that was covering the bowl and wipes
the food from his chin Finally she removes the tape from
his mouth Vogel watches her without moving She offers him
a spoon of oatmeal waiting for the sudden yelling and
abuse He says nothing just opens his mouth obediently

Rachel feeds him a spoonful of oatmeal He speaks to Rachel
in German subtitled

VOGEL
My wife

Rachel ignores him feeds him another spoonful

VOGEL (CONTD)

Another spoonful and another

closes his eyes a look of such genuine suffering it stops
Rachel

VOGEL (CONTD)
Please Tell me shes alright

Rachel puts the tape over his mouth and stands David walks
in and takes his place in the ARMCHAIR facing Vogel

Rachel begins to leave She looks back at Vogel who is
staring after her eyes pleading She hesitates then gives
a small nod and turns to walk out of the room passing
Stephan who has been standing in the doorway watching her

encroaching decay of the kitchen at bay scrubbing and

scrubbing

An exhausted David finishing his shift walks out of the

place

Rachel walks out of the bathroom and into her bedroom for
a moment the three criss-crossing each others paths
Rachels bedroom door closes Both men avoid looking at
each other as they pass it

Vogel leans against the wall staring blankly at the
window sunk into a profound depression He looks filthy
jaw dark with beard growth

Rachel watches him from the doorway

LATER
Rachel is washing Vogels face with a towel He pays no
attention continuing to stare out of the window

Rachel picks up a bowl of shaving cream strips the tape
off VOGELs mouth and begins to brush the cream over his
face She produces a RAZOR and carefully begins to shave
his cheeks

She stops suddenly a TEAR is running down Vogels cheek
cutting a line through the soap He turns his eyes to her

VOGEL
Why dont you just kill me now

Rachel pauses for a moment

VOGEL (CONTD)
How can you keep me waiting to
die like this

Rachel keeps on shaving

VOGEL
I know what you want You want to
hand me over to the others let
there be some fucking sham of a
trial Then when they kill me
you can tell yourself that there
was no blood on your hands

Rachel switches to the other cheek Vogels getting more
animated tears in his eyes a kind of bizarre
indignation

VOGEL (CONTD)
But that isnt true There will
be blood on your hands
(MORE)

Rachel tilts his chin up a little and puts the razor to his
throat He falls silent tenses waiting Then

VOGEL (CONTD)
(Softly)
Yes Do it You want to do it

Rachel finishes with a trembling hand

Vogel slumps back against the wall the tension in his body
easing away He gives her a long calculating look

And as we watch some CHANGE seems to come over him some
new fire beginning to kindle in him - a sense of cold
contempt for Rachel and with it perhaps a fresh
determination to survive this

VOGEL (CONTD)
Thats right Id forgotten You
Jews never knew how to kill Only
how to die
Rachel wipes the razor clean on the towel SLAPS fresh tape
onto Vogels mouth and gets up

INT KITCHEN - MORNING

Rachel is cleaning the kitchen again clearing some of the
mess of dishes into the sink
She moves a dirty pan which has been left overnight and

stops staring at the COCKROACH which is crawling inside
A sudden wave of NAUSEA hits her

BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Rachel crouches at the toilet vomiting

She finishes rinses her mouth looks at her pale
reflection

She opens the door and steps out

Vogel stands DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HER

Rachel stands frozen - a split second of total panic
Then Stephan steps into sight behind Vogel gun in hand -

the morning bathroom visit

somewhere nearby and Stephan hurriedly cuts into an alley
waiting in the shadows until the siren has faded away Then
he hurries on his way

Rachel uncovers the dish of prepared oatmeal and kneels
down beside a sleeping Vogel

She removes the tape Vogel wakes breathes out watches
her After a moment
VOGEL

I was dreaming about my wife
She feeds him some more

VOGEL (CONTD)
One of the great regrets of my
life is that we were unable to
have children My wife would have
made a wonderful mother

Vogel watches her then suddenly SPEAKS IN ENGLISH

VOGEL (CONTD)
Its a great blessing
Rachel stares at him

VOGEL (CONTD)

Rachel loads the spoon with more oatmeal determined not to
show any emotion

puts it over his mouth gets up and walks away determined
not to show him any emotion

She looks up at him He stares into her eyes Beat Then
suddenly he kisses her Its what shes waited so long for
and shes stunned for a moment then puts her arms around
his neck returning the kiss hungrily They are helpless
with desire for one another

There is a sudden scratch of a key at the front door and
instinctively the two break apart

Stephan enters hair wet from the rain He stops seeing
them sensing the atmosphere They stare back at him
Rachel steps away a little wiping her face

Vogel is tied in his usual place Stephan sits ina
dangerous mood Hes playing the piano A lyrical rendering
of Deutschland Uber Alles Vogel is watching him

As the music continues the two mens workout grows more
intense - the punches and blocks build in speed faster and

faster both men breathing hard with the exertion neither
willing to stop a real violence simmering under the
surface

Stephan knows hes watched and avoids Vogels gaze until he
can stand it no longer and looks

stopping inches from Stephens face The two men freeze

a halt

Stephan is staring at Vogel He begins to play the anthem
more discordantly hitting the keys more violently as if

the music is possessing him

Then suddenly he stops stands up and walks away from the
keyboard Stares at Vogel

Vogel is very aware of the sudden change in atmosphere a
sense of impending violence

Stephan doesnt move The moment hangs

LATER

David is taking over the shift from Stephan They pass each
other in the doorway without a word

David stops staring

Vogel lies in his usual place A SACK has been placed over
his head hooding him

The effect is deeply sinister

the SACK on the table Stephan glances at it continues

DAVID

Stephan gets up and walks calmly towards David as if
shooing him back out the room

STEPHAN
You dont give orders David Its
your shift now so you can go back
in there

He has his hands on Davids chest gently pushing him back
David takes his hold of the hands pulling them free and
suddenly theres a flurry of violent movement as Stephan
yanks his arms free of David and the two men shove at each
other

RACHEL
Stop it

They stop breathing hard

David looks up from his chair to see in the hallway
Something purposeful in her manner alerts him

Rachel tries to unlock the door but David has hold of it
She struggles against him

He takes her arm Rachel jerks free

RACHEL

Then she slumps against the door her back to them Shes
crying brokenly

A beat as the two men stand over her not attempting to
comfort her any further

Stephan turns and walks away

David leans his head against the door waiting for her to
stop

INT SAFEHOUSE - LIVING ROOM EVENING

Its raining heavily outside and water is dripping through
the cracks in the ceiling

David kneels next to VOGEL with a bowl of oatmeal and
strips the tape from his mouth

VOGEL
Thank you David

David doesnt react
Vogel hums a tune to himself in between spoonfuls watching
David his mood strange

VOGEL (CONTD)
David and Stephan and Rachel

He gives a soft laugh finding something amusing in the
sound of the names

VOGEL (CONTD)
If I had a choice Id prefer
Rachel to feed me So gentlein
another life the makings of a
Nurse I thinkin another
life

David continues to feed careful to appear immune to Vogel

VOGEL (CONTD)
How is she today
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 260309 72

VOGEL (CONTD)
You should let her get more rest
Its a dangerous time the first
month or two of the pregnancy

David stares at him unable to hide his shock

VOGEL (CONTD)
(Beat)
You didnt know

Vogel absorbs this thoughtfully

VOGEL (CONTD)
Youre not the father then
(Beat)I thought it would be you
I thoughtI dont know The way
you look at her The way she
looks at you

David stirs the oatmeal trying to think about what hes
just discovered Vogel doesnt take his eyes off him

VOGEL (CONTD)
Women can be like that they like
to make you dance first I
remember (As though to himself)
So she chose the other one

He shakes his head shrugs

VOGEL (CONTD)
That must be hard watching them
together right in front of you
And you not saying a word Like
the Poet says - Great souls
suffer in silence I wouldnt
have taken Stephan as a family
man Too ambitious too
Whereas you David I see you
with children

DAVID
(Quietly)
Shut up

Vogel stares at him This is the first time someone has

spoken to him in weeks Hes quick to hide his sense of
triumph

VOGEL

I am expressing my sympathy For
your suffering

DAVID

What does a monster like you know
about suffering
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 260309 73

VOGEL
Im a doctor David

David stares at him

DAVID
A doctor (beat) You blind
children trying to change the
colour of their eyes You inject
people with petrol Youyou
replace peoples hands and legs
and you watch as they

He stops himself

DAVID (CONTD)
This isnt medicine This is
disease This is sickness

Vogel seems to consider this
VOGEL
So we were all insane Is that
the answer

DAVID
(Beat)
Theres no answer Im not
looking for an answer Im not
looking for

He forces himself to be silent tries to regain control of
himself He offers Vogel another spoonful but his hand
trembles a little with the violence of his emotions

VOGEL
Youre trembling

David pushes the spoon into Vogels mouth starts to load
another spoonful

VOGEL (CONTD)
Its strange Here I am - the
victim kidnapped bound soon to
be murdered but I think you are
the one that is afraid David
(Beat) Afraid of the monster

He leans closer to David

VOGEL (CONTD)
(Softly)
Boo

They stare at each other eye to eye Vogel senses a new
brittleness in David His tone becomes more assured
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 260309 74

VOGEL (CONTD)
Yes Do you know why it was easy
to exterminate you people
Your weakness I saw it Every
day I saw it Every one of them
thinking only of how to avoid
being flogged or kicked or
killed Only thinking of
themselves

David looks up at him with a strange crooked smile eyes
glittering

VOGEL (CONTD)
Why do you think it only took
four soldiers to lead a thousand
people to the gas chambers
Entire families Because not one
out of thousands had the courage
to resist the courage to be the
first to fall Not one would
sacrifice himself Even when we
took their children from them I
knew then that you people had no
right to live no right to
He may have begun his speech hoping to get a reaction from
David but he has lost himself in his rant and so rather
than triumph we see only a moment of startled fear in his
eyes as David suddenly swings the bowl violently at his
head SHATTERING IT on the pipe to which he is tied

He grabs Vogel by the collar and begins to punch him hard
again and again

Vogel slides sideways limp And still David punches him in
a murderous rage possessed wanting to break his skull
open to kill him

Rachel and Stephan run in with Rachel reaching him first
She throws her arms around him trying to stop him but -
instinctively - he throws a punch behind him It connects

Stephan runs at him knocking him to the floor and remains
lying on him the two of them breathing hard the assault

wrists binding him to the pipe on the wall

Stephan is still struggling with David whos panting
adrenalised staring wildly at Vogels slumped body

VOGEL

Are you going to be alright
Rachel nods
As she hears the door close she turns to stare at Vogel
Hes barely conscious his face smeared with blood

Rachel cleans the blood from VOGELs face He has his eyes
closed

VOGEL
(Mumbling in German)
Thank you

She tears off a new strip of tape and places it over
VOGELs mouth gently

She notices the rain leaking in through the ceiling and
walks off towards the kitchen We hold on Vogel apparently
sleeping Then his tied hand reaches out straining and
manages to reach one of the SHARDS of broken bowl

Rachel gathers three METAL SAUCEPANS

She stops for a moment looking at FIREWORKS flashing in the
sky She remembers - its New Years Eve

We TRACK with her as she walks into the living room and
begins to place the pots on the floor to catch the
rainwater which is dripping through various points in the
ceiling

ON RACHEL

as she finishes with the pots and notices the pieces of
shattered bowl scattered around Vogel She kneels down in
front of him and collects up the pieces She glances up at
Vogel checking him He is still slumped eyes closed

We TRACK with her as she walks back into the kitchen From
the living room comes the three distinct PINGS of rainwater
dripping in the pots

She drops the pieces of bowl into the bin and stops
puzzled Its a moment before she works out what shes
noticed - something has changed in the sound of the
rainwater next door There only two drips instead of three
She walks back towards the living room

RACHELS POV - through the living room door we can see
that one of the pots has been overturned Rachel slows to a
stop A sudden wave of adrenalin causes her to turn
butits too late Vogel steps out of the alcove hes
been standing in so that he is directly in front of her
Before she can even cry out he has slashed her face open
with a SHARD OF GLASS

Instinctively she cups her hands to her ripped face Vogel
grabs her by the hair and stepping behind her tries to
worm his other hand underneath her raised arms to reach her
throat with the glass

Her training kicking in Rachel uses a krav magah move to
grab and twist Vogels forearm breaking his hold on her
and turning the arm until with a yell of pain Vogel drops
the shard He swings wildly at her but Rachel ducks the
fist and drives the palm of her hand up into his face
Vogel stumbles back surprised by her speed and the sudden
pain of the blow

Rachel is about to press home the attack but is blinded by
blood from her wound washing into her eyes

As she wipes her eyes clear Vogel grabs a LAMP from a
small chest of drawers in the hall and smashes it into her
face She falls

Vogel begins to run but driven by adrenaline and
desperation Rachel scrambles onto all fours and lunges at
him catching hold of his trouser leg as he moves towards
the front door

Vogel stumbles manages to pull a leg free and stamps down
on Rachel who lets go with a moan He stamps again steps
free and kicks her hard in the head

Rachel rolls with the force of the kick and comes to a
rest losing consciousness

hard Then he turns and hurries to the front doorand

Rachel is packing folding clothes neatly precisely
silently - but all the time theres a terrible tension
about her movements

She tries to close a drawer but it sticks She keeps
trying then in a sudden rush of fury yanks the drawer free
and hurls it across the room

She stands breathing hard
Then something we didnt see - her gaze settles on a

smiling at us

Rachel stares at the photograph her breathing slowing

He takes out the envelope and slides it across the table
towards her She examines the ticket and passports inside
Then he slides her the BLACK CASE Weve seen this part of
the scene before

She stares at it with disgust knowing what it is Then she
takes it and puts it in her handbag

He points to a waiting area
Rachel walks up the few stairs past a large PILLAR and

takes a seat trying to think of her next step

She glances to her left through the bars and sees an OLD
WOMAN in a patients gown staring blankly at her from the

far end of the corridor A DOCTOR appears and leads the Old
Woman away still staring

Rachel looks away unnerved

Someone has just walked in and is talking to the

she leans slightly to see who it is

The Registrar passes the press card back

handbag and opens it Inside is a pen She lifts this and
the false bottom of the case away to reveal a HYPODERMIC

hands she begins to prepare the injection

She cant quite believe what she is about to do

Rachel enters the room The curtains are drawn and Rachel
hesitates for a moment her eyes adjusting to the gloom

A MAN sits in a chair angled towards the window his back
to us An IV drip hangs on a stand its tube running into a
cannula on the back of a withered hand which hangs from the
chair

The only sound is the faint rasping breath of the man

Rachel moves a little closer On the bottom of the bed
hangs a medical chart The name reads Ivan Schevchuk

Rachel moves closer carefully taking the HYPODERMIC NEEDLE
from her pocket

needle

Beside her the steady breathing alters The Man stirs and
a cadaverous face half turns towards us

As she moves down another corridor

She reaches an opening on her left which reveals a
STAIRCASE winding around a central lift shaft caged in
frosted glass panels

She glances through it as she passes

And just for a second we see an ELDERLY MAN walking down
the stairs

Rachel has walked on a few steps before it registers and
she stops -

VOGEL

She walks back to the opening
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 260309 112

The figure seems to have retraced their steps because they
are now walking FURTHER UP the staircase on the other side
of the lift shaft - a shadowy figure through the frosted
glass which quickly disappears from sight

Rachel stares after him frozen What did she just see

INT STAIRWELL HOSPITAL - DAY

She begins to climb the stairs

INT REC ROOM - DAY

Rachel comes through double doors and finds herself ina
long REC ROOM - PATIENTS and some STAFF grouped around the
room

Rachel begins to walk through the room - elderly men all
around her playing cards reading some sitting staring
vacantly

She walks through them staring at faces Is he here Is he
amongst this ordinary world

She feels her pace quicken as shes drawn on through the
room Its as if shes back at that terrible night Vogels
ahead of her somewhere escaping all over again

She FLASHES through DOUBLE DOORS into a junction area - a
long empty corridor leading away from her on the right
ahead another set of double doors

She bursts through these doors and finds herself in
241 INT LOCKER ROOMBATHROOM - DAY

A long white tiled corridor of a room A row of windows
down the right under which sit WASHBASINS Theres a row
of LOCKERS and DOORS along the left

Rachel walks on feeling increasingly as if shes ina
dream

Shes deep into the room before she realises its a dead-
end - theres no exit ahead of her

VOGEL
(a dull rasp)
Why did you come

She turns and freezes

Vogel has emerged from one of the doorways on the left Now
hes between her and the doors on the far side of the room
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 260309 113

VOGEL (CONTD)
Why did you have to come You
didnt have to follow me

He begins to advance slowly towards her

VOGEL (CONTD)
Was it Schevchuk Did he talk

Rachel stands frozen as he creeps closer He reaches out a
hand as if to reassure her a ghastly attempt at
reasonableness

VOGEL
I can stop him I wont tell him
anymore (Almost pleading) Nobody
needs to know

As if the spell has broken Rachel makes a sudden dart for
the doors But before she can pass him Vogel has moved
with surprising speed and almost before Rachel has seen
the SCISSORS in his other hand he has stabbed them into
her shoulder

She reels over against the opposite wall dislodging a
GLASS SHELF which shatters into a WASHBASIN behind her
Vogel goes after her pinning her against the basin one
hand on her throat the other hand trying to stab her
again Rachel manages to grab the scissor hand and the two
struggle frantically

The scissors inch closer to her FACE to her EYE

Her other hand emerges from the basin behind her holding a
piece of the broken glass shelf which she whips across
Vogels face

He gives a horrible shriek and lets her go clutching at
his cheek

Rachel collapses gasping to the floor

Moaning Vogel stumbles to a basin blood dripping down
onto the white porcelain from his slashed face

He suddenly notices Rachel has made it to her knees and is
trying to crawl towards the door

He walks after her pulls back her head gets ready to stab
the scissors into her throat

VOGEL
You Jews never knew how to kill
Only how to die
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 260309 114

Then he gives a gasp of pain eyes closed his whole body
doubling with the pain hands weakly scrabbling at the
PIECE OF GLASS Rachel has stabbed into his thigh

He falls almost on top of Rachel and she finds herself
pressed against his contorted face as he hisses and spits
in agony

His hand searches blindly for the dropped scissors

Rachel grapples with him almost embracing him apparently
trying to prevent him for reaching it

His searching hand locates the scissors and his eyes open
in triumph staring straight into Rachels He raises the
scissors above his head

Then he stabs Rachel in the stomach

Rachel jack-knifes as if shes been punched
Thennothing Both lie still The only sound is Vogels

rasping breathing

Slowly Vogel gathers himself drops the scissors gets onto
his knees - the victor

He climbs to his feet and begins to limp towards the door

»as he walks down the corridor breathing hard trying to
make it back to his room back to safety

Suddenly he staggers against the wall

Somethings wrong something in his back He twists around
trying to locate the source of the strange sensation And
there it is - the HYPODERMIC NEEDLE Rachel has stuck
between his shoulders

He touches it with his fingertips eyes wide with horror
feeling the rush of lethal chemicals through his blood He

twists again trying to pull the needle free but his legs
are already giving way and he collapses to the floor
