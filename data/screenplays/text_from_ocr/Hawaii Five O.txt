INT WAIHEE TUNNEL 2

The floor of the man-made tunnel runs with a slow but steady
stream of water The FOOTSTEPS cease

A distant FLASHLIGHT BEAM pierces the darkness of one tunnel
and illuminates a point of divergence to another right before
us Hidden in shadow is THE FIGURE OF A MAN gun in hand
eyes that mirror the ghostly light that flutters towards him
off the rock lava walls

The staccato fall of water from the tunnel ceiling strikes
his shaven Buddhalike head and the sinister grotesque
features of WO FAT

THE FLASHLIGHT 3

craftily wedged between the wall and a handrail SLOWLY PULL

A bullet rips into his shoulder His revolver flies from his
hand into the water He vanishes into the other tunnel

LYMAN
Yes it’s wonderful we caught Wo Fat
but the way McGarrett went about it
undermines years of constitutionally
mandated restraint that I have tried
to instill in my own men You can’t
create a police force and expect them
to follow rules while this man cuts
through them like a hot knife through

CHEN KAI
I have never seen it

Lau looks up curiously at the intelligence officer

CONSUL LAU
Take my word for it

Chen Kai sits perfectly upright without appearing rigid His
detachment and self-possession are all too apparent and -
intimidating to Consul Lau

Lau stands circles his desk eyes drawn to Beijing’s best
and brightest to the annoyingly high gloss of his shoes Lau
switches his focus to Honolulu harbor glimmering through his
window

LAU
What do you know about Agent Tan Chi

CHEN KAI
He was part of an American and
Chinese intelligence task force
investigating illegal emigration

LAU
Pure fantasy
CHEN KAT
No doubt but
LAU
- but what
CHEN KAI

According to the US State
department

LAU
Oh an odd boat here or there That’s
no reason to involve ourselves
officially

CHEN KAT
Beijing wishes to appear pro-active
Consul Lau

LAU
(sneering)
- of course We have our favored
nations status to protect

CHEN KAI
It is also the right thing to do

On that note Lau turns gazes quizzically at Chen Kai

LAU
The murder of Tan Chi will require
skilled diplomacy What is your
strong suit Chen Kai

CHEN KAI
I believe MSS calls it ‘Perception
management’ Sir

Chen Kai smiles modestly at Consul Lau

LAU
We shall see The American police
force wishes to exclude us from the
investigation

In all due respect Consul Lau it is
my responsibility not yours to

that takes place in my municipality

LAU
No one questions your authority
Chief Henderson Simply your
willingness to cooperate with our
own

CHIEF HENDERSON
It would help if we knew more about
Agent Tan Chi from your own
government In our country
withholding information in a murder
investigation is a crime

Lau blanches

CHEN KAT

Then the offence is yours Chief
Henderson For without access to the
murder scene what can we give you
when you deny us the means to obtain
it

Chief Henderson glares back at Chen Kai

GOVERNOR
Inspector we’re all on the same side
here

CHEN KAI

Precisely Governor It was in that
spirit that we provided you the
services of a most valued agent
Unfortunately he was murdered

What do you suggest I do Inspector

most qualified for the job

Stinger missiles were hijacked from a
military convoy in the Kolekole road
tunnel We believe Canary was behind
it The black market value of the
missiles -- 50 million We believe
they’ re still in Hawaii For good
reason These missiles are coated
with a special scent sort of like a
perfume Our satellite laser has a
nose for it except when it’s in deep
water Poke it’s head above water and
it’s a bust

MADERA
Mr McGarrett

McGarrett looks up as Madera walks over They stand a foot
apart looking each other in the eyes

MADERA (CONTD)
Is it fair to assume that the murder
of the Chinese agent Tan Chi could be
linked to the hijacked missiles

MCGARRETT
- fair enough

Madera is momentarily thrown

MADERA
- and I assume you’ re conducting the
murder investigation

MCGARRETT
Thats right

Warden how did Dr Fierman determine
Wo Fats death

WARDEN GALE
He listened to his heart his lungs
Examined his eyes They were fixed
and dilated

Warden Gale-is at a loss to where this is going

MCGARRETT
Why didnt Dr Fierman perform an
autopsy

WARDEN GALE

It wasnt called for

MCGARRETT
Had he seen the prisoner for any
medical condition within the 24 hours
prior to his death

WARDEN GALE
No

MCGARRETT
- then he was healthy

WARDEN GALE
Yes

MCGARRETT

Im confused An unintended death
automatically prompts a coroners
inquiry and an autopsy

WARDEN GALE
Dr Fierman conducted a routine
physical of Wo Fat a week before his
death An EKG showed signs of severe
arteriosclerotic heart disease This
was reason enough to disregard a
coroners inquiry

MCGARRETT
Then he wasnt so healthy after all

Warden Gale looks a little uneasy

uphold ‘truth’ as an absolute defense
against it

the dagger in Tan Chis stomach Tan Chi groans in agony
against the unbearable pain His head lowers

Youre not bad yourself The way you
set me up Very impressive

Yes but the way you protected your
turf I had to function within your
parameters
