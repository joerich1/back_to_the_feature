THE GREAT ESCAPE

tn its essence this is the story of a group of
men - and of one man Roger Bushell who was the
colorful leader And yet through it all runs the
theme that even in death man can triumph over any

obstacle

™ my mind this 1s elso the story of a Tower of
Babel The fact that this tower was in reverse
and happened to be a tunnel is a minor point
What was important then - and is more So now -

is that this Tower of Babel was successfully
erected It proves something important In one
magnificent gesture the seventy-six ragged
verminous men of all nationalities who climbed out
of that stinking hole in the ground in Silesia on
that windy March night in 1944 thumbed their
collective nose at the entire Third Reich ané all
it stood for

They triumphed through the only means left to
them over an idea that was rotten from the core
out And they proved for all posterity that men
working together can dig a damned deep hole in
the ground - or build a shining Tower of Babel

A HEAVILY GUARDED TRUCK 1

barrels through the dawning mist It is preceded by

an open car with many uniformed GERMAN SOLDIERS in it -
one stands grimly beside a mounted machine gun which
covers the truck More German soldiers in motorcycle
sidecars flank the truck also guard it warily with
machine guns Following is another open car with another

machine gun pointing towards the truck CAMERA PANS

the convoy around to see ahead many other trucks also
heavily guarded waiting in a formation area Hundreds
of German soldiers ring the whole area Machine guns
at the ready

RAMSEYS VOICE

In some way all countrysides
have a beauty - in peace as
well as war But during a
war the countryside becomes
dominated by other things -

machinery guns bullets men

(pease)
And in the course of war some
men ‘Yive some die and some
are captured
(pause )
Towards the end of World War II
Germany was one vast prison
camp and the problem of containment
of prisoners - slave laborers and
prisoners of war - was acute
Among these there was a small
group of officer POWs who were a
censtant thorn in the German side
for however much the Germans
tried to keep them locked up -
there ‘were escapes and “escapes
and escapes
(beat)

So with simple Teutonic logic the
Germans decided to end once and
for‘all the irritant of this
special group They decided to
concentrate all the worst offenders
fromcamps allover Germany into
a special escape proof camp And
they decidel to watch this camp
very well indeed Its name was
Stalag Luft North

A TRAIN
chugs to a halt at a deserted siding Immediately
hundreds of German soldiers heavily armed converge
as the cattle truck doors are unbolted and a small
group of tired filthy RAF OFFICER POWs jump down
and are guided to covered trucks

cursed by grimfaced guards into the trucks under extreme

up through the ground maneuvers up and ‘down for a few

watching faces of the men in the hut to the rise of the
rod through the ground at regular intervals as the mole-
tunnel moves forward to unconcerned sentries and patrol-

progress towards the woods As the night grows colder
the men notice that a plume of vapor is beginning to

rise from the furthest breathing hole The searchlights

BARTLETT
It is At the same time maybe its
not quite so selfish You might call
it a war effort A lot of fellows
are carrying part of the war ball
we should be carrying (beat)
Ill make it clear for you (beat)
When one man escapes this one man
diverts about a hundred goons from
their war effort if hes caugh
Wathin an hour A thousand goons
if it takes them a day to catch him
Ten thousand if it takes a week
Soldiers police - mainly Say we
multiply that by two hundred and
fifty Think of the monumental muck
up wed cause the goons Why well
