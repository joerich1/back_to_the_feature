An American Werewolf in Paris
BLACKNESS

Pink Floyds Dark Side of the Moon (Brain Damage) plays as WHITE TITLES
appear over black As the song crescendos at the first chorus SUNLIGHT
flares over the lunar horizon and a crescent sliver of THE MOON is
illuminated- huge filling the screen f rom top to bottom Were in space
circling around from the dark side until a HUGE FULL MOON fills the screen
with whiteness- TITLES continue as we pull back from the moon into the
earths atmosphere through CLOUDS until we reveal

PARIS AT NIGHT

We come to rest on an ancient vaguely wolf-like GARGOYLE high atop a
gothic cathedral in the Latin Quarter- a maze of narrow twisting streets-—
desolate at this late hour Clouds move over the moon End TITLES The song
fades A THUNDER CRACK Rain d rops spatter on the churchs metal roof
Water trickles out of the gargoyles mouth We follow the STREAM OF WATER
down to street level where it falls onto

A YOUNG COUPLE

wobbling down the street sharing a bottle of wine They open an umbrella
and stand underneath it smooching and giggling We follow the STREAM OF
WATER from their umbrella to the street where it swirls into drain holes
in the MANHOLE COVER that they re standing on Suddenly

CLANG The manhole cover pushes up under their feet He flinches- bites
down on her lip drawing blood She yelps

CLANG The cover thrusts up again They lose their balance fall to the
ground- the wine bottle smashes The manhole cover flips off its hole

Horrified they scramble from it Then out of it comes

TERRENCE McDERMOTT

a fiftyish college professor in a turtleneck and old tweed jacket
clutching a well worn leather shoulder bag and gasping for breath Hes
balding with longish gray hair and intense eyes He climbs out of the
hole replaces the cover and dashes off de sperately through the rain
looking back over his shoulder as he disappears into a narrow alley

The couple watch him go befuddled She touches her hand to her lip and
looks at the blood She slaps her boyfriend upside the head

GIRL
Idiot

The guy shrugs Then
BAM The manhole cover explodes off the hole sails twenty feet into the
air and clatters to the ground some distance away We cut to the couples

horrified reactions as they watch something emerge from the hole

ON A NEARBY STREET
Terrence running hears the couples horrible SCREAMS echo through the
twisting streets He comes to A STONE STAIRWAY and hurries down it four
steps at a time At the bottom he turns right and arrives at a star shaped
five way intersection

A low muffled growl stops him in his tracks He stands in the rain
panting looking around at the dark maze of streets trying to pinpoint the
source of the sound

TERRENCE
(American accent- to himself
Where are you you sick bastard

A TAXI appears a block away He waves his arms and calls out in a very good
French accent

TERRENCE
Taxi Ici sil vous plait

It turns and drives towards him He starts off towards it He glances over
his shoulder- sees nothing Hes twenty feet from the taxi He smiles
Then-

Hes jerked violently downward into A STORM DRAIN He screams Some
monstrous force pulls him down his bones crushing as his body is forced
through the too-small drain

The CABBY gets out and runs up to the drain where Terrences thrashing
upper body is quickly disappearing into the hole Horrible growls and
sounds of ripping flesh emanate from the sewer BLOOD spurts through the
grate Terrence reaches up to the cab by SCREAMING for help

TERRENCE
My God Help Au securs

The terror stricken cabby shakes his head and starts backing up Terrence
lunges forth and grabs the cabbys leg The cabby screams and tries to get
loose He falls to the ground and is dragged towards the hole He grabs the
bumper of his cab and strai ns to pull himself away kicking at Terrences
hand with his free foot

LIGHTS come on in an adjacent building A MAN in pajamas runs out into the
rain The cabby loses his grip on the bumper and he and Terrence are jerked
closer to the sewer but the man grabs the cabbys hand and pulls Some
OTHER RESIDENTS gather on the sidewalks A police car SIREN approaches

Something gives and the man in pajamas falls backwards into a puddle The
small crowd looks down and sees TERRENCE pulled free from the hole
moaning semi-consciously We move down his body past the bleeding stumps
where his legs used to be and foll ow the BLOOD as it swirls into EDDIES
of rain water and flows into the BLACKNESS of the storm drain

A FIERCE BULL

charges through the matadors red muletta snorting blood The CROWD goes

AMERICAN STUDENTS early twenties

Man I cant believe I paid good money to watch a guy
in tight pants kill a cow

SHERRY
Disgusting This makes American Gladiators look
highbrow

The camera settles on ANDY MCDERMOTT 22 as he joins the crowd in a
rousing cheer waving a bottle of wine with native gusto Hes good looking
in a scrappy sort of way with shoulder length brown hair grungy plaid
shirt khakis and glasses

andy
Whoo Ole

Man you guys are losers This is poetry Death in the
afternoon a tragic dance of man and beast just like
Hemingway said God Spain is it These people know how
to live

SHERRY

andy
Paris Ug If I wanted to be in an overpriced
overrated city full of obnoxious assholes I wouldve
stayed in New York Please

Another friend MIKE joins them

GORD
Whereve you been Beatin off in your sombrero again

Mike swats Steve in the head playfully and grabs the wine from Andy He
hands him a crumpled telegram

MIKE
McDermott your dad sent this to the pensione Supposed
to be urgent

andy
(concerned)

mike
(defensive)

Andy takes the telegram Mike leans in close to Sherrie and whispers the
gossip

mike
His uncle is in the hospital

Andy reads the message His face falls For a second hes silent His
friends see somethings wrong

gord
Hey man You okay What is it

Andy grabs the wine away from Mike and takes a long swig IN THE BULLRING-
the matador plunges his sword between the bulls shoulder blades and makes

INT PARIS HOSPITAL EMERGENCY WARD - EARLY EVENING

BLOOD splatters on white paper Pull back to see a CHEF with a cut finger
standing at the admitting counter dripping blood on a form The uptight
Parisian NURSE scolds him and pulls out a new form

ANDY lugging his back pack trudges through the sliding glass doors marked
St Severin Hospital Bleary eyed hung over burdened by a heavy
backpack and carrying the crumpled telegram he approaches ANOTHER NURSE at
the counter

andy
Um excuse me hello

A STOUT WOMAN with a POODLE charges in front of Andy and launches into a
loud French argument with the nurse over the hospitals humans only
admission policy

WOMAN
(French)
Pitou needs a real doctor Hes melancholy

andy
Hey wait a minute

Andy tries to push his way back in but the shrill little dog yaps at him
Andy grabs his aching hangover head in agony The bleeding chef walks
away dripping leaving the other nurse free Andy approaches her She has
her head down in some paperwor k

andy
Pardon Excusez moi ‘Allo

Without looking up she holds up a please wait finger Andy sighs The
poodle yaps at him again He winces and tries to get the nurses attention

andy
(to Nurse)
Umm

She raises her finger sharply and glares at him She goes back to her
paperwork Andy starts chatting politely with her pretending shes
responding

andy
So you ever been to Spain Youd love it Its
friendly sunny cheap And youd be the only raving

bitch there instead of just one in the crowd up here

MARCEL BOULARD a short middle aged cop in a rumpled coat approaches He
taps Andy on the shoulder

marcel
Andrew Mc-dair-mo

andy
Thats McDermott but yeah

Marcel flashes his badge

marcel
Detective Boulard Weve been expecting you This is
Inspector Leduc

LEDUC in his fifties taller heavy set droopy mustache nods gruffly and
starts towards the elevator motioning for them to follow

This way So youre from New York eh I love those
Hill Street Blues

TERRENCE lies comatose under a clear plastic oxygen tent An ORDERLY
changes the dressing on his bloody stumps A NURSE fiddles with the vast
array of bleeping burbling sucking life support machinery

Andy dumb struck watches from a few paces away Marcel pad in hand asks
him questions Leduc stays in the background listening and studying Andy
intently

andy

marcel
How well did er do you know him

andy
Not too well He taught at the Sorbonne right Dad
always calls him his hippie brother Did some work
with Timothy Leary I think and- Is he is he going
to die

marcel
No The doctors say the machines should keep him going
a long time But basically he is how you say a
legume

andy
Legume You mean a vegetable

marcel
Vegetable right My mistake It seems he was attacked
by a maniac maybe two or three maniacs just after
midnight yesterday They fled into the tunnels beneath
Paris thats all we know

andy
What do you mean maniacs

marcel
Well heres what I think happened A chemistry
professor goes to a bad part of town late at night
Why Perhaps hes making a few francs on the side The
psychedelic drug market is big these days He gets
mixed up with a bad crowd and like they say if you
lie with dogs you get fleas

andy
Yeah well these fleas must have teeth like fuckin
chain saws

BEEP BEEP Somethings wrong with uncle Terrences machinery The IV bottle
is sputtering and bubbling the EKG monitor is flashing The orderlies snap
into action and pull the curtain shut waving no problem to Andy and
Marcel Marcel leads Andy awa y trying to calm him down

marcel

andy

tunnels and find the goddamn animals that attacked
my uncle

marcel

Andy its not so easy There are hundreds of
kilometers of tunnels under Paris Its a whole other
city crawling with drug addicts lunatics

Andys about to protest when Leduc steps in and hands him uncle Terrences
leather bag

leduc

Flocquet Youll be staying there a while

andy

repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness

andy
Why would he pick this one

marcel
I dont know There were others much closer He was
religious

andy
Not that I know

marcel
Well when youre about to pop off what have you got
to lose Thanks for your help

Andys dumbfounded at Marcels lack of tact The elevator doors start to
close Leduc nods good-bye Marcel leans in and sneaks in one last
comment

EXT TERRENCES APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Andy opens the gate of this beautiful 19th century building and walks
through THE COURTYARD to the main entrance A POODLE yaps at him The dog
is in the open doorway of the Concierges apartment which opens into the
courtyard The nosy concierge MAD AME CHRETIEN calls the dog LULU back
in and shuts the door

Andy enters the dark LOBBY finds the timed auto shut-off light switch and
turns it on He boards the old fashioned wire cage elevator and presses the
button for 4 McDermott The elevator ascends painstakingly slowly Andy
resigns himself to waiting thumbs through his uncles date book

Andy turns to the day Uncle Terrence was attacked A circled cryptic entry
at the bottom of the page reads Meet Claude Medusa- 1100 Andy wrinkles
his brow At this second the light goes out

Andy ascends the rest of the way in darkness The doors open on the fourth
floor He gets out and finds his way to the apartment He tries a key in
the lock It wont turn He jiggles it No luck He goes through this with
two more keys grumbling unde r his breath Finally he finds the right one
He pushes the door open and gasps

Hes face to face with a scary TRIBAL MASK hanging in the entrance way It
startles him for a second

andy
This must be the place

INT TERRENCES APARTMENT

Andy walks in and sets down his bags A gun COCKS A young womans voice
screams at him in French

YOUNG WOMAN
(in French)
Who are you What do you want

He turns to see SERAFINE a beautiful young woman around 22 casually
dressed and aiming a pistol at his head He drops the shoulder bag and
reaches for the ceiling
andy
Dont shoot JesusuhJe mappelle Andy McDermott
Je suis le um shit

It dawns on her She drops the gun to her side embarrassed

serafine

Oh fuck you are his nephew

andy
Yeah thats the word And you are

serafine
Serafine Flocquet I work for your uncle

ANDY
You Youre Madame Flocquet I pictured a fat lady with
an apron not- I dont know- La Femme Nikita

Serafine puts the gun away in a drawer

serafine
It sounded like someone picking the lock After what
happened I guess I am a little nervous

She lights a cigarette

andy
Sure I can follow that

serafine
Its a fucking nightmare isnt it

andy
Yeah True The cops werent much help either Their
theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or
something Make sense to you

serafine
Police They have their head in their asshole and they
still cant find shit

andy
Well put So what exactly has uncle Terrence been up
to lately

As he speaks he scans the apartment Its cluttered with an overwhelming
assortment of anthropological oddities from around the globe medieval
illustrations molecular models and an artsy periodic table thats been
used as a dart board

SERAFINE
Hes doing a book with Professor Roussel about
medieval chemistry I was just transcribing his notes
onto the computer and - oh shit

She races out of the room Andy follows after her
INT TERRENCES STUDY

She runs in and finds the computer locked up She smacks it a few times
clicks the mouse taps the keyboard No response

serafine
Salots Shitfucker

andy
(reacts to her loose grasp of American slang)
What

serafine
If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks
up Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking
passwords He was security crazy

She flicks a switch on the back of the computer rebooting it Andy pauses
to look at some nearby photos of his uncle

andy
I still cant get over it The cops said it was a
maniac but he looked like I dont know like hed
gone through a combine harvester or something

Serafine gets kind of emotional at the thought
serafine
They wouldnt let me see him Family only I told them
Terry was almost like a father to me you know
Andy reacts to her use of the informal Terry
andy
Depends Was Terry a father like Ward Cleaver or a

father like Woody Allen

A beat She grasps his meaning Shes offended She starts typing on the
computer giving him the cold shoulder

serafine
You must not have known him very well Hes not like
that

andy

Hey Sorry if I was out of line
serafine
You were I have work to do The publisher wants the

transcripts by Monday Go Make yourself at home

andy
Fine My mistake You know Im gonna be a writer
myself some day

serafine
Uh-huh Good for you

Andy sees hes sunk He heads for the door but something on the wall
catches his eye A small flyer on the bulletin board with a big drawing of
Medusa He takes it down

andy
Medusa Whats this some kind of club

serafine
Its nothing A stupid party Not really a night club

andy

Like an underground club

serafine
Yes Its a bad place Weird people Strange things go

andy
And whos Claude
Serafine looks at him hard questioning
andy
I looked through my uncles date book Writers

curiosity

She points to a paperback on the desk Its French with a psychedelic
cover depicting a man half King Louis XIV half witch doctor The title
(in French) History Inside Out - Psychic Illumination Through the Ages by
Dr Claude Roussel A picture o n the back shows an academic looking Claude
in a tweed jacket with gray hair

serafine
Professor Claude Rousel The one your uncle was working

with He teaches cultural history

andy
In an underground club Id like to see that

He shoves the book in his back pocket Serafines emphatic

serafine
Im serious Theres nothing for you down there Its
dangerous

andy

Come on Im from New York - the shoot me state
Dont wait up
He starts for the door She spins him around by the sleeve

seraFine
(suddenly quite angry)
What good can you do Why are you being so fucking
stupid

andy

(getting fired up)
Maybe I didnt know him like you did But hes my
uncle And I owe it to him to get some answers Its a
quest like uh Hemingway the Old Man and The Sea
Except instead of an old man Im a young man and
instead of the sea its a bunch of tunnels u nder
Paris And instead of a big fish its who knows
Thats what Im going to find out Au revoir

He walks out of the office She calls after him

The front door slams She looks after him incredulous

EXT RUE DENFER - NIGHT

A MEDUSA HEAD is carved in the stone above the doorway of a crumbling old
facade in a rundown Parisian neighborhood Andy tries the front door Its
locked Theres no sounds or signs of life

andy
(to himself)
Some party

Andy starts off then pauses as three PARTY GOERS approach the door
Theyre modern-primitives- tribal tattoos pierced noses and weird
beaded hair One fishes a key from the Medusas mouth opens the door and
lets the group in

Andy slips in behind them One GUY in the group looks Andy over and mutters
something in French to his friends They snigger amongst themselves and
walk to a door across the foyer Andy follows a few paces behind through
the door down some stairs i nto

A DILAPIDATED BASEMENT

Lit with a few candles They walk past an old boiler through another door
into
A NARROW STONE SPIRAL STAIRCASE

They proceed down the ancient stairway also lit only by the occasional
candle placed on the steps They reach the bottom of the steps and enter a
dark drippy stone tunnel still lit by candles Some rats scurry away
through the puddles under Andys f eet

Candles lead the way through the maze of intersecting tunnels Some
graffiti scratched in the wall catches Andys eye Jean Philippe 1803 He
pauses to look at it for and loses the group ahead of him He follows the
candles on his own turning right left and left again A loud muffled
bass beat gets louder He rounds the corner into

THE WILD UNDERGROUND PARTY SPACE

In an open cavern lit with torches and strobe lights Two hundred people
are gyrating to eerie techno-tribal dance music Its a weird crowd mostly
young modern primitive pierced and grungy RAVERS many wearing day-glo
tribal face paint Clusters of sullen militant SKINHEADS hang around the
periphery

An attractive blissed-out WAIF approaches Andy with a paintbrush and a jar
of day glo face paint and a brush She goes to paint Andys face He stops
her

andy
Thats alright Ill be a cowboy

She smiles and pushes his hand down He shrugs and lets her paint two day
glow red stripes on his cheeks

andy
Alright Fine
(with mock enthusiasm)
Ooh I can feel it tingling

Andy sniffs and makes a face- the paint has a weird smell

andy (contd)
Phew Whats in this stuff liquid plumber
(he pulls the book out of his pocket and
shows her Claudes picture)
Do you know this guy Claude

waif
Ah oui le professeur La bas

She points to a dark alcove off the main cavern Andy nods and starts off
We move in on a leather clad young man leaning against the wall watching
Andy go This is GASTON DUFAUX a self-styled Parisian thug who seems to
be cultivating a sort of Mic key Rourke look He takes a drag from his
cigarette and we see hes missing two fingers

Andy makes his way through the crowd People are dancing with wild abandon
and many carry torches A SKINNY GUY IN A DIAPER and a paper mache skull
mask runs through the crowd ranting and spraying fluorescent silly string
He does a weird dance aroun d Andy and jabbers at him in French

andy
Uh lemme get back to ya on that

Andy approaches the side room and peers in A small group of young people
are listening intently to CLAUDE whose back is to us Hes expounding
about something in a solemn tone

claude
(French to group)
How ironic A man who dedicated his life to opening
the doors of the mind now lies trapped behind them
Locked behind a door without a key

We follow Andy as he steps around the crowd and sees Claudes face He
looks older than in the photo- hes in his late fifties with white hair
and intense eyes

ANDY
Excusez moi I

Claude notices the book in Andys hand He speaks fluent English

claude
Im sorry my friend Im not signing books right now
Theres been a tragedy

andy
I know Im Andy McDermott Terrences nephew

Claude is taken by surprise

claude
My God Im sorry But how did you find your way down
here Wait lets go talk

He excuses himself from his flock and leads Andy to a quiet corner of the
room The kids disperse several looking sympathetically at Andy

claude
Its horrible Terrence was one of the most brilliant
men Ive known

andy
Yeah well why did he hang out here The cops said
its dangerous-—

Claude
The cops Its their backward laws that force all this
underground in the first place endangering people
whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception
exploring new states of psychic awareness
Theyre suddenly doused with day-glo silly string as the jibbering idiot in
the diaper pops in to deliver a rant at them

GUY IN DIAPER
(French)
The moon is bleeding Prepare for the downpour

He ducks back out Andy picks the silly string out of his hair

andy
Psychic awareness Right

claude
You think its silly But do you realize that young man
is actually in a deep sleep

andy
What

claude
Hes on a new drug called ZBH or Daydream It allows
the user to be fully alert and mobile while hes
dreaming He is literally conscious and unconscious at
the same time

andy
Yeah well thats like really groovy and everything
but who hacked my uncles legs off

Claude frowns He looks grave

claude
Andy

andy
Yeah

claude

Terrence and I came down here to do serious work For
centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures
mainstream society would not tolerate

He gestures to the main cavern where people are far gone into various
states some in a trance some gyrating lustily to the eerily hypnotic
music We intercut with these images as Claude speaks

claude (contd)

ese people carry on traditions dating back to pagan
imes- the ancient quest for expanded consciousness At
e same time theyre pioneering a chemical revolution
owerful state-of-the-art compounds But you know
at I mean

(he gestures to Andys face paint)
A year ago who would have dreamed of topically applied
hallucinogens like TMD Except Terry of course

ST try

Andys eyes widen with comprehension He touches his face
andy
What Hallucinogen Oh shit

He rubs the face paint off with his shirt sleeve

claude

You didnt know But then why did you well dont
worry Its relatively mild

andy
Yeah well if I claw my face off just pack it in ice
okay Jesus the cops were probably right My uncle

was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went
berserk on him

Claude lowers his voice He looks grim

claude
No We stumbled on something else down here Andy
Something horrible almost unbelievable But very real
Its been going on for centuries though most people
wouldnt believe it or wouldnt want to

Andys somewhere between spooked and incredulous He glances at the book in

his hand

Andy turns and sees

andy
Wait a second are you like the Steven King of France
or something

serafine (os)
Andy

Serafine run up to him She looks worried
ANDY
So you came after all Just in time its getting

interesting

serafine
You must get out of here Its not safe

She grabs him by the arm He resists

ANDY
Not you too-

CLAUDE
(checks his watch)
My God Serafines right Its time to go Well talk
soon

serafine
Bon nuit Claude
(to Andy)
Come on
Claude dashes off Serafine drags Andy into the main cavern

andy
Hey chill out a second

She leads him across the cavern towards the entrance Andy stops short and
pulls away from her Its not easy- she has a strong grip

Andy
Alright hold on Im not gonna get dragged around like
some kid in a shopping mall I want you to answer some
questions

Serafine sees something over Andys shoulder

serafine
Merde I knew I shouldnt have come here

Andy turns to see Gaston approaching He leers at Serafine

gaston
(Frenc
Serafine mon cher I hear your boss looks great in
cut-offs
serafine
(Frenc

Get the fuck away from me Gaston

gaston

(Frenc
First you tell me where the ADM is eh

He puts his hand on her shoulder Andy notices the missing fingers

serafine
(French)
Fuck you

She shoves his hand away and pulls Andy past him Gaston grabs her and
spins her around This time Andy grabs Gastons hand and pulls it off her
He holds up Gastons three fingered hand and glares at him

andy
Well this explains the two fingers they found in
Liberaces asshole
Gaston jerks his hand away He stabs his finger in Andys chest
gaston
In Paris we have an expression for people like you

Enculé dAmericain

andy
Yeah In New York we got an expression too Goes like
this

CRACK Andy hauls off and belts Gaston in the jaw as hard as he can But
Gaston doesnt even lose his footing He sneers with rage and hits Andy
with a vicious combination His glasses fly off as he reels into the crowd
knocking a few people into a gr oup of nearby SKINHEADS The skinheads
erupt into randomly directed violence- a full fledged BRAWL breaks out
Its chaos

On the floor Andy squirms away from the skinheads and retrieves his
glasses He hears Serafine call his name He gets up amidst the mayhem and
sees Serafine being carried away by the crowd

andy
Serafine

Someone knocks into Andy and he falls to the ground He gets back on his
feet- Serafines nowhere in sight He pushes his way through the crowd
looking for her He catches sight of her white dress in a distant corner
Its there for a second and then gone again - apparently into a tunnel He
runs over to it

Andy peers into THE TUNNEL which houses some old pipes It fades quickly
into darkness He grabs a kerosene torch from the wall and runs into the
tunnel About a hundred yards in he passes an ALCOVE

He leans in with his torch and peers around The cave like room is empty
but something catches Andys eye Scratched into the stone wall amidst
various graffiti is A PENTAGRAM It looks to be centuries old

Andys transfixed by it The sound of his own breathing suddenly becomes
deafening and his vision begins to distort the textures of the stone wall
begin to churn and crawl and the flames from his torch melt into different
hues The pentagram glows an d seems to grow out of the wall

The hallucinatory flash is over as fast as it began Panting stunned Andy
shakes it off He wipes his face checking for traces of paint He tries to
reassure himself

andy
Whoa Cmon

A womans SCREAM echoes through the tunnels He runs towards it

Andy
Serafine

Another scream- anguished tortured Andy runs faster He arrives at an
intersection with another tunnel turns the corner and finds

A decrepit old WINO hogging a bottle from his warty HAG companion
provoking her to scream like she just lost her only son They look up at

Andy The hag shuts up They fix Andy with an odd stare

andy
SorryI uh did you see a girl la femme um avec
la dress blanc

They just stare at him Spooked he walks past them They follow him with
their creepy stare as he continues into the tunnel which slopes downhill

He comes to an old stairway leading down into darkness WATER pours out of
a hole in the ceiling The steps are severely eroded and slick with flowing
water and moss Andy sees something Its SERAFINES SHOE laying on a
landing a few yards down the s tairs He leans in further loses his
footing and slips

andy
Ahh Son of a bitch

He shoots down the stairs on his back past the shoe which lies at the
mouth of an intersecting tunnel His glasses come off The torch goes out
He stops at the bottom of the stairs on a gravel surface

He winces a bit as he sits up Its too dark to make much out He feels
around the gravel finds his GLASSES - theyre shattered He scowls He
stands up and walks ahead feeling his way along the slick wall peering
into the darkness

ANDY
SERAFINE

The echo sounds different- like hes in a larger space The echo decays
into a familiar low RUMBLE

A reflection of light appears in a puddle on the floor The light gets
brighter until Andy sees the subway tracks at his feet The rumble gets
suddenly louder as

A METRO TRAIN

barrels around the corner flooding the tunnel with light and closing on
Andy fast

andy
Oh shit

He turns and runs for THE STAIRWAY He skids on the gravel and overshoots
it He scrambles back and up into it just as THE TRAIN whooshes past

Andy scurries a few feet up the slick steps using a rusty pipe for a
handhold As he looks back at the SPARKING RUSHING TRAIN WHEELS his heart
pounding in his head he has another HALLUCINATORY-FLASH the sparks
explode into streaking patterns of co lor and light

It passes quickly The train goes by and its rumble fades Andy squeezes
his temples and takes a deep breath Before he finishes exhaling an
UNEARTHLY HOWL echoes through the tunnels The howl literally takes his
breath away- hes frozen there eyes w ide not breathing for a long
moment

Quietly carefully he makes his way back up the dark wet stairs He comes
to the landing picks up Serafines shoe and steps into the INTERSECTING
TUNNEL He squints into the darkness Without his glasses ANDYS POV is a
bit blurry He walks into the tunnel Another HOWL Andy swallows hard

andy
Jesus Christ

He hurries along WATER DRIPS from the tunnel ceiling down the walls onto
the cobblestone floor flowing into rivulets around Andys feet and joining
a stream that flows ahead of him disappearing into the blackness ahead He
approaches another inter section He stumbles over something

He looks down and makes out a GIRLS BARE LEG lying in a puddle in the dark
intersecting tunnel He follows the leg up with his eyes- its messily
severed above the knee He gasps

He looks further into the tunnel and sees A PAIR OF GLOWING YELLOW EYES
staring back at him out of the darkness Andy turns and runs

With a horrible ROAR the eyes lunge after him and turn the corner As it
gains on Andy we see the dim outline of the massive wolf-like beast

Andy dives for a SMALL CONDUIT barely big enough for his body and
wriggles into it Behind him the yellow eyes appear at the mouth of the
conduit - the beast SNARLS but cant fit in Andy can see a dim light at
the end of the conduit He crawls along

He emerges into ANOTHER TUNNEL Some thirty yards away light and street
noise come through a GRATE on the ceiling of an antechamber beyond an iron
gate Relieved Andy starts off towards it A SNARL stops him in his
tracks THE BEAST comes tearing aro und a corner fifty yards behind him

Andy breaks into a sprint towards the antechamber He slips on the wet
floor and lands in a puddle drenching himself The beast closes in

Andy gets up runs into the antechamber and slams the iron gate shut
Theres a rusty DEADBOLT lock on the gate but no key The beast is twenty
five yards away and closing fast - its massive silhouette filling the
diameter of the tunnel

Andy whips out his SWISS ARMY KNIFE opens the screw driver and tries it in
the old-fashioned keyhole- it doesnt work The beast is twenty feet away

Andy tries the can opener- no luck Ten feet Andy jams the corkscrew into

the hole The beast leaps The corkscrew turns The DEADBOLT SLIDES

SLAM The beast rams the gate shaking the anteroom But it holds Flashes
of CLAWS and TEETH thrash through the bars but its still too dark to make
the beast out clearly Andy runs across the anteroom grabs the steel sewer
grate on the ceiling an d hoists himself up

Through the bars he sees a BUSY BOULEVARD in the Pigalle (the Times
Square of Paris) Theres a COP a few paces away Andy screams to him

ANDY
HELP OFFICER

ON THE BOULEVARD- Over the roar of traffic and midnight revelers the cop
can barely pinpoint Andys screams He looks around confused He sees Andy
and angrily shakes his baton at him

cop
(French)
Hey You shouldnt be down there

ANDY
FOR GODS SAKES LET ME OUT

THE BEAST slams the gate wrenching one of the iron bars loose- two more
bars and itll fit through Andy jumps down picks up the loose bar Its
got a STAR SHAPED SPEAR TIP

He rushes at the gate and jams the spear through the gate aiming for the
thrashing teeth and eyes in the darkness

The beast ducks and the spear sinks a couple of inches into the BACK OF
ITS NECK and stops apparently on bone It recoils and ROARS with pain
shaking the spear free

ON THE STREET- The cop raps the bars with his nightstick and peers into the
dark anteroom

COP
(in French)
You are not allowed down there

IN THE ANTEROOM- The beast rams the gate- its rage redoubled Andy jumps
up and grabs the grate

andy
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE

ON THE STREET

COP
(French)
Fuck You think I dont know this word fuck Is
that how you talk to policemen in America

Enraged the cop runs to his car muttering to himself He opens the trunk
and rummages around for something

IN THE ANTEROOM- The beast knocks another bar off the gate Andy watches in
horror as it rams even harder loosening the NEXT BAR

andy
(to the cop)
FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK

ON THE STREET- The cop looks over at Andy incensed He takes a crowbar
from the trunk runs back cussing in French and struggles with the grate

IN THE ANTEROOM- The NEXT BAR on the gate gives The beast sticks its head
through the gap and focuses its searing yellow eyes on Andy It rears
back ready to pounce
THE GRATE- comes up The cop grabs Andy and pulls

IN THE ANTEROOM- Andys legs dangle like bait The beast lunges teeth and
claws bared

ON THE STREET- Andy screams as a bus roars by The cop pulls him up and
out Andys right pants leg is torn open and hes bleeding from a GOUGE in
his ankle

cop
(French)
Okay what the hell are you up to

ANDY
It bit me My leg Jesus its down there shoot it
Shoot it for Christs sakes

He points frantically at the open hole The cop aims his flashlight in the
hole Its empty He looks Andy up and down

COp
(French)
Your passport

Shaking Andy takes his passport out of his pocket The cop takes it and
copies some information Andy raves at him- a blur of English and broken
French

andy
Theres something down there A bear or something A
god damn monster Beau coup teeth Huge Grande with
yellow eyes all this hair it killed Serafine My
God

cop
You on drugs Huh

andy
(he falters)
NoI

He looks disoriented half-crazed He definitely seems like hes on drugs
The cop shines his flashlight in Andys eyes- his PUPILS are like saucers

ANDYS POV

The cops flashlight sparks another HALLUCINATORY FLASH The cops face
melts like liquid sounds swirl together the garish neon signs of The
Pigalle explode into streaking colors and we BURN INTO WHITE

This looks familiar

serafine
Ahh Rodin Mmm Hes the fuc-

and laughs)
I mean hes the best You must go to the Rodin
sculpture garden in the huitieme its so beautiful

She gestures across the river Andy looks at the gorgeous panorama

andy

He looks at Serafine She looks back at him He holds up The Kiss

andy
I bet youre pretty good at this too

She smiles playfully

serafine

He shakes his head no and moves towards her They kiss tenderly They
separate and share a deep passionate look They kiss again hungrily
falling into a passionate embrace Theyre really going for it Her NAILS
dig into his back He pulls her bod y into his until they look like one
form- just like Rodins sculpture

APPLAUSE and CHEERS break the moment A TOURIST BOAT is gliding by on the
Seine its ELDERLY PASSENGERS applauding the young couple Serafine pulls
away blushing a little and turns to the boat ANDY doesnt even notice
the boat Hes staring at Sera fine with a scary kind of intensity She
starts to say something but he starts kissing her again cutting her off

Suddenly hes out of control pawing at her It takes an effort for her
to pull back from him

serafine
Hey calm down a second
She looks into his eyes and freezes with fear HIS STARE is terrifying
totally predatory inhuman Somethings ignited in him She pushes him away
and shakes him

serafine
Whats wrong with you

Andy blinks and seems to come a couple of steps back to normality

andy
What Arent I a good kisser Whats the matter

She fixes him with a heavy suspicious stare She glances down at his
ankle where the bottom of HIS WOUND is visible She seems to understand
something She fumbles in her purse takes out a compact mirror and checks
her face

She gets up and starts off He looks after her

to his glass of wine and chugs it He puts the bottle to his lips and takes
a long belt He picks up the big block of pate and bites into it like a
piece of cake He likes it He takes another huge bite He looks after
Serafine He gets up

Ah bite me

He glares at the tough and his growling dog The dog suddenly shrinks back
in fear and decides its time to leave He pulls his owner along Andy
continues on his way He ditches the half finished crepe Thats not what

Andy comes upon a trendy little CAFE with several tables of diners eating
in the open air Andy notices an attractive young blond sitting alone
thumbing through a Lets Go guide This is AMY SINGLETON Andy approaches

Three successive tables of upscale PARISIAN DINERS are gawking at
something At one table Inspector Marcel hides behind his menu and shakes
his head in disdain

We follow their glances to Andy greedily licking the last bits of Steak
Tartar off his plate Amy giggles in amazement as she pours the last from
the bottle of wine Shes a bit drunk- enough to be amused by Andys
antics

amy
God How can you eat like that

andy
Its all in the tongue Another bottle

Amy laughs and nods yes JEAN-LUC 25 a well dressed powerfully built
Frenchman enters He kisses Amy on both cheeks all the while watching Andy
uneasily

amy
Jean-Luc Youre kinda late sweetie

jean-luc
I was busy Is this a friend of yours

amy
Well yeah kinda but-

andy
Were so much more than friends Were soul mates sex
slaves pen pals the whole nine yards Well nine
yards is a slight exaggeration but believe me for a
white boy I got nothing to be ashamed of

Amy laughs in mid gulp and wine comes through her nose Andy looks at
Jean-Luc who is - of course - pretty steamed
andy
Hey Im kidding Its a joke Here maybe if I say
it in metric
Jean-Luc grabs Andy by the collar and pulls him to his feet

jean-luc
Think youre smart huh

Amy tries to intervene

amy
Jean-Luc dont be a jerk

She tries to pull his hands off Andy but Jean-Luc sends her reeling back
with a firm shove

andy
Hey look man she-

Jean-Luc brings his hand back and slaps Andy in the mouth

jean-luc
Shut up Why are you Americans always so loud

andy
I dont know Maybe its so we can drown out the sound
of your mother fucking the navy

Jean-Luc takes a swing at Andy With amazing reflexes he dodges it deftly
Jean-Luc jabs- again Andy avoids it easily He smiles impressed with
himself Jean-Luc is incensed

He goes for Andys throat but Andy catches him by the arm and with
superhuman strength FLIPS him head over heels through the air and -
SMASH - onto a nearby table

Andy casually leans past the semi-conscious Jean-Luc and plucks a CHAMPAGNE
BOTTLE out of its ice bucket The WAITER is about to object but thinks
better of it Andy takes Amy by the arm she grabs the RED WINE BOTTLE and
they start off away from the cafe

amy
Wow You know Kung Fu or something

andy
(amazed at himself)
Yeah Apparently
In the background Marcel hurries to pay his tab and follow them He slips
on some of the broken glassware spilled by Jean-Lucs fall and almost goes
for a tumble himself
FURTHER DOWN THE STREET
Amy and Andy walk together Shes still giddy

amy
Ha ha You were probably right about his mom

Hope I didnt hurt him too bad

their mouths Sweat and wine drip off their naked bodies The sex heats up
to an intense screaming clim ax Amy squeals with ecstasy

amy
My God Youre an animal

But Andys still accelerating- transported to another plane Sweat pours
from his brow His face contorts with each groan but now its hard to tell
if its from pleasure or pain His body jerks violently and his skin
suddenly blushes bright red Amy w inces

amy
Ahh Jesus Youre burning hot What the hell-

AHHHHHHH

Marcel is a little disconcerted

MARCEL
(French to himself
Alright already you passed the audition for Gods
sakes

Andys skin literally glows red turning his sweat to steam He leaps off
Amy and disappears into the sprawling cemetery screaming in agony Amy
watches him go

amy
Hey where are you going

Marcel starts off after Andy taking the wide route around Amy Andys
scream echoes through the cemetery Amy pulls her dress on

AMY
Creep

ANDY

red hot (literally) weaves through the tombs screaming He comes to a
small courtyard with an ORNATE FOUNTAIN He dives into the brackish water
Clouds of steam rise off the water as he thrashes about under the marble
goddess in the center of the fou ntain

AMY
searches through the graveyard Shes got Andys clothes

amy
I dont know whats wrong with you man but I got your
pants so we better talk

THE FOUNTAIN

Andys gurgling screams are changing becoming less human We catch
glimpses of body parts as they surface from the churning froth- GROTESQUE
FLAILING LIMBS somewhere in mid-transformation between human and beast

MARCEL

steps cautiously through the ancient ornate tombs and mausoleums
listening to the distant splashing and sporadic inhuman screams He draws
his gun and loads a cartridge Suddenly a horrible grunt and loud SMASH
pierce the air Marcel wheels around an d smacks nose first into a
gravestone
marcel
Merde

AMY

in another part of the graveyard stops in her tracks listening Another
SMASH followed by crumbling and rushing water

amy
(to herself)
Hes gone psycho ballistic This is bad

Amy feels something and looks down Theres a stream of water flowing
around her feet She follows it towards its source and steps into

THE COURTYARD

The fountain has been smashed- the stone rim cracked into bits and the
center statue fallen to the ground Theres no sign of Andy Amy walks up
to the fountain

AMY
Oh my God

She notices something on the ground Its the STONE GODDESS smashed into
several pieces We hear a low growl Amy looks up terrified She scans the
GRAVES around the perimeter of the courtyard She takes a few tentative
steps backward

Suddenly a MASSIVE TOMBSTONE is wrenched off its base (most of the ancient
stone markers are eroded and crumbling- many already fallen over) It falls
like a tree revealing the familiar pair of piercing yellow eyes behind it
framed by the dim outline of a massive beast Amy emits an odd primitive
whine

amy
Unnnhh

She runs away from the beast across the courtyard and disappears into the
graves

In the DENSE FOREST OF TALL TOMBSTONES Amy zigs and zags through narrow
spaces barely wide enough for her slender body to fit through The camera
CRANES UP

HIGH ANGLE

Thirty paces behind Amy pairs of tombstones split apart like jungle
vegetation crashing thunderously to the ground The unseen beasts path is
slowed by the monuments but still follows Amy

Amy looks back as she runs She sees the tops of tombstones fall behind
her She comes to a railing at the top of a fifteen foot wall separating a
LOWER LEVEL of the cemetery She hangs over the edge and quietly drops

She runs down a path comes to an intersection where six paths converge She
looks down each of them but cant see the outer walls of the cemetery-
just an endless landscape of graves She sprints down a path and ducks
behind A LARGE CRYPT

Up on the higher level the beast howls She looks up and sees its
silhouette sniffing the air the full moon looming behind it She looks up
at the iron door on the crypt Then she reaches into her purse

THE BEASTS POV

Its HEAVY BREATH dominates the soundtrack It scans the sprawl of graves
from its perch on the hill sniffing It locks its stare on the large
crypt It sniffs again With a growl it leaps over the railing (we stay
with its POV) and hits the ground r unning It runs up a twisting path
closing in on THE CRYPT It arrives at the back of the crypt and circles
it sniffing It stops in front of the door

THE BEASTS EYES

Narrow and glow with intense predatory focus

INSIDE THE CRYPT

Were looking at the door CRASH It flies open revealing the snarling
beast backlit by the moon It lunges in and stops

THE BEASTS POV

Scans back and forth- the crypt is empty The beast sniffs again and growls
with rage

AMY

somewhere else in the graveyard sprays a long blast of perfume into
another crypt and sneaks into the endless maze of tombs We hear the
enraged beast smash into another crypt a hundred yards away

Amy comes to ANOTHER FOUNTAIN and slips into the water quietly rinsing
herself

THE BEASTS POV

smashes into another crypt Nothings inside It backs up and runs to
another crypt SMASH Nothing The growls grow more furious It crashes
down another door Nothing

Amy dripping wet pads down a row of ancient family mausoleums She pauses
as the beast lets loose a horrible howl and topples a monument some
distance away She tries the heavy iron door on a SMALL GOTHIC MAUSOLEUM
It opens She slips inside

IN THE MAUSOLEUM

Amy crouches under the small portal and STAIN GLASS WINDOW which depicts
the Virgin Mary She struggles to quiet her breathing and listens
She hears only the trickling water from the nearby fountain Then some
crackling twigsthen a SNIFFanother SNIFF closer Trembling Amy
quietly raises herself peers out the portal and sees

MARCEL

Standing a few paces away SNIFFING and trying to stem the flow from his
bloody nose

marcel
Merde

Amy breaths a sigh of relief Then-

THE BEAST springs out of the darkness behind Marcel- a blur of eyes claws
and teeth- and tackles him to the ground

IN THE MAUSOLEUM

Amy drops down to the floor huddled in terror A GUN SHOT hits the STAIN
GLASS above Amys head shattering the Holy Virgin Another GUN SHOT
followed by a ROAR OF PAIN from the beast But the pained roar quickly
becomes VICIOUS SNARLING again There are no more shots just horrible
snarls screams and ripping flesh BLOOD splatters through the portal and
drips down Amys face She hunkers down Then the sound of steps going
away and at lastsilence

Amy waits We hear only the fountain and another closer DRIPPING Its
Amys wet clothes still dripping into A PUDDLE on the floor which is
dripping UNDER THE IRON DOOR into a small STREAM flowing on the otherwise
dry STONE WALKWAY away from the M ausoleum

In the mausoleum Amy listens a bit more Satisfied the coast is clear she
quietly turns to the iron door grasps the handle and slowly turns it But
before it clicks open-

RRRIIP The iron door is wrenched out of Amys hand and
off its hinges revealing

THE BEAST up close and in clear view for the first time- its truly
awesome- a huge leering mouth full of razor sharp teeth a hulking body
built like a wolf but as massive as a bear and vaguely humanoid paws with
big hook claws Theres a bloody FLE SH WOUND in its right shoulder

It snarls savagely at Amy She chokes out a little cry The beast lunges

OUTSIDE THE MAUSOLEUM - HIGH ANGLE

The beasts powerful hind section sticks out of the mausoleum kicking a
bit as it rips into its prey The graveyard sprawls endlessly under the big
moon which hangs low in the sky

sees- A CROW picking at the scant remains of Lulu ringing the collar bell
with its beak She SCREAMS

INT TERRENCES APT - SAME TIME

Andy wakes up in a cold sweat naked on his Uncles couch The phone is
ringing He looks disoriented confused We hear Madame Chretien screaming
in the background

andy

He sits up to get the phone and becomes dizzy- he grabs his head He
reaches for the phone and winces- theres a crusted over FLESH WOUND on his
right shoulder He picks up the phone

andy

ANDY

serafine (0S)
Listen Im coming over Dont go anywhere Stay right

She hangs up Andy is very confused He sees the front door- its ajar and
the door frame has been splintered where the deadbolt sits Stunned he
stands up only to double over with a wave of nausea He covers his mouth
and runs stooped over to the ba throom

He leans over the toilet and vomits After a few heaves his body relaxes
and he catches his breath He opens his eyes and looks down in the bowl-
horror and disbelief sweep over his face as he focuses on

A HUMAN EYEBALL

staring back at him from the bloody water The iris is a familiar shade of
sparkling blue

ANDY
Oh nono

The doorbell rings He leaps up flushes the toilet and runs out of the
bathroom still naked to find himself in full view of Leduc and two
UNIFORMED COPS standing in the open door One of the cops is examining the
splintered door frame

Leduc looks to be in an even worse mood than usual His English is rough
but firm

INT POLICE MORGUE - MORNING

severed human foot nothing else

Leduc Andy and the technician stand by the drawer in this dreary room
Leduc never takes his eyes off Andys face

leduc
You recognize her

andy

Leduc looks down sees the foot and barks at the technician

leduc
(French)
Thats the wrong one

The technician checks his clipboard and tries another drawer It contains a
rotting ARM Leduc curses under his breath He and the technician start
opening drawers at random peeking in then slamming them shut

andy
(nervous)

You uh you want to tell me what this is about

Leduc ignores him continuing to open drawers The technician appears to
have found the right one at the far end

technician
Inspector Cest le voici

A little exasperated Leduc and Andy go over to see what the technician has
found Once again

AMYS MANGLED CORPSE

Leduc gives him the nod He opens the drawer to reveal

Its badly lacerated Parts of her throat and midriff are missing and she
has only one eye Andy gasps in horror

leduc
We know you were with her

andy
Oh shit No

leduc
Thats not all
(he reaches for another drawer above Amys)
Marcel- Officer Boulard was
following you

andy
Oh no no

He pulls open the drawer to reveal MARCELS MANGLED CORPSE Theres a
gaping hole in his midsection

leduc
He was a good man Now his wife is a widow

andy
(overcome)
This is its like a sick joke I-

Leduc grabs Andy by the collar and slams him against the wall

leduc
This is not a joke Not a dream These people are dead
and--

TAP TAP Through the small window in the door he sees CHIEF PICARD his
superior trying to get his attention

He leaves the room

leduc
Merde Wait here When I return you tell me about
last night huh

andy
But I dont remember anything I swear

leduc

(sternly)
I leave these open Maybe something comes back to you

The technician leaves too Andys alone staring at the

corpses Through the window he can see Leduc arguing loudly with his
superior Andy tries to breath deeply calm down He turns back to look
at Amys corpse Suddenly her eyes - well her eye - snaps open and looks
straight at him

amy

andy
Aaaaa Jesus This isnt happening Im still

Andy storms around in a fit of disbelief
amy

Leduc and the Chief have stopped their argument briefly to watch Andy
stomping around gesturing wildly They resume their argument

(French)

Someth-

chief

Dont give me your black magic bullshit Seven
mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a
scrawny American boy Do you have a motive

(Leduc hesitates)
Do you have a weapon Or do you want me to believe he
did it with his own two hands

leduc
(exasperated)

The Chief rolls his eyes here we go again style Meanwhile
INSIDE THE ROOM

Andy is still pacing the room madly

The chief leaves Leduc scowls He looks in at Andy still gesticulating
wildly and talking to thin air Leduc reenters the room and looks at Andy
bitterly

leduc

Andy looks from Leduc to the drawers and back again

Andy socks Marcel and breaks his jaw- off It skitters off into the street
He punches him in the gut- SKLURCH His fist gets stuck in the tangle of
Marcels abdominal organs

While Andy tries to pull his hand free Amy rears back and kicks him in the
balls He wrenches his hand loose and staggers back clutching his groin

ANDY
Hey you cant kick me Youre an apparition

AMY
What all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural
law
Marcel fits his jaw back into place
marcel

Call it the power of suggestion

He socks Andy in the mouth Andy shakes it off rips Marcels arm off
bashes him in the face with it then turns around and uses it to beat Amy
over the head Meanwhile

IN AN UNMARKED POLICE CAR PARKED A HALF BLOCK AWAY

RENE and FRANCOIS the two cops who accompanied Le Duc to Andys apartment
watch Andy whirl around the sidewalk swinging wildly at the air reacting
to invisible blows and cursing unseen enemies

RENE
(French)
You know in his own way hes probably happier than
any of us
Francois nods philosophically Meanwhile back in Andys reality

Marcel has got him in a full Nelson and Amy is punching him in the stomach
He bucks forward wrenching both of Marcels arms off and slams them
together onto Amys head knocking her down Andy waves Marcels arms in
triumph

andy
Ha-ha

amy
Oh big man You can beat up a couple of cadavers Well

kill yourself at midnight tonight youre gonna
transform and murder innocent people

MARCEL
What are you going to be McDermott A coward and a
murderer Or a man with guts enough to do the right
thing

over his face one of grave sadness but also inner dignity He breathes
deeply and exhales

deck through the milling TOURISTS flanked by Marcel and Amy

ANDY
Theres only one thing certain in life- each of us owes
God a death

Proud determined Andy arrives at the six foot wire mesh fence and quickly
scales it Amy and Marcel follow Nearby tourists are alarmed and a clamor
of concern rises up Those with camcorders jockey for position

andy (contd)
All we can do is make sure its a good one

Andy gets over the fence and stands on the small ledge Amy and Marcel join
him The tourists gasp Andy glances down at THE PRECIPITOUS DROP He turns
suddenly pale

andy
Shit I feel sick

marcel

ADM
(Andy reacts to the
word church
Where is it Tell me Tell me or else

andy

gaston

Andy pulls backward as hard as he can jerking Gaston off balance Hes
trying to pull them both to their deaths but Gaston grabs a STEEL POST
with his free hand

Andy hangs below the ledge pulling Gastons arm down with all his new
superhuman strength But Gaston pulls back just as hard Andy sees The
STEEL POST start to bend He looks into Gastons FERAL STARE and
understands

andy
It was you You son-of-a-bitch You got my uncle

The POST keeps bending- its welds wont hold long
gaston

Andy stops pulling He looks uncertain- maybe Gaston is right But then-
SNAP The post which has bent all the way over into a J shape snaps its

Using the bent pole as a hook Gaston snares a HORIZONTAL ANTENNA which

he leaps for the window as Serafine fires BANG The bullet catches him in
the arm as he dives through the glass BANG She fires again and misses

Gaston lands in the courtyard three stories below and runs off with a
slight limp BANG BANG Serafine fires blindly into the courtyard after
him overwrought with anger Andy puts a hand to her arm and she lowers

crying Andy comforts her

Andy spins around to see Claude standing by the hallway to Terrences
office Andy reaches for the gun and points it at him

andy

serafine
Andy No

She puts herself between Claude and the gun barrel Andy pushes her out of
the way
andy
Serafine Move Dont you see hes just after the
drug that ADM stuff Hes using you to get to it just
like he used Uncle Terrence

Claude approaches Andy speaking calmly

claude
Youre exactly right Andy I enlisted both Serafine
and your uncle to obtain ADM And now Im counting on
your assistance too

andy
Why the fuck would I do that

serafine
Because Andy Its a cure

andy
A cure

claude
A cure With ADM we can wipe out lycanthropy the curse
of the werewolf forever

Andy is shocked stunned skeptical He bluffs with the only card hes got
andy
Is that so Maybe we should go to Saint Severin church

Claudes face changes Hes surprised
claude

INT SAINT SEVERIN CHURCH - EVENING

An evening mass is in progress The boys choir fills the church with a
solemn hymn Andy follows Claude to a narrow staircase An OLD WOMAN gives
them the evil eye and crosses herself as they pass Claude and Andy go up
the stairs and arrive at a balc ony under a magnificent wall of ancient
STAINED GLASS One of the panels catches Andys eye

andy
Whoa

THE PANEL shows a weird medieval ritual- a man draining blood from another
mans neck into a goblet ANOTHER PANEL features a pentagram ANOTHER PANEL
shows a huge werewolf eating a monk under a frowning sun All the
transcriptions are in Latin Claude signals Andy to follow him

claude
The panels that concern us are over here
(he directs Andy to a group of panels
Ill translate the Latin

A PANEL shows a different werewolf tied down being stabbed in the heart
by a knight under a frowning moon

claude
Then Simon did slay the demon spirit the same as had
made him unclean

THE NEXT PANEL- the knight now holds the beasts heart aloft impaled on
his dagger Where the beast was a man lies bleeding in the background
claude (contd)
and Simon did cut out the heart of the beast wh
once dead regained the shape of a man

THE NEXT PANEL shows the beasts heart on a platter The Hero is sitting at

a table cutting into the heart with a knife as if hes about to ea

CLAUDE (CONTD)

Simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was

cleansed
(he turns to Andy)

These pictures are not just myth Andy The scholars of

the day used them to record facts and enlighten

ich

the

public This is the medieval version of a newspaper

andy
(skeptical)
Yeah well what if its the Weekly World News

amy
No Its all true Andy

Startled Andy turns to see Amy and Marcel a little worse for wear
standing behind them

amy (contd)

I mean if by some miracle you can find the werewolf
that bit you and then manage to eat its heart the
curse is lifted I was gonna tell you but Marcel

wouldnt let me

marcel

Oh sure it was all mean old Marcels idea Give me
break We didnt tell you because its a wild goose

chase Not to mention disgusting Look

Marcel reaches into his own chest cavity rips out his own slimy purple

heart and thrusts it in Andys face

marcel (contd)
A little Grey Poupon and then Bon appetite eh

Andy grimaces and turns back to Claude

WhatOh right you can see these guys too

hand Claude frowns and discreetly wipes his hand with a handkerchief
Marcel smiles and extends his hand

Claude nods

rotting hand)

thank you Andys had enough

andy
Great Later on well have to get together for
cocktails Right now I kinda have to hurry before I
grow a lot of hair and eat people
(to Claude)
Say this heart thing works Whats it got to do with
ADM

claude
Its chemistry Andy Nothing more Mutated antigens
concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a
vaccine-like chain reaction in the infectee There were
not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century
but with todays technology its possi ble to
synthesize any chemical imaginable When I discovered
this ancient cure I knew who to go to

andy
Uncle Terrence

claude
Yes I was able to decode the old texts and give
Terrence the specifications It took a lot of trial and
error but finally he got it Adenine Di-Methyloxide
ADM I call it ADAM But just before he was attacked
he hid it

andy
Because Gaston was after it

claude
Yes that sociopath Hes given himself over to the
evil of lycanthropy To him ADAM is just a threat to
the terror he holds over others To us its salvation

marcel
Yeah well I dont know much about chemistry but even
if this stuff works you better find it by midnight
Otherwise its-

andy
Yeah I know Back to the Eiffel Tower

The lights are off Andy approaches Terrences oxygen tent In the dim
light he can barely make out Terrence through the plastic lying
motionless barely making an impression under the sheets He looks at the
body wistfully and surveys the array of m achinery thats keeping him
alive Most of the machines are plugged into a TRANSFORMER BOX on the
floor

andy
Hey We meet again Look I know you understand what
Im about to do here I think But I hope you forgive
me anyway

Andy takes a deep breath He leans down to the transformer and opens the
safety cover and flips the power switch All the machines power down

Suddenly the old man in the bed sits up gasping and clawing at the walls
of the oxygen tent Oh my God Its NOT Terrence Andy nearly soils
himself diving down to fumble with the transformer suddenly all thumbs
He switches the power on ag ain

support system Shes about to call for help when the indicator stops
flashing She watches it intently for a few seconds nothing She decides
to dismiss it

machinery is functioning normally again

With a sigh of relief Andy turns and pulls back the curtain behind him
Theres Terrence sans oxygen tent hooked up to another extensive support
system

andy
So You moved

He pulls the curtain closed behind him and moves in close to his uncle
Terrences expression looks unmistakably morose

andy
You dont look happy Um I dont usually go in for
this stuff but
(He crosses himself and says a silent
prayer)
Amen

Andy leans down opens the transformer box and flips the power switch The
machines power down- all except the EKG monitor which shows a flat line

and emits the familiar steady tone Andy switches off the monitor Silence

Terrences body is completely still peaceful He leans down over its face
and speaks in a soft voice

The door holds but for how long He looks at the old man in the oxygen
tent Hmm He pushes the old ma ns bed up against the door

Andy forces the window open and steps out onto the ledge He looks back
his uncle and the old guy He shrugs apologetically then takes a deep
breath closes his eyes and jumps

OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL ROOM DOOR

The fat nurse is getting impatient with the doctors who are attempting
pick the lock surgically She pushes them aside and heaves her
considerable heft against into the door It opens a crack She backs up
slams it again

INSIDE THE ROOM

The nurses jolts shake the old guys bed sliding it forward He dozes
happily like a baby rocking in the cradle

EXT THE BACK ALLEY BEHIND THE HOSPITAL

Andy runs behind a nearby dumpster to avoid being seen from the window
above He kicks the wall in frustration

Terrence mutters distractedly excitedly and quickly

TERRENCE

andy

BACK IN THE HOSPITAL ROOM
The doctors have clustered around Terrences corpse The nurse is
lubricating the electro-shock paddles for the doctor Serafine slips out

the door into the hallway

SOMEONES POV spying from behind a supply cart in the hallway (we see a
hand on the cart) watches Serafine walk away unnoticed by the doctors

BACK IN THE ALLEY

TERRENCE
Undead Right Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation

Andy turns towards Serafine then back to his uncle but Terrence is gone
INT HOSPITAL ROOM
Terrences face is contorted with pain The EKG monitor shows a weak but
regular heartbeat The doctor pulls off his mask and wipes his brow The
other technicians congratulate him

Andy looks around desperately A GUY pulls his motorcycle out of its
parking spot and starts up the street towards Andy Andy jumps out in front
of the accelerating bike and grabs the handlebars stopping it short
sending the rider tumbling forward o ver Andy He lands on his butt in the
street and starts yelling at Andy who climbs on the bike

andy
Sorry Ill bring it back

Serafine hops on the back and they burn rubber down the street after
Gaston Music cue CCRs Bad Moon on the Rise They screech around the
corner onto

SAINT GERMAIN BOULEVARD

Its red lights as far as the eye can see Andy grits his teeth and
accelerates towards the cluster of traffic stopped at the first light

serafine
Oh merde

She shuts her eyes as Andy zooms between the rows of stopped cars and roars
through the red light SCREECH Crossing cars slam on their brakes and
swerve to avoid the speeding bike Andy bears down on the next red light

serafine
Are you crazy

andy
Before Hemingway there was Starsky and Hutch

Andy speeds through more stopped cars and runs the next red light
SCREECH More swerving cars Andy has to swerve himself to avoid one He
bears down on the next light Meanwhile

She discreetly pockets her gun The COP in the passenger seat aims his gun
at Andy

to each other The second cop is apoplectic- about to explode

INT UNMARKED CAR

Rene and Francois speed off to keep pace with Andy Rene is dialing his
cellular phone As they pass the other police car we glimpse the two cops
in an angry shoving match against the car Renes call goes through

INT SAINT SEVERIN CHURCH

Leduc is on the balcony studying the stained glass panels and consulting
an old book The cellular phone in his coat pocket rings An OLD PRIEST
nearby frowns at him

leduc
(French- into phone)
Hello
(Pause)
Ill meet you there in ten minutes

He hangs up The priest is still frowning at him Leduc shrugs gruffly-
what do you want from me and turns back to the stained glass

As the church bells sound ten oclock we cut to different panels Several
scenes of werewolves terrorizing people A scene where some people mix
potions and dump a strange flower into a cauldron Another shows an evil
looking man shaking his arm defian tly at a frowning sun- though he is
human his raised arm is the enlarged hairy limb of a werewolf Another
shows a saint throwing the strange flower into a fire in the town square

leduc

(French)
Thank God for Saint Severin

The bells strike ten Leduc checks his watch closes his book and hurries
off

EXT TERRENCES APT BUILDING

runs into the court yard

ANDY AND SERAFINE

GASTON

riding the wire cage elevator in the apartment building down to the
basement He gets out and walks down the dank hallway past several
padlocked doors He stops at one with a MCDERMOTT nameplate Hes about to
shoot it off then looking around thinks again He grabs the lock and
grimacing with the effort twists it off with his bare hands

ANDY AND SERAFINE

stuck behind a garbage truck on a narrow street Andy hops the curb and
races down the sidewalk scattering pedestrians

GASTON

flicks on the light switch in the wine cellar There are six large racks of
wine bottles He walks past them scanning the bottles He stops at the
third rack and removes a bottle The label reads Chateau Margaux He
tries to peer inside but its to o hard to see Instead he hurls it at
the wall- SMASH Wine sprays everywhere but no metal cylinder He grabs
another bottle SMASH Just wine He grabs another

ANDY AND SERAFINE

arrive in front of the apartment and hop off their bike Serafine eyes
GASTONS BIKE hatefully Andy pulls her along

serafine
Wait a second

She pulls out her gun BLAM BLAM She blasts the gas tank- WOOF The bike
goes up in a fireball Serafine nods satisfied Andy looks at her like
shes nuts They rush into the courtyard

GASTON

throws another bottle SMASH Just wine The floor is awash in the pricey
Burgundy He throws another bottle SMASH Nothing He licks his fingers
Hes enjoying this

SERAFINE AND ANDY

In the elevator going down maddeningly slowly Through the window they
can see the full moon in the sky Andy checks his watch They look at each
other nervously

GASTON

Throws another- SMASH A small METAL CYLINDER clinks as it bounces on the
floor Gaston picks it up and smiles BANG A gunshot hits Gaston in the
arm- he drops the cylinder Serafine and Andy stand in the doorway

serafine
Dirty bastard

Serafine fires again- BANG The shot misses as Gaston hits the deck and
draws his gun in one very fast motion taking aim at Andy whos rushing
towards him

gaston
Thats far enough

Andy stops Gastons gun aimed at his chest Serafine steps slowly towards
Gaston her gun aimed at him

gaston
(to Serafine)
Another step and hes dead

andy
Go ahead Serafine Blow him away

Serafine stops The three of them stand there in a close triangle the
metal cylinder on the floor between them Its a Mexican standoff in
Paris Then

claude (0S)
Drop the gun

Claude is in the doorway holding a pistol Serafine sees him and turns back
to Gaston smiling

serafine
(to Gaston)
You heard him Do it

Gaston just smiles back at her Claude steps forwards and cocks his gun
against Serafines head

claude
I said drop the gun

Serafines expression turns confused horrified Andy is shocked She drops
the gun Claude picks it up and pockets it keeping his gun on Serafine
who stares at him aghast

andy
You bastard God I shouldve known You wanted the
cure all for yourself

gaston
Cure Ha-ha-ha

Andy and Serafine react with confusion to Gastons outburst Claude picks
up the metal cylinder and unscrews its cap with his free hand He slides
out a vial filled with amber fluid and holds it to up to the light He
smiles

claude
No its no cure Its something much more interesting

serafine

claude
(with mock alarm)
Oh did I hurt the little girls feelings Well excusez

CLAUDE (Contd)
I confess my desire for ADM is quite intense So I
deceived you and our poor friend Terry- a competent
technician but lets face it a bit naive The great
cure for lycanthropy Hmph He didnt have the vision
to grasp the potential of ADAM until it was too late
And even then he came rushing down to tell me as if I
would be just as shocked Ha

He pockets the vial pulls out the white cyanide tablet and pops it in
his mouth Andy reacts with shock

claude
(off Andys look crunching up tablet in his
mouth)
Oh this Rolaids I had a midnight snack that
disagreed with me
Serafines been doing a slow burn She explodes and lunges at Claude
knocking his gun out of his hand

serafine
Fucking traitor

She picks Claude up and hurls him across the room CRASH Claude smashes
into a rack of wine bottles Serafine jumps after him and dives on top of
him pummeling him in a blind rage Andy looks at her agog

andy
Wait a second

He and Gaston notice Claudes gun at the same time They both dive for it
Andy grabs it but Gaston steps on his hand and aims his gun down at him

gaston
You want to be cured

He cocks the gun Andy lets go of Claudes gun Gaston picks it up and aims
one gun at Andy and the other at Serafine whos wrestling with Claude
Claude throws her off and she lands on her butt next to Andy Andy looks at
Serafine

andy
What the fuck You too

serafine
(stammering)
I I didnt think you would Im sorry I
believed that son-of-a-bitch

Claude gets to his feet drenched with wine and smarting from Serafines
punches He walks over to Serafine and kicks her in the face

claude
Shut up you foul mouthed little cunt I dont have
time for your histrionics

gaston
Give me the ADM old man

Gaston is aiming one of his guns at Claude
claude

Oh for Christs sakes Gaston Cant you rise above the
level of common thug just this once

gaston
Give it to me
claude
Dont be an idiot There are certain procedures one
must—
gaston
Now

Claude sighs He takes the vial from his pocket and walks over to Gaston
claude
Very well then

Gaston grabs the vial uncaps it and drinks it down greedily He stands
there waiting Nothing happens

andy
Ha Some wonder drug

gaston
Why isnt it doing anything

claude
I told you Its not ready

Claude turns to the noise of footsteps and a walkie-talkie in the hallway
Four uniformed officers plus Rene and Francois storm into the room guns
drawn

Andy and Serafine put up their hands Gaston brandishes his guns at the

INT PADDY WAGON

Serafine hangs her head sullenly in a quiet rage She wont meet Andys
gaze He looks over at Claude and Gaston Gaston is restless edgy He

grabs Claude by the collar and shakes him

gaston
Nothings happening

andy
Looks like he lied to you too

Claude breaks Gastons grip and shoves him back in his seat
claude
(calmly)
Relax my friend Its still not ready
Andy looks back at Serafine He shakes his head in disbelief
andy

Now I remember why I didnt want to come to Paris
Everyone you meet is a goddam werewolf
Serafine stares bitterly at her feet

serafine
I hope they fucking fry us all

andy
Yeah French fries

SLAM Hes interrupted by the sound of Gastons head snapping back against
the wall His eyes bulge wide He grins and starts to laugh First a
little Then a lot

gaston
Yes Yes Ha Haha hahaha

He stands up laughing power-mad Suddenly his body is jerked by a spasm
and he falls to the floor Hes not laughing anymore He flails about
wildly croaking out strangled cries gripped with a terrible seizure

IN THE FRONT CAB

The TWO GUARDS the driver and his partner hear the commotion The guard
looks over to his partner and chuckles

partner
Aaooooo Heh heh heh

They both laugh The driver takes a sharp turn at high speed

IN THE BACK COMPARTMENT

Gaston flops around on the floor like a fish grabbed by a flurry of
convulsions He bites off his tongue spitting blood everywhere Finally

he goes rigid with one last seizure then falls totally limp Andy studies
the very dead corpse

andy
It killed him You coulda just used Draino Its
cheaper

claude

I told him it wasnt ready

Claude takes a folded PAPER CUP from his jacket pocket He blows into the
cup to bring it back into shape He then takes a SHARPENED STEEL TUBE from
his pocket plunges it into Gastons neck and fills the cup with the blood
that pours forth Andy and Serafine are horrified Claude puts the cup of
blood to his lips and pauses

claude
Now its ready

He swallows the cup of blood down in one gulp and sits back to wait for
the effects smiling dreamily

claude
What is the curse of the werewolf Ill tell you The
curse is to possess such awesome power and yet be
completely unconscious of it It may as well belong to
someone else But it wasnt always that way A thousand
years ago the Gauls had a drug powerful enough to
unlock the door to lycanthropic consciousness to full
control It came from moonsbreath

()

andy (contd)
A small white flower once found in the hills of this
region until the thick headed crusade by our famous
Saint Severin eradicated it for all eternity But now
thanks to ADAM the curse is over

As he says this he holds up his RIGHT ARM It begins to mutate and grow
reshaping his arm into the grotesque powerful forelimb of the beast
PLINK His swelling wrist pops the handcuff easily

serafine
(French)
Holy mother of God

andy
Fuck me

Claude rises to his feet triumphant He advances towards Andy and
Serafine backing them up against the rear doors of the van He gently
traces the outline of Serafines face with his werewolf hand She bristles
at his touch

claude
All my life Ive worked to unlock the power of the
unconscious mind Well this is it This is power

andy
You sure its not just coz you jerk off too much

Claude cocks his werewolf fist and SLAMS it into the back doors inches
from Andys head He leaves a deep dent and opens the doors just a crack
Its a gesture that seems calculated to frighten them It works

Claude holds up his LEFT ARM and transforms it to match his right It takes
some effort and a little pain but he keeps a smile on his face throughout
the process

claude
Dont you see what this means Ive broken through Im
in total control Not the moon I can do whatever the
fuck I want

SMASH Claude drives his left arm into the back doors making another huge
dent and opening the crack even wider

IN THE FRONT CAB
The cops exchange worried looks The one on the passenger side slides open
the viewing panel Claude has his back to him

cop
(French)
Hey Whats going on in--

He stops short as Claude turns around revealing his monstrous arms
Mortified the cop reaches for the SHOT GUN under the dash Claude races up
towards the view window As the guard pokes the muzzle through the window
Claude grabs hold of it BLAM T he guards shot hits the side wall Claude
rips the gun from the guard angrily and smashes it to pieces against the
wall grinning like the devil himself

Meanwhile ANDY throws himself at the doors kicking them trying in vain to
break them open He spots the SHOTGUN BARREL on the floor and grabs it

CLAUDE reaches through the window and grabs the guard by the head He
repeatedly smashes the guards head against the back wall of the cab

claude
(as he smashes the guard)
Dont you know the wolf is a protected

species

The driver freaks out seeing his partner get his head crushed THE PADDY
WAGON swerves all over the road

ANDY uses the shotgun barrel to twist open the lock on the van doors As
the vehicle swerves he drops the barrel out the door and falls over He
calls to Serafine

andy
I need your help Come on

She joins him and together they take a run at the back doors The doors
open a little but the lock still holds

Finished with the guard Claude turns and sees what Andy and Serafine are
up to

CLAUDE
Wait

Andy and Serafine take another run- it works THE DOORS bust open and Andy
and Serafine still handcuffed go tumbling out into THE STREET rolling on
the pavement

SCREECH HONK Cars swerve to avoid them just barely CRASH A minivan
plows into a parked car Claude watches from the back of the van He rears
his head to the moon and smiles

IN THE CAB of the paddy wagon the driver hears an unearthly howl Its
hellish Without looking away from the road he points his pistol through
the hole in the compartment He adjusts THE MIRROR to see into the rear
compartment - The back doors are hanging open He steals a look over his
shoulder- Other than Gastons corpse its empty He breathes a sigh of
relief and turns back to the road as-

A HUGE WEREWOLF - Claude fully transformed - bursts through the windshield
and rips into him

THE PADDY WAGON is traveling over the Pont Neuf bridge A GASOLINE TRUCK
approaches from the other direction The werewolf leaps off of the hood
just as the paddy wagon swerving all over the road hits the gasoline
truck head on

KA-BOOM Both vehicles explode in a fireball smash through the side wall
of the bridge and plunge into THE RIVER

expressions The party is in full swing- throbbing beats and sweaty dancing
bodies They walk straight across the dance floor pushing their way
through the crowd Amongst the variety o f freaky types here no one raises
an eyebrow at two people in handcuffs

Serafine whos scanning the room is approached by a leather clad HIPSTER
GUY

HIPSTER GUY
Serafine mon belle Ca va

He goes to kiss her on both cheeks Without breaking stride she puts her
handcuffed hands on his face and shoves sending him reeling

Serafine points out a gang of four militant skinheads off in a corner Andy
nods and smiles

andy
This could be fun

They make their way to the skinheads Andy walks up to the SKINHEAD LEADER
whos got a swastika tattoo a bad disposition and a fifty pound advantage
on Andy

I got something you want Follow me

Andy and Serafine walk into A SMALL CHAMBER off the main space The
skinhead signals his mates to come along slips on some BRASS KNUCKLES and
follows Andy into

THE CHAMBER

The skinheads surround Andy and Serafine Theres no one else in the room
The skinhead leader looks at Andys handcuffs and sniggers

skinhead
What do you got pervert

ANDY
I got Hitlers dick in a jar And the funny thing is
its still in Goerrings mouth

The skinhead turns red with rage and throws a punch at Andys head With
lightning speed Andy grabs the skinheads fist twists his arm around his
back and hurls him across the room He slams face first into the stone wall
and collapses on the floor w ith a THUD

Simultaneously the other three skinheads attack Serafine BASHES one
across the face with both fists sending him to the floor The other gets
her in a headlock from behind She runs backwards and- SLAM- crushes him
against the wall

The third skinhead tries to kick Andy in the groin Andy grabs his boot and
flips him over backwards- he actually does a full back flip and lands on
his face

The leader groggily pulls a pistol and aims it at Andy Andy snatches it
out of his hand

The hand moves a bit pulls back and disappears into the crossing passage

ANDy
Hes alive Cmon

They hurry down to the landing shine their light into the passage The
hand is severed and A BIG RAT is dragging it along with some difficulty A
dozen or other rats munch on scraps of flesh scattered over a grisly mess
of blood and body parts Andy and Serafine stare at it for a moment
Suddenly Andy looks away

andy
God I cant believe it

serafine
What

andy
(disturbed)
Its making me hungry

A beast HOWL echoes through the tunnels Serafine shines he flashlight on
some bloody beast footpaw prints leading down the stairs

They follow the bloody prints down the stairs and come to an ancient ARCHED
DOORWAY with a skull set in the arch and a chiseled inscription Andy
points to the inscription

andy
What does it say

serafine
(reading)
Stop Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris
the exclusive domain of the dead

Andy gestures back to the bloody remains

andy
Well say were with him

They walk through the gate and enter
THE CATACOMBS

Andy shines his flashlight around illuminating two large tunnels which
lead into a twisting intestinal maze lined from floor to ceiling with
HUMAN SKULLS and FEMURS The bones form the building blocks of the tunnel
walls and are arranged in various patterns- from crucifixes to Masonic
pyramids and even pentagrams Ground water seeps from the ceilings and
walls DRIPPING over the eroded crumbling bones

Despite the situation Andy cant help but be dumb struck by the
spectacular necropolis

ANDY
Whoa

serafine
After the revolution the Paris cemeteries overflowed
They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here
Seven million people Mostly very poor

andy
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers

serafine
Well they are French

andy
Right

Another eerie HOWL echoes through the maze Andy looks down both main
tunnels- the howl seems to come from each of them

ANDY
These tunnels must loop around and connect

serafine
Lets go from both ends Well cut him off

Andy considers this
andy
Okay Be careful

serafine
You too

She kisses him Theyre both sweating heavily now She starts off to the
right He watches her go for a moment and then walks down the other skull
lined tunnel

EXT PETIT PONT - NIGHT

The CHARRED BODIES of Gaston and the two cops lie on the river bank near
the wreck Leduc surveys them with a few other cops Napier leans out of a
nearby car with a radio handset The bells of nearby Notre Dame begin to
ring

Napier
(French)
Its headquarters sir They got a report

Leduc rushes over and grabs the handset

LEDUC
(French- into radio)
Whatve you got

desk officer (V0O)
Just a crazy call from a girl probably fucked up on
drugs I wouldnt bother you but you said call with
anything unusual

LEDUC
What did she say

desk officer (V0O)
Something about a monster underground in the
catacombs under Place Denfert

LEDUC
I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert
immediately You can tell the commissioner its a code
red

DESK OFFICER (v0O)
But Inspector this girl I wouldnt call her reliable

LEDUC
Now

desk officer (V0O)
Yes sir
Leduc throws the handset back at Napier The church bells strike twelve

INT CATACOMBS

Andy walks along carefully shining the flashlight ahead of him his gun at
the ready His breathing gets heavier His face gets redder More sweat
His heart pounds in his ears

The tunnel follows a serpentine path with many smaller passages and
anterooms off to the sides

Andy sees some flickering light reflecting off the wet skulls up ahead He
approaches it Its coming out of AN ANTECHAMBER He holds his gun out in
front of him and steps quietly He peers into the antechamber and finds

TWO HALF EATEN BODIES

Its the old hag and the wino he saw in the tunnels at the first party
Theyve been killed very recently- blood still drips from their gaping
wounds

He kneels over the winos body Theres a big chunk missing from his neck
Andy stares at the BLOODY FLESH transfixed He shudders with a sudden
spasm His breathing gets quicker More sweat He reaches towards the
wound his hand shaking and touches the flesh Blood runs down his
fingers He slowly brings his hand back towards his mouth

TERRENCE (0S)
Dont do it Andy Fight it with everything youve got

Andy looks up to see UNCLE TERRENCE stumps and all sitting across from
him

andy
Uncle Terrence youre

TERRENCE
Yeah I finally checked out thank God But theres a
bit of unfinished business

andy
Claude

TERRENCE
I never thought Id ask this of anyone Andy but do me
a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch will you
A SNARL cuts him off Andy jumps up steps out into the main tunnel and
shines his light

THE BEAST
rounds a curve and comes into view about thirty yards away Its running
straight at Andy and closing fast Andy aims the gun BANG A miss- the
bullet shatters a skull on the wall BANG Another miss BANG The bullet
hits the beast in the shoulder I t stumbles but keeps coming BANG A
miss Andy aims carefully

ANDY
Cmon you mother

BANG A direct hit in the chest The beast falls Snarling in pain

BANG Andy blasts again but the beast drags itself to the safety of a
recessed area off the tunnel out of Andys line of fire Andy walks
forward listening to the horrible wails of the beast thrashing around in
a puddle on the floor

Andy aims his gun and his flashlight as he nears the corner of the recess
The wailing and thrashing settles down Andy proceeds cautiously He rounds
the corner and shines the light on

SERAFINE

naked bleeding from bullet wounds in the chest shoulder and neck She
lies still Andy sighs with anguish He drops to his knees

andy
No Oh God

He puts down his gun and cradles her head in his hands Shes breathing-
just barely She looks into his eyes Her voice is weak

ANDY
Oh God Shit

serafine
Andy

She reaches up feebly and manages to grab the SWITCHBLADE from his back
pocket She clicks it open and hands it to Andy

serafine
Do it

Andys shaking shuddering- his breathing erratic

andy
No Its over

He shakily presses the gun to his own head

TERRENCE (0S)
Dont Andy Stop Claude

Andy looks up Terrence Marcel Amy and a dozen other mutilated rotting
undead presumably Serafines victims stand in the tunnel looking on
solemnly

marcel (os)
Either way works for us

amy
But you better hurry

Claudes stentorian voice echos from beyond a curve in the tunnel

claude (0S)
You cant turn back Andy

CLAUDE

in human form walks towards the glow from Andys flashlight around the
bend His naked body is taut and muscular- it looks thirty years younger
than it should His face is younger too- he looks the picture of a powerful
young warrior

claude
Man is something to be surpassed A rope stretched
over the abyss between the animal and the Superman
Neitzche was right Andy And now I have crossed that
abyss I am no longer man OR beast but man AND beast
ADAM has lived up to its name I am the first new man
and my God it is FUCKING MAGNIFICENT Youre already
half way there Andy Feel the power in your veins With
ADAM you could harness it Master it Let it transform
you into something more glorious than your wildest
dreams

ANDY

is shaking violently- on the brink of transforming Serafine raises the
blade to him again Shes fading fast

serafine
Dont let me die for nothing

Andy winces with pain- his brow bulges his teeth enlarge the
transformation is starting Uncle Terrence is worried

TERRENCE
Andy

CLAUDE

still walking The light is getting brighter- hes almost around the bend
Hes buzzing with a scary kind of euphoria

claude
The choice is yours Andy deny your own blood die an
unfulfilled child or face the challenge of mind and
body united at last Which will it be

He rounds the corner and sees Andy hunched over Serafines body He keeps
walking

claude (contd)
Dont be confused by old beliefs This is beyond mere
words like good or evil You have to feel it

ANDY

whips around BLOOD streaming from his mouth gun aimed grip rock solid
his features back to normal eyes locked on the beast with determined
controlled rage

andy
Feel this

BLAM BLAM He pumps out two shots One hits Claude in the upper left part
of his CHEST The other hits his CHEEK exits at the back of his jaw and
shatters the cheekbone of A SKULL on the wall behind him He screams in
pain and dives for cover into a SMALL INTERSECTING TUNNEL

Andy gets up pausing for a second to look back at Serafines face It
looks peaceful The undead are gone He starts after Claude

CLAUDE

sits leaning against a wall of skulls The face wound is bleeding but not
mortal

claude
Stupid boy

With an awesome rage he grimaces and starts to TRANSFORM HIS LEFT SIDE- his
muscles swell around the chest wound and THE BULLET actually squeezes out
of the hole and falls to the ground The wound closes up as the flesh keeps
morphing and growing hair

ANDY

creeps around the corner gun and flashlight aimed towards the small
tunnel

When the flashlight beam falls on Claude hes in mid pounce- rocketing at
Andy with bad intent BANG Andy gets off a shot- it hits Claude in his
THIGH as he tackles Andy

They wrestle Claude in mid-transformation his left side further along
hairier his facial bones shifting His thigh swells and ripples and THE
BULLET SQUIRTS OUT of its wound

His left arm mostly transformed grips Andys gun hand BANG Andy
squeezes off a shot blowing off the tip of Claudes transforming THUMB

CRUNCH Claude clamps his vice like grip and crushes the gun Andy wrenches
his hand away as Claude hurls him off like a rag doll

Andy flies through the air and SMASHES into the tunnel wall The wall of
ancient SKULLS and BONES shatters and collapses around Andy- burying him in
ossified fragments

Andy lifts himself out of the pile and looks at Claude who lies on the
floor finishing his transformation His right side is catching up with his
left and his head is now more beast than human All the while he glares at
Andy and doesnt appear vulner able

Andy takes advantage of the moment to get the hell away- he runs into the
tunnel leaving Claude behind to finish transforming

Andy makes a few quick turns through the maze- it seems he has evaded
Claude for the moment He pulls the GRENADE from his pocket turns off his
flashlight and pads along softly listening for the beast

Suddenly a sharp sound from behind him makes Andy jump

VOICE
(French- screaming)
STOP WHERE YOU ARE HANDS UP

Andy turns around A scared COP is aiming his gun at him shining a
flashlight in his face Andy puts his hands up

COP
(English)
Its you You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin
and Racine

andy
Shhh Be quiet man Were not alone-

cop
Shut up Save your stories The only thing I want to
hear is you begging for your life I want to see you
suffer like they did

(he sees Andys look of terror)
Haha Youre scared now eh Come on Wheres the scary
monster now huh Ha ha Well see who-

A ROAR cuts him off The cop spins around- the beam from his flashlight
flooding THE BEAST with light as it springs through the air at him Andy
runs
cop
(French)
My God
He gets off one shot- it hits the beast in the arm but its too late The
beast clamps its massive jaw onto the cops neck and bites his head clean
off THE HEAD rolls across the floor and comes to rest in a pile of skulls

In the tunnel Two queasy cops stand over it Leduc approaches them

ANDY

is crouched at a corner of two catacomb tunnels grenade clutched in his
hand He hears something and carefully peers around the corner

ANDYS POV

At the end of the long tunnel of bones the beast lurks at another
intersection sniffing the air and growling some forty yards away

Andy ducks back around the corner He holds up the grenade pulls the pin
and whispers a quick prayer

andy
(to himself)
Just throw a strike

With a determined grunt he pitches the grenade around the corner and then
ducks back Suddenly the beasts growling stops Andy grits his teeth and
closes his eyes awaiting the explosion Just silence Then a small
skittering sound close by He opens his eyes

THE GRENADE

skitters to a stop a couple of feet from him

andy
Shit

He bolts and gets five steps from it when
KA-BOOM It explodes behind him launching him through the air along with

a spray of bones and rubble He lands twenty feet away and clutches his
left leg wincing in pain
ANDY
Ahh Son of a bitch

LEDUC
and the cops turn towards the sound of the blast
LEDUC
(French)
Lets go

ANDY

struggles to his feet He clicks on his flashlight and sees the blast has
caved in the tunnel- a wall of rubble seals Andy off from the beast

Andy breaths a sigh of relief At least hes got time He starts limping
away from the wall of rubble

SMASH The rubble explodes again as the beast crashes through it like a
freight train sending rocks and bones flying

Andy runs as fast as he can with his bad leg The beast closes in on him
quickly Andy jumps up for a NARROW OPENING in the tunnel ceiling He grabs
the metal rung inside and pulls himself up into the vertical shaft as the
beast pounces The beast catc hes Andys foot with its claw Andy pulls out
of his sneaker and just barely eludes the beasts grasp

Andy climbs up the metal rungs in this old service shaft- barely wide
enough for his body The beast claws and gnashes his teeth at the opening
but cant fit in- for now

Andy reaches an iron grate pushes it up and crawls out into

ANOTHER DRIPPY TUNNEL

Like the ones near the party- no skulls Theres a lot of water in this
one It looks familiar

CLAUDE
is transforming back into human shape His face is now more human than
beast He screams into the vertical passage in a growling not quite human

voice

claude
You have no advantage Andy My body has no limits

ANDY

looks around in the tunnel He sees something (we dont) He limps off
towards it

CLAUDE

in his human shape crawls into the vertical service passage and climbs up
the rungs
Claude emerges from the shaft into the dark tunnel Andys no where in
sight We hear only dripping water

claude
So this is how you choose to die Hiding like a scared
rabbit Just praying I dont find you
ANDY

crouches under a concrete ledge in a very dark space Claudes voice sounds
distant echoey and competes with the closer sound of trickling water

CLAUDE (contd- OS)
Well I assure you your nervous sweat glands will give
you away soon enough my trembling little rabbit

CLAUDE

begins transforming He falls to the ground and groans with joyous pain as
his body noisily transforms

CLAUDE (Contd)
AHHHH ITS FUCKING GLORIOUS AAAARRGGGHHH

ANDY
huddles in his hiding place looking out into the darkness

andy
(to himself)
Cmon already
A glint of light appears in a puddle on the ground Andys eyes widen
CLAUDE

His head is transforming- his exaltations become more animalistic

claudebeast
RRAAAAAARRRRRRGGG

LEDUC

still in the catacombs hears Claudes yell echo through the tunnels He
thinks it came from above He runs towards a stairway

THE BEAST

Claude is fully transformed He sniffs the air locks in on a scent and
sets off through the tunnel

ANDY

watches intently as the light in the puddle gets brighter It starts
reflecting on the wet concrete walls of this tunnel
andy
(to himself)
Now

Andy clicks on the flashlight shines it at himself and yells for all hes
worth

andy
HEY YOU DIRTY EVIL FUCK CMON AND GET ME I DARE YOUR
UGLY ASS (etc)
THE BEAST

cocks its head towards Andys taunts The sound of flowing water is
closeby The beast pounces towards Andys voice into

THE WET SLIPPERY STAIRWAY

that Andy slid down that first night in the tunnels The beast loses its
footing and slips helplessly down the slick eroded stone GROWLING
furiously

LEDUC

runs down a tunnel towards Andys screaming voice The beam of his
flashlight illuminates the landing ahead of him halfway down the
stairwell He sees THE BEAST slide by clawing in vain for a grip

A METRO TRAIN

screams around the bend lighting up the whole metro tunnel Andy is still
SCREAMING from his refuge under a ledge

THE BEAST
shoots out of the stairwell and lands on the tracks It looks up frozen
for a split second- its horrible snarling face is caught in the speeding

trains harsh glare

SMASH Impact The beast is sucked under the wheels and ground to bits
between track and wheels

LEDUC

at the landing looks down the stairwell as the train rushes past
ANDY

huddled next to the passing train clenches his fist in victory

andy
Yes

The train passes Andy gets up and shines his flashlight around the ground
The beasts body lies in chunks smears and puddles The parts begin
morphing back into Claudes human forms- A THIGH here A PIECE OF SPINE
there
LEDUC inches his way down the last few feet of the stairway using the
rusty pipe for a handhold He walks up with his flashlight and aims it at
the BEASTS HEAD which finishes turning back into Claudes head

Leduc glances at Andy He takes a small envelope from his pocket and shakes
out a single SILVER BULLET He loads it into his gun and FIRES straight
into Claudes lifeless head

LEDUC
(to Andy)
I always wanted to do that I saw it in a movie

andy
What about me

LEDUC
My men think you died and floated away in the Seine If
I wanted to I could let them believe that
(a long pause)
But that would be illegal

Andy looks at him carefully trying to read him Leducs face is impassive

INT COURTROOM NIGHT

The prosecutor who speaks English with a thick French accent has an
extremely sarcastic look on his face He wheels around dramatically and
confronts Andy who sits uneasily on the stand wiping the sweat from his
brow

prosecutor
You intend us to believe that you committed these
murders because the moon was full and you were somehow
magically transformed into a huge powerful beast with
an insatiable appetite for human flesh is that right

andy
You dont understand

The prosecutor turns away towards the jury to mock Andy

prosecutor
Oh So I dont understand You think its me who has a
hard time coming to grips with reality

The JURORS snigger at Andys expense But wait suddenly they look
concerned- somethings wrong The prosecutor continues his back to Andy
prosecutor (contd)
You think Im the one who needs my head examined I
dont understand Well Mr McDermott enlighten me
He wheels around to Andy and comes face to face with
THE BEAST
huge and ravenous It goes for his throat

prosecutor
Good God Aaaaaaaa

The beast tears the prosecutor apart spraying blood everywhere The jury -
oddly enough - break into polite applause One less lawyer

INT AIRPLANE - NIGHT

Andy wakes up with a start- a concerned STEWARDESS is leaning over him
Disturbed PASSENGERS crane their necks peering at him like hes nuts

stewardess
You were screaming in your sleep sir Are you okay

Andy looks around getting his bearings He takes a deep breath and shakes
it off

andy
Yeah It was just um something I ate

The stewardess nods and smiles a little uneasily He picks up the Bloody
Mary from his table and gulps some down A little bit of tomato juice
dribbles down his chin He looks out the window

EXT AIRPLANE

It flies along over a blanket of clouds past the huge silver moon The
song is Cat Stevens Moonshadow sardonically covered by Nirvana with

the oh so appropriate lyrics If I ever lose my legs
