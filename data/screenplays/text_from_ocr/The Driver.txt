THE DRIVER

Lives alone

THE DETECTIVE

Lives alone

Chauffeured getaways for 12 years Fifteen years a cop

Best Wheelman in the city
Works off the street
Never asks a question

-Always wears a dark suit

And never wears a tie

Best arrest record in the city
Works off the street

Asks a lot of questions
Always wears a dark suit
Always wears a tie

THE PLAYER

Lives alone

Doesnt own anything

Doesnt like to answer questions
But does like to take a chance
She almost makes a living at it
Wears dark colors

Treats everyone like a stranger
