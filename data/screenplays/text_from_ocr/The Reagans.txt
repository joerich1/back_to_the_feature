knows him Running Reagan will cost half
what it would cost to run somebody that
nobedy’s ever heard of

REAGAN
Shoot

Ron switches on a tape-recorder The reel begins to turn

RON
So Dad I mean Governor Reagan As you
prepare to leave office what do you think
is the biggest achievement of your
administration

REAGAN
Are you speaking as a reporter or as my
son

RON
Dad Come on It’s the school paper

REAGAN
Okay lets seeWell I know people hate
to hear thisbut the state of California
has finally been forced to become fiscally
responsiblewhich meant that like it or
not we had to end the free lunch that a
lot of our citizens had come to expect

RON
Yeah but you closed down two-thirds of
the state mental hospitals and all those
people ended up on the street
(off Reagan’s look of surprise)
Dad I’m not stupid

REAGAN
(smiles)
No you’re not But I have much more faith
in the resilience of the American people
than you do They always pull themselves
up by their own bootstraps

RON
But you raised taxes more than any other
Governor in United States history I mean
you’re a Republican you’re supposed to be
against raising taxes

REAGAN
Well I’ve got a theory about economics
If the rich have more money to spend on
buying things and building businesses it
will naturally end up helping the poor
people It’s called “trickle-down”

Pause Ron is turning cautious

RON
You want to run for President again don’t
you

REAGAN

Now RonYou know me better than that
Reagan laughs Ron doesn’t He’s worried

RON
What if you turn into another Richard
Nixon

Reagan is surprised Silent for several moments

oe REAGAN

Listen Ron I go to bed at night with the

knowledge that I’ve done my best to see

and hope that these peoplethat I’ve

directly appointedmeet the standards that

I want them to meet But there can be
someonewhile I’m sleepingdoing something
he shouldnt do and it will break over my
head oe

Silence as Ron tries to figure this one out

i

RON
So are you saying you are or you aren’t
going to run for President in ‘76

Reagan’s eyes twinkle as he answers

REAGAN
Ron I tell you from the bottom of my
heartI have utterly and absolutely no
ambitions to be President in 1976

Mr President Mrs Ford

Someone asked me to write a letter for a
time capsule that is going to be opened in
Los Angeles a hundred years from now on
our Tricentennial They suggested I write
something about the problems and issues of
the day

ANGLE - Gerry Ford realizing that his own speech has become
nothing but a warm-up speech for Reagans

REAGAN
We live in a world in which the great
powers have poised and aimed at each other
horrible missiles of destruction nuclear
weapons that can in a matter of minutes
destroy virtually the civilized world we
live in

THE CONVENTION FLOOR - Under every red white and blue
straw hat is a face transfixed

REAGAN
And suddenly it dawned on me those who
read this letter a hundred years from now
will know whether those missiles were
fired Will they look back with
appreciation and say “Thank God for those
people in 1976 who headed off that loss of

scat”

eae
freedom who kept our world from nuclear
destruction

‘By now many faces across the floor are wet with tears -

BILL SHELBY
Your love of the land is obvious But
President Carter says your environmental
policy would turn land like yours over to
the polluters

REAGAN
If hell check the facts hell find that
more pollution is caused by rotting
vegetation than by any so-called
polluters—his name for big business by
the way

BILL SHELBY
By “rotting vegetation” sir do you mean
trees

JOHN TOWER

Mr Presidentas head of the Presidential
Commission to investigate Iran-ContraI’m
here to tell you our findings One year
ago you personally approved the sale of
antitank missiles to Iran for the purpose
of exchanging arms for hostages You knew
that Iran was on the United States’ list
of terrorist nations and you knew that
Congress had enacted an embargo against
Iran Nevertheless you defied the United
States Congress and you defied the law

Reagan’s left hand twitches Tower sees it but continues

JOHN TOWER
The money from the arms sales38 million
dollarswas channeled through a covert
network of dummy corporations4 million
was diverted to the Nicaraguan Contras Of
the remaining 34 million a majority wound
up in private pockets In conclusion Mr
President the action that you ordered has
not only destroyed this country’s foreign
policyit turned us into the laughing-
stock of the Middle East and the world

in the doorway terrified

as the Antichrist He too will fall and
then Jesus Christ will triumph in the
creation of a new heaven and a new earth

concerned that he will be forced to reveal
the names of other CIA agents in the area

prisoner exchange—we give them one of
their terrorists in return for Buckley—

SHULTZ
No No prisoner exchange This
administration does not negotiate with
terrorists

BAKER
But the Iranians want stuff from us They
want weapons anything for their war on
Iraq—

SHULTZ
No Iran is a terrorist nation We do not
negotiate with terrorist nations

But if Buckley gives them the names of
other CIA agents were all screwed—

SHULTZ
You negotiate over Buckley you know what
will happen We’ll get more kidnappings

open up communication with the kidnappers—

talking—

I think both of us have been aware every
minute we’re herethat we’re surrounded by
you by others who may not be here today
and it couldn’t have been done without
you And I like to think maybe it’s kind
of close to what happened 200 years agoWe
were all revolutionaries and the
revolution has been a successbut there
just aren’t anyaren’t enough words to
thank you for all that you’ve meant to us
and how hard it is to say goodbyeto all
of you The only thing that makes it
bearable at all is to remember all that
you did and howhow much of a team we did
become Thank youand God bless you all
