Burn the words

“Therefore the Lord God banished Adam and Eve from the
Garden of Eden and placed a flaming sword to protect
the tree of life”

The words become the

NIGHT SKY

Our beginning The whole universe above Life eternal

And there in the middle of it all a gold star Brighter
and larger than the rest It flickers violently hinting at
distant chaos

FROM THE GROUND

Crickets scream their mating calls A thunderous noise

Until the insects go silent Eerie

A muddy foot in a worn sandal smashes down

REVEAL FATHER AVILA a Franciscan priest his chest heaving

His possessed and feverish eyes scan the blackness around
him He looks up at the sky

November 2003 2

Terrified silence
A deep voice rises from the dark woods

MANS VOICE (0S)
Have no fear father

Avila is relieved He breathes again

Enter CAPTAIN TOMAS CREO a beast of a man He pulls his
cracked helmet from his head and drops it in the mud His
face is lined weathered weary A meaty scar zigzags
through his natty beard

FATHER AVILA
Captain

A xag tag Spanish army pushes itself into the clearing behind

Tomas The handful of men are in disarray Half of the men
are being carried or supported by those still standing

Soldiers pull arrows out of their cotton armor The horses
are limping The injured cry out for help

Tomas steps next to the priest

TOMAS
Tell me we are no longer lost You
know where it is

Father Avila lowers his head in defeat He does not know
which way to go

A temporary setback for Tomas The conquistador scans the
darkness He spots a rise in the clearing-

He turns to his second in command a hulking half-crazed
Moor

TOMAS
(points)
The rise Form ranks

But CAPTAIN ARIEL does not respond He looks down at his
huge bloody hands

TOMAS
What are you doing

A handful of soldiers step up behind Ariel They back the
bulky Moor‘s mutiny None of the men have the courage to
look at Tomas
November 2003

ARIEL
We think we should return to the
ships

TOMAS

Retreat Never

ARIEL
I’m sorry -

Ariel eases his blade from its scabbard

TOMAS
Fools

Every soldier watches the action The priest tries to
intervene

FATHER AVILA
No no stop this

Tomas acts In a flash a dagger is in his hand

In a second flash Tomas drives the blade into Ariel’s
throat

The fight is over before it began
Ariel lands on his back dead

TOMAS
Coward

Tomas looks at the other mutinous soldiers
He pulls his sword

TOMAS
The choice is yours Die now
or - by my side - fight for life
They nod to him Tomas puts his blade away

TOMAS
Captain Rivera

A skinny thin-lipped soldier steps up
TOMAS
The rise

Form ranks

CAPTAIN RIVERA turns to the men
November 2003 4

RIVERA
Ranks

TOMAS
Three sides

RIVERA
Three SIDES

The army groups in a triangular formation on top of the hill
fen men on each side The injured are placed in the middle
with the horses for protection

TOMAS
We shall face them here

Tomas and Rivera take position on top of a boulder in the
center of the rise The army is terrified Shaking

RIVERA
Like phantoms Gone
Where did they go
TOMAS
They taunt us Preparing
their feast
Rivera barks commands to the men He keeps them alert

Tomas pulls something from his breast pocket
It is a simple gold ring

He brings it up to his face and inhales its scent

His eyes close His mind focuses on the smell

The breath takes him for a-moment back to the motherland
SEVILLE SPAIN

It is three years earlier

Tomas stands before a woman ISABEL She’s young and
beautiful her skin so fair it almost glows

The sun is rising Golden light floods the heavens
He can‘t look at her

From the necklace around her neck she removes the gold ring
Gently she places it into his calloused paim

Only his heartbeat for a moment He holds back a tear

Now back in the
November 2003 5

SWAMP

Tomas puts the ring away A fresh breath of courage floods
his lungs

Father Avila is slumped against the boulder holding his face
in defeat

TOMAS
Priest point us in‘a direction or
die alongside these noble Christian
souls The heathens are upon us
with a desperate thirst for blood
The priest rises to his feet nodding

FATHER AVILA
Yes Yes We must -—

fomas silences him by holding up his hand
The forest is silent Completely still
Beat

Tomas spots a single leaf move
It is enough to cue the great warrior

TOMAS
Shields

The Spanish kneel and raise their shields forming a giant
umbrella

Just then the arrows pour in
The downpour is as thick as locusts A thunderous rain

From beneath the canopy Tomas howls encouragement

TOMAS
Hold Everyone hold

Captain Rivera slips off the rock
Moss is knocked free Something is under the moss

A carving

Father Avila strips the moss off the rock revealing a
design

His eyes light up He scans the swamp looking for the final
piece in the puzzle
November 2003 6

ae The arrows keep coming A few slip through the defenses
One soldier catches a stone arrowhead in his neck Blood
flings free as he falls back Another catches one in the
chest A third in his open mouth

But then the arrows stop
Silence except for the injured soldiers’ moans

TOMAS
Hold ranks

RIVERA
Everyone hold

FATHER AVILA
Captain Look We are here

Tomas peels his eyes away to look at the ceremonial stone
beneath his feet

There is a triangular glyph carved onto the rock

FATHER AVILA
Shibalba

Father Avila pulls out an ancient Mayan obsidian dagger
There is a triangular glyph carved onto the blade
It is the same design as on the stone and in the sky

The priest gives the blade to the warrior Tomas raises the
blade to the heavens

The glyph on the blade lines up perfectly with the triangular
constellation surrounding the gold star

The shape formed by the stars on the carved rock and on the
Mayan blade are all one and the same

A sparkle of possibility twinkles in Tomas’ eyes
TOMAS
Then our fate is revealed
Glory is our destiny
RIVERA
Men victory is in our grasp

A sign

Rivera points at the stone For a moment the Spaniards’
fear relieved

Tomas scans the swamp He peers deep into the darkness
November 2003 7

TOMAS
And where is this pyramid

FATHER AVILA
Here Close

TOMAS
Which direction -

BOOM

Suddenly there is the sound of a great drum It is a noise
so evil it raises the hairs on the back of Tomas’ neck

TOMAS
First we fight Then their
treasure will be ours
BOOM
The Spaniards start to get scared The horses get restless
BOOM
Again

Tomas slides the Mayan dagger into his belt He hands Father
Avila a real blade

TOMAS
Even a priest shall kill today

Tomas pulls out his rapier
BOOM
And the invisible army cries out It’s a shrill and painful
noise Now more drums All different types Noises
everywhere
The Spanish are panicking Tomas screams above them
TOMAS
We ride with Spain’s banner
It bears her majesty’s blessing
And through it we shall live
forever VICTORY OR DEATH
His men respond with three cries of their own

They are answered with silence Complete silence

Beat
November 2003 8

TOMAS
Crossbows

And then the great Mayan army bursts into the clearing
Brandishing weapons war paint feathered plumes sinister
masks Screaming with passion and fury They are an
overwhelming terrifying sight It is an ocean of men and
they aren’t taking any prisoners

Tomas‘ men look out in horror This is the end
Tomas doesn‘t even blink It‘s not his time
Not yet

He yells over the noise and the fear with absolute
conviction

TOMAS
The Lord Christ and at them

The Spaniards fire their loaded crossbows The front row of
Mayans tumble into the ground But the enemy army keeps
coming They trample their own men

In a blink of an eye they pour themselves onto the Spanish

Tomas slides out a second blade

He attacks Tomas stabs and lunges
But the enemy is everywhere

The ranks break
It’s chaos

RIVERA
Fall back

The Spanish fall back into the nearby
FOREST

But the trees do little to protect them
The soldiers are falling quickly

Father Avila stabs a bloody Mayan But it doesn’t do much
Countless hands grab the priest

They pull on him until he literally splits apart
The priest dies with the Lord’s name upon his lips

Rivera slices and dices But he too is soon overwhelmed
AR dagger is shoved into his back He gurgles on his own
blood as he dies
November 2003 9

Tomas continues to fall back
He never stops fighting His sword swings killing scores
He refuses to surrender

He is the lone Spaniard living His army is decimated
But still he keeps attacking

TOMAS

Ishall not die Not here

Not now NEVER
The Mayan army surges at him
He trips loses his footing Stumbles backwards
Momentum carries him Falling
still fighting Swinging his sword Screaming
He lands on his back His head hits
THUD

SMASH TO

CLOSE ON TOM CREO

Eyes pop open Waking with a start Fear still grips him
He‘s the same man as Tomas His face just as weary

But now the beard is gone And so is the scar
His hair is a thin silver crew cut and his eyebrows are gray

fom takes a deep breath Calming himself down He is alive
It was all just a dream That same bad dream

He’s ina

BLACK SPACE

Silence

Toms floating in the lotus position amongst the branches of an
ANCIENT TREE

Old and big as time Its giant roots crisscrossing forming
a nest around the bottom curve of the interior of a

SPACE SHIP

A perfect sphere Shooting through space
November 2003 10

He‘s a man in a bubble and
The year is 2150 and
He looks up out the front of the ship
TOM
(whispers to himself)
Were almost there
CUT TO
DEEP SPACE

Smothered with stars They sparkle forever in the ink black
infinity

One grows in size Approaching

In fact it is not a star It is the spherical ship heading
right toward us

WHOCOOOOSH
The bubble whips by Faster than anything we’ve ever seen
Quickly it disappears racing toward a towering nebula
The nebula is a great glowing cloud made of trillions upon
trillions of molecules It shimmers like a gold silk sheet
catching a light summer breeze
It almost looks like heaven

RETURN TO
THE SHIP
Tom tilts backwards
He floats down to the ground Gravity weighs on him again
His knees buckle as he staggers to the tree
The tree
It seems to quiver as he nears
He runs his eyes across the scarred and barren surface

The tree is dying If not dead already
November 2003 ll

Only a small worn crevice in the trunk seems to still be
alive

Tom drops to his knees He reaches out to the healthy bark

Tiny hairs on the bark reach out towards him Static
electricity

Right before he touches it he stops
He senses something someone

A WOMAN is watching him
He doesn’t look at her and we don‘t see her ‘face

He ignores her He turns his back on her
He places an affectionate hand on the tree

Tom leans close to the healthy bark His lips almost kiss
the golden hairs

TOM
(whispers)
Don’t worry We will be all right
Were close Very close

He pats the tree gently He moves to a pond of water
He rinses his face waking up

That woman is still looking at him He tries to ignore her

But her unseen eyes feel as if theyre burrowing into his
skull He can’t take it anymore He looks over

She is breathtaking Her name is I2ZZI and she looks just
like Isabel except shes wearing a winter jacket and jeans

TOM
(angry )
What

She doesn‘t answer She just smiles

Tom knows what hes supposed to say but he can‘t seem to say
it

He takes a breath He subdues his anger He looks back up
at Izzi but this time he is surprised to see her

TOM
What are you doing here
November 2003 12

Her voice is cheerful and filled with life

IZZI
Come on let’s take a walk

And now it is the year 2004 and Tom is sitting in
A 20TH CENTURY OFFICE
TOM
(playing a part)

I have too much work

IZ2ZI
It’s the first snow We always--

And now Tom is gone Instead sitting behind a desk in front
of a computer is TOMMY He is a present day version of Tom
and Tomas in a button down shirt and slacks

TOMMY
I can’t I have so much to do

Come on Tommy

— TOMMY
a bit too loud)
PLEASE I2zi

Izzi lowers her chin

TOMMY
I‘m sorry I am

Izzi nods as she leaves
The memory fades away and we return to the

GARDEN

Tommy is gone as well Tom with silver hair stares into
black space Even though Izzi is gone he says

- TOM
I‘ll see you tonight OK

But no one is there to answer His eyes well up with tears
He looks down at his hands
Beat

FADE TO
November 2003 13

THE GARDEN - LATER
Tom picks different herbs and fungi from the ailing plants
surrounding the tree Some things he eats Other stuff he
stores in small piles

FADE TO
BOW OF SHIP — LATER

Tom concentrates as his body moves through an ancient Tai Chi
series His movements graceful and poised

The sphere pushes into the great nebula like a plane entering
a cloud bank

Everything disappears into a glow of golden light

FADE TO
GARDEN — LATER
Tom sits near the tree -- alone
His right sleeve is gone His right arm revealed
It is covered with tattoos Wrapped like bracelets Each
ring unique Some thick some thin Elaborate designs

elegant lines

With the stone flint he works on a new ring on his right
shoulder

But something distracts him He looks over

- In the garden is a hospital bed On the bed lies TIzzi
‘She is not well

Tom looks away He tries to focus on the tattoo

But he can’t help himself He gets up and walks over to
Tazi

As he arrives at her bedside he returns to 2004 as Tommy
I242ZIS HOSPITAL ROOM

Tommy eases himself down onto the bed next to her She is
holding a leather bound manuscript

I22Zr
I want you to help me
November 2003 14
TOMMY
How

IZ2Z1I
Ne Finish it

Tommy doesnt understand

I2ZZ1
Finish it

TOMMY
I don’t know how it ends

IZZI
You do You will

Anger builds inside Tommy

He stands up crushing the memory
Returning to 2150 as Tom in the
GARDEN

He screams

TOM
No
NS But no one is there to hear him
He is once again -- alone
TOM

(quietly now)
No I can‘t Not again

He raises his shirt Beneath his heart is a freshly healed
wound He touches it tenderly

Tom crouches down Deep in thought Holding his brow
He starts to tattoo his shoulder again
But once again he senses something He senses someone

Izzi is watching him But not from the bed She’s standing
smiling at him She’s wearing the winter jacket and jeans

TOM
NL Please Leave me alone
Youre killing us Why
November 2003 15

But she just smiles Waiting Waiting for the memory to
start

He follows the tattoos down his right arm

Each tattoo is a year of his life Each year a different
memory Each ring fading away like the pigment in his skin

He pulls up his left sleeve

Tattoos cover this arm too They are lighter than the right
arm’s rings Older

He follows them down to the first tattoo This initial
tattoo is crudely drawn around the ring finger in the same
place a wedding band would be worn
A memory slips through his mind
He decides to give in to Izzi
He will play his part
TOM
All right I trust you
Take me Show me

He takes a deep breath surrendering
He looks up at Izzi but this time he is surprised

TOM
What are you doing here

Izzi answers

IZZI
Come on lets take a walk

The memory returns him to 2004 in his

OFFICE

Once again Tommy sits behind his desk

Izzi wipes some melting snow flakes off her jacket

TOM
I have too much work

IZZI -
Its the first snow We always-

TOMMY
I can’t I have so much to do
November 2003 16

IZ2ZI
Come on Tommy

TOMMY
PLEASE Izzi

Izzi lowers her chin’as she leaves

TOMMY
I‘ll see you tonight OK

She doesn‘t answer
Tommy sits alone with his work-covered desk

Finally even he can’t stand himself
He gets up and chases after her

In the
HALLWAY - SILVER-HANDEL LABORATORIES
He bumps into MANNY a stubble headed geek out of breath

MANNY
Antonio‘s on his way back

Tommy watches Izzi head out the door at the end of the
hallway

MANNY
Donovan’s still prepped and ready

He can choose his wife or his work
Beat

TOMMY
Damn it

He makes a decision Work

A new determination floods his soul

He turns away from his wife and races up the hallway
Manny follows

TOMMY
Does Henry have new scans

Tommy pushes through swinging doors into the
SCRUB ROOM

HENRY a lab technician from Taiwan is ready for him
November 2003 17

He holds up the scans in front of an x-ray light

HENRY
- The growth continues to expand

Tommy removes his-wedding ring and places it above the soap
dish while he scrubs

Henry helps Tommy into his gown and gloves

TOMMY
(screams )
Wheres Antonio

Tommy in full surgical gear rushes into the
OPERATING ROOM
which is filled with cutting edge medical gadgets

BETTY a career lab technician in scrubs monitors the vital
statistics

BETTY
Hes been ready for fifty minutes
now

Tommy nods any exhaustion long gone Hes God in this room
Manny bursts in

MANNY
Hes crossing the street

TOMMY

BETTY
(to Tommy
surprised)
- You dont know

MANNY
(ignores Betty answers
Tommy )

Manny hurries out of the room
November 2003 18

Tommy looks down at his patient

TOMMY

ANTONIO a muscular but soft spoken post-doc chemist enters
Tommy looks at him expectantly

Beat
ANTONIO
(shakes his head calm)
No good Great specificity But no
suppression
Tommys face falls with disappointment
Beat Beat
BETTY
(softly)
Should we close him

HENRY
Well have to euthanize

BETTY
Why

Tommy shakes his head to himself No No No No
HENRY
If we dont treat him now we wont
have another chance before the
growth gets him
Tommy just pushes past them back into the
SCRUB ROOM

Starts pacing back and forth Getting angrier and angrier
He will not be stopped He will not fail

He will not

His whole team watches him Tommy avoids their eyes
crouches in a corner

Theres a nasty winter storm blowing down on the skylight
The wind causes the glass panes to rattle
November 2003 13

Tommy lets out a frustrated sigh

The other scientists glance nervously at each other Theyve
never seen him without an answer

Beat

He looks up through the water-streaked skylight Snow
collides with the rattling glass panes

The sounds around him begin to fade and disappear

A spark of golden light shoots off the skylight Tommy
doesnt know what it was

In a moment it is completely silent Now there‘’s another
spark And another The glass starts to light up with
golden rays of light

And for a moment Tommy is Tom sitting in the

GARDEN

His eyes filled with wonder

Miniscule particles from the nebula collide with the front of
the ship causing giant burning sparks of golden light

Outside in
SPACE

The bubble soars through the nebula Shards of light dance
magically across the surface of the ship

Back in the
SCRUB ROOM
Inspiration explodes in Tommy‘s eyes

A smile slowly spreads across the scientist’s face The
smile of discovery

BETTY
I‘1l prepare the pentobarbital

TOMMY
No wait

Manny grins he knows Tommys got something

Tommy looks down from the skylight at his team
November 2003 20

compound we played around with last

excited)

Tommy nods his head

Manny rushes out of the freezer with a glass vial

MANNY
Is this it

Tommy grabs the vial from Manny Checks it out And hands

it to Antonio

TOMMY

Antonio hustles over to the chemistry area of the lab

Betty looks like shes about to have a heart attack

Antonio and Tommy stand over the patient wearing masks and
lightly stained gowns Betty operates the anesthesia

TOMMY
- Give me 15 ccs

Antonio sticks a needle into the open vial that Manny holds
and carefully draws up some liquid

He hands the syringe to Tommy who snaps it into a mechanical
stereotaxic arm mounted in the surgical field

Tommy starts to slowly turn a small metal wheel

Then he hits a‘button Electronically it depresses the
plunger on the syringe

As the chemical enters the patients brain we MOVE OVER

ROOF
The sky is filled with stars The air is freezing cold
He eases next to her She grabs his hand

IZZI
Go on Look -

He puts his eye on the eye piece
TOMMYS POV

Focusing in on the pulsing gold star Its the same star
Fathér Avila eyed at the start of the story the same star
Tom is heading for in the future Its all one in the same

TOMMY
The gold star

IZZi
It‘s actually a nebula wrapped
around a dying star That’s what
makes it look gold

Tommy pulls his eye away He makes a show that he’s
impressed by her knowledge She sees his expression

She smiles

IZ21I

He doesn’t like the topic of conversation

IZ2I
Some day it will explode die and
give birth to new stars Death

She looks down

TOMMY
(alarm)
Where are your shoes

He‘s serious this time

For a moment she seems to he Surprised

He looks away and

But

She shrugs as she squishes her toes in the slush as if it

were mud
November 2003 30

He smiles and shakes his head at her

TOMMY
Lets warm you up

CUT TO
SPACE
The year 2150 The bubble ship pushes through the nebula
FADE TO INSIDE
THE SHIP
Tom floats through the branches of the tree

He massages water into the stem of a leaf
It is one of the few leaves on the tree

He blows gently onto the leaf

Tom takes hold of a massive branch
He feels it massages it

His hands caress the old dying wood

Toms hands dissolve into Tommy’s hands in 2004 The tree
branches become Izzi‘s frail limbs

FADE BACK TO
BATHROOM — PRESENT DAY

Tommy washes Izzis body with a sponge Shes naked in a
large antique tub Her hair is just growing in

Hes kneeling by her side sleeves rolled up
Shes enjoying his attention Then she notices something
Her devilish smile creeps across her face

IzZ21

TOMMY

IZZI
Joking

TOMMY

He moves to get up She stops him
IZZ1I
Wait The sponge
Would you heat it

Tommy looks back Something is wrong His eyes narrow

The water in the bath is hot Steam creeps over the lip of
the tub

He can tell shes trying to tell him something
Tommy turns on the tap He places the sponge under the hot
water until his hand is red from the heat He keeps it there

for another moment

“He carefully touches the steaming sponge against her thigh
He looks into her face

Tears gather in her eyes as she shakes her head no

November 2003 33

Her frustration mounts Instead of crying she grabs for him

She kisses him

He kisses her back But she’s sick He gets concerned
Pulls away

But Izzi kisses him harder Much harder
He cant resist The passion grows He kisses her hard
Mouths open Surrendering
And he slips into the bath Fully clothed Hes soaked

Serious now she kisses him lightly He kisses her
Slowly they make love

Izzi wrapped in a white robe tries to hand him a leather
bound manuscript

Tommy holds up a finger motioning for her to wait Someone

He hangs up and looks down at the manuscript

TOMMY

On the cover it says “The Fountain” And it is written by
Isabel Creo

TOMMY

I2Z2Z1

Izzi knows what he’s going to do She heads downstairs

FREEWAY — NIGHT

Two points of light emerge from the darkness

forward Only car on the road

Tommy’s car whips by fast Heading towards a city

Modern skyscrapers reaching high glowing gold in the winter

cold Speeding towards civilization

His taillights disappear

BETTY

HENRY

(jumps in excited)
Were seeing an increase in neural
activity and synaptic growth
throughout all the areas usually
stunted by normal aging

Tommys amazed He cant believe it He cant believe what
he did What this means He touches Donovans fingertips
Its impossible to believe that its the same monkey

Donovan jumps around the fountain of youth surging through
his body

Tommy laughs he cant help himself cant help but get
caught up in the joy of the moment

Then he remembers Reality comes flooding back
Tommy turns to his team

TOMMY
- And the tumor’

BETTY
No change

Tommy closes his eyes The disappointment nearly killing
him

BETTY
The growth has normal patterns
theres no positive or negative
effect on it

His shoulders sag The weight returns

HENRY
This is still major

BETTY
We should tell Dr Guzetti Shes gonna have to

HENRY
(mutters to himself)
- Again
TOMMY
(snaps)
So Who do you - Were close

Damn close If you don’t want to
work here - that’s the door

They all hurry off leaving Tommy behind with Donovan
The monkeys all worked up from Tommys outburst
Swinging back and forth in his cage

CUT TO
TOMMY and IZZIS BEDROOM — DAWN
Tommy stands in the doorway of his bedroom and stares at his
wife in their bed Shes asleep On her side Hugging a
pillow So peaceful
A new day is dawning outside

She’s so beautiful He holds back the tears

Creeps into bed Spoons her from behind He rubs his nose
against the soft hairs on the back of her neck

She moans blissfully

The sun breaks the horizon Tommy and Izzi are flooded ina
gentle morning glow

She turns to him

IZZI
Is everything all right

Tommy kisses Izzi on the lips and nestles into her back
November 2003 39

TOMMY
Yes everythings all right

She closes her eyes Drifts quickly into her dreams
He tries to join her But he can’t

The tears rush up He fights to swallow them Tries not to
shake her

The sobs battle with control
He sits up in bed and heads into his

HOME OFFICE

Slumped in his chair Tommy holds his face He has no idea

what to do

I22i’s manuscript sits on his keyboard
Its presence calms him

He flips on the desk lamp and stares at the title

Tommy opens to the first page and starts to read
TOMMYS POV

Drifting over the words

“A shadow hung over Spain The Grand Inquisitor tightened
his bony fingers into two fists Frustration twisted his
sweaty thin lips He cleared his throat of phlegm as he
marched“

And the words start to break apart

The letters start to dissolve into dirty shadows

An amorphous shape moves through darkness

two ancient hands swing into the torch light

The fingers crack as they tighten into shaking fists

A ring with the emblem of the Dominican Order

We are nowhere near Izzis bedside

In fact we have left present day and

The year is 1532 and

Its three years before the Mayan temple siege and we’re in
the motherland

SEVILLE SPAIN
Shuffling through a cold dark
PASSAGEWAY

We follow the bony frame of a hunched man His lungs gasp
for oxygen through a whistling deviated septum

This is SILECIO the Grand Inquisitor himself Heis the
leader of the Dominican Order Gaunt and sunken-eyed the
Holy Father is a skeleton of a man

He steps out onto a high rostrum overlooking the

ROYAL SQUARE NIGHT

A great fire rages in the center of a cobblestone plaza
Twelve wooden stakes surround the flames

PRISONERS are bound to the poles

They have been stripped and beaten

The nobles monks and nuns - settled in comfortable seats
beneath the rostrum look up at Silecio

Silence Everyone waits Silecio surveys his domain
A shrill voice bursts out of his chapped lips
SILECIO
Repent and ye shall go to heaven
Deny your sins and ye shall go to
hell
The prisoners cry out They confess screaming for mercy
Silecio holds up his hand The prisoners hold their tongues
SILECIO
Ask not for mercy For death is
certain Ask for forgiveness and
then eternity in heaven can surely
be yours
The prisoners cry out in fear There is no escape
SMASH TO
SEVILLE CITY LIMITS — SAME

A white horse shoots out of the darkness Tomas gallops
along a wooden bridge
November 2003 41

He is joined by five mounted soldiers They show their
horses no mercy charging towards the golden barn fire in the
distance

RETURN TO

ROYAL PLAZA — SAME

A TERRIFIED PRISONER stares into the darkness His tear-—
filled eyes beg for a savior

Up on the rostrum a highly-decorated Dominican MONK hands
Silecio an official document

Silecio opens the scroll- He digests its contents
Then he clears his throat

SILECIO

You the accused who say scandalous
things against our holy Catholic
Faith and against the officials of
the Inquisition who affirm that
life is but birth and death and
that there is no paradise and no
hell

The prisoners cry out for mercy On a nearby

BLUFF

On foot now Tomas tells his men to lower their heads They
spy down on the proceedings

Tomas loads a crossbow Two other soldiers do the same
The rest silently pull out their rapiers

Tomas lines up Silecio in his sight

SILECIO
I hereby decree that upon such
rebels be all the plagues and
maledictions which befell and
descended on King Pharoah Let
them perish in flames and be
swallowed up into the earth for the
great delinquencies and sins which
they committed in disobedience and
rebellion against our Lord God
Accursed
be they in living and dying

(MORE )
November 2003 42
SILECIO (contd)
Accursed be they to Satan and to
Lucifer and to all the devils in
hell

The conquistador’s finger firms its grip on the trigger
Ready to shoot Beat

A pebble is kicked across dirt Footsteps approach
Tomas lowers the crossbow Locks eyes with his men

They all take cover against a nearby boulder
As the intruder rounds the corner Tomas’ men ambush him

They smash him against the boulder Tomas’ dagger is already
against his jugular

But the enemy is Captain Ariel the mutinous Moor we last saw
die on the end of Tomas’ dagger He is alive and well He
wears regal clothes and carries the insignia of the Queen

Tomas lowers his blade His men release him
Ariel is on their side

Ariel whispers to Tomas

ARIEL
You dare betray Spain‘s wishes

TOMAS

The Holy Father grows ‘more

malignant with each passing day

This latest claim of heresy Her

majesty’s closest allies

Nonsense The Inquisitor is trying

to isolate her To kill her He

must be stopped before all Spain is

his
Tomas peeks over the bluff Silecio rolls up the scroll He
hands it back to a monk The prisoners moan in fear

ARIEL
I agree But you are ill prepared
His force will overwhelm you
Suicide is foolish

TOMAS
At least we will die fighting

Silecio nods to twelve monks holding torches The Dominicans
approach the prisoners

Tomas moves to attack But Ariel grabs him once more
November 2003 43

ARIEL
Stop The Queen has a plan A
clever design Her majesty
commands your presence She
demands it

Tomas hears Ariel‘s request He looks back at the twelve men
going up in flames Their screams are horrid

ARIEL
Now

Tomas sheaths his blade He follows Ariel back towards their
horses

CUT TO

VANITY ROOM
A sagging OLD LADY stares at herself ina mirror

Her gray skin is scarred with wrinkles Her eyes are cloudy
with blue cataracts Her teeth are stained yellow

REVERSE onto Isabel The old lady is clearly a reflection of
her imagination

Because Isabel the Queen of Spain is the same women we saw
at the start of the film She is young and beautiful But
apparently her self-image is not strong

When she lifts her arm the old lady lifts hers Isabel’s
skin is smooth like silk The old lady’s skin is riddled
with knotty veins

‘Igabel is disgusted

Her anger explodes She picks up the nearest thing a
perfume bottle and hurls it at her reflection

The mirror shatters into golden shards in

Particles smash into the bubble ship as it shoots through the
nebula The light show becomes

PRIVATE CATHEDRAL

He is devout His focus and prayer is complete

Beat
Ariel places a hand on Tomas’ shoulder Tomas looks up

ARIEL
Spain is ready

Tomas rises He pushes through two great doors ‘into the
THRONE ROOM

It is a stark puritan room with little decoration
Except for the Queen

Isabel glows gold like the inside of the nebula
Her gown flickers with blinding light

Tomas looks away immediately The majesty his fear her
glory it is all too much for him

He approaches her Ariel follows a few steps behind
Tomas kneels before her And he cries

QUEEN ISABEL
My servant why do you cry

Tomas tries to stop his tears He cannot

TOMAS
To see Spain in such a state With
a disease growing in her very
heart It is too much For I have
failed her

QUEEN ISABEL
Silence

Dare not pity Spain Spain is
great And greatness shall never
fall My glory shall shine bright

Tommy turns off the alarm clock The bed is made
Izzi is gone

Tommy catches sight of a note on the end table
He picks it up and reads it

CUT TO
NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM - MORNING
Tommy rushes through a pre-Columbian art exhibit searching
for his wife He passes by a guard and slows to a fast

walk Moving past illustrated Mayan books codices all lit
up and on display
November 2003 46

Tommy spots Izzi staring at one of the books She looks
better Its a good day

TOMMY
- what are you doing here

She looks up and smiles at him
IZZI

- hey You fell asleep at your
desk Are you ok

TOMMY
Fine -

Tommy wants to tell her she should be resting
She spins away and looks into a display case

IZZ1I

Mayan books These are the rare
ones the Spanish didn‘t burn Look
at this one

She point to a codex An image of a TREE BURSTING OUT OF A
MANS STOMACH on an ancient scroll

IZZ1
The man is First Father the Mayan
Adam Coming out of his stomach is
the Tree of Life

TOMMY
Is he dead

IZZI
He sacrificed himself to make the
world

She turns around and hugs her husband Her hands dance over
his ticklish body as she talks

IZZI
The tree‘s roots spread out and
made the earth and its branches
formed the sky

Tommys ticklish and even though he loves it he cringes

I2Z21
First Fathers children cut off his
head and stuck it on top of a pole

She lunges for his head

He turns back to the book
First Father‘’s face is painted with pain

TOMMY

(on the book
That’s gotta hurt

Tomas senses something Spins around

He sees immediately something is wrong

November 2003 48

Across the room Izzi reaches out grabbing for something
anything to brace herself

We move in on Izzis eyes Her look of concern suddenly
melts away

A glimmer of light reflects off her eyes
A distant star She grins slightly

Tommy sees this He sees the look in her eyes
It bewilders him
But then he sees her threatening to fall He runs to her

She knocks over the rope barrier It CLANGS loudly to the
floor The guard approaches as the school children stare

And then she starts to fall She slips into emptiness
She lets go
Tommy pushes through the students
He grabs her Holds her
but it is a moment too late

TOMMY
For now

DR LIPPER
The growth is on the advance Its
strangling the medulla Thats
what caused her insensitivity to
temperature

Dr Lipper hands Tommy some MRIs Tommy whips them up to the

light studying them closely

DR LIPPER
- Its only a matter of time until
the swelling overcomes her

Bang

The words hit Tommy like a gunshot He doesnt give in
There has to be a solution

TOMMY
Surgery

DR LIPPER
(shakes his head)
You know its too deep

Tommys not listening studying the MRIs

TOMMY
- What about chemo

DR LIPPER
I thought she decided--

TOMMY
(turns to him)
Will it give her more time

DR LIPPER
Shes terminal Tommy You know

- All decisions Through me

CITY STREET - NIGHT

Tommy crosses the street moving fast Always in a rush
His mind a million miles away Deep in thought Its just
him Numb He doesnt hear or see anything

Suddenly a car screeches to a halt just missing Tommy by a
few inches

The noise of downtown rushes in as Tommy is jolted from his
cocoon Tommy blinks Turns and rushes away

He just keeps moving forward

She chases after him He lights a cigarette Sucking it
down

LILLIAN
- What are you doing No one

Youre not being rational Tommy
You cant fix everything -

Everybodys watching them

HOSPITAL AFTERNOON
Tommy runs down the hall toward
I2ZZIS ROOM

The doors open He peeks inside sees Lillian sitting with
Izzi holding her hand They dont notice Tommy at the door

An old healthy woman stares into the eyes of a young dying
woman They are both open completely open

Izzi has seen something Lilly can just barely sense

Lilly strains to understand with her brain Nonetheless
with her heart she can feel Izzi’s peace

Izzi is thankful She is understood The calmness fills
them both

Their love soars through the room Tommy takes a step back
into the hall The moments moved him

He turns to go back and runs smack into Lillian leaving
The door closing shut behind her

An awkward moment

Tommy sneaks a peek through the door window Sees his wife
sleeping
He looks back at Lillian Hes in so much pain anguish
LILLIAN

Okay

TOMMY
Thanks Just for a few hours

She puts a hand on his shoulder

LILLIAN
— Take your time

Tommy enters

Izzi nods her head her devilish smile peeks through her

sickness Tommy looks at her

TOMMY

Tommy grabs the present and pulls off the wrapping

Inside a silk box is a beautiful fountain pen and a crystal

Izzi stares at Tom Her eyes reaching through time
Pleading He nods He understands her request

Tom gets up from the bed He is emotionally moved

He lifts up his shirt He looks at the freshly healed wound
just beneath his heart He pets it gently

TOM
(remembering)
You do You will
Izzi and her bed are gone Tom is all alone

He reaches out to the healthy bark on the trunk A few of
the hairs reach back It is weaker now

He makes a decision

TOM
OK I’11 try-

He collects some herbs and fungi from the dying garden
He mixes them on the surface of an indented rock He places
- the rock next to the tree

fom sits beneath the wilted branches He takes a deep
breath closes his eyes and allowsa dream to invade his

mind

A small breeze ripples his clothes as his mind opens up
Literally The ancient stones of the Mayan temple rush out
of his cranium and flood the garden and deep space

In a moment he looks down at his feet and realizes he’s
wearing armor

And now hes no longer Tom He is in fact
The great conquistador Captain Tomas Creo
It is the year 1535 and Tomas struggles for his life in a
‘CENTRAL AMERICAN FOREST
His men have been massacred He is fighting his last stand
TOMAS
I shall not die -Not here
Not now NEVER
But the Mayans are too fierce They are too numerous

Once again they surge forward

He trips Loses his footing
November 2003 61

Stumbling backwards Momentum takes him
SCREAMING

Slowly falling through air he lands hard

THUD

His eyes shudder He almost loses consciousness

He fights to stay awake He keeps fighting He keeps
swinging

But no one is attacking him He is alone

He looks back at his enemy A huge Mayan force stares at him
quietly They stand five feet from him but they don’t dare
attack

They don’t dare take a step Between them and Tomas is a
gateway lined with fresh skulls

He has fallen onto sacred ground For the moment he is safe
Behind him are steps Steep steps

Hovering above Tomas is a great

MAYAN PYRAMID

It stretches ten stories high

A glow of firelight radiates from the mount

The enemy army kneels

Their heads bowed

Their weapons lowered

Tomas does not understand

He hears someone moving down the stone steps

Walking down from the mount is the Mayan spiritual leader
the PAPAS He wears a frightening headdress made of skulls
covered with fresh human skin His long hair is knotted with
caked blood and pieces of pink flesh

He carries a flaming obsidian sword

Tomas struggles to his feet

He breaks off the arrows sticking into his armor
caiaas

November 2003 62

The Papas arrives at the bottom of the stairs
Tomas reaches for his own sword It is gone

He pulls out his only weapon Father Avila‘’s Mayan dagger
It will have to do
The Papas stares at his prey with bloodshot eyes
PAPAS
(in Mayan with
subtitles)
First Father sacrificed himself to
the tree of life Enter and join
his fate

Tomas doesn‘t understand The Papas knows this He smiles
His teeth are filed to vampire points

Tomas attacks The Papas sidesteps and counters

The flaming sword splits the air Instantly the point lands
firmly in Tomas’ chest

His shirt catches fire

The front of it burns away revealing a nasty gash just
beneath the conquistador‘s heart

He stumbles backwards holding the wound

For the first time we see fear grip Tomas Death is close
His eyes race His breath quickens

He is going to die
Victoriously the Mayan moves in for the kill
PAPAS
(in Mayan with
subtitles)
Death is the road to awe

The Papas lifts the flaming blade and
Tomas shrinks back and
The blade rushes toward the crown of his head
And as it hits

SMASH TO
November 2003 63

CLOSE ON TOM CREO
Eyes pop open

TOM
Noooooo

He is back in the
GARDEN
Shooting through space Alone

He takes a breath The nightmare again But something is
wrong

He looks down at his shirt It’s sticky and wet

It‘s blood His blood Gently he raises his shirt

Theres a cut just beneath his heart in the same exact place
the Mayan stabbed Tomas with the flaming sword The same

spot that had just healed

It is painful He carefully moves to a small pond Each
step hurts

He rinses the wound It is deep Theres a lot of blood

IZZI (0S8)
Finish it

Tom looks up Izzi calls from her hospital bed in the
garden

Tom presses down on the wound

TOM
I cant

IZZI
Finish it

Tom shows her his wound

TOM
I don‘t know how

Tom tries to hold back the tears but can’t

IZ2ZI
Finish it
November 2003 64

TOM
Stop it

IZZ1
Finish it

TOM

It’s KILLING me

And he jams his eyes shut screaming himself back into the
past

IZZI’S HOSPITAL ROOM
Tommy sits by Izzi’s side He is calm now

IZ2Z1T
You do You will

Beat

TOMMY
I don’t know how it ends

IZZ1
You do You will

Tommy feels uncomfortable

TOMMY
Honey —

Izzi smiles Like she knows a secret

IZ21
Remember Moses Morales

TOMMY
who

IZZ1
The Mayan shaman

TOMMY
(remembering)
From your trip

IZZI
(nods)
The last night I was with him he
told me about his father He had
died But Moses wouldn’t believe
it
November 2003

TOMMY
(pleads
Izzi -

IZ21

Listen He said if they dug his
father’s body up it would be gone
They had planted a seed over his
grave The seed became a tree
Moses said his father became part
of that tree He grew into the
wood and into the bloom Then he
said when a sparrow ate the trees
fruit his father flew with the
birds And when a hunter ate the
sparrow his father lived on in that
man

(making the point)
He said death was his fathers
road to awe Thats what he called
it The road to awe

(about her manuscript)
When I wrote this I couldnt get
that out of my head —

TOMMY
Why are you telling me this

I2Z1
(quiet)
Im not afraid anymore Tommy
Tommy just shakes his head
1221
I asked Lilly if I could be buried

at her farm

Tommy gets up off the bed

TOMMY
No Stop it I want you to be
with me

IT am with you Iam I‘1l always
be with you

She reaches out her hand

IZ2ZI
I promise

November 2003 66

Tommy takes her hand He tries to hold it all in

He struggles to stay strong
She stares at him Beat
He nervously glances at his watch She smiles at his
predictability
IZ21
Stay with me
Tommys desire for the lab his drive to make things right
pulls on him
Izzi starts to shut her eyes
IZ2I
(encouraging plea)
While I sleep
Izzi slowly falls asleep as Tommy holds her hand
She shuts her eyes
TOMMY e
I’1l stay
In the
GARDEN
In 2150 Tom- watches Izzi’‘s hand disappear from his own
TOM
I‘ll stay
- e
But Izzi is gone Tom is alone
He looks down at his open wound It is still bleeding
Tom shuffles to the tree The small hairs on the healthy
bark reach out towards him
TOM
(whispers to the tree)
Don‘t worry Weare almost there
Shibalba will die And when it
explodes you will be reborn You
will bloom We will live
Carefully like a surgeon he removes a small amount of bark
Se A very small amount
November 2003 67

He mixes it with herbs and fungi He adds some saliva
fhen he applies the mixture to a piece of dried up moss

He pushes the moss against his wound It burns
But then it brings relief

He leans against the tree He slowly shuts his eyes
FADE TO BLACK

IZZI’S HOSPITAL ROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

Its dark when Tommy wakes I2zi sleeps soundly

Her breaths are deep and long Even more at peace

He looks at his watch Its almost dawn

Carefully he tiptoes into the hallway

HOSPITAL PHONE — HALLWAY - LATER

Tommys on the phone Talking quietly

TOMMY (INTO PHONE)

Will you check him again

LILLIAN (OS PHONE)
Of course

Tommy hangs up stares at the phone for a moment then sneaks
back into

IZZIS ROOM

He looks at his wife’s luminous face

God shes beautiful glowing in the early dawn light
He reaches out to touch her face

His fingers stop a few inches from contact

Decides not to disturb her

Tommy sits in the chair next to her bed and accidentally sits
on the notebook

He picks up the manuscript and quietly flips on a bedside
lamp

He opens to where he left off
TOMMYS POV
Drifting over the words

“The conquistador prayed He prayed for Spain He prayed
for his Queen”

The letters start to sparkle and flair

And the golden particles of
November 2003 69

SPACE

Return us to

SEVILLE

‘Tomas Verde kneels praying to the golden crucifix hanging in a
PRIVATE CATHEDRAL

Ariel disturbs him

ARTEL
She is ready

Tomas rises He pushes through two great doors into the
stark

FHRONE ROOM
Fear and awe prevent Tomas from locking eyes with the Queen
He falls to his knees He can’t stop the tears

QUEEN ISABEL
My servant why do you cry

TOMAS
To see Spain in such a state With
a disease growing in her very
heart It is too much For I have
failed her

QUEEN ISABEL
Silence
(beat)
Dare not pity Spain Spain is
great And greatness shall never
fall My glory shall shine bright
for all eternity

TOMAS
(barely murmurs)
Of course

QUEEN ISABEL
There is a plan Hope

TOMAS
Hope

QUEEN ISABEL
Father
November 2003 70

From the shadows behind her throne out steps Father Avila

The same Franciscan priest we saw torn to pieces in the
swamps of New Spain He wears a clean brown robe

Ariel helps Tomas to his feet

ARIEL
(whispers)
This is Father Avila of her
majesty’s royal Franciscan order
Their allegiance remains with

Spain

FATHER AVILA
Captain

TOMAS
Father

FATHER AVILA
This is our hope

Father Avila pulls the Mayan obsidian dagger out from under
his robe He hands it to Tomas

Tomas looks at the priest He doesn’t understand

FATHER AVILA
Spoils from the Cordoba expedition
nine years past

TOMAS
What is it A dagger

FATHER AVILA
Ceremonial Of religious matters
It was taken from around the neck
of a Mayan priest The glyph on
the blade do you see it

Tomas looks at the triangular glyph The one that looks like
the stars in the sky He nods

FATHER AVILA
It is what intrigued me about the
piece I saw the sign in the
heathen‘s scrolls on their
greatest works of gold I knew it
was of importance The Order has
worked to decipher it

(MORE)
November 2003 71

FATHER AVILA (contd)
After five years of selfless study
we have unlocked its meaning and by
doing so we have also unlocked the
Mayan’s greatest secret

Tomas leans in wanting to know the secret

Beat
FATHER AVILA
In Chetumal in New Spain in lands
already claimed by her majesty lays
the Mayans greatest treasure
But it is not gold Nor silver
Beat

TOMAS
Yes

FATHER AVILA

(points at glyph)
These are words that describe a
lost pyramid

(corrects himself)
No not lost hidden A hidden
pyramid built upon the navel of the
Earth The birthplace of life

Tomas examines the glyph

FATHER AVILA
They believe a special tree sprouts
there The Tree of Life They say
whoever drinks of its sap will live
forever

Tomas looks at the priest He turns towards the Queen his
mind filled with doubt

TOMAS
Eternal life Is this not
sacrilege

FATHER AVILA
In Genesis Adam and Eve were
forbidden from partaking of the
fruit from two trees The first
was the Tree of Knowledge the
other was the Tree of Life When
Adam and Eve committed the original
sin by eating from the Tree of
Knowledge the Lord banned them from
Eden and hid the Tree of Life
November 2003 72

ARIEL
Perhaps your Lord hid this tree in
New Spain

TOMAS
This is fantastic But can it be
true If all men are to live
forever on Earth then who shall
live in Heaven

FATHER AVILA
Heaven and Earth shall become as it
once was - one and the same
Christ died on the cross and
redeemed our sins We have been
forgiven for the crime of Eve Now
is the time to return to the Garden
and join our Lord God

ARIEL
Eternal life Imagine it
Whoever possesses such a treasure
(at a loss for words)
Infinite riches infinite power
infinite glory

QUEEN ISABEL
Glory for Spain For all eternity

Everyone turns to the Queen No one looks at her
All chins are dipped Everyone stares at the ground

QUEEN ISABEL
Kneel conquistador

Tomas kneels immediately The priest and Ariel step back

QUEEN ISABEL

The Beast runs amok in my kingdom
His master in Rome has might
superior to every army in the
world Even Spain must sit and
watch as her lands are stolen from
her

(beat)
We have little choice We must
fight And fight Spain shall
Eternal life From the jungles of
New Spain A land which has
brought us unimaginable wonders

Someone places a hand on Tomas’ shoulder
November 2003 73

It is the Queen She stands before him He rises
Tomas cannot look at Isabel

The sun is rising outside Golden light floods the heavens
and the room
QUEEN ISABEL
Will you deliver Spain from
bondage

Tomas doesn’t even need to think about an answer The Queen
wishes something to be done ‘he will do it

TOMAS
Glory be thy name I shall not
stop until I free Spain

She pulls the gold ring from a necklace around her neck and
gently places it into his palm

Tomas stares at the ring
QUEEN ISABEL
Then you shall ride with her
majesty’s banner It has been
blessed with Spain’s will And
through it you shall live forever
The Queen closes Tomas’ hand around the ring

Only his heartbeat for a moment Then the beat falters
Like a heart attack

BEEEEEEEEEE EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESP
A horrible sound jarring us awake

‘TOMAS CREO LOOKS UP
BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP
TOM CREO LOOKS UP
BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP
TOMMY CREO LOOKS UP
BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP
The sound is blaring

It is coming from the machine attached to Izzi‘s heart
November 2003 74

Flat line
The book slips to the floor

Tommy jumps up to her side He slams the red emergency
button for the nurse as he starts CPR

He beats Izzis chest Forces his breath into her mouth
Kissing her kissing her

The bedside phone starts to ring
The sun is rising outside

The revival team bursts in They try to push Tommy away from
his wife

Not a chance

TOMMY
- No Izzi Dont
Please
Please-
Please-

Finally they force him out of the way and out into the
HALLWAY
where a NURSE tries to comfort him

YOUNG NURSE
Please Sir -

Tommy tries to get back inside The nurse blocks his
entrance

YOUNG NURSE
(firm)
- The on-duty doctor is the best

Tommy turns away from her He cant just stand by
doing nothing

He starts to stalk the hallways like a caged animal

Up and down Up and down Up and down
Up and

He catches sight of a patient in another room
It’s an old man bathed in early morning light
They make eye contact
November 2003 75

The old man stares blankly at Tommy His eyes crusted with
tears Tubes sticking down his throat out of his nose
Lungs laboring for breath wheezing for air

For some reason Tommy cant look away Cant stop staring
He sees the old mans left hand twitching ever so slightly

He sees brown spots wrinkles bent arthritic fingers And a
gold wedding ring

Tommy glances down at his own hand his own wedding ring
still missing

He looks back up starts to turn away when

for a moment

the old mans eyes become his own eyes

Hés staring at himself Old and decrepit

His world slows Falls silent

He looks at the man’s left hand The ring is gone
Horror fills Tommy

Hes about to panic when

Suddenly Lillian rushes by

LILLIAN
- Tommy

Tommy snaps around Reality rushes back
TOMMY
(bewildered)
Lilly
Tommy grabs her and hugs her tight

She doesnt see the anguish or the fear in his face because
the news she holds is so great

LILLIAN
I know I know I I‘ve never
seen anything like it It‘s--

Tommy pulls back confused

TOMMY
What are you--
November 2003 76

LILLIAN
Antonio didnt get you - You
didnt hear

TOMMY
(shakes his head)
What
LILLIAN

(overwhelmed with joy)
Its Donovan The growth is
shrinking The disease is cured

TOMMY
Cured
(remembering

- Iz2i

Tommy races toward Izzisroom His eyes wide with terror

IN SPACE
The year 2150 Tom looks down at his wound He lifts his
shirt Removes the moss bandage The wound is healed
TOM
(to himself)
Cured

He remembers something He looks up concerned

TOM
Tezi

Back in the present Tommy charges into

IZZI‘S HOSPITAL ROOM

just as the on-duty doctor DR SPENCER is backing away from
the bed The nurses are turning off the machines The phone
still ringing The sun rising outside the window on a new
day and

Tommy sees the black screen

Sees the blank expressions on faces

Sees all the emptiness in the room

And then finally

he sees Izzi his wife
November 2003 77

Eyes closed

The life gone out of her

She looks different

Smaller Shes dead

Beat

CLOSE ON TOMMY

The blood draining from his face This helpless feeling

He doesnt know what to do He doesnt know how to fix this
His world is shattered

Lillian rushes into the room behind him

TOMMY
No no no no no no no no no no no no no -

Tommy pushes past Dr Spencer and races for his wifes bed
DR SPENCER
(with great compassion)

Sorry —

Tommy starts CPR again Punching her chest breathing into
her mouth So desperate

Trying to force life back into her
Dr Spencer puts a hand on Tommy
DR SPENCER
(concern)

Its too late -

Tommy explodes spinning on Spencer Throwing him up against
the wall Phone ringing

‘The nurses and residents try to pull Tommy away but his grip
is too tight He needs to hang onto somebody Something
Anything

He wont let go Hes killing the man

Finally Tommy releases him and turns back to his dead wife

He turns and races back to Izzis bed

Starts giving her CPR again
November 2003 78

Screaming at her

Phone ringing Lillian jumps in grabbing Tommy by the
shoulders
LILLIAN
(screaming)
Tommy Tommy —

Sun rising

“Tommy breathing into his wifes mouth Tears falling down

his face Fighting Fighting Not letting go Never
letting go

TOMMY
No Izzi

A shriveled leaf falls past him to the ground

He stops pumping In shock he looks down at the leaf

Back in
SPACE

Tom is terrified He looks up into the branches All of the
leaves have detached from the tree They float freely in
Zero-g

Tom tries not to panic Alarm disrupts his breaths

He runs to the tree He reaches for the little hairs
They do not reach back

‘TOM
Nooooo

He searches for life Any life Panic rising

But the tree is dead

TOM
Don’t die Not now We’re almost
there

Tom rounds the tree and sees Lillian It stops him cold

She stands with a group of mourners around an open grave
under the tree in the garden

The golden nebula disappears
The heavens turn gray with snow clouds
November 2003 79

Tom once again becomes Tommy He wears a black suit and
stands in the windswept snow-filled field of

LILLIAN’S FARMHOUSE - DAY
Up on the hill is a hundred-year-old wooden home
Theres no emotion on Tommy’s face Theres nothing at all

LILLIAN
It seems to me we struggle for a
lifetime to become whole Few of
us ever do Most of us end up -
going out the same way we came in -
kicking and screaming

A few of the guests grin to themselves knowingly But as
snowflakes melt on Tommy’s face anger builds in his brow

LILLIAN
Most of us dont have the courage -
or the strength - or the
conviction Most of us dont want
to face our fears But sometimes
it happens Young as she was Izzi
managed to accomplish that In her
death she became whole She saw
her life as a journey Death was
part of that road

Tommy looks up at Lillian like he could kill her He lets
out a painful grunt

Spins around and marches off alone in the snow

LILLIAN
Tommy

He ignores her Keeps moving
She moves after him

LILLIAN
Tommy

She grabs his wrist He stops spins around
LILLIAN
It’s okay She was okay She
accepted her death

Rage boils quickly to the surface overflowing
November 2003 80

TOMMY
STOP IT You can’t accept death
Death is the end it‘s nothing

LILLIAN
Its everything Everything must
end

TOMMY

Thats not the way it has to be
Im going to change it Death will
be no more
SMASH TO
BLACK
Out of the darkness emerges the Mayan leader ‘The Papas
Still holding the flaming obsidian sword
At the base of the
MAYAN PYRAMID
Back in the year 1535 The Mayan army watches
PAPAS
(in Mayan with
subtitles)

Death is the road to awe

The Papas raises the sword He swings it down thunderously
splitting dry air

Flames everywhere Words emerge Izzis words Her
handwriting

“Tomas’ fear paralyzed him All he could see was death”
CLOSE ON TOMMY

In the year 2004

He sits on the edge of his bed His clothes crumpled His
hair messy Black bags under his eyes Hours since Izzis
funeral

Hes reading her book The last words of it

On the next page it says “Chapter Twelve” But there is
nothing written
O

November 2003 81

Confused he flips through the pages searching for the
ending There is none

Tommy looks at the gifts Izzi gave him The inkwell and the
pen They rest on the night stand next to the bed

He re-reads the last few words He doesn’t get it

He closes the book It slips from his hand Hits the
bedroom floor

He covers his face

And then the pain of loss floods up his spine

He smashes his fists onto the night stand The lamp wobbles
as the inkwell spills over

Tommy watches blankly as the ink rushes across the night
stand and drips onto the wooden floor

Drip drip drip
He does nothing

Looks at his left hand The wedding ring is still missing
Slowly he reaches for the fountain pen

Gently he presses the tip of the pen into the tan line on
his ring finger A perfect semi-circular drop of blood
bubbles to the surface

He taps the pen into the spilled ink Then presses the ink
into the open pin prick

The tears pour out He continues to tattoo
CUT TO
HANDEL-SILVER LABORATORIES HALLWAY LATER

Tommy heads toward his lab A group of colleagues turn and
stare Awkward condolences are offered

Tommy ignores them and walks into his

LAB

Manny is working with Donovan He spins around
MANNY

(surprised)
Dr Creo
November 2003 82

Tommy ignores him makes his way up to the healthy monkey
Hes stern direct No emotion at all

TOMMY
Get me the latest scans -

Antonio reaches out to touch Tommy Tommy sees the hand
coming Before contact can be made hes out of range

ANTONIO
Are you okay

TOMMY
(ignores question)

Update me on every step youve
taken since the initial procedure

His team just stares at him
TOMMY
(stronger)
DAMN IT Come on The Donovan
breakthrough is our starting point
Stopping aging Stopping death is
our goal Come on Weve got work
to do
His team reacts They start doing their jobs
Antonio is left alone looking at Tommy
Then he turns and walks away Tom is left alone in the
GARDEN

Back in 2150 Tom stares at Antonio as he steps behind the
tree and disappears

Once again he is alone Suddenly he explodes with anger
TOM
DAMN IT Come on Weve got work
to do
But no one is around to react He blinks
Beat

The garden starts to shake So does the tree

Tom looks up
November 2003

OUTSIDE

The bubble smashes through the thickest part of the nebula

Particles collide with the surface

Millions of particles Maybe even billions
It is a beautiful fireworks show

The rattling and shaking builds until suddenly it stops
The ship bursts out of the nebulainto a clearing

In the center of the clearing is a star A dying star
Shibalba

Million mile high waves of fire and radiation twist out into

space
In the
GARDEN
fom stares at the star through the branches of the tree
And it is an amazing sight
TOM
All those years Working
Fighting To get to Shibalba To
get here for now
He looks at the dead tree
TOM
DAMN IT Come on Weve got work
to do
No answer He repeats himself
TOM
DAMN IT Come on Weve got work
to do

Beat The desperation shoots through him

TOM
No no no no no no no no no no no no no -

He rushes to the tree He hits it He pumps it He

breathes into it frying to wake it Trying to save it

fights Not letting go Never letting go

He
November 2003 84

TOMMY
No Iz2zi Izziil

He senses something Someone is watching him

Tom spins around

It is Izzi Once again shes wearing her winter jacket and
jeans

Tom explodes with anger
TOM

Why Why haunt me Now that it’s
over I‘ve failed I failed you
I failed myself The tree is dead
I can‘t save you I can’t save
anyone What do you want

But Izzi doesn’t answer she just stares at him

TOM
LEAVE ME LEAVE ME ALONE

He breaks down and cries All alone No one to comfort him
but this apparition

TOM
Please Please I’m afraid

He falls to her feet Beat

His tattooed ring finger catches his eye

He touches the ancient tattoo In

SILENCE

A flash memory of Izzi in her hospital bed Dead
Tommy being pulled away Screaming but there’s no noise
Just Izzis dead face - at peace

Complete peace

In the

GARDEN

Tom‘s sobs start to subside

Someone places a hand on his shoulder He looks up
November 2003

It is Queen Isabel She motions for him to rise
Still in the garden shooting through space
QUEEN ISABEL
Will you deliver Spain from
bondage

Tom does not know how to answer

TOM
I don’t know how

The Queen is now Izzi in her jacket and jeans

IZ21I
You do You will

TOM
I’m going to die

Izzi is once again the Queen She glows gold
She places the gold ring in Tom‘s hand
QUEEN ISABEL
Then you shall ride with her
majesty’s banner It has been
blessed with Spain’s will And
through it you shall live forever
And
TOMAS CREO LOOKS UP
And
TOMMY CREO LOOKS UP
And
TOM CREO LOOKS UP
At Izzi
Something sparkles in his eyes Inspiration
An idea

TOM
I will live forever

Tom smiles A huge smile spreading wider and wider

aie

November 2003 86

His hand is empty The ring is gone He clutches his
fingers into a fist of determination

Tommy’s hand becomes a fist Tomas‘ hand becomes a fist
Tom looks up at Izzi
TOM

(excited now)
I will live forever

She doesn’t respond She just stares at him
So he goes for it
He lowers his chin Takes a beat
And he looks back up at her
TOM
(playing the part) -
What are you doing here

IZZI
Come on let’s take a walk

Space disappears and we return to 2004 In
TOMMYS OFFICE
fom is gone Tommy is surrounded by his papers

TOMMY
I have too much work

IZ2Z1
It’s the first snow We always--

TOMMY
I can’t I have so much to do

IZZ1I
Come on Tommy

TOMMY
PLEASE Izzi

Izzi lowers her chin as she leaves

TOMMY
I’1ll see you tonight OK

She doesn’t answer
November 2003

He is alone for a moment Finally he can’t take it
He chases after her

In the

HALLWAY

He bumps into a breathless Manny

MANNY
Antonio’s on his way back

Tommy watches Izzi exiting down the hall

MANNY
Donovan‘s still prepped and ready

This is the moment

He can choose his wife or his work His life or his

This time he turns his back on Manny

He turns his back on his work

He turns his back on his future

He heads down the hallway after his wife

He floats towards the bow of the ship Tom straightens

himself so that he is hurtling face first toward the
glow of Shibalba

blinding
November 2003 88

He reaches out his hand Izzi is walking with him in 2004
through a

SNOW COVERED FIELD

The winter’s first snow sprinkles gentle flakes onto the
lovers

Tommy turns to Izzi
TOMMY
(to her)
I know how it ends

They join hands and keep walking He smiles at his future
She smiles at him Back on

THE SHIP
Tom stares at Shibalba Izzi is gone
TOM
to himself)
I can finish it
He folds his legs into the lotus position

His body reaches the top of the bubble He keeps moving A
small sphere the diameter of his body buds off of the main
ship

This miniature bubble surrounds Tom protecting him from space
as he soars closer to the dying star

Tom takes a deep breath and allows the dream to invade his
mind

A breeze flows around him Space is engulfed by a
CENTRAL AMERICAN JUNGLE

The conquistador’s eyes pop open Filled with adrenaline
Tomas stands before the

MAYAN PYRAMID

Directly in front of him stands the Papas the leader of the
Mayans

He wields the obsidian sword drenched with fire The golden
flames dance wildly across the black volcanic glass blade
November 2003 89

PAPAS
(in Mayan with
subtitles)
First Pather sacrificed himself to
the tree of life Enter and join
his fate
Tomas attacks He lifts his blade and swings
The Papas ducks under the blow A quick counter

Fire cuts through dry air In the blink of an eye Tomas has
been struck

Blood drips from the open wound below his heart
cur TO
SPACE
Toms eyes pop open He gasps in pain
Blood runs down his stomach
But this time he just stares at the wound He is not afraid
He welcomes the pain
Closes his eyes
cuT TO
MAYAN PYRAMID
Tomas injured stares at the Papas
The enemy prepares to finish the conquistador off
PAPAS
(screaming in Mayan with
subtitles)
Death Is The Road To Awe
The Mayan lifts the flaming blade and
brings it down on Tomas
The conquistador calmly closes his eyes In
SPACE

Tom breathes

November 2003 90

Calm Silence
And

Tom

Just

Lets

Go

Back at the
MAYAN PYRAMID

Tomas is at complete peace He spreads his arms welcoming
death

But the death blow does not come Something is wrong

fomas opens his eyes The flaming sword hovers inches above
Tomas’ skull

The Papas stares at the conquistador A stare of
recognition

The Mayan drops the blade and kneels before the Spaniard
The Papas dips his head

PAPAS
(in Mayan with
subtitles)
Forgive me First Father I did
not know it was you

Tomas just stares at the Papas He was expecting death Not
this

Beat
Tomas looks back at the kneeling Mayan army

PAPAS
(in Mayan with
subtitles)
I too shall be immortal I welcome
the holy dread

The Mayan leader stabs himself in the heart with Father
Avilas Mayan dagger The Papas falls backwards a smile on
his lips
November 2003 91

The Mayan army watches silently Tomas looks at them They
lower their eyes hiding from his gaze

The fierce conqueror returns The fire in Tomas’ eyes
He yanks the dagger from the shaman’s corpse

Tomas steps through the growing puddle of blood
He walks up the steep steps to his destiny

ON THE PYRAMID MOUNT

He stares back at the jungle
The sun is just rising

In

SPACE

fom opens his eyes and watches Shibalba shrink into a
pinpoint of blinding white light

It is the final moment before the star explodes
Back in

NEW SPAIN

Tomas turns into the

PYRAMID SHRINE

A dark musty small room filled with billowing sweet-smelling

incense The stucco walls are coated with blood

In the back of the shrine there is a staircase leading up
Tomas can see the morning sky

He slowly steps up into an
ENDLESS FIELD

It is a wide open prairie stretching forever in all
directions

In the center of the field is the
TREE

It is ancient Knotted and twisted with years of wisdom
Lush with life
November 2003 92

it might be the same tree thats in the space ship But
somehow its different This tree glows with a magical

inner light

Its maze-like wrinkled roots wind through the green green
grass

Tomas steps up into the field and feels as if hes staring at
the face of God

He removes his armored shoes Barefoot he carefully heads
to the tree

At the base of the tree he kneels

TOMAS

“Behold the man has become as one

of us to know good and evil And

now what if he should put forth

his hand and take also of the tree

of life and eat and then live

forever
Slowly he reaches out to touch the bark His fingers stop
an inch from the trunk The air layer surrounding the tree
vibrates ever so gently under his fingertips Little yellow
hairs reach out to greet him He pulls back his hand

Then in a single motion he plunges the obsidian dagger into
the tree

Birds of Paradise nesting in the branches noisily flap away
A droplet of thick white sap slowly flows down the blade

Tomas watches closely as it falls from the hilt and tumbles
to earth

Amazingly when the sap makes contact with the ground beneath
the green green grass beautiful blooming flowers shoot out
towards the sky

Life

Tomas carefully touches the sap Nothing happens He wipes
the sap across the wound beneath his heart

For a moment it burns and his breath shortens

But soon he feels relief Right in front of his eyes Tomas
watches the wound close and heal And in
November 2003 93

SPACE

Tom sees the wound disappear
Back in the

GRAND PLAZA

Tomas excited now notices the sap has stopped flowing The
tree has sealed its wound

He pulls the dagger out

Then he uses all of his strength to drive the dagger in
deeper

The sap flows more freely

Hé uses his hands as a cup and he gulps down the sap from the
tree like a man dying of thirst

After three generous swallows his head whips back
His arms spread wide He stares up at the tree

To him it looks unbelievable Its the most amazing thing
hes ever seen Its buzzing with life

He is witness to the fabric uniting all The leaves on the
branches are the clouds in the vast blue sky and the waves in
the deep blue sea

And now it is Shibalba

For a brief moment the conquistador soars alone through
SPACE

towards the pinpoint of light

He becomes fully aware of all life in the entire universe

He is a part of it and he takes a deep peaceful breath from
the bottom of his soul

A huge smile rushes across his face
He reaches in his pocket for the ring the Queen gave him
TOMAS

My Queen Now and forever we shall
be together
November 2003 94

As he is about to place it on his finger something gets
stuck in his throat

He is instantly back in the

MAYAN GARDEN

He coughs

Something is wrong

Tomas coughs again

And again

Now he can no longer breathe Hes choking Suffocating
Dying The ring slips from his hand He grabs for it
But it is lost in the green green grass

His bodys convulsing retching

He coughs again And again

He is able to push out the word

TOMAS
Why
Then he coughs again This time living blooming flowers
shoot out of his mouth He coughs again More flowers rush
out of his mouth His mouth is stuffed open his jaw jammed
open They are beautiful healthy and living flowers

Tomas collapses to his knees and crashes onto his back
beneath the tree

He looks down below his heart where he was wounded
Somethings bubbling beneath his skin Boiling up

Suddenly it bursts open Flowers spring forth from the
wound They rush out of him feverishly

A pool of flowers rush out from beneath him as if it was his
blood Then a shock wave of flowers flows outward from the
wound and transforms his flesh into row after row of flowers
He cries out in pain as he completely disappears

Only flowers in the shape of his body remain

And the gold ring resting on top The symbol of his Queen
November 2003 95

The symbol of his wifes love
Glimmering in the sunlight

Beat

A tattooed hand picks up the ring
Pulling it into

SPACE

Tom slides the ring onto his finger It perfectly covers the
first tattoo he gave himself so long ago

And
SHIBALBA
Goes
Supernova

The explosion sends a blinding sphere of white light into
Space It rushes at Tom

He takes his final deep breath just as the white wall of
light crashes over him

Toms face fills with awe as his body burns white hot
His flesh splits the light shattering it into the colors of
the rainbow

His body breaks apart as his atoms rain down onto the black
dying tree smothering it with red orange yellow green
blue indigo and violet rays of energy
And the tree stirs
Spring and Summer erupt All of life springs forth Brown
healthy bark grows Green leaves burst out Flowers blossom
from the branches Seeds bloom everywhere
An explosion of life In the

GARDEN

Izzi picks a seed It releases from the tree like an over-
ripe fruit

She looks at it resting in her palm and offers it to someone

Stay on her open hand for a long moment
N

November 2003

Then
Tommy takes the seed
He is alone outside of

LILLIAN‘S FARMHOUSE - DAY

In a wind swept snowy field Tommy studies the seed

Izzi is nowhere to be found

He looks down at the ground There is something buried

beneath a thin layer of snow

He kneels and wipes away the snow It is a simple grave

marker
It reads “Izzi Creo wife daughter friend”

Tommy starts to cry He digs a small hole in the
earth

And plants the seed

The tears are replaced by a sigh and a breath
He pats down the earth

Beat

Tommy looks up to the heavens

The gray sky slowly becomes the

NIGHT SKY

Crickets scream their mating calls A thunderous
Flickering in the center of the sky is Shibalba
Gold Just like at the start of the film

Tommy starts to dissolve into the ether

But he continues to stare at his destiny

Just before he disappears Shibalba explodes

Filling the sky with

frozen

noise

November 2003 97

WHITE

Beat

As the light settles

Tommy stands in the doorway of his and Izzi’s

BEDROOM

In 2004

Izzi asleep on the bed Hugging a pillow So peaceful
A new day dawning outside

She‘s so beautiful

He creeps into bed Spoons her from behind He rubs his
nose against the soft hairs on the back of her neck

She moans blissfully

The sun breaks the horizon Tommy and Izzi flooded in a
gentle morning glow

She turns to him

IZ21
Is everything all right

Tommy kisses Izzi on the lips and nestles into her back

TOMMY
Yes everythings all right

This time he means it

The sun rising Filling the room
the screen

our eyes

with blinding white light

For now and forever
