offs and hand-me-downs her version of street punk chic She
totes a skateboard under one arm (itself a berserk Jackson

unzip a flap and hike up a ragged hood against the rain She
stops to watch the grave diggers pack up and EXIT bg

Visible among the posed members of a group called Diabolique is
Eric wielding guitar on the club stage ND BLUR as people
CROSS FRAME

GRANGE 45-50 powerful a seasoned assassin cruel but loyal
His facade remains stony as he leads three other men briskly
down the corridor NGO NWA 50ish clad Chinese gangster

- white topcoat white scarf tinted shades - and two body

supplying a power perimeter around himlean dark-haired Asian
killers who would gladly die for Ngo Nwa which they will in
just a minute

They have just passed the Diabolique 8X10 Ngo Nwas gloved
fingers in passing leave little skid tracks in the dust that
clear the eyes of Eric in the photo

As the foursome reaches the DOOR Grange turns doubtfully --
suspiciously -- to Nwa

NGO NWA
He will see me unannounced

ANOTHER ANGLE - THE DOOR

As Grange keys in the enter code the door hisses open Without
a word Nwa passes inside and the door is pulled shut in
Granges face by the Bodyguards who post themselves to either
side

INT LAOS NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT

The door CLOSES and the BG NOISE is GONE Through a large
(mirrored on the club side) all sorts of activity is visible
through automatic mini-blinds A fly-vision bank of 12 TV
monitors is hot with surveillance

LAO a painfully clean-cut Armani-clad Asian impeccable
almost dashing but the dynamic here is crystal clear Nwa is

the King Lao the dark prince in this hierarchy

At the desk Lao is startled from his contemplation of a tiny
perfect rat skeleton by Ngo Nwas unheralded entry The

desktop

is bare except for and Arcane Vietnamese fighting knife half a
meter long with an ideogrammed blade dramatically positioned
beneath an Artemide lamp Lao rises and feigns servility

NB The following exchange will play FAST and entirely in
VIETNAMESE

LAO
(formal greeting)

NWA
(dismissiveness contempt then
chastizing anger as)

Nwa INDICATES the blade with some ridicule

LAO
(phony assuagement)

NWA
(knows its bullshit)

Lao turns staring out the blinds fighting for control Deep
breath He turns back to his master Nwa gestures broadly

the oppulent office indicating that Lao should be grateful
is somehow errant

NWA
(respect is required)

LAO
(begrudging agreement)

Lao sees the blade An idea He lifts it reverently bears it
the Nwa hilt-first in both hands as if bestowing a thing of
immeasurable worth

NGO NWA
(why give me this)

Nonetheless Nwa accepts the blade It gleams Hypnotic Even
Nwa has to admire it Turns it so the blade is pointed at his
sternum His attitude indicates Lao is too far away to do
anything untoward

LAO
(sinister punchline)

Lao spins through the air and HEEL-KICKS the blade THROUGH
chest pinning him to the door Its over so fast the gasp of
astonishment never escapes Nwa Lao is much more than merely

treacherous he is extremely capable

LAO
(in perfect English)
When I spoke of an offering I
didnt mean an offering to you

affirmatively

runs out of the frame

ANOTHER ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON THE RUN

as he squints towards the crow and does his best to keep up

TRACK WITH HIM to the edge of the roof heavily misted in rain

He jumps a negligible gap to the next lower roof The next

astonishment

unwanted good fortune in the form
of a man everyone is calling The Crow
Grange makes a face Cant keep his eyes off the cobra

GRANGE
Give me a break That guys a wacko

LAO
I intend no slight to you but I
cannot find the English to
adequately express just what he
is I suppose Western mythology
would describe him as a Fury

GRANGE
Not a Plymouth Fury I bet

Lao chuckles indulgently

LAO
Do you know of spirit assassins
You do know the dead can rise
Properly motivated of course

GRANGE
Like some sort of zombie ona
revenge trip

LAO
Mmm But tonight I can take what
is his

GRANGE

Only thing youll get from that

clown is a faster way to die
LAO

To the contrary

ZZLIP Lao smoothly BEHEADS the snake with the Blade against
the stone surface of the desk and discards the writhing body
He squeezes behind one of the eyes and a VENOM SAC protrudes

like a dark pimento

LAO pulls it free of the milky clinging tissue and EATS IT
Off Granges stunned expression

LAO (CONTD)
all the dying tonight will be

done by the former Eric Draven

Lao exhibits the blade to Grange as though it explains all
LAO (CONTD)
Who is only invulnerable so long
as he cares about the dead When
he begins to care about the living
youll find his heart can bleed
and I want it to bleed for me

GRANGE
Kill a dead guy

Lao POPS the second venom sac swallows it Pleased

LAO
Truly kill him So I may crush
his skull and smoke it

Lao SHRUGS Grange can handle it

Let it suffice that I need him
and to get to him well need his
little friend

Finally an assignment Grange can comfortable understand

trying

SLANTED ANGLE -- ERIC AND LAO -- Eric ARRESTS Laos fall
fisting lapels and bringing him nose to nose Fury

ERIC
Time for a sacrifice

Laos face is a hideous bloody mask with black holes where the
eyes used to be He smiles gruesomely

LAO
I dont need eyes to take what I

want from you

He EMBRACES Eric and RAMS the killing blade deep into Erics
back

ON ERIC as he looks down to see the blade protruding from his
sternum Tight grimace A lot of pain

ERIC
Can you fly

He pulls Lao into a BACKWARD ROLL down the roof HOLDING HIM
TIGHT

MOVING ANGLE -- INTERCUTS -- ERIC AND LAO FALL

Eric lands on his back forcing the blade THROUGH himself and
INTO Lao Eric completes the roll and KICKS Lao off INTO

the killing blade still embedded in him

WITH LAO as crashes sliding sprawling down PAST Ellys
position Gets to his knees atop the flying buttress Sees

blade in his own chest
CLOSE-UP - ELLY - she sees it all happen

RESUME LAO - a regretful look toward Eric He PLUMMETS off the
roof edge

ANGLE - ERIC SLIDES DOWN ROOF -- He slows stopping when Elly
is in frame He clutches his own chest Regards his own
shaking hand drenched in his won blood Glazed

ON ELLY as she finally gets the duct tape off her mouth

to get to Eric She flails and cries out

ELLY
Dont let me fall
CLOSE-UP -- their hands finally meet and GRASP TIGHT
EXT CEMETERY - NIGHT (LATER) (RAIN)

A low angle TRACKING SHOT (as when we first met Elly)
Erics and Ellys feet pass graves Erics pace is slow

crippled
limping They STOP at a grave where elly BENDS INTO FRAME to

steal
the flowers there
Eric is bloody and out of it She helps him walk
ELLY
Now do you get to see her Shelly I mean
ERIC
In a better place I hope
ELLY
Youre not gonna come back are you
Erics response is halting and uncertain But he tries to give
her hope He reaches for Shellys ring around her neck holds
it up to her
ERIC
I dont know if I can But you
have this and you know where to come
ELLY
You mean youll like dig your way
out of the grave Euww
Eric is amused by this in spite of his grievous injuries
He grasps Ellys face in his hands and bends painfullyto kiss
her on the forehead
ERIC
For you Ill try Promise
MOVE WITH ERIC
Spent empty he holds the rose determinedly but hes never
going to make it the few yards back to his own grave So
close

His legs finally go and he collapses onto the humus One
groping hand tries to drag him further
is

ERIC
Leave me now

ANGLE - ELLY

Tears on her face She cant watch this She TURNS and drops
the flowers on Shellys grave

ERICS POV - HIS OWN GRAVE
Still too far away to matter
RESUME ERIC ON GROUND

He gives it up his face sinking into the wet grass for a beat
before SHELLYS HAND intrudes INTO FRAME to GRASP his hand

No ethereal glow no heavenly choir just a near-dead Erics
blank-faced astonishment and he moves forward

ANGLE - ELLY - SHELLYS GRAVE BG

She struggles to get her hood up against the rain and roughly
wipes the moisture from her face with her sleeve She turns
toward Erics grave Then surprised she looks close

ANGLE - ERICS GRAVE

Eric is gone The white rose lies neatly on the top of the
undisturbed earth there

HIGH ANGLE - CEMETERY
Emphasizing that Elly is now ALONE in the graveyard
LOW ANGLE on Elly ROSE in the foreground --
She walks OFF HOLD the rose
