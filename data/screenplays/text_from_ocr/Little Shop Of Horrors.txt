Little Shop Of Horrors
Prologue

Alarge placard bearing the words LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS hangs suspended in dark fog (SMOKE MACHINE)
WINO 1 sleeps peacefully on the far left edge of the forestage (MUSIC CUE 1) A VOICE NOT UNLIKE GOD’S
thunders in serious prophetic tones

VOICE On the twenty-first day of the month of September in an early year of a decade not too long before our
own the human race suddenly encountered a deadly threat to it’s very existence And this terrifying
enemy surfaced — as such enemies often do — in the seemingly most innocent and unlikely of places

The placard flies out to reveal CRYSTAL RONNETTE CHIFFON DIAMOND and LIBERTY They face us
and begin to sing CHORUS enter dressed as homeless people The RONNETTE BACKING GROUP also enter

As we move from prologue to scene lighting CHORUS move downstage one group sit down R under the lamppost
another group sit on the down C steps The RONNETTE BACKING GROUP sit down L CRYSTAL RONNETTE
CHIFFON DIAMOND and LIBERTY take places on the down L stoop near WINO1 They will remain there for a while
idly reading monster-movie magazines US in the shop LIGHTS come up on MR MUSHNIK at the worktable reading the
Skid Row Daily News and waiting for customers who do not arrive In fact customers very seldom if ever arrive around
here What few flowers are in evidence are on their last legs — wilted and faded Suddenly there is an ear splitting crash
from the off R workroom MUSHNIK shouts in the direction of the noise without getting up

MUSHNIK What did you break now Krelborn
SEYMOUR offstage Nothing Mr Mushnik

AUDREY enters down R sporting a black eye She runs across the forestage into the shop As she enters the
doorbell sounds The clock strikes two and stops

MUSHNIK So she finally decides to come to work

AUDREY Good morning Mr Mushnik

MUSHNIK What morning It’s two o’clock in the afternoon He picks up a half eaten sandwich from the worktable
and starts to cross out of the shop Not that we had a customer Who has customers when you run a
flower shop on Skid Row dumps the sandwich in the down L trash can

AUDREY I’m sorry

There is another loud crash from the workroom

MUSHNIK — Seymour What is going on back there

SEYMOUR offstage Very little Mr Mushnik

MUSHNIK quickly moving back to the shop Audrey you’d better go back there and see what he’s
He gets a good look at her for the first time Audrey Where’d you get that shiner

AUDREY taking the roses from the work table and arranging them in a vase Shiner

MUSHNIK Audrey that greasy boyfriend of yours — he’s been beating up on you again she doesn ’t answer ’m
beginning to think he’s maybe not such a nice boy

AUDREY You don’t meet nice boys when you live on Skid Row Mr Mushnik

SEYMOUR enters up R with a tray of plant pots

SEYMOUR I got these plants repotted for you Mr he trips over his feet and falls sending the pots flying across
the room

MUSHNIK — Seymour

AUDREY Don’t yell at Seymour Mr Mushnik

SEYMOUR looking up from the floor Hi Audrey You look radiant today Is that new eye-make up

AUDREY standing up Ill clean it up before any of the customers get here SEYMOUR exits up stage R

MUSHNIK Well that ought to give you plenty of time He steps outside the shop Misfit employees bums on the
sidewalk business is lousy A rustle of noise from stage L stoop CRYSTAL and CHIFFON fighting over
a magazine MUSHNIK moves down L toward them You Urchins Off the stoop I don’t need three
worthless ragamuffins to complete the picture

RONNETTE Aw we ain’t bothering nobody Are we Crystal

CRYSTAL No we’re not Ronnette

MUSHNIK You ought to be in school

CHIFFON We’re on a split shift

RONNETTE Right We went to school ‘til the fifth grade then we split

MUSHNIK So how do you intend to better yourselves

CRYSTAL Better ourselves Mister when you’re from Skid Row ain’t no such thing

She turns forwards and strikes a pose which RONNETTE CHIFFON DIAMOND and LIBERTY quickly imitate

DIAMOND LIBERTY RONNETTE BACKING GROUP and CHORUS exit WINO1 picks the sandwich out of the SL
trashcan SEYMOUR starts tending to the flowers in the window AUDREY goes back into the shop where she continues
to arrange the roses MUSHNIK dejectedly returns to the counter and his newspaper Meanwhile WINO1 has moved up
L outside the shop window On a MUSIC CUE SEYMOUR MUSHNIK and AUDREY think they hear something outside
Could it be a customer They look It’s just the WINO He coughs disgustingly On a MUSIC CUE AUDREY SEYMOUR
and MUSHNIK sigh and turn back to what they were doing The clock chimes six AUDREY crosses up to C to deposit her
lifeless roses in the window

MUSHNIK Six o’clock and we didn’t sell so much as a fern I guess this is it Don’t bother coming in tomorrow
AUDREY You don’t mean

SEYMOUR You can’t mean

MUSHNIK What what what don’t I mean I mean I’m closed

AUDREY You can’t

MUSHNIK Kaput Extinct I’m closing this place

AUDREY nudges SEYMOUR forward

SEYMOUR — Mr Mushnik Has it ever occurred to you that maybe the firm needs to move in a new direction

AUDREY What Seymour’s trying to say Mr Mushnik is to SEYMOUR Seymour why don’t you run out back
and bring out that strange and interesting new plant SEYMOUR exits up R You see Mr Mushnik some
of those exotic plants Seymour has been working with are really unusual and we were both thinking that
maybe some of his strange and interesting plants would attract business

SEYMOUR re-enters R carrying Pod1 — a large but sickly looking plant — unlike any you have ever seen I’m
afraid it isn’t feeling very well today

AUDREY There Now isn’t that bizarre

MUSHNIK joining her What kind of weirdo plant is that Seymour

SEYMOUR I don’t know I haven’t been able to identify it So I gave it my own name I call it an Audrey Two

AUDREY deeply moved After me

SEYMOUR shyly I hope you don’t mind to MUSHNIK then crossing over to window You see sir if you put a
strange and interesting plant like this here in the window maybe —

MUSHNIK Maybe what Just because you put a strange and interesting plant in a window people don’t suddenly

MUSIC CUE 3A Door chimes and opens All three heads turn 3 CUSTOMERS enter the shop

CUSTOMER 1Excuse me I couldn’t help noticing that strange and interesting plant What is it
AUDREY It’s an Audrey Two

CUSTOMER 2I’ve never seen anything like it before

SEYMOUR Noone has

CUSTOMER 3 Where did you get it

SEYMOUR Well

MUSIC 03 cue
SEYMOUR You remember that total eclipse of the sun a couple of weeks ago
03 - “DA DOO”
CRYSTAL RONNETTE CHIFFON DIAMOND LIBERTY and BACKING GROUP enter down L As SEYMOUR tells
his tale they sing back-up with appropriate Girl Group hand gestures No one on stage seems to notice them SEYMOUR

walks out onto the street through the “shop wall” and CHIINESE MAN enters down R carrying a tray with plants on it
Hidden within the plants is AUDREY TWO as pod 1

GIRLS DA-DOO

SEYMOUR I was walking in the wholesale flower district that day
GIRLS SHOOP-DA-DOO

SEYMOUR And I passed this place where this old Chinese man
GIRLS CHANG-DA-DOO

SEYMOUR — He sometimes sells me weird and exotic cuttings
GIRLS SNIP-DA-DOO
SEYMOUR — Cause he knows strange plants are my hobby

GIRLS DA-DA-DA-DA-DA DA-DOO

SEYMOUR He didn’t have anything unusual there that day
GIRLS NOPE DA-DOO

SEYMOUR And I was just about to — you know — walk on by
GIRLS GOOD FOR YOU

SEYMOUR — When suddenly and without warning there was this
SEYMOUR and GIRLS TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN

LIGHTS dim then a flash of green

SEYMOUR It got very dark And then I heard a strange humming sound like something from another world
GIRLS DA-DOO

LIGHTS back up

SEYMOUR And when the light came back this weird plant was just sitting there
GIRLS OOPS-EE-DOO

SEYMOUR Just stuck in you know among the Zinnias

GIRLS AUDREY TWO

SEYMOUR I coulda sworn it hadn’t been there before But the old Chinese man sold it to me anyway

GIRLS SHA-LA-LA-LA-LA-LA SEYMOUR
DOO-DOO-DOO-DOO For a dollar ninety-five

As MUSIC ends CHINESE MAN exits R The GIRLS and BACKING GROUP exit L

CUSTOMER 1 Well that’s an unusual story

CUSTOMER 3 Sure is

CUSTOMER 2 I may as well take fifty dollars worth of roses while I’m here
MUSHNIK Fifty dollars

AUDREY Fifty dollars

SEYMOUR Fifty dollars

MUSHNIK crossing toward CUSTOMERS at work table Yes of course Right away
CUSTOMER 2 Can you break a hundred

MUSHNIK A hundred Er no

CUSTOMER 2 Well then Ill just have to take twice as many won’t I
MUSHNIK — Twice as many

AUDREY Twice as many

SEYMOUR Twice as many

AUDREY quickly grabs a handful of limp dead roses and hands them to SEYMOUR for lightning-fast
wrapping in a sheet of MUSHNIK’s newspaper at the work table

MUSHNIK — One hundred dollars worth Yes sir Right away sir Audrey fetch one hundred dollars worth of our very
finest red roses

AUDREY presents the pathetic looking bundle to CUSTOMER 2

CUSTOMER 2 Thankyou very much
CUSTOMER 3 Yes sir That is one strange and interesting plant
CUSTOMERS exit

MUSHNIK I’d never have believed it My friends I’m taking us to dinner

AUDREY Oh I’d love to Mr Mushnik but I have a date

MUSHNIK With the same nogoodnik I’m telling you Audrey you don’t need a date with him you need a major
medical

AUDREY He’s a professional

MUSHNIK — What kind of a professional drives a motorcycle and wears a black leather jacket
AUDREY He’s a rebel Mr Mushnik But he makes good money And besides he’s the only fella I’ve got Enjoy
dinner Goodnight Seymour
SEYMOUR Goodnight

AUDREY exits L

MUSHNIK Poor girl
SEYMOUR Are we still going to dinner

MUSIC 3D THE PLANT wilts — See appendix Note 1

MUSHNIK Youre not going anywhere Krelborn You’re staying right here and taking care of this sick plant How
come it’s fainting all the time

SEYMOUR I told you it’s been giving me trouble It just wilts like this The Audrey Two is not a healthy girl

MUSHNIK Strictly between us neither is the Audrey one

He exits MUSIC CUE 4 SEYMOUR crosses to the window and moves the PLANT to the worktable
SEYMOUR Are you sick little plant or just plain stubborn What is it you want What is it you need
SEYMOUR sits at the table and sings as he tends the PLANT

4—“GROW FOR ME”

SEYMOUR I’VE GIVEN YOU SUNSHINE I’ VE GIVEN YOU DIRT
YOU’ VE GIVEN ME NOTHING BUT HEARTACHE AND HURT
I’M BEGGING YOU SWEETLY I’M DOWN ON MY KNEES

TP’VE GIVEN YOU SOUTHERN EXPOSURE TO GET YOU TO THRIVE
IVE PINCHED YOU BACK HARD LIKE I’M SUPPOSED TA

YOU’RE BARELY ALIVE

TP’VE TRIED YOU AT LEVELS OF MOISTURE FROM DESERT TO MUD

Tidying the worktable around the plant See appendix Note 2
T’VE GIVEN YOU GROW LIGHTS AND MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME BLOOD

As he works he pricks his finger on a rose thorn

SEYMOUR spoken Ouch The PLANT opens it’s flytrap-like “mouth” But SEYMOUR doesn’t catch it Damned
roses Damned thorns Clumsy me Look what I did Twoey He shows the finger to THE PLANT and
notices that it is open Hey You’re opening up What made you do that

SEYMOUR unconsciously drops his finger to his side as he does As the finger disappears from it’s “view”
THE PLANT closes SEYMOUR looks at the THE PLANT again sees that it is closed and shrugs He lifts his
finger to look at the wound THE PLANT opens SEYMOUR notices this He begins to catch on He slowly hides
his finger behind his back and as he does THE PLANT slowly closes Now SEYMOUR decides to trick it He
very quickly hides his finger then quickly lifts it again As he does this THE PLANT closes and opens
mirroring his timing exactly SEYMOUR turns away with an “uh-oh” expression

SEYMOUR I think I know what made you do that Well I guess a few drops couldn’t hurt Long as you don’t make a
habit out of it or anything
SEYMOUR sings PVE GIVEN YOU SUNLIGHT I’VE GIVEN YOU RAIN
LOOKS LIKE YOU’RE NOT HAPPY ‘LESS I OPEN A VEIN
TLL GIVE YOU A FEW DROPS IF THAT’LL APPEASE
NOW PLEASE —
SEYMOUR extends his bleeding finger toward THE PLANT THE PLANT vibrates in anticipation
OH OH OH PLEASE —

SEYMOUR squeezes his finger over THE PLANT extracting a drop or two of blood The pod opens
snapping at the drops like a puppy begging for more

SEYMOUR spoken Grow for me

SEYMOUR exits into the back room As MUSIC builds we see THE PLANT begin to grow and grow
and grow until on the last chord of the music it gives a little circular flourish — almost seeming to bow

BLACKOUT See appendix Note 3

SEYMOUR runs in from R wearing a jacket and carrying AUDREY TWO THE PLANT — Pod 2 — is now almost two

feet tall It is actually a hand puppet manipulated by SEYMOUR who right arm is concealed in the pot while a stuffed
right jacket-arm and rubber hand disguise this fact to the audience See appendix Note 4 THE PLANT does not move
throughout the following

SEYMOUR Well how’d I do

LIBERTY running to him You was great Seymour

MUSHNIK But you didn’t mention the address of the shop

SEYMOUR I’m sorry I was nervous Where’s Audrey She said she’d be here

MUSHNIK Forget about Audrey I’ve got three more radio interviews lined up for tomorrow and the Skid

As the number progresses towards it’s conclusion SEYMOUR is hard-put to hide from THE GIRLS the fact that his
PLANT has a mind of it’s own It snaps at anything that’s handy and - towards the finish — it even starts to bounce and
jive in time to the music

MUSIC CUE 7 LIGHTS come up to reveal SEYMOUR emptying garbage in the stage R trash can The shop is only lit
in silhouette MUSHNIK holds a frozen attitude on the telephone at the worktable Several DECORATORS and
CLEANERS are also frozen in the shop mid-action

07 - “CLOSED FOR RENOVATION”

SEYMOUR at trash can WE’RE CLOSED FOR RENOVATION FOR SPIFFING UP AND GROOMING
“CAUSE CUSTOMERS ARE FLOCKING
AND BUSINESS HAS BEEN BOOMING
WE NEED REFRIGERATION IN OUR NEW IMPROVED DISPLAY
SO WE’RE CLOSED FOR RENOVATION TODAY

LIGHTS come up in the shop as SEYMOUR enters it and MUSHNIK and the DECORATORS and CLEANERS come to
life We see now that the place is in the midst of a transformation There are lots of new living flowers in the window The
worktable is gone In it’s place is a large object covered by a white drop-cloth SEYMOUR is cleaning

MUSHNIK on phone Yes indeed This is the shop you heard about on Channel Five News Yes the Audrey
Two is on display exclusively here

AUDREY enters from the workroom wearing a frilly pink apron She sings with SEYMOUR and gracefully begins to
mop the floor as MUSHNIK continues his phone conversation in silence

SEYMOUR and AUDREY WE’RE CLOSED FOR DECORATION
CAUSE FORTUNE HAS BEEN SMILING
SO NOW WE’RE DUE FOR PAINTING
NEW PLUMBING AND RE-TILING
WE’LL MAKE A SHIP SHAPE SHOWPLACE OF OUR LITTLE SHOP AND THEN
TOMORROW WE’LL BE OPEN AGAIN

MUSHNIK hanging up the phone and addressing SEYMOUR who still is cleaning Aren’t you finished yet

SEYMOUR Holds up his hands We see that he has band-aids on each 0 his ten fingers I’m doing my best
but all these band-aids make it kinda hard

AUDREY You’ve been getting hurt so much lately

SEYMOUR Er know seems like every time I pick up a pruning shears I slip

During the rest of the number SEYMOUR AUDREY MUSHNIK and the DECORATORS and CLEANERS complete the
transformation of the shop removing dust sheets to reveal a brand new window display bordered with twinkling lights a
new work table with a shiny new fagade also bordered with lights and a shiny new cash register on the counter And all
the while they are all singing and dancing very merrily

ALL WE’RE CLOSED FOR RENOVATION

until the script indicates otherwise On applause after the number MUSHNIK takes a clipboard from the worktable Out
on the Forestage CRYSTAL CHIFFON and DIAMOND enter L and take positions on the L stoop CHIFFON silently
starts doing CRYSTAL and DIAMOND’s nails At the same time RONNETTE and LIBERTY enter R and sit on the edge of
the stage also doing their nails

MUSHNIK finding a notation on his clipboard Seymour did you send out that order for Mrs Shiva

SEYMOUR Mrs Shiva er I forgot

MUSHNIK exploding You forgot How could you forget an order like that crosses to Seymour The
Shiva’s are our most important funeral account A big enormous family and they’re dropping off
like flies

MUSHNIK exits R SEYMOUR just stands there After a moment of embarrassed silence AUDREY takes a bunch of
flowers from the window and crosses to the work table She will continue to work on the arrangement intermittently
throughout the following scene

AUDREY You know sometimes I think Mr Mushnik’s too hard on you

SEYMOUR Oh I don’t mind After all I owe him everything He gave me a warm place to sleep under the
counter Floors to sweep and toilets to clean and every other Sunday off

AUDREY You know I think you oughta raise your expectations Seymour Why don’t you start with some

new clothes

SEYMOUR self conscious gets a plant-mister from the window

No offence but a big important botanist has to look the part
SEYMOUR crosses to PLANT to mist it I’m a very bad shopper Audrey I don’t have good taste like you
AUDREY Well I could help you pick things out

MAN

When MUSIC ends SEYMOUR and AUDREY hug THE GIRLS exit R As soon as they clear MUSHNIK enters R He
stands looking at AUDREY and SEYMOUR still hugging He stares at them ominously for a moment then speaks

MUSHNIK So AUDREY and SEYMOUR pull apart quickly It seems the plot thickens Audrey I wonder if
you’d excuse Seymour and me for a little while Staring straight at SEYMOUR Perhaps you’d
like to go visit your dentist friend He crosses into the shop

SEYMOUR following him into the shop That’s not funny You know he disappeared

AUDREY enters the shop

MUSHNIK kneels on the floor stage C and begins to examine something down there Sarcastically
Oh that’s right He did didn’t he

AUDREY Seymour what’s he talking about What’s he doing

SEYMOUR guiding her to the doorway Why don’t you run along like he asked Audrey

AUDREY Okay Goodnight Seymour Goodnight Mr Mushnik She exits

MUSHNIK still on the floor examining Little red dots All over the floor

SEYMOUR You’ re acting pretty strange

MUSHNIK Ihad a pretty strange afternoon I was called to the police station

SEYMOUR The police

MUSHNIK Yes It seems they found a Mushnik’s Skid Row Florists bag in the dentist’s office
MUSIC CUE 15A resumes with two more MELODRAMATIC CHORDS
Little red dots all over the lino

SEYMOUR stepping toward him I I spilled a drink and it stained

MUSHNIK Hard to keep things clean around here isn’t it Especially when they only remove our garbage

once a month

MUSIC CUE 12 MUSHNIK leaves the shop and begins to move slowly and deliberately across the Forestage
toward the down R trash can THE PLANT slowly moves from upright neutral to lips forward position then pans it’s
focus as if able to see MUSHNIK through the shop wall

SEYMOUR follows MUSHNIK What are you talking about

They are both at the R trash can THE PLANT is focused on them MUSHNIK reaches into the trash can and pull’s
out ORIN’s dentist uniform

MUSHNIK This A dentist’s uniform
On a MUSICAL CHORD MUSHNIK tosses the uniform at SEYMOUR who catches it and holds it in horror

12 “SUPPERTIME”
PLANT starts to sing Although MUSHNIK and SEYMOUR don’t hear them the words are the thoughts

in SEYMOUR’s head
HE’S GOT YOUR NUMBER NOW

MUSHNIK I saw it last week and didn’t think twice
PLANT HE KNOWS JUST WHAT YOU DONE
MUSHNIK And the little red dots seemed innocent enough
PLANT YOU GOT NO PLACE TO HIDE
MUSHNIK But now I catch you kissing the dentist’s girlfriend
PLANT YOU GOT NO WHERE TO RUN
MUSHNIK And it begins to look like a motive
PLANT HE KNOWS YOUR LIFE OF CRIME
MUSHNIK Once he’s out of the way you move in right
PLANT with a big circular lip synch down C

I THINK IT’S SUPPERTIME
SEYMOUR throwing dentist’s uniform US of trash can 1m innocent I’m innocent
MUSHNIK Then come with me to the police and tell them that
THE PLANT focuses on them strongly and sings
PLANT HE’S GOT HIS FACTS ALL STRAIGHT
MUSHNIK Just so my conscience will rest easy
PLANT YOU KNOW HE’S ON YOUR TRAIL
MUSHNIK If you don’t Ill have to go tell them myself
PLANT HE’S GONNA TURN YOU IN
MUSHNIK Now will you come
PLANT THEY’RE GONNA PUT YOU IN JAIL
SEYMOUR O Okay
PLANT HE’S USDA P-RIME

FOR MY SUPPERTIME
MUSHNIK turns US and starts toward the shop I’ll go lock up we’ll head over

MUSHNIK enters the shop and moves quickly stage R into the workroom THE PLANT returns to upright neutral
position just long enough to seem immobile while MUSHNIK passes through As soon as MUSHNIK has disappeared
into the work room THE PLANT’s focus returns to SEYMOUR The sunset casts long foreboding shadows

PLANT COME ON COME ON THINK ABOUT ALL THOSE OFFERS

As THE PLANT sings the following SEYMOUR shaken and terrified slowly crosses to the shop enters it moves to
the DS right corner and stands there

COME ON COME ON YOUR FUTURE WITH AUDREY
COME ON COME ON AIN’T NO TIME TO TURN SQUEAMISH
COME ON COME ONI SWEAR ON ALL MY SPORES —
WHEN HE’S GONE THE WORLD WILL BE YOURS
PLANT returns to upright neutral

MUSHNIK enters from back room Okay Seymour Let’s go

CRYSTAL RONETTE CHIFFON DIAMOND and LIBERTY appear stage L and LIGHTS pick them up THE PLANT

MUSHNIK nods again then crosses to Lof PLANT He knocks on THE PLANT three times Very slowly now THE
PLANT begins to open MUSHNIK just stands there amazed and shocked When THE PLANT is fully open

MUSHNIK hesitates for a moment then shrugs and looks inside it’s mouth As he’s looking THE PLANT very slowly
begins to close MUSIC gets louder and stranger It takes MUSHNIK a moment to realise what’s happening and

when he does it’s too late THE PLANT then chomps down mightily Simultaneously with the chomp there’s a

MUSICAL CHORD MUSHNIK screams “Seymour” A second MUSICAL CHORD as THE PLANT chomps again
Another scream A third more sustained MUSICAL CHORD as THE PLANT executes one last chomp and some chewing
