FADE IN
CREDITS AND MUSIC OVER
INT AUDIENCE ROOM - GRANADA - DAY

We start on a mans elegant slipper He is seated in a
splendid chair Moving up the stocking leg we pass the
garter of Castile coming to rest on a pair of delicate
hands His fore finger impatiently plays with a large
topaz ring Over this we hear distant footsteps echoing
on marble floors

A Castilian face aquilaine profile olive complexion
dark eyebrows and meticulously sculpted beard This is
TREASURER SANCHEZ

A door slams somewhere the footsteps getting closer We
can now here a subdued conversation

TREASURER SANCHEZ stands up as

The door opens at the far end of the large gilded room
A WOMEN magnificent in somber taffeta enters QUEEN
ISABEL OF SPAIN moves towards him

He bows slightly as she sits at the end of the large
table She is followed by a PRIEST BROTHER BUYL and

three dignitaries of Church and State

All sit beside her TREASURER SANCHEZ takes a document
and starts to read aloud

On screen the words GRANADA - SPAIN - 1500

CuT TO
SANCHEZ
Your Majesty would wish to know the
true facts concerning the island of
Hispanola our first settlement in
the New World and the activities
there of your servant Christopher
Columbus Admiral of the Ocean Sea
Governor of that Island You will
remember with what hopes and
promises he beguiled us -- the truth
is that he now presides over a state
of chaos degradation and madness
beyond imagining

SANCHEZ punctuates each word carefully

The PRIEST nods

SANCHEZ
From the beginning Columbus proved
himself incapable of managing the
affairs of the island He appointed
his brothers to important positions
at once injuring the pride and
dignity of the nobles who had gone
with him He promised to build a
city the City of Isabel named
after Your Majesty What he
actually built was nothing but a
collection of huts and that in the
wrong place for all of it was
easily swept away by rain and mud
Is that not so Brother Buyl

BROTHER BUYL
Yes Your Honor

SANCHEZ
He promised gold Not finding the
easy quantities he promised
Columbus commanded each Indian to
pay an annual tribute Most being
unable to they were barbarously
punished against the express wish
of Your Christian Majesties

ISABEL lowers her eyes

SANCHEZ
Since provocation and injustice
never ceases many of the Indians
have fled to the forests or have
begun to slay the Christians

ISABEL looks over at BROTHER BUYL
ISABEL
Could it be so

BROTHER BUYL
Yes Your Majesty

SANCHEZ

But there is worse From the
beginning he forced the nobles to
undergo physical labor treating
them equally with the Indians all
of them reduced to slavery When
the nobleman Adrian de Moxica
protested against such treatment

(he pauses)
he was executed

(pause)
Is that not true also Brother
Buyl

BROTHER BUYL
Yes Your Honor It is all true
All of it I saw it with my own
eyes

SANCHEZ
He has lost control His great
arrogance has led him into
depravity He encourages our
soldiers to marry the native women
He promised a paradise but he has
made a hell full of all its horrors

Silence
ISABEL
Is that the man I knew Treasurer
Sanchez
SANCHEZ

Yes Your Majesty

INT HUT - ISLAND - DAY

CLOSE ON the FACE COLUMBUS is stretched on a bed
sweating heavily in fever clearly delirious Insects
crawl over his face he makes no effort to swat them away
There is a dripping sound of water

FERNANDO (VO)
Of all the words my Father wrote and
there were many I remember these
the most Nothing that results
from human progress is achieved with
unanimous consent

CuT TO
TO

Rain is falling into the room over documents spread on a
table COLUMBUS stands up and moves to the table Some
of the walls have been blackened with smoke and flames A
lizard scuttles into the shadows

FERNANDO (VO)
And those who are enlightened
before the others are condemned to
purse that light in spite of
others

COLUMBUS stares down at the documents moving them away
from the rain drips He stares out by the window and we
see

A devastated landscape Flooded roads half-destroyed
huts broken trees A dog picks its way through the mud

FERNANDO (VO)
There was a time when the New World
didnt exist

DISSOLVE

EXT OCEAN - DAY

A vast stretch of ocean It fills the screen Unbroken
infinite luminous mysterious -- it stretches away
meeting and blending with the sky in pale ribbons of pearl
and misty light

FERNANDO (VO)
The sun set in the west on an
ocean where no man had dared to
venture And beyond that
infinity

Pulling back we discover

A TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY and a strongly built man in his middle
thirties are riding a mule The MANS weather-beaten
face frames unusually bright eyes

On the screen these words ANDALUSIA 1491

COLUMBUS AND HIS SON are following a windthrashed path at
the top of the hill COLUMBUS hums a song and FERNANDO
looks up at him in adoration

FERNANDO (VO)
Once I asked my Father where he
wanted to go And he replied I
want to travel all over the seas I
want to get behind the weather
FERNANDO laughs He then starts to hum along with his
FATHER

CuT TO
EXT HILLSIDE APPROACH TO LA RABIDA - DAY

A rugged landscape remote and steep with lines of stone
walls and thousands of sheep

FERNANDO rushes down a slope barking like a dog chasing
the sheep who fan out in droves in front of him High-
spirited and wild FERNANDO laughs and tumbles over

COLUMBUS rides his mule along the narrow track watching
his SONS antics with amusement In the distance the
solitary figure of A MONK SHEPHERD

COLUMBUS calls out to his son

COLUMBUS
Fernando

FERNANDO runs over COLUMBUS lifts him up onto the mule

As they move along the track we now see perched on a
distant hill isolated and austere the Monastery of La
Rabida their destination

EXT CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAY

As they dismount and walk into the quiet cloisters
FERNANDO suddenly spots a familiar FIGURE standing under
the ROMAN arches

FERNANDO
Diego

He rushes over full of joy to kiss his BROTHER -- an
adolescent dressed in the novice-robe with a solemn
delicate face DIEGOS response is constrained

COLUMBUS
Diego Arent you going to kiss
your brother

DIEGO smiles a little and kisses FERNANDO -- who is
immediately distracted by a procession of hooded MONKS
hurrying to the refectory as a bell begins to chime

The MONKS all turn to greet ANTONIO DE MARCHENA a white-
haired elderly man -- and a monk cosmographer

MARCHENAS gesture is broad and elegant as he opens his
arms to greet COLUMBUS He pats FERNANDOS head and turns
to DIEGO
MARCHENA
Diego take Fernando to the dining
hall He must be hungry

DIEGO
Yes Father

Both CHILDREN leave under the arched roof COLUMBUS and
MARCHENA begin to walk across the cloister

MARCHENA
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure
to teach -- but so serious

Brothers should be raised together
Colon Even brothers from different
mothers

COLUMBUS
Father I am doing what I think is
the best for him And he has the
teacher I would have chosen for
myself

MARCHENA laughs at the compliment

MARCHENA
Just be careful you dont lose him

They have crossed the cloister MARCHENA pushes open a
door

INT A HUGE LIBRARY - LA RABIDA - DAY

Hundreds of books lined up on the shelves displaying the
miracle of printing a recent German discovery Several
MONKS perched on high stools behind lecterns are busily
ILLUMINATING some of these massive volumes delicately
painting around the letters in bright colors and gold
leaf

Rays of light fall diagonally through high openings
projecting geometric patterns on the tiled floor As
MARCHENA and COLUMBUS move forward their conversation is
punctuated by light and shadow

MARCHENA
(fumbles in a pocket
under his robe)
I have something for you

Almost casually he hands COLUMBUS a letter
MARCHENA

You will be heard at the University
of Salamanca
COLUMBUS stops dead in his tracks Almost frantically he
tears open the letter hardly able to believe his eyes

COLUMBUS
God Thats in a week

MARCHENA
Thats what it says

COLUMBUS
How did you manage it

MARCHENA
(smiling)
With some difficulty I had to
promise them you were not a total
fool

MARCHENA pushes open a second door hidden behind a wooden
panel

INT STUDY - LA RABIDA - DAY

MARCHENA is not a tidy man Books are piled up on the
floor the desk on every shelf along with maps
instruments of astronomy the visible evidence of an
inquiring mind

With practiced familiarity as if they had done this a
hundred times -- which indeed they have -- MARCHENA sits
behind his desk and COLUMBUS opposite him MARCHENA
lights a candle and considers the mess Then
methodically he slowly sweeps it from in front of him
with his sleeve exposing a large map underneath

When he looks up again there is a new severity in his
expression He turns over an hourglass

MARCHENA
Why do you wish to sail west

COLUMBUS
To open a new route to Asia At the
moment there are only two ways of
reaching it

He leans forward and points to the map spread out on the
desk

COLUMBUS
By sea sailing around the African
Continent -- the journey takes a

year

His finger traces the journey from west to east
COLUMBUS
Or by land

We are CLOSE now on the map as we watch his finger
tracing a line between Europe and the Far East

COLUMBUS (0S)
But the Turks have closed this
route to all Christians Trading
with the Orient has become arduous
if not dangerous
(he pauses)
There is a third way

We notice that the outline of the European continent is
familiar But we also notice that in that great expanse
of ocean the whole American continent is missing

COLUMBUS
By sailing West across the Ocean
Sea

CLOSE ON MARCHENAS FACE touched by the mystery

MARCHENA
How can you be so certain The
Ocean is said to be infinite

COLUMBUS
Ignorance I believe the Indies are
no more than 750 leagues west of the
Canary Islands

MARCHENA
How can you be so certain

COLUMBUS
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin
de Tyr Esdras

MARCHENA
(interrupting)
Esdras is a Jew

COLUMBUS
So was Christ

MARCHENA throws his quill in the air in frustration He
glances at the hourglass

MARCHENA
Two minutes and already youre a
dead man Dont let passion
overwhelm you Colon

COLUMBUS
(mockingly)
Ill try to remember that
Marchena

MARCHENA
Father Marchena

COLUMBUS
(ignoring this)
Passion is something one cannot
control

MARCHENA
(heatedly)
You get so carried away when you are
being contradicted

COLUMBUS
Ive been contradicted all my
life Eternity
MARCHENA
(amused)

Only God knows the meaning of such
words my son

EXT COURTYARD - LA RABIDA - EVENING

DIEGO and FERNANDO wait in the courtyard COLUMBUS
appears and lifts FERNANDO onto the mule DIEGO turns to
go

COLUMBUS
Diego

COLUMBUS walks over to him squats down so their eyes
meet He looks at his SON for a moment

COLUMBUS
Would you like to come and stay with
us

Uncomfortable with the proposition DIEGO cannot find an
answer

COLUMBUS
Ill do whatever makes you happy

DIEGO
I am happy Father

COLUMBUS reaches out -- and touches his shoulder

He climbs up behind FERNANDO who waves back to his
BROTHER as they ride off
EXT CADIZ - STREETS AND CATHEDRAL SQUARE - NIGHT

COLUMBUS leads the mule carrying the sleeping FERNANDO
through narrow streets Theres a clamorous noise in the
air Suddenly a large group of YOUNG MEN shouting with
excitement run up the street and brush past them Then
more people FERNANDO sits up straight The noise grows
rowdy rumbling sharp with excitement and violence

Huge CROWDS have thronged the massive old square outside
the cathedral Holding the mule by its reins COLUMBUS
tries to push his way through Suddenly as a gap opens
in the crowd we see the cause of the excitement in the
center of the square stand three pyres already alit
HOODED EXECUTIONERS are busy around the fires

FERNANDO
Look Father

Before COLUMBUS can stop him FERNANDO has slipped off the
mule and into the crowd

COLUMBUS
Fernando

But the BOY has been swallowed into the mass of people
COLUMBUS tries to follow him Flames leap into the night
sky with a terrible crackling lighting up the square with
a lurid glow Prayers are being chanted somewhere

FERNANDO has elbowed his way to the front of the crowd

A PRIEST brandishes a crucifix in front of the face of a
MAN bound to a post The heretic wears the sambenito a
robe made of coarse fabric on which his sins have been
crudely illustrated -- we see cabalistic signs

indicating that the man is Jewish

THE MANS eyes are mad with fear But he refuses to kiss
the crucifix as a sign of his repentance

FERNANDO is transfixed by the scene but still doesnt
realize what is happening He is too close to the
platform to see what is in the flames of the other pyres

COLUMBUS
Fernando

He motions to his son takes the BOYS hand and drags him
away from the scene But FERNANDO looks back The
distance now allows him to see inside the flames

A HALF-CHARRED FIGURE -- THE MANS face is distorted in a
silent scream The neck snaps like burning wood and the
head falls on one shoulder Then the whole body collapses
into the fire
INT BEATRIXS HOUSE - HALLWAY AND STABLE - NIGHT

COLUMBUS and FERNANDO lead the mule into the white-washed
stone-floored hallway of the modest house FERNANDO is
mute shocked by what he just witnessed COLUMBUS takes
the mule into its stall and as he does so his mother
BEATRIX appears from the kitchen to greet them She is a
beautiful woman in her twenties a calm strong domestic
personality COLUMBUS tousles the BOYS hair FERNANDO
glances at his MOTHER but looks subdued and doesnt say
anything

INT BEATRIXS HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

COLUMBUS joins BEATRIX in the kitchen where a MAID is
cooking He explains Fernandos subdued manner

COLUMBUS
Executions In the square

BEATRIX nods He goes to the stone butt and pours water
on his hands

COLUMBUS
Theyve agreed to see me in a week

BEATRIX puts the candle on the table Her face lights up
with a smile He walks to her and kisses her

COLUMBUS
I could be gone for years

BEATRIX
I know

COLUMBUS
I havent given you much of a life

BEATRIX
(amused)
Well thats true I have a child
by a man who wont marry me Whos
always leaving

COLUMBUS
Are we going to argue

BEATRIX
Id love to argue with you
sometimes But youre never here
They laugh and kiss
COLUMBUS

Perhaps I was never meant to live
TO

with a woman

BEATRIX
(still kissing him)
I find that hard to believe

DISSOLVE

INT BEATRIXS HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

They are eating around the table and FERNANDO is
unusually silent and thoughtful COLUMBUS pours a little
wine into FERNANDOS water to distract him FERNANDO
looks up at him surprised COLUMBUS smiles then looks
over at BEATRIX

COLUMBUS
Fernando dont you think we are
lucky to live with such a beautiful
woman

He winks at FERNANDO BEATRIX smiles

INT BEATRIXS HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The room is dark As COLUMBUS approached the bed with a
candle it illuminates the naked body of BEATRIX BEATRIX
looks up at him intently A drop of wax falls on her
skin She flinches murmurs

They make love

EXT SALAMANCA UNIVERSITY - DAY

A medieval campus Students-novices are playing
pelote with basket-gloves and a hard ball They run
with their robes tucked around their waist revealing
white legs Others are studying reading hurrying to
their class

We find COLUMBUS watching the game from the steps above
the court Others are waiting with him A MONK comes
from a door and looks around the group

MONK
(hesitant)
Christopher Columbus

INT AUDIENCE ROOM - UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY

An El Greco painting A tableau of twenty MEN sitting on
dark sculpted seats Candles throw a gloomy light on
their faces Some are Churchmen others are dressed in
bourgeois outfits

Only one of them is richly dressed in the grand Spanish

fashion -- he is SANCHEZ Treasurer of the House of
Aragon A MONK (Don AROJAZ) holds a stick with an ivory
claw at the top Languidly he scratches his back -- his

off-hand manner only makes him more impressive than his
peers

AROJAZ
You say Asia can be found by sailing
west

COLUMBUS

Yes your Eminence The voyage
should not take more than six or
seven weeks

AROJAZ
Unfortunately Don Colon that is
precisely where our opinions
differ
(pause)
Are you familiar with the work of
Aristotle Erathostene Ptolemeus

COLUMBUS
I am Your Eminence

AROJAZ

Then you cannot ignore that
according to their calculations the
circumference of the Earth is
approximately

(he leans forward)
22000 leagues or more Which makes
the ocean uncrossable

He leans back satisfied and pauses for effect

AROJAZ
But you may have found new evidence
proving that these men of knowledge
are totally mistaken

A ripple of mirthless laughter

COLUMBUS
Your Excellencies are aware of the
statements of Marin de Tyr

HERNANDO DE TALAVERA
We are

COLUMBUS
Then you are also aware that his
theories contradict Ptolemeus De
Tyr believes the Ocean to be only
750 leagues

A murmur of protest spreads among the members of the
Commission But Columbus is determined to press his
theories

COLUMBUS
The Florentine Toscanelli and the
French Cardinal Pierre dAilly both
think that Marin de Tyr is accurate
in his calculations And therefore
that the ocean can be crossed

Indignant and amused murmurs DIEGO DE DEZA raises his
voice to quiet the assembly

DIEGO DE DEZA
Gentlemen let us suppose Marin de
Tyr is right
(the laughter
subsides)
Are we here to examine this proposal
or not

Silence

DIEGO DE DEZA
(to Columbus)
In your opinion how long would the
voyage be

COLUMBUS
Seven weeks Six during the summer
months
The murmur increases
AROJAZ
Marin de Tyr is wrong -- and has

been corrected many times over the
centuries by the finest geographers
Your voyage Don Colon would take a
year

A MAN of simple bearing that COLUMBUS identifies as
being a seaman interrupts

VICUNA
How would the crew survive without
being able to land for fresh water
Water is undrinkable after six
weeks Youd never be able to turn
back

COLUMBUS
We wouldnt have to turn back We
Instantly the protests stop

He pauses and starts walking in front of the experts

would find land at this point

AROJAZ
Senor Colon an experienced captain
such as yourself will understand our
concern with the crew I am not
willing to have on my conscience the
loss of men who would have relied
upon our judgment

COLUMBUS
Excellency you are right

COLUMBUS
I am a seaman not a scholar But
as a simple man craving for
knowledge I have read all the work
of these renowned geographers and
discovered that none of them could
agree on the exact width of this
ocean

a lawyer before a grand jury

COLUMBUS
Therefore as a modest man I
wonder who is right

as

The experts listen CLOSE ON SANCHEZS FACE impressed by

the boldness

He walks and stops before TALAVERA

COLUMBUS
Who is right This question remains
unanswered

of SANCHEZ sitting just behind him

COLUMBUS

Your Eminence there is only one way
to settle the matter And that is
to make the journey

(to the assembly

with passion)
I am ready to risk my life to prove
it possible

AROJAZ
Your life and that of others

COLUMBUS
If they agree to follow me yes

SANCHEZ (0S)

and catches the look
Suppose you cross this ocean
Suppose you reach Asia What would
Spain do there

Conscious of a friendlier voice COLUMBUS sees the
Treasurer SANCHEZ an imposing man in his fifties

COLUMBUS
Trade Your Excellency According
to Marco Polo the Kingdom of China
is one of the richest of the world
Even the meanest buildings are
roofed with gold

AROJAZ
(interrupting)
Is that all that interests you
Gold
COLUMBUS

No The Portuguese have already
discovered black-skinned people I
too will find other populations --
and bring them to the word of God

THE MONK smiles thinly

AROJAZ
Christopher -- Christo Ferens -- the
Bearer of the Cross

MONK
(ironic)
And Colon -- the one who populates

Another small rill of laughter

AROJAZ
If God intended our proximity to
Asia do you believe he would have
waited for you to show it to the
world

COLUMBUS
Did He not choose a carpenters son
to reveal Himself to the world

A hum of interest CLOSE ON SANCHEZ -- watching COLUMBUS
intently a hint of an admiring smile on his lips

AROJAZ
So you consider yourself the chosen
one

A pause

AROJAZ
Dont you realize your words could
be considered heretical

COLUMBUS
(calmly)
Blind faith is what I consider
heresy

The murmur turns to an audible gasp AROJAZ gets to his
feet and leans forward threateningly the flame of a
candle only inches from his face

There is absolute silence COLUMBUS meets the MONKS gaze
unflinchingly

COLUMBUS
(quietly)
Asia can be found to the west -- and
I will prove it

AROJAZ
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT

EXT TERRACE - UNIVERSITY - DAY

The JURY is alone to deliberate Food and wine has been
laid out on tables In the distance students cries
carry over the conversation

SANCHEZ approaches

AROJAZ
The Treasurer of Spain honors us
with his presence

SANCHEZ bows slightly

SANCHEZ
The State has some reason to be
interested in this mans
proposition Your Eminence

AROJAZ
The Judgment is ours

SANCHEZ
Naturally But I would really
deplore the loss of such a potential
opportunity for Spain for a
dispute over a point of geography

SANCHEZ helps himself to some grapes looks round at the
other members of the committee who pretend not to be
listening

AROJAZ
(interrupting)
He is a mercenary Did he not
already try to convince the King of
Portugal of his absurd notions

SANCHEZ
Indeed The world is full of
mercenaries -- and states often make
use of them when it benefits them
(casually)
My only concern is the welfare and
prosperity of Spain

AROJAZ understands the hint and stops smiling

AROJAZ
You would use your influence to
assist this intriguer

SANCHEZ reaches for a decanter of sherry

SANCHEZ
You know Your Eminence the
fascinating thing about power is
that what can be given so
effortlessly

He offers the decanter to AROJAZ who automatically lifts
his glass But instead SANCHEZ pulls back the decanter
pours himself a drink and replaces it on the table
leaving AROJAZ staring at his own empty glass

SANCHEZ
can so easily be taken away

And he drinks with a smile

INT LA RABIDA - MARCHENAS STUDY - EVENING

MARCHENA reads aloud the Commissions letter

MARCHENA
and therefore nothing could
justify the participation of Your
Highnesses in the venture that
relies upon such feeble assumptions
and which any man of knowledge
would take to be impractical if
not impossible

He shakes his head puts the letter down COLUMBUS looks
appalled devastated

COLUMBUS
They didnt listen They didnt
want to listen
He paces about the book-lined room

MARCHENA
You mustnt give way to despair
You must wait

COLUMBUS
Wait Ive waited seven years
already How much longer do you
want me to wait

MARCHENA
If God intends you to go then you
will go
COLUMBUS
(angrily)
Damn God
MARCHENA is shocked
MARCHENA
Colon
COLUMBUS

Damn all of you You all set up
theories based on what You never
leave the safety of your studies
Go out Find out what the world is
about and then tell me something I
can listen to

He seizes a beautiful book from MARCHENAS desk

COLUMBUS
These dont mean anything Theyre
full of assumptions Out of the
heads of old men whove never been
past the end of their gardens

He hurls the book across the room MARCHENA is horrified

MARCHENA
No My books

COLUMBUS seizes more books from the shelves just sweeping
them to the floor

COLUMBUS
All of them Just lies

MARCHENA
Colon Dont

MARCHENA tries to stop him In his fury COLUMBUS
accidentally knocks the poor old MAN to the ground His
cries bring three MONKS rushing into the room

As COLUMBUS continues to rage and scatter books
everywhere they try to stop him struggling with this
big powerful man -- to almost comical effect Finally a
short muscular MONK delivers a quick punch that sends
COLUMBUS crashing to the floor

INT CHAPEL OF LA RABIDA - EVENING

COLUMBUS lies face down on the stone floor He is dressed
in a homespun robe His arms are stretched out in
penance FERNANDO and DIEGO look down at him

FERNANDO
Father
DIEGO
Sssshhhh One cant speak to a

man doing penance

FERNANDO
What can you do

DIEGO
Nothing Thats the point
Fernando
A pause -- and then FERNANDO lies face down on the floor

beside his FATHER and stretches out his arms in the same
way DIEGO is left looking on unable to bring himself to
join them

EXT CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAY

Along the cloister maps are drying hanging like laundry
in the light breeze COLUMBUS pins up a new addition
Another MONK works nearby in silence

PINZON (0S)
Senor Colon

COLUMBUS turns to see a small stocky MAN approaching a
middle-class gentleman He nods

PINZON
Ah thank God Ive been looking
all over Seville for you Never
expected to find a sailor ina
monastery eh

He laughs COLUMBUS smiles but doesnt say anything
PINZON is clearly a little surprised

PINZON
Names Pinzon by the way Martin
Alonzo Pinzon Im a ship owner
from Palos

COLUMBUS glances around cautiously and walks a little way
down the cloister away from the other MONK gesturing for
PINZON to follow him PINZON is yet more surprised by
this strange behavior

PINZON
(indicating the
monk)
Is he a spy

COLUMBUS shakes his head PINZON stares at him
perplexed

PINZON
What is it Are you a Trappist

COLUMBUS shakes his head again

PINZON
Vow of silence Penance
COLUMBUS nods vigorously
PINZON

Jesus Just my luck

He takes off his hat wiping his forehead with a silk
cloth

PINZON
Listen Ill do the talking for
both of us You just nod Agreed
Just as I do with the wife

COLUMBUS nods

PINZON
I know that the Commission turned
you down right What do you
expect Youre a foreigner But I
want to help you

COLUMBUS gives him a glance like one throws a question in
the air

PINZON
You wonder why I believe in you
Hey I am a seaman And we dont
like to be told where to go and
where not to go

COLUMBUS looks at him and bursts out laughing The other
MONK looks round severely COLUMBUS ducks behind a map
PINZON following him PINZON lowers his voice

PINZON
I dont look like it but I have
friends at the Court The Treasurer
of Aragon for example He finances
me His names Santangel Ever
heard of him

COLUMBUS shakes his head but looks increasingly
interested by what hes hearing

PINZON
He can get you an audience with the
Queen You know why She owes
him money Thats how it is You

-- me -- the Queen -- the world and
his mistress -- agreed
COLUMBUS nods
PINZON

So What do you say

COLUMBUS looks around catches the disapproving face of
the MONK crosses himself then speaks

COLUMBUS
Where can I meet this man

PINZON
(indicating with a
nod)
Immediately

COLUMBUS turns and sees an elegant Lord in his fifties
examining the maps

EXT STREETS OF GRANADA - DAY

A huge Islamic Crescent being pulled down from the minaret
of a mosque SOLDIERS are holding back a crowd at the
foot of the tower To the ecstatic cries of the crowd a
Cross is hoisted up in its place Astride horses
COLUMBUS and the Treasurer SANTANGEL are watching the
scene

They push through an extraordinary scene The city of
Granada has just been reclaimed from the moors after
several years of siege All around them SPANISH SOLDIERS
are herding bedraggled columns of the defeated MOORS
bearing only a few possessions Ragged half-starved men
women and children

SANTANGEL
These people built Granada
Centuries ago It is a great
victory over the Moors Don Colon --
and yet what a tragedy it is

The THREE HORSEMEN pass a procession of grateful
PENITENTS who are crawling on their knees chanting
psalms and flagellating themselves At the head of the
procession HOODED PRIESTS carry a statue of the Virgin
Mary swathed in silk and lace

The gates of the Alhambra Palace are in sight

COLUMBUS
Is this a good time to meet her

SANTANGEL
It couldnt be better Victors
cant say no

Bells are pealing triumphantly The noise is tumultuous
They ride towards the magnificent palace

EXT ALHAMBRA PALACE - GARDENS - DAY

Fabulous Moorish gardens ponds filled with golden carp
exotic bird cages hang from lemon trees The distant
sounds of victory

SANTANGEL and COLUMBUS walk through the gardens escorted
by HALBERDIERS SOLDIERS pass by carrying coffers or
piles of documents

As they approach the inner sanctum however there are
fewer people They stop by the Lions Fountain where
several DIGNITARIES are waiting patiently for an audience

SANCHEZ appears They bow SANTANGEL approaches to
murmur a compliment

SANTANGEL
Your Excellency truly grateful
your help as ever

SANCHEZ protests softly and looks over at COLUMBUS a
half-smile forming on his lips Then a DUENA appears and
motions for COLUMBUS to follow

INT ALHAMBRA PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

An ornate Moorish door is pushed open by the DUENAS hand
We enter the Throne Room -- sculptured colonnades
mosaics At the far end windows open onto a view of

Granadas rooftops

Against this dazzling light the delicate silhouette of
QUEEN ISABEL OF SPAIN The light in her blonde hair
creates a halo around her head as she turns COLUMBUS
falls to his knees

ISABEL
Rise Come forward

He approaches the window stopping close to her ISABEL
scrutinizes him quickly

ISABEL
I should not even be listening to
you since my council said no But
Santangel tells me you are a man of
honor and sincerity And Sanchez
that you are not a fool

COLUMBUS
(bold)
No more than the woman who said she
would take Granada from the Moors

ISABEL smiles enjoying the lack of obsequiousness

ISABEL
The ocean is uncrossable

COLUMBUS
What did they say about Granada
before today

ISABEL
(a beat)
That she was impregnable

ISABEL smiles again

ISABEL
I cannot ignore the verdict of my
council

COLUMBUS

Surely you can do anything you want

A direct challenge She doesnt know what to make of this
man

ISABEL
How little you know

This little hint of vulnerability subtly reverses their
positions for a moment Now we sense COLUMBUS
scrutinizing her

COLUMBUS
May I speak freely
ISABEL
(with a smile)
You show no inclination to speak
otherwise

COLUMBUS
I know what I see I see someone
who doesnt accept the world as it
is Whos not afraid I seea
women who thinks What if

ISABEL
(amused at his
familiarity)
A woman

A slight pause

COLUMBUS
Forgive me but youre the only
Queen I know
She bursts out laughing
ISABEL

EXT SANCHEZS ESTATE - TREE-LINED ROAD - DAY

A chalk white road lined with trees Two liveried
SERVANTS are walking down the road one carrying a large
silver tray the other a smaller tray

They are overtaken by an ADMINISTRATOR who hurries along
the road with documents under his arm

A WOMANS HAND quietly carefully opens a cover of a spy
hole in the wall Two beautiful eyes peer through a
grille into the next room

What they see
SANCHEZ and COLUMBUS together COLUMBUS is visibly upset

SANCHEZ
(calmly)
We have considered your -- demands

expectations are excessive in
every way
COLUMBUS tightens his fists tries to remain calm

COLUMBUS
If I am right my requests are fair

SANCHEZ holds up a document

SANCHEZ

He offers the document to COLUMBUS who takes it scans it
quickly shakes his head

COLUMBUS
No
SANCHEZ
No
COLUMBUS

to take all the risks while you take
the profit No I will not be

The eyes behind the screen -- the mouth forming a little
smile

SANCHEZ
I remind you Senor Colon that you
are in no position to bargain with
me

COLUMBUS
Im not bargaining

SANCHEZ
(steely)
Then you are too ambitious

COLUMBUS leans over the table faces him

COLUMBUS
And were you never ambitious
Excellency Or is ambition only a
virtue among the nobles a fault for
the rest of us

SANCHEZ
(abrupt)
If you wont accept our proposal
well simply find someone who will

COLUMBUS smiles

COLUMBUS
If you can do that Excellency --
Ill become a monk

He turns strides towards the door We hear a WOMANS
muffled laughter

As COLUMBUS goes out ISABEL appears through a secret
door SANCHEZ bows

ISABEL goes over to the window and looks out

ISABEL
You were right Don Sanchez His
demands could never be granted

SANCHEZ
Never Your Majesty Although

She turns questioningly towards him

INT BEATRIXS HOUSE - NIGHT

COLUMBUS is sitting at the kitchen table by himself with
a glass of wine There is a movement behind him BEATRIX
is standing at the foot of the stairs in a night-shirt

COLUMBUS turns and looks at her almost sad

COLUMBUS
She said yes

BEATRIX
(moved)
Thank God

She smiles But he seems to be unable to share her
happiness

COLUMBUS
If I ever come back I swear I
will

She crosses to him quickly placing her hand gently on his
mouth

BEATRIX
(softly)
Im not asking you to swear to
anything

COLUMBUS
I dont want you to wait for me

BEATRIX
(smiling)

Thats something you cant decide

COLUMBUS kisses her

You cant go there

Turning COLUMBUS finds his son beside him

COLUMBUS
Why not

FERNANDO points at the monsters He pulls the boy to him

COLUMBUS
There arent any monsters Fernando
The only monsters are in here

Watch

He takes a pen and draws a smile on one of the terrible
monsters transforming it at once FERNANDO laughs
immediately

FERNANDO
I want to go with you

COLUMBUS
Therell be a time

FERNANDO
You promise
(Columbus nods his
head)
Do you swear on St Christopher

FERNANDO pulls the chain with the St Christopher medal
from under COLUMBUS shirt

Yes Yes I do On all of them

And he hugs his SON tightly

But COLUMBUS and DIEGO are unable to find words and
instead they clumsily hug Someone taps COLUMBUS
shoulder He turns around to see SANTANGEL Wordlessly
they hug

Activity on the ships orders are being shouted ropes
fore and aft are cast off splashing into the water Now
the SHIPS are slowly moving parallel to the quayside The
CROWD starts walking abreast to the VESSELS WOMEN
holding up babies blowing kisses old PARENTS crying

COLUMBUS suddenly unties the chain around his neck and
throws it at DIEGO

THE SANTA MARIA is now two meters from the QUAY
SANTANGEL is now opposite COLUMBUS

Take care of my investment wherever

The sea resembling a DORMANT MONSTER holding its breath
A living being all powerful capable of unpredictable
metamorphosis Music reflects the loneliness the anxiety
of the crew the fear of the unknown

ENORMOUS WHALES moving slowly alongside surging

majestically through the waves Sinking back
disappearing their cries taking precedent over the music

EXT DECK - DAY

A SHIPS BOY is throwing buckets of water on the deck

A SAILOR is busy clearing the ropes around the mast

A COOK is blowing life into a brazier in preparation of
the evening meal

TEN MEN heaving on a heavy rope raising the top sail
punctuating their efforts with a sailors chant

EXT SANTA MARIA - NIGHT

The crystalline north star -- as if seen through an
instrument

COLUMBUS silhouette by an oil lamp standing at the
prow Holding a quadrant he is aiming at the stars

SOME SAILORS are watching with curiosity One of them is
ALONSO a rough stocky Basque

Near COLUMBUS on a tressel various books and charts He
makes an entry in the log Then goes back to his
quadrant He senses MENDEZ standing next to him

COLUMBUS
(softly)
Due west Captain Mendez And may
God be with us
MENDEZ
God be with us admiral

MENDEZ doesnt move continuing to observe COLUMBUS

COLUMBUS
What is it Mendez Speak

MENDEZ is hesitant He nervously clears his throat

MENDEZ
Well Its the men Sir They
wonder how you know our position
Weve lost sight from land days
ago

COLUMBUS
(still taking
readings)
And what do you think Mendez

MENDEZ
Well I surely know what a quadrant
is But Ive never seen it used at
night before

COLUMBUS
Come over here

MENDEZ hesitates then motions to COLUMBUS The SAILORS

are watching and some approach to hear the conversation

COLUMBUS
Now find the North Star Do you
have it

The picture swims across the heavens until we see the
north star

COLUMBUS (0S)
Steady yourself Keep the plumb

line vertical

The picture steadies

MENDEZ nods -- and loses equilibrium The plumb line
swings

Dont move A mistake of one degree
and well be off 6000 leagues

MENDEZ tries again

ALONSO
How do you know land is on the
twenty eighth parallel

EXT SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

A blazing sun The ship is like a furnace its brass
fittings too hot to touch the blistering heat making the
air shimmer over the decks

Desperate for shade sailors are sheltering under the
sagging prow sail

The SHIPS BOY throws an empty bucket attached to a rope
over the side and hauls it back up again brimming with
water As he turns we see his face disfigured by a hair
lip He drenches himself From the shade ALONSO
watches him

ALONSO
Chicken-ass face

The others laugh The BOY ashamed tries to ignore them
ALONSOS hand accidentally touches a brass fitting he
reacts like he was burnt

ALONSO
Shit

He sucks his blistered fingers

ALONSO
I never seen heat like this Not
even in Las Minas

SAILOR
The waters going putrid in the
barrels

ALONSO
Youll be drinking your own piss
For the glory of Spain and
Admiral Colon Bastard

The SHIPS BOY glances round at them

ALONSO
What are you listening to chicken
ass

SAILOR
Ah leave him alone Hes doing no
harm

ALONSO
With a face like that

(to boy)

I dont want you looking at me You
hear

The BOY turns away dropping the bucket back into the sea

ALONSO
Hes the devils child

SAILOR
Well all go crazy

The BOY throws more water over the deck A SAILOR takes
his guitar and starts singing an improvised song

SAILOR
Culo de galina es el hijo del
demonio (Chicken ass mouth is the
devils child Born from the loins

of a stinky old goat etc)
They all laugh The BOY hearing this climbs to the
crows-nest like a monkey
EXT SANTA MARIA - RIGGING AND CROWS-NEST - DAY

We experience a sense of vertigo as we near the top of the
main mast high above the rolling deck

The BOY curls like a fetus in the swinging crows-nest
exhausted by the heat and scared His eyes are turning
white He begins to piss himself

EXT SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

Piss is dripping on the deck THE SAILORS do not seem to
care THE COOK takes a chicken from a cage He breaks
its neck and starts plucking it The OTHERS continue

SAILOR
We left three weeks ago Alonso
Cant be that near

Cant be that far I say Also I
dont like the smell of the sea

Bad sign

The COOK starts laughing They turn to him
COOK
(shaking his head)
Of course it smells like it Thats
why sailors take to the sea
They all laugh Alonso looks up at COLUMBUS standing on
the poop deck scrutinizing the horizon waiting for the
land to appear
ALONSO
And why does this one take to the
sea Nobody knows Never says a

word

MENDEZ has sensed the danger of this lack of respect He
approaches them

MENDEZ
To your post At once

They split in silence

EXT SANTA MARIA - DECK - NIGHT

The SHIP is plowing on pushed by a hot wind -- SAILORS
sleep on deck

The SHIPS BOY is singing to himself Despite his hair
lip he has a pure melancholy voice

COLUMBUS leaning over the prow rail staring ahead hears
it carry over the darkness

EXT SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

CLOSE UP ON AN HOUR-GLASS nearly through its time

The SHIPS BOY throws an ampoulette over board We
follow the bulb attached to a rope passing the full
length of the hull As it reaches the poop deck another
SAILOR shouts MARK A very primitive system of
calculation for distance and speed

Sitting near the SHIPS BOY COLUMBUS is making entries in
a log-book watching the hourglass

SHIPS BOY
Mark Twenty nine Sir

THE HOUR-GLASS runs out COLUMBUS converts the mark into
a daily average for distance and speed

COLUMBUS
Six hundred and twenty nine

THE SHIPS BOY cups his hands to his mouth to shout

EXT PINTA - DAY

PINZON his OFFICERS beside him looks across at the SANTA

Continue rowing

ALONSO defiantly stares at MENDEZ He then starts to beat
a rhythm on the hull with his fist followed by the
others In the two other boats the MEN begin to follow

COLUMBUS moves to the door As an afterthought he takes
his scarlet-embroidered jacket from a hook

EXT SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

Most of the men are now back on board
They go silent as COLUMBUS appears He walks slowly over
to them All including ALONSO are surly threatening

COLUMBUS
Who gave you the order to come on
board

He looks up and down the line finishing on ALONSO They
stare at one another

ALONSO
God doesnt want us to cross the
ocean This voyage is cursed

Some of the MEN murmur their agreement

COLUMBUS
Cursed

ALONSO
We set sail for greed God has
abandoned us The voyage is cursed
There are signs

ALONSO glances towards the SHIPS BOY with his hair lip
The BOY lowers his eyes COLUMBUS moves towards him
pulls him forward stands him in front of ALONSO

COLUMBUS
This boy has the voice of an angel
What comes out of his mouth is
blessed Alonso What comes out of
your is evil

Some of the men laugh at this statement ALONSO is ill at
ease COLUMBUS pauses looks around at all the MEN

COLUMBUS

Listen to me Every man is afraid
who does something for the first
time But those who overcome their
fears will find their rewards I
do not know if it is Gods will that
we cross this ocean -- but I am
certain it is the devil who puts
fears into our hearts

The MEN are listening We sense a subtle change of
mood

COLUMBUS
This jacket to the first man who
sights land I want a man up that
mast day and night

COLUMBUS points at the SHIPS BOY
COLUMBUS
You start first

The SHIPS BOY rushes up the mast As he climbs the
mainsail starts to fill with wind The deck begins to
move under their feet

This movement under their feet seems to imperceptibly
erase the fears and the angers

MENDEZ
Alonso Jaime Dont let this wind
escape us

CRIES from the other ships as the sails snap taut
filling with wind MEN rush to their posts PINZON
stares at COLUMBUS shaking his head in disbelief

PINZON
(murmuring)
You lucky bastard

COLUMBUS walks away to his cabin then turning back to
PINZON

COLUMBUS
Pinzon the more I sail the luckier
I get

Turning abruptly he enters his cabin

EXT SANTA MARIA - PROW - MISTY NIGHT

COLUMBUS is seated isolated at the prow wrapped in his
cape struggling against the sleep MENDEZ approaches him
with a bowl of soup

MENDEZ
Shall I take my turn

COLUMBUS shakes his head no and starts drinking from the
bowl

COLUMBUS head nods lower and lower to his chest He is
asleep We become aware of a sharp buzzing sound It
becomes louder as we move closer to COLUMBUS face

A mosquito lands on his temple COLUMBUS reflexively
slaps it He wakes up and looks at his fingers -- a spot
of blood a crushed mosquito He stares at it for a
moment Then slowly gets to his feet

EXT SANTA MARIA - DECK - NIGHT

CuT TO
In the luminous moonlight COLUMBUS is standing staring
up at thousands of insects that wheel around the mast
lantern We hear the flutter of their wings and see the
bats as they swoop and dive in a feeding frenzy

COLUMBUS turns stares into the darkness desperate to see
the land that must be close

He kneels by MENDEZ wrapped in a blanket He touches his
shoulder

MENDEZ grimaces and opens one eye

COLUMBUS

EXT SHIP - DAWN

An opaque dawn COLUMBUS riveted staring forward as if
to pierce the mist The entire crew are clinging to the
vail and standing on the shrouds

Suddenly the SHIP BOYS voice cracking with emotion

SHIPS BOY
TIERRA TIERRA

COLUMBUS strains his eyes he still can not see anything

The entire CREW stand and stare silent holding their
breath

As the sun begins to rise the fog dissipates -- slowly
exquisitely revealing a single palm so close it seems
almost as though they could touch it Then a white slash
of beach

Near COLUMBUS a SAILOR falls to his knees and burst into
tears Others laugh with joy COLUMBUS watches this
vision in disbelief his mouth open as if it were
difficult for him to breathe Tears come to his eyes He
closes them Then opens them again The land is there --
a green paradise

On screen the words OCTOBER 12 1942 GUANAHAN ISLAND

EXT BOATS - DAY

Three row boats plunging through the surf towards the

CuT TO
beach COLUMBUS stands in the prow of the first boat

MENDEZ is in the second PINZON the third They stare
entranced at the lushness of the foliage and the blue

clarity of the water

As the first boat beaches COLUMBUS leaps out and wades
ashore Behind him the rest of the landing party splash
through the sun-dazzled water carrying the banner of
Castille and Aragon

EXT BEACH - DAY

They stand on the beach almost in a dream There is
silence The ROYAL NOTARY ludicrously overdressed now
wet through stumbles over to COLUMBUS and holds out his
contract and a pen COLUMBUS scrawls his name

The MEN stare at him filled not only with new respect
but with something amounting to awe

COLUMBUS turns to them tries to speak

COLUMBUS
By the by the Grace of God

He swallows Tears have sprung to his eyes He is so
moved he cannot continue Coming to his rescue -- THE
SHIPS BOY starts to roll the drum He then stops

COLUMBUS

(pulling himself

together)
In the name of their Gracious
Majesties of Castille and Aragon
and by all the powers vested in me
I claim this island and name it San
Salvador

The MEN cheer as the flags are rammed into the sand
flapping in the wind

COLUMBUS starts to walk towards the jungle and in silence
the rest follow

EXT JUNGLE - DAY

Immediately they are met by an incredible wall of SOUND
The jungle is filled with NOISE The impossibly-loud
CRIES of EXOTIC BIRDS the CHATTERING of MONKEYS The
SPANIARDS are overwhelmed

They move forward Rays of sunlight pierce through the
high canopy of leaves like the roof of a magnificent
cathedral The sounds and smells intoxicate their senses
They are filled with wonder
Then PINZON stops He has seen something Another stops
then a third staring ahead of them

MENDEZ
(whispering
urgently)
Arquebuses

Several of them raise their weapons to their shoulders
pointing them into the jungle

From COLUMBUS POV we slowly scan the face of the thick
jungle ahead For a moment we dont see anything -- and
then with a shock we see the first INDIAN Naked
painted like an idol carrying a hunting lance

As if they had materialized from nowhere the rest of the
HUNTING PARTY with their bows and spears Silent
Watchful They stare back at us

The SPANIARDS nervously finger their weapons

COLUMBUS slowly lifts his hand into the air a clear
signal not to fire Then removing his sword he drops it
on the ground and starts to walk forward fixing his gaze
upon the first INDIAN he saw

PINZON
(warningly)
Colon

COLUMBUS ignores him even though some of the INDIANS have
raised their weapons He stops in the no-mans land
between them The INDIANS dont move -- but something
excites them

The SHIPS BOY wearing COLUMBUS embroidered jacket and
the drum has followed COLUMBUS and now stands close to
him He is the cause of their interest COLUMBUS puts
his arm around the BOY and this gesture of affection
seems to put the INDIANS at their ease They start
talking and pointing They come forward slowly start to
tentatively touch the BOYS jacket Then now laughing
they touch COLUMBUS pulling at his beard COLUMBUS
laughs too

Sensing their innocence the rest of the MEN lower their
weapons Some of them laugh

An apparition a beautiful young INDIAN GIRL totally
naked walks out of the jungle

She is pregnant and holds a child We begin to hear
Indian music played on a flute

curt TO
EXT INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY

A large post is lifted from the ground by two SPANIARDS
pulling on ropes The post is fixed into position -- and
then we see that it is a large wooden cross The INDIAN
VILLAGERS watch the ceremony with some interest and
amusement

COLUMBUS looks over at the men and gestures at the
INDIANS

COLUMBUS
We have come here in peace and we
will behave with honor They are
not savages and neither will you be
Treat these people as you would your
own wives and your own children
Neither are you free to take what
you will for a seashell you give a
bandana You will respect their
beliefs Pillage will be punished
by the whip Rape by the sword

EXT VILLAGE - SUNSET

The smoke from fires Laughter Music playing The
INDIANS have prepared food for the SPANIARDS who are
drinking and enjoying themselves in this strange world

COLUMBUS sits with MENDEZ PINZON the INDIAN CHIEF
ELDERS OF THE VILLAGE Other INDIANS stand around
smiling curious

The INDIANS talk among themselves The ELDERS smoke
primitive cigars -- and offer them with good humor to
their guests The SPANIARDS cough and choke at first
and laugh In return they offer the INDIANS wine

Dogs roam around the campfires The WOMEN openly suckle
their babies The MEN are entranced

PINZON draws out attention for the first time to a small
gold ornament on the nose of one of the INDIANS He
points to it indicates his interest in it

PINZON
Gold Gold

The INDIANS says the word in his own language laughing
We see that some of the other INDIANS also have small gold
ornaments

PINZON repeats the INDIAN word for gold The INDIAN
removes the ornament from his nose gives it to PINZON
who indicates that he wants to have it The INDIAN nods
-- but points to PINZONS dagger indicating that he wants
it in return PINZON shakes his head stops the INDIAN
from taking it

COLUMBUS
(to Pinzon)
Give it to him

PINZON looks at him about to argue -- but COLUMBUS
insists PINZON takes out the dagger and offers it to the
INDIAN

PINZON
(irritated)
By God Thats the worst trade of
my life

His friends laugh Innocently the INDIAN has taken it by
the blade He yelps looks down at the blood welling

up A moment of tension Then MENDEZ laughs at his
clumsiness and the ELDERS laugh too and the INDIAN
laughs

Just outside this circle we see the first INDIAN we saw
squatting on his haunches watching This is UTAPAN

INT TENT - DAWN

The first light outside -- the strange wonderful sounds
of the jungle all around COLUMBUS writes in his journal

COLUMBUS (VO)
October 21st 1492 I think we have
returned to Eden Surely this is
how the world once was before the
beginning of time I believe no man
will ever see this land again as we
do for the first time

He looks up UTAPAN is squatting in the doorway of the
hut Hes been there all night COLUMBUS takes more ink
on his quill and begins to sketch UTAPANS face in the
margin of his log-book He draws well

He gets up and walks over to UTAPAN and shows him the
drawing Its an electrifying moment UTAPAN is shocked
and amazed At first he is rather frightened of his own
image Then he is happy and laughs and COLUMBUS
laughs with him and puts a hand on his shoulder ina
gesture of friendship

UTAPAN gets up and indicates that he too has something he
wishes to offer

EXT JUNGLE - MORNING
TO

UTAPAN expertly scampering through the jungle COLUMBUS
follows him

UTAPAN orders COLUMBUS to sit COLUMBUS obeys UTAPAN
looks up at the tops of the trees The sun is rising and
filters through the foliage As if the time had come
UTAPAN stands up and COLUMBUS does the same

A gap in the dense vegetation Something is glittering
Gold A mass of gold As they approach COLUMBUS
discovers --

A large pool of fresh water The morning sunlight has
turned the water into liquid gold The surface ripples
with the breeze UTAPAN smiles It the stranger
satisfied Isnt this what he came for

COLUMBUS plunges into the pool As he emerges he fills
his palms with liquid gold

DISSOLVE

EXT RIVER - DAY
Wide shot -- A flotilla of canoes are going upstream

canoes UTAPAN leads the expedition in COLUMBUS craft
THE SHIP BOYS cranium is shaved like UTAPANS and we
notice that some other crew members are beardless some
even wearing tribal patterns

EXT RIVERSIDE - DAY

INDIAN VILLAGERS confronting the SPANIARDS UTAPAN talks
to an ELDER MAN watched by COLUMBUS MENDEZ and PINZON

EXT SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

Standing at the prow of the ship his long dark hair
floating in the wind UTAPAN rejoicing at the speed

EXT THICK JUNGLE - CUBA - DAY

Led by UTAPAN the SPANIARDS hack their way through thick
jungle Its hard work The MEN sweat This is
inhospitable terrain Even the noises of the jungle seem
somehow more sinister

RESTING PLACE - ALONSO is seated under a tree He takes
off his boot and grabs his foot examining the blisters
on his toes As he puts his foot back into the boot he
jumps screaming in pain

ALONSO yelps grasping his ankle
CLOSE ON a snake sliding out of the empty boot

While his COMPANIONS rush to him a SAILOR spots the
snake and decapitates it with his sword UTAPAN glances
at the dead snake He then goes and kneels -- he sees the
bite on ALONSOS ankle

COLUMBUS
Help him

ALONSO is quiet and silent His eyes are looking around
at his companions UTAPAN shakes his head There is
nothing he can do

ALONSO is now leaning back supported by one of his
friends He has grabbed the forearm of a SAILOR His

look is already far away His companion shouts at UTAPAN

SAILOR
Do something Help him

UTAPAN
He dead

ALONSO starts convulsing HIS FRIENDS hold him desperate
in their helplessness Others simply move away
horrified One of them cries

EXT RIVER - DAY

Standing in the stream up to his thighs A SPANIARD (a

CuT TO
gold expert) examines some stones He then looks up at
COLUMBUS and PINZON and just throws the stones back into
the water without a word

The group of SPANIARDS are resting exhausted by the
humidity Some are drinking from the river others soak
bandanas and tie them around their necks

One after another they stand up slowly -- they look
discouraged tired and beaten

EXT MOUNTAINOUS JUNGLE - DAY

UTAPAN and the SPANIARDS are trekking in the hills Fully
armed they are now suffering intensely from the heat and
the vicious insect bites

COLUMBUS doggedly keeps up with UTAPAN who tirelessly
trots forward

Finally COLUMBUS turns around and sees nobody He
calls out to UTAPAN

COLUMBUS
Utapan Wait

UTAPAN stops obediently and rushes back to COLUMBUS with
comical energy

On their way back they find one SOLDIER sitting leaning
against a tree He has removed his helmet His hair
sticking to his forehead

As COLUMBUS and UTAPAN walk back they find another
SAILOR then another then the whole group gathered around
PINZON Ashen he burns with fever He attempts a smile

PINZON
Well Youll have to continue
without me
COLUMBUS looks around him -- what he sees exhausted men

and jungle as far as one can see

COLUMBUS
No Its enough What would you
say to a drop of Jerez Pinzon

PINZON grins

PINZON
And a nice slice of Santa Fe lamb
Id sell my soul for it
(to his officer)
Help me up Ive got to piss gold
They all laugh as the OFFICER helps PINZON to his feet

PINZON walks a few yards into the jungle -- starts to
urinate It is red Suddenly dizzy he reels and
collapses

EXT JUNGLE - DAY

A line of SPANIARDS and INDIANS threading their way down a
mountainside PINZON is being carried on a makeshift
stretcher His eyes are closed his face thick with
sweat

They enter a village to the surprise of the INDIANS
UTAPAN once again at the front as the ambassador

INT HUT - NIGHT

A INDIAN SHAMAN is forcing a milky fluid into PINZONS
mouth COLUMBUS attempts a gesture to prevent him But
UTAPAN stops him

UTAPAN
He cures

COLUMBUS nods -- he obviously trusts UTAPAN

INT CHIEF GUARIONEXS HUT - NIGHT

In the half-light figures wreathed in smoke -- COLUMBUS
MENDEZ and UTAPAN watch the CHIEF GUARIONEX putting a
Spanish helmet on his head The helmet is too big almost
covering his eyes The ELDERS appraise the gift with
solemn wonder

In return GUARIONEX hands COLUMBUS a parcel made of
leaves COLUMBUS unwraps them Inside a GOLD grimacing
mask The first real piece of gold COLUMBUS is unable
to conceal his excitement at this first real evidence of
the metal

He waits for the CHIEF to speak but the CHIEF only looks
at him On the ground we see other presents offered by
the SPANIARDS -- trinkets and necklaces

UTAPAN
(to Columbus)
You come You speak first

COLUMBUS
Tell the Chief we thank him

UTAPAN
Chief knows
COLUMBUS
Tell him his country is very
beautiful Tell him we are leaving
men here -- to build a fort

UTAPAN translates
COLUMBUS
Tell him we will return very soon

Many of us

UTAPAN translates The CHIEF GUARIONEX asks a simple
question

UTAPAN
Chief says -- how many

COLUMBUS
Thousands

UTAPAN
Why

COLUMBUS doesnt seem to understand the question For the
first time he seems to be caught short

COLUMBUS
To bring the word of God

UTAPAN
Chief says -- he has a God
COLUMBUS
(pursuing)

and also to bring medicine

UTAPAN
Chief says
COLUMBUS
(interrupting)
He has medicine
(pause)

Tell him we admire his people
UTAPAN translates

UTAPAN
Chief says he knows you like his
(searches for the
word)
Women

And the CHIEF gets up awards COLUMBUS with a smile and
walks out of the hut the ELDERS following leaving
COLUMBUS alone
COLUMBUS
(with a little
smile)
Thats a beginning

EXT SHORE - DAY

Watched from the shore by the INDIANS and by about forty
of the SPANIARDS who are staying behind the boats pull
out towards the two remaining ships

PINZON is laid out in the bottom of the boat COLUMBUS
UTAPAN and four other INDIANS are in the same boat

COLUMBUS (VO)
March 1493 Thirty nine of my men
volunteered to stay behind God
willing we will be back in less than
a year

The boats continue to pull away the figures on the shore
growing smaller

EXT COLUMBUS CABIN - NIGHT

CLOSE ON a golden mask the lamp in the cabin swings
violently back and forth creating strange shadows as if
the mask was alive COLUMBUS is writing with difficulty

in his log-book

COLUMBUS (VO)
Several men are ill We did not
find signs of civilization No
cities no temples Nothing that
resembles Marco Polos descriptions
My ships are not filled with the
spices and the gold that Spain was
hoping for But this land
intoxicates the senses like the
strongest of perfumes And all I
can think of is to return to these
untamed lands

Suddenly the cabin seems to lurch over Things fall from
the table smashing on the floor COLUMBUS nearly falls

EXT SEA - NIGHT

We are in the middle of a violent storm -- of terrifying
proportions The thunder is deafening Light irradiates
the darkness We see the two caravels dwarfed by the
massive seas

CuT TO
EXT DECK - NIGHT

Five MEN are struggling to lash down the tiller The deck
jumps and rolls It rises five meters into the air then
falls into space and hits the water with a terrible crack
Waves sweep over the decks We hear desperate cries for
mercy from the terrified crew loud enough to be heard
above the storm

COLUMBUS and MENDEZ are crawling towards the mast along a
lifeline

COLUMBUS
(screaming to the
sailors)
Get below All of you Go

The MEN start to scramble below decks

COLUMBUS
(to Mendez)
Stay with me

The ship rolls again COLUMBUS and MENDEZ crawl towards
the mast Another gigantic wave crashes over them tons
of water falling like cement They reach the mast The
wood groans

COLUMBUS
We may have to cut it

MENDEZ nods COLUMBUS grabs some rope The ship rises
into the air again crashes down the deck disappearing
beneath them for a moment

COLUMBUS
(screaming out)
Ill stay here -- to decide if we
cut it Help me

With MENDEZS help COLUMBUS is tied to the mast one
rope under his arms the other around his waist MENDEZ

hands him a horn

COLUMBUS
(screaming)
Now go

MENDEZ seems to hesitate COLUMBUS screams at him again

COLUMBUS
I said -- below deck Mendez

MENDEZ crawls away
Another huge wave washes over COLUMBUS He emerges
almost suffocated The storm rages its eerie light
making it seem at times like bright daylight But as the
lightning flashes COLUMBUS begins to count

COLUMBUS
One two three four
Theres an enormous thunderclap on four -- it indicates

how close they are to the eye of the storm

The ship keels over again dropping down and down seeming
never to rise COLUMBUS lifts his head to the heavens
screams out

COLUMBUS
Damn you

As if in answer another flash of lightning that
illuminates the sky and the sea COLUMBUS starts counting
again

COLUMBUS
One two three four
five
Another terrible clap of thunder on five -- COLUMBUS

starts laughing knowing the storm is moving on

Then in the strange light something seems to move
through the air towards him it looks like some kind of
projectile a craft with a trail of vapor

COLUMBUS stares up at it amazed We start to hear the
Te Deum majestic and heavenly

INT CATHEDRAL OF CORDOBA - SPAIN - DAY

COLUMBUS looks up at the vast roof to see an incense
burner swinging gliding swiftly across the ceiling
trailing a think vapor of incense

A magnificent Te Deum is being sung -- in honor of
COLUMBUS achievements and return The whole cathedral is
packed with nobles and dignitaries in their gorgeous
robes

BEATRIX FERNANDO and DIEGO are staring in fascination at
COLUMBUS triumph -- somewhat separated by the grandeur of
this occasion COLUMBUS passes by walking proudly down
the long central alley beside KING FERDINAND and QUEEN
ISABEL and other GRANDEES He turns to his family
keeping his eyes on BEATRIX until she is out of his
vision

CuT TO
The procession is followed by UTAPAN and other INDIANS in
tribal regalia

As they move through the crowds all eyes are upon
COLUMBUS

INT ROOM - SEVILLE (PINZONS DEATH) - DAY

In a simple room a PRIEST finishes giving the Last Rites
and a sheet is pulled over the head of MARTIN PINZON His
WIFE and CHILDREN weep at the bedside

INT CATHEDRAL - DAY

A stool passes from hands to hands It is placed at the
Queen and Kings side COLUMBUS sits on it -- a supreme
privilege

To one side sit AROJAZ and SANCHEZ AROJAZ leans over to
whisper to him

AROJAZ
It wont be easy to get rid of your
prophet now Don Sanchez

SANCHEZ
(whispering)
On the contrary Your Eminence It
seems to me the man is preparing his
own cross

INT ALCAZARS PALACE IN SEVILLE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON the face of a young SPANISH NOBLEMAN ADRIAN
DE MOXICA Hesitantly he brings a lighted cigar to his
lips -- then pauses

We discover other people around the magnificent candle-lit
table NOBLE MEN and NOBLE WOMEN SANCHEZ COLUMBUS
QUEEN ISABEL

COLUMBUS takes the cigar from MOXICA The rest watch him
with rapt curiosity COLUMBUS inhales deeply then to
their astonishment blows out the smoke through his nose

COLUMBUS
You must not inhale but simply
allow the palate to enjoy the flavor
of the Tobacco

He hands the cigar back to MOXICA With a casual air
MOXICA himself inhales deeply -- almost chokes to death

CuT TO

CuT TO
He gulps down a glass of wine much to the amusement of
the others

MOXICA
(deeply embarrassed)
And you say this is an Indian vice
By God I dont see any kind of
pleasure that would make this a sin

COLUMBUS
The Indians have no such word Don
Moxica

ISABEL

Do they have such thoughts

COLUMBUS
They come and go as naked as the day
God created them

ISABEL blushes slightly

COLUMBUS

They dont see sin in their
nakedness They live according to
nature in a never ending summer
The islands are covered with trees
filled with blossoms and fruits
And

SANCHEZ
(interrupting)
Forgive me Don Colon But what
about gold

COLUMBUS nods turns and whispers something to a SERVANT
standing just behind his chair The SERVANT goes to open
the door -- and in comes UTAPAN dressed as a tribesman
carrying a casket The WOMEN around the table fan
themselves furiously at the sight UTAPAN puts the casket
down in front of the QUEEN and steps back

COLUMBUS
These are gifts for Your Majesty

ISABEL opens the casket revealing the gleam of gold
inside She takes out some of the little golden
ornaments a bracelet and then the mask

She holds it somehow moved by its crude beauty

ISABEL raises the mask to her face looking across at
COLUMBUS

The image is somehow powerful enough to reduce even the
ARISTOCRATS to silence She speaks from behind the mask
ISABEL
We are more than gratified

The guests laugh obsequiously COLUMBUS bows a little --
looks up and meets the eyes of SANCHEZ who is staring at
him coldly

INT ROTUNDA - DAY

A SWORD MASTER advances towards us with determination his
sword flashing He is fighting an adversary we do not
see and comments his movements

MASTER
Si Si Muy bien Excellente
(Yes Yes Good Excellent

We discover the SWORD MASTER is fencing with COLUMBUS A
dozen duellists are practicing in the magnificent rotunda
surrounded with a two-tiered colonnade

Out of breath COLUMBUS stops the exercise and removes
his protective canvas padding He bows at his teacher
who salutes him in return

COLUMBUS walks to a tressel laden with food and beverages
SANCHEZ in a fencing outfit and boots is having a glass

of wine Upon seeing COLUMBUS approaching he hands him a
glass

SANCHEZ
You defend yourself admirably

COLUMBUS
for a commoner

SANCHEZ laughs and raises his glass

SANCHEZ
To your second expedition

They drink A short somewhat ugly man with some kind of
imposing energy approach them

SANCHEZ
Don Colon -- Don Alonso de
Bobadilla A man who knows our
laws
BOBADILLA bows
BOBADILLA

I understand that you will soon be
appointing Governors for the
islands Is it not so
COLUMBUS
Forgive me Don Bobadilla -- those
positions have already been taken

BOBADILLA
(disappointed)
May I ask by whom

COLUMBUS
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon

SANCHEZ looks at him in surprise BOBADILLA reddens

BOBADILLA
I trust they are men of quality

BOBADILLA glances at SANCHEZ

COLUMBUS
But we do have a lack of notaries
You should contact my
administration

SANCHEZ
(amused)
Don Bobadilla is already a judge my
Dear Don Cristobal

COLUMBUS
Good We are also in need of
judges Except there are no
thieves

A grin disfigures the face of BOBADILLA

BOBADILLA
(to Sanchez)
I see I was mistaken Don Colon
has no need for my services

And he walks off SANCHEZ fills his mouth with a slice of
ham

SANCHEZ
(amused)
You seem to have a special talent
for making friends

COLUMBUS
What Do I have so many already

SANCHEZ
(seriously)
To rise so high in so short a time
is a dangerous occupation
(kindly)
A little hypocrisy goes a long way
INT ROOM - ADMINISTRATION - DAY

COLUMBUS with two MEN the oldest around thirty is a
strong-looking man The youngest no more than twenty
five is thin and fit There is obvious tension in the
room These are BARTOLOME and GIACOMO COLON COLUMBUS

GIACOMO

afraid of We are living what we
always dreamt of

GIACOMO
You know I never shared those dreams
with you

COLUMBUS

BARTOLOME
(amused)
You bastard you always had your
own way
COLUMBUS

Let me show you something
He opens the door to a terrace
CUT TO

EXT GALLERY - DAY

The large gallery courtyard is crowded with PEOPLE --
applicants for the voyage As COLUMBUS appears they all
press forward calling out his name trying to get his
attention touching his sleeves as if he were a saint
They crowd around COLUMBUS and his BROTHERS COLUMBUS
nods murmurs vaguely here and there

COLUMBUS
Of course Of course Well see
to it Yes Thank you Soon

Soon
Fighting their way through the BOTHERS press their way
reaching the other side of the gallery We get glimpses
of the incredible activity down below ADMINISTRATORS
MILITARIES MERCHANTS are busy around tressels covered
with documents plans maps preparing the second
expedition

COLUMBUS puts his arms around them

COLUMBUS

(indicating the

applicants)
Now -- you tell me Who can I
trust

(almost amused)
Were brothers We must be a House
A bloodline In this country one
cant exist alone I need you
Both of you

He walks then to the balustrade The cries from the
courtyard down below subside some of the applicants
begin to look up aware of his presence

SOLDIER
Where is the Admiral Has anyone
seen the Admiral

Everybody laughs

COLUMBUS
He is here What is it

He leans over the balcony In the middle of the
overcrowded courtyard the SOLDIER who was shouting is
brandishing a document

MAN
Admiral The horses have arrived

COLUMBUS
I know I saw them Who did we
hire today

ANOTHER ASSISTANT raises his eyes

ASSISTANT
Thirty blacksmiths twenty eight
halberdiers twenty carpenters a

Hes growing up

BEATRIX smiles nods They walk on

COLUMBUS
Beatrix I want to ask you
something

BEATRIX

(with a smile)
You dont usually ask

COLUMBUS

(after a pause)
I can arrange for the Queen to take
Fernando and Diego into her service

BEATRIX stops in her tracks looks at him

COLUMBUS
It is a great honor We could not
hope for anything better

BEATRIX nods but bites her lip and looks back at
FERNANDO

BEATRIX
For once I wish you werent right

COLUMBUS puts his arm around her waist pulling her
closer they move away

EXT FAR END OF THE ORANGERY - DAY

FERNANDO is now swinging expertly in the hammock UTAPAN
is pushing him gently He slowly straightens up to watch
COLUMBUS and BEATRIX disappear somehow sensing there is a
dilemma FERNANDO noticing UTAPANS reaction turns to
his parents The arbor is empty FERNANDO becomes
pensive

We become aware of the rustling of the jungle
SLOW
DISSOLVE TO

EXT BEACH AND EDGE OF JUNGLE - DAY

FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEN spread along the beach looking
towards the jungle COLUMBUS stands beside his BROTHERS
and MENDEZ and UTAPAN

MOXICA astride a magnificent black horse prances back
and forth across the sand All are waiting

A signal cannon is fired from one of the ships Birds

scatter into the air from the jungle -- but then silence
complete and ominous COLUMBUS stares into the jungle
Nothing No one to greet them -- no welcoming party from

the MEN they left behind

COLUMBUS glances at MENDEZ

MENDEZ looks at him but cant answer

MOXICA suddenly spurs on his horse and guides it into the

trees The order is given for the rest to follow fanning
out as they do so weapons at the ready

EXT CLEARING - JUNGLE - DAY

Ruins The camp has been burned to ashes A strange
sight arrows are stuck vertically into the ground each
with a moldering tuft of human hair attached to the
flight

In silence the SOLDIERS pick their way through the
devastation

The ground is littered with coconuts Kicking one over
with his shoe a SOLDIER discovers that his coconut is
actually a human skull The gaping mouth has been filled
to the brim with gold

But of the living there is no sign

MOXICA
Is this your new world Don Colon

COLUMBUS looks around in dismay A YOUNG NOBLEMAN
HERNANDO DE GUEVARA takes out his sword

GUEVARA
These animals should be shown what
savagery can be

Other SPANIARDS join in repeating this last word

NOBLEMAN
Three heads for every life taken
No mercy before God

GUEVARA
No mercy Lets find them

COLUMBUS
No Guevara There will be no
revenge

Silence Everyone looks at COLUMBUS

MOXICA
We lost cousins friends We will
wash this in blood

COLUMBUS
If you want to keep your head on
your shoulders youll do as I say

They are all listening

COLUMBUS
Moxica I lost friends too Thirty
nine brave men who trusted me

He walks among them

COLUMBUS
You want a war Fine We are a
thousand They outnumber us by ten
Who will you kill Which tribe

MOXICA
We dont need to know

COLUMBUS

We came here to stay To build

Not to start a crusade In this
forest there is enough danger to
sweep us away in days So we will
be brave and swallow our grief And
in the name of those who died we
will accomplish what we came for

EXT INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY

MOXICA mounted on his magnificent BLACK STALLION canters
to the edge of the deserted village and enters the
village UTAPAN is terrorized by the absence of anything
living

All we can hear is the breathing of the horse The
animal an impressive mass of muscle prances nervously

UTAPAN calls out in dialect
UTAPAN
They here

Slowly they begin to appear one after the other --
materializing from the jungle Shy and scared

They stare at this Centaur (the HORSE and the HORSEMAN
seem to be one -- a God)

To impress them even more MOXICA makes the beast move
sideways and backwards rearing its front hoofs pawing
the air THE INDIANS retreat in terror except for one
who stands his ground brandishing his lance

UTAPAN encourages the YOUNG WARRIOR to approach the
centaur He places his hand onto the shoulder of the
animal The muscles shudder THE INDIAN jumps back
comically accompanied by the rest of the tribe

Without warning MOXICA climbs down from the saddle More
INDIANS step back in fear and absolute astonishment Now
more have ventured from the jungle The bravest of them
approach MOXICA daring to touch him and the horse
retreating then touching until they fill the compound

At this moment COLUMBUS and his SOLDIERS appear all
around them pointing their muskets and their crossbows

A moment of tension

COLUMBUS walks forward towards the CHIEF (GUARIONEX) we
meet before

COLUMBUS
Ask the Chief what happened to my
men
The CHIEF answers
UTAPAN
Another tribe made war on them

came by sea took them away

BROTHER BUYL
God have mercy on their souls

MOXICA
The monkey is lying

A pause The SPANIARDS shifting eager for blood

MOXICA
We should kill them Don Colon

UTAPAN looks anxiously at COLUMBUS

COLUMBUS
No youll do it my way

(to Utapan)
Tell the Chief we will not harm his
people even though we have the
power to do it

UTAPAN translates The CHIEF listens in silence

COLUMBUS
We will work with his people We
want peace Ask the Chief if he
understands

UTAPAN
He understands

COLUMBUS
Ask him if he will help

EXT WATERMILL AND DAM UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY

It is raining hard COLUMBUS is floundering in the mud
supervising a mixed work-force of SPANISH and INDIANS
They are attempting to raise the huge wheel of a
watermill

Despite COLUMBUS shouts of encouragement its clear the
wheel is far too heavy and the mud too deep

Close by on horseback MOXICA watches the scene
COLUMBUS plastered with wet mud clambers out of the pit

and approaches him

COLUMBUS
Don Moxica -- we need your horse

MOXICA looks down at the sodden dirty figure

COLUMBUS
We cant raise the wheel without it

MOXICA
My horse doesnt work

A beat COLUMBUS wipes some mud from his eyes

COLUMBUS

Don Moxica -- we all have to work
MOXICA

You did not hear me Don Colon Not

my horse

He starts to turn away COLUMBUS grabs hold of the reins

CuT TO
COLUMBUS
Forgive me Don Moxica But it was
your horse I was talking about

A beat MOXICA stares down at an equally determined
COLUMBUS Then in front of everyone MOXICA has to
dismount and suffer the disgrace of it

COLUMBUS
Thank you Don Moxica

COLUMBUS leads the horse away

EXT WATERMILL AND DAM UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY

Harnessed the horse pulls with COLUMBUS and the MEN
The wheel is raised into position

EXT WATERMILL AND DAM - DAY

Water thundering into the new canal The huge wheel
begins to turn The MEN cheer and congratulate each
other MOXICA looks at his mud-splattered and foaming
horse his eyes full of hatred

EXT CITY OF ISABEL - TWILIGHT

A wide high shot of the new City dominated by a huge
wooden cross -- no more than a muddy main street bordered
by a hundred bamboo and stone shanties with candles
burning in the doorways A main square with the
Governors Mansion and the foundations of a church

In the twilight COLUMBUS and the other WORKERS returning
dirty and tired

EXT VERANDA OF MOXICAS HOUSE - TWILIGHT

MOXICA and GUEVARA sit out on the veranda watching the
MEN return MOXICA raises his glass in an ironic salute

MOXICA
To the Governor of the Mosquitoes

They laugh We see the smoke and flames from a fire
Four or five INDIANS are squatting on the earth nearby
cooking for them talking quietly in their own language

MOXICA calls out something in their language and a naked
YOUNG INDIAN GIRL comes out of the house bringing more
wine GUEVARA stares at her lasciviously MOXICA

CuT TO

CuT TO
letting his hand casually brush against her flank smiles
at him

MOXICA
Do you want her

He turns the GIRL round so that GUEVARA can admire her
properly GUEVARA nods MOXICA lets the GIRL go with a
peremptory order and she disappears back inside

GUEVARA suddenly stands up -- unsteadily -- and sweeping
his arm round in a broad gesture says ironically

GUEVARA
To the new world my friend To the
new world

INT DINING ROOM - GOVERNORS MANSION - NIGHT

In an already Spanish-colonel dining room COLUMBUS is
having dinner with his brothers BARTOLOME and GIACOMO

served by an INDIAN WOMAN -- NIMA GIACOMO eats with
gusto
GIACOMO
(as Nima pours the
wine)

Nimas a good cook

BARTOLOME
Shes more than that

Seeing GIACOMOS sudden blush and discomfort as NIMA
smiles at him the other BROTHERS laugh

To cover his embarrassment GIACOMO returns to the topic
of the food

GIACOMO
What is it

COLUMBUS
Eat Ill tell you later

As he sees BARTOLOME stifling a laugh GIACOMO pauses

GIACOMO
Id like to know what Im eating

COLUMBUS eats a mouthful glances at BARTOLOME

COLUMBUS

A look of horror crosses GIACOMOS face he wretches
slightly puts down his fork and gulps down some wine
The BROTHERS laugh again

Reluctantly thi

EXT BALCONY -

COLUMBUS
What wrong with it The Indians eat
it

GIACOMO
Im not an Indian

BARTOLOME
He wishes he were back in the
seminary Priests always eat well
(tasting his wine
grimacing)
And they have very good cellars

GIACOMO
Nothing grows here Everything rots
in the ground The wheat and vines
wither before we can harvest them

COLUMBUS
Weve got to learn to live like the
Indians
(pause)
Eat your Iguana

s time GIACOMO goes back to his dinner

GOVERNORS MANSION - NIGHT

They are drinking and smoking cigars

From the balcony

they can see the dark mass of the jungle stretching away
GIACOMO is already dozing in his chair BARTOLOME sees
it and elbows COLUMBUS They both smile at their younger

brothers exhaustion

Then COLUMBUS gets up and leans on

the balustrade looking down at the city the jungle

beyond

COLUMBUS

How much gold have we found

BARTOLOME

Not enough to justify a single
shipment

COLUMBUS

Perhaps it doesnt exist anywhere
but in my imagination

BARTOLOME

Then lets hope not

(pause)

What will happen if we cant find
enough gold
They begin to hear the sound of a flute -- a melancholy
sound COLUMBUS looks out over the jungle and kills a
mosquito by slapping his arm

COLUMBUS
(jokingly)
Then Im Governor of the Mosquitoes

CUT TO
INT INFIRMARY - CITY OF ISABEL - NIGHT
An INDIAN is playing the flute

In the gloomy interior of the long hut in the most
primitive conditions DOZENS OF SPANIARDS lie sick Ona
segregated part of the room are the INDIANS several
coughing

They are attended by a doctor DOCTOR CHANCA BROTHER
BUYL and other NOVICES

A NOVICE attends to an INDIAN gently lifting his head
helping him to drink -- there is so little they can do

BROTHER BUYL looks down at the body of a SPANIARD covered
in open sores The NOVICE joins him

BROTHER BUYL
What kind of disease is this

DOCTOR CHANCA
I dont know It seems almost as if
we have exchanged diseases with the
Indians They die of our most
common cold and we of their plague

God forgive us

away shocked

She is in a ward full of patients attended by a DOCTOR

The patients are emaciated their faces and bodies covered
with virulent sores NUNS move between the beds

DOCTOR
It seems to be caused by intimacy
with the native women Your Majesty
ISABEL
Will he survive

DOCTOR
No Your Majesty They go mad --

can do

ISABEL looks around at SANCHEZ appalled

SANCHEZ
Every ship returns with a cargo of

ISABEL
We werent expecting immediate

SANCHEZ bows in acknowledgement But ISABEL despite her
words looks distressed

EXT MINE - NEW WORLD - DAY
Excavations carved into a hillside

It is a blisteringly hot day At the foot of the hill
GIACOMO sits at a table beneath an awning with MOXICA and
several CLERKS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY INDIANS standing in
line at the table

In turn they hand over a small quantity of gold The
CLERK weighs it on a scale and notes down each
contribution

MOXICA impatiently gestures the INDIANS to move faster
with a thonged crop An INDIAN approaches the table He
is nervous He doesnt produce anything The INDIAN
shakes his head gesticulates starts to speak rapidly

TRANSLATOR
He says he has not found any

MOXICA
Hes lying

Again the INDIAN pleads and gesticulates MOXICA hits him

UTAPAN looks distraught -- this is the first time he is
being asked to do something against his own people He
looks up at COLUMBUS for help in confusion

COLUMBUS
You have to find them Utapan Look
what they did

UTAPAN

EXT RIVER BANK - JUNGLE - DAWN

COLUMBUS leads his party of SOLDIERS through the jungle
looking for the MUTINEERS

They reach the river -- scan the far bank Nothing
COLUMBUS nods His MEN start to enter the river led by a
HALBERDIER

Others follow wading across their weapons held above
their heads

A crossbow arrow pierces the HALBERDIER Without a cry he
falls forward into the water and is carried away by the
current

Two more MEN are hit One cries out thrashes around in
the water an arrow protruding from his side The river
stained with blood

Still no sign of the enemy COLUMBUS MEN nevertheless
start to return fire from the bank creating a shield
others continue to wade across the river A MUTINEER is
shot down from the branches of a tree

The first MEN come ashore Musket fire An exchange of
arrows COLUMBUS is now wading across The MAN next to
him is killed and carried away by the current

Now on the far shore the enemy have shown themselves
There is hand to hand fighting with swords and other
weapons MOXICA kills one of COLUMBUS men -- but his own
are outnumbered and outmatched Already some are
beginning to surrender
In the midst of the fighting COLUMBUS sword drawn pulls
himself out of the river A MUTINEER lunges at him
COLUMBUS kills him with a thrust of his sword -- and walks
forward into the jungle He spots MOXICA at the foot of a
cliff

EXT JUNGLE CLIMB TO CLIFF TOP - DAY

MOXICA starts scrambling up the rocks behind him with
COLUMBUS following The climb through the dense
undergrowth is so exhausting they are now almost climbing
in slow motion

EXT TOP OF CLIFF - DAY
MOXICA bursts out of the undergrowth He is at the edge
of emptiness swept by a violent offshore wind He turns

frantically to see COLUMBUS coming up behind him

Knowing he is lost MOXICA regains his natural arrogance
He steps backwards towards the edge

MOXICA
You know what they will say in Spain
about my death -- dont you

He takes another step backwards as COLUMBUS moves towards
him
MOXICA
You are nothing You bastards will
never inherit your titles We are

everything We are immortal

He smiles and steps back into space

A grimace suddenly transform THE YOUNG MANS face He is
being garroted -- his throat crushed with a rope The
YOUNG MANS feet dance frenziedly We hear the choking

The drums cease BROTHER BUYL crosses himself and murmurs
a prayer deeply distraught GIACOMO has covered his

I wish to go back with them Don
Colon I have no desire to remain
in this godless place

COLUMBUS
You may do as you please Brother
Buyl -- though your departure will

not help me to make it more Godly
BROTHER BUYL looks at him almost with astonishment

BROTHER BUYL
You treat Christians equally with
heathen savages You execute
members of the nobility And what
do you offer in return

(quietly)
A new world Brother Buyl

is still possible -- every
expectation every dream

towards him clearly moved by his white-hair and other
signs of physical deterioration

Her hand hovers over his head as if it means to console
him Her hand is dying to comfort But instead she
offers her hand for him to kiss

ISABEL
Rise Please

COLUMBUS gets slowly to his feet -- but his eyes as they
meet hers are as clear as before ISABEL smiles with
relief to see it He looks back at her

COLUMBUS
Now I do look older than you

She smiles -- then again tries to restrain it and keeps
her dignity

ISABEL
We have decided to allow you to
undertake another voyage to the new

COLUMBUS starts to interrupt she stops him with a
gesture

ISABEL
But without your brothers Nor are
you to return to Santo Domingo or

There is one thing Id like to
understand Why do you want to go

at the darkness Then looks at his SON again FERNANDO
wont give in to the sickness but COLUMBUS knows hed
feel better if he did

(in a strangled
voice)

(almost casually)
You know what I always used to do

The GOLDEN FIGURE turns and points into an unknown
distance

piece of charcoal from the fire and begins to draw on the
map Ignoring the Asian continent he sketches the
Panamanian coastline -- an isthmus MENDEZ and FERNANDO
gather round COLUMBUS watches the OLD INDIAN with
initial puzzlement then growing excitement

MENDEZ
Whats he doing

COLUMBUS
Hes drawing an isthmus Hes
saying were on an isthmus

sketch talking quietly all the time An INDIAN
TRANSLATOR listens

COLUMBUS
Tell me what hes saying

TRANSLATOR

He says -- water on the other side
COLUMBUS

Ask him if he means a lake A big

lake

The TRANSLATOR asks The OLD INDIAN shakes his head
laughs points to the west way beyond the other lakes
emphatically

Above and below much land

Here is Europe and over here the
continent of Asia But theres

The INDIAN crouches over the bed takes out a handful of

COLUMBUS to chew with the motions of his hands

COLUMBUS chews quickly falling asleep

A famished SOLDIER dips his hand in one of the bowls and
devours its contents some kind of stew Stepping back

behind him It rolls and crashes revealing the remains
of meat marinating in liquid There is something
disturbing about the appearance of the content

chewing He drops the half-empty bowl he was still
holding He runs at the back door rams his fingers deep
in the back of his throat and vomits

He stops and looks at his forearm -- soaked in blood
Shocked by his own fury he raises his hand and stares at

wings FERNANDO screaming at his FATHER drags him to

I I have to see Mendez
Then with sudden anger
COLUMBUS

Your brother was right I should
have never taken you with me Ill
never forgive myself Never

He walks a few steps lurches and has to lean against the
rail He raises his hand to his eyes grimacing in pain
as if they were burning FERNANDO scrambles to his feet
and rushes to him COLUMBUS eyes are already fixed
somewhere -- fever is eating him up

COLUMBUS
Will you ever forgive me

FERNANDO turns around for help

COLUMBUS
Captain Mendez

INT SHIPS CABIN - DAY

COLUMBUS is lying on his couch FERNANDO is bathing his
eyes sweeping off the pus that continuously forms in
them COLUMBUS is drenched in sweat

FERNANDO is writing under his FATHERS dictation

COLUMBUS
I came to Your Highness with honest
purpose and sincere zeal I did not
undertake these voyages for honor or
wealth -- that is certain After
years of service to the Crown I do
not have a roof to put over my
head Your Majesty allowed me to
explore the continent believed to
be Asia I now believe that it is
an new Land of unknown proportions
and wealth Life has more

INT ALCAZAR PALACE - GARDENS - DAY

The DUENA sitting beside ISABEL

read COLUMBUS

letter aloud

DUENA
I should be judged as a Seaman who
by Divine Will discovered a New
World and thereby placed it under
the sovereignty of Your Majesties
I humbly beseech Your Majesties that
if it pleases God to remove me
hence you will help the name of
Columbus to be remembered with
honor Weep for me whoever has
charity truth and justice

She stops reading ISABEL turns her face away

INT UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY

An ivory-sculptured hand -- the end of the back scratcher
belonging to AROJAZ -- indicates a line across a large

globe the route between Europe and America

We see a large amphitheater
a lecture of Nova Geographica -- the new geography

AROJAZ (0S)
The sunset route to the new
continent is now well-established

AROJAZ stands in front of the assembly Facing him

enthroned is KING FERDINAND

including SANCHEZ

We slowly move across the arena

AROJAZ
West by south west for 750
leagues to Santo Domingo From
there west north west leaving San
Juan to the north reaching the
island of Hispanola on the northern
cape of San Raphael Then onto the
mainland at the Cape called Gracias
a Dios

We continue to rise up the tiers of seats

quietly continues to

filled with PEOPLE attending

surrounded by COURTIERS

passing attentive faces

DISSOLVE
AROJAZ
Spain -- by Your Majestys grace --
has confirmed for all humanity the
existence of an unknown continent
Tierra Incognita

On a highest tier we stop on the face of CHRISTOPHER
COLUMBUS listening impassively

AROJAZ
This continent was first
discovered by a sailor commissioned
by your Majesty

CLOSE ON COLUMBUS eyes

AROJAZ
His name Amerigo Vespucci

On COLUMBUS

EXT UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY

Around the KING on horseback surrounded by the KNIGHTS
a CROWD is kept back by SOLDIERS AROJAZ is mounting his
horse SANCHEZ is waiting for him

COLUMBUS stands among the students at the back of the
CROWD

AROJAZ rides next to SANCHEZ AROJAZ suddenly spots
COLUMBUS in the crowd as they move off

AROJAZ
My God I thought he was dead

They pass close enough to touch COLUMBUS But he does not
see them

SANCHEZ
You can see for yourself

AROJAZ
What a tragedy what a waste of a
life

SANCHEZ

A waste Let me tell you
something Arojaz If your name or
mine is ever remembered -- it will
only be because of his

AROJAZ looks at SANCHEZ in surprise -- then cranes his
neck round and looks back at COLUMBUS -- now a FACE IN

THE CROWD

EXT LA RABIDA MONASTERY - KITCHEN GARDEN - DAY

ANTONIO DE MARCHENA a very old man now is taking a
siesta next to his grapes He is sitting in a simple
armchair a rosary wrapped around his fingers

The presence of someone wakes him After a moment he
recognizes COLUMBUS and smiles Both MEN are very moved

MARCHENA
I suppose were both old men now

COLUMBUS
Youll always be older than me
Father

They laugh COLUMBUS sits down Bees drone lazily in the
sunlight

COLUMBUS
Have you ever forgiven me

MARCHENA nods his head

MARCHENA
Yes I forgave you a long time ago
You see I was proud of you You
were like a willful child You
wouldnt accept what others told
you You had to find things out for
yourself hurting yourself -- and
others -- in the process

MARCHENA looks at his plants sighs contentedly

MARCHENA
Do you remember when you said that
people talk about the world but
never leave their gardens

COLUMBUS nods

MARCHENA
More than ever I wonder what it is
we do achieve by leaving our
gardens The world changes -- and
yet it seems the same We find new
worlds but fill them with the same
people

He pauses looks across at COLUMBUS smiles again gently
MARCHENA tiring leans back in his chair and looks up
towards the sun
COLUMBUS
I have to disagree

MARCHENA
I knew you would

COLUMBUS
New worlds create new people

MARCHENA
Oh So you are a new man

COLUMBUS
I dont know I have the
impression that I didnt change that
much I still cant accept the
world as it is

MARCHENA starts laughing

MARCHENA
God bless you and those like you

They both laugh

EXT BEATRIXS HOUSE BALCONY - EVENING

FERNANDO is sitting in front of his FATHER examining
documents and letters COLUMBUS has wrapped a shawl
around his legs He looks even older now with his mass
of pure white hair

BEATRIX comes out with a tray carrying grapes anda
decanter of water She places it on a small table near
COLUMBUS and touches his shoulder

As she is ready to return inside the house he holds her
back

COLUMBUS
Cant you stay with us a little

BEATRIX
I am busy inside

He smiles She looks at him smiling intrigued

BEATRIX
What is it now Tell me

COLUMBUS
I cant keep my eyes off you I
would like to catch up with all the
moments I didnt spend with you

FERNANDO looks up at them above his letters amused and
slightly embarrassed COLUMBUS looks at him with a fake
air of reproach

COLUMBUS
What are you listening to

FERNANDO
I am not listening Father But I
cant help hearing

FERNANDO opens a letter and reads it quickly

FERNANDO
Its Diego He is at the Court
with Santangel He says they hope

to get your privileges restored
And maybe the house

COLUMBUS smiles and nods -- all this seems to be of very
little importance to him now

COLUMBUS
But how is he And Dona Maria

FERNANDO continues to read
FERNANDO

Fine it seems Diego is thinking
of starting a pearl trade in Santo

Domingo He says he received many
letters for you Some of your men
mostly

He opens one of them glances at it

FERNANDO
This one is from Mendez

COLUMBUS eyes brighten with joy

COLUMBUS
What does he say

FERNANDO
He asks when he can come to visit
you He left his address

COLUMBUS
(smiling)
He never had one except aboard my
ships

FERNANDO laughs -- then suddenly serious
FERNANDO

I want you to tell me everything you
remember Father From the
BEGINS

beginning Everything

COLUMBUS
Really
(pause)
God I wouldnt know where to
start and yet
FERNANDO

Tell me the first thing that comes
to your mind

COLUMBUS sighs and leans back on his chair His eyes are
fixed somewhere searching Then almost in a murmur

COLUMBUS
I remember

We see the page FERNANDO writes I REMEMBER

A drop of ink falls from the quill onto the page and the
words

FERNANDO is waiting

COLUMBUS eyes

EXT BEACH AND JUNGLE - FIRST LANDING - DAY

A MOVING IMAGE as seen from the rolling deck of a ship
We see

A majestic forest resting on a slash of white sand and
deep blue sea

THE LONE SILHOUETTE of an INDIAN emerges from the dense
foliage He runs down the beach towards the surf He
stops and seems to be staring at us

These words appear on the screen
