OVER BLACK

The stir of children’s LAUGHTER echoes accompanied by the
rhythmic SQUEAKING of a swing set

As the playful laughter continues it’s quickly overshadowed
by an underlying eeriness A hollow pitch that prickles the
skin

FADE IN ON

A SERIES OF SHOTS FROM SECURITY CAMERAS

INT MEDIA ROOM - DAY

We look down on a techie’s wet dream filled with state of
the art equipment

A HOME VIDEO plays on the TV in the corner The sounds we
heard earlier match up with kids running across a playground

Then the video cuts out -- leaving a glowing blue screen
which silhouettes a DARKENED FIGURE Just standing there
Watching

Until the security footage flips to

INT HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY - DAY

LIBRARY STACKS Endless rows of paper knowledge collecting
dust on their shelves

On one wall we can see the entrance to the media room The
TV still glowing inside

LOCKERS

A fortress of battered lockers lines both sides of a dark
hallway

An open cutaway reveals several more rows of paint chipped
lockers

AUDITORIUM

A deserted stage stands before an army of padded chairs A
podium centers the emptiness

COURT YARD

An open concrete sea scattered with picnic tables
Darkness still looms giving way to daylight

INT ENTRANCE HALLWAY - DAY

WILSON 50s just this side of creepy sloshes water around
on the floor with a mop His beige janitor’s overalls are
grungy from years of wear

The lights kick on descending away from us Revealing the
extent of the long narrow corridor

Wilson looks up from his work He nods at someone then
shuffles off camera

END SECURITY CAMERA SHOTS

EXT SOUTH CARNEY HIGH - DAY

Early morning dew glistens underneath the west bound sun
Grounded deep in the soil is South Carney High Its Gothic
architectural style stands out amongst the modern buildings

that surround it

Fog settles over the sea of lined pavement Empty except for
ONE car

A light flickers OFF in the corner window of the second
story

INT WATKINS HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

Steam billows from a glass enclosed shower

The bathroom door is gently pushed open to reveal a mid 30s
clean cut white collar kind of guy NATHAN WATKINS

He tiptoes up to the glass door Slides it open Hops in the
shower

Giggles from inside A towel is draped over the side

GRACE (0S)
What are you doing

NATHAN (0S)
Save water shower with someone

GRACE (0OS)
Oh yeah Where’d you get that
NATHAN (0S)
Home Gardening channel I’m trying
to go green

GRACE (0S)
Mmm hmm I bet

The towel disappears

Out steps GRACE WATKINS in nothing but that towel and a
smile Holding on to the last traces of her youth she’s
thirty-six but would give anything to be twenty-one again
She grabs a plastic casing off the sink A pregnancy test
She quickly checks it

We don’t see the results

INT CONNER HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

Grace strides out of the bathroom in a GUNS N’ ROSES tour T-
shirt

She flips on the light in her closet Her clothes are a
refreshing sight compared to most mundane professional
attire She picks out a cute but decent blouse and pencil
skirt

The bathroom door swings open Nathan emerges from the steam
to see

Grace shimmying into the skirt

NATHAN
Whatd it say

GRACE
What

Nathan nods toward the bathroom
A beat

GRACE
Negative

Nathan and Grace each dress at their respective closets

NATHAN
I’m getting rusty Better cut back
on all the mountain dew and
steroids
He chuckles

GRACE
The one I got is all I can handle

NATHAN
Your logic is a bit flawed

Grace glances up at him

GRACE
That’s right I have to put up with
you too

Nathan heads over to the dresser mirror where he works the
knot on his tie He watches Grace’s reflection as she slips
into her blouse

NATHAN
You tutoring today

GRACE
Heck no

NATHAN
Good

Grace rolls her eyes

GRACE
Good because

Nathan fiddles nervously with his tie

NATHAN
I don’t know Don’t those dumb
young jocks get enough of you in

GRACE
Nathan--

NATHAN
I mean you know those meatheads--

GRACE
With their sculpted bodies

NATHAN
And their dirty minds

Grace sashays over to him Wraps her arms around his waist
as he stares at himself in the mirror
GRACE
It’s a school requirement babe

NATHAN
Yeah yeah Which reminds me
I’m having lunch with a hot twenty-

one year old client -- ass like you

Grace playfully swats Nathan on the back of the head and
moves away

CARSON (0S)
G’morning

They turn to see CARSON WATKINS a towheaded seven year old
with a huge grin

GRACE NATHAN
Morning sweetie Morning bub

CARSON

Today in Mrs Kelsey’s class were
getting to play with frogs I mean

getting a new hamster because I
squeezed the other one too tight

---Oh I have a ball game tonight

Nathan and Grace glance at each other overwhelmed
GRACE
Take him to the game I’11 meet you

there when I’m done

NATHAN
I need to work late

GRACE
I’ve got to finish up grading
papers today

NATHAN
Fine

Nathan fumbles to loop his tie in a perfect knot
NATHAN
I know you were joking but I’m
serious Grace After last semester
I worry

Loaded beat

They both turn to Carson forgetting he was there He’s still
grinning from ear to ear

GRACE
Sweetie go switch your shoes onto
the other foot And turn your shirt
around

Carson looks down Sure enough Carson’s shirt is backwards
and his shoes pointed outwards He darts off

Grace turns back to Nathan

GRACE
Youre overreacting

Nathan yanks his tie off and starts all over
NATHAN
I held my tongue because they
expelled him

Nathan stares at himself in the mirror as he adjusts the tie
The bottom is longer than the top He jerks it off again

Grace slides it out of his hand Silence as she ties it
perfectly

GRACE
I‘1l stop tutoring if you stop
working late

A searing look before Grace disappears Leaving Nathan alone
with his reflection

INT WATKINS HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Grace rifles through kitchen cabinets throwing stuff into a
green lunch box

CARSON
Fruit roll up

GRACE
Uh uh No more sugar for you kid
Nathan sets down his briefcase

Grace hands Carson his lunch box and ushers him around the
counter

GRACE
We’re gonna be late

Nathan stops her for a kiss She pecks him on the lips but
keeps moving Carson towards the front door Nathan rubs his
lips His fingertips colored

NATHAN

Are you wearing lipstick
GRACE

A little
NATHAN

Since when

He grabs his briefcase and heads towards the door Grace
slips the backpack onto Carson’s back

GRACE

She opens the door Carson sprints out Grace follows

Nathan rubs his fingers together The lipstick is gone

high-spirited energy to their banter
INT GRACE’S CAR - DAY

Grace stares at the glow of an SUV taillight Her mind
elsewhere until

-her eyes flit upwards

Crossing a few cars ahead is CHRIS MCKINLEY a good-looking
enigmatic senior in dirty jeans and a worn hoodie -- a loner
who could get in with any clique if he wanted

Grace tracks him as he walks by a group SENIOR GUYS keeping
his distance from them They smirk and nod at him but he
avoids eye contact

HONK

INT ENTRANCE HALLWAY - DAY

Wilson stuffs tools into his tool belt He pulls on the
handle

CLANK

He sighs Grabs his keys and UNLOCKS the door Grace shuffles
in as Wilson stares her down

GRACE
Sorry about that

Wilson turns his attention back to the front door He twists
the key back and forth The DEAD BOLT protrudes then
retracts

WILSON
(mumbles )
You didn’t break the key off in the
door Damn brittle keys

He clicks it back one last time to unlock it then walks
away
INT HALLWAY - LOCKERS - DAY

That manic energy we saw outside is even more apparent here --
the voices of students oddly upbeat for a school morning
Grace fumbles her keys as she walks down the hall

Testosterone-filled heads turn She keeps her head down but
she knows -- she’s the ‘hot teacher’

She glances up only once when she passes by Chris He
smiles PRINCIPAL SAMONEK 50s walks by Grace suppresses
her own smile

The bell rings

Chris follows her

CHRIS
Good morning Mrs Watkins

His voice is deep Charming That smile never wavering
Grace doesn’t look back

Auditorium in five Chris
INT AUDITORIUM - DAY

The seats are packed with restless seniors the din of a
hundred voices filling this enormous room

Chris lounges in his chair eavesdropping on a couple of
SENIOR GUYS

SENIOR GUY
Oh Grace Watkins Soooo hot want
to touch the hiney awoooocooo

The guys bust out in laughter at the familiar Billy Madison
phrase

Chris’s face goes rigid
GRACE (0S)
(over microphone)

Testing Testing

Chris turns his attentive eyes to

THE STAGE
Where Grace stands confidently at the podium
GRACE
Okay folks I’11 try not to bore
you too much
The class quiets down somewhat
GRACE
As you’re all well aware were
closing in on the home stretch
here Some of you will be moving
on to higher education some of you
will be getting hired and some of
you will well be getting
higher
Laughter from the class

Principal Samonek frowns at Grace She ignores it -- not
much for uptight decorum

GRACE
I see a lot of you most days

Her VOICE FADES OUT so that her lips are moving but we can’t
hear Her gaze wanders over to

Chris who reclines with his hands clasped behind his head
eyes never shifting from her

She lingers on him for a second then glances elsewhere
still speaking -- but we still can’t hear

All we hear is RUSTLING and SHIFTING the occasional SQUEAK
of a chair Then

Some of the faces in the crowd betray confusion There’s a
snicker here and there Whispers tickle the air

Principal Walker’s eyes bug out
A hand goes up LINDSEY probably on the cheer team waits
Grace spots it Her voice returns

GRACE
Lindsey

All eyes are on Lindsey as she sheepishly lowers her hand

LINDSEY
What did you mean by we’1l all find
our sexiness

More snickers Grace’s face flushes

GRACE
Success Lindsey You’1ll all find
your own success

Grace chuckles

GRACE
Must be the mic

Her gaze goes back to Chris -- who in this room of restless
seventeen and eighteen year-olds has not shifted position one
inch His eyes are still locked on Grace

She composes herself Her tone shifts

GRACE
As the head senior sponsor I just
want to remind you that this is
your last quarter so make those
extra memories Skip the extra
studying time for that girl’s night
out Laugh until you can’t breathe
anymore because the memories you
make right now have to last you
for the rest of your life

We get the feeling Grace knows this all too well

INT GRACE’S CLASSROOM - DAY

Students pair up at lab tables They slip on the aprons and
gloves waiting for them at each station

On each table are several pebble sized rocks Next to them
sits a shallow dish of water

Grace finishes handing out the last few graded EXAMS
She passes by Chris who is indulged in a CLASSIC NOVEL
GRACE
Book away Mr McKinley You’re on
my time

Chris complies Grace hands out the last test

GRACE
(casually)
I want to make something clear I
refuse to be the village idiot and
let my senior chemistry class mix
chemicals that will kill us all

She smiles The class chuckles

GRACE
Alkali metals are highly reactive
with water Lithium

She picks up a small pebble Tosses it into a dish of water
It fizzes and crackles

GRACE
-Sodium

She tosses in a another pebble This one IGNITES into a small
flame then sizzles out

GRACE

--is all that I trust you with in
this small room Let me move a few
doors down and you can throw in
potassium rubidium and cesium at
the same time if you want But
don’t expect to live to tell about
it

She smiles Chris smirks at her

She jots down several letters on the board Li Na K Rb
Cs

GRACE
Least reactive to most reactive

The class groans She stops writing

GRACE

Fine we’ll see who remembers this
when we come back from spring
break Go crazy I don’t care But
whatever mess you make clean it
up I’m not your mom Thank god

Chris furrows his eye brow He quickly turns his attention to
Lindsey

Grace sits at her desk She observes the students as their
concoctions fizzle and crackle -- some of the pebbles
dropping to the floor despite her wishes

LATER

Students clean up their messes

Lindsey cleans up her area Chris stares at her backside as
she bends over -- his ogling obvious Grace notices

The BELL rings

GRACE

Grace opens the door for the class They filter out
She stands in the hallway Monitoring

Chris standing behind her desk He holds a picture of
Grace Carson and Nathan They look happy

CHRIS
He’s cute

Grace pries the picture away

GRACE
He’s seven

CHRIS

CHATTER buzzes loudly in the hallway

Grace shoos Chris out from behind her desk before students
enter

CHRIS
I almost made a “B” this time

GRACE

CHRIS
I was thinking UC

GRACE
Then I guess I need to be a
chemistry Nazi during your next
tutor session

CHRIS

GRACE
The last day before vacation I
don’t think so buster
A strange look from Chris “oh”
GRACE
Forget about chemistry for a week

Grace turns away Chris walks for the door He turns back
around

CHRIS
Do you know what else today is

GRACE

leaving her with a brief heartbreaking smile

Grace slides the picture of her family behind her keyboard

calls for help

GRACE
Garrett Wes

Husky Teen is now pounding away on Basketball Senior Blood
smeared on their fists and faces

Grace watches as Basketball Senior eyes flit backwards He
grows increasingly less and less conscious of the fact that
he’s getting the shit beat out of him

GRACE
Stop

Her plea dismissed

She grits her teeth and JUMPS in front of Husky Teen Luckily
his next punch whizzes by her ear She SHOVES him away
putting space between the two

But Husky Teen doesn’t let up He tries to push past Grace
She can’t hold him off

Suddenly the back of his collar is ripped backwards

HOWIE WESTON mid 20s awkward but cute in his SECURITY GUARD
UNIFORM grips onto the back of Husky Teen’s shirt

Principal Samonek stomps up from behind

PRINCIPAL SAMONEK

Husky Teen heads towards the office Principal Samonek and
Howie carry Basketball Senior away

Students disperse from the thirty most exciting seconds of
their day

Chris emerges from the crowd

CHRIS
You okay

fights

Grace babies her middle finger Chris sees her wince when she
tries to move it

GRACE
Yeah well I haven’t always been

A half smirk from Chris

CHRIS

them head high as he rolls out the mop and bucket

box

CHRIS

smile twisting his lips

Alone Just wanting to go home

She’s oblivious to the faint sound of HAMMERING from
somewhere in the building

A glance at her watch reveals that it’s now 554

INT AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
The main door swings open
And Grace steps into the DARK cavernous space

A trace of sunlight seeps in from windows high above Just
enough for her to see

She scopes out the room Empty Checks her watch

GRACE
You’re kidding me

She’s about to head back out the door when she spots --
A SILHOUETTE on the stage Just standing there

GRACE
Hello

No answer

GRACE
Is the meeting still on

The silhouette checks its own watch -- then turns and heads
off stage its shoes CLACKING loudly with every step

GRACE
Hey Who’s there

MALE VOICE
Grace

GRACE
Yeah Who is it

MALE VOICE
It’s on

GRACE

The meeting
More silence

After a moment Grace makes her way down the aisle her
footsteps pinched with hesitation

When she hits a pocket of inky blackness she hurries her
pace -- every step taking her closer to the stage

GRACE
Hello

Despite the ominous silence curiosity propels her up the
stairs

And onto the stage Her eyes struggle to adjust to the dark
as she nears an odd LUMP in the center of the floor

A STAGE LIGHT bursts to life stopping her cold She squints
her eyes against the glare

On the stage sits a picnic basket

CHRIS (0OS)
I hope you’re not mad

Grace whips around to see CHRIS step out wearing a pristine
TUXEDO He holds up the teacher memo
