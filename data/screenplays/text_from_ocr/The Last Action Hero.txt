FADE IN

A SEA OF LIGHTS

Flashing blue Flashing red

The BUBBLE LIGHTS of FIFTY LAPD patrol cars
BUMPER TO BUMPER Filling the street

COPS run every which way Padded vests Kevlar body armor
SWAT TEAMS in military fatigues From the expression on faces
we get the idea there’s some SERIOUS SHIT HERE —
centered on the roof of an ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

A POLICE LIEUTENANT shivers in his trench coat this is DEKKER
BlackTough Not only eats nails for breakfast but likes them

POLICE LIEUTENANT DEKKER
Helluva way to spend Christmas

Turns to a nearby ROOKIE
DEKKER
Secure the sidewalks No one in or out

Hes cut off as a BURST OF GUNFIRE STRAFES the cars

Glass shatters Cops dive for cover FE

The gunfire abruptly CEASES -- bits of shrapnel PINGING fo the ground —
and a VOICE issues from the roof

VOICE
HO HO HO GOT A PRESENT FOR You PIGS

A semi-automatic rifle sails over the edge of the roof

Clatters to the ground It’s followed by the corpse of a SWAT SNIPER
it lands on the roof of a police car The windows blow out

Flying glass cuts faces of policemen around the car

VOICE
WARNED YOU NO CUTE STUFF
(beat)
NOW BRING ME MY HELICOPTER-OR K START
THROWING KIDS NEXT
DEKKER staring up at the roof Face coniorted in rage f

DEKKER
Let the children go Goddamn you Ripper

Silence meets his request A ROOKIE COP steps up to him
ROOKIE
Perimeter’s secure sir An armored division
couldn’‘t get thru it

CUT TO BOOTED FEET
‘eo

Trudging forward relentless powerful They arent walking on pavement
There’s no sidewalk beneath the boots Theyre walking on police cars

A lone figure strides ACROSS ROOFS

wading thru a SEA OF FLASHING LIGHT like a juggernaut

Dressed casually in a bomber jacket and jeans

T-shirt with a slight tear near the shoulder Cigar Three-day stubble

AAA Ruger Blackhawk the BIGGEST GUN EVER MADE

perches in his hand like an old friend
SERGEANT JACK SLATER is in a bad mood tonight
EXT POLICE BARRICADES - SAME

SLATER steps from the hood of a patrol car Heads for the barricades
never breaking stride DEKKER glares at SLATER moves alongside

DEKKER
Dont even think it Slater You hear me Youre
gonna sit and wait for the real hostage
negotiator

SLATER keeps walking eyes front

DEKKER
Goddammit Jack am TALKING to you Last
time you pulled this shit people lost body
parts

SLATER walks

DEKKER
If you go in there is your BADGE

SLATER takes out his badge throws it at DEKKER keeps on walking
DEKKER stops watches as

TWO EXTREMELY WELL-DRESSED MEN- move into SLATER’s path

SLATER
(not stopping)
tt would be best for everybody if you got out
of my way --

THE MAYOR
(moving backwards as he
talks)

Jack — 1 know asMayor of this great
metropolis you and have had the
occasional little tiff —

SLATER SOCKS HIM The guy goes over backwards

SLATER
When the Governor gets here call me

INT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - FIRST FLOOR - SAME
A SWAT COP stands at the base of the stairs Listens to his walkie-talkie
VOICE ON WALKIE-TALKIE
(Dekkers)
Slater is attempting to enter pe not let him in
Repeat DO NOT FT HIM IN

SWAT COP
Piece of cake

A FINGER taps the SWAT cop on the shoulder

SLATER
Hey You wanna be a fore

The guy spins alarmed —
SLATER
Heres two achers

SLATER kicks him in the crotch

From behind we see the guy pop THREE FEET iN THE AiR
He comes down bam -- Wonders what those things in his mouth are
SLATER CATCHES the walkie-talkie Speaks into it—

SLATER
Dekker -- The next one ll hurt

He crushes the instrument in-his-fist Drops it Walks

Up the stairs Past BODIES Teachers Janitors Flung like rag dolls
SLATER seems not to notice Loads his gun Chambers a slug KA CHUCK

EXT ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING CITY - NIGHT
The door FLIES FROM ITS HINGES -- SLATER stands like a judgment from God

We cant see the villain he’ 5 facing but we do see a FIRE AXE clutched in
the guy’s hand It enters frame in the foreground Suddenly Shockingly

POV SLATER Huddled in a corner a dozen frightened Sth graders

He presses the axe to the kids throat A pause -- SLATER drops the gun

The killer locks eyes with SLATER Says

‘

SLATER
All right m unarmed Now let the boy go

RIPPER an
One weapon Jack Who you kidding

SLATER shrugs Lifts his shirt Three more guns fucked in his waistband
He loses them A DAGGER taped to his calf joins the guns

RIPPER
is that all sport
SLATER

Yup That about does it except for well
(beat) ©
Unless you call this a weapon

With that he fishes out a GRENADE

Pulls the pin and casually tosses it to the madmans feet

Sits there as time standis still The killer eyes SLATER speculatively --
and applauds

RIPPER
Brilliant surrender

SLATER shrugs Says calmly

SLATER
Thats a live grenade

RIPPER
(shakes his head)
You wouldnt kill your ownsonBut lets find out

RIPPER
Andypick up the grenade Have a close
look why dont you

Scared Andrew does Holds if up so the killer can see

Fairly convincing - but a dummy nonetheless

RIPPER
Your toy cant hurt the kid
(beat -- raising his axe)
But mine can --

At which point Andrew touches a STUD on the bogus grenade --
A three-inch BLADE shoots out with a sharp SHHICK

The kid PLANTS IT IN THE RIPPERS LEG

Composite Draft
101092
The killer HOWLS in pain

SLATER sees his chance -- dives for the big 44
THE RIPPER THROWS his axe --

it whoogashes not two inches over SLATER

Andrew makes a break for it but THE RIPPER GRABS him by the arm
Yanks the grenade KNIFE from his own leg --

SLATER raises the gun —

THE RIPPER brings the knife down toward the kid s heart —

SLATER TAKES HIS SHOT BLAM --

At which point friends and neighbors
the filrn forno reason whatsoever goes completely OUT OF FOCUS
This doesnt stop the ACTION you understand Because even though
we CANT SEE whats happening we can HEAR it

Shots Screams Pounding music Surely the best
action sequence weve never seen

Suddenly a VOICE shouts Focus

And lo and behold we slowly PULL BACK
to realize that weve been watching a MOVIE WITHIN A MOVIE

that in not foo many years hes going to be a terrific young man
With friends and admirers and schools chasing after him girls too
Heres what he knows now that weird things are going on with his body
that hes scared all the time that hes friendless and thin and poor

Heres what he fears most that nothing is ever going to change

The ticket-taking popcorn seller is half asleep Opens his eyes briefly

INT PS 75 - HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

Class is well underway Without DANNY A young bearded energetic
TEACHER lectures on Hamiet

TEACHER
Ghosts Sword fights Sex And everybody dies
Shakespeares Hamlet couldnt be more
exciting

The kids in this class remain unconvinced

DANNY slips into the room Sits alone in the rear Quickly opens his notebook
No one pays any attention He might as well not be there

TEACHER
Despite his inability to act Hamlet is still an
inspiration You might call hirn one of the first
action heroes
(the students yawn)
But think youll see all this in ihe clip so why
dont we just roll it

DANNY perks up The lights go down

TEACHER
This is the Laurence Olivier version Some of
you might remember him as Zeus in Clash of
the Titans

The clip from Hamlet begins rolling On the classroom screen CLAUDIUS
kneels before the altar

CLAUDIUS
What if this cursed hand were thicker than
itself with brothers’ blood Is there not rain
enough in the sweet heavens to wash it white

MONTAGE- °° a

JACK SLATERs theme BLASTS as we see shots of SLATER still with the turtleneck
and medallion

Running through the brooding moody castle of Elsinore UZIS spitting in both
hands as GUARDS fall right and left

Brooding in the graveyard with Yoricks SKULL then spinning around —
throwing it with deadly accuracy THUNK The skull’s teeth IMBED in the
guaras head Taking him out

SLATER
Heads up

Rising in slow-mo from the MOA7 Rambo-style shooting up THROUGH the
drawbridge faking out more guards

Yanking back a curtain to reveal POLONIUS

POLONIUS
Stay thy hand fair Prince The lovely Ophelia is
even now our captive Should you exact thy
vengeance the maiden shail unto you be
delivered portion by bloody portion

SLATER thinks it over

SLATER
Who said m fair

He BLOWS Polonius away

DEEP BASS ANNOUNCER
NO ONES GONNA TELL THIS SWEET
PRINCEGOODNIGHT

SLATER stands ouiside the castle Elsinore behind him

SLATER
To be or not to be

He takes out a cigar Puts it between his lips Flips open his Zippo

SLATER
Not to be

And as he flicks his lighter the castie explodes into a cloud of fire Splinters
Pieces fly —

whirr of the projector mixes with the glorious sound of OLIVIER

DANNY sighs

A ticket Danny youve got to have a ticket to

With grand magicians Hourish - and some clumsy sleight-of-hand --
he produces

AN ORNATE GOLDEN TICKET Outsized and odd

DANNY stares — its like nothing else

NICK
(awe in his tone)
Harry Houdini himself gave me that Danny
was your age and my pop he took me
backstage after a show
(beat)
And he made a gesture Mr Houdini did --
and this wasin-his hand And he whispered to
me --
(whispering now)
-- This is a magic ticket he said The greatest
magician in India gave ittome andthe
greatest magician in Tibet gave it to him Its a
passport to another world If was mine and
now its yours”

was like a God to me -- what if he was
faking

As Nick moves to shut the door —

NICK
He said one other thing This ticket has a
mind of its own young man It does what it
wants to do
(Closing the door)
That always made me a just litle edgy

DANNY
Well theres only one way to find out right

Nick nods a sudden gleam in his aging eyes

He holds out the ticket Holds his-breath and --

Rips it --

And fora moment just a moment mind you we think we perceive
what A SPARK A flash A trick of light gone as quick as it came—
But we had the impression the ticket had been well activated

And on that trunk is a smail round target

He leans i into the bound man

What if your mother suddenly grew three heads and they all started fighting
over bridge scores You get the idea

DANNY -
“Um Nick Hello

The dynamite begins to roll down the aisle

IN THE PROJECTION BOOTH

Nick cant hear over the noise of the car chase and gunfire

THE DYNAMITE

Now we see what happened when the film went OUT OF FOCUS

SLATERs shot takes THE RIPPER in the shoulder
SPINS him to the roof edge Teetering

He goes over

But in that moment he manages fo latch anand on Andrews collar —
SLATER watches thunderstruck — as beth go over

THE RIPPER plummets With SLATERs son Into a SEA of police light
Flashing dlue Flashing red

squeezes inru the crowd

Up ahead he spots a man in an elegant tan overcoat

With a large cut in the back end what appear to be blood stains

He pushes anging to see ihe face it’s omiged -- ITS THE RIPPER
And the giant senses him staring AND LOOKS DOWN AT HIM
DANNY snaps his face away but he cant do anything

Hes four feet tall squeezed in a crowd next to a child-murderer with an axe
under his coat

THE RIPPER eyes the boy carefullythen looks away

They move like cattle penned ina chute -
if he can just to the aisle if he can break out if somehow he can get to Jack

ON THE LOWER BALCONY SLATER
scanning the crowd suddenly hears DANNYs voice ting out out in the
theatre-

DANNY
JACK ITS THE RIPPER
HES BROUGHT BACX THE RIPPER -

SLATER careens to the front of the baicony looks up and —
There above him is a reincarnated nightmare from his past

THE RIPPER axe high ready to throw —
For an instant they lock eyes lost together in time and space—

Then all hell breaks loose —

THE RIPPER dives from sight

SLATER draws his gun Leaps up one foot on the balcony rail one on a seat
assumes a firing stance and yells

i SLATER
EVERYBODY DOWN NOW

THE RIPPER flees across the front row of the upper balcony

Screams and panic spread SLATER shuts it out Targets the coat A nice big
bulls eye -- H

And thats when ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER rocket SLATER to the ground

At the second ficor landing DANNY
