MELVIN AND HOWARD

FADE IN

WATERIHOLE - STONEWALL PASS NEVADA 1

The desert between Las Vegas and Tonopah nothing but sage
and greasewood Sound -- in the distance a motor It comes
closer then fades comes closer fades

Pan off the waterhole in the direction of the sound It
approaches again a figure appears in the distance

ON THE MOTORCYCLE 2

Only the riders back silver-streaked hair This gaunt ficure
circles lazily in the moonlicht motorcycle tires rumbling over
the alkali The circles get bigger and now biccer and as he
comes around this time the moonlight catches his face aristo-
cratic cheekbones a stringy beard a pilots light windbreaker
This is Howard age 62 looks over 70

ANOTHER ANGLE - HOWARD 3
sweeping under the moon wider and wider and now he speeds

towards the waterhole giving the Harley full throttle

ON THE WATERHOLE

A knoll running up to the edge of it

ON HOWARD 5

heading straight for the knoll the chopper kicking up sage
and greasewood and alkali behind it Tremendous speed -- it
hits the knoll

ON THE MOTORCYCLE 6

Howard flying through the air his knees clutched around the
machine his eyes wide with joy laughter rincinc throuch the
desert

The motorcycle clears the waterhole on the leap Howard snug
in the saddle lands in the mud on the other side skids
churns the tires spitting mud now he rolls out on the
desert again

ANOTHER ANGLE « HOWARD

sweeping into a figure eight testing his motor now picking
up speed once more heading straight for the knoll

ON THE KNOLL

The motorcycle invisible only the sound blasting through the
night louder louder and now the motorcycle hits the top of
the knoll A rock a stone something it kicks it stutters
it flies short

ON HOWARD

His face exactly the same as before exultation at the leap
but there is no motorcycle under him now only air

ANOTHER ANGLE - HOWARD

His momentum carrying him over the water and he lands with a
crunch on the other side his head hits the mud a flare of
blood spurts from his ear

HOWARDS POINT OF VIEW

His eye catching sight of his motorcycle fluttering down
landing with a splash bubbling as it disappears into the

waterhole

TITLES OUT

ON HOWARD
picking himself up stumbling across the desert nothing but

silence around him his feet kicking over the alkali He
trips a bobcat swings past looks moves on

ANOTHER ANGLE - HOWARD

faltering falling

Ne picks himself up his face scratched his lips crusted
with saliva blood caked around his ear

HOWARDS POINT OF VIEW 14

Way in the distance the headlights of a car

ON HOWARD 15

He starts to raise his hand almost furtively but then he
draws it back He does not want to wave

He looks towards the moon spins once like a shot-putter
Now he falls

The headlights pass on down the Interstate Darkness

LONG SHOT - A SINGLE HEADLIGUT 16

coning down the Interstate now Sound - a man singing The
song is horrible the voice joyous

MELVIN (vo0)
(singing)
Well he called his elves together
To soup up his 01d sleigh
So Rudolph and the other reindeer
Could rest on Christmas Day

INT CAR - ON MELVIN DUMMAR 17

a face with no secrets a cowlick and sideburns looking
younger than his thirties Montgomery’ Ward pants and a
shirt with cowboy roses’
MELVIN
(singing)

‘Hes got a million miles to travel

And hell do it in one day

Oh thats because old Santa Claus

Got a souned-up Santa sleich

The song trails off into a hum as Melvin pulls off onto the
side of the road

ON MELVIN 18

undoing his fly As he reaches into his pants the sound of
a car in the distance he quickly turns to hide himself the
car passes

Now he reaches in again but another car catches him in its
lights

MELVIN
Jeesuz

He climbs back into his car stomps on the gas and he zooms

off the highway and on to the alkali up an old cattle road

Now he scuds to a stop steps out onto the emptiness of the
desert

ANOTHER ANGLE MELVIN 19
pissing sighing with relief his sich mingling with the
crackling of his urine as it hits the desert crust

ON MELVINS FACE 20

Pleasure The same pleasure he feels at eating sleeping
defecating copulating

Climbs back into his car Starts up the motor backs around
and the headlight catches a body lying in the deserted cattle
road

ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN 21
blinks Squints now he throws the car into low gear rolls
slowly towards the body stops a few feet away

ON MELVINS POINT OF VIEW 22

The body doesnt move Limp dead

ON MELVIN 23

following the shaft of the headlight moving towards the body
Poised a step away

Now he crouches over it A grunt Melvin rolls it over A
beard Howards long hair He lifts him the headlight shines

full into Howards eyes they open flicker Howard grunts
again

head and the ear comes into view fresh blood trickling over
the clotting Melvin heaves Howard up half-stumbling half-
carrying him towards the car opens the passenger side and
shovels him in

ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN

desert

MELVINS POINT OF VIEW

Only blackness and silence

ANOTHER ANGLE - MELVIN

passenger Howard has scrunched himself into a corner his
eyes are wide open now and wild with terror Melvin catches
it

Melvin smiles nothing from Howard Melvin smiles again

MELVIN

Howard doesnt answer He turns his head a little but as he
turns blood oozes

MELVIN

door

MELVIN
Well go to Beatty Okay

He throws the car into gear spins around and heads off to-
wards the interstate

INT CAR

Melvin at the wheel Howard hiding in the corner of the seat
offering Melvin as narrow a view of his face as possible
Suddenly a clatter Melvins head whips around Howard has
been taken with the shakes terrible heaves his teeth chat-
tering

Howard doubles over trying to warm himself clutching both
shoulders cross-handed Melvin reaches for the heater
clicks it on nothing happens

MELVIN
This aint but a 66 - damn heater
never did work

Howard shudders again a terrible whistling through his teeth

Melvin bangs the heater with his fist

HOWARD
It’s okay

MELVIN

Melvin pulls over to the side of the road

ON MELVIN

giant plastic bags full of white powder some horse harness

TWO-SHOT - HOWARD AND MELVIN 29

Melvin leans towards Howard drapes the blanket over him but
does not drape It is about the size of a shirt and the pil-
low he places under his head would fit a doll

Howard regards them

MELVIN
They belong to my little girl Cant
go to sleep without’ her bumby

Melvin laughs

MELVIN
Shit

Howard shivers the tiny blanket falls off him He doesnt
have the strength to pick it up Melvin bends over to re-
trieve it as he does his head hits the dashboard and the
heater whirrs on

MELVIN
Well damn Damn

He laughs again Nothing fron Howard still underneath the
baby blanket but now allowing his head to ease back ever so
slightly into the pillow

Melvin reaches his hand under the heater

MELVIN
Warm as toast You brought me luck

undressed her in the car

Howard stirs slightly Melvin squints over at him Melvin
reaches across Howard flips open the glove compartment --

are lying before this Court I will

that the district attorney bring a
criminal prosecution against you and
I will make it my special project

reconmend that you do prison tine

MELVINS POINT OF VIEW

Howard looking carefully at the dashboard Very slowly
he puts the car into gear very slowly he releases the
brake and very slowly he rolls it out onto the road

ON MELVIN AND HOWARD

Melvin watching as Howard drives Howard watching
Melvin watching him Now Melvins head begins to nod
His eyes close

ON HOWARD

Driving now he turns sneaks a look at Melvin who is
sound asleep beside him Gives the car a little cas
and becins to sina

HOMAPD
(singing quietly)
Make my bed
And light the light
Ill arrive
Late tonight
Blackbird
Blackbird
Bye Bye

Howard props his arm out the window adjusts the mirror
now he gives the car more gas

He is very happy

MELVINS CAR
rolling down the highway to Las Vegas From it --

ROWARD (vo0)
(singing)
‘Pack up all my cares and woes
Singin low
Here I go
Bye bye blackbird

The car becomes a dot It never disappears nor does
the music end

FADE OUT

THE END
