Their sudden ATTENTION is to a knock on the door The BOY runs through the
short hallway at the front door and opens it

ALL FROM THE BOY’S POV

A MANS hand raised in front of his face to a wool skullcap The hand pulls
down on the “cap” It’s a ski mask that covers the man’s face

RADIO (CONT)
There was almost a serious mistake in the Falls Road
area when an army patrol was ambushed by children
who had been given realistic looking toy guns and
uniforms for Christmas

He pushes past the boy and STRIDES FAST to the dining room doorway The
boy hurries after and reaches the striding man’s side Looks into the room
along the man’s arm which is now holding a MACHINE PISTOL

The father’s eyes go wide with surprise rather than terror

The gun directly in front of the boy suddenly opens fire

BLASTING THE FATHER backward off his chair

ANGLE ON THE BOY

He rushes over to his little sister and tries to stand protectively between her and
the horror

OMeara stops turns his head slowly around instinctively conscious of
RORY POINTING HIS GUN STRAIGHT AT HIM
He stares fearless and vulnerable Straight into Rorys eyes

Rory blinks Looks at his gun hand as if it belonged totally to someone else
Wonders why the finger doesnt pull the trigger

Suddenly there is a loud SNAP as the frayed winch rope gives way
Simultaneously

THE BOAT LURCHES FORWARD AT A SHARP ANGLE

RORY AND OMEARA HURTLE TOWARDS THE BOW

tripping and sliding until —

THEY CRASH INTO A FORE WALL guns Skitfering

Now the deck-HEAVES UP in the other direction as the boat
RIGHTS ITSELF SPLASHING INTO THE WATER

When the rocking subsides we see

O’MEARA ON ALL FOURS

facing off fifteen feet from

RORY ON ALL FOURS

The guns lay between them OMearas pistol four feet in front and Pointing
the wrong way Rorys a similar distance in front of himbut Pointing at
OMeara

They glance at each other Down at the guns Then back eye to eye

RORY

OMEARA
Theres another way
a RORY
Its not an American story Remember
O’MEARA

We can change it
Rory shakes his head no

- RORY
Its an Irish story

O’MEARA
We can change it

The boat is DRIFTING NOW out into the harbor As it sways in the water on

deck
THE GUNS INCH BACK AND FORTH
RORY
How
OMeara has no answer
RORY (CONT)
Ge home Go home to your island fll go
home to mine
OMEARA

Like two cats they face off backs Stiffening ready to pounce

RORY
Neither can

Their eyes meet Rory smiles

RORY

Its like a signal
O’MEARA
Yes see

INSTANTLY THE TWO MEN DIVE FOR THEIR WEAPONS
OMEARA GRABS THE GUN ROLLS

RORY GRABS HIS GUN BUT DOESNT ROLL

HE FIRES OFF THE MARK AS OMEARA FIRES

BOOM BOOM BOOM THREE BULLETS RIP INTO RORYS TORSO
He staggers back Drops his gun

OMeara runs over Props Rory up by his shoulders

O’MEARA
God damn you Damn you

Rory is bleeding everywhere Quiet voiced

RORY
Well then

OMEARA
Jesus Jesus

Rory coughs Hes going He is barely abie to whisper O’ ‘Meara bends down to
try to understand what he is saying

OO’ MEARA

Rory begs him with his eyes

OMEARA

Finally OMeara takes Rory’s hand and crosses himself

5)

OMEARA
Oh my God I am heartily sorry for having
offended thee

Rory reaches up and touches O’Meara’s face

OMEARA -
Are you sorry for all the sins of -your past
life
Rory nods
O’MEARA

Are you sorry for having offended Gad
He nods again
O’MEARA

Then in the name ofthe Father the Son
and the Holy Ghost

Rorys hand falls away as he dies OMearas voice drops

O’MEARA
1 absolve you

OMeara cradles him in his arms a father holding his dead son

CAMERA PULLS BACK INTO THE SKY LEAVING THEM SMALL FIGURES IN
THE VASTNESS OF SPACE AND SEA

FADE OUT
