She makes her way through the ornate statuary The

its eyes suddenly POP OPEN Its really a strange
TATTOOED MAN Several more of these hideous bald MEN
nearby They are the PRIESTS of Osiris Imhoteps guys
eyes watch Anck-su-namun vanish through the bedroom
Anck-su-namun embraces Imhotep they kiss passionately

feverishly Imhoteps hands roam over her perfect body
smearing the paint The Narrators VOICE fills with

NARRATOR

But for our love we were willing to

risk life itself
And we realize that the Narrator is actually Imhotep
on the other-side of the curtains the bald Priests

Through the

EXT SAND DUNES - NIGHT
Imhotep leads-a TORCH-LIT procession across the dunes
su-namuns mummy is carried by NUBIAN SLAVES They put

down in the sand along with FIVE JEWEL ENCRUSTED JARS

IMHOTEP
Her body was mummified her vital
organs removed and placed in sacred
canopic jars

Imhotep filled with dread reads from a OBOOKO made
pure GOLD THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE LIVING

sacred incantations that would send
the evil dead on a journey into the

ground

Imhoteps Priests place the body into a stone

The Nubian slaves lower it into a hole and bury it with
Imhotep then signals to the Soldiers who throw their
at the Nubians Killing them

IMHOTEP
The slaves were killed

Imhoteps knife-wielding Priests attack the now unarmed
Soldiers hacking at them in the flickering darkness as
Imhotep and the Mumia solemnly watches

IMHOTEP
and the soldiers who killed them
were also slain so that no unholy
person should ever know the exact
location of the burial site

The Mumia walk off across the sand and then one by

Priests stop their frenzied stabbing and stare off at

vanishing Mumia As the last Mumia disappears over a
dune Imhotep nods and the Priests leap onto Anck-su-
grave and begin digging it back up with their hands

In the middle of the circle is a strange twisted

Imhotep has unwrapped Anck-su-namuns gorgeous
body and placed her five sacred canopic jars around
IMHOTEP
Anck-su-namuns vital organs were
still fresh so a human sacrifice
would not need be made
As Imhotep begins to read from The Book of The Dead a
SWIRLING HOLE starts to open in the detritus bog
Priests look over at it frightened then quickly look
down and resume CHANTING A strange MIST wafts up out
swirling hole and over to the jars it passes through
and into Anck-su-namuns body One of the jars
heart inside begins to BEAT The CHANTING PRIESTS
HOLE WAFTING MIST BEATING HEART and IMHOTEPS
reaching a crescendo Anck-su-namuns EYES suddenly FLY
IMHOTEP
Anck-su-namun soul had come back
from the dead Now all that was
needed was to return her organs to

their rightful place within her body

Imhotep lifts a sacrificial knife above Anck-su-namuns
breast about to plunge it down The CHANTING SWIRLING

BEATING heart CLIMAX And thats when the Mumia BURST

The horrid-looking Embalmers using knives needles and

A red hot POKER is pulled out of a pit of burning

A Priests head is wedged between two strong boards
eyes widen in terror as an Embalmer moves to insert the
hot poker up his nose

But just before he does WE QUICKLY CUT TO IMHOTEPS
horrified as OFF CAMERA the Priest SCREAMS

WE GO WIDE on the chamber All twenty-one of Imhoteps

squirm inside their wrappings Imhotep is forced to his

muck boils inside a black cauldron Embalmers scoop out

fetid muck and apply it to Imhoteps wrappings as he

Hes then laid in a wooden COFFIN inside a stone

An Embalmer with a BUCKET steps up and looks into the

Imhoteps wild eyes stare back The Embalmer empties
bucket over Imhoteps chest dozens of SCARABS

Some vanish into his tongue-less mouth and up his

By eating the sacred scarabs I would
be cursed to stay alive forever And
by eating me they were cursed just
the same
The lid to the coffin is SLAMMED SHUT Then using a

four-sided KEY the Head Mumia locks the coffin lid

The heavy sarcophagus lid is shoved into place and with

loud WHOOSH seals itself airtight Once again the Head

He grins drunkenly Evelyn punches him hard in the
chest

EVELYN
Well I wish youd do it sooner rather
than later before you ruin my career
the way youve ruined yours

JONATHAN
My dear sweet baby sister Ill
have you know that at this moment
my career is on a high note

He BELCHES then falls back and sits on the edge of a
tomb

EVELYN
High note Ha For five years youve
been scrounging around Egypt and
what have you to show for it Nothing

Jonathan excitedly starts scrounging around in his
jacket

JONATHAN
Oh yes I do I have something right
here

EVELYN
Oh no not another worthless trinket
Jonathan if I bring one more piece
of junk to the Curator to try and
sell for you

Jonathan pulls out a small ancient BOX the collapsed
KEY

to Imhoteps sarcophagus and coffin Evelyn is
instantly

curious she grabs the box out of his hand

EVELYN
Where did you get this

Jonathan knows her weaknesses gives her a mischievous
smile

JONATHAN
On a dig down in Thebes

Evelyn rolls the box around in her hands mumbling to
herself

as she translates the hieratics and hieroglyphs
covering it

Jonathan licks his lips in anticipation

eyepiece at the keybox Evelyn hovers behind him

EVELYN
See the cartouche there its the
official royal seal of Seti the First
Im sure of it

CURATOR
Perhaps

Jonathan leans in from across the desk

JONATHAN
Two questions Who the hell is Seti
the First And was he rich

EVELYN
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old
Kingdom said to be the wealthiest
Pharaoh of them all

JONATHAN
Alright good thats good I like

this fellow like him very much

The Curator picks up the MAP Its actually the exact
map that we established in the opening scenes of the
movie

EVELYN
Ive already dated it this map is
almost four thousand years old And
the hieratics over here
(Inhales deeply)
Its Hamunaptra

The Curator freezes suddenly very nervous then he
recovers

CURATOR
My dear girl dont be ridiculous
we are scholars not treasure hunters
Hamunaptra is a myth

JONATHAN
Are we talking about the Hamunaptra

EVELYN
Yes The City of The Dead Where the
early Pharaohs were said to have
hidden the wealth of Egypt

JONATHAN
Right right in a big underground
treasure chamber Everybody knows
the story The entire necropolis was
rigged to sink into the sand On
Pharaohs command a flick of the
switch And the whole place could
disappear beneath the dunes

EVELYN
All we know is that the city
mysteriously vanished around 2134
BC

The Curator holds the map closer to the burning CANDLE-
LAMP

CURATOR
As the Americans would say its all
fairy tales and hokum

The map accidentally CATCHES ON FIRE The Curator
throws

it to the floor Jonathan drops to his knees and
quickly
now

snatches

look

Every

puts it out Lifts it up The left third of the map is
missing

You burned it You burned off the
part with the lost city

Its for the best Im sure Many
men have wasted their lives in the
foolish pursuit of Hamunaptra no
one has ever found it most have
never returned

JONATHAN
(devastated)
You killed my map

OCONNELL
Why would they bury somebody in the

EVELYN

They didnt they buried him at the

of great importance Or he did

something very naughty
INT SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY
The warden drops an amethyst-scarab into his pouch

Evelyn slaps his hand and quickly unfolds the box --

now shaped exactly like the LOCKS KEYHOLE Evelyn

Jonathan smiles at the bottle then turns the pouch

out and shakes it nothing but SAND is inside it

JONATHAN
Well he may have been a stinky

makes the sign of-the cross and blesses himself in

EXT CAIRO BAZAAR - NIGHT

A FULL MOON now shines down on the bazaar still
with activity Suddenly a BREEZE kicks-in GREEN MIST

begins

to SWIRL down the street and through the stalls The
people

begin to CHOKE and COUGH and RETCH as if being hit by
a

severe sickness -- its already too late

Imhotep strolls through the sickened mob his face half
rotted

off his deformed mouth grinning happily Beni is at
his

side looking very nervous

And then one-by-one the people silently begin to
follow

Imhotep their skin now covered in disgustingly hideous
BOILS

AND SORES

INT MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - NIGHT

OConnell Jonathan Daniels the Curator and Ardeth
Ray

follow Evelyn as she strides through the museum

EVELYN
Last month I came across an
inscription that mentioned The Book
Of The Dead

DANIELS
That book we found at Hamunaptra

EVELYN
Yes I dismissed it because it talked
about bringing people back from the
dead A notion I was unwilling to
believe

OCONNELL
Believe it sister Thats what
brought our buddy back to life

JONATHAN
And now hes going to use it to bring
his girlfriend back

ARDETH RAY
And if he succeeds the two of them
together will bring about the
apocalypse
The Curator joins Evelyn at her side as she heads up
the
stairs everyone else in hot pursuit

THE CURATOR
The plagues we have seen so far are
merely Imhotep flexing his muscles
Only at the moment of Anck-su-namuns
resurrection will he be truly
invincible

They reach the display cases Evelyn quickly opens
them

EVELYN
Im thinking that if the black Book
Of The Dead can bring people back to
life --

CURATOR
-- then perhaps the golden Book Of
The Living can return them to the
underworld

EVELYN
Exactly --

OCONNELL
So your sayin if we find the book
made outta gold --

CURATOR
-- And read the sacred incantations
contained inside it

OCONNELL
You think itll send this guy back
to hell

CURATOR
Correct And thats when --

LOUD CHANTING is heard coming from outside They all
rush

over to the upper windows and look down -- OUTSIDE A

The BANGING gets LOUDER Multiple windows SHATTER
talks while quickly translating the tablet

EVELYN
Since the black Book of The Dead was

Beni staggers across a chamber straining under the

weight

of another saddlebag filled with treasure He spots a
large

ornate STAFF sticking out of a wall He throws the
saddlebag

over the staff and collapses against the wall
Exhausted

A BEAT And then the weight of the treasure PULLS THE
STAFF

DOWN Which starts a massive AURAL CHAIN-REACTION

fear

of pouring sand Beni turns and hauls ass out of the

half gone its now only four feet high -- now three

Sealing him in Beni quickly crawls back down the

All the doorways FINISH CLOSING Theres no way out
