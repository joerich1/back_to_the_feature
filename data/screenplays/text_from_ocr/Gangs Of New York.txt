INT ROOM OLD BREWERY DAY

Half in shadow a man named VALLON dressed in black fastens a clean
white clerical collar around his thick neck He raises a jagged razor
to

his face RAKES it across his right cheek drawing BLOOD He does not
flinch

The sharp SCRAPING of the jagged blade against skin is the first SOUND
we

hear

VALLON cuts himself similarly on the left cheek then hands the razor
ceremoniously to a BOY standing beside him The boy no more than
twelve

years old looks at VALLON worshipfully keen eyes shining with fear
and
excitement He starts to wipe the razor blade on the bottom of his
jacket

VALLON
No Never The blood stays on the blade son

He hands the boy a dark red velvet pouch Very carefully the boy
known
as AMSTERDAM wraps the razor up hands it back to his father

From the shadows VALLON now raises a long pole with a beautiful
golden

crucifix mounted on the end then holds his free hand out to his son
Amsterdam squeezes tight

VALLON nods toward the door Amsterdam pulls it open Outside is a dim
hallway We hear SOUNDS that might be animal or human

MUSIC begins a steady driving cadence somewhere between a march and
a

hymn

CcuT TO
2 INT HALLWAY

VALLON strides in long measured steps Amsterdam has trouble keeping
up

with him

They are walking down a long corridor thats like a tunnel Patches of
LIGHT stain the darkness Sometimes Amsterdam glimpses a FACE peering
out
from the gloom Once or twice he almost stumbles over a BODY stretched

across his path

Priest
He joins the procession Another woman as tough as the first and half
again as large and several more men all armed with implements of
destruction fall in beside him Their faces are marked with blood
like

Vallans or covered with ritual markings made with paint and ink

The group grows ever larger and more forbidding occasionally PEOPLE
dart

around them in the tunnel and scamper out of their way like animals
frightened in a burrow

CcuT TO
5 INT ROOM

Vast and dank like a cavern We start CLOSE on

the body of a dead rat being filled with some pieces of lead
Then a little WIDER to reveal an eager boy SHANG DRAPER about the
same
age as Amsterdam He drops the last few pieces of lead into the mouth
of
the rat then sews it closed He hefts the animal by the tail
swinging it
as he stands up
He is near a primitive forge where a half-drunk SLACKSMITH hammers
crude
weapons into shape and distributes them to OTHER MEN and WOMEN The
floor
is covered with bits of lead and steel which Shang has been using to
sew
into his rat
Shang FOLLOWS the crowd of men and women with their weapons And now
we
see this room full It is huge the main room of the Old Brewery
crowded
with families huddled together for warmth and comfort or out of fear
men
and women together or separately drunk or passed out They are like
ZOO
animals in a pit There are sticks of furniture jammed in corners or
more often arranged at angles in the middle of the room to form tiny
enclaves where the ancient brewery machinery forms irregular
boundaries
bove Shangs head VALLON and his gang walk across a plank bridge
hat
pans the room a hundred feet beneath them Armed men and women from
he
rewery are climbing a rope ladder to join them Shang SCURRIES up
fter
hem
he men and women from the Brewery fall in behind VALLON and the
thers in
he lead Shang SPOTS someone near his own age toward the front

tOHt oO Wtunae Pp

Amsterdam He presses through the crowd like a hunting dog

SHANG
Whats the fight

AMSTERDAM

The Dead Rabbits against the Native Americans same as ever But itll
all

be settled today

SHANG
Are you Native or Rabbit

AMSTERDAM
(points to rabbit on pike)
What do you think

SHANG
Looks alright Ill stand by you then

CcuT TO
6 INT HALLWAY

The group now turns down the last corridor as dim and long as a
tunnel

In the distance theres a faint glimmer of light and the figure of a
MAN

(MONK EASTMAN) VALLON stops near the door

VALLON
I dont know you

MAN
(lightly)
I suppose theres to be a fight

VALLON catches the heavy Celtic inflection in the mans voice

VALLON
Derry

MAN
Donnegal Names Monk Eastman

VALLON
And you want to fight Mr Eastman

MONK
lf theres money in it
VALLON
Fight for the Natives They have a proper war chest

MONK

Well I might at that But I thought Id ask you first seeing as how
Im

not quite a Native American myself

VALLON
Lets see your skills and well talk of payment later

MONK

Fine But if you like what you see pay me double

Monk turns to the door with the grace of a dancer and delivers a
SHATTERING kick sending it flying off its hinges Clear white LIGHT
streams in and we see Monk Eastman plain for the first time a huge
man

in stature and girth wearing a small DERBY that intentionally makes
his

head look even bigger

VALLON
(as the door splinters settle)
Stand with us then

CcuT TO
7 EXT STREET DAY (WINTER)

WINTER WIND blows across a scene as strange and bleak as an alien
planet

VALLON carrying his cross high steps through the doorway The OTHERS
slowly follow VALLON out of the building which is three stories high
and

maybe a block long A dilapidated sign identifies it as the 5 Paints
Brewery

It is the tallest structure in the midst of low squalid SHACKS
winding

ALLEYS as narrow as a snakels back and DIRT STREETS filled with ruts
mud

and filthy snow A few PIGS wander forlornly about rooting for
garbage

WASH hangs stiff in the middle of the square from a peculiar
monument

erected to some forgotten war hero

The Brewery occupies one side of a SQUARE surrounded by some
storefronts

and a couple of collapsed wooden sidewalks If this place resembles
anything at all its a horrible hybrid of Londons Limehouse and a
pioneer town in the American West whose best days have long passed--or
never came at all

VALLON stands still staring across the square past the monument His
battalion of irregulars waits for his signal

Now very very sSlowlyfrom around both sides of the monument
comes

ANOTHER GANG in size the same as VALLONs men and women both armed
like

Visigoths with HOMEMADE WEAPONS knives pitchforks building blocks
and

bricks boards with sharp nails protruding from the ends Every member
of

this second group is dressed in a long DUSTER which reaches to the
ankles

Several MEN in front of the group sport dusters made of leather

VALLON

Bill Poole on whose challenge are we assembled

A MAN in a leather duster (BILL THE BUTCHER) steps forward He is
young

lean and fierce And then there are his eyes They do not match One
is

real The other is a huge bulging PEARL upon which has been engraved
instead of a pupil a full-color portrait of the AMERICAN EAGLE

On the side of the square arranged to get a good view of the
impending

combat is a group of STREET KIDS girls and boys none older than
eight

They talk and laugh excitedly among themselves picking their own
favorites among the gangs as if the warriors were players on a team

BILL THE BUTCHER

On the challenge of the Native Americans to settle for good and all
who

holds sway

VALLON
Bene

BILL THE BUTCHER

By the ancient laws of combat we offer our bodies to the ghosts of
those

warriors who have gone before us Valor is avid for glory and glory
is in

our wounds

VALLON

But this time can you bear to look on the glory when it comes Bill
Can

you see it clear with your single eye

BILL THE BUTCHER
Whoever fights untouched in battle has skill but the warrior who
returns
wounded has been touched by God

VALLON
It wasnt God who touched your eye

BILL THE BUTCHER

It was God gave me guidance Will you be able to look on the death
blow

like a gladiator and not look away No honorable man turns an eye
from

his death

VALLON
I dont expect a death blow from your hand Butcher Lets have at it

BILL THE BUTCHER
There is another matter

VALLON
Say it out and quick before spring gets here

BILL THE BUTCHER
No Native American Warrior will dishonor himself with the blood of the
halt and maimed

VALLON
So

BILL THE BUTCHER

So we would like to know whether Squire Jack Mulraney of the Dead
Rabbits

can smile out of both sides of his face

A pause of a single second Then HAPPY JACK takes the dead rabbit off
the

tip of his pike and hurls it across the square It lands right at BILL
THE

BUTCHERs feet

In a flash BILL THE BUTCHER opens his coat Inside on a special belt
he
carries a CLEAVER a CARVING KNIFE and other instruments of the
butcherls

trade all stained with blood and gristle Now the MAN standing next
to
him removes the broad BELT from around his coat The brass buckle is
sharpened to a point the leather studded with glass

The gallery of Street Kids tenses for action they are thrilled

VALLON reaches up to the CROSS pulls off the top piece to disclose
underneath a gleaming sword point He folds the arms of the cross
down

like the blades of a jackknife
VALLON
Prepare to receive the Lord

And the air is full of screams and battle cries as the two gangs hurl
across Paradise Square into BATTLE

VALLON draws first blood He impales a Native American on the sword
end of

his cross and turns to fight again

Amsterdam and Shang exchange a glance of frightened worried wonder

hen a Native American rushes at them shouting for blood The boys

Q
co

ogether Amsterdam dives down in front of the man sending him
prawling

hang BLUDGEONS the fallen warrior using his lead-filled rat like a
lackjack as Amsterdam kicks him savagely the Native collapses
nconscicus at their feet Before the boys can thank one another
owever

hey are separaten by the SURGING GANGS all around them

ILL THE BUTCHER leaves his meat CLEAVER imbedded in the middle of a

oo

kull then WADES through the combat as if shielded by a charm
he gallery of Street Kids is thrilled by this display and reacts with
CHEERS

HuBbBwdeteayrse 7HnHNtAH

VALLON BATTLES three Natives who come at him at once

Monk Eastman grabs a Native in his arms like a groom hugging a bride
He

raises his knee and brings the man crashing down across it BREAKING
his

spine like a Thanksgiving wishbone

The gallery of Street Kids is awed by this display of power from a new
star in the making

The Rabbit Warrior in the home-made armor grins at an intrepid Native
and

lowers his battle-axe The Native rushes as the

Rabbit Warrior swings and SEPARATES the man from his legs

A NATIVE WOMAN lowers her head and charges her Dead Rabbit adversary
delivering a shattering BUTT to his stomach

A NATIVE BOY holds a rusty old pistol which he uses at pointblank
range
against several Rabbits

A RABBIT WOMAN flies into a Native using her IRON FINGER EXTENSIONS
to
GOUGE his face
The NATIVE with the deadly belt uses it to TEAR a piece out of a
Rabbits
face

Amsterdam beginning now to be overwhelmed by the hellish fight looks
around in growing PANIC for his father

SHANG uses his lead-rat blackjack to clear an escape back toward the
Brewery The Street Kids can tell hes trying to escape and start

BOOING
him

as Shangs GRABBED from behind and pulled off his feet by a PEG-
LEGGED

NATIVE He THROWS the boy to the ground and pins him by holding the
sword-sharp point of his wooden leg against Shangs throat

SHANG

(desperate)

I run with you Im one of you Born a Native American from the blood
of

five generations

PEG-LEG
Yeah Then you oughta be a red Indian

He pushes down Shang starts to bleed But now PEG LEG is distracted

by

the sudden SOUND of bells and whistles He watches the BOY trembling
on

the ground then moves off him making for the sound of the bell
leaving

the BOY quaking

The SOUND grows louder as TWO HORSE-DRAWN CARTS full of battle ready
POLICE tear around the curve of a narrow thoroughfare and stop in
Paradise

Square

The BELLS on the carts toll loudly and work magic The fighting stops

The POLICE all carrying clubs and wearing leather helmets LEAP OFF
the
wagons

There are several moments of ABSOLUTE SILENCE broken only by the
SOUND of

the wind and the GROANS of the wounded

Then as one the Dead Rabbits and the Native Americans RUSH the
police

together hurtling stones and brandishing weapons Even the Street
Kids

get into the act kicking and biting and generally having a fine time
The gangs SWARM all over the police driving them back Some lucky
cops

climb back on the wagons and try to get away The unlucky police
remain

behind dead on the ground

The GANGS cheer jeer and continue to throw things at the retreating
POLICE When the second wagon disappears from view the GANGS confront
each other once again

Another brief moment of QUIET The Street Kids settle back into their
spectator role Then the GANGS go at each other with fresh intensity
Amsterdam finally SEES his father and starts to PUSH his way toward
him
VALLON and BILL THE BUTCHER stand facing each other in the midst of
battle
like two titans then they rush at each other joining with a terrible
fury
Shang still blindly SWINGING his blackjack makes his way closer to
the
relative safety of the Brewery his face stained with tears of fear
He
hits someone The MAN turns swats him down Shang sprawls on the
street

which is a SWAMP of mud and blood and dirty snow and finds himself
face

to face with a departed PEG LEG Someone has removed his artificial
Limb

and driven it through his heart

Across the square Amsterdam has reached his father in time to see a
NATIVE AMERICAN sneaking up behind him Amsterdam grabs a long
TRUNCHEON

from a fallen warrior and uses it to hit the man a strong blow behind
the

knees

The MAN falls howling AMSTERDAM HITS him again And again He is
hysterical

VALLON and BILL THE BUTCHER keep fighting Amsterdam sees with a
single
look that his father is in the fight of his life He looks for a
weapon
to help

sees a HATCHET lying by the body of the Rabbit he has just beaten
senseless He grabs it and runs forward looking for an opening
between
the Butcher and his father
As the two combatants move Amsterdam MOVES Bobbing weaving
feinting
falling back looking for his chance

as Bill deals VALLON a blow that ROCKS him back and throws him off
balance

just as Amsterdam has made his move He RUSHES forward sees his
father
FALLING tries to turn but
too late The boys hatchet SLASHES his father in the leg VALLON
falls to one knee gestures frantically to the stunned Amsterdam to
get
away

and Bill is upon VALLON SINKING his knife into his chest VALLON
screams and falls on his back Bill kneeling over him He looks into
his

enemys eyes and VALLONs EYES LOCK ON HIS For all his suffering
VALLONs eyes HOLD Bill he forces himself to look at Billits a
terrible struggle but VALLON will not look away

Amsterdam hysterical RUSHES at the Butcher The Butcher grabs
Amsterdam
by the arm making him drop his hatchet

BILL THE BUTCHER

You need a weapon Use a knife

He puts the struggling boys hand on the hilt of the knife that the
Butcher sunk into his fathers chest

BILL THE BUTCHER

It makes a deeper cut

And HIS HAND GUIDING THE BOYS he RAMS his knife deep into VALLONs
heart

BILL THE BUTCHER
Say a benediction Priest

VALLON bellows in agony Amsterdam screams at the very same moment
his
cry mingling with his fatherls tearing through the air

BILL THE BUTCHER

(to Amsterdam)

Hold this close to mind boy should you ever think of going up
against

the Native Americans

Bill the Butcher rises and all around him as if on some mysterious
signal the fighting subsides A DEAD RABBIT sees the fallen Vallon
takes

a battered brass HORN from his belt and sounds THREE NOTES quick and
sharp As the notes fade away the fighting stops completely

BILL THE BUTCHER
(announcing)
Ears and noses will be trophies of the day

The Rabbits SCAMPER to collect their dead and wounded before the
Natives

can get to them to slice off the battle souvenirs But there are many
corpses maimed The Street Kids DISPERSE The main battle is over and
the
Natives have clearly carried the day

The Rabbits file past Vallon rorming a protective CIRCLE around him
Amsterdam kneels at his side Vallon tries to speak Blood bubbles in
his

throat

VALLON

Cantcant cross the river with steel through my heart
Amsterdam looks around None of the Rabbits makes a move This is
clearly

something he is meant to do himself

Amsterdam grabs the tortoise handle of the knife PULLS on it Vallon
tries not to cry out The knife does not move

Amsterdam tries again He cant budge the knife Vallon MOANS Nearly
wild Amsterdam PULLS with all his strength Vallon SCREAMS in agony
Amsterdam is pulling so hard he raises his fathers back four inches
off

the ground Still the knife will not move Vallon passes out from the
pain

Now finally someone steps forward Monk Eastman He leans over but
Amsterdam berserk with grief pushes him away turns back to his
father

and with a last desperate pull DRAWS the knife from his fathers
heart

He throws it on the ground Monk picks it up wipes the blade on his
arm

closes the knife and hands it to Amsterdam

MONK

Thats yours rightfully

Now Monk leans over the lifeless body and reaches inside Vallons
coat

REMOVING some money

MONK
And this is mine Only whats owed Use the rest for funeral

AMSTERDAM

No

He tries to shove Monk away from his father when the Native Warrior
intervenes

HAPPY JACK
Its fair

Amsterdam wild with shock and grief turns back to his father as Monk
takes whats owed him Amsterdam bends over to KISS Vallon on both
cheeks

then on his left eye

The boy is just about to kiss his fatheros closed right eye when the
lid
springs OPEN - Amsterdam jumps back despite himself Vallon stares at
him

a last moment of recognition

VALLON

Hon

AMSTERDAM

No Pa

VALLON
honor me think of me dont never look away
Vallon convulses and DIES Amsterdam shakes him to revive him

RABBIT WOMAN

Take the body Bring the boy

Several RABBITS take a step or two forward but Amsterdam springs up
at

them like an animal

RABBIT WARRIOR
Come an lad Therels nothing to be done now

AMSTERDAM
Get away Get away

HAPPY JACK
Leave him be Hes his to mourn

And the RABBITS turn away going back to the Old Brewery or vanishing
down

the narrow streets

Now a few CITIZENS venture out into Paradise square A couple of
SCAVENGERS scoot about looting bodies

Amsterdam stays in the center of the square unmoving undisturbed
keeping

solitary vigil over his father

A TITLE is superimposed across this scene
NEW YORK CITY 1844
8 EXT HARBOR DAY WINTER (MATTE)

The same afternoon As the sun goes down we have our first full look
(MATTE) at the low pale outlines of the city

The harbor is crowded with the high masts of sailing ships Just north
of

the island tip is the steeple of the citys tallest structure Trinity
Church The buildings of Wall Street are masses of concrete and wood
the

streets surrounding them paved with cobblestones Just above the
financial
district are the sloping buildings and rutted avenue of the Five
Points

The Old Brewery stands tall and forbidding over Paradise Square
Above the Five Points in the distance we can glimpse some finer
newer

buildings One wide street--Broadway--seems to run from the very tip
of

the island clear up into the woods just a few miles north of the
harbor

The only SOUNDS are the lapping of the harbor water against the boats
the

creaking of masts in the winter WIND

CcuT TO
9 EXT HARBOR DAY

A closer view - The TITLE fades off We see an imposing edifice on the
edge of the harbor with a wooden sign identifying IMMIGRATION
DEPARTMENT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

The sun has nearly set A boy--about 10 years old--sits on the edge of
the

Castle Garden dock gazing down at the frozen Hudson He can just
about

make out his reflection in the dull sheen of the ice His name is
JOHNNY

SIROCCO and he watches himself with bewildered seriousness

Abruptly he reaches down and SMASHES through the ice with his fist
In

SLOW MOTION we watch the ice fragments drift apart in the river
current

each bearing away a REFLECTION of Johnnyls face like pieces of a
puzzle

POLICEMAN
Wheres your family sonny

Johnny sees a POLICEMAN scrutinizing him

JOHNNY
(lilting brogue)
My mothers just there

He gestures toward a ship where MEN are unloading cargo In a hoist
they
are lowering a thin pine COFFIN to dockside

JOHNNY

On the trip her insides all broke up She wasnt dead and there was
three

others fighting for her bed
POLICEMAN
And your father Wheres he then

JOHNNY
I never knew him

POLICEMAN
(taking Johnnys hand)

We better see to you then
CUT TO
10 EXT STREET NIGHT

The Policeman leads an awed Johnny through the TEEMING streets of the
Five
Points

POLICEMAN

Where all those streets come together right ahead is the true Five
Points

But most speak of the Five Points and mean anywhere between the
Battery

and the Bowery

Although the nights cold the streets are jammed WHORES painted like
carnival Gypsies sell themselves to any man sober enough to stand up
SOUNDS of laughter and combat filter out from garish SALOONS like the
Little Naples the Hell Hole the Egyptian Hall

In the midst of all this highlife are BEGGARS and the SICKLY looking
for

charity scrounging garbage in the street An INDIGENT battles a
CRIPPLE

for a meager scrap of faod A richly dressed WOMAN riding by in a
carriage hides her eyes by raising a HUGE BOUQUET OF FLOWERS in front
of

her face

POLICEMAN

Streets hereabouts are lively of an evening The city comes here to
sport

But theres places to put up a boy on his own

Three WOMEN exquisitely costed burst from the door of the Egyptian
Hall
Under the harsh glare of a nearby gas lamp their faces are no longer
striking Johnny STARES there is something not right about these

faces

JOHNNY
And those What are those

POLICEMAN
Well those Those are as you might say a sort of

We SEE one of the womens faces suddenly harsh under gaslight under
thickly caked make-up is a smiling TRANSVESTITE

POLICEMAN
sort of whatnot

TRANSVESTITE
Say policeman Ill buy your bonny friend

The Policeman fetches the Transvestite a strong WHACK with his
nightstick
The Transvestite screams and falls and Johnny RUNS

POLICEMAN
Hey

But Johnnys off already lost in the mad street life

a

bemused almost schalarly interest in the goings-on next door

This mortuary is located next to a bordello where the windows are
uncurtained and the energy and variety of the

activities inside is astounding

Tweed finally TURNS as Killoran opens the door

TWEED

14 INT MORTUARY NIGHT

Two native Americans open the door where Vallon is laid out and Bill
the

Butcher STRIDES into the room

There is immediate TENSION like an electric charge as other Natives
stand in the doorway and crowd the hall stand while Bill walks over to
the

coffin He places a BLACK ROSE in Vallons folded hands

BILL THE BUTCHER

Tomorrow your cortege will cross Paradise Square into territory
protected

by the Native Americans You will be permitted undisputed passage both
ways That is our tribute After that any Rabbits wishing to join the
Native Americans and willing to swear blood loyalty will be welcomed
All

The Friend GETS UP and starts across the Brewery floor acting

But she looks around her across the sleeping passed-out bodies past

A man and two women cast a glance her way She looks away but the

TWEED
Youre a lunatic to come here like

In the background same of the NATIVES have begun to play CATCH by
removing the CANARY CAGES from their places and tossing them all over

BILL THE BUTCHER
Thank you Just listen good The Native Americans holds the Five

We have prevailed What you do outside the Points is your deciding
Outside is your city Inside the Points is mine Anyone who says

We work for no one

BOSS TWEED

And
for a satisfactory Im prepared even to say equitable financial

Maybe you Tammany boys should do your own lifting and carrying and
muscle

BOSS TWEED

Wed like to I do miss it But its wiser for men in the public life
to

BILL THE BUTCHER
Then get cops to do it

BOSS TWEED

Oh Jesus no The appearance of law must be upheld especially while
its

being broken

BILL THE BUTCHER
Appearance means nothing

BOSS TWEED
Perhaps not within the Points But the smart man could go higher

Bill looks at Tweed for a long moment The he SHOVES himself away from

26 EXT STREET NIGHT

A small slum thoroughfare congested by a splendid FIRE-WAGON labeled
Americus CoTammany Hall Curious SPECTATORS and panic-stricken
RESIDENTS crowd around to watch a ramshackle building going up in
FLAMES

As Johnny presses through the crowd to get a good look at the fire
Tweed

in a white coat and fancy fire helmet steps off the fire wagon to
address

an ONLOOKER

TWEED
Anyone inside

ONLOOKER
No praise God but all we own
TWEED places a bucket over the only fire plug in the vicinity then
sits
on it

ONLOOKER
Well

TWEED
Waiting on reinforcements

The SOUND of another bell nearby Down the street from the opposite
direction come TWO MORE FIRE-WAGONS The crowd starts cheering Tweed
does

not move from the plug

TWEED

Thats not them Its only the Black Jokes Seems your fire
interrupted

their festivities

The wagons pull up next to the fire plug Each of them has the words
Black Joke Fire Co written large on the side but the FIREMEN wear
party costumes not regular uniforms Some are dressed as British
Redcoats still others as Indians

The FLAMES continue to devour the building but Tweed does not budge
from
the plug He is approached by the Black Jake chief who is dressed as
an

ndian chief

CHIEF
May I point out that the building is burning to ashes

TWEED

Certainly And may I then remind you Pocahontas that this entire
area is

the province of the Americus company and you will kindly keep your
distance

Impasse The rival Fire Companies size each other up and start toward
each

other The building continues to burn Tweed remains regal and
unperturbed

atop the fire plug

As the two COMPANIES are about to close with each other a second BELL
sounds Tweeds reinforcements have arrived the Native Americans
led

by Bill The Butcher They PILE OFF the wagons before the horses halt
Now

the Black Joke Co is outnumbered and it FALLS BACK As the Crowd
CHEERS

Tweed takes the bucket off the fire plug
TWEED
Alright boys To work

The MEN of the Americus Co give a great SHOUT and start firefighting
a

hose is hitched up to the plug buckets are filled a primitive pump
sends

water spluttering everywhere

But there is not much blaze left to combat and the Men quickly grow
frustrated Tweed realizes this immediately

TWEED
Next building over boys Mustnt let it spread

The men charge into a neighboring building STOMPING down doors
CLIMBING

through windows and SWINGING AXES with gusto all to save a building
that

is in no danger at all

A local poll named DANIEL KILLORAN detaches himself from the crowd and
approaches Tweed giving him a hearty SLAP on the back

KILLORAN
Another proud night for Tammany Bill

TWEED
Just tell them
(lowers his voice)
to take enough to share And not to steal so in the open

Indeed the Men are leaving the building with lots of LOOT CITIZENS
who

question their right to do this are promptly KNOCKED DOWN Killoran
GRABS

Bill The Butcher as he rushes by

TWEED

Jesus Boss says to tell you to fight the fire from the front and loot
out

the back

Bill grins and leaves to spread the word as an angry WOMAN approaches
Tweed

TEARFUL WOMAN
The Black Joke could have saved my house

TWEED
Black Joke had no business here Madam

TEARFUL WOMAN
Their business was to save my house
TWEED

Thats the prize of the month Spice Islands silk

He puts the scart in his coat pocket with a FLOURISH then throws his
arm
about Jenny in a proprietary way

SHANG
Youll learn our way if youre going to be one of us Amsterdam

Jenny reacts slightly to the mention of the name she looks over and
RECOGNIZES Amsterdam now

SHANG

Every one of us gives a portion of all they steal to the gang Morts
more

than men being morts

AMSTERDAM
Yeah And why is that

SHANG

Because morts have more resources Men can work only on their feet
but a

mort can turn out on her back

I mean why give at all Why dont they keep for themselves

If you think theres something off about my way of running things you
got

no place in this gang

I got no place anyway and you got no gang This aint a gang no
matter

what you say Its a mob

Theres a tense hush in the grubby room Shang takes his arm from
around
Jenny wanting to be restrained

Its all your play now Shang Maybe you can set him right

Jenny hands him a cane Barely managing to hide his reluctance he
starts--slowly--toward Amsterdam who stands his ground The gang
steps

back to give them room in this tiny space Shang pulls the cane apart
its a SWORD CANE but Amsterdam shows no fear He shifts his weight a
little watching and theyre interrupted by a

offers but several of the purses and wallets Jenny delivered Jenny
stares at him with contempt and he laughs tossing one of the purses
back

at her

Jack turns to leave but a BRASH BOY blocks his way Moving fast and

Jack bashes the Boy to the floor with his nightstick

HAPPY JACK
Anybody else Any number at all come on

Several of the gang make a move toward Jack but Shang WAVES them
back
Jack departs UNHARMED to general disgust Jenny walks back across the

A shock of summer SUNLIGHT as Amsterdam emerges from one of the back
entrances of the Brewery onto a fetid alley filled with rotted
barrels

broken glass and insensible drunks

Amsterdam looks carefully up and down the alley letting his eyes
adjust
to the bright light Ahead of him he SEES

Shang Draper in jovial conversation with a SECOND MAN we do not
recognize The man is bareheaded and has a deep scar running back to
front clear down the center of his bald head Amsterdam waits
WATCHES

Shang takes the RED SILK SCARF he got from Jennys swag and hands it
to
the Second Man He and Shang SHAKE HANDS as if they have concluded a

43 INT- RECEPTION ROOM AND TWEEDS OFFICE DAY

The main room is as loud and as prosperous as the stock exchange Bill
the

Butcher makes his way past Small GROUPS of men engaged in heated
political

dealings of dubious virtue

Bill knocks on the door to Tweeds private office while hes opening
it

Inside is Boss Tweed seated in a large WOODEN BOX like a primitive
sauna

Around him are various PETITIONERS and his assistant Daniel Killoran

TWEED
I dread city stimmers They bring illness and beget vermin

PETITIONER 1 (GLEASON)
My plague box fends off all pestilence Its elixir combats ill
humors

KILLORAN
We cant have every citizen of the Five Points boxed up like cargo

TWEED
But the season is vicious and I must take thought of our
constituents
Mr Gleason Id like you to shake hands with Mr Barnett Baff

Gleason dubious shakes hands with PETITIONER 2 as Bill the Butcher
looks on with amusement

TWEED

A friend and owner of an estimable carting service Work out an
arrangement whereby the citizenry can receive the benefit of Mr
Gleasons

wondrous elixir outside this excellent box At a cost Mr Gleason of
how

much the barrel

GLEASON
(figuring rapidly)
Oh perhaps twenty-five dollars

TWEED
and how much Mr Baff for haulage and distribution

BAFF
The same again At least

TWEED

At least Thats a price of fifty dollars And greedy low piracy at
that

(Gleason and Baff splutter)

But a price that Tammany in its generosity will meet Merely submit
a
bill for a hundred Well each have half And Ill retain this box for
further experiment Hello Bill

Killoran LEADS the astonished Gleason and Baff away as Bill
APPROACHES

TWEED
Bolt the door

Bill complies As Tweed speaks and the anti-plague VAPORS SWIRL around
his
head he keeps his eyes closed

TWEED
Scotchy Lavelles gone wrong in his accounts

BILL THE BUTCHER
I know Scotchys a good man

TWEED

Not good enough to rake thirty percent of our share from Sparrows and
use

it for his own

(opens his eyes)

You got to give him over Bill

BILL THE BUTCHER

I cant do that No matter what he steals I still get more from him
than

any two others As do you

TWEED

Alright then What about Charles McGloin Hes running a panel game
off to

one side Did you know that

(Bill shrugs)

I cant get a days work done for all the good citizens pouring in
here
complaining about crime and corruption all over the Points They
accuse
Tammany of carelesoness Some even suspect a few practically
suggest
(eying Bill significantly)

our complicity with this rampant criminality We must show them
Tammany stands behind the letter of the law We need to set an
example
BILL THE BUTCHER

Charles McGloin will do

TWEED
Ill set the trial for Friday

CcuT TO
44 EXT- TOMBS DAY

CAMERA moves high along the outside wall past small rectangular slits
that pass for jail windows EYES peer out as if a peep show is
underway

directly below in the Tombs courtyard A PRISONER is being readied for
the

gallows by having a hood tied to his head

The CROWD is in a carnival mood HOT CORN GIRLS STREET VENDORS
HOKEY-POKEY (ie ice cream) MERCHANTS even BUSKERS all add to
the

holiday spirit

Jenny works through the crowd pushing and smiling her way past groups
of

raucous merrymakers She stops once or twice to have a word with a
GENTLEMAN flirts for a moment then moves on

Further back in the crowd Amsterdam NOTICES her He watches her go
through the crowd with an admiration that quickly turns to FASCINATION
as

he realizes what shes doing picking pockets The best bludget in the
Five Points He starts to FOLLOW her

Jenny has worked her way close to the hanging platform but shes so
intent on her job she has not noticed Amsterdam The closer the
platform

the closer the spectacle and richer the pickings Jennys
concentration is

absolute On the platform an ASSISTANT HANGMAN addresses the Crowd

ASSISTANT HANGMAN
Those interested in the effects of the condemned please come forward
44

Part of the Crowd PRESSES in toward the platform temporarily blocking
Amsterdams view of Jenny He is right against the platform

ASSISTANT HANGMAN
What am I bid for this coat A coat of some wear but excellent cut
containing a rather remarkable pocket silk

MAN IN CROWD
Bid a quarter

HANGMAN
A quarter thank you Do I hear fifty cents Fifty cents

The Hangman is holding up the condemned mans coat which contains the
RED

SILK SCARF Amsterdam saw Shang give away Amsterdam flips the HANGMAN
a

quarter reaches out and GRABS the handkerchief

AMSTERDAM
Here Just for the silk

He stuffs it into his pocket and starts to PUSH his way through the
crowd

On the platform the WARDEN steps forward holding a primitive
megaphone

WARDEN
Do you have any last remarks Charles McGloin

McGloin grunts from underneath the hood

MCGLOIN
Not from under this hood I dont

Crowd near the platform begins to CHANT No hood no hood no hood
The
Warden puts his hand on the hood starts to remove it

and the Crowd CHEERS Amsterdam turns SEES Charles McGloin
Bald
with a deep scar running front to back on his head The very SAME MAN
he
saw in the alley with Shang

McGloin acknowledges the cheers of the crowd The Warden holds to
megaphone close and McGloin bellows

MCGLOIN
I never struck a foul blow or turned a card and may God greet me as a
friend

The Crowd ROAR approval at these words Amsterdam PUSHES through the
crowd looking for Jenny SPOTTING her finally

while up on the platform the NOOSE is placed around McGLOINs
neck
and he is HOISTED UP in no time We hear his neck SNAP His feet kick
after death The Crowd raises a zighty cheer

CcuT TO
45 EXTINT BROADWAY AND BROADWAY STAGE DAY

Amsterdam walks with a crowd toward a waiting Broadway stage a
vehicle

that looks like a horsedrawn train car The stage will take spectators
back uptown from the hanging

He is working his way toward Jenny who is now BOARDING the stage
Amsterdam DASHES through the crowd and SQUEEZES onto the stage which
moves forward with a JOLT

Once on board Amsterdam looks through the jammed car SEES Jenny
about

to sit down - A MAN has offered her his seat She smiles dazzlingly as
she

sits

and arranges her hands genteelly on her lap The Man looks down on
her
and she smiles up at him again He is bequiled

Amsterdam manages to get a little closer

MAN
I hope you wont think me rude if I speak

JENNY
No sir You look a proper Gentleman down to the ground

As this conversation continues we watch-not only Jenny and The Man in
conversation and Amsterdam watching them but we begin to notice what
Amsterdam SEES Although Jennys hands apparently remain folded on her
lap her RIGHT HAND moves SLOWLY out from her wrap toward The
Man

MAN
Well I wouldnt want you to think me forward you see

and BRUSHES past his jacket He does not notice or feel a thing
Jennys hand GLIDES past his THIGH nearly brushing it moving
up
across his pelvis and around his buttocks

JENNY
Does it matter to you what I think

MAN
Well I might like it to

JENNY
Oh

toward his pocket The Man is in Jennys thrall He feels nothing
and

continues to have no idea what is going on But Amsterdam KNOWS Every
silken surreptitious move of her HAND across The Mans body is like a
CARESS that Amsterdam can feel Jennys grace is balletic and EROTIC
As

she picks The Mans pocket she is without knowing it also seducing
Amsterdam

MAN
I mean if you would like

JENNY
I might like sir But I cant say now

Her hand HOVERS above his pocket waiting for the SWAY of the stage to
match and mask her movement

MAN
Why

and she starts to get up as soon as the stage JOSTLES The entire
car
full of passengers LEANS into one another

and Jennys hand SLIDES the Mans WALLET from his trousers as

he recovers his balance Amsterdam watches her withdraw her HAND in a
flash and hide it beneath her wrap

JENNY
Because this is my stop

MAN

May I walk with you a little then
JENNY

(firmly)

That would be too bold
MAN
But Ill never see you again

JENNY
I come every Thursday to the Tombs to see my father

MAN
Ill look for you

Jenny fetches him another fine SMILE--its almost demure--and takes
her
way off the rear entrance of the stage

lt PULLS AWAY up Broadway and Jenny walks briskly toward an alley
CUT TO
46 EXT ALLEYBROADWAY DAY

Jenny looks to make sure she has the alley to herself then moves her
body
a little

and her arms seem to come off She has been wearing a set of
ARTIFICIAL ARMS hollow inside which she can leave folded on her lap
misleadingly while she goes about her pickpocketing

Shes folding up the appliance--cotton sewn over a soft form-when a
VOICE

behind her makes her turn

AMSTERDAM
May I walk with you a little then

CcuT TO
47 EXT BROADWAY DAY

As Jenny and Amsterdam walk through the noisy bustle of the citys

JENNY

HANGERS-ON UPTOWN THRILL-SEEKERS JOURNALISTS and COPS not all of
them

off duty The SOUND of the place is a cacophony of SHOUTING SINGING
GAMBLING and STRANGE MUSIC--which we cant identify at first We START
CLOSE on a huge ruby ring and we HEAR

BOSS TWEED
(V0)
Read what it says there alongside the rubyread it out

and WE MOVE OUT as a WELL-WISHER reads the Latin inscription

WELL-WISHER
Fortuna Juvat Ordentes

TWEED

A grand victory gift from the men of Tammany Now tell em what it
means

Mayor Wood

WOOD
Fortune favors the bold

TWEED gives him a resounding slap on the back

BOSS TWEED
What do you think Would that make a fit motto for our fair City

WOOD
Well I could certainly see

KILLORAN
(interrupting)
Weve got a motto

BOSS TWEED

what is it

(no one knows)

Well hell lets get one we can remember Were going to build a new
City

hall we better have something to put over the front door And Mayor
youll make sure the Latins right

As Wood nods his assent CAMERA MOVES across room
past the gilded CAGES suspended ten feet over the floor where the
women and children look down at the action just below them with a
mixture
of trepidation and resignation Occasionally a REVELER will jump up to
try
and GRAB one of the caged inhabitants Still MOVING CAMERA

passes a stage where we finally SEE the source of all the strange
MUSIC weve been hearing the music is provided by

CHINESE MUSICIANS a woman SINGER a DANCER and some ACROBATS They
perform some weird mangled Five Points version of Chinese opera The
music and performance continues as we MOVE PAST

across a PEWTER FAN-TAN TABLE where CHINESE GAMBLERS play with
fierce
animation and concentration By comparison the Occidental types
playing
beside them seem like tourists

Everyone SHOUTS and SCRAMBLES to place bets with the FAN-TAN DEALER

Above the Dealer is an oval opening in the ceiling through which
OTHER

PLAYERS may watch the action below These FAN-TAN PLAYERS lean over an
elegantly carved rail peering at the action on the table below
placing

their bets and collecting their winnings by means of a BASKET attached
to

WIRES that whirrs constantly overhead We continue to MOVE PAST

until we are at the door of the place where Amsterdam Johnny and
the
Rabbits are having words with a BOUNCER

BOUNCER
I dont know you you dont enter

AMSTERDAM

(enjoying himself)

Come on what are you saying If you dont know us now youll know us
tomorrow and youll be working for us next week

JOHNNY
(more temperate)
Daniel Killoran knows us

BOUNCER
Oh he does

JOHNNY
We work for him
AMSTERDAM
The hell we do

JOHNNY
(to Amsterdam)
Tampen down will you

BOUNCER
Why dont you all get the hell out of here and go fix on a story Go
on

He SHOVES Johnny who STUMBLES back into Amsterdam Theyre both mad
now
and they step forward together toward the Bouncer

until Killoran intervenes

KILLORAN

(to Bouncer)

Its all right Nat Theyre saying the truth They gave a good days
work

for a good wage

Killoran HANDS OVER a paper-wrapped parcel of money which Amsterdam
takes
firmly

KILLORAN
A fine first showing But second best

AMSTERDAM
Second eh You dont say so

KILLORAN

Its no shame to be bested by veterans The Native Americans always
sweep

the field

AMSTERDAM
What

KILLORAN
We count on them sure as mass comes an Sunday

AMSTERDAM
(to Johnny glaring)
Did you know this Is this some scheme of yours

JOHNNY
No I didnt have no idea
AMSTERDAM
was working the same side as the Natives The Natives

KILLORAN

Thats only right Bill the Butchers our ambassador throughout the
Points as you might say Its deemed an honor to work with him
Everyone

nows Bill Poole everyone fears him everyone

AMSTERDAM

sure as hell dont fear him And I sure as hell wont stand with
him or

any who calls him one of theirs

KILLORAN

Well if its matter of personal honor the money can only be a
further

insult I have no wish to rile you further so if youll allow me

He REACHES to take back the parcel of money but Amsterdam BATS his
hand
away

AMSTERDAM
Where is he Wheres Bill the Butcher

KILLORAN

Listen buck This is a Tammany night If you and Bill Poole have
matters

to settle you can do it any other time any other place I dont give
a

good dancing goddamn But you do it here tonight and all the Five
Points

will be down on you like the righteous wrath of heaven or you could
as

the Book says put away childish things Join the celebration
Personally

I always find the least strenuous solution the most appealing Dont
you

Amsterdam stares at him as we
CUT TO
65 INT SPARROWS CHINESE PAGODA

As a CHINESE ACROBAT TWIRLS in the air off the stage and lands in
the

middle of the audience The crowd is raucously appreciative as the
Acrobat

does GYMNASTIC MOVES among them
past a table where the Dead Rabbits have settled it is later in
the
evening and everyone has been drinking
Amsterdam sullen intense WATCHES

-Bill the Butcher across the room He is like a prince regent
Everyone

pays him court including several uniformed COPS TAMMANY HANGERS-ON
and

NEWSPAPERMEN Bill receives the attention as his due

while Amsterdam keeps watching contempt and hatred gleaming in
his
eye He pays attention to none of the gang around including Jenny
Johnny
takes advantage of the situation

JOHNNY
I got experience Its the education I lack

JENNY
And you heard I was a good teacher

JOHNNY

I dont listen to talk I figure for myself And I figured youd be
good

at everything you did

JENNY
Thats right

JOHNNY
And tonight I got the ned

JENNY
And now what

JOHNNY
Now Im ready for you Unless theres an arrangement between you and
Amsterdam

JENNY
(glancing over at Amsterdam)
Not to my thinking

JOHNNY
(needs to be sure)
Amsterdam listen up Amsterdam

Amsterdam glances over at them

JENNY
(to Johnny)

You going with me or him Its my thinking matters here You dont
have to

ask him nothing

AMSTERDAM
What

JOHNNY
(makes his decision)
Hows the evening passing

AMSTERDAM
Fine Why

JOHNNY
(puts his arm around Jenny)
Cause its treating me fine too

She gets up and starts toward the stairs to the second floor Johnny
following her holding her hand As they pass Amsterdam he LEANS
toward

Jenny

AMSTERDAM
This is no game you and me Dont go on like its a game

JENNY
I said already its not a game Its business

Johnny pulls her away As he watches her go through the crowd
Amsterdams
gaze falls on Bill the Butcher again

and for the first tine their EYES MEET Bills eyes rest on
Amsterdam
take him all in but DONT REMEMBER him He looks away as a TAMMANY
HACK
steps up to pay court

and a MASTER OF REVELS center-floor SHOUTS

MASTER OF REVELS
Gentlemen and gentlewomen if you please we will now raise the
cages and start the bidding

The Crowd CHEERS and KIDS PULL on a series of ropes and pulleys to
RAISE

the CAGES further above the floor until they are parallel with the
second-floor gallery of the Pagoda WOMEN AND MEN call out BIDS even
as

the cages rise through the air Depending on their age the Women and
children inside the cages respond to the auction with grim
resignation

trepidation or fear A few drugged or drunk on all-sorts lie
insensible

in their impossibly cramped space

Johnny and Jenny make their way along the second floor gallery until
she

spots a COUPLE LEAVING a room and walks inside Johnny CLOSES the door
behind them as a BURST of APPLAUSE

rises from the main floor where Bill the Butcher stands in the
dead
center of the room He slowly removes his coat and hands it to a
FLUNRY
He is wearing his battle vest underneath and it is fully rigged with
all
his butchers implements

he place QUIETS KIDS swarm silently like busy ants all over a huge
ooden CHANDELIER LIGHTING its HUNDREDS of CANDLES Only the noise
rom

he Chinese playing fan-tan in the far corner of the room can be heard
ow

Same

he Kids finish lighting the candles and the chandelier is RAISED
oward

he Pagoda ceiling casting the whole place into a new riot of LIGHT
nd

HADOW as The Butcher prepares himself

noecttH

Now the Chinese Opera DANCER steps forward and stands near Bill He
NODS
The unsprung MUSIC begins The DANCER starts to move sinuously

and Bill with amazing skill starts THROWING his KNIVES The knife
MISSES the Dancer by a hairsbreadth landing in the floor near her

foot
She doesnt flinch She keeps dancing And Bill keeps THROWING

the KNIVES which follow the Dancer around the room in a careful
deadly choreography They land just inches from where she has just
been
or will be in a wall a pillar the apron of the small stage the
bar
the barrel of all-sorts After each knife LANDS kids retrieve it
When
one of the KNIFE KIDS pulls the blade from the all-sorts barrel
DRUNKS

knock each other over to drink from the stream that flows from the
hole

Native Americans meanwhile WORK THROUGH the awed attentive Crowd
They

AVOID Cops Tammany Members and anyone who looks too prosperous or too
sober But when one of the Natives SPOTS a MARGINAL CITIZEN they GRAB
his

hand and examine it as if they were telling fortunes

Center floor Bill pulls TWO KNIVES out BALANCES one in each hand

as a WHORE in the crowd pushes a guy whos groping her toward a
couple
of Natives Hels wearing a large RING As soon as the Natives SEE the
ring
they throw their arms around the GROPER like a long-lost pal and
escort
him to Bill

who THROWS both knives rapidly at the Dancer They land on the
floor
inches from her dancing feet She SPINS AWAY to great applause as the
Natives bring the Groper to Bill

BILL THE BUTCHER
Evening sir Are you prepared to be celebrated Are you ready to be
famous

GROPER
How much will it cost

BILL THE BUTCHER
Just a moment of your time My men will assist you

They do quite a bit more than that they GRAB the Groper and KNOCK him
to
the floor In the crowd one SPECTATOR turns to his companion

PAGODA SPECTATOR
Watch this careful Ive never seen the like not even in Barnums
Museum

The Groper CRIES OUT as the Natives PIN HIM to the floor
SPREADEAGLED

Bill has one weapon left in a special pocket inside his vest Its
his

CLEAVER He takes it out slowly SAVORING the moment

The Pagoda goes QUIET Only the gambling continues The MUSIC dies
The

only SOUND beside the noises of the Chinese at their fan-tan is the
Groper who HOLLERS for help as soon as he sees the cleaver
Bill HEFTS the cleaver in his hand feels its weight calculates
timing

figures distance and starts THROWING it in the air
CATCHING it by the handle then throwing it again higher
FASTER

and HARDER with every toss

BILL THE BUTCHER
(in full control)
Whats it so quiet for I dont need quiet

The Chinese opera MUSIC commences with a dissonant CRASH

and Bill catches the cleaver again But EVERY TIME he throws it
and
every time he catches it by its handle

he also MOVES CLOSER to the terrified Groper Now standing
very close he gives the cleaver a mighty toss

sending it SPINNING high in the air up past the cages past
the
second-floor gallery jammed with appreciative spectators until it
SLOWS seems to HANG in the air then starts its descent

FALLING FASTER towards Bills waiting STEADY HAND

The Groper SCREAMS in fear Bill SMILES confidently holding his hand
out
until just as smoothly just as confidently

he PULLS his hand AWAY and the cleaver FALLS with terrific impact
on
the SPLAYED HAND of the Groper cleanly SEVERING it at the wrist The
Groper FAINTS dead away as a TREMENDOUS CHEER greets Bills amazing
feat
One of the Natives TOSSES Bill the severed hand

Bill SLIDES the ring off the finger and TOSSES it to the Chinese
Dancer

BILL THE BUTCHER
Theres for your beauty and your song

The Dancer puts the ring on her finger and DANCES OFF Bill TOSSES the
hand to the floor and walks back to his table The Crowd PARTS
murmuring

compliments on his dexterity and the Knife Kids reverently RETURN the
Butchers implements
Now two DOGS from the rat pit in the back room RUN through the crowd
and
FIGHT FRENZIEDLY over possession of the bloody hand

The Crowd PASSES the Groper overhead and WE SEE from ABOVE the
Gropers

unconscicus BODY being passed from hand to hand The Crowd looks like
a

wave bearing the body toward the door The Gropers stump BLEEDS on
them

as he passes overhead sprinkling drops of blood and flesh like a
moveable

sacrament

Bill approaches his table acknowledging the continuing adulation and
is
about to sit down when a VOICE rises above all others

AMSTERDAM
Mr Poole

Bill turns searching out the voice

AMSTERDAM
Bill Poole

And SEES Amsterdam standing at his own table His attitude is calm
smiling respectful But his eyes are demonic

AMSTERDAM
My compliments on your exhibition sir

BILL THE BUTCHER
Thank you sir

AMSTERDAM

It was like watching a dance

(Bill nods his thanks)

Some great grand goddamned dance (Bill looks at him more closely)
You know me sir

BILL THE BUTCHER
Do I Are you missing a finger

Appreciative laughter from the crowd

AMSTERDAM
No A father

The laughter turns a little uneasy Bill the Butcher sizes up the
younger
man
BILL THE BUTCHER
Do you have a name

AMSTERDAM
Amsterdam

BILL THE BUTCHER
Thats a New York name
(suddenly smiles)

shall we drink to it

AMSTERDAM

Indeed

(they drink)

And to my other name Vallon Will you drink to that

BILL THE BUTCHER

Priest Vallons son

(Amsterdam nods)

Of course Ill drink to that Your father was a worthy man

AMSTERDAM

Not worthy of you Those dogs aint worthy of you You aint worth
what
they feed on and what they shits too good for you

DEAD QUIET Absolute Breathless Only the Chinese Gamblers at their
fan-tan ignore this confrontation

BILL THE BUTCHER
What do you want boyo

AMSTERDAM
I got to give you something Butcher Something from my father

Amsterdam PULLS OUT the piratels knife which Bill the Butcher used to
kill
his father almost 12 years before

BILL THE BUTCHER

You got the sand to draw a blade in front of me You will make good
sport

Come ahead and give it here you son of a bitch

And Amsterdam THROWS the knife the bright blade FLASHING OUT of his
hand
like lightning

And just as quickly the Buitcher PICKS UP his table sending glasses
flying and breaking using it as a SHIELD
and the knife THUMPS into it dead center The Butcher HEAVES the
table
at Amsterdamsending PATRONS yelling and SCATTERING

Amsterdam LEAPS out of the way of the table then RUNS AT Bill the
Butcher

whos already coming for him As they CLASH and GRAPPLE with each
other

PATRONS all over the Pagoda crowd around for a good view of the
action
and start to MAKE BETS on the outcome The odds do not favor
Amsterdam

And neither does the fight Amsterdam fights with real blood lust but
he
doesnt have the Butchers skill or experience or dispassion He
breaks
the Butchers CLINCH HITS him once in the face then a second
time

and then gets FLOORED by a well placed kick The Crowd cheers

And on the second floor Jenny and Johnny come out of the room Still
arranging her clothes Jenny looks over the gallery rail onto the
floor

below sees the fight and starts to RUN down the stairs Johnny
WATCHES

her go looks at the fight again for a second then follows
Jenny to

the main floor

The Butcher is on top of Amsterdam now He HITS him upside the head
with

the wood and brass handle of his cleaver Then hits him again AND
AGAIN

In the Crowd now Jenny finds Sheeny Mike

JENNY
The Butcherll kill him if we dont do something

SHEENY MIKE

It was Amsterdams own doing And itll be our death too if we try to
stop

it

JOHNNY
(finally catching up)
Thats the truth
JENNY
The truth is you dont give a damn about him

SHEENY MIKE
Yeah well if he gave a damn about us he wouldnt have called out the
Butcher in the first place

Jenny looks at him with contempt then STARTS into the crowd Johnny
grabs
her ARM but she pushes him off

On the floor Bill uses the FLAT SIDE of the cleaver to SMACK the

barely

conscious Amsterdam on one side of his face then on the other
REPEATEDLY until Amsterdam is barely sensible Bill grabs him by
the

hair Amsterdams body is slack

BILL THE BUTCHER
What do you say Loin or shank Rib or chop

The Crowd YELLS their choices Jenny tries to PLUNGE through toward
Amsterdam but a HALF-DOZEN MORTS and WHORES put hands on her and HOLD
her

back

BILL THE BUTCHER

Come on let me hear you

(the Crowd yells louder)

Youre all talking at once I cant hear you

(a near frenzy)

I dont hear the choicest cut The best the vital
(they quiet a little to listen)
The heart I think I must have the heart

This is greeted with the biggest CHEER of the night The newlyelected
Mayor Wood seems to feel as if he should do something to stop the

slaughter but Boss Tweed calms him with a single dismissive GESTURE
Even
the Boss himself is excited by the prospect of this ritual sacrifice

BILL THE BUTCHER

Come on look at it You fancy yourself a gladiator act a gladiator
(raises his cleaver)

Watch the death blow when it comes to you Go to hell with open eyes

Bill the Butcher readies himself to deliver the blow and a HAND
GRABS

his wrist STOPPING his arm
Who would dare do this to Bill the Butcher Bill turns incredulous
to
look into

the untroubled face of Monk Eastman

MONK EASTMAN
Its been a full evenings fun now Butcher Its enough

BILL THE BUTCHER
You got nothing to do with this Monk

MONK EASTMKN

Well Im the game warden you might say Im telling you this bucks
too

young yet Wait till hes aged for a proper kill

BILL THE BUTCHER
The hell

With his gigantic strength Monk actually PULLS the Butcher off
Amsterdam

and onto his feet

MONK EASTMKN
Just settle yourself Bill

and he part SHOVES part THROWS Bill back a good twenty feet

MONK EASTMKN
and let the merrymaking continue

The Dead Rabbits have scampered forward and theyre picking Amsterdam

up

off the floor Monk looks at Jenny and Johnny who each have Amsterdam
by

an arm

MONK EASTMAN
It was his father took me in first and its thanks Im returning now

BILL THE BUTCHER
Eastman

MONK EASTMAN
(ignoring Bill)
This squares any debt Get him out of here

BILL THE BUTCHER
Monk Eastman

As the Rabbits CARRY Amsterdam toward the door Monk finally turns his
attention back to Bill

BILL THE BUTCHER
Ill have you then

MONK EASTMAN
Come ahead Bill Unless youre wanting to shout me to death

And Bill comes forward BRANDISHING his cleaver Monk Eastman stands
his
ground unmoving untroubled Everyone looks on in awe at this contest

except Boss Tweed

BOSS TWEED

(to Killoran)

f these two are going to combat it aught to be a worthier occasion
And

more rewarding for all

Tweed SIGNALS to Bill STOP The Butcher sees the signal but cant
believe

it He SHAKES his head His blood is up He wont stop

Tweed SIGNALS AGAIN Bill KEEPS COMING

Tweed signals Killoran who STANDS himself And when he stands every
COP
and TAMMANY LOYALIST in the place--a hundred of them anyway--STAND
behind

Boss Tweed

As Bill keeps coming and Monk stands easy waiting

the Natives and their ALLIES now stand facing the Tammany crew
The
Tammany backers dressed flush and fancy face the scruffier more
savage
Five Points bunch the twin factions of the criminal underworld so
different in style and so similar in purpose SIZE EACH OTHER UP from
opposite sides of the room

Bill STOPS The odds are shifting the stakes are climbing Even the
Chinese STOP GAMBLING For the first time all evening the room is
absolutely STILL Even the Dead Rabbits have turned at the door to
see

what will happen

Tweed and the Butcher LOCK EYES neither blinks Then after a moment
a
very long moment a calm bemused Tweed RAISES his glass
BOSS TWEED

I only wanted to thank you Bill for the customary good job today
and

an equally bright future for us both

Another pause Bill does not look placated The whole place seems
ready to
explode

until Boss Tweed RISES to his feet and RAISES his glass higher

BOSS TWEED
Will you drink with me Bill as a friend An honored friend

Bill weighs the proposition then looks to his men NODS his head to
call them off He GRABS a glass off a table to join Tweeds toast

The MUSIC begins again The gambling recommences Patrons take their
seats The Dead Rabbits help Amsterdam out the door

Monk Eastman sidles up to Bill the Butcher

MONK EASTMAN
If theres one thing I cant abide its fighting for free

He takes the Butchers glass from his hand raises it in salute
DRINKS
DEEP and hands it back to him

At the door of the Pagoda a badly beaten Ansterdam starts FLAILING
and
fighting by brute instinct He HITS Jenny and she goes down Johnny
grapples with him as Jenny PICKS HERSELF up and struggles to help
SUBDUE

Amsterdam

JENNY
Go easy Go easy Its over

JOHNNY
He knew what he was doing hitting you

JENNY
Lets get him up

She grabs Amsterdams arm and with Johnnys help tries to HOIST him
back
to his feet

JENNY
(Looking at Amsterdams bloody face)
Therels too damn little of him left to know anything
They start across Paradise Square holding him up

as the rest of the Dead Rabbits join to help them all growing
smaller in the distance against the primeval nighttime landscape of
the
Five Points

and the Bouncer CLOSES the door
DISSOLVE TO
66 INT DON WHISKERANDOS BARBER SHOP DAY

Another DOOR OPENS and Amsterdam stands on the threshold A week or
so

has passed since the big night at Sparrows Pagoda but Amsterdams
face

still shows the marks of Bills beating

Don Whiskerandos is ministering to Monk Eastman with a straight razor
giving him a close and careful shave Monk is thoroughly relaxed
doesnt

even glance over when the door opens hardly reacts when Don
Whiskerandos

says

DON WHISKERANDOS
Someones here for you

MONK EASTMAN
That so Whats he look like

DON WHISKERANDOS
He looks pretty damned sorry

MONK EASTMAN
(looks at Amsterdam)
Indeed- Can I buy you a shave

AMSTERDAM
No thanks

MONK EASTMAN
Face is too sore eh I understand

AMSTERDAM
No Im beholden enough to you as it is I dont like to be beholden

MONK EASTMAN
Were all even son Theres nothing more between us
AMSTERDAM
Id like it if there was

MONK EASTMAN
Are you proposing employment

AMSTERDAM

A collaboration The Dead Rabbits got to get strong before we make
another

move I figure youre the one to make us strong Theres a lot we can
learn from you

MONK EASTMAN
Boyo Im a freebooter and a mercenary not a teacher I cant learn
nothing from you and I cant earn nothing from you either

AMSTERDAM

The Dead Rabbits is going to be glorious again Were going to reign
over

the Points

MONK EASTMAN
And Bill Pooles Natives What will they have to say

AMSTERDAM
Nothing They wont have tongues left to speak

MONK EASTMAN

Dont worry about what theylll have in their mouths You think about
what

they got in their hands

(beat)

Listen son take a word from a man who was honored to fight beside
your

father Temper yourself like a sword and pay attention to balance
Anger

spoils an edge

AMSTERDAM
Then you say no

Monk SIGHS and points to a huge WAR CLUB which hangs in a place of
honor

above the shop mirror It has deep marks running along its front like
NOTCHES-

MONK EASTMAN

You see my instrument there First notch represents two dollars and
fifty

cents Thats how much I got for my first kill There are forty-eight
more
notches after it and my fee has grown with each one I can
accommodate

you alright but you got to afford me So do business with me or do it
on

your own

AMSTERDAM
Everything I got is still to come So I guess its on my own then

MONK EASTMAN

Fair enough Youll find independence a fine thing a fierce thing
Although I do hold money preferable to all

(Amsterdam turns to leave)

But Im sure well have news of each other

AMSTERDAM
Bound to

As he shuts the door of the shop Monk Eastman gestures to Don
Whiskerandos for another hot towel

CcuT TO
67 EXT STREETS OFF PARADISE SQUARE DAY

A large wagon bearing a Tammany banner and carrying dozens of small
sacks

of coal moves slowly down the narrow street Boss Tweed sits on the
front

seat next to the driver as his minions HAND him coal sacks Tweed
distributes them with a smile to the NEEDY who trot next to the wagon

BOSS TWEED
(to the people as they grab the coal)

Tammanys here to take the chill off the winter and the weight off
your
heart Its Tammany can make this city a fit place with the help and
vote
of all you good people

As he continues Bill the Butcher JUMPS onto the wagon and sits down
beside him Boss Tweed hardly gives him a glance

BILL THE BUTCHER
You sent me word

BOSS TWEED
We could use help here Grab a sack

BILL THE BUTCHER
I keep my hands clean
BOSS TWEED
(now he looks at him)
So Ive observed

BILL THE BUTCHER

(tense)

Better be on your mark to talk like that to me It was you stopped me
at

the Pagoda I would have cut Monk inside out

BOSS TWEED

What if you hadnt Think of the embarrassment And what if you had
Consider the waste Next time youre in a dust-up like that think
ahead

and make proper plans Itd be a grand source of revenue whoever
prevails

BILL THE BUTCHER
It touches my heart how you always have our best interests in mind

BOSS TWEED

Our mutual interests Thats why I want you to contact Monk Eastman
(Bills incredulous)

I want you to extend a proposition I want him to join US

BILL THE BUTCHER

What

BOSS TWEED

Oh not Tammany of course not We could no more have him there than
you

But he should throw in with the Native Americans become aware of our
Arrangement and well use his influence shall we say to enrich
us

all

BILL THE BUTCHER

Youre saying I cant do everything you need You dont think the
Natives

has been doing good and right You think theres something more he can
do

that I

BOSS TWEED

(interrupting)

Its none of that Bill None of that His independence is like a
rebuke

to Tammany And an insult to you

BILL THE BUTCHER
Then you should have let me have him at Sparrows
BOSS TWEED

I should If Id been confident-absolutely certain--that you would
have

prevailed Monk is an unpredictable power and a figure of size He
needs

to be reckoned with

BILL THE BUTCHER
He needs to be killed

BOSS TWEED

No Hes an elemental force Them you dont destroy But you can
contain

them and use them for the good they give off

He hands Bill a sack of coal

BOSS TWEED
Coal

Bill doesnt answer He HOPS DOWN off the moving wagon and the Needy
give

way quickly before him then regroup and SWARM after Tweed and his
coal

The Boss continues with his Tammany spiel-enjoying all the attention--

the Butcher watches disdainful of Tweed but filled with angry
frustration From his face we

the incredulous face of Monk Eastman as he looks at Bill the
Butcher

MONK EASTMAN
And this is your offer

BILL THE BUTCHER
Its Boss Tweedls offer

MONK EASTMAN
How do you think wed sit as allies Bill

BILL THE BUTCHER

The only way we could tolerate being near each other would be
stretched

out dead

MONK EASTMAN
My thoughts exactly Then why are you here Because you were asked to
be

You were ordered to be And who would order me among the Natives You
And

would you follow my orders even if they was being relayed from
William

Marcy Tweed himself

He EASES himself out of the barber chair The Butcher TENSES as Monk
comes
toward him

MONK EASTMAN

Dubious and doubtful my friend But your offer--pardon the offer you
bring--is the most generous thats ever been extended I favor the
terms

if not the personalities So let us decide the way any Native American
would appreciate Well do it the democratic way

He throws open the door of the barber shop and stands there beside
Bill

the Butcher his arm thrown carelessly around him PASSERSBY stop in
wonderment as Monk ADDRESSES them

MONK EASTMAN

Citizens of the Five Points It seems the Native Americans have come
to

trouble They have grown so weak that now they seek my help They can
pay

any wage I ask But I ask you now Even for money should I carouse
and

conspire alongside a boyo like this with gristle on his knife and
spittle

on his chin every time his cock gets hard

Monk is beaming the Butcher is appalled His body tenses like a snake
ready to spring But the people in the street just STARE- They cant
believe what theyve just heard

MONK EASTMAN
(to Bill)
There You see Im afraid the people have spoken

BILL THE BUTCHER
Ill see you again you bog Irish bastard

MONK EASTMAN
Well if its a fight you want now Bill remember to come back with a
bankroll

Monk returns to the shop and the comfort of his chair Bill GLARES at
the
people in the street One lock from him starts them moving fast But
they

do not look away from him quite so fast or at him either with quite
the

same fear

JENNY
Everdeane Jenny Everdeane

REVEREND RALEIGH
Miss Everdeane Step forward please

Radiant and curious Jenny joins the Reverend Raleigh in the center of
the
room

REVEREND RALEIGH
And the evenings regent chooses her evenings partner

There is much MUTTERING about this from everyone Someone makes a wet
farting SOUND

REVERAND RALEIGH
(unfazed)
Here we make only joyful noises to the Lord

Under the instruction of the bustling Reverend and his HELPERS the
Women

skeptically stand away from the Men who allow themselves to be
arranged

into a LINE The Reverend Raleigh escorts the delighted Jenny to a
chair

that has been placed by itself in the center of the room Jenny sits
down facing away from the rest of the guests She holds a MIRROR in
her

hand

REVEREND RALEIGH
Now The men please One by one

The first volunteer Reverend Raleigh brings forward is a reluctant
Sheeny

Mike There are RUDE COMMENTS as he leads Mike slowly to the center of
the
room coming up behind Jenny until she can see Mikels face reflected
in
the mirror She SHAKES her head

REVEREND RALEIGH
Next Gentleman please

More laughing The BOYS push out one CANDIDATE Rejected

Now ANOTHER CANDIDATE comes forward And STILL ANOTHER- Jenny rejects
each
with the composure of a princess

Now it is Johnnys turn He WALKS slowly across the big room and
stands

behind Jenny trying to look confident The moment is long the rooms
tense until--just once but very decisively-Jenny SHAKES her head

Jenny watches Johnnys face in the mirror She stays still Finally
he
walks back to the GANG

Now Amsterdam starts toward the center of the room He keeps his eyes
fixed on Jenny

Jenny catches Amsterdams reflection in the mirror He STOPS She NODS
her
head Yes Him

A small BAND strikes up a barely recognizable version of A Mighty
Fortress Is Our God arranged in waltz time Jenny rises and holds
out

her arms to Amsterdam They start to DANCE a little clumsily as
other

COUPLES join them

AMSTERDAM
So you accept

JENNY
What

AMSTERDAM
You accept to be my mort and no one elses

JENNY

(teasing)

No its just that I didnt recognize you in the mirror You still got
some of the face the Butcher gave you

AMSTERDAM
(going along with the joke)
Its not the Butcher its the dancing It shifts my face all around

JENNY
Maybe youll look better later

The Reverend Raleigh and his Helpers DASH among the dancers
distributing

LIGHTED CANDLES which the COUPLES take and hold as they move around
the

floor

AMSTERDAM

I will if were together later

(she smiles)

And what about after that After tonight

JENNY
I chose you just for tonight If thats not good enough Ill go with
someone else

She takes a candle from the Reverend and holds it so the light
FLICKERS on
Amsterdams face

AMSTERDAM
Ill have tonight But after this dont come to me no more till youre
ready No more

His eyes in the candlelight show both his love and his Resolution
Jenny
NODS and they DANCE AWAY

losing themselves now among the dancers all moving and holding
candles As they dance their movement becomes SPLIT SEQUENTIAL a
study
in motion like an old Gjon Mili photograph Their bodies create a RUSH

OF
YELLOW LIGHT ACROSS the screen like the tail of a comet

70 INT- DEAD RABBITS HOUSE NIGHT

In the hallway JOHNNY stands pressed against a door
JOHNNY

(whispering)

Amsterdam

(louder hissing)

Amsterdam

AMSTERDAM (VO)
Who is it

JOHNNY
Me

AMSTERDAM
Come on in

JOHNNY
I dont want to come in You come out

AMSTERDAM
Just a damn minute

AMSTERDAM comes to the door half-dressed and sleepy We see Jenny
asleep
on the floor inside

AMSTERDAM
What do you want

CcuT TO
71 EXT PIERDEAD RABBITS HOUSE NIGHT

Just before dawn The streets are empty the river is quiet AMSTERDAM
follows JOHNNY out of the house

JOHNNY
Im going to fight you

AMSTERDAM
Oh Jesus Johnny Im tired How about sometime else

JOHNNY
Now

AMSTERDAM

You want to tell me what this fights over Is it The Butcher Jenny
(Johnny turns determined)

Alright alright Then tell me why like this

JOHNNY
So when I lose no one will see

And he SLUGS him Hard Harder even than he thought he could
AMSTERDAM

stumbles stunned then pulls himself up And CHARGES at Johnny
knocking

him down

The two friends PUNCH WRESTLE BITE and PUMMEL EACH OTHER with such
extravagant energy that they soon
ROLL OFF the pier

CUT TO

72 EXT PIER DAWN

onto the muddy ground underneath the pier They LAND with a
shuddering
SPLASH in the soggy earth but they keep fighting

as a PACK OF ORPHANS eyes glinting like night animals scatter
like
wild beasts disturbed in their burrow

Amsterdam has the physical advantage and more skill But Johnny has
the

fury All the feeling and the frustration rain out of him physically
making the match nearly even

The Orphan Pack watches the fight silently showing no favoritism or
emotion just an edge of curiosity

Amsterdam HITS Johnny a wicked combination that makes him SINK to one
knee

in the mud But Johnny will not go down Amsterdam hurt himself just
stares at Johnny in wonderment

AMSTERDAM
Satisfied

JOHNNY
Satisfied It wasnt me thats been dancing and shagging all night

And he pulls himself to his feet and THROWS a roundhouse at Amsterdam
who

half-staggers out of the way The moment throws Johnny off balance
and he

falls in the mud again this time on all fours Amsterdam SINKS down
beside him

AMSTERDAM
Enough

Johnny wont stop he throws a punch that Amsterdam can see coming a
block

away But hes too tired too duck or maybe hes just fed up He takes
the

punch and FALLS on his back

AMSTERDAM
Thats it then

JOHNNY
The hell

And he THROWS HIMSELF on Amsterdam Its more like he rolls over onto
him

than anything but hes on top of him now hitting him in the face
with

all hes got left in him

AMSTERDAM
Goddamn it

Amsterdam HEAVES Johnny off and pops him a solid SWIPE to the jaw
That

does it Lights out Johnny falls unconscious into the slime beneath
the

pier

The Orphan Pack keeps staring from the shadow with their ferret eyes
Still silent Amsterdam STRUGGLES to his feet stops at the rivers
edge

to get a handful of water to revive himself Then he looks over sees
his

unconscious friend

AMSTERDAM
Goddamn you anyway

He grabs Johnnys body by the shoulders and pulls him to the rivers
edge

He gets some water on his hand lets it drip over Johnnys face
washing

away a little of the blood Not enough He draws some more water and
RUBS

it gently onto Johnnys face

CLOSE on the motion of his hand It is nearly gentle

73 INT DON WHISKERANDOS BARBER SHOP DAY

As Don Whiskerandos hand holding a razor travels over the great
plains

of Monk Eastmans face His hand is shaking

MONK EASTMAN
Whats the trouble Don

DON WHISKERANDOS
Theres someone here

Monk bestirs himself in the chair SEES Bill the Butcher standing in
the
doorway

MONK EASTMAN
Its just a man of commerce

Monk settles back in the chair as Bill the Butcher walks into the
shop

BILL THE BUTCHER

Youre right enough this time Monk

(to Don Whiskerandos)

Go ahead

(the barber hesitates)

Go on with your work Ill finish my business

Don Whiskerandos picks up a pair of SCISSORS and NERVOUSLY starts to
TRIM
Monks hair

MONK EASTMAN
Come out with it then

Bill NODS emphatically at Don Whiskerandos who is clearly terrified
Bill

nods again almost vehemently Don Whiskerandos SHAKES his head Bill
GLARES at him The Barber takes a STEP BACK Monk opens his eyes
starts

to size up the situation

BILL THE BUTCHER
You damn craven do it

Bill LEAPS forward grabs the trembling barbers arm and pushes it
toward
MONK

MONK EASTMAN
(rising from his chair)
What the hell

and the scissors held by Don Whiskerandos and pushed by Bill the
Butcher meet Monk full in the face as he bolts from the chair The
long

scissor BLADE SINKS into Monkls right eye

MONK BELLOWS staggers toward Don Whiskerandos who shrinks against
the
wall The scissor protrudes from Monks eye as he RAGES blinded by
blood
now reaching out for the Butcher

BILL THE BUTCHER
Your eyes was open for that alright And you still got one to see
this

Bill the Butcher reaches above him for Monks war club which hangs on
the
wall He grabs tight hold of it and with Monk nearly upon him swings
it
viciously at Monks head The BLOW sends the scissor FLYING out of
Monks

eye with the eyeball still attached It also SMASHES in the side of
Monks face He FALLS still GRABBING desperately for the Butcher

who now stands over him beating him incessantly with the war

club
CAVING his head in KILLING him

Don Whiskerandos looks at Bill in a virtual paralysis of terror The
Butcher lets the CLUB FALL reaches in his pocket and throws some

MONEY at
the barber

BILL THE BUTCHER
If I was you Id use that to open in a new location Consider St
Louis

The enormity of what hes done is beginning to sink in He turns to
leave
the shop but STOPS in the doorway

Outside CITIZENS of the Points are staring at the fallen Monk in mute
wonder They have just witnessed a moment in history

Bill the Butcher surveys them all silently then calls out to Don
Whiskerandos

BILL THE BUTCHER
The war club

The barber steels himself to CARRY the bloody club to the Butcher who
hefts it slowly in his hands in view of all

He takes a knife from his vest and CUTS the LAST NOTCH in the club
Then
slowly

he steps down into the crowd which PARTS before him He
walks among them in regal splendor the war club at his side dripping
gore

As the crowd falls back Bill spots Amsterdam Johnny and some of the
other Dead Rabbits watching his every mave He STOPS

HOLDS OUT the bloody war club in front of him straight in front of
him POINTING IT right at Amsterdam

BILL THE BUTCHER
I promise you Amsterdam I promise you

Then he grins turns away and walks through the crowd prince of all
he
surveys

CcuT TO
74 INT RESTAURANTPARK ROW

Boss Tweed reigns in the banquet room of a vast gaslit restaurant at
a

long table overburdened with food Seated along both sides of the
table is

an array of the citys POWER BROKERS with whom Tweed and his Tammany
MINIONS mix easily Their attitude toward the Power Brokers is a
mixture

of ribald fawning and fine condescension the Power Brokers in turn
enjoy the food and the MUSIC from a small BAND and the DANCING GIRLS
who

flirt and entertain them while exuding the unmistakable impression of
amateur anthropologists exploring a decaying civilization

Tweed is courting and joking with a bewhiskered HORACE GREELEY editor
of
the influential Tribune

GREELEY

I may enjoy the bounty of your table and the pleasures of your
company

Mr Tweed

BOSS TWEED
And the pleasures of the company provided you Mr Greeley

GREELEY
without the Tribune endorsing your politics

BOSS TWEED
I suppose you can at that Take with one hand flay with the other
Virtuels on your conscience Horace but Tammanys in your heart
Killoran materializes at Tweeds side and whispers something quickly
discreetly in his ear Tweed EXCUSES himself rises quickly and WALKS
across the restaurant floor

past the Band and the Dancing Giris

to the swinging doors of the kitchen As he pushes open the
SWINGING
DOOR his face has lost its humor

CcuT TO
75 INT KITCHENRESTAURANTPARK ROW

A madhouse of activity WAITERS in black suits vests and serving
outfits

STREAM by carrying huge TRAYS of food while the KITCHEN STAFF works
double-time to keep up with the unceasing volume

As Boss Tweed walks in Bill the Butcher PLUCKS a piece of roasted
poultry
off a tray as its carried out the door

BILL THE BUTCHER

m not good enough for your table so I eat where I can (takes a big
bite)

ts good what is it

BOSS TWEED
Pheasant

BILL THE BUTCHER

s that like pigeon I killed a pigeon once but it didnt taste
nothing

like this

BOSS TWEED
You killed a bull this morning I told you to make an Arrangement with
him and you come back with his blood on your hands

BILL THE BUTCHER

(chewing his food)

He insulted me He aggravated me I couldnt stand for that for no
one

BOSS TWEED
You stand for anything if I tell you

BILL THE BUTCHER
You think I should be afraid of you You act like lightning strikes
when
you talk

As they talk and the tension builds between them the two men are
constantly BUFFETED by the swinging doors and the unending stream of
WAITERS

BILL THE BUTCHER
I never was afraid of you so dont think I was or act like I was you
aint earned it

BOSS TWEED
What did you earn us killing Monk

BILL THE BUTCHER

Whered you earn the right to ask that question You raised some dust
in

the streets a while back but no more You got power but you aint got
muscle and you aint got a notion what it means to be a warrior

BOSS TWEED
I see it lost you a lot of Gods sense along with that eye

BILL THE BUTCHER

You dont know nothing about that It was my doing It says in The
Book

If thy eye offend thee pluck it out I followed that law with my
own

knife and hand The first I ever fought Priest Vallon he bested me
And

when he came to bring me to death I looked away and he watched me and
he

let me go The shame was worse than the killing I would have cut out
both

eyes if I could still have fought but cutting just the one gave me
heart

When I killed Priest Vallon that restored me Now I sent Monk Eastman
over I got glory I got all there is and small thanks to you squire

BOSS TWEED

(measured conciliatory) You need two eyes to see the depth Bill
Thats

how we help each other If it wasnt for me would be happy enough to
plunder the Points and put the fear into people who dont know nothing
else But Bill Im only saying Im counselinm look in the
distance

You want to sit at my table fine But you must always remember who
the

host is Its not a matter of courage welre talking Its manners

Bill grabs another piece of food from a tray

BILL THE BUTCHER
Howls these manners

BOSS TWEED
Fine if youre hungry

BILL THE BUTCHER
Im always hungry

BOSS TWEED
Ive always told you Bill Theres plenty for all and more for us
together than separate Well dine together sometime

Bill the Butcher nods appeased and leaves swaggering his way
through

the kitchen chaos making everyone get out of his way Boss Tweed
watches

him go his expression changing from bemused appeasement to molten
rage

CcuT TO
76 INT RESTAURANTPARK ROW

Later Everyones gone except some WAITERS cleaning up and Boss
Tweed

and Daniel Killoran who sit at the end of the banquet table Leftover
plates of food have been massed at Tweedls place and as he talks he
PICKS from them

BOSS TWEED

Let me put this to you Daniel Now that the Butcher has killed the
single

most prominent figure in the Five Points--a man of myth and moment--
who is

there to take his place

(as Killoran starts to answer)

Of course Then what do we do about the Butcher Hes too useful to be
killed but he must be checked

KILLARAN
It could be a police matter

BOSS TWEED

Impossible Any cops who might have the mettle to go against the
Butcher

have blood ties to the gangs They cant be trusted And any cops that
can

be trusted are too craven to be any use If Bills to be checked it
must

come from within the Points not without

KILLORAN
The Dead Rabbits did a proud job for elections That Amsterdam boy has
sand

BOSS TWEED

That so The last time I saw him he was under the Butchers knife
looking

like a fine filet Who else is there

KILLORAN

Well the Rough and Tumble Boys over to Slaughterhouse Point Theres
Country McCleesterls bunch too and the Plug Uglies but theres none
that have the promise of the Dead Rabbits or the stake neither

BOSS TWEED
What would that be

KILLORAN

The boy Amsterdam has a blood feud with the Butcher Hes sworn
revenge

for the death of his father and hes got the heart to carry it
forward

Hell have the skill and power soon enough

BOSS TWEED
Blood will make a man intrepid Bring them along then Nurture the
Rabbits with neglect Let them roam where they like

KILLORAN
And if they roam into some portion of our own revenues

BOSS TWEED

Id tolerate a little trespassing if it was for a higher good and use
Theyll cross with the Natives soon enough and keep each other
occupied

KILLORAN
Bills got to be a lot more than occupied

BOSS TWEED

Ill hold Bill in check If he becomes unwieldy well damn it all
Daniel I might just have to oil up my old musket What do you think
of

that eh

Boss Tweed gets up from the table A WAITER is DIMMING the gaslights
filling the room with deep shadows

KILLORAN
Itd be gratifying Mr Tweed Even edifying

BOSS TWEED
But poor politics eh Well we musnt have that
(as he walks away)

I do miss those roistering days though Oh and bring some of that
food

for the canaries

77 EXT STREETTHE BLOODY ANGLE DAY

The sharply-angled turn of Doyers Street nicknamed The Bloody

YOUNG CHILDREN

A NATIVE AMERICAN drives a cart carrying large barrels of MILK A
SECOND

NATIVE rides beside him on the seat holding a rifle looking
impassively

78 INT MOTHER JOYCES BORDELLO DAY

The midday sun shining through the windows makes the place look tatty
and

slightly desperate this is a place that needs low light and long
shadows

to look good

Amsterdam and Johnny are at a long bar talking to Mother Joyce a
beefy
wised-up woman with pornographic tattoos an both forearms

MOTHER JOYCE
This place is so clean its the next thing to chaste And safe as a
convent too

AMSTERDAM
From the Natives maybe But not from us

MOTHER JOYCE
Youre saying I got to worry about your mob too

JOHNNY
No worries at all You throw in with the Dead Rabbits and well worry
about the Natives

Across the room Jenny is sitting talking to a few of the WHORES one
of

whom is a mixed-blood Eurasian with long black hair named Emma Loss
She

gets up lazily and heads for the bar As she passes a DRUNK he
reaches

out to grab her Shes used to this and she knocks his hand away He
keeps after her

At the bar Mother Joyce notices Emma being hassled but pays no
attention her girls can take care of themselves

MOTHER JOYCE
(to Amsterdam and Johnny)
And if someone else comes along do I pay them too

AMSTERDAM

Johnny has been watching the drunk bothering Emma Loss Without saying

JOHNNY
Leave off her She dont want you Not even if you could pay her

EMMA LOSS

MOTHER JOYCE

(laughs)

A bouncer I dont know if he could bounce on a feather bed He wants
to

be a character like you is that it

AMSTERDAM
Hes got his own ideas Too full of Tammany maybe but hes a fast

Across the room Johnny is talking to Emma Loss She NODS and starts

Amsterdam dressed in a suit cant quite conceal his wonder as he
stands

staring at the house

AMSTERDAM

AMSTERDAM
Youre off your head

JENNY

(pleased showing off)

You can wait on me a minute Or Ill see you back in the Points if
youre

scared

(Amsterdam looks at her)

Dont worry I know every house on this street They all leave their
doors

open They live like theyre not in New York

She GOES IN the house Amsterdam WATCHES through the window sees her
going up stairs Then he looks at the dining room visible distantly
through an open kitchen door

He WATCHES fascinated fragments of the everyday rituals of a world
hes
never seen As SOUNDS drift listlessly from the street beyond and a
light
BREEZE blows WE SEE IN A SERIES OF DISSOLVES the serving of a meal
SERVANTS carrying and passing plates FAMILY MEMBERS reaching for
dishes

and passing them the LOW KURMUR of Konversation in accents he has
never

heard Its not so much that these people and their life are foreign
to

him It is as if he has stepped into another Dimension

He loses his sense of time and of danger So that when Jenny TOUCHES
his
arm she surprises him thoroughly

JENNY
Come on I might still be taken for a maid But youre nobodys notion
of
a butler

84 EXT UPTOWN STREET DAY

As Jenny and Amsterdam walk away from the house She holds his arm
They

look young and full of hope like a servant couple just over from the
old

country enjoying a day off

JENNY

The Police Commissioner lives the next street over I was thinking of
visiting him next month but cops dont buy goods They keep all their
graft in cash

Amsterdam looks at the houses with wonder that he tries to make
casual

She opens her satchel a little way then NUDGES him to have a lock at
the

swag inside

JENNY
Hows that for ten minutes

AMSTERDAM
Its a lot to fence

JENNY

Im not going to fence it Im going to keep it and take it where no
one

will recognize it

AMSTERDAM
Where would that be

JENNY

Somewhere west Far west Past the Mississippi River somewhere into
that

territory

AMSTERDAM
Thats a hard journey for a woman alone

JENNY
Youd be with me

AMSTERDAM
You got it all planned and straight is that it

JENNY
Once I said Id be with you I wanted someplace we could be together
Someplace better than here Whats the matter with that

Lets go and greet some Natives

Under SCATTERED RIFLE FIRE and a barrage of ROCKS the GANG STORMS the
building charging inside and starting up the ladder as if they were
attacking a medieval fortress ARMS reach out from windows to try and
pull

them off The Rabbits respond with knives and PISTOL SHOTS As they
charge

breathless to the ground Amsterdam SPINS again and swings the butt
into

Gent 2s face knocking him cold

AMSTERDAM

I know this building

CcuT TO
87 INT UNDERGROUNDJACOBS LADDER

As Jenny leads Amsterdam through a narrow tunnel The place is like a
weird catacomb it is narrow and dank filled with bones of dead
animals

of the two- and four-legged variety
JENNY

These lead all under the Square into the Brewery and out again from
there Theyre closed off and forgotten since the Reverend opened the
mission Pass me the candle

Amsterdam hands Jenny a stump of candle which she holds high enough
to
see

that the tunnel has opened onto a small room just above the
foundation
of Jacobs Ladder Its a graveyard memorializing gang members gone
toa
better world--or worse Trophies from many gangs--including the bones
and
skulls of some Dead Rabbits-litter the place in loose ritual fashion
as
if this were a catacomb in Palermo

Stooping low Jenny walks to a narrow corner of the room where
several

PAVING STONES have been laid in the rough pattern of a cross A slab
of

slate serves as a headstone and on it in fading paint barely
legible

is the name Maggie Everdeane

JENNY

We lived in this building till she lost her seamstress work and we
went to

the Brewery One day she slept so drunk she never woke and I brought
her

back here Dug this myself

(beat)

Families Give here what I gave you

Amsterdam hands her a chest that looks like a small version of
Blackbeards treasure box She opens it and holds the candle close
inside

is the swag from all her cat burglaries Theres a lot of it
GLITTERING

with promise in the GUTTERING flame Jenny starts to dig in her
mothers

grave

JENNY
Shell keep an eye on this for us How about some help

He KNEELS beside her and they dig at the grave with stones and bones

AMSTERDAM
You trusting me with your treasure then
JENNY
Just take another look at it to remind you I can always do fine on my
own

Amsterdam reaches inside the chest pulls out a ring and SLIPS it onto
Jennys dirt-covered finger She KISSES him

JENNY
Whats mine is yours is that it

AMSTERDAM
I could use this too

From the bag he holds up a small GOLD CROSS

JENNY
You making an offering to the Reverend Raleigh

Amsterdam slips the cross into his pocket without answering and starts
to
dig again

AMSTERDAM
Are you sure we can trust your mother

BOSS TWEED
The Dead Rabbits are a wooly bunch alright

BILL THE BUTCHER

BOSS TWEED

Not just now Its between too late and too soon Theyve become a
little

too prominent for comfort but theyre still too small for you to soil
your hands The man who killed Monk Eastman pushing around a mob of
upstarts Its practically undignified

BILL THE BUTCHER
To hell with any of that

Tweed stops under a grand new PORTRAIT of himself

BOSS TWEED

Very well and to hell as well with any plans you and I may have for
growth and change and even greater reward Youll never advance
anywhere

beyond the limited perimeter of your imagination

BILL THE BUTCHER

small

hole at a grave site then covers it over with dirt

Then WE SEE Amsterdam is kneeling at his fathers grave

AMSTERDAM
He never had his own cross Thanks
Now he STANDS and TURNS Jenny is half-hidden behind an elm tree

AMSTERDAM

Your touch is light but as a tracker you work awful heavy Come
ahead

Now that I met your mother you should come and meet my father

As Jenny starts to WALK towards the grave we see for the first time

that we are in the country a graveyard in an open field with an
astonishing PANORAMA of New York and the East River (MATTE) The
cemetery
is atop a hill and the East River busy with ferries and vessels of
trade glistens in the near distance Just beyond it is Manhattan
Island
low buildings winding narrow streets houses surrounded by open land
A
BREEZE off the river rustles Jennys dress and blows her hair as she
steps
up to the grave site looks at the headstone and sees

it is blank No name no date Clean stane

JENNY
You should finish the stone

AMSTERDAM

Itll be finished when everythings finished Thats when helll rest
The

hand that killed him is the hand that will bury him in peace

He holds up his open hand covered in dirt

JENNY
It was Bill killed him not you

AMSTERDAM
With my hand on the knife

JENNY
And his hand on yours

AMSTERDAM

And me feeling the life go out of my father He looked at me he
looked

at me and he swore me with his eyes I could feel his spirit I say
I

could feel it rising flowing through the knife like blood into my

own
heart

JENNY
You talk like he lives in you

AMSTERDAM
I dont want him to live I want him dead I kill Bill and Im free of
them both

JENNY

You think you can be free that easy You need your way so clear and
you use anything to clear it Anyone too Me everybody were all
just a way for you to settle your damned ghosts

AMSTERDAM

Youre part of me now like the gang is part of me and my father both

I can bring us to glory then my father like The Book saysmy

91 MONTAGE

The growth of the Dead Rabbits as we continue to HEAR Amsterdam speak
passionately to Jenny We first see the Rabbits surrounding and
OVERTURNING a fire wagon this starts as a live action scene but soon
BLEEDS into SEPIA then freezes like an old magazine illustration

AMSTERDAM (VO)

All of us is set on the same road together The gang can have
everything

they ever wanted and get me what I want while theyre doing it Were
not

interfering with each other were helping each other Its all the
same

were all one together

We CONTINUE with sepia illustrations of Dead Rabbit morts picking
pockets

and purses along a crowded Broadway climbing onto a wagon
distributing

newspapers and tossing off the occupants taking over the route
themselves swarming all over a merchant ship in the harbor as the
captain

doles out protection money to have his cargo unloaded

AMSTERDAM (VO)
Well all have a share of the profit like well all have a portion of
the

fame If we come to be notorious that only means were strong and if
were strong that means were ready

A sepia illustration of a fire wagon rounding a corner refurbished
and

manned by Rabbits all wearing striking uniforms with short capes
called

TAMLAS (NB they will be seen wearing the tanlas from these
uniforms

during all gang activity throughout the rest of the film Only Johnny
Amsterdam and Jenny do not wear them)

The sepia illustration turns to live action as the fire wagon TEARS
around

Paradise Square SCATTERING everyone in its path the Dead Rabbits
laughing their tamlas FLYING behind them

AMSTERDAM (VO)

And Ill know that time know it right off when it comes Just like I
new

Amsterdam as he is in the picture but in live action SPRINGING
to

his feet and YELLING at a couple of PRIZEFIGHTERS doing battle ina
ring

AMSTERDAM
Now Finish him now
Far up the sparkling Hudson a RAFT floats slowly upstream Its a
huge

thing (perhaps half a city block in size) crowded with SPORTSMEN They
form a LARGE RING around two mammoth PRIZEFIGHTERS who are brawling
with

bare knuckles Amsterdam and Johnny are among the spectators

JOHNNY
Our man will take him in another five What puts you in such a hurry

FIGHTER 1 fetches FIGHTER 2 a powerful roundhouse punch that sends him
CRASHING to the deck As soon as he hits the floor a CARD GIRL
appears

carrying a sign announcing Round 3711 SECONDS drag the stupefied
Fighter

2 to his corner while two BOYS minister to Fighter 1 SUCKING THE
BLOOD

off his knuckles

A GONG sounds to announce the appearance in the center of the ring
of
the fight promoter a florid and fulsome PT Barnum

BARNUM
I want to extend thanks and admiration not only to our two combatants
today but to their sponsors the Dead Rabbits
(indicates one side of the ring)
and the Native Americans

He FLINGS an expansive arm toward the opposite side of the ring where
Bill the Butcher sits with Daniel Killoran and a large group of
Natives

Amsterdam and the Butcher eye each other with all the old animosity
its

almost ceremonial now part of the Tradition

BARNUM

Their generous support allows me to bring you this splendid
exhibition

With their indulgence Id like to remind you also of the further
wonders

that await you at my new Museum located on Broadway

There are BOOS from the crowd at such untoward commercialism

BARNUM

PT Barnums gallery of wonders from worlds natural and unnatural
from nature and from myth
(continued boos)
And to encourage you also in the view that new Albany ordinances
forbidding sportive violence on land shouldnt dampen your enthusiasm
for
wagering Bets down entlegen and you gents
(indicated fighters)
fists up

The Fighters come to center ring circle each other then start
slugging

A flurry of punches and Fighter 2 GOES DOWN again As he hits the
deck

the round automatically ends and the between-rounds ritual takes place
again

JOHNNY
Dobbs will take him this round Thatll be something The Natives has
never lost before

AMSTERDAM
Because theres never been a Dead Rabbit fighting before

JOHNNY
Thatll shame them thorough

AMSTERDAM
Therell be worse than shaming We only got the Natives in range

Its time to squeeze the trigger John

The next round begins and the Fighters set to MAULING each other
furiously

JOHNNY
Dont push the Natives too far Amsterdam Otherwise itll be Tammany
pushing back

AMSTERDAM
That dont matter any more

JOHNNY

It does matter and its going to matter even more Tammanys the
heart

and future of this city If the Rabbits is going to keep growing
were

going to have to throw in with Tammany some way

The action in the ring is FURIOUS The Crowd cheers Fighter 1 seems
about
to go down but recovers and starts returning punishment to Fighter 2

JOHNNY

They got that Conscription Act from Washington keeping them busy but
they

wont leave us alone forever And the Natives is strong as they ever
been
In the ring Fighter 1 drives Fighter 2 to the deck again and this
time
KNOCKS HIM COLD

AMSTERDAM
(indicates Fighter 1)
You call that strong John

In the ring a couple of agitated NATIVE AMERICANS are trying to get
at

the Rabbit-sponsored winner RABBITS start to RUSH the ring but
Amsterdam

WAVES them back

AMSTERDAM
(to Johnny)
This is our time now

BARNUM

(trying to make official announcement)

The winner gentlemen please the winner in the 39th round is
the

Dead Rabbits champion High Water Dobbs please gentlemen

The unofficial ring COMBAT continues knocking Barnum about as the
new

champ throws marauding Natives around like empty flower sacks
Amsterdam

iumps into the fray PUSHES some Natives away They start for him but
the

champ stands them off while Amsterdam WHISPERS to Barnum

BARNUM

Just a moment please gentlemen Theres a word for us all Amsterdam
promises

(Amsterdam whispers to him briefly)

something large something grand something epic The greatest
these
are my own words of course the greatest righting of the gravest wrong
ever done in the Five Points

The crowd quiets their sporting blood still up curiosity engaged
Only
Johnny seems glum concerned

This is to be a duel not for money but for honor A fight to the
death

AMSTERDAM
(interrupting emphasizing)
To the death If he can stand up to it

BARNUM

on which money I hasten to add may certainly be wagered The
names
of the two champions are Amsterdam Vallon here beside me and and
Mr

William Poole known to all as

BILL THE BUTCHER
(leaping up)
They know me by any name you son of a bitch

The crowd ERUPTS this is a death match between Olympians Only Johnny
does not rejoice He looks at Amsterdams face flush with the belief
that

the right moment has finally come and he has to turn away He walks
away

from the ring as Killoran tries unsuccessfully to PULL the Butcher
down

and cool him off

BILL THE BUTCHER
(yelling)
Ill have him stretched on a spit

Killoran is beside him now whispering urgently Bill the Butcher
shakes
his head vehemently

BILL THE BUTCHER
(to Killoran)
You got no more to say about this now

AMSTERDAM
Come on Bill Let go of your Tammany wet nurse My challenge your
terms

KILLORAN

(to Bill)

Dont do it you cant do it Theres the Conscription to deal with
and

elections coming too Thats your calling now not these ancient
quarrels

BILL THE BUTCHER

Ill do my work But this is a shame a public shame It demands my
attention

(yelling to Amsterdam)
Fine then Fine and welcome Day after elections well meet with

done

He walks to the ring holds his HAND out to Amsterdam

treated us with sufferance and we must extend the same regard to
them

He has been beaten terribly but as he MOANS and starts to regain
consciousness the MOB WOMEN fall upon him with fresh fury KICKING
and

HITTING his helpless body They BREAK his bones with rocks and TEAR
OFF

the fancy braid of his uniform to hang around their necks

Now a SECOND MOB RUSHES toward the first from the opposite side of
Paradise Square Chaos Jenny is buffeted wildly Its like being ina
whirlpool She grabs a LITTLE GIRL whose face is bruised and blaody
but
whose eyes shine wildly

JENNY
What is it

LITTLE GIRL
Cops has everything closed to the north and the militias coming

CcuT TO
103 EXT STREETFIVE POINTS NIGHT

As Jenny presses her way through the mob-devoured streets She sees
MEN
WOMEN and CHILDREN attacking a small group of BLACKS

BOY
My Daddy dont have to die for you Why should he fight and die for
you

Jenny looks ahead sees the river in the distance And flames She
runs

forward STUMBLES Some of the swag FALLS to the street She SCRAMBLES
to

pick it up as Rioters rush by her

CcuT TO
104 EXT PIERS HUDSON RIVER NIGHT

MATTE The surface of the water looks like a mirror made of flame The
piers are BURNING The docks are ash

SAILORS battle a MOB for possession of a small rowboat As they fight
the
boat starts to DRIFT Jenny spots it RUNS for it

but so does ANOTHER GIRL Younger than Tenny--20 maybe Jennyls
age
when Amsterdam fell in love with her They both get to the boat at the
same time Each grips it by a gunwale and they STARE at each other
like
two jungle beasts over a kill

JENNY
Id kill you for this

The Girl lunges at her with a knite and Jenny SHOOTS The GIRL slides
into the flame-reflecting Hudson as if she drowning in a pit of lava

Jenny climbs into the boat and frantically starts to row We stay
CLOSE on
her working the oars clumsily furiously moving the boat
across
the water trying to get away from the city

and we go WIDER now A huge line of IRON--like the side of a
glacier bisects the frame then starts to move Jenny
turns SEES it It is

the looming hull of an ironclad war ship (MATTE) It LOBS cannon
fire
into the city setting off tremendous explosions
Jenny TURNS back for the shore

as cannonballs land devastating rioters
CUT TO
105 EXT SHORERIVER NIGHT

MATTE Police and MILITIA push the rioters back toward the river like
rats A cannanball EXPLODES in their midst

injuring many more cops and militia than rioters The rioters
rally
RUN over the bodies of fallen cops and soldiers Now the advantage is
theirs cops and militia are in retreat

Jenny climbs up on shore and joins the mob as it presses back inland

106 EXT DOYERS STREETTHE BLOODY ANGLE NIGHT

Further from the docks Shells still exploding in the distance Jenny
moves with the marauding mob recognizes Doyers Street She splits
away

from the mob moves stealthily into the street known as the Bloody
Angle

And STOPS

Weird shadows dance on the walls of the buildings SMOKE and EERIE
LIGHT

The angle is lined with lampposts And from every lamppost dangles the
BODY of a black man Or woman Or child Some are still smouldering

At the base of a lamppost a group of RIOTERS have cut open the hog-
tied

CORPSE of a black man and are pouring oil into it One of the Rioters
sees

Jenny grins and holds out the TORCH hes holding She shakes her head
and

starts to BACK out of the alley
The Rioter touches the torch to the oil in the wound of the corpse
The

body IGNITES in flame The RIOTERS pull on a rope and the body rises
burning to the top of the lamppost

where its awful shadow joins all the others in the madhouse
refractions on walls all up and down the street On the street as the
flames dance and the bodies burn rioters DANCE and SING Walpurgis

map

of the city against one wall the place has been converted from a
political princedom to an operational headquarters Johnny Sirocco and
Bill The Butcher are there Other guests include the GOVERNOR Mayor
Fernando Wood and a badly shaken Horace Greeley

GREELEY
They attacked me I had every sympathy for them at first

BOSS TWEED
Too much sympathy Horace Writing these riots were a rising against
unjust laws and unsuitable law-givers The shame

GOVERNOR

I suspended the draft at noon but the mobs only grew more virulent It
is

a criminal rising of the lowest class of the Gangsters and rabble who
have been allowed by Tammany to run lawless

BOSS TWEED

It was Tammany and the rabble that elected you Governor And its
Tammany

and the gangs wholl stop it Isnt that so Bill

BILL THE BUTCHER

I wont say nothin in front of him Who knows what business hes here
on

Hes here on our business and my invitation Hes already been of
great

help Whats the opposition strength John

To answer Johnny yanks back a CURTAIN drawn across a high window The
view looking downtown is one of almost continual ILLUMINATION--—

Against you

JOHNNY

Some of us come from those people Mayor Ill not deny they still
claim
part of me

MAYOR
Which part Perhaps your heart

BOSS TWEED

Gentlemen Im sorry you find it necessary to question the loyalty of
my

friend here and by extension my own judgement So as proof John
where will the mob go What will the gangs do

(Johnny is uneasy about answering)

Go on tell them what you told me

JOHNNY
Theres no telling about the mob Or the small gangs But the Dead
Rabbits

if I was Amsterdam

BOSS TWEED
(interrupting)
As indeed you nearly was Were

JOHNNY
if I was Id figure to take the Rabbits to the Armory

BOSS TWEED
Would you agree with that Bill Wouldnt you do the same If you were
fighting against the militia instead of beside them

BILL THE BUTCHER
Beside them What are you talking

BOSS TWEED

(interrupting)

You will have to fight beside them to take the Armory It cannot fall
into

unfriendly hands

BILL THE BUTCHER

I cant stand with the militia against the people I could never work

Im sure that Bill will do his usual splendid job But after that
well Im afraid hes grown away from us

(Johnny looks puzzled)

He shows distressing signs of shall we say free-thinking Crime
flourishes in chaos and these riots could encourage Bill to overstep
himself He no longer inspires in me the same trust well that you

might If you can prove yourself further

JOHNNY
You already said in front of everyone you trusted me

In vital things Would I be talking to you now otherwise Vital

but small things Are you equal to greater responsibility and
opportunity

JOHNNY

Amsterdam leads Johnny off to a shadowy corner of the room where they
can

JOHNNY

I know what youre doing I told Tweed what youre doing

AMSTERDAM
You dont know what Im doing

JOHNNY
Youre going after the Armory

Cause thats what I would do and you and I think alike

Bill walks alone toward the Nativemilitia lines

From inside from every window the Dead Rabbits watch him

The sun is high but the street is eerily quiet There are FARAWAY
SOUNDS

of battle but here there is only the sound of distant unheard
conversation between Bill the Militia Commander and some Natives

Amsterdam WATCHES intently

The Butcher and the Militia Commander argue but we still cant hear
what
theyre saying There is still no sound

until SUDDENLY we see the Militia Commanders face Huge EYES
WIDE
with surprise as we HEAR the thunderclap of a SHOT

Bill the Butcher has just gutshot the Militia Commander

As if the shot were a signal the Natives TURN on the militia Its
hellish close-quarter combat Guns fired inches from enemies who had
just

been allies Knives swords bludgeons kids with dead-rat blackjacks
women with hob-nailed wooden planks attacking better-armed but
totally

stunned soldiers

Bill the Butcher falls back toward the Armory the Natives following
him

Inside the Armory Amsterdam turns to his own greatly diminished gang

AMSTERDAM
Go ahead them give them cover Give them some damn cover

The Rabbits are so stunned to be fighting on the same side as their
sworn

enemies that even with Amsterdams order no one makes a move Its
Amsterdam who FIRES the first shots And that unleashes a great VOLLEY
from the Armory

toward the militia

The Butcher and the Natives are closer to the Armory now and the
Armory
doors start to open

when a MILITIA LIEUTENANT SIGNALS

and MILITIA on the surrounding roofs waiting for this moment
suddenly open fireon the Natives below and on the Rabbits on the
roof
of the armory Many drop in the street and fall from the Armory
roof

as the Armory doors SWING WIDE to admit the Natives As they run
or
stagger inside the Rabbits start to close the doors Some Rabbits are
cut
down by the fire from the rooftops Other Natives never make it to the
doors And a few are shot

when the doors close before they can get through

Amsterdam MOTIONS toward the rear wall and Jimmy swings the cannon
around

Everything surrounding them is MOVEMENT and COMMOTION as the remaining
members of both gangs TAKE whatever weapons they can carry from the
Armory

stockpile

and Jenny steps forward with a torch LIGHTING the fuse of the
cannon

which ROARS and BLOWS a huge hole in the rear wall of the Armory
