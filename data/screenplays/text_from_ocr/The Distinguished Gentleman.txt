FADE IN

1 A FLASH OF LIGHT
A radiant shiny something dazzling in EXTREME CLOSEUP
BEGIN TITLES
CAMERA very slowly PULLS BACK The sparkling surface
turns out to be a lot of carats WE SEE the stone then

the ring then suddenly in bg something HUGE SWEEPS
by REVEAL a mechanical claw above the ring hanging
from a crane The ring sits in a sea of tiny dolls

joke eyeballs and other carnival junk
The claw descends on the ring again and again sometimes
catching it for a moment then tragically dropping it --
accompanied by OOHS and AAHS (0S) of hope and disap-
pointment INTERCUT with the HANDS of a young black man
working the controls The EYES of a young black woman
watching him work Another guys HANDS digging in his
pocket for change QUARTERS going into the slot
MANS VOICE (0S)
Thisll never work Tommy
TOMMY (0S)
Be positive Armando Course it will
The claw inadvertently snags a rabbits foot
TOMMY (0S)
Look See what a lucky fuck I am
WOMANS VOICE (0S)
He dont mean the ring hon he
means the whole plan

TOMMY (0S)
So do I
The claw catches the ring and closes on it QUICK CUTS
of their FACES as the crane rises A very pretty lady
A beefy Latino with a two-day beard Their apprehension
Tommys confidence Then his exceptional smile He gets
the ring
INT PENNY ARCADE - DAY

TOMMY
Okay -- one down one to go
(returning to the
claw)
You got quarters Loretta

head of Gulf Coast Power but to a
country boy like me --

Johnson smiles at the direction the conversation is
taking
