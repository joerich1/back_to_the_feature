EXT SALLY’S WOODS - MASSAPEQUA LONG ISLAND - DAY THE SUNleafy treessummer

A FACE angelic womanly etched in a broad sunburst calls
A FACE we do not understand or will ever see again

VOICE
Ronnie Ronnie

The last Ronnie drawn out slowing downsuggesting
something mystical now burning out into the sun as

RONNIE 10 looks hears it crouched - a stubby crewcut
knees patched with denim his plastic gun in hand relieved
as

TIMMY runs up small and vulnerable in a clumsy crouch a GI
helmet on his head gun

RONNIE
D’you hear it

what TIMMY
at

RONNIE doesn’t answer He wonders then forgets as he HEARS
legs tearing through bush fast Loud FX Starts looks

RONNIE
Let’s go let’s go We got ’en
we got ‘em -

RONNIE and TIMMY up and moving FAST across trees and tangle
an extended OVERHEAD TRACK drawing out the tension as -

INSECTS BUZZ louderlouder

oO TIMMY
Watch out

20a DIRTBOMB thuds with loud FX on the chest of RONNIE who
SCREAMS as TIMMY spins terrified and

A HUGE FIGURE hurtles down out of the tree smacking the
ground hard - painted face sweat a crown of thorns

TWO MORE BOYS - JOEY WALSH and TOMMY FINNELLI follow
thudding to the ground yelling war cries

RONNIE fallen to the ground scrambles to get his Mattel
gun up but

STEVIE is right on top of hin digging his plastic tommygun
right into RONNIE’s facehe is a big frightening 10 year
old and he has blackened his cheekbones in a child’s

version of an Indian warrior and in an added touch of the
macabre blackened all his teeth which now shine ina
twisted mouth of cruelty and certainty

C) 1

STEVIE
You’re DEAD and you know it

RONNIE looking up into that face as
The blast of the weapon goes off in RONNIE’s face

STEVIE

Ronnie’s dead

EXT MASSAPEQUA PARADE - DAY

BOOM the huge sound of a BASS DRUM as CREDITS ROLL AND
A NUBILE BLONDE with big cowboy boots and gigantic boobs and
long blonde hair BEATS her drum and

HORNS MUSIC and the BAND (marked the Massaperjia Long
‘Island High School Marching Band) tears inte John Phillip
Sousa and it’s the Fourth of July and

WHACK WHACK WHACK The firecrackers blast off in red
white blue An artillery attack over Massapequa and THE
SUBTITLE READS JULY 4 1957

and RONNIE rides the shoulders of his DAD in a TRACKING
SHOT along the crowd framed in such a way that we have the
impression RONNIE is floating above the crowd ecstatic
waving his red white and blue flag up at the crackers -
the greatest day of his life ‘

RONNIE
Daddy -look at the firecrackers
Look a

DAD is muscular stocky a kind face late 30’s thinning
hair looking up too

DAD
Hey look at that

In the confusion of the crowd now coming astride MOM - a
handsome woman pregnant with a somewhat tired face
slightly pinched - also waving a flag

With her 2 YOUNGER SONS and a DAUGHTER SUSANNE 12 TOMMY
6 is pulling on DAD’s arm jumping up and down

RONNIE looking out from his perch at

A FLOAT OF AMERICANA (marked Massapequa USA) motoring down
Broadway Young TEENAGERS populate it like strawberries
Followed by

THE NASSAU COUNTY MOTORCYCLE COPS - gleaming chrome and
black leather the scouts doing wheelies on the back tires
of their machines crowd APPLAUSE

MOM has caught TOMMY and spanks hin hard on the sidewalk a
quick flash of HYSTERIA

MOM
What’s the matter with you don’t
ya ever listen

TOMMY has the sullen eyes of the perpetual loser in these
quarrels MOM slaps him up again on the buttocks

MOM

He stares stupidly at her as if saying “hit me again’ as

THE CLOWNS dance by behind and a 10 year old GIRL (DONNA)
whips up stops runs off again chased by her FATHER

FATHER

THE SUBTITLE NOW READS JANUARY 20 1961

KENNEDY
Let the word go forth from this
time and place to friend and foe

alike that the torch has been
passed to a new generation of
Americans -- born in this century
tempered by war disciplined by a
hard and bitter peace proud of our
ancient heritage -- and unwilling
to witness or permit the slow
undoing of those human rights to

‘Which this nation has always been
committed and to which we are
committed today at home and around
the world

responsibility -- I welcome it I

do not believe that any of us would

exchange places with any other

from that fire can truly light the

tableau of a FISHING VILLAGE spread over several DUNES along
the South China SEA bordering on a RICE PADDY

ANOTHER SECTION OF THE VILLAGE a TINY HAMLET sits in a
woodline astride the inland paddy

The WIND is sowing confusion

The fresh-faced LIEUTENANT listens over the radio and barks

orders at RON over the wind

LIEUTENANT
Red Platoon’s receiving fire on the
northwest edge of the ville NVA
suspects are coming this way

RON alert listening now to the imagined sound of distant

gunfire

LIEUTENANT
(points)
--set your squad in a line along
the dune

He’s very excited repeating his orders
LIEUTENANT
I think we got ’em I think we got
‘em this time Sergeant

Their POV -- through the rain -- the village Hard to see
anything

A GRAVEYARD

In the distance some movement in the village

LIEUTENANT
(very excited now)
You see Look they got rifles
Can you see the rifles Ccan you
see them

RON looking very hard through the rain

RON
Yes I see them I see them

LIEUTENANT
(puts his arm around him)
Tell them when I give the order I
i wanna light this ville up like a
fucking Christmas tree --- okay
Get going

Turning back to his radio overly keyed

KovVIC running down the line sinking in the sand his baggy
poncho flopping over the gear on his back

2 31
Suddenly SEVERAL FIGURES break from the huts running

As RON runs down the straggled LINE OF MEN someone starts
firing from the end with his M-16 Now the whole line
suddenly erupts pulling their triggers without thinking
emptying everything they have into the huts across the
graveyard

RON yelling trying to get his men to stop the fire
Voices screaming in the distance

RON looking at the LIEUTENANT running up the line yelling
across the sand

LIEUTENANT
What happened Goddamn it what
happened Who gave the order to
fire I wanna know who gave the —
order to fire

Everybody is looking at everybody else with that peculiar
awkwardness of a platoon without real leadership

RON
We better get akiller team out

there sir

LIEUTENANT

All right all right Sergeant get
out there with Molina and tell me
how many we got

The VOICES continue to scream from the village an eerie
wailing amid the noise of rain

RON moving to assemble FIVE MEN

The LIEUTENANT on the radio there seems to be increased
fire from the distance coming across the radio Incipient
panic building

RON leading his five men across the dunes into the edges of
the village

The Voices the screams continuing RON knows
something is wrong the rain beating on his face as he moves
cautiously to the lip of the hut

MOLINA is alongside him They both turn into the hut and
see it at the same time

MOLINA
Oh God Oh Jesus Christ

RON’s eyes convey the horror

INT HUT DAY - RAIN 32

The floor of the small hut is covered with CHILDREN
screaming and thrashing their arms back and forth lying in
pools of blood crying wildly screaming again and again
They’re shot in the face in the chest in the legs moaning
and crying

RON
Oh Jesus

The LIEUTENANT’S VOICE now blasting in on the radio

LIEUTENANT
Tango Two how many you got

An old OLD MAN in the corner with his head blown off from
his eyes up his brains hanging out of his head like
jelly

RON keeps looking at the strange sight he’s never seen
anything like it before

A SMALL BOY next to the old man is still alive though shot
many times He’s crying softly lying in a large pool of
blood His small foot has been shot off almost completely
and hangs by a thread

- LIEUTENANT
(voice)
What‘s going on’ What’s going on
up there
MOLINA
(voice)

You better get up here fast
Lieutenant There’s a lot of
wounded people up here

A SMALL GIRL moaning now shot through the stomach
RON feels crazy weak helpless staring at them

The other THREE MARINES are looking staring down at the
floor like it’s a nightmare like it’s some kind of dream
and it really isn’t happening

RON suddenly erupts jerking the green medical bag off his
back ripping it open and grabbing for bandages Trying
to help the gut-shot girl tamping the blood

RON
Let’s help them Help them
It’s gonna be okay It’s gonna
be okay

32

He moves to the next body

--and the next trying to help trying to speak but he
can’t His fingers searching for the holes the bullets have
made bandaging each as quickly as he can his shaking hands
wet with the blood It’s raining into the hut and a cold
wind sweeps his face as he cries now crying and still
trying to bandage them up

The LIEUTENANT runs up with the OTHERSradio voices are
more and more urgent in the background

RON
‘Help me Somebody help me

The LIEUTENANT looking not quite understanding

LIEUTENANT
Where are their rifles

MOLINA
There’re no rifles

A blank look on the LIEUTENANT’S face He screams to his
men
LIEUTENANT
Well help him then

The MEN stand in the doorway but they do not move

LIEUTENANT
Help him help him I’m ordering
you to help hin

But THE MEN are not moving and some of them are crying now
dropping their rifles and sitting down on the wet ground
weeping with their hands against their faces

SEVERAL MEN
Oh Jesus oh God -forgive us
MOLINA
Forgive us for what we’ve done
LIEUTENANT

(screaming)
Get up What do you think this
is I’m ordering you all to get
up

Some of them slowly crawling over the bodies grabbing for
the bandages that are still left

As she hurries off a CORPSMAN rushes over and jumps on the BLACK
MAN’s chest putting his knees right on it and pounding the chest
with a fist

A DOCTOR and the NURSE push the heart pump machine over

CORPSMAN
It’s stopped

The DOCTOR hands a syringe to THE CORPSMAN who plunges it into the
BLACK MAN’s chest like a knife as the DOCTOR grabs a long suction
cup attached to the machine and places it carefully over the
patient’s chest

CORPSMAN
I think he’s gone

The DOCTOR motions THE CORPSMAN off hurriedly as he climbs up on
top of the body

ANOTHER ANGLE - the face of the BLACK MAN is now puffy like a
balloon saliva rolling from the sides of it - staring the whites
of his eyes rolling upwards

a grotesque dance Then falls back
