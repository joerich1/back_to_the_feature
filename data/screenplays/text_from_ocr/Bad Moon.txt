EXT JUNGLE - NEPAL - NIGHT

The full moon now visible in the darkened sky

EXT CAMP NEPAL - NIGHT

The Native Guides stoke the coals of the fire with sticks
They listen to the SOUNDS of the MONKEYS BIRDS and INSECTS
in the dense trees lining the perimeter of the clearing

They hear the SOFT SIGHS coming from the one tent The
Natives exchange grins and shake their heads as they tend the
fire

Then all SOUNDS of WILDLIFE abruptly cease

Silence

The Native Guides lift their heads alert The jungle is
totally preternaturally quiet One man rises to his feet
uneasily He nervously looks around him at the darkened
clearing It is pitch black on all sides beyond the dim glow
of the campfire

The horses in the stalls begin to snort and paw the earth
with their hoofs The horses suddenly rear and yank at their
tethers Their wild eyes stare into the dark silent jungle
Three Natives begin babbling anxiously to one another

Suddenly a LOW GROWL emanates from the brush Like a wolf
But not

PRAM Tanron sy

The horses rip loose of their posts and gallop off in panic
into the jungle

INT TENT - CAMP NIGHT

The Photographer and The Naturalist make passionate love ina
sleeping bagTheir erotic sighs and exclamations drown out
all noises outside the tent

EXT CAMP - NIGHT

Fear explodes across the Guides faces They are frozen in
place paralyzed with terror One looks over to see his
rifle resting against his tent twenty yards away

Three Natives scream and bolt into the jungle

Two more of the Natives run off in the’ other direction

GROWL

With a cry of terror the remaining Native Guide runs for his

rifle

A WEREWOLF drops out of the trees and goes for the man’s
throat

Bloodshot insane eyesSalivating fangsHairy half-man
half-wolf featuresHuge claws The creature is half-seen
a psychopathic-eyed apparition of fangs claws and fur in
the firelight The Native Guides screams are cut short as
he is torn to shreds by the Werewolf

INT TENT - CAMP - NIGHT
The Photographer and the Naturalist are still making love in
the sleeping bag Over their passionate sighs he hears

something outside the tent He lifts his head

PHOTOGRAPHER
Did you hear something

She nibbles his lip

NATURALIST
Um-hinmmm

They kiss and continue what they were doing

EXT CAMP - NEPAL - NIGHT

The Werewolf heaves the Native Guides corpse into the trees
The creature rears in the firelight its talons and jaws
dripping with gore

Its crazed bloodshot eyes focus on the tent across the
clearing

WEREWOLF POV BandW ITS HEART POUNDING IN ITS CHEST

ITS BLOOD ROARING IN ITS EARS THE SOFT HUMAN SIGHS FROM THE
TENT THE TENT MAKING ITS WAY SWIFTLY ACROSS THE
CLEARINGTOWARDS THE TENT

INT TENT - CAMP - NIGHT

The Photographer rolls on top of the Naturalist in the
sleeping bag Her eyes widen as she sees the hideously
unnatural silhouette of the Werewolf réar up outside the
tent She screams hysterically The Photographer whirls
just as the huge razor-clawed paw shears through the tent
canvas She tries to crawl away but the creature gets a
fistful of her hair It drags her right off her feet outside
the tent The Werewolf buries its jaws into her The girl
screams and flails hysterically as she is held off the ground
and ripped apart by the Werewolf The man sees only flashes
of claws and snapping fangs amid the flying fur

NATURALIST
TEDOHMYGOOOQ000--HELPHELP

PHOTOGRAPHER
NOOOOO

The Photographer leaps at the Werewolf
It whirls on him slashing its razor fangs across his torso
His shoulder is torn open and he is tossed fifteen feet

The man lands on the ground by the backpacks his shoulder
mauled

His vision is BLURRY semi-conscious He sees the thing toss
the girls dead body away like a rag doll

And it comes for him
The Photographer sees a shotgun By the packs

He grabs up the shotgun and PUMPS a CARTRIDGE into the
BREECH

He aims it at the Werewolf

The creature dives for him with a psychopathic SCREECH
talons extended

The man aims blindly pulling the trigger
BABOOOQOOOOQOQOOOCOOOMMMMMMMM

He blows the Werewolfs head clean off

It drops decapitated in the dirt killed instantly

The Photographer slumps out cold on the ground his eyes
rolled up in their sockets

She reaches down to slip her finger into the metal ring of
Thors collar As she does so she takes her eyes off Flopsy
for a moment

Flopsy makes deliberate eye contact with Thor

Thor sees Flopsy make a quick flailing movement with his
free hand over Moms neck Like he is about to punch her

BRETT
HEY

That does it

With a violent growl Thor leaps He hits Flopsy full in the
chest with front and hind legs dropping him like a bowling
pin The ninety pound German Shepherd pins him to the
pavement police dog style Flopsy looks in terror at the
bared fangs of the dog at his throat -

FLOPSY

Mom pulls a small white card out of her wallet and tosses it
contemptuously to Flopsy

JANET

Before Flopsy can react Janet reaches down and jerks the
jacket from the mans shoulder There is no wound

JANET
I dont see what youre going to sue for
except maybe the price of a new suit at
K-Mart

FLOPSY
Hey listen lady I dont care if you

if you dont want to settle fine I
wont sue you Ill go to the humane
society and show them what he did Ill

Baffled Thor looks back and forth between Mom and Flopsy
He lets out a low GROWL

JANET
Get in the house Thor

Mom points the dog towards the house If possible the
German Shepherd is on the verge of tears of confusion and
shame He has no choice He does what he is told Thor
slinks away tail between his legs He slumps on the porch
and watches the heated interchange between his master and the

stranger who apparently threatened Mom

Mom faces Flopsy furiously as the man lies on the ground

JANET
Did he bite you

Flopsy hesitates
JANET
Because if he bit you youll have to see
a doctor right now Since youre on
foot Ill give you a lift to the nearest
hospital emergency room right now

FLOPSY

The con man fidgets like a pinned bug Thor watches Moms
demeanor from the sidelines and his German Shepherd jowls
break into a loose grin as he sees whatever it is going on
Mom is winning

JANET

The man explodes in anger
Thor leaps up on his haunches and BARKS violently
Mom whirls on Thor and roars ferociously
- JANET
STAY
With a dismal WHINE of dismay Thor miserably hangs back on
the stoop His eyes still remain protectively fixed on
Flopsy
JANET
Now my advice to you is to turn around

and without looking back

The humiliated con man stumbles away up the sidewalk He
wags his finger at Janet

A rugged mountainous expanse of pine forest A flashlight
cuts through the trees A HIKER with a backpack treks along
the moonlit pine forest path He stops and checks his watch
He takes a map out of his jacket and checks his coordinates
He takes out his compass Clearly lost he puts his gear
back in his jacket

And hikes on into the dark forest rs

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

The moon hovers over the vast timber country

EXT TRAIL - FOREST —- NIGHT

A flashlight beam glints through the pine branches The
Hiker comes down the trail small and alone He is dwarfed
by the huge pine trees using his flashlight to make his way
The SOUNDS of the FOREST WILDLIFE fill the SOUNDTRACK BIRDS
INSECTS OWLS A STEADY OUTDOORSY DIN The Hiker stops to
get his bearings shining his flashlight on the trees
Silvery moonlight filters through the branches in misty
shafts The man adjusts his backpack and moves on The
SOUND of his BOOTS CRUNCHING TWIGS

Then suddenlyall the ANIMAL NOISES in the forest stop
Silence

The Hiker stops and listens-to the uncanny preternatural
quiet Apprehension registers on his features Its as if
all the wildlife in the woods have been scared silent

From far off a TERRIFYING WOLFLIKE HOWL rips the air The
Hiker is petrified by the half-wolf half-human cry He

turns pale hurrying on at a brisk pace down the path
flitting his flashlight beam ahead

The WOLFLIKE ROAR reverberates through the forest again
This time much closer

The Hiker looks over his shoulder but sees only walls of
trees The circle of his flashlight beam begins to dim
Then it darkens and goes out The Hiker swears below his
breath barely able to see in the moonlit forest Beaded
with sweat he fumbles in his backpack for a battery He
frantically inserts it into his flashlight The beam of
light blinks back on

The SOUND of a HUGE ANIMAL SMASHING THROUGH THE TREES AND
BRANCHES of the FOREST

The Hiker cries out in fear and runs for his life He heaves
off his backpack and bolts up the trail Looking over his
shoulder he sees something shattering through the branches
fifty feet behind him The huge shape is covered with fur
its claws glinting in the moonlight The Hiker runs panic-
stricken through the forest The ROARS of the thing fill his
ears The Hiker scrambles up a tree shimmying ten feet up
to the first branches He tries to climb higher Suddenly
the tree is shaken powerfully heaving him sideways He
shines his flashlight down at the creature shaking the tree

A Werewolf

The Hiker screams in raw terror and heaves the flashlight
between the Werewolfs eyes It bounces off the creatures
skull The Werewolf flies into a psychopathic rage chewing
and scratching at the tree Bark and wood pulp fly like from
a chain saw The Hiker holds on for dear life as the tree is
violently shaken back and forth He tries to climb higher
but cant The Werewolf is swiftly gnawing through the trunk
of the tree trying to break it in half

A CRACK of SPLINTERING WOOD

The Hiker screams helplessly as the tree he hangs onto starts
to topple The Werewolf waits for him with fangs bared and
claws outstretched as the tree breaks

The Hiker falls head over heels into the clutches of the
Werewolf

And is torn to pieces

Suddenly something leaps out of a bush

Thor leaps back with an startled bark

It is only a school of sparrows They wing off into the sky
Thor relaxes

Just as a severed human arm out falls out of tree and lands
on his back

The dog barks in alarm as he spots the corpse A pile of
savaged mutilated meat strewn on the ground and all the way
up into the trees A blood-splashed hiking boot dangles from
a branch twenty feet up

medical books open and scattered around the closet Notes
and complex chemistry equations are scribbled on notepads and
all over the walls The area has the atmosphere of feverish
frantic research The little boy looks around the closet
eyeing the medical setup in astonishment

Something catches Bretts eye
An ancient antique book on the floor

And pushes into the clearing

INT CLEARING - WOODS - NIGHT

The branches part

And Thor is face to face with A WEREWOLF
It is handcuffed to a big tree

Though it is manlike in size and build it is hideously
unnatural The Werewolfs face and body are completely
covered with thick patches of black pubic-like hair Covered
with fur it stands upright on its hind legs with its front
legs wrapped around the tree trunk held together by Uncle
Teds handcuffs It wears Uncle Teds sweatpants and the
ragged remains of his sweatshirt and a small metal object
dangles from a chain around its neck The key to the
handcuffs Its face distends in a wolf-like snout Two

-grotesquely long fangs protrude from its exposed gums Its

fangs are sharp and very dangerous-looking It has been
trying to cut through the tree trunk with them and has
gnawed a big hunk out of the tree before giving up on the
idea

The Werewolf hasn’t seen Thor yet

The German Shepherd backs slowly silently into the
surrounding bushes then edges in for a closer look

The Werewolf is chained to the lone tree in the clearing and
the moon now high in the sky beams down on it like a
spotlight The creatures attention is torn between the
moon and the handcuffs that bind it It struggles awhile
tires then gazes upward It glowers at the moon its face a
picture of hate The only sound that comes from the
Werewolf is the same constant LOW GROWL Thor had heard in the
distance

The German Shepherd watches the creature with a mixture of
apprehension and befuddlement Thor sniffs the ground and
locates one of Uncle Teds sneakers He sniffs it looks at
the Werewolf and a WHINE of confusion escapes his throat

The Werewolf hears him and snaps his head around to see the
interloper

At the sight of Thor the Werewolf flies into a mad rage

Thor tenses and bares his teeth ready to fight but the
handcuffs restraining the creature hold The Werewolf cant

attack Instead it twists itself around the tree to face
Thor snarling growling pulling at the handcuffs and
snapping at the air the whole time The Werewolfs fury
makes it foam at the mouth and despite its helpless state
it shows no fear only rage Even helpless locked to the
tree it urges Thor closer wanting any opportunity to try to
kill him

It is utterly mad
Their eyes meet
Thor freezes

The Werewolfs eyes are neither canine nor human but
resembling both

Its psychotic anarchic gaze seems to beckon to Thor
inviting him to join the Werewolf in its wildness in its
freedom in its madnessits power to kill Thor stares as
if hypnotized struggling against the primal seduction of raw
animal bloodlust

The German Shepherd shakes to his very Pones unable to break
the creatures gaze

THE HIGH SHRILL SOUND OF A DOG WHISTLE PIERCES ‘THORS LARS
And snaps the hold the Werewolf has over him

Regaining his senses Thor BARKS SAVAGELY FURIOUSLY at the

a flickering flashlight beam Its eyes gleam with an insane
lust that sends a ripple of terror through Thor

JANET OS
THOR HERE THOR THOR

Thor throws a glance in Moms direction Janet is getting
closer The dog turns one last time to the Werewolf and
bares his teeth in warning Then he hurries off through the
clearing to stop Mom

When the Werewolf sees that Thor is leaving it explodes It
epens its mouth wide issuing a loud voiceless hateful
hiss It thrashes its head and shoulders from side to side in
mindless fury frantically trying to break the handcuffs or
the tree itself The handcuffs cut into its wrists It

bites the tree trunk with its teeth again It takes as much
of the trunk into its jaws as it can then lifts its hind
legs and kicks against the tree like a cat Bark spit and
blood fly

INT KITCHEN - HARRISON HOUSE - DAY 75

Janet cooks Uncle Ted sits down Thor takes a protective
position between them Brett is watching Werewolf of
London on the VCR Uncle Ted casts a jaundiced eye at the
television showing Henry Hull as he stares nervously at the
full moon hovering in the sky He stares in horror at the
bad special effects on his hand growing hairy Uncle Ted
guffaws

BRETT
Its not funny Hes turning
into The Wolfman

UNCLE TED
Sorry Brett its the full moon part
In the movies the guy only turns into a
Werewolf when theres a full moon

BRETT
Thats the way it works When theres a
full moon he turns into the Werewolf
Everybody knows that

( )

Rev 41996 (p)

Uncle Ted scratches his jaw thoughtfully

UNCLE TED
But why only when theres a full moon
Why not any moon

BRETT
Because thats how werewolves work And
you have to shoot them with a silver
bullet

UNCLE TED
I bet if you blew ones head off with a
shotgun that would do quite nicely

BRETT
Dont you know anything about werewolves

UNCLE TED
I know that you turn into one if you get
bit by one I know you get hairy But
that part about the full moonMaybe
theres different kinds of werewolves
but its been my experience that any old
moon will do the trick Werewolf-wise

Brett looks at Uncle Ted

BRETT
Have you ever met a Werewolf

UNCLE TED i
Oh Ive been acquainted with a few in my
time Have you

BRETT
Cmon everybody knows theres no such

Woke the whole house up Youre lucky

World War Three started Anyway I
finally let him out and heran into the
woods and didnt come back I tried
calling him with the dog whistle but he
just barked

Unele Ted turns his back casually so his sister doesnt see
his face is white with fear

UNCLE TED

Uncle Ted tries to keep his tone nonchalant

UNCLE TED
So what do you think it was all about

JANET
I have no idea but Im not too worried
Thor barks at practically anything

Uncle Ted seems be be undergoing an inner struggle

UNCLE TED
Well I dont know sis Big predators

safe If I were you I wouldnt let the

Uncle Ted pulls a drape away from the window Sees Thor
still on the grass Closes the drape

‘Thor makes himself comfortable on the grass

Uncle Ted looks out the window again

Finally he comes out on the landing He stands looking down

at Thor for a moment then looks over his shoulder at the
blackening eastern horizon With a look of resignation on
his face he tentatively starts down the stairs pausing
briefly on each step to gauge Thors réaction

Thor sits in place watching him

Uncle Ted sets foot on the pavement less than three feet
from Thor who sits motionless the whole time

Slightly emboldened and growing more desperate by the second
Uncle Ted cautiously begins walking towards the woods Thor
immediately gets up and follows him maintaining a constant
distance of about ten feet between them

Uncle Ted turns on the German Shepherd angrily with his arm
held out straight pointing towards the house

Thor sits by the kitchen door staring sentry-like out’ the
window at the Airstream and the backyard in the morning
light

He doesnt have to wait long

Through the window he sees Uncle Ted step from the woods

He walks hunched over clutching his bloodied ankle with one
hand Thor GROWLS quietly to himself He watches Uncle Ted
with growing hostility as the man hops up the stairs to his
trailer The door closes Thor lies down on the floor
knowing the pack is safe for awhile

SHERIFF JENSON
Is this the man who approached your place
last month

JANET
Yes

SHERIFF JENSON
Hes dead

Janet gasps

SHERIFF JENSON
His name was Walter Mills «I hit him in
my patrol car tonight respending to your
call He ran out into the middle of the
road and I didnt have time to stop
But the thing of it is the car isnt
what killed him He bore the marks of an
animal attack He had been torn open
By a big animal Like a wolf Or

Janet holds the Sheriffs gaze

JANET
Or a dog is that it

SHERIFF JENSON
Yes Maam I do recall you told me that
Thor almost took a bite out of Mills the
other day Now maybe tonight when Mills
came back Thor went at him again

The woman rubs her eyes

Janet picks up Uncle Teds journal and fingers it She looks
at Sheriff Jenson deeply disturbed

JANET
You know about these slayings up in the
Skyline area Those hikers that were
mutilated

SHERIFF JENSON
Yes Janet Im in daily contact with
the Skyline Law Enforcement people
Were keeping a watch on the paths of the
killings But that wouldnt be the same
animal that killed Mills It would have
had to travel two hundred miles from
Skyline to get here and--

JANET
No thats not it My question is Is
‘there any possibility that the killings
were committed by ahuman being

Sheriff Jenson shakes his head

SHERIFF JENSON
No chance at all Janet They were done
by a big animal No man could tear a
person apart the way the beast that
butchered those people did Same with
Mills tonight Wolves are the probable
culprits Very very big wolves But
not aman Not humanly possible Why do
you ask

Janet rubs her eyes worried

JANET
I dont know

Janet ponders most uneasy Sheriff Jenson grabs his hat
Goes to the door

SHERIFF JENSON
I reckon thats all for now Janet
Well be in touch Just one thing I
know you love Thor And if he did tear
up Mills he was doin so to protect you
But once a dog becomes a biter gets a
taste for human blood he becomes
dangerous With all due respect Maam

stumbles back stunned as Mom slips on the grass and falls
backwards pulling Thor with her Thor finds his balance
digs his claws into the ground and pulls violently to get at
Uncle Ted snapping his head from side to side and choking
himself in the process Uncle Ted stumbles back towards the
Airstream as blood runs down his arm soaking his torn shirt
sleeve and coating his hands
