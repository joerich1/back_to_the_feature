FADE IN
EXT FOREST RIDGE - DAWN

Steam and dust roils through the purple air Shapes appear
slowly getting closer gaining definition

ANOTHER ANGLE

SCIENTISTS in biosafety suits move up a ridge like astronauts
DR JONAS GUILLEMOT 50s leads the group features sober
through his Plexiglas face-shield as they arrive at a military

barricade SOLDIERS in biosafety suits block with automatic
weapons Guillemot raises his credentials

GUILLEMOT
Hello I’m Dr Jonas Guillemot From
the International Intelligence
Committee

A black female officer LIEUTENANT COMMANDER JILL NEALY 30s
appears behind the line of soldiers She’s a head shorter than
everyone around her but has the presence and command of a
giant Her eyes tell the soldiers to stand down

NEALY
Dr Guillemot we’ve been expecting
you

ANOTHER ANGLE
The team follows Nealy up the ridge --

NEALY
I apologize for all the security But
as you know this area has been blocked
off until we have secure intel on the
matter

GUILLEMOT
We were told an explosion was
documented at four forty-one this
morning Do you know what caused it

NEALY
We have a pretty good idea

They crest the ridge Guillemot pauses His eyes fill with
awe

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Through the rolling bed of steam a breathtaking sight

A one hundred yard radius of giant redwoods are laying on their
sides pointing outward in every direction like a wagon-wheel

At the epicenter of the carnage something dark and metallic is
buried beneath the branches The tip of a very large iceberg

EXT FOREST CLEARING - DAWN

The scientists spread out mingling with the SOLDIERS They
move carefully among the fallen giants approaching the buried
metallic object There’s frost everywhere covering everything
They talk over each other in excitement

SCIENTIST 1
I’m not picking up any radiation
Check your equipment

SCIENTIST 2
(overlapping)
Where did it come from GPS should
have picked this up right

SOLDIER 1
Negative We’ve checked all the sat
eyes on these coordinates This came
out of nowhere

SCIENTIST 2
What do you mean it came out of
nowhere Are you telling us it just
appeared out of thin air

As they continue talking and taking readings --

CLOSE ON GUILLEMOT

gaping as he moves into the shadows of the dark metallic object
It’s the hull of a vessel the size of a small ferry One thing

is for certain it’s not of this world

GUILLEMOT
This isn’t ours

NEALY
No it’s not

Guillemot is overcome with emotion He’s been waiting for this
moment his entire life He moves into the hull’s shadow
savoring every detail On its surface a rough layer of frost
Cold steam still drifts from it

GUILLEMOT
That’s frost
NEALY
Correct

GUILLEMOT
But I was told this was an explosion

NEALY
It was Big enough to wipe out three
city blocks

Guillemot studies the metallic surface

GUILLEMOT
What is this metal That’s not
titanium

NEALY

We were hoping you and your team could
help us with that

Guillemot considers the possibilities then --

GUILLEMOT
Does anyone else know

NEALY
My superiors My team And now yours

Suddenly the vessel GROANS It’s deep and reverberating

Every Soldier in the area trains their weapon on the vessel
ready to open fire

Nealy signals for everyone to hold She gestures for two
soldiers to flank the edges of the hull They scramble into
position

CRASH The massive trunk of a redwood tumbles aside hitting
the ground in a plume of dirt and leaves revealing

A door on the side of the vessel
CLOSE ON THE DOOR
as it slowly begins to open
DISSOLVE TO
EXT ALLEY - ANBAR PROVINCE - DAY

Urban scrawl Black smoke tumbles into the sky The light is
different Grainy and orange

As an M1Al ABRAMS TANK grinds into FRAME we hear Metallica’s
“RIDE THE LIGHTNING”

INT M1Al ABRAMS TANK - DAY

The music PULSES through an MP3 player The driver SETH WARD
30s clean-cut cocky and confident expertly guides them

through the alley

He taps the photo of his son

SETH

A terrified YOUNG SOLDIER wipes his lips on the verge of

vomiting

YOUNG SOLDIER

Suddenly the RADIO SPITS

(filtered)
We’re receiving heavy fire Unknown

Seth kicks into action Fun and games are over

SETH
(into radio)

The Young Soldier looks around panicking
YOUNG SOLDIER

YOUNG SOLDIER
It’s suicide This is suicide

SETH

SOLDIER 2
I can’t die here Not like this

EXT ALLEY - ANBAR PROVINCE - NIGHT
OVERHEAD ANGLE
A heavy FIRE-FIGHT between US MILITARY and INSURGENTS is

underway as Seth’s tank rumbles through the war-ravaged alley
beneath us
PULL BACK TO REVEAL

An INSURGENT is aiming a grenade-launcher at the incoming tank
It’s hooked up to video equipment The Insurgent looks to
another as he squares it up on video

INSURGENT 1
(in Iraqi)
Is it recording

INSURGENT 2

(in Iraqi)
We need bodies The more the better

INSURGENT CAMERA POV

As he records the tank passing in the alley beneath them CAMERA
ZOOMS in on the tank --

INT SETH’S TANK - DAY

KABOOM They’re hit from outside The concussion throws
everyone forward

YOUNG SOLDIER
Oh God Oh shit We’ve been hit

SETH

Seth checks a monitor finds the INSURGENT on the roof-top above
them

SETH
(into radio)
Three o’clock from our position
Ground to air rocket-launcher Read

Soldier 1 returns MACHINE GUN FIRE on the roof-top

YOUNG SOLDIER

The Young Soldier opens the roof hatch
SETH

Private close the hatch That’s an
order
EXT ROOF-TOPS - ANBAR PROVINCE - DAY

The INSURGENT takes the pin out of a grenade He sees the Young
Soldier climbing out below

He makes sure the other Insurgent is rolling video then tosses
the grenade down at the tank

INT M1A1 ABRAMS TANK - DAY
The Young Soldier is almost out now --

YOUNG SOLDIER
Have to get out

SOLDIER 1
Get your ass back in here

As Soldier 1 tries to pull him back inside the grenade lands
inside the tank

SOLDIER 2

Grenade
Sickening looks They’re all going to die
Seth doesn’t think He grabs some body armor hanging on the
back of a chair next to him and throws himself on top of the
grenade
CLOSE ON THE PICTURE
of Seth’s son Noah as -- KABOOM It’s disintegrated

CUT TO

INT MOTEL 6 - NIGHT

Seth bolts up into FRAME awakening from this post-traumatic
flashback

SUPER “EUREKA CALIFORNIA TODAY”

He’s trembling face mantled in sweat the shell of the man we
saw earlier His hair’s longer he has a ragged beard He’s
tired his eyes are troubled and squirrely He doesn’t trust
anyone or anything anymore

He grabs his left shoulder On it a long pulpy scar runs down
to his chest It’s a vivid reminder of the grenade blast
INT BATHROOM - NIGHT
The TV is on in the other room

TV (VO)
(filtered)

were taking Social Security away
from our children Were leaving them
with an impossible mountain of debt a
failing economy cutting funding for
education and lets not forget global
warming

Seth steps into FRAME wipes the steam away from the mirror He
stares at his own hollowed-out visage for a moment The
confidence and cockiness is gone It takes every ounce of will
for him to raise a razor and

Shave away his beard

EXT CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

A bulldozer ROARS through FRAME CONSTRUCTION WORKERS in hard-
hats work on a building

Seth walks with the construction boss OWEN 40s heavy-set
bearded and too busy for everyone

OWEN
I’m sorry Seth I got too many hands
already

SETH

Owen I’m not asking for my old job
I’ll take anything you have

OWEN

If I had something for you believe me
Id toss you a hat A lot’s happened
since you left buddy I gotta full
crew of assholes now I got assholes
up to here I got assholes coming
outta my ears

Seth knows when to leave it alone

SETH
Alright alright
OWEN
As soon as I have something you’re my

first call

Seth manages a stoic smile and walks away Owen feels bad
OWEN
Hey

Seth turns

OWEN
Welcome home buddy

INT DINER - LATER

Seth sits in a booth by himself with a cup of coffee He’s on
his cell as he finishes wrapping up a present

SETH

(into cell)
Seth Ward W-A-R-D We were best
friends We went to school together
He knows me

(listening)
Alright when he returns can you have
him call my cell Thanks

He hangs up catching some looks around the diner Their full
of curiosity pity People recognize him but no one has the
courage to approach him He’s a leper in his own hometown

SETH
Hey Jim

A father (JIM) in a nearby booth acknowledges with a quick
awkward smile and returns to his family

EXT UPSCALE SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
Nice houses Manicured lawns Doctors and Lawyers live here

A beat-up red Dodge truck pulls up into the driveway of a three-
story home

INT SETH’S TRUCK - DAY

Seth sits inside letting it idle as he gathers his courage He
pulls the wrapped present out of the backseat He checks it
Checks the ribbon Tightens it Making it perfect

SETH

(to himself)

You can do this

EXT ALI’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Seth approaches the front door with the present He holds his
head high He takes a deep breath and

KNOCKS

A beat Seth stands there at attention giving his best

The front door opens on --

ALI MILLER late 20s put together nicely too nicely trying to
get comfortable in a life she’s not comfortable in Behind her
her son NOAH now five

Seth stops breathing present in hand He’s utterly stunned at

the sight of them They watch Seth with the same amount of

shock and curiosity

SETH
Sorry I’m late

ALI
No youre early

She can’t take her eyes off of him Noah hides behind his
mother watching the stranger Seth grins down at him in
amazement

SETH
Hi Noah

He hands Noah the present The boy takes it tentative

NOAH
What is it

SETH
It’s a birthday present

NOAH
It’s not my birthday

SETH
I know I figured I’d start making up
for the ones I’ve missed

Noah studies the present trying to figure it out

ALI
You want to come inside

Seth looks up at the nice house awkwardly

SETH
I don’t know

ALI
Cmon I’1ll put some coffee on

INT KITCHEN - ALI’S HOUSE - DAY

PAN ACROSS PHOTOS of Ali and her fiance DAVID 40s a Polo-

nervously around the kitchen making coffee searching for non-
fat creamer in the fridge opening drawers for utensils

ALI

Quickly checking the box --

SETH

NOAH

ALI
As long as I don’t find any more pieces
in my vacuum

Noah takes it into the other room and begins to disassemble
everything on the floor

ALI
(calling after him)
I’m serious Noah

NOAH
Okay Mom

Ali sits on a stool across from Seth scoots him a cup of
coffee

SETH

Seth is stunned to hear this
ALI

SETH

Youve wanted to be a lawyer since we
were kids I just never thought I’d
hear this

ALI
Yeah well things change Life
changes Gotta roll with it right
(shrugging)
Greg thinks I should go back when
Noah’s a little older

Awkward silence Ali stirs her coffee cutting to the chase

ALI
So where did you go

Seth is taken aback by her bluntness

ALI
It’s been nine months We were worried
about you No one could find you You
just disappeared

SETH
You were worried

ALI
I’m just trying to fill in the blanks
Seth You left me with a lot of them
Seth glances down at her enormous engagement ring

SETH
You left me with a few yourself

ALI
Seth I know it’s hard for you to
believe but I care about you

Seth looks across at the photos of her fiance David

SETH
Are you happy

Ticking silence The tension in the air is palpable

ALI
We’re comfortable

SETH
Then that’s all that matters

Seth checks his watch glances across at Noah in the other room

SETH
We should probably get going huh

EXT DRIVEWAY - LATER

Seth and Ali come down the driveway Noah follows behind
trying to button his coat

SETH
I’ll have him back by five

ALI
Take your time

Seth opens the passenger’s side Noah climbs in

SETH
Does he need a car-seat

ALI
He outgrew it last year

She reaches over buckling Noah in

SETH
Is there anything else I should I know

ALI
Like is there a manual

SETH
Is there I couldn’t find it on-line

ALI
If you can drive a tank you can handle
a five year-old for one afternoon

INT SETH’S TRUCK - DAY

Seth drives Noah sits next to him in the passengers seat
staring at him like an alien Seth smiles across at Noah

SETH
So I hear you’re starting
kindergarten

NOAH
Yeah I’m five Charlie’s going to be

SETH
Charlie’s your friend

NOAH
She’s sort of mean to me She likes to
boss me around

SETH
Well you can’t let that happen

NOAH
Yes I can She’s bigger than me

Noah watches him grinning
NOAH
Mom says you got to drive a tank Was
it fun

Seth stares ahead awkwardly

SETH
I wouldn’t call it fun

NOAH
Did you kill a lot of bad guys

Seth turns on the radio Noah reaches over turning it down

Checkmate Seth smiles awkwardly it’s going to be a long
afternoon

As TWO HELICOPTERS BUZZ overhead vanishing over the tree-
line

CUT TO
EXT RANCH - DUSK

A fiery red sun sinks behind the trees Dust plumes as the
military convoy rolls through the entrance

EXT RANCH - DUSK

Guillemot and Nealy walk with a SOLDIER Tendrils of frosty air
rise around them The fence has been disintegrated from an
explosion The frozen corpses of dead livestock and birds
litter the field around them

ANOTHER ANGLE

A MILITARY DOCTOR checks an old Hispanic Woman (ILSA) on her
front porch She stares ahead almost catatonic

SOLDIER
She says there was a big explosion A
“machine” came out of it and took her
husband

NEALY
How many are missing now

SOLDIER
This makes four

Guillemot approaches the old woman who barely acknowledges his
presence

GUILLEMOT
Hi I’m Dr Guillemot Do you mind if
I ask you a few questions

The Old Woman doesn’t respond She just stares into the
distance

GUILLEMOT
We want to help you find your husband
Please can you describe this machine

ILSA
Gran maquina

She looks up at him eyes flooding with terror Guillemot
kneels at her level puts a consoling hand on her shoulder

GUILLEMOT
It’s okay Take your time Can
someone get her a glass of water

Anticipation is high as a soldier vanishes into the house
returns with some water Ilsa drinks it with both trembling
hands like she’s been in the desert for days

GUILLEMOT
Better Okay now

The Old Woman breathes deeply trying to keep it under control

GUILLEMOT
Did you see which direction it went

Ilsa mumbles something barely audible Guillemot gives her a
curious look

NEALY
What did she say

GUILLEMOT
She says it vanished in the light

EXT PARK - DAY
Seth watches Noah play on the jungle gym with several other
KIDS Seth isn’t sure what to do with himself He looks around
awkwardly out of his element He steals a glance at his watch
Feels bad for doing it
NOAH
(to kid)
That’s my Dad Over there He fought
in Iraq He killed a lot of bad guys

Seth realizes everyone on the playground has heard this He
avoids the incoming stares

EXT ICE-CREAM SHOP - DAY

CLOSE ON AN ICE-CREAM CONE

slowly melting in Seth’s hand

ANOTHER ANGLE

Seth and Noah sit on a park bench outside of an ice-cream store

NOAH
Dad Your ice-cream

Noah gestures to Seth’s ice-cream cone
He grins and

NOAH
You have to eat it before it melts

SETH
Oh is that how it works

take a bite for his son

NOAH

How long are you gonna stay
SETH

I don’t know
NOAH

Maybe you could help me build the Boba
Fett ship

SETH
Id love to

NOAH
David threw away my other Legos because
I left them on the floor

SETH
He did

NOAH
Mom says he’s just stressed

SETH
Well if he does that again let me
know

NOAH
Why Are you gonna kill him

SETH
(taken aback)
No Noah Nobody’s killing anybody
Killing bad guys is not something to be
proud of

NOAH
Why not

SETH
Because it’s not right to take another
life It doesn’t matter what they’ve
done

NOAH
But you could kill David if you wanted
to right

SETH
I think we need to change the subject
now

Noah smiles at his Dad thankful to have an ally

SETH
I’m glad you’re my Dad

Seth smiles back touched Not sure how to be a Dad Not sure
how to respond

Suddenly two TWO ARMY TRUCKS roll down the street DOZENS of
soldiers inside

Seth watches them alarmed

INT SETH’S TRUCK - LATER

Seth drives distracted as military helicopters THUNDER
overhead heading north over the tree-line He pulls out his

cell and dials Gets an answering machine He hangs up
thinking Turns on the radio flips through stations

NOAH
Why are we going home early

SETH
Noah not now

He reaches a station

RADIO STATION (VO)

(filtered)
the second explosion happened in a
rural area seven miles north of Eureka
California Air space over the site
has been restricted They’re warning
locals to keep clear of the area until
they can confirm it’s safety

He knits his brow seeing something up ahead --

A military blockade SOLDIERS divert traffic A NEWS VAN is
parked on the shoulder A local FEMALE REPORTER is trying to
get answers from a SOLDIER with her CAMERAMAN

Seth comes to a stop rolls down his window A SOLDIER quickly
approaches

SETH
What happened

SOLDIER
This road is off-limits

SETH
I have to get my son home

SOLDIER
I’m sorry sir you’re going to have to
take the detour

The Female Reporter and her Cameraman argue with another Soldier
across the street

FEMALE REPORTER
Why can’t you just answer the question
Was this explosion an attack or not

SOLDIER 2
I’m not authorized to answer any
questions right now Please keep
moving
As Seth pulls forward --
EXT DIRT ROAD - DUSK
Thick with giant redwoods Seth’s truck rumbles by
INT SETH’S TRUCK - DUSK

Seth drives frowning mind ticking away all the possibilities
Noah watches him

NOAH
This isn’t the way Mom takes me home

SETH
(distracted)
No it’s not It’s a detour

NOAH
What’s a detour

SETH
It’s another way home

NOAH
Are you mad at me

SETH
What No No of course not

NOAH

Then why are we going home early
SETH

Because because we are
NOAH

Because of the helicopters
SETH

(flustered)

I don’t know maybe It’s complicated
NOAH

Is that why we’re going the other way

home
SETH

I I can’t answer all of these
questions I need you to be quiet for
a little while I need to think okay

NOAH
What’s a detour
SETH
Noah -- stop Please Just stop

Noah blinks stunned at this outburst Now Seth feels even
worse

SETH
I didn’t mean to yell I’m sorry

Noah doesn’t answer
SETH
(to himself)

I’m not cut out for this

NOAH
Does this mean you’re going away again

Seth is silent At this point he doesn’t know
NOAH
It’s okay you can go I have another

dad

Seth glances across at him hurt He’s about to respond when
his eyes swell with horror

HIS POV
A BLINDING WHITE LIGHT EXPLODES THROUGH THE TREES
Followed by

KABOOM A concussion SHATTERS out all the windows in the truck
flipping it over like a small toy

ANOTHER ANGLE

CRASH CRASH CRASH Seth throws himself over his son
protecting him as the truck rolls over in a dizzying blur
Dirt leaves and twigs EXPLODE all around them

ANOTHER ANGLE

Metal GROANS as the truck rolls onto its roof

A blanket of frost billows over them as if someone just opened
the door to a very large freezer

Seth GROANS disoriented He’s upside down still holding Noah
tightly

SETH
Noah

Noah doesn’t move Seth shakes him harder

SETH
Noah

Noah stirs in his arms looks around scared

NOAH

SETH
It’s okay We’re okay

NOAH
We crashed the truck

He starts CRYING

NOAH
Dad we crashed the truck

SETH
No no -- hey Hey buddy we’re okay
Seth uses his free-hand to release his seat-belt

SETH
Look See We’re okay

He edges himself to the ground with Noah

There’s a loud CRACKING sound right outside of the truck and --
CRASH A gigantic frost-covered redwood falls next to them
shaking the ground sending a plume of leaves and branches
everywhere It missed them by a few yards

A beat Another loud CRACKING sound

Seth’s eyes widen They have to get out of here Now

NOAH
Dad

CRASH Another giant falls behind them This one is closer
Missing them by only a few feet

Noah cries harder

SETH
Shhhh Close your eyes

Noah closes his eyes Seth kicks out the rest of the broken
windshield

SETH
Alright Here

He removes his coat and wraps it around Noah protecting him
from the broken glass

SETH
Ready

Noah nods through his tears

SETH
Okay Here we go

EXT REDWOOD FOREST - DUSK
CLOSE ON SETH

grimacing with determination as he scoots out of the broken
windshield with his son

He looks up his face engulfed in spreading shadow His eyes
register a millisecond of panic before he rolls aside with Noah
and --

ANOTHER ANGLE

CRASH The earth trembles as a massive frost-covered tree
flattens the upturned truck folding its chassis in half like a
taco sending a tire hurtling off into space

CUT TO
EXT RANCH - NIGHT

The sun has gone down SCIENTISTS in biosafety suits are
everywhere taking samples and measurements Helicopters land
kicking up dust unloading more soldiers and scientists Ilsa
looks around confused guided to an awaiting helicopter

Where are you taking me

GUILLEMOT
Don’t worry You’ll be safe

Ma’am weve just received reports of
another event Four miles southwest of
your location

CUT TO
EXT FOREST - DUSK

Seth holds Noah crouching beneath the tiny space of a fallen
tree They’re both reeling from what has just happened

NOAH
(shivering)
It’s cold

Seth examines the tree they’re under It’s covered in a layer
of frost It’s just one of many that have tumbled to the ground
from the blast They’re all covered in frost pointing in the
same direction like a single spoke on a giant wagon-wheel

Weve seen this before
Noah begins to speak when Seth clamps his hand over his mouth

SETH
Shhh

An incandescent light appears behind them illuminating the
purple night as if it were noon

It’s followed by the WHIRRING of an engine (OS) WHOOSH
WHOOSH WHOOSH

The white light begins to turn colors running through the
spectrum The entire area becomes yellow orange red blue

Noah is trembling in Seth’s arms

NOAH
What is it

Seth just shakes his head overwhelmed
NOAH
(whispering)

I want to go home

Seth motions for silence He peeks out between the branches of
the fallen tree It’s coming closer

As the RUMBLING draws nearer they’re consumed by a large
shadow

Seth shields his eyes with an arm looking up at the dark
metallic underside of a vessel as it hovers over them It’s too
close to define its massive shape The lights are too bright to
see any detail

As it slowly glides past into the darkness

Seth breathes again He rifles through the pockets of his coat
now on Noah Finds his cell He tries to dial but

SETH
Shit

It’s dead
EXT NIGHT SKY - SAME TIME

One by one helicopters take off arcing into the night sky like
fireflies

CUT TO
EXT FOREST - NIGHT
It’s an eerie sight Clouds of frost drift everywhere as Seth
and Noah appear like ghosts They run through the forest
negotiating the wagon-wheel of fallen giants climbing over
branches sliding between trunks CRUNCHING through twigs and
leaves

Up ahead the road is covered with trees Seth looks around
flustered The destruction just goes on and on

NOAH
(gasping)
Dadtired feet hurt

SETH
Okay

He picks his son up puts him on his back

SETH
Better

Noah closes his eyes and nods resting his head on his father’s
back

SETH
We need to keep moving

As Seth piggy-backs him through the branches --

The RUMBLING returns behind them (OS) Seth turns lips parting
in terror

Dancing rays of light bounce through the web of branches behind
them strobing his features

NOAH
It’s coming back

The vessel is coming back their way

Seth charges forward with Noah blasting through the branches in
front of them
ANOTHER ANGLE
They make it across the road

NOAH
Hurry

Seth looks around surveying the area for a place to hide

HIS POV

On the other side of the road a darkened house

EXT DARKENED HOUSE - NIGHT

Seth carries Noah across the yard as the forest lights up behind
them growing brighter and brighter He sets Noah down tries

the door It’s locked Noah looks back

The outline of the giant vessel hovers over the trees It’s
still too bright to determine it’s shape

Noah stands there on the porch face scrunching up He starts
CRYING

NOAH
(nyperventilating)
Mom Mom Mom I want Mom

CRASH Seth throws his shoulder into the front door blasting
it open and --

INT LIVING ROOM - DARKENED HOUSE - NIGHT

Shifting shadows everywhere There’s nobody home Seth
stumbles in with Noah as the WHIRRING grows louder the lights
flaring through the window throwing their shadows against the
wall He closes the door behind them

SETH

He finds a land-line phone Picks it up to dial
Its dead No signal whatsoever

Seth frowns in confusion He searches for another phone
entering --

THE KITCHEN
where he finds one on the counter He picks it up Listens

SETH
Dead

NOAH
Dad it’s outside

As the RUMBLING grows louder Seth searches the counter Finds
a set of KEYS

He grabs Noah’s hand leading him back through --

with his free hand a bedroom a bathroom the garage

Bingo

INT GARAGE - NIGHT

Lights flare through the windows scattering rays everywhere
like a disco ball Seth and Noah enter to find a small Honda

Seth inserts the key into the ignition and turns

Nothing It doesn’t roll over at all He tries again and
again

SETH
Damnit

He slaps the steering-wheel in frustration

Noah sees something behind them His eyes saucer with horror

NOAH
(whispering)
Monster
SETH

Seth whirls around looking out the garage window

The silhouette of a hunched humanoid skirts past

It happens in the blink of an eye

Seth just stares not sure what he just saw

Seth moves through the garage summoning up the courage to look
out through the garage window

The yard is black Helicopter lights approach in the distance

SETH
exhales slowly relieved

WHOOSH The vessel lights up directly overhead blinding him
ANOTHER ANGLE

The Honda Civic CREAKS begins rolling back toward the garage
door pulled by an inexplicable force

NOAH

Seth runs to the rolling car struggles to reach inside for his
son

SETH
Grab my hand

The car RATTLES violently its tires lifting up off the
concrete

NOAH

Grab my hand C’mon

CLOSE ON HIS HAND
stretching for Noah’s fingertips touching them --

SETH (OS)
I gotcha --

WIDER

CRASH The Honda is sucked out of the garage door like lint in
a vacuum cleaner The force rockets Seth back into a wall of
shelves hard He’s buried under an avalanche of supplies

The remains of the garage door float and whirl weightlessly in
the air as the car spins up into the light

SETH’S POV

The world is blurry and getting blurrier

Like distorted images in fun-house mirrors hunched humanoids
shift and weave in our view back-lit by the brilliant

incandescence It’s too blurry to make out any more detail

They take us in a moment slowly converging One of them raises
its hand at us and

WHOOSH A colorful spectrum sprays out of it blinding us
Suddenly it switches off

The humanoid shapes turn their heads at the approaching
helicopter lights

CUT TO

Guillemot and Nealy lean forward peering through the window as
the vessel illuminates beneath them like a bottom-lit swimming
pool
NEALY
(into head-set)
I need video on this Someone better
be recording this

Suddenly the vessel makes a WHINING SOUND and --

WHOOSH The vessel sends out blinding concentric circles of
light

Everything goes dark The power goes out in the helicopter

GUILLEMOT
What’s happening

PILOT
Lost power

Guillemot looks out at the other helicopters They’re dark as
well dropping like flies They’ve all lost power

NEALY

The Pilot flips to auxiliary power It’s not working

PILOT
Brace yourselves

Guillemot and Nealy brace themselves Outside the window the
ground comes up to meet them We can see the illuminated vessel
in our periphery One second it’s there the next --

KABOOM The vessel vanishes in a white cloud leveling
everything around it It blows out all the windows of the
house collapsing the side facing it like matchsticks

Theyre about to hit the ground when --

The auxiliary kicks in Lights and instrumentation come back
on

The Pilot veers up at the last second bouncing and SKIDDING to
a stop in the yard

Everyone exchanges bewildered looks That was too close

GUILLEMOT
It’s gone

The vessel has vanished

EXT YARD - NIGHT

Helicopters land kicking up dust Nealy and Guillemot approach
the collapsed section of house in awe There’s a ragged layer

of frost leftover from the explosion

Ali paces frantically back and forth Her fiance DAVID 40s
is on the phone speaking slowly and deliberately almost like
Mr Rogers

DAVID
(into phone)
Yes that’s right Phenergan with
codeine Don’t take any alcohol with
that And prepare to be drowsy

Ali stares at him incredulous and impatient He catches the
look and gives her a helpless shrug She sighs exasperated

DAVID
(into phone)
If that doesn’t work I can refer you
to an ear nose and throat specialist

ALI
David --
David hangs up flustered
DAVID
What
ALI

Did it beep the background

DAVID
No --

She takes the phone and checks for herself No beep

ALI
I don’t get it He would’ve called by
now

DAVID
It’s only nine o’clock Maybe he
forgot

ALI

That’s not Seth He doesn’t forget
Not something like this

DAVID
Ali you need to calm down breathe
pour yourself a nice glass of wine and
breathe Here I’1l even do it for
you

Ali sits trying to stay calm as he pours her a glass of wine
Pours one for himself He smiles

DAVID
Everything’s going to be fine There’s
no reason to be worried right now --

WHOOSH TWO HELICOPTERS zoom overhead their xenon lights
bouncing across the neighborhood street

As they exchange disturbed looks --

through their masks Outside soldiers and scientists swarm the
house and yard

Why am I hand-cuffed Why are you
wearing those masks
GUILLEMOT
Hello I’m Dr Guillemot we need to
ask you a few questions

GUILLEMOT
Did your son have any medical

conditions Did he have any allergies

SETH
What

GUILLEMOT
Was he sick in the last year

SETH
(flustered)
I don’t know
GUILLEMOT
He was your son You must know

something
Insult to injury Seth doesn’t know anything about his son

SETH
What does that have to do with
anything

GUILLEMOT
Do you know your son’s blood type

Seth is losing it fast

SETH
Why are you asking me these questions
Do you know what these things are
Answer me What do you know that
youre not telling me

They stare back at him waiting Seth blows
SETH
My son is out there and he needs me I
can’t be here I have to find him Do
you understand I have to find him

Nealy exchanges a tacit look with Guillemot Without another
word they get up and quietly climb out of the helivac

SETH
Where are you going

Nealy confers with a Soldier who nods and shuts the door

SETH
Damnit

Seth thrashes in the gurney trying to get out of his cuffs

CITIZENS into the backs of trucks Both lanes in the road are
heading one direction out of town Everything else is blocked
off

We can’t see outside the tent We have no idea where we are
Outside the BUZZ of helicopters competes with HUMMING
generators (OS)
Like an emergency room the tent is partitioned with curtains

A MEDICAL STAFF moves from each one like astronauts FIND Seth
strapped down to a table as a Military Doctor draws his blood

Another Doctor monitors his EKG and EEG BLIPS on nearby
terminals

SETH
There’s nothing wrong with me

The Doctors don’t respond as they continue to work

SETH
I need to make a phone call I need to
call my son’s mom

The Doctors confer quietly ignoring him

SETH
Hey are you listening to me I don’t
have time for this I need to make a
call right now

The Medical Staff watches him through their Plexiglas face
shields their eyes betraying nothing

by an armed soldier His hand-cuffs are removed His blindfold
removed

He squints to see as the soldier leaves sealing the dome behind

Mike backs off irritated redirecting his frustration at the
Technicians on the other side of the dome

MIKE

GARY
Yes they can Who knows what we’re
infected with

SETH
We’re not infected

GARY
How do you know

SETH
Are you experiencing any symptoms

GARY
No but that doesn’t mean anything
Maybe it’s dormant or something

MIKE
Look dude this is basic cable
Theyre keeping us out of the
population because they don’t want us
telling the world what we saw

GARY
I didn’t see shit

MIKE

obscuring everything we want to see Through flapping curtains

is hostile It’s suicide

get my own family and friends to call
me back I’m tired of fighting I

one Seth It’s over --

A helicopter’s XENON LIGHT lights up the forest floor around
them

Hannah and Kyle hide beneath a fallen log

Seth pulls Ali into himself hiding beneath the cover of some
branches Her flashlight tumbles to the forest floor

HANNAH
(hissing)
Flashlight

CLOSE ON THE FLASHLIGHT

Its beam giving away their location

ANOTHER ANGLE

As the helicopter circles around again coming closer --

Seth leaps out grabbing it turning it off and rolling back
into place just as --

WHOOSH The searchlight hits the area he was just standing in
It hovers there a moment

KYLE
They know we’re here

Hannah signals for silence

The helicopter circles around one more time its searchlight
bouncing along the forest floor

It shines right on top of the branches protecting Seth and Ali
CLOSE ON SETH AND ALI

He’s holding her beneath the web of knotted branches They both
become self-conscious She wants to peel herself away from him
But she can’t The light is hovering right over them They
can’t move a muscle

ANOTHER ANGLE

As the searchlight moves away and the helicopter continues its
search

Ali yanks herself away from Seth then snatches her flashlight
out of his hand She puts some distance between them so angry
she can’t even look at him

Everyone comes out of hiding relieved at this close call

SETH
We better keep moving

As Nealy leaves Guillemot assesses the young Soldiers fearing
the worst

Seth leads the exhausted group through the trees They quickly
take cover as --

TWO MORE MILITARY HELICOPTERS fly overheard confirming they are
heading in the right direction

Kyle sits on a stump setting his camera down out of breath

KYLE

He pulls out a cigarette lights it
Everyone stops watching him cough and smoke

now-leaving couple and Kyle sitting on his ass with the
cigarette

HANNAH

Seth leads the group up the ridge careful to take cover in the
trees as passing helicopters ROAR overheard

He stops at the top eyes filling with recognition

SETH

Ali comes up behind him winded Her eyes grow big as she sees
what he sees

Hannah and Kyle pull up the rear Their jaws drop

HANNAH

Kyle raises his camera

KYLE
Yeah Yeah I’m seeing it

BENEATH THEM IN THE CLEARING

The brightly lit military command post The fallen redwoods
patterned like a wagon-wheel Tents are everywhere Scientists
and Technicians move around the area like astronauts At the
center of all the commotion

The Vessel

The tent has been removed Floodlights shine against its dark
metal surface Now for the first time we finally get a good
look at it

Its triangular in shape like a stealth bomber but the size of
a small ferry Its wings are serrated and bent under like
jagged fishhooks Its hull blunted like the head of a great
white shark

Ali is stammering too much energy too much information not
enough time to process

ALI
UFO spaceship What the hell is
that
SETH
I was trying to tell you
ALI
Yeah I know But what the hell is

that
They watch as a forklift loads several boxes of explosives
HANNAH

doing What are they loading there

The vessel’s door slowly closes

KYLE

SETH
That’s a bad idea

ALI

is

SETH

Maybe maybe not Even if they did do
you really think they’re going to tell
us

ALI

NEALY
(under his breath)
Here we go

EXT FOREST RIDGE - NIGHT

The group watches in speechless amazement as

The vessel rises over the tree-tops lighting the forest floor
beneath it It ascends even higher past their position on the
ridge even higher and then

stops and hovers in the darkness like a pulsing star

A beat

Ali unconsciously grabs Seth’s hand as the vessel hangs there in
this magic moment He notices conflicted with confusion and
happier memories Under different circumstances they would
have been perfect for each other

The vessel glows brighter pulsing over the tree-tops before
them

Another moment and then --

KABOOM It explodes in a ball of white light Shockwaves
ripple outwards through the darkness in concentric circles

Seth throws himself on top of Ali as a WALL OF DUST TWIGS AND
BRANCHES engulfs them

ANOTHER ANGLE
They sit up recovering in shock

As the light slowly dissipates we realize a layer of frost has
covered everything in the area

ALI
C-cold freezing

Seth recognizes the frost from before
Kyle uses his sleeve to wipe off his lens
KYLE
What just happened Somebody explain
what just happened because I’m really

starting to freak out right now

Suddenly the static clears on the MONITORS and we get fuzzy
images from the HELMET CAMS picking up the disoriented faces of
Reynolds and his team on the vessel It’s like someone just
dumped ice-water on them They look around themselves
trembling reeling One of them leans forward and vomits

shows a HELMET CAM looking out the window of the vessel
Through all the blur of movement we catch brief glimpses of the
world beyond

From what we can tell it’s night almost pitch black It’s
barren and windswept Visibility is almost non-existent like
we’re on the bottom of the ocean

Powerful GUSTS HOWL and SHRIEK rocking the vessel back and
forth as it begins moving forward

outside Through the wind and sheets of sand we make out a
dark shape

As we get closer we realize it’s a structure of weathered
metallic domes connected by tubes They’re barely visible in

He looks around himself thinking

His gaze settling on a nearby Technician in a biosafety suit
He’s taking a soil sample from the area

EXT MILITARY COMMAND POST - MOMENTS LATER

Seth is now wearing that Technician’s biosafety suit He moves
through the camp passing similarly dressed soldiers and
scientists all preoccupied with their work

As he approaches a central cluster of tents --

approaching Scientist trapped

He slips into the nearest tent and --
INT TENT - NIGHT

Dimly-lit Seth enters letting his eyes adjust to the
darkness As they do his lips part in awe He’s unable to
wrap his mind around what he’s looking at

BEFORE HIM

Two tables with two autopsied corpses

Their bodies are long and white albino white Tiny black eyes
stare lifelessly from wide swollen faces Their skin is
marbled with grotesque lesions Their mouths agape showing
razor sharp teeth Their arms and legs still wear titanium
exoskeletal armor It’s been cut off of their torsos which are
clamped open for the autopsy

An exhausted DOCTOR looks up from his terminal as he inputs
data He’s wired from being up all night

DOCTOR
Can I help you

Seth glances back outside Everyone is gathering searching for
him right now Seth has to think of something fast

SETH
Dr Guillemot sent me here for the test
results

The Doctor gives him a quizzical look And then

DOCTOR
The results for the blood tests were
sent over an hour ago How many times
do I have to tell him They expired
from a blood-borne disease

“Your Dad’s eating breakfast right now
He’s having bacon and eggs and orange
juice just like us”

Ali smiles at the memory She’s unconsciously twisting Greg’s
engagement ring on her finger

When I put him to bed at night “He’s
reading Cat in the Hat Just like us”

It made him feel good It made me feel
good In those moments you were with
us And then we didn’t hear from you
anymore I started thinking this is
it Here comes that call The
doorbell’s going to ring and they’re
going to be standing there to deliver
the news The worst part about it all
was telling him Because after that
we couldn’t have bacon and eggs and
orange juice with you anymore We
couldnt read bed-time stories

I thought I was fighting for our
future

WHOOSH Beams spray out of the vessel like rays from a disco
ball But they don’t destroy Seth they dance over him
assessing him studying him
Seth looks back at Ali in the distance
CLOSE ON ALI

She shakes her head ‘no’ terrified

ALI
No

CLOSE ON SETH

He musters the courage to smile It’s sad and full of regret
KABOOM He vanishes in cloud of white light

CLOSE ON ALI

Concentric circles of white light spread across the command
post covering it in frost

As the light dissipates she looks back where Seth was
The Vessel is gone And Seth with it

DISSOLVE TO
INT HOLDING ROOM

Very dim light Metallic walls Like the inside of a
submarine A long window on the far wall shows the alien
windswept world outside Jagged rocks compete with shifting
dunes There is no sun moon or stars It’s just a sheet of
pitch black

Seth stirs on the floor His arms are wrapped in a transparent
viscous material From the puncture wounds we can tell blood
has been taken from him recently He touches the material It
seems to move and shift around his finger as if it’s alive

A VOICE (OS)
I’ve dreamed of this moment my entire
life Since I was a child

Seth squints in the shadows to find

Guillemot curled in a ball on the floor burns covering most of
his body He COUGHS weakly About a dozen other wounded
SOLDIERS are scattered around the room

GUILLEMOT
Intelligent life other than our own

He laughs bitterly to himself

GUILLEMOT
Instead of looking up at the skies we
should have been looking at our own
children

SETH

You’re not making any sense
GUILLEMOT

Theyre dying Our children our

dying
Guillemot coughs quietly and is silent
Seth shakes him

SETH
Hey HEY What’s going on here Talk
to me Where are we

The man’s eyes stare up at the ceiling glazed and lifeless
It’s too late Guillemot is gone

Seth looks at the other captured soldiers and technicians
strewn along the wall We recognize a few of them from the
first mission Others were taken in the attack

SETH
(scared)
Where are we

MANS VOICE (OS)
Not where are we

We recognize the pilot from the first mission REYNOLDS as he
surfaces from the shadows eyes sharp with anger and revenge
There’s a large burn running from his right eye to the base of
his neck

REYNOLDS
When are we

Seth watches Reynolds confused
REYNOLDS
C’mon you don’t know Where did you
think we were Another planet

Seth looks outside at the alien wasteland at a loss

REYNOLDS
Welcome to our future Not so bright
is it

SETH
Our future

REYNOLDS

Take a good look outside That’s the

Redwood forest Beautiful isn’t it
(checking his watch)

And look it’s not even 10 am

Seth stares out at the pitch black world of windswept rock

REYNOLDS

That’s right No sun Ever
SETH

I saw the aliens with my own eyes
REYNOLDS

Theyre not aliens

(beat)

Theyre us

SETH

They don’t look human

REYNOLDS
We don’t look too much like
Neanderthals either

SETH
That was forty thousand years of years
of evolution

REYNOLDS
We don’t know how far in the future we
are Could be a couple hundred years
Could be a couple thousand However
long it was this environment changed
them It molded them

He points outside at the wasteland

REYNOLDS
We shit on it and it shits right back
on us Ain’t karma grand

Suddenly there’s a loud CLANKING in the corridor beyond

REYNOLDS
Roaches are coming Guess you passed
your blood test AB right

He gestures to the viscous material on Seth’s arms

REYNOLDS
AB is gold to them They’re coming to
cocoon you

Reynolds slowly vanishes in the shadows as he retreats to his
spot on the wall

Seth backs away as the door slides open and two humanoids in
metallic exoskeletal armor appear Their latticed armor gives
them a hunched appearance like roaches Its hard to make out
any other details in the darkness but their lithe albino-white
bodies which seem almost too weak to support the power armor

They shine a light through the room it bounces off the
soldiers along the wall all appearing to be sleeping
landing on Seth who keeps his eyes closed

One of them approaches his still form shining the light on the
strange viscous material on his arms It reaches down grabbing
Seth’s legs It begins to drag him out of the room when --

The other one utters a GUTTURAL noise It’s standing over
Guillemot’s corpse

The humanoid drops Seth and helps the other one pull Guillemot’s
body out of the room As the door slides shut behind them --

Reynolds is up

REYNOLDS
Alright who’s still with us

A half dozen people in the room signal that they are
REYNOLDS
Alright this is gonna happen fast So
everybody keep up

SETH
What are we doing

REYNOLDS
What we came here to do in the first
place Excuse me

Reynolds moves to the door stares out in the corridor beyond

SETH
Somebody wanna talk to me here

REYNOLDS
Hey buddy school’s out You’re either
onboard or youre not

SETH
Onboard with what

REYNOLDS
Somebody wanna help me with this guy

Another soldier YOUNG appears behind them

YOUNG
We’re shutting the door

SETH
What’s that mean

YOUNG

You know how we got here right

(off Seth’s lost look)
You know about wormholes and shit
Yeah well we’re linked by one
There’s one connecting our present with
theirs Somehow they discovered it and
exploited it with their technology
Were closing the door here so they
can’t come back there Got it

SETH
You have no intention of going back
YOUNG
No
SETH
My son’s here
REYNOLDS
That’s too bad This isn’t a rescue
mission
SETH

What’s to stop them from going back
further in time

YOUNG
It’s not like that This wormhole is
specific On one end is our present
on the other is theirs The path is
set you know like train tracks

Reynolds sees something in the corridor beyond

REYNOLDS
(hissing)
Here we go Everybody get ready

The soldiers slide against the wall Seth moves with them The
metallic CLANKING of exoskeletal armor draws nearer

REYNOLDS
(whispering)
Alright remember the plan

Nods from the survivors

REYNOLDS
They got our ship about two hundred
paces west of here We take out
everything between here and there we
take it back and we ram that fucker
into the crystal

SETH
What crystal

REYNOLDS
The one that’s powering this place

SETH
How do you know where it is

REYNOLDS
Because they told us

Reynolds scoots past him Young catches Seth’s lost look
YOUNG
We had a little “Q and A” with a couple

of them before we came over

REYNOLDS
“Q and A” I like that Young

The CLANKING comes closer stopping outside of the room

REYNOLDS
(whispering to Seth)
Let us handle this

ANOTHER ANGLE

The door opens and a single humanoid enters shining its light

down on Seth’s inert form He leans down over Seth Something
resembling a hypodermic needle juts out of the armor around its
hand

CLOSE ON THE NEEDLE

Slowing descending toward Seth’s neck About to puncture his
skin when --

REYNOLDS (OS)
Now

ANOTHER ANGLE
Reynolds Young and the other Soldiers jump on top of it

CRASH CRASH CRASH The humanoid spins around like a
mechanical bull SMASHING them all into the wall But Reynolds
is a pitbull He lunges his hand through the latticed neck of
the suit grabbing the creatures frail white neck He SNARLS
vicing down hard

REYNOLDS
Choke on this you sonuvabitch
The humanoid chokes unable to breath and then collapses into
a heap

Reynolds stands wiping his hand off on his pants in disgust

He circles around the dead humanoid finding its right arm
Attached to the metallic exoskeletal arm is a cylindrical
handheld weapon

CRACK CRACK CRACK He slams the heel of his boot into the
creature’s elbow again and again breaking it off at the joint
He removes the severed arm inside like crab-meat and slides his
own hand into the exoskeletal armor examining it

He points it down at the body and --

WHOOSH He shoots a beam into its back searing a smoking hole
in its flesh

REYNOLDS
Let’s roll

INT CORRIDOR - STRUCTURE

FOLLOW Seth struggling to keep up with Reynolds and the other
soldiers as they navigate a dimly-lit labyrinth of corridors

Its ceilings are high Its walls sparse and utilitarian Its
floors are steel grating This is survival at its grimmest

SOLDIER 1
(disgusted)
God what’s that smell

SOLDIER 2
I don’t wanna know

YOUNG
The moisture’s insane in here You
guys feel that

REYNOLDS
Keep it down

They reach a crossroads

REYNOLDS
Left Keep moving

They take the left tunnel hurrying forward feeding off of each
others adrenaline

Suddenly two humanoids in armor appear Reynolds BLASTS the
first one dropping it before it knew what hit it

The other fires back hitting a young soldier (ADKINS) He
SCREAMS the beam burning a hole right through his thigh

Reynolds FIRES again hitting the last humanoid It hits the
ground tries to crawl away and Reynolds fires again this
time in the head Killing it

Two soldiers go to work on the smoking corpses breaking off the
arms at the elbows to use as weapons

Reynolds looks down at Adkins’ leg wound He’s just going to
slow them all down

REYNOLDS
Looks pretty bad

ADKINS
Yeah

REYNOLDS

You did good You should be proud

ADKINS
(wincing)
Yeah thanks

REYNOLDS
(to everyone else)
Let’s go

Seth stares after Reynolds at his cold-bloodedness He doesn’t
want to be a part of this

Reynolds glances back sees that Seth hasn’t moved

REYNOLDS
You coming

SETH
Youre just going to leave him

REYNOLDS
He’s gonna slow us down

SETH
I’m not leaving him

REYNOLDS
Guess it doesn’t really matter Ina
few minutes we’ll all be in the same
place anyway

With that Reynolds leads his men around the corner and
vanishes

Seth rips his shirt makes a tourniquet for the young soldier

ADKINS
It’s burning bad Hurts like hell

SETH
I’m sorry I’m gonna try to stop the
bleeding here

Adkins watches Seth work He winces in pain

ADKINS
You’ve done this before

SETH
A few times

Adkins watches him another moment deliberating

ADKINS
You said you got a son here

SETH
Yeah

ADKINS
I -- I think I might know where he is

INT ANOTHER CORRIDOR

Reynolds leads the charge dropping another humanoid A SHRILL
ALARM fills the corridors

They come around the corner to find --

A massive docking bay filled with vessels It’s like a great
cathedral Ceilings stretch beyond visibility Multi-colored
glowing crystals adorn its walls pulsing together like one
collective heart-beat

PAN ACROSS THE VESSELS to find one crippled and scored from
heavy fire It’s the one Reynolds piloted in earlier

INT CORRIDOR - STRUCTURE

Seth holds Adkins up guiding him down the corridor The ALARM
can be heard in the distance Seth moves Adkins into the
shadows as two humanoids race past heading towards the
commotion caused by Reynold’s crew

ADKINS
Right up here

SETH
How do you know all this

ADKINS
Each of us had to memorize the blue-
prints of the facility as part of our
preparation The roaches were very
“forthcoming” during the interrogation

SETH
We tortured them

ADKINS
That’s a nicer way of putting it They
told us everything we wanted to know
How to operate the vessel The lay-out
of the place Everything short of
their mother’s maiden name

SETH
You said you can fly one of these
ships

ADKINS
Yeah We all can
(pointing)

Left up here
As they take the left passage --
INT DOCKING BAY - STRUCTURE
A FIRE-FIGHT is underway Reynold’s crew is slowly gaining
ground on their vessel They’re severely outnumbered but
fighting viciously hitting below the belt

They take cover beneath the hull of the vessel grabbing weapons
from fallen corpses which continue to fuel their fight

INT CORRIDOR - STRUCTURE

Seth and Adkins come around the corner reaching a nondescript
metal door with no handle on it

ADKINS
This is it

SETH
How does it open

Adkins puts his hand on it closes his eyes concentrating
A beat
ADKINS
Sorry gotta clear my mind lLeg’s
killing me
He closes his eyes again exhales slowly and
The door slides open Seth stares back at Adkins amazed
ADKINS
Most of their technology is thought-
based It’s very intuitive
INT MEDICAL FACILITY - STRUCTURE - NIGHT
The ALARM continues in the corridor behind them as they enter
bewildered The room is lit with a spectrum of crystals like
the navigation table only they’re all over the walls floor and

ceiling Pulsing strobing

A humanoid looks up from its post Its a smaller female
Terrified she utters something GUTTURAL

Seth raises his hands meaning no harm

SETH
We’re not going to hurt you

The humanoid backs against the wall sliding along it to the
door where she quickly flees

ADKINS
We better hurry

Seth steps forward his eyes adjusting to the darkness He’s
not sure how to process what’s in front of them

SETH
Oh my God

REVERSE ANGLE

Cocoons float weightlessly in the middle of an enormous room
Only they’re not cocoons they’re bodies covered in a
transparent cellophane-type material It’s organic
gelatinous like a thin layer of skin Just like the stuff on
Seth’s arms

ANOTHER ANGLE
Seth reaches a floating cocoon Inside the transparent skin

the distorted features of an OLD HISPANIC MAN (Ilsa’s husband)
arms crossing his chest like a mummy

Seth touches him gently His cocoon drifts weightlessly in the
other direction

SETH
Why are they like this

ADKINS
These are the AB’s They’re being
preserved until they find a cure

As Seth moves forward earnestly searching the floating
cocoons

ADKINS
This disease is making them extinct
Why do you think they have to wear
these exoskeletons They’re so weak
their bones can’t support their own
weight Without this support theyd
collapse like jello

Seth stops He finds a smaller cocoon gently orbiting the far
perimeter of the room

SETH
(whispering)
Noah
It’s Noah
The boy’s arms are crossed across his chest His eyes are
closed The viscous cellophane material pressing against his
skin distorting his peaceful features

Seth grabs his son’s floating form gently pulling him down to
the ground He tears the transparent skin off of Noah

A beat Nothing happens Noah is not breathing

SETH
Noah

Another agonizing moment Seth shakes him hard

SETH
Noah

The boy GASPS suddenly sucking at air His eyes snap open
searching for a point of reference

SETH
(quietly)
Hey buddy
NOAH
Dad
SETH

It’s okay I’m here

Noah’s huge eyes take in the room the floating bodies He
panics hyperventilating

SETH
Where am I --

SETH
Calm down it’s okay

Seth embraces the boy hugging him tightly

SETH
We’re going home
(to Adkins)
Help me take them down

You okay

Noah gives him a feeble nod

master pianist

corridor

They turn left then right heading down different dark

They arrive at the docking bay as --

KABOOM Reynolds’ vessel blasts its way out of the bay letting
in hurricane force winds Humanoids raise their arms to shield
their eyes as a wall of sand spirals through the bay

INT DOCKING BAY

The wind is DEAFENING in here Sand swirls everywhere
decreasing visibility Using the sudden pandemonium to their

advantage Seth carries his son following Adkins to an awaiting
vessel The remaining victims are right behind him
NOAH

SETH
It’s just a bad dream buddy Now
close your eyes Can you do that

Noah nods Seth shields Noah with his body head down pushing
through hurricane force winds

ANOTHER ANGLE
They reach the door to the vessel and enter one by one as --
INT VESSEL - NIGHT

Seth carries his son into the vessel leading the other victims
inside

ADKINS
Strap yourselves in We’re leaving

As the door closes behind them everyone finds a seat around the
table full of crystals They climb into their harnesses

ADKINS
Let’s hope the Collapse Drives are
still functional

SETH
Collapse Drives

ADKINS
You know how black holes are formed
right

SETH
Collapsing stars

ADKINS
Dark matter Ninety percent of the
fabric of this universe This vessel
has the capacity to harness that
energy

Seth gives him an overwhelmed look

SETH
That’s playing with fire

ADKINS
That’s what it takes to enter a worm-
hole
SETH
How do you operate it

ADKINS
You don’t

Adkins quietly extends his hands like a grand pianist letting
them hover over the crystals One by one they light up As
they do the lights in the cabin turn a soft amber hue

ADKINS
It operates you

He stands watching Seth’s baffled expression
ADKINS
You think and it responds It’s like
mediation or prayer You just release
everything and have faith Everybody
ready
Seth double-checks Noah’s harness

SETH
Comfortable

Noah nods scared Seth comforts him with a smile only a Dad
could give

SETH
Almost home buddy

YOUNG
We should be coming up on it right now

As he says this they come upon

A single pulsing crystal the size of an apartment building It
floats above the ground changing colors touching nothing
REYNOLDS
Time to seal the deal
