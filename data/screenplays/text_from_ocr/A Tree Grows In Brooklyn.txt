A Tree Grows in Brooklyn

A short montage of current newspaper headlines fades in

INVASION JITTERS

simple as that but infinitely deep
For that single moment I could not
understand why it should take me

back to Brooklyn
In the end that is the

anything finer than the beginning
of a Saturday in Brooklyn

the headlines dissolve first to the Williamsburg

and then back through views of modern Brooklyn into

We see horse-drawn
beer trucks

the swinging doors of a saloon

a street

sweeper bedding piled on fire escapes a wooden cigar-store
Indian the tree near the Nolan tenement and finally the

Nolan

This dissolves to the NOLAN KITCHEN

street and tenement

It is early Saturday

morning Katie and Francie are finishing cleaning up the

breakfast dishes

Neeley is struggling in from the hall with

Katies scrubbing pail and cloths and mop He sets them down
inside the door

KATIE
stil

attractive
pay much attention to herself

the mother of the family is in her early thirties
young enough to be quick and alive to life She is

but is always so busy that she never has time to
The flat is a small one on

the second floor back sparsely furnished but its
spotlessness reflects Katies passion for cleanliness

FRANCIE her daughter is about thirteen She is a rather

quiet

child She has inherited from Johnny

her father a

sensitiveness and an imagination that make her by far the
more difficult problem in parenthood for the Nolans

NEELEY is a year younger

healthy boy He is much more Katies child
was born with something of both of them

NEELEY
(setting down
the bucket)
Is that all mom can we go now

KATIE
Not so loud Neeley you want to
wake papa

NEELEY
(much quieter
to Francie)
Gosh aint you through with them
ole dishes yet

KATIE
Shell only be a minute My I wish
you was as anxious to get going on
a school morning as on a Saturday

FRANCIE
(wiping the dishes)
Papa was late last night

KATIE
I was dead asleep when he come in
I guess

FRANCIE
He says if people didnt like to

and is completely a normal

while Francie
make speeches so much at dinners
waiters could spend more time with
their families

KATIE
Wasnt much of a job I guess Them
club dinners dont tip much

FRANCIE
(finishing)
Is that all mama

KATIE

Yes yes go on and Ill do the
rest

(she indicates the

sack Neeley has

dragged out)
Dont look like you got much in
there this week

NEELEY
One of these days Mrs Gaddis is
goin to throw away that ole wash
boiler of hers Carney will pay us
plenty for the copper bottom off of
that

KATIE
He wont pay you any more than he
has to You watch him on the
weighin

NEELEY
(in a hurry)
Yesm Good-bye mom

KATIE
Parents ought to have a day thats
like Saturday for kids Maybe if I
start in the lower hall and scrub
my way up today itll make somethin
special out of it Keep an eye on
him now Francie

FRANCIE
Yes mama

NEELEY
Aw come on

Their exit has been a scramble of getting their coats on
and hardly being able to wait to get outdoors When the door
slams behind them Katie looks after them a second with a
little smile half-envious of their childhood Then she
starts to get her implements together to begin her days
work as janitress and the scene dissolves to Francie and
Neeley pulling their sack of junk along the crowded street
The street is alive and vital with activity but Francie and
Neeley pay no attention to it

NEELEY

Well he was silly to stay down
there that long Idve kicked and
kicked that ole whales stomach good
so hed have got sick right off I
wouldnt have waited like Jonah did

(to a passing boy)
Hi Snozzy

SNOZZY
(matter-of-factly)
Hi yourself and see how you like it

This brief exchange of courtesy is quite routine Neeley
stops suddenly as he sees something about to happen down
the street

NEELEY
There she comes

From their angle we see a big garbage wagon swing around a
corner Four boys are waiting matter-of-factly and just as
the wagon swings around the corner they throw a chunk of
wood under its rear wheels It makes the truck take quite a
bump and shakes off some of its cargo The boys are on
this like a shot to redeem anything of value The driver
yells back at them and they shriek answering derision

CHORUS OF BOYS
Aw go chase your self Its a free
country aint it Stick in the mud
and sos your ma Its a free
country

One of the boys shies a can at the driver The wagon goes on
and the brief exchange is over Neeley and Francie make no
effort to horn in on the other kids beat but watch with a
detached interest

NEELEY
They done good today

Neeley and Francie start on down the street At that moment
a man passes takes the last cigarette out of a package and
throws the empty package into the gutter Francie and Neeley
dive for it So does another boy The Nolan teamwork shows
long practice Francie dives onto the other boy and they go
down together while Neeley retrieves the package The boy
scrambles up ready for battle but thinks better of it when
he sees there are two of them

BOY
(saving his dignity)
Aw vag pickers Rag pickers

He beats it Francie picks up the junk sack Neeley
separates the tinfoil from the paper Neeley then becomes
fascinated as he drops the paper through the grating into
the sewer

NEELEY
You know somethin I bet she goes
clear down to the river

FRANCIE
(joining him)
Maybe clear to the ocean -- maybe
clear over to foreign climes
(Neeley lust gives
her a Youre nuts
look and she adds
matter-of-factly)
It stinks awful dont it

NEELEY
Yeah

FRANCIE
I bet thats the worst stink in the
whole world dont you

NEELEY
I dont know I cant remember
everything I smell

They pick up their sack and move on the view moving with
them

NEELEY
You know what Im goin to get a
job cleanin up over to the fights
Skinnys cousins doin that and
youd ought to see alla stuff he
finds -- joolry and pocketbooks and
alla candy he can eat

FRANCIE
Thou talkest very big

NEELEY
You talk crazy

FRANCIE
I do not I talk like God talks

NEELEY
How do you know how God talks

FRANCIE
Well its in the Bible and I guess
its His Bible isnt it and so
thats the way He talks

NEELEY
Aw you talk crazy

Neeley changes the subject rather than admit defeat They
have reached an old stable which carries the sign CARNEYS
GOOD PRICES FOR JUNK Beyond them inside the old barn
CARNEY can be seen weighing out the junk that some of the
children have brought in Neeley stops Francie and addresses
her with male authority

NEELEY
Now look stand on the same side as
him when he weighs it sos he can
reach you and dont forget to stand
there after he pays you you forgot
that last time and a pennys a
penny aint it

FRANCIE
Well I guess I know it is

NEELEY
(triumphantly)
Well all right then

As Francie starts dragging the sack inside a boy who has
sold his junk comes out past them Rag pickers rag
pickers he jeers But Neeley passes this insult being
more interested in watching Francie

Francie drags the sack in and gets next in line Carney is
paying off the kid who preceded her counting pennies into
his hand

KID
(starting to protest)
Look--

CARNEY
(interrupting)
Shut your trap I say what things
weigh around here Whos next

The kid subsides and goes out Francie moves up
CARNEY
(seeing her)
Oh hello little girl
Francie gives him a mechanical smile in answer His manner
is somehow different with girls He dumps out the contents

of the junk sack starts to sort and weigh them

Francie shoots a look at Neeley He motions her to edge
closer And as she obeys Carney finishes the weighing

CARNEY
You done pretty good Nine cents

He counts the pennies into her hand Francie stays there
Carney chuckles a little and reaches out and pinches her
cheek Having done this he brings forth another penny
Francies hand is out immediately -- Neeley is well-
satisfied

CARNEY
And there you are an extra penny
because youre a nice little girl

The very matter-of-factness of all this is somehow worse
than if it were an ordeal to Francie The moment she has the
penny she runs out and joins Neeley His manner is
approving

NEELEY
Thats better Gosh I wisht Carney
liked to pinch boys

FRANCIE
Nine and my pinchin penny Thats
five for us and five for the bank

NEELEY
Now wait a minute The pinchin
penny dont count its yours by
rights

FRANCIE
Well I dont know Neeley if you
got somethin it counts dont it

NEELEY
Sure it dont Look half what we
get for the junk is for the bank
thats what mama says aint it

FRANCIE
Well yes but--

NEELEY

Well we didnt get that penny for
junk we got it for pinchin so
its yours so there aint use in
talkin any more about it

FRANCIE

Well--

NEELEY
Anyway that leaves nine dont it
and now you tell me how were goin
to divide nine in half go ahead

FRANCIE
Well we could put--

NEELEY
You cant do it not without
splittin a penny in two and then
it wouldnt be any good So we got
an extra penny and by rights its
mine cause you already got one

FRANCIE
But Neeley mama said--

NEELEY
All right wisenheimer you show me
how to split a penny

FRANCIE
Well I guess-- Well maybe the next
time it dont come even the bank
gets it--

NEELEY

Sure aint that just what I been
sayin And that leaves eight --
two more for me two for you and
four for the bank

(Francie divides

the pennies)
You see it comes out just right I
dont see why you got to be so dumb

He leads the way as they start on down the street while
other children come up with some junk

FRANCIE AND NEELEY
(as scornfully as
they were yelled at)
Rag pickers Rag pickers

As they go on down the street the scene dissolves to the

exterior of CHEAP CHARLIES a neighborhood store one of
the places where the boys hang out -- Francie and Neeley
come down the street kicking a little block of wood down
the sidewalk and trying to keep it on the sidewalk The

game automatically ceases as they come to the door of the
shop

NEELEY
Now wait a minute Dont go in like
you was with me

FRANCIE
Well hurry up then
Neeley swaggers in and in a moment Francie follows him into
CHEAP CHARLIES Neeley joins some boys before a form of
punchboard the prizes hung on the wall -- a few good ones
-- a catchers mitt a pair of roller skates a doll This
is the sort of place that is the forerunner to the poolhall
where the boys will hang out when they are older One of
the boys puffs a cigarette self-consciously -- Francie
lingers near the cash register -- One of the boys has just
taken a chance on the board and is opening the envelope

CLAMOR OF VOICES
Fourteen A pencil Its a gip
Looka the sucker thinks he can win
somepn Gimme a drag Red Get
away I got dibs on butts

Neeley dives for the board immediately and pulls a number

NEELEY
Twenty-six
(he looks at the board)
A penwiper

CHEAP CHARLIE
Prize or candy mister

NEELEY
Candy -- a lickorish whip

Charlie hands him one which Neeley wraps around his wrist
Charlie starts toward the register to wait on Francie but
keeps an eye on the boys

BOYS
Its a gip Aw there aint no
numbers for them good prizes

CHEAP CHARLIE
(as he passes them)
All of lifes a gamble gentlemen
you never win if you dont keep on
takin chances
(coming to Francie)
Whats yours young lady

FRANCIE
(counting out five
pennies onto the
counter)
Change to a nickel please

CHEAP CHARLIE
Well Ill get fat on that kind of
business

But he grudgingly takes the pennies and gives her a nickel
from the cash register She slips out without answering and
Cheap Charlie looks after her a second before he starts back
to the boys

Francie hurries down the street A group of girls are
playing pottsie -- a form of hopscotch -- on some marked-out
squares on the sidewalk Francie has to pass near them

GIRLS
Hi Francie How much did you get
Want to play Francie

FRANCIE
(hurrying past them)
I cant Im in a hurry

This dissolves to a FIVE AND TEN CENT STORE where Francie
is seen wandering languidly down an aisle She is in the
midst of the beauty of the world Her longing to be here is
not at all the desire for acquisition there is nothing
wistful or envious about her Being here is complete
fulfillment She pauses a time or two to look at or touch
something as if she were in fairyland -- A floorwalker
observes her curiously -- Unaware of him she continues
to look her way down the counter She is fascinated by a
pile of colored bathing caps and picks one up tentatively
A salesgirl steps up and Francie puts it down quickly --
The floorwalker steps up to her

FLOORWALKER
Do you want something young lady

FRANCIE
(with great dignity
opening her hand to
display the nickel)
Im merely looking thank you I got
a right I got money

Her confidence that the money justifies her being there is
complete She goes on her way Her attitude rather than the
nickel defeats the floorwalker He looks after her as she
stops again to look at something and then moves on
unhurriedly to the door

Francie emerges from the store replete with the fulfillment
of the adventure She gives a deep and happy sigh then
starts down the street She has only gone a few feet when a
fragrance strikes across her dream world and penetrates to
her healthy childs stomach The stomach wins hands down
over the dream Her manner changes completely as she turns
to the window and sees the candy She looks at it fora
moment and goes in

Inside the CANDY STORE Francie presses close to the case to
make her important choice The proprietor comes up

FRANCIE
(deciding)
Three cents worth of peppermint
drops please

The proprietor isnt particularly pleased by the magnitude
of the sale but reaches for a sack as the scene dissolves
to the STREET The bag of candy in one hand her mouth full
of peppermint Francie is absorbedly trying to avoid
stepping on the cracks in the sidewalk

FRANCIE
(to herself)
Step on a crack break your
mothers back

She pauses to readjust the peppermint drop in her mouth
You dont chew these and if you suck them just right they
last longer In the midst of this process of careful
adjustment she hears the shrill yelling of some boys and
looking off she sees a CAR TRACK where Neeley and a gang of
boys are putting a tin can on the track so that the

streetcar will smash it -- Francie comes into the scene and
watches
BOYS
(seeing the car
approaching)

Here she comes Cheese it

They tear to the sidewalk -- The streetcar rolls over the
tin can without a tremor -- The boys emerge cautiously as
though they had done something very daring

BOYS
That ole cans mashed good and flat
Boy did you see the look on that
motormans face That ole car came
near jumpin the track I bet

They retrieve the can and study it

FRANCIE
(from the sidewalk
Neeley we got to go home

The boys turn They are aware of her for the first time
Neeley is in a spot in being told what to do by a mere
girl

NEELEY
(uncomfortably)
Beat it

FRANCIE
(firmly)
Mama said
BOYS
(derisively)
Mama said Go on we dont want no
skirts around Look whos got to do
what his mama said

Neeley is definitely in a spot Keyed by the situation one
of the boys gets a new idea He staggers as if drunk

BOY
(walking drunkenly)
Look at me Im Neeleys old man

There is laughter Both Nolans stiffen They are together
now Neeley unwinds what is left of the licorice whip and
gives it to Francie to hold

NEELEY
(ready for battle)
Do that again

BOY
Do what -- Auggie pushed me

NEELEY
Go on I dare you

AUGGIE
He didnt say nothin Its a free
country aint it

NEELEY
I never said it wasnt

FIRST BOY
Then the sidewalks free too

NEELEY
I guess what Im standin on is
mine while Im standin on it

AUGGIE
Then I guess what hes standin on
is his

FIRST BOY
Sure and I can do what I want to on
it

NEELEY

Well let him come over on my piece
and say somethin I dare him

BOY
Well who wants your old piece

NEELEY
Well then dont talk like you was
on my piece

BOY
Well who wants to

NEELEY
Well all right then

This procedure doesnt make much sense but it seems to
satisfy the immediacies Neeley is victorious With a lordly
air he walks over to Francie and takes back his licorice
whip and starts to wind it around his arm again

NEELEY
(to Francie)
Come on

They start down the sidewalk together and the scene
dissolves to the TENEMENT HALL as Francie and Neeley come up
the stairs to where Katie their mother is on her knees
beside a bucket scrubbing the floor

KATIE
Heavens sake is it that late
already Ill have to leave these
stairs go till later

She gets to her feet
FRANCIE
(showing the pennies)

Four cents

KATIE
Pretty good Dump the bucket Neeley

NEELEY
(tentatively)

Mama can I--
KATIE

No Bring the bucket and dump it
(starting up
the stairs)
Its the day for the insurance
collector I dont want him to catch
me lookin like this

They go up the stairs Neeley struggling with the bucket
They pass a blowzy woman going down with a basket on her

arm

WOMAN
Hot aint it

KATIE
Yes but Christmasll be here before
you know it

WOMAN
I got enough troubles without
thinkin about that

They go on down the hall toward the flats at the back
Neeley disappears into the lavatory to dump the bucket --
Katie stops at the door to search for their key A boy
HENNY GADDIS comes out of the door across the hall

KATIE
Hows your sister today Henny

HENNY
(matter-of-factly)
Poorly thank you

Just as he answers Neeley comes up with the bucket His
answer means so little to him that almost simultaneously
Henny kicks the bucket out of Neeleys hand It clatters to
the floor Henny beats it and Neeley gives chase

Katie unlocks the door just as Flossie Hennys sister
appears in the doorway She is pathetically thin with dark
luminous eyes and is dressed unlike any other occupant of
the tenement in a soft feminine dress She is very
conscious of the dress as she smiles shyly at them

KATIE
Why hello Flossie dear

FLOSSIE
Hello Mrs Nolan
(then shyly)
Dont -- dont you notice somethin

KATIE
(not getting it)
Why seems to me you look mighty
well Much better dont she
Francie

FLOSSIE
No I dont I dont--

This is not what she wanted to hear She slams the door shut
quickly The sound of coughing can be heard Katie stares at
the door for a second without understanding and then unlocks
her own door and goes in

The NOLAN KITCHEN as Katie and Francie enter The kitchen is
the most used room of the flat -- They cook and eat and
live here It is bare but clean and neat It has an iron
stove A fire escape can be seen past the window Beyond
this we get a glimpse of the scraggly tree in the yard

KATIE
(as she crosses
to the bedroom)
Heat up the coffee while I fix up

Francie starts to make the fire Neeley appears in the
doorway triumphantly with Henny meekly carrying the bucket
He sets it down inside the kitchen

NEELEY
(victoriously)
Thats better

Neeley pushes Henny outside and shuts the door Being always
hungry Neeley starts to look for something to fill in until
dinner is ready and finds a few crumbs in a cracker box on
the table As he does so he sees the four pennies where
Francie has put them down He stares at them a moment and
an idea takes shape in his mind

NEELEY
Mom

KATIE
(from the bedroom)
Yes Neeley

NEELEY
(craftily)
Mom if there was a rule about
somethin that doesnt mean you
couldnt do somethin else once ina
while I mean if it was important

does it
KATIE
(offscene)
No Neeley
NEELEY

If it was important I mean people
could change their minds about
somethin and its all right aint
it

KATIE
(still offscene)
Yes I guess so

NEELEY
Well mom I was just thinkin you
know I never smoke cigarettes
because you said I mustnt even if
some of the fellers make fun of me
I dont but its been kinda hot
lately and--
KATIE
(interrupting quite
pleasant about it)
Neeley you cannot have any of those
pennies to buy an ice-cream cone
They go in the bank same as usual

Neeley gives this a quick startled reaction How in the
world did Katie know what he was trying to do before he
really got to his point It is a distinct letdown --
Francie busy at the stove smiles at his reaction

KATIE
(from another room)
Bring em in here Neeley

Dutifully Neeley picks them up and starts for the other
room and the scene cuts to the BEDROOM which is small
with a lumpy double bed and an old bureau with a wall
mirror Katie is primping before the mirror and you have to
be rather careful to look in the right place or it will
distort Neeley enters with the pennies Katie goes to the
closet and Neeley follows her -- The closet contains very
little in the way of clothes The condensed milk can used
as a bank is nailed to the floor

KATIE
Half of everything we get goes into
the bank Thats the way it is and
thats the way its going to stay
Now put em in there

NEELEY
(obeying)
Gosh I bet we got about a hundred
dollars in that ole bank by now

Katie comes out of the closet and returns to the mirror

KATIE
(dryly)
Nines more like it

There is a sound outside of a limb of a tree splitting At
this the scene cuts to the KITCHEN where Francie has turned
from the stove in time to see the limb outside the window
sway and disappear from view

FRANCIE
Mama -- theyre cutting the tree

Neeley tumbles into the kitchen followed by Katie carrying
her hairbrush They crowd behind Francie at the window to

look out

Looking out the window from their angle we see two men
sawing the limbs off the tree Katie

KATIE

stares at it a moment

Oh thats too bad it was kind of
pretty there and the birds sittin

in it sometimes like they do

FRANCIE
Papa loved that tree

KATIE
(abruptly)

Oh quit moonin over it it got in
the way of the washing A tree aint
goin to put no pennies in the bank

She starts for the bedroom Francie is mildly bewildered by
this sudden change Katie is a little sorry for her
abruptness but before she can say anything there is a

knock on the door

KATIE

Its Mr Barker Get out the saucer
and give it a wipe I think theres

matches in it
(then as a small
apology for her
outbreak)

If -- if you want you can stay in

the room while hes here

Katie hurries back into the bedroom

Francie gets the saucer

out sets it down and then hurries to the door to admit Mr
Barker Mr Barker is a kindly enough little man rather

old but with the soul of a busybody

He is an important

visitor since in making his collections he sees almost

everyone and is a sort of newspaper

for the neighborhood

gossip Consequently the Nolans treat him with their best

manners

FRANCIE
(with her best
book-manners)

How do you do Mr Barker Mama is
temporarily detained but will join

you directly
Neeley gives her a withering look

MR BARKER

You got manners right out of a book

Francie
(to Katie as
she enters)

And company or no company Mrs
Nolan always looks the lady You

should see some of my people

even
ladies with husbands that work
steady--

He stops realizing this is not a very good point to
bring up Katie stiffens a little

KATIE
(with dignity)

Wont you come in the parlor and
have a cup of coffee

MR BARKER
That I will and your hospitality is
very kind Mrs Nolan

They start for the parlor Mr Barker bows gallantly for
Katie to precede him through the door She pauses to take
some coins out of an old cup on a shelf Francie
automatically starts to get the cup of coffee

The PARLOR is dark small and stuffy It is seldom used
The couch that serves as Francies bed is under the window
-- Katie and Mr Barker are followed by Neeley Mr Barker
seats himself in the best chair and takes out his fountain
pen to write the receipts He talks steadily

MR BARKER

(cheerfully)
Well old man Gentrys off to jail
again
KATIE

Thats too bad

MR BARKER
(hurriedly)
But shes keepin up his insurance
just the same

KATIE
And heres ours -- ten cents for me
ten for Mr Nolan a nickel for each
of the children

MR BARKER
And youll never regret it A fine
funeral for every member of the
family heaven forbid

He is busy writing the receipts as Francie appears with the
cup of coffee and can of condensed milk Mr Barker accepts
it and pours the condensed milk lavishly -- The Nolan
family watch fascinated as he continues to pour the milk
-- Mr Barker finally ceases pouring and the Nolans are
relieved He talks steadily as he does this

MR BARKER
Thank you Francie And your weekly
receipts Mrs Nolan

(he gives them to her)
Now theres one party not far from
here I wouldnt like to say who
that didnt get no receipts this
week And not naming any names I
will say that its a family that the
Angel of Death has marked on its
invitation list heaven forbid

NEELEY
Henny says his sisters got one leg
in the grave

KATIE
Neeley

MR BARKER
Ttll mean Potters Field most
likely Well thats what people
get wastin good money to give her
dresses instead of insurance
dresses thatll last longer than she
will It all depends on what folks
thinks is important

FRANCIE
But papa says that sometimes--

KATIE
Thats right Mr Barker it all
depends on what folks think is
important

MR BARKER
And how is Mr Nolan is he working
or not working some tell me one
thing some another -- I dont
listen

KATIE
Mr Nolan bein a singing waiter Mr
Barker and what you might call an
artist his work dont come steady
like other peoples But Im sure
youll remember when you talk to
folks that the Nolans have always
paid their insurance on the dot

Francie gives her mother an admiring look for this defense
of Johnny

MR BARKER
(retreating)
You surely dont think Id go around
spreadin gossip about my clients
Mrs Nolan

KATIE
Oh sure not How is my mother Mr
Barker

MR BARKER

In the prime Mrs Nolan fine as

can be she says to tell you shell

be over tonight the same as usual
(then with relish)

And I trust youre happy with the

news about your sister

Katie is instantly alert It is quite evident that here is
news she does not know but she does not like to admit it

KATIE
Just which news do you mean Mr
Barker

MR BARKER

Well it must be shes savin it to
surprise you with tonight when the
familys all here together

KATIE
(apprehensively)
Id take it kindly if you told me
what you mean

MR BARKER

(warming to his work)
Well I trot around the same as usual
to collect her weekly dime and what
do you think happens -- well sir
she gives me two dimes

(he pauses for effect)
Yessir shes done it again shes
got herself a brand-new husband
and--

KATIE
(startled)
Oh no

She breaks off abruptly It is none of Mr Barkers business
that Sissy had never been divorced from her last spouse The
children are fascinated Mr Barker is in his element
Katies worry about the marriage will make a fine story
indeed

MR BARKER
Well now I suppose you mean about
her still bein married I dont
mind sayin the same thought
occurred to me But Im sure it must
be all right she must have made
some arrangement but--

KATIE
Im quite sure she did Mr Barker
Im sure that--

NEELEY
(fascinated)
Does she call this one Bill too

His question makes Katie sharply aware of the presence of
the children They shouldnt be hearing such a discussion

KATIE
You children run along now and do
the marketing Take some money from
the cup--

NEELEY
Aw but mom I want to hear about
Aunt Sissy

KATIE
Take the money and get a five-cent
soup bone off of Hasslers dont
get the chopped meat from him
though he grinds it behind closed
doors and heaven only knows Go to
Werners for the meat get round
steak chopped ten cents worth and
dont let him give it to you off the
plate Take an onion with you and
ask him to chop it in And dont
forget just at the last to ask for
a piece of suet to fry it with

During this domestic discussion Mr Barker does a little
snooping He tries with his finger to see if there is any
dust on the table and is disappointed when there is none

Then he moves a small hassock with his foot

and is delighted

to discover as he suspected that it covers a hole in the

carpet

The Nolans are unaware of this

FRANCIE
He wont always do that mama he--

KATIE
Tell him your mother said And then
go for the bread

NEELEY
Its Saturday mom can we--

KATIE
All right all right Ask for a nice
pie not too crushed and go on now
Reluctantly they leave Katie turns back to Mr

and do it

FRANCIE
(reluctant to go)
Mama we know Aunt Sissys been
married before

NEELEY
Sure I can remember two Uncle Bills

KATIE
Thats nothing for you to talk
about go on now and get things
done

KATIE

You got no right Mr Barker to be
carryin tales about my sister as
though there was somethin wrong
Shes funny some ways maybe but
she wouldnt do nothin wrong So
Id like it if you didnt talk to
anybody about it like it was

MR BARKER
(lying of course)
Strike me dead if Id ever think of
mentionin it to anybody but you

KATIE

(dryly)
Yeah sure I know

(she sits down)
Well you might as well go on and
tell me what you do know No point
in my bein the only one that dont
hear it

MR BARKER
(eagerly starting
his story)
Well--

The scene dissolves to WERNERS BUTCHER SHOP
and Neeley in front of the counter Werner is

them

WERNER
Ten cents worth of round steak You
want it ground

FRANCIE
No

WERNER

Barker

with Francie
waiting on
Youre sure now Wasnt twenty
minutes ago I ground that whole
plateful fresh

FRANCIE
No thank you

Werner takes some chunks of meat out of the case and starts
to wrap them

FRANCIE
Oh I forgot My mother wants it
ground
WERNER
(giving her a
dirty look)

You dont tell me

The children make no answer He gives an angry exclamation
and gives up -- starts to grind the meat Francie reaches
timidly across the counter with her onion

FRANCIE
Mama said to chop up this onion in it

WERNER
Oh she did

But he takes the onion angrily and puts it in the grinder
with the meat He starts again to wrap the ground product
At this point Francie takes a deep breath and blurts out the
last instructions

FRANCIE
And-a-piece-of-suet-to-fry-it-with-
mama-said

Werner stands for a moment as though turned to stone

WERNER
Sweet jumpin Christopher

But he takes the piece of suet and puts it on top of the
meat as he folds the paper around it The Nolans have won

This dissolves to HASSLERS BUTCHER SHOP Neeley is peering
through the window to watch Francie on the inside make her
purchase He is taking pains to keep himself and the package
of ground meat out of sight

Inside the BUTCHER SHOP Hassler a kindly man is
exhibiting a husky-looking soup bone before he wraps it up
for Francie

HASSLER
Aint that a beauty though Now you
tell your mama when she cooks it
tell her to take the marrow out and
spread it on a piece of bread for
you Thats good and you need to
get some meat on your bones
(he laughs at this
joke as he slaps the
package down)
And here
(he slices off a thin
slice of liverwurst and
offers it to Francie)

Do me a favor -- try this and see if
you think its all right for my
customers

He is thin-make covering up a good deed and Francie knows
it She takes the slice of liverwurst and tastes it

FRANCIE
Yes sir

HASSLER
Well thats fine Now you finish
that before you get home Hows
your papa

FRANCIE
Hes fine sir

Francie exits Hassler smiling after her

Outside the butcher shop Francie joins Neeley and they
start down the street She breaks the piece of liverwurst in
two and gives Neeley half He wolfs it

NEELEY
Free

FRANCIE

(moved by the kindliness

of the world)
He made out he wanted me to tell him
did it taste all right

(she blurts out

with sudden passion)
I wish we could buy all our meat
from Hasslers I wish he didnt
grind his meat behind closed doors

NEELEY
Well you dont have to bawl about
it

Francie isnt really crying but she could

This dissolves to the exterior of LOSHERS BAKERY and STALE
BREAD STORE A sign reads NOT QUITE FRESH BREAD 2 LOAVES
FOR 5¢ A long queue is waiting patiently for the doors to
open The scene moves to the bakery window next door where
Francie and Neeley meat packages tucked under their arms
are gazing longingly into the window at a huge chocolate
cake on display

FRANCIE
You know mama thinks we dont know
anything

NEELEY

(getting the

drift at once)
Yeah she acts like we were kids or
somethin’

(they edge along to

a platter of cream

puffs and stare)
I bet she has a fight with Aunt
Sissy tonight

FRANCIE
Its got something to do with men
who like Aunt Sissy too much

NEELEY
Papa says wed ought to make
everybody like us

FRANCIE
I guess maybe ladies shouldnt
(then thoughtfully)
Maybe Aunt Sissy wouldnta changed
husbands so much if any of her
babies had lived Shes crazy about
babies

NEELEY
Look whos talkin about babies A
lot you know

FRANCIE
I know as much as you do

NEELEY
You dont know nothin

FRANCIE
You think youre so smart Boys make
me sick

NEELEY

Well what do ya think girls make
people you think--

But there is a sudden interrupting shout from the crowd as
the stale bread store door is thrown open and the people
push forward

Francie and Neeley their argument forgotten at once adjust
their packages and stalk toward the entrance Their eyes
flash with the light of battle like a fighter advancing
across the ring to engage his opponent

At the entrance the crowd is pressing forward A kid dashes
out of nowhere to the head of the line and worms his way
through the door This seems to be the signal for the
disappearance of all semblance of order Neeley fights his
way in Francie follows through the hole made by him The
crowd is storming the counter behind which two harassed
clerks dole out the bread and collect the money

AD LIBS
Two loaves I was first Four loaves
Quit shovin

Neeley squirms pushes fights his way to the counter
Francie is right behind him

NEELEY
Six loaves

FRANCIE
And a pie not too crushed

This dissolves to the NOLAN KITCHEN where the children are
just dumping their packages onto the table This marks the
end of their chores and the beginning of that part of the
day which is theirs Katie examines the bread

KATIE
This breads fine I wouldnt be
surprised if it wasnt moren three
days old

NEELEY
Is that all Mom Can we go now

KATIE
Yes -- youre free

Neeley bolts for his room and Francie for the parlor while
Katie starts to put the things away In a moment Neeley
reappears with a baseball glove and heads for the door
Francie emerges more quietly with a library book

KATIE
Wheres the fire

NEELEY
(on his way)
Theres a Dodgers scout around
He disappears and the door bangs behind him

KATIE
(to Francie)
Where you goin

FRANCIE
Oh no place much

KATIE
Well dont go dream walkin
crossin the streets

Francie is gone too and as Katie smiles after them the
scene dissolves to the exterior of the PUBLIC LIBRARY

Its a rather small library but it has dignity Francie
hurries down the street her attitude and pace changing as
she arrives She stops a moment then starts slowly and
reverently to mount the shallow steps as the scene dissolves
through to the interior Francie enters into the hush of the
room the door closing soundlessly behind her and she
advances to the librarians desk A few people are reading
at the tables or are at the stacks

At the desk she offers her book The librarian takes the
card stamps it mechanically returns it without once
looking at her Francie meantime has reverently touched the
blue bowl with yellow flowers and the polished desk Now
she takes her card and almost tiptoes to the shelves The
librarian stacks the returned book we see it is by
Browning

FRANCIE passing the shelves lingers at the Cs Then she
turns dutifully to the Bs runs her finger through the
Brownings and chooses the volume which comes next She
goes back to the desk

At the desk she offers the B book The librarian stamps
mechanically then notices the title Burtons Anatomy of
Melancholy and for the first time looks curiously at
Francie

LIBRARIAN
Burtons Anatomy of Melancholy Are
you sure you want this

FRANCIE
Yes maam

LIBRARIAN
Dont you think its a trifle over
your head

FRANCIE
Yes maam -- I mean yes maam
LIBRARIAN
Well why did you select it

FRANCIE
Well I -- I read all the authors
that far all the ones that begin
with A and then the B authors up to
Burton Its next

LIBRARIAN
You dont mean youre trying to read
your way straight through the
library

FRANCIE
Yes maam

LIBRARIAN
But a book like that youll only be
confused and--

FRANCIE
Please I want to go on through the
alphabet -- I want to get to know

everything in the world

The librarian stares at her a moment It is evident that
Francie means it

LIBRARIAN
Well all right
(she marks the book --
then before she hands
it to Francie she adds)

Only -- look do something for me
will you -- take another one too --
here Lavender and Old Lace -- just

for fun Its Saturday Ill have a
headache thinking about you wrestling
with The Anatomy of Melancholy all
weekend Will you

FRANCIE
(smiling shyly)
Yes maam

The librarian marks the book and Francie starts out with it
the librarian smiling after her

This dissolves to the YARD of the NOLAN TENEMENT in the
afternoon The tree shorn of its limbs stands like a
scarecrow A man is mounted on a ladder retying the
clotheslines Women hang from the windows giving free advice
and gossiping

WOMEN
A little to the left Mrs
Crackenbox You think I want for Mrs
Wittelys baby-clothes to drip on my
good sheets Why dont you try oil of
cloves Nothin wont make her stop
shes cuttin her teeth Didja hear
old man Hammerslaw taken out last
night Theyd oughta make the stairs
wider or the coffins narrower

Mixed with this are the sounds of a baby crying and the
shouts of kids

e camera moves steadily past this bedlam and up to the
econd-floor rear fire-escape outside the Nolan window to
iscover Francie completely oblivious to all the noise
ating peppermints and having fun crying pleasurably over
e sorrows of her book The bedlam continues over her but
e hears nothing She comes to a pausing place where it is
too beautiful to go on closes the book and sits

ling in its tragedy -- but managing to take another
eppermint through the tears -- Suddenly her head lifts as
e hears singing faint at first then stronger It is her
athers voice singing Molly Malone As soon as she is

she is galvanized into action and scrambles toward the

The KITCHEN Francie rushes to the door and throws it open
as the singing comes closer She gets it open before the
last line is finished and Johnny her father is revealed
This is a game of long-standing to try to get the door open
before he finishes the last line Johnny holds out his arms
and Francie flings herself into them joyfully

FRANCIE
I won I won

Johnny laughs and holds her for a moment Johnny is nice-
looking debonair He is a free soul who could give and take
superb happiness if only the world contained no economic
problems no responsibilities beyond the joy of living It
isnt so much that he shirks the responsibilities of a
family man as that he simply cannot cope with them He is
man enough to be bitterly ashamed of his weakness but not
quite man enough to overcome it The truth is that Johnny
has never quite grown up His charm and his gift of play
are something like those of a child His moods are
extravagant and volatile like a childs He wears the only
suit he possesses -- a shabby Tuxedo badge of his trade
with it a derby jauntily worn At the moment he is ina
very high mood because he has a job for tonight so that
momentarily he feels more like the head of his house than
he ordinarily does

JOHNNY
Well now I wouldnt be so sure o
that if I was you
FRANCIE
But I did I got it open before you
finished thats the rules

JOHNNY
But I come up one flight two steps
at a time before I remembered Dont
that make a difference

FRANCIE
No sir the rules--

JOHNNY
And in a manner of speakin you
never stopped me at all because my
heart kept right on singin

FRANCIE
Oh papa youre joking

JOHNNY
Well maybe Ill let you get away
with winnin this time Prima Donna
(looking around)
And wheres your beautiful mama

FRANCIE
Finishing the halls She must be up
on the top floor or shed have heard
you

Unconsciously and almost imperceptibly Johnny relaxes He
is instinctively more at ease with Francie than with Katie

JOHNNY
Well in that case youd better be
gettin busy Why arent you layin
out my clothes

FRANCIE
Youre always makin fun papa you
know you havent any more clothes

JOHNNY
Whats this then

FRANCIE
A tie

JOHNNY

FRANCIE
A dickey

JOHNNY

And this
FRANCIE
An apron

JOHNNY
Thems clothes arent they And

FRANCIE
Oh papa youve got a job for

(savoring his

good news)
Do you see the palm o that hand

FRANCIE

JOHNNY

JOHNNY

He pretends not to remember
FRANCIE
(fussed)
Oh papa I cant sing

JOHNNY
Come on youre holdin up the
singin

FRANCIE
(shyly)
As fair as the flowers in the dell--

JOHNNY
Better singin I never heard

FRANCIE
(shyly)
I love to iron for you papa

JOHNNY

(pouring the coffee

and bringing it down

to the table)
You know a day like this is like
somebody givin you a present
everything just right I wonder how
did folks get on before coffee was
invented Ah the world would be a
fine place if--

(he gets away from

this thought as

quickly as possible)
Prima Donna do you know youre
gonna make a mighty nice wife for
somebody some day

FRANCIE
Oh papa
JOHNNY
(teasing)
And pretty too -- that is if your

nose dont grow crooked

FRANCIE
Could it really -- honest

JOHNNY
Ah its the prettiest nose in
Brooklyn

FRANCIE
Oh papa it isnt

JOHNNY
Who says it isnt You just tell me
who says so and Ill take care of
him

FRANCIE
Papa youre crazy

JOHNNY
You know somethin else you aint
gonna be ironin like that no more
when that impresario comes around
Things are gonna be different around
here you wait and see

FRANCIE
Yes papa

JOHNNY
Whats the wish you wish the most
when our ship comes sailin in

FRANCIE
(not looking at him)
It already came true

JOHNNY
What was it baby
(she irons and
wont look at him)
Come on tell me now

FRANCIE
I -- I wished when you came home
today you wouldnt be -- sick
JOHNNY

(moved)
Who told you to call it sick baby

(then trying to

get away from this)
Ah now you shouldnt be wastin
wishes like that you ought to be
savin them for a silk dress or
somethin Havent you got a better
wish than that

FRANCIE
(hesitantly)
Well--
JOHNNY
Come on
FRANCIE

I wish mama wont be too mad with
Aunt Sissy

JOHNNY
What about Aunt Sissy
FRANCIE
Shes gone and got herself a new
husband again

JOHNNY
(laughing)
No If there aint a woman for you
-- If one husband dont suit her
she keeps right on lookin for the

best Uh -- what did your mama say
FRANCIE

Well -- she didnt like it
JOHNNY

Yeah I wouldnt be surprised

FRANCIE
Couldnt you -- sort of say
something to mama not to be too
mad

JOHNNY
Why sure I could Prima Donna --
and I will

FRANCIE

Oh thank you papa

JOHNNY
Now aint you got a real wish -- one
just for you

FRANCIE
Well -- did you see it papa

JOHNNY
What

FRANCIE
Out the window -- our tree theyve
killed it

He crosses to the window and she follows

JOHNNY
(looking out)
Well look at that now

FRANCIE
(fiercely)
They didnt have any right to kill
it did they papa

JOHNNY
(sensing how serious
it is with her)
Wait a minute now they havent
killed it Why they couldnt kill
that tree

FRANCIE
Honest

JOHNNY

Why sure baby Now look dont you
tell me that trees goin to lay
down and die that easy You look at
that tree see where its comin
from -- right up out of the cement
Didnt anybody plant it it didnt
ask the cement could it grow it
just couldnt help growin so much
it pushed that ole cement right out
of the way When youre bustin with
somethin like that cant anybody
stop it Like that little ole bird
listen to him--

(he imitates a bird)
He dont ask nobody can he sing He
dont take no lessons hes just so
full of singin its got to bust out
someplace Why they could cut that
tree way down to the ground and the
rootd shove up some place else in
the cement Just you wait until next
Spring and youll see Prima Donna
(their eyes meet and
Francies worry is
aid to rest)
Well now this aint earnin the
family bread

(he gets his hat and

brushes it carefully

with his sleeve)
Havent you got one little wish
thats just for you

FRANCIE
No papa I -- I just --

JOHNNY
Just what

FRANCIE

I just love you so much papa
She clings to him tightly Johnny holds her

JOHNNY

(gently moved)
Well what do you know Listen if I
get a lot of tips tonight you know
what Im gonna do Im gonna put two
bucks on a horse I know runnin
Monday Ill win ten then Ill put
the ten on another horse If I use
my head and have any luck maybe Ill

know what Im gonna do

FRANCIE
What papa

JOHNNY
Im gonna take you on a trip just
you and me on a regular train
Maybe well go down South and see
where the cotton grows You know
Down where the cotton blossoms
blow

To make her laugh he does a little step with this

JOHNNY
(very gently)
Youre a nice girl baby Come on
we better go tell your mama the news
about my job

He puts his derby on at a rakish angle and Francie gives
him the package with the apron They go out together -- We
then see them in the HALL Johnny is feeling very good
indeed and he deliberately turns on the charm as he calls
up the stairs

JOHNNY
(calling)
Anybody seen Johnny Nolans wife

He starts gayly up Francie looking after him adoringly
and the scene cuts to the UPPER HALL where Katie is on her
knees on the stairs scrubbing her way down She is slightly
apprehensive as she looks down quickly

KATIE
Johnny You all right

JOHNNY
(coming up the stairs)
And why wouldnt I be married to
the most beautiful woman in
Williamsburg Brooklyn

KATIE
(relieved)
Youre shoutin it so theyll hear
you over to Manhattan

JOHNNY
Dont you get fresh with me tonight
Happens Im workin at Klommers --
big weddin party

Katie is pleased in a maternal way but values the news for
what it is -- a one-night job -- whereas to Johnny it
changes the complexion of his world and ought to change her
world To Katie his enthusiasms are an old and now a
somewhat humorous story her humor is a necessary defense
against disappointments

KATIE
I thought you was kinda extra dressy
Well looks like you wont get home
before the sun comes up

JOHNNY
The later the better the more tips
the more fine silk stockings for my
wifes pretty legs

KATIE
(smiling)
Silk stockins is just what I need

She turns away to go on working A man comes up the stairs
past them and a couple of tenants look out from their doors
to see whats going on An audience always inspires Johnny

JOHNNY
Just a minute Mrs Nolan Dont you
think you better kiss me for luck

KATIE
The whole house is lookin

JOHNNY

Who cares

(But he draws her back
then speaks softly)
This is the best job I had ina
couple a months Maybe Ill get
more from tonight

He puts his arm around her She pretends to be out of
patience with him but she is pleased None of the other
women in the tenement get treated like this by their
husbands

KATIE
You better get on then good jobs
dont wait--

JOHNNY
A jobs no good without you kiss me

She lets him kiss her and is warmed in spite of herself
Then she gives him a playful push and speaks almost
ruefully

KATIE
Well you still got a way with you
Johnny Nolan Go on now before you
know it those folks at the weddin
will be an old married couple

JOHNNY
Before you know it I wont go at
all Theirs aint the only weddin
that counts

KATIE
(smiling)
Put your hat on now and get out of
here before somebody else cops that
job

He puts his hat on jauntily grins and comes to the head
of the stairs But he catches Francies eye fixed on him
from the bottom He turns back to Katie outwardly jaunty
but actually a bit awkward

JOHNNY
(hesitantly)
Oh -- Francie tells me Sissys gone
and done it again Dont -- I mean
maybe hes a nice fellow -- dont be

too hard on her huh

KATIE
(dryly)
Theyve all been nice fellows Beat
it now Johnny

A little lamely Johnny turns away He is glad to have this
over with His jauntiness returns He tips his hat to Katie
elaborately

JOHNNY
Thats just a sample Madam If you
like my stock drop me a card and
Ill be around again

Katie has to smile Johnny starts down the stairs
pretending to be aware for the first time of his small
audience He tips his hat again

JOHNNY
Oh -- evening folks

At the foot of the stairs Francie delighted by the whole

scene slips her hand into his and accompanies him proudly
-- The view moves with them and picks up Flossie Gaddis
still in her pretty dress shy and wistful in her doorway
When she sees him she starts to smile Johnny stops

JOHNNY
Well will you look at our beautiful
princess tonight in a brand new
gown

FLOSSIE
(shyly but infinitely
pleased)
Its made out of silk

JOHNNY
Why lets see Silk Why dont you
tell me that -- that dress is made

out of flower petals and birds wings
and a little old piece of cloud
Anybody could tell that

Flossie laughs softly and it is beautiful to see Johnny
laughs too pats her head and starts on -- Francies
reaction marks her worship of this father of hers The scene
moves on again as they go on down the stairs They pass two
old ladies who are standing in the doorway On the door is a
sign Piano and Vocal

JOHNNY
(tipping his hat)
Evening Miss Lizzie Miss Maggie

THE MISSES TYNMORE
We wish you well Mr Nolan

JOHNNY
Thank you ladies Evening Mr
Spencer

MR SPENCER
(going up stairs)
Working tonight Johnny

JOHNNY
Sure big weddin party

They pass through the front door and on to the street

We get a glimpse of Katie looking down for a moment after
Johnny Her face shows the mixture of her feelings She
sighs a little and turns back to work

The STREET Johnny and Francie come down the front steps
and what is to her a small triumphal march continues
She holds onto his arm and is enormously proud A couple of
young girls are sitting on the steps

JOHNNY
(tipping his hat again)
Good evening young ladies

GIRLS
Good evening Mr Nolan

They giggle a little flirtatiously Johnny is unaware but
Francie gives them a look Her head goes higher and she
holds tighter to Johnnys arm

FRANCIE
What did mama say about Aunt Sissy

JOHNNY
Dont you worry -- itll be all
right Your Aunt Sissys a fine
woman Francie

Suddenly he stops at the window of the hardware shop as they
pass it

JOHNNY
Look at all the things they got No
use talkin some day Im gonna get
you them skates

FRANCIE
(maternally)
Mama said not to be late papa

JOHNNY
God invented time Prima Donna and
whenever He invents somethin
theres always plenty of it
(moving down the window)
Look at them knives

FRANCIE
(gravely)
Mama says time is money

JOHNNY
Well I guess maybe He wasnt
worryin about money right then

FRANCIE
(a little worried)
Theres your car papa

JOHNNY
(looking and
grinning at her)
Might as well catch it I guess

He kisses her quickly and goes toward the car Francie calls
goodbye after him and stands watching anxiously

Johnny swings onto the car just as it starts to move on He
smiles back then tips his hat with a fine flourish to
Francie

Nobody but papa has ever yet tipped his hat to her She is
so proud her eyes glisten suspiciously Her concern is gone
and nothing is left but worship She waves till the car is
out of sight And the scene fades out

B

The NOLAN KITCHEN fades in It is evening First we see
FRANCIE setting the table but more concerned with reading
her book which is open on the table Then the scene pulls
back to reveal Neeley washing at the sink and Katie
transferring the food from the stove to the table

KATIE
Now tomorrow this bread1ll make up
real nice with a sauce of ketchup
and coffee Use soap Neeley Monday
well slice it and fry it in bacon
fat and -- Francie youre not
listening put up that book

FRANCIE
(obeying)
Yes mama bacon fat

KATIE
Suppers ready

She and Francie sit while Neeley having splashed his face
with water dries it with a dish towel looking over
longingly

NEELEY
Oh boy we wont have to play no
North Pole this week Hey Am I
hungry

He comes to the table starts wolfing his food standing up

KATIE
And when werent you

FRANCIE
Mama
KATIE
Yes Francie
FRANCIE
(dreamily)

What does white mean

KATIE
Just white I guess What do you
mean what does it mean Neeley sit
down at your place

He sits down

FRANCIE
Well what do girls always wear it
for when they get married and when
theyre confirmed and when they
graduate -- why does it always have
to be white

KATIE
I dont know somebody just started
it I guess Lots of things like that

FRANCIE
Will I have a white dress when I
graduate

KATIE

Well see Neeleyll probably need
shoes by then

FRANCIE
But mama

KATIE
Talk to him about it If you can get
him to quit always comin through
his soles

FRANCIE
Just because hes a boy
(she changes right
out of her book
All right mama I will gladly do
without so my little brother can be
happy with new shoes

NEELEY
Little brother my eye you--

KATIE
Thatll do
(to Francie)
You read too much

The door suddenly bursts open and Aunt Sissy comes in -- but
she gives the impression of blowing in like a fresh breeze
She is a couple of years older than Katie lively
completely natural looks not unlike a street-walker but is
actually a simple direct earthy woman She carries some
magazines

SISSY
Well hey everybody
THE CHILDREN
(with cries of delight)

They fly into her arms and she embraces them warmly

(laughing)
Oh Bills got some other name --
Steve I think it is -- but I always
like Bill A good mans name with no
stuck-up about it Ah like I say
youll be crazy about him Katie

KATIE
Yeah but the question is howll

(genuinely troubled)
Its wrong Sissy its I mean
the other ones and--

SISSY
Whats wrong about it The others
was wrong Whats right about keepin
on with a guy when you dont love
each other any more

KATIE
But it aint just as easy as that
it--

FRANCIE

(earnestly - dreamily)
I think Aunt Sissy is right about
when love is dead

KATIE
(to Sissy)
Now look what you started It aint
anything to talk about in front of
them Every time you come around you
fill their heads with--

SISSY
All right kids you go on
downstairs awhile Your mamas got a
spankin up her sleeve and she
aint gonna feel right till she
gives it to somebody Might as well
get it over with

Neeley and Francie start out Francie turns at the door a
little worried about her aunt and mother

SISSY
You dont want to frown like that
snuggle-pup The fellows dont go
for that at all

Her grin is contagious and Francie is relieved She follows
Neeley out Sissy turns back to Katie with a grin

SISSY
All right kid lets have it the
works Im a disgrace you dont
know what youre goin to do with
me you cant hardly face the
neighbors with what they must be
sayin Im old enough to know
better -- Go on get it all off
your chest and then we can make up
and forget about it

KATIE
Thats right talk your way out of
it and you probably will too What
did mama say

SISSY
Oh you know mama she dont say
much but--

KATIE

Yeah I know

(imitating her mother)
Sissy is bad only where the men are
concerned but she is good in the
heart

(her smile dies)
But that aint it You make me
ashamed Sissy Folks got a right to
talk and the kids are bound to hear
It aint right for them And you can
get in trouble You aint real sure
what happened and theres laws
about things like that

SISSY
Look Katie so help me this time
its for keeps I aint even goin
to look at another guy And as for
the last one he cant be alive or
Id have heard from him I been
pretty good Seven years is a long
time for me to wait around not
bein married -- they said seven
years was all you had to wait and
I waited Where would I get the
money for a divorce

KATIE
(Sissy is hopeless)
Well for the life of me I dont
know what youve talked yourself
into -- but I got a feelin’ it aint
right

SISSY
(on the level)
Look kid all I know is it cant
be wrong or I couldnt feel like I
do about it Im dumb sure -- but
I know this much if I feel bad
about somethin its wrong and if
I feel good its right Ah you
couldnt get it Katie you got all
the breaks I never had -- you got
the kids and you got a guy youre
clear overboard about Youre lucky

KATIE
(with a touch
of bitterness)
Yeah Im that all right

SISSY
Sure you are And that makes all
the difference You got somethin to
stick to you--

KATIE

(with a sudden flare

she didnt know was

in her)
All right and where does crazy over
somebody get you It dont put no
pennies in the bank it dont buy no
clothes for the kids to go to school
-- maybe you got it better not
stickin to one man I wish I wasnt
crazy over him sometimes--

SISSY
Hey Katie--
KATIE
(unconsciously

her voice rises)
--And I wont have the kids takin
after him either him and those
dreamy ways I used to think so much
of -- not if I got to cut it right
out of their hearts

There is a pause that means a lot Katie hadnt the least
intention of saying that Sissy stares at her It is the
first knowledge Sissy has had that there was something
deeply wrong between Katie and Johnny

SISSY
Hey kid whatre you sayin

KATIE
Nothing I--

SISSY
Yes you are youre sayin plenty
Whats happened between you and
Johnny

KATIE
I dont know what Im sayin I
dont know what come over me

SISSY
Well look hon we better find out
Sure we got somethin to talk about
now

KATIE
No I dont want--

SISSY
Uh-uh youre the kid sister you
listen now Look you was awful
crazy about Johnny -- Dont tell me
I seen you it was like every woman
wants to be with a guy

KATIE
Yeah I know but--

SISSY
All right maybe Johnny didnt turn
out just like you figured sure he
drinks and all and youre the one
has had to make most of the livin
But everybodys got somethin And
you wasnt crazy about Johnny
because he was goin to be a banker
It was on account of-- well how he
laughed and how he could talk about
ings and -- and how you felt walkin
own the street holdin on to him and
avin other women look at you -- and
e way he had of sayin hello to
verybody like -- like he was givin
way somethin Thats what you was
razy about and that aint changed
dont know them things couldnt
ange in Johnny not even if he
ried hes just -- different And
ats what you was crazy over If
eres been any changin maybe
its you kid You still got all you
was crazy over aint you

tretrtaHhtavdodtTyad

KATIE
(moved looking
away from Sissy)
Yeah I--

SISSY
Then you thank your lucky stars for
what you got Katie Nolan and take
the rest along with it And take it
from me you got a lot and dont
think you havent
There is a pause Sissy really means it And it has moved
Katie enough to make her very near tears but she would not
show this for anything in the world She manages a little
grin

KATIE
I mightve known startin out to
take you apart Id wind up with
you workin me over

It is as close as she can come to acknowledging in words the
truth of what Sissy has said But their eyes meet and there
is a nice moment between them These two sisters like one
another at that moment as well as they have in a long time

SISSY
Nice goin -- Youre a nice girl
Katie

The warmth between them holds as the scene dissolves to the
NOLAN TENEMENT BUILDING First we see NEELEY bent over with
his hands on his knees playing hes an infielder Hes
playing all by himself He throws a small ball against the
wall feels it as it bounces back to him and tags out an
imaginary runner on second base Hes very intent on all
this Evidently theres some question about the decision
Neeley speaks to the imaginary umpire with righteous anger

NEELEY
Aw he was out a mile I tell you
Dont give me that -- well thats

better

Evidently he wins the argument with the umpire because he
is mollified and returns to his fielding position The
camera pulls back to reveal the front of the tenement just
as Sissy emerges from the front door Francie is sitting
quietly on one of the doorsteps fingering a pair of roller
skates A man and his wife are on the steps higher up and
Sissy has to step over them to get down

SISSY
(cheerfully)
Dont stir yourself Pal

She steps over him with a grin He grins in answer The wife
recognizes Sissy

SHEILAS MOTHER
(stiffly)
We better go in Alfred

Sissy gets it but doesnt care Francie looks up eagerly
and Neeley quits his hall game to come over to Aunt Sissy

NEELEY
Howd you come out Aunt Sissy

SISSY
(grinning)

No decision It was a draw

(she smiles at them)
your moms bark is worse than
er bite -- you know Look tell me
omethin when papas home I bet
im and mama laugh a plenty dont
ey -- you know like they always
id

Qadyropp

NEELEY

Sure pop can make anybody laugh
when he wants to except when hes
drunk

FRANCIE
Sick Neeley mama says to call it

NEELEY

(returning to

his ball game)
Okay sick then Funny he aint
like other guys when he gets that
way he gets all quiet

(he tags another

runner)
Thatll teach you to steal a base
on I guess

FRANCIE
(to Sissy)
Mama kind of doesnt want to
sometimes but after a while mostly
she does

SISSY
Sure Ill tell you somethin you
can do for me do all the laughin

you can -- you know keeps everybody
healthy

NEELEY
Okay

FRANCIE

(quoting from

a book again)
Laughter is the singing of the
angels

SISSY
Youre a funny kid head full of all
them things kind of like your pop
NEELEY
She tells lies like pop too

FRANCIE
(quickly)
He doesnt tell lies

NEELEY
Well I dont know what youd call
it he--

SISSY
(averting war)
Hey time out Ive had enough
battlin to last me today
(then to change
the subject)
Whered you get the skates

FRANCIE
Oh they arent ours Papa said he
was going to get us some though

NEELEY
Aw he didnt mean it he just said
that and Id like to know what you
call that if it aint lies

FRANCIE
He did so mean it Neeley Nolan

SISSY
Easy now
(to Francie)
Kind of like your papa dont you
lamb

FRANCIE
He does mean it doesnt he Aunt
Sissy

SISSY
Sure he means it hon he means it
-- every word Only -- well

sometimes things you know happen
But it kind of aint his fault he--

(realizing she is

becoming more and

more involved she

changes the subject)
I tell you what -- lets make out
Johnny gave you them skates like he
said and theyre yours it wont
hurt nobody

FRANCIE
But Aunt Sissy we couldnt it--
SISSY
No sense things standing around and
nobody using them

She starts to strap the skates on Neeley leaves his ball
game to come over for this new excitement

NEELEY
Hey can I put ‘em on next

SISSY
All right now Take it easy

Francie laughs in high enjoyment as Sissy steadies her The
front door of the tenement flies open and the little girl
who is the owner of the skates shows up

SHEILA
Hey you come back here with my
skates Mama

SISSY
Its all right honey we aint gonna
hurt ‘em

Sheilas mother appears Shes the woman who was sitting on
the step

SHEILA
Ma they stole my skates

The childs father appears in the doorway The woman
advances down the steps

SHEILAS MOTHER
You bring them back You put them
kids up to it you--

SISSY
(facing her)
Easy now nobodys hurt I only

borrowed em
SHEILAS FATHER
(mildly)
She isnt going off with them Effie
just--

SHEILAS MOTHER
(to her husband)
Dont you take up for that woman like
that you--

SISSY
(smiling at the husband)
You poor little guy you got to put
up with that all the time
The clamor of the argument has brought forth other neighbors

WOMAN
(horning in)
Ask her whose husband shed like to
borrow

SHEILA
(to Francie)
My mother says your aunts got dyed

hair
NEELEY
(belligerently)
Yeah
A KID

Hey the cop

The hubbub ceases McShane a rather young and nice looking
cop comes in

MCSHANE
Come on break it up break it up
now take it easy

SISSY
(smiling full at him)
Well Im sure glad you come along
handsome You look like you ought to
be able to whip a bunch of women
into line

MCSHANE
(making no response
to her impertinence)
Thats fine but maybe somebody
better tell me what all the
excitements about

SHEILAS MOTHER
e tried to steal my little girls
skates

a

WOMAN
She tried to vamp her husband

FRANCIE
We only borrowed them for just a
minute honest

SISSY
Thats right there wasnt nobody

frolic on a Saturday never hurt

MCSHANE

SISSY
(studying him)
You mean it too dont you Yeah I

Thats kind of nice handsome

SHEILAS MOTHER
If you think youre goin to get out
of it makin eyes at the law--

SHEILA
Your aunts goin to the station

station house

Bedlam breaks loose again It is at this point that Katie
comes but the door and hurries forward

KATIE
Officer please
(as she comes up to him)
This ladys my sister She didnt
mean any harm Im sure she didnt

MCSHANE
(studying her a
moment -- impressed)

Sure and it doesnt look to me like
any harms been done

(to the crowd)
Clear the streets now all of you

His tone is authoritative and the crowd starts to disperse

MCSHANE
(turning to Katie)
Ill see you ladies to your door

SISSY
(with a grin)
Thanks handsome

KATIE

(in reproof)
My sister is always trying to be
funny officer she doesnt mean
anything by it

(they pause

at the door)
Id like you to know this is the
first time my family ever got into

any trouble on the streets--
(looking at Sissy)

and Ill see it dont happen again

MCSHANE
I guess I know a lady when I meet
one maam -- My name is McShane and

Im glad I could be of service to
you maam

He turns and goes

SISSY
(grinning)
He sure took a shine to you Katie

KATIE
Go on
(fussed)
Whod look at me

SISSY
He would
KATIE
(in an odd mood for
a moment -- looking

at her hands)
Funny you kind of forget sometimes
that youre a woman

FRANCIE
He wasnt going to arrest us mama
Aunt Sissy talked him out of it And
we got to skate on em anyway
didnt we Aunt Sissy

This makes Katie look at Francie Francie has evidently
enjoyed the excitement from the adventure and this
disturbs Katie

KATIE
You go on down the street and tell
Sheila and her mama youre sorry
now Francie

FRANCIE
Do I have to mama

Katie doesnt answer and Francie starts reluctantly down
the street Katie watches her go a minute and then turns
back to look at Sissy levelly

KATIE
I dont like sayin what Im goin
to Sissy
SISSY
(ruefully)
Oh golly are we off again

KATIE
Youre the only sister I got but--
I dont care for myself what people
think about you only-- I got the
kids to worry over and if I dont
do it nobody else will Youre bad
for em Sissy you got Francie in
trouble right on the street You --
you might even make em trouble at
school

SISSY
(very quietly)
What is it youre tryin to say
kid

KATIE
Sissy Im askin you not to come
around any more My minds made up
and dont try changin it with any
more of that soft talk

SISSY
I wont Katie not if you mean it
But lets keep on talkin about
you Softs one thing kid but--
bein too hard is another

KATIE
(flaring)
All right it aint nice to be hard
but my children are goin to be
somebody if I got to turn into
granite rock to make em

Sissy studies her for a long moment Their eyes hold Katie
doesnt yield

SISSY

(with a funny

little smile)
I kind of wish you hadnt said that
kid

(she turns)
So long Katie Ill give your love
to Bill

She goes Katie stares after her Some of the inflexibility
leaves as she watches Sissy go She is bewildered mixed up
with the inner conflict she turns abruptly to go into

the tenement
The scene dissolves to the NOLAN KITCHEN at night First the
cover of a Gideon Bible in Neeleys hands comes into view
then the scene pulls back to reveal Neeley ready for bed
reading aloud Francie sits near holding a volume of
Shakespeare Katie is remaking a dress of hers for Francie
Grandma Rommely sits quietly listening Grandma Rommely is
of Austrian peasant stock old given much to silence She
has a faraway look and nods occasionally while she listens
to this reading which is very important to her It is a
good thing

NEELEY

(reading)
--and Nahor lived nine and twenty
years and begat Terah and Nahor
lived after he begat Terah an
hundred and nineteen years -- boy
thats oldern Grandma aint it --
and begat sons and daughters --
Okay thats the end of the page

FRANCIE
(reading immediately)
And dreaming night will hide our
joys no longer I would not from
thee Cressida Night hath been too
brief Troilus Beshrew the witch
with venomous --

NEELEY
(interrupting
disgusted)
Aw that aint even English

FRANCIE
It is so Shakespeare wrote the best
English of anybody

NEELEY
All right then you tell me what it
means youre so smart

FRANCIE
I didnt say I know what it means I
said I liked it

KATIE
Thatll do now

NEELEY
Okay but I bet you dont know what
it means either

KATIE
Maybe not but I know its good for
you
FRANCIE
(resuming her reading)
Beshrew the witch --

NEELEY
(grumbling to himself
She dont know what it means mom
dont know what it means Grandma
cant even read and gosh knows I
dont know--

FRANCIE
Mama I cant read if he--

NEELEY
--Just wastin time every night
readin stuff nobody knows what its
all about

KATIE

Well it aint as bad as that I get
some of it That about nights is too
brief that means short and
goodness knows they are and the
days too

(she measures the dress

against Francie as she

speaks)
Hold still a minute Now listen
Aunt Sissy brought us that Bible
from Sheepshead Bay and papa blew
in all his tips one time on that
Shakespeare because Grandma said
they was the greatest books and we
should read a page every night So
we aint gonna waste ‘em And I
dont know sometimes it does seem
kinda foolish but -- I guess it gets
you somewhere might help you find a
job someday you cant tell

Her defense of the custom winds up a little lamely but it
is the best she can muster None of them notices Grandma
until she speaks abruptly

GRANDMA ROMMELY
This reading will not stop I say
this thing

This is said quietly but with so much determination that
all three turn toward her She is completely immobile as she
tries to gather words which are difficult for her

GRANDMA ROMMELY
In the steerage we come to this new
land your grandfather and I Hard
we work but there is something we
ook for that we do not find So
this is not different I think from
that old country And then I watch
my children and then their children
And then I know when I am old I
now In that old country the child
can rise no higher than his fathers
state But here in this place the
children need not to walk out their
ives in the shoes of their elders
And this has to do something wit
the learning which is here free for
all people This is the thing that
with this learning each one is free
to go so far as he is good to make
of himself This way each child can
be better than the parent and this
is the true way things grow better
This to me who am old is the great
wonder of this country in this way
to be free I have missed this thing
and I have let my children miss it
but this shall not be so for my
childrens children This reading
will not stop

Probably never before has Grandma Rommely put so many words

together She is lost in them almost transfigured there

is deep strength behind her feeling The others are silent

a little awed by the unaccustomed speech The argument about
the reading is ended forever

GRANDMA ROMMELY
And you Katie It is not just for
the job You do not think well
about this nor about what you do
with your sister You have forgotten
to think with your heart There is a
coldness growing in you Katie

She has finished and she retires inside herself again
settling back in her chair There is a pause and there is
definitely nothing more to say It has had an effect on
Katie Francie looks from one to the other -- Finally
Katies eyes leave her mother and meet Francies Katie
nods Francie resumes the reading

FRANCIE
Beshrew the witch with venomous
wights she stays
As tediously as--

Katies eyes go back to her mother The old lady does not
look at her but nods again almost imperceptibly It is
good But her words coming on top of Sissys have shaken
Katie
The scene dissolves to a STREET late at night It is
practically deserted The shadowy figure of Johnny carrying
a couple of paper bags comes down the street from the
carline He is singing Call Me Up Some Rainy Afternoon

to himself Thereupon the scene cuts to the NOLAN PARLOR
where Francie is on her couch under the window The faint
sound of Johnnys singing awakens her Her face lights up
She looks out the window Then in her nightgown she
scurries for the kitchen

In the KITCHEN Katie is asleep with her head on her sewing
on the table as Francie enters Francie is startled at
seeing her mother there As she hesitates Katie stirs and
lifts her head The sound of the singing is closer as Johnny
comes up the stairs -- Katies and Francies eyes meet and
there is a sense of understanding between these two who
wait Instinctively Katies hands start to fix her hair

FRANCIE
Hes all right mama I dont think
hes sick

The singing approaches the door True to their game Francie
goes to open it before the song finishes The open door
reveals Johnny and his paper bags There is a second of
relief for both women when theyre sure he is sober

FRANCIE
Papa

JOHNNY
Well what do you know if it isnt
my beauty

(he is a little

surprised at seeing

Katie still up)
Hey Whatre you doing up this time
of night

KATIE
(a little awkwardly)
Oh I made up my mind to sit up for
you But I guess I aint used to the
hours any more

Johnny sets his bags on the table Katie resumes adjusting
her hair

JOHNNY
Leave it its nice

KATIE
(pleased)
Go on What you got in them bags
Francie the coffee

FRANCIE
(going to light
the stove)
Is it something to eat papa

JOHNNY

And what else with me comin froma
grand banquet

(and he empties

the bags)
French rolls a whole half of
lobster from the shores of Maryland
caviar all the way from sunny far
off Russia fried oysters cheese--
from -- from the mountain fastnesses
of la belle France

KATIE
What do you know about the mountain
fastnesses of France

FRANCIE
Is it better comin from there papa

JOHNNY
Supposed to be mighty good
(looking at Katie)
But comin home like this -- I know
thats good

KATIE
(a little awkwardly)
Well lets eat it no reason we
shouldnt have a party of our own

Abruptly Katie turns from setting the table and without
explanation disappears into the bedroom At the same time a
very sleepy Neeley appears from the other bedroom

NEELEY
Im hungry

KATIE
(from the bedroom)
Is that all you got to say to your

papa

NEELEY
Hello papa

He starts immediately pulling a chair up to the table
JOHNNY
(laughing)
His stomachs like the Irish sea no

bottom to it

Katie reappears shy and pretty her hair arranged and held
in place by a tortoise shell comb Johnny looks at her
moved

FRANCIE
Mama your wedding comb

KATIE
(a little shy at
her own sentiment)
Well aint this a kind of wedding
party

JOHNNY

(pulling out a

chair playing

up to the mood)
You bet it is I wish I couldve
swiped some champagne

(then as he

meets her eyes)
No I dont coffees better

Francie brings the coffee to the table and sits down next to
her father Neeley is already eating

JOHNNY
(looking at Katie
teasing)
Only will you look at whos tellin
me I dont know about the mountain
fastnesses of France

KATIE
(looking down fussed)
Oh that
JOHNNY
Yeah that -- imagine you forgettin
KATIE

Well I didnt not exactly only
that was a while back and--

JOHNNY
(to the children)
What do you think of havin a mama
thatd forget where we went on our
honeymoon

FRANCIE
Did you really go there mama

KATIE
Of course not papas joking

JOHNNY
Sure we did -- or just the same as
We spent our honeymoon in a school
was as big as a palace and--

KATIE
(interrupting)
We just worked there nights
cleanin the both of us It was
right here in Brooklyn before you
was born

JOHNNY
Well that wasnt what you said then
You mean to tell me when we was
havin our supper all alone there
and I used to pull down them maps and
take the teachers pointer and pick
out the places wed pretend we was
that night -- you mean to tell me we
really wasnt there You mean you
forgot that sunny France was where we
liked the best and all the laughin
we done there and you goin to sit
right there and tell me we wasnt
even there

He is making arrant love to her with this Katie is stirred

KATIE
(finding this
rather trying)
Yeah I guess we kind of was at
that

JOHNNY
And youre askin how I know about
the mountain fastnesses of France
Im ashamed of you Katie Nolan

Francie has been watching this between her father and mother

she doesnt quite understand the mood between them but she
is fascinated

FRANCIE
Wasnt there anybody in the school
but you papa

JOHNNY

No sir we--
KATIE
(interrupting)

Your papa better quit talkin hell
have you believin you was in France
too

FRANCIE
No talk some more papa--
NEELEY
Whats this here stuff

JOHNNY
Caviar thats fish eggs come all
the way from Russia

NEELEY
(appalled)
Fish eggs
JOHNNY

(as he and Katie laugh)
Tell the truth I never could get
the idea myself why they like it
except its hard to get and costs a
lot

FRANCIE
And that makes it good papa

NEELEY
What about the Russians -- it aint
hard for them to get -- do they like
it
JOHNNY
(to Katie)

Can you tie that aint we got the
smartest kids

FRANCIE
Papa talk some more tell us about
the party tonight dont leave out

JOHNNY
Oh that can wait
(he lays three
dollars before Katie)
Hows that

KATIE
Three dollars Thats good wages

JOHNNY
(jingling his pocket)
Good tips too

FRANCIE
Papa start Was there music Did
they dance

JOHNNY
Aw your mamas got no time for all
that
KATIE
(softly not
looking at him)
You -- you could tell me You used
to

Johnny starts uncertainly at first watching Katie Neeley
continues to eat Francie listens to her father with her
elbows on the table

JOHNNY
Well it was pretty swell Klommers
best room all fixed with white
flowers -- flowers on the table on
the chandeliers even on the floor
There was a big horseshoe table and
lots of people and right in front
was a big tall wedding cake must
have been two feet high

NEELEY
Why didnt you bring home some of
that

KATIE

Was the bride pretty

JOHNNY
Well she was maybe not so young
but--

Johnny cannot spoil a moment like this with the truth
Everything must be perfect so he improves on the bride a
little

JOHNNY
Sure she was awfully pretty in
that blue dress and all She had
diamonds on her hands and even in
her ears so she kind of glittered
and when she walked her clothes
swished kind of Well sir the
champagne flowed like water and
the smell of it got all mixed with
the flowers and the powder the
ladies wore and it was like a
wonderful new kind of perfume
made you feel good just to smell it

FRANCIE
(with a little
shiver of delight)
And did you sing for them papa

JOHNNY
Sure thing I was comin to that I
got three encores for My Wild
Irish Rose and -- everybody
clapped and clapped so I did Irish
Eyes Are Smiling four times

KATIE
It must have been awful nice

JOHNNY
It was all right And when it was
time to cut the wedding cake the
band played Kiss Me Again and she
put her arms around him and boy did
he look scared

NEELEY
What was he scared of papa

JOHNNY
Huh

KATIE
You kids ask too many questions Go
on you heard the story go back to
bed now it must be three oclock

NEELEY
(matter-of-factly)
I got a bellyache

KATIE
Lay on your right side

NEELEY
(kissing her)
Goodnight mom

KATIE
Goodnight Neeley

FRANCIE
(a little stiff --
not kissing Katie)
Goodnight mama

KATIE
Goodnight Francie

(laughing awkwardly)
Francies kind of mad at me because
Sissy made a scene of herself out on
the street and I -- I told her to
stay away

FRANCIE
Papa-—

KATIE
Run along now both of you

Both of the kids start to obey The small incident has
broken the perfection of the evening and this disturbs
Johnny

FRANCIE
Goodnight papa
(kissing him
then whispering)
Was -- was there an impresario
there

JOHNNY
Not tonight there wasnt Prima
Donna Come here

(awkwardly)
You got no call to be mad at your
mama Francie she -- she always got

a reason for what she does

Johnny means this Unaccustomed to reproof from Johnny even
as gentle as this is has its effect on Francie She
hesitates then goes over and kisses her mother with some
restraint Katie who is feeling more deeply than she has
felt in a long time holds her close for a moment Suddenly
Francie flings her arms around her mother and they are very
close for a moment

FRANCIE
(in a completely
different tone)
Goodnight mama

Francie hurries into her room and shuts the door Her going
makes a little awkward moment between Johnny and Katie who
are left alone each lost in his own thoughts

KATIE
(after another
little pause)
Johnny What else happened at the

party -- tell me

JOHNNY
Well it was nice like I said it
was awful nice -- the bride all

dressed up and all and--
But he cannot get going again And Katie hasnt really heard
KATIE
(interrupting)

Johnny

JOHNNY
Yeah
KATIE
Do you think-- I mean have I-- well
changed a lot-- you know

JOHNNY
(misunderstanding
-- quickly)
Changed why she couldnt holda
candle to you She wasnt so hot I
just said that for the kids No
sir youre--

KATIE
(interrupting)
No I mean -- am I gettin you know

hard
She is troubled inarticulate Johnny is bewildered

JOHNNY
Why whered you get hold of an idea
like that hard

KATIE
I dont know I dont want to be
but-- well theres the kids and all
I want to do whats good for them--
and maybe sometimes-—

JOHNNY

Aw baby dont talk like that Why
you know something youre prettier
than you ever was I could near
tellin it to the whole party
tonight-- hey you ought to see my
bride thats waitin home for me

(softly looking

straight at her)
And you was waitin That was --

nice Katie it was -- like it used
to be

KATIE
You -- you told about the party nice
Johnny I -- I shouldve waited up

more I guess

JOHNNY

Aw it aint your fault baby you
workin like you do

(he touches the comb)
I -- I wish Id bought you the rest
of that set when we was married the
man said it came all the way from
Spain
KATIE
What else was there to it You aint
told me for a long time

JOHNNY
There was two little side combs and
a locket on a chain

KATIE
And a bracelet you said

JOHNNY
You know what Im gonna look up
that man some day and get you the
rest of that set

Johnny is deeply moved This is the closest that he and
Katie have been in a long time If things were entirely
right between them most of all if they were entirely right
between Johnny and himself this is the moment in which he
would take her in his arms Subconsciously both of them
know it They enjoyed perfection when they were young
together as closely perhaps as people come to it Life
together when they were young was very right between them
This day has moved Katie to an instinctive reach back toward
that old perfection which they have not felt in a long time
This is what she is subconsciously asking from Johnny And
subconsciously he realizes this And because of his
failures he has not quite the feeling of this perfection
this completeness to give her This feeling is taut between
them for a moment And then Johnny feels instinctively the
necessity of talking a little more to try to reassure
himself to try to build with his words something more of
reassurance that everything is all right within him This
very feeling is an acknowledgment that he no longer has that
perfection to offer her So with his words they go past
the perfect moment Katie senses this There is a desperate
need in her for Johnny to take her in his arms without any
more words as he would do if their world were right She is
trying to hold on to this moment not to let it get by when
after a moment she speaks

KATIE
Thats nice Johnny but--

JOHNNY
(eagerly working
himself into believing)
Aint no buts about it I mean it
Things are goin to be different
around here you -- you got no
business workin like you do

KATIE
I dont mind the work I--

JOHNNY
He looks at her hurt amazed Katie has had all she can

stand

There is a long pause

facing But it is here
himself dies within him

No sir I aint goin to have it
Look at them pretty hands they got
no business bein in water all the
time Im goin to change a lot of
things Im goin to quit the
drinkin too And just to show you
heres my tip money you can--

KATIE
No Johnny the tips are yours --
you take all a mans money it aint
right

JOHNNY

(accepting this a

shade too easily)
Well theres a dime anyway I -- I
had to take a nickel out of the bank
for carfare you can put a dime back
But Im goin to keep at em down at
union headquarters and make em get
me jobs Tonights the beginning of
somethin new Katie -- you believe
me dont you Katie

KATIE
(wanting to)
Sure Johnny sure I do

JOHNNY
Ill be singin all over Brooklyn
and maybe Manhattan too Have you
heard Johnny Nolan sing theyll say
Yes sir our lucks turned and some
day--

KATIE
(from her heart)
Ah stop it Johnny stop it stop
talkin

It isnt any good its phony

KATIE
(bitterly)
Talkin like that only makes it
worse We aint got a chance who
are we tryin to kid

not possibly look at Katie in this moment

The truth that has been torn from
Katie is the last thing either of them wanted to face --
is the sort of thing people try the hardest to keep from
All Johnnys desperate effort to
He stares out the window

it

kid

He could
JOHNNY
(very quietly)
Yeah Thats right sure who am I
tryin to kid

Katie feels sorry for him for them both but there is no
use in weakening -- you can no longer evade the hard truth

KATIE
I didnt go to hurt you but its
the truth I cant change it
Johnny

JOHNNY
Yeah and I can tell you somethin
else too All that baloney about
the encores tonight -- that was just
because they was a little drunk and
feelin good I wasnt so hot

KATIE
(dry and hard)
No use talkin like that it wont
help any

JOHNNY
I dont know as long as were on
the truth lets keep lookin at it
Im the one ought to be kicked out
not Sissy I got a wife and kids and
I dont take care of ‘em I dont
know why I didnt want the kids
when they come but I love ‘em --
how could you help it -- sure I
love em a lot but I just cant
seem to turn into a hard-workin
man to take care of em What sense
does that make all I want to do is
sing I dont know why And I guess
thats right I aint ever goin to
be able to change it Sure youre
right who am I tryin to kid

This comes so quietly from Johnny that it is frightening
For the first time in his life he has faced himself Katie
made him do it even if she did not intend to They have
both faced him So these two will never again feel quite the
same about one another What he has said is bitterly true
there is no answer to it -- Katie slowly picks up some of
the dishes from the table as though she would take them to
the sink But even lifelong habit is no good and she sets
them back on the table

KATIE
(dully)
We better get some sleep
JOHNNY
(without turning)
Yeah

Katie stands helplessly a moment and then starts toward the
bedroom Johnny doesnt move

In the PARLOR Francie is lying on her bed beside the window
illumined by the faint moonlight She is awake staring at
the ceiling as if feeling a presentiment about the next
room Outside the window stands the Tree in the backyard
bereft of most of its branches but stark and strong in the
moonlight The scene fades out

C

MCGARRITYS SALOON fades in in the early morning It is a
small corner saloon Next to a big free lunch sign is a
cigar store with a wooden cigar store Indian -- McGarrity
the proprietor is just finishing sweeping the sidewalk

PASSING MAN
Morning Mac

McGarrity waves in answer and goes inside -- The place is
deserted except for Johnny who is sitting at a table head
down on his arms at a table Before him is a whiskey glass
and a litter of cigarettes McGarrity studies him
compassionately then goes over and shakes him gently by the
shoulder

MCGARRITY
Seven oclock Johnny better be
goin home

Johnny raises his head wearily He has not been asleep And
he is not as drunk as he would like to be although he has
tried hard to drink enough so that he would stop thinking

JOHNNY
(wearily)
Sure sure home
(singing)
Home is where the heart is--

He pulls himself to his feet and moves somewhat uncertainly
to the bar Automatically McGarrity goes behind the bar
and just as automatically wipes the polished surface

JOHNNY
(tonelessly)
Write nice songs about it dont
they Mac

MCGARRITY
Sure Johnny
JOHNNY
I sing em good too dont I Mac

MCGARRITY
Sure Johnny sure

JOHNNY
Dont just sure me like that Mac
Youre wrong about somethin you
dont know it but youre wrong Im
not ever goin home any more

MCGARRITY
Sure you are Johnny you got a
mighty nice family to go home to

JOHNNY
You dont get it Im goin there
Im gonna walk down the same street
Im gonna turn in the same door and
therell be my nice family but I
wont ever be goin home again Give
me a drink Mac

MCGARRITY
I dont get you boy

JOHNNY

Sure you dont I dont get it
either I pretty near did sittin
there thinkin about it Listen Mac

(singing)
Maxwelltons braes are bonnie
where early fas the dew--

(stopping)
What did you hear Mac

MCGARRITY
You always sing good if thats what
you mean

JOHNNY
If thats what I mean I dont know
what I mean What good is singing --
you feel somethin but there aint
nobody hears what you feel Its no
good -- she used to hear but not
any more So I wont ever be goin
home again I hate singin I
shouldve been tendin bar like you
Dont ever sing Mac

McGarrity studies Johnny closely He knows Johnny is in pain
about something but he isnt quite sure what

MCGARRITY
(polishing the bar)
Lots of angles to it boy You
wouldnt be any good tendin bar
Youre a funny fellow Johnny

JOHNNY
Sure sure Im funny I want a
drink Mac

MCGARRITY

I dont know if Id trade with you
-- a poet that cant write thats
bad But it takes all kinds of
people maybe some of em just
wasnt meant to make a livin And
maybe I would trade at that And
now you better get home to that nice
family your missus will be worryin

JOHNNY
(flaring up)
All right its the nicest family in
the world you think I dont know
that Give me a drink I said

MCGARRITY
Easy Johnny easy
(he sets out a drink)
Have one on the house

JOHNNY
(bitterly)
Sure thats better and Ill sing
for it thats what Ill do Ill
sing for it

McGarrity studies Johnny compassionately as Johnny pours the
drink Johnnys bitterness toward life and most of all his
hatred for himself and what he is is at its peak

The scene dissolves to the NOLAN TENEMENT as Francie emerges
with pencil box and books starting out for school Ina
moment the door bursts open and Neeley emerges always a
little late He has his books in a strap As he joins her
Neeley starts to rip off the tie he is supposed to wear to
school

FRANCIE
Neeley Nolan you stop that

NEELEY
Aw I dont want to wear no old tie
its--
FRANCIE
(maternally)

Mama said
NEELEY
Aw go chase yourself

But he submits to her mothering as she starts to pull the
tie back into place Suddenly they hear a clamor off scene
-- and we then see what they see Johnny drunk and unsteady
is just coming around the corner surrounded by a swarm of
derisive kids Johnny pays no attention to them

THE KIDS
Just pickle my bones in alcohol
Hes stiffer than a goat look how he
walks

Francie and Neeley run to their father Francie pushes her
way to him and tries to take his arm

FRANCIE
(fiercely)
You leave him alone Papa -- come

on lets go home lets hurry papa
Johnny tries uncertainly to smile but he is pretty far gone

NEELEY
(to the kids)
You leave him alone or Ill bust you
one

The kids pay no attention Neeley socks one of them anda
fight is on Francie tries desperately to help Johnny toward
their door

McShane enters from across the street and breaks up the
fight

MCSHANE
(to the kids)
Come on now quit it -- quit it or

Ill run you in Beat it now

The kids break and beat it still yelling derisively
Francie and Neeley remain and McShane turns back to them

MCSHANE
Now my lad where do you live

FRANCIE
(fiercely)
Ill take him home hes my father

MCSHANE
I expect youd best be gettin on to
school hadnt you Ill look after
him for you
(Francie hesitates
Dont you worry he aint in any
trouble Ill take good care of him
This the building

FRANCIE
(nodding)
Second floor back If -- if you talk
to him he -- hes always all right
and youll--
MCSHANE

Dont you fret a minute
(he takes Johnnys arm)
Come on now -- well make it lad

Johnny gives him a blurred look but submits to being led up
the steps and as Francie stands looking after them
miserable the scene dissolves to the TENEMENT HALL where
McShane helps Johnny toward the Nolan door Johnny only
half-coherently tries to sing

JOHNNY
When Irish eyes are smiling--

MCSHANE
Quiet now quiet does it

JOHNNY
Got to sing dont you very
important and shell hear you but
you got to sing ju-u-st right so
she can get the door open first
very important

MCSHANE
All right sing then if it eases
whats hurtin you

JOHNNY
When Irish eyes are smiling--

The noise causes a couple of neighbors who open their doors
to look out McShane knocks at the Nolan door and Katie
appears just ready to start her mornings janitor work
McShane is surprised to see her

KATIE
Johnny

Scarcely noticing McShane she starts to help Johnny into
the kitchen McShane helps -- The scene cuts to the KITCHEN
as they get Johnny into a chair at the table McShane
studies Katie who is busy with Johnny

MCSHANE
I -- I didnt -- I didnt expect to
see you maam Is there anything I
can do

KATIE
Hes my husband I can take care of
him
(to Johnny)

Its all right now Johnny Ill get
you a nice cup of coffee

JOHNNY
(blurred)
Nice cup of coffee nice cup of
coffee

Katie goes to the stove McShane stands awkwardly for a
moment

MCSHANE
I just wanted to tell you the
gentleman wasnt makin no trouble
just -- needed a little help

Katie stops pouring the coffee to look at him She is
instinctively defensive about Johnny so her look is
antagonistic at any intrusion into their family troubles

MCSHANE
(awkwardly)
If -- if theres anything I can do
ma‘ am-—

Katie comes over and puts the coffee down in front of Johnny

KATIE
There Johnny drink it
(then turning to McShane)
If you wasnt new on the beat Mr
McShane youd know Johnny never

makes trouble -- and youd know the
whole Nolan family dont need
anybodys help and -- and Id thank

you very much Mr McShane to mind
your own business

Her eyes meet his squarely

MCSHANE
(after a moment)
Sure -- Mrs Nolan

He turns and goes closing the door behind him Katie turns
to Johnny

Out in the HALL McShane pauses a moment beside the door and
looks back toward the room a little ruefully He sure caught
hell He grins in admiration then starts down the stairs
The scene dissolves to the PUBLIC SCHOOL The school yard is
swarming with children The bell is ringing and the
youngsters start to form lines to march in This dissolves
to the EIGHTH GRADE CLASSROOM The view is focused on one
group and then moves past the intent struggling faces of
other children as they recite in unison with a curious

cadence with which poetry is scanned

KIDS
Beau-ty is truth truth beau-ty that
is all Ye know on earth and all ye
need to know

The camera comes to Neeley and then Francie then pulls
back to reveal a classroom so crowded that some of the
children have to sit in the aisles in chairs without desks

The teacher MISS TILFORD middle-aged and tired

is at the

blackboard marking off with chalk the metric divisions of
the lines which are written on the board Miss Tilford is

repeating it with them

MISS TILFORD
(as they finish)

Now who knows the name of the meter
(looking at the class
Francies hand is up)

Frances Nolan

FRANCIE
(standing up)
Yes but--

MISS TILFORD
You cant know but You either
know or you dont know

FRANCIE
I know its iambic pentameter five
metric feet with a long syllable
coming after a short one but-- I
only meant to say-- I was thinking
about the words what they mean
and I wondered--

MISS TILFORD
You dont have to know the words
Frances only the meter And were
late now for our arithmetic The
class will get their arithmetic
books

She moves to the desk There is a general rustle in the
class as the exchange of books is made Francie sits down

slowly

MISS TILFORD
(opening her book)
Now then The farmer has a hundred
and sixty-nine apples in a barrel
He wants to divide them into equal
piles with as many apples in each
pile as there are piles of apples
How would he go about it

(as there is no

answer she goes on)

What method would he use -- What is
the latest process weve been
studying

FRANCIE

(with hand raised)
Miss Tilford--

MISS TILFORD
Yes Frances

FRANCIE

(rising)
If beauty is truth and thats all ye
need -- I mean all you need to know
-- Then that means its the most
important thing and if a man -- I
mean somebody -- spent all their
time just trying to live like that
-- Well its hard to put but no
matter what else he did then --
then --

She falters feeling strongly what she wants to say but
unable to say it Neeley knows what she is getting at

MISS TILFORD
Then what Frances

FRANCIE
(lamely)
Then -- it would be all right
wouldnt it -- I guess

MISS TILFORD
Im afraid I havent the slightest
idea what youre talking about
Frances but I do know were
disrupting the arithmetic Now
class Square root Does no one
remember square root

As Francie sits down deeply humiliated the scene dissolves
to the CLASSROOM while the children are filing past a doctor
and a nurse who examine briefly the head of each child
looking for lice As they finish the children are free to
leave Francie and Neeley are in line The doctor is
examining a boy and indicates for the nurse to look
DOCTOR
Report to your principal and give
him this card

The boy goes on with the card nonchalantly but as he leaves
some kids who successfully passed the examination jeer

KIDS
Mickeys lousy Mickeys lousy

Neeley next in line submits indifferently and dashes to
his cronies as soon as the doctor murmurs All right
Francie steps up She offers her head enduring the
examination as a necessary evil but clearly knowing it

is not necessary in her case Miss Tilford checking the
line observes her

DOCTOR
All right

He has turned to the next child and misses Francies
scornful glance -- as much as to say I know that -- but
Miss Tilford sees it and suddenly feels a compunction

MISS TILFORD
(as Francie passes her)
Frances

FRANCIE
Yes Miss Tilford

MISS TILFORD
Er -- maybe I was a little too
abrupt with you this morning -- I
mean you are a smart girl and --
its just that you must learn to
stick to the point and not go
wandering off the subject

FRANCIE
Yes Miss Tilford

MISS TILFORD
If youll do that you neednt worry
about passing

FRANCIE
I wasnt worrying about--
(giving up meekly)
Yes Miss Tilford thank you Miss
Tilford

As she wanders out completely lost the scene dissolves to
the SCHOOLYARD Neeley has waited for Francie and they are
now walking across the yard toward the gate Francie is
vaguely troubled
NEELEY

How should I know if they knew you
was talkin about him I dont see
what for you want to talk so much
anyway Pop was just a little drunk
that dont hurt nobody

(he breaks off as

he sees something

offscene)
Hey look

We then see SISSY from their angle waiting at the corner
for them She waves -- The children stop short ina
quandary

NEELEY
Whatll we do We aint supposed to
talk to her

FRANCIE
(troubled)
I dont know--
(she has an idea)
Neeley thats all they said we
was only supposed not to talk to
her

Neeleys face brightens Francie hurries toward Sissy and
Neeley follows

Sissy embraces them both and doesnt notice their silence

SISSY
Chickabiddies I couldnt stand it
no longer I just had to get a peek
Man alive you both look good enough
to eat

NEELEY
Gee its--

Francie shakes her head warningly Sissy doesnt notice

SISSY

Well how are you anyway

(no answer --

Francie stares at

her miserably)

Tell me all about it hows things

at home

(theres a

miserable

silence)
Well youre not lettin me get a
word in edgewise Oh -- I catch

You aint allowed to talk to me
huh

(they nod -- she
laughs and hugs
them)

Well you do just like your mama
said But there aint nobody said
anything about me talkin to you
is that it
(they nod and
shake their
heads in happy
confusion)
Smart enough for lawyers
of you Well lets see
and shake and make faces
Hows Katie
(they nod)
And your papa
(they hesitate
nod uncertainly)
Not workin much
(they shake their
heads sadly)

the both
you can nod
cant you

then

Well dont you worry he will
(they nod then
tentatively)

Any sign of the ice meltin in my

direction yet

(they shrug and Sissy

sighs humorously)
Guess Ill have to tell Bill you
still got scarlet fever hes kinda
wonderin Oh well And hows
school

There is a divided opinion on this

that its okay enough but to hell with it

Neeleys shrug implies

has revived Francies problem
troubled

Sissys interest centers on her

SISSY
Whats wrong aint you doin
(Francie shakes
her head)
got in any trouble
(there is a
confused shrug)
Teacher mean to you
(theres a division
of opinion -- a half-
hearted negative from
Francie a nod from
Neeley Sissy is
puzzled)
I dont get it lamb somethins
troubling you maybe I aint askin
the right questions

good

Well

But the question

and her shake of the head is
Francie looks at her miserably wanting terribly to talk to
Sissy to someone about it For a moment the scene is at an
impasse Then Francie has an idea

FRANCIE
Neeley
(he looks at her)
Neeley Aunt Sissy wants to know if
its because the teachers mean to
us

NEELEY
Sure she is she--

Francie touches his arm shakes her head indicates that he
is to talk to her not Sissy The great light dawns on
Neeley

NEELEY
Oh -- was you speakin to me
Francie Why yes Francie Id say
that teacher was pretty mean
wouldnt you Francie Id say all
teachers was pretty mean Francie

FRANCIE
(as Sissy grins at
this subterfuge)
Well Neeley I wouldnt say that
she was mean exactly That isnt
what we mean Neeley is it

NEELEY
Aint it Francie

FRANCIE
No what we mean is Neeley
schools to learn things in thats
what its for isnt it and if you
got questions--

NEELEY
Well now look Francie -- if you
mean all that talkin you did about
pop then I dont know--

FRANCIE
Neeley Nolan you dont understand
anything You got to know things if
theyre important thats what
schools for isnt it Its just if
shed tell you things not just the
meter but what they mean thats what
teachers ought to do -- Isnt it
Neeley
NEELEY

(giving up)

Well Francie
youre talkin

maybe you know what
about but if you ask

me you just talk but dont say

nothin’

But Neeley--

FRANCIE

SISSY

(gently)

Its all right

lamb I cant say I

could draw a map of it but I get

some of it

(she draws
Francie to her)
You quit worryin about it hon and

run along home

Maybe your old Aunt

Sissy can do somethin about it
(she hugs them
both tightly)

Look maybe it

s just as well if you

dont say nothin at home about
seein’ me -- you know it aint lyin
as long as nobody asks you

NEELEY

(lightly)
I guess we cant help it Francie
if people listen to us in the street

He is off like a shot
smiles gratefully into
a moment and then her
Francie suffer because
other reason whatever
school

The scene dissolves to
belligerently in front

calling to a group of boys Francie
Sissys eyes Sissy watches after her
face hardens Nobody is going to make
of her fathers weakness or for any
it may be She starts toward the

a CLASSROOM Sissy is standing
of a bewildered Miss Tilfords desk

SISSY

(belligerently)
What Im sayin is whatever it is
youre teachin the other kids that
Francie aint gettin -- I aint
gonna have it

MISS TILFORD
But I assure you that your daughter
is being taught exactly the same as
the other children If you could
just tell me what it is that you
mean-—

SISSY
(interrupting humbly)
Look lady I dont know myself what
were talkin about I aint very
smart I guess you seen that But
somethins eatin that kid and
shes a good kid and dont you hold
out nothin on her dont you teach
the other kids nothin she aint
gettin or--

(confused)
Well you see that you do like I
said

(she attempts

belligerence again)
Or Ill call a cop and that aint
kiddin either I used to be married
to one

With this last lame threat she stalks out leaving Miss
Tilford shaking her head in relief as though at a lunatic
who hasnt affected her at all

e scene dissolves to the NOLAN KITCHEN where we get a
lose view of the Sunday funny paper spread on the floor

e text is the Katzenjammer Kids This dissolves to a full
iew of the kitchen to show Neeley sprawled on the floor
ith the funny paper Francie is quietly staring out the
indow preoccupied drumming on it idly Katie enters from
e hall with a few clothes over her arm that she has just
rought in from the line to be ironed She stops abruptly
en she doesnt see Johnny in the room Her question
carries quick instinctive apprehension that Johnny may have
gone out to get drunk again

Sots edc ban

KATIE
Wheres your papa did he go out

NEELEY
Nom he--

Johnny appears from the bedroom He has heard
JOHNNY

(with quiet bitterness)
No he didnt go out

KATIE
Oh I thought--
JOHNNY
(quietly)

I aint goin to McGarritys if
thats what you mean

(to Francie)
Thems fine compositions -- they
read nice Prima Donna
FRANCIE
(absently)
Thank you papa

Johnny has the compositions in his hand He goes over to the
table and puts them down He isnt looking at Katie This
Sunday is a hard day for Johnny With what has happened
between him and Katie it is very difficult to be shut in
these small quarters with his family with something dead
between them Life is at low ebb for Johnny He picks up a
piece of the newspaper and studies it absently to avoid
looking at Katie Katie studies him for a second She too
is aware of the tension but life has to go on She puts the
clothes into her work basket and starts to mend some of them
There is a little silence

NEELEY
(quite unaware
of all this)
Pop why dont the Katzenjammer Kids
talk plain English

JOHNNY
Supposed to make it funny I guess

KATIE
Francie you been staring out that
window for half an hour Cant you
make up your mind to do something

FRANCIE
What shall I do

KATIE
You used to like to do your homework
Sundays

FRANCIE
I -- I dont know I dont like

school as much as I used to

NEELEY
Now youre gettin some sense

KATIE
Schools just the same this year as
it was last

FRANCIE
Mama

KATIE
Yes

FRANCIE

You know that big market on Clancy
Street down the hill
KATIE
We cant deal there if thats what
you mean That neighborhoods

expensive

FRANCIE
Well I wasnt talking about the
market

KATIE

You said did I know that market
Neeley dont just lie there and
scuff your shoes out

FRANCIE
Well I meant the other day I
walked home that way and -- and do

you know whats just a couple of
blocks away from that market

KATIE
Another market I guess and am I
supposed to guess whats two blocks
away from that Why dont you say
what you mean Francie

FRANCIE
(discouraged)
I didnt mean anything I guess

From behind his paper Johnny gives her a quick look He
knows Francie has something on her mind and is getting no
place with it He is very much aware of the unconscious duel
between the two

KATIE
Sometimes it looks like you make
these holes on purpose Neeley

NEELEY
(grinning)

Aw can I help it if things just
happen

FRANCIE
Papa

JOHNNY
Yes baby

FRANCIE
You know what I read in a magazine
once

JOHNNY

(getting a look
from Katie)
What was it Francie

FRANCIE

Well it said walking is a good
thing it said people would look and
feel better if they walked a lot
Walk and put rose petals in your
cheeks it said

KATIE
Then I ought to be a ravin beauty
with all those stairs

Francie wanders over to her fathers chair and stands in
back of it As she talks it is clear it is for his benefit

FRANCIE
It didnt mean that It meant --
Well like on a Sunday people would
feel lots better if they took a long
walk or something instead of just
sitting around and--

KATIE
Francie I want you to stop talkin
around things like that It aint
right If you got somethin to say
I want you to say it right out
plain

FRANCIE
(defeated starting
back to the window)
I wasnt going to say anything I
was just talking about walking

Johnny from behind his paper shoots a quick look at Katie
and then at Francie He lays down his paper gets to his
feet and stretches himself When he speaks it is indirectly
a reproof to Katie

JOHNNY
Been so much talk about walkin I
think Ill take one Come along
Prima Donna

Francies face lights up but she restrains herself quickly

FRANCIE
Oh yes sure papa

Johnny grins at her and starts to pick up his coat As Katie
looks sharply at him the scene dissolves to a STREET in a
BETTER NEIGHBORHOOD Francie and Johnny are walking together
She has hold of his arm proudly
JOHNNY
(teasing)
Must be pretty special this place
you walk to thats two blocks froma
market

FRANCIE
This way papa

They come to a corner and Francie stops Johnny looks around
but cant make out just what it is

JOHNNY
Is this it Prima Donna

FRANCIE
(shyly)
Yes papa

Johnny looks where she points and we next see the new
school from their angle It is a long way from being the
best school you ever saw but it is different from the old
one -- a bigger yard a few trees less dingy Johnny looks
from the school back to Francie It doesnt make sense
somehow

JOHNNY
The school
(Francie can only nod)
I dont get it baby

FRANCIE
(hesitantly)
It must be just as nice inside
dont you think The teachers and
all and--

She falters to a stop

JOHNNY
(gently)
What are you gettin at Prima
Donna

Francie cant look at him It is such a hard thing to
explain even to papa Her reply is almost a whisper

FRANCIE
Bend down papa
(he does)
I wish I could go to that school
papa

The strange intensity of her feelings touches Johnny He
doesnt want to let her down but he doesnt know quite what
to do about it He puts his arm around her
JOHNNY
I dont know It would be awful nice
but they got rules honey you got
to go to the school where you live

Francies face falls She knew that this was the answer

FRANCIE
I know I didnt really--

She cant go on

JOHNNY
(he cant stand it)
Wait a minute maybe theres a way
its a free country aint it
(as he sings)
School days school days-- Maybe
we could move near to here

FRANCIE
(like a shot)
When

JOHNNY
(taken aback)
Well not just yet Prima Donna not
for a while But just as soon as our
ship comes in youll see

FRANCIE
(let down)
Oh only by that time Ill--

JOHNNY
You want to go there awful bad
dont you baby
(Francie nods)
Then look were goin to finda
way

FRANCIE
Honest

JOHNNY
Well now Ive got to turn this
thing over some Lets us doa
little more walkin its -- maybe
its good for thinkin too

With complete faith in this Francie takes his arm again and
as they start to walk the scene dissolves to a RESIDENCE
STREET composed of small houses fairly attractive Johnny
and Francie come down the sidewalk They are walking slowly

JOHNNY
(making conversation)
Thats not a bad house howd you
like to live there Nice little
porch

FRANCIE
(shaking her head)
I dont like brown houses

JOHNNY
Well maybe a coat of paint

FRANCIE
(seeing the next house)
Oh papa
(Johnny looks Francie
goes on)
Thats it

Johnny looks and we get a view of the next house -- small
white a neat white fence and flowers

JOHNNY
Yes sir thats it

FRANCIE
If we only could

JOHNNY
Well why cant we Our lucks bound
to turn and the first thing well
do is buy that little house when--
(lamely)
some day

The fairy tale is back and Francies elation is gone
Johnny looks at her cornered

JOHNNY

(in desperation)
Look as long as were goin to buy
that house some day why cant we
maybe borrow it for now Like -- say
we make out its ours then your
address is--

(looking)
98 Hibbard Avenue -- startin right
now Then you see you got to
transfer from your old school

FRANCIE
(it is too much to
understand all at once)
How do you mean papa

JOHNNY
Thats it We could say you come
here to live with your aunt your
rich old aunt Shes lonely and
shes goin to leave you all her
money

FRANCIE
Oh papa could we really

JOHNNY
Sure we could its nobodys
business And every day you eat off
real china dishes with little
cherries painted onto em and when
you drink coffee you have a cup and
saucer to match and a plate too
like they come from a restaurant

FRANCIE
(ecstatic)
Sometimes I forget to water the
geraniums and you ought to hear
Auntie scold me

JOHNNY
You got to put up with her crotchets
-- after all youre her heir

FRANCIE
(pointing)
That -- that could be my room up
there where the little window is

Johnny watching her suddenly becomes troubled by the
enormity of what he is doing

JOHNNY
Now look Prima Donna you know what
were doin aint exactly accordin
to the rules

FRANCIE
(fearfully)
You mean its wrong

JOHNNY
Not by a jugful it aint wrong See
the house is here and were here

and the school -- we wasnt all
brought together like this just for
no reason But well have to

keep it a kind of secret you wont
be able to tell anybody and youll
have to be extra good to make up for
it

FRANCIE
(relieved)
Oh I will
(she looks around)
I think here comes auntie now

An elderly man and woman coming down the street turn in at
the gate They are very nice looking

JOHNNY

(whispering)
I see you got an uncle too

(they both laugh

everything is settled)
Now Im goin to show you a way to
your new school through a little
park I know right where it is and
you can see the seasons change on
your way

He has taken her by the arm and they are moving again down
the street

FRANCIE
(trying to speak)
Papa -- bend down
(but she is too
moved for mortal
words)
My cup runneth over

Her eyes glisten softly

The scene dissolves to the NOLAN KITCHEN at night Francie
is helping Katie with the dishes but hovering over Johnny
who is laboriously writing a letter on the kitchen table
Across from him Neeley scowls over his homework

KATIE
Its dishonest thats what it is
Youre settin the child an awful
bad example

FRANCIE
Papa says if it doesnt hurt anybody
and youre not dishonest in your
heart--—

KATIE
You two with your fancy words --

JOHNNY
(paying no attention)
How you spell transfer Prima
Donna

FRANCIE
T-r-a-n-s-f-e-r

NEELEY
Id ruther be shot than do this
arithmetic

KATIE

(mechanically)
Itll come to you sonny And
another thing We kept Francie out a
year sos she and Neeley could be in
the same class sos she could look
after him and here just the year
theyre gettin ready to graduate
you go and--

(she breaks off

exasperated)
Its against the law and its makin
her live a lie and -- I wont have

you doin it

Johnny stops writing For the first time he turns and looks
squarely at her speaking very quietly

JOHNNY
Im goin to do this for her Katie
Maybe its my fault or not there

aint much I can give her -- but
this is one thing shes goin to
have

There is a pause Katie is surprised by his firmness She is
the first to falter

KATIE

(yielding)
Itll make an awful long walk for
you mornings

FRANCIE
(with a gleam of hope)
I dont mind gettin up early

KATIE
Itll be lots harder on your shoes
and you wont have dresses like the
other children

FRANCIE
Ill wash and iron my dress every
single night

JOHNNY
(writing again with
a funny little smile)
How do you spell appreciate
Francie

FRANCIE
A-p-p-r-e-c-i-a-t-e
KATIE
(awkwardly)
If the principal of the school
swallows that story -- which I dont
think he will -- Ill see what I can
do about makin over that checked
dress of mine

Katie goes on washing the dishes to cover her surrender
Francies face is radiant Johnny smiles a little to himself
as he writes

The scene dissolves to the PRINCIPALS OFFICE where Francie
is standing anxiously before the principal as he reads
Johnnys note At length he looks up from the note

PRINCIPAL
Why not My schools overcrowded as
it is

Francie smiles tremulously It is almost too good to be true
-- This dissolves to FRANCIES LITTLE HOUSE Francie her
coat over the new plaid dress approaches the little house
She pauses near the gate looks in It is a miracle this
little house of hers She sees a scrap of paper anda
broken dead flower stem inside the fence Making sure no one
is looking she slips through and picks these up It is her
gesture of serving the little house As she starts out the
gate again her manner changes and for a fleeting moment she
has the job of pretense that it is really hers and she is
emerging to start to school She walks through the gate with
something of the manner of a princess The gate squeaks a
little She tries it again

FRANCIE
(proprietary)
Dear me I must remember to oil that
gate

As she goes on down the street completely happy the scene
dissolves to a CLASSROOM in the NEW SCHOOL The room is
different less crowded cleaner Class has just taken up
Miss McDonough the teacher is standing beside her desk
her arm around Francies shoulder

MISS MCDONOUGH

This is Frances Nolan class Im
sure youll all make her welcome to
our school Now this will be your
desk Frances

(she takes Francie

to the desk)
And one more thing Frances Dont
worry about marks at first Ive
told the class often it isnt the
marks that count its the knowledge
that you make your own that you
make forever and forever a part of
you Now you may go to your desk

Miss McDonough turns to her desk Francie stands a second
For a moment it is too good to be true Then she slips down
into the desk It is hers She begins to smile

The scene dissolves to the NOLAN KITCHEN where we first see
Francie ironing her school dress as she talks She is
thrilled over her first day at the new school Then the
scene pulls back to reveal Johnny and Katie also in the
kitchen Katie is laying the table for supper Johnny is
finishing getting dressed to go out on another job

FRANCIE
And oh Miss McDonough is just
wonderful She said we could choose
anything in the world to write this
composition about just anything
She said it was good for us to
choose our own subject

JOHNNY
Well thats mighty fine Prima
Donna What did you decide on

FRANCIE
She said itd be nice if we wrote
about something in nature But we
dont know much about nature do we

papa

JOHNNY
Well your trees nature

FRANCIE
But just one tree for a composition
itd be awful short What else is
nature

JOHNNY
Grass wind dogs -- why dont you
write about a dog

FRANCIE
Are dogs nature

JOHNNY
Sure

FRANCIE
But Id like this to be kind of a --
special composition She was so
wonderful

JOHNNY
Through this
preparations for the meal

Katie
have given Francie this odd gift
little resentment of the closeness between father and

Ill tell you what then -- what am I
doin tonight but goin to sea on
the good ship Governor Clinton and
the oceans nature aint it Ill
keep an eye on the sea tonight and
tell you all about that

daughter None of it is lost on her

KATIE
Bein a waiter on a little excursion
boat goin up the Hudson River aint
exactly goin to sea

JOHNNY
Sure it is its a kind of a sea
its water Ill remember everything
about it so you can write about the
bright blue sea Prima Donna Hows
that

FRANCIE
I think that would be kind of
special

KATIE
(drily)
Your Miss McDonough bein so
wonderful she didnt happen to
mention where our supper was comin
from tonight did she

NEELEY
(appearing suddenly from
his bedroom on cue)
Did you say supper mom Im hungry

KATIE
There aint much sonny But maybe
we can fill out with one o them
compositions about the bright blue
sea

JOHNNY
Prima Donna you know what -- this
ought to be extra special for your
new school You know what were goin
to do

FRANCIE
What papa

Katie busies herself with the scanty

Johnny is getting a warm glow out
of Francies happiness over the new school that he has given
nows deep inside herself that she never would

so there is an instinctive
JOHNNY
If theres tips enough on this job
tonight come Sunday Im goin to
take you to see the ocean for
yourself

FRANCIE
The really ocean

NEELEY
Me too pop

JOHNNY
You bet It aint right livin this
close and you never even seen it
People ought--

KATIE
(sharply)
Johnny
JOHNNY
Yeah
KATIE

(changing her mind)

Nothing Maybe at that its better
than that McGarrity gettin your tip
money

JOHNNY
Yeah I get it -- I -- I wasnt
thinkin

(to the children)
Sure your mamas right we better
get a little bread and bacon in that
old cupboard before we go to takin
fishin trips But well go one of
these days when-- well you wait
and see

(he takes his hat)
Well this aint earnin the family
bread

(ready to go grateful

to escape this)
Neednt wait up If I know the
Governor Clinton I wont be bringin
home no caviar Goodnight my
hearties

FRANCIE
Goodnight papa

NEELEY
Goodnight pop
JOHNNY
Ill keep an eye out good Prima
Donna and tell you all about it

He is gone There is an odd little tension in the room for
a moment Katie sets the last things on the table

KATIE
All right men step right up and
get your rations

NEELEY
Oh golly mom you mean we got to
play North Pole again

KATIE
(quickly)
I couldnt help it son there wasnt
a penny in the pitcher

FRANCIE
Look you can be captain Neeley
and when we find the Pole you can
drive in the stake with your name on
it

The children sit down and Katie pours the coffee What food
there is is on the table -- a heel of bread a bit of cold
potato cracker crumbs

NEELEY
(glumly)
Gosh even caviar would look good
lookin at that stuff

FRANCIE
My fish from Alaskan waters and
chopped Eskimo whale

KATIE
(bitterly)
Thats right knowin about all them
ocean things sure helps to keep you
from feelin hungry dont it

NEELEY
Id rather think about all that free
lunch down at McGarritys Mom how
much longer do I got to be a minor

KATIE
You aint ever goin to start takin
anything from that place

FRANCIE
I bet papall bring home some swell
food nice rolls and--
NEELEY

Aw quit it Mom -- Im hungry

Steady

KATIE
captain

Neeleys eyes meet hers and he gets hold of himself and
gulps some coffee

FRANCIE
(watching this)

Mama youd rather do anything than
break into the star bank wouldnt

you

KATIE

Just about Bein a little hungry
aint never as bad if you know you
got a little somethin in the bank

Mama

FRANCIE

(Katie looks at her)

When explorers get hungry theres

a reason something big comes out of
it like they discover the North
Pole But whats the big thing comes
out of us bein hungry

KATIE
(wearily)

You found the catch in it Francie

(then ashamed of
admitting it)

Aw thats no way to talk Sure
somethin comes out of it Courage

my men

the Spring thaws will be

here before you know it

She roughs Neeleys hair affectionately as she goes to get
some more coffee The scene fades out

D

The BEDROOM CLOSET fades in Katie is prying the star bank

loose Neeley
watches avidly

loaded down with blankets and frying pans

KATIE

Run along sonny -- I aint goin
to spill a penny

She slides a paper under the bank lifts it and wraps it
quickly in a dish towel keeping her word They go out
through the now bare bedroom
The scene cuts to the KITCHEN which is empty of everything
but the stove The Nolan bedstead is just going through the
door borne out by Charlie whose cap bears the simple
legend Ice

KATIE
(taking a last
look around)
I guess we got everything

Out in the HALL Charlie carrying the bed up and Mr
Crackenbox carrying a trunk down have difficulty passing
each other on the stairs and Katie and Neeley have to wait
A humble bit of crepe hangs on the Gaddis door Katie
straightens it

KATIE
Poor Flossie

A couple of women tenants peer out their doors at the moving

FIRST WOMAN
Johnny aint doin too well eh
Mrs Nolan

KATIE
(starting up
the stairs)
Just movin nearer to the sun
Soons we heard Mrs Waters was
vacatin we made up our minds

She goes on up determinedly with Neeley

Next on the FOURTH FLOOR Francie is seen leaning excitedly
over the banister as Charlie struggles up the last of the
stairs and through the door of a rear flat just over the
Nolans old one

FRANCIE
Neeley our new fire escape leads
right up onto the roof

NEELEY
(coming up)
Whoever lives on the top floor gets
dibs on the roof

As Katie follows him up Mrs Waters the vacating tenant
comes out of the flat and addresses her anxiously The
children fly into the flat

MRS WATERS
I been waitin for you Mrs Nolan
Theres somethin I got to ask you
-- a favor I -- I better show you
She leads the way into the KITCHEN of the NEW FLAT This is
a little smaller darker meaner Some of the Nolan
belongings are in place some in a tangle Mrs Waters leads
Katie to the parlor Francie and Neeley climb in the window
from the fire escape and follow The scene cuts to the
PARLOR which is empty of furniture except for a small
old-fashioned upright piano Mrs Waters touches it
lovingly

MRS WATERS
The late Mr Waters gave it to me
for a wedding present It wont go
down the stairs and they want
fifteen dollars to move it lowerin
it out the window Do you mind my
leavin it Mrs Nolan It dont
take much room and some day when
I get the fifteen dollars Ill send
back for it

KATIE
(touched)
Why sure I dont mind Mrs Waters

FRANCIE
(to Mrs Waters)
Can you play it

MRS WATERS

No neither one of us could

(to Katie)
And if it aint too much trouble
you could dust it off once ina
while and leave the kitchen door
open a little so it wont get cold
or damp

KATIE
Sure I will And I hope it wont be
long until you can send back for it

She follows Mrs Waters out and both children cross their
fingers instantly showing they dont share their mothers
hope Then reverently each strikes a note

The scene cuts to the KITCHEN as Mr Crackenbox comes out of
the smaller bedroom carrying the last of Mrs Waters
possessions topped by a small cheap old bassinet Mrs
Waters is about to follow him out when Katie sees the
bassinet (Charlie is heard putting up the bedstead in the
bedroom )

KATIE
Mrs Waters That -- that -- is it
a

MRS WATERS
(smiling)
Yeah we kept the baby in it --
about thirty years ago

KATIE
(with difficulty)
I was just thinkin if you dont
need it Make a nice handy

little washbasket Id be glad to
give you a quarter for it

MRS WATERS
(looking at
her curiously)
Why sure My Edgars kids is even
too old

Tenderly the two lift the thing down and Mr Crackenbox
goes out with the rest of the load Katie gets a quarter out
of the bank then quickly wraps it up again

MRS WATERS
(touching her softly)
Excuse me for askin Mrs Nolan
but-- it wont really make a very
handy washbasket

Their eyes meet

KATIE
(nodding quietly)
Please dont say nothin I -- I
aint told nobody yet

MRS WATERS
(with deep feeling)
I know it aint always easy when
youre poor but-- itll be a
blessin to you

KATIE
(very low)
Yes sure -- sure it will--

The children starting to run in rouse her and she nods a
hasty farewell to Mrs Waters as she hurries with the
bassinet into the bedroom Mrs Waters understands and goes

NEELEY
(gleefully to Francie)
I tell you there aint--

He runs into the smaller bedroom as Katie comes back
carrying only the bank Charlie emerges sweating

FRANCIE
(in a low tone)
Dont forget were supposed to give
him a beer -- or the price of one

Charlie wipes his sweating brow significantly hopefully

CHARLIE
Im done

KATIE
I cant thank you enough Charlie

CHARLIE
Always glad to do my customers a
favor of course

He doesnt move

KATIE
(firmly)
Were real grateful Charlie

CHARLIE
It aint as though I was in the
regular movin business

KATIE
Well be takin ice once a week
same as usual

CHARLIE
(after a pause grimly)
Well goodbye

KATIE
Goodbye Charlie

He goes out slamming the door Francie looks reproachfully

FRANCIE
He worked awful hard Mama

KATIE
(hardening)
We moved to this flat to save money
Were not goin to make a start by
throwin away dimes

NEELEY
(entering joyfully)
No-sir there aint a bathtub
anywhere I looked all over

Katie grins leads him to the kitchen sink and lifts out a
partition by which a tub can be improvised

KATIE
Thats the tub young man -- every
Saturday and Wednesday same as
always

A knock causes Katie to breathe Mr Barker She sets the
bank down and quickly puts her hand to her hair as Francie
opens the door Mr Barker enters looking around for
gossip

MR BARKER
Well seems like the Nolans have
come up in the world

He means down

FRANCIE
(glibly like Katie)
Yes were so very very fond of the
sunshine

KATIE
(polite but hasty)
Sorry I cant ask you to sit Mr
Barker I aint even got the coffee
on yet But I got the insurance
money handy

She reaches in her pocket

MR BARKER
(taking out his pen)
Smallern your old flat aint it

Suddenly Johnnys voice singing Molly Malone is heard

KATIE
(quickly to Neeley)
Run down and catch him before he
goes in the old place
(to Mr Barker defensively)
Mr Nolan happened to be -- working
when we found we could make the move

Neeley goes out

MR BARKER
(dubiously)
I suppose youre too busy to listen
to a bit of news -- about your sister

(he pauses for effect)
Shes goin to have a baby

Katie stares After a moment she speaks

KATIE
(quickly)
Tell her -- please tell my sister
she shouldnt make herself such a
stranger

MR BARKER
(in his best manner)
I shall be very happy to render your
message Your receipts Mrs Nolan

FRANCIE
(delighted)
Be sure to now Mr Barker

Johnny appears in the doorway with Neeley He is a little
bewildered by the move cant say anything to Mr Barker

MR BARKER
Good day to you Mr Nolan Well
Im not one to spoil a family party
Ill be on my way

He scurries out Johnny looks around the cheap little flat

FRANCIE
Surprise Papa Welcome to your new
home
JOHNNY
Yeah its kind of a surprise all
right
(after a moment
to Katie)
Did you move up here because it was
cheaper -- I mean because --
KATIE

(not looking at him)
We got to save where we can
somebodys got to I dont mind the
extra stairs

JOHNNY
(very quietly)
Yeah

He goes dejectedly to the window accepting the full measure
of his defeat The children lost in this adult mystery only
know that Papa needs cheering

FRANCIE
We can still see the tree

NEELEY
Pop the top floor tenants the
roof is theirs and I aint goin to
let anybody up there except Henny
Gaddis because-- Hey does Pop know

KATIE
Flossie Gaddis died last night

JOHNNY
(instinctively)
Ah the poor baby

FRANCIE
Everybody says its a mercy but I
think it must be awful sad to die

JOHNNY
(touching her hand)
Well I dont know baby Maybe not
if you get to a place where things
are goin to keep gettin worse for
you instead of better Nice her mama
got her all them pretty dresses

KATIE
(impulsively)
Only now itll mean the poor
thingll have to lay in Potters
Field

JOHNNY
(quietly)
Yeah but she had the dresses

Katie doesnt like this kind of talk that makes her kids
brood over things way over their heads

KATIE
(abruptly)
You better show your papa the piano

JOHNNY
Yeah we better look at the piano
Prima Donna

FRANCIE
(going into the parlor)
The lady that was here left it--

Alone Katie picks up the bank and the scene cuts to the
PARLOR Johnny under the fascinated gaze of his children
strikes a chord

JOHNNY
Good tone Its nice
(he sits down his
spirits rising)
Itd be nice if you kids had some
lessons now we got it Maybe--

It isnt any good His fingers move over the piano and
strike a note or two which suggest a song to him He starts
to sing Annie Laurie simply beautifully The children
are spellbound Katie appears in the doorway and listens a
moment She is moved not only by the singing but by an
obscure sense of guilt She speaks softly

KATIE
I never heard you sing that before
Its -- pretty

He doesnt look at her but goes on singing As though it
were a reproof Katie shrugs and leaves the doorway
Johnnys song goes on all his longing and defeat pouring
out Francie watches and listens with all her heart After
a moment a faint sound of hammering comes from the bedroom
and we next see the BEDROOM CLOSET and Katie kneeling
hammering down the bank with an old shoe fastening it to
the floor exactly as it was in their old closet In a dark
corner the little bassinet stands hidden waiting The song
drifts in Katie pauses almost imperceptibly listening Her
eyes rise to the bassinet She goes back determinedly to
nailing down the star bank as the scene fades out

E

FRANCIES CLASSROOM fades in and we first get a close view
of a well-filled Christmas basket on Miss McDonoughs desk
and A Merry Christmas card from the Eighth Grade Then the
camera pulls back to reveal Miss McDonough finishing tying a
bow on the basket and the class in their seats The room
has some decoration for the Christmas season

MISS MCDONOUGH

(brightly)
Well This winds up a very pleasant
term And Im sure well all enjoy
our holidays more knowing weve
helped some unfortunate family whod
have had no Christmas dinner without
this basket

(she turns to the

class to dismiss them)
And so a very Merry-- Oh one last
thing This little pie Miss Shilling
brought up was left over Its a bit
crushed but-- anybody want it

There is no answer from the class They are all anxious to
get going Francie has the impulse to speak but is afraid
to Her mouth waters for the pie

MISS MCDONOUGH
(smiling)
My what well-fed boys and girls
All right class--

FRANCIE
(unable to stand it)
Miss McDonough
MISS MCDONOUGH
Yes Frances

FRANCIE
I -- I just remembered -- I know a
very unfortunate family -- They live
in a -- a hovel and there are two

children little golden-haired twins

and theyre all starving The pie
will -- will probably save their
lives

Miss McDonough knows the story is phony She eyes Francie

with a barely perceptible compassion

MISS MCDONOUGH
Then you shall take the pie by all

means You can come and get it after

class is dismissed--

(smiling)
--which is now Merry Christmas to
you all

CLASS
Merry Christmas Miss McDonough

The class breaks up and stampedes for the door some of the

youngsters coming past Miss McDonoughs desk

wishing her an

added Merry Christmas -- This dissolves to FRANCIE standing

in front of MISS MCDONOUGHS DESK

MISS MCDONOUGH
(very kindly)
That was a very fine Christmas

spirit Frances but -- it seems
such a tiny pie to save so many
lives

FRANCIE

It wont seem small to them Miss
McDonough even a little pie can
look awful big if you havent had
very much to eat for days and days
Ill have to tell them to eat it
slowly because if they eat it too
fast on an empty stomach -- theyll
-- theyll --

Miss McDonough doesnt say a word through this but her

level gaze is too much for Francie

FRANCIE
(miserably)
It isnt true its all a lie I
wanted it for myself
(desperately)
Tll stay after school Ill do
anything but dont send a note
home

Francie is near tears Miss McDonough takes her hand
consolingly

MISS MCDONOUGH

(gently)
Im not going to punish you child
for being hungry -- or for having an
imagination

At these magic words Francie looks at the teacher
incredulously There is a little pause

MISS MCDONOUGH

(with a little twinkle)
You know thats something very few
people have Its very precious

(a trifle more seriously)
But it can also be dangerous unless
we learn how to use it Our everyday
lives are real and true arent they
But all the stories in the world
all the music came out of someones
imagination So if we read the truth
and write the lies then they arent
lies anymore they become stories
Like some of the very nice
compositions youve written
Frances

FRANCIE
(carried away)
Like the one about my father taking
me to see the cotton fields down
South We didnt really go

MISS MCDONOUGH

Well -- I rather guessed you hadnt
But dont you think it would be
still better if youd write about
the things you really know about
and then add to them with your
imagination Even stories shouldnt
be just-- well pipe dreams Pipe
dreamers can be very lovable people
but -- they dont help anybody not
even themselves

(patting the

wondering Francie)
Think about it a little And now
enjoy your pie and have a Merry
Christmas

FRANCIE
(in a daze)
Yes Miss McDonough Thank you Miss
McDonough

She goes so entranced that she is quite unaware of the pie
she is carrying Miss McDonough looks after her
affectionately

The scene dissolves to a STREET with Francie walking home so
beautifully deep in thought that she is still completely
unaware of the pie As she comes to a corner she is met by
an impatient Neeley who has been waiting for her

NEELEY
For gosh sakes where you been You
was supposed to meet me at--
(seeing the pie)
Whered you swipe that

FRANCIE
Neeley Im-Im going to be a writer

NEELEY
All right but lets eat the pie

Francie looks at the pie surprised that she has it Neeley
promptly takes it and breaks it in two -- gives her half and
starts on the other half himself

NEELEY
(his mouth full of pie)
Come on we got to get there about
our Christmas tree

FRANCIE
(coming back to earth)
Oh golly it isnt gone is it

Neeley shakes his head already moving on Francie starts to
eat her part of the pie as she follows and the scene
dissolves to a CHRISTMAS TREE STAND in the afternoon
Theres a rather small selection of Christmas trees near the
sidewalk The Christmas tree vendor a big man is trying to
keep warm by flapping his arms as he waits for customers He
has a head cold A few other kids are hanging around --
Francie and Neeley appear and go straight to the biggest
tree

NEELEY
Yeah its still here He aint got
much time left to sell it

The vendor comes up a woman customer with him
VENDOR

(to all the kids)
Go on beat it you know I aint
goin to throw em till midnight
You tryin to block the sidewalk --
keep customers out

NEELEY AND FRANCIE
Aw you dont own the sidewalk Its
a free country aint it

WOMAN CUSTOMER
(indicating their tree)
No that ones too big I want a
small one

As the woman leaves their tree Francie and Neeley breathe
again

NEELEY
(looking at the tree)
Its awful big to get throwed at
you Why does he have to throw em
at us anyway Why cant he just give
em to us if he dont sell ‘em

FRANCIE
If he just gave them away everybodyd
wait and hed never sell any of ‘em
(she touches the
tree gently)
Gee it smells good

As they settle down to wait the scene dissolves to the
CHRISTMAS TREE STAND at NIGHT A number of excited kids are
standing in two lines forming a sort of lane at one end of
which stands the Christmas tree vendor ready to throw the
trees At the other end of the lane stands a ten-year-old
boy -- The vendor lets go with the tree hits the boy with
it and he goes down There is laughter and jeers -- The kid
gets up scratched and almost crying with disappointment

KID
(almost crying)
I -- I stumbled I couldve--

ANOTHER KID
Gimme a try Im next

The boy who failed is shoved aside the new boy takes his
place The tree is passed back The vendor heaves it and
the boy holds his feet There are cries of triumph

VENDOR
All right take it and get out
(he picks up
the big tree)
Now whos man enough to take a
chance with this here one
Francie pushes forward eagerly but a bigger boy shoves her
out of the way and gets there first

LARGE BOY
I can take anything you got mister
let her fly

FRANCIE
(fiercely)
Im next thats my tree

VENDOR
Aw go on youre too little

FRANCIE
Me and my brother -- were not too
little together

VENDOR
(grinning)
Spunky huh
(he picks up
the tree)
All right but if one of you goes
down you lose the tree

LARGE BOY
That aint fair the two of em

VENDOR
Shut your trap Whos throwin these
trees

Neeley and Francie take their places holding hands to brace
themselves The vendor raises the tree and lets it fly
Neeley would have gone down but Francie catches him
Together they manage to stay on their feet There is an
approving yell from the crowd

VENDOR
(in gruff admiration)
All right take it and get out You
got it comin

The two come to a little dazed Then they grin proudly and
start to drag the tree away

The scene dissolves to the KITCHEN at NIGHT with Katie
Johnny Sissy Steve (her husband to whom she refers as
Bill) and Grandma Rommely in the room They are drinking
coffee waiting for the children to come home There is an
awkwardness and constraint over the whole scene It is
Christmas Eve which should be a very happy time but
conversation has been lagging -- Johnny is playing
solitaire and not looking at anyone Sissy is watching
first one and then the other as she tries to carry the
burden of the conversation
SISSY
Bill thinks the same as me were
goin to keep ours believin in
Santa Claus as long as we can

GRANDMA ROMMELY
(nodding)
Is good yes

Katie has gotten up restlessly and gone to the window to
look out She has scarcely heard what Sissy has been saying
Sissy watches her narrowly

SISSY
Quit worryin about ‘em Katie
theyll be here pretty quick

KATIE
(from the window)
They aint old enough to be out this
late Johnny shouldve made em tell
what they was up to No tellin what
kind of notion Francies likely to
get in her head

SISSY
Theyll be all right

There is no answer from Katie There is silence for a while
Then Steve yawns

SISSY
(a little uncomfortable)
Maybe we better be gettin’ on home
and see em tomorrow

JOHNNY
(quickly)
Dont go

Sissy gives him a quick look There is another little
silence Then it is broken by cries from outside

VOICES OF FRANCIE
AND NEELEY
Pop hey mom Papa

Katie turns back to the window Johnny hurries across to
join her and the others follow They look down and from
their angle we see at the street entrance Francie and
Neeley dragging the Christmas tree They have stopped to
call up to their parents They wave and start on

The scene cuts back to the PARLOR Johnnys spirits lift

JOHNNY
Holy smokes will you look what they
went and done

He dashes out to help them bring the tree up the stairs
Katie is relieved that the youngsters are all right
Johnnys exit gives Sissy a little moment alone with Katie

SISSY
Theyre tryin to make a Christmas
Help ‘em kid

Her eyes meet Katies levelly Katie smiles in answer -- a
reassurance that she will try to make Christmas what it
should be for them in spite of the constraint within their
house

In the NOLAN TENEMENT VESTIBULE Francie and Neeley are now
seen dragging the tree through the door Officer McShane
comes in and starts to help

FRANCIE
(defensively)
Its ours we won it

NEELEY
(proudly)
Looka my face we got it throwed at
us
MCSHANE

I was only wonderin if you couldnt
use a little help

He picks up the other end of the tree and helps them along
with it Francie accepts his geniality with just a trace of
surprise Next we see the HALL as Johnny comes running down
the stairs He opens the door and the children come in All
speak at once

JOHNNY
How in Jerusalem--

FRANCIE
We won We stood up to ‘em

NEELEY
Looka my face Pop looka my face

McShane helping with the tree comes through the door

JOHNNY
Nobody around here ever saw a tree
like that

FRANCIE

We won it fair
NEELEY
Looka my face if you dont believe me

JOHNNY
I see you got the law on your side
too

MCSHANE

Merry Christmas to you Mr Nolan
and it looks like youre going to
have one

JOHNNY
Same to you Mr McShane and
thanks

TYNMORE SISTERS
(having opened their door)
Merry Christmas Mr Nolan Merry
Christmas children

JOHNNY
Merry Christmas Miss Maggie Merry
Christmas Miss Lizzie

FRANCIE
Isnt it a wonderful Christmas
papa

JOHNNY

Well it is now Prima Donna
Imagine us having a tree like that
-- and the nicest kids in the world
I guess

Johnny and the youngsters have started up the stairs
dragging the tree The racket brings the neighbors to their
doors

JOHNNY
(out of pure exuberance
he starts singing)
Silent night holy night--

As they mount the stairs another door or two open Some of
the neighbors have been in bed some are still dressed --
Mrs Gaddis at her door joins in the singing -- A man
starts to sing McShane opens the door from the street and
stands looking up after them listening -- A little girl
claps her hands delightedly -- More singers join in

SISSY
(to Katie)
He aint any older than they are

Katie is at the head of the stairs With her is Sissy
Sissys husband Steve and Grandma Rommely A man from the
fourth floor joins them He sings -- Katie is moved and
starts to sing As she does tears glisten in her eyes --
Sissy is also moved Her tears are more uninhibited than
Katies Grandma Rommely joins in in German -- Johnny and
his children struggle their way up the stairs Several
people are singing now -- Neeleys excitement somehow
subdues He finds himself singing with the others -- But
Francie is too thrilled and awed to sing Her eyes are wide
with the wonder of her father -- of what he has done to
these people

This dissolves to the NOLAN PARLOR somewhat later The tree
braced in Katies scrub bucket stands in the middle of the
room pretty well filling it The family is gathered round
the tree and have been opening various small presents
Grandma Rommely sits in her chair near the window Sissy is
on the floor with the children Neeley has several strips of
court plaster on his face The tree is sparsely decorated
principally with strips of colored paper the children have
torn Uncle Steve is standing on a chair hanging a few
candy canes The usual evidences of coffee and cups are
about

KATIE
Can you put it higher Bill

STEVE
(mildly obeying)
Steves the name

SISSY
Thats better Bill

KATIE
(with a deliberate
effort for Johnny)
It was real nice of your friend --
of Mr McGarrity sendin the kids
them canes

JOHNNY
Yeah

But Neeley opening a package breaks across

NEELEY
Aw -- old itchy underwear

JOHNNY
Think of all the fun you can have
scratchin

FRANCIE
(taking out an
identical pair)
Thank you mama They -- theyre
just fine
KATIE
(smiling)
You know you hate em

FRANCIE
(a little shyly)
I got something for you too

She goes to her couch and starts pulling out the large box
from under it in which she keeps her treasures During this
Steve has dismounted and Grandma now takes out of her bag a
thick home-made candle

GRANDMA ROMMELY
I have made this candle for today
It is time now to light it

Steve and Johnny take and light it Francie has pulled out
two small packages from her box and gives one to Katie

FRANCIE
Merry Christmas mama -- from Neeley
and me

KATIE

(opening it)
Rose water and glycerine Its
pretty -- what is it

FRANCIE
You rub it on your hands

NEELEY
I think its silly But Francie
said papa was always talkin about
what nice hands you got It cost a
dime but we had a seltzer bottle
top in the junk

KATIE
(rubbing some
on awkwardly)
My Ill be quite the thing wont I

FRANCIE
(giving the other
package to Johnny)
This is for you papa from me and
Neeley

Johnny opens it and holds up a rather odd-looking affair --
a watch fob made out of braided shoelaces

FRANCIE
Its a watch fob Its made out of
shoelaces I wove it on a spool with
nails

JOHNNY
(touched)
Well now if that aint about the
nicest thing I ever saw

He takes his union button from his lapel and pins the fob on
his trousers as if he had a watch He makes a little show of
parading up and down with it then tosses a handkerchief
over his arm like a waiters napkin

JOHNNY
(bending over Francie)
Were all out of mushrooms under
glass madam but I can tell you the
time

FRANCIE
Maybe its kind of silly with you
not having a watch

JOHNNY
(holding her to him)
Prima Donna its the nicest present
I ever got And thank you son

NEELEY
Youre welcome I guess the
shoelaces was mine

Everybody laughs

FRANCIE
It was silly

SISSY
(gaily)
Aint nothing silly on Christmas

Steve clears his throat and reaches into his inside pocket
half pulling out a parcel

STEVE
I -- I got a little present here--

He is interrupted by a knock on the door Everyone is a
little startled Francie goes out to the kitchen to open the
door

STEVE
(trying again)
Like I was sayin I got--

But he is interrupted by Francie returning with McShane
who is carrying a bag of candy canes He makes no attempt to
come in but takes in the scene appreciatively
MCSHANE
Merry Christmas folks

CHORUS OF ANSWERS
Merry Christmas

SISSY
Hello handsome

MCSHANE
I was passin and saw your light was
still on and -- I got to thinkin
Id like a hand in fixin that fine
tree -- but I see somebodys already
provided you

KATIE

(charming and shy)
We can always use more of ‘em Mr
McShane and we thank you kindly

She takes the candy canes

JOHNNY
Would you come in and have a cup of
coffee with us

MCSHANE
Thank you but this evenin is for
families I got to be gettin home
myself so Ill be sayin goodnight
and Merry Christmas to all

AD LIB
Merry Christmas Good night

Johnny follows him out to see him to the kitchen door
Everyone is silent for a moment touched by the little visit

JOHNNY
That was mighty nice of him

SISSY
Hes cute

KATIE
Mr McShane is a fine man

GRANDMA ROMMELY
He is I think sometimes a lonely

man
STEVE

Like I was sayin I -- I got

somethin here -- I mean I gotta

present for -- for somebody that
aint exactly here
(he extracts a tiny baby
sweater from his parcel)
Grandma helped me pick it out Its
for -- you know who

SISSY
(deeply touched)
Aw Bill its beautiful Look
everybody look at the size of them
little sleeves Aw gee I aint
never been so happy Bill honey--

Katie turns from the tree and looks at the sweater with a
strange expression

KATIE
Im goin to get some coffee

She turns abruptly and goes into the kitchen closing the
door

SISSY
(on whom the
impression is
not lost)
I better see if I can help

She follows Katie

This cuts to the KITCHEN Katie is not bothering with the
coffee She is staring out the window as Sissy enters When
she hears Sissy she turns quickly to the stove and pretends
to be busy

KATIE
(dissembling)
I just wanted a breath of air for a
minute I--

SISSY
(quietly)
Katie
KATIE
(after a pause)
Yeah

SISSY
(coming closer to help)
Im glad for you

Katie meets her eyes for a moment in acknowledgment of the
truth

KATIE
I dont know I -- Im scared I
guess

SISSY
You got no call to be Look at how
swell them two are

KATIE
Yeah I know

SISSY
Have you told Johnny
(Katie shakes her head)
Youd ought to maybe itd help him

KATIE
Yeah
(she gives Sissy an
affectionate smile)
We better take the coffee in

SISSY
Youre a fine girl Katie I never
said any different

Their eyes hold for a minute with a feeling of understanding
between them Then Sissy picks up some cups and takes them
into the other room Katie prepares to follow

This cuts to the PARLOR as SISSY comes in with the cups
Johnny is picking out a tune on the piano the children are
beside him -- Sissy pauses for a moment and looks at
Johnny with Francie leaning close against him To Sissy it
looks like a portrait of a good enough parent -- She sets
the cups down on the piano Then she bends over suddenly and
kisses Johnny on the top of his head
SISSY
Thats for nothin Johnny -- except

maybe bein a nice guy

Johnny looks up and smiles at her Then Sissy breaks the
little moment of feeling between them

SISSY
Coffee everybody

As she starts to set out the cups and Katie comes in with
the coffee the scene dissolves to the KITCHEN where the
cups are being put into the sink It is late and the family
is alone carrying things into the kitchen straightening up
after the party Katie is getting ready to wash the dishes

JOHNNY
Dont do em tonight its Christmas

Ill give you a hand tomorrow

KATIE
(with a little smile)
You better give me a hand right now
before it slips your mind

JOHNNY
(grinning)
Yeah I guess youre right

KATIE
And you better get to bed son
before you go to sleep standin up

NEELEY
Okay Goodnight

He goes to his bedroom practically asleep They smile
Katie starts to wash the dishes and Johnny and Francie pick
up cloths to wipe them

JOHNNY
Bill was funny wasnt he -- nice I
mean

KATIE

Yeah Sissys awful happy

JOHNNY
Theres somethin good about
Christmas everybody was swell

FRANCIE
Papa why did Grandma say Mr
McShane was lonely

JOHNNY
I dont know maybe he is at that

KATIE
How do you mean Johnny What do you
now about him

JOHNNY

Oh some Hes a fine man Come to
this country with nothin worked
hard studied to get on the force
Some folks was kind to him when he
first come he lived with ‘em and
then their daughter was in trouble
her husband ran off and left her
when she was goin to have a kid So
McShane married her to take care of
ner

KATIE
Have they got -- children

JOHNNY
(shaking his head)
There was a couple but they died
when they was young with lung
trouble they took from their mother
He dont ever talk about it but I
guess he is kind of lonely

KATIE
(abruptly)
It aint right

JOHNNY
(quietly)
No I guess it aint

KATIE
It aint right Why did she have to
put her troubles off on him A fine
man like him steady and all he
ought to have a fine home and
children thats every good mans
right

Katie had no intention of saying this It comes from her a
little too violently born of her feeling of desperation
But once said it hangs between them like a shadow There is
a little pause Johnny grows very quiet and the gaiety of
the Christmas is gone

Francie wide-eyed looks from one to the other She senses
that Johnny has been hurt Instinctively she slips her hand
into his

Johnny suddenly aware of the touch looks down at her and
smiles thinly his hand tightening on hers

JOHNNY
Thats about all the dishes baby
you better get to bed

FRANCIE
Yes papa
KATIE
And go to sleep -- dont just lie

there lookin at the tree all night

FRANCIE
I wont mama Goodnight papa

JOHNNY
Goodnight baby

Francie goes into the parlor and closes the door Left alone
there is an awkward little pause between Johnny and Katie

JOHNNY
Theyre fine kids

KATIE
Yes they are
JOHNNY
(hanging up

the dish cloth)
Thats about all I guess

There is a moments pause but Katie makes no move to go
Johnny stands uncertainly Then abruptly Katie turns to him

KATIE
Johnny I got to tell you somethin
maybe it aint the best time maybe
it is The reason I moved us up here
-- were goin to have a baby
Johnny thats why I been scrimpin
so much and tryin to save

Johnny feels that he ought to take her in his arms -- he
would have if everything were really all right between them
But instead there is a little pause

JOHNNY
(quietly)

Thats-- I mean Im awful glad
Katie if -- if you are

KATIE
Theres a lot we got to think about
Johnny

JOHNNY
I know but -- well manage Maybe
thingsll be -- better havin one to

kind of grow up with again

KATIE
I got things all figured out I
oughta be able to keep on workin
till anyway April Then Franciell
have to leave school and get her
workin papers Shes young but
with what she can make we can make
out and--

JOHNNY
(instinctively)
Aw no Katie we cant--

KATIE
(quickly)
I dont like it any better than you
do but I thought and thought and
there aint any other way And you
got to help with somethin Johnny

She listens to you you got to quit

keepin her all so excited about her
school and--

JOHNNY
But Katie why does it have to be
Francie Neeleys the boy and he
dont care like she does

KATIE
Maybe thats why maybe itll do her
good to get out in the world and
learn how to take care of herself
learn somethin practical while shes
young Shes got to learn some day

JOHNNY
There -- there must be somethin
else Katie -- Dont tell her yet
Katie theres time till April
Maybe I -- Im goin to try to swing
somethin’

KATIE
We cant count on that Johnny
(then defensively)
School aint everything maybe
sometime she can go back
(she cant stand

his look)
Dont look at me like that It aint
my fault

(she manages to get

hold of herself a

little)

It aint yours either I guess I
dont know

(turning away)

Anyway one member of the Nolan
family will get to graduate and she
come close thats somethin

This small effort at optimism gets no response from Johnny
Katie hardens

KATIE
You better put out the light and
lets try and get some rest

She goes into the bedroom without looking at him again
Johnny stands alone -- looks after her a moment brooding
His hand plays with the watch fob and he looks toward
Francies door After a moment he crosses the room and very
gently opens the door to the parlor

Johnny closes the door and moves softly to Francies couch
The light from the window shows her wide awake looking up
at him

JOHNNY
I thought youd be asleep Prima
Donna

Francie is in a new mood a little girl just stepping over
the line into wondering adolescence They both talk softly
secretly alone in the world He sits on the edge of the
bed

FRANCIE
Uh-uh I been -- thinking

JOHNNY
Well now you ought to be careful
about that so many things in this
world to think about you might never
get to sleep

FRANCIE
Papa I might be going to be a
writer I -- Ive just about decided
JOHNNY
(gently)

I knew you when you was goin to be
a lady fireman

FRANCIE
Dont joke papa Im serious

JOHNNY
(gently)
All right baby All I meant maybe
its better sometimes not to get

your heart set on -- on just the one
thing oh in case somethin happens
or--

FRANCIE

(scarcely hearing him)
She said Miss McDonough I mean
she said maybe I could be She says
I have imagination Do you think I
have papa

JOHNNY
Sure I do baby Those compositions
of yours they been fine But--

FRANCIE
She said Id have to work hard she
said imagination wasnt any good if
you were just a pipe-dreamer about
it you didnt help anybody that way
not even yourself

JOHNNY
I see yeah a pipe-dreamer

FRANCIE
Im not putting it good like she did
-- Oh I just understood everything
she said and now I dont but-- I
kind of still do I wish you
couldve heard her she was
wonderful Forever and ever Ill be
glad you helped me go to that school

JOHNNY
(finding it
pretty tough)
You kind of like that school dont
you baby

FRANCIE
Yes oh yes And she said lots more
Ive been trying to remember -- she

said even if you have imagination
its better to write about things
you know about so it will be true
and -- and the way things are Ive
been looking at things all day to
see them that way only--

JOHNNY
Only what baby

FRANCIE
Papa the people in the hall when we
brought up the tree the look on
their faces all friendly and nice
-- why arent people like that all
the time not just Christmas

JOHNNY
Well Id say it was -- I dont
know Maybe its just they take time
at Christmas or -- or maybe you

oughtnt to think like that baby
Maybe Christmas is like people
really are and the other part aint
true and with all that imagination
you got maybe if you just think
about it hard enough that way you
know like it ought to be--

He flounders to a stop
FRANCIE

But when you get to thinking -- papa
the people in Aunt Sissys magazines
they dont just live happily ever
after do they

JOHNNY
No baby

FRANCIE
Well the trouble is -- it doesnt
feel good when you think about
things like that -- I mean the way

they really are

She is really troubled Johnnys smile as he looks down at
her is curious gentle and somehow infinitely sad

JOHNNY
You better stick out your tongue
baby
(as she obeys him)
Just what I was afraid of You got a
bad case a very bad case

FRANCIE
Case of what papa

JOHNNY
You got a very bad case of growing
up Prima Donna

She realizes he is joking and smiles shyly

JOHNNY
(gently)
Thats all it is It aint fun
sometimes but dont you be afraid
I dont want you should ever be
afraid

Francie smiles then settles back relaxed Almost as if in
confirmation of his words she makes a small almost
unconscious movement of pulling the covers up higher -- the
first subconscious awareness of herself as something more
than a child It is not lost on Johnny

FRANCIE

(sighing deeply)
Youre so nice papa I was feeling
kind of funny before you came in
Now I feel good

(she yawns

contentedly)
I guess its better if you dont
just stay young all your life it
will be nicer growing up

Johnny looks at her for a long moment then gets to his feet
He has had about all he can take and there is a weariness
about him His eyes are shadowed by the vision of that not
far distant day when Francie will no longer look at him with
the eyes of a child but will see him as Katie sees him and
as he sees himself

JOHNNY
(very quietly)

Yeah When you begin to see things
like they really are

The bitterness of his meaning is lost on Francie He bends
down and kisses her gently

JOHNNY
Goodnight baby

FRANCIE
(drowsily)
Goodnight papa Im sleepy now

JOHNNY
Thats fine baby thats fine

He goes out and closes the door quietly Francie is
half-asleep

Back in the KITCHEN Johnny stands a moment near the door
Then mechanically he turns off the gas There is a light
from Katies bedroom He crosses to the door and stops at
the bedroom Katie is in bed in the background an arm over
her eyes to shield them from the light A feeling of
revulsion comes over Johnny How can she lie there so
peacefully so soon after making her decision about Francie
At that moment it would be inconceivable for Johnny to go
into that room and lie down beside her He turns abruptly
and starts to go Katie stirs

KATIE
(sleepily)
Aint you comin to bed Johnny

JOHNNY
Im goin out for a little walk

He moves out into the kitchen Katie sits up

KATIE
Dont start drinkin not tonight
Johnny

JOHNNY near the door leading to the hall is taking down
his hat

JOHNNY
(quiet strained)
I wont Katie -- I wont
KATIE
(from the bedroom)

Well --- take your muffler its
cold

JOHNNY
Yeah

He goes out Katie is troubled for a moment then gives it
up and lies down wearily

The HALL is dark and deserted Johnny starts down the stairs
mechanically slowly putting the muffler around his neck His
eyes are desperate as the scene fades out

F

The SIGN of the WAITERS UNION HEADQUARTERS fades in Above
it is a banner with the legend Happy New Year This
dissolves to the UNION HEADQUARTERS in the late afternoon
Katie is at the desk talking to the man in charge

MAN
No maam Mr Nolan hasnt been
around for several days

KATIE
Is he out on a job do you know

MAN
If he is he didnt get it through
us

KATIE
Thank you

As she starts out the scene dissolves to MCGARRITYS
SALOON Katie enters hesitates decides to go on passes
the sign at the side that says family entrance hesitates
again and goes in

This in turn dissolves to MCGARRITYS SALOON disclosing
several customers and quite a bit of noise McGarrity is
behind the bar A boy comes in from the back room speaks to
him but we cannot distinguish what he says McGarrity looks
surprised and starts for the back room

We see the BACK ROOM as McGarrity enters from the saloon
There are a few people in this room Katie is standing just
inside the street door a little uncomfortable McGarrity
goes to her

MCGARRITY
How are you Mrs Nolan and Happy

New Year

KATIE
The same to you Mr McGarrity I

-- I just came to--

(she cant make it --

to ask about Johnny)

I just happened to be passin and I
ought Id run in and thank you for
e candy canes It was nice of you

att

MCGARRITY
Thats all right It wasnt much

KATIE
Well it was nice of you anyway
(then after an
awkward pause
she turns to go)
Well goodnight Mr McGarrity

MCGARRITY
Goodnight Mrs Nolan

She gets the door open and then McGarrity stops her

MCGARRITY
Mrs Nolan
(Katie turns)
Johnny aint here -- he hasnt been
in since before Christmas

Katie stands for a moment caught between gratitude for his
understanding and the stubbornness of her pride The latter
wins She hurries out and the scene dissolves to the NOLAN
TENEMENT at night Most of the lights are out but the light
is still on in the Nolan kitchen This dissolves to the
NOLAN HALL as McShanes feet are seen mounting the stairs
and then to the NOLAN DOOR as McShane comes into view He
stands for a moment before he knocks Almost immediately the
door opens to reveal Katie still dressed and anxious eyed
-- Behind her Francie appears in her nightgown from the
parlor and stands wide-eyed and apprehensive

MCSHANE
Im afraid its bad news Im bringin
you Mrs Nolan Our station got a
report that Mr Nolan was found over
in Manhattan very sick Hes been
taken to the hospital

Francies eyes are tragic but she makes no sound -- Katie
turns without a word and picks up her coat Then she sees
Francie

KATIE
See that Neeley gets to school in
time in the morning Theres an
apple for your lunches
Francie stares at her as Katie struggles into the coat

MCSHANE
The report was that he just
collapsed right in the doorway of an
employment agency He was just goin
out on a job sand hog in a tunnel
they said He hadnt been drinkin
maam hed been waitin there a
long time for the job -- he was just
sick

Katie is going out past him as he finishes McShane follows
and closes the door shutting out the tragic little figure
of Francie

This scene dissolves to a HOSPITAL CORRIDOR as Katie comes
out of a ward accompanied by a nurse The nurse closes the
door

NURSE
We did everything we could

KATIE
Yeah I know

As she starts walking down the hall the scene dissolves to
the HOSPITAL DOCTORS OFFICE where Katie is standing in
front of the doctor at his desk

DOCTOR
Just a few questions Mrs Nolan --
date of birth and so on

KATIE
What are you writin down that he
died from

DOCTOR
Acute alcoholism and pneumonia One
led to the other

KATIE
I dont want you to write down that
he died like that Put just the
pneumonia doctor

DOCTOR
I cant do that Pneumonia was the
direct cause of death but the
alcoholism--

KATIE
(breaking through)
Look hes dead I got two nice kids
Theyre goin to grow up to amount
to something Why do you have to
make it harder sayin their father

died because of the drink when that
-- thats only a little piece of the
truth He wasnt drinkin they said
so he was out looking for work why
dont you put that down

DOCTOR
(after a moment)
Cause of death pneumonia Date of
birth

There are tears in Katies eyes but something fierce too
shines through them as the scene dissolves to the KITCHEN
We get a close view of Francie dry-eyed staring out of the
window She is looking down at the tree hardly aware of the
sordid conference with the undertaker that is going on in
the room Then the camera pulls back over the dialogue to
reveal Katie Sissy Grandma Rommely Neeley and the
undertaker Neeley is crying He stands next to his mothers
chair Her arm is around him and from time to time she
gives him half automatically a comforting pat

UNDERTAKER
Its a first-class funeral with
nickel handles on the coffin and
for two hundred dollars it includes--

SISSY
(bitterly)
Aint it odd that the best you can
do comes to just what his insurance
amounted to

UNDERTAKER
Ill make it one eighty five and I
wont be makin hardly a cent

KATIE
(dully)
All right

UNDERTAKER
(producing pen and
printed form quickly)
Sign here please That gives me the
right to collect the insurance and
Ill give you the fifteen dollars in
cash now

GRANDMA ROMMELY
(as Katie takes the pen)
Read it before you sign

Katie pauses and stares at it for a moment She looks at
Neeley who is sniffing Then she looks around for Francie
and sees her at the window
KATIE
Francie
(Francie turns slowly)
Youre the best reader

Francie comes down slowly not looking at them She takes
the paper and studies it dry-eyed -- Sissy studies this
strange shut-in quality in Francie with compassion

FRANCIE
It says what he says

She hands it back and goes back to the window -- Katie
signs the paper The undertaker takes it from her

UNDERTAKER
And now Mrs Nolan if you have the
deed to the funeral plot

KATIE
Plot We dont own no plot I
thought--

SISSY

You was awful careful not to mention
it till she signed

UNDERTAKER
But Mrs Nolan--

KATIE
Never mind How much is a plot

UNDERTAKER
All prices Twenty thirty -- the
least would be twenty

There is a silence Then Katie gets wearily to her feet
and crosses to the bedroom As she passes Francie Francie
does not turn but continues to stare at nothing out the
window

Once in the BEDROOM Katie picks up a shoe-horn from the
dresser goes to the closet and as she starts to pry up

the star bank the scene dissolves to a CEMETERY where
Johnnys coffin is in place over the grave There are quite
a number of people and quite a number of floral offerings
some large and some very small The priest is reading the
service for the dead as the view moves down the line of the
Nolan family successively disclosing Grandma Rommely eyes
closed lips moving in silent prayer Uncle Steve his
honest face full of emotion Sissy crying openly the tears
welling straight from her warm heart Neeley awed sniffing
a little standing close to his mother and holding on to a
fold of her coat Katie moved feeling strange things at
the sight of all the flowers and all the people who have
turned out to offer their affection to Johnnys memory

We get a view of the people and the flowers as she sees
them -- McGarrity the man from the union headquarters
several recognized neighbors from the tenement and quite a
number of people we have never seen before The feeling of
all of them is so apparently genuine Johnnys coffin is
covered with their flowers

Katie seen close is a little bewildered So many people
loved Johnny he must not have been just a failure to them
She looks down at Neeley and then on the other side at
Francie

Francie stands unlike Neeley quite apart from Katie She
is still dry-eyed lost If Neeley has lost a father and
Katie a husband Francie has lost her whole world And in
her loss she has no inclination as has Neeley to reach
toward Katie

Katies eyes are troubled a little puzzled as she watches
her daughter -- and the scene dissolves to the FUNERAL
CARRIAGE disclosing KATIE FRANCIE SISSY NEELEY The
carriage is coming down the street toward the tenement
Francie sits dry-eyed and aloof Katie still in the
bewildered mood of the funeral is trying to puzzle things
out

KATIE
All them people and the flowers --
some of em from people I never heard
of even Whodve thought that many

folks -- I mean they was carryin
on like -- like they was his family
or -- I dont know

Katie is so intent on her own troubled problem that she is
quite unaware of Francie But Sissy is aware of what both of
them are feeling She sees that Francies eyes hold
something like the beginning of hatred for Katie

SISSY
Yeah he took the time to make a lot
o people love him all right

KATIE
Its hard to figure so many of ‘em
showin up and they was feelin
somethin there wasnt no reason
for em to put on I mean he wasnt
nobody big he was just--

SISSY
(putting her hand
quickly on Katies
arm)
I wouldnt talk about it no more
now kid

She has seen Francie turn bitterly away from her mother
Quite unintentionally Katies words have been a violation of
Francies feeling about her father

This dissolves to the NOLAN TENEMENT the carriage just
stopping Francie still bitterly tense gets out first and
starts swiftly down the street Katie climbing out with
Neeley sees this

KATIE
Francie

SISSY
Best leave her go Katie She maybe
wants to be by herself

KATIE
(watching Francie
go troubled)
Shes takin on kind of funny She
aint even cried

SISSY
Best leave her come out of it her
own way

KATIE

(not even hearing)
They was always funny together --
nice I mean They was like kids
they never ran out of talk

(after a little pause)
Well one thing -- he never lived to
see that change he beat that one

SISSY
You want for me to come up with you

KATIE
(as Sissy watches her
trying to puzzle it out)
And theres somethin else maybe

that was it -- he wasnt drinkin
they told me there was somethin
drivin him -- maybe that was it
maybe he was tryin to be different
like -- like --

(she turns this over for
a moment then gives up)
I dont know

She turns abruptly without even saying goodbye and starts
into the house Neeley follows Sissy watches after her with
deep compassion as the scene dissolves to a STREET and we
see Francie all alone coming down the street She pauses
in front of a little barber shop and then goes in

In the BARBER SHOP The head barber a little Italian is
half-asleep in the first barber chair The other barber is
working on a customer Francie enters and goes to the head
barber

FRANCIE
(hesitantly)
Id like my fathers shaving cup
please
(pointing to it)
Its that one

BARBER

(looking up)
Oh

(he takes down the

cup with Johnnys name)
Youre the little girl Yes Ill
clean it up for you

(he starts to clean it)
He was a fine man Tell the mama
that I his barber said this

Francie watches as he finishes cleaning the cup and hands it
to her She starts to turn away and then asks--

FRANCIE
Is -- there isnt anything else of
my fathers here is there

BARBER
No thats all he had

As Francie turns and goes the scene dissolves to the NOLAN
KITCHEN Katie is alone in the kitchen The door opens and
Francie comes in carrying the mug Without looking at her
mother she goes straight into the parlor Katie looks after
her forcing herself not to stop her

In the PARLOR Francie pulls out her box from under the
couch adds the shaving mug to a carefully put away
collection of memories of Johnny his tuxedo shirt his
waiters apron his union button the whisk broom with which
he always brushed himself before going out Her face never
changes as she slides the box back under the couch rises
and goes into the kitchen

The KITCHEN Again not meeting Katies anxious eyes she
crosses the kitchen toward the door into the hall Katie can

contain herself no longer

KATIE
Francie

FRANCIE
(stopping but
without turning)

What
KATIE

Francie dear Where you going
FRANCIE

No place

She gets as far as the door

KATIE
Francie

FRANCIE
(still not turning)
Yes mama

KATIE
The neighbors were awful nice
leavin all this food Dont you
want a little somethin

FRANCIE
No mama
KATIE
Well I -- I wanted to talk to you

I want things to go on the reading

and all just like-- I want to do--
(desperately)

I got to be mama and papa both to

you now-—-

She has said the impossible Almost imperceptibly Francie
stiffens

FRANCIE
Yes mama Is that all mama

KATIE
(sheepishly)
Well--
(Francie starts
to go out)
You got to go right now Francie
--

FRANCIE
(desperately)
Ill be back honest I will

She goes out Katie sighs defeated and sinks into a chair
by the table After a moment Neeleys door opens He wants
to comfort her and boyishly says the only thing he can
think of
NEELEY
Mom I -- I guess Im a little
hungry

Katie manages a smile and reaches out a hand to pull him to
her -- Next the ROOF of the NOLAN TENEMENT comes into view
At the edge of the parapet overlooking the city and the
harbor Francie stands living out her own private ceremony
for her father She is unaware of the street noises which
float up unaware even of a woman hanging out wash to dry on
the roof behind her She doesnt even know that tears are in
her eyes because they are not the burning tears that give
relief She might be a very young and bitterly passionate
priestess dedicating herself After a long moment of
silence she lifts her head and looks up

FRANCIE

(very low half

in a whisper)
Look -- he cant be gone he cant
They dont understand Maybe --
maybe you could let me have a baby
some day and it could be a boy so
-- so it could be just like him It
would have to be me nobody else
loved him like -- like I do Maybe
you could do that for me and if
you could -- he wouldnt even --
die

She cant go on as the scene fades out

G

The KITCHEN fades in Francie is ironing her school dress
Katie is just admitting McGarrity He is constrained has
something to say and doesnt know quite how to go about it
He is in his best suit

KATIE
(as he enters)
I hope you dont think Im forward
just comin in like this Oh how
are you Francie

FRANCIE
Im well thank you

KATIE
Have a chair Francie see if Mr

McGarrity wont have some coffee

MCGARRITY
Not for me thank you

He does not sit down but stands turning his hat There is
an awkward little silence Francie keeps on with her
ironing

MCGARRITY
(ill at ease)
I -- I figgered Id ought to come
You might say I knowed Johnny pretty
well in a manner of speakin

KATIE
(with a flicker of humor)
Yes I guess thats right

MCGARRITY
Well the first thing is I guess
you know how Johnny and I done
business He used to give me money
sometimes to keep and then draw
against it and when he -- I mean
I got to lookin around and what do
you think I had pretty near five
bucks in his box I -- I figgered it
belongs to you

He ends very lamely McGarrity is not a facile liar It
doesnt fool Katie but she is touched by his intent --
Francie unnoticed stops ironing at the mention of her
fathers name

KATIE
(with little smile)
If you told the truth itd more
likely be that he owed you But I
thank you very much

McGarrity shifts uneasily He does not like being caught at
being a good man

MCGARRITY
Well I -- I just thought--

KATIE
(quietly)
Well make out

McGarrity uncomfortably returns the bill to his pocket

MCGARRITY

(examining his

hat intently)
Well there was somethin else I
was thinkin -- you know I try to
run a nice place clean so nice
folks can-- Well who I hire is
important they got to be nice too
and I was thinkin that -- that
maybe you wouldnt mind if the kids
come to work for me afternoons
like I mean after school and
Saturdays Maybe it aint just the
kind of place youd favor ‘em
workin but Id keep an eye on ‘em
I could pay em two dollars a week a
piece and-- Id take it as a real
favor maam

McGarrity runs down lamely Katie is really touched

KATIE
(after a moment)
Youre an awful bad liar Mr
McGarrity But youre a very good
man Im ashamed I didnt know it
before

MCGARRITY

(uncomfortably)
No maam it aint that Johnny
was-- I dont know Johnny was
always talkin about his family
like -- like folks ought to only
they dont funny the things he
talked about pretty near always
made you feel better or laugh
like a sea shell I had down there he
was always listenin to and tellin
you what it was singin He was
always givin things like that to
people He -- he was a fine man
Mrs Nolan

McGarritys tribute to Johnny is somewhat confused but the
feeling behind it is so earnest that it cannot be mistaken
-- Francie listens intently McGarritys whole wish to do
something for them is because of his feeling for her father
-- Katie too is moved Enough that she forgets momentarily
that Francie is in the room

KATIE
Id be glad for the children to work
for you Mr McGarrity Four dollars
a week will keep us until the baby
comes and Francie wont have to
quit school she can keep on and
they can both--

She stops She had not intended to say this She looks
quickly at Francie Francies eyes refuse to meet her
mothers She turns back and starts ironing again

MCGARRITY
(sensing tension he
does not understand)
Its a deal Tell em to come to the
family entrance tomorrow right after
school Is that all right with you
Francie

FRANCIE
(not looking up)
Yes

MCGARRITY
Its all settled then Well --
goodbye Mrs Nolan

KATIE
(gratefully)
And thank you again Mr McGarrity

McGarrity goes a little awkwardly Francie and Katie are
left alone and there is a sharp constraint between them
Francie does not look at her mother Katie studies her
troubled

KATIE
Francie

FRANCIE
(ironing)
Yes mama

KATIE
I -- Im glad you can keep on with
your school I didnt tell you
because I was hopin somethin would
happen I didnt want to say
anything until the time came But
there were reasons your papa and I
talked it over there wasnt any
other way--

Francie still avoids looking at Katie

FRANCIE
(quietly)
It doesnt matter Papa saved me

from it

She turns and goes into the parlor closing the door on
Katie as the scene dissolves to MCGARRITYS SALOON Sissy
enters down the street She doesnt bother going around to
the family entrance but barges nonchalantly through the
swinging doors

Two or three customers are visible McGarrity is behind the
bar Neeley is putting a ham and some other things from a
tray onto the free lunch end of the bar The men look up
surprised at seeing a woman enter the bar

SISSY
(to Neeley)
Hi kid Theyre takin chances I
wouldnt leavin you handle the
eats Wheres Francie

NEELEY
(with a full mouth)
Kitchen

SISSY
Thanks Hi Mac

She waves nonchalantly to McGarrity and disappears through
the family entrance toward the kitchen The men look after
her approvingly

In the KITCHEN Francie is dispiritedly cutting some dill
pickles into long lengths as Sissy enters

SISSY
Hello lamb

Francie looks around but does not light up as she generally
does when she sees Sissy

FRANCIE
Hello Aunt Sissy

SISSY

(taking a paper

from the top of

her stocking)
How are you kid Look you got to
help me with somethin This was in
the paper and I cut it out You got
to read it to me and--

(she is suddenly aware

of Francies mood)
Whats the matter hon

FRANCIE
Nothing Im all right Aunt Sissy

SISSY
No you aint kid you aint been
since -- look hadnt you better

spill it to your Aunt Sissy

FRANCIE
(on the defensive)
What is it you want me to read to
you Let me read that Aunt Sissy

SISSY
Well well get that out of the way
first Look here it is likely you
dont remember him but its my last
husband Bill -- the one I thought
was dead But he aint hes got his
picture in here and I got to know
what it says

(Francie takes the

clipping and studies it)
Maybe itll tell where he is so I
can write to him about gettin a
divorce or -- or somethin I dont
want this here one bobbin up and
makin no trouble Hes a fireman
somewhere I can tell that by the
clothes He was just startin out in
the fireman business when--

FRANCIE
It says here hes a hero Aunt Sissy
He saved some people in a fire

SISSY
Does it say where

FRANCIE
The Ninth Precinct Manhattan

SISSY
Manhattan huh -- couldnt make the
grade in Brooklyn I guess Now
listen Francie I want you to write
him for me Write this Dear Bill--

FRANCIE
This says his name is Roland Pulaski

SISSY
Thats right I remember Make it
Dear Mr Pulaski Being Im now
married to somebody else I want you
to see about gettin a real legal
divorce because I thought you was
dead and because you got the money
now on account of the reward Yours
very truly Sissy Something like
that

FRANCIE
But Aunt Sissy he must have already
done that because it says here hes
married again

SISSY
It does

FRANCIE
(reading)
On the human interest side of the
story Mrs Pulaski had returned
home only the day before from the
hospital after presenting Mr
Pulaski with a brand-new son the
fourth child of the marriage
Perhaps it was his pride that--
(looking up)
So if he got a divorce that long
ago you dont have to

SISSY
Then my bein married to Bill --
this one I mean -- is all legal

Francie nods and turns back to slicing the pickles

SISSY
Well now if that aint a load off
my mind You know I think Ill send
Bill Pulaski a weddin present

FRANCIE
But you cant Aunt Sissy hes been
married for years

SISSY

(this news bothers her)
Four kids huh

(then trying to

comfort herself)
Must be a pretty sickly woman this
Mrs Pulaski goin to a hospital
just to have a baby

FRANCIE
(dully)
No Lots of people go there now to
have babies Its better

SISSY

Sure enough

(Francie nods)
You know somethin Im going to
cash in my funeral policy and have
my baby in the hospital And when my
baby is born and lives I want you
to write to that R Pulaski and --
and announce it

(she takes a deep breath)
Hey do I feel better

Francie turns back to her work Sissy has been so concerned
with her own problem that she has hardly been aware of the
apathy with which Francie has shared it But now her own
problem settled she looks down at Francies miserable
little figure her back turned as she works away at the
pickles Sissy suddenly pulls up a chair beside Francie and
sits where she can see Francies face
SISSY

And now chickabiddy were goin to
talk about you Cant your Aunt Sissy

help any

Francie shakes her head miserably

FRANCIE
Im all right

SISSY

But you aint honey not all shut

up like that

(Francie doesnt answer)
I know how you feel but you cant
just keep hangin on to it

FRANCIE

Im all right I dont want to talk

about it

SISSY

All right baby sure But I tell
you what you can do somethin for
me Look -- your mama feels awful

bad too She needs you

Why dont

you talk to her about it--

FRANCIE

(with sudden bitterness)

She doesnt need me

SISSY
Why yes she does hon

FRANCIE

she--

No she doesnt Shes got Neeley
Why wasnt it Neeley she was goin
to make quit school he never cared
about it She doesnt love me like
papa did And she didnt love him
either not really She hurt him

I saw her And he never hurt anybody
Im going to finish this grade
because he gave it to me and then
Ill work for her but she cant be
papa to me she cant ever

This pent-up feeling blazes out

passion that it frightens Sissy

turns blindly back to her work
Moved Sissy puts an arm around
Francie to her

SISSY

of Francie with so much
When it is over Francie
shutting out even Sissy
her and tries to draw

Aw baby dont feel like that
dont--

FRANCIE
(twisting away
from her)
Leave me alone Im all right
Please go away and leave me alone

Rebuffed Sissy is at a loss as to what she can do The
feeling is so fierce that it frightens Sissy Francie is
crying but it is hard and dry not like a child ought to
cry She is fighting it terribly instead of giving way to
it

SISSY
(helplessly)
All right chickabiddy all right

Sissy turns helplessly and goes out Shaken with her
feeling Francie tries to go on with her work as the scene
dissolves to a SCHOOL ROOM where Francie standing by her
desk is reading a composition in the English class

FRANCIE

(reading)
But when he died although many of
the older people said he drank too
much and was a failure the little
children took their pennies and
built this monument to him because
he was so good in his heart and they
loved him best of all And after a
time--

Francie is very earnest as she reads this carried away with
this attempt at justification of Johnny To the children it
is pretty dull But Miss McDonough watches her curiously
unable to understand quite what this is all about as the
scene dissolves and the CLASSROOM is seen after the others
have gone and Francie is standing again in front of Miss
McDonoughs desk She is troubled Miss McDonough holds the
composition

MISS MCDONOUGH
--And the sentence structure is
excellent Francie but theres
something else that worries me If
we are going to write the choice of
subject -- what we write about is
just as important as the writing
itself We ought to write about the
best of things we shouldnt choose
a subject that is ugly and sordid
like--

Francie has been listening miserably and not looking at
Miss McDonough But with this her head comes up
FRANCIE
It isnt sordid it isnt

MISS MCDONOUGH
(surprised)
But Francie I only meant--

FRANCIE
(interrupting)
Maybe I didnt say it right but it
isnt sordid I wont write about it
any more if you dont want me to I
dont care if I dont write anything
any more

She turns quickly to go Miss McDonough is bewildered by
this outburst and would like to get to the bottom of it

MISS MCDONOUGH
Francie--

But Francie hurries on out and Miss McDonough knows there
is no use in trying to stop her

The scene dissolves to the PARLOR Francie has the box of
her treasures pulled out from under the couch She puts
alongside the apron and the shaving mug and the other
treasures the composition about Johnny Her face is hard
and set She shoves the box back under the couch Then she
pulls out another smaller box which she has kept here for
English compositions She picks this up and marches toward
the kitchen

Francie enters from the parlor and carries the box of papers
to the garbage can in the KITCHEN Fiercely she starts to

tear them up and stuff them into the garbage can She is
never going to write anything again -- The scene fades out
H

A HOSPITAL room fades in and we get a close view of a
white-robed doctor bending over a table out of scene The
sound of his slapping a baby to try to start it breathing
can be heard We get a closeup of SISSY in bed
half-conscious as she turns her head to look in the
direction of the sound A nurse comes into the scene and
stands near the doctor

DOCTOR
(quickly)
Oxygen

The nurse goes out quickly

We again get a closeup of SISSY and over it the baby
beginning to cry as the scene dissolves to a HOSPITAL
WAITING ROOM where Steve Katie Neeley Francie and Grandma
Rommely are waiting ill at ease There are a couple of
other expectant fathers in the room Steve gets up and paces
a little and then sits down again but nobody pays any
attention to him -- Neeley is sitting next to Katie and
Katie is watching Francie who is quite apart from the rest
of them staring at nothing out of the window The hospital
and the coming of Sissys baby have made Katie very much
aware of the imminence of her own motherhood -- In a moment
Katie gets up and moves over near Francie

KATIE
(hesitantly)

Francie

FRANCIE
Yes mama

KATIE
I -- I wanted to talk to you
Francie

FRANCIE
Yes mama

KATIE
It isnt going to be long now -- for
me I mean my baby We cant come
to the hospital -- there isnt goin

to be money enough even for the
woman to help

For the first time Francie looks at her

KATIE
Im goin to need you Francie dont
ever be far away Neeley hes -- a
boy aint no good at a time like
this Im countin on you You -- you

wont forget that will you Francie

It is hard going for Katie to put this much into words For
this very reason it is so real that for the first time
Katies need of her stirs something in Francie She looks at
Katie a little wonderingly In the background Grandma Rommely
watches missing nothing

FRANCIE
All right mama I -- Ill remember

In that moment they are closer than they have been in a long
time But the mood of it is broken by the entrance of the
doctor Through the open door a babys crying can be heard

DOCTOR
Which one of you is Mr Stephen
Edwards
STEVE
(rising weakly)
Thats -- thats me

DOCTOR
(to Sissys husband)
Well there are three in your family
now Youre the father of a pretty
fine boy

GRANDMA ROMMELY
(quickly)
Alive

DOCTOR
Very much so He was a little
reluctant about it at first so I
had to rouse him with a little
oxygen Now hes mad at me -- hear
him

STEVE
(hardly able to talk)
I got to see him

DOCTOR
Well neither of them are quite up
to a visit just now In a little
while

He goes out

GRANDMA ROMMELY
(quietly)
The learning It is the learning
that has saved this baby

KATIE
Thats fine Bill

Steve is so excited that he doesnt know what to do
Suddenly he grabs up his hat and starts out

NEELEY
Where you goin Uncle Bill

STEVE
(stopping)
Im goin out and get some strawberry
ice-cream and a rattle for my son
And whats more my name aint Bill

its Steve Do you hear that -- Ima
papa and my name is Steve And its
Uncle Steve too -- Steve Steve

He goes out and slams the door The little family look at
him in surprise

GRANDMA ROMMELY
So We have a man in the family

She nods well content as the scene fades out

I

The NOLAN TENEMENT fades in in the afternoon as Francie
and Neeley with their school books come down the street
Francie stops on the steps of the tenement She takes
Neeleys books

FRANCIE
As quick as we see if shes all
right you go on down to McGarritys
and see if you can do my work too
Im going to stay here

NEELEY
Youre just gettin out of work
thats what youre doin

FRANCIE
No Im going to finish the
scrubbing for her She oughtnt do
anymore she wasnt feeling good
this morning

There is a new little note of authority in Francies manner
She leads the way into the tenement and Neeley follows as
the scene dissolves to the UPPER HALL and we see Francie and
Neeley come up the stairs

FRANCIE
(calling)
Mama

We get a view of the KITCHEN as Francie and Neeley come in
Katie is nowhere in sight

FRANCIE
(apprehensively)
Mama

KATIE
(from the bedroom)
In here Francie

FRANCIE
(quickly to Neeley)
You wait

She goes into the bedroom -- In the BEDROOM Katie is lying
down on the bed She is ill and knows that the time for the
coming of the child is near Francie enters and stops
worried as she sees her mother

FRANCIE
You -- you all right mama
KATIE

Give Neeley a nickel to go after
Grandma and Sissy He can walk home
after Tell him to stop at
McGarritys on the way back and
explain

FRANCIE
(gravely)
Yes mama

She starts out but Katie stops her

KATIE
Get me a nightgown -- the bottom
drawer

Francie obeys and puts it on the bed Katie gets up
Francie stands staring at her worried

KATIE
Hurry dont stand there staring

Francie turns quickly and goes out -- Katie laboriously
starts to stir herself to get into the nightgown

Francie enters the KITCHEN Neeley is very frightened by
what he has heard

NEELEY
Is she goin to die

FRANCIE

(in a tone of assurance

she does not feel)
Of course not Its the baby

(she gets the nickel)
You heard what mama said And hurry
And dont forget stopping at
McGarritys on the way back We
cant lose the work

(with a strange

little pride)
She -- she just wants me now

Awed Neeley starts out When he is gone Francie is lost

She doesnt quite know what to do next She starts to light
the fire under the coffee then listens for any sound from

the other room There is none

FRANCIE
Mama
KATIE
(from the bedroom)
What is it

FRANCIE
(relieved)
Oh Ill be there in -- in a minute

She gets the coffee started and then goes into the bedroom
-- The BEDROOM Katie is in bed as Francie comes in Francie
is helpless now doesnt know what to do next

KATIE
Francie

FRANCIE
Yes mama

KATIE

Dont go away stay close by me

FRANCIE
Yes mama
KATIE
I dont want to be alone What time
is it
FRANCIE
Five to four Im -- Im fixing you

some coffee mama

KATIE
Thats nice

Francie stands helplessly for a moment then
the kitchen -- Francie feels the coffee pot

goes again to
to see if its

hot enough then gets a can of milk and a cup She picks up
the coffee pot and starts in with it then decides to put it
on a kitchen chair for a tray and starts with the whole

thing into the bedroom -- Back in the BEDROOM Francie puts

the improvised tray beside the bed and then

KATIE
You pour it
(Francie obeys)
Is it dark out

FRANCIE
No mama

KATIE
Its dark in here

FRANCIE
Ill light the gas

waits
KATIE
No itll hurt my eyes

Francie puts the cup of coffee on the side of Katies bed
and puts milk in it Then she goes to Katies dresser and
gets what is left of the Christmas candle and starts to
light that -- Katie takes a deep sip of the coffee

KATIE
Tastes good
(she sees what
Francie is doing)
Youre takin real good care of me

FRANCIE
Am I mama

She puts the candle near the bed She wants so desperately
to do something more but doesnt know what

FRANCIE
Can I -- can I get you a glass of
water mama

KATIE

(with sudden irritation)
When I want something Ill ask for it

FRANCIE
Yes mama

KATIE
Dont just throw questions at me
Im too tired You better have some
coffee too

Francie obeys mechanically She is hurt

FRANCIE
(after a moment)
Mama -- even if Neeley is a boy

wouldnt you rather have him here
hes always such a comfort to you

KATIE
No its you thats the comfort now
What time is it

FRANCIE
I dont know mama

KATIE
Get the clock

Francie obeys and goes to the kitchen -- Katie turns
restlessly as there is a spasm of pain -- In a moment
Francie returns with the clock and puts it down beside the
bed

FRANCIE
One minute to four mama

KATIE
Are you sure it isnt slow

FRANCIE
No mama

KATIE
Maybe its fast then

FRANCIE
Ill look at the jewelers clock out
the parlor window

She starts to go but Katie hasnt even heard her

KATIE
The candle is pretty Like Christmas
That was the night I told him
(after a little pause)
Its -- nice havin a visit with my
daughter Hey thats funny youre
drinking your coffee

FRANCIE
(who hadnt
known she was)
Yes mama

KATIE
I didnt want for you to have to
grow up so soon I didnt want for
you to quit school I tried to tell
him that He didnt mind about the
baby but he never forgive me for
wantin you to quit school I told
him and he just went out You never
forgive me either

FRANCIE
Please dont mama

KATIE
He woulda bought you dolls insteada
milk and I dont know maybe you
woulda been happier I dont know I
never woulda thought of givin you
that school like he did And all
them fine compositions of yours I
never read any of em I shouldve
had time Johnny did

(she stirs restlessly)
But I couldnt do any different I
dont know how I could do any
different What time is it

FRANCIE
Five after four

KATIE
Wring a cloth out of cold water and
wipe my face

She turns restlessly Francie awed and frightened gets up
and goes to the kitchen again -- She gets a cloth and
starts to wet it and wring it out in the sink She is
frightened and terribly moved

FRANCIE
(half under her breath)
Dont let her die please dont let
her die Ill give you anything
Ill - Ill give you my writing
Ill never write anything again if
you just let her live

This is only half-articulate She hurries back to the bedroom

In the BEDROOM Katie is quieter again Francie wipes her
face with the cloth and it soothes Katie so that she smiles
a little

FRANCIE
Mama suppose the baby comes before
Grandma and Aunt Sissy get here--
What -- What --

KATIE
(dryly)
I wouldnt be that lucky

Her eyes close for a minute Francie watches her helplessly
In a moment Katies eyes open again and she looks at Francie

KATIE
You can see I couldnt do any
different Neeley -- he doesnt like
school if he stopped hed never go
back again But you-- No matter how
hard it was youd find a way to go
back youd fight to go back You
can see that cant you

FRANCIE
I -- Yes mama

KATIE
Read me something Francie
FRANCIE
Yes mama

KATIE
Read me one of your compositions I
never read any of your compositions
its on my conscience

FRANCIE
I tore all those up

KATIE
No you didnt not all of ‘em

FRANCIE
Cant I read you the Shakespeare it
-- its better

KATIE
Read about Twas on a night like
this Id like to have something
pretty on my mind
(Francie gets the book
from the dresser and
opens it)
Sit by the candle

FRANCIE
The moon shines bright--
In such a night as this
When the sweet wind did gently kiss
the trees--

KATIE
Did you ever find out who Troilus
was and Cressida

FRANCIE
Yes mama Troilus was--

KATIE
Some other day when I got time
Read me one of your compositions now

FRANCIE
You wont like them mama

KATIE
You thought about them and wrote
them and got good marks on them
and I never read one of them
(a little petulantly)
Get them I said

Reluctantly Francie goes to get them Katie stirs restlessly
The pain is getting worse
We see the PARLOR as Francie comes in pulls out the box
from under the couch and reluctantly takes out one of the
compositions She starts back to the bedroom with it

In the BEDROOM Katies eyes are closed as Francie comes in
Seeing this Francie moves very quietly a little relieved
that she may not have to read the composition But Katies
eyes open

KATIE
Sit here
(Francie obeys but does
not start immediately)
Go on

FRANCIE
(not looking at her)
Its called The Man People Loved
(breaking off)
Please dont make me read it mama

KATIE
Read it

FRANCIE

(reading)
Perhaps many people might have said
of him that he was a failure It is
true that he had no gift for making
money but he had a gift for laughter
and for making people love him He
had the gift of making you feel proud
to walk down the street with him He
had nothing to give but himself but
of this he gave generously like a
king And--

KATIE
Like a king thats right walkin
down the street with him you always
felt like that

FRANCIE
Did you mama

KATIE
You were real smart to write it down
like that thats like it was Oh
Francie I miss him so much

There is a new light in Francies eyes as she looks at her
mother Katie stirs restlessly Hardly knowing she is doing
it she reaches out a hand to Francie and hangs on to her
hard She is more than half delirious now so that her
speech is disjointed But at last Johnny and their feeling
for him is in the open between these two
KATIE
If the babys a boy well call him

Johnny Wheres Sissy -- Neeleys
been gone a long time Wipe my face
Francie -- No dont let go my hand

Everybody loved him you could tell
that at the funeral Maybe if its a
girl well call her Annie Laurie --
remember that tune he played You
oughta have music lessons maybe we
can manage it You wont forget to
dust the piano will you Francie
Whod cry about me like that if I
died I never done a wrong thing in
my life but that aint enough I
didnt mean to be hard Sissy like
you said If Johnny was here he
could go to your graduation and Id
go to Neeleys I cant tear myself
into two pieces how am I goin to
go to both Where are you Francie

FRANCIE
(frightened)
Im here mama

KATIE
Youre such a comfort Im so tired
leave me sleep now

Her eyes are closed in half-sleep half-unconsciousness
Francie awed sits holding on to her hand and staring her
as the scene dissolves to the KITCHEN which Aunt Sissy and
Grandma Rommely have just entered from the hall They cross
immediately to the bedroom -- Here Francie is still
holding on to the restless fretful hand She stands up as
Sissy and Grandma come in She is frightened Sissy and
Grandma take off their coats and get ready to go to work
immediately

SISSY
(noticing Francies fear)
You better go out and start some
water boilin chickabiddy Well
call you if there is anything we
need

KATIE
(eyes opening)
I thought you was never comin

SISSY
You quit worryin now

She motions to Francie with her head to go on into the
kitchen and the bewildered Francie obeys Sissy starts
looking in the dresser drawers for cloths and the babys
clothes

The scene dissolves to the KITCHEN where Francie is
mechanically tending the water on the stove The door from
the bedroom opens and Sissy hurries out She tests the water
with her hand

FRANCIE
It isnt boiling yet

SISSY
You let me know when it is Ill
take it in Youre to stay out here

FRANCIE
(wanting to help)
She -- She doesnt want any light
just the candle

SISSY
Shes goin to be all right baby

Sissy starts back to the bedroom

FRANCIE
(troubled)
Aunt Sissy
(Sissy stops)
I just wanted to know -- Did she
want me to stay out -- or --

The question means so much to her in her uncertainty that
she cant go on Sissy understands and comes back to her

SISSY
(gently)
She said you was to stay out kid
People always want to spare the ones
they love

She looks at Francie for a long moment and then turns and
goes on into the bedroom closing the door behind her
Francie stares at it then turns to the window and stares
out Next from Francies point of view we get a view of the
tree struggling into life again -- As Francie stands
looking out at it the scene dissolves to the KITCHEN and we
get a close view of the bedroom door as it opens and Grandma
appears Francie turns quickly

GRANDMA
(smiling)
The baby is here And the mama does
good she sleeps A very small baby
sister it is

Francie is infinitely relieved
FRANCIE
(tremulously)
Annie Laurie Papa would have liked
that

As Grandma smiles at her gently the scene fades out

J

The exterior of FRANCIES SCHOOL fades in as children
dressed for their graduation are going inside with their
parents and this scene dissolves into the SCHOOL CORRIDOR
where Sissy is waiting for Francie who comes out of the
girls washroom and joins her Francie has on a very simple
white graduation dress Excited girls are milling back and
forth in the corridor

FRANCIE
Wheres Grandma

SISSY
(chuckling)
I got her into a front seat so she
wont miss a thing

As they talk they go on into the classroom The exercises
have not yet begun There are flowers on a number of the
girls desks As Sissy and Francie enter one girl calls to
Francie

BERNICE
Hey Francie you better come get
your flowers

She indicates some roses on Francies desk Francie knows
they cant be for her

FRANCIE
(calling back)
They arent mine Im not wearing
flowers tonight
(then to Sissy)
Some of the girls their families
send them flowers

SISSY
(with a little smile)
Theyre on your desk lamb Id go
see

Francie hesitates She would rather not
FRANCIE
Well Ive got to get my things

anyway

She goes toward her desk Sissy watches her Francie comes
up to her desk She makes a show of starting to get her
things together from the desk As she does this she looks
down at the flowers -- We then see a card on the flowers
It reads Miss FRANCES NOLAN -- Francie cant believe it
Then she opens the little envelope and we see that the card
which is in it reads To Francie on graduation day Love
from Papa -- Francie stares awed and frightened She does
not know what to believe and a wave of emotion catches her
Anticipating this Sissy steps in beside her quickly

SISSY
He gave me the money to buy ‘em way
before Christmas To make sure of
havin it he said And he wrote out
the card

Francie stands unbelievingly for a moment Then it is too
much for her A wave of feeling catches her and her face
goes down into the flowers Sissy knows that in a moment
there will be a flood of tears

SISSY
(quickly)
Come on kid

An arm around Francies shoulders she hurries her up the
aisle as the scene dissolves to the GIRLS WASHROOM A girl
is just leaving as Sissy leads Francie in Sissy closes the
door and they are alone

SISSY
Now let it go baby

Francie looks at her and the emotion is too much A sob
catches in Francies throat

SISSY
There nobody wont hear you and I
wont let nobody in You just have
it out

Francie stands clutching the flowers to her and then the
flood of tears breaks

FRANCIE
Papa oh papa--

She starts to cry as she should have long ago and as Sissy
comforts her the scene dissolves to the SCHOOL AUDITORIUM
where we see a line of children filing by to get the
diplomas which are being given out by the principal There
is applause at each name

PRINCIPAL
Eugene Bricker
(holding out the
next diploma)
Frances Nolan

Francie eyes shining receives her diploma -- Sissy
applauds vociferously -- Miss McDonough applauds too and
her eyes are a little misty -- Grandma Rommely is too moved

to applaud She has lived for this moment This is
fulfillment

This dissolves to an ICE CREAM PARLOR with several marble-
topped tables The Nolans are occupying one -- Francie
Neeley Katie and Sissy They are having ice cream Francie
still has her flowers Sissy is talking but Katie is
watching Francie and the flowers

SISSY

Well sir I dont think Grandma spoke
one word the whole time and from the
looks of her when I put her on the
streetcar shell probably ride clear
out to Coney Island and never know
the difference Heaven only knows
what shed have been like if she
couldve got to both graduations

KATIE
(looking at Francie)
Looks to me like it was a pretty
good day Your soda all right
Francie

FRANCIE
(looking at her shyly)
Pineapples not as good as chocolate

NEELEY
Then what did you order it for

FRANCIE
Because Im up to the Ps Ill try
raspberry next

SISSY
(laughing)
Theres somethin to that idea --
Try everything once

At this Katie giver her a significant look
At the table behind them a man pays his check and gets up
MAN
(to the waiter)
And a dime for you my boy This is

a special night

His party goes out Their boy too has a diploma
KATIE

(smiling)
He dont know how special -- Two
diplomas in the Nolan family all in
one day
FRANCIE

(leaning close to

her mother whispering)
Mama

(Katie leans closer)
I got a nickel if you want to leave
it People do

KATIE
Itll be all right Francie
(she leans back)
You know somethin They aint goin
to be the last diplomas either I
dont know how were goin to work
it but--

Her speech is interrupted by the arrival at the table of two
boys one Auggie whom we have seen before about Neeleys
age The other a little older

AUGGIE
Hi Neeley how you doin

NEELEY
(indicating his diploma)
Okay I got out o jail

HERSCHEL
(Auggies older brother)
Nice goin Say wasnt it you I saw

NEELEY
(flattered)
Yeah but--
HERSCHEL

(with phony enthusiasm)
Say you were pretty good You know

some pointers some day

NEELEY
Honest
HERSCHEL
Sure I will
(looking at
the others)

That is if your ma dont mind
NEELEY
Naw she wont mind

The obviousness of his attempt to get introduced is apparent
to both Katie and Sissy It amuses them

HERSCHEL
Well Ill see you on the lot
(stalling)
Maybe you better ask your ma I
dont want to do nothin she wouldnt
want me to

NEELEY
Aw she wouldnt care

SISSY

(grinning and coming

to Herschels rescue)
Maybe you better ask her yourself

HERSCHEL
Herschel Knutsen

SISSY
Mr Knutsen Id like for you to

HERSCHEL

(to break the silence
that has ensued)
Nice night if it dont rain Why

Herschel does so promptly next to Francie

HERSCHEL

HERSCHEL

interested Francie hesitates and then passes the feminine
crisis beautifully

FRANCIE
Well I -- I might be busy Ill let

HERSCHEL
(docilely)

Well Ill come around and see

NEELEY
I thought we was goin to play ball
tomorrow

HERSCHEL

We can do that any time sure

Both Neeley and Auggie are overwhelmingly disgusted with the
feet of clay that Herschel has shown

AUGGIE
(disgusted)
Aw come on Hersch

HERSCHEL
(getting up)
Well Ill be seein you Miss Nolan

Francie smiles but doesnt answer and Herschel and Auggie
leave Francie has made her first conquest

NEELEY
(in pain)
Him mushy
SISSY

Im proud of you chickabiddy You
handled him fine

Francie is flustered but it is very pleasant

KATIE
(smiling)
Its the hair that done it
(then reluctantly)
I hate to bust up the party but --
them babies got to be fed

SISSY
Steve will need a little somethin
too -- Three hours with the both of

em
They make preparations to leave The waiter enters with the
check Katie puts a half dollar on the table

WAITER
Thirty out of fifty

He starts to take out some change Katie hesitates looks at
Francie and then at Johnnys roses Then she gets to her
feet

KATIE
Keep the change

It is a decision monumental in its importance Francies
eyes shine as she looks at her mother

WAITER
(surprised)
Thank you maam

SISSY
Why Katie Nolan

KATIE
I dont care Theres times when
feelin good and -- and things like

that is important I dont care

They gather their things and start out Neeley takes a last
noisy pull at the straw in his drink As they start out
Francie walks next to Katie

As they get to the door and the others pass through
Francie hesitates a moment

FRANCIE
(shyly to Katie)
You -- you want to carry my flowers

mama

Katie looks down at her a little tremulously Their eyes
meet and things are fine Katie takes the flowers a little
awkwardly It is the measure of their sharing of Johnny
They start out together Francie is close beside her as the
scene dissolves out

The NOLAN KITCHEN dissolves in as Katie Sissy Francie and
Neeley are just entering Their spirits are high
AD LIBS
You missed it Steve How are the
babies

They stop short as they see McShane sitting at the table
with Uncle Steve Each holds a sleeping baby McShane gets
to his feet embarrassed

MCSHANE
Im beggin your pardon maam but
I just dropped in and your brother-
in-law seemed to be needin a little
help and the baby didnt seem to
mind I hope Im not intruding

KATIE
Not at all Mr McShane

SISSY
Sit right down were just goin
(she takes her baby)
Come along Steve

KATIE
(to McShane)
Ill take her Mr McShane

MCSHANE
Id like it if youd leave her Her
and me has got to be good friends

Katie hesitates and then complies Francie moves about
putting her flowers in water Sissy and Steve are getting
ready to go

KATIE
(to Sissy)
I wish you wouldnt hurry

SISSY
Got to get this family of mine home
Steves got his milk to deliver toa
lot more babies that like that
bottled kind

They move toward the door Katie goes with them

SISSY
(grinning and
whispering to Katie)
Quit frownin Katie The fellers
dont go for that at all

Katie flushes but has no answer Sissy is enjoying the
situation thoroughly

SISSY
(to the others)
Goodbye kids So long Mac

MCSHANE
(grinning a little)
Goodbye Mrs Edwards

FRANCIE
(coming closer)
Thank you Aunt Sissy

Sissy ruffles her hair a little then suddenly bends and
kisses her Sissy and Steve go Suddenly there is a little
constraint in the room

KATIE
Well I -- Ill take the baby off
you now Mr McShane

She does and sits down across the kitchen table from him
McShane doesnt know quite what to do with the blanket that
has been across his lap Conversation lags for a moment

MCSHANE
You -- you got a nice family Mrs
Nolan

KATIE

Thank you Mr McShane

There is another silence and then McShane gets to his feet
He has something to say but doesnt know how to go about
it Then he takes a long breath

MCSHANE
Mrs Nolan likely youre wonderin
why I came here tonight Let your
wonderin be over I came ona
personal matter

He pauses and clears his throat Francie looks at her
mother uncertainly

FRANCIE
Mama shall I go and--

MCSHANE

No Dont be leavin children My
conversation would be concernin you
as well as your mother

(he clears his

throat again)
Mrs Nolan I feel it is no
disrespect to speak my mind at this
time The last thing Id intend
would be any disrespect But -- I
mean Im in line for a sergeancy
now and I feel that it has been a
decent interval since the passin of
Mrs McShane God rest her soul--

KATIE
I didnt know Mr McShane Im
sorry

MCSHANE

I said nothing Mrs Nolan because
it was near the time of your own
bereavement and I didnt wish --
that is I know it is barely six
months now since your husband too
left this world rest his soul --
But intendin no disrespect -- and
even without the sergeancy I feel
Im in a position to speak my mind
now So that when you feel a decent
interval has elapsed Im -- Im
askin to start keepin company with
you Katharine Nolan with the object
of a weddin when -- when a decent
time has elapsed

There is a silence Katie looks first at Francie Francie
smiles a little Then Katie looks up at McShane

KATIE

(very simply)
For my part I will be glad to keep
company with you Mr McShane Not
for the help you offer because I
know wed manage some way But
because you are a good man Mr
McShane

MCSHANE

Theres one more thing Theres
little enough I can be offerin to
such a fine family but its little
enough Id be askin of the children
Their father was a fine man and Id
have no wish to be tryin to take
his place It would be my intention
to be more like -- like a real good
friend

(directly to Francie)
As the eldest could you be
approvin

His understanding about her father has been the winning
stroke with Francie She looks at him squarely

FRANCIE
Yes Mr McShane
MCSHANE
I was thinkin it wouldnt be right
that I should ever ask the two
oldest to take my name But the

little one -- the one that never
looked on her father -- Would you
think of letting me legally adopt
her
KATIE
(smiling ever
so little)

If that time comes the child shall
have your name

MCSHANE
(drawing a deep
breath of relief
Now Im wonderin if I could smoke

my pipe

KATIE
You could have smoked any time Mr
McShane

MCSHANE

I didnt want to be takin privileges
before I was entitled to em

He fishes for his pipe with enormous relief -- Francie
comes to her mother and starts to take the baby from her

FRANCIE
Help me put her to bed Neeley

NEELEY
Why

FRANCIE
To fix the blankets

She starts for the bedroom giving Neeley a gesture with
her head for him to follow Left alone with McShane Katie
goes to the stove

KATIE
Ill just heat up the coffee Will
you join me in a cup Mr McShane

MCSHANE
Thank you Katharine I will

In the BEDROOM Francie and Neeley are putting the baby in
the basket

FRANCIE
(with a superior air)
They want to be alone Theyve got
things to talk over

Oh

NEELEY

They finish tucking in the sleeping baby Francie goes to
the window and looks out She is in a strange mood

FRANCIE
Neeley -- lets go up on the roof
NEELEY
Okay
He laughs
FRANCIE

Whats the matter

NEELEY

He called her Katharine

Francie smiles too and as they start out the scene

dissolves to the ROOF

where Francie and Neeley are leaning

against the parapet looking out at the world

FRANCIE

Annie Laurie McShane

Yeah

NEELEY

FRANCIE

Shell never have the hard times we

did will she

NEELEY

Shell never have the fun either

FRANCIE

We did have fun didnt we when we

were young

NEELEY

FRANCIE

Remember those olden days when we

collected junk

Poor Laurie

NEELEY

FRANCIE

Neeley look at the tree its
growing again just like papa said
(after a little pause)

I -- I feel kind of sad like --

NEELEY
Yeah

Again theres a little pause

FRANCIE
Neeley

NEELEY
Uh-huh

FRANCIE

Am I good looking

NEELEY

FRANCIE
No honest Neeley I want to know

NEELEY
(grudgingly)
Youll pass

This is high tribute from Neeley Francie smiles happily

FRANCIE
Youre sweet Neeley

NEELEY
Aw cut the mush

Content they gaze out over the world which their diplomas
have made theirs as the scene fades out

Screenplay by Tess Slesinger and Frank Davis
Additional dialogue by an uncredited Anita Loos
Adapted from the novel by Betty Smith (Elizabeth Lillian Wehner)
The authors original ending

In the manuscript of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn in the archives
of the Southern Historical Collection in Chapel Hill
after the death of the father The two children Francie and Neeley
are sitting miserably at the kitchen table looking forward to a life
of increased poverty and hunger Author Betty Smith writes with
her characteristic mixture of sentimentality and despair Francie

says

TI believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and His
mother Holy Mary Jesus was a baby like we
were once And he went barefoot in the summer
like we do I saw a picture And he had no
shoes on He lived like other people lived and
He went fishing like papa did once He was
always where there were poor people She
made the sign of the cross as every Catholic
does when speaking of Jesus

Then she put her hand on Neeleys knee

But I will say now and I will always say - To
hell with God

Neeley put his hand on Francies hand and
echoed fearfully

To hell with God

the novel ends
