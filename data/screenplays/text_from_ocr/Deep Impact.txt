Deep Impact

SPACE

Deep dark Stars distant planets silence The universe
spreading out before us in all of its terrifying mystery
Inviting seductive The dark edge of an infinite lethal
precipice daring us to jump

It BLURS OUT OF FOCUS And back Brilliant SHARP The
soft CLICK of a SHUTTER It hangs open for an eternity
Then CLOSES The WHINE of film advancing Were ina --

STATE PARK IN VIRGINIA - NIGHT

With a pretty girl SARAH no more than fourteen taking
photos of the night sky through her small telescope Shes
surrounded by a dozen other telescopes three or four feet
long reflectors and refractors

TEENAGERS a few adults all take pictures of the night

sky using cameras attached to their telescopes The
SHUTTERS open close The camera motors ADVANCE

The teacher MR PERRY supervises
WE MOVE TO

LEO BIEDERMAN whose interest in the sky is almost equal to
his interest in Sarah

LEO
Matt Sheperd

Sarah doesnt look up from her telescope
SARAH
He asked me Its just a party

LEO
To you maybe

PERRY

Perry behind Leo Leo returns to his telescope

Leo stares through the telescope hesitates Finally

LEO

SARAH

LEO
No its not
SARAH
You said you didnt know
LEO
I know where Megrez is Im talking

about the other thing

He stands up for Perry to take a look So does Sarah
through her telescope

LEO (CONTD)
South about ten degrees

Leo cant help but glance down as Sarahs jeans part from
her lower back when she leans over the telescope

PERRY
(eye in the viewer)
Probably a satellite

LEO
(distracted)
Huh

As Perry starts to walk away
PERRY
(an afterthought)
Take a picture and send it to Dr
Wolf

SARAH

Leo looks through his telescope at this distant light
SNAPS the shutter and --

THE SCREEN GOES BLACK
REMOTE OBSERVATORY - NIGHT
And then the black begins to OPEN A platform moving

dim white running lights glide along the smooth circular
sides of the massive dome above us

A huge telescope swings slowly into place beneath a crystal
clear night sky

SUPERIMPOSED ON SCREEN A SINGLE WORD SKYWATCH

Silhouetted against the brilliant stars a man plumes of
white breath escaping into the bitter desert darkness
MARCUS WOLF He releases the telescope from its clamps
LOOKS DOWN at the mirror as it swings into position Wolf
steps off walks back to the --

OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

FLICKS off the white running lights as he goes bathing
the scene in red Studies the sky on a large computer (no
one looks through an eyepiece anymore) He picks up an
envelope leaning against the monitor In it photographs
of the stars and a group shot Perry and his kids Leo
and Sarah hold up a sign LEE HIGH SCHOOL ASTRONOMY CLUB
Wolf grabs a slice of congealing pizza from a picked-over
Dominos box shuffles the kids photos Not much of
interest Stops at one A beat Turns it over finds
the scrawled coordinates indicating its location in the
sky Intrigued he walks back into --

THE DOME - NIGHT

Controls the telescope with the kind of simple buttons you
find on a hospital bed Up Down Left Right The huge
motors GRIND as the telescope moves

The sky changes above us as he jogs back to — -

THE OBSERVATION ROOM

The image on the monitor rotates LOCKS into place He
compares the screen to the photo Smiles

WOLF
Hello do I know you where
are you going in such a hurry

Taps in a command the cursor squares on one area of the
image ENLARGES He stares enters the ascension and
declination directions and observation time Numbers race
by trajectories speed Finally

WOLF (CONTD)
--oh shit

Drops his slice of pizza into the trash swings around to
his open laptop Double clicks on his AOL folder

The familiar AOL gateway graphic POPS up

The modem CLICKS on a DIALTONE followed by rapid DIALING
He rolls back to the mainframe hunts around for an empty
disk slaps it in begins the download

The modem SQUAWKS A BUSY SIGNAL The modem disconnects
then CLICKS alive again Dials the back-up number as Wolf
EJECTS the downloaded disk from the mainframe Wheels
back to his portable just in time to be met by

VOICE (VO)
All circuits are busy please try
your call again later

The modem CLICKS off the screen returns to the AOL
gateway

WOLF

He grabs a manilla envelope quickly addresses it to

A battered Jeep Wrangler Wolf leaps in ROARS off down
the mountain The observatory looms behind him

A trucker MCCLOUD in the cab of a semi a six-pack of
Jolt Colas on the seat the RADIO BLARING country

WOLFS CAR - NIGHT 11
Wolf listens to Puccini The Jeep speeds around the snowy
mountain curves shakily as he attempts to dial his portable
cellular phone and stay on the road

TRUCK - NIGHT 12

Puccini collides with Garth Brooks as McCloud guzzles his
Jolts A long cigarette ash dangles from his lip

WOLF

And finally a voice answers

Wolf holds the phone down in front of him trying to dial
the numbers steer and keep an eye on the road all at
once Dialing wins out

TRUCK - NIGHT 14

The cigarette ash fills the screen We know its going to
drop We wonder when

MCCLOUD
--Oh fuck

His hand dances wildly searching for the hot ash

Wolfs Jeep rounds the bend in the wrong lane McClouds
hand digs between his legs the ash burns his fingers as
Wolfs lights BLIND him Wolf SCREAMS McCloud YANKS the
wheel the semi SKIDS

MCCLOUD
-Jesus

The collision is a ballet of destruction the drama of two
bodies trying to occupy the same space at the same time

The mass of the truck dominates the Jeep The Jeeps small
frame has nowhere to go but back into itself Abstractly
this is sculpture at the moment this is death

Flying glass is everywhere The Jeeps canvas roof SHREDS
and flails Its engine pushes the steering column up into
the cab The semi shoves the Jeep up and through the

guardrail twisting metal and wood BURSTING out into space

The Jeep SURGES end over end down the side of the mountain
towards the snowy woods a hundred yards below

The MANILLA ENVELOPE WITH THE COMPUTER DISK soars out of
the rags that were the Jeeps roof For a moment it lands
at the foot of a snowy evergreen An EXPLOSION and a
massive rush of air send it further into the wintery
forest

ON THE ROAD ABOVE - NIGHT 16

McCloud falls from the truck cab drags himself up stumbles
to the edge of the cliff picking his way through the strewn
glass and metal Grabs a roadsign for support blood runs
down his face He stares through the twisted guardrail down
into the canyon at the burning wreckage until

A second EXPLOSION drives him back from the edge and we
PULL AWAY Finally able to read the large yellow roadsign

A few men are there waiting MORTON ENTREKIN steps
forward 40s hip Southern shirtsleeves The kitchen

counters are covered with food from an interrupted luncheon

clean-up

ENTREKIN
Morton Entrekin Ms Lerner

He offers his hand She thinks about this then takes it
Everyone is watching her no one gives anything away
Theres another few jars of that damned Ensure Whats
going on

JENNY
MSNBC They know what I am working
on they expect from me and I

think they should

ENTREKIN
People knew about the Manhattan
Project and they kept it secret

JENNY
And that was just the creation of
the atom bomb

ENTREKIN
You do understand Hundreds of
thousands of people kept that
secret Thats how we won World
War Two Thousands are keeping
this secret

JENNY
Im a reporter

ENTREKIN

With no concern for national
security

( ) 38

Jenny is thoroughly confused trying desperately to figure
out what hes talking about without revealing her ignorance
But hes not watching her hes still waiting An FBI agent
picks luncheon meat off a large deli platter eats

What the hell is going on

The double doors BURST open and PRESIDENT BECK enters
followed by Secret Service Agents To say he enters doesnt
quite explain it his presence seems to proceed him as if
hes the dawn sun just breaking the horizon

BECK
Ms Lerner Tom Beck I understand
youve come into a little

information

Jenny stands there as if slapped Beck offers the smile
that got him elected Holy shit the waters suddenly
very deep

ENTREKIN
Ms Lerner was just expressing her
lack of enthusiasm for matters of
national security when journalist
competitiveness is at stake

Beck nods seeming to agree with Jenny The reasonable
understanding father the legislative compromiser Jennys
staring at him Hes not unaware of the effect hes having
on her She takes a deep breath plays her only card

JENNY
(fighting now to collapse in
front of the man)
At this moment Mr President I am
not interested in using Ellie to
further my career

When she says the word Ellie the President studies her
He wants to speak to her as someone he can trust

BECK
So what do you know about ELE

When Jenny hears the phrase ELE something snaps into
place She realizes she has a card to play for the first
time since she was taken here

JENNY
I know you should have chosen a
better cover story than a sick
wife

Beck looks unhappily to Entrekin

BECK
You see What did I say

Entrekin holds up his hands guilty as charged

BECK (CONTD)
We always thought that the deadline
for going public was the publication
of the budget Weve spent more
money than we could hide But the
budget comes out in two weeks I
dont suppose I can convince you to
sit on this for two weeks

JENNY
Theres no such thing as two weeks
in the news business

BECK
And I cant appeal to your sense
of whats in the nations best
interest

JENNY
I always thought the truth was in
the nations best interest

Beck and Entrekin look at each other

ENTREKIN
Should we hold her

BECK
What if we went public in forty-
eight hours Thats doable isnt
it

ENTREKIN
Itd be very difficult

BECK

If she knows how many days before
The Post or CNN break the story
This was never going to be a secret
as long as you wanted it to be
Morton

(back to Jenny)
If you give us two days you get
second row center at the White
House press conference And from
what I know about your career
thats a promotion

She considers this She has to play a big card
JENNY

I want exclusivity

BECK
Now you listen to me Ms Lerner
This is a Presidential favor Im

letting you go because I dont want
another headache and Im trusting
you because I know what this can do
for your career Somehow we have
each other over the same barrel

But who really has the power in this
room

Hes scary and theyre eye to eye But she is still strong
enough for one last volley

JENNY

I want the first question
BECK

Want
JENNY

May I May I have the first question

The President continues teleprompter feeding him his words

BECK
Now we get hit every day by rocks
and meteors some of them are the
size of cars and some of them the
size of your hand But the comet
we discovered is the size of New
York City from Central Park to the
tip of the Island about seven
miles long Put another way the
comet is larger than Mount Everest
and weighs five hundred billion
tons

The room stirs reporters stare at each other Jennys
rapt she knew the punch line but not the joke

BECK (CONTD)
Chances are this thing will miss
us because comets arent on
railroad tracks theyre sliding
and side-slipping through space
But this one is too big for us to
just cross our fingers and hope it
scoots on by So tonight I want
to tell you what I can about what
were doing to take care of the
comet before theres even a chance
it might hit us And if the grown-
ups of the world dont mind right
now I want to talk to the children
of the world

building the largest spaceship
ever constructed its being built
in orbit around the earth We
call it the Messiah I want to
emphasize that some scientists
argued that there was no reason to
spend the time and money to
intercept something that probably
wont hit us but we decided not
to take that risk And right now
a team of American astronauts and
one Russian are at Cape Canaveral
in Florida In two months they
will leave on the Shuttle to board
the Messiah this is the crew that
will stop the comet

of monitors every station carrying the speech

Lets call the big one Wolf and
the smaller piece Biederman

Wolf is six miles wide Biederman
a mile and a half Separately or
together they are capable of
destroying life as we know it We
have lost communication with the
Messiah spacecraft although we
continue to track it visually It
left the comet under power and has
made course corrections under
power The ship is coming home
We dont know how many are alive
We dont know their condition

He takes a moment All stare the words sinking in

BECK (ON TV) (CONTD)
Now we have to make some decisions
together What do we do You have
a choice we have a choice right
now Ever since the comet was
discovered weve been hoping and
working for the best but weve
also been planning for the worst
Our strategy has been two-fold
First our Strategic Missile
Command is preparing to coordinate
with the Russians a massive strike
of Titan missiles to intercept the
incoming comets If we can deflect
these comets only two degrees they
will bounce harmlessly off of our
atmosphere and head out into
space

only a few hours away and while we
are confident the Missile attack
will succeed it is only prudent
that we now take cautionary steps
to insure the continuation of our
way of life To guarantee that
there will be enough of us left to
rebuild a new world in the unlikely
event that the comets do strike the
earth

to use faith as a weapon But I
still want to offer a prayer and
Ive been trying to find the right
one So let me offer this It’ll
pray for our survival mine

God hears all prayers but I also

When your Father and I were young
I used to think of us as the

and he always said I was the most

deceptive and beauty is passing

The comets from the point of view of the missiles
AND FROM THE MISSILES POV

The comets are immense and from this angle we finally
understand the futility of what is about to happen

One by one the tiny missiles STRIKE the surface Pebbles
smashing into two very large ponds

MSNBC — NIGHT

Across the monitors the faces of people watching in
Beijing and Nairobi London and Rio Eric Beth Caitlin
Worth Stuart Ira Marianne Bobby On Jennys monitor a
graphic representation of the missiles striking the comet
surface

JENNY
Heres what youre looking at
all the Titans have hit their
targets but we still dont know
if theyve made a difference
Comets have to travel for awhile
before the radar tracking
stations can see if they have
been pushed to a safe course
thatll bypass the earth So
one more time we have to wait

stopped in a church for confession
And in the dark of that
confessional he told the priest
about the chess game and how Death
had overlooked a move and how he
the Knight was just one jump away
from a checkmate And the priest
pulled back the screen and it was
Death himself The Knight had
given away his game

Everyones listening now lost in their own emotions

TANNER (CONTD)
There was no chance to recover He
was going to lose The Knight went
outside and he looked at his hands
and he could see the blood still
flowing in his veins and he said
There it is Im still alive and
I Antonius Block - that was his
name - I Antonius Block am playing
Chess with Death

Wolf begins heating up as the Messiah ROARS into the vent
swallowed whole

Nothing Didnt it work And then a BLINDING light SHOOTS
out and BOOM Everything goes WHITE

THE HILLSIDE 313

Leo and Sarah sit up in the middle of the flooded road
The water draining away as the wave recedes Sarah still
has the CRYING baby in her arms

LEO
--look

THE SKY overhead far away Wolf and a brilliant light
followed by a massive rolling wave of THUNDER that shakes
the earth They walk to the edge of the road look out
over the valley the ocean slowly receding below

SARAH
Its going away

And then all the pieces from the explosion begin HITTING
the atmosphere The greatest meteor shower in history
FIREWORKS in the day brighter than at night The entire
sky filled with color and light STREAKING BURNING

Leo cant speak Sarah holds Leo the baby The baby
stares at the sky the ocean mesmerized Begins to
LAUGH

THE END
