Harold and Maude by Colin HigginsHarold and Maude

FADE IN
INT THE CHASENS DEN - DAY

The CAMERA is at floor level A young man enters but we
see only his shoes and the cuffs of his pants We TRACK
with him as he walks across the room and stops at a record
player Pause We HEAR a record drop and begin playing

a light classical melody The SUPERIMPOSED TITLES BEGIN
After a moment the feet move off and we TRACK with them

past a low table and around a couch to the window curtains

The feet pause there for a moment A piece of heavy
window cord drops INTO FRAME We FOLLOW as it is dragged
along to the low table Then the feet move over to a large
ornate desk The cord is pulled up OUT OF FRAME Pause
The feet walk over to a chair by the wall It is picked
up carried to the center of the room and carefully
placed Pause The feet get up onto the chair and the
CAMERA RISES to their level They shuffle about for a
moment At an appropriate musical break the CREDITS STOP
Suddenly the feet knock over the chair and drop into
space They kick about for a bit then go slack and still
The FINAL CREDITS are SUPERED OVER the suspended appendages
while the music comes to a lilting conclusion As we HEAR
the record player turn itself off the CAMERA BEGINS a
half circle tour around the hanging feet and stops at the
heels Pause Outside we HEAR a womans footsteps
approaching and we change focus as the door to the den
opens Through the blurred hanging feet we see a tall
middle-aged fashionably dressed woman enter and we PAN
with her as she walks to the desk This is MRS CHASEN
She seems rather tired and preoccupied as she begins to
remove her long white gloves Slowly the CAMERA BEGINS a
vertical rise up the side of the hanging corpse until we
are watching Mrs Chasen over his left shoulder The rope
and his stretched neck frame the right side of the SCREEN
We hold Mrs Chasen puts down her gloves and looks up
(NOTE THE ABOVE IS ALL ONE CONTINUOUS SHOT)

4 INT DEN - MEDIUM SHOT - MRS CHASEN - DAY

She stares at the body for several beats and then with
weary exasperation sits down at the desk and dials the
telephone As she waits for an answer she looks up at the
hanging body

MRS CHASEN
I suppose you think this is very
funny Harold

5 CLOSEUP HAROLD

The rope chokes his throat his eyes bulge his tongue
hangs out

They are all in evening clothes and are laughing as Mrs
Chasen in a dress of white ostrich feathers continues a
witty story

MRS CHASEN
Needless to say the first time it
happened I was absolutely abashed
I was so shook I needed three
tranquilizers to calm me down
Well you can imagine Suicide
notes all over the house - Goodbye
Farewell Arrivederci Other
children pretend to run away from
home but Harold - hes so dramatic

Everyone laughs The CAMERA BEGINS PULLING BACK and
PANNING past the guests till we come to Harold sitting
morosely at the other end of the table He listlessly toys
with his food as his mother continues

MRS CHASEN
Of course Harolds father had a
similar sense of the absurd I
remember once in Paris he stepped
out for cigarettes and the next I
hear hes arrested for floating
nude down the Seine - experimenting
in river currents with a pair of
yellow rubber water wings Well
that cost quite a little bit of
enfluence and dargent to
hush up I can tell you Harold
dear stop playing with your food
Dont you feel well

HAROLD
(looks up and
pauses)
I have a sore throat

MRS CHASEN
Well I want you to go to bed
directly after dinner You know
how susceptible you are to colds
Harold has always been a delicate
child Even as a baby he seemed
to be abnormally prone to illness
- Harold dear eat up your beets

gown a cover for her hair and she has just finished
putting on several different face creams She gets up
walks over to the bathroom and opens the door Blood is
everywhere -- on the walls the floor the mirror - and in
the tub is Harold his throat slit and his wrists dripping
blood onto the razor on the tile floor The effect is one
of instant shock Mrs Chasen screams and backs up in
horror Sobbing hysterically she clutches her robe about
her and rushes from the room crying

MRS CHASEN
Oh No Oh No I cant stand
it My God This is too much
This is too much to bear

The CAMERA WATCHES Mrs Chasen run off and then swings back
to Harold in the tub

We hold on his wretched face as his mothers hysterical
cries are heard in the background Harold moves his head
and listens He breaks into a sly satisfied grin

PSYCHIATRIST

21 INSERT - STOCK

A giant steel ball crashes into a building We watch it
fall noisily into dust and rubble

22 INT PSYCHIATRISTS OFFICE - DAY

PSYCHIATRIST

Thats very interesting Harold
and I think very illuminative
There seems to be a definite pattern
emerging

(taking copious notes)
Your fondness for useless machines
and demolitions seems indicative
of your present emotional state
your self-destructive urges and
your alienation from the regular
social interaction What do you
think And of course this pattern
once isolated can be coped with
Recognize the problem and you are
half way on the road to its
solution But tell me what do
you do for fun What activity
gives you a different sense of
enjoyment than the others What
do you find fulfilling What
gives you that certain satisfaction

HAROLD
I go to funerals

somewhat stunned Harold gets out of the hearse and goes

into the backyard The two women look to Mrs Chasen
some explanation Mrs Chasen smiles lamely

INT CHASENS DEN - DAY
Mrs Chasen is addressing a seated and mute Harold

MRS CHASEN
Why you purchased that monstrous
thing is totally beyond me You
can have any car you want - a Porsche
a Jaguar a nice little MG roadster
- but that ugly black horror is an
eyesore and an embarrassment
Really Harold you are no longer
a child Its time for you to
settle down and stop flitting away
your talents on these amateur
theatrics - your little
divertissements - no matter how
psychologically purging they may
be I dont know what to do

poster of bullet-

blazing Marines)
- working for peace and - are
serving your country

He stops before a poster of Nathan Hale with a noose about
his neck

UNCLE VICTOR
(continuing)
Like Nathan Hale Thats what this
country needs - more Nathan Hales

He pulls his lanyard activating some weird mechanism which
snaps up his empty sleeve into a natty salute A pause
The sleeve smartly refolds and he turns to Harold

UNCLE VICTOR
(softly)
And Harold I think I can see a
little Nathan Hale in you

30 INT CHASENS DEN - DAY
Mrs Chasen is going out but she comes in to talk to Harold

MRS CHASEN
I only have a few minutes Harold
but I do want to inform you of my
decision There is no doubt that
it is time for you to settle down
and begin thinking about your
future You have led a very
carefree idle happy life up to
the present - the life of a child
But it is time now to put away
childish things and take on adult

And so dear brethren let us pray
to the Lord King of Glory that

pains of hell and the bottomless
pit deliver them from the lions

eternal rest

During the above we PULL BACK to reveal an open coffin and

a church spreckled with a few mourners in black

closed and the pallbearers take it out the side door The
few mourners follow

Maude is now sitting next to Harold

MAUDE
Ill never understand this mania
for black I mean no one sends
black flowers do they Black
flowers are dead flowers and who
would send black flowers to a
funeral Its change

(fluttery laugh)

How absurd

Her eye catches a dour portrait of the Blessed Virgin and
Child on a pillar With one swoop she takes a felt pen
from Harolds breast pocket and draws on the painting a
bright and cheery smile

Harold is stunned

MAUDE

There thats better They never
give the poor thing a chance to
laugh Heaven knows she has a lot
to be happy about In fact

(she looks thought-

fully around the

church)
- they all have a lot to be happy
about Excuse me

delightfully ridiculous smiles drawn on their faces
CLOSEUP - PRIEST

In the same rhythm we have a FIFTH CUT - the returning
priest who is dropped dead by what he sees

MAUDE
Do you dance

HAROLD

With a great screech of burning rubber Maude drives down

Chasen remains impervious to it all

than on conversation

MAUDE
And so just before he left for the
monastery in Tibet Big Sweeney
gave me his keys

She is showing Harold her ring of car keys

MAUDE
(continuing)
Of course Ive had to make some
additions for the new models but
not as many as you might think
Once you have your basic set its
then only a question of variation

HAROLD
And you get into any car you want
and just drive off

MAUDE
Not any car I like to keep a
variety Im always looking for
the new experience like this one
I liked it

HAROLD
Thank you But when you take these
cars dont you think you are
wronging the owners

MAUDE
What owners Harold We dont
own anything Its a transitory
world We come on the earth with
nothing and we go out with nothing
so isnt ownership a little
absurd

HAROLD
Still I think youd upset
people and Im not sure thats
right

Well if some people are upset
because they feel they have a hold
on some things then Im merely
acting as a gentle reminder - Im
sort of breaking it easy -- Here
today gone tomorrow so dont get
attached to things Now with that
in mind Im not against collecting
stuff

53 INT MAUDES APARTMENT - DAY
Maude and Harold enter

MAUDE
Ive collected quite a lot of
stuff in my time

We see Maudes main room filled with all kinds of eccentric
memorabilia from a mounted swordfish to an ivory Buddha
It is dominated by a large canopied bed like something from
a Wagnerian opera Other features are a large fireplace

a baby grand piano expensive paintings on the walls a
tall wooden sculpture and a Japanese type eating area with
satin cushions

MAUDE
Its all memorabilia but incidental
and not integral if you know what
I mean

HAROLD
(looks around amazed)
Its very interesting

MAUDE
Oh look The birds

She goes to the window and works a unique pulley device that
delivers seed to the bird table in the back yard

MAUDE

This is my daily ritual I love
them so much The only wild life
I see anymore Free as a bird

(fluttery laugh)
You know at one time used to
break into pet shops and liberate
the canaries but I gave it up
as an idea before its time The
zoos are full and the prisons
overflowing

vegetables in the backyard The old woman does not
notice Maude

fashioned Please sit down Harold

PSYCHIATRIST

HAROLD
I burnt down the Chemistry building

The psychiatrist gets up and rather anxiously paces about

PSYCHIATRIST
We are not relating today Harold
I sense a definite resistance
A lack of true and helpful
communication I find you a very
interesting case Harold but
this reluctance of yours is
detrimental to the psycho-analytical
process and can only hinder the
possibility of effective treatment
Do you understand

HAROLD
Yes

PSYCHIATRIST
Very well

Now your mother tells me she is
arranging several dates for you
with some young ladies How do
you feel about that

All the lights are on showing a room cluttered with books
guns and swords on the walls small bits of odd machinery
a chemistry workbench a school pennant some trophies
some models a chess set etc

HAROLD (vo)
Oh all my things - incidental but
not integral if you know what I
mean

We PAN over individual items - the chemistry set pool
floats a small oxygen cylinder the rope and body harness
he used to hang himself in the first scene a large bottle
of Max Factor blood a portrait of Lon Chaney as The
Phantom of the Opera

We come to a silver serving dish with a large silver cover
over it A hand comes into frame and removes the cover
On the dish is Harolds severed head The hands pick up

the head We TILT UP and see it is Harold He takes the
dummy head over to his dresser combs the hair and picks
off the latex blood and then takes it to the center of the
room where a headless dummy sits in a chair Harold screws
the head onto the dummy It doesnt fit very well He
fiddles with it a moment but he is not satisfied He goes
to his closet and looks into a box of tools and things

He takes a meat cleaver out but he is still looking for
something else There is a knock on the door and Mrs
Chasen in evening clothes enters Harold turns to come out
of the closet but he hears his mother addressing the dummy

MRS CHASEN
Now listen Harold I have here the
three girls sent out by the Computer
Dating Service

She shuffles through three IBM cards in her hand

MRS CHASEN
(continuing)
Ive phoned them up and invited
each of them to have lunch with
us before you take them out The
first one is coming tomorrow at
one Luncheon at two

Harold stands with the meat cleaver in his hand behind the
closet door He listens blankly

MRS CHASEN
(still talking to
the dummy)
Now I want you to act like a
gentleman and make this girl
feel at home

Well Im off to the ballet with
the Fergusons I only hope they
can maneuver round that great black
thing in the driveway
(she pauses)
You look a little pale Harold
(she opens the door)
You get a good nights sleep After
all you want to look your best for
tomorrow
(she exits)

Harold hears the door shut He ponders his fate for a
moment He leans around the door and looks at the dummy

He thinks He gives it up He goes back in the closet
to find whatever he was looking for

little nonplussed Harold is pouring the kerosene all over

himself

MRS CHASEN

that Harold does have his eccentric

moments

CANDY

Candy begins hysterical babbling and collapses

INT MAUDES APARTMENT - DAY
The front door opens slowly and Harold enters

HAROLD
Maude Maude Anybody home

He gets no answer and steps into the room He looks over
the fireplace where a furled umbrella is hung up like a
rifle Nearby he sees a glass cabinet full of sea shells
and glass work He walks over to a large table and is
puzzled by the odd-shaped machine-like boxes on top He
looks over at the wood sculpture a highly polished work
with very smooth curves and holes Instinctively he puts
out his hand to touch it but decides he shouldnt He
walks over to the piano and examines the silver frames

standing on it They have no photographs in them and this

interests him He goes to the window Over his shoulder
we see MADAME AROUET hoeing in her vegetable patch

EXT THE BACK YARD - DAY

He goes off toward the building Madame Arouet continues
hoeing

CLOSEUP - MADAME AROUET

She looks up from her work and watches Harold There is a
strange sadness in her old weathered face - time lost
pleasures past over the resignation to a lifetime of work
She turns back to her garden

INT GLAUCUSS STUDIO - DAY

Harold comes through the door sees where he is at and
becomes embarrassed

HAROLD
Oh Excuse me

HAROLDS POV - AN ARTISTS STUDIO

The first thing we notice is the large block of ice in the
center of the room - seven to eight feet tall - and
through it as if looking through the glass on a shower
door we can see a naked female body posing as Venus The
sculptor GLAUCUS a frail little white-haired old man
dressed in winter clothing turns from the ice with a
chisel and hammer in his gloved hand

GLAUCUS
What do you want

HAROLD
Im sorry I was looking for
Maude

The nude figure behind the ice moves and we see her head
over the top It is Maude

Maude lays out the table Harold gets up He has some-
thing on his mind

HAROLD
(nonchalantly)
Do you often model for Glaucus

MAUDE

Heavens no I dont have the time
But I like to keep in practice
and poor Glaucus occasionally needs
his memory refreshed as to the
contours of the female form

(she stops)
Do you disapprove

HAROLD
Me No Of course not

MAUDE
(she wants
the truth)

Really Do you think its wrong

HAROLD
(thinks decides

MAUDE
Oh Im so happy you said that
because I wanted to show you my
paintings This is the Rape of
Rome and of course there in
the corner is quite a graphic
depiction of Leda and the Swan

Harold looks at the corner of the painting and then back at
Maude

MAUDE
(coquettishly)
A self-portrait
(she walks on)
But over here is my favorite Its
titled Rainbow with Egg Underneath
and an Elephant Do you like it

HAROLD
Yes Very much

MAUDE
It was my last I then became
infatuated with these -- my

Odorifics

She points to the odd-shaped boxes with the tubes and
handles attached to them

MAUDE

Give the nose a treat I thought
Have a kind of olfactory banquet
So I began first on the easiest -
roast beef old books mown grass
then I went on to these -

(she reads the

labels on the

boxes)

free-smelling - but then I decided
to switch to the tactile

She gestures at the wood sculpture

MAUDE
What do you think

HAROLD
Oh Eh I like it

MAUDE
No you have to touch it
(she demonstrates)
You have to run your hands over it
get close to it really reach
out and feel You try it

Harold tries He gingerly moves his hand over a rather

sensuous curve

MAUDE
Thats right Hows the sensation

A low RISING WHISTLE is heard

MAUDE
Oh thats the kettle
(she goes to
kitchen)
Go ahead Harold Stroke palm
caress explore

Harold watches Maude leave the room He hears her invita-
tion and looks at the sculpture A battle is going on

inside him (Go ahead touch it - Better not)

face is expressionless but he moves his body closer and
his hand becomes more daring He brings his other hand
onto the sculpture He is enjoying the sensations He
looks at the large hole before him His hand moves around

Suddenly he sticks his head in the hole pulls it out
steps back quickly and looks over to the kitchen Maude
is still out there humming Harold relaxes straightens

Maude enters with the tea

MAUDE

Shots of falling buildings The giant demolition ball
swings left and right knocking mighty holes in brick walls

Harold and Maude are sitting on a hill picnicking They
are looking at the junkyard operation in the distance

are lying on the ground looking intently at one little
plant Maude looks over to Harold

MAUDE
I love to watch things grow

EXT FLOWER FARM - DAY

SHOTS of flowers growing all different varieties in
clusters in pots on vines in greenhouses in large
fields

Maude and Harold are walking down a row of flowers

MAUDE
They grow and bloom and fade and
die and some change into something
else Ah life

They stop by some flowers

I should like to change into a
sunflower most of all They are
so tall and simple And you

See - some are smaller some are
fatter some grow to the left
some to the right some even have
some petals missing - all kinds
of observable differences and we
havent even touched the bio-
chemical You see Harold theyre
like the Japanese At first you
think they all look alike but
after you get to know them you see
there is not a repeat in the bunch
Each person is different never
existed before and never to exist
again Just like this daisy -

(she picks it)
- an individual

They stand up

HAROLD
Well we may be individuals all
right but -
(he looks out
at the field)
- we have to grow up together

Maude looks up She is very struck by what Harold said
She speaks very softly and we see she has tears in her eyes

MAUDE

Yes thats very true Still I
believe much of the worlds
sorrow comes from people who know
they are this -

(she holds

the daisy)
- yet let themselves be treated -

(she looks out

at the field)
- as that

INT GLAUCUSS STUDIO - NIGHT

Maude and Harold enter The block of ice in the center of
the room is now five to six feet tall and melting rapidly
into the large trough in which it stands Around the studio
on the walls and benches are every conceivable hand tool -
sculpting tools gardening tools construction tools etc
On a raised platform in one corner covered with rugs and
cushions and skins lies Glaucus bundled up in a parka

and snoring horribly In his gloved hands he holds a

hammer and an ice pick

MAUDE
Oh my Were too late

My umbrella

(fluttery laugh)
Oh thats just a relic I found
it when I was packing to come to
America It used to be my defense
on picket lines and rallies and
political meetings - being dragged
off by police or attacked by thugs
of the opposition

(fluttery laugh

as she remembers)
A long time ago

HAROLD
What were you fighting for

MAUDE

Oh Big Issues Liberty Rights
Justice Kings died and kingdoms
fell I dont regret the kingdoms
- what sense in borders and nations
and patriotism - but I do miss the
kings When I was a little girl
I was taken to the palace in
Vienna to a garden party I can
still see the sunshine the
parasols and the flashing
uniforms of the young officers
I thought then I would marry a
soldier

(fluttery laugh)
Later Frederick would chide me
about it

(with a twinkle)
He was so serious A doctor at
the University And in the
government

Suddenly she gets quiet

MAUDE
But that was all before

Maude stares into the fire She suddenly seems very small
and fragile Harold notices the change that has come over
her and is not sure what to say

So you dont use the umbrella
any more

MAUDE

(sparks back to

her old self)
Oh yes Every day But I dont
need a defense anymore I embrace
Still fighting for the Big Issues
but now in my small individual way
Shall we have a song

HAROLD
Well I dont

MAUDE
Oh come on Ill teach you

She goes to the piano sits down and plays It is a fast
delightful song and she sings it with zest

MAUDE
Come on Harold join in the
chorus

Beside her Harold hesitatingly sings along The os
orchestra has joined in enabling Maude to leave the piano
and get up and dance She capers in true old vaudeville
fashion As the song continues we go into a MONTAGE and

see Maude dance as she sings in various locales - the beach
the forest the fields the hills finally returning to

her room to join up with Harold for a socko finish

MAUDE
Oh that was fun Lets play
something together

HAROLD
But I dont play anything

MAUDE
(a bombshell)
Dont play anything Dear me Everyone
should be able to make some music
Why its life - Rhythm and
harmony — Thats the cosmic dance
Come with me

She goes over to a large cupboard and opens both doors
It is full of all kinds of musical instruments She ferrets

about for a while and pulls out a banjo

From the top -- Lets jam

She swings into the chorus and Harold strums along At the
end she looks over at him beaming

HAROLD
Okay

him and he quickly hides his banjo in a nearby flower pot
His mother enters

appropriate for you dont you
think

Harold starts to say something

MRS CHASEN

(continuing)
One more thing Harold Ive talked
on the phone with your second
computer date and she seems a very
nice quiet girl Not at all
hysterical like the first one
Nevertheless I want you to be on
your best behavior when she comes
tomorrow and make her feel at home

(she looks at the

car before leaving)
Cute little thing isnt it I
like it very much

(she exits)

Harold stands for a moment looking at the MG He makes a
decision

One moment

He makes a chip on the ice and stands back to examine it
He is satisfied He turns to Maude full of pep

GLAUCUS
Ah Dame Marjorie Greetings
(he kisses her hand)
As Odysseus said to Penelope

Harold enters a little out of breath

HAROLD
Sorry Im late

GLAUCUS
A rather free translation but
nonetheless correct Greetings
to you too my little one
(he gestures
at the ice)
Tell me what do you see

HAROLD
A block of ice

GLAUCUS
Exactly Now ask me what I see

HAROLD
What do you see

GLAUCUS
I see the eternal goddess of
beauty and love I see Aphrodite
The consummate woman

Full of warmth and fire Frozen
(to the ice)
And it is I who shall set you free

He takes a small pneumatic drill and attacks the ice He
makes a little incision puts it down and steps back to
observe He wipes his brow

GLAUCUS

Each morning I am delivered of a
new block of ice Each evening
my eyes grow weary my hands hang
heavy and I am swept down Lethe
to slumber -

(slowly with

feeling)
- while my goddess half-born
drips away - unseen unsung and
unknown

HAROLD

MAUDE
Yes Its almost there

Glaucus his eyes barely open gets up and shuffles in

his tools in the air and then shuffles in place as if he

They are relaxing on cushions in the Japanese nook after

HAROLD
Did Confucius say that

MAUDE
Well --
(she smiles)
- they say he was very wise so
Im sure he must have

HAROLD
You are the wisest person I know

MAUDE

Me

(she laughs and

shakes her head)
When I look around me I know I
know nothing I remember though
once long ago in Persia we met a
wise man in the bazaar He was
a professional and used to sell
his wisdom to anyone willing to
pay His specialty for tourists
was a maxim engraved on the head
of a pin The wisest he said
the truest the most instructive
words for all men at all times
Frederick bought one for me and
back at the hotel I peered through
a magnifying glass to read the
words - And this too shall pass
away

(fluttery laugh)
Well the wise man was right - if
you remember that you cant help
but live life fully

HAROLD
Yes I havent lived
(he suddenly

giggles)
Ive died a few times

What was that

HAROLD
(he is getting
a little high)

Died Seventeen times - not
counting maiming
(he laughs)

Shot myself in the face once with
a popgun and a pellet of blood

MAUDE
(laughing with him)
How ingenious Tell me about them

HAROLD
Well its a question of timing
and the right equipment and plenty
of patience You really want to
hear about this

MAUDE
Of course

HAROLD
(he smiles)
Okay

Partly because of the pot but mostly because he has found
a friend Harold opens up for the first time in his life
As he gets into the story he tells it with such animation
and delight that we are amazed at all the fun and zest he
has kept locked up inside him

HAROLD
Well the first time it wasnt
even planned It was when I was
at boarding school and they were
getting ready for the school
Centennial Celebration and they
put all the fireworks and food
and stuff in this room in the
West Wing Well on the floor
above they had the Chemistry Lab
and I had to stay in and clean
it up So I thought Id doa
little experimenting I got all
this stuff out and began mixing
it up It was very scientific
I was measuring the amounts
Well suddenly there was this big
fizzing sound and this white kind
of porridge stuff began erupting
out of the beaker and moving along
the desk and falling onto the floor
It was making an awful mess So I
got the hose to try to spray it

haroldandmaudehomepagecomxhigginnsscreenplaytxt

59105
3612 haroldandmaudehomepagecomxhigginnsscreenplay txt

into the sink I turned on the
water and - POW There was this
massive explosion Knocked me down
Blew out the floor Boards and
brick and flames leaping up Singed
my hair Smoke everywhere I got

up then this sound like bombs
going off It was the fireworks

in the room below And all this
stuff came flying out the hole
PACHAU Skyrockets and pinwheels
And fire balls all whizzing and
bouncing And I was just standing
there stunned - I couldnt believe
it - just watching - being pelted
by all these little pellets - turns
out to be the goddamn popcorn spewed
up from below The whole place was
a crazy inferno with the rockets
and everything and I couldnt get
to the door But behind me was

this old laundry chute so I

hopped in that and slid down that to
the basement When I got outside

I saw that the whole top of the
building was on fire and of course
it was pandemonium with people
running around and fire alarms
ringing So I decided to go home
When I get there my mother is having
this big party so I creep up the
back stairs to my room Then there
is this ring on the doorbell Its
the police I creep over to the
banister to see what they say and
they tell my mother that I had

been killed in a fire at school
Well everyone got very quiet

Harold has calmed down and speaks in a matter of fact way

HAROLD
(continuing)
People were whispering and looking
at my mother

I tried leaning forward to see her
face but I couldnt
(slowly)
She began to sway She put one
hand to her forehead With the
other she reached out as if groping
for support Two men rushed to her
side and then - with a long low
sigh - she collapsed in their arms
(pause)
I decided then I enjoyed being

haroldandmaudehomepagecomxhigginnsscreenplaytxt 60105
3612 haroldandmaudehomepagecomxhigginnsscreenplay txt
dead

Maude doesnt say anything for a moment Then she speaks
softly

MAUDE

Yes I understand A lot of people
enjoy being dead But they are not
dead really Theyre just backing
away from life

(with a twinkle)
Theyre players - but they sit on
the bench The game goes on before
them At any moment they can join
in

(she jumps up

and shouts)
Reach out Take a chance Get
hurt maybe But play as well as
you can

(she leads a

cheer before

the stands)
Go team go Give me an L
Give me an I Give me a V
Give me an E LIVE

(she sits down

by Harold quietly

composed)
Otherwise youll have nothing to
talk about in the locker room

HAROLD
(smiles)
I like you Maude

MAUDE
(smiles)
I like you Harold
(pause)
Come Ill teach you to waltz

Music comes in from nowhere Harold joins Maude and
though they both realize how ridiculous they look waltzing
in kimonos they begin to dance and thoroughly enjoy it

We go into a MONTAGE as they dance together similar to
the one Maude danced alone They dance on the beach the
forest the fields the hills and end up back in her
apartment for the courtly finale

HAROLD

With gusto he plunges the knife into his belly He drops
to his knees bleeding profusely He continues the upper-
cut and sidecut gouging with appropriate Oriental screams

He stops and tumbles forward - lifeless
Sunshine stands in awe She slowly bends down
SUNSHINE

Oh that was marvelous Harold

(continuing)
Yea noise Then Ill be brief

She takes stunned Harolds dagger pressing the blade
back and forth in the handle to see how it operates

SUNSHINE
(continuing)
Oh happy dagger This is
thy sheath

She stabs herself between the breasts

SUNSHINE
(continuing)
There rest--

She staggers to the couch clutching the dagger

SUNSHINE
(continuing)
- and let me die

She collapses and expires

Harold gets up He has never seen anything like it
He wanders around the couch as if he was looking at
an idiot

Mrs Chasen enters with a tray full of drinks sees

Sunshine dead on the couch and drops them all with

a loud crash She looks over at a bewildered Harold
Summing up the situation she flings out an accusing

say this country has been too harsh

wars ever since have been a national
disgrace Hell look at history
The two best wars this country has
fought were against the Jerries

other side of the fence where they
belong and lets get back to the
kind of enemy worth killing and the
kind of war this whole country can
support

Maude runs out on the edge of the dam right past a

sign saying Danger - No Trespassing The water is
churning below making a deafening racket Harold follows
her The General runs after him Maude beats off

Harold with her umbrella The General joins the fray

and most of the blows fall on him Much ad-libbing
Despite only having one arm the General manages to

pull the sign away from Harold and throw it over the

dam It is quickly churned up by the treacherous

water Harold is holding Maudes umbrella Maude is
gamely trying to hold on to it and at the same time keep
hold of the shrunken head The General joins the tussle
for the umbrella Furious ad libs as they scuffle

The General finally wrenches it free A pause Harold
looks at Maudes position standing next to the General
He reaches over and pulls the Generals lanyard The
empty sleeve comes flying up for a salute knocking Maude
over the dam and into almost certain death amid the
rushing water below

A long pause The two look down but there is no sign
of Maude

The General his empty sleeve still at salute looks
around him He cant believe it Such a tragedy
Over nothing It all happened so fast How did it
ever get so out of control He looks over to Harold
for some answers Harold looks up

HAROLD
I lost my head

down the beach or across the
sea in China is looking at them
too Someone we dont know
and most likely will never see
- that someone is breathing
along with us And the star-
gazers of the past - from
peasant to princes - and the
star-gazers of the future -
all of us breathing and looking
up there We are alone - but
look at the stars and never
feel lonely

representations of people I
dearly loved yet they knew
these people were gradually
fading from me and that in
time all I would have left would
be vague feelings - but sharp
photographs So I tossed them
out My memory fades I know
But I prefer pictures made by
me with feeling and not by
Kodak with silver nitrate

HAROLD
Ill never forget you Maude
(pause)
But I would like a photo of
you
She laughs

Well let me see

She goes to the end of the bed and from beneath it

out an old box She opens it and looks about

HAROLD

Youve never cried before I
never thought you would I
thought despite anything you
could always be happy

MAUDE
Oh Harold You are so young

She strokes his hair The tears continue to fall

MAUDE
(continuing)
What have they taught you
Yes I cry I cry for you
I cry for this
(the visa)
I cry at beauty - a first snow
a rose a sunset

As she talks through her tears Harold is very moved
He takes her hand

MAUDE
(continuing)
I cry when a man tortures his
brother when he repents and
begs forgiveness when
forgiveness is refused and

when it is granted To cry is
to laugh To laugh is to cry
a uniquely human trait
And the main thing in life my
dear Harold is not to be
afraid to be human

They sit facing each other on the end of the bed We
see from the bed the fire glowing behind them Harold
brushes the tears from her eyes He leans forward and
kisses her lightly on the lips

kiss again break and fall back onto the bed and OUT

Harold your mother has spoken to me
about your marriage plan and though
normally I have nothing against
marriage I dont think this is eh
quite normal Now I dont want to
remind you of the unpleasant incident
that occurred the other day I think
it is best if we consider that
forgotten But I do think that it
would be wisest for you not to leave
the house or indulge in any kind of
activity that would be newsworthy
This marriage would attract attention
and frankly Harold I dont think you
need a wife You need a nurse

INT PSYCHIATRISTS OFFICE - DAY

The psychiatrist sits at his desk A picture of Sigmund
Freud is over his right shoulder He too seems to be
addressing the nation

PSYCHIATRIST
Theres no doubt Harold this
impending marriage adds another
chapter to an already fascinating
case But let us examine it and
I think youll realize there is a
simple Freudian explanation for
your romantic attachment to this
older woman It is known as the
Oedipus Complex a very common
neurosis particularly in this
society whereby the male child
subconsciously wishes to sleep
with his mother

Of course what puzzles me

Harold is that you want to
sleep with your grandmother

PRIEST

(very reasoned and slow)
Now Harold the Church has
nothing against the union of
the old and the young Each
age has its own beauty But a
marital union is concerned with
the conjugal rights And the
procreation of children I
would be remiss in my duties if
I did not tell you that the
idea of --

(he swallows)
- intercourse - the fact of
your young firm --

(growing

disturbed)
-- body commingling with the
withered flesh sagging breasts
and flabby buttocks - makes me --

(falls apart)
- want to vomit

to a rather simpleminded STUDENT NURSE

A GANGLING INTERN with horn-rimmed glasses looks on

Maude enters on the gurney The ambulance men move
off to the back counter and talk as they fill out their
forms

Harold is almost hysterical

Maude on the other hand is very calm She holds the
daisy and hums to herself Maudes Song

(NOTE This scene goes very fast with much of the
dialogue dovetailed and ad libs overlapping in the
background )

Harold is crying He walks down the hospital corridor

HIS POV - THE MATERNITY WARD

He passes the maternity ward Laughing parents pointing
at screaming infants Their noise overrides the
laughing baby and joins the rising intensity of the
MUSIC

BACK TO HAROLD

Harold walks faster His face is drawn with pain and tears

We TRACK before him He looks left and sees

A WOMAN

in a room delirious with pain

A MAN

in disheveled pajamas walks from his room like a
bewildered child dribbling food down his front

BACK TO HAROLD

He keeps walking fast He looks right and sees

A FAMILY GROUP

who have just been told of a death They cry in each
others arms

A TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY confused looks up at them and

Harolds mini hearse swerves around the corner at high
speed Dust rises and tires screech

On the TRACK the crying has stopped but the MUSIC is
building to a new climax

Harold ignoring the tears rolling down his cheeks

grips the wheel hard and drives like a man with an
unrelenting purpose

EXT THE ROCKS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CLIFF

We see them from the car window

ANGLE - THE CAR

dangerously close to the edge

CLOSEUP - HAROLD

He seems possessed

LOW ANGLE SHOT FROM THE FRONT BUMPER OF THE CAR

The road rushes past as we maneuver around treacherous
curves

EXT THE ROCKS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CLIFF

He makes a sudden right-hand turn and drives out on a

promontory toward the sea

LOW ANGLE SHOT FROM THE FRONT BUMPER OF THE CAR

We see dirt and grass race beneath us -

ANOTHER ANGLE

We reach the edge of the cliff - we plunge off into
space

EXT THE PROMONTORY - EXTREME LONG SHOT - DAY

The little hearse falls from the cliff crashing at the
bottom and bursting into flame

EXT ON TOP OF THE CLIFF - DAY

We look down at the burning vehicle We HOLD and watch
it burn

LONG SHOT

Gradually the fire dies down

Suddenly we hear the fumbled pluckings of Maudes Song
on a banjo It stops

PANNING SHOT

We PAN up left and there is Harold as large as life
He takes a look over the cliff

HIS POV

His hearse is still quietly burning

BACK TO HAROLD

He wipes his nose with the back of his hand and tries
again on the banjo

He barely gets the melody started before he is lost
Summoning up all his concentration he tries again and
this time he manages to get the fingering right He
continues playing and turns away from the edge

He started slow but now he is gradually beginning to
play the song in its original upbeat tempo He gets
better and better at it The song is very catching
and Harolds tear-stained face registers what could
be a smile He walks by the CAMERA and we turn with
him and HOLD

A full orchestra joins in the playing and we watch
Harold amble down the road strumming along until he

is only a small figure in the distance

FADE OUT
