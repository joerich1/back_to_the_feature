RIVER ROAD
by

Andrew Niccol
A RIVER

at night An eerie yellow light dances off gently flowing
water However tilting up we discover that it is more than
ariver It is a border

The gentle bed in the river is flanked on both banks by not
so-gentle defenses Metal fences topped with barbed-wire
stretch as far as the eye can see Sentry-towers stand
facing each other silhouetted against the sky The golden
glow on the river is created by floodlights that keep the
border continually illuminated a buoy anchored to the
center of the channel carries the flags of the respective
countries on either bank

We focus on a TREE TRUNK floating innocently over the river
EXT RIVER LEVEE - NIGHT

On a levee on the right bank beyond the barbed-wire fences
several RESIDENTS play a board game outside the row of box
like houses where they live There is a tension in the night

air

We focus on the man YAEGER middle-aged (as we will learn
an achievement in itself) afflicted with a permanent injury

to his right leg He glances out at the border trying not

to appear too interested in the tree trunks progress
A young woman VERA steals a glance at the tree trunk
between wafting sheets on a clothes line attaches to the
fence

EXT GUARD TOWER - NIGHT

We view the floating TREE TRUNK over the shoulder of a BORDER
GUARD manning a machine-gun post in a near bank tower

The guard looks to his SUPERIOR standing with his back to
us A barely perceptible nod from the commanding officer
The guard fires indiscriminately into the tree trunk

Bullets rip into the bark However it is not sap that seeps
from the tree but blood -- a bloom of blood dyes the river
red

EXT RIVER LEVEE - NIGHT

YAEGER and the other RESIDENTS watch as the trunk sinks from
view VERA catches her eight-year-old son HECTOR gazing at
the ill-fated crossing attempt and chases him back to the

house with a sharp look

EMMETT
(aside to Yaeger)
Tree What was he thinking

YAEGER
Its not the tree its the
species I told Conrad that type
of tree doesnt grow by the river

The OTHERS nod sagely in agreement One of the men VAN
begins a painting to commemorate the event

VERA changes the sign on her run-down boarding house from NO
VACANCY to VACANCY

FADE TO BLACK SCREEN ACCOMPANIED BY SINGING SOUND
EXT DISTRICT BORDER - DAY
A desolate plain swept by the wind We discover the source
of the high-pitched sound It is a fence of razor wire
vibrating in the breeze The fence dissects the plain --
minefields planted on either side of the fence We track
along the fenceline until we come upon a border station
controlling travel between two districts of the same country
-- the 33rd and 34th

The landscape is reminiscent of a country in South-West
Europe or perhaps South-East Europe Then again it could be
somewhere in the Americas The time period is also
uncertain Ten years in the future Ten years in the past
With the worlds nations in such different stages of
development it could be present day

LABORERS stand in line carrying their meager belonging The

line leads to a desk set up outdoors DISTRICT GUARDS check
the laborers documents -- INTERNAL PASSPORT emblazoned on
the cover As they wait in line a MILITARY DOCTOR gives the
men a cursory physical check

A man steps up to the desk MILAR (pronounced My-lar) KLINE
is a man of indeterminate age his gaunt face making him

appear older than his years His hair closely cropped in the
styleless fashion of a prisoner or a soldier He smiles

broadly in an attempt to disguise his unease Milar is so

painfully thin that he is scarcely recognizable as the robust

youth in the ID photo

DISTRICT GUARD
(suspiciously regarding
the photo)
This you

MILAR
Was a year ago Mightve dropped a
couple of pounds
(trying to appear
nonchalant)
Cant be too rich or too thin
The Guard looks to the Military Doctor who shrugs The Guard
also finally shrugs and stamps Milars passport Milar joins
the approved laborers on a waiting bus

INT BUS - DAY

MILAR eagerly clambers over another passenger CASTRO to get
to a window seat Castro is a burly man sweating profusely

MILAR
(conspiratorial)
That was a piece of pie

CASTRO
Theyre desperate Sickness

MILAR
Were not staying long anyhow
right

Castro half-smiles noncommittal A GUARD machine gun slung
over his shoulder stands in front of the bus to keep an eye

on the LABORERS Milar opens the window and begins to
whistle cheerfully as the bus departs

EXT DISTRICT BORDER - DAY

The bus crosses the border line past a sign that reads You

Are Now Entering The 33rd District - West Borderlands They
pass several isolated oil derricks but Milar is gazing at the

road ahead In the distance the silhouette of row upon row

of factories and the outskirts of a town Milar

enthusiastically elbows the uncomfortable-looking Castro in

the ribs

INT EXT BUS INDUSTRIAL PARK - DAY

MILAR sits up in his seat as the bus enters the TOWNSHIP
studying every detail of the frontier town and its defenses
Numerous billboards advertise the parks products The bus
finally pulls to a stop outside a gate A sign reads
Welcome
to
BORDERLANDS

INDUSTRIAL PARK 88

Milar exits the bus with the other LABORERS carrying their
belongings the GUARD barking directions

GUARD
-- Find a room Company hostels
meals included Boarding houses
take your chances Shift begins
six sharp

The factory the last in the row backs onto the river

protected by a levee and fenced off by military

fortifications Adjacent to the factory are the company

hostels -- dormitories consisting of freight containers

converted into dwellings While the other LABORERS head for
the container rooms Milar begins to walk towards a

collection of makeshift houses and boarding houses along the
unimaginatively named River Road the last public
thoroughfare running parallel to the river

CASTRO
(to Milar nodding to the
containers)
This way

MILAR
(shaking his head)
River view

CASTRO
Sewer view

Against his better judgement CASTRO joins MILAR already
striding away down River Road

EXT RIVER ROAD - DAY
Satellite dishes pointing in the direction of the far bank

sit atop the roofs of the box-like houses along River Road

The RESIDENTS (clothes threadbare faces emaciated from years
of having to make do) go about their normal lives --

cooking fetching water tending gardens hanging washing

But life is not normal The houses on the river side of
River Road literally back onto the militarized border From
the defeated faces of the residents we sense the frontier

has taken a toll The properties are separated by rows of
small stones One house bears a protest sign faded over
time MATT 2239

A studious-looking man LEON stands at a trestle table
taking great care painting the flag of the neighboring
country on a piece of cloth

Two teenage sisters GLORIA and VALERIE dance to an
antiquated radio tuned to the poor reception of a station
across the border Several MEN drinking weak beer enjoy
the free show

One of the houses overlooking the river carries a sign --
TRAVEL BUREAU - Travel Tips Weekend Getaways Package
Tours

INT TRAVEL BUREAU YAEGERS HOUSE - DAY

Inside several tired travel posters adorn the walls a

couple of faded national flags sit atop a rickety desk
YAEGER is straightening a gallery of framed portraits on one
wall -- a makeshift wall of fame commemorating former
border crossers His assistant EMMETT dusts the portraits

EMMETT
-- Garbage thats the answer

YAEGER
-- Forget it Emmett

EMMETT
Its the perfect disguise
YAEGER
Its also what the guards use for
target practise

EMMETT
They dont have the ammunition for
all the garbage in the river

YAEGER
I said forget it

EMMETT
So negative

GATES appears at the door He nods through the window
towards the approaching MILAR and CASTRO No new arrival
escapes attention Yaeger scrutinizes the pair with a

practiced eye as they approach a boarding house at 33 River
Road

YAEGER
(referring to a notebook
Emmett holds)
Make a note of the thin one
Potential Wandering eyes And
where the eyes wander

EMMETT
(completing the mantra)
the feet follow

EXT BOARDING HOUSE - 33 RIVER ROAD - DAY

Two pieces of 2 x 4 standing on end pound around on the

dusty property that faces the fences the river and the far

bank beyond We tilt up the planks of wood until we discover

we have been looking at a pair of seven-foot high stilts At

the top of the homemade stilts is EIGHT-YEAR-OLD HECTOR in
threadbare clothing a tin can hanging around his neck on a

piece of string He is straining to catch a glimpse over the
forbidding fence on the other side of the river
MILAR hesitates and watches the boy -- we sense a kindred
spirit

MILAR
What can you see

HECTOR
(never averting his eyes
from the far bank)
Its beautiful

Milar smiles at the boys wishful thinking the extra height
affords Hector precious little extra view Suddenly the
shrill blast of a whistle sounds followed by a GUARD
appearing around the side of the house

GUARD
Delinquent

VERA the boys mother appears at the doorway cooking bowl
in hand

VERA
Hector get down from there

Hector tries to escape on his stilts but topples over one of

the stilts breaking The BORDER GUARD picks up a piece of
broken stilt to beat the boy Milar steps between Hector and
the Guard

MILAR
(to the guard ironically
referring to the frail

boy)
-- Major threat to border security

GUARD
And you are

MILAR
His guardian
Hector smiles at the suggestion

GUARD
Since when

MILAR
(staring down the guard)
Since you started beating on a boy

Something about Milars resolve intimidates the guard
Castro also takes a step forward The guard backs off

The commotion has attracted the attention of the LOCALS --
YAEGER a witness to the act of kindness He makes an aside
to EMMETT

YAEGER
Potential Just like I said

Vera takes Hector by the scruff of the neck and guides him
towards the main house

VERA
Get inside Hector One of these
days youre going to break your
neck
(to Milar and Castro)
Looking for a room

Milar flipping the VACANCY sign to NO VACANCY

MILAR
Something with a westerly aspect

Castro regards the eccentric collection of locals

CASTRO
(under his breath to
Milar)
What a freak show
VERA
(overhearing Castro)
Its your future if youre lucky
enough to have one

Vera escorts the newcomers to the bunk house detached from
the main house She stops at the first room Milar has his
eye on aroom closer to the fence

MILAR
Whats wrong with that room

VERA
Its not for rent

INT EXT BOARDING HOUSE - ROOM FOR RENT - DAY

VERA shows MILAR and CASTRO around the modest dwelling
HECTOR watches from the background A wood-fire stove for
cooking Netting covers the beds

VERA
-- Theres no rhyme or reason with
the virus One gets it the one
next to him doesnt If I were you
Id sleep under the netting No
proof it helps cant hurt Pay
for a whole month Ill give you a
better rate

CASTRO
Lets go week to week

MILAR
Just passing through

Vera nods resignedly

VERA
(glancing to a couple of
plastic containers)
Waters rationed One jug per
individual per day -- fetch it from
the pump Dont forget to boil it
Any questions

CASTRO
(feigned concern)
Please dont tell me you run this
place on your own Wheres the man
of the house

VERA
There isnt one And dont think
youre about to change that I
dont get involved with border
crossers
(matter-of-fact)

Seen one too many float past my
window

CASTRO
(irritated by the rebuff)
What makes you think were
interested in crossing

VERA

Well if youre here for the view
I hope you like it Because one
way or another youre going to find
out the borders closed

(to Milar as she departs)
By the way thanks for looking out
for my boy

MILAR
Right you are

CASTRO
(watching her exit)
One reason to stay on this side

Milar pretends not to care He picks up a plastic water jug
suspiciously reminiscent of a disused chemical container
MILAR
You coming

CASTRO
(collapsing on a bed)
Im beat

EXT FENCELINE PUMP - RIVER ROAD - DUSK

MILAR stands in line to fetch his allocation of water from

the pump located inside the guarded fence A weary BORDER
GUARD machine-gun resting on his lap keeps watch When he
has filled his container Milar strolls to the fence

He gazes across the meandering river that curves in an arc

from one end of River Road to the other He scrutinizes the
border defences on both banks Fences floodlights SENTRIES
in towers -- curiously the sentries pay closer attention to
activity inside their own country than outside it One GUARD
looks outwards TWO look in

Across the narrow river the far bank defenses mirror those of
the near bank The only difference is the addition of a
plastic curtain lining the far fence cutting off the view

of the neighboring country

The SENTRIES on the far bank never emerge from their towers
They are seen only as shapes shadows and silhouettes Once

in a while we see their point-of-view of the near bank

through the lenses of their binoculars

The last remaining tractor-trailer trucks are transporting
containers from the factories towards the heavily policed but
hopefully named World Bridge -- a bridge almost
exclusively devoted to trucks In the center of the bridge
the vehicles cross a gold metallic strip running the width of
the span and representing the dividing line between the two
nations Upon reaching the far bank the fully laden trucks
disappear through a high gate that offers no view of the
other side
Another MAN with a water jug XAVIER appears next to Milar

XAVIER
(gazing at the other side
of the river)
-- There it is Congratulations

Milar regards Xavier warily

XAVIER

You made it this far I can get
you the rest of the way

(conspiratorial)
As a matter-of-fact a door in the
fence opened up quite recently
For a small consideration Id be
happy to show you Care to take a
stroll along the river

MILAR
(weighing the offer
glancing to his water
container)
Only river I care about is the
piece Im carrying

XAVIER
(scrutinizing him to gauge
his seriousness)
You change your mind you let me
know

MILAR
Youll be the first

Xavier saunters away YAEGER also at the fenceline with
EMMETT and EVERS has observed the encounter He approaches
Milar

YAEGER referring to the departing figure of XAVIER already
approaching another NEWCOMER
YAEGER
How did you know

Milar glances to Xaviers shoe prints in the dust and then to
the shoe prints left by GUARDS on the border road beyond the
fence

MILAR
The shoes Same prints I see on
the other side of the fence

YAEGER
(nods impressed)
Border Patrol issue Xaviers
getting slack Local snitch
Around here it pays to know who
youre talking to

MILAR
Who am I talking to

YAEGER
Who says were talking

Yaeger produces a business card from his worn overalls --
RIVER ROAD TRAVEL BUREAU - Arlen Yaeger - CEO

YAEGER

(conspiratorial)
Names Yaeger Travel Bureau
CEO Only bona fide travel guide
in the district I provide
everything from group consultation
to private tuition and equipment
rental Results vary between
individuals Strictly cash in
advance

Milar smiles hands back the card and starts walking away
Yaeger follows his bad leg making it difficult to keep up

YAEGER
(following Milars gaze to

the maze of fences)
Not what you expected -- Didnt
think itd be so elaborate did
you

(glancing wistfully across

the river)
Wasnt always like this Shame you
didnt come here ten years ago
Used to be the fence wasnt even a
fence Just a single wire But
when the trade barriers came down
the people barriers went up

(glancing to the last

tractor-trailers heading

across the bridge)
Now unless youve got a barcode on
you somewhere I cant see youre
not getting across the river
Mr

MILAR
Kline Milar Kline

YAEGER

(conspiratorial)
Let me give you a piece of free
advice Milar Kline There are
only four ways across the border --
over under around and through
Everythings been tried -- most
everything fails Theoretically
it can be done But only through
me

Milar finally pauses to face him

MILAR
(dismissive)
Its a fence a river and a fence
How hard can it be
A BIRD flying over the fenceline in the direction of the far
bank takes their attention

The bird is suddenly shot out of the sky It startles Milar
The bird lands in the shallows of the river

MILAR regards the man who took the shot -- Border Commander
AUGUST S GIDEON standing in his guard tower A thoughtful
looking man

YAEGER
August S Gideon Border Chief
for the 33rd

MILAR
(trying to hide his
unease)
Doesnt even like birds migrating

YAEGER
Oh hes thorough Keeps a running
tally of his kills on the stock of
his rifle Try to cross you
generally get one

We see a cutaway to the stock of GIDEONs rifle as he hands

it to his stone-faced right-hand LIEUTENANT VALENTINE The
stock of the rifle is decorated with numerous cross shapes
indicating Gideons human victims

MILAR
Good to see a man who enjoys his
work

YAEGER

Hes why you need me

(reading his eyes)
I know what youre thinking Milar
Youre thinking if youre going to
end up facedown in the river
anyhow why pay me for the
privilege Well let me tell you
why You have as much chance of
crossing as you do of flying but

as least I paste feathers on your

arms With me your chances go from
none to slim

MILAR
I like my odds the way they are

Yaeger can take a hint He lets Milar walk on alone

YAEGER
(referring to the jug
Milar still carries)
Dont forget to boil that water

MILAR
(a smile)
Sure Dont want to get poisoned
before I get shot

Even Yaeger has to smile at the remark Emmett and Evers
approach

EMMETT
Is he on board

YAEGER
He will be

EXT OUTDOOR MARKET - DUSK
Milar stops at an outdoor market and buys a stack of books --

the books sold for kindling rather than reading A stove
rages nearby fueled by hardcovers

BOOKSELLER
Classics burn best -- its the gram
weight of paper

Milar departs up the hill
EXT BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT

MILAR returns to his bunk house pausing at the fenceline one
last time From the main house VERA watches him as she
draws the blinds

The floodlights are illuminating on both banks In addition
a classical music we have never heard before begins to play
from speakers on the far fence Several houses away LEON
the man seen earlier painting the flag sets it on fire His
futile protest is ignored by GUARDS and RESIDENTS alike
Milar refocuses his attention on the river

MATCH DISSOLVE TO
INT INDUSTRIAL PARK - FACTORY - DAY

Another river flows towards us a shimmering glistening
out-of-focus canal light dancing off it When the river
comes into sharp focus we discover that it is not liquid
after all but a moving conveyor belt laden with TV tubes

Naked 32 inch cathode-ray tubes like a row of inverted
champagne glasses bob along the conveyor belt WORKERS
adroitly add components to the TVs innards while OTHERS
complete the more mundane tasks covering the exposed anatomy
with a plastic case They are retro-style TVs

The camera pauses at one of the workers -- MILAR CASTRO
mans the adjacent station For a moment we watch Milar work
His hands move precisely as he fits the final rivets into the
television cases As he inspects the finished product we see

the reflection of his face in the dull lifeless screen -- he

is in a trance his mind far from the drudgery of the work

YAEGER and EMMETT approach on the pretext of doing
maintenance on the assembly line

YAEGER under his breath to Milar while toying with an
unhygienic medical mask around his neck

YAEGER
Theres fever in the air People
get desperate They figure if the
disease comes over the river
thats where theyll find the cure
Desperation is not the ideal frame
of mind for a successful crossing
You understand

MILAR
(continuing to work as he
talks)
I understand a mass break would be
bad for business You wouldnt
want someone leaving before youve
lightened their pockets

YAEGER
(face hardening)
You can run faster with lighter
pockets

EMMETT

(offended at Milars

insolence)
-- Mr Yaeger is trying to give
you the benefit of his experience
Trying to save your sorry ass --
God knows why Weve forgotten
more about border crossing than
youll ever know

MILAR
You know so much about crossing
why are you still here

The remark sounds a little too much like the truth
EMMETT
Something needs fixing here

Yaeger

Emmett suddenly cheap shots Milar a backhand with a wrench
across the face -- the blow taking Milar to the ground
Yaeger despite the brace he wears on his leg blocks Castro
from coming to Milars aid The assembly line stalls as the
TV tubes back up and an alarm sounds Emmett and Yaeger
hurry away Castro helps Milar back to his station The
assembly line restarts

CLOSE UP on a drop of blood as it splashes from Milars nose

onto the TV set on which he is working Foreman MALDANO and
an elegantly suited gentleman HELLER search for the cause

of delay in production

MALDANO
-- Well make up the short-fall
Mr Heller

CASTRO gazes at Heller so manicured and robust he could be
from another planet

CASTRO
(whispered to a nearby
worker)
Thats the foreigner

EVERS
Who else

HELLER
(noticing Milars
injuries)
What happened here

ALL EYES on the assembly line turn to Milar

MILAR
I fell -- lost my balance

HELLER
(wryly observing)
Must have lost it a couple of
times
MALDANO
Clean yourself up Kline Mr
Heller doesnt need you bleeding on
his merchandise

Maldano and Heller continue their rounds of the plant
EXT INDUSTRIAL PARK - FACTORY ENTRANCE PATH - DAY

MILAR bearing the scars of his attack emerges from the

factory with CASTRO and the other WORKERS at the end of their
shift They collect their wages -- stacks of bills thanks to

the borders rampant inflation

LEON
(inspecting his wage slip)
Whats this This deduction
Theres a deduction here

CLERK
(perfunctory)
Never met the quota

LEON
(protesting)
The units are up from last week

CLERK
So is the quota
(to the next man in line)
Next

The workers make their way down the path MILAR and CASTRO
keep their distance from YAEGER and his CRONIES

CASTRO
(glancing to Yaegers
group ensuring they are
out of earshot)
We dont need them Im meeting a
man about a new passport tonight
MILAR
You want me there

CASTRO
Hes shy

MILAR
Make sure you know who youre
talking to

CASTRO
Ill see you later

Castro departs Milar walks on past a map at the factory
entrance proclaiming YOU ARE HERE

EXT RIVER ROAD - DAY

MILAR walks back to the boarding house He observes several
RESIDENTS wearing handkerchiefs over their faces against the
oncoming virus One wears a life jacket for no apparent
reason

EXT BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

Arriving back at the house MILAR observes HECTOR flying a
kite high above the fenceline The kite has a cheap

instamatic camera attached to it Caught by a sudden gust of
wind the kite is sent crashing to the ground spilling the

ruined film

MILAR
Hey Hector
(nodding to the far fence)
Why you want to go over there so
bad

HECTOR
(a moments thought then
a shrug)
Ive seen here
Milar smiles

An ostentatious CAR incongruous on the dusty River Road
pulls up to the boarding house VERA loaded down with bags
from the market exits the rear seat she shares with HELLER

VERA
Thanks again Mr Heller
(looking up to the grey

sky)
Just beat the rain

HELLER
(glancing towards the
bridge)
Sure I cant take you a little
further Vera

VERA
(smiling at his suggestive
remark)
Another time thank you

Hector gazes at the automobile clearly taken with it

HECTOR
(to Milar)
I want a car just like that

Hector runs to help his mother Vera recognizes Milar by the
house Her face falls regretting accepting the ride

As Milar turns away into the bunk house it begins to rain
INT BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT

MILAR lies awake under the netting of his bed CASTRO
appears at his bedside

CASTRO
(insistent whisper)
Come on Were going
CASTRO almost drags Milar out of bed to the door Outside
the house the street and the entire bank is shrouded in
thick fog

CASTRO
Theres a blanket over the whole
entire river Down by the pump a
hole in the fence you could drive a
semi through

MILAR
What about the other bank

CASTRO
Theyve got to see you to shoot
you
(producing a deflated
inner tube)
Itll hold two Come on lets go

MILAR
Im thinking

CASTRO
About what Six I know have come
down with the fever You want to
be seven Well never have a
better chance than this

Milar looks out into the fog

EXT BOARDING HOUSE - MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT
VERA hears a door slam She opens the drapes of her bedroom
window just in time to see the figures of MILAR and CASTRO
disappear into the fog

INT EXT TRAVEL BUREAU - NIGHT

The members of the Travel Bureau - EMMETT OTTO EVERS LEON
-- are seated as if attending a travel lecture (although
there is little pretence of a legitimate travel agency)
YAEGER standing at an easel presides over the meeting

YAEGER
-- What qualities make up the ideal
border crosser Whats best --
fastidious planner or daring
opportunist

EVERS
(taking a stab at the
answer)
Neither

YAEGER
Both --

The meeting is interrupted by GATES appearing at the door
The mist that enters with him delivers the message YAEGER
goes to the door understanding the fogs significance

YAEGER
However the greatest gift an
escape artist must possess is

EMMETT
(completing the mantra)
knowing when not to escape

EXT RIVER - NIGHT

The mist on the river extends from fence to fence Only the
guard towers and the turrets of World Bridge are in clear
air The floodlights -- the Night Suns that normally
illuminate the river -- cannot pierce the cloud

EXT GUARD TOWER - NIGHT
BORDER GUARDS nervously finger their weapons and stare

impotently out into the gloom seeing nothing but listening
intently somehow sensing the presence of trespassers
EXT FENCELINE - NEAR THE PUMP - NIGHT

A hole has been cut in both fences the electric fence by-
passed by a jumper cable-like device Would be CROSSERS
emerge from the mist at the pre-arranged meeting point and
make for the water From a hidden advantage point XAVIER
makes a note of those crossing

Some crossers carry a flotation device -- usually homemade --
while others prepare to swim the river

Their anxiety is palpable never knowing if the next face
they encounter will be a Guard exposing the escape As MILAR
and CASTRO approach Xavier steps further back into the mist

EXT RIVER - NIGHT

We glimpse the CROSSERS through gaps in the mist as they
attempt to traverse the river by swimming or navigating their
way on every conceivable flotation aid -- inflatable

mattress lifebelt makeshift wooden raft ancient surfboard
-- incongruous in this setting a store display plastic soda
bottle even a faded old lifesize store cut-out of a

basketball player They paddle and swim as silently as
possible

We focus on MILAR and CASTRO Castro on the inner tube
Milar swimming quietly alongside

CASTRO
(anxious whisper
referring to the mist)
Its lifting Suns coming up

MILAR
Suns not up for hours

Visible through the mist is an orange glow

CASTRO
Yeah What is that
Castro paddles faster towards the light

MILAR
Castro Come back

Milar swims furiously after him
EXT CENTER OF THE RIVER - NIGHT

We focus on a fire in a metal drum It is one of many fires
lit in drums aboard a lone of patrol boats anchored in the
middle of the river The fires burn off the mist creating a
corridor of clear air

GIDEON LIEUTENANT VALENTINE and the BORDER GUARDS from
the

near bank stand in the boats machine-guns poised ready to

greet the flotilla of crossers

EXT RIVER - NIGHT

CASTRO still plunging on towards the false dawn is suddenly
caught up by MILAR

MILAR
(anxious whisper)
Come back

CASTRO
No Are you insane

Milar takes a vicious swing at Castro knocking him
senseless He begins to drag Castro back towards the bank

EXT CENTER OF THE RIVER - NIGHT

The other CROSSERS clear the curtain of fog only to come
face to face with the GUARDS in the boats and the muzzles of
their guns The exposed CROSSERS start to desperately paddle
back into the cover of the fog but too late GIDEON nods a
fatal nod
EXT FENCELINE - NIGHT

YAEGER and EMMETT have wandered down the fenceline to the
boarding house where VERA looks anxiously out into the fog
Suddenly automatic weapons open fire the flashes of the guns

the only light capable of penetrating the gloom The locals
shudder with each burst HECTOR runs out of the house in a
blanket and holds onto his mother -- he is suddenly eight

years old again

YAEGER
(defensive when the
gunfire quiets)
Dont look at me Vera I had
nothing to do with this They went
on their own

Vera lowers her head resigned Suddenly they hear the
sound of DOGS barking

EXT BOARDING HOUSE - 33 RIVER ROAD - NIGHT

MILAR drags CASTRO back up River Road towards the boarding
house unseen barking PATROL DOGS not far behind

INT BOARDING HOUSE - MILARS ROOM - NIGHT

The sodden MILAR and CASTRO collapse on the floor Castro
still feeling the effects of Milars blows

A sharp knock at the door Milar tentatively answers The
faces of YAEGER EMMETT VERA and HECTOR appear at the
doorway

YAEGER
(noting Milars drenched
clothes)
If that was a good idea dont you
think we would have tried it by
now

EMMETT
Least you had the sense to come
back

MILAR
(still smarting from the
factory beating)
You come to tell me that What do
you care

VERA
(snapping back)
Dont want you bleeding in the
river Some of us have to drink
that water

Her overly defensive remark betrays her true concern The
bark of approaching PATROL DOGS comes to her rescue Vera
tosses Milar fresh clothes

YAEGER
Get the smell of the river off you
-- before the guards get here

EXT FENCELINE - NEAR PUMP - MORNING

The last stubborn wisps of fog cling to the river The mist

clears to reveal BODIES floating facedown in the water
GUARDS with fish hooks haul the bodies to the bank A solemn
CROWD has gathered behind the fenceline

CHIEF GIDEON on horseback and his LIEUTENANT approach
They inspect the repaired hole in the fence Gideon soaks up

the hatred of the onlookers YAEGER EMMETT LEON EVERS and
some of the other RESIDENTS of River Road cover their noses

and mouths -- perhaps against the smell of death more likely

against the virus outbreak MILAR is also amongst the

onlookers

LEON
(looking directly at
Gideon)
I know theres no God but I pray
theres a hell

MILAR
(under his breath
referring to Gideon)
Has he forgotten whose side of the
river hes standing on

YAEGER
Dont worry whose side hes on A
bullet in the back of the head or
the front still gives you one hell
of a headache

EMMETT
(a groundless optimism)
I hear somebody made it Hoffman

OTTO
Shut up Emmett

A horn from the factory signals the start of the shift The
onlookers start to drift away towards the factory

EXT RIVER ROAD - DAY

A VICTIM of the virus drenched in perspiration is being
ferried towards the town center on a rusted gurney -- but no
ambulance is in sight MILAR stops in at the boarding house
on his way to the factory

INT BOARDING HOUSE - MILARS ROOM - DAY
MILAR calls out to Castro as he enters

MILAR
You can thank me anytime you want --
they never even got to the middle
CASTRO is lying on the bed where Milar left him

MILAR
Come on get out of there -- didnt
hit you that hard

MILARs voice trails away as he sees the sight that confronts
him Despite being bathed in perspiration Castro shivers
uncontrollably He is clearly suffering from fever rather
than the effects of any concussion

MILAR
Oh God

EXT BOARDING HOUSE - MILARS ROOM - DAY

MILAR emerges from the house with CASTRO in his arms wrapped
ina blanket VERA is outside doing the washing YAEGER
EMMETT and EVERS are making their way to the factory They

all stop in their tracks when they see Castro Even HECTOR

sitting on the doorstep fashioning a slingshot freezes

VERA
(finally breaking the
silence)
You can try the clinic but

MILAR
(concerned by their
reaction)
What

YAEGER
The virus comes over the river not
the cure Any vaccine on this bank
goes to Gideons horse before we
see it

EMMETT
I hate that horse

EVERS
Nothing to do but wait for the
virus to die itself
MILAR
I have to do something
(a dawning realization)
I took away his chance

YAEGER
He had no chance

EMMETT
(confused)
You saved him

Milar shakes his head

YAEGER
It was hopeless No one made it

MILAR
Hopeless or not I had no right

Milar carries Castro down River Road towards the main
township The locals watch him go -- they have clearly never
seen anyone like Milar before

EXT INFIRMARY - DAY

MILAR carries the delirious CASTRO to a dilapidated
infirmary

The infirmary is being policed by a CONSTABLE Other VICTIMS
of the virus some walking some carried on makeshift

stretchers are also trying to gain admittance The MEDICS
checking the patients wear surgical masks -- often the masks

are so unsanitary they look as if they would give the wearer

a disease of their own

A MEDIC makes a cursory examination of CASTRO

MILAR
I got to get him in

MEDIC
Nothing we can do Out of serum
Take him across the street

Across the street a building with a sign above the
entranceway -- MORGUE and CREMATORIUM

MILAR
(incredulous)
Hes not dead

A PATIENT in a similar condition still alive but barely is
ferried on a gurney from the infirmary across the street to
the morgue A row of simple wooden coffins sit outside
awaiting occupants

MEDIC
No sense making two trips

The medic moves on MILAR looks around unsure what to do
next

The decision is taken out of his hands When he looks back
to CASTROs ashen face it is suddenly very still

MILAR
(shaking Castro
concermed)
Castro -- Castro --
Castro has gone
DISSOLVE TO

EXT CREMATORIUM - DUSK
MILAR sits beside CASTROs simple box coffin outside the
CREMATORIUM where a row of other simple wooden coffins await
cremation He looks to the wind kicking up the dust

He waves to a battered taxi

CREMATORIUM OFFICIAL
(registering Castros box)
Where are you taking him

MILAR
(glancing to the border)
Over the river

The official looks startled
EXT WASTE DISPOSAL PLANT - DUSK

A Waste Disposal Plant adjacent to the factories stands on
the backs onto the border fence at the riverbank The taxi
pulls up outside the plant MILAR in the front seat CASTRO
in the back -- coffin sticking out of the rear door secured
with rope Milar exits the taxi We follow his gaze up to

the plants idle chimney A weathervane indicates the
direction of the wind towards the far bank

INT WASTE DISPOSAL PLANT - DUSK

We focus on an unlit furnace The SUPERVISOR and his WORKERS
are playing a board game MILAR enters

MILAR
I need the furnace

SUPERVISOR
-- Dont operate when the wind
blows west

MILAR
(placing his wages in
front of the Super)
Wind just changed

The Supervisor looks at Milar for the first time and then to
the taxi with CASTROs coffin protruding from the rear door

EXT WASTE DISPOSAL PLANT - NIGHT

White smoke billows from the chimney of the furnace The
wind catches it and blows it towards the river
EXT GIDEONS GUARD TOWER - NIGHT

The plume of smoke from the furnace drifts across the night
sky over the river and towards the far bank CHIEF GIDEON
standing in his tower gazes up at the smoke He shoots a
look to VALENTINE who holds an unanswered telephone

INT WASTE DISPOSAL PLANT - FURNACE ROOM - NIGHT

Flames roar in the furnace CASTROs empty coffin propped
against the wall The SUPERVISOR mops his brow However we
suspect his perspiration has less to do with the heat of the

furnace and more to do with the telephone that rings in front

of him Milar puts on Castros shoes

EXT RIVER - FENCELINE - NIGHT

MILAR stands alone at the fenceline and watches the plume of
smoke drift across the border

EXT FAR BANK - NIGHT

We focus on blades of grass that grow on the far bank The
grass becomes speckled with ash We tilt up to a sign that
reads YOU ARE NOW ENTERING THE REPUBLIC OF EA Speckle

S
of CASTROs ashes alight upon the sign
EXT RIVER ROAD - NIGHT

From outside their houses YAEGER EMMETT VERA and HECTOR
also observe the smoke in the distance Yaeger smiles a
bittersweet smile

YAEGER
Havent seen something that
beautiful in a while

VERA
(under her breath)
Or that stupid

EMMETT
-- Might as well have tattooed a
target on himself

EXT GIDEONS GUARD TOWER - NIGHT

GIDEON observes the trail of smoke from the chimney until it
drifts to nothing

EXT BOARDING HOUSE - MILARS ROOM - DAY

MILAR idly tills the earth of a sad little vegetable garden
outside his rented room He picks a wild flower He smells
its scent On the border road a man sitting on a horse is
watching him -- GIDEON

MILAR sensing GIDEONs presence he speaks to the Border
Chief without looking up

MILAR
Weeding Sir Not tunneling

Gideon dismounts and approaches the fence -- his everpresent
rifle on his shoulder The two men talk from opposite sides
of the fence

GIDEON
(good-natured)
Did I suggest otherwise
(referring to the flower
in Milars hand)
Its a flower from the other side
of the river

MILAR
(glancing to the far bank)
How do you suppose they get here
On the wind some clumsy bird drops
a seed
Gideon reaches through the fence for the flower Milar
passes it to him Gideon places it in his own lapel

GIDEON
T like it I like the scent

MILAR
(gesturing to the far
bank)
Its their flower their emblem
Its on their flag

GIDEON
You know a lot about it

MILAR
Know your enemy

GIDEON
Enemy

(glancing to the far bank)
They are our partners in trade A
border doesnt just separate you
know it also joins

MILAR
That razor wire does give me a
feeling of togetherness

GIDEON

(ignoring the sarcastic

remark)
Im Gideon Border Chief for the
33rd Milar isnt it

(meeting his gaze)
I missed you the other night Some
say you turned back others say you
never left

Milar doesnt reply
GIDEON
A man who stays in his cell when
the jail doors open thats a man
to watch Perhaps a patriot --

MILAR
-- Or a fool

GIDEON

Either way I congratulate you on
your decision I hope you will
come to share a respect for the
border

(getting to the reason for

his visit)
I have a report that your friend
died of the fever Where are his
ashes

MILAR
(pause)
You know how it is with ashes Mr
Gideon -- they get scattered

GIDEON
(smile)
Getting a dead man over is one
thing Milar I believe youll
find it more of a challenge with a
live one

GIDEON rides away MILAR watches him depart with barely
disguised contempt Milar glances back towards the
properties along River Road where the LOCALS have been
looking on With Gideon a safe distance away the travel
group led as always by Yaeger approaches

EMMETT
(sneering)
-- Still wondering why were still
here

EVERS
We tried to warn you --

YAEGER
-- The borders closed

MILAR
(staring across the river)
What border

They regard him confused

MILAR
I dont recognize this border or
any border God never put a border
on his creation

YAEGER
No but he did put Gideon on it

The group grins nervously

EVERS
That wasnt a social call you
know

MILAR
(unfazed)
Gideons nothing Puts his pants
on one leg at a time

EMMETT
Loads his gun one bullet at a time

Again they smirk

MILAR
I tell you hes nothing

YAEGER
He stopped you

MILAR
Im not stopped merely delayed

Milar strides back to his bunk house VERA overhearing has
to smile at the remark

INT INDUSTRIAL PARK - FACTORY - DAY

MILAR has returned to the production line CASTROs work
station has already been assigned to anew WORKER Milar

sizes up the television case he is assembling We watch him

touch his thumb to his forearm -- he is double-jointed

YAEGER and EMMETT pass on the pretext of doing maintenance

YAEGER
-- Were meeting tonight Ill
waive the registration fee

EMMETT
(under his breath)
You will

MILAR
Thanks but I think Ill go it
alone

YAEGER
Think about it

MALDANO appears on the factory floor making the rounds
Yaeger and the others hurry away Milar goes back to sizing
up the TV case

EXT BOARDING HOUSE - MILARS ROOM - DUSK
MILAR sits outside his bunk house gazing along the houses on
River Road Some distance away LEON sets fire to his ritual
flag

VERA bringing in her laundry follows Milars gaze

VERA
Youre not from here You dont
know what it does Bad enough
youre born in the wrong country
when youre born this close

(a rueful smile)
We call it the curse of River Road
Some get over it

Unfortunately the flag catches LEONs sleeve on fire causing
him to squeal and roll around on the ground His WIFE beats
him with a blanket we sense as an excuse to beat him as much

as to extinguish the fire

WIFE
Idiot Leon

LEON
Get off me woman

Leon dusts himself off

VERA
most dont

Milar and Vera cant help smiling at Leons inopportune
timing Milar gets up to help Vera fold the sheets

VERA

(resisting his help)
I can manage

MILAR
I know

Vera gives in Milars gesture doesnt go unnoticed by

HECTOR nearby toying with the tin can he always wears

around his neck

VERA
(making conversation as
they work)
-- What were you thinking when you
came here
MILAR
You dont know what I left The
worst thing that can happen here
would be an average day where I
come from

Vera takes his hand and finds a blister on his palm

VERA
I know you never worked on an
assembly line before What did you
used to do

He withdraws his hand -- slower than necessary

MILAR
Worked for a foreign computer
company

(eyeing the far bank)

Sent the work over the computer
They hired me on the computer paid
me on the computer -- thats how
they fired me

VERA
(gently teasing)
They find someone better

MILAR

Cheaper

(reflective)
For a long time I told myself I was
going to stick it out -- talked
myself into believing things would
get better the world would come to
me -- but after that I stopped
believing

VERA
So now the far bank is worth
risking your neck
MILAR

You die going you die staying
Fevers still in the air This
strain doesnt get you the next
one will Im not waiting for
another act of God Im going to
pick my own time

(continuing work)
Anyway its easy for you to say

VERA
(defensive)
Why

MILAR

(careful about broaching

the subject)
Youre the only one here who can
cross that river without dodging a
bullet I see how the foreigner
looks at you You could go with
him any time you want

VERA

(offended by the

suggestion)
Maybe I will

(looking along the row of

properties)
And maybe Ill stay right here
Not all of us have to go Id be
leaving everyone I care about Is
it really worth that

MILAR
(glancing across the
border answering simply)
Yes Yes it is

Vera picks up the folded laundry
VERA
Thank you

His attention is taken by several local MEN making their way
towards the Travel Bureau

VERA
(as she enters the house)
Are you going to the meeting

MILAR
I dont know
(calling out to Hector)
What do you think Hector Should
I go

HECTOR
(shrug)
They know a hundred ways not to
cross You might learn something

INT TRAVEL BUREAU YAEGERS HOUSE - NIGHT

The MEMBERS of the Travel Bureau pay a cover charge to

treasurer EMMETT as they enter -- VISITOR 360- MEMBERS 180-
MILAR enters paying his visitors fee YAEGERs face

brightens He goes to greet him

YAEGER
Youre making the right decision --

MILAR
-- Ill come to the meetings but I
dont want to join

YAEGER
Its cheaper to join

MILAR
Dont get the idea Im one of you
Im not from here Im going but --
YAEGER

-- I know I know youre going
alone

(shrug)
Of course you can attend on a
limited pay-as-you-go basis but
you miss out on the benefits of
full membership -- you do realize
that --

However Milar is already inspecting the room Yaeger
follows

MILAR
(referring to the meeting)
If Gideon lets this go on he cant
think much of your chances

YAEGER
Its the doing that illegal not
the talking

EVERS
(overhearing correcting
Yaeger)
Technically the talking is illegal
too

Yaeger shoots a look at Evers Milar idly examines the
Wall-of-Fame commemorating past border-crossers

MILAR
(glancing to the
portraits)
Any proof any of these made it

YAEGER
They can hardly drop you a
postcard
(referring to a portrait
of a psychotic-looking
man)
Anyway Vale Iverson definitely
made it Hijacked a patrol boat
(ushering Milar to a
chair)
Have a seat up here by me Milar
(getting the groups
attention)
For the benefit of our newcomer I
thought Id present a broad strokes
outline
(ooking to Milar)
As I believe I mentioned there are
only four ways to cross the border
-- under over around and through

The MEMBERS nod sagely in agreement

YAEGER
Under -- youre basically digging
your own grave Tunneling being
especially treacherous in alluvial
soil

EXT FENCELINE - DAY - SOMETIME EARLIER
A view of the fenceline that bars access to the river

YAEGER (VO)
Sometimes the ground betrays your
whereabouts

The ground beneath the fence suddenly subsides slightly

causing the fence to sag immediately arousing suspicion of a

patrolling GUARD He starts blowing his shrill whistle

EXT FENCELINE - NIGHT - SOMETIME EARLIER

A GUARD warms his fingers in the cold night air
YAEGER (VO)

Sometimes your perspiration gives
you away
The guards attention is taken by a plume of condensation
coming from a wormhole in the ground The guard stabs at the
soil with his bayonet The bayonet emerges with blood on its

tip
EXT TUNNEL RIVERS EDGE - DAY - SOMETIME EARLIER

From a black screen a pinhole of light appears Gradually

the hole becomes larger until we have an unobstructed view of
the river We are actually looking over the shoulder of a
TUNNELER wearing a makeshift miners helmet

Y AEGER (VO)
On occasion Gideon discovers a
tunnel and lets the man continue
digging for months thinking he
hasnt been detected

The tunnelers delight at seeing the river before him quickly
evaporates as he spies several cigarette butts on the ground
The cigarettes have come from a group of GUARDS sitting on
the bank behind him anticipating his appearance

YAEGER (VO)
It makes the subsequent arrest that
much more demoralizing

EXT TRAVEL BUREAU - DAY
We return to the present

YAEGER
But of course the major
disadvantage with tunneling is it
only gets you to the river --
doesnt get you across it
(switching topics eyes
forward)
As for passage over the border
Over is pretty much well
over We had one aviator a while
back Camille Azaria Made a
balloon out of off-cuts from the
Fashion Park

EXT FENCELINE RIVER - DAY - SOMETIME EARLIER

We follow a GUARDs gaze up to a homemade balloon high up in
the sky with a sole occupant -- CAMILLE The balloons
progress is not forward but strictly upwards

YAEGER (VO)
Not enough ballast unfortunately --
just kept going up

The balloon becomes even smaller in the sky
INT TRAVEL BUREAU - NIGHT
We return to the present

EVERS
(to Milar)
Camille flew directly to heaven

Despite himself Milar smiles sympathetically Yaeger
continues

YAEGER
Circumventing the fence -- going
around -- first requires reaching
the most accessible end of the
river downstream

GATES
(nodding vigorously in
agreement)
Go with the flow Go with the
flow

YAEGER
Four district fences between here
and the rivermouth four sets of
patrols If the goons dont kill
you on the way there a crossing
almost certainly would

EXT RIVER MOUTH - DAY - SOMETIME EARLIER

We track along the fences on the two riverbanks -- bristling
with sentry towers and gun positions

YAEGER (VO)
Most heavily fortified section of
the border Rumor is even the
tide has to get permission to turn

The river widens and suddenly opens into the sea Although
the river ends the two fences continue -- over the beach and
another hundred yards or so into the very ocean Beyond
that in the open sea patrol boats guard the theoretical
border

YAEGER (VO)
According to all reliable records
no successful open-sea crossing
from international waters has been
achieved to date

INT TRAVEL BUREAU YAEGERS HOUSE - NIGHT
We return to the meeting EMMETT interjects

EMMETT
What about Lennox

YAEGER
(sighs)
Lennox Suliman Hes fish food

The MEMBERS talk over one another the meeting degenerating

EMMETT
-- Lennox made it
GATES
-- He never made it

OTTO
-- You know what happened to
Lennox Theres no point going
over it again

EMMETT
-- It was the right idea

YAEGER
-- Idea It was a fantasy

EXT RIVER MOUTH - DAY - SOMETIME EARLIER

We focus on a small battered dinghy steered by a man
standing in the boat -- the wild-eyed LENNOX He has set out
from the beach along the imaginary border line that extends
beyond the fence He is shadowed all the while by a PATROL
BOAT

LENNOX
(calling out to the patrol
boat)
If the water would just keep still
you could paint a line here

YAEGER (VO)
Lennoxs problem was he forgot
about the water on the inside of
his boat

Sure enough Lennox is standing in ankle-deep water The
GUARD in the patrol boat holds its position as Lennox paddles
away sinking lower and lower into the water as he crosses

the horizon

INT TRAVEL BUREAU - NIGHT

We return to the meeting
EMMETT
(stubbornly clinging to
his position)
Lennox made it

EVERS
-- Over the horizon Over the
horizon doesnt mean --

YAEGER

-- Whether Lennox made it or not
he couldnt do it today -- not
under present conditions When
Lennox walked to the beach
internal security was virtually
non-existent Now Gideon keeps
the district fence as tight as the
border Hes planting minefields
along some stretches Mines in
your own country -- if you can
believe that The point is you
cant navigate what you cant
reach

(returning to his prepared

text)
Which leaves passage across the
river -- and through the far fence
These fall into two major subsets --
bridge and water attempts

YAEGER
Thats our specialty I could give
you examples but right now with
Gideon on full alert --

EMMETT
(nodding)
-- Maximum alert

YAEGER
-- The borders effectively closed
So Im recommending a wait-and-see
policy

EVERS
Wait-and-see Good move Yaeger
(to Simmons the old man
seated beside him)
This is why we pay the guy

Nods of approval Only Milar surprised by their lack of
action is visibly restless Yaeger notices

YAEGER
You following all this

MILAR
All what Youre not doing
anything

YAEGER
Not doing anything right now
Were in a holding pattern
(condescending)
Impatience is the enemy of a
successful crossing Often you
only get one shot at this
Timings got to be right
(painful memory)
I stopped a bullet a while back
rushing the gate like a damn fool
Could be career-ending

MILAR
(interest piqued)
How far did you get

YAEGER
(referring to the brace on
his leg)
I dont like to talk about it Im
waiting for parts
(returning to his theme)
The point is a lot more goes into
these things than you might
imagine I call it the three
Ps Planning preparation and
ef
(temporarily forgetting

the third P)

planning After a few more
sessions well formulate something
that works for your individual
requirements By this time next
week --

MILAR
-- I wont be here

Milar gets up and walks out of the meeting The bewildered
members watch him go

INT EXT FACTORY - LOADING DOCK - DAY

Uniform boxes are loaded into the back of a container truck
under the supervision of armed GUARDS

As the shipment is driven away GATES notices a trash can
sitting nearby On closer inspection he finds the can
contains the internal mechanism of a television set He
nervously wheels the incriminating garbage away

INT FACTORY - ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY

YAEGER and EMMETT man their own work stations GATES sidles
up to them

GATES
(under his breath)
That last shipment -- the manifest
was not entirely in order

Yaegers eyes dart to Milars work station -- VACANT

Emmett produces a wrench from his overalls and loosens a belt
on the assembly line causing it to stall An alarm sounds
alerting Maintenance Anticipating the delay several of the
WORKERS exit through a side door

EXT FACTORY ROOF - DAY

YAEGER EMMETT and several OTHERS lie on the factory roof to
observe the highly policed World Bridge through a single pair
of binoculars that Yaeger monopolizes

EXT WORLD BRIDGE - DAY

We focus on a tractor-trailer entering the inspection gate of
the bridge

YAEGER
-- With something that size hes
got a chance

EMMETT
How in hell did he get in there

GATES
You seen what a bag of bones he is

YAEGER
(nodding in agreement)
Thank God for poor nutrition

Through the binoculars Yaeger observes a GUARD checking the
trucks undersides with an extension mirror The guard waves
the truck through

YAEGER
(voice raising in
excitement)
-- Damn he passed inspection

We focus on the trucks tires nearing the metallic center
span of the bridge

EVERS
Another turn of those tires and
hes officially an export

The tires move then suddenly stop The truck is flagged down
inches short of the center span by a FOOT PATROL with CANINE
UNIT

YAEGER
Where did that mutt come from

The sniffer-dog inspecting the outside of the trucks
container becomes increasingly excited until it is tearing

at the metal The HANDLER blows a shrill whistle halting
traffic

EXT BOARDING HOUSE - VERANDAH - DAY

VERA home-schooling HECTOR is alerted by the sound of the
whistle She runs to the fenceline HECTOR close behind

EXT WORLD BRIDGE - DAY

An apparently innocent-looking 27 television monitor its
packing torn away sits incongruously on the bridge at the
feet of CHIEF GIDEON Rifle on his arm he circles the TV
set

He nods to VALENTINE who pries out a piece of plastic
masquerading as the TV screen We discover the contorted
body of MILAR folded into the impossible small space of the
TV case

Even in this contorted position Milar is able to make eye

contact with the border chief Gideon gently prods Milars

cheek with the rifle barrel then nods again to VALENTINE

With the help of ANOTHER GUARD they lift the television onto
the ledge of the bridge and toss it over the side

VALENTINE
Happy landings Houdini

The television hits the river and sinks like a stone
EXT BOARDING HOUSE FENCELINE - DAY

From the boarding house VERA and HECTOR anxiously scan the
surface for any sign of Milar Finally he appears amongst

the debris of the shattered television case He floats

concussed back towards the near bank where he is hauled to
shore

EXT WORLD BRIDGE - DAY

VALENTINE reaches across the ceremonial center line of the
bridge with a bucket on a rope He dredges the river for
soil

INT BORDER STATION - NIGHT

MILAR sits shackled on a concrete bench in a concrete cell
GIDEON stands opposite staring down his rifle barrel at the
would-be border crosser

GIDEON
Congratulations Milar You were
no more than the length of this
rifle from the center line of the
bridge -- in which case you would
have been beyond my jurisdiction

Gideon takes a seat beside Milar

GIDEON
You have to realize that when you
attempt to cross you dont just
take from us -- you give to them --
you give heart to the other side
You give them the impression that
we are desperate

MILAR
Arent we

GIDEON
We dont know that things are
really any better over there

MILAR
-- Must be why theyre all swimming
this way

GIDEON

(face hardening fingering

his rifle)
The decision to use deadly force is
left to the discretion of the
individual officer Many favor a
shoot-on-sight policy since ones
options upon making an arrest are
severely limited Incarceration is
out of the question You dont
lock up a man whos already in
jail Why should I feed you three
meals a day when you can only feed
yourself two

(motioning Valentine

forward)
I have been forced to improvise a
punishment that in my mind fits
the crime -- to cure you of your
appetite for foreign soil

The bucket of muddy west bank soil is placed in front of
Milar At the same time a GUARD clamps Milars mouth open
Valentine scoops up a ladleful of earth from his bucket

GIDEON
The first attempt buys you one
bucket the second two Nobodys
ever eaten three

We focus on the gritty dirt as it is force-fed down Milars
open throat gagging with each mouthful

EXT RIVER ROAD - NIGHT

From outside their properties the RESIDENTS keep up a vigil
-- watching the light in the border station where Milars
ordeal is taking place YAEGER holds court playing the
board game with EMMETT drinking weak beer

YAEGER

(musing on events)
-- The physical implications of
being force-fed soil are
significant -- abrasions of the
oesophagus tearing of the stomach
lining rupture of the intestinal
tract -- it doesnt get any
prettier the further south you go

They wince at his description
INT BOARDING HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

From her kitchen VERA also keeps up a vigil watching the
light in the border station HECTOR watches his mother
watch

INT BORDER STATION - DAWN

We FOCUS on Milars bloated stomach The scratched and
bloodied MILAR finishes the last spoonful of earth from the
bucket under the sadistic supervision of GIDEON and
VALENTINE

GIDEON
What do you have to say for
yourself now Milar

The groggy Milar struggles to focus on the border chief

MILAR
(hoarse from the dirt
scratching his throat)
You are what you eat

Valentine punishes Milar for his insolence by smashing him
across the face with the empty pail
EXT BORDER STATION - DAWN

MILARs barely conscious body bloated with west bank soil
is unceremoniously dumped outside the border station
YAEGER EMMETT and GATES go to him and ferry him away

INT BOARDING HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

MILAR still groggy is lain out on a table by YAEGER and
EMMETT

YAEGER
(aside to Vera admiring a
new bottle of olive oil)
-- Gone to a lot of trouble Vera

VERA
I already lost one tenant this
month

Yaeger smiles unconvinced He and Emmett begin to work on
Milar -- trying to pump his stomach while VERA pours a
mixture of water and olive oil down his throat to encourage
vomiting into the bucket that HECTOR holds

VERA
(to Milar)
Youre lucky --

MILAR
(after throwing up)
I feel lucky

VERA
-- he could have shot you

YAEGER
Shes right Your next attempt is
going to take planning preparation
and --
MILAR
-- I need to go

They stare at him for a moment unsure what he means

MILAR
(trying to get off the
table)
I need to go

VERA
Help him up He needs to go

They help Milar to the bathroom closing the door to give him
privacy A pained cry comes from the other side of the door

YAEGER
Like shitting glass

EMMETT
Like giving birth

Vera shakes her head at Emmetts persistent stupidity
INT EXT INDUSTRIAL PARK - FACTORY ENTRANCE - DAY

The WORKERS line up to collect their wages from the pay
window As MILAR reaches the window MALDANO takes a large
cut from Milars wages

MALDANO
Down-payment -- on that TV you
bought

Milar takes whats left of his meager wages and exits without
comment

LEON
(calling out from the back
of the line)
Youre a sell-out Maldano You
sold your soul
MALDANO
(sneering)
I got a good price Leon

The other MEN muzzle Leon before he gets himself into serious
trouble YAEGER and the others follow Milar out of the
entrance

YAEGER

(struggling to keep up

with Milar)
-- Obviously youll be feeling gun
shy Thats understandable But
youll get your confidence back
Its just a matter of re-grouping
You do still want to go

MILAR
Oh no I want to rot away on this
landfill with you no-hopers Of
course Im going

EVERS
Thats the spirit

EXT WORLD BRIDGE - DAY - SOMETIME EARLIER

A line of TRACTOR TRAILERS waits to cross the bridge under a
searing sun

YAEGER (VO)
The drawback with bridge crossings
is thats the first thing the goons
look for

Suddenly smoke billows from the hood of one of the trucks
YAEGER (VO)

Engine compartments have their
limitations
A BORDER GUARD flings open the hood to find a MAN and WOMAN
folded into the engine compartment their clothing on fire

desperately trying to escape The sadistic guard slams the

hood back down

INT EXT CONTAINER - DAY - SOMETIME EARLIER

A WORKER loading boxes into a container under the
supervision of a GUARD discovers that the last box in the
row wont fit

YAEGER (VO)
False walls are also prone to
detection

An ax splinters the container wall to reveal a terrified
BORDER CROSSER crammed into the false compartment his face
a whisker away from the ax blade

INT TRAVEL BUREAU YAEGERS HOUSE - NIGHT

We return to the present where we find YAEGER conducting an
impromptu meeting of the Travel Bureau EMMETT GATES LEON
and EVERS are in attendance However the meeting is mostly

for MILARs benefit

YAEGER
(reminiscing)
Karl Salgardo and I prepared for
months for his crossing Karls
idea was to be one with the bridge

EXT WORLD BRIDGE - DAY - SOMETIME EARLIER

We focus on a GUARD patrolling the bridge The camera cranes
down to find KARL attempting to rappel along the underside of
the bridge using an intricate arrangement of ropes and

pulleys while encased in a cardboard box camouflaged as part

of the bridge structure

However he must also negotiate a razorwire fence at the
underbelly of the bridge As he starts to cut the wire his
boltcutters slip from his hand and into the river

Realizing he has given himself away Salgardo desperately
tries to crawl over the razorwire GUARDS on the near back
open fire with automatic weapons Salgardos fall into the
river is broken by the razorwire leaving him hanging there
in a macabre advertisement to the folly of his act

INT TRAVEL BUREAU - NIGHT - PRESENT

EMMETT
What about Calvin

YAEGER
Calvin Lido I take no
responsibility for that

EXT BRIDGE - DUSK - SOMETIME EARLIER

We focus on the center of the bridge With the passage of
trucks ended for the day a barrier has been erected

Suddenly a motorcycle appears out of nowhere roaring onto
the apron of the near side of the bridge -- a motorcycle

ridden by CALVIN LIDO He attempts to leap the barrier The
motorcycle disappears over the blockade and out of view All
we See is the resulting fireball

INT TRAVEL BUREAU - NIGHT

YAEGER looks to MILAR gazing through the window irritated
that he does not appear to be paying full attention

YAEGER
Are you listening to a word Im
saying Because I can tell you
your dues dont even cover this
kind of private tuition --

MILAR
-- What happened to Vera

The MEN follow Milars gaze to the source of his distraction
Vera has stopped hanging her washing to pick wild flowers
from the bank

YAEGER
(a painful memory)
Shes got more reason than most to
hate the border Her husbands
buried under it

INT TUNNEL - NIGHT - SOMETIME EARLIER

ANGELO a man in his twenties digs by weak flashlight in a
narrow tunnel

YAEGER (VO)
Tunnels were a way to get to the
river until Angelo His was the
first to go under it

Angelo checks the length of the tunnel by the calibrations he
has made on a piece of rope The tunnel has progressed
beyond a small red flag attached to the rope

He allows himself a brief smile of satisfaction Producing a
piece of chalk he draws a line down the tunnel wall On one
side of the line he inscribes the initials FEA The

other side he inscribes FEA

He scoops a piece of foreign soil from the wall of the tunnel
on the west side of the line into a small tin can

INT BOARDING HOUSE - DAY - SOMETIME EARLIER

We focus on a wardrobe in a modest bedroom From a concealed
shaft in the wardrobe floor ANGELO emerges with a large
bucket of earth He passes the bucket to a younger VERA

baby HECTOR on her hip

YAEGER (VO)
Before it was a boarding house it
was Angelos family home He
started the tunnel in the very room
he was born in and his son was born
in

ANGELO gives the can of dirt to his tiny son He disappears
back into the tunnel

YAEGER (VO)
He did the digging Vera got rid
of what he dug

EXT RIVER ROAD PUMP - DAY - SOMETIME EARLIER

VERA baby on her hip carries two water buckets down to the
pump

As she walks we focus on the bottom of a bucket It is
leaking a steady stream of dirt When she reaches the pump
with her now empty buckets she plugs the holes and fills the
buckets with water Vera smiles flirtatiously at XAVIER the
local snitch who is none the wiser

EXT RIVER - FENCELINE - NIGHT - SOMETIME EARLIER

It is a balmy evening on the river VERA sits with HECTOR at
the fenceline the baby playing with his shiny can of
souvenir soil

YAEGER (VO)
He was halfway there

We focus on the gently flowing water Suddenly a whirlpool
appears in the middle of the river

A GUARD in a tower sees the strange phenomenon and whistles
an alert VERA runs to the house

INT BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT - SOMETIME EARLIER

River water is streaming out of the wardrobe VERA ankle
deep in water stares helplessly into the shaft

GUARDS burst into the room led by GIDEON The border chief
fires his rifle into the shaft The water subsides as if
wounded by the bullet but no body emerges

INT TRAVEL BUREAU - NIGHT

Back in the present the MEN watch as VERA clutching her
bunch of flowers enters the room that used to contain the
tunnel entrance

YAEGER
(reflecting)
Its too bad

EMMETT
(missing the point as
usual)
Damn right We could have gotten a
lot of people through that tunnel

YAEGER
(to Milar attempting to
lift the mood)
Anyhow onwards and upwards What
have you got in mind

MILAR
Im going to swim the river

They laugh

MILAR
I know what Im doing Ive been
watching the rats -- leaving the
sinking ship The guards like to
use them for target practice -- but
the rats that make it swim
underwater As long as you dont
surface you can reach the far
bank Once you do you keep on
swimming right up the waste pipes
Thats the way through -- through
the sewage system
The group continues to smirk and chortle

MILAR
What the hell is wrong with all of
you

YAEGER
Nothing Swimming the river is an
interesting idea --

EMMETT
-- as long as you do it in the
Spring

Milar is confused They lead him out of the house to the
fenceline

EXT FENCELINE - DAY

MILAR finally gets the joke The river has dried to a
trickle

MILAR
Where did the water go

GATES
Dried up overnight

EVERS
Dried up early this year

YAEGER
It always does this Itll come
back You just have to wait for
Spring

MILAR
(storming away)
Im not waiting for Spring You
wait for the Spring Im not
waiting
EXT BOARDING HOUSE - DUSK

MILAR wander down to the fenceline still angry at the river
that has betrayed him

At the bottom of the property he finds HECTOR hidden behind
an abandoned truck tire Hector loads a homemade slingshot
with small dark pellets and fires them through one fence to

the electric fence beyond Milar observes the boy with mild
amusement

MILAR
(referring to the
ammunition)
Sheep

HECTOR
Goat

The goat droppings occasionally strike the electrified fence
wire causing a spark and a small plume of smoke

HECTOR
(never taking his eyes
from his target)
Milar why does God put a soul ina
body on this side of the river
instead of that side

MILAR
Gods old His aims not so good
anymore

HECTOR
Thats what I say Its a mistake
Why else would we be so close You
and me we were never meant to be
here

A patrolling GUARD nears the bombarded portion of the
electric fence Milar and Hector duck out of sight The
guard covers his nose from the stench and looks around for
the source Finding nothing he moves on From their hiding
place MILAR and HECTOR struggle to suppress their laughter

Milar notices the boy holding the tin can that he wears
around his neck

MILAR
Can I see it

Hector reverently opens the lid to reveal the can is full of
dirt

MILAR
(regarding the dirt
indistinguishable from
any other)
Thats it alright

INT BOARDING HOUSE - DUSK

From the boarding house VERA observes MILAR and HECTOR
parting company She greets HECTOR at the door

VERA
(referring to Milar)
Dont get used to having him
around Hector Whether he makes
it or not youre not going to see
him again

We sense Vera is speaking for herself as much as Hector
EXT RIVER ROAD - OUTDOOR MARKEY - DAY

At an outdoor market across the road from the factory VERA
buys dress fabric As she walks home HELLERs car pulls

alongside her

HELLER
Can I give you a ride Vera
VERA
Thanks Mr Heller its a nice
day for a walk

HELLER
Youre right

Heller steps out of his car and falls into step beside her
The DRIVER continues to follow the pair Vera cannot help
but smile at the gesture

HELLER
When can I see you Vera Is your
social calender so full

Vera smiles again

HELLER
What are you afraid of that you
might like me Most women around
here would jump at the chance

VERA
Then why arent you with one of
them

They near the boarding house

HELLER
Im not the enemy Vera
(nodding to Hector
standing at the
fenceline)
Your sons growing up I wont
keep asking

The remark gets Veras attention

As Heller enters the car he notices a PAINTER approaching
the fence

HELLER
You cant cross the border but at
least its going to be prettier

Heller drives off Vera looks closely at the painter
EXT FENCELINE ADJACENT TO PUMP - MORNING

A PAINTER with paint cans brushes rollers and ladders
approaches the fenceline near the pump He begins to paint
the fence A nearby GUARD watches him closely

After painting one section the painter climbs over the fence
on his ladder and begins to paint the other side attracting
even closer scrutiny from the GUARD The painter crosses
back to his original side and paints another section The
painter continues in this manner back and forth over both
fences We focus on the painters face -- MILAR

EXT RIVER ROAD - BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

VERA stands by the boarding house with YAEGER and EMMETT who
have also become aware of the painter

EMMETT
Maybe he acquired a taste for that
dirt

VERA
Has he got some kind of death-wish
Yaeger

YAEGER
Just the opposite Id say

Vera goes back to the house Trying not to draw attention to
themselves playing their board game the other RESIDENTS of
River Road -- OTTO EVERS GATES LEON follow Milars
progress

YAEGER
(unabashed admiration)
That is beautiful What border
crosser in his right mind crosses
the fence then crosses back

EMMETT
You put your finger on it His
mind is not right

GATES
(referring to the Guards
in the towers)
Why dont they stop him

YAEGER
Theyre goons They all think some
higher-up ordered it Hes
putting them to sleep

EMMETT
Hes making me tired

Sure enough the Guards in the towers and on patrol have
become bored watching MILAR work now taking him for granted

VERA comes out to fetch her washing -- coincidentally it
gives her an opportunity to observe the goings-on

VERA
Hector come inside

YAEGER
You have to watch Vera

VERA
Im not watching
(insistent)
And neither are you Hector Get
inside

Hector reluctantly obeys his mother However now it is Vera
who cannot resist watching sneaking a glance between the
washing
EXT FENCELINE - RIVERBANK - DUSK

As the sun begins to set the floodlights and music are
coming on MILAR rinses off one of his brushes He regards
the muddy river A WADER BIRD feeds in the slime

Milar surreptitiously reaches into his overalls and produces
what appears to be a homemade snorkel He glances to the
tower on the near bank and the tower on the far bank The
SENTRIES appear to have their binoculars focused elsewhere

He places the incongruous-looking J-shaped tube into his
mouth and in the blink of an eye MILAR dives headfirst into
the mud The head of aGUARD snaps around However all he
sees is the startled wader bird fly off Milar lies

motionless in the bog covered by a protective blanket of mud

EXT RIVER ROAD - DUSK

VERA YAEGER EMMETT and the OTHERS are shocked by the bold
move

EMMETT
Did they see him They had to see
him

YAEGER

No He tranquilized them
EXT FENCELINE - RIVERBANK - DUSK

Incredibly not one of the GUARDS on either side of the river
has witnessed Milars plunge

We focus on the tip of Milars AIR PIPE barely visible
through the mud and indistinguishable amongst the other
debris littering the riverbed He lies there motionless --
just another lump of mud in a river of mud -- breathing
through the piece of hose Then ever so slowly he begins
to crawl inch by inch through the sludge

The ONLOOKERS continue sneaking glances to the river through
a pair of shared binoculars They talk to each other in
anxious whispers

Now even VERA cannot resist watching

VERA
Where is he

Yaeger mildly surprised by her interest peering through his
binoculars at the garbage-strewn river

YAEGER
By that tire I think

VERA
Why isnt he moving

YAEGER
He is Hes just doing it real
slow

EVERS
Hes going to crawl across right
under their noses

HECTOR
(a trace of hero worship)
Hes going to swim a river that
isnt there

Hector has also come back out of the house figuring if its
okay for his mother its okay for him

EXT RIVERBED - NIGHT

The floodlights on both banks bathe the riverbed in an eerie
glow MILAR continuing to crawl at his agonizingly slow pace
has almost reached the narrow six foot wide channel that cuts
through the mud -- all that remains of the river

YAEGER
(keeping up his whispered
commentary)
-- Hes almost at the channel --
Soon as hes past that hell be
officially over kissing the
Republic Then he keeps on
crawling -- all the way to Shit
Falls and up their wastepipe --
just got to time his entry between
flushes

We focus on a waste pipe on the far bank spewing sewage

EMMETT
(regarding the waste pipes
on the far bank)
Interesting how all mammals mark
their territory with piss and shit

YAEGER
Thank shit for their shit Long as
they keep pissing and shitting in
our direction we got a way over

VERA
Those pipes You sure its wide
enough

YAEGER
-- Tight fit should be okay

EMMETT
(shrugs)
They forgot how bad we eat

Suddenly a gate opens on the near bank GIDEON emerges
taking a stroll along the border with VALENTINE

YAEGER
Damn

EMMETT
What
YAEGER
Gideon

EMMETT
Its his day off

VERA
He never takes a day off

EXT RIVER - NIGHT

GIDEON rests his hand on a fence post He feels moisture
beneath his hand and curiously examines the wet paint on his
palm He regards the ladder and paint cans left at the base
of the fence

GIDEON
(to the nearby Valentine)
Who ordered this

VALENTINE
You did I thought

GIDEON
How many were there

VERA
(picking up on Gideons
concern)
One

GIDEON
Where is he

VALENTINE
Knocked-off for the day

GIDEON
(kicking the ladder lying
on the ground)
Did he fly back over the fence
Valentine blanches

But Gideon is now focused on a trail of tiny paint drops that
lead from the fence to the edge of the sludgy river where the
trail stops Gideon puts his finger to the last paint drop

It is still moist He looks back over his shoulder to River
Road where he detects a glint off the binoculars

GIDEON
(looking out into the
slime)
Hes still here

Gideon rifle poised starts to wade through the sludge
towards the center of the virtually stagnant river the
international boundary still marked by the buoy

We focus on the outline of MILAR barely distinguishable
amidst the mud He has almost made it to what remains of the
canal Hearing the approaching guards Milar freezes

We focus on the life-giving AIR PIPE Ever so delicately
GIDEONs fingers appear in frame Taking great care not to
disturb the pipe itself Gideon plugs the mouth of the pipe
with a piece of mud

At first there is no reaction from Milar Then suddenly
from what looks like a benign patch of riverbed Milar
lurches up gasping desperately for air VALENTINE clubs
Milar back to the ground with the butt of his rifle

EXT RIVER ROAD - FENCELINE - NIGHT

YAEGER EMMETT VERA HECTOR and the others lower their
heads crestfallen

EXT RIVERBED - NIGHT
As MILAR is dragged away VALENTINE signals a SUBORDINATE by

holding up two fingers The GUARD approaches through the
sludge with two metal buckets Valentine reaches across the
boundary line and dredges up earth from what is technically
the other side of the border

INT BORDER STATION - NIGHT

MILAR the mud hosed off him is back on his concrete bench
GIDEON enters the cell carrying his beloved rifle

GIDEON
I know you dont recognize the
border Milar You might recognize
this

Two buckets of earth are now placed in front of Milar
Resigned to his fate Milar takes the ladle from VALENTINE
and begins to feed himself

INT BOARDING HOUSE - MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

From her kitchen VERA gazed at the light in the border
station HECTOR enters

HECTOR
Will he die

VERA
(a warning to her son)
He will if he keeps this up

HECTOR
Maybe Milar can get us all across
Then we wont have to go with the
foreigner

VERA
(shocked)
Who said we were going with the
foreigner

Hector knows better than to reply

VERA
(angry)
I can tell you one thing Hector
Mr Klines not thinking of
getting anyone over but himself
So you can get that idea out of
your head

INT BORDER STATION - NIGHT

We focus on a corner of the cell An empty bucket is placed
there

DISSOLVE TO
INT BORDER STATION - DAY

The light has changed to morning A second empty bucket
clatters to the floor MILAR dazed and bloated follows the
bucket He lands next to GIDEONs boot

GIDEON

(racking a cartridge into

the breach of his rifle)
You have now provided me with two
opportunities to dispatch you to a
paradise not of this earth Have
you wondered why I dont kill you
Milar

MILAR
-- Has crossed my mind

GIDEON
You might imagine that I think your
existence utterly worthless Quite
the contrary You serve a vital
purpose to me Not only do your
efforts alleviate the boredom you
are my check and balance -- my
control I have come to believe
that if I can prevent you from
crossing I can prevent anyone If
you are here I know the border is
secure

Milar idly wipes the dust off Gideons boot that happens to
be close to his face

MILAR
What has this dirt ever done for
you Mr Gideon

Gideon crouches down close beside Milars face He talks to
him as if imparting fatherly advice

GIDEON

Thankfully thats not my concern
Iam not a politician You may be
surprised to learn not even a
patriot Countries can disappoint
you Milar Governments rise and
fall ideologies go in and out of
favor sometimes even the names of
the nations change Thats why I
have love for no land What I love
is the line The rule of law
sovereignty you can trust a line
Milar I urge you not to cross
mine again

(whispering a reminder in

his ear)
Ihave seen men eat two buckets
never three

Milar is dragged from the cell
INT BOARDING HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

MILAR lies on his table with his usual group of STOMACH
PUMPERS around him

YAEGER
-- What you did was pure poetry
EVERS
-- Hiding in plain sight

GATES
-- Part of the landscape

EMMETT
-- Part of the garbage

OTTO
-- Genius

VERA
(whispering in his ear)
You just cant leave us can you

MILAR
Im trying

Milar turns over and throws up
EXT BOARDING HOUSE - MILARS ROOM - DUSK

MILAR sits at the doorway of the bunk house recuperating
VERA delivers a bow of thin soup HECTOR delivers a straw
through which to drink it Even this act is painful

VERA
(trying to make light)
You forget the borders closed

MILAR
Guess Im a slow learner
(a hesitation first
moment of doubt)
Maybe I should try another
district Might have better luck
in 32nd

Vera exchanged a look with Hector

VERA
Got your papers

Milar perplexed reaches into his overalls for his Internal
Passport He hands it to Vera

VERA

(referring to a stamp in

the passport)
Youve got to read the fine print
This stamp permits entry to the
district not exit

(meeting his gaze)
You knew that right

MILAR
(unconvincing)
Sure

EXT RIVER - DUSK

The head of a FLASH FLOOD carrying a seasons debris ahead
of it sweeps around the crescent-shaped bend in the river

After the flood passes the river is once again restored
extending from bank to bank

EXT RIVER ROAD - NIGHT

It is a quiet night along River Road The newly-filled river
gently flowing

INT LEONS HOUSE - NIGHT
A phonograph plays a lullaby as LEON tucks his BABY to sleep
EXT RIVER ROAD - NIGHT

Suddenly the lights go out all along River Road Leons
phonograph dies His BABY cries

LEON (OS)
Damn it
Leon emerges from his house carrying bolt-cutters and a long
jumper-cable The baby continues to cry in the background

LEON
(sarcastically to the
nearest border tower)
Im glad your powers still on

WIFE
(following him with the
baby)
Come back here Leon

But it is too late Leon is cutting through the fence

WIFE
Stop it

LEON
(brushing off his wife)
No Ive had it with these
criminals

From outside his bunk house MILAR sees Leon slide through
the fence into the border road directly in front of a
disbelieving GUARD

GUARD
Halt

Leon goes to attach his cable to the electric fence

MILAR
Dont do it Leon

Leon hesitates Milar is the first resident to reach the
fenceline

The commotion has attracted the attention of the other River

Road residents uncertain what to do The guard gun raised

is also frozen at the prospect of Leon frying himself The

BABY continues to cry Despite the GUARD MILAR tentatively
approaches the fence

MILAR
Its not even the right voltage

LEON
(tears of frustration in
his eyes)
Its not right I just got him off
to sleep They got power for the
fence Its not right

MILAR

(referring to the baby)
Hell go back to sleep Well just
sing to him You want me to sing
Ill sing

(taking the baby from his

mothers arm he starts

to sing)
Rock-a-bye baby on the treetop
when the wind blows the cradle will
rock

VERA YAEGER and the other RESIDENTS tentatively join in as
Milar slips through the fence

RESIDENTS
When the bough breaks the cradle
will fall and down will come baby
cradle and all

The baby stops crying Milar has reached Leon VERA watches
in wonder

MILAR
(whispering nodding to
the baby in his arms)
The babys asleep Leon You
electrocute yourself youll just
wake him up again
Milar gently takes the cable from Leons outstretched hand
and gives him the baby He leads Leon back through the fence
-- the guard covering them all the way

As Leon is reunited with his wife and friends the power
suddenly comes back on along River Road The phonograph
picks up the song

PHONOGRAPH
down will come baby cradle
and all

The RESIDENTS regard Milar in awe Even GIDEON in his
tower has his binoculars trained on MILAR as he makes his
way back to the boarding house

VERA
(falling into step beside
Milar)
I told you we were cursed

MILAR
I dont know I think Leon made a
lot of sense

VERA
You cant still be thinking about
crossing You forgotten where you
stand

MILAR
No Thats the problem

VERA

(meeting his gaze)
Gideon will kill you the next time

(softening)
You dont have to go now Theres
no shame You dont have to go
ever No ones going to say
anything -- Id see to that Dying
of embarrassment --
(trying to make light)
-- its better than actually dying

MILAR
Thats a matter of opinion
(meeting her gaze)
I just cant accept it Vera How
can it be on this patch of dirt we
make in a year what we could make
on that patch of dirt in a day

VERA
Thats just the way it is with
dirt Its not worth it Milar

MILAR
Wasnt it worth it to your husband

VERA
(taken aback by the
mention)
That was different

MILAR
Why

VERA
He was building a tunnel to get us
all through He wasnt just going
for himself
(saying what Milar is
perhaps thinking)
Maybe thats where he went wrong

MILAR
I cant accept it Vera I wont

EXT BOARDING HOUSE FENCELINE - DAY

A BORDER GUARD is ferried away from his lookout post on a
stretcher Another GUARD takes his place
From the boarding house VERA watches the fallen guard with
concer

MILAR and YAEGER stand at the fenceline also regarding the
stretcher

YAEGER
Strains dont usually come so close
together Got to be something
special if the guards are dropping
(sensing Milars unease)
Youll be alright Just dont
breathe in the wrong piece of air

MILAR
Ill keep it in mind

HECTOR sweating profusely hurries up to the men

HECTOR
Tower Four Nobodys home

They all immediately understand the significance

MILAR
Four Thats near the pipeline
(to Hector)
Hector get me a pack of
cigarettes

HECTOR
(knowing smile)
You dont smoke

MILAR
Thats right I dont -- do I

Hector smiles conspiratorially and hurries away Milar and
Yaeger exchange a look

MILAR
What do you think
YAEGER
Five eights fixed wrench ought to
do it

Otto withdraws the appropriate wrench from a set of tools
sewn into the lining of his coat He hands it to Milar

EXT FENCE PIPELINE - DAY

We focus on an oil pipeline that traverses the river a mile
upstream from River Road -- ringed with a halo of barbed-wire
at its center

MILAR cuts through the fenceline By crawling onto the

pipeline commando-style he is able to avoid the scrutiny of

the FAR BANK GUARDS However he appears to be in full view
of a watchtower on the near bank

EXT WATCHTOWER FOUR - DAY

On closer inspection we discover that the BORDER GUARD
staring at the river from his watchtower has the telltale
yellow lesions on his face and hands A FLY alights on the
guards dry lips The guard does not brush the fly away

The guard is dead

EXT PIPELINE - DAY

MILAR still hidden from the far bank guards carefully
loosens a bolt on the seam of the pipeline Oil begins to
ooze from the pipe into the river Milar shimmies back along
the pipe onto the near bank

INT BOARDING HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

HECTOR standing on a footstool goes through the kitchen
cupboards He spies a pack of cigarettes He is suddenly
unsteady on his feet From his POV the letters on the pack
swim together

VERA enters the house She hears a thud from the kitchen
VERA
Hector what are you doing

Hector lies on the ground clutching the cigarettes Vera
does not run to him as we might expect but walks slowly as
if to the guillotine She examines Hectors face -- it bears
the familiar yellow lesions

HECTOR
Milar needs the cigarettes

She picks up her son and lays him on his bed

HECTOR
Please

Vera takes the cigarettes from the boys hand She looks
towards the river

EXT RIVER FENCELINE - DUSK

A large oil slick flows downstream MILAR hurries back along
River Road keeping up with the head of the slick grinning

all the while He runs into VERA She hands him Hectors
cigarettes

MILAR
Thanks

He lights two cigarettes at once and lights a third for Vera
who is trying to conceal her unease

Milar glances anxiously to the widening slick in the river
and the GUARDS on patrol

MILAR
Think they know yet

VERA
Not yet Cant smell it over the
rest of the garbage
Milar quickens his pace to keep up with the discharge When
they reach a relatively unsupervised section of fenceline
Milar stops He tests the wind with his finger

MILAR
(nodding to Vera)
Okay

He throws his first cigarette over the fence Caught on the
wind the cigarette lands in the shallows of the river but
fails to catch the oil alight

Vera follows suit On a bigger gust her cigarette carries
further It lands in an oily sludge and suddenly ignites the
river

Milar embraces her in his enthusiasm Suddenly whistles
sound from the GUARD TOWERS

EXT GIDEONS GUARD TOWER - DUSK

GIDEON cleaning his beloved rifle is caught off-guard by
the alert and hurries to the towers balcony He is greeted
by the sight of the river fully ablaze

EXT BORDER STATION - HYDRANT - DUSK

YAEGER keeps watch as EMMETT and OTTO sabotage a hydrant near
the pump

EXT PUMP BRIDGE - DUSK

MILAR running along the fenceline with VERA enjoys the
sight of the GUARDS unnerved by the sheets of fire in the
river threatening to leap up the bank

MILAR
Will you look at that
(a thought occurring)
Wheres Hector Hes got to see
this
Vera averts her eyes Milar senses something amiss

MILAR
Where is he Whats wrong

VERA
(unconvincing)
Hell be okay

Milar realizes the significance of the remark

VERA
(gesturing to the bridge
behind him)
Milar the bridge

Flames lick around the side of the bridge The freight
trucks are stopped at the bridge entrance The flames
threaten to consume the guard towers Terrified BORDER
GUARDS run for their lives leaving the gate unsupervised

The bridge now ablaze presents an opportunity to anyone
willing to run the gauntlet of fire Near the water pump
Vera removes her dress Standing in only her slip she dunks
the dress in water and puts the sodden garment around Milar
to protect him from the flames

VERA
Go Get out of here

Milar hesitates
EXT FENCELINE - DUSK

GIDEON striding towards the bridge with VALENTINE screams
to his fleeing GUARDS

GIDEON
Forget the fire the fence Watch
the fence
EXT BRIDGE - DUSK
MILAR and VERA spy GIDEON and VALENTINE approaching

VERA
Go Milar

Wrapping his head with the wet clothing Milar finally runs
for the unattended bridge

Gideon sees him at the last second He raises his rifle and

shoots as Milar disappears into the flames Before Gideon

can shoot a second time YAEGER and EMMETT disrupt his aim
running interference pretending to beat back the flames with

their coats

YAEGER
-- Careful Mr Gideon

EMMETT
-- Keep back Its dangerous

Gideon angrily shoves them aside shooting into the fire
more concerned with Milars escape than his own safety
Other GUARDS also fire until their guns are empty

EXT BRIDGE - NIGHT - LATER

GUARDS finally arrive to douse the flames The bridge is
partially blackened but intact Yaeger and Emmett stand with
Vera None of them can take their eyes off the empty bridge

YAEGER
(placing his coat around
Vera)
Hes gone

VERA
Hectors sick

YAEGER
(immediately
understanding
sympathetic)
The clinics closed

VERA
(turning back to the
house)
Im going to see the foreigner

INT BOARDING HOUSE - MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

HECTOR lies beneath the betting of his bed eyes open

staring the thousand-yard stare YAEGER and EMMETT tend to
the boy VERA returns to the boarding house over-dressed

and over-made-up

YAEGER
What happened Does the foreigner
have serum

VERA
(numb)
Hes away for ten days The virus
kills you in two

EXT GARBAGE DUMP - MORNING

We focus on a used syringe -- the merest drop of liquid in

the bottom VERA places the syringe in a bag with other used
syringes and continues wading through the trash searching for
serum She looks incongruous amongst the other TRASH
PICKERS wearing baskets and using broomsticks with nail
attachments YAEGER half-heartedly helps her search

YAEGER
Its hopeless Vera Its anew
strain what use is old vaccine

She takes another step and loses her balance

When she gets up her hand is bloodied by the syringes but
she does not appear to notice Yaeger takes the bag from her
and she falls into his arms

VERA
Yaeger what am I going to do

INT BOARDING HOUSE - MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

HECTORs yellow fingers are clasped around his precious tin

of foreign soil VERA nurses the rapidly fading HECTOR
YAEGER unable to watch joins LEON and EVERS at the doorway
overlooking the fenceline

Down on the border road GIDEON is supervising the
reinforcement of the fence with a new layer of razor-wire

YAEGER
(whispered aside to Leon)
-- for a kid always in such a
hurry hes taking his own sweet
time dying

LEON
(looking across the river)
Its acrime That whole countrys
a pharmacy

Yaeger is too heartsick even to offer a response EVERS is
not paying any attention He is focused on the bridge

EVERS
How many you ever see go over
Yaeger -- for real

YAEGER
(distracted mind
elsewhere)
A handful

EVERS
Ever see anyone come back

Yaegers gaze follows Evers to a movement on the far bank of
the river
EXT BRIDGE FAR FENCE - NIGHT

On the far side of the bridge a whistle sounds The gate
opens and a lone figure emerges -- MILAR He begins to walk
unsteadily back across the bridge

His appearance interrupts the erection of the new fence and
attracts the attention of the near bank GUARDS a chorus of
whistles

GUARD
(to his colleague)
Never seen that before

EXT RIVER ROAD - NIGHT

Other RESIDENTS are roused from their homes including VERA
They watch in awe MILARs progress across the bridge

EXT WORLD BRIDGE - NIGHT

MILAR crosses the bridges metal border strip into the
waiting arms of a near bank PATROL led by GIDEON and
VALENTINE The guards handcuff Milar

GIDEON
You lost Milar Youre going the
wrong way

VALENTINE
They catch you

MILAR
Homesick I missed you

Valentine restrains himself with difficulty Using a bucket
on a rope he reaches across the center line of the bridge to
dredge the river for west bank soil

VALENTINE
(preparing to draw three
bucketfuls)
I do believe the third bucket will
kill him

Milar is marched back across the bridge
EXT BRIDGE ENTRANCE GATE - NIGHT

Outside the border station a small GROUP has gathered to
regard the novelty of MILARs repatriation -- including
YAEGER and VERA

As he is lead towards the Border Station Milar leans towards
Vera standing on the other side of the fence

MILAR
Vera arent you going to kiss me
hello

Through the gap in the fence he gives Vera a deep kiss He
is roughly escorted away

As Milar enters the border station we stay with the startled
Vera She produces a small bottle from her mouth
transferred in the kiss It is a vial of vaccine

EMMETT
(observing the vial
whispered)
Whats that

YAEGER
That Emmett is what they call
the kiss of life
They follow Vera as she runs towards the boarding house

INT BORDER STATION - NIGHT

We focus on a corner of the cell An empty bucket is placed
there
DISSOLVE TO
INT BORDER STATION - DAY

The light has changed to morning A second empty bucket
joins the first

MILAR mouth bloodied belly impossibly swollen continues
eating Gideon stops him

GIDEON
Hes had enough

VALENTINE
Hes not done This should finish
him off

GIDEON
(shaking his head)
Thats what he wants Youd be
doing him a favor Mr Valentine

Gideon looks into Milars dead eyes with understanding

GIDEON
What is it they say Milar In
the world there are only two
tragedies One is not getting what
one wants and the other is

MILAR
(numbly completing the
quote)
getting it

GIDEON
I told you Milar You cant trust
any land Trust the line
(to Valentine)
The far bank has done our work for
us Take him back
Valentine goes to protest but Gideon cuts him off

GIDEON
Hes more use to us this way

GUARDS drag Milars body out of the cell
INT EXT BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT

The BORDER PATROL truck pulls up outside the boarding house
on River Road MILARs body is carried by GUARDS all the way
into his room GIDEON taking some delight from the theatrical
display They prop Milar up on a chair Gideon turns

Milars head forcing him to directly face the river

YAEGER VERA and the OTHERS watch crestfallen When the
guards depart they go to him preparing to tend to his
injuries They talk over each other

EMMETT
-- You know what you are you are a
deportee They can never take
that away from you

GATES
-- Is it as beautiful as TV Dont
tell me It is

OTTO
-- Even Gideons impressed -- he
didnt kill you

LEON
-- Why didnt he kill you

Yaeger approaches with HECTOR in his arms

YAEGER
-- Look at the boy Look at him

VERA
-- Hector got his color back

HECTOR
I breathed in the wrong piece of
air

They laugh However even Hectors recovery doesnt appear
to console Milar They sense something odd in his demeanor
Van tries to lift Milars spirits by unveiling MILARs

portrait for the wall of fame

YAEGER
Im putting your picture up anyway

EVERS
-- Nobody goes you came back
Inspired

YAEGER
He came back for Hector

MILAR
I never came back they caught me
I didnt get out of the district
I never made it to a town

YAEGER
What about the vaccine

MILAR
I stole it from a guards kit

EMMETT
It doesnt matter Youre a
deportee Your bed will never be
empty again Excuse me Vera but
its true

VERA
Lets get you cleaned up

Milar motions them away as they try to tend to him
MILAR
Im alright
(pushing them away more
forcefully)
Im alright

EMMETT
Next time youll make it all the
way

MILAR
No

OTTO
Take more than this --

It appears something has hit Milar harder than any rifle
butt They regard him concerned

MILAR
Go away

They hesitate

MILAR
(more insistent)
Leave

His anger shocks them

YAEGER
You heard him Lets give the man
some time

They reluctantly depart

VERA
(aside to Yaeger)
What happened Yaeger Whats
wrong
YAEGER
You know what happened Vera I
dont even want to say it out loud

Vera nods in sad understanding Yaeger departs Vera returns
to Milar who hasnt moved

VERA
(whispered)
You can still make a life here We
can make a life

MILAR
Were not living Vera Were
waiting to die
(meeting her gaze)
I want you to go with the
foreigner

VERA
(taken aback)
Why
MILAR
Its the only way If you wont do
it for yourself do it for Hector
Vera struggles to take this in

MILAR
Go

Veras eyes well with tears

MILAR
Get out

She finally departs
INT INDUSTRIAL PARK - ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY

MILAR has returned to the metronomic work on the assembly
line the scene sadly reminiscent of earlier times

The only difference is Milar has achieved a dubious celebrity
status or at least infamy Factory owner HELLER making his
rounds with MALDANO pauses at Milars work station

HELLER
So this is the absentee Our
world traveler Milar is it
Seems you and I share a love of
foreign lands

Milar nods meekly in reply

MALDANO
(an aside as he passes)
Kline I cut your pay

MILAR
(nodding emotionless)
Thanks

Milar continues with his work YAEGER EMMETT EVERS GATES
and several OTHERS watch MILAR at his work station

EMMETT
He wont talk about it Who does
he think he is

GATES
I heard he applied for papers --
official travel permit out of the
district

EMMETT
‘Course Gideon turned him down

EVERS
If Gideon can arrange it the river
will be the last thing Milar ever
sees
YAEGER
(cutting off the disloyal
debate)
-- Hell come back just wait and
see

EXT BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT

MILAR sits on his step unable to look at the river He idly
rips out a wild flower from the far bank and crushes it in
his hand HECTOR approaches

HECTOR
You didnt come back for me did
you Milar

Milar only shakes his head in reply

HECTOR
(relieved)
Thats what I told them I dont
know what Id do if you came back
for me

EXT FENCELINE - NIGHT

Life has returned to normal on River Road -- as normal as it
ever was

The teenage sisters GLORIA and VALERIE dance to the
antiquated radio tuned to the station across the border The
MEN drinking weak beer enjoy the free show The girls
father OTTO emerges out of a house and confronts his
daughters

OTTO
Stop dancing to that
(gesturing to the far
bank)
Its their music

The girls ignore their father dancing away with the radio
EVERS
(intervening on the girls’
behalf)
-- More static than music Otto

GATES
-- Leave them alone Otto Guards
dont care Why should you

OTTO
(ignoring the advice)
Turn that off

GLORIA
(protesting)
Its great

OTTO
Its not great its theirs

The commotion rouses YAEGER from inside the Travel Bureau

YAEGER
Whats wrong with Otto

EVERS
His daughters hips are committing
treason again

Otto finally wrests the radio away from his daughters ending
the show

Yaeger wanders to the fenceline GIDEON rides along the
border road -- all is right in his world The border guard
pauses beside Yaeger

GIDEON
(glancing up to Milars
bunk house)
He came back alright Yaeger But
not all the way
YAEGER
(denying the obvious)
You underestimate him Mr Gideon
Hell come back stronger Hes
resting up biding his time
lulling you into a false sense of
security

GIDEON
I admit I feel secure

YAEGER

You shouldnt Men like Milar are
devoted border crossers the lines
on maps offend them It is for men
like Milar that the wire has barbs
and the dogs are starved

(echoing Milars words)
A man like Milar is never stopped
by the border merely delayed

GIDEON
Youre dreaming Yaeger Find
yourself another boy

Gideon rides away
Yaeger gazes wearily up at Milar Vera joins him

VERA
(following Yaegers gaze)
I can put up with a lot Yaeger
But not him like this

YAEGER
Maybe you should go with the
foreigner Hector deserves
something better than this If you
dont like it over there you can
always come back
Vera has no answer to Yaegers infuriating logic
EXT RIVER ROAD - PUMP - DAY
The river has dried to a trickle once again

MILAR carrying water home from the pump at the south end of
River Road stops at an outdoor bookstand He buys a stack
of hardbacks from the BOOKSELLER for kindling

INT BOARDING HOUSE - MILARS ROOM - DAY

MILAR feeds the stove with classic fiction as he begins the
laborious task of boiling his meager ration of water

EXT BOARDING HOUSE - RIVER ROAD - DAY

The tractor-trailer trucks continue to rumble down River Road
towards World Bridge Through the gap between the trucks we
glimpse MILAR sitting on his door step Once again Milar
has his back to the river visible behind him through the

open doors of the house He idly observes the parade of

trucks passing by in front of him MILAR looks utterly
defeated broken

A gust of wind blows dust in his face kicked up by the 18
wheelers on the heavily-trafficked road He coughs out the
dust and spits He gazes at his spittle quickly evaporating

in the dirt He looks down the road -- a heat haze appearing
there -- shimmering like water A thought occurs to him He
rises to his feet a notion gradually taking shape in his

head

EXT BOARDING HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

MILAR wanders over to the rear section to observe the river
more closely little more than a stream The flow of the
river is further impeded by the silt that has built up and

the garbage that litters the riverbed He runs back to the
house

INT BOARDING HOUSE - MILARS ROOM - DAY
MILAR opens his stove fueled with a stack of books He
reaches into the fire and withdraws the large book on top
He examines the barely singed volume -- INTERNATIONAL LAW

EXT BOARDING HOUSE - DUSK

MILAR hurries out of the house with a jug of recently-fetched
water He carefully pours it out onto the street We focus

on the water dribbling down River Road VERA from her
window watches Milar with more than a trace of pity It
seems to be even more evidence that Milar has gone to pieces

EXT BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT

VERA radiant in the new dress she made for herself pauses
outside her house and looks towards Milars house -- the
light is on She noisily kicks over a bottle in an effort to

get his attention The effort fails HECTOR has been
watching her

HECTOR
Why dont you just knock on the
door

Vera shoots Hector a look

HELLERs car pulls up Resigned she begins to walk
unsteadily down the pathway in her high heels

INT BOARDING HOUSE - MILARS ROOM - NIGHT
MILARs book on International Law sits on the table in
front of him He slams the book shut with a sense of

finality

He is just in time to catch a glimpse of Hellers car
disappearing up River Road

EXT RESTAURANT - TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

HELLERs car is parked prominently outside the only 2-star
restaurant in the border town
INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

HELLER and VERA occupy the best table A live band serenades
them and the handful of OTHER COUPLES almost exclusively
OLDER FOREIGN MEN with YOUNGER LOCAL WOMEN also several

BORDER OFFICERS

HELLER
You hardly touched your meal

VERA
(half in jest)
Did you think Id be hungrier

Uncertain if she is joking Heller lets the remark pass

Vera drinks deeply from her glass to give her the courage to
go through with it but the alcohol appears to be having no
effect

HELLER
Im going back soon -- for a visit
Id love to take you with me if
this goes
(searching for the right
words)
where I think its going

VERA
(matter-of-fact)
Your hotel you mean

Heller is once again surprised by her forwardness
In the background an obsequious WAITER holds Hellers bottle
of wine at the ready From behind we see a SECOND WAITER
take the wine bottle and approaches Hellers table

HELLER
You do strike me as a woman looking
to broaden her horizons

The SECOND WAITER pours the last of the wine

HELLER
No reflection on the local product
but I have a bottle of imported
champagne back at my room

VERA is hardly listening staring open-mouthed at MILAR who
has traded places with their original WAITER

VERA
(returning to Heller)
Another time
(glancing to Milar)
I have a sick friend to attend to

She abruptly rises Milar still acting in his capacity as
waiter quickly gets her chair

VERA
I can find my own way home Good
night

Vera exits Milar not far behind The startled Heller looks
around embarrassed by her hasty departure

EXT TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT
A safe distance from the restaurant VERA confronts MILAR

VERA
You want to tell me what youre
doing

Vera takes off her uncomfortable shoes and gazes
questioningly at the beaming Milar

MILAR
Where were you born Vera
VERA
Its not a happy memory

MILAR
You were born at home werent you
-- two doors from where you live
now -- on River Road You all
were

VERA
No need to rub it in

MILAR
Its the answer

VERA
(beginning to be seduced
by his enthusiasm)
Of course it is Whats the
question

INT BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT

Silhouetted in the netting around his bed MILAR and VERA
make love

INT BOARDING HOUSE - MAIN HOUSE - MORNING

YAEGER prepares breakfast with HECTOR He cuts mold off some
stale bread and breaks the rest into a plastic bow with old

milk He adds sugar to disguise the taste They are both

watching foreign Morning TV

VERA returns home carrying her shoes YAEGER draws her
aside out of Hectors earshot

YAEGER
(assuming she spent the
night with Heller)

Went well
VERA
Couldnt be better

YAEGER
So youre going

VERA
We all are

Yaegers head snaps around

VERA
(meeting his gaze)
Milar wants to meet

INT BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT

A long trestle-style table with plain white paper cover has

been set up in the dimly-lit living room along with several
mismatched chairs and boxes The travel group quietly

assembles Some come reluctantly -- EMMETT obviously dragged
along by YAEGER against his better judgement

EMMETT
(to Yaeger as he enters)
-- I dont know what were doing
here Yaeger

YAEGER
-- He deserves the benefit of the
doubt Emmett We owe him that

Otto shrugging off Emmetts principles referring to the
beer on the table

OTTO
Refreshments

VERA greets them nervously offering the generic brand beer

VERA
(referring to the beer)
Help yourselves

When they have and taken a seat MILAR who is visible through
the doorway standing at the fenceline turns back to the
house and enters

YAEGER
-- Good to have you back Milar
Want you to know we completely
understand --

Milar says nothing increasing the anticipation He remains
standing with the look of a man who has experienced a
religious conversion

MILAR
I just wanted to announce
officially Ive given up trying to
cross the border

YAEGER
(quickly trying to cover
for him)
Maybe youve come back too soon
Take some more time --

OTTO
-- Take all the time you need

Milar continues undeterred
MILAR
I want all of you to give it up

too

After a moment of bemused silence Emmett immediately rises
to his feet

EMMETT
Im not staying here for this

Yaeger keeps Emmett in his chair
YAEGER
Hear him out Emmett

EVERS
But Milar you proved it can be
done

MILAR

No I proved it cant Evers

(returning to his theme)
You think we got problems with the
ones keeping us in -- thats
nothing Wait til you meet the
ones keeping us out Even if you
make it over you cant stay cant
go anywhere -- cant even show your
face in public the whole time
looking over your shoulder

LEON
-- Whats new

EMMETT
-- Id take that over this

GATES
-- Privilege just to die there

OTTO
Hes right

MILAR
No you need a history You have
to be one of them You have to
belong

EVERS
What are you saying Milar You
saying were never going

MILAR
(religious fervor

returning to his eyes)
We dont have to go Were already
there Four ways to cross -- over
under around and through We
convinced ourselves thats all
there is But theres another way
-- a fifth way What if I told you
the curse -- being born a hundred
yards the wrong side what if I
told you its a blessing

OTTO
A blessing

EMMETT
-- This is not the Milar I knew

GATES
-- Hes lost it

OTTO
-- Beer or no beer Im not sitting
in the dark for this crap

MILAR
(cutting him off)
Sit down Otto

Otto sits down Milar motions to Vera and Hector

MILAR
Vera Hector
(to the group)
Please raise your glasses

The group tentatively lifts their beers from the table so
that the paper table cloth can be removed by Vera and Hector
Underneath is a carefully hand-drawn MAP of the borderlands

The map runs the length of the table

EMMETT
(unimpressed with the
theatrics)
We dont need a map we can look
out the window

MILAR

No a map is exactly what we do
need A new map Maybe youve
just been staring at it too long
Maybe you just got so used to it
you cant see it anymore

(indicating the features

of the map)
Heres the border -- the river
Heres us

(indicating a row of

houses)
on River Road

(eyes widening)
But what if River Road was the
river

They stare at him with incredulity -- his insane expression
make them too afraid to contradict him Milar nods to Vera
and Hector They reveal a second map The maps are
identical except that instead of following its usual bend

the blue river now flows directly down the road

MILAR
Instead of going down the riverbed
what if the river went down the
road

EMMETT
Itd be River River

Milar shakes his head at Emmett and dumps his book on the
table open at a page dealing with international boundaries

and treaties

MILAR
Ive looked it up Since the river
is the international border this

levee the land we live on most of
you were born on would suddenly be
foreign soil Without so much as
taking one step outside of our

front doors we would effectively

be in another country Well never
get rid of the border but maybe we
can move it

EVERS
(referring to the river)
The ladys lain in her bed for
generations how are you going to
convince her to suddenly get out

MILAR
Most of the works already been
done for us The river already
wants to go down the road Over
the years all those trucks from the
factories theyve been doing us a
favor

LEON
Sure

MILAR
Theyve worn down the road to the
point that its almost lower than
the river

He demonstrates with Ottos beer pouring a puddle on the
table and then lifting the trestle to let it flow down the
map

OTTO
Almost You said almost

MILAR
It will be after tomorrow Thats
when we start repairs on River
Road

GATES
(realizing the implication
of his remark)
You want us to dig a road for those
bastards

EVERS
Its not a road its a river

LEON
In good conscience Milar I could
not contribute to the continued
exploitation of --

EMMETT
Shut up Leon

MILAR

Weve got to do it fast before the
Spring rains If you go by the
records I figure weve got a week
ten days at most I need to know
if youre with me Means giving up
your factory jobs If it doesnt
come off you may not get them
back

(a difficult admission)
When I first came to the border
you said I couldnt cross it
without you -- well you were
right I cant do this alone I
need all of you If we work
together every one of us can go
over

VAN portrait artist for the wall-of-fame blinks at the
prospect of a mass crossing and starts to count his canvases

EVERS
Lets say you can do it say you
can divert the river Whats to
stop the far bank from re-diverting
it

YAEGER
Nothing

All eyes turn to Yaeger conspicuously quiet

YAEGER
Nothing but greed Theres nothing
the far bank loves more than other
peoples land And they dont give
it back too often

The theory silences the group They are almost won over

OTTO
What about Gideon Hed kill us
for leaving this Godforsaken patch
of dirt whats he going to do if
we take some of it with us

Murmurs of agreement from the others Vera can no longer
stay quiet She speaks up to stem the tide

VERA
For Gods sake You all got so
many reasons for doing nothing
Any of you got a reason to do
something Im doing this and so
are the rest of you

Veras remark shames them

EMMETT
A mass break where nobody moves
What do you think Yaeger Is
Milar crazy or isnt her

YAEGER
Sure he is
(meeting Milars gaze)
When do we start Milar

CLOSE UP ON A SHOVEL

and another shovel and another The men of River Road are

working at a furious pace Dozens of pickaxes and shovels

swing through the air in a synchronized frenzy as if all were

arms of one machine MILAR leads the way -- for once working
alongside EMMETT OTTO LEON EVERS GATES VAN and the
OTHERS Following behind the diggers are MEN hauling heavy
rollers to compress the earth

YAEGER lends his talents to the surveying of the road --
testing the gradient at various intervals with a spirit

level A plumb line of string along each curb indicates the
required gradient for the final paved surface VERA and
HECTOR deliver water

The other RESIDENTS of the border town are intrigued by the
frenzy of labor -- some WOMEN perhaps simply enjoying the
sight of the sweat-bathed bare-chested MEN

YAEGER
(to Milar)
You never told us we were digging
it by hand

MILAR

How do you think I got the
contract Couldnt afford to rent
machinery

(a smile)
Think of it this way Yaeger At
least theyre paying us something
When was the last time a crossing
attempt was financed by its
opponents

Yaeger smiles and continues working

EXT GIDEONS GUARD TOWER - DAY
From his guard tower GIDEON observes the road work through
binoculars LIEUTENANT VALENTINE at his side

GIDEON
That look right to you

VALENTINE
(shrugs)
About time they fixed that road

Gideon nods not completely convinced The WORKERS are
having too much of a good time -- men who have never broken a
sweat in their lives And they have a spring in their step

a swagger

GIDEON
Xavier

The local snitch has been hovering in the background

GIDEON
See what you can find out

EXT FACTORY - DAY

The CLERK at the pay window is arguing with LEON who is
finally able to put his politics into practice

CLERK
-- You dont hand in your notice
Leon we fire you

LEON
Fine by me Why make two an hour
Next week Ill be making fifty

CLERK
Where you gonna make that

LEON
(mysteriously)
Right here

YAEGER alerted to the potential breach of security arrives
on the scene and hurriedly ushers Leon out of the factory

YAEGER
Come on Leon
(explaining to Clerk)
Drink

HELLER and MALDANO stand near the PAYROLL ROOM Heller
watches Yaeger escort Leon away

MALDANO
(shrugs)
Plenty more where that came from
Mr Heller

HELLER
Why are they building me a road for
next to nothing

MALDANO
(shrugs)
Finally showing you the respect you
deserve

Heller regards his foreman with contempt
EXT FACTORY - DAY

Curiosity piqued HELLER takes a walk out of the factory
gates He gazes at the feverish work taking place near the
entrance to his assembly plant In the meantime the
tractor-trailer trucks are being diverted around River Road
to World Bridge

Heller notices VERA with the workers He is still smarting
from her recent rebuff His eyes follow her as she goes to
MILAR and gives him a drink of water The simple loving
gesture clearly irritates Heller He idly inspects the
unusually high curbs that have resulted from the digging
YAEGER passes by making his calculations

HELLER
Never worked this hard for me
Yaeger

YAEGER
And I never will

Heller smiles at the retort said in jest he hopes

EMMETT
You dont pay enough Mr Heller

HELLER
I dont see any of you retiring on
what this roads paying you

MILAR
Were looking at the long-term
benefits Mr Heller Smoothing
the path of commerce

HELLER
When did you become a convert to
the free enterprise system

MILAR
If you cant beat em --

The MEN suppress a laugh and return to work Heller
approaches Vera -- he stands inappropriately close

HELLER
Im going back on the weekend
Offers still open Vera

VERA
Thank you Mr Heller But I
think Ill stay right where I am

HELLER
Im disappointed I felt you were
better than that Had some
imagination

VERA
You know what they say Mr
Heller You can take the girl out
of the slum

Vera departs The bewildered Heller re-enters the factory
EXT RIVER ROAD - NIGHT

The work continues through the night with a fresh shift of
WORKERS YAEGER and MILAR review their progress

MILAR
(trying not to glance
towards Gideon in his
guard tower)
You think he knows

YAEGER
Youre the only one who could tell
him None of my members would
breathe a word

VERA
(approaching)
What are you two decorations doing
(taking Milars shovel
from him)
Theyre not for leaning on

She passes the shovel to another WORKER
VERA
You worked two shifts Let

somebody else have some fun

EXT RIVER ROAD - NIGHT
YAEGER and MILAR relax on the side of the road drinking weak
beer and reflecting on recent events Milar glances to the
brace on Yaegers leg

MILAR
(wary about raising the
subject)
Maybe thisll make up for the leg
I know you dont like to talk about
it -- how far did you get

YAEGER
(thinking back)
Any further and I wouldnt be here

EXT FENCELINE - WORLD BRIDGE - DAY - SOMETIME EARLIER

A younger YAEGER works inside the fenceline near the bridge
entrance on clean-up detail

A whistle blasts Upstream a boat full of REFUGEES has been
spotted in the river in blatant violation of the ban on river
traffic The boat occupies the attention of every GUARD

YAEGER (VO)
-- I was working clean-up detail
down on World Bridge when there was
a ruckus upstream Boat from
District 8 asking for asylum --
have to come from an asylum to ask
for it

The younger Yaeger tries the gate in the fence left
unattended in the commotion The gate opens A completely
empty unguarded stretch of bridge lies before him

This is where the visuals and Yaegers commentary part
company

Y AEGER (VO)
I dont know what came over me
Something snapped I busted
through the gate
The gate is already open

Y AEGER (VO)
And ran -- ran like a lunatic

He remains rooted to the spot

Y AEGER (VO)
I was halfway across the bridge
over the line

There is no one on the bridge It remains empty and
inviting

YAEGER (VO)
Thats when it happened

The younger Yaeger remains petrified at the open gate He
flinches at the sound of gunfire upstream

Y AEGER (VO)
-- A shooter I hadnt counted on

This much is true The younger YAEGER picks up a guards gun
left unattended in the panic Yaeger points the rifle at his
foot and pulls the trigger

INT EXT XAVIERS HOUSE - RIVER ROAD - NIGHT

Through the window XAVIER spies YAEGER and MILAR XAVIER
slips out of the house and crosses the road trying to get

within earshot of their conversation Xavier hides behind

one of the hand rollers to eavesdrop

MILAR
Next week youll be all the way
over
(shaking his head)
God when Emmett said River
River
Xavier make the mistake of leaning on the roller causing the
handle to drop with a clang He has no choice but to reveal
himself

YAEGER
(suspicious)
Evening Xavier

XAVIER
Yaeger Milar

YAEGER
(referring to the roller)
-- Thinking of signing up --
Getting some dirt under your nails

XAVIER
Backs playing up

MILAR
Hows your hearing

XAVIER
(nervously departing)
Better be going Have a good
evening

YAEGER
(a thinly disguised
threat)
Youre going the wrong way Xavier
(gesturing in the opposite
direction)
You live that way
(referring to the
direction Xaviers
facing)
Thats the way to the Border
Station

Xavier tries to shrug off the threat He retreats back to
his house on the river side of River Road Yaeger and Milar
watch him all the way

EXT RIVER ROAD - MORNING

FOCUS on MILAR digging halfway down River Road After
several swings of his shovel he realizes that he is digging
alone

A GROUP of WORKERS stand idly around YAEGER EMMETT and VER
A
MILAR approaches

MILAR
Whats wrong

YAEGER
(heading off Milar
drawing him aside)
-- Theres been talk Some of the
new recruits got wind of the break
If a man helps you cant leave him
behind

MILAR
Where do we stand

EMMETT
(consulting a notebook)
One-thirty-eight confirmed
counting family members and close
relatives

Milar looks in the direction of the strike group

YAEGER
We dont have any choice

VERA
Hes right We need every one of
them to finish in time
MILAR
Well they better not be bringing
everything

EMMETT
(confused)
Whats to bring

Yaeger and Emmett go to the LABORERS to tell them the good
news Work resumes on the road

MILAR
(aside to Vera)
I dont want people getting their
hopes up

VERA
Too late

EXT BORDER ROAD - DAY

GIDEON and VALENTINE observe the construction work on River
Road from their patrol along the Border Road XAVIER comes
to the boundary fence on his property

XAVIER
I cant tell you much but its big
(checking over his
shoulder)
All I know is River River

VALENTINE
Code name

XAVIER
Could be

Valentine hands Xavier a small brown envelope and he hastily
departs

EXT RIVER ROAD - DAY
The asphalt is starting to be poured on River Road spread
and rolled by hand

EXT RIVER ROAD - DAWN

The first vehicles christen the new River Road Ominously

it is a fleet of BORDER PATROL vehicles -- leaving their tire
imprints on the fresh bitumen The Napoleonic GIDEON on
horseback leaves hoof-prints

The GUARDS exit the vehicles on masse and commence a surprise
house-to-house search From an angle at sidewalk level we

focus on the boots of the GUARDS forced to step up the extra
high curbs but with apparently no suspicion

INT EXT HOUSES - DAY

The GUARDS ransack the properties attempting to uncover
evidence of a potential border crossing However this
particular dawn raid seems more rigorous and aggressive

The fences backing onto the border are vigorously tested by
GUARDS for holes gaps and weakened foundations

Other GUARDS search for potential tunnel entrances both
inside and outside the houses Car tires are overturned the
trunk of a rusted car hulk inspected the toilet in an
outdoor latrine is ripped from its base a refrigerator is
knocked over spilling its meager contents a stove roughly
pulled from the wall despite the meal cooking on its top

Inside the houses potential border-crossing aids and
equipment are confiscated no matter how innocuous they may
appear -- a length of rope a flashlight a garden fork

For once the RESIDENTS stand by arrogantly -- some suppress a
smile

YAEGER
(to Emmett under his
breath)
Hes fishing -- got no idea what
hes looking for He just ordered
it for something to do

EMMETT
I almost feel sorry for him

INT BOARDING HOUSE - MILARS ROOM - DAWN

The boarding house is the one residence GIDEON enters in
person MILAR and VERA appear to be anticipating his visit

As his GUARDS ransack the house Gideon approaches a stack of
books One catches his eye The top portion of the title is

visible -- How To Escape -- Gideon cannot resist revealing

the rest of the title -- Your Money Worries Gideon knocks
over the stack of books in frustration

GIDEON
I didnt want you leaving without
saying goodbye Milar

MILAR
Would I leave a woman like this
Mr Gideon

GIDEON
A woman like that Id take with
me
(meeting Milars gaze)
If you cross me Milar I will kill
you

MILAR
Dont have to worry about me Mr
Gideon I promise you Im staying
this side of the fence

Milar is telling the truth and Gideon somehow knows it

Gideon exits failing to see Milars copy of INTERNATIONAL
LAW on top of the spilled books
EXT RIVER ROAD - DAWN

His search frustrated GIDEON exits MILARs house and returns
to his horse held for him by a SUBORDINATE Gideon
hesitates at the curb

In the early morning light the border chief gazes down the
stretch of new asphalt towards the bridge Something about
the roadway intrigues him Taking his rifle he empties a
BULLET from the chamber

We focus on Gideons hand as he gently places the bullet on
the road The bullet begins to roll down the slope quickly
picking up speed Outside his house MILAR witnesses
Gideons test of the gradient Gideon knows something is
amiss but before he can solve the puzzle a voice interrupts
him

VALENTINE (O3S)
Got one Mr Gideon

Gideon turns to see Valentine roughly escorting EVERS from
his house -- an inner tube representing the suspected
contraband

GIDEON
(still lost in thought)
The rivers barely wet Lieutenant

VALENTINE
Not forever

GIDEON
Were done here

Valentine hands the inner tube back to Evers and follows
GIDEON HECTOR approaches Gideons horse

HECTOR
You dropped this Mr Gideon

He returns Gideons bullet Gideon rides away
INT GIDEONS GUARD TOWER - DAY

CLOSE UP on the map of the 33rd district of the border
GIDEON pouring over the chart is distractedly tapping it
with his bullet In the background VALENTINE oversees two
GUARDS scanning the river through their binoculars

GIDEON
Double the patrol

VALENTINE
We found nothing

GIDEON
Precisely

Gideon idly tosses the bullet on the chart and wanders to the
towers balcony

INT TRUCK - NIGHT

A battered pick-up truck carrying MILAR VERA HECTOR EMMETT
and YAEGER drives down a deserted road

VERA
I thought it all went up with him

YAEGER
Everybody did thats why they
didnt search so good
(for Milars benefit)
We lost our resident explosives
expert some years ago

EXT WORLD BRIDGE - PLAZA - DAY - SOMETIME EARLIER

A line of fully-laden tractor-trailer trucks waits to enter

the highly policed Inspection Area at World Bridge The
inspection includes SNIFFER DOGS and a GUARD checking the
trucks undersides with an extension mirror
Across a concrete plaza opposite the trucks a man waits at

the curb Apart from his choice of an overcoat on a

sweltering day KENT BOMBER MADISON appears unexceptional
On closer inspection we see that Bombers face bears the

scars of his chosen pastime A large portion of one ear is

missing and one eye is glass However his countenance

suggests a man at peace with himself

YAEGER (VO)
I told Bomber it was too hot that
day He wouldnt listen Not his
fault he probably couldnt hear
He said he had the truck he wanted
With that cargo theyd take him
anywhere he wanted to go

Bomber checks a document with his one remaining arm -- we
observe that he is also missing two fingers

WORLD BRIDGE SHIPPING MANIFEST
Privileged and Confidential

818

ITEM CONTAINER
Microprocessors 4133-1

The container number on the manifest matches the number on
the truck in front of him Bomber opens his coat revealing

a homemade explosives belt around his waist He primes the
explosives and holds a pressure-trigger in his mutilated

hand

We see a tight CLOSE UP of one of the sticks of dynamite
While Bomber isnt perspiring the explosives appear to be

From a distance we observe BOMBER purposefully striding

across the plaza towards his intended hijacking target We

focus on a BORDER GUARD machine gun over his shoulder idly
glancing in Bombers direction We hear the explosion

All that remains of BOMBER is a small crater in the concrete
plaza and a red smudge where he has harmlessly detonated a
safe distance from the container trucks

EXT HOUSE IN A FIELD - NIGHT

The battered pick-up truck pulls up to a house in a field
MILAR VERA HECTOR YAEGER and EMMETT exit the truck

INT BOMBERS HOUSE - NIGHT

A FLOORBOARD is removed to reveal an entire mining truck

buried in the ground beneath the house including the skeletal

remains of the DRIVER still at the wheel The roof of the

trucks rear tray has been ripped away to allow access to

numerous boxes of dynamite STANDARD MINERALS is the logo

YAEGER
For a few sticks he had to steal
an entire truck

INT BOMBERS HOUSE - NIGHT

CLOSE UP on sticks of dynamite joined together like highly
explosive sausage links MILAR uncoils a roll of industrial

plastic piping with a diameter slightly wider than the

dynamite VERA MILAR and YAEGER nervously prepare to thread
the nitro necklace through the plastic pipe HECTOR keeps

watch at a window

EMMETT
(excusing himself to a
safer distance)
Ill keep watch with Hector

YAEGER
Standing over there wont save you
Emmett

MILAR
You could stand a mile away you
wouldnt be safe
Emmett keeps watch out of the window anyway

VERA
I wish Bomber was here

HECTOR
I think a part of him is

He indicates a jar sitting on a table beside him that
contains the skeletal remains of a FINGER

YAEGER
He lost that in a test
(referring to a photograph
of the former tenant
also on the table)
By the time he blew himself up
there wasnt much of him left

From the photo we see BOMBER with his missing eye and arm

MILAR
Lets get on with it

They begin to thread the dynamite into the pipe
EXT RIVER ROAD - LEVEE - DAY

We focus on the rolled coil of plastic pipe braced in the

back of Yaegers battered pick-up truck MILAR VERA

HECTOR EMMETT and YAEGER drive excruciatingly slow past the
Industrial Park to the top of the new road flinching at

every bump in the road Ever so gently the truck pulls to a

stop at the roads end where it meets the side of the levee

and the border fenceline

The truck is backed up to a drain hole at the roads cul de
sac -- a drain hole that disappears under the levee in the
direction of the river

MILAR climbs up a path to the levee where a GUARD is
stationed at the locked gate The guard turns around
machine gun on his hip FRANCO

MILAR
Franco Got to test the drainage --

Franco glances down to the truck backed up to the drain hole
where YAEGER VERA and EMMETT prepare to thread a metal wire
through the hole Franco considers the request

FRANCO
Good idea They say the rains are
on the way Cant have water
laying on your nice new road now
can we

The remark provokes a nervous smile from MILAR Franco
unlocks the gate watching Milar closely the whole time He
unlocks the gate in the second fence to allow Milar onto the
other side of the levee and the exit point of the drain hole

Milar looks anxiously down the mouth of the hole Franco
stands over him keeping a lazy guard with his machine gun
Milar suddenly lurches back startled by a RAT emerging from
the hole flushed out by the metal snake

FRANCO
Jumpy Milar

MILAR
(recovering)
Not too often I stand on this side
of the fence legal Makes a
change not to be dodging your
bullets Franco

Franco smiles half-heartedly

FRANCO
Personally Im sorry you retired
Milar Jobs just not the same
We lost a lot of overtime
The tip of the metal wire finally emerges from the drain
hole Milar breathes hard and grasps the wire He starts to
carefully draw the lethal pipe towards him

EXT RIVER ROAD - LEVEE - DAY

On the other side of the levee EMMETT VERA and YAEGER feed
the head of the pipe through the drain hole flinching with
each bump and jostle

EXT RIVERBANK - DAY

Finally the pipe itself emerges but jams MILAR tentatively
tugs on the pipe Observing MILARs pathetic effort FRANCO
cant resist He leans his machine gun against the levee

grasps the pipe and jerks it clear of the obstruction

EXT RIVER ROAD - LEVEE - DAY

On the other side EMMETT almost drops the pipe in terror
EXT RIVERBANK - DAY

MILAR takes back the pipe from FRANCO

MILAR
(weakly)
Thanks

Franco regards Milar curious at his reaction Milar drags

the pipe across the bank towards the sludge and debris that
clogs what remains of the river -- FRANCO prefers to keep his
boots clean on the drier bank -- he watches Milar with his

gun at his hip

FRANCO
Dont be going too far Milar

MILAR lays the mouth of the pipe at the edge of what remains
of the channel

EXT RIVERBANK - DAY - LATER
Franco escorts Milar back onto the legal side of the fence
Franco scrutinizes the pipe left behind

EXT RIVER ROAD - DAY
LEON is taking painstaking care painting the road markings

EVERS
Leon its going to be underwater
tomorrow

LEON
(ignoring the criticism)
Theres a thing called pride in
your work

EXT RIVER ROAD - DAY

The freshly sealed road almost ready for its official
opening is blocked off at both ends by metal drums

EXT RIVER ROAD - EMMETTS HOUSE - DAY

On the east side of River Road YAEGER and MILAR help EMMETT
show off his house to XAVIER The house and land is somewhat
grander than that of the other properties although nothing is

especially grand on River Road

XAVIER
(switching a light on and
off)
-- So youre proposing a straight
exchange of properties and I would
only have to pay four hundred to
make up the difference

YAEGER
Correct

XAVIER
This place has got to be twice the
size Whats the catch

EMMETT
Lets just say I prefer the view
from your place

XAVIER
River view
(conspiratorial smile)
I understand Got something in
mind Going over the fence Dont
say another word Loose lips

MILAR
We know we can rely on you

Xavier reaches into his shoe and produces the envelope given

to him earlier by the Border Patrol

XAVIER
(carefully counting out
the money)
When can I move in

YAEGER
(pouring a drink to toast
the deal)
Right away

Milar draws Yaeger aside

MILAR
I want you with me tonight
Theres a risk --

YAEGER
-- dont say another word I know
you chose me because Im the best

MILAR
I chose you because youre the
oldest
INT BOARDING HOUSE - VERAS ROOM - DAY

VERA enters the room where her husband ANGELO began his
tunnel She lays a bunch of wild flowers on the concrete
where the tunnel entrance has been sealed

A lock-box sits beside the makeshift memorial It contains
her husbands personal effects including several photographs
and official documents She finds the document she is
looking for and slips it into her dress

She kisses one of the photographs relocks the box and
departs

EXT BOARDING HOUSE - FENCELINE - DUSK

A party is in full swing on the river side of River Road as a
cover for their activities The GUESTS dance and drink
wildly A GUARD on the fenceline calls out to YAEGER

GUARD
Whats the party for Yaeger

YAEGER
Its a celebration party farewell
party and surprise party -- one
things for certain theres going
to be fireworks

GUARD
Better be done by curfew

The Guard resumes his patrol
We observe a strange phenomenon taking place As each new
GUEST arrives an original GUEST slips into one of the

houses

MILAR stands to one side with VERA looking out across the
river as if they have come for the view
MILAR
(glancing to Gideons
tower anxiously)
You know this may not work

VERA

Things not working were used to

(ooking to the far bank)
When I was a girl I sewed dresses
at the fashion park -- end of
Saturdays shift Id try one of
them on -- wear it for a minute or
two Made me smile to think some
woman over the river was going to
be wearing one of my hand-me-downs
A piece of me would be over there

(trying to reassure)
Dont you see Even if it doesnt
work even if were there for five
minutes its something Citizen
for a second -- Id take it So
would the rest of them Worth it
just to see the look on Gideons
face

Their eyes meet Vera takes a folded document out of her
dress

VERA
Youve forgotten something -- the
chance it will work Youre not
from here remember

She stuffs the document in his pocket They kiss YAEGER
feels a raindrop on his hand He approaches Milar

MILAR
(to Vera as he departs
with Yaeger)
See you on the other side

EXT RIVER ROAD - NIGHT
A LATECOMER dashes across the street He appears to have a
number of possessions stuffed up his overcoat A power lead
dangles from under the coat

INT RIVER ROAD - OTTOS HOUSE - NIGHT

Inside the RESIDENTS are packed in like sardines In
violation of Milars edict many carry suitcases and other
keepsakes and memorabilia Some even have pets In
anticipation of the crossing VAN is painting a self-portrait
in a mirror

OTTO is more interested in the miniskirts worn by his teenage
daughters GLORIA and VALERIE The skirts bear the flag of
the Republic on the west bank

GLORIA
Its their flag

VALERIE
Were just being patriotic

OTTO
If youre so patriotic why dont
you wear a bigger flag

A MAN whispers to his very PREGNANT WIFE
MAN
You want that to have the right
passport you keep your legs
crossed
The woman crosses her legs

EXT TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

The normally bustling town square is virtually deserted A
STRAY DOG has the run of the place

INT EXT TOWN BAR - NIGHT
A bar devoid of customers is hurriedly closed by the BAR
OWNER The owner goes to lock the door However realizing
he is unlikely to ever return he drops the bunch of keys

into the lap of a BEGGAR sitting nearby and bustles away

INT EXT TOWN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

In the restaurant factory owner HELLER is one of only two
customers The WAITRESS looks impatiently at the wall clock
and approaches the table

WAITRESS
Were closing early

HELLER
What about the check

WAITRESS
On the house

She takes his plate The MAITRE D opens the front door to
hasten Hellers departure

HELLER
Where is everybody tonight

MAITRE D
Good question

HELLER trudges towards his ostentatious car as the WAITRESS
and MAITRE D run to River Road

EXT LEVEE - SOUTHERN END OF THE RIVER - NIGHT
CLOSE UP on the street sign RIVER ROAD

MILAR approaches the levee at the south end of River Road
the border fenceline above him Metal drums mark off access

to the new road due to be officially opened next day

Milar stoops as if tying his shoelace but instead reaches
into the drain hole to retrieve the fuse wire hidden there
He fastens it to another wire threaded up his pant leg that
leads to a reel of fuse beneath his jacket

By unfurling the fuse wire through his pant leg he is able to
appear to the GUARDS in the towers as if he is out for an
evening stroll

He makes his way to the property at Number 99 River Road
where YAEGER waits in an abandoned car

INT ABANDONED CAR - NIGHT

MILAR joins YAEGER in the front seat and unthreads the fuse
wire from his pant leg

MILAR
You should be okay here

YAEGER
Should be

MILAR
According to the book A yard for
every pound of TNT Give or take

YAEGER
Youre getting all this out of a
book That makes me feel so much
better

Milar starts to fasten the wire to an igniter device with a
twist-handle trigger

MILAR
Dont worry where Im getting it
(handing the igniter to
Yaeger)
And dont be too happy with that
trigger If we fire too soon it
all goes out the window
MILAR
(referring to his
flashlight)
Ill flash you when its time to
go Soon as you fire I fire

YAEGER
(glancing to the patrolman
on the fenceline)
What if theres a goon on the
levee

MILAR

(wry smile)
Im sure hell move when you blast

(afterthought)
Remember with this electric storm
theres a chance G-O-D could set
one or both of these things off on
his own So if my mine goes first
you go

YAEGER
(slightly confused)
Okay --
(meeting Milars gaze)
You sure were ready Milar

MILAR
(echoing Yaeger)
You mean a little more planning
preparation and what is the
third p Yaeger

YAEGER
(regarding his igniter)
Prayer

Milar gives Yaeger a reassuring nod and exits the car
walking towards the north end of the road Another fork of
lightning illuminates the hills in the far distance
accompanied by a clap of thunder Bloated pregnant
raindrops begin to fall
INT GIDEONS GUARD TOWER - NIGHT

GIDEON surveys the border with the other GUARDS The tension
is palpable The only sound is the trickle of water in the

greatly diminished river In the distant mountains there is

an occasional burst of lightning and a roll of thunder

VALENTINE
You feel it

GIDEON
Something

EXT FENCELINE - NIGHT

VERA leads a group of BORDER CROSSERS including HECTOR and
EMMETT through a hole cut in the fencelines and onto the

bank The flagrant violation is immediately spotted by the

SENTRIES prompting the shrill whistle alert to be sounded

The GUARDS focus their tower spotlights on the crossers

However in contrast to other escape attempts they do not
flee They do not even drop to the ground Rather they
continue to walk slowly deliberately even defiantly in a
line towards the river now reduced to a stream Finally the
crossers stop in a line at the waters edge

The east bank guards led by GIDEON and VALENTINE emerge on
the bank behind the crossers and slowly advance towards them

VALENTINE
(shouting orders as they
slowly move in)
Dont move Dont breathe

Disobeying the instruction VERA takes a step forward the
tip of her toes kissed by the river

Valentine opens fire strafing the water inches in front of
her Vera just shrugs

We focus on Veras dress drenched by the dancing water She
calmly even seductively wrings out the water from the hem
of her dress into the river

VALENTINE
I said be statues

The lack of fear and respect infuriates Valentine

VALENTINE
(close now calling out
behind them)
On your knees

The crossers slowly comply

We focus on GIDEON and VALENTINE weighing the situation as
the guards begin to cuff the crossers

VALENTINE
I dont understand -- makes no
sense

GIDEON
If youre trying to escape it
doesnt

Valentine looks at him

VALENTINE
Diversion

GIDEON
Diversion
(mind racing)
What was it Xavier said

VALENTINE
River
GIDEON
(completing the phrase)
River

In the hills in the background lightning strikes

GIDEON
Were on the wrong side of the
fence
(ordering the guards)
Leave them Back to the bank

VALENTINE
What if they try to cross

GIDEON
They already think theyre across

Gideon turns his confused men reluctantly follow torn
between their captives and their orders

The CROSSERS handcuffed on their knees in a line turn
apprehensively as the guards hurry away VERA is
particularly concerned One GUARD remains behind to escort
the illegal crossers back through the fence

EXT LEVEE - NIGHT

MILAR is unfurling his fuse wire from the base of the levee

at the north end of River Road A clank of a gate on top of

the levee startles him BORDER PATROLMAN FRANCO emerges from
the levee onto the roadway

The wire lies exposed on the ground Franco walks directly
towards it and stops Milar is uncertain whether or not to
attack the guard A risky undertaking since Franco could
drop him with a burst from the machine gun he has at his hip
But Francos casual attitude disarms Milar

FRANCO
(matter-of-factly
referring to the wire)
See this is what I was talking
about Milar You notice something
suspicious like this and you know
you ought to call it in

(referring to the radio

clipped onto his uniform)
but since the cut-backs
theres no guarantee your radios
working Walking up and down the
border everyday I wont lie to
you you get to thinking why am I
patrolling this side instead of
that What if somehow I was
transported to the other side
Well hell Id just get a job
patrolling over there Better
money better guns And that
uniform -- matches my eyes

(meeting his gaze)
If I was to wait at your place you
think Id be safe there

MILAR
(numb)
Sure

FRANCO
(departing)
Dont forget to block your ears
Milar

Milar shaken by the near miss stares after Franco who
obviously has an eye on new citizenship himself But Milar
has no time to contemplate this unexpected good fortune He
continues to unfurl the fuse wire -- now with one less guard
to worry about

Milar takes up a position behind a container in the factorys
parking lot He fastens the fuse wire to his igniter Its
raining harder now He takes a look over the levee and up
the dried riverbed -- expecting the flash flood at any
moment
MILAR
(to himself)
Now or never

He flashes his signal to the bottom of the road and waits
There is no blast in reply

INT BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT

The tension in the house is running high Like the others
itis wall to wall humanity The group of CROSSERS has
returned through their hole to the legal side of the fence
including VERA They are taking turns cutting the handcuffs
left on their wrists by the hastily departing Guards
Otherwise the only sound is the rain on the cardboard-thin
roof

VERA
(giving away her anxiety)
Somethings wrong Were late

HECTOR
Maybe the rivers late

VERA
(approaching the door)
Im going to find out whats
happening

However before she can open the door there is a knock on the
outside

Vera tentatively opens the door to FRANCO still carrying his
machine gun The packed house fails to surprise him

Instead he closes the door behind himself and hands his gun
to the startled Hector With his handcuff key Franco

unlocks Veras bracelets

VERA
Wheres Gideon
EXT BORDER ROAD - NIGHT

GIDEON oblivious to the drizzling rain rides his horse

along the border road Alongside is a border car driven by
VALENTINE Through the grille that separates the front seat
from the back we make out YAEGER in handcuffs crestfallen

EXT INDUSTRIAL PARK - LEVEE - NIGHT

The rain comes down harder than ever From his hiding place
behind the container in the Industrial Park MILAR
desperately signals with his flashlight to the bottom of

River Road Still no blast in reply

Milar ducks back behind the container his mind racing He
cant wait any longer Forsaking the plan he takes a
gamble He twists the handle of the igniter and braces
himself for the explosion

To his horror nothing happens No sound but the heavy
spatter of raindrops He checks the connections and tries a
second time Nothing

From his blindside a severed fuse wire appears in front of
his face Holding the wire is CHIEF GIDEON

GIDEON
(referring to the wires)
I think I know the problem Milar

Without a word Gideon relieves Milar of the igniter as the
ever-present LIEUTENANT VALENTINE presses his machine gun
into Milars check

On top of the levee parked just out of range of the

explosives is the border car and Gideons horse -- their
approach masked by the rain Milar spies YAEGER cuffed to a
metal rail in the back of the car

Factory owner HELLER alerted to the border patrol presence
in his lot approaches -- umbrella to keep off the rain
HELLER
Whats going on here Gideon
(disdainful glance to
Milar)
Whats this trespasser doing on my
property

GIDEON
(clearly irritated by
Hellers presence and
lack of respect)
Moving it Mr Heller

HELLER
(looking in horror to the
igniter in Gideons
hands)
Gideon thats not safe Do you
know what that is

Heller backs away to Gideons mild amusement

GIDEON
(glancing to the igniter)
This This is a passport

He casually flips the now impotent igniter to Valentine

VALENTINE
You traitor

Valentine raises the butt of his machine gun to punish Milar
for his attempted treason but Gideon stops him A distant
roar can be heard over the sound of the rain

GIDEON
I believe this will hurt more

VALENTINE
What is it

GIDEON
The river

Gideon drags Milar up the levee some distance away from the
site of the explosives They gaze along the riverbed Under
the lights of the border fence they observe the head of the
wash in the distance -- the beginnings of the flashflood --
flowing towards them Milar lowers his head He has missed
his chance Yaeger observing from the truck knows it too

A bolt of lightning and a crack of thunder arrive
simultaneously -- the bolt striking the shallow channel ahead
of the flood It conveys its electrical charge to the first

shot of Milars dynamite The charge blows followed by
another blast and another

The succession of blasts approach the levee GIDEON
VALENTINE and the other GUARDS dive for cover Only Milar
remains on his feet The explosives culminate in a massive

blast on the levee itself This final blast lights up the

border like day tossing the barbed wire fences aside like

toy scenery

INT BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT

The wind of the blast rocks Milars house and other paper
thin homes along River Road

EXT RIVER LEVEE - NIGHT

The water that continues to fall from the sky is now joined

by a rain of earth The first victim of the granite hail

storm is VALENTINE who makes the mistake of turning his face
to the heavens in time to see the earthen missile that kills

him His point of view turns to black as a jagged boulder

arrives on his face with a devastating force

The nearby factory is also pelted with rock -- the granite
slicing through the steel roof as if through paper HELLER
flattened to the ground protecting his head peeks up in
trepidation as a huge late-arriving boulder obliterates his
prized auto
The blast blows YAEGER from the border car

GIDEON is prostrate on the ground unmoving covering his
head

With rocks still falling perilously around him Milar cannot
stop himself from making his way through the clearing smoke
to inspect his handiwork

It is soon apparent that the explosives have done their job
The levee has vanished Only a channel remains a ditch dug
by the explosives from the river to the road The wash from
the flood is almost at the channel but will the river take

the desired course

The flash flood flows down the dry riverbed and spills into
the mouth of the newly dug trench For a moment the river
appears to hesitate as if the water is weighing its next
move

Milar stands mesmerized by the sight of the apparently
confused water making up its mind Slowly hypnotically
the river gradually deviates from the course it has taken for
generations and flows into the fresh channel The river is
diverting down River Road and rushing towards Milar

Milar breaks out of his trance He remembers his mission

The river is almost upon him flowing down the roadway custom
built for it He must beat the river to the end of the road

to complete the diversion Milar looks to his feet -- the
IGNITER is still held in VALENTINE s lifeless hand Milar
grabs the igniter and runs

YAEGER
Go Milar

Yaegers cry appears to bring the bleeding GIDEON to his
senses Spying the fleeing figure of Milar he gropes for

his rifle Some distance away Yaeger looks to a guards
discarded revolver For once acting without considering the
circumstances Yaeger picks up the gun -- we sense he hasnt
had a gun in his hands since he shot himself
Yaeger fires at the border chief forcing Gideon to take
cover

Gideon returns fire narrowly missing Yaeger By the time
Gideon returns to Milar he is out of range

EXT RIVER ROAD - NIGHT

MILAR runs -- a desperate headlong dash -- down the middle
of the road the last moments of the roads existence He
flashes past the factory gate and its sign proclaiming YOU
ARE HERE He races on the edge of control along his
regular route past familiar houses -- the river grabbing at

his heels threatening to engulf him

Milar flies past Number 5 River Road 79 11 13 1517
19 21 23 25 27 29 31 -- past the boarding house Number

EXT LEVEE - NIGHT

GIDEON on the west side of the levee finds himself cut off
from River Road by the rushing water He grabs for his
horse uninjured in the blast and pursues Milar along the
border road -- the only road left to him

EXT RIVER ROAD - NIGHT

MILAR passes Number 35 River Road 37 39 41 43 45 47
49 51535557 5961 He stumbles as a finger of the
onrushing water wraps around his ankle threatening to trip
him but he recovers and continues to run

RESIDENTS from the west side of the street recovered from
the blast stand outside their homes and gaze in awe at the
Venetian-like canal now flowing past their doorsteps

EXT LEVEE - SOUTH END OF RIVER ROAD - NIGHT

The BORDER GUARDS guarding the fenceline where the first
explosives were discovered look up the street aghast at the
surreal sight of MILAR sprinting towards them pursued by the
rushing river One of the GUARDS raises his machine gun
contemplating firing at Milar but quickly realizes that his
bullets will have no effect on the angry river that follows

The GUARDS desert their posts diving for safety A moment
later Milar and the river arrive at the retaining wall
simultaneously -- Milar body-slammed by the flood into the
barbed wire fence The levee holds firm

The river subsides back on itself and immediately spreads
out looking for a way around the obstacle If the river was
confused before it is now suffering an identity crisis
transforming itself into a lake -- the water quickly rising

to the doorsteps of the River Road houses

Milar getting his bearings still clinging to the igniter
tears himself off the barbs of the wire and plunges into the
rapidly widening river where he knows he will find the
severed fuse wire for the explosives

EXT UNDERWATER - NIGHT

We see MILAR underwater desperately groping for the wire at
the base of the levee

EXT LEVEE - SOUTH END OF RIVER ROAD - NIGHT

MILAR bursts to the surface with the severed fuse He drags
himself through the wrecked fence onto the dry riverbank
extending the fuse wire as far as it will go However he is
still dangerously close to the levee Forsaking his own
safety Milar tears at the fuse with his teeth to expose the
naked wire The levee is buffeted again by the frustrated
river Milar furiously attempts to fasten the wire to the
igniter and prepares to blast the short fuse Suddenly a
spotlight claims him

GIDEON (OS)
Dont move

EXT TOWER - RIVERBANK - NIGHT
MILAR looks up to find the source of the light -- Chief
GIDEON still bloodied standing on his tower rifle trained
on him

GIDEON
Why cross the border when the
border can cross you I cant
deny it has a certain elegance
Milar But Im afraid I cant let
you do that

MILAR

You dont have a choice Mr
Gideon

(staring down the barrel

serenely calm)
You believe in sovereignty the
rule of law the line You have no
jurisdiction here

Gideon looks quizzically to Milar

MILAR
Thats right Mr Gideon Youre
standing on foreign soil

Gideon looks to the diverted river -- taking in the full
significance for the first time Milars words have an awful
ring of truth

By the time Gideon returns to Milar it is too late Milar
takes his chance and twists the handle on the igniter

GIDEON
No

Gideons cry is obliterated by the wrenching blast that blows
the levee apart A boiling torrent of water cascades
through the hole

Milar is directly in the path of the deluge Our final
glimpse of Milar before he is engulfed should be a look of
terror

However Milar has a smile on his face He gives himself up
to the water The river -- the border -- carries Milar away
into the night

EXT RIVER ROAD - NIGHT

A cheer goes up from the RESIDENTS of River Road They hug
and dance in celebration

EVERS
Were there Were there

EMMETT
Were here and there

VERA cannot join the celebration She looks downstream but
there is no sign of Milar A tear spills from her eye

EXT BORDER - DAWN

As dawn breaks we discover the successful redrawing of the
border -- the river roaring along River Road making a
nonsense of the border defenses it now circumvents On both
sides of the river the fences floodlights and sentry towers
that fortified the border only hours earlier now redundantly
stand guard over a dry riverbed that marks the rivers

original course

Even the buoy bearing the flags of the two nations that
used to mark the middle of the river lies awkwardly on dry
ground

Up in his sentry tower GIDEON isolated from his own GUARDS
is paralyzed -- uncertain of what to do next

EXT FAR FENCE - DAY

FOREIGN GUARDS are seen for the first time tentatively
venturing from behind their fence onto the dry exposed
riverbed As Milar predicted they are coming to secure the
extra square mile of territory delivered overnight The
guards are almost indistinguishable from those of the near
bank

They are warily greeted by the RESIDENTS of River Road The
teenagers GLORIA and VALERIE still wearing their miniskirts
bearing the Republic flag stand at their doorway only to be
dragged inside by their father OTTO LEON announces his
allegiance with a more respectable flag -- for once waving it
instead of burning it

Outside his relocated factory HELLER greets the west bank
guards -- his own countrymen -- with a forced geniality

The guards dont appear to share his enthusiasm After a
cursory glance inside the factory one of the guards removes
the OPERATORS LICENSE displayed at the entrance and
crumples it

XAVIER can be seen stranded in his original territory on the
east side of River Road coming to terms with the fact that
his new house is not the bargain hed been led to believe

EXT RIVER ROAD - DAY

For VERA YAEGER GATES EMMETT EVERS and the other River
Road RESIDENTS searching the riverbank it is a bittersweet
celebration Milar is nowhere to be found Yaeger tries to

console Vera

YAEGER
(gazing over the new
border)
The curse was a blessing Vera
just like he said He drew a new
map He changed the world How
many can ever say that

Vera tries to put on a brave face

HECTOR takes a moment to bend down beside the river He
removes the can of foreign soil he wears around his neck and
carefully places it in the water -- he has no more use for
it

As he follows the progress of the can floating downstream
towards the sea he notices three FIGURES approaching from
the far distance -- walking across the now dry riverbed

EXT RIVERBED - DUSK

Two WEST BANK GUARDS escort a figure across what used to be
the river The handcuffed figure between them is the
bedraggled MILAR

The GUARDS approach their COMMANDING OFFICER who is
supervising the sealing of the new border -- unfurling a roll
of razor wire to stem the tide of illegal immigrants

GUARD
Caught him downstream Do we send
him back

The locals -- YAEGER EMMETT GATES and the OTHERS -- are
frozen in anticipation

OFFICER
(regarding Milar)
You dont look like them Where
are you from
(indicating the two new
banks of the river)
here or there

Milar looks to VERA standing with HECTOR She glances to
the pocket of Milars overalls

With his cuffed hands Milar retrieves the sodden document

Answering the question as he hands the certificate to the
officer

MILAR
Here
It is a BIRTH CERTIFICATE belonging to Veras former husband
We focus on an entry on the certificate

PLACE OF BIRTH 33 River Road

The Officer compares it to the battered mailbox outside the
boarding house -- 33 River Road

The Officer shrugs stuffs the certificate back in Milars
pocket and removes the cuffs

Milar takes a last look at the river and goes inside the
house with Vera Hector and the others -- a new citizen of
the west

FADE TO BLACK
