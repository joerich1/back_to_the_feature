A TAXI pulls UP with a SCREECH VANITY

slouches in the backseat Black boots
black skin-tight pants and a mane of
thick black hair presents a beautiful
and imposing figure Her eyes are

large and dark -- her look open and
ripe She knows what shes got and
doesnt make any excuses for it -- but

the fact is shes scared as hell
possessing a vulnerability that
surprises her by its suddenness An
expensive gold chain is fastened on one
boot

She scrounges through her bag -- pulls
out her remaining cash Its drastically
short of what she owes and she knows it
She tosses it onto the front seat

JUMPS from the cab streaks across the
street The CABBIE lets out a YELL and
JUMPS out after her

Lets Get Crazy continues as we

MORRIS DAY stands in the shower steam
whirling about his face Hes 22 years
old matinee-idol sexy with large dark
bedroom eyes He headlines a slick
techno-funk group called THE TIME which
sports gangster suits and wide-brimmed
hats Hes gifted with a wealth of self-
laudatory humor which he uses like a
knife moving through life with a calm
but ruthless grace

Make no mistake Morris is nobodys
fool His seeming out-raceousness his
charm -- every move he makes is for a
calculated effect He knows exactly
what the ladies need and doesnt mind
reminding them should they forget

He breaks into a wide grin Hair
standing up like Don King he wipes off
a hand mirror regards himself
unabashedly as he brushes his teeth

bumper of a yellow 1970 Fleetwood
Cadillac Jerome is solidly built

COMMOTION The CROWD has become
unwieldly -- TRAFFIC is snarled all
around HORNS are BLARING COPS try
desperately to ward off the inevitable
grid lock

Vanity runs against the light moves to
the head of the queue to the
accompaniment of JEERS and CATCALLS
She doesnt budge an inch KNOCKS
rapidly on the glass door catching the
attention of CHICK a burly 65 285
pound bouncer with a white beard and
long flowing hair An ex-Marine
Chicks function is obvious He cracks
the door--

CHICK

VANITY

I have an appointment with the
manager

CHICK
No you dont -- he doesnt see
anybody

Suddenly a FIGHT breaks out at the
INSIDE MONEY WINDOW Chick spins
instantly SLAMS the door -- but Vanity
jams her boot into the narrow space

The door crashes against her instep she
winces in pain --but Chick doesnt
notice Hes already upon the
OFFENDERS heaving them against the
wall

Vanity streaks inside blazes up the
stairway ducks behind a GROUP of
GIRLS

CHICK turns instantly -- the door is
closed -- VANITY gone His eyes dart
up the stairway -- nothing He shrugs

drags the Two Guys off INT CLUB -- UPPER BAR AREA -- NIGHT

VANITY watches as he moves away She
jumps up lunges onto the dance floor
CRASHES into a waitress JILL whose
tray SMASHES to the floor--

JILL
What are you retarded or
something Why dont you look

a cute innocent way A Daisy Mae-type
whose emotions form so quickly she has
trouble sorting them out Right now

JILL
Follow me

And she turns on her heels makes her
way through the club moving into the
vicinity of the stage Vanity follows
her reluctantly casts a look to the
band She spots Prince for the first
time -- stops instantly

His effect on her is instantaneous
Passion surges through her like a tidal
wave His hair face eyes -- it all
conspires to make her weak Its like
meeting someone for the first time but
seeing so much of yourself in them that
their lips eyes mouth -- youre
certain you have touched and the desire
to be with them becomes so strong that
the very act of touching will release
you in a way you never thought
possible

Prince brines Lets Get Crazy to a
rousing blistering end Suddenly the
stage is plunged into darkness The
CROWD goes WILD

Vanity snaps out of it Jill is
tugging at her arm a puzzled look on
her face--

JILL

VANITY
I dont have a phone When

JILL

Jill turn directly into the path of

-- its obvious she has a crush on him
something awful--

JILL
Hi ya Prince -- God I liked
that song its real fun

She fidgets uncontrollably Vanitys

stage

MORRIS and The Time rip into a funk tune
called Jungle Love Their stranglehold
on the audience is instantaneous

Morris struts across the stage like a
panther playing to the audience with a
relish His eyes fastened on Prince --
his pride umistakable

PRINCE watches Morris a moment then
eyes Vanity again The heat between
them is apparent Vanitys heart is
pounding shes not sure what to do
She keeps her eyes on Morris hoping
that a Solution will present itself

PRINCE watches as Jill tacks the card to
a board behind the bar Sizing up the
situation quickly he again glances at
Vanity -- but her eyes are fastened on
Morris Feeling terribly shy and
thinking theres nothing he can do to
divert her attention away from him he
reluctantly heads for the front door
Vanity finally hits upon something to

say turns--

VANITY
I really liked your song
too

But hes gone Her eyes scan the room

frantically -- catches a glimpse of him
leaving She takes a sudden step then
stops paralyzed with indecision Jill
regards ger coldly

MORRIS meanwhile is beside himself

Some gorgeous dark-haired babe eyes
wide as saucers was starlng at him from
the bar Prince has left and this girl
is his He motions to Jerome and they
direct their act in her direction

JILL gazes at Vanity fidgets intensely
suspicious and resentful of her She
glances up and notices Morris look

She seizes upon an idea forces a
friendly smile taps Vanity on the
shoulder--

JILL
Hey

She points to the stage Vanity looks
at Morris and he goes crazy
entertaining her with his own special
blend of showmanship The CROWD loves
it Vanity is held a moment but her
thouchts are elsewhere She finally
comes to a decision pulls away cuts

motorcycle BLAZES past her from the
opposite direction She starts running
shouts--
VANITY

But Prince is too far away the traffic
too coneested for him to hear He whips
down the street disappears around the
corner

Vanity continues running then slows
dejection overcoming her in waves She
looks around -- KIDS are staring at her
passing jokes Embarrassed She moves
to the front door but Chick is there

Exhausted and slighlty tearlul she cuts
across the street heads back to her
apartment EXT PRINCES HOUSE -- NIGHT

Prince WHIPS down the street cuts his
motor coasts up the drive He comes to

a stop against a wooden gate His house
is a nondescript one-family structure
with a wide front porch He lives ina
neat and tidy homogeneous lower middle-
class neighborhood whose occupants are
hard-working type fiercely protective of
their privacy

He climbs the steps to the porch opens
the front door

-his mothers SCREAM is like ice in his
veins Fear trickles into the hollows
of his body like cold water His pain
commands him to move but the impulse
short circuits somewhere at the waist
leaving his legs twitching
uncontrollably Then another SCREAM
from his mother and his fathers voice
now LOUD and FURIOUS--

FATHER (0S)
Listen to me You come home
when I say come home Youve
got no business in the
streets

WHACK His mother SCREAMS -- Prince
BURSTS into the room INT Princes LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Princes MOTHER is at the far side of
the living room CRYING uncontrollable
Shes in her early 40s a dark-haired
faded beauty with large wild anxious
eyes Theres a detectable scent of
liquor in the air and her slurred
speech pins her as the source

His FATHER is in his late 40s a squat
but solidly built black man with a
cherubic face and graceful expressive
hands

Hes upon her now WHACKING at her
horribly trying to get to her face--

FATHER

WHACK Princes head snaps back his
feet lift from the floor his body
CRASHES in a heap by the door

rushes into the bedroom SLAMS the door
His Father stands motionless sullen--

FATHER

Prince opens his Mouth BLOOD gushes
from a gash in his tongue He hoists
himself up slowly using the wall for
support He moves into the kitchen
disappears down the basement steps BASEMENT -- HALLWAYS AND BEDROOM -- NIGHT

A naked LIGHT BULB snaps ON It dangles
like a pendulum casting strange
shadows The basement is partitioned
off into a series of rooms
interconnected by a labyrinthine
coimbination of passages An old washer
and dryer stand in the corner

Prince descends the steps slowly He
comes through a door closes it behind
him He moves down a narrow passageway
enters a small cramped BEDROOM

He closes the door and locks it behind
him MOONLIGHT filters in throuch the
cacement windows The total effect is
like entering a womb a deep dark
chamber of security and safety

Lying heavily onto his bed he sighs
long and deep his eyes piercing the
darkness

He stops suddenly locks eyes with her
feels his knees go weak Her hold on
him is unmistakable She pulls off her
blouse in one fluid motion tugs off her
boots drops her pants to the ground
Shes exquisite takes a step toward
him Passion rings in his veins

Suddenly she turns on her heels moves
purposefully toward the water Hes
shocked realizes that shes about to
go in--

PRINCE
Hey wait a minute Thats--

But she silences him savagely--

VANITY
We made a deal

And before he can react she scampers
along a log DIVES beneath the surface
He cant believe it -- her spirit really
impresses him She breaks the surface
coughing and sputtering hops and jumps
to the shore--

PRINCE
Hold it

VANITY
What

PRINCE

That aint Lake Minnetonka

He tries to keep a straight face jumps
on his motorcvcle STARTS it up His
words take a moment to sink in then--

VANITY
(enraged)

She gathers up her clothes tries
desperately to put them on She slips

and falls -- Prince cant help laughing-
VANITY
Damn you -- Ill kill you
She starts throwing stones He laughs

blasts up the path--

through the air drops expertly onto the
road He fishtails to a slick stop

throwing things trying to get into her
boots--

VANITY

He laughs heartily wants to kid her
rides down the road as if hes leaving
Having his fun he slows turns to go
back

-his smile dissolves instantly

Vanity is in the middleof the road
flagging down a small PICKUP TRUCK She
hops in slams the door The truck
peels out bears down upon him He

Prince and his band (Mark Bobby Matt
Lisa) sit backstage waiting to go on
An air of tension permeates the room
Lisa sits in the corner and fidgets
casts sidelong looks to Prince He sits
apart from the group deathly silent
locked in thought

Wendy walks in and shares a look with
Lisa She goes up to Prince her voice
filled with nervousness--—

WENDY
Hi ya Prince I heard
through the grapevine you had
a new tune written by two
great girls By chance did
you hear it

He stares at her -- if looks could kill
Wendy would be dead--

LISA

under his bike and rolled over
it

Prince grunts turns away -- Wendy is
amazed-—

WENDY

MC (0S)
Ladies and Gentlemen -- please
welcome Prince

The CLUB erupts in CRIES Prince hits
the stage launches into G-spot a
fast high-spirited funk tune that gets
the crowd hopping Vanity watches as
Prince whips the crowd into a frenzy
Morris listens with a complacent grin on
his face his eyes searching out various
members of The Time who are scattered
through-out the club When he connects
with one of them he makes a series of
absurd faces which sends them into
hysterics For Prince is playing music
that The Time is noted for and as far
as Morris is concerned performs better
Not everyone in the club is dancing or
paying attention and this does not
escape his notice

Suddenly G-Spot comes to a rousing
end The CROWD cheers wildly Prince
moves quickly to the piano and launches
into Electric Intercourse a love
ballad which as it progresses becomes
a personal statement for Vanity and
Prince himself
She listens intently her eyes fastened
on him The words have a profound
effect on her -- and the audience
Without being consciously aware of it
theyre moving closer to the stage
searching for their personal fix Prince
surrenders himself to the music totally
releasing from himself all that is
hurtful -- releasing the sincerity and
truthfulness that escapes him in his
daily life We are entering realm
where life and music are inextricably
bound and the impact on the performer
and listener is profound

Hes directing his music toward her and
she receives it gratefully almost
anxiously It fills a void in her hewn
by a life of meaningless promises He
searches her face with his magnificent
eyes and ends the song with a
heartrending cry which connects with the
souls of all present Everyone is
paying attention now

The stage is plunged into darkness The
CROWD goes CRAZY Vanity applauds
vigorously wipes the tears from her
eyes Morris who was more affected by
the performance than hed care to admit
doesnt like what he sees and searches
for a winning line--

MORRIS
He doesnt like girls

Shes equal to the challenge--

VANITY
I know -- he likes women

But Morris can barely suppress a smile
and settles himself comfortably into his
chair -- for he knows what Vanity has
lostat least this round--

MORRIS
Well he dont do too good
with them either

She flashes him a quizzical look -- he
simply smiles INT BACKSTAGE HALLIIAY -- NIGHT

Jubilation time Prince and his Band
move through the hallway briskly past
the outstretched arms of admiring fans
Theres a lot of back-slapping going on
as the Musicians bask in the glow of
well-wishers Prince moves past Billy
Sparks who has an angry look on his
face--

BILLY
Whats this intercourse shit

PRINCE
Hey man -- dont worry about
it

BILLY

Im warning you

But Prince ignores him cuts into the
dressing room-- INT DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT

--then stops suddenly surprised Hes
muzzle to muzzle with a cuddly DOG held
up lovingly by Jill--

JILL
Surprise

OOHS and AAHS by the entire group
Jill hesitates then kisses Princes
cheek compulsively Hes surprised
touched--

PRINCE
Hey -- wait till were

She fidgets her face blushes red
Wendy is studying the dog--

WENDY
Oh my God -- look at this

Everyone looks -- Jill grins like the
Cheshire Cat--
JILL
Notice anything

PRINCE

WENDY
It looks like you

She thrusts the dog into his arms -- the
Band laughs uproariously Jill is
beaming--

JILL
His hair

Prince gazes into the mirror -- and sure
enough the dogs hair has been groomed
to match his He cant help smiling--

PRINCE
Shit

JILL
(softly)
I wanted to cheer you up

PRINCE
Thanks

MATT
Im hungry -- wheres the
food

He grabs the dog a la The Werewolf
starts chomping on its neck The Group
busts up starts fooling around

Prince glances into the mirror -- Vanity
is there He whirls around to the door
-- nothing A huge smile sweeps his
face instead The Band continues
fooling around and Prince joins in with
a relish EXT ALLEYWAY 2 REAR CLUB -- NIGHT

Vanity leans against a brick wall
hiding in the shadows Suddenly
FOOTSTEPS approach Prince appears

VANITY

PRINCE

VANITY

Why do you always think

He averts his eyes -- kick STARTS his
bike--
PRINCE
Lets go
VANITY
(Getting on)
Yeah -- but were not going to

He remains silent snaps the bike into
gear blasts down the ally into the
street PRINCES HOUSE AND STREET -- NIGHT

Prince and Vanity whip down a
residential street As he approaches
his house he slows moves past it
quietly

He makes a deft U-turn crosses his
house again -- seems to be listening
intently
After a moment he cuts down a narrow
path turns up a back alley He rides
to a wooden gate detaches a hidden
lever The wood slats rotate like a
garage door -- Prince coaxes his bike
through

BACKYARD

Vanitys mesmerized They ride down a
narrow sidewalk cut through a garden
and emerge from the back of a garage
He leans his bike against it--

VANITY
That was a grand entrance
Where am I

He silences her with a look moves
quickly across the grass comes to a
window He stands on a pipe looks in-- PRINCES POV -- INT LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

His Mother and Father in the living
room His Mother is sprawled out on the
sofa obviously drunk her dress hiked
along her thighs Her head rests in his
Fathers lap EXT BACKYARD -- NIGHT

Prince hops from the pipe leans coolly
against the house Intrigued Vanity
looks in-- VANITYS POV -- INT LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

The mother and father kissing
tentatively then violently finally
pulling away The Mother seems to be
taunting the Father coaxing him into a
trap He kisses her mouth lustily --
she pulls back snarling-- EXT BACKYARD -- NIGHT
Vanitys scared -- tries to be cool--

VANITY
So -- friends of yours
PRINCE
Yeah -- the freak show

He walks off She jumps off the pipe
follows

SIDE OF HOUSE

as they emerge around the corner
Prince squats by a basement window
adjusts an old coal chute then slides
down it--

VANITY
Hey

PRINCE (0S)
Cmon

She hesitates a moment then slides down
too INT BASEMENT PRINCES HO -- NIGHT

He turns on a LIGHT disappears into an
ADJOINING ROOM Vanity looks around
amazed She stands in a small ANTE-
CHAMBER whose walls are covered with
thicks pads and foam

Colorful MOBILES hang suspended from the
ceilings -- various INSTRUMENTS lie
about a drumset an electric guitar
and a small upright piano A stereo and
cassette player are perched on a shelf
and two speakers are recessed into the
walls The entire room looks hand-
built the wood carefully painted or
stained

She peers through the doorway into the
adjoining room BLUE MOONLIGHT filters
in through the casement windows

Various MURALS are painted on the walls
MOBILES are suspended from the ceiling
A bed sits in the middle of the floor a
vanity table and mirror nearby

She stands idly a mement then moves
around the antechamber Various
KNICKNACKS catch her attention Small
wind-up TOYS lie about a soldier a
bear banging on a drum a tractor and
car A small MUSIC BOX sits on a shelf
She turns the handle a little TUNE
fills the room

A cassette sits in the player She
snaps it shut hits the play button A
DRUM BEAT fills the room followed by a
WOMANS VOICE seemingly speaking ina
foreign tongue The combination is
hypnotic and sensual -- she finds
herself drawn in

Suddenly Prince grabs her by the waist
lets out a SHRIEK She draws a out
breath jumps--

VANITY
If you think you scared me
you didnt

PRINCE
Oh yeah

He puts his index finger directly in
front of her nose moves it back and
forth hypnotically She follows it
earnestly with her eyes Suddenly he
pulls his hand away stretches it to the
ceiling like an escaping bird They
both smile lock eyes Passion rings in
their veins

The Womans VOICE begins to moan deeply
pleasurably--

VANITY
Whos the lucky girl Sounds
like she was having a good

time

PRINCE
Shes crying -- its
backwards It makes me sad

when I hear it It sorta
sounds like shes laughing
doesnt it

VANITY
So what did you do to her Do
you always treat your women
like that
PRINCE
I dont have anybody right
now

Heat floods into her womb like soft fire-

VANITY
You look pretty

She touches his chest delicately fluffs
up his hair--

VANITY
King Kong
PRINCE
Stop
She hesitates -- but he reaches out

tentatively touches her breast--

VANITY
No

But their mutual desire is too strong
Their lips seek one another out timidly
almost deferentiallythen fervently

DISSOLVE TO INT BEDROOM -- LATER -- NIGHT

Vanity sits at the foot of the bed
Prince stands before her Her dress is
hiked along her thighs her stockings
attached to garters Their hands search
delicately across the contours of their
bodies drawing quick breaths from their
lips They kiss one another ardently
then quickly like sparrows pecking
seed She goes to remove her dress but
Prince stays her with a gesture moving
his hands along her thighs touching
delicately that spot between her legs

A low whispery moan escapes from her
lips

Vanity lies back drawing Prince toward
her His lips move across her mouth
her neck her breasts She moans
softly pulls her dress above her
thighs goes to remove it Once again
he stops her slowly turns her onto her
stomach

She standson her knees her head
resting on a pillow His hands move up
along the back of her thighs past the
garters to her panties He tugs at them
gently then rubs his hand firmly
between her legs She moans suddenly
the shudder moving through her like a
whirlwind

DISSOLVE TO INT BEDROOM -- LATER -- NIGHT

MOONLIGHT glows throuch the casement
windows MOBILES stir gently in the
night breeze

Prince and Vanity are asleep He rests
on his side his hands gently surporting
his face She lies behind him one leg
dangling off the bed one shoe discarded
on the floor

Suddenly a distant MOANQUICK

peacefully Casting a glance upstairs

disappears into the night

PRINCE is resting on his side his eyes

Prince WHIPS down a dirt access road
locked in thought the pain and anger in
his eyes apparent Suddenly a TRAIN
WHISTLE BLASTS just behind him sending
a shot of fear through his guts

He twists backwards in amazement A
FREIGHT TRAIN ROARS around the bend
BLASTING its HORN violently Prince
shudders with fright loses control of
his cycle for an instant He hits a

series of ruts that almost topple him to
the ground

He looks back at the train confused
when another BLAST seems to SOCK him in
the teeth He twists wildly to the side
of the road kicking up dirt and debris
lurching him into the handlebars
violently

The TRAIN ROARS abreast of him Prince
snaps an angry look at the engineer
The Guy coolly gives him the finger and
BLASTS the HORN violently

Prince becomes enraged He snaps a look
to the speedometer 65 mph He snaps a
look to the Engineer -- the Guy sends
him another obscene gesture and BLASTS
his HORN

Prince grits his teeth twists the
throttle full He lurches forward in an
instant blazing in front of the train
The Engineer BLASTS the HORN
mercilessly and throws on the coals
They blast down the stretch neck to
neck twist round a wide bend

Prince edges in front The Engineer
BLASTS the HORN and moves up Prince
snaps a look to him -- the Guy mouths
the words Fuck You

Prince wants to scream He twists the
throttle snaps a look to the
speedometer 75 mph He RIPS past ruts
and gullies like a madman The TRAIN
moves up They blast around another
bend neck to neck

Suddenly Princes eyes widen with
horror A CAR is parked across the
access road waiting to cross the track
He shoots a look to the Engineer -- the
Guy is laughing hysterically now
BLASTING his HORN wildly mouthing the
words Bye Bye

twists his throttle FULL He blazes
ahead of the train BLASTS up the
embankment SAILS through the air

two

He SCREAMS in bloody terror He hits
the road and fishtails wildly locking
his brakes The WALL comes at him like
a locomotive Hes going to hit it

He twists his throttle violently BLASTS
directly into the path of the train

The Engineer looks on in horror Prince
throws his weight forward and

the train ROARS past him as he
fishtails wildly to a stop

LIGHTS up ahead GAWKERS are already crowding around

He moves through the TRAFFIC slowly
glides past a POLICE CAR and a small
CROWD A CAR has run onto the sidewalk

practically smashing it into the gate
His eyes are burning with anger He
flies up the steps three at a time cuts
across the porch bursts throuch the
front door and-- INT PRINCES POME -- NIGHT

-- stalks through the living room eyes
blazing--

PRINCE
Where the fuck are you

He spins like a top streaks down the
hallway throws open several doors
violently--

PRINCE
Where are you

He cuts into the kitchen raging--

PRINCE
Answer me you fucker

He twists around frustrated exhaustion
anger and pain competing for the same
space Suddenly he stops listens
intently a moment We HEAR it now -- a
PIANO Someones PLAYING A PIANO
Prince throws a look at the basement
door -- its ajar INT BASEMENT PRINCES HOUSE -- NIGHT

A naked LIGHT BULB snaps ON Prince
hesitates a moment descends the steps
pauses at the door The MUSIC wafts
delicately in the night breeze He
moves down the halllway uncertainly but
steadily the MUSIC growing drawing him
in
He stops peers into the antechamber
His Father is at the piano his back to
him Hes perched on the broken stool
playing with all hes got

Prince moves slowly into the room his
nees weakening his anger flowing from
him with every step he takes Seeing
his Father this way he doesnt know if
he should laugh or cry He sits down
silently behind him listens as his
Father plays

The SONG ends His Father sits a
moment stretching his hands idly along
the keys Feeling a presence in the
room he spins around and jumps slightly
at seeing his son He fixes him with a
threatening look then shrugs hunches
over the keys--

PRINCE
Is that yours

FATHER
Course its mine Who elses

PRINCE
Id like to see them You got
them written down somewhere

FATHER
No man -- I dont write them
down -- dont need to Thats
the big difference between you
and me

PRINCE
Thought you werent going to
play no more

His Father looks at him sullenly then
looks down stares at the keys
Princes eyes well with tears--

PRINCE
I saw Mom up the street She
looked pretty bad Any idea
how she got that way
His Father bites his his lip rubs a
hand over his face stares at the keys
His voice comes with difficulty--

PRINCE
Yeah

FATHER

PRINCE
(long pause)
I dont know

His Father shares a hurtful look with
him then stares darkly at the floor
below--

FATHER

The CLUB is THROBBING Prince is
onstage stripped to the waist SWEAT
seeping from his pores in torrents

Hes deep into the pit of Computer
Blue locked into a provocative
obscene graphic with Wendy Shes on her
knees in front of him his crotch moving
directly in front of her lips Shes
made up fiercely looks like Prince
himself The total effect is unnerving
-- Prince is going down on himself

Billy Sparks stands by the bar pretty
upset Jill stands slack-jawed The
KIDS have stopped dancing drinking --
they staring at the displayshaking
their heads confused

The BEAT is SAVAGE Prince is in his
own world living his own private hell
Suddenly the MUSIC crescendos then
winds down like a roller coaster
sweeping everyone along The BEAT
changes radically He turns his back to
the audience and plays EXT

and we suddenly recognize the MUSIC
as his Fathers -- the song he played on
the piano the night before But its
Princes now stamped with his own
signature Hes bent at the waist his
back to the audience alone with his
fathers and his pain

The CROWD fidgetsBilly Sparks fastens
his eyes on Prince angrily

Prince is on-stage deep into the
closing moments of Computer Blue He
paces back and forth frantically still
locked in his own private hell The
Crowds attention has wandered however
and very few remain on the dance floor
finding it too much trouble to keep up
with the changing shifts in the music
Even his band members are edgy casting
quick looks to each other wishing to
get on with more compelling audience-
pleasing sounds

BAR AREA

his reaction that he likes what he sees
He kisses Brenda and Susan saves a
special squeeze for Vanity herself He
escorts the whole group to a table
across the floor Vanity brings up the
rear casts a quick look to Prince
onstage

PRINCE

fastens on her and brings Computer
Blue to a rousing end The Crowd
applauds but its more out of respect
than eagerness He doesnt seem to
notice though or care He confers
quickly with his group then moves
center-stage The Band Members trade
frustrated looks with each other -- its
obvious that they have some trouble with
the next song

Prince presses his lips to the mike and
the MUSIC starts He begins SINGING
Darling Nicky--
PRINCE
I knew a girl named Nicky

sex fiend
I met her in a hotel lobby
masturbating in magazines
She said Howd you like to
waste some time
And I could not resist
When I saw little Nicky grind

form tonight

They all look toward the stage--

PRINCE
is fastened on Vanity and its apparent
to all He launches into the next verse-

PRINCE
She took me to her castle
And I could not believe my
eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could
buy
She said
Sign your name on the dotted
line
The lights went out
And Nicky started to grind

VANITY
flushes with embarrassment Billy and
Morris notice this and glare at Prince

PRINCE
looks dead-center at them and then to
Vanily--

PRINCE
I woke up the next morning
Nicky wasnt there
I looked all ovr all I found
Was a phone number on the
stairs
It said thank you for a funky
time

She holds the flask to her lips
defiantly then goes to drink

He lashes out suddenly SMASHES it from
her grip She SCREAMS wildly SLAPS him
hard across the face He stands shocked
a moment his rage surging within him
smashing through every safety valve hes
acquired in his life He BACKHANDS her
savagely across the jaw

She hits the ground like a rag doll He
looks at her curiously bends over her -
- she sucker-punches him with everything
shes got He SCREAMS in rage and grabs
her hands as they flail about his face
He squeezes her fingers back while the
tears stream down her cheeks and her
mouth forms a silent ow She bares
her teeth angrily and he sucks at her
mouth biting and kissing her in a fever
pitch

She kicks at him violently hot tears
streaming down her cheeks He jams his
leg between hers rubs it firmly against
her bottom She struggles helplessly
against him as he covers her breasts
her stomach her thighs with his lips
Quick breaths escape from her -- her
breathing begins to race

He snaps her panties in two pulls them
from between her legs She spreads
herself as he releases his pants She
squeezes his buttocks pulls him toward
her -- but Prince resists her coldly
regards her with contempt Suddenly he
flips her onto her stomach forces her
to stand painfully on her knees He
rubs his hand between her buttocks then
thrusts into her painfully driving
himself to the very depths of her

but she stifles a cry arches her
back and meets his thrusts fiercely
moving quicker and quicker banging her
buttocks against his thighs again and
again Shes drawing from him now
turning the humiliation around
obtaining all that she needs and
desires Hes powerless -- her thrusts
set the pace She rises Prince still
inside her and tugs on him rapidly
causing him to ejaculate suddenly
drawing from him a sharp and sudden
cry
She moves away draws her coat tightly
about her fixes him with a contemptuous
look--

VANITY

Youre nothing Prince

down youre just like all the
rest

(a beat)

Your whole life youve been
hiding hiding behind your
music But now you dont even
have that because last
nightlast night you used it
to hurt someone someone who
really cares

She runs up the embankment wipes away
her tears faces him--

VANITY
If you put your hands on me

the last person you touch

She pulls off his Mothers earring
throws it at him Tears flowing she
streaks into the HIGHWAY blindly
directly into the path of a SPEEDING CAR-

THE DRIVER
spots her in his HEADLIGHTS SLAMS on
his brakes He SKIDS wildly across the
road comes to a SCREECHING BURNING
stop inches from her thigh

VANITY
shoots a look at Prince her lips
trembling her love for him written
plainly on her face But his eyes flash
defiantly She bites her lip sadly
then snaps a hot look at the Driver--

VANITY

She cuts around the car hops in The
Driver skids off into the night Prince
stands there trembling watches as it
disappears into the distance

COPS Princes father is strapped into
a gurney staring dully at the ceiling
PHOTOGRAPHERS snap pictures as
PARAMEDICS work feverishly over him
IV UNITS are pushed into his veins
An OXYGEN MASK is placed over his nose
and mouth Huge white bandages are
bunched up along the back of his head
His Mother is kneeling by the gurney
crying hysterically grasping his hands
in a white panic TWO COPS support her
Someone is SHOUTING instructions

And the gurney is hoisted up the stairs

following his Mother supported as she
ascends the stairs

Prince sits on a tattered sofa in the
corner his head bowed Cops standing
and kneeling beside him Somebody
finished taking notes closes his pad
One Cop rests a hand on his shoulder
talks to him in soft tones Prince
shakes his head slightly The Cop gives

disperses moves up the stairs The Cop
looks at him sympathetically then
closes the door behind him INT BASEMENT -- NIGHT

PRINCE

sits motionless a long time Moonlight
floods the basement with a foreboding
light A dog BARKS somewhere in the
distance He looks up suddenly his
face agitated his eyes red from tears

PRINCES POV--

CHALK MARKS on the floor outlining the
body of his Father Theres a GUN in
his Fathers hand clearly marked

A train WHISTLE in the distance Hes
staring at the gun He shakes his head
rubs a hand over his face vigorously and
looks up again

the GUN in his Fathers hand He
cant get it out of his mind The
WHISTLE is CLOSER

He lurches to his feet paces back and
forth crazily His Fathers head the
gunthe gunthe

The WHISTLE is LOUDER

He throws himself into the chair buries
his face deeply into his hands and
cries Huge racking sobs spasm through
his body His Father his Mother his

entire life his music his guitar

He looks up suddenly -- the gun in his
Fathers hand

and he stares at it
The WHISTLE is LOUDER

His heart is pounding in his ears He
squeezes them shut looks up

The gun

He bolts to his feet paces back and
forth in a panic The train is HOWLING
A rope in the corner of the room his
face the gun

He sits dully gazes at the rope as if
in a trance The TRAIN is ROARING past
the house its HORN BLASTING The
rope the gun and his body dangling
from the rafters in the night breeze--

PRINCE
(screaming)
Noooooo

He lurches to his feet cuts through the
basement like a madman He grabs a
stick and starts SLASHING things
crazily moving through the room
swinging his stick wildly again and
again

Hes lost to himself now deep in the
pit of an unknown terror expurgating a
horror that has been festering in him
for years He flings his stick at the
wall unends shelves and bureaus
trampling old memories that have lain
dormant for years

Drawer after drawer is flung against the
wall their contents smashing and
scattering about He opens a large
oaken chest and flips over Thick three
inch piles of yellowed paper fall out
He snaps through the rubber bands
holding them together and flings the
paper at the wall again and again

he stops suddenly shocked He SEES
musical notes written down on the paper
his heart pounding in his chest he
searches frantically through the rubble
scattered about him More and more
musical notes sketched ideas simple
melodies entire songs and scores -- all
meticulously recorded on lined yellowed
paper dated for the last 20 years and
signedby his Father Hes shocked to
a standstill Then the full
significance of whats before him hits
him like a sledgehammer He collapses
in agony against the chest tears

flowing down his cheeks INT BASEMENT -- A SERIES OF SHOTS (NIGHT INTO DAY)

Prince lying outstretched on the
basement floor sleeping fitfully
feverishly His body is lathered in
sweat the droplets glisten in the pale
light

ANOTHER ANGLE

Cool gray dawn Hes in a dead sleep
on the floor his arms outstretched his
legs twisted beneath him His Fathers
outline seemingly rests by his side

Just then the basement window begins to
glow with SUNLIGHT It inches slowly
across the floor then sweeps him
majestically bathing him in its warmth
He wakes slowly stretches his limbs
like an opening flower After a moment
he sits up shades his eyes

The basement is littered with debris
The destruction is complete but in the
midst of it lies his Fathers music
The yellow parchment is scattered about
glowing in the sunlight

Something seems to flash across his
mind he stands moves quickly down the
hallway to the antechamber

Suddenly we HEAR a TAPE REWINDING

After a momentMUSIC and we
immediately recognize it as Lisas and
Wendys SONG It plays a moment then
snaps off abruptly He stands locked in
thought then sits behind the piano
hunts for the first few notes of Lisas
and Wendys song

well go home INT DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT

As Prince Jill and the Band sit in dead
silence listening to The Times bluster
off screen Suddenly The Time crosses
the doorway -- Morris does a double-
take sticks his head into the room--
MORRIS
Hows the family Whawhak

The Time busts up drags Morris from the
room Princes group is shocked casts

furtive glances to him -- but he remains
serene then--

MC
(over)
Ladies and gentlemen
please welcome Prince

Applause offscreen Prince stands
abruptly straps on his guitar His
Band Members look at him closely trying
to discern his feelings He gives them
a cursory glance cuts out the door INT CLUB -- NIGHT

Prince hits the stage and the APPLAUSE
grows but it s nothing like the
exuberance that greeted Morris He
moves center-stage and plants himself
there his eyes staring into the
audience

BILLY SPARKS
leans against the bar a smug look on
his face

VANITY
walks slowly up the stairs gazes at
Prince

PRINCE

does not move The APPLAUSE trickles
away He continues to stare in the
audience making no attempt to direct his
Band or start a tune A nervous
TWITTER ripples though the crowd Those
who know about the tragedy feel a
profound embarrassment for him -- but no
one turns away Then his voice comes
clear and mellifluous--

PRINCE
I would like to do a song that
two of my friends wrote
A MURMUR cuts through the Crowd like a
riptide Prince snaps a look to Lisa
and Wendy and confirms that it is indeed
their song They cant believe it
Tears spring to Wendys eyes before she
knows it

Prince smiles at her then gazes at his
entire Band Their eyes fasten on him
in an instant He counts softly and

MUSIC The opening bars of Purple
Rain He turns to to the audience and
SINGS

Its a ballad a poem really a plea for
understanding love and survival Its
a testament a pact if you will between
himself and others

The AUDIENCE is mesmerized all EYES are
upon him -- but Prince doesnt notice
Lips pressed against the mike dark eyes
streaming hes lost to himself now
loosening all thats within him
cleansing himself of his rage hatred
and pain

VANITY

is crying Every moment she has shared
with him is expressed in this song and
the effect on her is unnerving Her
heart leaps to him in a way she never
thought possible But she lets it go
willingly as the words draw her in
seducing her somehow making her
freeas if the music his words all
that he has experienced and understood
is purging what is confused and ugly
within herself leaving her with an
understanding and joy that burns in her
womb like soft fire A smile springs to
her lips as tears continue to flow and
she finds herself moving closer

as the Audience moves closer drawn
somehow to the stage to the person who
SINGS so truly to the person who gives
of himself unselfishly to all that he
feels

Prince begins a long sustained CRY that
cuts though the hearts of all present
The MUSIC builds awsomely and he
continues to sing out emptying himself
of all the remaining pain lying within
The MUSIC crescendos and comes to a
quiet end

Stunned SILENCE A silence so profound
you could hear a pin drop Prince
sighs assumes the worse then cuts
across the stage purposefully Now some
CLAPPING And a WHISTLE from the back
and the SHOUTING And more WHISTLES and
some even SCREAMING And the WHISTLES
and the SHOUTS and the CLAPPING growing
and growing as INT HALLWAY -- NIGHT

Prince cuts from the stage in a frenzy
rushes toward the rear exit The
APPLAUSE is building and building until
its a THUNDER an onrushing ROAR an
avalanche of HYSTERIA that rocks the
club mightily

PRINCE

streaming with tears past the surprised
look of Jill past the FANS past

Hes in the final stages of cleaning the
basement floor The debris has been
swept up shelves righted smashed items
thrown away

He stacks his Fathers music neatly
tears welling in his eyes He places it
in new boxes stands wearily a
fulfilled look on his face Suddenly he
stops -- stares at the awful chalk marks
on the floor his Father lying down
the gun gripped in his hand

from the stage Prince sweeps the
audience with his eyes then fastens on
Vanity earnestly SINGS directly to her

The MUSIC continues as we

CUT TO INT BASEMENT PRINCES HOME -- DAWN
He pulls a HOSE from behind the washer
draws it on to the floor He hesitates

a moment gazes one last time at his
Fathers outline tears welling in his

INT BASEMENT PRINCES HOME -- TWILIGHT
eyes He turns the water on watches as
the dusty yellow chalk gives way
reluctantly mixing with the water
swirling down the drain Calmness
sweeps his face like a passing cloud

Just then SUNLIGHT blazes in through the
casement windows Water droplets
glisten brilliantly in the morning
light He turns the water off goes to
put the hose back -- stops suddenly
surprised

-his Mothers earring lies on the
floor

Hes entranced picks it up stares at
it a moment Everything hes been
through comes rushing at him like a loco
motive The confusion the shouting and
violence the darkness that eclipsed his
parents life -- its all there lying
just below the surface settled into his
heart But now theres a difference --
he knows its there and has discovered
what could happen when it takes control
of your life

So as he stands in the basement on the
clean cellar floor he realizes
thathell just take one thing at a
time and do it right Better than
anybody else He smiles realizes that
in the last few weeks hes never felt
better than he feels right now He
turns quickly flips the earring to the
stairwell

Vanity plucks it from the air Their
eyes lock and they share smiles of pure
joy He picks up his fathers music
and they both head up the stairs
I Would Die For You continues as we--
