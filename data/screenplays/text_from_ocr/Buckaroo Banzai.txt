SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Thank you for coming Before I answer any questions I think Buckaroo
owes us all a few explanations for yesterdays antics

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Mr SecretarySenator Cunningham ladies and gentlementhirty years
ago nearly to this day my mother and father and Sir Alan Motley all
former colleagues of Professor Toichi Hikita at the Texas School of
Mines gave their lives for what was considered at the time an insane

notion the possibility of contacting alien life not on another
planet but on a simultaneous plane of existence within solid
matterlife which before the war Professor Hikita had actually

glimpsed while pioneering a highly primitive gravity catapult with
Doctor Emilio Lizardo

BUCKAROO BANZAI

I dont wanna go get too technical here ladies and gentlemen but Im
talking twister physics Quantum Mechanics Now you see now you
dont This table Im sitting behind It appears to be solid matter
right

Buckaroo demonstrating by picking up his plastic water glass dropping
it splashing water left and right as the container naturally bounces
off the table

BUCKAROO BANZAI

But in point of fact the solid parts of this table the protons
quarks your neutrons and electronsthey comprise only about one
quadrillionth of its total volume

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Which is not a helluva lot to sink your teeth into
BUCKAROO BANZAI

Exactly So the professor here way back in 1937 figured that if
solid matter is mostly empty space a person oughta be able to discover
a to travel inside things like tables And mountains

PROF HIKITA

We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way an alternating
gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its
electroweak forces

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part right
