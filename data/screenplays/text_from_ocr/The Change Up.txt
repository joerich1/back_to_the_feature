OPEN ON PEACEFUL BLACK STILLNESS

Then we hear a baby SCREAM BLOODY MURDER Then a second baby
joins in even more shrill than the first Finally we hear
the worst two words a parent can ever hear

GROGGY WOMANS VOICE (0S)

INT SUBURBAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

DAVE LOCKWOOD 30 bleary-eyed father of three shuffles
through his well-appointed suburban home passing a
grandfather clock reading 345 He stumbles over a TOY
GIRAFFE -- it SQUEAKS and Dave sleepily mumbles

DAVE
Sorry Hank

INT NURSERY-- NIGHT
His eyes half-open Dave changes the diaper of his very

very insane nine month old daughter SARAH who screams and
pitches about her changing table

DAVE

PLEASE DONT--
Honey thats not--
Maybe if you--
She snatches a tin of baby powder and swings it about like a
mace knocking over the diaper caddy the wipes the lotion

and dispersing a cloud of white powder all over the nursery
then

powder

Blinded and SNEEZING Dave manages to stay on point and
change the diaper like Van Damme at the end of Bloodsport

DAVE (CONTD)
Cant-see mustpersevere
He finishes changing Sarah places her back in her crib

picks up Sarahs twin brother PETER from his crib -- which
is good because hes been SLAMMING his head against the

DAVE (CONTD)
Come on buddy weve talked about
the head thing--
Dave places Peter on the changing table and opens his

Its only wet and Dave pleasantly relieved reaches for a
fresh diaper

Only Sarah has knocked the caddy all the way down the
changing table

Holding down Peter with his left hand Dave fully extends
leaning waaay over reaching for the diaper caddy

Its just out of reach he somehow stretches further
Its only when Dave glances back that he realizes that his
head is now perfectly lined up with his sons QUIVERING

DAVE (CONTD)
Oh no

THE BABYS BUTT-HOLE ERUPTS

with mustardy projectile stool blasting Dave in the eyes
nose and open mouth Dave remains frozen excrement dripping
down his face -- but like a true dad he does not let go of
his squirming child

INT HALLWAY -- NIGHT
Dave staggers down the hall his hair white with baby

his face covered in poo and a twin in each arm SCREAMING
into each of his ears
squirming
into

slurp

playing

He soldiers on stoic an unsung hero in his time
INT KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Juggling the twins in his arms Dave wipes his face off with
paper towels and prepares two baby bottles -- nipples
filters defrosted breastmilk -- while the babies take turns
icking him in the balls and SCREAMING

DAVE
Please sweetheart not my--
Honey Daddy needs those--

INT DEN -- NIGHT

Dave sits on his couch and positions the screaming
twins across his lap in an X pattern plunks the bottles
their mouths -- and instantly the twins settle down and

away like perfect little angels
Dave exhales Whew Then he reaches for the remote control
and turns on the TV An old rerun of Magnum PI is

Dave watches exhausted and expressionless

ON SCREEN Tom Selleck resplendent in mustache corduroy
short shorts and Hawaiian shirt teaches a nubile CO-ED in

scandalous bikini how to snorkel in beautiful sun-drenched
Waikiki Theyre laughing and having a blast
Dave watches detached Then his face starts to change

MAGNUM PI

Is this the life you always dreamed

of

Dave shakes his head no despair in his eyes

ON TV the co-ed nods yes and hungrily kisses Magnum
Dave watches on with genuine existential longing and soon

tear falls from his eye And then another
DAVE
Take me with you Magnum P I
Before long Dave is CRYING like a schoolgirl

DAVE (CONTD)
Please take me with you

INT STEEL KUHBACH MCCLOUD -- LAW FIRM -- MORNING

She smiles and breezes back down the hallway Dave stops and
watches her go lust in his eyes
Then he hears TSK-TSK-TSK He looks over at his mean old
secretary GLADYS 71 sitting at her desk

GLADYS
For shame Mr Lockwood For shame

DAVE

about Gladys
Reddening he snatches a huge pile of pink message slips and
hurries towards his office She follows him scolding

GLADYS

DAVE
Yes thank you I almost forgot
about them for like two seconds

INT DAVES OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
Dave enters his modest office his phone is RINGING

GLADYS
The only thing that harlot needs to
put in her mouth is a sandwich

DAVE

He angrily punches SPEAKER on his RINGING phone as he
reties his tie with a more traditional knot

DAVE (CONTD)

Lockwood
A shrill horribly impersonated British accent fills Daves
office -- as well as all of the surrounding offices

VOICE ON PHONE

As Gladys and various CO-WORKERS turn shocked Dave quickly
fumbles for the receiver and takes the call off speaker

other more sensitive people -- are
hurt and they think you need to

his

bong under the futon opens the window and tries to blow
the

pot smoke out of his apartment with quick little PUFFS

reveal his father MITCH SR 60s friendly in a suit
holding a pile of mail

a heroin addict only instead of
dating them they move into your
house for 18 years Theyre
laughing one second and crying the
next and then theyre trying to
kill themselves in your bathroom
for no reason Theyre mean and
selfish and they burn through all
your money and they steal your shit
and they break everything and they
stay up all night and they listen
to really shitty music and the
dirty secret is no one actually
likes kids

MITCH
Oh come on you dont mean that--

DAVE
No Its true Everyone pretends to
like kids because if you dont you
look like a huge dick Its like
Drew Barrymore or jazz No one
actually likes them but if you say

The execs furiously race out of the conference room all of

The lawyers hurry after the clients fruitlessly trying to
coax them back to the table

Mitch frowns oo and tiptoes for the exit until Flemming
Steel III grabs his arm furious

DAVE
But my mind is over here doesnt

changed chicks in three major ways

first access and acceptance of

pornography has commoditized women

and pressured them into becoming

sluttier at far younger ages which

is awesome

Mitch finishes paying and continues through the car wash

MITCH (CONTD)
Second text messaging has de-
stigmatized the booty call Calla
girl at 3 in the morning for sex
and its creepy Text her SUCK
WANG MIDNIGHT and its classy I
have no idea why but again an
awesome development

(MORE )

MITCH (CONTD)
Third Facebook and other social
networking sites have falsely
convinced people -- women included
-- that they are funny
interesting and unique Get used
to listening waaay more than you
used to Chicks are the new dudes
they talk about themselves all the
fucking time now Practice saying
things like you are so different
and no really what Golden Girl
would you be and I love Lady
Gaga too

DAVE

singer or an energy drink
They arrive at the CAR WASH WAITING AREA People sit around

Golden Rule of Dating

DAVE
I know always use an alias

MITCH

What No No my Golden Rule of
Dating is always find the fun
Think of it like this for the next
two hours youre stuck with this
chick Doesnt matter if shes cool
or crazy or if she was born with a
vagina on her forehead -- youre
stuck so make the most of it I
dated this chick named Topaz once
who may or may not have killed her

father Long story short she
looked like 50 miles of bad road
and I wasnt interested but I used
our time together to learn about
incest and the failures of the
American Appellate Court system I
found it hugely informative and
Topaz got caught up in my
enthusiasm and gave me a crying
blowjob on the car-ride home so
everybody won The point is find
the fun for yourself and great
things will follow
Dave looks horrified as they roll up to RICHTERS a chic

Everyone in the room is speechless Mitch opens another
soda

MITCH (CONTD)

JAMIE (CONTD)
Sabrina It was nice to meet you

Barely holding it together Jamie wheels and exits SLAMMING
the door behind her Dave just stands there holy shit

CUT TO
INT DAVES HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Mitch sadly packs childrens snacks and Capri Suns into a
duffel bag in the darkened kitchen hating himself Then

CARA

Mitch turns to see Cara small and fragile in the doorway

CARA (CONTD)

MITCH
Oh angel its nothing Im just

CARA

right for once But no Im still

Mitch zips up his bag full of regret -- and finds Cara
hugging his leg

CARA

He crouches down and looks at her getting choked up

MITCH
Thanks sweetie but your brain is
the size of a radish I am a fuck

know how to do the important stuff

She nods confused He kisses her head and exits emotional

CUT TO
INT BMW STATION WAGON -- NIGHT
The rain still pours down Jamie tears streaking her face

drives home in stop-and-go traffic Then through her side
window we see Dave sprinting alongside her car waving

DAVE
JAMIE
Not seeing him she accelerates forward and Dave disappears
from view until she stops and Dave catches up again
DAVE (CONTD)
JAMIE

Still not seeing him Jamie accelerates onto

THE 101 FREEWAY
where the stop-and-go traffic moves only slightly faster
Jamie continues quietly CRYING to herself Then we see

DAVE RUNNING ALONG THE SHOULDER OF THE 101
in the driving rain waving his hands and yelling

DAVE

JESUS JAMIE LOOK RIGHT

Finally she glances over sees Dave -- and startles
JAMIE

Mitch

DAVE
PLEASE PULL OVER BEFORE I DIE
Jamie stunned pulls onto the shoulder and stops A second
later Dave hops into the car soaking wet and panting

JAMIE
What is the matter with you

DAVE
Look I know I havent been a very
good husband or father recently

JAMIE
What are you talking about--

DAVE
But Im done looking over the fence
for something better Ive seen
whats on the other side and its
great and young and supple
but its not you And the truth is
there will always be another fence
with shinier toys on the other
side but the only way to be happy
is to say fuck the fence and just
appreciate what you have you know
Find the fun with what you got

JAMIE
O-Okay

DAVE
Im so sorry I stopped appreciating
you pumpkin I love you And I
love our weird little kids And I
cant believe I ever thought that
wasnt enough

JAMIE
Whyare you calling me pumpkin
And then he kisses her She resists--

JAMIE (CONTD)
Mitch--
But he holds her firm And soon shes kissing him back
confused and overwhelmed and crying
Its emotional and intense for him too They finally
separate but remain inches apart breathing hard

Jamie stares into his eyes amazed

JAMIE (CONTD)
Dave
Dave nods Jamie squints trying to understand

JAMIE (CONTD)
Buthow
Dave shakes his head I dont know

JAMIE (CONTD)

Sothen Mitch was the one
with Gladys
Dave nods again Jamie looks relieved Then she stops

JAMIE (CONTD)
Wait so who was that hot young
thing back in the apartment

DAVE

So mmmso what do we do now

Dave suddenly remembers the fountain and looks at his watch

DAVE

CUT TO
EXT LOS ANGELES -- NIGHT
As the rain tapers off Jamie rockets through LA running
lights skidding through turns splashing through puddles

INT JAMIES STATION WAGON -- NIGHT

Jamie races through LA at 80 mph Dave sits shotgun and
Mitch sits in the back wide-eyed scared
MITCH

around the corner Tokyo Drift-style in her station wagon

DAVE (0S)

Jamie screeches up to a warehouse labelled LA DEPARTMENT

PARKS she Mitch and Dave pile out of the car and run into

THE IMMENSE WAREHOUSE
where they sprint down the towering aisles past park signs
swingsets jungle gyms -- and finally fountains

DAVE (CONTD)
There
Four WORKMEN pack the FOUNTAIN OF METIS into a large wooden
crate for transport Jamie Mitch and Dave run over to them

MITCH

The workmen stop packing the fountain confused

DAVE

into his wallet and starts pulling out CASH--

MITCH AND DAVE STANDING SIDE BY SIDE AT THE FOUNTAIN
with their pants down around their ankles Dave starts
PEEING Mitch doesnt Dave hisses at him
DAVE

MITCH

PAN OVER to the workmen standing nearby looking at Mitch

Mitch tilts his head back and quietly sings to himself

MITCH
The sun is shining all the time

DAVE
Are you singing Randy Newman--
Then we hear a second stream of PEE hit the fountain

MITCH
Oh thank god

DAVE

The lights in the warehouse flicker Dave and Mitch finish
peeing and slowly zip up exchanging a worried look

DAVE

(waving to workmen)
Thank you Have a pleasant evening

Cut TO

PEACEFUL BLACK STILLNESS
