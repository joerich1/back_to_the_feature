Coming closer becoming clearer Its Charlie and

The DPVs are now attached by a tether to an underwater
bag that is used to move heavy loads through water
The crate is surrounded by our three diver-bandits
Using crowbars they pull apart the plywood The

boxes of tomatoes dump out tomatoes spilling

And now we see what was hidden between the boxes

A large safe

They move like clock-work Half-Ear aims an underwater

John peers inside a horoscope and lines up the three
of the combination lock until the door pops open

As they stare at whats inside they speak into their
headsets heard by all

CHARLIE

JOHN BRIDGER
That for which all virtue is sold
And almost every vice -- gold

binoculars and sees --

The last vestiges of the ship hang above the waterline
disappear

EXT UNDERWATER - A LITTLE LATER

The gold is now stacked and secured on the lifting bag
They attach an underwater parachute to the bag and hook
hose from an air tank into press of a pressure release
which cause the parachute to INFLATE

Looking like a hot-air balloon underwater the whole
floats up about fifteen feet Half-Ear holds onto its
going along for the ride

Then Charlie and John Bridger speed off on the DPVs

are tethered to the inflatable bag As they glide

the road The Humvee brakes to avoid running into it

STELLA
Charlie Croker

CHARLIE
Hi Stella
She steps inside

STELLA
Refresh my memory After you came to
see me and told me what happened to
my father I told you I never wanted
to see you again didnt I

CHARLIE
Yeah You did

STELLA
So Im a little confused

CHARLIE
I found him

At first it seems that Charlies words have no effect
on

her but then he notices that her hands are trembling

CHARLIE
I can tell you where he is

STELLA
I dont want to know

CHARLIE
Are you sure

She doesnt answer

CHARLIE
Hes in Los Angeles

She doesnt respond Doesnt ask him to go on doesnt
ask
him not to So he goes on

CHARLIE
The gold bricks he stole from us
were minted in Singapore and decorated
with the face of a Balinese girl
Ive had my tentacles out and got a
call from a friend of mine and your
fathers Philly Steak

Stella remembers him

STELLA
When I was little he would play poker
at the house and drop quarters under
the table for me to find

CHARLIE
He got word from an LA connection
named Skinny Pete that a gold dealer
has been buying bricks with the
Balinese girl on them three or four
at a time

STELLA
You ever heard the expression cut
to the chase

CHARLIE
I tracked Steve down to an address
in the Hollywood Hills Hes changed
his last name to Frezelli And get
this he had a Worthington 1000
installed in the house before he
even moved in We both know that you
dont install a Worthington 1000
unless you have something precious
to guard

STELLA
Precious or not I dont deal with
ill-gotten goods

CHARLIE
We boosted that gold from a terrorist
group that was about to trade it for
bio-weapons Now that doesnt exactly
make us Robin Hood but maybe in our
own little way we were doing a good
deed Problem is no one in my crew
can handle that safe And I need
someone I can trust

STELLA
And you think thats me Havent you
heard that I work for the other side

CHARLIE
What I heard is that you have your
fathers touch And he was the only
safecracker I knew who could open a
Worthington 1000

STELLA
Im not a safecracker Ima
professional safe and vault
technician

CHARLIE
Youre John Bridgers daughter And
this is our chance to set things
right

That sets her off

STELLA
Our chance Who do you think you are
coming in here Stealing the gold
isnt going to bring my father back
to life

CHARLIE
No it wont

STELLA
Then get out

THE COVER OF CONDE MAST TRAVEL MAGAZINE
And beneath a photo of sunbathers on a glorious beach
read the headline

LIVING THE GOOD LIFE ON THE PINK SANDS OF BERMUDA

And OUR VIEW SLOWLY PUSHES IN CLOSER ON the magazine

CLOSER on the line of sunbathers PANNING ACROSS
faces -- and youd never notice unless you were really
really looking for them is it them CLOSER on
pixels and yes it sure is Charlie and Stella in

chairs living the good life

FADE

THE END
