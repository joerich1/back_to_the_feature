September 1948

INT SHIRLEY’S BEDROOM -- DAY 1

A dank purplish haze hangs over the bed A lit cigarette in
the bedside ashtray

In a nearby chair a DRESS is neatly lain out STOCKINGS hang
over the side Scuffed FLATS tucked waiting

From beneath the mound of blankets a HAND reaches for a pill
bottle on the night stand In a slow expert move the HAND
pops the cap and extracts a single pill

EXT HYMAN-JACKSON HOUSE -- DAY 2

A SPRAWLING VICTORIAN perched on a hill The first floor
obscured by over-grown bushes

The curtain of a second story window is drawn open by a
BESPECTACLED FIGURE It surveys the street below

A SCRAWNY DELIVERY BOY struggles under the load of his
wagon He freezes facing the looming Victorian House

He kicks a patch of dirt The blow loosens a few stones He
pockets them

He sees in the second story window a curtain drops The
figure vanishes Was it ever there at all

INT LIVING ROOM -- DAY 3

The late afternoon light pours through the picture window in
dusty streaks

Piles of books Newspapers Dirty coffee mugs Over-flowing
ashtrays

On the battered leather couch lies the portly and bearded
Master of the house

STANLEY HYMAN (50s) defiantly Jewish intellectual and ever
the impresario

His snores rattle the glasses in the liquor cabinet But the
slumbering cats are undisturbed until

BRRRING BRRRING

Stanley swats the doorbell away
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 2

EXT HYMAN PORCH - DAY 3A

Delivery Boy rings the bell Sees the lumbering figure of
Stanley approaching the door The boy flees

INT TRAIN CAR -- DAY 4

The Vermont countryside whizzes by
The cover of THE NEW YORKER

The magazine is held by ROSE NEMSER an old soul
watchful unencumbered by her youthful beauty

A BUNDT CAKE sits on her lap she protects it like the Holy
Grail

She turns the pages of the magazine to

THE LOTTERY by SHIRLEY JACKSON

Beside her fidgets FRED NEMSER waspy beaming with the
affable confidence of someone who has never known an hour of

hardship

Fred reads in the seat next to Rose He takes her hand and
places it on his thigh

Without looking up from her reading Rose runs her hand along
the inside of his thigh Fred puts down his book

Oh his wife is so beautiful He kisses her neck finds her
lips THE OLDER LADY across the aisle coughs her disapproval

Fred places a hand on Rose’s stomach
FRED
(whispering)
Is it alright

Rose nods Fred leads her down the train car

INT TRAIN CAR WASHROOM -- CONTINUOUS 5

Furious FINGERS unbuckle Fred’s belt Diving down his pants

Fred groans and kisses Rose hard pressing her flat against
the tile-lined walls

She bites his lip Then
In a frenzy he spins her around Hitches up her skirt

RIP Underwear on the floor He moans with impatience
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 3
Rose grips the tiny sink Steadying herself His arm circles
around her waist Panting in her ear

FRED
Now Now

She lurches up on the sink She’s ready

ROSE
Mmm

Fred’s face in the mirror awash in his ecstatic climb Rose
sucks in a long moan

Seconds later it’s done He pulls away Tucks in his shirt
and buckles his belt Suddenly embarrassed he rushes out of
the washroom

In the mirror Rose alone A deep exhale Then

Rose FLINCHES wheels around she’s seen something

She surveys the empty bathroom Just her imagination She
picks up the torn underwear and throws them in the trash

INT TRAIN CAR -- DAY 6

Fred leafing through his book Rose brushes by him returning
to her seat They share their secret

Rose holds up the New Yorker

ROSE
They stone her Fred The whole
town Including her own children
stone her

FRED
You reading Shirley’s story again
It’s so creepy

ROSE
What do you think she’1ll be like I
can’t even imagine someone who
would who could think of
something so chilling

FRED
I’m sure she’s perfectly normal
Just like most writers

Rose clutches the Bundt Cake her offering to the unknown He
fumbles for her hand
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 4

Rose looks out the window Farmhouses dot the countryside

EXT DOWNTOWN BENNINGTON -- DAY 7

Fred carries their two suitcases Rose walks on the inside of
the sidewalk carrying the Bundt Cake

FRED
Can you believe it

ROSE
Of course I believe it Professor
Nemser winner of the Landon
English Award for exceptional
dissertation Countless departments
across the country clamoring for
your talent Tenured track position
at an esteemed college Hosting
salons You living a life of the
mind How’s that sound

FRED
Sign me up

She loops her arm in his They are blissful

A KIND OLD LADY smiles at them as they pass on the sidewalk
Then

They pass The BUTCHER SHOP

A PATRON holding TWO SKINNED RABBITS watches her pass with a
steely stare

THE BUTCHER behind the counter assess Rose as if she were
livestock on an auction block

Fred doesn’t notice Rose pulls closer to Fred

They pass the HARDWARE STORE

AN ANCIENT MAN leathery skin hanging loose on his jowls
tracks Rose’s every move Then slowly almost imperceptibly
shakes his head

Rose looks over her shoulder transfixed Was that a warning

A wind kicks up Rose holds down her dress

She stares at a PILE OF ROCKS in an unassuming corner of an
alley Shivers In a flash A GIRL WITH AN EYE-PATCH flits by
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 5

EXT CEMETERY BEHIND HOUSE HYMAN-JACKSON HOUSE -- DAY 8

Rose walks several paces behind Fred who is straining with
the weight of the suitcases He sets them down

Fred points to the THE RUN-DOWN VICTORIAN perched on the top
of the hill

FRED
Almost there

As Rose stares up at it the sun blinds her eyes

She wobbles Sits on a suitcase faint Rose tries to steady
her breath She is suddenly chilled She drops the cake

The house is SWAYING and STRETCHING

She looks down at her feet to break the spell When she looks
up again the house has resumed it’s normal proportions

FRED (CONT’D)
You okay honey

She nods They resume their trek

A curtain in the second story window rustles Was someone
watching them

EXT HYMAN-JACKSON HOUSE -- DAY 9

The front walk is almost entirely obscured by OVERGROWN
BUSHES Fred gives the dilapidated gate a hard shove
revealing

A PARTY IN FULL SWING The front porch is teeming with
faculty and students

Fred and Rose weren’t expecting this

NORMAN a disheveled poet is organizing the FACULTY WIVES in
a seed spitting contest

He holds a handful of cherries

NORMAN
We’re aiming for the gate ladies
Ya got to really get some air
behind it

He spits directly down the front walk PING The pit hits
Rose’s cheek and ricochets to the ground
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 6

NORMAN (CONTD)
Moving target bonus points

Rose holds her hand up in apology and skips off to the side
of the walk running into a DRUNKEN FELLOW

DRUNKEN FELLOW
Hey there sweetie-

ROSE
So sorryexcuse mebeg pardon-

Rose rushes up the front steps oblivious to the dozens of
heads that turn as she goes

At the end of the porch Stanley is holding court with RALPH
African-American novelist

RALPH
I am not having this fight with you
Hyman You know I loaned those
Charlie Parker records to you
Loaned

STANLEY
I think that possession is nine
tenths of the law And I possess a
greater appreciation of Yardbird’s
talent than you do So

His eyes light on Fred pressing through the crowd on the
porch

STANLEY (CONTD)
Welcome to our hallow end of the

earth My boy Welcome to
Bennington

The levitating Stanley nearly knocks Fred over with his bear-
hug and accompanying slap on the back

He smacks both hands against his cheeks eyes twinkling

STANLEY (CONTD)
And who is this lovely dove

Fred ushers Rose forward She extends a gentle hand

ROSE
Rose Nemser You must be Professor

Hyman

Stanley goes in for a kiss one cheek and then the other

SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 7

STANLEY
Stanley Stanley I profess
nothing

He claps his hands getting the guests’ attention
Stanley bows before them with a ringmaster’s bravado

STANLEY (CONTD)
Ladies and Gentleman Hussies and
Cads may I present to you the
Nemsers formerly of Philadelphia
the redoubtable Fred and a varietal
rare indeed his wife Rose

HOOTS AND HOLLERS

Stanley bows again Fred and Rose try to cover their
embarrassment with tight smiles

Stanley takes a swig of a young girl’s drink Then hands it
back He waves at the Nemsers to follow him

STANLEY (CONT’D)
Come come Let’s get you watered
down

INT HYMAN-JACKSON HOUSE -- DAY 10

A cloud of cigarette smoke enshrouds the living room
Women are fanning themselves Men in PITTED ROLLED UP SHIRTS
The walls pulse Bessie Smith’s lament

Nobody loves you when youre down

and out

Rose sees the CARCASSES OF FOUR CHICKENS plucked clean on the
buffet table

Fred sets the suitcases down at the foot of the stairs
Stanley tugs him away

STANLEY
I’1l bring him back in one piece
Rosie
They disappear through the swinging door into the kitchen

Rose stands alone

UPROAR OF LAUGHTER It is coming from the corner of the
living room Rose creeps closer
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 8

Peering between the assembled audience enraptured by an
unseen presence on the couch

Rose glimpses Sensible SCUFFED FLATS STOCKINGS gathering
around a pair of THICK ANKLES A garishly patterned dress
clinging too tightly to amble hips and waist

Strong INK-STAINED HANDS balancing a CIGARETTE between the
second and middle finger while palming a tumbler of SCOTCH

Sloping shoulders A childish LOCKET around her neck
DISHWATER BLOND HAIR pulled back into an anemic ponytail

Rose can now discern the voice -- low intelligent
indomitable

SHIRLEY (0S)
We were out of god-damn coffee
Which is an unforgiveable
barbarity

Rose sees her a mountain of a woman smudged cat-eye glasses
guarding her against the world hiding the intensity of those
steel blue eyes There’s no doubt THIS IS SHIRLEY JACKSON

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
So I picked up a few things And
I’m trudging back up the god-damn
hill It was fucking hot out I’m
cursing my back I’m cursing my
feet I’m cursing all of god-damn
humanity -- when it hit me The
whole thing I sat down at my desk
Two hours later there it is The
most reviled story the New Yorker
ever printed And all I could think
was god-damn I forgot to put the
ice-cream up I’m gonna have to
face that Satanic hill again

HOWLS of LAUGHTER flood the room A tragically DRUNK CAD
cozies up on an arm of the couch

DRUNK CAD
I read it as an anti-Semitic
parable in the tradition of

Isaac Babel

Stanley bursts open the kitchen door it swings dramatically
behind him He is scowling

STANLEY
Calling my wife an Anti-Semite are
we

SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 9

STANLEY (CONTD)
Well to be fair she never hated a
single Jew until she married me

Rim snap A crescendo of laughter Shirley ashes into the
DRUNK CAD’s glass

The guests part a path between Stanley and Shirley

STANLEY (CONTD)
We had a wonderful courtship
didn’t we dear

Picking up her cue

SHIRLEY
Sure thing darling

With a subtle nod a maestro to his orchestra Stanley urges
her to keep it up

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
He asked me out for cheeseburgers
Who could refuse such romance And
next thing I know he’s ripping
apart a story of mine Naturally I
lost my appetite But he won’t let
good food go to waste so he cleans
my plate for me And then he has
the gall to tell me he’s lost his
wallet

Clucks and head shakes

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
That wallet’s been lost for over
twenty years

The room explodes in mirth They love this

STANLEY
Mind you that story was the most
marvelous story I had ever read

A hush falls He means it The dim outlines of a smile cross
Shirley’s face

STANLEY (CONTD)
I knew I was going to marry the
woman who wrote it I was going to
hunt her down and make her marry
me
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 10

SHIRLEY
Apparently I had little say in the
matter

All eyes dart between Shirley and Stanley nobody has a story
like this

STANLEY
The fact that she turned out to be
a shiksa from California well
that’s a little wrinkle my mother
still hasn’t ironed out

Stanley holds up his glass of wine

STANLEY (CONTD)
To our suffering my love

Shirley inspects the contents of her tumbler

SHIRLEY
I’m gonna need more Scotch for that
one

They drink Easy laughter The show is over

Then from the back of the room an unsuspecting GRAD STUDENT
lobs --

GRAD STUDENT
So so Shirley what are you writing
now

The room leans in for her answer Shirley’s eyes dart around
Stanley raises an eyebrow She’s on her own Cornered prey

SHIRLEY
A little novella I’m calling None
of Your God Damn Business How
‘bout yourself

Ohhs from the crowd

GRAD STUDENT
I’m working on my second novel

Shirley struggles to get on her feet Rose can’t take her
eyes off Shirley watches her lift a bottle of Scotch from
the bar

SHIRLEY
You write a novel Write Write
You think pushing around sentences
is work Scrubbing toilets

SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 11

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
Laying bricks That’s actual honest
to god labor You’re fucking around
with words

Stanley shakes martinis he SLIPS AN ICE CUBE down the front
of a FACULTY WIFE’S dress

FACULTY WIFE
Stanley Hyman you behave yourself

STANLEY
And why would anyone want to do
that
The party starts to resume its frothy banter

Shirley picks her way towards the stair

The DRUNKEN CAD stands over the buffet spooning potato salad
directly from the serving bowl into his mouth

TITTERING GIRLS running out the front door
Rose is fixated on the retreating figure of Shirley mounting

the stairs Gripping the banister and lugging herself up
step by elephantine step

Rose rushes after her From the bottom of the stairs-—-

ROSE
Excuse me

Shirley continues her labored assent Rose skips up the
steps catching Shirley on the landing

ROSE (CONT’D)
I’m Rose Rose Nemser

Shirley stares blankly at the gnat circling around her Rose
extends a hand Shirley doesn’t take it

SHIRLEY
Betty Debbie Kathy All the same
to me

Rose is blocking Shirley’s way

ROSE
I’m Freds wife Fred Nemser He’s
helping Professor Hyman this
semester We were invited to stay
with you for a few days until--

Shirley remembers
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 12

SHIRLEY
The newlyweds Ah you’ve
materialized

She pushes past Rose
SHIRLEY (CONTD)
(under her breath)
No one said you were pregnant

Rose blanches How does she know She’s not showing

ROSE
We aren’t telling anyone yet--

Shirley raises a hand she’s uninterested Creak Creak The
stairs moan under her weight Shirley pauses at the top to
catch her breath Lights a cigarette

ROSE (CONTD)
I read your story

Shirley wheels around What’s that chirping Oh the little
wife is still talking Down there on the landing

SHTRLEY
I’ve written several

ROSE
The Lottery It’swell--

Shirley Jackson is standing five feet above her
ROSE (CONTD)
When I read it It made me feel so
thrillingly horrible I really
liked it That’s what I meant to
say

Shirley inhales on her cigarette My my this one might be
different

SHIRLEY
“Thrillingly horrible”

Shirley nods and resumes her retreat The glowing orange
ember of her cigarette receding down the pitch black hallway

12 INT LECTURE HALL -- DAY 12

The spinning vinyl
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 13

What did you bring me
What did you bring me
To keep me from the gallows pole

Lead Belly begs through the scratchy recording Stanley
stands beside the record player Head tossed back Eyes
tightly closed Climbing inside the music

The lecture hall is packed Not an empty seat Girls stand in
the back Girls sit in the aisles They are practically
hanging from the wooden rafters

Rose squeezes past students to find a seat on an empty step
She sees Fred in the front row

Stanley’s thin finger lifts the needle from the record

A hush falls over the hall These students have never heard
the blues Stanley savors the moment A spiritual awakening

Stanley catches a young co-ed’s eye

STANLEY
That was Lead Belly

He cocks an eyebrow at the student Her face immediately
flushed He finds another student a brunette

STANLEY (CONTD)
This is Myth and Folklore

The Brunette sits frozen Oh god he’s looking at her

STANLEY (CONTD)
And I am Professor Stanley Hyman

A rapt audience They hang on his every word

STANLEY (CONTD)
Your fearless leader for the next
twelve weeks as we ascend to the
heights of the gods And stoop to
the very depths of human depravity
I promise you demons devils
ghosts and goblins

A ripple of excitement jolts through the rows of desks

STANLEY (CONTD)
Ladies look no further agony and
ecstasy all there in your
syllabus
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 14
Murmurs he said “ecstasy” The ladies can’t contain
themselves Fluttering eye-lids Swoon-ey smiles

Fred glances around behind him from his perch in the first
row Stanley looks over at Fred and winks

INT LECTURE HALL -- LATER 13

The class is over Clusters of girls mill about the room
waiting to talk to Stanley

Fred gathers his notes He lingers as well eavesdropping on
Stanley’s personal exchange with the students

Rose tries to catch his attention instead she sees him catch
the eye of a STUDENT

She is KATHERINE this girl is trouble She has the easy
confidence that comes with a life of sated appetites

Rose watches as Katherine crosses the hall to Fred
KATHERINE
We’ve heard all about you Professor
Nemser

Now it’s Fred’s turn to blush

FRED
Oh I highly doubt that--

KATHERINE
What’s your sport Rowing

Fred goes mute Stanley clocks it

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
See you on Friday Professor

She bustles away keenly aware of his eyes on her every move

Stanley claps a hand on Fred’s shoulder startling him back
to the present

STANLEY
I see you’re getting familiar with
our lovely student body That
Katherine she’s a very precocious
one

Both men admire the tightness of Katherine’s skirt as she
weaves her way out of the lecture hall
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT

Rose makes her way down the stairs A salmon swimming up-
stream of the students Fred lights up

FRED
Aint he great

ROSE
I wish the Chaucer class I’m
auditing didn’t meet at the same
time

STANLEY
There will be other semesters

Stanley searches around pained to ask what he’s about to
ask

STANLEY (CONTD)
Might I burden you with a favor

FRED
What’s that

Stanley lays it on Rose taking her hands in his

STANLEY
Shirley gets these bouts And just
can’t -- can’t keep up with the

household The shopping
He searches

STANLEY (CONTD)
And our last housekeeper just quit
Bad back or lungs I don’t recall
Maybe gout It would be such a
titantic help if you would Just
tidy up a bit And maybe chip in
with the laundry And the cooking

Rose stares at Fred

ROSE
Oh --

STANLEY
No no Too much Don’t think I
confuse you for a scullery maid
It’s just we are in a bind

ROSE
I’m happy to help around
classes

SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 16

STANLEY
Obviously room and board on us

FRED
Oh no no We couldn’t

STANLEY
Of course I insist Might you stay
just until we’re sorted out Yes

But he doesn’t wait for an answer Kisses Rosie’s hands

STANLEY (CONTD)
How’s your rump roast I love hot
food in hot weather

And with that Stanley is hopping off Leaving Rose and Fred
alone

FRED
We could try it -- just for a week
See if it’s he really seems ina
bind Could be sorta fun

Rose stares into the seat of empty seats

ROSE
Mopping and dusting such a riot

FRED
Or we say no

ROSE
No no One week I can do it for a
week Just be home for dinner I’m
making a roast

FRED
Inspired idea

She steps away Looks back over her shoulder He’s smiling at
her

FRED (CONT’D)

She turns
He bounds up the stairs Kisses her

FRED (CONT’D)
Thanks sport

SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 17

ROSE

FRED

Heat between them

EXT QUAD -- DAY 14

Rose walks through the afternoon sun She spots a group of
girls huddled under a tree

Her eyes fixate on Katherine The leader of the pack
Katherine gives her a fake smile Returns to the girls
whispers something obviously about Rose The girls titter

INT HALLWAY -- AFTERNOON 15

Rose creeps down the hall She stops across from Shirleys
room

The bedroom door is cracked open Lying on a wrestled mound
of sheets mouth open hair-matted is Shirley

Shirley stirs Kicks at the bedding Settles Her nightgown
rides up her thigh exposes her drooping underwear

Rose silently closes the door

INT KITCHEN -- DAY 16

Rose assesses the foulness Mammoth stacks of dirty dishes
The stove top a crime scene Shelves caked with grease
soaked dust Grimy windows Stained curtains The floor a
sticky puddle

She opens the refrigerator Dark fuzzy mold covers the inside
of the crisper drawer Rose gags at the sight

OMITTED 17

INT SHIRLEY’S OFFICE -- DAY 18

The office is empty Rose carries a tray of coffee and pie
She sets it down near the desk Is about to leave when she
sees a flyer

MISSING PERSON PAULA JEAN WELDEN

Riffling through the papers on the desk she finds

BENNINGTON BANNER PAULA JEAN WELDEN MISSING
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 18
She scans the newspaper article Tacked to a nearby bookcase
A MAP OF THE LONG TRAIL
Rose traces her fingers over the map
She reads from an open notebook

“Athletic build Quiet Cafeteria job Why Rich father
Siblings

No Thanksgiving visit home Fight with father Lover”
SLAM A HAND smashes the diary shut

SHIRLEY (0S)
What do you think you’re doing

Rose is face to face with an angered beast
ROSE
I-I-I--thought coffee since you’re
just getting up
Shirley snatches the notebook off the desk

SHTRLEY
You are not allowed in here

Rose recoils and CRASHES into the bookcase She hits her head
-- HARD Knocks over a dish of BLUE PILLS

Rose drops to her hands and knees frantically collecting the
scattered PILLS

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
DON’T TOUCH ANYTHING

Rose scampers around the desk cradling the pills in her
cupped palm

SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
Get out GET OUT

Rose clamors to her feet drops the pills onto the desk and
flies out of the room

Through the wavy glass of the office’s French Doors Shirley
watches Rose run out the front door

Alone Shirley assesses the damage Stacks the notebooks
neatly The newspaper article

She pops a pill Washes it down with coffee
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 19

A girls voice singing flatly

Slack your rope Hangsaman

O slack it for a while

I think I see my true love coming
Coming many a mile

Where is that coming from The room starts to spin Shirley
steadies herself

Then in the corner of her eye Shirley sees A FLASH OF A RED
COAT in the mirror Then a hand comes to perch on her

shoulder
OMITTED 19
INT BUTCHER SHOP -- DAY 20

Rose surveys the meats Glistening crimson in the freezer

A hand on her shoulder causes her to jump The hand belongs
to the BUTCHER

BUTCHER
Something particular for you miss

He stares at her in an unsettling way

ROSE
A rump roast I suppose

He takes his place behind the counter

The entry bell tinkers MRS CLASSEN town gossip saunters
in The butcher papers the roast

BUTCHER
(nods to Mrs Classen)
Be right with you Mrs Classen
(back on Rose)
Put that on an account then miss

Why does she feel like she’s being studied Because she is
ROSE
Oh yes Stanley Hyman Or maybe
it’s Jackson I’m not sure which
The butcher scoffs Mrs Classen leaps in
MRS CLASSEN

SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 20

ROSE

MRS CLASSEN
Not an agreeable household to hired

MRS CLASSEN
You save me any of those sweet

Italian sausages

BUTCHER
You know I did

Off Rose slinking away

INT SODA SHOP -- DAY 21

A SPOON SPEARS A MOUND OF WHIPPED CREAM crowning a
butterscotch sundae

Rose sits alone at the soda counter Savoring every bite of
the ice-cream

The soda jerk HENRY a silver-haired man wearing the
indignity of his paper cap like a champ places a glass of
water in front of her

HENRY
Not one of them college girls

He points to a pack of GIGGLING COLLEGE GIRLS ransacking the
nail polish display

They move like a Greek Chorus They are BRAZEN MATURE
RECKLESS in their dress and attitude

Rose smiles She is not One of them

HENRY (CONTD)
They think after a semester or two
they own this place We have
families buried up in Queen of
Heart that fought in The
Revolutionary War

Henry clucks at the disgrace of it all
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 21

HENRY (CONT’D)
Know what makes that butterscotch
so good

Rose shakes her head “no”

HENRY (CONTD) (contd)
Maple syrup

ROSE
It’s delicious

He’s making Rose feel better despite herself

ROSE (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Is it dangerous to walk around by
yourself here All these girls seem
to travel in herds

HENRY
(offended)
Dangerous This town There’s no
menace in this town You hear me
This is a very friendly friendly
place

ROSE
I just heard about that abducted
girl The college one

Henry stares her in the face

HENRY
Abducted Oh no no no That
wasn’t nobody’s fault but her own
Ask Randy Fisher over at the post
office He’ll tell you Last one to
see her And begged her not to go
straying into the woods Abducted
Yeah that’s what the parents will
have you believe Coming swooping
in Acting like we are a backwater
of rapists and murderers

ROSE
I didn’t mean to offend --

HENRY
There was another girl that went
missing a few years back before
Paula Welden Up there on the pass
They’re calling that part of the
woods the Bennington Triangle
Folks walk in and never walk out
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 22

HENRY (CONT’D)
But that’s just nonsense Don’t
believe a word of it You miss

Rose searches her pockets She’s left her purse--

ROSE
I--uh--left my--

One of the college girls swoops into the stool next to her

PRISSY COLLEGE GIRL
I got you kiddo This one’s on me

ROSE
That’s really nice of--

PRISSY COLLEGE GIRL
Meaning the next one is on you

This girl is flirting with her Overtly Rose is flustered
Doesn’t know how to respond She flees

HENRY

Henry tips his paper cap Grins at her Then watches her
through the front window Once’s she’s out of view his smile
evaporates

Hears voices above

Stanley implores the MOUND OF BLANKETS
STANLEY
Get dressed for dinner darling

From under the covers

SHIRLEY

Stanley peals back the covers Sits on the side of the bed
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT

STANLEY
I really think the two of them are
going to work out Did you see our
kitchen

This irks Shirley
SHIRLEY

A clean house is evidence of mental
inferiority

STANLEY
Well thank god for the simpletons

linens

Shirley dives back under the covers from this post she
reports

SHIRLEY
You hired some spies that it
Those grubby hands all over my
notebooks

Stanley throws back the blanket His patience exhausted

STANLEY
I’m trying to help you Shirl Take
some of the pressure off So you
can get your work done

Shirley hides her face in the pillow

SHIRLEY
I don’t want strangers here I
don’t like them

From hallway Rose listens at the cracked door

STANLEY
Weve already discussed it dear
Fred is going to lighten my class
load So I can be around the house
more Won’t you like that Don’t
you want to get back to your
writing

An overwhelming wave of shame hits her
SHIRLEY
(under her breath)

I’m Trying

Silence
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 24

Stanley pats her back

STANLEY
I know you are darling I know

Shirley wills back hot tears

STANLEY (CONTD)
But you can’t expect me to sit by
and indulge this can you Staying
in bed all day

SHIRLEY
The party was too much It set me
back

STANLEY

You have to get back to your desk
Youre putting an undue amount of
pressure on me Fussing over you

want my work to suffer too do you

SHIRLEY

down and puts on her slippers

SHTRLEY
It’ll be so dull

She lights a cigarette
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 25

STANLEY
I didn’t ask you to behave at the
table
Stanley takes a drag off her cigarette
Rose slips down the hall Out of sight
Stanley kisses Shirley on the forehead

STANLEY (CONTD)

Once he’s gone Shirley flops back down on the bed The
slightest twinkle in her eye

Stifling heat

Stanley and Shirley sit at the head and foot respectively
Fred across from Rose’s empty chair

Rose processes into the dining room with an offering -- A POT
ROAST Stanley hoots and claps

STANLEY
A gorgeous slab of flesh

Passing of dishes Stanley fills their glasses He returns to
his seat and sheds his jacket Sweat beading across his
forehead

STANLEY (CONTD)
Go on my boy shed a layer We
aren’t formal in this house

Fred flashes a quick glance at Rose His jacket stays on

FRED

Fred passes a salad Stanley heaps potatoes onto his plate
An impressive helping

participating in the Native
American ritual of the sweat lodge

Shirley gulps down her first glass of wine
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 26

SHTRLEY
Often

STANLEY
Why yes dear in the middle of our
Vermont winters the thought often
occurs to me

Directing the conversation at Rose

STANLEY (CONTD)
But then when I learned you have to
crawl through a dirt tunnel under
the ground--and sit naked buttocks
to naked buttocks with a dozen
other men while some sha-man stokes
a smokey fire maintaining the
hundred degree heat and pedals some
noxious root tea that inspire
hallucinations well

Stanely on his feet re-filling Shirley’s glass She strokes
his bare forearm He flinches and pulls away She masks the
sting

Rose stares at her plate Fred is uncomfortable

SHIRLEY
(recovering)
The image of your hairy sweaty
tuchus is not dinner table
conversation Why don’t you tell us
what you thought about town Rose
You go snooping around the village

Rose bristles but won’t take the bait

ROSE
It was lovely Talked to some very
friendly folks

SHIRLEY
A bunch of savages The whole lot
Best keep your distance

STANLEY
Darling your paranoia isn’t
becoming Besides you don’t want
to scare our newlyweds

Rose and Fred push food around their plates it’s too hot to
eat

SHIRLEY (CONTD)

By the time that one -- got his
hairy paws on me the kids just
shot out BAM BAM BAM BAM

ROSE
If you don’t mind I’d like to talk
about something else

STANLEY
I fear my love stories of our
copulations might leave the table

ROSE
That’s not what I mean -

STANLEY

Precisely but that one --

babies Calls it Girl or a boy

SHIRLEY
Yes yes you should

Fred clears his and Rose’s half-eaten plates

Shirley feeds the cat at her feet a pat of butter
SHIRLEY

9618 DRAFT

STANLEY
We might want to reconsider our
conversational style in front of
the newlyweds They seem a
sensitive bunch

SHIRLEY
I thought I was being inquisitive

Shirley pulls the cat onto her lap it eats from her plate

Truth

STANLEY
I feel a bit like we’re in the
Scottish play I the Thane of
Cawdor with a murderous prophecy
over my head and you Lady M on the
verge of madness What will happen

SHIRLEY
They’1l bore us like everyone else
does

STANLEY
I don’t know the little wife has a
little pluck to her Don’t you
think

SHIRLEY

Popinjay put me to sleep every
time he opened his mouth

onto her plate

SHIRLEY

STANLEY

SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT

Shirley struggles to confess

SHTRLEY

STANLEY

juicy short story for him to
publish Give him some crumbs Get

it

SHIRLEY
You’re wrong

STANLEY
Darling you haven’t left the house
in two months You can barely pull
on a pair of stockings Ease back
That’s all I’m saying

SHIRLEY
It’s going to be a novel And it’s
going to be brilliant

STANLEY
One thing at a time darling Don’t

Shirley fights back tears He doesn’t believe in her

SHIRLEY
The next time the phone rings
during dinner so help me Stanley
I’m going to deal with it

Rose sets down two heaping plates on the kitchen table She
shouts up the stairs

ROSE
Eggs are ready
(mutters )
Happy to serve you

Stanley charges into the kitchen paper in hand Fred is
steps behind him

FRED
L found that article that links
the tonality of the Druid dirges to
the Appalachian mourning ballads in
the second volume of Francis
Childs collection

STANLEY
That’s grand Just grand

He is nosing around for coffee Rose hands him a mug

ROSE
Milk

Stanley takes it

FRED
It’s what I was cross-referencing
in Chapter Seven of my dissertation
I’m not sure you had the
opportunity to read that yet--

STANLEY
Good god son might I have a cup
of coffee in peace

Stanley snaps open the paper Fred is chastised He pushes
around his eggs then gives up and dumps them in the trash

Rose is elbow deep in dishes Fred gives her a perfunctory
kiss

ROSE
Have a good day dear

She mouths the words “one week”
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 35

Stanley finishes his breakfast egg in his beard crumbs on
his shirt front

He bolts back his coffee standing very close to Rose at the
sink

STANLEY
Keep your eye on the Misses for me

the cheek

ROSE
Of course Professor

STANLEY
Now stop that this instant Mrs
Nemser Stanley Stanley don’t
make me tell you again I don’t

Fred packs up his briefcase and steps out of the kitchen
When they are alone Stanley confides

Deep exhale The hurricane has past Finally quiet

Rosie sits at the table reading over the paper and drinking
her coffee When

THE METALLIC STACCATO OF TYPEWRITER KEYS

INT HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS 27

Rose creeps into the front hallway outside of Shirleys
office

She watches as Shirley in a fugue battles the typewriter
keys Then

Shirley rips the yellow paper out of the typewriter Balls it
up Defeated

Rose stands frozen in the hallway unable to move the house
holding her still

A moment later Shirley is back on the keys typing

Rose released now scans the corners of the hallway with new
eyes

Rose slinks away

INT PLAYROOM -- DAY 28

Rose investigating the house’s secrets cautiously opens the
door to the children’s nursery Cob-webs blanket a rocking
horse A shelf of WELL LOVED DOLLS some missing eyes some
booties

A train track looped in a perpetual figure eight

She opens the closet Shelves upon shelves of children’s
clothes

She runs her finger over the door frame Inspects the height
notches She can almost hear the children’s laughter

In the corner sits an empty bassinet A rocking chair keeping
vigil

Rose sits in the chair stares out the window as the late
morning sun filters through the gossamer curtain

She sees a stack of identical books Boxes and boxes of them
Stanley Hyman’s THE ARMED VISION

Crash
Rose jumps up

Shirley drops a large box onto the kiddy table
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 37

SHIRLEY
Yeah poor Stanley Had to buy back
his books from the publisher He
keeps threatening to write another
Where will we put them

Shirley shoves the box towards Rose

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
Open it

Shirley precariously sits on a kiddy chair

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
There’s more where that came from
Up in the attic But I don’t like
the bats

Rose cautiously reluctantly opens the box It’s filled with
baby clothes Adorable sweaters booties a silver baby
spoon

ROSE
They’re gorgeous But I can’t
These are too nice

Rose folds the clothes back up Shirley takes the silver
spoon

SHIRLEY
My mother the Great Geraldine We
couldn’t afford the hospital bill
for my oldest And what does she
do Sends a fucking silver spoon
and a Christening outfit that costs
more than the water heater

ROSE
I never knew what a lobster fork
was until my first dinner at Fred’s
house

Shirley gives the spoon to Rose
SHIRLEY
Take ‘em Or the rats will be using
them some day for nesting
ROSE
Seems a little early to be
collecting things for the baby

Rose sets the spoon down She doesn’t want to dream

SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 38
SHTRLEY
Follow me
It’s not an invitation it’s a command

INT SHIRLEY’S OFFICE -- DAY 29

Shirley’s hands dance over the spines of dozens of books

SHIRLEY
I know where every single book is
in this house

Shirley hands Rose a pile of books
SHIRLEY (CONTD)
Look for anything with Fertility
Maternity Full Moon in the title
Rose can’t tell if she’s joking She stares at her confused
SHIRLEY (CONTD)
Oh I’m a witch Didn’t anyone tell
you
She keeps piling books into Rose’s arms
SHIRLEY (CONTD)
Healthy happy baby That’s the
spell we need
Shirley stops for a moment considers--
SHIRLEY (CONTD)
Unless you want a spell for the
other thing

Rose sets the books down

ROSE
What No How could you even think-

Shirley back on the hunt

SHIRLEY
Don’t get your hackles up The
house knows things The joys of
motherhood come with a price

Rose wants to ask but can’t what does the house know But
she doesn’t Instead she pulls down a DECK OF TAROT cards
from the shelf

Shirley brightens
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 39
SHIRLEY (CONTD)
Cut them Go on
Rose fumbles with the cards nervous
SHIRLEY (CONTD)
They wont bite Just divide the
deck three times However you
choose Or however they choose
Rose divides the deck three times Shirley sits on a small
chaise Invites Rose to sit across from her A side table
between them

Shirley knocks on the table

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
Place the deck face down

Rose does Shirley precisely peels card after card
impassively placing them into a tarot formation

Shirley studies the cards Flashes of one card over and over
HANGSAMAN -- HANGSAMAN -- HANGSAMAN

Shirley looks up from the cards and sitting on across from
her is

PAULA WELDEN wearing that RED COAT Or rather it’s Rose
who is Paula as seen from Shirley’s imagination

Shirley blanches
Rose returns

ROSE
What did you see

Shirley stares back at the cards
Shirley collects the cards back into a deck
SHIRLEY
Youre going to die someday just
like the rest of us Now leave me
alone to work

Rose gets up Shaken

INT BATHROOM -- NIGHT 30

Shirley soaking neck-deep in the tub Her arm dangles over
the side clutching a cigarette
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 40

The metronomic drip of the tub faucet

The window is open framing the September blue moon She
listens to Stanley’s bright tenor voice climbing up from the
porch Chased by Fred’s trilling laugh

Shirley grips the sides of the tub splashing water and
spilling ash on the tile floor

She slips back down in the tub head under the water

INT DORM ROOM -- NIGHT 31

A nauseating darkness The tossing form of Paula The sheets
are twisted in a heap at the foot of her twin bed

The room is morgue-like seeped in shadows of the moonless
autumn night

Paula’s eyes flutter open Something’s startled her awake

She lays stock still Then cramping pain she clutches her
side Switches on her reading lamp

Blood Blood everywhere Pooling between her thighs
drenching her nightgown She jumps out of bed Wraps a towel
around her waist Limps to the door

INT DORM HALL -- NIGHT 32

Paula peaks out of her door at the empty hallway She keeps a
guiding hand against the wall Short steps The bathroom an
eternity away

She closes her eyes with the pain Tight-rope walks down the
hall

INT BATHROOM -- NIGHT 33

The bathroom door creaks open Paula slips inside Her night
dress stained with the blood of a miscarriage

She strips off the night gown Hurls herself onto the toilet
Shirley sits up in the tub Coaxes her to the water

Paula steps into the tub Sinks down The tub fills with
faint crimson streaks

INT BATHROOM -- NIGHT 34

Shirley’s cheek pressed firmly on the tile floor Where is
she She is naked The room is spinning
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 41

POUNDING ON THE DOOR
No sign of Paula No bloody night dress
Shirley tries to stand Collapses back to the ground

STANLEY (0S)
Shirl You okay in there Shirl

She recognizes the voice How long has she been here She
rolls over the room still spinning

SHTRLEY
Mmm-hmm I’m fine Fine

Stanley tries the door handle Shirley watches it turn in
panic He rattles it Locked Thank god

STANLEY
You sure

SHIRLEY
Be right out

She listens to the footsteps receding down the hall She
props herself back up against the tub

Shirley lights a cigarette Droplets of water run down her
naked body

INT ROSE’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 35

Rose reads in bed Her movements mirroring Paula’s from the
previous scene in Shirley’s imagination

Fred fusses getting into pajamas

FRED

new faculty and all that He hinted
there might be an opening in the
English department next fall

ROSE

Fred stares at her in disbelief

FRED
No-no You are not getting into
that bullshit

ROSE
I’m not into it I’m just -- leave
it be

FRED

She did this Is this some sort of
hex

ROSE
Just leave it be It’s fine It’s
not dark magic if you don’t believe
in it It’s to keep the baby safe

Fred crawls into bed

FRED
You don’t believe in it
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT

A pause

FRED (CONTD)

ideas into your head

ROSE

all She wanted to do something
nice For me

FRED

Should we stay on a little longer

I can keep working on Stanley
Would you mind

Rose rolls over and kisses him

ROSE
Don’t get any ideas

FRED
Not even a small idea A five
minute idea

Rose shuts off the light

ROSE
Wake me early

It’s a compromise Fred accepts But then
are out Rose reaches for him

after the

lights
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 44
She unbuttons his shirt Kisses his bare skin Waits for him
to catch up to her Waits until he is begging Then

She straddles him fully her night-gown still covering her
Teases him until he can’t take another moment and they climb
together

She rolls off And snuggles back to her side of the bed

Fred stares at his wife stunned Who is in this bed with
him

INT KITCHEN -- NIGHT 36

The crack under the kitchen door glows brightly Rose
carefully pushes it open

Shirley’s ample behind rummaging through the refrigerator

ROSE
Same idea I’m starving

Shirley grabs a bottle of wine and two glasses Places them
on the table

SHIRLEY
Had a crazy dream The fridge was
oozing mud Big worms coming out of
the crisper Size of fingers Freud
would have a field day

ROSE
I havent read any--

Rose cuts herself off too much to say Shirley lights a
cigarette She looks weary

SHIRLEY
You regret it

ROSE
Not reading Freud

SHIRLEY
That And dropping out
Smart girl like yourself From
modest means Must have been on
scholarship a girl like you

Rose sees Shirley’s determination drained

SHIRLEY
She was only a few years younger
than you How differently things
might have turned out Why didn’t
they
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 46

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
You know how it feels to have a
secret

Rose shakes her head no But it’s unconvincing

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
You feel glances Hear whispers
You imagine things in people’s
faces And see them step aside when
you pass Afraid to brush up
against you Afraid those dark
thoughts will infect them

A darkness descends

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
They talk In town About me
Rumors Gossip I know what they
think I know their hissings

Shirley sips her wine

ROSE
I havent heard anything

Rose sips her wine Shirley heaves herself up

SHIRLEY
Don’t we have anything sweet around
here

Shirley already in an apron

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
A pie I think You like pie

ROSE
I love pie

SHIRLEY
Then I’1l make you a pie And you

butter and sugar Lining up her ingredients like a lieutenant
marshalling forces

The nurse opens a file cabinet tucks the chart neatly
inside

ROSE

easily
The Nurse is surprised Rose is hardly showing

makes perfect sense
ROSE
Might I bother you for a coke If I
could just sit here for a minute
All maternal warmth
NURSE
You sit tight sweetheart I gota
cola in the break room

The nurse charges out As soon as the door is shut

Rose leaps up from her chair opens the file cabinet Thumbs
through the files frantically

She listens for the nurse’s return Digs deeper into the file

ROSE
Yes sir

RANDY FISHER
Can’t get my carriers to deliver up

with cannibalism in ‘em That’s

Rose laughs a little

ROSE
I’m not much of a reader

She digs into her change purse for some coins

ROSE (CONTD)
But people love to gossip in this
town Don’t they Mr Fisher I mean

The Randy Fisher considers her

RANDY FISHER

ROSE
Up on campus they still talk I
can’t imagine why would any girl do
that Walk into the woods alone
Can you

RANDY FISHER
Not the slightest idea
SHIRLEY

9618 DRAFT 51

ROSE
Do you often stop and give young
girls rides in your postal truck

RANDY FISHER
I’m not sure I like your questions

ROSE
Just wondering if this was a habit
of yours Shuttling the college
girls along your route

RANDY FISHER
I’d never seen Paula before in my
life But it was the Samaritian
thing to do She looked half
frozen nothing but thin sneakers
on She wanted to get dropped off
at the trail head I wasn’t going
to get any further into her
business She said she was going
for a hike And I didn’t like that
seeing as it was almost sundown
She had no knapsack No provisions
I assumed she musta been meeting
someone

ROSE
Like who

RANDY FISHER
Weren’t my business to pry

ROSE
But you dropped her off just the
same

Randy Fisher stares at her

ROSE (CONTD)
It does seem odd a girl like that
Insisting on being left in the
middle of the woods Isn’t that
enough of a plea for help

RANDY FISHER
Everybody in town knows it werent
me that was involved Came forward
right away to the police when I
heard she was missing But you
college folk well somewhere to
shovel your dirt

in that house I mean

She’s referring to Shirley of course

ROSE
I’m sure Fred would love your
invitation he’s so fond of the
Dean

Rose turns to go

CAROLINE
I heard she never leaves the house
these days Or her bed for that
matter She’s gone sick in the
head

Rose looks back a flash of loyalty

SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 53

ROSE
She’s working hard All hours of
the day everyday

Caroline nods Sure sure A likely story

CAROLINE
I only get my information from
Stanley he has the patience of a
saint

Rose smiles sweetly Seeing what Shirley is up against

A hand on Rose’s shoulder Rose jumps It’s PRISSY COLLEGE

Fred Nemser

ROSE

You going back to town Let’s walk
together
And with that Rose is whisked off

INT SHIRLEY’S OFFICE -- DAY 39

A fire crackles trying to ward off the gloomy rainy
afternoon

Shirley lies on the rug Her stockings gathered at her
ankles Her shirt is stained with coffee An ash-tray perched
on her chest

She stares at a tree branch clawing at the window She
listens to the shushing and hushing of the rain

Shirley stares past the tree branch Past the grey menacing
sky The colors are starting to blur Blues and greys
swirling together

Rose stands in the doorway hesitant to open the door
Shirley seems far away in a trance almost She watches
Shirley then Shirley senses Rose’s presence

She stares at her -- intensely Really seeing through her
almost
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 54
ROSE
Shirley are you alright
The tree branch SNAPS at the glass pane and shatters it
Rose rushes into the room to pick up the glass

Shirley drops her feet from the desk the ash-tray spills
everywhere

ROSE (CONTD)
Let me get it Don’t move

Shirley waves her away from the shards of glass She sits up
SHIRLEY
Nevermind all that Tell me of your
adventures
Rose slaps the medical file on the desk
Shirley thumbs the file open
SHIRLEY (CONTD)
“Severe menstrual cramps The last
week of November Too sick to
return home for the holiday”

Shirley waits for the assessment

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
Meaning

ROSE
Miscarriage

SHIRLEY
Then a week later she’s missing
Good work Rosie good work

Then as she flips through the file

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
Oh the poor thing

But there’s a dirge in Shirley’s voice The terror of the
events this poor girl endured The loneliness

Shirley hugs Rose exuberant
SHIRLEY (CONTD)

People are so simple And the post
office --
SHIRLEY

9618 DRAFT 55

ROSE
Randy Fisher thinks she was meeting
someone

SHIRLEY
Did she say that

ROSE
No But that’s the impression he
had

SHIRLEY

The timing is perfect She gets
pregnant won’t go home for
Thanksgiving A week goes by and
she goes to a rendezvous in the
woods

ROSE
But why there

SHIRLEY
Someone who she was ashamed to come
up to campus

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
Or it was someone who didn’t want
to be seen there

ROSE
Because other people would
recognize him

SHIRLEY

Someone recognizable on campus
ROSE

Yes
SHIRLEY

Yes He’s someone with authority
Meet me at the trail and she does

ROSE
A professor

They sit with this

SHIRLEY
So why does she go If you were her-

ROSE
If I was her --
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 56

SHIRLEY
And a confident smart
accomplished man pays attention to
you When you’re a young freshman
never been away from home Never
been in love Would you go

Rose sits with this Would she Of course she would She has

ROSE
I feel badly for her

Shirley nods Rose understands
Shirley plants a kiss on Rose’s cheek

SHTRLEY
Closer Closer

Shirley spies a bundle of letters in Rosie’s hand she
snatches the bundle She combs through Dropping the hate
mail into a canvas bag

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
Evil filth treachery

She stops on a letter

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
Ah one from dear Mum What a treat

Shirley opens the letter reads for a moment Her face now
ashen

Shirley flicks her lighter Lights the letter on fire and
drops it in the fireplace

Then forgetting Rose is there walks out of the office
As soon as Rose hears the heavy tread on the stairs she
creeps behind Shirley’s desk and starts to read the typed
pages

INT KITCHEN -- DAY 40

CRACK The spine is severed A thick blade bisects The pink
pimpled skin of a freshly plucked chicken Dislocates wings
thighs and saws through the breast

Rose pushing up the sleeves of one of Fred’s cardigans

The sweater slips from her shoulders She tries to turn
around but someone is pressed against her
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 57

She arches her neck relaxes into the touch of a hand on her
shoulder now slipping down the back of her dress

A bearded cheek against her neck WAIT IT’S NOT FRED
Rose whips around Stanley stands inches away

STANLEY
Did I startle you Rosie

ROSE
I thoughtyou were--

STANLEY
Just we three for dinner Oh wait
two Shirley doesn’t want to eat
Fred’s up on campus tonight
Advising the Shakespeare Society

Rose instinctively picks up the butcher knife Wipes it with
a dish towel

ROSE
I can bring her up a plate

STANLEY
If she wants to eat she needs to
come to the table

He stirs his drink with an olive laden toothpick smirks at
her takes a sip of his cocktail

STANLEY (CONTD)
You really ought to keep the mail
from her until the end of the day
It’s an unnecessary distraction
She insists on reading those
letters I’ve asked the New Yorker
to stop sending them But
regardless It’s an interruption
It derails her So in the future

ROSE
She’s not a child

Stanley gulps down the remainder of his martini

STANLEY
Who’s saying she is

He plucks the olive off the toothpick and offers it to Rose
She refuses it He pops the olive into his mouth
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 58

STANLEY (CONTD)
We just have to get her back to her
desk Back into her work

Defiant anger flashes over Rose

ROSE
She’s working constantly She
barely stops for lunch

STANLEY
(shocked)
Poor thing she must really be
having a time of it I haven’t seen
anything yet

ROSE
She’s got pages and pages of a
Manuscript Sitting right on her
desk

STANLEY
Youve read it

ROSE
No no of course not

STANLEY
But you can differentiate a stack
of papers from a manuscript Such a
bright girl
Rose fumes Dregs a chicken leg in egg dusts it with flour
then drops it into the hot oil She watches the skin turn
crispy golden

SHIRLEY
Is there any of our pie left

There stands Shirley how long has she been there

STANLEY
Rosie said you’ve got half a
manuscript already Let’s have a
look

SHIRLEY
I wonder why she would say that

Rose looks stricken

ROSE
I don’t think that’s what I said
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 59

STANLEY
So you don’t have pages and pages
of a manuscript Just inquiring
darling You’re not half-way
through a novel you haven’t shown
me

It’s a stand-off

SHIRLEY
No No I don’t Mostly grocery
lists

STANLEY

Well in that case I’1ll pop over
to the Dean’s before dinner

SHTRLEY
You do that

Stanley marches out When he’s gone Almost an exhale

ROSE
I swear I didn’t --

Shirley spins back on Rose A pitcher crashes from a shelf
The house is defending Shirley

She bangs out the back door Rose stands stunned She watches
Shirley lumbering across the yard down to the woods

EXT WOODS -- DAY 41

A BOOTED HEEL is sucked ankle deep in oozing mud Then
another Rose grabs a hold of a branch overheard to steady
her step

ROSE
Shirley

The woods are protective of their captive Rose sees no one
JUMP TO

Shirley alone She stumbles Shirley is surveying the
darkening woods

Her heart racing The canopy of branches closing in on her
Panic Terror Blurred vision She is drenched in sweat

From a muffled place she hears
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 60

ROSE (0S) (CONTD)
Shirley

Shirley tries to scream She can’t catch her breath Branches
twist to choke her

ROSE (0S) (CONTD)
Shirley

The voice is closer Shirley collapses Propped up by a tree
She waits
Rose rushes to her

ROSE (CONTD)
Shirley

Rose sits inches away
ROSE (CONTD)
You’re okay It’s okay I’1l take

you home

SHTRLEY
You’re here

ROSE
Of course I’m here Let’s go home

Rose gathers Shirley up Shirley takes a few steps she’s
wobbly

ROSE (CONT’D)
Just rest a second

Shirley sit on the trunk of a fallen tree The forest still
spinning

With dirty fingers Shirley clears the leaves away from the
base of a tree trunk Revealing

A piece of bark TEEMING WITH MUSHROOMS

SHIRLEY
The amanita phalloides My favorite

The name means nothing to Rose

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
The death cap mushroom The most
poisonous of all the fungi Fatal
to humans if ingested
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 61

Rose backs away from the toxic offering Shirley pries the
piece of bark holding the mushrooms She decapitates a
mushroom holds the cap up for Rose to inspect

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
Don’t you find it exhilarating

ROSE
Exhilarating Terrifying

Shirley palms the cap and blows away the debris

SHIRLEY
Most young women find their
mortality fascinating Not you

ROSE
They shouldn’t The truth is no one
cares all that much if you live or
if you die

Shirley pats the ground next to her sit sit Rose is
instantly ashamed of her outburst

Shirley offers her the mushroom

SHIRLEY
You want to taste

ROSE
(nervous laugh)
No no of course not

Shirley stays silent

Shirley drops the mushroom into Rose’s palm Rose stares at
the deadly thing mesmerized

SHIRLEY
Do you want to split it with me

Rose sniffs it

ROSE
It looks so ordinary

SHIRLEY
It could stop our hearts from
beating

Shirley snatches it away from Rose and PLOPS THE MUSHROOM IN
HER MOUTH
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT
ROSE
Oh god Shirley Shirley Spit it
out

Rose leaps up runs in circle Shirley cackles

SHTRLEY
Shush

But Rose is tugging at her to stand up

ROSE
We have to get you to a hospital
Ohmygod ohmygod I’m going to get
help --

Shirley grabs Rose

SHIRLEY
It’s okay okay It’s not
poisonous

ROSE
We have to--now--wait What

SHIRLEY
It’s not going to kill me

ROSE
But you just said it was the amigla
phallap--whatever

Shirley kicks at some moss under her feet revealing more
mushrooms

SHIRLEY
These are the death cap

She plucks more caps from the piece of bark

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
These are straw mushrooms You had
them in your omelette yesterday
Here try one

She holds out a straw mushroom for Rose to eat

Rose places a hand over her mouth She backs away from
Shirley

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
I like you Rosie I have no reason
to want you dead

SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 63

Rose is trying not to panic

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
Why would I want to harm you

Rose shrugs She is terrified
SHIRLEY (CONTD)
You could run run fast away from
me But you aren’t Why is that
Why do you stay here

Rose drops her hand from her mouth It’s good to feel this
alive Shirley was right it’s thrilling

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
It’s intoxicating Isn’t it A hand
over the flame

Rose nods

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
Can I trust you Rosie

Rose nods “yes”
SHIRLEY (CONTD)
Youre not hiding anything from me
You won’t harm me Or betray me

Rose shakes her head no no

SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
Open up

Shirley waits the mushroom posed like a communion wafer

Then Shirley puts a dirty hand on Rose’s jaw Her fingers
parts Rose’s lips

Shirley places the mushroom onto Rose’s tongue

Rose closes her lips Shirley places a finger to her own
lips

Shhh Their secret

STANLEY
Oh I have eyes and ears everywhere

ROSE
The selections

STANLEY
Yes dear I might have a few
lectures typed up -- if you’d like
to read those as well Or you know

have our own colloquium

He drains his glass

ROSE
I wouldn’t want to impose on your
time

Rose doesn’t know what to say

STANLEY
Oh come now I won’t make you
recite your Latin grammar up on my
lap You’ve a head on you I’m sure
that’s why Shirley is so taken

He pops up for more wine Gestures to her Rose gets up

Rose rustles awake Fred stumbles into the room Banging into
the dresser

FRED
Owww

Rose leaps out of bed to keep him from crashing into the
bureau

FRED (CONTD)
I’m home baby We were having a
celebration

He plunks down on the bed Rose loosens his tie She’s
crawling on top of him shimmying his pants off

ROSE
I missed you tonight You left me
alone with Stanley

FRED

Whoa whoa Should I be worried
ROSE

What
FRED

You have a little crush don’t you
Rose laughs Stares at Fred He’s serious

FRED (CONTD)
A tiny little crush And you like
it Admit it You like the
professors You like them older

ROSE
You’re drunk You sound like a
jealous housewife

FRED
Not too drunk To see what’s what

ROSE
I thought you were advising the
Shakespeare Society Didn’t realize
they brought booze to that

FRED
They don’t Don’t be stupid I
stopped for drinks

turns away

her head Stands in front of him mostly naked A tiny bulge
showing

ROSE
It’s because of --

Fred stares at his wife’s body She’s right
FRED
No no You’re beautiful I’m
wrecked is all
He switches off the light Rose pulls her nightgown back on
Climbs into bed Miles between them Fred stares into the

darkness A secret brewing

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY 45

Rose eavesdrops from the hall

Stanley sits on the couch in his pajamas A nest of papers
around him

Fred dressed for a morning run holds his ground

STANLEY
You want to give one of my
lectures

FRED

No no I want to give one of my
lectures The Mourning Ballads

STANLEY
You want to replace my Mourning
Ballads lecture with your own

FRED
Of course I’m not going to touch
any of the Delta spirituals

I would like you to read my
dissertation

STANLEY
Son Easy You’re under a lot of
pressure With the baby--

FRED
This isn’t about the baby I’d like
you to recommend my work to your
editor

Stanley gets to his feet

STANLEY
I’m not the enemy here I’m just
trying to look out for you

Fred nods The torrent over

FRED
I know I know and like I said I
don’t want to seem ungrateful

Stanley guides Fred to the front door Throwing an arm around
him

STANLEY
Of course I read your dissertation
Of course I did How did you think
you got this job

Fred nods meekly

STANLEY (CONTD)
Alright Good talk Now run out

wasted on the young

Stanley pounds him on the back and shuts the door Watches
him toggle off Gives him a salute turn back into the house

SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 68

STANLEY (CONTD)

Rose emerges from the shadows of the hallway Troubled

INT SHIRLEY’S BEDROOM -- DAY 46

Moments later

Shirley wakes reluctantly Stanley fuming and clutching a mug
of coffee

STANLEY
That boy who’s had everything
handed to him Ivy education
Perfect teeth We would never
behave--

Shirley finds her glasses

SHIRLEY
Alka-selzer and coffee before you
speak another word

Stanley huffs to the bathroom still monologuing

STANLEY
We were always the outsiders
Anywhere we went We fought for
every last crumb that was
accidentally dropped in our path

He’s back with Alka-selzer
STANLEY (CONTD)
But these entitled pricks Just
expect the world to be handed to
them Like it’s their divine right

Shirley gulps down the elixir

SHTRLEY
Give him a lecture what’s the
harm

STANLEY

I built that class I built that
department Year upon year I did
that And he dashes off a mediocre
dissertation
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 69
SHIRLEY
Which you didn’t read

STANLEY
I DIDN’T NEED TO

SHTRLEY
So tell him no

STANLEY
Oh no he’s played the system The
Dean is agog with Mr Sunshine Mr
Golden Boy Wants me to get him
situated for tenure track Over my
dead body will that boy be getting
tenure

SHIRLEY
Just give him enough rope and you
know he’1ll hang himself

Stanley is finally calmed

STANLEY
Good point You’re getting on well
with the wifey

SHTRLEY
She has her moments

STANLEY
I might say you are smitten with
her

SHIRLEY
I don’t smote I’m incapable of
that you goat

Shirley takes his coffee from him Pops a pill Washes it
down

STANLEY
Little ire have we Well that’s a
spark I yearn to see Maybe table
this one Start fresh

He kisses her atop the head she shoves him away back under
the covers she goes

SHIRLEY

last night

Fred perks up

STANLEY (CONTD)
I’ve actually read it twice Both
times last night You were right
I only skimmed it before But it
was sufficient to hire you

Stanley take a healthy gulp of wine he swirls it around his
mouth

STANLEY (CONTD)
Lovely minerality But yes I read
it thoroughly is what I mean to
say
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 75
FRED
That’s excellent
STANLEY
I’m trying to think of the word

Id use to sum it up

Shirley slurps her noodles Enjoying Stanley’s performance

FRED
You can use several

ROSE
I found it very engaging for an
academic--

STANLEY

I’ve got it Let’s see it was
derivative Yes that’s the word

Stanley returns to his pasta Fred is in shock Shirley hides
her smile

FRED
In in in what ways is it
derivative

STANLEY

Oh in the ways that it’s all
derived from others work

Fred is apoplectic

FRED
I spent years and years hundreds
of hours of research-- read
everything--

STANLEY
Yes I’m sure But you didn’t do
any thinking Just the same old
chattering on No new ideas No
positions on any arguments

FRED
(crushed)
No new ideas I-I-think youre over-
simplifying--

Oh don’t despair my boy It’1l
come to you

Shirley pats Fred’s arm

Darling you are hardly the first
to hear this lecture

Salt in the wound

STANLEY
Originality isn’t something one can
simply will to manifest That right
my dear

SHIRLEY
Were it only true

STANLEY
No originality is the brilliant
alchemy of critical thought and
creativity

Fred wipes his mouth he looks ill

ROSE
Oh but your work is original

Stanley shrugs

STANLEY
Who am I to say But it has been
said of me

ROSE
Is that why you have a stock pile
of bought back copies of your book
upstairs

FRED
Honey you don’t have to --

STANLEY
(shrugging Rose off)

I’1ll say this to you Freddie I
read the thing twice scouring the
pages for one faint whiff of an
original idea And then I realized
something that makes me so very
envious of you

Stanley leans in close to confess it

STANLEY (CONTD)
You’ve never had an original idea
so you won’t have to feel the
frustration of missing that
experience Am I correct

(MORE)
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 77

STANLEY (CONTD)
Have you ever thought about
teaching at the high school level
Exceptionally rewarding I imagine

ROSE
You read a bunch of books by
critics and criticized their
writing and call that original If
that’s not derivative I don’t know
what is

Shirley smiles Stanley nods Impressive little imp
STANLEY
Now isn’t that a fun little turn of
phrase That’s the spirit I’m
talking about Fred-o

FRED
I’m going to -- refresh my --

He clutches his empty wine glass

SHIRLEY
Grab the pudding while you’re up

Stanley lights a cigarette Rose follows Fred

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
Now you’ve done it

Stanley refills his glass

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
Was it really that bad

STANLEY
You know how insulted I am by
mediocrity If it was awful that
would have been exciting But
terrifically competent There’s no
excuse for that

That’s her love right there across the table

SHTRLEY
None at all

Fred barrels back in opening a fresh bottle of wine

Shirley and Stanley are delighted
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 78

FRED
Well I respect your opinion I
really do But it’s not shared by
the Dean At all

Stanley nods
FRED (CONTD)
Perhaps we can discuss this on

Stanley smiles What a grand idea
SHIRLEY
Oh it’s that time again the

Dean’s party

Fred lazers in on Stanley Rose brings the pudding

FRED
Rose and I are going

STANLEY
Splendid

INT HALL LIVING ROOM SHIRLEY’S OFFICE -- NIGHT 60

Through the wavy glass of the French doors Shirley is ina
mad fugue at the type-writer

Stanley hovers in the shadows
He steps to the living room bar to refresh his Scotch and
side-winds his way past the doors A brief pause from the

typing as he passes He seizes his chance

Shirley fixes him in her sights ready to fire

SHIRLEY
I’m sure you just forgot to mention
it

STANLEY

I’m sure I mentioned it But if
were going to be treated to a
scene I for one would loved to
be fore-warned

SHTRLEY
I’m not the one for dramatics

STANLEY
You know how little I care for
appearances But I do concern
myself over yours You don’t look
up for it my dear

SHIRLEY
I’m going to the party

STANLEY
That would require you leaving the
house something that seems
difficult for you to manage at this
point in time

SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 81

I am going to that party

Stanley relinquishes
STANLEY
We both know that’s a horrid little
Greek tragedy in the making But as
you wish

He shuts the door Shirley stares back at her typewriter

INT SHIRLEY’S OFFICE -- DAY 61

Shirley wakes lying in front of the long dead fire She’s
stiff She finds a mug of cold coffee A film of cream
stretched across the top

She digs around for some blue pills Pops one in her mouth
Downs it with the coffee

Rose tiptoes into the office with a fresh pot of coffee sets
down a breakfast plate

ROSE
Morning I’m going to stop at the
butcher’s Pork chops tonight That
sound good
Shirley doesn’t respond

ROSE (CONTD)
Alright then pork chops it is

Rose nudges the plate closer to Shirley

ROSE (CONT’D)
Your eggs are getting cold

Shirley ignores her

ROSE (CONT’D)
You need to eat

Shirley picks up the plate and drops it on the rug Rose is
shocked she bends down to pick it up

SHIRLEY
LEAVE IT

Rose scoops the eggs back onto the plate Drops the plate
back on Shirleys desk

SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 82

ROSE
The polite thing to do would be to
eat it while the eggs are hot

SHTRLEY
I will eat when I feel like it I
will bathe when I feel like it I
will sleep when I feel like it I
will shit when I feel like it

Rose wipes her hands defiantly on her apron

ROSE
Is the tantrum over

Shirley looks at the tiny mountain of force in front of her
She wills herself not to cry She addresses a far corner of
the room

Rose impassive
SHIRLEY (CONTD)
I need to go buy new clothes for
this fucking party

Rose nods

Unforgiving morning sun

Shirley stares at the insurmountable gulf between the porch
and the car

ROSE
We can stay here for a while

SHIRLEY

Rose guides Shirley down the front steps The grip on her arm
is a vice

Shirley’s breathing is shallow Rose places a steadying arm
around Shirley’s waist They are in lock step

Shirley lets the skirt drop on the floor Rose waits

ROSE (0S) (CONTD)
Let me help With the zipper

The curtain parts Rose slides into the dressing room Sees
the distraught Shirley crumpled in defeat

Rose with a maternal patience unzips the skirt Places it
under Shirleys feet Lifts them one by one into the skirt

Then Rose glides the skirt up over her ankles Over her
calves under the ragged hem of her slip Up over her thighs
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 85

Shirley watches herself being dressed Rose nudges Shirley to
her feet Disappears behind her as she pulls the shirt over
Shirley’s hips Then zips her up

ROSE (CONTD)

shoulder Rose fishes under the skirt Pulls the slip
straight Then smooths the sides of the skirt

Shirley is staring at the buffet For there stands Paula
pawing through the sandwiches

Paula picks one up and drops it on the floor Giggles

Now Rose heads straight to the buffet She picks up a

like she’s wet herself She reaches for a bottle of wine to
refill her glass

You would bore him to death ina

A flash of anger How dare this ogress insult her

I would comfort him

Shirley takes the jab and hits back

SHIRLEY
He’s an expert at finding a willing
pair of legs to open wide For
comfort

CAROLINE
Youd die without him he says
That’s the only reason he stays

That stings Shirley quickly grabs Caroline’s arm

TAP-TAP-TAP Shirley smacks two fingers against the inside of
Caroline’s wrist Mutters something under her breath

stumbles to her feet

The candles on the buffet extinguish The Effigy swings
madly (Perhaps the chandelier comes crashing down)

out of the room

Shirley sits on the front porch swing She is wrapped in an

over-sized flannel hunting jacket

Her house-slippers drag back and forth along the floorboards

The swing creaks a rhythmic complaint

Shirley pulls hard on the cigarette stares into the scrawny

branches of the grand maple tree

Rose rushes up the steps arms full of groceries stamping

off the chill

Down in town

Rose shakes her head Shirley stares hard at Rose

ROSE
No one said a word to me

SHIRLEY
Come here You’re hiding something
Why are you avoiding me

ROSE
I’m not I haven’t

Shirley smiles at the lie She waits Rose’s hands flutter
over her coat she’s flush she unfastens her coat Rose
presses herself against the porch column Trying to keep
herself steady

Shirley swings faster her slippers tucked under the seat
Her knees brush against Rose’s dress

SHIRLEY
I don’t believe you

Shirley’s eyes trace over Rose’s calves Strong lean The
outline of her hips The dress stretching ever so slightly
below the waist The tiny folds draping around the contours
of her pregnant belly

Rose feels Shirley’s stare She inches closer to the swing

On the up-swing Shirley’s knee grazes the inside of Rose’s
thigh Then is gone Then is back
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 96

ROSE
Well it’s the truth

Rose unbuttons the top button of her blouse She is on fire
She clutches with one hand the chain of the swing It jerks
Shirley from the lulling motion

Shirley pushes off with her feet Gaining her cadence again

SHIRLEY
Do not go gentle into that good
night

The swing drives purposefully Bringing Shirley’s knee
between Rose’s legs

Rose shrugs out of her coat The buttons of her blouse
straining under the motion

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
Rage rage against the dying of the
light

Rose fishes out her necklace its links pool in the dip of
her clavicle

An inhalation of breath as Shirley’s swings nearer and
nearer

Rose shakes her head no Not trusting her ability to form
words

you are standing And he he just--

carrying on just on the other side
of that front door The moon
casting our shadows Those shadows
griped so tightly ever so briefly
as one beast

Shirley swings

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
You should thank me for saving your
life

Rose let’s go of the chain With a swift step she is standing
over Shirley She slips her thigh between Shirley’s knees
then spreads those knees wide apart so she can stand between
them

Shirley leans back on the swing Well well well the little
Rosie is quite lovely

Rose leans over and brushes the stray strands of hair from
Shirley’s forehead tucks them delicately behind her ear
Rose leans over to whisper into Shirley’s ear Her necklace
brushes against Shirley’s face

ROSE
I should thank you

Rose’s lips linger near Shirley’s neck Shirley closes her
eyes feels the breath crawl over her skin

Rose peals off Shirley’s glasses Holds her face in her
hands Presses her lips on Shirley’s brow Inhales the sweet
scent

Shirley’s hand hovers centimeters away from Rose’s hip
Then in an instant Shirley kicks the swing back Rose sparks
to attention She steps back Released from a spell Where is

she What’s happened

drop with her napkin Then checks herself

The tension between the women is palpable Stanley clocks it

wife was before you married her

FRED

Hands on her lap Rose presses the tinges of her fork into
the palm of her hand Then reaches for some wine

Oh god a foot It’s touching Rose’s leg under the table
She flashes a quick glance at Shirley who is only paying
attention to Fred

The foot reaches higher and higher up Rose’s skirt She lets
out a short gasp then covers it with a cough

STANLEY (CONTD)

Id say it’s one of the greatest
chimeras perpetuated by Western
Literature Wouldn’t you agree

Above the table Rose concentrates on her plate Fred is
talking but Rose can’t focus on the words

her arm Draws her in

Shirley checks Rose’s forehead A surreptitious hand crawls
up her thigh Rose breaks free

ROSE

Fred obeys Rose looks back into the dining room as Shirley

college across the country Lonely
girls who can’t make the world
notice them Don’t tell me I don’t
know her Don’t you dare

Stanley is shocked by the outburst

good

Shirley throws something at him He ducks and quits while

EXT BENNINGTON MAIN STREET INT BUTCHER SHOPOUTSKIRTS OF90
TOWN -- DAY

Rose pants in a daze through downtown Bennington
Inside the Butcher Shop Mrs Claussen chats up the Butcher

MRS CLAUSEN
Well you know how stubborn my old
man can be Never wanting any to-
dos but if we can’t mark 32 years
with that company with a little
celebratory meatloaf Then I don’t
know what

Rose passes the Butcher shop window
Time cut
Rose trudging along the road on the outskirts of town

The Morris Minor pulls up to the curb Shirley lowers the
window

SHTRLEY
Get in the car

ROSE
I’m not going back
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 110

SHIRLEY
Ill take you wherever you want

ROSE
I don’t want to go home
SHIRLEY
Where do you want to go dear
ROSE
To the trail head
SHIRLEY
The baby needs to rest Let’s go
tomorrow
ROSE

Shirley considers this She pulls the car back onto the road

92 EXT GLASTENBURY MOUNTAIN TRAIL -- DAY 92

Shirley pulls into a empty clearing She stops the car
Through the windshield the towering Glastenbury Mountains

They both take in the scene

SHIRLEY
Alright You’ve seen it Now let’s
go back
In a flash Rose hands Shirley the baby and bolts from the
car
93 EXT GLASTENBURY MOUNTAIN TRAIL -- DAY 93

Shirley trudges through the mud holding the bundled baby
Rose legions ahead

SHTRLEY
Rose Rose Come back

But Rose soldiers ahead as if in a trance
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 111
SHIRLEY (CONTD)
Youll freeze to death

Shirley watches the red dot of Rose’s coat enveloped in the
woods She trudges on

The woods thicken Shirley swats back branches
The sky is suddenly overcast

SHIRLEY (CONT’D)
Rose

Shirley is disoriented She steps up the path a few feet
realizes it’s the wrong direction

The Rowan berries lie trampled on the trail leaving a bloody
a track Yes This is the right path

Shirley is sprinting down the trail becoming winded She
scans the woods for Rose

The brush STRETCHES AND CLAWS like reflections in a fun-
house mirror

In the distance lurking behind tree trunks is the man with
the fedora He stares at her and then vanishes

The flurries kick up now falling in sheets of white

From far off the sing-song tune of a carousel calliope

The music grows stronger as Shirley hikes down the trail

SHIRLEY (CONTD)
(hoarse)
Rose Come back

Shirley is running full tilt She trips and skids down the
trail kicks up mud It cakes her coat hair and glasses The
baby is unscathed

EXT GLASTENBURY LOOKOUT POINT -- DAY 94

A clearing on the trail Vast vista of the Glastenbury
Mountains A sheer drop below The mid-morning sun casting an
iridescent veil over the tree-line

Rose stands a few feet from the drop-off

Rose inches towards the edge unbuttons her coat She feels
an intoxicating rush of the winter wind

SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 112

Rose stares down at her feet Nearly cemented in the slushy
mud

SHIRLEY (0S)
Step away

Shirley extends her hand

ROSE
Just a hop really Slide the right
foot forward--

She slides her foot to the very edge

ROSE (CONT’D)
Youre right Barely any energy at
all One hop One quick jerk It
all would be over

Shirley is inches from her ready to grab her coat
Rose is frozen with fear and ecstacy of the possibility

SHIRLEY
You think it was the baby that
ruined you It wasn’t He was weak
Hell always be weak But you won’t
ever again have to feel what this
first time feels like That Rose is
dead to you now

Rose jumps Her body catapults in slow motion down the side
of the mountain Her coat flapping like a useless parachute

Now her body is thrashing through tree branches skidding
down a rocky ravine Until

Her lifeless body settles flat on her back under a canopy
of pines

Shirley stands at the cliff edge She smiles up at the
heavens

EXT HYMAN-JACKSON HOUSE -- DAY 95

Fred loads suitcases into an idling taxi
Stanley watches the progress

STANLEY
Ah my boy I’m sorry things have
taken such a turn But you two are
young -- youll figure it out

SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 113
STANLEY (CONTD)
A spell at the mother-in-law’s
Always a good penance

FRED
Yes quite

STANLEY
And I’m sure some other position
will pop up soon Always does

Rose strides from the house

Stanley moves to hug her she shuns him and huddles into the
cab Doors slam

Stanley stands on the porch and waves the taxi farewell

INT TAXI BACKSEAT -- CONTINUOUS 96

Fred sits up front with the driver banished from his wife’s
side

Rose baby swaddled close to her chest

FRED
You’1l feel better again in no
time

ROSE

I feel fine now

FRED
You know what I mean A little
rest A little time away
Everything will be back to normal
Don’t worry Rosie

ROSE
No no I’m never going back to
that Little wifey Little Rosie
That was madness

She turns looks out the back window at Stanley standing
sentinel on the porch

Then from an up-stairs window a curtain rustles
SHIRLEY PEERS DOWN
Rose watches as the Shirley’s figure grows smaller and

smaller in the window until she wonders if it was ever there
at all

Shirley pounds on the typewriter possessed
Stanley delivers a drink He watches her work

door quietly behind him

INT FRONT HALL DINING ROOM -- NIGHT 98

The table set for dinner She glances through the French
doors of her office

Stanley in the office Shirley’s manuscript in his lap He

notice

Shirley paces Smokes Pours two drinks

INT SHIRLEY’S OFFICE -- NIGHT 99

Shirley delivers a drink to Stanley He doesn’t touch it She
stands over him

Shirley flops into her desk chair

SHIRLEY
Just tell me one thing--

Stanley doesn’t look up from the pages

He makes a mark on the manuscript licks his thumb and turns
over a new page

STANLEY
Go Away

Shirley stares at him Trying to read his thoughts After a
moment Stanley shoos her away with the flick of his wrist

Shirley storms out

A roasted chicken adorns the table Candles lit Wine poured
Shirley picks at a plate of potatoes

Stanley emerges from the office He sits in his chair Sips
his wine Shirley smokes

They stare at each other in silence until

STANLEY
Your book is brilliant darling

Huge sigh of relief from Shirley
STANLEY (CONTD)
Fucking gorgeous I don’t know how
you did it

Shirley is too overwhelmed to speak

STANLEY (CONTD)
I have some notes of course

SHTRLEY
Of course

STANLEY
This is going to be the one Don’t
lose sight of that

SHIRLEY
(verge of tears)
It hurts This one It hurts more
than the others

Stanley is on his feet He hunts for a record
STANLEY
But you’ve done it My bride My
horrifically talented bride

He scoops her out of her chair She holds his bearded face in
her hands

SHIRLEY
I missed you I missed you so much

They kiss Then kiss again
SHIRLEY 9618 DRAFT 116

Stanley breaks away to start the record Lady Day croons

You go to my head

And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne
They dance Stanley leans in winking

STANLEY
Your book really is quite good

Shirley folds herself closer to him
SHIRLEY
What would I do without you What
would I do
They keep dancing

THE END
