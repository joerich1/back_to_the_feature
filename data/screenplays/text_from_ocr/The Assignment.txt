SHOOTING DRAFT

ESTABLISHING SHOT - EXTREME CLOSE - UP - COBBLESTONES -
EARLY MORNING

TITLE SEQUENCE BEGINS

We OPEN with the screen filled with a dark gray cut
the middle by a black crevice We should be unsure of
we are looking at Is it the surface of the moon or
primeval canyon covered in volcanic ash Just then a
with a yellowish tinge finds its way down through the
and further divides the screen in two like a river
dividing East from West perhaps

CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to reveal that the dark gray
filled the screen was in fact two paving stones on a
street and the yellowish river that ran down the middle
the stones comes in two tiny streams that lead to two

boys who are peeing on the pavement laughing at their
mischief The boys are twins They wear backpacks and

set to go off to school Just then we HEAR the voice of

children on their way as TITLES CONTINUE and the city
more and more to life and we hover across a small

INT HOTEL ROOM - PARIS - EARLY MORNING

The first thing we SEE in this shot which should appear
seamless in its one continuous motion transition from

preceding scene is a spider-web We are TIGHT on the

perhaps a mans voice perhaps not The sounds build to

witnessed by coincidence this attack

JACK
Thats right

DU FOLTIERE
And you have told my subordinate
that you recognized the terrorist as
Carlos

Du Foltiere pulls out a small notebook to take notes

JACK
Thats not what I told him I said
he recognized me Afterwards I
realized who he was By then it was
too late

Ah yes The deputy chief of station
did not recognize him But he

recognized you

of straps and springs He opens his briefcase and

to the harness a 32 caliber Beretta He fumbles with
adjustments racing against time Finally he seems to

adjusted everything just so Then he lowers his arm to

side Then he raises the right arm as if shaking hands

His eyes strain to get a better look at the terrorist
arm down at his side

As the bus parks by the DC 9 Carlos jumps out and

the media Not the customary V-sign but the wave of a
celebrity The hostages then under their captors

file compliantly out of the bus and onto the plane A
of exhausted bleary-eyed middle-aged men in expensive
and in need of a shave Carlos however is as fresh

and energetic as the morning of the attack And hes
definitely savoring the moment

smile crosses his lips as he turns towards him He
cigarette out and crosses right over to Jack up close
as they say very personal The snowflakes whirl
surrealistically around them as the two stand face to
CARLOS
Pardon monsieur

at Jack and smiles

Jack turns to look at Mickens Mickens indicates the
photographers

MICKENA
You dont want your picture taken

shaking his hand

Jack is momentarily confused He has turned to Mickens
thinking perhaps he was calling out a warning and now

moment for the shot has passed He turns back to Carlos
shrugs and steps over to the Austrian minister so that
Minister now is between Jack and Carlos and the shot is

To the Jerusalem stone paving stones that make up the

lines of paving stones set one next to the other until

glowing cigarette comes into view and then a foot which
crushes it out There should be something in this

that is reminiscent of our opening a foreboding that
as the cracks in the Parisian paving stones led us to
once before perhaps these new stones will lead us once
to some act of terror

RAMIREZ

Then you might want to have them dig
her up because I intend to sue her

Jack chuckles
JACK
Commander Ramirez when I said I was

have been more specific Im from
the CIA
Jack reaches down opens his briefcase and pulls out a
photo album-like briefing book He opens it up and
to Ramirez On the first page there is an 8x10
of a photo of Carlos entering a building It is grainy
it certainly looks exactly like Ramirez
JACK
Does the man in that picture look
familiar

Ramirez looks at the picture with the same look on his

single most vicious terrorist in the
world Hes personally carried out
or masterminded the worst terrorist
attacks in modern history Men women

JACK
To serve your country to protect
her from her enemies Well Carlos is
one of her enemies now And hell

terrorism unfortunately is a growth
industry

RAMIREZ
Why are you telling me all this

JACK
Lieutenant Commander the governments
of most countries in the free world
have been after Carlos for ten years
and we have nothing to show for it
There is exactly one person in the
world who can help us get Carlos
And that person is you

RAMIREZ
What do you mean to get him

JACK
All I can tell you is it may take as
much as six months to a year of
preparation It will involve a high
degree of risk That much said you
may never as much as lay eyes on him
yourself But if we succeed Carlos
wont be a threat to anyone anymore
Now I know youre going to need some
time to think about it so

RAMIREZ
No I dont need any time The answers
no

obviously uncomfortable for him

JACK
Your mother is Irish Irish
American

RAMIREZ
Yes

JACK
Something wrong Miguel

RAMIREZ
-No not really

JACK
Your father was in a Cuban prison if
Im correct

Ramirez turns and looks at him in surprise

JACK
Your mother used to take you to visit
him there didnt she

RAMIREZ
(quietly)
Yes

JACK
Im sure thats a disturbing memory

He looks Ramirez straight in the eyes

RAMIREZ
You didnt set this up in a prison
because it was the first piece of
real estate you were shown did you

sir

JACK
Lets just say everything has its
purpose And Miguel no one is to

from the roof encapsulating this area to protect all of
state of the art computer equipment from the dust

this plastic shrouded space we SEE technicians at

which display every approach to the prison as well as
which display the surveillance images transmitted back
satellite

JACK
This is our surveillance and satellite
tracking center Just as we are
plotting to destroy Carlos if he
knew what were trying to do I assure
you hed try to find a way to kill
us first

INT PLASTIC COVERED COMMAND CENTER - ABANDONED PRISON

Jack pushes through the plastic shroud into a command
like room He and Ramirez enter This place is high-
computers and neon lighting

JACK
Carlos has two main safe houses One
in Libya one in East Germany We
have satellites that pass over each
one three times a day Unfortunately
the Russians know exactly when our
satellites are in position so we
have to assume that Carlos knows as
well

They cross over to the satellite tracking monitors
display both the Libyan and East German safe houses
in front of one of the monitors is Amos typing
into the satellite tracking system

JACK

Theres one person I want you to
meet though I think the two of you
have already been introduced
Amos now turns and comes around to Ramirez

AMOS
Hello Miguel My name is Amos

Ramirez stares at him

RAMIREZ
Oh yeah I didnt recognize you
without my foot chained to the floor

AMOS
I hope there are no hard feelings

RAMIREZ
There are a lot of hard feelings
And Im still gonna sue you when
this is over

JACK
Miguel this is a combined Israeli-
American operation Amos here knows
Carlos better than anyone in the
free world He was the one who took
that picture of Carlos in Libya

RAMIREZ
If you could get a picture of him
why didnt you just kill him

AMOS
Dont let all this equipment fool
you Carlos still has the home court
advantage He has the best protection

in the world three layers at least
at all times Next and maybe most
important Carlos himself The

French DST came to arrest him once
He was at his apartment drunk
playing his guitar He actually had
them convinced it was all a mistake
Then he went into his bathroom took
a shave mind you so he would look
his best for the interrogation and
when he came out managed to shoot
each of them through the forehead
Then he got the informer who had
betrayed him put him down on his
nees and killed him Think of it
He took a shave and didnt even nick

himself once
Amos is quiet lets that sink in

AMOS
Finally there are political
realities Whoever hits Carlos has
to realize that hell unleash against
himself a fanatical wave of terrorist
activity in retribution

JACK
That by the way is the last question
youre going to ask From now on
youll get information when and how
we want you to get it Not before
You dont ask questions you just do
what youre told

thumb

and index finger and puts it right up to Ramirezs
temple

and goes

JACK
Dead And Ill tell you the truth I
honestly in my heart of hearts dont
care whether you live or die Dont
take that personal I dont care
whether I live or die I do care
about getting Carlos Thats all I
care about

RAMIREZ
But nothing personal right

AMOS
Im not as cold-blooded as my American
friend it would bother me very
much if you were dead so we will
teach you to stay alive but no
questions just do Otherwise

He puts the imaginary gun to Ramirezs temple

RAMIREZ
When do we start

JACK
You already have What were the names
on the last three tombstones you
passed on your right

RAMIREZ
I I dont know I wasnt looking
I wasnt paying attention

JACK
Thats what will get you killed
Carlos is always looking always

paying attention Always

AMOS
Because Carlos is the master of the
techniques of survival which we will
teach you and because he is an
efficient killer for whoever employs
him then for him there are simply
no rules Unlike you Miguel youre
a rule follower arent you

Ramirez says nothing

AMOS
Carlos is the opposite of that and
thats whats so seductive you know
He can kill whomever he chooses
ravish whoever he chooses take
whatever he chooses Do whatever

walk toward the cemetery we SEE
who wears a lightweight white parka so that he shivers

in
the cold in contrast to Jacks heavy winter gear
Ramirez
carries what appears to be a gun
JACK
You need to not only remember the
names on every tombstone but where
they are so when I call out a name
you whirl and shoot
They walk into a scene that is completely surreal
Standing
behind every tombstone is one of the crew of trainers
Each man wears a white parka and white pants against
the
freezing cold In the center of their impromptu circle
stands

Ramirez also wearing white but of much lighter
material so
that he shivers in the cold All of them including

Ramirez
hold paint pellet guns It is a cemetery full of living
targets which can shoot back Jack stands outside the
circle
RAMIREZ
Its kind of cold You think I might
be able to borrow a warmer jacket
from someone
JACK
Brisson We dont want you to be
comfortable Thats just what will
get you killed
Ramirez hesitates a moment trying to remember where
the
tombstone with the name Brisson is The trainer who
stands
behind the Brisson tombstone has no such hesitation
He
fires at Ramirez and an ugly black splotch of paint
explodes

on Ramirezs white suit Ramirez shakes his head in
frustration

JACK

Ramirez whirls misses one is hit again with another

black

splotch but hits the Paquet tombstone square in the
chest

with a black splotch of his own

INT KITCHEN SET - PRISON - DAY

In the middle of a huge room a movie set has been
erected

There are flats supported by sand bags which form the
set

of a kitchen The set is perfect in every way but its
position

inside of a huge prison hall lends a quality of the
macabre

since no movie is being shot here and no audience will
ever

see these performances Jack is there with Ramirez He
opens

the refrigerator and Ramirez looks inside as Jack times
him

on his watch then closes the refrigerator Ramirez
sneezes

He has caught a cold but must ignore it

RAMIREZ

maybe some cottage cheese a couple
bottles of beer some tomatoes I
dont know

What kind of milk how many cartons
open or closed what kind of juice
how full was the bottle was it

Ramirez whirls and hits the trainer in his shoulder at

emotion

He doesnt want to be Che Guevara

notices that the snow mobile changes direction as well
continues to home in on him And then there is a second
mobile And then a third all of them coming straight

INT CAFETERIA - ABANDONED PRISON - DAY

It is after lunch and Jack and Amos are eating ice
sundaes while Ramirez sits eating the last bit of
from the huge bowl

AMOS
You finish all your porridge

RAMIREZ
(deadly)
Yeah yeah I finished all my
porridge

AMOS
Good now you can have some more

He motions for the waiter who crosses with a fresh pot
starts to ladle it out into Ramirezs bowl Ramirez

reaches
up and tears at his tie and rips open the top button
Ramirez
explodes batting the waiters hand away and sending the
bowl
flying
RAMIREZ
Enough of this porridge shit man hi

With that he rips off the tie and rips open the shirt

Congratulations Youre acting like
a child like a spoiled brat
JACK

And not a Navy Lieutenant Commander
which is exactly what would get you
killed

AMOS
Finally youre acting like a willful
spoiled child which is just what
Carlos was

JACK
We couldnt just let you study Carlos
If this thing is going to work you
have to become him
Ramirez looks at him in disgust

RAMIREZ
The two most elite intelligence
services in the world and the best
you can come up with is this porridge
bullshit

AMOS
As a child Carlos was fed that
porridge that you love so much every
day He hated it Every woman or man
hes ever been close to he told about

that porridge how the very smell
of it made him sick And now it makes
you sick

JACK

When he was in school he was a scrawny
little kid The last one to get picked
for any teams He felt as clumsy as
weve made you feel

AMOS
His father smoked cigars the same
ones whose smell you complained about
The only cover that can save your
life is the one you believe
yourself Now are you ready to
pass the next test

Ramirez just looks at them in a kind of shock

AMOS
Ill take that for a yes Youre

RAMIREZ

She hasnt been here in a week Then
why was the sponge still damp It
means she washed dishes Take a look
at the dish rack Theres water in
the tray underneath it Probably
from a couple of plates Theres a
bit of water in the silverware tray

The milk is still fresh not even
a hint of being sour and the date on
it is a week from today means she

just bought it yesterday or the day
before The margarines fresh-bought
but its already been opened Same
with the bread

AMOS
How do you know it was a man

RAMIREZ

(ignoring him a beat)
She might have met him at a bar
because theres a book of matches in
the garbage She was probably careful
to throw the cigarette away but
theres still a bit of ash and that
cigarette smell at the bottom of the
liner

I think they made love on the sofa
because one of the cushions has been
turned over and theres the
indentation of a tennis shoe print

obviously not part of the bargain

EXT SAFE HOUSE - DEAD SEA - SUNSET
At first we should not realize we are near a building
of any
kind We open on a WIDE ANGLE on the Dead Sea from a
stunning
POV CRANE DOWN to reveal the silhouette of Ramirez
smoking
a cigarette We now SEE that his nose is exactly that
of
Carlos He has just a bit of dark circles left under
his
eyes just enough to make him seem moody He tosses the
cigarette and turns to enter a room Now we see that
this is
a deserted barracks pock-marked with artillery shells
and

machine gun bullet holes from past wars
EXT BALCONY - SAFE HOUSE - DEAD SEA - SUNSET

Ramirez turns to enter the barracks with a wide-angle

of the

landscape overlooking the Dead Sea He now wears a
black T-

shirt and black jeans The Peugeot is parked near the
barracks

that sits on the edge of the cliff in bg

INT SAFE HOUSE - DEAD SEA - SUNSET

start TIGHT on a shot of an ashtray It is overflowing
with

cigarettes A womans hand picks up the butt that is in
the

ashtray and with the last of its ember she lights
another

cigarette off it She is CARLA mid-thirties hard
edged

which mars the beauty she still has She is intense
neurotic

and bitter

She and Ramirez are alone in the living room She sits
ina

corner We become aware of the room It is a study in

contrasts Light shoots in through shell holes and
cracks in

ruined walls And yet the interior is somehow soft

sensuous
with thick carpet muslin drapes and a large bed that
resembles at one and the same time a boxing ring and
an
altar She pays no attention to Ramirez She doesnt
even
acknowledge that hes entered the room She is ina
kind of
reverie
CARLA
The thing about Carlos is he
doesnt lose himself with a woman
not with a lover maybe with a
whore I dont know I wasnt his
whore Lovers are different to him
he might have a use for them so

he has to seduce them properly He
has to make sure theyre so crazy
about him theyll do anything for
him
his

and now
she

RAMIREZ
When did you

She holds up a hand without looking at him commanding

silence

CARLA
Shhh Youre not here

She rocks herself back and forth comforting herself
for the first time we see the bottle of Irish whiskey
holds at her side She raises it takes a long gulp
the fluid dripping down the corner or her mouth She
bother to wipe it away It is there next to tearstains
her cheeks

Slowly her rocking back and forth her primal

the act of an abused and abandoned child will turn into
strokes caresses of a secret style from a phantom

will get her in the mood for what she must do She must
herself wet She must get herself ready She must

what it is to be seduced by Carlos Her hand is her

now
CARLA
You dont exist until Im ready to
let you exist and then you do

exactly what I say

She leans her head back and conjures Carlos up in her

CARLA
Its not pleasure for him its
its its this sick kind of
conquest you know this seduction
hes got to make you not just a lover
but a disciple a worshipper He
brainwashes you with his body
so so youll do anything

you see because hes the perfect
lover he does it all to not to
please you but to excite you
to to make it dangerous for you
and then thats very sexy too toa
woman that danger like he could
kill you in a second but instead
he makes you come So hes almost
killed you you see And you have
this orgasm right then and its like
hes killed you and there isnt
anything left of you and he makes
you be born again the way he wants
you to be So there isnt a thought
in your brain that he hasnt put
there Not a feeling in your body
that he hasnt put there

She masturbates herself stopping just short of climax
Then

she looks up at Ramirez acknowledges his presence and
lets

him exist

youre not just a box that were
going to fill up with our own ideas
You have a right to know certain
things

RAMIREZ
I appreciate that Amos a lot
Its funny I started out hating
you I mean Im still gonna sue
you dont think youre off the hook
for my broken ribs but

AMOS
But now you love me and were going
to run away to San Francisco and
find a reformed rabbi to perform a
mixed gay marriage Listen to me
Youre going to feel more alone than
youve ever felt in your life It
will hit you all of a sudden and
youll think your hearts going to
jump out of your chest youll think
everyone around you can hear your
heart beating and that everyone
around you is an enemy agent I want
you to be prepared for that So you
can deal with it Understand

In the far distance we are vaguely aware of a huge
truck

barreling along coming straight down the highway

had in training We were going to

student ever scored higher than this
man We set up his cover for six
months in Argentina He was perfect
And then we sent him to Beirut He
got off the plane went to his hotel
went up to his room and had a nervous
breakdown

Suddenly it seems the truck is right on top of them

straight for them like monster in a childs nightmare
passes within inches and Ramirez has to fight to keep
jumping as the truck roars past them It is not a

just a truck Then again it could have killed them
same

AMOS
We had to mount an operation to send
in a man posing as a doctor so we
could drug him and get him out ona
plane Okay Now you understand
Nothing prepares you I want you to
know that so when it hits you you
dont panic you feel the fear and
then get rid of it
