He puts the paperback on her desk and slides it toward her
She looks at the book and then up at him

Hull leaves shutting the door behind him The man looks
around the small office noticing all the details the walls
are covered with framed citations official plaques and
several framed newspaper articles on the capture of various
serial killers There are several gory police photographs
from case files taped on the side of a filing cabinet

The man wanders over to the desk which is littered with
papers pens a few more case file photos and one framed
eight by ten glossy color photograph of a MAN in his twenties
standing next to a WOMAN in her late forties with graying
brown hair The man reaches for the photograph

EXT FBI HEADQUARTERS -- LATER

A car pulls into the parking lot and AGENT WILLIAM DOYLE
gets out He is the man from the photograph except he is
older now in his mid-thirties and has a hard world-weary
yet powerful look to him He looks at the ambulance as he
walks up the little concrete path to the building Thunder
rumbles off in the distance

INT FBI HEADQUARTERS -- CONTINUOUS

Doyle walks into the reception area where the operator is
reading the paperback

DOYLE
Whats that ambulance doing out there

The operator glances up from her book shrugs and goes back
to reading He frowns at her and exits into the main office
where there are several lines of cubicles that are mostly
empty except for one or two Along the walls of the room

are enclosed offices with large glass windows -He strides
down the hall All of the offices are dark except for one
Doyle looks at the lit office window and sees the back of a
mans head sitting inside Hull sits at one of the desk
cubicles He looks up at Doyle from his computer

DOYLE

HULL
Nope Said hed only talk to you

Agent William Doyle

He extends his hand to Fenton but Fenton looks down at the
framed picture in his hands ignoring Doyles gesture

Doyle sees the picture hes holding the one of him and the
woman and snatches it out of his hands

DOYLE

Doyle crosses the little office and puts the picture back on
his desk facing him

FENTON

FENTON
Fenton Meeks I have some information

FENTON (CONTD)

who the Gods Hand killer is

Doyle stares at him flatly but he doesnt continue They
stare at each other for a moment

DOYLE
Alright Ill bite Who

FENTON
You havent even heard me out yet
and already you doubt me Why

DOYLE
Because in a case like this no one

FENTON
I promised him I would a long time

Doyle rubs the back of his neck still looking at Fenton

DOYLE
Ive got a lot of problems with what
youve just told me But Ill just
lay out the two major ones for you
First of all youre describing events
that you couldnt have possibly
witnessed

oF FENTON
— I described the suicide and the
ambulance drivers reasons for
stopping as I imagined them to be

DOYLE
Youve got a pretty sick imagination

FENTON
(shrugs)

Maybe but the facts remain that my
brother did call and he did kill
himself And the ambulance driver
‘did stop and I did catch him going
at it like a thirteen year old boy
in that bathroom I filled in the
blanks with my imagination and from
what Matt told me

DOYLE
Matt The paramedic

Fenton nods

DOYLE (CONTD)
And wheres your brothers body now

FENTON
Buried in the Tyler Rose Garden

DOYLE
And you did all this because of some
promise you made

FENTON
Yep

DOYLE
Thats a pretty wild story Mr Meeks

FENTON
Its the truth

Doyle looks at him and frowns

DOYLE
My other problem with this little
tale of yours is I cant see what
if anything it has to do with my
case

FENTON
Adam was the Gods hand killer
Hes the one youre looking for

DOYLE
Uh-huh He tell you that before he
asked you to take him to Tyler If
so you left that part out

FENTON

sheriff there is willing to forgive
and forget as long as you bring the
body and the ambulance back No one
wants to press charges

FENTON
(smiles)
Youve got to love small towns

DOYLE
Well Im not so sure the authorities
in Tyler will feel the same way about
you burying your brother in their
public garden

FENTON
Probably not

DOYLE
You know I get the distinct impression
that youre playing some kind of
game here with me

FENTON
Why is that

DOYLE
Why would you go through all that
trouble and then just walk in here
and confess it to me

FENTON
I did it because I promised Adam I
would Im here because I cant
live with what I know anymore

DOYLE
And what exactly do you know

Fenton nods to the picture of him and the woman

FENTON
That is your mother isnt it

Doyle glances at the picture and then looks at Fenton for a
long moment sizing him up

DOYLE
Yes it is
FENTON
I knew it You can tell by the eyes
DOYLE
Why are you so interested in my
picture
FENTON

Curiosity I guess Its the only
personal picture you have in here
No family portraits no snapshots of
kids just that one Why is that

DOYLE

I dont have a wife or kid Im too
busy for that

FENTON
Why not a more recent one of your
mother then

Doyle looks at the picture for a long moment a trace of
sadness in his expression

DOYLE
My mother died just a few weeks
after this picture was taken

your story Why do you think your
brother was the Gods Hand killer

The room slowly fills with light from an unseen source Dad
opens his eyes and sees the room washed with light A figure
comes out of the light moving slowly toward Dad

FENTON (V0) (CONTD)
A vision from God

The figure reaches the bed and Dad sees that it is a beautiful
ANGEL straight out of a Botticelli painting

FENTON (V0) (CONTD)

for our family

them for the final battle Its
being fought now but no one knows

it except us and others like us

The obvious answer was to tell someone
what he was planning but I couldnt
do that I loved him even if hed
gone crazy I had to save him from
himself If he thought it was God
that told him to do this awful thing
then I had to prove to him that it
wasnt God That it had to be the
devil So I studied the bible looking
for something to fight him with

DAD
Well before that angel came to me
I wasnt so sure I really believed
in God I just wasnt sure God
was something far away that didnt
exist everyday in my life or at least
I couldnt see it I went to church
more or less out of habit than for
spiritual reasons But now I know
I really know that God exists He
is here with us right now Were
beyond religion Weve got a direct
line to God

Does that mean we dont have to go
to church anymore

mine All kinds of gruesome stuff

was where all the real ammo was
When I found Jesus back there I knew
it was going to be alright I finally
had Dad beat

still believed Dad To him we were
knights of God on a holy mission to
abolish evil

the bodies of the six victims had
been found Is that true

Well in this case it does The first
victim was found mutilated with a

entire life Fenton

FENTON

‘Thats a lie and you know it

DAD

(sighs)
When God asked me to destroy demons
I had to trust Gods word that they
really were demons It was a question

of faith

Ive heard preachers call

it the leap of faith And I took

that leap I chose to believe
(beat)

And when I did that everything

flipped over And I ‘realized that

it was the right thing It was my

destiny

Fenton just looks at him

prayed for an angel to visit you

and points at the ground

DAD
I want you to dig a hole here Itll

in the sky Fenton digs the hole It is about five feet

wide and long but only about two feet deep There is a

small pile of dirt by the hole He is covered in sweat

FENTON (VO)
I started digging that goddamn hole

hated God I despised Him My hatred
helped me dig It kept me going
Dads or Gods or the angels or
whoevers plan it was would not work
on me I knew what Dad was doing

shirt is now off and tied around his head His back is
slightiy sunburned He is literally drenched in sweat The
hole is about three feet deep and about ten feet in length
and width Fenton digs steadily throwing dirt over his
shoulder into the ever growing pile by the hole

Fenton keeps digging lost in thought

ADAM (0S) (CONTD)

FENTON
I dont care what Dad said He might

hole

DAD (CONTD)
Aint exactly half but its
impressive Pretty smart way to do

Fenton climbs out of the hole with the shovel and starts to
dig at the edge of it to make it longer

them by the cracks of light in the

hatch door and Adams visits with

water My fear never lessened I

even pissed and shit myself because
I was too afraid to leave my little

spot by the stairs

DOYLE
Thats awful

FENTON
The hunger and the stink helped me
forget the fear for awhile but it
always came crashing back You would
have thought that I would have
eventually gotten over my fear of
the dark but I didnt I was
terrified the entire time I only
slept when I passed out from
exhaustion and fatigue

Fenton tries to stand but falls back down He lifts his
head up and looks Dad right in the eyes

FENTON

There is no God

Dad stands there for a long moment looking sadly at Fenton
He shuts the hatch and the light disappears into total
darkness The sound stops There is no light or sound at
all There is nothing but pitch black darkness

FENTON (V0O) (CONTD)
I lost count of the days after that
It felt like weeks I finally went
beyond fear into total insanity I
saw God He had finally sent me a
vision alright It was like that
line in Acts Immediately something
like scales fell from Sauls eyes
and he could see again And it was
then that I understood my destiny
just like Dad had said I would

There is a SPLASH sound and light from the opened hatch
falls on Fenton He is drenched and laughing hysterically
Dad is shaking him and calling his name

DOYLE
So no one ever knew about any of it

FENTON

FENTON
Do you mind if we just sit here for
awhile I dont feel like talking

They enter through a narrow gap in the chain link fence near
the back of the garden Fenton walks off through the wet
weeds to a small barely noticeable path Doyle follows
FENTON -
(as they walk)
Its a little further back this way
DOYLE
But this isnt even in the garden
He points to the garden in the distance where rosebushes are
lined up in neat symmetrical rows in front of the Rose Museum
FENTON
I said it was near the back
They continue to walk the garden proper disappearing behind
them as they enter a thicket of trees
DOYLE
You know you never told me what the
pen promise was The one you made to

Fenton looks over at him but keeps walking

FENTON
It was later that night

DISSOLVE TO FLASHBACK
EXT ROSE GARDEN -- NIGHT

Fenton digs a hole Adam sits on the ground next to Dads
corpse holding him and crying Fenton finishes digging the
hole and walks over to the corpse Adam looks up at him
angrily with tears in his eyes Fenton pulls Dad away from
Adam and drags him into the hole He picks up the shovel
and starts to fill the hole Adam stands over the hole
watching Dad being slowly covered with dirt

EXT ROSE GARDEN -- MOMENTS LATER

Fenton packs the dirt on the ground and then looks at Adam

Adam glares at him

ADAM

CUT TO PRESENT

EXT ROSE GARDEN -- MORNING -

Doyle and Fenton are still walking though the woods have
become thicker

DOYLE
I dont understand He promised you
that he would bury you here

FENTON
Thats right

DOYLE
(confused)
If he ever killed you

FENTON
Not killed Destroyed

DOYLE
Wait a minute

Doyle stops walking

DOYLE (CONTD)
That doesn’t make sense

Fenton stops and turns to him

FENTON
It does if the man in front of you
is Adam Meeks and not Fenton Meeks

DOYLE
confused
What

ADAM

You heard me It might take you a
few seconds but youll get it

Doyle stares at him for a moment and then goes for his gun
Adam stands calmly where he is watching him Doyle raises
the gun and levels it on him

DOYLE
still confused)
So youre the killer

ADAM
No I told you before Ive never
killed anyone in my life Fenton

was the killer -

DOYLE
Stop playing games and tell me the
truth

ADAM

The game is over Youll understand
soon Just let me show you where I
buried Fenton Were almost there

He points to a clearing up ahead Doyle looks unsure but
nods after a moment

DOYLE
You take it slow or I swear to God
Ill shoot you

Adam smiles at him and starts to slowly walk in the direction
of the clearing Doyle follows keeping the gun aimed at
him They reach the large clearing where a few giant
rosebushes stand

ADAM
This is it This is the spot

There are literally dozens and dozens of spots on the ground
where the grass has been uprooted and holes have been dug
and filled in The covered holes are all in little clusters
of threes Adam points to one of the fresher clusters where
a shovel lays next to it

ADAM (CONTD)
Thats where I buried him

Doyle studies the ground
DOYLE

Theres too many holes here There
were only six victims

oO
It

ADAM
Gods work is never done Fenton
didnt bury his victims here He
kept them as trophies in his basement
This is where I put demons

Doyle looks at him but Adam stares at Fentons three graves

ADAM (CONTD)
That night I went to Fentons house
was the first time I had seen him
since we were kids I didnt even
know he lived so close to me until
he showed up on my list

CUT TO FLASHBACK
EXT FENTONS HOUSE (PREVIOUSLY ADAMS HOUSE) -- NIGHT

It is the same house from the very beginning All the lights
to the house are off except for a dim light in the front
window Johnny Cashs Peace in the Valley plays softly from
inside the house Adam stands in the driveway holding a
lead pipe in his gloved hand looking at the house

INT FENTONS HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Fenton (previously Adam) sits at a small desk in the corner
of the living room typing on an old typewriter The song
plays on an old record player on the other side of the room
He hums along with it as he types On ‘the desk there are
two stacks of paper Taped to the wall in front of the desk
are several newspaper clippings from the Gods Hand case and
a single piece of paper with seven names on it six of them
crossed out Fenton pulls the piece of paper out of the
typewriter puts it on top of one of the stacks of paper
takes another sheet from the other stack puts it in the
typewriter and starts to type again

ADAM (05S)
Fenton Meeks

Fenton whirls around barely in time to see Adam bringing the
pipe down on his head

INT FENTONS HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Fenton lays on the floor with his hands and feet taped

There is a trickle of blood on his forehead Adam leans on
the desk the axe next to him watching him Fenton opens
his eyes dazed tries to move but cant He looks around
and sees Adam He looks at him for a long moment

ato

FENTON
So you finally came for me

ADAM
God finally came for you

FENTON
I knew this day would come

ADAM
Ive prayed for the past twenty years
that it wouldnt but I guess I knew
it too

FENTON
Dad would be so proud of you You
always were his favorite You even
look kind of like him you know it

ADAM
(not looking at him)
Why did you leave the notes

FENTON
To lure you to me and get this whole
thing over with once and for all I
just couldnt take it anymore I
like to be the hunter not the hunted
I knew when those killings made the
news youd track me down I have
to admit though I didnt expect you
to wait so long Six people You
let six people die before you came
after me

ADAM
I came only when God put you on my
jist To come before then would
have been murder

FENTON
You might call it something else
but youre a murderer just like me
The only difference is you kill for
God and I kill because I like it
The look in their eyes as they die
the way the blood feels on my flesh
It makes me feel good

ADAM
Did killing Dad make you feel good

FENTON
(half sings)
It put that joy joy joy joy down in
a my heart

i Adam looks away from him fighting his emotions

FENTON (CONTD)
Cmon Adam youre supposed to say
where remember

Adam pulls off one of his gloves

FENTON (CONTD)
I guess thats not your favorite
song anymore

Fenton looks at Adams bare hand and smiles sadistically

FENTON (CONTD)
Remember the look in Dads eyes that
night

ADAM
Yeah I remember

Adam takes off his other glove and tosses them both down on
the desk Fenton watches him

FENTON

I should have killed you when I first
got to town but that was too easy
I had to have you come for me

(laughs bitterly)
I guess I forgot that God protects
you But he didnt protect all those
people I killed in the past twenty
years And he sure didnt protect
Dad did he

Adam walks around Fenton takes a roll of tape out of his
pocket and tears off a big piece

God asked Dad to destroy his own son
much like he asked Isaac to sacrifice
his own son to test his faith But
Dad couldnt do it He loved his
son demon or not

He reaches down and slaps the tape on Fentons mouth

ADAM (CONTD)
He simply could not do what God had
asked of him

Oy He walks to the desk and picks up the axe

ADAM (CONTD)
And God didnt take pity on Dad like
he did with Isaac
He walks back over to Fenton and looks him right in the eye
ADAM (CONTD)
But that was back at a time when God
had pity
Adam reaches a hand out toward him

about you

ADAM

disgust

DOYLE
