evil looking rifle slung over his shoulder As he swaggers towards the
base of the statue he peels off his wetsuit to reveal yet another gaudy
COSTUME underneath

Superhero 4 THE COMEDIAN He pins a BADGE to his leather breastplate
incongruously its a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON - and it matches his own nasty
smile as he marches forward into battle
INT BASE OF STATUE - THAT MOMENT - DAY

A TRIO OF TERRORISTS are standing guard near the entrance at the base
of the statue Theyre holding a JANITOR at gunpoint One of them

Panic The three TERRORISTS fall into a tight cluster at the base of a
long metal stairway One of them grabs the JANITOR and holds a gun to
his head

The CCMEDIAN strikes a pose and scratches his chin

COMEDIAN
Thats amusing

TERRORIST I

The COMEDIAN shrugs okay He lifts his rifle and fires TWO SILENCED SHOTS
directly into the JANITOR’s gut The old mans body jerks twice and he
slumps to the floor stone dead

COMEDIAN
Hows that for lateral thinking

The TERRORISTS stand there appalled For an instant theyre too stunned
to shoot The COMEDIAN begins to laugh and then stops and looks at them

sense of humour

TERRORISTS

TADE THROUGH TO

EXT STREET EVENING

A ramshackle news kiosk The OWNER fat and stubbly sits framed by
the garish covers of comic books and nudie magazines staring at the
high-rise across the street One of his magazines Nova Express has
a picture of Richard Nixon on the front cover and the headline HOW
SICK IS DICK AFTER 3RD HEART-OP

Adjacent to the kiosk is a wall on which is fastened a yellow and black
nuclear warning sign and the words FALLCUT SHELTER Beneath this sign

a SMALL BLACK KID is sitting reading a comic dook Beside nim is 4 solise
poster bearing an artists impression of RORSCHACH with WANTED printed
across the top of it and a list of particulars underneath with an offer
of reward for information THE CAMERA closes in tightly on the poster

RORSCHACH (VO)
(quiet harsh monotone)
My picture Bad likeness This city
is afraid of me I see its true face

Across the street three police cars oddly truncated bubble-snaped
vehicles recognizable from the flashing red beacons on their roofs
sit on the curb amid a throng of ONLOOKERS

A red haired STREET CRAZYwearing a tatty raincoat and carrying a placard
reading THE END IS NIGH picks up a copy of the New York Gazette NEW

NEW VENDOR (CONTD)

Depressed by all this bad news Twenny-five

Across the street a PLAINCLOTHES COP takes a statement from the DOORMAN
of a high-rise block as PEDESTRIANS clustering around a NYPD cordon
stare with sickened expressions at a gruesome mess on the sidewalk

PATROLMAN
STAND BACK MOVE ALONG

We are not in New York as we know it in this strange offshoot of
veality everything - the clothes the cars tne very look of the city -
seems just a touch off The PATROLMAN for instance his standard-issue
uniform consists of full riot gear and his plastisteel breastplate is
festooned with heavy artillery He clears a path for a squad of
PARAMEDICS as they lift a bloody parcel onto a stretcher and move towards
a waiting ambulance Berore they have reached the ambulance their path
is crossed by the placard bearing STREET CRAZY As they stop to avoid
him something falls from the stretcher and rolls into the gutter

Nobody on the scene appears to notice this

THE CAMERA follows whatever fell from the stretcher and closes in to
show a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON A tiny diagonal fleck of BLOOD stains its
surface like the hand of a clock poised at twelve minutes to midnight

Rorschachs monologue has been running throughout the above scene

RORSCHACH (V0)

The streets are extended gutters and
Che gutters are full of blood when the
drains finally seab over all vermin will
drown The accumulated filth and all their
sex and murder will foam up about their waists
and all the whores and politicians will look
up and shout save us and Ill look down
and whisper na They had a choice all
of them Now the whole world on the brink
Staring down into bloody hell all those
liberals and intellectuals and smooth-talkers
and all of a sudden nobody can think of anything
to say

Towards the end of the monologue THE CAMERA begins to pull back from
the HAPPY-FACE BUTTON It rises above the heads of the CROWD in the
street and continues to climb twenty stories up the side of the high-
rise revealing more of the geography below as it does so Eventually
it stops just above a broken window A MAN witn a bald patch on the
top of his head is peering out of the broken window and down into the
street Rorschachs monologue comes to an end

INT HIGH-RISE APARTMENT NIGHT

Blakes wrecked apartment is illuminated by moonlignt flooding through

the broken window A small metal object is sitting on the lower part

of the steel frame which contained the now smashed wincew This obdject

is moving sligntly and making scraping noises against tne frame Cn
closer examination this object is shown to be a grappling-hook Attached
to the hook is a taut wire which leads down on the outside of the building
The wire is moving slightly from side to side As we watch this curious
phenomenon the shadowy figure of a MAN appears from below hauling nimsel
up the wire He reaches the broken window climbs through and sits on the
frame surveying tne room He is wearing a tatty trenchcoat and a narrow-
brimmed hat As ne looks up we see that his face is covered with a soft
white mask on wnicn black viscous blobs move around creating a non-stop
kaleidoscope of symmetrical patterns

RORSCHACH takes something from his pocket and examines it closely

We see that he is holding the blood stained HAPPY-FACE BUTTON in his
gloved hand He wipes the surface of the button but the congealed blood
doesnt move He puts the button back in his pocket takes out a flash-

RORSCHACHs flashlight beam shines across rumpled bedclothes searches
around the walls and settles finally on the half-open door to a walk-in
closet RORSCHACH steps inside examines rack upon rack of expensive
suits

He shoves the suits aside Then mysteriously he begins to pound on tne
wall with his fist moving left right up down

He pauses Hes found a hollow section He feels his way carefully along
the seams of the wall and floorboard until he discovers a concealed trigger
He presses it and a panel slides back revealing a second secret closet
nidden inside the first

He reaches up flicks on a light Inside the secret closet a bizarre
uniform - helmet mask and gloves a gaudy-coloured bodysuit rows of
exotic weaponry On the wall nearby hangs a dusty framed photograph

RORSCHACH examines the photo Its a group shot six men and one woman
all dressed in garish uniforms The man in the centre is wearing the

and produces a bunch of keys but on getting closer to the door he sees

‘of The Comedians door) DREIBERG is dismayed He glances fearfully up
and down the street before cautiously pushing open the door and entering
the building

INT DREIBERGS HALLWAY - NIGHT

The hallway is in darkness but light is streaming from the edges of a

peers into the room beyond

RORSCHACH opens 2 bottle of CLEANING FLUID stuffs a wad of newspaper into

makes it into the xitcnen just as he IGNITES his molotov cocktail and

TCSSES IT INSIDE

The COPS pitch backwards as the bottle blows up By the time they hit the

gently stroking his hair

INT TENEMENT - BACK STAIRWELL THAT MOMENT (MOS)

RORSCHACH huddled on the uppermost landing just below roof level By

are fighting their way through the inferno still on his tail

He still has his mop bucket its half-full of water He reaches for nis
last can a can of DRANO and empties into the bucket where it begins to
HISS and SIZZLE

Sposin I should say for you I yearn

Would you think Im speaking out of turn

The COPS are almost on him racing upwards two steps at a time He steps
out in front of them and - before they can hoist their weapons - HEAVES
THE BUCKETFUL OF S0ILING DRANO into their faces

The COPS SHRIEK SOUNDLESSLY and topple backwards into the flames as
RORSCHACH turns tail and bursts through the door to the roof

TENEMENT 20CF - A MOMENT LATE

RORSCHACH emerges - and a BLINDING LIGHT catches him full in the face
Hovering not twenty feet overhead is a POLICE AIRSHIP A spray of MACHINE-
GUN FIRE peppers the roof

Sposin I declare it
Would you take my love and share it

RORSCHACH scuttles along the edge of the roof finds a rickety FIRE
ESCAPE and dives over Unfortunately hes now exposed on tne front of
the building - pinned to the wall by gunfire from the SWAT TEAM on the
street TONGUES OF FLAME dart from nearby windows He turns and tries

cto olimb back up cut more COPS from the just landed AITRSHIr gre already

Four stories down a FAT COP is holding a megaphone and scanning the
rooftops He sees RORSCHACH plummeting towards him but is too fat to
dodge out of the way RORSCHACH lands right on top of him flattening nim
to the sidewalk The CTU COPS leap on RORSCHACH instantly kicking him
and pummelling him with billy clubs and rifle butts

announcing the end of the world

He kicks and claws at the COPS as they drag him unceremoniously off to
a nearby van

INT XARNAK - DINING YALL - NIGHT

VEIDT alone at a long table in his cavernous dining hall calmly eating
dinner Behind him above the mammoth entry doors hangs a TAPESTRY -
Alexander slicing through the Gordian Knot

TwO BATTERED FIGURES creep silently into the hall

VEIDT sits at the table betraying nothing At his side the MUTANT LYNX
growls VEIDTs hand closes tightly around the scruff of the animals
neck quiet girl

RORSCHACH reaches into his trenchcoat and pulls out a RHODOPSIN FLASHER -
the same weapon CAPTAIN METROPOLIS used in the opening scene Suddeniy

RORSCHACH

VEIOT

YEIDT whirls He flings a platter frisbee-style across the nail

It catches RORSCHACH on the chin and sends him sprawling DREIBERG

backs against a wall as the LYNX comes sprinting towards him teeth bared
VEIDT claps his hands twice and the CAT obediently stops VEIDT gets uo

‘and approaches DREIBERG and RORSCHACH

DREIBERG
Adrian Did you kill the Comedian
VEIDT
He was threatening to wreck my work
DREIBERG
Jesus Your work
VEFDT
(smiles)

Come Ill show you You can watch me
save the world

INT KARNAK A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

VEIDT is walking calmly through the halls of Karnak The LYNX is
beside him RORSCHACH and DREIBERG are following a few paces behind
RORSCHACH tries to get close to VEIDT and grab him but is prevented
by the LYNX which turns and makes a warning growl RORSCHACH drops
back to rejoin DREIBERC

VEIDT
The Comedian suspected the Soviets were
up to something - he stumbled on my Pacific
research base but then he figured it was me
He was furious Naturally being the Comedian
he assumed my intention to engineer World War
Three was intended as a monumental joke
He couldnt tolerate the idea that I might
get the biggest indeed the last laugh
I assure you thats what really annoyed him
I had to get rid of him The rest of it -
Rorschachs capture my assassination that
was just to keep you busy All that really
mattered was getting rid or Dr Mannattan

DREIBERG
What

VEIDT
His absence was essential to the outbreak of
war

RORSCHACH
You started a world war

VEIDT
I merely hastened the inevitable

(smiling)

Shes been ready to blow for years I knew

all it would take was a little pusn So

IT upset Manhattan by giving a few of his
colleagues cancer and pointing the finger at
him Curious how sensitive he can be - for
such a cold blue fish

RORSCHACH
Call off the cat Veidt and Ill kill you

VEIDT
(calmly)
Before you do that you might care to look
at the fruit of my labours

INT - INFORMATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

VEIDT points them over to the monitor in the bottom right-hand corner
Onscreen the young JON OSTERMAN sits in an Arizona test lab reassembling

a WATCH

DREIBERG
What is this It looks like Jon

VEIDT
Tt is Jon Twenty-four years ago 8efore
ne turned into Dr Manhattan

DREIBERG
Good Lord Howd you get it on tape
VEIDT
Its not on tape ts live Were watching

it happen
CUT TO
256 EXT OUTER SPACE -TYAT MOMENT

DR MANHATTAN and LAURIE in a Dubble of oxygen materialize in orbit
around the earth Far below the nuclear birds are already reaching
their destinations Flashes of light occur over New York and San
Francisco followed oy spreading mushroom clouds

LAURIE
(terrified)
Those flasnes of light Were too late

DR MANHATTAN
Lets take a look

CUT TO
257 EXT ZCWNTCWN - 2CST SCMB - NIGHT

CLOSE UP on DR MANHATTAN and LAURIE who appear in their cubble
surrounded by swirling smoke and dust LAURIE travel-sick as usual
segins ta retch As she does so she glances up and sees something
wnich makes her eyes widen and wnaica causes her to be really sick

THE CAMERA pulls back to reveal what LAURIE has seen Acres of burning

rubble recede into the distance Blackenedcharredbodies protrude from
piles’ of bricks smashed concrete and twisted metal A shattered CLOCK-
TOWER shows the remains of a clock the hands of which have been welded

to the face at midnight the time of the blast

In the foreground freakishly still standing and just about recognizable
is whats left of the NEWS KIOSK A low section of wall remains behind it
Onto this has been burnt the silhouette shadows of the NEWSVENDOR and

the BLACK KID

LAURIE is sobbing hysterically

DR MANHATTAN
Im sorry I shouldnt have brought you
here
(puzzled)

Strange Theres something Times
flowing backwards

LAURTE collapses into DR MANHATTANs arms

LAURIE
Jon please

DR MANHATTAN
The South Pole

They dematerialize in the swirling smoke

MIX TO
INT KARNAK LAB AREA - NIGHT

A VORTEX OF SNOW-FLAKES THE CAMERA pulls back from a window out of
wnich weve been looking into the night As we move oack from the
window we see reflected by it a GLOWING BLUE DOME surrounded by

a mass of whirring machinery

YEIDT DREIBERG and RORSCHACH enter the lab and approach the SLUE DCME
a BUBBLE OF PURE ENERGY

Inside its shimmering contours is a little corner cf the Arizona Test
Base JON OSTERMAN tightens a screw and sets the movement of JANEYs
watch into its housing - totally oblivious to the strange trio watching
him from twenty-four years in the future

VEIDT
Gentlemen the past Unfolding before your
eyes
(pause)
Stand back from the field Itll blow yeu
to dits
DREIBERG

What is it How does it work

VEIDT
Its a taehyon chamber It generates suratcmic
particles which flow backward in time
(smiling)
There are other worlds Daniel other timelines --
existing parallel to our own --

DREIBERG
Adrian youve lost it

VEIDT
(pointing to the tachyon chamber)
Ive seen them Ive seen them in there
(pause)
In some of them - only a few the human
race survives And it survives because
Dr Manhattan never existed

He moves closer to the tachyon bubble Off to one side is the camera
which feeds to the monitor in the video room - and beside it mounted on
a tripod is a high-powered TELESCOPIC RIFLE

VEIDT (CONTD)

The creation of Dr Manhattan threw the world
balance of power totally out of whack Hig
absence - even fora week - virtually guaranteed
a catastrophic war -- Now do you see what Im
going to do Im going to change the past --
And the neat thing is - this life-saving event
is made possible by harnessing the energy from
thousands of nuclear explosions happening all

- over the Northern Hemisphere Veidt Industries
has an office with a receptor-transmitter in every
major city You wouldnt believe the cost

(smiling)

And yes I do hold the patent

DREIBERG
(numbed )
Youve destroyed the world to save it

VEIDT
(smiling)
You can see why the Comedian was jealous

VEIDT turns to the tachyon chamber Inside JON OSTERMAN fits the glass
erystal back into place on JANEYs watch VEIDT looks on in fascination

VEIDT (CONTD)
To begin with I could only watch the past
Today we can reach out and touch it

He steps over to the rifle and peers through its telescopic sight

VEIDT (CONTD)
(turning to face them)
In a minute Ill open a small hole in the
bubble Then Ill put a bullet through it
straight into Jon Ostermans neart and
Dr Manhattan will never be born

RORSCHACH
And they call me a fucking nut

DREIBERG
Adrian Its too late The worlds
blowing up as we stand here

VEIDT
(very patiently)
Daniel if I kill Jon in the past none
of this will happen We wont even be
here will we

DREIBERG
And what if youre wrong

VEIDT
Im not

DREIBERG

VEIDT
Tnen Ill just have to apologize and do five
million years community service Christ
(shouting)
Im doing what I have to do to save the
godforsaken human race

VEIDT turns to the tachyon chamber Inside twenty-four years ago
JON OSTERMAN is packing his jewelers tools folding his swateh of
black velvet

VEIDT (CONTD)
Your problem Dan is lack of vision
You spent all those years chasing after
muggers and drug dealers and jaywaikers
as if tne world was any better for it
As if any of it mattered

DREIBERG
You ruthless son of a bitch You really
believe this mad-scientist bullshit is
going to save the world

VEIDT
Wed better hope so -- Its almost time

Ye «icks a floor switeh Giant generators begin to num VEIDT sends
over tne rifle and peers tnreugh the signt

VETOTS CV - THRCUCH CROSSHAIRS

In the past JON OSTERMAN has entered the Intrinsic Field Centre and is
about to step into the test chamber

‘INT KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT

A LUMINESCENT WHITE SPOT appears on the surface of the tachyon bubble
Theres a hideous WHINE as a tiny HOLE begins to open up - DIRECTLY
IN FRONT OF VEIDTS RIFLE His finger closes around the trigger

and with a TERRIBLE CRASH the LAB WALL COLLAPSES BEHIND HIM
VEIDT DIVES BACKWARD DODGING RUBBLE

-» aS a BLUE GIANT THIRTY FEET TALL steps into the lab - with LAURIE
at his side

DR MANHATTAN
VEIDT

VEIDT
Jon Get back You dont understand

DR MANHATTAN stares down at the TACHYON BUBBLE and sees himself --
his former self -- in the IF chamber at the Arizona Test dase
His eyes go wide Even hes surprised

In the ensuing panic RORSCHACH dives at VEIDT YEIOT manages to sidesteo
him frantically trying to get to his rifle The HOLE IN THE BUBBLE has
grown te the size of a quarter VETDT lunges toward tie rifle

LAURIEs directly in nis path He shoves her aside they grapple he
flings her to the ground pulls a stun gun from under his cloak and

points it at her

and a millisecond later hes aiming at NOTHING OR MANHATTAN has
instantaneously TELEPORTED LAURIE across the room out of his line of
fire

YEIDT looks up in horror just in time to see a BLUE S80LT CF LIGHTNING
launching itself from OR MANHATTANs outstretched finger --

VEIDT
NOrt

-- and in the wink of an eye he’s VAPORIZED All thats left is a pair
of CHARRED BOOTS still standing upright

DREIBERG rushes over to LAURIE and takes her in his arms

LAURIE
What was he doing
OREIBERG
Trying to change the past He sala it was

he only way to save the world

LAURTE
(breaking dawn)
Its too late

DR MANHATTAN stares at the TACHYQN BUBBLE mesmerized Inside the door
(to the IF chamber has just swung SHUT on a terrified JON OSTERMAN

DR MANHATTAN
He was right

RORSCHACH LAURIE and DREIBERG stare up at the blue behemoth in puzzlement
DR MANHATTAN begins to SHRINK to normal size He runs his hands over the
surface of the tachyon bubble BRIGHT BLUE SPARKS shoot off in all
directions

DR MANHATTAN (CONTD)
He did it Veidt broke the code Its so
elegant Its so obvious
- 109

DR MANHATTANs off in another world as usual He wears a BEATIFIC
SMILE as ne watches his own imminent destruction in the tachyon chamber

LAURTE
Jon

DR MANHATTAN
Space and time I finally understand Laurie
I see it all now

RORSCHACH
Uh huh

DR MANHATTAN
I see what the watchmaker made I see the
universe

He lifts his arms PARTICLES OF LIGHT appear from nowhere and whiz
around his body like superaccelerated firéflies The lights in the
room dim Its as if DR MANHATTAN is absorbing all the power of the
world into his own massive frame

DR MANHATTAN
My work here is finisned

The others cower They sense that something large is about to happen
In the past JON OSTERMAN is pounding on the glass of the test chamber
In the present DR MANHATTAN reaches out to touch the tiny hole in time

He does and in a BLAZE of BLINDING BLUE LIGHT the tiny rift EXPANDS
into a SHIMMERING FISSURE DR MANHATTAN PEELS SACK ITS EDGES AND STEPS
THROUGH INTO THE PAST

INT TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT

JON OSTERMAN turns away from the observation panel To his utter
ocewilderment a HUGE BLUE FIGURE - surrounded by sparks and smiling
gloriously - has materialized in the chamber behind nim JCN cant
speak he can only gape in disbelief

DR MANHATTAN
Dont be afraid Jon Ill be with you

A second before the particle cannons kick in DR MANHATTAN steps forward
and FUSES WITH JON their bodies becoming one -

For a moment JON is still visible with DR MANHATTANs frame surrounding
him like a translucent shield of pure energy OR MANHATTAN then
coalesces into a solid protective HUSK around him As the chamber begins
to glow a network of HAIRLINE CRACKS spreads across the shell of his

body BLUE LIGHT spills through the seams He spreads his hands not

in pain but in triumph - and with a blinding FLASH DR MANHATTAN explodes
outward a million fragments merging with nothingness

«to expose a dumbstruck JON OSTERMAN in his place The blue light dims
and the chamber reverts to normal Miraculously hes alive - agtonished
but perfectly intact

INT ARIZONA TEST LAB - A MOMENT LATER

The timelock door pops open and JON staggers out into the midst of his
awed colleagues whove seen everything through the observation panel

DR GLASS
What in the name of God

The SCIENTISTS advance cautiously toward the chamber JANEY sobbing
cushes forward and throws her arms around the dazed JON As she clings
to him her face pressed tightly against his chest ne looks down at his
hands his fist is still closed around

JON
Your watch Janey I fixed your watch

SCIENTIST
LOOK

The SCIENTIST is staring wide-eyed at the rear of the chamber which
isnt there Instead theres a rigpling irregular RUPTURE -- a pulsating

HOLE IN TIME -- and visible beyend it are three odd-looking and very

frightened figures DREIBERG LAURIE and RORSCHACH

REVERSE ANGLE VEIDTS LAB - THE PRESENT

DREIBERG LAURIE and RORSCHACH stare THROUGH the rupture at the astonished

SCIENTISTS
” LAURIE
What happened

CRETEERG
He saved himself He changed the past

LAURIE
where did he go

Before DREIBERG can suggest an answer the cleft in time begins to THROB
and SHIMMER slowly SEALING ITSELF OFF before their eyes For a noment
everythings back to normal

» and then to their mounting horror the room theyre in begins to
DISSOLVE AROUND THEMFADING AWAY INTO A BLANK WHITE VOID

A sudden percussive POP The white void seems to shrivel around them
collapsing into a protective bubble of force as they plunge into

EXT VORTEX EFFECT

DREIBERG LAURIE and RORSCHACH spinning and tumbling through an other-
dimensional funhouse of sound and color If space and time could be
compressed into a single extravagant E-ticket joyride this would be it
Their bodies contract and distend warp and elongate their tortured
mouths emit soundless shrieks and then before they know it they find
themselves deposited

EXT NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT

smack in the middle of a busy intersection The three of them
materialize from nowhere a southbound VAN swerves ‘Oo avoid them slamming
into a row of parked cars and a northbound TAXICAB does the same knocking
over a fire hydrant

LAURIE
Dan is this is this New York

DREIBERG
Those cars What year is this

LAURIE
Everythings changed

Its a disorienting world theyve landed in In fact its our world
cur New York and everything the cars the clothing the very look
of the city seems just a trifle out of whack

RORSCHACH
Hnrrrr we never happened

BYSTANDERS begin to cluster about laughing and taunting highly amused by
the obvious puzzlement of the gaudily-outfitted trio in their midst

There are of course no costumed heroes in our world and their sudden
presence prompts a virtual Babel of speculation among the onlookers Nuts
Fruits Out-of-werk actors

RORSCHACH takes a swing at one of the curious who gets a touch too close
and the mood begins to turn hostile The CROWD now grown to several
dozen cecple is threatening to bleck the intersection altogether

a MOUNTED POLICEMAN rides up on his stallion and blows a shrill WHISTLE

DREIBERG
Cops on norses Is that past or future

RORSCHACH
(drily)
Both

EXT NEWSSTAND - THAT MOMENT

The same newsstand weve seen all along but luckily here in our world
the headlines are only mildly discouraging RUSSIAN SUMMIT TALKS COLLAPSE
Like everyone else our old friend the NEWS VENDOR is gaping at the ruckus
on the street

NEWS VENDOR
Jesus Christ it aint Halloween is it

His sidekick the SMALL BLACK KID who reads comic books points to the
befuddled trio on the street and LAUGHS in gleeful recognition

KID
Shit man Its Rorschach And Night Owl

NEWS VENDOR
What ytalkin about

KID
Superheroes Check it out

He thrusts a COMIC BOOK into the NEWS VENDORs hand and races off to join
the growing throng of rubberneckers The NEWS VENDOR stares down at the
costumed characters in the comic book - WATCHMEN - then throws a
cockeyed squint at their real-life counterparts on the street

EXT STREET - THAT MOMENT - NICHT

HORNES BLARE ALL TRAFFIC HAS STOPPED The intersection is mobbed with
curious ONLOOKERS By now a half-dozen SEAT COPS have arrived to clear
the streets and restore order

cop I
Break it up Stand back

cop IT
Come on you three If this is some kind
of publicity stunt

DREIBERG LAURIE and RORSCHACH nave fallen into a tight circle back to
back They dont know what to expect and theyre poised for a brawl
The taunting crowd gives them plenty of room even the COPS are hesitant
to advance

LAURTE
Dan what do we do now

DRETBERC
(panicked)
Wherever we are its better than what we left
Backs together

LAURIE
How the nell can we explain
Theyre not going to believe us are they

RORSCHACH
Theyd better

And on RORSCHACHs final vicious HISS we SHOCK CUT TO BLACK and
FADE OUT

THE END
