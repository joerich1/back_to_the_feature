THE EGYPTIAN

FADE IN

EXT A DESOLATE SPOT ON THE WESTERN SHORE OF THE RED SEA -
oye EARLY MORNING (THE ERA IS THE 1TH CENTURY
BC

The scene is introduced by the blowing of desert sand
When it clears we are on a very long shot toward the sea
On the shore of the sea there is a small and simple
Egyptian house with a smaller outbuilding There is the
suggestion of movement there as if there are people but
what this movement is cant be distinguished for at this
distance the house itself seems a tiny thing in the midst
of a vast desolation The brassy waters of the sea
stretch endlessly For the rest there is only empty
desert and a circle of dry red hills We hear the lonely
howl of a jackal then -

OLD SINUHES VOICE
On the surface of the earth there is
no more desolate spot than this

EXT HOUSE - MOVING SHOT TO OLD SINUHE ON PORCH - EARLY
MORNING

Camera goes along with a small whirlwind which beginning
out of nowhere whirls past the house where camera stops
It is a simple house made of mud bricks its formerly
bright colors faded and weather-beaten In the shade of
a small entrance porch SINUHE is seated He is 95 years
old He is writing on a scroll of papyrus which runs
across his knees It seems that he has written much and
has little left to write for the roll of completed manu-
script on his left hand is large and the roll on his
right hand is small The passing of the small whirlwind
disturbs him hardly at all as he bends over his scroll

CLOSE SHOT - PORTION OF SINUHE AND PAPYRUS SCROLL - EARLY
MORNING

He writes in Egyptian hieroglyphics The hands which
make the marks are cramped and wrinkled the marks they
make are clear and incisive - the marks of a man whose
thinking has crystallized into knowledge As he writes -

OLD SINUHE
I - Sinuhe the Egyptian write this -

OLD SINUHE
- the last chapter

He stops writing for a moment looks up and we see his
eyes As a dying fire retains a heart of glowing coals
so does this man preserve in these eyes the fire of his
dying life -- remarkable eyes which are sometimes alert
with intelligence calm with resigned philosophy spar-
kling with mature and ironic humor or touched with pain
He looks at the desert the hills the sea bendsover to
write

5 EXT SHORE OF THE RED SEA - MOOD SHOT - EARLY MORNING
Brassy water Alkaline sand Sparse vegetation

OLD SINUHES VOICE
Before me stretch the brassy waters of
the Red Sea

6 EXT DESERT AND CIRCLE OF HILLS - MOOD SHOT - EARLY
MORNING

An Egyptian monument of some sort half crumbled into
dust shows in the distance

OLD SINUHES VOICE
Around me are the ancient dry hills
and desert

7 ANGLE PAST PORTION OF HOUSE TO OUTBUILDING SOLDIERS -
EARLY MORNING

Near the small outbuilding four Egyptian SOLDIERS are
relieving their boredom by hurling spears at a post tar-
get Midway between outbuilding and house are boundary
stones

OLD SINUHES VOICE
Boundary stones mark the limits of my
dwelling place Those are my guards -
IT am in exile

8 EXT PORCH OF HOUSE - OLD SINUHE AND SOLDIERS EARLY
MORNING

for a moment looks over to the guards then bending over
his task again -

OLD SINUHE
How can it be that a man ends his life
in such a fashion I who am called
He Who Is Alone am writing this --

EXT SAND NEARBY A PAIR OF LIZARDS - EARLY MORNING

are listening to the sound of Sinuhes voice their heads
cocked their shiny eyes blinking

OLD SINUHES VOICE
that some day it may be dug from
Egypts sands and read

OLD SINUHE - EARLY MORNING

He looks up from his work considering the possibility of
this last thought half in hope half in doubt Then he
sees the lizards and his expression alters He is not
surprised to see them and smiles at them as friends

OLD SINUHE
But who knows what tomorrow will
bring I am very old and I may
never finish eh

LIZARDS - EARLY MORNING

The original pair their heads cocked as they listen to
Sinuhe Two or three more run in

OLD SINUHE - EARLY MORNING

For a moment leans back wiping weariness from his eyes
Then an idea striking him he looks at the lizards
again

OLD SINUHE
Ill tell my story to you --

LIZARDS - EARLY MORNING

perk up Their beady eyes give them an air of being
raptly interested

OLD SINUHES VOICE
- my only companions now

OLD SINUHRE - EARLY MORNING
smiles in a rather odd way -

OLD SINUHE
(with just a trace of
bitterness in humor)
You have learned not to shun me - you
listen when I speak

Then warming to his idea he begins to unroll the papyrus
scroll slowly backward

EXT SECTION OF THEBES - AT A BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION
WORKMEN SLAVES OVERSEERS SINUHE - DAY

The building is being erected of great limestone blocks
We see ordinary WORKMEN who shape the stone with crude
instruments and set the stones in place - but the focus
of interest is a great sledge on which a huge block of
stone is being transported Forty SLAVES hitched like
oxen to the sledge are trying to pull it up a wet-sanded
ramp OVERSEERS who carry staffs as tall as themselves
do not hesitate to belabor the backs of the salves
Sinuhe dressed in the clothing of a physician stands
watching

OLD SINUHES VOICE
For every free man there were a
hundred in bondage

One of the slaves drops senseless to the ground from
starvation and exhaustion Sinuhe walks to him

CLOSER ANGLE - SINUHE SLAVE AND GROUP - DAY

Sinuhe bends over the slave examines him He pushes
back his eyelids looks into dead eyes He rises shakes
his head at those who have gathered around There is no
expression of horror on Sinuhes face -- this is the
daily life of these people not an isolated incident
Camera pulls back to widen angle as an indifferent
Overseer shrugs whacks the harness of the dead slave
free with the slash of a large knife Another Overseer
raising his staff -

Ho

slaves who struggle pant and sweat again

EXT PORTICO AND GARDEN OF A NOBLE - SINUHE A NOBLE
HIS WIFE A SYRIAN SLAVE MERCHANT SLAVES FOR SALE
HOUSEHOLD SLAVES ENTERTAINERS - DAY

(For a portion of general atmosphere see NATL GEOGRAPHIC
Oct 1941 p 464) Under a portico facing a garden a
NOBLE lies on a bed He is fat and wealthy and his body
glistens with oil He has a swollen gouty foot which
rests on a cushion on the floor Sinuhe kneeling there
is bleeding him using the instrument of his time of
copper and stone Nearby is the small wooden portable
box in which he carries his instruments and medicines
Sinuhe also observes the scene A SYRIAN SLAVE MERCHANT
unctuous and fawning is offering for the inspection of
the Noble a string of WOMEN SLAVES These slaves are of
all ages countries colors of skin - and the action of
the selling goes like this As the merchant brings the
women and girls forward for inspection they arrive in
such a way that we see their faces can judge their
nationalities beauty or lack of it their ages But

as they are presented to the Noble their backs are to
camera Before the Noble they lift aside their garments
so that he may inspect them as one would cattle The
Noble indicates with a gesture of his ivory-handled fly-
whisk his decision All who are presented at the opening
of this scene the Noble waves away with indifference
Seated beside the Nobles bed in a chair is the NOBLES
WIFE a haughty proud indifferent woman dressed in
formal wig much rich jewelry the finest dress If she

pays any attention at all to the business between her
husband the salve dealer and the women it is no more
than to give a momentary and indifferent glance She
cools herself with a revolving fan and her haughty look
is directed for the most part to the garden where some
entertainment is being staged There two WRESTLERS

one black one white are engaged in a match HOUSEHOLD
SLAVES and HOUSEHOLD OFFICERS watch Other ENTERTAINERS
including a group of semi-nude DANCING GIRLS wait their
turn to attempt to relieve the ladys boredom

OLD SINUHES VOICE
Though a man might have but one wife
he could own as many women as he could
afford

Camera moves forward to a tighter scene at the Nobles
bed The next slaves are hardly more than children
girls of no more than thirteen fair of face and figure
As they display themselves before the Noble his eyes at
last glisten with interest and desire

OLD SINUHES VOICE
There was no word in our language mean-
ing sin

The Noble tosses some money silver rings - on the floor
The Merchant scrambles for them greedily The Noble
motions the new slaves to come closer Sinuhe as if by
accident but not by accident drops his medicine chest
on the Nobles swollen foot The Noble screams in pain
and anger But as camera pulls back Sinuhe with a
calm manner of indifference picks up his case and walks

away

Scene begins on top a huddle of roof tops all jammed
together no courtyards - homes of the very poor Camera
moves down into a narrow dirty street teeming with
humanity One can almost smell the stink in the heat and
feel the bite of flies Most of the people are of the
poor WORKING CLASS but there are FOREIGNERS too A
HITTITE with a high pointed cap and heavy pointed boots

a tribute-bearing mission en route from the docks to

some temple or palace These people are from the southern
land of Kush ebony black MOORS with incredibly thick lips
and ostrich feathers in their caps animal-eyed women
with children carried in baskets on their backs The men
lead animals on chains a couple of snarling panthers on

is approaching a group of men who are gambling throwing
dice squatted in the dirt A woman who is preparing to
fry fish on an open brazier before her hut cleaning the
fish scatters the entrails wherever - some hit one of

the gamblers who is angry but his companions laugh

OLD SINUHES VOICE
For the great majority it was a world
of dirt of poverty of disease and
death

Some of the fish guts hit against Sinuhes robe as he
passes the gambling group Moving camera pulls back

with him as he comes along carrying his portable medi-
cine case on his way to pay a professional visit He
has to stop as a dead body is carried out of one of the
huts the body wrapped carelessly in a shroud a stiff
leg showing Sinuhe observes this only as an everyday
occurrence A couple of steps later he has to stop again
as a line of PRISONERS are led across this street from
one side alley to another They are guarded by SOLDIERS
Their elbows are bound behind their backs They are
alike in their poverty and in a symbol which all wear
stitched onto their clothing It is the ankh or cross
of life something similar to the Christian cross except
that above the crossbar there is a loop-—f Sinuhe watches
them as they are led away to slavery or worse His face
hardens with anger

EXT SERIES OF REPRESENTATIONS OF THE ANCIENT GODS AND
GODDESSES OF EGYPT - DAY

These deities can be presented as statues against sky or
wall backing as low-relief and painted sculptures on
walls They should be selected from the most grotesque
primitive and fearful in their animal-headed representa-
tions - and might include Bes Set Ipet Sekhmet Anpu
Tet Thoth Hapi Bast Sebek Khonsu

OLD SINUHES VOICE
It was a world of superstition - of
fearful worship of a hundred ancient
gods

22 INT THRONE ROOM OF PHARAOHS PALACE - MOVING SHOT
PALACE ATTENDANTS - HOREMHEB AND BAKETAMON DAY

Camera angle is slightly down toward floor and camera

is advancing over a sea of backs of people who are pros
trate on their faces before the throne of Pharaoh We

do not see the throne at first nor Pharaoh These

people range from palace SLAVES to SOLDIERS MILITARY
OFFICERS COURTIERS OFFICIALS and ROYAL PRINCES AND
PRINCESSES All carry their proper insignia of office --
projecting above these backs are military weapons staffs
and the tall ostrich fans of the most high most near the
throne Arriving at the foot of the throne camera stops
Tethered there is a lion which lies on the floor Camera
pans slowly up picks up the golden sandals of Pharaoh
and his Queen then their legs then themselves HOREMHEB
fs standing stiffly before his throne chair impassively
surveying the multitude On his head is the double crown
of Egypt tall hat-like red and white - with the sacred
snake-head the Uraesus His hands carry the lash and

the crook the black and white crook in ceremonial posi-
tion just underneath his jeweled collar Many charms in
the shape of stiff emblems and variously knotted and
looped ribbons hang down from his hips On the wall be-
hind him there is a magnificent mural of a battle scene
which shows Horemheb bloodily slaying Hittites (The
decorations of this room are all very military the atmos
phere of this court is predominantly military) At 45
this warrior-King has not lost his military carriage

his physique is magnificent His face furrowed by battle
is also eroded by care and secret unhappiness -- his soul
is sick His queen BAKETAMON is already seated in her
chair of their double throne She also is bedecked with
full ceremonial clothing wig and jewelry A little more
than a year older than Horemheb she is still a most
beautiful woman with finely chiseled aristocratic fea
tures - showing the inbreeding decadence of a long line

of royalty She is completely impassive her dark eyes
have no sparkle but look ahead like the unseeing eyes of
a statue of a goddess - she is a woman who has totally
withdrawn from life Horemheb sits into his throne chair
Taking his time he looks to his left and down at someone
on the floor

Prostrate like the rest he nevertheless has an eye on
Horemhebd EIE is a very old man tall thin - with the
look of an ascetic gone sour - a crafty look A slight
signal from Horemheb gets him to his feet he gets up
painfully With his staff of office he raps on the
tiled floor

as all rise - but silently no buzz Their faces toward
the throne we see them arrayed all in their places
according to their ranks The highest nobles nearest
their ostrich fans now forming a canopy over Pharaoh and
the Queen Behind the right hand of the double throne
are two youths boys sons of this pair already warriors
in character

CLOSER TO THRONE FEATURING HOREMHEB AND EIE DAY

as a slight motion from Horemheb brings Eie to his side
Horemhebs look asks a question Elie bows Horemheb looks
toward a side door to the room On his face there comes
a strange expression - there is anger but lurking behind
it a kind of indecision as if he dreads what is coming
Then decision takes over and he gestures sharply Eie
turns toward the side door and his staff raps an order

Sinuhe is brought in His elbows are bound behind his
back Four SOLDIERS guard him led by an OFFICER who
carries a whip of office All watch as Sinuhe 1s brought
toward the throne Near throne the officer stops the
soldiers and all prostrate themselves leaving Sinuhe to
come before the throne alone On his clothing is sewed
the emblem of the cross of life He does not prostrate
himself before Horemheb but looks him in the face calmly

EIE

You stand
HOREMHEB

(sharply out of
corner of mouth)
Leave off

He is returning Sinuhes look for this is between the two
of them It is a flood of rising anger which Horemheb is
trying to control now

HOREMHEB
(after rather long pause
as if in wonder)
Were you and I once friends

For a moment there is a flicker between them as they each
remember - but the flicker is all the response there is
from Sinuhe -- the human connection between the two is
cut off as if by a switch

HOREMHEB
(as Pharaoh struggling
against rising rage)
You are Pharaohs friend no longer I
have been patient with you Sinuhe but
I can be patient no longerl

He is shaking with rage His hands grip the arms of his
throne chair until his knuckles are white He pulls him-
self to his feet

27 LONG SHOT - ALL DAY

As at this movement from Pharaoh all go on their knees
soundlessly automatically like mechanically operated
figures Only the Queen seated on her throne chair and
Horemheb and Sinuhe confronting each other on their feet
are on a higher level than the others

28 CLOSER ANGLE AT THRONE - THREE - DAY

Horemheb comes down a step of his throne until he is near
Sinuhe but still towering a step above him He points
accusingly at the emblem of the cross of life on Sinuhes
breast - then suddenly rips it off the garment tearing
part of the garment with it

HOREMHEB
(insensate with rage)
I could strangle you with my own hands

Sinuhes only answer is a slight broadening of his ironic
smile Baketamon turns her head slowly toward them For
the moment the goddess-stare leaves her eyes and she is

a woman looking at two men

BAKETAMON
(with an edge of scorn)

Whatever Pharaoh will do let him do it
quickly

Both men look at her Sinuhes look is a rather odd one
It is colored with the irony that he has shown Horemheb

But there is something else too which tells that these
two have known each other as people also He almost
imperceptibly inclines his head the barest indication of
a bow Baketamon looks away from his look looks straight
ahead again assumes the official look the blank stare

HOREMHEB
(blustering because
secretly abashed)
He is no more than a pebble between
my toes

He sits on his throne chair again Those in scene are
seen to rise indicative that all in court rise Horemheb
looks at Sinuhe again

HOREMHEB

I banish you from Egypt Never more
shall you see this land watered by
the Nilel

(with growing

rage again)
Live your days in lonelinesst May
your grave be unknown and your name
forgotten

Pharaoh has spoken

SINUHE
(after a pause still
with irony still
with a smile)
So be it
He turns and walks back in the way he entered

This is a peaceful spot A small area of clean sand dunes
(If city of Thebes in distance has not been seen in the
first shot of this sequence this shot is suggested as an
alternative) Atop a hillock there is a piece of archi-
tecture which is obviously a shrine - a small shaft (of
the kind we call Cleopatras needle) Kneeling at the
base of this shaft is AKHNATON Young (20s) frail
handsome to the point of prettiness ascetic He is

Idiot

He rushes to quiet the team of horses and right the
chariot Sinuhe equally angry comes to Akhnaton

SINUHE
Dont you know you could have been
killed

Akhnaton looks at him his eyes burning with such inten-
sity that they seem almost mad In a voice which has a
strange delicate almost feminine quality and given an
added strangeness by the choked intensity of his emotions
he says

AKHNATON
The god is coming
(looks eastward)

As Sinuhe reacts with astonishment Horemheb strides over

HOREMHEB
What did the fool say

SINUHE
(his astonishment being
replaced by amused disgust)
He said the god is coming

AKHNATON

staring toward the east)
The god is coming

Sinuhe and Horemheb also look eastward

forward onto his face and lies on the sand quivering

At least I can see that he doesnt

flask of water bound with reeds which he uncorks and
hands to Sinuhe Sinuhe dampens another strip of linen
with water and washes the young mans forehead

Look at him shiver

But at the same time he removes his cloak and spreads it
over Akhnaton

From just beyond the rise the sound of the trumpet is
heard again then over the rise there begins to appear a
detachment of SOLDIERS carrying lances - a small detach-
ment there will be ten of them in all Sinuhe and
Horemheb look at each other in even greater astonishment

SINUHE
What now

Horemheb sees that his team is threatening to bolt runs
to them

AT CHARIOT - SUNRISE

Horemheb seizes the bridles of his team of plunging horses
and at the same time looks around at

HILLOCK - A SMALL PROCESSION - SUNRISE

Following the detachment of soldiers comes a carrying-
chair transported on the shoulders of six SLAVES The
chair is accompanied by a couple of PRIESTS of a lower
rank than Eie and by a small group of COURTIERS of ob-
viously high rank who carry ostrich fans with which they
shield the occupant of the chair who is Baketamon at
this time not yet Queen but Princess

INT PHARAOHS PALACE - THRONE ROOM - PORTION OF A
CEREMONIAL PROCESSION - TEMPLE MAIDENS - DAY

Before we are made aware of the nature of the procession

or even of the locale of this scene we see these girls
The purpose of this opening scene is that of contrast

from the violence of the ending of the previous scene to
an atmosphere of gentle sweetness These girls are dressed
in flowing garments of virginal white unornamented except
for thin girdles of stones On bare feet they move with
steps which are practically movements of a dance On
their fingers they wear little cymbals which they make
reverberate with sweet music

EXTREMELY LONG SHOT - ENTIRE COURT ROOM - DAY

We have seen this room before but not as it appears now
for while in the other instance the decorations were all
warlike and violent they are now gentle with flowers
and water fowl the prevailing motifs

The procession is at the far end of the room too far

for us to see to identify its participants but we guess
correctly that it is the entrance of Pharaoh his family
and principal courtiers to the throne There is a throng
in the court room all of whom are bowed to the floor

CLOSER ANGLE - PROCESSION - DAY

Following the maidens come some priests including Ele
and courtiers who carry fans to make a canopy over
Pharaoh We see that Pharaoh is none other than Akhnaton
Beside him walks his queen NEFERTITI a young woman as
beautiful and frail as he They walk with their arms
around each others waist Directly behind them walks

the Princess Baketamon At her side is Baketamons mother
THE QUEEN MOTHER TAIA a swarthy-complexioned evil and
interesting old woman In turn come princes and prin-
cesses of the royal household

Akhnaton carries the emblems of his office carelessly in
his free hand and with them with quiet reproof he is
gesturing those in the court room to get to their feet

AKHNATON
Will you never learn that we are all
friends here

WEAR SIDE OF ROOM IN MIDST OF CROWD - SINUHE AND HOREMHEB
WITH MILITARY GUARD - DAY

At the sound of Akhnatons voice Sinuhe raises his head
sharply but those who are getting to their feet all around
him block his view of the speaker

(roughly)
On your facesi

There are four soldiers guarding Sinuhe and Horemheb

with an under-officer whose rank would compare with that
of a sergeant It takes a prod of the sergeants lance
between his shoulder blades to get Horemheb to the floor
Sinuhe is already there but is alive with excitement and
apprehension at what he fears he has discovered

AT THRONE - DAY

Akhnaton and Nefertiti take their places on the double
throne - she putting her arm about him and laying her
face against his shoulder As the royal family includ-
ing Baketamon and Talia take their places to one side

and slightly behind the throne as courtiers priests and
officials take their places according to their rank -

also The entrance of Sinuhe into scene is hardly no-

Sinuhe throws himself on his face before the throne and
intones the customary salutation

SINUHE

Lower Egypt Living Forever and
Ever woe

Akhnaton turns his attention to him lifts a hand which
stops instantly the childish game and brings silence in
the court

SINUHE

Sinuhe raises his head and looks at him

BAKETAMON - DAY

The old lady gives a start She leans forward her eyes
glistening with a strange excitement With an unconscious
gesture she grips Baketamons wrist whose usual aloofness
is enough disturbed that she looks at her mother with
curiosity

SINUHES VOICE

Then Baketamon looks off in the direction from which she
hears a buzz of excitement

Horemheb is walking sturdily toward the throne His bear-

As Horemheb arrives before the throne he is still look-

to Akhnaton He does not make the usual reverence but
only looks steadily at the monarch There is a buzz of
excitement at this audacity

88 SINUHE AND HOREMHEB - DAY

Sinuhe grows afraid for him - tries to signal him to make
the reverence but Horemheb doesnt see

HOREMHEB

high in an arc eyes on Pharaoh Only at the moment that

from the onlookers

He tosses down to Sinuhe an honor in the form of a
jeweled chain (necklace) which Sinuhe in his intense
excitement almost fails to catch Akhnation is now
smiling openly even with affection at Sinuhe He speaks
again and with each phrase tosses down another jeweled
golden honor in the form of a necklace a bracelet a

EXT THE STREET TO THE DOCKS - MOVING SHOT - SINUHE

There are a number of drinking places along this part of
the street and the atmosphere is rather gay Light shines
from a tall column of a street lamp -an open flame Music
comes from some interior - probably ‘Syrian music Some
soldiers with girls - a mixed crowd someone passing in
a carrying chair with runners going ahead shouting Make
wayl” wee

Sinuhe and Horemhed are slanting across the street toward
an inn above the entrance gate of which is displayed a
huge dried crocodile which gives the place its name The
Crocodilets Tail Wearing all the honors which Akhnaton
has this day bestowed on them they have set out to make a
night of it - but only Sinuhe is in the mood Horemheb
being rather glum

HOREMHEB
She commanded our arrest She gave
the signal which saved my life When
I tried to thank her she all but spat
at me Who can understand a woman

SINUHE

not love them

bitterness)
Easy enough for you to talk your aim
is on a tavern girl

SINUHE
How little you know her Half my
trouble comes from being half in love
When a man gives his heart he gives
his power - a woman is taken in com
pletely only by a man who does not
believe a word he tells her

ing to better humor)

silver bangles on her wrists By character she is self-

at him nor at Horemheb but approaches the table as to
strangers her eyes on the tray her mind apparently only
on what she is doing In this manner she begins to serve
the wine Sinuhe stares at her Deciding that this must
be some game she has invented out of caprice he opens his
cloak with a gesture which he thinks she cannot miss dis-
playing Pharaohs honors Horemheb alerted sensing some-
thing does the same Not a reaction from Merit her eyes
on table and what she is doing In consternation sure
now that this is a deliberate caprice Sinuhe is put to
the necessity of offering -

SINUHE
Happy is the loveliness of the night

No response In consternation Sinuhe throws a glance at
Horemheb Merit finished with her business with the wine
in a tone which plainly says that it is only the customary
phrase of every serving girl to any customer -

finally to reach out and grab her skirt to stop her

INT NEFERS HOUSE - CENTRAL HALL - LOW ANGLE CLOSE SHOT -
A CAT - NEFERS LEGS - SOME DANCING GIRLS IN BG - NIGHT

General description of setting We are in a smart city
house in which a party is in progress (see illustration
WATL GEOGRAPHIC Oct 1942 p 505) There is food a
buffet table heaped with it with fruits and flowers
There are flowers everywhere -- tubs of growing plants
and baskets arranged cleverly with flowers fruits and
vegetables All of the guests wear flowers garlands
around their necks and single blossoms in their head-
dresses - many of the guests carry single blossoms in
their hands Slaves carry around wine vases draped with
flowers and even the tall pink colums which support
the ceiling of this two-storied hall terminate with carv-
ings representing opening lotus blooms All of this is
general description which is to be fully disclosed only
as we go along for scene opens on a close shot of Nefers
CAT

The cat wears a colored collar which is studded with gems
and it is tethered to the leg of an armchair which chair
is on a slightly raised dais and is decorated with symbols
of the cat-headed goddess Bast There is a woman seated
in the chair but of her we see only a pair of beautiful
legs beneath a sheer linen garment with jeweled anklets
above jeweled sandals The cat is rubbing against the
legs In direct bg we have a more or less clear
suggestion of some DANCING GIRLS who move with sensuous
feline grace to os music of harp lyre guitar tam-
bourine pipes and flutes

As the cat looks os ita attention apparently arrested
by something -

MED LONG SHOT TOWARD DOUBLE ENTRANCE DOOR TO HALL -
SINUHE AND HOREMHEB NIGHT

Again the scene contains the suggestion of the dancing
girls along one side of screen and we may also see at
least a portion of the ORCHESTRA the members of which
like the dancing girls are slave girls - but the focus
of attention is the deor through which Sinuhe and
Horemheb enter They come in like strangers arriving in
unfamiliar surroundings By entrance slave SERVANTS
both men and women enter to them stoop remove their
sandals and begin to wash their feet in rich bowls

CLOSE ANGLE - SINUHE AND HOREMHEB - NIGHT

look around and then look at each other as if to say
This is not so bad Of the two Horemheb is the more
at ease for Sinuhe still is uncomfortable as a result
of his quarrel with Merit

THE CAT - NEFER - NIGHT

Almost immediately a pair of arms decked with jewelry
reach down into scene take up the cat and we see

WEFER She is very beautiful with an experienced look
about her Her hair is dyed blue and is sprinkled with
gold and silver powder She wears much red jewelry

Her eyebrows are blackened and beneath her eyes is painted
a green shadow But greener than all green are her eyes
themselves Holding the cat on her lap stroking it she
looks off at -

SAME MED LONG SHOT TOWARD DOOR AS BEFORE - SINUHE AND
HOREMHEB - TWO LADIES - NIGHT

The slaves have completed washing the guests feet and
as they replace their sandals and rise a LADY enters
scene She is very attractive wears a garland around
her neck and carries another This she puts around the
neck of Horemheb who is nearest her and -

LADY

Come

She offers her left hand Horemheb grins back at Sinuhe
takes the ladys hand and allows himself to be led os
Sinuhe smiles after him until he feels a garland of
flowers slipped around his own neck turns and sees that
a 2ND LADY is smiling at him and offering her hand

2ND LADY
Come

Suddenly Sinuhe finds himself embarrassed and realizes
that the impulse which has brought him here with Horemheb
will not mecessarily carry him farther

SINUHE

head)
You will pardon

He manages to convey with some gestures that he has some
business with someone over there moves away edging

of jewelry which she tosses off to -

The leader of the girls catches the bauble Instantly
the dancing and the music stop The leader bows and the
dancers run away Nefer turns to look back at Sinuhe

MOVING SHOT GOING WITH SINUHE - NIGHT

He moves among the merrymakers trying to look as incon-
spicuous as possible ‘Two slaves enter scene from the
opposite direction carrying an image of the god Osiris
a small mummy-image on a decorated bier accompanied by
a BUTLER who is saying to one and all and to Sinuhe
the customary -

BUTLER
Eat drink and be joyful - for no
one knows what tomorrow will bring

The image is followed by girl slaves who bear cakes and
others who bear wine

A GIRL SLAVE
(to Sinuhe)
Honey cakes my lord

Painfully aware of being an uninvited guest Sinuhe never-
theless takes a honey cake

SLAVE GIRL
Wine my lord

Thus pressed Sinuhe takes a glass of wine and with
the goblet in his hand chances to look up and see -

FROM SINUHES PERSPECTIVE - NEFER - NIGHT

is looking directly at him

SINUHE - NIGHT

is struck by two things simultaneously a feeling that

this is the most beautiful woman he has ever beheld and
a sharp guilt that he is uninvited here He turns away
drinks the wine at a gulp puts the goblet on the tray

of the slave who is just going away and with this same
movement slips out of sight behind some guests

smiling at all her business of drawing the cat toward

her conveys an invitation

SINUHE

SINUHE

NEFER
Oh

She reaches out and takes one of his hands to prevent his
taking off the flowers At the same time -

science of healing We know the skill
of curing blindness with a needle - the
use of splints for broken bones - of
salves to prevent wounds from festering -
of drugs to induce false sleep so that
men do not feel pain

in vapor there might be indications of the mechanics by
which bodies are carried up to vats on ramps divested
of their shrouds and thrown into the liquid chemicals
But predominantly the effect should be only mystic and
weird a kind of inferno - hell on earth Possibly a
green light cast over scene would be effective Just

PRINCE SHUBB
Do you see something in that map more
interesting than in my eye

SINUHE
At least stranger to me Prince for
I am not a military man If my name
were Horemheb I think I should con-
clude that you Hittites are planning
an invasion against the land of Egypt

There is an appreciable start from the commanders at

this
smiling

The Prince looks around at them unruffled and

PRINCE SHUBB-
It matters not what this man sees
In our land he is an honored guest
whom we like so much we are going to
keep here for life

(to Sinuhe )
Shall we agree on your fee
(laughs )
Do not demand more than half the
Kingdom
SINUHE

I shall astonish you My fee shall
be exactly of the size of the foreign
particle which has lodged in your
princely eye

The Prince laughs and Simuhe laughs with him He bends
forward to business He has one of the Commanders hold
open the Princes eye From a portable medicine kit he
takes a small copper instrument like a tweezer another
like a minute Imife Kaptah begins to walk around the

tent

This makes the commanders nervous especially

when Kaptah gets near the passageway leading to the tent
of the armorers

INT BIG ARMORERS TENT - GENERAL SHOT - DAY

In this place weapons of all sorts are made spears
scythes for chariots knives It is the close of the
day and many of the armorers are leaving their tasks and
going out of the tent but some still hammer at their
forges

CLOSE ANGLE MOVING SHOT - SINUHE AND KAPTAH A HITTITE
ARMORER - DAY

Sinuhe and Kaptah come along looking about at what they
can see Sinuhe seems to be increasingly possessed of
an almost unbearably great inner excitement Presently
they come upon the forge of AN ARMORER Obviously he
knows Sinuhe for he smiles and nods a greeting to him

SINUHE

My friend -

(from out of clothing

takes particle nemoved

from Princes eye)
- from the eye of your Prince I have
removed a small sliver of a metal
with which you Hittites make your
weapons What is it called

history of the world What is it

2h9 ANGLE TO INCLUDE SEVERAL OF THE COMMANDERS - DAY

who were in the Princes tent and who are now coming by
Beyond them we see that the last of the armorers are
quitting work and that in a moment or two this particular
armorer will be the last The commanders are in very
good spirits

A COMMANDER
(to armorer)
Tell this guest anything he wants
to know

He and his companions laugh at the joke as they pass
along to go out of the tent

250 ANOTHER ANGLE - SINUHE KAPTAH ARMORER - DAY

The armorer goes to a rack on which are kept many weapons
of various sorts including some copper and some of the
new metal He picks up a spear with a copper head He
drives it against his stone anvil The spearhead bends
double

ARMORER
(with contempt)
Egyptian copper

He picks up another drives it against the anvil It
too bends double

ARMORER
(with contempt)

He picks up a third of the new metal He drives it
against the stone anvil The weapon chips a plece from
the stone

he wears until the armorer is in a sweat Kaptah is
looking on in horror

KAPTAH
(cries out)
Master have you taken leave of your
senses

Sinuhe begins on Kaptah taking off from him every piece
of value

KAPTAH
(almost in tears)
Take my life but not these

When all is on the ground in front of the armorer Sinuhe
looks at him The armorer walks to the rack takes a
spearhead without handle brings it surreptitiously and
hands it to Simuhe With a look of joy Sinuhe takes it
and hides it in his clothing As armorer goes to pick
up the wealth camera moves to close shot of Simuhe and
Kaptah who during this latter part of the scene has
been rendered speechless in his anguish

KAPTAH
You have given all your wealth for one
spearhead of iron

joy)
With this passport I will dare return

It 1s almost like night in here though it is day A
little early morning light comes through a very high
very small window Sinuhe is in chains Unable to walk
on account of the chains he sits on the dirty floor
his back propped against a stone wall - a victim of
apprehension and despair There is some unspeakably
unappetizing food in a bowl on the floor nearby which he
has not touched He is unshaven his clothing and hair
are matted with the dirty straw on which he has slept --
all indications are that he has been in prison for at
least forty-eight hours Presently he hears as and source
of even greater apprehension the sound of marching feet
obviously military approaching

SINUHE AND TAIA - TWO NUBIANS - DAY

Scene begins on a close shot of Sinuhe in the same attitude
as the previous scene that is prostrate on the floor

He has been bathed and dressed in fine linen The floor
made of tiles is decorated with gold and semiprecious
stones

QUEEN TAIAS VOICE
Arise Sinuhe - I have much to say to
you

Camera pulls back This room gives out onto the court-
yard of the House of Women in which a pleasant fountain
plays in the bright sunlight In the Queen Mothers

room are a great number of birds which twitter in cages
The old Queen is sitting cross-legged on a rich mat She
is a curious mixture of royalty and peasantry On her
peasants hands she wears rich rings She is drinking
ale Present in the room are the two NUBIANS who are
waiting on her It is obvious also from the fact that
they both have drinking cups near at hand that they have
been drinking with her They are interesting if somewhat
sinister fellows of a race which has pointed heads as a
result of having them shaped when infants and who wear
ivory pins through their noses The Queen has set aside
some work she has been doing a mat of reeds she has been
weaving Sinuhe gets to his feet He is astonished at
what is happening to him and bewildered

SINUHE

as Sinuhe wonders what he has gotten into -

TAIA

277 CLOSER ANGLE - SINUHE AND TAIA - DAY

Sinuhe sits down near her thinking that now at last some
key to the mystery will be given him But for a space
Taia only weaves on her mat and then -

TATA
Dont you admire the way a Queen can
weave a mat of reeds

Sinuhe looks with surprise at the mat watching the flying
fingers of the Queen Then something about the mat strikes
him very forcibly The Queen looks at him and he at her

SINUHE

Are those fowlers knots

TA

(lightly)
Was I not born a bird-catchers daughter

with knots like these

wives - and I The others despised me
for my dusky skin and broad feet but
I kmew the way to charm Pharaoh ---

young body and knew how to use it

SINUHE

TAIA
It was my resolve that no other wife
should bear a son and bring him alive
to Pharaoh until I had done so

For some reason Sinuhes look is drawn to her fingers
again

TATA
But when I deemed it time for breeding
I bore to my horror a girl - the
proud Baketamon I have not married
her off -- she still remains an arrow
in my quiver Then I bore this son -
this puny Akhnaton - but my son whom
I placed on the throne -- born in the
same year as you - born six months
after you ---

INT THRONE ROOM OF PHARAOHS PALACE - TIGHT SHOT AT
THRONE - AKHNATON QUEEN EIE PRINCE SHUBBILULIUMA
COURTIERS AND SOLDIERS - THEN HOREMHEB - DAY

Our concentration is on a table before the throne on
which slaves of the Hittite Prince are heaping presents
for Pharaoh

Let us pause to set down some general details which will
be picked up as the scene progresses Some changes have
taken place in Akhnatons court since the last time we
saw it Though the Queen sits on the double throne with
him she doesnt sit with her arm draped about him as
before but aloof and estranged The children are no
longer present The happy atmosphere is gone In
Akhnaton a marked change is to be noted He looks posi-
tively 111 There are black shadows under his eyes put
there by suffering It is as if the spirit inside him
is consuming the body of the man Decorations of the
throne room have been changed -- behind Pharaohs throne
on a wall is to be seen a very large representation of
the Cross of Life It is the single decoration in the
room

Now let us return to scene - the table being heaped with
rich presents for Pharaoh And Prince Shubbiluliuma in
the capacity of Hittite Ambassador is saying -

PRINCE SHUBB
(with oily unctuousness)
Accept these few poor gifts Divine
Pharaoh as evidence of the great love
that we Hittites bear for Egypt Our
King like you loves only peace --

with reverberation All eyes go to the spearhead
Prince Shubbiluliuma blanches Horemheb steps into
scene

HOREMHEB
This Hittite lies
(points to spearhead)
There is the evidence of treachery
With a metal called iron the Hittites
make weapons with which they plan the
conquest of Egypt

285 WIDER ANGLE DAY

There is general consternation We see that Sinuhe has
been brought to the throne room by Horemheb but has been
left in the crowd out of view of the throne

286 ANOTHER TIGHT ANGLE AT THRONE - DAY

The Hittite Prince after his start of surprise con-
trives a smile

AKHNATON

Horemheb Horemheb when will you
learn Suspicion breeds only sus-
picion and hatred hatred

(patiently firmly

turning to Ete)

breeds only blood until we would drown
in it

EIE
(after hesitant pause)
At the Royal Granaries your troops
were stoned by your people I must
counsel Pharaoh to make concessions
to the Priests of the old gods before
this kingdom is lost

For a moment Pharaoh stares at Eie in surprise Then -
AKHNATON
(stubbornly)
I forgive the people for they know
not what they do

Horemheb can stand no more turns on his heel and appar-
r ently walks away

or not it contains a threat to Sinuhe

AKHNATON

Come close to me Sinuhe

Sinuhe looks up in wonder sees warmth shining in
Akhnatons weary sick face

SINUHE
You are not angry

- AKHNATON
Is the shepherd angry at the stray
lamb which returns to the fold
(anxiously)
Have you returned to me Sinuhe

Looking at him in wonder Sinuhe gets to his feet On
the way to the throne he plucks the Hittite spearhead
out of the table and takes it with him and supposing
thet Akhnaton has caused them to be alone so that he can
hear the truth as Sinuhe knows it -

sit here -- he is my father in heaven
and he has spoken to me his son He
is a god of love He commands all men
to live as brothers and to love most
of all our enemies To him all men
are precious There is no difference
between rich and poor noble or slave
colored or white I have proclaimed
Gods kingdom on earth but some of my
people will not believe me Some call
me evil Some call me mad My own
mother calls me mad

Sinuhe has a chilling memory of his interview with the
Queen Mother

AKHNATON

Is a man mad is he evil when his
only madness his only evil is in
loving the world

SINUHE
(very disturbed)
It would be very wonderful if the
world could be as Pharaoh imagines
it - but it is not

AKHNATON
It was meant to be Will you be my
friend and help me Sinuhe I am so
very weak

SINUHE
Pharaoh is weak

AKENATON
The weakest of all men -- with the
biggest task - the biggest burden --
Will you help me

SINUHE

I ama physician I can heal bodies
I have even cured the blind But I
know nothing of bringing light to mens
souls When Pharaoh speaks something
moves me which I do not understand --
but I do not know your god

alms He does not at once recognize the beggar as Kaptah

EXT INNER COURTYARD OF THE TEMPLE OF ATON - LONG SHOT -
DAY

This temple unlike the temples of the old gods of Egypt
is not roofed but open to the clear air and the sun

Ir general pattern it is an open courtyard surrounded

by a high wall with a pyloned gate There are no dark
and mysterious places in this temple There are no idols
no representations of the fearful gods Akhnatons god
is represented by two pure symbols One of these is a
rather large Cross of Life the other is a column of the
type we saw when he worshipped on the plains outside
Thebes - the type of shaft we call Cleopatras Needle”
On the walls there are pictorial decorations Some of
these show the fuller representations of the symbol of
Akhnatonts god In these god is represented as the disc
of the sun from the lower perimeter of which hands reach
down in an attitude of benediction some of these hands
holding the Cross of Life Sometimes scenes of Pharaoh
and his Queen and Pharaoh and his whole family are shown
with this symbol There are altars at the bases of the
shaft and of the cross

There is a religious ceremony in progress and worship-
ers most of whom are of the middle and lower classes
and all of whom wear the Cross of Life are bringing
offerings to the altars such offerings being chiefly
fruits and flowers The ceremony is being supervised
by priests who are mostly rather young men and are not
the fat and oily fellows of the priesthood of the old
gods The worshipers are singing a hymn - one composed
by Akhnaton himself Although this music continues over
several succeeding shots the complete lyrics are given
here for convenience

Thy dawning is beautiful in the
horizon of heaven
Oh living Aton beginning of life
When Thou risest in the eastern
horizon of heaven
Thou fillest every land with Thy
beauty
The two lands of Egypt are in daily
festivity
Awake and standing on their feet
For Thou hast raised them up)
The birds flutter in their marshes
Their wings uplifted in adoration
tc Thee
All the sheep dance upon their feet
All the winged things fly
They live when Thou hast shone upon
them
The fish in the river leap up before
Thee

Sinuhe cannot miss the fact that the atmosphere about
this pair is that of conspiracy He would like to avoid
them

SINUHE

jesting tone)
This is my day of popularity in the

As a friend we bear Akhnaton only the

a medicine that would cure his head-

come and the temple gates will be
shut behind him Alone with me he
thinks to have his way with me by

The Queen Mother spoke through her
ale

Holding his hands she pulls him down on the couch to sit
beside her She continues to hold his hands and with
an air of soft intimacy which is surprising in her -

BAKETAMON
You are my half-brother - and the
rightful heir to the throne

A conviction that she is speaking the truth begins to grow
in Sinuhe It is by no means an altogether welcome thought
it ils a frightening thought - but one which fascinates
him

BAKETAMON
While my mother awaited the birth of
Akhnaton there was another child born
in the palace For once the black
arts of my mothers Nubians had failed
When the mother cried out to see her
son that she might present him to
Pharaoh they showed her a dead girl
baby With her own hands my mother
wove the basket in which you were cast

395 (Cont)

He reaches out and takes one of the goblets Horemheb
nervous makes sure that Akhnaton is looking at the goblet
shifts his eyes quickly to Sinuhe in question Sinuhe nods
Satisfied Horemheb sets the tray with the other two gob-
lets on a small table by the couch Akhnaton looks at them
and with a gesture invites them to be seated

HOREMHEB
(cheerfully)
Like old times Do you remember when we
three met on the dessert - young men «--

AKHNATON
(disregarding him to Sinuhe)
If you bring me peace it will be sweeter
than the scent of myrrh

With a sudden surprisingly swift motion he drains the
goblet A half-gesture from Sinuhe is too late As
Horemheb watches with great suspense Akhnaton sighs lets
the goblet roll from his hand and lays his head back onto
the headrest

HOREMHEB
(with satisfaction)
Much brighter tomorrow

396 VERY TIGHT SHOT - THREE - NIGHT

AKHNATON

(fervently)
Sinuhe Harken to me God has not for-
saken me When you left me on the roof top
- as darkness descended - I saw the true
light All things I have spoken I had from
God I die not because I tried to deceive
the world but because I tried to make it
noble - With what difficulty does God try
to reveal Himself - for we His children
are blind and stupid For ages through
the great circle of time He has tried -
He tried with me -- I was frail and weak
but He has shown me His love permitting
me to die in His cause I tell you I
was the shadow of One Who will come -- the
Mighty One -- a King of Kings

(weakening)
I was a shadow to walk before Him

He stops talking and Horemheb and Sinuhe looking at him
understand that he is dead For a long moment they are
silent then -

SINUHE

(more to himself than

Horemheb)
Why have I done this Was it for the
good of Egypt Was it because he asked
me and I loved him -- did I hate him
because of Merit and Thoth Or is it
written that a man must live his life
until his cup be full to overflowing

397 WIDER ANGLE - SINUHE AND HOREMHEB - NIGHT

Horemheb rises and looks down at Akhnaton He takes off
his cloak and as he did in the desert spreads it over
the still frail form He straightens rises to his full
height seems to expand

HOREMHEB
This is the hour I have awaited all my
life
(with a kind of awe)
I am Egypt now

He picks up his goblet raises it

SINUHE
(fascinated quietly)
Horemheb

HOREMHEB
And I will do such deeds for her glory -

SINUHE
Dont drink it

Horemheb looks an astonished question at him

SINUHE
Or you will not be Egypt - or any - thing

Slowly comprehension dawns on Horemheb The hand which
holds the goblet begins to tremble he drops the goblet
which rings on the floor and wine splashes everywhere

SINUHE
Go to the temple Horemheb --

HOREMHEB
(fright growing into anger)
You dared -

SINUHE

SINUHE (Cont)

(walking away into room)
She will be greatly surprised for it is
not you she expects and no doubt the
claws of the lioness goddess will rip
into you - but you can prevail

(on the other side of cot

looks at crown etc on

table)
Go to the temple climb the throne -

(throws crown more at

him than to him)
- receive your crown and bless my name
for I an insignificant physician have
make you Pharaoh

HOREMHEB
You really dared

SINUHE
Yes I dared and dare now had not
Akhnatons last words saved us both
Wear the dirty crown --

HOREMHEB
This was treason I will -

SINUHE

(with scorn)
You will will what you will You will
go to war and win a battle You will con-
quer and not know that it is defeat You
will raise Egypt to glory and watch her
die Horemheb the crown is heavy and
you will wear it with sorrow We live in
the twilight of Egypt and you will be her
sunset Nations rise only to fall - races
die out kings build mighty monuments
only to have them crumble into dust - glory
flees like a shadow - all these things are
earthly and have the seed of death in them
Only a thought can live only a great truth
can grow and flourish and a truth cannot be
killed It passes in secret from one mans
heart to another - it is given in a mothers
milk to her child -- How many upheavals must
occur how many people be swept from the
face of the earth before the truth shines
in glory but it will it will

(with amused scorn)
Are you trying to tell me that you will
fight against me Sinuhe

SINUHE - NIGHT

SINUHE
Oh you will win that too - you will
silence me But not for a long time
for we are bound together you and I
the knowledge of a mutual crime
forms bonds even stronger than those
of friendship - and until you do
silence me ---

(with amused scorn)
Yes - and what will you do physician

ANGLE TO SINUHE - NIGHT

with camera moving very slowly to him during -

SINUHE

(simply but with increasing

calm fervor)
I will go amongst the people and speak of
the God who loves us all I will wear the
clothes of slaves and kick the sandals off
my feet and speak to the wives as they fry
their fish before their mud huts by the
river - to the porters on the docks to
the smiths at their bellows to the mer-
chants who mix sand with flour - to the
mill owners who gag their slaves that they
might not eat the corn they grind - to the
judges who give wrong judgments for bribes
- to the nobles who will set their dogs on
me and I will say

color of his skin or by his speech or
by his clothes and jewels but only by
his heart A good man is better than a
bad man and justice is better than in-

A swift wide motion of his hand sets the scroll rolling

They pause out of breath

HOREMHEB
(gay and carefree)
Well here we are - our lessons learned

MERIT
I am proud So proud

They link arms come along the street camera retreating
ahead of them Suddenly Sinuhe slows down Merit adjusts
her pace to his Then he stops altogether She looks at
him - sees that there is a faraway look in his eyes a
thoughtful look on his face

MERIT
What are you thinking about

With a slight start Sinuhe comes out of his absorption
He glances at the diploma in his hand then looks at Merit

SINUHE
(eager alive)
I wonder what this life holds in store
for m seco
Then lightheartedly they start to walk again coming
directly toward camera their faces alive with hope- and
expectation for the future
