The morning anchor gushes for a heartbeat

MORNING ACNHOR

do this You’re going to let us

HENRY
The real secret is to get back to

Use an old fork to cut your mix
Use the heel of your hand to
flatten the crust We were actually
built to make pies

MORNING ACNHOR
Where on Earth did you learn to
make such a perfect pie crust

The same hand goes through a boy’s closet The clothes are
worn and a little dated and a little youthful for twelve We
finally pull back to see Henry He wears his sensitivity and
the anxiety of pre-sexual enlightenment like wet pajamas As
he looks into his closet his face reads dilemma
MOMENTS LATER he is trying on a pair of pants for Adele He
clearly outgrew them a year ago The cuffs are inches above
his ankles The buckle won’t buckle
ADELE enters frame and acknowledges the moment with a sigh

ADULT HENRY (VO)
For the most part my mother never
mentioned my father or the woman
he was married to now

ADELE
(studying the photo)
I would think your father would be
worried about the way that baby’s one
eye doesn’t match with the other
Youd think they’d have her tested
Does she seem different to you

HENRY
- Maybe a little

ADELE
That baby doesn’t look anything
like you

Even if that meant only leaving the

Henry reaches for one when he is bumped by a middle aged
woman Henry flinches and moves on to the COMICS RACK

He spins the turnstile of superheroes We’re following his
gaze down past caped crusaders when we find a pair of MEN’S
SHOES They’re worn in and muddy Upon closer glance one is
stained with FRESH BLOOD trailing from the man’s ankle

Henry looks up following the legs and torso until he is
staring up at FRANK He is the illustration in a biology
book for a page they’d label Man

FRANK
Wonder if you could give me a hand
here

Frank is wearing a RED PRICEMART VEST Henry notices blood
over Frank’s right ear Trickling down from his hair line

HENRY
(careful)
Youre bleeding

FRANK
(like nothing)
I fell out a window

HENRY
We should get help

FRANK
I wouldn’t want to upset anyone
You came here with that woman over

there right
Frank nods at Adele who is just leaving Boys’ Clothes Dept

HENRY
My mom

FRANK
What I wanted to ask is if you
think she’d give me a ride

We see Henry’s gears turning Frank takes an awkward step
forward and places a firm grip on Henry’s shoulder

FRANK (CONTD)
She looks like the type of person
who would help me

ADULT HENRY (VO)
He was right That’s exactly the
type my mom was

CUT TO

Frank and Henry are walking with purpose in Adele’s
direction Frank is trying not to limp He grabs a BALLCAP

grabs a FLEECE and quickly throws it on

her son’s face - Frank’s muscular hand on his shoulder

FRANK
You have a good boy here Adele He
was kind enough to offer me a ride
ADELE
Oh well um He may have We
have a big afternoon I don’t think
we can help you

Frank reaches into his pocket and pulls out a baseball

FRANK
(to Henry)
Shame Thought we could have a
catch
HENRY

I suck at baseball

FRANK
Maybe you used to
(fingering the stitches)
Throw around the ball with your
dad

HENRY
I only see him on Sundays

ADELE
(cuts Henry off)
I’m sorry but we really can’t help
you

For a moment Frank clenches his teeth in pain Then he
MOVES HIS HAND to the back of Henry’s neck It’s hard to
interpret whether it’s a gesture of kindness or a threat

FRANK
(to Adele)
(Frankly) this needs to happen

Adele looks deeply into Franks eyes She makes a decision

INT CHECKOUT PRICEMART - DAY 22

Adele’s items are rung up A bomb shelter’s worth of canned
goods go by beep beep beep beep Frank shows curiosity
at the sheer amount He then adds the baseball and mitt to
the checkstand

where she could say something She considers asking for help

She doesn’t

Frank opens the rear passenger door of Adele’s car and lays
the fleece across the back seat

Thank you

(to Henry)
Why don’t you ride in back with me

HENRY
(cautious)
Okay

Henry enters the rear passenger door and slides over Frank
sits down next to him and shuts the door

Adele rounds the car trying not to panic She enters the
driver’s side door and takes a seat Shuts the door Silence

ADELE
Where do you want to go

FRANK

Adele suppresses a reaction

FRANK (CONTD)
Just for a moment to rest my legs

She looks back and sees her son sitting next to this
commanding and bloodied stranger She turns the ignition

24 INT ADELE’S STATION WAGON - DAY 24
Driving back through the suburbs Strangely calm and quiet
Just as they pull up to a stoplight A POLICE CRUISER pulls
up on their left Henry notices His heart quickens Frank
keeps his eyes straight trying to act calm Adele looks over
at the cops She thinks for a second then puts on her signal

and turns right pulling away from the cruiser

They catch a glimpse of each other in the mirror A moment

FRANK
Sounds like the rotors on your
brakes might be a little thin I’1l
take a look when we get back

EXT ADELE’S STREET - DAY 25

Adele’s station wagon makes its way down the quiet cul-de-sac
and finally parks in the driveway Frank takes a second to
look around for pedestrians before getting out to help Adele
and Henry with the groceries

As they’re emptying the car Henry can’t help but look back
at his neglected home seeing it through the eyes of a
stranger for the first time in what’s obviously a while

ADULT HENRY (VO)
Other than religious types or
someone with a petition hardly
anyone ever came to see us By this
point my mom was down to basically
one friend and even Evelyn hardly
came by anymore

but Frank already has an elbow on it Smiles - Get inside

INT ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 26

Adele leads the grocery caravan into the kitchen All the
while Henry looks around seeing what Frank is seeing

Adele positions herself near the KNIFE DRAWER

ADELE
(eyeing Frank cautiously)
How do you take your coffee

FRANK
As is Thank you Adele

Frank notices all the window sheers have been drawn Thinks
on this for a second He moves to the kitchen window and
looks out back - The backyard is an unkept mess of overgrown
grass leading to a thick woods We hear the distant SOUND OF
A TRAIN’S WHISTLE

He takes in the kitchen table - a foreign object There’s a
silence One that acknowledges that neither Adele or Frank
know how they’ve made it this far

HENRY
How did you hurt your leg

Frank weighs the question

FRANK

I’m going to be straight with you
here Henry

(looks to Adele making

coffee)
I’m not going to lie

(back to Henry)
I hurt my leg - my leg and my head
- jumping out a second floor window
at a hospital they’d taken me to
get my appendix out

INT RECOVERY ROOM HOSPITAL - DAY 29

for the damn leg

lawn twisting his ankle painfully SNAP goes a ligament

INT ADELE’S KITCHEN - DAY 32

Adele hands Frank his coffee She seems to be taking in every
moment Every inch of Frank’s face Every gesture

FRANK
Id be grateful if you let me stay
til nightfall I’d try to help out
Wouldn’t ask anything of you

ADELE
(cautious)
You just did

FRANK
Nothing more than a place to lay
low and rest my leg for a few
hours

ADELE
How do I know you won’t hurt us

FRANK
I’ve never intentionally hurt
anyone in my life

Adele considers this We want to believe him Henry observes
his mother carefully

You understand how that could be
hard to believe

I do How far are the train tracks
from your backyard

ADELE
People come over Often Randomly
Friends salesmen religious
people

Frank hides his disbelief

FRANK
I’1l make a run for the train at

way

ADELE
I mean it would be noticed if I
went quiet Even for a little bit

FRANK
I just escaped prison Last place I
want to go is back

It didn’t happen that way

HENRY
Isn’t it against the law to hide a
fugitive

FRANK

You have a wise son here Adele Good
to know he’s looking out for you

ADELE

(trying to calm her son as

well as Frank)
It’s all going to be fine It would
only be a problem if someone found
Frank here And that doesn’t need
to happen He can just lay low for
a few hours and then keep moving

FRANK

True enough But it’s still not
acceptable to place you and your
family here in jeopardy If someone
were to come by it would need to
look like I kidnapped you

That’s why I’m going to tie you up

Frank’s torso Frank’s neck and then Frank’s face
hidden in the shadows It takes a moment for our vision to
adjust We adjust the exposure until we can JUST see Frank’s
open eyes staring back at us

Henry’s breath quickens Frank nods Henry attempts to calm
himself before tip toeing back to bed

INT HENRY’S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING 64

Henry gets out of bed Was last night a dream He walks over
to his HAMSTER CAGE and feeds his pet JOE Then steps out

INT TOP OF STAIRS - SAME 65

Henry looks into his mother’s room Adele is sleeping One
wrist in evidence still restrained to the bed post

At the bottom of the stairs he looks into the living room
Evidence of Frank having slept the night on the couch

INT KITCHEN ADELE’S HOUSE - SAME 66

Henry looks around but Frank is nowhere to be seen The back
door is open The sound of the cicadas whispers in Henry
wonders for a moment Is that it Is he gone We can tell
he kind of misses him when

Frank emerges from the basement

FRANK
Couldnt find any eggs

Henry whips around as Frank steps over to the oven and opens
it He’s made a makeshift splint out of a wooden spoon and a
dish rag Frank strains as he removes a tray of biscuits from
the oven his appendix scar staining his shirt

HENRY
We don’t stock up much on
groceries Mostly canned goods

Henry walks passed the chair that Adele occupied the night
before rope still tied to the legs

FRANK
Youve got enough room in back for
chickens Three or four nice little
Rhode Island Reds

INT KITCHEN ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 68

Henry goes to cut open the biscuit with a knife Frank
quickly grabs the knife from his hand For a moment it seems
like a defensive move but instead

FRANK
(appalled)
Never slice a biscuit
(tearing one open with his
hands )
You want to pull them apart so you
get all the surfaces

There is something undeniably fatherly about this moment that
is foreign to Henry

Frank notices Henry trying to eye the front of the NEWSPAPER
It features the prison photo of Frank from TV
FRANK
I don’t blame you for wondering Just
know there’s more to this story than
youll see in that paper there

Henry stops looking

FRANK (CONTD)
You got brothers or sisters

HENRY
No um my mom tried but

Frank takes this in without reacting

HENRY (CONTD)
I’ve got a stepbrother and a half-
sister My dad takes me out to
dinner with them on Sundays

FRANK
How does a fellow let a woman like
your mother get away

HENRY
He got together with his secretary

FRANK
Huh Good riddance

Henry works up the confidence to ask a question

HENRY
How did you escape

FRANK
I told the guard at the hospital if
he left I was going to jump out
the window He heard that and went
to have a smoke Nothing misleads
people like the truth

ADELE (0C)
Good morning

Frank and Henry turn to see Adele enter the room

ADELE (CONT’D)
What are those

HENRY
Biscuits They’re amazing

Henry’s joy for his breakfast makes Adele cautious

Adele offers her wrists to Frank for binding

FRANK
I don’t think we’ll be needing that
any longer But if the day comes
when you have to say I tied you up
you won’t be lying
(another thought)
Haven’t heard any trains go by

ADELE
Holiday weekend Might be a funny
schedule
FRANK
(offering a biscuit)

She wants to resist the invitation

HENRY
You have to try them

Adele submits to the biscuit Tries to suppress a smile

wrench from a screwdriver

FRANK (CONTD)
Hey Hank

H

After a beat Frank slides out Henry sits there a bit
embarrassed Frank understands immediately He points to the
side of the wrench that’s closed

FRANK (CONTD)
Socket wrench

Frank disappears under the car

Music comes up as we begin a quiet montage of Frank doing
chores around the house Henry is by his side for everything

Frank stands over Henry’s shoulder placing the BASEBALL in

Adele watches from a window

FRANK
Before you can throw a ball you
need to know how to hold a ball
How to feel the stitches

Frank turns the ball in Henry’s hand till his fingers line up
with the red stitches

FRANK (CONTD)
You feel that

INT KITCHEN ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 77

Frank sits at the kitchen table his twisted ankle up on
another chair Adele is hemming the ripped pant cuff being
careful not to poke Frank with the needle

FRANK
(to Adele)
You bite your lip when you sew

ADELE
I’m trying not to stick you

FRANK
(re a scar on her knee)
How’d you get this

ADELE

through rehearsal they got rid of
the ramp I tapped myself right off

Frank touches the scar tenderly Henry watches his mother
carefully Everyone seems to have forgotten

KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK - A banging at the kitchen door that
leads to the side of the house We see a SILHOUETTE of a man
in the window of the split kitchen door

All three stop We can almost see the vein in Frank’s neck
raise His eyes go dead serious

Henry looks - Frank is holding Adele’s wrist Her hands shake
FRANK
Answer the door Henry Let’‘em know
your mother’s out
Frank pulls Henry in for a second
FRANK (CONTD)
(quietly serious)
I know I can trust you not to get
nervous and say something you’d regret

Henry nods The day’s activities suddenly erased

KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK

Henry walks over to the kitchen door as Frank and Adele curl
behind a corner where they can’t be seen Perhaps Frank
stands just out of sight his hand holding the back of
Henry’s shirt as a reminder of his presence

Henry opens the top half of the kitchen door revealing his
neighbor MR JERVIS A friendly man in his 50’s carrying a
BUCKET OF PEACHES It’s clear that he has a thing for Adele

MR JERVIS
Oh hi Henry I was looking for your
mother

HENRY

I’m sorry Mr Jervis She’s not home
right now

Mr Jervis gives a disappointed look Adele is always home

MR JERVIS
Oh Well that’s not like her
Has she been following the news
She leave you here by yourself

HENRY
I just mean she can’t come to the
door She’s taking a bath

MR JERVIS
Aaah

HENRY
(re the peaches)
Are those for her

MR JERVIS
Yeah got so many of these didn’t
know what to do Thought your mother
might like them

Jervis hands Henry the peaches

HENRY
Thank you I’m sure she’1ll
appreciate them

MR JERVIS
(not letting up)
Sure she’s not around There’s
something I’d like to discuss with
her

HENRY
Can I give her a message

MR JERVIS

(hesitates)
Look Henry there’s some
I’m not sure if you heard but
there’s a guy loose - just broke
out of Stinchfield He’s probably
long gone by now but until they
find him I just wouldn’t be
opening the door without an adult

Henry measures his response

HENRY
Thank you for telling me
(a thought)
What did he do
MR JERVIS
Some pretty awful things son
(thinks )
He
HENRY
What
MR JERVIS

(immediately regrets

telling Henry)
Look I doubt he’s anywhere near here
by now Just remember I’m right
across the street You have any
problems just give me a jingle

Mr Jervis exits and Henry closes the door
Adele and Frank enter the room and size up the peaches
HENRY
(sets down the peaches)
He had more than he needed
Frank senses Henry’s apprehension
FRANK
(pats him on the shoulder)
You did good Hank

Henry smiles proudly Adele shows concern

ADELE
Henry why don’t you go check on Joe

HENRY
I’m sure he’s fine

ADELE
It’s a hot day Make sure his water
hasn’t dried up

Henry leaves Once he’s gone Adele summons up some courage
and confronts Frank

A beat as

ADELE (CONTD)
You can’t do that again

FRANK
What did I

ADELE
My son is not your look out

Frank and Adele stare each other down
ADELE (CONTD)

He’s not your accomplice and I don’t
want him doing that again

Frank tightens up Does she remember who I am

of his pet hamster Joe He can still hear the warble of Frank

(however)
There hasn’t been a man in this house
for a while now I see how he looks at
you What he wants That encouragement
a pat on his shoulder so badly And I
want it for him But not for that

FRANK
I can’t promise what’s going to
show up at the door
ADELE
(believe me)
I know
A beat

FRANK
Okay then

A look between the two of them resolves the conversation
Frank grabs a peach takes a bite
FRANK (CONTD)
Good peach Too bad they’re all so
ripe Never get through ‘em all
ADELE
We should throw away most of em
before they rot
FRANK
I have another idea

Frank scoops three cups of FLOUR into a bowl Follows it with
a pinch of SALT

ADELE

86 INT ADELE’S KITCHEN 86
Henry slaps down the stick of BUTTER next to a can of CRISCO

FRANK
Hank before you sits one of the
great dilemmas of life Sure butter
has superior flavor but nothing
beats lard for flakiness All your
life you’1l meet people who will
try to convince you of one over the
other What do you think we do

Henry thinks hard

HENRY
Use both

holds Adele’s hand Adele holds Henry’s hand and Henry holds
the fork as they cut the butterlard into the flour

much attention to recipes and you
forget how to feel It’s like
reading a book on gardening when
all you got to do is get dirt
underneath your fingernails It’s
like dancing right Adele

Frank and Adele share a smile

Frank pulls a pitcher of water from the fridge and begins to
sparingly add it to the contents of the bowl

FRANK (CONT’D)

they get a perfect looking ball of
dough but nobody’s giving prizes
for that Might as well be eating
cardboard

of crumbling at any moment

Henry mixes it with his hands before Frank grabs the dough
and drops it on a piece of wax paper

Just a little more sugar Not too
sweet

Frank sprinkles a little cinnamon over the chopped peaches
And after a good minute of commotion everything now stops
Frank is holding a WAX PAPER SHEET with the top layer of dough
It needs to be flipped on top of the pie but theyve made it
so flaky that it looks as though it could go everywhere

Henry is holding his hamster Joe His fellow prisoner He
says good night to his pet and moves to his bed

The room goes dead quiet We hear only the sounds coming from
Adele’s room The adjustments of two people in bed together
for the first time A preamble of noises that are not easily
discernible Henry tries to interpret what sounds like

Footsteps short thuds A sheet untucked A hand
grabbing a bed frame A bed spring

We slowly descend over Henry holding his baseball well
aware of the wall that separates us from Adele’s room The
bed noises continue Not in a profane way Rather a new
couple finding their rhythm

Rhythm This was the word that
burrowed into my brain as I listened
to their late night conversation
quietly dissipate I thought about

mooooom and all the good times youve
had here

HENRY
Hey Barry how’s it going

Barry gurgles back Syllables lost in saliva

EVELYN
Please One mother to another I
wouldn’t ask if I wasn’t desperate

A long beat before Adele drops her shoulders

ADELE
Okay

EVELYN

Thank you thank you thank you I
owe you

night It’s about two hours drive

And just like that she’s gone

Henry pulls Barry’s chair into the entryway and Adele shuts
the door

Frank walks into the room We’re not quite sure what he
thinks of all this for a second And then

FRANK
Hey Barry you look mighty toasty
in all those clothes

Barry is SWEATING in a parka

Frank lowers Barry into a LAWN CHAIR then unbrims his RED
SOX HAT from Pricemart and slides it onto Barry’s head who
gurgles back with joy

FRANK
I’m Frank by the way

Barry GURGLES back a sound that vaguely resembles FWAANN
FRANK (CONTD)
That’s right Frank Pleasure to
meet you

Frank walks over to Henry who is gloving his new baseball

FRANK (CONTD)
Alright let’s see that arm

HENRY
Don’t get your hopes up

away from each other Frank pauses then throws it right into
Henry’s glove with a little heat

in the backyard toss the ball A moment later it is thrown
back strong and true by someone out of Jervis’s sight-line
He frowns

the day Henry practices his new grip of the baseball

Frank enters with a cold washcloth and pats Barry’s forehead
Then the back of his neck It’s an incredibly tender act that
has as much effect on Adele and Henry as it does on Barry

The movie fades out and a teaser for the LATE NEWS comes up

a murderer

ADELE
(wants to believe)
The man I’ve met doesn’t seem
capable

Adele looks deep into Frank’s eyes Their bond is so strong
that Henry doesn’t dare move or make a sound They could stay
like this all night but HEADLIGHTS cut across the window

They look outside to see Evelyn’s station wagon pull up
outside Without a word Frank begins up the stairs

ADELE (CONTD)
Alright Barry looks like your
mother is here

Adele opens the front door as Evelyn makes her way in

Henry finishes brushing his teeth He rinses off the brush
and goes to leave when he hears murmuring from his mother’s
bedroom As Henry gets closer to the door we begin to hear
the conversation

ADELE (0OC
You were so young Why didn’t you
appeal

FRANK (0C
Don’t know Thought I got what I
deserved

ADELE (0C

You don’t still feel that now

FRANK (0C
Now it doesn’t matter

ADELE (0OC
Were you scared

FRANK (0C
In prison Sure

ADELE (0C
No when you jumped

FRANK (0C
Oh
(gives it a thought)
Didn’t even think about it

Henry slowly opens the door until he can peek into the room
Frank is lying shirtless on the bed Adele lies across him
with her head on his chest She’s slowly tracing the scar on
his abdomen with COTTON AND ANTISEPTIC

ADELE
I can’t imagine not being free

FRANK
Can’t call myself free till I can
walk down the street Arm around you

ADELE
Id like that

FRANK
Take you on road trips to places we
don’t know a soul
ADELE
Like on the run

FRANK
Yeah Bonnie On the run

This catches Henry’s attention
After a beat something occurs to Adele

ADELE
I bet they wouldn’t care who you
were in Nova Scotia

FRANK
In Canada

ADELE
Or Prince Edward Island Nobody
bothers you up there

FRANK
You been

ADELE
Once when I was little It’s
beautiful Villages and beaches and
salt water marshes Someone could

Youre a tough guy I think you
could take it

FRANK
Too cold to grow things

ADELE
It’s mostly farms

FRANK
Sounds nice

Henry begins to imagine it himself

A beat as they all soak in Prince Edward Island

FRANK (CONTD)
I noticed a spot under the shower
where the water’s finding its way
under the linoleum Don’t want dry
rot Going to tackle that tomorrow

ADELE
Maybe it doesn’t matter

INT HENRY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 130

Henry in bed Lost in thought We hear sounds coming from the
next room Muffled sounds that could be sex and yet could
easily be something else And then We’re in a dream

INT CLASSROOM - DAY

The same one in which we found Henry checking out Rachel
Only now it’s empty and the girl seated before him is Eleanor
from the grocery store She stands up and turns around
Stares into his naive eyes

ELEANOR
What do you want to do

HENRY
I don’t know

She unbuttons her blouse revealing nothing Like a ghost
we can see the classroom behind Eleanor between the opening
in her blouse Henry pauses He simply doesn’t have the life
experience to fill in the information
ELEANOR
I think you know Come on Just
say it

We see flashes of women from the covers of magazines and
billboards Women staring with desire in their eyes

Back to Eleanor

ELEANOR (CONTD)
What’s the matter

She laughs
Just as Henry is completely overwhelmed we

nearby washing dishes

ADELE
How’d you sleep

HENRY
Fine How about you

Adele and Frank share a laugh Henry doesn’t quite get it He
doesn’t like being outside the joke Particularly when it
comes to his mom

ADELE
Well I was wondering if you could
do me a little favor

FRANK
A little top secret research if
you follow

HENRY
(Skeptical Feeling
replaced)
Research on what

ADELE
Just a little trip to the library to
find a book on Prince Edward Island
It’s a place in Canada your
grandparents used to take me

HENRY
What for

ADELE
Well Frank can’t stay here
forever

HENRY
You’re going to Canada

FRANK
(to Henry)
Your mom says it’s beautiful

ADELE
I’ve always meant to take you there
Can you pick up the book Hank

Henry looks at his mom Now she’s using the nickname
FRANK

Youd be doing your mother and me a
big favor

EXT SUBURBAN STREET - DAY 134
Henry rides his bike He passes multiple front yard cook
outs We’re reminded of the long weekend by the amount of get-
togethers and picnics and slip-n-slides

EXT LIBRARY - DAY 135
Henry pulls up to a weekend library sale Older literary
types and kids go through bins of used books and tables of
homemade pastries Henry cycles past and parks in an empty
bike stand

INT LIBRARY — DAY 136
Henry uses the card catalogue

Henry follows the Dewey Decimals til he reaches a thin volume

on Prince Edward Island He also grabs a couple general
Canada books

Henry sits down at a research desk There’s only one other
person in the room Eleanor She sits on a leather chair

chewing on a braid reading a book

HENRY
(a soft try)

So you found one of our city’s hot spots

Eleanor looks up and just stares at Henry like he’s crazy

HENRY (CONTD)
(immediately embarrassed)
Um we talked at the grocery

I’m sorry I didn’t mean to

ELEANOR
No that was good Confidence is a
very attractive quality in a man

This throws Henry off further He attempts small talk

HENRY
Oh okay So do you go to school
around here

ELEANOR
I just moved here from Chicago I’m
supposed to try out living with my
dad this year

HENRY
Oh what happened

A beat as Eleanor considers whether or not to get into it

ELEANOR
The official reason is I have an
eating disorder and they’re hoping
a new school environment will help
but really I think my mom just
wanted to get rid of me so she can
fool around with her boyfriend

HENRY
I understand This guy just moved
in with my mom and me

ELEANOR
And she didn’t even consult you
did she

HENRY

No I mean he kind of just showed up

ELEANOR
And now he wants you out

HENRY
I don’t think so

ELEANOR
He will So they can have sex

HENRY
I think they already are

ELEANOR
So the clock is ticking

Eleanor gives the motion of a ticking clock before returning
to her book

HENRY
What are you reading

ELEANOR
I’m investigating my legal rights
You see I got into the this really
great private school where they
mainly focus on drama no one cares
about sports or what kind of
clothes you wear The teachers stay
off your case It’s really
elevated But at the last minute
my parents said they didn’t have
the money

HENRY
Could they get a loan

ELEANOR
Oh they have the money They’re
just using me as a pawn in their
sick little game I wrote a letter
to the school Asked if I could
exchange services for tuition
Janitorial Whatever I haven’t
received a response

Henry moves over to her with his books

ELEANOR (CONTD)
How about you

HENRY
It’s for my mother She wants to
know if Canada might be a good
place to move
ELEANOR
How do you feel about that Moving
Leaving your friends I’m asking
because that’s what I had to do and
frankly I consider it child abuse

HENRY
I don’t know Canada seems nice

ELEANOR
Do you even know if they’re taking you

HENRY
My mom wouldn’t leave me behind

ELEANOR
When people have sex with each
other it affects their brains They
can’t see things normally It’s
like a drug

HENRY
I’m not sure if that’s true

ELEANOR
Look it up It’s clinically proven
You can’t blame her It’s like he
cast a spell on her or something
With his penis

Henry tries not to react to her saying this word

HENRY
I can hear them in the night
Saying each other’s names

ELEANOR
So he’s a sex addict You don’t
have an Oedipus complex where you
want to marry your mom do you

HENRY
(quickly)
No I like regular girls I like my
mom in the mom way

ELEANOR
(measuring him)
Right
(back to business)
Well you’re probably going to need
an intervention Maybe even need to
deprogram her

HENRY
Deprogram her

ELEANOR
Yeah
(a thought)
This guy Does he have charisma

HENRY
(he does)
I think so

Eleanor just nods

ELEANOR
Too bad your mom and my dad couldn’t
get together before this boyfriend
person showed up Of course then if
you and I got married it would be
kind of like incest

HENRY
My mother doesn’t normally date anyway

ELEANOR
I see only one hope for you You

need to find a way to get him out
of your life

HENRY
I don’t know if that’s possible

ELEANOR
Either you get rid of him Or he’1l
probably get rid of you

This lands heavily on Henry

EXT SIDE YARD ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 137

might seem suspicious

ADELE (0C
Wed just start driving Just like
that

FRANK (0C
You wouldn’t be able to tell your
friends

ADELE (0C
No one to tell really
(a thought)
My ex-husband would never let me
take Henry away

FRANK (0C)
You know what that would mean

Henry waits for the ending of this thought when Frank rounds
the corner with a stripping knife

FRANK (CONTD)
Hey you just get back

HENRY

ADELE
(enters )
Hey kiddo

Frank and Adele share a sweet moment It upsets Henry

FRANK

nick of time We’re giving the
porch a new coat Want to help
scrape the paint with me

ADELE
Frank thinks we could knock out
this job in no time if we all
pitched in

We can read Henry’s lack of trust

HENRY
No thanks

Adele is confused

ADELE
I thought it would be a fun project
for us to do together You could
fill us in on what you learned at
the library

Henry thinks about what he learned Brainwashing
Deprogramming Frank places a firm hand on Henry’s shoulder

FRANK
I think you should help your mother
here son

Henry looks back at Frank

HENRY
Stop pretending to be my dad

Frank withdraws his hand Henry leaves the room

ADELE

Henry settles in front of the TV The Jerry Lewis Telethon is

Frank’s face is on the cover again He picks it up

ADULT HENRY (VO)
If price were an indication of how
intent the police were on capturing a
suspect they sure wanted Frank bad

Big words spell out that there is now a TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR
REWARD for Frank’s capture

ADULT HENRY (VO)
Ten thousand dollars I could buy a
dirt bike A video camera A
paintball gun

We see catalogue images of each of these items

FRANK (0C)
Not a very flattering picture

Henry drops the paper as he notices Frank standing above him
holding the paint scraper

FRANK (CONTD)
I was thinking we could throw
around the ball for a bit

good move

MARJORIE
I know how your mother feels about
dancing but people might get the
wrong idea

GERALD
They might think

RICHARD
They might think you were gay

MARJORIE
Richie

HENRY
Or they might think I liked girls
in tights

Richard is actually getting a kick out of this new side of
Henry Gerald switches gears

GERALD
You two are reaching that stage of
life Probably time for us to have
a little man-to-man conversation

RICHARD
I already had that with my real dad

GERALD
(to Henry)
That just leaves you and me

HENRY
It’s okay I’m up to speed

basics but there are some things a
guy needs to find out from a man

MARJORIE
It can be difficult if you don’t
have a man around the house

HENRY
(quietly)
Who says I don’t

MARJORIE
(sighs)
Before you know it you two boys
will probably start going out on
dates Couple of lady-killers If I
was still in seventh grade Id
think you two were the cutest

body It’s for the better They have
better cemeteries there Say what you
want about the French people - They
know how to celebrate their dead

polish on her bitten down nails

I told my dad I was meeting a boy
and he gave me this whole lecture
like we were going to do it ina
coffee shop or something

HENRY
I hate when my mom tries to talk to me
about sex Every time she says stuff
it’s like she’s trying to pronounce
some difficult medical term

ELEANOR
(relates)
That’s so annoying My dad can’t say
vagina He literally can’t say it
(imitating her father)
I trust your mother is covering all
questions relating to your parts

HENRY
(imitating his mother)
Henry never feel shame about
your penis It’s just a body
part Like an arm

The waitress shoots them a look from across the diner

ELEANOR
Like an arm

HENRY
One time I fell while trying to
hop a fence and she came running
over and was like Did you hurt
your penis

penis We should probably put ice
on it

ADELE
Let me take a look

FRANK
It’s fine I’m fine

ADELE
If this is going to work you need
to let me take care of you

Frank sees the sincerity in Adele’s eyes He turns and lifts
his shirt to reveal the SCAR from his appendectomy You don’t
need to be a doctor to tell - It’s infected

ADELE (CONTD)
You need medicine

FRANK
It can wait

ADELE
No you need penicillin I’1l send
Henry to the Pharmacy

It’s okay I trust you You go

ADELE
I shouldnt

FRANK

run for it

ELEANOR
Or maybe he was just waiting for
you to leave the house So they
could run off together

HENRY
I don’t think my mom would leave
without saying goodbye

ELEANOR
It’s just like Bonnie and Clyde

HENRY
Who

ELEANOR
They made a movie about them Bonnie
was this woman who was bored because
she hadn’t had sex in a long time
This guy Clyde just showed up one day
and took her away They drove all
around holding up banks and living
out of their car Odd thing was
Clyde couldn’t even have sex but he
had so much charisma it didn’t even
matter

HENRY
What happened to them

ELEANOR
In the end they got killed

Henry’s face falls as Eleanor goes on to describe the

since you’re a kid but youd see
the whole thing It would be pretty
traumatic

It replays through Henry’s mind Eleanor stands up

ELEANOR (CONTD)
I have this really weird feeling
There’s this thing I keep wanting to
do only you’d think I was strange

HENRY
(a lie)
I don’t think you’re strange

Eleanor licks her lips Then she leans in and kisses Henry
After a moment she pulls away

ELEANOR

I bet you never did that before
Now youll always remember I was
the first girl you ever kissed

cross the border

Frank walks into the entryway and stops

HENRY
We’ll have to smuggle him then I
can put him under my shirt

checking everything The police
would arrest Frank maybe us We
just can’t take the chance

But he’s part of our family

want And Frank just pretends

ELEANOR
He just wants to get in good with
her You guys are his ticket

HENRY
They think they’re in charge of me

ELEANOR
You know you do have the power to
change things You could really
stick it to both of them

Henry’s face rejects the idea

HENRY
I couldn’t do that to her

ELEANOR
For a while shed be sad Eventually
she’d thank you You could get rich
you know

HENRY
They shouldn’t reward people for
doing that kind of thing

Eleanor runs a hand down the front of Henry’s shirt

ELEANOR
One thing I love about you Henry
is how kind you are

HENRY
I just don’t want anyone to get hurt

Eleanor gets close enough to Henry that we hear her breath

an erection

Don’t you think we should know each
other a little more

ELEANOR
If you’re worried about me getting
pregnant you don’t need to I haven’t
had my period in a few months

Eleanor reaches down By the look on Henry’s face we know
that she has him in her hand

ELEANOR (CONTD)

You know what will happen if you
don’t report him They’1ll take you
away and we won’t ever get to see
each other anymore I might stop
eating again They’1ll send me back
to the clinic

You were a second ago

HENRY
Maybe it only works when it’s
supposed to
She lets go
EVELYN
(a little cruel)
Or maybe it’s broken You might
want to get it checked

She scoffs and starts to walk away

Henry quickly zips up

HENRY
Maybe you should get checked

Eleanor turns for one last stab

ELEANOR
I thought you were different I
didn’t realize you were just a
pathetic impotent little boy

and a pen He writes Dear Dad

his father once all of this has come to an end somehow

OFFICER TREADWELL (CONT’D)
So what are you doing out here in

HENRY
- I left something at my father’s

shaking She holds back Just long enough to get a
questioning look from the officer when

Henry takes the officer’s hand An odd look for a second

OFFICER TREADWELL (CONT’D)

them over

TELLER
Good morning Nice to see you in

TELLER

baby in a frontpack Her breathing becomes slightly irregular

Henry observes his mother Trying to keep it together

INT ENTRYWAY ADELE’S HOUSE - DAY 233

INT BANK —- DAY 236

Adele hides her shaking hands under the counter Henry sees
them but keeps his eyes on the manager Now the baby begins
crying With each cry we can almost feel Adele’s will being
slowly cracked away

BANK MANAGER
It’s just a somewhat unusual
situation having a person withdraw
this much in cash

ADELE
It just seems handier

BANK MANAGER
Normally when transferring funds
of this quantity our clients
prefer a cashier’s check

Adele desperately doesn’t want to arouse suspicion

ADELE
I simply prefer cash I don’t
really get out much anymore

The manager studies this response trying to figure her out

BANK MANAGER
Some would even call this kind of
withdrawal a little suspicious

We can tell Adele is at her breaking point when

HENRY
Actually we’ve packed up all our
things We’re emptying our bank
account and making a run for the
border like Bonnie and Clyde

A long beat The manager takes one look at this impossible
duo of runaways and CRACKS UP The teller joins in Adele
incredulous attempts a laugh Frank was right No one
believes the truth

BANK MANAGER
Of course you are Come on Muriel
let’s not keep our friends here
waiting any longer

The manager scribbles a signature on something The teller
begins counting out bills Hundreds followed by twenties
Henry watches as the cash is fanned out in front of him

TELLER

all in

Adele’s shoulders are shaking
Henry watches as Frank walks Adele over to a kitchen chair
The same one from the beginning of the film The ropes are

still attached to the arms and legs of the chair

Frank sits Adele down This makes Adele begin to inhale quickly
The way one does before crying but she refuses to cry

Frank ties each ankle to a chair leg Kissing each one after
pulling the knot tight

He then ties her wrists behind her back He takes a breath

possessions He quickly yanks out a couple feet of tape and
begins wrapping Henry’s legs to the chair
