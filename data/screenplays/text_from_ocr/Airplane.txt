Excuse me sir Theres been a little
problem in the cockpit and I was
wondering

STRIKER
The cockpit What is it

RANDY
Its the little room at the front of the
plane where the pilots sit But thats not
important right now The first officer is
ill and the Captain would like someone
with flying experience to help him with
the radio Do you know anything about
planes

The Indian holds the match awaiting the outcome

STRIKER
Well I flew in the war but that was a
long time ago I wouldnt know anything
about it

RANDY
Would you go up please

He has a moment of indecision The Indian encourages Striker
with an adamant nod Striker gets up to leave The Indian
relieved blows out the match
