2 EXT DAY STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS 2

Andy Cobb early thirties is digging an English garden in
the hot sun He is lean naked to the waist Its hard to
tell which century he inhabits Only when he stops to drink
from a plastic bottle do we realise he is of our time

TESS (VO)

And love slipped the bonds of

restraint

At a table under a willow tree sits Tess - early fifties

funky specs - at a laptop She pauses in her typing
at Andy

TESS (VO) (CONTD)

Underneath a converted barn cross-legged on a bench ina
bikini top sits Eustacia She is hunched over a note pad
writing at tremendous speed oblivious to all but her work

GLEN (VO)

This complex contemporary matrix is

modernism

He regards it

GLEN
Crap
He deletes it He looks at his blank screen breathing
deeply The only words left say “Chapter Six

NICHOLAS (V0O)

Inchcombe had seen it all before
Hed seasoned it the metallic
smell of blood and gunshot
forensics hunched like vultures
The dreadful mundanity of murder
he thought

Nicholas Hardiment writes fluidly with pencil and paper A
good-looking man of fifty Dark hair strong figure

total integrity

Who did you base him on Nicholas

NICHOLAS

(IGNORING GLEN)

My books dont say anything

profound I cant pretend to be an

intellectual - not like Glen here

illuminating our ignorance with his

critical glow - but I do love prose

And I think I can turn a reasonable

story
Glen peers into the kitchen Beth is serving desserts

GLEN
Excuse me
He goes to help her leaving the ladies around Nicholas like
cups around a teapot
GLEN

BETH

GLEN

three hours The time just
vanished

BETH

GLEN
I feel like a man whos just passed
a gargantuan stool

BETH
Super Sprig of mint on the top
Glen returns to the dining room with two desserts He
listens
to Nicholas as he serves them

NICHOLAS
The real secret of being a writer
is learning how to lie
A frisson of shock goes round the lady writers

NICHOLAS (CONTD)
Because thats what storytellers
are Thieves and liars

GLEN

“The basis of all excellence is
truth Samuel Johnson
Glens intellect wins the day Nicholas smarts
