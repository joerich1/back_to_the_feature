INVESTORS

The offering of REPO MAN is a Limited Partnership Agreement
with Edge City Productions as the General Partner This
financial structure allows the Investor to take an Investment
Tax Credit for his or her at-risk participation and to
depreciate their respective share of the feature entity
without any liability other than the moneys invested The
particular appeal or this offering is that Investors whose
venture capital sets the production in motion will receive
their percentage of a 50 profit participation based solely
on their 44 capitalization ot the overall cost (This 50
profit participation is customarily contingent upon 100
capitalization of the project cost) This uniquely
advantageous arrangement is made possible by the fact that
31 of the capitalized cost of the film is being deferred
with no profit participation and the balance is being
donated by UCLA Any other profit participation points
deemed necessary in the judgement of the producers to secure
name talent etc will be taken on a one-to-one basis from

the Producers and Investors net profits

The General Partner will provide income statements and
balance sheets to the Limited Partners each year and will

set up an individual account with each Partner
PAGE 8
INVESTORS (CONT)

Film making is of course a risky venture even when the
production is insured against lab damage and equipment loss
As such it is best suited to venture capital since there
is always a possibility of project failure and loss of
investment funds However in the case of REPO MAN the
producers and participants are working on an absolute
minimum deferred salary basis and hence have a personal
stake in seeing the production completed on schedule
within budget and realizing a profit We believe it is
exactly this personal interest on the part of cast and
crew which makes REPO MAN such a potentially profitable

venture

DISTRIBUTION MARKETING

Independent feature films are in an advantageous profit
position today partially because they can be produced
for drastically less than comparable studio features
(whose biggest expense is always salaries) but also
because of the rapid growth of exploitable markets

A feature film is no longer susceptible to the whims of
US theatrical distribution now that other markets --
specifically Network Television Syndicated Television
Public Broadcasting Foreign Television Pay TV and the
relatively new development of Videocassette and Videodisc
markets -- act as additional sources of potential income
Cable TV has a voracious appetite for new product and is
proving a significant component of the independent feature

profit profile

revenues generated by the average independent feature

As a result of this broadening expanse of distribution
markets the income-producing lifespan of an independent

feature is greater today than it has ever been

Nuclear Winter Is Already Here—a Cold Winter of the Soul

By JOHN E MACK

- There have been a number of films in the
last two years—such as “The Day After”
“Testament” “The Road Warrior” and
“Threads”—that confront the threat of
nuclear war by providing visions of life
sher the weapons have been detonated

But it occurred to me while watching
“Repo Man” (the title refers to the em-
ployees of a fraudulent company that
“repossesges” cars) that we live in a post-
nuclear world even though the bombs have
not gone off Nuclear weapons already are
taking a moral spiritual psychological and
physical toil

In the film the character of J Frank
Parnell a middle-aged scientist is first
seen mysteriously driving a 1964 Chevrolet

terrestrial aliens whose matter is capable of
disintegrating—in a blast of heat and
radiation—anyone one who opens the lid leav-
ing only their boots smoking on the road
The driver weaves along the highway
sweating and drained as the heat from the
matter in the trunk penetrates the car

‘ Parnell tells Otto the troubled young
punkish hero of the film in anguished tones
that his mind is eroding He reveals that he

has worked on the neutron
born which drove him mad after which

says destroys people and leaves buildings
standing “Fits in a suitcase No one knows
it’s there until blammo Eyes melt skin
explodes Everyone dead It’s so immoral
working on the thing can drive you mad”
As Parnell deteriorates further mentally
the heat from the aliens in the trunk
exhausts his body until finally he dies
discarded on a bench

The movie is set in the post-industrial
ruins of downtown Log Angeles amid

forth a variety of formulas for salvation ina
world that is out of their control

“Repo Man” depicts the physical and
moral desecration that results from perpet-
ually committing the planets resources to
nuclear annihilation instead of to the
benefit of mankind We now even seem to
have post-nuclear war zones in New York
Los Angeles and other cities as whole
neighborhoods sections of our nation that
the new prosperity has passed by dis-
integrate for lack of basic resources The
poor must do without adequate medical
care and infant death rates rise as health
centers close and billions more are devoted
to instruments of destruction The increas-
ing number of homeless in our cities have
become the refugees of a potential war for
which we are

buildings including two single-room-

occupancy hotels that formerly housed
poor people were demolished without 2
city permit The motive reportedly was

beat a legislative deadline that would have
placed a moratorium on profitable luxury
conversion of such properties Since appar-
ently no attempt was made to disconnect
water and gas lines much of the block—
and the people in it—could have been
blown away

As many of our young people grow older
afraid they may have

lasting
ments to a future that they doubt they will
ever see For one rock-music group the
Sex Pistols “no future” a line from one of
their songs became virtually a motto
When governments take the lead in

behavior may become permisail
justification for this—the activity of anoth-
er nuclear superpower—seems inadequate
as the proliferation of nuclear
weapons does little to what is
deplored about the alien system or
intentions The nuclear winter is already
here it is a cold winter of the soul The
bombs have not gone off but are neverthe-
less affecting our moral and spiritual lives

and film such as “Repo Man” even if this is
not its intention reveals to us the

inflicting on ourselves as we threaten to
destroy our enemies and our planet It is

not too late to take responsibility with the

Soviet Union and other countries for the

going on as we are is that the loss of caring
may permit the last destructive act
