In other parts of the world young
men of promise leave home to make
their fortunes battle evil or solve

A man and woman (COUPLE 1) make their way toward the
main

entrance of the large brick building

LARCH (VO)
Here in St Clouds I have come to
understand that promises are rarely
kept that the battle isnt so much
against evil as ignorance and that
being successful cant hold a candle
to being of use
The couple enters the orphanage where we hear the

sound of
babies

Nor have I solved the problem I came
here to solve

LARCH

You know Homer of course

Hesitant nods (They dont look as if they read)

Thats right Fuzz

Close on Fuzzy

HOMER (0S)
(continues reading)
There is something strange to me
even now in the reflection that he
never saw me

As Larch bends over Fuzzy to fix the breathing
apparatus
Fuzzy whispers

FUZZY

LARCH
(nods whispers)
Cirrhosis--its a disease of the
liver

FUZZY
Liver killed him

LARCH
Alcohol killed him--he drank himself
to death

FUZZY

EXT ST CLOUDS - NIGHT
The orphanage in moonlight Not a sound
EXT ST CLOUDS - MORNING
The children are chasing a ball near the incinerator
A VERY FRIGHTENED GIRL---not one of the orphans--is
next to the incinerator
Edna kneels by the strange girl who cringes with fear
EDNA
No ones going to hurt you dear
Have you come to visit us We have
beds you know Have you had any
breakfast Whats your name
The girl wont speak when Edna touches the girls
she pulls back her hand in alarm
INT OPERATING ROOM - MORNING
Edna is holding the head of the frightened young girl
girl is feverishly hot and whimpering she keeps

her feet in the stirrups as if shes an animal caught

trap Larch and Homer stand on either side of her

EDNA
Her temperature is a hundred and
four

LARCH

(very gently)
How old are you dear Thirteen

The girl shakes her head The pain stabs her again
LARCH

Twelve Are you twelve dear
(the girl nods)
You have to tell me how long youve
been pregnant

(the girl freezes)
Three months

Another stab of pain contorts the girl

LARCH
Are you four months pregnant

The girl holds her breath while he examines her

abdomen
Homer very delicately examines the girls abdomen too
HOMER
(whispers to Larch)
Shes at least five
The girl goes rigid as Larch bends into position
LARCH
Dear child it wont hurt when I
look Im just going to look
Homer assists Larch with the speculum
LARCH
Tell me you havent done something
to yourself have you
TWELVE-YEAR-OLD GIRL
It wasnt me
LARCH
Did you go to someone else
TWELVE-YEAR-OLD GIRL
He said he was a doctor I would
never have stuck that inside me
HOMER
Stuck what inside you
Homer holds the girl still--she is babbling on and on
while

Larch is examining her

TWELVE-YEAR-OLD GIRL
It wasnt me I would never do no
such thing I wouldnt stick that
inside me It wasnt me
Larch his wild eye peering into the speculum makes an

audible gasp from the shock of what he sees inside the
girl

Larch tells Homer to have a look Larch then whispers

something to Edna she brings the ether bottle and cone

quickly Larch starts putting the cone in place over
the

nose and mouth of the frightened girl Homer bends to
the

speculum

LARCH
(to the twelve-year-
old)
Listen youve been very brave Im
going to put you to sleep--you wont
feel it anymore Youve been brave
enough

Homer stares into the speculum he closes his eyes The
girl
is resisting the ether but her eyelids flutter closed

EDNA
Thats a heavy sedation

LARCH
You bet its a heavy sedation The
fetus is unexpelled her uterus is
punctured she has acute peritonitis
and theres a foreign object I think
its a crochet hook

Homer has pulled off his surgical mask He leans over
the
scrub sink splashing cold water on his face

LARCH

(to Homer)
If shed come to you four months ago
and asked you for a simple D and C
what would you have decided to do
Nothing This is what doing
nothing gets you Homer It means
that someone else is going to do the
job--some moron who doesnt know
how

Homer furious leaves the operating room Edna lifts
the

girls eyelids for Larch so that he can see how well
under
the ether she is
LARCH
I wish youd come to me dear child
You should have come to me instead

INT CORRIDOR - MORNING

Homer storms down the hall then stops pulling off his

white
coat Angry pacing he kicks at nothing
EXT ST CLOUDS - GRAVEYARD - EARLY MORNING
Buster and Homer are digging the pit Larch paces by
the
coffin of the 12-year-old girl
BUSTER
Whatd she die of
LARCH
(inhales deeply)
She died of secrecy she died of
ignorance
Buster nods but hes totally bewildered
LARCH
(to Homer)
If you expect people to be responsible
for their children you have to give
them the right to decide whether or
not to have children Wouldnt you
agree
Buster doesnt get it Homer has heard this too many
times

he rolls his eyes

HOMER
How about expecting people to be
responsible enough to control
themselves to begin with

LARCH
How about this child You expect
her to be responsible

Homer looks away

Homer as he talks

(sarcastic)
Doubtless youll let me know what

useful thing it is that you find

(restrained)
I wasnt intending to leave here in

Ill find some ways to be of use

LARCH
In other parts of the world I suppose
there are other ways

HOMER
(still restrained)
Of course

LARCH

Are you really so stupid that you

Mr Rose looks briefly at the men who wait for his
reaction

MR ROSE

Wally slaps Homer on the back he goes inside the cider
house
to help Rose Rose with the plumbing
WALLY
(over his shoulder)
See you later

Homer looks at Mr Rose for instructions Mr Rose
stares
back at him with his enigmatic smile

HOMER
So What should I do now

MR ROSE
Out back theres a shed Its just
a mess If that shed was better
organized I could put my truck in
there

Homer looks at Mr Rose with an uncomprehending
expression

MR ROSE
If youre as smart as Wally says

job before you do another
Homer thinks that over
Later Homer is cleaning out the shed

he

pulls out a knife and opens it in one fluid motion
hes so

fast the knife seems to come out of nowhere He begins
to

peel the apple Homer eyes Mr Rose but Mr Roses
focus is

riveted to his apple and the long perfect strand of
peel

dangling from it

PEACHES
What kind of a name is Homer

HOMER

Homer decides to stop Another silence

MR ROSE
Now now--we all got names sensible

(to Homer)

Peaches is from Georgia where we
met him pickin peaches Hes still
better with peaches than hs is with
apples

(Peaches grins)
Jack here is new And this here is
Hero cause he was a hero of some
kind or other once Aint that right

Finished unpacking Homer sits on his bed he picks up

Expectations and begins to read Rose Rose sits down
to him watching him read Homer notices her interest

HOMER
Do you like to read

ROSE ROSE
(embarrassed)

I cant read Nobody taught me

Homer smiles politely and goes back to his book Rose

Rose
keeps looking over his shoulder at the pages
ROSE ROSE
(pointing to the page)
What does it say there
Homer looks around at the pickers lying in their beds
smoking listening (Like bedtime stories at the
orphanage
he thinks however the pickers attitude is
suspicious
reserved)
HOMER
(reading)
IT looked at the stars and considered
how awful it would be for a man to
turn his face to them as he froze to
death and see no help or pity in
all the glittering multitude
Homer looks up theres no response
HOMER
(to Rose Rose)
More
Some muttering some giggling mostly silence Rose
Rose
wants more but suddenly Jack jumps out of bed and
stomps to
the kitchen end of the cider house where a piece of
paper
is tacked to the wall Jack is talking to Homer all the
way

JACK
Since youre the one whos smart
enough to read whats this
Jack points at the piece of paper Homer gets up and
looks
at it

HOMER
Its a list of rules it seems

All the men groan--Jack swears and Peaches laughs

ROSE ROSE
Whose rules

MUDDY
Theyre for us I suppose

JACK

Go on and read em Homer

HOMER
One Please dont smoke in bed

ROSE ROSE
Its too late for that one

All the smokers laugh and cough in their beds

MR ROSE
(uncharacteristically
blunt)
Stop it Homer They arent our rules
We didnt write them I dont see no
reason to read them

HOMER
Okay

Rose Rose stomps back to her bed Her father absently
snaps
his towel

He is a goddamn psychiatrist-—-of

many apples are disappointingly mealy
I wonder of most of the apples in my
life werent meant for pies

ANGELA
Wilbur he picked them for us
himself

LARCH
(incredulous)
You dont find it depressing that
Homer Wells is picking apples

Both Edna and Angela glower at him

LARCH
Or that he cant be bothered to write
us a proper letter A dissertation
on apples we dont need

EDNA
(annoyed)
He probably doesnt make much money
picking apples--he must have had to
pay to send them too

LARCH
I wouldnt worry Edna that he
doesnt have money If he gets hungry
he can pick his dinner

Larch angrily tosses the half-eaten apple into the

EDNA
Wilbur its a gift How can you
be angry with Homer for sending us a
gift

Larch stares into space depressed Then he examines

crate and finds the mailing label that says OCEAN VIEW

too good a time

Hes makin history I suppose

From the surrounding trees the other pickers laugh

No trouble
In adjacent trees both Peaches and Hero are picking
apples

they can hear Homer and Rose Rose too (So can Mr
Rose)

PEACHES

His name is Homer Wells

INT ST CLOUDS - DINING HALL - EVENING

Edna and Angela face the Board of Trustees around a
table

Larch circles the table as everyone reads the contents
ofa

folder Larch has provided a copy for each member The
three

elderly gentlemen on the Board dont speak they just
nod
says

been
they see
expression

the

their heads to everything Dr Holtz or Mrs Goodhall

LARCH
and his pathetic resume is the
best Ive seen Though I find it
hard to believe the Board would be
interested in this character

DR HOLTZ
But he looks like an excellent young
man a first-rate candidate

LARCH
He looks like a bleeding-heart
missionary moron to me but thats
going to be the problem with any
doctor interested in coming here

MRS GOODHALL
Do you know him

LARCH
No I dont want to know him Hes
doing missionary work--in India
I wrote him weeks ago but hes
either too holy or too busy to answer
Maybe he got killed in the war

Suddenly Steerforth bursts through the door having
pushed from behind by Mary Agnes The two stop when
whats going on--not to mention Larchs stern

They back out Mary Agnes winking at Dr Holtz before
door closes Mrs Goodhall is ready to continue

MRS GOODHALL
I fail to see how someone courageous
enough to make a commitment to a
foreign mission is automatically to
be dismissed--that part of the world
requires precisely the kind of
dedication that is needed here

LARCH
Does it snow in Bombay One winter
here and well be shipping him south
in a coffin
MRS GOODHALL
You cant think that a man who has
served under such conditions as
exist over there will be in the
slightest daunted by a little snow--
have you no idea how harsh and
primitive and full of disease that
part of the world is

LARCH
Then I suppose we can look forward
to catching various diseases from
him

DR HOLTZ
But Dr Larch he seems exceptionally
qualified

LARCH
Im not talking about his medical
qualifications Its the Christian
thing that bothers me--I just dont
see it being of much use around
here

MRS GOODHALL
(bitterly)
I fail to see how a little
Christianity could hurt anyone
here

LARCH
Anyway I was just showing you this
guy as an example of whats available--
I didnt think youd be interested

DR HOLTZ
Were very interested

MRS GOODHALL
Yes very

DR HOLTZ
You wouldnt be opposed to meeting
with him

LARCH
I suppose it wouldnt hurt to meet
him Whats his name again

ANGELA
Dr Homer Wells
LARCH
(mumbling)
I just hope he wont expect us to
say Grace all the time

The three elderly gentlemen repeat the name

Its a nice name very New England

DR HOLTZ

name

treasure Homer continues unpacking He pulls his X ray
and puts it aside

BUSTER

Homer turns to see Buster Mary Agnes Angela and Edna
the doorway

MARY AGNES

ANGELA

Homer smiles he nods
in

somber

and
as if

his

reassuring

Angela and Mary Agnes start to put Homers things back
his bag Edna picks up the X ray and looks at it with a
expression

EDNA

HOMER

sympathetically

INT LARCHS OFFICE - NIGHT

Homer looks at his fake diplomas they are now framed
hanging on the office wall Homer surveys the office
for the first time he sits down in the desk chair as
slowly getting used to his new position

INT BOYS DIVISION - NIGHT

Homer reads to the boys from David Copperfield While

voice is strong--positive optimistic certainly
misses
two

title of

familiar
hall
hall
and

imitation

the

again

to the boys--there is in the conclusion of the chapter
something that distracts him He seems to hesitate he

a line or two and perhaps he purposely skips one or
others (Possibly Homers eyes wander ahead to the
the next chapter I Make Another Beginning)

HOMER
Thus I began my new life in a new
name and with everything new about
me I felt like one in a dream
The remembrance of that life is
fraught with so much want of
hope Whether it lasted for a year
or more or less I do not know I
only know that it was and ceased to
be and there I leave it

Homer stops and looks at the boys faces

CURLY
What happens next

Homer smiles
HOMER
Thats tomorrow Curly Lets mot
give the story away
Homer puts out the lights and leaves the boys in the
semi-darkness Seconds later the closed door to the
is flung open flooding the room with light from the
and Homer dressed in his long white laboratory coat
looking every inch the doctor delivers his best
of Larchs popular blessing
HOMER
Good night you Princes of Maine
You Kings of New England

On Copperfield and Steerforth and Curly as the door to

hall is closed and semi-darkness prevails in the room
Copperfield smiling shuts his eyes After a second
the
wide-eyed Steerforth shuts his eyes too Then Curly

The last to close his eyes is Buster

FADE TO
BLACK

THE END
