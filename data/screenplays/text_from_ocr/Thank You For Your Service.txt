“RUSTAMIYAH IRAQ APRIL 28 2007”

OVER BLACK the WHISTLE of an incoming round followed by the
PULPY CRUNCH of a 762 entering a man’s skull A BESTIAL
GRUNT escapes him and the man falls with a THUD Suddenly
DEAFENING GUNFIRE BANGS in the darkness VOICES SHOUT ORDERS
all around us Beneath the chaos A FALLEN MAN GROANS--

INT STAIRS - BUILDING 20 - RUSTAMIYAH IRAQ - DAY

Light explodes onto the upper left-corner of the frame A
door to sunlight A silhouetted soldier staggers through it
carrying the wounded soldier on his back They descend a
cement staircase one agonizing step at a time as it winds
around and around A bloody trail splattered behind them--

ADAM SCHUMANN is breathless his hazel eyes bursting with
exertion His blouse covered in blood Every cell in his body
screaming folding under the weight of his friend

ADAM
--hang on Emory

MICHAEL EMORY is the 2301b Arkansas whiteboy draped across
his shoulders The gunshot wound has split his skull and he
hemorrhages blood thick with brain-matter His left arm
swings lifelessly across Adam’s front crimson blood
dribbling across an AMERICAN EAGLE tattoo on his forearm

EMORY
--hurts

His blood pulses down Adam’s head and neck soaking his
front creeping across his mouth Adam purses his lips and
cranes his neck to keep it out A sunlit doorway below--
Last flight of stairs His legs shaking violently Emory is
slipping off his back Adam tries to yank him back into
place In doing so he inhales sharply and sucks down a glob
of blood He chokes on it choking on his friend
Adam slips He falls He drops Emory

covering angles GUNFIRE from the street is met with gunfire
from the rooftop above them They crouch there--

CLOSE ON ADAM veins pulsing in his neck cracked lips and
salty gear The eyes of his men are all looking to him

ADAM
Two more floors Move--

Moving again Tension building on their quickening breath
The stairs climb past a landing covered with the ash of books
and a pyre of desk-chairs Step by step the GUNFIRE CLOSER

He signals them to stop Last flight of stairs above-- a door
there leads to the rooftop Light seeps around its frame
GUNFIRE BANGS outside it Our boys share a ready-look

EMORY
Stairway to heaven

The moment stretches into silence The gunfire has stopped
Adam flashes a countdown with his hand and they bang outside--

EXT ROOFTOP - BUILDING 20 - DAY

Sunlight blinds us their shadows fanning out across the
flare into light so bright they seem to float over the city

EMORY on his back head split brains bulging

ADAM (CONTD)
Hold on Emory I got you

EMORY
My head--

Adam backlit by sun crouches to lift him Emory’s helmet
still wobbles there brain bits rolling around inside

INT STAIRWAY - BUILDING 20 - DAY

Light explodes onto the upper left-corner of the frame Adam
staggers through it carrying Emory on his back They descend
a cement staircase one agonizing step at a time as it winds
around and around A bloody trail splattered behind them--

Adam is breathless his hazel eyes bursting with exertion
His blouse covered in blood Every cell in his body
screaming folding under the weight of his friend

ADAM
--hang on Emory

Emory hemorrhages blood thick with brain-matter It pulses
down Adam’s head and neck creeping across his mouth He
purses his lips and cranes his neck to keep it out

A sunlit doorway below Last flight of stairs His legs are
shaking violently Emory slipping off his back Adam tries to
yank him into place and inhales sharply-- he sucks down a
glob of blood and chokes on it Adam slips He falls He
drops Emory and watches him tumble down the steps

His head clips the stairs with a thud and Emory’s lifeless
body lays knotted below eyes staring vacantly up at Adam

JAMES DOSTER

up to something don’t You changed
the route It was another engagement-

The fun behind them escalates into a brawl Adam’s knee is
pumping hookah rattling on table

JAMES DOSTER (CONTD)

ADAM
My instincts were wrong

( )

JAMES DOSTER
