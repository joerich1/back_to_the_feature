filled
with overstuffed hefty bags
A weathered FORD ESCORT pulls into the empty PARKING LOT and
comes to
a stop near the athletic field
A TEENAGE GIRLS VOICE -
TRACY (VO)
None of this would have happened if Mr
McAllister hadnt meddled the way he
did He should have just accepted
things as they are instead of trying to
interfere with destiny You see you
cant interfere with destiny Thats
why its destiny And if you try to
interfere the same things going to
happen anyway and youll just suffer
JIM MCALLISTER a teacher in his mid to late-thirties emerges
from

picks up
some litter tosses it in a nearby garbage can

meetings and shared an interest in 60s
music and micro-breweries

CLOSE ON DAVE really getting into it playing to an unseen
stadium
Behind him JIM is very careful with his chords

JIM (VO CONTD)
You could tell Dave was one of those
guys who taught because they never
wanted to leave high school in the first
place and that could get a little
irritating sometimes but basically he
was a real good guy

was strictly professional between us --
I mean nothing

Paul I know youve been pretty down
since your accident

PAUL
wanted to play next year so bad I
could taste it And maybe go on to

JIM
know I understand disappointment
really do
PAUL
Yeah
JIM

But youve got a big choice right now
You can choose to be depressed about it
for the rest of your life Or you can
choose to see it for what it really is
an opportunity I personally think you
have a big future ahead of you and I
dont mean the fleeting glory of sports

PAUL
What do you mean
JIM
Let me give you a clue Youre a born
leader Youre one of the most popular
students at Millard Youre honest and
straightforward You dont choke under
pressure as we all saw in that amazing
fourth quarter against Westside The
other kids look up to you What does
that spell

Paul furrows his brow and looks around searching for an
answer His
lower lip is wet

JIM
Student council president

It takes a moment for this to sink in Finally

PAUL
Who me Nooo I never I dont
know anything about that stuff Mr M
Besides thats Tracy Flicks thing
Shes always working so hard and --

JIM
Yeah no shes a go-getter all right

PAUL
And shes super-nice

Yeah But one person assured of
victory kind of undermines the whole
idea of a democracy doesnt it Thats

dictatorship like we studied

Paul whats your favorite fruit

PAUL
Huh Oh Uh pears

JIM
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of
the blackboard

JIM
Okay lets say
PAUL
No wait -- apples Apples

JIM
Fine Lets say all you ever knew was
apples Apples apples and more apples
You might think apples were pretty good
even if you occasionally got a rotten
one Then one day theres an orange And
now you can make a decision Do you want
an apple or do you want an orange
Thats democracy

its time to give a little something
back

INT MILLARD GYMNASIUM DAY
The entire student body is assembled on the bleachers There is
palpable mood of boredom and apathy

JERRY SLAVIN a handicapped kid in a wheelchair is at the

microphone His head lists to one side and he takes long
breaths as

he speaks

JERRY
I love Millard High and I will be a
dedicated vice President A vote for
Jerry Slavin is a vote for good
government And even if I cant really
stand up for you I will

(cracks himself up)
Thank you

Jerry motors away amid scattered applause and coughs JIM
steps
forward clapping and raises the mike

JIM
Thank you Jerry and good luck Again
Jerry is running unopposed for Vice
President So well move on now to the
presidential race with three candidates
running The first in alphabetical order
is Tracy Flick
Tracy steps forward with a small stack of index cards During
her

speech she flips the cards over one by one but rarely looks at
them

TRACY
Poet Henry David Thoreau once wrote I
cannot make my days longer so I strive
to make them better With this
election we here at Millard also have
an opportunity to make our high school
days better During this campaign I
have had the opportunity to speak with
many of you about your concerns I
spoke with freshman Eliza Ramirez who
told me how alienated she feels from her
own homeroom I spoke with sophomore
Reggie Banks who said his mother works
in a cafeteria and cant afford to buy
him enough spiral notebooks for his
classes I wont bore you with long-
winded promises about all the new and
innovative things I will definitely
achieve during the year in which it will
be my honor and privilege to represent
each and every one of you but I can say
that my years of experience on the
student council have taught me the three
most important attributes the president
needs to possess commitment -

DOUG SCHENKEN
Eat me

DOUGS BUDDY
Eat me raw

There is scattered laughter Tracy pauses wait Hendricks
bounds up
and grabs the mike

WALT
If you cant be adults and give these
candidates the courtesy they deserve
then you dont deserve to be called
adults but children Because thats what
children are And youll be treated like
children So lets all listen up

Walt backs away to his seat Tracy resumes
TRACY
The three most important attributes the
president needs to possess are
commitment qualifications and
experience Ill add one more caring
I care about Millard and I care about
each and every one of you and together
we can all make a difference One of
the things I would like to establish is
a regular open forum where any student
can come and voice their concern about
issues we face here at Millard I and
the rest of the student council would
then interface with the faculty and
staff so a continuous dialogue would
exist

Walt whispers to Jim

WALT
Id say she knows a thing or two about
student-faculty dialogue

JIM nods solemnly

TRACY
When you cast your vote for Tracy Flick
next week you wont just be voting for
me Youll be voting for yourself and
for every other student Our days wont
be any longer but they can sure be
better Thank you

Tracy smiles and walks back to her folding chair There is
polite

applause and a few whistles JJJB comes back to the
microphone

Tracy takes her seat next to Paul and glances at him Paul
scares

straight ahead a fat bead of sweat on his forehead One of his
legs

is jiggling

JIM
The next candidate for student body
president is Paul Metzier Paul

Paul awkwardly makes his way to the mike Though by no means
thunderous his applause clearly exceeds Tracys A small
cluster of
jocks woof for him shaking their fists in the air Paul
manages a
weak grin for his buddies

Tracy shifts in her chair her smile stiff and forced

Lisa smiles and nods at Paul from the bleachers giving him

encouragement and a silent reminder to remember what they
talked

about

Tammys eyes dart between Lisa and Paul She shows no emotion
reveals
nothing

The applause quickly dies and after a moment Paul remembers to
look

at the white paper in his hand He speaks in a barely audible

monotone never once glancing up

PAUL
As many of you know I broke my leg
pretty bad thi3 year and the experience
has made me reevaluate what I want to do
with my life and that is help people
when you think about it a school is more
than a school its our second home where
we spend all cur time and grow as
individuals and a community but is our
school everything it could be I want our
school to reach its true potential that
is why I am running for president

JIM pinches the bridge of his nose clearly pained

A few loud SOUND EFFECT SNORES saw through the air and Walt
points a
stern finger at - you guessed it -- Doug Schenken

PAUL
I know what it is to fight hard and win
like when we almost went to state last
fall and I threw that fourth-quarter
pass against Westside for the touchdown
that won the game by three points I
wont let you down like I didnt then I
promise we can all score a winning

(big breath)
touchdown together Vote Paul Metzier
for president thank you
Paul now gets considerably less applause but his jock friends

remain
loyal
JIM
Okay Paul Now our final candidate for
President - another one of the Metzier
clan -- sophomore Tammy Metzier
Tammy approaches the mike There are scattered mocking whistles
and

catcalls

Tammy calmly looks over the crowd waiting for the jeers to
subside
She makes eye contact with Lisa who stares back

WALT
People People I

The room quiets down Tammy puts her lips close to the mike

TAMMY
Who cares about this stupid election

NOW theres something worth listening to

TAMMY (CONTD)
We all know it doesnt matter who gets
elected president of Millard You think
its going to change anything around
here make one single person happier or
smarter or nicer The only person it
matters to is the one who gets elected
The same pathetic charade happens every
year and everyone makes the same
pathetic promises just so they can put
it on their transcripts to get into
college So vote for me because I
dont even want to go to college and I
dont care and as president I wont do
anything The only promise I make is
that if elected I will immediately
dismantle the student government so
that none of us will ever have to sit
through one of these stupid assemblies
again

There is a sudden huge cathartic eruption of cheers and
applause

Tammy has set them free Even cynical old Doug Schenken and
his
buddies join in

STUDENTS
Tammy Tammy Tammy

In total control she steps back from the mike and CURTSIES

Walt shoots an angry confused look at Jim who shrugs Tracy

is
clearly upset but her smile remains eerily fixed Paul just
looks
confused and ashamed Jerry Slavin is convulsed in laughter
and
chants along with the multitude
Tammy quickly grabs the mike for one final exhortation
TAMMY
Oh dont vote for me I Who cares
Dont vote at all

displays a DIGITIZED PHOTO of the Millard yearbook staff DAVE

CURSOR

in the shape of tiny SCISSORS makes a small circle around
Daves face

Suddenly the cursor turns into a tiny HAND and drags Daves
dislodged

head into the TRASH

Tracy concentrates as she deftly controls the mouse

When arrived at school that morning

I was shocked to find that one of my key
banners had been removed by vandals I
noticed that a few of my rivals posters
had also been tampered with Of course

INT LITTLE CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

Tracy is seated in a chair JIM hovers above her alternately
leaning
on a desk and pacing

JIM
I guess you know why youre here

TRACY
If its about the posters I think its
so awful Its a travesty

JIM
A travesty Huh Thats interesting
because I think you did it

TRACY
Wait - are you accusing me Youre not
serious

(indignant)
I cant Mr McAllister we have
worked together on SGA for three solid
years and I mean I cant believe it
Im Im shocked

JIM stares at her

TRACY (CONTD)
Mr M I am running on my
qualifications I would never need to
resort to you know to vandalism like
a you know Plus my own best banner
was torn down Did I do that too

JIM
Were you or were you not working in the
Watchdog office over the weekend

TRACY
I was So Mr Pecharda let me in
As you know with all my
responsibilities I often come in on the
weekend and have permission to do so
But I left very early around 630
JIM
630 How do you know what time the
posters were torn down

TRACY
I dont I just know they were there
when I left Im giving you helpful
information is all You know instead
of wasting time interrogating me we
should be out there trying to find out
who did this

JIM
Okay Tracy so who do you think did
it Whom should we interrogate

TRACY
well I dont know It could have been
anybody There are a lot of you know
subversive elements around Millard You
know like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck
and those burn-outs Or Doug Schenken -
what about him Or what about Tammy
Metzier Her whole thing is being anti-
this and anti-that

JIM shifts gears

JIM
Youre a very intelligent girl Tracy
You have many admirable qualities But
someday maybe youll learn that being
smart and always being on top and doing
whatever you need to do to get ahead
and yes stepping on people to get
there well theres a lot more to life
than that And in the end youre only
cheating yourself

TRACY
Why are you lecturing me

JIM

This isnt the time or the place to get
into it but there is for just one
example a certain former colleague of
mine who made a very big mistake a
life mistake I think the lesson there
is that old and young we ail make
mistakes and we have to learn that our
actions all of them can carry serious

consequences Youre very young Tracy
underage in fact -- but maybe one
day youll understand

TRACY
I dont know what youre referring to
but I do know that if certain older and
wiser people hadnt acted like such
little babies and gotten all mushy
everything would be okay

JIM
I agree But I also think certain
young and naive people need to thank
their lucky stars and be very very
grateful the whole school didnt find
out about certain indiscretions which
could have ruined their reputations and
chances to win certain elections

TRACY
And I think certain older persons like
you and your colleague shouldnt be
leaching after their students
especially when some of them cant even
get their own wives pregnant And they
certainly shouldnt be running around
making slanderous accusations
Especially when certain young naive
peoples mothers are para-legal
secretaries at the citys biggest law
firm and have won many successful
lawsuits And if you want to keep
questioning me like this I wont
continue without my attorney present

JIM draws a long breath as he tries to control himself

JIM

entire life in question I somehow
discovered within myself a place of
perfect peace Oddly in my solitude I
felt more than ever a sense of communion
with every human being - past present

tell ourselves no matter what illusions
of friendship and family we create each
of us is always and forever profoundly
alone

We move closer to Jim in SLOW-MOTION What actually occurs in
split-second is suspended in time

JIM (VO CONTD)
he sight of Tracy at that moment
ffected me in a way I cant fully
xplain Part of it was that she was
pying but mostly it was her face
ooking at her you might think she was
sweet innocent teenage girl But she
asnt sweet And she wasnt innocent
he was selfish and cynical and
mbitious and thought nothing of
estroying the lives of others to get to

climb in life how many people would

suffer because of her I had to stop her
now
