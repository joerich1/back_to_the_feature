FADE IN
EXT DARK FOREST - NIGHT

FLAMES fill the SCREEN Then the gentle voice of an
OLD WOMAN barely more than a whisper

OLD WOMAN (V0O)

I am a common woman I was born

in a common cottage in a common
village My life would likely be
no different from yours were it
not for the most uncommon events
that occurred during the winter of
the Year of Our Lord Thirteen
Hundred and Twenty-five I

learned many things that winter
About people About love But
mainly I learned about loss

A MAN tosses a piece of wood into the flames which turns
out to be a LARGE CAMPFIRE

OLD WOMAN (V0O)

To this day I am the only person

that I know to be living who knows

the whole truth about that

horrible time This is my tale

CAMERA PULLS BACK revealing THREE KNIGHTS beleaguered
scarred returning from the Crusades Their armor is in
disarray adorned with souvenirs from the Middle East
Theyre camped in a clearing their cart pulled toa
nearby roadside LIGHTNING flashes in the distance

One of them a TEENAGE BOY who looks like his sword might
weigh more than he does hitches a nervous HORSE to a
tree He strokes the horses neck calming

Then A WOLF HOWLS in the distance The Boy suddenly
looks nervous too He quickly joins the others at the
campfire -- a FAT KNIGHT (30s) and an OLD KNIGHT

TEENAGE BOY
Did you hear that

FAT KNIGHT
Hear what
The wolf HOWLS AGAIN The Boy shivers fearful

TEENAGE BOY
The innkeeper told me --

FAT KNIGHT
I know what he told you He told
you about the Wolf The Beast of
Villiers la CroisAOe
(off Boys look)
The people of that village have
been spreading that nonsense since
before you were a tickle in your
daddys prick Id give you a
whipping for believing it if I
thought it would do any good
The Old Knight stares into the fire then speaks

OLD KNIGHT
used to travel these woods
hey told the same stories then
hat they do now Only I heard
hem from a man who actually saw
he beast with his own eyes

aha aH

FAT KNIGHT
Half the people in these parts
claim to have seen it

OLD KNIGHT
This man claimed it was the last
thing he ever saw The Wolf took
his eyes And half his face
(off their looks)
I saw his scars and empty eye
sockets His skin looked like it
was on inside-out It didnt seem
to me like the kind of thing a man
would make up a story about
He shrugs His companions exchange an unnerved look

EXT DARK FOREST - NIGHT (LATER)

ts raining now The Knights sleep underneath the cart
for shelter Lightning FLASHES

Then from 0S the horse gives a series of frightened
NEIGHS The Boy stirs but by the time he awakens there
is only the sound of the RAIN Did he imagine it He
reluctantly decides to venture out to investigate

The Boy hurries over to where he tied the horse but
all he finds is the empty rope blowing in the wind Ina
FLASH of lightning he sees that the horse is gone

Then he hears something A strange GNAWING sound
TEARING and POPPING He slowly turns

Not far away he makes out a shape in the darkness The
horse is on its side WHEEZING helplessly And theres
something crouched next to it We cant make out what it
is only a MAN-LIKE SHAPE shrouded in shadow
Whatever it is its eating the horse alive
The Boy steps away in horror then hurriedly stumbles
back to his companions and frantically shakes them awake

FAT KNIGHT
What the devil are you --
TEENAGE BOY
Wait wait Be quiet
He raises a hand Hes heard something They listen
FOOTSTEPS Approaching through the mud The Boys hand
clutches a dagger but the Fat Knight reaches out and
stays him terrified The Boy follows his look
We never get a good look at THE FIGURE walking toward
them But what the men see scares them shitless It
stops near the cart The men huddle together watching
as it slowly starts to walk around the cart --
-- then suddenly jumps atop it The Figure is now above
them With each step it takes the boards of the wooden
cart CREAK and bend under its weight A long beat
Then the Figure jumps down again landing behind the men
startling them It pauses The men cower shivering
Suddenly the cart is flipped over as if it weighed
nothing revealing the terrified Knights beneath it
Lightning FLASHES A shadow falls over them
The men scramble to their feet but the Old Knight slips
in the mud The Boy stops to help him but then the Old
Knight starts screaming something GROWLS and the Boy
stops short at what he sees The Fat Knight runs

TEENAGE BOY
Wait We have to help him
The Fat Knight ignores him The Old Knight shrieks We
hear the same TEARING and POPPING that this thing made
while eating the horse The Boy quickly looks around

sees a curved Arabian scimitar lying in the mud

fallen from the overturned wagon He grabs it and as the
Fat Knight runs the Boy stands his ground He hefts the
blade Hes young but he has used this before A lot
Rain beats down on his face and lightning FLASHES as he
confronts the thing that is devouring the Old Knight

The Fat Knight runs through the forest without looking
back He hears a loud HOWL behind him and runs faster
Then he hears the Boy SCREAMING and blind panic sets in
his head filled with the sounds of his HEAVY BREATHING
and RUNNING FOOTFALLS in the mud and crashing THUNDER
Hes running so fast he nearly falls into the RUSHING
RIVER that crosses his path He quickly looks for a way
to cross The river is gorged and the water is moving
fast Then in a flash of lightning he spots it --
A fallen tree spans the river The Knight hurries to it
The bark is smooth and slick from the rain He cant
stand on it He has to crawl He edges out on his hands
and knees his eyes flicking nervously at the waters
surging underneath him He has almost made it across
when he hears a LOW SNARL He freezes Looks bac
Lightning FLASHES The Figure still obscured to us
stands on the riverbank behind the Knight It GROWLS
The Knight tries to crawl away but slips and nearly
falls in the river Then suddenly the tree beneath him
begins to move He hangs on for his life and looks back
The Figure is on the tree behind him slowly closing in
He starts to crawl slips again No way he can get away
He looks down into the racing river waters Then back at
the Figure closing in The choice is clear The Fat
night dives headfirst off the tree --
-- but he never hits the water Something grabs him by
the legs and stops him short He cries out and looks up
at the thing that is dangling him helplessly above the
water He weeps Then abruptly --
-- he is yanked up out of sight

EXT VILLAGE - DAY

A BUTCHER quickly and expertly cuts the throat of a pig
that has been hung upside down by its hind legs It
kicks and squirms as it bleeds out into a pan
VILLAGERS bustle along a muddy road A MERCHANT sells
his wares Dogs run and BARK A DISHEVELLED MAN locked
up in the stockade A BLACKSMITHs hammer CLANGS

On the surface a typical medieval village But
something is wrong here A pall hangs over the place
The people are subdued beaten A TITLE comes up

FRANCE

Theres a SIGN in the village green Hanging from it is
a wood plank with a crude drawing of a moon on it three-
quarters full The moon has a vaguely sinister face

INT ISABELLES FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - DAY

A tiny spider spins its web CAMERA RACKS FOCUS to a
pretty 17-year-old GIRL gazing up at it Her name is
ISABELLE She scoops the spider up watches it crawl
around on her hand fascinated

EXT ISABELLES FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY

The home of a medieval peasant Isabelles mother
SUZETTE (late 30s) and sister LUCIE (18 plain-
looking) work in the garden They look up as Isabelle
emerges from the cottage daintily carrying the spider

LUCIE
Honestly Isabelle Just kill it

ISABELLE
I cant Its the fifth
commandment Thou shalt not kill
Lucie rolls her eyes Isabelle crouches letting the
spider crawl off her hand She watches it skitter away
then calls to Suzette feigning nonchalance

ISABELLE
Im going to take Father some
water

SUZETTE

All right Dont be long
Isabelle smiles grabs a bucket and ladle and anxiously
heads toward the village Lucie watches her go dubious

EXT VILLAGE - DAY

Isabelle struggles to draw water from a well Even
toiling and sweaty Isabelles beauty stands in stark
contrast to her squalid surroundings

A CARPENTER building a timber-framed structure notices
his TWO YOUNG APPRENTICES (late teens) casting distracted
glances in her direction He calls out to her smiling

CARPENTER
Hey there Let one of these
young lads get that for you

ISABELLE
can do it myself
The Carpenter smiles Of course she can

fq

EXT NEW FIELD - DAY
The village WOODCUTTERS are chopping down trees and
hauling away the lumber A GROUP of them are in the
midst of what looks like a serious conversation
sabelle approaches them with the bucket of water One
of them turns and sees Isabelle His name is CESAIRE
(handsome 40s) He hides his dour expression and gives
sabelle a big smile She smiles back

ISABELLE
Mother thought you might be
thirsty

CESATIRE

That was very thoughtful of her

He gives her a knowing look as he ladles a drink from the
bucket Isabelles gaze drifts from him to another
woodcutter working off by himself His name is PETER
(21 darkly handsome almost dangerous-looking)

He makes eye contact with Isabelle for a moment then
wipes his brow and calls out to the WOODCUTTER BOSS

PETER
Im taking a break

WOODCUTTER BOSS

A break Does that mean youre

going to start working

The other Woodcutters LAUGH Peter walks away
Isabelles gaze lingers on him too long Cesaire
notices not entirely comfortable with what he sees

EXT WOODS - PATH - DAY

Not far from where the Woodcutters work Peter waits
impatient Soon Isabelle approaches smiling He takes
her in his arms kissing her She holds him tight

PETER
I was afraid you werent coming

ISABELLE
You should know better than that

He kisses her again nibbling her neck Isabelle opens
her eyes smiles up at him Touches his face

ISABELLE
I think my sisters starting to
suspect something

PETER
Do you think shell tell your
father

ISABELLE

I dont care I wish she would
tell him I want everyone to
know Besides my father likes
you

PETER
Of course he does Right up until
the point where he figures out
what Im doing with his daughter
Peter glances back and Isabelle follows his look
Through the trees she sees her father and the group of
grim Woodcutters still in serious conversation

ISABELLE
Whats going on

PETER
You havent heard
(off her look)
Three men They found them this
morning just off the Center Road
At least they think it was three
men There wasnt enough left to
piece them back together
A long beat as Isabelle takes this in Then

ISABELLE
Was it the Wolf

PETER
Could it have been anything else
Isabelle shudders No it couldnt have been

PETER
We should have killed that monster
a long time ago

ISABELLE
I know You say that every month

He gives her a grim smile then kisses her She kisses
him back then tries to stop kissing him Its not easy

ISABELLE
Id better go

PETER
Same time tomorrow

ISABELLE
Dont get used to this I start
my sewing lessons next week
PETER
You really think you can go all
day without seeing me

ISABELLE
Ill manage somehow Pride is a
cardinal sin by the way

PETER
I can think of worse sins I could
be committing
She gives a cautioning look then leaves with a smile

EXT VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAWN

The VILLAGE HERALD is changing the plank on the moon
sign He replaces the picture of the three-quarters moon
with a picture of a half moon its face indifferent

HERALD
Half full Half full

INT ISABELLES FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAWN

Suzette is putting bread and cheese into a basket
Isabelle pulls on a drab hooded cloak

SUZETTE
You mind your grandmother

now the same as the other girls

ISABELLE
Yes Mother
Suzette hands her the basket with a proud look

SUZETTE
My last baby has grown up

EXT VILLAGE - CROSSROADS - MORNING

Isabelle watches a DEAF BOY perform simple sleight of
hand magic tricks His name is CLAUDE She
applauds his performance and hands him a coin He makes
it oedisappear then smiles big and runs away

A crazy old woman LUCRECE shoots Isabelle a look

LUCRECE
Youre only encouraging him

ISABELLE
I know
THREE GIRLS (ages 16-18) approach ROXANNE (round-faced
cheery and instantly likable) PRUDENCE (practical
serious) and ROSEMARIA (pretty arrogant flirtatious)
A playful PUPPY tags along Prudence and Rosemaria look
tired but Roxanne greets Isabelle with a big smile

ISABELLE
You look happy

ROXANNE
Arent you excited

PRUDENCE
Its too early to be excited

ROXANNE
Im just trying to look on the
bright side

ROSEMARIA
Well stop it before somebody
hurts you
The girls have a laugh at Roxannes expense

EXT VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - MORNING

The girls leave the village on a trail that leads through
the dark forest The puppy stops at the edge of the
forest Then it WHINES and refuses to follow

EXT DARK FOREST - PATH - MORNING

The trail stretches out in front of the girls as far as
they can see Rosemaria walks with Roxanne Prudence

hangs back with Isabelle brimming with juicy gossip

PRUDENCE
Did you hear about her and the
Darley brothers

ISABELLE
Oh no Which one

PRUDENCE
Both On the same night
Isabelle gives an incredulous look and Prudence tries to
contain her laughter Rosemaria hears and looks back at
them She scowls at Isabelle

ROSEMARIA
Why does your grandmother have to
live so far away

ISABELLE
Whats the matter Rosemaria
Having trouble walking
Prudence laughs Roxanne frowns disapproving
Rosemaria shoots Isabelle a dirty look

EXT GRANDMOTHERS COTTAGE - DAY

The girls cross a little wooden bridge that spans a
BABBLING brook and follow the trail to a large cottage
well past its prime Chickens CLUCK and peck around it
An OLD WOMAN opens the door and waves to them Shes
stooped and withered but her eyes are bright and
beautiful She wears a blue belted gown and a necklace
with a crucifix on it This is Isabelles GRANDMOTHER

GRANDMOTHER
Well stop dawdling Come on
come on
The girls hurry inside but Grandmother stops Isabelle

GRANDMOTHER
Your mother has warned you not to
expect any special treatment from
me

ISABELLE
Yes maam
Grandmother eyes her a moment longer then breaks into a
smile and surreptitiously hands her a bright red apple

GRANDMOTHER
Well then your mother doesnt
know me very well does she
Isabelle smiles as Grandmother ushers her inside

INT GRANDMOTHERS COTTAGE - DAY

Grandmother works a pair of knitting needles casting
loops of red wool yarn onto one of them a BLACK CAT
resting on her lap Her bedchamber is hidden by a
beautiful veil embroidered with palms and pomegranates
The girls sit facing her watching as she knits Then

GRANDMOTHER
There This is going to be my
foundation Everything I do now
will build off of this
She shows the row of stitches to Roxanne

GRANDMOTHER
Roxanne is this a good
foundation

ROXANNE
I dont know

GRANDMOTHER
Why not

ROXANNE
Well you havent told us what

youre making

GRANDMOTHER
Theres something else I havent
told you I havent told you why
Im making it Before you begin
any task you must first always
ask yourself why

ROSEMARIA
Why
The girls laugh Grandmother gives her a patient smile

GRANDMOTHER
Because understanding why you are
doing something is the key to
doing it successfully So before
we begin today lets be certain
that we have a good foundation
Who can tell me why you are here

PRUDENCE
To become seamstresses To learn
how to sew and mend clothes

GRANDMOTHER
Thats what you are doing But
why are you doing it
Blank looks None of them have ever considered this

GRANDMOTHER
Isabelle your sister studied with
me last winter What does she do
now

ISABELLE
She works with the women

GRANDMOTHER
Why dont you work with them
ISABELLE
I dont know how to yet

GRANDMOTHER
And how does that make you feel
Isabelle thinks for a moment then has an insight

ISABELLE
Like a child
Grandmother gives her a smile then continues

GRANDMOTHER
You will be coming here every day
for the next three months During
that time I will teach you
everything you need to know to be
productive members of our
community But there is something
far more important that will also
be happening here
All the girls are paying close attention now but
Grandmother seems to be speaking directly to Isabelle

GRANDMOTHER
You will be proving your worth and
learning your place in the world
And I promise you when you leave
here for the last time you will
never feel like a child again

EXT VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - DUSK

The four girls return to the village along the forest
path Waiting for them is Peter Isabelle pretends to
not notice him As they pass he calls out to her

PETER
I need to talk to you
Isabelle turns to face him trying to stay nonchalant

ISABELLE
What about
Peter just looks at her for a beat Isabelle turns and
sees that the other girls have stopped to watch
Isabelle shoots them a look The girls take the hint and
leave When theyve gone Peter walks up to Isabelle

PETER
When were you planning on telling
me

ISABELLE

Telling you what

PETER
That youre engaged to be married
to Henri Smith
Isabelle gapes at him stunned and confused

ISABELLE
Henri Smith Is this a joke

PETER
Look at me Just look at me and
tell me you didnt know
She looks at him and sees it in his eyes Hes serious

ISABELLE
Who told you this

PETER
Your father
Off Isabelles look
INT ISABELLES FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - NIGHT

The family is gathered around the table Isabelle and
Lucie listen to their parents in stunned silence

SUZETTE
Its all been arranged Your

marriage to Henri will settle our

debt to his father

Isabelle nods shaken Cesaire sees that shes upset

SUZETTE
We know that you and Peter have
become friends But you have
adult responsibilities now That
means putting your familys
interests ahead of your own

ISABELLE
So Henri Smith is in the familys
interest and Peter is not

CESAIRE
Peter is a fine young man

ISABELLE
But what Hes poor Hes an
orphan

SUZETTE

Hes not one of us His parents
were outsiders

ISABELLE
Why Because they hadnt lived
here since Noah built the ark

SUZETTE
You mind your tongue
Isabelle is about to respond when she notices something
Lucie is crying A beat Lucie looks up at her parents

LUCIE
Do you realize how this makes me
look Im older than her by more
than a year If anyone should be
getting married in the spring
its me
Everyone is taken aback Lucie storms out of the
cottage angrily wiping tears Isabelle watches her go

INT ISABELLES FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - NIGHT
Cesaire smokes his pipe troubled Suzette sits nearby

CESAIRE
This was your idea Now I have
both of them hating me
In the loft Isabelle and Lucie are in bed but
Isabelle only pretends to be asleep so she can eavesdrop

SUZETTE
We knew Isabelle was going to be
stubborn It wouldnt be like her
to simply do as shes told Shes
too much like her grandmother

CESATIRE
That she is What about Lucie

SUZETTE
Shes a good girl but shes still
a child Talk to her Youre her
father Shell listen to you
Isabelle glances over at Lucie and sees that shes
been eavesdropping too Lucie turns away embarrassed
Isabelle gives her a sad look

EXT ISABELLES FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY

Theres a knock at the door Isabelle answers revealing
HENRI Hes tall and good-looking but still
awkward in his body Isabelle eyes him a little aloof

HENRI
Hello Isabelle

ISABELLE
Hello Henri

EXT VILLAGE - ROAD - DAY
Isabelle and Henri walk in awkward silence Then

HENRI
So I suppose youve heard
ISABELLE
Yes My parents are very pleased

HENRI
And you Are you pleased

ISABELLE
Its a very generous arrangement

Not the answer he was hoping for Another awkward beat

HENRI
Do you have any other feelings
about it About me

ISABELLE
Im not sure Weve never really
talked that much

HENRI
I know Thats why I asked you to
walk with me I wanted to talk

ISABELLE
What for
HENRI
Well because were going to be

husband and wife soon

ISABELLE
Not until the spring festival
Thats months away A lot can
happen in a few months
Henri seems disappointed She sees this and reconsiders

ISABELLE
All right What would you like to
talk about

HENRI
Im not really sure I brought
you this
He reaches into his pocket and offers Isabelle a flower
She takes it suddenly blushing But just then she sees
Peter walking toward them with another WOODCUTTER

ISABELLE
Well Im glad we had this
conversation
Isabelle abruptly turns and walks away leaving Henri
surprised and a little hurt She passes Peter her eyes
averted He glances back at her as she and walks away

INT ISABELLES FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

Isabelle is helping Suzette prepare dinner but shes
purposefully ignoring her mother Suzette notices

SUZETTE
You know I had a sweetheart when
I was your age too
Isabelle looks up intrigued in spite of herself
Suzette smiles slyly at her reaction

ISABELLE
What happened

SUZETTE
Nothing happened My parents
arranged for me to marry your
father and that was the end of
that

ISABELLE
Didnt you want to marry your
sweetheart

SUZETTE
Of course I did But theres
more to marriage than being in
love Love doesnt always last
and it certainly doesnt fill your
childrens bellies in the winter

ISABELLE
Youve never wished you could have
married that other boy

SUZETTE
Not even once
Isabelle eyes her still uncertain

INT CHURCH - DAY

Isabelle prays in front of an altar with prayer candles
on it Peter kneels next to her and lights one of them

PETER
We need to talk

EXT CHURCH - DAY

Isabelle and Peter stand behind the church out of sight
Peter looks off toward the woods his back to Isabelle

PETER
You have to go through with it
You have to marry Henri

Isabelle takes a step toward him She hesitates
gathering her nerve to speak Then

ISABELLE
I dont care what my parents want
They dont own me I love you

PETER
That doesnt matter

ISABELLE
t does to me Doesnt it matter
to you

PETER

ISABELLE
You sound like my mother

PETER
Then maybe you should start
listening to your mother
(off her look)
Its over They had to find out
eventually Dont turn this into
something that its not We had
our fun but thats all it ever
was
Isabelle looks up at him shocked and confused

ISABELLE
I dont believe you

PETER
Go home Isabelle Go home and
grow up
Isabelle gapes at him Peter walks away

ISABELLE
I dont believe you
He doesnt look back She watches him go heartbroken

EXT CREEK - DAWN

Cesaire bathes in a cold stream The sun is just barely
rising rays of light shining through the trees He
smiles It looks like the start of a beautiful day

EXT VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAWN

The village is bustling with activity but theres a
palpable tension The picture on the moon sign is of a
three-quarters moon but then the Herald changes it to
a picture of a FULL MOON with a cruel malevolent face

HERALD
Full moon Full moon Full moon

INT ISABELLES FAMILY COTTAGE - MORNING

sabelle emerges from the cottage Roxanne Prudence
and Rosemaria are outside waiting on her They all start
toward the village but then Isabelle sees something
n the shadows next to the cottage Cesaire is giving
Lucie a stern lecture Lucie turns and sees Isabelle
Her face is ashen and there are tears in her eyes
sabelle starts toward them but Cesaire stops her

CESATIRE
This doesnt concern you
sabelle

ISABELLE

Yes Father
sabelle reluctantly turns and walks away The girls
follow her Roxanne gives Lucie a concerned look

EXT VILLAGE - MORNING

The girls walk through the village Isabelle is lost in
thought stung by her fathers brusk dismissal

ROXANNE
Whats wrong with Lucie

ROSEMARIA
How would you feel if you were in
love with your sisters fiancA©e
Isabelle stops short and gives Rosemaria a sharp look

ISABELLE
Lucie is not in love with my
fiancA©e

ROSEMARIA

Really So shes just had a crush
on him since she was ten

ISABELLE
As if she would really tell you
something like that

ROSEMARIA
She didnt She told my sister
(off Isabelles look)
Did you honestly not know
Isabelle clearly had no idea but tries to hide it Just
then they walk by the blacksmiths shop where Henri
works with his father ADRIEN Henri smiles at Isabelle

ISABELLE
Come on Were going to be late
She turns away Rosemaria gives her a smug look

EXT DARK FOREST - PATH - DAWN

The girls are walking down the path to Grandmothers
cottage Rosemaria lags behind tired and grumpy
Theres a fork in the path and Rosemaria stops at it A
SMALLER PATH branches off into the forest overgrown and
narrow Rosemaria looks at it for a beat

Roxanne suddenly notices that Rosemaria isnt with them
She looks back and sees her start down the other path

ROXANNE

Rosemaria

The other girls stop and hurry back to the fork dismayed
to find Rosemaria headed down the overgrown path

ISABELLE
What are you doing

ROSEMARIA
What does it look like

ISABELLE
You cant go that way You have
to stay on the path

ROSEMARIA
This way is faster

PRUDENCE
But its not safe My brother
says the bridge is rotten

ROSEMARIA
I dont care Its bad enough
working all day in that smelly
cottage Its not reasonable for
them to expect us to walk that far
every day on top of that
She walks away defiant The girls look nervous Then

PRUDENCE
f you get lost nobody will come
looking for you Not tonight
This last part gives Rosemaria pause She looks down the
narrow path It suddenly seems a little ominous
Grudgingly she returns to the group The other girls
exchange quiet looks of relief They continue on
The wind blows leaves across the abandoned path

INT GRANDMOTHERS COTTAGE - DAY

The girls are busy with sewing and knitting projects
Grandmother helps Roxanne at the spinning wheel Then

GRANDMOTHER
Everyone finish what youre
working on Your parents will be
worried if youre not home before
it starts to get dark
The girls begin packing up their work Prudence sighs
PRUDENCE
I wish someone would just kill
that stupid wolf

ROXANNE
You cant just kill it Its not
an ordinary wolf Its a devil-
wolf A servant of Satan himself
Prudence rolls her eyes Whatever

ROSEMARIA
Who cares what it is Its only
one night a month You stay
inside lock up the animals and
you dont go into the forest
Its never killed anyone from the
village and as long as we leave it
alone it never will

GRANDMOTHER
My goodness I had no idea our
young people were so woefully
uneducated these days
(off their looks)
Our village was not always like
this When I was young this was
a very special place Traders and
merchants came here from lands Id
never heard of selling things I
had never seen King Philip the
Bold even visited here once But
that of course was before the
Wolf came
The girls listen attentively

GRANDMOTHER
Your parents fear the Wolf because
they remember when it did kill
people from the village Break
down doors in the middle of the
night and snatch children right
out of their beds Rumors began

to spread that we were cursed
That was when our village began to
die And that was why my husband
led a group of men into the woods
to kill the Wolf But instead it
killed him

Isabelle reacts She has never heard this story before

GRANDMOTHER
After that people here didnt
have much stomach to go hunting
for it anymore But something had
changed The Wolf stopped killing
in the village Even our
livestock were usually safe as
long as they were brought inside
So we decided it was safer to
compromise We gave the Wolf its
one night a month the night of
the full moon and it has left us
alone ever since

ISABELLE
People still die

ROSEMARIA
Yes but nobody we know

GRANDMOTHER
Everyone knows what should be
done But its not always easy to
do what you know is right
Sometimes its easier to settle
for being safe
Isabelle frowns unsatisfied

EXT VILLAGE - VARIOUS - DAY

Villagers hurriedly bring their sheep and pigs into their
homes Doors are shut and barricaded Cesaire is
outside the family cottage nailing the shutters closed

INT ISABELLES FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DUSK

Isabelles family sits at the dinner table in silence
Cesaire sets mugs of beer out for everyone Lucie numbly
picks at her food doesnt touch her beer Isabelle
works up her nerve to say something and turns to Suzette

ISABELLE
You were right About Peter I
was being childish

(BEAT)
But Im not going to marry Henri
Cesaire and Suzette stop eating Suzette levels a cold
look at Isabelle

SUZETTE
Youll do as youre told Its
all been arranged

ISABELLE
The family gains the same no
matter which one of us marries
him And I dont love Henri
Lucie does
Lucie looks up surprised to be dragged into this

ISABELLE
Shes right Its not fair I
will gladly trade places with her
A beat Then without looking up Lucie whispers

LUCIE
Shut up
Isabelle is stung the smile wiped from her face

ISABELLE
Im sorry I

LUCIE
Please Just shut up and mind
your own business
A tense beat Isabelle looks away hurt and confused

INT ISABELLES FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - NIGHT

Isabelle is fast asleep Next to her Lucie looks over
at her Shes wide awake She sneaks out of bed

INT ISABELLES FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

Lucie carefully sneaks down from the loft and quietly
puts on a RED RIDING HOOD She accidently kicks a pan on
the floor and puts a hand down to silence it She
listens to hear if anyone has awakened Nothing

EXT VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

Lucie slips out of the house She shivers in the cold
pulls the riding hood around her FULL MOON in the sky
The village looks deserted a ghost town Eerie still
dark The moon-sign swings in the breeze CREAKING on
its rusty hooks Lucie hurries away toward the woods

EXT DARK FOREST - NIGHT

Lucie nervously walks along the road leading away from
the village She startles at every sound She looks up
The full moon is visible in the sky above her through the
skeletal branches of the dark trees

She comes to the overgrown path that the girls stopped at
earlier Lucie takes a deep breath and starts down it

EXT GULLY - NIGHT

Lucie reaches an OLD ROPE BRIDGE It spans a deep gully
and a fast-moving river strewn with jagged rocks Lucie
gives the bridge a nervous look and starts across it
The boards CREAK loudly under her feet The bridge sways
in the wind She carefully makes her way across only
breathing when she is safely on the other side

EXT WOODS - CLEARING - NIGHT

Lucie comes to a grassy meadow bathed with moonlight
She stands in the middle of it next to a large rock and
looks all around Shes alone cold and afraid Then
she takes off her riding hood folds it and places
it on the rock She begins to disrobe folding her dress
and her undergarments and stacking them in a neat pile
Soon shes standing naked her arms clutched around her
breasts shivering with cold And fear
CAMERA PULLS BACK from this lonely naked figure until the
dark branches of the trees obscure her from view Then
somewhere a WOLF HOWLS in the night

INT ISABELLES FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - DAWN
Isabelle wakes up groggy Lucies bed is empty
EXT DARK FOREST - DAY

Children are playing a BOY chasing several giggling
GIRLS growling and waving his hands like claws

BOY

EXT DARK FOREST - CLEARING - DAY

One of the Girls runs into the meadow and sees something
that makes her stop short The other Children gather
behind her all frozen by what they see

CROWS are picking at a bloody carcass All we can see of
it is a human hand A crow gnaws on one of the fingers

INT GRANDMOTHERS COTTAGE - DAY

The girls are at their lessons Suddenly theres an
urgent KNOCK at the door Everyone stops surprised
Grandmother answers it Its a YOUNG MAN sweaty and out
of breath from running
GRANDMOTHER
What on earth --
The Young Man glances at Isabelle Something about the
look in his eyes makes Isabelle go pale

EXT DARK FOREST - CLEARING - DAY

sabelle hurries into the clearing with Roxanne
Prudence and Rosemaria trailing behind her A crowd has
gathered She pushes through it then stop short

Lucie is dead We dont see whats been done to her but
Roxanne turns away and vomits Cesaire and Suzette are
already here He holds her as she cries on his shoulder
sabelle just stares at Lucies body shattered

INT ISABELLES FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

sabelle is curled in a fetal ball on the bed clutching
Lucies cloak to her chest Shes cried her eyes out
Grandmother sets down a cup of tea As Isabelle watches
Grandmother sprinkles a pinch of dark herbs in the tea

GRANDMOTHER
Its my little secret A pinch
will help you rest A little more
and youll sleep through the end
of the world
Grandmother smiles Isabelle smiles back weak

ISABELLE
I think Id like that

EXT VILLAGE - DAY
Two men the Merchant and the REEVE gossip by the well

MERCHANT
She had it coming if you ask me
What the hell was she doing out
there
Then they notice that Isabelle is right behind them
drawing a water from the well Both men shift
uncomfortably but she pretends she didnt hear

INT ISABELLES FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY

Lucies body lies on the table Isabelle watches as
Suzette and Grandmother bathe the body Suddenly
Grandmother stops Shes found something clutched in
Lucies hand A troubled look comes over her

ISABELLE
What is it

GRANDMOTHER
Nothing

Grandmother curtly wraps what shes found in a washcloth
INT CHURCH - DAY

Lucies funeral Cesaire and Suzette sit with Isabelle
who holds Grandmothers hand The other girls are here
too Roxanne sits with her mother MARGUERITE and
Claude the deaf boy we saw performing magic The
priest FATHER AUGUSTE conducts the service

FATHER AUGUSTE
Wherefore each man and woman that
is wise make him ready thereto
for we all shall die and we know
not how soon

EXT CHURCH - DAY

Villagers leave the church Claude is playing in the
cemetery Father Auguste frowns disapproving
Marguerite sees this and angrily pulls Roxanne aside

MARGUERITE
Take your brother home

Embarrassed Roxanne quickly grabs Claude and drags him
away but he fights her crying and kicking

Isabelles family is met by Henri and his father Adrien

ADRIEN
She was a good girl We all loved
her
Hes looking at Cesaire and shakes his hand but he
briefly glances at Suzette Isabelle notices the look
but then she spots Peter leaving the church She makes
brief eye contact with him before Henri interrupts

HENRI
Im here for you too
But her gaze follows Peter as he walks away

INT MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY

ATTEWATER the town bailiff presides over a gathering of
the Villagers Isabelle Suzette and Grandmother sit
with Cesaire who is angrily addressing the crowded room

CESATIRE
A line has been crossed The
beast must be destroyed

MERCHANT
Your daughter crossed the line
She went into the woods

CESATIRE
She was taken She must have
been

MERCHANT

So the Wolf broke into your home
and stole your daughter without
waking anyone or leaving any sign
at all

REEVE
Its been almost thirty years
since someone here was killed by
the Wolf Weve left it alone
Why would it suddenly come and
take one of us now
Grandmother gathers her nerve and stands up

GRANDMOTHER
I know something
Cesaire and Suzette give Grandmother surprised looks
She walks up to the table and hands Attewater the wadded
up washcloth we saw her with earlier

GRANDMOTHER
I found this I believe it must
belong to her attacker
Attewater unfolds the washcloth There are a few strands
of hair inside He gives her a sharp look

ATTEWATER
This is not animal hair

GRANDMOTHER
No it isnt Its human
A stunned silence comes over the room

ATTEWATER
No man could have done the things
that were done to your
granddaughter It must have been
the Wolf

GRANDMOTHER
Yet she was holding a mans hair
in her hand when she died

ATTEWATER
What are you suggesting

GRANDMOTHER
That the man and the Wolf may be
one and the same
A low MURMUR works its way through the crowd

ATTEWATER
A werewolf

FATHER AUGUSTE
It would explain much The Pope
himself has declared that such
creatures exist
The thought gives everyone pause

MERCHANT
Even if youre right it doesnt
help us The woods are filled
with hermits and strangers If
theres a werewolf among them how
will we find it

ATTEWATER
There are experts in these
matters Men who find and try
witches and werewolves We could
request the Church to send
someone
Grandmother gives him a sharp look

GRANDMOTHER
Not someone Youre talking about
Father Solomon
This sends a ripple of comment through the room

ATTEWATER
He is the Churchs most successful
werewolf hunter

ADRIEN
But what of his methods The man
once burned down an entire village
just to root out one witch

ATTEWATER
Unsubstantiated rumors The
Church has appointed him the
Witchfinder General of all
Christendom

FATHER AUGUSTE
That is also unsubstantiated
Attewater eyes him but Father Auguste stands his ground

ATTEWATER
I have the utmost confidence in
the ability of the Witchfinder
General to determine the nature of
the beast and put an end to it I
will dispatch a messenger in the
morning

CESAIRE
Even if Father Solomon agrees to
help us it will take weeks for
him to get here That means
another full moon Maybe two
We must defend ourselves
A long silent beat Then Henri stands

HENRI
Hes right The beast broke the
peace not us

(TO CESAIRE)
I will help you kill it
Henris father gives him a surprised look But after
another long beat the Reeve stands up too

REEVE
As will I We all will
Henri is nervous but tries to appear brave for Isabelle

INT ISABELLES FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAWN

Isabelle is about to leave when she sees Lucies red
riding hood She gives it a solemn look
EXT DARK FOREST - PATH - DAWN

A light snow has fallen The girls are walking to
Grandmothers house but Isabelle sadly lags behind lost
in thought Shes wearing Lucies red riding hood

Roxanne waits for Isabelle and offers her hand Isabelle
smiles sadly and takes it Prudence and Rosemaria let
them catch up then they continue on together

INT ISABELLES FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

Isabelle returns home Suzette is making dinner but
stops short when she sees Isabelle in Lucies red cloak

SUZETTE
Who gave you permission to wear
that

ISABELLE
Nobody I just --

SUZETTE

Your Grandmother made that for

Lucie Take it off

Isabelle hesitates then does as shes told Suzette
snatches the cloak away from her A beat

ISABELLE
It was folded when they found her
Her clothes too Did you notice
that

SUZETTE
Someone must have folded them
A beat Isabelle is reluctant to voice her thoughts
ISABELLE
She was so unhappy
Suzette turns her eyes narrowing dangerously

SUZETTE
What are you saying

ISABELLE
Maybe she went into the woods on
purpose Maybe she wanted to die
Suddenly Suzette slaps her across the face Hard

SUZETTE
Lucies soul is at peace with God
Dont you ever again suggest
otherwise
Suzette turns away in tears Isabelle is stunned
speechless

EXT PETERS COTTAGE - DAY

Isabelle trudges through the mud toward a ramshackle
cottage If there had been train tracks in the
fourteenth century this place would have been on the
wrong side of them

Isabelle gathers her nerve and knocks on the door A
long beat The door opens Its Peter He gives her a
surprised look She looks up at him choking back tears

PETER
Are you all right

ISABELLE
Im sorry I just need to talk to
someone Can I come in
Peter balks Just then a figure appears Isabelle
cant believe her eyes Its Rosemaria Shes
standing behind Peter but its clear that shes naked

ROSEMARIA
No You cant
She wraps an arm around Peters waist Isabelle gives
him a stricken look and runs away Peter watches her go
INT GRANDMOTHERS COTTAGE - DUSK

Lessons are over The girls are ready to leave except
for Isabelle who sits alone by the fire Rosemaria
gives her a sly look as she leaves When the girls have
gone Grandmother sits down next to Isabelle

ISABELLE
hate the cold Why cant we
have lessons in the summer

GRANDMOTHER
suppose that would be easier
But then that would defeat the
purpose People only change when
things are difficult
sabelle gives her a look understanding then turns
away Grandmother puts a hand on her shoulder and then
leaves her alone Isabelle stares into the fire

INT ROXANNES FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

Roxanne comes home to a shocking scene her mother
Marguerite half-naked and wrapped in a blanket

viciously beating Claude with a switch Roxanne
hurriedly pulls her off of him and he runs away

MARGUERITE
I caught the little bastard
watching us

ROXANNE

Watching what

Just then the Merchant enters from the bedroom
adjusting his clothes He hesitates when he sees
Roxanne then drops a handful of coins on the table and

leaves Marguerite puts the coins in a leather purse
Roxanne glares at her

MARGUERITE
Its money isnt it You could
make twice this your first time
They pay more for virgins
Roxanne recoils in disgust and storms out in tears

EXT VILLAGE - DUSK

The full moon sign swings in the wind a few flakes of
snow whipping through the air around it

INT BLACKSMITHS COTTAGE - DUSK

Adrien picks up a hammer and a pickaxe He hands the
hammer to Henri fixing him with a serious look

ADRIEN
Dont do this for Isabelle She
cant marry you if youre dead

HENRI

(LYING)
Im not doing it for her

ADRIEN
Your mother would be proud to see
the man youve become
Henri is moved He nods at a loss for words

INT TAVERN COTTAGE - DUSK
Not so much a tavern as the home of someone who decided
to brew some beer and sell it Cesaire stands before a

group of men Theyve all had too much to drink

CESATIRE
My father died trying to kill the
Wolf For forty years we have
lived in fear of it But no more
And never again We dont needa
Witchfinder General to rid of us
this hell-hated beast Because by
God and all that is holy the
Beast of Villiers la CroisA®e shall
die tonight
The men CHEER

EXT VILLAGE - DUSK

Cesaire leads the drunken group through the streets The
rest of the Villagers line the streets watching them go
Claude tries to join the hunters thinking its a game
but Roxanne quickly catches him Peter shakes his head
at the dubious spectacle Henri sees him

HENRI
Youre not coming with us

PETER
Are you joking These fools are
as likely to kill each other as
they are anything else
Henri shoots him an angry look before moving on
Isabelle and Suzette say goodbye to Cesaire Isabelle
sees Peter through the crowd and quickly looks away
Just then Henri and Adrien pass by On impulse
Isabelle runs up and kisses Henri on the mouth When
shes sure that Peter has seen this she quickly walks
away Henri gives Peter a gloating look Peter scowls

EXT DARK FOREST - DUSK

The Men have taken up positions just inside the treeline
one of them every twenty feet surrounding the village
They each have lit torches CAMERA FINDS Henri crouched
in the brush Cesaire walks along the line of men

CESATIRE
Get that torch out
Henri douses his torch

EXT DARK FOREST - NIGHT

The full moon is high in the night sky Snow is falling
CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES over the anxious face of the hunters
Adrien clutching his pickaxe The Reeve The Merchant
The Carpenter Shivering from cold and jangled nerves
staring wide-eyed into the dark and silent woods

INT ISABELLES FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

Isabelle lies in bed but still awake Suddenly a
wolf HOWLS outside Her eyes widen

EXT DARK FOREST - NIGHT

The Reeve hears it He clutches an old sword Nearby
the Merchant cowers in the brush Adrien listens as the
wolf HOWLS over and over louder each time The
Carpenter nervously peers out from his cover

INT ISABELLES FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - NIGHT

The HOWLING is getting closer Isabelle goes to the
window opens the shutter cautiously peers out and is
startled by a HORRIBLE SCREAM in the distance

EXT DARK FOREST - NIGHT

The Carpenter hears the SCREAM too He runs toward it

and finds an extinguished torch on the ground There are
footprints in the snow And blood The brush around him
RUSTLES and he jumps to his feet axe held at the ready --
-- but its just the other Men led by the Reeve

REEVE
Who was that screaming

CARPENTER
I dont know

MERCHANT
Look
Hes gone pale The others follow his look Theres a
LARGE PAW PRINT in the snow The Men stare at it
Suddenly the same SCREAM pierces the night this time
coming from deeper in the woods The Men exchange a wary
look but then start after it

They run into a still clearing where the snow-covered
brush is as high as their waists They pause and listen
Only silence They carefully make their way in the
direction of the screams quiet Frost-brittle leaves
CRUNCH under their feet
Suddenly -- something is moving in the brush All they
can see is the snowy brush violently shaking as it darts
off almost faster than it can be followed with the eye
It races right by the Merchant knocking him on his ass
but its gone before he can get a look at it
He startles as the Reeve pulls him to his feet

REEVE
Which way did it go
The Merchant points a trembling finger The Reeve
plunges into the brush after it and the Men follow

EXT DARK FOREST - HILLSIDE - NIGHT

The Reeve leads the Men to the foot of a steep and rocky
hill Its a dead end But then they hear the SCREAMS
again The Men look up at the hillside

CARPENTER
The caves Its in the caves

INT CAVE - NIGHT

The Men stand in the mouth of a wide cave relighting
their torches The SCREAMING echoes from inside The
Carpenter raises his torch The cave is as deep and dark
as a monsters throat The Men crowd start inside

The SCREAMING continues unnerving the Men as they
approach Then they come to a fork in the tunnel The
SCREAMS bounce off the stone walls Impossible to tell
where its coming from

REEVE
Split up Two groups

Half the Men take one fork half the other We follow
the Reeves group down a narrowing passageway The Men
crowd together hunched low The SCREAMS seem to be
getting louder The Reeve stops listening

He turns toward a low crack in the cave wall The
SCREAMS are coming from inside He shines his torch
inside lowers his head and walks toward it The cave

floor takes a steep dip He has to keep one hand on the
wall to keep from falling
Then suddenly his feet skid on a patch of loose pebbles
and he loses his footing He slides down the steep
floor drops his torch hands flailing unable to stop
himself and then --
-- he finds himself falling off a low cliff into the
darkness He tumbles head over heels down a rocky slope
and splashes hard in a shallow underground river The
torch rolls off the ledge above and falls on the shore
amidst a shower of grit and pebbles
The Reeve gets up grimacing in pain grabs the torch
He shines it around and sees Adrien Hes leaning
against a rock the ground beneath him wet with blood
spreading from a dark wound between his legs
Reeve rushes to his side and crosses himself when he sees
the wound Then a low menacing GROWL He turns
Theres a huge SNARLING GRAY WOLF behind him Adriens
pickaxe juts from between its shoulder blades
Reeve freezes suddenly realizing that hes dropped his
sword He splashes around in the river blindly feeling
for it in the water The wounded animal growls blood
bubbling from between its teeth Reeve finds the sword --
-- just as the wolf attacks

EXT VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - DAWN
Silence The sun is starting to light the sky revealing

a peacefully glistening blanket of snow on the village
The Men are returning from the woods Isabelle and
Suzette are among the Villagers breathlessly awaiting
them No way of telling whether they met with success or
failure But as they near

we can see Reeve leading the group carrying a pike
with the wolfs severed head on it The Villagers CHEER
but the Men are weary and subdued Suzette and Isabelle
find Cesaire He hugs them tight
Suddenly a woman GASPS Then they see the Men are
carrying Adriens body on a travois Suzette chokes back
her reaction Henri walks with the body eyes red and
cried out He passes Isabelle without looking at her

EXT BLACKSMITHS COTTAGE - DAY

Henri hammers at a red-hot iron horseshoe Isabelle
enters Henri doesnt seem to notice A hesitant beat

ISABELLE
I heard your father wounded the
beast He was a brave man

HENRI
Did you hear what it did to him
It chewed off his private parts
Isabelle had not heard this Henri doesnt stop working

HENRI
And I did nothing I was too
scared I couldnt move I just
let my father be eaten alive
She moves toward him but he shrugs her away

HENRI
No I dont want you here
Isabelle gives him a sad look then leaves Henri just
keeps hammering away on the anvil

EXT CHURCH - DAY
A coffin is lowered into a grave Father Auguste blesses

it Henri stands at his side Isabelle is here with
Roxanne Lucrece eyes Isabelle then whispers to her
LUCRECE
I thought your mother would be
here They used to be quite
close
Isabelle gives her a sharp look but Lucrece says nothing
more Isabelle looks down at the coffin with a sudden
realization

EXT ISABELLES FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY

Suzette is soaking clothes in a bucket of lye crying as
she works Isabelle approaches Suzette quickly wipes
her eyes A beat Isabelle gathers her nerve then

ISABELLE
You told me you had a sweetheart
before you were married It was
Henris father wasnt it

Suzette freezes She faces Isabelle but doesnt answer

ISABELLE
Lucie was in love with Henri She
could have married him
(off Suzettes look)
Couldnt she have

SUZETTE
We arranged for you to marry him

ISABELLE
But you gained the same no matter
which one of us married him So
why did it have to be me

SUZETTE
I think you know the answer to
that question
ISABELLE
No You say it
Suzettes eyes well up Then

SUZETTE
Lucie was Henris half-sister
She was not your fathers
daughter
Isabelle suddenly looks ill Reluctant she asks

ISABELLE
Am I Do you even know

SUZETTE
Yes I was already pregnant when
your father and I married

ISABELLE
Does he know

SUZETTE
No And he must never know
Tears spill down Isabelles cheeks She walks away

SUZETTE
Isabelle

(BEAT)
Promise me you wont tell him
Isabelle gives her a look that doesnt promise much She
leaves without answering

INT GRANDMOTHERS COTTAGE - NIGHT

Grandmother ladles soup into a bowl and brings it to
Isabelle Isabelles eyes are red from crying

GRANDMOTHER
Ive found that theres no burden
that doesnt at least seem a
little lighter on a full stomach
ISABELLE
I dont know what to do She
wants me to pretend like I dont
know How am I supposed to go on
living in that house

GRANDMOTHER
You have a right to be angry with
her But try not to hate her
Too much hate will eat you alive
Isabelle nods and rests her head on Grandmothers
shoulder

EXT VILLAGE - NIGHT

As Isabelle enters the village she hears LAUGHING and
CAROUSING Every cottage in the village is dark Except
one Isabelle gathers her nerve and turns toward it

INT TAVERN HOUSE - NIGHT

Isabelle tentatively enters There arent many people
here just Marguerite and a few ROWDY MEN making a lot of
noise Isabelle instantly sees what shes here for
Cesaire is slumped in a corner drunk and passed out

INT ISABELLES FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Isabelle steers Cesaire through the doorway and drops him
into the bed next to Suzette Hes already half-asleep
Suzette gives Isabelle a silent look then turns away
Isabelle sighs She sits next to Cesaire and kisses his
forehead As she stands he clumsily takes her hand

CESATIRE
Youre a good girl

Isabelle allows a sad smile places his hand back on his
chest and leaves

EXT VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY
The wolfs head has been placed atop a stake Children
throw rocks at it Isabelle watches with Roxanne and
Prudence

PRUDENCE
I heard theres going to be a
festival on the night of the next
full moon To celebrate

ROXANNE
A festival Ive never been to
one

PRUDENCE

My father says he hasnt seen one
since he was a boy

ROXANNE

Its strange isnt it You think
because things have been a certain
way your whole life that theyll
always be the same Then
overnight everything just changes
But Isabelle is distracted Amidst the morning bustle
she sees Rosemaria laughing with Peter Roxanne notices
Just then they hear HORSES approaching A lot of them
Everyone stops what theyre doing listening suddenly
apprehensive The girls turn toward the sound and see

A DOZEN SOLDIERS in identical armor silver helmets
gleaming in the sun riding into the square atop armored
steeds The Villagers gape at them in awe
The Soldiers ride escort to a WHITE COACH with a red
cross on it drawn by two horses one white one black
A FIGURE rides inside cloaked in darkness Isabelle
gives it an uneasy look
Leading the Soldiers is the CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD his
helmet adorned with a blood-red plume He brings the
caravan to a halt in front of the Merchants shop

CAPTAIN
This is Villiers la CroisA©e

MERCHANT
Yes my lord

CAPTAIN
Summon your bailiff My master
would speak with him at once

MERCHANT
Of course my lord May I ask to
what does he owe this honor

CAPTAIN
He requested the services of His
Eminence the Witchfinder General
You may tell him that he has
arrived
All eyes turn to the figure in the coach Only a
bejeweled hand is visible resting on the coachs window

EXT VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY (LATER)

A Soldier places a wooden step next to the coach and
another opens the door The whole village has turned

out but theyre keeping their distance Even Attewater
standing front and center seems uneasy

The figure emerges from the coach A grizzled man with
penetrating eyes and a black beard wearing a strange
amalgam of priestly white robes and decidedly un-priestly
battle armor A broadsword hangs from his hip the hilt
depicting Christ on the cross With the sword sheathed
the cross is upside-down This is FATHER SOLOMON

ATTEWATER
This is indeed an honor Your
Eminence
Solomon makes no response His eyes are on the severed
wolfs head on display Attewater smiles proudly

ATTEWATER
As you can see our werewolf
problem has been dealt with

SOLOMON
That is no werewolf
Surprise and outrage ripple through the crowd Isabelle
and Roxanne exchange a shocked look

SOLOMON
When a werewolf dies it returns
to its human form If what you
killed was a werewolf then you
would have a human head skewered
atop that pole

REEVE
And I suppose youve seen this A
wolf turning into a man

Solomon levels a look at the Reeve and slowly walks
toward him The Reeve is taller but Solomon is without
doubt the bigger man The Reeves eyes flick nervously
to the armored Soldiers and their swords A beat

SOLOMON
My wifes name was PAOnAlope She
was very pretty And we were very
happy
The Reeve tries to keep the confusion off his face
Attewater and Father Auguste exchange uncertain looks

SOLOMON
We lived in a village not unlike
this place And not unlike this
place our village was plagued by
a werewolf I went out with some
men to hunt it It never even
occurred to me that we might
actually find it But we did
He has everyones attention now All eyes are on him

SOLOMON
It attacked me All I saw were
yellow teeth I hacked at it with
an axe and suddenly it was gone
There was blood on my axe I had
cut off one of its paws I picked
it up and put it in my sack
(BEAT)
When I returned home in the
morning I found my wife with a
bloody rag tied around her left
wrist And when I opened my sack
the werewolfs paw was gone This
is what I found in its place
Solomon takes an old leather sack from his belt reaches
inside and pulls out a WOMANS MUMMIFIED HAND wearing
a wedding ring There are gasps from the crowd

SOLOMON
Her name was PAOnA©lope She was
very pretty And we were very
happy Until the day I killed
her
Solomon turns and gives Attewater a hard look

SOLOMON
Your werewolf is still alive And
I promise you it will kill again

INT MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT

Soldiers stand at every door Solomon and Attewater sit
in front of the gathered Villagers Solomons Captain
stands behind him Isabelle nervously notes that the
Captain wears a spiked flail The black iron ball is
shaped like a skull with spikes coming out of it

SOLOMON
I have examined the body of your
blacksmith There were bruises on
his neck from where the beast held
him in its jaws squeezing his
throat so that he could not
scream

CESATIRE
But he did scream We all heard
him
SOLOMON
Only when it wanted you to It
used him as bait to lure you into
the bit of theater it had
prepared

HENRI
Theater My father is not
playacting He is dead

REEVE
And I killed the beast that did
it

SOLOMON

Thats what it wants you to think
It did kill your blacksmith But
the animal that you killed was not
the werewolf

REEVE
There was blood dripping from its
teeth

SOLOMON

The blood was its own The
werewolf most likely wounded it
earlier in the evening and left it
in the cave for you to find and
kill

CESAIRE
eMost likely U) he says Have you
ever heard anything more unlikely

in your lives

The Villagers laugh Lucrece eyes them disapproving
ATTEWATER
Your Eminence if what you say is
true that we were somehow fooled
by this thing it could not have
done so without foreknowledge of
our plan to hunt it

SOLOMON
Thats correct The werewolf does
not live in the forest as you have
rather naA vely assumed It lives
here in the village Among you
There is a moment of shocked silence Then mounting
anger Cesaire stands up and gestures to Henri

CESAIRE
You come here and tell us that
this boys father died for
nothing You accuse us and call
us fools Well I believe what I
can see with my own eyes That
wolf is dead And I know its
dead because I was with the brave
men who killed it

MERCHANT
And what of the festival

ATTEWATER
The festival was to celebrate the
death of the Wolf

MERCHANT
And we say that its dead Weve
spent every full moon for the past
forty years cowering in our homes
Weve earned a celebration

REEVE
And paid for it in blood
Attewater gives Solomon a nervous look Solomon shrugs

SOLOMON
Have your festival I will stay
on here until then to ensure that
you have the celebration you all
so richly deserve
The Villagers seem appeased especially the smug
Merchant A look passes between Solomon and his Captain
Isabelle catches it and finds it unsettling

EXT VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY

The moon sign displays the angry full moon but it has
been decorated with ribbons and mistletoe Despite the
cold the mood in the village is happy and excited

INT CHURCH - DAY

He kisses the image of Christ on the hilt of his sword

EXT VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY

The festival is in full swing A bonfire ROARS The
Villagers sing and drink A MAN in a wolf costume jumps
out and startles the women and children The children
chase him with sticks and he comically runs away
Isabelle watches their antics with Roxanne and Prudence
Claude is laughing and chasing the man in the wolf
costume but an OLDER BOY purposefully trips him
Another BOY steals his cap and teases him Marguerite is
too busy carousing to notice Roxanne frowns

ROXANNE
Im sorry

She hurries to help Claude Isabelle and Prudence watch

PRUDENCE
She acts more like a mother to him
than a sister

ISABELLE
Someone has to look after him

PRUDENCE
I know But who looks after her
Isabelle gives Roxanne a sad look

EXT CHURCH - BELLTOWER - DUSK

The Captain of Solomons guard stands watch The sounds
of the FESTIVAL can be heard in the distance

EXT VILLAGE - SQUARE - DUSK

Men play MUSIC and couples dance Roxanne dances with
Claude Prudence with an OLDER BOY but Isabelle sits
alone watching Peter dance with Rosemaria
Just then Henri stumbles toward Isabelle with a beer
clearly the latest of many He follows her look and sees
that shes watching Peter Henri glares at him

then abruptly pushes his way toward Peter and grabs
him roughly by the shoulder spinning him around Peter
is surprised but ready to laugh it off

PETER
Take it easy friend
HENRI
You didnt come with us The
night my father died
Peters smile fades Isabelle rushes to pull Henri away

HENRI
You stayed here and let real men
do the work you didnt have the
belly for

ISABELLE
Please dont do this --
Henri brushes her aside but too hard and she stumbles
Peter instantly grabs hold of Henris wrist Henri

overreacts and punches Peter in the eye Peter falls on
his ass but the Villagers just laugh
Peter slowly stands staring Henri down He could easily
lay Henri out but decides against it He leaves
Rosemaria reaches out to him but he ignores her
Isabelle shoots Henri a look of contempt then hurries
off after Peter Henri watches her go ashamed

EXT VILLAGE - ROAD - DUSK
Peter storms off Isabelle runs after him

Why So you can hit me too

Peter stops He whirls on Isabelle incredulous
PETER
Why cant you just leave me alone

ISABELLE
Youre bleeding

PETER
So what Whats the matter with
you What do I have to do to make
you stop caring about me
Isabelle is taken aback A beat

ISABELLE
You think I want to feel like
this You think I enjoy feeling
like a fool every day because I
cant stop loving you
Peters bravado falters He cant completely hide what
her words do to him She looks up at him realizing

ISABELLE
Why are you with Rosemaria You
hate Rosemaria

PETER
I dont have to like her to get
what I want from her

ISABELLE
Youre a terrible liar
Isabelle takes a step closer and presses the palm of her
hand against his chest A beat

ISABELLE
There Youre heart is starting
to beat faster And the little
black circles in the middle of
your eyes still get bigger when I
touch you
She gazes up at him He tries not to look in her eyes
but cant stop himself

ISABELLE

You can tell me you dont love me

but I know what youre really

feeling I can feel it with my

hand and see it with my eyes

Peter hesitates then covers her hand with his own

PETER
thought being with Rosemaria
would be the one thing you would
never be able to forgive I
wanted you to hate me
(off her look)
Isabelle you are the best thing
that could ever happen to me And
I am the worst thing that could
ever happen to you

ISABELLE
How could you think that

PETER
I wasnt born here You and I
both know what that means I will
always be a stranger to these
people Your parents will never
let us be together

ISABELLE
That means less to me now than
ever We can leave here We can
go someplace where well both be
strangers

PETER
I cant let you do that You have
something here that I will never
have You have a place You have

(MORE )

PETER (CONTD)

future Im not going to let you
ruin that over me

ISABELLE
The only life I want is with you

PETER
Isabelle Im wrong for you
ISABELLE
I know you are I just dont

care
She kisses him on the mouth then quickly steps back as
if she did it before she could change her mind Then he
takes her in his arms and they kiss long and hard

INT BARN - DUSK

A door opens and Peter and Isabelle enter still kissing
He closes the door pushes her against it with his body
He lowers her to pile of straw in an empty stall She
looks up at him surprised then pulls him tightly to
her kissing him hard She grabs his hand and guides it
to her breast Now Peter looks surprised He hesitates

ISABELLE
I dont want to wait

PETER
But not like this

(A BEAT)

She searches his face and sees that hes serious

PETER

can leave in the morning
(off her look)

ISABELLE
ts not soon enough

She pulls him to her and kisses him
EXT BARN - DUSK

Peter looks outside The coast is clear He and
Isabelle slip out and close the door behind them

PETER
Youd better get back before
someone misses you
She gives him a lingering kiss When she pulls away from
him he sees that shes crying

PETER
Whats wrong

ISABELLE

This feels like a dream Im

afraid if I leave you I might wake

up

He kisses her and holds her tight Neither of them
notice Henri angrily watching from the shadows

EXT VILLAGE - SQUARE - NIGHT

Isabelle returns to the festival She sits next to
Roxanne who notices a piece of straw in Isabelles hair
Isabelle quickly brushes it away embarrassed

Isabelles eyes go to the sky The sun has finally set
The moon has risen silver and full Isabelle gazes up
at it transfixed Roxanne looks over at her curious

ISABELLE
Ive never seen it full before
Suddenly -- the CHURCH BELLS start to ring Everyone
falls silent Confused looks all around Then
somewhere in the dark
a WOLF HOWLS The Villagers gasp A WOMAN screams
People start to panic Claude is knocked down

ROXANNE
Claude
Then something massive pushes its way through the surging
crowd bursting from the darkness
Its THE WOLF The Villagers gape in horror It makes
the wolf that they killed look like a chihuahua But
theres something about its face that isnt canine at
all but ghoulishly human as it HOWLS at the moon
Suddenly a group of Villagers throw off their cloaks
revealing themselves to be Solomons armored Soldiers
Each of them draws a gleaming sword and points it at the
Wolf Theyve been lying in wait and now they have it
surrounded The Wolf SNARLS at them

A moment later Father Solomon gallops into the square on
his armored steed wearing a helmet adorned with a golden
eagle He tugs the reins and his horse rears back

SOLOMON
Get to the church you fools
The Wolf SNARLS up at him Solomon gives a battle cry

SOLOMON
DIE BEAST AND LONG LIVE GODS

HOLY LOVE

The Wolf ROARS Solomon and his men charge toward it
The Villagers caught between them trample one another to
get away A MAN gets knocked into the bonfire Flaming
logs fall off the pyre and set a cottage ABLAZE

The Wolf swipes Solomons Soldiers aside like rag dolls
They bravely press the attack but theyre no match for
the beast It swats one of them right through the wall
of a nearby cottage The ambush has backfired

The Carpenter sees Claude on the ground and picks him up
trying to help Claude fights and screams but the
Carpenter carries him away Roxanne starts toward him --
-- and is bowled over by Solomons horse Solomon grabs
the stake with the wolfs head atop it and charges at the
Wolf wielding the stake like a lance The Wolf catches
the stake in its jaws throwing Solomon off his horse
Just as the Wolf is about to pounce on him but more
Soldiers join the fight The Wolf sees them coming It
attacks Solomons horse biting its neck and dragging it
to the ground As the Soldiers close in --

-- the Wolf spins around hurling the injured horse at
them knocking them down like bowling pins Another
Soldier tries to attack the Wolf from behind but it
smacks him aside with its tail and then smashes him to
the ground with one enormous paw

Isabelle hurriedly helps Roxanne to her feet and drags
her away from the ongoing battle

ROXANNE
Wheres Claude Where is he

EXT VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

The Carpenter runs away with Claude in his arms but
Claude bites his hand and wriggles free Claude falls to
the ground and dashes back toward the square

EXT VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

Roxanne runs through town like a rat in a maze jostled
by the fleeing Villagers Isabelle races after her

ROXANNE
Claude Claude
Roxanne spots Rosemaria and grabs her begging for help

ROXANNE
Have you seen my brother Please
But Rosemaria just pushes her aside panicked An
instant later -- the Wolf appears out of nowhere jumping
on Rosemaria She screams then -- CRUNCH The screams
stop Isabelle and Roxanne gape in horror then run
EXT CHURCH - BELLTOWER - NIGHT

The Captain RINGS the church bell People are fleeing
the village and running toward the church

EXT VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

The few Villagers left hurry into their homes and bolt
the doors behind them TWO SOLDIERS search the nearly
empty streets for the Wolf swords drawn
Soldier 1 looks down and sees bloody paw prints in
the snow He points them out to Solider 2 They follow
the tracks to a corner carefully peer around it
The Wolf is about ten feet away loudly tearing meat from
Rosemarias body Soldier 1 gestures for his companion
to approach from the other side They split up
Soldier 1 peers out at the Wolf but its gone The
street is empty Only Rosemarias body lying in the
bloodstained snow He ducks back around the corner
and we see that the Wolf is now right behind him
Meanwhile Soldier 2 is stealthily making his way into
position when he suddenly hears Soldier 1 SCREAMING
Soldier 2 quickly ducks inside a nearby cottage

INT COTTAGE - NIGHT

and peers out the window He sees Soldier 1
painfully crawling through the snow clutching a mangled
and bloody wound on his shoulder

SOLDIER 1
Help Help me

Soldier 2 ducks back from the window No way Hes not

going out there Then SNIFF SNIFF

Theres a shadow visible under the crack of the cottage

door And a big black snout pressed up against it

SNIFFING out its prey Soldier 2 readies his sword
but then the Wolf moves away A long beat The
Soldier edges toward the door The shadow does not
return He slowly reaches out a hand to open the door
Suddenly the door is blasted off its hinges and the Wolf
bursts inside It stands on top of the door pinning the
Soldier beneath it The Soldier tries to raise his

sword but cant The Wolf SNARLS down at him drooling

EXT VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

The Wolf is dragging Soldier 2s body out of the cottage
by the ankles when its ears suddenly prick up Its
heard something Its being watched It looks up

and sees Claude standing at the end of the street
paralyzed with fear The Wolf GROWLS blood dripping
from its chin Claude runs The Wolf leaps after him
Claude turns a corner looks back sees the Wolf headed
right for him Claude ducks into an alley and the Wolf
follows him

EXTINT BARN NIGHT

only to find Claude has disappeared The Wolf
follows Claudes tracks in the snow to the door of a barn
and peers inside The barn appears to be empty

but Claude is hiding in a hayloft The Wolf SNIFFS
the air Pushes the door open with its nose and pads
inside Looks around Claude shivers But just then

ROXANNE (0S)
Claude Claude
The Wolf cocks its ears toward the voice listening

EXT VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

Isabelle and Roxanne are the last stragglers Roxanne
looking for Claude Isabelle trying to stop her

ROXANNE
Claude Where are you
Isabelle drags her to the ground and covers her mouth

ISABELLE
You have to stop it He cant
hear you and you are going to get
us killed Do you understand me
Roxanne nods crying Isabelle helps her up -- and finds
herself face-to-face with the Wolf Roxanne screams
They run back the way they came turn another corner --

EXT VILLAGE - ALLEY - NIGHT
-- but the narrow alley is blocked by a high stone wall

ISABELLE

Come on
Isabelle climbs the wall but Roxannes not going to make
it Isabelle jumps down to help her

just as the Wolfs shadow falls over the alley The
girls watch helplessly as the Wolf slowly walks toward
them SNARLING and glaring at them with its strange near-
human eyes Then inexplicably the Wolf speaks

THE WOLF
Well well You look very pretty
this evening my dear Good
enough to eat
The Wolfs voice is sonorous seductive The Devils
voice Isabelle stammers unable to believe her senses

THE WOLF
Its considered polite to thank
someone when they pay you a
compliment Are you being
impolite Isabelle

ISABELLE
How do you know me Who are you

ROXANNE
Isabelle
The Wolf GROWLS cutting her off and turns back to
Isabelle It moves closer Isabelle looks into its
eyes They suddenly seem very big and deep almost
hypnotizing She seems to fall into them

ISABELLE
What big eyes you have

THE WOLF
The better to see you with my
dear

ISABELLE

Are you going to kill us

THE WOLF
Kill you Why would I kill you

ISABELLE
Then what do you want

THE WOLF
I want you Isabelle
Isabelle gapes dumbstruck and dismayed

THE WOLF
We are the same you and I We
are both wild things You show
one face to the world but there
is another face that you hide A
fire burning inside you waiting
to be released
The Wolf sniffs her starting at her feet and working its
way up It SNARLS with satisfaction savoring her scent

THE WOLF
Yes I can smell it on you even
now
Suddenly the Wolf jumps onto its hind legs puts its
forepaws on the wall on either side of Isabelle its
muzzle only inches from her face She recoils

THE WOLF
Leave with me tonight Run with
me The only shackles binding you
are of your own making Slip them
and I can show you the world and
every pleasure in it
Isabelle hesitates then finds the strength to speak

ISABELLE
I dont know who you are but we
are not the same I would rather
die than go with you

THE WOLF
What about your fat friend here
Do you think she would rather die
(off Isabelles look)
Come away with me Or I will kill
her And I will keep killing
until you agree to leave with me
Suddenly the sound of MEN SHOUTING The Wolf leans in
SNARLING Isabelle turns away from its foul breath

THE WOLF

Choose now Quickly

Isabelle trembles She looks down at Roxannes terrified
face torn Isabelle closes her eyes She cant do it

THE WOLF

Your silence has doomed them all

Just then Solomon and two Soldiers turn the corner The
Wolf leaps atop the wall and growls down at Isabelle

THE WOLF
Come the next full moon their
blood will be on your hands
Then it jumps over the wall Solomon scrabbles up after
it but the Wolf is already too far away It looks back
at him A silent challenge passes between them And
then the Wolf is gone

INT CHURCH - NIGHT

Solomon and his Soldiers bring Isabelle and Roxanne
inside A crowd of panicked Villagers swarms to Solomon

SOLOMON
We are safe here God protects
his own house and those within it
Isabelle finds Prudence

ISABELLE
Is Peter here

PRUDENCE
Peter I dont think so

ISABELLE
What about Claude Or my parents

PRUDENCE
I havent seen any of them

ISABELLE
Would you look for them Please

Prudence nods and rushes off Roxanne slumps in a

corner a dazed look on her face

ROXANNE
You talked to it

ISABELLE
It talked to us

A chill runs down Roxannes spine

ROXANNE
No It only growled
(off Isabelles look)
You heard it talk to you

Isabelle doesnt know what to say
see if anyone has overheard Then

A beat

A long beat

She glances around to
ISABELLE
Do not speak of this to anyone
Roxanne nods but eyes Isabelle warily Isabelle turns
away afraid and confused

EXT CHURCH - DAWN

Silence The door CREAKS open and the Merchant peers
out A blanket of new snow covers the village Its as
if the massacre of the night before never happened

INT ISABELLES FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAWN

Isabelle hurries inside Embers burn in the fire pit A
chair has been overturned The room is empty

ISABELLE

INT ISABELLES FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DAWN

Isabelle bursts in to find Suzette lying in bed and
Cesaire leaning over her crying Isabelle stops short

ISABELLE
Is she dead

CESATIRE
No thank God

He sits up revealing Suzettes face which has been
horribly slashed from scalp to chin Isabelle recoils

EXT VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAWN

The Villagers slowly gather Dead bodies litter the
snow Roxanne clutches Prudences arm Henri joins
them Father Auguste crouches next to Soldier 1
FATHER AUGUSTE
This man is alive

(TO HENRI)
Bring me water Hurry
Henri nods and quickly turns -- but is stopped cold by
Solomons iron grip on his arm Solomon and his Captain
go to Soldier 1 Solomon kneels at his side

SOLOMON
Are you bitten
Shivering the Soldier nods The Captain closes his
eyes Solomon stands and turns to Father Auguste

SOLOMON
Step back
Confused Father Auguste does as hes told Then before
anyone can react Solomon draws his sword and plunges it
into the Soldiers heart Everyone startles

SOLOMON
The werewolfs bite is the same as
death to a man
Stunned silence Solomon turns to the Villagers

SOLOMON
The dark days have returned to
your village Your homes are no
longer safe The Wolf will
return Again and again And it
will not stop until it has sucked
the marrow from all your bones
Unless you stop it

(BEAT)
But to kill a monster you must
become one yourself A wolf
caught in a trap will chew off its
own leg to save itself Will you
do the same What sacrifice will
you make to save your families and
your way of life Will you do
whatever it takes Or will you

(MORE )

SOLOMON (CONTD)
cower in your beds and die like
sheep
A long beat The Villagers shiver and not just from the
cold But no one speaks Solomon turns to Attewater

SOLOMON
It appears my expertise is not as
appreciated as I was led to
believe
He turns to leave Suddenly Attewater steps forward

ATTEWATER
Wait
Attewater drops to one knee Solomon stops and gives him
an appraising look Then Solomon turns to the Villagers
After a moment the Reeve drops to his knee One by one
the Villagers kneel to Solomon Henri and Father Auguste
are among the last but they reluctantly kneel as well

ATTEWATER
We will do what must be done
A beat Then Solomon offers his hand Attewater kisses
Solomons ring Henri and Roxanne exchange uneasy looks

INT PETERS COTTAGE - DAY

Theres an urgent knock at the door Peter quickly opens
it Its Isabelle He ushers her inside As soon as

the door is shut he takes her in his arms She gives
him a concerned look He looks tired drawn and pale

PETER
was up all night worrying about
you Thank God youre safe
But something about her expression gives him pause She
looks up at him struggling with what she has to say

ISABELLE
Peter My mothers hurt I
cant leave Not now

PETER
thought you didnt want to wait

ISABELLE
I dont have any choice Its not
just my mother Something else
happened last night
(off his look)

(MORE )

ISABELLE (CONTD)
I cant tell you about it I just
have to stay
Peter nods but his face darkens A long tense beat

ISABELLE
I meant everything I said This
isnt what I wanted

PETER
Of course not Youd better go
home and see to your mother
She gives him a sad nod then turns to go She pauses at
the door but he doesnt look at her She leaves

INT MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT

Solomon places his silver sword on the table in front of
Attewater and Father Auguste

SOLOMON
Silver This is our most potent
weapon One blow will kill it

(BEAT)
That sword has tasted the blood of
many such creatures But never
one as powerful as this
ATTEWATER
If its that powerful how can we
possibly hope to stop it

SOLOMON
We must find it in its human form
Who among you do you suspect
Attewater and Father Auguste trade uncomfortable looks
Neither of them wants to speak up first

SOLOMON
It has not survived this long by
being obvious The signs will be
subtle Insomnia Restlessness
Strange behavior Strange smells
(off their looks)
Well none of them smell good but
we must start somewhere

FATHER AUGUSTE
What about the hair Madame
Ordeville found on Lucies body
It was dark The person we are
looking for must have dark hair

SOLOMON
Perhaps Unless it planted the
hair to make us think that

ATTEWATER
Yes its trying to trick us
again This has been happening
for forty years It must be an
old man by now The hair should
have been gray

SOLOMON
Not necessarily It may be the
child or grandchild of the
werewolf that first struck here

FATHER AUGUSTE
The curse is hereditary

SOLOMON
It is But it effects men and
women differently A man can
inherit the curse Or he can be
turned simply by being bitten
Solomon turns toward the fire and stares into it

SOLOMON
But women are immune to the
werewolfs bite In order for a
woman to be turned she must
inherit the curse But even then
it will lie dormant unless she
eats human flesh Only then will
the bite of a male werewolf change
her Only then can she become a
werewolf and capable of passing
the curse on to her own children

ATTEWATER
But it could be a woman

SOLOMON
Of course It could be any one of
you
Attewater and Father Auguste exchange a wary look

EXT VILLAGE - CROSSROADS - DAWN

Roxanne nods unconvinced Prudence joins them They
all exchange a sad look

Word of this cannot be allowed to
spread Do you understand me

ISABELLE
Roxanne will never speak of it
She wont even talk to me about

A long beat Isabelle is working up her nerve Then

ISABELLE
I have to do what it wants
(off her look)
I have communed with an unholy
beast What does that make me if
not cursed

GRANDMOTHER
I dont know But I wont allow
you to go with this devil and live
as its concubine

ISABELLE
But if it comes back for me and I
dont go with it then it will
kill again If I have the power
to save even one life arent I
compelled to do so

Isabelle finds Roxanne in tears trying to force her way
through the crowd

ISABELLE
Whats wrong Whats happening
Roxanne doesnt answer just plunges into the crowd
Isabelle goes in after her Cesaire tries to stop her

CESATIRE

She follows Roxanne to the front of the crowd just as

two Soldiers haul a figure out of a barn -- its Claude
ROXANNE

Claude
ISABELLE

Its not him It cant be

The Soldiers carry Claude off and Roxanne stumbles after
them Isabelle tries to follow but Cesaire stops her
She can only watch helplessly as Claude is dragged away

EXT MANOR HOUSE - DAY

Villagers are gathering The whole town must be here
As Attewater approaches the entrance

Salus populi suprema est lex

He turns and sees Grandmother walking toward him She
nods to the inscription above the entrance eSALUS

POPULI SUPREMA EST LEX

GRANDMOTHER
The good of the people is the
chief law

ATTEWATER
You read Latin

GRANDMOTHER
And write I was studying to be a
nun when I met my husband

ATTEWATER
He must have been some man

GRANDMOTHER
He was a priest
She grins Is she being serious Attewater bristles

GRANDMOTHER
You know the boy is innocent
Hes being tried because hes
different Because Father Solomon
knows he can turn us against him

ATTEWATER
Father Solomon is here to protect
us

GRANDMOTHER

A wolf hunting sheep picks off the

weakest ones first

(off his look)

This is just the beginning

She enters the manor hall Attewater watches her go

INT MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY

The room is crammed with Villagers Isabelle sits with
Cesaire and Grandmother Attewater sits behind the
table Claude is shackled and guarded by Soldiers He
looks afraid confused Solomon questions Lucrece A
SCRIBE records the proceedings

SOLOMON
You say you saw the accused
perform magic

LUCRECE
In broad daylight with my own
eyes Everyone here has seen it

SOLOMON
So it was common knowledge that
the accused was a conjurer

LUCRECE
Yes Your Eminence I saw it for
the Devils work but they laughed

at me and paid him money

Isabelle and Grandmother exchange a concerned look
Through a SERIES OF CUTS more witnesses are questioned

FATHER AUGUSTE
shifts uncomfortably as Solomon interrogates him

SOLOMON
Are you aware that it is the
custom of witches and devil
worshippers to hold their black
sabbaths in cemeteries

FATHER AUGUSTE
Yes Your Eminence

SOLOMON
And do you know of their practice
of dancing with invisible devils
during these rituals

FATHER AUGUSTE
I have heard it said so yes

SOLOMON
Is there one here today who you
have seen dancing in your
cemetery

FATHER AUGUSTE
(hesitant a beat)
Yes But I dont believe he meant
anything by it It was in jest

SOLOMON
So you consider the black mass to
be a jest
There are suspicious WHISPERS among the Villagers
Father Auguste eyes them nervously A beat

FATHER AUGUSTE
No of course not

SOLOMON
Then point him out
Father Auguste reluctantly points to Claude

MARGUERITE
Roxanne weeps as her mother testifies against Claude

SOLOMON
What is your relationship to the
accused

MARGUERITE

I am his mother

SOLOMON
And where is his father

MARGUERITE
I dont know sir

SOLOMON
Well what is his name
She pauses The crowd eyes her disapproving A beat

MARGUERITE
I never learned his name sir

SOLOMON
You say a man whose name you
cannot recall is the father of
your child What can you tell us
about him

MARGUERITE
Not much sir
She lowers her eyes ashamed Solomon considers her

SOLOMON
Almost as if it were a dream
(off her look)
Certain devils called incubi can
collect human semen and then
transfer it to women as they
sleep A woman who unwittingly
conceives in this manner would not
be a whore She would be
blameless in the eyes of God

Marguerites eyes spark suddenly hopeful

SOLOMON
You remember almost nothing of the
man who impregnated you Is it
not possible that there was no
man That the accused is not the
product of your own sin but the
foul offspring of a werewolf whose
semen was placed in you by an
incubus while you slept

MARGUERITE
Yes Yes I remember now He
came to me in my sleep It wasnt
my fault God save me it wasnt
my fault
Roxanne buries her face in her hands

INT MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY (LATER)
Solomon addresses the gathered Villagers

SOLOMON
We have proven here today that
behind this veil of feigned idiocy
is the fiend that has plagued your
village However in order for
the sentence of death to be
carried out the Church requires
either a confession or the
testimony of a witness who has
seen the accused in his
transformed state Since the
accused has refused to confess
this court calls upon its final
witness Isabelle Ordeville
Isabelle is stunned All eyes turn toward her
INT MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY (TIMECUT)

Isabelle stands before Solomon Claude waves She
ignores him

SOLOMON
On the night of the last full
moon you were attacked by the
Wolf You looked it in the eye
And the one thing a werewolf can
never change is its eyes

He gestures to the Soldiers They grab Claude and force
him to look at her

SOLOMON

Look into his eyes my child Do

you see the beast in them

sabelle gives Claude a pitying look Solomon watches
expectant Then

ISABELLE
t isnt him It cant be He
was with us when the Wolf
attacked
Solomon is taken aback Surprised MURMURS in the room

SOLOMON
Is this true Is there another
here who can speak to this

ROXANNE
I can Its true saw him

LUCRECE
Shes his sister Shell say
anything
The suspicious Villagers agree Roxanne gives Isabelle a
desperate look Then Isabelle spots the Carpenter

ISABELLE
He was there He carried Claude
away He saved his life
Suddenly all eyes are on the Carpenter He shrinks
back He glances at his WIFE She stares at him Hard

CARPENTER
She is mistaken I did no such
thing
Isabelle is shocked She looks to the other Villagers
but no one will speak up Solomon frowns

SOLOMON
Very well Since no one here can
bear witness we must extort a
confession This court shall
reconvene tomorrow at dawn
Solomon leaves Claude is dragged out of the room by
Soldiers Isabelle gives Grandmother a helpless look

INT ISABELLES FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DUSK

Isabelle and Grandmother sit at the table Cesaire is in
the other room feeding Suzette

ISABELLE
Why wouldnt Father Solomon listen
to me Doesnt he care that
Claude isnt guilty

GRANDMOTHER
Hed rather let an innocent boy
die than risk letting the Wolf go
free

ISABELLE
But the Wolf is free And the
moon will be full in two days
The full weight of this hits home Grandmother leans
close lowers her voice

GRANDMOTHER
We both know it will be coming for
you You must leave here tomorrow
and never return
A long beat Isabelle reluctantly shakes her head

ISABELLE
I cannot leave

GRANDMOTHER
You have no choice The
alternative is unthinkable

ISABELLE
What is unthinkable is that I
should be responsible for the
deaths of everyone that I love
Id rather spend a lifetime of
misery than let that happen

GRANDMOTHER
The Wolfs sins are on its own
twice-damned soul not yours

ISABELLE
But what if it was you it wanted
Would you go with it to save me
Or would you leave me to die
Grandmother doesnt have a fast answer for that
Suddenly a HIDEOUS INARTICULATE SCREAM echoes in the
night Isabelle and Grandmother exchange a grave look

EXT ISABELLES FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

Grandmother and Isabelle step outside followed by
Cesaire The SCREAMING can be heard more clearly

GRANDMOTHER
Father Solomon Extorting his
confession
Claudes screams sending chills down their spines

CESATIRE
You should have condemned him
today At least it would have
been quick
Cesaire turns and goes back inside Isabelle and
Grandmother continue to listen

INT ROXANNES FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

Roxanne weeps with her hands clamped around her ears
trying to block out the SCREAMING Her mother sits by
the fire as if nothing unusual is going on

ROXANNE
How can you just sit there and
listen to this
Marguerite ignores her Furious Roxanne stands up and
grabs Marguerites coin purse

MARGUERITE
Where are you going with that
Roxanne doesnt answer just pulls on her cloak
Marguerite grabs her but Roxanne turns and shoves her to
the ground Marguerite starts to get up but Roxanne
snatches a knife from off the table and points it at her

ROXANNE
Dont you touch me again Ever
Roxanne angrily throws the knife aside and leaves

INT MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON - NIGHT

A fire burns underneath a eBrazen BullU a hollow life-
size bull made of brass The fire heats the metal to
almost red-hot Claudes screams come from inside it

Solomon glowers frustrated Attewater looks sick

SOLOMON
Enough of this Lets eat
He gestures to the Scribe who hands Attewater a
document

ATTEWATER
What is this

SOLOMON
A statement declaring that you
heard the boy confess All it
requires is your signature Or
your mark if you cannot write

ATTEWATER
But he has not confessed How
could he have
Solomon studies Attewater A beat Solomon shrugs

SOLOMON
Very well Listen more carefully
this time
He gestures for the Soldiers to throw more wood on the
fire The FLAMES leap higher Attewater goes pale All
he hears are screams Solomon stands next to the bull
The flames gleam off the brass casting him in hellfire

SOLOMON
Listen to how he sings of his love
of Satan How he despairs that he
will never again copulate with the
dead or sink his teeth into the
flesh of pregnant women and eat
their unborn children
Attewater gives Solomon a horrified look suddenly
realizing Father Solomon is insane

ATTEWATER
Stop this

SOLOMON
No You stop it
(off his look)
We both know he is guilty But I
cannot legally execute him without
a witness or a confession Sign
this and we have a confession
Attewater glares at Solomon then angrily signs the
document Solomon gestures to his Soldiers who open the
bull and pull Claude out Attewater has to look away

Suddenly Solomon grabs Attewater by his collar drags
him across the room and forces him to look at Claude
Thankfully we do not see him except in deep fg His
naked flesh is actually smoking Attewater cringes

SOLOMON
This is the business of werewolf
hunting and you had best develop a
stomach for it Because where
there is one werewolf there are
two And where there are two
there are more

(BEAT)
This is only the beginning
Solomon throws him to the floor and leaves Attewater
trembles helplessly as Claude is dragged out of the room

INT MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT

Solomon is eating dinner The Captain enters

CAPTAIN
A girl to see you

SOLOMON
Well Ive yet to come across a
girl I wouldnt at least look at
The Captain ushers Roxanne inside She meekly steps
forward A beat

SOLOMON
I assume you came here with a
purpose
She hurriedly empties Marguerites purse on the table in
front of Solomon A mere handful of coins

ROXANNE
I would like to bargain for the
release of my brother

SOLOMON
Your brother has just confessed

ROXANNE
What Thats not possible

SOLOMON
It has been witnessed and
notarized He will hang in the
morning

Roxanne stands frozen gathering her courage for what she
is about to say Realizing that she has no choice

ROXANNE
I have more than money to offer
you
She raises a trembling hand and starts to open her
bodice but Solomon interrupts

SOLOMON
What do you think you are doing
(off her look)
Do you have any idea who I am I
am the Witchfinder General I
have fought in the Holy Land I
have waded hip deep in blood and
resisted all the temptations of
the infidels And you seek to
stay the hand of justice with such
a tawdry bribe Leave here girl
before I have you whipped
Solomon gestures for the Soldiers and they forcibly drag
her away Roxanne struggles against them

ROXANNE
Wait I have something else I
know the name of a witch

Solomon looks up sharply The Soldiers stop Solomon
crosses the room and stands glaring down at Roxanne She
cringes This is the hardest decision of her life

ROXANNE
Spare my brother and I will tell
you her name

Then A low MOAN in the dark Isabelle startles She
looks up her eyes going wide in disgust and horror
Its Claude Hes locked in a man-shaped cage his body
covered with hideous burns He moans again Isabelle
chokes back her disgust and goes to him She lightly
takes his hand shaken to her soul at the sight of him

INT MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY

The chamber is full again Cesaire Grandmother

Prudence and Henri are here Peter sits in the last

SOLOMON
How are you acquainted with the
accused
ROXANNE
We were friends

SOLOMON
And how long did this friendship
last

ROXANNE
All my life

SOLOMON

And in this time have you ever
known the accused to converse with
devils

ROXANNE
Yes Your Eminence On the night
of the last full moon she talked
to the werewolf And later she
told me that it also talked to
her
Isabelle gives Grandmother a frightened look Cesaire
clenches his fist Solomon turns to Isabelle

SOLOMON
What of this Do you deny having
conversed with a werewolf
She looks to Roxanne who trembles with emotion Then

ISABELLE
No I do not deny it
The crowd REACTS Solomon quiets them with a look

SOLOMON
Describe this encounter

ISABELLE
It spoke just as a man speaks

SOLOMON
And what was the nature of your
conversation with it
Isabelle hesitates Grandmother holds her breath

ISABELLE
It told me It promised to
leave here and never return But
only if I leave with it
Roxanne gives her a stunned look A heavy silence falls
over the room Even Solomon is surprised Then

REEVE
But who is it Make her tell us
who the werewolf is

ISABELLE
I dont know I swear I dont
know

MERCHANT

It doesnt matter who it is

anymore It wants her not us

Lets just give it what it wants

A long tense beat Heavy silence Nobody speaks

FATHER AUGUSTE
We should not allow ourselves to
even consider this

REEVE
I think we already are

GRANDMOTHER
Whats the matter with you You
know her You all know her

REEVE
Do we Did we know she could talk
to werewolves

GRANDMOTHER
She could have run away She
could saved herself but she
stayed here because she cares more
about you than she does herself

Peter reacts He and Isabelle exchange a look Now he
understands

MERCHANT
If she stayed she did so because
she is in league with it Let
this be her punishment
The crowd loudly AGREES Solomon considers Grandmother
gives Attewater a dark look Then

SOLOMON
Very well Isabelle Ordeville in
light of your willing confession
it is the decision of this court
that on the night of the next full
moon you be left to the mercy of
the werewolf
Cesaire silently buries his face in his hands

HENRI
No
Henri bursts to his feet turning heads Isabelle is led
away Roxanne can only watch helpless and ashamed

EXT VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY

Lucrece has drawn a small crowd around the well
Prudence pauses to hear what shes saying

LUCRECE
The first victim was her sister
The second was her fiancAOes
father Then Rosemaria who
everyone knows she hated And
dont forget her mother with half
her face missing All this death
around one girl
Prudence has heard enough She turns away

EXT MANOR HOUSE - DUSK

dangling from a makeshift gallows Hes been hanged

Roxanne falls to her knees The rope around Claudes
neck CREAKS as his body sways in the wind

INT MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON CELL - NIGHT

Isabelle stands at the barred door Grandmother is on
the other side They speak in furtive whispers

GRANDMOTHER
Im not going to let these
worthless shits sacrifice you to
save themselves We have to find
the real werewolf before tomorrow
night

ISABELLE
Thats impossible Even Father
Solomon doesnt have the first
clue

GRANDMOTHER
Father Solomon doesnt know the
things that I know
(off Isabelles look)
I am the oldest person in this
village who was here when the Wolf
first came I remember the old
days And what is happening now
is much worse

ISABELLE
What was it like in the old days
GRANDMOTHER
The Wolf never used to attack in
the open like it did at the
festival Its a coward at heart
It would kill whole families in
their homes but it always stayed
in the shadows It never would
have shown itself in the old days

ISABELLE
Its grown bold

GRANDMOTHER
Or perhaps it made a mistake

(BEAT)
Youre at the center of this At
least two of the victims can be
tied to you What if it had to
kill so many at the festival to
hide the fact that the first two
killings werent random

Isabelle considers this A beat as she realizes

ISABELLE
But who would want to kill Lucie

GRANDMOTHER
Your parents said that the Wolf
broke into the house and took
Lucie We both know thats not
true What really happened
Isabelle hesitates reluctant

ISABELLE
My mother made me swear I would
never speak of it
(BEAT)
Lucie went to the Wolf willingly
Grandmother reacts horrified

GRANDMOTHER
Why would you think such a thing

ISABELLE
She was in love with Henri

GRANDMOTHER
She took her own life over a boy

ISABELLE
What other explanation is there
Grandmother thinks The pieces are fitting together

EXT STABLE - NIGHT
Grandmother knocks on a door Henri answers

GRANDMOTHER
Hello Henri

INT STABLE - NIGHT

Henri is in the midst of shoeing a horse Grandmother
stands by the door watching him

GRANDMOTHER
You spoke up very loudly in
Isabelles defense today That

was very brave

HENRI
I just said what I felt

GRANDMOTHER
Youre under no obligation to
stand in her defense You broke
off your engagement to her

HENRI

I never stopped caring about her
I would do anything for Isabelle

GRANDMOTHER
As her sister would have done
anything for you
(off his look)
Lucie was in love with you But
you knew that didnt you

HENRI
I had no control over the way she
felt

GRANDMOTHER

She kept it secret from almost
everyone Even Isabelle didnt
know Did you tell anyone

HENRI
Never

GRANDMOTHER
Not even your father

HENRI
I didnt have to tell him

GRANDMOTHER
So he knew your secrets did he
Henri picks up a hammer and goes back to work Angrily
nailing a shoe to the horses foot BANG BANG BANG

GRANDMOTHER
You were the only one who could
have lured Lucie out on the Wolfs
night And none of the men who
went hunting for the Wolf remember
seeing you after the sun set on
the night your father died
Henri faces her clutching the hammer

HENRI
Why are you doing this

GRANDMOTHER
Because I want you to confess
You killed Lucie And your
father And God only knows how
many others And if you wont
admit it then I will tell Father
Solomon and we will lock you up
until the moon rises tomorrow
night and you can no longer hide
your guilt
As she says this a slow look of dawning realization
comes over him Realization and horror

HENRI
Its you
Henri steps closer to her menacing Grandmother steps
back and finds herself bumping against the closed door

HENRI
My God its you Youre the
Wolf I can smell it on you now

GRANDMOTHER
Smell what What are you talking
about

HENRI

The night my father died I saw
the Wolf pass by dragging him by
the neck I was so terrified I
couldnt move or make a sound I
remember every detail of that
moment The way the moonlight
gleamed off the Wolfs coat The
soundless way it moved I even
remember the way it smelled A
thick greasy musky stink

(BEAT)
And I can smell it on you right
now
A beat They stand frozen Glaring at one another

GRANDMOTHER
You accuse me and Ill bring you
down with me All they can do is
take my life You have more to
lose

HENRI
But who do you think theyll
believe Im the blacksmith

(MORE )

HENRI (CONTD)
They know me Youre the crazy
old woman who lives in the woods

GRANDMOTHER
Then Ill have to prove it

HENRI
Unless you can youd best keep
your mouth shut
Another beat A stand-off Grandmothers hand finds the
door handle She turns it stumbling outside --

EXT STABLE - NIGHT

-- and practically runs right into Cesaire She
startles gives him a surprised flustered look

CESAIRE
Are you ready for me to take you
home
She looks back Henri stands in the doorway still
holding the hammer She eyes him measuring suddenly
hesitant Cesaire gives them both an uncertain look

him and lets the faASade of calm fall from her face She
puts a trembling hand to her mouth mind racing

EXT GRANDMOTHERS COTTAGE - DAWN

Morning sunlight glints off the frozen brook A flock of
CROWS are startled from their roosts and take flight

INT GRANDMOTHERS COTTAGE - DAWN

Grandmother sits at the table writing a letter in Latin
with a quill She doesnt notice the veil that separates
her bedchamber rippling as if in a gentle breeze
Suddenly she hears MOVEMENT She looks up The veil is
still She stands and pokes the ashes of the fire with
her cane her back to the veil

and changes her grip on the cane To wield it as a
weapon Glancing back she sees the veil move again
Suddenly she whirls around and swings her cane at the
veil sweeping through it three times without hitting
anything A beat

GRANDMOTHER

Show yourself Coward
Another beat The veil settles and is still Then
A FIGURE lunges out of the veil with its arms reaching
out at us It grabs Grandmothers throat in one hand and
wrestles the cane from her grip with the other

She struggles but shes far too weak for her attacker
The Figure whips out a knife Grandmother sees it but
can do nothing The knife flashes

Fat drops of blood splash on the floor Then the Figure
drops Grandmother and she crumples lifeless A pool of
blood slowly spreads out from underneath her

The Figure steps over the widening pool and picks up the
letter Grandmother was writing He quickly scans it and
angrily tosses it in the fire
Then he hears something FOOTSTEPS crunching through
the snow He hurries to the window and peers out

ts Roxanne and Prudence Roxanne looks like hell but
here for lessons as usual The Figure ducks out of
sight A moment later theyre KNOCKING on the door
Their feet are visible under the crack

The Figure sidles alongside the door BREATHING heavily
Another KNOCK On the floor inside the pool of blood is
expanding toward the door

The Figure sees it He puts a hand on the hilt of his
nife then whispers to the girls through the door
disguising his voice with a dry old womans rasp

THE FIGURE
Go away
Outside Roxanne and Prudence exchange a curious look

PRUDENCE
Are you all right

THE FIGURE
Im sick You cant come in

PRUDENCE
You sound awful Would you like
us to make you something

THE FIGURE
No You mustnt come in Go
home now I want to sleep

The blood is flowing right toward the door In about
thirty seconds the girls will be standing in it
Outside Prudence and Roxanne exchange a look

then turn and walk away The Figure breathes a sigh
of relief and takes his hand away from the knife
But then Roxanne stops And looks back The Figure
secretly watches from the window
Roxanne walks back to the cottage The blood is about to
run under the door The Figure grabs the door handle and
readies the knife Roxanne stands on the doorstep

ROXANNE
Are you sure you dont want us to
bring you something

THE FIGURE
No my dear Come back tomorrow
The blood is seconds away from hitting her feet The
Figure stands poised to throw open the door but at the
last instant Roxanne turns and walks away She doesnt
see the blood pour outside under the door behind her

Henri and Isabelle take off through the village in the
cart but then they hear a HOWL behind them

They look back The Wolf emerges from the darkness
chasing after them Henri whips the horse urging it to
go faster They start to pull away from the Wolf but
then it veers off into the village and disappears

HENRI
Its gone

ISABELLE
I dont think so
Just then they pass by the Reeve and a group of
Villagers The Villagers start to give chase but
Isabelle and Henri quickly leave them behind

Meanwhile the Wolf is shortcutting through the village
racing after the cart It comes to a sheep pen and
smashes through it It comes to a large barn and leaps
onto its roof then leaps off again --

-- and lands within striking distance of the cart Henri
drives the horse but its no use The Wolf lunges
wrestling the horse to the ground The horse cries out
its body twisting as it falls sending the cart flying
Isabelle falls out and lands hard Henri lies on his
side clutching his wrist Isabelle pulls herself
together and goes to him She looks at his arm Its
visibly broken She helps him to his feet --

-- just as the overturned cart is SMASHED apart The
Wolf bursts through it breaking it to pieces It glares
at them with bloodthirsty eyes

Isabelle and Henri back away from it but their escape is
blocked -- the Villagers have caught up They freeze at
the sight of the Wolf but stand their ground Isabelle
and Henri are trapped The Reeve shouts

REEVE
Take her Take her and leave us
in peace
The Wolf SNARLS at him and turns to Isabelle

You cant outrun me my dear And
there is no place you can hide
that I cannot smell you out

So what is your decision Will
you take your place with me

Where do you belong then Here
With the cowards who so gladly
sacrificed you to save themselves

Theyre still good people

THE WOLF
They are sheep We are not like
them Let me show you what you
are
The Wolf steps closer but suddenly Henri pushes
Isabelle aside pulls his hammer from his belt and
raises it to hit the Wolf

HENRI
Get away from her
The Reeve quickly grabs him Henri struggles futilely
but Isabelle seizes the distraction She snatches a
Villagers torch and jabs it into the Wolfs side The
Wolf leaps back with an eerily human YELP of pain
Before it can react Isabelle waves the torch at the
Villagers grabs Henri and they run away
The mob chases after them Three Soldiers appear and
join the mob Figures silhouetted against the snow
angry faces lit by torchlight Its like a nightmare
Suddenly a cottage in front of the mob EXPLODES into
pieces and the Wolf bursts out of it It turns on the
Villagers and Soldiers It picks up a fallen roof beam
in its powerful jaws clenches them trembling with rage
and snaps the wooden beam in half like a twig
The Villagers run away in fear but the Soldiers stand
their ground and the Wolf attacks
Meanwhile Isabelle and Henri escape but there are
more Soldiers up ahead Isabelle and Henri quickly hide

HENRI

and runs down an alley The Wolf chases after her

As Isabelle nears the end of the alley the Wolf suddenly
appears in front of her blocking her path She races
back the way she came then darts into a gap between two
outbuildings barely big enough for her to pass through
too narrow for the Wolf to follow

But as she runs she hears a LOUD CLAMORING above her
The Wolf is chasing her on the roof of one of the
buildings Its right over her It shoves its head
through the narrow space above her SNAPPING its jaws
but cant quite reach her Then suddenly --

-- the gap between the buildings closes further and the
Wolf is stopped short choking its head caught in the
narrow space But Isabelle slips through emerges from
between the buildings and is startled by a VOICE

CAPTAIN (0S)
There
The Captain is pointing at her He has another Soldier
with him Isabelle runs They chase after her

just as the Wolf frees itself From the rooftop it
sees the Soldiers chasing Isabelle It races after them
running across roofs and jumping from cottage to cottage
Isabelle runs into an alley that dead-ends at a low wall
Theres firewood piled against the wall and Isabelle
quickly scrabbles up it but at the last second --

-- the Captain reaches out and grabs her ankle She
grabs a log and hits him over the head until he lets go
Then she jumps down to the other side

The other Soldier starts to climb after her but is
suddenly lifted right off his feet The Captain looks
up The Wolf is standing on the adjacent roof and has
picked the Soldier up in its jaws It glares down at the
Captain It flings the Soldier in its mouth away like a
dirty sock The Captain gapes up at it in fear for a
moment too long and then the Wolf is on him

EXT VILLAGE - SQUARE - NIGHT

Isabelles route has taken her right back to where she
started She spots the steeple and starts toward it
But there is someone here Father Solomon Hes holding
his silver sword Isabelle freezes For a moment they
just stand there looking at one another Then --
Isabelle turns to run Solomon is on her in an instant
He grabs a fistful of her hair and throws her to the
ground She tries to get away but he puts a knee in her
back and ties her hands together with a length of rope

SOLOMON
At least you wont die alone now
Your friends will all hang with

you
Suddenly a long hideous SNARL Behind them Father
Solomon turns Isabelle cranes her neck and sees the

Wolf emerge from the alley she just came out of Solomon
picks up his sword and stands to face it

SOLOMON
If you come for her you come
through me
The Wolf GROWLS and raises its hackles Solomon raises
his sword Just then Henri and Roxanne run into the
square followed by a group of Villagers
SOLOMON

Stay back
Henri hurries to Isabelles side The Villagers watch
breathless as Solomon and the Wolf circle one another
Solomons sword starts to tremble Sweat breaks out on
his brow The Wolf SNARLS with an almost mocking leer
Then with a loud battle cry Solomon charges The Wolf
leaps at him Solomon raises his sword

and the Wolfs jaws clamp onto his wrist Solomon
screams The Villagers watch horrified as the Wolf
twists back and forth like a dog with a chew toy --
-- biting off Solomons hand The hand falls into the
snow still clutching the silver sword Solomon cries
out in agony The Wolf turns toward Isabelle and SNARLS

THE WOLF
There is your mighty werewolf
hunter Who will save you now

Isabelle trembles The Wolf slowly steps toward her
menacing and is struck in the head with a rock The

Wolf stops surprised to find Henri standing in its way
Henri picks up another rock and throws it

HENRI
You bastard You killed my
father

ISABELLE

Henri what are you doing

HENRI
Im not letting it take you
He throws another rock and another One hits the Wolf in
the eye tearing a gash in its face The Wolf GROWLS

HENRI
Look It bleeds We can kill it
if we stand together
The Villagers waver Henri beseeches them

HENRI
Father Solomon was one man His
soldiers were mercenaries But we
are a village
The Wolf SNARLS at him but comes no closer

ISABELLE
Hes right Its a coward at
heart Look at it Why doesnt
it attack
The Wolf SNARLS louder and takes a step toward her but
then the Merchant picks up a rock and throws it

MERCHANT

You killed my daughter

Then another Villager joins them The Wolf looks around
Villagers are emerging from the shadows all around it
Its surrounded And not by a dozen soldiers but by a
solid wall of angry determined men and women

The Wolf raises its hackles trying to scare them but
they start closing in jabbing at it with weapons and
farm implements It snaps and SNARLS at its attackers
but there are too many of them

Someone drives a spear into the Wolf and it screams in
agony It lurches around biting at the spear but cant
reach it Then Henri sees something in the snow

Solomons sword He pries it out of Solomons severed
hand and turns to face the Wolf the angry Villagers
gathered behind them The Wolf trembles blood dripping
from its many wounds then it turns to Isabelle

THE WOLF
I will come for you again
And with that it turns and flees into the night The
Villagers CHEER The Reeve chases after it and the rest
of the angry mob follows him Henri turns to Isabelle
HENRI
Are you all right
Isabelle nods shaky Then

SOLOMON (0S)
This isnt over
They turn Solomon kneels holding his bloody stump

SOLOMON
I am bitten
Henri and Isabelle exchange a look A long beat Henri
walks over to Solomon sword in hand Solomon crosses
himself and closes his eyes unafraid Roxanne turns
away Isabelle doesnt
Then Henri swings the sword There is a soft THUMP as
Solomons head hits the snow Henri throws the sword
aside Isabelle puts a reassuring hand on his shoulder

Isabelle walks through the village wearing Lucies red
riding hood and carrying a basket of food People lower
their eyes as she passes She spots Prudence gossiping

The same pup we saw at the beginning is now a grown dog
It playfully follows Isabelle along the path but stops
as she enters the dark fog-shrouded forest

EXT DARK FOREST - PATH - DAY

Isabelle walks through the snow A thick fog gives the
forest a strange dream-like feeling A cold wind blows
Soon Isabelle becomes aware of FOOTSTEPS behind her She
stops and turns Slowly a figure appears Its Peter

PETER

He tries to take her hand but she pulls away A beat

ISABELLE

watching her go When she looks back hes gone She
sighs wiping tears from her eyes She continues on
Then FOOTSTEPS behind her again She stops and looks
back Listens Nothing She keeps walking But then
she HEARS them again Looks back A dark figure follows
her in the fog She walks faster
She reaches the fork in the path She pauses The
FOOTSTEPS are still behind her She makes a decision
She breaks off a tree branch and backs toward the
abandoned path using the branch to sweep away her tracks
in the snow When shes far enough away from the main
path she throws the branch aside

and turns to face the abandoned path It looks
ominous She gives it a wary look then starts walking

EXT GULLY - DAY

boards have fallen out during the winter Isabelle looks
down Its a long drop to the river below She edges
out stepping carefully on the snow-covered boards
holding onto the rope with both hands

the last instant she regains her balance The broken
board SPLASHES into the water She takes a moment to

catch her breath before continuing
