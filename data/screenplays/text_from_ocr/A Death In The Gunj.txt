EXT UNDISCLOSED LOCATION DUSK 1

An old blue Ambassador is parked in the middle of a stark
and barren landscape A shabby building stands at a distance
The camera is in the boot of the car and as the boot is
lifted we see Nandu and Brian silhouetted against
a bright afternoon sky Nandu has his hands on his hips and
Brian is peering into the boot They are both dressed in
unkempt winter clothes and look dishevelled

The camera is behind them now as Nandu and Brian awkwardly
struggle to hoist a dead body wrapped in a sheet into the
trunk It does not fit Nandu holds on to the feet that stick
out in an awkward position

BRIAN
(Holding onto the head)
Why don’t you bend the knees like
in a foetal position

They exchange a look They put the body in a foetal position
it fits They slam the boot shut On black we hear

BRIAN (0C) (CONTD)
Youre okay to drive

NANDU (0C)
Ya You got the papers right

BRIAN (0C)
Yup

The doors close and the ignition starts As the blue
ambassador drives away we see revealed the dilapidated sign
Ranchi Morgue against a stark landscape

We are on a wide lens on the side of the road Highway in the

car now quite dusty passes left to right

face and is wearing over-sized sunglasses with a scarf tied
under her chin Nandu and Bonnie’s daughter Tania Bakshi is asleep on her mother’s lap clutching an old rag doll

Their friend Mimi (Mitali Basu) is also in the back
seat Mimi is an abundantly sexy well turned out woman She
has a book open on her lap though they are all sleeping

Nandu sits in front driving His shirt sleeves rolled up and
a lit cigarette in one hand There are empty beer bottles
clinking on the floor of the car

Shutu sits in the front passenger seat He has a Rubik’s cube
in his hands though he is surreptitiously looking at MIMI’s
reflection in the rear view mirror

up in the cold sleeping at the back

is wearing a monkey cap and muffler Nandu slows the car down
and Maniya leans in

As the car pulls into the red graveled driveway of the house
Maniya shuts the gate behind them A couple of dogs run
behind the car and bark adding to the commotion

We see the house lit up by the headlights of the car there’s
no power

Nandu’s parents in their late sixties come out to the
verandah to greet them holding hurricanes They are blinded
by the beam of light from the car

Uncle is portly balding with a slight paunch Aunty looks
frail but sturdy She is wearing a sari with a sweater and a
shawl

Tani runs to her grandparents with her rag doll in hand
followed by Bonnie Mimi steps out with her vanity case in
hand Nandu throws the car keys to Shutu as he walks to the
verandah with a bag in hand

NANDU
Open the dicky for Maniya

Shutu catches the keys As he opens the boot he stands alone
and watches the family greet each other From his POV we see
the house for the first time It is a modest bungalow with a
circuit house feel

UNCLE (0C)

kitchen and watches Shutu taking out some desert With a
mischievous glint in his eye Vikram picks up an empty glass
from the side board and rolls it across the kitchen floor

touches Shutu’s feet he almost trips and drops the desert
bowl Vikram laughs loudly as he slaps Shutu on the back and

his tactics Vikram notices this and tries to ignore it but
when it is his turn to raid Brian’s team he becomes fiercely
competitive Vikram commits a minor foul against Shutu but
aggressively convinces others through sheer volume that he
isn’t in the wrong The mood of the game becomes very tense

the rifle ever so slightly Vikram is now in the direct line
of fire

Uncle turns back from Vikram to see that the rifle is no
longer aimed at him He takes a step forward

UNCLE

as Vikram is fast approaching him

Shutu feeling cornered removes the safety lock with
trembling fingers Uncle freezes Shutu puts his finger on
the trigger

UNCLE (CONTD)
Beta kya kar rahe ho

Bonnie hugs Tani to shield her from the scene

BONNIE
(desperately)
Shutu please

With one arm outstretched to reason with Shutu Vikram walks
slowly and deliberately towards him With his other hand
Vikram reaches for his own gun

VIKRAM
(In a steady voice)
Shutu put that gun down now

There’s a moment of fevered panic in Shutu’s eyes as Vikram
comes even closer to him Shutu grips the rifle tighter
aiming straight at Vikram

Vikram unafraid continues to approach Shutu

VIKRAM (CONTD)
You don’t need to do this Shutu

Shutu’s eyes well up He lowers his rifle The others start
to come closer

SHUTU
(Under his breath)
Sorry

There is a certain calm in his eyes now Suddenly with
lightening speed he turns the barrel to the base of his chin
and fires

Vikram freezes in shock as a few drops of blood splatter on
his face We hear Bonnie’s anguished cry Uncle rushes
towards the house

UNCLE
Shutu goli kha gaya Shutu goli kha

High Speed In the foreground a eucalyptus tree stands with
a fresh stain of blood as the smoke curls into the frame

Bonnie collapses with Tani on the grass Mimi covers her face
with both hands in shock Nandu holds his head in his hands
and falls to his knees Brian’s face is white as a sheet

In a low angle from Shutu’s POV Vikram rushes to the tree
Brian helps Nandu as he stumbles and falls Mimi stands
rooted to the spot in horror

We dissolve to the same shot at dusk as Bonnie Nandu Brian
Mimi and Vikram slowly disappear from the frame

A police siren is heard in the distance

CUT TO

INTEXT MCCLUSKIEGUNJ HOUSE INDETERMINATE HOUR 168

It is the same frame as in the previous shot only a little
darker A steady cam rises and languidly weaves it’s way into
the house starting from the verandah steps The house is
dimly lit We catch a glimpse of Uncle Vikram and Nandu at
the dinning table with a police officer who is taking notes
The rifle lies on the table

We pan from them to the mantle piece where the missing rifle
is marked by a dusty outline As we move to the next room
the lights die down It is night in their bedroom Uncle
sits still while Aunty lies awake next to him

As we move further through the door into Mimi’s room which is
empty the bed is unmade and her article remains incomplete
Moving further into the kitchen through the corridor light
changes to day We see Manjari working absentmindedly As we
move away early morning light fills the corridor Aunty
stares at her cup of tea sitting still

Day turns to night as we weave through the living room in
darkness and see Nandu sitting at a distance in the verandah
smoking a cigarette

At a crack of dawn we move into Bonnie’s room and see her
sitting in front of an open suitcase looking blankly ahead

We leave her as the camera travels through the bathroom as
daylight floods in a closed door opens into Shutu’s room
His backpack has been emptied of his clothes books and
toiletries as they lie strewn on the bed We stop at his desk
where his journal lies open A few pages flutter in the
breeze and peeking out from one of the pages is the envelope
addressed to his mother Mimi is standing at a window of
Shutu’s room smoking a cigarette looking out As the light
bleaches to white at the window

Outside the window we see Tani on the tyre swing As she
moves eerily in slow motion we pan to see scratched into the
tree trunk is Shutu’s name in childish writing Beneath it
in a more adult hand are his dates 1956 - 1979

The camera moves through the trees till it comes to the road
adjoining the orchard Nandu’s ambassador whizzes past

We are back to the present the opening sequence In a series
of long shots we see the same ambassador on a lonely stretch
of highway

EXT RANCHI HIGHWAY DUSK 170

Through the window of the driver’s seat we see Nandu in the
foreground in profile driving and smoking In the background
we see a grim Brian sitting in the front passenger seat with
a hanky to his mouth

Through the front windscreen we see Shutu wearing the same
clothes as the last time we saw him He sits in the middle in
the backseat looking worried scared and sad We move to an
extreme close up

INT RANCHI HIGHWAY NIGHT 170 A

They leave behind McCluskeigunj as we see dense forest
closing in behind the speeding car
