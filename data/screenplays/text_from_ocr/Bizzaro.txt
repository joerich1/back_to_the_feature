INT PENTAGON BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

A MILITARY ANALYST debriefs a panel of Military and
Government officials including the Secretary of State
National Security Advisor and various GENERALS and
ADMIRALS

ANALYST
Before we begin let me emphasize
that there was only one living
witness to The Event and that
witness was only a boy at the
time My department has done its
best to connect the dots but Id
still caution you to take
everything I present with a
measure of cynicism

ADMIRAL CARTWRIGHT
But the big guy was there

ANALYST
Yes but he refuses to discuss it

ADMIRAL CARTWRIGHT
Why

ANALYST
Perhaps youd like to interrogate
him on that subject Admiral

The Admiral looks down No he wouldn’t

ANALYST (CONTD)
Here’s what we have gathered
Professor Maze Dalton was working
in his makeshift laboratory on a
device intended originally to
replicate foodstuffs for
impoverished nations The device
was yielding unexpected
results

INT MAZE DALTON’S GARAGE LABORATORY - DAY

A SCIENTIST (MAZE DALTON) operates a control which
rotates a complex TELESCOPING APPARATUS An AIMING LASER
is beamed from the front The beam comes to rest on a
large DIAMOND clamped to a pedestal

The scientist makes a notation then reaches to pull a
HIGH VOLTAGE ELECTRICAL LEVER

( )

Just then his son SPENCER a toddler wanders in the path
of the beam idly picking his nose

PANICKED the Scientist YANKS the switch upward before the
device fires

SCIENTIST
Spencer Get away from there
What did I tell you

SPENCER
Sorry I had to go to the bathroom
but I don’t anymore

The Scientist takes his son by the hand and sets him on a
tall lab chair

SCIENTIST
I told you stay in the chair or
you have to go in the house Ok

Spencer nods The scientist goes back to the lever and
PULLS it A purple BEAM shoots from the device into the
diamond which GLOWS and VIBRATES He turns to Spencer

SCIENTIST (CONTD)
What’s your guess

SPENCER
Hmmm A diamond would be maybe
something to eat Soft maybe
Like gum

SCIENTIST
Hmm Let’s see

The Scientist and Spencer lean forward to see

The Diamond VIBRATE furiously until TWO OBJECTS appear in
its place and CLATTER into the dish below We see that
now in addition to the original diamond a WALNUT rolls
in the dish

BOY
A walnut Well I was part right

The scientist throws him the walnut Spencer cracks it
on the table and eats it

BOY (CONTD)

It’s not a very good duplicator
is it Dad

SCIENTIST
No but it’s an excellent
something

Spencer swings his legs bored as the scientist
scribbles this result in his notebook

BOY
What’s next

The scientist looks at a cage containing a hamster A
label identifies him as “Sammy”

BOY (CONT’D)
Oh no Not Sammy

SCIENTIST
(completely deadpan)
He’s a scientist son He wants
this as much as we do

Spencer looks dubious but hey you can’t stop a hamster
scientist Then he turns his attention drawn to
something out the window

BOY
What’s that in the sky It’s not a
bird I don’t think
He tips his chair back to get a better look

BOY (CONT’D)
A plane maybe

The chair’s front legs tip off the floor
OUT THE WINDOW

We see a STREAK of light in the sky coming toward us A
figure in red and blue

ANALYST (VO)
At that moment he was travelling
to stop a railroad collision in
Munich Every indication is that
the incident was just a freak
accident

INT GARAGE

The Scientist focuses the beam on the hamster Restless
Spencer leans back to get a better look out the window

The legs on the stool TILT precariously off the ground
just as

The SCIENTIST pulls the SWITCH The beam SHOOTS FORWARD
onto the hamster Suddenly the scientist turns as

SCREECH The legs SLIDE out from under Spencer He tips
backwards head first toward the hard floor

The Scientist DIVES for him catching Spencer before
impact but his coat CATCHES on the DEVICE and it SWINGS
SKYWARD

IN THE SKY

SUPERMAN (distant angle) SOARS RIGHT INTO THE BEAM and
TUMBLES BLINDED AND DISORIENTED

INT GARAGE

As the Scientist runs to steady the beam Spencer runs to
the window and looks up (NOTE Throughout the following
we never see Superman in full just a boot a piece of a
cape a blue and red speck in the distance)

SPENCER
It hit Superman

SCIENTIST
WHAT Oh no

He runs to the window

SPENCER’S POV

We’re so far away we cannot make out details Superman
is simply a glowing speck in the sky But then we
notice Another speck peeling from his body A fiqure
falling to earth

SPENCER
Uh oh It made another one

The figure falls grasping at the sky like a bird being
born mid-flight that hasn’t learned how to fly Then

CRASH It plunges straight into the house like an anvil
Behind the garage door - from inside the house- we hear
RUSTLING Whatever fell Is alive

SCIENTIST
Wait here

The scientist opens the door leading into the house
closing the door behind him

SPENCER
Dad no

We hear a ROAR then a SCREAM then a sound of a STRUGGLE
as Spencer watches the door Then silence

SPENCER (CONTD)
Dad Dad

Suddenly the door SPLINTERS A FIGURE stands silhouetted
in the doorway Something HUGE and MISSHAPEN and ANGRY

SPENCER (CONT’D)
SUPERMAN HELP SUPERMAN

The figure moves forward from the shadows Now we see he
wears the familiar blue tights a red cape hangs off his
shoulders MISSHAPEN MONSTROUS WILD-EYED A backwards
“S” on his chest Meet BIZARRO

BIZARRO
Me am Superman

SPENCER
(to the sky)
SUPERMAN 1

BIZARRO

He follows Spencer’s look up to Superman in the sky then
LAUNCHES upward on a interception course

BOARDROOM

GENERAL
“Me am Superman”

ANALYST
Yes sir That’s what it said sir
(reading)
“Me am Superman” We believe the
duplication gave the creature
fragments of Superman’s actual
memories

MURMURING from the table

ANALYST (CONTD)
After that details are sketchy
The sight of the monster the
death of his father The boy has
no memory of the events past this
point This is what we were able
to piece together

We see projected a grainy telescopic view of A BATTLE
BETWEEN SUPERMAN AND BIZARRO (Again Superman is never
fully seen and is always partially obscured by Bizarro
and the objects between them) Bizarro HURLS himself
straight into Superman who is thrown back through the
atmosphere into space

ANALYST (CONTD)
The fight went into space these
are from various sources Hubble
amateur photography As you can
see the battle was extremely
fierce The duplicate seemed to
have all of Superman’s strength
if not his finesse

VARIOUS PHOTOS of the battle are passed around They
look almost like grainy action scenes from the comics
Superman and the Beast wage superhuman battle in the
cosmos tossing asteroids at each other chasing through
the rings of Saturn hurling each other into the moon

GENERAL
Why Why did he go after
Superman

ANALYST

What if someone walked in here
right now insisting he was YOU
General In this creature’s mind
Superman was an imposter a liar
a threat Plus let’s remember
(beat)
That device turned a diamond into
a walnut

We PAN UP to the screen where we see grainy footage of a
figure dropping limp back through the atmosphere It’s
Bizarro defeated and falling back to earth Immediately
afterward a HUGE METEOR appears falling through the
atmosphere directly above Bizarros lifeless body

ANALYST (CONTD)
Ok so here after Superman
defeated him the monster fell
back to earth The Aegean Sea to
be specific

SECRETARY OF STATE
Whats that above him

ANALYST
A meteor Mr Secretary

Bizarro HITS the water

CUT TO

UNDERWATER

No more grainy footage from this point on This is the
real thing Poor Bizarro SINKS down down down into the
sea Right above him THE HUGE ROUND METEOR hits the
water and sinks slowly down directly above him

SECRETARY OF STATE
Why throw a meteor on top of him
if he was already dead

ANALYST
We believe Superman simply desired
to give him a proper burial

Finally Bizarro comes to rest at the bottom of the ocean
His eyes are sad and resigned he almost looks conscious
We see the giant sphere above him from his POV as it
grows closer and closer and larger and larger

WHOOMP The meteor comes to rest on top of him sinking
a ways into the ocean floor

ANALYST (VO) (CONTD)

And that gentlemen closes the file
on event 837-AC-91

TITLE CARD 10 YEARS LATER

INT PERRY WHITE’S OFFICE - THE DATLY PLANET
A NEWSPAPER is thrown on the desk The headline reads

“PICKPOCKET ARRESTED” There’s a photo of the culprit
looking ashamed (Dean I present your cameo)

A bottle of scotch and a glass is set on the paper A
drink is poured We pull back to reveal

PERRY WHITE at his desk He looks miserable

PERRY WHITE
I’ve been around a long time
I’ve reported on wars natural
disasters super-villains mass
murderers I mean I’ve been
blessed So what did I do to
deserve this “PICKPOCKET
ARRESTED” on the front page How
did the world come to this

We cut to the two figures he’s talking to LOIS LANE and
JIMMY OLSEN

JIMMY OLSEN
Chief Superman took care of
everything before he left All
the major criminals are in jail
he fixed up the infrastructure
world affairs put those laser
sentries around the seaports He
did a ton of work before he left
so we’d be in good shape for a
while

As he speaks we see a quick montage of the improvements
Jimmy describes
EXT METROPOLIS - JAIL

A cell door slams on grimacing CRIMINALS

EXT BRIDGE

A ribbon is cut on a gleaming new bridge spanning the
river and traffic begins to cross

EXT SEAPORT - NAVAL BASE

A seagull flies a little too close to the naval base and
dozens of LASER SENTRIES telescope up from the ground and

target him with dots The seagull caws and flies away

Back to SCENE

JIMMY OLSEN
-Everythings great Mr White
Isnt that a good thing

PERRY WHITE
Not for a newspaper it’s not
Lois you’re uncharacteristically
quiet Why

LOIS
Because I’m losing my mind

PERRY WHITE
There Olsen see Now THAT’S a
news man

JIMMY OLSEN
Oh she’s got other problems Her
boyfriend Clark is overseas and I
think she’s just really super horn-

Lois shoots him a ‘don’t you dare’ look

She SNAPS

JIMMY OLSEN (CONTD)
Tense A little tense

LOIS

(build to hysteria)
I can deal with the human interest
stories Biggest rubber band
ball Fine Puppy dials 911
Great I hold my nose I type
What I can’t take is everyone
screaming “we need Superman
where’s Superman” every time they
stub their toe I mean he’s off
re-forming a galaxy that’s
spiraling into a black hole
trillions of lives at stake and
the first time someone loses a cat
up a tree they’re angry at
Superman for leaving them This
selfish city doesn’t DESERVE
Superman

her pencil
JIMMY OLSEN

I’m just saying maybe a foot
massage or something

Beat Suddenly a JUNIOR REPORTER runs in the room out of

breath

JUNIOR REPORTER
Mr White A school bus full of
children is teetering off of the
North Street bridge

LOIS AND PERRY WHITE AND JIMMY
Great Fantastic Thank God

EXT NORTH STREET BRIDGE - DAY

Lois and Jimmy Olsen exit their car and push through the
crowd

LOIS
Youve got film right

JIMMY OLSEN
I’ll pretend you didn’t ask that

LOIS
Jimmy the way things are going
this is the story of the decade I
just want to make sure we get it
(pushing into crowd)
PRESS CLEAR THE WAY

Lois and Jimmy push through the crowd to see
THE BUS
It’s actually not teetering Just the front wheel is
hanging over the side and it’s in no danger whatsoever
of tipping Loiss face falls disappointed
LOIS (CONTD)
That’s it That’s not

“teetering”

She walks up to the bus Inside the kids are hysterical

KIDS
SUPERMAN HELP US
AAAAGHHH SUPERMAN SAVE US

LOIS
Youre not teetering This isnt
TEETERING Just walk off the bus

SCHOOL BUS DRIVER
WE’RE GOING TO DIE SUPERMAN

LOIS
You don’t need SUPERMAN Theres
the door JUST WALK OFF THE BUS

The kids keep yelling

LOIS (CONTD)
That’s it I’ve had it You want
TEETERING OKAY ILL GIVE YOU
TEETERING

She moves to the back of the bus and starts to PUSH

JIMMY OLSEN
Uh Lois What are you doing

LOIS
I’m getting the story

JIMMY OLSEN
Um Yeah uh You’re trying to
push a bus load of kids off a
bridge Just um FYI

Lois stops realizes what she’s doing straightens her
skirt regains her poise

LOIS
I think maybe I should take a day
or two off

JIMMY OLSEN
You think

EXT BEACH - DAY

Lois in her swimsuit lies flat on her back on the sand
completely miserable Her feet tap together her fingers
tap the sand It doesn’t look like the vacation is
helping a bit

A RIDICULOUSLY TAN GUY in a Speedo next to her keeps
glancing over And at the risk of stating the obvious
Lois is extremely attractive in her swimsuit Tan Guy is
getting ready to make his move when Lois speaks to him
first

LOIS
Tell me What do you get out of
this Just laying here

TAN MAN
It’s relaxing Nothing going on
Just zone out your brain

LOIS
And that’s appealing to you
That’s something you get enjoyment
from Having NOTHING going on in
your head

TAN MAN
(oblivious )
We seem to be clicking We should
have dinner and see where it goes
Lois ignores this and looks out to sea She sees
OUT AT SEA
A small fishing boat on the horizon

BACK TO LOIS

She crinkles her nose Something strikes her odd about
the boat She reaches for her cell and dials a number

CUT TO

POV THROUGH BINOCULARS

A closer view of the small weathered FISHING BOAT A
half dozen CREWMEN flank the deck A GOATEED MAN the
captain scans the horizon

EXT JIMMY OLSEN’S SPEEDBOAT

Lois is holding the binoculars as she and Jimmy speed
across the ocean in a pristine and powerful watercraft
Jimmy shouts over the engine

LOIS
No nets Why would a fishing
boat head out to sea without nets

JIMMY OLSEN
Lois Ive got to get this back to
the consumer section by three
oclock

LOIS
(ignoring him)
And look at the wake Its huge
Isnt it huge for a fishing boat

JIMMY OLSEN
Youre not great with vacations
are you

EXT FISHING BOAT

Now on-board the fishing boat we get a closer look at the
Captain His perfectly manicured goatee and regal
demeanor are completely out of place for a fishing boat
captain This is because he is in reality GENERAL ZOD
the Kryptonian supervillain turned mortal by Superman in
Superman II He turns to his “first mate” a woman with
short dark hair beautiful severe looking This is
URSA his sadistic slash incredibly sexy cohort

ZOD
How much further

She types into a custom made blackberry-type device
receives a response

URSA
Navigation estimates fifteen
hundred kilometers

Two CHINESE MEN approach They’re dressed as fishermen as
well but their rings and expensive glasses clearly
betray their disguise They are all business their
English slightly stiff We’ll call them Financiers 1 and 2

FINANCIER 1
Is there a signal

ZOD
Not yet

FINANCIER 1
We should have had a signal by
now

FINANCIER 2
Another wild goose chase

ZOD
Patience gentlemen patience

FINANCIER 2
Our patience is at an end We are
terminating the search

Ursa TURNS her eyes burning Zod holds her back

ZOD
We’1ll continue the search as
planned

FINANCIER 2
Don’t you understand There are
no more funds We are turning
back And you will pay for
leading us to ruin with your
promises

The Financiers draw guns and nod to THREE THUGS behind
them who also draw guns Zod sighs what an annoyance

Then suddenly-- A SOFT PING-PING-PING signal sounds from
the device in Ursas hands

URSA
They’ve found it One hundred
kilometers

FINANCIER 1
Let me see

She tilts the BlackBerrys screen his way without even
acknowledging him Financier 1 lets down his guard
lowers his gun and laughs relieved Then the others
follow suit

ZOD
You heard them Ursa The money
has run dry We can terminate the
relationship

URSA
Yes General Zod

Zod turns and starts to walk away leaving Ursa with the
men The Businessmen are still laughing celebrating

FINANCIER 1
What did he say

FINANCIER 2
“General Zod” Who is Zod Why
did you call Doug Smith by the
name of--- AGGGHHHH

He screams because Ursa has snapped his spine with her
knee Were still on Zod’s face tracking with him as he
continues forward to the center of the boat and can only
see bits and pieces of the carnage behind him as Ursa
snaps necks and cracks bones leaving the five
businessmen’s bodies in a pile in the background

We follow Zod as he climbs a hatch below deck revealing

INT FISHING BOAT INTERIOR

AN IMPOSSIBLY VAST HIGH TECH OPERATIONS CHAMBER DOZENS
OF TECHNICIANS AND SEAMEN scurry about

ZOD
Double our speed I want to be at
the site within the hour

We PULL UP UP above the boat - high enough to see THE
SHIMMERING OUTLINE OF THE ENORMOUS VESSEL BELOW just
beneath the surface The FISHING BOAT is merely the tip
of the iceberg

EXT JIMMY OLSEN’S BOAT

The boat is practically hydroplaning to keep up with the
fishing boat

LOIS
It’s just a fishing boat How can
they be going this fast

JIMMY OLSEN
I don’t know but we go any
further we’re not going to have
gas to get back

Lois holds up her binoculars The fishing boat is no
longer visible

LOIS
All right Turn it around

Jimmy turns the boat around back toward land Lois looks
behind her still puzzled
EXT FAR BENEATH THE SEA - LATER

A cylindrical CANNISTER is lowered on a shimmering purple
cable

We follow it down as it passes through a school of fish
past DIVERS holding underwater flares and finally is
caught by two divers sitting on a large round surface at
the bottom of the ocean As the divers unhook the
cannister from its line we PULL BACK to reveal

THE HUGE METEORITE now covered by barnacles and undersea
plant life A dozen DIVERS surround the rock three of
them using a huge DRILL to bore a hole in the side of the
meteorite

We pan down to TWO MORE DIVERS who are digging a tunnel
underneath the meteorite We follow one of the divers
INSIDE the cramped tunnel where he uses a vacuum to draw
out dirt scooping more out with his hands

Suddenly he feels something through the dirt
TUNNELING DIVER
I found something Wait I
think

He uses the vacuum and brushes the dirt revealing
BIZARRO’S LARGE FOOT

TUNNELING DIVER (CONT’D)
It’s a foot

DIVER LEADER
Copy did you say FOOT
INT EXPLORATION SHIP
Back in the main vessel Zod turns to Ursa and smiles
ZOD
Attach the mercurite line to the
ankle
DIVER LEADER
I thought we were looking for
treasure Zod
ZOD
And we’ve found it Team 2 have
you mounted the explosive

UNDERWATER AT THE METEOR

The divers have inserted the cannister into the hole
bored into the meteor’s side

DEMOLITION DIVER 1
We’re there

ZOD
Go ahead and initiate We have
more than enough time on the
countdown

The demolition TECH triggers the switch a steady beep
beep beep sounds the countdown

DIVER LEADER
Wait I don’t get this Zod Any
explosive big enough to rip apart
this rock is going to incinerate
whoever’s attached to this foot

ZOD
Let me worry about that

DIVER LEADER
I’‘1l give you something else to
worry about No explosive that
size is going to do a thing to
this rock I tried to tell you
You’d need a nuke to blow this
thing apart

ZOD
Which is why I brought a nuke

The Divers all exchange glances What the hell

DIVER LEADER
Are you insane All crews pack
it up now Zod how much time
do we have extricate the team

ZOD
About Twenty five seconds

DIVER LEADER
You said we had plenty of time

ZOD
I said “we” had plenty of time

DIVER LEADER
Why Zod Why

ZOD
Because you know my name

ON THE DECK

Zod nods to Ursa who triggers a switch We hear MACHINERY
gearing up as Ursa joins him on a small platform in the
center of the boat Then with a loud ENGINE SOUND

The “fishing boat” opens up right down the middle like a
giant hatch and a HELICOPTER is revealed rising on a
hydraulic pad
UNDERWATER

DIVER LEADER

Everyone out Everyone out You
Davis WHY AREN’T YOU MOVING

With empty eyes Davis simply looks up from the nuke timer
which reads 432 and shakes his head “what’s the
use” as

BOOM a blinding FLASH obliterates all

EXT OCEAN

Jimmys boat is within sight of the shore Lois and
Jimmy JUMP at the sound of THE DISTANT EXPLOSION

JIMMY OLSEN
WHAT THE HELL

They turn to see far far in the distance

A small MUSHROOM CLOUD rising from the center of the
ocean

JIMMY OLSEN (CONTD)
Think it’s some kind of test

LOIS
(concerned)
There’s going to be a wave

JIMMY OLSEN
What

LOIS
There’s going to be a BIG WAVE

She looks through her binoculars The WAVE generated

from the blast RISES on the horizon and is moving toward
them FAST

JIMMY OLSEN
We gotta try to get to shore

She looks back to shore

LOIS
No its too far Go that way

She motions TOWARD the wave

JIMMY OLSEN
THAT way The WAVE way

LOIS
It’s still a swell If we can get
to it before it starts to crest
well go right over it

JIMMY OLSEN
How do you know

LOIS
I went boogie boarding as a kid
Come on Floor it

She helps spin the wheel and they head TOWARD THE WALL OF

WATER

JIMMY OLSEN
This isnt right This isnt
right

Lois takes out a small dictation recorder as the boat
ROARS TOWARD THE WAVE

LOIS
Okay Perry heres the story
There was a blast perhaps nuclear
that preceded the wave There was
a suspicious fishing boat with the
marking Lazarus on the side

JIMMY OLSEN
What are you doing

LOIS
In case we dont make it

JIMMY OLSEN
I thought you went BOOGIE
BOARDING

LOIS
Oh my god

Fe

The wave begins to CREST She STEPS on his foot pushing
the accelerator VROOOM

WIDER ANGLE

The speedboat is a TINY DOT climbing up the wall of
water And yet it seems possible that they could
possibly survive as long as the water doesn’t start to
curl back on them

LOIS (CONT’D)
Come on Come on FASTER
Don’t curl Don’t curl

THEIR POV

The water STARTS to curl over Jimmy closes his eyes
his head low on the wheel bracing himself as they HEAD
INTO THE CURL AT THE TOP

JIMMY OLSEN
It’s CURLING

They PUNCH through the top the speedboat goes FLYING
straight up into air twenty feet

JIMMY OLSEN (CONTD)

SUPERMAN HELP US SUPERMAN

Then the boat turns nose down and FALLS catching the
BACK of the swell and gently gliding down the back of
the enormous wave

They watch as the wave CRASHES to shore thankfully short
of the city proper

It’s quiet Lois turns to Jimmy as they bob in the
water

JIMMY OLSEN
You said

LOIS
(a little too fast)
What I didnt say anything

INT HELICOPTER

Ursa pilots the helicopter Zod looks out the window a
peaceful smile on his face

ZOD
Soon Ursa we will have our
powers again And then

URSA
And then my General

She smiles a sickly sadistic smile that is more chilling
than anything she could put into worlds Except maybe

URSA (CONTD)
I love these humans General They
have nerve endings everywhere

Zod smiles gazing down out of the helicopter looking
down the length of the cable spooled from the hydraulic
wench
ZOD

He thought of everything before he

left Everything but you you

poor wretched thing
We PULL BACK to see
BIZARRO hanging by his ankle ten feet below at the other
end of the cable as the helicopter swoops a wide turn
away from the water and flies inland

CUT TO

BLACK

FADE IN

BIZARRO’S DREAM — POV

We see DREAMY FRAGMENTS OF SUPERMANS MEMORIES as SEEN
THROUGH BIZARRO’S DREAMS They’re all in FIRST PERSON
POV we never see Superman himself

POV WE’RE RUNNING THROUGH A CORNFIELD ALONGSIDE A
TRAIN A kid in the train spots us and his eyes go wide
We wave at the boy

POV WE’RE FLYING TOWARD A CRIPPLED AIRLINER its engine
on fire We fly under the wing to stabilize it The
PILOT looks at us surprised and relieved Gives us a
“thumbs up”

POV WE’RE PLAYING WITH SUPERDOG KRYPTO - tug of war with
a heavy CHAIN The dog’s red cape flaps behind him his
tail wags

Everyone loves us
WE TRANSITION OUT TO BIZARRO’S SLEEPING FACE

He smiles relishing his dreamy memories of heroism and
appreciation and companionship

ZOD (OS)
All right try again Heartbeat

URSA (0S)
Still one per hour General

ZOD (0S)
Try five hundred million volts
That should do the trick

Darkness then VOLTAGE Blue streaks of lightning
paint the frame We’re seeing what Bizarro sees through
his closed eyelids as he’s ELECTROCUTED to
consciousness A GASP WeBizarro open our eyes to see
General Zod smiling at us

INT ZOD’S COMPOUND
WE PULL OUT TO A WIDER ANGLE OF THE ROOM

ZOD
Ah there we are Good morning

It’s a modern gleaming version of Frankensteins
laboratory A CYCLOTRON generates electricity through
giant CABLES hooked to Bizarro’s body strapped to the
table Giant MONITORS on the walls display data and 3-d
imaging of Bizarro

Bizarro looks around dazed and bewildered Defensively
he STANDS but gets weak in the knees and FALLS

ZOD (CONTD)
(gentle)
It’s all right that’s to be
expected my friend You’ve been
asleep a very long time

He offers his hand to help him up but Bizarro looks up
at him suspiciously and rises slowly on his own

ZOD (CONTD)
Can you understand me Can you
speak

Bizarro moves across the room holding on to objects to
steady himself He arrives at the lab sink breathing
heavily

ZOD (CONTD)
If you can understand what I’m
saying then hold up your hand

Bizarro leans over the sink and unceremoniously VOMITS
about thirty whole FISH most still flopping about Then
he sits in the chair looking around dazed

BIZARRO
(soft)
Me am feel normal

ZOD
Ah he speaks What did he say

URSA
I think he said he feels normal

ZOD
(puzzled)
I don’t understand

Bizarro looks around confused and agitated

BIZARRO
Me am know exactly where I am
ZOD
You do How would you You’ve
been---
BIZARRO

ME AM KNOW EXACTLY WHERE I AM ME
AM KNOW WHO YOU ARE OR YOU

Ursa reads from her stolen copy of the CLASSIFIED
GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT seen earlier

URSA

(reading monotone)
“We speculate that the duplication
process would similarly introduce
a form of cellular dyslexia in any
living creature causing
inconsistent reversal of some
thought processes such as speech
logic etc”

ZOD
Ah I see So what you’re saying
is you feel strange and you
don’t know where you are and you
don’t know who WE are

Bizarro stares at him like he’s an idiot OBVIOUSLY

ZOD (CONTD)
Humor me I’m a bit slow My
name is Zod I rescued you This
is my home This is Ursa

Bizarro stands looks around

BIZARRO
Why Zod put me in the ocean

ZOD
I didn’t put---
(catches himself)
Right I brought you OUT of the
ocean because---

He turns to Ursa

ZOD (CONTD)
When I say something forwards he
doesn’t reverse it in his head

URSA
(shrugs )
Apparently not

He turns back to Bizarro

ZOD
I rescued you because I feel a
kinship to you You see we’ve both
been victims of that imposter
Superman

BIZARRO
Me am Superman

ZOD
Correct You’re not Superman
your name is “Bizarro” Youre

very much LIKE Superman however-

BIZARRO
Meam SUPERMAN

He grabs the thick steel examination table and ACCORDIONS
it into the wall next to Zod’s head then leans in like
an angry bear Zod maintains his cool

URSA
I don’t think he was saying the
opposite that time

ZOD
I believe you may be right

He turns back to Bizarro
ZOD (CONTD)
Well Superman I apologize The
important thing is you’re here
now and tomorrow will be a
historic day because tomorrow---

Bizarro has stopped listening He turns abruptly and
heads towards the exit

ZOD (CONTD)
Wait where are you going

BIZARRO
Me am go destroy world

ZOD
What

Bizarro KNOCKS DOWN the heavy metal door and exits

INT HALLWAY

Ursa and Zod chase after juggernaut Bizarro as he strides
down the hallway knocking aside everything in his path

ZOD
Wait Stop let me speak to you
for a moment

Bizarro plows straight ahead

BIZARRO
Me am Superman Me am destroy the
world

Zod turns to Ursa

ZOD
He wants to save the world
correct

URSA
Your guess is as good as mine

Bizarro plows through the wall at the end of the hall

EXT ZOD’S COMPOUND
Bizarro walks a distance from the main building

ZOD
Listen Superman of course you
want to save the world that’s
what you do but you’re not ready
yet They will try to hurt you out
there

BIZARRO
Nobody can not hurt Superman

ZOD
I saved your life

BIZARRO
You’re welcome

Bizarro crouches preparing to fly

ZOD
(losing his temper)
I forbid this

He grabs Bizarro’s wrist Oops thats a mistake

Bizarro turns slowly with a frown and Zod - realizing
that Bizarro could tear his arm from his body like pulled
pork - lets go

ZOD (CONTD)
I’m the only friend you have in
this world Remember that

Bizarro raises his gaze skyward

BIZARRO

LOIS
The blast destroyed all traces of
the boat so there’s no forensics
possible The nuke was
approximately 300 kiloton
tactical maybe old Soviet but
there are hundreds of those
floating around no way to trace
it

PERRY WHITE
Why would you detonate a nuke in
the middle of the ocean It
doesn’t make sense

JIMMY OLSEN
Hey Hey look at this

They move to Jimmy at his computer He’s got Google

Earth up

JIMMY OLSEN (CONTD)
Satellite snapped this about
thirty minutes after the
explosion about sixty miles
East

If you squint you can make out a tiny image of Zod’s

helicopter

LOIS
Looks like an Ospry But we
checked no military out there

PERRY WHITE

PERRY WHITE
Zoom in further

JIMMY OLSEN

Perry grimaces at the giant unfocused BLOB on the screen
then at Jimmy accusingly Jimmy looks sheepish Like
its HIS fault

LOIS
Hey Jimmy it was late
afternoon Let’s see if there’s

a shadow Drag down

Jimmy and Perry exchange impressed glances Lois is on
her game

JIMMY OLSEN

EXT THE SKY

BIZARRO flies over the desert scanning the landscape
below He flies like a tank awkward and graceless But
we can feel the weight the wind and the effort of
flying It’s not silly at all it’s pretty cool

Suddenly his super-hearing picks up a voice It’s a
little girl’s cry

LITTLE GIRL’S VOICE (0S)
Help somebody help me He’s
going to kill me

Bizarro spots the source of the call for help and DIVES

EXT BACKYARD

On a sprawling yard in a dusty desert neighborhood a
LITTLE GIRL screams

LITTLE GIRL
Help Help me

We pull back to see that she is just playing with her
BROTHER who’s dressed like a pirate The girl is “tied”
to a tree by a dangling single rope

BROTHER PIRATE
Nobody will help you now Now

LITTLE GIRL’S VOICE
But what you don’t know is I’ma
pirate too Arrrgh

She lets the rope drop to her feet and steps forward

BOTH OF THEM
Arrgh Arghhh

They draw plastic swords the brother moves toward her
and suddenly

WHOOMP BIZARRO LANDS HARD right in front of the boy
The ground CRACKS at his feet

The boy STARES up at the monster paralyzed with HORROR

Bizarro GRABS his arm and SQUEEZES The sword drops
The boy CRIES OUT in pain

BIZARRO
You am not want hurt little
girl Maybe you am not hurt

Suddenly a SHOTGUN BLAST sounds and Bizarro turns He’s
been shot in the back by A FARMER The farmer’s WIFE and
other TOWNSPEOPLE come running

FARMER’S WIFE

RUMBLING TANKS

A DOZEN OF THEM approaching from the East accompanied
by DOZENS OF SOLDIERS in jeeps and troop trucks

EXT GAS STATION - SUNDOWN

Bizarro lands at an abandoned gas station at the
intersection of roads going off into the desert He
looks around catching his breath Demoralized and
forlorn

He suddenly becomes aware of a FIGURE standing in front
of him He takes a step forward then realizes it’s only
HIS BLURRED REFECTION in a mirror on the wall

He looks at himself in the mirror crestfallen touching
his own misshapen skin

BIZARRO
Ugly monster

He looks down then back up into his own eyes

ee

BIZARRO (CONTD)
“Bizarro”

He looks up to see

A MASSIVE BOMBER rumbling overhead It releases an
ENORMOUS LASER GUIDED BOMB with a GLOWING GREEN
KRYPTONITE head

He lowers his head sadly as it sails diagonally toward
him and

BOOM

EXT DESERT TOWN
Lois and Jimmy turn to see

THE ENORMOUS FIREBALL rising from the earth in the
distance

ZOD AND URSA

Watch from a ridge overlooking the gas station as a huge
green cloud rises into the sky

Zod watches Ursa on the headphones his eyes twinkle
expectantly as she listens for the results

ZOD
Well WELL

Finally Ursa looks up a SMILE spreading on her face
Zod rises looking over the ridge

POV FROM THE RIDGE

As the smoke clears we see a huge crater in the earth
where the gas station was From this distant vantage we
see a tiny hulking figure his head hung down sad and
defeated He takes a deep breath looks skyward then
SHOOTS up and away - gone in an instant

INT COLLEGE CLASSROOM

GROWN UP SPENCER DALTON - now a young man in his early
20s - stands at a chalkboard in front of a group of
STERN LOOKING PROFESSORS He has an awkward charm and a
passionate exuberance about his subject A poster on an
easel reads “TRANSMUTATIONS OF THE BIZARRO-TIME-SPACE
CONTINUUM”

In front of him is a cheap looking replica of his
father’s duplicating scope aimed into what looks like a

microwave oven

Ok so for sake of demonstration
lets call this a

He takes a big fake glass DIAMOND and places it in the
device

SPENCER (CONTD)
Diamond

He activates the Bizarro Transmuter and there is a
little puff of smoke In full view Spencer cranks a
dial and a turntable inside the device turns When the
smoke clears we see that diamond has been replaced on the
platform by a walnut

SPENCER (CONTD)
Its Bizarro equivalent A Walnut

The professors sit stone faced as Spencer moves to the
next object on the table

SPENCER (CONTD)
Burning charcoal Guesses No

Two professors exchange bewildered glances

PROFESSOR 1
Is he serious

PROFESSOR 2
I have no idea

He picks the glowing charcoal up with tongs and deposits
it into the device He triggers the device again turns
the crank and Poof The turntable turns revealing a
chunk of ICE which he plunks into a glass of tea

SPENCER
ICE

He takes a sip

SPENCER (CONTD)
Note that Ive modified my
fathers original design It no
longer duplicates - but
transmutes a SINGLE object to and
from the Bizarro time space
continuum---

PROFESSOR
Im confused Werent we to see a
working device

One of the

SPENCER
Yes and I apologize profusely but
it was Youre not going to

PROFESSOR
I dont have time for this

professors stand up and EXITS followed by a

couple more

SPENCER
No no wait

Spencer picks up a BOWLING BALL from the table

SPENCER (CONTD)
A bowling ball Any guesses

PROFESSOR
A Wiffle ball An anti-matter
ball This is absurd There is
no opposite of a bowling ball

SPENCER
Not opposite Bizarro opposite

Spencer turns the crank revealing

A CUBICAL BOWLING BALL with three square finger holes

A beat then a mass exodus Theyve had enough Jimmy
turns to Lois whispers

JIMMY OLSEN
Pretty sure the kids bizarro

The last professor to leave turns to Spencer a sad look

in his eye

PROFESSOR 1

had hoped you would forge your own
path rather than spending your
life trying to validate your
father’s unorthodox
theories

SPENCER
(losing it)
My father gave his LIFE for this
This works This is REAL

In his passion he accidently knocks the square bowling
ball to the ground It hits the floor and cracks in
half Its made of painted plaster-of-Paris Sad

EXT HALLWAY

Lois and Jimmy catch up to Spencer as he pushes his down
the hall on a cart

JIMMY OLSEN
Whats the point The kids
obviously unbalanced

Lois ignores Jimmy and catches up with Spencer

LOIS
Spencer my name is Lois Lane I’m
a reporter I need to talk to you
about the night your father died
About the monster

Spencer stops in his tracks

SPENCER
I don’t know what you’re talking
about There was no monster

LOIS
You said it in interview You even
named him You called him Bizarro
Sound familiar

SPENCER
That was never published

LOIS
I found the original tape

She holds up a weathered cassette tape A beat

I was a kid My dad had just
died I hallucinated Even

Superman denied it happened I
was DREAMING It NEVER HAPPENED

INT BIZARRO’S WAREHOUSE

Bizarro sits gazing ahead with mournful eyes We pull
back to reveal that he’s sitting in a little pathetic
“bedroom” in the corner of an enormous warehouse - a
former military aircraft assembly plant - now gutted and
abandoned The mattress he sits on is bare and the bed
almost bends to the ground under his weight

ZOD
gently)
I knew youd be back I see you
found your bedroom

Zod walks up to the bed and looks down at Bizarro
Bizarro sighs After a long beat

BIZARRO
defeated)
Me am Bizarro
ZOD
I know I know I tried to tell

you

He sits beside Bizarro and lays a stack of SUPERMAN
COMICS on the table A beat

ZOD (CONTD)
Lies all lies Hes no
superman Hes a sociopath

Bizarro looks from the heroic comic covers to Zod his
interest piqued

ZOD (CONTD)
Ursa and I came to this planet as
immigrants Simple wanderers in
search of a home

FLASHBACK

FLAMES ERUPT CARS EXPLODE BUILDINGS COLLAPSE PANICKED

CITIZENS SCREAM AS THE SMOKE CLEARS WE SEE ZOD URSA AND
SUPER-HENCHMAN NON WALKING TOWARD CAMERA REVEALED AS THE
SOURCE OF THE CONFLAGRATION

BACK TO SCENE

ZOD (CONTD)
We hoped to be friends with
Superman But he hated us
Perhaps he was jealous He
wanted to be the ONLY superhero on
Earth I suppose Sound familiar

Zod glances at Bizarro innocently to gauge his reaction
Its working Bizarro listens intently Indeed this is
just like what happened to him

ZOD (CONTD)
He tricked us We were too
trusting too innocent I suppose
He used the Molecule Chamber in
his Fortress of Solitude to strip
us of our powers to cripple us
but that wasnt enough

FLASHBACK

ZOD FALLS BACKWARD INTO A DEEP ICY CREVASSE IN THE FLOOR
OF THE FORTRESS FOLLOWED BY URSA

ZOD (CONT’D) (0S)
He threw us to an icy grave
The whole world thinks we are
dead But we survived Ursa and I
It took three days to dig our way
out and three more to find help
We never found our friend Non

BACK TO SCENE
ZOD (CONTD)
And then when he tired of this
world he abandoned it Leaving
the world without a hero

Bizarro looks into his eyes empathetic JZods got him
hook line and sinker

ZOD (CONTD)
I know you’re confused bewildered
about this world - but the rules
here are simple I will teach you
And if you do what I say SPEAK
the way I teach you they will
learn to love and appreciate you
as much as they loved that
imposter who robbed so much from
the both of us You can help us
Bizarro And I believe you will
because you’re a GENUINE hero

Bizarro looks up at Zod

BIZARRO
Hero

The idea of this means the world to him

ZOD
Youre the key You can make
everything all right again
Youre going to help us get the
molecule chamber Youre going to
get our powers back And then Ursa
and I will help you take your
rightful place as the protector of
these people Theyll cheer your
every heroic act Theyll build a
statue in your honor

BIZARRO
Statue

ZOD
A big one

Bizarro smiles his face full of hope Hes made his

decision

BIZARRO
How me hurt you

ZOD
How me help you Say it

BIZARRO
How me
(struggles learning)

Help you

Zod smiles puts his arm around Bizarro

ZOD
Well work on that mangled English
of yours dont worry

Bizarro looks down slightly ashamed
ZOD (CONTD)

Now show your appreciation and
kneel Kneel before Zod

Bizarro stands up perfectly straight then smiles
seeking approval

ZOD (CONTD)
Well Rome wasnt built in a day

INT STARBUCKS

We join Lois Spencer and Jimmy in the middle of a
discussion

LOIS
I dont understand He clearly
said he intended to hurt the
girl

SPENCER
But he could have meant the
opposite He could have meant he
wanted to help her

JIMMY OLSEN
(skeptical)
This is your Bizarro space-time
thingy right Your square
bowling ball

SPENCER
That is based on solid theory

LOIS
Ok Spencer deep breaths Now if
you had to guess why would
someone want to bring it back

JIMMY OLSEN
Its obvious To use as a soldier

SPENCER
No way impossible Believe me
it would be un-trainable
(thinks)

SPENCER (CONTD)
What I dont get is why did they
steal my transmuter if they
already have Bizarro It makes no
sense

LOIS LANE
No this is good Whoever took it
must have seen the real device in
action right So we just find
the people you showed it to
narrow it down and find Bizarro
So who did you show it to

Spencer grows quiet

LOIS LANE (CONTD)
Was it a lot of people

SPENCER
Well I sort of made a video

LOIS

Who saw the video Spencer

SPENCER
I sort of put it on Youtube

Lois stares at him Yep thats the worst case scenario

The abandoned facility looms like an old castle in the
moonlight

INT ZOD’S COMPOUND - FOREMANS OFFICE

Spencer’S YOUTUBE VIDEO plays on a computer screen on
Zod’s lab table

ON THE VIDEO Spencer fiddles with the controls of the
device and turns a BOWLING BALL into a SQUARE BOWLING
BALL which he drops to the ground with a solid THUNK
This one is obviously REAL

ZOD watching replicates Spencer’s movements as he sets
the controls of the ACTUAL TRANSMUTER - the one we saw at

the beginning of the movie - sitting in front of him

Ursa is sharpening a GLOWING GREEN DAGGER on a wheel
She finishes and hands it to Zod who turns it in his
hands contemplatively

ZOD (CONTD)
How strange it is to touch
Kryptonite with my bare hands

Zod moves to a large observation window which affords a
view down into Bizarros large warehouse space

ZODS POV - WAREHOUSE

Down in the warehouse Bizarro has piled rocks and wood
here and there and assembled a sparse ‘town’ of sorts
Crudely assembled figures constructed of BOULDERS and
STICKS represent citizens in the city

Bizarro walks down the street then “spots” a female
boulder person pointing at a boulder crook with a purse
dangling from his stick arm

BIZARRO
(as victim)
Help help he am steal purse

We pan across to see the Purse Snatcher a boulder with a
ski-mask on his head

BIZARRO (CONTD)
Me am help you Me am real
Superman Me am Bizarro

He flies over to the purse snatcher boulder man and
punches him then “returns” the purse to the boulder
woman and hauls the crook off to a hut marked “Prizin”
But he slams the prizen door so hard several buildings
collapse one of them right on top of the boulder woman
He looks at the rubble frustrated

BIZARRO (CONTD)
Me am do again Me am hero Me
am do again

He sets up the figures as they were before and begins to
try again

ABOVE IN THE FOREMANS OFFICE
Ursa moves to the window to join Zod

URSA
What on Earth is he doing

ZOD
(bemused)
Learning to save the world

Zod turns and moves to the Transmuter placing the knife
inside He triggers it Swirling particles swarm the
knife it GLOWS changing color from green to BLUE

ZOD (CONTD)
And by the time he is done
saving this world they will
willingly hand over the Molecule
chamber for what we have to
trade

ZOD and URSA sit watching him Zod produces THE BLUE-

KRYPTONITE KNIFE and draws it lightly across Bizarros

at the wound

goes back into deep slumber

client is prepared to give ample
proof of his claims All he
desires is a fair trade

already this is GENERAL ZOD

Enough talk

Everyone turns to disguised Zod

ZOD (CONTD)
That monster is on the loose and
there is only one way to kill it
As you have seen it cannot be
killed by green kryptonite But
this This will kill it

General Zod reaches into his pocket and retrieves a small

GLOWING BLUE ROCK the size of a marble

ZOD (CONTD)
Blue Kryptonite The machine in
my possession converts anything to
its Bizarro equivalent In this
case green kryptonite to blue

GENERAL PACKARD
Where did you get your hands on
Kryptonite in the first place

LAWYER
As Ive told you my client is a
collector and this sample was
acquired well before the
Kryptonite Regulation Act

GENERAL PACKARD
This is insanity Let’s say the
Molecule Chamber exists and I’m
not saying it does It only has
an effect on Kryptonians What
possible use would it be to you
Unless of course you’re from
Krypton

The Lawyer smirks

LAWYER
My client will be willing to sign
an affidavit to the effect that is
not now or has he ever been
Kryptonian

Some snickers in the room

which BLASTS right past the trash can extinguishing the
fire like a match but ENVELOPING the side of the
PARLIAMENT freezing it

Behind him a HUGE FREIGHTER bears down toward the

A HUGE ALLIGATOR that has escaped from the habitat It

has gotten tangled in the red reptile area BANNER that
stretches across the viewing deck

Bizarro stands and moves closer as the alligator twists
and turns freeing itself The banner is now wrapped

around its neck like a cape

to their floor Silence as the doors open and

QUT STEPS BIZARRO dressed like CLARK KENT Well sort

Nobody moves a muscle as Bizarro makes his way across the
newsroom past Lois and Perry

BIZARRO
Hello Perry White Me am get good

Hello Lois Lane

Everyone remains frozen like statues their eyes locked
on him as sits at Clarks desk and adjusts his seat He
cracks his knuckles then drags the computer keyboard
toward himself and mimes typing pawing at the keys in
bunches at a time The computer isnt even powered up
At the end of each “line” he pushes the keyboard to the
side as if it were a typewriter roller

BIZARRO (CONTD)
Me am ordinary reporter Clark
Kent not hero

He suddenly grabs a lamp and knocks it on the ground

BIZARRO (CONTD)
Me am clumsy Not hero Not

A white faced Junior Reporter hands him a cellphone He
takes it and begins to strip off his Clark Kent
disguise in full view of everybody When he is finished
he hands back the phone now in full blue and red
splendor

With this he turns to Lois and hands her a slip of paper

BIZARRO (CONTD)

He turns and heroically exits around the corner There
is the sound of a SMASH as he flies out through a window

Lois looks down and unfolds the note As she reads it
her eyes light up

some of the letters are backward It reads

LOIS
Hes got Supermans memories and
Superman is fond of me

After a long moment of contemplation the General
relents He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a
small cardboard BOX He opens it revealing a small GUN
similar to a high tech derringer In its glass chamber
is a small BLUE GLOWING BULLET formed from the blue
kryptonite sample He hands the gun to Lois

JET

JIMMY OLSEN

She stands and turns to look out at

HER BALCONY

Our expectation is that he will come flying down from
outside but instead--

CRASH He comes down through the bedroom ceiling He
lands in the corner of the room

BIZARRO
Goodbye Jimmy Goodbye Lois I

Hello Jimmy I mean goodbye
He strides forward GRABS Lois in his arms and

INT BIZARRO’S BEDROOMWAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Bizarro flies with Lois through a broken window and
deposits her gently to the ground then flies away into
the darkness Lois looks around but can only make out
silhouettes of CROOKED STRUCTURES surrounding her

She stumbles forward Bizarro has disappeared She can
hear footsteps echo off the walls Its ominous

LOIS
Hello Where are you Hello

She moves forward hands out feeling the walls
Suddenly she trips over something in the darkness She
looks up to find herself face to face with

KRYPTO THE ALLIGATOR

It LUNGES at her its jaws open wide

LOIS (CONTD)
AGGGGHHHHH

She scrambles back on feet and elbows but it gains on
her CHOMPING DOWN missing her foot by inches

Then it lunges - sure to tear a good hunk of meat off
this time - when suddenly it is JERKED BACK by a chain
around its neck anchored to a lamppost Lois backs away
as the thing continues to SNAP at her

She rises to her feet startled as suddenly the LIGHTS
around the warehouse begin to illuminate Shes
astonished by what she sees

A STRANGE FAKE BIZARRO WORLD HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED IN
THE WAREHOUSE

Its an entire miniature city street jury rigged from
scrap wood and metal and objects Bizarro has gathered
from his adventures in the world Mannequins made of two
by fours and sticks wearing discarded clothes populate
the street A dummy Kat is posed chasing a dummy
Dog Clouds made of bricks hang by wires above and
painted stars shimmer in the Sky The moon is a
manhole cover

ON LOIS
Astonished as she looks around taking in the crazy
backward details of the world She turns slowly
suddenly terrified as she sees
BIZARRO STANDING ACROSS THE STREET
A crazed grin on his face Hes holding a ROPE
BIZARRO
Look out Loiz Lane Boat am fall
from sky

He PULLS the rope There is a SOUND from above

LOIS

Looks up as she hears a CREAKING SOUND above her
ROOF OF BUILDING ABOVE HER

A LARGE BOAT teetering incongruously on the top of the
building FALLS STRAIGHT DOWN TOWARD HER

ON LOIS

As she SCREAMS DIVING OUT OF THE WAY

ON BIZARRO

Moving under the boat PUNCHING IT as it impacts The

rotten wood SPLINTERS AROUND HIM He looks around for
Lois

BIZARRO (CONTD)
Lois LOIS LANE
BACK OF BUILDING NEAR FIRE HYDRANT
Lois crouches in the bare structure behind one of the
buildings She pulls out the cardboard box with the
kryptonite gun and starts to load the chamber Her
hands shake
BIZARRO (0S) (CONTD)
(growing impatient)
Lois LOIS Where am LOIS
ON BIZARRO

He turns the corner and moves forward He arrives at the
fire hydrant but shes gone

SCAFFOLDING

Lois climbs reaching up for the top of the building
about twenty feet up

TOP OF BUILDING

Lois pulls herself onto the roof and stands leaning
against a large crate mounted above the floor She
fumbles with the gun loading the kryptonite bullet in
the chamber when suddenly THE FLOOR SWAYS UNDER HER FEET

She DROPS the bullet as the entire building SWAYS back
and forth

THE BULLET
Rolls to the edge of the roof
LOIS LUNGES

Catching the bullet just before it falls and looks down
to see

BIZARRO STANDING BELOW

He has the building in both hands and hes SHAKING IT
that crazed GRIN on his face

BIZARRO (CONTD)

LET GO LOIS LANE FALL OFF
BUILDING FALL

ON LOIS

As she hangs on for dear life but shes slipping

ON BIZARRO - ANGLE FROM GROUND

He continues to SHAKE the building then stops as he
hears LOIS SCREAM He looks up Lois is gone from view
He looks around Shes nowhere to be seen

THE ROOF

Bizarro flies up to the roof and looks around puzzled
Lois seems to have disappeared He moves to the edge of

the building and peers over looking for her as

-Lois approaches from behind She moves closer the
kryptonite gun ready and loaded in her hand

As Bizarro continues to search for Lois below

Lois raises the gun to his head She narrows her eyes
and slowly begins to squeeze the trigger

BIZARRO (CONTD)
(sad)
Me only want save Lois Lane
Lois cocks her head thinking

THE TRIGGER

Slowly she releases her grip on the trigger There is a
soft CLICK as the hammer rests into place

LOIS
(realizing)
Save

ON BIZARRO

He WHEELS at her voice startled knocking Lois away like
a feather

ON LOIS

She goes TUMBLING off the side of the building
screaming

ON BIZARRO

He looks around - where did that scream come from - then
spots Lois FALLING

ON LOIS FALLING

In the background we see Bizarro rise and come FLYING to
save her

He flies FASTER and FASTER as she falls starting to
catch up with her descent

BOTTOM OF THE BUILDING

Lois falls toward the ground closing her eyes And
then just as all looks lost

-It is Her body slams into the ground

Yes she actually hits the ground HARD on her side
Her eyes OPEN WIDE she HOWLS in PAIN clutching her
shoulder

LOIS (CONTD)

If its not clear I think we were all expecting that
Bizarro would catch her Bizarro included

Lois lies there a moment letting the pain subside Then
with some effort she sits up her back against the wall
and begins to check for broken bones Shes lucky the two
story fall didnt kill her

Bizarro stands above her not sure what to do looking
very uncomfortable He turns and grabs a nearby object
putting it in front of her sheepishly
Its a typewriter
BIZARRO
(sheepishly)

You am write story now

She looks at him in disbelief then laughs grimacing at
the pain it induces

LOIS
You Wanted to save me

He nods sadly
LOIS (CONTD)

And you wanted me to write the
story

He nods Bizarro sits next to her his back against the
wall Its suddenly all become clear to her His eyes
are kind he means no harm A long moment passes

LOIS (CONTD)
Where did you come from

He thinks about this then looks around at the strange
world hes made

BIZARRO
Here HTRAE
LOIS
Htrae Wait Backwards

Earth

He nods She looks at the longing look in his eyes
beginning to understand

LOIS (CONTD)
This is what normal Earth looks
like to you
(a beat)
Our version must be incredibly
confusing to you

He nods

BIZARRO
It am Bizarro

A smile spreads on his face He actually meant that as a
joke Surprised Lois laughs genuinely A beat

LOIS
Who brought you here I need to
know

Bizarro looks down He shakes his head

BIZARRO
No Him say not to---

LOIS
Him Who Bizarro Tell me
please Trust me
Bizarro looks into Lois eyes A long moment of thought
then he looks like hes about to say something when
suddenly--

Loiss eyes widen as she sees

BEHIND BIZARRO

A SHIPS ANCHOR comes swinging down and knocks into the
side of Bizarros head sending him tumbling out of
frame

ON LOIS

She barely has time to register this when Jimmy Olsen
comes running into view

JIMMY OLSEN

Jimmy drags injured Lois out toward his truck
JIMMY OLSEN

Suddenly Lois sees something She puts her hand over
Jimmys mouth and pulls him to the ground They peek out
behind the corner to see

emerge They begin unloading crates marked with MILITARY

The first round of FLAK EXPLODES in BLUE BURSTS around
him One of the concussions hits its mark and Bizarro
is HURLED sideways

He regains his balance and hovers breathing hard He
looks around confused disoriented and in terrible pain
He looks down his suit is RIPPED Blue BLOOD forms in
the wound For the first time ever Bizarro is
frightened

BAM BAM BAM BAM More concussions explode around him
tossing him about like a rag doll He clutches his gut
his head and soars upwards into the clouds hopefully
out of reach of the deadly blasts

ABOVE THE CLOUDS

He hovers listening Its quiet His suit is torn ina
dozen places His breathing is heavy hes in pain

Then he hears a sound A whine that becomes
progressively louder and louder and then He sees them

A DOZEN SAM MISSILES

Flying up through the clouds tracking him He turns and
flies away from them but they are fast

Slowly they gain on him nipping at his heels

He SLOWS suddenly The SAMS roar past him He WEAKENS
as they pass the blue kryptonite radiating into his
body

Relieved momentarily he turns to see

THE SAMS TURNING heading straight back at him

He tries to fly away but hes too weak They fly ina
cluster toward him and

EXPLODE in a huge blue fireball

fade the door opens and ZOD EMERGES FLOATING UPWARDS

Slowly he rises and limps forward He then realizes
where he is Hes in the middle of

Tanks burn soldiers lie slumped over vehicles Complete
demolition The Molecule Chamber lies SMASHED ruined

Stops and looks up at a figure in his path Its ZOD
hovering like Dracula Ursa behind him

Zod drops slowly to the ground and walks up to Bizarro

Bizarro smiles a ray of hope that his old friend is here
to help But Zod raises his foot and pushes Bizarro to

his knees Bizarro looks up at him confused

BIZARRO
Hurt

Zod smiles

ZOD
Yes I should think so

He turns to Ursa who stands next to the KRYPTONITE
TRANSMUTER Piles of unused green kryptonite weapons are
stacked next to it

ZOD (CONTD)
The baton

He motions to a MILITARY BATON fashioned from Green
Kryptonite Ursa nods and puts the baton into the
device transforming it Zod takes it from the machine
turning it in his hand

ZOD (CONTD)
Perfect

Without warning he brings the baton swinging into poor
Bizarros head Bizarro HOWLS hitting the ground hard
He looks up at Zod horrified and bewildered

BIZARRO
Why

ZOD
Because I hate you

BIZARRO
(hopeful)
Opposite hate

ZOD
No HATE hate I HATE you you
poor ridiculous freak

With this he swings the baton right into Bizarros
wounded shoulder Bizarro tumbles back with a cry of
pain tripping over the Bizarro transmuter which is
knocked over on its side its beam warming up

Zod comes at him SWINGING again Bizarro raises his
hand to shield his face and the baton hits his forearm
with a terrible CRACK Then another blow which sends him
flying

Bizarro looks up bewildered and heartbroken as Zod comes
FLOATING toward him flipping the baton in his hand

ZOD (CONTD)
You still dont understand do
you you freak I USED you to
regain my powers

Bizarro looks at the bodies strewn about the battlefield
BIZARRO

(realizing)
You You am kill everyone

ZOD
No YOU did Bizarro
BIZARRO
But Me am Hero
ZOD
Youre useless A fool
BIZARRO
Me save world
ZOD

Youve guaranteed its enslavement

BIZARRO
Me am SUPERMAN

ZOD
Yes Enough for me to thoroughly
enjoy this

He unsheathes a concealed blue kryptonite DAGGER from his
coat and ATTACKS with a ROAR

Bizarro terrified jerks away as the knife SLASHES
inches from his face and his momentum takes him tumbling
backward

-right into the beam of the the BIZARRO TRANSMUTER
There is a FLASH OF LIGHT and everything goes PURPLE

Slowly we

FADE FROM
PURPLE

EXT BIZARRO WORLD - CITY PARK

Bizarro lies on the ground unconscious His eyes flutter
open and he sits up Wincing in pain he rises and looks
around His eyes widening in wonder at what he sees

Its THE REAL BIZARRO WORLD Hes been transported there
by the device Hes in the middle of a Bizarro park
Around him BIZARRO CHILDREN play dragging LEAD BALLOONS
and eating ice cream cones upside-down A cat runs by
chasing a dog Birds leap out of a nearby pond A
passing garbage truck passes and the BIZARRO GARBAGE MEN
throw trash all over the street A fire truck pulls up
and douses the spouting park fountain with flame throwers
until the water is put out

Bizarro stands and wanders forward in a daze

Around the park towers the surrounding cityscape The
streets twist haphazardly and crooked buildings zig zag
into a sky filled with granite clouds A flock of fish
fly past a grey rainbow

Then from down the street BIZARRO KRYPTO comes running
toward him his cape waving majestically Krypto jumps
up and licks his master happily

Bizarros expression turns from awe to joy as a tear
rolls up into his eye

BIZARRO
(sighs so happy)
Home

We PULL OUT from Bizarro back past the teetering columns
of the city back past the granite clouds into

SPACE
From here we can see HTRAE in all its glory as the

colorful CUBE SHAPED PLANET revolves slowly in the
vastness of space

FADE IN

TV NEWSROOM - METROPOLIS

Two MORNING NEWS CO-HOSTS (RYAN and MARKIE) plaster fake
smiles on their face in an effort to appear chipper as
they deliver one horrifying story after another Markie
we remember as Lois protege at the Daily Planet

MARKIE
Happy Wednesday everybody and
welcome to Good Morning
Metropolis

RYAN
Its day ninety two of the Great
Reign of Zod--

MARKIE
Hail Zod

RYAN
Hail Zod Markie and another
wonderful day it is

MARKIE
Great news from Zod-Virginia
yesterday as only thirty eight
conscripted workers perished in
the Aluminum Mines--

THE SCREEN BEHIND THE ANCHORS plays footage of THE MINING
FACILITY where thousands of CITIZENS toil as SLAVES
whipped by EX-CONS in uniforms The Citizens wear their
work clothes suits dresses whatever they were wearing
they were enlisted Its obvious they were just pulled
off the street with no warning

RYAN
Thats a new casualty low

MARKIE
Not only that but production is
up a whopping 120 percent from
August

RYAN
Wow And with six thousand
warships already in the fleet
were well on our way to Zods
goal of complete Universal
domination

WE SEE FOOTAGE of the MILES OF WARSHIPS being built
across the fields of IOWA

MARKIE
Ill trade fresh corn for security
ANY day

RYAN
Hail Zod Mary

MARKIE
Hail Zod

RYAN
And speaking of fresh there was
more freshening up of Washington
DC today as the White House was
moved aside to make way for The
Palace of Versailles

MARKIE
Sacre Bleu All the way from Zod-
France

Behind them on the blue screen we see footage of THE
PALACE OF VERSAILLES being lowered onto the spot where
WHERE THE WHITE HOUSE USED TO BE URSA just sets it down
as if it were a dinner plate

In the background the White House sits cracked in half

and discarded on the top of a JUNK PILE consisting of
other treasured edifices among them the Lincoln Memorial

and the Washington Monument

RYAN
Thats right Markie With more
than 2000 windows 600 rooms and
1200 fireplaces its a perfect
place for Lord General Zod to rule
AND entertain

MARKIE
Unfortunately a number of
Freedomites came out of the
woodwork again to mar the
occasion

(MORE )

MARKIE (CONTD)
Many of them apparently ex-
military from the Old-History
Boo

RYAN
Like ants at a picnic Luckily the
liberated former inhabitants of
Rikers Island were newly deputized
and on the job

We see CRIMINAL TYPES with shields and clubs suppressing
a small band of unarmed PROTESTORS

RYAN (CONTD)
Weve got some of those fine lads
employed here in fact to keep us
on our toes dont we

They cut to a shot of the studio where ARMED THUGS watch
for any problems in the newscast

MARKIE
We sure do great group of guys
And if Zods security forces dont
catch those dissenters the newly
operational security monitors
will

We see footage of TELESCOPING SECURITY SENTRY POLES the
ones Bizarro planted from the Fortress of Solitude -
whirring panning and scanning - keeping watch over the
populous

MARKIE (CONTD)
In other news two thousand
dissidents have been rounded up
and scheduled for execut---

Markie hesitates the words sinking in The cracks in
her chipper facade begin to show

She gets a stern look from the THUGS watching from behind
the camera

She tries to pull it together her voice cracking

MARKIE (CONTD)
for execution today as a
reminder of the need for obedience
to Lord Emperor Zod With crimes
ranging from potential subversion
to Enemy of Zod you can never be
too careful when it comes to
traitors

(MORE )

MARKIE (CONTD)
Notable among this group is Old-
History news journalist Lois
Lane Who

Her eyes begin to well up as she tries to stay
chipper

MARKIE (CONTD)
Who I worked with for many years
and

Some of the thugs exchange glances and draw clubs from
their holsters

MARKIE (CONTD)
And Im sure its all for
the best

RYAN
(soft insistence)
Hail Zod Markie

He turns waiting for her to echo the sentiment Markie
says nothing Ryan looks worried There is TENSION in
the studio then finally Markie speaks

MARKIE
SUPERMAN SUPERMAN IF YOURE
OUT THERE IF YOU CAN HEAR ME
YOUVE GOT TO HELP US PLEASE
PLEASE HELP---

There is a BLUR as the camera gets knocked aside GUARDS
grab Markie and the screen goes BLACK

INT THE PALACE OF VERSAILLES - FREEZER DETENTION ROOM

We follow two of Zods DEPUTIZED EX-CRIMINAL GUARDS as
they enter the FREEZER DETENTION ROOM The room is lined
with glass freezer cells not much larger than upright
coffins Various DISSIDENTS occupy the freezers
ordinary looking citizens soldiers ex-city officials
Some pound and claw on their cell walls trying to escape
some huddle on the floor shivering waiting to die

The guards stop in front of one of the freezers

GUARD 1
This one

Inside is LOIS LANE Shes shivering barely conscious

INT ZODS THRONE ROOM

Lois is led by the guards to Zods throne Zod sits
sipping tea

GUARD 2
Kneel before Zod

Shes pushed to her knees She looks up shivering

ZOD
Youre shivering Would you like a
sip of hot tea

She looks up at the steaming cup unable to speak She
reaches up for it

ZOD (CONTD)
I imagine you would As I clawed
my way through the ice under the
Fortress of Solitude I thought of
nothing else

He slowly POURS the contents on the floor in front of
her then turns to his servant

ZOD (CONTD)
Clean this mess up

The enslaved SERVANT legs shackled hobbles over and
cleans up the tea then begins to refill his cup

LOIS
Y-You wont get away with this
Zod Hell be back

ZOD
Bizarro First Ive destroyed
the machine and second if you
think that baboon has any chance
of--

LOIS
Superman

ZOD
The sooner the better Oh of
course you havent seen the
results of my space program yet

He motions to a MONITOR Lois turns to see

ON THE MONITOR

We see footage from space pointing back to earth where
a spherical shield consisting of HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of
GLOWING WHITE ROCKS orbit the globe criss-crossing in
all directions

ZOD (OS) (CONTD)
Shielded Kryptonite of course

A piece of SPACE DEBRIS the SPACE STATION drifts into
the path of the shield and is instantly DEMOLISHED in a
GLOWING GREEN CLOUD

BACK TO ZOD

ZOD (CONTD)
He wont even know what hit him
My only regret is that he wont be
able to witness your death

Lois stares at the screen her hope fading The SERVANT
too looks at the screen accidently spilling tea on Zods
arm

ZOD (CONTD)
What have you done you idiot

He turns to a guard

ZOD (CONTD)
Kill his entire family

The guard turns and starts out the door

SERVANT
No please Lord General Zod
Please Ill do your bidding
please leave my family alone
Please merciful Zod

He goes to his knees Zod motions to the guard wait

ZOD
Very well But only because I
still enjoy the novelty of hearing
you beg Mr President

The ServantPresident of the United States lowers his
head as he refills Zods tea

EXT METROPOLIS STREET

Jimmy Olsen hides in an alleyway as a detachment of Zods
POLICE go by dragging a prisoner a YOUNG DAD in his
20s to their squad car

YOUNG DAD (MR WEAVER)
No please It was only a bag of
peanuts Our boy hasnt eaten for
three days Zod promised us
relief

POLICEMAN 1
Shut up and get in the car

The cop pushes him roughly into the vehicle As the car
drives off we notice the back HUBCAP is missing

Jimmy his back against the alley wall sneaks the stolen
hubcap into his coat

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING

Jimmy keeps his head down as he walks past a number of
SECURITY MONITORS telescoping up from the street The
world is now blanketed with the things They follow his
movement as he passes

A GUARD looks at him as he enters the building

GUARD 1
Hail Zod

JIMMY OLSEN
(super enthusiastic)
Hail Zod absolutely Best ruler
EVER

The Guard watches him suspiciously as he passes

INT JIMMY OLSENS APARTMENT

SPENCER
Did you get it

Jimmy nods pulls the hubcap out of his coat Spencer
grabs it eagerly and affixes it to the BIZARRO TRANSMUTER
II a smaller backpack sized version of the original
This one is even more jury-rigged constructed of
gathered objects such as vacuum cleaner hoses and George
Foreman Grill housings

The hubcap mounted as a parabolic dish Spencer surveys

his work

SPENCER (CONTD)
That should do it You ready

JIMMY OLSEN
No Im not ready We havent even
tested it

SPENCER
The fusers thin as paper We
cant spare a test

JIMMY OLSEN
You dont even know if this thing
works with normal people Maybe
its one of your convoluted
Bizarro-only things where hes
safe and sound in another universe
but we get our eyeballs eaten by
hummingbirds for eternity

SPENCER
Thats definitely a possibility

JIMMY OLSEN
The hell with this dude To hell

A long beat

Jimmy reaches for the switch

SPENCER
Are you ready

JIMMY OLSEN
(sighs)
Im ready

EXT BIZARRO WORLD - CITY STREET

Theres a FLASH OF LIGHT

Were close on a GARBAGE BIN as a FLASH OF LIGHT from
inside illuminates the seams under the lid
moments of rustling from within a hand pushes the lid up
The bin is filled with all manner of valuables jewelry

rubies mp3 players new in their boxes etc

After a few

Jimmys head pops up from the garbage and he looks

around

At first his face is an astonished blank slate then
slowly as he takes in the insanity around him he begins
to laugh Slowly at first then maniacally

Spencer pops up looks around and smiles contentedly as
Jimmy continues to cackle uncontrollably

EXT BIZARRO WORLD - MAIN STREET

Bizarro Main Street is hodgepodge of real-estate zoning
where the next property one passes might just as easily
contain a house a skyscraper a forest or an airport

Jimmy and Spencer make their way down the street taking
in the bizarre wonders of the world around them

Square wheeled cars and bicycles clomp by and BIZARRO

DOGS strolling upright walk packs of BIZARRO DOG WALKERS
on all fours

As they pass an alleyway they see
IN THE ALLEYWAY
A BIZARRO STREET THUG robs a BIZARRO CITIZEN
BIZARRO STREET THUG
You am take all my money right now

or me shoot

BIZARRO CITIZEN
Ok ok Me take all of it

The Bizarro Thug hands over wads of cash to the terrified
Bizarro Citizen

BACK TO SCENE
They pass a school and see
BIZARRO SCHOOL GROUNDS

-A number of BIZARRO CHILDREN running out to the
playground and taking seats on the jungle gyms and
slides opening their books to study One BIZARRO BOY is
grabbed by the teacher by his collar

BIZARRO TEACHER
Not so fast You am pass your
test with flying colors you am
top student No recess for you

The Bizarro Boy looks sad as hes led back into the
schoolhouse

BACK TO SCENE

There is so much of this kind of activity going on around
them that Spencer and Jimmy are actually beginning to
take it in stride

SPENCER
I want you to say it

JIMMY OLSEN
You really think thats the most
important thing right now

SPENCER
Yes I do

JIMMY OLSEN
You were right

SPENCER
There see Now we can move on

Suddenly they turn as a hulking FIGURE offers greetings
as he passes by Its BIZARRO

BIZARRO
Goodbye Jimmy Olsen It am a very
unpleasant day amnt it

Hes wearing an oversized granite PENDANT around his neck
that reads BIZARRO 1 He doesnt even bother to
stop just keeps walking down the sidewalk and around the
corner

SPENCER
Come on
EXT BIZARROS HOUSE
A modest house which like everything else in Bizarro
World is crooked and wrong in its construction The
chimney sticks out of the side of the house The front

door tilts 45 degrees

Bizarro walks up the steps of his house throws the
newspaper out to the street and shuts the door

Jimmy and Spencer watching follow up the walk
INT BIZARRO’S HOUSE

Spencer and Jimmy knock softly and enter to find Bizarro

sitting on a chair watching television

JIMMY OLSEN
Bizarro listen you have to come
back with us You-

BIZARRO
Shhh TV in the middle of
watching me

They look at the TV and realize that instead of a screen
it has an enormous fleshy eyeball which looks around the
room blinking occasionally After a few moments of

this the bulbous eye closes

BIZARRO (CONTD)
Okay me am over What you not
want

JIMMY OLSEN

Its Zod Bizarro Hes taken over
the entire world Hes enslaved
half the population and the other
half are being worked to death in
his factories And when Superman
comes back hell be flying right
into a trap

BIZARRO
Me care a lot

Jimmy turns to Spencer
JIMMY OLSEN
Was that Bizarro-speak or just
sarcasm
Suddenly he turns and yells out the window
BIZARRO
Hey you kids Stop planting grass
on my yard
Then he turns back and opens a magazine
BIZARRO (CONTD)

They not bad just correctly
guided

Spencer steps forward so Bizarro can take a better look
at him

SPENCER
Bizarro do you remember me My
name is Spencer Dalton I was
there the day you were born
The day you fought Superman

This gets Bizarros attention he scrutinizes Spencer

BIZARRO
Hmm You were much taller Yes I

SPENCER

Right Good Listen Bizarro the
Earth is in big trouble We need

BIZARRO
You am need Superman

SPENCER

sheer imperfection to fight nicest

JIMMY OLSEN

Because hes going to kill Lois
Lane

Bizarro looks up from his magazine real concern on his
face

BIZARRO
But But Lois Lane am not love

SPENCER
(gently)
Thats why youre a hero

Bizarro considers this Spencer exchanges a glance with
Jimmy Whats he going to do Tension in the air
Even the TV wakes up and looks from Jimmy to Spencer to
Bizarro eagerly anticipating his decision

EXT THE ROMAN COLOSSEUM - DAY

Zod sits with Ursa in the Imperial Box of the Roman
Colosseum thirty feet above the arena floor

IN THE ARENA BELOW

A MEEK MAN in tattered shirt and slacks perhaps a doctor
or accountant in his former life battles two ARMORED
THUGS with swords He does the best he can but is
ridiculously out-matched

THE IMPERIAL BOX

Zod and Ursa watch bored as a guard enters their box
and falls to one knee Hes got an incongruous Bronx
accent

GUARD
Oh great and glorious Emperor Zod
I present the prisoner you have
heretofore requested the presence
of

He rises and two other guards bring in LOIS LANE Shes
blindfolded her hands bound Zod motions for the guards
to remove the blindfold She squints looking around

LOIS
Why did you bring me all the way
here Zod

ZOD
I thought it appropriate that you
die where you lived

LOIS
In Rome

URSA
Metropolis dear

Lois follows her glance upward where she sees

THE SPIRES OF METROPOLIS rising around the Colosseum
Zod has brought the Colosseum and plunked it right in the

middle of Metropolis Centennial Park

Lois is astonished She turns as she hears a CRY from
the Arena

IN THE ARENA

The MEEK MAN continues to put up a fight but Zods two
gladiators have him on the ground in short order Zod
gives a thumbs down We hear the final cry of the
citizen below

LOIS
(horrified)
NO You monster Youll pay for
this youll pay
Zod snaps his fingers motioning to a soldier

ZOD

Bring in the prisoners Its time

to begin the executions

ARENA ENTRYWAY

The mammoth ARENA DOOR opens and a group of shackled
DISSIDENTS are led inside

IN THE IMPERIAL BOX
ZOD snaps his fingers again and
BELOW

THIRTY GUILLOTINES are unveiled spaced in a circle
around the arena floor

IN THE IMPERIAL ARENA
Loiss Jaw drops

ZOD (CONTD)
Oh dont worry None of those
are for you I wouldnt mix you
in with the rabble No with you
I intend to make a statement
There will be no mercy for
sympathizers of the Son of Jor-El

He motions to indicate something in the distance She
follows his gaze outward and

WE FOLLOW THE PATH OF HIS GAZE

Tracking out past the Colosseum walls across the
buildings and waterways all the way across Metropolis to

THE DAILY PLANET (the GLOBE atop the building now
replaced with a gleaming bust of ZOD) where we see a ROPE
affixed to the roof We follow the path of the rope down
down along the side of the building forty stories to

A NOOSE hanging ten feet off the ground This is Lois
intended fate

INT JIMMY OLSENS APARTMENT

Theres a flash of light from the living room Jimmy
Olsen Spencer appear in the middle of the room After a
moment of anticipation BIZARRO appears as well Jimmy
and Spencer slump exhausted Traveling between
dimensions seems to take a toll on the human body

JIMMY OLSEN
Does your mouth taste like tuna
fish and paper clips

SPENCER
I thought it was just me

Jimmy grabs an overcoat from his closet and hands it to
Bizarro

JIMMY OLSEN
Here put this on and well see if-

Suddenly they hear a SCREAM from outside

TEENAGE KIDS VOICE (0S)
No Please Let me go

EXT JIMMY OLSENS APARTMENT
The three step out of the doorway to see

THREE OF ZODS MEN roughing up a TEENAGE KID On the
wall next to him is evidence of the teens crime
Graffiti reading RISE UP AGAINST ZOD

One of the guards punches the kid and he falls to the
ground where the three begin to KICK him He rises and
attempts to run but theyre right on top of him
Theyre about to grab him again when the three thugs run
right in to the brick wall of

BIZARRO

Bizarro picks one of the thugs by the collar effortlessly
and SLAMS him against the wall

99

Another throws a punch his fist is broken on Bizarros
face He wails in pain Bizarro picks him up curls him
into a ball and hurls him like a baseball
ACROSS TOWN - SEWAGE PLANT
-into a CESSPOOL across the city

BIZARRO

SPENCER
Plain as day

Suddenly a low WHIRRING NOISE sounds The three turn to
see A SECURITY SENTRY POLE rising from the street behind
them It SCANS Bizarro then FLASHES a match made A
beat then a KLAXXON SOUNDS

JIMMY OLSEN
Not good

THEN MORE SECURITY SENTRY POLES RISE FROM THE STREETS

Dozens of them then hundreds as far as the eye can see

JIMMY OLSEN (CONTD)
SO not good

The laser shields unveil and ARM They glow BLUE

SPENCER
Bizarro GO Get out of here

Bizarro FLIES up as the blue kryptonite lasers start to
FIRE

IN THE SKY

Bizarro is hit AGAIN AND AGAIN by the beams His face
contorts in pain with each impact He lands trying to
shield himself behind cars and other objects but
wherever he lands more turrets appear His clothing is
RIPPED by beams and he begins to BLEED purple blood

BACK WITH SPENCER AND JIMMY

They spot Bizarro limping down the street in the
distance In pain he stumbles into alley while the
lasers continue to hit him

EXT ROOF OF THE DAILY PLANET

Ursa carrying a struggling Lois Lane lands on the roof
of the Daily Planet The giant sculpture of ZOD looms
above them Ursa speaks to Zod on a video phone

URSA

of the roof

INT ALLEYWAY

Spencer and Jimmy Olsen enter the alley to find Bizarro
sitting hunched on the ground exhausted

Bizarro looks at Spencer softly He seems to realize how
much the answer means to him

BIZARRO

He motions clutching at his heart Spencer nods
understanding This is an answer hes needed to hear for
a long time Relieved he pats Bizarro on the shoulder
a great weight lifted

SPENCER
Thanks Thank you

He turns a beat

JIMMY
Well what are you waiting for

Bizarro)

Bizarro nods and with a look of determination he
crouches and ZOOMS off in his cardboard armor

EXT STREETS

Dozens of SECURITY SENTRY POLES rise and take aim They
begin to FIRE as Bizarro passes overhead

Bizarro SKIMS just above ground level His arms
outstretched he begins to CHOP the poles down in his
path The things go flying like batons into the air
AS the security poles SMASH into windows and buildings
The INHABITANTS peek out of their dwellings lighting up
as they see

BIZARRO STREAKING DOWN THE STREET

A ray of hope

INT APARTMENT

The family watches in dread as the guillotine blades are
pulled up and readied for release

Suddenly theres a CRASH as one of the security poles
comes through their window and smashes into the TV

ON THE STREET

People begin coming out of their homes faces that
havent seen sunlight for a while now have a glimmer of
hope

ON BIZARRO

As he soars back up toward the ROMAN COLOSSEUM across the
city

INT ROMAN COLOSSEUM - ARENA

Zod walks in front of the row of guillotines as if hes
inspecting troops Executioners stand at the ready to
release the blades

IN THE STANDS

The wife of the food stealer (Mr Weaver) watches
tearfully as her husband below is secured into the
guillotine Her little boy next to her rises as he sees

his fathers face

NO DADDY

The mother grabs her son and tries to hold him before the
guards take action but they grab her and start to drag
her down to Zod

IN THE GUILLOTINE

MR WEAVER sees them and cries out

MR WEAVER
NO No leave my family alone

They FALL in unison

He closes his eyes as the blade falls toward his neck
with a horrible metal SHRIEK

-but then the moment passes and hes still
alive He opens his eyes and we

PULL BACK TO
SEE

All the blades are FROZEN just above the necks of the
prisoners The prisoners all look around amazed theyre
still alive We pull back to see that the blades and
guillotines are literally FROZEN They begin to CRACK
APART and CRUMBLE to icy rubble

ON ZOD

He turns apoplectic to see

BIZARRO

Standing across the arena He finishes using his freeze
ray and folds his arms

ZOD
You I dont believe it

Next to Bizarro the little BOY struggles to meet his now
liberated father but is held back by the GUARD

BOY
Let me go

The guard raises his hand to strike the boy but Bizarro
KNOCKS him flying into the stands then picks up the boy
and deposits him next to his dad They hug Bizarro
starts to turn the boy looks up at him

BOY (CONTD)
Thank you Bizarro

Bizarro looks down at him

BIZARRO
Take drugs stay out of school
He winks at him then turns to face ZOD
ON ZOD
As he strides forward unsheathing his GLOWING BLUE BATON
ZOD
You didnt learn your lesson did

last one now
He lifts the Blue Kryptonite Baton in the air and brings
it down toward Bizarro But Bizarro CATCHES it in his
wrapped hand swings his other fist and bam Zod goes
FLYING
THE BATON

Goes clattering into the stands

IN FRONT OF A TELEVISION STORE

A group watching the TVS in the window CHEER raising
fists Zod actually got PUNCHED This is HUGE

ON ZOD IN THE COLOSSEUM

Fire in his eyes He rises and CHARGES Bizarro with a
ROAR He IMPACTS and the two go FLYING through the
Colosseum wall

EXT METROPOLIS STREETS

People begin to POUR out of their houses and apartments

RANDOM CITIZEN 1
Come on

Random GUARDS try to hold them back but the people
quickly OVERWHELM them and continue down the streets
joining with other groups

EXT NEAR COLESSEUM

Zod and Bizarro go MANO-A-MANO exchanging powerful

blows the battle escalating in scope with every
exchange

Zod grabs a MAILBOX and swings it into Bizarros gut
Bizarro goes flying into a wall then frees himself

BIZARRO rips a FIRE HYDRANT from the ground and POUNDS
Zod in the face sending Zod through a window

ZOD hoists a passing CAR - the driver running for cover -
and CRUSHES it down on top of Bizarro

BIZARRO recovers and picks up a CEMENT TRUCK and slams
ZOD against the wall with it

Zod emerges grabbing an ENORMOUS SPIKEY STATUE from the
front of a building but his face falls as he looks up -
a shadow washing over him - and sees

A GRINNING BIZARRO hoisting THE ENTIRE ROMAN COLOSSEUM
ABOVE HIS HEAD We have a winner

CRRRAAAASSSSHHH The edifice comes CRASHING DOWN ON
TOP OF ZOD crumbling in a huge pile of rubble

BIZARRO
Up up and away

With that he DRILLS into the ground

ON THE GATHERING CROWD

They look around Where did he go Then

UP FROM THE RUBBLE

Comes Bizarro holding dazed Zod by the collar Bizarro
punches him once twice thrice then a final blow sends
Zod flying through THREE BUILDINGS and into a brick wall
THE CROWD

CHEERS as Bizarro strides through the building tunnels
toward Zod

ON ZOD

As he stands wobbly He reaches into his pocket and
pulls out his video phone then looks straight into
Bizarros eyes

ZOD
Ursa

URSA (0S)
(on video)
Yes General

ZOD
Execute Lois Lane

URSA
Yes General

Bizarros grin drops He stops dead in his tracks
horrified Zod smiles an evil smile Bizarro turns and
follows Zods gaze across the city

BIZARROS POV

We ZOOM across the city to the top of the Daily Planet
where Lois Lane noose around her neck is being shoved
to the edge of the building by URSA

Lois struggles to no avail Ursa gives a final shove and
Lois FALLS over the edge grabbing onto the lip of the
roof at the last second

URSA moves forward and CRUSHES Lois hand under her shoe
BACK TO SCENE
Bizarros eyes light in horror

BIZARRO
No Please

ZOD
Why dont you fly and save her

Bizarro looks down ashamed

BIZARRO
Too far Me not can save in time

ZOD
Correct

A beat Bizarro hears Lois cries of pain over the
speakerphone as Ursa continues to grind her hands

BIZARRO
Please Me am not do anything you
say

ZOD

In PROPER English

BIZARRO
(its strangely
painful)
I Will do Anything you say

ZOD
Take off that ridiculous outfit

Bizarro hesitates

ZOD (CONTD)
Now

Bizarro begins to tear off the armor Soon he is
naked in his tights and cape again

ZOD (CONTD)
(to Ursa on the
phone)
Wait

Zod eyes his BATON in the rubble and picks it up then
comes at Bizarro Bizarro is struck again and again
trying to fend off the blows

ZOD (CONTD)
Did I tell you you could defend

yourself Put your hands at your
SIDE

Bizarro complies lowering his hands Zod raises the
baton Thankfully we

CUT MERCIFULLY
AWAY TO

THE CROWD

Cringing and teary-eyed as Bizarro receives blow after
blow Face after face filled with sadness for what
Bizarro must endure We only hear the sounds of the
tragic beating When it is all over we

CUT BACK TO

BIZARRO

Crumpled on the ground beaten Zod looks down at him
satisfied then takes out his phone

ZOD
Its done Finish her

Bizarro is stunned he cant believe it Zod smiles
victoriously draws his knife and STABS Bizarro Bizarro
HOWLS

EXT ROOF OF THE DAILY PLANET

Ursas foot GRINDS onto Lois hand Lois cant take any
more She FALLS
BELOW

The crowd GASPS

ON BIZARRO AND ZOD

Zod turns and walks away from Bizarro leaving him
crumbled on the sidewalk He puts the blade back into
the Baton

The silent crowd PARTS as he walks forward But then we
see in the background

Bizarro rising to his feet Zod turns he cant believe
it as - BIZARRO CROUCHES for liftoff his face
contorting in pain and determination

BIZARRO
He ZOOMS AWAY toward the Daily Planet IMPOSSIBLY FAR in
the distance
ON LOIS
As she FALLS screaming We feel the distance down to
the ground the sheer horror of it
ON BIZARRO
As he picks up speed FASTER AND FASTER concentration
on his face weve never seen
CITIZENS ON THE GROUND

Point and shout as he passes cheering him on

ON BIZARRO

Lowering his head as he picks up speed faster even still
aS
ON THE GROUND

Citizens DUCK as a SONIC BOOM rings out

ON LOIS

Falling A small dot tumbling down the side of the
building Strangers hands reach out of windows vainly
trying to snag her

ON BIZARRO

Gritting his teeth he pushes FASTER EVEN STILL until the
AIR STARTS TO IGNITE around him A RUMBLING starts to
build

ON THE GROUND

Citizens looks up to see Bizarro streak by a hundred
times the speed of sound his wake pulling CARS into the
air and TREES from their roots Something STRANGE is
happening in the atmosphere

CITIZEN 1
Whats happening

CITIZEN 2
I dont know I cant---

Then suddenly theres absolute SILENCE as Bizarros speed
sucks the atmosphere away completely The citizens look
panicked for a moment their mouths moving but no sound
coming out and

IN THE AIR

As Bizarro gives one FINAL burst of speed We can SEE
the charged atmosphere behind him as the vacuum in his
wake COLLAPSES with a THUNDEROUS CLAP This is far beyond
a sonic boom this is an

ATMOSPHERIC BOOM

WHICH SHATTERS WINDOWS ON BUILDINGS AND CARS TREES LOSE
THEIR BRANCHES PEOPLE CROUCH HANDS OVER THEIR EARS
SOME BUILDINGS EVEN CRACK AND TWIST ALONG THEIR SUPPORT
BEAMS
VIEW OF EARTH FROM SPACE

The atmospheric boom expands like a SHOCK WAVE outward
further and further until the wave reaches the very edge
of the atmosphere and

PUSHES the atmosphere like a bubble BULGING IT
OUTWARD and

INTO THE INNER SPHERE OF ZODS ORBITING KRYPTONITE ROCK
FIELD

BAM The first rocks are thrown off their orbits and
COLLIDE setting off a CHAIN REACTION and the entire
field of kryptonite begins to CRACKLE and EXPLODE like
fireworks

ON LOIS LANE HURDLING TOWARD THE PAVEMENT

about to IMPACT THE STREET time seems to slow for Lois
She can actually take in the details of her death she
can see the horrified expressions of the citizens looking
up at her She can feel the NOOSE tighten on her throat
She closes her eyes and Just before impact

she feels rough hands beneath her She opens her
eyes as

STREET LEVEL

Bizarro SWEEPS her in an arc to slow her fall tearing
the noose away like a loose thread His elbows actually
GRAZE THE GROUND at the lowest point before the two SWING
BACK UP into the air like a pendulum

Lois looks at him with an astonished gasp She was
certain this was the end for her
ON THE GROUND

Bizarro lowers her gently to the ground Bizarro starts
to release her but she embraces him

LOIS
You caught me

BIZARRO

(deeply happy)
Me catch you

Bizarro takes a step back wobbly then COLLAPSES

LOIS
Bizarro

Jimmy and Spencer come running up excited

SPENCER
Lois Did you see that An
atmospheric BOOM It bulged the
entire atmosphere He must have
been going a million miles an--

They see Bizarro cradled in Lois arms and see the somber
expression on her face She glances down to Bizarros
body where we see--

--blood flowing from the wound in his body

SPENCER (CONTD)
Oh no

JIMMY OLSEN
Is he

LOIS
(sad)
I think so

Lois looks up into the sky where the GREEN BURSTS
continue to light up the sky and then Out of the sky
fall thousands of small GLOWING GREEN ROCKS the size of
pebbles We realize its hailing GREEN KRYPTONITE A
strange and magical sight

SPENCER
The orbiting kryptonite

Jimmy leans in softly

JIMMY OLSEN
Superman couldnt have done it
better himself

BIZARRO
No No insult Me no am Superman
(proudly)
Me am Bizarro

They laugh softly Suddenly Bizarro winces the PAIN is

worse Hes fading Lois looks down at him her eyes
welling with tears

LOIS
Im sorry Its not fair

BIZARRO
No Lois Lane

He up at her a bittersweet smile on his face

BIZARRO (CONTD)
Me am save Lois Lane Me am save
Earth Me am unhappiest man in
the world
(delirious smile)
Hello

With that his eyes flutter closed and he dies As the
realization spreads through the crowd hats and caps come
off in respect heads bow

A tear falls down Lois cheek as she cradles his lifeless
body

Suddenly the solemn moment is broken as

URSA (0S)
Attention Subjects of ZOD

Everyone turns to see URSA and ZOD floating down into the
center of the crowd Zod looks around sternly

ZOD
Cowards fools You pinned your
hopes on this jester Now you
will know the wrath of Zod All
of you kneel KNEEL before your
master and beg for mercy before I-

POW Zod is STUNNED as he turns and realizes an ORDINARY
CITIZEN has PUNCHED HIM And it actually HURT

THE CITIZEN Mr Weaver looks him in the eye tossing a
KRYPTONITE PEBBLE up and down in his hand

ZOD looks at the pebble then back up at the mans face
for the first time a look of fear in his eyes

ZOD (CONTD)
You think you can defeat me with a
PEBBLE

He GRABS Weaver by the throat but then realizes that the
rest of the crowd all begin reaching down and grabbing
PEBBLES from the ground He releases Mr Weaver and
backs away

URSA
No listen to your master He
commands you---

Lois grabs a nearby pebble vindication in her eyes

LOIS
Ill have some of that

She CHARGES Ursa PUNCHING her sending her flying into
the crowd

Ursa resists flailing viciously but is quickly overcome
by the Kryptonite-armed crowd

ZOD turns like a caged animal as the CROWD converges on
him There is nowhere to run

WE PULL BACK
TO REVEAL

THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS CONVERGING
ON ZOD FROM EVERY STREET IN THE CITY AND THEN AS HES
DEFEATED AND CARRIED OFF BY THE CROWD

-A HUGE CHEER OF VICTORY AND LIBERATION ERUPTS FOR AS
FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE

DISSOLVE TO

silver archway A plaque at the base reads

in and whispers to her

JIMMY OLSEN

protected him Why

LOIS

DISSOLVE TO

BIZARRO WORLD - HOSPITAL - NURSERY - DAYTERNOON

We push past BIZARRO DOCTORS and BIZARRO NURSES scurrying
in the halls past BIZARRO PATIENTS throwing PARTIES in
their rooms and bizarro PATIENTS taking turns operating
on bizarro Doctors

We push into a crowd of BIZARRO PARENTS of various
descriptions all wailing like newborn babies as bizarro
doctors spank their butts then move past them into the

BIZARRO NURSERY

Where a number of newborn BIZARRO BABIES lay in their
cradles smoking cigars handed out by two BIZARRO NURSES

BIZARRO NURSE 1
We am run out of cigars

BIZARRO NURSE 2
Hey look there am extra baby
That one

BIZARRO NURSE 2 (CONTD)
Baby count am incorrect Yay

BIZARRO NURSE 1

depression Me bake a cake

They exit excitedly and we pan down to the subject of
their discussion

IN THE CRADLE

Is a small BIZARRO BABY his eyes still closed Unlike
the others this one is wearing a little blue and red
outfit complete with cape His little body twitches as
if hes dreaming a dream of heroism Flying running
saving citizens A familiar rock slab hangs from his
neck the chiseled inscription weve seen before It
reads

Bizarro 1

The baby gurgles happily and we

CUT TO

BLACK

THE BEGINNING
