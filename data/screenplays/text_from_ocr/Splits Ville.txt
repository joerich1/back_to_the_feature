PAUL
It was like the second day of college
and we were late for Continental Drift
and Sea Floor spreading -- and then we
see this hot girl race up the steps in
front of us and Rob shoots me this look -

ROB

I didn’t know Paul was gay yet -
PAUL

I didn’t know I was gay yet
ROB

Are you gay
PAUL

(both charming and earnest)
Its a little unclear

ROB
Anyway we followed her into her Dante
class - and blew off Sea Floor Spreading -
and then I got myself partnered with her
to do a oral presentation for a class I
wasn’t in And - we’ve all been friends
ever since

PAUL
After she rebuffed your persistent and
awkward advances

ROB
Naturally

impersonating Christopher Walken when he

couldn‘t think of stuff to Say - but Toby

assured me that he was a good guy

EXT GOLF COURSE - LATER
CLOSE UP OF WES -

With the almost exact opposite look on his face He
stands in his version of golf attire (shorts and a t-
shirt) near the club house bag of clubs on his back

He looks to the first tee and sees the group of guys
gathered - Paul Rob Jim Kip and a few others He
steels himself and makes his way over

As he gets closer he sees what awaits him - Pauls mixing
drinks on the golf cart and everyones wearing “Toby and
Wes 2003 golf hats They all turn and greet Wes
enthusiastically as he approaches

PAUL
Wesley James Brown Welcome

Paul quickly shoves a drink in Wes’ hand

PAUL (CONT D)

to the tee box

Rob walks next to Wes and puts his arm around him
1903

ROB
So how you feeling Are you nervous

WES
Nervous Not really nervous

Jim walks up beside them

JIM
What has he got to be nervous about

WES
Exactly Mr Pullman Exactly my point

Wes presses on to the tee box with the rest of the group
He looks around at everyone Just looking at them
saying nothing He’s starting to freak them out

WES (CONTD)
Well before we start I‘d like to just
say a few words

PAUL
Go on you big sap

Wes takes a breath and smiles

WES
There’1l be no wedding today Or at all
Toby has called it off Should I do the
honors

With that Wes puts his teein the ground with his ball
on top of it grabs his club and takes a full swing at
the ball - making great contact No one can believe what
he just said Wes watches the ball fly - straight as an
arrow

WES (CONTD)
That‘’11 work

Wes picks up his bag and starts walking down the fairway -
leaving all of the guys in stunned silence

INT ESTILO SALON - DAY

her makeup impeccable ROAN the hairdresser is setting
beaded hairband with veil attached inte her hair
Catter Mollie and Sandra stand around her beaming as
the veil gets attached
1903 12

CATTER
You look perfect

TOBY
I don’t know I feel like the hairband
is a little high

She YANKS on it a little violently Roan stops her and
‘ adjusts it himself

TOBY (CONTD)
You dont think it looks a little high

SANDRA
I think it looks pretty perfect

Sandra looks at Toby in her veil and starts to cry

TOBY
Mom please don’t cry Seriously -- it’s
not necessary

SANDRA
Toby I’m gonna cry I only get to see
my daughter get ready for her wedding
once in my lifetime

Toby takes a look at herself in the mirror

TOBY
(softly)
Possibly twice

Everyone looks at Toby Uncomfortable silence envelops
everyone including Roan

CATTER
(trying to be calm)
PARDON

Toby takes a long slow exhale

TOBY
Tm not getting married today

Catter starts to hyperventilate and walk around in
circles

CATTER
What is she saying Mollie ask her what
shes saying WHAT ARE YOU SAYING
1903 13

MOLLIE
Toby sweetie what are you saying

Toby looks at them for a moment and then begins Her
tone leaves little doubt

TOBY

I’m calling it off I just - I realized
that it just didn’t feel right and that
Wes has taken such good care of me but I
think - I mean I know - what I really
need to do is take care of myself To
see what is me when it’s just me So I
just can’t do it

Stunned silence still fills the room Toby tugs
violently on the hairband again

TOBY (CONTD)
I don’t know I still think this thing is
a little high

Toby continues to re-adjust the hairband as Roan and the
ladies look at her in stunned silence

engagement No one said you could un-
engage

ROB
Mollie - please I think there are other
things to worry about now

Mollie thinks about this

MOLLIE
Youre right How’s he doing

Rob looks back and sees Wes in the sandtrap taking
multiple swings at a ball He’s making no contact at
all Theres just sand flying around him

ROB
He’s about 250 over par right now
MOLLIE
He’s going to act like everythings fine
ROB

Rob’s still looking at Wes who finally gets the bail out
of the trap It’s a high arching beautiful shot Wes
throws his arms in the air in victory

TOBY

place

KIP
What After grad school I wanted to
move back in and live here forever and
you guys wouldn’t let me

SANDRA
We wanted you to have your own place so

relationship

KIP
Toby got her own place - and look what

Jim sees the conversation going south and tries to save
it
1903 16

Sandra gets up and peruses the catering trays
SANDRA

breasts and 162 beef filets Who wants

Toby stays seated at the table as her family helps
themselves to outrageous portions of beef and chicken
They all sit back down and start to eat silently until

INT PAUL’S HOUSE - DAY

A mid-century cool Beachwood Canyon pad Paul sits at
the long kitchen table with Catter Rob and Mollie

feeling (rightly so) that there is often a Party of some
kind going here

groups chats

CATTER
What about the Holiday Pot Luck Secret

She smiles as he hands her a
Paul is like magical - he always has a drink to

until he stops at CATTER

drink
give

CATTER
You know I wags going to take two Ativan
to get through their wedding That‘s
what it takes now - two pills per
wedding

PAUL
Why Weddings are a bold statement of
hope in our crazy world With booze

Paul downs his drink happily

CATTER
I feel compelled to start the count-back
at every wedding

PAUL
The what

CATTER

The count back See if you work
backwards even if I met my future
husband in the next fifteen seconds wed
still have to date a year - minimum -
before a proposal probably eighteen
months - and then a year engagement - 80
the very soonest I could be walking down
the aisle is two and half years from now
And that’s if the guy is standing in your
kitchen It’s pathetic

Catter downs her drink

PAUL
So you should be happy that Wes and Toby
called it off Two more miserable single
people like you

CATTER
No - see that’s the thing That
depresses me too

PAUL
How is that possible

CATTER
Because it goes to show how unjust it all
is

(MORE)

ws

1903 23
CATTER (CONTD)

There are girls like Toby who get great
guys and toss them back and then there
are girls like me who only seem to date
guys who play bass and live at home and
fear commitment

PAUL
Guess youre screwed

Paul smiles at Catter kisses her on the head and moves
off to continue hosting

Catter stands there alone She walks to a tiny alcove
near the kitchen and pulls out her CEL PHONE She
scrolls through until she lands on the name TOBYWES
She hits SEND She waits as the phone rings And rings
Finally - the machine picks up It’s Wes’ voice

WES (0S)
Hey were not here - leave a message

Catter hangs up She stands for a second She then
walks to the kitchen - and as she passes them we stop

WITH ROB AND MOLLIE - Both seriously explaining something
to Paul Paul nods along in between sips of his drink

ROB
So were kind of screwed Most people -
they buy china pots towels They work
from the registry

MOLLIE
We got creative

ROB
First mistake I don’t think you can
return scuba lessons

MOLLZE
That’s like returning fruit

Paul considers their problem

PAUL
So you can’t return it Lets take this
So-called negative and spruce it up Are
either of you schooled in the art of
scuba

Rob and Mollie shake their heads no

PAUL (CONTD)
There you go
1903 24

With that Paul leaves - and the camera follows him as he
walks toward

TOBY - who sitson the kitchen counter alone taking it
all in As Paul walks by her he hands her a drink

PAUL (CONT’D)
Drink up momma

He continues on but we stay with Toby She takes a huge
sip of her drink As she brings it down she notices her
hand Actually she notices her ENGAGEMENT RING which
she’s still wearing She plays with it for a second
spinning it around before surreptitiously taking it off
and putting it in her pocket

EXT PAULS HOUSE - SAME
The limo pulls slowly up to the curb in front of Pauls
INT LIMO - SAME
Wes now sits in the front seat with Ark He is drinking
directly out of a bottle of Kettle One and he is loaded
They both gaze inside at the party through Pauls front
window - the sounds of MUSIC and LAUGHING carrying from
the party into the open limo window
WES

That used to be my life in there that I’m

not invited to
Ark isn’t sure how to respond

WES (CONT’D)
I gotta piss

With that Wes gets out of the limo

EXT PAULS HOUSE - SAME

Wes makes his way up onto Pauls lawn vodka in hand He
finds a tree to shield him from the street and PRES

And PEES And PEES It seems to go on forever

INT PAULS HOUSE - SAME

ROB looks out the window and sees something It’s WES
He tells Mollie Word starts to spread
1903 25

EXT PAULS HOUSE - SAME

Wes is still peeing but now a CROWD of people has
started to form on Paul’s stoop Wes finally finishes
And looks up He is caught He looks down at the vodka
bottle in his hand and - in a moment of drunken genius -
lifts the bottle in the air

WES
i came by - to make a toast I worked
hard on this toast and it probably wont
be applicable in a lot of other
situations and I didn’t want to waste a
good toast So - here goes I hope
youll indulge me

Wes takes another slug of vodka Wes pulls a slip of
Paper from his pocket and begins to read it to the crowd

WES (CONTD)
Heres to all of you my dearest friends
who have traveled from every corner of
the globe to be here tonight I hope
youre all having a wonderful time
because I’ve certainly had a wonderful
time having each of you in my life

Paul Rob Mollie and Catter all exchange concerned
looks Wes presses on

WES (CONT’D)
And of course let’s all raise our
glasses to my beautiful bride-NOT-to-be --
I dont know what I would do without you

The crowd is PERFECTLY SILENT Even Wes seems a little
surprised by what has just come out of his mouth He -
finally - feels a little awkward

WES (CONT’D

there for a second stung Then she turns to the papers
and starts to read

WES (V0) (CONTD)

Dear John Here’s something I’ve learned
quite recently girls suck You meet a
girl who seems normal - she has a real
job and she seems totally acceptable to
your friends and family and everything -
and then she turns out to be a freak A
total nutcase

Toby’s not sure how to take this

WES (CONT’D)
So I think youre on to something here
A prostitute Why not She’il never
cheat on you except for having sex with
hundreds of guys And I’m sure she’11
never leave you I think it’s a solid
plan

Toby spins her chair around to her computer and starts
to type As she types we hear her voice over and we go

agree with Wes’ advice if not the
sentiment You really have nothing to
lose

wrapper with a sly smile

‘ But most of all - I like the story behind
the story ‘

Virginias face goes pale

VIRGINA
Did you read last months advice to that
born again virgin It was -

Thomson totally ignores Virginia and barrels on -

THOMSON

I mean you two are these smart hip
kids who are totally in love and
committed to each other giving
relationship advice - it’s perfect You
are still irreverent and smart-assy -

which I love - but people also believe
that they can do it because you guys are
doing it

Wes and Toby sneak a look at each other

WES
Yeah umm - that’s not all that accurate

SILENCE Virginia is now fully panicked She and Toby
both look at Wes just waiting

WES (CONTD)
Because in all honesty Toby’s not that
smart

TOBY
And Wes is unbelievably un-hip

WES
She mostly has to “sound it out” if the
word is more than four letters

TOBY
He likes the Olive Garden for both the
food and the ambience

Thomsen laughs as he opens his menu Both Toby and
Virgina seem relieved that Wes has decided to play ball
The WAITER walks by Wes stops him

tennis racket ‘

As Toby continues on we can see Wes’ eyes get further

and further away He’s not even listening anymore He

looks around the restaurant - at all the couples eating
people laughing He turns back and looks at Toby as

shes telling the story She’s very animated - gesturing

as she talks And then he notices it His eyes go wide

IN SLO-MO Toby’s left hand gesturing with NO ENGAGEMENT

Judy puts Wes on hold Hold music comes on But it’s
that Tina Turner song that goes “We don’t need another

gets louder and louder and begins to consume Wesas he
stands on Sunset Blvd in front of Chin Chin People
continue to walk by as things get blurry - Wes is barely
keeping it together things start to spin Finally the
song is cut off by

up to his head and we see - it’s not a razor - its a HAIR
CLIPPER

with the flirt

TOBY

Toby looks at him sizing him up

CUTE GUY (CONT’D)

INT OFFICE - DAY

We pull back to reveal Wes wearing his nametag sitting
on a couch in a large spare office DANIEL 40s sits
across from him

DANIEL
I really think your column is well-
written or I wouldnt even be
considering you for the position -

WES
Thanks -

DANIEL
However I also need to know if you have
confidence in your talent as an
interviewer as well as a writer
Interviewing requires a whole different
skill set than what you are used to using
for your column at Noise

WES
You know it’s funny because in grad
school that’s what Toby and I wanted to
do

(MORE)
1903 44
WES (CONTD)

We imagined that we would be this
interview team - and we worked out this
whole “good cop bad cop” deal that we
thought would get everyone to reveal
themselves to us But our first
interview at the USC paper was with Matt
Dillon and Toby had been obsessed with
him when he was in the Outsiders and had
this poster of him from Rumble Fish that
she wanted him to sign So we go to
interview him and she’s supposed to be
the bad cop but she starts good copping
and I really suck as the bad cop but
evidently she can’t flirt as the bad cop -

Wes is enjoying his own story but sees that he should
bring himself back to the question

WES (CONTD)
Anyway yes I can do interviews

DANIEL
And how did you and Toby break down the
writing duties in your partnership Who
exactly did what

WES
You know also very funny Because we
get asked that question all the time and
Toby would always field it Oh man what
exactly did she say She has this really
funny metaphor that she always used -

Wes is trying desperately to remember and taking way too
long to do so He looks at Daniel and realizes this
interview is going south - fast

WES (CONT’D)
Well - enough about Toby Were not here
to interview Toby Were here to
interview me

He looks at his nametag

WES (CONTD)
Dave

Daniel cracks a smile Wes takes a deep breath and tries
to move on

PAUL
No You didn’t

Catter just stands there holding two glasses eyes on
the ground

PAUL (CONT’D)
Catter please tell me you didn’t

CATTER
(very softly)
I did It was just a kiss I just -

Paul turns away from her He is clearly PISSED

PAUL
Do you have any respect at all for the
little group we have established here I
mean I know you do the count back and
think you’re going to be single forever
and continue to date wildly inappropriate
men who will never marry you - but you
cannot take those frustrations out on
your friends We cannot go around
kissing each other’s fiancees I’m not
sure about the you but I don’t have any
other friends So Id appreciate it if
you didn’t fuck this up

Catter looks like she’s going to cry Paul is unmoved

CATTER
I shouldnt have done it

to burn She’s feeling a bit out of place

She gets to the bathroom - there are a few girls waiting
by the door She decides not to wait and turns around

She works her way back to John and as she nears she can
overhear the conversation he’s having with Pete

PETE (CONTD)
No shit

her way out of the party John follows

INT HOUSTONS - EVENING

Toby sits sipping a martini with Craig the cute guy
from the deli

CRAIG
So are those letters for real Or do
you guys write them yourselves

TOBY
No they are totally real

CRAIG
So do you have to read through hundreds
of them to find the good ones

TOBY
Well I usually let Wes do that

There is a tiny uncomfortable silence but Toby presses
on

TOBY (CONT’D)
I used to read through the letters with
him but it started making me so sad
about - like - the human condition you
know I mean what has transpired in
these poor peoples’ lives that they want
to marry their hookers or have three ways
with their UPS and FEDEX guys you know

CRAIG
You dont find those things a little
funny
1903 50

TOBY
A little But after a while it would
just make me profoundly sad So Wes
started reading all the mail and just
giving me a few choice letters He would
wade through all the sad stories for me
so I wouldn’t have to get so down

“Toby seems struck by what she just said It’s like she
has just started to realize what shes done

CRAIG
He sounds like a great partner to have

Toby considers this and nods

TOBY
Yeah

Then a waitress approaches placing an ENORMOUS PLATE OF
RIBS in front of the man sitting next to Toby at the bar

TOBY (CONTD)
Wow Those are some nice looking
stripes

CRAIG
Hommm

TOBY
Stripes We call them stripes because -
you know - ribs - it’s so body-part-
specific Like ordering toes or femurs
or something you know

Toby laughs at her own observation Craig doesn’t get
it Another moment of uncomfortable silence

TOBY (CONT’D)
You know what Thank you so much for the
drink and this is about to be the rudest
thing I’ve ever done - well not the
rudest because I did just call off a
wedding and all - but I think I better
just - go

Toby gets up pulls out some cash and leaves it on the
bar

absently and doesn’t respond at all

MITCH (CONTD)

Wes

ROB
Right Me Wes Im Wes And ready

Mitch looks at him oddly

MITCH
Now remember you are practicing using
your “buddy air” You and Toby are going
to go down she is going to take out her
own air supply - which will be pretty
scary at first but then you are going
to give her your buddy air which feeds
off of your tank - and the two of you
will ascend together

ROB
Yep Got it Wes I’m Wes

Rob and Mollie start to get into the pool Mollie gives
Rob a disapproving look

MITCH
You know it’s actually a perfect
exercise for newlyweds When one of you
loses their own air the other can share
their air and vice versa You should do
great

Rob looks nervous as he gingerly slips into the water
Mollie smiles and goes under too
1903 52

UNDER WATER IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER POOL

Mollie smiling and giving Rob the thumbs up takes out
her air supply - she is now HOLDING HER BREATH She
swims over to Rob

Rob is breathing from his tank but looks TOTALLY
PANICKED Mollie motions for Rob to give her his buddy
‘air Rob just looks at her panicked She motions again
and then - with no warning - ROB LEAVES HER THERE AND

SWIMS TO THE SURFACE

ON THE SURFACE

Rob breaks the surface taking out his breathing
apparatus and gasping for air dramatically He spazzes

over to the side

ROB
Oh man Man that was - crazy

The whole class is looking at him - where’s his new wife
Mollie finally breaks the surface really gasping for
air

MITCH
What happened

ROB
Dude - you get down there and it’s like -
who knows

Even Rob doesn’t seem convinced by this story

MOLLIE
I took out my air supply and motioned for
Wes to give me his buddy air but he
panicked ‘

MITCH
You realize of course if we had been on
an ocean dive you would have just killed
your new bride

Mollie shoots daggers at Rob Rob tries to lighten the
mood

ROB
So in terms of it being a good exercise
for newlyweds how’d we do

Mollie walks away leaving Rob alone on the side of the
pool

EXT WES’ (and TOBY’S) APARTMENT - NIGHT
Wes sits on the balcony smoking and staring into space

GIRL’S VOICE
Hey Smokey

Wes looks down onto the sidewalk where Catter stands in
her Gourmet Courier shirt looking tired

CATTER
Can I come up

WES
Im scared of you

CATTER
I won’t touch I promise

WES
Yeah Come on up

Wes waits Catter emerges onto the balcony with two
beers handing one to Wes She takes a seat next to him
Wes takes an awkward drag off of his cigarette

CATTER
So smoking is part of the “New Wes” Im
guessing

WES
Yep

CATTER

Looks pretty dumb

WES
Still working out the kinks

Catter summons her courage and turns to Wes

CATTER
Wes I need you to know that Im
incredibly sorry about what happened the
other night JI don’t know what’s wrong
with me

WES
Clearly I’m irresistible

CATTER
Yeah something like that
1903

They sit in silence for a moment

CATTER (CONT‘D)
OK maybe I do know what’s wrong with me
Im insane I rented Notting Hill
recently and I had to turn it off
because I was jealous Jealous of the
love of two FICTIONAL CHARACTERS Wes I
watch A Wedding Story on the Learning
Channel religiously and get constantly
incensed that all of these freaks have
found the perfect other freak -- and I
havent I just want to find someone
already so I can stop obsessively
tweezing my eyebrows and fake laughing
and just relax I shouldn’t have kissed
you but I was full of rum and
possibilities - and Ill just freak if
Toby finds out -

Wes smiles

WES
Your secret is safe with me

CATTER
Thank you Awesome Moving on Let’s
talk about you
Wes nods as he flicks his ashes into the ashtray
WES
Did you see that flick That was a nice
natural flick

CATTER
It was a nice flick

Catter looks at Wes

CATTER (CONT’D)
Anything else on your mind perhaps

Wes looks back at her-all seriousness
WES
(his voice a little shaky)
I don’t know how I‘m going to make it
alone Catter

Catter is clearly moved by his admission
1903 55

CATTER
Wes I know this is incredibly hard for
you It’s hard for all of us We all
love both of you We all feel like we’re
losing something And we don’t want to
have to choose between you -

WES
You don’t have to choose Toby and I -

Catter puts her hand on Wes’ hand and squeezes

CATTER
I choose you

Wes looks at her unsure how to respond

A smile starts to grow on Tobys face

TOBY

KIP

Toby hangs up the phone and keeps driving
EXT WES’ (and TOBY’S) APARTMENT - SAME

Toby pulls up to her old apartment Just as she is about
to get out of the car she looks up and through the
windshield she sees Catter and Wes on the balcony She
studies the image closer - Catter is looking meaningfully
at Wes her hand on his Toby looks - devastated She
lets her gaze linger on them for a final moment and then
hastily pulls away

FADE OUT

CATTER

Remember that time you were delivering

Catter looks at Toby nervous

CATTER
Is something wrong I mean of course

Total uncomfortable silence Catter’s expression turns
to HORROR

CATTER

TOBY
Tell me why

CATTER

TOBY

Tell me why - if you are my best friend -
I drive over to find you hanging out with
Wes on his balcony last night
1903

CATTER
Last night

The color starts to return to Catter’s face

CATTER (CONTD)
(very relieved)
Right Yes Last night We were just -
you know - just hanging out As friends

TOBY
I know youre just friends That’s not

- the point

CATTER
So what exactly is the point

Toby looks at Catter takes a breath and lets it out

TOBY

Youre supposed to pick me
CATTER

What
TOBY

In the split Youre supposed to pick
me We were friends in college before

CATTER
So you go with the one you’ve known
longer

TOBY
Yes

CATTER
Always In every circumstance

TOBY
I don’t know Catter But in this case
yes This is a really weird time for me
and I need your support as my friend

Catter looks at Toby and in one non-graceful move
inspiring a few honks pulls over to the curb and jams
the car into park

er

1903 59

CATTER
OK here’s the thing Toby And I know
this sucks to hear because it really
sucks to say but I gotta be honest I
think you‘’re making 4 huge mistake

TOBY
What This is just wrong -

CATTER
Wes is a great guy And the life that
you guys have built for yourselves
people dream about that shit I can’t ‘
understand why you would just - chuck it

TOBY
I shouldnt have to defend myself to you
It just didn’t feel right Catter That
should be enough It just didn’t feel
vight

CATTER
‘Are youre still sure it isn’t right

Toby considers this Although we see a little doubt
starting to creep in her answer is

TOBY
Yes Im sure Im pretty sure

Though neither Catter or Toby seem totally convinced
INT WES’ APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

Wes sits on his couch alone He’s deep in thought
He’s listening to the long opening to “At Dawn” by My
Morning Jacket As the song kicks in everything seems
to SLOW DOWN and he hears faint voices

He’ turns and sees a YOUNGER WES and TOBY sort of
ghostlike as if they’re PROJECTED ON THE WALL
struggling to carry a futon up the stairs Toby going
backwards is very serious as she keeps falling Younger
Wes can‘t stop laughing

IN THE BATHROOM - Wes peers in where he sees Toby
standing behind younger Wes dying his hair SLIM now
just a little kitten runs around on the sink getting
dye all over himself
1903 60

IN THE BEDROOM - Wes walks up the stairs goes in where
all around him Younger Wes with a windbreaker pulled
tight over his head tries unsuccessfully to shoo a bird
out of the window Toby hides in the closet and
intermittently looks out at the proceedings The bird
swoops all around the room narrowly missing the ceiling
fan and Wes’ head

IN THE LIVING ROOM - Wes then plops back down onto the
right side of the couch Younger Toby and Wes sit
cuddied up on the left side of the couch Older Wes
sits back and closes his eyes tightly Slowly the song
fades out as do the images of Young Toby and Wes°

Then its silent Wes opens his eyes and he seems - OK
THE PHONE RINGS Wes goes to pick it up

WES
Hello Yes Daniel of course from
Interview
A beat
WES (CONT’D)

Wow - Im surprised I mean and
thrilled You have the authority to do
that right just offer me the job
Right of course you do Wow Wow

Wes looks around and takes a deep breath
INT ROB AND MOLLIE’S APARTMENT - DAY

Mollie sits at the breakfast room table alone Rob
enters in full scuba gear grabs himself a coke out of
the fridge and joins her at the table

MOLLIE
You can change at the pool Rob
Everybody changes there

ROB
Yeah They make you wear that Speedo
under No one needs to see that

MOLLIE
Well Im not going today anyway

ROB
Because I wont change my clothes in
front of other men at the Jewish
Community Center
1903 61

MOLLIE
No Because we may as well admit it
It’s not going to work I knew posing as
a married couple was going to screw us

‘ ROB
I feel like I should go change

Rob gets up and starts to waddle to the hallway

MOLLIE
You killed me under the sea

ROB
It was just practice So now I will know
how to not kill you under the sea

MOLLIE
It was supposed te be a test of how we
could help one another and you suck

ROB
And you honestly want to break up over
this

Mollie just looks at him

MOLLIE
You bailed on me under there Rob

ROB
I panicked Mollie

MOLLIE
Well how do I know you won’t panic
again And bail Like Toby did to Wes
I didn’t think that could ever happen to
us but maybe it can

Rob finally gets it He sits back down with her

ROB

Mol I love you Listen it’s true - Im
a terrible frightened swimmer And I’m
a little neurotic about changing in front
of other men And I guess I can be a
little cheap sometimes But the point is
- I WILL NEVER BAIL ON YOU Toby and Wes
couldnt make it work And I’m sorry
about that I really am But we can i
have no doubt in my mind This is it for
me
1903 62

Mollie studies his face A big smiles spreads across
hers

SPLIT SCREEN WITH

CLOSE ON MELISSA - as she tries to navigate her way down
a steep driveway in heels She’s really upset

WES (V0)
So good luck John

We go FULL SCREEN TO

EXT HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - NIGHT

John trailing Melissa finally catches up to her
TOBY (v0)

The only thing we have left to say to you
is -- don’t fck it up

JOHN
Melissa wait What is going on
MELISSA
Nothing
JOHN

Youre not pissed

MELISSA
What Nooo I was just a little warm
so I thought Id storm out of the party
and down a hillside to get some fresh
alr

She continues to storm away
JOHN
Youre pissed because I told my buddy
what you do for a living

MELISSA

You think

JOHN
Melissa -

MELISSA

I actually started to believe that - I
don’t know - I was your girlfriend or
something

(MORE)
Ne

1903 63
MELISSA (CONTD)

But you just want to tell your little
pals that it’s cool that you brought some
“hooker to a party

JOHN
No

MELISSA
Then why did you tell him

JOHN
Honestly Because I thought lying was
worse Lying would mean I’m ashamed to
be with you And that is so far from the
truth I am so proud to be with you -
and I really don’t give a shit what you
do for a living

She looks at him silent He clearly means what hes
saying

JOHN (CONTD)
Melissa we’ve known each other for five
years And I’ve met a lot of women in
those five years But I have always held
each of them up to this imaginary
standard of beauty and wit and grace --
and not one of them has been able to
measure up And then one day I realized -
that standard was not imaginary That
Standard was you I love you And no
one no matter what she does for a
living could ever compare

Melissa looks at him - not sure whether she should smile
or cry She kinda does both

EXT WES’ (and TOBYS) APARTMENT - NIGHT
Wes sits on the patio smoking Toby appears behind him
TOBY
Hey I thought there was strange bald

smoking man loitering on your balcony

WES
Nope Just me

TOBY
I ummm you know I just stopped by to
get some of my stuff

Toby turns to go back inside But stops
1903 64

TOBY (CONTD)
I didnt really come by to get my stuff
I mean partly but not entirely

WES
OK
TOBY
Did we make a mistake
WES
We
TOBY

Me Me - did I fuck it up
Wes looks at her for a very long time

WES
No I dont think you did

This is not the answer that Toby was expecting

TOBY
Really

Wes measures his words

WES
Tob Ive spent the last few days alone
in this house And every spoon or
printer or doorknob has a story - we have
like years of memories packed into every
square inch But the more I thought -
the more I realized that’s all I thought
about - the past And what we had was

perfect For then But it might not be
perfect for now

Toby looks at Wes - he really means this

WES (CONTD)
We grew up together Weve always had
each other But I dont think either of
us ever got to see what it would be like -
what we would be like - if we didn’t have
that

TOBY
Right Thats what I was trying to tell
you before
V4

1903 65

WES
But now you’re going back on it

TOBY
I was getting scared

WES
I‘m scared too

Toby sits down as the two of them silently contemplate

this admission

WES (CONTD)
Toby - I got a job offer today

TOBY
Wow Well god - congratulations God -
that was - fast but -

WES
I don’t want it
TOBY
Well then keep on Look for something
better
WES

TOBY

1903 66

TOBY

WES

WES
They didn’t want to upset you Tob

TOBY
But you dont mind

Wes looks at her and smiles genuinely

WES
Of course I mind But until further
notice you are still the one I’m going
to tell everything to

Toby smiles As they sit in silence Wes hands her the
cigarette and she takes a pull off of it

TOBY
Who are we without each other

Wes takes the cigarette back

WES
I don’t know But we’re about to find
out

Toby gives a smile and lays her head on Wes’ shoulder
INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Melissa lays in bed peacefully asleep We find John
dressed straightening his tie by the foot of the bed

He moves over to Melissa kisses her on the forehead He
then pulls out an ENVELOPE from his jacket pocket and
places it on the nightstand He looks at her one last
time and leaves

As he shuts the door Melissa stirs She turns over to
find John gone and the envelope on the nightstand Her
peacefulness is quickly overtaken by sadness She slowly
reaches over and takes the envelope
1903 67

She opens it warily and pulls out a VELVET POUCH
Curious she reaches in and pulls out a HUGE ENGAGEMENT
RING She grasps it tightly relieved and ecstatic She
lays back down - a smile spreading across her face

INT PAULS HOUSE - NIGHT

A view from outside Paul’s big bay window Inside we can
