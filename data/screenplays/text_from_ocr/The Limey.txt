NOTE THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS
THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THIS SOFT COPY

Wilsons first impression of Los Angeles was blue He was in
the sky at the time so it was a curious reversal looking
down rather than up at the color he had always felt was
natures finest

Swimming pools Hundreds of them Pockmarking the landscape
like miniature lakes A flat landscape of straight streets
and square blocks and sparse grass that didnt look quite
green enough

As far as Wilson could remember he had only ever seen seven
or eight swimming pools in his entire life and they had been
public ones Here everyone had their own Marvellous
There was the one at the Butlins holiday camp where he had
enjoyed his last legitimate employment -- as driver of a tour
bus And there was the one at Crystal Palace he had gone to
once or twice when he was younger He was most familiar
though with the Chelsea Baths as he had lived for some time
in a flat nearby in what he now thought of as his good years
-- before hed gone grey went to prison and found himself in
a plane over a foreign town arriving to avenge the death of
his daughter

WHOOSH The sound of automatic doors opening and --

EXT ARRIVALS TERMINAL LA AIRPORT AFTERNOON

WILSON steps out into the late sunlight and the heat of the
day A slow-motion moment while he gets acclimatized He
wouldnt have ever felt quite this kind of heat before
After such a rigorously air-conditioned interior Or seen
cops wearing guns on their belts Or black cops for that
matter with guns on their belts Or seen people as fat as
Americans on their home turf Things someone from England
notices immediately whether consciously at first or not

CUT

EXT MOTEL EVENING

Wilsons not here for comfort Shown to a shitty room round
the corner of a typical 2nd-level outside walkway Airport
close by

INT MOTEL ROOM EVENING

He draws a curtain open across a window in one strong easy
glide His moves are neat His expressions just as
economical not giving much away Outside the planes are
practically on top of us The sunset colors strange and
chemical

Hes only got one light bag Unzips unpacks a few things
Change of clothes a travel kit and some familiar items
(shaving foamtoothpastedeodorant bearing unfamiliar
British brand names
Goes into the bathroom Turns on the shower in there

Comes back to sit on the bed Takes an envelope out of his
jacket

ENVELOPE
Turns it over to see the return address on the back
CUT

INT TAXI NIGHT

Wilson in the back Stares at the impenetrable name on the
drivers posted ID Glances at the driver

DRIVER glances back at his quiet passenger in the rearview
mirror

CUT

EXT SMALL HOUSE NIGHT

Wilson walks up a cracked little path to the front door
Lower middle-class street Two cars in the driveway one
behind the other Lights on inside the house -- as he rings
the bell

ED RAMA

Answers it Hispanic Late 30s Chairman Mao on his T-
shirt notwithstanding an easygoing sort of fellow Not
looking for any trouble -- anymore But once did and able
to handle himself if any shows up Which it has

WILSON
Edward Rama

ED
Eduardo
(rolling the R)
Rama
WILSON

Youre home then

He turns waves away the taxi hes kept waiting While
Eduardo Rama waits for an introduction

WILSON
My names Wilson
Accent speaks for itself Hard working-class

ED
Wilson

Knows the name But just now its unexpected Hes holding
a hot TV dinner hand protected by a dish towel

WILSON
You wrote to me about my daughter

CUT

INT EDS HOUSE NIGHT

Ed takes Wilson inside

ED
I didnt expect anyone

WILSON

No reason
ED

I mean what has it been -- six months
WILSON

Round about yeah

Theyve entered a cauldron of family life TV blaring
(SHOWBIZ TONIGHT) A couple of younger KIDS yelling Mama
Their MOTHER shouting back at them from the kitchen (in
Spanish) that she only has two hands A sullen TEENAGER
walking by

ED
I didnt even know who I was writing to --
just someone with the same last name
She never talked about any family

WILSON
It was better than a telegram

Ed opens a screen door to the backyard

EXT EDS BACKYARD NIGHT

They sit at an outdoor table Wilson with a TV dinner in
front of him now too Sounds from inside MUTED Even this
little house has a little pool
WILSON
Who done it then

ED
Huh

WILSON
Snuffed her

Ed surprised at Wilsons directness Ed stands nervously

ED
Now wait up a second man

And paces back and forth

ED
I never said nothin about nothin like
that No no no Thats not what I
wrote to you

WILSON
No but between the lines eh
Mysterious circumstances and that

Ed stops pacing

ED
Look I sent you that newspaper clipping
all right I told you what I know It
was an accident I didnt say anything
about anybody being snuffed

Beat

WILSON
This bloke she was bunked up with This
Terry whatsit

ED
Terry Valentine

WILSON
Valentine Whats he got to say for
himself

ED
I dunno Whats he gonna say They had
a fight that night she drove away she
was upset I dont even know the guy
Dont get me wrong Jenny and me were
friends but we didnt travel in the same
social circles She had her life I had
mine

Makes a kind of scoffing gesture and you can see what my
life is

ED
Valentine came into the restaurant where
I work with Jenny a couple times Hes a
money guy Jenny would say hey heres
my friend Eddie and he would shake my
hand and everything but he wouldnt even
see me you know what I mean

Wilson gazes up at the sky Clear night Stars

WILSON
How long had she been in the States
(as if to himself somewhat
wistful)
Near on ten years wasnt it Long
enough to know her way about I reckon

Ed leans down palms on the tabletop facing Wilson

ED
There was an investigation okay The
car was totalled Jennifer was Her
neck was broken On impact they said
So she wouldnt have felt the effects
of the fire

(helpless shrug)

It happens up there Happens a lot
What more can I tell you

Wilson taps out a cigarette from a pack of Silk Cut hes
produced from his pocket

WILSON
What more is there

ED
Im just sayin -- it was a steep
hillside There was no moon that

night
Wilsons quiet stillness is getting to him

ED
Coulda happened to anyone man I never
knew her to be reckless I mean sure
she would smoke a little grass or
something have a few drinks But thats
it nothing more than that

WILSON
No not my girl Self-control she had
Point of pride
(smokes)
And people dont change do they

ED
I dunno Maybe they do

Wilson notes the tattoos on Eds forearms

WILSON
Going straight are ya

Ed looks at him Sits down again Keeping his forearms under
the table

ED
(looks away)
Boomerang

WILSON
Ywhat

ED

I knew when I was droppin that letter
into the mail slot it was gonna come back
and smack me in the face

(looks at Wilson again)
I did my time okay My sister her ol
mans up in Chino right now doin eight
years

WILSON
(re the family inside)
This aint your lot

ED
You kiddin man I dont need a wife
and screamin kids I still got my
youth
And yet -- he lives here Wilson declines to pursue the
matter
ED

I go to work try to keep my life
together put all that shit behind me
man What dyou want from me

WILSON
(calmly smoking)
I only asked

Ed sighs Reaches for one of Wilsons cigarettes
ED

Couple weeks before she died Jennifer
asked me to drive her downtown Said she

was meeting -- her boyfriend --
Valentine But I think she was looking
for him

FLASH CUTS

ED AND JENNIFER In a car downtown She has the same steely
intensity as her father Ed looks a little worried

WILSON
(lighting Eds cigarette)
What tryin to catch him with another
bird
ED
Thats what I thought man But it was
not a hotel or nothin that we went to

It was someplace else

WILSON
Where abouts

FLASH CUTS

JENNIFER Talking to a beefy SUPERVISOR Or talking at him
Either way he isnt happy

MEAT PUPPETS Watch instead of working

ED Taking all this in

ED
Bad place man Bad people Some guys
loading some trucks Some kinda deal

goin down
(anticipating Wilsons next
question)
I dont know and I dont care Maybe
theyre shipping fava beans to Eskimos

WILSON
Did Jenny know

ED

(shrugs)
Valentine wasnt even there If he was
into something if she was involved --
who can say

(stands up again)
But Ill tell you something She stood
in front of these dudes man Eyeballing
them Checking them out

(beat)
I felt like she was covering my ass that
day

Unconsciously rubbing his arms where his tattoos are

ED
I drove her back to Valentines house

FLASH CUT

VALENTINE Standing in front of his house His expression
says We have something to discuss

ED
He was standing outside waiting for her
Thats the only other time I ever saw
him
(a short sad note)
Last time I saw her

He meets Wilsons gaze As hard and pointed as a drill
through his skull

CUT

INT EDS CAR NIGHT

Ed drives Wilson back to his motel Wilson silent Ed still
not quite sure who hes dealing with Is this really or
merely a grieving dad

ED
What you gonna do man You gonna go to
the cops

WILSON

Nah coppers dont do nothing do they

ED
Those streets up in the hills man
Gotta be real careful keep your eye on
the ball Two oclock in the morning
its dark your mind is all agitated
youre drivin a little too fast

(beat)
Those curves dont kid around

Could be talking about the girl Wilson doesnt move But
touch him hell explode Out the window lights are passing
but no landmarks He might as well be on the moon

ED
You should talk to Elaine That was her
best friend

WILSON
She didnt write to me did she

ED
She didnt know what to say
(shrugs)
I thought someone should say something
To someone With me it was I dont know
-- Jenny liked me for some reason I
felt like I owed her

WILSON
Whod Jenny get it off of -- this grass
or whatever

ED
(self-conscious again)
Not me man Im no drug dealer what

WILSON
(re Eds tattoos)
I think you didnt get that lot in the
Navy doing your National Service

ED
I already told you man Corcoran Know
what that is State prison

WILSON

As if resigned and mulling the problem over

ED
Under the table

CUT

INT GUN SHOW DAY

Hundreds of tables Under bright lights Displaying every
kind of firearm Handguns rifles shotguns parts to make
machine guns A weapons bazaar

WILSON AND ED

Walking around Even a cool customer like Wilson cant help
but be impressed by Americas loving embrace of senseless
mayhem

DEALERS

Touting their wares

VISITORS

Trying out pistol grips -- or pushing baby carriages Guys
in fatigue jackets with toddlers on their shoulders Women
in stretch pants looking for a little something in personal
protection

WILSON

Doesnt know where to look At the booth featuring Classic
Cowboy Collectibles -- or the most OBESE COUPLE hes ever
seen who just walked by

PA SYSTEM

shooting panel is due to commence in two
minutes in the blue room at the rear of
the Convention Center

the symbol of death on her

INT EDS CAR DAY

Ed drives Nervous at Wilson handling his new gun purchase
beside him

-- Goin abroad

Ed shakes his head at Wilsons sense of humor
ED

WILSON
Fucking out of order that Shouldnt be

As he puts away a box of ammo

ED

careful This Terry Valentine hes
probably a wonderful fella They were
together how long

ED
Five years I think Long time

WILSON
Well there you are Jen mustve liked
him

Doesnt make Ed feel any better Nor does the way Wilson
seems now to be studying Eds driving techniques Paying
attention to the way traffic lights and left-turn lanes and
cars without clutches work over here

ED
(remembering)
Jenny told me she met him at the beach
Got blinded by his smile
(beat)
You believe that shit Son of a bitch
never smiled at me Buried her at a

private service Private for who
Him
WILSON
(confused)

Hang about I thought you said he come
into the restaurant where you worked with
Jenny

ED
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant
where I work Thats not where they met

WILSON
And thats where you met Jenny

ED
No no -- Jenny used to work as a
waitress Before she met him But
thats not where she met me Not in my
restaurant

WILSON
Howd the two of you hook up then

ED
Oh Jenny was in my acting class

CUT

INT RENTAL CAR DAY

Wilson at the wheel himself Getting the hang of LA
Driving downtown Along one of the major boulevards

Glances at a street sign as he goes by Picks up the map
book on the seat beside him to check his route

EXT BOULEVARD DAY

Wilson makes a sudden lane change to avoid getting fed in the
wrong direction Gets HONKED by another driver

EXT A STREET DOWNTOWN DAY

Wilson cruises past a particular building We dont have to
really clearly see it just yet (we saw it in the flash cuts) --
more important we see him seeing it Casing it with the eyes
of a professional Sniffing it out the instinct of a
predator after prey
INT CAR DAY

Parks it Produces the little leather travel kit we saw him
unpack at his motel Unzips it Under the usual assortment
of clippers razors etc is a hidden layer -- storing still
more personalized items a set of select slim
lockpickingcutting tools

EXT SIDE STREET DAY

Wilson locks the car Walks away STAY with him
AROUND THE CORNER

He walks down the block A nice long walk What we get out
of it besides a sense of Wilson -- cool cat ambling along
loner sun beating down not bothered his shadow doubling
him -- is this

The building approaching The one he has his eye on The
target Its across the street A kind of flat windowless
warehouse with adjoining loading yard Loading yard
surrounded by a chain-link fence -- topped with barbed wire

The actual geography of where he left his car in relation to
this building Safely around the corner And how he might
practically get back to it either this same way or viaa
more circuitous route round another block

The sense you get in downtown LA on a lazy Saturday
afternoon that youre in a ghost town Particularly in this

shabby kind of industrial section

EXT THE BUILDING

Wilson crosses over to it now From sunny to shade

Walks past the chain-link fence The padlocked gate big
enough to accommodate the (couple of) trucks parked within
the compound

Walks past the closed security door which would appear to be
the buildings main entrance

Round the next corner -- SEES theres a steel back door as
well

Comes around this block again Looking surreptitiously around
now Streets here utterly deserted Not even a passing car
Crappy residential building on an opposite corner SPANISH
MUSIC blaring from one of the open windows but not with a
direct view on the loading yard fence on this side Wilson
nearing it now -- taking something out of his pocket One of
the mysterious metallic tools from his travel kit Snaps his
wrist unfolding the tool with a CRACK Wire cutters

He doesnt go for the gate the padlock like we might have
thought He suddenly drops to one knee in shadow where the
fence meets the adjoining building SNAP SNAP SNAP SNAP
SNAP -- so quick with great dexterity though his face
grimaces with the strength he has to exert with each
application of pressure -- he cuts just as many links as he
knows he needs to push in a little flap of fence and roll
under Whole thing accomplished in seconds

LOADING YARD

Walks fast to the cover of the trucks Passes Looks
around Cement loading docks and bays Shuttered doors He
jumps up to one puts his ear to the metal Listens awhile

WILSON

Scans the wall for any sign of an alarm box or anything

Then cocks an ear upwards CAMERA CRANING UP to show us
what he hears an air-conditioning unit HUMMING away Which
means someone must be inside

Wilson looks back at his entry options Not the loading
doors -- but a conventional door at one end with a
conventional lock his eye zeroes in on Gets out his tools
going over

INT WAREHOUSE HALLWAY

A SCRATCHING at the door It opens Hes in
Waits Cautious Nothing He starts along the hallway
INT WAREHOUSE

A SUPERVISOR (the one from the flash cuts) does a double take
as Wilson passes

SUPERVISOR
Hey

Wilson stops and turns Says nothing

SUPERVISOR
Howd you get in here

WILSON
Walked

SUPERVISOR
You walked
(coming over)
What the hell are you doing here

WILSON
Looking for a bloke named Valentine
Know him

MEAT PUPPETS (who we saw before as well) who work here
gathering The Supervisor and the Meat Puppets exchange
glances

SUPERVISOR
Hes expecting you

WILSON
(beat)
I doubt it

The Supervisor moves toward Wilson

SUPERVISOR
So why would he want to see you

WILSON
I have a message for him About Jennifer
Wilson

SUPERVISOR

Jennifer Wilson
More looks are exchanged

WILSON
You know her

SUPERVISOR
Yeah I know her all right She came
down here once stirred up a shitstorm
We lost a full days work took me weeks
to get back on schedule If she hadnt
a been Terrys woman I wouldve broke
her jaw Course shes nobodys problem
now

Wilson stares at him

WILSON
Is Valentine here
SUPERVISOR
What do you think

Wilson looks at the Meat Puppets the loading area

WILSON
Where is he then

SUPERVISOR
Listen get the fuck out of here before
you get hurt Who the fuck do you think
you are waltzing in here asking
questions

Wilson just looks at him

SUPERVISOR
Do you hear me asshole

The Supervisor shoves him The Meat Puppets move a little in
anticipation Wilson isnt giving any indication that hes

going to leave

SUPERVISOR
Jesus you really want your ass kicked
dont you

He pushes Wilson again hard

SUPERVISOR
Go on get outta here

He pushes Wilson again Still Wilson wont leave

SUPERVISOR
Fuckin nut Go on

This time he tries to slap Wilson Wilson blocks the
Supervisors hand and then punches him hard The Supervisor

stumbles back and falls to the floor

THE MEAT PUPPETS

Move to Wilson He tries to fend them off but there are too
many They beat him When they find that hes armed they
beat him harder

CUT

EXT BUILDING DAY

Wilson is taken outside and dumped After a moment he gets
to his feet Dusting himself Reaches for ANOTHER GUN tucked
in his lower back He re-enters the building

A beat We hear several SHOTS

Seconds later one of the Meat Puppets comes stumbling out of
the door terrified He runs past us fast

A moment later Wilson emerges gun in hand

WILSON
You tell him You tell him Im coming

CUT

INTEXT VALENTINES HOUSE DUSK

A series of images that prove Valentine (whoever he is) has
taste wealth and influence stretching back a good three
decades at least

Walking through some of these shots is a young beauty in a
bathing suit named ADHARA She advances slowly not entirely
sure of herself and stops to look at things just like we do
At one point she looks to see a BEEFY GUY (GORDON) sitting at
the kitchen counter flipping through a magazine He looks
her up and down more from reflex than anything

She continues on Eventually she emerges through sliding
glass doors and on to a patio

HER POV

A figure by the pool talking on the phone His back to us
The pool is spectacular mosaic tile bottomed

ADHARA

Approaches then sits beside him His voice is soothing but
with the tiniest hint of exasperation that comes with being
slightly ahead of everyone

VALENTINE
(into phone)
Not before Not before Think about it
What does it mean What -- no Im not
Think Yes See You figured it out
all by yourself I know Are we done
Okay

He hangs up stands still doesnt turn
VALENTINE
Adhara I told your father if youre
looking for a name you cant go wrong
with a constellation

ADHARA
I used to hate it Now I like it

VALENTINE
Could be worse he couldve named you
Reticulum

He turns and we see him for the first time
VALENTINE

Polished Handsome Charismatic Especially when hes
smiling like he is now He leans over and kisses her

VALENTINE
Is there anything in the world that you
want or need

ADHARA
I want to know why you need that scary
guy in your house

VALENTINE
Gordon Hes been with me for years
Hes not as tough as he looks

ADHARA
Then what good is he

VALENTINE
Is it possible that youre too young to
be acquainted with the idea of loyalty

ADHARA
Is that a problem

VALENTINE
Not for you clearly

ADHARA
Im loyal to things that make me happy

VALENTINE
Am I a thing

ADHARA
Well youre certainly not a person

VALENTINE
Im not
ADHARA
No Youre not specific enough to be a
person Youre more like a vibe
VALENTINE

Im so glad were having this chat

ADHARA
Its not a knock

VALENTINE
Its not a compliment

ADHARA
Its an observation Like Im hungry
When are we eating

VALENTINE
As soon as you get dressed

ADHARA
What kind of food

VALENTINE
Anything but Japanese

ADHARA
Why

VALENTINE

Buffets Salad bars

ADHARA

VALENTINE

distractions
ADHARA
For some eating is a sensual experience
The sensual experience

VALENTINE
Thats what Gordons always saying

ADHARA
Oh god

His cell phone rings
VALENTINE

(into phone)
Yes

He listens then looks up at his balcony where a MAN (AVERY)
stands holding a phone obviously talking to Valentine

VALENTINE
(into phone)

He hangs up

VALENTINE (contd)
We can leave as soon as youre ready

CUT

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING EVENING

ELAINE on her way in Handsome woman Intelligent capable-
looking Passes Wilson whos leaning somewhere smoking

ELAINE

Aware as a wary woman will be of a strange mans presence
without necessarily having looked at him Well aware too
that he stayed where he was -- so she unworriedly unlocks the
buildings security gate and goes through to the inner --

COURTYARD

-- and closes the gate behind her now seeing him amble up
arriving as it CLICKS shut between them Hes looking at her
a certain way She looks back And knows

ELAINE
Youre Jennys father

And the recognition on his part

WILSON
Had a feeling it was you

ELAINE
You look alike

WILSON
(cigarette in hand)
Perhaps it was the smoke

ELAINE
Not her brand

WILSON
She used to pinch em off me
(trying to defuse Elaines cold
stare)
Funny that One thing she never tried to
get me to stop

Elaine doesnt soften

ELAINE
Why did you come here

WILSON
Wanted to talk to you didnt I

ELAINE
No why did you come here

America

WILSON
Sort a few things out

ELAINE
Been busy have you

WILSON
How dyou mean

ELAINE
Its been a while

WILSON
I was skint -- didnt have no money to
get here

ELAINE

Thats not what I heard

WILSON
What was that then

ELAINE
I heard you were -- whats that adorable
phrase -- at Her Majestys pleasure
WILSON

It was the bars then

Indicating his face viewed by Elaine through the barred
security gate that divides them

ELAINE
In any case I dont suppose the salary
you make sewing mailbags is really
commensurate with international airline
travel

WILSON
Sewing mailbags Me Never did an
honest days work in my life dear
Wasnt about to start when I was in stir --
not with all that leisure time on my
hands

ELAINE
And not with all that buried loot you had
waiting for you when you got out From
the Wembley Staduim job wasnt it Pink
Floyd concert receipts Jenny wouldve
been fourteen at the time

WILSON
(trying to conceal his
surprise)
Hardly buried Earning interest love
Earning interest in an offshore account
Tidy little premium per annum that

ELAINE
Well that kind of security cant be
bought Must be more comforting than a
daughter to greet you

She turns to walk away

WILSON
Here arent you gonna let me in

ELAINE
(without looking back)
Try calling me again

INT ELAINES APARTMENT EVENING

She comes in A modest studio apartment Puts her bag on
the kitchenette countertop Glances at her answer machine to
see if she has any messages The phone RINGS She sits down
glumly on her couch holds her head in her hands

EXT ELAINES APARTMENT BUILDING EVENING

Wilson gives up starts to walk away The gate BUZZES

INT ELAINES APARTMENT EVENING

Elaine opens the door Wilson in the hall
ELAINE
I was just going to toss some vegetable
rolls in the microwave open a can of
diet soda
(beat)
Want to take me out

CUT

INT RESTAURANT NIGHT

Wilson and Elaine at a table

WILSON
No I went in for more improving
pastimes Philosophy classes language

courses European history all that lark
Did you know that in Paris in the
Eighteenth Century there were more rats
in peoples houses than there were people
in peoples houses

ELAINE
Sounds like Beverly Hills

WILSON
Here are you always this sarky

ELAINE
Sarcastic moi Maybe Ill mellow when
my ship comes in Its expected any day

WILSON
Werent you on a television series

ELAINE
(has he seen it)
If it played in England somebody owes me
money Who told you that -- Eddie

WILSON

(yes)
Said it went on for donkeys years

ELAINE
Three seasons They found thats the
limit of human tolerance when it comes to
following the adventures of a family of
Mormons on the Chisum Trail
(blinks coquettishly)
I was wife number three -- the ingenue

WILSON
Oh it just ended then

ELAINE
Now whos being sarcastic

WILSON
When youve lost as many years as I have
love puts things in perspective know
what I mean

ELAINE
Im sorry I guess the rest of us have
no excuse for wondering where the time
went
(raises her drink)
It mustve been the bars

Their food arrives

ELAINE

Its a kind of prison doing a series
Early to bed early to rise no time off
for good behavior you grab the boodle
for as long as it lasts

(the kicker)
Only difference is you cant get arrested
afterwards

Wilson appears fascinated by the cold glasses of water on the
table Ice cubes CLINKING as he holds his A BUSBOY
bringing them to other people too just like that without
anyone even asking

WILSON
I cant believe Jenny told you all that
About me She was always so embarrassed

ELAINE
Not embarrassed

WILSON
(correcting)
Ashamed
ELAINE

Not ashamed

Wilson looks at her Okay What then
ELAINE
Disappointed

WILSON
She never told Eddie though

ELAINE
She never told anyone else
(making light now)
About the convict strain -- or is it
stain No I was privileged I was
someone who helped Jenny efface her past

WILSON
Howd you manage that then

ELAINE
When Im not honing my craft in episodic
television I do double-duty as a voice
coach Not that her accent would have
hobbled her progress Not with that
look

WILSON
Yeah well she started all that in
London

ELAINE
Modelling

WILSON

Learnin ow to speak proper

At seventeen They offered her a place
at RADA n all only shedve had to wait
till the next session and she was always
in hurry to get on was Jenny She could
talk posh without any training when she
was knee-high to a grasshopper

(indicating himself)
Show up the old man you know

Elaine smiles slightly None of this information new to her
But warming to this man

ELAINE
You werent disappointed in her then

WILSON
In Jenny Course not How could I be
Course I wasnt

ELAINE
She was twenty-one when she came to me
(looks at him)
Straight from leaving you

WILSON
Footloose and fancy free

ELAINE
She was happy here However the two of
you might have parted Dont think she
wasnt

Its because Wilson thinks the opposite that hes here
Looks at Elaine

WILSON
Thats the trouble n it
(hard as nails again)
She enjoyed life

Well dont suppose she did really most
of her life On her own after her mum
died Aunts and uncles for a time -- and
then the bright lights beckoned

ELAINE
Were you still married at the time -- to
Jennys mother I mean

WILSON

Elaine pauses

ELAINE
Some word

Wilson leans on the wall overlooking the black ocean Sound
of WAVES gently lapping the beach

WILSON

was it supposed to have happened -- two

oclock in the morning Eddie said

ELAINE
(watching him)

They come in

ELAINE
Make yourself at home Steal something

That gets her a look

ELAINE
Theres nothing I cant afford to lose

She goes to make coffee Wilson looks around

ELAINE
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is

WILSON
Well I gathered something from the
article what Eddie sent me Some sort of
pop music producer wasnt it

Maybe a smile from Elaine at the quaintness of pop music

ELAINE

Rock n roll is what we called it Hes
sort of a forgotten figure now but back
when the West Coast was the grooviest
place on earth Terry Valentine was where
all the happenings happened More of a
kind of promoter I guess whatever that
means Just took that whole Southern
California Sixties Zeitgeist and ran with
it Packaged and sold it Made out like
a bandit
FLASH CUTS

VALENTINE At home Watching as Adhara undresses either
deliberately for him or just casually She smiles as she
notices hes looking

WILSON
Whats he done lately

That line pregnant with meaning Elaine looks at him
Avoids answering the question actually implied there

ELAINE
(brings a tray over)
Lives high off the hog and waits for the
next big thing Like me -- but ona
grander scale of failure

WILSON
Now you shouldnt run yourself down My
employer Mr Lindgren --

EXT HILLSIDE UNDERBRUSH LATE AFTERNOON

Thickets part and we SEE Wilson scrambling up a rather steep
hill Coming to a ridge where he settles down to look at
something OS His expression changes by degrees from
curiosity to dawning realization to a kind of frustrated
disappointment

INT WILSONS CAR (ON THE ROAD BELOW) LATE AFTERNOON

Ed sits in here RADIO on Wilson appears out of the brush
gets in Ed turns the radio down

ED
(mindful of the odd car driving
past)
Told you you wouldnt be able to see

Watch it

As one of the bodyguards runs by only fleetingly glimpsed
by us

ED

CUT
EXT VALENTINES HOUSE LATE AFTERNOON

Wilsons car pulls up He and Ed get out Wilson engages in
a mini tug-of-war with a Valet over his car key it so rubs
him the wrong way having to give it up

WILSON
Keep it handy mate all right Were
not stopping long

He gestures apparently getting the message across that he
wants the car kept close by

VALET
Yes sir
WILSON
Cheers
Exchanges the key for a card -- which he turns over in his

hand and studies curiously as they head inside

WILSON
Valets eh Arent we all la-de-da

ED

VALENTINE
Hmm

ADHARA

Is lounging in the large tub Staring dreamily at a couple
of framed posters on the walls more 60s psychedelia

ADHARA
That you have down at your office

Valentine sits on the edge of the tub With a nostalgic air
as he looks at her the embodiment of youth

VALENTINE
Different ones

He strokes her wet skin They kiss lightly

ADHARA
I like the colors

VALENTINE
We all did

ADHARA
It mustve been a time A golden moment

Beat
VALENTINE
Have you ever dreamed of a place you
dont really recall ever having been
to a place that probably doesnt even

exist except in your imagination
somewhere far away half-remembered when

you wake up but when you were there you
spoke the language you knew your way
around

(significant pause)
That was the 60s

With that exit line (practiced) he starts to go
Then pauses turns again

VALENTINE
No it wasnt Wasnt either

Comes back to her Faraway look in his eyes

VALENTINE
It was 66 early 67
(comes back to now)
That was all

He goes

INT VALENTINES HOUSE DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY AFTERNOON

Wilson wanders around exploring the house Comes to a wall
of photographes Casually scanning them as he passes slowly
by hes caught up short by one

POV

A framed photo of JENNY his daughter

A series of emotions play over his face He turns -- SEES
Valentine coming down the stairs Valentine joins the party
without noticing him

BY THE BUFFET TABLE

Ed peruses the available food Valentine comes over to check
it out Glances at Ed without recognizing him
VALENTINE
Hi

INT MASTER BATHROOM

Adhara is still enjoying her bath

INT MASTER BEDROOM

Wilson enters Careful Aware that someones in the adjoining

even glimpses her through the door as he boldly looks around
He notices a video camera on a tripod a cord running to the
television Suddenly we hear the CHIRP of a cellular phone

BATHROOM

Adhara reacts

ADHARA
Shit

She gets out of the tub and goes for the nearest towel
Quickly wrapping herself she exits

Adhara enters and goes for her purse She pulls the RINGING
phone out and answers it

ADHARA
Hello Hey Great You got my message
Yeah No Crestview Terrace not
Crestview Place Yeah theres like three
different ways up the hill the quick way
is to bear to the right Sure Okay
Okay Bye

She hangs up and begins toweling her hair After a moment
she stops Something isnt right She looks around the
room and her eyes stop on the TV Her brow furrows trying
to place the familiar image on the screen a girl towel-
drying her hair by the bed
ADHARA
Thats me

She looks over to see the video camera which has been turned
on and pointed toward the bed Shes not sure if its funny

or creepy

The Guy leaves Wilson sees that Adhara is now on the other
side of the room separated from Valentine He heads for

VALENTINE

Still dealing with people desperate to be the focus of his
attention He notices

WILSON AND ADHARA
Talking in a corner She seems attentive
VALENTINE

In a SERIES OF CUTS still being the gracious host still
keeping his eyes on

WILSON AND ADHARA

Who in a SERIES OF CUTS continue to talk Finally they
separate Wilson heading outside onto a deck

VALENTINE

Excuses himself from a group of sycophants and goes to her
ADHARA

Valentine approaches and begins talking to her low After a
few moments of conversation they both look toward

WILSON

On the deck outside Joining Ed whos taken refuge out here
with a plate of food What Wilson cant belleve when he SEES
it -- is that behind Valentines house which is on top of a
high hill is nothing but desolate scrub canyon On the other
side of the railing around the deck which is surely less

than regulation height is a sheer drop into an abyss

WILSON (contd)
(jumps back with only slightly
affected vertigo)
Flipping heck

Ed a little more accustomed to LA architecture nods in
agreement

ED
If you could afford a house like this you
would buy a house like this
Wilson edges forward to the rail again

WILSON
What are we standing on

ED
Faith

They stand there looking out Quite a view once you get used
to it Breeze

ED (contd)
(nods to the hazy distance)
You could see the sea from here if you
could see it

WILSON
Could you

But now Ed gives Wilson a nudge -- SEEING that Valentine
inside the house is making his way out here

WILSON
Why dont you go nick one of those little
cooker whats its warming up the sausages
cocktail and meet me in the garage Look
about for a toolbox while youre at it

Ed considers His is not to reason why

ED
Okay

Ed moves off Valentine steps up smile fully loaded

VALENTINE
Hi Terry Valentine

to it begins going through the contents

WILSON
Put the Sterno on the ground near the
center of the garage

Ed does Wilson pulls a brace-and-bit from the toolbox and
crosses to the rear of one of the cars Dropping to the
ground he bores a hole in the gas tank Ed raises his
eyebrows and moves toward the door Wilson crosses to the
other car and puts a hole in that gas tank as well Then he
puts the brace-and-bit back in the toolbox and heads for the
exit Ed right behind him giving a quick backward glance

looking around He stops as he sees Wilson once again
stepping onto the deck He points Wilson out to Gordon who
nods and heads for the deck

EXT VALENTINES HOUSE AFTERNOON

Ed hands the ticket to a Valet He exchanges looks with a
couple of the other Valets

INT VALENTINES HOUSE DOWNSTAIRS AFTERNOON

Valentine is talking to Adhara who is introducing her
Girlfriend As Valentine greets her he glances outside
where Gordon is approaching Wilson on the deck

EXT DECK

Wilson SEES Gordon approaching Gets ready to greet him
Removes cigarette from mouth drops it to floor of deck
presses it out under his shoe Limbers up his shoulders ina
subtle way

Gordon coming towards him As if to challenge Wilsons
legitimacy as an invited guest Closer About to speak

But Wilson doesnt even give him a chance to do that In
quick succession Wilson HEAD BUTTS Gordon splintering his
nose KNEES him in the groin then using the knee for
leverage grabs Gordon by the lapels -- and heaves him over
the railing

It happened so fast that if anyone else is nearby they
probably didnt even notice -- or didnt readily grasp what
they saw

INT VALENTINES HOUSE

Valentine had turned his attention back to Adhara and her
Girlfriend When he glances back to the deck hes a little
concerned not to see Gordon anywhere out there anymore --
just Wilson coming back in

WILSON

Adjusting his jacket walking back through the house Behind
him people are rushing to the railing and looking over A
few yells of Call an ambulance etc are heard

VALENTINE

Moves that way

WILSON
Moving across the room towards the front door They are
heading right toward each other

WILSON AND VALENTINE

Pass each other eyes locked almost dream-like Wilsons
eyes cold though with the hint of a smile Valentine throws
a last look back before reaching the deck

EXT DECK

Valentine pushes through to look over the railing

HIS POV

Gordon -- a crumpled inert heap way down the hill below

VALENTINE

Turns to look toward the front door Wilson not to be seen
Valentine pushes through the crowd toward the door

EXT VALENTINES HOUSE AFTERNOON

Valentine emerges in time to see Ed and Wilson pulling away
Wilson looks at him impassive through the passenger window

AVERY

Is just arriving in his car Valentine gestures at him
Suddenly we HEAR a loud bass-heavy WHHUUUMMMPPP

Valentine (and a few others) turn toward the sound which
came from

THE GARAGE
There is smoke coming from under the door

EXT CANYON ROAD AFTERNOON

Wilsons car practically tobogganing back down the hill
BOOM We hear an explosion from back UP the hill

INT WILSONS CAR

Ed jumps -- though hes driving The gas pedal his most
pressing concern Negotiating the dangerously winding road
comes second Exhilaration mixed with panic

WILSON
Steady on
ED
You steady on man What the fuck else
did you do back there
EXT ROAD
An especially sharp curve looms ahead
WILSON
Flinches grabs a handhold
CURVE
Car makes it around on two side wheels
WILSON
Gulps

WILSON
Bloody hell

Ed regains control

AVERY

In his car takes a different turn

EXT ROAD CAR

Swerves some more curves Should be some sense here that a
similar skyline route would have been taken by Wilsons

daughter on her final drive

INT WILSONS CAR

ED
Why didnt you just kill him you had the
chance

WILSON

That would be too easy

ED
Too easy

WILSON
Hes gotta know why
ED
You think a fuckin guy like that ever
will What more do you want man

Suddenly out of nowhere -- (a side street) -- BAM -- another
car shoots out to cut them off sideswiping them

EXT ROAD

Wilsons car SKIDS into a spin from the impact

THE OTHER CAR

Its Avery Chased them via a shortcut down the mountain
Now jumps out of his car levels a shotgun at them and pumps
off a BLAST

WILSONS CAR

BAM -- the trunk pops open as the car rights itself Avery
FIRES again but the upended trunk is a kind of shield

deflecting the shot

INT WILSONS CAR

Despite the fact that Ed is still in the drivers seat (and
managed rather skillfully to avoid crashing) -- Wilson acts
like hes not there grabs the steering wheel jams the car
into reverse virtually sitting on Ed as he pounds his own
foot onto the gas pedal -- and with his ferocious eyes
monitoring the door-mirror steamrolls the car backwards
towards Avery

EXT ROAD

Wilson reverses his car like a speeding tank SMASHING into
Averys car Pushing it right off the edge of the road

AVERY

Falls backwards to the ground as he gets the hell out of the
way

WILSON

Jumps out of his car Gun drawn Advancing on Avery with it
pointed

AVERYS CAR

CRASHING through underbrush down the steep bank of the
hillside
WILSONS FACE

SOUND of the divebombing car OVER Another pointed echo of
his daughters fate

AVERY

Their eyes meet momentarily And before Wilson can shoot
Avery rolls over the edge of the road himself

ED
Calls frantically to Wilson from their car

ED
Cmon man Cmon

SIRENS in the distance
WILSON

That consuming rage overtaken him again for a second But
the exigencies of the moment snap him out of it

WILSON

Turns on a dime goes back to the car Before hes halfway
in Eds driving them away again Trunk at the back BANGING
up and down up and down

AVERY

Pulls himself back up to the road Brushing himself off
Looking the way they went

He gently tosses his shotgun down into some thick brush where
maybe hell retrieve it later

EXT VALENTINES HOUSE AFTERNOON

Avery returns sweating walking back up the road to where
all the action is Party guests milling outside waiting for
their cars so they can leave A fire truck a police car
SMOKE pouring out of Valentines garage

Valentine finishes talking to a couple of COPS Walks over to
Avery

AVERY
You should have let me do the talking
VALENTINE
Why because youre my security
consultant
(insecure)
This cocksucker nearly burnt my house
down

AVERY
(more concerned about police
presence)
What did you tell them

Valentine blows air runs a hand through his hair

VALENTINE
I told them a long-time employee flipped
out Had a drug problem refused

counselling Set the garage on fire
then committed suicide One of my
guests tried to stop him -- but how do
you stop Gordon

In this context meaning how did that rangy Englishman do it

VALENTINE
I mean Gordon must weigh a good four
hundred pounds

AVERY
Heavier than that now But are there any
drugs in that stomach to back up your

story

VALENTINE
As it happens I didnt make that part
up

AVERY

And where is this guest Dont they want
to interview him

VALENTINE
I dont know everyone here He was so
traumatized he split
(another notion)
Maybe he was Gordons pusher

Avery stares at Valentine Impressed at him thinking on his
feet

VALENTINE
Where do you think he is Mike
AVERY
(already turning)
Well find him

VALENTINE
(stops him)
No I mean Not even your people should
be involved Right Its too close now

AVERY
You could use a few of my prime
shitkickers up here

VALENTINE
You think Im staying

AVERY
Theres already gonna be talk about how
people close to you keep falling into
canyons

VALENTINE
Well can we make it one more Nowhere
the fuck near me

Hes being glib but hes being serious His open-handed
gesture inquiring of Avery are you up to the task

AVERY
I have other resources

He turns to go

INT POOL HALL NIGHT

Two characters stand leaning against a back wall Staring
ahead without purpose Halfheartedly watching a game of
pool in progress Just hanging out Strange threatening
characters One of them is young Lean hungry-looking
STACY is his name A shrewd scheming kid But definitely a
little unhinged Weirder is his companion UNCLE JOHN The
title isnt one of courtesy Hes an actual blood relative
Maybe 25 years older than Stacy But intellectually younger
Physically much bigger The man is huge Nevertheless the
safer of the two -- until Stacy tells him otherwise Way
theyre standing next to each other suggests the ease they
feel in each others company Tight bond Theyre good
buddies

AVERY

Walks in Stops to look around Spots his two freaks
Walks toward them

A mysterious black man has followed Avery in THOMPSON is
his name He hangs back and watches

AVERY
Makes contact

AVERY
Stacy

Stacy turns to see him Uncle John looks vacantly
STACY
(bored)
Hey

AVERY
Come over here

That was in the way of an order He nods around the corner
where its less crowded Stacy stops Uncle John from
following and goes after Avery

THOMPSON

At the bar Keeping his eye on them
AVERY

Speaks softly Alone with Stacy

AVERY
How they goin kid

STACY
Not bad

AVERY
Howd you like to kill someone for me

STACY

AVERY
See a successful man like me has
limitations -- I lose touch at a street

INT WILSONS MOTEL NIGHT

Wilson on the bed Watching TV (ACCESS HOLLYWOOD) KNOCK
at door He turns down the TV Takes a 45 from the springs
under the bed Looks carefully through the peephole in the
door

Opens it Elaine has come to visit Lets her in After
closing the door resumes his position on the bed

Elaine looks around

ELAINE
I was in the neighborhood I come down
here quite a bit Watch the planes
taking off
(re this motel)
Study the architecture of early David
Lynch

But she doesnt really have it in her to be ironic right now
Leans back against the door

Wilson remains silent Hes done the same to Elaine now that
he did to Ed Almost magically induced her to a confessional
verge

Elaine too isnt sure she wants to be complicit in this
revenge tragedy But here goes
ELAINE
Jenny was supposed to come to my place
that night She called me asked if she
could come over She and Terry had been
-- having some trouble Lately I dont
know about what On this occasion it
reached some sort of crisis point

WILSON
She told you all about my details but not
about his Lovely

ELAINE
Shed never called me like that before
She sounded more pissed off -- angry --

than upset or afraid But she never
turned up I called the house but only
got the answer machine When they found
her shed been going the wrong way
Not the direction shed have gone if

shed been coming to see me Or coming
straight to see me Who knows Maybe she
just wanted to drive

She looks at Wilson Shrugs Thats it Thats all Isnt
it

WILSON
(measured)
How did you come to have my address
Found it did you Among her things

ELAINE
You think Terry gave me access to her
things Probably sold her clothes

WILSON
(gently urging)
And how did you get it

Elaine looks at him

ELAINE
She gave me your address

Wilson nods

ELAINE (contd)

(starting to realize)
Not long before
(realizing)
She said if anything ever happened
(realizes)
Thats how you know Thats why youre
so sure
(realization)
Jennys telling you

INT WILSONS ROOM

Wilson and Elaine Getting dressed Shes in pantyhose
Fastening a bra Hes got trousers on reaching for a shirt

WILSON
How longve you lived here

Elaine sits on the bed fastening her skirt Her bra strap
cuts across her bare back

ELAINE
This towns been chewing my flesh
since what we now refer to as the
early 70s

(thinks back)
Christ my past became nostalgia and no
one even asked me

WILSON
Early 70s I was away
(tries to remember)
Maidstone Possibly Brixton

ELAINE
These more highlights from the Zagat
prison guide

Wilson looks at her shes the one who goes to bed with ex-
cons

WILSON
You dont seem bothered

ELAINE
You dont know how Ive compromised my
standards

WILSON
Tell us about it

ELAINE
Its too involved a lifetime of non-
involvement Anywhere else Id be an
interesting little number here Im just
SAG number forty-eight thousand and one
(quickly)
SAG meaning Screen Actors Guild

WILSON
Oh I was gonna say
ELAINE
Still there have been rewards Its
sunny And some of the producers who
call even have credits

WILSON
I can see the attraction

She glances up at him to try and see how he means that
he looking at her or out the window

ELAINE
What did you do To make them take the
early 70s away from you

WILSON
A jewellers up the West End We
tunnelled our way under the shop floor
from the public lavatory down the road
Filthy work Trouble was the bloody
thing collapsed -- after wed made the
grab n all Would you Adam n Eve it

ELAINE
You mean if theyd nabbed you before you
actually broke and entered you would only
have been charged with making a mess

WILSON
We were lucky to be nicked Me and the
lads went down there Sunday evening we
werent discovered till the Monday Good
job we were still breathing

ELAINE
It didnt discourage you though

WILSON
Hey

ELAINE
From pursuing your chosen profession

WILSON
Ill tell ya something it made me a
model prisoner Put me right off any
escape attempts Tunnel my way to
freedom after that experience Not
bloody likely

ELAINE
He stands

I was inside once I punched a cop at a
demo

WILSON
Did you What was that in aid of

Who remembers

WILSON
Get seven years did you

ELAINE
Overnight What about just now

WILSON
Just now
(playful goes over ready for
more)
Overnight

ELAINE
You have been away
(lies back regards him
carefully)
Or is all this just new to you

WILSON
Its true Has to be said I got off to
a slow start

ELAINE
I dont believe it

WILSON
Honest Didnt know where to look till I
was 21

ELAINE
Pushing the legal limit even then

again vaguely disappointing her

WILSON
Me mate introduced me to a woman up the
street Funnily enough she was married
to a milkman Straight up I said
Good is she Been around He said
Good Listen mush its not that shes
been around its that shes been around
hell of a long time

He laughs uproariously at that But the point is hes sort
of complimenting both Elaine and himself Theyve been
around had their knocks theyve lasted Elaine remains
unsmiling

Still leaning back on her elbows on the bed in bra skirt

hose no shoes She asks again the question Wilson avoided
answering
ELAINE
Your most recent incarceration What was
that for

And again he evades the answer she wants

WILSON
t was for nine years
(buttoning his shirt)
The last nine years

EXT PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY MORNING

For the first time we see the Pacific coastline Impressive

And a sleek Italian sports car Heading north
INT SPORTS CAR
Valentine at the wheel Adhara besides him

ADHARA
Ive lived in LA all my life Ive
never done this drive

VALENTINE
All your life That happened while I
swam the length of my pool

Adhara looks back over her shoulder Checking the road
behind

VALENTINE
Whats the matter

ADHARA
Nothing I guess its hard to pass on
this road

VALENTINE
The freeways faster but lacks a certain
majesty

ADHARA
Just feels like the car behind has been
following us the longest time

VALENTINE
I sure hope so

INT THE CAR BEHIND

A big utility vehicle With Avery in the front passenger
seat And three bodyguards hes brought along to protect
Valentine RICK driving TOM and LARRY in the back

TOM
All Im sayin is travel time shouldnt
be the same rate Travel time is down
time right I mean were not even in
the same car as the client

(to Avery)

You told me the job was at the house

When we get to it Well are we shadowing
the client right now or are we just going
the same way The company I was with in
Seattle these distinctions were made
Now I dont dispute him getting the full
whack

(he means Rick whos older)
Seniority and all that But if Im
getting paid the same hourly rate when
were at the house as I am in this car
that doesnt sit well with me and I feel
obliged to say so Cause in Seattle
what youre paying now for so-called
travel time was half what we got for
actual clock-time with the client So I
just feel we should get more when the job
actually commences

After this spineless whining weak-willed sob story Larry
just turns to him and says

LARRY
Id really like to eat your pussy

EXT ELAINES NEIGHBORHOOD DAY

Stacy and Uncle John sitting on a bench in a beach setting

just staring at someone)

beachgoers)

skulls doesnt it

STACY

Looks like they just airbrushed the dick

Life sure is a minefield

Because that wasnt anything to do with
me And suspicion has been cast in my

SUSAN
Surely you can think of somewhere else to
take one of your chippies for a quick
getaway
VALENTINE
Susan

He actually puts his hands on her arms To hold her firm
while he locks onto her eyes And doesnt smile

VALENTINE (contd)
I just need somewhere remote Away

telling her this house because of the connection to him is
a target of some kind

SUSAN
Its been five minutes and Im packing to
leave again I cant believe this

VALENTINE
Thats right your life is Shit and Im
to blame Its that simple

That does it Susan turns on him

SUSAN

It is that simple I blame you for
everything Losing inhibitions and
chicks without bras didnt have to lead
to hardcore porno in every American
household that was you The first on
your block to turn on a camera in a hot
tub and peddle it to your friends A
little recreational pot didnt inevitably
have to lead to the eventual devastation
of the inner cities you made that
happen the first time you bought a
bigger stash than you yourself meant to
smoke It happened when you made your
first buck hyping some so-called event
that was over before it began or marketed
some product whose only value was its
instant disposability You were the
first person to see there was a lot of
money to be made selling Navajo rugs --
youve even stolen from the fucking
Indians You looked at Charlie Manson
when all he had to show for himself was a
guitar instead of a knife and saw another
merry prankster the freedom of the
frontier Your pal here --

(Avery)
-- He saw gated communities Rich people
coming to him with their money terrified

of what people like you had left of this
society Why invest in a marriage and
children when you had him Hes your
oracle But you couldnt even trust in
friendship could you Still hes the
dog you call for its dinner Because
everything that might once have been fun
or nice or sweet you had to turn mean and
cold and sour That was your genius
Terry Havent you read your own press

Where are you going

WILSON

Standing there Wet Mad He grabs Valentine by the shirt
and pushes him back into the room

VALENTINE

Bounces off the couch and onto the floor
WILSON

Comes toward him

VALENTINE

Grabs a lamp off an end table and hurls it at Wilson It
careens off Wilsons arm and shatters

WILSON
Is almost on him now
VALENTINE

Tries to scramble away Throwing anything he can get his
hands on at
WILSON

Who keeps coming He grabs Valentine pulls him up then
throws him into the television

VALENTINE

Crashes into the TV face first and bounces to the floor

Goes to him grabs him by the neck with one hand and pulls
out his gun with the other He seems about to speak when

suddenly he screams instead

WILSON
AAAAGGGGHHHH

ADHARA
Has just stuck a kitchen knife into Wilsons back
WILSON

Turns instinctively and whips the pistol around smashing
Adhara in the mouth

ADHARA
Hits the ground She wont be retaliating
WILSON

In agony spinning trying to reach the knife in his back
but ITS JUST BEYOND HIS REACH

VALENTINE
Scrambles through the sliding glass door

EXT BIG SUR HOUSE BACK PORCH NIGHT

Valentine stumbles out Notices Avery slumped on the deck
mortally wounded Goes to him -- as if concerned -- but
actually just to take the gun Then runs off the porch
toward the STEPS that lead down to the sea

WILSON

Comes out after him the knife still in his back So intent
on catching Valentine he fails at first to notice Avery lying
in the shadows
AVERY

Has just barely managed to reach Stacys pistol Raises it
weakly Points it at Wilson

WILSON

Seems to feel it Turns Locks eyes with Avery Avery
could already have shot him But theres a momentary sense of
recognition both of them just foot soldiers for fat cats --
and Averys is not worth saving

AVERY

Lowers the gun Nods in the direction Valentine went

AVERY
that way

Wilson moves on Avery just lies there presumably to die

EXT BIG SUR HOUSE STEPS NIGHT

Valentine hurries down the rickety steps Trying not to slip
in the darkness though there are tiny Malibu lights
illuminating the steep and winding wooden framework

EXT BEACH NIGHT

A rocky cove Valentine looks back up the way he came
HEARING the FOOTSTEPS coming down after him Backs away a
few paces on the slippery rocks Falls

Lands on the crumpled dead body of LARRY the bodyguard who
was thrown off the cliff Valentine recoils When Wilson
appears Valentine FIRES at him A wild shot that only makes

Wilson duck momentarily Valentine scrambles to his feet
runs on

WILSON

Jumps down from the steps Stops for a moment and leans his
back against the railing Bends at the knees slightly

THE KNIFE
The handle is forced upward just enough to be reachable now

WILSON
Grimacing pulls the knife out and discards it
FURTHER DOWN THE BEACH

Valentine runs Or tries to Its dark and the ground is
treacherous The beach runs out pretty soon Now just
rocks Maybe he thought he could get around the rocks on the
point at the other end But he cant see very far ahead

And the tide is in water making any escape extremely
difficult He tries to scramble over some rocks Theyre
wet slippery He falls cries out as he literally breaks an
ankle

WILSON

A dark figure Coming into focus Walking inexorably this
way

VALENTINE

Painfully rights himself A small bone protrudes from his
broken ankle He FIRES at Wilson gun in one hand other
hand gripping his wrist to try and steady it Doing his best
to aim But the SHOTS miss their mark

WILSON

Steadily coming

VALENTINE

Out of bullets now Gun CLICKING crazily on empty He
simply drops it

WILSON

Now stands before him
THE TWO OF THEM

Both breathing hard

WILSON
Tell me

This is not what Valentine expected

VALENTINE
What

WILSON
Tell me
VALENTINE
Tell you

WILSON

About Jenny

(closer)
Tell me about Jenny

(closer)
About the deal Whatever fucking deal
you had to kill my daughter for when she
found out about it you bastard

Wilson drops to the ground too in a passionate fury starts
strangling Valentine

WILSON
Tell me Tell me about it you fucking
bastard

Easing up just enough for Valentine to sputter out a
response

VALENTINE
She couldve had the deal I wouldve
handed it to her if she wanted I would
have given her everything

WILSON
Why then Why did you do it

Theyre locked in a kind of embrace Sprayed by the waves
crashing into the rocks Sweating and gasping and exhausted
and hurt and furious

VALENTINE
She didnt want to share it she wanted
to stop it To stop me She said shed
turn me in

WILSON
Shock of recognition on his face At those words

VALENTINE
She said You go ahead with this Ill
turn you in Terry

Wilson sits back Panting Totally spent The two of them
Both on the ground now Whatever energy they had left drained
-- Valentine from his confession Wilson from hearing it
Valentine shaking sobbing Still not realizing the pathetic
folly of his actions

VALENTINE
She was serious She would have done it
She had the phone in her hand She was
going to do it

WILSON

Knows that the girl he loved loved Valentine too Having
heard the truth the last vestige of revenge has vanished

He gets up and walks away Leaving the quivering shell of
Valentine behind

CUT

INT BIG SUR HOUSE LIVING ROOM NIGHT

away from him along the floor Sits against a wall holding
