A civilization is destroyed only when its gods are

Emil Cioran
EXT FOREST - DAWN
Bare as all hell The trees stripped of their bark and white

like ghosts Some torn violently from their roots and

STARK GRAY SUNLIGHT shafts between the trees clouded by a
creeping fog that obscures the true color of everything A
LIGHT SNOW flutters The world monochrome lifeless and

A CAT prowls across the dead earth Barely recognizable as
the domestic breed it might once have been Its fur mangy
rank body rib-thin from starvation Entirely feral

It moves slowly cautiously Sniffing the air scanning the
forest alert Trusting nothing of its surroundings It

across a leaf-strewn clearing closing stealthily on

A DEAD MAN splayed face-down in the earth His feet bare
Face frozen in a grim death mask A GAPING GUNSHOT WOUND in
his head the dried blood caked around it matting his hair
As the cat moves closer approaching warily

POV FROM ACROSS THE CLEARING

About thirty yards away Someone is watching Waiting SLOW
felled

cat

DEEP BREATHS heard through a GASMASK RESPIRATOR
CLOSE ON A PAIR OF INDUSTRIAL GOGGLES

The MIRRORED LENSES reflecting the forest clearing locked
onto the cat The slow metered breathing continues

THE CAT slows but continues pacing toward the corpse More
cautious than ever It inches forward sniffing at the body

ON THE WATCHER Crouched behind the mangled stump of a

tree Concealed beneath a camouflaging mesh of leaves twigs
and bracken A ghillie suit of the kind used by snipers

THE CAT sniffs at the dead mans hand frozen by death in a
grotesquely contorted claw The animal still unsure Looks
around again checking its surroundings for predators

THE WATCHER moves almost imperceptibly The leaves covering
him rustle ever so slightly as we hear - just barely - the
familiar creaking sound of a BOW STRING BEING DRAWN TAUT

THE CAT hears it Looks up alert Staring right at the
watcher but he is too well camouflaged to be seen An
interminable tense BEAT - is the prey going to flee

Finally the cat turns its attention back to the carcass
nibbling gingerly at the flesh of the mans fingers

THE WATCHER looses the arrow It sails across the clearing
and SKEWERS THE CAT clean through It drops to the ground

THE WATCHER STANDS shaking off the ghillie suit revealing
him to us for the first time

He wears a weather-beaten knee-length duster Hooded sweater
with more layers beneath that Torn pants and scuffed work
boots Everything filthy and battered from years of wear

Along with the goggles his face remains obscured by a

DISPOSABLE PAPER DUST MASK and a CRUDELY-FASHIONED FUR HAT
with dangling ear flaps that may once itself have been a

Around his neck he wears a silver SAINT CHRISTOPHER PENDANT
hanging from a frayed twine cord

His name is ELI

burned-

He shoulders the bow and walks across the clearing Crouches
beside the dead cat and pulls out the arrow Wipes the blood
from the shaft then reaches down to collect the body
Suddenly the cat SCREECHES AND FLAILS WILDLY Eli recoils
falling backward stunned as the cat - MORTALLY WOUNDED BUT
FIGHTING TO THE DEATH - bites and claws desperately at him
Eli struggles violently with the cat wrestling it to the
ground and grabbing up a HUNK OF FALLEN BRANCH He holds the
writhing animal down and CLUBS IT until it lays still

He sits back breathing harder than the dustmask will allow
He yanks it down revealing the dirty unshaven face

Impossible to tell his age but certainly not a young man
For a moment he just sits there Then bundles up the dead
and returns to the mangled tree stump Folds away his

suit into a nearby RUCKSACK which he hauls up onto his back
A canteen dangles from the backpack a SHOTGUN strapped to
its side Eli reaches down for his final possession - an old

SAMURAI SWORD in a scabbard which he slings across his back

He gazes up at the sky A snowflake drifts down and lands on
his cheek He reaches up and brushes it away leaving a

SMEAR on his face Not snow after all but some kind of ASH
EXT FOREST ROAD - DAY

Eli emerges from the treeline onto the cracked and ruptured
asphalt Lined by more of those ghostly stripped-bare

He sniffs the air breathing it in Checks the road in both
directions Deserted A few yards away is the rusted

out chassis of a CAR He heads toward it
The car rests half on the road half in the adjacent ditch
Stripped of its tires and engine In the drivers seat is a

MUMMIFIED BODY A BULLET HOLE piercing its forehead

Eli regards the body dispassionately Tries the door handle

old-

but its jammed He yanks on it harder and eventually
wrenches it open He leans in and checks the mans feet

Theyre bare No shoes or socks Eli curses under his

He leaves the car behind and heads on down the road As he
walks away we see that the sole of one of his boots has
loose held in place now only by a rubber band

EXT ROAD - DAY

Eli continues down the road He ambles along slowly a man
no hurry A man who has been walking a long time

The road has since emerged from the forest Passing now
through a wasteland of dead scrub brush and urban junk

The sun beats down from directly overhead The sky has no
color to it paper-white The unfiltered suns stark light
leaves everything seeming bleached-out over-exposed

CRANE UP as Eli walks on On the horizon is the silhouette

a CITY Or what was once a city Columns of BLACK SMOKE rise
from within casting a deathly pall over the skyline BURNED
AND BROKEN SKYSCRAPERS jut out like tombstones

Eli reaches a fork in the road and stops The road hes on
appears to wind off in the direction of the ruined city on
the horizon The other fork continues on into the wasteland
After a brief pause Eli changes direction and heads off

the other fork away from the city

EXT ABANDONED TOWN - DAY

Little more than a main street lined with storefronts Eli
walks steadily along side-stepping rubble and debris
Ignoring the petrified corpses lying in the street

He passes by abandoned stores every one picked clean Empty

shelves smashed windows Looted and burned He doesnt even
look inside knowing already that he will find nothing

Until he comes to a store that does cause him to stop An

fashioned sign squeaks on rusted hinges in the breeze
swings

shoe

shotgun

EDS SHOES - GENTLEMENS AND LADIES FOOTWEAR
He steps into the doorway and pushes open the door It

open on its one remaining hinge before splintering away from
the frame and crashing to the floor in a cloud of dust

INT SHOE STORE - CONTINUOUS
Eli steps inside Like all the others the store has been
cleaned out Shoe racks and empty boxes strewn over the

floor The whole place reeking of dead musty air

Eli looks around just to be sure Drags his sheathed sword
idly along the empty racks as he checks them Nothing

As he turns back for the door his foot nudges against a

box Its not empty He crouches down flips the lid off
hopefully and pulls out a LADYS HIGH-HEELED SHOE

He strokes the shoe leather with his hand Shakes his head
grimly then tosses the shoe back into the box and leaves

EXT ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY

On the outskirts of town In disrepair - peeling paint
broken windows damp-stained walls - but habitable

Eli stands in the front yard surrounded by brownish
overgrown weeds Thinking it over Turns to face the setting
sun It will be dark soon He turns back toward the house

INT ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY

The front door is sent CRASHING OPEN with a hard kick
revealing Eli silhouetted in the fading sunlight The

unhitched from his pack and held ready He moves inside

Another dead place Flies buzzing in the still dank air
Everything covered in a thick layer of dust but otherwise
largely preserved An eerie snapshot of a world long gone

KITCHEN

Every cupboard empty Eli checks each one poking around in
the dark corners with his sword but finds nothing but dust
thick

checking

SO

He opens the freezer checks inside Empty save for a small
ICEBOX The lid stuck fast with mildew and gunk Eli digs at
it with his grimy fingernails and manages to pry it open

Inside are the wizened petrified remains of a HUMAN HAND
Floating in slimy discolored water The smell vile and

enough to make Eli retch He quickly jams the lid back on

BEDROOM

A wooden bedframe stripped clean The dresser drawers have
been emptied and lie strewn across the floor Eli moves
toward a large walk-in closet and opens the door

No clothes inside - just the near-fossilized corpse of a MAN
HANGING BY A NOOSE Twisting gently back and forth

Unfazed Eli crouches down and checks the mans feet An old
pair of Converse All-Stars hang limp from the mans skeletal
ankles Eli calmly sets about unlacing them

He checks the size theyre a fit He upturns each shoe and
shakes the old flakes of mummified flesh from them Discards
his ruined boots and puts on the sneakers laces them up

He walks around pacing up and down getting a feel for the
new shoes They feel good For the first time he smiles

LATER

Eli sits in the corner roasting the carcass of the dead cat
over a small CAMPFIRE He cleans the animals pelts as he
watches it cook Pokes at the meat with a pen-knife

it for done-ness It appears ready to eat
He clasps his hands together in prayer
ELI
Dear Lord thank you for your
generosity in providing us today
with this bountiful feast

He speaks QUIETLY his voice barely above a whisper Even

we catch the accent - a RASPY OLD-WORLD MIDWEST DRAWL like
John Wayne or some other long-forgotten western icon
off

to

ELI
Thank you for the many gifts that
you have given me Thank you for
your protection and your guidance
Thank you for bringing me this far
I know my long journeys end is
near I ask now only for the
strength and the courage to
complete the task that you in your
infinite wisdom saw fit to bestow
upon me over all men I wont let
you down Amen

He signs a cross over himself then uses the knife to saw

a chunk of meat Takes a bite savoring the taste with great
relish To him its grade-A filet mignon

ELI
Hey You hungry
It appears as though he is talking to himself until a RAT

emerges from his coat pocket whiskers twitching keenly Eli
offers it some meat The rat gnaws enthusiastically at it

SUNDOWN

The last of the waning sunlight shafts through the bedrooms
broken window Eli rummages through his backpack pulls out

SMALL PACKAGE wrapped in cloth and tied fast with string
He sits back in his corner and carefully unwraps it Its an
OLD LEATHER-BOUND BOOK The binding cracked and pages dog-

eared thumbed through a thousand times and more

Eli gazes lovingly at it Lets his fingers play across the
beat-up old leather cover A cherished thing

He begins to read half-hidden in the shadows of the fading
sunlight Silently mouthing the words as he reads them

MANY PAGES LATER

Eli closes the book and parcels it back up as before
Replaces it in his pack then reaches in for something else

A CAR BATTERY Old and streaked with acid stains Attached
up

on

road

a tangled bunch of ELECTRICAL WIRING and JUMPER CABLES Eli
reaches into his pocket and produces

AN IPOD Badly beat-up the case pretty much held together
with duct tape But functional Eli attaches the battery
cable to the iPod and places the headphones in his ears
The music plays Mozarts Piano Concerto No 20 in D Minor

Eli rests back against the wall and pushes the volume way

THE MUSIC SWELLS Elis fingers dance and swoop in the air
as though conducting an orchestra as he is transported by
the music to another world a world far from this one

MORNING

Sunlight shafts through the window Eli sits slumped in the
exact same position headphones still in his ears Asleep

The rat scurries up Elis chest and licks his face Slowly
he wakes realizing he fell asleep with his music still on

Checks the battery Its dead drained overnight He frowns

He gets to his feet moves to the window and checks outside
All seems quiet He loads up his backpack and weapons

ELI
Come on now

The rat scurries up his leg onto his duster and disappears
into the breast pocket Eli turns and moves out

EXT ABANDONED HOUSE - MORNING
The gate squeaks shut behind Eli as he exits the front yard
He breathes in the air turns to feel the warm morning sun

his face Then turns away from it and walks on down the

EXT ROAD - DAY

The landscape barren and featureless road lined with dead
trees Eli walks along the warped and broken asphalt

The road is strewn with burned-out cars and debris from a
world long dead A warped metal sign by the side of the road
in

up

reads LITTER REMOVAL NEXT TWO MILES BY CIRCUIT CITY

Up ahead is a HUNCHED FIGURE by the side of the road Eli
arrives to see that its a YOUNG WOMAN Bone-thin dressed

filthy rags Skin plagued by an unpleasant rash

The SHOPPING CART she was pushing has overturned into a
roadside ditch spilling its contents Blankets tins of
food old clothes Shes on her knees trying to gather it

She looks up as she sees Eli approaching Instantly cowers
from him raising her hands to protect herself Terrified

YOUNG WOMAN
Oh Please dont hurt me Here
take anything you want You want
some food Take it

She offers him a can of pet food with a trembling hand Eli
stands there looking at her His expression impossible to
read behind the mirrored goggles

ELI
Im not going to hurt you

YOUNG WOMAN
Thats what the last guys said

Eli bends down and picks up a couple of the carts spilled
contents Steps forward and offers them to her

ELI
Here

She blinks Unsure Cautiously she reaches out and takes it

YOUNG WOMAN
Could you help me The wheel came
off I cant fix it Maybe if I
could get it out of the ditch But
I cant

Eli looks at the cart It has come to rest in the ditch just
inches from a THICK BRACKEN HEDGEROW that lines the road

He looks again at the girl Her faded blouse is unbuttoned
revealing a little cleavage Her skirt torn along the leg
the

They

couple

him

showing more than a little thigh Almost deliberate
He sniffs the air Watches the hedgerow warily Just like
cat he hunted his senses heightened and on alert

Behind the hedge THREE ROADSIDE BANDITS are crouched
waiting to pounce Each armed with a crude blunt weapon

exchange anxious looks
ELI sniffs the air again - then backs away from the girl

ELI
One good thing about no soap any
more You can smell the road agents
a mile off

The girls face falls as Eli backs up The three bandits
EMERGE FROM THE HEDGEROW brandishing their weapons A

of them wear old sunglasses and goggles similar to Elis

The BANDIT LEADER grabs the girl by a fistful of hair as he
passes yanking her painfully to her feet

BANDIT LEADER
Dumb bitch What did we tell you

He pushes her away she crumples to the road in a heap

Eli backs away but TWO MORE ARMED BANDITS drop from hiding
in the trees behind cutting off his escape surrounding

BANDIT LEADER
What you got there in the pack

ELI
Nothing

BANDIT LEADER
Yeah thats what they all say How
about you take it off real slow and
tip it out sos we can take a look

BANDIT 2 notices the shotgun strapped to the pack

BANDIT 2
Hes got a gun

BANDIT LEADER
Shit it aint loaded They never
are Aint that right old man
(BEAT)
Open the fucking pack or die

ELI
I cant do that

The bandit leader steps forward aggressively Now within
striking distance of Eli He grins teeth filthy and rotten

BANDIT LEADER
Want us to do it for you We can
get it off real easy after weve
hacked your fucking arms off

Eli remains perfectly calm And though he speaks with a
soft
even tone there is something formidable about his voice

ELI
Its real important you boys listen
to me and understand The man I
work for you do not want to cross
him See Im under his protection
You stand in my way you stand in
his And he will cut you down with
a righteous fury - through me For
I am his faithful instrument

BEAT The bandit leader looks at Eli incredulously and
then LAUGHS The other bandits laugh along nervously

BANDIT LEADER
What the hell are you some kinda
preacher

ELI
Something like that

BANDIT LEADER
Well I got news for you preacher
man Whatever kinda God you reckon
yourself to be working for he left
these parts a long time ago He
aint here to protect your ass Now
take off the pack and set it on the
ground

Eli doesnt move doesnt say a word The bandit leader

takes
another step forward and shoves him in the shoulder
BANDIT LEADER
You fucking listening to me
ELI
I hear you You lay that hand on me
again and you will not get it back
The other bandits exchange nervous looks This is not how
its supposed to go
BANDIT LEADER
All right I had just about enough
of this shit
He lunges forward grabs the shoulder strap of Elis pack
If you blinked you missed it But somehow Eli has now drawn
his sword A RIVULET OF BLOOD snakes down along the blade
and

drips onto the asphalt

Bandit leaders hand is still gripped firmly around Elis
shoulder strap But its no longer connected to his arm The
SEVERED HAND hangs there from the strap dripping blood

Bandit leader staggers backward and raises the bloody stump
where his hand once was Looks at it in shock and horror

BANDIT LEADER
What you just he just cut my
fucking hand off My fucking hand

Eli pries the hand loose from the strap and tosses it onto
the road as bandit leaders legs give out and he slumps to
the asphalt His eyes dart around as though confused

BANDIT LEADER
What you standin around for Kiss
him

BANDIT 3
Whats he talkin about kiss him

ELI
Hes in shock He means kill him

yards

sobbing

watches

A tense BEAT And then the four remaining bandits ATTACK ELI
ALL AT ONCE weapons flailing

Eli flourishes the sword A BLUR TOO FAST TO FOLLOW But
its clear he is possessed of an inhuman level of skill

It is over in moments The four bandits LAY SLAIN IN THE
ROAD blood pooling out onto the asphalt

The bandit leader crawls toward his severed hand a few
away Eli steps in and kicks it out of his reach
ELI
I told you you wouldnt be getting

that back

Bandit leader looks up to see the figure of Eli bearing down
on him silhouetted ominously against the sun He looks for

moment like an avenging angel something not of this world

BANDIT LEADER
Who are you

ELI
My name is Eli

And with that Eli runs him through with his sword
He turns to see the young woman slumped in the road
She cowers again as he approaches certain that she is next

He WALKS PAST HER Sheathes his sword then pulls out the
shopping cart from the ditch and rights it The woman

incredulously as he gathers up her supplies into the cart
ELI
Take it and go on your way And
dont fall in with men like these
again No good can come

She looks at him puzzled

YOUNG WOMAN
Why are you doing this

Eli says nothing Walks back to the slain bandits crouches
beside them and begins searching their bodies

He takes a scarf from around the neck of one Finds a Zippo
lighter on another checks that it works and pockets it

LATER

The five bodies are lined neatly in the ditch half-covered
with dirt The best burial they are going to get

Eli stands before them head bowed in prayer He speaks
quietly and quickly a speech he has given many times

ELI
God the father of mercies through
the death and resurrection of his
son has reconciled the world to
himself and sent the holy spirit
among us for the forgiveness of
sins

The young woman stands a few yards away watching him
transfixed She has never seen anyone like him

ELI
Through the ministry of the church
may he give you pardon and peace
and I absolve you from your sins in
the name of the father and of the
son and of the holy spirit Amen

He turns and walks away down the road passing the woman

YOUNG WOMAN
Thank you Youre a good man

ELI
There are no good men on the road

YOUNG WOMAN
Where are you going

ELI
West

YOUNG WOMAN
out

he

takes

on

Can can I come with you
He doesnt even turn back to look at her

ELI
No

He walks on into the horizon
EXT FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY

Straddling the desert like a giant crumbling monument to a
long-dead civilization Eli steadily climbs his way up

He comes to an abrupt stop as we realize suddenly that the
overpass has COLLAPSED at mid-point RUSTED IRON RODS jut

from where the roadway has been severed

Eli just stands there at the edge for a moment feeling the
wind whip around him his coat fluttering in the breeze

The overpasss collapsed section is now just a MOUNTAINOUS
PILE OF RUBBLE that leads down to the road below
Eli steps onto the rubble About to make his way down when
FREEZES He hears something The faintest of sounds He
cover peering down at the road beneath the overpass to see
TWO PEOPLE walking together on the road We see everything
from ELIS POV - too far to make out much detail but
apparently it is a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE
The man pushes along an OLD WHEELBARROW covered by a tarp as
the woman seemingly his wife walks alongside The barrows

rusted wheel gives out a plaintive rhythmic SQUEAK

Eli ducks down again as he hears something else This time
much louder The menacing growl of MOTORCYCLE ENGINES

FOUR BIKES IN TOTAL Riding out of the horizon closing in

the couple They see the bikes coming and panic Try
desperately to steer the barrow off the road

The bikes screech to a halt and the FOUR RIDERS dismount
Brandishing a variety of weapons The couple make a run for

road

it but theyre quickly chased down and tackled to the

The woman SCREAMS and struggles helplessly as the bikers
swarm over the man like a pack of predatory animals

The woman is pulled to the ground and the clothes stripped
from her Eli turns away He knows what comes next

Eli listens as the woman screams and screams He reaches for
his shotgun hesitates then withdraws his hand

ELI
It aint your concern Stay on the
path It aint your concern Stay
on the path

Eli repeats it like a mantra He clearly wants to intervene
but will not permit himself to Instead he simply sits and
waits grimly as the woman continues to scream for help And
then finally suddenly is silenced

Down below the bodies of the man and woman lay dead and
bloodied in the dirt The bikers tear the tarp from the
wheelbarrow spilling its contents onto the asphalt

They ferret through the items scavenging a few items - we
dont see what - and stuffing them into an old cloth

They leave the rest strewn in the road and ride off in the
direction they came dust pluming in their wake

Eli waits until the sound of the motorcycles has receded
the far distance before emerging from his hiding place
EXT ROAD BENEATH OVERPASS - DAY

Eli crouches on one knee before the murdered couple He
a cross over their ravaged bodies as he mutters a prayer
under his breath Then stands and continues on down the
EXT ROAD FORK - DAY

More desolate wasteland as far as the eye can see The road
forks again here Eli arrives at the junction and stops

An

of

The road Eli is on leads further into the west The other
fork heads toward a SMALL TOWN just visible on the horizon

A HAND-PAINTED SIGN has been driven into the dirt nearby No
words just a series of CRUDE PICTOGRAMS A BED A PLATE OF
FOOD A WATER FAUCET AN ARROW points toward the town

Eli pauses thinking it over Retrieves the iPod from his
pocket Clicks the button but no response He sighs

He turns and heads down the other fork toward town

EXT DESERT TOWN - OUTSKIRTS - DAY

A primitive sprawling village of tents and barn-like
structures Built from corrugated iron rotted wood molded
plastic tarpaulin - materials scavenged from the old world
HUDDLED RESIDENTS are dressed in little more than rags many

wearing goggles like Elis to shield their eyes from the

Eli stands at the edge of town Reluctant to enter but he
braces himself and walks on in And as he rounds a corner
entering the center of town an astonishing sight

EXT DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

The broad thoroughfare now all that remains of whatever town
once stood here Many of the old storefronts still largely
intact but patched up with salvaged materials The asphalt

street warped and cracked parking meters bent and smashed

Its a lot like the abandoned town Eli passed through
earlier except VERY MUCH ALIVE - BUSTLING WITH TOWNSFOLK

Its at once a familiar and also a disturbing sight - like

old Norman Rockwell painting of classic small-town America
but filtered through the devastating eye of an apocalypse

unsettling juxtaposition of the old world and the new

The centerpiece of the town is a GRAND THEATER at the head

the main street THE PALLADIUM Like the rest of the town
badly damaged and shoddily fixed-up But still standing

Eli walks down the street and approaches a BLACKSMITH
residents

like

hammering out a metal plate over an anvil outside his store

ELI
You got an engineer or a fuelman
around here

The blacksmith doesnt look up from his work but motions
toward a storefront at the far end of the street

ELI
Thanks

Eli heads down the street Stopping when he comes across a
STATUE erected in the center of the road A TALL MAN crudely
fashioned in clay One hand placed paternally on the head of
a SMALL CHILD the other outstretched toward the sun

As he observes the statue Eli notices that passing
take a moment to PAUSE AND GENUFLECT before it Worshipping

Curious Eli reaches up and runs his hand over the statues
face Then hears SHUFFLING FEET behind him and turns as a
PARADE OF EMACIATED MEN AND WOMEN trudges past Roped
together at the waist each man leading the one behind

Heads shaved thin from malnutrition And each one BLIND
They gaze at the ground with pale dead eyes They carry
picks shovels and other tools - a sightless CHAIN GANG

Eli watches as the pathetic parade shuffles past herded

cattle by a brutish CHAIN GANG BOSS who swats at them with a
stick to keep them moving and indicate direction

CHAIN GANG BOSS
Come on move it

The gang boss glares at Eli as he passes by Eli doesnt
return the look just continues crossing the street as the
blind are herded away Headed toward a wooden building with
pictogram of a LIGHTNING BOLT suspended above the door
INT ENGINEER WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
Whatever this place once was its now a kind of POST-

APOCALYPTIC RADIO SHACK Shelves display a variety of goods
Engine parts Old electrical wiring Small appliances

An old ELECTRIC GENERATOR rumbles noisily powering strings
of multi-colored CHRISTMAS LIGHTS that hang all around

Behind the main counter a convoluted Rube Goldberg-esque
STILL is running An ENGINEER in a leather apron pours the
remnants of a can of motor oil into the stills funnel

Attached to the still is an old MOTORCYCLE MIRROR In its
reflection the engineer sees Eli checking out the store

Without turning around he reaches surreptitiously behind
the
counter for something

Eli turns toward the counter - to find the engineer training
a PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUN right at him

ENGINEER
I dont know you

Eli slowly raises his hands

ELI
Im not from around here

ENGINEER
No shit Who are you

ELI
Im just a customer

ENGINEER
A customer with a shotgun

He nods toward the shotgun visible on Elis backpack

ENGINEER
You come in here to rip me off

The engineers hands tremble his finger tight on the
trigger This man needs to be talked down carefully

ELI
No Ill set it down Okay

ENGINEER
Slowly

Eli nods Unhitches the pack and sets it down steps away

ENGINEER

You carry a gun in the outland you
dont bring one into town less you
live there Dont you know that

ELI
Im sorry I forgot Ive been on
the road a long time

This seems to make the engineer more suspicious of Eli

ENGINEER
Show me your hand

ELI
Im not a-

The engineer jerks the shotgun at Eli nervously

ENGINEER
I said show me your fucking hand

Eli raises his hand and holds it outstretched palm faced
downward The engineer watches it closely for any sign of

ticks or tremors but Elis hand stays steady as a rock

ELI
Im not one of them

The sight of the steady hand seems to reassure the engineer
little Finally he lowers the shotgun

ENGINEER
What do you want

ELI
Im just passing through I need
some help I can pay

ENGINEER
What kinda help And what kinda
pay

ELI

Im going to get something out of
my pack Okay

The engineer raises the shotgun nervously again
ELI
I know I know Slowly

The engineer watches him like a hawk as Eli opens up his

pack
and pulls out the car battery When he sees it he gasps
ENGINEER
Holy shit
Eli places it on the counter The engineer looks it over
with

awe like its a priceless historical artifact

ENGINEER
Whered you find this

ELI
Years ago in the outland back east
aways

ENGINEER

Does it work

ELI
Yeah it just needs a charge Can
you do it I got the cables

ENGINEER
Depends if you also got the coin

Eli pulls the Zippo lighter from his pocket The engineer
picks it up sparks the flint watches the flame flicker

ENGINEER
Itll take a couple hours Theres
a bar across the street you can
wait they just opened up

ELI
Ill wait here

ENGINEER
You dont trust me

I dont know you

INT PALLADIUM - AUDITORIUM - DAY

This once grand theater have been largely gutted - seats
out fixtures and fittings stripped curtains ripped from
stage But still theres a sense of grandeur to this place
Looking out over the stage a ROYAL BOX - once the most
prestigious seat in the house - has been converted into an

OFFICE of sorts Seats removed and replaced by an ORNATE
MAHOGANY DESK facing inward a CHANDELIER suspended above

The whole set-up is gaudy and ostentatious - the work of
someone who wants to project an aura of power and wealth
has no taste whatsoever

A TALL MAN is seated in a battered leather armchair behind
the desk deeply involved in an OLD PAPERBACK BOOK

The books cover is faded and partially torn away the title
still just visible 7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE

The man is OLDER than most weve seen His skin weathered by
the elements and by a long lifes experience One of the

few people weve seen in this world close to Elis age - and
unlike everyone else weve seen he appears healthy and

groomed A rich mane of hair full set of teeth
He wears a tattered SUIT AND TIE None of it matches
everything scavenged from different outfits and eras But he

looks almost civilized Respectable His name is CARNEGIE

He looks up from his book at the sound of a POLITE COUGH

REDRIDGE stands before him Tall powerfully built

CARNEGIE
What is it

His accent is like caramel A RICH DEEP-SOUTH DRAWL

REDRIDGE
Survey team just finished up their
inspection It aint good

Carnegie lowers his book Concerned

CARNEGIE
How bad is it

REDRIDGE
Pressure is down again and going
by the new rod they sank levelsre
lower than theyve ever been

Carnegie stands Thinking This is bad news

CARNEGIE
How long

REDRIDGE
Hard to say Six months maybe A
little longer if were careful But
were already-

CARNEGIE
Halve the rations

REDRIDGE
We just halved “em last-

CARNEGIE
So halve them again

BEAT Carnegie stares Redridge down Nobody but nobody
questions his orders

REDRIDGE
Youre going to have to say
something Folks were none too
happy last time Gonna be worse
now you can count on it

Carnegie sighs rubs his brow He knows Redridge is right
EXT DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY
A LARGE CROWD OF TOWNSFOLK - several hundred strong - has

assembled outside the Palladium theater AN ARMED CREW OF
CARNEGIES GOONS keeps watch over the crowd
word

Carnegie stands on a BALCONY above the theater marquee He
treats the balcony like a pulpit speaking through a
MICROPHONE connected to an old PA SYSTEM that carries his
words to the far reaches of the crowd

CARNEGIE
I want you all to remember how far
weve come together And how far we
still can go if only we believe
When I brought us here to this
oasis - this promised land - we
knew there would be hardships Knew
there would be sacrifices But we
also knew that we were creating for
ourselves a world where we could be
safe from the horrors of the
forsaken lands beyond our borders

The crowd listens intently hanging on Carnegies every

He is an incredibly charismatic and persuasive speaker - his
cultivated image and inspiring confident delivery remind us
of a TELEVISION EVANGELIST

CARNEGIE
And I want you all to remember
above all that it is not the water
with which we have been blessed
that is the true lifeblood of this
town but faith

This sends a MURMUR OF DISCONTENT through the crowd Many
dont like where they suspect this may be going Carnegie
senses this and dials up his rhetoric - delivering it now
with the fire-brand passion of an old-time baptist preacher

CARNEGIE
It is our faith that sustains us
brothers and sisters Hallelujah

The crowd is divided Many return the Hallelujah with
varying levels of conviction Others are not convinced But
Carnegie continues unabated selling it harder than ever

CARNEGIE
And mark me the ultimate
validation of that faith is coming
The sacred Word of Our Lord that
formed the world before and will
reform it once again is coming to
this town to bring it succor bring
it nourishment bring it new life
For the Almighty Himself has spoken
unto me and promised it

Carnegie is such an impassioned and inspiring speaker its
almost impossible not to get caught up and swept away by his
words His apparently unshakable belief is infectious

CARNEGIE

In the meantime He has asked us
all to be patient To walk the hard
road of the faithful just a little
longer And to do that we must
give just a little more

(BEAT)
Water rations will be halved until
further notice

This sends a much broader ripple of discontent through the
crowd - this news has not been received well at all Some
still keep the faith but many more are perturbed by this

Carnegie motions for the crowd to settle down

CARNEGIE
I understand your frustration The
road to salvation is a difficult
one - but what lies at the end of
that road is a greater glory
beyond anything you can imagine

A DISCONTENTED VILLAGER steps forward pushing through the
crowd and jabbing his finger angrily up at Carnegie

DISCONTENTED VILLAGER
Weve heard this all before When
are you going to-

Carnegies goons quickly move in and efficiently SILENCE THE
MAN removing him from the crowd Dissent is not tolerated
here Carnegie goes on speaking as if nothing had happened

CARNEGIE
I know each and every one of you
will understand the necessity of
this action It was faith that
built this town - and faith that
his

will sustain it even through the
dark times that may lie ahead But
it is always darkest before dawn -
and the new dawn is coming

(BEAT)
May God go with you all

Carnegie steps back inside leaving the crowd to talk among
themselves clearly mixed about what they have heard

As the assembled townsfolk disperse FOUR MOTORCYCLES roar
into town and pull up outside the Palladium

As the riders dismount one detaches a CLOTH SATCHEL from

bikes cargo rack The four riders head inside They each
have long straggly hair and brutish expressions

We recognize them now as the BIKER BANDITS who killed the
couple on the road under the freeway overpass

INT PALLADIUM - SECOND FLOOR - DAY

Carnegie emerges into the second-floor hallway from the
balcony mopping his brow Exhausted and stressed from his
grand theatrical display and from its mixed reception

Redridge climbs the stairs to meet him

REDRIDGE
One of the road crews just rolled
into town

Carnegie looks at his cracked old wristwatch

CARNEGIE
Of course they did the bars open
Outlanders always looking for
answers at the bottom of a bottle

REDRIDGE
Not these guys
(BEAT)
These guys say they got something

That gets Carnegies attention

CARNEGIE
Get them up here now

etc

of

stairs

INT PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - DAY

What was once a grand gilded entrance foyer has like the
rest of the theater been largely gutted But its still
impressive - a spacious bar area with a grand staircase
leading up to a second floor entrance to balcony seats

FADED OLD THEATER POSTERS still hang from the walls

The place has been shabbily converted into a kind of SALOON
Old ripped-out theater seats arranged around tables A
FIREPLACE sputters dimly

A MANGY TABBY CAT walks across the straw-laden floor A
or so CUSTOMERS in the place a mixed rough-looking bunch
Redridge emerges from an upstairs room and nods to a group

his MEN who are holding the bikers at the foot of the

INT PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIES BOX

Carnegie checks his reflection in a CRACKED HAND MIRROR
licks his palm and slicks his hair back He adjusts his tie
as Redridges men usher the bikers into his office

Carnegie wheels around and flashes a smile at them Just as
when he gave his balcony address Carnegie is in performance
mode - charismatic and slick like a campaigning politician

CARNEGIE
Gentlemen Its truly a delight to
see you again I understand your
latest excursion into the outland
has been a profitable one

The bikers exchange looks They understood maybe half the
words in that sentence The lead biker - named HOG - speaks

HOG
We did good

CARNEGIE
Well lets see shall we

Hog tips the satchels contents out onto Carnegies desk

BOOKS About a dozen different volumes of all shapes and
sizes Carnegie rifles excitedly through the collection
We see various titles as he sorts through them Treasure
Island The Da Vinci Code A volume of encyclopedia The
Diary of Anne Frank Tuesdays with Morrie

In amongst the books are a few MAGAZINES An old issue of
OPRAH magazine A torn copy of SPORTS ILLUSTRATED

And a NEWSWEEK The cover graphic illustrates OPPOSING
NUCLEAR ARSENALS over a world globe On one side the STARS
AND STRIPES on the other flags indicating a SINO-ISLAMIC
ALLIANCE The headline reads IS THERE NO TURNING BACK

CARNEGIE
No No No No No

As Carnegie rejects each book with growing disappointment
and
frustration its clear hes looking for a specific volume

CARNEGIE
Its not here

HOG
These aint worth nothin

CARNEGIE
When you bring me the book I asked
you for itll be worth something

The bikers exchange more looks An unspoken conversation

HOG
We been doin this a long time now
Had to make a whole lotta corpses
to bring you all these books You
want us to keep at it reckon its
worth more than a few free glasses
of that swill you call liquor

Carnegies guards bristle ready for a confrontation
Carnegie just smiles always ready to smooth things over

CARNEGIE
Gentlemen gentlemen I urge you
once again to take the long view
here When we find this book - and
believe me we will find it - we
are going to build a new world A
world far greater far more
righteous than this one And you
and I are going to be perched right
on top of it looking down upon it
masters of all creation

As always his carefully stage-managed rhetoric is delivered
with the utmost conviction every word dripping with passion
and persuasion Hes a master salesman a true huckster

CARNEGIE
And you know I think youre
absolutely right

(MORE)

CARNEGIE (contd)
That is worth more than a few
glasses of liquor A whole lot
more

He steps forward and looks Hog right in the eye His gaze
like a laser beam utterly disarming

CARNEGIE
The book I want is out there
somewhere just waiting to be
found Once there were millions of
copies - you only need to find one
Find it and bring it here And I
promise you you will be rewarded
beyond anything you can imagine

Its impossible not to be swayed by this guy Hes just so
full of fiery passion and infectious belief you almost want
to reach into your pocket and hand over your wallet

Hog snatches up his empty satchel

HOG
This better not be bullshit

He turns and marches to the door the other bikers
following
The guards escort them out only Redridge remains

Carnegie slumps back into his chair frustrated pissed off
REDRIDGE

Might help if they knew just what
they were looking for
CARNEGIE
Not one of them can read How would
they even know when they found it

REDRIDGE
So hows about you just tell me

Carnegie and Redridge lock eyes BEAT

REDRIDGE
Two years now you been sending
these crews into the outland
Burning up gas we can barely spare
For a goddamn book What the hell
kinda book can be worth all this

Carnegie ignores him Stands walks toward the door
Redridge
sighs gestures toward the books piled on Carnegies desk

REDRIDGE
What about these

CARNEGIE
Put them with the others

INT PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - DAY

Redridge stands by the marble fireplace tossing the books
into the fire The flames flicker and leap around the books
as their pages blacken and are consumed by the fire

INT ENGINEER WORKSHOP - DAY

Eli watches as the engineer charges the battery with the gas
generator which chugs noisily

He licks his lips dry as sand Unscrews his canteen to take
a drink but its down to its last few drips

ELI
Whats this place across the
street They got any water

ENGINEER
We got our own underground spring
here Only fresh water in a hundred
miles - ifs you can pay for it
shotgun

warped

mirror

Eli thinks a while longer Then stands and stuffs his
inside his pack shoulders his gear and makes for the door

ELI
Ill be back

Eli stops in the doorway and turns back to the engineer

ELI

If that battery aint here when I
get back I will use this gun on
your kneecaps and I will put this
building to the torch and I will
watch it burn to the ground with
you alive inside it So help me
God

And with that he turns and leaves The engineer gulps Not a
hint in Elis voice that he didnt mean every word

INT PALLADIUM - CARNEGIES BEDROOM - DAY
This old second-floor DRESSING ROOM has been converted into
bedroom simply furnished

A WOMAN stands in front of an old DRESSING ROOM MIRROR the
bulbs around the frame burned-out and broken She washes her

face in murky water in an old PORCELAIN BOWL on the dresser

Her name is CLAUDIA Early 30s pretty She gazes into the
mirror as she dries her hands but its so cracked and

its near impossible to see a reflection

The door opens and Carnegie enters He still looks steamed

Claudia doesnt turn to look at him keeps facing the
CLAUDIA

Is that you honey

Carnegie says nothing Just paces angrily up and down
Finally Claudia turns to face him

CLAUDIA
Something wrong
CARNEGIE
More books came in from the road
today

CLAUDIA
Oh Its been a while

CARNEGIE
And itll be a while longer Just
another pile of useless junk If we
dont find the right one soon - if
I cant give these people what they
want to hear

Carnegie trails off the thought too awful to contemplate
Claudia adopts a sympathetic expression supportive

CLAUDIA
Youll find what youre looking
for Its out there somewhere You
just have to have faith

This seems to anger Carnegie He wheels on her

CARNEGIE
Faith Is that what you think were
missing around here

She detects the aggressive tone in his voice and goes quiet
head bowed Carnegie moves toward her angrily

CARNEGIE
My old man used to have faith He

had it in spades My mother too
(MORE)

CARNEGIE (contd)
You know where it got them You
know where it got me

Hes in her face now Claudia avoids eye contact
submissive

CARNEGIE
Faith is for the weak Its for
them out there the sheep This
world is what you can see and touch
and taste Its what you make it
steady

All these years with me you still
dont have any grasp of that
Whats wrong with you woman

Hes shouting now and shes trembling afraid to speak

CLAUDIA
Im sorry

Carnegie realizes hes frightened her He softens

CARNEGIE
No Im sorry I didnt mean to
scare you Hey You okay

He lifts her chin up wipes away a tear

CARNEGIE
You just get me all riled up with
that kind of talk Its not what I
need from you right now
(SMILES)
You know what I need right now

He puts his hands on her lustfully Its clear shes not in
the mood but she halfheartedly responds anyway More out of

a sense of wifely duty than reciprocated passion

As they kiss Carnegie pushes her excitedly against the wall
and feverishly begins unbuckling his pants

INT PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - DAY
The original customers have now been joined by the four
bikers who sit at their own table drinking a clear and

pungent moonshine-type liquor from a shared jar

Eli enters All eyes are on him immediately regarding him
with guarded interest as he pulls up a stool at the bar

The BARTENDER approaches looks him up and down Suspicious

BARTENDER
Outlander Let me see-

Eli raises his hand as before Holds it outstretched

BARTENDER
Whatll it be
Eli places the canteen on the bar

ELI
Water

BARTENDER
Thats the good stuff Gotta eat
into my own ration to sell it - so
I dont sell it cheap

Eli takes off his scarf and puts it on the bar The
bartender
takes it and looks it over Not particularly impressed

BARTENDER
Thatll get you maybe half-way

The bartender spies Elis silver Saint Christopher pendant

BARTENDER
What about that

Eli stuffs the pendant inside his shirt No way thats for
sale Instead he reaches into his coat and produces the fur
pelts he skinned from the dead cat lays them out on the

bar
ELI
Thats the best I got
The bartender takes a pelt and examines it The mangy cat
leaps up onto the bar and approaches Sniffs at the pelts
with suspicion and HISSES at Eli
Eli shoos the cat off the bar with a wave of his hand At
the
bikers table Hog watches this not happy about this
Satisfied with the pelts the bartender gathers them up
along
with the scarf then turns away toward the back room
BARTENDER
Solara
A TEENAGE GIRL emerges from the back No older than 16 or

Dressed in unflattering work clothes face grimy blonde
hair

tied back in a ponytail But even through all this its
up

clear she is a strikingly beautiful young woman

The bartender takes Elis canteen and hands it to Solara
along with a RATION CARD he keeps around his neck

BARTENDER
Take this out back and get it
filled

Solara takes the canteen pausing for a moment to look Eli

and down Unsure quite what to make of him but intrigued
Theres something about him she cant put her finger on

He doesnt look back at her She turns and exits
EXT DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

Solara exits via the Palladiums STAGE DOOR and walks across
the busy street to where TWO OF CARNEGIES ARMED MEN stand
guard around an ENCLOSURE OF CHAIN-LINK FENCE TOPPED WITH
RAZOR WIRE TOWNSFOLK wait in line with bowls and buckets

One of the guards recognizes Solara and lets her cut to the
front of the line He punches two holes in her ration card
and lets her inside the chain-link enclosure

Inside is an OLD RUSTED SPIGOT attached to a pipe emerging
from the earth Solara cranks hard on the handle - it takes

few pulls before the water comes and then only at a weak
trickle it will take a while to fill the canteen

INT PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

As Eli sits at the bar a SHADOW comes into view and looms
large over him Hog is standing behind him glaring cutting
a menacing figure in his armored cycle leathers

Solara senses trouble brewing and moves off taking Elis
canteen away into the back room

HOG
That was my cat

Eli doesnt turn Just looks straight ahead Impossible to
read him behind those mirrored goggles Utterly inscrutable

ELI
Fine specimen

HOG
I saw you push him off the bar

ELI
I didnt push him

HOG
You raised your hand at him

ELI
Sorry It wont happen again

The bartender looks at Hog nervously

BARTENDER
Hey how about another drink Hog

HOG
That cats been comin in here for
nigh on two years It got more
right to be here than you Who the
fuck do you think you are

ELI
I dont want any trouble

Hog grabs him by the arm

HOG
Well thats too bad ‘cause-

Blink Suddenly Hogs head is pinned to the bar by nothing
more than Elis thumb Pressed deep into a nerve cluster in
his neck Eli leans in close as Hog whimpers paralyzed

ELI
I know you Murderer of innocent
travelers on the road Youre going
to spend eternity drowning ina
lake of fire for the things that
youve done Did you know that

The other bikers stand and approach the OTHER CUSTOMERS
following suit Eli senses the trouble gathering behind him

ELI
You go on back to your table and
Ill be on my way All right

Its all Hog can do to just barely nod his head Eli

releases

his thumb Hog staggers backward gasping for breath

Eli stands and makes toward the door but the bikers and

other patrons have moved to block his exit

BURLY PATRON
You push Hog you push all of us

Eli sighs looks down at the floor Hes been pushed one
time

too many today For the first time we see anger in his
face

ELI
Cursed be the ground because of
you By toil shall you eat of it
Thorns and thistles shall it sprout
for you From the ground were you
taken For dust you are

The patrons look at Eli strangely Who is this guy

Eli reaches back and draws the samurai sword Carves a line
in the dirt at his feet with the tip of the blade

ELI
And to dust you shall return

INT PALLADIUM - CARNEGIES BEDROOM - DAY

Carnegie has Claudia pinned against the wall his pants
bunched around his ankles ass bared as he pounds away at
her Not making love This is mechanical loveless sex
Claudia stares vacantly over his shoulder into space as
Carnegie thrusts into her again and again Deeply
uninterested just waiting for it to be over

Suddenly we hear a CRASH OS Carnegie stops and listens

CARNEGIE
Did you hear that What was that

Claudia sees an opening to get out of this
mayhem

CLAUDIA
Maybe you should go check

BEAT Carnegie keeps listening Then comes another CRASH

CARNEGIE
What in the hell is going on

He pulls up his pants grabbing a RIFLE propped by the door
as he rushes out Claudia just stands there for a moment
then reaches down and pulls up her panties

She moves from the wall and makes her way across the room
feeling her way with her hands gazing off into nothingness
Only now do we finally realize that she is BLIND

INT PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Carnegie emerges from the bedroom onto the balcony Looks
down over the railing - and is stunned by what he sees

CHAOS in the bar below Eli cutting a one-man swath of

through the dozen brawlers Most already lie dead TWO MORE
MEN ATTACK Eli and are effortlessly felled by his sword

Carnegie rushes hurriedly along the landing banging loudly
on the doors of the upstairs rooms

CARNEGIE
Get your asses out here

ON ELI Surrounded by the dead only one man left standing
Hog He backs away as Eli circles him like a predator Sword
held ready the blade glistening with dark red blood

SOLARA re-emerges from the back room with Elis refilled
canteen She stops and emits a horrified GASP when she sees

the bloody carnage laid out in the bar before her

She watches mortified as Eli moves toward the helpless
terrified Hog going in for the kill Raising his sword

Suddenly Solara steps forward and CRIES OUT

SOLARA
Stop
Eli FREEZES Sword hanging in the air poised to strike
turns his head to where Solara stands behind the bar

SOLARA
Please dont

BEAT as Eli considers He looks back at Hog still
completely
at his mercy and then LOWERS THE SWORD

ELI
Go

HOG
(CONFUSED )
-What

ELI
It aint for me to judge you Your
time for thats gonna come Believe
me Now go on Get out of here

He

Hog stumbles backward through the door into the sunlight

Eli moves toward Solara who stands petrified behind the

bar

Reaches out and gently pries the canteen from her loose
grip

ELI
Thank you

In the exitway Hog turns back inside grabbing up a BROKEN

BOTTLE from the bloody floor as he goes

Hog rushes Eli from behind Solara sees him coming and goes

to SCREAM - but before any sound can come Eli flips his

sword backward and Hog runs right onto it SKEWERING
HIMSELF

BEAT Hog just stands there for a moment eyes wide frozen

in shock His fingers go limp dropping the bottle

He slides off the sword and collapses to the floor dead

Eli wipes the sword clean and sheathes it Looks around at

the bloodied fallen bodies Then back at Solara

ELI
Im sorry for all the mess
As he turns and heads toward the door

CARNEGIE (0S)
Hold it right there

Accompanied by the sound of MULTIPLE GUNS COCKING

Carnegie is on the landing training his rifle down at Eli
Alongside him FIVE GUNMEN do the same Theyve got him

cold

INT PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIES BOX

Carnegie sits at his desk the huge auditorium and stage
area

visible behind him Eli stands before him Around him are
the

other gunmen who keep their weapons trained on him
Standing at Carnegies side are REDRIDGE and CLAUDIA

CARNEGIE
So who are you

ELI
Nobody A walker in the outland

CARNEGIE
Ive met walkers before Not a
particularly civilized bunch Some
have even taken to eating their own
kind did you know that You
wouldnt be one of those savages
now would you

Carnegies gunmen look him over inspecting him warily

CARNEGIE GUNMAN
He aint got the shakes

Carnegies confident gaze remains fixed on Eli throughout

CARNEGIE
Good This is a civilized town
Under God Do you know what that
means
Eli cant help but react at the mention of that word

CARNEGIE
It means we have laws here Laws
set down long before any of us ever
walked this earth And one of them
is you dont eat the flesh of your
brother Else youre no better than
an animal And not welcome here

Eli doesnt respond Just stands there in Carnegies gaze

CARNEGIE
So whats your business here
friend Walkers dont usually come
into town less they want something

ELI
I had a battery needed charging and
a canteen needed filling I didnt
come here looking for trouble

Barely noticeable Carnegie gestures to one of the gunmen
who nods in acknowledgement and leaves

CARNEGIE
Well you sure as hell found it Do
you know who I am

ELI
No

CARNEGIE
My names Carnegie I own this bar
I own the whole town Youve never
heard of me

ELI
Thats you out there on the street

CARNEGIE
Remarkable likeness isnt it
Youd never guess half the men who
built it were blind A small
tribute from a grateful people I
was deeply touched

ELI
You had slaves build you a monument
natural

to yourself

The mention of that word rankles Carnegie He walks around
the desk toward Eli waves an admonishing finger at him

CARNEGIE
Dont call them slaves Thats an
old word Im not a slaver Im
trying to help these people

Carnegie cant help himself - once again he is in his
element spinning the argument his way pitching Selling

CARNEGIE

In the outland the sightless are
preyed upon like sick animals Here
at least theyre protected They do
the essential work others dont
want And in return they eat they
drink they survive Last year a
couple of them even got married -
performed the ceremony myself

(BEAT)
You see Im not exploiting these
people - Im saving them Any one
of them is free to leave whenever
they wish But here they stay And
they thank me every single day for
their salvation

An impressive impassioned performance He sounds just like
an old-school TV evangelist But Eli is unmoved

ELI
Its none of my business what you
do here Like you said its your
town I just want to be on my way

CARNEGIE
Whats your name walker

Eli doesnt respond Just stands there

CARNEGIE
All right I guess we just call you
Walker Dont see too many folks
your age these days You lived in
the world before You can read

ELI
I read every day
CARNEGIE
Thats good Good man We educated
folk we need to stick together if
were ever going to rebuild this
world People like you and me
were the future

ELI
What do you want with me

CARNEGIE

Straight to the point I like that
Fact is you could be in a lot of
trouble This is a peaceful town
You walk in here armed and the
next thing a dozen of my good
citizens are dead Ive hanged men
for less I could hang you

(BEAT)
Or you could come work for me

ELI
What

CARNEGIE
I never once saw anyone handle
themselves the way you did down
there in that bar I dont know
where you learned it but I sure as
hell could use it

ELI
Im not interested

CARNEGIE
People who work for me can live
better than any walker ever
dreamed Real beds clean water
hot food Women even You could do
a lot worse my friend

ELI
Im not your friend And Im not
staying I got someplace I need to
be Out west

CARNEGIE
West There is nothing west Its

door

all gone a long time ago

ELI
Ive been told different

CARNEGIE
By who

Eli doesnt reply Carnegie smiles dials up the charm

CARNEGIE
All right look Im going to make
you an offer of goodwill Stay the
night think it over Try a little
local hospitality Well talk again
in the morning If youre still not
interested youre free to go No
hard feelings

ELI
Thank you for your offer But Id
prefer to just leave right now So
you can either let me out of here
or I can kill my way out

The gunmen bristle exchange nervous looks Carnegie appears

unfazed He smiles BEAT He looks to the gunman at the
CARNEGIE
Let him go
The gunman opens the door Eli turns and exits

INT ENGINEER WORKSHOP - DAY

heart sinks when he sees Eli enter

little longer than I thought

Eli leans

Eli looks

ELI
How much longer

Its gotta charge overnight You
uh you can always stay here in

in a little closer He smells a rat

at the engineer Hard to be certain

pretty sure hes lying Somebody got to him

INT PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIES BOX

but hes

A VIOLENT COMMOTION is heard from down the hall Suddenly

of Carnegies henchmen comes flying into view as he is

HARD INTO

Eli storms into the box

as he stands to greet Eli

A WALL and slumps to the floor unconscious

CARNEGIE
I knew youd reconsider

ELI
Yeah Howd you know that

CARNEGIE
None of the walkers Ive seen come
here from the outland were ever
what youd call smart I mean all
those years out there alone on the
road some with their brains half-
fried from eating each other - its

pissed MORE GUARDS rush in behind
him Carnegie seated behind his desk waves the guards off
smiling ingratiatingly as ever
understandable why you people
arent the brightest bulbs in the
box But I never met one so dumb
that hed turn down a meal and a
bed if it was offered

ELI
So you didnt send someone across
the street to the engineer

CARNEGIE
Engineer I dont know what youre
talking about If theres something
wrong maybe I can help

Carnegie is a practiced liar Much more difficult to read

CARNEGIE
This is Redridge Hes kind of my
right-hand man around here

Redridge - one of the two men who chased Eli into the room -
steps forward He regards Eli with a distrustful eye

CARNEGIE
Hell show you to your room

INT PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - DUSK
Redridge opens the door and ushers Eli inside

Its another of the dressing rooms converted into a bedroom
less well-appointed than Carnegies own A threadbare rug
Bed with relatively clean sheets A sink for washing

REDRIDGE
Enjoy your stay Therell be
someone outside your room all
night If you need anything

Redridge smirks and closes the door leaving Eli alone Eli
paces across the room Finally sits down on the creaky old

bed Trying to figure out how he managed to get stuck here

He unshoulders his pack sets it down Lies down on the bed
Its been a while since he felt a real bed on his back

A KNOCK at the door Eli gets quickly to his feet
ELI
Hello

The door opens and CLAUDIA enters Carrying a metal tub of
water in both hands and atop that a dinner tray

CLAUDIA
I have this for you Water for
washing and some food

Eli just stands there Totally unfamiliar with this kind of
situation its been too long She smiles embarrassed

CLAUDIA
Well are you going to take it

ELI
Oh Thank you

He takes the stuff from her sets it on the table

CLAUDIA
Youre very welcome

We get the impression that Claudia is as unfamiliar with

this
kind of polite interaction as Eli But she likes it
CLAUDIA
Itll be dark soon
She strikes a match and lights the oil lamp on the table
The

room is lit by its flickering glow

CLAUDIA
Can I get you anything else

ELI
No thank you

CLAUDIA
Well Have a good night

As she turns for the door

ELI
Youre Carnegies woman
CLAUDIA
Why do you ask

ELI
Just making conversation is all
Havent had one of those ina
while Not a real one leastways

Claudia smiles Neither has she

CLAUDIA
He found me in the outland I was
sixteen my family had been
well they were gone There was
just me and my baby

ELI
You had a baby

CLAUDIA
Id met some men on the road Bad
men They

BEAT She trails off struggling with this unhappy memory
Eli gets it raises a hand reassuringly

ELI
Its all right

CLAUDIA
I was on the road for a year after
that I couldnt feed myself let
alone my little girl And then Bill
found us and he promised hed take
care of us He told me he was going
to make a place where we could be
safe And he did He did all that
He built this whole town He kept
us safe And he raised that child
like she was his own Hes been so
good to both of us He saved us
really

Theres a bittersweet quality to Claudias words As though
there is more to the story than she is telling

Eli pulls out a chair at the table offers it to her

ELI
You want to eat some
She smiles and sits Eli sits across from her

ELI
When did you go blind In the war
You get caught in a flash

CLAUDIA
No I was born this way I think
Im lucky like that

ELI
Lucky

CLAUDIA
Its not like I ever knew what Im
missing I was already used to
being like this by the time by
the time it all happened So I got
around pretty good even when I was
on my own And now its easy I
know every creaky old floorboard in
here and its not like I ever go
any place else Bill would never
allow it He worries about me so
much

Again bittersweet The sense that Claudia feels trapped
Thinking about it begins to upset her She gets up

CLAUDIA
I should go Hell be wondering
where I am

Eli stands escorts her to the door and opens it
CLAUDIA
Thank you I enjoyed our

conversation

ELI
So did I

Eli closes the door then sits back at the table
INT PALLADIUM - CARNEGIES BEDROOM - NIGHT

Carnegie washes looking at himself in the old dressing-room
mirror He sees Claudia enter the room in its dim
reflection

CARNEGIE
You took your time in there How
long does it take to deliver a
plate of food and some water

A subtly accusing tone It makes Claudia nervous

CLAUDIA
He wanted to talk

CARNEGIE
Oh What about

CLAUDIA
Nothing really He asked me what it
was like to be blind

CARNEGIE
He tell you anything about him

CLAUDIA
No I dont think he likes to talk
about himself much

CARNEGIE
Yeah I got that

Claudia moves to the bedside begins to undress

CLAUDIA
I dont think hes going to change
his mind by morning I dont think
hes going to stay

CARNEGIE
What makes you say that

CLAUDIA
Just strikes me as the kind of man
whos of a mind is all Doesnt
seem like the type to go changing
it once its set

CARNEGIE
Well well just see about that

CLAUDIA
You saw him Hes not like the
others You wont be able to smooth-
talk him and wrap him around your
finger like you usually do

CARNEGIE
Who said anything about me
(BEAT)
Im sending Solara

Claudia reacts suddenly to this Shocked and angry

CLAUDIA
Youre doing what

CARNEGIE
You know how often these walkers
get laid Never Least not by
anything living or willing Girl
like her can be very persuasive

CLAUDIA
You cant send her in there with
him Hes dangerous hes a killer

CARNEGIE
You went in there readily enough

CLAUDIA
Thats different Solaras just a
child she cant-

Carnegie sighs tiring of this

CARNEGIE
Shes a grown woman now Claudia
Sooner or later youre going to
have to accept that She has to
earn her keep around here same as
the rest of us

CLAUDIA
By working as a whore Thats all
you think shes fit for

CARNEGIE
Weve each been given a talent to
help us make our way in this world
Some peoples gift is more evident
than others Solaras sure as hell
is

Claudia looks at Carnegie in disgust

CLAUDIA
What kind of a man are you

Now its Carnegies turn to get angry He rounds on her
menacingly She backs off as he approaches

CARNEGIE
Im the kind of man whod pull a
helpless blind girl off the road a
girl whod been beaten and raped
and give her a place where she can
live without fear Without me youd
be just another no-eye lying dead
in the outland picked clean by the
buzzards or shoveling dirt down
there with the others Thats the
kind of man I am

He has her against the wall his face just inches from hers

CLAUDIA
I dont live without fear I
havent for a long time now

Carnegie calms himself backs off Claudia goes to leave

CARNEGIE
Where are you going

CLAUDIA
Im not going to let you do this

Carnegie surges forward and pins Claudia to the wall

CARNEGIE

Youre not going to let me

(BEAT)
Nobody tells me what I can and
cant do in my own town Nobody I
built this world and I am God
here So dont go thinking about
screwing with my plans You know
how this works Solara goes against
me you get hurt You go against
me she gets hurt
the

He releases his grip on her

CARNEGIE
So lets not see anybody get hurt
Okay

He speaks more softly now As he strokes his hand tenderly
through Claudias hair a tear runs down her cheek

INT PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT
Dark outside but the room is brightly lit by the glow of

oil lamp Eli sits up on his bed quietly reading the old
leather-bound book from his backpack

Another KNOCK at the door Eli jumps up and hurriedly hides
the book inside his shirt

ELI
Come in

The door opens to reveal Solara Looking very different than
she did before Cleaned up and wearing a flowery summer
dress blonde hair let down over her shoulders Stunning

Unlike everyone else we have met she seems - physically at
least - totally unscarred by the horrors of the times Far
too beautiful a thing to belong in a world like this

SOLARA
Hi Can I come in

ELI
Someone was already here with food
and water I got everything I need

SOLARA
You sure about that

She glides into the room closing the door Shes good Very
seductive Eli is totally disarmed in her presence

SOLARA
Its too bright in here Mind if I
turn it down a little

She doesnt wait for an answer Moves to the table and turns
down the oil lamp A darker more seductive lighting scheme
SOLARA
Thats better Im Solara Youre
Walker right

ELI
No My names Eli

SOLARA
That short for something Elias

ELI
Elijah
SOLARA
Elijah never heard that one

before Its kinda cute

She sits on the bed kicks her legs playfully Her light
cotton dress revealing in all the right places The
silhouette of her body bathed in the seductive glow of the
oil lamp No red-blooded man on earth could resist her

ELI
Look I dont mean to be rude But
Im really not interested

SOLARA
You sure about that It gets mighty
lonely out there on the road

She leans over on the bed resting on her elbow Her hair
cascades down God damn she looks good

SOLARA
If youre worried about money this
is all paid for The whole night

ELI
Its not that Youre a very nice
girl But Im not that kind of man

She slides off the bed approaches him Begins to work the
buttons of his shirt

SOLARA
Theyre all that kind of man
He moves her hand away Gently pushes her back a step
ELI
Im not

She is stunned No man has ever turned her down before And
then she seems a little insulted

SOLARA
They told me you were crazy Maybe
they were right

Eli opens the door for her

ELI
m sorry Good night

Suddenly all her other emotions give way to fear She moves
to the door and slams it shut again Looks Eli in the eye

SOLARA
Please dont make me leave I have
to stay the night If I dont

ELI
£ you dont what

SOLARA
Hell hurt my mom

ELI
Who will Carnegie

She nods fighting back a tear This angers Eli

ELI
Maybe he and I oughta have words

He goes for the door handle but she stops him

SOLARA
No Please dont

ELI
Hes hurting you Hes hurting your
mother Hes-

SOLARA
Hes my dad

BEAT Eli moves his hand away from the door
SOLARA

Look if you want to help me just
let me stay here tonight We dont
have to do anything Ill sleep on
the floor Tomorrow you can tell my
dad that we had a good time Ill
be no trouble I swear

She looks up at Eli im

ploringly Transformed No longer the

teenage sex kitten Now shes just a frightened little girl

ELI

You want to have a conversation

She smiles

LATER

Eli and Solara sit together on the bed A silent BEAT

wiping the tear from her cheek

first it appears as though they have nothing to say

She smiles

Eli smiles

ELI
You know you dont have to be
afraid of me What happened down
there in the bar

SOLARA
Im not afraid of you I know you
didnt start that trouble When I
first saw you I knew you werent
the type to go looking for it

ELI
Howd you know that

SOLARA
My mom says Im a good judge of
character She says I can read
people That I know a good man when
I see one

At

Eli is surprised to find himself smiling back

SOLARA
So youre pretty old right

amused by the bluntness of the question

SOLARA
Im sorry I just mean I havent
seen too many people your age How
old are you exactly

ELI
You know I dont rightly remember

SOLARA
But youre old enough I mean you
remember what it was like In the
world before

Eli nods

SOLARA
What was it like

Eli thinks about this Dredging through old old memories

ELI
Better than this
(BEAT)
People lived longer back then
Longer than me Some were more than
a hundred years old

Solara smiles like shes having her leg pulled

SOLARA
Come on

ELI
I swear its true Nowadays its
not the same If youre sick or
youre weak or youre old you wont
last long out on the road

SOLARA
So how come you have

BEAT Eli thinks Should he or shouldnt he

ELI
Can I read you something

SOLARA
Wait You can read
Eli pulls the book from his shirt Solaras eyes widen

SOLARA
And you have a book
ELI
Not just any book

For the first time we see that its a KING JAMES BIBLE
embossed GOLD CROSS on its old leather cover

Eli opens it up scans the page with his finger until he
finds the passage hes looking for

ELI
The Lord is my shepherd I shall
not want He makes me lie down in
green pastures He leads me beside
still waters He restores my soul
He leads me in the paths of
righteousness

ON SOLARA as she listens to Eli read Transfixed

ELI
Though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death I will fear no
evil For you are with me Your rod
and your staff they comfort me
You prepare a table before me in
the presence of my enemies You
anoint my head with oil My cup
runs over Surely goodness and
mercy shall follow me all the days
of my life And I will dwell in the
house of the Lord forever

SOLARA
Thats beautiful Did you write
that
ELI
(SMILES)
No
SOLARA

What book is it from Is it poetry

ELI
I guess you could think of it that
way Its from the Holy Bible

SOLARA
I never heard of it Whats it
about

BEAT as Eli thinks How on earth to answer that

ELI
Its about love and forgiveness
and life and death and mercy and
revenge and the beginning and the
end of the world I guess its
about a little bit of everything

SOLARA
Can I see

She reaches out for the book but he snatches it away

SOLARA
What Im not going to do anything

ELI
Im sorry Im charged to protect
this book I cant trust it with
anyone Not even for a while

SOLARA
Whats so special about that book

BEAT Eli runs his fingers across the embossed gold cross on
the beat-up leather cover

ELI
Its the last one There are no
other books like this All the
others are gone - destroyed by the
war or in the burnings that came
after This is the only one that
survived until now The last one
anywhere

SOLARA
How can you know that

ELI
I just know
(BEAT)
For a long while after it happened
I just wandered on the road like
most everybody else There were
still a lot of people around back
then in the beginning I didnt
really know what I should do or
where I was going I was just
moving from place to place trying
to stay alive And then one day I
heard this voice I dont know how
to explain it its like it was
coming from inside me But I could
hear it clear as day Clear as I
can hear you talking to me now

SOLARA
What did it say

ELI
It led me to this place I dont
really know where And I found this
book buried deep under some rubble
No way no-one was ever going to
find it if they didnt know exactly
where to look

SOLARA
But you knew because the voice told
you

ELI
Thats right And that voice told
me to carry the book west

(MORE)

ELI (contd)

It told me that a path would be
laid out before me that Id be led
to a place where this book would be
safe It told me Id be protected
against anyone or anything that
tried to stand in my way If only I
would have faith

(BEAT)
That was twenty-five years ago And
Ive been walking ever since

SOLARA
(SKEPTICAL)

Because a voice you heard in your
head told you to

ELI
Im not crazy I didnt imagine it
I know what I heard

SOLARA
So who was it The voice

BEAT as Eli considers his answer

BEAT

The

ELI
A very important very powerful
man

SOLARA
More powerful than my dad

ELI
(SMILES)
I should say so yes

two of them sit in silence for a moment

SOLARA
Would you teach me to read

ELI
What

SOLARA
I never learned No-one around here
knows how Only my dad and he
wont teach me I think he likes
being the only one who can read I
think it makes him feel powerful

ELI
I think youre probably right

SOLARA
So would you teach me

ELI
Im sorry Im leaving tomorrow
And I wont be back this way ever

She looks down sad She likes this guy She doesnt want
him
to leave Eli can sense her sadness

ELI
Are you hungry

SOLARA
I guess a little

ELI
Theres some food on the table over
there Lets eat

She walks over to where the dinner tray is covered by a
small

cloth She whips it away - to reveal ELIS RAT nibbling on a

piece of cheese Solara SHRIEKS and backs away

The rat scurries down the table leg and leaps up onto Elis
shoulder just as afraid of her as she is of it

ELI
Its okay its okay Hes with me
(to the rat)

Dont be afraid pal This is
Solara Shes our friend

Solara approaches warily Reaches out and strokes him The
rat scurries up her arm She almost shrieks again

ELI
Its okay It means he likes you

SOLARA
It does
ELI
Trust me if he didnt like you
youd know about it

Solara pets the rat on her shoulder Then

SOLARA
Did you really mean that

ELI
Mean what

SOLARA
That Im your friend

BEAT Eli finds himself surprised that he admitted such a
thing When is the last time he had someone he could call a
friend He cant even remember

ELI
Sure

She smiles Giggles as the rats whiskers tickle her ear

Eli breaks the cheese in two and gives half to Solara Shes
about to eat but stops as Eli clasp his hands in prayer

ELI
Our father we thank you for this
meal which you have been so
gracious to place before us

Unsure of what to do Solara mimics Eli putting her hands
together and bowing her head

ELI
We thank you for a warm bed and a
roof over our heads on a cold night
such as this
(BEAT)
And we thank you for the gift of
friendship in these hard times

Solara looks at him touched by that

ELI
Amen
(BEAT)
You say that last part too

SOLARA
Amen And now we eat

ELI
And now we eat

They sit and eat together sharing the simple meal

PULL OUT from the window as they eat away from the theater
Away from the town and its flickering points of torchlight
Moving farther and farther away until the entire town is

consumed by the darkness of the world

EXT DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAWN
The pale sun rises over the town To establish

INT PALLADIUM - DINING ROOM - MORNING
What was once the theaters COSTUME ROOM - OLD MANNEQUINS
still stand around in the corners creating an eerie feel
Carnegie and Claudia sit at a DINING TABLE eating breakfast
in silence A third place is set but no-one is seated
there

Solara enters and sits down without a word

CARNEGIE
Good morning Solara

Solara doesnt say anything

CARNEGIE
I said good morning Solara

SOLARA
Morning dad

CARNEGIE
How was your night Did you sleep
well

Claudia appears perturbed by Carnegies subtle probing
Solara flashes him a frosty look

SOLARA
I did like you asked Isnt that
what you really want to know Just
come out and say it

Carnegie glares at her sternly

CARNEGIE
You dont speak to your father like
that When I ask you a civil
question I expect a civil answer

Solara lowers her head scorned Carnegie continues eating

CARNEGIE
Did he say anything
SOLARA
No We didnt talk much

CARNEGIE
Well do you think you managed to
change his mind about staying

SOLARA
I dont know He said he had to go

Carnegie puts down his food looks angrily at her

CARNEGIE
So he did talk What else did he
say Come on I want all of it

SOLARA
Thats all he said That he was
going to be leaving this morning

CARNEGIE
Well see This is my town nobody
leaves until I say they leave

He glances knowingly at Claudia

CLAUDIA
Solara honey eat something

She looks at the food on the plate before her Then closes
her eyes and clasps her hands in prayer

SOLARA
Our father thank you for this meal
which you have been so gracious to
place before us

Claudia and Carnegie freeze Carnegie stares at her agape

SOLARA
Thank you for my mother Please
watch over her and keep her safe

CARNEGIE
Solara

SOLARA
Thank you for all the-
CARNEGIE
Solara

She snaps suddenly out of it looks at her father

CARNEGIE
What the hell are you doing

She doesnt respond Looks embarrassed

CARNEGIE
God didnt put this food on the
table Do you hear me
(BEAT)
Who put this food on the table

Solara says nothing just looks down at the table

CARNEGIE
I said who put this food on the
table

SOLARA
(SOFTLY)
You did

CARNEGIE
Who taught you that

SOLARA
Eli taught me

CARNEGIE
(PUZZLED)
Who the hell is Eli

SOLARA
The walker Thats his name

CARNEGIE
And he taught you how to say those
words How did he know them

SOLARA
He had them written down in a book

This piques Carnegies interest greatly

CARNEGIE
What kind of a book

He barks the question at her Solara is rattled

SOLARA
I dont remember It was an old
leather book It had kind of a
thing on the front of it

CARNEGIE
Show me

Solara makes the SIGN OF A CRUCIFIX with her index fingers
Carnegies eyes widen he can barely believe it

CARNEGIE
He had a bible

SOLARA
Thats what it was A holy bible
Daddy whats wrong Did I

Carnegie BOLTS SUDDENLY FROM THE TABLE overturning his
chair
and sending his plate of food crashing to the floor

INT PALLADIUM - LOBBY BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

Carnegie races across the landing toward the ARMED GUARD
posted outside Elis bedroom The guard steps aside as
Carnegie flings the door open and barges inside

INT PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Empty No sign of Eli or his gear anywhere The window is
WIDE OPEN the curtains fluttering gently in the breeze

INT ENGINEER WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS

His hands shaking the engineer disconnects Elis battery
from the generator and places it on the counter

Eli stands on the other side of the counter with his SHOTGUN
TRAINED RIGHT AT THE MANS HEAD He takes the battery from
him and stuffs it into his backpack

EXT PALLADIUM - CONTINUOUS

Carnegie races from the lobby entrance and looks up at the
open window to Elis room He could have easily jumped
sidewalk

wings

Redridge emerges onto the street behind him

REDRIDGE
Something wrong boss

CARNEGIE
Something wrong Something wrong
The walkers gone

REDRIDGE
That cant be I had a man outside
his room the whole time

CARNEGIE
He jumped out the window you
idiot You didnt think to put a
man outside the fucking window
(beat fuming)
Find him Now

REDRIDGE
Boss he could be anywhere He
(REALIZATION)
A battery Didnt he say something
about a battery

They turn to face the engineers storefront - just as ELI
EMERGES ONTO THE STREET shotgun still in his hand

EVERYBODY FREEZES Like a wild west stand-off Redridges
fingers play over the butt of the pistol on his hip

BEAT as time hangs perfectly still for a second and then
ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE

Redridge draws and FIRES SHATTERING A PARKING METER just
inches from Eli and showering quarters all over the

Eli rushes along the sidewalk RETURNING FIRE The shot
Redridge in the shoulder He goes down wounded

Carnegie dives for cover as FOUR MORE GUNMEN rush from the
theater Carnegie waves frantically in Elis direction

CARNEGIE
Go Go

They spot Eli sprinting away and rush off in pursuit

Carnegie gets to his feet and storms back inside the

INT PALLADIUM - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Solara and Claudia watch through the window Turn suddenly
when they hear the door slam open behind them

Carnegie stands in the doorway glaring at them
EXT DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

LOCAL RESIDENTS scream and rush to and fro in panic as Eli
darts along the boardwalk

CARNEGIES GUNMEN pursue firing their rifles wildly on the
run The bullets splinter wood pierce barrels and crates
narrowly missing Eli as he dashes keeping his head down
Eli aims the shotgun and FIRES without even looking The
HITS A GUNMAN SQUARE IN THE CHEST dropping him to the dirt

Eli hits the deck diving for cover behind a JUNKPILE as

gunfire ricochets all around him He takes a moment to
collect himself reloads the shotgun

The three remaining gunmen close in on the junkpile warily
Eli signs a cross over himself with the shotgun looks to
sky and offers up a silent prayer Then emerges from around
the junkpile back into the street All three gunmen OPEN

FIRE their bullets whipping past on either side of him

In one swift motion Eli raises the shotgun and FIRES Three
shots in quick succession And then there is silence Smoke
wisps from the shotguns sawn-off barrel

The three gunmen LIE DEAD IN THE STREET One hit square in
the chest The other two each have maybe one half of their

heads remaining

Eli looks around Hes right at the end of the main road
this

shotgun

perimeter where the town meets the open desert Hes free
And then A GIRLS SCREAM Distant but unmistakable

Eli whips around In the upstairs window of the theater
Carnegie shoves Solara roughly against the wall Barking
angrily at her shaking her

Eli looks at the road Then up at the theater Then back to
the road again

ELI
(quietly to himself)
It aint your concern Stay on the
path

But he sounds less resolute now than before Until today
was always a simple decision for him to make But now

ELI
Dammit

He marches back toward the theater stepping over the fallen
bodies of the gunmen re-loading his shotgun as he goes

EXT PALLADIUM - CONTINUOUS

Redridge finally manages to clamber back up to his feet
wincing as he clutches his painful shoulder wound

He looks up just in time to see Eli coming right at him
Without breaking stride he COLD-COCKS Redridge in the jaw
with the shotgun sending him back to the deck out cold

INT PALLADIUM - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Eli kicks the door wide open finds Carnegie holding Solara
against the wall She sobs terrified Eli levels the

at Carnegies head

ELI
Let her go

CARNEGIE
That cannon of yours casts a pretty
wide net I dont reckon you can
hit me without hitting her
ELI
I reckon youre right

He holsters the shotgun Then in the same fluid motion draws
a PISTOL from his belt that we never even knew he had

ELI
This though With this Ill shave
the hairs clean off your balls ata
hundred paces You believe me

Carnegie releases his grip on Solara steps away hands up

CARNEGIE
I believe you I have to say Im
surprised to hear that language
coming from you though I mean
you being a holy man and all

BEAT Eli glances at Solara

CARNEGIE
She told me all about it Told me
all about the bible too
(BEAT)
Can I see it

ELI
No

Carnegie takes a small step forward Suddenly his whole
demeanor changes and he now looks at Eli imploringly

CARNEGIE
You know Ive been searching for a
book like that one for years All
Ive ever wanted was to bring the
word of God to these poor
unfortunates here To shine its
light upon them and give them
something in this wretched world
that they could believe in
Something to live for Its why I
built this town did you know that
All weve been missing is the word
to show us the way And now praise
the Lord youve brought it to us

Carnegie takes a step closer He appears entirely sincere -
but then he is very good at doing so

CARNEGIE
Its not right to keep that book
hidden away all to yourself The
word is meant to be shared with
others Its meant to be spread
Isnt that what you want I could
help you do that You and me we
could do it together

BEAT Eli seems to be considering what hes heard carefully

ELI
The Lord himself told me that if I
carried this book west one day I
would find the place where it was
needed Where it would be safe
Where it belonged

Carnegie smiles broadly and then with a sudden blur of
movement Eli PISTOL-WHIPS him to the floor

ELI
But this aint it

He turns to Solara and offers her his hand

ELI
Come on

EXT PALLADIUM - CONTINUOUS

Eli emerges from the theater leading Solara onto the
street

RESIDENTS part before them staring at Eli with
astonishment

Eli passes the statue of Carnegie - and STOPS Something
about that thing is bothering him

SOLARA
What What is it

ELI
You shall not make for yourself any
graven image

He turns drawing his samurai sword and in the same fluid
motion SLICING across the base of the statue

and

slow

BEAT And then the STATUE TOPPLES from the neat cut just
below the knees CRASHING DOWN to the ground and SHATTERING
The assembled residents GASP at this defiant display

Eli sheathes his sword and takes Solara by the hand again

ELI
Now we can go

CRANE UP over the main street as they both head out of town
EXT ROAD - DAY

The town barely visible on the distant horizon behind Eli
Solara Eli walks as he always has his pace steady and
Still Solara lags along behind Shes already tired

SOLARA
Where are we going

ELI
I told you where Im going Youre
free to go wherever you want

She stops in the road

SOLARA
Wait Im not coming with you

ELI
Youre only going to slow me down

Eli doesnt stop walking Solara is forced to catch up

SOLARA
So what the hell was all that about
back there

ELI
The man was hurting you I dont
like that so I put a stop to it
Now youre free He cant hurt you
any more
(off her stare)
No need to thank me
SOLARA
Thank you For what What am I
supposed to do now

ELI
Whatever you want Thats what
being free is

SOLARA
Whatever I want Except go with
you

ELI

I have to get where Im going I
cant be worrying about someone
else along the way

Solara is incredibly hurt by this Blinks back a tear

SOLARA
I thought you were my friend

BEAT Eli stops and turns back to face her

ELI
Its dangerous in the outland I
wouldnt want you to get hurt

SOLARA
Ill be safe so long as Im with
you I know it

Eli sighs Hes not getting through to her So now comes the
harsh truth of it

ELI
You dont want this life I gotta
do what I gotta do Dont have no
choice in it But you do And I
cant let you choose this You
dont want to be like me You dont
want to spend your life alone

Solara steps closer her eyes pleading
SOLARA

If I came with you I wouldnt be
alone And neither would you
A long BEAT as Eli considers this For a moment it appears

as
though Solara might have won him over But then
ELI
Im sorry Look maybe its best
you just go on back to town
He turns and walks off leaving her in the road She stands
there furious screaming at his back as he walks away
SOLARA
Fine Ill do just that I had a
life there A family I didnt ask
you to save me I didnt ask you
for anything

He doesnt turn or acknowledge her at all Just keeps
walking

off into the horizon Getting smaller all the time
Solara stands there in the road weeping All alone

SOLARA
(SOFTLY)
Fine

She turns and walks back in the direction she came
EXT DESERT TOWN - BARNYARD - DAY

A small penned-in area to the rear of the Palladium
containing an eclectic bunch of farmyard animals Goats
sheep geese pigs Mostly mangy sad-looking specimens

Carnegie stands in the yard tossing handfuls of animal feed

from a nearby sack onto the ground He watches with
satisfaction as the animals gather at his feet to feed

Claudia emerges from the theater with an ice-pack

CARNEGIE
Thank you darling

Carnegie applies it to his jaw red and swollen from Elis
pistol-whip Redridge appears nearby his arm ina sling

REDRIDGE
He killed four of my men and walked
out of town without a scratch They
shot off a hundred rounds at him
and he didnt get hit once I never
even heard of anything like that

Carnegie doesnt appear to be listening He is lost ina
world of his own as he tends to the farm animals

CARNEGIE
You know I always thought of
myself as a shepherd Bringing
together the wayward and the lost
Tending to my flock But all the
things I want to do I cant do
them on my own The one thing Ive
needed is the one thing thats
always been missing Then one day
it walks right into town - so close
I can almost touch it - and then
walks right on out again

Carnegie finally looks up from his animals at Redridge

CARNEGIE
I want you to put a crew together
and go out after him

REDRIDGE
Hes not going to work for you I
think hes made that plain

CARNEGIE
Im not interested in him any more
I only want the book hes carrying

REDRIDGE
If Im gonna risk my ass hunting
down this maniac in the outland I
need to know its gonna be worth
it I need to know whats so
special about this goddamn book

BEAT as Carnegie considers this

CARNEGIE
You have no idea Youre too young
you dont remember the world
before But I do I remember
He turns back to his animals summoning up old memories

CARNEGIE

When I was a kid my parents used to
read that book every goddamn day
My mother shed read it along with
this smooth-talking preacher on the
TV screen They used to be able to
beam these guys right into your
house into every house in the
world through the air Like magic

(BEAT)
She worked two jobs and she sent
every spare penny she had to that
fucking guy on the TV My old man
hed read that book then hed get
liquored up and kick my ass tell
me all about the power and the
glory and how I was going to burn
forever in hell for the sins I was
born with He made sure he beat it
into me good

He snaps out of his reverie and looks at Redridge

CARNEGIE
Dont you see Its not just any
book

(MORE)

CARNEGIE (contd)

It has the power to motivate
people It can give them hope it
can terrify them It can shape
them Control them

(BEAT)
Do you remember how I built this
town It wasnt done with force
and it wasnt done just with water
It was done with the power of
words I created this place out of
nothing because people believed in
a promise that I sold to them
Those guys on the TV they were
richer than you could ever dream
and it was all built the same way
With words With promises And with
that book

(BEAT)
That book is a weapon Aimed right
has

As usual

at the hearts and minds of the weak
and the desperate Just imagine
what I could do with it

REDRIDGE
Boss were running out of water
and the people are running out of
patience Youre trying to tell me
that a book is going to keep them
in line

CARNEGIE
Oh itll do much more than that
The water in this town may run dry
but faith - that springs eternal
And that faith will help turn this
town into a city And this city
into a nation It will help me
build a new world In my image
People will come from far and wide
to hear whats inside of it
Theyll follow me anywhere just to
get a taste of it And theyll do
whatever I tell them

Carnegies slick rhetoric has worked - Redridge

totally bought into it Claudia however looks appalled

REDRIDGE
And what if this book dont work
What if it dont say what you want
it to say

CARNEGIE

Oh itll say what I want I can
promise you that Because Im going
to rewrite it Ill keep the parts
that work for me and make the rest
whatever I need it to be

(BEAT)
A new bible for a new world

He reaches out and takes Claudia by the hand

CARNEGIE
What do you think darling A whole
new world to do with as we will
Wont that be grand

he

around

She smiles halfheartedly but its clear she is mortified

Carnegie turns back to Redridge

CARNEGIE
Find that book

REDRIDGE
He has half a day on us already

CARNEGIE
So use the motor pool

REDRIDGE
There aint much gas in reserve

CARNEGIE
Whatever there is use it

Redridge nods and goes to leave

CLAUDIA
What about Solara

BEAT In all this excitement about the book she had been
completely forgotten about

CLAUDIA
Shes still out there With him

CARNEGIE
Right Right Of course Bring her

back too if you can But-

REDRIDGE
The book I know

Redridge turns and leaves Claudia scowls at Carnegie but
doesnt even notice just goes back to feeding his animals
EXT DESOLATE ROAD - DAY

Solara wanders the road Shes tired The sun beats down
mercilessly Nothing but desolation and wasteland all
road

She comes to a FORK IN THE ROAD Stops at the junction
unsure Was this here before She doesnt remember

There are no signs Both paths look the same Which one is
which She turns and looks back looks around Shes lost

SOLARA
Shit Shit

She alternates her finger between the two paths Eeny-meeny-
miney-moe Picks a path and follows it headed down the

EXT ROAD - DAY

Eli walks on Slow and steady His gaze as ever fixed
firmly on the horizon Takes a swig from his canteen

Suddenly he STOPS and stands stock still in the center of
the road Impossible to know what hes thinking

He stands there for a long time
EXT WASTELAND GAS STATION - DAY

Solara comes upon an abandoned CHEVRON STATION She doesnt
remember passing this Looks back up and down the road

SOLARA
Where the hell am I

Theres a RUSTED CAR parked at one of the pumps Like every
other car weve seen stripped of its tires and engine

She walks around to the drivers side A PETRIFIED FEMALE
BODY lies on the ground half-in half-out of the car

Solara claps her hand to her mouth and recoils horrified

In the dead womans hand is a dusty bottle of MINERAL WATER
Solara hesitates Not wanting to get closer But so thirsty

She braces herself grimacing and tries to take the bottle
but the dead womans hand is closed tight around it She
pulls harder and wrenches it free In the process she falls
on her butt and flips the corpse over onto its back

In the other womans arm she has a SKELETAL BABY cradled to
her bosom It seems to be staring right at Solara
here

Solara SCREAMS and frantically shuffles backward away from
it Gets to her feet and runs across the forecourt

She stops by the station shop and rests against the wall
hyperventilating heart pounding Trying to get it together

She inspects the water in the bottle It looks clean
Unscrews the cap with shaking hands and takes a sip

She SPITS IT BACK OUT coughing Its rank Undrinkable
INT WASTELAND GAS STATION - FOOD COURT - DAY

Solara enters Gloomy inside Comprehensively looted Empty
shelves coated in thick sheets of dust

She moves further in searching for something anything But
the place has been gutted Theres nothing She checks the
wall of dead refrigerators Shattered glass all empty

Shes never known desolation and emptiness like this Its
beginning to scare her She wheels around in a panic

FEMALE VOICE (0S)
Hello

Distant calling from outside Solara hears it and freezes

FEMALE VOICE (0S)
Hello Can anyone help me

EXT WASTELAND GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS
She runs out across the forecourt onto the road
A FEMALE FIGURE is hunched by the side of the road about
fifty yards up ahead Hard to see what shes doing from
SLUMPED FEMALE
Hello Is anybody there
Solara starts walking toward her

The woman has her back to Solara Shes on her knees
muttering to herself Gathering objects up from the road

As Solara moves closer we see that the woman is struggling
with an UPTURNED SHOPPING CART Stuck in a roadside ditch
its contents spilled out next to a few BRACKEN BUSHES
it

Every
on
from

way

We see her face now Its the SAME YOUNG WOMAN from before
The same shopping cart The same trap

SOLARA
Are you all right

The woman looks around sees Solara standing nearby Shes
shocked to see that its a girl

YOUNG WOMAN
Oh Yes Im fine Thank you You
go along Ill be okay

SOLARA
You look like you need some help

YOUNG WOMAN
No really Im fine Really I
need a man to help Not you You
just keep along Please
The woman seems anxious to get rid of her Tries to indicate
the threat silently with her eyes but Solara doesnt get
SOLARA
Itll just take a minute

She steps into the ditch and starts to haul the cart out

YOUNG WOMAN
Really its fine Please

Too late THREE ROAD BRIGANDS POUNCE FROM THE BUSHES
bit as brutish and horrifying as the group that Eli killed
the road in our opening They grab Solara and drag her
the road into the desert screaming and kicking all the
YOUNG WOMAN
Let her go She aint got nothing
The BRIGAND LEADER looks Solara up and down lustfully

BRIGAND LEADER
I aint too sure about that

Solara is reviled by the man Hes filthy his stench
overpowering One eye missing just a dark empty socket He
licks his lips revealing a mouth almost devoid of teeth

YOUNG WOMAN
This wasnt the deal

The brigand leader lashes out and grabs her by the throat

BRIGAND LEADER
Shut your mouth bitch You oughta
be grateful youre getting a break

He releases her She slumps to the dirt whimpering

BRIGAND LEADER
Never did care much for that dried-
up old snatch anyhow

He looks back to the struggling Solara
BRIGAND LEADER
This one though this one looks
fresh You a virgin

She says nothing just sobs helplessly

BRIGAND LEADER
Well lets find out

He unbuckles his pants lets them drop to his ankles

We hear a sound Its hard to place Something like a THHUP
The brigand leader is frozen in shock His face goes pale
the blood draining from it The two bandits holding Solara
look at their leader in dismay Staring down at his crotch
A quiet whimper escapes from his lips as he looks down
There is an ARROW IMBEDDED IN HIS CROTCH What was once down
there is now just a bloody mess of mangled meat More blood

streams down his thighs A real horror show

He staggers backward shrieking Hands shaking Staring down
at the awful wound from which the long arrow shaft extends
angel

HIS

RUSHES

Almost

The two other brigands release Solara and whip around
scanning the horizon They see nothing One of them has a
RIFLE He unslings it and aims it frantically around

Then they both see it Coming right at them The most
terrifying thing either has ever seen

ELI WALKING TOWARD THEM FROM THE ROAD OUT OF THE SUN His
silhouette distorted in the rippling heat An avenging

He pulls another arrow and draws it back as the rifle bandit
trains his weapon on him finger tightening on the trigger
Eli SHOOTS The arrow sails through the air and RIGHT INTO
THE RIFLE BARREL The feathers at the end of the shaft

plugging the muzzle tight

Rifle bandit pulls the trigger The gun EXPLODES BLOWING
HANDS CLEAN OFF He falls to the ground screaming

Eli only had two arrows He shoulders the bow and draws his
sword All the remaining brigand has is a small knife The
two now square off at arms length A hopeless mismatch

BEAT The knife brigand hesitates trembling And then

ELI WITH THE KNIFE Eli deftly sidesteps flourishes the
sword So quick it almost seems like he didnt move at all

The knife bandit staggers forward a couple more steps His
hand goes limp and drops the knife

And then his HEAD FALLS BACKWARD like a Pez dispenser

completely decapitated but not quite Blood fountains from
the neck stump as his body falls to the dirt

Eli moves to the other two bandits who lay horribly wounded
on the ground but still breathing He stands over their
fallen bodies They stare back up at him helpless

He crouches down between them in the dust

ELI
I offer you both one final chance
in this life to seek forgiveness
for your sins so that your souls
may find salvation Will you say
with me the act of contrition

The brigand leader defiantly spits blood at him

BRIGAND LEADER
Fuck you

Eli sighs Stands and looks down on him without pity

ELI
Some might think itd be most
fitting to leave you here like
this Let you die slow in the sun
But I know better I know where
youre going And the sooner you
get there the sooner youll get
whats coming to you

He plunges his sword into the bandit leader finishing him

off Pulls the arrow from his crotch and wipes it clean

He turns to the other man raising his sword

RIFLE BANDIT
Wait

Eli pauses sword hovering over him poised to strike

RIFLE BANDIT
I want to say it I want to be
forgiven

Eli crouches once more by his side

ELI
Repeat after me Oh God I am
heartily sorry for having offended
thee and I detest all my sins

The bandit follows along with Eli mouthing the words
quietly The life ebbing from him with each moment

ELI
I firmly resolve with the help of
thy grace to confess my sins and
do penance and to amend my life
Amen

and

tighter

RIFLE BANDIT
Amen

His eyes roll back as his final breath leaves him Dead Eli
signs a cross over his body then stands and walks away

Solara sits on the ground nearby a wreck Eli approaches
gathers her up in his arms She clings on to him tightly

SOLARA
You came back for me

ELI
What are friends for

She laughs a tear rolling down her cheek Grips him

He helps her up and escorts her back to the road

ELI
This is the deal You keep up You
pull your weight You fall behind
I cant help you Okay

SOLARA
Okay

She looks back at the young woman still slumped in the dirt

SOLARA
What about her

ELI
Theres nothing can be done for
her
They walk on down the road
EXT DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY
METAL GARAGE DOORS roll back to reveal darkness within

A PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS fires up Full beam right at us

A VEHICLE roars out of the darkness onto the street Heavily
its

modified with plate armor and turret-mounted weapons But
original form still recognizable underneath

Its a HONDA ODYSSEY minivan Once the 1 choice of soccer
moms transformed now into an armored personnel carrier

Another minivan roars from the garage behind it A DODGE
GRAND CARAVAN similarly customized and armed to the teeth

THREE MORE CARS follow As eclectic an assortment as you
could imagine A MINI COOPER FORD EXPLORER A PRIUS Each
adorned with plate armor and weapons

In the lead Minivan is REDRIDGE heavily armed He nods to
the DRIVER who guns the engine

The fleet of armored vehicles moves out kicking up a great
funnel of dust in their wake as they roar out of town

EXT DESERT - DAY

Late afternoon The sun hangs low on the horizon Were far
from the road Nothing but scrub brush and a few PRAIRIE DOG
BURROWS dotted around

A PRAIRIE DOG pops its head up scans the horizon Sniffing
the air whiskers twitching and is SKEWERED BY AN ARROW

Thirty yards away one of the pieces of scrub brush appears
to COME ALIVE And then we realize it is Elis GHILLIE SUIT
camouflaging both he and Solara beneath it

Eli casts off the camouflage net and walks toward the dead
prairie dog Solara just stands there appalled

SOLARA
You killed it That cute little
thing

Eli picks up the dead animal by the scruff

ELI
Its good eating is what it is

He yanks out the bloody arrow Solara looks away
the

down

bites

When she turns back Eli is standing right there holding

dead animal in front of her face She YELPS in surprise and
staggers backward falling on her butt

SOLARA
Thats not funny

ELI
If youre going to be on the road
you cant be picky about what you
eat You eat whats there to eat

SOLARA
Im not eating that

ELI
(SHRUGS)
More for me

EXT WASTELAND CAVE - DUSK

Eli and Solara sit in the mouth of a desert cave around a
flickering campfire The prairie dog roasts on a spit

Eli digs his knife into the carcass the blade comes out
clean Its done He clasps his hands together and gazes

penitently at the ground

ELI
Father we thank you for your
generosity in providing us with
this meal Bless this food to our
use and us to thy service and keep
us ever mindful of the needs of
others Amen

Eli carves off a piece of meat Juicy and succulent He

into it teasing Solara by making a show of how good it
tastes He feeds a piece to the rat perched on his shoulder

Solara tries to appear uninterested but shes starved

SOLARA
What does that taste like

He takes another bite thinks on this as he chews

ELI
Tastes like chicken

She tries to fight the temptation to try it but she
cant

She reaches out and tears off a piece Sniffs at it takes a

small bite then quickly wolfs down the rest Eli smiles

As she eats she gestures toward Elis Saint Christopher

SOLARA
What is that

Eli reaches up and touches his hand to it

ELI
Its a Saint Christopher medal

SOLARA
Whos Saint Christopher Is he a
character from your book

Eli smiles and shakes his head

ELI

Christopher was a man who lived a
long time ago He wanted to be a
good man he wanted to help people
So he would stand by a river that
had no bridge and carry people
across He was a big strong man and
there was no one he couldnt carry

Solara listens rapt Eli is a good storyteller

ELI
Then one day a young child came to
the river and asked to be carried
across Christopher tried to carry
him but he was too heavy He was
just a small boy but he was heavier
than any man he had ever carried
The boy explained that he was the
son of God and that he was so
heavy because he bore all the sins
of the world After that
Christopher was able to carry him
across and when they got to the
other side the boy baptized him in
the river And thats how he became
a saint Later on he was known as

the patron saint of travelers

SOLARA
What is a saint anyway

ELI
Its someone who spent their life
doing good things for others
Enough that God himself took a
special interest in them

Solara looks at Eli tenderly with admiration

SOLARA
Someone like you

Eli looks away down at the ground He appears sad

ELI
No Not like me Saints aint
killers And I done too much of
that Spilled too much blood

BEAT No words just the flickering firelight

SOLARA
Will you read me some more from the
book

ELI

Its late You should get some
sleep Maybe tomorrow

LATER - NIGHT

The fire down to its last embers Eli sleeps next to his
pack half-hidden in the looming shadows of the cave His

hat

and goggles hung up for the night on the hilt of his sword

Solara sleeps nearby then opens her eyes Not asleep
after

all She looks over at Eli - his face hidden in shadow and
so

impossible to tell if hes asleep or awake

SOLARA
Eli
No response Quietly she moves forward kneeling by his
side She opens his coat and checks the pockets Empty

She goes deeper peeling back the layers of clothing
stealthily frisking him She finds something on his lapel
hidden under several layers that causes her to stop

Its a RECTANGULAR PLASTIC BADGE The red white and blue
colors faded and worn It reads

WELCOME TO WAL-MART
MY NAME IS ELI
HOW MAY I HELP YOU

She stares at it for a moment not knowing what to make of
it Then moves on continuing to pat him down

Whatever shes looking for is not here She turns her
attention to the backpack Slowly carefully opens it up

There it is THE BIBLE wrapped carefully in its neat little
package of cloth and twine She reaches in for it

Suddenly ELIS HAND SHOOTS OUT AND GRABS HER BY THE WRIST
She cries out startled Eli sits up his face just a dark
shape in the shadows For the first time he appears a little
scary to Solara

ELI
What are you doing

SOLARA
You scared me I thought you were
asleep

ELI

On the road you sleep with one eye
open I asked you what you were
doing

SOLARA
I just wanted to see the book

ELI
You want to see the book you ask
me Nobody touches it but me Ever
Until it gets where its going Do
you understand
it

road

Hes very forceful She nods a little afraid of him

ELI
Tell me you understand

He grips her wrist tighter

SOLARA
Okay I understand Ow

Eli releases her wrist Takes the pack from her and closes
up Pulls it closer to him and lies back down

ELI
Its no use to you anyway You
dont know how to read it

SOLARA
Well now we have the time maybe
you can teach me

ELI
Maybe Get some sleep

She lies back down beside him but doesnt close her eyes
She just lies there watching him

EXT WASTELAND - DAWN

The sun rises out of the east And out of the sun comes the
FLEET OF ARMORED VEHICLES Racing side-by-side down the

The lead vehicle comes to a halt A door opens and Redridge
gets out MORE ARMED MEN emerge from the other vehicles and
follow him as he marches into the wasteland by the roadside

The DEAD BRIGANDS are splayed out in the dirt where Eli slew
them A FLOCK OF BUZZARDS is picking their bones clean

REDRIDGE
Hes been here

Redridge looks at the footprints in the dirt headed from the
bodies and back onto the road Two sets of tracks

REDRIDGE
The girls with him
He moves back to the cars

REDRIDGE
Move out

The other men hold for a moment still looking at the half-
eaten bodies in the dirt Redridge turns back

REDRIDGE
I said move out

CARNEGIE GUNMAN
I heard this guys protected
somehow some power from up
above That there aint nothing on
this earth can touch him

REDRIDGE
Hes just a man You put a bullet
in him hell go down like any
other I dont want to hear no more
of this superstitious horseshit

Hesitantly they make their way back to the vehicles The
cars gun their engines and move on down the road past the
abandoned Chevron station Dust pluming in their wake

EXT ROAD - DAY

Eli and Solara walk together passing by a few burned-out
buildings It appears we might be headed toward a town

Solara looks up at the sweltering sun Then around at her
surroundings Nothing but devastation and decay

SOLARA
You say youve been walking for
twenty-five years Have you ever
considered that you might be lost

ELI
No

SOLARA
But how can you know How can you

know this is the right way

ELI
I told you My path has been laid
out before me

SOLARA
Yeah but laid out by who

ELI
By Almighty God

SOLARA
Well if this God guys so mighty
how come its taking you so long to
get where youre going Doesnt he
know the way

Eli wheels around and jabs a scolding finger at her

ELI
You want to stay on this road with
me dont ever let me hear you take
his name in vain like that again

Solara is surprised by the severity of his reaction

SOLARA
Sorry

Eli resumes walking

ELI
God has a reason for everything
being the way it is Its not
always apparent to us But it is
his plan nonetheless

SOLARA
So is he talking to you right now
Telling you where to go

ELI
Its not like that Its kinda hard
to explain Im guided by faith

SOLARA
I dont know what that word means

BEAT as Eli thinks on how to explain it

ELI
It means you know something even
though you dont know it

Solara thinks about this shakes her head

SOLARA
That doesnt make any sense at all

ELI
It doesnt have to

They walk on
EXT HOUSE - DAY

On the outskirts of a small town that lies in ruins Almost
every building burned or reduced to rubble

Except for one SMALL HOUSE The building is damaged and worn
but in mostly decent condition It stands out among its
surroundings for being the only structure still intact

The windows are BARRED The outer structure fortified with
SHEET METAL and other custom patch-ups The whole plot
surrounded by a CHAIN-LINK FENCE TOPPED WITH RAZOR WIRE

Eli and Solara crouch behind a pile of rubble nearby

SOLARA
I dont get it It looks almost
normal Like nothing ever happened
How can it still be out here

ELI
I dont know
SOLARA
Maybe we should look inside There
might be food

BEAT as Eli considers Then stands and unhooks his shotgun

ELI
Stay behind me

They approach the house cautiously Arrive at the perimeter
fence Theres a gate held in place by a PADLOCK

Eli pulls a pair of BOLT-CUTTERS from his belt and snips the
They

padlock free Swings open the gate with a metallic SQUEAK

They move inside up the garden path Though the soil in the
yard is dead its been carefully raked and tended WEEDS
arranged in thoughtful patterns like real flowers

SOLARA
This is weird

ELI
Yeah

Eli steps forward his foot planting on a CRACKED PAVING
STONE that shifts almost imperceptibly under his feet
Accompanied by a barely audible SOUND He looks down

ELI
Shit

SOLARA
What

A ROPE NOOSE suddenly whips around their feet tightening at
their ankles and YANKING THEM UPSIDE-DOWN INTO THE AIR Eli
drops his shotgun to the ground

They hang there for a moment twisting in the breeze
The front door to the house SWINGS OPEN to reveal

AN ELDERLY COUPLE The womans gray hair tied into a neat
bun The man bald squinting through wire-frame glasses

look like the couple from Grant Woods American Gothic

Instead of a pitchfork the man holds a 12-GAUGE RIOT SHOTGUN
which he keeps trained from the hip on Eli and Solara

They step outside regarding their new visitors carefully
The man seems more suspicious than his wife He drags Elis
shotgun toward him with his foot hands it to his wife

ELDERLY MAN
Who are you

ELI
My name is Eli This is Solara
Were travelers thats all We
dont mean you any harm
ELDERLY MAN
You cut my padlock I saw you
Trying to break into our house

ELI
Im sorry We didnt think anybody
lived here We thought it was
abandoned like all the rest

This seems to annoy the man

ELDERLY MAN
Take a look around you Look at
this yard Does it look abandoned
to you

Clearly hes proud of the work hes done with the pitiful
means at his disposal

ELI
No sir I like what youve done
with the place

ELDERLY MAN
Whats your business here

ELI
No business Were sorry to have
troubled you If youll let us down
well happily be on our way

The wife steps forward shes much warmer less guarded

ELDERLY WOMAN
George look at them Theyre not
robbers or road agents One of
thems just a girl

ELDERLY MAN
Seen that before Oldest trick in
the book

ELDERLY WOMAN
Oh stop Its no trick Let them

down

The woman glares at him The husband reluctantly accedes and
moves to the concealed trap apparatus Releases the rope
eagerly

dropping Eli and Solara to the ground in a heap

The old woman helps them to their feet They shake off the
noose from their ankles

ELDERLY WOMAN

Im so sorry about my husband We
so rarely get visitors these days
hes suspicious of everybody

(BEAT)
Im Martha and this is my husband
George Would you care for some
tea

Eli and Solara exchange a look What the hell is this
INT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Its like something out of the world before The interior is
almost perfectly preserved Chintzy couches A mahogany
table A TV set in the corner Lace curtains Unreal

Eli and Solara sit on the couch feeling self-conscious and
looking entirely out of place in this cozy environment

George sits across from them on the couch scowling at them
inhospitably The shotgun resting across his lap

Martha emerges from the kitchen carrying a tray laden with

tea pot and old china cups Cracked and faded but intact
She places the tray on the coffee table and sits

MARTHA
Im afraid we dont have any cake
or biscuits for the tea They ran
out some time ago

She lifts the tea port and pours into the cups But its not
tea only water Somewhat murky water Eli and Solara stare

at the cups unsure Martha gestures toward them

MARTHA
Please

They raise their cups and take a sip Martha watches

Its clearly a thrill for her to be doing something as
civilized and elegant as serving tea to guests

MARTHA
How do you like it

ELI
Its uh

SOLARA
Its very good

Martha smiles delighted She lifts her own cup to her lips
HER HANDS TREMBLE the cup rattling against the saucer

ELI
Have you always lived here

MARTHA
For almost forty years now This
home is our pride and joy isnt
it George

George just grunts Not interested in conversation

MARTHA
We refused to leave even during
the troubles We said didnt we
George we said if were going to
die anywhere were going to die
right here in our own home

ELI
I dont understand how youve
survived out here this long

MARTHA
Well George is something of a
handyman arent you dear He did
a lot of work on the place making
it safe We may be old but were
resilient Weve had more than a
few whove tried to take this place
from us Havent we George

GEORGE
Yes Yes we have

He stands and moves toward the back door Opens it up and
beckons Eli and Solara to come look

EXT HOUSE - BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS
Eli and Solara stand in the doorway looking out on the
yard
Solara is horrified by what she sees

The entire back yard is a GRAVEYARD Maybe twenty human
graves dug shallow into the earth Some were dug long ago
others look like theyre very recent

SOLARA
Are these graves

MARTHA
Of course It would be uncivilized
not to bury them Were not
barbarians

GEORGE
Plus its good for the soil

MARTHA
Come on back inside I think I
might be able to rustle up some
sandwiches

George and Martha go back inside leaving Eli and Solara
gazing at the little graveyard

ELI
We have to get out of here

SOLARA
They look so sweet I would never
have believed they were killers

ELI
Theyre worse than that

SOLARA
What
ELI
They didnt just kill these people
(BEAT)

They ate them
Solara is stunned

SOLARA
They what
for

ELI
Theres a disease in the outland
Spread by eating human meat It
affects the brain Dementia loss
of motor function Did you notice
the old womans hands shaking
Shes got it Theyve both got it

SOLARA
Oh my God

INT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Eli and Solara re-enter Solara looks at George nervously
Hes still carrying that shotgun

Marthas voice drifts in from the nearby KITCHEN

MARTHA (0S)
I found some meat for those
sandwiches Are you hungry

SOLARA
No Thank you

ELI
We really must be going

GEORGE
So soon

An unnerving glint in his eye Eli moves toward the door

ELI
Yes Im afraid so

As he gets to the door George moves to intercept Hard to
tell if hes blocking his path or moving to open the door

him A tense BEAT
Martha emerges from the kitchen

MARTHA
Are you sure you wont stay

ELI
Yes Thank you again for the tea
Eli stares George down Reluctantly George steps aside Eli
opens the door and escorts Solara outside

EXT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Eli and Solara emerge into the sunlight Walk down the
garden

path And FREEZE IN THEIR TRACKS

THE ARMED VEHICLES ARE COMING Driving toward them out of
the
horizon in a hazy cloud of dust

SOLARA
Oh no its my dad Its his men

ELI
Are you sure

SOLARA
I recognize the cars

ELI
Back inside

Eli bundles Solara back into the house George stands in the
doorway squinting at the approaching convoy

INT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
George follows them back in furious

GEORGE
What did you bring upon us

MARTHA
George Whats wrong

GEORGE
A whole convoy of armed
degenerates thats whats wrong
Coming here for them And they led
them right to us

Martha rushes to the window pulls aside the lace curtain
Outside she sees the armored vehicles SCREECHING TO A HALT

The men spill out from the vehicles and take cover behind
them locking and loading weapons
MARTHA
Oh no they dont

She rushes across the room teeth gritted with
determination

GEORGE
Martha what are you doing

MARTHA
I finally got this house just the
way I want it Im not going to let
anybody tear it apart

She goes to the couch and yanks off the seat cushions
Underneath is a WOODEN LID which she throws open to reveal

A HUGE CACHE OF WEAPONS Automatic rifles Shotguns
Pistols
Grenades And enough ammunition for everything

She pulls out an M-60 MACHINE-GUN slings the strap over her
shoulder and locks in a CHAIN OF BULLETS She looks like a
post-apocalyptic Martha Stewart

SOLARA
Where did you get all this stuff

George pulls out an AK-47 slots in a magazine

GEORGE
Took “em off them who came looking
to take the place from us Built up
quite the stash over the years

He offers a 44 MAGNUM to Solara

GEORGE
You know how to fire a gun

SOLARA
My daddy showed me once

GEORGE
Just like riding a bike

SOLARA
I never rode a bike

George sighs turns instead to Eli

GEORGE
How about you you know how to-

Eli is already reloading his shotgun checking the barrel
Readying the weapon in the practiced manner of an expert

GEORGE
Never mind

EXT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Redridge steps forward raises a BULLHORN

REDRIDGE
We know youre in there Come on
out with your hands up and your
weapons on the deck and nobody
needs to get hurt

SILENCE No sign of activity inside the house

Redridge turns back to his men Their hands trembling They
didnt sign up for this and theyre not ready for it

Redridge turns back to the house Into the bullhorn

REDRIDGE
All right look Im gonna make it
easy on yall Bring out the girl
with the book

INT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Eli is crouched beneath the window George and Martha have
taken up positions at other windows peering out

REDRIDGE (0S)
Thats all we want The girl and
the book The rest of yous can go

SOLARA
What are we going to do

BEAT as Eli thinks
of

ELI
Hand me my pack

EXT HOUSE - DAY

Redridge waits Still no sign of a response His nervous
gunmen exchange worried looks

CARNEGIE GUNMAN 2
They aint comin out They-

Redridge raises his hand to silence him Looks up as an
UPSTAIRS WINDOW slides open

A CLOTH PACKAGE is tossed from the window It lands in the
dirt outside the perimeter fence a few yards from Redridge

Cautiously he approaches The package is wrapped in cloth
and tied up with twine It looks like Elis bible

He picks it up and tugs at the twine untying it Folds away
the cloth wrapping Looks for a moment in puzzlement at the
object at the words written on the front of it

THIS SIDE TO FACE ENEMY
Its a MINIATURE CLAYMORE MINE The small red light on top

the unit ILLUMINATES WITH A BEEP Armed

REDRIDGE
Holy shi

He drops the package in the dirt and races for his life back
toward the vehicles

REDRIDGE
Get down Everybody get down

He dives across the trunk of the Explorer into cover as THE
MINE EXPLODES SHATTERING EVERY WINDOW OF EVERY VEHICLE The
lightweight Mini Cooper takes the main brunt and EXPLODES
cartwheeling through the air a burning wreck

Redridge looks around Three men lie dead already Flaming
wreckage all around him Suddenly its a war zone
return

MACHINE-GUN FIRE ERUPTS FROM THE HOUSE peppering the
vehicles armor The gunmen cower behind cover

REDRIDGE
Damn you return fire

Redridge aims at the house and OPENS FIRE Inspired by his
example the others follow A HAIL OF BULLETS CRISS-CROSS
BACK AND FORTH The houses faded paint facade is shredded

INT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Martha continues firing wildly with the M-60 Screaming at
the top of her lungs loving every minute of it

MARTHA
Come and get it you god-damn sons
of mother-fucking bitches

George and Eli also open fire from their windows
periodically ducking to take cover from incoming fire

Solara sits across the room in the corner sobbing

ELI
Its all right Were going to be
all right Trust me

MORE GUNFIRE splinters the window frame above his head

ELI

You remember what I told you about
faith

She nods

Eli peeks out and FIRES OUT THE WINDOW dropping one of the
enemy gunmen with a crack shot Ducks back down as the

fire impacts around him

ELI
Were going to get out of this
alive Both of us I know

SOLARA
Because God told you

ELI

THE

Because God told me

Amidst all the chaos and gunfire George has been listening
to this exchange

GEORGE
What about us

BEAT

ELI
He didnt mention you

BEAT George chambers a round and RESUMES FIRING
EXT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Redridges men continue the hail of gunfire Six of them

now six more still standing No lessening of fire from
inside the house Theyre losing

Redridge races between the vehicles ducking from gunfire
until he makes it to the back of the Dodge Caravan Pops the
trunk and pulls out a ROCKET-PROPELLED GRENADE LAUNCHER

He sets it on his shoulder rests on the trunk to steady his
aim And FIRES The rocket screams toward its target

through the chain fence and TEARING AN ENTIRE CORNER FROM
HOUSE in a fiery explosion

INT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Filled with smoke The sounds of COUGHING

Dazed George pushes his way through the smoke waving his
arms to clear it A BLOODY GASH on his forehead

GEORGE
Martha Martha

He finds her lying on the tile floor in what remains of the
kitchen Or at least her top half The rest of her is gone

George slumps to his knees with tear-filled eyes Takes his
wife tenderly by the hand for a moment
by

but

Then the anger returns He gets up and turns consumed now

a wild fury Firing with rage over the torn brick wall He
CLIPS ANOTHER GUNMAN IN THE HEAD killing him

George moves back toward the LIVING ROOM firing as he goes
EXT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Redridge moves between the cars again staying behind cover
Georges hail of gunfire has them pinned down

REDRIDGE
We got any more of those RPGs

CARNEGIE GUNMAN 3
That was it

REDRIDGE
Screw this

Redridge jumps into the drivers seat of the minivan turns
the key in the ignition Jams the accelerator down with the
butt of his rifle then shifts the transmission into DRIVE

REDRIDGE
Get clear

The gunmen leap clear as the minivan HURTLES TOWARD THE
HOUSE engine roaring CRASHES THROUGH THE CHAIN FENCE

INT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Eli looks up from cover and see the van coming RIGHT AT HIM
He dives clear as the van CRASHES THROUGH THE WALL INTO THE

LIVING ROOM It SMASHES INTO THE FAR WALL finally coming to
a stop

More dust and debris more coughing Eli tries to get up
winces in pain Puts his hand to his side it comes back WET
WITH BLOOD A bad wound He covers it with his coat stands

and moves through the smoke

ELI
Solara

SOLARA (0S)
Eli

He finds her in the smoke She embraces him
ELI
Are you all right

SOLARA
Im fine

As the smoke clears Solara sees George PINNED AGAINST THE
WALL BY THE MINIVAN His body crushed Dead

SOLARA
Oh God

ELI
Come on Were going out the back
Were running

As he helps her to her feet we hear the sound of MOVEMENT
THROUGH THE RUBBLE

They turn around The gunmen are ENTERING THE HOUSE passing
through the smoking hole left by the minivan

Eli reaches for his sword Met by the sound of MULTIPLE GUNS
COCKING Redridge steps out from among the gunmen Smiles

REDRIDGE
Go ahead and try it holy man You
aint that fast

EXT HOUSE - DAY

Eli and Solara are shoved out of the house at gunpoint and
marched past the torn perimeter fence to the vehicles

Eli has been stripped of his weapons and backpack Redridge
faces him and points a pistol at his head

REDRIDGE
Wheres the book

BEAT Eli doesnt answer Redridge cocks the pistol

REDRIDGE
I aint playing

Redridge stares him down Eli just stares right back
Totally
unflappable Redridge motions to his men
REDRIDGE
Check the pack

The gunman carrying Elis pack opens it up and tips its
contents out onto the ground The ghillie suit battery

some
old canned goods other odds and ends No sign of the book
CARNEGIE GUNMAN 4
It aint here

REDRIDGE
Its gotta be
Redridge holsters his gun and frisks Eli going through his
pockets Finds nothing He opens Elis coat and checks the
inside pockets Digs around deep inside
REDRIDGE
Hello what have we here
And then suddenly he SHRIEKS IN PAIN Yanks his hand out to
reveal ELIS RAT TEETH SUNK DEEP INTO HIS FLESH
Redridge flails around violently trying to get the rat off
him but it wont let go His hand is bleeding badly
REDRIDGE
Fuck Get it off Get it off me
He finally manages to shake it free It hits the floor
dazed
Redridge STOMPS ON IT with his boot reducing it to a bloody
smear in the dirt Eli lowers his head in sadness
Redridge clutches his bloody hand glares at Eli furiously
Pulls his gun again and marches right up to him pressing
the

muzzle tight against his forehead

REDRIDGE
If you dont got the book what
fucking use are you

His finger tightens on the trigger

SOLARA
Wait
She breaks from the gunmen holding her and rushes toward
Redridge Reaches inside her dress and PRODUCES THE BIBLE

SOLARA
Its here Ive got it Please

ELI
Solara

SOLARA
Its just a book Eli No book is
worth giving up your life for

ELI
Youre wrong

Satisfied Redridge takes the book Runs his hand over the
leather cover gazes admiringly at the gold-embossed cross

REDRIDGE
You did good sweetheart Your
daddy would be proud He knew youd
come through for him

Solara looks at Eli guiltily She feels terrible

SOLARA
He said he would hurt my mom If I
didnt help him

REDRIDGE
(SMILING)
Daddys little girl

Solara stands between him and Eli Deadly serious now

SOLARA
I want you to let him go

REDRIDGE

SOLARA
Youve got what you came for You

REDRIDGE

Hes killed a dozen of my men
SOLARA

If you hurt him Im not coming

back with you Youll have to drag

me kicking and screaming

Solara glares at Redridge He sighs He can tell she means
it Its not worth the aggravation He turns back to Eli

REDRIDGE
Take your shit and get out of here

Eli gathers up his stuff into his pack Shoulders it and
to pick up his sword but Redridge puts his boot on it

REDRIDGE
No weapons

Eli still has a half-dozen guns trained on him He turns and
walks away toward the road As he passes Solara

ELI
I told you wed both live Now do
you have faith
A tear runs down Solaras cheek as she watches him walk
Redridge grabs her by the arm and pulls her toward the
vehicles as his men load up and prepare to move out

IN THE REARMOST VEHICLE

Solara sits in the back seat staring out the rear window as
it drives down the road at the tail end of the convoy

She watches as Eli moves away down the road getting smaller
and smaller until he is just a speck on the horizon

She bursts into floods of uncontrollable tears

LATER

Solara in the back seat calmer now The tears dried on her
cheeks She sits staring blankly at the DRIVER in front

And then she LUNGES VIOLENTLY FORWARD Clawing and biting at
the driver who struggles to fight her off His hands come
off the wheel and the car FISHTAILS WILDLY

REDRIDGES VEHICLE
The DRIVER sees something odd in the rear-view mirror

DRIVER
What the hell

Redridge turns to see the car behind VEERING ERRATICALLY

then
SLAMMING ON THE BRAKES stopping in the middle of the road
REDRIDGE
Stop stop
The car screeches to a halt Redridge watches through the
rear window as the drivers side door opens and the driver
is
KICKED OUT ONTO THE ASPHALT
The door closes again the engine revs and the car TURNS
AROUND racing back down the road in the direction it came
REDRIDGE
Shit Turn around
DRIVER
We aint got the gas for it

REDRIDGE
Shes getting away

DRIVER
We got the book And we got barely
enough gas to make it back as it
is We cant go chasin her

The car moves on following the rest of the convoy

EXT HOUSE - DAY

Solara screeches the car to a halt outside the smoking
wreckage of the besieged house She runs from the vehicle to
where ELIS SWORD lies in the dirt and grabs it up

EXT ROAD - DUSK

Solara races down the road in the car pedal to the metal

SOLARA
Come on come on

Eventually she sees him At first just a dot on the

But unmistakably Eli By now shed know him anywhere
Suddenly the engine SPLUTTERS She checks the fuel gauge
needle deep in the red She pounds the wheel in frustration

SOLARA
No No

The car grinds to a halt dead She flings open the door and
leaps out of the vehicle rushing after Eli on foot

ON ELI As always his pace steady and slow The sun
ahead of him as it sets on the horizon Headed always west
Solara is running up behind him a hundred yards back

SOLARA
Eli Eli

He doesnt stop or look back Just keeps on walking
She finally catches up with him breathing hard exhausted

SOLARA
Eli

ELI
Thought youd gone back to town

SOLARA
I cant go back there Eli Im so
sorry
ELI
For what

SOLARA
For what I betrayed you I gave
them the book

ELI
You did what you believed you had
to

SOLARA

Youre not mad at me
BEAT

ELI
I forgive you

She continues walking alongside him Trying to process this
This kind of compassion is totally foreign to her

She holds out the sword offering it to Eli by way of
atonement

SOLARA
Here I thought you might still
need this

Eli seems appreciative that she would think to return it to
him He takes it and slings it over his shoulder

ELI
Thank you

SOLARA
What are you going to do now

ELI
Same as always Keep heading west

SOLARA
Why I mean you dont have the
book any more

ELI
But I still have my faith
They walk on together into the sunset
EXT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA - MONTAGE - DAY

Eli and Solara follow the road through burned-out towns and
retail neighborhoods Gutted and dead like every place

else
But something is different here Things are greener Tufts
of
grass here and there They attract Solaras attention
SOLARA
Whats that
Eli reaches down and runs his hand through the grass
ELI
Its grass It used to grow all
over the place
SOLARA
How come its here
ELI
I dont know Less poison in the
air this near to the ocean maybe
They keep walking Eli groans clutches his side Does his
best to hide his pain from Solara She notices anyway
SOLARA
Whats wrong
ELI
Nothing Just a cramp
EXT FREEWAY - NIGHT
They walk on through the night Eli stops and sniffs the
air
SOLARA

ELI

Do you smell that

SOLARA
Smell what

ELI

around

Salt in the air Were close to the
ocean Were almost there

EXT CALIFORNIA ROAD - DAWN

They keep on along the road A shallow uphill incline They
follow it uphill finally reaching its crest where they

and take in the view before them

THE PACIFIC OCEAN Straddled by the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - the
once-great structure has partially collapsed from decades of
neglect and disrepair The span sags and hangs low over the
ocean the asphalt cracked and ruptured

On the other side of the bay SAN FRANCISCO - or the little
that remains of it The city has been almost TOTALLY
DESTROYED - entire areas reduced to rubble the few

still standing looking on the verge of collapse

Solara looks at it all in horrified awe Eli unperturbed
keeps on moving still clutching his side

ELI
Come on

EXT GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY

Eli and Solara make their way south across the bridge side-
stepping the fractures in the road

EXT SAN FRANCISCO RUINS - DAY

Eli leads Solara through the rubble of what used to be San
Francisco Its like walking through the wreckage of 911s
Ground Zero but a hundred times the scale Horrifying

They pass by the wreckage of a HOTEL nothing but the lobby
still standing A HILTON sign protruding from the rubble

Eli uses his sheathed sword as a walking stick poking
ahead of him for loose rubble underfoot He steps carefully
ELI

Watch your footing Step where I
step
slumped

His

sound

end

EXT SAN FRANCISCO - FINANCIAL DISTRICT - DAY
More buildings are still standing here but theyre nothing
more than great dead monoliths Solara looks up at the

blasted skyscrapers - shes never seen anything like it

The buildings loom over her like giant tombstones It scares
her - like walking through the graveyard of a dead world

SOLARA
This this is the world before

ELI
Whats left of it

They keep walking passing the TOPPLED TRANSAMERICA PYRAMID
EXT SAN FRANCISCO - FISHERMANS WHARF - DAY
Once a bustling oceanside tourist spot now a ghost town
Eli and Solara walk along the litter-strewn street passing
the old RIPLEYS BELIEVE-IT-OR-NOT and WAX MUSEUMS The
celebrity mannequins are still in fair condition but
at their feet are CHARRED HUMAN SKELETONS
Eli is struggling now He looks pale from the blood loss
breathing labored Solara takes him by the arm to help him
EXT SAN FRANCISCO - PIER 39 - DAY
A dead ruined place like everywhere else We hear the
of SEAGULLS nearby - the only sign of life at all
Eli and Solara walk along the pier until they reach its
The original end has long since collapsed into the sea but

RICKETY HAND-MADE ROPE BRIDGE has been affixed to the piers
sheared-off edge

Eli and Solara stand at the piers end looking out to sea

ELI
Do you see that
It

SOLARA
I see it Is that it

ELI
Thats it

Reveal now that the rope-bridge leads out across the bay to
ALCATRAZ ISLAND

Looking much the same as it always has old and dilapidated
The coastal fog shrouding it gives it an ethereal look It
feels almost like a mythic place - the promised land Eli
has sought for so many years

A tattered STARS AND STRIPES still flutters in the breeze
atop the prison lighthouse

EXT BAY ROPE BRIDGE - DAY
Eli and Solara make their way carefully across the bridge

feels highly unstable and sags low over the bay the waters
below close enough to lap around their ankles

EXT ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY

Eli and Solara arrive at the prison gates Securely locked
As they inspect it for a possible way to enter

VOICE (0S)
Who goes there

They look up A GUARD in paramilitary fatigues is stationed
in one of the perimeter towers Training a rifle on them

ALCATRAZ GUARD
Identify yourselves

In the opposite tower ANOTHER GUARD has his rifle trained on
them too Eli looks up raises his hands

ELI
My name is Elijah Stone I have a
message for your boss I need you
to tell him that I have a King
James Bible in my possession

BEAT
inside

ALCATRAZ GUARD
Remain where you are Do not
attempt to move or you will be
fired upon

Keeping the gun trained on them the tower guard uses his
free hand to talk into a WALKIE-TALKIE RADIO We dont hear
the conversation All Eli and Solara can do is wait

The guard puts away his radio and shouts back down

ALCATRAZ GUARD
Be prepared to surrender any
weapons at the gate

BEAT And then the massive front gates SLOWLY OPEN ON
MECHANICAL RUNNERS with the low groan of rusted iron

Eli and Solara look at each other then step gingerly

INT ALCATRAZ - MAIN GATES - CONTINUOUS

As soon as they step inside they are SURROUNDED BY DOZENS OF
HEAVILY-ARMED SOLDIERS Not US military more like a semi-
official militia But every bit as deadly

Eli and Solara raise their hands A pair of SOLDIERS take
Elis pack and sword pat them both down for other weapons

SOLDIER
Theyre clean

The soldiers before them part - to reveal a THIN BALDING

Solara looks at Eli puzzled Lombardi finds it hard to
contain his excitement

LOMBARDI
My goodness I cant tell you how

LOMBARDI (contd)
Ill give you the nickel tour and

He leads them across the courtyard into the prison

buildings
EXT DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY
Redridges remaining vehicles drive back into town and come
to a halt outside the theater Redridge emerges from his
car

carrying the bible Walks up to the Palladium and enters
INT ALCATRAZ - CELL BLOCK - DAY

What was once a cell block is now an IMMENSE LIBRARY
Stacked
floor to ceiling with books Lombardi shows Eli and Solara
around Behind them a pair of ARMED GUARDS follow closely

LOMBARDI
Yes weve been doing this for some
time now Collected over thirty
thousand volumes from generous
donors all across the nation We
even have a printing press that we
hope to have operational soon

Solara is stunned as she surveys the endless stacks of
books
Shes never seen anything like it

SOLARA
You turned the whole prison into a
library

LOMBARDI

Well not exactly Were more like
a storage facility Were holding
these books here in trust if you
like When society gets back on its
feet and no longer needs us to
preserve these volumes theyll be
here waiting

(BEAT)
I must ask you how did you hear
about us Weve been doing
everything we can to get the word
out but we always like to know
where our benefactors come from

ELI
I was sent here by God

Lombardi raises a quizzical eyebrow

LOMBARDI

Is that right Well its good to
know were getting such high-
profile referrals these days

(BEAT)
I must say I am so excited that we
finally have a King James You
know we have a Talmud here we
have two Korans we even have that
Scientology book But never a
Christian bible until now I
honestly believed it was the one
book Id never see again after
what happened

BEAT Lombardi appears sad for a moment

LOMBARDI
May I ask what condition its in

ELI
Its a little beat-up But itll do
the job

LOMBARDI
Well then What say we take a look
at it

Lombardi looks at Eli with anticipation So does Solara
interested to know where this is going to go next

Eli winces in pain puts his hand to his side

ELI
Is there someplace we could sit

LOMBARDI
Of course Right this way

INT PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIES BOX
Redridge appears Carnegie looks at him eagerly

CARNEGIE
Did you get it

Redridge holds the bible up proudly Carnegie beams

CARNEGIE
Show me

Redridge hands it over Carnegie sits back in his chair
running his hand lovingly over the battered leather cover

CARNEGIE
The new world begins here

He opens the book and looks inside
guards

BEAT And then he looks up at Redridge confused

CARNEGIE
What the fuck is this

INT ALCATRAZ - CAFETERIA - DAY

Eli Solara and Lombardi sit at one of the long lunch-room
tables The two armed guards keep watch nearby

ELI
Do you have something you can write
with

LOMBARDI

Mmm Oh yes of course

He pulls a pen from his pocket motions to one of the

LOMBARDI
Could you please bring us some
writing paper

The guard nods and moves toward the door As he does so

ELI
Bring a lot of it

INT PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIES BOX

Carnegie looks at the open bible jaw hanging loose his
complexion ashen Like hes just been slapped in the face

REDRIDGE
What What is it

INT ALCATRAZ - CAFETERIA - DAY

The guard brings a THICK SHEAF OF WRITING PAPER to the
cafeteria table sets it down by Lombardi

ELI
Are you ready

LOMBARDI
What exactly am I writing

ELI
Pay close attention and write down
every word exactly as I say it

Eli removes his goggles Solara cant believe

His eyes are pale milky-white dead TOTALLY

ELI
The First Book of Moses called
Genesis Chapter one verse one In
the beginning God created the
heavens and the earth Verse two
The earth was without form and
void and darkness was on the face
of the deep And the spirit of God
was hovering over the face of the
waters Verse three And God said
Let there be light and there was
light

Lombardi hurriedly writes down every word

INT PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIES BOX

Carnegie sits at his desk

open on the desk before him

A BRAILLE BIBLE

Claudia is ushered in by a guard

He rushes

CLAUDIA
Whats wrong

what she sees

BLIND

still in shock Elis bible sits

forward and thrusts the bible into her hands

CARNEGIE
You told me once that you know how
to read this This blind language

CLAUDIA
Well a long time ago when I was a
little girl

CARNEGIE
Youre going to read it for me
Every word And Im going to write
it down Start at the beginning

As Carnegie hunts on his desk for a paper and pen Claudia
opens the book and trails her fingertips across the raised
lettering

For a moment there is a glimmer of recognition a faint
smile but then it fades as Carnegie turns back to her

eagerly clutching the writing materials

CLAUDIA
Im sorry Its been so long I
dont remember I dont remember
any of it

Carnegie is aghast BEAT as the anger swells within him
threatening to explode

CARNEGIE
God fucking dammit

He swipes violently at the bible knocking it out of

Claudias hands He grabs it up and tries to rip it in two

but its too thick to tear Red-faced with rage he tosses
it

out over the box balcony It lands somewhere in the dark
auditorium below between the rows of gutted theater seats

As he paces angrily back past Claudia

CLAUDIA
Bill is there something-

CARNEGIE
Just go Just get out of my sight

He slumps in his chair exhausted and furious Claudia sadly
turns and leaves him alone with his thoughts

INT ALCATRAZ - CAFETERIA - NIGHT

Some considerable time later Great stacks of paper have
been
filled with Lombardis handwriting

Lombardis pen races across the paper struggling to keep up
with Elis recitation

Solara is curled up on a nearby bench asleep Elis coat
covering her to keep her warm

Eli clutches his wound painfully as he continues to recite
He looks paler now than ever Close to death
and

careful

ELI (V0O)
Dear Lord thank you for giving me
the strength and the conviction to
complete the task you entrusted to
me Thank you for guiding me
straight and true through the many
obstacles in my path

ELI (VO) (contd)
And for keeping me resolute when
all around seemed lost
EXT ALCATRAZ - EXERCISE YARD - PRE-DAWN
The prison yard shrouded in the dim light just before dawn

Solara crosses the yard She looks more mature somehow
Determined and strong She carries with her ELIS SWORD -

something else tucked under her arm
ELI (V0O)
Thank you for your protection and
for your many signs along the way

She stops in a nondescript corner of the yard

At her feet is a SHALLOW MOUND OF DIRT At the head of the
mound a SIMPLE TOMBSTONE

She kneels and places a SINGLE FLOWER on the grave
INT PALLADIUM - CARNEGIES BEDROOM - NIGHT
Lit only by the pale moonlight barely enough to see by

Carnegie sleeps soundly in bed Next to him lies Claudia
wide awake She checks that Carnegie is sound asleep

not to wake him before she creeps out of bed and exits
INT PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

Claudia is on her hands and knees in the darkness searching
blindly in the aisles and beneath the theater seats

She finds Elis bible in some litter strewn on the floor
barely

up

LOMBARDI

ELI (V0O)
Thank you for the good that I have
done For whatever light you were
able to shine into the darkness of
this world through me

Sitting in the darkness Claudia opens the book and runs her
fingers across the braille reading And though we can

see in the dim light we see the smile on her face The joy
EXT ALCATRAZ - EXERCISE YARD - DAWN

As Solara kneels by the grave we see now that she wears
Elis SAINT CHRISTOPHER PENDANT around her neck

The tombstone reads

HERE LIES ELIJAH STONE
DIED AUGUST 21 2048
FAITHFUL SERVANT TO THE LORD
AND FRIEND TO SOLARA

She unsheathes Elis sword plants it in the ground before
his grave Takes the BOOK from under her arm and opens it

Its a NEW BIBLE Crudely typeset from Lombardis original
transcription and printed on the prison press

She opens it up and begins to read a passage from the bible
over Elis grave We dont hear what she says

As Solara finishes her reading and closes the bible

appears behind her

LOMBARDI
You know you dont have to leave
Youre welcome to stay here with
us Youll be safe

SOLARA
Thanks

She stands pulling Elis sword from the earth

SOLARA
But I gotta do what I gotta do
LOMBARDI
Where will you go

BEAT Solara looks at the sword her fingers playing across
its hilt The blade glimmers in the light of the rising sun

There is a determined purposeful look in her eye

SOLARA
Home

EXT ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAWN
The sun rises through the fog on the horizon

The great iron gates grind open Solara emerges from inside
the prison steps out onto the island rock

She is dressed in a flak jacket combat pants and boots
Elis old pack across her back Hair tied in a neat pony
tail Atop that Elis ragged fur hat

ELI (V0O)
Thank you for the friend I made

In her hand she clutches a copy of the newly-printed bible
Elis sword slung over her shoulder

ELI (V0O)
Please watch over her as you
watched over me

MONTAGE as Solara walks back along Fishermans Wharf
through the San Francisco rubble across the Golden Gate
bridge

ELI (V0O)
Thank you for allowing me finally
to rest Im so very tired The

and finally back onto a desolate road leading off into

desert wasteland She looks up and down the road then turns
and heads toward the sun on the horizon Headed east

ELI (V0O)
I have fought the good fight I
have finished the race

As she walks away into the sun her lonely silhouette on the
road reminds us of Eli as we saw him so many times before

ELI (V0O)
I have kept the faith

She grows smaller and smaller as she walks into the
until she consumed by the rising sun and we

FADE OUT
