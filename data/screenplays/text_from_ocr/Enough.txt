NOTE ON TITLES

GRAPHIC TITLES pop up throughout Some are chapter titles
others more like the explanatory arrows found in cartoons
Sometimes the words present themselves in normal fashion At
other times theyre loosely spaced or sharply angled or
individual words flash up one after another ie titles
ought to be wilder and less uniform than I suggest on the

page
HEY

sloppy white waitress uniform gorgeous again dishes

SLIM
Enjoy your grub huh
Shes seven feet away when she hears

OUR HERO

HEY -
Sheturns back toward him -
He smiles offers the rose

OUR HERO

You

She smiles back-their eyes meet a sudden utterly magical

moment This is also the moment tonote OUR HERO should be

played by a famous actor doing a cameo Because at this

instant the scene changes

The man (MITCH) in the booth behind Our Hero - a man we
havent

noticed because all weve seen is the back of his head -
turns

and looks at Slim Stands Looks down at Our Hero

MITCH
How much did you settle on

OUR HERO
Excuse me
Slim frowns steps closer so she can overhear

MITCH
The bet How much is it
Our Hero has a completely blank look on his face -

MITCH (CONT)
You and your friend Yesterday
Was it 200 or 500 or -
which

things

path

in

SLIM

(TO MITCH)
Whatre you -

MITCH
He bet his friend he could get in
your pants in less than twelve
hours starting noon today
Our Hero rises to his feet and pushes Mitch in the chest

looks like a stupid move since Mitch is bigger -

OUR HERO
Is this your business
(right in Mitchs face)
What are you the morals police
He pushes again and Mitchs hand shoots out like a snake
striking Grabs him by the collar Lifts him A frozen
moment more violence just a breath away and a sense of

about to spin out of control Our Heros eyes are popping
he tries to hide his fear

OUR HERO
Take it easy Mman She and
I were just having some fun -

SLIM
(to our Hero)
Was it two hundred or five

(VERY CALM)
I want to know what Im worth
Our Hero gestures to Mitch would you mind putting me down
Mitch reluctantly obliges
Our Hero does his best to recollect his dignity Looks at
Slim Drops a ten on the table and smirks

OUR HERO

The bet was two but now that I

know you Way too high

A pained look flashes across Slims face -

Our Hero starts toward the door but Mitch steps in his

Speaks quietly but with authority theres a physical power
his words Since hes protecting Slim the power is

COMFORTING
MITCH
Dont come back here buddy Ever
Our Hero nods nervously
Mitch steps back 3 inches just far enough to let our Hero
leave Which he does with considerable relief
Slims leaning vs the counter shaken tears in her eyes -
Mitch tugs his baseball cap mutters as he heads for the

door
MITCH
Sorry to get in your business
SLIM
No Hey Thank you
He nods keeps going
SLIM (CONT )
(blurts out grateful)
I I cant believe you actually
said something
MITCH
(turns shrugs)
If Id kept my mouth shut Ida
felt bad later
Good luck huh
She nods
He ambles out the door A touch of the cowboy in him
She shakes her head looks at Ginny
Ginny gestures as if to say well
At first Slim doesnt get it
Ginny gestures more urgently Come on Whatre you waiting
for She looks toward the door -
Slim follows her look PUSH IN ON SLIMS FACE as she tries
to

work up the courage

BRIDE AND

EXT OLD PASADENA ESTATE NIGHT

FLASHES
Wedding photos Mitch has lots of (surprisingly upper

family Slim has a few friends The more photos FLASH the
more pronounced (and sad) the contrast FLY RIGHT INTO
Bacchanalian DANCING French Champagne has flowed shoes and
inhibitions were abandoned hours ago THE CAMERA weaves
through the DANCERS to find

Slim and Mitch dancing close never quite touching every

intense physical like subtle public sex Their eyes are
locked she runs her veil down his body his hand lightly
touches her ass they slow down and stand lips a millimeter
apart but not quite kissing the sexual tension building
We see how crazy they are about each other how completely
physically involved - and how much fun they have

Watching them is Phil with Mitchs parents MRS TYLER (58
confident at ease with her power and family money and
likeable despite monstrous flaws) and MR TYLER (someone

Tyler married in a moment of cupidity)
MRS TYLER

Mitch was kind of evasive Is her
father dead too

PHIL
Dead to her He left when she was
two
MRS TYLER

Oh Well Im happy to pay for the
WEDDING -

MR TYLER
Yes were very happy -

MRS TYLER
(ignoring Mr T)
Its a way to build bridges Not
that you can (repair all the
damage) When theres such a vast
body of water

PHIL
You dont get along with your son
She gives him a look Shes both offended by and
appreciative
of his bluntness Looks out at Mitch

MRS TYLER
Hes like my father Which means I
guess that hell do very well

PHIL
Hes done well to get Miss Slim

MRS TYLER
Yes he has hasnt he Hes married
down but hes gotten value
As Phil reacts he notices his wife SALIMA has joined

him
With her are two kids (5 and 2)
Salimas looking out at the floor not at Slim but at Ginny
and her dance partner We see a thought cross her mind She
bends down and whispers conspiratorially to the kids
They whoop their response run out to Ginny (who looks quite
uncomfortable in her Maid-of-Honor dress)
FIVE YEAR OLD SON
Mom Mom Mom Can we spend the
night at Phil and Salimas house
Ginny looks over winks at Salima and kisses her kids
GINNY
Dont eat at their ice cream huh
They squeal with pleasure and run off
Ginny turns back resumes dancing with JOE (24 handsome in
a

casual way a good guy)
GINNY
So this was during college or after

JOE
During

GINNY
What was wrong with you
(off his puzzled look)
I mean-whyd you and Slim break
up

JOE
Oh Well Im terrible in bed
(lets this hang for a moment
for shock value then)
Plus I dont know we just sort
of evolved into being friends

GINNY
Evolution You were going the
wrong direction bud

JOE
Thats kinda what 1 thought but I
guess I was so totally pathetic -

GINNY
Why am I not believing this

(INTRIGUED)
Can I take you home right now

JOE
If youve got a sense of humor

GINNY
My kids are out for the night and

JOE
Another thing I live in Chicago
women always want the possibility of
LONG-TERM -

GINNY
I didnt propose huh
I just want to have
(looks at him)
a brief and completely unsatisfying
sexual encounter

JOE
Hey Im your guy
She pulls him into a kiss andwell hes not a bad

kisser
We glide from them to Slim and Mitch hardly moving
Suddenly
tender and insecure and almost comic she looks at him
SLIM
You sureyou love me
MITCH
Uh-huh

SLIM
For ever and ever
He stops dancing Senses the real issue beneath her
questions

MITCH
Youre safe with me Slim Youre
safe and its okay to be happy
We deserve it
They kiss Others stop to watch how cute Phil comes over
waits When they break

PHIL
Im sorry I gotta get up five
oclock to buy green beans
He slips an envelope into Mitchs hand

PHIL
top

In my country its tradition to
give money to groom You dont
need it but

Slim shakes her head touched as

MITCH
Thats very sweet -

SLIM

(HUGGING PHIL)
Thanks for giving me away okay
Youre the best substitute Dad a girl
could possibly have

PHIL
No substitute I am real thing
She kisses him and he goes They look after him

MITCH
He really loves you
She nods not quite picking up how odd his statement is of
course he loves her she nicked him to give her away
Mitch turns her toward him and slips his hands inside the

of her dress (so the back of his hands touch her breasts is
this going too far) He pulls her to him whispers

MITCH
You gonna give me babies

SLIM
Oh yeah

MITCH
How soon

SLIM

How soon can we get out of here
He hoists her into his arms and carries her off the floor
Applause from the GUESTS Its a grand romantic gesture You
have to wonder if Mitch is just a little too good to be

true

Six weeks later Shes happily putting away groceries
Whistling to herself What we can see of the house feels

the furnishings are simple casual friendly

Shes putting a bottle of oil up on a shelf but it never
quite gets there Her face changes Somethings happened
The hand holding the oil lowers the oil bottle slips

her fingers and smashes on the floor

Oil spreading across the floor

She stares at it

Projects everywhere Models photos charts and timelines

In the center of this activity Mitch moves from one locus

energy to the next answering questions making suggestions
Gradually we perceive something motion slower than the rest

smothering her with kisses
The Nurse brings the baby in starts to give her to Slim -

MITCH
Can I hold her
The Nurse looks at Slim who nods and gives Mitch the
baby

He kisses her head dances with her

Slim looks adoringly at father and daughter the sight is

almost unbelievably sweet

His cell phone rings He keeps dancing ignoring it

After one ring it stops

Hes kissing the babys head over and over just like he
kissed

Slim and staring into the infants eyes -

MITCH
She looks just like my baby
pictures
His cell phone rings again As if the previous call had been

Slim looks at him as the phone keeps ringing

With some difficulty juggling the baby he turns the phone
off

But he doesnt look at Slim

SLIM

She stares at him
He stares at the baby

Keeps laughing which really gets Gracie going Mitch looks
on tries to join in but its forced-and besides that
theyre not even looking at him not inviting his laughter
its all between the mother and child
So he stops trying Just watches them And before his eyes
they become - for an instant - strangers As this reaction
and the subtle hostility it engenders flicker across his

Slim looks up at him -

For one long moment they both seem to acknowledge the gulf
between them

Then Gracie says something Slim turns back toward her the

Scans the room as if shes never seen it before

Reaches down to pick it up but instead of the toy moving

her body moves down She slumps to the floor Sits Stares

WIDER ANGLE MINUTES LATER
Slim sitting on the floor Frozen Head bowed

Mitch comes out dressed sees her

MITCH
Hey

He approaches her Some instinct keeps him from speaking He
sees shes holding his phone the silly toy

SLIM

Theyre hugging Begin TIGHT on them At first it seems like

this is the same embrace shot from a different angle Then
we

see were in the kitchen his briefcase is at his side

clothes are different

We watch Slims expression slowly change From pleasure To
confusion Pain Outrage She whispers

SLIM

MITCH

SLIM
Her perfume Darcelle or whoever

MITCH
SLIM -

SLIM
(intense sad)
How many Mitch How many are there
How many have there been

MITCH
What does it matter
A stunning statement Even more stunning because of the
casual
way he says it

MITCH (CONT)

ID I mean whatre you saying here that
I dont deserve to get laid Please
Im aman Slim With the

pregnancies Gracie you dont have
time and energy like you used to and
I understand that I really do Men
and women have different needs and

take care of it and maybe thats
better for everybody

SLIM
Including you
He contemplates his answerand shrugs

SLIM
No No No

MITCH
Calm down Slim -
Wild violently invading his space and assaulting his
authority
screaming at him her face just inches from his

I

SLIM
I cant do this anymore I cant
Just take it and take it and take
it Im not strong enough I dont
know who would be I love you okay
I love you and Im your wife and you
cant do this You understand me
No more No more
With the same speed he attacked Our Hero at the diner
Mitchs hand shoots out like a snake striking Slaps her
A warning stop it and stop it now
Her face shock Confusion Outrage She raises her hand to
her cheek Touches her skin where his fist landed
He reads her expression and is almost amused

MITCH
What I cant hit you

SLIM
(low strong)
No You cant
He hits her again this time with a closed fist
yeah

Knocking her to the ground
Stands over her like a boxer
Sees rase flare across her face -

MITCH
You want to fight Im a mom
honey its no contest

Shes silent but we see (very small) her reaction

MITCH CONT

You have to understand Slim

I thought you did make the money

here so I set the rules right

Its my rules

He waits for her response but again shes silent

MITCH
You with me

SLIM
Its your rules

MITCH
Yeah
She keeps her voice meek so as not to offend

SLIM
And if I dont like the rules

MITCH
If you dont like them
She nods cautiously

MITCH CONT

Come on Life isnt onl stuff we

today is a bad day

Tomorrow may be great

SLIM
Tomorrow may be great

fq

MITCH

Oh

SLIM
Tomorrow will be great (Without

He appears to miss her inference

MITCH
Yeah Today is the price you pay
for having such a good life
She stares at him

MITCH

She says nothing

MITCH CONT

This is gonna be better dont you

think

She just cannot process the absurdity of this statement

MITCH CONT

MITCH (CONT)
-Ill understand I really will

(ALMOST TENDER)
But theres one thing you cant

Slim stares at him He adds calmly

MITCH (CONT)

Slim shakes her head

Mrs Tyler is clearly disappointed but quickly covers it

MRS TYLER

Well then you and I will have a

girls luncheon and gossip about

Shes about to hurtle into the gossip when Slim turns her

and Mrs Tyler sees (and we see for the first time) the
of Mitchs brutality a nasty bruise on Slims cheek

Mrs Tylers face falls as she realizes what this means
Underneath it all shes a warm person she hugs Slim
MRS TYLER
Oh baby Oh baby Im so sorry

stays sympathetic not at all accusatory

Shes silent terrified Glances over her shoulder -

No one there

She keeps walking The eerie sense of a house thats awake
rather than asleep The almost imperceptible but anxiety-
provoking SWOOSH of her footsteps EXTEND the suspense as
long as we possibly can

She reaches the front door
Waits to make sure all is quiet

It is

She turns looks back down the hall

Empty

Reaches toward the doorknob hand closer closer she
at

Phil nods skeptically and Ginny herself doesnt seem so

They look at the house-and wait and wait We want to
scream GO IN GO SAVE HER

Suddenly something Subtle Was that A SOUND from inside
They go on alert step forward listen more closely
But hear nothing unusual

Phil looks at Ginny shrugs -
Ginny shrugs back -
FLASH OF LIGHT then darkness The signal
They run toward the house -
SCREAM Slim Intense horrible spit of sound replaced by an
even more horrible silence Deadly silence CLOSE ON GINNY

they run as if weve lost Slim and Ginnysour new
protagonist As we near the house we realize its not

Sound of a beating On Ginnys horrified reaction -
Baseball bat Phil smashes a window

INSTRUCTOR
After he misses what do you do
She answers him with an intense look
He nods and moves after her Slow strong powerful

She backs up Her movements simple graceful economical but
athletic they remind us of the easy way she moved around

restaurant in the first scene

Scattered over the mat are old-fashioned plastic SANTAS that
kids use as punching bags He backs her toward one

then another As she nears them she slides deftly to the
side like she has eyes in the back of her head

He maneuvers her toward a desk-her back to it

Rushes at her -

For a moment she seems trapped -

But as he reaches her she slips to her left tosses him

the desk and onto the mat
She moves quickly to an attacking position standing over

He pats the mat beside him
She sits
He makes a motion and she closes her eyes

INSTRUCTOR
One last thing The hardest lesson
we cant control the universe
She listens

INSTRUCTOR (CONT )
The unexpected may happen
He slides his hand over the mat an order She lies down

Suddenly his maid enters youre
distracted for an instant and
he hits you

SLIM
Thats not possible -

INSTRUCTOR 4

but it will only go so far

SLIM (CONT )

For the sake of this exercise he

hits me

Hes standing over her She looks completely vulnerable

VERY TIGHT ON HER AS

She nods almost imperceptibly

INSTRUCTOR (CONT )

Hes standing over you he thinks
hes won-and as sure as hes a
coward hell try to kick you

SLIM

(SOFTLY)
Yes

INSTRUCTOR
And because you know what hell do

sense her confidence and serenity returning
He draws his foot back as if to kick her

Cocks his head Listens

The SILENCE seems to have texture He gets up

We glimpse a beautiful brick warehouse converted inside

an open loft-like space filled with birdseye maple metal
beams etc Modern glistening expensive

He walks around the place in the dark

In his boxer shorts and t-shirt He looks vulnerable
SLIMS POV From one corner Observing him She has become
the stalker

He decides everythings okay and goes back to the semi
partitioned sleeping area

He gets back into bed - next to a YOUNG BLOND WOMAN 22

she scribbles the number quickly handsit to him -

MITCH

ON SLIM His words echo his threats when he was trying to
strangle her in her hallway

MITCH (CONT)

Slims jaw tightens

When we come back to Mitch hes dressed and packing his
briefcase

MITCH (CONT)
Yeah I want her to meet you
Well call when we get in

(FAKE TENDER )

He hangs up takes a sip of coffee

HIGH ANGLE SHOT looking down on Mitch as he heads out the
door

Slim waits in the rafters until the alarm system beeps its

armed

She climbs down walks into the kitchen

Notices his Mr Coffee machine is still on
Hesitates turns it off

Opens the fridge to find something to eat -

The alarm beeps again

Slim drops silently to the floor

SOUND of the KEY IN THE LOCK -

Slim scuttles away as we hear

FRONT DOOR OPENING FOOTSTEPS coming toward her
She slips around the edge of the counter just as

Mitch enters the kitchen He goes to the Mr Coffee Looks

at it Frowns Didnt he leave it on

Slim in the foreground crouched down Mitch 15 feet away
He

looks around Is something wrong Is someone here

Slim frozen trying not to breath

Mitch listening Wondering should he search the place

She looks for a place to hide -

He looks at his watch Hes late

He walks right toward Slim curls around the counter -

But shes not there any longer

He heads for the front door -

Goes out HOLD ON the hall where she was where he walked

EMPTY The alarm beeps again as he resets it

One silent beat then Slim rises in the kitchen (She dida

360)

She sighs Pours herself some coffee replaces the liquid
with

water Auto-dials her cell phone

She hangs up

Retrieves her duffle bag from its hiding place and pulls out
tools equipment etc Picks up a screwdriver and starts
searching the apartment checking the phone line following

to the place where it enters the apartment
MONTAGE INTERCUT WITH FLASHES of Slim a face a running tab
on her emotions Intensity focus determination fear

as the sequence builds concern about what she doing

MONTAGE IMAGES
She disconnects the phone line
Finds the electrical box opens it finds the main switch
Removes all the knives from the kitchen hides them
Walks the apartment-familiarizing herself with every inch of
it-occasionally she moves a piece of furniture slightly

realize shes assessing fighting spaces angles

She looks from one piece of furniture to another back and
forth gauging the distance between them

She eats a snack from his refrigerator

I
Looks out the back (bedroom) window and sees the water of

J
San Pedro harbor below her
Uses a metal detector to search the apartment
in a drawer of the night table beside his bed she finds a
pistol Removes it There are papers in the same drawer
notes or something She throws these in the trash
She takes out three letters As the CAMERA sweeps over one

them we hear her voice

SLIM (V0)

thanks for letting me come talk
about Gracie And Im glad youre
willing to admit your temper and -
find

out

she

earlier

lets not mince words - the physical
abuse you subjected me to
And glances at SECOND LETTER

SLIM (V0)

Perhaps with your new attitude

e can really work something out

er your last letter Ill see you

he evening of

he puts the letters in the drawer where the pistol was
heyre not in envelopes theyre loose open

he picks up the metal detector resumes her search

he machine beeps insistently around his desk She cant

HNHAnNt ws

anything Finally she discovers a false bottom on one of the
drawers a second gun is in there

With the gun are papers reports from private detectives
looking for her an assessment of his custody rights

She hides the guns in the bottom of the laundry hamper
Finds a photo of herself with Mitch and Gracie Rips it up
Puts the metal detector back in the duffle

Changes into sweatshirt and sweatpants

Takes the distinctive red bag (from the electronics store)

of the duffle Theres a machine inside She plugs it in
tucks it behind the couch
Puts her cell phone beside it

She makes one last check every wall surface every drawer
Barefoot she begins to glide around the space Backing up
Moving with ease and grace sliding deftly to the side as

approaches a couch desk chair Shes building on her

reconnaissance learning where the furniture is and how to
navigate around it

DISSOLVE TO

LATER MAGIC HOUR

Light fading toward darkness Shes still moving backward
only now her sliding is smooth graceful almost a dance
As if hearing a distant signal she slows to a stop
an

No

For a long moment she stands perfectly still Poised Like

animal in the forest
Theres a chair facing the front door She glances at it

She walks behind the couch turns off the machine picks up
cell phone and auto-dials

GINNYS VOICE
Hey

GINNYS VOICE (CONT )

GINNYS VOICE
Oh You have a divine animal right
to protect your own life and the
life of your offspring

She hangs up turns the machine back on and stashes her cell
phone
With simple ease she lowers herself onto the chair Facing
the door Waiting in the fading light

DISSOLVE TO
darkness

EXT STREET NIGHT

Mitch walks down the street
Up the steps punches in his alarm code

INT MITCHS PLACE NIGHT

Mitch enters closes and locks the door

Turns on the light

He walks back to the rear of the space hangs up his coat
Goes into the bedroom area takes off his jacket

The lights go out

Mitch freezes shadow on shadow a silhouette in the

He looks out the window sees

The neighboring buildings still have light and power
He cocks his head listening

Silence

Walks to the door of the bedroom area Waits

Take two more steps -

SLIMS VOICE

He nods slowly

MITCH
Yeah (I thought so)

He moves quietly to the bed to the night table where Slim
found the pistol Covers this by talking

MITCH CONT
This morning too

SLIMS VOICE
You always did forget to turn off
the coffee
He rummages in the drawer We hear the RUSTLE of the letters
Slim put there He fails to find the gun Gives up trying to
be quiet tosses papers onto the floor -

SLIMS VOICE CONT

His hand leaves the drawer

He thinks
Picks up the phone listens Dead
Looks around cant see her

Goes back to the chair where he hung his sports coat and
fishes

He punches 911 and pressed SEND

The dial goes dark for two seconds then blinks back on
He stares at it

Tries again 911 SEND

Again it goes dead

SLIMS VOICE
ts a machine Knocks out cell
phones
He throws the cell phone onto the bed
Walks out of the bedroom area
Looks around the vast space
Spooky Slanting light and dense shadow
He doesnt see her

Walks toward his desk

SLIMS VOICE
I found that gun too
He stops Doesnt know where to go or what to do

SLIMS VOICE
Scared

MITCH

Silence is her answer

MITCH (CONT)
Youre sayin this is man to man

SLIMS VOICE
Woman Mitch

MITCH
Thats what I meant man against
woman - you sure thats fair
The lights go back on
Slowly Slim comes out from hiding

SLIM
Fair to whom
As he realizes her meaning she moves into the open area
between two couches
She has no weapon
in

at

Shes barefoot in her sweats feet spread for balance
just slightly raised Compared to him shes tiny
He moves toward her

SLIM
This is what you wanted right
What you were going to San Francisco
for the chance to get me alone

He lunges for her she slides to the side and he misses

He begins to stalk her

arms

And as he stalks she moves backward slowly and gracefully

the way she was practicing

MITCH
I dont understand Slim
How does this work for you

She ignores his words Watches his eyes and his chest Wants

to know where hes going to attack

MITCH (CONT)

I mean this is carefully thought

out right

She does not respond

He throws three punches None of them hits her
Hes unfazed keeps stalking

MITCH (CONT)

But say you succeed - beat me up

or whatever Youre not going to

murder me (CONT)

Her expression remains neutral focused
He takes this to be agreement

MITCH (CONT)
So all youve done is further
piss me off

SLIM
Self defense is not murder

This stops him cold He lowers his hands a moment Stares
jumps

nose

scary

her trying to assimilate this new information

MITCH
You dont have the guts
She just looks at him
He blinks worried for an instant Covers it with a smile

MITCH
Its not self-defense when you
break in here and attack me

SLIM

So far youre attacking me

He lunges almost hits her rushes in -

She has to leap sideways with great speed and dexterity

over the couch to avoid being hit

He also jumps over the couch but his balance isnt as good
and shes waiting for him as he stumbles -

With perfect balance and full force she slugs him in the

He goes down Stays there For the first time it occurs to
him this might not be easy
He climbs to his feet feels his nose blood

SLIM
You see Im just defending myself
He resumes stalking her Only hes angry now and its

MITCH
If you fail you can count on this
youll never see Gracie again
She reacts -
He sees it rushes her -
Punching as he goes From the standpoint of pure physics he
makes a terrifying force Until
She steps back grabs his arm whips him vs the brick wall

He hits it bounces off
Cut on his forehead blood streaming down his face
He stares at her breathing hard trying to put it
together

MITCH
You really (think) you think youll
ill me and get away with itl

SLIM

I told you Self-defense I came
here as arranged in our letters to
talk about Gracie -

MITCH
Letters There are no -

SLIM
n the drawer where your pistol was
You just left prints all over them
He stares at her stunned in every way Touches his

forehead
feels the blood

SLIM
You attacked me I fought back And
of course if you never touch me

(SWEET SMILE)

Ill have to give myself bruises

He goes berserk Leaps at her covering ground quickly with

his long stride swinging his massive arms This is the most

terrifying form of combat a huge person attacking a tiny
one

If he should hit her even once a glancing blow she will go

down she will break it will be over

IIt

But he misses and misses again Sometimes his punches are

wild almost comical Others come so close we hear-the wind

feel their power feel his sweat on her

CONTINUE this terrifying choreographed dance with
destruction

for as long as it will hold At every instant we fear for
her
Ali

married

ashtray

and

bones and her life Sometimes she leans back like Muhammad
to barely slip a punch and we see terror on her face

to determination She knows the score and the odds
Finally in frustration at so many misses he grabs an

hurlsit at her -

it flies over her head -

He punches again and again wildly

She remains untouched

He stops With all the blood he looks like a wild animal
He makes a great effort to pull himself together

MITCH
This doesnt bother me Slim
I dont care how long it takes
We both know Ionly have to hit
you once Once and its over
She laughs at him
This is the last thing he expected and the last thing he can
stand He rushes at her again fast -
She starts left -
He blocks her way -
She starts right -
Again hes blocking her -
She lunges to the left through a narrow space -
He punches grazing her hair punches again just missing

a third time We feel the awesome power behind these blows
Shes in the clear again Smiles casually Clearly part of
her strategy is to keep him angry

SLIM
Im confused Mitchy Arent you a
man

(QUOTING HIM)
I thought it was no contest
I mean cant you hit me even once
He grabs a lamp yanks out the cord wields it like a club
SLIM (CONT )

(AMUSED)
A weapon
He smashes the lamp down just missing her head -

SLIM (CONT )
Its a martial-arts cliche honey
A weapon throws you off balance -

SWISH -
SWIPE -

SLAM -
He misses her three times the last time smashing the lamp
into
the wall so hard that the impact hurts his hand He yelps -

SLIM (CONT )

You see

He turns toward her pain on his face holding his hand -
And she truly attacks for the first time Smashes her fist
against his head -

He flies back bounces vs the wall

As he comes off it she punches him again -

He roars with rage lunges at her head first great speed -
She hurtles him in the same direction increasing speed -
Right into the opposite wall

The top of his head hits the wall

He shudders like someone in a cartoon a spasm running head
to

TOE -

He drops

Face down
Does not move
At all
She stares at him
Goes to him Wary
Gives him a reflex test -
No reaction Hes unconscious
blocker

it

She tests his neck for a pulse

Apparently hes still alive because she raises her hand
over her head

Her palm vertical like a knife

Shes about to deliver a karate chop

To his neck

it will break his neck

It will kill him

Her hand stays there poised CAMERA PLUNGES IN ON HER FACE

FLASHES

- Mitch hitting her the first time -

- Midwest house Mitch leaping out from Gracies doorway -
- Mitch beating her as she crawls across the floor of
their house (Something we didnt see before) She reaches
up flicks the light switch Mitch jumps on her back -

- Mitch Youll never see Gracie again

- Earlier Shes My daughter Dont even think about
taking her

- Strangling Slim whispering where youre going

BACK TO SLIM

Face contorted in rage confusion -

She brings her hand down -

Misses him

Intentionally

Turns away tears in her eyes

She retrieves her cell phone turns off the cell-phone

presses redial
Stares out the window We see the turmoil on her face hear

in her voice

SLIM

GINNYS VOICE (CONT )

SLIM

GINNYS VOICE (CONT )
Hell come after Gracie -

An indistinct shape something rising over her head

SLIM
I know all that
I have to but I cant
Im not a killer
Im not him
Mitch Crazed and bloody face In his hand the wooden lamp
She senses something turns her head slightly to one side -
- so the lamp does not land quite flush on her skull
Still sends her crashing to the floor
Now she does not move
He stands over her Looks insane bloody dazed beaten but
triumphant
again

GINNYS VOICE
Hello Slim You there
The lamp moving in his hand Hes rotating it A simple
menacing image and we realize he s aoing to hit her

GINNYS VOICE CONT

Answer me

Hes distracted by Ginnys voice Picks up the phone

MITCH
Listen to me bitch
Ginnys silent

MITCH (CONT)

He throws the phone on the couch and moves back toward Slim
lamp clenched tight in his fist

SMASH IN CLOSE ON HER FACE
CLOSER STILL Were almost inside her head as we hear

INSTRUCTORS VOICE
Hold onto my voice

Is that the hint of a smile on her face

INSTRUCTORS VOICE (CONT)

Youre ready

Mitch sees the slight smile cant believe it -

Rage

He pulls his foot back to kick her -

Her eyes are open just a slit -

His foot swinging forward

As it reaches her she grabs it yanks it -

Hes pulled off his feet crashing down on top of her -
But shes already rolling out from under him and up -
Coming to her feet -

He starts to rise all fours then into a crouch and ug
SLOW MOTION Shes ready Her face alert Center of gravity
low Arm lowfist low As her motion unfurls

Boxers say that an uppercut perfectly

executed is the most difficult

powerful and beautiful of punches

Indeed when an uppercut starts low for maximum center-of-
gravity and hits the opponent flush on the point of the chin

as Slims does here - it delivers a devastating message to
the

central nervous system short-circuiting it completely

Mitch flies backward

Theres a table behind him

His head cracks on the table

His neck snaps

He lands on the floor twisted broken

Slim stares at him

Theres no way a living man could assume the position now

occupied by her former husband

She stares in disbelief
Though she knows the answer she feels his carotid artery
Her face registers what she feels Horror relief
She walks slowly to her cell phone picks it up
Listens no one there
She presses redial waits

GINNYS VOICE
(in a panic)
H od

SLIM
Hi

GINNYS VOICE
Oh thank God youre alive

SLIM

Slim nods

GINNYS VOICE

SLIM
Okay

As Ginny talks Slim puts the cell-phone blocker into the
duffle and carries the duffle to the rear of the building

GINNYS VOICE
Youre not him okay Youre not
him and you never will be

SLIM
See you soon
She drops the cell phone out the bedroom window into the
water
Then the duffle They both sink

EXT BROWNSTONE

She comes out sits on the steps A siren is audible
Cop cars speed down the street screech to a stop
TWO COPS LEAP OUT OF THE CAR run toward her

FIRST COP
You okay
