CAMERA ON
IE BACKYARD - SUBURBAN HOUSE - JUDYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

POV of a HOME VIDEO CAMERA shooting into the window of
teenage girls bedroom

The door inside opens In walks JUDY OAKS-KELLEN a
blond haired mousy girl wearing only a T-shirt and

As she heads to the mirror we hear

Sound of skin smacking against skin and heavy breathing
Whoever operates the camera is definitely CHOAKIN THE
GOPHER

Judy combs her hair in the mirror oblivious

The camera operator is in a whack off frenzy as he

CAMERA OPERATOR (0C)
Oh mmph

Hes climaxed

The sounds have stopped but the tape keeps rolling Judy
stops combing her hair as

Camera shuts down

CAMERA ON
EXT HIGH SCHOOL - THE TRACK - DAY
Camera shoots from inside a car hidden camera style as Judy
runs laps during her gym class Judy again has no idea
that she is being filmed as camera zooms in tight
Shes tired sweating profusely and looks completely

miserable She stops running exhausted as the other kids
pass her
settles

Suddenly a very Butch looking female GYM TEACHER walks
over and begins BERATING Judy The Gym Teachers face turns
red as she spews insults inches away from Judys face

We cant hear what shes saying but whatever it is its
cruel harsh and very intense Exhausted and humiliated
Judy holds back tears as

Camera shuts down

CAMERA ON

IE JIMMYS HOUSE - BACKYARDKITCHENLIVING ROOM - DUSK

Late summer evening Camera Operator wipes dirt from the
lens with his shirt revealing his face for the first time as
he looks at camera This is the first time we get even a
glimpse of JIMMY WRIGHT His looks are striking even a
bit awkward but not at all unappealing

He throws a mischievously evil look at the lens then

his face back to normal He spins the camera away pointing
it at the back of his house

Through the kitchen window Jimmy zooms in on his mother
(JIMMYS MOM) (40s) idyllic version of a mom in new
millennium suburban housewife clothes Shes on the phone
preparing dinner

JIMMY (0C)
Hey Mom heard you and Dad doing
the nasty last night Thanks for
that one By the way who the fuck
is Nancy

Camera whips over to JIMMYS DAD in the LIVING ROOM well
dressed rich looking and fat in his late 40s watching

baseball on TV tired after a long days work He drinks

from a tumbler of expensive scotch neat with an ice cube
munching on mixed nuts from a crystal bowl

JIMMY (0C)
Hey Dad Moms on the phone telling
her friends that youre hung like a
light switch

Dad reaches into his pants to give his balls a good scratch
Jimmy gives the play by play like a baseball announcer

JIMMY (0C)
Oh Daddy there he goes He makes
the reach and yes Both balls
at the same time One heck of a
double play

Eyes on the TV Dad takes his hands out of his pants and
sniffs them

JIMMY (0C)
And the sniff to finish it off

Satisfied Dad reaches in and grabs a handful of nuts as he
continues to watch TV We zoom out to see both Mom and Dad
each through different windows

JIMMY (0C)
Fucking freak show

CAMERA ON
INT JIMMYS HOUSE - JIMMYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dark and in silhouette Jimmy flips on the camera by remote
Its too dark to see faces or bodies with any detail but
Jimmys clearly having sex with a PROSTITUTE in his bed She
is young black and looks very much like a prostitute

As he pounds into her
JIMMY
Do you like that nigger Come on
nigger do you like it
PROSTITUTE
(humors him)
Oh yeah baby I like it
By remote Jimmy shuts down the camera

CAMERA ON

INT JIMMYS HOUSE - JIMMYS BEDROOM - NIGHT
Jimmys behind the camera interviewing the Prostitute who
sits up in his bed holding the sheets to cover herself

With
the lights on we can see that shes clearly unattractive
Jimmy asks his questions with a gentle confidence
JIMMY (0C)
Okay so What was going through
your mind when I called you a
nigger
PROSTITUTE
This costs you an extra fifty
JIMMY (0C)
I know
She pauses You can tell she just wants to leave but is
toughing it out for the extra fifty bucks
JIMMY (0C)
Well what did it feel like
Long pause

PROSTITUTE
It felt like nothing

JIMMY (0C)
What do you mean

PROSTITUTE
You aint the first person to call
me a nigger when we was fucking

JIMMY (0C)
(not surprised)
Oh

PROSTITUTE
Johns call me nigger all the time
Especially white guys Nothing
new Just dirty talk

Long awkward pause Jimmy Doesnt know what to say
PROSTITUTE
That it

No reply from Jimmy

PROSTITUTE
What about you You like calling
me nigger You get your nut off

JIMMY (0C)
(calmly)
No

PROSTITUTE
Then whyd ya call me that

JIMMY (0C) (0C)
Have you ever wondered what it was
like to treat someone so completely
cruel that it was unthinkable

No answer

JIMMY (0C)
I was trying to do the unthinkable
and unimaginable when I called you
that I wanted to see if was even
possible for me to do that

They pause

PROSTITUTE
Yeah so

Jimmy speaks softly and confidently

JIMMY (0C)
I think I want to die Like I
dont deserve to live anymore And
that I will never want to do
something like that to someone
again

The prostitute finds Jimmys answer endearing

PROSTITUTE
Why ya wanna die
Pause

JIMMY (0C)
Because everyone hates me

JIMMY (0C)
They hate me because I seek beauty
and appreciate destruction They
hate my mind my thoughts my
imagination They hate everything
about me And I hate them

PROSTITUTE
(trying not to care)
Really

JIMMY (0C)
Yep Everyone Everyone that
knows or who has ever met me

PROSTITUTE
Your parents dont hate you Look
at this room in this big ole house
you got

JIMMY (0C)
My parents provide me with food and
shelter because they have been
conditioned by society into
thinking its the appropriate thing
to do In reality they cant stand
to be in the same room with me
Theyre fascists brainwashed and
unforgiving

(MORE)

JIMMY (OC) (contd)
They dismiss my feelings of ill
regard towards them on simple
rebelliousness of youth but thats
only because they are patently and
intentionally unaware of their own
hypocrisies

Prostitute looks boredfrustrated again

JIMMY (0C)
(accidental condescension)
Do you understand me
she

PROSTITUTE
You wanna know what I think

JIMMY
Yes I really do

PROSTITUTE
I think youre a spoiled ass white
boy thinks you everything but you
dont know shit All you do is
bullshit complain and theres folks
out there thatd kill for all this

Jimmy doesnt react

PROSTITUTE
I dont feel sorry for you

JIMMY (0C)
(calmly)
No one is asking you to Thank you
for letting me film you

school parking lot bleachers in the distance School is
letting out as he zooms in on Judy
Shes looking at the ground as shes taunted by a group of
Other Harassing Teenagers a tear streaming down the side of
her cheek
Suddenly Judy is bashed in the face with a school bag She
falls to the ground then picks up her broken glasses as

camera zooms out to catch the Girl who hit her (Mean Girl)

Nearby a big Dumb Looking Bully Type taunts her as
cries His taunts are biting and as excessive as the Mean
Girls then he dumps a cup of soda on Judys head as shes

crying

Judy screams at the top of her lungs The group runs off

with her friends then whips pans back to Judy now on her

CAMERA ON
IE JUDYS HOUSE - JUDYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

A scene weve seen before Jimmy is off camera videotaping
Judy through her bedroom window We hear him FLOGGIN THE
DOLPHIN off screen while Judy combs her hair in the mirror
She stops when she hears

A Grown Man walks into the doorway of her bedroom
This is JUDYS DAD He comes in and doesnt say a thing to
her Judy doesnt acknowledge him at all and continues
combing her hair as though hes not even there

He comes up behind her then wraps his arms around her
giving her a warm hug from behind Somethings not right
The masturbation sounds STOP

Judys noticeably uncomfortable but doesnt resist as her
Father begins kissing her neck His hand slowly creeps down
to her pelvic area his other hand turning out the bedroom

turned around to face the camera during any of the clips

She sits still

She trembles but doesnt turn around She collects herself
but still doesnt turn around Jimmy holds the camera
steady

Still she doesnt turn around

She fidgets in her seat but still doesnt turn around

She now sits still on the edge of the bed like she is ina
trance but still doesnt turn around to face the camera

No movement

She begins to breath heavily

Then no movement

She leans her head down towards the floor
Then no movement

Still no movement or any reaction for that matter Its

she is in a trance and cant wake up

Jimmy (OC) continues to roll without budging

Still no movement

It looks like shes about to turn around She moves her head

in the direction of the camera then assumes her original
position facing the TV
Then no movement

Still no movement

Then Judy collapses onto the bed Jimmy still rolling gets
off the bed and begins filming her as she lies on the floor
crying hysterically

Judy cries and cries and cries and cries She then lets out
a cry from the depths of her soul The cry is long hard
and loud

Jimmy gets up then stands above her with the camera

She rolls over on her back and is now facing directly into
the camera She tries to collect herself

JUDY

Judy stops realizing suddenly that shes been screaming
Camera shuts down

CAMERA ON
INT JIMMYS HOUSE - STAIRWAYENTRYWAYLIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jimmys behind the camera He stands at the head of the
stairs shooting down Sounds of a dinner party just getting
started come from downstairs He walks down the steps into
the party

A generic Happy Twentieth Anniversary sign hangs above the
front door Camera pans awkwardly to a lame K-Mart style
studio portrait on the wall Its Jimmys parents wearing
saccharine sweet smiles Dads hair slicked back Mom in an
overdone hair-do and in way too colorful clothing

Gifts sit on the entry-way table Party Guests are dressed
nicely and are mingling in the house drinks in hand Dinner
is yet to start As Jimmy moves into the

ENTRY-WAY

People at the party all turn to camera a look of shock on
their faces as Jimmy walks through

More and more people react with gasps and revulsion at
camera but we cant tell why Jimmy moves camera to the

LIVING ROOM
The place is full of More Party Guests Frame moves across a
huge mirror on the wall over a cocktail bar We catch a

glimpse of Jimmys image and realize

Jimmy is completely NAKED and has PAINTED HIS ENTIRE BODY
SILVER

Camera quickly turns away from the mirror as some people run
from the room
One of the Female Party Guests SCREAMS

FEMALE PARTY GUEST 1
(covers her mouth)
Oh my God

Jimmy keeps filming catching peoples reactions
He points the camera at a Female Party Guest 2

JIMMY (0C)
Hey great party huh Im making
a tape for my parents Want to say
something to them

Female Party Guest 2 is just too stunned to speak

JIMMYS MOM (0C)
Jimmy

Jimmy turns the camera at his mother who is completely
shocked to see him like this

JIMMY (0C)
Hey Mom Happy anniversary You
want to say anything to yourself

JIMMYS DAD
Thats enough

Jimmys Dad runs into the room and throws a blanket over
Jimmys head body and the camera All we see is black and
flashes of light from under the blanket
JIMMYS DAD (0C)
(muffled)

Get out Now

Cameras under the blanket as we hear Jimmys Dad pushes him
from the room Camera shuts down

CAMERA ON
INT THERAPISTS OFFICE - DAY

Camera is being removed from the camera bag As the lens
pans quickly we catch a glimpse of Jimmy smirking holding
the camera Hes way too close to the lens

He flips it around until it locks on DR WALTERS MFCC Jimmys not very accomplished therapist Walters seems to
have a very gentle and nonthreatening aura that suggests

the type of person you would feel comfortable talking to He
sits by the window in his relatively uninteresting office
Jimmy has turned on the camera in the middle of their first
session together

DR WALTERS
Jimmy we discussed this You
cant tape our sessions Its not
allowed

The camera doesnt move

DR WALTERS
You know you cant film someone
who doesnt want their image and
voice recorded Technically
youre actually breaking the law

Jimmy (OC) doesnt respond

DR WALTERS
Does your defiance make you feel
more powerful

Still no answer

DR WALTERS
Filming people makes you feel like
youre in control of the situation
doesnt it

Still no answer

DR WALTERS
I can sit here as long as you can
Youre not going to be able to
force me to participate in your
little game here

No movement from the camera
DR WALTERS
Jimmy this isnt something that
friends do to each other is it

Dr Walters sits in front of the camera trying to stay

perfectly still and calm

Dr Walters is so nice and so calm that we start to feel

sorry for him

No movement

No movement

Dr Walters fidgets

Then holds still

Then fidgets trying to stay calm

DR WALTERS
Jimmy put the camera away please

No movement
DR WALTERS
Youre wasting your time and mine
Jimmy We could be doing something
productive
The camera shakes a bit Jimmys laughing

Dr Walters is doing his best to stay calm

DR WALTERS
Thats enough

No movement

DR WALTERS
Put it away

Nothing

DR WALTERS

Dr Walters gets up and comes towards the camera
it just above the lens and tries to take it away

He grabs

Walters

Jimmy is filming Judy who is sitting on his bed Her face
is red her eyes have watered up and her nose is snotty and
running from after an intense session of crying Jimmy is
catching her seconds after shes has finally composed
herself

JIMMY (0C)
Say what you said to me before

JUDY
I dont know how I said it

JIMMY (0C)
Paraphrase it then

JUDY
Do what

JIMMY (0C)
Say it like you did before but it
doesnt have to be exactly the
same

JUDY
You mean paraphrase it

JIMMY (0C)
Thats what I said

JUDY
I didnt hear you

Judy stares off camera

JIMMY (0C)
Are you ready

JUDY
Im waiting for you

JIMMY (0C)
OK

JUDY
Tell me when

JIMMY (0C)
Now
JUDY
You want me to paraphrase it

JIMMY (0C)

(impatient)
Yes

Judy thinks for a beat

JUDY
I cant remember what I said

JIMMY (0C)
Then just ad-lib

JUDY
Ad-lib

JIMMY (0C)
Yes

Judy thinks for a beat

JUDY
I dont know what that means

JIMMY (0C)
(getting frustrated)
It means make it up

JUDY
(confused)
Do you want me to make something up
or paraphrase what I did the first
time

This isnt working The camera drops from Judy

JIMMY (0C)
Lets take a break

Camera shuts down
CAMERA ON
INT JIMMYS HOUSE - JIMMYS BEDROOM - DAY

Cameras on a tripod Jimmy sits in a chair the back of his
shoulder foregrounds Judy

JUDY
Im not good on camera It makes
me nervous

JIMMY
Forget about the camera Talk to
me
JUDY
OK
JIMMY

Tell me what you said earlier
About me about how you felt when
you saw the video

JUDY
(relaxes)
It felt like someone had been
reading my mind

She stops

JIMMY
Go on

JUDY
It was like someone had jumped into
my head and watched what was being
projected

Now Judy completely has forgotten that the camera is there

JIMMY
And earlier what you said about
God
Jimmy zooms in the camera by remote Judys distracted
JIMMY
(off her look)
Tell me

Judy refocuses

JUDY
I said that it felt like God had
sent someone to protect me and to
look out for me

She looks at Jimmy as if he is an angel

JUDY
And I said that you are the only
person in my life who has ever
looked after me like that

Judy tries to stifle tears but theyre starting to flow
again As camera zooms in further Judy catches sight of
Jimmys finger on the remote and BLOWS HER FUCKING TOP
leaping from her chair

JUDY
God I hate it when you film me
crying

Judy goes for the camera struggling to get it off the
tripod she finally frees it and points it at Jimmy

JUDY (OC)
How do you like it huh How do
you like having a camera shoved
right up your ass

Cameras framed poorly moves around a lot goes in and out
of focus etc

JUDY (0C)
Do you like it Do you

JIMMY
I dont like it or dislike Im
used to it

Judy moves the camera directly in his face The lens is
millimeters away from his nose We see an extreme close up
of his nostrils

JIMMY
Generally Id place the camera
further away from my nose but if
this is your preferred shooting

style then I guess Ill have to
adjust to it

Jimmy leans in and rests his nose on the lens

JIMMY
Hows this work for you

Judy pulls back and continues filming him

JUDY (0C)
Give me a break

JIMMY
OK
Now Judys the interviewer Her framing is not quite as
adept as Jimmys
JUDY (0C)
So why do you have to film
everything
JIMMY

I dont film everything

JUDY (0C)
Why do you like to film me crying

JIMMY
I dont

JUDY (0C)
Then why do you

JIMMY
Because its rare that I get to
find someone that lets their
emotions go When a person is
crying I mean truly crying or
truly laughing or smiling or
frowning or gasping For a few
seconds or minutes I get a chance
to see that persons soul And
really now that youve forced me
to think about it I think its a
very rare and beautiful thing to be

afforded that opportunity
Judy is shaken and speechless

JIMMY
Anything else

Judys moved and forgets herself Camera drops from Jimmy

JUDY (O0C)
Why me

Jimmy helps her put the camera back up on him

JIMMY
Because
Jimmy sits still Judy doesnt know what to do with that
JIMMY

Why do you think
Judy doesnt have an answer

Jimmy reaches forward and takes the camera away from her and
turns the interview around

JIMMY (0C)
Why you and why me Why are we
together right now

Judy doesnt know what to say

JIMMY (0C)
Go ahead say it I want you to I
know what youre going to say so
just say it

JUDY
Stop

JIMMY (0C)
(soft)
Tell me

Judy fidgets
JIMMY (0C)
(bullies her)
Tell me

Judy fidgets again then

JUDY
(blows her top)
Because were both fucking weird

Judy pauses The pressure of the camera from Jimmy makes her
feel like she has to give him more

JUDY
Because were the two weirdest kids
in the world And God made us for
each other and I fucking love you
and you did all this because you
love me too and fuck everyone and
everything that doesnt get it

Judys out of breath Camera still points at her

JUDY
Thats right right

Judy stares back at the camera longing for an answer from
Jimmy She told him she loved him Camera shuts down

CAMERA ON

JUDY (0C)

Fine
Judy sulks for a second

JUDY (0C)
Jimmy can I ask you something

JIMMY
Anything

JUDY (0C)
Do you hate your parents

JIMMY
Yes but I understand them

JUDY (0C)
Whats to understand

JIMMY
Lots of things

JUDY (0C)
Like what

JIMMY
I understand that my ascension into
young adulthood triggered their
descent into mid-life crisis
Generally when an only child leaves
the nest the parents begin
reassessing their own lives They
see us as a younger better version
of themselves

(MORE)

JIMMY (contd)
They feel abandoned by our need for
privacy and insecure because we no
longer seek their approval They
used to take us to baseball games
and cover our scrapes with
bandages but once we no longer
need Mom to nurture our bruises or
Dad to be our hero it puts their
roles and subsequent sense of self
worth into question

JUDY (0C)
How do you know all these things

JIMMY
When you dont have any friends
dont play sports dont go out
have no one talk to nowhere to go
no one to listen to you or no one
to help you figure things out you
sort of have to figure things out
by yourself And without any of
those things I have nothing but
time to think about stuff

JUDY (0C)
You are SO smart

JIMMY
You are so beautiful

Long pause Judy doesnt know how to react

JUDY (0C)
You think Im pretty

JIMMY
I think youre the most beautiful
person I have ever met The most
beautiful person in the universe

JUDY (0C)
No one has ever told me that

JIMMY
Get used to hearing it

JUDY (0C)
Do you think Im smart

JIMMY
Yes

JUDY (0C)

JUDY (0C)

Judy tilts the camera down

IN A FLASH we see a lifelike dildo sticking out of Jimmys
fly a smiley face sticker covers the head The camera
quickly shakes and spins off the image as Judy screams
bloody
fucking murder

Jimmy laughs Judy forgets the camera is on She drops it
into her lap fabric from her clothes covers the frame

We can hear Jimmy and Judy laughing hysterically

JUDY (0C)
I cant believe you did that

JIMMY (0C)
Thats why I did it Now come on

We hear the rustling of Judys clothing Camera falls to her
feet on the floor of the car Theres silence Off camera
Judys nervously showing Jimmy her breasts

Judy looks nervous but gives in She unhooks her bra from
the front and exposes her naked breasts for as long as she
can Jimmy focusses the cameras attention on them Its
too much for her She quickly pulls her shirt back down

Jimmy tilts up to a close up of Judys face
JUDY
(struggling)

Judys eyes are starting to well up as she tries not to cry

JIMMY (0C)

moment of my life

Judy leans towards Jimmy then suddenly attacks him and
shoves the camera to the side They are making out
exuberantly The camera shakes and wobbles We can hear
heavy breathing and the two of them smashing up against the
interior of the car

Jimmy finally has the camera in position He has one of his
arms extended and now we can see the two of them kissing

Judys devouring him in that raging teenage hormone sort of
way
eating

JIMMY
One sec

Jimmys bare ass flashes us as he heads out the bedroom
Judy holds the camera as we hear Jimmy in the hallway He
opens a closet door fumbles through it then busts back
the bedroom holding the shotgun he used out on the lake
Jimmy zooms in on Jimmys naked upper body as he stands in
front of her and begins pumping the gun and pulling the

trigger Obviously the gun is not loaded

Judy points the gun at Jimmy She lowers it aiming right

his crotch just below frame

JIMMY

camera
Judy hands Jimmy the camera Camera moves and shakes as

hands it over

Jimmy frames her up nicely Now we see Judy topless
pointing the gun directly at the lens of the camera

JUDY
What do you think of this

She brings the gun down then takes the barrel of the gun

places it between her breasts squishing them together
covering her nipples as she rubs the barrel between her
breasts

JUDY
Do you like that

JIMMY (0C)
Yes

Judy takes the barrel of the gun from her breasts and near
her mouth She starts rolling her tongue over the top of the
barrel slowly and seductively then stops It looks as if
shes about to perform full mock oral sex on the barrel of
the gun

JIMMY (0C)
That is SO hot

As she is about to start to move her mouth and lips over the
gun then suddenly we hear a garage door open

Jimmy throws the camera sideways down on the bed

JIMMY (0C)

We are now seeing sideways rotated images of Jimmy and Judy
panicking throwing on their clothes as fast as humanly
possible

Jimmy grabs the camera off the bed and turns it off

CAMERA ON

INT JIMMYS HOUSE - PARENTS BEDROOM - DAY
Jimmy is hiding in the closet of his parents bedroom He
has the door of the closet cracked and puts the lens of the

camera through the crack

Jimmys Dad enters the room He has no idea that he is being
filmed and that Jimmy is in the closet

Jimmys Dad walks over to the dresser opens up the top
drawer and pulls something out Its too dark in the room to
tell exactly what hes pulled out but it appears to

some sort of undergarment

Jimmys Dad begins undressing then steps out of frame
After a beat he reappears Now hes wearing nothing but a
sequined teddy Hes totally fat hairy and nasty looking
He sits on the side of the bed his back to us Now we see
that what he grabbed out of the drawer was actually a pair

fishnet stockings He begins putting them on

When he is finished putting on his panty hose he gets up

the bed and begins admiring his legs in a mirror He begins
to gently stroke the sides of his legs relishing the feel

the hose over his hands and fingertips

He seems to be lip syncing the words to a song and begins to
get all worked up He shakes his hips and dances around the
room for a few seconds

Now Jimmys Dad goes to the dresser and pulls out a long
brunette wig from the back of his top drawer Putting it on
with the fishnet stockings sequined teddy and long wig he
has transformed himself into the worlds fattest ugliest
hairiest Cher look-a-like

Someone else enters the room

JIMMYS DAD
Hi sweety

Holy shit Its Jimmys Mom and shes wearing a leather
dominatrix outfit

JIMMYS MOM
Are you ready for me you fucking
slut

JIMMYS DAD
Not quite

JIMMYS MOM
I dont feel like waiting Hurry
up bitch What do you have left to
do

JIMMYS DAD
I just need to put on my makeup

As Jimmys Mom exits frame we see Jimmys Dad go to the
mirror He opens up the top drawer again and pulls out a
little makeup bag

Jimmys Mom re-enters now wearing a mini leather bikers
hat carrying a riding switch

JIMMYS MOM
Come on slut

Jimmys Dad finishes applying his lipstick and moves over to
the bed By the way Jimmys parents are behaving its as if
theyve gone through this routine a thousand times

Jimmys Mom drifts off screen as Jimmys Dad gets up on all
fours Suddenly we hear a SMACK as Jimmys Mom hits Jimmys
Dad on his ass with the switch

He lets out deep pleasured groans as she continues SMACKING
him with the whip harder and harder He yelps squeals and
gyrates his hips back and forth then starts dry humping the
air until she stops
bed

as

behind

Jimmys Mom comes back through and out of frame Jimmys Dad
pushes his belly into the bed groaning from the pain while
he waits for her return

She comes back moving quickly across the screen wearing an
enormous strap on dildo

Disappearing out of frame again Jimmys Dad gets himself
ready for her one more time ass up on all fours on the

From behind we can see her hand as she hikes her husbands
dress up his back then we see his face and hear him grunt

she rips his fishnets off screen

Theres a pause Nothing seems to be happening but Jimmys
Dad is bracing himself for something His face tightens up
Off screen Jimmys Mom has started mounting him from

Jimmy cant take it any longer As he slowly emerges from
the closet his Mom notices Jimmy almost immediately She
jumps off her husband screaming bloody murder

Cameras shaky but its easy to guess whats been happening
Moms just started doing Dad from behind with the strap on

JIMMY
Hi mom Hi dad What are you guys
up to

Jimmys Dad leaps from the bed and begins shouting He looks
completely absurd screaming at Jimmy wearing his sequined
dress and wig

JIMMYS DAD
What the fuck are you doing here

Jimmys Mom goes hysterical and begins screaming at Jimmys
Dad

JIMMYS MOM
(to his dad)
I told you he would find out you

fucking psycho Look a his father

Jimmys Dad is beside himself with fury and throws off his
wig

JIMMYS DAD
Turn off the that fucking camera

Jimmy is loving it

JIMMY
Gee dad what do you say the two of
us go out to the front yard and
throw some ball together Well

Jimmys Dad attacks Jimmy He swings at the lens Hes one
angry drag queen daddy He begins strangling Jimmy

JIMMYS DAD
You little mother fucker Turn off
that fucking camera

Jimmys Mom rips off her strap on dildo and begins beating
Jimmys Dad with it

Judging from the punishment shes inflicting upon her drag
queen husband the dildo apparently is made from the finest
and heaviest of materials

JIMMYS MOM
Stop it Youre going to kill him

Jimmys Dad lets go The dildos doing the trick

JIMMYS DAD
Bitch

Jimmys Mom keeps swinging the dildo at Jimmys Dad even
though hes let go

JIMMYS MOM

shit

JIMMY
(laughing)
Mom

Jimmys Mom now directs her attention on Jimmy She screams
at him as she swings her gigantic strap on towards the
camera

JIMMYS MOM
You little beast You want to film
something Film this

She continues to swing the strap on as she walks closer and
closer to the lens

The camera goes crazy Loud sounds are heard throughout the
room Evidently Jimmy has been tackled We hear wrestling
and grunting It seems that Jimmys Dad has tackled Jimmy
or maybe his Mom or both but the camera is too shaky to
tell just what has happened

Jimmys Dad is still fighting He seems to have them all
pinned against the floor Hes crushing his mother

JIMMYS DAD (0C)
Nancy Nancy Nancy Nancy Please

Nancy

JIMMYS MOM (0C)

love of God Call your daddy

We hear Jimmys Mom screamingrepeating herself We see a
hand go over the lens Jimmy and his mother and father are
all in a wrestling match on the floor

Jimmy with great enthusiasm begins to sing as the camera
shakes

JIMMY (0C)
Take me out to the ball game take
me out to the crowd buy me some
peanuts and crackerjacks

The wrestling match continues as we see more hands come
towards the lens Jimmys Mom suddenly stops screaming as
if shes been knocked out

JIMMYS DAD (0C)

shut the camera off

into the car hitting Judy right in the face

Judy screams The car full of Three Teenagers laugh
hysterically at her expense

Jimmy hands Judy the camera

JIMMY

want to tape this

Jimmy calmly gets out of his car as Judy tapes him through
the window We can hear her breathing heavily as she tries
not to cry softly off camera

Jimmy has gone to the rear of the car We hear the trunk
open while Judy films through the windshield at the car full
of laughing teens Jimmy enters the frame carrying a
baseball bat

We see him talking calmly to the driver of the car the Kid
who spat in Judys face Then

WHAM

Jimmy reels back and clocks the kid right in the face with
the bat The Kid falls over into the front seat of the car

Jimmy calmly walks over to the front of the car and begins
bashing in the windshield

to them and continues bashing the car

Now its to the point of overkill But Jimmy wont stop
Its as if the rage hes been carrying inside of him his
entire life is now coming to the surface

the distance

Judy begins screaming

pulls up Two policemen get out of the car They are
temporarily paralyzed with indecision

We see one of the officers trying to speak with Jimmy He
just ignores them The policemen are oblivious to the fact
they are being filmed

One of the officers gets out a can of mace and sprays it in
Jimmys face

Now Jimmy is completely freaking out We hear him scream
but he continues to bash the car with his eyes closed One
of the cops draws his gun as Jimmy swings aimlessly towards
them He gets sprayed again with the mace and is now
completely blinded A huge crowd has now amassed outside of
the grocery store

camera and runs out the door The camera is face down on the

can hear the entire scene with much more intensity The
sounds of police sirens and radios is overwhelming

We hear a woman screaming and more sirens and cars are
pulling up More screaming and sounds on the radio is heard
We hear police chatter

POLICE CHATTER (0C)

More screaming and chatter is heard until someone enters the
car We dont know who it is They turn off the camera

Judy flips the camera around to herself

JUDY

Jimmy looks at the camera

JIMMY
Thats what I fucking missed more

The Drive Thru window voice rattles off a price and tells
him
to pull up Jimmy continues to camera

JUDY (0C)

Masturbated mostly

JUDY (0C)
(jokingly)
You cheated on me I want to be
the only person responsible for
making you cum

JIMMY
I hope youre willing to be on call
twenty four hours a day

JUDY (OC)
Seriously what did you do What
was a day in the life of Jimmy in
the nut house

JIMMY
Well besides masturbating I
talked and talked and talked and
fucking talked until they were
satisfied But basically I told
them what they wanted to hear I
said shit like

Jimmy does an over the top mock sincerity speech

JIMMY
Now that Im finally able to talk
about my problems I now realize
that my behavior was inappropriate
and harmful to others

Judy laughs

JIMMY
Then I figured it out I had to
cry as much as possible Whenever
someone would cry theyd call ita
break through So Id be like

Jimmy does an imitation of himself in therapy He looks
directly into the lens

JIMMY
You start out slow then you build
it up like this Now I know
that using violence is not the

answer

Jimmy is getting progressively sappier and more over the top
with his self impersonation

JIMMY
industrial

Then you go like this
(snaps back into the
impersonation)
I was wrong I know I was wrong and
Tll never do it again I dont
want to hurt people or myself

Jimmy does an obnoxious fake cry

JIMMY

Boo hoo waaaaaa boo-hoo-hoo
waaaaaaa

(snaps out of it)
Then you always give them the
obligatory hug at the end After a
couple of weeks then they
officially diagnose you with
something give you a prescription
then youre done

JUDY (0C)
God youre a genius

Jimmy pulls up to the drive through window and pays the
Cashier who hands him the a paper bag of food

Jimmy pulls away and parks Judy continues to question him
as he goes through his bag of food

JUDY (0C)
So what did they say you have

Jimmy munches on some fries

JIMMY

Disorder

JUDY (0C)

Youre so lucky I wish I was
diagnosed with something What
does it mean
Jimmy pretends he is reading from a text book 50s

spoof style

JIMMY
nipples

ODD is a disorder characterized by
an overwhelming pattern of
negative hostile and defiant
behavior which causes severe
delusions where the patient can no
longer distinguish fantasy from
reality

JUDY (0C)
Wow I love that

Jimmy smiles as he gets his burger out of the paper bag He
then opens the top bun of the burger to examine if they got
his order correct They didnt

Jimmy playfully begins to act crazy

JIMMY
You see They fucked up my order
I specifically asked for no
pickles

JUDY (0C)
(playing along)
Oh no How will ODD Boy handle
this Will his ODD brain be able
to withstand a pickle screw up at
the drive thru

Jimmy goes into a cartoonish like crazy person character

He begins by taking the pickles off of his burger He puts
the burger down quickly lifts his shirt holding it up with
his chin while he places two pickles over top of his

Jimmy yells

JIMMY
Ooow jeez theyre hot I burnt
my nipples with the pickles

Judy cracks up laughing Jimmy takes a pickle off of his
left nipple and dangles it directly in front of the lens

He then feeds it to Judy We hear Judy chomping on the
pickle and giggling off camera The camera shakes then shuts
down

the

window On the sidewalk he catches glimpses Drug Dealers a

Crack Whore a Drunk stumbling along and Other Pretty

Sketchy Characters

JIMMY (0C)
I love the ghetto I dont know
what it is about it I fucking
love it Its always the first
place I go to when I get out

JUDY
I love it when youre out of the
looney bin Do you think you might
be able to try to avoid the place
for a while

JIMMY (0C)
(joking)
If they dont send me to the bin
maybe theyll send me to jail

This upsets Judy

JUDY

big deal when you go away

JIMMY (0C)

her

JIMMY (0C)

Judy looks over at him

JIMMY (0C)
I promise I swear on my life and
I swear on our bond Ill never go

believe you

Judy lets out half cry and half yelp Her emotions are a
bit
out of control
JUDY
I love you so fucking much
JIMMY (OC)
I love you too
Awkward silence Judy looks like she wants to ask Jimmy
something
JIMMY (0C)
Whats the matter

JUDY
I was thinking the last time you
got out we did it like five times
like as soon as we saw each other
we got naked and started doing it
And today my parents werent even
home and I tried to do some stuff
to you but you were acting like
you werent interested

JIMMY (0C)
I didnt mean to

JUDY
Was it because you jerked off so
much while you were locked up

Jimmy hands her a small bottle of whiskey She takes a
sizable gulp makes a face then hands it back to Jimmy

JIMMY (0C)
No

Judy is getting upset again

JUDY
(voice cracking)
Then why dont you want to have sex
with me Jimmy You dont think Im
pretty anymore

JIMMY (0C)
No no no That has nothing to do
with it After I saw my dad being
rammed in the ass by my mother I
kind of blocked it out but when I
was in there they kept talking to
me and talking to me about it Now
I cant stop it from coming into my
head Every time I get wood the
instant replay machine in my brain
projects this image of my Mom
pounding into my Dad

JUDY
God thats awful I didnt know

JIMMY (0C)
Yeah well you know you didnt give
too much of an effort to get in my
pants anyhow You just sort of
made your sex face and grabbed my
crotch
Judy takes another drink off the bottle of whiskey and
smiles

JUDY
How do you like this

While she is driving she pulls down her tank top and quickly
exposes her breasts through the top of her shirt

JIMMY (0C)
Now were talking

Judy tries to position her body so her breasts are in frame
She begins pushing one up then sticks out her tongue
teasing

JIMMY (0C)
That is so hot

Judy smiles and looks over at the camera One hand on the
steering wheel and one on her breast when

JIMMY (0C)
Watch out

BOOM
A loud THUMP hits the car shaking the camera

JIMMY (0C)
I think you hit someone

Judys in shock Jimmy puts the camera on the floor of the
car by the passenger seat He forgets to turn it off

All we see is a close up of the floor and Jimmys feet

JIMMY (0C)
Stay here

Jimmy gets out of the car We hear the car door open then
close

Judy sounds like she is having a complete nervous breakdown
Shes crying but in an extremely nervous and frantic way

JUDY (0C)
(calls to him)
Oh my God what are you doing
We have no clue what Jimmy is doing outside of the car

The cop taps his flashlight against the window
We hear Judy roll down her power window and we hear the
voice
of the Cop

The light from the Cops flashlight reflects off the floor
of

the car and into the lens of the camera
The reflections stop The wait is unbearable

COP (0C)

Could you please step out of the
vehicle

Jimmy gets out of the car as Judy trembles in the passengers
seat

We only hear the sounds of Judy sniffling and repressing
herself from crying and idle chatter of the Cops radio

It seems like forever then
THUMP

The car is shaking we hear intense struggling going on
outside

Judy unleashes a piercing high pitched scream

JUDY (0C)

Music is playing extremely loud in a funky ass trailer as
Judy dances with DINKO (late 20s) a completely drunk trailer
trash dude wearing a pizza delivery outfit

Empty whiskey and beer bottles are scattered throughout the
tiny living room as cigarette smoke hovers around them due

a ridiculously low ceiling

Judy is dancing in a very sexy manner with Dinko who is
dancing like a complete dork Dinko has no moves rhythm or
beat whatsoever but dances with as much vigor as a dog on
crack

Jimmy is sitting on the couch filming them dancing in front
of him Dinko is forced to scream over top of the music to
be heard He looks directly at Jimmy noticing that Jimmys
turned on the camera

DINKO

Dinko gets up and moves into the kitchen area

crossing the

items in the kitchen while Dinko talks

everywhere as if Dinkos been taking everything apart and

trying to put it back together

DINKO

cardboard boxes with bags of drugs in them

DINKO (0C)
Right right I forgot Yeah

JUDY (0C)

Judy is too stoned to realize that Jimmy has already told

about Uncle Rodney

Jimmy pulls out to include Judy in the shot Shes in the
kitchen doing another line of crank off a counter top

JUDY
I want to meet your uncle

JIMMY (0C)
Hes not my uncle Hes not
anybodys uncle People just call

As Judy bends down to snort her line camera drifts over to
Dinko whos holding a HUGE HILLBILLY WAD OF CASH in his hand
and stuffs it into a box of cereal Jimmy zooms in on the
cereal box Theres a whole bunch more cash in there

JIMMY (0C)

is dancing like a stripper directly in front of the camera

JUDY

Judy keeps on dancing in her own little world while Dinko
goes to the door Judy finishes her bottle of beer Shes
pretty drunk and cranked out at this point

Dinko is at the front door dealing with a customer We cant
see her and we can barely hear what theyre talking about

but it seems Dinko is engaged in a heated conversation with
her He yells back into the living room from the front door

DINKO (0C)

Dinko brings in HAZEL a frightfully thin crank addict
Shes scared nervous and completely strung out and she
looks like death They stand off to the side of the room
watching Judy dance

Judy realizes the woman is in the room and stops dancing

Jimmy zooms in on the woman Looking closer we see that
Hazel is in the final stages of her lifeaddiction Shes

sweating and her eyes are bugging out of her skull
Dinko turns the music down so they dont have to scream

JIMMY (0C)

gyrating Elvis hips as he jams on his acoustic guitar

Jimmy motions to the camera to turn around

JIMMY

ELVIS (0C)
You aint nothing but a young
bride walking down the aisle

The camera whips around and we see Judy walking down the
aisle Tears of joy run down Judys heavily made up face as
she walks

ELVIS
Well if you dont marry Jimmy

Judy makes her way over to her side of the altar next to her
bridesmaids (two Cher look-a-likes)

ELVIS

Elvis is looking for Judys name thats been scribbled on
paper

JIMMY

Judy And here we wrote our own
vows

He hands Elvis a small piece of paper who skims it He kind
of shakes his head smirking at what he reads then decides
to go for it

Elvis gives a quick windmill strum to his guitar and starts

ELVIS

swallow to never cut your hair or
have another mans penis injected
into any part of your body for as
long as you both shall live

The Cher bridesmaids giggle

Siegfried gives the rings to Jimmy who places one on Judys
finger and vice versa

out

note the producers here at KPX-TV
4 would like to warn you that the
images we are about to show are
violent and graphic in nature and
may not be suitable for young
children Once again these are
the images that were taken from a
video camera that was mounted on
board the patrol car Viewer
discretion is advised

Judy gasps involuntarily as

INT LAS VEGAS - LAS VEGAS MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Jimmy pulls the camera from the screen and points it at Judy
to get her reaction Her eyes are locked on the screen

Judys face drops We on the other hand are dying to see
what shes looking at

Jimmy swish pans back to the TV and zooms in tight The
television fills the frame

EXT GHETTO - COP CAR CAM (FOR VEGAS MOTEL) - NIGHT

(From Sc 37 p 64) On screen we see something completely
new Its a black and white security cam style video image
Just as the announcer described this is the kind of image

that comes from a video camera thats mounted on the inside
of a Cop Car Its static and covered with datetime text

etc

On TV we finally get a chance to see what transpired when
Jimmy and Judy were pulled over Judy is standing outside
the cop car The moment she sees it approach we see her
freak just a bit and get into the car quickly and
suspiciously The cop gets up gets out of the car and goes
over to the driver side to talk to Jimmy After a few
moments he summons Jimmy out of the car while Judy waits

The Cop asks Jimmy to open the trunk He doesnt have his
gun drawn but he is being cautious one hand on his gun
holster the other shining on Jimmys face with a

flashlight

finally

COP
(on TV)
Go ahead and open it
Jimmy stands by the trunk of the car but hes not really
obeying the Cops commands Hes stalling The Cop is
getting suspicious We can barely hear what theyre saying
to each other over the noise of traffic that whizzes by

Theres an unintelligible exchange then the cop steps
forward raising his voice

COP
(on TV)
Put your hands on the vehicle
Jimmys reluctant
COP

(on TV)
On the vehicle now

The Cop and Jimmy are sort of at a standoff Jimmy
leans over and puts his hands on the trunk

The Cop comes in close to Jimmy pulling his hand from his
gun holster and shifting it to pull his cuffs off his belt

At that exact moment Jimmy makes his move LEAPING for the
Cop

He takes the Cop to the ground and off screen

All we see is a barely decipherable image of Judy freaking
out in the passenger seat because she cant see whats going
on and neither can we

About 5 seconds go by

BOOM

A gunshot is fired

It feels like an eternity then

Jimmy pops up off the ground Hes got the Cops gun He
of

seat

hesitates not knowing what to do He pauses hesitant then
shoots down towards the ground where the cop is lying out

frame

He runs around the front of the car and into the driver

Theres a moment of hesitation as Jimmy and Judy seem to be
screaming at each other in the car then

Jimmy slams on the gas and the car takes off into the
distance

The image on the TV cuts away and back to the Anchorman

come to the sober realization that he killed a cop in cold
blood for her

Charles Manson but hes able to maintain a stoic but
nonetheless dangerous demeanor as Jimmy begins setting up

camera

Like a prison inmate or rabid dog you get the feeling that
Uncle Rodney could EXPLODE on you at any second

Jimmy moves the camera around the room so we briefly see the
interior of the trailer Its an ELABORATE triple
combination of a middle eastern harem sixties psychedelic
motif and white trashjunk-yard memorabilia
dog

she

JUST OUT OF FRAME we hear a female voice crying softly
whimpering The voice is close in the room with us but we
cant see whos making the sounds Uncle Rodney ignores it
completely

Camera shakes indicating that Jimmy is exceptionally
nervous

JIMMY (0C)
Just one second

UNCLE RODNEY
Take your time man I want you to
feel comfortable More
importantly I want you to get this
right

Finally the camera stops shaking Jimmy zooms out to a

medium shot revealing that Uncle Rodney has HAZEL lying next
to him on the bed with her head on his lap

Uncle Rodney gently strokes her hair like hes petting a
Hazel in the midst of EXTREME withdrawals cries and
whimpers like a child oblivious to Jimmy the camera and
everything else in the world except for Uncle Rodney

She is so strung out and her cravings are so intense that

can barely speak

JIMMY (0C)
Im ready whenever you are

Uncle Rodney looks down upon Hazel

UNCLE RODNEY
Just a second I have to take care
of my baby

Uncle Rodney admires his work

UNCLE RODNEY
Shes beautiful isnt she

HAZEL
(begging pleading)
Please
Hazel entrenched in a crystal methamphetamine psychotic
episode can only gasp in unintelligible spurts

UNCLE RODNEY
Some people come here too far gone
Like Hazel here The only thing I
can do for her is ease her pain

Hazel rolls her body back and forth on the bed all the

while
keeping her head in Uncle Rodneys lap
HAZEL
Please

UNCLE RODNEY
(to Hazel)
Shhhhh How about a baby one
Uncle Rodneys tenderness in dealing with Hazel calms her
Hes having way too much fun treating her like a baby
HAZEL
Yes
Uncle Rodney takes his pinky and dips it into a small
plastic

bag of powder He then places it to Hazels nostril
She quickly snorts the tiny bit off his finger

UNCLE RODNEY
(to Hazel)
There you go

Hazel begins whimpering again It wasnt nearly enough to
satisfy her

UNCLE RODNEY
Theres something about addiction
that brings out something beautiful
in a person Addiction is pure
Addiction reduces a person to an
infant And theres nothing more
pure and beautiful in the world
than an infant
He puts his finger to Hazels nostril again but this time
without any meth on the tip She snorts with all of her
might then starts crying Uncle Rodney is toying with her

UNCLE RODNEY
Hazel is no longer an adult Shes
an infant and Im the surrogate
mother who provides her with much
needed breast milk Its a role
that both of us have accepted and
embrace

He leans over and grabs a syringe already filled then

gently holds Hazels arm and expertly injects the liquid
into

her vein

Nothing happens for several seconds

Hazels breathing accelerates Suddenly she sits up her
eyes go wide Hazel clinches the bed as if she were riding a
roller coaster

UNCLE RODNEY
(proudly)
Thats my girl

Then she makes eye contact with Jimmy

A curious frightened look comes over her face Clearly
she
recognizes him

She suddenly JUMPS from the bed and runs out of the room

UNCLE RODNEY
Shes a little jumpy

Uncle Rodney smiles amusing himself with his own joke

UNCLE RODNEY
Lets begin shall we And
please Im going to use this
tape for my fans so lets try to
get this right

JIMMY (0C)
hes

OK

UNCLE RODNEY
I apologize if any of this
frightens you or makes you
uncomfortable

JIMMY (0C)
Ill be fine

UNCLE RODNEY
No You wont be fine What Im
going to teach you will be
frightening The truth is an
acquired taste but once you get to
it its all youll ever want

Uncle Rodney starts in on his mantra Its obvious that
well versed in his meandering rant

UNCLE RODNEY
Those kids out there we the so
called undesirables - you and me
we know the truth You know that
society doesnt want you your
parents dont want you corporate
America sure as fuck doesnt want
you You wouldnt be here
otherwise

(MORE)

UNCLE RODNEY (contd)
If this government had a choice
theyd gas us all in a heartbeat
exterminate us like the Jews
enslave us like niggers cuz dont
kid yourself WE ARE the new
niggers in this country No one

respects us No one sees what we
have to offer No one has
compassion for us They dont

care or theyre too naive to see
that were a by-product of a
wasteful society that has failed to
educate embrace influence or
inspire any of us Were societal
garbage The counter culture no
longer exists Its dead Its
been replaced by us--
Long pause

UNCLE RODNEY
The garbage culture thrown
aside imprisoned
institutionalized systematically
abused executed and enlisted into
wars started by government ass-
fuckers just to kill us off JUST
TO KILL US OFF And every week one
of you shows up here
disillusioned addicted angry
pissed cuz they tossed you
aside into the garbage Every
time someone like you shows up here
the garbage culture gets a little
bit stronger and they get a little
bit weaker Until the them and
the they of this country run out
of places to put us to put its
garbage and the garbage OVER-FLOWS
into their cities from out of the
confines of the spaces that they
have set aside for us

A pause then

UNCLE RODNEY
(biblical)
And we will SET FIRE to their
world And we will burn it until
a living HELL REIGNS over what was
their former world and we will
fornicate in their ashes

Rodney stops almost out of breath

UNCLE RODNEY
Thats whats here for you Thats
whats here

Rodney settles himself down and takes a few deep breaths as
Jimmy begins zooming out Uncle Rodney lights a cigarette to

calm himself

Jimmy keeps filming not knowing whether Rodney is finished
lot

of

beat

or just taking a break
Camera shuts down

CAMERA ON
EXT RODNEYS WUNDERLAND - FIRE PIT - NIGHT
Someone (Buddy) is filming a raging party consisting of a
of strung out young white trash junkies just like the ones
Jimmy was interviewing before Its certainly a weird bunch
They all look alike dress similar and have the same type
crystal methamphetamine induced facial expressions
Most of them are smoking weed and drinking forty ounce beers
while dancing around a campfire and playing the bongo drums
They all seem to be having more fun than anyone should be
allowed
Camera pans to Jimmy so we realize that hes not filming
Our best guess would be that its Buddy whos filming Jimmy

screams at the camera over the noise of the Bongo drums

JIMMY
Wheres Judy

Buddys hand comes into frame as he points by the fire pit
We now see Jimmy see Judy

She dances fervently drinking a forty surrounded by tons of
other drunk happily intoxicated teenagers Say what you
might about the attendees to the event this party is a
FUCKING RAGER and Judy is happy to be the center of
everyones attention

Everyone dances faster and faster as the rhythm of drums

faster and become more intense Its an all out jam session

Jimmy heads to the center of the circle of people dancing
around Judy Camera follows him with a zoom as he does

JUMP CUT

Who knows how much later Minutes or hours the party rages
the

in

forward The camera spins around The party has reached a
new level of drunken absurdity Most of those who are
dancing are drunk stoned or both

In the background while its too dark and hectic see
anything explicit some of the teenagers are engaged in a
variety of sexual activity Some have threesomes Some are
probably having oral sex Still others dance around them in
the foreground

Camera zooms in on Uncle Rodney

Standing just behind him we see of flash of someone
recognizable Its a skinny woman she looks vaguely
familiar but its hard to get a fix with all the craziness
going on

She turns her head to look over at Rodney

Now we can clearly see that this person is

HAZEL - with her eyes wide and clearly in the height of
rolling on crank

AND shes saying something to Uncle Rodney thats definitely
pissing him off

Bodies wipe the frame

JUMP CUT

Moments later Camera catches Judy who hasnt missed a step
along the way to being a high drunken mess The rhythm of
the drum beats is ever present

Uncle Rodney comes up behind her and wraps his arms around
her shoulder saying something to her but we cant hear it
over the noise Jimmy approaches and they start talking
Jimmy doesnt notice but there are about four or five of
kids especially a couple of Rodneys Bigger Guys standing
not too far behind Uncle Rodney watching the conversation

intensely

Its really difficult to put your finger on it exactly but
something doesnt seem right here

Uncle Rodney lets go of Judy and puts his arm around Jimmy
With the noise of the drums and the fact that were zoomed

from a distance we cant hear anything theyre saying

Now Uncle Rodney and Jimmy are having a conversation as they
move towards the camera Though Jimmy cant see it we can
see that Rodneys Bigger Guys the ones that were standing
behind Uncle Rodney are now pushing Judy along behind Jimmy
and Rodney Though Uncle Rodney seems to be having a very
light and friendly conversation with Jimmy we continue to
get the feeling that something ominous is afoot

Finally they approach camera and we can hear them

UNCLE RODNEY
Im so glad you guys came down
here We never would have guessed
youd come and see us

JIMMY
Youve been awesome Judy loves it
here

Uncle Rodneys got Jimmy in an incredibly friendly one armed
side hug

UNCLE RODNEY
I knew she would By the way

Rodneys face drops

UNCLE RODNEY
I know what you did to Dinko

This hits Jimmy like a lead weight Before he can react at

all and before he realizes that anything is happening
Jimmy

is suddenly thrown into a headlock by Uncle Rodney

Off camera something similar is happening to Judy

JUDY (0C)
(screaming)
What the fuck are you doing

Judy screams his name over and over

JUDY

Shut it bitch
SMACK Judys been hit by Buddy off screen

Camera shuts down
CAMERA ON
EXT RODNEYS WUNDERLAND - DARK WOODS - NIGHT

We hear intense struggling and laughter By the sounds we
hear we gather that Jimmy and Judy are being dragged off
into the woods against their will by Buddy and Rodneys
Bigger Guys but its too dark to tell if that is what in
fact is happening

Someone unidentified is running the show and operates the
camera Its impossible to see but its definitely Buddys

voice

BUDDY (0C)
Here here here Right here

Judy is screaming and crying

JUDY (OC)

JIMMY (0C)

Jimmy grunts trying to break free

JIMMY

RODNEYS BIG GUY 1 (0C)
Shut up asshole You wanna

MUNCH Somewhere in the darkness Jimmys been kicked in the
gut The camera hits the ground It lands right in front of
Jimmy We can still barely see whats going on but were
close enough and theres enough flashes of light from
flashlights to see that Jimmy is face down and bloody

JIMMY
(defiant)
Fuck you

Jimmy gets kicked again just once Then suddenly a barrage
of kicks come at Jimmy one after the other after the other

Leaves and grass and dirt and flying feet shoot at Jimmys
face as he is kicked and beaten repeatedly

The process goes on for about thirty excruciating seconds
We cant tell how much damage has been sustained but

Jimmys
not moving Hes either unconscious or dead

With one last kick the camera is knocked aside and we dont
see Jimmys face anymore

RODNEYS BIG GUY 1 (0C)
Is he fucking dead

JUDY (OC)
Jimmy Jimmy say something

They mock her in a high pitched wining voice

BUDDY (0C)
(mocking)
Jimmy Jimmy say something

RODNEYS BIG GUY 2 (0C)
Get her clothes off

JUDY (0C)
(screaming)
Noooooo0 Noooooo

Judy screams at the top of her lungs over and over again as
we hear them tearing at her clothes Then they pick her up
and start pulling her away from camera
NIGHT

for

dozens

Her screams get quieter and quieter fainter and fainter

JUDY (0C)
(extremely faint)
Jimmy

Finally theres silence The camera isnt moving Its on
the ground and in the dark Camera shuts down

CAMERA ON

EXT RODNEYS WUNDERLAND - PARKING AREA - DINKOS CAR -

Its completely pitch black dark We can see nothing We
can only hear the sound of Jimmy fumbling around and
breathing heavily and nervously

BEGIN NITE SHOT

Suddenly we see everything albeit in a weird black and
white grainy fashion Jimmys flipped the camera into Nite
Shot using the fuzzy black and white mode as a tool to see
in the complete darkness Hes strapped the camera to his
wrist

The image is Jimmys POV as he searches through his trunk
something Pulling aside a duffle bag we see the 9mm pistol
that Jimmy stole from the Cop He grabs it as camera shuts
down

CAMERA ON
IE RODNEYS WUNDERLAND - FIRE PITOUTSIDE RODNEYS
TRAIERINSIDE RODNEYS TRAILERPARKING AREADINKOS CAR -
NIGHT

By the fire pit the site where the teenage drunken of orgy
took place the bonfire has been put out and there are

of drunkenpassed out teenagers lying on the ground in
sleeping bags and in tents

Jimmy begins looking for Judy with his night vision camera
her
Judys
passed

anyone

JUDY

decides

He sees a girl lying on the ground in a sleeping bag with
back turned to the camera Her hair is identical to

but we cant see her face Jimmy quietly steps over

out teenagers being extremely careful not to awaken

Jimmy accidently kicks a forty ounce beer bottle that causes
a loud clanking sound of glass on glass

Jimmy stops in his tracks in anticipation of someone waking
up No one does

Jimmy continues to walk towards the GIRL WHO LOOKS LIKE

Kneeling directly in front of her Jimmy puts his hands on
her shoulder and pulls the girls front region towards the
camera The girl flips over

Its not Judy And luckily the girl is so severely
intoxicated that she doesnt wake up

Jimmy now makes his way over to a tent He quietly unzips
the mesh entrance and extends his arm out to video tape the
inside Turns out the person in the tent is just another

passed out flunky loser Jimmy quickly takes his arm out of
the tent

Jimmy gives it one last go and continues to look for Judy
among the sea of passed out bodies lying on the ground

No luck
Jimmys not too far from Uncle Rodneys trailer He
to make his way up

He walks using his Nite Shot to see through the sea of
bodies until he gets up to the entrance

OUTSIDE RODNEYS TRAILER

Theres a cracked glass door leaning up against the woodpile
by the entrance Jimmy steps around it turning the lens at

the glass He briefly catches his reflection He looks like
hell warmed over freshly bruised and cut from the recent
beating

Moving forward Jimmy makes it to the front door of Uncle
Rodneys trailer We hear music coming from inside Very
slowly and very carefully Jimmy cracks the front door

INSIDE RODNEYS TRAILER

Its even darker inside of the trailer but Jimmy presses
forward in spite of that fact still using his Nite Shot to
see A boom box sits by the bed still on playing music

Jimmy is scared shitless

In the corner of the room in a make shift bunk is Uncle
Rodney sleeping with his arms wrapped around a girl ina
spooning position Theres no doubt this time

Its definitely JUDY

They are both sound asleep and actually look very cozy lying
together Jimmy slowly walks over towards them Each step
is slower and slower being extra careful not to wake them

Once Jimmy is within arms length of the two of them he
stops He hesitates for a moment He hasnt prepared
himself for this particular situation and doesnt know
exactly what to do

He continues filming them until he finally musters the
courage to extend his non-filming arm out to tap Judy on the
face Judy remains unconscioussleeping as Jimmy gently taps
the side of her cheek Jimmy slowly begins tapping harder
and harder until the tap evolves into a poke Still nothing

THWACK An arm comes out of nowhere and grabs Jimmys poking
hand Jimmy has woken up Uncle Rodney

The camera shakes out of control Uncle Rodney screams at
the top of his lungs

UNCLE RODNEY
Who the fuck

Intense and furious wrestling ensues as Uncle Rodney flies
the

out of frame then in a split second
BAM

A gunshot goes off We hear a Uncle Rodney collapse
followed by more gun shots The camera has fallen from
Jimmys hand and dangles by the wrist strap Camera comes to
rest on

UNCLE RODNEYS BLOODY FACE

Jimmys shot and killed him

Outside footsteps hit the deck Buddy opens the door of
trailer

BUDDY
Hey

BAM BAM BAM

Three more rounds are fired hitting Buddy square in the
chest knocking him down Jimmy points the camera at a dead
Buddy on his back then whip pans it back to Judy in the bed
Finally we hear Jimmy speak

JIMMY (0C)
Judy Judy wake up Fucking wake
up

Outside we hear voices of some of Rodneys Other Teens
Jimmy acts fast Judy has been drugged and is mostly
unconscious and groggy but Jimmy picks her up and gets her
on her feet shouldering her out the door Shot continues
to

OUTSIDE RODNEYS TRAILER

We hear faint voices

RODNEYS BIG GUY 3
(faint)

A DISTANT GUNSHOT FIRES but we cant see what is going on

Its too dark and the camera is too shaky as they go to
PARKING AREA

Another DISTANT SHOT then Jimmy gasps in pain Hes been
shot but decides to run trying to carry a groggy Judy
anyway Their car is in sight as we hear guns going off and
bullets whizzing by them One hits Dinkos car

Jimmy opens the door then places the passed out Judy and

camera in the passenger seat climbs over her throwing the
camera into Judys lap

We see him scramble to get the key in the ignition as we

a BULLET HIT the drivers door The car starts and Jimmy
throws it into gear flooring the gas as he speeds away

JIMMY

Jimmys voice begins to crack as he talks totries to wake

camera to the floor as camera shuts down

Judy points the camera up at Jimmy This is the first time
weve seen him at all since he was beaten up by Uncle
Rodneys group Hes a wreck His face is puffy His lip
is cut up His eye is swollen He looks like a flyweight
boxer who just went fifteen rounds with a heavyweight

He drives with one arm because the other one is ina
JUDY (0C)
Hey baby

Jimmy looks like a beaten man both physically and
emotionally His bad ass attitude and rebellious charisma
are seemingly non-existent

For the first time we are seeing Jimmy without his armor
He looks like any other 21 year old kid who is down
vulnerable and confused Not to mention the fact that he
has a fucking bullet lodged in his shoulder

JUDY (0C)
Baby
JIMMY

Judy comes back into the passenger seat and just films him
She likes looking at him through the lens

Then his eyes get droopy and close

Hes not responding Hes as punch drunk as you can get

Judy looks up into the rearview mirror Her eyes are welling
up She looks out the front windshield

around through the front only to see a row of cop cars

blocking the highway up ahead

He flips the camera back at her
JIMMY (0C)

windshield Theyre stuck The road has come to a dead end

tries to turn it around and head back the way she came

They head straight in between two cars that form the
roadblock Cops jump out of the way as the car hits head on
into
THE ROADBLOCK
Impact sends the camera flying against the windshield
CRACKING IT

Sounds of metal twisting and glass shattering is all
encompassing as the camera shakes in a violent frenzy

Camera settles on Judys face bloody unconscious against
as

the steering wheel her neck snapped eyes open in a death
stare

Camera stays focussed on Judy for the longest time as she
leans against the steering wheel Music plays on the radio
Its JOHNNY CASHs cover of Tom Pettys I wont Back Down

scene

Looking down from above we see what the helicopter sees

A scene of about twelve State Trooper cars lights flashing
with Jimmy and Judys car wrecked Ambulances are there
Jimmy and Judys lifeless bodies are pulled from their car

Johnny Cashs song shifts from background to score

The helicopter continues its circular pattern as the song
continues and we
