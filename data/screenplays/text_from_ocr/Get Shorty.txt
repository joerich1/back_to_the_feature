As we BOOM DOWN from a massive billboard for the movie Bonaparte starring Martin Weir as
Napoleon and begin tracking with Harrys eight-year-old battered Mercedes

INT HARRYS CAR -- SAME TIME

Harry drives all the while gesturing with a lit cigarette

HARRY

These guys my investors they run a limo service came to me originally put money in a few of my
pictures and did okay theyre happy So they come in on another deal -- this was back a few months ago

Harry looks at him Chili takes away his cigarette

CHILI
Youre trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid and thats hard to do Lets just get to
where youre at okay You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball
game and you havent told em about it Why not

HARRY

Because theyre not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint The first
thing theyd do is break my legs

CHILI

You got that on the brain Harry If youre so scared of em whyd you take their money to Vegas to begin
with

HARRY

Because I need half a million to buy a script
CHILI

For a movie

HARRY

Anyway Murray has this shrink who also happens to be Martins personal trainers shrink Murray gives
the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martins trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out

and Martin flips Loves it

weeks ago Murray never made it back

Chili nods looks up at an ANGELYNE billboard
HARRY

Doris Murrays widow finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any
written contract she wants five hundred grand for the script

CHILI

So youre thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner Ask him if he wants to invest his
money in a movie

HARRY

A BIG MAN bearded wearing a loud Hawaiian shirt and carrying a three-year-old GIRL in his arms
The girl licks an ice-cream spilling some on Daddys shirt

Bo Catlett looks over as disembarking PASSENGERS start coming through the gate
As a LATINO MAN gets off the plane and glances around He looks uncomfortable in the loose-fitting
suit like a migrant dressed for Saturday night

The Latino Man lays his TICKET ENVELOPE on top of the trash container near the gateway

steps in reaches over the desk and picks up a script

HARRY

RONNIE

Bo Catlett eyes him a beat then pushes out of his chair

on the back

HARRY

(to the director)

HARRY

Shes scared Fear is an emotion

Look kid if you remember anything from your time working with Harry Zimm let it be the three key
words to filmmaking

Pick n Save over on Vine to buy a lousy candybar for my dinner

Chili watches the crew stop what theyre doing and listen
HARRY

Im standing in line waiting to pay my two bits when I overhear this lady call her Mildred talking to the
cashier about a movie

The Director gives a look to his assistant like Jesus you believe this shit’

HARRY

So Mildred says to the cashier I saw the new Streisand picture

(gets into it the way Mildred did)

God I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redfords hair off his forehead the way she did
when they were together and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other
but knew they couldnt be together That look was so romantic

DIRECTOR

Thats great Harry So whats the --

HARRY

What she did not say was I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin’
seasick All she cared about was that look All she remembered was that look And why do we remember
things in movies Because we can see them

Harrys right in the guys face now

HARRY

(touches the side of his head)

and I tell him Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin dead Like that
BO CATLETT

I wonder would that work

(then)

You know who I see for Al Roxy Harvey Keitel The man could do it in his sleep
CHILI

Harvey Keitel Yeah Maybe He was pretty good in the movie Fingers

BO CATLETT
I missed that one Or hey you know who else Morgan Freeman You know Morgan
CHILI

Yeah Morgan Freeman But hes a colored guy

BO CATLETT

So what Wheres it say in this script hes white Color is what the part needs man somebody to do it has
some style The way it is now Ronnie could do it play himself some cracked out asshole

(then)

So whatta you think of the script

Bo watches as Chili picks up a copy of the script begins flipping through it
CHILI

Titles the first things got to go And the guys name I mean even this writers name Murray Saffrin is
better than Lovejoy

BO CATLETT

Im with you on that And dont you think it needs a good female part Increase the romance angle
Chili flips through the script sees aname
CHILI

Theres Ilona

BO CATLETT

What about her

CHILI

Get something going there

BO CATLETT

With Ilona You know how old Ilona is
CHILI

Shes young
BO CATLETT

Young Shes fuckin’ nine-years-old same age as Lovejoys kid Bernie One she calls Bernard Have you
read the script

CHILI

BO CATLETT

Who

CHILI

Shes been out of movies a few years but shes good Real good

Bo Catlett studies Chili a moment smiles

BO CATLETT

You know what Im thinkin

(leans forward)

You wanna make the girl older I dont like the ending We could do that you and me sit down and write
the script over where it needs it

Chili fips through the script a moment

CHILI

You know how to write one of these

BO CATLETT

Theres nothin to know You have an idea you write down what you wanna say Then you get somebody
to add in the commas and shit where they belong if you arent positive yourself Maybe fix up the
spelling where you have some tricky words although Ive seen scripts where I know words werent
spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all So I dont think its too important Anyway you
come to the last page you write in Fade out and thats the end youre done

CHILI

Thats all there is to it huh

BO CATLETT
Thats all

Chili sits forward stabs out his cigarette exhales into Bo Catletts face
CHILI

Bo Catlett starts for the door

with Marlene Dietrich

MARLENE DIETRICH (OS)

CHILI
So youre a stuntman Are you any good

The Bear grins and turns his head to the side as if too modest to answer and will let Bo Catlett speak for
him

This makes the next move easier the guy not even looking as Chili grabs a handful of his crotch steps
aside and yanks him off the fucking stairs

The Bear yells out of pain and fear as the beefy guy rolls all the way down the stairs to land on the main
floor a few feet away from where Karen now stands

Chili keeps watching until he sees the guy move then looks up at Bo Catlett whos now coming down
CHILI

Not bad for a guy his size

Chili continues up the stairs to where Bo Catlett stands beside the table Chili unbuttons his coat

the middle

He looks both ways takes his time until a group of people pass behind giving him a screen giving him
just time enough to open C-17 grab the black athletic bag and close the locker

BEAR

Chili shakes his head tired of this but still feeling a little sorry for the guy He looks off in a kind of
thoughtful way turns to the Bear again and kicks him in the left knee hard

The Bear stumbles hunching over Chili grabs him by the hair with both hands pulls his head down and
brings his own knee up into the guys face This straightens him and now Chili hits him high in the belly

as hard as he can right under the rib cage

The Bear sucks air with his mouth open trying to breathe helpless now and in pain Chili takes him by the
arm

CHILI
Lie down on your back Come on if you want to breathe

He gets the Bear down on the concrete straddles his midsection and reaches down to lift him up by the
waist of his pants

CHILI

Take deep breaths through your mouth and let it out slow thats it like that

The Bear starts to breathe okay again He checks his teeth now feeling his nose

CHILI

Hey Bear look at me

The Bear looks at him

Chili watches Harry try to shake a cigarette out of the pack Chili reaches over and helps him out
CHILI

Tell me Harry whatd you think of Ray Bones as a person

Harry goes stiff looks at Chili as he lights one for himself

CHILI

Only a guy like Bones would mess you up like this break your hands for no reason He shoot Ronnie
too

Harry looks at Karen quickly looks away
CHILI

Thing I dont get Harry is whyd you go and do a thing like talking to Ray Bones You dont need guys
like him or Bo Catlett

Harry looks at Chili now
CHILI

I been here a while now and far as I can tell youre the only person in town actually making a movie

broken hands

MARTIN

So Harry I hear you had quite an experience

Harry grunts

MARTIN

Birthday Boy Had I gotten the part I mightve gotten typecast
Martin smiles at his own joke looks up as the Maitre D approaches Harry turns back to Chili and Karen
MARTIN

shallots only slightly browned

Karen and Chili exchange looks pick up their menus

DISSOLVE TO

INT THE IVY -- DAY

Theyve finished lunch Chili shares a bowl of ice cream with Karen Harry sips cognac through one of
those tiny cocktail straws

MARTIN

I think the romance angle in your story is critically important that isnt simply a jump in the sack for
either of them These two become deeply in love

Harry looks up mumbles through his wired jaw
HARRY

Which two

MARTIN

(ignoring him)

Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them it not only heightens the
tension it adds a wistful element to their love

HARRY
Mob guy
Harry touches his jaw It hurts to speak

MARTIN
I have to consider I mean as the mob guy this is another mans wife Im sleeping with
KAREN

And after all you have such morals

Harry looks to Karen for help here

HARRY

Mob guy

Martin looks at his watch

MARTIN

Ihave to run But what I hope to see they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money It becomes
their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it but in the end they cant Can they

HARRY

What money

MARTIN

(bewildered)

The three hundred large What other money is there
(then)

I should keep quiet I know till Ive read the script but Ive got a feeling about this one Im that shylock
HARRY
