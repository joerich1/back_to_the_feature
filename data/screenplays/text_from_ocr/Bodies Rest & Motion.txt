SOUND
Sids truck engine roars to life
NICKS POV
Sid peels out driving up onto the lawn past Nick and
Carols

cars out onto the street and out of sight
THE DOORWAY

Carol steps into the doorway beside Nick
CAROL
So
(dryly)
Start painting

Nick looks back into the room

NICK
(after a beat)
Fuck the ceiling
(walking in)
Who looks up that often

Carol follows him into the room Nick slumps on the
sofa
staring at the blank tv

MANS VOICE
(happily)
This is it

A MAN and a WOMAN both slightly portly Mexican-
Americans in

their late forties wearing their Sunday best step
over the

threshold and kiss

The man is carrying the woman cradled in his arms

CAROL
(politely)
Hello

MAN
(surprised breaking
the kiss)
Oh Hello

The four stare at each other in awkward silence the
woman
still cradled in the mans arms

MAN

to be empty

NICK
(flatly)

WOMAN
(cheerfully)

The man puts her down on her feet

WOMAN

back to the couple
NICK
(improvising)

door
Carol throws him a look
MAN

(putting on a good
face)

He holds out his hand to shake After an instant of
awkward

hesitation they all shake hands with too much
enthusiasm

WOMAN
(cheerfully while
shaking hands)

It is and its so nice of you to
greet us
CAROL
Thank you
They finish the handshakes -- theres an awkward pause
NICK

He waits half expecting this statement to be
challenged It

NICK

(confidently)
The people who left here -- our old
neighbors -- left us that tv

They all look at the tv

CAROL

Nick looks to make eye contact with Carol He cant

Shes
looking back over her shoulder for obstacles He smiles
and
glances toward the couple

puzzled

NICK
He was very tall He was too tall to

overcoat and I thought its a
trick hes on my mothers shoulders

He smiles at the memory

NICK
And then out from behind him came
this beautiful young girl Beth

CUT TO
EXT SIDS TRUCK - NIGHT
Through the windshield we see Sid driving slowly

looking
out at motel parking lots Their neon signs reflect in

the

windshield

EXT STRIP OFF THE HIGHWAY

Gas stations fast food joints and motels

Sid and his truck pull away from the strip and up onto
the

on ramp

EXT HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS
Sid and his truck pull onto the highway
CREDITS ROLL
As Sids taillights disappear down the barren highway

FADE
OUT

THE END
