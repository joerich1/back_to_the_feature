this is There is a one-in-so-and-
so chance this will happenGod
protect me I am powerless let it
not happen to me But no to that
I say Theres something else
What is it If it happens AS IT
MAY for that is not within our
powers I will deal with it just

as I do today with what draws my
concern today I say this is how
we must act I do those things
which seem correct to me today I
trust myself And if security
concerns me I do that which today
I think will make me secure And
every day I do that when that day
arrives that I need a reserve a
odds are that I have it and b
the true reserve that I have is the
strength that I have of acting each
day without fear

According to the dictates of my
mind

Stocks bonds objects of art real
