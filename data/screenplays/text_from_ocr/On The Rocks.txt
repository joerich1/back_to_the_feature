way that makes sense

They sit in a corner of the dark room

The WAITRESS gives them menus and Felix gives her a charming
smile

FELIX
Thank you

He watches the waitress walk away checking her out

FELIX (CONTD)
You know it’s interesting when
humans walked on all fours it was
the sight of a woman’s rear end
that excited them and so when
they stood up on two legs the
women with rounded breasts that
looked like buttocks excited the
males so they had babies with
those females and over time this
shape evolved into the modern
human female

Pink 25A

Laura’s heard this before

Blue 26

LAURA
Oh huh really

Felix continues to impart more wisdom

FELIX

Yes and men preferred the
adolescent females as they were
easier to catch and ultimately
mate with so slowly these
qualities smaller size smooth
skin no beard high voices
evolved into what is desirable

today

LAURA
They preferred no beard -- good
to know

Felix is oblivious to her irony
The waitress returns Felix looks at the way she’s standing

FELIX
Ballet dancer

She looks down at her feet turned out
WAITRESS

Bolshoi

Thank you

FELIX

LAURA

FELIX
How’s writing

LAURA
I haven’t had time to get much

FELIX

LAURA
Maybe ones that aren’t mothers of

FELIX

short fiction in between raising
three children

LAURA

Laura struggles to answer repeating bits of what she’s heard

Pink 29

LAURA

Laura hesitates then says

LAURA (CONTD)
I did find something

toiletries in his suitcase --

FELIX
Sloppy move

LAURA

couldn’t take them through
security in her carry on so he
put them in his checked luggage

Have you checked his phone

He winces at

The waitress

Blue LAURA
What -- no
FELIX
Look do me a favor -- just check

his text messages I’m sure it’s
nothing but you just want to make
sure

LAURA
Dean’s not like you He’s a nerd
a good guy a great dad

the slight

FELIX
Look I know but he’s a man --
it’s nature The males fight to
dominate and get all the females

LAURA
But do you believe in true love

FELIX
Yes I do it’s an enchanted
state but it’s God’s trick to
make babies I remember the
first time I saw your mother -- we
were at a pool party out at the

If you work with someone you’re
in contact unless he erased them

Laura wonders about this more concerned

FELIX (CONTD)
when did he start acting
strange

LAURA
(trying to be logical)
He’s been distracted since he
started this new company and
working with Fiona

FELIX
Who’s Fiona The toiletries gal

Laura starts to give in to her insecurities

LAURA
His tall business associate

FELIX
Hmmm

Felix pulls out a little notebook from his pocket and jots a

note
They pass the Plaza Hotel

FELIX (CONTD)
You know the best place to have
an affair is the Plaza -- it has
the most exits

Blue 49

LAURA
(ironic)
Great to know

MUSTO
I can see that there isn’t
another one like it with exits on
three streets

Laura looks like -- ‘What has my life become’

LAURA
Can any man be monogamous

FELIX
Monogamy and marriage are built on
the concept of property it only
came about in human history
because when man began to obtain
land for agriculture he had to
decide who would inherit his
property

MUSTO
I’ve been married for twenty
years

LAURA
See

FELIX
You know what my friend Tony
always says -- “Women You can’t
live with them you can’t live
without them But that doesn’t
mean you have to live with them”

a de Kooning woman
She puts the watch on with appreciation

LAURA
Thank you I love it

older I don’t have a lot but
Id like to know what things of
mine you and your sister might

LAURA
Oh come on you’re not that old
I’m sure well have the pleasure
of your company a little longer

He smiles
The waiter takes their order
Felix looks at Laura taking her in

FELIX
You know I remember the moment
when I first recognized you as a
person We were in the country
and you were about 9 months old
happily sitting in the dirt
(MORE )

Blue 51

FELIX (CONTD)
and I reached out and picked you
up your diaper was sagging from a
muddy puddle and we looked at

recognized who you were and what
you were going to become

Laura smiles

LAURA
And here we are

The waiter brings dishes
FELIX
So What’s the plan I was

thinking we need to follow him

LAURA
What Dean--really

FELIX
No Let’s just see what he’s up
to

LAURA

No it’s fine

FELIX
Laura -- it’s better to know I’m
sure it’s nothing but better to
be sure
LAURA
(reluctantly)

He has a work dinner Friday

FELIX
Perfect I’1l switch cars and
well tail him

LAURA
Could you act a little less
excited This is my life that
could be falling apart

Blue 52

FELIX
I’m not worried about you kiddo
You have beauty brains and good
character -- the most important
quality in a person Do you know
a woman is at her most beautiful
between 35 and 39

LAURA
Great I have 2 years left

FELIX
Women of all ages are beautiful
They are like flowers even a
dried flower is beautiful but in
a different way

She looks at him
FELIX (CONTD)
I don’t know why women get plastic

surgery

LAURA
Because of men like you

FELIX
(offended
Hey I appreciate women of many
ages
LAURA

I’m sure you do
She laughs
He gives her a little smile
FELIX

Let’s get to the bottom of things
so you’re not driven crazy

LAURA
Maybe he’s just having some mid-
life boredom I’m not the

conquest anymore

FELIX
It’s true that relationships go
through many phases and
familiarity can breed boredom

Blue 53

He orders an ice cream sundae

LAURA
Can a man want what he already
has

FELIX

There’s a beautiful story about
that by Irwin Shaw I think
called “Women in their Summer
Dresses” It’s the story of a
man who’s waiting for his wife
He’s thinking about how it’s
Spring and all the women are in
their summer dresses and the
smell of flowers and sunlight and
the sight of the women and the
rush it gives him but he got
married and at one point a
woman in her summer dress appears
and he looks at her and lights up
and realizes it’s his wife coming
to meet him it’s beautiful
But that’s what men are like

It’s all an illusion but you can
have that with your wife too

LAURA
If you keep up the illusion Do
you think most people hit a wall
and walk away

FELIX
I think some do

LAURA
Or like Mom they have to

FELIX
Well thats a whole other story
she had her limitations

LAURA
I think you could drive anyone to
limitations
He gives her a look

The ice cream sundae arrives- Felix motions it’s for her

Pink 54

LAURA (CONTD)
Thanks

FELIX
Look I think it’s important to
give each other privacy But if
he’s being dishonorable you
should know And it’s better to
find out on your own terms so you
can be prepared if it is anything
Which it is very possibly not
I’1l pick you up Friday and we’1ll
follow him Let’s see what we
see

LAURA
(mouth full of whipped
cream)

No

Soho House

FELIX
I still don’t understand why
anyone would want to go there
with all the great clubs in New
York Not only the Sentinel --
have you ever been to the
Architectural League Now that’s
a place to go and The
Knickerbocker they have great
readings

Felix shakes his head

to me He said Dean went to J
Sheekey’s -- had a four top
reserved which is always a good
cover

FELIX
A possibility

They wait He demonstrates and makes her practice
whistling

Blue 60

Until they see Dean Fiona and a few men in trendy suits
enter the building

Laura sees Dean open the door for Fiona who’s laughing and
touches his arm in a familiar way

Felix slumps down to not be seen pulling Laura down

FELIX (CONTD)
Is that her the leggy brunette

LAURA
Yeah that’s Fiona

FELIX
I see did I ever tell you about

Laura looks at him -- it never ends

I’m sure you did

CUT TO

LATER

Laura looks at the clock 1005

They’ve been waiting awhile she has Felix’s scarf around her
neck

They eat some crackers with caviar
Laura is stressed but Felix is oblivious

FELIX
Did you know the Russians fed the
cosmonauts Beluga High protein
and then their waste was just a
little touch of ash

LAURA
(distracted)
Really
FELIX

We can call this caviar but the
Beluga’s all gone

Blue 61

He is forlorn

FELIX (CONTD)
This stuff from Canada’s pretty
good

Felix checks the Soho House entrance

LAURA
Why can’t men be satisfied with
one woman

FELIX
It’s nature keeping the --
species alive

She’s heard this all before

FELIX (CONTD)
You know the human male is very
stimulated by an image

LAURA
Yeah

Where is he going with this

FELIX
Why Because if a man saw a
pretty woman over the hill and he
saw her ankle he would be
motivated to go over that hill to
get her They were less attracted
to their cousins and the girls in
their village which is better for
genetics

LAURA
And it’s more of a conquest and a
challenge than the girl who is
sitting right next to you

She sighs to herself

FELIX
It’s direct wiring The male is
turned on by the image whereas
the woman goes through an
emotional filter

(MORE)

Blue FELIX (CONTD)
The male doesn’t go through the
emotional part It goes right
from the eyes to the ass

Laura tries to follow his logic

Felix notices something and takes out his binoculars

FELIX (CONTD)
Is that them

-- but it’s a false alarm

LAURA
What makes a woman desirable or
sexy to a man

FELIX
Hmmm that she knows she is A
woman who is confident in the
effects she has on you -- that’s
sexy

LAURA
Do you think if a woman loves you
it’s a turnoff for a man

FELIX
Most people are very insecure and
don’t think highly of themselves
so if a woman loves you she must
have something wrong with her to
love someone as awful as you Or
you know in the words of Groucho -
- “I wouldn’t want to join any
club that would have me as a
member”

LAURA
Do you think men are just more
interested in the unpredictable

He thinks about it
FELIX
The Corsican wanted me to pull her

hair but that wasn’t for me

LAURA
The Corsican

Blue 63

FELIX

Did you ever hear the saying --
pardon my language -- the fucking
you get is not worth the fucking
you get

No

They speed along as the Alfa Romeo revs spits and backfires
Felix howls with the thrill

Laura mortified with herself looks over at him

The car suddenly stalls -- Felix wiggles some wiring throws

the clutch and gets it running again They take off down the

Laura looks at him like it’s useless

They slip into a booth

LAURA
I can’t believe I’m here

FELIX
It’s beautiful isn’t it

LAURA
It is

Felix looks at the menu

Blue FELIX
Do you know there’s a cult in
Canada of women who kidnap men and
when they try to escape or get
aggressive -- they placate them
with sex

LAURA
What What are you talking about

(She’s less and less amused)

FELIX
It’s real I know someone it
happened to

LAURA
Sounds like your fantasy

FELIX
It’s not unlike the Bonobos -- do
you know what they are

LAURA
The monkeys

FELIX
Yes they’re the only mammals
where the females dominate the
males -- so when the males in the
tribe get hostile or aggressive
the females have sex with them to
keep them docile

Laura looks at him

A WAITER comes for their order

WAITER
Good evening what can I get you

FELIX
Well have two martinis

Two martinis

“vodka martini” or if you must a
Vodkatini is made with vodka

LAURA
Not everyone knows that

FELIX
Well they should

Martinis arrive
Felix takes a sip

FELIX (CONTD)
Why is it that when a woman has an
affair they say “Isn’t that nice
she met someone” but when a man
has an affair it’s “He’s banging
the secretary”

Laura looks at him

LAURA
Why do so many men have affairs
anyway besides all your nature
theories what’s the real reason

FELIX

When your mother and I were first
together she shone all of her
light on me And then you and
your sister came along and that
light all went to you so I was
drawn to it when a woman looked at
me like that I wanted to be in
that glow again

LAURA
You’re such a baby

Blue 83

FELIX
We just want to be loved

LAURA
It’s exhausting

FELIX
Your mother was interested in her
own things her friends when I
met Holly she was so crazy in
love with me I wasn’t used to it

Laura is surprised he brought her up

LAURA
That was the appeal looking at
you with such adoration

FELIX
Yeah and your mom didn’t want
to travel with me she suggested I
take Holly who had started at the
gallery do you know she died
last year

LAURA
No

FELIX
I never thought I’d outlive her
She was only fifty-seven

Felix has never talked about her before with Laura

LAURA
I don’t remember her that well
but she didn’t seem to stand out
I wouldn’t have expected her

FELIX
She was funny

LAURA
And smart

FELIX
She was and she was a really
good painter I never got to say
goodbye to her

Blue 84

Laura realizes how much she meant to him as it brings up old
feelings for her

LAURA
Was is it worth it

FELIX
What

LAURA
Everything you put us through
What it did to mom And then you
didn’t even stay with her

FELIX
It was heartbreaking

Laura’s never heard him talk about it before

EXT RESORT - NIGHT

We FOLLOW Felix and Laura down a path in the dark They pass
an illuminated palm tree here and there

He’s wearing a safari jacket or vest with pockets and Zeiss
binoculars around his neck

FELIX
(stealthily)
C’mon over here

LAURA
This is a new low

They get to a low wall that separates their resort from the
neighboring one Felix tries to casually vault it but it’s a
little too high and he bangs his knee He hands her his
binoculars and some other supplies including water bottles
and settles for climbing over it awkwardly He beckons for
Laura to climb over too

She hands the gear and her cell phone to him and hops over as
a light shines

FELIX
Oops Get down

LAURA

Blue 85

FELIX
Never mind Too late Get up

Felix has spotted a resort SECURITY GUARD coming down the
path towards them on a golf cart Felix pulls Laura into an
embrace

FELIX (CONTD)

gives him a thumbs-up Then drives on

Felix is on lookout -- He’s talking to Laura while he scans
the area through his binoculars

FELIX
I never saw the point of the
infinity pool It’s like
where’s the edge They always make
me afraid I’m going to fall into a
canyon or something

Felix looks over to see Laura has fallen asleep on a rock
ledge

He puts a towel over her She’s sleeping peacefully and he
admires her sweet face -- like when she was a kid

Blue 86

He sees a lounge chair nearby and leans down to pick her up
It’s awkward and he kinks his back

Laura’s eyes startle open

LAURA
What are you doing

FELIX
Nothing

LAURA
Were you trying to pick me up

FELIX
You fell asleep do you know how
Many times I picked you up and
carried you to bed when you were
little

LAURA

He winces and braces his back

FELIX
Tell me about it

LAURA

Felix looks through his binoculars

Blue 87

LAURA

FELIX
There’s a woman in his room

Laura’s heart sinks She looks and sees the outline of a
female figure in the window

LAURA
Are you sure

She grabs the binoculars -- the strap of which are still
around Felix’s neck The binocular strap has yanked Felix’s
body into an uncomfortable contortion but he just tolerates
it

Her POV Through the lens The woman in silhouette closes
the curtains

She gives Felix the binoculars back as she heads off down
towards the room

FELIX
Hey what are you doing Come
back here

She ignores him determined

Laura crosses to the patio outside the sliding glass doors to
Fiona’s room She peeks around a side wall watching the
silhouettes inside through the sheer curtains Felix has
caught up with her and is also peeking around the corner
over her shoulder

FELIX (CONTD)
Let’s go This is a bad idea

LAURA
This was your idea

FELIX
Well they can’t all be winners
Come on

Suddenly a CELLPHONE starts ringing

LAURA
Shh Silence it

Blue 88

FELIX

LAURA
Your phone

FELIX
I don’t have a phone

LAURA
Oh shit

She starts patting her pockets

LAURA (CONTD)
It’s my phone Where is it

FELIX
Oh right I think I have it

Felix pats his pockets finding it He tries to silence it
but he’s not familiar with the buttons so it just keeps
ringing as he feels around for the tiny button

LAURA
Just give it to me

FELIX
I know how to work a cellphone
Just stop grabbing

Laura reaches for it Felix jerks it out of her reach and it
flies out of his hand -- landing with a loud THUNK on the
glass table on the patio Laura goes to retrieve it trying
to stay low -- but the patio lights come on and the sliding
glass door opens -- it’s Fiona with a margarita in her hand

FIONA
Oh my god--Laura

LAURA

LAURA (CONTD)

And no one goes deaf to just the
frequency of women’s voices You
have daughters and granddaughters
so you better start being able to
hear them You already drove Mom
away do you want to drive us all
away

He looks at her

LAURA (CONTD)
Being your daughter it’s
surprising I can be with anyone
Especially someone who might be
respectful You weren’t even
discreet You could have been a
little discreet out of respect for
Mom And for me -- do you know
what it was like having to keep
your secrets And enough with
your theories -- you are not an
animal with no control over your
behavior

She starts to leave

LAURA (CONTD)

And can you be around a woman at
all without hitting on her It’s
starting to get pathetic

Felix stares at her like ‘are you done’

CUT TO

EXT SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

It’s the last day of school An ice cream truck is there
Maya and Theo run screaming towards Laura and Dean

CUT TO

from each other eye to eye

She smiles

He hands her a gift box with a ribbon She opens it and
looks at it -- a Thermomix attachment

It’s too light She opens the box and a small red Cartier
box falls out She looks at him with a smile

She opens it to see a classic watch
DEAN (CONTD)
Sorry I didn’t realize how long

it took to engrave

LAURA
Oh

She turns it over to look at with a smile to herself

LAURA (CONTD)
Thank you

She takes off Felix’s watch putting it carefully in the box
She puts on her new watch

A waiter brings a cake with sparklers

Laura and Dean look across at each other over the sparks

She leans toward him
