TITLE MARCH 1862 KERNSTOWN

A UNION FORCE UNDER JAMES SHIELDS HAS DEFEATED
OLD BLUE LIGHT AKA STONEWALL JACKSON
TONIGHT OLD BLUE LIGHT COUNTERATTACKS

MATTE PAINTING 5000 campfires signal the presence of
the Army of the Potomac The air is damp and the fires
smoulder

SHEET LIGHTNING flickers briefly illuminating drawn-up
wagons and artillery and the thick forests of the
Shenendoah Mountains beyond

UNION ENCAMPMENT EXT DUSK

COLONEL WW BELKNAP rides a white horse through the camp
CAPTAIN BIERCE is at his side

BELKNAP is 24 years old straight-backed with a mane of
yellow hair Spare almost frail-looking clean-shaven
save for sideburns at the curve of his jaws he is
correctly dressed in every detail

BIERCE is almost 50 and bespectacled He has a rubber
ponchothrown over his uniform and rides a plain dun horse

BELKNAP surveys the MEN of the 6th Illinois Volunteers
trooping into camp Their feet sink into the churned-up
MUD They are exhausted Their weapons are slung over
their shoulders or carried in their hands

BELKNAP
The Army is cowardly tonight

BIERCE
The Army is WET tonight Colonel Belknap
Wet and cold And yes it doesnt want

to end up like that --

He indicates a corpse lying in a pool of yellow water
Its face and clothing are covered with mud Several
wagons have rolled over it

BELKNAP
Disgraceful
(calls to two passing MEN)
You You

The MEN turn and look up at BELKNAP on his horse
Belatedly they salute BELKNAP points to the body

BELKNAP
Get rid of that immediately

The MEN are tired and emaciated They stare at the corpse
There are corpses everywhere

BIERCE
Do as the Colonel says

The SOLDIERS stack their muskets and approach the body
BELKNAP and BIERCE ride on

AHEAD OF THEM a group of men is being herded by PRIVATES
with fixed bayonets These MEN are exceptionally wretched-
looking Some are oddly-uniformed still clad in early
Union grey or gaudy clothing patterned after French
zouaves

BELKNAP reins his horse and addresses the SERGEANT IN
CHARGE

BELKNAP
Why are these men under guard

SERGEANT
Deserters sir

BELKNAPs fine-featured face hardens
He gazes at each man in turn

THUNDER RUMBLES
BELKNAP
Nothing is more loathsome than the
sight of those who have besmirched
their colors on the field of honor
(he looks at BIERCE
BIERCE remains silent)
Shoot the lot

SERGEANT
Begging the Colonels pardon but
Im under orders from Captain Peabody
to conduct these men behind the lines

BELKNAP
(his face growing red)
So they can escape again Do as I say
Form a firing party NOW

SERGEANT
(saluting)
Yes SIR

The SERGEANT marches over to the SUTLERS WAGON where a
group of VOLUNTEERS is lined up to buy booze Most are
still clad in civilian clothes

Above the wagon are signs saying NO LIKER SERVED TO SOLJERS
and US HOTEL DGRUB

SERGEANT
You five men Form a firing line

On the double

The chosen five grumbling fall in Some of them seem to
be quite drunk THUNDER

ANGLE ON THE DESERTERS
Watching in abject terror Among them is a private in his
mid 20s - good-looking in a weasally way His face is

scarred by Measles spots His name is JAMES D WOOL

Beside him a terrified DESERTER falls to his knees
DESERTER
Have pity Colonel sir They told
us wed be back home in a month
I have a farm to tend sir And a wife

BELKNAP turns his back on the sobbing man

WOOL catches the eye of a member of the FIRING SQUAD
A tough black man in his thirties He wears a SILVER
EARRING ISHMAEL GOULDING MORE THUNDER closer now

The first three DESERTERS are lined up before the squad
The MAN who begged for mercy is among them

ANGLE ON COLONEL BELKNAP AND CAPTAIN BIERCE

BIERCE
Strictly speaking Colonel you dont
have the authority to execute these
fellows villains though they be
The proper remedy is placarding or
tying behind a wagon --

BELKNAP
Do you propose to report me Captain Bierce

BIERCE
No sir I do not

The SERGEANT looks at COLONEL BELKNAP COLONEL BELKNAP
nods

SERGEANT
Firing squad - present arms - fire

A VOLLEY OF SHOTS SIMULTANEOUS LIGHTNING
The three DESERTERS fall dead in the mud

BELKNAP
And the next group Sergeant
As quickly as you can
WOOL is stood between two others facing the FIRING SQUAD
Again he makes eye contact with GOULDING GOULDING winks
at him

The FIRING SQUAD take aim with their Sharps rifles

A HERD OF DEER runs through the Camp
There is a whistling sound

The MEN turn to watch the deer - and a CANNISTER OF GRAPE
AND EXPLOSIVE hits the Sutlers Wagon - blasting it apart
and sending MEN and INSTRUMENTS OF WAR flying --

ANOTHER SHELL explodes nearby -- TUMULT --

CAPTAIN BIERCE is hit and falls
COLONEL BELKNAP stares angrily at the sky

ANGLE ON JAMES WOOL

Running through the darkness illuminated by exploding
shells and flashes of gunfire

HIS POV -- the forest lit white up ahead

FOREST EXT EARLY EVENING

WOOL runs through the forest Other MEN are running too
trying to escape the ARTILLERY BOMBARDMENT

A PICKET rushes past him going the other way

PICKET
The REBS THE REBS

LIGHTNING illuminates GRAY UNIFORMS among the trees
Muskets crack and Minie balls fly past his ears
He turns and runs in another direction

A SHELL strikes a tree above him A branch falls and
hits him on the head
LATER

ANGLE ON WOOL lying stunned by the branch
Gray-uniformed legs run by

LATER STILL

Rain sleets down The sound of gunfire and explosions
is further away WOOL opens his eyes

He sees a figure crouching beneath the trees

amid the torrent It is GOULDING the soldier from

the FIRING SQUAD

A match flares as GOULDING tries to light a pipe

Alarmed WOOL tries to rise The tree pins him

He blacks out again

FOREST EXT DAWN

The chirping of birds The woods are full of mist

WOOL moist with condensation opens his eyes again

He is alone He struggles from beneath the fallen branch

and looks around

He sees the DEBRIS of the battle - abandoned muskets
forage caps corpses face down in a thicket

WOOL sneezes

FIELD EXT MORNING

WOOL emerges from the Forest and finds himself at the edge
of an untended field He sneezes again

In the middle of the pasture TWO FIGURES appear to be
engaged in a life-or-death struggle
One wears Union blue The other an old coat and floppy
hat

WOOL parallels the tree line drawing closer

HIS POV --

GOULDING stripping the clothes from a SCARECROW
ANGLE ON WOOL

Watching as GOULDING pulls off his Union blue and dons
the Scarecrows clothes

WOOL emboldened gives a shout

wooL
HO

GOULDING now dressed as the Scarecrow grabs his rifle
and aims it WOOL raises his hands

GOULDING
WHO HO

wooL
HO I mean hello

GOULDING
What you doing boy
(WOOL shrugs)
Got any BACCY

WOOL anxiously pats his pockets He finds a half plug of
Virginia tobacco holds it up for GOULDING to see
GOULDING beckons him with one hand rifle at the ready

wooL
You have ah unusual taste in apparel

GOULDING
Suits me better than that target
ye be wearing Have ye a pipe
wooL
I fear not
GOULDING
(searching him)
Whats that in your pocket

WOOL looks down at the leather-bound BOOK wilting in the
breast pocket of his uniform

wooL
The Holy Bible My mother gave it me

GOULDING
Tear us out a psalm

ANGLE ON THE BIBLE

As WOOL tears a dry page from the Book of Revelations and
uses it to roll GOULDING a cigarette

ANGLE ON WOOL AND GOULDING

Hunkered down in the middle of the field beside the remains
of the scarecrow GOULDING keeps a sharp eye on the woods

WOOL finishes the cigarette and holds it out to him

GOULDING
Got the Measles dont ye son

wooL
Yes sir

GOULDING shakes his head He takes the cigarette and blows
on it Lights up

GOULDING
Roll yourself one too

WOOL rips another page out of the Book
COUNTRY LANE EXT DAY

WOOL and GOULDING walk through the damp countryside
Gray clouds overhang the Allegheny Mountains
GOULDING carries his Sharps rifle Both men smoke

wooL
You must understand Mr ah
Im not a deserter it was a
mistake I was on picket duty
and I heard a noise Thought
it my duty to investigate
The Sergeant terrible mistake

GOULDING field-strips his cigarette keeping the tobacco

and throwing the paper away He jerks a thumb behind him

GOULDING
Armys back that way

They keep walking GOULDING in his Scarecrow outfit
WOOL in his mud-spattered Privates uniform

GOULDING
Best get yourself a change of clothes
RUINED FARMHOUSE EXT DAY
At the edge of a thick wood
GOULDING and WOOL lie in the undergrowth eyeing it

No one seems to be around GOULDING motions to WOOL
to advance WOOL complies uneasily

FARMHOUSE INT DAY

The Farmhouse is less than a shell Only one wall and

the chimney are standing The rest is matchwood
splintered and burned

Standing amid the matchwood is a WARDROBE which the
flames have left untouched

WOOL approaches it opens the double doors

There is a CORPSE inside It wears a yellow scarf and a
purple jacket Flies buzz around WOOL turns away in

revulsion

GOULDING pushes past him grabs the yellow scarf --

COUNTRY ROAD EXT DAY

GOULDING and WOOL walk on GOULDING wears the yellow
scarf knotted jauntily WOOL is dressed in the purple

jacket and old corduroy farmers pants He has brown boots

which are too big for him Smoke curls from their pipes

GOULDING
How long were you in

One year We all enlisted following
Manassas For the first six months
thereafter I was a washerboy I washed
the socks of the entire Brigade Now
I have had my fill of war

(extends a hand)
James D Wool from Dayton Ohio
And before you enquire yes I am one
of the Ohio Wools

GOULDING quickens his pace His stomach rumbles

GOULDING
Im hungry
TOWN EXT DAY
GOULDING and WOOL enter a small town There are a couple

of brick buildings The UNION FLAG flies in the square

BENEATH THE FLAGPOLE

A trestle table is set up Decoreated with red white and
blue bunting it bears the flags of Pennsylvania and the
United States and a sign reading US RECRUITMENT AGENCY
- TO ARMS YE SONS OF LIBERTY

WOOL hangs back afraid to meet the gaze of the one-eyed
RECRUITMENT BROKER and the TWO UNION SOLDIERS in the
Persian-style uniforms of the 114th Zouaves

GOULDING
How much money have ye boy

wooL
I have none

GOULDING
Uh huh

GOULDING hands him the Sharps rifle and to WOOLs horror
walks straight towards the RECRUITER WOOL backs into the
shadow of a Mercantile Store He watches as GOULDING
engages the BROKER in talk

ANGLE ON THE BROKER shaking his head
GOULDING persists speaking expansively

BROKER
Son I appreciate your desire to serve
the Union But theres no place for
blacks in this mans Army This heres

GOULDING takes off his scarecrow hat and turns it in his
hands He looks down keeping a big dumb smile on his
face all the while

to be The UNION ZOUAVES listen up

BROKER

The BROKER sheaafs through the reams of paper on his wooden

The ZOUAVES smile approvingly
GOULDING heads for the SALOON

ANGLE ON WOOL following him in

SALOON INT DAY

Long and narrow with a short counter at the end
No decor of any kind GOULDING addresses an old CHINESE
WOMAN

GOULDING
Food Any sort of food

A lot of it
(mimes drinking)
And liquor

The OLD WOMAN shouts to her DAUGHTER who runs into the
back She pours two shots of something labelled XXxXx
into glasses and leaves the bottle WOOL joins GOULDING
at the bar

wooL
You appear to have a plan although
thus far I cannot fathom it

WOOL stares at the whiskey as if he doesnt know what to
do with it He lifts his glass and takes a tiny sip
He coughs

GOULDING
Not like that Like this

GOULDING pours himself a shot and tosses it back
WOOL does likewise He shakes but does not cough

GOULDING
Always drink liquor quick

He pours two more shots The OLD CHINESE LADY brings bowls
and chopsticks
GOULDING
How much for a good horse

OLD LADY

Through the fly-specked window glass

GOULDING

WOOL sneezes

GOULDING

WOOL opens his mouth to speak He shuts it again
The CHINESE GIRL arrives bearing Chinese food fried eggs
and some fried animal GOULDING tucks into it

wooL
But there are two of us

GOULDING
(eating)
Well ride double up

WOOL thinks He drinks another shot He thinks some more

the service of the Union --

(hiccups )
-- in order to procure a nag --

(hiccups again)
-- and then DECAMP

GOULDING nods He continues eating More food arrives
WOOL isnt hungry any more His mind is racing

GOULDING motions him to eat
WOOL leans in conspiratorial

wooL
Do you do this often

GOULDING
(mouth full)
All the time

The TWO UNIFORMED ZOUAVES enter the Saloon
ZOUAVE 1

They shake their heads and stare at GOULDING still busy
eating and at WOOL lolling drunkenly in his chair

How come you served that Injun and not us

FADE IN THE SOUND OF GUNFIRE AND CANNON

from a far-off battlefield
RAILROAD TRACKS EXT DAY

Thunder mingles with the distant crack of Muskets and the
ping of rifles several miles away GOULDING and WOOL
enter frame on their old brown horse GOULDINGs Rifle
across his knee

They parallel a twisted mass of torn-up RAILROAD TRACKS

SALOON INT NIGHT

Crowded and loud Through the windows we see traffic in
the street indicating a larger town

WOOL is at the bar drunk and babbling to a roup of equally
intoxicated COAL MINERS wearing candle-wax-coated helmets
GOULDING stands nearby watching a CARD GAME

wooL
The Confederacy is like a mass of Cobwebs
woven around the limbs of an INFANT GIANT
They know not that they attack a NOBLE
and PUISSANT NATION rousing herself like
a STRONG MAN after SLEEP Shaking her
INVINCIBLE LOCKS

The MINERS all cheer SCANDANAVIANS they understand little
of what WOOL says But they are caught up in his Fervor
for the Union and wave their shovels and picks

wooL
WOE I say WOE to the Traitors who preach
an Accommodation with the FOE There can
be No Compromise until the Union is restored
and Jeff Davis dangles from a ROPE
MORE CHEERS and SCANDINAVIAN SHOUTS

Three cheers for GENERAL McCLELLAN
(ecstatic cheering)

SHERIFFS OFFICE INT NIGHT
The SHERIFF sleeps in a cell with a newspaper over his
face The headline on the paper reads “McCLELLAN RELIEVED

A tap at the door More snores The tap becomes a
HAMMERING The SHERIFF wakes

handbills saying TO ARMS ENLIST HERE etc

The SHERIFF cocks a SCATTER GUN opens the door

The SHERIFF nods He eyes a sheaf of DOCUMENTS

SHERIFF

revolver

GOULDING

SHERIFF

Six hundred fifty each

The SHERIFF tries to do the mathematics for himself
He fails and accepts GOULDINGs calculation

He unlocks his little safe and counts out 65000
The TWO MEN shake hands

JAIL CELL INT MORNING

JAMES D WOOL wakes up He sees the PRISON BARS
He moans The MINERS snore

The SHERIFF appears He hands WOOL a tin cup of coffee
through the bars

WOOL turns green and spills his coffee

SHERIFF
Vomitous eh

SHERIFFS OFFICE EXT DAY

The SHERIFF marches WOOL out the back door WOOL sweating
and shaking promptly pukes The SHERIFF drops him on the
ground

SHERIFF
Attaboy Better OUT than in Army1l

Piled up behind the SHERIFFS OFFICE are big crates and tea
chests marked Property of US Army and rows of brand new
axles and wagon wheels

Someone hammers on the SHERIFFs front door

VOICE
Sheriff I got hominy potatoes
and hard tack Couldnt get no
condensed milk though

The SHERIFF abandons WOOL and returns to his office
shouting to the MAN outside the door

SHERIFF
Dont nearly match what I got for you
Sergeant Five Norwegians and a Merican

WOOL looks around He sees to his astnoishment the old
BROWN NAG tied to the back gate

SERGEANTS VOICE
Ill give you a thousand for ‘em

SHERIFFS VOICE
Youre pulling my leg Look at the
shoulders on that Dutch Boy These
fine Volunteers are worth 15 hunnerd

WOOL drags himself over the gate He crawls aboard the
horse and spurs her She stumbles away

OPEN COUNTRY EXT DAY

WOOL clings sickly to his horse swaying wildly galloping
out of town

RIVER EXT DAY

WOOL rides up a stream beneath intertwined tree branches
He sees a leather book lying amid the pebbles at the
waters edge

It is his family Bible Half of the New Testament is gone
WOOL snatches it up and spurs his old mount on

EDGE OF THE MOUNTAINS EXT DUSK

The NAG collapses under WOOL

The OLD HORSE breathes hard WOOL remains in the saddle
He stares at the Mountain Range turning from blue to
purple in the evening air

A light glimmers at the base of the Mountains

Ignoring his horse WOOL stars to hike towards the glow

CAMPSITE EXT NIGHT
The campfire is almost extinguished A good-looking black
horse is tethered nearby A roll of blankets lies bunched

up beside the fire

JAMES D WOOL creeps very slowly into the dying firelight
carrying a large jagged-edged ROCK

He lifts the rock as if to dash it down --

The butt-end of a SHARPS RIFLE enters frame and SLAMS
AGAINST WOOLS HEAD

WOOL falls to the ground half in the fire half out of it
GOULDING sits down on his blanket roll and contemplates
WwooL

He helps himself to WOOLs tobacco searches his own
pockets for the Bible He cant find it

WOOL groans semi-conscious reacting to the flames
GOULDING drags WOOL out of the fire and goes through his
pockets He finds the Bible and tears out a page to roll
a cigarette

GOULDING
I wondered where the Good Book got to

wooL
(raising his head)
You scoundrel

GOULDING
Id mind my language ifn I was in
your shoes

He looks at WOOLs footwear WOOLs boots are worn
completely through GOULDINGs boots by contrast are
hand-stitched mocassins in top condition

wooL
I have done naught to merit an apology
Where is my money

GOULDING lifts the bottle from his blankets takes a swig
He sets it down again and stokes the fire

GOULDING
Done nothing is right You was supposed
to get them Miners moonshined not your
damn self
wooL
A slight excess of enthusiasm You owe
me half their bounties plus the entire
amount you earned for me

GOULDING
That Sheriff was an old fox He took
the lions share of the kitty

wooL
Just give me half of what you got

GOULDING
Howd you find me anyhow
I thought you a City boy

wooL
It wasnt difficult in the least

GOULDING
Well aint that right clever

GOULDING unpacks a bullet-making kit - a lead bar
miniature ladle and metal mould He holds the lead bar
in the fire to heat it WOOL stares at him waiting for
a reply

GOULDING
That moneys gone

wooL
WHAT

He offers WOOL a Bible cigarette WOOL shakes his head

GOULDING
After I enrolled you and those
Dutchmen I returned to the Red Dog
and wagered till it was all spent

WOOL wails and falls to his knees GOULDING waits for the
lead to melt He reads a newspaper It is dated April 18

GOULDING
Listen to this Report of the Battle
of El Picacho Westernmost Combat of
the War to Date Reported Loss of
Huge Shipment of Confederate Gold

WOOL groans shakes his head

GOULDING

(WOOL continues to moan)
Cut your snivelin Youre a free man

A COYOTE howls nearby Foxes answer WOOL sobs at the
absence of his money GOULDING puts the paper down
scoops molten lead into the mould

PRAIRIE EXT NIGHT
ANGLE ON COYOTES

Eating WOOLs horse

PRAIRIE EXT DAY

GOULDING rides past the half-eaten remains of the animal
Two vultures flap away

WOOL follows GOULDING He is on foot

How many times have you lepped the bounty

GOULDING
100 105

WOOL makes a notation in his Little Book

wooL
And how many other fellows have you

GOULDING

wooL
(scratching with his pen)
How large a remuneration did you earn
on each occasion

GOULDING
Between 12 and 600 dollars

WOOL writes more walking He whistles

wooL
Assuming an average bounty of 394
per enlistment you should by now

GOULDING
Moren that Gamblings been my
ruin and no mistake

wooL
And have you not the slightest
pang of guilt

GOULDING

wooL
Why taking the Unions money

GOULDING
Aint freed ‘em in Missouri yet has she
Or in Kentucky Only slaves Massa
Lincolns freed is in the damn South

GOULDING spurs his horse WOOL quickens his pace

wooL
But the Border States must surely follow
-- once the War is won -- the mans an
Abolitionist -- and a free thinker --

GOULDING reins up suddenly WOOL bumps into his horse
GOULDING sits glaring down at him

GOULDING
Listen up white boy This War aint

about MAKIN MONEY All wars is about
Makin Money Those that got the Most
Money WINS

wooL
Speaking of money I must insist that

GOULDING spurs his horse again

GOULDING
Do what yere told

He turns and trots away WOOL hurries after
wooL
What is your name by the by
I feel I have a right to know
if we are to be PARTNERS --

GOUDLING looks back at him A wind catches the
grass which starts to roll in waves

TIGHT ANGLE ON GOULDING

Off in the mountains beyond LIGHTNING flickers

GOULDING
Ishmael Goulding

He lead a mutiny aboard the slaver
San Dominick off Callao in oh 1822
Waited till they was in sight of land
and then he strangled the Captain with
his chains Hanged the passengers and
made the Portugee crew walk the plank
His people they sailed back to Africa

future in the New World --

and ESCAPED SLAVES UNDER GUARD streams an undending line
of WOUNDED MEN

Those who can walk or hobble on makeshift crutches
Those who cannot are carried by a seemingly infinite
procession of WAGONS and GUN CARRIAGES

wooL
It is possible
(coughs )
Just possible that I was impetuous
in suggesting we return to the ranks
of the Union It was the burning of

the building the hideous devilish
glare of the flames that momentarily
unminded me We were fortunate that

Colonel Belknap didnt spot us

He looks at GOULDING GOULDING does not look at him or
reply

wooL
You may rest easy though Ishmael
assured that even now I am devising
a STRATAGEM to extricate us

This is my plan the three of us will
creep around the rim of the canyon
descending there where there appears
to be a trail One of us will crawl
as close as possible to the Confederate
The other two will double back around
and take an elevated post on the rock
wall We will catch them in a crossfire
