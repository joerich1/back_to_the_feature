MOM
Ready set -- GO

They PUSH OFF and start down the hill WHEEE The
drawers skid over bumps carom against snowbanks The
girls and Mom LAUGH and SCREAM as they gain speed

At the bottom of the hill they SLAM into a snowbank and
spill into the snow They all LAUGH hysterically

MOM
Hey do we know how to have fun or do
we know how to have fun

LILY
We know how to have fun

As they dig their drawers out of the snowbank

MOM
And that’s what matters right Cause
if you’re not having fun peanuts --

LILY GWEN
(a familiar refrain)
-- what’s the frigging point

MOM
Exactly What’s the frigging point

They all put their drawers on top of their heads and head
back up the hill

Helen enters holding Gwen and Lily’s hands They sit in
a pew and take off their coats Aunt Helen PRAYS

She CLACKS her feet against Lily’s But Lily yanks her
feet out of range and looks the other way

Gwen sits there a beat more Then she notices the CASKET
on the altar She stares at it Then with Aunt Helen
still bent in prayer she gets up walks toward it

Gwen marches up to the casket gets up on her tippy toes
ul

and looks in There’s Mom laid out all peace Gwen
stares for a moment Then
GWEN
HEY

Aunt Helen looks up Sees Gwen peering in the casket

GWEN (cont’d)
She’s not in Heaven She’s RIGHT
HERE

AUNT HELEN
Sweet Jesus --

Aunt Helen jumps up out of the pew mortified

GWEN

corner When she’s done with the bed

AUNT HELEN
I cleared out that chest there You
can use it for your clothes
(beat)

AUNT HELEN (cont‘d)
This is just for now Till we figure
out something more permanent

She gives them each AN AWKWARD PAT on the head and
LEAVES

Lily opens her suitcase and starts unpacking Gwen
watches then pulls out a drawer and looks at it for a
moment She pulls it all the way out and looks at the
METAL RUNNER along the bottom She looks up at Lily

GWEN
Hey This one’s probably really fast

Lily looks at her Suddenly a cold angry little girl

LILY
It’s not a sled It’s a drawer Put
it back

Gwen looks at Lily neatly filing her clothes away and
thinks about this Finally she puts the drawer back and
starts unpacking Then under her breath

GWEN
It’s a sled I’m just using it as a
drawer for now

of taking one Gwen takes the whole tray from him

GWEN
It isn’t

As Jasper talks Gwen eyes the hors doeuvres hungrily
But she has a drink in one hand and the tray in another
The only way to eat them is to pick them up off the tray
with her tongue So that’s what she does

JASPER
No Nobody wants to come away from a
wedding with memories of perfection
and beauty They want to bring home a
story

li

NEARBY some GUESTS spot Gwen drunkenly licking cheese
puffs off the tray Whispers pointing “The sister”

JASPER (cont’d)
Something juicy Like the one
about the groom who ran off with the
maid of honor Or the bride whose
tits fell out of her dress during the
ceremony

He leans forward and licks an hors d’ oeuvre off too

a couple of dogs Then she spots Andrews Father among
the people staring and is mortified

floor with all the decorum of neutron bomb Normally

a safety hazard Every time he SPINS Gwen she THWACKS
into another Dancer Bam Bam Bam Backs whacked
toes stepped on hats knocked off Not that Jasper and
Gwen even notice They’re having fun for Gods sakes
He throws her over his head Her shoe flies off and hits

a woman He slides her under his legs Her dress flies
up - who cares

ALL AROUND THE RECEPTION people stare at them From her
place on the receiving line Lily sees the display sees

everyone talking and pointing She starts over to the
dance floor to put an end to it

Just then Jasper spins Gwen but instead of holding on
to her he accidentally lets her hand slip out of his
She goes flying across the dance floor

some CATERERS SPLAT CRASH Gwen tumbles to the floor

GWEN
No it doesn’t Theres a world of
people out there who do things right
ive right They don’t do drugs and
they don’t drink and theyre happy

JASPER

That’s a crock of shit No adult
human being is happy People are
born they have a mited time during
which they go around thinking life is
dandy but then inevitably at some
point tragedy strikes their heart
gets broken for the first time and
they realize life equals loss and the
point of the game is to minimize the
pain caused by that equation Some
people do it by having kids or making
money or taking up coin collecting
and telling themselves they’re really
122ze¢ because they snagged a rare

Sth century French sou And some do
it by getting wasted and letting
reality recede into deep focus every
now and again It’s all the same

GWEN
Nobody gets hurt if you collect coins

JASPER

Tell that to the lady whose husband
spent last month’s rent on that French
sou Everybody hurts everybody It’s

ANOTHER BOTTLE LANDING ON THE TABLE

Refills So much for just one glass Jasper keeps
drinking Gwen watches him It’s like he’s floating
away from her

Someone delivers a punch line Marty Elaine and Jasper
all CRACK UP Still not drinking Gwen tries to laug
along but it doesn’t seem that funny to her They seem
like they’ re having a much better time than she is

ANOTHER BOTTLE ARRIVES

As Jasper pours he KNOCKS Gwen’s glass of wine onto the
table It’s HYSTERICAL Jasper laine and Marty all
LAUGH No one notices that half the glass has spilled
into Gwen’s lap She looks around at them while she pats
her skirt dry Suddenly they look awful Leaden messy”

)

Like a bunch of sloppy pathetic drunks She feels their
chaos closing in around her and starts hyperventilating

Jasper puts his arm around her as he launches into a
story Gwen feels the weight of his arm his boozy
breath in her hair She suffers it a moment then stands

GWEN
Be right back

She grabs her bag and coat and gets up from the table

After a moment Jasper looks up from his wine and sees

Gwen walking by the window of the restaurant He gets up

and follows her
EXT DAMIANO’S - NIGHT

Gwen is a few paces down the block when Jasper comes out
of the restaurant in his shirtsleeves

Jasper Ina perfect world that

She trails off shakes her head and turns and starts
away from him

JASPER
Gwennie --

But she just bundles her coat tighter around her and
hurries down the sidewalk

When she rounds the corner she slows suddenly caught by
an overwhelming loneliness She sits next to a HOMELESS
WOMAN at a bus stop and starts to CRY

Gwen keeps her eye on the door watching the freshly-
showered players come out and head for their fancy cars
As each comes out the kids at the FENCE all scream his
name trying to get him over to sign autographs
Finally Eddie comes out Amid a chorus of “EDDIE’s

the line trying to sign everything Gwen waits as he
moves his way toward her
